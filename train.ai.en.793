that light above the door -- it's a video camera.
that's not enough to confirm Deans as Mr. Slippery, but we're definitely going in the back.
criminals and celebrities.
they never live up to the hype.
maybe he'll impress you when you get to know him a little better.
we're about to find out.
come on. Damn it! Open.
finally.
not bad, considering the guy clearly doesn't skimp on security.
the lock was professional-grade -- just...Don't.
there's no way 40 grand a year pays for all this.
this place screams supplemental income.
Fi, this is professional-grade.
he's got holograms and watermarks laid in under the laminate.
a book on Alexander the Great.
and an article on his sword.
and here we have infrared paint.
not something you just have lying around.
not unless you're Mr. Slippery.
hmm, that's strange.
I missed a call.
Michael... we got a problem.
Fi. Buddy. Got your text.
grove Marina Works. I'm about 10 minutes behind.
ditching my phone now, like you said, so I can't be tracked.
I never set a meeting with Buddy.
no. The thief did.
call him now!
Oh, damn it. Voicemail. He cut him off.
we're 20 minutes from Grove Marina.
I can make it in 12.
Michael, the antenna -- that shed is wired to blow.
Fi! - If you have a better idea, now's the time.
when an operative hears a gunshot, his first instinct is to identify where the shot came from.
when a civilian hears a gunshot, he might turn to locate the source of the shot or he might run straight for the nearest building, which is a problem if that building's been rigged to explode.
at that point, you may have to choose the small injury over the big one.
somebody's shooting!
nice shot, Fi.
you shot? You shot?!
well, it was either shoot you or bring flowers to your funeral, Buddy.
Hey, Fi, we can't leave a bomb here.
give me a shoe.
y-you want one of my Brunos?
give me a shoe.
what's the point of doing that?
what are you looking for?
he was here... He was watching us...
and he got away.
why the hell would one of my guards be so interested in my sword?
that's a good question, Mr. Bocklage.
I looked into every one of our employees.
they all checked out... even Deans.
well, you must not have looked very carefully.
his file was extremely suspicious.
we never gave you any personnel files.
I know. You made our job much harder.
we had to steal them from your H. R. Department.
by the way, the woman that runs it -- I'm not sure she can hack it here.
sir, I don't mean to speak out of turn, but these people just admitted to breaking and entering... twice.
they could have easily planted those photos.
you think we want to frame Deans?
we don't know you.
you could have done -- Let's make this easy
we'll show you how Deans is going to steal the sword, and you decide whether you're going to trust us.
you know how he's going to steal it?
we found I. R. paint in his house.
what the hell is I. R. paint?
there's a reason why most thieves work at night.
darkness makes it easier to commit crimes.
but darkness also makes it harder to see where you're going when you're trying to escape.
infrared paint is invisible in daylight but can be seen under a black light or with the help of I. R. goggles
useful if you need to find an exit in the pitch black.
what in God's name is that?
it's his escape route.
deans is planning to cut the power, swap the sword, and follow this path out.
he'll head down this hallway and go out of the building through that door.
you still think you can handle this guy by yourself?
I'm gonna call the police, have this Deans arrested.
you could, but he'll walk.
the moment Deans has the real sword, we've got him.
until then, we don't have enough to convict, not even on conspiracy.
this is a dangerous game you want us to play
sitting by, letting this thief lay hands on the sword.
well, it's less dangerous than it sounds.
we know exactly when he's going to make the swap.
he wired a shut-off timer to this room's power.
it's set for 8: 00 tonight.
well, what if you just took it off and let the lights stay on?
if we change anything, we risk spooking him.
when things go wrong, this guy gets violent.
he hit a museum in Kyoto last year.
it didn't go so well. He set off a bomb to escape.
the pictures aren't pretty.
throw your party, Mr. Bocklage.
leave the rest to us. We'll worry about Deans.
we have someone tailing him now.
we'll know the moment he enters the building.
your 3: 00 is waiting.
so, Sam's going to watch Mr. Slippery?
I guess he'll have to. I don't love the idea of Jesse alone with Kendra.
Oh, he can handle it.
the Libyans?
the Chinese?
go fish. - Come on.
lady... Seriously, aren't you bored?
are you getting tired, honey?
okay, if this was contract work, someone had to hire you, right?
now, we've been through every terrorist organization on the map. Was this a private group?
I'm sorry. I-I wasn't listening.
let me explain something to you.
you don't have forever, okay? You need to talk.
Really? You were put on a clock?
okay... How about we make another trade?
somebody looking to play a little tit-for-tat again?
come on.
there's got to be something you want.
I think the better question is, what do you want?
I want answers. - Please.
this isn't a cause for you.
this is a paycheck, and a small one at that.
what do you get paid for this deal?
25? - 30, tops?
what if I pay you 10 times that?
300, then?
for what? I mean. -- My freedom.
I can't have this conversation.
I'm not having this conversation.
I am done talking.
you got to ask yourself, how do you want all this to end?
you can say no, and wean sit here until the sand runs out of your hourglass.
or you can say yes, and I can put a lot of money in your pocket and you can show me the way out of this dump.
$300, 000?
there's an art to letting someone think they're corrupting you.
you can't be too eager or too reluctant.
you can't be too quick or too slow.
most of all, you have to sell the guilt in the eyes that comes with betrayal.
once they think they own you...
...then you make your move.
I'll take that as a yes.
yo. - Sammy boy, got some good news.
that's my favorite flavor. Hit me.
Kendra's bribing me into letting her go.
I got an account number and the name of a money manager.
no kidding.
well, that's impressive.
okay, I'll call Barry, get him to sniff around, see if he can track the money back to whoever hired her.
perfect. How's it going with you and the case of the rusty sword?
all's quiet on the Slippery front.
deans is laying low in his house. I guess he's conserving energy for the big event tonight.
cool. Hey, let me ask you something.
is it weird that I kind of miss you?
well, you have been hanging out with a homicidal psychopath, but, uh... Ah, it's a little weird.
I thought maybe I'd do an accent, you know, to really help sell this thing.
What?!
you know, I could talk like this.
that there sword is the real McCoy. Spot on.
no. No, no, no. No accent is better. Just talk like yourself.
okay. Let's do this.
who's he?
our antiquities expert.
he's gonna make sure the sword is real.
good afternoon. It's nice
waiting on you.
speak up.
Oh, uh, sorry.
Um...yes. I-I-it's real.
Mr. Bocklage, you're on the installation.
Karen will set the perimeter, so she'll see anyone leaving the building.
then we'll stay out of sight so Deans doesn't catch wind of us and stays on schedule.
then we all just wait for 8: 00.
michael Westen, if you knew you wanted me on perimeter duty, why did you let me wear my new party shoes?
they look stunning on you. Really.
this security thing is so boring.
Jesus. I wish I'd brought my gun.
what? What am I supposed to do if this gets all crazy-super-violent?
find a corner. Hide.
Yeah, Mike, you sure this Deans is our thief?
Yeah. Why?
cause I just watched him get blown sky-high.
somebody wired his car.
now he's hosting a neighborhood barbecue.
Jesus. - What's wrong?
we're chasing the wrong guy. Deans is dead.
what? What are we gonna do now?
well -- oh, God. T-that's the fake! The onyx.
that's the wrong shade, and...
Fi, has anyone left the building?
no, no one in nor out. Why?
the sword has been swapped. Deans is dead.
he wasn't Mr. Slippery.
Oh, God!
Fi, I got to call you back. - Oh, he's dead! He's dead!
what the hell's going on in here?
the thief has the sword.
what? But you told me was definitely Deans.
I was wrong! It wasn't Deans!
well, then, who was it? Why'd he kill my guard?
he must have caught the thief trying to swap the sword. - He's lying. He killed the guard.
No! No! We -- we found him!
Where's your head of security?
sir, he switched the sword.
listen to me. Listen to me.
the sword is still in the building.
we have to lock it down. - You're lying. Take him down. Now.
come on, Buddy.
get him! Stop him! They're getting away!
stop
in here, Buddy.
hydraulic arms are safety features that slow the speed a door can close, to minimize injury.
but wrap a belt around them, and they can be turned into an improvised lock.
Michael, what the hell happened?
Bocklage thinks we stole the sword.
security's chasing us.
well, I heard the explosion. I'm coming in.
I need you on the front door.
Fire-and-Rescue's pulling people out. One of them's got to be our guy.
okay, who am I looking for?
who did we miss? Was there another guard?
Fi, are all the firefighters wearing air masks?
Yeah, I heard one say a gas line blew. They're taking precautions.
why would the thief set off an explosion now?
Jesus. That's how he's getting away.
probably did the same thing at the machine shop.
he's dressed as a firefighter!
you need to get out here. I can't cover them all myself!
working on it.
Lungs...Burning...Badly.
all right, we're getting out of here.
how? Second floor.
what are you doing? - Making an exit.
are you serious?!
how are we gonna -- keep your arms in. Land on your feet.
tuck and roll.
it doesn't matter if you're a spy or a civilian -- falling isn't fun.
you can minimize injury by absorbing shock with your knees and rolling as you hit the ground.
but the most important thing you need to do is remain calm and accept that it's going to hurt.
tuck and roll?
what do we got, Fi?
a lot of firefighters went in. Only six have come out.
help! Help! Help!
never mind, guys. Sorry. I'm fine.
go, go, go!
what was that secretary's name, again?
s something. Uh, Sandy, Sally... - Selena. It's her. She's the thief.
Oh, Mr. Slippery is a woman?!
Jesus. She heard our whole plan.
buddy, reach into the duffel bag at your feet. Give me that rope.
what are you doing? - I'm going fishing.
no, Michael. I love that bag.
sorry, Fi. I never did.
to stop a moving car, you can kill the engine, kill the driver, or kill the tires.
if you only have a small amount of explosives, the tires are your target.
the trick is getting the charge in the right place.
get off of me!
get the hell off of me!
well, that is quite an accessory, Selena.
buddy! I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna
I have to be honest.
I didn't see that one coming.
there's Buddy's buddies.
how many of those have you had?
join me. Come on.
you can borrow one of my suits.
and, Fiona -- underwear...bikini... What's the difference?
Yeah. Maybe next time.
and maybe not. Right now, why don't you just drink up and be happy that it's all over.
yeah? - Selena's gonna be denied bail.
Bocklage is pressing charges -- grand theft, conspiracy, and murder.
I guess he took that explosion kind of personally, huh?
and what about that, uh, Deans guy?
well, he was a local convict she was paying to swap the sword for her, and when she learned we were onto her, she cut him off a little early.
she's facing that charge, too.
I-I can't thank you guys enough.
I mean, I sleep easy now, knowing that I've got a private platoon of guerrilla warriors at the ready.
let's try not needing a "platoon at the ready" anytime soon, okay?
Fiona! Uh, wait a sec.
I almost forgot.
I did this one for ya special.
buddy couture.
it's the best fake I ever made.
thank you, Buddy.
I-if you guys ever need me for anything, you know where to find me.
this can't be right. - It is, Mike. Barry checked.
Kendra's money went through six banks and four holding companies in five different countries.
Yeah, and that's just what we could confirm.
Barry said there's no end in sight, so, you know, we're not gonna be following the money to Kendra's boss anytime soon.
not many people would go to this much trouble to remain anonymous.
people who start wars for profit might.
so if the money's a dead end, what's Jesse planning?
we had Barry wave his magic wand and make it look like Kendra's bank account was drained.
paper trail starts out in the exact opposite direction that the cash came in.
I wonder how she's gonna take it when she sees the folks who sent her to Miami just ripped her off
probably not well, huh?
Oh, yeah. This is appointment television, baby.
Yeah, wrap your head around it, honey.
look, if you're confused, just admit it. I'll r-repeat myself as many times as you need me to.
you can't be serious!
Oh, I'm completely serious!
you see that right there?
you see it?
that is a zero.
a zero, as in, your account has been zeroed out.
this isn't possible! No one even knew about this account!
well, obviously, the people that paid you did!
think about it.
whoever sent you to Miami must have cleaned you out as soon as we grabbed you.
probably figured you wouldn't be needing it.
when you're interrogating someone with nothing to lose, you have to give them another reason to talk.
if you're looking to motivate someone who's cut off, alone, and convinced they're going to die, you can't beat revenge.
the son of a bitch doesn't get to just
what are you gonna do from that chair, Kendra, Hmm?
what are you gonna do?
you already know that I came to Miami to work a contract.
but there wasn't just one target.
I came to wrap up a big job. - Go on.
kassar was just the first part.
there were three other names on that tape drive, all operatives hired to rob a bank
a safety-deposit box.
but they blew it. They got caught.
they proved themselves expendable.
expendable to who? Who sent you?
if I knew his name, I'd tell you, believe me.
but he kept it anonymous.
I don't even know what bank they were trying to hit.
all I know is, it went down the 4th of last month.
you promise me one thing.
if this helps you track down the man that hired me, you make sure he knows that I'm the one that ruined him.
who's the predator and who's the prey now, mama?
I guess it's time to track down which bank they were trying to Rob.
find the bank, figure out what they were trying to steal.
might tell us a lot about who's behind all this.
all right. What do you want to do about her?
well, I faxed her prints to my guy at the FBI.
she came back with warrants, so I figured I'd just make an anonymous donation to their bad-guy collection.
I will get... the duct tape.
wait just a minute, Jesse.
first things first.
to the new guy, for putting that hot slice of crazy in the rear-view.
Oh, man.
it's gonna be weird not hanging out with her tomorrow, you know?
you could really use some more friends.
I'd work on that.
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing --no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
as a spy, you try to work only with an experienced team.
going into the field with someone who doesn't have the proper training is a recipe for disaster.
there are times, though, when having a civilian on an operation is unavoidable.
you want me to help you rob a bank?
in those situations, you just have to make your pitch and hope for the best.
I think I'm gonna need a drink.
let me clarify.
we're not robbing the whole bank.
we're just going after one safety-deposit box.
I think that's still considered bank robbery?
either you tell me what this is about or we're done here.
all right.
but this cannot leave this room, mom.
michael has been helping me with the investigation that I was working before I got fired.
there's someone out there starting some pretty nasty little wars.
they're assassinating leaders.
they'll raze an entire village just to make a buck.
and you're going to stop them by robbing a bank?
last month, they tried to steal this safety-deposit box.
the heist was a bust.
soon as they put a new team together, they're going to try to hit it again.
now, if we can get our hands on that box, it could shed some light on who these people are and what they want.
and you want me to steal the box?
no, no, no. All we need is your help to see how the security team reacts to the alarm.
I can get into the security offices to check out their response, but we need someone in the vault to trigger the alarm.
and all you have to do, mom, is the one thing I have never been able to get you to stop doing.
what do you say, Mrs. Westen?
feel like playing a little Bonnie and Clyde?
Bonnie and Clyde got shot.
look, the worst that's gonna happen is you'll get a fine.
come on, Maddy.
that's my partner in crime.
thank you.
in banks and other secure facilities, the biggest threats are the ones you invite in.
getting a job dropping off sandwiches requires fewer background checks than getting a job guarding millions of dollars, but it gives you the same access.
over here.
plus a tip.
thank you, man. - You're welcome.
okay.
got an egg salad.
most commercial facilities link smoke and security systems.
trigger one alarm, and you trigger them all.
smoke alarms work by detecting irregularly dispersed light.
setting one off with a cigarette requires a little time and a lot of lung capacity.
it's the vault! Go check it out!
you all don't mess around.
that's a whole lot of fuss over a little nicotine fit, huh?
lighting up in there is against state law.
grandma's getting arrested.
she'll do jail time.
get what we needed?
Yeah, but, uh...
they're coming down a little harder on your mom than we thought.
that doesn't look like a small fine!
Yeah, I know. They're taking her downtown.
look, we better just hope she doesn't say anything, man.
say anything"?! She opened up a bank account, Jesse!
they have her address!
they have her name, her social security number!
they can't take her downtown!
I know, Mike! That's what I'm saying! Hold on! That's what I'm saying, man!
she's getting arrested?!
we got to spring her before the cops get involved. That's what we got to do.
you don't...
some getaway drivers you are.
mom, how'd you... - that nice man was so sympathetic.
I told him that I was smoking to calm my nerves.
that I was very upset putting those pictures of my husband in there,
and I just couldn't help myself.
first thing Frank's been good for in 30 years.
get in the car.
I'm telling you this bank we're hitting has got more guards than Buckingham Palace.
there's two here, three back here, and two more over here.
I mean, even if we get around them, we're not gonna have enough time to drill into the vault.
okay.
did you hear what I just said? That was bad news.
it's a law firm on the second floor.
their security -- not quite as good.
all we need to get in -- key card.
okay, so, we swipe a key card.
then...You want to blast our way into the vault through their conference-room floor.
they're lawyers. They have it coming.
someone's looking nice.
Hey, what can I say? I clean up good.
we're working security for some business bigwig's dinner party.
told us to dress up and blend in.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there.
you're working with Sam, huh? - Yeah.
I thought I'd partner up with someone who values my opinion.
I'm just here for my Walther.
I've got a trunk full of guns, and nothing fits in my clutch.
what did you do?
hurry up, will ya? He said not to be late.
this coming from a man who spent half an hour shellacking his hair.
you should be grateful.
most married men let themselves fall apart.
Charles Finley had a shotgun wedding for the sake of his cover.
that's Charlotte, the old ball and chain.
call me that again, and we'll have a shotgun divorce.
let's get this party started.
don't ask.
I hate these parties.
no matter how many I throw,
I never get used to wearing a monkey suit, dancing for investors.
damn it.
darling, let me help you with that.
this is Sarah -- My better half.
pleased to meet you.
Fiona, right?
"Charlotte" for tonight.
"Charles..." ...For whenever it's needed.
I'm so grateful you could come on such short notice.
so, what's got your cummerbund in a bunch, Mr. Aitkens?
well, someone is out to nab Liby.
it's my company's new lithium ion battery.
she's lighter and longer-lasting than any of my competitor's products.
they'd pass a paperweight to get their mitts on her.
so you think someone's trying to steal her -- or it.
somebody broke into my car yesterday.
luckily, all they got was a laptop with a few personal e-mails and some Garth Brooks mp3s.
could've been worse. Could've been Creedence.
any idea who we're looking for?
I believe we are looking for a man or a woman who would like to become filthy rich.
now, I'll tell you this -- if they're smart, they'll pose as an investor here tonight.
if you're so concerned with the guest list, why not call off the soiree?
tonight's Liby's debut.
I have to show her off to whet market appetite.
but I can't have either of you spooking my investors.
now, I want you to blend in, keep your eyes peeled.
if you catch the thief, you know... Shoot him.
uh, don't give her any ideas.
I think we should get the lay of the land before the festivities start.
well, if there are any break-in attempts up here, we'll know it.
Christian's got more security than the Batcave.
see anything out of the ordinary?
other than a computer that requires a retina scan or a toilet that plays bird songs while it blow-dries your unmentionables?
when you're working a protection detail, it's all about observation.
you're looking for broken locks, blocked motion sensors
the subtle signs that someone's trying to breach security.
of course, some security breaches are a lot more subtle than others.
it's the caterers. I'll get it.
get in there. Get down.
what? Wha... - get in the tub.
Hey, what the hell is going on down there?
we got party crashers with automatics.
Hey, I got to get down there!
No! Christian, you stay put! - We have to...
but... - do not come out!
they got an Uzi on full auto pinning me down.
FI...They're not coming up here.
they're coming for you.
this sounds like a kidnapping, Sam.
and I got no way out.
I' m gonna have to wave the white flag.
Fi, no. It's too dangerous.
what are you doing?
don't let them know who I am.
but your gun -- aren't you gonna...
look.
if I start shooting now, we're both gonna wind up dead.
we'll roll with the punches.
trust me -- when the time is right, we're gonna punch right back.
wait! Where are you taking Sarah?!
does Christian owe you money?
I said shut up, bitch!
please -- Whatever you need, my husband, he can take care of it.
what did you say? - My husband...
he has much money.
dial Mike.
Yeah, Sam. How's the party?
there were four guys, locked and loaded.
I tried to stop them, but they got the client.
and, Mike... They got Fiona.
well, when they stole my laptop, they got everything they needed
pictures of Sarah, details about the party, our address.
all this time, I thought it was about business.
so stupid!
well, it was about business -- just a different kind.
you said these guys had accents, right?
got the bullets to match -- 9-millimeter black-tipped iMIS.
all the rage in Mexico City.
mexico City? What the hell is he talk？
below the border, express kidnappings are big business.
looks like somebody expanded stateside.
I checked the hospitals.
nothing.
still no chatter on the police band.
my buddy pulled traffic cams, but he got zilch.
these guys are ghosts, Mike.
Yeah, we got a webcam call from your wife's account.
looks like they're ready to talk.
gentlemen... I believe I have something you are looking for.
Sarah? Oh, my God!
let him do the talking.
well, well. I see a new face.
who invited you?
you can call me Vikner.
I'll be negotiating the release of Mrs. Aitkens and Mrs. Finley.
you know the drill.
I need to hear from the women.
it's a good sign if kidnappers wear masks and shy away from cameras.
by protecting their anonymity, they protect their hostages.
if a kidnapper lets you see his face, he's probably not planning on letting you live to testify against him.
Christian... Baby, they want $10 million for each of us.
please, just pay them the money, and they'll let us live.
I love you -- aah!
thank you, Sarah. That was wonderful.
the best products always sell themselves.
$20 million is quite a price tag.
we'll need some time to get it together.
do you think I didn't do my homework?
Mr. Aitkens is worth twice that -- liquid.
a man in your line of work needs unmarked, nonconsecutive bills.
can't exactly scoop that from under the couch cushions, can we?
you have 24 hours. Not a second more.
are we understood?
we'll get you the cash, but we won't pay for damaged goods.
do not...Hurt them.
you just don't be late.
tardiness makes my trigger finger... Itchy.
I can probably get a trace on their I. P.
forget that! I'll pay! I can get the money!
money won't save them.
they want $10 million for each of us.
you know, FI's not the type to get all teary-eyed over a gun to her head.
she's sending us a message.
please, just pay them the money, and they'll let us live.
one long blink, one short, then three more long.
she's blinking "no" in Morse code.
if we pay the ransom, the girls are dead.
the floor! Come on!
I apologize for my kid brother.
eddy's a good guy. He's just a bit of a hothead.
please... Just don't hurt us.
I wouldn't dream of it.
as soon as we get our payday, I let you go.
honest.
now, ladies, sit tight.
don't cause any trouble.
everything will go smoothly.
make sure our guests are cared for.
wait, wait, wait.
you're not gonna leave us here with him?
what's the matter?
you don't like your chaperon?
H-he's been eyeing us n-nonstop.
is this true? - No. No. He wasn't.
I don't want to cause trouble.
Jesus, Sarah.
I saw the way you were looking back at him.
you think you can flirt your way out of this?
he's not your goddamn tennis coach!
kidnappers see hostages as commodities.
like a good stockbroker, they'll protect their investment until it's time to cash in.
if they see a risk, they'll hedge against it.
now, be good girls.
no more fuss. Okay?
high-maintenance women are more trouble than they're worth.
I'm sorry. I needed to buy some privacy. Can I borrow that?
my earring?
your jewel-encrusted lock pick.
they're right outside the door. They're not gonna
relax. This should only take a second.
what are you doing?
we're gonna get out of here.
but what about the FBI? Now, they could...
get your wife killed very quickly.
we're up against pros here, Christian.
they get one whiff of police involvement, it's over. We need some guns.
take FI's car. Her trunk is an armory.
I should come with you.
more boots on the ground... - The noisier we'll be stomping.
200 of Christian's closest friends are gonna be calling about why his party was canceled.
you need to keep them from getting too curious.
I'm on damage control?
we're controlling a lot more than damage to his reputation, Jesse.
if the press get ahold of this, Fiona's dead.
I'm counting on you.
ready to ride?
where are you going?
you promised you'd tell me all about our bank heist over breakfast.
what's the matter? You don't like doughnuts?
mom, FI's been kidnapped.
kidnapped? What the hell are you talk
we were doing a security job, and the client's wife was taken. FI went with her.
the client's upstairs with Jesse.
they're working on keeping this quiet while we track down the girls.
well, I'll wait with them.
there must be something I can do.
mom, we got this covered. You should go home now.
I'll go home when Fiona does.
you go find your girlfriend.
creating an explosive device in the field requires a strong knowledge of chemistry and the ability to improvise with whatever equipment happens to be lying around.
can you hold that?
an old fire extinguisher makes an ideal compression chamber.
add some metal shavings and the right cleaning supplies, and you can serve up a bomb that will blast through a cinder-block wall.
why is it you can never find a good sodium hydroxide solution when you need one?
I need to get to the bathroom.
they said if we don't make trouble
Sarah, we're already in trouble. We saw their faces.
the moment they get their money, they're gonna kill us.
christian won't let that happen.
he'll save me. He'll...
sometimes you have to be your own white knight.
trust me.
what do you want me to do?
give me that.
I need you to work with me.
and we will get out of this alive.
what are you doing?!
getting a hall pass to the bathroom.
the guard has cellphones. I need to get to his bag.
could you, uh -- ooh -- give me a hand?
get this lunatic off me!
don't you pull my hair, you bitch!
ladies! What's going on here?!
you're the bitch!
Charles will pay a hundred times for me what Christian would pay for you--just you wait.
what did I say? Look at you.
madre De Dios.
look at that cut. The negotiators will not pay for this.
get her cleaned up.
get your filthy hands off me, you fat
you're a thug!
almost took my arm off!
you can't buy grace, can you?
unlike that nose of yours.
kill you!
No! I'm going to kill you!
if you don't stop fighting and behave yourself!
you're a bloody mess.
go.
so, Jesse said the kidnapper's I. P.came from this address.
either they really like lattes or they're boosting the signal.
fi could be anywhere within a mile.
that's a lot of summer homes to check out.
Hello? - Michael, it's me.
Fi! - She got a phone!
that's the woman I married.
get my message? - Yeah, loud and blink.
but don't worry -- We kept Christian from backing up the money truck.
well, there are two brothers in charge.
they're playing nice right now.
the second they get their money, the gloves are coming off.
any idea where you are?
no.
but it's about to have one less wall.
we still have 20 hours.
it's one of you against four of them.
don't feel bad for them, Michael.
wait. What about Charlotte? Isn't she coming with us?
hang on.
I'm afraid Charlotte is not as fortunate as you.
your husband was the only one who paid.
No!
Michael, Christian made a deal for Sarah.
no, no, no. Jesse's with him. He couldn't...
I don't know how it happened, but it happened.
you know that -- that 20 hours we had?
it's more like one.
come on.
well, I don't see anything but summer homes and drop-tops.
not a white panel van or a creepy safe house in sight.
call Jesse.
damn it! Pick up!
you've got him spinning public relations, keeping this quiet.
maybe he's tying up the lines.
he should have been tying up Christian, not buying Fi and Sarah a death sentence.
okay, Mike, just don't kill Jesse.
we need him right now.
Fi's got to be around here somewhere.
Mike, how's it going?
Finally! What the hell are you doing?!
what are you talking about?
christian cut a deal with the kidnappers.
you think maybe you should have told me about that?
wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where's all this coming from?
fi got a call out.
sounds like we got about an hour before they dangle Sarah for the cash and put a bullet in both of them.
no, no, no. No. No, no.
he's been on the phone the whole time.
he -- he stepped out on the balcony...
he stepped out on the balcony to get some air. Damn it!
you can beat yourself up about it later. I'll help.
right now, you need to find out where the drop is.
and if Christian pays these guys, FI's dead!
Mike, I'm gonna make this right.
Where's Sarah?
after your little catfight, I thought it best to... Give you some space.
you didn't kill her, did you?
where would you get such a crazy notion like that?
Mrs. Sarah is gonna be worth very much very soon.
what do you mean?
her husband paid... Didn't he?
perhaps you chose the wrong man.
could you do something about this heat? I feel like...I'm gonna die.
Oh, we wouldn't want that.
I'll take care of the air-conditioning.
Fi. Are you all right?
never been better.
how's Sarah?
I don't know. They separated us.
I think they're getting ready to move her.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
my exit strategy's almost ready.
but then I'm working on a different way to get into her room.
no, no, no. I want to be there before anything starts to blow up.
how gallant.
Hey, guys, maybe you can argue later.
right now, Fi, just give us a description of the house
something we can go off of here.
well, I can do better than that.
I'm sending you a smoke signal.
don't call me. I'll call you.
a good smoke signal requires dense, visible clouds of smoke or vapor.
you can't just light whatever's handy on fire and hope for the best.
rubber burns with a thick, black smoke -- that's perfect.
put a burning pile of it in an air-conditioning duct, and the house's ventilation system will carry it out where it can be seen from a distance.
you need to call him back right now and call it off, Christian.
no, it's like I'm saying to you -- I can't call it off.
they said the deal was final!
if I back out now, they'll kill her!
I can't tell you anything!
calm down. I want you to think back. Okay?
What'd you do the last time your wife was kidnapped?
I've never been in this situation.
I know that. We have.
you hired professional security consultants. Do you understand that?
tell me where the hand-off is happening so we can do our job!
Oh, you know, you're pretty clever with words, Mr. Porter.
now, you can make me feel like a rube, but it doesn't change what I think, which is that I'm dealing with businessmen.
now, which of us has more experience in that arena?
you're missing the point here.
look, look, I feel bad.
all right?
and if it's any help, I'll loan you the $10 million for Miss Glenanne's ransom.
you know what? Save it.
you can name a hospital after your wife when she's dead.
don't you dare talk... - what's it gonna take for you to get it?!
you saw Fiona's message. You're gonna get her killed.
she blinked!
I am not risking Sarah's life on a damn eye spasm!
she was sending us a message!
No! No!
Jesse... You're upset about FI, and it's showing.
now, how do you expect this guy to give you a level-headed decision when you're about to tear his arms off?
all right.
I'm gonna -- I'm gonna go get some air.
I mean, what did he expect?
I couldn't just do nothing.
they have the woman I love.
he doesn't get it.
I think he understands exactly how you feel.
so, Mike, you can tell me to shut up if you want, but what's going on with you and Fi these days?
I disappointed her.
the way I got Jesse burned.
the way I'm using him.
she thinks I'm a little too obsessed with finding out who freed Simon.
she might be right.
Mike. Where there's smoke... There's Fi.
water!
please don't leave me here!
shut up, all right?!
I'm coming!
there's your water. Happy?
alcohol was used as an energy source and a weapon long before anyone had any idea what gunpowder was.
it doesn't contain enough energy to qualify as a top-grade explosive, but in most situations, it's a lot easier to find a bottle of vodka than a brick of C-4.
thank you. - Good. Let's go.
well, you know, I was hoping for something just a little bit stronger.
this isn't cocktail hour, honey.
I'm starting to think you don't understand the seriousness of your situation.
I think I do.
Charles... Isn't gonna pay.
is he?
you know something?
you and I a-aren't that different.
how's that?
well... We both know what we want... And we take it.
the only difference is, is... You use a gun, and I have... Other charms.
playing the role of Mrs. Charles Finley.
you want to know a secret?
I never did love him.
so you married him for his money?
well... It wasn't for what was happening between the sheets.
and now... When I need his money the most, it's... ...It's not there.
once Sarah's husband pays for her, you're not gonna let me go, are you?
now... How about... ...You give a girl one last drink, let her say goodbye to her best friend?
I'll give you your drink.
but your friend Sarah... Is already on her way... Home.
well, then... ...Here's to homecoming.
won't you let me keep the bottle?
God.
you decorated for me.
sorry, but... ...It's easier this way.
how much longer do I have?
who knows?
maybe Eddy gets caught up in airport traffic...
or maybe your husband calls after all.
but if he doesn't... It won't be too long.
well, at least you're finally being honest.
one more favor.
some gum?
that cheap vodka tastes like lighter fluid.
I think I would have liked to know you...In a different life.
you mean the next one?
we're both going to hell.
handcuffs can be a hostage's best friend.
the same steel that locks you up can set you free.
use the cuffs for leverage and apply enough pressure, and you can break the weakest piece of whatever you're chained to.
but it might not be the only thing you break.
perfect timing, FI.
the cavalry has arrived, darling.
tell us where you are. We're coming into the house.
no.
they're headed to the airport.
they took Sarah.
it sounded like they were going to Miami international airport.
that's not enough to go on.
I'm not leaving you... - no.
y-you can't come in here guns blazing.
one call from Jacob, and his idiot brother will kill Sarah before they even make the drop.
so you're gonna stay in there and play chicken with this guy?
but Jacob and his fat friend don't know we're playing.
I'll figure out where the hand-off's gonna happen, and I'll let you know.
fine. I'm going after Sarah.
but I'm leaving Sam here as backup.
you be careful in there, missy.
Chuck Finley is too young to be a widower.
Yeah, well, don't worry about me.
I am not your "average trophy wife."
if you don't tell us where the hand-off is
I've talked all the sense I can to you people.
I even offered to pay Miss Glenanne's ransom.
if you'd have listened to me, your friend would be on her way to safety by now.
no, no, listen, the only reason Fiona's not home safe right now is because she chose to go with the kidnappers
to get us some leverage to save your wife.
and that doesn't sound insane to you?
aren't no leverage as good as $10 million.
I'm paying! That's final!
the second they get the money, your wife is dead.
you're not going anywhere until you tell me where they're taking Sarah.
get out of my way.
michael still can make it in time to save your wife.
they'll kill her if I don't pay!
I can't -- I have to -- I can't just sit here and do nothing!
I get it. You're covering your ass.
this is just another business decision for you. Right?
you don't know what's gonna happen. None of us do.
but this way, you pay the ransom, you got your story for the funeral.
did everything I could.
even though it's a damn lie.
you son of a bitch!
that's my wife you're talking about!
that's right. That's your wife you're giving up on.
okay.
the lighthouse at Cape Florida.
my C. F.O.'S meeting him there with the money.
call him off.
you could save his life, too.
good old guilt trip -- works every time.
you're telling me?
I'm a mother.
Jesse, tell me you got something.
the drop is happening at the Cape Florida lighthouse.
drive fast. It's going down in five.
only 10% of a 60-watt bulb's energy is dispersed as light.
the rest is heat.
fill one with a flammable liquid, and it only takes a couple of minutes for the bulb's warm glow to turn into burning shrapnel.
what? What is it?
please, I-I can't take this anymore.
let's just get this over with.
what?
no, it's not time yet.
Oh, yes, it is.
I-I said my prayers. I made my peace. I'm ready.
soon. I'm sorry, but you're my plan B.
if there's a problem with Sarah's payoff
don't make me beg!
just one -- one last request.
one last drink for the road?
not the head. Not my head.
I deserve an open casket.
don't I?
Yes, you do, Charlotte.
Yes, you do.
my name is not Charlotte, bitch!
Hi, honey. I'm home.
good.
you can help me take out the trash.
force, power, and torque are the measure of any sports car.
but on winding roads, the key to fast driving is fast braking.
four-piston disc brakes will kill speed quickly and smoothly...
allowing you to keep your foot on the gas longer.
what is this? - "What is this?
I guess you'd call this a barter situation.
Where's the money?
I got something better.
actually, it's better if you just shut up and put the gun away, unless you want to find out what it's like to be an only child.
where are you holding him?
call your brother. Ask him.
Charlotte speaking.
wait. Where's my brother?!
Oh, you know, Jacob can't come to the phone right now.
he's kind of screwed at the moment.
you put him on, you little puta!
careful, Eddy.
this puta has a bomb underneath your brother's cojones.
check out that photo again.
you see that fire extinguisher?
it's a highly pressurized hydrogen gas bomb.
so hand over your guns, or your brother's gonna be more than a little bowlegged.
you won't do it! You don't got the guts! You're just a scrawny little pendeja!
thank you, Jacob.
come on! Move!
guns, too.
give!
you know, you were right.
the best products really do sell themselves.
Gracías.
now, how do you say "not good enough"?
take a look at the photo again.
take a look at the watch, Eddy.
the bomb is on a timer.
15 minutes.
at this point, I would call the cops.
as I was saying, I don't think you're gonna make it there on time.
the smart move is to call the cops.
what do you expect me to do -- confess?
either that or get a vacuum cleaner to pick up your brother.
either way, I don't really care.
christian -- where's he
he's fine. I'm taking you to him.
so, what kind of a timer is attached to a bomb with duct tape?
you know, your brother is kind of an idiot.
Vaya con dios, Jacob.
look at that hole, Sam.
you really do like me, don't you?
well, I wouldn't go that far, but you're growing on me.
you tell Sarah what an idiot her husband was?
no, I think she knows.
Yeah, they always do.
thanks for breaking him.
looks like Los Hermanos Grimm got what was coming to them.
I was listening on the police band.
they snapped up Jacob, grabbed Eddy at the airport.
that 911 call's gonna play great at their trial.
well, just goes to show you, man -- payback is a...
you should see the other guy.
it's kind of late. You got a hot date?
no. I'm, uh... Hitting the gym.
relax, Jesse.
I know you boys are robbing the bank tonight.
we try not to talk about our upcoming felonies. You know.
some things are better left unsaid, huh?
Jesse...This might be one of those things.
Fiona and Michael love each other, and they hate each other.
but it's always... Each other.
Yeah, I know. Why? What -- what
it's probably nothing.
I just...Saw how upset you were when Fiona was in trouble.
well, you know, Fi's my friend.
I, uh... Really, I know -- I know she and I aren't, uh...
I just want what's best for them. That's all.
and I believe you.
you just might want to work on that poker face.
Bonnie, Clyde. What's going on?
nothing. I was just giving Jesse these.
Fiona took them as a souvenir.
I thought maybe they'd come in handy.
that's really nice of you, mom.
Jesse, you ready for the fastest minute of your life?
let's do this.
Mrs. Westen.
thank you.
the security of a safety-deposit box is less about the box than what's guarding it.
banks spend all their resources keeping thieves out of the vault.
once you get in, every last dime can be had for the price of a rota-tip drill bit.
once you've got what you came for, the trick is just getting out before security shows up.
there's nobody in here.
let's see what's behind door number 64.
family bible? That doesn't make any sense.
the people we're looking for aren't religious.
it's a book code -- a cipher.
well, what do you think it decodes?
I don't know.
but answering that question is our next move.
the life of a spy demands a kind of cool detachment.
when your job requires you to keep secrets and break trust, you learn to keep people at arm's length.
it's one thing to lie to an asset.
wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait. Wait. What was that? Wait, wait.
back of the -- no, at the beginning.
the inscription there -- it says "Simon.
who's Simon?
any idea who that is?
it's another to lie to a friend.
I have no idea.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...Family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line
as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
when you're preparing to interrogate a trained operative, the most useful information isn't professional
it's personal.
Escher star
you need to get into the target's head...
...Understand what makes him tick.
of course, that's easier with some people than others.
Hi, FI.
you hear that, Michael?
the shooting range is calling your name.
love to, but Vaughn gave me homework.
today's the day.
Vaughn's checking Simon out of whatever hole they've been keeping him in so I can have my face-to-face.
well, I can't imagine he'll be too thrilled to talk to the man who put him in that hole.
who knows? He might surprise us.
as I recall, Simon is full of surprises
escaping from prison, kidnapping you, trying to blow up half of South Beach...
leave it to you to invite him back to Miami.
he was working with some pretty bad folks, FI.
whatever they're hoping to decode with Simon's bible, whatever they're planning...
Simon's the key to all of it.
nice digs, huh, buddy?
Vaughn
quite a party.
Yeah, well, with Simon, you can't take any chances.
never have fewer than six eyes and three guns on him.
that's gonna be a problem. I want him alone.
Vaughn, if he was gonna talk to you, he would have done it by now.
good luck.
I mean, the only thing I learned from him is he has a remarkable tolerance for pain.
Yeah, well, my approach doesn't involve sharp instruments or electrodes.
I don't care if you want to cut out his kidney with a pocketknife or give him a gallon of orange sherbet.
one way or another, we want some answers.
I have been dreaming about this moment for months.
so have I. But I wouldn't exactly call my version dreaming.
fair enough.
Simon
so, how you like being Vaughn's shiny, new toy?
where is he, by the way?
this is just between you and me.
if this conversation goes well, maybe I can help make your time with them a little more humane.
"Humane"?
that's one thing that's not in their bag of tricks, Michael.
so, let's get to it.
what do you want?
I found your bible. - Is that right?
well...
I hope you found solace and comfort in the word of the lord.
not exactly. Somebody else was trying to steal it before I got to it.
I need to find out who.
you know...
I have been stuck in these shackles for months now
given me a lot of time to think about the bible, particularly my favorite verse.
handcuffs, like anything metal, are vulnerable to metal fatigue.
give someone enough time to work on them, and they'll break down just like anything else.
John 8: 32.
you shall know the truth, "and the truth shall set you... Free"!
no bugs down here, Michael.
we got 30 seconds before the guards get here, so listen close.
I got a present for you.
there's a cemetery at 3rd and Grand.
go to plot 837. There are some keepsakes of mine in there, including an audio tape labeled "Berlin 2007."
Simon -- listen! - You got to be careful digging it up, but I think you're gonna find it real interesting.
we'll talk about the bible after you hear what's on that tape.
Oh, here they come.
let's make this look good!
I'll kill this son of a bitch!
let me out of here!
get him out of here!
you all right? Did you learn anything?
Yeah.
you should replace his handcuffs more often.
I have no sympathy for you, Michael.
you are damn lucky...
Simon didn't cut you to ribbons.
he wasn't trying to kill me.
he was just passing me a message.
he told me to go dig up an audio tape he buried at Grove Memorial Park.
you know, Mike, maybe you should leave the dead to their eternal rest.
this is either a wild-goose chase or a trap.
Oh, Simon basically told me the thing is booby-trapped.
but I don't think he would have bothered if there wasn't something on that tape worth listening to.
unless it's a rare Beatles bootleg,
I don't know why he didn't just tell you what's on that tape.
me neither. But Simon's not talking until I get ahold of it.
wait, you're going back to see him?
I told Vaughn to keep him around while I tried to come up with a new way to crack him.
you are a glutton for punishment.
actually, I can't go after the tape by myself.
Vaughn is playing nice, but he's watching me.
I could use a little help on this.
Yeah, love to, but I got a thing.
hot date? - Not exactly.
buddy of mine's in prison down in Dade Federal pen.
he's worried that his life is in danger.
anyway, sorry, Mike. The guy was an asset of mine in Colombia.
he saved my butt. I owe him.
I'll go find a shovel.
Hey, Juan.
you're looking... Well rested, buddy.
good to see you, Sam.
so, I got a call from your attorney.
he said you thought your life was in danger?
damn attorneys. They don't know when to shut up.
he was just supposed to talk to you about some estate issues.
estate issues. Right. As in, when you're dead.
Juan, come on. I doubt that you would have appointed me as your executor out of the blue.
why don't you just tell me what's going on?
have you heard of La Nación? - The prison gang?
Yeah. One of the biggest around.
there's a guy, Cruz. He's high up in it.
found out what I was in for -- thought I could help him out.
he wanted you to wash some money?
no. Steal it from the gang.
but, see, you're a smart guy, and you don't have a death wish, so you said "no.
Oh, Juan. Getting mixed up with the Colombians was one thing.
you know, they didn't give you much choice. But this?
you think I had a choice?
how was I supposed to survive eight years in here?
anyway, he said that if I helped him skim from the gang's account, he would protect me.
and so now the gang's after you.
no. He is.
I have a week left on my sentence.
he's afraid I'll talk when I get out.
he's spreading the word that I disrespected him so it doesn't look suspicious when he shanks me.
I just heard about it this morning.
I'll be dead by tomorrow.
Juan, you got to talk to the cops.
I mean, maybe we can get you transferred.
I'm not gonna snitch on Cruz. They'll investigate the whole gang.
I might as well invite La Nación to my family's house for a barbecue.
they'll kill everyone.
Juan, there's got to be something we can do here.
I wish there was.
can I count on you to take care of Lisa and the girls?
Yeah. You can count on me.
Juan
when you realize you're being followed, escaping isn't always the best option.
if your pursuers don't know who you are, driving evasively, calling the cops, or pulling a gun will just send the message that you're a threat.
411. How may I help you?
Yeah, I'm currently on Northwest 12th Street.
I need the address of the nearest criminal defense firm.
one second. That would be Keller & Associates.
they're at 77 Shore break Lane.
whenever possible, the best play is to make the bad guys think you're not someone to worry about.
if they think you might be a cop who's onto them, you have to convince them you're just a harmless attorney working on an appeal.
Oh, hey, counselor.
listen, you know, I've been going over that case, and I wanted to, you know, talk to you about it a little bit.
excuse me, who are you? - Oh, excuse me.
you don't remember the Bennigan subpoena?
no, I don't. - Oh, come on. Hey, think harder, man.
Hey, Sully! What's going on, buddy? How you doing?
uh, Bennigan. Hmm. Let me think.
forget it. Gringo's just a lawyer, man. Go.
was that the guy who got murdered over the parrot?
uh... No. But, boy, that sounds like an interesting case.
catch you later.
you want to break in to prison?
are you insane?
I mean, I can't protect my buddy from here.
Juan is out in a week. How bad could it be?
this is prison, Sam. I-I'm just guessing, but I think it could be pretty bad.
I owe this guy.
back in 95, I led a S. E.A. L. team down to Colombia, you know, as a "drug war" thing.
well, the Medellín boys put a bomb in our hotel, but Juan tipped us off.
okay, I understand you want to be loyal.
this guy risked his life and his family, and I'm not gonna let him get killed by some prison-gang lowlife.
that lowlife had you followed on your way out of the prison.
even if you were to get back in, they'd recognize you.
okay, so I'll shave my head or whatever.
no, Sam. You can't.
I'll do it.
you would do that for my friend?
I'd do that for you.
okay. I hate to interrupt this, uh, beautiful moment you guys are having.
explain something to me.
you're just gonna walk up to a federal prison and say, "let me in"?
trust me, I know a couple of people who would love to see me locked up.
Hey, don't forget to write, Westen.
FBI
got to say, Westen -- been looking forward to this day for a long time.
except, in my dreams, it plays out a little different.
I'm sure. You can fly?
you get a longer stay, for starters.
maybe next time. You make the arrangements I needed?
it wasn't a problem. You're sharing a cell with this guy
Juan Ruiz, whoever the hell this is.
a friend of a friend.
our butts are on the line here, Westen. I know we owe you a favor.
a big favor.
all I'm saying is, anything goes wrong, it gets splashed back on us.
I'll make sure I don't make waves.
we left you a present in your cell
a phone -- just in case you get into trouble.
you'll be the first one I call.
guess we'll see you in a week, Westen...
if you survive that long.
every environment has its rules and customs, and your survival often depends on knowing them.
in Russia, you never refuse vodka, in Pakistan, you always clear your dinner plate, and in prison, you're careful about making eye contact.
too little eye contact, and you become a victim.
too much eye contact, and you become a threat.
either way, you're never more than a couple of blinks away from getting a shiv in your back.
I'm Michael Westen. I'm your new cellmate.
what are you in for?
just keep talking and try not to look surprised.
I'm a friend of Sam Axe.
I'm here to make sure you stay alive until you're released.
I don't understand. How did you get in?
that's not important. What is important is that from now on, you never leave my side.
like that.
that is an example of leaving my side. Don't do that.
this is crazy.
didn't Sam tell you about Cruz?
he's a big dog in La Nación.
you think you're gonna keep him away from me by yourself? In here?
I guess I'll just have to do my best.
listen, I-I appreciate what you're trying to do.
but this guy has killed three people since he got locked up.
when he wants someone dead, they die.
do yourself a favor. Stay away from me.
is that what you want me to tell your wife, your kids -- you gave up?
why are you doing this?!
because I believe your life is worth saving.
it's time you started to believe it yourself.
that's him. That's Cruz.
told you it's not safe to be with me.
Cruz
see the way he's staring me down?
no. He's -- he's just checking out the new guy.
what are you gonna do? - Make nice.
I'm Mike.
who are you, Mike?
Oh, I'm just a guy wrongly accused.
big misunderstanding.
you know, I borrowed a friend's car,
got popped for a kilo of coke in my trunk.
lawyer says I can beat it -- - you two friends?
him? O, he's -- he's my cellmate.
Really?
cause it looks like you and that punk-ass are pretty tight, hanging out like a couple of school girls.
that's funny -- school girls.
just so that we have no... "Misunderstandings," okay, this is my house, and you're just a guest.
so, I can treat you like my friend, or I can treat you like my bitch.
friend, please. Friend. - Okay.
I don't want any trouble. - Okay.
is there anything I can do for you, you know, or not do?
do you want me to be some place at some time or not some place or Juan to be -- to be or not
questions -- too many questions...
you want to make that court date, you'll make no problems for me, okay?
if I come by your cell, you clear out. Comprehends?
Sí, sí. Comprehends. Uh, no problems.
okay. Okay. - Fun. Done.
go back to your pendejo collie over there.
I'm starting to think this is just Simon's version of a sick joke.
well, so long as you're the punchline.
you know, that's a cruel thing to say to a sweaty man who's digging for a bomb.
old cemeteries are great hiding places, as long as you don't mind desecrating a grave.
people don't often go digging in cemeteries, and unlike buildings or houses, they don't get demolished or remodeled.
bury your stash near an old, nondescript headstone and there's little chance anyone will uncover it,
unless they're meant to.
look what we have here.
doesn't look like it's booby-trapped to me.
why don't you come down, help me get this baby out?
No! No, no, no! Wait, wait! Don't touch it.
what?
this has got a silicone seal. That thing's airtight.
And? - Whatever's in there ignites on contact with air.
probably a sodium metal.
open it... Boom.
best not to move it, either. It may have a trembler sensor.
Oh, I see unstable minds think alike. So, now what?
see that liner?
I think I know how Simon planned to get into it.
we need a circular saw and some machine oil.
we'll have to come back to defuse this little toy.
well, I don't know which one of us has a more dangerous gig
us or Mike. - Probably Michael.
we don't have to eat prison food.
you gonna eat that?
in the jungle, the first warning that a predator is approaching is silence.
when violence is imminent, animals instinctively know that keeping quiet and still is their best shot at survival.
prison's a lot like the jungle.
silence is not a good sign.
averted eyes, stockpiled food, and guys wearing heavy coats on a warm day also indicate trouble's on the way.
I don't like that look. Are you gonna be sick or something?
it takes a little while to get used to the cuisine here, but it's good.
no one's come within 10 feet of us in the last 15 minutes.
see the looks?
my guess is Cruz is gonna make his move soon.
Jesus.
we got to find a place to hide.
Where's the library?
this place has to have a law section, right?
it's a little late to file an appeal. I already served eight years.
case books usually come in thick, hard covers.
we need the big ones.
get it?
suits of armor fell out of fashion because the added protection isn't worth the trade-off in speed and agility.
flak jackets and bullet-proof vests are popular because they allow for a free range of motion.
the key is to shield your core and mentally prepare for strikes against your unprotected arms and legs.
all lightweight armor is vulnerable to some extent.
layered book cardboard won't stop a bullet, but it's dense enough to thwart all but the sharpest blades.
let's go. - Why? You think he'll find us here?
I don't know. But if we stay here,
Cruz can come at us from too many different angles.
we need to get to a more defensible position.
you got some place in mind? - Your cell.
what? - Elena and Sarah, my girls.
I was just saying their names.
listen. We don't have to win.
we just have to survive long enough until the floor guard arrives.
looks like the floor guard is not helping us.
he's with Cruz.
we're gonna have to wait for the block guards to come for us.
get up there.
what are you gonna do with that? - Fight them off.
with a hand towel?! - Why? Do you have a gun?
take off...
guys, we don't want any trouble.
maybe you didn't hear me.
you got five seconds to clear out.
fighting in tight quarters with your back against a wall may cut off escape options, but it creates a chokepoint and forces your opponents to form a single-file line.
if you have to fight a group, it's better to take them one at a time.
get back in your cells. Get back!
now! Everyone back!
he missed! - I don't know who you are, but if you think this is over, this is not over.
I'm gonna throw a big party here tomorrow, and this whole place is gonna get crazy.
and the two of you? You're my guests of honor.
see that guy that Cruz is talking to?
that's the head of the South Dade Aryan Nation.
that is... Not surprising.
the S. S. tattoo kind of gave it away.
it doesn't make any sense.
the Aryans are always at war with La Nación.
exactly. So why not make money from starting one?
that's a negotiation.
Cruz is gonna start a riot.
that's what he meant by "having a party."
Cruz is smart.
his first attempt raised security.
he knows you're safe now here in the cell, but a riot will give him the chance to kill you when the guards are distracted.
Jesus. We're dead.
only if we stay here. Keep an eye out.
where did that come from?
the FBI, believe it or not.
told me to use it only in case of emergency.
now seems like a good time.
Hey, Mike, how's your stay at the Greybar?
lots of rugged men lifting weights, glowering at each other?
Hey, does your phone have a camera on it?
you guys are funny. I'm in prison.
Yeah, sorry, Mike.
watching Juan's back isn't gonna work.
Cruz is too powerful.
he's planning a riot to kill us.
we're gonna have to break out.
a prison break?! Mike, Juan has, like, a week left on his sentence.
and I'm telling you he's leaving early
as a fugitive or as a corpse. It's our choice.
can you use the riot as cover?
that's the plan.
there's a crooked guard named Hill on the cellblock.
it looks like Cruz is paying him off.
think you can lean on him?
Yeah, anything you need, brother.
got to go. I'll text you.
that didn't sound good at all.
Yeah, well, this doesn't look good.
gonna have to do something about grandpa there before we can dig up Simon's stash again.
well, you're gonna have to get some reinforcements.
I got to go pick up Jesse and run down this Hill character for Mike.
you sure this guy Hill is in Cruz's pocket?
I mean, 10 years as a prison guard.
he's got a little house, leases a compact sedan.
just doesn't look dirty to me.
he's not in it for the money.
hill's brother is doing a five-year stretch up in Ocala for burglary.
la Nación has guys in that joint.
if Hill doesn't play nice with Cruz...
little bro's cell turns into death row.
and you're thinking the fact that this guy's getting blackmailed is something we can use to blackmail him?
look, leaning on a guy who's already squeezed doesn't exactly give me the warm fuzzies, okay?
but Mike's life is on the line here.
all right, it's showtime.
you gonna help me or not?
Yeah.
george Hill, right?
who's asking?
just a couple of guys looking for a favor.
got some friends staying in South Dade Correctional.
they're looking to check out early, and you're gonna help.
Yeah, I don't think I will.
now, get the hell off my lawn before I call the cops.
you know what? That's a great idea. Let's call the cops.
we'll tell them how La Nación is threatening to kill your little brother in Ocala.
just takes one phone call to open an investigation.
of course, I wouldn't want to be your brother once it gets back to Cruz that you ratted him out.
no. - My brother is just a kid. He's not
we don't want anything to happen to your little brother, okay?
you do your part for us, we'll do our part to get rid of your Cruz problem.
what's my part?
well, first, you're gonna tell us everything about South Dade Correctional's riot procedures.
it's not a great color on you.
great to see you, too, FI.
so, how's it going with Simon's buried treasure?
well, it's being guarded by a groundskeeper who's a little older than most of the people in the ground.
Sam's busy with this, so I'm gonna have to recruit your mom to help me.
Fiona -- - I don't want to argue.
we only have a few minutes, so let's focus.
I can't stop thinking about you, baby.
at night, it gets so bad.
am I talking to you, perv?! No, I am not.
you want to keep your nose out of our pillow talk?
you been thinking about me, too, baby?
I think he's gone now, Fi.
you're no fun, Michael. Anyway...
our friend Hill has been quite the help in getting your early release.
once Cruz starts the riot, you and Juan have about 20 minutes to get to the infirmary and hide inside the pharmaceutical locker.
as if the prison wasn't already claustrophobic enough.
well, Hill said the thing's industrial-size.
it's standard procedure for the guards to move it off site as soon as a riot starts.
they don't want any inmates raiding it during a commotion.
won't the guards look inside it before they drive it off?
Oh, they probably will, but it'll be Sam and Jesse.
hill lent them his uniforms and a key card.
Sam is busy forging copies of it.
there's just one problem.
the door to the infirmary will be locked.
some things you have to do for yourself.
okay, that's enough!
you be good, baby.
is it just coincidental that both Michael and Sam are unavailable for look-out duty?
they are busy helping a friend.
aren't they always?
should I worry?
honestly, I would be more concerned about...
our little assignment than theirs.
well, that's reassuring.
chemicals like sodium metal will burn when they come into contact with the moisture in the air, which makes them ideal triggers for particularly nasty booby traps.
high school chemistry also teaches us that oil and water don't mix.
so to defuse a booby-trap triggered by moisture, you submerge it in oil.
it's messy, but it'll keep you from being blown to bits.
Oh, it's like Russian nesting dolls. It's cute, huh?
Oh, don't worry, it's safe now. It's totally harmless.
no, no, no. It's not that.
um, what do you people say? "I think we have company"?
Oh, damn it.
look, I need a sec to get this out and cover it up.
could you, uh... - Yeah.
I thought I saw somebody over here.
are you in charge of this place? !
I'm the caretaker.
you tell me what that truck is doing here.
what does it look like? I had to hire a landscaper.
madam, you can't do that. That's not authorized.
someone had to take care of Quin's grave.
you certainly haven't.
would you look at me when I'm talking to you?
you people have no respect. I'm grieving here.
I'm dealing with the pain of a very serious loss, and you're just letting his grave go to hell!
do you have any idea how painful that is?
ma'am, are you confused? This is a historic cemetery.
everybody in here has been dead for over a century.
well, it's not about how long it's been.
it's about how much you love somebody.
my great-great... Great-uncle Quinton...
has been so important to our family.
I-I'm sorry. We'll try to do better?
thank you.
uh, Mrs. Becker, I'm done. Are you ready?
all right.
Bye.
the riot will probably start in one of the common areas.
now, when it does, the guards will try to lock down the cellblocks and move in to stop it.
that's when we'll make our move all the way over here to the infirmary.
you think the guards will be too distracted to see us?
if Cruz throws the kind of bash he's promised, they'll have their hands full.
I don't want to get my hopes up too high, but this sounds good to me.
but then again, I've never really broke out of prison.
no, neither have I.
you two. Come with us.
where are you taking us? - Time to see the barber.
what's wrong with our hair? - Let's go!
what's happening?
I think Cruz's party is about to get started.
should we run? This is Cruz's cellblock.
until the riot starts, we have nowhere to run to.
what is this? - It's the end of the line, I guess.
we're supposed to be responding to a Code Black in cellblock A
when this goes down. Now, the deal
I know what the deal was.
attention, we have a Code Black in progress.
mobilize response team immediately.
there's gonna be a lot of bodies when this is done
a lot of guards, inmates...
snitches.
let Michael go.
he's got no beef with you.
he had no beef with me.
it would've been quick for him with my shiv, but now...
it's gonna be slow and painful for both of you.
let's go! We got to move! - I think it's broken.
put me down. You're never gonna be able to carry me through there.
it's the only way to the infirmary.
the guards will have already locked down the yard.
we have 10 minutes!
you did your best. I appreciate it.
but Cruz is coming. You got to get out of here, or you're dead.
we're already set up to get someone out of here.
if you're staying here, I guess Cruz will have to leave. Come on.
okay.
get in here. Keep your head down.
how are you gonna get into the infirmary?
I'm working on it.
down on the ground!
down! Down!
all the way! Get down!
Hey, buddy, how you doing?
down! Get down! - Thank you.
this guy Cruz is no joke.
he's really stirring up a hornet's nest.
well, let's hope Mike and Juan are not in the middle of it.
Mike, you and Juan all right?
I'm fine, but Juan's leg is busted.
he's not making it to the infirmary.
Mike, he has to. - He can't, Sam!
that's why we're gonna give Cruz an early release.
Mr. Westen, you're a very clever man.
Cruz is already looking for us.
if he found out that we're holed up in the infirmary...
I'll make sure that he does.
what? - Yeah, hey, your pal Cruz is hunting for my friends.
I want you to make sure that he gets the message that he can find them in the infirmary.
one of Cruz's guys has a phone.
I... Could call him.
George, just remember your brother now.
you do this, and Cruz is not gonna be a problem anymore.
but you got to do it fast.
all clear. - Thanks, pal.
I said keep your head down.
any medical facility is going to contain plenty of combustible material.
pure oxygen can pack a punch if paired with the right accelerant.
the same properties that make Ether a powerful anesthetic also makes it extremely flammable.
alcohol is used to sterilize wounds.
pour it on the floor, it can also make an effective fuse.
why don't you make it easier on yourselves, pendejos?
get out here!
any place where lots of dental lab work is done on the premises will have a butane torch.
it's used to cast molds or teeth out of wax.
it can also be used for any other task that requires a controlled, pointed flame.
run!
Yep. This looks about right.
I guess Cruz finally got a taste of his own medicine.
okay. Okay. - I need a little help here.
Hey, you're not going back out there.
not without an FBI escort.
agent Harris?
you said to call if there was trouble.
you want to be a little bit more specific, Westen?
few incidents inspire a police response as intense as a prison break.
is
local, state, and federal authorities come after a fugitive with everything they've got.
dump an escaped prisoner someplace, give him a gun, make a few calls, and you can guarantee he'll make a lot of new friends in law enforcement.
Freeze! Don't move! On your stomach! On your stomach!
get on your stomach!
hands behind your back! Hands behind your back!
I don't know, Westen. It felt more right when I was walking you in.
I got to say, I kind of agree with you.
I'm not sure you don't deserve another stretch
full-blown riot, prison-gang leader tries to break out of jail, and now several guards are admitting to taking bribes.
you had nothing to do with that?
you really want to know?
no. I guess we don't.
all right, well, thanks for the update. I owe you.
well, that was my buddy at the U. S. Attorney's office.
they're going after Cruz?
well, it looks like somebody else already did.
apparently, the day after he was taken into custody,
la Nación got wind that his hands were in the coffers of the gang
decided to take matters into their own hands.
I don't know how I can ever thank you and Michael.
no thanks necessary.
I promised you your family would be taken care of, and they will be...
...Cause they have you back.
hang on. Hang on.
okay, go.
I'm not gonna miss the unveiling of Simon's treasure trove.
coroner photos and...
high-school yearbooks.
it's a rare combination.
here we go. "Berlin 2007."
this is the tape Simon wanted me to hear.
and you're gonna meet with Simon tomorrow to talk about this.
given my last go-around with Simon,
I told Vaughn I wanted to control the security this time.
Simon and I are going to, uh, meet outdoors, maybe along the beach.
how romantic.
Vaughn. Hello?
Hello? Who is this? - I'll give you one guess.
Simon? - Surprised to hear from me?
where are you? - I'm right behind you.
no. The end won't come that quick, not like it did for the men you sent for me.
you'll find what's left of them in my hotel room.
Simon, I don't know what you're
please, don't.
I take it you've chosen to terminate my services.
you gave us no choice.
we know you've been working against us.
whatever will you do without me?
Oh, we found a replacement
very promising. The name's Westen.
if he doesn't work out, there'll be another.
the work continues.
well, I guess this is goodbye.
I thought Vaughn told you he had nothing to do with burning you.
obviously, he was one of the people who pulled the trigger.
so, Mike...
what are you gonna do?
I heard the tape.
now I know Vaughn helped choose me.
I want to thank you for that.
Hallelujah!
therefore, rejecting all falsity, let everyone rejoice in the truth with his brothers.
that's what we are, Michael... Brothers.
whatever you say, Simon.
I still want to know what the bible decodes and who's after it.
the man who tried to take the bible
he's not like you or me, Michael.
we're just pawns in a very, very large chess game.
but he's...
well, he's more like a King.
last time I checked, a pawn can still take a King.
I guess we'll find out.
the man's name is John Barrett.
ring any bells?
the C. E.O. of Drake Technologies?
the same. Makes sense, if you think about it.
a multi-billion-dollar corporation with holdings in telecom, infrastructure, tech...
whatever they destroy, they can rebuild.
quite the business model, wouldn't you say?
Simon, what does the bible decode?
I'm not gonna tell.
but let's put it this way
if you deliver that book to Mr. Barrett, he'll have everything he needs to wipe out Vaughn and his ilk completely.
let him, Michael. You'll be free...
free to go gunning for Barrett yourself if you feel like it.
why tell me any of this?
I would have worked with the devil himself to take down those sons of bitches that burned us.
sadly, the devil's not available.
I'll have to pin my hopes on you.
go get them, brother.
I'll be damned.
how did you get Simon to talk, Michael?
he tried to convince me to kill you.
I let him believe he convinced me.
should I be worried?
I just told a psychopath what he wanted to hear.
so what's next? You go after Barrett?
well, it's not that simple.
with a guy like Barrett, you can't go in with guns blazing.
it calls for a more...
surgical approach.
you're not done yet, but you made a hell of a lot of headway.
here's to you, partner. I'm glad we found each other.
me too.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls...
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
Vaughn. I take it you've chosen to terminate my services.
we found a replacement, Simon.
the name's western.
I thought Vaughn told you he had nothing to do with burning you.
here's to you, partner. I'm glad we found each other.
Vaughn not Michael's partner
me too.
so that list is the key To destroying the people who burned me?
people are gonna die if that thing gets out. Lives are gonna be ruined.
the people on that list burned you, so this is your call.
we need to hand this over to the government.
you think I'm lying about this list?
look, if you expect me to help you get back in,
you're gonna have to go on the record about the people who burned you.
Marv Guy from the government
Marv, I can't sit on this list forever.
all right, I'll let you know the time and the place.
this is the list?
Marv, who are these guys?
Jesse, I'm sorry.
No! No!
Jesse, wait!
Tyler Brennen part-time spy full-time sociopath Jesse, I'm sorry.
Marv, what the hell are you talking about? What's going on?
No! No!
when a soldier loses a friend in battle, his commanding officer keeps a close eye on how he copes.
if his judgment is affected, he is removed from combat so one fallen soldier doesn't turn into two.
spies in the field take the same precautions.
but without a strict chain of command, the decision about who stays in the game and who gets sidelined can get messy.
brennen just called me.
he wants me to meet him at the Carlito in an hour.
great. I'll go with you. Just in case.
Sam, if Brennen wanted to kill me, He would have shot me when he took the noc list.
I'm just gonna go talk to the man.
Yeah, and I'm going.
Yeah, I'd like a word with him, too.
Ooh, mike, that's not a good idea.
wait. Excuse me?
Sam, if you got something to say, you better say it to me.
look, I know you're upset, but I don't think you get it.
brennen isn't just some arms dealer.
he kidnapped mike's brother.
he once strapped a bomb to a kid.
the guy's a mega creep.
I don't give a damn if he's Satan himself, all right?
one way or another, he's gonna tell me how he got Marv to flip.
no, he's not, Jesse. Sam's right.
you're gonna sit this one out.
the hell I am. Mike, it's not your call.
Marv wasn't your friend.
you're right, he wasn't, but if he had been,
I'd expect you to stop me from doing something stupid.
he's right, jess.
we've all been there, mike included.
there's gonna be fallout from Marv's murder.
the fact that it happened here in Miami, Cifa's gonna want to talk to you.
I need you to sell them a story that gives us enough time to operate.
okay, so I'm supposed to just sit on the sidelines
and lie to the only people that are looking for the truth?
okay. Then, it sounds like a Michael western plan to me.
he'll get over it, mike.
$122, 654. 37.
that's how much I've spent in the last year Keeping tabs on my favorite burned spy.
very invested in Michael
thanks?
no, actually, I should be thanking you.
because you led me to good, old Marv.
and without him, I never would have been able to pry the list out of your hands.
this, uh, little network of people that burned you Is very promising.
talk about high-value targets.
okay, so you're here to, what, take a victory lap?
little bit, but mostly it's a business trip.
I'm here to get spy guy to slit a few dozen throats.
Oh, now, don't give me that look.
you're going to love this -- trust me.
you want me to kill the people on the list?
Ding-ding, Michael western!
you get revenge. I get money.
everybody goes home a winner.
and if I say no?
you won't, because if you refuse,
a very special audio file gets sent to, uh
what is he, your boss, your keeper?
anyway, the man you know as Vaughn.
Marv gave you mike's debrief?
you mean my Michael western summer-jam mix tape?
indeed. Fun stuff.
and if, uh, Vaughn ever gets a listen to you outing his little secret society,
he's gonna kill...Well, you and you and Fiona...
this new guy, Jesse...
possibly even mama western, - Nate. - How is Nate?
I sent him a Christmas card and never heard back.
you're working your way to a point. I can just feel it.
meet your first victim.
government employee 132g-something.
I did some digging. He was an operator in Indonesia.
he's currently living in Miami.
the list just had his federal I. d. number.
your job is to turn that number into a name, And that name into a corpse.
if you have his government I. D.
you just need to access the federal employee database.
wrong, Mr. Westen.
you just need to access the federal employee database.
okay, so you want us to just waltz into some FBI building
and politely ask them to use one of their computers?
I'm gonna go out on a limb here, Sam,
and guess you're not the brains behind this operation.
computers that can access the federal database also live in federal courthouses.
did I go too fast? Are you lost, Sam?
don't take my silence for confusion, Brennen.
I was just trying to kill you with my mind.
okay. Killing me wouldn't solve your problem.
that audio file is scheduled to be e-mailed to Vaughn every morning at 5: 00 a. m.
the only thing stopping it, me.
Oh, god, uh, one more final little detail
I brought in someone special...
to help you with the killing and me with the keeping you in line.
he's a big fan of yours.
uh, may I present...
Hey, kid!
Larry Michael's biggest fan spy with 9 lives and I was hoping for a smile.
Michael, you're thinking about this all wrong.
brennen is giving you a hell of an opportunity here.
Oh, yeah, right.
brennen is forcing him to kill in cold blood.
he's not forcing him.
come on -- the Michael I knew would've sliced a bloody swath through that list.
the Michael I knew would've left a trail Of twisted, broken bodies lying in his wake.
and the Michael I knew would've done it all with a smile on his face.
that was beautiful, Larry.
ever think about writing poetry?
guys, we need to focus.
the network at the Miami federal courthouse
will give us everything we need.
I got to say, I don't like where this is going.
Oh, good news, Sam You don't have to like it. You get to stay home.
Mike, can you talk to the jackal, please -
sorry to make this awkward, kid, in front of, you know,
but none of your friends are invited to this party.
just you and me. And this time, you don't get a choice.
Oh, my. What is that?
this is rebar, Larry, see, cause,
I'm gonna wipe that 5, 000-watt smile off your face!
come on! Sam! What are you
Sam, what the hell are you doing?
we got to get to Brennen. Can you get Larry's cellphone number?
Yeah.
what the hell do you let this wet rag hang around for?
I mean, he's just holding you back.
you know what?
you two deserve each other.
good luck with your murder spree, mike.
Yeah, Marv called me a few days before he was killed.
you know, "how's the fam?
I saw your marlins took a beating.
we should grab a drink. "Just
whatever. Friend stuff.
did he say why he was coming to Miami?
I asked him. Didn't go into any detail.
I just figured he was working a case.
and then when I went to I. D.
his body, I found this among his personal effects.
I didn't want it falling into the wrong hands,
so I picked it up, figured you guys would come calling.
these are notes on the Sinaloa cartel.
Yeah. I-I d-don't -- I don't know what that's about.
Marv and I never worked a case against those guys.
but I haven't really been up on the latest. You know.
well, thank you for this, Mr. Porter.
anything you need.
Hey, if you don't mind me asking...
how's the investigation going?
we'll be in touch.
glad to help.
who kicked your dog?
just lied to my old agency.
told them Marv was working a cartel case off the books.
doesn't look like you had much fun.
no, no, this whole thing
it puts a black mark on a -- on a good man's record.
my point is, I don't think you would have done it if you didn't have to.
Yeah, well, of course not. But so what?
man had a wife and two daughters.
they're never gonna know why he died.
I feel like the whole thing's my fault.
I feel like
I feel like I should call them or something.
is that safe? - No.
you know, when my mom was killed,
I didn't know the whole story for a while, for like a couple months. Everyone was trying to protect me.
but when you lose someone close like that, the truth
it matters.
well, from what I understand about this situation,
it sounds like the truth might hurt just as much as it might help.
if you're gonna go "helping" anybody,
you might want to think about what Marv's family needs first.
I'm just saying.
I don't get it, Larry.
you're not exactly a "taking orders" type of guy.
why work with Brennen?
Oh, the math isn't complicated.
he's got the list And a solid plan to turn it into cash
using some of my many talents.
so you're just employee number two?
come on.
you know the funny thing about this world
is that people lose stuff all the time.
and sometimes it's taken from them.
I see a very bright future for whoever holds that list.
and it's not gonna be Brennen forever.
believe that.
so, what's your plan here?
well, I think we start with some ass-kicking
and then some name-taking.
I think we hit the fire alarm, Slip past the metal detectors in the confusion,
grab a guard to get into the computer room,
and then, boom, one body to dump.
that's one more than we need.
we can do this without guns.
what in the hell happened to you?
my way's fun, too.
we can play it like St. Petersburg, '94.
Oh, you mean, lawyers instead of diplomats?
and this time I'll let you be the boss.
Oh, you'll let me?
okay, fine. Fine. We'll try it your way.
I'm gonna need your cell number.
I'll call you later.
michael got Larry's number.
we should be all set If everything goes smoothly in there
and they call Brennen with a name.
give me about a minute head start.
I'm gonna go scare up some paperwork.
adds a nice touch.
why don't I grab you some coffee while I'm at it?
Ooh, yeah, only if they've got those little cortaditos. I love those things.
Tom Nickerson.
Hi. How are you?
listen, I need to get all the archived files
on, uh, judge Schapiro's Kingdon industries trial.
docket number bl2435.
okay. Kington industries.
judge Jonathan Shapiro.
looks like there are over 1, 000 files in that case.
and there doesn't appear to be a nickerson listed here in
Yeah, well, see, the old attorney Was fired for being incompetent.
I'm taking over. I need you to get everything out here pronto.
right, well, I don't see a note in the file Saying there's been a change in counsel.
I'm sorry, but I can't ...
Oh, Jesus.
there's been a pretrial conference going on for 10 minutes.
I have a judge waiting for me.
I need those files right away.
Yes, sir?
Yes, yes, judge shapiro.
how are you, sir?
counselor, where the hell are you?
get your ass up here now!
y-yes, sir.
you are really going to regret this.
I got -- I got the substitution of counsel forms.
did you get the archived files?
no, no, I'm still waiting for someone to go get them, yes.
did you tell him about the judge?
Oh, I tried to, But he's not feeling particularly helpful today.
we'll tell the judge that we're just not getting Any cooperation down here...
cooperate!
and let him burn for this!
you're gonna burn for this!
Yes. What's your name?
what is your name?
uh, I'll be right back.
here we go.
Larry, I'm typing in numbers.
it's easier if you don't count!
I get the picture.
Hey, lookee, lookee.
Larry's making a call.
used to expand mobile coverage to places without service , femtocells reroute and boost cellular signals...
which is great if you're a hacker looking to tap and trace a call made by a specific cellphone number.
Larry. What's the good word?
here we go. - Okay.
future deadee's name is albert machado.
the guy works for the I. M. F.
for a few more hours, anyway.
okay. Bingo.
we got the network I. D.
okay.
what the hell?
he's bouncing the I. d. number and changing the call history?
Fi, I've never seen that.
okay, let's go. Let's go. Go.
I got to cover my tracks.
Oh, well. Time to go.
come on, kid. We'll take the service elevator.
I want you to tell me, counselor
who is first chair on this case?
sir, the judge asked you a question.
you hesitated.
Yeah, because I was looking for my notes which someone left on my desk back in the office!
excuse me!
I'm gonna need to see some I. D.
I. D.
Oh, you want to see some I. D.
he wants to know who I am.
do you want to tell him who I am?
managing partner -- nickerson, trott and associates.
$100 million annual billing and first chair --No, look, look, look!
there has been a disturbance on this floor.
I'm gonna need you to head downstairs right now.
okay. Okay. All right. Sorry.
you didn't answer my question.
you're the boss, larry.
Ah, damn right!
here you go.
to albert machado.
the first of 46 moneymaking opportunities On that list of mine.
to albert.
may his life be short and end screaming.
I'm kidding.
you got to lighten up and enjoy yourself.
I mean, this guy is your enemy.
enemy or not, we're planning an execution.
I'm sorry if I'm not doing cartwheels.
this is machado, inside and out -
from his home address to his favorite brand of toothpaste.
you two have got some scouting to do.
I've got to finalize the arrangements for who we're framing for his murder.
you never said anything about framing somebody.
that's news to me, too.
well, it doesn't concern you two.
I'm taking care of it.
actually, it does concern us.
to sell a frame-up, there's a lot of details
you're gonna want us to get right.
it's called compartmentalization.
we each have our own unique and very specific set of responsibilities.
I handle the details.
you two point and shoot.
you want us to start shooting, you need to start sharing.
okay, fine...
but only because I'm particularly proud of this.
we're framing a Filipino separatist group.
points for originality, no?
if we're framing them for murder, Why not frame them for abduction?
Oh, kid. Don't start that boy-scout crap.
this is not you.
the man is part of a organization that destroyed my life, larry.
I don't care if he attends Another one of his daughter's dance recitals.
but this is a better investment.
if you kill him, then he's dead.
that's usually how it goes.
but if you grab him,
then you can interrogate him, ransom him.
the sky's the limit.
well, I don't mind raising the bottom line.
what do you think, wall street?
all right, westen. We'll try it.
who doesn't love a good kidnapping?
I'll make some calls.
do you want to - - Oh, uh, and one more thing.
I'm sure it's occurred to you to try and have someone tail me back to the list.
if I pick up even the slightest hint of the vaguest whiff
that I've got a tail...
I'm dropping vaughn and his entire organization on your head.
that guy.
he's kind of a dick.
Uh,FI, you do remember that we're looking for someone
who deals in top-of-the-line phone scramblers, right?
top of the top of the line, actually.
okay, so you're saying one of the wizards in there
sold brennen the equipment that beat us back at the courthouse?
the place is a dump.
well, they're not into interior design.
the guy in the gray shirt -- that's alfredo.
that guy.
he doesn't look like he could complete a 411 call, Let alone direct us to brennen.
two independent and highly motivated sources Say alfredo's the only guy in Miami
who's moving black-market technology of this caliber.
well, I tell you, there's no way we're getting
through that front door fast enough to get the jump on him.
who says we're using the door?
Hey, hey.
of the many ways to launch a sneak attack, few are more disorienting and terrifying for your enemy than dropping in from above.
it gives you immediate and overwhelming superiority.
the only downside?
sometimes it means an 8-foot fall to the floor.
Oh, geez.
I know your sign says "closed..."
but can we talk for a minute?
start talking or start losing limbs.
listen! Just listen!
all I did was sell that guy a scrambler for his phone A-and a wall safe.
what kind of safe did you sell him?
it's an xl-500 series.
that doesn't really mean anything to us.
it's cutting-edge.
heat-resistant up to 2, 000 degrees.
biometric lock.
wait. You mean with a hand scanner?
exactly.
I gave him a good deal on it, too.
free delivery and installation.
well, if you installed it, you have his address.
I can't give you that.
that guy -- I-I think he's planning on killing me.
I-I'm locking my door 24/7.
well, since we already made it past your locked door
I think you have more immediate problems.
address. Now.
I'm calling jesse.
we need all hands on deck.
all right. So, what's your plan?
too early to say for sure.
I can't even tell how many guards there are on the property.
not what I meant.
I can see the wheels turning, kid.
are you gonna drop a bug on him?
pin a tail on the donkey?
come on -- how are you gonna steal the list from brennen?
share.
why don't you tell me how you're gonna play it?
teach me something.
Oh, you say that like I didn't teach you damn near everything else you know.
fair enough. I'll tell you what I see, larry.
I see you making him comfortable...
gaming him, keeping him out in the open.
the last thing you want
is brennen scurrying down some hole with the list
so we're both keeping him very comfortable
until an opportunity presents itself, right?
right. - Yeah.
show time.
there's our target.
what?
for kidnapping.
Albert Machiado Dirty IMF official
part of the organization That burned Michael
he didn't spare any expense on his security.
those bodyguards.
they got ranger tats.
probably former special forces.
maybe we should just clip one or two of them, See how special they really are.
Hey, you wanted to know when machado got here.
he just got here.
we'll be there.
Yeah, he wants to meet, wants to hear our plan.
so remember -- very comfortable.
the entire compound is surrounded
by an 8-foot wrought-iron and concrete fence.
it's patrolled by at least seven armed guards.
a large explosion right here by the front gate
will draw attention in the wrong direction,
allow us to sneak in through the rear wall.
what about these, uh, ugly little boxes.
are they supposed to be motion sensors, video cameras.
Oh, they're both, but we're gonna knock out the compound's power.
and they'll be running blind until the generator starts up.
from the moment we breach, We'll have two minutes to locate machado, grab him,
and get him out before the power comes back up.
it's gonna be tight, but I got to say, fellas, I love the simplicity.
make them look left, stab them in the eyes, Go in right.
it's like a magic trick.
Yeah, like one of those really bloody magic tricks.
Yeah, I'd prefer not to be the one bleeding.
seven guards is a lot of moving parts to account for.
and we can't exactly extract machado if we're dead.
the kid thinks we need to watch some guard shift changes
to find the best time to breach,
minimize our chances of being seen.
really.
how long do you think we need to watch these shift changes.
I'm thinking one, maybe two days.
Yeah. Yeah. I can see that.
you want one or two days to scout.
Yeah.
which would also conveniently give you one or two days to try and come up with a plan To wriggle out from under my thumb.
that about the shape of it, westen.
Brennen, I- - wait.
how about this instead.
why don't both you ladies put on your game faces...
right now.
because you're going in.
right now.
peanut butter. Jelly.
now make me a sandwich delicious enough to blast into that compound
and frame a filipino separatist organization For the kidnapping of albert machado.
going now is a mistake.
we haven't taken the time we need to prep.
well, what do you think larry's doing.
window-shopping. 4
he's at the compound, finishing your recon.
look, I know you're not exactly worried about our well-being.
I resent that.
safety is my number-one priority, which is why...
I got you these.
don't flash those adorable puppy-dog eyes at me.
what happened to that plan I liked so much.
if you want us around for a second operation,
I'm telling you to reconsider.
and I'm telling you...
two elite operatives like yourselves -- you'll be fine.
and you can take solace in the fact that you don't have a choice.
Oh, don't tell me the kid's still moping around.
every moment since you left.
what do you got.
okay, the main power for machado's compound
is run off a transformer a quarter-mile north.
that's perfect.
you can drop a charge off there on your way to the breach.
Yeah, now, machado is in his office right now at the back of the main house.
if we can separate him from his guards and then force him outside, snatching him shouldn't be any problem.
love it.
now, before you go in, You got to make these bombs exactly like this.
exactly.
do not deviate.
I know you want to frame some guys in manila, But I don't read tagalog.
I'm sorry.
I-I believe that's filed under "your problem." good luck in there.
call me when it's time to send the bill.
so... You ready to make some fireworks.
if you're looking to frame a specific group for a bombing, you use their design plans, their construction materials, and their particular brand of c-4.
bomb experts know that not all c-4 is the same.
the same taggant chemicals that allow manufacturers to identify their own product will also allow forensic teams to track down the source country to determine who's to blame
just like checking the label on a t-shirt to determine where it's made, only a little more complicated.
okay, so, what --There's no opening the safe without brennen.
well, with enough time, we could cut our way in,
but there'd be no way to hide our handiwork.
brennen would find out.
right, and once he does, vaughn knows we got the list,
and we'd have a war on our hands.
I say to hell with this.
I say we let brennen find out, stick a gun in his mouth,
tell him we're gonna decorate the walls with his big-ass brain If he doesn't hand over mike's debrief.
problem solved.
I like where your head is at.
but we don't know where brennen is.
right, and if we go looking for him,
we better make sure he doesn't see our shadow,
cause he warned mike about the consequences of following him.
okay, so we go invisible.
we break the safe, wait for him to show up.
when he does, you know, my "gun in the mouth" pitch.
anybody got a better idea.
when a real-estate bubble bursts, it's tough on the civilian population.
but it's a field day for spies.
empty buildings provide excellent cover for scouting in an urban environment.
and it's always nice to plan and execute illicit operations in air-conditioned comfort.
unfortunately, all that unoccupied space is a playground for criminals, too.
10th floor. Southwest corner unit.
that's the condo where brennen installed the safe.
clever bastard hid the thing in an empty building.
looks like he's turning it into a television studio.
I've never seen more cameras in my life.
Yeah, we can forget about being invisible.
if we go in there, he's gonna know it.
these shape charges are almost set.
you good.
Yeah, bombs on the front gate and transformer Are on one frequency.
and this little piggy's on the other.
two clicks, three booms.
a bomb built to distract is long on fuel and short on shrapnel.
the larger the fireball, the more eyeballs it attracts.
Hey, you want to stretch.
this is gonna be a two-minute sprint.
a bomb built to breach a wall, on the other hand, need not be particularly loud or visible.
charges shaped to direct force into structural supports can blow a hole in a wall without blowing out anyone's eardrum.
Mike, you go around the other side.
I'll flush machado out into your waiting arms, okay.
Oh, mike, there are no bonus points for being gentle.
Hey.
great to hear from you.
what the hell is happening over there.
I'm kind of in the middle of a breach, sam.
and you got to call now.
it's the only time I could get away from larry.
tell me some good news.
we got something.
we found out where brennen is keeping that list.
1488 brickell avenue, apartment 1037.
we got eyes on it right now.
that is great news.
Yeah, but this isn't --He's got the thing in a safe with a biometric lock,
and the thing is covered by about a jillion security cameras.
you want us to crash the place.
no, even if we get the list, We got to stop brennen from sending that file to vaughn.
I think larry might be able to help with that.
I got to go.
hands. Hands.
weapon.
do you have any idea who I am.
Yes, I do.
who I work for.
Yes, I do.
does the name "michael westen" ring any bells.
kid.
Larry, what are you doing.
Adios.
what are you doing.
mission accomplished.
come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
what the hell was that, larry.
God, you never feel more alive than after you've killed somebody.
you were supposed to grab machado.
grab. - Oh, god. You saw his file.
the world's a better place without him. - We had a deal.
whoa, well, what can Ii say.
I crossed my fingers behind my back.
what are you gonna do about it.
Jesus, every time I come back here, There is less of you in there.
you're bottling up all your darkness, a-all the rage,
all the good stuff that makes you who you are.
that son of a bitch --He helped burn you.
he deserved to die.
are you gonna tell me different.
there it is.
there's the look.
they took your life away.
I know what you want to do.
give yourself permission.
what makes you think I won't start with you.
because you're lost.
and because I am the way back.
and deep down...
you know that.
no kids. No families.
done.
and I won't work with brennen.
brennen is a necessary evil.
for now, he's got the list.
for the moment.
he has it stashed in a safe with a biometric lock.
Sam and fi found it earlier today.
that is beautiful.
that is so beautiful.
that is beautiful.
I knew you were working an angle.
if we're gonna do this, I can't have a noose around my neck.
the audio file brennen has
we need to get it before we go after the list.
I love it.
I'll call him right now.
there they are.
a good general knows His army is only as effective as its weakest soldier.
and a great general has no weak soldiers in his army.
to a beautiful partnership.
Where's machado.
did he put up much of a fight.
is he still usable.
you know, kid, I been thinking a lot about what you said.
but I got a much easier way to do it.
Larry, what the hell are you doing.
Yes, larry. What the hell are you doing.
you know the interesting thing about a biometric lock.
son of a bitch.
that the owner can still open it even after he's dead.
Larry, don't. - Stay back, michael.
you told me everything I wanted to hear,
which makes me think I can't trust you, not yet.
you don't know where the list is.
that is true.
but the kid does.
he found out earlier today.
you know what your problem is, brennen.
other than this knife in your chest.
is you are so busy thinking 10 moves ahead,
you don't see the movements right in front of you.
I knew that michael would take care of all the hard stuff
and leave me to focus on the fun stuff.
you didn't beat me, michael.
no.
I did.
sorry, kid.
I revised your plan.
Larry, what the hell are you doing.
now there's nothing stopping vaughn from coming after me.
I was counting on that.
you're locked in now.
you need me to survive.
you're gonna have some awfully big predators stalking you,
but you'll be fine if you stick with me.
Hey, it's time for the little baby bird to come back to the nest...
only this time, he's flying solo.
call your friends.
right now.
Sam and FI -- they're going away.
or...
Sam and fi...
are going...away.
Michael, where are you. What happened.
Larry and I are going into business together.
so he'll help us with brennen.
no. That's irrelevant now.
I need you, sam, and jesse to take my mom and get out of town.
take everything you need for a long trip.
Michael, Call you in a few weeks, honey.
now you, me...
and big mouth's body here
we're gonna go for a little ride.
honey. sam, he called me honey.
son of a bitch.
why. W-what does that mean.
"honey" is a distress signal we used to use in belfast.
when I asked about brennen, he said it was irrelevant.
I think brennen's dead.
which means vaughn's gonna be booking a flight down to miami
pretty soon to put bullets in all of us.
michael said to get out of town and take what we need.
well, that's just got to be larry trying to get mike alone.
or it's mike telling us to get the list.
maybe, but we can't be sure that's what he means.
well, a hunch is as good as we're gonna get.
come on, kid, it's the natural evolution of your plan.
you said yourself you didn't want to work with brennen.
this wasn't what I meant, larry.
well, look at the bright side.
now it's just you and me.
actually, it's just you and me and vaughn
and a hundred of his closest friends.
once we get the list, we can just start tearing away
at the foundation of vaughn's empire Brick by bric...
until there's no one left to send. Okay.
you know, it's a shame we got to lug this guy around,
when all we need is his hand.
geez, I would kill for a bone saw.
Oh, that son of a bitch.
put it in a cinder-block wall.
every second counts.
safe technology has been revolutionized in the past 30 years.
new metal alloys are stronger and more resistant than ever to drills, saws, and even explosive compounds.
walls, on the other hand, haven't really changed much since the middle ages.
so if you can't get into a safe fast enough, you can always pull it out of the wall and take it with you.
home sweet home.
let's go find something to put our host in.
just stop moping, kid, will you.
what's done is done.
once you get your head wrapped around all this,
I know you -- you're gonna love it.
you ready.
time for brennen's swan song.
what the hell happened in here.
where is the safe.
what did you do.
where is the damn safe.
Larry, calm down. I don't know.
I've been with you this whole time, remember.
you stop being cute and you tell me now.
Oh, you got something on your...
I mean, it's -- now it's...
you -- you got something there.
who is this.
Hello, larry.
it's your favorite wet rag, sam axe, calling.
is this you, too. - It is.
now put me on speakerphone, jerk.
I'm sorry.
I don't take orders from pathetic, old
the next one makes you dead...
and me smile.
and I want to smile, larry.
I really, really want to smile.
okay, so, here's what's gonna happen.
Mike's gonna walk out of that room right now,
and you're gonna sit there like a good little boy and wait for the cops.
otherwise you're gonna join brennen in the afterlife.
believe that, larry.
I wish I could say it's been fun, larry.
no.
you move, I shoot you right in the head.
come on, larry.
you and I both know you're not gonna shoot me.
try me.
you won't reach the door.
Yes, I will.
I'm gonna walk right out that door.
I'll do it, michael. I'll do it.
and you know why.
I can't stand watching you...
waste who you are...
what you have inside...
what we could have been.
you're not gonna do it, larry.
because if you shoot me, sam will kill you where you stand.
and while I'd give my life for something I believe in,
there's not a thing in this world that you'd die for.
and you want to know the difference between you and me.
I really do know you.
you only think you know me.
you think we'll ever see this place again.
I don't know.
once we have the list from brennen's safe,
we'll turn it over to the government.
they'll have to help us with vaughn.
and what happens after that.
one thing at a time, fi.
everything okay, fi.
we used to talk about where we were going, What we wanted our lives to be.
and now the only time we talk about our future is when someone's coming to end it.
we're almost there.
you said that 10 minutes ago.
Hey.
doing any better.
not really, no.
Marv and I were pretty close, you know.
just can't shake the feeling that I made a mistake not calling his family.
well.
you can let yourself off the hook, cause...
I did it for you.
what are you talking about.
I got marv's number off your phone, And I called his house.
his daughter, emily, picked up.
I couldn't say much,
but I told her that her dad had died a hero.
Maddy, I --Thank you.
you're welcome.
but I didn't do it for you.
if I've learned anything from watching you and my son,
it's if one little lie helps a family sleep easy at night, Then, well, I say that's not such a bad thing.
right.
we're in.
all that work for one little thumb drive.
try to hold onto it this time.
we got four hours until vaughn gets that tape.
I wonder how he'll take it when he hears you running down everything you know About him and his underlings to a federal agent.
his organization has never faced this kind of exposure before.
I imagine he'll marshal all of his forces And send them this way.
so, the gates of hell will open...
the apocalypse will be upon us...
and everyone we know and love
will be in danger of becoming very dead.
so what else is new.
everybody should try to get some sleep.
tomorrow will be a long day.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...Family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
in the world of intelligence, taking down an entire covert network is the ultimate challenge.
it's not something you can do alone.
you. - Welcome back.
you need the resources of an entire intelligence agency behind you.
you need solid intelligence that can point you in the right direction.
that list is the key to destroying the people who burned me.
but that's just a starting point.
you're not after an individual person -- you're after dozens of people, all of them hiding, all of them with resources and skills, all of them fighting you by any means necessary.
it's a gigantic jigsaw puzzle of information that requires months of research and analysis where one target leads to the next.
a courier picked up off the suburban street leads to a spy hiding out as a diplomat in a foreign embassy leads to a hardened group of armed assassins in another place entirely.
sometimes it's a surgical operation done with discrete teams that no one ever hears about.
other times, it's all-out war.
but one thing is always the same
with each piece of the puzzle, you find you understand your enemy more clearly.
you penetrate the secrecy that shields the people behind the scenes...
...Working your way to the top of the network to the people pulling the strings.
you keep fighting, trying to put that last piece of the puzzle in place...
...trying to find that last person who will give you the answers you're looking for.
glad you made it.
I was beginning to wish I'd brought a magazine.
there was a guard change at the front entrance.
isn't knowing that supposed to be your job as senior field officer?
Max CIA OFFICER
handling that kind of your job as an operative extraordinaire?
Oh, but that's not my title.
until my burn notice is officially lifted, I'm just a "civilian intelligence asset.
michael CIA ASSET " Just saying, the way the boss talks about you,
I'd think handling a few government security guards would be a piece of cake.
I think he's got a crush on you.
I can hear you guys, you know. Your mikes are live.
Raines THE BOSS
just busting your chops, boss. I'm here with your favorite toy.
I get jealous sometimes.
we're supposed to be wheels up at the airport in an hour.
stop screwing around and get in there.
Roger that.
he sounds grumpy.
you'd be grumpy, too, if you had a beard that looked that bad.
you want to do the honors, superstar?
rfid security is easy to get around with a device known in the trade as a "gecko.
complicated electronics, but a simple principle
any key can be copied, even a digital one.
Hey, I'll be out of here in a sec.
just finishing up a software update.
you know, nowadays, those updates are done remotely.
you don't have to hard-line into the mainframe.
unless, of course, you're trying to steal data.
game over, Hector. You're coming with us.
listen, this is some sort of mistake.
come on, Hector. We can do this the easy way or the way that involves an ambulance.
my name is Tim, all right?
not Hector. - Tim Sayers?
no. That's the name on the I. T. badge you stole.
you're Hector Oaks.
I guess after you bombed the embassy in Albania, you lost the glasses and bleached your hair.
it's working for him. I like it.
Yeah. Me too.
guys, seriously -some sort of mistake.
I'll prove it to you. I've got my license right here.
they never choose the easy way.
Hello, security?
Yes, there's a man down on the 9th floor. He's hurt, and I think he's unconscious.
let's move, fellas.
we'll meet you at the northwest service exit.
we got to hustle before a real ambulance shows up.
let's move!
plane ticket, one-off I. D. You head home at 2200 hours.
really good to have you back.
no, I want in on this.
you know as well as I do this isn't just another interrogation.
slow down.
let us question him -- he could know where the operations chief is.
and if he does -- Hey!
we'll keep you in the loop.
make sure you do.
I've waited a long time for this.
I know, Michael. You want answers.
no, Raines.
I need answers.
one of the most dangerous times for a spy is right after a job.
your guard is down, which makes it a good time for an attack by your enemies.
or, in some cases...
your friends.
Fiona. Uh, Fiona.
Fiona, don't you think we'd be more comfortable on the bed?
what makes you think... That I care... If you're comfortable?
how was the job?
the job was good.
I missed you.
Yeah, I...got that.
I think you broke a rib.
so where were you this time?
right. Right, right, right.
you can't say.
secret spy stuff.
don't you find it somewhat ironic that for years, we've been dealing with this little conspiracy?
I think a memo called it an "Unauthorized quasi-governmental agency.
my point is, we fought the people who burned you for a long time, Michael.
now they're on the run, the CIA hunting the bastards down, and we're just out.
I wish I could tell you, Fi. I really do.
it's been six months now.
mysterious trips around the world with Max.
it just doesn't seem fair that he should get to have all the fun.
I mean, he's, what, your keeper or whatever?
he's my agency contact.
it had to be someone, Fi.
the CIA wasn't just gonna let me got out there alone.
when you got burned... It wasn't just you.
these last four years have been hard on all of us.
I know. I know, and I'm really sorry about that.
but we are so close to wrapping this up.
and then I can move on.
I hope you find what you're looking for, Michael.
I really do.
then we can all move on.
Hey, mom. - Look who's here.
the world traveler returns. Hi, baby.
Sam called. He said he had something to show me here.
Yeah, he does.
Sam! Michael's here!
mom, every time I come over here these days, you've changed something else.
Yeah, well, I thought you're starting a new life, so I'd make a few changes myself.
Hey, Mikey! Speaking of changes, look at you.
Yeah.
back in my fighting shape.
and by fighting shape, of course I mean -- We know, we know.
the ladies love it.
what can I say?
you know, I think I was stress eating before, so I dropped a few pounds since you nailed these guys.
please tell me the cleanup is going well.
Mike, come on. I had security clearance back in the day, too.
it's going well.
we're making progress.
progress is good.
okay, hey. Come on back. I got a surprise for you.
okay, Mikey, three guesses what it is.
is it -is it my car?
give the man a prize.
now, the, uh, roof looks kind of like a tin can mauled by a grizzly bear, but the power train and the engine are still ticking, so I think it's salvageable.
nothing says "Welcome home" like 4, 000 pounds of mangled steel, right?
I wanted to take the tarp off.
Sam wanted to let you do it yourself.
you know, more of a dramatic unveiling.
what are you doing here?
shouldn't you be in CIFA in D. C?
I thought you told him.
you didn't tell him? I thought you told him.
I didn't have time. I just saw him.
I was, but now I'm, um... Now I'm not.
I quit. - You quit?!
I quit. You know what it is?
after everything I went through with you guys, helping all those people,
I just -- I can't do the government thing anymore, man.
it's too much red tape.
I just -- it's harder than you think, going back. You'll see.
he's got a fancy job with a private security firm down here.
big money.
well, the money's all right. It's not bad.
actually helped me get this bad boy out of impound, so
Uh...Thanks.
Sam said the car had some sentimental value, said it belonged to your dad.
um, please tell me that you want the car, cause it was actually a huge pain in my ass to get it here.
this...Is great.
things are heating up at work, so don't expect any more favors.
enjoy this one.
well, aren't you gonna unwrap it?
I should take this.
is that the batphone?
Yeah. - Yeah, duty calls.
Hello? - It's Max.
we need you to get up to D. C. pronto.
D. C? I just got back to Miami yesterday.
well, hop on a plane, buddy.
Raines decided we need a little help on this interrogation.
see you soon.
one of the things you give up in intelligence is control over your own schedule.
it's a little like being a doctor on call, only your emergencies tend to be thousands of miles away.
so what's the problem?
the problem is he's not talking.
only one of these bastards is left in the wild, and Hector there still won't give him up.
anything new in here?
no.
the name "John Kessler" and a blurry photo.
hard to believe he managed to assemble so many operations and stay so off-the-radar, but he pulled it off.
the last one.
Yeah. We get him, we get everything
not the mealy-mouthed "I followed orders" B. S.
we got from all the other guys.
Kessler got his hands dirty on every spy they burned, every op they pulled -all of it.
but first, we got to find him.
and to do that, we need to get our friend Hector, there, talking.
what do you want me to do?
just be the same unstoppable son of a bitch I recruited all those years ago.
do what you have to do.
listen, buddy, I warned you.
I gave you plenty of chances to talk.
you're leaving us with no other choice but to move on to other options, options that you're not gonna like.
what's that supposed to mean?
it means if you're not gonna talk to me, you get to talk to Michael Westen.
he doesn't get a government paycheck.
he doesn't play by our rules.
knock yourself out, Michael.
nobody's watching.
the biggest obstacle you can face in an interrogation is yourself
when your own feelings, your own anger, your own desire for revenge are all that stand between you and the information you want.
the stronger your feelings are, the hotter your hate burns, the more important it is to set it aside.
do you know why they sent me in here?
Yeah. Got a pretty good idea.
they dismantled the main camera, but they usually have an extra one around here.
let's have a look.
there we go.
now we can have some real privacy.
what are you gonna do? You gonna torture me? It doesn't matter.
I'm not -I'm not gonna -- I'm not -I'm not -- calm down, calm down.
I'm not gonna hit you.
I just want to have a conversation.
I'm not gonna say anything.
okay, then I'll talk.
you know, I've learned a lot about your organization over the last four years.
and the thing is, the more I tried to dismantle it, the more I realized it was just people.
not some abstract thing -- just people trying to get work done in a dangerous world, and having a few burned spies around could make that possible.
and the thing is, I get it.
I mean, plenty of us have had that dream...
an operations group that didn't have to adhere to government bureaucracy, that could just act without rules, without red tape.
and you made that happen.
do I support what it turned into? No.
but I'd be lying if I said I didn't understand that dream, Hector.
I don't blame you.
even when you pulled that knife on me, I knew you were just a guy trying to survive.
but the thing is, these guys, they don't understand that.
to them, you're just member number 31 in a criminal conspiracy they need to dismantle.
it doesn't have to be that way.
but you have to help me.
tell me where Kessler is.
I can't. You don't understand.
he'll kill my family.
not if I get to him first.
how do you think he's avoided you so long?
he'll see you coming.
he didn't see me coming when I took down his entire organization.
you want to protect your family? I'm your best bet.
you think you can take him?
well, let me put it this way -- he was the head of operations.
he planned every project that made my life hell for the last four years.
I'd like to put those years behind me, but I have a few questions, questions only he can answer.
so trust me.
I want to talk to him more than you can possibly imagine.
just tell me what you know.
what the hell did you do to the camera in there?
we've been deaf and blind out here for an hour.
it's in the trash can. I disabled it.
I don't need to remind you -- I went out on hell of a limb bringing you back in.
Kessler's in Caracas.
he's got a compound there.
you want the address?
what? How -You said to do what I had to do.
I did what I had to do.
you said he was good.
what else? Did you get details?
Kessler's dug in.
we're gonna need a team.
Oh, and one more thing -I want to bring my people.
your people? What people?
you mean that ex-S. E.A. L. and your girlfriend?
Yes, the ex-S. E.A. L. and my girlfriend.
I can't have people without clearance
Sam and Fi knew the classified intel on this op before you did.
they're two more pairs of boots on the ground in a country that's not too friendly with the CIA right now.
Max will have his team there. If you want my help, I want my team.
you know, I forgot what a pain in the ass you could be, Westen.
Yeah, but I'm worth it.
intelligence agencies choose their foreign command centers with a few things in mind.
you want a place that's near main roads but not on them.
it's best if the owner is on the payroll, or is controllable in some other way.
you want power for the computers, air-conditioning for the meetings, and a generous late checkout policy in case an operation goes wrong.
Hey, guys. Welcome to Caracas. How was the flight?
which one? - It would have been better if we hadn't been routed through Turkey.
and Spain. And Costa Rica.
and if they had peanuts.
well, you know how these jobs are.
they got to bounce you around a little bit to throw the dogs off the scent.
come on. Let's get inside.
okay, so, this is what our taxpayer dollars get us, huh?
it's low-key, and it's got a great view of the street.
if you got a couple of bolivares, the bed vibrates.
used to be the honeymoon suite.
well, in this room, I'd ask for an annulment.
well, you don't have to stay in here. You're staying in room 505.
it's been swept by counter-intel, but try to keep the shop talk down to a minimum.
and don't drink the water.
I got two guys on jello and antibiotics so far.
w-we're all staying in the same room?
Yeah.
you really know how to show a girl a good time.
well, don't blame him.
we don't have the resources to secure the whole building.
Hey, have, uh -have a little something from the mini-bar on Uncle Sam as my way of saying "I'm sorry.
apology accepted.
you two get settled in.
Mike and I, we're gonna over the details.
well, wait.
we don't -we don't need to go over the details, too?
uh, Fiona, just give us a minute.
is, uh -is that gonna be a problem?
it'll be fine.
I'm sorry.
I know they're part of the team.
just regulations are regulations. - What are we looking at?
Kessler's compound.
right where Hector said it would be.
can we get in?
well, we could, but we'd never get out.
alarm's wired directly to the central police station.
we raid the place, there's gonna be a huge fire fight.
we'd never extract our team before the Venezuelans arrived.
hit him on the road.
unfortunately, Kessler doesn't travel that much.
and when he does, he sticks to places with as much security as he has at home.
he drives an armored S. U.V. too.
and there's no way I can get an okay to hit him with anything that's big enough to make a dent.
so, that leaves us with what?
well, you, my friend.
meet commandant Armando Puente.
he runs a military checkpoint that Kessler travels through regularly.
he was trained in Cuba by the Soviets during the late '80s.
since your Russian's better than mine...
I'm gonna make a new comrade.
technically, "Vasily Andropov" gets to make a new comrade and then convince that comrade to look the other way when our team goes in.
study up, Vasily.
there's a full legend in the file.
this is a surgical strike, Michael.
if anything goes wrong, we're gonna have a major international incident on our hands.
and if you end up in a Venezuelan prison... - Yeah, yeah.
it's gonna be tough to do a prisoner swap for a spy who's still officially burned.
I get it. I can handle it.
talk to your team, get cleaned up.
you scout the checkpoint at 1400 hours.
Oh, sightseeing is so much more fun with a machete and scouting a military checkpoint.
maybe your CIA buddies could throw in a hotel and some flight upgrades.
I could get used to a vacation like that.
I'm glad you're enjoying it.
well, that makes one of us.
how long is this gonna take, Mikey?
I got a half a bottle of Tequila waiting for me back at the hotel.
what? They said not to drink the water.
Ooh, it looks nasty.
what are you doing here, exactly?
offering a bribe to him in the officer's uniform.
all right, I'm gonna need a little private time with him.
give me about 10 minutes?
Yeah, I think Chuck Finley and his wife can handle that.
what do you think, Darlene?
actually, you're Tara and Greg Winter.
Max already backstopped you with passports, licenses, baggage-claim stubs.
Yeah, yeah. Everything except the monogrammed socks. Great.
the Winters are gonna have some car trouble at the checkpoint.
okay, so you need us to rig a car.
Max already did that.
Oh, I see, so it's probably one of these fancy-shmancy pre-rigged things, totally state-of-the-art.
top secret.
completely undetectable.
Yeah, I could have done that with some olive oil on the engine block.
well, I guess that's the world of the big leagues.
okay, come one. Let's get this done.
when you're working under a cover I. D. overseas, it's all about the little things.
the farther you are from home, the higher the stakes.
that's why you study.
you have to know every visa on your passport, every detail on every document, the entire history of the person you're claiming to be.
it's true whether you're pretending to be a Russian spy on a foreign recruitment mission or a clueless American tourist with a bad rental car.
well, I certainly didn't rent the damn thing.
well, what do you want me to say?
I'm sorry. I mean, we're here in Venezuela.
it's not like there's a lot of choice of rental cars here.
sir.
huh? Yes, sir?
excuse me, Sir. Can you move it?
I would love to, okay?
I'm trying to start it.
but as you can see, the car is en fuego.
it's on fire.
that's not my problem.
I hope that means you're gonna get a mechanic.
cause otherwise -I'm sorry, Sir.
here we go.
I'm gonna fix it 'cause you certainly don't know what you're doing.
Oh, boy. Yeah, you really nailed it there.
sir, do me a favor.
sir, give us a break, please.
well, help us.
help us.
do me a favor. It's out of order.
we need help.
what? Pepe.
when you're recruiting an asset from a hostile country, you pose as a citizen of one of your target's allies.
someone who would never help the United States, for example...
...Might be perfectly happy to help a Russian.
it's been a long time since I spoke Russian last time
I forgot all my Russian. Can you speak Spanish?
Spanish?
can speak English.
fine.
now, why are you here?
for this man.
mr Kessler.
he drives through here, always with armed guards.
he is...American.
what do you want with him?
this man has committed many crimes in my country, terrible crimes.
Mr. Kessler is well-connected.
he has friends in government, he has money.
that is why I come to you, comrade.
other men get rich off this criminal, but you, you serve this country.
this man is very dangerous.
you would be doing a great service to your country and to my country.
all you have to do is bring him here alone, and my team will take care of the rest.
think about it, comrade.
I will be at this address this afternoon.
I hope to see you soon.
I will make it worth your while.
it's always a tense time right after you've made a pitch to recruit an asset on foreign soil.
if they accept, you're in business.
if they decline, you're in jail, which is why it's a good idea to have backup.
don't worry.
he's only a few minutes late. He'll be here.
well, when he does get here, quit talking in my ear.
if he hears you, I'm dead.
he's not gonna hear anything.
that radio's so far down your ear canal it's tickling your brain.
okay, Michael, Puente's here.
look Russian.
commander, you came. I was beginning to worry.
is there something wrong?
I spoke to a friend at FSB.
he said he has never heard of your operation.
who are you?
you pull a gun on me.
abort, abort! Get the extraction team ready.
alpha team getting into position.
wait, are you kidding? Michael's never gonna let you just pull him.
let him sell it.
what are you talking about?
we can't let him -- He can handle himself.
just give him what he needs.
alpha team, stand by.
find Puente's FSB contact. Now!
I will not ask you again.
who are you?
I told you. I am Vasily Andropov.
my friend said there is no such person at FSB!
calm down, calm down.
I will calm down!
when you tell me who you are.
then I am calling security forces, and you can explain yourself to them.
there are three FSB operatives specializing in Venezuela
Viktor Banin, Bogdan Egorov, and Gennady Yohzin.
magicians and mind readers often use a technique known as shot gunning...
I spoke with Banin yesterday.
uh, he told me this might happen.
...in which you determine what your target is thinking by throwing a bunch of information at them and reading their reactions.
I don't know Viktor Banin.
it's effective for spies, as well, but it's considerably harder to do with a gun pointed at you.
of course you don't know Banin.
I spoke with Gennady.
eh, it is their job to shoot your good friend Bogdan if this mission goes wrong.
all teams stand by.
how do you know Bogdan?
I am an FSB Agent.
I don't come to this mission without knowing who you are and who your friends are.
tell me this -why has not Bogdan heard of this operation?
Bogdan is an FSB analyst in Saint Petersburg.
he's a computer nerd.
uh, tech specialist in Latin-American studies.
here we go -disciplined for alcohol abuse.
the guy's a booze hound. He's an alcoholic, Mike.
what can I say? Maybe he was too drunk or too busy playing with his computers to notice the memo on his desk!
I am sure that when he is executed for ruining this operation, he will wish he was a little more attentive.
you have a decision to make, comrade.
you can shoot me, but then you will explain yourself to the FSB and to the police.
you can leave, and I will find someone else.
or you can help me with the American, you collect your fee, and you keep your mouth shut.
come on, Mike.
if I find you are lying, I will not hesitate to shoot you.
I would expect nothing less from a soldier.
let us drink.
Cheers.
all right, everybody, I'm gonna review this one time, so pay attention.
michael and I will be in the command van, here.
Kessler will approach the checkpoint, moving southbound.
when he gets to the checkpoint, we have an asset in place that will separate him from his security.
Michael, you want to go over those details?
I've arranged with the commander of the checkpoint to take Kessler into the outbuilding to view his documents while keeping his soldiers outside.
at this point, the extraction team will enter from the east using the forest as cover.
remember... You're supposed to be a Russian team, so speak Russian.
or keep your mouths shut.
from there, he goes to the transpo team, which puts him in a box and gets him on a plane.
documents has already created the paperwork.
are we clear?
all right, remember this guy Kessler, he ran his own covert ops for a long time.
he did it well.
he's not gonna be a pushover, so be ready for anything.
okay. Let's move out.
Yeah, hey, Mike, uh, can we talk to you for a second?
Sam, I don't have time.
well, I suggest you make time.
Max put Sam and me on bag-watching duty at the airport.
what's next, coffee detail?
fi... She's got a point, Mike.
I mean, you say we're part of the team, but we're definitely not part of the action.
you have been part of it, which is why you have to hang back now.
puente thinks you're American tourists with a bad rental car.
if he sees your faces again, he'll know we set him up.
well, look, we can stay out of sight and still be ready to back you up.
Sam, you know this is the way they do things.
different teams have different jobs, for operational security.
operational security"?
what happened to the way we do things?
it's their show, Fi.
it's our show, too, brother.
we should be able to see this through.
I mean, right is right.
all right, Michael, let's go. Bravo team's already moving out.
I got to go. I'm sorry. I'll see you back in Miami.
the challenge of a good large-scale field operation is to keep all parts coordinated while keeping them as separate as possible.
field units are separate from transportation units...
...with the command unit separate from both.
when things go right, they all work together as one big team.
okay, we've got the target moving.
it's all you, buddy.
extraction team, stand by.
Mr. Kessler, I need you to come inside for a second.
is there a problem?
there's no problem. Just some documents to sign.
please, come inside.
okay, everybody ready.
the problem with remote command centers is what happens when things go wrong.
what's going on, Max?
what the hell is happening?
anyone stuck in the command center is too far away to do anything about it.
damn it!
the radios are not working!
we've got no contact.
Kessler knew we were here.
we're blown.
Fi, not a good time.
are you seeing what I'm seeing?
wait. Where are you? - Red team, come in.
we're about 50 yards from the checkpoint.
Fi, you were supposed to be at the airport.
Yeah, well, we decided to stick around and watch the "experts" do their thing.
what's happening out there?
I'm not sure.
it looks like Kessler picked up on your radio frequencies and jammed them.
they must have had some kind of scanner in the car.
how many down?
the smoke is still clearing, but it's bad.
he's moving.
he's heading back to the compound.
I hope you have a plan "B.
I'm working on it, Fi.
Kessler's men took out the team before they could move in.
Sam and Fi are helping the survivors.
Sam and Fi? Sam and Fi are supposed to be -- They're helping with survivors!
Kessler's on his way to the compound.
we got less than 20 minutes to salvage this.
how the hell are we gonna salvage -Just get in the van!
there he goes. This is our last chance.
uh, what's going on here? Do we have a plan?
a plan? No. I got some tactical goals and a rough approach.
a rough approach?
Oh, well, that's terrific.
thank God we've got that.
because we don't have back-up, video feeds, or working communication.
welcome to my world.
you're sure you want to do this?
I am not letting this go.
this is our chance to get Kessler before we're swamped with security forces.
you want out, I'll slow down, but I am not stopping.
floor it! hand on
is this seriously how you do things?
when I have to.
how are you still alive?
good question.
I eat a lot of yogurt.
I think we're a little out-gunned here.
grenade.
make that a lot out-gunned.
if you cover me, I can flank him and take him out from the woods.
or you could just shoot him. That works, too.
let's get inside. We're gonna have every cop and soldier in Caracas here in a minute.
keep your head down.
Oh, I think we lost him.
I don't think we lost him.
I think he doubled back.
or we're both wrong.
No! Don't shoot. I want him alive.
steel door.
Ugh, a safe room?
something like that.
the walls are metal.
all right, unless you have a thermal Lance, I'm calling this one.
no. I'm not leaving here with the job undone.
this is not about your personal revenge, Michael.
we'll can get him another time.
how?
you don't know anything about him.
he compromised a secure CIA communications system.
what do you think you're gonna do, just grab him at the airport?
Fi, you guys all right?
as well as could be expected.
the team is pulling out with their wounded now.
I need you to buy us a little time.
slow the cops down.
do you know the choke-point on the road near the bridge?
all traffic going to Kessler's has got to pass through there.
and you want us to stop them?
consider it done.
I don't know what you think buying us a few extra minutes is gonna do.
it would take us hours to get through that with the right tools, and we don't have anything.
Kessler's men have grenades.
we do this right, we can make a hole.
old-school.
I like that. I got them.
the most vulnerable system in any reinforced structure is typically ventilation.
holes that let in air can also let in other things, like the explosive cores of concussion grenades, for example.
they're a high-quality explosive and quite effective.
of course, you have to get them into place without blowing your hands off.
hurry it up, Sam. We've got about 30 seconds before police get here.
Yeah, well, you know what?
next time Tara and Greg Winter take a vacation, you get to soak the upholstery in gasoline.
well, first bullets, now fire.
so long, old girl.
so, you think the CIA's insurance plan covers that?
maybe. But I doubt it covers this.
last chance, Kessler!
as a spy, your job is intelligence.
you might want to back up away from the wall!
whether you're after national-security secrets or operational information about the people who destroyed your life, the job is the same.
we'll go in quick. He'll be stunned.
anything to get us out of here sooner, I'm all for.
do it.
there's no greater satisfaction than that moment when you finally get the answers you're looking for.
is he alive?
and nothing is harder to take than having those answers forever taken away.
he's dead.
I thought you said the blast wasn't enough to -- it wasn't the blast.
he shot himself.
well, I guess he didn't want to be taken alive.
well, it happens. We did our best.
that's it?
all this way?
after all these years?
that's it? That's it?!
Hey, listen! I'm sorry, man.
but if you want tidy endings and easy answers, you picked the wrong job.
he's gone.
and the police are here. We got to find a way out.
come on. Come on.
a well-trained police force knows that the first priority when arriving at a scene is to establish a perimeter and lock down the area.
you let them do that and, chances are, you're not getting out.
I think Kessler's gun had a spare clip.
we can hold them off for a little while, but...
we won't be able to shoot our way out.
at least not that way.
grab that fan.
I got an idea.
that's why it's important to make sure that they have a higher priority, like dealing with a more urgent threat.
if you've got enough ammunition and a good oscillating fan, you can keep them busy dealing with your gun...
...While you're busy getting away.
well, we made the papers.
not exactly the goal of this little operation, but it's something.
could be worse, I guess.
could be a picture of our corpses.
is my Spanish that bad or does this say, "The shootings are believed to be a part of a kidnapping attempt by a Colombian cartel?
Yeah. P.R. guys did a good job.
we got out clean. - Clean?
with two team members K. I.A. And a dead target?
I don't know what to tell you, Michael.
our job is to do the impossible.
we took Kessler out of the game.
Yeah, with help from a few pinch hitters.
you're never gonna hear it from the agency because officially you were never in Caracas, but thank you.
it would have been a lot worse without you.
unofficially, you're welcome.
anything for the cause.
so this is how it ends -a body on the ground.
Yeah, but he put a bullet in his own head and not yours.
Hey, I'll drink to that.
Mike, you won.
the people that burned you, the whole damn network -- it's done.
to new beginnings.
Mike, uh, you're kind of leaving us hanging, here.
I saw the door open.
what are you doing here?
I hope I didn't surprise you, mom.
I-I thought you were out.
no, I was just at my yoga class at the "Y."
glad to see you're taking care of yourself.
Oh, well. Baby steps.
which reminds me -- Sam said that you're on your way back to your old job.
something like that.
he also said that you didn't quite find what you were looking for in your trip down south.
I had a chance to finally get some answers, make sense of the last four years.
and that chance ended up in a body bag.
you know, all those years I lived with your father,
I used to think through millions of ways that I could confront him, everything that I wanted to say.
and all of a sudden, he drops dead.
that's it.
you know... People talk about "closure," but I don't buy it.
when somebody blasts a hole in your life... It tends to stay open.
it does, doesn't it?
so what do you do now?
now?
things go back to normal, I guess.
normal.
what exactly is normal?
I have no idea.
here's an idea.
why don't you fix the Charger?
this? Oh, no. No, no.
this is beyond saving.
nothing is beyond saving if you work at it.
nothing.
besides, then I could have my garage back.
want anything?
my name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until...
man: We got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls...
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
in any surveillance operation, you have to resist the impulse to grab your target and interrogate him immediately.
it may be tempting, particularly when your target was, say, involved in framing you for a murder.
of course, just because it's the right way to do things doesn't make it fun.
we've been here two days, Sam.
face it -- this guy is not calling the shots. He has Christmas lights hanging in July.
he may look a little bit like Michael, but there is no way he's capable of killing a CIA officerand setting Michael up for it.
Yeah, well, I don't think he's capable of setting a table.
yesterday, I found a brochureabout raising Alpacas for profit in his trash.
so let's scrap this cloak and daggerand go have a little chat.
I'm wearing my door-kicking Jimmy Choos.
Fi, you know the drill.
you want to find out who this guys works for, you hang back and watch.
what if he doesn't live through the day?
Oh, crap.
a sledgehammer and some guns. I don't think they're here to play bridge.
and you're smiling.
we get to do it my way.
no, we don't,cause we can't risk being exposed.
well, we have to do something.
Yes, what we have to do is orchestra Jacob's miraculous escape from the Mac-10 brigade.
all right. Head in. Let's make it peaceful.
I'll meet you both out back --unless a little war breaks out.
Fi...No war.- Fine. No war.
Mr. Pickles?
is that you, pal?
Hey, Jacob.- Wait, look, don't kill me, please!
Ah, don't you worry about a thing.
I'm not here to kill you.
they're here to kill you.- Wait a second. Who are you?
never mind. I'll explain later. You need to go out the back.
there's a tiny, little woman in a Hyundai who's gonna protect you.
Ah. Here we go. Hang on.
don't forget Mr. Pickles.
a-aren't you coming?- No, I'm gonna cover your escape.
so I need the keys to the truck in your garage and this hat.
Yeah, I-I --- No more talking. Time to go. Now.
Bye, Mr. Pickles.
as a spy, a lot of missions depend on the world not knowing you're there.
when an op involves saving someone's life and keeping your presence unknown, you have to make their escape look credible.
so if the person you're saving is an untrained civilian, you need to make it look likedlike an untrained civilian.
Hi. I'm Jacob. This guy broke into
honey, what just heard wasn't fireworks. Get in the damn car.
where have you been?
two-hour meeting with Pearce.
she's taking agents to Egyptto run down a lead she thinks she found.
good. That should give us a little breathing room.
I got your message.
this is my "I'm concerned we just kidnapped our only lead back to Max's killer" face.
well, be glad it's not your"Our only lead got murdered by a Latino gang" face.
a group of thugs was moving in to send cob to the morgue. We had to pull him out.
according to Jacob, he was doing some odd jobs for some mystery man who contacted him over the Internet.
and more recentlyhe was delivering unmarked packages in Overtown. I'm guessing drugs.
the gang thought he was dealing on their turfand tried to take him out.
whoever used Jacob to set you up is trying to get rid of him.
where is he now?
hiding. Upstairs.
what does he know about us?
well, I kept the details to a minimum but I explained that it's in his best interest and oursto find his boss.
something else you forget to mention?
he brought his doggie?
I really think I should run.
seriously, I-I can just grab my stuff.
jacob, listen. That is not an option.
know what? I think you're wrong. I think it's the only option.
well, running will work just fine...
until your boss catches you and kills you. We can help you.
you just have to tell us what you know about him.
I have no idea who he is.
h-he contacted me by e-mail about doing some odd jobs.
can -- I go now?- No, you can't.
are you in the habit of taking shady jobs that you find on the Internet?
I had no choice. Construction's dead. I needed cash.
how did this guy pay you?
he, uh, mailed me cash, then texted me the next gig.
the money was good. I didn't ask questions.
until a gang took a shot at you.
I'm in over my head here!
and I can't even go to the cops, because apparently,
I helped out on a murderand a bunch of drug deals.
your only way out of this is with us.
you need to help us get in touch with your boss.- I can't.
the phone he gave me to contact him with is at my house.
and I am not going back there.
Fi, I have this job with Sam.
Thanks, Fi.
Hey, Sam.- Mikey.
back to the old look, huh?
well, I figured since people are trying to kill me, it's not the worse idea to change my appearance a little.
can't argue with that logic.
you're drinking iced tea, Sam?
this job you have must be serious.
well, serious enough I got to keep a clear head.
my lady needs a favor.
she said she would do anything if I helped her.
anything, Mike. Do you have any idea what that means?
I don't need to. So, what's the favor?
well, Elsa was helping out this women's legal aid group. She met a gal, Denise O'Lear.
separated from her husband, custody problems with their son.
daddy was supposed to bring the kid back yesterday, but I guess he didn't show.
I'm not a family counselor, Sam.
no, but you were an Army Ranger, just like this guy's brother -- K. I.A. in Afghanistan.
Yeah. Apparently after.
uh, why don't I let her tell it. Hey, Denise. Over here.
Hi, Sam.- Hi.
so, uh, this is my buddy Mike, the guy I was telling you about.
we just got to the part about, uh, John's brother.
my husband was a good man, but he changed when he lost his brother.
after he quit job, he wanted to move out of the city, said he wanted to protect us. - So he has your son right now?
that's where come in, Mike.
just one quick chat to convince Johnto bring the kid back home.
we'll see what we can do.- Thank you.
when you see John, can you just go easy on him?
he's had such a hard time.
we're just gonna talk to him.
say, Sam?
Yeah, Mike.
why does it look like someonespent some time and money fortifying John's house?
because someone spent some time and money fortifying John's house.
this is feeling like more than a "One quick chat" kinda job.
Mike, don't be like that.
we're here. John's here. I'm sure it'll be fine.
fine? - Yeah.
and in the event that it isn't --ha ha -- I brought a tracker.
I'll just plant this on his truck in case he, you know, flees.
Mike, come on. What's the worst that could happen?
John could tell you to get lost, and we just talk to a lawyer.
spies deal with foreign agencies, dirty corporations, and criminal syndicates all the time, but none of them compares to dealing with families.
asking a man to take apart his business or turn on his country is easy compared to going into a man's home and telling him how to deal with the people he loves.
it's usually a good idea...
who are you?
to tell the truth.
my name's Michael. I'm a friend of your wife's.
Denise asked me come check on your son.
Tommy's fine.- Oh, I'm sure he is.
I promised Denise I'd come talk to you.
look, it is hot out here. Do you mind if I come inside to chat?
neither one of us wants to get the law involved here, do we?
fine. Come in.
keep your hands where I can see them.
so, where's Tommy?
it's none of your business.
you want to talk, you stay right where you are and talk.
John, you don't have to do that.- Hey, hey.
what, do you think you're clever?
turning to make yourself a smaller target, angling towards my off hand.
I said do not move.
who the hell are you? What, you work for the government?
no, I'm not with the government.
your brother was a Ranger, right?
so was I. Bravo Company, 3rd Ranger Battalion.
I know what you're going through, John. I lost a lot of good friends on the battlefield.
good men, just like your brother.
you said that...
my wife sent you?
how is she?- She's fine.
she'd be better if I could tell her how Tommy's doing.
John, I'm here for one simple reason.
you should have dropped Tommy off with his mother yesterday, according to your custody agreement.
Yeah, well, who made me sign that stupid agreement? Huh?
a judge from Chicago. A little tiny, weasel of a man, on a government payroll sat there telling me what's best for my family?
he doesn't take care of them. -- I do.
so who the hell is he to tell me how to take care of my family?!
calm down. I'm on your side. I'm not here to talk about a judge.
I'm here to talk about getting Tommy back with his mom.
no. Tommy stays with me.
okay, then... Let's go together.
John, I came here of respect for your brother.
out of respect for his sacrifice.
put the shotgun down and talk to me.
please.
okay.
keep out, huh?
what are you hiding in here, pal?
I knew you lied to me! What, you got somebody out back, huh?
Tommy, get the packs now!
no. John, this is a mistake. I'm not here to hurt you or your son.
stop talking right now. Stop talking right now.
Tommy, let's go!
where are we going? - It's okay. It's okay. We're leaving.
there are dozens of ways to disarm a man with a gun, but unfortunately, they all come with a risk that the gun will go off.
no matter how good you are, it's not something you want to try with a child present.
you lead the way. Let's go.
unless you want to tell a bereaved mom that you gambled with her kid's life, because you felt lucky.
so, where's your friend hiding?
Sam, down!- Just get away from us!
come on.
you stay on the ground! You're not taking my son! You hear me? Go.
and don't even try to follow us!
well, good news and bad news.
bad news you know --I guess I tripped the motion detector.
the good news is I planted the tracker.
now we'll know where he's going. We can get the kid back.
Sam, I don't think this is gonna be quite that simple.
we found these in John's house.
Denise: Oh, my God.
that's the place John was always talking about.
he -- he went with his friends. He called it a-a training facility.
it is, of sorts.
John's there now with your son.
Oh, God. Okay, we need to call the police. Okay, we need to call them right now.
no. That is the last thing we should do.
why not call the police, Michael?
because this isn't a summer camp, Ma.
it's the home of a fringe militia with some very antigovernment views.
how many men are in a militia?- At this one, about 20.
we have to call the police!- Trust me.
if the police show up, there will be violence.
Sam's already there, and I'm calling in some friends.
okay, I need to get my son back.
we will. We just need to be careful. - No, you don't understand, okay?
Tommy is asthmatic. The longer he stays out in those woods, the more likely...
look, I just refilled his prescription because the inhaler Tommy has with him is almost empty.
that might be something we can use.
it's not ideal...But it'll give us a reason for John to talk to us.
if anything happens to Tommy...
John has some serious problems, but he cares about your son.
I'm gonna go now, and I'm gonna get you your son back.
ma, you need to keep her calm.
she's --- She married the wrong man.
I know something about that. Just go get Tommy.
you can tell a lot about a group from looking at there base.
their fortifications can tell you whether they're focused on offense or defense.
and their vehicle type and number can tell you how mobile they are.
the most important thing to check -- their weapons.
if they're carrying M16s on full auto, you're probably not dealing with amateurscamping in the woods.
they are locked down tight.
Yep. Nobody in or out since John and Tommy arrived.
and they probably don't take too kindly to visitors.
I don't see a way to get in clean.
well, that's because there isn't. And you know what?
that's not even the bad news. That's the bad news.
guy's name is Zechariah. He's the E. N.I. C.
extremist nut bag in charge.
the ATF is investigating him for stealing C-4 from the Forest Service.
I got the kid's meds from his mom.
let me see what I can do.
Hey, son, come over here and sit down. I got this. Come here.
Hello? - John, it's Michael.
you got some balls calling me. What the hell do you want?
I want to meet. I'm outside the compound.
I told younot to follow me.- I had to.
I had to bring Tommy's medicine. John, listen to me.
the inhaler you have in there is gonna run out soon.
I need to give you a new one.
okay. So leave it outside. I'll go and get it later.
I can't do that. I promised Denise I'd make sure Tommy was okay.
I promised her I'd see him myself.
okay. Fine. I'll meet you out front in a little bit, but it's gonna take a few hours to get it approved.
I'm not going anywhere.
you're planning something, Mike. I can see the wheels turning.
this compound isn't on city power. Their generators run off that fuel tank.
if we sabotage it, we'll be able to replace it.
right. Kind of like a trojan horse play.
so someone has to ride in on a fuel truckinto that compound.
uh, yeah. That sounds dangerous.
I know their type, Sam. They're not coming out.- We have to get someone in.
and here I thought this was just gonna bea light-and-easy deal-with-Jacob week.
how many bangers we got inside?- Fiona: Three.
shouldn't be too hard for me to sneak past them.
or, you know, I could go in, and you could stay out here, because -
if you're about to say 'cause I'm a woman, I'm gonna knock your teeth down your throat.
no, Fi. One of us to stay out here and provide cover if the other one wants to bail out. We both know you're the better shot.
come on.
fine.
sneaking past trained operatives waiting in ambush is usually next to impossible.
they can stay alert through the long, boring hours of waiting, ready for action at any second.
amateurs, on the other hand, tend to relax, which can give you the opening you need.
uh, Jesse, we only needed Jacob's phone.
you might want to brush up on your counting skills.
you know what? You're in no position to lecture me about counting, lady, because there was four dudes in there, not three.
Yeah. And I think the fourth might have eaten the fifth.
well, how --- No. You know, no. Just forget it. Forget it. Let's go.
sorry. I know that took forever.
it's fine. The party hasn't started yet. Get what you need?
Yeah. Barely. Drove so fast, I think I went back in time.
it's not like I could just run outthe liquid-nitrogen store, you know. Any action yet?
no, but there's been some movement inside the compound.
my guess is they're getting re--right on cue.
how long do you need to sabotage the tank?
Ah, comfortably 20 minutes.- How about uncomfortably?
geez, Mike, I don't know. 10 minutes, but that's pushing it.
these guys are itching for action, so I should be able to keep all eyes on me for that long.
okay, I'll work as fast as I can, but don't forget -
this army may be fake, but the guns are real.- I know.
you've got 10 minutes, Sam.
coordinated covert offensives involving two teams are a lot like ballroom dancing.
you have to synchronize your steps, time your moves, and always put your partner first.
but unlike the Tango or the Two-Step, it's good form to hog the limelight during covert ops.
if all eyes are on you, your partner can work undetected on the sidelines.
all right, John. I have the medicine.
now, if he starts wheezing, take two pumps of this --You come here to insult me? Huh?
I know how to take care of my son.
no, I'm not -- no insult intended.
I lived up to my end of the bargain. Let me see Tommy.
absolutely not.
John and I had a deal. John does not make deals here -- I do.
I don't know who you are -- You want to know who I am?
I'll tell you who I am.
I am the hand of God.
I am his righteous soldier.
I am a man who stands, a man who will not kneel.
that's who I am.
that's great. I was going to say, I don't know who you are, but I doubt you're a doctor. Are you?
I didn't think so. And since you're not a doctor and the nearest hospital is miles away,
I was thinking I should give you this. It's an oximeter.
hand it over and leave.
I'll give you the box if you let me examine the boy.
now, you can either give us the box, or I will take it off your corpse.
back inside.
just wait a damn minute!
I promised Tommy's mother that I'd at least check his vitals and report back.
you failed. Report that.
I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to Tommy's father.
this is your decision, John.
like hell it is. Decisions made on this land are mine.
these are my men, and they follow my orders. This isn't even a real army.
you're not even real commander.
correct me if I'm wrong. You never served in the U. S. military.
no, never did.
I didn't think so. A real veteran always spots the fake.
I served my country, and I fought in wars.
I didn't run around he woods, acting like a soldier with my beer buddies.
I know your kind.
you think having served somehow makes you a man. Well, it does not.
you are not a man.
a man questions what he is told!
a man does not willingly accept the lies that are shoved down his throat by government!
you are of the blind, the ignorant.
me? My eyes are wide open.
and on my land, I see nothing but truth.
so I'm gonna do you a favor.
I'm going to allow you to live, let you return to the land of the weak.
now, when you get back there, I-I do want you to deliver this message.
if we see you or anyone else around here again...
we shoot to kill.
did -- did Michael see Tommy? Is he okay?
I just got off the phone with Sam.
Tommy's still in the compound with John, but Mike got him his medicine.
and they're working on a plan now to get someone in there.
Oh, thank God.
so, uh, the next step -- I'm gonna need your cellphone.
Yeah, John's not gonna take Mike's calls anymore. We figured he might take yours.
it's my son's job to fix this.
it's your job to keep it togetherfor when your boy comes home.
great job I'm doing so.
Hey, come on. Look, I was raised by a single mom. Okay? It's not easy.
you did right by your son, coming to us.
and as soon as this is over, you'll do right by him again.
using an untrained asset to make contact with a target is never ideal.
meeting in person would be an outright failure.
so it helps to do it over the phone.
that way you can write the script for the asset, and all they have to do is read -- most of the time.
I-I-I can't do this.
you can, Jacob, and you will.
I can't. I really can't. I think I'm hyperventilating.
listen to me. U do this, we find this guy, and we get rid of him.
I can't remember anything I'm supposed to say.
that's why I wrote you a script. Start dialing.
it's ringing. It's ringing.
it went to voicemail.
dude, it's me.
I don't know what's going on, but some gang guys are trying to kill me.
I think it's cause of some of the stuff you had me do.
I really need your help, man. Call me.
well, I guess that'll have to do.- What if he doesn't get it?
I mean, what if he doesn't check his voicemail or something?
ever since you fell of the grid, I'm sure your employer is dying to talk to you.
what makes you so s--It's a text. I got a text.
happy to help. Stay safe. I'll be in touch.
So...What does that mean?
it means that you're gonna hang here. I got to go.
and when your boss decides get in touch, we'll decide what our next move is.
uh, when will you be back?
soon, Jacob. Very soon.
morning, boys.
what are you doing here, shopping for gas?
no, we're shopping for a ride. See the guy in the overalls?
he owns the joint.
so I called in a big fuel order, right? He's says no, I'm tapped out.
says his whole supply's on the road by 9am.
that plus the flag on the walland the antique rifle collection -
I'd say that truck is headed for the compound.
I guess dumping the fuel worked.
well, if that's my trojan horse, I'd better saddle up.
listen, Fi, once you're inside, no unnecessary risks.
the driver's gonna take you right into the compound. Find a place to hide, and wait until dark.
okay. I just need to know where they're keeping Tommy.
I'm handling that right now.
no, John, it's Michael.
why do you have Denise's phone?
because you wouldn't take my call.
Yeah,cause I'm done talking to you.
now, what's gonna make you stop, a bullet?
I'm not stopping until I know where you're holding Tommy.
no. I'm hanging up.
no, John, just listen.
tell me where you got Tommy so I know he's okay.
Tommy is with me, okay? He's safe.
not good enough, John.
how's his breathing?
you set up a filtration system in his room, right?
no, I didn't know I was suppose to set up a -- Damn it, John, are you gonna take this seriously or not?
I need to tell them you're doing all you can, or they'll take Tommy.
at least tell me you covered the windows with trash bags.
what the hell are you talking about?
to keep out anything that would provoke an asthma attack.
Yeah. I can do that.- Okay, great. Thank you, John.
they'll be holding Tommy in the buildingwith trash bags covering the windows.
Fi, you don't have to do this. I could
Oh, please. You'll stick out like Sam's chin.
besides, I've been wanting to take a ride out to the country on the bottom of a truck for weeks.
tricking an enemy into letting you inside their strong hold is a strategy as old as the ancient Greeks.
but you don't always need to build a large wooden horse.
with a modified special-purpose insertion/extraction harness, you can hitch a ride under a vehicle...
and go right through the front door.
fuel truck was about five minutes behind us.
they must've made up some time. That sounds like our girl.
just come home in one piece.
you're almost in view of compound now.
hang on a second.
why --what the hell are those guys doing?
and now the truck is slowing down.
why is he checking behind him?
Fi, they know you're on board.
What?! How could they know?
I don't know how, but they do. You got to get off the truck now.
that's why the slowing down. Get off the truck now!
drop, Fi! Drop!
drop her!
2: 00! Over by the trees!
she's pinned down! She's not gonna make it the trees!
she'll make it now!
everybody retreat. Back to the compound!
move back! Move back!
they knew exactly where I was. How the hell did that happen?
well, they didn't spot you from the compound, and that truck was barely in sight when the militia rolled out.
and you weren't made at the gas station.
the driver was told you were on board.
so then how?
wait minute, guys. I think I know what happened.
check out those satellite dishes.
they've got signal-boosting antennas.
Yeah, and they're all pointed too low.
there's a cellphone tower back that way. I saw it when I was driving in.
well, even if they picked up cell traffic, they'd need specialized hardware to decode the signal.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they have it.
my ATF buddy told me that, in addition to stealing C-4, Zechariah was suspected of stealing military technology.
and they have our phone numbers 'cause Mike was calling in.
so we're on a party line?
well, I guess we turning phones off.
Michael: Actually, not yet. We know Zechariah's listening in, but he doesn't know we know.
so you want to stage a phone call.
Yeah, something that sells Armageddon is coming their way if they don't act now to destroy us.
okay, so we lure them out and just stroll past their undefended gates?
okay. I'm in. What do we need?
something that sells a last stand.
I think I passed just the spot.
for as long as armies have built for tification others have tried to get past them.
siege warfare can involve tunneling under, scaling over, or smashing through walls.
once you're inside, though, you're dealing with an entrenched enemy that's why the most successful siegesoften don't involve attacking at all, but tricking your enemy into coming out.
all right. I'd say that looks just like a heavily defended ammo dump.
you ready? - Yeah.
remember, we got to sell this.
well, that sure as hell didn't work!
Ah, no kidding. No kidding. We're still in one piece, but barely. What now?
now? Now we storm the compound, we tear down the walls, and we paint the ground red.
we don't have the forces we need. - Not yet.
but the cavalry's on its way.
I want every man and every weapon we have inside that shed a half a klick north of the compound. We're gonna dig in and wait.
in an hour, we'll have the muscle we need to punch in and massacre them all!
well, if that doesn't draw them out of the compound, I don't know what will.
call everybody.
we hit first with superior firepower, no one survives.
no one!
load up the trucks. Grab everything you got. Come on. Let's go, go, go!
well, looks like they're bringing every pieceof hardware they got.
I see one guard left inside.
shouldn't be too tough. Shall we?
all right, Jesse, Fi, pull him out back. Keep a lookout.
Sam and I are gonna go get Tommy. Let's go inside.
I'll give you one chance to drop your weapons, and surrender.
we got a problem.
it's not just Tommy inside.
I got to go in, alone.- Okay, but make it snappy.
once Zechariah realizes he's been duped, he's gonna be out for blood.
and the ATF is already on the way.
light 'em up!
hold it! Hold it!
surrender your weapons now!
Michael: John? It's Michael.
I'm coming in.
you again? Just stay back!
I'm not here to hurt you, John.
I just want to talk.
those bruises are fresh. What happened?
nothing! Just stay back.
I am on your side.
what happened?
he beat you, didn't he?
he order everybody out into the field, and Tommy couldn't breathe, so I-I wouldn't go, and, uh, yeah, he beat me. He broke my leg.
then Tommy got so scared, he passed out.
Hey! Stop!
I said to stay back!
look around John.
this isn't what you signed up for.
this isn't right.
well, what do you want?
the same thing I wanted when we first met --to keep your son safe.
and he's not safe here, John. He's not safe with Zechariah.
zechariah promised he'd protect us.
well, he lied to you about that. He's not you, John. He's not your brother.
I mean, think about your son.
I am thinking about him!
I'm his father!
and as his father, you have to make a choice.
if you think it's better for Tommy to shoot me, then you need to shoot me.
but if you think Tommy is better off leaving this place, then we need to get him out of here right now.
so stupid!
I believed in that man.
the radio.
radio!
Snyder! Snyder! Do you copy?! Come back!
there are many things in this world to believe in, John.
zechariah is not one of them.
son of a bitch.
you need to grab your son, we need to go now.- No.
John, what are you talking about?
you just said yourself Zechariah isn't going --No, look. I-I'm done with him. All right?
but somebody's got to stay back and -- and cover your escape.
John, listen.- Don't worry.
I'm not gonna leave my son fatherless.
get out of here.
Hey. Hey, pal.
Dad?- Hey.
so, you're gonna go with this man here.
and, uh...I just want you to know that everything I do, I do for you.
love you, buddy.
you just tell your mom that I love her, too.
okay?
I wish I could find the words. I...
you don't have to say anything. I'm just glad he's back with you.
if only John's brother hadn't died, maybe John would have taken a different path.
things happen, honey. You can't always control the way life goes.
could have been a lot worse. It's a miracle he got out of the compound.
he's checked himself into a hospital. He's gonna be okay.
and, um, the rest of them?
ATF has rounded up most of them. Zechariah's gonna spend a lot of time in prison.
so, what now?
I have family Georgia. I was thinking of moving there with Tommy.
think it'd be good for him.
you both deserve a fresh start.
I never got away from my husband.
I always regretted that.
it's incredible what you did, Michael --getting through to John.
your mom told me about your dad. I know how hard this was for you.
I-I keep thinking about Tommy.
he's gonna be okay.
how do you know?
he has a mom that loves him. He'll be fine.
I just want to go.
once we know where your former boss wants to meet and that he doesn't need to talk to you on the phone, then you'll be free to go.
I got to say, it's lucky you look like me and go to the meeting in my place.
I wouldn't call it lucky.
well, all I'm saying is, I don't want to meet the guy who wants me dead.
it's a Text.
from him. Oh, thank God! Now can I go?
hurricane Cove Marina, slip 237, 1:00 p. m. Don't be late.
now you're free to go.
Hey, uh, next time you get a job offer over the Internet, you might want to ask a few questions before you just say "Yes."
okay. Thanks.
Hey, I know you need my clothes to go pretend to be me, but when you're finished, I was wondering if I could get them back.
no.
you know what? Never mind.
Bye, Mr. Pickles.
not loving this, Mike.
the guy shot and killed a CIA officer.
he could be anywhere around here with a sniper rifle looking to do the same to you.
no, if he's trying to kill Jacob, he'll make it look like an accident.
my guess is there's a reason he wants to meet on the boat.
so you think he's planning to kill the guy, sail out, and dump the body?
sounds about right.- Yeah, like I said, not loving this .
but I'll be on Bluetooth if you need me.
Sam: You see anybody, Mike?
no, there's no one on board.
jacob just got a text.
can't make it. "Take the boat. Meet me in the Bahamas at Marsh Harbor.
marsh Harbor?
Yeah, the guy was even nice enough to leave Jacob a map showing him how to get there.
well, that was sure decent of him. What kind of game is this guy playing?
the kind that goes "boom. "Just found a bomb.
we got four pounds of C-4 wired to a trigger mechanism wired to a depth finder.
so when the boat gets into water that's deep enough, kaboom?
only thing better than killing Jacob in personis killing him when you're not even there.
I'm sending you a picture of the bomb.
get off that death trap, Mike. We'll find this guy some other way.
no, I don't want to spook him and send him into hiding.
let's let him think he killed Jacob. I'll see you in a minute, Sam.
well, this puppy wasn't made by an amateur. Look at that trigger.
Yeah. Definitely a pro.
well, that's the good news.
we can run a chemical trace on this C-4, figure out where it's from.
that, plus the components should be enoughto find out whoever built this.
I'll show this to Fi. She'll know where to start.
don't worry, Mike. We're gonna get this guy.
I know, Sam. We just need to it before the CIA comes after me for Max's murder.
time's running out. And when it does...
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...Family, too... Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line... as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
in any investigation, leads go cold fast.
it's true for cops and even truer for spies, who tend to be after a more sophisticated class of bad guy.
so if you get intelligence that the person you're chasing hired a bomb maker who lives a few hours up the highway, you can't afford to sit on the information.
you have to move immediately.
Sam, are you gonna help?
Yeah, it's just that
I mean, you really think this old guy built that bomb?
I mean, he's owned a clock shop for like 20 years.
under a different last name.
he's a war criminal, and he's hiding.
Fiona went to a lot of trouble to get that file.
if it says the bomb maker's hiding out in Tallahassee, that's where we're going.
well, I just want to be sure we're making the right move.
it's the only move, Sam.
Fiona, Sam and I won't be able to get back until late tomorrow night.
which means we're not having that dinner at the Forge.
sorry.
all right, this is important.
you want me to cancel the reservation?
there is no reservation.
I'm sorry. This guy
could help you find out who killed Max -- I know.
take these.
be safe.
three doughnuts, Sam?
I got to eat junk while Elsa's not around.
get too close, you can sense it.
I'll tell you what -- if we're after 11: 00,
I'm gonna get some cheese fries from that diner over there.
Oh, your cheese fries might have to wait.
I think this is our guy.
all right, let's see what he has to say.
or we wait till he closes up and we tail him someplace less populated.
this has nothing to do with cheese fries.
this is just tactics.
we're not gonna give that guy a day to figure out that we're watching him.
we're going in the front, we're taking him out the back.
are you the fella that fixes the clocks?
Yes, I buy, sell, and repair.
like the sign says -- I'm a clockmaker.
a football buddy of ours, well, his father passed away, left us his collection of, uh, antique clocks.
Yes, sir, and we were told that Lucien Balan's the fella we should talk to about selling them.
they're outside in the car if you want to come out and take a quick look.
spare me the trip.
please. Come in back.
I'll show you my catalogs. You show me what you have.
who told you about me?
I like to know who gives referrals.
martin McCauley up in Greenville
he sung your praises.
and this Martin
did he tell you how he knows me?
I don't hear the name Lucien much.
these days, they call me Luka.
only the smartest, nastiest war criminals make it to old age.
if you have to capture one of them, you can assume they'll have a trick up their sleeve, like a concealed weapon, a covert escape route, or a metal floor grate rigged to electrocute any unwanted visitors.
Sam, move!
stay right there.
we're gonna have a little chat, Lucien.
you'll be disappointed. I don't talk.
don't worry. We're good at getting people to open up.
now, we know you built the bomb, Lucien, but you're not the guy we're after.
just tell us who you built the bomb for, and we can share these delicious carrot sticks.
the real experts in resisting interrogation aren't the ones who stonewall in silence.
they're the ones who have mastered the art of talking about nothing, pretending to cooperate, throwing out endless leads.
there was one man.
came to the shop last Wednesday.
they use your need for information against you...
big man, like football man, but small head.
he pays with money order.
...Giving you things you want to believe.
there was also other man -- bald...
...ring in his nose.
strange, right?
Lucien, yesterday, you told us about a guy who paid with a check.
thin, like a little girl.
the day before that, it was a fat guy with a lisp.
all they're doing is running out the clock.
you're not going to break them with more conversation
you need an edge.
you know what kind of girlfriend drives all the way to Tallahassee to search a crusty old man's equally crusty apartment?
a good girlfriend. - A great girlfriend.
the kind of girlfriend who deserves dinner at the Forge.
point taken. How about two dinners?
all his personal stuff fits into one box?
he's not a big scrapbooker.
just a few photos, postcards, news clippings
not much to go on.
you're welcome.
you want to stick around, Fiona?
Oh, it's tempting, but I got to run.
I'm helping Jesse with one of his company's home-security gigs.
have fun, you two.
my husband thinks I'm crazy, and the police think I'm paranoid, but I can't shake the feeling someone's been in here.
so, three nights this week, and the alarms never went off?
not once.
you guys don't believe me, either.
no, no, no. That's not true.
we're just trying to get our heads around this, that's all.
do you have any enemies, anyone that you can think of who would want to go after you?
no. I don't think so.
and you're sure nothing was taken?
nothing was stolen -- just, um...
moved. I know I sound stupid.
no, it isn't stupid to trust your instincts.
maybe not, but it's getting expensive. Sadie...
I take it these are the new security experts.
honey -- this is Fiona and Jesse.
spare me the sales pitch.
I have already dropped 200 grand on the new alarm system.
well, just because you have all the equipment doesn't mean you know how to use it.
I think what my associate means is...
state-of-the-art security system isn't really worth much if your motion sensors are being blocked by furniture or trees are growing too close to your house.
bottom line -- what are you proposing?
we'll add some sensors, troubleshoot your existing systems.
if it helps you sleep easier, we can move you into the guesthouse and we'll be here around the clock.
if anyone shows up, we'll be ready.
and if they don't...
we can put all this behind us...finally.
when you're looking for an angle in an interrogation, it often helps to let a subject watch you go through the details of his life right in front of him.
other man visits the shop.
very blonde, like albino man.
he pays with a cashier's check.
keeping one eye on your research and one eye on his reactions can often tell you what he wants you to see...
...and what he doesn't.
finally got the old guy to blink. What did the trick?
some article about a charity 10k up in Atlanta.
three years ago.
so we found a relative? - Hopefully a close one.
one of us should run down these names -- - Yeah, not it.
you weren't expecting that, were you?
fine, but the next errand is yours.
all right, James and Sadie are sleeping, and the house is clear.
next time you offer me a job protecting an egomaniacal bastard, remind me to say no.
Seriously?
you're drinking sparkling water, munching on biscotti, and playing solitaire, Fiona-- I think you'll survive.
did you see the contempt he had for his wife?
we won't be inviting him to the Carlito for brunch anytime soon, but I don't know -- the guy's done some pretty amazing things.
I-I was reading up on him.
he developed this antiviral. It was groundbreaking.
he got honorable mention from the Nobel Foundation.
second floor, northeast corner.
that's James' office.
is that the alarm?
Yeah, there's somebody in the main house.
Oh, my God. I knew it. I knew it.
everything's gonna be fine. Just call the cops.
we'll be right back.
don't move!
put your hands up.
I'm not armed. Don't worry.
well, that's good to hear. Now put your hands up.
you want to shoot me? Go ahead. Shoot me.
I don't think you understand how this works.
you're the burglar, we're protecting the house.
I am not a burglar. - Put your damn hands on your head.
we're going downstairs.
I can't believe that after all these years he wins, just like that.
wait. What are you talking about?
what am I talking about? I'm talking about your boss.
James -- he took everything from me.
Oh, what, did he forget to mention his ex-partner?
best friend that he framed and left to die in a rat-infested prison in South America?
wait a minute. You're Dan Tesmond?
did I miss something? - HLX used to be a two-man operation.
it was James Forte and Dan Tesmond.
it took me seven years to figure out how to escape.
I scrounged together enough money to pay off a prison doctor to fake my death.
and that's just the fun part. I get back to Miami, and I found out that James had stolen my company, my future...
and my wife.
you were married to Sadie.
I'm sorry. You can tell your story to the cops.
no, no. Wait, wait, wait. We need to hear the rest of it.
Fi, we've done our job. - But what if he's telling the truth?
we're not getting involved. - Jesse, if it's true, he shouldn't be locked up again!
all right, fine.
you get him out of here, I'll buy us some time.
you're letting me go?
I'm taking you somewhere to hear you out.
and if you're lying,
I am going to push you out of an even higher window head-first.
well? Anything?
by the time we got to your office, he had already jumped out the window.
Fi's sweeping the grounds, but chances are he's long gone.
well, if he comes back, you sure as hell better catch him.
Fiona let you live. I take that as a good sign.
I told you that everything I said back there was true.
and there's more.
you know that antiviral that James supposedly created?
that was actually Dan's creation.
and that's why he set you up.
Yeah. I wanted to go public with it, help as many people as possible.
James could only see dollar signs.
he put five keys of cocaine in my bag, and he paid off a judge to make sure that it stuck.
and then James patented the gene sequence, turning HLX into a gold mine.
and Sadie left me while I was in prison.
so, I've had better vacations.
damn, you got a raw deal, man.
but why rob their house?
I was just looking for anything to get into HLX.
if he can get that gene sequence, he can finish what he started.
there are labs that will duplicate the formula and sell it generically for 1/10 the price, making it accessible to anyone who needs it.
so, you save the world while driving James out of business. I got that.
I don't see how it's actually gonna happen.
it's just a dream, man. It's over.
no, it's not.
you need more reasons to hate James?
how about rushed medical trials, victims silenced with hush money, lawsuits against anyone who speaks out?
Yeah, and my gene sequence made it all possible.
James is too dirty. He's too powerful.
and that smile needs to be slapped off his face.
so, just to clarify, you want to rip off my client?
well, no one else is gonna do it.
he can't get into HLX.
neither can we. Fi, it's a fortress.
and after last night, James is only gonna increase his security.
so if you think that somehow you
Oh.
what just happened?
I believe we decided to help you.
Really?
Ross is our head of security.
you must be Jesse Porter.
thank you for escorting them in.
well, you're -- you're actually just the guy I need to talk to.
I'm gonna need full security access to the facility.
building schematics -- - I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that's against company policy.
I see.
is it your company's policy to endanger your C. E.O.'s life?
don't worry, Mr. Porter.
HLX Medical Technologies has billion-dollar trade secrets, and we have hired a small army to protect them.
Yeah, I think we can hold our own against some nutjob who breaks into houses.
that nutjob is studying you.
he's trying to figure out what makes you tick.
that sort of obsession can become deadly in a heartbeat.
this is horrible. How can this be happening to my husband?
it's hard to say. A lot of times, disturbed people
they -- they get fixated on great men.
your husband's a great man.
we can't be too careful.
you let me inspect your office, the adjacent rooms,
I'll accompany you on your day-to-day routine.
no. I'm fine here.
your job is to keep us safe beyond those doors.
I'll call you when I'm leaving.
there's a coffee house down the street.
grab yourself a latte.
maybe you can keep that place secure.
like aikido masters, interrogators know that breaking their adversary isn't just about leverage
it's about knowing how and when to apply it.
the moment your opponent feels most confident...
good morning, boys.
...is also the moment he's most susceptible to a game-changing reversal.
it might be. It all depends on you.
you ready to talk? - Oh, yes, I am.
last night, I remember another suspicious man
customer from Tampa, with a scar.
and there's a funny story about that man.
actually, we have a funny story of our own.
it's about a war criminal.
and his daughter, in Atlanta.
my daughter.
Yes.
she visits me from Romania.
she placed third in that race.
I was very proud.
I'm sure you were. But your daughter is not a runner, and she doesn't live in Romania.
she wrote the article. It was her first.
and, uh, Danica doesn't like the family name, either.
she lives just outside of Buckhead.
for now.
see, Lucien, we're gonna have her deported unless you start talking.
who'd you make the bomb for?
where do we find him?
I don't know his phone number.
I meet him only one place
Connie's Cafe in Orlando.
talk to cook -- Nikolai.
now, promise, you better leave my daughter alone.
let's see if your facts check out.
I guess you're going to Orlando. - Not it.
what happened to the promise to run the next errand?
it's null and void when I say "Not it."
Elsa's got a sunburn, Mike.
someone's got to rub on the aloe vera.
I am sorry you had to hear that.
I'll survive.
Sam, you're not "Not it."
Jesse and I need to borrow Michael for our security gig.
Fi, you're killing me.
I'm sure Connie's Cafe will be great.
you can get some cheese fries.
need some extra manpower?
we need to shake our smug C. E.O. to his core.
you want to help me raise the threat level?
a good way to sell your expertise in protecting people is to point out holes in security that most people wouldn't notice.
excuse me.
I'm Jesse Porter. I work for Mr. Forte.
I need to talk to Ross about a security issue.
he said you might show up.
and he said he's busy.
you know what? I guess it's no big deal that your maintenance workers are just waltzing through here with no screening whatsoever.
actually, we screen every per
actually, you need to be better at what you do.
you -- come here. You too, buddy.
let's go.
let's talk about these maintenance workers.
shall we? Who's doing background checks?
pointing out holes in security is also a great way to create new holes in security.
matching names on the I. D.'s. Anyone?
um...We're on it.
you're on it. He's on it. Oh.
wow, you know, I feel so much better now that I know that you're on it.
you tell Mr. Ross that I stopped by and that I'm not impressed.
people tend to implement security based on anticipated threats.
they install firewalls and encryption if they're afraid of being hacked.
they use vaults and armed guards if they're worried about being robbed.
what the hell? - And if you need to get them to keep their personal security with them at all times, you have to make them afraid to ever be alone.
uh, who the hell are you?
you may not know who I am, but I know who you are.
you killed my mother.
what are you talking about?
I'm talking about your so-called medicine!
the medicine that was supposed to save her life.
the medicine that killed her instead.
the poison that you pushed on her. The lies!!
okay, I can see that you are very upset.
why don't we go to my office, and we can talk about this?
Oh, I've talked. I have talked plenty.
I have talked to your customer service.
I have talked to your lawyers.
all you people do is talk.
I am done talking!!
you waiting for your security guards?
the guards that look through the cameras? I took those down.
okay. You win. We're alone.
you got me. What do you want?
that is a good question.
when my mother was dying, when I was sitting there with no hope,
I thought,"What do I want?
and as I sat there, thinking and studying...
learning about how to hurt people...
it's scary, really, how much you can learn when you put your mind to it.
you know what else is scary?
how life can be so fragile.
Oh, my God! What are you doing?!
I'm teaching you.
I'm teaching you what I've learned.
how unfair life can be.
it's so delicate, so precious, and then, suddenly, it's all over in an instant.
Oh, my God! Please! No!
please, just tell me what you want!
I want you to suffer...
every moment of every single day for the rest of your life, just like I do.
and you will.
I promise you, Mr. Forte.
you will.
where were you?! The stalker was in my car!
you're fired, all of you. - I'm sorry, sir. I
you say one word, and you join them.
I heard explosions. Sir, you okay?
you have full access to HLX, any support you need.
all right, Mr. Forte. All right.
until that psycho is behind bars, you're not leaving my side.
I'd say James is sufficiently concerned about his stalker.
I've been told to protect Sadie, and Jesse now has full security access at HLX.
which means we're one step closer to the safe and the gene sequence inside it.
Yeah, but the combination
we're not using the combination. We're cracking the safe, which means getting me in there with safecracking equipment.
seriously, does this plan involve any more exploding cars?
always a good question.
unfortunately, the answer's no.
you just make sure Sadie doesn't get hurt.
sounds like you care about more than just the gene sequence.
no. I...
I mean, y-yes.
but I know there is no way that I will ever get her back.
it's been too long. Too many things have happened.
relationships have survived worse.
will you just promise me that she'll be okay?
I could care less about James
nothing will happen to Sadie.
now, how are you gonna possibly sneak inside with a bunch of safecracking stuff?
Jesse's taking care of that.
Oh, this is worse than I figured.
your office is a security nightmare.
I'm gonna need to bring in my equipment to fortify this place.
no, that's ridiculous. We're perfectly safe here, sir.
as I recall, that was your assessment of the parking garage before Mr. Forte was almost blown sky-high.
that stalker would have to get through so many guards and checkpoints to get up here.
or he could just shoot you.
you need to start thinking like him -- what does he want?
he wants to show you that he can get to you no matter where you are.
he could be lining up his shot right now.
now we need to install some blast-proof windows, embassy-grade.
Oh, my God. You're serious.
I can take care of that, sir.
as head of security for the building, I think
no. This is Mr. Porter's show.
whatever you need to make this office safe, you do it.
just remember -- any contractors you bring in here,
I'm checking them out.
I'm inspecting every nut and bolt you bring into this building.
well, there you go. Can't be too safe, right?
I'm gonna get the ball rolling soon.
we'll do the installation this weekend.
you're telling me that Nikolai quit?
well, he said he's not working anymore.
that's what "quit" means.
Oh, boy, that is just such a shame,'cause you know old Nick
he made the best goulash in all of Florida.
would you mind giving me his number?
cause I would love to have him cater my wife's birthday.
it's kind of a surprise.
look -- I got to get back to work.
you write your number down -- if he comes back in here,
I'll make sure he gets hold of you.
that's a deal.
thanks very much. Name's Chuck.
anything? - Well, there was a chef named Nikolai, but he quit a week ago.
I slipped the manager $20 to let me know if he showed up, but I wouldn't expect a call.
you think they're covering for him?
no, it didn't seem like it.
I'm thinking that Nikolai found out that Lucien was gone and he just disappeared.
I'll see you back here.
Lucien met cook.
he quit last week.
how could I know Nikolai had left?
I was here in box! Remember?
christian Pavel is my friend.
he bled for me. We fought side by side.
but I told you, I don't know where he lives.
he has no phone number.
nikolai is the only way to find him.
well, you're gonna have to think of another way.
or the feds are gonna ship your daughter back to Bucharest.
Hey, hey.
any progress with Lucien?
not much. We're letting him stew for a while.
so this is how I'm getting into HLX?
Yeah, I can't say it's gonna be comfy, but, uh, the head of security is inspecting everything I'm bringing in, so...
we're gonna need a little magic.
when you're being smuggled into a secure area, the best hiding spot is somewhere that people are confident they've checked thoroughly.
by attaching reflective window tint to multiple sheets of glass, you can create what's known as the infinity illusion.
and just like any magician won't tell you, as long as the ligh outside the space remains brighter than the inside, you'll be as good as invisible.
all right. Stop.
sorry to keep you waiting around all day just to do this, man.
can't be too safe.
you're bringing a lot of tools in here.
Yeah, I am.
how about you do your job and I'll do mine?
keep this place locked down.
lab D's that way, Mikey.
make as much noise as you can.
you sure you want to stick around? It's gonna get pretty loud.
how blast-proof is blast-proof?
Oh, we could fire a rocket launcher at him.
you'd just need a squeegee to clean up the mess.
sir.
sorry to bother you.
after the other day, I wanted to install a few more cameras.
I think there's an extra lab tech in the north wing.
footage is from 10 minutes ago.
could be our guy. It's hard to tell.
sure you didn't miscount, Ross?
I didn't miscount.
listen, I'm not taking any chances. We're headed down there.
you two stay here. Keep Mr. Forte safe.
when a plan goes wrong, it's crucial to stay cool.
you may have to bail out, but how you bail out is everything.
do you run and leave behind evidence that gives away your plan to your enemies?
or do you keep the mission alive by covering your tracks?
check "B" and "C.
this place is crawling with guards.
they'll shoot you before you get anywhere near the door.
that is your problem. That is not my problem.
Ross, you see him yet?
Freeze! - Don't move!
put your hands on your head!
I have a little announcement to make.
Ross here is wired with a half a pound of high explosive.
you shoot at me, and we all go boom.
so I'm gonna make it real easy.
you're gonna let me walk right out the front door.
Oh, my God.
am I TV?
think Mr. Forte's watching?
Yeah. Grab the radio.
grab your radio. Bring it up.
turn it on. Turn it on!
Hey, Mr. Forte. I just want to take this opportunity to share something else I learned when I was reading at my mother's deathbed.
you know why hell is scary?
it's not the pain, it's not the torture, it's not burning in a lake of fire.
it's that it lasts forever -- just like me.
so let me be the first to tell you
welcome to hell, Mr. Forte.
welcome to hell.
somebody, drop that guy.
somebody shoot him! Now!
bad idea. Bad idea.
y'all want to die? You don't want to die.
no one follows.
the morning after a failed operation you have two choices.
you can admit defeat and lick your wounds, or you can re-engage immediately, sticking by your enemy so you'll be in position when you find another opening.
all right, so our associates are analyzing the security tape from yesterday.
we're hoping to get a lead on our guy.
and you really think that your team is better than the cops for that.
without a doubt. - So in the meantime, we're gonna need to do a top-down security review of HLX
just completely lock this place down.
no, no, no. It's clear that he can get to me whenever he wants.
the spectrum analyzer is smashed.
those samples are ruined.
and the research inside of that safe is worth a billion dollars -- easily.
well, then, we'll bring in better guards to protect it.
no, we're moving it off-site.
I've already talked to Ross.
I'm taking the research to a bank vault up in Palm Beach.
And...you're sure you want to trust Ross...
with that? No, no.
Mr. Forte -- - This isn't up for discussion.
I am telling you what is happening.
an armored truck is on its way.
Fiona, you're to keep Sadie safe at home.
wait, where are you going?
I'll be in the convoy, and Mr. Porter here is coming with me.
no, James. You can't risk your life for some research.
well Sadie, I appreciate your input, but you run our third-world outreach, and I will take care of the business side of things.
you meet me here in an hour.
what comes to mind when you think of the First Federal Bank of Palm Beach?
the most secure vaults in South Florida.
Why? - I'm afraid that's where my least favorite C. E.O.
is taking the gene sequence. - Oh, great.
the only place safer than inside HLX.
we're -- we're done. It's over.
not necessarily.
we just need to grab it before it gets to Palm Beach.
well, that's easier said than done.
James is using an armored truck.
two cars full of guards.
armed convoy. I don't like our numbers.
we don't need numbers.
we just need to convince James that his armed convoy won't keep him or the gene sequence safe.
well, I'm riding along. We'll have the route.
I'll call Sam, see if I can't slow you guys down. - All right.
you got to let me help, if there's anything I can do.
all right. I'm gonna get over to Sadie's place.
even a fender-bender can stop traffic for a few minutes, but creating a longer-lasting roadblock is about provoking an emergency response.
cops and firefighters won't go anywhere near a burning chemical truck billowing smoke that looks toxic.
which means you can get four hours of roadblock with a smoke canister and a little gasoline.
what do you think?
looks scary.
good. That's the idea.
now let's get out of here.
come on, it's taking forever, Ross.
what, are you getting paid by the mile?
we're not taking this route for the scenery.
now stay off the radio.
all right, as soon as the research is safe, we're taking you underground.
what the hell?
Oh, come on.
come on.
nobody's getting through here.
but we're heading to Palm Beach.
y'all got to take the detour to I-95, - down that road a few miles. - Unbelievable.
there had to be an accident!
today of all days!
you know what? This is no accident.
no, this is way too convenient. This is your stalker.
we have kept this whole thing completely under wraps.
how would he even know we took this road?
well, that's a damn good question -- Ross?
tell anybody our route? - No.
of course not. Let's get moving.
no. No. We're not going anywhere until we sort this out.
you stay put.
sleight-of-hand tricks aren't just for kiddie parties.
the same misdirection and quick moves that a magician uses to find a quarter behind a 5-year-old's ear can also help an operative plant a listening device in someone's car.
what the hell are you doing?
are you kidding me?!
your car's bugged.
I never saw that before.
Yeah, of course not, because you're bad at your job.
did you sweep the armored truck?
did you sweep the other town car?
the only car that I know is safe is the Mercedes because I searched it myself this morning.
sweep the other cars! Go!
this guy is ahead of us at every turn. He could be anywhere.
all right, well, we need to think like him.
where does he want us to go?
the detour, 95.
maybe if we take the back roads.
with this many vehicles, he's gonna be able to spot us no matter where we are.
our best bet -- we have Ross take the Mercedes to 95, with the convoy. Use that as a decoy.
then you and I, we split off, we go our own way.
I can't leave the research.
then bring it. Bring it with you.
you want me to pull my stuff out of the armored truck?
the armored truck, your car -- they're targets.
you have worked for me for five days.
I cannot believe that I am seriously considering this.
Mr. Forte, it's completely your call.
whatever you think is safest.
change of plans! Open the truck!
no sign of him yet. I'm gonna call Ross.
no, no. No way. Stay off your phone.
we got to take every precaution.
Yeah, good...thought.
w-where are you going?
I just have a... quick stop to make.
Oh, my God. Back up -- now.
back up! Let's go!
Oh, no, no, no. Um, actually, this is our stop.
that's your cue to get out.
get out of the car.
y-you're supposed
I wanted to tell you the good news, Mr. Forte.
I'm not your stalker.
Dan is.
what, are you surprised to see me after dumping me in a Chilean prison to die?
Hey, jackpot!
now I know why you wanted to keep this safe.
there's more than just a gene sequence in here.
we've got records of payoffs, medical trial reports.
you've been naughty.
Oh, that's what this is all about.
this is -- you're all in on this.
this is just about ripping me off, huh?
no, we're just taking back what was rightfully mine.
what the hell?
we can make all of this go away. You just name your price.
don't you get it? This was never about money.
this was about saving lives.
this was about my company.
this was about you stealing the only woman that I ever loved.
you want to save lives -- let's save lives.
I'll give you a piece of the company.
Sadie was no catch.
you can consider yourself lucky.
you just tell me what you want, and we can make all of this go away.
Sadie, I-I can explain.
I've heard everything I need to.
and we have everything we need.
getting back into HLX is gonna be a long process, but it sounds like the Board of Directors is on my side.
your old friend James won't be around for a while.
he's looking at 5 to 10 for conspiracy.
Yeah, he's stiffing me on the security gig.
thanks for that, Fi.
all right, I got to get back to work.
good luck with everything, Dan. - Thank you.
thanks so much. - All right.
and I-I really want to thank you guys -- for everything.
and, uh, Sadie wants to thank you, too.
no, we're just talking, getting reacquainted.
I mean, it's never gonna be...
how it was, but it's a start.
you guys have a second chance.
thanks again.
I hope he makes the most of it.
he escaped prison and traveled a few thousand miles to get her back.
that should count for something.
grand gestures are great.
sometimes I think it's the day-to-day stuff that's the hard work.
you know who I am, Fi. I'm not
yeah...I know.
and I know that you and Sam have a Romanian bomb maker to break, so, uh, we'll talk later.
I know this place is not so bad
the chairs, the carrots
I'm starting to like our conversations.
one way or another, they're about to end.
either you tell us how to find the guy who you built the bomb for, or your daughter's on the next flight to Bucharest.
very well. I'll tell you.
there's a pier in Daytona Beach.
you walk to the end of it...
jump off, swim to the bottom of the ocean, and you call out,"Vladimir.
you think I'm bluffing.
what was that? - I don't know.
that trip to the diner was a distress call.
you think I would give up my friend after so many years?
there are bonds no man can break.
now my friend has come to rescue me.
let me go, and maybe I'll tell him to let one of you live.
Mike, get down!
work long enough as a spy, and you learn that distress calls don't always work exactly as planned.
just because someone calls for help doesn't mean they're going to get it.
a surprisingly high percentage of the time, friends turn out to be less concerned with rescue...
...and more concerned with making sure no one talks.
Lucien, he betrayed you! You still want to protect him?!
Mike, we got to go -- now!
get us some cover. - With what?
I don't know! Something! Just get it fast!
about my daughter.
give me your word!
I give you my word.
you give us the information, and your daughter will be left alone.
the man outside... he needed a bomb.
he was my friend, and so I said yes.
where, Lucien?! Where is his place?
warehouse... in Wynwood...
end of Burnnam Road.
and when you find him, put a bullet in him.
okay, I think I got us covered.
let's go.
he's gone, Mike. We lost our only lead.
not quite. Lucien told me where to find him.
well, then, I think we owe that son of a bitch a visit.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies - A bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line - As long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
in the intelligence community, the enemy is less likely to hide behind kevlar and camouflage than offshore accounts and blind trusts.
once you pick up a bad guy's money trail, though, finding them is just a matter of doing your homework.
if you can find where they spend their cash, you know where they are.
if you can find where they got their cash, you can figure out where they came from.
ravel Stigler - unofficial banker to cold-war leftovers, including our mystery man, Tavian Korzha.
so we know who Max's killer got his money from. What now?
Yeah,"what now?" is the problem.
Stigler's got a nasty reputation, runs with heavy security.
talking to him's gonna be a lot harder than finding him was.
and finding him was very hard.
I'm being framed for murder, Sam.
he may be my only link to the real killer. I'll take my chances.
uh, yeah, mike, maybe not.
I mean, the CIA investigation is getting pretty close.
I think your best bet is to cozy up with Pearce and see what she knows.
Sam's right.
we'll run point on Stigler.
we just need an approach.
well, this might help.
I found some messages between Tavian and his money lender.
it sounds like Stigler thought he was financing an import business, not a killing spree.
so Tavian lied to him. You think that's enough to bond with the guy?
it'll have to be.
Hey. - Want a beer?
no, I prefer to be sober when I'm risking my life. Thanks.
is Stigler here?
private party in the back.
he's got a lot of friends here.
I'm thinking we got about a minute of alone time when this goes down.
well, we better talk fast, then.
Hey, bathroom's that way, right?
hello.
you break into my place like this.
are you insane, or you want to die?
uh, neither - we just need a minute of your time.
you have as long as it takes for my men to break down that door and shoot you in the head.
well, then, we'll get right to the point.
you loaned money to a man named Tavian, correct?
Tavian - In my country, this is popular name, like "Bob."
we'll take that as a yes.
do you know what he did with that money?
he used it to kill a CIA officer.
I am businessman. This does not concern me.
no? Maybe that does.
Lucien. He is a friend.
what do you know of him?
we know he's dead.
you lie.
check for yourself.
Tavian used the money to buy an hk91.
then he used that gun to murder Lucien.
how do you know this? - I was there.
I'll ask around.
hope for your sake you're telling the truth.
your life depends on it.
trust me, buddy - we got a few lives riding on this one.
solving the murder of a covert operative is a little different than most homicide investigations.
the pool of suspects is smaller, but so are the odds that the killer got sloppy.
when leads are more precious and motives more plentiful, you have to look at the case from every angle because you never know where you'll find the killer.
agent Pearce, how is it going?
the Romanian connection looked so promising.
but so far, nothing.
then take me off the bench.
I'd like to, but langley was so impressed with your work in our last extraction, they've made you their go-to bad-guy grabber.
so where am I heading to now?
Puerto la cruz - Beach town outside caracas.
we intercepted some Russian chatter.
seems one of their assets is taking a little vacation there with his wife.
this asset have a name?
they refer to him only as "Cheshire."
he creates the nasty bugs used in germ warfare for the eastern bloc.
other than that, we don't know much.
you want me to bring him back so you can get to know him better?
his wife, too - She might know something.
I'm an equal-opportunity extractor.
speaking of wives, this job calls for a Brendan and Christina Johnson.
it's a couples' resort.
I was supposed to be Christina, but I don't want to lose my head of steam with Max's case.
so I got tickets for you and Ms. Glenanne.
the agency approved FI?
as you know, relations with Venezuela are sensitive.
if things go wrong, it's easy for the CIA to disavow
burned spy and his arms-dealer girlfriend tried to get chummy with a mad scientist.
good to know langley has our backs.
go. Have fun.
bring me back a souvenir or two... ...preferably in cuffs!
I like a good extraction as much as the next girl.
but when I asked for quality time, I didn't mean on a job.
don't think of it as a job - Think of it as a romantic getaway, FI.
a romantic getaway - Tracking a biological-weapons engineer?
the resort has a full-service spa and a four-star restaurant with chef...
as much as I would enjoy a meal that doesn't come from a yogurt cup, it's not about fancy trips for me.
it's about... connecting.
I thought we were connecting just fine last night.
you know that's not what I mean.
I know, but sometimes it's really hard to read your mind.
how is it, when you are dealing with drug lords or mob bosses, you know exactly what to say and do, but when it comes to me I'm trying, FI. I mean, I thought this would be a good start.
it's not ideal, but we'd be together.
and vacationing on the CIA's dime is not all that bad.
look - we've got a discretionary fund.
I'll add a new dress to my collection... And some shoes.
here you go, Consuelo. It's all yours.
so, you think Stigler's gonna show?
well, we crashed his party and asked him to give up one of his customers.
whether it's to help us or kill us, he'll show.
Oh, here we go.
Hey, fellas.
how's the thumb?
checked with my guys.
it seems what you say about Tavian is true.
Hey, would I steer you wrong?
he comes Tuesday, 2:00.
he parks here in alley.
he comes in, takes money, goes back to car, and leaves - In and out, maybe a minute.
long enough to grab him.
Tavian is a dangerous man.
if you fail, it will be bad. You understand?
believe me, we understand.
okay. So, Mike and FI get to kick back and sip mojitos in the sun, and we get to set a bear trap for an international killer.
sweet.
working a cover at a foreign resort isn't about keeping a low profile
it's about having as much access as possible.
arrive in a nice car and tip extravagantly, and the service staff will open all sorts of doors for you.
if you want to rub elbows with the other guests, select a cover that gives you an excuse to be social and a reason for the hotel to upgrade you to a central room.
"travel writer" usually works fine.
we have a lovely suite for you.
please enjoy your stay.
thank you.
it's a good idea to make use of all the hotel's amenities.
a laptop and some hacking software can get you access to the hotel's database...
and give you free pay-per-view in the process.
how does the discretionary fund look?
expensive.
four couples' check-in dates match Cheshire's.
so one of these guys is our germ maker.
tonight's the perfect time to check them out.
aren't you forgetting something? - No, no.
I downloaded their room numbers onto my phone.
we're Mr. And Mrs. Jensen, were we not?
aren't you gonna get down on bended knee?
we got work to do.
it's an ugly rock, anyway.
well, I'll give you this. - This is the nicest place you've ever taken me for surveillance.
all of our Cheshires are here.
from the looks of it, so is the rest of the resort.
thank god these heels have arch support.
shall we?
I thought you'd never ask.
when gathering intelligence, operatives often rely on binoculars, hidden cameras, and electronic listening devices, but sometimes all it takes is a well-dressed date and a decent sense of rhythm.
if you're light on your feet, you can study a crowd without standing out in it and examine every angle of a room with a simple spin.
the first step, of course, is identifying your surveillance targets
locating them, assessing them, and coming up with a strategy for further intelligence gathering.
the worst thing you can do at this point is rush things.
your goal is to blend in, plan your moves, and let the dance carry you where you need to go.
shall we tango? - Let's.
can I lead? - Fine. Just this once.
the simplest kind of surveillance, of course, is eavesdropping Easy enough on the dance floor, where getting close to people is simply a matter of knowing the right moves and using them at the right time.
he better make me first chair.
I've earned it.
Oh, he's the bad guy, but just the lawyer kind.
more direct approaches can work, as well.
dancing alongside someone for an evening can give you a perfect excuse to strike up a conversation and find out what you need to know.
you and your husband make such a cute couple.
Oh, we're not married - yet.
they're not married.
you can even pull off a covert weapons check, if you're careful.
under his jacket - Could be a gun.
spin me.
excuse me.
smartphone.
doesn't mean he's not our guy.
it has to be Serge and Karina.
they don't dance, they've barely touched their drinks, and they keep eyeing the door.
well, unless Serge is a child prodigy, he's way too young to be a bioweapons guy.
you have a better prospect?
it's those two.
they're using a fake name.
and how do you know that?
they're listed as Kevin and Nicki Skylar, but when the waiter called him "Mr. Skylar," it took him a good two seconds to react.
well, maybe he was preoccupied.
you know men - So easily distracted.
Yeah, one way to find out - They're staying in room 441.
we should go before they finish dinner.
we don't get to finish our wine?
it's a kosta browne.
work fast. I'll keep watch.
an outlet is the ideal place to plant a bug in a hotel.
not only do they provide power, but any audio picked up can be transmitted through the wires to any other outlet in the building, as long as you can manage to hook into a live circuit without electrocuting yourself.
hurry, Michael. The skylars are calling it an early night.
30 seconds.
more bad news - We were both right.
Mr. Skylar is the death merchant.
my couple - bodyguards.
let's go. - Not this way. It's too late.
you know - god.
as a spy, improvising to get out of tough situations is just part of the job.
sometimes that means stealing a car to get away from a gun battle.
we gonna have any privacy ever?
they have to check the room.
other times, it means destroying a $2, 000 dress to climb down safely from a hotel balcony.
you do what you have to do to survive, but it doesn't mean you won't upset someone in the process.
you always know how to show a girl a good time, Michael.
will you just - Will you please put away that bottle and calm down, Nicki?
you're being irrational.
I don't even know what you're saying.
I am saying that this trip is so lame, I could scream!
keep your voice down, will you?
are you really gonna listen to this all night?
there's trouble in paradise.
I think you get the gist.
the more we know about them, the easier it will be to get them to the helipad for the extraction, FI.
I think we know plenty.
they're American... Traitors, married.
apparently, they hate each other.
do you think that I just wish your Prada bags into existence, Nicki?
I have to work for them.
what the hell do you want from me?
I want to go on a vacation where I don't have Russian goons telling me where to go or what time I have to go to bed!
I want a real life!
I guess selling bioweapons secrets wasn't quite the opportunity they thought it would be.
it sounds like Nicki is desperate for some social contact and a little taste of the good life.
how would you feel about making a new friend tomorrow?
why not?
we have a lot in common.
we both have good taste in handbags, work-obsessed men.
at least I don't sell WMDs to dictators.
I'm, uh... I'm drawing a bath.
there's room for two.
I would love to, but I have to type up these notes.
okay.
for a spy, making an approach is about problem solving.
whether it's a bad marriage or an unsatisfying job, you look for the problem, the issue on the target's mind.
can I get you something, Mr. Jensen?
Yes, I'm hitting the golf course, but my wife would like a little champagne and caviar.
it's our anniversary, so make it the good stuff, will you?
of course, sir.
once you know the problem, it's just a matter of turning yourself into the solution...
I'll just need your signature.
...and arranging a meeting.
champagne and beluga caviar.
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I didn't order this.
from your husband.
I wish!
my husband isn't that splurgy.
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
I think that might actually be mine. I'm so sorry. Here.
yum.
about $1, 000 worth of yum.
my husband and I only do this about once a month, so we try to make it count.
you know, my hubby is busy.
why don't you join me?
um... I shouldn't.
there are no shouldn'ts on vacation.
okay. Yeah, hit me.
hitting.
thank you.
I'm Christina. - Nicki.
nice to meet you.
Where's your husband?
he is, uh, probably on the phone somewhere, as usual.
mine's the same way.
and actually, Brendan is being a good boy today.
he's arranging a helicopter ride for us.
apparently, it's the best way to see the rainforest.
of course, he's only doing it because I twisted his arm.
here's to... Being the better half.
I'll drink to that.
there he is.
this is Christina.
Yeah, we met at the pool.
Oh, nice to meet you.
champagne?
no, thank you.
that's my husband - A buzzkill.
I take it this isn't your first bottle, Nicki.
Christina, making new friends?
honey, this is Nicki.
Oh, and you must be Brendan. - Yes.
you never said how handsome he is.
Brendan. - Kevin.
darling, did you book the helicopter tour?
I tried to get something cozy, but all they had was a six-seater.
that seems like such a waste.
I know. Why don't you join us?
there's plenty of room, and we would love the company.
that would be so fun.
Oh, that's incredibly generous, but, uh, we can't.
I'm sorry.
seriously, Kevin... - Look, don't decide now.
let's all grab dinner and discuss it then.
what do you say?
we'll think about it.
Ohh, well, hopefully, we'll see you later.
I don't think they're going for it.
I know what she's thinking. I know that look she gave him.
I'm not so sure
Christina! We're in.
since you guys got the helicopter tour, dinner's on us.
see you at 7: 00! - 7: 00.
told ya.
according to my napkin, Tavian should pull up... Right, like, here-ish.
then he goes into the back of the bar, gets the money, comes back out here, goes this way.
Yeah.
I think we can stop him right around that ketchup stain.
you talking about that grate right there?
I'm talking about that grate right there.
all right, cool.
I got everything we need in the back of FI's car.
Yeah, about that - Are you sure that FI is cool with us borrowing her wheels?
well, she's gonna have to be. The Porsche is getting a tune-up.
okay, let's do it.
pinning down a moving target is all about preparation and timing.
if your target will be driving, the first task is to stop the vehicle.
if you have room, a bigger vehicle will do the trick.
but if space is tight, you have to improvise.
finally, if you know where the target vehicle is headed, a directional blast that can launch a projectile into the engine of a car at high speed will stop it in its tracks.
you just have to find a place to plant it and wait.
that ought to do it.
let's go eat. Dinner's on me.
stunning views, booze on board.
you're gonna love this chopper ride.
what's wrong, Nicki?
you've barely touched your mousse.
I didn't want to ruin our meal.
it's just that... My husband said that we can't go on the tour.
what? Why?
ask him.
um, I'm afraid we don't have time.
of course you have time.
it's just a day ride.
I said I don't have time.
Kevin, you're being rude.
sorry, I just have work.
my bosses need us to be home tomorrow night.
as a spy, you're trained never to pitch assets in situations you don't control.
still, you can't always avoid it.
if it's a choice between that or losing the asset altogether, sometimes you have to grit your teeth and roll the dice.
let's stop with the charade, Kevin.
you and I have a lot in common.
we both work hard, we both love our wives, and we're not who we claim to be.
excuse me?
hear him out... And smile and nod as you do, or we're all gonna get shot by your bodyguards.
I'm a broker of sorts, for people with skills to sell, like you.
I- I don't know what you're saying.
of course you do.
Kev, I can guess how it all went down, actually.
it's always the same drill - You were at some pharma conference...
probably talking about diet drugs or cholesterol pills.
...wasting that brain of yours, and then someone made you a better offer.
promised you the world.
and then that promise didn't really pan out, now, did it?
how did you know that?
Nicki. - What?!
the Russians are all talk.
if you're gonna sell out, you do it to the highest bidder.
I can double what you make right now, and I won't insult you by pushing a babysitter on you.
Fiona: looks like those babysitters are getting suspicious.
Brendan... I can give you everything you want, but you have to decide right now
do you want to go back to the gulag with your millions that you'll never spend or...
or would you like to come with us to our private helicopter, champagne on ice?
sweetheart... Say yes.
you have five seconds.
Kevin, please? - Fine. I'm in.
laugh, now, as loud as you can.
now you see why I make him tell all his stories in his inside voice.
inside voice!
you are so bad!
to new friends.
new friends.
Kevin, you don't like your champagne?
I don't want champagne - I don't even want to be in this pool.
that's hilarious.
remember, we're supposed to keep up appearances.
appearances, I know - You keep saying that.
what you didn't say was how any of this was actually going to work.
well, first, stay calm, sip your bubbly, just relaxing with friends.
please. Relax?
he forgot the meaning of that word when he started working for the Russians.
our chopper arrives at 4: 00.
we'll all meet at the helipad as soon as we ditch your babysitters.
that's your plan - Ditch them?
we can't ditch them.
they never let us leave their sight.
not to mention - They're always carrying a gun at all times.
I mean, if we try to run, they're gonna shoot us.
we won't give them the chance.
Kevin, you and I are going to the steam room for a little relax.
serge won't be able to wear his kevlar vest or his machine pistol on him under his towel.
and we have lunch at a chic restaurant across town.
we have reservations on the patio.
Karina will be stuck at the bar, which gives us enough room to slip away.
are you sure? Those guys are seriously scary.
trust me - we'll have everything we need to take care of them.
and once we lose them and get to the cars, we'll have plenty of firepower.
I don't know. This seems like an awfully big risk.
with an even bigger reward at the end of it.
just think of the life you'll have.
anything is better than this life.
the scary part is almost over.
and soon, we'll all be filthy rich.
we should get dressed for lunch.
I'll see you later, darling.
be careful.
I'll miss you, too.
so, who do you think's having more fun right now?
Mike and FI in paradise, waiting for mojito refills, or you and me in a back alley, waiting for a Romanian assassin?
I'd be having a lot more fun if Tavian would show up already.
should have been here a half-hour ago - it's hot.
do you think Stigler might have tipped him off?
I don't know. I'll go ask him.
do you mind watching my back, just in case Tavian's fashionably late?
as long as you bring me a beer on the way back out.
Oh, damn it.
Sam, we got a problem. Stigler's dead.
hands up. Phone off - now.
Sam, can you hear me?
nice place.
you bring all your kills here, or is this our special spot?
if I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already.
I want a meeting with Michael Westen.
you're gonna arrange it.
you want to meet with Mike?
you killed his buddy and framed him for murder.
I don't think he's really eager to grab a latte with you.
you can tell him about the meeting, or I can send him a written invitation, pinned to your corpse.
let's go with option "A."
tell Michael I want a truce, and I have answers.
yeah? To what?
the questions he doesn't even know to ask.
I'm sure Mike would be very intrigued, but he's a little busy right now.
tell him to clear his calendar.
tomorrow, 6:00 p. m. brickell key park.
I won't wait.
people tend to overestimate the value of weapons.
choosing the time and place of a fight is often more important than having a lot of firepower.
it doesn't matter if all you've got is some spa rocks and a wet towel.
if you can surprise an unarmed opponent on favorable ground, that can be all you need.
Kevin, sit down. You're supposed to relax.
you know what? I'll be relaxed when we're in the air and this dump is just a speck on the horizon.
we're almost there.
all you have to do is soak in the healing mist and distract Serge when he shows up.
and then - then, once you get your, uh - your opening, I can - I can go, right?
you go back to the locker room.
you wait there.
just kill some time.
fantasize about how much money you're gonna make.
about that
I have been working on this new neurotoxin like nothing you have ever seen.
I am talking total organ failure.
they drop like that.
Russians weren't interested, but North Koreans might be.
we'll shop it around.
you'll get what you deserve.
you should have waited for me before coming in here.
do I need to, uh, have you escort me to the bathroom, too?
I'm fine, Serge.
where is your friend?
how the hell should I know?
maybe he's getting a massage.
sleep tight, Serge.
well, it seems the boys had a cleansing sweat - Rid themselves of unwanted company.
well, then, I guess that means it's our turn.
I picked the key to the patio door off the bar manager.
so, I'm gonna get up, lock the door, and then we'll start making our way out of here.
well, do you really think a locked door is gonna stop her?
no, but it'll buy us enough time to get to the car.
I think I'm gonna need a glass of wine - Maybe a bottle.
all you need is to stay calm.
this only works if Karina has no idea what's going on.
okay. Yeah, I can do that.
Hey, Nicki. - Yeah?
keep staring at Karina like a scared little bunny, you're gonna tip her off.
just... Take in the view.
read the menu.
focus on anything but her, okay?
okay.
I'm gonna go to the buffet now.
okay.
what did I tell you about those bunny eyes? Come on.
sorry.
we've got to get to the car.
Geez!
call for help!
my phone is at the bottom of the bay. We're on our own.
we're gonna have to make a run for it.
okay, well, the car is way too far from here.
well, then, we'll arrange for another mode of transportation.
keep your head down. Follow me.
um, I don't ride.
Yeah, but you know how to be clingy.
as tactical vehicles, motorcycles have advantages and disadvantages.
their off-the-line acceleration leaves most four-wheel vehicles in their dust.
but as a vehicle for bursting through a roadblock, you can't do much worse.
what are you doing? Why are we stopping?
your babysitter must have called all her Russian friends.
we'll never make it past that roadblock.
well, can we go back out to the main road?
Karina will have that covered.
okay, so let's hide. Let's go into the woods.
they'll comb every inch of those trees.
it's not a question of if they get us - It's a question of when.
we have to stay and fight.
I dig the girl power, but, uh, Karina - She brought her friends - We're outnumbered.
they're totally gonna kill us.
probably... But I'm not a big fan of going quietly.
Where's our chopper?
it'll be here in five minutes.
five minutes... And we are home free.
our wives should have been here by now.
their route was shorter than ours.
they're not answering. Something's wrong.
maybe they hit traffic.
if Karina was tipped off, she would have called in reinforcements and cut off the roads.
it's right out of the FBI playbook.
we're going back for them.
are you insane?
no, you said yourself our chopper's gonna be here in five minutes.
it's time to cut our losses.
our losses?
I can see why your wife finds you so charming.
help me clean off these bullets.
at least we'll stand a fighting chance.
he had a medical degree.
what girl goes wrong marrying a doctor?
if I had known what I was signing up for, I would never have accepted this damn ring.
you know what I mean?
not really.
mine's a fake.
Really?
they're here.
keep those coming. Get down.
two down, one to go.
here. That's our last bullet.
she's coming.
get back.
gun problems?
Michael. How'd you find me?
I know you.
you'd want to go down guns blazing.
nice place for a last stand.
it's not over.
Karina sent for backup - 12: 00.
and at 6: 00.
shall we?
I thought you'd never ask.
I'm out.
get over here, Nicki.
reloading.
ready? - Move!
what's, uh - What's with the commandos?
get in the chopper.
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere until I know exactly where that thing is going.
virginia, CIA headquarters in langley - Maybe a quick stop in the caribbean.
Guant namo's lovely this time of year.
Oh, my god.
it's okay. They'll cut a deal with you.
and later, you can pawn that ring and start anew.
what about me, huh?
I'm not gonna get a deal.
you think I'm getting on that thing?
there is no way - No way!
stand down. Fine.
you want to stay here? Good luck with your Russian friends.
after your daring escape, don't expect a warm reception.
okay, you know what? I know my rights.
you will never get a word out of me!
yeah? Well, they're gonna get plenty out of me!
thank you, Michael.
for what? - Quality time.
okay, I appreciate it. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Tavian said 6: 00 p. m. right?
any word? - No.
haven't heard from Mike, either.
he must still be flying back.
I can't believe he's gonna be late to his own showdown.
well, my buddies in homeland security just bought us some time.
they came through, man - By land, by sea, and by air.
Yeah, you must have called in a lot of favors.
uh, yeah, that, and I kind of told them I was tracking a smuggled weapon that may or may not be leaking radioactive material.
you went nuclear on them?
Yeah, I figured it wasn't time to pull punches.
it should buy us at least four hours.
well, let's hope Mike gets here quick.
Yeah, if Tavian hasn't stood him up.
Hey, speak of the Tavian, I'll make sure he's here.
yeah? - I thought we had an agreement.
where is Michael Westen?
well, he's at brickell key park, just like you wanted.
he's not there.
you're lying.
what? Me lie? No, he's there. Check again. It's a big place.
maybe you haven't looked hard enough.
I'm on brickell key, staring at the meeting point.
no Michael.
well, I guess he just must be running late.
you know, I'm not a patient man.
this is a one-time offer.
we're done.
Yeah, uh, before you skedaddle, you might want to take a look at the water.
you see those police patrol boats?
they're not letting any boats in or out for the next two or three hours.
we've also locked down the airspace.
Oh, and in case you were planning a road trip, I wouldn't exactly pack your bags.
you'll get your meet with Mike, but you're gonna have to wait.
well, we got the tiger by the tail.
Yeah, I just hope it doesn't rip Mike's head off when he gets here.
Fiona: you know, I've been thinking - The world is a dangerous place.
I bet there are lots of wanted types laying low in Spain, Italy, France.
are you volunteering for more extraction jobs?
Paris is lovely in the spring.
I guess I won't be needing this anymore.
let me.
Mr. Jensen, it was nice being married to you.
you too, Mrs. Jensen.
maybe I'll hang onto this - Never know when I'll need it... For another job.
well, next time I'm your wife, I prefer an asscher-cut diamond.
good to know.
well, I guess the honeymoon's over.
I'm, uh - I'm gonna go to the tailor.
maybe he can turn my ripped gown into a mini-dress.
I'm gonna check in with Sam and Jesse about the Tavian situation.
happy hunting.
maybe later, when you're done, we could do a little reconnecting.
agent Pearce.
make yourself at home.
sorry. I let myself in, but I've got something that couldn't wait.
I think I have a break in Max's murder case.
since you've worked so hard on this, I thought you should be the first to know.
you made it through all the files I gave you?
not yet.
remember a few weeks ago, I said we couldn't find anything on the traffic cams?
our killer was smart enough to avoid all of them, which means, at some point, he'd have to turn down... Here.
now, 3rd street has a law firm with security cameras on the entrance and lots of glass walls, which means you can see the passing cars.
I pulled the footage from after Max was shot
image wasn't great, but NSA helped me clean it up.
check it out.
I can explain.
the man who killed Max... - It was you.
you lied to me.
you were there.
you killed him!
no, Pearce. No.
I was framed, and I knew I would go down for this if I didn't find the guy who did it!
now, I couldn't trust you back then.
listen to me. I found him.
stop lying.
he's Romanian.
his name is Tavian.
Sam and Jesse are tracking him right now.
just let me make one phone call
don't even think about it.
you are making a mistake!
my mistake was trusting you.
let's go - now!
my name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing...
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am i? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...- Should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies.A bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line...As long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
Max! What happened? Who did this to you?
say goodbye for me. - Max!
whoever did this managed to put a murder weapon in michael's hands and get away clean.
our killer's in there. We should go in now.
Mike, there's the guy!
Max's KILLER ,we got to find this guy, and the only thing we got now is a thoroughly toasted computer.
we got to make it fast, Sam. I already talked to pearce.
she's investigating the warehouse fire.
you lied to me. You killed him!
I was framed. He's romanian. His name is Tavian.
Sam and Jesse are tracking him right now.
just let me make one phone call...
don't even think about it.
come on, mike. Pick up. Pick up.
this is michael. Leave a message.
damn it. - He's still not answering?
Yeah. Fi said she was with him like 15 minutes ago.
something's not right.
pull over up here. I want to take a peek at Mike's loft before we get there.
Oh, son of a bitch. It's the feds.
I had a feeling. Take a look.
I guess pearce finally caught up with us. - Looks like mike's already in custody.
she's gonna be after us, too.
I'm not ready to say this is over yet. Are you?
Well...What are you thinking?
I'm thinking that pearce is taking mike to a federal holding facility downtown right now.
now, if we haul some serious ass, we can stop them and try and change their minds.
let's go. Push it!
okay, I'm starting to have second thoughts.
are you... This was your idea!
I'm serious. This car is fi's baby. If we wreck it, she's gonna be pissed.
Sam, You got a better plan?
no. - Me neither.
stopping an armed convoy is a tactical nightmare.
the easily accessible cars...The ones in the lead and at the tail...
are the ones that don't matter. - Which way you going?
you going right? - Left. I'm going left.
the trick is getting into position to target the key vehicle before anyone realizes what you're doing.
Sam, shut up. Shut up. Shut up! - Pull up a little bit.
there's no real safe way to do it.
send the lead car into a tailspin while inserting yourself into the convoy...
do it!
and you can create your own little roadblock.
move! - Hands...Hands right here. Yep.
no need to shoot anybody. Hey, look, uh, we're not armed.
we just came here to talk. - Oh, well, you've got a funny way of saying hello.
Yeah, hey, that's a good one. Listen, the guy that killed max is on brickell key.
his name is tavian korzha.
sounds like you boys got your story straight, but it's just that a story.
think we'd pull a stunt like that for fun?
we got homeland security to lock the island down and trap the son of a bitch.
Pearce! Listen to me! Listen to me!
we know where this guy is right now!
we could take him down!
just let me make one phone call to set up the meeting.
you owe me that much!
I don't owe you a damn thing! You and your friends are done.
what about max?
what about max's wife?
what do you owe them?
look at me. This is your last chance.
we miss this guy and he gets away...
will you be able to forgive yourself?
I know I won't.
get them in the car.
He...stays with me.
I guess we're going to brickell key.
all right. What did tavian say?
he wants to meet. He's holed up in a half-finished parking garage six blocks from here.
how do you want to play this, agent pearce?
I have a couple options.
the fbi wants to send a negotiator, and I got a cowboy local sheriff ready to send S.W.A.T.On a full-scale assault.
Tavian has the tactical advantage, and he travels heavy.
any direct assault will end up as a bloodbath.
as far as he knows, no one's on to him.
you send me in, i'll bring him out.
what, I give you a gun, send you off by yourself?
you are seriously overestimating my trust in you.
you send me in unarmed. I'll wear a mike.
you can have spotters in the area and a tactical unit on the street watching me.
okay. You're up. But try anything, my teams won't just watch you.
they'll shoot you dead. We clear? - Crystal clear.
they got you, too?
picked me up at the bridge.
I heard what was going on. I asked if I could say goodbye in case...
Hey, an hour ago, I was on my way to jail for the rest of my life.
how much worse is this, really?
the man is ruthless.
he killed one of his own people to avoid capture. You won't even have a gun!
the only way I'm gonna get out of this is if I get tavian to talk.
I can't ask anyone else to risk their life for this.
Michael, come back to me.
come on.
if you're gonna shoot me...
get it over with.
otherwise, let's talk.
finally. I've been waiting for you.
Tavian the man who killed Max.
it's been a busy morning.
your man sam said you'd be here two hours ago.
instead, he has the police seal the island.
he doesn't know who he chooses for an enemy.
you chose us.
you killed our friend and tried to pin it on me.
Yeah. And it didn't stick, did it?
and when I came to kill you, you wouldn't die.
so, here we are. You need me, and I need you.
time to make a deal. - It's too late for that.
it's not just local police down there. It's FBI, CIA. They all know your name.
if you think you're gonna get out of this clean, you're wrong.
you son of a bitch. - You got a choice, tavian.
you surrender peacefully, you give us information, i'll try to keep you out of guantanamo.
but one way or another, this ends today!
well, you're half right.
it does end...For me.
but not for you.
Tavian. Tavian. Tavian, no!
united States of America Federal Building
Pearce, look, I just want to say...
you're free to go. But don't even think about leaving miami.
and when I call, you answer. There might be more questions.
if I had told you the truth from the beginning and you hadn't heard tavian confess, would you really have believed me?
maybe.
we'll never know. - michael!
mom? Agent pearce, this is my mother.
mom, this is...That was agent pearce.
well, that was rude.
what are you doing here?
I was in the neighborhood.
all right, I called, and they told me you were being released.
I thought fi was picking me up. - Yeah, well, I want to talk to you alone.
and you need to hear this.
and fiona and jesse and sam are not gonna tell you.
your friends crashed into a CIA convoy for you.
now, you might want to think about that.
look, when you first came back to miami, you were alone.
God knows you hadn't talked to me in ages.
you had no friends. You lived by yourself.
but that isn't true anymore. You have roots here now.
and when anything happens, it affects all of us.
I know. But it's over now.
is it? - I hope so.
covert operative is one of the most stressful jobs there is.
like soldiers, E.R. Doctors, and astronauts, spies have to schedule extended downtime for decompression.
carry that stress too long, and it's easy to start missing details, like a strange pair of shoes under the crack of your door.
welcome home, kid.
Oh, no gun, huh?
and I thought boy scouts were always prepared.
Larry. I thought you were extradited to an albanian prison.
Oh, I was, but I guess I'm just not done haunting you yet.
Larry, unfriendly ghost- How'd you get out? - The usual. Money. All my money, actually.
I'm down to the felt.
but there's a prison warden in elbasan who's six feet lower than that, so here I am.
don't bother. The crate's empty. I already got your backup gun.
I'll take your phone now.
why are you here, larry? - I got myself a freelance gig.
you're gonna help me break in to the British Consulate right now.
that sounds like a fun way to earn yourself a trip...
to a much more secure penitentiary.
same old michael, always such a pessimist. I've got this all worked out.
see, michael, I brought along some help.
I brought along a very useful, um...
kidnapped guy, kidnapped vic - Kidnappee!
say hello to anson.
Anson useful kidnapped
let's talk inside, shall we?
get him out.
Oh, I see you finally got a woman's touch in here. Or is it fiona?
800-thread-count sheets have their perks.
Flowers...I could take them or leave them.
so, larry, how's this guy gonna help us break in to the british consulate?
go ahead, anson. Explain why I cut your vacation short.
I'm a clinical psychiatrist working for the D.I.A.
he is a government-approved head shrink for spies.
he doles out meds and happy talk for broken toys like you.
the point is, he has high-level clearance across the board.
one of my patients is an american working for the british.
my boss will give us...The access codes if I say I'm worried there's been a leak.
come on, larry. We need more than access codes.
what about building security? What about...
don't ask me. Ask him. He's the expert.
please? This can work. It has to.
he has my wife.
see for yourself, kid.
you see claire's necklace?
that is my insurance policy...
that you are gonna do what I say today.
and I say let's go!
Yeah. It's kind of intimidating, huh?
you know, but we do this right, we go in there like a hot knife through butter.
and you know how I like a hot knife.
3-5-6...2-9-5-1. Thank you.
that's the front door, that's the computer log-in, and that's the vault.
please, just let claire go. - Patience, pal, patience.
if these are right, if they work... - I think we have a problem here.
excuse me! - I don't know what game you think you're playing here, - but believe me, larry plays for keeps. - What? I'm not playing a game.
are you sure? Because when I worked for the british, their access codes were 13 digits.
these are only 12. Are you trying to pull something?
I'm telling the truth. I swear.
kid, seriously, what are you doing here? - Check the access codes online with your phone.
if it's right, you'll be able to log on to the basic site remotely.
cut your way through the backseat.
no cops. Go to the crest hotel. Ask for sam axe.
well, well, well. The codes work.
now who's getting cute? - I'm not the one getting cute.
I was burned for a while. Maybe they changed the codes.
I just don't want to die today, lar.
okay. Okay. You, in the trunk.
we'll be back in an hour.
Hey. Understand something, michael.
you know, I've let you skate a few times just because of old times' sake, and I always looked upon you like a son.
but that ended when you sent me to prison.
now, you don't want to get shot in the neck, you do what I say!
and then you cross your fingers, because daddy is in one of those moods.
you want to tell me why we're breaking in to the british consulate?
are we doing a spec job? Are we stealing something specific?
stop saying "we." There's me, the guy with the gun, and there's you, the guy that does whatever the hell I tell him to do.
this is not some soap box derby.
okay, but but these biohazard symbols on these boxes are making me a little nervous.
well, that's fascinating, michael. Feel free to keep me posted on your feelings.
there are some things you're not gonna get me to do, larry, gun or no.
okay, fine. It's just a cover i. d.
I'm the boss. You're my slow-witted underling.
Oh, and by the way, lose that jacket. It's just a little too fancy.
okay. What's the job? Where do we work?
second floor. That building is a cdc satellite office where larry baruchel was recently hired to test lab samples.
brits are one floor up.
if anson gave us the access codes, why break in through the floor?
because if we open the front door of the consulate, building security gets a heads-up, so we're not opening the front door of the consulate.
what about... - Oh, jesus. You know what?
you're really starting to piss the boss off.
and getting fired around here is the real bitch.
Hey. How's it going, guys? Got a couple of samples to run here.
well, quiet sunday, huh?
you broke our streak. - Yeah.
those are good-looking boys.
Yeah, they take after their dad...Whoever he is.
Oh ho! Nice.
all right. Have a good one.
sorry, need your I.D. too, sir.
Oh, no, uh, he's with me. Chris is with me.
Oh, no, it's not okay, though, 'cause, uh, we got to check the I.D.
but I don't get my I.D.Till thursday 'cause I didn't fill out the paperwork right or something.
Yeah. This is what they stick me with.
uh, it's...Okay. Just sign here and stop by on your way back to sign out.
okay.
there we go.
nice. Slow-witted suits you.
what up, eduardo? - Sorry to make you come down, Mr. Axe.
I know noon to 3: 30 is sam siesta time, but... - No, no, no, that's okay, buddy. It's all right.
who's this guy who wants to see me?
are you sam axe? - Most of the time.
my name's anson fullerton. My...My wife has been taken.
this lunatic strapped a bomb to her neck, and mike...Michael westen?
he said that you might be able to...That you would help.
okay, slow down. One thing at a time.
where is mike now? - He's with this guy. Uh, larry.
they went downtown... - Stop talking. Give me a second.
Fi, it's sam. Hey, we got a problem.
Larry's back.
and who said I'd never get a day job?
okay. Open your box.
inside, you'll find all the tools you need to hack your way up into that vent.
one flight up runs past a hallway connected to the consulate lobby, and that's where you'll be making us a doorway.
all right? Set yourself up.
let me remind you of something, michael.
in two hours, anson's gonna have himself a liquid bride if this doesn't go well.
you got that?
got it. Let's do this.
I like that attitude.
now, before we do any of the heavy lifting,I am gonna buy us a little privacy.
follow my lead.
Hey, guys. Is everything okay up there? - Some kind of warning light just came on.
there's just a little problem with the container tank. It's not Ebola.
here's what we need to do.
call the police, tim. Tim, do you have the sheet with the cdc instructions?
no, no. It is not Ebola. It is just a class-2 spill.
the building is empty, right?
Yeah, you're the only visitors. W-what do you mean, class 2?
Oh, damn it. Damn it.
look, look, we just can't have people coming in and out of here.
you need to lock all the exits.
no phone calls, and that is the emergency-response protocol that we will follow until hazmat gets here, if it comes to that.
you're gonna be hearing a lot of noises, a lot of banging.
that's us looking for that leak. That's normal.
the most important thing is for you guys to just keep your distance.
okay, let's go, let's go, let's go! Lock it up!
come on! Lock it up!
Oh, there's no way anybody's gonna crash our party now.
Jesse, I need you to get maddy out of town. Larry's back.
Larry? How the hell...What is larry doing back in town?
I don't know much, but maddy knows the drill.
the minute you say, "it's a disney world kind of day," she'll grab the shotgun and go.
keep her mind off it, will you? Oh, she loves the teacups.
do you think larry's gonna... - Just breathe. Stay calm.
how am I supposed to stay calm? My wife is...
your wife is gonna be fine.
she's the only thing keeping michael westen from snapping larry's neck, and he knows it.
so, just calm down. Everything's gonna be...
Oh, god.
Sam...I got here 2 minutes ago, and it was too late.
Where's my wife? Where's claire?
I'm sorry. - No, you can't...You said he wouldn't kill her!
Claire! Claire! - anson. Anson, you can't go over there.
Where's my wife? - I'm sorry.
I don't get it. I mean, larry's a monster, but that woman was his only leverage. Why kill her?
it doesn't make any sense.
Anson, look, I know it's hard to focus right now, but the man who killed your wife, he's gonna be out of the country in a matter of hours if you don't help us.
how? What can I do?
you need to tell us everything you know about what larry is doing.
where did he take michael?
I gave him, uh, the codes for the british consulate, the access codes.
look, I don't want to leave you here like this, but sam and I have...
no. If you're going after the son of bitch that killed claire, I'm coming with you.
I want to see him go down.
I want to see him dead.
let's go.
any idea what they feed you in an Albanian prison?
I don't know.
yogurt?
I have no idea.
I ate it every day for 8 months. I still couldn't tell you what it was.
you fishing for an apology, larry?
you gonna let me go if I say I'm sorry I didn't roll over and let you ruin my life?
Nah, I don't suppose so.
well, then, let's do this. - Fine. Up you go.
well, I need a shield for the sparks.
cardboard should do it. I'll check the copy room.
Oh, and go call your friends?
no, I don't think so.
get your ass up there and start cutting.
you'll be fine.
if anyone's used to getting a little burned, it's you.
Level-3 contagion facilities are designed with massive exhaust systems to quickly remove harmful gases in case of an emergency.
they're just about the only type of ventilation shaft a full-grown man can fit into, so they can double as a vertical passageway to the next floor up.
but if you have to make your own exit.
madam, I told you.
I don't care what kind of purse you left upstairs...
it's a Fendi, and it has a very nice reward in it for the handsome guard who saves my life by letting me go grab it.
no one's allowed in today, period.
believe me. I'm doing you a favor.
but...
Larry spooked those guards somehow. The place is locked down tight.
can't you warn the guards? W-won't they help?
look, if we send a couple of rent-a-cops up there...
hell, even if we send a slew of real cops up there...
this is gonna get bloody.
so, that's it? he gets away with it?!
he's not getting away with anything.
we just have to find another way into the building.
my feeling exactly, fi.
look. Check this out. See that?
it's a freight access, but it goes right inside the building.
and under the circumstances...
maybe we should just blast our way in.
Oh, sam...You're finally speaking my language.
what is that?
it's a block of c-4. You should stand back.
Anson, listen. You're gonna stay here, okay?
this is gonna happen fast.
when that door gets opened, we only got one shot to get up there and surprise him.
Michael, are you okay?
Oh, michael is just fine, at least for the moment.
what are you after, larry?
you know, you are probably not the first person I would tell that to, so why don't you do me a favor and hold all your questions till forever?!
now, I have something I want to explain.
I think you know by now I never wanted to kill michael.
touch him, you are dead.
Oh, that is pretty tough talk coming from a tiny, little psychopath in, what are those, capri pants?
where the hell is he?
Hello! Hi, sam. Oh, look at you.
I see jenny craig has done her magic.
thinner but not smarter.
Larry, you got two choices...Whatever you're after or your freedom.
now, you let michael out of there, you can watch us drive way.
you live to fight another day.
if you don't... - Shut up, you gas bag!
this is not a conversation!
this is me telling you...
that if you try anything, I will see you coming, and I will kill him.
believe that.
you know what? He's bluffing.
Larry may be a murderous ghoul, but he's always had a soft spot for mike.
no.
he said,"I never wanted to kill michael.
he's talking about something that hasn't happened, as if it were in the past.
that's never a good sign coming from a sociopath.
what are you saying?
that no matter what we do, he's gonna...
I'm so sorry.
well, you got to love the brits.
about as good at decorating a consulate as they are at holding on to their colonies.
let's just do the job.
you know, a funny thing happened while you were up in that vent.
our buddy anson showed up out front with fi and sam.
I warned you, and I told you not to test me.
now, you are gonna do what I brought you here to do.
and what's that, larry?
you're gonna plant a report in a diplomatic pouch.
a few nice people are gonna rot in prison, and a few million dollars lands in my bank account.
you know, if you want to earn some money,
I can do it without you hurting innocent people.
stop the act, man. Stop it.
I know your holier-than-thou boy scout routine by heart.
and you know what else I know?
I know something that nobody else knows.
you deserved to be burned.
have we forgotten about chechnya?
I didn't do anything in chechnya.
Oh, is that what you tell yourself?
you stood there.
you watched it happen.
you let me kill those people!
and then you helped me cover it up, because that was the job!
Yeah! I did!
I'm just like you, larry!
is that what you want?
you know what I want, michael?
I want you to choose.
you're either a civilian, or you're an operator.
and until you choose...
you're just pathetic.
now, clean yourself up. We got work to do.
watch where you're bleeding, kid.
I'm gonna wipe the security cam so they won't know who came through the wall.
but it won't do any good if you smear your DNA all over their furniture.
here.
where are we planting this?
there's that "we" again.
all right, the outgoing diplomatic pouch is in the vault right over there, and access is remotely controlled from this office right here.
clever.
it makes a break-in a two-man job.
so, you go into the vault.
Oh, oh, and wouldn't you love the chance to have me trapped in an airtight cage?
no. you're going in.
well, then, you'll never know for sure whether I planted the file.
you see these frown lines on my face?
you see, I was not, in fact, born yesterday.
come on. I want to show you something.
I will be watching you the whole way.
now, you go in there. You put the documents in the diplomatic pouch.
you log it in to the computer.
you wait until I buzz you into the vault, then you switch the pouches, and we go home.
got it? - I got it.
let's do this, huh?
Oh, and, michael?
stay out of trouble.
we do rember what happens when you test me, right?
how could I forget?
bingo.
okay.
Bye-bye.
before cellphones were invented, it was much harder to call out to an office without everyone else in the building seeing that you were on the line.
diplomatic spies in the '80s devised an easy solution to the problem...
a corded handset wired to a fax machine gives you the freedom to make calls without showing a line in use.
if you can find a way to hide from the security cameras, you can call out without anyone knowing what you're doing.
I am saying we storm the building, we take out the guards with rubber bullets, - and we go after larry with the real ones! - Fiona...
you are talking about an armed assault of a friendly government consulate, fi!
Oh, please. The british are far from friendly!
I think that... - Come on. Look. If you don't succeed in getting mike killed, the three of us are gonna wind up in prison for the rest of our lives!
Fiona, I think your phone is ringing.
Hello?
Fi, larry knows you're outside.
you got to forget about the consulate and pull back.
if you can get to anson's wife, get her out of that bomb collar and...
Michael, she's dead.
what? No, no, no, no. Why would larry...
whatever larry has planned for you this time, it is not good.
can you run? - No, he's got eyes all over this place.
Yeah, we found that out the hard way. What do you want us to do?
I don't know what you could do.
he'll see any move coming. The windows are bulletproof.
I think I'm just gonna have to plant this file in the vault like he wants and try to undo the damage if I survive.
okay. Okay, great. Stay in the vault.
keep your head down.
Fi, what are you talking about? - Good.
and I'll handle everything else.
Fi, whatever you are planning, you have to walk away.
you can...fi!
michael found us a way in. It's on the east side of the building.
okay. Now we're in business.
we're gonna need the jaws of life to cut through the wall.
there's one on the fire station in brickell.
you two go get that, and I'll keep watch here.
Fi, how's that supposed to go down, exactly? - There's no time to explain, okay?
just go do it! - Okay, okay.
everything will be fine.
uncut RDX, sometimes known as t-4 or cyclonite, is the most powerful military-grade high explosive there is.
it's an incredibly stable solid that can withstand small-arms fire, but when detonated, expands faster than a plasticized formulation like c-4.
simply put, t-4 is the good stuff...
a lethal explosive that creates a wall of fire and shrapnel that will decimate everything and everyone in its path.
Bye-bye.
okay, kid, it's like we were never here. Now, let's make this snappy.
all right, swap out your file for the one in box...
378-baker.
what have we here?
you're gonna have to walk out of there eventually.
I have always admired you, fiona.
I mean, with michael's smarts and your stomach for violence,
I mean, hell, the two of you could almost be me.
Now...now, what part didn't you hear, dear?
this is bulletproof.
go get a. 50 cal...Then maybe you got a shot.
now, listen, I want to do you a favor, fiona.
go home now. Seriously.
you're not gonna want to see the way this ends.
Oh, you're wrong, larry.
I've always wanted to see how this ends.
Oh, god. What was that?
Michael. Oh, god.
Oh, michael.
Oh, thank god.
Fi, why did you plant the bomb in the lobby?
I didn't.
I made one targeted explosive, just enough for larry.
somebody else must have... - The security guards...
they're dead.
I don't understand why larry had bombs in that lobby...
or how my detonator could have set them off.
Sam and jesse are looking into it.
they're trying to make sense of this.
make sense of it?
two innocent people are dead.
you couldn't have known what was going to happen, fi.
Yeah, well, I knew...
how dangerous it could be. That's why I lied to sam.
when he found out what happened, the look on his face...
no one's blaming you for this.
well, they should.
it was my finger on that button. I killed those men.
and cut.
that was really, really great, you two.
the tears，The "i killed those men.
really, really lovely.
how the hell did you get in here?
I borrowed this from fiona's purse while she was consoling me.
dropped a bug in there, too, while I was at it.
you might want to get rid of that. I got what I need.
what the hell is this?
I like to call it leverage.
I hold your girlfriend's fate in my hands.
here's the deal.
the tape is just icing.
I have you blowing up that building six ways from sunday, and if you lay a hand on me, there's a guy who sends a mountain of evidence to the cia and mi6.
I've gone to a lot of trouble to hold all the cards today, and...
that's where we are.
you were behind it all?
behind larry? Behind the consulate?
your wife? - Larry didn't kill his wife.
you don't think i'd actually...
blow up my wife, do you?
who was she? - What kind of question is that?
I don't know. I think her name was "some lady.
the hard part was pulling strings to get larry out of prison.
I couldn't let him know who I was because I had to lead him here and to...
well, me.
but larry was worth it, though.
worth it. I saw his file.
that creepy father/son thing you two had was just what the doctor ordered.
you took quite a big risk, anson.
he could have killed you.
you still don't get it, do you?
I hired him. I hired larry.
he didn't know it, but I've been pulling the strings all along.
no.
there's no way you could have known what would happen back there.
I couldn't? Honey, I really am a very good psychiatrist, but I wouldn't need to be to know that nobody brings out the mad bomber in you like larry.
and a British flag sure wasn't gonna stop you from killing him.
I just added a couple of bombs to the equation.
who the hell are you?
I'm the last one of them.
I'm the man who didn't want to be found, the one you missed in caracas.
after all these years...
that's it? That's it?!
I'm the one who sent tavian to frame you for killing max when you wouldn't leave well enough alone.
stay with me, max.
and I'm the one who watched you tear down every last shred of the organization that burned you.
the organization I spent half my life building.
what do you want from us?!
for starters, I want you to let go of me.
right now.
that's better.
next order of business, in your meeting tomorrow with agent pearce,
I expect you to keep your mouth shut.
after that, we'll talk about all the other things I want from you.
it's a long list.
yogurt parfait. Nice choice.
Max's murder is officially closed.
I'm supposed to tell you that your standing with the agency won't be affected.
and what exactly is my standing with the agency?
you have fans and you have detractors.
let me guess which side you're on.
I do finally get to make the call to max's wife, give that poor woman some closure.
I guess I have you to thank for that.
when you call her, you tell her I was with him at the end.
he said he loved her. You tell her that.
you're a damn good agent, pearce.
maybe I shouldn't say it, but I hope our paths cross again.
what?
Michael, langley wants to keep using a burned spy.
how many people you think they're gonna loop in on something like that?
you're still gonna be my agency contact.
whether either of us likes it or not.
one quick thing before you go.
I don't know if you've noticed, but miami has turned into a bit of a hot spot.
Yeah, I heard about this. Are we on this?
no. The Feds are running point.
But...Keep an ear out, okay?
sure thing.
for a spy, finding out you've been compromised, that someone has something on you, is the ultimate nightmare.
the worst part for someone who has spent a career training for every situation is knowing that there is nothing that you can do but grit your teeth and try to figure out exactly how bad the nightmare is going to be.
I watched you keep it short and sweet with agent pearce today.
I appreciate that I need to know that I can trust you.
you know everything about us.
we don't know a thing about you.
that's true.
once upon a time, I was just a young psychiatrist working for the D.I.A.
it was my job to evaluate the ones who were being reassigned, who were retiring...
the ones who've been burned.
I hated to see that...
talent go to waste.
you were there in the beginning.
it was just me and management, two guys with a dream.
it was a dazzling idea, like a bolt from the blue.
use burned spies to carry out ops that the legitimate intelligence agencies wouldn't touch.
and then came michael westen.
I should have followed my gut.
initially, I opposed your recruitment.
what changed your mind?
something your mother said in one of our sessions.
although, as it turns out, you were less easy to manipulate than she led me to believe.
my mother? What?
I did my homework.
I had to know what makes michael westen tick.
so, about five years ago, I arranged to substitute for madeline's therapist.
she didn't know who she was talking to.
you son of a bitch.
that's an interesting turn of phrase.
funny how that was on the tip of your tongue.
it's your father you should be upset with.
the things that man gave us before he passed away...
what do you want from us?
look at your boyfriend, honey.
he can barely hear a word I'm saying.
well, that's all the time we have for today.
we'll pick this up again in the morning.
enjoy the sunset. It's gonna be getting dark soon.
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing.
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...Family, too... Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate. Someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
Max! What happened? Who did this to you? I don't know - Say goodbye for me. - Max!
whoever did this managed to put a murder weapon in Michael's hands and get away clean.
our killer's in there. We should go in now.
Mike, there's the guy!
Max's killer.
we got to find this guy, and the only thing we got now is a thoroughly toasted computer.
we got to make it fast, Sam. I already talked to Pearce.
she's investigating the warehouse fire. You lied to me. You killed him!
I was framed. He's Romanian. His name is Tavian.
Sam and Jesse are tracking him right now.
just let me make one phone call.
don't even think about it.
come on, Mike. Pick up. Pick up.
this is Michael. Leave a message.
damn it. He's still not answering?
Yeah. Fi said she was with him like 15 minutes ago.
something's not right. Pull over up here.
I want to take a peek at Mike's loft before we get there.
Oh, son of a bitch. It's the Feds.
I had a feeling. Take a look.
I guess Pearce finally caught up with us.
looks like Mike's already in custody.
she's gonna be after us, too.
I'm not ready to say this is over yet. Are you?
well...
what are you thinking? I'm thinking that Pearce is taking Mike to a federal holding facility downtown right now.
now, if we haul some serious ass, we can stop them and try and change their minds.
let's go. Push it!
okay, I'm starting to have second thoughts.
are you -- com-- this was your idea!
I'm serious. This car is Fi's baby.
if we wreck it, she's gonna be pissed. - Sam, you got a better plan?
no. - Me neither.
stopping an armed convoy is a tactical nightmare.
the easily accessible cars -- the ones in the lead and at the tail，are the ones that don't matter.
which way you going? You going right? Left. I'm going left.
the trick is getting into position to target the key vehicle before anyone realizes what you're doing.
Sam, shut up. Shut up. Shut up! - Pull up a little bit.
there's no real safe way to do it.
send the lead car into a tailspin while inserting yourself into the convoy...
do it!
...and you can create your own little roadblock.
move!
hands -- hands right here. Yep. - Hands on your head!
Yep. No need to shoot anybody.
Hey. Hey, look, uh, we're not armed.
we just came here to talk. Oh, well, you've got a funny way of saying hello.
Yeah, hey, that's a good one.
listen, the guy that killed Max is on Brickell Key.
his name is Tavian Korzha.
sounds like you boys got your story straight, but it's just that -- a story.
think we'd pull a stunt like that for fun?
listen to me! Listen to me!
we know where this guy is right now!
we could take him down!
just let me make one phone call to set up the meeting.
you owe me that much!
I don't owe you a damn thing!
you and your friends are done. What about Max?
what about Max's wife?
what do you owe them?
look at me.
this is your last chance.
we miss this guy and he gets away...
will you be able to forgive yourself?
I know I won't.
get them in the car. He...stays with me.
I guess we're going to Brickell Key.
all right. What did Tavian say?
he wants to meet.
he's holed up in a half-finished parking garage six blocks from here.
how do you want to play this, Agent Pearce? I have a couple options.
the FBI wants to send a negotiator, and I got a cowboy local sheriff ready to send S. W.A. T. on a full-scale assault.
Tavian has the tactical advantage, and he travels heavy.
any direct assault will end up as a bloodbath.
as far as he knows, no one's on to him. You send me in, I'll bring him out.
what, I give you a gun, send you off by yourself?
you are seriously overestimating my trust in you.
you send me in unarmed. I'll wear a mike.
you can have spotters in the area and a tactical unit on the street watching me.
okay. You're up.
but try anything, my teams won't just watch you.
they'll shoot you dead. We clear? - Crystal clear.
they got you, too?
picked me up at the bridge.
I heard what was going on.
I asked if I could say goodbye in case...
Hey, an hour ago, I was on my way to jail for the rest of my life.
how much worse is this, really?
the man is ruthless.
he killed one of his own people to avoid capture. You won't even have a gun!
the only way I'm gonna get out of this is if I get Tavian to talk.
I can't ask anyone else to risk their life for this.
Michael, come back to me.
come on.
if you're gonna shoot me... Get it over with.
otherwise, let's talk.
finally.
I've been waiting for you.
Trvian the man who killed max.
it's been a busy morning.
your man Sam said you'd be here two hours ago.
instead, he has the police seal the island.
he doesn't know who he chooses for an enemy.
you chose us.
you killed our friend and tried to pin it on me.
Yeah.
and it didn't stick, did it?
and when I came to kill you, you wouldn't die.
so, here we are. You need me, and I need you.
time to make a deal.
it's too late for that.
it's not just local police down there. It's FBI, CIA. They all know your name.
if you think you're gonna get out of this clean, you're wrong.
you son of a bitch. You got a choice, Tavian.
you surrender peacefully, you give us information,
I'll try to keep you out of Guantanamo.
but one way or another, this ends today!
well, you're half right.
it does end...
for me.
but not for you.
Tavian. Tavian. Tavian, no!
Pearce, look, I just want to say -- you're free to go.
but don't even think about leaving Miami.
and when I call, you answer. There might be more questions.
if I had told you the truth from the beginning and you hadn't heard Tavian confess, would you really have believed me?
maybe.
we'll never know.
mom?
agent Pearce, this is my mother.
mom, this is -- that was Agent Pearce.
well, that was rude. What are you doing here?
I was in the neighborhood.
all right, I called, and they told me you were being released.
I thought Fi was picking me up. Yeah, well, I want to talk to you alone.
and you need to hear this.
and Fiona and Jesse and Sam are not gonna tell you.
your friends crashed into a CIA convoy for you.
now, you might want to think about that.
look, when you first came back to Miami, you were alone.
God knows you hadn't talked to me in ages.
you had no friends. You lived by yourself.
but that isn't true anymore. You have roots here now.
and when anything happens, it affects all of us.
I know.
but it's over now.
is it? I hope so.
covert operative is one of the most stressful jobs there is.
like soldiers, E. R. doctors, and astronauts, spies have to schedule extended downtime for decompression.
carry that stress too long, and it's easy to start missing details, like a strange pair of shoes under the crack of your door.
welcome home, kid.
Oh, no gun, huh?
and I thought boy scouts were always prepared.
I thought you were extradited to an Albanian prison.
Oh, I was, but I guess I'm just not done haunting you yet.
Larry Unfriendly ghost - How'd you get out? - The usual.
money. All my money, actually. I'm down to the felt.
but there's a prison warden in Elbasan who's six feet lower than that, so here I am.
don't bother. The crate's empty. I already got your backup gun.
I'll take your phone now.
why are you here, Larry? I got myself a freelance gig.
you're gonna help me break in to the British Consulate right now.
that sounds like a fun way to earn yourself a trip to a much more secure penitentiary.
same old Michael, always such a pessimist. I've got this all worked out.
see, Michael, I brought along some help.
I brought along a very useful, um...
kidnapped guy, kidnapped vic-- kidnappee!
say hello to Anson.
Anson useful kidnapee.
let's talk inside, shall we? Get him out.
Oh, I see you finally got a woman's touch in here.
or is it Fiona? 800-thread-count sheets have their perks.
flowers -- I could take them or leave them.
so, Larry, how's this guy gonna help us break in to the British Consulate?
go ahead, Anson. Explain why I cut your vacation short.
I'm a clinical psychiatrist working for the D. I.A.
he is a government-approved head shrink for spies.
he doles out meds and happy talk for broken toys like you.
the point is, he has high-level clearance across the board.
one of my patients is an American working for the British.
my boss will give us... the access codes if I say I'm worried there's been a leak.
come on, Larry. We need more than access codes.
what about building security? What about
don't ask me. Ask him. He's the expert.
please? This can work. It has to.
he has my wife.
see for yourself, kid.
you see Claire's necklace?
that is my insurance policy...
that you are gonna do what I say today.
and I say let's go!
Yeah. It's kind of intimidating, huh?
you know, but we do this right, we go in there like a hot knife through butter.
Hey. And you know how I like a hot knife.
2-9-5-1. Thank you.
that's the front door, that's the computer log-in, and that's the vault.
please, just let Claire go.
patience, pal, patience. If these are right, if they work
I think we have a problem here. - Excuse me!
I don't know what game you think you're playing here, but believe me, Larry plays for keeps.
what? I'm not playing a game.
are you sure? Because when I worked for the British, their access codes were 13 digits.
these are only 12. Are you trying to pull something?
I'm telling the truth. I swear.
kid, seriously, what are you doing here?
check the access codes online with your phone.
if it's right, you'll be able to log on to the basic site remotely.
cut your way through the backseat. No cops.
go to the Crest Hotel. Ask for Sam Axe.
well, well, well. The codes work.
now who's getting cute? I'm not the one getting cute.
I was burned for a while. Maybe they changed the codes.
I just don't want to die today, Lar.
okay. Okay. You, in the trunk. We'll be back in an hour.
Hey. Understand something, Michael.
you know, I've let you skate a few times just because of old times' sake, and I always looked upon you like...a son.
but that ended when you sent me to prison.
now, you don't want to get shot in the neck, you do what I say!
and then you cross your fingers, because daddy is in one of those moods.
you want to tell me why we're breaking in to the British Consulate?
are we doing a spec job?
are we stealing something specific? Stop saying "we."
there's me, the guy with the gun, and there's you, the guy that does whatever the hell I tell him to do.
this is not some soapbox derby.
okay, but these biohazard symbols on these boxes are making me a little nervous.
well, that's fascinating, Michael. Feel free to keep me posted on your feelings.
there are some things you're not gonna get me to do, Larry, gun or no.
okay, fine. It's just a cover I. D.
I'm the boss. You're my slow-witted underling. Oh, and by the way, lose that jacket.
it's just a little too fancy.
okay. What's the job? Where do we work?
second floor.
that building is a CDC satellite office where Larry Baruchel was recently hired to test lab samples.
brits are one floor up.
if Anson gave us the access codes, why break in through the floor?
because if we open the front door of the consulate, building security gets a heads-up, so we're not opening the front door of the consulate.
what about -- - Oh, Jesus. You know what?
you're really starting to piss the boss off.
and getting fired around here is the real bitch.
Hey. How's it going, guys?
got a couple of samples to run here.
well, quiet Sunday, huh?
you broke our streak. Yeah.
those are good-looking boys.
Yeah, they take after their dad...whoever he is.
Oh ho! Nice.
all right. Have a good one.
sorry, need your I. D. too, sir.
Oh, no, uh, he's with me. Chris is with me.
Oh, no, it's not okay, though, 'cause, uh, we got to check the I. D.s before
but I don't get my I. D. till Thursday 'cause I didn't fill out the paperwork right or something.
Yeah.
this is what they stick me with.
uh, it's...okay.
just sign here and stop by on your way back to sign out.
right there. - Okay.
there we go.
nice. Slow-witted suits you.
what up, Eduardo?
sorry to make you come down, Mr. Axe.
I know noon to 3: 30 is Sam siesta time, but
no, no, no, that's okay, buddy. It's all right.
who's this guy？who wants to see me?
are you Sam Axe? Most of the time.
my name's Anson Fullerton. My...
my wife has been taken.
this lunatic strapped a bomb to her neck, and Mike
michael Westen?
he said that you might be able to -- that you would help.
okay, slow down. One thing at a time. Where is Mike now?
he's with this guy. Uh, Larry.
they went downtown -- stop talking. Give me a second.
Fi, it's Sam. Hey, we got a problem.
Larry's back.
and who said I'd never get a day job?
okay. Open your box.
inside, you'll find all the tools you need to hack your way up into that vent.
one flight up runs past a hallway connected to the consulate lobby, and that's where you'll be making us a doorway.
all right? Set yourself up.
let me remind you of something, Michael.
in two hours, Anson's gonna have himself a liquid bride if this doesn't go well. You got that?
got it. Let's do this.
I like that attitude.
now, before we do any of the heavy lifting,
I am gonna buy us a little privacy.
follow my lead.
Hey, guys. Is everything okay up there?
some kind of warning light just came on.
there's just a little problem with the container tank.
it's not ebola. Here's what we need to do. Call the police, Tim.
Tim, do you have the sheet with the CDC instructions?
no, no. It is not ebola. It is just a Class-2 spill.
the building is empty, right?
Yeah, y-you're the only visitors.
W-what do you mean, Class 2? - Oh, damn it. Damn it.
look, look, we just can't have people coming in and out of here.
you need to lock all the exits.
no phone calls, and that is the emergency-response protocol that we will follow until Hazmat gets here, if it comes to that.
you're gonna be hearing a lot of noises, a lot of banging.
that's us looking for that leak. That's normal.
the most important thing is for you guys to just keep your distance.
okay, let's go, let's go, let's go! Lock it up!
come on! Lock it up!
Oh, there's no way anybody's gonna crash our party now.
Jesse, I need you to get Maddy out of town.
Larry's back.
Larry? How the hell
what is Larry doing back in town? I don't know much, but Maddy knows the drill.
the minute you say, "It's a Disney World kind of day,"
she'll grab the shotgun and go.
keep her mind off it, will you? Oh, she loves the teacups.
Sam, you're scaring me. Do you think Larry's gonna -- Just breathe. Stay calm.
how am I supposed to stay calm? My wife is -- Your wife is gonna be fine.
she's the only thing keeping Michael Westen from snapping Larry's neck, and he knows it.
so, just calm down. Everything's gonna be
Oh, God.
Sam...I got here 2 minutes ago, and it was too late.
Where's my wife? Where's Claire? I'm sorry.
no, you can't -- you said he wouldn't kill her!
Anson, you can't go over there.
Where's my wife? - I'm sorry.
I don't get it.
I mean, Larry's a monster, but that woman was his only leverage.
why kill her? It doesn't make any sense.
Anson, look, I know it's hard to focus right now, but the man who killed your wife, he's gonna be out of the country in a matter of hours if you don't help us.
how? What can I do?
you need to tell us everything you know about what Larry is doing.
where did he take Michael?
I gave him, uh, the codes for the British Consulate, the access codes.
look, I don't want to leave you here like this, but Sam and I have -- - No. If you're going after the son of bitch that killed Claire, I'm coming with you.
I want to see him go down. I want to see him dead.
let's go.
any idea what they feed you in an Albanian prison?
I don't know. Yogurt? I have no idea.
I ate it every day for 8 months. I still couldn't tell you what it was.
you fishing for an apology, Larry?
you gonna let me go if I say I'm sorry
I didn't roll over and let you ruin my life?
Nah, I don't suppose so. Well, then, let's do this.
fine. Up you go.
well, I need a shield for the sparks.
cardboard should do it. I'll check the copy room.
Oh, and go call your friends? No, I don't think so.
get your ass up there and start cutting.
you'll be fine.
if anyone's used to getting a little burned, it's you.
Level-3 contagion facilities are designed with massive exhaust systems to quickly remove harmful gases in case of an emergency.
they're just about the only type of ventilation shaft a full-grown man can fit into, so they can double as a vertical passageway to the next floor up.
but if you have to make your own exit.
ma'am, I told you.
I don't care what kind of purse you left upstairs
it's a Fendi, and it has a very nice reward in it for the handsome guard who saves my life by letting me go grab it. No one's allowed in today, period.
believe me. I'm doing you a favor.
but
Larry spooked those guards somehow.
the place is locked down tight.
can't you warn the guards? W-w-won't they help?
look, if we send a couple of Rent-A-Cops up there
hell, even if we send a slew of real cops up there
this is gonna get bloody.
so, that's it? Wh-- he gets away with it?!
he's not getting away with anything.
we just have to find another way into the building.
my feeling exactly, Fi. Look. Check this out.
see that? It's a freight access, but it goes right inside the building. And under the circumstances...
maybe we should just blast our way in.
Oh, Sam...
you're finally speaking my language.
what is that?
it's a block of C-4. You should stand back.
Anson, listen.
you're gonna stay here, okay? This is gonna happen fast.
when that door gets opened, we only got one shot to get up there and surprise him.
Michael, are you okay?
Oh, Michael is just fine, at least for the moment.
what are you after, Larry?
you know, you are probably not the first person
I would tell that to, so why don't you do me a favor and hold all your questions till forever?!
now, I have something I want to explain.
I think you know by now I never wanted to kill Michael.
touch him, you are dead.
Oh, that is pretty tough talk coming from a tiny, little psychopath in, what are those, Capri pants?
where the hell is he?
Hello!
Hi, Sam. Oh, look at you.
I see Jenny Craig has done her magic.
thinner but not smarter.
Larry, you got two choices -- whatever you're after or your freedom.
now, you let Michael out of there, you can watch us drive way.
you live to fight another day. If you don't
shut up, you gas bag! This is not a conversation!
this is me telling you...
that if you try anything, I will see you coming, and I will kill him.
believe that.
you know what? He's bluffing.
Larry may be a murderous ghoul, but he's always had a soft spot for Mike.
no.
he said, "I never wanted to kill Michael."
he's talking about something that hasn't happened, as if it were in the past.
that's never a good sign coming from a sociopath.
what are you saying? That no matter what we do, he's gonna...
I'm so sorry.
well, you got to love the Brits.
about as good at decorating a consulate as they are at holding on to their colonies.
let's just do the job. - You know, a funny thing happened while you were up in that vent.
our buddy Anson showed up out front with Fi and Sam.
I warned you, and I told you not to test me.
now, you are gonna do what I brought you here to do.
and what's that, Larry?
you're gonna plant a report in a diplomatic pouch.
a few nice people are gonna rot in prison, and a few million dollars lands in my bank account.
you know, if you want to earn some money,
I can do it without you hurting innocent people.
stop the act, man. Stop it.
I know your holier-than-thou Boy Scout routine by heart.
and you know what else I know? I know something that nobody else knows.
you deserved to be burned.
have we forgotten about Chechnya?
I didn't do anything in Chechnya.
Oh. Oh, is that what you tell yourself?
you stood there. You watched it happen.
you let me kill those people!
and then you helped me cover it up, because that was the job!
Yeah! I did! I'm just like you, Larry!
is that what you want?
you know what I want, Michael?
I want you to choose.
you're either a civilian, or you're an operator.
and until you choose...
you're just pathetic.
now, clean yourself up.
we got work to do.
watch where you're bleeding, kid.
I'm gonna wipe the security cam so they won't know who came through the wall.
but it won't do any good if you smear your DNA all over their furniture.
here.
where are we planting this?
there's that "we" again.
all right, the outgoing diplomatic pouch is in the vault right over there, and access is remotely controlled from this office right here.
clever. It makes a break-in a two-man job.
so, you go into the vault.
Oh, oh, and wouldn't you love the chance to have me trapped in an airtight cage?
no. You're going in.
well, then, you'll never know for sure whether I planted the file.
you see these frown lines on my face?
you see, I was not, in fact, born yesterday.
come on. I want to show you something.
I will be watching you the whole way.
now, you go in there.
you put the documents in the diplomatic pouch.
you log it in to the computer.
you wait until I buzz you into the vault, then you switch the pouches, and we go home.
got it? - I got it.
let's do this, huh? Oh, and, Michael?
stay out of trouble.
we do remember what happens when you test me, right?
how could I forget?
bingo.
okay.
Bye-bye.
before cellphones were invented, it was much harder to call out to an office without everyone else in the building seeing that you were on the line.
diplomatic spies in the '80s devised an easy solution to the problem
a corded handset wired to a fax machine gives you the freedom to make calls without showing a line in use.
if you can find a way to hide from the security cameras, you can call out without anyone knowing what you're doing.
I am saying we storm the building, we take out the guards with rubber bullets, and we go after Larry with the real ones!
Fiona... - You are talking about an armed assault of a friendly government consulate, Fi! - Oh, please.
the British are far from friendly! - Come on. Look.
I think that -- if you don't succeed in getting Mike killed, the three of us are gonna wind up in prison for the rest of our lives! Fiona, I think your phone is ringing.
Hello? Fi, Larry knows you're outside.
you got to forget about the consulate and pull back.
if you can get to Anson's wife, get her out of that bomb collar and
Michael, she's dead.
what?
no, no, no, no. Why would Larry
whatever Larry has planned for you this time, it is not good.
can you run? No, he's got eyes all over this place.
Yeah, we found that out the hard way.
what do you want us to do? I don't know what you could do.
he'll see any move coming. The windows are bulletproof.
I think I'm just gonna have to plant this file in the vault like he wants and try to undo the damage if I survive.
okay. Okay, great.
stay in the vault. Keep your head down. Fi, what are you talking about?
good. And I'll handle everything else.
Fi, whatever you are planning, you have to walk away.
you can-- Fi!
michael found us a way in.
it's on the east side of the building. Okay. Now we're in business.
we're gonna need the jaws of life to cut through the wall.
there's one on the fire station in Brickell. You two go get that, and I'll keep watch here.
Fi, how's that supposed to go down, exactly?
there's no time to explain, okay? Just go do it!
okay, okay. - Everything will be fine.
uncut RDX, sometimes known as T-4 or cyclonite, is the most powerful military-grade high explosive there is.
it's an incredibly stable solid that can withstand small-arms fire, but when detonated, expands faster than a plasticized formulation like C-4.
simply put, T-4 is the good stuff
a lethal explosive that creates a wall of fire and shrapnel that will decimate everything and everyone in its path.
Bye-bye.
okay, kid, it's like we were never here. Now, let's make this snappy.
all right, swap out your file for the one in box...
378-Baker.
what have we here?
you're gonna have to walk out of there eventually.
I have always admired you, Fiona.
I mean, with Michael's smarts and your stomach for violence,
I mean, hell, the two of you could almost be me.
now -- now, what part didn't you hear, dear?
this is bulletproof.
go get a 50 cal -- then maybe you got a shot.
now, listen, I want to do you a favor, Fiona.
go home now. Seriously.
you're not gonna want to see the way this ends. Oh, you're wrong, Larry.
I've always wanted to see how this ends.
Oh, God.
what was that? Michael.
Oh, God.
Oh, thank God.
Fi, why did you plant the bomb in the lobby?
I didn't.
I made one targeted explosive, just enough for Larry.
somebody else must have
the security guards -- they're dead.
I don't understand why Larry had bombs in that lobby...
or how my detonator could have set them off.
Sam and Jesse are looking into it. They're trying to make sense of this.
make sense of it?
two innocent people are dead.
you couldn't have known what was going to happen, Fi.
Yeah, well, I knew...
how dangerous it could be.
that's why I lied to Sam.
when he found out what happened, the look on his face...
no one's blaming you for this. Well, they should.
it was my finger on that button.
I killed those men.
and cut.
that was really, really great, you two.
the tears...
the "I killed those men." Really, really lovely.
how the hell did you get in here?
I...borrowed this from Fiona's purse while she was consoling me.
dropped a bug in there, too, while I was at it.
you might want to get rid of that.
I got what I need. What the hell is this?
I like to call it leverage.
I hold your girlfriend's fate in my hands.
here's the deal.
the tape...is just icing.
I have you blowing up that building six ways from Sunday,
I've gone to a lot of trouble to hold all the cards today, and...that's where we are. You were behind it all?
behind Larry?
behind the consulate?
your wife? Larry didn't kill his wife.
you don't think I'd actually... blow up my wife, do you?
who was she?
what kind of question is that? I don't know.
I think her name was "some lady."
the hard part was pulling strings to get Larry out of prison.
I couldn't let him know who I was because I had to lead him here and to...well, me.
but Larry was worth it, though.
worth it. I saw his file.
that creepy father/son thing you two had was just what the doctor ordered.
you took quite a big risk, Anson. He could have killed you.
you still don't get it, do you?
I hired him. I hired Larry.
he didn't know it, but I've been pulling the strings all along.
no. There's no way you could have known what would happen back there.
I couldn't?
honey, I really am a very good psychiatrist, but I wouldn't need to be to know that nobody brings out the mad bomber in you like Larry.
and a British flag sure wasn't gonna stop you from killing him.
I just added a couple of bombs to the equation.
who the hell are you?
I'm the last one of them.
I'm the man who didn't want to be found, the one you missed in Caracas.
after all these years...
that's it? Hey. Hey.
that's it?!
I'm the one who sent Tavian to frame you for killing Max when you wouldn't leave well enough alone.
stay with me, Max.
and I'm the one who watched you tear down every last shred of the organization that burned you.
the organization I spent half my life building.
what do you want from us?!
for starters, I want you to let go of me.
right now.
that's better.
next order of business, in your meeting tomorrow with Agent Pearce,
I expect you to keep your mouth shut.
after that, we'll talk about all the other things I want from you.
it's a long list.
yogurt parfait. Nice choice.
Max's murder is officially closed. I'm supposed to tell you that your standing with the Agency won't be affected.
and what exactly is my standing with the Agency?
you have fans and you have detractors.
let me guess which side you're on.
I do finally get to make the call to Max's wife, give that poor woman some closure.
I guess I have you to thank for that.
when you call her, you tell her I was with him at the end.
he said he loved her. You tell her that.
you're a damn good agent, Pearce.
maybe I shouldn't say it, but I hope our paths cross again.
what?
Michael, Langley wants to keep using a burned spy.
how many people you think they're gonna loop in on something like that?
you're still gonna be my agency contact.
whether either of us likes it or not.
one quick thing before you go.
I don't know if you've noticed, but Miami has turned into a bit of a hot spot.
Yeah, I heard about this. Are we on this?
no. The FED are running point.
But...keep an ear out, okay? Sure thing.
for a spy, finding out you've been compromised, that someone has something on you, is the ultimate nightmare.
the worst part for someone who has spent a career training for every situation is knowing that there is nothing that you can do but grit your teeth and try to figure out exactly how bad the nightmare is going to be.
I watched you keep it short and sweet with Agent Pearce today.
I appreciate that. I need to know that I can trust you.
you know everything about us. We don't know a thing about you.
it's true.
once upon a time, I was just a young psychiatrist working for the D. I.A.
it was my job to evaluate the ones who were being reassigned, who were retiring...
the ones who've been burned.
I hated to see that...talent go to waste.
you were there in the beginning.
it was just me and management, two guys with a dream.
it was a dazzling idea, like a bolt from the blue.
use burned spies to carry out OPS that the legitimate intelligence agencies wouldn't touch.
and then came Michael Westen. I should have followed my gut.
initially, I opposed your recruitment. What changed your mind?
something your mother said in one of our sessions.
although, as it turns out, you were less easy to manipulate than she led me to believe.
my mother? What? I did my homework.
I had to know what makes Michael Westen tick.
so, about five years ago,
I arranged to substitute for Madeline's therapist.
she didn't know who she was talking to. You son of a bitch.
that's an interesting turn of phrase.
funny how that was on the tip of your tongue. It's your father you should be upset with.
the things that man gave us before he passed away...
what do you want from us? Look at your boyfriend, honey.
he can barely hear a word I'm saying.
well, that's all the time we have for today.
we'll pick this up again in the morning.
enjoy the sunset. It's gonna be getting dark soon.
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing...No cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am i? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...- Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies. A bunch of bitchy little girls.
...Family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, michael.
bottom line - As long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
Max's murder is officially closed.
I'm supposed to tell you that your standing with the agency won't be affected.
and what exactly is my standing with the agency?
you have fans and you have detractors.
let me guess which side you're on.
you're gonna help me break in to the british consulate.
I brought along some help.
say hello to anson.
I never wanted to kill michael.
touch him, you are dead.
I told you not to test me.
my wife has been taken. This lunatic strapped a bomb to her neck.
you said he wouldn't kill her!
we take out the guards with rubber bullets, and we go after larry with the real ones!
you are talking about an armed assault of a friendly government consulate, Fi!
the three of us are gonna wind up in prison for the rest of our lives!
this is bulletproof. Go get a 50 cal - Then maybe you got a shot.
Oh, god.
Fi, why did you plant the bomb in the lobby?
I didn't. I made one targeted explosive, just enough for larry.
the security guards - They're dead.
I've gone to a lot of trouble to hold all the cards today.
Larry didn't kill his wife.
you don't think i'd actually... Blow up mywife.
I have you blowing up that building six ways from sunday.
I like to call it leverage. I hold your girlfriend's fate in my hands.
who the hell are you? - I'm the last one of them.
I've been pulling the strings all along.
for a spy, the worst thing that can happen is to become someone else's asset.
you do anything you can to avoid it, making sure there's nothing people can grab onto and use as leverage.
you move through life unattached, keeping the world at a distance.
it's a hard way to live, but there's a cold logic to it.
love nothing, and nothing you love can be used against you.
once you violate that rule and make that connection with someone, you've handed your enemies the key to destroying you.
I want to get the ball rolling on your security review.
question one
I'd like to ask the first question, actually.
the fact that i'm being evaluated for a higher clearance, does that mean that，
all this means is that D.C. Likes having someone who can work off the books.
last time I checked, that was illegal. - It pushes the boundaries.
but I'd say, in light of your recent activities, you're in no position to be too squeamish about laws.
after all, that's what they like about you.
Oh, and one more thing.
just rember that a team of agents is going to quadruple-check everything you say here today.
so do yourself a favor. Stick to the truth for a change.
question one.
Mr. Westen, we're aware of your past affiliation with a rogue network of burned spies.
to the best of your knowledge, does any trace of that network still exist?
no.
all of that's over now.
you're late. I was starting to worry. How'd your meeting go?
none of your business.
Oh, but it is. It is. It is absolutely my business because while there may be some doubt about whether you work for the CIA, there's absolutely no doubt that you work for me.
so, I will ask again. How did your meeting go?
it went fine.
what do you want?
see, I have a problem.
I spent most of my career staying... Well, invisible, off the radar.
and then you started shing lights in dark corners that should have stayed dark.
and now, as a result of your efforts, my bank accounts and other bits of personal information are in cia computers, and I don't want them there.
that's already done. There's nothing I can do.
Oh, don't be such a pessimist. Of course there is.
have you ever heard of voidbot?
it's this nifty little bit of malware that can scrub all trace of a person off of a computer system undetectably.
I want you to get to the man who created it and get us a copy.
his name's oswald patterson.
hold on. He's in puerto rico?
sorry, I can't travel. The CIA's watching me too closely.
I saw your psych eval.
I know you can do anything you set your mind to.
or, in this case, anything set your mind to.
don't do it for me, mikey. Do it for love.
do it for Fiona.
forget it.
I don't think you should do anything for that parasite.
I don't think I have a choice.
of course you have a choice. You can say no.
you can tell the CIA all about Anson and......
and watch you go to jail for the rest of your life for something you didn't do?
I can't do that, Fi.
uh, okay. Uh, what do we got here? What's the plan?
I don't think there is one.
I got have to go to puerto rico and grab the guy we need to get anson his virus.
well, then I'm going with you. - Fi.
I'm not some damsel in distress, Michael.
have you read that file?
this hacker that you're after has his own little private army of bodyguards.
we'll both go, then.
okay, well, while you're doing that, someone should check and see what the police know about Fi.
I don't care how many cop buddies you have, sam.
you can't just go in there and ask about - I wasn't planning on that.
I got a thing, a little something Jesse and me cooked up.
but, uh, the thing is, it's gonna take someone who can fly under the radar.
someone we trust. Someone who knows the deal, you know? I don't know.
you know, maybe someone who's... A little older.
my mom, Sam? - Mike, what a great idea. I'll talk to her.
here's to good plans in bad situations.
you want me to steal what?
listen, it's not really stealing. It's more like, uh, uh, borrowing without asking.
Yes.
borrowing without asking from the police.
isn't this just gonna get michael in even more trouble?
well, no, see, since I set you up with this sweet, little fake ID.
so it won't lead back to him or you.
this thing lists me at age 52.
Yeah, well, you know, a good cover ID Lists the age that you look, not the age you are.
and a good spy knows how to flatter. Fine, I'll do it.
and may I ask, where is Michael?
I it's, uh - where is he? He's on a trip.
trip. - That's it.
whatever.
when operating without official cover in remote locations, you don't have resources or backup if things go wrong.
so it's usually best to move fast and stay exposed for as little time as possible.
it's just a matter of figuring out what you're up against, crossing your fingers, and getting in and out as quickly as you can.
well, Oswald sure knows how to stay protected.
I count four armed guards covering just the rear of the compound.
Michael, you're sure you want to do this now?
we could wait and see what Sam and Jesse find.
I mean, if I'm past saving, what's the point?
we have to assume we can get you out of this. - What if we can't?
I've been past saving before, Fi.
you didn't walk away, and I'm not going to.
well, that's terribly romantic, michael.
but we don't have the numbers nor the firepower to get through those guards.
maybe we can get around them.
if you set a diversion out front,
I can make an approach from the water, grab Oswald before anyone even knows I'm there.
please, Fi.
don't look at me like that. It's unsettling when you're that sincere.
fine, yes. I'll get the guns.
creating a good diversion isn't just about making noise and firing guns.
it's about giving the enemy the impression that he's being attacked by a force that demands the immediate attention of all his forces.
ideally, something big and very, very loud.
Michael, the window's open.
all right, fi. I'll meet you a mile up on the beach.
just go! Go, go, go! Get out there!
what am I paying you for?! Go! Go!
shh, shh, shh! Don't move. Don't make a sound.
Oh, my god.
tie your hands. Tie your hands!
get up. Get up!
you need to learn to follow directions.
be quiet.
is this about money? Because I have money.
this is about software. - Software?
you got some bad information, man. I - I don't know anything about software.
well, then we need to go to miami.
no, no, no. No, no. We can't go to miami.
listen, let's talk about it.
Oh, please, please! You're making a mistake, okay?
my name is carlos buel. Check my wallet.
Carlos is the cover I.D. The government gave you.
your real name is Oswald Patterson.
I cannot swim with my hands tied!
you're not swimming.
you're gonna float.
praying isn't gonna help the situation.
praying? That's cute.
I'm actually playing chess.
it's not that easy to keep a board straight in your head, so if you wanted to leave me alone, i'd really appreciate it.
happy to as soon as I get the voidbot software.
well... Okay, maybe you should write this down so I don't have to keep repeating myself.
but I don't have it!
Oswald, you can't just keep lying to me forever.
okay, well, I am not talking.
unstoppable force, meet immovable object.
fine.
let's just forget it.
uh, uh, before we start torturing each other, all right, can we just talk about this?
my guards saw you abduct me!
you are actually right, oswald. I owe you an apology.
I owe you an apology... - No, no.
cause I feel like I have made a terrible mistake.
what mistake? No. Please!
let's go for a walk.
so, what now?
I let you go, oswald.
okay, good. I think that's a good choice.
you didn't - I'm sorry. Who are you calling?
the police to confess that I kidnapped you. That's patterson with two t's, right?
Oh, no, no. That's not - That's not necessary.
no, everyone needs to know that you're safe and here in miami.
I think I'm gonna call the herald. You know, the newspapers.
stop! Stop, okay? Just stop.
do you know what kind of people live on islands?
in heavily guarded homes under fake names?
hunted people, Oswald.
so if you want me to let you go and you take your chances with your enemies, fine.
otherwise, tell me where the virus is.
all right, can we sit? Please? Can we...
so a little bit of history.
my specialty was hacking financial systems.
so one day I got a call from this guy named Xavier.
he's a cocaine I don't know Wholesaler, I guess?
he wants to go all cash and needs my help to, uh, erase his name from international, uh, banking systems.
uh, pays $10 million $5 million up front,$5 million on delivery.
to write this program to erase all of his information from the government's computers.
that was voidbot. - Yeah.
the problem is, before I can deliver it, I get busted by the FBI.
so I made a deal, the Feds confiscated the program...
and now it's stuck in a lab? - See, well, that's the thing, though.
I've got a way in. I built a back door for myself.
uh, key cards, access codes just to get in in case, um, I need to.
uh, I left that stuff with uh, a - an associate?
I guess it's time to get in touch with this associate.
no - What's up, Sam?
Oh, just checking to see how things are going with your hacker buddy.
we're making progress. - Well, that's good.
so, listen, uh, me and Jesse are about to start teaching your ma some spy craft.
just wanted to make sure everything's still a go.
it's a go, Sam. - You got it, Mikey.
okay, all systems are go.
I pulled some strings, got a meeting with the detective working the consulate bombing.
you're gonna get us access to his laptop so we can see if they're after Fi.
how am I gonna do that? I barely know how to turn this thing on.
you're gonna get the data off the DRAM chip.
dynamic random access memory. Basically, it's a circuit.
spare me the computer talk. Just show me what to do.
okay. Watch and learn.
information stored in a dram chip was long considered impossible to steal.
it's automatically erased when the chip's removed.
and then after you transfer the information, you have to get the chip back in the laptop.
okay, so, your turn. The whole thing, the whole bit.
don't rush me.
the one way to preserve the information in a DRAM chip is by freezing it immediately after you take it out of the computer.
a quick application of compressed air from your local drug store will keep the memory intact long enough to get what you need.
that's - that's plenty.
it's possible, but far from easy.
and if you don't want to get caught, it takes some practice.
there! I did it!
okay, good. Now you have to do it until you can do it under pressure without these.
they're not gonna let you smoke in there, Maddy.
fine. If I can't smoke, you can't drink my beer.
let's do it again.
Yeah, I heard you guys were looking for anybody that knew anything about the consulate bomb.
I used to be with CIFA, so I figured i'd try to pitch in.
I see. How did you two cross paths?
Oh, Jesse's girlfriend does my hair.
um, and, so, I was talking about what I saw, and he gave me a call and said that I should get in touch with you.
Yeah, my lady made me tag along for support. You know how it is.
I understand. This is our stop.
miss Brown, did you notice anything else unusual or out of the ordinary on your walk that afternoon?
uh, no... Not really.
would you mind looking through some mug shots?
just to see if you recognize anybody?
whew, gosh. That's a lot.
Oh, uh, take your time. Take your time.
I'd never forgive myself.
you know what? Why don't we go grab a soda?
give her a little breathing room, huh?
sure.
we'll be right back. - Thank you.
when you need to buy time for an operation, the key is staying relaxed.
no matter how high the stakes are, you have to act like everything's fine.
diet or regular? - Uh... Let's go full diesel.
I deserve a little treat. I've been doing these new crunches.
there's this new ab workout. It's called "crunch drunk." You heard of it?
no. - Dude. It's hardcore.
feel my stomach.
the key is staying natural, giving your team as much room to operate as you can without letting on to what you're doing.
we should be getting back. - Actually, you know what?
let's go with... Cherry soda.
feeling a little crazy. Feeling a little wacky.
okay. - No, scratch that.
let's go diet. Diet. Okay.
when you know that time is running out, you have to signal your team at the first opportunity and hope for the best.
so, uh - so how about you, detective? Do you hit the gym at all?
Oh, I curl donuts.
lots of donuts.
excuse me, ma'am? May I ask what you're doing?
putting something in your purse there? You want to tell me what that is?
caught me.
it's my cigarettes. Trying to sneak one.
sorry. - I'll tell you what. I'll... Pretend like I didn't see it.
thank you. - There you go.
you see anybody you recognize?
I think - I think I remember this man.
um... Or maybe that's him.
this one.
Yeah. I really can't be sure.
you know what? Um... I think we got all we need.
thanks for coming in.
that's it. Yellow one.
this is where your "associate" lives?
care to elaborate on this associate? - Uh, no, actually, thank you.
I do not care to elaborate on this associate.
I care to get in, get my access cards, and get out as soon as possible.
touchy, touchy.
he has enemies. Don't take it personally.
actually, you can take that personally.
you are both firmly in the "enemy" column right now.
baby cakes! Hey. You look great.
you look like hammered crap.
just get inside, Oswald.
I'll deal with this. You keep an eye on the street, baby cakes.
Oh, love what you've done here. Very tech-geek chic.
baby cakes, um, where's that tv?
the one I bought you? The vintage? - That dinosaur?
no, I'm streaming everything through these bad boys.
see, they get 100 times the resolution.
why um, wouldn't... You tell me that you stopped using that television?
the only contact we have these days is when we're questing in "world of warcraft.
why would I tell you how I'm decorating my living room?
that tv is extremely important!
do not tell me - Well, you didn't say it was important!
you just sent it to me with a card that said, "happy birthday.
this is your problem, Oswald!
we're gonna have to deal with your issues later.
right now, I need to know where those cards are.
the cards are in the television that I gave her.
I thought it would be a good idea to hide them somewhere in miami in case I need to get to them.
where is the tv now? - In storage.
a place across town. I have a key, but...
Michael. - Did you get the key cards?
no. We hit a little snag in here.
well, we're about to hit a big snag out here.
two armored S. U.V. s are headed this way.
I think Oswald's friend xavier just caught up to us.
meet me at the side of the house - now.
can either of you tell me why the coke dealer that you pissed off just showed up?
what did you do? - I'm so sorry, Ozzy.
Oh, no. - You promised that he wouldn't find me, but he did.
and he said if you ever came back and I didn't tell him, I was dead.
I'm so sorry. I screwed this whole thing up.
this is gonna have to wait.
we need to move right now, or we're all gonna die right here.
we got another S. U.V. Coming up third.
the street is completely blocked. - Three guys in the back alley, too. This is bad.
you guys, we're dead. We are dead! - Calm down.
look, xavier wants the software, so he's probably planning on taking you alive.
and that's a good thing? - Yeah, it gives us a way out of here.
one you're not gonna like, though.
all right, fan out.
I don't want the little weasel popping out a window and making a run for it.
in a situation where you're trying to keep someone from being captured, your best leverage is often the life of the very person you're trying to protect.
everybody back off...or I drop him right now.
the trick is convincing the bad guys that you're willing to kill their prize before you let them have it.
Xavier, I presume.
nice suit. - Thanks.
but we've got a big problem here.
feel like telling me who you are? - That's not important.
what is important is that you need this man alive and I do not.
put down your weapons or he dies.
come on! - The next one's in his skull.
drop your weapon now.
very good.
this is a mistake. You don't want to make me your enemy.
and you don't want to make me make him a corpse.
back off, friend.
you better keep him in one piece. He's mine.
and whoever you are... I'll see you soon.
Oh god. This isn't good.
are you sure Xavier can't find us? - We're safe here.
Michael's checking with some of our contacts to see how wide Xavier's reach is.
I can tell you it's wide enough to relocate to puerto rico.
you know, maybe it's time we consider - You're staying in miami until we get those key cards.
sherry, you're sure the TV's still in your storage unit?
Yeah, yeah. And I have the only key, so the TV is still inside.
well, at this point, xavier knows you're part of this.
chances are he knows you're renting a storage unit.
um, you know, Sherry didn't sign up for any of this.
is there a way we can just get her out of town or...?
well, I have an import/export friend maybe he could help.
Import/export? - That means smuggling.
that's how they got me here.
you like boats?
that's my friend, Louis. He'll take you to the dominican republic.
is Oswald gonna be okay? - I think so.
he's in trouble, but michael's good with trouble.
you probably think I'm crazy for liking Oswald but do you know how we met?
I cracked his online account at a music store and stole his credit card.
he tracked me down and asked me out.
there aren't a lot of guys like that.
it's not ideal, but I kind of can't help but love him.
you'll take care of him, then? - We'll do our best.
bon voyage!
so, you find anything? - uh, not yet.
beer. And a single malt scotch.
um, yeah, no. I'm sorry. That's a mistake. We didn't order that.
it's from the gentleman over there.
Anson, great to see you. What do you want?
did I - did I get your drinks right? yes?
I'm so happy.
mm, look who's been doing research! Checking into what the police have on Fiona.
good for you. It's always best to see for yourself.
but may I save you some time with the executive summary?
the police hit a dead-end tracking the explosives.
the surveillance cameras turned up nothing, and there were no eyewitnesses.
the investigation's at a standstill. Yeah, we got that.
Oh, that's a half-empty way of looking at it, Mr. Porter.
I prefer to think that the police are a few missing clues away from solving the case.
clues which I currently hold. - Goody for you.
well, it will be when I get the software that I asked for.
Yeah, Mike's working on that. - Wonderful.
please tell him that Fiona's completely safe so long as he succeeds.
Oh, and in case either of you have any ideas about, um, coming after me, please be aware I know a lot more about you than your favorite drinks.
Cheers.
it's official. The guy's a dick.
hands on the pipe, Oswald.
Seriously?
aren't we past the whole zip cord phase?
I don't like going into dark corners with people I don't trust.
aren't we just picking up the access cards? - We are.
if it helps, think of yourself as a lookout, in case Xavier sends someone here.
what are the chances xavier - Very high, and we already know you like yelling.
so if you see his guys, do what comes naturally.
Mike! They're here!
where you going? Hey, where you going?
you're leaving me?! You're leaving me here?
when you're surprised by an enemy who has you outgunned you're first instinct is naturally going to be to try to run.
this can be a serious tactical mistake.
sometimes it's less important to get away immediately...
than it is to make sure your enemies can't follow.
ha! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you so much!
Oh, my god! That was amazing!
yelling time is over! Let's go!
that's it?
Yeah, it's a joint lab for the HSA, FBI, and D.E.A.
okay. Uh, these are the key cards for the front gate and that gets you past the guard in the front.
these access codes - that's for the lab and then the vault.
you'll stay in the car while I go in.
once I come out with the drive, we will head down to the docks, and we'll get you home.
wait! Wait.
let me ask you something.
why'd you come back for me, back at the storage place?
you had the codes. You could have just... Left me.
it would have been easier than that thing you did with the forklift.
I mean, seriously. What kind of thief are you?
I'm not a thief. At least not by choice.
so you're being forced to do this?
and I'm trying to do it with as little damage as possible.
okay, you can't go in there, man.
you can't use those key cards. - You just said they would work.
Yes, you can go in there, but you can't get away... Without getting caught.
have you ever heard of micro-rfid trackers?
special forces uses them to keep tabs on terrorists - About the size of a grain of rice.
well, no, they make them smaller now - Much smaller.
okay, you take one step in there - I get tagged?
Yeah. Okay, it's - It's a fail-safe.
I - it can't be hacked.
it gets in your clothes and your hair.
as soon as you step outside it transmits your location.
they'll have a satellite tracking your ass by the time you buckle up.
and your telling me this now?!
Hey, back when you were pointing guns at my face and kidnapping me,
I wanted you to get caught, okay?
I changed my mind!
so just tell whoever's behind this that it's a no-go.
you don't understand. I can't fail.
but if you step in there... You're tagged.
it's over.
it's not over.
if I can't go in there, i'll have to find someone who can go in for me.
Sam, Jesse. This is Oswald, creator of voidbot.
Hey. - hi.
do any of your friends ever smile? - yes.
so where do we stand?
well, unfortunately, anybody who takes anything out of the vault gets tagged, tracked by satellite, and pounced on by a fleet of fbi agents.
great. So what do we do, just draw straws?
no. We let Xavier go get it. - Wait a minute, what?
as in "coke dealer who wants you dead" xavier?
we know he wants it, and when the FBI grabs him, we solve the wanting-me-dead problem, too.
okay, but how do we get the software from him with the satellites watching?
we hit him someplace the satellites can't see, make ourselves a copy.
you're gonna call Xavier. You're gonna tell him you escaped from me.
you want to make a deal by offering up voidbot.
you ask for a couple hundred thousand dollars so he doesn't get suspicious.
that's crazy! I've dedicated my life to avoiding this man.
and if you do this, he'll be out of your life for good.
and sherry's, too.
fine, but this is a hell of a way of repaying me for getting you out of that lab.
hello. Uh... Hey, Xavier.
uh, can we make a deal?
Oz, stay cool. This whole thing is gonna be over in a few minutes.
okay, showtime.
okay, remind me again what's preventing Xavier from just killing me and taking the access codes?
don't panic. Jesse and I are here to protect you.
okay. A-and what if he kills you two?
Oh, well, if that happens, yeah, go ahead and panic. - What?
okay, that's good right there.
we're gonna do this deal at a nice, polite, respectful distance.
respectful? No.
this son of a bitch stole $5 million dollars from me - that's inaccurate. - Look at it this way.
a few years back, you were gonna pay $10 million for that virus.
instead, you're gonna pay what, $5 million and change?
man, that sounds like a bargain to me.
or, if you prefer, you can shoot ozzy, but that means we got to shoot back, and then a bunch of guys die, and you wasted all that cash for nothing.
so do we have a deal or not?
there we go. Yeah, come on. There we go.
give him the money.
Oz, come on.
okay, this is the card for the front gate.
this is the card for the guard and the restricted zone.
and this code will get you in the lab and the vault.
you think this is over?
I'm gonna find you and watch you die.
Hey, hey. Enough of that. We have a deal.
you want to whisper sweet nothings at Ozzy, that's gonna cost extra.
pleasure doing business with you son of a bitches, we'll see you later.
all right, stop right there.
no one leaves until I walk out of that place with the virus.
anything happens to me in there? Everyone dies.
active security systems are built to keep people out.
passive systems, on the other hand, don't prevent security breaches.
they help you catch the bad guy after he leaves.
they're often cheaper and more effective.
Plus, they let you know who your enemies are.
micro-rfid tags work like anti-theft tags in department stores, only they're a lot smaller and stick to clothes, shoes, and even hair.
once activated, they transmit a response to a coded signal.
from there, it's easy for a surveillance satellite to lock on and follow a high-value target.
we're good here. - Okay. It's been real.
and the best part is the target never even knew it happened.
Xavier's got his toy and is on the move. How you guys doing?
you ready to go? - Almost, sam. Where are they headed?
it's hard to tell, mikey. The S.U.V.'s are heading in two different directions.
probably trying to avoid a tail. - Stay on them, sam.
Xavier's driving north. - He's probably heading for his place in brickell.
all right, that means you can cut him off at 10th street, mike.
no, there's too much traffic there. 14th will give us more privacy.
well, I hope you're right, mikey, 'cause the eyes in the sky are gonna be watching by now.
Yeah. Sounds like the word's already out. The cops are scrambling.
they see you with xavier, they're gonna sweep you up, too.
the age of satellite surveillance has made some operations easier for spies and a lot harder for others.
if you need to secretly meet someone who's being tracked by a satellite, your options are pretty limited.
the only move is to make sure you're someplace the surveillance satellites can't see you.
that usually means a cave, a tunnel, or, in a pinch, a freeway overpass.
I think we have enough privacy under here.
see you soon.
okay, it's showtime we're set up just behind you about half a mile south of the bridge.
Xavier's headed our way. How's our emergency response?
we're cutting it close, mike.
you got two, maybe three minutes to copy that virus.
if it takes longer than that, we got bigger problems.
Hey, buddy! Get the hell out of our way!
I actually have a better idea.
I was hoping you could hand over the disk drive.
get back in the car, boys. All right, drop them.
it's cool, guys. I got this.
you son of a bitches are robbing me?
no need for name-calling. We're just making a copy of the disk.
don't think of it as robbery. Think of it as sharing at gunpoint.
come on. Hurry it up, mike. You're out of time.
air support's heading your way.
looks like the cops are headed this way, too.
now, that didn't hurt too bad, did it?
you think you can get away with this? - I think we just did.
now get the hell out of here.
get out of there, mike. You're out of time.
one of the nice things about sending a full-scale homeland security response after your enemies is the fact that you can get the resources of every branch of law enforcement, which means they generally catch whoever they're after.
and they don't listen to excuses.
come on, fellas. Look, you don't understand. I was set up.
get down! Hands on your head!
now that you don't need a fortress to stay hidden, are you gonna track down sherry?
well, if she's not too pissed.
well, I have a feeling she'll hear you out.
so this is your, um, uh, smuggler friend?
Yeah, he can get you back down to Puertorico in a few hours, but don't call him "smuggler.
can I just say one thing?
this virus is not a good thing.
and whoever you're getting it for is not a good person.
Yeah, I know. It's a little complicated.
I remember when I was making it, I thought I was this, like, badass outlaw or something.
and by the time I figured out I wasn't, it was too late.
so I don't know who michael's working for, but just tell him to be careful, 'cause some roads you go down, you can't get back from.
believe me, he knows.
we both do.
ma?
I want to thank you for helping with the police.
I talked to Sam.
you're really handing off a computer virus to this guy?
Anson has fi dead to rights. I don't have a choice.
I have to give him what he wants.
yeah? Then what?
then he disappears, and I try to move on.
I'll track him down one day.
what's the latest with the CIA?
I meet with pearce tomorrow.
I get the results back from my security review.
sounds like they're beginning to trust you.
just when they shouldn't.
you know, I don't like any of this, but for what it's worth, they should trust you...
now more than ever.
for a spy, loyalty is a strange thing.
your job is to deceive, to live among your enemies, to perform dark deeds for a noble purpose.
and it's that purpose that guides you through the darkness.
when you lose sight of that, the darkness is all there is.
you look like you could use a nap.
worried about the security review?
it crossed my mind.
any reason you should be worried?
you tell me.
you got your clearance. Congrats.
you're still off the books, but...
it's better than nothing.
I know we got off to a bumpy start, but I'm glad we can be honest with each other.
me too.
from now on, make sure the lies you tell are the ones we want you to tell.
anything for the agency.
good. They're cooking up some assignments in D.C.
we'll be in touch soon.
go.
celebrate.
you live in a beautiful place, Michael.
I prefer a climate without mosquitos.
you know what the secret of happiness is? Wanting what you have.
what I have is a flash drive.
what I want is everything you have on Fiona.
well, don't get ahead of yourself.
the virus does me no good in your hands. I need it in the CIA's computer system.
that shouldn't be too hard with your new security clearance.
you really expect me - Michael, listen to me.
I know you.
the martyr complex, the daddy issues, the problems with authority.
I know that every part of you...
is telling you to fight this.
but you've got to realize how smart I am, right?
so ask yourself, "why would I be willing to put myself in this position?
why am I so comfortable telling you that I own you?"
because it's true.
I just
when you're burned, you've got nothing
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way. You rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...Family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
for a spy, the first step after identifying your enemy and finding his base of operations is listening in on his communications.
this can be as simple as planting a bug in his phone or as complex as breaking into a military-grade encrypted radio.
higher security makes the job harder, but it comes with a silver lining
the tougher the security, the more valuable the information it's protecting.
if you can break in, you can be pretty sure it's going to be worth it.
Michael, I'm not sure we're gonna be able to pull this off.
anson's using a radio the NSA itself can't crack.
I don't want to just give up. - Well, I'm not giving up.
I'm just pointing out, there's no way that I can see to plant a listening device in his apartment or radio.
we'll have to use the building across the street -- the security firm.
he's piggybacking on their communications array. We get in there, get to the cell log on the server...
break into a defense contractor? - I didn't say it was gonna be easy.
you already destroyed CIA records. Just how far are you willing to go for this?
all the way.
in any secure facility, the biggest vulnerabilities tend to be at the lowest salary levels.
a company that will spend tens of thousands of dollars checking out senior staff will often hire janitors and window washers for 9 bucks an hour after a 20-minute interview.
getting hired is usually not too difficult, and it's even easier to pay someone a couple grand to hand over a uniform and leave town.
all right. This'll do.
the computer's connected to the server, and it looks like no one's in there.
stop fiddling. You look fine.
please. A burlap sack would be an improvement. You know, for $2, 000, I want a uniform that fits.
well, the next time I bribe the guys at, um, Rise & Shine Window Washers, I'll get an extra-extra-small.
Fi, this charge looks a little big. It's supposed to look like an accident.
all right. How about this? Dinner. You and me. Saturday night.
there you go. Except we're busy.
your mom called. She really wants another double date with Benny. I think they're getting serious.
do we really have to talk about that right now? - You can't avoid it forever.
I can try.
45 seconds. Go.
it's just a simple records search. 44 seconds is more than enough.
how about 10 seconds? - Almost done.
done.
put your hands up!
Oh, God! Oh, God! We almost died.
who are you two? - We work for... Rise & Shine Window Washers.
if we weren't clipped in to those harnesses, we'd be dead.
I can't believe we held on that long!
look, secure the area. I'm gonna take a statement from these two.
and again, please accept my apologies.
I'm just glad no one was killed.
does the company have your phone numbers?
I mean, it's such an odd incident. We may want to follow up, make sure everything's all right.
don't you think all the lawyers will do all the talking from now on?
lawyers? You're not, uh...you're not thinking of suing us?
well, I'm actually thinking about it, yeah. I mean
but security guards aren't normally named in lawsuits, are they? - I don't know.
well, you two can go. Get some rest. Feel better.
I am hungry. Lunch?
so, Anson was calling here? Well, that's odd.
Why? - Well, most calls around here are to, uh, invite widows to early-bird dinners.
this area's better known for retirees, not super-spies.
here we go. Someone's home.
Oh, my God.
wait a second. Is that... - Benny. As in, your mother's boyfriend, Benny.
I believe it is. That son of a bitch!
hold on, Fi. Hold on.
Benny could be working for Anson, but Anson could just as easily be spying on Benny.
either way, we have to tell Madeline. - No, not yet. Not until we know exactly what's going on here.
just... I have a meeting with Pearce. This is gonna take a while. I need to grab a cab.
let me guess. You want me to stay here, watch Benny, see what he's up to -- fine.
when the time comes, your mother's gonna hear about this from you.
well, look who's two minutes early.
I aim to please. You sounded tense on the phone.
we've got a job for you. We intercepted some calls placed by a weapons engineer, William Resnik.
he was ordering high-end guidance chips to be delivered to a Liberian chemical company upstate.
last I checked, the Liberians were too busy shooting each other to set up chemical companies.
last I checked, chemical companies don't need guidance chips.
this guy's been off the grid for a while, so there's more than a little concern he's gone rogue.
let me guess. You think the best option is sending in the burned spy.
actually, no. It's a Liberian company.
you spent a lot of time in that part of the world. There's too big of a risk that someone will know your face.
the Agency wants you to run the op with Sam and Jesse, send them into the chemical plant to figure out who Resnik's working for and what he's doing.
Sam has powerful detractors at the CIA. He could stand to mend some fences.
and it wouldn't hurt you to look like a team player, either.
you know me -- team player all the way.
so, Mike, that was one hell of a drive.
what are we looking at? - It's a chemical-research facility, closed two years ago.
half-dozen guys with A. K.s. Not something you expect to see out here.
it's a lot of activity for a closed shop.
lights came back on a month ago. Liberian company leased it.
trucks have been dropping off guidance equipment and long-range-missile components for the last few days.
according to who? Pearce?
the Agency thinks a weapons engineer, William Resnik, went rogue.
it certainly sounds like he's building a missile in there.
so what? Pearce wants you to go in and see what's up?
not me. You guys.
there's a good chance the target knows my face.
okay. You kind of buried the lead there, Mike.
you know, the last time I did a favor for the CIA, there were a few... Hiccups.
I know, Sam, but we're all on the same team this time.
Resnik made a purchase from a black-market chip manufacturer. The CIA squeezed them.
you guys are gonna get swapped in as the tech guys.
Pearce put together our cover before she asked if we would do it?
she was counting on you guys saying yes.
not loving how this went down, Mike, but I'm not gonna pass up a chance to bag a traitor.
Yeah, someone's got to babysit Sam. I'm in.
Thanks.
one of the few businesses that still make house calls is black-market technology vendors.
get out of the car now.
when someone's paying a lot of cash for illegal weapons-systems components, they expect full service.
and when your customer will settle any issues with a bullet to the head, it's a good idea to show up in person.
brought the materials you ordered. - You can go.
the balance will be wired into your account.
don't -- sir. Please. This is delicate high-end product.
now, I can't guarantee performance unless my tech and I oversee the install.
don't worry. We got an expert inside.
question -- what sort of seating is your expert using?
seating. As in, what the chip sits in. I got the 48-hexa-bit X-95s.
if he's expecting the 128s, he may as well toss the chip, jam in a piece of salami, and hope for the best.
okay. - Seriously.
hands up.
hands what? - Hands up!
nothing there.
follow me.
go on inside. Lab's in there.
uh, you see how those guards are keeping an eye on that guy?
Jesse, I don't think we're dealing with a rogue scientist. I think we're dealing with a hostage.
okay.
I guess extraction's out of the question. We're just a tad bit out-muscled.
Yeah, but we can't just drop these chips off and leave the poor bastard.
we got to get ourselves invited back in.
how the hell do we do that? - I got an idea.
Hey. I got your guidance chips.
what happened to Arnie? - Arnie's working a job up in Boca. We're your guys.
okay. Let's see what we got going here.
put that down! Don't touch that!
knuckleheads. We know you're building a missile, okay?
I didn't bring guidance chips for a Cuisinart. It's like I told your buddy outside
I got to check the seating here, but I can't do it through a tarp.
easy.
Hey, buddy, pal, I need to see the, uh, power supply you're working with.
Oh, yeah. It's just in the back, over here.
we're with the CIA. We're here to help. We don't have a lot of time. Tell me what's going on.
no, no. You have to leave.
Hey, listen to me. You want to survive, you will talk. You're not gonna get another chance.
don't worry about the guards. They're busy watching my friend over there.
his name is Joseph Kamba. He's a lunatic. He's, like, some sort of warlord.
he's having me build a missile. It's a nasty one.
listen -- I can't escape.
he has my daughter, and I don't know where she is.
your daughter? - Yeah.
Oh, Jesus. All right, we'll deal with that. We'll deal with that.
first we got to convince these guys to let us back in here after we leave, and we cannot do that alone.
you need to play along, okay? Can you do that?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
damn it. I knew it. I knew it. We don't have the right specs.
is there a problem? Perhaps I can be of assistance.
Yes, sir. There is a problem.
the housings in your missile don't fit the chips that we brought.
well... That is unfortunate. Care to offer an explanation?
well, it's not like, uh... All this stuff comes from -- from Radio Shack, you know.
t-the suppliers we're using, t-they change the housings and components all the time.
I never know when it's gonna happen. Nobody -- Nobody knows.
I thought I made it clear there were to be no mistakes, Mr. Resnik.
perhaps a reminder is in order.
it's an easy fix. We can get you the right chips tomorrow.
we've got a batch of L-21s coming in. One quick mod, it'll fit your platform. This is -- this is no one's fault.
okay? You didn't need to do that.
I'll tell you what I need.
I need the guidance chips I paid for, and I need them now.
look, no one's telling you not to be upset. You should be upset.
but the thing is, look, if we don't get this right, you might as well throw the missile, 'cause it's gonna be a lot more accurate.
very well. We will make a new arrangement. You bring my chips here tomorrow, and we trade.
my chips... for your friend.
what? No. No way. That's not how I do business.
it is exactly how I do business.
having Jesse in there is bad. Very bad.
this Kamba guy's a first-class monster, even by sub-Saharan African standards.
Yeah, I know. I read the file. That's why I've got to get back in there right now.
Sam, slow down. If we try to break Jesse out before we get Resnik's girl, she's dead.
I don't disagree. But we can't leave Jesse in there forever while we're hunting this Resnik girl down.
she could be anywhere.
and one other thing -- the CIA wants the specs for Resnik's missile.
is that a joke?
this is a new missile design. Those specs are considered
don't you dare say "mission critical," lady.
Jesse and Resnik are top priority.
I want him out of there, too.
look, Mike, getting him out of there is gonna be easier said than done.
that psycho's got about a dozen guys strolling around with AK-47s.
then we need to figure out a way to get our guns past the guards.
spies are surprisingly good recyclers.
the ability to repurpose items in the field can often mean the difference between life and death.
a broken eyepiece from a microscope can make the perfect disguise for a rifle sight.
and a computer with a fried motherboard can house the magazine of an M-4 rifle.
it's not exactly separating your bottles and cans, but it'll keep trash out of the landfill and possibly keep you out of the morgue.
what's up, Fi? - It's Benny. And it's not good.
I've tailed him for a couple of hours, and he's definitely acting suspicious, showing signs that he's been trained.
and I've got the pictures to prove it.
okay. I'll go talk to my mom.
but Fi -- let me guess. Another favor.
not for me. For the CIA. A girl's been kidnapped.
Pearce thinks they tracked her down. I'm gonna text you the address. See if she's in there.
so I'm just watching, not kicking down any doors?
no door-kicking. - Fine.
but, Michael, go talk to your mom. Right now.
whatever you're here for, Michael, it can wait.
Benny's on his way over. He's gonna take me to the movies.
actually, mom... It's about Benny.
about Benny? What's wrong?
the man who's blackmailing me, Anson...
he's using Benny to spy on you... and us.
What?! Michael, don't be ridiculous.
I'm not being ridiculous. It's true, mother.
we traced a phone call.
you're serious.
no way. Benny isn't like that.
he's not a spy.
you're right, mom. He's not. He's not a trained operative.
but Anson is teaching him some tricks
how to spot a tail, not parking in the same space twice...
no. See, I,uh... I told Benny a lot of those crazy things that you had me do.
that's probably why he's acting like this.
mom, he's acting like an asset who's being run by a spy.
I have to bug his place this afternoon, so keep him at the movies.
just act normal.
you make it sound so easy. - It is, Ma.
it's easy for you.
ever occur to you maybe you're wrong? - I'm not wrong.
I know this hurts you, but you have to trust me on this.
no. Not on this one.
I'll find out the truth my own way.
and if you're right... I'll plant the bug myself.
but if you're wrong... 256 00: 17: 42, 360 -- > 00: 17: 45, 580 Benny, hi! Oh, they're beautiful.
for a beautiful woman. - Thank you.
Hello, Michael. - Good to see you, Benny.
how you doing? Hey, listen. You want to join us?
I'm not normally a fan of romantic movies, but I promised your mom that I would take her.
thanks for the invite, but I have to go... Do something.
that sounds mysterious. What is it?
it's me, always working. - Okay.
have fun, you two.
you about ready? - Yeah, I just have to put these in water.
okay. a thermal imaging camera. Very nice.
Michael, it's not my birthday for months.
cute. Pearce hooked us up with them. I have to give them back.
any sign of Resnik's daughter? - No. I've been here for hours. Nobody's come in or out.
the far-right window is covered, though. I'm guessing that's where they're keeping her.
one way to find out for sure.
it's a little hard to tell, but I'd say we're looking at... Five heat signatures inside, all static.
one seated in the far-right room on the second floor.
well, I'll go kick the hornets' nest.
hello. I'm Joyce, your new neighbor.
I baked you some brownies. There you go.
either those boys are having a linebacker slumber party or they're guarding someone.
four moved the moment you rang the bell.
one stayed still, tucked in the upstairs room, away from the window.
my guess, that's Sophie.
you sure we just can't go in there and grab her?
Fi, they got Jesse.
we pull her out now, they'll know something's wrong.
Jesse could get killed.
I'm gonna let Sam know it's time to get back into the shark tank.
whether you're smuggling drugs to sell or weapons to save a friend, you can't just hide contraband and pray.
you have to be able to talk your way through an inspection.
okay, just like I promised. Fresh batch of L-21s with adapters.
all set to go.
the key is to keep cool and keep talking.
the more they're listening to you, the less they're looking at whatever it is you're carrying.
uh, with all due respect, sir, we got a missile to build and, you know, testing these chips is gonna take a while, so if you could just open the gate, I can drive up and unload everything.
I have a rule. No one drives in.
no vehicles on the property.
Hey, you know. I'm all for reducing carbon emissions, but you got to see what I got back here.
I mean, that is a lot of equipment to lug around, so if we can just, uh...
I'm afraid not.
it may seem strange to you, but in my country, a truck is just a weapon on wheels.
you want something, you carry it in.
sir, let's be reasonable here.
reasonable. Another thing about my country.
reasonable men die.
the ones who survive are cautious men... Like me.
what is all this? - Oh, microscopes, lenses, processors.
you know, I mean, what am I gonna do -- kill you with a microscope?
bring some men to carry the equipment.
Yeah, boss.
Yeah, listen -- I hate to be a broken record, but are you sure about this no-car policy?
I mean, we're just gonna have to haul all this stuff back out when we're done.
he said no. - Okay, fine. Whatever.
can you give us a minute? We got work to do.
how you guys doing?
Oh, it's not the nicest place I've ever stayed, but we're fine.
just please, please tell me you got some big-ass, bad-ass guns in those cases.
at most, I got half an M-4. The rest is in the truck outside the gate.
this is a disaster. You said you were gonna help.
I can't delay the missile anymore. You know, he's getting impatient.
I understand that, but right now the focus is getting you out of here.
yeah? How? With what? You don't have any guns. You think Joseph's gonna let you back in here a third time?
that's why you need to give him a reason to let us stay here.
why in the world would he do that? - If you were injured, we'd have to.
I'm sorry. What?
what he's saying is, if you couldn't do the work yourself, you would need us to stay.
therefore, he would need us to stay, if he wants the job finished.
if you just burn your hand or something, you know? Just bad enough to sideline you.
if we get pushed out those doors, you are on your own.
you really want to bet your daughter's life on Joseph just letting you go after you hand him the missile?
you can do this.
what do you mean the burner malfunctioned?!
is this some kind of game you're playing at? Is that what this is?
a game? Look at his hand. It was an accident.
just calm down.
do not tell me to calm down!
I'm just saying there's a solution.
I'm thinking the solution here is three graves.
wait. Just listen, okay?
listen. You want your missile. You want your missile, right?
we know the equipment in that lab. He doesn't need his hands. We'll be his hands.
you're looking at the best chip guy in the business. And I know a thing or two about missile assembly.
please.
please. We can do this.
all right, then.
I let them be your hands. And you guarantee no more delays. We have a deal?
Absolutely. We have a deal.
fine. We shake on it.
I suggest you get to work.
okay, Mike. Here's the deal.
we couldn't get the guns in.
and without the guns, we can't make a move, so we're in a tight spot here, no joke.
there might be another way, but it's gonna take some doing on your part.
I'm all ears, brother.
the north side of the plant, near the tanker -- I'm gonna bury two M-4s 20 feet from the fence.
you just figure a way to get there.
I'm on it. Thanks, Mike.
okay. We're all set here. Co2 levels have been adjusted.
looks like we're gonna get the guns after all.
but we're gonna have to convince Joseph to move the fence first.
what? Why?
because that's where the guns are gonna be.
okay, that's crazy.
no, no, no. That can work.
that can work. We tweak the electronics on the missile, blame it on the electric fence.
okay. All right. Let's do it. Let's do it.
it should be me in there, fi.
Yeah, well, it isn't. You're doing everything you can.
the rest, I'm afraid, is on them.
nice.
you could walk right over these and not even know they're there.
there is a fine art to making an electrical malfunction look spectacular and yet not do any real damage, especially when you're dealing with a deadly missile.
just up to the I-O bridge, right? - I got it. Yeah.
okay, now. Be careful.
I'm just saying -- you're touching the warhead to the guidance chips now.
so, one mistake and it's lights-out.
you know, I'm actually already on top of that.
okay.
the trick is to overload a non-explosive component, like the motherboard.
replacing resistors with plain copper wire will amplify the current, overload the circuit, and result in some impressive but relatively harmless fireworks.
okay, are we ready? - We'll know for sure in a minute.
all right. Tell your boss it's testing time.
they're ready.
okay. Here we go.
okay. Show me progress.
well, the guidance chips are state-of-the-art, with special environmental modification software to make sure
all I care about is whether or not I have a working missile that will reach Monrovia from the Sierra Leone border.
I'll let the target worry about how it works.
all right. Guys, turn on the guidance system.
what is happening?! What is this?!
must be an electrical problem.
the circuits are fried. We're getting some sort of interference. I don't know.
I said no more delays!
Yeah, we heard you! We heard you. What? You think we're crazy?! You think we want to get shot?!
come on! Please.
just, we'll go outside, we'll run some tests, we'll figure out what's going on.
all right. You... And you. Let's go.
Yeah. No, it's definitely the electrified fence.
is it? How convenient.
what? - Yeah, the -- the fence is too close to the building, so it's, um
it's causing a power surge. It fried a capacitor already. It'll do it again.
you want your missile? You're gonna have to take down the fence.
you think I am a child? Do you think I will tear down this fence because of your lies?!
okay. Listen. Listen. Okay. How about this? How about this?
just move the fence. Just move it back past the tree line.
that'll solve the problem. You keep your fence, you get your missile, we go home, everybody wins.
fine. We'll move it.
there's nothing quite like searching the home of someone you care about for evidence they've betrayed you.
it's something spies have to do regularly, even with the people they love the most.
it's never easy searching for something as hard as you can and praying you find nothing at all.
Maddy. - Hey.
what are you doing here? - What do you think I'm doing here? Surprising you.
how'd you get in?
Benny... I mean, come on. I've stayed over a few times. That fake rock of yours doesn't fool anybody.
well, why wouldn't you just -- - Why wouldn't I just make dinner for my boyfriend?
salmon. Your favorite.
and for dessert, pecan pie.
pecan pie?
you know me too well, Mad.
better every day, Benny.
I left wine in the car.
and, uh -- would you get it? And I'll set the table.
okay. You're gonna have to remind me to leave the house more often.
that back door is all glass.
if you punch in hard, you should be able to get the attention of all the guards on the first floor.
I'll be fine, Michael. Just get up the stairs fast.
get Sophie out of there.
let me check their position. We'll move as soon as we hear from Sam.
Fi, we got a problem.
they're not in there.
so, they moved the fence. Now what?
I'm gonna run the gauge along it, and when I get to the guns, I'm gonna need a distraction.
well, these guys seem pretty tense. Shouldn't be too hard to get their attention.
I'm gonna take out the guys near me, and I'll get the guns before they know what's happening.
Oh, wait. Check it out.
I thought Joseph wasn't letting any vehicles in.
he wasn't. Something's up.
sir, we need to check the fence.
that can wait. I want to show you something.
Sophie. Sophie! Did they hurt you?
no. Daddy, I just want to go home.
what the hell is she doing here?
well, in my experience, a father always works harder when he knows he's working for his family.
tell me something. Do you love your daughter? Do you want to keep her safe?
please. She's just a child, okay? Please.
do your job. No more delays and excuses.
show me... ...What a father will do to keep his daughter safe.
you have two hours.
get them inside.
there's nothing else I can do. I don't have a choice, okay. I need to just finish it for him.
look, I can't presume to know what you're going through as a father, but handing a completed missile over to Joseph is a bad idea.
I'm done listening to you. He has my daughter. I have to finish.
okay. What's gonna happen then, huh? Think about it.
seriously, man, he's not gonna spring you just so you can go tell the world what he did.
best case, we all get to go to Liberia and make more missiles for him.
what's the worst case? - He decides he only needs one missile, and he kills us.
okay. What the hell do you propose?
I'm working on it. Keep busy and stay cool.
all right. Who cut this tail fin?!
it's 3/8 of an inch too wide! Come on, guys!
Sam, listen. We don't have much time. They moved Sophie.
chances are, they brought her to the plant.
fi and Pearce are scouting the perimeter now.
well, they can stop looking, 'cause Kamba's got her.
so she's still alive? - Yeah, for now.
but Mike, look. Joseph's in a killing mood. He's paranoid about the delays, and he brought the girl in to motivate Resnik.
Sam, listen. There might be a way out.
do you think you can convince him the delays aren't an accident that one of his own men has betrayed him?
like a sabotage play?
kind of a divide-and-conquer type thing?
I can tell the story, Mike, but I don't think I can back it up from here.
remember Ukraine,'97.
you think that could work here?
Yeah. Is 10 minutes enough time?
I guess it'll have to be.
okay. Thanks, brother.
what's going on? We got a plan?
Yeah. 10 minutes from now, don't be near any gas pipes.
Mike's gonna put on a little show for our friend Kamba. I'm gonna go meet with him now.
okay. What can we do? - Is this thing about ready?
well, we have to solder a few more leads.
good. Arm it. Make sure it's ready to blow.
you -- guard guy. I got to talk to your boss now.
an electrified fence can't protect against someone who has no need to breach it.
when you have a network of gas pipes that run across property lines, a well-placed block of C-4 on a gas main outside the fence can cause an explosive chain reaction inside whatever compound that fence is protecting.
was I unclear in my instructions? - No, sir. You were perfectly clear.
we, um... We need to talk alone.
Oh, do we?
sir, I know that I'm risking my life coming here, but I have no reason to lie.
I just need a moment of your time.
out. Everybody, now.
sir, we got to talk about these delays.
now, I know it's something that you might not want to hear, but somebody is working against us, someone on the inside.
from the inside? You mean one of my men?
Yes, sir. I don't know who or why, but it's the only explanation, 'cause your men are the only ones with access.
tell me something.
why would one of my men board a boat in Liberia, cross an ocean, help me build this place, and then betray me?
I don't know, sir. I'm just saying, things are going wrong, and I don't think it's all accidents.
one of your men is
you worry about the missile. I'll worry about my men.
there is no sabotage here, just incompetence!
sir, what's going on?! - The gas lines! Somebody blew the gas lines!
sir, you've got to believe me. Whoever's behind this is making their move right now.
how do I know it wasn't you?
me?! How the hell could it be me? I'm stuck in the lab.
so it's just coincidence that all this happened when you and your friend arrived here?
my friend and I are here to do a job for money.
it doesn't get done, we don't get paid, 'cause we don't work for free.
so maybe... It's Resnik.
sir, please, the last thing you want to do right now is kill the only reason why that guy is still building a missile for you.
so please, sir, let's just try and salvage this situation.
but we need to go now, before the cops get here.
fine. We'll take her.
why are you still standing there? Go put out that fire now.
but you said -- - and now I am saying go. Now, go!
so, do you have a plan to get the missile out?
sir, the missile weighs 900 pounds. There's no way we're getting it out of here.
what? - You don't need this missile. You got us. We'll build you a new one.
it's true. I can get you a lab, anything you want.
don't hurt Sophie, and I'll do whatever you want me to do.
so what happens to that?
that's the beautiful part.
we arm the warhead to blow and leave it behind for whatever son of a bitch was behind this whole fiasco.
that way you'll kill the rat and you get rid of the evidence all in one move.
fine. Do it!
now, sir, when this is done, we're gonna have to stay away from your guards, 'cause at this point, we don't know who's with you and who's against you.
we can shut the power down and sneak through the section of the fence you just moved, but we got to do it now.
okay. We got two minutes, and this thing's gonna blow.
if any of you try to escape, I shoot you all.
now, go!
what's happening? What are you doing?
never mind. Go back to the lab. To the missile.
go! All of you!
now move faster! Or I shoot her in the leg!
all right. All right.
he's watching us too closely to get the guns.
I thought you said that thing was gonna blow in two minutes, man.
I set it for two minutes. I don't know what's happening. There must be something wrong.
I don't know what it is.
now you see how I deal with my enemies.
Oh, yeah? Drop it.
that's how we deal with our enemies.
well, I just got off a very unpleasant phone call with my superiors.
they wanted those weapon specs.
come on, Pearce. That was a pretty nasty missile. I think it's best for everybody that it's gone.
Yeah, about that.
they have a hard time believing that Joseph Kamba blew up his own missile.
well, that's the thing about crazy warlords.
never know what kind of crazy idea's just gonna ...pop into their pop into their crazy, little warlord head.
the job got done, but neither of you made a lot of friends with this one.
giving the CIA half of what they wanted is the Sam Axe specialty.
what's gonna happen to Resnik now that Kamba's been taken down?
I convinced the brass to unofficially help get him and his daughter out of the country.
I'll say this much for you, Westen. You know how to run an op.
what op? We were never here.
it's always difficult eavesdropping on someone you know well or, worse, someone you care about.
the closer you are to them, the worse it feels to listen in on their private moments.
harder still is spying on someone you love who's blatantly betraying you.
ma, you don't have to do this. I'm fine sitting here by myself.
okay. I don't care how long it takes.
I planted that bug. I want to hear what he has to say.
I want to know if it was all a lie.
it's never all a lie.
it's always more complicated than that.
I thought he had feelings for me.
honestly, he probably did.
hello. - You haven't returned my calls.
that must be Anson on the other end.
I've done everything you've asked of me. When will it be enough?
when I say it is. You did take my money, after all.
Yes. I took your money. And I feel terrible.
I'd give it all back if I could. I hurt this woman.
and I think she's starting to suspect something.
now is not the time to panic. Do you understand? - I understand.
did you get the package I sent you? - Yeah, i got the package.
package?
I don't see why I need another wireless mike. The one I have works just fine.
M-Michael! What's happening?!
Yes. I'm opening it.
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way. You rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...Family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
for a spy, the first step after identifying your enemy and finding his base of operations is listening in on his communications.
this can be as simple as planting a bug in his phone or as complex as breaking into a military-grade encrypted radio.
higher security makes the job harder, but it comes with a silver lining
the tougher the security, the more valuable the information it's protecting.
if you can break in, you can be pretty sure it's going to be worth it.
Michael, I'm not sure we're gonna be able to pull this off.
anson's using a radio the NSA itself can't crack.
I don't want to just give up. - Well, I'm not giving up.
I'm just pointing out, there's no way that I can see to plant a listening device in his apartment or radio.
we'll have to use the building across the street -- the security firm.
he's piggybacking on their communications array. We get in there, get to the cell log on the server...
break into a defense contractor? - I didn't say it was gonna be easy.
you already destroyed CIA records. Just how far are you willing to go for this?
all the way.
in any secure facility, the biggest vulnerabilities tend to be at the lowest salary levels.
a company that will spend tens of thousands of dollars checking out senior staff will often hire janitors and window washers for 9 bucks an hour after a 20-minute interview.
getting hired is usually not too difficult, and it's even easier to pay someone a couple grand to hand over a uniform and leave town.
all right. This'll do.
the computer's connected to the server, and it looks like no one's in there.
stop fiddling. You look fine.
please. A burlap sack would be an improvement. You know, for $2, 000, I want a uniform that fits.
well, the next time I bribe the guys at, um, Rise & Shine Window Washers, I'll get an extra-extra-small.
Fi, this charge looks a little big. It's supposed to look like an accident.
all right. How about this? Dinner. You and me. Saturday night.
there you go. Except we're busy.
your mom called. She really wants another double date with Benny. I think they're getting serious.
do we really have to talk about that right now? - You can't avoid it forever.
I can try.
45 seconds. Go.
it's just a simple records search. 44 seconds is more than enough.
how about 10 seconds? - Almost done.
done.
put your hands up!
Oh, God! Oh, God! We almost died.
who are you two? - We work for... Rise & Shine Window Washers.
if we weren't clipped in to those harnesses, we'd be dead.
I can't believe we held on that long!
look, secure the area. I'm gonna take a statement from these two.
and again, please accept my apologies.
I'm just glad no one was killed.
does the company have your phone numbers?
I mean, it's such an odd incident. We may want to follow up, make sure everything's all right.
don't you think all the lawyers will do all the talking from now on?
lawyers? You're not, uh...you're not thinking of suing us?
well, I'm actually thinking about it, yeah. I mean
but security guards aren't normally named in lawsuits, are they? - I don't know.
well, you two can go. Get some rest. Feel better.
I am hungry. Lunch?
so, Anson was calling here? Well, that's odd.
Why? - Well, most calls around here are to, uh, invite widows to early-bird dinners.
this area's better known for retirees, not super-spies.
here we go. Someone's home.
Oh, my God.
wait a second. Is that... - Benny. As in, your mother's boyfriend, Benny.
I believe it is. That son of a bitch!
hold on, Fi. Hold on.
Benny could be working for Anson, but Anson could just as easily be spying on Benny.
either way, we have to tell Madeline. - No, not yet. Not until we know exactly what's going on here.
just... I have a meeting with Pearce. This is gonna take a while. I need to grab a cab.
let me guess. You want me to stay here, watch Benny, see what he's up to -- fine.
when the time comes, your mother's gonna hear about this from you.
well, look who's two minutes early.
I aim to please. You sounded tense on the phone.
we've got a job for you. We intercepted some calls placed by a weapons engineer, William Resnik.
he was ordering high-end guidance chips to be delivered to a Liberian chemical company upstate.
last I checked, the Liberians were too busy shooting each other to set up chemical companies.
last I checked, chemical companies don't need guidance chips.
this guy's been off the grid for a while, so there's more than a little concern he's gone rogue.
let me guess. You think the best option is sending in the burned spy.
actually, no. It's a Liberian company.
you spent a lot of time in that part of the world. There's too big of a risk that someone will know your face.
the Agency wants you to run the op with Sam and Jesse, send them into the chemical plant to figure out who Resnik's working for and what he's doing.
Sam has powerful detractors at the CIA. He could stand to mend some fences.
and it wouldn't hurt you to look like a team player, either.
you know me -- team player all the way.
so, Mike, that was one hell of a drive.
what are we looking at? - It's a chemical-research facility, closed two years ago.
half-dozen guys with A. K.s. Not something you expect to see out here.
it's a lot of activity for a closed shop.
lights came back on a month ago. Liberian company leased it.
trucks have been dropping off guidance equipment and long-range-missile components for the last few days.
according to who? Pearce?
the Agency thinks a weapons engineer, William Resnik, went rogue.
it certainly sounds like he's building a missile in there.
so what? Pearce wants you to go in and see what's up?
not me. You guys.
there's a good chance the target knows my face.
okay. You kind of buried the lead there, Mike.
you know, the last time I did a favor for the CIA, there were a few... Hiccups.
I know, Sam, but we're all on the same team this time.
Resnik made a purchase from a black-market chip manufacturer. The CIA squeezed them.
you guys are gonna get swapped in as the tech guys.
Pearce put together our cover before she asked if we would do it?
she was counting on you guys saying yes.
not loving how this went down, Mike, but I'm not gonna pass up a chance to bag a traitor.
Yeah, someone's got to babysit Sam. I'm in.
Thanks.
one of the few businesses that still make house calls is black-market technology vendors.
get out of the car now.
when someone's paying a lot of cash for illegal weapons-systems components, they expect full service.
and when your customer will settle any issues with a bullet to the head, it's a good idea to show up in person.
brought the materials you ordered. - You can go.
the balance will be wired into your account.
don't -- sir. Please. This is delicate high-end product.
now, I can't guarantee performance unless my tech and I oversee the install.
don't worry. We got an expert inside.
question -- what sort of seating is your expert using?
seating. As in, what the chip sits in. I got the 48-hexa-bit X-95s.
if he's expecting the 128s, he may as well toss the chip, jam in a piece of salami, and hope for the best.
okay. - Seriously.
hands up.
hands what? - Hands up!
nothing there.
follow me.
go on inside. Lab's in there.
uh, you see how those guards are keeping an eye on that guy?
Jesse, I don't think we're dealing with a rogue scientist. I think we're dealing with a hostage.
okay.
I guess extraction's out of the question. We're just a tad bit out-muscled.
Yeah, but we can't just drop these chips off and leave the poor bastard.
we got to get ourselves invited back in.
how the hell do we do that? - I got an idea.
Hey. I got your guidance chips.
what happened to Arnie? - Arnie's working a job up in Boca. We're your guys.
okay. Let's see what we got going here.
put that down! Don't touch that!
knuckleheads. We know you're building a missile, okay?
I didn't bring guidance chips for a Cuisinart. It's like I told your buddy outside
I got to check the seating here, but I can't do it through a tarp.
easy.
Hey, buddy, pal, I need to see the, uh, power supply you're working with.
Oh, yeah. It's just in the back, over here.
we're with the CIA. We're here to help. We don't have a lot of time. Tell me what's going on.
no, no. You have to leave.
Hey, listen to me. You want to survive, you will talk. You're not gonna get another chance.
don't worry about the guards. They're busy watching my friend over there.
his name is Joseph Kamba. He's a lunatic. He's, like, some sort of warlord.
he's having me build a missile. It's a nasty one.
listen -- I can't escape.
he has my daughter, and I don't know where she is.
your daughter? - Yeah.
Oh, Jesus. All right, we'll deal with that. We'll deal with that.
first we got to convince these guys to let us back in here after we leave, and we cannot do that alone.
you need to play along, okay? Can you do that?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
damn it. I knew it. I knew it. We don't have the right specs.
is there a problem? Perhaps I can be of assistance.
Yes, sir. There is a problem.
the housings in your missile don't fit the chips that we brought.
well... That is unfortunate. Care to offer an explanation?
well, it's not like, uh... All this stuff comes from -- from Radio Shack, you know.
t-the suppliers we're using, t-they change the housings and components all the time.
I never know when it's gonna happen. Nobody -- Nobody knows.
I thought I made it clear there were to be no mistakes, Mr. Resnik.
perhaps a reminder is in order.
it's an easy fix. We can get you the right chips tomorrow.
we've got a batch of L-21s coming in. One quick mod, it'll fit your platform. This is -- this is no one's fault.
okay? You didn't need to do that.
I'll tell you what I need.
I need the guidance chips I paid for, and I need them now.
look, no one's telling you not to be upset. You should be upset.
but the thing is, look, if we don't get this right, you might as well throw the missile, 'cause it's gonna be a lot more accurate.
very well. We will make a new arrangement. You bring my chips here tomorrow, and we trade.
my chips... for your friend.
what? No. No way. That's not how I do business.
it is exactly how I do business.
having Jesse in there is bad. Very bad.
this Kamba guy's a first-class monster, even by sub-Saharan African standards.
Yeah, I know. I read the file. That's why I've got to get back in there right now.
Sam, slow down. If we try to break Jesse out before we get Resnik's girl, she's dead.
I don't disagree. But we can't leave Jesse in there forever while we're hunting this Resnik girl down.
she could be anywhere.
and one other thing -- the CIA wants the specs for Resnik's missile.
is that a joke?
this is a new missile design. Those specs are considered
don't you dare say "mission critical," lady.
Jesse and Resnik are top priority.
I want him out of there, too.
look, Mike, getting him out of there is gonna be easier said than done.
that psycho's got about a dozen guys strolling around with AK-47s.
then we need to figure out a way to get our guns past the guards.
spies are surprisingly good recyclers.
the ability to repurpose items in the field can often mean the difference between life and death.
a broken eyepiece from a microscope can make the perfect disguise for a rifle sight.
and a computer with a fried motherboard can house the magazine of an M-4 rifle.
it's not exactly separating your bottles and cans, but it'll keep trash out of the landfill and possibly keep you out of the morgue.
what's up, Fi? - It's Benny. And it's not good.
I've tailed him for a couple of hours, and he's definitely acting suspicious, showing signs that he's been trained.
and I've got the pictures to prove it.
okay. I'll go talk to my mom.
but Fi -- let me guess. Another favor.
not for me. For the CIA. A girl's been kidnapped.
Pearce thinks they tracked her down. I'm gonna text you the address. See if she's in there.
so I'm just watching, not kicking down any doors?
no door-kicking. - Fine.
but, Michael, go talk to your mom. Right now.
whatever you're here for, Michael, it can wait.
Benny's on his way over. He's gonna take me to the movies.
actually, mom... It's about Benny.
about Benny? What's wrong?
the man who's blackmailing me, Anson...
he's using Benny to spy on you... and us.
What?! Michael, don't be ridiculous.
I'm not being ridiculous. It's true, mother.
we traced a phone call.
you're serious.
no way. Benny isn't like that.
he's not a spy.
you're right, mom. He's not. He's not a trained operative.
but Anson is teaching him some tricks
how to spot a tail, not parking in the same space twice...
no. See, I,uh... I told Benny a lot of those crazy things that you had me do.
that's probably why he's acting like this.
mom, he's acting like an asset who's being run by a spy.
I have to bug his place this afternoon, so keep him at the movies.
just act normal.
you make it sound so easy. - It is, Ma.
it's easy for you.
ever occur to you maybe you're wrong? - I'm not wrong.
I know this hurts you, but you have to trust me on this.
no. Not on this one.
I'll find out the truth my own way.
and if you're right... I'll plant the bug myself.
but if you're wrong... 256 00: 17: 42, 360 -- > 00: 17: 45, 580 Benny, hi! Oh, they're beautiful.
for a beautiful woman. - Thank you.
Hello, Michael. - Good to see you, Benny.
how you doing? Hey, listen. You want to join us?
I'm not normally a fan of romantic movies, but I promised your mom that I would take her.
thanks for the invite, but I have to go... Do something.
that sounds mysterious. What is it?
it's me, always working. - Okay.
have fun, you two.
you about ready? - Yeah, I just have to put these in water.
okay. a thermal imaging camera. Very nice.
Michael, it's not my birthday for months.
cute. Pearce hooked us up with them. I have to give them back.
any sign of Resnik's daughter? - No. I've been here for hours. Nobody's come in or out.
the far-right window is covered, though. I'm guessing that's where they're keeping her.
one way to find out for sure.
it's a little hard to tell, but I'd say we're looking at... Five heat signatures inside, all static.
one seated in the far-right room on the second floor.
well, I'll go kick the hornets' nest.
hello. I'm Joyce, your new neighbor.
I baked you some brownies. There you go.
either those boys are having a linebacker slumber party or they're guarding someone.
four moved the moment you rang the bell.
one stayed still, tucked in the upstairs room, away from the window.
my guess, that's Sophie.
you sure we just can't go in there and grab her?
Fi, they got Jesse.
we pull her out now, they'll know something's wrong.
Jesse could get killed.
I'm gonna let Sam know it's time to get back into the shark tank.
whether you're smuggling drugs to sell or weapons to save a friend, you can't just hide contraband and pray.
you have to be able to talk your way through an inspection.
okay, just like I promised. Fresh batch of L-21s with adapters.
all set to go.
the key is to keep cool and keep talking.
the more they're listening to you, the less they're looking at whatever it is you're carrying.
uh, with all due respect, sir, we got a missile to build and, you know, testing these chips is gonna take a while, so if you could just open the gate, I can drive up and unload everything.
I have a rule. No one drives in.
no vehicles on the property.
Hey, you know. I'm all for reducing carbon emissions, but you got to see what I got back here.
I mean, that is a lot of equipment to lug around, so if we can just, uh...
I'm afraid not.
it may seem strange to you, but in my country, a truck is just a weapon on wheels.
you want something, you carry it in.
sir, let's be reasonable here.
reasonable. Another thing about my country.
reasonable men die.
the ones who survive are cautious men... Like me.
what is all this? - Oh, microscopes, lenses, processors.
you know, I mean, what am I gonna do -- kill you with a microscope?
bring some men to carry the equipment.
Yeah, boss.
Yeah, listen -- I hate to be a broken record, but are you sure about this no-car policy?
I mean, we're just gonna have to haul all this stuff back out when we're done.
he said no. - Okay, fine. Whatever.
can you give us a minute? We got work to do.
how you guys doing?
Oh, it's not the nicest place I've ever stayed, but we're fine.
just please, please tell me you got some big-ass, bad-ass guns in those cases.
at most, I got half an M-4. The rest is in the truck outside the gate.
this is a disaster. You said you were gonna help.
I can't delay the missile anymore. You know, he's getting impatient.
I understand that, but right now the focus is getting you out of here.
yeah? How? With what? You don't have any guns. You think Joseph's gonna let you back in here a third time?
that's why you need to give him a reason to let us stay here.
why in the world would he do that? - If you were injured, we'd have to.
I'm sorry. What?
what he's saying is, if you couldn't do the work yourself, you would need us to stay.
therefore, he would need us to stay, if he wants the job finished.
if you just burn your hand or something, you know? Just bad enough to sideline you.
if we get pushed out those doors, you are on your own.
you really want to bet your daughter's life on Joseph just letting you go after you hand him the missile?
you can do this.
what do you mean the burner malfunctioned?!
is this some kind of game you're playing at? Is that what this is?
a game? Look at his hand. It was an accident.
just calm down.
do not tell me to calm down!
I'm just saying there's a solution.
I'm thinking the solution here is three graves.
wait. Just listen, okay?
listen. You want your missile. You want your missile, right?
we know the equipment in that lab. He doesn't need his hands. We'll be his hands.
you're looking at the best chip guy in the business. And I know a thing or two about missile assembly.
please.
please. We can do this.
all right, then.
I let them be your hands. And you guarantee no more delays. We have a deal?
Absolutely. We have a deal.
fine. We shake on it.
I suggest you get to work.
okay, Mike. Here's the deal.
we couldn't get the guns in.
and without the guns, we can't make a move, so we're in a tight spot here, no joke.
there might be another way, but it's gonna take some doing on your part.
I'm all ears, brother.
the north side of the plant, near the tanker -- I'm gonna bury two M-4s 20 feet from the fence.
you just figure a way to get there.
I'm on it. Thanks, Mike.
okay. We're all set here. Co2 levels have been adjusted.
looks like we're gonna get the guns after all.
but we're gonna have to convince Joseph to move the fence first.
what? Why?
because that's where the guns are gonna be.
okay, that's crazy.
no, no, no. That can work.
that can work. We tweak the electronics on the missile, blame it on the electric fence.
okay. All right. Let's do it. Let's do it.
it should be me in there, fi.
Yeah, well, it isn't. You're doing everything you can.
the rest, I'm afraid, is on them.
nice.
you could walk right over these and not even know they're there.
there is a fine art to making an electrical malfunction look spectacular and yet not do any real damage, especially when you're dealing with a deadly missile.
just up to the I-O bridge, right? - I got it. Yeah.
okay, now. Be careful.
I'm just saying -- you're touching the warhead to the guidance chips now.
so, one mistake and it's lights-out.
you know, I'm actually already on top of that.
okay.
the trick is to overload a non-explosive component, like the motherboard.
replacing resistors with plain copper wire will amplify the current, overload the circuit, and result in some impressive but relatively harmless fireworks.
okay, are we ready? - We'll know for sure in a minute.
all right. Tell your boss it's testing time.
they're ready.
okay. Here we go.
okay. Show me progress.
well, the guidance chips are state-of-the-art, with special environmental modification software to make sure
all I care about is whether or not I have a working missile that will reach Monrovia from the Sierra Leone border.
I'll let the target worry about how it works.
all right. Guys, turn on the guidance system.
what is happening?! What is this?!
must be an electrical problem.
the circuits are fried. We're getting some sort of interference. I don't know.
I said no more delays!
Yeah, we heard you! We heard you. What? You think we're crazy?! You think we want to get shot?!
come on! Please.
just, we'll go outside, we'll run some tests, we'll figure out what's going on.
all right. You... And you. Let's go.
Yeah. No, it's definitely the electrified fence.
is it? How convenient.
what? - Yeah, the -- the fence is too close to the building, so it's, um
it's causing a power surge. It fried a capacitor already. It'll do it again.
you want your missile? You're gonna have to take down the fence.
you think I am a child? Do you think I will tear down this fence because of your lies?!
okay. Listen. Listen. Okay. How about this? How about this?
just move the fence. Just move it back past the tree line.
that'll solve the problem. You keep your fence, you get your missile, we go home, everybody wins.
fine. We'll move it.
there's nothing quite like searching the home of someone you care about for evidence they've betrayed you.
it's something spies have to do regularly, even with the people they love the most.
it's never easy searching for something as hard as you can and praying you find nothing at all.
Maddy. - Hey.
what are you doing here? - What do you think I'm doing here? Surprising you.
how'd you get in?
Benny... I mean, come on. I've stayed over a few times. That fake rock of yours doesn't fool anybody.
well, why wouldn't you just -- - Why wouldn't I just make dinner for my boyfriend?
salmon. Your favorite.
and for dessert, pecan pie.
pecan pie?
you know me too well, Mad.
better every day, Benny.
I left wine in the car.
and, uh -- would you get it? And I'll set the table.
okay. You're gonna have to remind me to leave the house more often.
that back door is all glass.
if you punch in hard, you should be able to get the attention of all the guards on the first floor.
I'll be fine, Michael. Just get up the stairs fast.
get Sophie out of there.
let me check their position. We'll move as soon as we hear from Sam.
Fi, we got a problem.
they're not in there.
so, they moved the fence. Now what?
I'm gonna run the gauge along it, and when I get to the guns, I'm gonna need a distraction.
well, these guys seem pretty tense. Shouldn't be too hard to get their attention.
I'm gonna take out the guys near me, and I'll get the guns before they know what's happening.
Oh, wait. Check it out.
I thought Joseph wasn't letting any vehicles in.
he wasn't. Something's up.
sir, we need to check the fence.
that can wait. I want to show you something.
Sophie. Sophie! Did they hurt you?
no. Daddy, I just want to go home.
what the hell is she doing here?
well, in my experience, a father always works harder when he knows he's working for his family.
tell me something. Do you love your daughter? Do you want to keep her safe?
please. She's just a child, okay? Please.
do your job. No more delays and excuses.
show me... ...What a father will do to keep his daughter safe.
you have two hours.
get them inside.
there's nothing else I can do. I don't have a choice, okay. I need to just finish it for him.
look, I can't presume to know what you're going through as a father, but handing a completed missile over to Joseph is a bad idea.
I'm done listening to you. He has my daughter. I have to finish.
okay. What's gonna happen then, huh? Think about it.
seriously, man, he's not gonna spring you just so you can go tell the world what he did.
best case, we all get to go to Liberia and make more missiles for him.
what's the worst case? - He decides he only needs one missile, and he kills us.
okay. What the hell do you propose?
I'm working on it. Keep busy and stay cool.
all right. Who cut this tail fin?!
it's 3/8 of an inch too wide! Come on, guys!
Sam, listen. We don't have much time. They moved Sophie.
chances are, they brought her to the plant.
fi and Pearce are scouting the perimeter now.
well, they can stop looking, 'cause Kamba's got her.
so she's still alive? - Yeah, for now.
but Mike, look. Joseph's in a killing mood. He's paranoid about the delays, and he brought the girl in to motivate Resnik.
Sam, listen. There might be a way out.
do you think you can convince him the delays aren't an accident that one of his own men has betrayed him?
like a sabotage play?
kind of a divide-and-conquer type thing?
I can tell the story, Mike, but I don't think I can back it up from here.
remember Ukraine,'97.
you think that could work here?
Yeah. Is 10 minutes enough time?
I guess it'll have to be.
okay. Thanks, brother.
what's going on? We got a plan?
Yeah. 10 minutes from now, don't be near any gas pipes.
Mike's gonna put on a little show for our friend Kamba. I'm gonna go meet with him now.
okay. What can we do? - Is this thing about ready?
well, we have to solder a few more leads.
good. Arm it. Make sure it's ready to blow.
you -- guard guy. I got to talk to your boss now.
an electrified fence can't protect against someone who has no need to breach it.
when you have a network of gas pipes that run across property lines, a well-placed block of C-4 on a gas main outside the fence can cause an explosive chain reaction inside whatever compound that fence is protecting.
was I unclear in my instructions? - No, sir. You were perfectly clear.
we, um... We need to talk alone.
Oh, do we?
sir, I know that I'm risking my life coming here, but I have no reason to lie.
I just need a moment of your time.
out. Everybody, now.
sir, we got to talk about these delays.
now, I know it's something that you might not want to hear, but somebody is working against us, someone on the inside.
from the inside? You mean one of my men?
Yes, sir. I don't know who or why, but it's the only explanation, 'cause your men are the only ones with access.
tell me something.
why would one of my men board a boat in Liberia, cross an ocean, help me build this place, and then betray me?
I don't know, sir. I'm just saying, things are going wrong, and I don't think it's all accidents.
one of your men is
you worry about the missile. I'll worry about my men.
there is no sabotage here, just incompetence!
sir, what's going on?! - The gas lines! Somebody blew the gas lines!
sir, you've got to believe me. Whoever's behind this is making their move right now.
how do I know it wasn't you?
me?! How the hell could it be me? I'm stuck in the lab.
so it's just coincidence that all this happened when you and your friend arrived here?
my friend and I are here to do a job for money.
it doesn't get done, we don't get paid, 'cause we don't work for free.
so maybe... It's Resnik.
sir, please, the last thing you want to do right now is kill the only reason why that guy is still building a missile for you.
so please, sir, let's just try and salvage this situation.
but we need to go now, before the cops get here.
fine. We'll take her.
why are you still standing there? Go put out that fire now.
but you said -- - and now I am saying go. Now, go!
so, do you have a plan to get the missile out?
sir, the missile weighs 900 pounds. There's no way we're getting it out of here.
what? - You don't need this missile. You got us. We'll build you a new one.
it's true. I can get you a lab, anything you want.
don't hurt Sophie, and I'll do whatever you want me to do.
so what happens to that?
that's the beautiful part.
we arm the warhead to blow and leave it behind for whatever son of a bitch was behind this whole fiasco.
that way you'll kill the rat and you get rid of the evidence all in one move.
fine. Do it!
now, sir, when this is done, we're gonna have to stay away from your guards, 'cause at this point, we don't know who's with you and who's against you.
we can shut the power down and sneak through the section of the fence you just moved, but we got to do it now.
okay. We got two minutes, and this thing's gonna blow.
if any of you try to escape, I shoot you all.
now, go!
what's happening? What are you doing?
never mind. Go back to the lab. To the missile.
go! All of you!
now move faster! Or I shoot her in the leg!
all right. All right.
he's watching us too closely to get the guns.
I thought you said that thing was gonna blow in two minutes, man.
I set it for two minutes. I don't know what's happening. There must be something wrong.
I don't know what it is.
now you see how I deal with my enemies.
Oh, yeah? Drop it.
that's how we deal with our enemies.
well, I just got off a very unpleasant phone call with my superiors.
they wanted those weapon specs.
come on, Pearce. That was a pretty nasty missile. I think it's best for everybody that it's gone.
Yeah, about that.
they have a hard time believing that Joseph Kamba blew up his own missile.
well, that's the thing about crazy warlords.
never know what kind of crazy idea's just gonna ...pop into their pop into their crazy, little warlord head.
the job got done, but neither of you made a lot of friends with this one.
giving the CIA half of what they wanted is the Sam Axe specialty.
what's gonna happen to Resnik now that Kamba's been taken down?
I convinced the brass to unofficially help get him and his daughter out of the country.
I'll say this much for you, Westen. You know how to run an op.
what op? We were never here.
it's always difficult eavesdropping on someone you know well or, worse, someone you care about.
the closer you are to them, the worse it feels to listen in on their private moments.
harder still is spying on someone you love who's blatantly betraying you.
ma, you don't have to do this. I'm fine sitting here by myself.
okay. I don't care how long it takes.
I planted that bug. I want to hear what he has to say.
I want to know if it was all a lie.
it's never all a lie.
it's always more complicated than that.
I thought he had feelings for me.
honestly, he probably did.
hello. - You haven't returned my calls.
that must be Anson on the other end.
I've done everything you've asked of me. When will it be enough?
when I say it is. You did take my money, after all.
Yes. I took your money. And I feel terrible.
I'd give it all back if I could. I hurt this woman.
and I think she's starting to suspect something.
now is not the time to panic. Do you understand? - I understand.
did you get the package I sent you? - Yeah, i got the package.
package?
I don't see why I need another wireless mike. The one I have works just fine.
M-Michael! What's happening?!
Yes. I'm opening it.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing No cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am i? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi...
you know spies A bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, michael.
bottom line as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
six years ago, your substitute therapist was anson fullerton.
who the hell are you?
the organization that burned you, i'm the last one of them.
Anson
Anson is the one who killed benny.
you're not the only one he got close to.
you know, michael, you shouldn't be so hard on your old man.
he wasn't quite the poisonous leech you make him out to be.
what makes you such an expert?
all those years, how many times did you wish he were dead?
we did it for you. You're welcome, michael.
a spy's life rarely starts with a happy childhood.
the fact is, the best preparation for a career filled with danger and paranoia is a home life filled with danger and paranoia.
it makes for a complex relationship with the past, under the best of circumstances.
God... I haven't been here since we buried him.
your father would hate this place.
I can just see him yelling at some gardener about all the weeds.
I still can't believe he died to protect you.
mom, we heard that from a murderer who framed fiona for a bombing.
I'm not sure we can take anson's word far it.
maybe not.
but I remember, just before frank died, he was asking about you, out of the blue.
I didn't have time to find it odd.
in a week, I was trying to figure out why he'd gotten drunk and o. d. d on heart pills.
I'm telling you, michael, it fits.
no, ma, listen. This is just anson trying to get into my head.
no, you listen.
I'm not a spy, but I'm not a total idiot.
they used frank to learn about you.
and when he caught on, they killed him.
he was a bad man, michael. But even he had his moments.
Nate's rented a place up in daytona beach for a week.
I'm gonna take off and go up there, take some time, you know, try and get used to this.
how do you get used to this?
you look at me. You have a job to do.
make sure anson doesn't ruin any more lives.
I'm just not...
I'm not sure how to do that.
figure it out, michael.
you do whatever you have to do.
how'd it go?
well, I think I have just the thing to make you smile.
we finally got something on anson I think we can use.
you know how we thought his money was completely untraceable?
well, that spiky-haired weasel barry managed to make himself useful.
I need someone sneaky enough to track the money without anyone knowing, especially anson.
he traced a few mil through half a dozen shell corporations into a Chinese brokerage account, and finally a d. c. Law firm.
fi... - Already packed.
law firms are used to run all sorts of shady businesses for good reason.
they're discrete, powerful, and protected.
between the high security and privacy rules, getting intel from a law office is more or less impossible, unless you're willing to break those rules.
check out the lady in the gray skirt suit.
you think you can match that look by lunch?
you just worry about getting that badge.
excuse me. Can you help me? I am so lost.
I am looking for the Smithsonian I'm a member. - Okay.
first time in d. c. I'm very excited, so I got a little lost.
I was on New York. I made a right on Pennsylvania and a left on Virginia, and somehow I got off constitution.
Oh, there it is Smithsonian. Thank you so much.
can't believe it was right there.
Yeah, no... Problem.
if you can find someone who fits your general description and borrow their identification, the perfect wig and a new pair of glasses can get you a free ticket to look around.
at least until the firm's lawyers get back from lunch.
he's with me.
there's no "anson" or "fullerton" in the client files. You see anything?
nothing useful. Just indecipherable financial documents and property deeds.
keep looking. Might be under a different name.
well, I hardly see any names at all. Just references to other file numbers.
keeping names off documents is a good idea when your clients are running black ops and killing people.
what do you got? Find something on anson?
not anson. But recognize him?
Vaughn
it's been a while.
michael westen, you made a big mistake crossing me.
now you're gonna see what it's like having me for an enemy.
Fi, this file was updated two days ago. It's active.
what does anson want with a man who's locked in prison for life?
find that out, and we're one step ahead of anson.
man, I thought I saw the last of this guy when we sent him to prison.
I mean, you really think he's working with anson?
Vaughn's locked in the darkest hole the government has.
he's not talking to anyone.
which means anson's working on his own, moving vaughn's assets.
Yeah, but these so-called "assets" look just like more meaningless numbers.
I mean, there's no way to know what anson's up to.
unless I talk to vaughn.
excuse me? You planning a trip to Guantanamo?
no, pearce can have the CIA bring vaughn here for a chat.
I need to call jesse, see if his firm can turn these numbers into names.
I don't want to talk to vaughn without doing my homework.
Amen to that, brother.
no, it's no problem, mike. Just send me the documents.
I'll put the research department on it.
and this needs to stay quiet.
Yeah. What doesn't with you, man? Please.
look, I got my friend's retirement...
party right now. I'll check in later.
Yeah.
I thought you said this was a party, man. Where's everybody at?
invitation said a gathering, not a party.
you're the only one that got it, porter.
have a seat.
so I take it there's no cake.
what are you drinking? - Just whatever he's having.
what's up?
question I've heard the stories about what you've been up to since you left CIA, you and that guy westen kicking ass.
those stories true?
Yeah. Yeah. Most of them.
good.
I'm leaving government work, too, and I know somebody that needs an ass-kicking.
it's Yash Ahluwalia, diplomat with the Indian consulate.
state department assigned me to him in 2002.
said they need their "best" working with him.
I spend most of my time sorting out his parking tickets, keeping him out of jail when he roughs up a call girl.
covering for diplomats is kind of part of your gig.
you may not like it, but it is what it is.
and one more thing. I'm helping him smuggle diamonds.
okay. Okay.
if you're doing something illegal, I can't help you.
that's just it. Under the Vienna convention, it's legal.
he does it all under diplomatic cover. Cops can't touch him.
and guess who authorizes it all.
what about your boss? Why can't you just talk to him about it?
I already tried that.
station chief said to hold my nose and do my job. And I did.
until I got tired of waking up and seeing crap like this.
dozens
it's not just smuggling. He's getting away with murder.
listen, jesse, I've seen all the proof.
every time he does a deal, he takes me and the buyer into a secure room.
while I'm filling out documents, I'm sitting right next to all the evidence Falsified certificates, diplomatic pouches full of raw diamonds, all of it.
he's got a sale coming up this week.
if I can get that evidence, I can take him down.
Ian, do you know what you're getting into?
you're gonna lose your job. You're gonna lose your pension. You can end up in jail yourself. This is...
I don't care! People are dying.
I don't want to retire knowing that my life's work was helping this son of a bitch.
please. Jesse.
look, I'm not making any promises, man. I'll check it out.
where can I find this guy?
he's having dinner with a buyer on ocean drive in an hour.
in an hour?
guess I got to make some phone calls.
Ian
audio surveillance is more difficult than it sounds.
taking coherent notes on a half-heard conversation is a challenge.
and aiming a directional mike at a target without being too obvious takes the skills of a marksman.
okay. How are we doing here? - You got the sound up?
Yeah, it's up right here. You're lucky you're a friend of jesse's, because I'm getting a serious crick in my neck here.
is it worth it? Is he saying anything good?
shut up! Your dirty diplomat's finishing his business.
you know, I like the deal.
and the price is a little high, but for what you're bringing me,
I don't mind spending it.
I just want to know that you can deliver. I don't want police or customs.
you know who protects my shipments? The police.
and the u. s. Customs that you're so worried about.
diplomatic pouches are untouchable.
your concern is getting my money.
yash
I'll have it tomorrow morning. 9: 00, soon as the bank opens.
I'll be ready for your call.
Okeydokey.
what? What? What did they say? What? What's going on? What did he say?
bad news. The deal's not next week. It's tomorrow.
so, we have to go in tonight? - Is this guy serious?
that's not how field-ops work, ian. We got to scout. We got to make a plan.
it's gonna take a few days at least. We got to buy ourselves some time.
okay, how about this?
take out the sleazebag in the silk shirt, and while yash is scrambling to put together another deal, - we figure out how to take him out. - I like it.
wait. We can't. Yash will get suspicious if the buyer just disappears.
no, the buyer's not gonna disappear. The money is.
fortunately, he just told us when he's gonna move it.
okay, but, with mike dealing with this vaughn business, all we got team wise is fi.
that's perfect. Robbing a guy in broad daylight That's a fi kind of job.
Michael, do we have an appointment?
friends don't need appointments. This will be quick.
I'm just following up. I made a request...
you sure did. You want me to haul vaughn anderson out of his cage for a chat.
just trying to clear up some loose ends on my burn notice investigation.
that's interesting. Hard to believe a report this thick doesn't tell the whole story.
I wish it did.
I noticed the clearance level on this meeting you want is special access.
so I'm supposed to put you in a room with vaughn, but I can't be part of the conversation?
well, you can make a request.
no, no, no. Don't patronize me.
that would take months, and you know it.
what I want is a guarantee that this request isn't going to blow up in my face.
it's just routine.
there's nothing routine about getting a prisoner transferred from guantanamo.
Pearce, we're on the same side here. I promise.
I'm gonna hold you to that promise.
I'll fly Vaughn to our detention facility in Tampa tomorrow.
thank you.
uh, where do you think you're going?
see this mountain of paperwork?
all of that is for your request. You're gonna share my pain.
you get your own pen.
green
most people assume that the best time to rob someone is on a dark street at night.
but the fact is, a daytime heist has its advantages.
bystanders are more focused on their own business than on what's going on around them.
and, most importantly, the target is less likely to have his guard up.
there's our boy, and his bag looks about $500, 000 heavier.
okay, fi, just make sure the passenger door is unlocked this time, please.
well, you never could take a joke, could you, sam?
daytime robberies do have one major drawback, however.
if a cop shows up at the wrong time, it's a lot harder to hide.
are you kidding me? I'm standing right here. - Oh, great, the cops.
I'm standing right here. I'm right here in front of you. You don't have to keep writing the ticket. Stop.
the moron parked in a red zone, fi. No go. No go.
all right. I got to call jesse, tell we hit a snag.
save the call, sam. I have an idea.
why do I always feel those are the last words I'm ever gonna hear?
don't worry. I'll do the hard part.
meet me at the parking lot behind the Mccarthy building.
and be ready to drive a stick.
the key to manipulating another driver is to make them reactive.
if you want them to speed up, ride their bumper.
if you want them to slow down, box them in.
what's your problem, bitch?
and when you need them to make a turn, steer them towards an obstacle.
it's a lot like dancing...
...at 60 miles an hour into oncoming traffic.
hope you're in place, sam, because we're coming your way now.
what the hell are you doing? Are you insane?
Oh, brother, you have no idea.
Hey, Sweet ride you got there. Mind if I take it for a spin?
wait. Let me get my bag.
sorry.
there's no way.
I thought if we took out yash's buyer, we'd have time to come up with a plan that worked.
come on, mike, the guy's getting rich off blood diamonds, and he's killing people in the process.
breaking into a diplomatic residence that's well guarded even with weeks to plan, it's iffy.
with a few days, impossible.
I thought impossible was what you did.
he's heard a few michael westen stories.
I'm sorry, but it's not about expertise.
even if you could sneak in, the safe you described, it would take hours to break into Hours you don't have.
wait a minute.
what if we're already inside with the evidence and all we got to do is get out?
come on, just humor me, mike. Come on.
well, if getting out was your only problem, you'd have a chance.
actually, a good one.
the back wall of this room is exposed and unguarded.
it also has no door.
with the right kind of blast, you make your own door.
all right, that's it.
I mean, you got to be there with the buyers when the deal goes down.
right? - yeah Okay.
I'm yash's new buyer.
we get in, we take care of yash, get the evidence, and we get out.
yash would never do a deal with some random guy off the street.
he wouldn't be off the street, because you would be introducing him.
well, what do I say? "yash, meet my diamond-dealing buddy.
no, you tell him you're done being a boy scout, and you're ready for a real payday.
but you'd have to sell it.
look, it's your call. If you're not up for it, just say the word.
I'm in.
you think you could use fi and sam on this one?
I have to go up to Tampa.
Yeah, it's not problem. We got it under control.
tell vaughn I said what's up.
welcome back to the citrus state.
shoe's on the other foot now, huh?
Yeah, I'm not here to reminisce. I'm here to talk about anson fullerton.
Yeah, you didn't think I knew about anson. Let's just say he got in touch.
I can't say I saw that one coming.
I'm here to offer you a deal.
your old friend's planning something big.
you help me figure out what, i'll try to make your life a little better.
my life?
I don't think I'd call it much of a life.
I've been in the hole for nine months now thanks to you.
this is the longest conversation I've had since my interrogation.
Anson has been wiring money to a lawyer in d. c. a lawyer you used to work with according to some files that came into my possession.
now it's starting to make sense.
Where's the rest of this file?
you agree to help me, and I'll show you the rest.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
bring me in a bottle of scotch and the rest of that file, and I'll check it out for you.
anything for my old pal michael westen, right?
why the sarcasm, vaughn?
from what I see, I'm the only friend you have.
when approaching an underworld target, you don't get points for being subtle.
most bad guys live in a world where the point of money is to show it off.
it's one of the few times having a blue silk shirt and diamonds on your watch sends the message that you're a good business partner.
you okay?
look, if you're not up for this, now would be the time to tell me.
just blood pressure meds. I'm fine.
how are you doing?
what are you doing here? I told you today's meeting was off.
and who is this?
look, I know why today's meeting's off.
your deal fell through, right?
I brought, uh This is Mr. Ray.
he can be your... New deal. I mean... Buyer.
heard you got some fine products straight from the source.
I am a buyer of bling. Let's make this happen, man.
look, I don't know what you think you are playing at, but you are making a terrible mistake.
and I suggest that you leave now... Before this gets worse.
look, I'm not stupid. I know all about your little side business.
but I'm not trying to rock the boat. I want to help.
all these years, and this is the first I hear of your entrepreneurial ambitions?
look at me.
I'm almost 60. I drive a Taurus.
I live in an old two-bedroom condo.
it's worth less than I paid for it.
I just want a taste... Of this.
fine. I'll meet this buyer of yours.
good. - Go home. now.
Yeah, okay.
come with me. We're gonna get to know each other.
first thing you need to know about me Capricorn.
I'm all about the money, my friend.
so...
you're in the market for raw diamonds.
wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
you'll find my prices on the high end.
but that's because I eliminate your risk.
our man, ian, arranges transport of the product and the payments in diplomatically-sealed pouches.
Hey, if you can take the headache out of transport and delivery I would call that price a bargain, and I would call you my new best friend, okay?
you know, it's unusual to find an American who cuts and polishes his own stones.
that's what separates the men from the boys.
but you must understand, I'm a cautious man, and I need to be sure that you are handling the product in-house.
involving another party is not a risk I wish to take.
I promise that I will not ask anyone for help. Huh?
you can write that in the bible.
well, showing is always better than telling.
I'd like to see your facility... now.
let me tell you something.
you don't need to see a damn thing but my money when we make the deal, you understand me?
trust but verify, my friend.
and in this line of work, it's verify... Or die.
Hey, you want to see my shop. I'll show you my shop. What do I have a damn?
make a quick phone call, set it up.
how'd this happen? - A little camping accident.
my buddy needs his trailer back, pronto. He said you can help.
3 grands. 3 grands will get it good as new.
Oh, come on. 3 grands for a couple of dings?
come on, gus. What happened to the "friends and family" discount?
can't you knock it down to 2?
fine, but only this once, and only because he knows you.
yeah? - Chuck.
Jesse, what's up? Uh, something wrong? - Absolutely. Very much so.
listen, I just want to let you know that I'm gonna be stopping by the shop with a very special, very well-armed customer, all right?
they want proof we can cut and polish rocks. Just spruce the place up.
okay, what? Are you telling me that you need a jewelry store with cutting equipment on the fly?
Yes, yes, right away. Chuck, yes.
okay, um... Okay, I had an ex-girlfriend.
she used to take me window-shopping at a jewelry joint downtown on 3rd felicia's.
they fabricate their own stuff, and they're a little shady, so they might give you a way in.
just take the scenic route, will you?
will do.
Hey, fi? - Yeah.
we should go. Like right now. Yeah. - Okay. Okay.
mind if I finish my wine before we take our little field trip?
when you're operating under a cover i. d. it's sometimes necessary to convince people in the field to support your operation.
often, it's something simple, like asking someone at a restaurant if you can join them for a few minutes while you're doing surveillance.
Hey. How are you doing?
Hey, you're felicia, right, the owner? - yes.
I need to ask you a favor. - Let me guess Engagement rings.
nice try felicia, but really what I want is I want to give you $2, 000 to borrow your store for half an hour.
some requests, however, are a little more difficult.
there's no need for alarms. We're not here to rob you.
do you know who you're dealing with?
how about, uh, ooh, let's say $10, 000 for you to take an early lunch break. Deal?
no deal. I don't know who you are or what you think you're doing, but I'm not ...
okay, look, lady. 20 grand or bad things start happening.
back room now. - Listen, I don't...
go, go, go.
Hey, boss. How are you doing? Who are your friends?
Chuckie, yash, potential business partner.
so you happy, huh? This verified enough for you?
Where's the cutting equipment?
it's in the back.
we're working on something right now, but trust me, the facility's state of the art.
may I? - Now's not a good time.
the problem with relying on untrained civilians is you never know how they're gonna react in a life-or-death situation until you're actually in one.
Hey, ladies. Bob. Say hi to yash.
I believe we're ready to do business, Mr. Ray.
okay, let's go over the plan.
yash walks the two of you into the secure room.
once he opens the safe with the diamonds and the paper trail, - that's when you subdue him. - How do we do that?
with this.
on the outside, ordinary fountain pen.
on the inside, hypodermic needle filled with sleepy-time juice.
once yash goes to dream town, you'll have all the incriminating evidence inside that vault and you'll get out through the east corner right there.
fi triggers the blast. We got a brand-new door to walk out of.
you up for this?
just say when.
making deals with prisoners in covert detention facilities is always a challenge.
the problem is there's not much to bargain with.
no lawyers to discuss plea deals, no judges to reduce sentences.
it's usually just you, the prisoner, and a lot of razor wire.
what is that, 10 years old? You couldn't do better than that?
be glad it's not rubbing alcohol. What do you got for me, vaughn?
this little file you found here, michael, it's got some good stuff in it.
you just have to know how to read it.
I can help you with that... For a price.
and what would that be? - Immunity.
full immunity... To get out of here.
you know I can't do that. I don't have the clout.
you had the clout to take down my entire organization!
sit down! - Easy.
down.
I ain't got nothing to lose.
but from what I see in those files, you do.
you're a can-do boy, michael westen.
show me what you can do... For me.
I don't feel good about this, fi.
I mean, the place is crawling with guards, and we're just gonna let jesse waltz in there with an untrained civilian?
this is his plan, and that untrained civilian is his best way in.
Jesse knows what he's doing.
well, guess there's no turning back now. Clock has started.
let's do it.
if you need to create a doorway in a concrete wall, a breaching frame is a handy tool to bring along.
filled with water and lined with explosives, it directs a charge to surgically cut into a structure.
set it up properly, and it will blast into a building faster than you can say, "open sesame.
that didn't sound good. - I think we might have a problem.
of course, if you can't set it up properly, you might as well knock on your target's front door.
what the hell was that? - Damn it!
there's a reason this wall isn't guarded It's reinforced...
with steel if I had to guess.
okay, so? I mean, that's why we brought the c4, right?
we're gonna need more than that to blast through steel.
then it's a good thing that we have a lot more.
we got to make a door for those guys, and now.
I can take this whole house down, including everybody in it.
I'm not gonna take that chance.
then jesse and ian are sitting ducks.
we come up with a plan "b," or they die.
there is another way we can use the c4.
Hey, easy. Got to buy me dinner first.
it's a pen, fella. You know, for writing words. Come on.
no interruptions while we're doing business.
communication in the field is critical for a mission's success, but it's even more important when an operation's going south.
okay. Where's Mr. Ray?
I got to talk to him right now.
what do you think you're doing?! - Get out of here, man.
what do you think you're doing?! - What am I doing?!
I got to talk to my boss, and I got to talk to him now!
best case, you have a secure line or a system of signals to warn your team without your enemies noticing.
I'm not leaving here until I know that my boss is safe!
not another step.
worst case, you do whatever it takes to get your message across.
if your enemies notice, so be it.
okay, fine, I'll stay right here as long as you get my boss away from mister...
...What's his face. - Ahluwalia!
so if you find yourself in a situation where modern methods of communication won't work...
...you can always send up a smoke signal.
what the hell?!
out! Now!
Oh, my god. You see.
look, you believe me now, fellas?
that's my car!
boss, I got here as soon as I could. Are you okay?
I think your new partner is setting us up.
what? - You're out of your mind!
am I? I did a sweep of our shop, and I found a couple of bugs, as in listening devices
listening devices that weren't there before we did business with you.
you son of a bitch.
I have no idea what this man is talking about.
what happened out here?! - God, it just blew up.
cars just don't blow up, not without bombs attached to them.
lock this place down. - Wait, wait, wait. What about our deal?
get out! Now!
you know that porsche was a lease, right?
Yeah, well, you still got the money. You can buy yourself a new one.
come on. I'll give you a ride home.
if it makes you feel any better, I've been over the entire operation.
they had no choice but to call it off.
it was the only way to keep you guys alive. I would have done the same thing.
taking yash down... It's one thing I wanted to do.
need to do.
give yourself credit for taking a shot, you know? Most people don't even try.
this doesn't have to be over.
Ian, you said yash shipped everything to India after the explosion. It's over.
the evidence is gone.
we can take him down another way. We could get him busted for murder.
what are you talking about murder? Who's he gonna kill?
me. - Don't even joke like that, man. That's not funny.
diplomatic immunity is waived under extreme circumstances.
I'd say murdering a u. s. State department employee counts.
stop talking crazy, man. It's not funny. - No, hear me out. Hear me out!
Jesse, this was never just about retiring with a clear conscience.
I want to do one good thing before I die.
what are you talking about?
pancreatic cancer.
no fixing it. Doc says I got six months... Maybe.
you get news like that, you start thinking about your legacy.
what are people gonna say at my funeral?
I followed orders?
he knew how to give a hell of a toast?
I'm checking out no matter what, and I want to take yash with me.
we're not letting you commit suicide to send someone to jail.
who says you get to make that call? Do the people he's killed have a say?
or do they not matter...
cause they're poor, lived in places no one's ever heard of?
I'm the one who let yash run wild.
I'm the one...
who helped him build an empire.
I'm the one...
who's gonna do something about it.
give us time. We'll find another way. - Yeah, ian
there isn't one. You both know it.
and I'm going for it whether you help me or not.
look, um...
if this is what you really want, then I'm in.
Mike, I don't like this any more than you do, but if Ian's going all in, I'm gonna make sure that it counts.
you start something like this, you need to be absolutely sure you can finish.
never been more sure about anything in my life.
all right, I'll set it up.
I have to admit, Mr. Ray, I didn't expect to hear from you again.
Yeah, well, I wasn't expecting to call.
something changed my mind.
found this bug under a chair in my living room.
want to know who was sitting in that chair two days ago?
man who's trying to kill me Ian covey.
there's no way. I mean, the old man is just a bureaucrat.
he's not the type of person to overreach.
you didn't think he was the type of guy that would ask in on a diamond deal, either, did you?
why would he blow up your car in front of my house?
because he thought I was gonna be in it. It was divine intervention that I wasn't. You...
I had a guy go through what was left of my baby.
he found pieces of an explosive device wired to a timer that malfunctioned.
it was supposed to go off a half-hour later.
I would have been on the road, on my way back to the shop. And the car boom.
so he kills you... And then he kills me.
and the diamonds, the money, they're all in diplomatic pouches.
who gets those when you and I are dead? ian.
you're making some very dangerous accusations, Mr. Ray.
look, you don't have to believe me. Let's talk to ian.
you tell you got some documents or something he's got to sign.
he's got to some through, right?
I'll have him meet us. - Yeah, yeah, let's give him a chance to explain himself.
and, hey, I want to keep this whole thing private, you understand me?
just me, you, and ian until we figure out who's involved.
good afternoon, ian.
I'd like you to come to the house.
Yes, I have some papers.
simulated munitions are a form of non-lethal projectile used mostly for training purposes.
they pack a punch, but they're designed not to do any real damage beyond a welt and some bruising, which means if they're all you've got in a fire fight, you don't have much.
when you shoot jesse, these will be enough to burst the blood packs in his shirt.
he'll collapse and play dead until you're both out of the room.
but they won't help either of you if you get cold feet.
you still don't agree with this, do you?
not too late to change your mind.
Nope, I'm tired of living in a gray world.
my line of work Alliances change, priorities shift.
you wouldn't believe how easy it is to make up good reasons for doing bad things.
sooner or later, you have to see yourself for who you really are.
whatever.
a guy like you fighting the good fight his whole life wouldn't understand.
I understand completely.
I spent most of my life as a coward.
but I'm gonna die a man. Right?
relax, Mr. Ray.
relax?
Ian tried to blow me up. I don't need to relax. You need to wake up.
you thought he was harmless. He almost took everything from you, man.
he was this close to taking everything from you.
well, if that's true, I have men who will make sure he pays for it dearly.
what did I say about keeping this private?
who knows what some stupid-ass guard is gonna do.
no. No, if things get out of control, you got to handle your own business.
believe me, I have dealt with much worse than ian covey.
cops on the way?
Yeah, I called in a domestic dispute. Make sure they're close.
they're gonna be right next door when it goes down.
you okay?
I know. This kind of sucks.
what's going on? - You tell us, ian.
we're trying to make sense of this situation. - What situation?
the one where yash's buyer fell through. Right around the time you came calling on me.
that had nothing to do with me.
you must admit the timing is peculiar, ian.
and you plugged me into yash's deal. But it was a setup, wasn't it?
no, that's crazy. I don't know what you're talking
Oh, don't play stupid, ian.
I found this in my house underneath the chair that you were sitting in.
can you recognize that?
that's how you knew my routine for that day. Lucky for me, your timer didn't work.
you son of a bitch.
you were planning on killing us both.
wait, wait, wait, wait. No, I can explain. - No, I think it's too late. It is time...
whether it's betraying their country or committing a murder, getting someone to make a life-altering mistake is less about logic than passion.
you have to create an environment fueled by emotion, make them rely on instinct...
stop right there, you bastard.
...and make them believe they're in a do-or-die situation.
I got you.
what?
you have something to say?
I got you.
put the gun down!
this isn't what you think. - I said put it down!
it was self-defense. - Hands behind your head!
34-50 east star. Shots fired. 10-52. One victim down.
I am telling you, it was self-defense! He has a gun!
he's dead, and I don't see any gun.
he shot a man inside my house.
go inside and look! There is a dead man in my office!
go inside and see!
Hey. You okay, man?
got to give ian credit, you know?
not a lot of people get a chance to go out on their own terms.
well, that's our cue. We got to get.
Mike, you coming?
Mike? We got to go.
I want you to know that I almost turned around three times on the way here.
this file set some very serious balls rolling, michael.
if we pull the trigger, and the orders in there go through - I'm hoping it won't come to that. - Good. Just understand...
I put myself on the line in a big way here.
I think it's time I hear what's going on.
when we were looking for the people who burned me, even when we thought we had them all, I had doubts.
I wasn't sure it was all over, and I was right.
you're serious? You have hard evidence that the people
Dani, the last person I told my suspicion to was max, and he died in my arms.
I don't want that to happen to you.
so, please, don't press this any further.
what if I want to help?
when it comes to that, if it comes to that, I will tell you, but for now, I need to do this alone.
good luck.
you got my immunity agreement?
I used every trick I could, but I just couldn't get you immunity, vaughn.
then we have nothing to talk about.
don't be like that.
I got you a consolation prize.
you got me transferred out of Guantanamo? No, no, no, no. That's not good enough.
I figured you'd say that, but I did it anyway.
and since I know how difficult it is for you to make new friends without blackmailing them,
I decided to have a few of your old friends transferred here to keep you company.
you remember this guy, Belgian assassin who worked for you.
Vincen-vincent something.
Oh, of course you do. You ratted him out to reduce your sentence.
Oh, and...
you remember this guy. You tried to have him killed.
now I know you guys had a falling out, but you guys have 25 years to patch things up, 25 years to roam free...
in the exercise yard of a federal prison.
just you and your old pals.
you're welcome.
Hey, michael. Michael, look. Look, look. Michael, you can't do this.
no, I really can, but I don't have to if you give me something, vaughn!
now, you read the files. What is anson planning?
is he trying to disappear? What is his play here?
look, those numbers, they're not just bank accounts and blind trusts.
they're linked to real things. - What things?
our organization, it wasn't just run on burn spies.
we had an infrastructure.
we had transport companies and supply depots.
weapons manufacturers, legit businesses, all set up to serve our purposes.
without them in place, we would not exist!
what does this have to do with anson?
Michael, you really don't see it, do you?
Anson isn't retiring. He's rebuilding.
the organization that burned you, he's bringing that back online.
no.
you can try and stop it.
but if I know anson, it may already be too late.
Westen! We had a deal!
Westen, look. You got to cancel those transfers.
I don't know, vaughn. It just might be too late.
my name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing - No cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies - A bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
...and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
that's how we do it, people.
bottom line - As long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
welcome home, kid.
you're gonna help me break in to the British consulate right now.
go get a. 50 cal - Then maybe you got a shot.
I will kill Michael.
Oh, god.
why did you plant the bomb in the lobby?
I didn't. I made one targeted explosive, just enough for Larry.
the security guards - They're dead.
unless you're willing to see your girlfriend go to prison for the rest of her life, you will do exactly what I say.
he'll keep forcing you to do his bidding. There is no end to this.
we just delivered a couple hundred million dollars to a very dangerous man.
I am not losing you, Fi.
I know that you're trying to rebuild the organization that burned me!
Congrats. You're in charge of an official CIA team for the first time since you got burned.
that elite cia team you've been running
they're gonna be my new starting lineup because you're gonna burn them for me.
you want me to betray my own team?
there has to be a line.
there is no line when it comes to you!
we'll go to the FBI, I'll turn myself in, and we'll make them understand.
they won't understand us.
Anson, it's over.
one way or another, it's over.
nobody's getting burned today.
I'll see you in hell!
Pearce, our team has been compromised!
things have changed. There is a new plan.
Michael, that was quite a disaster at the airport today.
I told you what would happen if things didn't go well.
Fi, we got to leave. We got
Sam! Where's Fi?
she clocked me with a bottle. I tried to stop her.
she's turning herself in?
Yeah. Federal building.
she said she didn't want to let you keep working for Anson anymore.
she didn't want to run and let the bastard get away.
she left that for you, Mike.
I'm sorry, Mikey.
I'm so sorry.
I'm here to, uh, surrender.
hands up! Hands up!
back of your head now! Do it now!
back! Get back!
suspect is in custody, over.
suspect is in custody, over.
all personnel, proceed with caution.
secure the halls - now.
suspect is considered extremely dangerous.
I loved you.
before I should have, I trusted you...
cause I've always known your heart.
you do what's right, no matter the cost to you.
and I've learned that when you love a spy, you have to be willing to make that sacrifice, too.
there you are.
been looking all over for you.
is Fi...?
I was too late, Sam.
look, Mike, you can't blame yourself.
I mean, there was nothing you could do. It wasn't like any of us could stop her.
what about you, Sam?
what are you talking about?
you know exactly what I'm talking about.
I - I don't.
you expect me to believe she knocked you out?
how is that possible?
how is that possible?
Mike, come on, man. What do you want me to say?
okay, yeah, yeah, maybe I could have fought her off.
that's right. But did it ever occur to you that maybe she was right?
you were losing yourself, Mike.
you were selling out everything you ever fought for!
I was fighting for her!
by burning spies?
Mike, you were betraying your friends.
you were about to betray your goddamn government.
what do I do now, Sam? What do I do?
I've just been fighting for so long, Sam.
and she was all I had left.
now you're just gonna have to fight a little more.
I got a call from the CIA team over at the airport.
they're working on something.
let's go, mike. This may not be over yet.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, got it.
Mike, that was jesse. I don't want to get your hopes up too high here, but, uh... Sounds like he's got a lead on anson.
What?!
Where?!
Mike, warn me when you're gonna do that?
where is he, Sam?
Jesse's on the CIA system.
he's tapping the traffic cams, and he saw Anson leaving his apartment with a get-out-of-town bag and a fresh shave. Goodbye, mustache.
as of 20 minutes ago, he was heading through midtown in a green JAG.
so, Mike, you know, not to get ahead of ourselves here - I mean, what's the plan if we catch him?
he's the reason why I lost Fi. What do you think the plan is?
Mike, I hate it when you talk like that.
you don't get to argue, Sam!
not on this, not after what happened today.
see what's going on.
Jesse, what's the latest?
you ask, I deliver. I just spotted anson's JAG on a traffic cam in brickell.
he's traveling alone.
good news is, he's minding his red lights, he's going the speed limit.
you should be able to catch up to him. He's heading south on 821.
821 south? You think he's going to Cutler Bay?
that would be my guess, yeah.
with the explosion at the airport, all the flights in and out of miami are grounded.
he's probably trying to hop a boat out of town.
Yeah, but there's got to be 50 marinas at Cutler alone.
I mean, Anson gets there, he's gone.
he's not making it to Cutler bay.
talked to my d. i.a. Contacts.
Anson Fullerton is just a shrink who debriefs field operatives and treats ptsd cas
believe me - he does a lot more than that, okay?
Jesse, I have a rogue agent on the loose, a burning plane on the tarmac, and the F. A.breathing down my neck to release air traffic.
I'm supposed to just forget all that and go after this guy?
Yeah. Look, I know how it sounds. We're running out of time.
he's heading out of town. You got to trust me on this one.
all right, let's just say I did. What would you need, exactly?
Mike and Sam are trying to cut him off.
as soon as they have him cornered, we'll take whatever resources you got.
Jesse, in case you haven't noticed, I'm spread pretty thin.
I'll do what I can, but for now, Michael's on his own.
the vehicle you want when hunting someone down depends on where you are in the chase.
if you're behind your target, you need a set of wheels that's fast enough to catch up.
if you're ahead and waiting for your target to come to you, you may want to think bigger.
Mike, the clock's ticking.
I mean, I thought the idea was to get ahead of anson so we can spot him from the road.
there are no exits for 10 miles along that highway.
it'll be a lot easier if the traffic's stopped.
Oh, great.
anti-theft devices, like transponder keys and transmission locks, make newer trucks nearly impossible to steal.
hot-wiring an older truck, on the other hand, is still just a matter of shorting the terminals on the starter solenoid.
and, of course, dealing with whoever happens to own the truck.
what the hell are you doing?!
Hey, I know this doesn't look good.
no, this guy's stealing my truck!
uh, yeah, he is, but, see, the thing is, it's kind of a long story, and trust me, pal, you don't want to mess with that guy right now.
out of my way!
can't do that.
fight's over. Walk away now.
here. Buy yourself another hot dog.
and, uh, you might want to call your insurance company.
I think you're gonna need a new truck.
Sam, I need you to slow down the cars behind me.
you got it, Mike.
okay, Mike, whatever you're gonna do, now is the time.
keeping a large truck stable is basically about keeping your speed low and your turns shallow so the center of gravity doesn't shift further than the vehicle can handle.
what are you doing?
Oh, boy.
on the other hand, speed and sharp turns are exactly what you need...
...if you want the truck to jackknife.
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
an abandoned semi truck will create an effective barricade.
but if you really want to tie up traffic, it helps to give people a reason to keep their distance.
that's a hell of a roadblock, Mike.
just drive.
ms. Glenanne - Agent jason bly.
I'm not sure if you rember me. I had some dealings with you and Mr. Westen several
I remember you.
Yes. Yes, you clearly do.
I'm on loan here today from the CSS because of my, uh, experience with you and Mr. Westen.
now, I assume you've been informed of your right to legal counsel.
I don't need a lawyer.
that makes things so much simpler.
okay. I hear you want to confess to the bombing of the British consulate.
no. Not exactly.
I set one - and only one - Charge in that building.
my target was a man named Larry Sizemore, a sociopathic CIA agent.
as for the other bombs, I had nothing - Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.
just listen. The man you want - His name is Anson fullerton.
he planted all the other bombs in that building. He framed me for it.
you have to go after him. You need to find him
I don't need to do anything. Maybe you're not clear how this works.
you see how you're chained to the table?
that's how you know that you're not in charge here.
so, how about this?
I ask and you answer.
are you even listening to me? Anson is getting away as we speak.
how many n's in "Glenanne"?
you see what you did? Now I have to start again.
you're sure Anson's in a green JAG?
that's what jesse said. We'll find him, Mike.
he had to have been in one of these cars if he was headed to Cutler Bay.
you got to keep looking.
what the hell do you think I'm doing?
look, Mike, I know you're pissed, but you got to know that I didn't want to let Fi turn herself in.
but she was right - Things were getting out of hand.
you'll never convince me that Fiona giving herself up was the right thing to do. Never.
well, that's why we didn't ask you.
I mean, come on, mike. What's a guy supposed to do when he sees his best friend heading down the path to hell, huh?
help you pack? Speed you on your way?
I knew what I was doing!
what you were doing was lying to yourself, brother. Why can't you see that?
stop the car!
you spotted Anson's wheels?
I think so.
traffic here hasn't been stopped long. He can't be far.
Hey, kid, the guy who was driving this car - You see where he went?
you know that dude?
Yeah, he's, uh - He's a friend of ours.
well, he just, like, bailed on his ride, bro.
headed over there.
bet he's heading to that chemical plant, Mike.
good cover for a guy on the run.
let's check it out.
Mike, who's calling?
I think I can guess.
Anson, where the hell are you?
you find my car yet?
what are you talking about? I'm at the CIA offices, sorting out the mission you just sabotaged.
nice try, Michael. I know you, remember?
a massive accident stops traffic, a massive accident that miraculously injures no one?
you might as well have held up a sign that says,"here I am."
Anson, you are not getting away, and I'm
Yes, yes, you're gonna hunt me down. That's why I'm calling.
I'm not sure that that should be your first priority.
what should that be?
Daryl jordan. He's a former patient of mine and an ex-army ranger.
I treated him for paranoid schizophrenia.
he needed a focus for his violent impulses, so I suggested you.
he's on his way to 947 shady lane right now to... Address his issues.
Mike, what is it?
he should be at Madeline's house in 20 minutes, so you might want to hurry.
I'd hate for you to... Lose Fiona and your mommy on the same day.
pick up. Come on, mom. Pick up.
Mike, hang on a second.
you've just reached madeline - Damn it!
Anson just sent a psychopath to my mother's house, Sam. I got to get back!
just think about it, Mike. She's all the way across town.
you just turned this highway into a parking lot. We'll never get there in time.
I have to try!
Mike, that's just what anson would want you to do.
now, here - I'm gonna call Jesse.
he can get to her a hell of a lot faster than we can.
Mike, we finally got this cockroach cornered.
we're not gonna get a second chance, and you know damn well your mom would tell you the same thing.
Hello? - Jesse, it's Sam.
listen, we got a situation. - What kind of situation?
it's Maddy - You got to call the cops and get over there now.
coming up on "Miami news live,"
startling developments related to last month's attack on the british consulate.
homeland security officials announcing the arrest of an irish national earlier today.
her identity is being withheld, but she did surrender to authorities at the downtown federal building on 23rd street.
it's believed that the suspect will remain in questioning for the rest of the afternoon.
no word on where she'll be held after that or even which jurisdiction will handle this case.
Miami metro police, along with the federal government, expanding their search on those responsible for the bombing.
a number of extremist groups have been flagged for investigation, but authorities have ruled them out as far as involvement.
Miami news live" will report any new information as it becomes available.
hunting for a fugitive in a large area with a lot of cover is less about skill than it is about manpower.
it doesn't matter how good an operative you are.
when it comes to a manhunt, the more people you have on your side, the better.
Pearce, how long before you get backup here?
anson's in the area, but we have to move now.
Michael, not only am I dealing with a burning plane at the airport, I'm dealing with an operation that went completely sideways.
it'll be hours before I can get a team to you, if I can do it at all.
we don't have hours. If we lose this chance, we may not get another.
I can't just snap my fingers and make it happen.
as of this morning, no one at the CIA knew who Anson Fullerton was.
nothing is more important than this!
just give me some support! Do whatever it takes!
sounds like it's just us.
so, Mike, if Anson's in that building, it could take days to track him down.
if we wait for backup, we're gonna lose him.
if he was headed to Cutler Bay to meet a boat, chances are he's already redirected it here.
we probably don't have more than two hours, tops.
your statement is interesting, Ms. Glenanne.
some of it even fits with what we know.
here's the problem. Your story is missing a main character.
what are you talking about?
well, we both know that you didn't kill Larry Sizemore because you were suddenly overwhelmed by the desire to provide free security for the British consulate.
you wouldn't have killed larry unless you had a good reason, like, say... Protecting your boyfriend, Michael Westen.
I'm not with Michael anymore.
Really? I'm surprised to hear that. The two of you were quite the couple.
not to mention the fact that I have documented cases of you two working together as recently as
we have a-a business relationship - nothing more.
look, I understand your desire to protect him.
but I'm not sure that you understand the situation that you're in here.
you're going down for three counts of capital murder.
now, that's a ticket to death row.
but... You tell me truth about Michael, and it doesn't have to be that way.
Michael... Had nothing to do with this.
don't. Don't insult my intelligence.
look, this isn't personal, all right?
I worked with Michael, and he has his moments.
I'm just here to get the truth.
why don't you just tell me - What's it gonna be?
Fiona, trust me - You need a friend here.
I have enough friends. You have my statement.
well, he's not outside the perimeter.
safe to say he went in?
it's his best move. He'd have a place to hide and access to the waterfront.
okay. But how did he get in?
Anson doesn't seem the type to scale a fence topped with razor wire.
maybe he walked through the front door.
well, how's he gonna do that?
Oh, you've got to be kidding.
shot in the back.
he's dead, Sam. He's got to be close.
I repeat - shots fired at the main gate.
one man down. There are two suspects, both armed.
Mike, that voice...Is that - Anson.
looks like we got company.
Freeze!
Oh, crap. Here they come.
well, Mike, I guess the good news is, we found him.
Anson could see us at the gate. He's got to be in one of those windows.
we got to get in there, Sam.
Oh, yeah? How do you propose to do that with our new friends outside?
we're gonna have to go through them.
Mike, slow down. I mean, I know you want to nail Anson
I am not losing him, Sam!
they got both exits covered, and if this is gonna be a bloodbath, I'm out, because the guys outside are just doing their jobs!
even if they are a little trigger happy.
that's probably our best way out of here.
what, getting shot?
something like that.
Oh, Mike, no, no. This is not a good plan. I don't like this plan.
well, get ready to like it even less 'cause I need you to play dead.
I'm hit! I'm hit!
don't shoot! I'm coming out!
come out slowly! Hands behind your head!
don't shoot. I need an ambulance.
I said, hands behind your head!
I can't!
it's almost impossible to escape when you're being handcuffed by pros.
they're trained to work in pairs when handcuffing a dangerous suspect.
Where's the other one?
he's inside. I think he's dead.
on the ground now!
you killed him.
arms out! - I can't move my arm!
one cuffs the hostile while the other covers them both.
even if he can avoid getting cuffed, it only buys you a second before you get shot.
let him go. I will shoot you.
boo. Drop the gun.
please, I got - I got kids.
and we want you to go home to them.
but sometimes a second is all you need.
believe it or not, we're the good guys.
it's Sam. Leave a message.
Hey, man, I'm pulling up to Maddy's.
good news - The cops are here, so I'll call you with an update.
officer.
Hey, you're probably here responding to my call.
thanks for showing up so quickly.
clearing a structure is ideally a team effort.
when you're forced to do it alone, you have to take special precautions, like using peripheral vision to check angles.
but ultimately, no matter how careful you are, there's always one angle you can't see when you're alone - The one behind you.
don't move.
gun down.
where is Michael Westen?
you go first - the woman who lives here - where is she?
you have five seconds to tell me where michael westen is!
okay, just hold on. - 5...
I can help you... - ...4...
...if you help me. - ...3...
hold on, listen to me! - ...2...
just listen to me! - ...1.
hold on!
Jesse, look out!
are you okay?
you let him count all the way down to 1? Seriously?
well, the more he talked, the better my chance of shooting the right guy.
I'm glad you got more than Christmas ornaments up there.
Yeah.
who is he?
an errand boy.
Mike and Sam are closing in on anson.
guess he figured they'd call off the chase if they were worried about saving you.
what about Fiona?
is it as bad as the news is saying?
it's worse.
you again.
look, no matter how many times we do this, my story is not going to change.
I'm afraid you're wrong about that, Ms. Glenanne.
your story has an ending now.
what is this?
there was an accident. A truck spun out of control on the highway.
the gas tank was punctured, and the fuel ignited instantly.
michael was in the cab of that truck.
and he didn't make it.
you don't really expect me to believe you.
no. That's why I had the coroner's report expedited.
look, I'm sorry. I - I really am.
I wish that you didn't have to find out this way.
but I thought you should know before you throw your life away for him.
I'm gonna give you a moment.
and then we're gonna go through your story again.
the truth this time. Okay?
all right, well, security is regrouping, and by "regrouping,"
I mean they're arming themselves to the teeth, so we've got to move quick.
I'm Michael. This is Sam.
now that we're all friends, I have a couple of questions I need answered.
I don't want to hurt you, but that doesn't mean I won't.
stay... Quiet.
how do we get everyone out of this facility right now?
the whole place is on lockdown because of what happened out front.
they're just waiting on the cops to get here.
okay, okay. Shut up. What about a toxic spill?
how do we trigger a full evacuation?
an evacuation?
Oh, god. What are you guys, some kind of terrorists?
come on, it's like I said - We're on the same team.
I'm CIA. Sam here is former S. E.A. L.
look, guys, see?
all right? There's the good-guy patch.
so here's the situation - The guy that shot your friend is loose in this building, and we got to flush him out before he hurts anybody else.
there's a switch for the toxic-spill alarm in the plant manager's office.
we have a winner.
you're gonna take us there now.
but first you're going to get all your friends out of the way.
you need to direct them to the farthest corner of this facility away from where we're headed, okay?
attention all units
we've got a visual on the shooters entering the southeast maintenance annex.
requesting support.
very good. Let's go.
now, sit tight.
believe it or not, it's the safest you've been since breakfast.
when the alarm is triggered on the east side of the plant...
...everyone files out this door.
if I can get here, I'd be able to see everybody leave.
I like the plan, Mike, but you probably shouldn't go anywhere looking like the walking dead.
I need to borrow your uniform.
you got to be kidding me.
you see that look? That look means he's not kidding.
I'll need five minutes to get into position.
what? What?
nothing. Go.
wow, Michael.
Pearce, you made it.
okay. Not sure why I expected anything less than world war III.
there were only so many options for Sam and me.
I'm sorry I didn't get here sooner.
you certainly didn't make it easy on the highway. What's the situation?
Anson Fullerton is in the area, and he's already killed one security guard.
and the air-raid sirens?
we set off the alarm to clear the building.
ma'am, I'm sorry. We have a contamination zone. You're gonna have to clear the area.
Dani pearce, CIA.
who the hell are you? He one of yours?
can we have a word? Let's just...
Mike, good news - I talked to Jesse.
my mom? - She's okay. It was dicey, but she's okay.
any sign of Anson?
no, he wasn't with any of the employees who evacuated.
a lot of places to hide, Mike. I mean, we're talking about a needle in a haystack.
what are the chances he's even here?
I don't know, Sam! But you and I can try to clear the east side of the plant.
Pearce and her team
Anson, we were just talking about you.
I'm flattered, but, really, don't you have better things to do?
go home, spend time with the family you have left.
Yeah, a CIA team has just arrived, anson. You're not getting out of this.
that's good, Michael. Still thinking positively, still focused on your goals.
it's good to have a focus for all that anger.
but I'm afraid you're wrong. Listen to me.
Oh, believe me - I'm listening.
coming after me is only gonna cause you more pain.
I know you think I'm a monster, but the fact is, I don't enjoy hurting you.
so do us both a favor and walk away.
tell them you lost me and say
I'm not going anywhere, Anson. I'm gonna hunt you down, and I'm gonna kill you.
Oh, boy. You're not gonna like the way this ends.
I'll take my chances.
what was that about? - What'd he say?
it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what he said.
what matters is that I heard a turbine in the background.
he's still in the building!
I don't see anything, Michael. Are you sure?
I'm sure. He's somewhere in the building. We have to keep looking.
the CIA is keeping the police clear until they know more about who anson was working with.
we're on our own for now.
fine. I'll get him alone if I have to.
okay. So three guys? Seriously? That's all you got?
to hunt a d. i.a. Psychiatrist on short notice?
Yeah, Sam. I had a hard enough time convincing them not to send a team after michael.
you know, it's not lost on me, by the way, that nobody bothered to tell me about him until now.
no, no, Pearce, you got to understand
this guy had us all over a barrel. Why do you think Fi
there! Right there. We passed a door on the way to the alarm room.
it was open. Now it's closed, Sam.
maybe a worker closed it as they were being evacuated.
no, he's right. Look at the monitor next to it.
it's staring at a wall. Somebody turned that camera.
I heard those mixing tanks over the phone. That's where he is.
okay. So how do we do this?
I'm going after him.
Mike, you can't just barge in there. - Save it, Sam. I'm gonna end this now.
you're not thinking straight! - You didn't hear him gloating!
gloating about how he's gonna walk away from this, how he's gonna take everything away from me!
I'm not letting this son of a bitch - Mike, stand down!
not this time, Sam. Not this time.
put that thing down.
I can resolve this right now, Westen.
I'm not letting someone who's pulling guns on his own team anywhere near Anson Fullerton.
you'll stand down immediately, or you'll take it up with me.
I won't let him get away, Mike.
here.
you man the surveillance cameras.
you see anything, you radio in.
let's go.
an ultra-wideband frequency scanner is one of the newer devices in the toolkit of the tactical breaching team.
it's portable, requires little power, and can see through doors well enough to tell you if they're worth kicking down.
Hey, Anson, we know you're in there.
you know you're trapped, so you might want to do yourself a favor and open up this door.
it'll save us all a lot of headache.
he's probably waiting to take a shot at us when we go in.
well, that's why god made flashbang grenades.
open it up.
under the right circumstances, stress can make you hyper aware - Alert to every detail.
it can also make you paranoid and prone to seeing what you want to see.
Sam, you there?
Yeah, Mike, we're cutting now.
is everything all right?
I'm just gonna check something out.
what is it?
it's probably nothing.
surprised to see me, Anson?
you don't want to do this, Michael.
Oh, yes, I do.
enough!
any closer and your friends die.
it's a dead-man switch.
I rewired a detonator, just in case something like this happened.
just in case you found me.
the whole building is loaded with explosives, Michael.
not to mention the chemicals in the tanks.
if I drop this - If I stop applying the 12. 5 pounds pressure required by the trigger
you'll be scraping Sam and that pet CIA agent of yours off the walls.
you hurt my friends, you die.
you have a choice, Michael.
capture me or save your friends.
back up!
part of growing up is learning you can't have everything you want in life, Michael.
that'd be my ride.
so, what's it gonna be?
I thought so.
Sam, get out of the building.
Mike, what are you talking about? We're almost through!
I just found Anson! He's wired the building to explode! Get out now!
it's a trap. - Then who the hell is in there?
guys, help me knock it down!
Oh, damn it. Pearce, get out of here. Go!
back up, pal.
Hey, ma. How you doing?
I'm fine, Michael.
the police are here.
Jesse told me what happened.
I never shot anyone before.
I'm sorry, ma. I'm really sorry.
and you - Are you okay?
Yeah.
what about Fiona?
she's gone.
I got to go. Ma, I love you.
I love you, too, Michael.
you wanted the CIA to go after Anson.
well, he just hit the top of their "most wanted" list.
good. Now tell them that he framed Fi and get her out.
Michael, it's not that simple.
no, it is exactly that simple.
right now, all we can prove is that Anson tried to blow up my extraction team.
does it help her case? Yes. Is it enough? No.
what if I caught him? Would that be enough?
it's... ...a start.
well, a start's a start.
Sam, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too, Mike.
come on, let's go. We got work to do.
so, this outlines the basics of Michael's involvement.
you can fill in the details later.
for now, I just need your signature.
I want to see the photos again.
why do you want to torture yourself like that?
they were his last moments. Please.
michael lived a dangerous life, and it ended in tragedy.
but now you have a chance to live yours.
you said that the, um... the fuel tank was punctured?
Yes, it ignited, and... That was it.
he never had a chance.
no. No, the sides of the - The cab would have been blasted off...
in a pressurized explosion.
the, uh... The doors are still on their hinges.
this wasn't an accident. Looks more like a roadblock.
you're a liar. Michael's alive.
how could you possibly know that from looking at a photo?
I know explosions. I know Michael.
and I know that we're done here.
I hope that this "business relationship" that you have with michael is worth it.
because from the way it looks, you're gonna die for him.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...Family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
...and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
that's how we do it, people.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
in prison, there is no such thing as good attention.
it's better to be a number than to be known.
take off her restraints.
because with anonymity comes safety.
so whether you're dealing with a fellow inmate, a guard, or the warden herself, the last thing you want is for your name to be on their mind.
inmate Glenanne.
we have a room waiting for you in cell block 9.
that is the wing for high-risk offenders.
see, I heard about the incident between you and inmate Doneski.
so what we're going to do is have you sign a request for protective custody and put you in the segregated wing.
I'd rather not.
I'm doing my best to help you right now.
high-profile prisoners get special treatment around here -- not the good kind.
I appreciate your concern, Warden, but I can take care of myself.
you got a death wish, play it out in someone else's facility.
sign the damn form.
well, it is my choice, isn't it?
can't say I didn't try.
one more thing -- you have a visitor request from Michael Westen.
I don't know how you got privileges so quickly, but if you want to sign this one, he'll be on the list for Wednesday.
hopefully you'll last that long.
when you've been marked for death, hiding is a short-term strategy.
it might buy you time, but it won't solve your problem.
to do that, you need contact.
it means exposing yourself to more potential threats, but it also means having the opportunity to find potential allies.
well, if it isn't the newest resident of cell block 9.
you're Ayn? - That I am.
I heard you can get things.
wine, cigarettes.
or if you're into something stronger, I can make that happen, too.
it's why they call me Ayn -- "anything you need.
someone in here is trying to have me killed.
I need to find out who.
you want to know who's trying to kill you?
damn, girl.
you just skipped all over the small talk.
whatever happened to, "where you from? What you in for? How many years you get?"
ireland, something I didn't do, God knows how long.
can you help me?
info like that doesn't come cheap.
name a price.
see, now, that's where you being new creates a problem.
money around here's canteen credits.
you don't have any.
I'm sure there are other ways to make it worth your while.
there's always favor for a favor.
but I doubt you want to go there.
try me.
dude.
you've checked your watch three times in the last 30 seconds.
it's still...10: 05, okay? Relax.
Pearce sounded a little off on the phone.
she specifically asked to meet here
not the office -- which means something's wrong.
or she knows you're about to visit Fi, and she's got news about Anson.
maybe she found the son of a bitch. Maybe Fi's about to be released.
Oh, I could be wrong.
thanks for meeting me.
what's going on?
I, uh...I honestly don't know where to start.
why don't you start from the beginning?
I came back from lunch yesterday.
there was a message on my phone.
agent Pearce, this is Anson Fullerton.
you've been making life awfully hard for me lately.
now, I'm sure Michael's filled your head with lies, but I am not the monster he makes me out to be.
and to prove it...
I'd like to offer you an olive branch.
I had a chance to read your personnel file, and I noticed you spent many years trying to find out what happened to Jay Toonberg.
I'd like to help.
what the hell's he talking about?
Jay and Pearce were engaged.
Oh, I'm sorry.
this was waiting for me at home.
his name is Ahmed Damour.
meet the man who murdered my fianc.
it's all right there.
Jay was working undercover, gathering intelligence on the Syrian military.
his cover got blown, and before they could pull him out, Ahmed killed him.
and the best part -- now he's the CIA asset.
he's getting rich selling us the same intelligence he stole from Jay, and we're protecting him.
so this murderer's living the high life in Bermuda on the Agency's dime.
that is nice work if you can get it.
talk to your boss about it yet?
Oh, no, I can't.
I'm not even supposed to know that file exists.
they'd just order me to let it go.
but I can't do that.
has it occurred to you that Anson knew Ahmed was protected when he dropped his name?
he knows you're helping us get Fi out of prison.
he wants you to throw your career away.
I get it, Westen, but some things are more important than a career.
you're not the only person who ever lost somebody.
so, what? - What?
it's an eye for an eye now? Come on, Pearce. That's not you.
it is when that's the only option.
Pearce, it's not the only option.
the Agency is only protecting Ahmed until they get their intelligence.
we take away those secrets, we take away his protection.
he goes down. You don't. We can help you do that.
I promise.
hate to say it, Mike, but I think your mouth wrote a check that your butt can't cash.
I mean, you see the section here where the CIA says Ahmed is untouchable?
I think that means, you know, "no touching."
maybe you missed this page.
the CIA doesn't care about Ahmed.
they care about the intelligence.
he's got all the files on a hard drive.
once we find that drive, we turn it over to the CIA they'll wrap him up.
Yeah, no, I definitely saw that page, just like I saw this one here.
agency sent a team into his Bermuda compound back in '08 looking for the hard drive.
they didn't find it.
I mean, what makes you think we can?
Sam, if I don't help Pearce, she's gonna ruin her career.
without her at the Agency, I'll never get Fi out of prison.
okay, well, wait.
it says here the guy's getting ready to take a cruise.
maybe you isolate him on the boat -- make him think that he's sick.
if he doesn't think he's gonna make it...
he's gonna start talking.
and the first person he'll call is his son, Sharif. - Son, Sharif.
back in Bermuda. It's perfect, Sam.
so perfect it's not gonna work.
we don't have the manpower.
you got to have three on the cruise, three on the land side, and if the CIA can't know about this, well, they're not gonna pitch in.
I can get you a team.
who -- Nate and your ma?
you're not kidding, are you?
look, Mike, nothing against the Westen clan, but I'm gonna be real glad when we get Fi out of the clink.
just pick a book, bitch.
you know you can't read.
press on, honey.
is there anything you can't get in here?
if the price was right, I could stage a Beatles reunion concert in the main yard.
all I need is a name.
Yes, you do.
and a pricey one at that.
I'm all ears.
tomorrow at 2: 15, I need that door locked tight, and I need it to stay that way for about two minutes.
you do me that favor, and I'll help you find out who's trying to kill you.
doing it without getting caught would be almost impossible.
I can't risk going to segregation.
I thought that might be a deal breaker.
no hard feelings, honey.
I said "almost impossible."
get me these supplies, it's a deal.
that's a hell of a shopping list.
it's a hell of a favor.
magnesium?
overnight?
honey, I'm good, but I'm not magic.
what about a sparkler?
you know, this breaks one of my rules...
but I might decide to like you, criminal.
so, when we're following this Sharif kid all over Bermuda, where you gonna be?
I'm gonna be on a cruise with his dad, Ahmed.
trust me -- it's not for pleasure.
okay, you've got your cover I. D.s, tickets, traveler's checks.
you're on the 9: 25 out of Miami.
Sam will go over the rest when you get there.
and is he going to tell us what this is really about?
ahmed has valuable information, and we need to get it back.
I heard that part.
if this was just about stolen secrets, you wouldn't need Nate and me.
come on, Mom.
you know how this works.
the details are probably, like, classified or whatever.
can't you just be happy helping out Mike?
this isn't watering someone's plants while they're out of town!
you're asking us to fly to another country with a fake I. D. dealing with spies at the drop of a hat!
I want to know why!
is this about Fi?
no, Mrs. Westen. This is about me.
ahmed didn't just steal information.
he killed my fiancé.
but the CIA doesn't know we're going after him.
if you don't feel comfortable coming along, I totally...
honey, please, just stop.
I'll do it.
effective interrogations take many forms but usually include three key elements.
first, you need a target with the intel you're after.
then you need an interrogation team.
their job is to secure the target and do whatever it takes to obtain actionable intelligence.
but getting useful information doesn't matter if you can't move on it.
which is why you need a support team in the field.
okay, Mike, you got the murderer.
we'll get the son of a murderer.
hope you took your Dramamine.
Thanks, Sam. We'll call you when we have something.
and, of course, the whole system breaks down if someone kills the target before he can talk.
Pearce, you should look like you're ready for a fun vacation, not trying to kill someone.
I just want that son of a bitch to suffer like Jay did.
don't worry. In about six hours, Ahmed will wish he was dead.
but the plan only works if you can hold it together.
this better? - Yes.
look, we need to run a stat blood series.
stat blood series -- CBC, CMP P. T. and a PTT...
don't forget a BOT and a PB&J, A.S. A.P.
Fiona usually would help me with this.
you're good, man. You sound like an infectious-disease specialist. You got it.
hope you got that prazosin ready.
ready to make a grown man cry.
Where's Ahmed?
in the casino, playing craps...
making sure all the ladies see his $50, 000 Rolex. It's disgusting.
Pearce. - I'm smiling. See?
we do have one little complication, though.
ahmed's bodyguard is hovering around him like a helicopter mom.
the guy does everything for him, including getting his drinks.
so if we're gonna poison him there, we might need you to give us an extra distraction.
I would love to, but we can't risk Ahmed seeing me before he's in the infirmary.
Jesse can sell this.
please. I could do this by myself if I had to.
go get your party dress on.
it's all how you shake them.
you got to let them know you love them, okay?
all right.
how about a little kiss for luck?
you see what I did?!
then you let them know you love them.
I love you.
and if you love something, what do you do?
you set it free!
that is how you throw the bones, my friends!
I hope you enjoyed my drink.
that's $100 a shot, you idiot.
my bad, man.
but you know what? There's still a little bit left.
do you want to finish it?
next round's on me.
okay, what is that -- Jack? Old crow? What you got?
Johnnie Walker Blue on the rocks.
Ooh, excuse me, mister!
Johnnie Walker Blue on the rocks.
sexiness!
can we get a nice, fresh refill for my man?
Johnnie Walker Blue on the rocks.
I'll get it.
personal bodyguards are specifically trained to identify and prioritize potential threats...
Johnnie Walker Blue.
...which means getting their attention is usually as easy as becoming the most immediate threat in the area.
you know what? Give me those.
my turn. You got bad juju.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
I'll tell you what I'm not doing
I'm not trying to sit here and see how many times one man can roll snake eyes, okay?
you had your turn.
give them to me.
you know what? Fine, fine. You want to burn down the house?
have at it.
I'm pulling the rip cord, baby.
poof!
how long till he drops?
I don't know. It depends on how fast he drinks his...drink.
shouldn't be long.
the difference between a drug being called "medicine" or "poison" comes down to one thing
dosage.
the recommended amount of prazosin will effectively regulate blood pressure.
but taking too much will trigger side effects that mimic the symptoms of an extreme viral infection.
once they kick in, instead of doubling down, you'll be falling down.
that's a good look for him.
Oh, more pleasure reading, huh?
Yeah, I love reading "the principles and practices of infectious disease control" in my spare time.
well, you're gonna have to tear yourself away.
it's time to roll.
Yeah, we just checked out the infirmary
whole lot of nervous people down there trying to figure out what's wrong with Ahmed.
perfect. Let's fill in the blanks.
I still wish there was a way you didn't actually have to take those.
you and me both, sister.
but the disease is supposed to be infectious, and I can't fake a fever, increased heart rate, and dilated pupils.
at least I only have to take it once.
Mike, can you water me, please?
Jesse, I can't thank you enough.
Yeah, well, just try to keep me away from that long tunnel with the bright light at the end of it, will you?
Where's the ship doctor?
we need help here!
I'm Dr. Winnick. What happened?
Dr. Winnick, I'm Dr. George Penderson, CDC.
my wife, Jeannie, and I heard passengers screaming for a doctor.
we found this man convulsing in the hallway.
his name is Jamaal Howard, age 36.
no medical alert, ID. s, or cards.
they said he was complaining of blurry vision and dizziness.
he's got elevated temp and heart palpitations.
get him set up in sick bay 2.
get his vitals, and get him on O2.
what?
we have a passenger who came in with the same symptoms.
how long ago exactly?
about nine hours or so.
Why? What are you thinking?
you've got a serious problem on your hands.
something's going around, and it's not food poisoning.
based on the symptoms, it's meningococcal.
Yeah, that's right.
well, thank you for bringing him in, Dr. Penderson.
we can take it from here.
can you? Have you ever implemented quarantine protocol?
well, no -- well, I have on three different continents.
and, trust me, you don't want to be on the hook for a full-scale outbreak.
you're lucky it's not airborne.
you still have a chance, but you're gonna need our help.
wait a minute, Dr. Penderson.
this is my infirmary.
I call the shots.
I'm sorry. I'm...not trying to big-dog anybody.
I'm CDC.
it's just what I do for a living.
use me. I'll treat the infected patients.
you just take care of the rest of the ship.
Yes, but the ship regulations require me.
it's your call.
you make the wrong one, people die.
listen up, everybody.
this infirmary is now in quarantine.
Kim, I want you to set up a temporary exam room across the hall stat.
this area is now off-limits until Dr. Penderson says otherwise.
come on! Let's go! Let's move!
I need you to run a stat blood series, including a CMP, CBC, P.T. and a PTT.
that man you brought in.
you know him?
I saw him at the casino last night.
he took my drink.
he drank from your glass?
that must be how you infected him.
what?
Mr. Damour, my name is Dr. Penderson.
I believe you've been infected by a highly contagious and very deadly strain of meningitis.
and it looks like you gave it to Mr. Howard.
W-what are you saying?
first of all, it means you're under quarantine.
you -- you need to wait outside.
we'll test you and seclude you until we know you're clean.
now, w-wait, wait. Did you say "deadly"?
don't worry.
we'll do all that we can.
now, I need a list of everyone you've been in close contact with in the last 48 hours.
my son, Sharif.
doctor, we've got Mr. Howard stabilized.
thank you.
this is my wife, Jeannie.
don't worry.
we're going to take good care of you, Mr. Damour.
now, I need you to call your son.
we'll have someone sent out to your home to test him.
not my house.
I'll have him meet them.
it's better that way.
I don't think you understand what's at stake here.
I'm a very private man.
I can't have strangers coming into my house.
Mr. Damour, in situations like this, the most important thing is finding the origin of the infection.
if it's in your home, your son is in grave danger.
we're not trying to invade your privacy.
we just want to do what's best for you and your son.
fine, fine, fine.
I'll tell Sharif. - Good.
they got a saying in here -- never turn your back on an open cell door.
Oh, look at you.
you got your own little early-detection system.
six-pack, three cans of tuna, plaster, a nail file, and your damn sparkler.
you know how hard it is to get fireworks this time of year?
I need one more thing.
the guards change shift every day at 2: 15.
and I take my afternoon tea at 4: 00. What's your point?
why do you need me to clear them off the block at that time?
I'm throwing a party, and I can't have a guard interrupting the fun.
if this is a hit, then I'm out.
you really think you're in a position to call the shots here?
or maybe you just don't care who's trying to kill you anymore.
that it?
Oh, I care, but there is a line that I don't cross for anyone, Ayn.
that's why I'm here in the first place.
and here I thought you were in here for murder.
okay, criminal.
can't promise everyone's gonna end up smiling, but nobody's gonna end up dead.
convict's word.
you still in?
Yeah.
one of the easiest and most efficient ways to make incendiary devices begins with mixing aluminum powder and plaster of paris.
once dry, it burns at about 3, 000 degrees and can melt solid steel in under a minute.
it's also completely stable and safe to store until it's lit, which is important because nobody should handle a deadly incendiary without a good night's sleep.
Hi, we're from W. H.O. here to see Sharif Damour.
one moment, please.
okay, Maddy, remember, when we get in there, you got to keep this guy Sharif busy long enough for us to find the office and bug the phone.
didn't you say this guy's some kind of a sociopath?
Yeah, he does have a few assaults on his rap sheet, but, uh, he seems to prefer beating up waiters and call girls.
mom, you're pretending to be a nurse.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
okay, and we are transmitting.
Maddy, that's for you.
you want me to get him to wear this?!
you said it was a watch!
why didn't you just ask me to tie a brick around his wrist?!
Maddy, I'm sorry, but it's got to be big enough to hold a GPS, so it's either that or we convince him that pagers are back in style.
let's do it.
you the outbreak people?
Yes, sir.
Dr. Chuck Finley.
Where's your little astronaut suits?
uh, well, the virus isn't airborne.
well, you sure scared the hell out of my father.
he made it sound like the guys from "E. T." were on their way.
Yeah, let's go.
let's get this over with.
we'll move as fast as we can, Mr. Damour, but we need comprehensive sampling of this house, and you need to be examined immediately.
Shelly, he's all yours. - Yeah.
whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on, hold on.
he'll go with you -- make sure you don't get lost.
don't worry. We'll move as fast as we can.
I'm telling you this is a waste of time.
do I look sick, huh?
come on. I take care of mys-- Open your mouth.
you look fine now.
but changes happen quickly with meningitis.
hiding trackers in accessories is a go-to trick for spies.
jewelry and watches are attractive options, but there's always a risk they'll clash with the target's outfit and get left at home.
105 beats a minute.
is that bad?
I'm gonna have to ask you to wear a monitor...
on the other hand, a tracker that the target believes might save his life is always in fashion.
...at all times.
what do you mean, "all time"?
what if I go to a club?
you wear it.
in the shower?
at all times.
well, that's ridiculous!
if my heart speeds up, I'll feel it!
Really?
most people don't feel their heartbeat until it hits, oh, around 130.
and by then, you will have swelling of the brain, subcutaneous hemorrhaging, and will be convulsing so hard you will not be able to dial a phone.
fine, fine!
Just...until the test results come back.
this room is clear.
any positives?
Nope.
Hey, this room's off-limits.
Oh, really?
well, I'm thinking that the virus didn't get that memo.
we have to check everything.
excuse me, sir.
gram staining is a method of testing for the presence of certain types of bacteria.
positive results turn purple.
negative results turn pink.
if you need a positive result on a gram test, there's no need to bring in a lethal microorganism.
a little yogurt will do the job.
and, of course, no matter what color a slide turns, nothing sells "scary" like a big reaction.
Oh, my God. Look at that reading.
have you been in this room recently?
why are you still standing there?!
get to the nurse! Go! - Go!
wire it quick, Nate.
Yes, I will.
look up.
down.
right. Left.
right again.
what is this, dance class? Enough of these tests.
these are necessary, Mr. Damour.
no. I'm done.
what happened to our guests?
they think I might be infected.
they said to come see Nurse Shelly.
and you left them where?
in the office.
you left them in my father's office?
stupid!
stupid!
Mr. Damour, we're not finished!
no, this exam is over!
whoa, you can't go in there!
no, you can't be in there!
sir, it's dangerous!
dangerous! - Get out of my way!
what the hell are you doing taking apart that telephone, huh?!
come on. - I'll tell you what he's doing.
he's handling some highly infectious bacteria!
that's what he's doing.
got to take it apart to check it.
exactly.
I mean, this thing is filled with bugs, and I'm talking nasty stuff.
have you used this phone?
maybe a few times.
okay.
then I suggest you pray.
pray.
grab the gear, Chuck. I'll meet you outside.
Oh, more jelly!
delightful!
sorry.
you get what Ahmed gets.
how's it coming?
let's see.
testing, testing.
I want real food.
one, two, three.
I want real food.
broadcast quality.
and now that we've got a tracker on Sharif, you and Mike can give Ahmed one final push.
Yeah, you know, maybe it's...
best if Michael finishes this.
I'm not sure I can -- No, no, no.
don't start talking like that -- not now.
I am trying not to. I really am.
but I feel like if I go in there one more time...
I'll kill him...
or break down completely.
I know this is a rough one.
you got to figure out a way to hold it together, okay?
we're almost done.
you don't understand. - I don't?
my mom was on the wrong end of a stickup.
they never found the guy that killed her.
first thing I think of every day is her.
the second thing is how I wish I can get the guy that did it.
you have that chance. Dani, look at me.
you're gonna finish this.
if you don't, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
trust me.
I know.
okay. - Okay.
you ready to bring this home, or what? - Yes.
good. 'Cause I'm sick of this damn jelly.
stop whining, Porter. You sound like a little girl.
have you heard anything about my son?
is he infected?
we're still waiting to find out, but Sharif isn't showing any symptoms for now.
Mr. Damour, we just got the results on the samples from your house.
I don't know how to ask you this, but do you know of anyone who would want to hurt you intentionally?
what are you saying?
the strain of the virus they identified is...
man-made.
our techs found abnormally high concentrations on your phone, your car keys, your toothbrush.
someone deliberately infected me? Who?
we don't know, but, unfortunately, that is not the worst part of it.
there's no easy way to say this.
I'm afraid your condition has advanced beyond the point of us being able to help you, and...
you're not going to make it.
you mean I might not.
there are miracles...sometimes.
but with something like this -- Get out.
get out!
I don't want to see you.
please. There must be something you can do.
Mr. Damour, I know this is tough to hear, but Dr. Penderson's right.
how much time?
if there's anything you need to take care of, anyone you need to talk to...
...now is the time.
that's impossible. They said you were sick, not dying.
can't they give you medicine?
they found the virus all over my things.
whoever it was...
they were trying to kill me.
I don't understand. Who would do this to you? Why?
I don't know! No one knows.
it was probably the CIA.
they've always hated me.
it doesn't matter now.
I want to make sure that you're
wait, are you -- are you saying...
y-you're not coming home?
answer me.
do you remember what to do?
Yes! I remember.
good. I want you to secure your future.
I want you to do it now.
I will.
where are the files?
they're at Habibi's place.
fourth shelf of the remline chest.
how soon can you get there?
I'll go first thing tomorrow.
good.
and call me when it's done.
I will.
Hey, criminal.
don't you have an errand to run?
breaking my concentration.
sabotage is best done in private, when no one is around to see it.
if you don't have that luxury, you have to take certain precautions.
it's crucial to conceal the real reason for your movements so that people don't get suspicious.
you know, I could use an extra blanket in my cell.
requests have to be made on Monday to the unit manager, Glenanne.
well, what am I gonna do till then, huh?
Hello?
wait, are you telling me that I have to spend another week freezing my ass off in here?
it's also a good idea to use time-delay devices so that when the fun starts, you'll be nowhere near it.
you still haven't moved.
door's jammed.
I can't get it open.
code 6! Code 6! Cell block 9!
officer needs assistance!
all this for a robbery?
robbery?
you think I need those scraps?
this was business, honey.
my little friend over there got the notion she could open up shop on my block.
I had to let her know that market conditions weren't conducive to expansion.
breaching.
all right!
you know the drill!
everyone against the wall!
eyes forward!
hands down, God damn it! Hands at your sides! I said eyes forward!
we got some action.
doesn't look like junior's planning on coming back anytime soon.
too bad the guy doesn't know his final destination.
you don't have to pack that heavy for Gitmo.
hold your little horses. We're not going anywhere.
don't want to be up the guy's butt.
cause then what happens?
he sees you.
we lose our chance of getting that top-secret intel.
now we can go.
okay, they definitely pulled in.
right there.
they're keeping their top-secret files in a boathouse?
Yeah, it's not a bad plan -- put all your top-secret goodies in the same place as your go-fast boat.
makes it easy to blow town.
and that's why we're gonna bust in on their ass and make sure that doesn't happen, right?
Yes, Nate, but when you say things like that, try and say them like you understand how dangerous they are.
let's do it.
a successful ambush can end a battle before it ever begins.
to pull one off, you need two key factors.
the element of surprise and superior positioning.
okay, Nate, you follow my lead.
you don't make a move until you see the intel. You got it?
Yeah.
the best staging areas offer a clear view of your target while providing plenty of cover for you.
not yet.
of course, it doesn't matter how good your position is if you're the one who gets surprised.
what the hell's going on?
just get down.
sharif, it's a glorious day, no?
I've had better.
what?
smile.
you're about to be a rich man.
shall we toast?
no time for drinks, Yevgeni.
as you wish, friend.
go on - First, we verify.
then we pay.
dude, who are these guys?
Nate, I'm no expert, but it looks like Sharif is making a deal with some Russians.
Russians?
why would Russians want those files?
Oh, these guys are working for themselves, not their country.
I mean, this is business.
okay, what's our next move?
we don't have one.
come on. Come on.
that was quick, Sam.
Yeah, Mike, this is not the victory call.
this is the, uh, "you know what hitting the fan" call.
sharif is making a deal with a crew of FSB rejects.
it's going on right now. - Russians?!
Yeah, it's like a Cold War class reunion.
can you put the brakes on it?
it's five against two, and they're packing more heat than we are.
but, you know, sure, what the hell? We can try.
no, Sam. Sit tight.
it's too dangerous.
so, they're gonna do what?
just sit there and let Sharif sail away with even more money?
they make a move, they're dead.
then we have to make a move.
we will, but not right now.
we have to hold off until-- No, we are not holding off.
we are ending this right now.
Pearce, what do you think you're doing?
I have a play here, Westen.
back me up, or stay out of the way.
I don't care, George!
he deserves to know!
honey. - If you won't tell him, I will.
tell me what?
my husband got a call from the CDC.
they've traced the origin of your virus.
it -- it's classified information.
we've been ordered not to tell you.
please.
whatever it is, I'm dying. I need to know.
my feelings exactly.
the virus you have is known as the St. Petersburg strain.
it's weaponized.
it was developed by the FSB -- Russian intelligence.
Russian?
are you sure of this?
positive.
the protein signatures leave no doubt.
get out. Please.
I need to make a call.
I have to take this.
Hello, papa?
did he say "papa"?
I think they're making a play back on the boat.
I'm fine. I'm at Habibi's.
we're doing the deal right now.
no, Sharif.
it was them! It was not the CIA.
it was the Russians!
how do you know?
the doctors traced the virus.
it was the FSB!
those dogs planned this whole thing out!
they're killing me for the files.
you need to get out.
now!
don't worry, papa.
I'll make sure tell them you said hello.
that was Ahmed?
how is he?
doing quite well, considering.
he said to give you a message.
okay, Nate.
time for us to get in the game.
be ready. - For what?!
when I get close, shoot in the air.
yevgeni, maybe you will see my father in hell, huh?
Nate, I said, "shoot in the air."
you didn't say, "up in the air."
Yeah, Mike.
this is the victory call.
we got good guys up, bad guys down, and the files in hand.
it's been too long.
my son should have called by now.
it's a terrible feeling, isn't it?
I used to talk to my fiancé twice a day.
then one day, he didn't call.
that's how I knew something was wrong.
he was a scientist working in Paris.
the last time I spoke to him, he was filing a report about a Syrian satellite installation outside Masyaf.
you. - Yes.
me.
I was just trying to scare him.
you shot him in the back.
it was a mistake.
No! It was a choice.
and for every choice, there's a price.
so the price is you killing me with this virus?
no. There's no virus.
we have the information you murdered Jay for.
we have your son.
and we have you.
I'm not killing you, Ahmed.
but believe me...
your life is over.
I wish you'd relax, criminal.
wears me out just looking at you.
just tell me you got something.
whoever it is tried to kill you is working with a dirty-ass guard.
well, what's his name?
hold on, now. Before I provide that information, you need
quit with the games. You tell me his name now.
easy now.
I'm trying to protect both of us here.
can't have you broadcasting a guard's name over the visiting-room phone. Okay?
just write down what you want your boyfriend to know.
I'll make sure it gets delivered.
works better for both of us.
sorry. - Yeah, well...
place changes all of us sooner or later.
looks like sooner for you.
now you see why I never wear orange.
you look beautiful.
I'm gonna get you out.
I promise you that.
and we're -- we're getting close.
the CIA -- I love you, too, Michael.
we don't have much time.
I don't want to talk about that.
you know what I was thinking about the other day?
that little dingy bar in Belfast -- the Black Sand Pub.
you mean where we met.
and I made the mistake of asking...
..."Would you like to dance?"
then you pulled a snub-nose revolver on me.
that I did. And you said...
I assume that means yes.
excuse me, sir, you dropped that.
no, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
Michael, someone is trying to have killed in here.
on the back of this note, you'll find the name and address of a guard who's working with them.
do what you can.
please hurry.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...Family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
...and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
that's how we do it, people.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
I'm gonna get you out. We got a lead.
if I get Anson, would that be enough to get Fiona out of jail?
it's a start.
I can be done with you right now.
maybe you should just go ahead and pull that trigger.
you can just add me to that list of bodies you've been dropping. Shut up. Shut up! I said shut up!
I work for Anson because if I don't, my brother dies.
Rebecca, listen to me. You hate Anson.
you hate him at least as much as we do. I saw it in your eyes.
help us take Anson down. We'll keep your brother safe.
sorry, Sam. It's too late.
I know what it's like to save someone close to you by selling your soul a piece at a time.
there's only one way to finish this for good.
we have to take him down together.
there's nothing you can do.
you're wrong. There's nothing I won't do.
in many ways, being a spy is just like any other job.
you get a paycheck, go to meetings, return phone calls.
and if your supervisor invites you to a fancy lunch without telling you why, it's either very good news or very bad.
you're 30 seconds late.
my training officer would have booted you out of the Agency for that.
tell you what - I'll make it up to you.
drinks are on me.
why don't you tell me why I'm here?
I forgot how much fun you are.
there is news on your whole "Get Fiona out of jail" project.
why do I get the feeling there's a "but" at the end of this?
there always is, isn't there?
the C. I.A. would like her to prove that she is a friend of the Agency before they're willing to talk terms of a deal.
a friend of the Agency.
relax, Michael. They just want her arms supplier.
that wasn't what we talked about, card.
well, the consensus was that your panties would be in a bunch over this.
that's why I'm here to see you personally.
that's why I'm buying you $18 drinks.
and that's why I can tell you this -I can still make this happen, but I need you and her to play ball, and I need you to help convince her.
do I have a choice?
not really
not if you ever want to see your girlfriend again without a pane of glass between the two of you.
well, I guess, then, I'm in.
Sam, there are chairs inside, you know, where it's not 100 degrees.
Yeah, I'm giving Rebecca some space.
I'm kind of terrified of that look in her eyes, when things aren't going her way.
still haven't found her brother?
Yeah, I'm all buddied out, Mike -I mean, FBI, NSA, Interpol.
the whereabouts of Mr. Trent Lang are a mystery to us all.
is she still keeping everything close to the vest?
Yeah. She won't say anything about where he disappeared from or what spooked him, so for all I know, the guy wandered into the wrong section of Bed Bath & Beyond.
all right, I'll go talk to her. - Yeah, good luck with that, brother.
Rebecca, we need to talk about your brother.
you can't find him, can you?
I seem to remember sparing your life so you could.
you haven't given us much to go on.
I already told Sam I'm not letting you gamble with my brother's life.
this thing with Trent is delicate.
and I'm telling you that I specialize in delicate situations.
try me.
fine.
let's just say there are some very dangerous people after Trent.
Anson found out where Trent is hiding, and he said that if I don't do his bidding, he'll tell these people where Trent is.
finding your brother might not be the only answer.
these very dangerous people might be a good start.
I'm asking you to trust me.
how can I do that?
how do I know you'll keep your promise?
until he met me,
Anson Fullerton was running an international conspiracy with hundreds of operatives and billions of dollars.
and then I swore to take him down.
now he's off hiding in some spider hole under an assumed name, and you're all he has left.
so, you go ask him if I keep my promises.
last time I saw my brother was in that club.
he liked to dance? He tended bar? I need a little more here.
Trent was hired to do payroll.
a few months in, he figured out it was just a front for a criminal syndicate.
he tipped off the cops and slipped town?
Yeah. The police busted the boss for racketeering.
that's Wes Foster. It was his dad who went to prison.
so, Wes took over the family business, and he's picked up a new hobby, which is hunting my brother.
he's been offering rewards, bribing cops.
son of a bitch is obsessed.
well, you've seen him. Still not hearing any brilliant solutions.
one step at a time. First I need to figure out a way in.
Oh, good luck.
Wes' organization is huge, but since the bust, it's family only.
there's always a way in. You just have to know your target.
are you sure you're sure, Mike? I mean, Rebecca...
she needs our help. Her brother didn't do anything wrong. We're doing this.
I don't know, Mike. You got three states' worth of gang members here.
I mean, you can't get them all busted.
maybe the old torch-and-pitchfork routine would work, huh?
you know, round up some villagers.
just brainstorming.
forget the whole gang. This comes down to Wes.
if we convince him it was someone else who got his father busted,
Rebecca's brother is off the hook. I just need an approach.
okay, well, check this out.
Wes' dad, Hank, died in prison six months ago of a heart attack.
but his old cellie -he's in a work-release program in Tallahassee.
he'd be a walking encyclopedia on Wes' dad.
we get some background info, I could approach Wes as Hank's prison buddy.
you're fine making the trip up to Tallahassee?
you'll have backup.
you haven't lived till you've spent a midsummer road trip with Nate Westen.
me and Nate versus the ex-con? Seriously?
time is tight. I need to stay here and make the approach as soon as we've got some info.
Hey, if you want, you can babysit Rebecca. I'll go with Nate.
no, no, no. Thank you. Bring on the ex-con.
unlike common criminals, spies are trained to work with their captors to negotiate their own release.
in most cases, it simply requires staying calm, relaxed, and being as helpful as possible.
of course, it's a lot more difficult when the person standing across from you is someone you hate.
I realize that working with us is more akin to a shotgun wedding than a romantic courtship, but you have done it before.
well, that was for Michael, not you.
I get it - you're not joining my fan club anytime soon.
it's sad, but I've come to terms with it. Listen to me carefully, please.
the deal that Michael Westen's been offered has a solid shot to get you out of here.
I'm just trying to help.
last time you helped me, you pulled Michael out of Ireland without so much as a goodbye.
I'll tell you what -why don't we go ahead and focus on the present, okay?
peruse that.
you want my help bringing down Greyson Miller.
putting him out of business would make certain middle eastern allies happy, which would make the Agency happy, which could make you very happy.
it's just a great big circle of bliss. Do you love it?
what does Michael say about all this?
I'll be honest with you. At first, he wasn't thrilled with this proposition, but he realizes that this deal is your ticket home.
and that's where he wants you - home.
fine. I'll do it.
I need to make arrangements to reach Greyson.
let's get into it, then.
I need you to call Michael's mother and tell her to bring the picture frame that I gave her last year.
a photo frame.
I don't want to know, do I?
got it.
next time we drive 500 miles to interrogate some dead guy's ex-cellmate, we're taking my car.
I mean, these seats are as hard as a park bench.
this is a high-performance machine, Nate, okay?
could your car have got us here in less than six hours?
I - I don't think so.
well, at least I wouldn't have to listen to five hours of Queen.
now you're gonna dog my playlist. - It's shrilly.
if by "shrilly," you mean "angelic," then I agree with you.
wait a minute. Look who's here.
here we go.
excuse me. Excuse me.
whatever you're selling, I don't want any.
you Butch McCall?
how you doing? Ben Wexler. This is my associate Sam Baum.
we're with the National Institute of Prisoner Psychology.
we're going around conducting interviews with former inmates.
we just need about - Not interested. Now, get lost.
now, Mr. McCall, you should know that anyone who participates in the study will receive
$500, sir.
$500. And that's in your pocket. Cash.
$500.
so now all you got to do is answer some questions about your old cellmate.
I believe his name is Hank Foster.
you have me confused with somebody who gives a damn! Now get lost.
okay, no, that's good. Okay, that's
someone just got their first lesson in cattle-prod safety -two hands, dude.
two hands. - Two hands.
how you feeling, butch? Still tingles a little bit, right?
who the hell are you people? - That's a good question.
um, I guess technically we are researchers, right?
we're just not from the National Institute of... whatever the hell I said. That was a lie.
we just have a few questions about your old cellmate.
anyone who been in the joint know you don't snitch about anything to anyone.
right, right. What happens in Union Correctional stays in Union Correctional.
look, man, we're not the cops.
we just want to know a little more about Hank, okay?
his likes, his dislikes, his habits, his thoughts on global warming.
Yeah, and what if I decide to tell you to kiss my ass? Then what?
just remember, you're protecting a dead guy.
I mean, is it really worth it?
you still offering the $500?
well, that depends on how helpful you're feeling.
he said the prison gangs left him alone after that.
so, Hank's cell was at this end.
he used to play backgammon with the, uh, dudes from his cellblock at these tables right here.
the laundry room was over here at this end.
that's where Hank had his heart attack.
great. Anything else?
um, nope. I think that pretty much brings Skype storytime to an end.
all right, you should pack up and get out of there as fast as you can.
will do.
Hey, Mike, he said Hank was one tough bastard, so I doubt his son's gonna be a pushover.
you sure you got enough info to sell your cover?
I'll make it work.
selling a cover as a former convict is about the little things
the habits you learn in prison, things like wearing shoes without laces, refusing to make direct eye contact, and asking permission before doing even the most basic task.
I'm sorry. I don't - I
I was hoping to speak with Mr. Foster, if that's okay.
I - I don't mean to intrude.
it's a little late for that.
the name's Freddie Kupfer.
I was in your dad's backgammon club, you know, upstate.
I was hoping that we could privately conversate.
we're already conversing privately.
you just haven't said anything yet.
fair enough. Your dad wanted me to give you a message when I got out.
it's about how he got pinched.
Oh, damn it, Wes. Don't let this guy ruin our meal.
what, you running some sort of scam, looking for a handout?
no scam, nope...
although Hank did say that you might be able to slide me some startup cash, like you did for your Uncle David when he got out.
was that supposed to be on the D. L? Sorry.
why don't you tell me what my dad said? And I'll decide what it's worth.
your dad said,"Wes needs to know he's chasing the wrong guy.
it wasn't Trent that dropped the dime."
when making an approach, solid intelligence is often just a starting point.
scam or not, it sure sounds like a fairy tale.
gauging the different reactions of your target and those around him can help you fill in the blanks.
while you may already know how a man feels about his dad...
Seriously? You're - you're kicking me out?
Hank said that you two were tight. Hank said that you were just like him.
keeping your eyes open can also tell you about how that man's wife really felt about her father-in-law.
I'll tell you another thing he said.
he said his champ would be all over this, though he didn't think the wife would let you off the leash.
basically just a phone book for all my contacts.
should I, uh, be running a metal detector over the throw pillow you gave me?
uh, no. No, that was just a pillow.
all right, then, this, uh, little toy will make it seem as though your call is coming from your very own cellphone, somewhere in South Miami.
my operative's in place. You just get Greyson to the meeting.
officially, Fiona Glenanne was never arrested, so Greyson should buy it.
Greyson will want to do this his way.
it would be a lot easier if you'd let me handle him in person.
the warden's not gonna be too eager for you to be having an afternoon stroll all by yourself.
we're gonna use my operative.
I brought you a cheat sheet so you can get all the details just right.
can I take my frame back now? - I wish you would.
Fiona, let's make that call. Speakerphone, please.
been a while. - I've been out of the country.
I need to put some cash together.
the last shipment that I bought from you -I need to sell it back.
all right. Five grand.
five? It's worth 10 times that.
okay. How does...Five grand sound?
you're a bastard. Did you know that?
well, sounds like you're in a bind. Take it or leave it.
fine.
my associate Steven Delprete will meet you.
don't know him. Won't work with him.
it's you or Michael, or no deal.
fine. Michael, then. - I'll text you the details.
sounds like a barrel of laughs.
would you like to tell Michael, or should I?
you need the number? - No, I have Michael's number right here.
look, I won't be able to stop the alarm from going off, so we'll have about a minute before this place turns into cop central.
this place is huge. There won't be enough time.
just keep moving. We'll be fine.
explosive breaching is usually the fastest way into any building, but it isn't exactly the most subtle.
when a softer touch is required, a compact hydraulic wedge can quickly pry a door away from its frame without waking up the neighbors or singeing off your eyebrows.
let's move. Clock's ticking.
precinct 234, right?
looks like it's organized by year.
08-52979-the song I've been singing for the last three years.
what are you doing? Just take the whole box.
I got to make sure the file's here.
well, hurry up! - Back off and keep watch, will you?
gotcha.
time's up. We got company.
back up. Back up. He'll see us.
I'll take care of it. No, no, no, no. No way.
you know why I only spent five years in jail?
it's 'cause I didn't point my gun at anybody.
I'm not gonna have him see my face.
don't fight it. Don't fight it. Relax.
see? He didn't see your face. Happy?
let's get the hell out of here.
Oh, that doesn't look promising at all.
well, what are we doing up here?
Oh, I thought you'd like the view.
you don't know anything about cops, do you?
they have to search the whole building before they come up here.
just calm down and let me think.
yeah? I think we're screwed.
you're the one who was taking your sweet time in there.
they're everywhere. I say we go back down and grab the guard that you took down.
at least we have a hostage that way. - And risk being spotted?
the only thing going for us right now is we haven't been seen yet.
Oh, that cat's gonna be out of the bag pretty quick.
fastest way back to the car is straight ahead.
all we got to do is get the cops to move.
I have a buddy who lives around here.
creating distractions is well, let's just say it's hey. Uh, Chuck?
Yeah, yeah, it's me. Listen, I'm gonna cut right to it.
I have a little bit of a problem.
Yeah, no kidding, Mike. What the hell's going on in there?
look, I'm at that cop-record place around the corner from you.
look, I set off these big air-raid sirens.
pigs haven't seen us yet. - How much time you got?
well, we're on the roof. I'd say maybe 10 minutes.
so, I need you to create a big distraction on the northwest corner, give the cops something else to think about.
Yeah, we're on it. Sit tight, buddy.
great. Now what are we gonna do?
I thought Mike knew what he was doing, huh? This is a disaster.
don't get ahead of yourself. It's only a pre-disaster.
now, look, Mike wants a distraction, right?
so, we'll set off an alarm in the impound yard.
the cops will think Mike escaped the building.
brilliant. So, we get chased by the cops instead.
I didn't say the plan was perfect.
what are you doing? What's that for?
it's one of those friendship bracelets.
what's it look like?! It's our way off the roof.
I thought you said you had a buddy - He's gonna give us an opening.
and when he does, we're gonna have to get down as quick as we can.
like gym class, all right?
not a good time.
Michael, I've been calling you. I need your help.
what's - what's going on?
it's this thing Card wants me to do.
Fi, he is trying to help you. - Yeah, I know.
the problem is, Greyson will only make the deal with you.
can you meet him this afternoon?
I'm kind of in a tough spot right now. Could we do it tomorrow?
no, he won't budge. It's now or never.
so quiet. Must be serious.
Yeah, I,uh - Michael, I understand. It's okay.
I'll get it done.
I know you'll try, but you can't be everywhere all the time.
I wish I was there to back you up.
that's enough. Look it, I hate to interrupt this lovefest.
we only have one shot here, so I need you to abandon whatever Reindeer Games you're currently involved in and get on this.
I'm going as fast as I can.
you got time to make phone calls now? Who the hell was that?
just a girl, on again, off again, jail again
long story that we don't have time for.
the mistake people make in trying to deal with a guard dog is trying to deal with a guard dog.
a well-trained German Shepherd can run nearly 30 miles an hour, jump about 5 feet vertically, and bite with more than 500 pounds of pressure.
all right. Ladies first. - You're such a gentleman.
yeah? Wait till you get the bill to repair my trunk liner.
trying to distract a dog may seem like a good idea, but it usually just delays getting attacked by a few seconds.
the best strategy is to stay as far away as possible and, if you can, put some solid steel between you and the animal.
get in there. That dog looks hungry.
all right, all right, all right.
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah, thanks for that.
what are you, a size 12?
11
still remember what you're doing there, grandpa?
trust me - best hands east of the Mississippi. Just give me one second.
m - maybe two.
there we go. Buckle up.
that's not gonna keep those cops back much longer.
don't worry. Here comes the cavalry.
and there they go. Run, little piggies!
you ready? - Ready.
walk in the park, right?
let's get the hell out of here.
I don't see any cops.
once we get out of Overtown, we're as free as a bird.
maybe we should ditch your ride, just in case.
we have a better chance getting caught car-hopping than we do motoring through.
what are you worried about?
in 15 minutes, you'll be home, enjoying some alone time with that file.
Yeah. Hey.
Michael, please tell me you're on your way.
working on a couple more kinks.
Ah, well, that doesn't sound very promising.
I must tell you, your extracurriculars are getting in the way of my operation.
I'm trying to.
remember what I told you in training about the verb "to try"?
how much time do I have?
an hour, max.
Michael, if you want us to close up shop here, you just say the word because I just don't think it's fair to Fiona to get her hopes up.
no, don't pull the plug. I'll
no more calls. Got it?
Yeah, I'm sorry. It's just my bookie. I'm in a big hole with him.
one more job, and I get back to even - Worry about this job first.
what are you worried about?
we're miles away from the cops. My buddy took care of us.
damn it.
if we don't lose them now, it's gonna get ugly real fast.
try the first side street after 23rd. Duck into the housing projects.
you sure it's not a dead end this time?
that wasn't my dead end. It was your wrong turn.
yelling isn't helping. - Then get us out of here.
Hey, you want to drive? Come on over.
they get much closer, I'm gonna have to start shooting.
all right. I got an idea, but you're not gonna like it.
Hey, Sam.
Hey, Jesse, uh, please tell me you're still at the loft.
I was just leaving. What's up?
Oh, great. Listen, uh, I got a bit of a cop problem.
you know the speedboat that's docked down by the river?
Yeah. - Yeah, I need you to get that and meet me under the Port bridge, you know, like now.
you got it, Sam.
did you say,"under the bridge"?
Yeah, hope you can swim.
more often than not, high-speed chases end with the fleeing driver in handcuffs or in a bed at the hospital.
escaping with your freedom and the ability to use both of your legs means making a getaway the cops aren't prepared to deal with.
okay, running out of real estate. You ready?
we die, it's on you, Evel Knievel.
well, we make it, mojitos are on you, sweetie.
okay!
did I come through with this, bro, or did I come through?
you're right. It says the cops had a different informant. It's not Trent.
I told you. Hey, I got to go.
you got a lot of things to work out, a lot of things to figure out.
Oh, there's nothing to figure out 'cause there's only one person that could have given the cops this much info.
but there's no way - can't be right.
if it's in the file, I don't know how you argue with that.
you don't understand.
everything in this file - it points to my wife.
when your target draws a conclusion you're not ready for, you play along if it helps you get the job done.
sometimes, it makes wrapping up a mission quick and easy.
no, I don't buy it.
and other times, it makes your job that much harder.
damn, this must be difficult for you.
but I think you got to start facing the facts.
Donna has been with me forever. She's my whole life.
why would she do this?
well, with your old man gone, maybe she wanted to move up the food chain.
Hey, you have to admit, the shoe fits pretty damn good.
now I know why she gave me such an icy reception.
this isn't possible. There has to be some kind of explanation.
you're starting to make excuses for her?
you sound like my mom when she got in a fight with my old man.
Oh, he didn't mean it. He loves us.
you gonna forget that your dad died in prison because of her?
you have to remember that, bro.
I have been saving this bullet for the person who sent my dad away
you want me to use this on my wife?
no, you're smarter than that. You kill her, you go to jail.
don't kill her. Just... kick her ass out.
don't look back.
I can't. - You have to.
you have to think about all the wasted hours you spent chasing the wrong guy!
you have to think about the pain she caused you.
you have to do this for you.
you have to do this for your dad.
you have to finish what you started, bro.
I'm gonna talk to her.
I'm gonna sort this out.
Ah, the outdoor speakers are busted again. I got to get
don't take another step.
we got to talk right now.
Wes, quit screwing around. What's - I'm serious.
what the hell's going on? - Explain something to me, Donna.
why do I have a file that says you've been feeding info to the cops?
why does it say that Trent was a damn goose chase? Explain that to me!
what? Hold on.
honey, where are you getting all of this?
from your new friend there?
what's it matter? - Okay, this is crazy.
think about it.
ever crossed your mind that this guy is playing you?
he could be working for Trent for all you know.
look at you, always spinning a story, trying to wiggle your way out of this.
okay, who the hell do you think you are?
Wes, how long have we been together?
I love you. I would never do this to you.
what, that son of a bitch comes in, and -and everything changes?
he's not even family.
family? You don't think watching his dad's back in the joint for three years makes me family?
breaking my parole?
baby...
look, Wes, this is your move.
you know what to do, and if you don't...
maybe you're not the man your dad thought you were.
get her out of here. I never want to see her here again.
what?
baby, come on! Baby, just - Wesley!
come on! Baby!
all this crap.
some detective I turned out to be.
you figured it out. You just needed a co-detective.
I got to jet.
anything you need, you just ask.
I might take you up on that.
here I, uh - I thought you forgot all about us.
Oh, I'm fine. Thanks.
where am I going for this meet with Greyson?
grove Key Marina, and don't bother stopping for a snack.
you only have 30 minutes to get the guns, and you still need to get wired up.
tell Fi I'm on my way.
news flash -turns out your boyfriend can be everywhere at once.
sadly, that means my evening is also spoken for.
I can't wait to meet this Greyson in person.
you boys have fun. - Oh, I'm sure it'll be a blast.
listen, I,um - I went ahead and took the liberty of getting you some takeout
Thai, I think, or - I-I can't remember, but whatever it is, I'm I'm sure it's a lot better than what you get in this dump.
you think a little lousy takeout is gonna make me forgive you?
Forgivee me?
forgive me for pulling every single string at the Agency to get you out of here?
or is this still about Ireland?
because if it is, let me straighten you out on that score.
Michael's cover was about to be blown.
he wouldn't leave you.
forget about the fact that, if he stayed, you'd both be dead right now, or worse.
and would you, uh
would you like to venture a guess just exactly who dropped everything and flew halfway around the world to make sure that that didn't happen?
so, for all the happy memories that you have made so far with Michael Westen, the fun, the excitement, the, uh - the felonies...
you... are... welcome.
I rush across town to make this deal, and Greyson doesn't bother to show up on time?
Hey, you know what? It sure beats waiting on pins and needles for you all day.
what can I say? I'm in high demand.
how about you focus on the prize there, maestro?
shot at the buzzer only counts if you drain it.
and Greyson is now headed your way.
remember, he has to take receipt of the guns before we move on him, yes?
you know, I was able to function in the field for six years without you.
no joke, Michael.
best years of my life there, pal.
almost didn't recognize you without the suit.
laundry day. Where's my five grand?
answer something for me first.
Oh, is this an interrogation or a deal?
that's the thing. I haven't heard from Fiona for months, and then, boom, deal of the century?
you know when something seems too good to be true.
come on, now, Michael. Fi's counting on you. Bring it home.
Oh, you think this is a setup? - Crossed my mind.
if I was working with the cops, they would have already stormed in here the moment you pulled a gun on me.
I don't hear any sirens.
fair point.
still, I'm curious why Fi's in such a hurry to offload these guns.
she's trying to buy me off.
what are you talking about?
she skipped town. She headed back to Ireland with this Brit.
screwed me on a deal.
what can I say? At least she pays her debts.
well, at least she gets you to pay her debts.
well, look at that.
michael Westen with a broken heart.
it kills me. It really does.
I'll be crying into my pillow tonight.
this should cheer you up a little.
guns are in the Charger. Load 'em up.
that's our cue. Drop the hammer. Go! Go! Go!
you son of a
you think Fi would replace me with a Brit?
you're dead, Westen. You hear me?!
dead, dead, dead, dead. Yeah, I know.
what do you say, Card? Greyson is in cuffs.
is that enough to make the Agency happy?
Michael, take a breath, for the love of God.
you are allowed to be human every once in a while.
answer the question, please.
well, Michael, as of 20 seconds ago, Fiona got invited to the CIA company picnic.
she is an official asset.
now it is up to you to apprehend her "Get out of jail free" card.
go get 'em, tiger. - I'm working on it.
Hey, Mikey.
I think you've earned a couple beers for working double-duty today.
Thanks. I'm not drinking.
well, neither is she.
I thought we were all supposed to be friends now.
doesn't matter. I guess I can toast by myself.
your brother is safe. - Are you sure?
you don't think Wes is still gonna come after him?
Wes found someone else to blame. It's over.
thank you.
um, I don't really know what else to say other than...
thank you. - Like I said, I always keep my promises.
well, I suppose you want me to hold up my end of the agreement now.
I've been supplying Anson with travel documents and cash every couple of weeks.
I can tell you the exact location of the hotel in Atlantic City where he's expecting his next drop.
but there's something I want from you first.
just promise me, when you finally get that bastard in custody, no deals, no negotiations, no compromises.
Anson will get what he deserves.
I promise you that.
my name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...Family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
...and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
that's how we do it, people.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
I'm gonna get you out. We got a lead.
if I get Anson, would that be enough to get Fiona out of jail?
it's a start.
I can be done with you right now.
maybe you should just go ahead and pull that trigger.
you can just add me to that list of bodies you've been dropping shut up. Shut up! I said shut up!
I work for Anson because if I don't, my brother dies.
Rebecca, listen to me. You hate Anson.
you hate him at least as much as we do. I saw it in your eyes.
help us take Anson down. We'll keep your brother safe.
sorry, Sam. It's too late.
I know what it's like to save someone close to you by selling your soul a piece at a time.
there's only one way to finish this for good.
we have to take him down together.
there's nothing you can do.
you're wrong. There's nothing I won't do.
in many ways, being a spy is just like any other job.
you get a paycheck, go to meetings, return phone calls.
and if your supervisor invites you to a fancy lunch without telling you why, it's either very good news or very bad.
you're 30 seconds late.
my training officer would have booted you out of the Agency for that.
tell you what - I'll make it up to you.
drinks are on me.
why don't you tell me why I'm here?
I forgot how much fun you are.
there is news on your whole "Get Fiona out of jail" project.
why do I get the feeling there's a "but" at the end of this?
there always is, isn't there?
the C. I.A. would like her to prove that she is a friend of the Agency before they're willing to talk terms of a deal.
a friend of the Agency.
relax, Michael. They just want her arms supplier.
that wasn't what we talked about, card.
well, the consensus was that your panties would be in a bunch over this.
that's why I'm here to see you personally.
that's why I'm buying you $18 drinks.
and that's why I can tell you this -I can still make this happen, but I need you and her to play ball, and I need you to help convince her.
do I have a choice?
not really
not if you ever want to see your girlfriend again without a pane of glass between the two of you.
well, I guess, then, I'm in.
Sam, there are chairs inside, you know, where it's not 100 degrees.
Yeah, I'm giving Rebecca some space.
I'm kind of terrified of that look in her eyes, when things aren't going her way.
still haven't found her brother?
Yeah, I'm all buddied out, Mike -I mean, FBI, NSA, Interpol.
the whereabouts of Mr. Trent Lang are a mystery to us all.
is she still keeping everything close to the vest?
Yeah. She won't say anything about where he disappeared from or what spooked him, so for all I know, the guy wandered into the wrong section of Bed Bath & Beyond.
all right, I'll go talk to her. - Yeah, good luck with that, brother.
Rebecca, we need to talk about your brother.
you can't find him, can you?
I seem to remember sparing your life so you could.
you haven't given us much to go on.
I already told Sam I'm not letting you gamble with my brother's life.
this thing with Trent is delicate.
and I'm telling you that I specialize in delicate situations.
try me.
fine.
let's just say there are some very dangerous people after Trent.
Anson found out where Trent is hiding, and he said that if I don't do his bidding, he'll tell these people where Trent is.
finding your brother might not be the only answer.
these very dangerous people might be a good start.
I'm asking you to trust me.
how can I do that?
how do I know you'll keep your promise?
until he met me,
Anson Fullerton was running an international conspiracy with hundreds of operatives and billions of dollars.
and then I swore to take him down.
now he's off hiding in some spider hole under an assumed name, and you're all he has left.
so, you go ask him if I keep my promises.
last time I saw my brother was in that club.
he liked to dance? He tended bar? I need a little more here.
Trent was hired to do payroll.
a few months in, he figured out it was just a front for a criminal syndicate.
he tipped off the cops and slipped town?
Yeah. The police busted the boss for racketeering.
that's Wes Foster. It was his dad who went to prison.
so, Wes took over the family business, and he's picked up a new hobby, which is hunting my brother.
he's been offering rewards, bribing cops.
son of a bitch is obsessed.
well, you've seen him. Still not hearing any brilliant solutions.
one step at a time. First I need to figure out a way in.
Oh, good luck.
Wes' organization is huge, but since the bust, it's family only.
there's always a way in. You just have to know your target.
are you sure you're sure, Mike? I mean, Rebecca
she needs our help. Her brother didn't do anything wrong. We're doing this.
I don't know, Mike. You got three states' worth of gang members here.
I mean, you can't get them all busted.
maybe the old torch-and-pitchfork routine would work, huh?
you know, round up some villagers.
just brainstorming.
forget the whole gang. This comes down to Wes.
if we convince him it was someone else who got his father busted,
Rebecca's brother is off the hook. I just need an approach.
okay, well, check this out.
Wes' dad, Hank, died in prison six months ago of a heart attack.
but his old cellie -he's in a work-release program in Tallahassee.
he'd be a walking encyclopedia on Wes' dad.
we get some background info, I could approach Wes as Hank's prison buddy.
you're fine making the trip up to Tallahassee?
you'll have backup.
you haven't lived till you've spent a midsummer road trip with Nate Westen.
me and Nate versus the ex-con? Seriously?
time is tight. I need to stay here and make the approach as soon as we've got some info.
Hey, if you want, you can babysit Rebecca. I'll go with Nate.
no, no, no. Thank you. Bring on the ex-con.
unlike common criminals, spies are trained to work with their captors to negotiate their own release.
in most cases, it simply requires staying calm, relaxed, and being as helpful as possible.
of course, it's a lot more difficult when the person standing across from you is someone you hate.
I realize that working with us is more akin to a shotgun wedding than a romantic courtship, but you have done it before.
well, that was for Michael, not you.
I get it - you're not joining my fan club anytime soon.
it's sad, but I've come to terms with it. Listen to me carefully, please.
the deal that Michael Westen's been offered has a solid shot to get you out of here.
I'm just trying to help.
last time you helped me, you pulled Michael out of Ireland without so much as a goodbye.
I'll tell you what -why don't we go ahead and focus on the present, okay?
peruse that.
you want my help bringing down Greyson Miller.
putting him out of business would make certain middle eastern allies happy, which would make the Agency happy, which could make you very happy.
it's just a great big circle of bliss. Do you love it?
what does Michael say about all this?
I'll be honest with you. At first, he wasn't thrilled with this proposition, but he realizes that this deal is your ticket home.
and that's where he wants you - home.
fine. I'll do it.
I need to make arrangements to reach Greyson.
let's get into it, then.
I need you to call Michael's mother and tell her to bring the picture frame that I gave her last year.
a photo frame.
I don't want to know, do I?
got it.
next time we drive 500 miles to interrogate some dead guy's ex-cellmate, we're taking my car.
I mean, these seats are as hard as a park bench.
this is a high-performance machine, Nate, okay?
could your car have got us here in less than six hours?
I - I don't think so.
well, at least I wouldn't have to listen to five hours of Queen.
now you're gonna dog my playlist. - It's shrilly.
if by "shrilly," you mean "angelic," then I agree with you.
wait a minute. Look who's here.
here we go.
excuse me. Excuse me.
whatever you're selling, I don't want any.
you Butch McCall?
how you doing? Ben Wexler. This is my associate Sam Baum.
we're with the National Institute of Prisoner Psychology.
we're going around conducting interviews with former inmates.
we just need about - Not interested. Now, get lost.
now, Mr. McCall, you should know that anyone who participates in the study will receive
$500, sir.
$500. And that's in your pocket. Cash.
500
so now all you got to do is answer some questions about your old cellmate.
I believe his name is Hank Foster.
you have me confused with somebody who gives a damn! Now get lost.
okay, no, that's good. Okay, that's
someone just got their first lesson in cattle-prod safety -two hands, dude.
two hands. - Two hands.
how you feeling, butch? Still tingles a little bit, right?
who the hell are you people? - That's a good question.
um, I guess technically we are researchers, right?
we're just not from the National Institute of... whatever the hell I said. That was a lie.
we just have a few questions about your old cellmate.
anyone who been in the joint know you don't snitch about anything to anyone.
right, right. What happens in Union Correctional stays in Union Correctional.
look, man, we're not the cops.
we just want to know a little more about Hank, okay
his likes, his dislikes, his habits, his thoughts on global warming.
Yeah, and what if I decide to tell you to kiss my ass? Then what?
just remember, you're protecting a dead guy.
I mean, is it really worth it?
you still offering the $500?
well, that depends on how helpful you're feeling.
he said the prison gangs left him alone after that.
so, Hank's cell was at this end.
he used to play backgammon with the, uh, dudes from his cellblock at these tables right here.
the laundry room was over here at this end.
that's where Hank had his heart attack.
great. Anything else?
um, nope. I think that pretty much brings Skype storytime to an end.
all right, you should pack up and get out of there as fast as you can.
will do.
Hey, Mike, he said Hank was one tough bastard, so I doubt his son's gonna be a pushover.
you sure you got enough info to sell your cover?
I'll make it work.
selling a cover as a former convict is about the little things
the habits you learn in prison, things like wearing shoes without laces, refusing to make direct eye contact, and asking permission before doing even the most basic task.
I'm sorry. I don't - I
I was hoping to speak with Mr. Foster, if that's okay.
I - I don't mean to intrude.
it's a little late for that.
the name's Freddie Kupfer.
I was in your dad's backgammon club, you know, upstate.
I was hoping that we could privately conversate.
we're already conversing privately.
you just haven't said anything yet.
fair enough. Your dad wanted me to give you a message when I got out.
it's about how he got pinched.
Oh, damn it, Wes. Don't let this guy ruin our meal.
what, you running some sort of scam, looking for a handout?
no scam, nope...
although Hank did say that you might be able to slide me some startup cash, like you did for your Uncle David when he got out.
was that supposed to be on the D. L? Sorry.
why don't you tell me what my dad said? And I'll decide what it's worth.
your dad said, "Wes needs to know he's chasing the wrong guy.
it wasn't Trent that dropped the dime.
when making an approach, solid intelligence is often just a starting point.
scam or not, it sure sounds like a fairy tale.
gauging the different reactions of your target and those around him can help you fill in the blanks.
while you may already know how a man feels about his dad...
Seriously? You're - you're kicking me out?
Hank said that you two were tight. Hank said that you were just like him.
keeping your eyes open can also tell you about how that man's wife really felt about her father-in-law.
I'll tell you another thing he said.
he said his champ would be all over this, though he didn't think the wife would let you off the leash.
come on.
Rob... hold on a second.
are you serious, Wes? Get rid of this loser.
let me handle it.
you should watch your mouth.
these were Hank's words, not mine. I apologize.
speak fast. - All right.
there was this ex-D. A.paper pusher, doing time with us.
some of the other guys would work him over pretty good.
he let slip that the cops had a secret informant on you, someone you didn't even know about.
that's all you got? Sorry. That's not enough.
wait. Wait. That's all I got? Who said that's all I got?
he also said there was a file, a file in some warehouse in Overtown, I think, that should tell you who the snitch is.
and how do I get to see this file?
you could ask nicely, but I could also offer my services as a procurement specialist.
a thief. - Yeah. I got it. Thanks.
fine. You got a job.
you earn your keep, it pays pretty good.
but if you're playing some game, I will bury your ass alive.
I'll tell you what - if I don't come through, I'll grab a shovel and help you dig.
okay, how many of these have I had, 'cause it sounded like you just promised Wes you're gonna bust into a police storage facility, and I know you're not brain-damaged.
I had to offer him something.
Wes needs proof, and he's not gonna believe me unless he has to work for it.
Anson kills my brother if this isn't done delicately.
getting arrested is not an option.
nobody's getting arrested.
I just need you two to plant a file for Wes and me to find, and I will handle this delicately.
okay, Mike, I can back-date some C. I.A. payment invoices and fudge some operation status reports.
who we setting up?
just say "unnamed informant" and point everything away from Trent.
let Wes spend the rest of his life tearing his team apart trying to figure out who betrayed him.
there you have it. Go, team.
Yeah, why don't you just promise him a walk on the moon while you're at it?
if that will prevent them from hunting your brother, it's on the table.
don't get him started. I don't have any buddies at NASA.
this place is amazing. Bro, wow.
I mean, it reminds me of that movie where the ex-con gets mistook for a rich guy and there's a cowboy hat and there's a monkey that
Oh, actually, I think that was a TV show. - I didn't see it.
it means you're doing good for yourself.
what can I say? My wife has good taste. Mm.
seriously, you couldn't have met up at the nightclub?
cut him some slack. He's a guest.
sorry. That - that just...
well, tell your "guest" not to touch anything else.
I have a friend who can fix this. He owns a machine shop.
don't worry about it. It's better if you stay out of her way for now.
come on.
I didn't put all this up overnight.
this is years of blood and sweat.
you saying this is all for nothing?
it's the cops. It's how they do it.
you're busy, uh, chasing this, uh, Trent guy while the real informant gets to breathe easy.
which would mean this is all lies.
not lies. You know how when we were in school, when you put your name on the smart kid's test?
I did. This stuff happened. It just wasn't Trent.
if my dad knew about this, why didn't he say anything?
well, why didn't he talk to our lawyers?
he was putting it all together, but then his heart stopped.
maybe he would have told you, but you didn't visit him the last few months he was on the inside.
tell me about this police warehouse.
I got a guy who works at city hall. He mops the floors.
now, when we were kids, he - he blew his pinky clean off.
we used to call him -this is not the point.
he was able to pull the blueprints and the work schedules.
now, if we enter the warehouse here, between swing shifts, we'll be able to grab the files and bolt -less than a minute.
and you're sure that file will be there.
I have never been sure-er.
budget constraints force most government offices to manage their files using rigid, out-of-date filing systems.
the constant glitches and lack of technical support give you a great opportunity to sidestep the normal rules and procedures.
how you doing there?
uh, this little devil didn't get back into the file box
case number 08-52979.
can you make sure it finds its way back home?
Thanks, man. - Appreciate it.
case is closed. Doesn't say anything about new files.
Ah, well, it'll be under Detective Finley.
should come up in a few hours.
or next June. You know how it is.
sorry. Can't file this without proper authorization.
of course, if you run into someone who insists on doing things by the book, you better know how to bend those same rules in your favor.
okay, listen, uh, we need your help here, see, - 'cause I'm a - An idiot.
an idiot who's gonna get us both suspended.
well, I need supervisor approvals.
Hey, eyes up here, little man.
he's already on my bad side.
and if you don't want to end up there, too, you'll quit looking down my shirt and take the damn file.
I... wasn't, ma'am.
you can't bend the rules for your precious file room, but sexual harassment's okay.
okay. Okay. Okay. I'll file it.
just go.
you know, you're, uh
if you say "pretty when you're angry," I'll break your jaw.
no, I was gonna go with "terrifying."
look who I found in the visitors center.
Hi.
honey, what happened?
it's fine. It's nothing. It's good to see you.
you too.
well, you'll be home soon, right?
that's what this is all about, isn't it -getting out of here?
and the quicker we get going, the faster she'll be eating some of your world-famous meat loaf.
would you back off?
I am just concerned with national security, Fiona's freedom, and getting a dangerous gun-runner off the street, but by all means, you take your time.
is he always like this? - Yeah. Did you bring it?
Yeah. I hope this is still what you're looking for.
um, I deleted some pictures of you and Michael on the beach.
Nate kept sending all these photos of the baby, and I needed to make some room. I'm sorry.
it's okay. There are no secret messages in my photos.
encrypted data card
basically just a phone book for all my contacts.
should I, uh, be running a metal detector over the throw pillow you gave me?
uh, no. No, that was just a pillow.
all right, then, this, uh, little toy will make it seem as though your call is coming from your very own cellphone, somewhere in South Miami.
my operative's in place. You just get Greyson to the meeting.
officially, Fiona Glenanne was never arrested, so Greyson should buy it.
Greyson will want to do this his way.
it would be a lot easier if you'd let me handle him in person.
the warden's not gonna be too eager for you to be having an afternoon stroll all by yourself.
we're gonna use my operative.
I brought you a cheat sheet so you can get all the details just right.
can I take my frame back now? - I wish you would.
Fiona, let's make that call. Speakerphone, please.
been a while. - I've been out of the country.
I need to put some cash together.
the last shipment that I bought from you -I need to sell it back.
all right. Five grand.
five? It's worth 10 times that.
okay. How does...Five grand sound?
you're a bastard. Did you know that?
well, sounds like you're in a bind. Take it or leave it.
fine.
my associate Steven Delprete will meet you.
don't know him. Won't work with him.
it's you or Michael, or no deal.
fine. Michael, then. - I'll text you the details.
sounds like a barrel of laughs.
would you like to tell Michael, or should I?
you need the number? - No, I have Michael's number right here.
look, I won't be able to stop the alarm from going off, so we'll have about a minute before this place turns into cop central.
this place is huge. There won't be enough time.
just keep moving. We'll be fine.
explosive breaching is usually the fastest way into any building, but it isn't exactly the most subtle.
when a softer touch is required, a compact hydraulic wedge can quickly pry a door away from its frame without waking up the neighbors or singeing off your eyebrows.
let's move. Clock's ticking.
precinct 234, right?
looks like it's organized by year.
08-52979-the song I've been singing for the last three years.
what are you doing? Just take the whole box.
I got to make sure the file's here.
well, hurry up! - Back off and keep watch, will you?
gotcha.
time's up. We got company.
back up. Back up. He'll see us.
I'll take care of it. No, no, no, no. No way.
you know why I only spent five years in jail?
it's 'cause I didn't point my gun at anybody.
I'm not gonna have him see my face.
don't fight it. Don't fight it. Relax.
see? He didn't see your face. Happy?
let's get the hell out of here.
Oh, that doesn't look promising at all.
well, what are we doing up here?
Oh, I thought you'd like the view.
you don't know anything about cops, do you?
they have to search the whole building before they come up here.
just calm down and let me think.
yeah? I think we're screwed.
you're the one who was taking your sweet time in there.
they're everywhere. I say we go back down and grab the guard that you took down.
at least we have a hostage that way. - And risk being spotted?
the only thing going for us right now is we haven't been seen yet.
Oh, that cat's gonna be out of the bag pretty quick.
fastest way back to the car is straight ahead.
all we got to do is get the cops to move.
I have a buddy who lives around here.
creating distractions is well, let's just say it's hey. Uh, Chuck?
Yeah, yeah, it's me. Listen, I'm gonna cut right to it.
I have a little bit of a problem.
Yeah, no kidding, Mike. What the hell's going on in there?
look, I'm at that cop-record place around the corner from you.
look, I set off these big air-raid sirens.
pigs haven't seen us yet. - How much time you got?
well, we're on the roof. I'd say maybe 10 minutes.
so, I need you to create a big distraction on the northwest corner, give the cops something else to think about.
Yeah, we're on it. Sit tight, buddy.
great. Now what are we gonna do?
I thought Mike knew what he was doing, huh? This is a disaster.
don't get ahead of yourself. It's only a pre-disaster.
now, look, Mike wants a distraction, right?
so, we'll set off an alarm in the impound yard.
the cops will think Mike escaped the building.
brilliant. So, we get chased by the cops instead.
I didn't say the plan was perfect.
what are you doing? What's that for?
it's one of those friendship bracelets.
what's it look like?! It's our way off the roof.
I thought you said you had a buddy - He's gonna give us an opening.
and when he does, we're gonna have to get down as quick as we can.
like gym class, all right?
not a good time.
Michael, I've been calling you. I need your help.
what's - what's going on?
it's this thing Card wants me to do.
Fi, he is trying to help you. - Yeah, I know.
the problem is, Greyson will only make the deal with you.
can you meet him this afternoon?
I'm kind of in a tough spot right now. Could we do it tomorrow?
no, he won't budge. It's now or never.
so quiet. Must be serious.
Yeah, I, uh - Michael, I understand. It's okay.
I'll get it done.
I know you'll try, but you can't be everywhere all the time.
I wish I was there to back you up.
that's enough. Look it, I hate to interrupt this lovefest.
we only have one shot here, so I need you to abandon whatever Reindeer Games you're currently involved in and get on this.
I'm going as fast as I can.
you got time to make phone calls now? Who the hell was that?
just a girl, on again, off again, jail again
long story that we don't have time for.
the mistake people make in trying to deal with a guard dog is trying to deal with a guard dog.
a well-trained German Shepherd can run nearly 30 miles an hour, jump about 5 feet vertically, and bite with more than 500 pounds of pressure.
all right. Ladies first. - You're such a gentleman.
yeah? Wait till you get the bill to repair my trunk liner.
trying to distract a dog may seem like a good idea, but it usually just delays getting attacked by a few seconds.
the best strategy is to stay as far away as possible and, if you can, put some solid steel between you and the animal.
get in there. That dog looks hungry.
all right, all right, all right.
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah, thanks for that.
what are you, a size 12?
11
still remember what you're doing there, grandpa?
trust me - best hands east of the Mississippi. Just give me one second.
m - maybe two.
there we go. Buckle up.
that's not gonna keep those cops back much longer.
don't worry. Here comes the cavalry.
and there they go. Run, little piggies!
you ready? - Ready.
walk in the park, right?
let's get the hell out of here.
I don't see any cops.
once we get out of Overtown, we're as free as a bird.
maybe we should ditch your ride, just in case.
we have a better chance getting caught car-hopping than we do motoring through.
what are you worried about?
in 15 minutes, you'll be home, enjoying some alone time with that file.
Yeah. Hey.
Michael, please tell me you're on your way.
working on a couple more kinks.
Ah, well, that doesn't sound very promising.
I must tell you, your extracurriculars are getting in the way of my operation.
I'm trying to.
remember what I told you in training about the verb "to try"?
how much time do I have?
an hour, max.
Michael, if you want us to close up shop here, you just say the word because I just don't think it's fair to Fiona to get her hopes up.
no, don't pull the plug. I'll
no more calls. Got it?
Yeah, I'm sorry. It's just my bookie. I'm in a big hole with him.
one more job, and I get back to even - Worry about this job first.
what are you worried about?
we're miles away from the cops. My buddy took care of us.
damn it.
if we don't lose them now, it's gonna get ugly real fast.
try the first side street after 23rd. Duck into the housing projects.
you sure it's not a dead end this time?
that wasn't my dead end. It was your wrong turn.
yelling isn't helping. - Then get us out of here.
Hey, you want to drive? Come on over.
they get much closer, I'm gonna have to start shooting.
all right. I got an idea, but you're not gonna like it.
Hey, Sam.
Hey, Jesse, uh, please tell me you're still at the loft.
I was just leaving. What's up?
Oh, great. Listen, uh, I got a bit of a cop problem.
you know the speedboat that's docked down by the river?
Yeah. - Yeah, I need you to get that and meet me under the Port bridge, you know, like now.
you got it, Sam.
did you say, "under the bridge"?
Yeah, hope you can swim.
more often than not, high-speed chases end with the fleeing driver in handcuffs or in a bed at the hospital.
escaping with your freedom and the ability to use both of your legs means making a getaway the cops aren't prepared to deal with.
okay, running out of real estate. You ready?
we die, it's on you, Evel Knievel.
well, we make it, mojitos are on you, sweetie.
okay!
did I come through with this, bro, or did I come through?
you're right. It says the cops had a different informant. It's not Trent.
I told you. Hey, I got to go.
you got a lot of things to work out, a lot of things to figure out.
Oh, there's nothing to figure out 'cause there's only one person that could have given the cops this much info.
but there's no way - can't be right.
if it's in the file, I don't know how you argue with that.
you don't understand.
everything in this file - it points to my wife.
when your target draws a conclusion you're not ready for, you play along if it helps you get the job done.
sometimes, it makes wrapping up a mission quick and easy.
no, I don't buy it.
and other times, it makes your job that much harder.
damn, this must be difficult for you.
but I think you got to start facing the facts.
Donna has been with me forever. She's my whole life.
why would she do this?
well, with your old man gone, maybe she wanted to move up the food chain.
Hey, you have to admit, the shoe fits pretty damn good.
now I know why she gave me such an icy reception.
this isn't possible. There has to be some kind of explanation.
you're starting to make excuses for her?
you sound like my mom when she got in a fight with my old man.
Oh, he didn't mean it. He loves us.
you gonna forget that your dad died in prison because of her?
you have to remember that, bro.
I have been saving this bullet for the person who sent my dad away
you want me to use this on my wife?
no, you're smarter than that. You kill her, you go to jail.
don't kill her. Just... kick her ass out.
don't look back.
I can't. - You have to.
you have to think about all the wasted hours you spent chasing the wrong guy!
you have to think about the pain she caused you.
you have to do this for you.
you have to do this for your dad.
you have to finish what you started, bro.
I'm gonna talk to her.
I'm gonna sort this out.
Ah, the outdoor speakers are busted again. I got to get
don't take another step.
we got to talk right now.
Wes, quit screwing around. What's - I'm serious.
what the hell's going on? - Explain something to me, Donna.
why do I have a file that says you've been feeding info to the cops?
why does it say that Trent was a damn goose chase? Explain that to me!
what? Hold on.
honey, where are you getting all of this?
from your new friend there?
what's it matter? - Okay, this is crazy.
think about it.
ever crossed your mind that this guy is playing you?
he could be working for Trent for all you know.
look at you, always spinning a story, trying to wiggle your way out of this.
okay, who the hell do you think you are?
Wes, how long have we been together?
I love you. I would never do this to you.
what, that son of a bitch comes in, and -and everything changes?
he's not even family.
family? You don't think watching his dad's back in the joint for three years makes me family?
breaking my parole?
baby...
look, Wes, this is your move.
you know what to do, and if you don't...
maybe you're not the man your dad thought you were.
get her out of here. I never want to see her here again.
what?
baby, come on! Baby, just - Wesley!
come on! Baby!
all this crap.
some detective I turned out to be.
you figured it out. You just needed a co-detective.
I got to jet.
anything you need, you just ask.
I might take you up on that.
here I, uh - I thought you forgot all about us.
Oh, I'm fine. Thanks.
where am I going for this meet with Greyson?
grove Key Marina, and don't bother stopping for a snack.
you only have 30 minutes to get the guns, and you still need to get wired up.
tell Fi I'm on my way.
news flash -turns out your boyfriend can be everywhere at once.
sadly, that means my evening is also spoken for.
I can't wait to meet this Greyson in person.
you boys have fun. - Oh, I'm sure it'll be a blast.
listen, I, um - I went ahead and took the liberty of getting you some takeout
Thai, I think, or - I-I can't remember, but whatever it is, I'm I'm sure it's a lot better than what you get in this dump.
you think a little lousy takeout is gonna make me forgive you?
Forgivee me?
forgive me for pulling every single string at the Agency to get you out of here?
or is this still about Ireland?
because if it is, let me straighten you out on that score.
Michael's cover was about to be blown.
he wouldn't leave you.
forget about the fact that, if he stayed, you'd both be dead right now, or worse.
and would you, uh
would you like to venture a guess just exactly who dropped everything and flew halfway around the world to make sure that that didn't happen?
so, for all the happy memories that you have made so far with Michael Westen, the fun, the excitement, the, uh - the felonies...
you... are... welcome.
I rush across town to make this deal, and Greyson doesn't bother to show up on time?
Hey, you know what? It sure beats waiting on pins and needles for you all day.
what can I say? I'm in high demand.
how about you focus on the prize there, maestro?
shot at the buzzer only counts if you drain it.
and Greyson is now headed your way.
remember, he has to take receipt of the guns before we move on him, yes?
you know, I was able to function in the field for six years without you.
no joke, Michael.
best years of my life there, pal.
almost didn't recognize you without the suit.
laundry day. Where's my five grand?
answer something for me first.
Oh, is this an interrogation or a deal?
that's the thing. I haven't heard from Fiona for months, and then, boom, deal of the century?
you know when something seems too good to be true.
come on, now, Michael. Fi's counting on you. Bring it home.
Oh, you think this is a setup? - Crossed my mind.
if I was working with the cops, they would have already stormed in here the moment you pulled a gun on me.
I don't hear any sirens.
fair point.
still, I'm curious why Fi's in such a hurry to offload these guns.
she's trying to buy me off.
what are you talking about?
she skipped town. She headed back to Ireland with this Brit.
screwed me on a deal.
what can I say? At least she pays her debts.
well, at least she gets you to pay her debts.
well, look at that.
michael Westen with a broken heart.
it kills me. It really does.
I'll be crying into my pillow tonight.
this should cheer you up a little.
guns are in the Charger. Load 'em up.
that's our cue. Drop the hammer. Go! Go! Go!
you son of a
you think Fi would replace me with a Brit?
you're dead, Westen. You hear me?!
dead, dead, dead, dead. Yeah, I know.
what do you say, Card? Greyson is in cuffs.
is that enough to make the Agency happy?
Michael, take a breath, for the love of God.
you are allowed to be human every once in a while.
answer the question, please.
well, Michael, as of 20 seconds ago, Fiona got invited to the CIA company picnic.
she is an official asset.
now it is up to you to apprehend her "Get out of jail free" card.
go get 'em, tiger. - I'm working on it.
Hey, Mikey.
I think you've earned a couple beers for working double-duty today.
Thanks. I'm not drinking.
well, neither is she.
I thought we were all supposed to be friends now.
doesn't matter. I guess I can toast by myself.
your brother is safe. - Are you sure?
you don't think Wes is still gonna come after him?
Wes found someone else to blame. It's over.
thank you.
um, I don't really know what else to say other than...
thank you. - Like I said, I always keep my promises.
well, I suppose you want me to hold up my end of the agreement now.
I've been supplying Anson with travel documents and cash every couple of weeks.
I can tell you the exact location of the hotel in Atlantic City where he's expecting his next drop.
but there's something I want from you first.
just promise me, when you finally get that bastard in custody, no deals, no negotiations, no compromises.
Anson will get what he deserves.
I promise you that.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing.
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate... - Someone needs your help, Michael.
...and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
that's how we do it, people.
bottom line
as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
put the weapon down.
hands on your head!
listen to me, Michael. Gray shot your brother. He murdered Nate.
Michael, what happened?
card's dead, Fi. Now we need a way out of here.
there's a full tactical support team on-site, and some heavy-hitter seems to be running the show.
Olivia
we got them boxed in. Whatever it takes, I want it finished.
we have Westen. Awaiting instructions.
stand down and let him go.
please confirm stand-down.
confirmed. All units stand down.
I'll never stop, Westen.
I'll hunt you down to the ends of the earth if I have to.
then I'll see you there.
when you're a fugitive, it's tempting to flee the country and worry about the details later.
but it's also a great way to get caught.
since most countries now require biometric I. D.s, the first step in getting out of town is getting good documents.
you can't just go somewhere new.
you need to be someone new when you get there.
Randy Weems? What the hell kind of name is that?
what happened to Chuck Finley? That's my lucky name.
well, I'm sorry, Mr. Weems, but my I. D. guy doesn't take requests.
Oh, crap. Well, just stick with "Sam," will you?
don't be calling me Randy until we leave.
speaking of leaving, shouldn't Elsa be here with the supplies already?
michael and Jesse are almost done with the radio.
don't worry. She'll be here.
I just gave her a few extra things to pick up for me.
she probably just got stuck shopping.
a few extra things? I thought we agreed...
listen, sister, if I'm gonna be living in a hut in the Dominican Republic,
I at least need a decent bottle of scotch.
I believe that's the sound of my scotch arriving.
Hey, beautiful. Thanks for coming.
I'm sorry it took so long. There was construction. It slowed everything down.
construction? Where?
at the entrance to the marina. What? Is -- is there a problem?
there's a reason fugitives are so paranoid.
when you're on the run, even the smallest change in your environment can put you on high alert.
but, then again, sometimes being paranoid pays off.
damn it! That's an earpiece!
see, this is bad. Those are agency guys. We're blown.
Yep, that's a gun.
my I. D. guy -- he was acting all jumpy.
kept asking if he could deliver the passports himself. I should have known.
they'll start searching as soon as they block the marina. We got to go now.
well, we aren't getting out of here by sea.
coast Guard is incoming.
Fi, get Mike and Jesse. - I'm on it.
Elsa, I got to ask you something that I don't want to ask you.
can we have your car?
of course. What -- what happens now?
once we bust out of here, that CIA team is gonna be all over you, so just...tell them that we stole your car.
and just tell them that... that you don't know me anymore, okay?
can you -- can you tell them that?
I'm sorry, Elsa, but it's just not safe.
I mean, they're gonna be all over us, so
I will try and figure something out, okay? I promise you.
coast Guard's almost on top of us, Sam.
Sam, we got to go. - Fine, Mike. Just start the car.
Bye, sweetheart.
stay beautiful.
I'm sorry, Sam. - I don't want to hear it, Mike. Just drive.
Mike, the window's closing up there!
I see it! I see it! Just hold on!
it's them!
Mike, you're not gonna make it!
hold your fire! Hold your fire!
they're gone.
looks like we're clear for now, but we can't stay here too long.
Sam. - Michael, give him a minute.
okay, so, those fake I. D.s... - Worthless.
wonderful. Got another I. D. guy?
none that I trust -- not now.
there's a passport office up in Boca. We could try to break in
Mike, come on. That's a crappy idea, and you know it.
Riley's gonna be expecting us to do exactly that.
now, I think I know a guy -- he's a friend of Dixon's, but... It's a long shot, so if anybody else has a better idea, let's hear it.
okay, then.
even if you evade the FBI, ATF, and DEA, a life of crime is tough to explain to the IRS.
that's why many career criminals have a day job.
it gives them a cover I. D.access to equipment, and a real W-2.
it also makes them easier to find if they won't answer your calls.
Hey, buddy. - Aw, Sam! What are you doing here?
good to see you, too, buddy.
this is my work! And I'm not your buddy.
Oh, come on, Dixon. After all we've been through?
didn't I get you a cargo plane last time I saw you?
Oh, yeah. That was easy to sell.
I just put it on Craigslist, and said "ignore the bullet holes.
just came because I need a little favor.
none of your favors are little.
okay, you know what? I'm done flirting. I'm not in the mood.
I got to get in touch with that guy you told me about, the smuggler -- Schmidt was his name.
the guy you said could move anything or anybody.
why do I tell you things? Why?
beause I think deep down, you like me.
no. No, that's not it.
okay, look, the point is, we got to get out of town with fresh I. D.s, okay
someplace warm, with decent beer. That's why we need Schmidt.
w-well, I'm sorry. Your timing sucks, okay?
schmidt's in hiding. He's in some sort of trouble.
no cell, no e-mail, no nothing.
you know, it's funny -- I bet the guy who builds his computer systems could find him.
say, wasn't that you, Dixon?
even if I could -- and I'm not saying that I can
there is zero chance that he'll talk to you.
all right, Dixon. Thanks a lot. - You're welcome.
really appreciate it. But, you know, before I go,
I thought I would just say I think it's great that a company like this would hire a convicted hacker!
should I go on?
how about the Navy, when they almost court-martialed you for stealing the skipper's porn collection?
should I go on? - No! Shut up! Shut up! Please!
take us to Schmidt, I won't say another word.
come on, Dixon. I'm in a hurry.
don't forget your Oreos.
counterintelligence, broadly speaking, is the practice of spying on someone who's spying on you.
with a little patience, you can learn a surprising amount about your enemies just by watching their own surveillance teams.
it starts with carefully observing who's at what location, when they're there, and how often.
once you have a list of possible candidates, you cross-reference with people from other surveillance sites.
if anybody shows up more than once, it's a safe bet it's not just a coincidence.
it's a lot easier to keep your secrets if you know who's after them.
got you.
why can't we just knock on the door?
you don't know Calvin Schmidt.
he's not gonna open the door for five people with guns.
it's okay.
so I have to be your pretend girlfriend?
come on. Here we go.
kiss for luck? Never mind.
what the hell are you doing here?
Hi, Calvin. It's really
was I -- was I unclear the last time we spoke?
I gave you a fat stack of cash, and I told you to forget my address.
Yes, I know. But look, look -- I want you to meet my girlfriend.
she needs your help.
she's desperate to get out of the country as fast as possible.
and since you're an expert in that kind of thing
you -- your girlfriend?
it's a new thing.
well, if she's your girlfriend, where did you meet?
both of you at the same time. One, two, three, go!
a f-friend's house. - I-- the Internet.
uh, my friend's Internet house. - I hope you get eye cancer, Dixon.
W-w-w-w-w-wait. You don't understand.
no, I-I understand well enough, okay?
and so spare me the sob story, spare me the desperate tale of woe.
well, I-I don't have a desperate tale of woe.
but I do have three very well-armed friends.
that would be us.
you might want to invite us in.
Dixon, you slack-jawed, traitorous nimrod! I
that's your spy friends!
I tell you I'm going off the grid, and you bring the most radioactive man in Miami to my door?!
are you gonna invite us in, or do I have to start shooting?
God. Fine. Yes. Come in.
quickly! Don't saunter! Do
you're sauntering on purpose. - Thank you.
No! You're not
you are repellent to me, Dixon, and are no longer welcome in my home.
wait! Wait, wait! But they drove!
good.
well, what do you want?
we need to get out of the country. We're told you're one of the best.
one of the best?
I could smuggle the Queen of England wearing the crown jewels as a bikini past border security, and nobody would bat an eye.
we need the whole package.
new identities in a foreign country and safe passage there.
can you do that?
normally, yes.
Yes, I smuggle people, I smuggle items, I smuggle goods.
anything smuggle-able, I smuggle, all right?
but seeing as you guys are these lights-out super-spies, maybe you've noticed the triple-locked door, the arsenal, the many empty food containers. Hmm?
did you maybe ask yourselves, do I look like I'm in a position to help anybody?!
okay. Why don't you just tell us why you're in hiding? Let's start there.
how about I don't? How about you leave?
all you need to know is there's a big scary guy who wants to grind me into dust.
mr Schmidt, there are at least a half a dozen things in here that I could use to blow you into little-bitty pieces, and I would use the dust to powder my nose.
look, we -- wow, we got off on a bad foot here, didn't we?
how about a drink, hey? Who wants a drink?
I'll take a little something. Can you do a mojito?
Yes. You know what? Actually, I have, uh, some fresh... mint.
Oh. Here you go.
flashbang grenades may not be deadly, but if one goes off nearby, it can cause temporary blindness and hearing loss.
the combination of those effects is enough to stun even the most hardened soldier.
but if you can take cover in time to protect your vision, you can still stay in the fight.
you may not be able to hear your enemy, but if you can see him well enough to pursue him, then it's just a matter of not letting the ringing in your ears distract you...
back off! Back off! - ...from taking him down.
let's try this again.
whatever problem you have, we will help you with, but we need to get out of the country, and you will help us.
do you understand? - Yes, I do.
you guys don't get it, alright. I-I-I'm, like, marked for death.
how stupid are you gonna feel if you come to me for help and I wind up dead?
just tell us about your situation.
okay.
a year ago, this Syrian woman comes to me
she's married to some jerk smacking her around, and, you know, I kind of have a thing against that.
Oh. Well, he's not a complete bastard.
I set her up with a new name, new life -- the whole deal.
turns out she's married to Jabbar Hamady, ex-Syrian intelligence services.
now he's a big gun runner and has a huge problem letting go.
and he came after you? - Yeah. He's got a fatwa against me.
w-when -- when he's not selling machine guns to toddlers in Sierra Leone, he's out looking for his ex-wife, so I went into hiding.
welcome to "hiding."
well, why don't you run your business from here?
he paid off some of my workers.
every time I try to move something, they show up with guns.
and if he were removed from the picture?
if you guys get rid of Jabbar Hamady,
I'll give you guys new identities, passports, a free trip to wherever you want to go.
okay. Just give us what you got on the guy.
one more thing, though
when we get the new names, mine is Chuck Finley. Okay?
that's non-negotiable.
you got it, Chuck.
Calvin - Taking a break? - Yes, as a matter of fact.
I figure if we're really gonna be on the run, this might be the last chance I have to get drunk in a jacuzzi, so...
I'm living it up while I can.
what do you think?
well, in addition to wife-beating, the guy's hobbies seem to be torture and war crimes.
which means if we can find Jabbar, we can let the authorities take care of it.
well, don't forget that we're on the run, too, so, you know, not like we're gonna run around Miami asking people if they've seen a pissed-off Syrian.
schmidt said he had one remaining warehouse, right?
what are you thinking?
if we could get Jabbar to send his men there,
I might be able to get to him.
Yeah, or you could just get shot.
Mike, come on -- too dangerous.
Sam, this whole thing with... losing Elsa, I just...
Yeah, well, doing something insanely dangerous won't fix what happened with me and Elsa.
I don't see another way.
all right, then. Let's go do something insanely dangerous.
this place is like a black market Costco in here.
Yeah, well, I'm kind of a big deal.
that's why I'm able to smuggle super-spies to other countries.
so, guys, what's the plan?
all right. Here's how it works.
every time you make a delivery from a warehouse,
Jabbar finds out, right?
yeah -- come looking for me, and then they steal everything.
okay, so, now you're gonna call in a pickup from this warehouse.
only this time, Jabbar's guys are gonna find a very unhappy ex-employee of yours here.
ex-employee? What
that's what Mike and Fi are setting up in your office.
Mike gets the guys to take him to Jabbar.
we carry the FBI on him -- problem solved.
Oh, problem solved.
you guys just skipped over the part where I lose everything I own!
shut up. Listen, Mike's doing the hard part here, okay?
all you have to do is make the call, wait for Jabbar's guys to show up, and run like hell.
I can't believe I'm even considering this.
I hate this plan. This is a horrible plan.
push the button. - I hate this idea! This is a stupid
looks like Schmidt doesn't much like our plan.
he'll come around. Let's get this over with.
well, just how tortured do you want to look?
think an angry Schmidt with a car battery.
electroshock torture is a messy business.
while most of the damage is internal, the electric arc that's created can burn anywhere from 2, 500 to 5, 000 degrees.
if you want to look like you've been tortured, but aren't willing to hook yourself up to a car battery, a curling iron can create similar burns without the risk of stopping your heart.
just a minute!
surveillance doesn't always have to be covert to be useful.
sometimes the best way into a target's life is through the front door.
good afternoon, Mrs. Westen. I'm Olivia Riley, CIA.
I'm in charge of the Agency's investigation of your son.
may I have a moment of your time?
of course. Please, come in.
there are advantages to being obvious when the goal is less about information-gathering and more about intimidation.
you, uh, really should have called first. I could have been out.
there's nothing more jarring than realizing that your every move is being watched.
I, uh, noticed that, uh, you stopped by your son's old place yesterday to take some photos.
our perimeter cameras spotted a silver Camry.
that was you, wasn't it?
it was.
I was taking pictures for the insurance company in case anybody needed anything.
interesting.
so you think Michael's going to come back and file an insurance claim?
I assume you realize your son's in an enormous amount of trouble.
he shot and killed a CIA officer.
if you're helping him in any way, that constitutes a federal crime.
I'm aware, and I'd like to help you, Ms. Riley.
anything I can do to get my son through this alive.
I, uh, wonder if, um, I could ask a favor of you.
I'd like you to sign this.
it affirms that you'll be cooperating fully with our investigation.
and if you violate this agreement in any way, you're looking at life in prison.
do you have a pen?
thank you.
there you go.
thank you. Well, that's all I need for today.
and, uh, please -- do call if you hear anything.
excuse me. Who are they?
Oh. Don't mind them.
they're just checking to see if your phone lines are working properly.
for your protection, of course.
of course.
we checked the inside of the house, as well.
just making sure there's no place for anyone to hide.
thanks for your time, Mrs. Westen.
no, no, thank you.
bitch.
how long is it gonna take for Jabbar's guys to get here?
I just -- I don't understand why I have to be here.
I mean, can't -- well, what if I wait outside?
I already explained this, okay?
Jabbar's guys need to think that they caught you by surprise while you were working Mike over.
Oh, okay, fine! Well, then why don't we wait closer to the exit?
because if it looks like we planned our escape, they'll know it was a setup, and Mike dies.
what if we die?! I mean, has anyone thought about that?!
Yes, which is why you need to stop talking!
just get ready,Because at any moment, they're gonna show.
they're in the warehouse! Schmidt, get out here!
they caught us by surprise! Can we leave now?!
dude, if we're gonna sell this, you got to put up a fight, okay?
which means you need to shoot at them.
shoot at them with your gun!
Yeah, I think they bought it.
there's too many of them! Let's get out of here!
go, go!
spies will use whatever they can to get behind enemy lines.
stealth, deception, and even capture.
a prisoner of war can learn about enemy morale, supply, and location.
of course, the first thing you have to do is convince your enemies you're worth more alive than dead.
don't shoot! Don't shoot! I'm unarmed.
Hey! Someone's here!
what is this? Who are you?!
my name is Brent Sodor. I used to be on Schmidt's security team.
you work for Schmidt?!
do I look like I'm still on the payroll?! I was being tortured!
please. You're trying to find him, right? Right? Am I right?
well, I can help you. I'll tell you anything you want. Just don't kill me.
please don't kill me.
untie him. We're taking him to Jabbar.
he lives for now.
most intelligence agencies lack the resources to set up safe houses all over the world, which is why they depend on expat civilians to lend their homes or businesses for missions abroad.
if you're a former Syrian intelligence officer, the local Syrian restaurant can make a handy base of operations
and save you a few bucks on lunch.
welcome, my friend. Please -- please sit.
you know who I am?
I have an idea. You're the guy that's... trying to kill Schmidt.
Yeah. My name is Jabbar Hamady.
Jabbar
Mr. Schmidt has taken something that belongs to me.
so, my men told me a very interesting story about finding you in the warehouse.
tell me about this.
Yeah, my name's Brent Sodor, and, like I told your men,
I'm on Schmidt's security team.
he thought I was one of the guys that was trying to sell him out to, uh... Well, to you.
he did all this to you?
yeah -- with jumper cables.
tell me something, Mr...Sodor.
I have my sources at Mr. Schmidt's operation.
how come I never heard of you until now?
he hired me on the qt, because he was always afraid of traitors.
and then you hacked the alarm system I set up in the Tampa warehouse, and then all of a sudden, I'm the traitor.
sugar?
one sugar.
just one?
two.
listen, Schmidt was a paycheck. I got no love for him. I just want to go home.
and I can help you.
how can you do that?
you want to catch this guy, right? I know where he lives.
you know where he lives. Nobody knows where he lives.
except me.
I'm telling you, I was his secret weapon.
in fact, the only place I ever met him was at his house.
if you want to hit him, you got to hurry.
I just wish
I just wish I could see that son of a bitch bleed.
okay. Give us his address. We'll go there.
hold on. Hold on.
how do I know once I give it to you, you won't just kill me?
why should I trust you?
Ohhh. Mr. Sodor, if you help me, I promise you, I'll repay the favor.
I'm a man of my word. But, uh...
I lack patience.
and suddenly, I'm overwhelmed with trust.
could you stop... loading your gun for a second? Stop loading. Just stop loading.
just want to make sure that I heard you correctly.
you're sending that psychopath here?!
Yeah, that's the whole idea.
Mike goes in, steers him to the house.
Jabbar comes here, attacks the place. We call the cops on him.
why am I hearing about this part of the plan just now?
the part where my last remaining possession gets chopped up by machine-gun fire and then turned into a crime scene?!
because we knew you'd get all whiny on us. - Whiny?!
listen -- the good news is, you don't have to part of the fireworks this time, okay?
fi is gonna take you up the road to a nice little motel.
you sit tight there. We'll come and get you when we're done.
it's Jesse. - Just-- just please try to be careful.
some of this stuff is really valuable.
yeah? Hope it's bulletproof.
come on, Schmidt. Open up.
come on, come on, come on.
bad news, Sam. When I was picking up rounds,
I paid a neighborhood kid to ride his bike by Maddy's house, just to make sure everything was okay.
he said the garden rake's propped up against the garage.
she gave the meeting signal? Why'd she give the meeting signal?
I don't know, Sam. It's a rake. It didn't come with subtitles.
if you think someone might be following you, the temptation is to drive erratically.
it may force the tail to reveal itself, but it also reveals you're onto them.
a better approach is to drive very conservatively.
go below the speed limit and linger at stop signs.
you won't win any fans on the road, but it'll help you lose your tail.
if they think you're simply an overcautious driver, it'll catch them off guard...
...when you suddenly take a risk.
Oh, thank -- thank God. I was afraid you wouldn't make it.
well, we, uh... we've been busy. We got the signal late.
Yeah. That's the problem with communicating by garden tools.
what's going on?
Olivia Riley paid me a visit. She knows.
she knows I'm helping you, she knows I'm following them.
she knows everything.
and she bugged my house. - Are you sure?
Absolutely. They were all over the place. And they weren't even that careful.
and she made very sure I was aware of it.
she probably wanted to goad you into making contact with us.
Yeah. They had someone follow me.
I almost killed myself unloading the son of a bitch.
so, Fi, what do I do?
I mean, she's getting closer, and I don't know how much more we can meet like this.
well, I'll talk to Michael.
but in the meantime, if you need to reach us, you leave the house and use this, okay?
it's a burner phone. It should be safe to use.
wait. One more thing.
a long time ago, Michael disappeared, and he never said goodbye.
promise me you won't do that.
I promise.
nothing here. Anything on your side?
Jabbar rolls pretty heavy. My guess is, when he comes, we're both gonna see him.
so, where do you think you're gonna go -- after this is all over?
I don't know. I have no idea. How about you?
I was thinking Antigua. Always wanted to go there.
Nope, nope. Nope, nope, nope. No. I dated a girl from there once.
what? So the whole country's off-limits?
the whole West Indies is off-limits.
well, who's this girl? - It's a long story.
if we ever make it out of the U. S. alive, I'll tell it to you.
all kinds of craziness.
good crazy? - No.
is that Mike? - No, it's Schmidt. Hey, Schmidt. What's up?
you have to help me! They're coming!
okay... Schmidt, hang on.
what -- what's the problem? Is somebody at the motel?
no, I'm not at the motel, okay? I mean, I was at the motel.
then I went back to my warehouse
wait a minute. What -- you went to the warehouse? Why?
because I didn't think anybody would be here!
I thought that Jabbar and his men would be trying -- trying to kill me!
look, I have millions invested in here!
I was just trying to salvage something!
I thought they were gone, and then a couple of guys came back.
how many? How many guys?
three? Five? I don't know! Just get down here!
that doesn't sound good, Sam. - I know.
when planning an escape, patience is key.
someone without training might jump at the first chance to strike, but that's exactly the wrong time, because that's when your enemy's most alert.
in fact, the best time to make your move is after you've let plenty of other opportunities go by.
the other advantage of patience is it gives you a chance to find out if the situation has changed.
what happened?
we were on our way to his house, and my -- my men called.
he snuck into his warehouse.
he was hiding in his office, crying like a woman.
we got the pig. Now you'll get to see him bleed.
I been waiting for so long.
it's been 10 months since you helped my whore of a wife run away from me.
10 months.
now I think... My waiting is done.
look, I-I don't -- I don't know where she is, okay? - That's a lie.
no, l-listen, okay? Listen.
I made her a passport, and then I lost the paperwork, Because that was part of the deal.
I don't -- I don't even remember the name that I gave her!
Oh, I think you'll remember.
today, you're gonna die, Mr. Schmidt.
only question is how much you're gonna suffer.
this knife isn't hot enough.
when an operation goes seriously wrong, you have to decide quickly whether to bail out or keep pushing and try to salvage what you can.
bailing out is less risky, but when it means leaving someone behind to die, sometimes you just have to grit your teeth and roll the dice.
Mr. Hamady, can I talk to you for a second?
a few hours ago, that bastard was gonna kill me, but your men saved my life. I owe you for that.
I think I can help you. - I don't need your help.
with all due respect, I think you do.
I was an interrogator for the Special Forces.
you're trying to find your wife? I can help you do that.
yeah? What can you do that this cannot?
trust me -- I know what I'm talking about.
you told him that he would die no matter what.
you start cutting him up, he'll tell you every lie until he bleeds to death.
so what do you propose?
you ever heard of suxamethonium chloride? It's a hypnotic sedative.
you pump Schmidt full of that, he'll give you everything that you want.
I used to work with a medic. He can get it for me.
I just need to call him. I'll find your wife within the hour.
bring him a phone.
I still say we should go look for them.
how? All we know is Mike's somewhere in Miami and Schmidt's either with him or dead.
we can't just sit here. They're out there somewhere.
hang on. Could be Mike.
is that you, brother? - Hey, Chuck, I need a favor.
I need some suxamethonium chloride for an interrogation I'm doing of my son-of-a-bitch boss.
uh, Mikey, that's not a truth serum. That's a poison.
did you want Schmidt to die?
exactly. I think it's the only way we get what we want here.
uh, Mike, if you're doing what I think you're doing, we're gonna need an ambulance.
Oh, you read my mind. How soon can you be here?
I'm at that Syrian restaurant on 12th and Bayshore.
how much time do we have? An hour?
sounds great.
I don't like the sound of that.
uh, they must be in a tight spot, because Mike's trying to get Schmidt out by faking his death.
but with this suxamethonium chloride, five, six minutes in, you're dead for real.
which is why we need an ambulance. Only problem is, we don't have an ambulance.
Fi, when's the last time you talked to your EMT friend?
the guy with the dimples?
it's been an hour! How much longer?
not much longer. Look, I need to get Schmidt into this freezer.
the drugs work better if he's cold.
come on. We got one shot at this. You want to do it right?
well? Do you want to do this or not?
get in!
what are you doing?!
listen to me. Listen to me. We don't have a lot of time.
I can get you out of this, but you have to do exactly as I say.
I'm going to inject you with a drug
I already don't like this.
when I do, you have to resist for a moment and then tell me where you hid Jabbar's ex.
No! No! Do you know what he'll do to her if her finds her?!
if we pull this off, the last thing he'll be worrying about is his ex-wife.
T-t-this -- this drug -- w-w-what does it do?
I don't think you want to know. - Hey, you know what?
I'm sick of being the last guy who knows what's going on!
now, what does the drug do?
it's going to paralyze your entire body and stop you from breathing.
I-I-I didn't need to know that. You know what? I need to un-know that!
your friend is here.
Chuck. Thanks for coming.
Yeah, well, I don't have a lot of time, so can we do this?
Hey, no, don't! Don't!
shut up. Do it.
okay, this is gonna sting a little at first, but after a few seconds, you're gonna be feeling much more cooperative.
no, stop it! - Help me hold him, please.
don't!
okay, I'm giving him a low dose, but he's gonna conk out any minute, so you guys are gonna have to act fast.
there we go.
all right.
let's take this again. Where's his ex-wife?
I-c-- I c-- I can't.
just relax.
that's it. Calm down.
where did you hide her?
Cy-- Cyprus.
she's in Nicosia...
under the name... Yasmine... Sadek.
there's your answer.
maybe. Maybe not.
come with me. Let's confirm this.
Schmidt, how you doing?
uh, not -- not -- n-not good. I'm -- I'm woozy.
c-can't -- can't feel my legs.
you look nervous.
nervous? No.
well, you should be nervous, because if he's lying
if I learn that he's wasting my time
Hey, guys! Come here! There's something wrong!
what? What's wrong? What's wrong with him?
I don't know. He must be having some kind of allergic reaction to the drug.
I ca-- I ca-- I can't... breathe.
he's dead.
you killed him. What if he was lying?!
he wasn't lying! He gave you the answer! Ask your guy!
Rashad!! What'd they say?
she's there. We're getting her exact location now.
good. Have my men dump him into the ocean.
uh, okay, whoa. Whoa. You can't just dump him. I'm involved now.
his body washes up on South Beach, there's gonna be an investigation, an autopsy.
it won't take long before those drugs are traced back to me.
what do I care? It's not my problem.
let me at least just take the body back to the hospital.
we'll dump it in the incinerator. Nobody will know.
but we got to move fast,Because security comes on at 4: 00.
you got the information you needed. Let us take care of this.
Mr. Hamady, you saved my life. It's the least I could do.
fine. Take him.
I'm done here.
how long has it been? - Four minutes.
four minutes? We're cutting it pretty close.
come on. Let's get out of here before Jabbar sees us.
Fi, we need to get the biggest armed response we can get at that place.
how big? - Very big.
Jabbar's guys are armed to the teeth and aren't gonna go down without a fight.
I think I have an idea. Remember that burner phone we gave your mom?
Hello? - Mom, I don't have a lot of time.
I need you to say, in a loud, clear voice, "1212 Bayshore Avenue. Yes, Michael, I can be there.
are you sure? I don't know if anybody's told you
I know Riley bugged the house. It's what I'm counting on.
I need to get the CIA to show up someplace fast. Can you do that for me?
Yes, Michael. 1212 Bayshore Avenue. I can be there.
Thanks, Mom. I'll be in touch when I can.
we lost his pulse, Sam! - What?
I can't find a pulse!
there's nothing, man. Nothing. Nothing. - Do it! Do it!
how you doing back there, Sam?
not good, Mike. We think he was out too long.
okay, clear. - Yeah.
come on, buddy. Come on, buddy! Clear.
come on, Schmidt! - Come on, man! Wake up! Wake up!!
there we go! There we go!
he's back, Mike! We got it!
J-j-Jabbar -- Jabbar, is he
don't you worry about him. We're wrapping his sorry ass up right now.
was I -- was I dead?!
you really want to know?
no. No, I'm good. I'm good.
but... just a little -- You were dead. - yeah, you were a little dead.
counterintelligence usually starts as a subtle game of cat and mouse.
your adversary pretends not to be watching you, and you pretend not to notice, but the longer it goes on, the more inevitable it becomes that you'll end up in open warfare.
afternoon, Mrs. Westen.
Oh. I didn't see you.
you know, an interesting thing happened to me yesterday.
I found a Syrian spy at a restaurant in downtown Miami.
Wow. That must be some catch, huh?
actually, it was more like a consolation prize.
I had heard somewhere that your son might be there.
Really?
well... guess you can't believe everything you hear.
let's stop pretending, shall we?
next time you see your son
and we both know there will be a next time
you tell him I'm coming for him.
and if you keep helping him, I'm coming for you, too.
so... How soon can we leave?
well, that depends.
Schmidt, if you can't do this
I can do it, all right? Of course I can do it.
but the terms of the arrangement may have changed.
no. The deal was we get rid of Jabbar in exchange for an all-expenses-paid trip to wherever we want to go.
your words. - Yeah. Yeah.
that was before I knew that your plan involved Jabbar stealing everything I have left.
so you guys may have to foot some of the bill.
how much?
depends on where you want to go. Depends on how many of you want to go.
I mean, I-I-I-it's you two, uh, it's black George Clooney,
right -- the four of us.
Michael, you might want to double-check your head count.
everything all right?
you know, Mike, uh...
the last time I kissed my lady, she was crying.
I left her to be interrogated by the CIA so we could escape.
I'm sorry.
we're getting the passports. We need to know if you're coming.
Yeah, well, I got to think about that, Mike.
I'll let you know.
my name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate... - Someone needs your help, Michael.
...and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
that's how we do it.
bottom line
as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
put the weapon down.
hands on your head!
listen to me, Michael. Gray shot your brother. He murdered Nate.
I'll hunt you down to the ends of the earth if I have to.
then I'll see you there.
there she is.
Bye, sweetheart.
stay beautiful.
I'm sorry, Sam. - Yeah.
I don't want to hear about it, Mike. Let's just go.
so, all this is yours?
Yeah. I'm kind of a big deal.
Calvin
that's how I'm able to smuggle freeloading super-spies to other countries.
they're in the warehouse! Schmidt, get out here!
I'll give you guys new identities, passports, a free trip to wherever you want to go.
but you guys may have to foot some of the bill.
we're getting the passports. We need to know if you're coming.
because of you, Mike, the last time I kissed My Lady, she was crying.
I'll let you know.
one of the toughest tasks in intelligence work is learning how to wait.
when meeting an operative in public, you have to be on constant alert for undercover law enforcement and surveillance.
but when anyone could be your enemy, it's hard to act natural.
is that book any good? I've been meaning to read it.
there are no spies in it. That's a plus.
I used to bring you and Nate here when you were little.
he loved the swings. You couldn't pay him to get off of them. Remember?
my arms still hurt from pushing him.
eyes forward, Mom.
remember, just two strangers chatting in the park.
it's all right. Nobody followed me here.
I bought a day at the spa, I sneaked out the back, and just drove side streets all the way.
I'm clean. They're stepping up the surveillance, Michael.
you've got to leave Miami.
that's why I wanted to talk. I need you to find Barry.
you want me to reach out to a mon-- a money launderer?
have you heard nothing I've said?
Riley's watching me all the time.
please, Mom. Meet him in the ladies' room of your lawyer's office if you have to, but I need him to transfer money from our bank accounts to these countries.
Moldova... Nauru? Is that where you're going?
no, but the accounts are flagged by the CIA and everyone they work with.
if we do the transfers, they'll be searching for us everywhere except where we're headed.
is this goodbye?
it's close. If you need me
draw a green "X" on the bus bench in Miami Beach -- I got it.
I know physical contact isn't part of our cover...
but you're the only family I have left.
if they catch us, they catch us.
thank you, Mom, for everything.
have a nice time at the spa?
what are you people doing here?
just wanted to make sure your day was as relaxing as you'd hoped it would be.
you scheduled five hours' worth of treatments, I understand.
you were at the spa that whole time?
of course I was.
your men were following me -- just ask them.
I did, and they told me the same thing.
well, there you go.
but I believe in checking things out for myself, so I did some digging.
that's from southwest 27th Street.
and that's you behind the wheel.
it's about five blocks from the spa.
it was taken an hour into your appointment.
I'd like to show you something else.
it's the agreement you signed to be truthful and forthcoming with the agency, under penalty of perjury.
so, what happens now?
now? I'm done playing games. Cuff her.
an interrogation typically begins with deprivation and discomfort.
that means the thermostat cranked all the way up, uncomfortable furniture, dim lights that strain the eyes, and if there's food, not much of it.
it's all about making sure you're exhausted and vulnerable before your interrogator even sets foot in the door.
my goodness. Someone forgot to turn the air conditioner on in here.
I'm sorry I've kept you waiting.
I needed that.
do you know what the bit for an obstruction of justice charge is?
at your age, you'll die in prison.
beats ending up in a nursing home.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
you're helping an enemy of the state.
you're not gonna get sent to some medium-security playground.
you'll do hard time the whole time.
but tell us where your son is, it doesn't have to be that way.
the last I checked, the CIA is not allowed to spy on an American citizen, so I don't think I'd be the only one in trouble here.
you let me out now, or I'll call my lawyer.
if you think I would ever let you know where my son's gonna go, you're out of your goddamn mind.
going to go?
so, he's still in town?
thanks for all your help, Mrs. Westen. Someone will be by to see you out.
Hey, I'm not trying to get a fake I. D. so I can buy zymase.
no, you don't gouge Calvin Schmidt. You
are you laughing? Don't laugh at me! Are you kidding?
Hey, yourself.
where is everybody?
fi and Jesse are doing a perimeter check, and Schmidt's making our travel arrangements.
I'm -- I'm actually trying to
I'm helping you by calling you a douche bag!
Yes, I am! Yes, I am.
at least, he's trying to.
I didn't think you'd be back.
well, I wasn't sure myself. So, I went to see Elsa.
don't give me any crap about breaking protocol.
no, Sam, I'm glad that you did.
you should be 'cause she's the one who convinced me to stick by you.
she said if I abandoned my best friend, then I'm not the guy she fell in love with.
I don't know what to say. Thanks.
don't thank me 'cause I told her we're not just running.
as soon as we get someplace safe, we're gonna sit down and figure out a way to fix all of this.
so, please, Mike, don't make me a liar.
I promise you I'll make this right.
I don't know how, but... I will make this right, Sam.
Oh, no. No, no. We have a deal, Mr. Generous.
and I hope that you die in your sleep tonight!
that didn't sound good.
getting you guys out of the country is gonna be...
more expensive than we originally planned.
how much? - $200, 000 a head.
for fake I. D.s?!
not for fake I. D.s -- for fake identities, okay?
and I'm talking work visas, credit histories, and tax returns going all the way back to the Clinton administration.
that's fantastic. It really is, except for the part where it's gonna cost 800 grand.
cause there's no way in hell we can swing that.
fine, then I suggest you build a raft and start paddling to Cuba...
stop. Stop, stop. - ...Because I have got nothing.
unless I throw the world's most amazing bake sale in the next two
Schmidt, stop talking!
you still have pricy merchandise sitting in your warehouse, right?
Yes, in the warehouse! Problem solved.
Oh, wait a minute
you guys turned it into a gigantic crime scene.
there's cops all over the place. You can't even get close.
let us worry about that.
what's the most expensive thing that we can carry out?
well, all right.
assuming by some miracle you get by the cops, okay, there is a compartment where I keep certain items that I don't want my stickier-fingered employees walking away with.
tell us what we're looking for.
you're looking for a black case about yea big.
I have a client who, upon delivery, will pay $1 million.
what's in the case?
call it "sensitive electronics."
call your client. Tell him to expect it tomorrow.
Mike, I mean, every cop in south of the Mason-Dixon's looking for you, so you're not making a cameo at a crime scene.
and, honestly, I shouldn't either.
half the force knows this chin.
I'll talk to Jesse and Fi.
they're gonna walk into a suicide situation just because you ask them to?
Yeah, that's pretty much how we roll.
so, look, Schmidty, make sure you wear something comfortable tomorrow 'cause you're gonna help them get it.
well, I'm no expert, but I'm guessing a sealed door, plus three donut-eating cops, equals a... go-home situation?
Schmidt. - Let's go tell Michael we tried.
Schmidt, can you hush for, like, two seconds, please?
Fi, check it out. North wall -- 20 feet up.
thank you, Miami CSI, for being out to lunch.
I'm thinking we drive around back, come up the alley on foot.
climb the truck, squirrel through the window.
wow, sorry, you -- you just said "squirrel"?
do I look like a guy who "squirrels"?
do you really want us to answer that?
no, I don't. I was being rhetorical, handsome.
large security forces can work to your advantage because each individual thinks everybody else is paying attention.
so, if you find a hole in the security, you can get in.
of course, if anything goes wrong, you're surrounded by the same security forces you snuck past.
dude, it's like two feet. Come on.
okay, you gonna catch me? - Yeah, I'll catch you.
here we go.
okay. Great teamwork. Thank you.
Shh! Just keep your voice down. Now, where the hell is this case?
Oh. Follow me. And... I don't need the tone, okay?
okay, okay, okay. Hold up.
uh, go six... tiles, four west, two... north.
shouldn't you have a parrot on your shoulder?
Oh. Hilarious.
okay. Look out.
have at it. I don't do manual labor.
Oh, I would never have guessed.
and this thing's worth a fortune why, exactly?
cause that is what someone is willing to pay for it.
Ah, and it's heavy as hell. - Lift with your knees.
Aah, I think I just slipped a disc.
Hola, senoritas! I missed you.
what the hell are you doing?
what -- What the hell was that?
you think somebody heard that? - Yes, they heard.
no, no, no, no, no, no. I -- I can't go to prison. I will not do well in prison.
look, no one's going to prison.
we are gonna bust our way out of here.
go through the wall like the kool-aid guy? What are you, nuts?!
get in.
Aah! Oh, God! Oh, God!
okay, drive.
watch the gates.
all right, go! Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go!
Jesse, you're driving.
drive, bald man, drive!
okay. Okay.
is -- is anyone else at 300 over 140?
cause I -- I'm feeling my heartbeat in my retinas.
everybody okay? - Yeah,'cause God has a sense of humor.
we should be shot! We should be dead!
simmer down. You're gonna blow a gasket.
Oh, don't bother. He's been like this the whole way here.
um... guys?
looks like the mystery box... took a few bullets.
actually, it took a lot of bullets.
well, good job, super friends. It's destroyed. It's destroyed.
you got to be kidding me.
Mike, this is bad. This thing was our ticket out.
Sam and Jesse are picking up some new wheels in case we have to run.
so, I'm just gonna go ahead and ask -- what the hell is that thing?
it was a remote circuit cutter. It's for disabling alarm systems.
how does it work? - How it did work -- it was
okay, look. See
see this? It's a collimator. There's three of these.
they fire gamma rays, same as they use in brain surgery.
and you aim these at an alarm circuit and the point where the beams cross...
kills all the electronics.
what am I gonna do? My -- my client expects delivery on this!
you're still gonna deliver it.
no, I'm not, as it is broken.
and unless one of you has a degree in quantum physics, there's no way to fix it.
we don't have to fix it.
we just need to make it look good enough for the hand-off.
call your client, buy as much time as you can.
no, my -- my client robs and kills people for a living.
so, we don't have to feel bad about ripping him off.
just for the record, I think this is a terrible idea, and I think that you are not in a rational head space.
Hey! Yep. It's me.
um... Okay. Well, listen, I-I -- I-I hit some delays.
uh... I can have this thing for you next Tuesday, easily.
okay. Oh, okay.
all right. Okay, bye.
he says if he doesn't have this by 4: 00 today, he will shoot me in the throat.
well, that doesn't give us much time to fake this thing.
well, then, we better get started.
as a spy, you deal with a lot of dangerous people and a lot of dangerous technology.
since it's a bad idea to put them together, you get pretty good at faking sophisticated hardware.
the good news is that the more high-end the technology, the less likely your buyer is to know how it works.
hand them a device that looks right, feels right, and sounds right, and it should do the trick.
and adding a listening device is never a bad idea.
Oh, one more thing -- for luck.
Fi, we already have ears on the meeting.
the last thing we want is a gun in Schmidt's hands.
well, what if something happens and we don't get there in time?
Fi, we have a plan.
don't take this personally, but our plans haven't been going so well lately.
when you have a full-time surveillance team on your tail, it's difficult to set private meetings.
so, if you need to arrange a sit-down with someone you can't contact directly, you have to contact them indirectly.
Barry Burkowski -- I have an appointment.
Burkowski -- no, I don't see you.
what are you talking about? I got a call from a nurse that said I needed to come down right away for some tests.
some tests regarding a, um...
aggressive fungus -- in a very sensitive area.
I'm sorry. We don't have an appointment for a Barry Burkowski.
Really? Well, that's too bad for you because I'm not going anywhere until I see a doctor and they tell me that I'm parasite-free.
so, you work it out.
Barry. Funny running into you.
Mrs. Westen. What are the odds of
it was you. You set this appointment.
well, the good news is you don't have a fungus.
the bad news is...
michael needs your help.
you mean your fugitive son,"he who must not be named"?
Yes, him.
wait a minute, aren't you supposed to have, like, a team of 24/7 federal babysitters?
actually, I do.
in fact, they were nice enough to drop me off.
okay, hold on a second. I think my brain just exploded. What if they see us talking?
don't worry. They're waiting for me in a coffee shop down the street.
now, unless you want me to introduce them to you personally,
I would suggest that you hear me out.
Yeah, but, uh...
let's just do this somewhere a little more private.
perfect.
um... Okay. Let me get this straight now.
Mike wants me to throw up a financial smoke screen for every agency in the known universe?
well, you usually hide money to avoid the authorities, so now just... do the opposite.
"do the opposite." There could be some serious blowback here.
you know, that never stopped Michael from helping you.
how many times has he saved your ass? Three, four times?
I have saved his, too.
all right, well, I've helped save.
fine, look, I'm gonna do it.
good -- 'cause it needs to be done today.
all right. Now...
I need you to bring the account numbers to this address.
this is my loft in the design district.
be careful. Make sure you're not followed.
all right, thanks, Barry.
Oh, and, Mrs. Westen, one thing
the next time that you set up a meeting with somebody in a doctor's office, just go with something easy like... gluten allergy.
cause the fungus down under... ...freaked me out.
good to know. Thanks.
I can't do this, all right?
Yes, you can. See? The gizmo looks as good as new. This'll be a cakewalk.
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
you don't have to stare into the abyss of Thorne's eyes and try to rip him off.
take a breath.
good, now describe how a meeting usually goes.
so, I show up. Uh... I say hi.
sometimes he says hi -- not usually.
and then I give him the merchandise. He gives me the cash.
and you go your separate ways.
Yes. B-but what if he asks me to demonstrate how this works?
has he ever asked that before? - No, but he
then don't explain anything.
just give him the case, take the money, walk away.
like it's any other deal.
but this not any other deal, is it?
b-because in any other deal, I'm not selling him a broken box for $1 million.
W-where's the gun in this? Fiona said she put a gun in here. How does it come out?
hold on. There's a gun underneath that panel, but don't even think about going for it.
cause the chances of you blowing off your big toe are much better than hitting Thorne.
now, we got to go. Schmidt, when in doubt, keep your mouth shut.
okay.
I assume the Mike in this is working and you guys can all hear me.
uh, if I die today, my ghost will haunt your children's children.
it'll be like one of those Japanese movie ghosts, too
like the little girl floating. Really creepy.
Michael, are you sure he's gonna be able to sell this?
seriously, Mike, dude looks like a hot mess.
he'll sell it. He has no choice.
get ready -- I think our buyer's here.
Thorne. You look well... armed.
what can I say? I always come prepared.
I missed you, little buddy.
if I didn't know better, I'd swear you were ducking me.
why would I duck my favorite client?
the client Thorne Schmidt doesn't like
where the hell you been?
Oh, you know, doing my thing.
there was a whole backup with my warehouse
Yeah, whatever. I didn't ask you for your life story. Are we gonna do this, or what?
Yes. Uh, I believe this is yours.
okay.
my, oh, my. She is a thing of beauty.
Yeah.
Hey. What the hell's up with this?
what... the hell's... up with what?
the specs I gave you said that the housing was supposed to be platinum.
wait, what?
in almost any operation, there's a moment when everything hangs in the balance, when a dribble of sweat, a clumsy answer, or even a stutter could get you killed.
why didn't I use platinum? Yes. Because, look, this is tungsten.
okay, th-this keeps the gamma rays from leaking better than platinum.
Tungsten's all the rage now.
is that so? - Yes, that's so.
damn it, walk away. I told him to walk away.
take the money and walk away, Schmidt.
in fact, my tech said so, who, by the way, completely upgraded the calibration and guidance systems free of charge.
and, y-you know, that's why you come to me.
I go the extra mile
you showed this to a tech? What tech?
he's cool! He's cool, okay? He's a Professor.
he does this kind of stuff all the time. It's not a big deal.
it's a huge deal because it's not what I asked for!
sorry.
Schmidty, if this has a bunch of changes,
I don't know if I'm still gonna be able to use it.
that's why he said he is coming here to walk you through the whole thing.
he's on his way right now.
did he just say his tech is on his way? What the hell is he talking about?
we got to go in.
no, no. Hold off. Hold off.
if they're waiting on a tech, let's just give them one.
everybody watches my back.
no, Sam, you're not going in there. You don't know how it works.
no, Schmidt gave me the whole spiel on how it works. I'll be fine.
I'm not putting you in that position, Sam.
well, you're not -- I am. I got this.
good luck. - Thanks, brother.
I don't see this tech.
he's coming. He's coming.
when, Christmas? I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
I say we take him out to the Everglades and find us an alligator.
grab him. - Okay, listen -- wait! He
afternoon, gentlemen. - Oh, there he is. Hey. Hey!
Hey, guy. Glad you made it. - Yeah, so am I.
Hey, geniuses, thanks for setting up a meeting in the middle of rush hour.
settle down. What's your name?
Dr. Charles Finley. Schmidt said you wanted to review my work.
most of the upgrades, frankly, are gonna go...
way over your head, but the operation is the same.
guidance and calibration have been revamped.
most importantly, though, the collimator velocity -- that's the story of the day.
okay, save it, Einstein.
we were planning a little dry run with the cutter anyway. You're coming with.
Oh, well, that's not possible.
see, I'm just here to show you how this works.
I've got important research to get back
your beakers will be there when you get back, Doc. Let's go.
this is crazy. Just listen to me.
you want to test the cutter? That's fine.
we'll book some time at my lab. We'll do it the right way.
we can do it your way when you make the rules.
today's my day. Get in the truck.
well, we need to know where we're going first.
never mind that -- you'll find out.
no, no! Not "never mind. " Not even close.
look, if I'm breaking into some nuclear facility, I've got to know.
okay.
the place is called Pharmatech.
it's in Fort Lauderdale. They're closed on the weekends.
as long as the toy works on the back door, you'll be fine.
in case you forgot, this thing doesn't work.
they're going to kill us .
just stay calm, okay? My friends are listening in -- they'll help us out.
so, what now?
we get to Pharmatech and set something up before they get there.
that's off A1A -- it's got to be 45 minutes away.
I'll have us there in 30.
banking security algorithms look for anything unusual
transfers in large amounts, on the same day, or to multiple countries at the same time.
do any one of those, and you might get red-flagged.
do all of them, and you'll send the authorities looking for you anywhere you want them to.
one more transfer to the bank in Moldova, and we're done.
CIA and Interpol
they're gonna be chasing their tails hunting for Mike like a
yo. What?
whoa, come again? Where are they now?
okay. Thanks for the tip. - What was that?
my little bird at the Miami P. D. just informed me that there's a federal raid scheduled for here in 10 minutes.
I thought you told me these transfers couldn't be traced back to you!
they can't! They must have followed you.
no way in hell, Barry!
did you phone anyone? Anyone at all?!
no... one important.
no, I had to cancel a tanning session and an O2 session -- that's it.
you're a known associate of Michael Westen's.
all of these cancellations is probably what tipped them off.
Yeah, well, you know, sue me for not wanting to screw over my manscapist.
you know, hanging out with your family is like having a venereal disease
it's the gift that just keeps on giving.
you're right. It's my fault.
I should probably never have brought you here.
look, technically, it's Mike's fault, okay?
but we can do this blame game later.
there is a fire escape off the east porch, so go.
aren't you coming? - No!
these hard drives are not gonna slag themselves.
Plus, I've got my ledger, my files
I'm not leaving you behind!
Yes, you are, Mrs. Westen. Now go.
seriously, there's no point in both of us getting caught!
get out of here! Go! Scram!
I-I'm sorry, Barry.
tell Mike he owes me -- again!
hello. - Mrs. Westen, in the last 10 minutes
I've received calls from Scotland Yard, Interpol, and some jackass in the Moldovan army.
they're all deploying assault teams based on new leads on your son's whereabouts.
the thing is, each lead is in a different corner of the globe.
sounds like you've got a lot of important, pissed-off people on your hands.
why are you calling me?
because you put Burkowski up to this.
Really? What makes you say that?
I found three cigarette butts in his ash tray.
they happen to be your favorite brand.
and once the DNA work comes back, I'll have proof that you were involved.
you've crossed the Rubicon, Mrs. Westen, and now I
looks like we beat them here.
okay. Thorne said they're gonna be doing the test on the back door.
how do you want to play it?
if they're following the speed limits, we've got about 10 minutes before they get here.
