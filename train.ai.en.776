...for just one milligram more.
it's okay. I'm cool.
take this down,...and log a time and date because we might get out of here.
Sam Profit is going down! And he's going down so hard he's going to create another gravity well in this sector.
just let me at 'im. Just let me at 'im.
six feet, I can jump six feet. - Beka! What...?
flash!
I don't drink, did you know that?
I don't drink. I don't squirt, I don't snort, I don't inhale, I don't...!
I've been straight-edged all my life, all my life...
...because I'm my daddy's little girl, and I don't want to be like my daddy.
here I am, I'm streaking like a fleakin' comet.
you can't stop me.
you can't stop a Valentine with a head full of steam, believe me I know. I tried.
blood of my blood, Trance.
what if it's in my blood? What if I can't stop?!
okay, Beka please, just...try and slow down, all right?
inhale and exhale. Inhale, exhale...
don't TREAT ME LIKE A CHILD! I AM NOT A CHILD! YOU ARE!
or are you? How old are you, Trance?
I don't even know. I don't anything about you.
where you from?
who you're working for?
Why're you purple?
you workin' for Sid?
are you workin' for Sid? You're workin' for him, aren't you?
aren't you, Trance? Trance! Are you? Trance?!
Beka, stop it! Please Beka stop it!
no , no, I could do purple.
okay Beka, you're angry, and it's totally fine to be angry, but please be angry at him!
I know...I know...I know...I know.
trance. Trance, we have to get out of here.
I know where it is.
all right, come away. It's okay.
where is he?
I'm sorry, Captain Hunt has stepped away from his desk.
please leave a message after the tone from the funny little guy. Beep!
are you amused?
we have at best eight hours before that storm reduces us to component parts, and Dylan has disappeared.
I don't know. Ask Rev Bem, maybe he knows.
he's missing ,too!
try decaf.
back to normal? N'okay?
I will be.
robbed of my superpowers, I will have to rely on mere human ingenuity.
Oh, how are we going to get out of here?
let me think. Ummm...how about.this one?
Yeee-yeah!
sorry sweetie, the room don't come with a view.
Ohhh, I've been waitin' for this.
it's personalized to my own DNA...moron.
let's get them comm gear and let's get them out of here.
did I mention I'm not having fun yet?
nor I. Ship! I'm assuming command.
engage thrusters and take us out of here.
permission to come aboard, Captain Anasazi.
how often do you get the chance to get up close and personal with a class-seven solar storm?
it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, don't you agree?
you can't keep me here, I'm a highly respected businessman.
not on my ship, you're not. - You must understand,...
...I have to get back to the warehouse. My employees will steal me blind!
Oh, I do understand.
I understand that honesty and integrity were casualties of war,...
...and while I may not approve... for the record,...
I don't approve...right now, my bad day is your bad day.
enjoy the view.
welcome to our humble abode. - Keep that cannibal away from me!
uh, cannibal? No.
see, he doesn't eat his own kind. Chichin, however...
when their whining exceeds a certain... decibel level,...
...I find it very difficult to control my lower nature.
how much longer before the storm reaches its peak?
I wouldn't crack open any epic novels if I were you.
we might be able to hold together.
course, we'd be a lot safer if we had a working neutrino damper.
a damper?
you need a neutrino damper? What a coincidence,...
...I can get you a damper, a beautiful brand-new damper you will be proud to call your own.
you don't say...
this way.
I'm busy, Mick! - I know.
we've got a problem.
the blonde...tased me and the purple girl disabled the security grid.
they barricaded themselves in the room.
scuse me gentlemen.
listen to me, I want you to do exactly as I tell you...
trance, when did we leave the Andromeda?
how long've we been away? - I'd say this makes...five days,...
...but sometimes I lose count when I'm unconscious.
I was afraid of that. I told Dylan I'd be back by now.
probably thinks I ditched him. - Beka, I can hear them!
they're outside. Hurry up! - I just need one...more...minute.
I don't think we have another minute.
give it up girls, there's no way outta here.
wrong again. - Right! What?
hold your breath.
that was easy.
boss? Worked just like you said.
I'm wondering......if she's coming back.
what makes you say that?
well, you've spent the last three months helping her upgrade her ship.
you've armed it, you've rebuilt its engines and computers.
I think it's possible she may have taken advantage of your generosity and gone back for her own business.
because that's what you would do.
not after warning you.
so is this the point where he starts shooting at us?
well, I'm betting he won't kill us until he finds that data.
which we have?
okay, here's what I remember: "My dad and Sid were partners.
they built the Maru together.
they were always planning and scheming about getting rich.
until this one deal.
this was going to be the big score, the best deal ever.
and then, I don't know, it fizzled somehow.
dad and I went to Signa Gamma One to meet Sid,...
...and as soon as we got there, we just turned right around and...left.
no money, no cargo, no Sid.
as far as I know, that's the last time they saw each other.
autopilot engaged.
I'm betting whatever Sid's looking for has something to do with that trip.
well, he would've found the Eureka Maru's log by now, wouldn't he?
Yeah, if it was in the logs. - What are you doing?
remember when I told you that my dad made nanobots for my hair?
he did it as soon as we left Sig Gamma One.
Sid didn't even notice.
he hid his secret in your hair?
my dad may have been an addict, but he knew his nano-tech.
if I'm right, these little robots did a heck of a lot more than change my hair colour.
they recorded Sid's missing data on a molecular level.
zeros and ones, all adding up to this.
Signa Gamma One docking station.
Sid. Sid, are you there?
daddy.
they're dead.
they're all dead.
Ohhh Sid...
you think they'd just wave through a ten-ton shipment of flash?
Sid, what have you done??
I did what I had to do, as always.
you talk like a man... whose hands are clean.
I'm a thief. I'm a smuggler. I am not a murderer!
well you are now.
you're watching it, aren't you?
Sid. What did you do?
are you really never saw it? You really didn't? Heh.
paranoia. Kinda gets to you when you're in my line of work.
when you're a murderer?
Oh, it wasn't supposed to happen that way, Rebecca. Honestly.
somebody must've tipped off Signa customs.
you know the punishment for drug-smuggling on Signa Gamma One?
they chop you up for spare parts.
I had to protect myself, protect us both.
and then your father, he had the gall to blackmail me.
with the recording. - He was so pathetic.
he never asked for much, just a few guilders here and there,...
...a spare part or two, but there was always that recording hanging over my head.
and then,...
...then he fried himself on flash and I figured it was all over.
until I decided to buy my way into Trans-Galactic.
you were worried that I'd start using the tape against you.
I have always had a soft-spot for you, Rebecca.
and I figured that we could come to an arrangement.
that's when I sent you that message. But you never responded.
and then three years later, you show up on my doorstep?
what was I supposed to think? - You thought I'd ruin your deal.
you know, a ruined deal is one thing,...
...but to lose one's life... Sentiment only goes so far.
my feeling is, when it comes to destroying evidence,...
...nothing beats a sun. - Sun?
disengage autopilot!
authorization denied.
I helped build the Maru, remember?
little help here!
I'm sorry Rebecca, but I've had my fill of Valentines.
Incoming...
it's not gonna do you any good, you know. You're too late.
you think that was the only hair on my head?
back in the suite, I beamed the log to the Freelance Courier Co-op.
by now it's on its way to every law-enforcement agency in the quadrant:
open immediately upon my death." - You're bluffing.
you couldn't afford the courier fees. - I know, but you can.
unlimited credit, remember?
if anything happens to me, and I mean anything, you are front page news in three galaxies.
not bad kiddo. Not bad at all.
runs in the family. - All right, here's the deal:
I let you live, and you sit on that recording, and nobody ever sees it, because if it ever sees the light of day, I have nothing to lose.
your secret's safe.
as long as I'm alive. So you'd better wish me a long and healthy life.
why wouldn't I? After all, what are uncles for?
it's responding!
good! Get us outta here. - Okay.
Dylan, she is thirty-six hours late.
and I simply don't see why you should keep a bargain when she doesn't.
an incoming communication for you Dylan.
put it through.
this is the Eureka Maru, requesting permission to land, Captain Hunt sir.
affirmative, Eureka Maru. You're late.
Yeah, I know. - We know.
glad to have you back.
you know, whenever I think about my father, I picture him at the end. I try not to, but I still do. It was hard.
I have to just remember that those were just a few years in a long life.
when I was a kid, when he was young, he was the best, Trance.
he was smart, and funny, and tough. And brave.
he could make me laugh until my sides hurt.
no matter how dark things got, and no matter how long the odds, he always... always came up with a plan.
the right plan.
I wish you could've met him Trance.
Yeah, me too.
but you know, that's okay because... I know his daughter.
blood of his blood, Beka.
blood of his blood.
wealth is too Precious to be entrusted to the Rich.
anonymous Kalderan Proverb, circa [CY 500]
captain on deck!
I'll alert the media. - It means we're supposed to stand at pretension.
at ease Trance. I think it's a little late in the game to restore the military protocols.
I'm sorry, Dylan. Some of my systems have reverted to defaults.
excuse me.
after the number of scrapes she's been through, it's a wonder she's a-workin' at all.
don't worry, Rommie.
as soon as we dock at El Dorado Drift, we'll pick up parts and you'll be as good as new.
what he said. El D. She's got everything we need. Wine, wiring, and WOMEN.
all I care about is news, weather and sports. And that should be comin' in right about...now.
Yes! Civilization. - Mail call!
it's already here, courtesy of your friendly neighborhood space traveller's aid.
but...I don't know why you're so excited, it's always just bills for Beka,...or epistles from Rev Bem's spiritual pen pals. All you and I ever get is junk.
I know, and it is so great! Because you can buy your own moon......or you can make millions without ever leaving the comfort of your own homeworld!
...collection of CEO Sam Profit. - Oh here's breaking news,...
...Trans-Galactic is..."merging" with Quantum. Economists were taken by surprise.
get out of here! I own shares in Quantum.
you do? How many? - Three
well, don't count your dividends before they hatch. The Free Trade Alliance still has to give its approval.
please, the Free Trade Alliance never met a monopoly it didn't like.
I only have one question. What are we talking about?
analyzing.
Trans-Galactic Shipping and Quantum Express are two of the largest private cargo carriers in the sector.
their consolidation would...
would force small operators out of business by red-lining business and undercutting costs.
how is a little guy supposed to compete against someone like Sam Profit?
Trans-Galactic's "uber" big kahuna.
put him in a fish tank with piranhas... pray for the piranhas.
I'm sure that's all very interesting, but may we discuss the weather?
I didn't know you liked the weather.
I could tell you everything you ever wanted to know about cumulus clouds.
they form really high in the atmos...phere.
the only time the weather concerns me is when it threatens my health and well-being.
today, for instance.
a class-seven solar storm.
it's headed right for us. Looks like we better make those repairs quick.
I know. I know! More work for me.
Heya, boss? You know a guy named Sid Barry?
Yeah, he was my father's business partner. Why?
you got a message from him, marked...Extremely Urgent.
bring it up.
hello Rebecca. It's Sid, your Uncle Sid.
I hate to come to like this, but I need to see you.
there's an attached file with contact information.
I'm not going to beg you, Rebecca, but we both know your dad owes me one.
I guess I'm calling in my marker on the... the Valentine family huh?
I hope to see you soon.
sounds like he's in trouble.
I...hope it's not too serious. That message is over three years old.
the long night has come.
the Systems Commonwealth, the greatest civilization in history, has fallen.
but now, one ship, one crew, have vowed to drive back the night and rekindle the light of civilization.
on the starship Andromeda, hope lives again.
three years, Beka. You don't even know if he's still on Diphta Five.
I know, I know. - And the odds...
and the odds of finding him at all are like really really small.
you know, if you don't want me to go, why don't you just say so?
I don't want you to go.
damn. I didn't think you'd just say so.
we haven't got much time before the storm hits, and we need the Maru to carry supplies.
one of Andromeda's pods can handle it.
our pods aren't designed for moving cargo.
okay, they are, but...
...you speak Drift, and it's been a long time since I've bought anything.
blood of my blood, Dylan. That's what my father used to call me.
all my life, he never asked me for one thing.
now he's gone. And if I can pay back a debt for him,...
...I don't see how I have a choice.
solar storm hits in five days. Can you be back by then?
I better be.
can't trust you to fly us out of class seven storm.
we'll be here. Good luck.
autopilot engaged.
let me guess. Dylan asked you to keep an eye on me.
well, actually, Dylan wanted to send Rev Bem, but changed his mind 'cause of the strom.
...so nobody left, and I didn't want him to worry, I decided to sneak on board and here I am now.
are you mad at me? - Hm?
how can I be mad, Trance? I don't even know what you're talking about.
Oh.
don't worry, I'll look after her. Love, Trance.
so? - So now I'm worried.
they're both big girls. They can take care of themselves.
besides, we have plenty to worry about right here.
I say we prioritize the picotransducers, nanothrusters, and...an AP solenoid valve.
we can agree on the thrusters and the valve,...
...but we also need photon bombs, and we need to refit our pulse plasma guns and point defense lasers.
isn't this a lot of wishful thinking? How are we going to pay for all of this?
technically that would be the quartermaster's job.
we don't have a quartermaster.
are you saying we don't have any money?
Oh we have plenty of currency, it's just that none of it's...current.
okay, I can get most of this stuff, but we'll have to rig for a fast getaway.
Harper! - Harper, we're not going to steal anything.
thank you.
well, what would you suggest?
there's an old Earth custom, Tyr. It's called...a garage sale.
what's a garage?
Yuck! I hate planets. How could anyone live like this?
well, didn't your people evolve on a planet?
Yeah, the smart ones left, as soon as they got a chance.
brain dead flash fryers.
is that fun? - What fun?
squirting drugs into your eyeballs, because it seems like human beings enjoy poisoning themselves.
well, it's not really that simple Trance. Flash is a synaptic enhancer.
it makes you stronger, better, faster.
dad always said it made a great solution if you don't make it your...problem.
okay, so this is Avenida Nuevo Ciudad. This is supposed to be the place.
Ninety-four...ninety-two...ninety. Right there!
but...I think we're too late.
Sid's address but no Sid.
Ohhh great.
the light fixtures in the crew cabins can go.
sports equipment...stays.
we need weapons, not toys.
we need a crew that hasn't gone crazy from lack of recreation.
Oh, anyone who...touches my basketball hoop answers to me personally.
Oh oh, the drift trader that you're meeting is called Grask. Now he's a...Chichin.
Oh great. - Yes, they never buy what they can steal.
they're scum. They eat their own young.
I'll thank you to see that he comes nowhere near me.
Mmm...probably a good idea.
Yeah, make a note of that.
that's ceremonial china from the Than ambassador. - Really?
sounds like a spool of superconductor wire to me!
if I don't keep my eyes open, he'll probably sell the...
Rommie. Rommie. Would I...hurt you?
Hey, whoa!
where you goin' with all this good stuff?
that stays.
What'd I do?
personal effects of the crew.
Hey, I'm looking for a guy.
lucky you, you just found one.
a specific guy.
his name's Sid Barry. You ever seen him?
I not your type?
you know what they say, once you try bio-engineered, you never go back.
I think she's into older men.
what about you, sweetness, are you into older men?
or are you just into her?
watch the tail. - You know, grape's my favorite flavor.
Beka, are they cannibals?
C'mon baby, give me some sugar.
what the hell is that? - Sugar cane.
trance, your left! Other left!
you want him? The guy in the picture.
I know where you can find him.
Ohhh wow, this is amazing! That's real wood.
look at you, with your blond hair! I hardly recognized you.
what are you doing here?
I got an old message. I thought you needed help.
Oh.oh that.well...
...that's kind of complicated. - Mister Profit, line three.
profit? You work for Sam Profit?
Heh. Well, not exactly, I...
...I am Sam Profit.
this is it.
is this your room?
not at all my dear, it's your room. And yours too.
fit for a princess. Her daddy's little princess.
I still don't get it. How can you be Sam Profit?
you really had no idea?
the word shocked comes to mind. Amazed. Dumfounded.
so why'd you come all this way?
she came here to help you. - I came here to help Sid Barry.
remember him? - I'm still Sid.
not from where I'm standing.
when I was a kid,...
...you and my dad would stand around and complain about the big shipping companies.
now you're the one buying up the trade routes and forcing out people like us.
curse the big companies all you want, but big companies get things done.
and small operators don't?
you know, why don't I...walk around.
okay, this is me leaving.
it's all about moving things, kiddo. People, cargo.
the more things move, the more they connect, and the more they connect, the safer the universe gets.
and the richer you get.
money is not a disease. It's the cure.
let me ask you something: What was your father after his whole life?
redheads.
the big score. - Exactly!
and this is it!
he may not have admitted it, but this is what he was after.
this is what he wanted. What we wanted.
but you know what, enough about me.
is there anything you want?
chocolate!
I don't know. This is not what I was expecting.
hold that thought.
mister Profit, time for your Quantum run.
well, Quantum waits for no man. I've got to get back to the office.
by the way, you look a little tense. I hear Rutger has great hands.
Oh yeah?
what's so great about them?
trance... do not let him buy you off with a back rub.
this is Sam Profit we're dealing with.
I think you're just...cranky from the gravity.
why don't you just think of this as a way to... decreasing his corporate resources.
now, let's start with the tail.
is this receptacle hemititer or lixx?
I...think it's black plastic.
Oh. Too bad. It might have had value.
This...microsensor might have had value too if you... hadn't removed the fuel cell.
removed? No, not removed! Never removed.
Leeshka! My apprentice. Has the brains of a snivlet.
I should know better than to let him prepare a shipment.
Ah! Well, in that case let's have a look at the parts you packed yourself.
Yes!
this is so great! This is even better than the Andromeda.
and you know what, I think that this orange juice is real.
I bet they had to import it all the way from Rigel.
infinity, actually.
Wow! You look great.
Thanks.
you know I left some bubbles in the tub I should probably use them.
cute kid.
kinks all worked out? - Yeah. Not bad.
look I...I'm sorry I haven't had much time. Things have been really insane.
truth be told, you couldn't have come at a worse time. Speaking of which, why are you here?
I mean, not... not that I'm not happy to see you.
I told you why I'm here. I thought you were in trouble.
Oh yes! Well, I guess I've grown cynical in my old age.
it's just... the timing of your arrival is... is so surprising.
tell me about Ignatius. I...I'm really sorry that I missed his funeral.
you didn't miss much. "Eject cargo pod: Yes/No.
he deserved better.
you know my biggest regret? That he didn't live long enough to...share this with me.
he would've liked that. - Yeah.
he didn't...talk about me at the end, did he?
he was pretty sick. You know how it is...when they get like that.
did he leave any messages, anything?
you're fishing, Sid.
you know what, your father had some data that belonged to me.
he probably saved it on a disk or buried it in the Maru's database.
did he ever mention anything like that to you, ever?
not that I know of.
what kind of data was it?
Oh, nothing really, just...personal journals, visual records, that sort of thing.
Perhaps...you could look for it.
it would mean a lot to me.
and as a matter of fact, ...and I always intended to do this.
if you could help me, I...I might be able to return the favour.
in what way?
do you know what your dad always wanted, more than anything?
to leave you with an inheritance.
enough money so you could do anything you wanted.
well, he left me the Maru.
that's hardly what he wanted.
what do you say I make up the difference?
how about...
...well, how does ten million guilders sound to you?
ten million? - Ten million...
...I see your memory being jogged already.
if you find the files, I need them unopened.
Oh! In the meantime, you should have some fun.
unlimited credit, courtesy Trans-Galactic. Anything you want, it's on me.
a little to the left.
perfect.
I aim to please.
Magnificient.
I wish you would stop looking for beauty in things that want to kill us.
this storm has no intent. It simply is.
can we evade it?
if the neutrino damper is working properly, we should have an excellent margin for safety.
circuit overload.
I think we can safely say, the...damper's defective.
Dylan to command. The lizard stabbed us in the back.
you know, for a while there...
...I thought you were going to sit in the suite and sulk all night and live on bread and water...
okay, you're right. That's the best time I've had in a long time.
Awwww yes! To Unca Sid! - To Uncle Sid!
you know, Trance, what I could do with ten million guilders?
Oh, you could buy lots of drinks with umbrellas in them.
more like fix up the Maru.
pay off my debts... Debts? I could kick back, relax for a change.
so, why don't find that whatchamacallit Sid wants and give it to him?
see, that is the problem,...personal journals and video diaries are not worth that kind of money.
Sid is up to something. - You know...I think he's kinda sweet.
you know, you shouldn't drink. It impairs your judgement.
I'm still trying to figure out this whole poisoning yourself for fun thing. I think I like it.
come on, Trance. We have to check out the Maru.
Hey...exactly where on the body is the moneymaker located?
is this you? - Hmmm...when I was six.
you had red hair!
my dad thought having one hair colour was boring, so he designed these nanobots for me.
I can make my hair whatever colour I want.
Oh, can you do purple?
you should see plaid.
trance, go seal the airlock. - Why?
someone else has been through these files. - What?
seal the hatch. We're leaving.
ahh, don't be so hasty. You still owe me that kiss.
you want a kiss? Kiss this!
so, where were we, hm?
not on my time, Mick!
you should have just taken the money, Rebecca.
it would've made it a lot easier for the both of us.
I've had enough of this bull. I know why you came here.
I told you, to help you. My mistake.
you came answering a three-year old message...
...Two days before my takeover of Quantum. I don't think so.
now where are those files?
even if I knew what the hell you were talking about, which I don't,...
...why do you think I'd tell you now?
somebody's made you a better offer, haven't they?
who is it? Is it Quantum? Spacerunners?
I'm beginning to think your dad's friend is a criminal.
Oh please. It's her father who's the criminal.
you haven't told your friend here the story of your life?
well, it's rather sort of romantic in a pathetic sort of way.
you and your brother, raised like wolves, by a flash-fried drug runner.
that's not true. My father never used flash.
the trust of a child runs deep.
your father never used flash? Let me tell you something.
your father and I practically invented flash.
the lab rats still found nothing, boss. We'll need those codes.
you heard the man.
drop dead.
it's not my life that's on the line here, Rebecca.
Beka? Beka, are you all right?
what did they do to you? - Nothing.
I walked into a door.
well then please sit down.
good girl. Stay.
Oh Trance, I'm not really in the mood for a cocktail right now.
disinfectant.
so did you tell the door what it wanted to know?
I can't tell them anything. I don't know anything.
obviously my dad had something Sid wants very badly.
well, if your father was a drug runner, and Sid was his partner,...
...I would assume... - Get one thing straight.
my father was not a drug addict!
well, I never said that he was. I said he was a drug runner.
that's not the same thing... is it?
no, I guess not.
Slipfighter fuel cells charged. O2 is at 18 percent.
check, and check.
going someplace?
rev, I wish you wouldn't do that. Besides, you are...early.
confession's not supposed to come until after I commit the crime.
I never took you for a man who flees from the consequences of his decisions.
I'm not fleeing. I just have to run an errand.
wanna come? - Most definitely.
don't tell me... You've got a plan.
okay, I won't.
hmm, he always has a plan!
let me get this straight: You're not trying to blackmail me,...
...you don't know what's on the coded data and you've never seen it.
right, right, and right again. You pick this stuff up fast.
I wish I could believe you, Rebecca. I really do.
but you don't, so let's get on with the torture, is that it?
it doesn't have to be this way, Rebecca.
I pride myself on being able to make a deal with anyone, and I mean anyone.
now, I'm going to give you one more chance.
name your price, give me the data, and we'll just pretend this never happened.
I don't want...your money.
so that's it, huh?
my money isn't good enough for the daughter of Ignatius Valentine.
maybe you want something else. Is it revenge?
you blame me for what happened to your father.
should I?
you know, I think you think of him as some sort of hero, out there all alone,...
...fighting the corporate oppressor, coming home with tall tales and trinkets.
who do you think bought those trinkets?
your father was either hung over and forgot,...
...or some hooker rode him in port. Do you know what he used to call you?
blood of my blood.
try "my little ball and chain." - That's not true.
he used to tell me you were not worth the cost...of fuel.
well...
...you really are the daughter of Ignatius Valentine. More's the pity.
flash. It's the ultimate edge. You'll love it!
5 milligrams today, 5 milligrams tomorrow, and the next day, you will be selling your first born...
...for just one milligram more.
it's okay. I'm cool.
take this down,...and log a time and date because we might get out of here.
Sam Profit is going down! And he's going down so hard he's going to create another gravity well in this sector.
just let me at 'im. Just let me at 'im.
six feet, I can jump six feet. - Beka! What...?
flash!
I don't drink, did you know that?
I don't drink. I don't squirt, I don't snort, I don't inhale, I don't...!
I've been straight-edged all my life, all my life...
...because I'm my daddy's little girl, and I don't want to be like my daddy.
here I am, I'm streaking like a fleakin' comet.
you can't stop me.
you can't stop a Valentine with a head full of steam, believe me I know. I tried.
blood of my blood, Trance.
what if it's in my blood? What if I can't stop?!
okay, Beka please, just...try and slow down, all right?
inhale and exhale. Inhale, exhale...
don't TREAT ME LIKE A CHILD! I AM NOT A CHILD! YOU ARE!
or are you? How old are you, Trance?
I don't even know. I don't anything about you.
where you from?
who you're working for?
Why're you purple?
you workin' for Sid?
are you workin' for Sid? You're workin' for him, aren't you?
aren't you, Trance? Trance! Are you? Trance?!
Beka, stop it! Please Beka stop it!
no , no, I could do purple.
okay Beka, you're angry, and it's totally fine to be angry, but please be angry at him!
I know...I know...I know...I know.
trance. Trance, we have to get out of here.
I know where it is.
all right, come away. It's okay.
where is he?
I'm sorry, Captain Hunt has stepped away from his desk.
please leave a message after the tone from the funny little guy. Beep!
are you amused?
we have at best eight hours before that storm reduces us to component parts, and Dylan has disappeared.
I don't know. Ask Rev Bem, maybe he knows.
he's missing ,too!
try decaf.
back to normal? N'okay?
I will be.
robbed of my superpowers, I will have to rely on mere human ingenuity.
Oh, how are we going to get out of here?
let me think. Ummm...how about.this one?
Yeee-yeah!
sorry sweetie, the room don't come with a view.
Ohhh, I've been waitin' for this.
it's personalized to my own DNA...moron.
let's get them comm gear and let's get them out of here.
did I mention I'm not having fun yet?
nor I. Ship! I'm assuming command.
engage thrusters and take us out of here.
permission to come aboard, Captain Anasazi.
how often do you get the chance to get up close and personal with a class-seven solar storm?
it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, don't you agree?
you can't keep me here, I'm a highly respected businessman.
not on my ship, you're not. - You must understand,...
...I have to get back to the warehouse. My employees will steal me blind!
Oh, I do understand.
I understand that honesty and integrity were casualties of war,...
...and while I may not approve... for the record,...
I don't approve...right now, my bad day is your bad day.
enjoy the view.
welcome to our humble abode. - Keep that cannibal away from me!
uh, cannibal? No.
see, he doesn't eat his own kind. Chichin, however...
when their whining exceeds a certain... decibel level,...
...I find it very difficult to control my lower nature.
how much longer before the storm reaches its peak?
I wouldn't crack open any epic novels if I were you.
we might be able to hold together.
course, we'd be a lot safer if we had a working neutrino damper.
a damper?
you need a neutrino damper? What a coincidence,...
...I can get you a damper, a beautiful brand-new damper you will be proud to call your own.
you don't say...
this way.
I'm busy, Mick! - I know.
we've got a problem.
the blonde...tased me and the purple girl disabled the security grid.
they barricaded themselves in the room.
scuse me gentlemen.
listen to me, I want you to do exactly as I tell you...
trance, when did we leave the Andromeda?
how long've we been away? - I'd say this makes...five days,...
...but sometimes I lose count when I'm unconscious.
I was afraid of that. I told Dylan I'd be back by now.
probably thinks I ditched him. - Beka, I can hear them!
they're outside. Hurry up! - I just need one...more...minute.
I don't think we have another minute.
give it up girls, there's no way outta here.
wrong again. - Right! What?
hold your breath.
that was easy.
boss? Worked just like you said.
I'm wondering......if she's coming back.
what makes you say that?
well, you've spent the last three months helping her upgrade her ship.
you've armed it, you've rebuilt its engines and computers.
I think it's possible she may have taken advantage of your generosity and gone back for her own business.
because that's what you would do.
not after warning you.
so is this the point where he starts shooting at us?
well, I'm betting he won't kill us until he finds that data.
which we have?
okay, here's what I remember: "My dad and Sid were partners.
they built the Maru together.
they were always planning and scheming about getting rich.
until this one deal.
this was going to be the big score, the best deal ever.
and then, I don't know, it fizzled somehow.
dad and I went to Signa Gamma One to meet Sid,...
...and as soon as we got there, we just turned right around and...left.
no money, no cargo, no Sid.
as far as I know, that's the last time they saw each other.
autopilot engaged.
I'm betting whatever Sid's looking for has something to do with that trip.
well, he would've found the Eureka Maru's log by now, wouldn't he?
Yeah, if it was in the logs. - What are you doing?
remember when I told you that my dad made nanobots for my hair?
he did it as soon as we left Sig Gamma One.
Sid didn't even notice.
he hid his secret in your hair?
my dad may have been an addict, but he knew his nano-tech.
if I'm right, these little robots did a heck of a lot more than change my hair colour.
they recorded Sid's missing data on a molecular level.
zeros and ones, all adding up to this.
Signa Gamma One docking station.
Sid. Sid, are you there?
daddy.
they're dead.
they're all dead.
Ohhh Sid...
you think they'd just wave through a ten-ton shipment of flash?
Sid, what have you done??
I did what I had to do, as always.
you talk like a man... whose hands are clean.
I'm a thief. I'm a smuggler. I am not a murderer!
well you are now.
you're watching it, aren't you?
Sid. What did you do?
are you really never saw it? You really didn't? Heh.
paranoia. Kinda gets to you when you're in my line of work.
when you're a murderer?
Oh, it wasn't supposed to happen that way, Rebecca. Honestly.
somebody must've tipped off Signa customs.
you know the punishment for drug-smuggling on Signa Gamma One?
they chop you up for spare parts.
I had to protect myself, protect us both.
and then your father, he had the gall to blackmail me.
with the recording. - He was so pathetic.
he never asked for much, just a few guilders here and there,...
...a spare part or two, but there was always that recording hanging over my head.
and then,...
...then he fried himself on flash and I figured it was all over.
until I decided to buy my way into Trans-Galactic.
you were worried that I'd start using the tape against you.
I have always had a soft-spot for you, Rebecca.
and I figured that we could come to an arrangement.
that's when I sent you that message. But you never responded.
and then three years later, you show up on my doorstep?
what was I supposed to think? - You thought I'd ruin your deal.
you know, a ruined deal is one thing,...
...but to lose one's life... Sentiment only goes so far.
my feeling is, when it comes to destroying evidence,...
...nothing beats a sun. - Sun?
disengage autopilot!
authorization denied.
I helped build the Maru, remember?
little help here!
I'm sorry Rebecca, but I've had my fill of Valentines.
Incoming...
it's not gonna do you any good, you know. You're too late.
you think that was the only hair on my head?
back in the suite, I beamed the log to the Freelance Courier Co-op.
by now it's on its way to every law-enforcement agency in the quadrant:
open immediately upon my death." - You're bluffing.
you couldn't afford the courier fees. - I know, but you can.
unlimited credit, remember?
if anything happens to me, and I mean anything, you are front page news in three galaxies.
not bad kiddo. Not bad at all.
runs in the family. - All right, here's the deal:
I let you live, and you sit on that recording, and nobody ever sees it, because if it ever sees the light of day, I have nothing to lose.
your secret's safe.
as long as I'm alive. So you'd better wish me a long and healthy life.
why wouldn't I? After all, what are uncles for?
it's responding!
good! Get us outta here. - Okay.
Dylan, she is thirty-six hours late.
and I simply don't see why you should keep a bargain when she doesn't.
an incoming communication for you Dylan.
put it through.
this is the Eureka Maru, requesting permission to land, Captain Hunt sir.
affirmative, Eureka Maru. You're late.
Yeah, I know. - We know.
glad to have you back.
you know, whenever I think about my father, I picture him at the end. I try not to, but I still do. It was hard.
I have to just remember that those were just a few years in a long life.
when I was a kid, when he was young, he was the best, Trance.
he was smart, and funny, and tough. And brave.
he could make me laugh until my sides hurt.
no matter how dark things got, and no matter how long the odds, he always... always came up with a plan.
the right plan.
I wish you could've met him Trance.
Yeah, me too.
but you know, that's okay because... I know his daughter.
blood of his blood, Beka.
blood of his blood.
Hello!
Yes, this is Harold Angel.
Yes, initial R, like in the phone book.
excuse me?
hold on a second!
mackintosh. I've got it!
of course I know what an attorney is.
it's like a lawyer, only the bills are bigger.
sure, I'll hold.
asshole!
Hello, Mr. Winesap? Harold Angel.
Yeah, I could be free.
would this be with your firm?
gimme that again.
Louis . . . how do you spell that?
Cyphre . . . okay. What is it . . . foreign?
is your client a foreigner?
Mr. Winesap, could you give me a few more details?
okay, I know the place.
it's a long way up, but I can be there.
Hallelujah! Show right now how much you love God!
I want you to show! It's your time!
open up your hearts and open up your wallets!
open your purses!
open your pockets!
and give it up! Praise the Lord! Somebody has been talking about me riding around in a Cadillac. If you love me and want to give to me, then I should be in a Rolls-Royce!
would you come with me, please?
an unfortunate husband of one of Pastor John's flock took a gun to his head. Most unpleasant.
Mr. Angel? Please?
allow me to introduce my client, Monsieur Louis Cyphre.
Hi, Harry Angel. - Pleased to meet you, Mr. Angel.
I don't want to appear impolite, but do you have any l. D? - Sure! Here . . .
how's that?
gun PERMIT
nothing personal. I'm a little over-cautious.
you know how these things are. - I know. So . . .
how did you hear about me?
I guess you guys just looked in the phone book.
usually that's what happens. Because my name is "Angel," it's under "A" . . .
people are lazy. They see the first name and . . . - Johnny Favorite.
excuse me?
do you by chance remember the name Johnny Favorite?
Johnny . . . no, I don't think so.
you never knew him? - Am I supposed to?
he was a crooner before the war, quite famous in his way.
well, I tell you, Mr. Cyphre . . .
I'm sorry!
I usually don't get involved in anything very heavy. I usually handle insurance jobs, divorces, things of that nature.
if I'm lucky sometimes I handle people. But I don't know no crooners or anybody famous. - His real name was Liebling.
I don't know any Liebling, either.
what do you want from me?
does this man owe you money? - Not quite.
I helped Johnny at the beginning of his career.
you were like . . . his agent?
No!
nothing so . . .
Monsieur Cyphre has a contract.
certain collateral was to be forfeited in the event of his death.
, and his head and face was badly injured.
he had . . . - Amnesia. I think you call it . . .
shell shock. - Exactly! - I know how that feels.
Why? Were you in the services? - I was in for a short time.
but I got a little fucked up.
excuse me! They shipped me home, and I missed the whole shebang:
the war, the medals, everything. I guess you could say I was lucky.
Johnny wasn't so lucky. He returned home a zombie.
his friends had him transferred to a private hospital upstate.
there was some sort of radical psychiatric treatment involved.
. but you know how it is.
he remained a vegetable, and my contract was never honored. - I see.
I don't want to sound mercenary.
my only interest in Johnny is in finding out if he's alive or dead.
each year my office receives a signed affidavit confirming that Johnny Liebling is indeed among the living.
but last weekend Monsieur Cyphre and l, just by chance, were near the clinic in Poughkeepsie.
we decided to check for ourselves, but we got misleading information.
the run-around!
I didn't want to cause a scene, I hate any sort of fuss.
I thought, perhaps you could subtly and in a quiet manner . . .
you want me to check it out. - Check it out!
I have a feeling I've met you before.
I don't know, I don't think so.
do you remember the name Johnny Favorite?
his real name was Liebling.
my only interest in Johnny is in finding out if he's alive or dead.
may I help you? - My name is Harry Conroy from the National lnstitute of Health.
is there anyone in particular you want to see?
the lnstitute is conducting a survey of incurable trauma cases.
I understand you have a patient here fitting that description?
we can't let you see anyone without an appointment.
I appreciate that, but maybe you could check the files and make sure I'm on the right track.
I don't want to bother anybody unnecessarily.
okay? Thank you.
what's the name of the patient? - Liebling, Jonathan Liebling.
one moment please, I'll check.
were you working here last weekend?
no, day off. - Did you do anything nice?
my sister's wedding.
we did have a Mr. Liebling, but he was transferred.
you sure? - That's what it says.
and when was that? - Years ago, in December '43.
may I take a look at this? Thanks.
is this recent?
it's an old file. - It's in ballpoint!
they weren't big on ballpoint in '43.
is that ballpoint?
well, I'll be! They didn't have ballpoints back then?
no.
this here
Dr. Fowler, does he still work here? - Just part-time, he's old.
thank you.
time for your evening fix?
who are you? How did you get in here?
through the mailslot. I'm a private detective.
breaking and entering is a crime, whoever or whatever you are. - Hey man, call the police!
which you won't do in case they discover your opium den in the icebox!
I'm a doctor. I'm perfectly entitled to keep pharmaceuticals at home.
tell it to somebody else! We're not talking about a Band-Aid or a tube of unguent. How long you been hooked? - What do you want?
information about Johnny Liebling.
I treated a patient of that name many years ago.
I'm not fooling around.
either you give me some answers or I'll call the police myself.
I've seen the works cooking upstairs, and it ain't Mr. Salk's vaccine.
he was an entertainer during the war, a neuro case.
no chance of recovery, so I transferred him to a V. A. hospital in Albany.
I hate to shake you up, but I checked, and he's not there.
you faked the transfer.
because he recently had a visitor, the first in 12 years.
popular guy, eh?
where is he now? - I don't know . . . - Come here!
I haven't seen him since he was a patient here.
you're in a cold sweat! Look at you!
you can't wait for me to leave so you can raid the icebox.
the sooner you get out with it, the sooner you can shoot up.
I'll ask you again: Where is he?
I don't know.
some people came one night years ago. He got in the car with them and left.
he got into a car? I thought this guy was a vegetable.
at first he was in a coma but he quickly recovered.
but he still suffered from amnesia.
the friends.
who were the friends? - His name was Kelley, Edward Kelley.
the young lady I don't know. She stayed in the car.
where did they take him? - Down South. The man said: "We're taking him home."
and what was the deal? - $25, 000.
for what? - I was supposed to pretend that he was still a patient in hospital.
didn't the administration suspect? - Why should they? I kept the charts up to date. And no one asks questions when the bills get paid.
tell me about Johnny Liebling.
what did he look like? - No idea. His face was damaged.
he had facial reconstruction. He was in bandages the day he left.
what can you tell me about Kelley?
it's too long ago. I only have a vague memory.
he was well dressed and had a southern accent.
I truly don't remember. - All right, Doc. Have a lie down.
I'm going out to grab a cheeseburger.
maybe a few hours cold turkey will refresh your memory.
watch yourself!
we're going to take a little nap, sit your ass down.
we're going to clear your mind.
I'm going out. When I get back,
I'll fix you some goodies from the icebox, alright?
tell me what I want to know and you'll get rid of me forever.
I'm back, Doc! I brought you a little something!
I didn't think you'd want a cheeseburger . . .
I will! Bye!
Hi, Ellie!
is that your boyfriend?
he's got a car and everything?
see you later!
did you see him? - No.
why not? - It would've been difficult. - Why?
Why? Because he's not there.
Johnny Favorite walked out of the clinic 1 2 years ago, in his best suit, with a new face wrapped in bandages and a headache.
he left with a guy called Kelley and a girl. Do you know this Kelley?
it seems this Kelley paid off some bent doctor called Fowler to pinch hit for your guy. He's covered up for him all these years.
looks like our Johnny has a perfect disappearing act. - It seems so.
but you know what they say about slugs.
no, what do they say about slugs?
they always leave slime in their tracks.
you'll find him. - No, I won't find him.
because I left out one little detail.
this Dr. Fowler ended up dead with his fucking brains blown out.
did you kill him? - No!
but the cops might think I did.
I took on a $125-a-day missing persons job for you.
now, I'm a murder suspect. That's it! I'm out.
such are the hazards of your profession. If the fee bothers you, we'll adjust it.
you bother me!
the closest I ever come to death is watching a hearse go by on 2nd Avenue. That's the way I like it.
are you afraid?
Yeah, I'm afraid.
I'll instruct my lawyer immediately to send you a check for $5, 000.
if you don't want the job, I'll engage someone else.
you want this Johnny pretty bad, eh?
I don't like messy accounts.
some religions think the egg is the symbol of the soul, did you know that?
no.
would you like an egg?
no, thank you. I got a thing about chickens.
it's after eleven, you're late. - I'm sorry.
you get it? - If I lose my job,
I'll come and be your secretary.
I couldn't pay you what the "Times" pays. Besides, they won't miss it.
Hi, Johnny, where the fuck are you?
he really was a crooner, like you said. I didn't realize he was so big.
he was in a band called the Spider Simpson Orchestra. They're all dead.
only Spider is here in town. - Where? - I wrote it all down.
the dyke in the archive is suspicious.
my boss hasn't researched the story in years.
you can get the files.
spider is in an old people's home on 1 38th Street.
Oh, I get to go to Harlem again.
there was a picture of Johnny with Toots Sweet, a guitar player.
no one's heard of him for years!
Johnny was engaged to a rich broad,
Margaret Krusemark. Her dad owns half of Louisiana.
met him at a high school prom. Johnny shit on her, and she went back to Daddy.
there's lots on their spells.
spells, what do you mean, spells?
the eye of a newt, toe of a frog and that kind of shit? - Seems she was a bit of a crackpot.
casting spells at society do's and stuff.
didn't go down too well with the lvy League stiffos.
she was known as the Witch of Wellesly.
did I do good?
great! So what've I got: A religious loonie as a client.
I gotta find Johnny "Golden Tonsils" and we don't know where he is.
and he probably doesn't know who he is.
I got a geriatric bandleader in a home in Harlem.
I got a guitar player called Toots Sweet.
what else have I got?
a hard-on?
are you okay?
january 3rd, 1 955. Client: Louis Cyphre. Copy: Winesap & Mackintosh, attorneys. As reported, Johnny Favorite has not been in the Sarah Dodd Clinic in Poughkeepsie for the last 1 2 years.
he was taken away by a man called Edward Kelley and a girl.
the girl is unidentified.
kelley paid a Dr. Fowler $25, 000 to falsify reports stating that Favorite was still in the hospital.
the doctor is now deceased.
before Johnny's accident it seemed like his career was going great, until he started to dump on everyone. I tracked down Spider Simpson,
Johnny's old bandleader. He resides at the Lincoln Presbyterian Hospice on 138th Street. Johnny also had a good buddy, a guitar player called Toots Sweet. Toots went back to Algiers.
that's Algiers in New Orleans.
I think maybe Margaret went back there, and maybe Johnny, too.
Oh, yeah! According to Spider, Johnny had a secret love.
a black lady called Evangeline Proudfoot.
Evangeline ran some kind of spooky store in Harlem called "Mammy Carter's.
you don't need to know that, Cyphre. I think a secret love should stay secret.
the only person who Johnny was seeing regularly was a palm reader in Coney lsland called Madame Zora.
are you lzzy?
looks like the last bit of sun, eh?
the guy in the arcade over there told me you might be able to help me.
I'm looking for Madame Zora. - I know her, friend of the wife before the war.
she was a fortune teller, right? - And then some!
I hate those hocus-pocus bitches! Her and the wife got along real well.
wife's a baptist. Oh, here!
have a nose shield!
go on, take one. I found a whole boxful under the boardwalk.
there's not much sun right now.
Yeah, but it keeps the rain off too.
ever hear of a Johnny Favorite?
the singer? - Yeah, he used to visit Madame Zora.
heard of him, but don't know nothing. Ask the wife.
she always sings stupid tunes off the radio. She knows all that shit.
she likes the water, eh? - She hates it.
she's getting on the heavy side. She thinks it's good for varicose veins.
alright, thanks.
what do you do here in the summer?
bite the heads off the rats.
and in the winter? - The same.
excuse me!
I was just talking to your husband.
I was inquiring about Madame Zora.
Yeah, I knew her before the war, Madame Zora, you say?
Yeah, she was a gypsy fortune teller!
had the booth across the boardwalk from me. She was a debutante not a gypsy, and she did more than just read tea leaves.
did you ever see her with a guy called Johnny Favorite? - Yeah, he was cute.
she was stuck on him. He was called "Golden Tonsils." I knew all his tunes.
have you ever heard of a Margaret Krusemark?
don't be a gazoony, fellah! Madame Zora was Margaret Krusemark.
well what happened to her?
packed up her stuff and went back home, down south.
you have any idea where I could find Johnny Favorite?
no, maybe the cemetery. Want to hear one of his tunes?
thanks for the nose shield. I'm going to need it where I'm going.
in Brooklyn? - Louisiana. - Nice.
Where'd he go?
for COLORED PATRONS ONLY
Mr. Angel? Sorry to keep you waiting, but you're a little early.
I had a bad line. I didn't know if you said 4: 00 or 4: 30.
this is a wild place you got here! - Yes, I've been very happy here.
I've never had my fortune read before. Does it take long?
I'll take the details now. It usually takes a couple of days to do a chart.
tea?
do you want some tea?
Yes, thank you.
darjeeling, jasmine or oolong?
not many people like oolong.
do you play the piano?
no, not exactly.
sing?
I can carry a tune, but no . . . not really.
who is this mean looking guy?
my father.
I'm sorry!
don't worry, he hates it too.
he looks like one of those guys in an old pirate movie. What's his name?
well, I tell you, I never saw any of Ethan's movies.
do you speak French?
I'm from Brooklyn.
I would prefer it if you didn't smoke. - That's okay.
cream or sugar?
straight up is fine, thank you.
I need your exact date of birth.
sure!
I was born on February 14th . . .
. . . 1918, on Valentine's day.
how curious! I used to know a boy who was born on that exact same day.
well, you know how it is, all the soldiers home on leave and all.
maybe we could pull your friend's chart and save ourselves some time.
I don't think so. Every person is very different. I don't think you'd like his chart.
place of birth?
Brooklyn, New York. Was your friend a jerk or something?
you could say that.
I guess you didn't get along.
you and Johnny.
you and Johnny Favorite?
who are you? - I was an old army buddy.
I thought you two were kinda . . .
look, I ain't no army buddy, I'm just a guy who was paid to snoop around.
to tell the truth, I wasn't born on Valentine's day.
it's Johnny's future I'm interested in.
Johnny has no future, he's dead.
he died 1 2 years ago. I'd like you to leave.
I know you're thinking who is this creep poking his snitch in everything.
I don't want to sound nosy, but . . . - He's dead, Mr. Angel.
and if he isn't, he is to me.
he must've hurt you pretty bad!
we all have our scars.
I don't know too much about the guy, but he must've been stupid to let you go.
lies and cruelty come very easily to some people.
pity, I really would've liked to have gotten my palm read.
then I could have held your hand just a little longer.
I don't think you'd like what I see.
very pretty necklace!
you got any High John the Conquerer root? - Powdered or hanging?
I'm not really sure.
caught in the rain, eh?
two roots, $1 . 20.
I have a question. I had an acquaintance in Harlem who used to deal in the root.
name was Evangeline. Heard of her?
practically everyone around here is called Evangeline. After the poem.
do you know it?
Yeah, I know it.
this acquaintance had a store in Harlem and it was the same name:
Carter." - Everybody uses the name, Mister.
like "Howard Johnson," but this is the real place.
her name was Proudfoot.
I knew her. She used to come back all the time when she lived in New York.
do you know where she is now? - She got sick and died.
she went back to the Holy Shelter swamp and was buried in Armandville.
she was waiting on some fellah. - Just like in the poem? - Yep.
who was the guy? - She never told.
okay, thanks.
a week, you say? - At the most.
what is it?
why are you crying?
we're going to Grandma. What's there?
grandma.
grandma.
let's go.
give me your hand.
I'm sorry! I got these off a guy in Coney lsland.
some crazy guy.
I'm sorry.
stop crying.
I was hoping I could talk with your mother.
you're a little late. Did you know her?
no, I never met her but I was hoping she could answer some questions for me.
are you a cop?
no, my name is Harry Angel.
I'm a private detective.
so what's . . ? - Epiphany.
your mama left you with a very beautiful name.
and not much else.
actually, I'm looking for a friend of your mother's, a guy called Johnny Favorite.
I met all her friends but never anyone called Favorite.
shit!
I got a thing about chickens.
this Favorite was friends with your mother in New York city before the war.
well, she never told me. Mama had a lot of guys. She liked men.
how about a guy called Toots Sweet?
he was a friend of Favorite. Know him? - No. - He was a good guitar player.
I was going to catch his act tonight.
I'm going to be staying in town, in a hotel.
if you remember anything that might help me, give me a call.
you're a very pretty girl, Epiphany, your name suits you.
these crazy chickens!
what are you after him for, Johnny Favorite?
I'm not after him. I'm just being paid to find out where he is.
he could be 6 feet under. - Then I'll have to buy a shovel.
how are you, sugar?
some beautiful tune you were singing there, Mr. Sweet. - Toots, son! Thanks. - Buy you a drink?
mine's on the house. Special cocktail. Whatever's in it gives a big kick.
you know, I heard you play years ago in New York.
before the war at the old Dickie Wells Bar.
you were having it up pretty good with a guy called Johnny Favorite.
Yeah, I vaguely remember. - You and he were buddies, weren't you?
no, he recorded one of my songs. Say, are you a dick or a book writer?
neither. I'm a journalist and I'm doing this piece about Johnny and the Spider Simpson Orchestra.
spider played them drums like two jackrabbits fucking!
haven't got much time. Got to piss, spit and get back to work.
try one of those cocktails. Then you can make the whole thing up as you like.
that's what you usually do, anyway.
I can't even take a piss!
I just wanted to talk about Johnny Favorite and Evangeline Proudfoot.
I'm too big to go hiding under beds. I don't know nothing.
I'm only interested in cocktails. Fuck!
what's going on? - Nothing! Mind your own business. I want to piss!
get outta here, or you'll wish your little white ass was never born.
please! I've got a thing about chickens.
end of bullshit time!
I've had a good look at you and young Epiphany doing your hot shoe number with the chicken.
listen!
I ain't up on this voodoo shit. I'm from Brooklyn.
we ain't all Baptists here. - What's with this Proudfoot girl?
she's a mambo priestess, like her mom. Has been since she was 1 3.
when was the last time you saw Johnny Favorite at a chicken dance?
he used to run around with Ma mambo. - I ain't seen him since before the war.
and the chicken foot in the john? - It means I got a big mouth.
it's not big enough. What's this fucking star in your mouth? I'll tell you what.
I'll give you my hotel number. Gimme a call if you hear anything.
you never know.
next time you get a delivery of a chicken foot, you might need help.
as far as I'm concerned, any dead chicken is a good chicken.
only cops and bad news don't knock.
only private dicks sleep late.
quite a dream you were having! - I was on my way to Mandalay.
shit! There's some leak up there!
here! ls this your name?
that your hotel?
you're standing in it, ain't you? - Your handwriting?
I think so.
then perhaps you can tell us why we found it in the hand of a dead guitar player.
Toots Sweet is dead?
this one wasn't so quick, this one took time.
how did he die?
technically? Asphyxiation by his own genitalia.
and not so technically?
they cut his dick off and choked him with it.
then redecorated his apartment with his blood.
when did you see him? - I interviewed him around 1: 00. - About what?
a missing person.
who?
a guy who took a walk 1 2 years ago.
there was a photo of him and Toots. - Who is the party you're looking for?
I can't say. I'm working for a New York lawyer.
name? - Come on, man!
Winesap! You want his number, his address?
ask Tess Truehart over there, it's in the book.
under "W," genius! - Do you know Ted Williams, the baseball player?
alright, is that it, guys?
that's it.
you can go eat lunch, but don't stroll too far.
not until we talk to this lawyer.
ever watch the "Mickey Mouse Club?"
do you know what today is?
today is Wednesday.
it's "anything can happen" day.
hey man, do you want a tune?
Yeah, I got a tune for you.
Hiya, boys!
same to you. I'm getting kinda hungry.
do you want to sell some of those?
10 cents a sack. - Sure, give me a sack.
listen good! Margaret Krusemark's old man wants you on the first train home.
take that fucking thing away from me!
don't, or the dog will bite your fucking face clean off.
what happened to you?
a dog bit me.
so, what do you want?
right now, I need a laundry.
listen, Epiphiny . . . - Epiphany.
there's something I want to ask you.
the other night I saw you and Toots boogying with the cock-a-doodle.
looked like you were having some party.
what's your problem? It's a free country.
not for chickens. - Oh yeah, your thing about chickens.
listen, Toots is . . .
Toots is dead. - I know, I heard.
you set him up. - No, I didn't.
you were the only one that knew I was seeing Toots.
you sent the gift-wrapped chicken foot, didn't you?
Toots had a big mouth.
I guess he did, judging by what the cops found in it.
quite a cute religion! - Nailing a man to a cross ain't so cute either!
you've got to kill the chicken to make the soup, eh?
we don't go around murdering people. What about your Johnny Favorite?
now you remember him after all. - Yes, he was my father.
I'll pick the baby up later, okay? - He'll be all right.
anything you're holding out, now is a good time to tell.
nothing to tell.
Johnny never came back from the war.
mama waited and Mama died. Sad and simple.
there's too many dead bodies floating around, even for Louisiana.
I'd tell your old man to look out for you.
you do have a husband? - No.
no?
Jesus, you've got beautiful eyes!
really.
the kind of eyes that tell what's going on inside.
right now, you're scared. - I'll manage.
listen . . . - Yes, I'll call you if I hear anything.
call me if you don't.
alright?
I have a message for you.
thank you. - You're welcome.
I'm so glad you could come. - I didn't know you were in town.
I'm speaking in Baton Rouge and thought I'd catch up on your progress.
I'll tell you, the progress ain't too good.
I've found out a lot of stuff, but so far . . . no Johnny Favorite.
how unfortunate! - All I've got is a belly full of hocus-pocus and . . .
3 stiffs.
dead bodies, Mr. Cyphre.
murders.
I got Fowler, Johnny's doctor, bumped himself off.
this old voodoo guy Toots Sweet.
he got choked to death with a part of the body meant for pissing with . . .
this is a church!
the whole thing has to do with religion. It's very weird.
I don't understand it. It's ugly.
they say there's enough religion to make men hate each other but not love.
do they say that?
I'll tell you something. There wasn't much love around for Johnny Favorite.
he was bad luck!
it's starting to rub off on me. I'm a murder suspect already in two cases.
the police found my name and my address in Toots Sweets' hand.
I know, Winesap told me. You must be careful, Mr. Angel.
and the third murder?
I checked out Johnny's old society girlfriend, Margaret Krusemark.
do you know her? - Vaguely.
Vaguely? I'm a little fed up with fucking vaguely.
Vaguely" is putting a noose around my neck and I'm choking, so . . .
did you know her or not?
I knew about her, but I never actually knew her.
tell you what, she was doing my chart.
I gave her Johnny's birthday, February 14th.
except someone got to her and took out their own Valentine's card.
they slit her open and cut out her heart.
I guess she couldn't predict the future for herself.
the future isn't what it used to be.
and your conclusions? - I haven't any.
all I know is that Johnny is running around bumping off everyone he knew.
and more and more, it's me who's on the line for it.
I'm being set up and it's scaring the shit out of me.
so why don't you just level with me and tell me what the fuck is going on?
just Johnny Favorite and the debt that's owed to me.
I have old-fashioned ideas, about honour.
an eye for an eye, things like that.
who the fuck are you?
watch your language!
I don't give a fuck, if this is a church.
I don't like churches. - Are you an atheist?
Yes, I'm from Brooklyn.
I'll be in town for a day or two, let me know what else you find, and if you need more money . . . - No!
but if I'm not careful, that 5, 000 bucks you gave me could buy me a seat on the electric chair.
frightened eyes never lie.
come on! Come inside!
Where's your child? - He's at Mincie's. She'll bring him.
she's got 14 of her own, so he'll be okay there.
you're welcome to stay here, or I can get you a room.
no, it's okay.
I'm going to have a drink. Want one?
well, have one anyway.
I've been thinking . . .
what the hell did your mother see in a guy like Johnny Favorite?
I don't know. Whatever he had, it sure stole her heart away.
to tell you the truth, the guy was a creep.
she sure missed him.
what does a lady see in a guy who runs around chopping up pigeons?
they say it's always the bad-asses who make a girl's heart beat faster.
did she ever say anything about him?
just two things. - What?
that Johnny Favorite was as close to true evil as she ever wanted to come.
what else?
that he was a terrific lover.
how old are you?
kind of young to have a kid, isn't it?
old enough.
where did the father go? - I never knew him.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I took this room.
I can't believe this!
it was a Bambouche. When spirits possess you, it's called "chevalier."
I know that: Chevrolet.
Chevalier. - That's what I said: Chevrolet. - Mounted by the gods.
so the gods got you pregnant? I understand now. I'm sorry.
I'm not. It was the best fuck I ever had.
want to dance?
here?
Yes, here.
I got bit by a dog this morning, I can't move around.
you won't feel a thing.
alright, I'll dance with you.
but you've got to promise. - What's that? - No chickens!
alright, I'm coming!
I should've recognised the knock.
at least you got a reason for sleeping late.
down here we don't mess with jigaboos. The colored folks keep to themselves.
I'm not from down here. - You cut yourself?
dog bit me.
somebody called Margaret Krusemark figure in your missing persons case?
no, why? - She's dead. That nigger guitar player of yours, he didn't matter a shit. He was into voodoo, they 86 each other every week.
but this Krusemark dame, she comes from a Louisiana money family.
two people bumped off in a week, what's the connection?
similar circumstances!
did she have her dick cut off too? - No!
some fucker cut her heart out, neat as a butcher.
look, mine's a missing persons, it's not a murder.
I want the name of the party you're looking for. - Talk to the lawyer.
I did. A fancy mouthpiece, gave me the same big city shit as you.
what should I say? Why don't you and Effie Klinker just fuck off and leave me alone? - You ass-wipe!
you play jump rope with Louisiana law and I'm going to stick your big city smarts right up your New York ass.
this Krusemark was into black magic and all that shit.
nothing is worse for a cop than people who get killed for nutso reasons.
sorry about the mess. Maybe your nigger can clean it up.
what are you singing?
it's by Johnny Favorite. My mother used to sing it all the time.
you okay?
shit!
what do you want, Mr. Angel?
I thought you knew. - Why should l?
two of your morons with a matching poodle have been chasing me for days.
I'm looking for Johnny Favorite.
as far as I know, that dance band scumbag is dead.
that dance band scumbag probably killed your daughter.
who is employing you? - I can't say.
I'll pay. - So do they.
1 2 years ago, you and your daughter snatched Favorite from the nut hatch.
you gave a junkie doctor 25 grand to pretend Johnny was still there.
you did a good job until a week ago.
you used the name Edward Kelley.
let's go over here. It's a little private and you can sample our Gumbo.
I've got an acid stomach. Cajun cooking kills me.
pity about your stomach! You'd have enjoyed our Gumbo.
I was Edward Kelley. It was me who paid Fowler the 25 grand.
did Favorite know you? - No.
he acted like a sleep walker. He looked out of the window at the lights.
where were you taking him? - Times Square. New Years Eve, '43.
we dropped him off in the crowd, and he disappeared forever.
or so we thought.
you're telling me you paid 25 grand for a guy and lost him in a crowd?
I did it for my daughter.
some sort of hocus-pocus she and Johnny were fooling with. She was obsessed.
I know, I found a mummified hand in her room.
the hand of glory. It's supposed to open any lock.
it was the right hand of a murderer, cut off while his neck was in the noose.
that's what Margaret believed.
black magic! - Black, white, what's the difference? Margaret was always . . .
evil. - Evil as a dunghill.
everyone speaks about someone else. Margaret wasn't evil.
she was a strange kid! She was into Tarot cards before she could read.
who got her started? - Some maid, or governess, who knows.
everything you tell me is a crock of shit!
you got her started!
you're a devil worshipper! - The Prince of Darkness protects the powerful.
shit! - I can't help if you don't believe it.
come straight with me, you slime-bag, or I'll save the state an execution!
I introduced Johnny Favorite to my daughter.
I watched him conjure up Lucifer in my home. He was deeper in it than me.
he made a pact with Satan. He sold his soul.
you expect me to swallow that? - I don't give a damn!
that's a crock of shit, you lying toad!
he sold his soul for stardom. - For stardom?
Satan rose from the depths.
but he tried to outwit the Prince of Darkness.
when he made it big, he tried to duck out of it.
that's a crock of shit!
Johnny found an obscure rite in an ancient manuscript. He needed a victim.
someone his own age. - Why? - To steal their soul.
Toots and Johnny picked up a young soldier.
who? - Just a soldier celebrating New Year's Eve in New York.
they took him back to Johnny's hotel, where they had the ceremony.
what ceremony?
the boy was bound naked on a rubber mat, there were complicated incantations.
a pentacle was branded on his chest.
Margaret gave Johnny a virgin dagger.
he sliced the boy clean open and ate his heart.
it was still beating when he wolfed it down.
Johnny wanted to become that soldier.
before he had worked it out, he was drafted, injured and sent home without even knowing who he was.
who was the boy?
only Johnny knew. He put the dog tags in a vase and gave it to Margaret.
it was Margaret's plan to drop him off in Times Square.
the last place he remembered before it happened.
he needed a victim. Someone his own age.
to steal their soul.
he sliced the boy clean open and he ate his heart.
who was the boy?
Johnny wanted to be the soldier.
maybe he gained the guy's soul, but he still looked like Johnny to me.
I know who I am!
alas . . .
how terrible is wisdom if it brings no profit to the wise, Johnny.
even your name is a dime store joke.
"Mephistopheles" is such a mouthful in Manhattan, Johnny.
do you think posing as the devil, just because it scared a superstitious old guitar player, and that witch, and that nutty old man, do you think it's going to scare me? It ain't, because I know who I am.
you killed them, and you're trying to pin it on me.
I know who I am.
if I had cloven hooves and a tail, would you be more convinced?
you're crazy.
I know who I am. You're trying to frame me.
you're trying to frame me.
I know who I am. You murdered them people! I never killed nobody!
I didn't kill Fowler,
I didn't kill Toots, and I didn't kill Margaret or Krusemark.
I killed no one.
I'm afraid you did, Johnny. - My name's not Johnny!
all killed by your own hand. Guided by me, naturally.
you were doomed from the moment you slit that young boy in half.
you've been living on borrowed time and another man's memories for 1 2 years.
I want to tell Winesap, he knows! - He's dead.
nasty accident!
don't worry, no one will mourn one less lawyer. Death's everywhere these days.
but what gives human life its worth, anyway?
because someone loves it, hates it.
the flesh is weak. Only the soul is immortal.
and yours belongs to me!
I know who I am.
that's it Johnny, take a good look!
however cleverly you sneak up on the mirror, your reflection always looks you straight in the eye. - I know who I am.
I know who I am!
why did you come back?
I live here.
who is she?
she ain't: Angel, Harold.
she's my daughter.
bullshit! Who is she?
she stayed here for a little while.
long enough for you to kill her? Or ain't that your gun up her snatch?
you're going to burn for this.
I know.
in hell!
Hello, and good morning.
I am Rabbi lsidor Chemelwitz of the Bronx Home for Aged Hebrews.
we are here this morning to pay respect for the passing of Sarah lronson...
devoted wife of Benjamin lronson.
also deceased.
loving and caring mother of their sons...
Morris, Abraham, and Samuel...
and their daughters Esther and Rachel.
beloved grandmother of Max...
mark, Louis, Angela...
Doris, Luke, and Eric.
Eric is a Jewish name?
a large and loving family.
we assemble that we may collectively mourn...
this good and righteous woman.
this woman...
I did not know this woman.
I cannot accurately describe her attributes...
nor do justice to her dimensions.
she was not a person...
but a whole kind of a person,
the ones that crossed the ocean, that brought with us to America, the villages of Russia and Lithuania,
and how we struggled, and how we fought, for the family. For the Jewish home.
descendents of this immigrant woman...
you do not grow up in America...
you, your children, and their children with the goyish names.
you do not live in America.
no such place exists.
your clay is the clay of some Litvak shtetl.
your air is the air of the steppes...
because she carried that old world on her back...
across the ocean in a boat, and she put it down...
on Grand Concourse Avenue.
or on Flatbush.
you can never make that crossing that she made...
for such great voyages in this world do not anymore exist.
but every day of your lives, the miles, that voyage from that place to this one...
you cross, every day.
you understand me?
in you that journey is hold.
I wish I was an octopus, a fucking octopus.
eight loving arms and all those suckers. Know what I mean?
no. - You want lunch?
no, that's okay.
Ailene, Roy Cohn.
what kind of greeting is that?
I thought we were friends.
this will take a minute. Here, eat a little something.
what is this? Tasty sandwich here?
I already told you, it wasn't a vacation, it was business.
I have clients in Haiti.
listen, Ailene, you think I'm the only lawyer in history who ever missed a court date? Don't make such a big fuck...
hold.
you hag.
lf this is a bad time - No, it's a good time.
baby doll. Fuck, wait.
Hello?
sorry to keep you holding, Judge Hollins, I just...
Mrs. Hollins? - Yeah, it's Mrs, Hollins,
sorry, dear. What a deep voice you got.
you enjoying your visit?
she sounds like a truck driver, he sounds like Kate Smith.
it's very confusing.
Nixon appointed him. All the geeks are Nixon appointees.
how many tickets, dear? Seven?
for what, Cats, 42nd Street, what?
you wouldn't like La Cage, trust me. Trust me, I know.
for God's sake, hold.
baby doll, seven for Cats or something.
anything hard to get. I don't give a fuck what. Neither will they.
you've seen La Cage Aux Folles? - No.
it's the best thing on Broadway, maybe ever.
Yeah, who?
couldn't find her there.
couldn't see her.
at least I didn't see her in there. - She was...
it's all right. I'm gonna take the bus.
what do you mean you're gonna take the bus?
I'll see you there.
how's life in Appeals? How's the judge?
he sends his best. - He's a good man. Loyal.
not the brightest man on the bench, although he has manners...
and a nice head of silver hair. - He gives me a lot of responsibility.
like writing his decisions and signing his name.
he's a nice man. You cover admirably. - Thanks, Roy.
who's this? Well, who the fuck are you?
hold.
so, baby doll, what? - It's gonna be Cats,
cats,
cats; it's about cats. Singing cats. You'll love it.
8: 00. Theater's always at 8: 00.
fucking tourists.
eat already, Joe. For Christ's sake, live a little.
Roy, could you... - Yeah, what?
Mrs. Soffer.
Oh, God fucking damn it. - Roy, I really...
baby doll, ring up The Post, Get me Suzy.
Christ! -Roy.
what?
could you please not take the Lord's name in vain?
I'm sorry, but please.
at least while I'm...
right...
sorry, fuck. Only in America.
baby doll, tell them all to fuck off, tell them I died.
so, Joe.
I'm sorry, Roy, it's just that - No, no.
principles count. I respect principles.
I'm not religious, but I like God, God likes me.
baptist, Catholic, what? - Mormon.
Mormon?
delectable. Absolutely.
only in America.
so, Joe, what do you think?
it's a... - It's a crazy life.
chaotic. - God bless chaos, though, right?
Mormons?
I knew Mormons in Nevada.
utah, mostly. - No, these Mormons were in Vegas.
how would you like to go to Washington and work for the Justice Department?
sorry? - How would you like to go to Washington...
work for the Justice Department.
all I got to do is pick up the phone, talk to Ed, and you're in.
in what, exactly?
associate, Assistant, something big.
internal Affairs, heart of the woods, something nice, with clout.
ed - Meese, Attorney General.
all I gotta do is pick up the phone. - But I have to think.
okay, great time to be in Washington, Joe. - Roy.
it's incredibly
it means something to me, too, you understand.
I can't say how much I appreciate this, Roy. I'm sort of stunned.
Thanks, but I have to give it some thought. I have to ask my wife.
your wife, of course. - But I really appreciate it.
of course. Talk to your wife.
to deep-throat a man, to give him intense pleasure, a woman can simply lick the penis, without actually putting the whole organ in her mouth, and still provide the man with a lot of pleasure,
when women tell me that they have a problem with fellatio,
I often tell them to think of the penis as an ice cream cone,
scientists say the hole in the ozone layer high above the Antarctic, is now a record at 7 million square miles,
that's three times the size of the whole of the United States,
the hole appears as a giant blue blob totally covering Antarctica, stretching out to the southern tip of South America,
scientists say that with the hole so big this early in the year, it could be set to grow even bigger,
I wish I could go traveling.
things aren't right with me.
cash, check, or credit card?
you startled me. - Cash, check...
I remember you. You're from Salt Lake.
you sold us the plane tickets when we flew here.
what are you doing in Brooklyn? - You said you wanted to travel.
how thoughtful!
Mr. Lies...
of the International Order of Travel Agents.
we mobilize the globe. We set people adrift.
we are adepts of motion, acolytes of the flocks,
cash, check, or credit card, name your destination.
antarctica maybe? I want to see the hole in the ozone.
I heard on the radio - We'll arrange a guided tour.
now? - Soon, maybe soon.
I'm not safe here, you see.
weird stuff happens.
like? - Like you, for instance.
just appearing. Or last week.
never mind.
people are like planets, you need a thick skin.
Joe stays away, and now look, my dreams are talking back to me.
the price of rootlessness, motion sickness.
only cure, keep moving. - I'm undecided.
I feel that something's going to give. It's 1985...
fifteen years to the third millennium.
maybe Christ will come again...
or maybe the troubles will come and the end will come.
the sky will collapse and there'll be terrible rain...
and showers of poison light...
or maybe my life is really fine...
maybe Joe loves me and I'm only crazy thinking otherwise.
or maybe not.
maybe it's even worse than I know.
maybe I want to know, maybe I don't.
the suspense, Mr. Lies, it's killing me.
I suggest a vacation.
that was the elevator. Oh, God, I should fix myself a...
you have to go. You shouldn't be here. You aren't even real.
call me when you decide. - Go.
Hey, buddy.
you're early.
I was just walking...
and I guess I came home.
are you... - Yeah, I'm a little anxious.
buddy kiss.
nothing to get anxious about.
how would you like to move to Washington?
Washington?
she was pretty crazy.
she was up there in that home for ten years, talking to herself.
I never visited.
she looked too much like my mother.
poor Louis, I'm sorry your grandma's dead.
tiny little coffin.
I'm sorry I didn't introduce you.
I always get so closety at these family things.
you're getting butch.
Hey, Cousin Doris, you don't remember me, I'm Lou.
Rachel's boy, Lou.
not Louis, cause if you say Louis, they'll hear the sibilant "s.
I don't have a sibilant "s." - I don't blame you hiding.
bloodlines. Jewish curses are the worst.
I personally would dissolve if anyone ever looks me in the eye and said, "Feh.
fortunately, Wasps don't say, "Feh..."
and by the way, darling...
cousin Doris is a dyke.
No! Really?
you don't notice anything.
if I hadn't spent the last four years fellating you...
I'd swear you were straight.
you're in a pissy mood. Cat still missing?
not a fur ball in sight. It's your fault. - It is?
I warned you, Louis, names are important.
call an animal Little Sheba, you can't expect it to stick around.
besides, that's a dog's name. - I wanted a dog in the first place, not a cat.
he sprayed my books. - He was a female cat.
cats are stupid high-strung predators. Babylonians sealed them up in bricks.
dogs have brains. - Cats have intuition.
a sharp dog is as smart as a really dull 2-year-old child.
cats know when something's wrong. - Only if you stop feeding them.
they know. That's why Sheba left. She knew.
knew what?
I did my best Shirley Booth this morning.
floppy slippers, housecoat, curlers, can of Little Friskies.
come back, Little Sheba...
come back.
to no avail.
see?
that's just a burst blood vessel.
not according to the best medical authorities.
what? Tell me.
chaos, baby. Lesion number one.
the wine-dark kiss of the angel of death.
Oh, please.
I'm a lesionnaire. Foreign lesion.
the American lesion.
Lesionnaire's disease. - Stop.
my troubles are lesions. - Will you stop?
don't you think I'm handling this well?
I'm gonna die. - Bullshit.
let go of my arm. Let go. - No.
no.
I can't find a way to spare you, baby.
no wall like the wall of hard scientific fact.
chaos, wham.
bang your head on that. - Fuck you.
now that's what I like to hear, a mature reaction.
let's go see if the cat's come home.
Louis.
when did you find this?
I couldn't tell you. - Why?
I was scared, Lou. - Of what?
that you'll leave me.
bad timing, funeral and all, but...
I figured since we're on the subject of death...
here's the bus. I have to go bury my grandma.
Lou...
then you'll come home? - Then I'll come home.
Washington.
it's an incredible honor - I have to think.
of course. - Say no.
you said you were gonna think about it. - I don't wanna move to Washington.
well, I do.
it's a giant cemetery. Huge white graves. Mausoleums everywhere.
we could live in Maryland or Georgetown.
we're happy here. - That's not really true, buddy.
happy enough, pretend happy, it's better than nothing.
it's time we make some changes, Harper. - No changes. Why?
I've been chief clerk for four years.
I make $29, 000 a year. That's ridiculous.
I graduated fourth in my class, I make less than anyone I know.
I'm tired of being a clerk.
I wanna go where something good is happening.
nothing good happens in Washington.
we'll forget Church teachings...
and buy furniture at Conran's...
and become yuppies.
I have too much to do here. - Like what?
I do have things. - What things?
I have to finish painting the bedroom.
you've been painting in there for over a year.
I know, it just isn't done, because I never get time to finish it.
that doesn't make sense.
you have all the time in the world.
you could finish it when I'm at work. - I'm afraid to go in there alone.
afraid of what? - I heard something in there.
metal scraping on the wall, a man with a knife, maybe.
there's no one in the bedroom.
not now. - Not this morning, either.
how do you know? You were at work this morning.
there's something creepy about this place. Remember Rosemary's Baby?
ROSEMARY'S Baby? - Our apartment looks like that one.
wasn't that apartment in Brooklyn? - No.
well, it looked like this.
lt did. - Then let's move.
Georgetown is worse. The Exorcist was in Georgetown.
the devil everywhere you turn, buddy? - Yeah, everywhere.
how many pills today, buddy?
none.
one.
three, only three.
thank you, that was a lovely...
my grandma, just buried.
why are there just two little wooden pegs holding the lid down?
so that she can get out easier if she wants to.
I hope she stays put.
I pretended for years that she was already dead.
when they called to say she had died, it was a surprise. I had abandoned her.
I don't speak Yiddish.
sharper than the serpent's tooth is an ungrateful child.
Shakespeare.
king Lear,
rabbi, what does the Holy Writ say about someone who abandons someone he loves at a time of great need?
why would a person do such a thing?
because he has to.
maybe this person can't...
incorporate sickness into his sense of how things are supposed to go.
maybe vomit and sores and disease really frighten him.
maybe he isn't so good with death.
the Holy Scripture has nothing to say about such a person.
rabbi, I'm afraid of the crimes I may commit.
please, Mister, I'm a sick old rabbi...
facing a long drive home to the Bronx.
you want to confess, better you should find a priest.
I'm not a Catholic, I'm a Jew.
worse luck for you, bubeleh,
catholics believe in forgiveness. Jews believe in guilt.
Thanks.
you just make sure those pegs are in good and tight.
don't worry, Mister, the life she had, she'll stay put.
she's better off.
look...
I know this is scary for you, but try to understand what it means to me.
will you try? - Yes.
good. Really try.
things are starting to change in the world.
I don't wanna - Wait. For the good.
change for the good.
america has rediscovered itself.
its sacred position among nations.
people aren't ashamed of it like they used to be.
this is a great thing. The truth restored, law restored.
that's what President Reagan's done, Harper.
he says truth exists and can be spoken proudly...
and the country responds to him.
we become better, more good.
I need to be a part of that. I need something big to lift me up.
six years ago, the world seemed in decline...
horrible, hopeless, full of unsolvable problems...
and crime, confusion, hunger...
but it still seems that way, more now than before.
you see the ozone layer...
today out the window on Atlantic Avenue...
there was this schizophrenic traffic cop who was making
will you stop it? I'm trying to make a point.
so am l. - You aren't even making sense.
my point is the world seems just
it only seems that way to you because you never go out...
and you have emotional problems.
I do so get out in the world. - No, you don't.
you stay in all day fretting about imaginary
I get out.
I do. You don't know what I do.
you don't stay in all day? - No.
Yes, you do. - That's what you think.
where do you go? - Where do you go when you walk?
and I do not have emotional problems. - I'm sorry.
if I do have emotional problems, it's from living with you or
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
then you should have never married me. You have all these...
secrets and lies.
I want to be married to you, Harper. - You shouldn't. You never should...
Hey, buddy.
buddy kiss.
I heard on the radio how to give a blow job.
what? - Do you want to try?
you shouldn't listen to such - Mormons can give blow jobs.
it was a little Jewish lady with a German accent.
now is a good time for me to make a baby.
then they went on to a program about holes in the ozone layer over Antarctica.
skin burns...
birds go blind...
icebergs melt.
the world's coming to an end.
morning. - Good morning, Counselor.
sorry, I don't know your name.
don't bother. A word processor, the lowest of the low.
Joe Pitt, I'm with Justice Wilson. - I know that.
counselor Pitt, Chief Clerk.
are you okay? - Yes, thanks.
what a nice man.
not so nice. - What?
not so nice. Nothing.
what's wrong?
life just sucks shit. - I'm sorry?
forget it.
thanks for asking.
I mean, it really is nice of you.
sorry. Sick friend. - I'm sorry.
that's sweet.
three of your colleagues have preceded you to this baleful sight...
and you're the first one to ask.
the others just opened the door, saw me, and fled.
I hope they had to pee real bad.
they just didn't want to intrude.
Reaganite, heartless, macho, asshole lawyers.
that's unfair.
what is? Heartless, macho, Reaganite...
lawyer?
I voted for Reagan. - You did?
twice. - Twice!
well, oh, boy, a gay Republican. - Excuse me?
nothing.
I'm not... No, forget it.
republican, not Republican?
what?
what? - Not gay. I'm not gay.
sorry.
it's just that...
yes?
sometimes you can tell from the way a person sounds.
you sound - No, I don't.
like what? - Like a Republican.
do I sound like a...
what, like a Republican?
or do l?
do you what? - Sound like a
Yeah, like a...
I'm confused. - Yes.
my name is Louis, but all my friends call me Louise.
I work in word processing. Thanks for the toilet paper.
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. De Mille.
one wants to move through life with elegance and grace.
blossoming infrequently, but with exquisite taste...
and perfect timing.
like a rare bloom...
a zebra orchid.
one wants...
but one so seldom gets what one wants.
does one?
no.
one does not.
one gets fucked over.
one dies at 30.
robbed of decades of majesty
I look like a corpse.
a corpse-ette.
my queen!
you know you've hit rock bottom when even drag is a drag.
who are you?
who are you?
what are you doing in my hallucination?
I'm not in your hallucination. You're in my dream.
you're wearing makeup.
so are you. - But you're a man.
my hands and feet give it away.
there must be some mistake here. I don't recognize you.
are you my...
some sort of imaginary friend? - No.
aren't you too old to have imaginary friends?
I have emotional problems, I took too many pills.
why are you wearing makeup?
I was in the process of applying the face, trying to make myself feel better.
I swiped the new fall colors at the Clinique counter at Macy's.
you stole these?
I was out of cash, it was an emotional emergency.
Joe will be so angry. I promised him no more pills.
these pills you keep alluding to...
valium, I take Valium. Lots of Valium.
and you're dancing as fast as you can.
I'm not addicted. I don't believe in addiction and l...
I never drink and I never take drugs. - Smell you, Nancy Drew.
except for Valium. - Except Valium in wee fistfuls.
it's terrible. Mormons are not supposed to be addicted to anything.
I'm a Mormon. - I'm a homosexual.
in my church, we don't believe in homosexuals.
in my church, we don't believe in Mormons.
what church do...
I get it.
I don't understand this.
if I didn't ever see you before...
and I don't think I did, then I don't think you should be here...
in this hallucination...
because in my experience, the mind, which is where hallucinations come from...
shouldn't be able to make up anything that wasn't there to start with that didn't enter it from experience from the real world.
imagination can't create anything new, can it?
it only recycles bits and pieces from the world...
and reassembles them into visions. Am I making sense right now?
given the circumstances, yes.
when we think we've escaped the unbearable ordinariness...
and untruthfulness of our lives...
it's really only the same old ordinariness and falseness rearranged into the appearance of novelty and truth.
nothing unknown is knowable.
don't you think it's depressing?
the limitations of the imagination? - Yes.
it's something you learn after your second theme party.
it's all been done before.
the world, finite...
terribly...
this is the most depressing hallucination I ever had.
apologies. I do try to be amusing.
don't apologize, you...
I can't expect someone who's really sick to entertain me.
how on earth did you know? - That happens.
this is the very threshold of revelations sometimes. You can see things.
how sick you are.
do you see anything about me?
Yes. - What?
you are amazingly unhappy. - Big deal.
you meet a Valium addict, you figure out she's unhappy...
that doesn't count. Of course... Something else?
something surprising?
something surprising? - Yes.
your husband's a homo.
ridiculous.
Really? - Threshold of revelation.
I don't like your revelations. I don't think you intuit well at all.
Joe's a very normal man.
Oh, God!
do homos take, like, lots of long walks?
Yes, we do. In stretch pants with lavender coifs.
I just looked at you and there was - A sort of blue streak of recognition.
Yes. - Like you knew me incredibly well.
Yes. - Yes.
I have to go now, get back, something just...
fell apart.
Oh, God!
I feel so sad.
I'm sorry.
I usually say fuck the truth.
but mostly the truth fucks you.
I see something else about you.
deep inside you, there's a part of you...
the most inner part...
entirely free of disease.
I can see that.
is that...
that isn't true.
threshold of revelation.
people come and go so strangely here.
I don't think there is any uninfected part of me.
my heart is pumping polluted blood.
I feel dirty.
look up,
Hello?
look up!
who is that?
look up, prepare the way.
I don't see any
prepare for the parting of the air, the breath, the ascent,
glory to
what the fuck.
Hello!
is that it?
Hello!
poor me.
poor, poor me. Why me?
why poor, poor me?
I don't feel good right now. I really don't.
Harper?
where were you?
where were you? - Out.
where? - Just out, thinking.
it's late.
I had a lot to think about. - I burned dinner.
I'm sorry.
not my dinner. My dinner was fine. Your dinner.
I put it back in the oven and turned everything as high as it can go...
and I watched till it burned black.
it's still hot, very hot, want it?
you didn't have to do that.
I know. It just seemed like the kind of thing...
a mentally deranged, sex-starved, pill-popping housewife would do.
so I did it. Who knows anymore what I have to do?
how many pills? - A bunch. Don't change the subject.
I won't talk to you. - No, don't do that. I'm fine.
pills are not the problem, not our problem.
I wanna know where you've been, and I wanna know what's going on.
going on with what? The job? - Not the job.
I said I needed more time.
I talked to Mr. Cohn on the phone, he said that I had to hurry.
but I can't get you to talk sensibly about - Shut up!
stick to the subject! -I don't know what that is!
you have something you wanna ask me, ask me.
ask me. Go.
I can't. I'm scared of you.
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.
tell me without making me ask, please.
this is crazy. I'm not...
when you come through the door...
your face is never exactly the way I remembered it.
I get surprised by something mean and hard about the way you look...
even the weight of you in the bed at night...
the way you breathe in your sleep...
seems unfamiliar. You terrify me.
I know who you are.
Yes, I'm the enemy. That's easy. That doesn't change.
you think you're the only who hates sex? I do. I hate it with you.
I dream that you batter away at me till my joints come apart like wax...
and I fall into pieces. It's like a punishment.
it was wrong of me to marry you. I knew...
it's a sin and it's killing us both.
I can always tell you've taken pills because it makes you red-faced and sweaty.
and frankly, that's very often why I don't want to...
because... - Because you aren't pretty.
not like this.
I have something I wanna ask - Then ask! What the hell are you
are you a homo?
are you?
you try to walk out right now...
I'll put your dinner back in the oven and turn it up so high...
the building will fill with smoke, and everyone in it will asphyxiate.
so help me God, I will. Now answer the question.
what if l... - Then tell me, please, and we'll see.
no.
I'm not.
I don't see what difference it makes.
jews don't have any clear textual guide to the afterlife.
I mean even that it exists.
I don't think much about it.
I see it as a perpetual rainy Thursday afternoon in March...
dead leaves...
very Greco-Roman.
for us, it's not the verdict that counts, it's the act of judgment.
that's why I can never be a lawyer. In court, all that matters is the verdict.
you can never be a lawyer because you're oversexed.
and too distracted.
not distracted, abstracted.
I'm trying to make a point. - Namely?
the shaping of the law, not its execution.
the point, dear, the point.
that it should be the questions and shape of a life...
its total complexity, gathered, arranged, and considered...
which matters in the end.
not some stamp of salvation or damnation...
which disperses all the complexity in some unsatisfying little decision.
the balancing of the scales - I like this.
very Zen.
it's reassuringly incomprehensible and useless.
we, who are about to die, thank you.
you are not about to die.
it's not going well, really.
two new lesions...
my leg hurts, there's protein in my urine, the doctor says...
but who know what the fuck that portends.
anyway it shouldn't be there. The protein.
my butt is chapped from diarrhea.
and yesterday I shat blood.
I really hate this.
you don't tell me - You get too upset.
I wind up comforting you.
it's easier. - Oh, thanks.
if it's bad, I'll tell you.
shitting blood sounds bad to me.
I'm telling you - And I'm handling it.
tell me some more about justice.
I am handling it.
well, Louis, you win trooper of the month.
I take it back. You aren't trooper of the month.
this isn't working.
tell me some more about justice.
you are not about to die.
justice... - ls an immensity, it's confusing.
vastness, justice is God.
prior.
you love me?
Yes.
what if I walked out on this?
would you hate me forever?
Yes.
I think we ought to pray.
ask God for help.
ask him together.
God won't talk to me.
I have to make up people to talk to me. - You have to keep asking.
I forgot the question.
Oh, yeah. God, is my husband a homo? - Stop it!
I'm warning you!
does it make any difference that I might be one thing deep within?
no matter how wrong or ugly that thing is...
so long as I have fought with everything I have to kill it?
what do you want from me?
what do you want from me, Harper, more than that?
for God's sake, there's nothing left.
I'm a shell. There's nothing left to kill.
as long as my behavior is what I know it has to be, decent, correct...
that alone in the eyes of God...
no, not that. That's Utah talk, Mormon talk. I hate it, Joe.
tell me, say it.
all I will say is that I'm a very good man...
who has worked very hard to become good...
and you wanna destroy that.
you wanna destroy me but I am not gonna let you do that.
I'm gonna have a baby.
liar. - You liar.
a baby born addicted to pills.
a baby who does not dream, but who hallucinates...
who stares up at us with big mirror eyes...
and who does not know who we are.
are you really? - No.
Yes.
no. Yes.
get away from me.
now we both have a secret.
nobody knows what causes it.
and nobody knows how to cure it.
the best theory is that we blame a retrovirus.
the human immunodeficiency virus.
its presence is made known to us by the useless antibodies...
which appear in reaction to its entrance into the bloodstream through a cut or an orifice.
the antibodies are powerless to protect the body against it.
Why? We don't know,
the body's immune system ceases to function,
sometimes the body even attacks itself,
at any rate, it's left open to a whole horror house of infections from microbes it usually defends against.
like Kaposi's sarcomas...
those lesions on your arms, or your throat problem.
or the glands.
we think it may also be able to slip past the blood-brain barrier into the brain.
which is, of course, very bad news.
it's fatal in we don't know what percent of people with suppressed immune responses.
very interesting...
Mr. Wizard.
why the fuck are you telling me this?
well, I have just removed one of three lesions...
which biopsy results will probably tell us is a Kaposi's sarcoma lesion.
and you have a pronounced swelling of glands...
in your neck, groin, and armpits.
lymphadenopathy is another sign.
and you have oral candidiasis.
and maybe a little more fungus under the fingernails of two digits on your right hand.
so?
that's why I'm...
this disease... - Syndrome.
whatever.
it afflicts mostly homosexuals and drug addicts.
mostly.
hemophiliacs are also at risk.
homosexuals and drug addicts.
so why are you implying that l...
what are you implying, Henry?
I don't think I was implying anything. - I'm not a drug addict.
come on, Roy. - What? "Come on, Roy" what?
you think I'm a junkie, Henry?
do you see tracks?
this is absurd.
so say it.
say what?
say, "Roy Cohn, you are a...
Roy. - "You are a..." Go on.
not, "Roy Cohn, you are a drug fiend."
Roy Marcus Cohn, you are a...
go on, Henry, it starts with an "H.
I'm not gonna get into - With an "H," Henry...
and it isn't "hemophiliac."
come on!
why are you doing this, Roy? - No, I mean it. Say it.
say, "Roy Cohn, you are a homosexual."
and I will proceed systematically to destroy your reputation.
and your practice.
and your career in the state of New York, Henry.
which you know I can do.
you have been seeing me since 1958.
apart from the face lifts, I have treated you for everything from syphilis
from a whore in Dallas.
...from syphilis to venereal warts in your rectum...
which you may have gotten from a whore in Dallas.
but it wasn't a female whore.
so say it.
Roy Cohn, you are...
you have had sex with men. Many, many times, Roy.
and one of those men or any number of them has made you very sick.
you have AlDS.
ALDS?
you know, your problem, Henry, is that you are hung up on words, on labels...
that you believe they mean what they seem to mean.
ALDS, homosexual, gay, lesbian.
you think these are names that tell you who someone sleeps with?
they don't tell you that. - No?
no.
like all labels, they tell you one thing and one thing only.
where does an individual so identified fit in the food chain...
in the pecking order?
not an ideology or a sexual taste, but something much simpler:
clout.
not who I fuck or who fucks me...
but who will pick up the phone when I call.
who owes me favors.
this is what a label refers to.
now, to someone who does not understand this...
homosexual is what I am because I have sex with men.
but really, this is wrong.
homosexuals are not men who sleep with other men.
homosexuals are men, who, in 15 years of trying cannot pass a pissant anti-discrimination bill through city council.
homosexuals are men who know nobody and who nobody knows.
who have zero clout.
does this sound like me, Henry?
no. - No!
I have clout. Lots.
I pick up this phone, I punch 15 numbers, you know who's on the other end?
ln under five minutes, Henry. - The President.
better, Henry. His wife.
I'm impressed.
I don't want you to be impressed. I want you to understand.
this is not sophistry and this is not hypocrisy.
this is reality.
I have sex with men...
but unlike nearly every other man of whom this is true...
I bring the guy I'm screwing to the White House.
and President Reagan smiles at us and shakes his hand...
because what I am is defined entirely by who I am.
Roy Cohn is not a homosexual.
Roy Cohn is a heterosexual man, Henry who fucks around with guys.
okay, Roy.
and what is my diagnosis, Henry?
you have AlDS, Roy. - No. Henry, no.
ALDS is what homosexuals have.
I have liver cancer.
whatever the fuck you have...
it's very serious.
and I haven't got a damn thing for you.
the NlH in Bethesda has a new drug called...
AZT...
with a two-year waiting list that not even I can get you onto.
so pick up the phone, Roy...
and dial the 15 numbers...
and tell the First Lady that you need it on an experimental treatment for liver cancer...
because you can call it any damn thing you want, Roy.
but what it boils down to is very bad news.
Louis.
please wake up.
Oh, God!
please wake up.
what?
what? What is it?
something horrible is wrong with me. I can't breathe.
I'm calling the ambulance. - No, wait.
wait? Are you fucking crazy? God, you're on fire, your head is on fire.
lt hurts. - I'll call an ambulance.
no, I don't wanna go to the hospital. I don't. Please let me lie here.
no. Prior, stand up! - Don't touch my leg.
we have to... God, this is so crazy! - I'll be okay if I could just lie here a little.
really, if I could just sleep a little.
Louis, don't.
don't call. You'll send me there and I won't come back.
Yes, yes. It's an emergency. I need an ambulance right away.
please, Louis! - Will you shut the fuck up?
210... - I have to go to the bathroom.
I don't know. I don't know, he can't breathe!
Oh, God!
prior... - I'm sorry.
they'll be here in a minute. It's... Oh, God!
what is that? - I had an accident.
this is blood. - Maybe you shouldn't touch it.
help! Oh, God. God help me! I can't!
why are you sitting in the dark? Turn on the light.
no, I heard the sounds in the bedroom again.
I know someone was in there.
no one was.
maybe actually in the bed, under the covers, with a knife.
Joe, I'm thinking of going away...
by which I mean I think I'm going off again. You know what I mean?
no, please don't. Stay. We can fix it.
I pray for that.
this is my fault, but I can correct it.
you have to try, too.
when you pray, what do you pray for?
I pray for God to crush me...
break me up into little pieces and start all over again.
please don't pray for that.
I had a book of Bible stories when I was a kid...
and there was this picture I'd look at 20 times every day:
jacob wrestles with the angel.
I don't really remember the story or why they're wrestling.
just the picture.
jacob is young, and very strong, and the angel is a beautiful man, with golden hair and wings, of course.
I still dream about it.
many nights.
and...
it's me in that struggle.
fierce and unfair.
the angel's not human and holds nothing back.
so how could anyone human win? What kind of a fight is that? It's not just.
soul thrown down in the dust...
your heart torn out from God's...
but you can't not lose.
in the whole entire world...
you are the only person...
the only person I love or have ever loved.
I love you terribly.
terribly.
that's what's so awfully, irreducibly real.
I can make up anything, but I can't dream that away.
are you really gonna have a baby?
it's my time and there's no blood.
I don't really know. I suppose it wouldn't be a great thing.
maybe I'm just not bleeding 'cause I take too many pills.
maybe I'll give birth to a pill.
that would give a new meaning to pill-popping.
I think you should go to Washington alone.
change, like you said. - I'm not gonna leave you, Harper.
maybe not...
but I'm gonna leave you.
he'll be all right now. - No, he won't.
no, I guess not.
I gave him something that makes him sleep. - Deep asleep?
orbiting the moons of Jupiter.
it's a good place to be. - Any place better than here.
you his... - Yes.
I'm his...
this must be hell for you. - lt is.
hell, the afterlife which is not at all like a rainy afternoon in March, by the way, Prior.
it's a lot more vivid than I'd expected. Dead leaves...
the kind of dying feeling that breaks your heart.
Yeah, we all get to break our hearts on this one.
he seems like a nice guy.
he's cute. - Not like this.
Yes, he is. Was, whatever.
it's a weird name, Prior Walter. Like the Walter before this one.
lots of Walters before this one.
prior's an old, old family name in an old, old family.
Walters go back to the Mayflower and beyond back to the Norman conquest.
he says there's a Prior Walter stitched into the Bayeux Tapestry.
is that impressive?
it's old, very old, which in some circles equals impressive.
not in my circle.
will he sleep through the night? - At least.
I'm going.
tell him...
if he wakes up and you're still on, tell him...
goodbye.
tell him I had to go.
the pills are something she started when she miscarried.
no, she took some before that.
she had a bad time at home when she was a kid.
her home was really bad. I think a lot of drinking and physical stuff.
she doesn't talk about that.
instead, she talks about the sky falling down...
people with knives hiding under sofas, and monsters...
Mormons!
everyone thinks that Mormons don't come from homes like that.
we aren't supposed to behave that way, but we do.
it's not lying or being two-faced.
everyone tries very hard to live up to God's strictures, which are very strict.
I shouldn't be bothering you with this. - No, please, come on, heart-to-heart.
you want another? What is it, what you got? Seltzer?
Yeah.
the failure to measure up hits people very hard.
from such a strong desire to be good...
they feel very far from goodness when they fail.
what scares me is that maybe what I really love in her is the part of her that's farthest from the light, from God's love.
maybe I was drawn to that in the first place...
and I'm keeping it alive because I need it.
why would you need it?
there are things...
I don't know how well we know ourselves. I mean, what if...
I know I married her...
because I loved that she was always wrong, always doing something wrong.
like one step out of step.
in Salt Lake City, that stands out.
I never stood out, on the outside...
but inside, it was hard for me to pass.
pass?
Yeah.
pass as what?
as someone cheerful and strong.
those who love God with an open heart unclouded by secrets and struggles are cheerful.
God's easy, simple love for them shows in how happy they are, the saints.
but you had secrets?
secret, secret struggles?
I wanted to be one of the elect, one of the blessed.
you feel you ought to be, that the blemishes are yours by choice...
which, of course, they aren't.
Harper's sorrow, that really deep sorrow...
she didn't choose that, but it's there.
you didn't put it there? - No.
you sound like you think you did. - I am responsible for her.
because she's your wife.
that, and I do love her.
whatever. She's your wife...
and so, there are obligations to her.
but also to yourself.
God, she'd fall apart in Washington. - Then let her stay here.
she'd fall apart if I leave her. - Then bring her to Washington.
I just can't, Roy. She needs me.
listen, Joe, I'm the best divorce lawyer in the business.
can't Washington wait?
you do what you need to do, Joe. What you need. You.
let her life go where it wants to go.
you'll both be better off for that.
somebody should get what they want.
what do you want?
I want you to fuck me, hurt me and make me bleed.
I want to. - Yeah?
I want to hurt you.
fuck me. - Yeah?
hard. - Yeah, you been a bad boy?
very bad, very bad. - You need to be punished, boy?
Yes, I do. - Yes, what?
Yes, what, boy?
Yes, sir.
I want you to take me to your place, boy.
no, I can't do that. - No what?
no, sir, I can't. I don't live alone, sir.
your lover know you're out with a man tonight?
no sir, he... My lover doesn't know. - Your lover know you like
let's change the subject, okay? Can we go to your place?
I live with my parents.
everyone who makes it in life makes it...
because someone older, more powerful takes an interest.
the most precious asset in life, I think, is the ability to be a good son.
you have that, Joe.
I've had many fathers. I owe my life to them.
powerful, powerful men. Walter Winchell, Edgar Hoover...
Joe McCarthy most of all.
he valued me because I was a good lawyer...
but he loved me because I was, and am, a good son.
he was a very, very difficult man.
very guarded and cagey.
I brought out something tender in him.
I don't know.
he'd have died for me.
and me for him.
does this embarrass you?
I had a hard time with my father.
your father's living? - Dead.
he was what, difficult man?
he was in the military. He could be very unfair...
and cold.
he loved you, though. - I don't know.
no, he loved you, Joe. This I know.
sometimes a father's love has to be very, very hard.
unfair, even.
cold.
make your son grow strong in a world like this.
this isn't a good world.
relax.
not a chance.
l... - What?
I think it broke, the rubber.
you want me to keep going?
pull out? - Keep going, infect me, I don't care.
I'm sorry, but I think I wanna go.
and give my best to Mom and Dad.
it was a joke.
how long...
how long we known each other?
since 1980.
right. That's a long time.
I feel close to you, Joe.
do I advise you well?
you've been an incredible friend, Roy. - I wanna be family.
famiglia, as my ltalian friends call it.
la famiglia,
lovely word.
it's important for me to help you, like I was helped.
I owe practically everything to you, Roy. - I'm dying, Joe. Cancer.
Oh, my God. - Please, let me finish.
few people know this.
I'm telling you this because...
I'm not afraid of death.
what can death bring that I haven't faced?
I've lived.
life is the worst.
listen to me, I'm a philosopher.
Joe, you must do this.
you must, must.
love, that's a trap.
responsibility, that's a trap, too.
like a father to a son, I tell you this.
life is full of horror. Nobody escapes.
nobody. Save yourself.
whatever pulls on you...
whatever needs from you, threatens you.
learn at least this:
what you are capable of...
let nothing stand in your way.
miss thing!
Stella. - Stella for star.
let me see.
you look like shit. Why, yes, indeed you do.
not to despair. Magic goop.
what kind of crap is that?
beats me. Let's rub it on your poor blistered body and see what it does.
this is not Western medicine.
voodoo cream from the botanica round the block.
and you, a registered nurse.
beeswax and cheap perfume cut with Jergens lotion.
full of good vibes and love from some little black Cubana witch in Miami.
get that trash away from me. I'm immune-suppressed.
I am a health professional. I know what I'm doing.
it stinks.
any word from Louis?
gone.
he'll be back, I know the type. Likes to keep a girl on edge.
it's been...
how long?
I don't remember. - How long have you been here?
I don't remember. I don't give a fuck. I want Louis. I want my fucking boyfriend.
where the fuck is he? I'm dying.
Where's Louis?
this is a very strange drug, this drug.
emotional lability, for starters.
save a tab or two for me. - No, not this drug.
this drug, she is serious, poisonous chemistry.
and not just disorienting.
I hear things.
voices. - Voices?
a voice.
saying what?
I'm not supposed to tell. - You better tell the doctor, or I will.
don't, please. I want the voice. It's wonderful.
it's all that's keeping me alive. I don't wanna talk to some intern about it.
do you know what happens when I hear it?
what? - I get hard.
Oh, my!
and you know I am slow to rise. - My jaw aches at the memory.
and would you deny me this little solace?
betray my concupiscence to Florence Nightingale's storm troopers?
perish the thought, ma bebe,
they'd change the drug, just to spoil the fun.
you and your boner can depend on me.
all this girl-talk shit is politically incorrect, you know.
we should have dropped it back when we gave up drag.
I'm sick. I get to be politically incorrect if it makes me feel better.
you sound like Lou.
at least I have the satisfaction of knowing he's in anguish somewhere.
I have to go.
if I wanna spend my whole lonely life looking after white people...
I can get underpaid to do it.
you're just a Christian martyr.
don't go crazy on me, girlfriend.
I already got enough crazy queens for one lifetime.
for two.
I can't be bothering with dementia.
I promise.
Ouch.
Ouch, indeed.
why'd they have to pick on you?
and eat more, girlfriend. You really do look like shit.
are you still here?
I can't stay.
I will return,
are you one of those follow-me-to-the-other-side voices?
no,
I am no nightbird,
I am a messenger,
you have a beautiful voice.
stay with me?
not now, Soon I will return,
I will reveal myself to you,
I am glorious,
glorious,
you must prepare, - For what? I don't - No death, No,
a marvelous work and a wonder we undertake, an edifice awry we straighten, a great lie we abolish,
a great error, correct, with the rule, sword, and broom of truth!
I am on my way.
when I am manifest, our work begins,
prepare for the parting of the air,
the breath, the ascent,
glory to
what?
it's a revolution in Washington, Joe.
we have a new agenda, and finally, a real leader.
they got back the Senate but we have the courts.
by the '90s...
the Supreme Court will be solid Republican appointees...
and the federal bench, Republican judges like landmines everywhere.
everywhere they turn. Affirmative action?
take it to court. Boom! Landmine.
Roy, are you feeling...
no, I'm fine.
we'll get our way in everything.
abortion, defense, Central America, family values, a live investment climate.
we have the White House locked till 2000 and beyond.
a permanent fix on the Oval Office? It's possible.
it's really the end of liberalism, Joe. The end of New Deal socialism.
the end of ipso facto secular humanism.
the dawning of a genuinely American political personality...
modeled on Ronald Wilson Reagan.
lt sounds great, Mr. Heller. - Martin.
and justice is the hub. Especially since Ed Meese took over.
he doesn't specialize in legal fine points. He's a flatfoot. Cop!
he reminds me of Teddy Roosevelt. - I can't wait to meet him.
too bad, Joe. He's been dead for 60 years.
Martin? - Yes, Roy.
rub my back.
Roy. - No, no, I mean it, a sore spot.
I get them all the time now. Please, rub it for me, darling.
do that for me?
right there.
Yeah, right there. Yes, a little lower.
how do you think a handful of Bolsheviks turned St. Petersburg into Leningrad in one afternoon?
comrades. Who do for each other.
marx and Engels, Lenin and Trotsky...
joseph Stalin and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
comrades, right, Martin?
this man, Joe, is a saint of the right.
I know, Mr. Heller. - See what I mean?
he's special. Isn't he? - Don't embarrass him, Roy.
gravity, decency, smarts.
his strength is as the strength of 10 because his heart is pure.
and he's a Roy-boy, 100%. - We're on the move, Joe, on the move.
Mr. Heller, I'd really - We can't wait any longer for an answer.
Joe's a married man, Martin.
with a wife.
she does not care to go to D. C. and so Joe cannot go.
keeps us dangling.
we've seen that before, haven't we?
these men and their wives? - Yes, beware.
I really can't discuss this - Then don't discuss. Say yes, Joe.
now. - Say, "Yes, I will."
now.
now I'm gonna hold my breath till you do.
I'm turning blue waiting. Now, God damn it!
Roy, calm down. - Here. Fuck it.
came today, read.
Roy, this...
Roy, this is terrible.
you're telling me.
new York State Bar Association, Martin, they're gonna try and disbar me.
Oh, my. - Why?
why, Martin? - Revenge.
the whole establishment. Their little rules, because I know no rules.
because I don't see the law as a dead and arbitrary collection of antiquated dictums. "Thou shall, thou shall not."
because I know the law is a pliable, breathing, sweating organ.
because, because...
because he borrowed $500, 000 from one of his clients.
there's that. - And he forgot to return it.
Roy, that's...
you borrowed money from a client?
I'm deeply ashamed.
Roy, you know how much I admire you. I know you have your unorthodox ways...
a restored film
angels OF SIN
this film was inspired by a French Dominican congregation founded in 1867 by Father Lataste.
the authors are responsible for the story they created, yet also tried to convey, by means of images and details taken from reality, the atmosphere of these convents, and the spirit of their mission.
ave Maria.
we'll have the tall, devoted driver I asked for?
good. Have him wait.
you're excused, you're sick.
please, I'm better. I had to stay in last time.
that's why it didn't work. - Then come. You'll bring us luck.
I made a sketch so we don't make the same mistake as last time.
mother Subprioress will wait in a taxi on the corner.
Yes, Mother.
mother Mistress and I will go to the door.
bring a flashlight, it'll be dark.
Yes, Mother.
if it works, we head for the car.
if there's trouble, we head this way.
mother Mistress's signal will be 3 flashes.
then come meet us this way.
don't worry, Mother St John.
edouard's driving. He's a former boxer.
I ask the community to pray while we're gone, even all night, so as to ensure our success.
inmate 42-16 is here, Mother. She's waiting.
Agnes!
mother, thank you for coming!
ready to follow us?
I've waited all month!
you have your release papers? - Here.
mother...
I know. Someone asked about you, wrote to you.
the letter begged me, threatened me.
don't shake, dear. Have no fear.
anything suspect? - The guard saw prowlers...
wait till his next round.
no, we don't have time. Come, Agnes.
mother, it's him!
I'm Anne-Marie. - Mother Prioress is waiting.
you know the life you'll have here?
a wonderful life, with my outcast sisters.
Yes, sisters in misery.
we welcome those freed from prison.
sins and misfortunes are divine guarantees.
you're from a gentler background, and this is a hard legion.
I must ensure you're up to it. Are you happy?
very. - Healthy?
enough for the world I left.
you bid it farewell? - To an old couple on the train.
and a dog that resembled mine.
I'm ready.
the rehabilitated nuns have the same rights, commitments and religious honor as you.
you agree to live among them, leading the same life, being seen as one of them?
that's why I'm here.
then you're welcome.
so gloomy, Mother St John?
you light up when you like novices.
I won't light up, as you say, today, Mother.
let's hope you do in 2 weeks when she dons her habit with Agnes.
are you ready?
does it suit me?
it does. Look at my face to be sure.
here, our only mirror is another Sister's eyes.
I'm so silly!
mother Dominique!
hurry, they're waiting for us.
mother Dominique, I can't see myself!
what do you ask for?
for God's mercy, and yours.
stand up.
God's mercy is not ours to give, but your gesture leads us to believe you have it.
as for ours, we give it freely.
you have a year to experience our life.
if you don't like it, or we dislike your behavior, you're free to go as we're free to send you away.
approach and join our family.
what should I give you? - Make a sacrifice.
I've only won'thless mementos.
that's why you must give them away.
this belt can replace Sister Marthe's.
give the pen to Sister Beatrice, our secretary.
I've also a gold pencil. For you.
what about these books, letters and photos?
they won't please anyone. Let me keep them.
girls we take from prison keep nothing.
be an example.
just a few days. - As you wish.
when your whole world is your papers, they weigh heavily.
what's wrong? - My mirror's gone, Mother!
it was right here...
it's going around the convent. It's not important.
my chain and pencil are gone, too!
they couldn't have been stolen?
they merely took a special path to Mother Prioress.
stand up.
forgive me for the pain I caused!
but I've been 5 years without a mirror.
who did you see in it?
a thief masquerading as Sister Agnes.
I also stole this chain and pencil.
forgive me. - Go in peace.
if you'll fight against your bad habits, you may stay.
don't be so good to me, I need your severity.
yours is sufficient for today.
mother Prioress kept the mirror. Here's the rest.
they are no longer mine. Give them away.
why did you come here, Sister?
to see you. - We're not interesting.
to see the most miserable of you.
I've a brother, always wanted a sister to have poverty as the family I lack.
it's not a family, it's a sickness. Like leprosy.
to embrace lepers, you need great courage.
or great pride.
some Sisters here think you're proud.
if pride is thinking I was chosen to win over the guiltiest or the most stubborn here, I am.
an angel couldn't win some of them over.
they're those I wish to meet.
I long to go on prison visits with Mother Prioress.
your jail held bad criminals?
it's not those who committed the worst crimes who resist.
there are others. - You had them?
one. Who even we were afraid of.
she was clever and fought hard.
her beauty was twisted by hate.
why was she there? - She was convicted of theft.
what did she tell the Sisters? - Nothing.
what's her name? - Thérèse.
what was that?
we said we have no Sister Thérèse, we need one.
is she still in jail?
her 2 years are almost up.
I beg a favor, Mother.
Yes, my Daughter?
to accompany Mother Prioress to the prison.
you're new. This is unusual. Why?
I feel I'm being called. - Your mission is here.
I must go. Before it's too late.
go to our Founder's grave, Sister.
he'll tell you to seek our peace.
I went. He urged me to do this. - Sister!
forgive me, Mother. - Go.
she's the opposite of what we need. An agitated soul...
but a soul, nonetheless.
we like your daughter, ma'am. - Who wouldn't?
imagine how hard it is to be separated from her.
if she were happy, I'd bow out.
but this convent... I came for her.
you'll see her.
Anne-Marie loves beauty, luxury, cleanliness.
how could she be happy amongst criminals?
I can't imagine being with one.
yet it's easy, ma'am. I'm one of them.
I'm sorry.
we like Anne-Marie, but I'm not holding her.
nor any who haven't taken their vows.
I count my flock each night with anguish.
they're all there.
we'll miss Anne-Marie if she leaves, but we'll abide by that.
thank you. - For what?
saying you were a criminal.
maybe it's bad. It might have been vanity.
Anne-Marie!
you're so beautiful, mother!
I'm so lucky you're my mother.
your hair!
not a strand is missing.
darling!
I came for you. - Came for me?
you won't stay another day.
you said I could.
be devoted to God, not criminals. - What's the difference?
darling! Fight misfortune by doing charity work with me.
you'll help the deprived, who deserve you more.
there are murderesses here!
you don't understand.
what's to understand?
you must be sure of yourself to do what you're doing!
do you not know me, either? You think I'm weak?
dear child!
I'm your child, but I'm strong, mother dear.
I didn't leave the world because it was hard, but because there were no challenges.
I came to fight misery, to help people.
I can do that here. I'm happy here.
but sad I cause you pain.
you can't offer God the suffering of others!
forgive me.
what's wrong, Clotilde? You cried?
I wasrt honest...
the convent's not for you?
we'll find you a job.
I long only for the convent.
but I'm in for 20 years!
so?
I'll be 45 in 20 years, it will be too late!
why too late?
powder, Janine?
plaster. Sorry, Mother.
plaster? - From the wall.
it makes you pale, you've no color.
you'll get some with us.
the Council accepted you.
here, if you want. - Perfect.
you could say hello.
here's one who'll never amount to anything.
she's hopeless.
sorry, Sister! She stained your habit!
no matter. - She did it on purpose!
she stains anything white. Just like her!
come on!
why didn't you speak to her, Mother?
she doesn't want me to.
for her, words come from those who command, punish, insult her.
had we spoken, we'd be the same.
she'd have lumped us with the guard.
blame me for the kiss?
no, you didn't speak, either.
go on!
what is it? - 17-21, sir.
her again?
she looks so sad. - Her own fault.
that rebel was transferred here 3 months ago, for us to change her.
nothing worked.
she screams for days and nights.
she's hostile to all the guards.
why does she rebel? - Listen to her!
17-21 is in the hole, Warden. - Good.
she stays until her release. - When?
in 2 weeks. Unless I isolate her, she'll get extra time!
you're Thérèse?
Yes, I know your name. I say it daily.
say it when I'm gone.
Thérèse.
who sent you?
no one. I'm a Sister to everyone here.
not mine! I'm innocent! Go!
the law makes mistakes.
go see your thieves, I stole nothing!
he set me up!
he made me steal and turned me in.
I'm locked up and he's free!
he has 2 more weeks to be happy.
you'll be free. Do you think...
go! You keep me from screaming!
scream if you wish.
it won't keep me from hearing your pain.
there's one remedy: Forgiveness.
I found another. Found it my first day here.
I've planned it. The guilty can forgive, the innocent get revenge!
too bad for him!
why are you here listening to me?
warden send you for my secrets?
what secrets?
sister Elisabeth, you'll choose the texts, as the youngest.
I'm scared.
of what?
of being the chance that gives each sister the text that will be her motto all year?
there is no chance, Sister. Everything is a sign.
sister Gabrielle.
Pascal:
all things are mystery...
funny, the verses are picked by chance, but they always fit.
St Eulalia called them "miraculous."
sister Berthe.
Angelus Silesius:
love, unannounced, soon has God's ear.
intelligence and wit He takes longer to hear.
mother St John.
St Teresa of Avila:
do not obey my orders, obey my silences.
sister Anne-Marie.
St Catherine of Siena:
if you hear God's word joining you to another, "listen to no other words: They are merely its echo."
what's wrong, Sister? Are you ill?
I hear the word. - Which word?
the word from my text.
I already heard it the other day in the prison.
help me speak to you, Mother.
what I must ask you is difficult.
explain, my child.
that's just it, allow me to not explain.
see Thérèse when she's released!
you're giving orders now, Sister?
it's a humble but insistent prayer.
she needs us, but she won't come here.
we must go to her.
I beg of you.
go.
insufferable child!
to which children did St Benedict tell us to listen sometimes?
the insufferable or the wise?
at 9: 00, Mother. 5 more minutes.
2 minutes, Mr. Roger.
if Mother Prioress' watch says 8: 58, I believe it.
I'll stay here, Mother.
you talk to her, I trust you.
some role you ask me to play!
I must look like a cat waiting by a mouse hole.
here she is!
there should be 350 francs.
it's raining. Want to wait?
go on. You'll manage.
you're young and smart.
above all, don't abuse your freedom. You'll be fine.
Hello, Mother. You're here to see me?
I'm off to court. It's 9 AM.
very well, Warden.
I'm happy you're free. You were here a long time, right?
2 years.
going to your family? - I have none.
friends? - I haven't any.
you live in town?
I live nowhere.
then your solitude allows me to speak to you.
if things get hard, our house is yours.
you're welcome there.
very well, Mother.
if you have any problems, come speak to me.
I'll be happy to help you out.
thank you.
some people won't understand, they'll shut their doors.
farewell, Mother.
Thérèse, come, I beg you.
leave me alone. You're crazy!
I'd like a revolver. - Large caliber?
medium.
I have a Herstahl for 75 or a Reduro for 100 francs.
Reduro's best. Know how the catch works?
no. - Here.
safety to the right, fire to the left.
6 bullets. 12 with the extra clip. Is that enough?
if it's not, I'll come back.
I didn't bring Thérèse back, Mother. You win.
sister Anne-Marie, some feelings are unwelcome here.
Self-Iove is one.
forgive me, but it has the word "love."
so, Thérèse called you crazy?
to tell me I was right. No, Mother?
I'm glad you've such devotion, but don't waste it.
it's for all your Sisters, not just Thérèse.
allow me to speak to You directly.
your Saints will understand why I didn't solicit them.
see me, hear me Yourself.
deliver me from this anguish in my heart.
tell me the task You gave me by letting me hear a poor, tormented soul's secret is but a test from which my greatest joy shall be born.
protect us now and forever.
deliver us from evil...
it's you? Hello. - Hello.
so St Francis said to him:
brother Wolf, you've done great harm in this region.
destroying God's creatures "without His permission.
you not only slay and devour beasts, "you're so brazen as to kill men made in God's image.
so you deserve to be put to death as a thief and murderer.
everyone cries out against you.
what is it?
mother, someone's at the door.
you have good ears, we heard nothing. And then?
and then? - Go on.
everyone cries out against you, "the whole world is your enemy.
brother Wolf, I want to make peace, so you no longer offend them, "and they forgive all past offenses. So neither men nor dogs..."
the door again. Why not open it?
read, Sister.
I'm sure it's Thérèse, Mother!
it's been opened!
Thérèse, my child!
what a lovely surprise. You have something to tell me?
please take me in. - You look sick. We'll care for you.
you'll take me? You won't send me away?
I can't go back, I hate the world.
you speak nonsense. You don't understand.
hate didn't bring you here.
sister Anne-Marie will be happy, she was worried.
worried?
I'm so happy! I knew you'd come!
you called her name loudly. She heard you.
she can stay, right?
the Council will decide. For a few months, on trial.
she's too unwell to leave now.
have you eaten? - I'm not hungry.
take care of her, Sister Anne-Marie.
I was so scared!
scared of what?
of misfortune, of evil.
that you'd gone to seek revenge, but not forgiveness.
but I was sure you'd come.
Why?
by grace.
I'm sure I felt everything you felt yesterday.
you felt my call. I saw you everywhere...
think they'll accept me?
they're all expecting you.
I've made a place for you. Even your habit is ready.
Thérèse, I'll teach you to find true happiness.
teaching a pupil beatitude, being God's seamstress...
you've brought me this gift, thank you.
you have the weapon?
still no leads? - One, it's a woman, of slight build.
she shot in a panic, bottom to top.
two, it's revenge. Nothing was stolen.
no prints is the print of revenge.
revenge!
start with his friends!
all this joy, songs, festivity are for you, rewards for your suffering.
we werert Sister Thérèse, yet had the same ceremony.
and in your new robe you've stayed the same.
true. - I'd recognize her with a veil.
my hair shows? Why wasrt it cut?
our last tie to the world isn't cut till we take our vows.
my name wasrt changed?
out of respect for you. At my request.
Why?
it's none of your business.
be careful, you took a bad pupil.
she's more trouble than you think for your place in heaven.
2 PM, in the laundry room.
at 2, Sister Anne-Marie and I sing.
she's taking care of you.
at 5, she reads me The Golden Legend.
at 7, she has me say a special prayer.
she gives you much of her time.
her time, heart, and soul. Too much!
show her she's going too far.
she doesn't understand.
you came here for her. Seeing you is her reward.
she shows me off like a curiosity.
with all of her lessons, I feel like I'm being exhibited!
she's really exhibiting herself.
there's the devil!
horrible Blackie!
what's that?
Blackie, Mother St Johrs cat.
show me your eyes, Sister Thérèse.
that's not quite it.
your eyes aren't joyful.
I've shown you how.
it doesn't work.
that's what worries me. Your eyes don't change.
I've an idea, come on. - Where?
to the garden. You'll cut flowers for the altar.
sister Marie-Josèhehe can come.
Yes, Reverend Mother!
to show me what flowers are?
no, what a bouquet for God is.
we'll innovate. Instead of the usual mixed bunches, we'll make bouquets with roses, carnations and lilies.
know the language of flowers?
no. - I'll teach you.
I haven't much to tell them... - Sister Anne-Marie!
where are you going? - To the garden.
you were excused from your duties?
this is urgent. - Obey the rules!
rules? This is the one place where the heart rules!
I'll report this to the Chapter of Faults.
my heart won't proclaim.
go to your cell, Sister Anne-Marie. I'll take Sister Thérèse today.
anything new? - No.
you? I'm not surprised.
you think criminals return to the crime scene.
they're no longer that considerate. They're too busy!
and you?
one lead. A woman friend released from jail the day he was killed.
what's she got to say? - She's vanished.
got a description? - Yes, and photos.
why are you beating your laundry by hand?
St Hildegard did. She respected everything white.
wort make you a Saint.
why not? That's why we're here.
all but you. You're a lay sister, lay sisters aren't canonized.
if I chose the lay sisters, there'd be saints galore.
like Anne-Marie?
why not?
St Gertrude said: "Happiness begets saintliness.
she's the happiest one here.
it's nice to see her happy.
and so self-confident.
she should be careful.
maybe we should warn her.
about what?
the Superiors admire her.
as do we.
but she worries them.
they think she's self-centered.
she's unaware of the danger.
she's in no great danger. - Yes, she is.
no more than us, we're still here.
we're imperfect by nature.
but rehabilitated sisters must be flawless.
she's so nervous, she makes a scene over anything.
want a place, Sister Thérèse? - Thank you.
you look worried, Sister Thérèse.
I don't think so. - Yes, what's wrong?
I'd best not tell you.
very well.
sister Anne-Marie!
there's a conspiracy against you.
a conspiracy? Don't say that word, it's bad.
you're denied prison visits.
we take turns! - Mother St John banned you.
who says so? - Everyone does. She's wrong.
the others lack your gifts.
mother Prioress knows.
she loves us all.
you're her favorite.
she likes your spontaneity, your enthusiasm.
my enthusiasm?
your impulsiveness.
everything Mother St John hates.
I heard you singing, it's a call I can't resist.
it's not exactly a hymn, Sister. I heard you whistling.
it's the prettiest hymn of all, the finches' song.
we don't have songbirds in cages?
nightingales and finches love liberty.
we mustrt cage them!
your cell's untidy.
it's even a bit dusty.
flowers cheer it up. - Pretty.
but the rules also say we may not cage flowers.
they begged me to pick them.
if every pretty thing begged to be in a Dominican cell, where would we be?
every pretty thing is in mine, I collect them.
hence the untidiness.
the beauty in my books so awed me that I replaced them badly.
I awoke to such a fine day that my bed's unmade.
your head's so full of pretty images your hair sticks out.
mere details...
there are no details in life.
saints treat all duties the same way.
details are born of negligence.
job wasrt clean, sitting on manure.
were he here, he'd make his bed and wash his eyes in 2 hours!
unless your cat left him a gift!
don't pick on Blackie. He's ugly, but rids us of mice.
where'll I put the flowers? Now they're unwon'thy of the chapel.
you see, you kept them from their mission, made them yours.
we'll take them to the cemetery.
the dead like what belonged to the living.
don't dedicate your days to Sister Thérèse, neglecting others and yourself.
abandoning her is a betrayal!
to? - God and myself.
mother St John knows very well who betrays and who is loyal.
play anything, tell riddles.
I only know one.
which one?
what goes up white and falls yellow?
I know: The sun.
Why?
it's a Dominican.
what is it? - An egg.
mine's funnier.
what's worse, dust on furniture or the soul?
why that question?
mother St John thinks dusty tables shock God.
And?
I think He's more offended by dust on the soul.
dust on the soul?
hypocrisy, for instance.
why this example? It's not a casual choice.
no, it isn't.
a dusty table is better than Sisters petting Blackie and cursing him behind Mother St Johrs back.
right, Sister Marie-Josèhehe?
me? What did I do?
sister Colette?
sister Anne-Marie, bring your criticisms to the Chapter of Faults.
it's not a matter for recreation time.
you know that. I disapprove.
don't be so harsh!
I'm sure you and my Sisters agree.
there's a way to find out what we think. Request it.
sisterly correction! I'd be happy to do that.
sisterly correction, Sister Henri.
what do you think of me? - Good, but stubborn.
unpretentious, but proud. Intelligent, but excitable.
is that bad?
I'm here to enlighten you, not to judge you.
sister Jacques?
you're hot-tempered, prejudiced and vain.
irascible. - Thank you, Sister Jacques.
sister Thérèse?
how do you value me?
above the others.
it's not about you. I'm vain, right?
you're outspoken, but ashamed.
full of self-Iove? - You want others to like you.
I'm edgy, messy, stubborn?
you're loyal, you're yourself.
sister Madeleine?
you think highly of yourself.
you don't understand people.
not Madeleine, Sister Madeleine.
coquettish, ambitious, stubborn.
that's not true!
why do you all say this?
we all feel the same.
the others could be mistaken, but not you!
I thought you knew me. I thought you loved me.
you had ready the words that hurt me most.
your anger is like town gossip!
we're in God's light here.
thoughts and actions have a higher meaning.
and you behave like ants!
you're unwon'thy.
thank you, Sister.
you're jealous. You're mean.
I know.
you show me my flaws, I believe you.
but there's only one voice that I shall obey.
no one can stop me.
...suffered at the hands of many, "even those whom she'd most helped in her days of prosperity."
among them was an old woman "who had received food and mercy from the Saint during a famine.
meeting her in the street, "that they had to cross on a plank because of the sludge, the miserable woman pushed her benefactress, who fell into the mud."
she was thus exposed to disgrace and mockery, "to which the Saint responded..."
what is it?
stop petting Blackie.
...happy to suffer such humiliation out of love for Jesus Christ, "who fills the hearts of the faithful with consolation..."
I proclaim Sister Anne-Marie for mistreating an animal.
for penance, she'll read the Litanies.
I did not yield the way to an older Sister on entering the Chapter.
proclamations for Marie-Josèhehe?
Yes, for petting an animal.
what?
in the workshop... - No explanations here.
for penance, this week she'll enter last for services.
I laughed and turned around in chapel.
any proclamations for Sister Colette?
I proclaim her for petting an animal.
she'll sweep the chapel.
I am guilty of interrupting a Sister.
proclamations for Sister Thomas?
for petting an animal.
cease your proclamations!
the Council doesn't understand your proclamations.
mother St John surely does.
explain! You can't proclaim Sisters for petting animals.
they pet the Devil! - That's nonsense.
it's true, that beast came to hurt us.
it's an innocent animal.
it's Beelzebub! He should be judged.
because of him, Sisters commit mortal sins.
they rightly hate him.
he steals, hates us all, is a burden.
but Mother St John likes him.
they pet him for her, kick him behind her back.
Beelzebub proudly walks around.
look in his eyes, see a path of lies and hypocrisy!
sister!
a bluebird used to come here, it brought joy and sincerity.
and a toad that made us feel compassionate.
mother St Johrs cat ate them.
I'd proclaim her if I could, for not opposing it.
leave. You'll learn your penance in the refectory.
I impose a public penance for the scandal she caused.
sister Anne-Marie will kiss all her Sisters' feet.
when the appointed time had come, "the Son of God, "after 30 years of silence, "went forth to sow the celestial seed "of His Divine message...
I demand the rule be enforced.
she knows if she refuses she may be sent away?
she does.
sister, do you refuse you penance?
continue reading.
when the appointed time had come, the Son of God, "after 30 years of silence...
where will I go?
your family is expecting you. - My family!
I gave up that world.
sending me back is unfair.
my dear child...
I loved the world I left.
you don't know how much I loved it.
I ripped it from my heart to come here.
it was horrible, but I did.
I'll never again find peace there.
you force me to return to what will only be unappiness.
I beg of you, keep me.
I'm sorry, Anne-Marie.
my God, I'm no longer Sister Anne-Marie.
God knows you have no better friend than me.
I've esteem for your character, but there's no advantage for the community if you stay.
I'm asking for a huge sacrifice, but consider it to be a sacrifice and not a penance.
farewell, Mother.
is it raining?
no, my umbrella ensures sunshine.
very wise.
our prison visits are always rainy.
Yes, this is the convent.
mother, it's Anne-Marie's family! She hasn't returned.
she said nothing? - No.
Hello?
Yes, Anne-Marie left that day.
she was well.
no, I'm not worried. She's like that.
I'll ask around. I'll call you back.
you're really not worried?
let's ask Sister Madeleine.
sister Madeleine!
Yes, Mother?
did Anne-Marie say where she'd go?
she didn't return to her family? I knew it!
she said nothing?
no, nothing.
let's not be late.
you're holding the saw wrong, Sister.
get closer, bend over it, unless you want to tire yourself.
did you grease the saw?
sister Marie-Josehe, your woodpile will collapse.
Yes, Reverend Mother.
why "Reverend Mother"?
why can't you do anything right today?
unlike you, since Sister Anne-Marie left!
you're overjoyed that she's gone!
what's she have to do with it?
I'll tell you: You drove her away!
I don't know why or how, but you did.
you hated her, you're glad she's gone! She was too good!
you set her against Mother St John.
you're such a hypocrite,
I feel like hitting you!
what's going on?
two Sisters chatter instead of working!
sister Therese, oversee them.
it's already done.
you've a full hall, Mother, 30 applicants.
anyone new? - One who's surprising.
each prison has a rebel.
it used to be 17-21. Remember Therese?
another wants to see you.
let's go.
I got a call about Therese.
a friend of hers was murdered.
shot. The police are looking for her.
she must know the motive.
she may be an accomplice.
I wouldn't be surprised if she did it.
no one here would be if she killed herself, too.
do you remember her? Remember the scene she caused?
I remember very well.
council meeting, at once!
mother Prioress is back from prison sooner than usual.
we can't take risks for someone trying to save herself.
in the here and now or the hereafter?
vocations are often bred of crime.
true, Mother.
we must not concern ourselves with her guilt, but with her redemption.
I have great doubt as to that.
Why? She's obedient and follows the rules.
if only they were all so easy...
I'm not afraid of scandal, as you well know.
we must reach a decision, her trial period is over.
we won't turn her in, or abandon her.
but after having had to expel a pure soul like Anne-Marie,
I can't be lenient in this doubtful case.
I could find a religious home to protect her and give her work.
do it fast.
someone's trespassing, there's a hole in the hedge.
someone stealing our peaches. - No.
sister Agnes, who once stole them, now checks them.
none missing.
anything odd in the convent?
not so far. - Any footprints?
I saw none... but you may.
I'm flattered to be promoted to detective.
our Founding Father's here, what could go wrong?
Yes, someone came through.
someone who didn't fear the nettles.
it's a small hole. Maybe a lamb...
I'll fill it up with thorns tonight.
you, in your sleepless slumber, whose eyes see all of us, thank you for receiving me each night!
the hole was full of thorns tonight.
the others think I am an intruder who comes to steal a little eternal peace, but I shall always be your Daughter.
when I leave my barn to come here, the path that brings me to you is as wide as the world.
you are not yet a Saint.
you wanted to share our misery for as long as possible as a simple human being, as our Brother.
that is why, before my prayers, I beseech you...
help me! My punishment was too severe.
and Therese...
Therese, who you entrusted to me...
allow me to hear her voice in this song, as I am no longer allowed to sing...
is she dead? - She's breathing.
but she's so cold.
sister Anne-Marie!
let's take her to the infirmary.
you won't kiss her?
Therese?
she's here, hush. You'll see her.
she came through the hedge. - Every night.
she's very sick.
what does the doctor say?
there's no hope. Her heart may give out any moment.
such fine news I hear!
did Mother Prioress tell you?
she says I'm dying. - Sister Anne-Marie!
convents panic. They give you Extreme Unction for a cold.
this will be my first Extreme Unction.
you must tell her. She can't go without knowing.
she doesn't want to know.
how strange not to sense death approaching.
it's horrible to have to tell her.
but I can try again...
don't forget my penance, Mother.
I must do it fast.
my Sisters' feet keep passing in a procession before me.
of course. When you're able.
see, you're granting me a respite.
don't be sad, Mother.
I assure you, God couldn't be so cruel...
as to give me such an important mission...
and only allow me to throw a cat into the hall.
he wouldn't allow it.
he knows what He's doing. We've only to wait.
I'm waiting, Mother.
well?
Therese won't leave yet.
Therese? - Anne-Marie's holding on for her.
that's why she thinks she can cheat death.
we can't separate them now, when their game is unfolding.
you hate me, don't you?
why would I?
because I treated you badly.
you had good intentions.
I behaved foolishly.
as if I could teach you, when, in fact, I knew nothing.
I was foolish.
no, you werert.
my only excuse is that I did it out of love for you.
I thought I knew you, but I didn't.
no harm, I'm not interesting.
you are.
you alone interest me.
I know that now.
I know why you're here. - I think not.
I made you lie to me, tell me you came because of me.
it was childish of me.
don't speak so much.
you came to hide.
from whom?
from whom or what isn't my concern.
something horrible happened to you when you got out.
you saw your world aflame, you saw a ghost...
you came here to hide. - Not true.
instead of abandoning life, you abandoned the world.
I should have helped you, but I didn't.
I made you into the Prodigal Child.
I dragged you into the light.
cried out your name to all, to God...
I was grotesque. - Sister!
I strutted proudly beside you...
you, who had been flayed alive.
I now see what you needed.
though it may be too late. - What did I need?
a silent presence, someone to stop your tears with silence, and your suffering by her presence.
simply a friend.
a friend... Why are you getting up?
because I'm leaving.
I don't want to be near you!
you're lying again!
you're trying something else on me!
prestige wasrt enough. Now friendship!
no, you don't understand.
there's one cure for my suffering: Indifference.
flayed, that's right.
you can't caress the flayed, or dress the flayed...
God, when can I be alone?
you are.
that's what hurts so much.
it's me, Therese.
I see you.
I'm not getting better, am I?
there must be a cure.
there is one cure. It'll work.
tell Mother Prioress.
our Mother can't help.
I'm dying because I failed to get what I wanted.
you're too ambitious.
maybe so.
you thought the world was pretty, that life had hope.
I still do.
I thought I'd heal a broken heart.
a broken heart can be healed, but not a dead one.
if I thought I could do it, I'd live.
it may take 100 years.
then I'd live 100 years.
you look better.
Yes. Maybe it's the first day of my 100 years.
is that you, Mother?
I was right the other day,
Therese is the killer.
Yes, I assure you.
the gunsmith...
the gunsmith who sold the gun recognized her photo.
sorry I had to tell them you had contact with her.
they'll have to come to the convent.
let go of my hand! - It helps me.
that's not why you hold it, you want to know what it did.
your hand is a question.
then answer it.
you pry into my eyes, watch my gestures!
even when you pretend to sleep, I know you listen to my steps.
you spy for Mother Prioress!
sister Therese! - Look at this face.
look at it well, and remember what you see. You'll never see it again!
I can't go on.
you know my secret now. Are you glad?
you held my hands to handcuff them.
go ahead! Turn me in!
if I speak of you, it won't be in this world.
no one in the convent will turn you in.
but you can't keep living a lie, or deceive our Mother.
I can't get up, Sister Therese.
please tell Mother Prioress.
I'm going.
beloved Sister, we entrust you to Almighty God, "who created you from the dust you return to."
now your soul shall leave your body.
shining angels are ready to greet you.
the Apostles shall judge you.
the triumphant, white army of martyrs is coming toward you.
the choir of virgins draws you into the blissful sleep of the patriarchs.
the Holy Mother of God...
Yes, I am ready.
I said goodbye to an old woman.
what did she say? Can she pronounce her vows?
she's delirious. We'll wait.
the Sister with birds!
you swim so fast, I can't keep up!
I feel so ill.
I feel so wonderful.
she's dying!
Yes, sing the Salve Regina.
the police. Tell Mother Prioress.
the police!
the police.
let them wait.
let them wait. I've waited, too.
mother Prioress will fix everything.
sister Anne-Marie, can you take your solemn vows?
Yes, Mother. But hurry...
the Book of Constitutions.
I, Sister Anne-Marie, profess to you...
I can't speak...
Therese...
I, Sister Anne-Marie, profess to you...
that I shall obey...
God, the Most Holy Virgin Mary, the Blessed Patriarch Dominic, and you, my Mother, according to our rule.
and I shall remain obedient until my death...
see you soon, Sister.
how terrible for the earth and the sea!
the devil has come down to you, and he is filled wlth rage, as he knows that he has such llttle tlme left.
another HEAVEN
watch your step.
nice smelI.
maybe stew.
did the IandIord inform us?
Yeah. He was Iaughing.
what? Laughing?
when shocked, guys act in an odd way.
this place is new.
but no one wiIl rent it after this.
if TV reports this place, it'Il be finished.
the body seems fairly clean.
he's new.
nice smeIl, eh? Stew?
evidently the victim's a good cook.
lt's a cIue.
may I take a Iook?
Pork-no-chicken stew.
sure smelIs good.
how nice!
makes me hungry.
behave. There's a stiff here.
inspector Tobitaka and Dr. Akagi are coming.
oid Akagi too?
let's light it.
be carefuI.
pIease!
sorr y.
look.
his head's empty.
an insuIt to the dead!
lt's reaIIy empty.
what?
he has no brains.
then...
where are they?
the brains.
Hey, hey!
is it that terribIe?
what's with you?
Manabu!
what's this nice smelI?
AwfuI!
let's go.
what's with him?
the worst case I ever saw was a severed penis in the corpse's mouth.
how base!
I remember seeing a simiIar neck injury.
a zoo breeder was kiIIed by a goriIIa 20 years ago.
then a gorilla did that too.
a gorilIa chef.
a gourmet too.
how can you taIk Iike that?
ass! I'm shocked, too.
I doubt it.
inspector!
there's a tubious man.
say "" dubious. "
he Iives nextdoor.
can't make it out. Speak clearIy!
sorry.
it tastes Iike cheese.
he ran!
Hey, wait!
to the rear!
let go of me!
I didn't do it.
who said you did?
knock it off!
you said the kiIler was strong and a good cook.
you're trying to pin it on me, huh?
you're nice and strong.
does it matter?
lt sure does.
what do you do?
a butcher. So what?
butcher, eh?
I sIice meat and seII it. l cook stew to seIl, too.
my stew is tasty, they say.
anyway, what's it to you, huh?
he did it.
dear!
Hey, stop!
this ls where the murder occurred.
judging from the victim's injury, the kiIIer was a man weighing over 100 kg.
he had a grip of over 150 kg.
don't mention his cooking.
we'II get started.
bizarre Murder Cases
not bizarre crimes.
the guy killed his victims instantIy.
the butcher's innocent.
know why the neighbor was kiIled?
he rushed in when the kiIIer was cooking.
he broke his neck and threw him out.
he got mad?
he's sadistic and Ioses his temper easiIy.
why so sure?
a woman in the room.
he' d been sent to paradise once.
he arranged flowers too.
he had Iots of caII girl fliers, but...
who's she?
Dr. Sasamoto at the police hospital.
she was watching Manabu.
not a calI girl.
he had porno videos. He hid them from her.
I don't think he had a woman... unlike you.
who do you mean?
a cabaret hostess.
that? Name was Asako.
smaII fingerprints.
the killer was big.
so, the kiIler was a beauty.
smali hands, but she weighs over 100 kg.
is that it?
nonsense. The kiIler was a man.
inspector!
inspector!
another murder! Another empty head!
stew again?
no.
meat loaf?
spaghetti sauce.
let's go!
heII! My favorite food!
the fingerprints.
We'Il probabIy get more stiffs like this.
inedible food too.
another victim was diiscovered.
the total number ls...
five now.
how long must lt go on?
TV shows too much brutality.
lt invites crime.
too much violence appears in novels and movies.
as children grow, such scenes become ingrained.
they must be outlawed.
was I dreaming?
had a nightmare?
I was watching you.
how did you get in?
the door was open.
what a careIess cop!
the murder cases?
get out.
your case was cIosed.
why must we meet?
he was cooking?
then ""she. " Not ""he. "
don't Iook.
why beIieve the kiIIer's a man?
no man can be such a good cook.
some men can.
they're good cooks.
onIy girls learn cooking of this sort.
she must be a beauty.
she can hook a man easily. She arranges fIowers too.
a woman can't break a man's neck.
it's hard for a man, too.
how did she do it?
it's simpIe.
what?
her superhuman power.
lt's possible.
I thought about it, too.
you're Iying.
it fits in perfectIy.
she had sex.
but someone used physic power.
with human hands.
he needed too much strength for a woman.
not superhuman power.
is that so?
you think so, Manabu?
don't " Manabu " me.
now, get out.
l have special ability.
like what?
a keen sense. I can teIl how peopIe feeI.
nonsense!
how you feel, too.
leave.
you came to my place, too.
to investigate.
after I busted your man...
he wasn't my man.
only to investigate?
after that, I met you five times in town...
that didn't start anything like ""Iove. "
l have work to do.
I'm tired, too.
leave, huh?
aII right.
my bag.
I'm sure it was a woman.
Manabu?
you're reaIly tired.
poor guy!
Hey.
stop it.
let's do it.
aII right, eh?
I love you.
a voIuntar y teacher for the handicapped?
he's the seventh victim. Found in...
a vinegared stew?
his parents were killed in an accident.
he got their money and started voIunteering?
he was unfortunate.
he wanted to help people from their misery.
you want to do the same?
no.
did you suffer misfortune?
my parents' divorce.
it took me Iong to overcome it.
divorce makes chiIdren Ioose and lascivious.
you mustn't say that.
why not?
what about you?
ass!
what's that red stuff?
how couId you do that?
what a shame!
a UFO room, eh?
UFOs exist.
seen one?
think Earth's a gIobe?
of course!
seen it?
TV and photos. Even babies know.
I saw UFOs on TV and in photos.
Manabu.
you're a cop, eh?
so what?
cops mustn't believe in UFOs. Wake up!
sorr y. My teacher told me to come.
that's alI right. Come out.
Chi-chan stayed here for three days.
she wanted to do naughty things with him.
he didn't want to.
but one day Chi-chan got on him by force.
after that, she cut open his head Iike this.
she cut it open. I was scared!
he wasn't thinking anything bad.
he wasn't tasty. She said so.
teII his school.
did he see it?
don't ask me!
sir!
where are you?
why run away?
where are you?
sir?
where are you going?
sir!
wait, sir!
don't run!
No! No!
missing people get mixed up in crime.
they aren't felons.
I know.
believe in UFOs and ghosts? Enough!
why deny what reaIIy happened?
we can't beIieve in everything.
we can't ask ghost for help.
how muIish!
in the first place, how couId a woman rape a man?
found her?
here!
Chizuru Kashiwagi, a coIlege student.
she became missing three days before the first case.
she's "Chi-chan. "
she's weird.
she okay?
be patient.
I'm sure we can do anything to her.
it's for sure. What'II we do?
don't force yourself to drink.
sorry.
no butter.
don't I have any?
what about salad oiI?
no.
I'II go buy some.
no. I'II go.
don't bother. I'II go myseIf.
excuse me.
hurry.
What're you cooking?
something delicious. I need more ingredients.
sIice the fish yourseIf?
the fish are Iucky.
sorry.
be patient.
Hey, Chizuru...
don't move so fast.
I can hear.
hear what?
your bad thoughts.
it's fun to open a head.
bad thoughts change brains' coIor.
and...
it's refIected in hair, too.
l reaIized it only Iately.
your hair's stiff.
I don't Iike this.
I bought butter.
WelI?
where are they?
they're resting.
resting?
Hey, wait a minute.
what?
I'II use a rubber.
it's for your sake, too.
why must everyone provoke me?
afraid of disease?
no.
about disease...
only the living need to worry.
heIp!
heIp!
five on the baIcony, four on the veranda.
seven at the fire escape.
one in the basement car park.
two in every corridor. Okay?
we're ready.
let's go.
he says a Chizuru did it.
the informer? Who can telI?
this way.
it's open.
over there too!
caIl an ambulance!
no brains.
lt's empty.
cooI down!
Where's the kiIIer?
cool down first.
let's look for the kilIer and more victims.
coId... coId...
you okay?
be brave!
a bIanket!
poIice. You're alI right.
your name?
Kimura... it's Kimura.
you're aII right.
the gal's dead.
there was no one else here.
Meaning?
the kilIer was...
Chizuru.
you said she couIdn't be.
I realize she was!
her brains are gone.
how couId she kiII?
at least her heart was beating.
a bIanket.
a colIege student kiIIed a man and cooked his brains.
and her brains got Iost, too.
unbeIievabIe!
saying there's another kiIIer? Where's he?
teII me!
noisy kid!
what's up?
what is it?
lovely hair...
college STUDENT SUSPECTED OF MURDER
going out?
you like me?
why ask?
just telI me.
your face.
stay in bed.
what's up?
aII you see is...
how l Iook.
l want you to be as you look. It's obvious.
what about you?
what?
what do you like...
I don't know.
you asked me first.
let's go.
together? Where to?
just get up.
what happened here?
Chizuru became missing.
she' d been with a friend.
she was standing there.
three days Iater, the murders began.
she was studying cooking and fIower arrangement.
she had thin wrists.
she broke men's necks?
her brains were gone, too.
yet, the poIice...
tried to decide she was the kiIler.
they believe only what they can see.
the kilIer ran.
ran?
not Chizuru.
something evil ran from her head.
she's a good girI.
she was so obedient that she grew frustrated.
she was under stress.
so eviI attracted her.
frustrated?
it's just a Iump of stone.
I detest enduring things.
her father wants her back.
her brains weren't gone.
they shrank and dried up in a corner.
fiIIed with uicers, too.
brain uicers?
how could she live until now?
how could she waIk?
I want to keep such a rarity here.
she was ilI?
how could she have kiIled?
but she really did it.
there's physicaI evidence.
she wasn't a big man.
her potentiaIity.
a mother lifts a car to save her kid.
that's absurd!
that doesn't matter.
two guys were aImost kiIIed by Chizuru.
she was arrested and died.
case cIosed. lt's over.
let me say this again...
no thanks.
without brains, how couId she think?
yet she did. That's a fact.
stilI arguing?
Mr. Hayase.
a phone caIl for you.
HeIIo?
Manabu?
who is this?
HeIIo?
Chlzuru was standing before that statue, eh?
you Kimura?
how did you know?
think. You'll know the answer.
answer! How did you know?
l have a gift for you.
a gift?
room 1009, Hotel Excellent.
my gift for you.
Kimura! Hey!
a crime buff.
he tapped into our radio.
guys like that are around.
open it.
for Beloved Manabu "
brains did it!
look for the kiIler.
Chizuru's brains moved to Kimura.
so he did the same.
nonsense. Move!
HeIIo?
mysterious, eh?
why copy what Chizuru did?
l knew you' d say so. Stupld!
shut up! Damn you!
there!
Manabu.

Freeze!

he's crazy!

what's he doing?
baiting us.
some guy!
don't overdo it, Pop.
shut up!
you got better at shooting.
just by chance.
shoot his groin. He kissed you.
I'II kilI him.
this is Hayase. I'm at the condominium...
is murder bad?
of course!
of course?
TV's filIed with murder.
murder takes place in dramas, movies and news.
everyone's bored. They crave fun.
life without murder's boring to you too, eh?
what are you?
what am I?
a spaceman?
spaceman, eh?
answer.
it's only today's humans that think of space wars.
drop bombs to protect us!
I'm human, a reaI human.
no kidding!
I'm not kidding. I'm a human.
l know...
that you can understand me.
no humans have your power.
we're friends.
let's pIay together.
I'm not gay.
then what do you like?
lay off him, Manabu!
no probIem.
bruises and three cracked ribs.
it's not a problem?
just Iie stiII. Your brains are aII right, too.
lie stilI?
for a week, at Ieast.
a problem.
Why? The case is aImost cIosed, right?
the kilIer's seriously wounded?
that inspector shot an unarmed man three times.
I shot him, too.
he wasn't armed, eh?
a spaceman...
I mean him.
I'II check your brains again.
do so.
I was joking.
there you are!
excuse me.
leave!
what?
excuse me.
you stay. She's Ieaving.
I came just now.
I'II leave. Take care.
I'm not Ieaving.
why the sungIasses?
to be incognito.
you won't be.
I Iooked everywhere for you.
does it hurt?
Yeah.
I was in danger.
thought I' d die.
don't say that.
that reminds me. You were right.
the kiIler.
what was he?
I don't know.
he enters a human head.
said he was a human.
a human?
said I'm his friend.
a friend?
a friend.
he didn't mean to kiIl me.
what's ""friend " ?
I'm not heIping people.
Meaning...?
I'm just a crime buff.
a crime buff?
I Iistened to police radios and phones.
I rushed to the scene.
l was a student then.
everything was real.
reaI crimes were great.
I liked it.
the evil enchanted me.
so I became a cop.
I'm not heIping people.
he reaIized it.
I never mentioned it.
but...
but what?
you helped me once...
from bad peopIe.
I didn't mean to.
lt was my job.
that's aIl.
great work!
michael is having a heart attack.
that's my girl! - So...
take it. Take it.
shell. $15, 000, Shell.
I'm thinking fishing boat.
Oh, you might be thinking fishing boat.
I'm thinking a gown.
nice. -Yes.
well, if you went one more and you didn't knock out the 75, your offer would be about 37, 000, so there's a wedding plus a gown.
there's no denying, Michael, that is exceptionally good cash.
there's no denying that the risk...
you called the ambos up? -Yeah.
what has she taken? -Heroin.
but there is also no doubting that if you avoid it, your next offer will be something like 25.
no guts, no glory, I suppose.
it's all up to you, Darl.
think clearly, though.
no deal!
look at your husband.
so...
I'm sorry, I don't remember if I have actually asked number 14 what she thought she may have.
Narcan's in? -Yes.
Oh, yes, you did too, didn't you?
Oh, Lordy, Lordy! -Lots of Lordy!
hello.
grandma, it's J.
who? -Josh.
Oh, Josh!
how are you, darlin'?
Yeah, good.
um, Mum's gone and OD'd and she's died and so...
are you OK?
Yeah, I'm OK. Sorry.
I probably should have said it a bit slower and not just go and blurt it out like that.
I don't really know what I'm supposed to do now.
where is she? -They took her away.
the ambulance came.
what about the cops, honey?
they showed up and they took a statement and that, but I said that I was 18 and now I don't really know what I'm supposed to do.
right, right.
they didn't say anything, you know.
like, am I supposed to organise the funeral and that?
like, I don't know what I'm supposed to do with all the paperwork and the arrangements and that, you know?
Yeah.
and I remember when Grandpa Donny died that you were on top of everything, so, you know, I called.
listen, baby, hang on. I'm coming to get you, OK?
Yep. Um...
do you... do you remember where we live?
of course I do, sweetheart.
you sit tight. I'll be right there.
Yep. OK.
Bye.
Oh! Puffed.
you got your bags packed?
come here, sweetie.
get your bags, honey.
mum kept me away from her family because she was scared.
I didn't realise it at the time, but they were all scared, even if they didn't show it.
I think even Barry Brown was scared, even though he never showed it.
everyone felt safe around Baz.
he'd punch your head off if you got in the way,
if he was in the middle of an armed rob and...
9400
...you got between him and the door, he'd put you on the ground and not think twice about it.
morning, baby.
but he was good to me.
and to everyone else.
you want juice? Smurf's juicing.
Hi, Uncle Darren.
seriously, you've got to stop calling me 'uncle'.
it gives me the creeps.
Darren was only a couple of years older than me.
when we were little Kids, he was like my best friend.
we used to throw rocks at cars and that.
he had a way better BMX than me.
Daisy, come here!
my bike was shit.
come here. Good girl. Come on.
come on, come on. -What you doing, hon?
what's it look like? Get out!
stay there.
stay there!
Oh, Mum. Fuck. Seriously!
what the fuck is going on?
who said you could bring that noise thing in my house?
it's yours. -It is not. Bullshit.
Yes, it is. I found it under the sink.
do you want a juice? -No.
my uncle Craig moved really fast like... he was trying to stay in front of something.
Craig. -What?
come here. -I'm busy.
and Grandma Smurf...
doing what? -I'm just busy.
come here and give me a kiss.
...she just seemed to want to be wherever the boys were.
and she just wanted to be around whatever the boys were doing.
but they were all scared, even if they didn't show it.
even if they didn't know it exactly.
even if they were having to do what crooks do all the time, which is block out the thing they must know
they must know it.. which is that crooks always come undone.
always.
one way or another.
in Melbourne at this time, this was a while ago now, the Armed Robbery Squad was out of control.
they were shooting guys willy-nilly and getting away with it.
and they'd been after Baz and my family for months.
but the guy they really wanted, the guy they really hated, was my other uncle - uncle Andrew.
but everyone just called him Pope.
he was hiding in a motel room somewhere 'cause he heard he was next.
these are for you.
Thanks, mate.
he's not here. You guys are wasting your time.
who's not here?
you know who I mean.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Craig was selling drugs.
he was selling lots of them.
has your brother heard the noises Armed Robbery Squad have been making?
Yeah.
he said they're out to get him so he's fucked off somewhere.
he had a detective in the drug squad helping him do it.
a guy called Randall Roache.
is this the Anderis gear?
no, that's half. The other half's still in lockup.
we'll talk about it later, mate. My kid's in the car.
I've got to go to soccer practice.
they'd meet in a fish shop In Footscray 'cause Craig loved fish.
what have they got against him, anyway?
well, they want him gone, mate.
they don't think anything they've done's gonna stand in court so they want to put him off themselves.
and why are they going on about Pope?
what about Baz and Darren? -Fuck, I don't know.
you know what these guys are like. They're cowboys.
they do whatever they want. -What's he supposed to do?
just tell him to pull his fucking head in, mate.
the whole thing's falling apart over there.
armed Robbery's about to be disbanded and everything will just go away.
just tell him to pull his fucking head in.
his head's in. Your head doesn't get any more in than Pope's head.
mate, even if I gave a shit, you'd be telling the wrong bloke.
fuck!
and I don't know, like, all this seems strange to me but not strange either.
you know what I mean?
kids just are wherever they are and they just do whatever they're doing, you know?
this is where I was and this is what I was doing.
after my mum died, this was just the world I got thrown into.
Hey, buddy. Hey!
light's green, you idiot.
you got a staring problem, mate? What the fuck you looking at?
Yeah, fuckin' get me.
go get him.
and do what?
let him know who's king.
come on, come outside.
I'll deck ya, mate. Come outside.
come on, idiot. Come outside.
Wha-hey-hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, brother.
just relax, man. I was just gonna have a chat to him, alright?
just chill, bro.
fuck this, man.
fuck out of here, man!
how did that feel? Huh?
did you get a little stiffy? Yeah?
bit of fun, huh?
I'll give you 100 bucks.
come on!
I'll give you 100 bucks. -Honey, people are watching.
200 bucks.
would you fuckin' motivate your girlfriend?
mate, just let her alone. -Yeah?
OK, open up. 200 bucks.
alright. That's the way.
awesome!
fuckin' rich!
Hey, so Nicole's a sweetie.
Where'd you find her?
found her at school.
where are you going? -What?
did you wash your hands?
no.
you had your hands on your cock.
your hands go anywhere near your arse or your cock, you wash them after.
jeez. Come on.
bit of soap.
Yeah. Get a lather going.
rinse.
alright, that's enough.
now stick them under there.
I'm invisible. These things never see me.
no-one's invisible, mate.
you've got to get right up in there.
there you go.
excuse me.
the bill.
Roache said just pull your head in.
right? You all got to pull your heads in.
sir, there's no smoking in here.
sorry. Just doing it a little bit.
they're not watching you.
can't you cut 'em in?
just give 'em a drink.
it's the Armed Robbery Squad, mate. They don't do business.
Roache just says pull your heads in and it'll all go away.
right?
sir, you cannot smoke in here. -Oh, for fuck's sake.
alright. That's alright. We're done here. It's good.
mum! I'm going home.
Oh, darling, are you alright to drive? You're not drunk, are you?
no, I'm OK. I'm fine.
come and give us a kiss.
do you ever stop, mate?
seriously, every time I see you you're chopping in.
why don't you try going to sleep for once in your life?
Bazza, I sleep like a baby.
want some?
Oh, no, she's alright.
says you.
Yeah. Don't trample her freedom, mate.
sweetheart, would you like some?
we're here having a nice night and you have to do your own thing.
well, fuckin' avert your eyes.
J, can you go and get some drinks?
can you get Bazza a really big one? Loosen him up just a little bit.
well...
are you alright, love?
OK, tell 'em, tell 'em. -I'm alright.
are you sure?
guess who am I?
uncle Pope.
do you know me? -Yeah, you're Julia's kid.
better be cleaning that up in there.
ruined my surprise.
they're not actually gonna shoot ya.
you know that, don't you?
bet that's what they said to Mickey and Petey...Petey Speed as well.
mate, if they had anything on us, they would be using it.
but they don't, so then all they can do is sit in a car outside my fucking house.
yeah...
they've got bigger fish to fry.
the Armed Rob's getting shut down.
half those guys will get shuffled over to Major Crime Squad.
rest will go, you know, wherever.
and their whole club will fall to bits.
all they can try and do now is get something over on us.
they got something over on you.
Yeah, they made you run.
you're a fuck.
you don't have them out there telling people they want to knock ya.
Baz, we should go. -Yeah, in a minute, babe.
it's late. We should go. Charlie's babysitting.
Yeah, well, I'm just talking.
call Charlie.
I'll pay her 1, 000 bucks if she stays over the night.
Yeah, nine grand a pop's as good as it gets now.
I don't know that you've got 1, 000 bucks to give the babysitter.
Yeah. True. That's not untrue.
Hey, hey. Can you hear that?
what?
fuckin' listen.
what is it, hon?
mongrel!
kids, cut it out.
get off him, hon.
Andrew's got my arm! Argh!
where are you going? -Supermarket.
what to get?
not much.
what?
I'm gonna meet Pope.
how long's that car gonna stay parked outside our house?
this is what I'm gonna go meet him about.
it's been there for a week.
Yeah, well, this is what I'm gonna go and meet him about, aren't I?
can you not pinch my arse every five seconds?
Oh, but I can't help it. I just...I love it!
see ya.
get milk.
here, mate.
take that. That's my number.
that'll be my number for the next week or so and then I'll change it every week.
right. That's your split.
it's bullshit.
sorry, love. -Excuse me.
mate, I don't know what you're thinking about your future and that but I'm about done with this shit.
I need some sort of change.
the stock market's working.
you know that 20 grand I put in there is 60 now?
see, you get a foot in that door, there's serious money to be made, you know?
I don't know anything about the stock market, mate.
so what? Neither did I.
doesn't matter.
you get the paper, you learn it.
it doesn't matter. Our game, it's over, mate.
it's getting too hard. It's a fucking joke.
you know, Craig's making a fucking fortune with the drug thing.
you saw the house he's bought.
I don't know I got that in me.
it's grubby.
you know? Grubby business.
the stock market, mate.
there's a resources boom.
I'll get you started. I'll set you an account up and you're away.
Yeah, I...mate, I'm...
I don't have a computer.
don't need a computer.
well, I don't know what I'm gonna do. What...
well...... either do I, is what I'm saying.
but every day's a new day is what I'm also saying.
what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Aw, fuck.
here we go.
Oh, shit, guys, you just missed him.
that's alright. I like you better.
he's got a gun!
you spoken to Cath? -I gotta go, hon.
it's OK to cry, honey.
honey, come here.
dogs!
fuck.
fuck! -Hey, come on, baby.
calm down. Come here. Come on.
it can't happen, Nick.
you're at school. You're in Year 12:
he really needs somewhere, Mum. There's things going on.
what things? -Things.
I don't know. It'd just be for a while.
you're still at school, Nick.
you're probably gonna make a mess of it as it is.
and you shouldn't be asking me this right in front of J.
Why? 'Cause you don't want him to see what a bitch you are?
Hey, hey, hey, come on.
look, one of J's friends got shot by the cops today, and he's dead, OK?
and I don't think it would be that big a deal to let him stay here.
I didn't know him too well.
where was this?
Um...Prahran, I think.
that was on the news.
I didn't know him too well. It was... it was just a shock and everything.
well, uh, I mean, can we do anything?
I mean, do you want a drink or...?
no, thanks.
so maybe you can think about that.
# I'm lying alone with my head on the phone #
# Thinking of you till it hurts #
# I know you hurt too but what else can we do #
# Tormented and torn apart #
# I wish I could carry your smile in my heart #
# For times when my life seems so low #
# It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring #
# When today doesn't really know #
# Doesn't really know #
# I'm all out of love I'm so lost without you #
# I know you were right Believing for so long #
# I'm all out of love What am I without you? #
# I can't be too late #
# To say that I was so wrong #
# I want you to come back and carry me home #
# Away from these long, lonely nights #
# I'm reaching for you Are you feeling it too? #
# Does the feeling seem oh, so right? #
# And what would you say If I called on you now? #
# And said that I can't hold on...#
she's beautiful, mate.
you know why your mum and I didn't talk for so long?
no.
we had a fight...about...
you know the card game 500?
she reckoned you can play the joker whenever you want in a no-trumps hand.
she was drunk. I was drunk too, but I was right.
so look what happens.
years go by and then she's gone.
and I lose my only daughter...
...'cause you can't play the joker whenever you want in a no-trumps hand.
and I don't get to see you for years.
that made me real sad.
but I'm getting to see you now.
all the time.
OK. Stand up. Let's have a look at you.
sweet!
how do I look? -You look good.
correct.
beautiful boy.
Where'd you get that suit? What's that suit?
it's a suit.
what, do you think it looks good on you?
what?
looks gay. Are you gay?
fuck off, will you?
it's a serious question.
I don't care if you're gay or if you're not gay, you know?
it's alright if you are, mate.
I just want you to tell me about it, you know?
I don't care whether you're gay or you're not gay.
I just want you to talk to me about it, you know?
making yourself a drink?
Yep. -What is it?
it's a bourbon and coke.
bourbon and coke's not a very gay drink, mate.
I think...look, if you're a gay man, if you are, and you want to make yourself a gay drink, just go ahead and make yourself a gay drink.
you know what I mean? That's what I'm talking about, mate.
I just want you to tell me things.
you know, it just kills me to see you living a lie.
look, will you fuck off? Seriously.
what do you think we should do?
I think we should be there for Cath and the family and that.
what are you gonna do, Darren?
it's wrong and all that but, you know...
you know, if Baz was still here right now and we'd just been to your funeral, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
cause he'd have already done something about it.
if you don't want to do anything because you're scared...
is it because you're scared?
it's alright if you are.
I just want you to tell me about it.
just talk to me.
Where's Craig? -I don't know.
I need a favour, alright?
you're good with cars, yeah?
Yeah. -OK.
you go get me a Commodore or something like that and bring it to Darren's place.
alright?
at, uh, 2am.
how come?
cause I told you to.
where is it?
it's parked around back. It's a white Commodore.
what are you doing that for? What are you doing that now for?
what makes you think that's a good idea to do that now?
the bag. Get the bag.
Oh, and hey, anyone calls while we're out, you tell them Darren's in the shower.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
see you out there, mate.
great. Thanks, Sergeant.
Richmond 49, do you copy?
49 Richmond, we copy.
49, what's your current position?
we're heading west on Bridge Road towards Church.
49, Boroondara's units are all tied up at present.
can you head over to 36 Darcy Street In Hawthorn?
a Mrs Birnie of that address has reported a white Commodore sedan in the middle of the road.
says it looks stolen. Windows are smashed.
Roger. We'll give it a look.
Oh, this looks like it. -Yep.
turn around, pig cunt.
Darren?
Darren, what happened? -Go to sleep.
should I go home?
hello.
Oh, he's stretched out that one.
and he's asking the question.
a little shrug of the shoulders, uh...
he obviously doesn't know.
and I think that's out!
Yes, he lifts his foot to get it back and I think the ball is off...
Hey! Hey.
this Sri Lankan guy here, what's his name?
It's...Muralitharan?
what? -Muralitharan.
Yeah. He's funny.
Where's Craig?
Oh, I don't know.
Hey, who cuts your hair?
Nicky.
yeah?
do you think maybe she'd cut my hair if I asked her?
maybe.
where are you going? -Just gonna go to my room.
listen, you know if you ever want to talk about anything or anything, I'm there, right?
I mean, if you need help with anything or whatever, I'd like to do that for you.
Yeah. Right, OK.
G'day, Josh.
I'm Detective Senior Sergeant Leckie.
this is Detective Norris.
mr Harrop here's from the Department of Human Services.
it's a requirement under the law when questioning anybody under the age of 18 that they be accompanied by a guardian or legal representative.
in the absence of such a person, a department officer such as John here must be present.
I must also advise you you're under no obligation to say anything at this point in time but anything you do say can be used as evidence in any later court appearances.
do you understand? -Yeah.
OK. This shouldn't take too long.
I've already been here for hours.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
it's been a big day, as I'm sure you can understand.
please state your full name.
joshua Daniel Cody.
and do you know why you're here, Josh?
I wouldn't have a clue.
right, well, last night, two police officers were shot dead investigating a stolen car in Hawthorn.
can you tell me where you were last night?
I was at home. -What's the address there?
17 Harding Street, Ivanhoe.
OK. What were you doing at home last night, Josh?
just watching TV:
were your uncles at that address with you all night last night?
they were home, but I fell asleep pretty early so I wouldn't have a clue, really, what they were up to.
think they might've just been watching TV, sort of thing.
they were watching TV with you?
they came in at some point but by that point I was already half asleep, so...
what were you watching?
I think it was that 'Funniest Home Videos'.
I was pretty much just having a nap on the couch.
and so, at some point, all three of your uncles came into the room?
is that right, or...or just one of them, or...or maybe two?
can you tell me exactly who was there?
I can't really tell you. I was... I was that tired that I only remember there were people around but, you know, I can't say who exactly is...
basically I had my eyes shut, sort of thing.
you don't remember who you heard?
the reason...the reason I was so sleepy is 'cause I'd smoked some marijuana and...you know, I was knocked out... sort of thing.
I didn't want to have to tell you guys that.
do you remember where you were when you heard the news of Barry Brown's death?
I was home.
and how did the family take that news?
I...I imagine Craig was pretty upset.
Yeah, he was sad.
sad in what way?
he was crying.
you actually physically saw him crying? What did you see?
his face was red, he had... water coming out of his eyes and he was rubbing them.
how was he rubbing his eyes?
um, just...
and, uh, what's taken place after that?
has he said anything or made any comments that you can recall?
Oh, look, I've been smoking a fair bit lately so my memory's pretty fucked.
but... don't know, I don't think so.
is there anything else you'd like to add in regard to these matters we've discussed here today?
no.
OK, we'll suspend the interview right there.
uh, Detective Norris and I will be back in a tick.
you want a drink or anything?
no.
orange juice or something? -No, thanks.
have you forgotten about Baz, have you?
who's been looking after you? Who's been giving you money?
huh? Me and Baz have. That's who.
and what does Craig give you?
he's making a fortune. How much does he give you?
Craig bought me my flat.
Nuh.
Nuh. You don't own it.
he just lets you live there.
what is it you think you've done for Baz?
you think Baz gives two hoots for what you've gone and done?
Thanks, love.
can we have the bill, please? -Sure.
he's dead.
I know you care, honey.
but don't you go thinking you care in a special way like nobody else does.
Craig's here.
Hey.
maybe you should start taking your pills again.
what the fuck? Hey?
what were they doing there so quick?
they know who Baz's friends are.
fuck! -Keep your voice down.
mate, if they knew something, we'd still be in there.
they want to talk to you too, hon.
you should call Ezra and take yourself in tomorrow.
I'm not going in there. Are you fucking nuts?
if you don't, they'll think you've got something to hide.
I fucking do! I'm not going in there.
they'll come looking for you if you don't, sweetheart.
calm down.
fuck.
Where's J?
where is J?
is he still in there? -I don't know.
what's he saying?
I don't know, OK? Calm down, Craig.
if he's not talking, what are they still talking about?
where is he? -How the fuck should I know?
like I'm supposed to know where he is.
Oh, fuck.
um, could I help?
Yeah, you could get the, um, knives and forks.
so how was your day today?
it was OK.
how was yours?
it was good.
dinner's ready.
you can take those.
how was your friend's...funeral?
it was OK, you know. Sad and everything.
Yeah. We saw it on the news.
Hey, buddy. Mwah!
where have you been, Nicole?
detention. I told you.
no, you didn't. -Yeah, I did.
you had to sign that form. -I signed the form.
Oh, yeah.
well, then, get angry at him for not telling you.
I can't be having to tell you everything all the time...
J. Are you in there?
Yep.
your uncle's at the door.
I'm coming.
What'd you let me fall asleep for?
Mmm, I fell asleep.
Hey, um, we gotta go.
alright.
it was nice to meet you.
see you. -Hey, Daz.
I do a lot for you, Nick.
you're still at school and you're allowed to have your boyfriend sleep over.
that's a...big thing for me.
where are we going?
to see our lawyer.
this is really fucking important, mate.
I need to know word for word. You know?
they just kept asking me a couple of questions.
I said, I don't know, and then they let me go.
well, what were you doing in there so long?
nothing. They just sat me in there with no-one coming in or anything.
that's good. That's OK.
now, I want you to listen very carefully.
from now on, mate, you don't say anything, and that means nothing at all.
you don't say, I don't know. You don't say, I was sleeping.
you just refuse to answer any of their questions, OK?
by law, these cunts can't make you say anything.
you don't even have to give your name, OK?
now, this is very important.
don't let them push you around.
you just sit there in silence, at least, you know, till I get there.
this goes for you with your girlfriend too. What's her name?
Nicole. -Cole?
Nicole. -Nicole.
this goes for you with Nicole too.
now, there's certain things you just don't...you don't talk to girls about, you know?
it doesn't matter how special they are or what you have and haven't done.
girls, they get frightened.
they...they natter. They can't help it.
it's just the way the world is.
there's not really much to understand about this except... you shut up.
are you clear with all that, honey?
Yep.
there's nothing to worry about.
Hey, do you want a cold drink?
I've got lots of different kinds of drinks.
Hey, mate. Um, just that petrol.
number two, mate? $44: 50:
Thanks, mate. -Thanks.
fuckin' monster!
it's a nice gun, Rich. -Yeah.
can we go hunting? -Yeah, maybe, mate.
I've got a few things I gotta do.
look, can you just not blow holes in me silo?
it's fucked. It's written off.
so how long were you wanting to stay?
and where's Kelly?
we split up, mate. Ages ago.
don't worry.
you know, it's mutual and everything, so... it's for the best.
fuckin' piece of shit!
you OK, mate?
what's with the scanner?
I'll fight through, mate. You know?
I'll fight through.
look, um, I'm just thinking it's only fair if you're gonna be hanging here for a while, it's only fair you tell us what this is about.
is that fair?
I don't know what's going on, Rich.
I don't know what's going on, mate.
can you hear that? -Hear what?
I can hear your fuckin' dogs.
what's going on?
I don't know. I don't know.
tell him he can't stay here.
I can't tell him nothin', love. Just...
cunt motherfuckers!
what's that, Rich? What's that?
I don't know. What is it, mate? -It's a bug!
there's a fucking bug on your house.
I don't know about it.
how can there be a bug on your house 24 hours after I told you I'm coming, huh?
they're probably bugging your phone, mate.
I don't know. I'm not lying to you.
fuck.
what am I gonna do now, mate?
I don't know, mate. Maybe it's just best you leave, eh?
Yeah. OK. Alright.
Yeah, I gotta go, OK?
I'll go.
I'll go, yeah?
you'll be alright, mate. -Yeah.
did I bring anything else?
shit.
what did you tell her?
I said you might be there or you might not.
that's the way. Spin it round.
well, I reckon there's more chance of me not being there at the moment.
Oh, well, she'll get over it.
is it up there somewhere? Yeah.
G'day, mate.
Craig Cody's gone, mate.
Oh, what do you mean?
we've had to drop him.
he found the listening device In Bendigo.
he sounded unhinged so they went in to apprehend him.
he lost the plot. Had to drop him.
why didn't anyone call me? I would've got the soggies up there.
there was no time for that, mate. He just lost the plot.
alright, give me a sec to think.
I'm having trouble trying to find my positive spin.
I'm usually very good at it.
usually it's right there and I can just have it.
but I'm having trouble finding it now.
I don't know why.
people just don't listen, do they?
you know, if you hadn't have got in his ear, Mum, about turning himself in, there'd be none of this shit, none of this carry-on.
did you think about that? Did you?
fuckin' gone and spooked him.
now look what's fuckin' happened.
stop hitting me! I didn't kill him.
I thought that's what we did.
we take it out on whoever turns up.
don't, alright?
leave her alone. I'm alright, J.
just...just relax.
come here, mate. Don't you touch him.
come here. Relax.
come here, you little... Don't you touch him!
G'day, Josh. I've got some bad news, mate.
Yeah, he knows the bad news.
is everything OK here?
Yeah. Everything's great.
you alright, mate?
he's fine, Mr Leckie.
Josh, I'd like you to come down to St Kilda Road with me, if that's OK.
Hey, what's he done? Tell me. I'll make sure he gets disciplined.
will you come with me, Josh?
what do you want to talk to him about? Talk to me about it.
we'll speak to you again at a later time when we're ready.
I might, um...might have some information for you about those two murdered police.
I've been asking around a bit and there's a few theories floating around but I don't know if any of them are true or not but might be able to help you with your investigations.
Oh, thanks for that.
will you come with me, Josh?
you go, love.
I'll call Ezra.
go put your shoes on.
I'm not currently in a position to discuss what happened today but I can arrange for counselling services to visit, should you require any.
hope you find the killers.
Yeah, so do I.
you know you're not alone, right?
we'll get you through this, mate.
OK?
this is a record of interview between
detective Senior Sergeant Nathan Leckie and Joshua Daniel Cody.
present is solicitor Ezra White.
now, I'll remind you again, Josh.
you're under no obligation to say anything at this point in time but anything you do say can be used as evidence in any future court appearances.
you understand that? Yes, he understands that.
OK.
OK, now, picking up where we left off when we last spoke, you were telling us how upset your uncles were over the death of Barry Brown.
can you remember what was said or any...any comments that were made at that time exactly?
Josh, has Mr White provided you with advice in respect to how you should conduct yourself in this interview today?
Yes, he'll be remaining mute.
OK, I can appreciate you've been advised not to say anything to me, but the sooner you help us with our inquiries, the sooner we can scratch you off the list and move onto a different line.
you do understand that, don't you?
nothing else you want to say at this point?
there wasn't a good feeling in the room.
Leckie was running the whole
yesterday you were very helpful routine.
that was probably for my benefit.
but I don't know.
look, he's just a kid. Kids are stupid, they're weak.
he may think he's doing the right thing but really, you know, his foot's covered in dog shit and he's got it stuck right in his mouth.
I'm pretty surprised you let him get anywhere near to you, to be honest.
I told you to go get that car. No, you didn't.
I told you to go get the car. No, you didn't!
you never fuckin' mentioned it to me once, Pope!
I don't want to hear this.
you've just gotta be worried about what he's doing.
he's a big kid. He can look after himself.
can he, now? Can he handle police?
it's a totally different kettle of fish.
what should we do?
I'd start by keeping an eagle eye on him, that's for sure.
where is he now?
he's in his room with his girlfriend.
is he? What's she doing here?
Really?
Yeah, well, we'll do it anyway.
Yeah, cool.
OK. Well, call me back.
is he talking to her?
how should I know?
mate, I can't help you with the how part.
you've just gotta be looking out for this shit, you know?
what? So he's my responsibility now?
I'll call you tomorrow.
this is bullshit.
well, you know I'm not fucking telling them anything.
mate, the cops are serious about this thing, J.
and they're onto you like a rash.
so if you just stick close by, everyone will keep calm.
what am I supposed to do? How the fuck should I know?
go in your room and do some colouring in.
I've gotta go get him. Yeah.
Hey, J, Danielle wants to... Can you give us a minute here?
Why? What's going on? Don't be a stickybeak. Just...
Danielle just wants to talk to you for a sec.
I'll talk to her in a minute.
look, mate, I don't know if you want to hear this or not but...
...I would think pretty hard about giving her the flick.
I don't know what you have or you haven't...
haven't been telling her anything.
life will be easier if you just cut her loose, J.
believe me.
she shouldn't be hanging around here right now.
this has got nothing to do with me.
mate, everything has got to do with everyone.
don't you fucking understand that?
do you understand that, J?
J, do... Yes!
thank you.
maybe it's just for a little while.
I just need some space and that.
for what?
just some things I gotta do.
do you love me?
do you love me?
Yeah.
Why?
cause you're nice.
please don't get upset, Nicky.
G'day, Josh.
Oh, what the fuck...
we need to talk, mate.
no, we don't.
are you alright? She's fine.
am i, fuckwit?
Oh, come on, where are you going, Nicky?
can you just go away?
we can either talk in here or outside.
there's nothing to talk about. I will arrest you if I have to.
what for? Under-age drinking.
Oh, give me a fuckin' break.
you want me to make a scene?
Hey. is J here?
no, J, he's...he's gone down to the shops.
but, um, come in. Come and wait for him if you want. He won't be long.
have a seat.
did he say how long he'd be?
uh...no, he won't be long.
where you been tonight?
just down at the Zanoni.
Zanoni, huh?
Oh, yeah.
anyone there you know?
talk to anyone you know?
there was nobody there that I know.
Oh, well, I was about to have a shot but, uh...
you want some?
what is it?
Oh, it's fun.
no, she's just going home.
it's fun.
have some.
go ahead. Come on.
put your arm out.
come on.
there you go. That's it.
now, there we go.
there we go.
there we go.
you been talking to the cops?
what?
about what?
about anything.
Nuh. It's none of my business.
Yeah, yeah, it's your business, isn't it?
when you're in love with someone and you're whispering sweet nothings in their ears.
hey? Look at me. Look at me.
I got a call from someone who told me that you've been talking to the cops.
what cops?
Oh, down at Zanoni's.
you can tell me.
you been talking to the cops?
come here.
come here, baby.
fuck. Pope.
Pope, what the fuck you doing?
what the fuck you doing, Pope?
Pope, what are you doing?
Pope!
Pope!
Pope, what are you doing?
please, Pope, stop it, please.
Andrew, please.
Oh, fuck, Pope, what are you doing?
shit, man.
what the fuck?
you've gone and done it again, haven't you, Darren?
you've smoked yourself silly.
you think something's going on.
why'd you bring me here?
for your safety.
you want a sip of my drink?
what's the matter?
are you scared?
scared of me?
that can't feel too fuckin' good.
bananas.
let's go sit outside for a bit, eh?
just you and me.
you know what the bush is about?
it's about massive trees that've been standing there for thousands of years and bugs that'll be dead before the minute's out.
it's big trees and pissy little bugs.
and everything knows its place in the scheme of things.
everything...Everything sits in the order somewhere.
things survive because they're strong and...everything reaches an understanding.
but not everything survives because it's strong.
some creatures are weak, but they survive because they've been protected by the strong, for one reason or another.
you may think that because of the circles that you move in or whatever that you're one of the strong creatures.
but you're not. You're one of the weak ones.
that's nothing against you. You're just weak because you're young.
but you've survived because you've been protected by the strong.
but they're not strong anymore.
and they're certainly not able to protect you.
we're here because we know who you are and we know what you've done.
now, I know you feel like you're in a tough situation.
but you have an out.
there's nothing your uncles can do to squirm out of this one.
Craig's learnt that the hard way.
but you're not like that. We can see that.
and you know that.
now, I know they're saying to you that talking to me is betraying the family.
but they've betrayed you.
the fact that you're talking to me, the fact that you've been left to deal with us...
...is all the proof that you need.
and you're in danger.
don't be confused about that.
I think you know.
and I think you know that I can help you.
but I can't keep offering. You've got to decide.
you've got to work out where you fit.
I don't know why you're telling me all of this.
Yes, you do.
OK, we're going home.
Justin, we're leaving, mate.
you know, you can say what you like about Craig, but at least he was clean.
Hi, sweetie. Where you been?
uh, just at Nicky's house.
Oh, yeah?
how is she?
Yeah, she's OK.
Hey. Yeah, it's me.
he's here. He's just walked in.
fuck. Calm down, Darren.
what's wrong, hon?
my fuckin' car keys.
where the FUCK are my car keys?
give us yours, mate. I'm going to take your car.
what's that girl's...Where...That girl...
you know the girl, what's her address?
the fuck... What's wrong?
just tell me what's her fuckin' address?
you went there the other day, mate.
Yeah, and I fuckin' forgot, didn't I?
just tell me, what's her fuckin' address?
sorry.
Nicky's not here, J.
is everything alright?
Yeah.
was she with you last night?
Yeah, I think she went to stay at Danielle's place.
I'm just gonna use the toilet, if that's OK.
Yeah, sure. Fine.
Darren? J, you've got to get out.
Pope just left here in a bad way and he's heading over there.
well, how does he know where I am?
I don't know. Just get out, alright, man? You've gotta get out, alright?
just go, OK?
OK?
OK.
Hey, Gus, um, would you be able to give me a lift somewhere, please?
mate, I've got a shitload of work to do here. I'm sorry, mate.
it's just that I'm a bit late and it's down near the shops and that.
alright, just give us a moment.
you're gonna have to turn that off, buddy.
Yep, we're gonna go for a ride.
here, whack that on.
OK, this is the stuff.
this Vietnamese place in Russell Street makes this.
real chilli sauce. Smell that.
don't suck it in.
right, half a teaspoon of that, OK?
keep the noodles on the stock for another minute or so and then pull them off.
or just taste them. You'll know when they're ready.
then chuck the rest of the stuff in. You should be right.
Yep. Do I keep stirring?
Yeah. Why not?
see you later. Yep. See ya.
Ezra says don't get your hopes up about the committal.
but he said he...
. there were strings he could pull.
they're all pulled.
how you keeping, hon?
well, hold on, what did he say about getting a bail application in?
is he on this thing or what?
Darren, honey.
say something.
speak to her.
what's going on in here?
will you speak to Mum, you fuckin' sook?
What'd Ez say about whomping the bail application in?
what do you think he said?
it's been whomped. You're not getting bail.
what on earth made you think you were gonna get bail?
what do you think you're in here for?
don't fuckin' start up again, Mum. Hey!
if you let anything happen to him in here...
what?
what are you gonna do?
huh?
what are you gonna do, Mum?
Darren?
baby.
better do something.
Hi. Hello.
we gotta do something about J.
what do you mean?
we gotta do something about J.
he's got to go.
he's in witness protection, Janine.
you know what witness protection means.
here's the address of where he's staying.
get in the car.
you really want to go down this path? We're still working on this.
where did you get this?
I've been around a long time, sweetie.
j's turned and he's not coming back.
even if the boys get off,
I won't be seeing J again.
and I don't want Darren to rot in that jail.
if my boys go down, that's it.
I got no-one left.
j's gone, whatever happens.
we got to set up a meeting. Is your office safe?
look, I know you got a problem, Janine.
but I don't see how this mess your boys are in has got anything to do with me.
so if you've called me in here to see if there's some strings I can pull, then you're way off course.
is that what this is about?
Hey, Randall, before you go on, this boy who's currently being looked after
tell me if you agree with this
this boy who's being looked after, he knows who you are.
and you know how these things go.
they're gonna ask him all sorts of questions about everything he's ever seen or done.
everyone he's ever met.
the whole shemozzle.
and you've done some bad things, sweetie.
haven't you?
I want this part to be clear.
this is not about you doing me a favour or...me blackmailing you, anything like that.
it's just a bad situation for everyone.
Ezra's got the address.
it shouldn't be too hard to set up a raid on the house.
there'd be reasonable grounds, what with all the strange activity, the comings and goings day and night.
one of the neighbours might've seen a gun or something.
this is your area of expertise.
I'm not trying to tell you how to suck eggs.
what do you think?
I really don't see how anything can be done, Janine.
Randall...
...I feel sick about this.
I'm not happy at all, not one little bit.
but we do what we have to do. We do what we must.
just because we don't want to do something doesn't mean it can't be done.
Hey!
they're cops.
Jesus Christ, what the fuck are cops doing here?
who says they're cops?
cause they're wearing fucking flak jackets, it makes them cops?
who else would it be? I don't fuckin' know.
they're wearing flak jackets with fuckin' 'Police' written on them.
so what do we do? We surrender. There's six of them.
I'm not taking them head-on, mate. They're fuckin' cops!
I don't care who they are, mate. I'm not fighting a war.
I'm not fighting a war over some fuckwit kid!
fuck that! I'll shoot him myself.
what are we gonna do?
I don't fuckin' know what we're gonna do. What are you gonna do?
that's it. I'm done.
what?
Oh...Fuck!
police! Open up!
open the fucking door! Open the door or we'll bust it down.
we're witness protection. Fuck.
don't fuck around. Open it now!
alright. OK. OK. Oh, fuck.
shit.
you'd think the executives at that station, they need a new host for their show, they could find someone with straighter teeth.
I don't mind his personality but his mouth's so off-putting.
Oh, my goodness.
I need to talk to you.
what you doing here? Is there anyone inside?
just my neighbour Helen, love.
I wanna get Pope out of jail.
I can't live like this.
of course, dear.
I want to set up a meeting with Ezra and that barrister from the committal.
OK. Of course.
I don't trust Ezra so I'm not going to anyone's house.
it has to be somewhere public.
but it also has to be somewhere no-one we know would go.
OK, honey. OK.
mate, if you really want to help the boys, coming home is the thing to do.
I'm not coming home. I'm not safe there.
Yes, you are, dear.
no, I'm not.
I'm not safe in witness protection either, but I'd rather take my chances there.
you'll be safe at home, honey.
you can't promise me that.
I can. I can.
I'm not coming home. I'm going back there.
I'm just letting you all know that I'm here to help.
I think J's made his position clear.
where that leaves us now is to decide how best to proceed, given the brave offer of assistance he's made.
you know, this thing's going to trial with or without J, that's a given.
what we want is to win it.
you know what I liked about the committal hearing?
despite the fact that we've been ordered to stand trial, of course.
but what I liked about the committal was that for the most part, their case looked pretty flimsy to me.
largely dependent on witness testimony that shouldn't be too hard to discredit, I wouldn't have thought.
and if the committal's any indicator, then J here's their star witness.
without him, they'll need to strengthen their brief, which they will do with something else.
personally, I'd rather tackle the evidence I saw at the committal than any rejigged brief they come up with should J suddenly decide to leave.
you know what I mean?
so I think we should just get into it.
there's a bunch of things we'll need to go through...
come with me.
where have you been? Hiding.
you shouldn't have left the house. Where did you go?
I was hiding.
it was the Drug Squad who raided the house today.
OK? They'd been told something funny was going on here.
it was just a fuckin' mix-up.
now, you're not in any danger, alright?
I need you to understand that.
OK? OK.
did anybody see you out there today?
no.
OK.
you alright?
I'm fine.
I think courtrooms make everyone feel a little bit nervous.
you ready?
coming down.
your girlfriend, Nicole, died from a heroin overdose.
is this true? Yes.
and is it true you believe your uncles were responsible for this?
Yes. How?
they injected her.
maybe don't rush your answers.
the more hesitant you are, the more uncertain you'll appear, OK?
how's he gonna remember all this?
he doesn't need to. It's better if he doesn't.
we don't want him reciting lines.
he just needs to get into the swing of it, wrap his head around the flavour of it.
do you understand that, J?
so you're saying they forcibly injected her with what's known as a 'hot shot'.
Yes.
did you see them do it? No.
was she known to you to be a user of heroin?
sometimes, yeah.
was she? This is me talking now.
no.
then say no. You don't need to lie.
was there any reason why on this particular night she might have wanted to use heroin?
maybe.
why maybe?
I broke up with her.
that night? Yeah.
so to some extent you feel responsible for Nicole's death.
I don't know, maybe to an extent.
but you want your uncles put away for it, even though you didn't see them do it and she was justifiably upset on this night because you had ended the relationship.
you're looking for someone to blame for something you feel responsible for.
would you agree with that? Blah, blah, blah.
it's good.
you feel OK? You OK, sweetheart?
Yeah, I'm fine. Can you go grab us a drink or something?
of course.
there must be a drink machine around here somewhere.
have you worked out where you fit?
that's all due to this trauma.
now, my family's been dragged through the mud over this.
and that kind of action plays heavy on your mind.
you know, the police go off on a tangent, fly off the handle, and...wee young kid like J gets the idea you can't even trust the law to work properly.
the justice system, yeah?
um, OK.
alright. Maybe that's enough of that.
uh, Andrew, I was hoping to get some shots of you and Darren reacting to the news of your acquittal on the TV.
what?
so we'd shoot you guys watching the TV
like you're watching a news report of yourselves, celebrating.
no, I'm not doing that. I'm not a fuckin' monkey.
can I dial out from here?
no, these might be different. They're OK? Alright.
don't know that we need that, do we?
Hi.
I just want you to know I don't bear you any ill will, Mr Leckie.
I really don't.
you were just doing your job.
I hope you catch the people who did that terrible thing.
if you're as smart as I think you are, you'd know to walk right on by me
like we've never seen each other before in our lives, and you'd know to feel lucky.
you'll come unstuck.
I've got a feeling about it.
I think you do too.
I reckon you probably carry that feeling around with you every second of the day.
but I don't, Nathan.
Hey, Grandma.
I was wondering when I'd see you again.
been missing ya.
you OK?
Yeah, I'm OK.
um, is it OK if I move back here?
I don't really know where else to go.
course.
you want food? You look Biafran.
no, thanks.
I think I want to go lie down for a bit.
you don't want to eat? Pope's cookin'.
no, thanks.
OK, sweetie.
your room's still there.
I've missed you.
say hi to the guys.
you know what I mean? It doesn't do anything.
doesn't cook anything, you know.
Hey.
Hey, mate.
you hungry?
no. I just came out to say hi.
I'm gonna go lie down for a bit.
alright, mate.
it's a crazy fuckin' world.

did you see that gorgeous thing at the bar, sitting all by his lonesome?
how could we not, what with you flirting like a cheap whore?
honey, I may be cheap， I ain't no whore.
now, now, Pinocchio. We know what happens to little boys who tell lies.
Ooh! - Oh, please. Enough already.
come in.
well, hello.
your first time?
Yeah.
are you married?
divorced.
when did you know?
in my first year of high school, my father made me play football.
coach told me to line up center, bend over and grab the ball.
Donnie Walsh was the quarterback.
he walked up behind me, put his hand on my ass for the snap.
I was in heaven.
it's honestly all been downhill from then on.
Oh, shit.
don't worry. Just roll down the window, and let me do the talking.
you boys having some fun?
no, Officer. We're actually just talking about playing high school football.
Yeah, right.
no, really. And you look like you've played with a few balls in your time.
whoa, whoa, whoa! - Show me your hands.
everything's cool, everything's cool! - Why are you so angry?
do you wanna talk about it? - I'm gonna count to three. One.
big man with your big gun! - Two.
shut up and do what he says! Put your hands up!
three! - Wait!
you pull that trigger, it's murder one.
I'm with the D. A.'s office. Jury will convict you in five seconds.
you'll spend the next 50 years in a jail cell with some guy...that wants to play cops and robbers with you every night.
I'm sure the D. A.'s office would love to know about one of their own getting sucked off in a parking lot.
and I'm sure Internal Affairs would love to hear about one of their own drawing his weapon and threatening two unarmed civilians.
so let's just both forget about this little misunderstanding.
what do you say?
don't let me catch you in this parking lot again.
okay.
are you crazy?
it's not funny. - Yes, it's so...
it's not funny!
drawing his weapon and threatening two unarmed civilians.
Oh, my God. I thought he was gonna kill us.
Oh, my God! What is your name?
paul Fleiger. You?
Rudy Donatello. Nice to meet you.
nice to meet you, Mr. Donatello.
what now?
he was kind of cute too.
I'm just staying here till they, uh, finish my place in Malibu.
uh - Okay.
well, wait, wait.
just- Here.
give me a call.
are you sure that's what you want?
Hey! What do you want?
you got a kid, right?
Yeah. What about him?
Yeah, yeah. I figured this must be his.
you should turn that down. - What?
loud music ain't good for kids. It hurts their ears.
are you some expert on parenting now? - No, but...
then you know what? Mind your own business, you cock-sucking motherfucker.
you're six days late.
twelve dollars? What are you? A comedian?
things have been a bit slow. I'll get it to you by tomorrow, I promise.
well, tomorrow's not today! - Tomorrow is not today.
what is this? Some sort of existential philosophy we're getting now?
you don't have the money by tomorrow, I'm locking you out!
you know, instead of bleeding me dry， You could do something about the noise in there!
it's like this morning, noon and night!
or at least ask her to close the door!
Geez!
lady, close your door!
Jesus!
your mommy didn't come home at all last night?
no?
no idea where she might be, huh?
can you talk?
Oh, good.

uh, can I tell Mr. Fleiger what this is regarding?
come on. Don't be a Nosy Nellie. Just put Paul on the phone for me, please.
I'll let him know you're on the line - I gotta get something to eat.
this is not a good time to be hitting me up for money, believe me.
look, a quarter, a dime. - Larry, don't get- Larry!
Jesus Christ, Larry! This is not a good time, I said already!
now beat it， or I'll bust your face in two!
Oh, you crazy faggot! - Get...
it's okay. It's okay.
Hello? Mr. Donatello?
hello. Yeah, I'm here.
I'm afrad I don't have Mr. Fleger. - You don't have him?
what is that? Code talk for he's there, but he don't wanna talk to me?
would you like to leave him a message?
no, I would not like to leave a message. I would like to talk to him.
look, if you'd like to leave him a message， I'll be happy to pass it along for you.
lady, are you deaf? I already said I do not want to leave a message.

I'm looking for Paul Fleiger. Do you know where he is? No?
Paul! Paul Fleiger!
Hey! Ex-Excuse me.

I'll take care of this. Come on in. It's all right.
It's...Thank you.
what the hell are you doing, barging in here like a lunatic?
if you answered your phone, I wouldn't have to barge in here like a lunatic.
this is my job, Rudy. This is where I work!
this kid lives in my building.
last night, his mom left him alone, and she ain't been back since then.

I don't know. Do what lawyers do. Give me some advice here.
you want my advice? - Yes, I do.

Shh. Shit!
Rudy.
wait!
Hey, Rudy.
do you need some money or anything?
let me guess.
and in exchange for the money， I don't come around to your office anymore? Hmm?
you should be so ashamed of yourself right now.
what's going on? - That's him. That's the kid right there.
who are you? - I'm the neighbor.
what's the kid doing with you?
I was looking after him till his mommy comes back.
his mommy's not comin' back. Come here, kid.
if you need anything else, give me a call.
I will. I think I got it from here.
what the hell's going on? - His mother got picked up by Vice last night.
come on. We need to get you packed and out of here.
you got a suitcase? Where are your clothes?
come on, come on. Show me where your clothes are.

let's go, let's go, let's go!
Hey, hey! You don't got to shove him like that.
sir, step aside, please. - What is your name?
sir, I'm gonna ask you one last time to step aside.
I will not step aside until I know your name, lady.
my name is Miss Martinez, Family Services. You have an issue?
I have an issue, Miss Martinez. It's you...

# The show must go on #
# Hey, one monkey don't stop no show #
# If you don't want my love #
# You're free to go #
# You can go, you can go, you can go #
# Life s a play #
# We play different parts #
# But to be a star in love #
# you've got to feel it in your heart #
# You've been acting strange #
# You don't love me with soul #
# Well, there's lots of other guys who'd love to play your role #
# If you don't want to be my leading man #
# Get out of my life and let me live again #
# You can go, you can go #
don't you think we should have this discussion in private?
no. Anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of them.
I'm sorry.
I'm from Walla Walla, Washington.
Walla Walla, Washington. Very fun to say.
and when I graduated college, I took over the family insurance business.
I married my sweetheart, and everything was perfect, except...
let me guess. Selling insurance bored you to death...and you secretly longed to meet the drag queen of your dreams.
Oh, it's the oldest story in the book.
boy meets girl, boy loses girl...
boy kicks open the closet door and finally meets Mr. Right.
I don't know.
anyway, I got a divorce...and, uh, loaded my suitcase into the car...and I moved here to study law and change the world.
how's that world changing going?
honestly, when I got this job, I thought I'd make a difference, you know.
I-I thought I'd fight the good fight...protect the innocent and prosecute the guilty.
uh, I'm just babbling now. Tell me about you.
you don't want to know about me. - Yes, I do.
no, well- No, there's really nothing to it.
I don't believe that. - Okay!
do you really wanna know about me? - I do.
Georgie, give me the blues in "F." - What are you doing?
you just sit here and look pretty.
# Well, I was born across the country in a place they call Queens #
# But I left my home behind me way back in my teens #
# Now I live in the so-called paradise #
# Where they spray their grass green #
# Ain't got much in the way of possessions #
# I ain't got much dough #
# I work in this bar to pay my rent Keep the wolf from the door #
# There are better things in life than money #
# But I still would like some more #
# So, you want to know about me, baby #
# Well, I'm here for you #
# I've got exes and baggage and hang-ups and shit #
# And so do you #
# We could stay in this bar all night talkin' #
# Or go to your car for Round 2 #
boy, you've got an amazing voice.
Yeah, this lip-synch thing, it's just a cover.
what I really want to be is Bette Midler.
you should do it. - What?
sing. Do your own stuff. I don't know, make a demo.
making a demo takes time and money both of which are in short supply these days.
what the hell?
what? - Stop the car.
shit.
Marco. Hey.
how- How did you get all the way over here?
I walked.
you walked? Where are you going?
home.
home, like, to your mommy's place?
you're going the wrong way.
come on.
he's not a stray dog, you know? You can't just keep him.
I'm not gonna keep him.
I'm just gonna...
I don't know.
once they find out where he is, Family Services is gonna come take him.
then we'll hit the road, me and Marco, like fugitives...always one step ahead of the law.
I can already see my outfit.
houndstooth suit, black overcoat and a gray fedora.
I will look fabulous.
what?
you're remarkable.
Oh, stop with the compliments already. - I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm kidding.
don't stop.
tell me all the ways I'm remarkable.
it's like nothing scares you.
Yeah.
well, that's a front.
I'm actually terrified of wearing white after Labor Day.
good morning.
Oh, what time is it? - 8: 30.
Oh, shit!
have you got time for breakfast before you go?
no. I'm already late.
how about lunch? - No, I have plans.
dinner? - Look, I'm really, really late.
uh, just give me your number, and I'll call you later.
uh, yeah, right. That's the thing. I don't have a phone.
uh, well, call me at the office, okay?
will you take my call this time?
Ex-excuse me.
I'm hungry.
Oh.
then let's get you some food, young man.
so, um, what do you eat for breakfast?
doughnuts.
doughnuts are poison.
they make you fat and give you pimples, okay?
um, let's see. Oh.
do you like peanut butter?
carrots?
cheese.
cheese and... crackers.
there we are.
cheese and crackers. Breakfast of champions.
it's what they eat in France.
pay up or get out. - I got it. I got it.
what's he doing here? - He's just dropped by for breakfast.
there. It's all there. Do you want to count it?
do Family Services people know he's here? - No, they do not.
and I'd prefer to keep it that way. Thank you.
okay, young man.
we've gotta get a move on.
you eat your breakfast, and I will put my face on.
Hey, sport.
Hey.
I heard you had some... interesting visitors in your office yesterday.
Yeah. My cousin.
he can be a little high-strung.
cousin, huh? - Yeah, on my mother's side.
he was upset about a custody issue.
I thought you told me all your family lived in Washington.
they do.
but your cousin lives here, huh?
are you deposing me?
relax, sport. I'm just making conversation.
uh, Mr. Fleiger. Hi, Mr. Wilson.
Yes, Monica?
uh, that guy, Mr. Donatello, is on the phone.
thank you.
um, I was about to go and get some lunch...
I was wondering if maybe you wanted me to get you something...or if you wanted to come with me?
no, thank you. I'm not hungry. I'm just gonna work through lunch.
okay. Cool.
you dirty dog.
what?
you didn't tell me you were gettin' down with that.
I'm not gettin' down with that.
relax, sport. Your secret's safe with me.
we got a problem.
Why?
the manager of my building saw me with Marco this morning and I think he called the cops.
Wow.
just stay away from the building until we get this all sorted out.
me and Marco, fugitives from the law.
I don't know about that.
I've been doing some research, and I found out a couple interesting things - Like what? - Let's talk about it in person.
do you want to have dinner tonight?
my place? - I thought you'd never ask.
1254 Havenhurst, Apartment 3.
say 6: 00? - I will be there with bells on.
okay. Bye. - Bye. Bye-bye.
that man does not know it yet, but he's desperately in love with me - How's it taste? - Mmm. It's delicious.
it's my mom's world famous lasagna recipe.
you don't like your own food?
what do you like?
doughnuts. - Doughnuts. Wow.
this just might be your lucky day.
Oh, doughnuts for dinner ain't healthy, Paul.
one doughnut every once in a while never hurt anyone.
you like chocolate? Hmm?
are you just gonna look at 'em, or are you gonna eat 'em?
thank you.
you're very welcome, young man.
there.
is my mommy coming back?
no.
am I gonna stay with you?
I don't know.
will you-Will you tell me a story?
sure.
there ain't no books here.
you want me to make one up?
Mm-hmm. - Okay.
I like happy ending.
Mmm. Don't we all, sweetheart?
okay. Once upon a time, um...there lived a boy whose magic was known throughout the land.
and he lived a very happy life with his mommy and his daddy...and his grumpy little sister, Lulabell.
what's his- What's his name?
who?
the boy with magic.
well, his name was Marco, of course.
you're gonna try and keep him, aren't ya?
Yes, I am.
you know it's not gonna be easy.
well, I should just toss him aside because it's not gonna be easy?
Marco didn't ask to be born to a junkie.
he didn't ask to be... different.
he didn't... ask for none of this.
and I just don't see why he should be punished anymore...for stuff that ain't his fault, you know?
okay.
"okay"? What does "okay" mean?
it means there's only one way to legally do this.
what the hell are you doing here?
after you were arrested, they took Marco to a foster home, and, uh...Is he okay? - Yeah, he's okay.
he's okay now. He's with us. - That's good.
you understand that unless Marco has an assigned advocate while you're incarcerated...he becomes a ward of the state?
who the hell are you?
I'm his lawyer and his friend.
his "friend." Hmm.
is that what you people are calling it these days?
we have some legal papers we'd like you to sign.
and what do they say?
that Rudy shall be granted temporary emergency custody of the minor child...until such time as your incarceration terminates...and you petition for reunification.
which means what in normal-person talk?
that Rudy'll take care of Marco while you're locked up.
what's it gonna cost me?
nothing.
nothing?
you're gonna take care of my kid for nothing?
not just me, honey. Mr. Lawyer here is offering to help too.
like I said, me and Rudy are friends.
I have to talk with you about something before the hearing.
what?
there's no way the judge is gonna grant you custody...with you living in the apartment you're in.
Hey, I know it's not the Taj Mahal but, trust me, I've lived in worse places.
I know. It's just...The court is gonna require that Marco have a safe environment and his own bedroom.
what?
if it's okay with you， I'd like to tell the judge that you and Marco live with me.
are you asking me to move in with you?
no, no. J -Just to fulfill the legal requirements.
Yes, you are. You are. You're asking me to move in with you.
there's no other way you're gonna get custody, Rudy.
and I have an extra bedroom, so... - The answer is yes.
yes?
Yes.
okay. That's good.
okay. That is good. Yeah.
just don't mention our relationship.
your Honor, Marco's mother is currently incarcerated.
there are no known relatives...
she's signed emergency orders granting Mr. Donatello temporary custody.
and is there an education plan in place?
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Donatello found a local school that has a special education program.
and is there a Mrs. Donatello?
you're looking at her, sweetheart.
what did you say?
what Mr. Donatello means is that he is not currently married.
but California state family code 143. 089 clearly stipulates that marital status shall have no factor...
when temporary, emergency orders have been signed by a custodial parent，relax, sparky.
it was just a simple question not a cue for you to recite your vast knowledge of code law.
Yes, Your Honor.
I see here that Mr. Donatello lives with you. Is that correct?
Yes, ma'am.
and what is the exact nature of your relationship?
he's my cousin.
we know you love your doll, but...
we got you all those other toys, too, that you could play with...the robots and the teddy bear and the pig.
is this my home?
Yeah. This is your home.
Oh, sweetheart.
are you all right?
you okay? - I'm so excited.
that's okay.
it's okay.
it's okay. It's good to be excited, huh?
huh. Here we go. Follow the light.
now say, "Aah." - Aah.
the kid's in rough physical shape.
it's pretty clear he hasn't been treated well in years.
his eyesight's terrible. He's gonna need glasses.
and, he's susceptible to all kinds of medical conditions...including thyroid problems intestinal abnormalities and a high risk for leukemia.
and the good news is?
well, I just want to make sure that both of you understand...that raising a child with Down syndrome...is a major commitment.
we got it. We signed up for the gig, didn't we?
now, he's never gonna go to college or leave home on his own or get a job.
what you see is what you get.
that looks really great.
good job.
Hi. This must be Marco.
Hi, Marco. I'm Miss Fleming.
nice to see you. - You too.
what's your doll's name?
Ashley.
Ashley.
okay, I'll take it from here.
uh, shouldn't we wait a little bit?
Yeah. You know, to make sure he's okay and everything.
I think it's easiest if you just leave quickly.
Oh. It might be best for him, but what about me?
we'll see you at the end of the day.
let's go meet your friends, okay? And bring Ashley with you.
okay, this is the gang. This is Marco.
we're doing a big puzzle right now. Do you want to join us?
um... - Okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna get you a chair, all right?
okay, what do we got? "The cat sat by the door."
that's pretty good, except there's two O's in "door." Good.
let's try the next one.
the bug sat in the grass.
"the bug sat in the grass."Think you can do that all by yourself?
yeah? Let's see ya.
that's right.
I am so sorry. - Nice of you to join us.
Marco had loads of homework and Paul was late getting back from the office.
Yeah. You're a regular Ozzie and Harriet, ain't ya?
what's going on?
where are you taking me? - Stop it.
my eyes are closed.

I thought you should see this. Marco says it's a picture of his two daddies - "His two daddies." - Oh, no, no. That couldn't possibly be me.
I never wear canary yellow. It makes me all pale and washed out.
look, I personally don't care what your relationship is.
we don't have a relationship.
like I said, I don't care.
but people talk, and other teachers talk. Other parents talk.
all it takes is one person saying something to the wrong person...and you could have a real pickle on your hands.
nice. Top.
so I decided I'm gonna put you on the Franklin case.
Really? - It's a big step. Are you ready for it?
Absolutely. Thank you.
you know we're held to a higher standard at that D. A.'s office, right?
sure.
so I'm gonna ask you straight. Can I count on you?
you can count on me.
good. Take it out.
Oh, before I forget. We're having a shindig at the house Saturday.
can you make it? - Sure.
is your cousin and his kid still living with you?
uh, Kelly wants to invite them too.
Oh, we'd hate to impose.
Hey, trust me, it's not an imposition. Come on. Come on.
I know. It's just... - I insist, all right?
so stop flapping your gums...
and tell me you can make it.
okay, I can make it. - Ho!
you must be Rudy. - Enchante！
Oh. Such a gentleman.
what do you do for a living?
I'm a performer. - I knew it.
I could just tell that you were an artist.
I could just tell from your energy. You just have such an artistic style "Performer." That's a pretty vague answer, isn't it?
what details were you lookin' for?
this is Marco.
Oh! Can you give me five, Marco?
go ahead. Give her five, Marco.
it takes him a few minutes to warm up. - Oh, it's okay.
just make yourself at home. Enjoy the party.
honey, Phyllis is over there. We need to go.
Yeah.
Hi, Mr. Fleiger. - Hey, Monica.
you remember Mr. Donatello? - Yeah.
poor, poor Lois Lane.
she has no idea that her mild-mannered Clark Kent is faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive...and able to leap tall cocks in a single bound.
so, what's the game plan here, hmm?
we're gonna be, what...wrinkled, old queens still telling people we're cousins?
do you want to lose him? 'Cause that's what'll happen.
that's discrimination, Paul.
no, that is not discrimination. That's reality.
good thing the black people had Dr. King instead of you.
different situation, Rudy.
no, Paul, it is not.
Monica, what's wrong?
what's wrong?
Marco! Mar... Leave him!
Marco! You have no right, lady!
sign on lines 7, 12 and 13.
we gotta get him back.
there's a 72-hour mandatory evaluation period.
there's nothing we can do until then.
our son is God knows where. He should be home and safe with us.
he's not our son.
fuck you!
you had temporary custody subject to the judge's...
Oh, fuck the judge.
sure, fuck the judge, fuck me and fuck the fact that I lost my job today!
that's the best thing that ever happened to you.
best thing that ever happened to me? - Yo!
you don't have to live a lie anymore.
now is your chance to-to be you.
listen, I spent the last 10 years of my life...studying, saving and busting my ass for that job!
so pardon me if I'm not in the mood for your idealistic bullshit!
you told me you became an attorney so you could change the world!
do you remember that idealistic bullshit?
so here it is.
here is your chance to kick open that closet door and do some of that world changing.
your Honor, we are requesting that Marco be released into our custody
your request is denied.
and after lying to this court about the true nature of your relationship，you are lucky that I don't charge you both with perjury.
Oh, please. - Respectfully, we ask that you consider...
you got him in some home when he belongs with us.
get your client under control.
is this your idea of justice?
Mr. Donatello - We are talking about a human life here!
Mr. Donatello - A human life that you people don't give a damn about!
Mr. Donatello.
if I so much as hear one more word out of your mouth this morning, I will find you in contempt of court and have you tossed back into jail.
now, I have already ruled on your request and there is nothing that you can say or do...no matter how impassioned or dramatic...that will make me change my ruling.
so unless you have some other business before the court, I suggest the two of you find another venue in which to display your histrionics.
what if we file a petition for permanent custody?
I will rule against it.
state code 143. 56 prohibits you from making a determination in a permanent-custody case without a hearing.
you are wearing my patience thin, young man.
your Honor, I am simply trying to ensure that an innocent child isn't allowed to fall between the cracks of the system.
please.
that's good news, right? - Define "good."
she agreed to hear our case.
a case we can't win.
stop. Stop it!
Paul, I believe in you...and I believe in us and I believe that no matter what, we have right on our side.
okay.
I have a lot of prep work I need to get started on right away.
Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'll help you.
I'll be your secretary now that you've broken Lois Lane's heart.
no. There's something else I need you to do. - No. No.
Rudy. - Paul, do not make me wear the Ward Cleaver suit again 'cause wool and me- it's just... like oil and water.
this is about your job.
it's about your job.
Rudy.
look, I know, I know. I get it. But I talked it over with Paul.
for us to have any chance of getting custody， I can't be working as a drag queen.
so you're just gonna quit on us? - Well, come on.
please. She quit on us as soon as she decided to become a wet nurse for the little retard.
don't ever call my boy a retard. - Rudy!
okay? - Rudy, we go on in 20 minutes.
we cannot do this without you.
sure you can.
you always wanted to be the star anyway.
how long have the two of you been in a relationship?
well, I guess that depends on how you define "relationship."
we met in September, and, uh, that's when Rudy and Marco moved in.
and how long after you met did Mr. Donatello and the child move in?
how long? I don't know exactly.
well, why don't you just give it a good guess?
couple of days.
it was love at first sight, but we didn't want to rush into anything.
did you ever see Rudy and Paul without ther clothes?
did they ever touch you in your private areas?
did they ever hit you?
young man, unless you give me some answers, you won't be able to live with Rudy and Paul ever again.
do you understand that?
do you want to live with Rudy and Paul?
did you ever believe Rudy and Paul's story that they were cousins?
no, I did not.
and did you tell anyone about your suspicions that they were, in fact, homosexual lovers?
absolutely not.
why not?
sir, I believe that we are all sexual creatures...and how the parents of my students choose to enjoy their sexuality...is no more my business than their personal finances.
but we're not talking about finances here.
we're talking about a lifestyle that most people would call deviant.
objection. Argumentative.
sustained.
were you ever concerned about the effect..that Rudy and Paul's lifestyle might have on Marco?.
no.
interesting.
nothing further.
miss Flemming, would you share with the court your thoughts on Marco's progress at school?
well, if you merely look at his academic growth， it's clear that he- he flourished intellectually.
but I think the most interesting aspect has been the improvement in Marco's social skills.
so, in your estimation, the change you've seen is in part due...to Mr. Donatello and Mr. Fleiger?
Absolutely.
Mr. Donatello and Mr. Fleiger...are as compassionate and loving parents as I've ever seen.
what was your impression of Rudy and myself as parents?
well, I admit I did have my initial reservations...but overall, my impression was very positive.
and the home environment that we created for Marco?
it appears to have been safe, comfortable and loving.
you evaluated Marco, didn't you? - I did.
and did he express his desire to live with Mr. Donatello and myself?
he did, very much so.
and would it be your recommendation that it would be in Marco's best interest to be raised in our care?
it would.
can you tell us about your relationship with Mr. Donatello?
I never had a relationship with Mr. Donatello.
I mean, he's cute and all, but he's definitely not my type.
how do you know Rudy?
we used to work together, at Fabio's.
we had a female-impersonation act.
which means?
which means we put on shiny dresses wear makeup and wigs and lip-synch to songs.
it was tres sexy.
did Rudy ever bring the child to the bar?
sometimes he would bring Marco to rehearsals.
mentally handicapped child in a gay bar.
Wow. - Is that a question?
no, no. Just an observation.
let's limit it to questions, Mr. Lambert.
he would only bring Marco there when the bar was closed.
I don't believe I asked you a question. - I know.
I was just trying to clarify. - Trust me, it's clear.
now, did you ever see, uh, Rudy and Paul kiss in front of Marco?
they're lovers.
so the answer to my question is?
Yes.
okay, so they kissed in front of the child.
now, are we talking a peck on the cheek or was it something that your friend might call"tres sexy"?
when you're on the stand， just answer the questions straightforward and simple.
no Rudy-isms.
no Rudy-isms? - No Rudy-isms.
I need you to be cool, okay?
I will be cool.
as cool as the other side of the pillow.
let me see how cool your pillow is, mister.
Oh, Mr. Fleiger.
Oh, I'm very sorry to report, but the underside of your pillow is quite hot.
I'm gonna have to take your temperature. - No.
No!
Oh, yeah.
it's kind of hot down here.
I love you.
Yeah, I know.
shut up.
Oh!
Mr. Donatello.
Marco was in your care for how long?
about a year.
and he's 14 years old? - Fifteen. He's 15 now.
his birthday's May 23. - Oh, that's right. Fifteen.
so, Marco，for one year of his 15 years...was in your care?
you formed a pretty strong attachment in a short period of time.
Yeah. We fell in love. Don't take long.
clearly. You moved in with Mr. Fleiger, what, the day after you met?
objection. Relevance.
sustained.
in the one year of the child's 15 years...that he was under your care，what kind of parental figure would you say you were?
I would say I was a great parental figure.
both me and Paul were.
let's forget about Paul for now and focus on you.
what made you a great parent?
I, um...
I cared for Marco like he was my own our own.
we got him up every morning, made him breakfast...took him to school, played with him...tucked him in with a story every night.
we were... his parents and we were damn good at it and we would like to keep on doing it.
that's very clear, Mr. Donatello.
did you, uh...
did you call the authorities the police or Family Services after you first found out that Marco was left alone after his mother's arrest?
no. I called Paul.
he is a lawyer, and, uh, I thought he would know what to do.
Oh. And did you call the authorities...after he came back after running away from the foster home where he'd been placed?
no, I did not call the authorities.
in fact, you and Mr. Fleiger...decided unilaterally to just keep the child.
isn't that correct? - His mom signed the papers that made it legal.
his mom, who's doing 36 months for a drug-possession charge.
your Honor, a mother's incarceration doesn't deny her right...to make custodial decisions on behalf of her minor children
let's move on, Mr. Lambert.
um, your friends testified...that you took the child to a bar called Fabio's.
they're not my friends.
so, did you or did you not take the child to a gay bar?
not when it was open.
so the answer is yes?
you did take him to a bar that was frequented by homosexuals.
Yes.
and your friends also testified that you took part...in a female-impersonation act.
was their testimony accurate...that during the time Marco was in your care...you wore a woman's dress and makeup for work?
Yes.
have you ever worn a dress and makeup in front of Marco?
no.
no? You sure?
are you sure that that is the testimony you want to give under oath?
Halloween?
"Halloween"?
what does Halloween mean?
I, uh, dressed up like the Bride of Frankenstein.
Oh, so the correct answer is yes You have worn a dress and makeup in front of Marco.
your Honor, asked and answered. - Overruled.
just answer the question.
it was a costume!
uh, Marco was wearing this, um, funny Frankenstein head.
paul was a cowboy. - Mr. Donatello.
I asked you a very simple question.
have you ever worn a dress and makeup in front of Marco?
Yes, I have.
did you ever once worry what effect that would have on Marco?
no, I did not.
what is Marco's favorite toy?
I'm sorry. Did you say something?
his favorite toy was his doll.
it's a girl doll, right?
dress, long, blonde hair, makeup?
you know, you can twist the truth any way you like...but it does not alter the fact that Marco is a needy kid who deserves a family.
see, I'd argue that this is becoming less and less...about a needy kid who deserves a family and more and more about a couple of needy men...who aren't willing to truly look at what is best for the child。
Oh, and you think you know what is best for Marco?
you didn't even know how old he is! - Mr. Donatello
he didn't even know that Marco had a birthday last month, Your Honor a birthday he spent alone!
your Honor, may we get a recess? - No, Mr. Fleiger!
have you ever engaged in sexual activity in front of Marco?
Objection! Relevance! - Overruled.
what, you think we're child molesters now? - You said it, not me， any fucking we did was in the privacy of our own bedroom!
Mr. Donatello.
look, just because we are different does not make us bad parents!
this is such bullshit! - You are out of order!
how can you make a ruling...when all we've talked about is gay or straight or dolls or fucking dresses?
why aren't we talking about the real issue?
this hearing is about Marco...who at this very moment is sitting in some foster home and who will sit in some foster home forever because no one wants to adopt him.
no one wants to adopt some short, fat, mentally handicapped kid.
no one in this entire world wants him， except us.
we want him. We love him.
we'll take care of him and educate him...keep him safe and raise him to be a good man.
isn't that what he deserves?
isn't that what every child deserves?
I'll take your comments into consideration, Mr. Fleiger.
Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Your Honor.
ain't going to be much longer, and we're gonna have you out of there.
so you pack your bags...cause we are bringing you home.
promise?
Yeah.
Yeah, I promse.
after listening to all of the testimony and reviewing all of the paperwork， I'm prepared to make my ruing.
it's very clear that Mr. Donatello and Mr. Fleiger have had a powerful and positive effect on Marco's life.
they have made numerous sacrifices and they have ensured that all of Marco's needs were properly met.
however, I cannot ignore the other facts of the case.
while Mr. Donatello and Mr. Fleger obviously love the child. It is this court's opinion that they have at times. Subjected him to inappropriate situations.
and that their openly homosexual lifestyle, Could be assumed by the child to be normal.
and could lead to confusion, sexual...
Hello? - Is this Rudy Donatello?
who's this? - Miles Dubrow.
I own a club called "The Spot in Hollywood."
I gotta tell you, I'm quite impressed with this demo.
you got a hell of a voice, kid. - Thanks.
tell you what I'll do.
I can offer you two nights a week to start. We can see how it goes.
I know it's not much, but... - I'll take it.
# You abandoned me #
# Love don't live here anymore #
# Just a vacancy #
# Love don't live here anymore #
# When you lived inside of me #
# There was nothing I could conceive #
# You wouldn't do for me #
# Trouble seemed so far away #
# Oh, you changed that right away #
you're a lawyer. Why don't you handle the appeal?
we believe the judges and Marco's court-appointed attorney are biased against us.
Oh, so I'm your man 'cause ain't nobody in that courtroom got a bias...against a black man who knows the law better than they do, huh?
let me guess.
all them white lawyers you talked to before you came to me didn't want nothing to do with this case, did they?
that's 'cause they know you're gonna be judged by the dicks you've sucked and not by the content of your character.
we can find another attorney. - Rudy, wait.
the word on you is you're a smart lawyer and a hell of a negotiator who's not afraid of a tough case.
well, your case is beyond tough, my friend.
we're well aware of our chances.
frankly, it's damn near impossible to get custody as a gay man.
frankly, it's damn near impossible to do anything as a gay man.
I have found several examples of case law...that I believe clearly support our argument.
okay, gentlemen, let's talk some straight shit.
if I decide to take this case...everything you have ever said or done is gonna be fair game when we walk back into that courtroom and we tell them...that the great and powerful Judge Meyerson has made a mistake.
and you think they were biased against you before?
they gonna get some nasty dog who's gonna dig and dig and dig...until he finds every person you have ever fucked...every drug you have ever snorted every street you have ever crossed without waiting for the walk signal
do you know the one thing I cannot stand when I walk into a courtroom?
surprises.
so I'm gonna ask you guys some tough questions, and I need the truth.
Hello? - Hello. Uh, this is Rudy Donatello.
I was looking after Marco for a while.
Yeah, I know who you are.
I was wondering if I could, you know, maybe talk to him...just find out how he's doing and let him know I'm thinking about him.
Marco ain't here no more.
your Honor.
they have moved the child from a foster home to a state institution.
we're requesting visitation from our clients.
as the child's court-appointed attorney, I don't see any change in circumstance.
can't recommend a modification. - Agreed. Request denied.
if you simply weigh the interests of the child.
I said request denied.
fine. We'll be filing a motion to have this case heard in another court.
I will cite the deep and loving bond that clearly exists between the minor and my clients...their willingness to adhere to all conditions as stipulated by the courts
and, of course, your complete and utter unwillingness...to consider the best needs of the child.
this really the way you want to start, Lonnie?
I don't know. It seems like, to me, the ball's in your court...
Richard.
do you have supporting documentation?
I had my girl type these up for you in the off chance that, you know, you saw things my way.
I'll approve one visit prior to the hearing supervised, 30 minutes- not a second more.
you look skinny.
you getting enough to eat?
do they have doughnuts here?
well, no doughnuts. No wonder you're down in the dumps.
will you tell me a story?
you want the one about the magic boy named Marco?
with the happy ending, right?
okay.
once upon a time...in a land far, far away...there lived a magic boy named Marco.
gentlemen, I was looking over state law last night and found that California allows adoption...by folks with a history of substance abuse and domestic violence.
not us. - But not you.
which I intend to argue quite passionately is a violation...of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.
of course. That's brilliant.
what's the 14th Amendment?
the state can enforce no law which abridges the privileges or immunities of a citizen. Nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction equal protection of the laws
which means what?
which means they're supposed to treat you the same as every motherfucker in this state.
what the hell is he doing here? - Who?
D. A. Wilson.
probably just observing.
all rise for the honorable Judge Richard Resnick.
okay. Let's get right down to business this morning, shall we?
Mr. Lambert.
I'm prepared to approve your motion to dismiss...pending the testimony of the mother.
wait a minute. What motion to dismiss?
have you coordinated with the D. A.'s office?
we have, Your Honor.
what the hell's going on? - I don't know.
your Honor.
you're dismissing my clients' case without any notice or explanation?
when did she get out?
your Honor, I'd like to request a recess.
request denied.
excited about going home?
miss Deleon, I received your petition for reinstatement of custody
wait. She wants him back now?
are you prepared to reassume the responsibilities as the child's mother?
I need an answer a yes or a no.
Yeah.
that's not my home.
that's not my home.
miss Deleon has also filed a restraining order on behalf of her son against Mr. Fleiger and Mr. Donatello.
what? Restraining order? - The restraining order is granted.
your Honor - You gave him up!
you signed them papers! - Miss Deleon has served her sentence.
do you know what you're doing to that kid?
she's served her sentence!
she's a junkie, Your Honor!
she now has the legal right to petition for resumed custody of her child.
you're gonna let her have her kid back after how she done him wrong?
miss Deleon, you're free to go. - On what grounds?
your Honor - This hearing is over.
you can't do this!
you really need to consider what's best for the child in this case!
this is a travesty of justice, travesty! - What did they promise you?
what did they promise you, Marianna?
do you know what you're doing to that kid? This ain't right!
Oh, my God!
that's not...not my home.
it's not my home.
D. A.'s office brokered the deal with her and Lambert.
they got her paroled early...as long as she was willing to fill out the petition for custody.
so what do we do now?
nothing you can do. Mother wants the kid, mother gets the kid.
ain't a court in the world that'll give that kid to you.
so go home, get on with your lives.
it's gonna hurt like hell at first, but time's a great healer.
if you're lucky, maybe the kid'll come see you once he's grown up and away from the mother's control.
there is no justice, is there?
you went to law school, Mr. Fleiger.
I'm surprised that's not the first thing they taught you.
that don't mean we stop fighting for what's right.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
wait, man. We can't do this in front of him, man.
go out in the hallway till I tell you come back in.
did you hear what I said, you fucking retard?
get out! Go!
go!
Marco, babe.
will you go out in the hall for a few minutes until Mommy's- until Mommy calls you back, babe, okay?

you might have seen it when it was published, although I doubt it.
it was buried deep in the middle of the paper...not nearly as important as the front-page stores about rising gas prices or presidential politics.

who died all alone under a bridge.
after trying to find his way home for almost three days.
since you never got to meet him in person.
and since this article is short on details.
I wanted you to know who Marco really was.
he was a sweet kid and smart and funny.

he loved junk food.
chocolate doughnuts were his drug of choice.
he was the world's greatest disco dancer.
and he liked to have a story told to him every night.

we have a check here from Tim McGraw for $5, 000.
tim McGraw!
...new passion...
she is a 76-year-old woman. I do not control her.
get your hand off my neck.
...and a new determination to win.
I want to win, so get your
get your head wrapped around this task.
this is not a joke. He can get fired.
it's killing me.
I would take the bullet in a second. I-It's killing me.
and all but one of them will...be...fired.
you're fired. Go.
"the Celebrity Apprentice" starts now.
good morning. - Good morning.
welcome to the USS Intrepid.
tremendous amounts of money, last season on "Celebrity Apprentice,"
were raised for the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund
a great charity.
we're very happy about it.
now, we are going to be doing battle.
and let me tell you, this ship was in many, many battles, won every one of them, and that's what it's all about -- winning.
and in this case, you win for charity.
Dennis, you won five NBA titles. How do you feel about this?
I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.
huh? I'm good, baby.
you're okay? It's all love, baby.
so, I'm looking around, and I'm like, "Wow, I'm with a really fascinating group of people.
first of all, who can miss Dennis? He is enormous.
and, you know, he's a subtle dresser.
and then I was like, "Oh, my God, that's Herschel Walker."
Herschel is the greatest running back in the history of college football and one of the NFL's greatest running backs.
how do you feel about this?
it's game time. Time to get it on.
you better believe it's game time.
Claudia, you invested in real estate, you did well.
how do you feel?
I'm ready to win this thing.
I'm really a fan of Mr. Trump.
he's done it so big, and if I was halfway there, a quarter of the way there, I'd be happy with that kind of success.
Andrew, do you still like women?
love them. - You love them?
I always loved them.
well, it's a hell of a routine.
I'm just an honest guy.
Joan? - I can't wait to get started.
Melissa, You've fought with your mother, and you love your mother.
what's it going to be?
we're a very competitive family, and, you know, I've survived this many years.
what's going on here?
Joan's doing the show. Melissa's doing the show.
did they ever cut the umbilical cord?
you know, Melissa's, like, 56-years-old already.
you know what I mean? Let it go.
well, you know, right now, you're broken up, men versus women.
and each one of you has a favorite charity.
if you're the Project Manager and if you win, you get a lot of money for that charity, so it's really about that.
so, you go back to Trump Tower, you pick your team leader, and you pick the name of your team, and I'm gonna see you a little bit later.
now go.
looks nice.
fancy.
Oh, this is nice. Yeah.
all right. Ooh, cute. - Okay.
does anyone want to be Project Manager?
I'll be the first. - Do you want to be the first?
I'm the oldest. I'll be the first.
okay, great, done.
Thanks, Joan.
I'm Project Manager, I think, because of age.
I'm the only one in there without a tampon in my pocketbook, so they just deferred to me.
so, is everybody thinking about team names?
it doesn't matter what our name is.
let's get the name.
let's not waste time on the name.
and let's get going on the game.
can I make a case for one?
you know how the women completely crashed and burned up in flames last year in the beginning?
so I figure that we should rise from the ashes with the name Phoenix.
Phoenix? That's one. - The Winners.
Ballbusters. The Ballbusters.
we really wanted to get right into it.
we didn't want to waste time on the name, and that's wonderful because they truly are absolutely going to work together, and I really believe that.
and there will be no backstabbing.
how about Athena?
Athena's the goddess of war.
I want to be the war goddess. I like that. Team Athena.
Yeah, 'cause she's not just the goddess of wisdom, but she's the more disciplined side of war.
and you know that we're gonna be more disciplined than those boys.
Oh, yeah.
you believe this? No bagels, no nothing.
I mean, he's a great guy and everything.
wait till I see him. - Are you gonna be complaining the whole time?
no, I'm not gonna complain. I just want coffee. - Just half the time.
I just got to stay awake.
there's coffee right there, guys.
I never want to underestimate anyone.
I think that's foolish.
but Andrew Dice Clay, he's not here to work.
he's not focused at all.
so, name first, then team leader?
does everybody have ideas?
triumph. - Triumph.
I'm gonna get a pad out and write this stuff down.
I'll be the secretary.
I'd call it VIP Enterprise.
h-how about that?
that sounds like an escort service.
we got to create a name that's got some kind of power to it.
like The Money Getters?
the Money Getters. The Money Getters.
the Money Grabbers.
I think we should be Team FUBAR.
Oh, man! FUBAR!
this is the most potentially dysfunctional group.
you know, the way I look at it is we're putting the "fun" in "dysfunctional.
so getting down to come up with the team name?
impossible.
all kidding aside, everybody here, a champion in their own field.
in everybody's field, you are the kings of the universe, strong.
nobody's gonna pick that. - Just take the letters.
Yeah. - Wait, we may be doing it wrong right now 'cause we got too much going on right now.
what -- What we may need to do first is elect a Project Manager who then take control of this situation.
think you got one.
who? Herschel?
Yeah, it seems like.
is -- Is everybody all right with that
to go with Herschel as the Project Manager? Yeah.
I don't know why Herschel Walker became Project Manager.
I didn't have no vote in that one.
I think Scott Hamilton and Clint Black went like this.
I don't think he has any leadership skills, as far as being the voice of command.
he reminded me of a 15-year-old kid.
all right, so you're gonna be the P. M. on our first task, and you're also charged with picking the name for the team.
I'm not just a football player.
I'm a businessman.
I created a food business and got a lot of employees.
we do very, very well.
I'm smarter than I look, and that's what people don't realize.
I think "KOTU" is gonna be a word that's gonna mean "strength.
so I'm gonna go with KOTU. KOTU is "gods.
Yeah. - I like KOTU.
I think it's a little bit of a goofy name.
it does grow on you after a while, though, especially if you just say "KOTU.
we're KOTU.
it's sort of like almost like a "Lord of the Rings" character, like Gollum.
I would have preferred Gollum.
anybody else? - I am getting the feeling we're gonna disagree about a lot of things.
we got to just remember that we're all on one team here.
and if we win, nobody gets fired.
welcome to the boardroom.
it won't be easy, but you're gonna have some interesting experiences.
first of all, I want to ask Dennis, who have you chosen as your Project Manager?
Where's he at? Oh, here he is, right there.
Yeah, Herschel Walker.
Herschel, why did you want to be the Project Manager?
well, this is a team, and I believe in team.
I believe in leadership.
did you want it, or did they want you? Oh, no, I want it.
you know, you got to want the ball.
and if you don't want the ball, don't play.
okay. Who have the women chosen as your leader?
Yeah.
now, you know there's a big risk.
if you lose, a lot of times, the Project Manager gets fired.
Yeah. You understand that, Herschel?
I do. That's life. Okay.
Joan, over the years, you've made many cupcakes.
is that right?
well, you're gonna get a chance to do it again.
we lose.
I'm a good cook.
it'll be very interesting.
you are going to create, bake, and sell cupcakes.
the Institute of Culinary Education, they're going to loan you their ovens, their kitchens, everything.
you're going to do it there.
you're going to design a mobile sales center.
and in this, you're going to go all over the streets of New York.
you're going to sell cupcakes.
the team that sells the most in terms of money, whether it's through your celebrity or the cupcakes themselves, that's gonna be the team that wins.
now, what are your team names?
KUTO." What?
pronounce it right now.
KOTU. So, what does that
where did that come from? What does it mean?
it means "Kings of the Universe."
kings of the Universe.
and how do you pronounce it, Tom?
Oh, that's funny. - KOTU.
do you like this name, Dennis? I'm so about it.
did everybody like it or not? He -- He hated it. He hated it.
Jesse, what did you think?
it sucks. You don't like it?
Yeah. Do you know what Jesse wanted to name it?
no, no, no, no, no, the thing is, the Project Manager make the decision.
you're holding my hand. You know how I am.
we said -- Oh, I wouldn't want to hold your hand.
get the hand back.
we -- I made a decision -- That's what we're gonna go with, because we -- you have to have leadership. That's all right.
Joan, just out of cur-- What did you think of that name?
who cares? We're worried about ourselves. Okay, good.
we're not gonna give one ounce -- Good answer. I like the answer.
Joan, what is your team name?
the team name is Athena.
we picked it because we are all beautiful women.
you are beautiful. I agree.
she's goddess of beauty, she's goddess of wisdom, and she's also goddess of war done intelligently.
that's a little more -- I don't know.
there's something -- I like that name.
that's a beautiful name.
Brande, what do you think about your team?
I think our team's great.
I think that we have a very, very strong team, and I think that we are going to kick some male booty.
do you see any disharmony?
I see disharmony on the men's team, and I've gotten really good at this stuff.
I may be wrong. You know what it is?
I got to tell you what it is.
I mean, a lot of us were up all night, like Rodman, myself.
we come in there.
there's no bagels. There's -- You know, there's no butter.
there's no -- You know, so if you could just
I know this has nothing to do with the winning.
but yet we got to have energy.
and we come in there, and there's nothing to eat.
and whose fault is that?
it's your fault because they're your people.
don is going to be going with the women, and he'll be watching and observing.
and he's been a great, great guy and a very, very successful student, and now he's doing a tremendous job in the business.
and likewise, Ivanka will be going with the men, and she really understands men very well...
...I have found out.
as you all know, one team will win and one person, sadly, from the losing team will be fired, and you do not want to be the first celebrity fired.
it's never a lot of fun.
so you're gonna go out, and you're gonna make great cupcakes.
good luck. Thank you.
thank you.
coming up...
you want to go near Pennsylvania Station area. Hold on a second.
we're not gonna get the money there. Can I just -- Wait. Hold on a second.
while there's a lot of traffic there -- No, it's busy, busy.
and later...
I don't know exactly what got wrong, but those cupcakes taste like ass.
they sunk.
you guys, the chocolate cupcakes are screwed up.
let's do location first.
who knows New York? Who knows New York better?
being the first Project Manager, that's a lot of pressure 'cause you want to start out on the right foot.
we got to beat the women.
but at the same time, you got to look at the other guys, because there's no doubt they're sizing me up, as well.
you know, I'm thinking we need to be in a location where the most amount of your fans are, because you can stand out there like a carnival barker and basically attract attention.
dice is the king of New York City.
I'm the biggest stand-up comic in history.
nobody ever, to this day, has sold more tickets in concert than myself.
so, where's the fan base for Dice?
we set up somewhere in Times Square where there's a big sidewalk so there's room for a lot of people.
the thing about Times Square that worries me is it's the most obvious choice.
if we run into, you know, Team Lady Goddess over at Times Square, then we're in direct competition.
think about it this way, Clint.
they don't have who we have.
they have some people over there that are recognizable, but they don't have who we have.
who don't know Clint Black? Who don't know Herschel?
who don't know your ass? That's what I'm saying.
we cannot be worried about them.
we're gonna get all the women, and they want cupcakes.
they're gonna want it from you.
they're gonna want it from you.
they gonna want it from me.
I think, like, 10: 00, we should be near the park.
let me just tell you,
I did "Man on the Street" for three years with Court TV.
you want the Macy's, Pennsylvania Station area.
hold on a second.
they did Penn Station last year for the hot-dog thing, and it was really bad, 'cause it was just
not Penn Station, outside on the street. But Central Station.
no. No, no, they did outside Penn Station last year.
I'm talking -- I'm telling you, you go in the Macy's area
34th Street and 7th Avenue. And Macy's is right across from it.
that's busy, busy, busy, busy.
times Square isn't crowded?
I think it's very important, as Project Manager, everybody is involved.
they should all have a say.
but I think you then have to go with the one that knows the most.
I'm a New Yorker, so I knew where we should go.
Annie decided that was wrong, so that began the friction right there and then. Okay, wait.
we're not gonna get the money there. Can I just -- Wait.
hold on a second. Can I say something?
you're not gonna find nobody just walking around with moneybags around New York.
hold on -- Last year, where they sold hot dogs, they went to exactly the area that you're talking about and got heavily criticized by Mr. Trump, because his argument was that, while there's a lot of traffic there, it's not people who have a lot of coin.
Annie Duke kept bumping her gums and just talking, talking, talking, talking.
I didn't know if I was coming or going, to be honest with you.
you know, it's like, "Shut the hell up."
I'm just saying that, on the Penn Station thing, I think that we're gonna get criticized by Donald Trump
who said Penn Station?
well, Macy's is right across from Penn Station.
no, it -- Trust me, it
it's right close to there, right?
no. I'm gonna say that objection.
now, you guys can overrule me.
I just want to state that for the record.
I don't sugarcoat anything.
I say what I feel.
when I think something's a bad idea, I say it.
I consider trying to make everybody feel good, a complete waste of time.
now, is that close to 57th and 5th?
Yes, but not.
cause I have the whole Playboy building that they're all willing to go down there.
I knew that this was gonna be all about money, and whoever can raise the most money was gonna win.
and I was definitely gonna call Hef, because I knew that these guys are gonna have a lot of heavy hitters.
if she's got the Playboy building, we should go 57th and 5th.
okay. Right.
hello. How much do you think that we need to raise to win?
$20, 000. $20, 000, $30, 000?
Oh, I can do that myself.
if I bring in $15, 000, can I rely on you guys to bring in $5, 000 or $10, 000?
Annie was very assertive and bossy.
I don't think she realizes how much she is offending some other people.
we're all adults, and I don't like when people kind of talk down to you.
Hey, Tony, how are you?
I'm wonderful. How are you? I'm good.
so, here's what we're doing.
tomorrow we're selling cupcakes for charity, and I would really love it if you guys could come buy some superduper-expensive cupcakes.
going into the task, I have two objectives.
one is I want to bring in more money than anyone on my team, 'cause I think it's important to come out strong and make sure that people see me working all the time and nobody thinks that I don't have a really good work ethic.
how do we make you look the best?
that's what we
you just come down with the money.
you'll make me look great, babe.
I'll handle the vehicle decoration and all that stuff.
he's good -- He's good at that.
Yeah, Jesse knows how to hook up cars.
Jesse, you got to hook up the car.
we knew Jesse was gonna be able to handle the truck.
this is what he does -- "Monster Garage." He does trucks.
we'll go directly to the culinary school, and I'll shoot a bitching picture of all of us.
Yeah. And then we'll get that to the graphic place so we can start laying it out on a schematic. That's a good idea.
we make the vehicle and the presentation as bright and as attention-grabbing as possible.
Jesse James, when I first met him, I didn't think he was gonna bring anything to the table.
all of a sudden, he's talking about how he's gonna really amp up the truck.
it's fun to see somebody come to life.
let's go over there and get to work now and get the photo done.
you guys can start baking.
him and I will go handle the truck.
and then soon as the truck's handled, we can come over and kind of be the second shift to help.
Yeah, let's go. Let's go, man.
we're all together and moving in the same direction.
coming up...
you don't want to stay here and make some cupcakes? No.
and later...
everybody, stop decorating.
I need everybody lining cupcake tins.
we need to get these back on the racks.
Mussolini made the trains run on time.
that's what that kitchen turned into.
that was an Italian train station in there.
Kotu H-hello? It's Tom.
could I speak to Donny, please?
Hey, what's up? What's up?
I was encouraging everybody to go call sponsors and raise money, 'cause I know that Joan Rivers is just gonna be able to bring in money.
she knows everybody forever.
one big donation for her, and we lose.
well, you know what, tomorrow we're having a charity cupcake sale.
if you could send a representative of your show down, like a P. A. or something, with a cashier's check, that would be perfect.
I called up Donny Deutsch.
he's in New York. He's got a television show.
I know he's got like a billion dollars or something like that.
why wouldn't he want to send some money down?
Hey, thanks so much.
I will say -- I'll say hi for sure.
Cheers.
Donny Deutsch? He's in.
the Institute of Culinary Education Hey, there.
hello. How are you?
Hi. I'm Scott.
Jill Sanpakis. Nice to meet you.
we don't want to do a ton of different cupcakes.
Yeah, I think the fewer you do, the better, the more successful you're gonna be.
our strategy is, we're not gonna go out and try to do all these different cupcakes.
because it just had to be quick. We only had a few hours.
I'm happy to do a yellow and a chocolate if you guys want to go two different kinds.
okay, that's fine. Everybody gets an apron.
everybody gets a hat.
I'm not a baker. It's not the kind of guy I am.
you know what I mean? So I didn't want to put the hat on.
I didn't want to look stupid. I'm -- I'm from Brooklyn.
I can't have my friends in Brooklyn looking at me with the stupid hat.
you know what I mean? I can't do it.
I just can't do it.
it's like a rule -- "Don't look like a jerk-off."
all right, let's start. Chitchat time's over.
Absolutely.
you want to get a picture. Where you want to get a picture at?
I'm gonna do everybody individual like this so we can put -- in Photoshop, put a cupcake in your hand.
nice.
I do a lot of product shots for my business, so I took pictures of everybody.
the truck will be totally wrapped in a big sticker, so they'll be able to take my pictures and put them on different places on the truck.
you guys got to squeeze in. Move in for the tight shot.
what's your name?
kings of the Universe.
Athena So, we want to just do really simple chocolate and vanilla, just knock out -- Chocolate...
chocolate cupcakes. ...cupcakes.
chocolate cupcake, vanilla cupcake.
we split up into two teams.
four of the girls went to go decorate the truck, and then me, Annie, Natalie, and T.
we all came to the Institute of Culinary Education to make all the cupcakes.
and then what would you suggest for frosting?
we have a ganache -- a chocolate ganache.
Yeah, let's do the ganache.
we decided to make the two flavors that are simple, easy to make, don't put too much time in it, as long as they're good, and make as many as you can.
realistically, how many cupcakes do you think we can make?
our goal is 1, 000. Well, we'll say 750 just in case.
our goal is 1, 000.
definitely possible.
we were thinking, just the more cupcakes, the better.
even if we could sell a cupcake for $5, that's gonna add up, and we really don't know what numbers we're fighting here.
we don't know what the boys are bringing in.
this is one of the best scales in the world.
okay. Very accurate.
everything we do tonight has got to be accurate.
you guys don't have a lot of time for mistakes, right?
so let's double-check. No, no time for mistakes.
so double-check all your measurements when you get them.
you guys want to jump in? Yeah. Yep.
we're in a massive kitchen, making 400 cupcakes in one batch.
that's, like, major amounts of ingredients.
this is a little insane.
I've never baked that many cupcakes in my life.
there's no reason why anyone should ever do that.
all right, here's the truck.
there's your cupcake up top. Okay.
we got some work to do.
we broke into two groups.
myself, Joan, Claudia, and Melissa all went to go decorate the truck, the flyers, and kind of do the whole design part of the task.
we need to take measurements.
this is 8.
so, you guys will produce the decals for us? Yep.
will your people place them on for us?
we'll do the install tomorrow morning.
can we have bubbles coming out of -- just coming out?
if you can buy a bubble machine, I'm sure you can.
I wanted to make it into a circus atmosphere -- to an event atmosphere.
and as Project Manager, I believe in overkill.
the eight of us should all have, like, cute little aprons on that we all match in some way.
okay, let's go. Let's do it.
our team!
Kotu This is Jordan.
jordan, nice to meet you.
you got Photoshop and all that stuff? Yep.
okay, 'cause we -- I shot a bunch of pictures.
Brian and myself -- we went to the graphics place.
I kind of think, with something like this, we could go superslick and designed bitching, but I think cheesy is kind of the way to go.
priority here is, like, put things on it in order of importance.
by far, Dennis Rodman's the biggest name.
my design's gonna look like "Celebrity Cupcake-star Galactica."
what do you want the background to be?
I mean, if we do a flat black and then our logo and everything else on it.
no pictures? No, the background color, which isn't very cupcakey.
interesting.
my role in the designing was to do whatever Jesse needed me to do.
I'm just sort of playing my role.
I'm staying out of the mix 'cause if you stay out of the mix, the bull's-eye can't be on you.
you do what you're told, and there's really no way to sort of be in harm's way, I think.
glad you know about this
Athena Joan, what I had him start on is the flyer, okay?
cause with this, you can incorporate this into your whatever you want on the truck. It looks great.
mark will take your directions, and he'll be your hands.
are you Jewish?
no. No?
so I have to explain to you. Jews like a lot of crap.
I would like to go "Celebrity Cupcakes," stars all over the place.
come meet and eat with.
Mm-hmm. Cute.
take out where he mentions the price.
just say, "All proceeds to go to charity, today only."
Joan's doing really, really good as Project Manager.
however, it kind of seems like Melissa's Project Manager, because she's kind of calling the shots, and her mom's kind of letting her call the shots.
and let's do it and then let's go.
well, we got to sign off on this so we can do the rest of it.
okay. Center that, please.
and that's gone.
all proceeds to go to charity.
Kotu All right, so, now he's gonna start cracking eggs for the vanilla cake, so let's -- we're gonna do 105 eggs.
105? Yes.
10 1/2 pounds of butter.
we need 11 ounces of vanilla.
sorry, got some on you.
we had to bake for hundreds of people, so you got flour, eggs, sugar.
4 pounds, 5 ounces. Keep going.
6 pounds, 2 ounces. Keep going.
and exact measurements.
okay, it could be 15 pounds, or it could be 15 pounds, 2 ounces.
it was a very labor-intensive task, and, uh, we could have used a little more help.
okay, bye-bye. I'll go over in a few minutes.
all right, goodbye.
listen. I got to go to Sirius Radio.
yes?
I'm gonna do two different shows that are gonna draw all kinds of people, but I just wanted to clear it with you first.
when are you doing that? Now.
Oh, really? Yeah, for tomorrow morning.
you don't want to stay here and make some cupcakes?
no.
we're all a team here, making the cupcakes.
maybe you should stay and make some cupcakes with the team.
I want to win.
right, right, right. Okay.
in the kitchen, everybody was working, except Dice didn't do crap, but that's Dice.
so you know how he work. That's his thing.
clay want to go do Sirius Radio.
it's okay with me.
he's not -- He's not doing nothing anyway.
andrew Dice Clay is a hilarious comedian, but he doesn't quite understand what's going on when Clint Black and Herschel all look at each other and go, "Yeah, you should go."
why don't you not make cupcakes?
and I know they're trying to throw Dice under the bus.
that's what they're doing.
you can't really trust anyone here.
Herschel, I'm going over to Sirius Radio now.
Dennis is going with me.
okay. All right.
all right, so, I'll see you a little later.
do good.
all right, thank you, thank you.
my job right now is to make sure that we get as many people as possible to be there tomorrow morning.
come on, let's get out of here.
and I can do that through my connections at Sirius and go on certain shows that are gonna attract maybe too many people.
I want to do my part in this.
I feel I can do better at going on the air and getting people there.
so the least I can do is get a ton of people to come buy cupcakes, and we'll win the challenge.
Yeah.
but damn, you really didn't even put any
no effort. No effort.
all right, you want me to admit it?
I don't want to make cupcakes.
I hate making cupcakes.
that's all I wanted you to say.
Athena
how is that cupcake row?
they came out beautiful, and it's our last tray of vanilla. Yay!
guys, I'm very impressed.
these finished cupcakes look fabulous.
I like the chocolate icing on top.
I was the lead baker on anything that had to do with vanilla, and everybody seemed to really like the vanilla with the chocolate frosting and the chocolate chips on top.
these look really good.
they are pretty damn pretty, if I do say so myself.
okay, should I check the chocolate cupcakes?
you guys, the chocolate cupcakes are screwed up.
they sunk.
they look like a nightmare.
these ones. Those don't look good.
the chocolate cupcakes didn't rise like the other ones.
I was in charge of mixing the chocolate cupcakes.
I don't have a clue why they didn't rise.
why did they sink?
I'm not saying that Natalie caused the problem, but she actually mixed it all together.
so if it is a problem with the way that it was mixed, that would definitely fall on Natalie.
Khloe, stop washing. Come help me scoop, please.
I was frustrated, but I literally was just so on task that I was like, "Okay, another batch of vanilla so that we're covered in terms of the number of cupcakes."
Hello?
Hey, how are you, Brande?
Hey, what's going on? Can you come here and help us?
Uh-oh. Hold on. She's got news for us.
hold on, guys. Yeah, yeah.
okay, go ahead.
the girls are saying, "We need help. We need help."
we only have an hour to get all these cupcakes done, and we've only done half the cupcakes.
and I'm like, "Okay, we're coming now."
okay, all right. All right, we're on our way.
let's go. Let's go.
if we have no cupcakes -- No cupcakes, no money.
Kotu Excellent.
Hey, man.
Hey, welcome to madness!
how's it look?
it's good. I think we're good.
when I came back from the graphics place, the team seemed separated in two tribes.
it's like Paris and Nicole, which is Dennis and Dice and the rest of us.
you know, we're willing to work, and those guys have already left.
want a little bit of the top?
no, I don't want any.
how is it?
I tasted the cupcakes, and they tasted really, really bad and awful.
Oh, my God, they're horrible.
they're terrible. They're what?
they're not good. What happened?
something got mixed up here. Not good.
we forgot to put the sugar in.
as a Project Manager, Herschel was, you know, overseeing all of our production and issues, and, uh, he just dropped the ball.
do they all taste like that? Yes.
I'm not sure we're gonna have time to do a whole nother big batch.
we could syrup them, 'cause they're in cups. Right.
so if we brush them with syrup, they'll absorb the syrup.
all right, let's go.
once we realized they were that bad, we made a syrup and brushed that onto the top of the cupcakes, hoping that it would sweeten them up enough.
I don't know exactly what got wrong, but those cupcakes taste like ass.
we're rescuing a not-sweet-enough muffin.
you will like these cupcakes.
like, kind of like perfume on a what?
perfume on a turd, right?
exactly.
Oh, my gosh, you can see the sugar going right in.
Jesse, look, the sugar just -- it soaks right in.
we didn't put enough sugar in.
we put the sugar in after.
it's a new thing. It's a whole thing.
look at it soaking in -- the sugar going in.
it's like a sponge for sugar.
it's still got that, like...
taste. More sugar, more sugar...
more sugar. And icing.
I'm ready for more syrup.
ATHNEA Hi, girls.
okay, tell me what you want me to do.
these are so disgusting Oh, my God Who said they're a good baker?
who was that? Who was that?
I-I didn't make those ones, sweetie. Okay.
I made the vanilla.
some of these are actually okay.
tastes fine. Nice and fudgy.
what do you think, we just fill it with frosting?
I think so.
once they cool, they're gonna firm up a little bit, and we'll do a ganache on top.
that was where Chad was really great, 'cause he kind of stopped us from panicking, 'cause he was like, "Look, let them cool, we'll put ganache in them, and we'll see how they taste.
and everybody who was big chocolate lovers thought they tasted great.
so we used as many of those chocolate cupcakes as we could.
crud.
it's hot.
do you want to take a tray and start doing this, too, Claudia?
Yeah. And then I'm gonna show you how to do this.
Oh, yeah, I know how to do it.
okay, so, you hold it here, scoop it up this way, and then spread it with the back of it.
Yeah, that seems pretty self-explanatory.
and then I'm gonna go through and dip it in the chocolate.
I admire strength in women, but Annie Duke talked way too much, telling people what to do.
and she does have valid points and she does have some good ideas, but she does not ever shut up.
okay, listen, guys, we have 10 minutes to bake.
I need everybody lining cupcake tins and helping me fill 'cause otherwise, literally, we will not get these in the oven in time.
okay, I need somebody to load more muffin tins, please.
I will load the muffin tins.
everybody, stop decorating.
we need to get these back on the racks.
fun stuff, huh, Joan?
and you -- you thought you were Project Manager.
you get so much more with everyone being nice.
please, let's make sure we set aside a box for people who are coming down for big donations.
I think Annie did a great job in there, I'm sure, organizing.
she's a great organizer.
Mussolini made the trains run on time, but no Italian smiled when he was getting on and off.
and I think that's what that kitchen turned into.
that was an Italian train station in there.
okay, guys, we've got 20 minutes.
we've got to get these covered.
we've got to get these out of the oven.
coming up... Whoo!
ladies and gentlemen, we have the Naked Cowboy here!
and later...
you don't even know what other people are selling cupcakes for, and you're mad at me if I wanted to sell one whole flat for $9, 000.
you're not even listening to yourself.
Athena Yeah, okay, these go here.
so go ahead and do that one. - That's for that?
I know that goes there.
this one goes on the back rear.
this morning, our team split up into two groups
six to go finish up the cupcakes, and Brande and I to go pick up the truck, decorate it, get everything done.
or the bigger one?
Yeah.
it was down here with "Cupcake Cares," right, on the bottom of each of these guys, right?
uh, but there are two different sizes.
can I have this one here?
yeah? Perfect.
it's 8: 05.
we have an hour and 55 minutes before we need to be done and on our way over to the culinary school to pick up the cupcakes.
let's get it on.
you're done. We're done? Thank you.
thank you so much. It looks amazing.
Oh, my God.
the guys' truck was parked right next to ours.
and when I saw what they had done, I did have to swallow hard for a minute, 'cause I thought they might be a lot more on it than we give them credit for.
I wish I had a piece of gum to go stick right on that right now.
Kotu Ladies and gentlemen, do you like celebrities?
come buy a cupcake for charity.
bring money! Come and get a cupcake!
bring your money! Come on over!
form a line.
please get in line. Help out a charity.
I think we made a lot of good decisions.
we're here in Times Square.
there's certainly no shortage of people, lots of tourists.
what kind would you like?
one that's worth $20.
all right, I'll pick out the best one.
$20 was gonna be our price point, and I think that's the breaking point -- $20.
they come flying out of ATM machines.
people have $20 bills.
$20 is the perfect price point. Oh, my God.
Athena All right, come on, let's go.
celebrity cupcakes for charity!
cupcakes for charity! Come on, people!
just donations, even a dollar.
if you want to pay more than $5, we're happy to take it for charity.
come on, people! Cupcakes for charity!
any donations, people?
this task wasn't really about how many cupcakes you sold but how much money you made.
so if you could sell a cupcake for 5 grand, do it.
if you could sell one for $5, do it.
I think the money will add up.
thank you so much, honey.
come get your celebrity cupcakes. Come on in.
I wish I could say I don't care how the guys are doing, but I totally do.
those guys have friends with deep, deep pockets.
and when a sports star calls you and says, "Yo, buddy, write me a check," you're not gonna give a little.
you want to impress him.
Kotu Tony, thanks for coming.
all right. Andrew Dice Clay, Tony Hawk.
how you doing? All right.
my friend Tony Hawk came down.
he's a huge celebrity.
everybody loves Tony Hawk, so we got a good crowd with him.
what's your limit on your credit card? Is it massive?
you got a good limit? Okay, what is the limit?
it's high. Like what?
today it's $1, 000.
$1, 000? $1, 000.
thank you very much, Tony. Thank you very much.
have a great day, my man. Okay, buddy.
Tony, you're the best.
get over here. - These cupcakes better be good.
$1, 000 cupcake from Tony Hawk. Thank you so much.
we've got so many goofy personalities to draw from
a lot of people are coming down, saying, "Clint, I love your music."
can I have a picture with you now?
okay, sure. Yeah, did you buy a cupcake? Of course you did.
a lot of people were coming to see Herschel.
I'm a huge Georgia fan.
I watched his games as a kid, and I'm thrilled to be here today.
do you like delicious cupcakes?
Tom Green, He draws a crowd everywhere.
because people want to go, "What's wrong with him?"
cupcakes?
Hey, Clint!
the Naked Cowboy wants to say hello to you.
Hello, nice to meet you.
I'm the Clothed Cowboy. How are you?
you think you can get up on the roof there?
we are bringing in a lot of money.
we are.
and you know a lot of it hasn't come in yet.
I know.
Athena Hey, I think you're with us.
I am with you guys. Come on down.
are you bringing the credit card from Hef?
Yes, I am.
57th and 5th is right in front of the Playboy studios.
I actually had a friend come down and get in the Bunny costume.
Hef IS SORRY HE COULDN'T BE HERE...
but FIVE-THOUSAND FOR YOUR CHARITY.
thank you!
Yeah, yeah! Whoo!
so we had the whole Playboy building come down
that's a hundred employees
and just sold tons of cupcakes to them.
Oh, are you a Playboy person, too?
Yes, and I wore my Bunny necklace today. Thank you.
Brande -- She had other Playboy Bunnies come by, and we got big bucks out of Hef.
she's a very smart woman lost in a gorgeous face and body.
playboy's such a nice, happy family.
so, how's it going so far? Good. Good, good, good.
do you have a second? Yeah, I do.
so, what's going on, so far, with the teams? I'm really pleased.
you know, it's hard to get a bunch of women to all work together...
Yes, it is. ...and not kill each other.
see, you can say that. If I say that, I get in trouble. Right.
Hi, does anybody want to buy cupcakes for charity?
pull over and park!
get back to work.
okay. See you in a little bit.
who wants to buy a cupcake...
made personally by Miss Playmate of the Year, touched by hands that Hef has touched?
I was just gonna say that's a negative.
coming up...
come on, dudes. We need you, man.
Dennis -- Dennis is on hiatus.
and later...
you sit here and tell me, a grown-ass woman, exactly how to frost a cupcake.
I'm certainly not gonna be apologetic for taking control of the situation.
I'm a little bit from the old school.
some people need a spanking.
Kotu - Thank you so much. - Cupcake for charity?
we've got sprinkles, chocolate, vanilla!
sign that.
can you sign my t-shirt ? right after you get a cupcake.
anybody want to get out and hawk?
Oh, this is New York, man. It's a tough crowd.
come on, guys.
there's some guys that want to meet you guys right here.
Dennis was sitting in the driver's seat of the truck through most of the selling, and he's an attraction.
you know, people wanted to see him.
but he did bury himself in the truck, and he does that well -- he relaxes well.
come on, dudes. We need you, man.
Dennis -- Dennis is on hiatus.
I didn't really understand why Dennis Rodman didn't want to get out of the truck.
but Herschel didn't take control of the situation.
so, you know, I had to do it myself.
come on, for a second, for a second, for a second.
come on a second, for a second. Come on.
let me pick you up.
I can pick you up. I can pick you up.
all right.
I know how to play games like this.
my job was to make sure that I don't interfere with selling the cupcakes, 'cause if I stood there on the corner, they got what they want.
they got a picture with me.
why would they come buy a cupcake?
see that pink truck?
take your girl down there and go introduce her to Dennis Rodman, okay?
so, basically, all I did was lay low in the van.
go get the cupcake.
now you see Dennis Rodman -- boom.
that's my job right there
make sure they buy the cupcakes first.
Hi, guys. How's it been going out here?
well, it's going pretty good.
we had two of our guys holding court, so if we can get them to come down here... I see that.
they're hustling out there, right?
Yeah, they're hustling.
we have a couple of them hustling, so they're
we got people moving.
I think the men are doing quite well.
I think Herschel has quite a bit of spirit, which is good.
but Dennis seemed a little lackadaisical, to say the least.
he was sort of hanging out in the van.
his presence probably is best served by being out in the public and attracting a crowd.
I'll let you get back to it, Herschel. Thank you, my dear.
good luck. Have fun. Thanks a lot. Thank you.
Athena Celebrity cupcakes for sale!
it's all for a good cause!
where are your cupcakes?
down there where that cupcake truck is.
here you are. Thank you.
very generous.
we're getting a lot of $10s, a lot of $20s.
and, granted, those are big bills for one cupcake.
but my concern is that we haven't gotten our big, big checks yet.
thank you. Thank you, sir.
bam. That's good enough.
Eric Benét! Oh, my God!
Hey, what's up? What's up? What's up?
I'm really good friends with the R&B singer Eric Benét, so I pretty much forced him to come down and buy a cupcake.
so, how about we buy one each for $250?
you want chocolate?
$250?! Whoo!
he came down and swiped his credit card, so I was pretty happy about that.
how are you? How are you, my darling?! Mwah!
thank you for coming. You're welcome.
I called Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb from the "Today" show.
they came down and tried to help us attract some more attention, and I really think it worked.
thank you.
Annie, these look better than what I thought they were gonna look like.
did you guys work on these? We totally made them ourselves.
all right, well, I want to buy, you know, a couple of cupcakes.
I'm here especially for you.
can I spend $2, 000 on a cupcake?
actually, two? Two cupcakes?
okay, $2, 000 for two cupcakes is cool.
poker players are one of the most generous groups of individuals that you will ever meet.
I knew I was gonna call on some of those people.
wait -- oh, you're gonna do $1, 000, you're gonna do $1, 000, you're gonna do $1, 000.
he paid $5, 000 for this cupcake.
I gave her $5, 000.
I've got to give tremendous credit to Annie.
Annie brought in poker players
Hey, hello, Annie.
uh, here's 9 thou. Stay healthy.
I thought it was wonderful.
$10, 000 cashier's check.
Oh! Aah! For you, all right.
cause you're the best. Thank you!
you're the best. Thank you.
get me Joan Rivers and Herschel Walker now, please.
Hello?
Herschel? Hello, there.
how you doing? How you doing?
Hello? Joan?
Hi, sweetheart, how are you? I'm fine.
now, listen, I'm sending a car for you now.
I need a member of your team to take your best cupcake to Crumbs Bakeshop on 8th Street.
all right, we can do that.
the owner of Crumbs will taste each of your cupcakes.
Yeah, yeah.
and whichever cupcake is best...
yeah?
...that team will receive an additional $15, 000 towards their total sales of the task.
okay. You understand?
you got it, honey.
pick the right cupcake.
let's see what happens, okay?
all right, we will do that.
okay, good luck to you. Okay. Goodbye, honey.
so long.
all right, Donald Trump wants us to bring a cupcake to somebody.
which one is the best cupcake?
I'll find it. Let me just look.
the monetary reward from the taste test could change who wins the game.
so I'm staring at these cupcakes, and I'm like, "Oh, God, it's like 'Sophie's Choice.'
Oh, look at that. That's beautiful.
that looks great.
I took one of the bombs
the ones that really didn't work but tasted really good, but they came out inverted, and we filled them with a chocolate ganache.
I found a perfect bomb. Great.
Kotu All right. Thanks.
Donald is gonna send a car for one member of our team to take our best-tasting cupcake against their best-tasting cupcake.
dice, you want to go?
okay. All right.
make sure you give me your best one.
now, you decide which one you want to do.
well, the yellow cake is, like, the real cupcake.
okay, we'll do that, then. We'll send that.
all right.
Hi. Hi. Hi, welcome.
I'm Melissa.
nice to meet you. Welcome to Crumbs Bakeshop.
thank you. How you doing? I'm Andrew.
I'm Mia. Nice to meet you.
Jason. Nice to meet you. Welcome to Crumbs.
we're the owners of Crumbs. Welcome.
a box isn't gonna help.
well, ours is also about presentation.
well, I can't wait to try them. But I'm gonna let you go first.
okay, I will go first. I want you to go first.
we had a really hard time choosing, but we went ahead with what we're calling the Chocolate Bomb, which is a chocolate cupcake with homemade ganache.
fine. And what do you have for us?
well, what we wanted to go with was, like, an old-school-type of cupcake that everybody would like
chocolate fudge on top with the yellow cake and just some sprinkles to keep it company.
we have some like those, too.
well, here we go.
all right.
nice. I'm gonna let Mr. Trump know which one I like better.
thank you, guys, for coming in, and good luck.
take care. Thank you. Bye.
Bye-bye. All right, so long.
later. See you later.
when she took the bite of my cupcake, her eyelids went up and her eyebrows went up.
she didn't do that with Melissa's cupcake.
we win.
that's just the way it is.
Athena So, tell us.
did we give them the chocolate-chip one that the people liked the most? No, I didn't know that.
the chef liked the vanilla with the chocolate chips on top the best.
Yes. Okay.
well, I went with the ganache.
Oh. No, they tasted great.
okay. I tasted them, and I thought that one was really good.
no, I know. It's just that those were ruined cupcakes.
the chefs were very clear that they liked the vanilla with the chocolate chip, which we discussed in the kitchen.
but she wasn't there when they discussed it. I wasn't there.
I was not in the room when the chef said, "Oh, the vanilla are the best ones."
no one told me.
and I thought the ganache -- the Chocolate Bomb.
if we don't win with that, it's gonna be used against me, and I'm not looking forward to that.
I just had to make a call. - Okay.
Athena 25 MINUTES REMAINING I don't know.
no, no, not $5. Come on, you can do more than $5.
it's for charity.
we don't have that many left, and, like, if we run out, we can't even sell any more, and then we're gonna lose to the boys.
I just had this horrible thought
what if we run out of cupcakes and the person comes with a $5, 000 check and we can't exchange a cupcake?
that would be a real shame, to lose 'cause we didn't ration the cupcakes out really well.
Joan, These are my two big spenders
my really, really big spenders.
how many cupcakes would you like?
we are thingking of buying the whole truck.
you can't buy the whole truck.
okay, we'll buy as much as we can.
so you're gonna buy a lot.
we'll buy a lot. We'll buy a lot.
we need to give them as few cupcakes as possible, 'cause we don't have that many. Okay.
they are very strict around here...
okay.
about giving out cupcakes
Oh. It's okay.
how much is he paying for these?
for these? -- for this big tray of cupcakes?
Oh, I -- I don't know yet.
can you find out, because, seriously, we're gonna run
I'll deal with it. I'll deal with my money, you deal with yours, okay?
I know what I'm doing.
Annie was out of control.
I could not believe how rude and mean and condescending she was to my big donors.
all right, can I talk to you, Joan?
she just told me, "You worry about your donors, I'll worry about mine."
and he won't even -- She said that he hasn't even told her how much
so -- shh, shh.
let me -- Let me -- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
let me talk to her. Now, easy, easy, calm.
they're freaking out that -- So ridiculous.
okay, thank you, guys.
we'll take three or four. He's giving $9, 000.
okay. Can you -- Okay? I mean, come on.
Annie started to freak out at her.
they were giving us $9, 000.
if the guy wants 24 freaking cupcakes, he can take 24 freaking cupcakes.
$9, 000 gets you this box of cupcakes.
there you go. Good luck to the girls.
thank you. Thank you.
okay. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
how nice of you, seriously.
thank you, guys.
that's it!
15 Minutes remaining We sold them all. How about that?
I got pissed off because we had literally just discussed that we didn't have that many left.
it's so great that he donated that much money, but, still, we couldn't give away a whole tray.
so we ran out of cupcakes 15 minutes early.
this was $9, 000, and everybody else is selling them out there for $1 and $2.
Yes. And when you think of a whole flat
no, because the other thing is I said to you, "For how much," and you go, "I don't know."
it doesn't matter. It was my sale.
it doesn't matter. Yes, it does.
you yelled out at them -- yelled at them, saying they can't buy a freaking whole thing.
you don't even know what other people are selling cupcakes for, and you're mad at me if I wanted to sell one whole flat for $9, 000.
you're not even listening to yourself.
doesn't even make sense to me.
Kotu
Kotu 10 minutes remaining Hey, Doug Wilson's in the house!
you made it down! Great to see you!
you call, I come.
the day started kind of slow, but now we got it going.
I tell you, we got it going on.
a $1, 000 cupcake!
Wow. $5, 000, ladies and gentlemen.
check for $5, 250.
I'm here to buy cupcakes, from what I gather.
okay, how many cupcakes would you like to buy?
$7, 200 worth. Oh, that works.
our big hitters -- We've asked some to come in.
we got a couple more coming.
people are on the street, buying, and I think that's what's gonna get us the win.
they want two cupcakes, $1, 000.
$1, 000. Well, thank you, my dear.
$4, 000 cupcake, ladies and gentlemen.
$4, 000 cupcake.
thank you.
Hey, Herschel, how much time we got left?
we got about 7 minutes. 7 minutes left.
Herschel, do we lower the price?
two cupcakes for $20.
you know, I've been calling Donny Deutsch, but I don't have 100% confirmation.
they're coming to me right now?
I'm hoping he's gonna come in with something.
I'm hoping that it worked.
I don't want to go to the boardroom today.
I don't want to see anyone on our team get fired.
4 minutes remaining Oh, my gosh, this is incredible.
is he not gonna make it? Oh, what -- after all this?
let's drop the price to 5 bucks right now!
this is -- I'm starting to think it's not gonna happen.
2 minutes left! 2 minutes!
1: 57 remainging Cupcake! cupcake! We're selling out!
remaining Hey, Tom. Hey, here we go!
Hey, my gosh!
ladies and gentlemen, from Donny Deutsch
"big Idea with Donny Deutsch" on CNBC
a check for $10, 000...
...for one cupcake!
I've learned a long time ago, if you stay together as a team, you can win.
that's it! We're done!
Hey, let's have a hand for the New Yorkers who spent so much money today!
I don't like losing, so to lose would be devastating to me.
I don't like to lose.
I've heard there's been a lot of money raised by both teams.
what did you think of your team, Joan?
I think they're extraordinary.
everybody worked absolutely, at every job, 100%.
who was the star of the team?
um, Brande.
Oh, really? Wow.
wow, thank you. Very great honor.
what did you do that made you the star in Joan's eyes?
I really went after it and just made a lot of phone calls and just did everything possible to make it a success.
and she brought in a lot of money, Joan?
she brought in a lot of money, and she was there. You needed somebody to do something, she was just always there and glad to do it.
okay.
Claudia, who is the weakest member of the women's team?
Personality-wise, as far as being ineffective, I'd say Annie -- there was some issues with Annie.
and this is hard to do. No, it's okay.
Joan is our leader -- our Project Manager
and at times, I felt like Annie took over Joan's role.
Annie, what do you have to say?
well, as far as overstepping Joan's bounds, she wasn't in the kitchen 'cause she was doing the other project.
it's just this is what we have to do.
I'm aware of what we have to do.
Joan knew that I was the one who was aware of what we had to do.
you know, I'm not gonna sit there and pussyfoot around when we have a schedule and we're trying to get these cupcakes out.
so I didn't overstep her bounds, because I had my Project Manager's permission to do that.
but you have to respect your team.
and when you sit here and tell me, a grown -- grown-ass woman, exactly how to frost a cupcake
I got this. I've frost
trust me, I've frosted cupcakes before.
you know what? completely understand that.
but the chef showed me exactly how to frost the cupcake that would be the most efficient in terms of time.
Yeah, but, you know, you have to also understand a little bit about environment.
here's a woman that takes money away from men killers at poker tables her whole life.
I know many men that have lost to you big-league.
do you think you're very tough, Annie? I am very tough.
and I'm certainly not gonna be apologetic for taking control of the situation so we could get the cupcakes done.
okay. Herschel. Yes?
so, tell me, what do you think of your team?
I think they were great. I'll tell you.
who was the weak link?
the weak link? Oh, gee.
you know, I don't think we had one.
you know what -- I got to say something at this point.
go ahead. So he must be the weak link.
no, no, I -- Go ahead, Andrew.
you know, I don't believe in baking.
I never did, and...
not your thing?
I had to almost invent a job for myself, and so I became almost, like
like -- like their court jester... The joker, yeah, right.
...to keep everybody moving.
but as far as the actual work and the cupcake making
he's not really a worker. That's what it is.
he's not a worker. He's a court jester.
well, that's sort of a knock, isn't it?
I mean, a court jester, to me, is a
no, no, I said it first. You really need that.
I'm a comic, and for me, it's natural to make people laugh.
you know what I mean?
I'm good like that, so I'm entertaining.
could you imagine being under a guy that turns into John Travolta for you?
I can't believe how good this feels.
or Sylvester Stallone.
Hey, can you pull your legs back a little more?
you know what I mean, huh? Can you do that?
you can't even do that, and you're Donny Trump.
Dennis, look at you.
you are a piece of work, Dennis, I'll tell you.
but I've been a fan of Dennis for a long time.
I mean, you're all, like, great celebrities.
Scott I watched win the Olympic gold.
Scott, I -- but sort of Dennis because of the whole look and the height and the whole thing.
would you say he's the most recognizable celebrity out of the group?
hard not to say that. No, no, he was, but I
did you use him in that capacity, Herschel?
we wanted to use Dennis in that capacity.
that's what we were trying to do, but he wouldn't get out of the van and work.
I'm a little bit from the old school.
some people need a spanking.
did he need a spanking?
I should have gave him one at some time, but I didn't.
but, you know... Herschel
that would be a pretty tough combination, those two.
okay, Dennis, do you think you won?
I think we
I think we had a very, very good shot.
how about finding out? Let's find out right now.
let's do that. Let's do that. Oh, thank goodness.
I think it's time to find out.
first, let me give you the results of the taste test.
the owners of Crumbs loved the cupcakes made by the women, so you won easily the taste test. Easily?
easily -- the taste test.
now, that's $15, 000 from Crumbs. That's great.
you know, men, they say your cupcake was disgusting, honestly.
Oh, nice!
they actually said it. These are professionals.
this is what they do.
Tom, do you -- do you get that? They said it was terrible.
you know, we had a few technical issues with the cupcakes.
we did, yeah.
so, Ivanka, let's start with the men's team.
how did they do?
the men did an amazing job.
their total was $49, 449.
49000
a lot of cupcakes.
Herschel, that's very good.
I don't know if it's good enough. We're gonna find out.
okay, with the $15, 000 that the women won by winning the taste test, you only need $35, 000 to win the whole deal.
don, how did the women do?
the women sold $61, 257...
...worth of cupcakes.
and you know what that means?
with all of the money that they raised, that you raised, and that everybody raised, you won $126, 000.
Yay! Joan, what's your charity?
God's Love We Deliver, which provides meals for anyone that's homebound that asks.
it's a lot of people...
it's a lot of money.
...that will be getting food and dignity.
and you'll find out that's just the beginning.
a lot of money is gonna be raised, just like we did last season.
God, it's so good.
so, Joan, I congratulate you.
ladies, I congratulate you.
fantastic. Go back to your beautiful suite at Trump Tower.
enjoy yourselves, and if you want -- and I'm sure the answer is yes...
of course we do. Yeah, we want to watch.
...you can watch the grilling of the men. Oh, yes.
okay? Have fun. Thank you. Thank you.
Congratulations. Thank you.
Fellas...sadly, somebody's going to be fired.
Yay!
what a relief. Good champagne.
what a relief.
raised a hell of a lot of money.
do you all understand we won because of many things?
that's what it was about.
it wasn't just somebody wrote a stupid check.
no, no. - It was many things.
it was everything.
how fabulous for God's Love We Deliver, which is my charity, to hand them this big check.
it's an amazing charity.
if you feel you can't leave your house, and you need special meals, you call us, and we send you your meals every single day.
it's great.
it's just a very quiet...way of having people keep their dignity until they die.
okay, guys, let's watch the boardroom.
let's watch.
I'm gonna be sad to see one of them go. Yeah.
Herschel, what happened?
I don't know what happened, you know, 'cause we -- we worked.
I tell you, my guys -- they were working. They were on the street.
they were hustling. They were working.
Tom, what do you think?
are you okay, Tom?
well, I think Herschel
he gets very uptight. He gets very uptight. XXX Do you get uptight? He's high-strung.
respond to that, please.
I think that I suggested a lot of ideas.
specifically, I suggested to everybody that we should be all calling and getting big donors.
did you bring in big donors?
I brought in some big donors.
I called Donny Deutsch. He brought in $10, 000.
my agent donated $5, 000.
I called my friend Tony Hawk. He brought down $1, 000.
so nobody was close to you in terms of raising money?
and that accounts for almost a third.
well, who else could have raised more money?
I think I raised the most, I hate to tell you.
Herschel brought in a lot of money, but Herschel could have encouraged the other players to raise money.
Herschel definitely -- Jesse, are you asleep?
no.
did you bring in any big donors?
no, none.
you didn't, Jesse?
my friends don't have no money.
why did you lose?
I think it boils down to hard work and what you're willing to commit to get stuff done.
you felt you worked hard?
I could have definitely done a better job keeping Dennis out on the street.
was he the biggest celebrity in terms of recognition?
just by sheer visibility
you know, he's the tallest.
you know, for somebody -- Size helps.
size doesn't matter, always.
well, Scott's proven that.
who said size doesn't matter?
the small one. Oh.
Brian, what would you have done differently for your team?
I mean, there's control issues, they say, but can you really control a Dennis?
I mean, how does that work?
I think we learned a lot about the fact that none of us have ever been subordinate.
so having to take -- No question.
having to take orders from someone else and have the
it's a tough job being the team leader. It's tough being the leader.
tough, Herschel, right? It's okay.
if you don't want the ball, don't play.
well, this isn't like a football team, where you're the best player and you sort of -- a tough deal.
you still have to have somebody that are gonna be willing to go in there and say, "I want the ball."
okay, let me ask you this. Jesse.
taste mattered, quality mattered, and you didn't have taste or quality in terms of what you were baking.
do you think that was a big factor?
I think our cupcakes sucked...
...without a doubt.
and we -- And we knew it last night.
they called your cupcakes disgusting.
Scott, let me ask you the question. Mm-hmm?
who was responsible for that, would you say?
I would say, you know, anyone that was in that kitchen -- everyone that was baking
because we all worked equally, we all did equal tasks.
but would you say somebody?
I mean, somebody had to be responsible.
Andrew, who was responsible for the cupcakes?
it wasn't me, 'cause, like I told you up front, I really didn't cook the cupcakes.
I actually had somebody tell me that it was
one of the things that started going on in there
one of the ideas I did have in there was let's stick to a traditional cupcake.
now, Andrew, you cut off Ivanka, but that's okay.
I-I didn't mean to do that.
his whole life has been about cutting off women.
so I've been told, actually. Go ahead, Andrew.
you got to stop with that.
we're never gonna change you. Go ahead, tell me.
this is unbelievable. Tell me.
you're unbelievable with this stuff.
um, one of the ideas I had as far as cupcakes -- forget women...
which are more important? ...was that
which are more important? Women.
by far. By far.
except for tonight.
well, tonight I'm gonna fight to keep my job...
okay. ...because one of the ideas -- I am good with ideas.
I'm somebody that's branded myself.
something you did talk about, which sort of bothers me a little, is
not to take away from Dennis' celebrity, but, you know, I am the only guy sitting here to sell out Madison Square Garden three times.
I'm the only comic to sell out every arena in this country, you know, over and over again.
and because I wasn't baking, I wanted to be used to the best of my ability, which is get on the air and promote today's, you know, charity event.
well, who said that I couldn't get on the radio and have people down?
because you couldn't. You're not funny like me.
and you are. You're very funny.
but you know what's so funny?
I will promise you, dimes to doughnut, I had more people from Georgia there than he had on the radio.
I don't think. That's an impossibility.
okay.
Jesse, who is the worst member of your team in terms of winning?
I think Dennis.
Why?
sitting in the truck and waiting for someone to show up with a check is cool, but I think if Dennis was out there being a little bit more assertive, we probably could have made up the difference.
what do you think, Dennis?
I played my card to a "T.
I walked down to the corner, even though I didn't want to do it, because I knew I was gonna take the whole situation to me, and I didn't want that.
all I wanted the people to do -- That's not true.
he -- he could have did -- he did a great job, like, screaming, hollering, "Dennis Rodman, Dennis Rodman!"
and guess what -- I brought people over there.
like I said, you want people to buy
so that's pretty effective. Can I say something?
Herschel, he was pretty effective.
no, he was effective when he wanted to, and that's the problem.
that wasn't -- You can't play half of the game.
but -- And I'm not -- But in a business.
Donald, seriously, man, this is -- This is really ridiculous.
you know what -- I love how people want to sit there and say certain things.
when you're gonna be a boss and you're gonna be a manager of any project or any group, you're gonna have to know how to delegate people.
I agree with it totally. Listen to what I'm saying.
we did not sit down and diagram what we need to do as individuals in this whole thing.
so, do you blame Herschel for that? Yeah, I blame myself.
do you blame Herschel? I'm just saying, if I was the manager, you know what I would have did?
I would listen to all your points -- all your points.
and I would say, "You know what, guys, this is what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna use Tom Green in this situation, okay?
he's gonna do this job right here. Okay, great.
guess what, in the kitchen -- please, anyone, interject.
in the kitchen, no one had any position or nothing.
there was no delegation in the whole situation.
that's 100% right.
Andrew, what would you say?
it was every man for himself in that kitchen, and
are you saying a lack of leadership?
there was a lack of leadership in that way.
okay, there was, okay.
I'm seeing Brian make a lot of faces over here.
Brian, you want to say something, you got to do it.
if we're in the kitchen, baking, and you're doing one thing and you're doing one thing and you're doing one thing, isn't that delegation?
no, it's not. Right.
I'm talking now. I'm talking now.
well, you talk. Talk all you want. I'm talking!
talk all you want.
the rest of us don't need to be delegated.
tell us what to do, we go and do it. Right.
it's so nice not to be there.
Oh, he loves pitting people against each other.
I hate that. They're gonna be a disaster tomorrow.
could we be friends after that?
we'd have to. Could we all be friends after that?
Clint, if you were me, who would you fire?
let me first say I think it's unfortunate this is how we're finding fault with our team.
and unfortunately, this is how we're going to learn.
it's the way it happens.
I think there was some lack of cohesion.
I didn't have a bird's-eye view of what everyone was doing.
who would you fire?
I think there was some lack of cohesion.
who would you fire?
Why?
I felt that he was the team member that required the most pushing.
and I love a joke and a laugh as much as anyone, but we needed manpower.
we were trying -- So you're saying, by using my talents and getting on the air and getting people down there to buy the cupcakes, you know, because it's not -- I don't know -- heavy lifting, you know, that -- that's not working?
Andrew, who would you fire if you were me?
well, I'm gonna say something.
no, no, no, just give me -- Who would you fire?
I got to say it a different way.
go ahead. 'Cause I got to do things my way.
see, because where Clint is right about me is I'm the type of guy that has to do things the way I do them, you know.
and if -- and if I mess up when I do those things, I take full responsibility.
I came into that baking room, and I was miserable in there.
I didn't like making the cupcakes.
so if anything, I'm willing to leave for a few reasons.
I personally think they all did a great job.
I think what I did was great, too.
but I don't want to be in a place where people think
I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do, even though I know I am.
so you're quitting?
Yeah, I -- I -- Are you -- Are you a quitter?
no, I -- I am somebody that
you know, if you quit right now... You shouldn't quit.
...for the rest of your life, you're gonna be known as a quitter.
I don't think you want that.
no, I'm somebody that loves to accomplish.
I know, but do you think you want that?
you know, over the years, there's been three people that quit, and those three people are considered, like, losers.
I think quitting is stupid.
I mean, I don't care if you want to quit.
you make my job a lot easier, to be honest with you.
it -- It's not about quitting.
it is about quitting, Andrew.
if you quit, you quit. You're a loser.
you're right. You're right. So I'm not quitting.
I'm back in the game.
you know, if I get fired, I get fired. I just
Andrew, who would you fire if you were me?
who would I fire? I'd fire Scott.
Scott? Yeah, I'd fire Scott.
what the hell did Scott do? I wouldn't even think -- Nothing.
that's why. He did anything and everything.
I'll put it to you that way.
he did a little of this, a little of that.
I don't think he brought anything to the table.
Scott, who should be fired?
I'm not the one to throw anybody under the bus.
I really don't want to do it. Go ahead.
you're forcing me to do this. I am.
I would say
and, you know...
if there was a little bit of distraction, everything else, it's hard for me to say it, because
Scott, give me an answer, Scott!
their hearts were in the right place, but I'd say probably it would be Dennis and Andrew.
Dennis and Andrew?
Brian, who would you fire?
tough choice. It's a tough choice.
I like all these guys.
I think I'd have to fire Andrew.
I don't need the guy who just wants to do it his way.
Jesse, who would you fire?
uh, probably Dennis.
okay. Why?
half of me thinks he could do a really good job and he's recognizable and he could pull money in, but the other half
he just doesn't have the solid work ethic that I think it's gonna take to do some of this stuff.
Tom, who would you fire if you were me?
I'd fire Herschel, because he's the Project Manager.
and I really like Herschel, but I think the ultimate responsibility has to lead with him.
well, Herschel, I will say this.
the Project Manager typically...
Oh, and I'll take it. I'll take it. ...of a losing team is, you know, not exactly the favorite son.
well, that's totally true.
I was the Project Manager. I take my licks.
but I'll say, you know what, we're not here to babysit nobody.
we're not here to guard nobody.
we're here to make money for dedicated things.
he made a very good case.
you know what the sad part is? Yes?
you made a lousy cupcake, and you could have won, because if you would have won the taste test, you would have won the whole thing, so it's too bad.
but that's the way it goes. Right.
Herschel, you're gonna pick two people to come back to the boardroom.
who are they gonna be?
Oh, that's a no-brainer.
I don't know. I think it's a no-brainer.
I have no idea.
well, who do you think he's gonna take?
come on.
who do you think he's gonna take?
well, I'm always ththe victim, you know.
no, don't do the persecution stuff with me, Dennis.
I'm just saying, you know what...
don't do the persecution stuff with me. I persevere.
you're doing just fine.
you're doing just fine. You're living well. Right, so...
I've seen your cars. I've seen your life.
you're doing just fine, so don't do that with me, Dennis.
all right, Herschel, who are you gonna pick to come back?
who are you gonna pick to come back into the boardroom?
I'm picking Dice and Dennis. Dice and Dennis?
okay.
everybody else, go back to your suite at Trump Tower.
enjoy yourselves.
I'm gonna call you three back.
all right? Thank you.
thank you.
women, turn off your TV.
that's all you get to see.
well, I'll tell you right now, Dennis is not going home.
Andrew's going home because he tried to quit.
well, no, he might do Herschel, because there's so much conflict with Dice.
it wasn't about quitting in there.
it's about, you know, I really do feel everybody did a great job.
it is what it is.
either way, we'll live to see another day.
so it's all love. It's all love.
where -- Where is he, already?
what's the big discussion?
Donny, bring us in already.
we're a bunch of guys making cupcakes.
but they're chicks. They should know how to cook.
you know how to cook?
a little bit.
if I get fired, you want to go out tonight later?
we'll go get a bite to -- I'm the nicest guy in the world.
you're not related to Donald, are you? No.
all right, so I could take you out.
all right. Be ready to go at about 8: 00.
Ivanka, what do you think?
I think it's a difficult decision.
I think Herschel was the leader, but he wasn't able to rally his troops.
that said, I don't think either Dennis or Dice really rose to the occasion.
what do you think, Don?
I think Dice can't be led.
I think Dennis may not be able to be led.
so it's kind of tough to fire Herschel when he raised the most money.
Amanda, bring them in.
sit down, fellas.
so, Dennis, who would you fire if you were me?
who would I fire, seriously?
Herschel or Dice?
if I -- If I don't have a game plan going into a game, who am I gonna fire?
I'd have to go with Herschel.
we should have been better prepared.
you know, I know my role. Everyone loves Dennis Rodman.
but Herschel didn't really use you properly.
no, he didn't -- The deal is he didn't know how to use me.
no one would know how to use you.
he doesn't know how to use me. You know what?
since Day One, everyone's been pointing out, "Dennis, Dennis, Dennis, Dennis -- he's the biggest star here.
Dennis, I'm the biggest star here.
well -- Well, okay. You know? Nobody even close.
I'm close. I'm close. How about that? I'm close.
go ahead.
so, anyway, what we trying to say is that, you know what, we should have been better prepared in the beginning.
but whose fault is that, Dennis? Dennis, whose fault is it?
I think it goes from the top to the bottom.
if I got a company, and I got all -- I got all these pieces in place, especially t one piece that I need the most
I need the most, to attract and draw something
which, in this case, was you probably. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
we don't know this for a fact.
we don't know that anybody he brought up bought anything.
no, but what he's saying, though, Herschel, is that you didn't utilize him properly.
don't use him right, which is true.
Mr. Trump, we are not bodyguards.
if we are selling -- you know, people are making money
if he can bring them in, if he can bring them in, bring them in -- we'll make a sale. Don't sit in the truck.
we can't make a sale when we're trying to do that.
Herschel -- How about this, Herschel?
as a Project Manager -- We said, "Get out."
wait, wait, wait -- As a Project Manager, you should have came over as a Project Manager
that's we wanted you to explain.
you should have came over as a Project Manager and say
I need you out of the truck.
could you not lead these two guys? No, I could lead them.
but why didn't they do what they were supposed to do?
I wasn't told anything through the week.
Andrew, who would you fire if you were me?
I would fire Herschel, because it's the boss's job to -- to delegate and tell everybody what he needs them to do.
may I -- May I answer that?
I had to figure out my own job.
I wanted them to participate. I kept begging.
Mr. Trump, it is funny.
when I got the call from you to send someone over for the cupcake,
I said, "You know what, I got everybody selling."
who do I have that don't -- who's not doing anything?
I brought nobody to the truck? Wait, wait.
no, I'm not gonna stand here if he's just
dice, you were in the truck, too.
I brought a lot of people there. Wait. let me finish.
I sold a lot of cupcakes, because -- You said, "Send someone over."
I'm looking at the situation.
I'm looking at the situation -- everybody at work.
you could be louder than me or let me talk.
everybody are working, because you're wrong, everyone
no, I'm not wrong. You are totally wrong.
I was on the corner with Tom Green. I'm the man here, and you're wrong.
you were not with Tom Green! I don't appreciate the pointing...
and the -- and the threatening.
you were not. You were in the truck.
you know, I don't go for that kind of stuff.
I'm just telling you something right now.
wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm not putting my fingers in your face.
I'm trying to make a point.
you know what -- you're not in my arena, so don't tell me about no pointing fingers like you're gonna jump up. No, but -- but I'm not.
you're not gonna do that. I'm not jumping up.
the truth is you didn't want to work. You wanted to do your thing.
what is your thing? I don't know.
but you had a good thing, whatever you think it is.
I did what I needed to do to try to promote.
I watched you when I used to live in Jersey, and you were funny.
and I appreciate -- But let me tell you what.
is he funny now? That's has-been.
Oh, so, I'm not doing anything anymore?
you didn't do nothing.
when was the last time you played ball, okay?
could I ask Donald something?
Donald, can I ask you something?
go ahead. From what I've said today, did I say anything that made sense to you as far as what I did this week?
you said some things that made sense.
okay. Not everything.
okay, but what did I say as far as
the one thing that didn't make sense was when you wanted to quit.
no, I didn't want to quit.
but you were going to quit. You were standing up.
sometimes you got to do that.
I wanted to show my kids what I was capable of doing.
in the context of the moment, though, it didn't feel like you were being a martyr.
no, but wait a minute.
in the context, it might not have felt that way, but I am a person that has always pushed myself.
okay, look, look.
I've known you a long time, and you've been great, and you're really a talented guy.
but in Dennis, I've seen tremendous fight tonight -- tremendous fight.
he's a very competitive guy.
Herschel -- He really fought to stay.
he did, and he did.
and you wanted to quit, and I hated that.
no, I didn't want to quit.
I was willing to take it for -- for a lot of reasons.
I think your kids should be very proud of you.
and I've known you a long time, and I've also known that you've been through a lot and you're not a quitter.
but, Andrew, you're fired.
and I can accept that. Thank you.
thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
don't feel bad about it. You know what I mean? I'll see you.
all right, brother. I'm good.
all right, I'll see you.
do good, guys.
well, it was a very interesting one.
it was a tough one, but I think I did the right thing.
I agree. Yeah.
if we were ever to quit, you wouldn't let us do that.
well, he didn't quit. He didn't quit.
he's a winner, and he's gonna be a winner.
I don't think I would have done anything differently.
you know, I came in there.
I told them how I felt about baking cupcakes.
and I just want to thank Donald for having me on the show.
did I have a good time on "Celebrity Apprentice"?
Absolutely.
run, Jimmy, run!
I'll meet you later in the forest!
run, run!
Frank Langella

construction, probably.
france

your guardian angel never sleeps you can go to sleep...
...and he'll stay awake beside you
I'm sorry I'm so late. Traffic.
l hope you don't mind, I took the liberty of ordering Bratwurst for everyone. You know what they say about sausage...
why don't we pass everything around and everyone just help themselves.
these are great numbers. -Great numbers
you are confident they'll be accepted?
Absolutely. -Good answer
great numbers -15 percent, 24 percent, 32 percent.
just great, don't you agree?
absolutely, we were just saying they are great numbers.
and we've got the right people where we need them.
no one is going to want to be a spoil-sport, all the players even the foreign policy guys, everybody benefits too much to throw a wrench into this one.
as you may have heard, there has been some trouble in that area of the country.
misunderstandings really, but Jack here
his group wants to make sure that we have everything under control.
we do, right?
Absolutely. - So, we're all friends here...
one last time because Jack hasn't been present in the past and he needs to hear this. Before we send these out
is there anything you want to tell us that is not in the report?
no.
I'm glad to hear that. The level of exposure were anything to go wrong would be unacceptable.
our position on this one is you break it you're on your own to fix it.
take me to the office.
I'm finished. You can lock up.
buenas noches.
wait, hold on.
l gottta take this. What's up? - We've got a problem
imf, World Bank-everyone somehow got the wrong numbers
do they know the source?
no, but we do.
they were sent out electronically by the guy you trust so much.
the one with the unbelievably good numbers.
Oh, and get this - attached to the email with the numbers shock was a short video clip. It shows what happened to the locaIs who were having trouble understanding us.
on this one, the really good numbers guy really fixed our wagon.
unless right now you say otherwise I'm gonna buy some art.
I'll buy some art
so why did you want to see me here?
is this about my gallery's fee?
saw your annual cover with my painting on it.
what did you think?
thought it looked good.
made it look like you guys weren't just a bunch of scum bags.
I've noticed from the society pages you've been spending a lot of time with that expensive girlfriend.
does she know your career peaked a Year after you got out of school?
maybe she'd find it romantic if You were broke. You want to find out?
which brings us to my original question.
to what do I owe the honor?
we've got another situation where we need someone like you.
someone with roots in the community.
we'll take them all.
so what does my lawyer say? - You'll have to let me handle this -OK
you don't need surround-sound on this, you know -You'll have to drive. - I'll have to drive?!
Yeah, I got a place in Red Hook where we can do it
does the guy I'm driving know what he's doing?
absolutely
Hey, soldier, get your photo taken
did you think you'd get away with it?
no, I knew l'd get a call like this one
so leave this world with a little dignity. Be in Red Hook at midnight - Tell them I need a couple of weeks. -A couple of weeks?!
Yes. Tell him I can make it more Easy for him down the road when I'm gone or more difficult, depending upon what I leave for people to find.
tell him I want to make a deal for two more weeks, then,
I'll get back to you.
Hello? -Is this Detective Turlotte?
who's this?
detective Turlotte, I would like to engage your professional services.
will you call me at my office on Monday, I'm in the yellow pages.
have a good day.
Hello? -I'll pay you five times
your advertised rate starting immediately. Two weeks.
that's all, then you're done.
two weeks? That's all? Yes.
and it's not your agency I want to hire, Detective Turlotte, it's you.
do I know you? Is that why you're using that Dick Tracey device?
right to the point, good. We have so little time
regrettably, I must keep my identity a secret.
it's nothing personal. It is a question of unacceptable risk.
what I suggest is that I be called " John Doe. "
Oh boy. -It's very simple really if you knew my situation you'd understand my calculations l want you to keep an eye on someone. Watch him.
tell me what you see.
what, he run off with your wife? -No, it's nothing like that
let's just say he's planning an event that will be disadvantageous to me.
what's this guy's profession? - He's a kind of hired gun with a lot of blood on his hands. That's all I can say right now.
no, no, I must aIso tell you to watch out, Detective Turlotte.
your life could possibly be in danger and I'm sorry about that.
I'm just an eye, that's all I am, an eye.
l know a lot of good ears, why don't you let me partnerwith a good ear?
no. I understand your limitations and I want you, Frank.
here's the contact information I can provide.
the name of the man is Jimmy Stevens. He's staying in apartment 32 at 840 West 58th Street. Do you have that?
Yes. - We'll schedule our conversations by phone in the early evenings. Will this work for you, Frank?
l am waiting for your answer, Frank.
detective Turlotte?
detective Turlotte, if there's a problem - if it's the money
a green canary... somebody lost their canary
what?
I'll do it
just write down the address and I'll tell the messenger.
okay, we'll take care of it.
Mr. Stevens, there's a taxi outside. You want me to hold him for you?
no thank you
have a good day
Frank, what do you think?
the subject appears to lead a very monotonous, simple existence
what do you mean? You think his life is boring?
did you get the photos? - Yes
what do you think?
you're absolutely right. l don't see anything very interesting
personally, I find myself drawn to some of the little detaiIs.
he lights a cigarette and then puts it out almost immediately.
maybe he's trying to quit. - Not a chance.
look at the way he does it. It's not haphazard.
he repeats it down to the smallest detail. It's like a ritual.
so what?
well it's interesting, a nervous habit like that with a guy who otherwise acts so smooth.
look at the way he tears his cigarettes apart after he takes two puffs.
that's all you've got for me, notes about how the guy smokes?
notice the expression on his face when he talks to the children l don't follow you
doesn't it seem strange to you the way he looks at them when he's talking to them?
no. So what?
well, Mr. Doe, it just seems curious to me that a guy who dresses with such sophistication should be spending so much time talking to children in the park.
what do you mean by that?
I just thought it was worth mentioning. That's all - That's all? - That's all, Mr. Doe. That's all
and like all ruthless contract-killers, your Mr. Stevens is close to his aged mother.
how do you know it's his mother? - It's an assisted-living facility l called it. She has the same last name.
do you want me to keep working for you?
Yes, but I need a lot more. Can you make contact with him?
you know, say you're someone eIse and gain his confidence.
do you think that's possible?
well, I said I was only an eye
at these prices, I think I can ask for you to expand your job description a little don't you think, Frank?
yes Sir, Mr. Doe. I'll talk to you later
excuse me. Hello?
this is my usual bench. Do you mind if I sit here?
no.
that is - What are the chances? - Odd, isn't it?
enjoying it? - I'm fascinated by it l think it'll be very helpful to me.
in what way? - Well, because I like to study birds...
Hello?
Frank, I hope you really have something of value for me this time
he invited me to dinner. And he called me old friend. ?
what did he talk about? - A lot of things.
I made him think I was a birdwatcher, so he starts talking about birdwatchers.
he says the best ones use their ears as much as their eyes.
and you should do the same thing when you try to practice the art of memory. He said he remembered being here on 911
not by what got repeated ad nauseam on the TV but by the smell of the smoke.
you seem to have listened carefully
no, no, I'm forgetting a lot. l told you, I'm an eye, not an ear - Did he talk about his work? - No
then that's everything you've got for me?
are you kidding?! Didn't you hear what I said?
the guy invited me to dinner! That's got to be the jackpot.
okay, Frank, but don't take it easy and get sloppy on me
watch out
we have... very little time. Good bye, Frank
hi sweetheart. I'm at work.
me too.
what kind of trouble? It's the propeller. Yes. It's not serious, just have Mark take a look at it.
it looks like another week. Yeah, it's screwy, with the amount of money this guy's paying me something's not Kosher but I don't know what it is yet. The client is going to call me in five minutes.
Yeah. - Anything new for me?
what would you say if I told you I'm looking at him right now through a window.
you're looking at who...?
at the Pope! Who do you think I'm looking at - You mean to say you're - That's right
I've got my camera planted in a window across from his living room - As we speak? - As we speak, Mr. Doe
is there anything interesting going on, Frank?
the subject is on his couch talking to someone on the telephone
you'd think he was looking right at me
I'm not paying you to find out he's talking on the telephone, that's hardly a newsflash! Can you tell me who it is he's talking to?
give me time. I'll find
basically, you don't have anything new?! That's it?
you know Mr. Doe, you are starting to bother me!
I am? - Yeah, that's right. Mr. Doe.
this is what you get for your dough, Mr. Doe, that is, until it leads somewhere and because you won't tell me more
I've no idea where it's leading... so you'd better get used to it or find yourself someone else, are we clear?
what strikes me is watching this guy is so dull it's interesting.
it's like I've taken acid and I'm watching bacteria grow on linoleum for days.
you're wrong, Frank. You'd better try harder
I happen to know right now, while you're looking at him,
he's arranging a murder l met a traveler from an antique land who said:
two vast and trunkless legs of stone...
here it is
that's fine. Thank you. And you can take that, too
certainly - It's good to see you. - Yes
we're going to have a little fun tonight, Frank.
you don't have anything against having a little fun, do you?
not at all, in fact- - I'm going to go have a cigarette - Will you join me? - I quit years ago
good for you. Keep me company, would you?
I'm sorry, sir, I 'm afraid I can't let you smoke that out here in front
of course...
would you believe it? They have customers who are worried about being poisoned by my cigarettes outdoors!
fear sells.
it's so damn depressing...
and the thing that's particularly hard on me is that I get paid to be an optimist, but recently I've been letting my melancholia to show...
you know you've got a very strange way of looking at me.
what do you mean you've been allowing your melancholia to show?
well first tell me what it is you were thinking when you were observing me like that.
alright, I was just wondering why someone would light a cigarette, put it out and start all over.
I don't know. -You don't know? That's rich
let's go back inside - Is it all birds that interest you? -Yes
but I tend to concentrate on a particular kind of bird for a period of time, and then on another.
what are you interested in now?
now? -Yes -Peregrine falcons. -Why?
l don't know. Maybe because they're predators.
predators are the fastest birds, the most majestic.
do you think that's true among humans, that predators are the most majestic?
no, not from what I've seen. Peregrine falcons are also survivors.
in New York City they were practically extinct by the 1950s because they digested so much DDT. The shell of their eggs became so fragile they'd break when the mother tried to keep the eggs warm.
now the Peregrine falcons are coming back.
survivors.
care to taste the wine now, sir?
you can leave it here.
l think we'll just let this breathe for a while.
so how does optimism pay?
my impression is that optimism pays quite well.
my job has consisted of predicting future energy needs for what are euphemistically known as developing countries. ?
and based on those predictions, international financial institutions then fund construction projects to meet the anticipated demand.
the greater the anticipated demand the larger the amount of construction. A wall is supposed to exist between our research and the companies that would profit from distorting our estimates.
but in practice that wall does not exist.
beautiful legs...
as a result, the countries are never able to pay back the loans and instead they become even more at the mercy of international capital.
try the wine.
what do you think? -About what?
the wine. -Oh, it's very good
they wanted me to make it all up...
but they didn't want to know that I was making it up.
they didn't want to know what they knew. And I didn't want to know what I know.
what changed? Was it your memories
what hasn't changed is fear, but I think I've found a solution to that fear. Even though it's a personal one.
and your bout of melancholia?
it disturbed their sleep... perhaps that's all it did
then why bother?
l have to make a phone call. This may take a few minutes.
l won't be too long. Just enjoy your wine until I get back.
the gentleman left a note for you, sir
sorry, I don't have time to explain. l have to leave immediately.
meet me tomorrow evening at the bench.
I'm sorry about last night. -What was that about?
it was just instinct. I felt I was in danger -In danger? - I felt someone was following me
come on!
listen Frank, I get the feeling someone is watching my every move.
what are you talking about? You're being watched?
there are one or more persons who are paying careful attention to everything I do.
you know what they want from you?
Yes, I think so. -Optimism?
it's too late for that. Listen, about last night - that was my treat.
I'll see you soon.
wait. Tell me what's happening. -l can't now.
l promise I will when I can
what do you have for me, Frank?
the subject thinks he's being watched.
he is. -Yes, I know
not by you, Frank, by others. They'll make contact with him soon
that means time has ran out, faster than I had hoped. So incredibly fast l had hoped you would have been able to spend more time with him and tell me who this person really is. But that's impossible now.
it's too risky. I'm sorry about this.
there is one last thing you can do for me to fulfill your contract.
a meeting will take place this coming Thursday at midnight in Red Hook.
the murder will take place down near T Street.
do you know Red Hook? -The Hook?
Yeah, I know the hook. Thursday?
l can find out more about this guy, Mr. Doe
no. Stand down, Frank. I'd like you to stay away now.
did he tell you anything about his work?
no. -You're lying
Mr. Doe, this guy is not a professional killer
he is, Frank, I tell you he's guilty!
Mr. Doe, the guy is guilty of a lot of things, I'm sure, but being a killer isn't one of them.
he's guilty! - What are you guilty of, Mr. Doe?
you're the one hiding your identity.
is it the same thing Jimmy's guilty of?
anyway, it doesn't matter what you think anymore
just be at the meeting. That's where your presence can really make a difference. Until then, lay off, spend some of the money
I've wired to you. Enjoy yourself.
a final payment with a bonus will be wired into your account after the meeting. Good-bye, Frank.
l won't be coming back again, Mom
they only serve Rattatouille here with noodles. They overcook it here -It's overcooked everywhere. - Everything is coming apart...
and you, you're like a cow's cud, like used chewing tobacco -Very used, yes. -Molly used you - Why do you call her Molly? -She used you
she sends you a kiss. She'll come to see you when I can't
you never came to see me. It's not you who are there -It's not me? -You are not there.
who's not there?
the big ugly duckling, he's not there. All around are little ducklings, - Yre you out, don't they? - Yes
little ducklings are so tiring. She's here, the big dipper!
she's not going to get me, is she going to get you, ugly duckling?
no
take your carotene! Around here they know.
take your carotene and your life won't waste away.
you will be infinite.
you will be infinite, Mama l hear you're in a bind, son.
l hear it all, you're going to be happy because you have your harpy.
they're going to finish you, aren't they?
yes
Really? Then you will have a beginning, middle and end.
have some noodle soup.
you always were a wet noodle, weren't you?
and what is a noodle, Mom?
a noodle? It's the mind of a man who is totally alone.
totally, and he doesn't even know it. Alone.
you're out of your mind, out of your mind!
calm yourself, calm yourself, Mama...
what's that?
my little finger just told me the big ugly duckling is no longer all alone, is that true?
it's true, Mom. I am no longer all alone
he told me to give you this letter
my love, as they watch without understanding, l struggle to reach the death at their hands that I have planned for myself.
before then I must see you.
l will contact you again through our beloved Lila. Jimmy
ice cream!
where is he?
I don't know, he came to see me at school
excuse me. Do you know this man? l have something to give him
Yes, it's Jimmy. Jimmy lives with Eileen on the fifth floor, but he's away. She's his " sophisticated lady. " See you!
Hello? -Eileen Brahm?
yes? I'm a friend of Jimmy's -Where is he? - Where can we arrange to meet?
I've got trouble, trouble, trouble.
holding this man of mine.
say it seems there's trouble every time I speak my mind...
thank you.
you must be a new friend of Jimmy's.
why new? - Because I know all his old friends
we've known each other a short time. How did you know it was me?
everybody eIse here is a regular l don't know why he's worried about you
Really? I know why I worry about him. Do you worry about him?
sure. - Because you like him?
something like that
let's be straight with each other, shall we?
you're wasting your time talking to me if you're looking for Jimmy.
l don't know where he is.
that's okay
first time I met Jimmy was at the club
he was with some associates. Jimmy was the one that looked lost.
that evening, Jimmy didn't miss a song.
he kept coming back to hear me sing.
you really are a masochist
maybe so, but that's not why I keep coming back.
there's a story about the painter Delacroix who wrote to his friend l heard the blue note. ? and when you sing I hear the blue note.
the blue note? That's nice
it's more than nice, it's sophisticated
that's how I became his sophisticated lady. ?
you know besides me there's a much younger woman in your friend's life.
the little girl
Yes, her mother works housecleaning in the building.
her daughter and I became friends and then when Lila met Jimmy it was like they were lost souls.
it's very sweet how important they are to each other.
here it is.
will you come see me again sometime, Frank?
sure
did Jimmy ever mention his work to you?
no, never. Good night, Frank l brought you a sandwich with extra mustard
and how did you know that's what I wanted?
you're easy to read. I gave her your letter. I read it before I did - You read it? - You didn't seal it - That's your excuse? - I didn't have to tell you
did you talk to your Mother? about what was in the letter?
are you kidding? It would be really bad if she knew
what exactly?
that some guys were looking for you. She'd say that's what happens to people like you.
like me?
she thinks you're nice.
it's because of you that l can afford to go to my school, but she says there's something wrong with you.
lf she found out guys were looking for you she'd say, " That guy has it coming to him. "
what do these guys want to do to you?
do they want to teach you a lesson?
yes
would you mind looking after her for a moment?
sometimes she really gets to me.
how's business?
l retire in six months. You think you can you find a place for me?
call me when you get your gold watch
you've changed, Frank.
l did that little favor you asked me to do. Where did you find this guy?
his information is classified above my rank. That tells me something.
it tells me you should drop it. You're just a little private dick.
you might get it chopped off like one of these guys here.
did the guys show up? -No. She's been missing you
it's because of her! These guys don't like to have someone see them.
what if they wanted to punch you?
well, what about it?
it's not the same if nobody knows or if there is some person who sees it
that's true l got this book for my birthday
tell me again about the fairies, Mama...
your guardian angel never sleeps
you can go to sleep...
...and he'll stay on guard beside you
you have nothing to worry about
why are fairy tales always for children?
fairy tales don't interest you grown-ups?
perhaps fairies don't want to live with us
but they do live with us. See that old woman? She's a fairy!
you know, I was wondering about her
you want to tell me a story? You promised me a story about Lulu.
is Lulu real?
yes
you said you found him again because you saw his name -Yes. I did in a news paper article. -With his picture
Yes.
well, why doesn't he recognize you?
well
we were about your age. Look at me now.
you know when you see somebody you haven't seen for a long time you don't always recognize them.
it was his family name that l recognized -Turlotte.
why doesn't he recognize your name?
because my mother changed our name. He kept his.
it's all he has left of his family.
what happened to them?
well, that's a story I don't want to tell you
tell me the story you want to tell me
it's a sad story and it's a happy story, too
tell it to me
it was along time ago, at a time when men had gone crazy
what were they doing?
with their planes, they were shooting at people
I'll meet you later in the forest!
yes
there is a farm over there Are you coming?
no mom, is that you?
some cheese and bread did she come back?
she was here earlier she said she would be here tomorrow with papa
did you go there?
Yes, we walked
you and Lulu, did you make it to Salsparello?
yes -So, it was thanks to Lulu? -Yes
did Lulu do anything else?
Yes. -Tell me
okay, see you tomorrow, Mr. Jimmy.
Mr. Salsparello!
Lila, would you tell Eileen to meet me tonight at the Oasis at closing time, okay? Thank you.
you look happy sitting there.
it's because you're here
why did we stop enjoying the city one day?
Why? -Yes, why?
because they are stronger than us?
not stronger. Almost stronger
almost?
why don't we get away to Diego's place?
they would find me. Even there they would find me. It's finished, Eileen.
I don't want to run.
so you're going to wait for them?
have you thought about me? -I never stop thinking about you.
you know that. I've arranged everything
aren't you afraid of what they'll do to you?
l was afraid for a very long time. l think the thing that frightened me the most was that I would be reduced somehow, to a thing.
but I'm not afraid anymore.
you said they were almost stronger. Why " almost " ?
do you remember what I told you when we were at Diego's?
every word.
you said that your love for me made you feel that there was something stronger than everything else.
you promised me the rest of the story about Lulu hello, children, what are you doing there?
the Germans attacked us we're going over there to salsparello, our parents are ove there i'm going to die, i'm afraid i'm scared, i'm going to go are you coming?
what's your name, little one?
Lulu.
I shouldn't tell you this, Lulu...
I'm afraid of dying thanks for still being here could you look at me like that until the end?
Yes, i won't move it's finished he's no longer here
without your friend that man would have died in no special way
that's right. In no special way
you're very lucky to have a friend like that
Yes, I am.
you know I'm not going to be here tomorrow.
where will you be?
I'm going to be with the men who are looking for me
who are they? Are they friends of yours?
they're the people I have to leave with
is Eileen going to be with you?
Yes, in the same way that you're going to be with me.
you know, Lila, I am very happy to have met you and very proud to have gotten to know you
good afternoon.
what do you want? Are you the new doctor?
l am a friend of your son. -Who has a son? I have a son?
Jimmy -I'm going to stuff that empty shell. -Really?
that shell, that empty shell, just look at his Michelle, his Shelly!
Eileen?
of course you lean, you're not standing upright, you are leaning on a cane that's like a dog cut from paper.
she never gave him vitamins, everybody knows that.
you're worried about him?
lf you were a mother you'd know. l make you his mother. I assign you l sign all the papers. Like that. Like that. All the papers signed. Like that.
no... not me
I'm not worried about anything. l don't have a worry in the world, but that guy - he's finished.
finished?
beginning, middle and father. His goose is cooked
Really?
don't pretend to be an idiot. l can't stand your " really " ? Really?
no, I just meant- -You mean nothing, zero!
it's me who speaks and I say he is no longer all alone. Ugly duckling
Yes, he is no longer alone
ugly cooked goose, but not alone
he has Eileen
not some her, some " one. " You get it?
you're out of your mind, out of your mind!
no you don't get it! Leave! Out! Out!
you won't get him. Now that he has someone on his side!
you won't get him!
are you looking for something?
this was in the newspaper a couple of months ago l know. I saw it the day it appeared
so you've been following me since you saw it?
that's right
and you're John Doe.
you've been playing with me this whole time. What's the game?
what do you want from me? What is it you want?
why are you doing this? Is it the money you wired me?
it's dirty, isn't it? You're setting me up to be the patsy, the fall guy, right?
no, that's not it. -Why then?
why did you get me involved with this?
the meeting will take place tonight in Red Hook down by the water
not a chance. You're on your own.
your mother speaks French, do you?
your're a bastard, Do you understand?
leave me in peace!
leave me in peace!
hey soldier boy

my Mom is working at a cocktail party on the third floor.
you have your doll
he doesn't need her anymore.
he has his friend, Lulu, who's going to be there tonight.
Lulu?
some people are bothering him but with Lulu he's okay
who is Lulu?
Lulu is afraid of nothing. He once watched another man die!

completely.
what are you doing, Frank?
tell Joe I had to borrow his boat
Joe ain't going to like this
go get him, champ
it's time my friend.
let's take a walk over there.
l knew you'd be here. It changes everything
stay still
this is 911. What is your emergency?
a man's been shot here in Red Hook
a man's been shot! Did you get that?!
south of T Street. Send an ambulance!
will you stop!?
where are you trying to go?!
Salsparello
right there, there, here
look through there
it's a whole family
can you see them?
it's Beautiful.
we've got a rhythm.
you saved that soldier last night.
what are you talking about? - You.
it was like I was seeing you for the first time.
it made me remember why I fell in love with you.
why do you answer every question with a question?
I'm a psychiatrist. - I'm a journalist.
then we're gonna have a problem here.
I didn't expect you until tonight.
welcome home.
sometimes confessing is really about the person who had the affair.
it's the way to get rid of their guilt.
what happened?
we were all at lunch when general baker had a seizure.
at least vitals are stable.
they think it's an aneurysm.
they're gonna run some tests, rush the results.
you realize this means Michael will be the post commander now?
I need an X. O. I can count on. I'd like to offer you the job.
lying flat on our backs picking our favorite stars we try shining back from this roof of ours but after a while you say, "it seems pretty far
I think you forgot how bright you are shine shimmer and you shine still in your eyes when we're 80 years old and you can't see a thing. good night.
you mustn't forget how much light you bring good night, sweetie.
I start training again tomorrow, 0600.
I'm tired.
now that's bad, right?
normally, we go at it once, twice sometimes.
is this about the time I leave?
Oh, and last Thursday three times in one night.
Yep, I think it's about that time.
you sit.
that "man excuse" is no longer accepted here.
now I'm putting this to all you.
for the first time, Trevor and I did not have sex last night.
what do y'all have to say about that?
I'm impressed.
I'm jealous.
I'm speechless.
I'm not here.
please leave a message.
come on. Look, I know it's only one night, but I've learned that when the sex stops, it's the beginning of the end.
well, the sex does change over time, but that doesn't mean it's over.
no, it just means it gets slower.
that happened with Jesse, my first husband.
the sex stopped, and fighting started.
I don't want that to happen with Trevor.
marriage is about intimacy, not sex.
you've had sex every night for the last two months?
does that really happen?
what about you? How many times do you and Michael have sex a week?
what? Yes, I asked that!
how many times a week? how many times?
we've been married 18 years.
well, that's not a number.
more than two, less than five.
and what about you? What's your sex count?
Oh, I'm still taking messages.
Oh, come on. My husband is gone.
have some pity.
we're back up to four.
but that's this week. I hope that can continue.
nice.
Cheers.
okay, that leaves you.
well, all I'll say is that our sex life is reliable.
we have a routine.
I've heard that "routine" is the kiss of death.
sorry.
so, when's Hannah white get in?
this afternoon.
who's Hannah white?
uh, she's an old friend of mine.
I haven't seen her since derrick's funeral. How's she doing?
she's good.
she's coming to town for the rose garden ceremony.
Ah, that's right. Derrick's one of the soldiers being honored there.
in fact, I should get going. Her flight probably just arrived.
Yeah, me, too.
see you guys.
Bye.
there you go.
thank you now I don't know how to solve your problem, but I sure as hell know how to shake up a routine.
what?
fastest way to a man's zipper
tight jeans, new haircut.
finally, you're here.
Hi!
Oh, it's been way too long.
I know, and for once, it's not a wedding or a funeral.
you look great.
so do you. So do you.
where are your bags? - Oh, I've got one.
so is there anyone new in your life?
Oh, a boyfriend? I went on one date.
he, uh, talked about his ex-wife the whole time, said she didn't appreciate him enough.
seriously, it is hard.
any time I meet somebody,
I compare 'em to Derrick. And who can live up to that?
no one can replace him, but you will meet someone.
I know I will, but somehow, I just haven't been able to move on.
I-I think attending this rose garden ceremony will help with that, though.
Yeah. -Yeah.
I can see how that would help.
I appreciate your problems, major. As acting commander, this is my decision.
leaving five days earlier than expected is difficult for everyone but your men are gonna must be ready.
so, working weekends and longer training days is the only answer.
good afternoon.
sir, I need to discuss another issue with you.
what's that?
I just spoke with my congressional liaison.
there's gonna be another friendly fire case brought before congress.
that's the last thing the army needs right now.
it involves someone we both know
lieutenant colonel Derrick White.
there's something that I've been wanting to tell you.
about a month ago, a soldier from derrick's unit came to see me.
he told me that derrick was killed accidentally by an American soldier.
this completely contradicts what the army told me.
Oh, my god.
that can't be right.
derrick was killed in Afghanistan over two years ago.
that's the official report, but one of white's men, Corporal Blaine, says that derrick was killed by one of our own.
Blaine has been more and more insistent that the army isn't telling the full story.
are you sure?
I believe him.
he has nothing to gain by fabricating the story.
he was there. He witnessed derrick's death.
he doesn't want to go to congress, but his attempts at getting the truth failed, so he's going to congress to force an investigation.
so, he's gonna testify in front of congress to force the issue?
Yes.
Hannah isn't there any other way?
no.
and Congress needs to know that Derrick's family will not stand for this.
and it gets worse.
I'm going with him.
okay. Not, not too short. Not too short.
remember? Ah, trust in the Scissorhands.
okay.
who wants another banana-coconut margarita?
not while I'm on duty.
Hey, you guys... thanks.
Claudia Joy's doing okay, huh?
you gotta admire how she's handling things, especially with Ms Lenore Baker trying to take her down like that.
Yeah, you really think she'd use what happened against Claudia Joy?
that's how it works around here sometimes.
well, what do we do?
we stick together.
we support Claudia Joy no matter what.
we deep-fry Lenore Baker and serve her up with a side of hush puppies.
you're amping up the sex factor already, Mrs Sherwood.
especially when he sees you in them jeans.
Oh, I should return those.
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying 'em.
excuse me. Aren't you the one with the problem?
my sex life is fine.
Oh, well, if your sex life is all that, then I am just gonna stop with this makeover and have myself a drink.
Yeah, and we take that whole new look over there and bring it back to the store.
thursday nights and or Sunday afternoons.
always? - Really?
it's just when frank tends to be in the mood.
well, what if you're in the mood one of the other hundred hours?
don't you just throw him down and take him?
no, I don't.
I couldn't do that.
I mean, Frank always starts things off.
it's just the way it's always been, you know? It seems to work for us.
that would not work for me.
I got needs of my own.
Ah, yes.
I know. We all do.
but, Roxy, I hope you know that sex is not the only way you can be close to someone.
let's see it.
nice.
shake it. Come on.
that's what I'm talking about.
Yeah, honey. I'm in here.
Hi, honey. - Hi.
how was your day?
Oh, this thing is acting up again.
I can't get a wireless signal.
Oh, now what the hell? Why those lights going on?
Oh, who cares?
Oh, you look... you look different.
different good? - Yeah, yeah.
hey... are we going out?
uh, no, I-I thought we could stay in.
Oh, okay, good.
Yeah, 'cause you know, I need to fix this.
so, what's gonna happen?
it's gonna be all over the news tomorrow.
the media's gonna report it as another friendly fire cover-up.
you know, most of the families that I counsel can deal with losing someone to friendly fire as long as they're told the truth.
they understand the fog-of-war aspect of combat.
it's collateral damage.
Yeah, but this case is a little bit more complicated.
Hannah was told that derrick died in Afghanistan.
Blaine is saying that they were actually in Pakistan when derrick was killed.
we're not supposed to be fighting in Pakistan.
no, we're not.
my gut tells me that that's the real reason behind the cover-up.
the army is protecting national security as well as our relationship with that country.
makes sense.
Yeah, I understand the army's position, but, um... I still feel for Hannah.
I keep getting this image of Derrick and Michael walking up to us at that New Year's Eve party at Fort Carroll.
Oh, I will never forget that.
these two handsome men in tuxedos smiling at us.
saying, "it's almost midnight. Close your eyes.
Yeah, and we get our lips ready for that big midnight kiss...
only to have those strong arms pick us up.
Oh, it was so romantic, though.
until they threw us in the fountain and screamed "happy new year!
michael swears that was Derrick's idea.
Yeah, and Derrick swears it was Michael's.
I don't know.
I can't tell you how much your friendship means to me.
thank you for being so supportive.
of course.
this has been an emotional day.
will you tell Michael that I stayed up as long as I could?
you'll see him in the morning. - Okay.
all right. Good night.
all right. Sleep well.
you, too.
that is so hot.
then giddyap, cowboy, and come get you some.
I would, baby, I would, but I feel like a brick house fell on me.
first day back, and we march 20 miles.
so, we're not gonna - if that's okay.
I just can barely keep my eyes open, you know?
we don't have another choice.
no, that's it.
look, you're asking her to leave our home.
Claudia joy, you are not understanding the magnitude of this.
Hannah is testifying before congress.
the media will turn her into a public critic of the army and the war, and if she stays with us, we will be perceived as supporting her beliefs, and that impression can ruin my career.
you're right.
we have an obligation to the army.
if you want, I will tell Hannah.
no.
I should talk to her myself.
that's it.
so, you mean even after you got "roxy-ized,
you still didn't get laid?
I think he was confused.
confused? I'd say he was a little slow.
Yeah, I agree. You're strong.
throw him down.
Yes. - No.
so, what about you, Ms Roxy?
how was your trip to the Netherlands last night?
well, my fellow traveler was too tired.
No!
Yes. He passed out.
and your evening recap, sir?
one round of sex talk with the ladies is more than enough. Thank you.
Where's Claudia Joy?
Oh, I don't know. She and Hannah were supposed to be here.
I hope they come, considering.
what do you mean?
uh, it was in the paper this morning.
I'm famous.
I mean, who would have thought?
look, I don't know how to say this other than to be honest.
it's the timing of everything.
michael is the acting commander of this post.
are you asking me to leave?
you know how much I love you, how much we both love you.
of all the people I know, I thought for sure, you would be the one who would understand.
michael can't be seen supporting a critic of the war.
the war?
I haven't said anything about the war, for or against it.
I think they're lying to me, Claudia Joy.
don't you understand that?
Yes, I do, but I have to support my husband.
and I have to support mine.
you want to know what I think?
uh, I think this means "no," Marilyn.
the only reason anyone would testify before congress is to get attention.
attention?
her husband died.
she has the right to support him in any way she wants.
not that way.
I grew up in the military, and no matter what, you do not air your dirty laundry in public.
Hannah White testifying is only gonna make us all look bad.
because she wants to find out how her husband died?
Pamela, we are at war, okay?
mistakes like that happen.
our troops need our support right now, not wives testifying at D. C.
excuse me. Don't you mean widows testifying in D. C?
I think she's right.
Pamela's right.
if my husband died, I would want an answer, too.
nothing she says to congress is gonna bring her husband back.
okay, is this you talking or frank?
because apparently what frank thinks is the only thing that matters.
ladies, this is clearly a complicated issue.
we're not gonna find a solution right now.
so why don't we just agree to disagree?
so, are you telling me, Roxy LeBlanc, that you don't have an opinion on this?
no.
I don't know what the hell is going on, and I don't care.
all I know is, I've never seen you or Denise this upset, much less at each other.
so whatever stupid army rule this is, it can't be that important.
you know what, Roxy?
you don't get off that easy. Sometimes these things matter.
and you know what? You just can't play the new girl this time.
where you at?
where are you, Joan?
I'm right behind you.
come on!
I see you found a spot you like.
I did.
what took so long?
Where's that army training?
it's my bike.
Oh, that's what it is. Always the machinery.
this was a great idea.
thank you for supporting me through all of this.
you've been there every step of the way, and I really appreciate it.
you're welcome.
this is, like, the first Saturday I've had off in years.
But?
but I almost feel guilty enjoying myself.
Oh, we can always go.
uh, not that guilty.
good, cause I got something I want to read you.
I was going through some old boxes, and I found this.
december 11, 1998, "Had another date with Joan walker today.
she wore a blue dress.
every time I see her, she gets more and more beautiful.
she told me she wanted to make a difference in the world.
everyone says that, "but for the first time, I believe it."
and that's when I realized I've never been in love as much as I am now.
I almost forgot who that girl was.
I didn't.
I love you.
I love you.
sorry I'm so late again. - It's okay.
where are the kids?
sleepover.
Hey, have you heard about that whole Hannah white thing?
Yeah, why?
Pamela got really mad at me today not understanding why it's such a big deal.
back in Alabama, I think me, and my friends had one political talk a year, and it was usually over which candidate was hotter.
well, Roxy, it's always a big deal when the army gets slammed in public.
you know, there's a lot of guys that think Blaine should be kicked out for testifying.
Oh, god.
but it sounds like the army lied.
Yeah, it does... and that sucks.
Ohm... oh, my god.
that is awful.
it's okay. It's okay.
that stump that looks like hamburger helper is not okay.
you need to see a doctor. - No.
that's the last thing I can do.
I already raised enough flags with my knee.
what I need to do is get in shape before I deploy.
if you died like Derrick did, how would you feel if I went before congress?
well, being dead, I wouldn't feel much.
but if you want the truth,
I'd be proud of you... damn proud.
but I could never say that in public.
what are you doing?
I threw Hannah out of our house because you said what she was doing was wrong.
what else could I have done?
you could have told me the truth.
I did what was right for this family, for our lives here on post.
you did what was right for you and the army.
Hey, Pamela, are T. J. And Finn still going to the roller rink with your kids tonight?
are you speaking to me?
no.
well, I recognize your voice, and that was you talking.
so, are you still not talking's Denise, either?
Roxy, I think this is a big deal.
sometimes you gotta take a stand on things.
fine.
here's my stand.
Hannah white's husband died.
it could happen to any one of us you, me, Denise even Marilyn and Angie over there, standing and pretending they don't know each other.
it's our worst nightmare.
so why are we all fighting'?
we're in this together.
anything else, sir?
we've been fielding calls all day about the rose garden memorial ceremony. sir.
with Hannah white attending, there'll be too much press, pulling focus.
we need to cancel it.
can you handle that for me, please?
I don't think that's a good idea, sir.
why is that?
with the press there, canceling the event is only gonna make the army look worse.
the event has to go on, and Hannah white has to be allowed to attend just like any other widow.
how can you say that?
she is compromising the army.
because I support her, sir.
I understand the army's need to protect national security, but people shouldn't have to go to congress to get a straight answer either, sir.
as your X. O. I support you, sir, and I will follow your lead.
but with all due respect, sometimes our integrity is all we have.
if my views make me an unsuitable number two, I understand, sir.
when I asked you to take this position,
I told you I needed someone I could trust, wouldn't give me spin.
you're right, burton.
I won't cancel it.
all right, let's go!
move it!
let's go. Let's move it!
we're almost there!
keep it going.
give me a formation!
sergeant Hendrix, could I talk to you about my husband, sir?
and you are? - Roxy LeBlanc.
I'm married to P. F.C. Leblanc, I take it.
Yes.
look, I'm sure I'm breaking all sorts of rules here, but I have to.
see, Trevor's so dedicated to his training that he tore his feet up.
he can barely walk. His socks are all bloody.
and so, what should I do about it?
well, I made an appointment for him at the doctor tomorrow, and he won't go cause he has to train.
so, would you please give him the day off?
Oh, sure.
well, why doesn't he take the week off?
look, I feel responsible, okay?
He--Trevor hurt his knee tripping over our kid's toy.
just let him go.
you can have him right back.
I will take it under advisement.
what are you doing here?
making the first move.
look, I'm opinionated, and I got a big mouth.
I'm really sorry if I hurt you. Thank you.
I'm sorry, too.
I was gonna study, but why don't you join me instead?
look, I know you think I'm...
I'm pretty conservative and I don't have opinions of my own, but the thing is, frank and I have been married for 18 years and things have always been one way.
well, you're working at the hospital. That's something new.
Yeah, that was not easy.
I--Frank didn't marry a nurse.
he married a woman who was happy to quit nursing to be a wife and a mother
look, um, that other stuff...
I know you and Roxy think that I should make the first move, but that's also changing a big part of our relationship.
so... do you want to make the first move... sometimes?
Yeah.
I just don't know what he'll do.
you want my big, fat opinion?
okay.
you're afraid he'll leave you if you change too much.
but you can't stop changing.
so, if you don't tell him what you want, you could end up unhappy and wanting to leave him.
so, give the man a chance.
long day?
should I call someone and complain?
Yeah, you do that.
I have a surprise for you.
stopped by the P. X. On my way home from work, in your article was finally in.
I picked up five copies for the family.
that's great, Joan. Thanks.
honey, you really impressed her.
just listen to this.
with his self-deprecating sense of humor "and eyes that offer more than a glimpse "into this modest doctor's soul, one would never imagine "dr. Roland burton is one of the leading experts "on post-traumatic stress disorder, not to mention..."
are you being self-deprecating again?
no, I just need you to stop.
what? what?
what's the matter?
nothing.
what?
I'll send a driver for you for the memorial tomorrow.
I'm not going, Michael.
this one you have to do on your own.
Oh, Trevor, you look horrible.
you shouldn't have gone to sergeant Hendrix today.
you humiliated me.
Roxy, you were so far out of line, in like... a hundred different ways.
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help.
I know, but you just gave Hendrix another thing to ride my ass about.
do you know what the guys are calling me now?
Baby-soft.
okay.
I said I was sorry, Trevor.
I was just trying to get things back to normal for us.
Oh, now what is that supposed to mean?
we haven't had sex in three days.
something's gotta be wrong.
are you still attracted to me?
that's what this is about?
okay, just because we're not having sex every night doesn't mean I'm not attracted to you, 'cause I am
I'm being needy.
Yeah.
I've never been needy before.
I'm sorry.
I just haven't had the best relationships, you know?
well, this is a good one, in case you were still wondering'.
you have another problem, talk to me, not Hendrix.
okay?
okay.
okay. - okay.
I 'd never been with any man but you.
and I don't want to be.
cause I love you, Frank.
I love the way you touch me...
what it feels like when we're together.
sometimes... sometimes I want you so much.
but... but I shut it down.
because I don't know what you'd do if I just said...
Frank, I want to make love to you.
I didn't know if you were gonna show.
I'm glad you did.
thank you for calling.
you came to me for support, and all I did was let you down. I am so sorry.
thank you.
you know, I-I do understand how awkward it is for you, and I... you know, I probably would have done the same thing had I been in your shoes.
you are doing the right thing. - Am I?
because I'm beginning to feel like it's not worth it.
I'm a woman alone, taking on the united states army?
I don't think I have the strength anymore.
so, you're not gonna testify?
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
don't give up now.
you are this close to the truth.
it's what derrick would have wanted.
I hope you're right.
it's gonna be so hard.
but at least I have you by my side again.
Oh, god.
there's gonna be a lot of press there.
God knows I'm gonna need you at that rose garden ceremony today.
what I mean is Michael is giving a speech, and all the top brass is gonna be there.
you mean you can privately support me, but publicly you can't be seen with me?
that's a hypocrite, you know.
Hannah, you are one of the most important people in my life, and so is my husband
please don't ask me to make that choice.
save it.
we've been here before.
welcome.
Hey, you know, your kids l eft their skates in my toilet.
that's gotta be at least a 50-buck fine, don't you think?
she is talking to you. - yeah
I'm beginning to rethink that.
please be seated.
Hey, where's Claudia Joy?
the king's up there on his throne without a queen.
well, I just talked to her. She's not gonna make it.
but she's fine. - Don't worry.
I am honored to welcome you all here to the opening ceremony of the fort Marshall memorial rose garden.
this memorial honors all the fallen servicemen and women who have lived here on this post.
I'm going to list their names in alphabetical order.
there are over 100 of them, so please be patient.
specialist Matthew Adams.
private first-class Xavier Allen.
private Anthony Anderson.
sergeant peter Belgrade.
captain Steven billings.
specialist brady calls worth.
first lieutenant James Camden.
sergeant Troy S. Caldwell.

sergeant Thomas Ebner...
and I am here because I love my husband.
lieutenant colonel mark Wyatt...
I was an army wife for 22 years.
I want you to know that I believe in the united states army and all that it stands for.
my husband, lieutenant colonel derrick white, was killed in action two years ago.
he was awarded the silver star for heroism.
I was told that he died in Afghanistan by enemy fire.
now it appears he died in Pakistan by friendly fire.
no matter how he died, he is still a hero.
all our soldiers are.
our family just wants to know what happened.
I'm here to honor his memory by finding out how he died.
I'm here because I believe it is what derrick would have wanted.
we both believe in the united states army and all that it stands for.
my belief in the army has not changed.
I am here because I love my husband.
we have worked too long and too hard to get this post.
we're not gonna let it slip through our fingers.
how do you know about windfall?
Oh, we have our ways.
is everything okay? -Excuse me.
would you come with us, please?
how did you learn about project windfall?
I don't need to tell you that.
actually, you do.
your knowledge and open discussion of it constitutes a breach of national security.
I'm looking for someone to spice up the airwaves.
me?
we talk about us, the army wives, and what we go through.
you are on the air.
who is she?
the magazine reporter.
I think we should separate.
let's not make any hasty decisions.
let's sleep on it. -I'm gonna stay in a hotel tonight.
I'll call you in the morning. -Let's see how you feel in the morning.
coming through. Excuse me.
Hey, pick a side and drive.
Hey, baby.
you must be from Tennessee, 'cause you the only ten I see.
sweet. You can count.
just don't breed. Excuse me.
so where's Denise?
at the hospital, working.
I've got to call her first thing in the morning with the full report.
so what's this week's tribal meeting all about?
I don't know. Roland just said to meet him here at 9: 00.
Oh, there he is.
15 minutes late.
Hey, Roland.
Hey, ladies. Sorry I'm
late, we got it.
okay, cut the suspense. What gives?
uh, where's Denise?
working.
you know, maybe this isn't the right place.
Joan and I have separated.
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry, Roland.
when did this happen?
two days ago.
I've been staying at the Bellewind motel off the interstate.
I don't recommend it.
Why? Did she say?
uh, no.
no, this was my decision.
I thought things were getting better.
it's complicated.
you know we're here for you, right?
you are an amazing guy, and your friendship means a lot to me.
thank you.
if I can do anything
I'm not good enough for you, but he is?
excuse me?
it's okay.
look, we can handle this two ways.
you can turn around and-- ow!
No! Hey!
behind you!
Hey!
Pamela, watch out!
back off!
keep it off the bar!
why can't it ever happen in the parking lot?
Roxy, get back! -Get out!
Oh, Roxy!
is she okay?
let me take a look.
you were lucky.
the other guy was lucky.
I'd have cracked him upside the head if Pamela hadn't gotten in my way.
here.
you know, Rox, maybe it's time you stop working at the hump bar.
forget it.
I don't wanna worry about you.
you're the one deploying.
Roxy, I'm being serious.
Trevor, this was nothing.
look, when Bama played auburn, I carried a taser.
okay, who is gonna look out for the boys when I'm gone?
me and Pamela and some of the moms are splitting up kid duty.
look, I just wanna make sure everything is okay before I go.
it is okay, and I love you for making sure.
now give me those back.
the corn's colder.
I like the peas better.
unbelievable.
did I miss curfew?
I was beginning to worry.
roland needed to talk to us.
he and Joan have separated.
did you know about that?
no.
I knew that they had some problems, but I thought they were working it out.
Yeah, so did I.
how come you're home so late?
Oh, we went to a, uh, bar off-post, where Roxy works.
it's become something of a hangout for us.
a hangout?
okay, this is one of those things where the more I explain, the worse it gets.
Yes, this is one of those things.
it's really just been innocent fun until tonight
Claudia Joy, a brigadier General's wife needs to exercise a certain discretion in public.
I know, I know. Wait.
yes?
Yeah.
I got the call this evening.
public announcement's tomorrow.
Oh, Michael, I am so proud of you.
Hey, I couldn't have done this without you.
brigadier General Michael James Holden.
not yet. Not yet.
the promotion ceremony is next week. That makes it official.
but it does have a nice ring to it, doesn't it?
Yeah, it does.
at happened with General Baker?
retiring for health reasons.
and Lenore?
the army has dropped its investigation.
so they made a deal.
they had to.
this way, baker exits gracefully, and the army avoids a black eye.
did I mention I am so proud of you?
you did.
but you can mention it some more if you want.
I'm not supposed to be this way thanks for picking me up
you okay to drive?
I wasn't drunk, Joan. I was assaulted.
since when do you get into fights?
what happened?
I'm ready for this night to be over.
thank you for bailing me out, okay?
look, you're hurt.
why don't you come back home?
you don't have to stay in that hotel.
I appreciate it, but I'm checking out tomorrow.
I rented an apartment for the week.
I'll stop by in the next day or two to pick up a few things.
okay.
good night.
this is so amazing, dad.
Yes, Emmalin.
Yes, it is.
Oh, Michael.
Yeah, it's great, dad.
thank you.
girls, I appreciate your support.
look, I know that this can be a pretty demanding life, but when honors come our way, we all share in them.
does that mean we're gonna have our traditional "you did good" family dinner?
it's already in the plans, yeah.
listen, one other thing, girls.
along with this promotion comes increased responsibility.
I apologize, ladies, but your actions are gonna be under a microscope, more so now than ever.
you need to be mindful of your activities and your associations.
just use your head is all your father's saying.
congratulations, dad.
thank you, sweetie.
Yeah, congratulations, dad.
what's with her?
don't know. -Yeah.
I'm sure we'll find out sooner or later.
we have an official visit to make.
thank you so much for coming by.
I'll see you later. -Yeah.
Colonel Holden.
Hello, Lenore.
Colonel, Claudia Joy.
hello.
how kind of you to stop by.
of course.
is the general awake?
he is.
I'm sure he'll be thrilled to see you.
would give me a minute alone first?
sure.- Thanks.
well, I suppose congratulations are in order.
you won.
that's not how I look at it, Lenore.
nonsense.
an officer's life is all about competition.
don't deny it.
I was never in competition with you.
there's enough success in the world for everyone.
how noble of you.
no, it's not noble. It's a fact.
we both serve the same army, and it's a big army.
we didn't have to be rivals.
perhaps you're right, but it's quite a different view from the top.
you'll see.
how do you mean?
let's just say it's hard to know who your friends are.
in fact, it's hard to have friends at all.
I'm guessing that's gonna be quite a challenge for you, Claudia Joy, you and your--what?
colorful little assortment of friends.
but you will soon find out something's gotta give.
a little sweaty, but he's still pretty good.
Yeah. All right.
okay, that should do it.
my man knows how to work the pistons.
he's got the tools, and he knows how to use 'em.
all right. All right.
can we all come back from the seventh grade, please?
no.
thank you, sweetie. -You're welcome.
Yes. Thank you, sweetie.
you're welcome.
so I hear that radio gig's a permanent thing now.
Yep. I'm officially an unpaid employee of the U. S. Army.
Oh.
Oh, probably a fan.
more likely a collection agency.
Hello?
why, hello, soldier.
I missed you.
where is the cake?
Oh, they're at day camp.
yeah?
maybe we can pick them up together.
well, that'd be nice, but they don't get out for another hour.
an hour, huh?
Yeah, 60 whole minutes.
Amanda, we just got this from U. V. A.
you haven't signed up for orientation.
it was due last week.
I know.
you know?
honey, orientation's important.
you need to sign up for your classes.
look, mom, I've been thinking I might defer a year, not start until next fall.
what?
I'm going to go to college mom, okay?
don't worry.
this wouldn't have anything to do with Jeremy, would it?
it's--it's about life, mom, okay?
I just need some time away from school.
time?
time for what?
uh, I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.
okay, honey everybody gets nervous about college.
I know it's scary. It's
mom, you changed your mind when you were my age.
you were gonna be a lawyer, then you married dad instead.
I was 23, not 18.
Amanda, this is a big decision, not one you make on a whim.
fill this out.
Hey.
Hi.
what is it?
it's a want ad from the post newspaper.
for what?
a bookkeeper?
you do our books.
you help Betty at the bar.
you'd be good at it.
are you high?
seriously, you cod work on post.
you could make your own hours.
Hey, you could even work from home.
you sound like a commercial, Trevor.
call now. Receive your free steak knives.
you know, we could use steak knives.
you are one of the smartest people I know.
you could do anything.
you know the difference between a lawyer and an accountant?
an accountant knows he's boring.
I'm happy where I am right now.
are you staying home now, daddy?
Yep, for a little while, anyway.
but how long?
hard to say, Luke.
that's hard to say.
if uncle Sam calls, I gotta go.
who's uncle Sam?
the man daddy works for.
I thought you worked for the army.
uncle Sam is the army, bub.
there she is that her? - Eat your ice cream before it melts.
loved Monday's show.
you just keep telling it like it is.
thank you, ladies.
show? What show?
uh, yeah, I've been meaning to get to that.
what if I told you that I have this great new job where I get pay nothing for talking about everything?
uh, I would say back up and start again, please?
you'll understand better in about three hours.
why is that?
cause that's when I go on the air.
two broken taps, four busted stools, one video poker game and then there's the A. C.Unit.
what's wrong with the A. C.
someone landed on it.
someone big, and not "cuddly" big.
you have insurance, right?
the size of my deductible,
I got better odds collecting on the video poker game.
well, we're looking at a grand here, and it's a grand I don't have.
I'll cover it.
I threw the first punch.
it's only right I pay for the damages.
no, you were defending me, and Tennessee was spoiling for a fight.
let him pay for it.
this should cover it, and I'm sorry for the trouble.
no, it is an honor to know the last real gentleman in America.
and now I'm going to the bank before I wake up.
wow, is that from the fight?
Oh, yeah, it's nothing.
how are you?
embarrassed.
to be a hero?
don't be.
it's done.
Oh, good news about Michael Holden, huh?
what news?
general Baker's retiring, so Michael's the new post commander which means no more Lenore Baker.
it should be a national holiday.
Yeah.
I gotta go, Rox.
Thanks.
see you later.
you can leave the projections on the chair.
Hello, Joan.
I heard about Michael Holden's promotion.
I assume that means you're his permanent X. O. Now.
he hasn't offered it.
but he will offer it to you.
I hope so, yes.
so you'll take it?
why do you ask?
Oh.
I see.
you want to know if I'm gonna choose our marriage over my career, is that it?
Yes, Joan.
look, if there's a chance of us having a balanced life together
then I need to turn it down?
Roland, you told me it was over.
you are staying in a hotel, and now you are asking me not to take a promotion
I haven't even been offered?
I mean, what do you want from me?
you made it very clear the other night that we don't have a marriage anymore.
sorry.
Colonel, just dropped by to offer my congratulations.
Oh, thank you.
when you have a minute.
Yes, sir.
good seeing you, Roland.
same.
all munitions were accounted for prior to transport, sir.
fine.
I understand that you and Roland have separated.
two days ago, sir.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
thank you, sir.
if you'll excuse me.
uh, Joan.
sit down, please.
I appreciate that this is a personal matter, but it is my obligation to know whatever's going on with my senior staff, especially my X. O.
every logistical detail on this post goes through your hands
troops, vehicles, munitions.
I care about you, Joan, but this isn't about friendship.
it's about duty.
if you screw up, lives could be lost.
I understand, sir.
I know I pushed you to get here, and maybe too hard.
if it isn't the right time for this position,
I can recall Lieutenant Colonel Bring.
sir, with all due respect, the challenges in my personal life will not affect my performance.
very well.
thank you, sir.
it's been so long since I've seen him.
I'm not sure how to act.
he may want to be alone at first and decompress, just don't take that personally.
I'm not even sure what to wear when I meet the plane.
he doesn't care what you're wearing, honey.
he just wants to see you.
you have any kids, Margaret?
Mm.
no, not yet, but we want to start a family soon.
good, because you will have plenty of opportunity in the next week or two.
my man just came back and got a hero's welcome.
let me tell you, he knows how to shoot off the fireworks.
we're talking 21-gun salute, so stay hydrated.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, Joan. - Hey, Denise.
I almost didn't recognize you.
well, you know, um, masquerading as a civilian.
well, you look good. - Thank you.
um, good to see you. - Yeah, nice seeing you.
uh, how's major Sherwood?
uh, he's on notice. Expected to deploy this week.
Mm.
how are you doing?
I'm okay.
well, I heard about the separation.
I'm sorry. That must be hard.
Yeah.
look, I hope I'm not stepping out of line here, but are you really okay?
you guys are friends. We really shouldn't be talking about this.
Yeah, I understand.
um, you just seem like you need a friend.
thank you.
I haven't had a female friend since, uh...college.
it's either Rolandor the guys I serve with.
well, you're in a unique position.
it can't be easy.
I just hope that you guys can work through this.
I mean, every marriage has its rough spots.
Yeah, I know, but, um, some things, once they happen, you know, they're--they're hard to get past.
I should go.
good to see you. - Yeah.
Bye. - Bye.
you wanted to talk? - I did.
I will admit, it's not easy for me seeing you grow up, Amanda.
I still remember you riding on my shoulders.
daddy.
what?
whatever you want to say, just say it, please.
your mother told me about your plan to skip college this fall.
it's not a plan. It's a possibility.
okay, "possibility." Whatever it is, I don't like it.
you worked hard to get in, Amanda.
you should go.
but... I recognize that I can't force you.
thank you.
but if you don't go, I will expect you to work.
you're gonna have to cover clothing, gas, personal expenses.
I will not support you merely hanging out at home.
is that it?
Yeah.
you don't want to say anything?
what is there to say?
okay...
What'd I miss?
I liked it better when she argued.
mommy's home!
and I got dinner. - yay, dinner! Mom's here.
Hey, go get plates.
did you listen to the show?
uh, I did. Yeah, I listened.
And?
I want the chicken leg. - I call the drumstick.
what?
"shooting off fireworks"?
I can't believe you said that, Pamela.
come on. It was a joke.
well, yeah, it's not a joke when you talk about our sex life on the radio.
I mean, it seemed like I'm just here to service you.
well, aren't you?
what we do in private is private.
okay?
the guys in delta are gonna have a field day with this.
look at me. Look at me.
you humiliated me.
think about it.
would you like me talking about you like that on the radio?
okay, Mr. Plan-for-the-future, I took your advice.
yeah?
Ta-da!
what's that?
that is Roxy's bar and grill.
it doesn't look like much, I know, but with a little paint, a little sweat, she'll clean up rele nice.
you are out of your mind, you know that?
so you tell me, but look, my mama had one.
that's how she got Marda's bar and hair salon.
so from now on, I'm gonna take 10% of my tips and put 'em in that jar for a down payment.
then we can get a loan on the rest, and I have you to thank for reminding me to be responsible for my dreams.
Yeah.
what is it?
wow, it's--it's great, Rox.
But?
the army is my job.
I thought you understood that.
I do. We wouldn't buy it until after you finish your term.
tour. - Whatever.
okay, Rox, there is always gonna be another tour.
what do you mean?
I mean we're always gonna be moving, every two or three years, wherever the tour is.
I mean, we can be in Louisiana, Korea, Germany.
look, the point is, we're never gonna beany where long enough for you to settle down and open up a bar.
I thought you understood that.
no.
guess I didn't.
I mean, I knew the army would be our whole life for a while.
I just didn't think it would be forever.
well, he's a career guy.
I can't believe you didn't have that conversation before you got married.
sorry. I forgot who I was talking to.
so when you married Chase, you knew that this was it?
Oh, yeah, but you never really know until you're in it.
something wrong?
it's stupid, uh, but chase didn't like my radio show yesterday.
you mean the "21-gun salute"?
Yeah. Yeah.
so what are you gonna do?
well, it's not exactly like
I can go on the air and apologize, so I don't know.
that's what I mean, Rox.
kind of hard to keep your identity here.
Hey, Roland.
you didn't return my call.
Oh, sorry. Busy day.
no problem. I was just free for lunch.
no, I should--I should get home.
Hey.
is something wrong?
I talked to Joan the other day, and...
look, I don't really want to get in the middle of this, but she was hurt.
did she say anything?
she didn't have to. You could just tell.
um...
Roland, she said something happened, and I gotta tell you, it--it sounded like she meant an affair.
it was a one time thing.
Why?
I've been asking myself that same question.
Roland, god.
you're my friend, and I support you, but you cheated on your wife.
I know.
it's been all of us and you...
and...
and now I'm just another man.
um, yeah, for the centerpieces, let's stay simple.
tulips and Gerber daisies
and not so tall that people can't see over them.
my, my. Planning your husband's promotion ceremony already?
you certainly don't waste the "21-gun salute"?
I stopped by to put this in your box, but since you're here...
it's just a few tips, like how I knew General Grayson loves pralines.
Oh, great.
how thoughtful of you.
general Hartnett's wife did the same for me when I took over.
well...
I've got a thousand things to do.
I know we've had our differences, Claudia Joy.
Yes, we have.
but look at you.
you're beautiful, well-educated...
it just seems like everything comes so easily for you.
that's not necessarily true.
Oh, come on.
some of us just aren't as privileged as others.
I have had to work hard for everything I've gotten in my life.
you've achieved a lot, Lenore.
I mean that.
I just hope now that you're retiring, you can enjoy it.
Oh, I'm not retiring, dear.
general Baker is the one who's quitting, not me.
I don't understand.
we're getting a divorce.
Oh.
I'm--I'm so sorry.
don't be.
he never appreciated anything I did for him anyway.
I'm looking forward to whatever comes next.
so, um, better run.
good-bye, Lenore.
surely, you know there are no good-byes in the army.
that should do it for the day.
thank you, sir.
Colonel Burton.
that's not possible.
no, I'll handle it. I'll be right there.
here you go.
detail, double time going to the crew chief.
Yes, sir.
give me a hand.
captain Bright? Lieutenant Colonel Burton.
what's wrong with the vehicles?
they're supposed to be up-armor Humvees.
well, they're not, and you signed off on the order.
let me see that.
all right, my mistake.
options?
we have to cancel the flight.
wrong, we can't do that. Ma'am, we don't have
how much time do we have?
six hours till wheels up.
I can get you the right vehicles here within the hour.
we need 12 hours turn around. You know that, colonel.
captain, it is vital that we get this equipment to Baghdad international.
now we're gonna have to work together to make that happen.
I'm gonna get on the horn to motor T.
I'm gonna be with you every step of the way until we're loaded.
you got that?
Yes, ma'am.
good
okay, let's get moving.
Hey, the kids are at Roxy's.
I thought I would take you to dinner and make up for going on the air and telling the world that you are my sex machine.
I'm the one who's sorry.
here. Here you go.
okay, what's gotten into you?
well, I was embarrassed, and I, uh, overreacted a little.
and I'm suspicious.
okay, all right, I'll give you that, but, look.
I went to work today, and I had no idea that so many people listened to your show.
And?
well, let's just say I'm now known as the "big man" on post.
wait a minute.
your delta buddies listen to the show?
Yeah.
they said they secretly learn about their women from you.
okay, so now it's okay because I gave you props in the man department?
does that make me shallow?
Yeah, I think so.
well, in that case, there's only one thing you gotta do.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
Mm-hmm. Live up to the hype.
I... saw your car in the driveway.
Yeah, I'm just here to pick up a few things.
is this a good time to talk or do you still need space?
I'm just trying to figure things out.
by yourself, Roland?
I need you to have some patience, Joan.
I did when I waited two years for you to get home.
Yeah, but you couldn't wait 30 days while I was in treatment.
I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated.
Roland, I made a huge mistake at work today because I can't concentrate.
I'm too worried about what's gonna happen with us.
look...
can't we make this work?
when we got married, I put my life on hold for you.
and now I need to start doing the things that I had in mind for my life.
I understand that, but what do you wanna do that we can't do together?
I told you, I want to settle down and have a family.
now if you take this promotion, you know we can't do that.
that is so unfair, Roland.
you know what an opportunity this is for me.
and I want you to take it, Joan. I do.
you earned it, but is it unfair for me to want to be a father?
or to want my wife to be a mother?
I'm tired, Joan.
I'm tired of fighting.
I'm tired of fighting, too, Roland.
let's just call this what it is.
it's not a separation.
it's a divorce.
kids are sleeping late for once.
I'm sorry.
I just assumed you knew how I felt and I was wrong, but we're a family, and we need to make these decisions together.
does that mean you won't be in the army forever?
we'll have to see.
and I rise and fall again here's what I do know.
whatever the future is,
I want it to be with you.
when I'm overseas, this is what I'm gonna be remembering this moment.
right here right now.
mom, dad.
what is it?
Amanda's not in her room.
what? - Where is she?
I don't know where, but her makeup and her toothbrush are gone.
did you know about this?
no, I swear.
no messages. She'll call. I'll call her friends, see if they know anything.
this is the last thing I need right now.
I know. I'm calling Fort Benning.
if she's seeing Jeremy, I want to know about it.
Emmalin, not a word of this to anyone, you understand?
Yes, dad. - All right.
Wow. The place looks good as new.
Yeah, thanks to your friend.
oncologist, St. Luke's, M. R. I. S.?
what's this all about?
the doctor found a lump last week, and they took a biopsy, and it wasn't pretty.
you didn't tell me about that.
well, it's no big deal until it's a big deal.
now it's a big deal.
what are you gonna do?
die, probably.
nobody gets out alive, kid.
well, aren't you gonna fight it?
I would, but...I don't have any money.
I don't have any insurance, and we're talking thousands here for surgery and chemo.
I'm so sorry.
do me a favor.
name it.
go take care of table number three over there, okay?
sir.
I understand there was a little excitement at the air field last night.
minor snafu. All taken care of, sir.
good.
look, I can only imagine how painful it is separating from your husband.
I'm ready to commit if the job were offered, sir.
well...
welcome aboard.
thank you, sir.
we could put, uh, Major Masello at table three with Captain Richards.
uh, not a good idea.
what? Why?
charity golf tournament
the Major's wife called the Captain's wife a "balding clown..."mm.
and then the flying bagels appeared.
okay, fine. Uh, we'll put the Masellos at table six.
that should do it. - Are you okay?
Oh, why do you ask?
well, the flying bagels deserved some sort of response.
Amanda's gone.
she went to see Jeremyat Fort Benning.
are you sure?
Yes, Michael had Jeremy's battalion commander call us as soon as she arrived.
I'm sorry. I know this is a lot.
for both of us, it is.
that's not all, Denise.
what is it?
Lenore Baker told me something before she left.
don't listen to her.
she said it's hard to know who to trust when you're the commander's wife.
well, we knew you before you were the commander's wife, so you know you can trust us.
all right, Masellos at six.
Burton? With us up here at one.
um, yeah, probably next to us.
Dr. Samuels, thank you for calling me back, sir.
listen, I've been thinking about your offer, and I'm very much interested.
uh, no, Thursday's fine, provided I can get a flight to Chicago.
great. I'll e-mail to confirm.
Yes, sir, I think a position at northwestern could be exactly what I'm looking for.
Oh, no. I am grateful for the opportunity.
thank you.
in New York City, there's a fine line between law and chaos.
on that line live Danson and Highsmith.
tell me again why I decided to get on this roof!
I think you can chalk that up to bad life choices.
get rid of that asshole.
Uh-oh! I hate it when you say "uh-oh"!
come on with it, then!
that's trouble.
did someone call Nine-One-One?
that's it. I'm sick of all this running.
hang on!
you have the right to remain silent!
but I wanna hear you scream!
down on the ground!
detective! Yeah, yeah! Detective!
one at a time, all right?
Yeah, Detectives, Rick Grayson, New York Observer Online.
these suspects were caught with only a quarter pound of marijuana, a misdemeanor in some states.
do you think this arrest was worth $12 million in property damages?
why don't we let New York City answer that question?
the greatest city on Earth, yeah!
Hi, Sarah Gapone from TMZ print edition.
Danson, are the rumors about you and Kim Kardashian true?
no comment.
but, yes.
Danson and Highsmith, free hot dogs for life!
no drinks. No drinks. I can't do it. I can't do it.
Danson and Highsmith shoot, drive, and sex with style.
they're rock stars.
then you got your jokers, your ball busters, your vets...and the other guys.
we know, we know. We know.
all right, all right, all right. Listen up, listen up!
we're having a celebration tonight at Butter.
Brody Jenner's gonna be there. Bai Ling.
that little short bitch from Jersey Shore. Yeah!
and most of you are on the list.
you're the best.
guys, I'm gonna say something right now.
it's about a man who came from Austria with a dream.
arnold Schwarzenegger! Let me finish.
he became a champion and then a movie star, all right?
arnold Schwarzenegger! God damn it, let me...
they ruined the story. They ruined the story.
Let...What...The point is, we couldn't do our job if it weren't for you guys doing all the paperwork, answering the phones, and all that stupid shit that we don't like to do. All the gun fights all the car chases all the sex we don't wanna have with women, but we have to, all due to what you guys do. Thank you.
and we'd do it again and again.
Hey, you shut your face!
if we wanna hear you talk, I will shove my arm up your ass and work your mouth like a puppet!
you hear me? You hear me?
cash bar. Yeah.
peace out, bitches.
Hey, fellas. All right, bring it in.
come on. Bring it in a little bit.
all right, right there.
just back up, just like right there.
all right, just one...Just a...
there you go, right there. Right there.
this is their paperwork. You know they're not gonna do it.
that's right. This paperwork is like Bob's wife here.
it's thick, ugly, got Danson's fingerprints all over it.
no offense, Bob. That's all right.
anyway, now who wants it? I do!
all right! Paper Bitch and Yankee Clipper on the case!
nice work. Thanks, Allen. Thank you, Captain.
I'll do it! I'll do it!
stop humming that song!
I can hum if I want to. No, I know you can.
I'm asking you to stop.
well, if you're asking, then I'll stop. Thank you.
could you not smile like that?
now you're asking me to mask my emotions because of how it makes you feel.
that I will not do.
seriously, stop humming! Okay?
this isn't accounting or wherever the hell you and your little pocket calculator were transferred from.
forensic accounting, okay. And it's an important part of the job.
Yeah, whatever.
stop being so overtly happy about doing shit work, you moron.
Hey, guys. Reminder.
the police union picnic's coming up this weekend.
my wife's making her famous deviled eggs, again. My waistline's furious.
it's a bad time, Bob!
all right.
going to get a slice.
you know what I just did?
I just walked out that door, saw a couple detectives, and I was about to start bad mouthing you behind your back, but I stopped myself, because my pops taught me that a man who talks behind somebody's back is a coward.
wow, I actually appreciate that.
good, 'cause I'm gonna tell you directly to your face.
no. You don't have to. No, I don't like you.
I think you're a fake cop.
the sound of your piss hitting the urinal? It sounds feminine.
if we were in the wild, I would attack you.
even if you weren't in my food chain, I would go out of my way to attack you.
if I were a lion, and you were a tuna, I would swim out in the middle of the ocean and freaking eat you!
and then I'd bang your tuna girlfriend.
okay, first off, a lion swimming in the ocean?
lions don't like water.
if you'd placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source, that'd make sense.
but you find yourself in the ocean, 20-foot waves, I'm assuming it's off the coast of South Africa, coming up against a full-grown, 800-pound tuna with his 20 or 30 friends?
you lose that battle.
you lose that battle nine times out of ten. And guess what?
you've wandered into our school of tuna, and we now have a taste of lion.
we've talked to ourselves. We've communicated.
yeah? And said,"You know what?
lion tastes good. Let's go get some more lion.
we've developed a system to establish a beachhead and aggressively hunt you and your family.
and we will corner your pride, your children, your offspring. How you gonna do that?
we will construct a series of breathing apparatus with kelp.
we will be able to trap certain amounts of oxygen.
it's not gonna be days at a time, but an hour, hour 45, no problem.
that will give us enough time to figure out where you live, go back to the sea, get more oxygen, and then stalk you.
you just lost at your own game. You're outgunned and outmanned.
did that go the way you thought it was gonna go?
Nope.
two minutes before the markets open,
Pamela Boardman, CEO of Lendl Global, ringing the opening bell.
with Boardman is investment banker, David Ershon, who manages 40% of Lendl's $70-billion equity pool.
how much did we lose?
you may ring the bell now, Ms. Boardman.
$32 Million?
no, billion.
shit!
Chinatown. Three Triad gang members. I popped two of them off the draw.
bang, bang. Yeah.
then I raise up to take the leader out.
shit, I feel like I'm there now.
I hear a whistle. My partner's on the roof.
he tosses me down a Mossberg pump. I send one through his chest.
game over, bitches.
all right. Yeah.
Jimmy? Let's talk about how that story made you feel.
like my cock was made out of concrete.
I know it's very tempting.
you want to impress your friends.
but this is serious stuff we're dealing with, okay?
this is firing your weapon in the line of duty.
officer Hoitz?
Oh, man.
come on! Here we go.
would you like to share?
no, I'd rather not.
officer Hoitz, you've been coming here for six months now, and you haven't said a word.
this is a safe room, no judgment here.
jerk-off.
that's judgment, Jimmy. Come on.
I relive it every night.
bronx, October. Game 7 of the World Series.
for all the marbles. High pressure, unruly crowd, and I pulled tunnel duty.
I mean, I saw a shadowy figure in the tunnel. I told him to stop.
whoa, whoa, whoa, this is a restricted area!
finally pulled my gun.
pulled a deadly weapon. He started running at me.
don't make me shoot! I'll do it!
are you deaf? You hear me yell, "Freeze"?
you dick! I'm Derek Jeter! You shot me!
you cost me 20 grand on that game! Douche bag.
cost the city a championship.
I was being groomed for a top position in homicide.
now I'm stuck with a desk jockey partner.
everybody calls me the Yankee Clipper.
because you shot Derek Jeter!
he's a biracial angel.
you should've shot A-Rod.
yo, Paper Bitch.
what's up, man? Hey. Hey, guys.
paper Bitch. Paper Bitch.
I don't like that, actually.
I know you guys think it's fun, but I don't like that name.
still working on the Danson and Highsmith paperwork?
shit. No, actually, actually, that's...
what is this? That looks stupid.
guys, it's illegal permitting for construction.
specifically, scaffolding.
some of the guys were talking.
they were like, " How come you've never fired your weapon in the office before?"
good point.
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
you've never fired your weapon in the office.
we all have, you know. It's called a desk pop.
fellas, look, I know you don't respect me as a police officer.
not true. I'm not stupid.
I'm not gonna discharge my firearm in the office.
gamble, listen to me. I'll try to make it real clear.
we honor the flag, and you crap on it when you don't shoot your gun in the office.
Jimmy. When's the last time you had a desk pop?
september '08.
be a man. Do it. Now.
please, please, do it. Pop one off!
there you go. Pop it off! Don't think, just go!
here we go. Do it, yes.
he did it!
Hey! Shots fired!
Hey, Terry, I did it! I did my first desk pop!
it's a real thing, right?
a desk pop? Yeah.
no, that's not real!
they were so convincing in their argument, they swung me.
all right, Allen, you're gonna have to hand over your gun.
Yes, sir.
captain, you really wanna disarm this guy, take out the batteries in the calculator.
all right, I'm gonna give you this. This is a dummy gun.
I use it for ceremony.
there.
you get this back when I feel you know how to handle it.
listen, guys. I'm working two jobs. I'm working here.
and I got another job at Bed Bath and Beyond. Okay?
I'm doing that just to put a kid through NYU so he can explore his bisexuality and become a deejay.
now the last thing I need is a ballistics report in the unit.
I'm just gonna ask you guys, please, come on, really.
just think about...Just be smart.
they're using a wrecking ball to clean out Castien Jewelry.
all right, we got it.
good luck, guys. Have a good one. Allen, let's go.
no, I got work to do. What? This is work!
Hey, yo! Danson and Highsmith. We roll in heavy.
you cream puffs, sit tight.
you gotta be shitting me!
you can't keep me cooped up in here, okay?
I am a peacock! You gotta let me fly!
did he just...Did he just call himself a peacock?
let's go! Let's go!
come on, fellas!
wednesday night is taco night at Rikers Island!
that's the second one this week!
Hey, you monkeys! Stop!
let's go!
Yeah!
heads up!
shit.
special Forces zip-line.
cut that line! Cut it! Let's go!
these guys are pros. Let's go!
you thinking what I'm thinking, partner?
aim for the bushes.
cops still argue to this day why Danson and Highsmith jumped.
maybe it was just pride, having survived so many brushes with death.
maybe their egos pushed them off.
I don't know. But that shit was crazy.
either way, there was a hole in New York City, and it needed to be filled.
two days ago, this city wept.
we lost two heroes who gave everything for us, who paid that ultimate sacrifice so that we may walk these streets safely.
there wasn't even an awning in their direction.
no, I know. They just jumped 20 stories.
doesn't make sense, does it?
I only hope God lets them take their guns with them to heaven.
it's our moment, Allen.
our moment to step up and be the guys.
we're at a funeral. Show some respect. What?
you don't think every other detective here isn't thinking the same thing?
allen, listen to me. Danson and Highsmith are gone.
their desks are empty. Someone has to fill those seats.
that someone is us, okay? The city's dying for a hero.
is it? Yeah.
what about nine million socially-conscious and unified citizens, all just stepping up and doing their part?
as a little kid, didn't you dress up and play cops and robbers?
I'll tell you what I did as a little kid.
I went to school and made my bed.
and at age 11, I audited my parents.
and believe me, there were some discrepancies, and I was grounded.
what the hell are you?
well, well, well. What do we got here?
look at these two jamokes, would you?
one shot Jeter and the other shot an office.
have some decorum. We're at a funeral.
you wanna dance, Brolio?
you'll be pissing blood out of your ass.
that's horrible.
why don't you step back, man?
you touch him, I swear to God I'm gonna beat the shit out of you with Allen's head.
he's not gonna do that. That's hyperbole. But that's a weird example.
you wanna go? I wanna go!
get him off. Kick his ass, Martin.
Yeah. How do you like that?
pull his hair! I love it.
this hurts so good.
very sorry for your loss, ma'am. What a lovely hat.
I love your shoes.
it's fine, it's fine. Go, go.
punish him!
Oh, man.
do it. That's how we do it in the hood.
punish him. That's not even a move.
I'm the winner. I'm the winner, everybody saw it.
what the hell is going on here?
two good men are dead, you guys are fighting over who's gonna be the next hotshot?
is that what's happening?
Yes, that's exactly what's happening.
let me tell you something.
sorry for your loss, Lorraine. Very sorry.
sorry, Lorraine. Sorry, Lorraine.
Hi, I'm Jimmy.
too soon? Why'd you say that?
I'll tell you something about those guys.
they knew that to become a good cop, you had to solve cases. Okay?
okay, and maybe you start with the Castien robbery.
okay? So just watch it.
next time, me, you, library.
not even close. Come on, guys. Guys, come on.
you are...I'm the winner!
I didn't need you to stick up for me, okay?
I could've handled that myself.
Hey, don't flatter yourself. It's the partner's code. I had no choice.
move.
9: 15, let's have a great day, everybody! Cut the shit!
good morning.
we've got shots fired. 509 East 10th Street.
there are large amounts of cocaine on the scene.
try to stay out of trouble, boys.
there's no chance you'd wanna go on that call, right?
no chance. Too busy.
all right, ladies. Starting to get the picture?
we're about to lock shit down.
that's right. You girls stay here and get your type on.
go get them, guys. Lot of energy, lot of focus.
shut up!
allen, could I see you in the hallway for a second?
I...I'm super busy right now, Terry.
no, no, no, I know. This'll be real quick.
it's about the construction permits you were talking about.
the scaffolding violations? This is our thing, yeah.
so, what do you got?
I got this! I'll put one right in your neck.
what are you doing?
let's go. We're going to that call.
what is this? Shut up.
we're going to the car, and we're going after this case.
you're not gonna shoot me. I won't?
no. I shot Jeter.
that was an accident. Was it?
now move. Okay.
Hey.
does anybody see this? He's got a gun on me.
I'm being kidnapped.
really, we're in a police station and no one is interested in this?
so, then what happened? What do you think happened?
I woke up, I took the belt off my neck, and I got in my car, and I got out of there.
talk about a wild weekend, right?
I thought I was gonna have to shoot my way out.
what are you gonna do, though, you know? Bar mitzvahs.
what the hell is this?
it's my car. It's a Prius.
I feel like we're literally driving around in a vagina.
detective Hoitz and Gamble are on that 518 on East 10th.
Negatory, Martin and Fosse, two minutes out.
we'll just see who's there first.
you stay out of our crime scene! You hear me?
go, go, go!
you feel that, Allen? That tingling in your balls?
big metal butterflies fluttering around in your stomach?
are you sure you don't have testicular cancer?
I got something to get you going.
let's go do some damage!
Nope.
what the hell is that?
lrb. Little River Band.
you know what? We go with no music, okay?
fine. Say bye.
no, no, no, don't say bye...
you just signed your own death warrant, Hoitz!
allen, punch that accelerator or I will shoot you in the foot!
America!
Allen! Allen, hit the brake!
seriously, slow the car down! We're approaching the crime scene!
Terry, I'm coming in.
you're gonna smash right through the tape! Allen!
dude! What...
that's a lot of cocaine.
did you yell "America" when you hit the accelerator?
Nope. No. No.
I've never actually put my foot all the way down to the ground with the accelerator like that.
it got me slightly aroused.
here we go.
way to put your stamp on the crime scene, guys.
prius, huh? Yep, yep.
good mileage?
outstanding. Yeah.
did this come with a dental dam?
no. Get it?
I didn't know they put tampons on wheels.
we've had our fun, huh?
looks like Scarface sneezed on your car.
all right, everybody!
I'm gonna need you all to back up now. We're taking over.
at the crime scene, LOL.
good tweet, good tweet. Yeah, thanks.
america has always been defined by its excess.
the Grand Canyon, professional sports contracts.
Wendy's Baconator, extra bacon.
I myself have 18 Lamborghinis and a Subaru station wagon.
and it's because of this excess that I have flourished.
I implore you, please, do not stop profiting.
live for excess. It's the American way.
hello.
Mr. Ershon? I believe this call's for you.
sir David.
David. You're not returning my calls, so I'd like you to meet Roger Wesley.
G'day, mate. Hey.
Roger and his team are gonna babysit you because I don't trust you, because I think you're going to take off.
Pamela, this is ridiculous. I'm not going anywhere.
David, listen, the Lendl quarterlies come out on the 26th.
you have until then to give me my money. I'm not reporting any losses, David.
I have zeroed in on a new investor.
well, then, you get their money, make it disappear, and then pay us back.
Yes, yes, I'll tell him he doesn't need to keep watching me.
David! Okay, sweetheart, bye-bye.
Yeah. She overreacted. She's a woman. So, you're good to go.
heard everything, mate.
ladies and gentlemen, guess who gave me the secrets to making my first billion dollars.
that man there.
go! Go!
side! Step aside, please.
you don't think I'm a real cop, do you?
no, I don't. I've said that directly to your face numerous times.
I was really honest about that.
I'm working on a huge case, all right?
property owner with seven buildings under construction.
he hasn't applied for a single scaffolding permit.
now, according to Ask Jeeves, this perp is at the Plaza Hotel speaking right now.
that's your big case? Scaffolding permits? Yeah.
guess what? You're coming with me.
it's a wooden gun.
that hurts, man!
I've always got Little River Band loaded up here.
I've got six disks in here.
Claude, meet me outside, at the back of the service entrance.
I'm flying Air Singapore.
Hey, Douglas. How's the wife? She died.
Attaboy!
I'll be there in two minutes exactly.
another thing I hate about you? You always pay in exact change.
you're just mad because I have a nice change purse.
why do you even care?
how can I help it? You know what? You know what's worse?
the way you fart. Even your farts, they're not manly.
you're being ridiculous.
they sound like a baby blowing out the candles on a birthday cake.
what? Like a little...
you know what bugs me about you? What?
I'm pretty sure you've never voted.
no, I vote. Sports radio, AM 880. Play of the week.
you're like a child in a leather jacket. That's what you're like.
get out of the way, man!
wait. Are you David Ershon?
Yeah, well, it's Sir David Ershon, but I don't bother with the...
anyway, little bit of a rush, gentlemen, if you don't mind. Thank you.
excuse me, but you're under arrest, okay? What?
you have the right to remain silent. Anything you do or say can be used
what's the next part? As a floatation device.
as a floatation device.
you know what? That's very funny. I have never Miranda-ed anyone before.
Really? Are you guys for real?
am I being punk'd?
detective Allen Gamble.
we are in a cocaine-covered car, and we are bringing in a perp.
one David Ershon. 175 pounds.
thank you. 175 pounds. Shut up, man, shut up!
martin and Fosse are probably on Studio B talking to Shepard Smith right now.
we arrest this jerkoff for a scaffolding permit?
wait, wait, wait, what am I being arrested for?
for scaffolding permit violation...
I got my insurance card. Somewhere. Easy, mate.
what the hell? You ran right into us! Stand over there.
wood?
what the...Couldn't see the car. It's big enough, mate. What?
do not let these men take me.
Hi.
Why's she looking at you like that?
that's my car!
Hey, hey, hey! We didn't exchange insurance information!
Hey! Excuse me!
why did they take our shoes?
what the hell just happened? Where's my iPhone?
I think we've walked 30 blocks, man.
I don't get why we can't just call the office and have a squad car come pick us up.
no. They took our shoes, our guns, and our car.
there's no way that's going out on the radio.
look, if we're gonna do this together, there's some issues we need to settle, okay?
I mean, you said I had a weak chin. You said the way I pee is feminine.
how do you think that makes me feel?
I mean, that list you have, you put a lot of thought in. It's weird.
I hear you.
let's clean the slate right now. Fresh start.
all right. Fresh start.
maybe we should call ourselves the Febreze Brothers, 'cause it's feeling so fresh right now.
right?
let's do another fresh start, 'cause I just wanted to punch you in the face.
fine, fresh start.
it's the last one.
I have to be able to express myself and say things, you know.
okay, folks! Everybody, listen up! Listen up!
got a high profile kidnapping.
david Ershon, wealthy banker, multinational team.
maybe a sleeper cell, but it's too early to tell.
Hey, Bilbo Baggins. Where are your shoes? 'Cause your feet are black.
who cares? It's not important, okay?
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain. Not good.
Bye, guys. Bye-bye.
come on.
guys, this is Don Beaman, the attorney for Mr. Ershon.
Roger Wesley, head of his private security.
Hey, how are you? You son of a bitch! Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, Terry! Take it easy!
that's the guy who took our guns, Captain.
and my shoes! Wait a minute, wait a minute.
did you identify yourselves as police officers?
what is this?
allen, tell me. Did you? No, we did not.
sorry, gentlemen.
we thought you were abducting Mr. Ershon.
it's only protocol.
Mr. Ershon has agreed to correct this scaffolding situation.
the case is closed.
I've taken care of all necessary paperwork.
and you fellas, at this point, should just be glad that Mr. Ershon is not pressing charges for excessive use of force.
thank you, Captain. You bet.
Australian?
special Forces, right?
best watch your step, Detective.
there are three things I love in this world.
kylie Minogue, small dimples just above a woman's buttocks...Beautiful features...and the fear in a man's eye who knows I'm about to hurt him.
Hey! Shake your dicks. This pissing contest is over.
come on, man.
all right, look, they returned your shoes.
and they returned your weapons. Here you go, Terry.
allen, someone was nice enough to put linseed oil on it, some kind of stain on that, dark walnut or something.
you might wanna think about dropping them a thank you note.
okay.
you're mad at us, huh, Gene?
first off, don't call me Gene. I'm your captain.
guys, do you remember the "Be Smart" speech?
sure. All right.
well, what did you do? What'd you do about it?
the opposite. We were not smart, Captain Gene.
it's just "Captain."
just "Captain." It's not "Captain Gene." I don't have a kiddie show.
that sounds creepy, "Captain Gene."
police mistakenly arrest investment banker, David Ershon.
was he the victim of financial profiling?
financial profiling? That's crazy.
he broke the law and we arrested him.
that wasn't a security team. He said, "Don't let these people take me."
I mean, when you hear hooves, you think horses, not zebras.
what about donkeys or deer?
they have hooves. What about bovine creatures?
were you just thinking to yourself, "Fresh start"?
Yeah. Yeah. I could see it.
listen, why don't we just go over to my place?
we'll talk the case down.
we can have a little dinner. You can meet Sheila.
two cops talking down a case while eating food, all right?
it's not dinner. Fine.
and let me apologize in advance, okay, in case my wife acts like a world-class bitch.
she's a big old broad, and she likes to wield it.
okay, so I put together a little bio, complete with pictures of Mr. David Ershon.
I used Adobe Premiere. I like to do a little weekend editing.
I recently just cut three minutes out of Goodfellas.
david Ershon is currently the CEO of Ershon Consortium.
who's that talking?
it's the Frontline Narration App. It's only 99 cents.
Ershon Consortium, current financial investments exceed $70 billion.
his largest clients include Schering-Plough and Lendl Global.
Lendl Global has those TV ads where I can't figure out what they do.
Yeah, oil, media, health care, you've probably heard their jingle.
Lendl Global, we're in everything
david Ershon is often found in the company of Judge Scalia...
Yeah. And the lead singer of Maroon 5.
I mean, this guy could be connected to drug cartels, black market organ sales, human trafficking, all of it.
how do you get that from anything I just said?
Hey, guys! Soup's on.
what do you mean?
Hi.
Hi. You must be Terry.
I'm sorry I've been hiding, honey, but this dinner was tricky.
who are you? I'm Dr. Sheila Gamble, his wife.
come on, seriously. Who is that? His old lady.
sweetie, it's a workstation. Got it.
and you come in here, dressed like a hobo, it's distracting.
I know you're working. I'm so sorry.
come on, seriously. Come on, what?
who is that?
that's the old...That's the old ball and chain.
get over here.
not...not right now. Okay.
look, they're not all first-round picks, okay?
come on, are you gonna tell me who that is?
are you really Allen's wife? I know.
people are shocked because he's Episcopalian and I'm Catholic, but somehow it works.
are you gonna change? I already did.
it's no big deal. You look really, really nice.
Terry, you don't have to be polite, okay? She looks kind of shitty.
don't speak to her like that, Allen.
look, if I put that in my Cosmo Fashion App, you'd probably get a D-.
allen and his apps. He loves them.
you know he's designed three of his own? One of them...Can I tell him?
one of them, you can take a picture of anybody's face, and it'll tell you what the back of his head looks like.
Faceback. Faceback.
got some horrible reviews coming out of the gate.
it's gonna hit. It's gonna catch.
why are you with Allen?
I mean, that's not what I meant. I meant, how did you guys meet?
it's a really typical "how we met" story, Terry.
you're gonna be bored by it.
I was a dancer for the Knicks while finishing my residency at Columbia Hospital.
allen came into the ER with poison ivy on his rectum.
Yes.
needless to say, I fell for him immediately.
we immediately spent the next three days at the La Quinta Inn, and, to be honest, we didn't speak. Three days of not communicating once verbally.
we had actually, without knowing it, developed a language of eye flutters and non-verbal gestures.
you know, Terry, it was just this primal connection.
after those three days of non-verbal communication and a whole lot of loving, I had to go to a specialist to get my hips realigned.
similar to operating on a German shepherd when they have hip dysplasia. Very painful.
it's funny, it's like a scene from that one movie, always forget the name of it.
with Meg Ryan. Yes.
I don't remember a movie where Meg Ryan meets a guy with poison ivy up his ass.
I'll think of it. I'll think of it. Okay.
so, what about you, Terry? Do you have a girl?
I did, yeah.
we were supposed to get married, but she backed out. It's complicated.
Terry shot Derek Jeter.
shut up, Allen. This was before.
that's okay.
she's Got Mail. That's the name of the movie.
that's it! Honey!
with Tom Hanks? Right.
and Meg Ryan. Meg Ryan.
he didn't have poison ivy up his ass.
Yes, he did. Yes, he did. Yeah.
way up there.
well, Terry, can't thank you enough for coming by. What a...What a wonderful, lovely evening. Thank you.
it was so, so nice meeting you, Terry.
it was my pleasure. Thank you.
and remember, all I ask of you is, you don't let him get hurt, Terry.
she tells me that every day before I leave. Yep, I do.
I come downstairs and I make him his fresh-cut strawberries, and I say, " Listen, my little sugar balls, whatever you do today, you just don't get hurt."
Yeah. Every morning.
and then I show him my breasts, and I say," These are waiting for you when you get back home." Right.
you know, Terry, they're not the biggest breasts he's ever seen, but, man, are they perky. Not by a long shot.
and they are firm, and they are yours. You're a nice lady.
thank you for coming.
detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Over.
go for Hoitz.
we found your red Prius. Great.
it was trying to vote for Ralph Nader.
come on. Okay, sugar balls, listen up.
there's gonna be fingerprints on that car.
tomorrow, we're gonna run those fingerprints through the system.
and if we get a hit, this case is gonna heat up faster than a junkie's spoon.
you do one thing when you wake up tomorrow, bring it.
okay. Thank you, Sheila.
he'll bring it.
good night! Good night.
thank you, Sheila.
Bye, Terry! Bye, Sheila! I'll never forget tonight.
Bye, Terry! All right, Allen, whatever. Go inside.
Bye, Sheila!
night! See you...See you, Terry!
Bye, Sheila.
I don't know if he heard me. Bye, Terry!
Bye, Sheila!
well, here she is. They left her under an overpass for the night.
you find anything?
Yeah. We found a lot of stuff.
from bodily fluid and hair samples, we determined that a bunch of old, homeless dudes had an orgy in the car.
Oh, God. Yeah.
you know what that's called when they do that in there?
that's called a soup kitchen.
it's pretty rough stuff.
not long after that, a mama raccoon came along and gave birth on the floor.
placenta blew out all over the back window there.
Yeah, and then to top it all off, some joker comes along takes himself a nifty little dump in the driver's seat.
I think he knew you guys were cops, because this is what I would call a spite shit.
you were able to determine all of that from the hair and fluid samples? Oh, yeah.
what about fingerprints? You find any fingerprints?
Nope, couldn't get a one. Found a cell phone.
Yeah, that's mine.
any signs of a struggle or spent shells?
no. Believe me, everybody that was in on this orgy was more than willing.
in fact, they even left you a note here.
thanks for the F-shack. Love, Dirty Mike and the boys.
here's something we found.
we found about a dozen unscratched lottery tickets.
no fingerprints or nothing. Check that out.
Yeah, it's a real shame, you know.
I got myself a Prius. It's a hell of a machine.
it's my first brand-new car. I've never owned a new car.
found a deer vagina.
what? Thought it was human lips at first.
then we took a closer look. It was definitely a deer vagina.
not even a free ticket.
what are we gonna do?
we got no fingerprints, a bunch of losing lottery tickets.
look at this, there's a two-minute phone call made after we were jumped.
they used your phone? They ghost dialed.
someone probably sat on it.
it could have recorded some of their conversation when Ershon got grabbed.
we gotta hear the other side of that call.
Nope, no, it's nothing.
nothing? It's nothing.
it's the only lead we have. It's nothing.
why did you just get super jumpy?
what?
it's an ex-girlfriend, okay?
what's the matter? What happened with you guys?
she was just a bit of a handful, that's it.
allen, it's the only lead we have.
we either go with this or we walk away from this case right now.
fine. Let's go see her.
Hello, Christinith.
Hello, Allen.
that's my partner, Terry. Hi, Telly.
holy shit. Dude. Just relax, relax.
I waited for you in Tower Records for four hours.
that was 13 years ago.
arnold Palmer alert. Arnold Palmer alert.
who wants some Arnie Palmies?
sweetie, this one has the vodka, right here.
Hal, just place it down, please. All righty.
okay.
I did things in bed with you that I haven't done with anyone since.
no.
Christinith, your husband, it's awkward.
Oh, no, he knows all of this.
you're a lucky dog. It's true.
Christine, this is a lovely house.
it's Christinith. Are you stupid, or are you deaf?
Christinith, you idiot!
you come to our house, you get my wife's name right!
what? Christinith!
look, we really appreciate the hospitality.
we'd just love to get the message off your cell phone.
we believe it might give us information regarding a kidnapping.
okay. Why don't you come to the kitchen, and I will let you listen to it and everyone else stay here.
okay, sweetie. Come on.
there's my phone. Great, thank you for...
I hate you, you son of a bitch!
you're so strong. I'm stronger than you will ever know!
I hate you! I hate you!
you're so adorable. Look at your face. Look at your face.
you go,"I wuv you." Say it. "I wuv you, Cwistinith."
you probably think because of the beard that I'm really hairy.
but I'm not.
shaved.
Allen! He's fine.
question.
what would you rather be, a bear or a dog?
I don't care. I wanna be a bear dog. Half dog, half bear.
cause that way, I could live in the house but I still get to make a doodie out in the woods.
Allen!
Allen! Allen!
this is police evidence. Terry! Let's go! Hey!
you get back here and you make love to my wife!
Allen! Allen!
I don't get it, man. I just do not get it.
I mean, that girl Christinith was seriously hot.
your wife is crazy hot.
I mean, even that Brazilian security chick, she threw you a "Do me" vibe.
what is it with you and hot ladies?
first off, my wife is cute, but she's not hot.
dude, you're insane. Your wife is scalding hot.
you wanna listen to this message or not? Yeah, whatever.
you have one job, mate.
find a sucker to invest with you so you can pay my boss back the money you lost.
and I don't care who.
right. I actually think I found a sucker...
he's talking to Ershon. ...to invest $32 billion.
who's got $32 billion to rob?
once I get the money, I'll falsify the records to show their massive losses and then repay your employer.
now, since you're following me, I need to go to 2300 Park Avenue, and after that...
I told you it wasn't a security team.
he was being abducted. Obviously, but what kind...Holy...
nobody leaves our house without making love to my wife!
is that him? Yeah!
Oh, my God, they came out of nowhere!
holy shit! They chased us 20 miles.
you come back here! You get back here! Allen!
2300 Park Avenue. It's the offices of the lottery.
holy shit, the lottery tickets we found.
Ershon is using the lottery money to cover his losses.
$32 billion. That's the state's money.
well, what do we tell Mauch? A guy lost some money.
we have a scratchy cell phone message and an address.
it's still half a case.
there's gotta be some sort of paper trail.
if we can find that, if we can track it, then we can go to Mauch.
so, I did some more research on Ershon's accounting firm, and I found some pretty interesting stuff.
it turns out that Gretchel and Dawson has...
hold on, I'm up.
I gave my love to Erin
she promised to be true
I went to war to come back，and find five British soldiers had their way with her
it was consensual
done?
Gretchel and Dawson Accounting Firm in Fair Lawn, New Jersey has only one client, David Ershon.
pretty rinky-dink operation for a guy like that.
looks like we're going to Jersey to visit an accounting firm.
that's a shitty day.
and all their fathers were hanged
and the children all got pink eye
while their Harry Potter books were burned
do you have fun singing those songs? They're really depressing.
I do. They're full of rich history.
damn it, I'm late. I was supposed to go meet my lady.
I thought you said you guys split up.
let's just keep our thing about work, okay?
all right. Goodbye, buddy.
Hey, get off me, man.
what the hell are you doing?
I'm dancing, Terry. What the hell are you doing here?
I love you, Francine.
if you were with me, you wouldn't be here in this strip club, shaking it for dollar bills!
this is a ballet studio, Terry. Okay? These poles are horizontal.
he loves you very much, Francine.
who is this guy? What are you doing here, Allen?
it's the code. I'm your partner.
I'm here to support a friend and a work colleague.
Francine, is this guy bothering you?
who's this, your new boyfriend? Great. You got a new boyfriend.
he is my dance partner, Terry. Okay?
I know that this is a big surprise, but there are other things in the world besides being a cop. Okay?
now, if you will excuse me, I'm gonna dance.
what, you don't think I can do this shit?
that was surprisingly good, Terry.
I love you, Francine. You don't know what love is.
he loves you very much, Francine!
I heard it when he said it. Thank you.
you know what you're doing to me? You're killing me inside.
and don't eyeball me, man!
you're running around with this crack-dealing drug addict?
Terry!
he does not approve of your behavior!
can you please go?
and you, too, creepy guy standing in the door?
let's go, Allen.
I think we all experienced our own ballet today.
the ballet of emotion and feelings.
you're kind of making things worse.
you okay? Yeah, I'm fine.
Hey, I didn't know you could dance.
we used to do those dance moves to make fun of guys when we were kids, show them how queer they were, okay?
you learned to dance like that sarcastically? Yeah, I guess.
stay out of my personal life, okay? The kid flies private.
stay focused on the case, man. I'll see you in Jersey tomorrow.
all right, Terry.
Hey, that was liberating for me. I don't know how it felt for you.
here, check this out. Article from six months ago.
talking about how the lottery is looking to invest their $30-billion fund more aggressively.
so he's dealing drugs?
no, it's not drugs. This isn't Miami Vice.
look, I'm sorry. I just...I am in a bit of a state today. Sheila and I got into it last night.
what happened?
she was interested in taking this class at The Learning Annex, right?
called "The Art of Oral Sex"?
you know, we just don't have it in the budget right now.
it's always about her.
Yeah, that's...That's messed up.
Hey, I got you a gift.
I just saw something, and I thought of you, and so, I don't want it to be weird.
I just wanted to be nice.
of course it's weird.
it's a grown man giving another man a present.
there you go. Open it up.
it's okay, you're welcome.
I like to do things like that.
take a look what it says.
female Body Inspector.
you know, because we're both in law enforcement.
we both like women.
but I got a weird sense of humor. I'm a sick puppy.
I can't look at it. It makes me laugh so hard.
me, too.
real nice. You know, it's all class.
okay. Don't do that shit any more.
Yeah, believe me, I won't.
do you understand what's so funny about it, though?
cause it's the FBI, right? It has the same logo, the same shield.
and at first glance, you're like, it's just a mug that says "FBI."
but then at second glance, you're like, "Female Body Inspector"?
get out of town. This is outrageous...
shut up!
I'm gonna climb over that anger wall of yours one of these days, and it's gonna be glorious.
shouldn't we tell Mauch that we're going to check this place out?
for what? We're just going to check it out.
I know, but it's procedure.
Terry answers to no one.
I do what I do.
what accounting firm is closed at 11: 00 a. m. On a Tuesday?
this is a shithole.
I love bombs.
I can't hear! I can't hear!
there's blood blisters on my hands!
Oh, my God!
how do they walk away in movies without flinching when it explodes behind them?
there's no way! I call bullshit on that!
when they flew the Millennium Falcon outside of the Death Star, and it was followed by the explosion, that was bullshit!
don't you dare badmouth Star Wars! That was all accurate!
I need an MRI.
I need an MRI! I've got soft tissue damage.
there's no way I don't have soft tissue damage.
please stop.
I just wanna go somewhere and breastfeed right now!
fire Department said it was a gas leak, but no way. That was timed.
they didn't wanna kill us, but they wanted to scare us.
Yeah, well, they succeeded, okay?
I'm tired of this. All right?
I'm tired of explosions and people pointing guns at me.
I wanna go back to my desk.
guess what? Life gets loud sometimes and messes with your ears.
you can't escape it by hiding at your desk for your whole life.
you know what? Yes, you can. I've done it for years, okay?
there's no explosions at my desk.
there's no explosions at my home with my plain wife, in my plain house.
what are you afraid of, man?
I'm your partner. You can tell me. What the hell are you hiding from?
I was a sophomore in college.
the university I went to decided they needed to raise tuition.
a classmate of mine, Brenda, in an effort to raise money and stay in school, came up with a nifty plan where she thought she'd date guys and charge them money.
I go on dates all the time, with a whole bunch of, you know, boys and stuff.
and I kind of need somebody to help me out, like, you know, my partner in crime.
Yeah, I could make a schedule.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I was thinking.
provide transportation services. Yeah, yeah.
it's gonna be a good time. Thanks so much for asking me.
she said she needed my help to make sure that the dates went okay and that the guys paid her. She said she'd give me a percentage.
Oh, my God. You were a pimp. What? God, no.
no, I was just trying to help a friend.
we started making a lot of money.
and wouldn't you know it, some of Brenda's girlfriends decided they wanted to be a part of it.
pretty soon, there were about 14 ladies that I was protecting while they gave me money.
that's called a stable of whores.
we decided I shouldn't use my real name.
so we came up with the name "Gator."
I'm telling you, you were a pimp.
No! Are you even listening to the story?
anyway, one day, I wake up and I look in the mirror, and I don't like what I see.
I mean, I had gotten out of control, and I didn't even realize it.
you can't have a conscience in the pimp game.
one night, two of my favorite girls, Candy and Jolene, said, "We gotta take you in," and they dropped me off at the emergency room.
that's where I met Sheila. I was a mess.
I made a promise to myself and to her that I would never get out of control again.
so, as soon as I graduated from college, I became an accountant for the police department.
the most stable job I could think of.
an accountant for law and order.
I just don't wanna ever feel out of control like that ever again.
don't worry. I got your back.
now I say we go get in Ershon's grill and see if he cracks.
I'm tired of all this tippy-toeing around. Okay.
you can either walk the plank or take your panties off.
the choice is yours.
I want to take my panties off.
you've made a wise choice, you have.
Mr. Ershon, Detective Gamble and the officer who shot Derek Jeter are here.
gentlemen, please.
remember us, hotshot? Of course I do. Please, sit.
there she blows.
two of those Russian waters, please. No lime wedges, just cucumber.
guess where we just came from? An explosion at your accounting office.
Yes, that awful gas leak.
gas leak?
the only gas leak is the one coming out of your mouth right now.
I just thank God no one was hurt or injured in a bad way.
I absolutely abhor death.
Hey, Andrew Lloyd Webber. The jig is up, okay?
we know that wasn't your security team that grabbed you.
and we know you're targeting a big fish to cover losses.
you talk or I beat you so it don't show no bruises.
God, this water is good. Terry,
have you tried the water? Shut up Allen
I assure you I have no idea what you're talking about
I understand there was a bit of a mix-up with the whole scaffolding business.
the cucumber accents the water in such a way that...
perhaps by way of apology, I can offer you my personal courtside seats for the Knicks game, with access to the Ambassador Club.
come on, Knicks! Come on!
I got Knicks' fever and it's catching!
Hey. This feels weird sitting here. It feels like it's a bribe.
it is a bribe. Son-of-a-bitch, I saw courtside and I went blind.
come on call me
excuse me. That was a trick.
no more
gentlemen, you have a choice. Mamma Mia or Jersey Boys.
fantastic! You're so unbelievable!
damn it. He did it again.
excuse me. No more tickets.
Mr. Ershon, I tried to keep them in the waiting room.
that's okay, Susan. Two Glacier waters with Mediterranean limes.
no, no, no. No more water. We're not here for that.
no, I was very much looking forward to having a water.
how great is Jersey Boys? It's not great. It's fantastic!
you totally undersold it. The pageantry, the costumes.
wow, what a musical.
Hey. Get over here.
what's wrong with you? What?
that's not what we're here for.
we're gonna do good cop, bad cop. Okay?
it's the oldest game in the book for a reason, it works.
I come strong, then you come in.
you got it? Yeah.
I come strong, then you come in. Right. Got it.
now you listen to me, you piece of shit.
it's just you and me, and I'm gonna rip you apart!
how did you cover your losses up?
what drug cartel are you working with now?
okay, I'll talk to you, you're reasonable! No, no, look at me!
you wanna talk to me? You wanna talk to me?
allen, what are you doing? What are you doing? Allen!
I'm gonna make you eat a plate of human shit!
get away from me!
where is he?
look, I'm really sorry about that.
I saw how aggressive you were being, and I thought,"Wow, I gotta go even bigger than that, since we're doing bad cop, bad cop."
what? No, I said,"Good cop, bad cop." I'm the bad cop, you're the good cop.
okay, then there it is.
that's it. I thought you said,"Bad cop, bad cop."
well, while you were going crazy, look what I snagged from his desk.
think it's his phone sheet. Nice.
seven calls to the lottery office.
that could be the evidence we need for Mauch.
get back. Colombian drug lords. Where are you getting that from?
Jeesus
can you imagine where you'd be in your career if you hadn't shot Jeter?
we call this in, right?
looks like we got all the evidence we need.
I'm sorry, my butterfly.
we'll load them up, send them back to go.
holy shit. What?
what do you mean, what? Where are we?
we're in the high desert.
they took my shoes again, man! What the hell is it with taking shoes?
they took your wooden gun? Yeah.
Hello? Hello, Gene? I mean, Captain.
captain, it's Allen Gamble.
Yeah, yeah. Where are you? What's going on?
captain, it's a long story, but I'm just gonna cut to the chase.
we are in Las Vegas, all right?
we were kidnapped, put on a freight train, and shipped out here.
let me just stop you right there. Don't bullshit me.
captain, I am being straight with you.
look, we think something's going on, okay?
we think Ershon is targeting the lottery to cover his losses.
wait. How many times did I explicitly say to you,"Lay off Ershon?"
Terry, Captain wants to know how many times has he asked us to lay off of Ershon.
twice.
twice. Terry says twice. I agree.
I'm hanging up. I'm done.
I gotta tell you, I started getting a hand for that, a taste for that Pai Gow.
martin and Fosse, super cops, in three, two...
so, we busted that junkie. Got back 74 thou in diamonds. 74 thou.
solved the Castien case.
$74, 000? That's all they took?
there's millions of dollars of diamonds in that place.
how about this, Gamble? How about you shut your face?
all right? Just shut it.
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain's looking for you.
I know it's off the subject, but is Kevlar copyrighted?
captain? Yeah.
is it a bad time? No, come on. Come on.
not me, right? Yeah, and you.
fellows, I'm sure you're familiar with the venerable DA Radford.
he wanted to come down and pay us a visit.
Hello, gentlemen.
Hello, sir. Hey.
you know, I was talking to Gene here. He prefers "Captain."
Yes, I was talking to Gene here, and, you know, it's funny.
I don't know what you two have been up to, but I've been getting calls from people I don't ever get calls from.
in 40 years of enforcing the law, I've learned one thing.
when that happens, stop.
gene, how's the family? Good, good, Louis, thanks for asking.
my son's bisexual, so... Tremendous.
gentlemen, do we understand each other?
cut the crap! Will do.
guy never comes down here.
twenty years, I think I've seen that guy in this building one time.
he's a heavyweight cat, that guy. He was sitting right here.
Yeah. I think you missed the point. Anyway, look. Blue and white found your firearms down by the Hudson River.
here you go, Terry.
you know what?
I'm gonna hang on to the wooden gun.
to give me back my real gun? No.
cause I'm gonna give you this.
it's a rape whistle. You blow that if you run into any trouble and someone with an actual gun will come and help you out.
we were abducted, Captain! This shit is real!
Ershon's dirty. He's targeting the lottery!
next, I want you guys to hand in all the evidence you think you have to the SEC.
the financial district's under their jurisdiction.
don't you get it? This case is talking to us!
I'm a peacock, Captain! You gotta let me fly on this one!
you know what, Terry? Let's just settle this. Peacocks don't fly.
they fly, they fly a little bit. Yeah, about as much as a penguin.
one more thing, do me a favor, don't go chasing waterfalls.
was that accidental, or were you trying to quote TLC on purpose?
I don't even understand the reference.
you don't understand what you said? I don't know what that is.
get out. Go.
how did they get that story?
I'm tired of being treated like a jerk for trying to do the right thing.
Hey, guys.
there's a proxy vote for a big reinvestment of the pension coming up, so if you just wanna come by the old... Damn it, Bob!
let me ask you something.
what do you even do around here besides interrupt people?
well, I serve as treasurer to the union.
I make a wicked pot of decaf.
Exactly! You're a worthless piece of shit!
probably right, Terry. That's why I feel so sad all the time.
I'm gonna go for a walk.
Bob! Say something.
come on! Bob!
I didn't mean it, all right? I'm upset.
actually, we don't do that here. This is an installation art piece.
this coffee table? Yes. We don't put drinks on it.
five hundred thousand? He can read! Congratulations.
what? I'm sorry, are you in the right place?
or not? I'm...
Terry. Does he... Okay.
well. Sorry. Terry! What are you doing here?
I want to be with you. No, Terry, that's not gonna happen.
you know where you belong. On top of me in the Poconos.
instead, you're here selling dirty coffee tables?
I mean, look at this. This is nonsense!
Terry, this is an original Haverfield-Jameson.
the chaos of the coffee table? It represents our fractured egos.
you think I don't know about this artsy-fartsy crap?
this coffee table isn't the ego.
it represents our shattered sense of community in the face of capitalist-driven isolation.
looks like the work of Cindy Sherman or Frank Stella.
how did you know that, Terry?
I took some classes at RISD so I could make fun of these lame artsy douches in my neighborhood.
Terry, lower your voice! I don't have to lower my voice.
is this man bothering you?
are you actually having sex with this creep?
Terry, he's gay. Okay?
he's even wearing a T-shirt that says,"I'm gay"!
all right? And also, he is my boss.
happy for you, man. Good.
can you get out of here now? I'm talking to my lady.
Mr. Reger, everything is fine. Terry is actually leaving now.
nice toot, sailor. Jesus.
Terry, what are you doing?
look, I waited three years for you to be more than a cop, okay?
just give me one more year.
Terry, you don't get another year. I'm done.
fine.
Terry, don't touch that! Terry! Oh, my God!
I don't need this shit. I don't need you!
and when you call me, I'm not coming back!
Oh, boy! Over the top! How outr?
I'll burn this bitch down to the ground!
fresh! Energetic! I love his rawness!
stop critiquing me, okay? I'm a human being! I'm not a piece of art!
Yes, you are. Bravo!
I'm a peacock flying into a rainbow!
Yes! Yes!
these braised short ribs taste like a dog's asshole.
sweetie. You know what, I'm sitting here thinking, "Who in the world would slow roast a dog's asshole and serve it to their husband?"
you would. You are being awful. What's wrong?
captain took us off the case. I'm sorry.
I told Terry about my dark days in college, and it brought up some feelings.
well, honeydick, that was a long time ago.
you're not that same person you were.
no, you don't get it. There is a darkness inside of me.
it wants to get out. It wants to walk around.
it wants some walking around money, and it wants to buy some shoes.
and it wants to walk up with the people and say,"Hey, Gator don't play no shit."
you feel me? Yeah.
gator never been about that, never been about playing no shit.
sweetie, I'm sorry. It's okay.
I just...Remember that night we met?
the attending physician told me,"We got a drugged-out pimp in the back."
and I went back there, and I pulled open that curtain, You were weak, scared, ass up, inflamed, crying.
at that moment, I knew.
Hey, he's no pimp. Pimps don't cry.
pimps don't cry
pimps don't cry
no they do not
they don't shed a tear
pimps don't cry
they never shed a tear
come lay with me.
be safe, and let's make love. Come on.
every time you say,"Be safe," it tears me apart.
you gotta let me be who I'm gonna be.
allen, I'm pregnant.
whose baby is that?
who's the man who did that to you?
gator's bitches better be using jimmies!
I'm sorry. See, that's what I'm talking about.
Oh, my God.
you need to leave.
get out! Get out, Allen! Get out!
hey
Hey. What are you doing here?
come here when I have lady troubles, which means I come here about every night.
what are you doing here?
Sheila and I got into it tonight.
she threw me out.
well, you're not a cop till your wife throws you out of the house, partner.
does it bother you that the Castien robbers only took 74 grand in diamonds?
they're junkies. Who cares? I mean...I don't know if a junkie can go down a 20-story zipline, though.
how are you going?
we're about to have us a little screw party in this red Prius over here if you wanna join us.
you're not going anywhere near that Prius, okay?
here's what we're talking about. We're talking about a bunch of hobos with fingers in each other's pooper in a stranger's car with talk radio playing really loud.
it's gonna be a nice evening.
well, we're not participating in that. We have no interest.
let me rephrase it.
we got a jar of old mustard, and we got a poodle, and we're just get in there and we're gonna put some D's in some A's.
Hey, are you Dirty Mike and the boys?
how do you know who we are? You left a note in that car.
police, shithead. He's a copper. We gotta go. Come on!
Hey! Goose it, boys! They're cops!
rub your dicks on the car as you're running away!
you turned my beautiful Prius into a nightmare!
we are gonna have sex in your car! It will happen again!
I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight.
fortunately, I know where you're gonna be drinking.
Jack of All Trades. Drinks on me. Come on.
no, I already have a beer. No, no, no, no.
I'm talking about doing some serious drinking. Drinking with Terry Hoitz.
this sucks, man. Work our ass off on this case, now we gotta hand over all of our evidence?
Yeah, it's not right.
Oh, my God, I'm hungover.
so, you guys are law enforcement?
Yeah, we're an independent government agency who, along with the FBI and the Federal Reserve, regulate the stock market and corporate fraud.
and the Federal Reserve is a prison?
no, basically, it's a held-for-profit bank that sets interest rates and loans money to other banks.
is that a wastebasket? Yeah, right there.
thank you.
you all right? Holy hell!
I'm so sorry.
I got so drunk last night.
I think I thought a tube of toothpaste was astronaut food.
come on in, fellas.
you gotta be kidding me. You're Ershon's lawyer.
we're turning over our investigation to you?
let me assure you there will be no conflict of interestewx between me and David Ershon.
and if this were an actual investigation, I would immediately recuse myself.
this is all the evidence we have, and I truly hope you take this seriously.
Yes. Very much so.
from everything I've heard, I understand you guys are the best at these types of investigations.
outside of Enron and AIG and Bernie Madoff, WorldCom, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers.
okay. Thank you. Thank you, Detective.
would you like a seat, or you're fine? No, I'm good.
okay. Let me just assure you fellas, David Ershon is an upstanding citizen.
I am playing squash with him tonight at the club, and we're having dinner.
you listen to me, you Windsor knot-wearing monkey, you play squash with Ershon, right?
your kids go to school with his?
how would you know if he's clean or not?
I will take a look at your evidence, and I will take a second look at the financials.
and when I come back and bust your ass, we're locking David Ershon in the Federal Reserve!
he still doesn't understand the concept.
what are you doing?
we just handed all of our evidence over to the bad guy's lawyer!
are you a big man, huh?
I'm talking to you. What?
you wake up in the morning, you say,"I'm putting on my big boy pants?"
look, I'm wearing a belt!
I've got big boy pants on! No!
you borrow a little jacket, you go?
you take your lunch 'cause you got big boy pants on?
you got your big boy pants and your snack?
I could say big, loud things!
I could be demonstrative!
stop! We don't, we don't do this!
you're scaring the shit out of me, man! Stop it!
is this how you conduct yourself? In a democracy?
what the hell are you doing, man?
I'm so tired of you getting angry and yelling all the time.
it's exhausting.
I feel like I'm partners with the Hulk.
you wanna know why I'm so angry all the time?
cause the more I try and do right, the more I screw things up.
we've got a possible jumper at 3 World Financial Center, 23rd floor.
all units, fire department, en route.
sec. Beaman's office.
we have to go.
but the Cap tain.We have to go, Allen.
all units, I need a respondent.
possible jumper, 3 World Financial Center.
shit. It's Beaman!
he's gotta know something. Wesley!
detective Hoitz and Gamble. We got this.
I took an online class at University of Phoenix on negotiating.
I'm gonna need a priest and a bullhorn.
I got no bullhorn. Does anyone have a bullhorn?
bullhorn, anyone? Truck.
police business. I need to use your PA system.
okay, let me turn it on.
Mr. Beaman? Mr. Don Beaman?
it's Wesley. I know Ershon's Wesley's...
look, there's a lot to live for in this life.
a lot of great things, like soda pop, big fresh can of soda pop.
they do not care!
give me this. I know how to talk to him.
listen, we all know you're a scumbag, and nobody cares about you.
rotten piece of shit.
that's worse than what I was saying.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Don.
people down here are starting to murmur that you don't have the balls to do it.
I don't care! Yeah.
I say you can do it.
I mean, I don't want you to jump.
I'm just saying you have the capability.
look, he's flying!
stop that.
half empty bottle of gin. Chair knocked over.
look at this, it's a clear sign of a struggle.
make sure you get this, all right?
detectives, all your work's done here. You can go.
what about Ershon targeting the lottery?
you know why Ershon was calling down to the lottery offices all those times?
because he was hooking up with the Powerball girl, the one on TV with all the numbered balls.
Yeah. She filed a restraining order on him last week.
it was right there in front of you the whole time.
can't be. You guys are getting transferred.
what? Traffic.
Yeah, that's right.
you, you're gonna walk a beat downtown.
you're gonna walk a beat downtown.
it's done. No. Captain, what are you talking about?
no, no. It's done.
save yourselves some gas. Captain!
is there an appeal process we can...
had to do what you had to do, Captain.
Wow! That hurt.
excuse me. Where's my car? They towed it.
couple of homeless people were messing around in it.
that's an official police car. Could have fooled me.
wow, Mauch was upset, huh?
Really?
the only thing I had to be proud of in my life was being a detective.
that was all I had. Now it's gone.
I know. I know. You still got me.
don't you get it? I don't want you, Allen, okay? I never did.
I told you that scaffolding violation was dogshit.
I can't believe you still doubt me after everything we've seen.
it's a real case, and I'm a real cop.
we just got the wrong target for Ershon.
you carry a rape whistle. This is real cop work.
there is nothing about you that makes a man a man, okay?
you got no gun, no car, no wife, and now you got no partner.
leave me alone.
a mutt case.
Terry, I am a cop, for your information, okay?
a broken partnership.
I'm a cop!
and getting busted down to a shitty assignment.
allen and Terry hit the trifecta.
but sometimes when you get your ass kicked, that's when you find out what's real...and what needs doing.
whether it's directing traffic...
come on!
...or cracking a multibillion dollar fraud.
do you work here? Yeah, I do.
the wrecking ball that crashed into Castien down there.
they also did damage to your office?
some police officers came by and sealed it off.
do you recall what they looked like?
one of them had an Australian accent.
you don't happen to do any business for the state lottery, do you?
no. Our main client is Lendl Global.
can I ask what this is about?
traffic ENFORCER OF THE MONTH
Terry Hoitz
gator needs his gat, you punkass bitch!
cause that's what a real cop is.
no, I didn't say Lock her up. I never said, Lock her up.
a guy who does what needs to be done.
a guy who knows how to use his dark side for good.
and then you move to Florida.
one, two, three, attack!
Terry, it's me.
tap out. Tap out. It's me, Allen.
are you tapping out, or are you hitting me in the face?
I'm tapping out!
you crazy? What are you doing, man?
they might be watching us. Could've killed you.
turn out the lights. What?
they could be watching us. Who?
I found some big information, okay?
about what? Some scary shit, Terry. This is big.
how'd you get in here? This place is foolproof.
we can't be too careful. What are you talking about?
this place might be bugged. There's no bugs in here.
first off, I missed you.
what's going on? Did you hear what I said?
fine, I kind of missed you, too. Thank you.
okay. I found out whose losses Ershon has to cover.
it's Lendl Global. What?
Lendl staged the Castien robbery as a distraction so they could break into their own accounting firm next door.
they then altered all the records to cover the losses that Ershon had cost them through all of his bad investments.
you're not supposed to be doing this.
you're supposed to be walking the beat.
I know. Pretty tricky, though, huh?
this is bad, Allen. This is bad.
no wonder the captain wanted us to stay out of this.
Yeah, I bet Beaman started asking questions.
that's why they killed him. Man.
here's the other thing.
tomorrow, there's a massive business deal going down.
Ershon's leading it.
I still can't figure out who the poor sucker is they're making the deal with, but we gotta stop it.
it's time to let the peacock fly.
I'm not going, Allen. I like what I do.
so do I. We're cops.
no. I like what I do now. I like working traffic. It's a great gig.
what?
I like working traffic. I'm not going with you.
what is this traffic bullshit?
what are you talking about? I'm talking about my life.
the corner I run on 54th and 3rd Avenue? It hums.
it's Terry's intersection. And the traffic guys? They're good guys.
there's this one guy, Phillip? He can pee in the urinal from 20 feet.
you've gotta see it, Allen. You've got to.
what happened to you? What happened to this being our time?
no way, Allen. I'm out. I'm done.
get in the car. Come on, Allen. We both know it's wooden.
apartment pop. Now get in the car. You're not gonna shoot me.
okay, I'll be honest. This is only the second time I've ever fired this.
so stop pointing it at me.
look, tomorrow morning, all I know is I'm going to Mauch, all right?
for what? He doesn't care.
he's been dodging this case for too long and I want answers.
I want him to look me in the eye and tell me why.
turn on the news, man. Nobody cares.
I hope I'm not alone.
hope you bring it.
we got a big day out there. Big one.
we got a full moon. People are gonna be amped, all right?
let's see what we got on hot tips, all right?
the new bathmats are in.
one more thing. We got a serial rapist in Crown Heights.
jeez, I'm sorry. That's from my other job. Ignore that. Forget that.
well, don't ignore it.
if you live in Crown Heights, you know, walk in pairs.
gene Mauch to kitchen accessories.
gene Mauch to kitchen accessories.
I gotta go. Go get 'em. Let's be careful out there.
the oak.
I like to keep the oak together and the maple separately, okay?
and these chopping boards?
Hey, Captain.
Hey, Allen. Hey, how you doing?
what are you doing here? Are you here for the bathmats?
I need you to be straight with me. Straight with us.
Hey, Terry. Look at this.
I thought you were working traffic today. Let them block the box.
besides, partners' code, right? Thanks.
Hey, why have you worked your ass off trying to kill this case?
all right, fine. I'm gonna tell you guys something.
you really went into deep water on this one. You really went in deep.
Ershon's connected to all the higher ups, and I gotta save what little ass I have left, okay?
you keep hiding from shit in the world, and eventually the world comes to your front door.
nice. That's very nice.
I heard it in an episode of Touched By An Angel.
you keep this thing real quiet, and you make sure you have real evidence, and maybe I'll see what I can do.
but if you make a lot of noise and you attract the media attention, and you bring the DA in on this,
I am out, okay?
Yeah, we'll go in there like church mice.
but there's one case, one case in a career where you go all in. This is it.
all right. Then you do us proud.
cause I don't want no scrubs.
Really? No.
you're not aware that's a TLC song?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
second time. You said chasing waterfalls, now you're saying you don't want no scrubs.
I don't even understand the reference. It's like a tic.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
remember, this thing gets messy, we never talked.
you can trust us. Real quiet.
you gotta creep. Creep.
come on.
you don't say "Creep-creep" unless you're quoting TLC.
Hey, guys.
you know Danson and Highsmith were not good cops, right?
Yeah, I guess we kind of knew that, but it's a drag.
I mean, at a certain point, who's left to be a hero?
not to be corny, maybe it's you guys.
you ready?
Yeah. Let's go.
no, but the highlights are great. Thank you.
sexy but serious. Thank you.
excuse me.
who the hell are all these people? I was only expecting one man.
you know, they're just some people I owe money to who wanted to be here.
who are they?
well, they are some Chechen patriots, entrepreneurs.
and the black chaps are some businessmen from Nigeria.
you owe money to the Nigerians and Chechens?
Yes. Yes, I do.
you're a piece of work. Thank you.
probably best to get started.
this is good, baby. We're in the game, we know the score.
the only thing that bugs me is we still don't know who Ershon's targeting.
is it the lotto? Who is it?
who cares? Some rich prick.
I have to tell you, I am tremendously excited by this deal.
and I can assure you that every dime of your money will be invested with the utmost diligence.
your rates of return are really exciting.
we think our members are gonna be just thrilled.
Yeah. I mean, we've averaged, like, 18% over the last 10 years.
all right. Quiet as a church mouse, in and out.
I can feel that tingling in my balls you were talking about.
beautiful.
all right, listen up.
I am Detective Gamble. This is Detective Hoitz.
we need your cooperation.
david Ershon.
you're under arrest for fraud, embezzlement, and in connection to the murder of Don Beaman.
this is a bad idea.
Hey, guys.
Bob? What are you doing here?
I'm investing.
do you remember we talked about that proxy vote a while back?
this is what it was for. Holy shit.
it's a more aggressive investment strategy for the pension.
Allen! We're the suckers. They're targeting the police pension fund.
gentlemen, you're here illegally and without a warrant.
we are within our rights to take action.
so much for quiet as church mice!
go!
who the hell are those guys?
gentlemen, I can get you obstructed view tickets for Rock of Ages.
even I admit that's not very tempting, but I'm not made of tickets, God damn it!
get in the front! How do you start this freaking thing?
go on! Go!
shit! Go!
Oh, my...
Jeanie! Get over here! You, go get the bloody car!
hold the wheel!
open the back! I got it. I got it!
they're gonna kill me. And then they will kill you.
well, I'm gonna kill you first! And then they will kill me.
we have two rogue police officers. They are armed and dangerous, and holding David Ershon hostage. Stupid pricks!
it's us, we're good guys! Exactly. They're the good guys.
where do we go? Where do we go?
I have a small apartment. No one knows about it.
I use it mainly for my parents and prostitutes.
not at the same time. That would be wrong.
let's hear it from the top, every detail.
I think the best way to tell the story is by starting at the end, briefly, then going back to the beginning, and then periodically returning to the end, maybe giving different characters' perspectives throughout.
just to give it a bit of dynamism, otherwise, it's just sort of a linear story.
just tell us what happened.
I lost a bunch of money from some people and now they want it back.
what about Don Beaman?
beaman knew that I had falsified my financials, so they sent down Wesley to try and keep him quiet.
he forced him at gunpoint to drink a bunch of gin and then forced him onto the ledge.
it was only a matter of time before he fell.
at least we stopped you from getting the pension fund.
well, but, yeah, but you didn't. It's already in my account.
by 9: 00 in the morning, it goes into the Lendl equity fund and from there it's transferred to a dozen offshore accounts.
by 9: 01, it's gone.
well, what if we stop the transfer? But you can't.
what if we stop the transfer?
you'd have to be at Endemic Bank for 9: 00 exactly, find the clerk, get the routing number.
we gotta stop it.
there's no way.
every cop, the crazy Australian and his crew, they'll all be after us.
you could let me go, and I'll give you $10 million each.
it's not a bribe. Of course it's a bribe.
you're offering to pay us money to not do our job.
it's not a bribe.
we hang low here tonight. Nobody knows about this place.
we'll be safe. And tomorrow, we hit it.
first things first, I gotta go see Sheila.
no way, it's too dangerous.
look, Terry, we don't know what's gonna happen to us tomorrow, but tonight, I need to make things right with Sheila.
all right, go. Go. Be careful.
Thanks, I will.
will you say hi to Sheila for me?
okay. Okay.
tell her. Say Terry was asking about you.
he wants to make sure you know that he'll be there for you if anything happens.
Yeah. Drop of a hat, I'm there.
look, it's starting to get a little weird, man.
if something happens to you, I need to be there to take care of her.
all of her wants, her needs, and desires are now my responsibility.
why do you say it like it's a predetermined thing?
just go, man.
okay. Thanks.
go.
Janeco Gallery.
Francine, it's Terry. Please don't hang up.
please pick up.
hello.
Hey, sweetie. I was praying you'd be at your mom's house.
you know what, I can't talk anymore. I think the phone's being tapped.
baby, where are you? I wanna see you.
I'm near the place where we did it three Halloweens ago.
do you remember?
okay, yeah, I got it.
I'm just warning you, though.
watch out. I think they're watching the house.
don't worry, sweetie. I think I have a way of talking to you.
I have to admit, I wasn't gonna come. I mean...
after all those years, after the restraining order.
I was worried I might not see you again.
there's some very dangerous people after him, and now they're after us.
it's just the old lady.
Hello, Allen.
Hello, Mama Ramos. What are you doing out here?
Sheila said she doesn't know what happened and she wants you back.
she also says...Yes. She wants you on top of her, holding her hair, and riding her like a bucking bronco while she sucks your thumb and says, "Mommy likey."
you, you tell your daughter...He said he'll always love you.
and he's so happy that you're having his child.
Allen.
he also says that he wants you to stare into each other's eyes without blinking while you do it.
I love when we do that, Mom. And then afterward, lick the sex off each other.
I don't wanna do this.
you say things that are too personal.
okay, but just one more thing.
she said she loves you, and wants to hold your hand and have iced tea with you.
come on. That's not all she said.
no.
she says other things, but I don't want. Please, please, please.
you don't realize, I may be killed tomorrow.
okay.
she says she wants to unplug all the clocks and the phones and have a three-day F marathon. That's more like it. Yeah.
she wants to walk wrong for a week because you guys F'd so hard.
that's just lovely.
no more! He says things I can't say.
it involves a mannequin hand and an electric shaver taped to a golf club.
now what'd she say?
she says she loves you.
I'm so sorry about everything.
and I just had to come here tonight to tell you that I love you.
and the reason why I act like you're a plain wife is that I'm afraid that if I admit to how stunning and intelligent and wonderful you are, I'd just lose you. Shut up, Allen. I love you.
we have a place that's safe. All right.
I'm gonna break your hip.
I'm about to do you grandpa-style.
I brought some music.
not what I would've chosen, but screw it.
all right. Let's go, Monday morning, time to go to work.
let's do it.
you want my gate code? Shut up, man!
that's Wesley!
Yes!
Where'd you learn to drive like that? Grand Theft Auto!
shit, Allen, they're coming.
Oh, my God! Shit.
do something, Allen! Hold on, hold on.
someone's been playing Grand Theft Auto.
I did that!
I did that! Oh, my God!
that's what I'm talking about! We jackknifed them!
did you see that? It went backwards and then turned upside-down.
gator turns vans upside-down like they're in a crazy washing machine!
why are you calling yourself Gator?
it's a nickname I had in college. I used to run a dating service.
he was a pimp. Yeah, I was. I was a pimp.
is it me or does it smell like deer vagina in here?
my poor car.
right now the streets are a bloodbath.
and, statistically speaking, there's about 30 kids in here, 10 of you are gonna be dead before your next birthday.
got a couple of tips, help you guys stay out of jail.
one, try your hardest to not be black or Hispanic.
it's a good tip. Yeah. Two...
gentlemen, we got a hot one.
Hoitz and Gamble have Ershon hostage, high-speed car chase in progress.
Yes! Gun, gun!
pass up the guns. Pass them up. Let's go, people.
there we go. Anything, any Tasers? No?
good. Who wants to go on a ride-along?
I do!
all right, you, sweetie. Come on, let's go. Move.
move! Let's go. Come on!
cool, a helicopter! Must be covering the high-speed chase.
Jesus!
who are those guys? They're Chechen investors.
we were gonna do a Chechen version of Dora the Explorer.
anyway, it went terribly wrong.
I feel like it's not fair that they have a helicopter!
Oh, no.
damn it.
watch your head. God, your hair is soft.
VO5 Hot Oil.
you're gonna wreck! There's cars coming from both directions!
I'm not gonna wreck!
I'm gonna wreck! You're right! You want me to drive?
this was a very clever idea. Yeah.
they're gone.
let's go.
they are Nigerians. Yeah, I'd forgotten about them.
this is a shortcut. Are you kidding me?
you cannot go down there.
what are you doing?
hit him!
where are we? Chelsea Pier.
what the hell?
Jesus!
them having a helicopter is definitely cheating.
go!
come on!
we're cops! Hit the chopper!
this is Martin and Fosse, en route.
back off! This is our collar!
set up a perimeter. No arrests until we get there!
take the light!
do not authorize that transfer.
this is David Ershon. The transfer is for him.
he will tell you not to authorize it, okay? Tell him.
tell him! Yeah, do as they say. Stop the transfer.
approve it.
now.
do not touch anything!
I swear to God I'll blow your head all over this desk.
not a person in this room believes you'll shoot this clerk.
yeah?
thank you so much, gentlemen, for the prompt delivery of Mr. Ershon.
I have two competing bids from jilted investors.
they're at 30 million, and holding.
wait! Can't you let me take him away.
but computers.
what if, one day, they were in charge?
now if you don't shut up, I will cut your ear off with a butter knife.
that's blunt. Blunt's worse than if it's sharp.
now!
you just stood there!
I didn't know that "now" meant that. How am I supposed to know that?
I knew what that meant. Shut up.
you kill us and you kill Ershon. You're out 30 million dollars.
who's got the golden goose now, huh? Yeah.
shit!
he's still valuable with a bullet wound, mate.
he immediately called your bluff.
get up. And kill the police.
I just wanna make sure I get it right.
did you want this transfer approved or not approved?
you, mate, I'm gonna kill just for fun.
police, don't move! Drop your weapons!
drop it, or be dropped, homeboy!
I hope you like the taste of prison food and penis.
police! Down on the ground! Let me see your hands!
Hey, hey, you okay? Hey.
Hey, Gene. Captain. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. That's okay. Don't worry about it.
you can call me Gene when we're not in the office.
okay. Thanks for coming by.
Attaboy.
come on, stay with me. Stay with me.
we're losing him! We're losing him! He's dying!
no. No, no, no, no. I'm just resting.
I'm just resting.
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you? I'm just resting.
are you all right? Just resting.
Hey, let me tell you something.
as far as paperwork goes, we'll take care of it.
you know why? Why?
ain't too proud to beg.
come on.
what? It's not funny anymore.
I don't know what you're talking about. TLC references.
still nothing. I swear to you.
I'm gonna go over and check on Terry.
I got a bad knee. Hold on. There you go.
it was the king of the mutt cases, but Allen and Terry had worked it like stars.
within 24 hours of learning about Ershon's scheme and Lendl's massive losses, the government issued TARP funds to bail out Lendl.
Lendl is in everything, and we're gonna go everywhere...
they were too big to fail.
Ershon now resides in Palomino Federal Correctional Facility in Florida.
he still invests. Currency's just different.
Roger Wesley was linked to the Beaman murder by security cam footage which Martin and Fosse hadn't checked.
it only showed the back of their heads.
but Allen's Faceback app was able to get a match to their faces.
Terry married Francine.
he played harp at the reception and it was beautiful.
he had learned how to play it in the eighth grade to make fun of the fairy that lived up the street.
Terry asked Sheila to be his best man, but she declined.
let's be honest, we all wanna be superstars and hotshots.
but guess what?
the people that do the real work, the ones that make the difference, you don't see them on TV or on the front page.
I'm talking about the day-in, day-outers, the grinders.
come on, man, you know who I'm talking about: The other guys.
see? That's a no-go. Hey, hey.
you think you broke this Ershon case open?
you did nothing.
corporate lobbyists are spending millions to make sure guys like Ershon keep doing what they do.
Derek Jeter?
Yeah, it's me. You were set up that night you shot me, Terry.
I told you! They knew by putting someone like you with a quick trigger finger next to that door where I do my pre-game walk, it'd end up bad. Bad for both of us.
now, I've been doing my own investigation on the banking industry, and I was close. I was real close.
so I forgive you, Terry.
I appreciate that, man. I'm sorry about what happened.
I'm glad you're doing better.
the whole damn system is clogged up with dirty money.
and the news doesn't say a word about it. 'Cause who owns them?
the same corporations that own the government.
courts and the law is all we have left.
so here's you guys' next case.
guy by the name of Carl Bachand, CEO of Killister Bank.
he took three billion in TARP funds.
he's crooked. He's real crooked.
take him down, but be careful. He's got Blackwater mercenaries 24l7.
Thanks, Derek.
Hey, Derek! Wait! What if we need to get in touch with you, get some more information or some tickets or something?
what just happened?
POWEREDY BY 100% VEGETABLE OIL
goldman Sachs. This case is gonna be nasty.
Hi. Cute glasses.
what was that? What?
what? Dude, what is it with you and hot ladies? What's your secret?
honestly, I have no idea what you're talking about.
tell me who you lost your virginity to.
she actually became a TV actress. Heather Locklear.
Heather Locklear, what?
you've heard of her? Come on!
she was much chubbier back then.
I don't get it. I really, I don't get it.
that was you. You don't have a sense of humor.
I do... I have a wonderful sense of humor.
if you say something funny, I'll laugh.
all right, I'm gonna tell you a great joke.
please. I love jokes.
all right. Little boy on his 13th birthday.
it's time to get laid. Already feels inappropriate.
so he goes to the lady at the whorehouse, he goes, " Miss, look, I know usually you want money, but I don't have any money and it's my birthday."
do you think I could have sex with you for this duck?
was he a farmer? No.
that's probably a Health Code violation, bringing a duck into a place of prostitution.
they weren't gonna have sex with the duck!
no, I just mean Health Code violation to have the duck brought into a facility like that.
so, anyway, she says, "Yes, I'll do it."
so he goes in there, gives it to her.
he gives her what?
the high, hard one! She loves it.
she goes,"You know what?"
if you do that again, I'll give you your duck back.
it's like getting laid twice for free. So... I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
the duck is payment for sexual intercourse. Yes. Yes.
very good. He used the duck as payment, and now he's being paid back the duck.
he goes," Oh, my God, this is the greatest birthday ever."
he does it again.
now he's walking home, right? Walking...
so she was satisfied with duck.
with a duck as currency. Yes.
to her. Great. Good.
so he's walking home, now he can't wait to get home to tell his father. Right?
he's walking down the street with the duck, and all of a sudden, voom, truck comes by and runs over his duck.
kills the duck? Killed the duck.
so the duck is now dead. The duck is dead.
the kid starts crying, truck driver stops, he's all upset, he didn't mean. Of course he's crying!
he's a 13-year-old boy who's just had sex, twice, and he watched his beloved duck die.
will you shut up and let me tell the story?
so far, I don't know how this is ever gonna be funny.
the guy feels so bad about killing the duck, he gives him two dollars.
and the kid's happy with the two bucks?
he's ecstatic! He got laid twice, and now he's got two dollars on top of it.
seems like a duck would be worth a lot more than two dollars.
this was a while back. You what I'm...
so he goes home, his dad goes, "What happened? What happened?"
tell me! Tell me!
he goes, "Dad, I got a fuck for the duck, I got a duck for the fuck, and I got two bucks for a fucked-up duck!"
so it's like a limerick.
you didn't think that was funny?
I thought it was entertaining at the end, sure, the way all the words were put together, but in terms of content?
no.
get the check-check from Shen-Shen. Let's get out of here.
stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
and cut.
my name is Oliver Queen.
for 5 years, I was stranded on an island with only one goal... survive.
Oliver Queen is alive.
now I will fulfill my father's dying wish...
to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city.
to do this, I must become someone else.
I must become something else.
I'd like you to work with me on the Vigilante investigation.
thank you, sir!
it's just beginning. In six months, the organization's vision of what this city should be will be complete.
thousands of innocent people will be dead and you'll feel nothing.
that's not true.
I'll feel a sense of accomplishment.
so... How can we be of assistance?
Malcolm Merlyn. I want you to kill him for me.
these black arrows aren't consistent with his M. O.
something doesn't add up.
what do you mean, the chopper's about to touch down?
the flight log doesn't have them due for another 20 minutes!
then lock down the heliport!
I've just landed in Starling City.
we agreed... half on arrival, the other half when the job is done.
a
gracias. Don't worry. The man's as good as...
you have failed this city.
you've built quite a reputation.
and you should have stayed overseas.
I thought about it, but then I remembered... I've got a reputation, too.
now the trick is to keep your weight evenly distributed.
I thought the trick was to avoid getting into fights.
besides, if you're going to be working with us,
I'll sleep a lot easier knowing that you can handle yourself... At least a little bit.
how'd it go?
badly for him. - Who's him?
an assassin for hire with an affinity for knives.
his name was Guillermo Barrera. - Was?
so we can't ask him about his intended target?
no.
which is why I need you to hack his phone.
Barrera's world class.
he kills high profile targets.
and whatever job he was hired for isn't finished.
we need to figure out who he was here to kill, and fast.
they are probably still in danger.
OK? - Yeah.
I have to meet McKenna.
good thing she didn't meet you at the heliport.
may not be a good idea to fall for the cop that's hunting you down.
well, it's slim pickings for us vigilantes.
four.
well, I'm more of a runner.
why the sudden desire to work out?
what else is there to do?
well, we can try to think of another way off the island.
there is no other way.
if there was, I would have found it.
we can't just sit here and wait for Fyers to come and kill us.
I did have one idea.
if you go into the forest and gather as much bamboo as you can find...
yeah?
we could build ourselves a boat, like they did on "Gilligan's Island.
that's broken.
it got busted during the crash.
did you try to get it to work?
I'm better at pulling things apart.
my father was a pilot and he used to do his own maintenance.
so you're hoping aircraft maintenance is genetic?
no, I used to help him and I liked it.
then I got pretty good at it.
so maybe I can make the radio work.
you should be training for the inevitable fight that's looming.
I think I have a better chance of making the radio work.
sorry I'm late.
no, I am. I just got caught up at the office.
me, too.
you look nice.
we should go inside.
we should.
we don't seem to be going inside.
welcome.
happy Birthday, buddy. - Thank you.
Oh, this feels like a Chateauneuf de Pape.
it's going to taste like one, too.
you are a true friend. Thank you.
Tommy, you remember McKenna Hall.
from back in the day. - And back again.
Laurel, this is... - McKenna Hall.
we know each other from the court house.
how are you, counselor?
I'm well, Detective.
I'm going to go crack this open. - Come in.
such a nice apartment. So much space.
Oh, this is adorable.
how old are you here?
that's actually my sister Sarah.
Oh, I am so sorry.
no, no, it's ok.
I don't know why my father bought her that canary.
that thing chirped night and day. Drove us all nuts.
a toast.
to the first birthday that I have enjoyed in a long time.
I got my best friend back.
and... I have finally figured out why poets have been in business for the last few thousand years.
happy Birthday, baby. - Thank you.
Cheers. Cheers.
I think that's the food. - Oh, ok.
Oh, thank God, she didn't cook.
Amen.
Mr. Merlyn.
Laurel. Can I come in?
Mr. Merlyn.
I've been trying to get in touch with you.
what are you doing here, Dad?
happy Birthday, Tommy.
just give us a second.
of course.
we're about to eat. - I can't stay.
well, that works out because you weren't invited.
I'm being honored by the Starling City Municipal Group.
they're bestowing me with their annual Humanitarian Award.
what, they ran out of actual humans to give it to?
I would like you to be there, if you could.
I am 100% certain that I'll be busy.
you might not believe this, but all I ever wanted for you was happiness.
if it will allay this tension between us, I'll turn the switch back on.
save your money, Dad.
I don't need it anymore.
I'd still like you to come to the event.
it would mean a lot to me.
you know what, Dad?
sometimes the people that you want there the most... Aren't.
you taught me that.
multiple times.
Hello, Lawton.
I see your edge has dulled.
Oh, I knew you were there.
I just didn't care if you killed me.
what do you want?
my organization has been contracted to eliminate a certain high profile individual.
a very well-guarded target.
well, forget it.
look, I'm retired.
to drink and smoke your life away?
we all got to die some time.
I need someone to die at the right time.
and no one does it better than you.
my vision... ain't exactly what it used to be.
no.
it's going to be better.
so... Who needs two bullets in the chest?
is it happening?
Yes.
the Humanitarian Award ceremony.
isn't that a little public?
no one will expect it.
I have very welcome news to share with all of you.
thanks to Queen Consolidated's Applied Sciences Division and their recent acquisition of Unidac Industries, the Undertaking which we set for ourselves is only months from fruition.
there's hope on the horizon for everyone in starling.
we won't fail this city.
and I think I speak for everyone here when I say we're all with you, Malcolm.
jeez, this is one paranoid assassin.
Barerra's got cobalt-level encryption on his phone.
it's not going to be easy to break.
but codebreaker is my middle name. Actually, it's Megan...
Felicity, can you get anything off of it?
just the last number he dialed.
which was? - A restaurant in China town.
a Jade Dragon. I guess even hired killers enjoy the city's best chow mien.
Yeah, Jade Dragon is a front for the Chinese mafia.
call the restaurant, make a reservation for two for tonight.
you need to decrypt that phone.
I'm kind of in the mood for Chinese now.
that is...that is one big fried fish.
I was told this was the most authentic Szechwan in town.
whatever. I wanted to make sure that your birthday celebration got its due celebration.
it was a little bit, um, tense last night.
well, trust my dad to run all the smiles out of the room.
he did come by, and it seemed like he was trying to act a little bit dad-like.
Dad-like, that sums up my father perfectly.
I know the two of you have never been close, but it couldn't have been easy for him after your mom was killed.
Yeah, I guess he forgot that there were two of us in that club.
I'm not defending him, Tommy.
it's... With everything I've been through, people that I've lost...
I know how hard it can be.
you probably don't remember this.
we were eight.
but after her funeral, he left for like two years.
and when he did come back, he was... he was so frickin' cold.
we barely spoke.
and that's why I spent so much time at your house.
from the outside, it always looked like I had a father.
he paid my bills, he lived in the house, he bailed me out.
but your dad took me to my first hockey game.
your dad taught me how to fly fish.
your dad took us to our first R-rated movie.
but he wasn't perfect.
my dad made mistakes.
and... We haven't talked about this.
but I have a lot of anger towards him.
but still, I would give anything to have him back, because...
at the end of the day, your dad is... Your dad.
I meant what I said last night.
I'm... really glad that you're back.
I got to hit the restroom.
b c d e f g h i j k l
check, please.
I hope you like barbecue.
well, don't fall over yourself thanking me for spending six hours up a tree so you can eat.
what?
great. I'll eat later.
you've been on that for days. Give it a rest.
it's because I can do this.
sure, kid. When pigs fly.
you're kidding me.
can you clean this up?
I don't know. I don't know how I got this far!
continue approach. Big jet 365.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
this is wedgetail 325.
pilot and passenger down.
runway 2-7 right, wind, 2-7-0 degrees, 10 knots.
I repeat...pilot and passenger down on the island of Lian Yu.
request immediate rescue.
cleared to land, runway 2-7 right.
big jet 365.
they can't hear us, and we can't call out.
we're still trapped.
the Triad have hired a contract killer.
yeah? You mean the one you put in the morgue?
congratulations, you're the talk of the station again.
they hired one, they're going to hire another, Detective.
who's your target?
I'm trying to find out but I'm hitting dead ends.
I need you to put your people on it.
my people don't work for you.
and come to think of it, neither do I.
it's not about you and me, Detective.
it's about saving a life.
call me back when you got a name.
Yes, sir?
you and me. We're going to catch that Vigilante.
there are five exit routes from the main floor that need to be cut off.
once the fire alarm goes off, we'll have less than 30 seconds to disable Merlyn's private security and force him outside with the others.
once he's outside... The rest will be up to Mr. Lawton.
Roger that.
m
you look handsome!
I try not to. It just keeps happening.
what's the occasion?
I decided to go to my dad's thing.
Really?
are you sure?
Oh, mostly.
did you want me to go with you?
no, no, no, I know you have work to do.
I promise I will be fine.
n o
you look beautiful.
thank you.
if you're free, maybe after the ceremony, we could have dinner and talk like we used to.
I'd like that.
that's my cue.
I've been trying to avoid him all evening.
if we didn't show, it'd look suspicious.
how can you talk to him that way?
as if nothing's about to happen?
I've been living this life for five years.
five more minutes won't matter.
good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
now tonight's honoree needs very little introduction.
it's neither his wealth nor his name that we celebrate here tonight.
but it is his efforts in making Starling City a better and safer place to live.
so please help me welcome Starling City's humanitarian of the year, Mr. Malcolm Merlyn.
and so that's a stage, right.
most nights we'll have a band.
somebody cool. Is Fallout Boy still cool?
they broke up.
and never.
so somebody else will pick the bands.
something bothering you?
don't say no,'cause you're a terrible liar.
Really?
I thought I was getting better at it.
what's wrong?
there's a lot of stuff going on in my life.
work.
friends.
and I'm having a... difficult time figuring out how to fit it all in.
I've been struggling with some of those thoughts, as well.
do you have any good ideas?
I think we just have to be really honest about what's going on in our lives.
think you can do that?
come on.
I'm in! Yes!
Yes! Yes, way to go, Felicity Smoak.
you don't happen to speak Spanish, do you?
Arabic.
Oh, le sigh.
Oh, my God.
you know I'm there for you.
excuse me, Mr. Queen.
the I. T. department has that item that you requested.
one sec. - Ok.
you find the target?
Oliver, the target is Tommy's father.
at the awards ceremony?
Tommy's there.
um, McKenna, Mr. Diggle is going to take you home.
I have some unexpected business.
it's ok.
target is Malcolm Merlyn.
establish a perimeter but keep your distance.
I don't want the police caught in the crossfire.
the true humanitarian in the Merlyn family was my wife Rebecca.
many of you here knew her.
she tirelessly devoted herself to helping those less fortunate in the glades.
I like to think that if the men who murdered her knew her;
knew the work that she did, knew the person that she was...
he would have helped her to her car, made sure she was safe, instead of stealing her purse and shooting her.
the truth is, I haven't done enough for this city.
my city.
I failed it.
but I promise you... I am not finished yet.
I promise you that this city will be better for all of us.
and on that day, I will look at this beautiful award and feel that I have earned it.
I thank you.
Merlyn's not taking the bait. Change of plans.
I don't like improvisation.
drive him upstairs to his penthouse office.
I need to switch vantage points.
come with me.
there's an exit on the second floor.
I wasn't leaving until I knew you were safe.
go somewhere safe. I'll hold them off.
go now! - Come on!
where are we going? - Up.
who are those guys? - I don't know.
they're trying to kill you!
seems that way.
and we're going up, without any of your bodyguards?
dad! We need to get out of here.
Tommy, take a deep breath and trust me.
upstairs in my office is a panic room.
we get there, we seal it off.
Merlyn's headed to the penthouse.
why do you want Malcolm Merlyn dead?
I'll settle for you.
wait!
go! - You killed him!
surely as he would have killed you.
move, move, move!
electromagnetic locks.
what if they cut the power?
this floor is on an entire separate grid.
the glass?
lexan. Bulletproof. It's over.
how did you know how to do that?
what?
fight.
kill.
dad?
Freeze! SCPD.
put the bow down.
Tommy, you ok?
dad!
dad?!
turn around slowly.
dad.
I'm sorry.
I'm ok.
I'm ok.
damn it.
you're bleeding. You're bleeding.
I'll be fine, Tom.
no, no, no, Dad!
No!
stay back.
I'm not here to hurt you or your father.
I said stay back.
curare.
don't come any closer.
your father's been poisoned.
an assassin named Floyd Lawton laces his bullets with curare.
I've dealt with this before.
we need to dilute the poison in his bloodstream.
I said stay the hell back!
in three minutes he's paralyzed.
in four minutes, he suffocates.
if you don't let me help you now, he's dead before anybody gets here!
help. How?
fresh blood buys him time to get to the hospital.
a blood transfusion?
that's insane!
it's the only way.
he needs your blood.
you're out of time.
you need to make a decision right now.
why should I trust you?!
because you always have.
OK. Ready?
do it.
hold his arm.
come on, come on, come on.
you're the Vigilante.
Why?
later.
he's still going to need medical attention to fully clean out his system, you understand?
OK.
thank you.
I'm right here, Dad.
what did the Hood say to you?
he didn't say anything.
you let a homicidal maniac talk you into a homemade blood transfusion instead of calling the paramedics?
my father's life was at stake.
so first the Hood rescues you and Queen from those kidnappers, now he saves your old man.
but he's taking down every other one percenter out there.
is this guy a friend of yours, Merlyn?
I don't know who the hell he is.
if they can't hear us, then what's the point?
wait!
you still might have done us some good.
0500 hours from my mark.
final deployment is five by five.
that's Fyers!
I'm tuned into the soldier's frequency.
Scylla is in route. ETA 0600 hours.
at the southwest bay.
I'll call you when Scylla is in my possession.
Fyers out.
who was Fyers talking to?
I don't know.
sounds like someone off this island, maybe his benefactor.
more importantly, who or what is Scylla?
the Scylla and Charibdis.
it's "The Odyssey," from one of the four nightmare chapters.
Scylla was a monster.
I want to meet this monster.
am I going alone?
so how's it feel to save a one percenter?
looks like Malcolm Meryln's going to be ok.
they took him to Starling General.
good thing he was wearing a bulletproof vest.
he's not in the hospital because he was shot.
he was poisoned by curare.
Lawton's alive.
I'm sorry, John.
this Lawton kick his dog or something?
no.
he killed his brother.
what?
what is it?
you were right.
Scylla is a monster.
a Russian-made S300 anti-aircraft missile launcher.
it can simultaneously track up to a hundred targets while engaging with at least a dozen.
I mean, from here, they could shoot down a commercial airliner, or start a war.
Hey, you're here.
walk with me.
I heard you were there, are you ok?
I'm fine. Fine.
listen, McKenna, I'm... I'm really sorry that I had to run out on you like that.
don't worry. Five more minutes, and I would have had to run out on you.
our lives are complicated.
but I'm willing to figure us out.
if you are.
willing and able.
Hey. Hey, Dad.
take it easy.
you were shot.
the bullet was laced with poison.
I should be dead.
I gave you a blood transfusion.
actually it was... the Vigilante's idea.
he saved you.
he did?
I was worried I was going to lose you.
I'm not going anywhere.
you said that after mom died.
but you left.
I wasn't a very good father to you after your mother passed away.
I was so lost.
you never told me where you went.
I found myself in a place called Nanda Parbat.
I met a man there.
he helped me make sense of things.
he helped me to find a purpose for my life;
to make this city a better place for everyone.
especially for you.
how are you going to do that?
could I talk to Moira for a minute?
thank God you're all right.
we have a traitor in our midst.
I want you to find out who.
he just made his last mistake.
my dad's going to be ok, thanks to you.
it's thanks to you.
no one's asked you what happened to you out on that island.
you said "a lot." That doesn't quite cover it. - Tommy...
I saw you kill those guys who kidnapped us when you first got back, didn't I?
I... I know you have a lot of questions.
Yeah.
Yeah, but for now, just the one.
were you ever going to tell me?
no.
Tommy, I just saw it all on the news.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Bye.
Hello, Laurel.
mom?
what are you doing here?
I need to talk to you.
about what?
I know I've made mistakes.
Yeah.
Yes, you have.
look, I have to go.
why don't you send me an email or a postcard some time?
I have something important I need to discuss with you.
what could be so important after all this time?
it's about Sarah.
what about her?
I think she may be alive.
my name is Oliver Queen.
for 5 years, I was stranded on an island with only one goal... survive.
Oliver Queen is alive.
now I will fulfill my father's dying wish...
to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city.
to do this, I must become someone else.
I must become something else.
mom? - What are you doing here?
I believe Sarah's still alive.
you don't actually have any proof.
I have proof. Doesn't it look just like Sarah?
I did manage to find one thing.
I want to get out.
Malcolm Merlyn. I want you to kill him for me.
we have a traitor in our midst.
he just made his last mistake.
lawyers for John Nickels spoke to the press today.
John Nickel is one of the wealthiest real estate developers in Starling City.
he's also one of the dirtiest.
that building that burnt down last night?
wiring was not up to code. - Maybe he didn't know that.
Yeah, he's a real man of the people.
not for long.
the D. A. ignores this, and the police can't do anything because all these slums are in the Glades. So tonight, Felicity, we cross Mr. Nickel's name off the list.
you ok with that?
100 percent.
he was just gone?
No! Not gone. Taken.
looks like Nickel was on somebody else's list, too.
after the fire last night, it's not entirely surprising.
Felicity, I need you to get me everything that you can on Nickel.
focus on his tenants, and anyone who might have filed a formal complaint against him, or...
people that lost something in the fire.
well, it's going to be some list. I mean, slum lords aren't generally known for their popularity. Plus...
what?
nothing, it's just... you went over there to be all, "grrr, stop being bad or I'll arrow you,
and now you want to rescue him.
I don't like the idea that somebody dangerous is out there.
somebody else.
because typically... They don't show my level of restraint.
so you're going to cross Nickel off anyway?
no.
I'm finding somebody else who needs a talking to.
you're going out there again, Oliver?
why don't you go home and be with your family, man?
that's when the work is done, Diggle.
OK, then I'll take you out to dinner.
I'm not hungry.
I'm not asking.
simple exchange.
you get us a way off the island, and we'll give you the circuit board so that your missile launcher isn't just furniture.
I can get you a boat.
but I need time.
you got an hour, Fyers, and then you're never... what?!
we understand it might take you longer than an hour to get a boat.
what we mean is you need to move with some dispatch.
Ah, Wilson, still in command there, eh?
I thought your little pet had staged a coup d'etat.
just get us the damn boat.
now you want to stop?
well, we don't all have butlers.
you know, some of us actually have to answer our own doors.
Oh, the horror.
you look familiar.
did I see you on TV or something?
probably. I'm Thea Queen.
Yeah, right.
did you get it?
tomorrow night.
Joe wants us there at 11 p. m.
he said to be on time, Harper.
what's happening tomorrow at 11: 00?
you know, I'm actually kind of focused on what's happening right now.
Oh, ok. Yeah.
no, no, Thea, don't!
why do you have a gun?
because I'm no good with knives.
look, it's just a liquor store.
the guy's a creep. Trust me, he deserves it.
look, if it'll make you feel any better... I won't be armed.
but of course, the owner won't know that, but...
I got you a job at my brother's club. You have choices. You don't have to be a criminal!
I'm not talking about phone bills.
I owe people.
people with much bigger guns than this.
look, here in the Glades, this is pretty much the only solution.
no, lots of people in the Glades live honest lives.
obviously not you.
you're just a waste.
no, Thea. Thea!
I'm going to make sure you get home ok.
don't bother.
Hey, honey.
there you go.
um, what's all this?
well, you asked me to look into your mother's leads on Sarah, so I made some calls.
it looks like you did a lot more than that.
well, yeah, but you're the one who said we should do this, Laurel, so, you know, if there's even a chance that your sister is...
Yeah, but... - thank you.
Hi, sweetheart, I'm sorry about the mess.
Quentin, I just got off the phone with the consulate in Phuket.
the secretary there's going to run Sarah's photo against their database, see if there's a match.
that's good work.
what?
well, I guess I just thought deep down that you were going to help mom... accept things.
things you and I accepted.
Yeah, but... You got to admit.
this girl, she looks a lot like Sarah.
Sarah had that same cap. The Starling City Rockets.
your dad bought it for her, remember?
Yeah, I remember.
stranger things have happened.
Yeah. I can see that.
hungrier than I thought.
are you waiting for me to finish before giving me the lecture?
Oliver, you've been spending a lot of time under that hood the last couple weeks.
keeps my ears warm.
and you made this decision to, um, avoid entanglements?
for their protection.
the people who get close to me get hurt.
what's the problem?
do you think I'm losing my grip?
no, it's just the opposite, really. You seem calm.
scary calm.
I get that things didn't end well with Helena, with McKenna...
with Laurel. With Sarah.
the list goes on. - Yeah. But what do you do?
you hood up, you go home, you repeat. It's not much of a life.
well, the life that I'm leading for myself right now doesn't leave much room for an actual life.
and I don't need one.
that's a pretty bleak future you plan on spending...with no one.
I'm used to isolation.
and that is exactly what worries me.
you've been home for 8 months, Oliver, but I don't think you left that island yet.
what the hell is going on?
found Nickel. Click the link I just sent you.
this came up on every screen with an I. P. address originating from the Glades.
if you make the Glades your home, you know who this man is.
he owns your tenements.
manages your slums.
provides the leaking roofs over your head.
the mold in your pipes and asbestos in your walls.
basically, he makes money off our suffering.
but the police aren't interested in helping us.
they may have let us down, but I won't.
John, I want to give you the chance to state your case.
why shouldn't you be punished?
I knew there was bad stuff in my buildings.
track him, Felicity. - I'm looking.
OK, yes, I made a little profit!
at least they had a place to live.
without me, people like that would end up on the street.
people like that.
that's all we are to guys like this.
I find you... Guilty.
there are plenty more people who need to answer for their crimes against us.
so... Who's next?
anything new?
this guy's definitely got more than a subscription to "Wired.
his website's protected by some very serious encryption.
well, use that air magnet thing, you said that it could trace...
Oliver! No offense. Do I tell you how to sharpen your arrows?
spoke to my friend at the NSA.
the website code matches a cyber crusader who's been on their radar.
he hacks into fringe sites under the user name "The Savior.
NSA believes he's a former resident of the Glades.
former? - Yeah, well, a year ago, he hacked himself right off the radar.
he erased all traces of his existence.
so what happened a year ago?
we're back.
I have with me assistant district attorney Gavin Carnahan.
now, DAs are supposed to go after bad guys.
but this one can't even be bothered to bring them to trial.
like the ones who killed my wife in a bodega.
Felicity... - I'm on it.
they said there wasn't enough evidence.
you think the evidence would have turned up if she'd been killed in one of Starling City's nicer neighborhoods?
Emma Falk. Grieving husband is Joseph Falk. What do we have on him?
not much. 42, former city worker.
department of transportation, computer technician, left his job when she was killed. One year ago today.
no current phone, no current address.
Gavin, you're a lawyer. You're used to making a case.
so go ahead.
I'm going to give you ten minutes to deliver the closing argument of your life.
come on. - I'm trying to get a lock on his wireless signal.
10 minutes to convince me not to blow you away.
what did Malcolm want with you last night?
a target for reprisal.
he wants justice, and he's not going to stop until he gets it.
besides, this is good.
I think your definition of good requires an adjustment.
no, he came to me. Which means he doesn't know that we're responsible for the attempt on his life.
yet.
what are the chances of Malcolm discovering who paid the triad to assassinate him?
I was very discreet.
I wired the money through a shell corporation I own, from an offshore account.
offshore? Good. That's good.
I'm sending Amanda to London for a few weeks, just as a precaution.
perhaps you should do the same for your family.
there's nothing I wouldn't do to protect my children, Frank.
Hey, can I talk to you about something?
almost woman to woman.
I'm really busy right now.
OK.
sorry.
what's up?
I could use some advice.
I'm sort of dating this guy who would definitely be described as a bad boy.
and I figured, as someone who's dated like a gajillion of them...
I haven't dated a gajillion.
all right, guilty as charged.
you want my advice? Run.
as fast as you possibly can.
Yeah. See, that was my first instinct, too, but...
Laurel? The Chinese embassy's on line two.
I'm transferring him over.
chinese embassy?
it's just this case that I'm working on.
but we are definitely continuing this conversation later.
thank you so much for getting back to me.
I'm trying to track down a woman in the photo that I emailed you.
you did.
Really?
and you're sure that she's in the states now?
do you happen to have an address on her?
I got him! - Shut it down.
can't. He has a firewall protecting his wireless signal.
but he's working off an IPX located at 23rd and Mira.
you want to hood up? - The middle of the day!
look! Listen. Listen to me. Ok.
I have 53 cases on my desk right now.
I don't always have time to take on every case!
how's Carnahan?
not making a very persuasive argument.
I'm almost there.
see anything? - I'm only on the first floor.
just six more to go.
there aren't resources. I tried.
Oh, my God! I'm sorry! - Oliver, hurry.
can't find him!
he's not here, Felicity! - What?!
I searched every office on every floor!
he's not here. Is this the right place?
are you sure? - Yeah, I...
Oh, crap. - What?
how is this possible?! This can't happen! He's...
talk to me! - Wait.
he moved. Just north of you. Ocean and Grand.
on my way!
I took on cases that were...that I thought that I could...
win. - Yes.
I'm sorry.
Gavin Carnahan, I find you guilty of crimes against the Glades.
don't do this! Don't do this!
and I sentence you to death.
I'm at Ocean and Grand, Felicity. That's just a vacant lot.
how is this possible? This can't happen. He...
find the right address, now!
Oliver, it's over, Carnahan is dead.
Where's Diggle?
I asked him to leave me alone.
in my loud voice.
this wasn't your fault.
I was the one who was supposed to find Carnahan, and I was the one who sent you that bogus location.
I've never seen anybody die.
this is the thing with what we do.
sometimes we lose.
maybe it is better being alone.
I'm not seeing anyone currently, but...
if I were, I don't know how I'd tell him about today.
gentlemen. Welcome.
so happy we were able to reach an accord.
Oh, good. Small talk.
are we going to get on with this?
as you wish. Straight to business.
the circuit board. Where is it?
somewhere safe.
so get us to the boat and then we'll tell you where it is.
and of course you'll be honest about its location.
well, I wouldn't be.
but this one's got some strange hang up about principles and integrity.
I always imagined as much.
which is why I'd like to make a counter proposal.
men!
No!
No!
you will deliver back to me the circuit board, or I will kill Yao Fei's daughter.
so I wouldn't leave.
I can't imagine you want the death of an innocent young woman on your hands.
not with your... Principles.
I wanted to do some research on my own into the evidence that you gathered on Sarah.
so I called my friend from law school who works at the Chinese embassy, and...
the photo of the girl.
I found her.
I'm sorry. Can I... can I borrow your phone?
I promised my fianée that I'd call him before dinner. My phone's dead.
Jen, these are my parents.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Yeah, you, too.
I just told Jen about this photograph that popped up in this case that I'm working on.
is that you in the picture?
Yeah. I spent six months on an island off the coast of China.
that was taken in a small fishing village called Zhengjiu.
it's Mandarin for... - Salvation.
are you all right, Mrs. Lance?
Yes, I... it's just, uh, you look like someone I used to know.
I was waiting for this.
waiting for what?
the whole "You can change, I can see the real you" speech.
look around, Thea.
this is home sweet home for me.
you either starve or you do things that mean you're lucky enough to make it to 21.
I can't accept that.
no. You can't accept me.
Roy Harper?
more on the story out of the Glades.
the kidnapper seems to have another victim and is broadcasting the feed to his website.
a warning to viewers, this is live footage, so we're not sure what we're about to see.
meet Roy Harper.
arrests for larceny and robbery, aggravated assault.
and yet you're out on the street.
another gangbanger in the Glades running free, like the ones who killed my wife.
I'm grew up in the Glades, too.
and it didn't turn me into a criminal.
I know that kid.
how? - Tommy!
Oh, God, no.
I didn't know where else to go.
you know him? - Roy, he's my friend.
and we were in a fight and some guy came out of nowhere and just attacked us!
he doesn't deserve to die!
I promise you, he's going to be ok.
you stay here with Tommy, all right?
Hello? - Moira, it's Malcolm.
I've learned a high ranking member of the Triad was just arrested.
well, I should have a word with him.
I already have. He's agreed to find out who hired his organization to assassinate me in return for a reduced prison sentence.
by tonight, we should know the name, or names, of the people who tried to kill me.
good.
what are you doing?
so it's not Sarah in the photo.
but she's still out there, Quentin.
and I'm going to find her.
look, I understand now that neither of you have the stomach to continue looking for her.
and that's fine.
I'm sorry I involved you both.
you know that I would cross to hell and back to bring her home, but I can't!
cause she's gone, Di.
no.
you got to let go of this now.
No! I can't!
I won't!
how did you know Sarah had her hat with her when she went on the boat?
you were so sure that the girl in the photo was Sarah.
not because she was American, but because of her hat.
her Starling City Rockets hat that dad bought her.
mom.
how did you know she took her hat with her on "the Queen's Gambit" with Oliver?
I saw her.
what do you mean?
I came home early that day, and I saw her.
I saw her put the hat in a bag.
she was packing.
you knew she was going with him?
I told her not to... I told her not to do this, not to you, Laurel.
but she said she was in love and she had to follow her heart, even if nobody else thought it was right.
just like I told her... Just like I told her I once did.
so... I let her go.
I killed her.
I... I killed my daughter.
I killed her.
I'm so sorry, Quentin.
I'm so sorry, Quentin.
I killed our baby.
anything?
I've been going through all the video we got, trying to see if there's anything that'll tell us where this guy is.
I got nothing, except a sound.
buried in the ambient noise. Almost rhythmic.
here, I've isolated it.
what is that?
sounds like a car driving over lane markers.
it's bigger than a car.
bigger than a car. What, a bus? - Uh... wait, I know this.
I know it.
come on! Guys!
Felicity, show me a map. Sights of the abductions on where we've seen the signal so far.
right there, right there.
23rd and Mira.
Locksley and Adams.
wells street down by CNRI.
those are all subway stops! - Starling City doesn't have a subway.
no, but they used to. When I was a kid, my dad used to take me down to the Rockets game.
by subway. For 14 minutes, I'd lean against the window, feeling the rhythm of the train moving.
that's how he did it.
he was at 23rd and Mira, but he was underground.
he used to work for the department of transportation, so that's why he knows all the old subway stops.
that's why I couldn't trace the signal.
he was moving. He was in a subway car.
where is he now?
he's on the old cross town line.
if he continues on this route, he'll be at the Spring Street stop in 15 minutes.
let the girl go.
