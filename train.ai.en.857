that clamp's coming up. Can you adjust it?
scissors.
can you reach it, pops?
Dr. Thomas? Dr. Thomas?
Dr. Thomas. I need another clamp.
move! Move! Move! Someone get to him.
what's going on?
I don't have a pulse.
get a crash cart.
right away. Grab his clamp.
damn it. I need a better angle.
switching sides.
let's get an i. v. Set up.
get gowned and gloved.
vitals now. - What's happening?
give me the paddles.
are the paddles on?- Charging. He's in v-fib.
shock him. Charge to 200.
we're on it. Clear.
nothing.
what the - He collapsed in the middle of surgery.
we already shocked him once.
charge to 300. - Charging.
why is this surgery even happening?
don't worry about that right now.
clear!
nothing. Go again. - Charging.
is there a pulse?
clear.
Parker, is there a pulse?!
someone tell me what's going on.
starting c. p. r. Deal with your patient, Cristina.
don't hold your breath.
you stop thinking when you stop breathing.
breathe. Please, god. Breathe.
Oh, god.
please don't tell me that she's - She's okay.
katy has a strong heart.
she should have a long life ahead of her, a long, long life.
thank you.
Oh, my gosh.
thank you.
she's okay.
breathe, Dr. Yang.
don't be crass.
you're skulking.
women of your generation are graceless.
it's an affront to nature.
mediocre surgeons will see you and feel themselves wilting in your shadow.
do not shrink to console them.
do not look for friends here.
you won't find them.
none of these people have the capacity to understand you.
they never will.
if you're lucky, one day when you're old and shriveled like me, you will find a young doctor with little regard for anything but their craft.
and you'll train them like I trained you.
until then, read a good book.
you have greatness in you, yang.
don't disappoint.
Oh, my god. Where is she? Where is she?
there she is.
there's your mama.
Kepner had to scrub in on a colectomy so I took her, right?
you look like you're feeling much better.
well, we read "goodnight moon" ... A couple times, didn't we?
and then you tried to show me how to play patty-cake, right?
and it turns out, uncle Owen is pretty terrible at that.
Oh, and her fever broke a couple hours ago, uh, 99. 2 last time I checked. Yeah.
Dr. Grey. Dr. Grey. - Is she crashing?
Melissa's asking for you.
go, go. I don't need to be anywhere.
okay. Bye, zozo. - Say bye. Say bye.
Hey, you, what we gonna do?
we're gonna do high fives.
patty-cake.
meet Dr. Grey.
I- I-I d- Don't know how much, uh, you remember.
I was-I was trapped, uh... Under something.
and you were there.
you were there, right?
I was. I... I...
thank you. - Thank you, doctor.
what's this?
my list of tucker-tested babysitters.
you need a deeper bench, Dr. Grey.
you're an attending now, you never know when a crisis is gonna happen, and this is gold.
I don't give it out to just anyone.
thank you.
don't wake up. Please don't wake up.
good girl.
Oh, god. No!
not tonight.
not one more thing.
I downed the tequila bottle from my diaper bag.
I can barely... I don't even know what my name is.
Lexie's dead.
Yeah.
everyone's dead.
now Mr. Linzer hates the food, so he will tell you he feels fine.
he does not feel fine.
and if you release him before his i. n. r. Stabilizes, he will bleed to death.
Murphy's gonna keep an eye on him.
I am gonna keep an eye on him.
Mrs. Gellman's still intubated, but I want the tube out by Monday.
have the nurses page you as soon as she starts breathing on her
I - I will ask them myself.
Oh, it's not too much for you? - Not at all.
and yet, you're trying to fob it off to petunia here, with her years and years of experience in critical care.
I want you to relax on your honeymoon.
I thought that you'd be reassured by having two sets of eyes on your patients.
the notion of an intern handling my patients is the best way I can think of to ruin a perfectly good mal tal.
Oh, are you going someplace warm?
we don't have to talk about it.
Oh, no. I want to talk to you about my honeymoon - the hotel, the sights...
I'm gonna handle Mrs. Gellman myself.
what I'm wearing on the plane, what I'm wearing on the beach.
Leah, leave.
and the wedding-should I get my nails done today or tomorrow on my way to the ceremony?
okay, she's gone.
I got this.
the adrenal system reacts to stress by releasing hormones that makes us alert and reactive.
the problem is, the adrenal system can't tell what's a regular case of nerves and what's a real impending disaster.
did you bring it?
that's the whole thing? - yep.
Lefkowitz has gastroparesis so he can't digest his food.
he was an epic puker for a long time, and now he can't really eat at all.
so we're gonna give you a gastric neurostimulator.
this thing, it's gonna zap your stomach so it remembers to push the food down your system.
get you back on burgers and fries.
that's amazing.
Yeah, well, the guys at the airport x-ray are gonna go nuts.
that's sick.
Oh, uh, this is Dr. Wilson.
she's gonna be operating with me.
you've got a-a crack team, iron man.
don't.
all right, all right. All right. I'll stop. I'll stop. Jeez.
when you and Arizona get to the wedding tomorrow... Don't sit down.
what do you mean, don't sit down?
just find a place and stand there.
you want us to stand in the back?
then we won't be able to hear anything.
stand in the damn front.
and block everybody's view?
I mean, if we're- I don't- Just pick a spot.
you know, it's not complicated.
you know, people allow you to open them up with a knife.
if they knew you couldn't follow a simple instruction, they would run like the wind from this place.
are you... Are you trying to say, "would you do me the honor of being my bridesmaids?
does the whole thing have to be about you?
just put on a dress and don't sit down.
we're bridesmaids.
this is what I was trying to avoid.
now once I remove the sural nerve from your leg, DR. Torres will graft it on to DR. Shepherd's median nerve.
you'll likely experience some discomfort in your leg for a few weeks
months. Months. And when he says "discomfort," it's gonna hurt like hell.
well, you're a bag of sunshine, aren't you?
I don't want to hear six months from now that you can't move and that the ibuprofen hurts your stomach.
he makes me sound like i'm a 90-year-old man. Have you noticed that?
because I've heard for decades how I ruined your life...
because you did. - And that mom doesn't love you.
because she doesn't.
I don't want to hear about this.
I think what you're trying to say is "thank you, lizzie, for cutting off a leg and giving it to me."
here it is. This is how it's gonna go down in history.
it is a nerve. It is not the entire leg.
okay. Let's focus.
Jackson. Um, I think DR. Shepherd's right.
if you're unsure, we - Oh, come on. I'm just winding him up because it is so easy.
just give me the form.
okay.
now can I go hang out with Zola in day care?
Oh, I'm sorry.
they don't let the adults come and go because it's harder on the kids.
I will bring her to you later.
Grey. Uh, when you get to the wedding tomorrow, don't sit down.
the lawyer put together the papers. They're gonna send them over tomorrow.
Oh, I signed a bunch of stuff with them last week.
uh, not the plane crash. The divorce.
that was fast.
I said we wanted to move quickly.
apparently. - It's all done.
you just have to sign.
is that a problem? - Nope. Tomorrow, with a pen.
okay. Everything off from the waist down.
nice paper tablecloth for you.
I'll be right back.
you know, um... I was thinking about telling lizzie if you're okay with that.
um, I think it's still kind of early.
Yeah, but she's doing this thing for me.
she'll tell your whole entire family.
well, you told Cristina.
I haven't. - Still?
there's no point.
I'm probably gonna miscarry anyway.
Meredith - I am just stating the facts.
I have a very unstable uterus.
this baby has an uphill climb.
I am just being realistic.
ready to take a look? - Yeah.
okay, scoot down.
now there's still a lot we can do to support the pregnancy, right, even with our history?
of course.
you've got some risk factors. But we're gonna watch you like a hawk.
okay.
there we go. Hi, baby.
good news. Arizona and I both have red dresses.
now they're not the same, but they are similar.
so it's not like matchy-matchy, but it'll be super cute.
now which part of my face says I want super cute?
get over it already. It's a wedding. No one cares that it's your second other than you.
just hold your nose.
it'll be over in a few hours.
sure. And then we'll be married.
and, oh, him in L. A. me here with my son and a job that's known to take up a great deal of time.
Oh, and he's an intern, because one specialty wasn't enough for him.
let's get to that part.
you know, everyone's acting like I'm some jittery bride.
maybe I have something to jitter about.
well... If it's the marriage you're really worried about...
you can run. - Excuse me?
leave him at the altar. It's a clean break.
he's so pissed that you stood him up in front of all his people, the whole thing is just over.
and then you're not wrestling with a relationship that's doomed or tied to someone for the rest of your life.
I mean, sure, you love each other now.
but the next thing you know, you are cleaning his pee off the ground and going to bed with a foot-wide demilitarized zone down the middle of the bed.
kidding.
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.
no, it-it'll be fine. It'll be fine.
Yeah, ben's the... The best.
he's... he
we have to do an open procede 'cause he's got adhesions from a surgery a couple years ago.
once he's open, you can take down the adhesions.
Really? - Yeah.
I've never done anything like that before.
Yeah, well, if it was me, I'd spend the next few hours in the skills lab.
Dr. Karev. Is this because I told you about when I was a kid?
Oh, yeah. I feel so bad you were a dumpster-diving orphan, I'm letting you hack up a 10 year old.
sorry. Stupid. - Ya think?
flowers, music - It's a recipe for disaster.
april, you're going to be fine.
don't worry about it.
Oh, come on. Don't tell her she's gonna be fine.
you're gonna be looking all pretty, little bit of lip gloss on your prude-y little mouth.
jackson will spot her across the room.
try to look away, but he can't.
you're irresistible in your dress.
one drink, and you're doing the hippity-dippity in the coat room.
the dress? Oh, god.
see? - Cruel.
what? - Nothing.
so he's into you now?
Karev? - No.
then why's he letting you take down adhesions?
have you ever removed adhesions?
no. None of us have.
Hey, Wilson.
uh, where are sujin Kim's post-op notes?
I didn't finish it.
I wanted to practice for this gastric neurostimulator surgery i'm doing with DR. Karev.
she's taking down the adhesions.
Really? Good for you.
he must really trust you.
I hope you're not using blunt dissection,'cause that'll tear it.
you want nice, precise moves with the instruments.
okay. - You sure you're ready for this?
Yeah. You want me to get you that chart?
no. It can wait.
you should practice.
see? She shouldn't even be doing a move like this.
he's into her.
the last thing you want at your wedding is to wonder if Mr. Linzer is circling the drain just because nobody was monitoring his i. n. r.
so I'll just stick around here tomorrow and keep an eye on him.
Kepner, you broke up with avery.
I- yes. Yes.- I-I don't know what that has to
you're afraid that the sight of me in cream colored raw silk will bring tears to your eyes.
I am sure that you will be beautiful - I look at my father, he kisses me on the cheek, I turn away from him, take a breath.
I step towards ben...And you and jackson lock eyes from across the room.
you melt into him like snow in the rain.
I knew you would understand.
suck it up, kepner.
if I have to go, you have to go. - Okay.
if I have to go, you have to go" ?
Oh, drop it.
Oh, no. That's the most beautiful sentiment I've ever heard.
Lizzie's calves are a little shorter than we anticipated.
tall girl, short calves.
so is that gonna be a problem?
no, not if we just get a little more nerve from the other leg.
are you saying to - no.
Derek. - Absolutely not.
no, I never liked this idea in the first place.
we find another donor or we don't do it.
well, we couldn't find another donor.
that's why we - Well, then we're out of luck.
can't we just - no, we can't.
we're not gonna talk about this.
we're not gonna float this past lizzie.
we're not cutting both her legs to remove pieces.
cancel the procedure.
I think you should bring a date to DR. Bailey's wedding.
that way we will focus on our dates and not on each other.
or we could just be focused on the happy couple.
I am wearing a strapless dress.
from here up, i'm completely naked.
just... Wear a different dress.
I don't have a different dress.
I work long hours. I don't shop.
I have-I have one dressy dress.
how am I supposed to find a date with one day's notice?
um, would you like to go to DR. Bailey's wedding?
Oh, what?
Dr. Avery would love for you to go with him.
that's not true.
he thinks that you'd be embarrassed, but you're not embarrassed, are you?
of course she's embarrassed. - She'll get over it.
look, don't get other - Strapless... And tight.
I will pick you up at 1: 00 tomorrow in the locker room.
what just happened?
what about you?
you got to pick mine, so I get to pick yours, right?
Jackson. - What about Shane?
he's a good-looking piece of man, huh?
they're that short?
no, they're perfectly respectable calves.
it's just that we're not gonna get quite enough nerve from just the one.
okay. - I know it's a lot to ask.
no, it's, uh, fine. Do what you need to do.
Derek thinks it's too much to ask, but he really needs this, so if he comes to you and tries to talk you out of it, you have to push.
but don't tell him that I'm the one that came to you, because he won't like that.
you've got some balls, don't you?
you know, if it's too much, we can call the whole thing off.
you know we're family, right?
there was no wedding, Meredith.
you adopted a baby and you never invited us to come meet her.
you never accepted our invitation to come see us.
all we got was a couple of pictures via e-mail.
you know, my kids were so excited that for months, they walked around telling every african-american person they saw that we have a brown baby in the family?
a year later, they kind of think I made the whole thing up.
I'm sorry. It's just, you know, with everything that's been going on
no, I get that we're all busy, but you're not shy about asking me for a couple of body parts, and now you want me to cover your tracks with Derek?
if you feel like it's inappropriate, we - No, it's what sisters ask sisters to do.
we cover each other's asses.
look, if you want to be a sister, I am delighted, but then act like one.
my version of family isn't like your version.
you guys give each other crap and then you laugh about it.
you'd walk through fire for each other.
greys are not like that.
Derek said you had a sister who worked here.
half. - She was on the plane?
you know, I-I really don't want to talk about my sister.
my husband really needs this, so you don't have to like me, just-just him.
you have a child.
she's part of my family.
you of all people should realize, you need spares in a family.
you need as many as you can get.
it was very nice to talk to you, lizzie.
I stashed a little johnnie in case the ceremony's got some cousin reading a poem.
right. Uh, I meant to find you.
I'm kind of bringing a date.
Yeah, me. Two guys picking up bridesmaids from out of town.
april's convinced that if we don't both bring dates, then we're both gonna end up...
why you gotta talk to her?
she ruins everything.
how about I find someone for you to go with?
you know, maybe Stephanie has a friend.
Stephanie? That's who you're taking?
you want a date or not? - no.
all right.
okay. Whatever. Just don't get me an ugly one.
we're not doing the procedure.
of course we're doing it.
you know what happened when I said I'd do this?
mom called me three times in one day.
it Just brings tears to my eyes.
she's a mess.
come on. You're the golden child.
the rest of us are just scrapping for second position,
you think I'm giving that up just 'cause you have to cut into two legs instead of one?
Lizzie - No, we're not discussing it. I've decided.
get back on the horse, Derek.
Oh, okay. So you think I'm using this as an excuse, that I'm too scared to try and operate again?
no, of course not. Nothing scares you.
what if it doesn't work? Hmm?
what if we go through all of this and nothing comes of it?
well, then at least we tried.
you ready? - yep.
Bovie, please.
thank you.
okay, here? - yep.
take your time. - Okay.
watch out for the blood vessels.
look at you, all grown-up.
you put a hole in his stomach.
I haven't even - Move, now.
move. All right. Clamp.
here you go. 2. 0 vicryl.
I'll get it. - Suction.
Hey, Steph. You okay there?
fine. - Terrific.
I wanted to ask you- I was gonna go to the wedding with, you know, a friend- A guy, like, stag.
yeah?
and now he feels like i'm bailing on him.
you don't have to go with me.
no, no. You don't want to go?
you have a date with guy.
I ditched him, and I want you to find somebody for him.
is that weird?
nothing about this is weird.
terrific.
there's still some spillage.
give me some lap pads... And some 2. 0 silk.
get over here and grab the retractor so we can put the device back in.
Wilson. - I can't get my hands to stay still.
well, shake it off and get over here.
the kid's gonna be fine, just grab the damn retractor.
get out.
go!
you think bailey will notice if I'm not there?
she just made you a bridesmaid.
Oh, she doesn't care about all of that.
she just wants a bunch of people standing up there so it won't look weird when ben has all his guys standing up there.
and I have a packed day tomorrow.
yeah,'cause you're going to a wedding.
you're supposed to wear heels... To a fancy occasion.
Oh, come on.
no, they make you feel tall and confident and feminine and
and my plastic foot isn't the right shape for...
heels.
I didn't get that kind.
well, I mean - It's not nothing.
I mean, why do you think women all over the world wear them?
because women all over the world are stupid.
Oh, okay. So you're gonna wear flats?
Oh, I'd be happy to wear flats.
Oh, no, you wouldn't because then you would feel dumpy.
did you just call me dumpy?
can you just for one second admit that you know what it is i'm talking about?
okay, I know it's hard.
it's hard all the time, and this is just one more reminder.
but you are so, so beautiful.
Yeah, people stand next to you and immediately feel bad about themselves.
it's a public service that you're a couple of inches shorter.
it is a kindness to every other woman at that wedding that you are just one tiny bit less beautiful.
Yeah.
are you still mad at me because I called Llizzie?
do you still love me?
medium.
I just want your hand to be better so that we can put this stupid plane crash stuff behind us.
well, the lawyer called to schedule a deposition.
he thinks we have a strong case, especially now that cristina and owen are getting divorced.
what does that have to do with anything?
well, it'd be a big conflict of interest if Owen was married to one of the plaintiffs.
that's why they got divorced, right?
she didn't tell you?
no.
why would she not tell me that?
you didn't tell her you were pregnant.
maybe things are different now.
on the morning of your wedding?
Oh, my house is filled with my family talking about makeup and hair.
just check into a hotel. - DR. Bailey.
take a nice long bath, get a manicure.
Oh, now I got you talking about makeup and hair?
Dr. Bailey, what are you doing here?
checking up on my patients.
making sure you haven't bungled anything.
don't mention her hair.
Why? Did something happen to your hair?
he probably knew it was risky, so he wanted it on me and not him.
you have to stop. You're making yourself crazy.
I'm gonna get fired.
no, you're not.
just keep your head down and do your work.
you're right.
now I have to ask you something, and in light of the fact that you think your job is on the line, it's gonna sound really stupid.
whatever. It's okay.
Dr. Avery asked me to DR. Bailey's wedding.
and I can't put two words together into a sentence when I'm within 2 feet of him, and he's bringing a friend, and he asked me to bring a friend, and it'll be like a bunch of us, and we'll all go together.
you're right. It sounds really stupid.
but will you do it?
please.
somebody page cardio?
Yeah, g.s.w.To the chest.
we put up 2 and a half liters of blood when we put in the chest tube.
we should move him upstairs.
there is a bullet in the abdomen. I can do it, or we can call for somebody else.
you can do it. Amicable, right?
let's move.
you're still rechecking Kepner's work?
what I was born to do.
I have a chole in about ten minutes.
in and out, the whole thing should take an hour.
you want to scrub in?
take the edge off before you go home and get dressed?
you... Are a good man.
Dr. Webber.
Oh, the man of the hour.
Oh, tell me you're not here to take me back to that house.
no, I'm-i'm not.
okay, well, he, um, just asked me to do a chole with him...
and it's the only thing that's calmed me down on a day full of people trying and failing to calm me down.
why do you think he asked you?
you called him?
thank you.
both of you.
so can I have a car pick you up at the house?
how many times do I have to say no to that?
a person shouldn't drive themselves to their own wedding.
well, I like to drive.
in a wedding gown?
it's my last ten minutes as a single woman.
you know, you both were on a roll there.
why are you trying to screw it up now?
I'll see you in the o. r. - And I will see you at the altar.
Dr. Robbins.
Yeah. - DR. Karev had me take down the adhesions.
Yeah. Yeah, how'd that go?
some of the adhesions were stuck to the stomach.
the stomach was injured. He could be septic by now.
I don't think he had any business having an intern do that kind of move.
I mean, you were pretty shocked to hear that I was doing it.
he threw me in the deep end, probably because - Okay, hang on.
what exactly are you saying about your attending?
G. s.w. - Sweet.
scrubbing in with Owen, who wants to sign our divorce papers today.
I guess we're being mature and moving on.
speaking of which, why didn't you tell me that the divorce was because of the plane crash lawsuit?
what?
Derek told me, so that.
which is great, I'm glad, especially if it means the two of you are getting back together.
it's good news, and I don't know why you wouldn't want to share that with me?
because I didn't know.
you ready?
what?
Dr. Shepherd's prepped?
Yep. - Uh, DR. Torres is going over the studies.
okay. - Yeah.
hold it together.
well, a nerve extraction's a pretty simple procedure.
not that.
he asked me on a date, to DR. Bailey's wedding.
Dr. Kepner asked me.
it's a date?
it's not, like, a mentoring thing?
how is drinking champagne and dancing to barry white a mentoring thing?
I thought it was, like, spending time getting to know the interns in a casual, stress-free environment.
that was the free-doughnuts thing in the lounge.
this is a wedding.
I can't go on a date with my boss.
I need to focus on my work, not get all wrapped up in the ladies.
did you really just say "the ladies" ?
you're the one who just said you couldn't concentrate in the o. r.
cause DR. Avery might look at you with his limpid green eyes.
the eyes are really intense.
you've noticed it yourself, right?
get a grip. - You get a grip.
Karev, did you tell Wilson that she'd be fired for screwing up a gastric implant?
what? - Is the patient gonna make it?
the patient's fine.
what the hell did she tell you?
she thinks that you set her up to take the fall on a risky o. r. Procedure, and it kind of sounds like you did.
it would've been risky no matter who did it.
and I was standing right there.
the second it got hairy, I took over.
she was in over her head.
and where do you think I got the idea to do something like that?
what are you talking about?
you.
I'm trying to be like you were with me.
you let me try crap so I got confidence in myself.
that's what I was trying to do
not treat the stupid morons like the stupid morons that I think they are.
I gave you opportunities.
I also gave you a boatload of encouragement and support.
I didn't drop-kick you into the deep end of the pool... And yell,"swim, idiot."
you're a teacher now.
your students fail, you've failed.
glad you're driving yourself to the wedding.
remind me to stay off the roads.
were you like this?
on my wedding day, I remember staring at my socks for a long time.
I had no idea what to do with 'em.
you know, ten years from now, if the marriage is strong, I'll look back at today and say...
it was just a little bit of cold feet.
if we're in a nasty divorce, I'll say, " I knew it was a mistake the day we got married" .
you think it's a mistake?
I just feel... Worried.
I never felt that way with Tucker.
you were a child when you married tucker.
you're an adult now.
you know the world's an ambiguous place.
you know that love doesn't conquer all.
it conquers some stuff.
the other stuff kicks the living crap out of love.
and this is the pep talk?
overwhelming doubt is a problem.
a little bit of doubt is just a sign of an intelligent adult.
is Grey gonna be in the gallery?
no. She didn't want to make you nervous.
I told her you don't get nervous.
you're right. I don't.
close your eyes. Enjoy your nap.
you've got nothing to worry about.
you've got nothing to worry about.
we good to go? - Yes, we are.
Yes. We're-yes.
Jackson, I just want to let you know, I'll be here watching the whole time.
couldn't be happier.
no mistakes. - That's the plan.
okay.
are you kidding me?
get that woman out of my gallery.
that's not a good idea. - Get her out.
I heard that, Avery. Edwards, don't even think about it.
now.
edwards, you wouldn't dare.
you have years with me.
I can be very difficult to deal with.
15-blade, please.
you narced on me to my boss?
I worked hard to get here.
I'm not gonna let myself get fired because - Nobody's firing you.
I was trying to help you.
I clearly wasn't ready for it.
why, because I had to take over?
look, you can't go crying to my damn boss every time you get scared.
you can't cry at all when you get scared because it's scary in there all the time.
I just thought, maybe after I blew the appy, I'd be a good target if you needed to pin something on someone.
it's paranoid. I get that. I don't always trust people who are trying to help me.
Yeah, yeah, you're a beaten dog and you bite people who try to feed you.
I don't give a crap about your sad story.
you want to be a surgeon, you need to get the hell over it.
you burned a bridge with me.
how about you grow up before you burn a bridge with every other attending who tries to teach you something?
50 centimeters of prime nerve.
great.
all right. Forceps, please. Thank you.
okay.
is no one making small talk because this is Derek Shepherd on the table?
this is intricate work.
small talk is what keeps us awake.
well, uh... A couple of days ago, I helped DR. Kepner extract a malignant mass from the gluteal area of a female patient.
it-it was an impressively sized mass.
who's gonna tell DR. Shepherd that he'll never operate again because ross' idea of gossip is, he saw April Kepner take a lump off an ass?
brooks, suction.
all of, not half of it.
sorry.
he's got a bunch of tattoos.
wonder if it's some sort of a gang thing.
I had has little bearing on how we treat this patient.
what the hell was that? I thought this was supposed to be amicable.
we're getting divorced because of the lawsuit?
it will significantly increase your chances - You didn't want to mention it?
I want you to get the money.
I want all of you to get the money, and I knew there was a very real chance that you would reject the idea simply because I suggested it.
Oh, right. Because I'm so simple-minded and petulant.
you've been known to
where do you get off making some kind of unilateral decision about our marriage?
how about the fact that you moved across the country and didn't have the courage to do what I did and simply ask for a divorce?
Oh, god. So this is ballsy, you hiding behind the lawsuit?
you couldn't just admit to me, or-or-or god sake, yourself, that you wanted out.
you have to let this stupid plane crash make the decision for you.
I chose the airline!
you like it better when I decide?!
I chose the airline!
we had to make a budget cut of 4%...
and we had a line item of emergency transportation.
we never used it, and we had a... Fancy charter company, and I chose a... Cheaper one.
you want to know why it was cheaper?
you didn't build the plane.
Peoplere dead.
or fly it.
I thought you were dead.
you're not responsible.
someone has to be.
I mean, it takes a lot of small m mistas to destroy something, and it's really easy for everybody involved just to say,"ah, I just did this one small thing" .
a bunch of people made it possible...
for a bad plane to take off with you, meredith, and derek, and Arizona, and...
and I am one of those people.
I think I'm having a dream a really hot doctor came to take care of me.
this really hot doctor is leaving you to go to a party.
Callie said it could not have gone better.
do you have any pain? - no.
how's lizzie?
uh, she's doing well. She was still sleeping last time I checked.
I'll swing by on my way out.
it may have worked.
and we're back on the shoes.
please don't even say it out loud.
it makes me feel even more stupid.
just... Tell her that I wasn't feeling well.
you've gotta be kidding me.
do not belittle me, okay?
you have no idea what it's like - Oh, trust me, trust me,
I am intimately familiar with what's going on, and I'm over it.
you are exactly the same person you were before, just minus a leg.
you think it's nothing?
no. Oh, no, no, no, no.
I think it's everything.
and-and you know what? It has been... For months.
and I have been supportive for months.
but there comes a point where you have to suck it up and stop whining and start living.
okay, so you have one leg.
it's a wedding. It's a wedding.
and weddings are sweet and beautiful and n-no one's gonna notice the stupid leg because everybody's gonna be looking at bailey, and maybe for one night, our lives can be about something other than that damn leg.
my whole life is about that leg.
I haven't had sex in five months because of the leg.
enough about the leg!
everything went smoothly. Your vitals look great.
and Derek is awake, and he's in good shape.
Meredith, I'm pushy.
I get that.
some people find it endearing, and some people really don't, but, um...
you don't have to want Derek's truckload of sisters in your life.
Yeah. You are a pain in the ass.
and I barely know you.
okay, so... I'm not very good at this.
but I'm gonna try.
I'm gonna show you something, but you have to promise not to blab it to the whole family.
okay.
promise? - Yeah.
okay.
you? - Really?
we're having a baby.
Yeah. yay!
let her drive you, Miranda.
no, mom.
I just need five minutes with none of you touching me.
so did she bring her friend or what?
Oh, come on.
he's the guy?
was the lawsuit the only reason you asked for a divorce?
there are many reasons.
you were... done A long time ago.
I'm asking about you.
okay, let me put it another way.
I wanted to-to try again.
I was gonna ask you if we could try again, and you said," I want a divorce."
sorry.
I should throw this thing out the window.
hello. Sir, this is Barrett in the e. r.
your wife is on her way here.
paramedics say she's vomiting blood.
what? - Adele?
she's hypotensive.
um, hey, uh, turn the car around.
we need to go to the emergency room At Seattle grace hospital right now.
wasn't this stupid thing supposed to start already?
I'm-I'm-I'm here, sweetheart.
why is this happening?
we're gonna find out.
how much blood has she lost?
at least a liter, a liter and a half.
it started about 45 minutes ago.
Oh, god! It hurts.
hang more l. r. - No, not if she's lost that much blood.
she needs a transfusion and an n. g. Tube. I've got this, okay?
sir, she's your wife.
step back.
get me an n. g.Tube, son. - I can do this.
get me an n. g.Tube right now. - Okay, I got it.
you hear me?
okay. Get out of the way.
okay. Central line kit, please.
Yes, doctor. - Yeah, yeah, Leah. Get me out of this dress now.
Adele, hi. Can you look at me?
Hey, we're gonna take good care of you, okay?
she's having ventricular couplets.
all right, watch for v-tach.
prep the i. j.
okay, you're gonna be fine, baby.
we got you.
all right. Get the guide wire ready.
she's losing consciousness.
Bailey! - Damn it. All right.
uh, Barrett, take this.
do a femoral line instead.
uh, Leah, intubation tray.
Oh, god, Adele.
Oh, god.
Oh, come on, come on, come on.
Oh, straight to voice mail.
um, it's possible that I may have, by mistake, said that if she had any doubts, she should flee.
what? why?
well, I kind of said that marriage is like a dance of death and that leaving him at the altar would be a painful but efficient out.
Oh, that's nice.
I was joking... And she was nervous, okay?
and she wasn't sure if it was the wedding or the whole thing.
the marriage?
she was nervous.
how nervous?
how nervous was she, Callie?
it's a big day.
Yeah. I'm excited about it.
what are you talking about?
today is the last day of your first trimester.
I'm talking about the plane crash.
the judge could have a decision today about whether the hospital is at fault or not.
well, that's not gonna happen.
the lawyers moved for summary judgment.
well, that is a formality. Then it's gonna go to trial. It's gonna take months for a decision.
maybe not.
Meredith, your first trimester is over.
let's focus on that.
try and relax a little bit. Enjoy it.
tell your twisted sister. She'll be happy for you.
the big day is here... the day you're gonna hear the news, the test result.
is the biopsy malignant or benign?
am I gonna live or die?
you just want to know.
breakfast for two?
even if the news is scary.
Ah, god. Oh, my god.
uh... What are you doing? - I'm sorry.
I thought you were Cristina, and you're not.
definitely not. - No
because then you can move on, whatever that means.
you didn't? - Yeah. I did. It's...it's not funny. - Oh, I know. I know.
God. - It's not. It's hilarious.
it was humiliating.
if you wear pants, it doesn't happen as much.
I just got up.
I was looking for a glass for water 'cause I'm hung over.
and why are there no glasses or... or mugs or anything?
you're pretty loud for a hung-over girl.
the chief of surgery just felt me up.
and I had to sleep on your living room floor because you have no furniture, and now I have a neck ache.
being your friend is basically ruining my life.
I've heard that before.
you're a douche. Get a couch, or I'm never drinking with you again.
look, if you're thirsty, all you gotta do is stick your face under the faucet.
Oh, okay. I'm going to the hospital where there's food and paper cups.
sir. From my mom. Cookies.
Oh, you know, that's not necess...
Oh, and there's a message that I am supposed to read to you, make sure you get it.
Richard, I am in town doing a case at Seattle Pres.
left you several messages and wasn't sure you got them.
uh, to be clear, that was her and not me.
well, please tell her I'm fine.
Oh, no, you gotta take the cookies, sir.
that's such a nice gesture, but I'm trying to avoid sweets.
uh, would you like them?
um, I can put them in the lounge, and everybody can enjoy them.
Oh, that's a fine idea.
morning.
Hey, I heard there might be a judgment today. I hope it works out for you.
no, you don't.
a judgment comes down that quickly, it means the hospital's negligent.
it means you did something wrong.
which you did.
well, you've obviously been thinking that for a while.
I'm glad you... finally got it out in the open.
and for the record, I really do hope it works out for you.
I heard your girlfriend did a little panty dance in the kitchen this morning.
she's not my girlfriend.
look, I know it's weird.
she's hot and she's always around, but I don't even think of her like that.
it'd be like you and I sleeping together.
I'm trying to eat my breakfast.
did you hear your husband accidentally copped a feel?
Yeah. Oh, and he's not my husband.
that's why he's sneaking in at the crack of crack.
you are a messed up broad.
Dr. Webber rejected my mother's cookies.
that sounds dirty.
she's worried about him.
she wants me to assess his mood. She thinks he's depressed.
well, his wife died a month ago.
isn't he supposed to be depressed?
of course, but, like, normal depressed or too depressed?
I mean, he's fine. He's back at work.
Nah, but he's not operating.
maybe you should hold him.
and I'm done.
enjoy the cookies.
Thanks.
so what do you mean, he touched your boobs?
like "Wah-wah"?
he's not a 13-year-old girl. He's the chief of surgery.
well, I'm sorry that I don't know how the chief of surgery touches boobs...
but was it, like, a glancing thing, like-like side boob?
Heather. Show me what happened.
no. Was it... look.
was it like this?
no, it was like a move up the front.
Yes.
Murphy, let's go. We got a facial reconstruction.
I gotta go, too.
I'm working with Dr. Shepherd.
I think he's back for real today... Operating.
I think we're all happy about that.
I've got post-ops with Yang.
I'm on Grey.
with Grey.
on Grey sounds... - Dr. Avery, I'm just on scut.
if you don't mind, can I tag along?
I don't know. Um... sure, I guess. Come on.
quick question about the case.
that... was good.
you like that, throwing Murphy on my service?
and made me beg to tag along.
now you understand that it's in both of our interests to keep this thing quiet, right?
relax.
do you really think I want anyone to think I'm getting surgeries because I'm sleeping with my boss?
I want to get them because of my awesomeness.
well, that's true, because you are extremely awesome.
and that is how... - Oh, what were you saying?
they invented the shunt. - That is fascinating.
Yeah.
so I think our big mistake last time was, we tried to get you back too fast.
so this time, baby steps.
Torres... - Who's the patient?
I'm the patient. - That's right.
now... this is the same muscle movement you use with Leskell Rongeur.
basically, the same motion as hitting a ping-pong ball.
so that is what you're gonna do today.
for how long?
uh, how long did your last meningioma removal take?
it was eight hours, I think.
well... We're gonna play ping-pong for eight hours?
not me. I've got surgery.
well, then who?
morning. We back in the saddle?
what?
you're gonna love this one.
what, M.V. C.G. S.W? - Better.
stripper pole.
vitals stable in the field.
has abdominal tenderness from a crush injury.
she slipped. Make sure she's all right.
off a pole?
it was our anniversary. They installed it right in the bedroom.
I wanted it to be a surprise.
it was. I thought I was getting an iPad.
Where'd you get the cookies?
Webber didn't want the pity cookies from his girlfriend about his dead wife.
he's not operating, so Jackson's "Mommy" was worried.
whatever. These cookies are awesome.
what about Jackson?
are you still pining over Jackson?
no. God. No.
Why? Is he seeing someone?
april, April... Jackson is like a cookie.
people want to lose weight, they don't eat the cookie.
but then they get so hung up on not having the cookie that their whole life is about the cookie.
my whole life is not about the cookie.
is your whole life about the cookie?
what do you mean?
you and Owen, are you guys a thing again or...
I don't know.
all I know is, having sex with a man who used to be your husband is way more fun than when he is your husband.
that's all you know? - That is all I know.
unless there's something else you... want to tell me?
no. Nothing I can think of.
okay, then. - Okay.
Hey, Cristina.
nice shot, Dr. Shepherd.
you put a little something on that backhand?
7 serving 2.
Hey, Derek. Answer your phone.
we're in the middle of a game.
well, you know what?
not anymore.
the lawyer called, and they need us at the courthouse.
now.
did I miss it?
damn it. I'm sorry.
I got out of the O. R. as fast as I could, but I didn't think it was gonna happen today.
Oh, god. Was it bad?
it wasn't? - We won.
he said the airline company had a history of mechanical problems with the plane.
it was in public record, and the hospital should've known.
he found the hospital negligent.
so we won.
when's he gonna tell us about the award?
I mean... I hate to be all about the money... - He already did.
he's giving us $15 million.
each.
so what happens now, the hospital hands us a check for $15 million?
Oh, well, their insurance company does, and it'll probably take some time to get through all the bureaucratic rigmarole, but, yeah.
pending appeal, the insurance company will issue each of you a big check.
in the meantime, I have a ping-pong ball to hit.
Yeah, I gotta get back, too. I have James Leggett's surgery.
Oh, how is James?
well, that's right.
you and Mark did his original cranial expansion.
wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Why is everyone rushing off?
this is a momentous event.
shouldn't we do something, like celebrate or...
okay, maybe "Celebrate's" too strong a word. Dinner.
we should have a dinner. Come on.
we've been sitting in rooms with each other for months talking about this, and we just won.
what's wrong with sitting in one more room with food in front of us?
I'm gonna do a quick exam.
I don't know what happened.
I was doing a sexy flexy, next thing I know, I was on the floor.
a sexy flexy?
it's a move.
I could do it perfectly in class.
uh, uh, you have a bruise near your tailbone.
you must have landed on a hard surface.
I landed on my husband.
and there was nothing hard about him.
Leonard Olsen, 67, came in via E. M. S.
his wife was on a stripper pole and fell on him while trying to execute a move called a sexy flexy.
his physical exam indicates possible internal injuries.
so why don't you get Mr. Olsen's past medical history while I order a scan?
see that? Your face?
now imagine how I felt.
we could buy a house.
we have a house.
we could buy another house.
we could buy five houses.
we could buy five houses with yards as big as football fields.
we could buy the team to play on the football field.
who would play against them?
well, we'd buy another team.
I just wanted a house.
mo' money, mo' problems.
I should've been on that damn plane.
James was born with Crouzon syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones, resulting in...
a weird-looking face. - James.
fine. A tall narrow head, wide-set eyes, and a small midface.
now over the years, Dr. Sloan has operated on James...five separate times to... - Try and make me less weird looking.
James. - What?
even Sloan said I was weird looking, and you worshipped him.
my mom thought Sloan walked on water. No pressure.
Dr. Sloan was great with him.
I really can't believe he's gone.
I know, and I know that this isn't easy, trusting the new guy.
you were Sloan's guy.
that's all we need to know.
the only person who liked Sloan more than my mom was my dad.
again... - No pressure. I got it. Okay.
I know that Dr. Sloan's plan called for this final operation to consist of simply moving the upper jaw forward.
I am recommending a monobloc advancement, which means, Dr. Edwards?
cutting into your skull and moving the whole midface...forward in one block.
excellent job, Dr. Edwards.
thank you, Dr. Avery.
uh... if this is a better procedure, why didn't Sloan suggest it?
for one thing, Dr. Sloan did not anticipate that James' forehead would still be this disproportionately underdeveloped.
Hey, everybody. Sorry I'm late. What's up?
Dr. Avery was just explaining the new plan.
mark had a plan.
and I have a different plan, which gives James a more normal appearance.
but Mark knew James for 16 years.
you've known him for, like, uh, 16 minutes.
you know what? If Mark was here, then I would be glad to have this argument with him.
he was a plastic surgeon.
this not your area of expertise.
so if you want me to walk you through my thought process, I guess I can do that as a courtesy.
what I'm not gonna do is stand here and argue with you about this procedure. This is what I'm doing.
you'll walk me through your thought process as a courtesy?
are you kidding me?
I'll wait. - All right.
I'm just not ready for Callie's dinner tonight. It's too weird.
I know. How long do you think till these parasites are hitting us up for a lung?
Dr. Grey. - That was fast.
glad you're back. I have a patient.
she's a 19-year-old college kid, nauseated with a distended stomach.
and she says there's no way that she's pregnant.
Oh, everybody always says that, and then they always end up pregnant.
okay, but if the pregnancy test is negative?
okay, I will come with you.
but I am not taking point, you are.
Yeah, you know, that really is a problem, people claiming not to be pregnant when they really are.
you know?
of course I know.
her boobs got huge about two weeks ago, and she's eating everything in sight.
but she didn't tell you?
no, but... she knows I know.
so you know she knows that you know?
she'll tell me when she's ready to be happy about it.
Congratulations.
you're not pregnant.
of course she's not pregnant.
Taylor knows better than to bring boys home.
she knows she needs to focus on her studies.
get your hair out of your mouth.
Taylor, do you mind if I take a look at your stomach?
of course you can take a look. You're the doctor.
does that hurt?
have you been constipated?
I don't know.
speak up. No one can hear you when you're mumbling.
Yes. - Yes, what? Yes, you're constipated?
the doctors aren't mind readers.
okay, she's not constipated.
okay. - She's just throwing up.
Mrs. Lanz, do you mind if we step outside while the doctor examines Taylor?
Taylor doesn't mind if I stay. Do you? - Oh, it'll just take a second.
that was awesome.
so... you need to talk to the patient, not the mother.
if the mother interrupts you, you stop her.
so let's start again.
Robbins is concerned.
Yeah, well, she shouldn't be. I've thought this through.
I've got a solid plan.
so did Sloan.
I did James' first surgery with Mark when we still lived in New York.
Yeah, I know. I've read through Sloan's notes.
how old is James now? - He's 16.
when you're 16, you're worried about your S. A.T. score, your future.
Yeah, well, so am I.
this is gonna improve his appearance by 5% to 10%.
but at what cost?
it's riskier. It's complicated recovery time. I would stick with Sloan's plan.
I got a message about a consult.
Oh, yeah. Chest X-ray came back.
turned out to be heartburn.
Oh, god. There's... - Why is she coming over here?
she's on my service.
relax.
Dr. Yang, I did orthostatics on 21-14.
Hey, you know, uh, you know, your hair and hers...
you know, from behind kind of... - Yeah, no. Totally honest mistake.
Yeah. - Okay, these results are weird.
schedule a tilt table test.
I said "Relax," not make it worse.
what?
are you trying to see if it's really me or some intern?
I'm... relieved.
I heard about the judgment. - Yeah?
it hasn't really sunk in yet.
Hey, will you come to this thing with me tonight?
uh, depends. What's the thing?
Oh, it's dumb.
Callie wants to have a survivors dinner.
it sounds morbid to me, actually.
but if you come, it could be fun.
I mean, I could get drunk and dance on a table. Promise.
that's... I... Shepherd doesn't want me there. - Why?
he blames me. And I get it. I'm the bad guy.
and I don't know if I want to be forgiven.
don't play martyr.
I'm not. I'm... this is... I am partially responsible.
so if Shepherd doesn't want me around... - Okay, you know what I think?
I think Derek Shepherd...
let's just leave the case and the crash in the past outside, and just be here right now.
just you and me.
okay.
so now what?
now... you take your shirt off.
okay. You can take off your pants.
Bailey said I would find you here.
what is this place?
well, it's my hall of horrors.
at least that's what Adele used to call it.
malignant teratoma resected from a liver in 1985.
this thing is 27 years old?
it was the first in my collection.
I'm cataloging it, and then medical waste is gonna come and take it all away.
I remember this guy.
this is the guy who swallowed all the pennies. This was my intern year.
that's Ron Newsome.
he swallowed these scissors a year later.
and why do you want to get rid of all this stuff?
what do you want, Grey?
I came to ask you if you would like to scrub in on a surgery.
a very cool case, a 19-year-old girl with an unknown mass in her abdomen.
I'm busy.
Richard, I'm worried.
no need to worry.
I've heard you haven't been operating.
I'm fine. I don't need your help.
I need to be left alone.
so please let me do what I'm doing.
okay.
you called Shepherd on me?
he's not on James' case anymore.
Hey, uh, quick question about the sitter for tonight.
uh, yeah. Hold on for one second.
well... I don't know about the dinner.
it just... it feels weird.
we're doing the dinner, okay?
um, curly hair can't sit.
so I was gonna...
what do you think?
I think that you should learn their names, and you should call Claudia because Kelli has only sat for us once, and I don't want Sofia with someone new.
great. Um, Claudia is... - Okay...
unibrow. - Right. Yeah.
this is why I went to Derek, okay?
mark knew James. He was with him from the beginning.
and you're just the new babysitter who doesn't know where we keep the extra wipes at.
I waited around here for you to insult me again?
I'm sorry. It's been a weird morning.
and... but Mark was so invested and so...
I was coming to tell you that I changed my mind.
I'm now doing the procedure Sloan's way.
Oh, great. Thanks. Sorry.
your husband's scans show that a rib punctured his diaphragm when you...landed on him.
we're gonna need to operate, but I'm confident we can fix the problem.
Oh, thank god. I feel so terrible.
here you go, Sheila. This will make your ride to radiology more comfortable.
now about that X-ray... Is it okay if I have metal on my...
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
you... bedazzled your vagina?
it's called vajazzling.
all the stars are doing it.
Oh, it's a butterfly.
look. That's the body and those... those are the wings.
that's game.
you win again, Dr. Shepherd.
wait. Just stop.
great. This was fun.
I think you're letting me win.
you're a smart man.
I am. - So am I.
that's why I'm absolutely letting you win.
whupping your ass wouldn't be a smart move, especially since you're a competitive guy who likes to win.
do you know who else is a competitive guy, Ross?
a neurosurgeon.
I thought you had what it takes to be one.
see? I am a smart man, and you are now goading me.
but you won't like it when you lose.
Oh,"when" I lose?
you'll be angry and never want to see my face.
that won't help me on my quest to become you.
Yeah, I've told you, it's creepy when you say that.
sorry. It is what it is.
I need a real test, Ross, okay?
Dr. Ramsey has a chiari decompression tomorrow, and I'm sure she needs someone to help assist.
if you beat me in this game, I will put in a...
is that for me? Thanks.
Catherine, what are you doing here?
I'm taking you to lunch.
we have reservations at The Firefly.
I don't have surgery until later on, and I couldn't just sit in my hotel knowing that you're 5 miles away and I haven't laid eyes on you.
well, I've... I've been busy.
I haven't had time to check... - Richard, Jackson told me you're not operating.
I'm worried about you. You look thin. Are you eating? Are you sleeping?
look, you're not my wife.
so you don't get to... My wife died.
while I was carrying on with another woman, my wife died, Catherine.
so what I'm eating and how I'm sleeping is not your concern.
I haven't returned your calls because I don't want to go to lunch.
I don't want cookies. I don't want you here.
if you'll excuse me now, Grey and I have a surgery.
so what's the plan for the house? I'm sick of sitting on the floor.
nice!
shepherd scores.
Ah, waiting out Yang.
she's gonna break down and furnish the whole house.
what? - It's genius.
Yes!
you got it Shepherd.
Wilson, your friend's choking.
you want to make this interesting?
100 bucks says Shane wins.
you don't have 100 bucks.
I won't eat for a month.
who's, uh, who's winning?
he's got Shane on the ropes.
please. Shepherd's meat.
watch Shane's dead ball.
that's my wrist in there.
Wilson, it's not too late to back down.
I'm a gentleman. I'll let you walk away.
Ah, damn it!
500 bucks.
okay, how about we take a break?
let me take a look at that wrist.
the wrist isn't the problem. It's his feet.
they're not as fast as mine 'cause he's an old man.
sorry, Dr. Shepherd. I don't know where that came from.
I occasionally get carried away while engaging in athletic...
okay. 9-8.
uh... let's go, bitch.
okay, boys, I trust that you remember, this is not Wimbledon, but a hospital conference room table where you are working on strengthening your muscles
so that one day soon you can operate again.
also, respond to my e-mail about the dinner tonight and let everyone know you're very excited about it.
what if I'm not?
come on, Derek. If you go, everyone will.
play is continuous.
what dinner?
they won the crash case.
$15 mil each.
Hey, Dr. Yang, congratulations on winning the case.
are you gonna spend some of that money on furniture for the house?
Why? It's not my house.
Yeah. You're a genius.
my turn.
you need to forgive Owen.
for what? - You're holding a grudge.
you make it sound like he stole my lunch from the refrigerator.
Derek, we won.
we get to move on.
and we have to let Owen do the same.
he put us on that plane.
you know what? You were chief once.
you make a bunch of decisions based on what you know at the time.
forgive him.
it's not that easy.
I know. Forgive him anyway.
let's go.
Wilson, you're working not playing ping-pong.
500 bucks. Let me know how it goes.
you are gonna do great.
I'll come back tomorrow after volleyball practice.
I know. My girlfriend's hot.
you're wondering how I do it.
no. No.
Yeah. Sloan... telling me I was weird looking.
he wasn't being a jerk.
it was just that surgery was only gonna take me so far.
I was never gonna look completely normal, so...
I was gonna have to develop some moves to get the women.
so he gave you a couple of tips.
getting women was kind of his specialty.
Nah. Sloan said his moves would never work for me. I had to come up with my own.
so I blind them with my amazing personality.
they don't even notice the weird-looking face.
well, it looks like it's working.
I do all right.
although not being weird looking would be cool, too.
again, no pressure.
let's see what we can do about that.
whatever happened to just regular old sex, without poles or vaginas dressed up in rhinestone?
when did just plain old "get naked" become boring?
antibiotic lavage.
and I suppose men do it, too, bedazzle their penis?
I'm really trying not to think about it.
somebody look that up.
on it.
just foolish. Idiotic.
Kepner, you ever vajazzled yourself?
Oh, right.
Jesus isn't a fan of the vajazzle.
feel good being back in the O. R?
Grey... let's focus on the patient.
opening the stomach. Babcock clamp.
here you go.
lap pads.
look at that thing.
well, would you look at that.
a bezoar.
it's a giant hairball.
like from eating your hair?
like from eating your hair.
I used to eat dirt.
I haven't in years.
you got here just in time to lose.
final point, advantage Ross.
Ah, Shepherd's got this.
double or nothing.
what's the matter, you scared?
fine. You're on.
1, 000 bucks. - Shane!
come on, Shepherd! You got it!
Ah, yes!
damn it.
Yes! Oh, yeah. Yes.
one more game.
no way. I won it.
I get to assist on Ramsey's surgery.
get on that phone right now and you call her, or I swear to god, I'll...
sir, again, I don't know what came over me.
what I meant to say is, I'd appreciate the opportunity.
Yeah. Fine. One more game.
this time, I play with my dominate hand.
Oh, yeah. It feels so good.
$1, 000. - I'll get it to you later.
I gotta go to the cash machine.
Oh, I'm headed that way myself. I'll come with you.
it's too cool to let it go to medical waste.
how are you gonna throw all this stuff away?
you know what I see when I look at the scissors Ron Newsome swallowed?
I see the thanksgiving that I didn't take off so I didn't join Adele in London.
the teratoma kept me from our anniversary party.
black tie.
she planned the whole thing.
I got there in time for dessert.
all this stuff that I saved, that I'm so proud of... just reminds me of my failures.
so... you must be happy about the judgment?
what are you gonna do with all that money?
Oh, it's blood money. My sister's dead. It's...
Meredith, it's a good thing.
haven't you suffered enough?
haven't you?
well, it's just a bruised tailbone.
you can go home now.
and your husband shouldn't be too far behind, just maybe a couple of days.
thank you.
no driving for him, though, for at least a month.
and that goes for sexual activity, too.
uh, and...
so stay off the pole.
you just got back from your honeymoon.
you come talk to me after 45 years of marriage and raising three kids.
you get tired.
you just want to sit in front of the TV and say it's done, it's over.
but you know what?
I'm not doing that.
I'm trying.
at least I'm trying.
she's sorry. She didn't mean to judge.
and the worst part is, he looked embarrassed for me.
I mean, that hurts.
that hurts more than a bruised tailbone.
I mean, I survived 45 years of marriage.
is it so wrong for me to want to celebrate my anniversary with a little sex?
well, is it?
no, it's not. No, no. - It's not.
it's a good idea. - It's not. I said no.
so I'm gonna teach you two how to prefer a monobloc.
wait. - What? No, no, no.
you told me that you were reverting to Mark's.
Yes, but I'm just not comfortable with that.
well, you can't just change your plan in surgery.
I didn't. I spoke with Dana and Phil and Dr. Jovan, the plastics attending who's overseeing me.
Dr. Avery, Mark had a very good reason for wanting to do a simple jaw... - Of course he did.
but Mark is not here anymore.
so I need to do what I think is best for my patient.
so... I'm going to begin by shaving a short strip along the coronal incision instead of cutting off all of his hair.
maybe he can't get it up anymore. Maybe that's why he looked embarrassed.
or maybe, like the woman said, he was just embarrassed for her.
Oh, come on. They're sweet.
you just got back from your honeymoon.
I'd think you of all people would appreciate an older couple with a healthy sex life.
no, I do appreciate a healthy sex life.
it's just...
okay, look, I had sex once on my honeymoon...
one time, the very first night.
we arrived in the Bahamas, and my husband wanted to have sex not in our well-appointed suite, but on the beach.
so off to the beach we went, where we had sex, and I got sand up in my...
cookie.
Yes, a vagina full of sand that gave me a bad, bad infection, requiring a trip to the local doctor, who confirmed the infection and also diagnosed a few sand flea bites on my buttock.
Yeah, his word.
buttock.
he also went on to say that my buttock would become very itchy, and he was right.
so a painful infection and an itchy buttock are what I had on my honeymoon.
so, no, no, I am not a fan of the beach or the pole or anywhere at this point.
I am a fan of a bed.
Oh, that's right.
go on, friend.
laugh.
how's everyone's dinner?
good. - Good.
good. - Good.
Yeah. It's good. - Good.
how'd the surgery with James go?
uh... Jackson didn't listen.
he went ahead with the monobloc readvancement.
Really? How long did that take?
five hours. Yeah.
I stood there, you know, just to make sure he didn't mess it up.
ma'am?
uh, perfect.
okay, very good.
I'd like to make a toast.
Oh, Callie, no toasts.
you know what? Let's just get this dinner over with...
Arizona stood for five hours.
that's not the point.
Yeah, I know.
do you realize how big a deal it is you standing for five hours isn't the point?
do you know what else happened today?
Derek played ping-pong.- And lost.
and wanted to keep on playing 'cause his wrist wasn't sore.
what are you doing?
Oh, sorry. I'm just, uh, quick texting Owen.
sexting.
no, she's trying is what she's doing.
Yeah. You just divorced the guy, and here you are texting him.
mer's right. I'm sexting.
Oh, well, even better.
mark would've loved that.
sex was the thing he loved more than anything else.
don't you see that? We're all trying.
we're trying to move on, which is progress.
and it feels weird... and sad and wrong, but it also feels exciting.
I miss Mark... and Lexie.
and I'm... heartbroken that they're not here tonight.
I'm heartbroken, but...
and I'm gonna celebrate that.
and we are gonna toast.
come on. Toast. Pick up your glasses and toast.
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, she's having champagne.
Grey, we're all having champagne.
no, I can't.
just try. Try.
come on. Just try.
is it too much to ask you to try?
I can't because I'm pregnant.
what?
and I'm happy, so let's celebrate.
Oh, my god. Oh, my goodness.
well, congratulations. Congratulations.
well, cheers. Cheers.
I should've been there, Catherine.
I know.
I failed her.
when she needed me the most, I failed her.
Richard... - No, I...
I feel like I can't grieve.
like I lost the right to grieve when I started seeing you.
but you are grieving, baby.
and you shouldn't have to do it alone.
I would like to just hold your hand.
could you let me do that?
could I just hold your hand?
well, the good news is, the surgery went great.
the bad news is, you're just gonna be another pretty face from now on.
thank you so much.
Yeah, well, Dr. Sloan did most of it. I just took us into the end zone.
Yeah.
you know Jackson told me he thinks James may not even need another major surgery?
Really? Jackson told you that?
did Jackson have his hands on your boobs when he said it?
what are you talking about?
you made fun of me for sleeping with Karev.
called me a skank, made this "I don't wanna be like Leah" thing, and now you're sleeping with the boss.
how'd you know? - Oh, well, I didn't.
now I do. - Everything looks good.
so... you're gonna have to learn how to stand up for yourself.
I know it's not gonna be easy, but... your mom makes me want to eat my hair.
I just found out it was hair.
I don't understand.
it's a condition called trichotillomania.
and it makes you want to pull out your hair and, in some cases, eat it.
so we're gonna set her up with a therapist who's gonna help her to...
no.
here's what's gonna happen... she's just gonna stop, like I did when I stopped eating carbs.
you just decide and that's it.
this is not like you not eating carbs.
it's a medical condition, and... you're gonna take me to see a therapist.
I am... kind of sleeping with Stephanie.
I was hoping that you wouldn't have to find out about it at all.
but of course, it's probably gonna get out.
so I just wanted to make sure that you didn't have to hear about it from anyone else.
okay. - Okay?
I miss you.
I just... I feel like we were friends, and now everything is just so...
so we can still be friends.
you know what I'm thinking about right now?
kissing you.
standing here looking at you, and all I want to do is kiss you.
so, no, I'm... I'm not ready to be your friend yet.
you sure?
Yes. Yes, I'm sure.
thank you for telling me.
okay.
I just checked in on your wife.
medically, she's fine.
otherwise...
your wife is horny, Leonard.
all there is to it.
she wants some sex. She needs it.
is the equipment working, sir?
Yes. Good, good.
then use it.
you're married.
if I were married, I would be doing it all day long.
just... just do it.
slowly. Slowly.
I got you a couch with the money I won.
this is such a girlfriend thing.
okay, I think what you want to say is,"Thank you for the awesome couch."
okay.
but we're not doing it, if that's what you're thinking.
why would we do it? That's disgusting. You're like my brother.
we drink beer and hang out.
okay.
I mean... I've never really had a friend who was a girl who didn't want to do it so it's weird.
except Mer, and she probably wanted me at some point.
you really are a douche.
just shut up and drink.
hunt, come over here.
I can't.- I... it's not your fault.
I know that. We're moving forward.
just please come over here and have a drink.
shepherd, I... - Cristina.
tell your husband to come over here and have a drink.
no, no. He's not my husband.
I mean, I don't know what you are.
I mean, I don't know what we are, but...
you know, it doesn't matter.
all that matters now is that I'm drunk and happy and I want you to be here drunk and happy with me.
plus the bathrooms lock, so...
whatever you're doing, just...
let somebody else do it and come on over and have a drink.
they say ignorance is bliss.
another time.
enjoy your party.
because once you know about the tumor or the prognosis, you can't go back.
so where are we at?
the insurance company found a loophole.
apparently there's a rule that no more than two attendings are allowed on a medi plane.
so when Dr. Robbins took Dr. Karev's place on the flight...
anyway, they say they aren't gonna pay.
okay, so who pays?
we do.
the hospital.
we don't have that kind of reserve.
no, we don't.
so?
we go bankrupt.
the hospital closes its doors.
will you be strong or will you fall apart?
it's hard to predict.
so don't worry about it.
enjoy the time you have before the news comes.
they've installed cameras.
they're all over the C. C.U.
next they'll be in the O. R.s, the hallways, the on-call rooms.
we're being spied on, Mer.
who knows what evil lurks behind that electronic eye?
morning, Dr. Yang.
big Brother knows my name.
big Brother can see your name tag.
excuse me.
the cameras are not here to spy on you. They are here to supplement you.
on the other side of the camera is a remote physician,
we've all heard the buzz words...
Streamline, optimize, integrate, adapt.
every day someone comes up with a new strategy or tool or technology to increase our efficiency.
the idea is to make our lives easier.
but the question is, does it?
and of course, ultimately reduce costly litigation.
so does that answer your questions?
with disturbing clarity.
all right.
let's move on then.
as you can see, this O. R. has been arranged with maximum efficiency, specifically for O. R. turnover.
now what are the main causes for bottleneck?
the layout of O. R. supplies, equipment, and instruments.
so what we have done here... - What did we miss?
O. R.s are sloppy. - There are doctors in the ceilings.
what? What do... what does that even mean?
we'd know if you'd just put her stupid tights on her.
I was talking her into it, okay? She was getting on board.
um, she's 2. At a certain point, she doesn't have to get on board. She has to be in day care.
so you pick her up and you yank her tights on her.
that's what you do. And then she cries.
Yeah, because you wasted all that time cajoling her, so now I have to be the bad cop.
if you just made it clear in the first place that she has no choice...
because when every second counts, you need the most efficient approach.
what she said.
it's about new hospital procedures, and we weren't invited.
thank god. It looks boring.
don't you guys get what's going on?
Yeah, they're closing the E. R. and streamlining the place.
it sucks, but... - They're gonna fire us.
why bother teaching us the new protocols if we're gonna be gone anyway?
you're crazy.
it's not that bad. Is it?
look at this.
nurses are stockpiling.
the end is coming.
your average time between surgeries is 37 minutes.
with these new O. R. procedures, I'd like to see that cut in half.
thank you, everyone.
closing the E. R. should cut down on time.
we won't have any patients.
how's Hunt feel about that?
Oh, he says he's not gonna do anything about it until it actually happens.
Oh, it's happening.
and he can't be a trauma surgeon without an E. R. Is he gonna leave town?
cause if you go with him, I'm screwed.
I'm kind of depending on your rent check.
way to make this all about you.
the E. R. is not going to close.
Derek has a plan.
where is Derek?
he spent the night with Kepner.
it's gonna work, right?
of course. See,'cause derm cuts a fellow, and then cardio skips the TED conference, plastic/ortho shares, uh, lab facilities, we'll get a little bit here, a little bit there.
and we'll have enough saved to keep the E. R. alive.
Oh, there gonna be mad about the TED conference.
Oh, they're gonna be pissed about everything, but that's okay. It's gonna work.
do we have a reply yet?
uh, no, not yet.
that was the subject line?
Wh-wh-wh, is that bad?
well, would you open any that said "Proposed budget cuts"?
Oh, no. Did I just kill our proposal?
no. We're just gonna have to pitch it in person.
go door to door, which is better anyway.
it's hard to say no to someone's face.
no offense, sir.
you have an unusually appealing face, but...
I have to brush my tee. I know. You do, too.
standardizing an O. R. is one thing, but that's not going to make much difference if we don't standardize what happens in the O. R. To that end,I have brought in Dr. Darrell Nesbaum to show us how it can be done.
everything will be scanned...- When did you become such a kiss-ass?
the last five hospitals whose efficiency she improved ended up cutting their staff by 30%.
I'll learn to rope cattle if it means keeping my job.
well, I'm safe because they can't fire the pregnant lady.
can they?
uh, Dr. Nesbaum, you can take it from here.
of course.
good morning, everybody.
now I have just one question before we begin.
are you ready to rock some hernias?
that's what I'm talkin' about.
has she moved yet?
what do you think?
is her mom here?
cause she's nicer when her mom's here.
no, she had to leave for work.
you sure the kid didn't eat her?
you guys, stop.
she's angry. She's 13 and she had a double hip replacement. You'd be angry, too.
she's mean. - Like a badger.
she's three days post-op now. Okay?
if she doesn't move her hips, we're looking at clots, contractures, poor recovery.
we just have to make her do it for her own good.
look who I'm talking to.
can't even put a toddler in tights.
GR... well, then you just... you show me how a bad cop does it.
Karev, get in there.
why me? - We're attendings. You're a fellow.
it's an order.
that's how a bad cop does it.
Dr. Hunt, I sent contractors to measure the E. R. space.
Yeah, and I told them to get lost.
I know. That's why we're talking.
the E. R. is open for one more day.
uh, Dr. Hunt, the E. R. is closing.
I know you don't want it to, but you're gonna need to let that go.
while we are treating patients, I don't want your workmen in the way.
we are on a tight schedule with the renovation.
I was hoping that you would cooperate.
Yeah, well, you're gonna need to let that go.
I'd just like to hear you name one thing that you can put in there - that's more useful than an E. R. - It's still under review, but...
in the army, the guys at the front get the most saves. Why?
because the closer you are to the moment of injury, the better chance you have to help.
that is what an E. R. is.
where are we going?
roof. Medevac's coming.
uh, I shouldn't.
I should hop off now...
emergency medicine is the front line.
we're the first responder.
we're closest.
it's the most important thing that a hospital does. - It's arguably...
so name me one thing that you would replace it with that matters more.
you've made your point.
now if you don't mind, I have a big day, and I...
40-year-old male logger versus chain saw.
deep neck laceration affecting most of the major blood vessels and extending into the chest.
he's hypotensive and tachycardic.
Oh, and his nose is pretty much sliced off.
how's his airway?
intact. It was never stridorous. Did not appear to involve the trachea.
I got it. I got it. It's the carotid.
I have it. I got it. I was closest.
okay, everything appears stable.
let's redress the nose.
page plastics.
right away. - Gown me. Work around Dr. Cahill.
and see who else is available.
I'll check.
keep holding pressure.
as soon as I find another surgeon, I'll take over and I'll get you out of there.
no, I got it.
having one person control the carotid limits his chance of stroking out.
all right. Gown her, too. - Right away.
start with Russell.
you want to do the opener or me?
well, the numbers are so compelling.
I think I'd start with how much his department's cuts will save the hospital.
and then I would...-I'll do the opener.
sorry. I get a little excited about statistics.
not everybody shares that passion.
not everybody.
okay, so you do the talking, and I'll hold up the chart when you give me the signal?
perfect.
Oh, damn it.
hunt needs me in the O. R. You're gonna have to start without me.
no. People don't like me.
talk from your heart, not about the charts or the numbers.
you can do this.
and there you have it.
a technique I have developed through years of highly focused research.
I eat, sleep, and breathe hernias, folks.
after today, something tells me you will, too.
gross.
Dr. Nesbaum. Over the years, I've developed my own technique for a hernia repair.
so if it's all the same to you, I'll stick to that.
I'm sure it's lovely, but the point here is to standardize the way Seattle Grace Mercy West approaches the hernia so every O. R. can be prepped the same way.
it's quick, clean, efficient.
I suppose.
listen to old man Webber,"My ways are the best ways."
Ooh, it's drafty in here. Somebody bring me a blanket.
now what do you say to a little friendly competition, hmm?
the first surgeon who can perform 20 hernia repairs using my exact tension-free mesh technique will win bragging rights, the respect of their peers, and aha...
this sweet baby.
I've seen those in the gift shop.
they're not cheap.
I knew it. They're making us fight to survive.
first prize is a fleece.
second prize is a one-way ticket to the curb.
shall we begin?
tributes, may the odds be ever in your favor.
take 'em off.
what?
well, we gotta get you up and moving.
today's the day.
maybe tomorrow's the day.
look, if you don't get up, your hips aren't gonna heal right.
I don't care.
I know it's hard.
but you're only 13.
you talk like your whole life is over.
like you even know what my life was.
I know that you were into gymnastics.
I wasn't "Into gymnastics," stupid.
it was my career.
ever since I was 4 years old, it's all I've ever wanted to do.
my mom worked double shifts so I could be in the gym five hours a day.
more on the weekends.
and I knew that if I worked really hard, someday she wouldn't have to anymore.
I ranked number one at the future stars nationals last year.
I was going to the Rio Olympics.
I was next.
when my hips started to hurt, I thought that I pulled a muscle, so I trained through it.
I'm not next anymore.
I'm nothing. I'm number zero.
no, you're not.
maybe this part might be over, but you got time to do all sorts of things.
they said that if the surgery was successful, I might be able to ride a bike, 'cause that's as good as having your face on a slurpee cup, right?
you might understand if... you've ever been great at something... been best at something.
so, yeah, my life is over at 13.
I get to ride a bike and go to school and wait to die.
Dr. Yang, about the I. V. heparin you ordered for room three.
is there a problem?
no. It's just Dr. Richardson insists I give Sub-Q Enoxaparin.
who the hell is Dr. Richardson?
Oh, yeah. Ignore it. - I tried.
he keeps insisting, and it's really upsetting the patient.
open the pod bay doors, Hal.
it's Bob Richardson. Dr. Richardson.
I have a little problem, Bob.
I'm here to help.
you're supposed to be our eyes in the sky, correct?
Yes. - Then how about you just do that?
I'm sorry?
don't question my medical decisions.
if I order my intern to give I. V. Heparin, I want I. V. Heparin.
uh, I guess you haven't read the results from the SYNERGY trial, which showed Enoxaparin reduced the need for monitoring.
got a lot of time to read, Bob, hanging out in your underwear, watching your wall of monitors?
cause that same trial found that there was more bleeding...
Dr. Yang. The pit's calling with a possible cardiac trauma in the field.
five minutes away.
don't try and be a doctor, Bob.
just make sure my idiot interns don't screw up.
give the I. V. Heparin. Don't butt in. Let's go.
Dr. Russell. Dr. Kepner, trauma.
trauma, of sainted memory.
actually, um, we're trying to save the department,
I was wondering if could talk to you about some ideas.
got your e-mail.
proposed budget cuts." Nice try."
well, I think you'll see that a 2%... Okay, uh, numbers don't really matter. I,um...
ever been to a TED conference? - I haven't.
inspiring.
finest minds of our generation under one roof, sharing stories of mind-bending innovation.
that sounds great but... - Innovation is what's gonna save this hospital...
okay. - Not this penny saved, penny earned crap.
okay, but, um... - Good to meet you, Dr. Kepler.
Kepner.
this is a mess.
I don't think we can fix this primarily.
can you check for back bleeding?
Cahill? - Me?
Yeah, you're holding the clamp.
if you can't do it, then...
okay.
he doesn't have any.
okay. Which means he has poor collateral flow.
we're gonna need a shunt.
I can put it in if someone will get me a rummel tourniquet.
thank you.
sorry. I used to do that.
it's like riding a bike, huh?
Yeah, if the bike's going 200 miles an hour.
that's what makes it fun.
Yeah, damn right, it does.
so why did you stop in the first place?
Yeah, Hunt, I got your page.
you're worried about a brain bleed?
Yeah, we didn't get a chance to do the scan. His carotid blew.
is that Kepner?
Cahill.
Dr. Shepherd, hi.
so instead of telling us how to do our jobs, now you're just doing them?
that would be more efficient.
no, she was in the right place at the right time.
she probably saved his life.
I got lucky.
lucky for this guy his chain saw slipped today.
tomorrow he'd be dead already.
what do you got? - Skateboarder versus car.
late teens.
didn't have I. D. The kid was slaloming hills with a buddy.
was nonresponsive in the field.
his last systolic was 70.
heart rate tacking along in the 130s.
E. K.G. shows some changes, so I suspect cardiac trauma.
okay, I need a portable X-ray up here, stat.
I need a 12-lead, and, uh, let's get a T. E.E. bedside.- Right away.
ready on three. One, two, three.
Murphy, set up the T. E.E. - Got it.
type and cross for six units.
hang two units of O-neg as soon as possible.
Hey, what's your buddy's name?
does he have any allergies that you know of?
is he on any medications?
I don't know.
look, is he going to be okay?
we're doing everything we can.
no breath sounds on the right.
someone set up a chest tube. - On it.
it looks like a mediastinal hematoma.
could be an aortic transection.
uh, we need to move fast, people.
B. P.'s still dropping.
scissors.
Yeah, he's crashing.
where is that blood?
right here, doctor.
Oh, he has a medical I. D. It must have broken off.
okay. What's it say? What's he allergic to?
Oh, god. - What is he allergic to?
okay, stop.
he's a Jehovah's witness.
we can't give him blood.
they're prepping the O. R. for a bloodless surgery so we'll need to recirculate his blood.
so we'll put him on a cell saver machine, and then continue the hypertonic saline, colloids, and factor VII to pump up his intravascular volume.
we're seriously repairing an aortic transection without blood?
Yeah, we have no choice.
we could use blood.
Oh, we could also be arrested for assault and battery.
very funny. - I'm not joking.
there are protocols in place for people who won't or can't accept supplemental blood.
we do bloodless surgeries here all the time.
have you ever done this... a bloodless aortic transection?
no.
I hear you.
you don't have her walking yet?
Oh, there's no talking to that girl.
it's dark in there.
really dark.
Karev... - I'm serious.
that girl turned me into a suicide risk.
I'm gonna move her myself then.
excessive force... bad cop's go-to move.
you know what makes a bad cop bad?
when the good cop's namby-pamby approach gets us nowhere.
then bad cop has to set a limit and ends up looking like a big meanie.
a good cop's approach takes time and patience.
bad cop is a notorious hothead.
if she's going to insist on wearing dresses, she has to wear tights.
I'm gonna go lie down.
his vitals are worse.
how's the cell saver coming?
almost ready.
do we have surgical glue? - Yes.
Avitene? - Yes.
okay, I want two bovies set up. - I'm on it.
joy, get my headlamp ready.
here it is.
wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where is my gel foam and thrombin?
we're trying to keep blood loss to a minimum.
we need a whole bunch more.
okay, hypertonic saline?
check. Factor VII? Check.
cell saver ready?
check.
okay, let's go before he bleeds out.
I can't cut.
he'll lose too much blood.
what do we do?
we'll go in percutaneously.
get the O. R. ready for an endovascular repair.
let's move.
excellent, Dr. Grey.
19 more to go.
you're gonna choke, Grey.
you'll choke and die, and I will dance and sing.
damn it.
damn it!
the mesh is bunching up at the pubic tubercle.
you know, I still feel that you do not...
I understand this can be tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll see why a dozen hospitals around the country have already adopted this approach, and I've already had inquiries from a dozen more.
check!
excuse me.
okay. All right. That's the right idea.
but, um...- But-but what?
well... Check. Check! Check!
Hey, don't beat around the bush.
tell me what you don't like,'cause it looks perfect to me.
okay.
take a look at what Dr. Grey is doing over here.
you see how she doesn't rush, cut the mesh just right?
see, now when done properly, the mesh will fit perfectly and not require extra sutures to hold it, thereby reducing the risk of future complications.
so do this over, pay attention to the details, and take your time.
I would be happy to give you some pointers if you'd like.
that bun in the oven may give you job security, Meredith Grey, but it does not make you immune from a smack in the mouth.
rich is still in surgery.
uh, Dr. Yang sent me down to talk to his family.
well, how-how's he doing?
it's touch and go.
they're gonna take him back up to the C. C.U. Is his family here?
dude, like... dozens of them.
you know, I swear, we hung out practically every day.
we have the same shift at the skate shop.
and he never once mentioned to me that he was a Jehovah's witness.
he never talked about it.
I kind of don't think he is.
well, maybe it was just a personal thing.
maybe, but I mean, if you... if you believed in something so hard that you would die for it...
would you keep it a secret?
wouldn't you at least tell your friends?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
I should... look, I gotta... I gotta get out of here.
will you... will you call me when he's out?
sure. No problem.
with which we ourselves are being comforted by now.
blessed be the god and father of our lord Jesus Christ.
we can't repair the carotid under tension.
it'll pull apart. - Or clot. It's tricky.
we can't use one of these vessels to patch it.
the chain saw chewed everything up pretty good.
I could take a piece of saphenous vein from the leg...
Yes. Good. Good. Go ahead.
prep the leg.
all right. Scissors and betadine, please.
right away, doctor.
so I hear somebody's nose came off?
can I have a headlamp, please?
almost. Take a look.
well, I would if we could find out Where we're keeping the headlamps these days.
and what should've shaved off half a second has now added five.
thank you.
gauze, please. - Oh, sorry.
meant to just say "Gauze."
that "Please" just cost me a tenth of second.
all right, Avery. That's enough.
chief, you know this is all about turning over the tables for her.
I mean, I feel like I'm working the dinner shift at a jumbo burger in here.
Dr. Avery... - She should just replace us with surgical robots, really.
I mean, that's essentially what she's asking us to be.
bless you.
you don't tell us how to run an O. R. if you don't actually work in one.
that's all I'm saying.
you can tell Dr. Pantsuit hasn't been in one in years.
until today.
well... I can repair this post-op.
so just give me a shout when you're done.
thank you... doctors.
best of luck.
I thought I was gonna be fired.
sorry about that.
Oh, it's fine.
it's easier if there's a bad guy.
my people just care about this place.
I know. I know you're all upset, especially you, losing your E. R.
but I also know that without me, you'd lose this entire hospital.
so if you need to blame me instead of thank me,
I'm fine with that, because I will know who saved it.
I've saved a dozen before just like this one, and no one thanked me for those either.
let's add a C. P.K. to his next blood draw.
what was his last hemoglobin?
4. The guy's on fumes.
try and stimulate blood production by giving E. P.O.
or we could... give him blood and cut out the middle man.
we can also give I. V. Iron-dextran.
Thanks, Bob.
we can give him iron? How is that logical?
we can give him the components of blood, just not blood?
we have to respect his wishes.
what wishes? He can't tell us anything.
his friend didn't even know that he was a Jehovah's witness.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you talk about at the skate park.
I'm just saying, he's 19.
how can he even know what he believes?
when I was 19, I was a completely different person than I am now.
I wanted to be a radiologist.
I feel like I'm seeing a whole new you.
uh, start his E. P.O. and keep a close eye on his crit.
right away, doctor.
so you're fine with this?
even though he could die, you're fine with just...
it doesn't matter what I think.
he had an alert. It was very clear... no blood.
I don't get to have an opinion about it, and neither do you.
so there's nothing we can do?
Yeah, there is.
we can talk to the family.
good luck.
Simmi, I need you to take my hand. I'm gonna help you sit up.
you're gonna swing your legs to the side and you're gonna stand up. Now.
I don't give you permission to touch me...
like, bodily. I'll scream.
Simmi, if you don't move,
I'm gonna have to say that you're acting against medical advice.
we will discharge you, you will go home, and you will rot, okay?
the muscles around your new hips will atrophy, and you will probably never walk again.
why do you care?
because I'm your doctor and I worked very hard to help you.
wouldn't it suck if you didn't help me?
if you went through all of that training to become a big doctor, you came up with a plan, you did my operation, you did it just right, just perfect, you made me so I could walk again, but I didn't, wouldn't you feel helpless, like nothing matters?
no matter how much you care, how hard you try, how badly you want something, you will never have it...
because everything is totally out of your control.
feel that?
couldn't have done it better myself.
Yes! - Yes, indeed.
okay, all right, people often ask me how I can focus so much time on hernias and maintain this level of excitement.
well, now you see... perfection is exciting.
Yeah.
hear that, Grey? I'm perfect.
Oh, look at miss slow and steady over there.
can't even bother to participate.
no, seriously, Grey, you okay?
um, yeah, yeah. I just need to...
damn it.
something's wrong. Something's wrong.
you're right. I got comfortable and flip, and the universe is smacking me down for it.
I'm not immune. I'm not safe.
wait, wait. Grey, stop. What is going on?
there's a flutter. It's... it can't be right.
Oh, sweetie. This is not a bad thing.
what? It's not?
Oh, no, it's good. It's so good.
your baby's kicking.
he's lost a lot of blood. I'd say more than half his volume.
he'll make new blood.
it takes about four days to make new blood cells.
he may not have that much time.
what would really help is a blood transfusion.
no. No blood.
if you're worried about disease transmission,
I can assure you that all of our blood is meticulously screened.
it's not that we don't trust your blood. We just...
we believe that life is a gift from god and we don't try to sustain it by taking in blood.
let me be perfectly clear, your son's condition is critical.
without blood, his organs will start shutting down.
and once he starts that spiral, there is nothing we can do.
Oh, dear god.
we are juggling all kinds of substitute measures, but nothing is as good as blood.
as his surgeon, I urge you to let us give him the best chance we can.
let us give him blood.
we have seen amazing miracles through prayer.
if it's god's will...
so you won't allow blood, even if it's gonna save his life?
cause prayer... - Murphy.
we appreciate all you're doing for our boy.
but your blood wouldn't save his life. It would condemn him.
living with it would be so much worse for him than dying without it.
we understand.
we will do everything in our power to keep your son alive.
thank you.
colvin said I was insulting him and everyone in his field.
said she doesn't talk to fundraisers.
and Springfield basically had me agreeing to give him money.
and then Russell... - You talked about the numbers?
no. - April.
I... didn't. I mean, just... a ti... like barely at all.
we don't have a lot of time, but I'll see what I can do.
Oh, there's Redmond.
I saw your little Howie today when I was dropping Zola off at day care. Man, he's cute.
Ah, thanks. Yeah, he's a kick.
Yeah, Zola's at that age where she's just putting everything in her mouth.
Yeah, we're not quite there yet.
Oh, just you wait. It's like, legos, magnets.
Really? Jeez. - Anything that is a choking hazard, they find it.
Yeah, well, lucky for us, the E. R. is right downstairs from the, uh, day care.
Yeah, that's for sure.
wait, isn't that closing?
Yeah, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Dermatology has two fellows.
now if we could just cut one of them... maybe we could possibly...
I hate her. - Who?
my intern. - Why?
look at her, all mopey-faced just 'cause she didn't get her way.
we were never mopey-faced. We sucked it up.
why aren't you in your skills lab?
Oh, because the baby kicked. Wouldn't stop kicking, actually.
jerk. - No, it's good.
it's great. Kicking is a good thing.
maybe I should kick my intern.
maybe my baby's kicking because it wants a granola bar.
that's possible.
you want to stop right there.
you tried to give blood instead of fluids?
he's not stupid, you know, the eyeball?
he has eyes. - And a zoom lens.
rich is circling the drain, and he doesn't have to be.
we are giving him everything we have, just like the family requested.
Yeah, I know. And they're praying. Awesome.
you never administer anything to a patient without my orders.
you think that because you've been here all of, what, six months, you know everything? You know nothing.
on the timeline of doctoring, you are an amoeba.
I thought that he deserved a chance.
you have passion. I get it.
you still have to do what I say.
I am your boss and I am trying to save this patient's life.
now get out of here. You're off my service.
I just... - Now.
I'm sorry.
what are you gonna do, get her fired?
she didn't do anything.
there's nothing to tell.
she's right, you know? He's circling the drain.
Yeah, I know.
okay. Ready?
fingers crossed.
Yes. The sutures will hold.
there will be no bloodbath.
okay, let's go, doctor. Remove your clamps.
Dr. Cahill?
okay. Okay, good.
I totally wasn't sure that was gonna work.
I get it. I get it. But you did great.
I'd never have thought you'd spent a day outside of an O. R.
Oh, thank you very much.
Oh, good god. I have to go. I've lost a whole day.
you're all right if I... - No, no, we're not done.
but it's pretty straightforward... - No, we need to finish debriding.
we need to put in drains, close, then you get to tell the family that you saved him, he's alive because of you.
and then they get to thank you.
and that's the best part.
10-blade, please.
I'm saying, they always cut the lowest on the totem pole first.
and we're below that.
I've been emptying urine bags all morning.
you gotta stop.
all these cuts, the reconfiguring, this is designed to make the hospital run more efficiently in the future.
so?
that means Cahill is planning for the hospital to have a future.
if you're gonna have a hospital, there's one thing you can't cut.
doctors.
crap. My patient's coding.
see that? We save lives, people.
we are smart, young, vital doctors.
you're right. If she's planning for the future...
we are that future.
Oh, you hope.
cause you can talk all you want and work hard, hustle, you can empty more urine bags than the next guy.
the future, kids, is completely out of your control.
Jeff. How's the research coming?
save it. Your sidekick already made the pitch. Not gonna happen.
Oh, come on. Your team can watch the TED talks online.
it's not about the talks. It's about the networking. The real conf...
this isn't about me. This is what's good for the hospital.
everyone can benefit from the E. R.the patients especially.
you know what might open my heart to your cause?
your parking space.
my space is right next to yours. Uh, it's not even an advantage.
in fact, you're 5 feet further from the door.
I don't want to swap. I want 'em both.
I don't want you dinging my doors. - What?
I want both spots So I can park in the middle.
how's your sister, Jeff?
Really? Really?
you're really gonna go there?
well, I'll never forget how grateful you were when I clipped her aneurysm.
and you said,"If there's anything I can ever do for you..."
this is just plain bullying.
say good-bye to TED, Jeff.
I still want your parking space.
may as well swallow your poison berries now, Webber, because I am the girl. who's on fire.
check.
very good, Dr. Webber.
Oh, let's just, um...
I'm confused. Where's the mesh?
Oh, I didn't use any.
I wanted to give you a look at the Webber method so you can see just what you're missing.
it's lovely, but...
isn't it? See, when I use the relaxing incision to oppose the tissue without tension,
I achieve the same result without the use of mesh.
but this method will no longer be performed at Seattle Grace.
the method we learned today is the accepted method for open primary repairs hospital-wide.
because we're cogs in an assembly line, churning out product over and over, standardized across the country.
don't you think every patient deserves the same standard of care?
and how good can that care be when we see 50 patients in a day?
what are their names? Who are their families?
with that kind of volume, who in the hell knows?
as long as you can slap a sign on the door that says, "Over ten million served," who the hell cares?
you're missing the point. The patients don't matter.
what matters is...
I didn't... Obviously, I didn't mean that. Okay?
we are only concerned about hernias, right now, I mean.
see, that... that is really quite good.
in the months to come, I think everyone should follow your lead, okay? Okay.
keep it up.
still in V-fib. How long has it been? - 26 minutes.
push another epi and, uh, charge again to 200.
charging.
clear.
still nothing. - Damn it.
uh... charge to 200 again. Clear.
okay, I'm calling it.
time of death... 6: 42.
he didn't have to die.
all they had to do was let us give him blood.
and he still could've died.
the C. C.U. is full of people we pump full of blood, and they still die. People die.
you know, what you did was wrong in about a hundred different ways.
and I plan on telling you all of them, just not right now.
cause right now, I have to go talk to the family.
Hey, show's over, Bob. You can change the channel.
how'd it go?
Oh, for god sakes. I mean, s...
okay, see, officer hard-ass? Your approach doesn't always work either.
you need to get up now.
you need to take a few steps and remember how it feels.
and I know... I know how hard this is.
but you want this. You do.
you don't know what I want.
no? Okay.
I lost my leg... less than a year ago.
and I was scared and in pain and I thought that I would never be able to do the things that I like to do anymore.
but I did. I operated on you.
they send the cripple in to teach me how to live my life.
okay. Okay. You know what?
you can be scared and you can be pissed and you can lie here like a garden slug till you die for all I care.
but you will not, not, become a monster that takes everyone else down with them.
you will treat people with kindness and respect.
and you will start with yourself.
and you will start by standing up.
and you will do so by the time I count to three, or I will drag your ass out of this bed.
so one... two... three. Okay.
you got it. You got it. You got it.
okay. Okay, I got you. I got you. All right.
good. Good. Good. Good.
take a step.
great. - Look at that. You got it.
good. Good job.
all right. Look at you.
Oh, my... he's gonna live?
thank you.
this is who you really should be thanking. If it wasn't for her...
thank you. Thank you so much! God bless you. Thank you.
hold the elevator, please!
off to celebrate, are we?
I get it.
well, change can be rough.
but once you get used to it, you'll never believe you did a hernia repair any other way.
and if I may say, that sweatshirt is quite becoming on you.
it's itchy.
I did forget what a rush it is.
uh, yeah. What, saving someone's life? Yeah, it's not bad.
you know, we could do that again tomorrow if we had an E. R.
we figured it out. We can save the E. R.
we got each department to make some cuts, and I'm gonna have to park in Tacoma, but it is going to work.
I'm sorry. You misunderstood.
no amount of budget cutting or shuffling is gonna save your E. R.
or your hospital, for that matter.
you're getting us ready to sell.
what?
a buyer is going to save your hospital. I just need to make it presentable.
I'm sorry. What? It's...
you're staging it, like a house.
exactly. And the E. R. is like the shag carpet.
it's gotta go.
sorry.
I had a wonderful time today.
to really be efficient...
you have to eliminate what doesn't work.
you have to figure out what's important...
what are you gonna do?
you mean right now or...
or both. Whichever.
right now I am going to drink a lot.
that's all I know.
can I buy the first one? - Yeah.
and hold on tight...
to the things that matter most.
Oh, I felt that.
wait.
Oh, you got a soccer player, I think, right there.
to a critically ill patient, an organ transplant means a new start, a second chance.
but the body is designed to fight off any outside invader, even one that's trying to save it.
jackson Avery really has a bigger say than any of us in running this hospital?
that can't be true. Can it?
well, he's a voting member of the management team and he also represents the Harper Avery foundation.
and their 175 million bucks.
as opposed to our $15 million apiece.
according to Stan, not only does he have the deciding vote, he can veto ours.
because a transplant doesn't guarantee that it's an easier life.
that is ridiculous.
he's a fellow.
so are you.
but he's a plastics fellow.
and I'm me.
well, let's not overreact.
I mean, it's Jackson. He's not some corporate stranger. He's one of us.
no, you're right. He's a smart kid. He's gonna follow our lead.
no. No. We made this plan.
we pulled it together.
look, I'm grateful to Harper Avery for an infusion of cash, but I'm-I'm not gonna let some-some...
plastics fellow?
plastics fellow tell me how to run my service 'cause his mommy said he could.
preach.
there's a threat that the body will reject the organ outright.
it was your idea.
it was pillow talk.
and suddenly, it's a business plan.
you were all for it at the time.
you investing in the hospital, sure.
anointing your son boy king?
what on earth makes you think that young man's prepared to take on this kind of responsibility?
he's my son. I know what he's capable of.
and he's my student. I do, too.
you know, actually, I should revise that.
now he's my boss, and my girlfriend is my boss' boss.
what could possibly go wrong?
you are forgetting who you're dating, Richard.
I'm the chairman of the board of a large foundation.
I have made an extremely savvy investment.
and I will manage my investment as I see prudent.
I've placed at the top of the organization an individual that is energetic, motivated, and responsive.
there's only one room in which I take orders from my boyfriend.
this is not it.
good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
good morning.
shall we?
okay, so we're agreed that the peds and adult E. R.s will be combined to save on personnel?
Yeah. - I'm sorry, guys.
I was running on time, and then my last rounds' patient turned into a crier.
uh, we were discussing the reopening of the E. R. and the trauma department.
Oh, yes. Um, I'm not ready for that just yet.
if you need more time with the material, we can go ahead...- No, no, I've-I've read it.
uh, it's just that the foundation feels like the E. R. is not a forgone conclusion.
they need a site visit, a chance to look over the numbers.
it could be a month before a decision.
okay. The foundation knows we plan on getting our level-I trauma designation back, right?
they know that's the idea, yeah.
uh, it's the fact.
I think we should table this until we can bring in Owen.
uh, he'll have a lot of thoughts on this, too.
Yeah...- that's-that's the other thing.
what thing?
okay.
since we are starting fresh, the thought is that new leadership would be good for morale.
what, like, uh, chief of surgery?
Oh, no way.
firing Owen?
okay, we're not firing Owen.
okay, well, the foundation thinks that... - Your mother.
the Harper Avery foundation... - Your mother, Avery. Just say it.
it's a recommendation.
it's an inappropriate one.
Oh, tell your mom that.
this is bull... - And this is going nowhere.
I have surgery. - Yeah. Me, too.
we should get back to this.
you know, I don't care who's giving you your marching orders, this thing with Owen is not happening.
well, say what you want, but without the Harper Avery foundation, none of us are here.
and we appreciate that.
but no one expected them to come in and start dictating policy.
Yeah, well, no one asked you to sue the hospital into bankruptcy either.
for the plane crash that killed Lexie?
if we put Kepner's donor to O. R. 1, that moves Bailey's hernia to O. R. 5.
Robbins is in 5. - Okay, 6.
we don't have enough nurses to staff 6.
I thought you said you were getting them back.
I'm trying. Some of them are bitchier than I am.
chief. - Yeah.
u. N. O. S. just called.
they got a kidney that's a match for Jaelynn Donovan.
Yeah, we have no room today, Karev.
no O. R. staff.
half the nurses have quit, including the transplant coordinator.
you may need to decline this one.
this girl's 16. She's been on dialysis for 3 years.
okay. All right. Well, we'll figure it out, okay?
okay, so... - Owen.
uh, just a second.
Owen, they're talking about replacing you.
Ruth, excuse us, please.
what? W-why? Who is?
but we're not gonna let that happen.
I just didn't want you to hear a rumor and think I didn't tell...
Dr. Yang, it's U. N. O. S. They have a heart and lungs.
I'm gonna talk to Catherine Avery.
you're not gonna do anything.
I am. Take your call.
Dr. Yang here.
Bradley Parker, 31 years old, end-stage A. L. S.
uh, trach-dependent. Had a lap-chole three weeks ago.
now presents with a chief complaint of hematochezia.
he actually used the word "Hematochezia."
Yeah, he was an internal medicine resident at Mercy West while I was there.
he did a residency with A. L. S?
he was diagnosed second year and worked till he couldn't anymore.
he's an amazing guy.
is that coming from...
Hey, could you turn that down?
Hey, guys. What the hell is going on here?
this is a hospital.
there are very sick people here.
that includes you, too, Brad.
okay, everyone out. Let's go. Out. Come on.
it's all right.
I invited them.
well, Dr. Edwards and I need to discuss your next steps.
so maybe if everyone could leave... - I already know my next step.
I'm donating my organs.
we do organ donation after a patient's brain dead.
you're nowhere close to brain dead.
I'm doing... - Mom.
he's doing D. C. D.
uh, donation after cardiac death.
he can give if his heart stops.
I'm being kept alive by this vent.
once we disconnect it... Booyah.
chief Hunt signed off.
welcome to my funeral.
Avery... Am I in or out?
what? That's...
word is I might be out of a job, so I'd like to hear it from you.
Yeah, there was a thought that a change in leadership could be good for staff morale.
Oh, for morale?
I've been killing myself to keep morale up for the past three weeks, to keep this place open.
and no one is saying that you haven't...
nobody's saying anything.
I've been shut out of every decision that you people make.
and now I hear this?
all right. Calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down!
guys, guys, guys.
let's take this somewhere else.
Oh, this is coming from you, too?
you're all just talking about a new chief?
no. No. It was brought up, and we tabled it.
Oh, you tabled it?
you shouldn't even be talking about it.
listen, this is a decision that we have... - Avery, enough.
I'm just trying to explain... - Avery, go!
you know as well as I do there are politics here.
we're trying to find our way.
just sit tight.
I am through sitting tight.
I am through looking like an idiot while you all lie to me.
no, we're not lying to you.
Oh, when you said that we were in this together, I thanked you, and then one hour later, you quit.
you're a liar.
no, no, no, no.
you lied to the staff.
we are doing the best we can.
and then I'm this poor sucker running around trying to fix this mess that you all made!
you don't! You do not want to get into whose responsibility this is.
you don't want to get into who's responsible for all of this.
you don't!
well, I can make this decision easier for you.
I quit.
Owen, what happened?
did you get the heart and the lungs?
I... yes.
that's great.
talk to me.
nothing happened, I'm just... I'm done.
I should've been done a long time ago.
okay, what are you talking about?
shepherd is right.
this is all on me.
no one blames you.
well, somebody does.
and as long as that's true, I... I don't see how I can be effective here.
depending on when the organs come in, you might need to adjust the O. R. board, move things off until tomorrow.
sweetheart. Owen...
not the same.
surgeons save lives.
you just catch it when it falls out of someone.
O. B.s do surgery.
if a baby is not coming out...
I go in, and I get it.
it's not the same.
Oh, plus every patient that I have is two patients in one.
so beat that.
you wear pink scrubs.
Yeah.
Yeah, you win.
I have no response for that.
you really pull it off, though.
Oh, thank you.
Alex, do you know Jason?
Yeah, chest peckwell. - Jason Myers.
have you seen where Jaelynn Donovan's parents are?
isn't Jaelynn up in dialysis?
I know where she is. I asked about her parents.
excuse me. Are you getting on or what?
I'll take the stairs.
turn to page six, everyone, the... - Dr. Avery, could you...
Oh, come on in, sweetheart.
we're just going over the purchase agreement you'll be signing tonight.
I'm sure you've read through them.
can I speak with you outside for just a moment?
of course. Excuse me.
no, I did not read through them, as I couldn't possibly read through them as they are not in english.
I understand.
I am not a lawyer and I am not an accountant.
stop. Breathe.
nobody understands those documents.
that's why these smart people are here to explain them to us.
all you have to do is hear what they have to say.
ask a couple of questions, and trust your gut.
now put on your game face and go in there and listen to the suits.
try not to nod off when they start talking about debt-to-equity ratios.
it's like a sedative. Go on.
okay, one more thing.
when we are in there, I am not "Sweetheart."
okay, baby.
What?Who is this?
God. It's Thelonious, dad.
we've only been getting dialysis for, like, an entire year together.
I'd be more comfortable if you were in your own chair.
it's bad enough to be in kidney failure.
now you're gonna suck all the fun out of it?
I'm just asking... - Honey, let's not fight. Not now.
it's too big a day.
Oh, no. What?
we found a kidney, Jaelynn.
no more dialysis.
Oh, my god, Theo.
I'm getting a kidney.
sweet. - Yeah. Sweet.
did anyone call Jackson for this?
who cares?
I mean, this is... this is his fault.
why do we need an emergency meeting?
hunt quit.
what?
you can't keep throwing that plane crash in his face.
Oh, don't make this my fault.
he walked out. You shouldn't have told him.
Wh... wait. Wait. You told him?
that he might be getting fired? Of course I did.
nothing was decided, and besides, we weren't gonna let Avery get rid of Hunt.
Avery has his own agenda.
no, warning Owen is the least we can do.
we went behind his back long enough.
Cristina, we should probably keep what's said in here private.
well, then count me out.
I have a heart-lung transplant coming in.
Oh, well, Karev's kid just got a kidney from U. N. O. S. - Two transplants in one day?
three with Kepner's D. C. D. - Three?
that doesn't happen.
well, it did, okay?
and the O. R.s are fully booked.
we have half the nursing staff and no transplant coordinator.
who was handling all that?
Hey, what are you all doing about the, uh, Pegasus protocols?
the what now?
Pegasus put all these protocols in place, one of which is telling me that I have to do hernia repairs using their stupid varner technique.
now I have a hernia repair today.
I would like to do it the way I've been successfully doing it since you were sucking your thumb.
we'll look at that.
well, when?
there's all sorts of idiotic rules here, like the O. R. layout and organ transports, bariatric centers.
isn't that why you're the boss now, so the place won't be run by idiots?
thank you, Bailey.
you're welcome, boss.
Hey, have you guys seen chief Hunt?
I would like to know why he signed a death warrant on one of my patients.
well, good luck.
he's gone. He quit. - He... what? Hunt?
ask boss man over here.
there was a disagreement about policy.
Yeah, well, then change the stupid policy.
Unh-unh, not before he changes my stupid policy first.
my hernia's this afternoon.
they're going to get the donor heart and lung as we speak.
we should have you in the O. R. sometime this afternoon.
Oh, not a minute too soon.
you should've seen what I coughed up this morning.
I swear to god, the thing had hands.
Dr. Yang. I was hoping I'd catch you.
Hey, you get your fat head out of my door.
bad enough I gotta watch you go by my window 80 times a day while you walk your stupid laps.
I just want to know if Dr. Yang knows about the pepperoni pizza you've been smuggling in here.
snitch all you want.
I'm not gonna be here much longer.
no kidding? You're dying.
Hey, there is a god, and he's heard my prayers.
uh, Mr. Schulz is getting a heart-lung transplant.
a heart?
well, he doesn't need a heart.
he's got junky lungs.
I've been on this machine for three months, and you're giving that bastard my heart?
you're not looking too good, Herman.
somebody might be dying today.
shut up.
Mr. Crump, please calm down.
Mr. Schulz's heart is compromised because of the stress caused by his pulmonary hypertension.
so a heart-lung transplant is the...
you're gonna have pulmonary hypertension unless you get a supervisor down here.
that doesn't make any sense.
a supervisor, now!
Absolutely.
right away.
so why do they hate each other so much?
they were neighbors.
crump's wife left him for Schulz, like, 30 years ago.
no. - Yes.
she ended up leaving him, too, for some other guy in the neighborhood.
no. - Yes.
no.
can your mind be blown on your own time?
right now I have to talk with my supervisor.
um, well, you own the hospital now.
so doesn't that make you the supervisor?
it does.
so I will have that conversation with myself.
well, should I, like, stick around for that or...
you're pushing all of our surgeries?
there's no place to do them.
Mer, I need you to do a kidney procurement in Missoula.
I gotta stay here and do the transplant, and Robbins is in surgery.
I can't. Hunt is gone, and I have to sort out where all these patients are going.
come on. I'm not gonna risk some Missoula hack screwing up the dissection and giving me some unusable kidney.
Jaelynn got a kidney?
can I do anything?
I said I need a surgeon.
you're not a surgeon yet.
and I forgot. Neither are you.
upper management's too busy to get a kid a kidney.
call Dr. Shepherd and ask him to fix this board, and book me a plane to Missoula.
the patient's this really sweet kid...
whatever. You can come, too.
I-I've heard your plan, but you still haven't heard mine.
I can see not wanting a colonoscopy, but that's not the only option.
we could do radionuclide scans, angiography.
I mean, there's a-a bunch of endoscopic procedures that we could try.
this is why I didn't tell you.
I knew you'd disagree.
and I didn't want to have to spend valuable minutes of my life convincing you.
you're depressed, but we can treat that.
I'm not. - I'm.
A. L. S... is 100% fatal.
if I donate my organs, my death can mean something.
if I keep fighting, I get an infection and can't donate.
I've decided to stop fighting it.
so... We're extra careful and we just make sure that you don't get an infection.
come on. Please let me help you.
there are people who love you, who need you.
come on.
you... you are still alive and so... so you.
Yes.
you're fired.
this is where you should check your meds off every day. Okay?
you'll start your mornings with prednisolone and mycophenolate at 8: 00 A. M.
then follow that with, uh, fk-506 at 10: 00 A. M.
and 10: 00 P. M...
those are for every day.
then you'll also be on trimethoprim-sulfa three times a week.
now you're just making up words.
look, you have to take them no matter what, all right?
or you'll lose the kidney.
you can't miss a dose.
she won't.
fine. I'll do whatever you just said.
okay, the meds, uh, they can cause pretty dramatic mood swings, uh, hair thinning, weight gain, diarrhea, acne.
I mean, they don't always happen, but if they do, don't be alarmed.
if you were dying, would you donate your organs?
of course.
even if you still had time?
this the D. C. D. guy?
I have a plan.
he just won't even listen to it.
you know, he's a doctor.
he knows the deal. He's not gonna get any better.
Yeah, but... - He's gonna save a crapload of people.
I think it's awesome.
he's got perfectly good organs. Might as well use them.
Oh, my god. He has good organs.
that is genius. I am a genius.
so you'll have to pick up Zola.
did you sort out the O. R. board?
I started, but I have a surgery.
I have Torres looking at it right now.
why are you on a plane?
Oh, because Alex wants his kid's kidney mobilized before perfusion, and he's being a giant baby about it.
all right. Well, call me when you get back.
okay.
he doesn't mean to be a giant baby.
Karev... I think he just hates feeling like you guys left him in the dark.
you don't have to teach me how to speak Alex. I'm fluent.
I'm just learning.
I shouldn't take it personally that he's acting like he hates me, right?
I mean, he's just feeling abandoned by everyone in his life right now, and the fact that I'm dating a guy and not available to go to Joe's bar every night is just...
he's feeling hurt and lonely.
or he hates you.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
what's wrong?
she locked herself in there.
Jaelynn, sweetie. It's okay. Come on out.
Jaelynn, it's Dr. Karev.
look, Jaelynn, come on. I know it's scary. Just come out and we'll talk.
you can ask me whatever you want.
it's the silent treatment.
she won't crack.
once we took her phone from her.
she didn't speak to us for seven days.
Oh, she's talking to somebody.
she texting you?
maybe. - Tell her to come out of the bathroom.
I don't tell her what to do.
just do it.
make me.
are you for real?
Dr. D. F.?
Dr. Douche face.
who's that supposed to be?
who do you think? Now give it back.
make me.
it's called a domino transplant.
because you guys are the same blood type, we will put the new heart and lungs into Mr. Schulz, and then take Mr. Schulz's original heart and give it to Mr. Crump.
so his heart in my body?
nothing doing.
it-it's the best solution in this case.
the best solution is a 62 year old getting a 70-year-old's hand-me-downs?
technically, all donor hearts are hand-me-downs.
Mr. Schulz's heart is 80% functional.
yours is only 10%.
Yeah, you hear that?
80%. You'd be lucky to get a ticker like this one.
I'd be lucky if you dropped dead right now and I got the fresh heart.
Mr. Crump, you should really consider this op...
look, I would rather croak than have this bastard's old lump of meat in my chest.
this day just keeps getting better and better.
Yeah, right. It's great.
okay, sir. You need to sit down.
no, I need to get out of this room.
sir, calm down.
just... please. -Get out of my...
so he's rejecting the heart out of spite?
Yeah. I can't figure out how to talk him into taking it.
have you talked to Owen?
uh, no. But I know him. He just needs time.
what is your husband's deal anyway?
you know, it's like everyone has gone crazy.
Owen and Derek are at each other's throats.
Avery's on some kind of power trip.
you know, I am supposed to be prepping for a major transplant, and Callie's left me with an O. R.board that's like a rubik's cube.
in charge one day, and already the hospital's spinning out of control?
okay, I gotta go. We're here.
uh, you need to stop listening to my conversations.
is the place really spinning out of control?
what? No, of course not.
shut up. Everything's perfectly fine.
where is everybody?
they've gone.
we're pretty much done here.
what do you mean done? Where's our kidney?
why do you look confused?
where is our kidney?
hands off my kidney!
I'm telling you, this isn't your kidney.
and I'm telling you, show me the paperwork to prove that, or I'm gonna reach down your throat and take one of yours.
I found our kidney.
great. Now call off your attack dog.
Wilson, stand down.
where is it?
it hopped a flight to Seattle.
all by itself? How'd it do that?
I don't know. We gotta get home.
come on. Let's go.
you sent her an emoticon of a bee and an ice cube?
it means "Be chill" and come out of the bathroom.
I know it's you.
Theo would never text emoticons.
just... give me five minutes, and then I will never bother you about it again.
okay.
five minutes, but in here.
I know you're scared, but you need this kidney.
at least with dialysis, I won't go bald, get fat, and poop my pants.
that's not the solution, and you know it.
can't I, like, take the next one?
I'm, like, not ready for this.
Yes, you are.
look, Jaelynn, um, there's this girl, and I didn't tell her that I was into her, and now she's with some dude with big arms.
um, are you, like, hitting on me?
cause you're, like, old.
God. No. No. No, my-my p-point is, is that this-this kidney is a good thing, and that you need to take the good things when they're in front of you, because if you don't, someone else will.
so you're saying, take this kidney so some dude with big arms doesn't get it?
Yeah.
let's get her prepped.
don't leave her side.
got it.
how's it looking?
you sent me all the way out here to get a kidney that's already flying coach to Seattle as an unaccompanied minor?
what?
I don't even know who's coming to pick it up.
find out.
Alex, I... - Look, just deal with it, okay?
are you okay there? You look a little overwhelmed. Anything I can help you with?
can you read everything in my arms and own this hospital?
you actually gonna look at those protocols or just keep carrying 'em around?
right. Your hernia. I'm gonna get you an answer just as soon as I...
too late.
I already did it, my way.
that's not... Bailey, you shouldn't...
well, you couldn't make a decision, so I made it myself.
you gonna get rid of me now like you did Hunt?
I didn't get rid of Hunt.
why... - Sign this.
what is this?
authorization for a domino transplant. - Yes, why am I...
because when you anoint yourself king, it comes with certain responsibilities.
you have to sign this.
I need to know what this is first.
well, I could take the time to explain to you how a heart-lung domino transplant works, but by then, both my patients will be dead.
I know how a damn domino works.
here, take these. - What are they?
hunt left before he could coordinate the recovery teams for your D. C. D. patient.
so it's just a list of which organs are going where.
Yeah, well, he's not my patient anymore, Pehis request...
just sign this. - Just handle it, please.
Hey, make sure you sign your own name, not your mom's.
Really?
Avery. - What?
I want to know who the hell sent my kidney flying coach to Seattle when I sent two surgeons to pick it up.
wait. What are you talking about?
he's talking about the protocols.
look... Pegasus policy states, look, "Donated kidneys coming from outside a certain radius
will be flown unaccompanied," "saving personnel hours."
so when the other hospital called, the nurse just told 'em to put it on a plane.
told you they were stupid rules.
you should read 'em sometime.
Oh, great. Does anybody know what's going on?
tough day, boss?
he is drowning, and he is taking my hospital down with him.
where is all this drama coming from?
he will handle this.
just give him time.
he's paralyzed.
decisions are like building blocks.
he'll make one, then another will follow.
you do not do this job one calmly thought-out decision at a time.
you're spinning plates, ten at a time, and you're doing it at a sprint.
he will get there.
you act like I don't have any idea what I'm talking about.
when I was chief, I worked hand in hand with the board.
so I know what it takes to... - You are not doing it now, Richard.
I am not thinking of myself, Catherine.
I'm thinking of your son.
look, if he fails at this, it will follow him his whole life.
it'll define his entire career... this failure... and he didn't even choose it.
his mother chose it for him.
you find me a real heart yet?
I've got a real heart for you.
you just have to get over yourself.
move on.
whatever it is that happened between the two of you is so far in the past...
it's like it was yesterday.
okay, fine.
you can't forgive him.
so don't.
beat him.
take his perfectly good heart and outlive him with it.
there's, uh... Really enough juice left in that heart to get me to his funeral?
there's enough juice to get you dancing on his grave.
then my heart will stop.
the monitor will flatline.
and you guys will have to get out of there.
because the docs... will only have five minutes to open me up or my organs will be no good.
are you sure?
are you sure?
don't do this now, mom.
I know it's selfish, but I want more minutes.
the closer it gets... I will support you either way.
but if you want to stop... We can end this right now and go home.
mom.
she just wants to make sure that if you have any doubts...
your son is still a doctor.
and... he wants to save a-a 17-year-old girl in Idaho who is gonna get one of his kidneys.
the other one is going to a-a 44-year-old councilman in Nevada.
his kidney could be president one day.
you get it now.
I do.
keep going.
half of your liver is going to a-a 50-year-old artist right here at Seattle Grace.
and a 10-year-old in Oregon will get to play on his little league team 'cause of the other half.
did you get the O. R. straightened out?
the place doesn't run without Owen, Derek. You know it.
I didn't force him to leave.
but once he started talking about who's to blame...
because he feels the blame, every day since it's happened.
and you remind him again and again.
you say you forgive him, but you don't or you won't.
so what is it?
what is this about?
cause it's not about him.
where are you going?
surgery. Remember that?
no, I'm in 2. - No, you're not.
I am. Move. I've got a domino transplant.
and I'm getting a kid off dialysis.
I can totally wait.
no, you can't.
well, I can't.
let's get this show on the road.
this kid's a flight risk.
find someplace else.
this O. R.'s the only one that's staffed.
could you guys please shut up?
my patient is trying to die in here, and he'd like to do it in silence.
Oh, god. He's dying in there?
maybe you should go first.
how long is he gonna be?
because Yang needs the O. R.
I've got an O. R. - Shut up!
Hey, all of you shut up.
all right, here's what you're gonna do...
okay, just, uh, give me one second.
Kepner, go back to your patient.
he can take as long as he needs.
we will wait.
yang, you're in O. R. 2.
what? No. Heart and lungs trump kidneys.
take the patient back to holding, and the next O. R.
that's available is yours.
you can't... - That is it.
well, you heard the man.
he's the boss. Now move.
it's about time.
you mean "Thank you, Meredith" "for carrying a kidney across state lines for me."
whatever. Hand it over.
can I scrub in?
I'd love to... - I got Murphy.
you want me to apologize, Alex?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry we bought the hospital.
I'm sorry you have to think of us as your bosses now.
but we didn't do it for just us.
we did it for everyone...
for you, for Wilson, who, by the way, fought so hard for you today,
I thought she might cut someone to get you that kidney.
so drop the attitude before nobody wants to work with you anymore.
there's nothing to talk about, Shepherd. Move on.
Oh, come on.
this is costing me gas.
you can afford it.
nobody blames you for hiring the plane.
not me, not anybody else, and you shouldn't either.
you never would've signed that paper if you knew what was gonna happen.
let it go.
you blame me.
you said it, Shepherd.
you said it again this morning.
I was pissed.
I've been pissed, but not at you.
the world.
Yeah.
yeah... I'm pissed at Mark.
you gotta let that go.
it's almost time.
when the monitor goes, when he's gone.
they'll have to start operating, so... We should probably pay our respects now.
time of death... 18: 46.
start the clock.
no. No.
hazel, we only have five minutes or this will all have been for nothing.
come on.
okay. I'm sorry.
No! - Honey, we've been preparing for this. Let's go.
no. Come on. No! Come on, dear. No.
okay, I am... I am sorry, Hazel.
I'm so, so sorry.
come on. Come on.
no. Sweetie. Come on. No.
was he there?
no.
move over.
Yeah. I heard you almost killed somebody trying to get Jaelynn her kidney, and I was kind of a douche face, and... anyway, I'm-I'm sorry.
and thanks. - Okay.
can I, uh, buy you a beer or something?
um, I'm all set.
Yeah, we both are.
we're all set.
well, that was, uh... What were we talking about?
I'm sorry. What?
okay, thanks. - Thank you, doctor.
he stepped up, didn't he, my reluctant son?
if I were the kind of woman to say "I told you so," this might be the time.
he got through the day.
Oh, come on.
can't you just say that I was right once?
no, not when the stakes are this high.
you want him to step up, but the steps are too high, and the consequences for his career are too grave.
it's not fair to him.
don't you tell me what's not fair for my son.
you want to give professional advice?
fine. But you're wandering into parenting advice, and that is not your place.
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. I overstepped.
Yes, sir, you did.
you ever... You ever say something and then a minute later, realize you sound like a complete imbecile?
um, that's... never happened to me.
I've been a single mom for 28 years, ever since Jackson's dad ran off to god knows where because he couldn't stand the pressure of being an Avery.
and I've been looking for a man who cared about Jackson the way a parent would, and...
the moment I find him, I bite his head off.
you're always gonna know what's best for Jackson.
Yeah, right there.
okay, thank you.
well... That's it, then.
we're officially the new board of directors.
for better or worse.
thank you.
congratulations, everyone.
actually, I'd like to share a list of a few things I think are our top priority.
you mean that the foundation thinks... - No, I don't, actually...
mean the foundation or my mom or these stupid protocols.
I mean me.
okay, well... let's just listen.
okay, I'll listen.
number one, I move that we reinstate Owen Hunt as chief of surgery, effective immediately.
Dr. Hunt has agreed to this.
there were some conditions.
which brings me to my second point.
we are reopening the E. R.
we will be a level-I trauma center again.
that will be top priority once Owen Hunt is here to share his input.
from now on, the foundation will follow our lead.
we will tell them our decisions as we make them.
well, hear, hear.
Yeah. No, that sounds good.
I've got one more thing.
maybe you shouldn't push it.
the transplant process is very scary.
we are building a new hospital.
and that was your vision, not mine.
my priority is to make sure your vision comes true.
and while it is important that we become a leading center for research and innovation, we have to remember something...
we are now officially a hospital run by doctors.
that should mean something.
it is our responsibility to be the best doctors we can possibly be so that those who come after us can strive to be their best.
so... with that in mind, I move to rename the hospital.
again?
why would we do that?
to-to what?
let me guess.
the Harper Avery hospital?
no. I propose that we give this hospital a name that can honor the very reason we've come together and been able to do this, a name that exemplifies the spirit of this hospital, but also the depth of our dedication.
a patient goes from worrying about getting an organ to worrying if the organ will be rejected.
all in favor?
Aye.
Aye.
the anxiety continues until they can finally open their eyes after surgery and see that their gift has been accepted.
it takes a lot of money to keep a hospital's doors open.
and when the fund's run out, it's on us to get out there and raise some more.
which means...
it's time to put on makeup.
it's time to dress up right.
it's time to get things started on "The Muppet Show" to...
crap. Sorry.
I've been watching a lot of children's television lately.
are we ready to go?
but you get the idea.
uh, almost. Someone doesn't want to put her shoes on.
can I just get a word?
we're trying to raise money tonight, not waste it.
I grew up in this world. I know how it works.
we're attracting serious people with serious money and tailoring an event to them.
tonight is gonna be tasteful, sophisticated, conservative.
come in.
you and I have very different definitions of the word "conservative."
Ari... what did you spend my money on?
this is what you want. You want spectacle...
pizzazz. - Do I look like someone who wants pizzazz?
when people think of hospitals, they think of death, disease... old people.
not sexy. We are giving them Las Vegas.
we are giving them a show.
he's falling apart.
he's refused to use incentive spirometry.
look, and his right lung is just about ready to collapse.
if he wants to suffer, then maybe we let him.
Oh, so you're gonna let him die because he hurt your feelings?
there isn't anything that he can say to me that I haven't heard from my mother a thousand times.
I'm bulletproof.
but we can force all the treatment on him we want.
gene Steers' P. E. T. scan results.
um, call respiratory, and get Dr. Webber started on C. P. A. P.
Oh, he is not going to like that. - He doesn't have to like it.
he just has to do it.
trade assignments with me. - No.
you're in a bad mood because your crappy boyfriend didn't invite you to the gala.
but you know what's gonna make you feel better?
spending a night on the peds floor...
with all of the delightful little children.
or I could just punch my crappy boyfriend in the junk.
why not both?
Shane, trade with me. - I'm a surgeon, not a babysitter.
me either. Why do I get screwed? - Cruel twist of fate?
it's just the two of you down here tonight, so if you find yourselves in over your head, call a grown-up.
Kepner, kid in bed 8 has abdominal pain and vomiting.
if C. T.'s negative, give him fluids and send him home.
don't we look spiffy. - Yeah, I do.
you look like crap.
I haven't had a chance to freshen up yet, you ass.
watch your back! Coming through! - Holy heck.
Hey, what's the story?
once upon a time, three idiots got wasted - and ran their car into a tree. - They're drunk?
no, high as kites.
lucky they were the only ones that got hurt.
Hey, Sinatra, I'll give you a fiver for a glass of wine.
sir, what'd you take?
it's heroin. Add a tox screen to their trauma labs.
what's your name? - No I. D. on any of 'em.
we've been going with John, Jerry, and Jake Doe.
cute. - Okay, let's hustle, get a full trauma workup so I can get upstairs and run a brush through my hair.
Meredith Grey, as I live and breathe.
I haven't seen you in ages. How's, uh...
Derek liking maternity leave?
he's on paternity leave.
Yeah, okay. - We have a deal.
I don't work. Neither does he.
it's working out well.
I live in your house. You're bored out of your minds.
Yeah, they've got all this pent-up surgical energy and now everything's a competition.
it is not. - And he's winning.
he is not winning.
he couldn't even get Zola to put her shoes on tonight.
I did that. I got her to put her shoes on.
so I'm winning.
I need to come back to work.
that's the creepiest waiter I've ever seen.
Bailey's gonna lose her mind. She can't stand clowns.
this is gonna be hilarious. - Bailey's not coming.
What?! Wait, we can do that?
I'm going home. - Wait, nobody's going home.
spread the... word.
Derek is really good at this kind of thing.
I should get started before he does. - Oh, I think he already has.
amazing.
I have to confess something. I know who you are.
I saw your video from the T. E. D. conference and I just... I'm sorry. I'm a little starstruck.
Really?
yeah... you know, I go every year, and...
so many of the talks often focus on the tech you spoke from the heart. you might be surprised...
the truth. You're an inspiration.
if I lost my wife in a plane crash...
Oh, I'm sorry. What?
your wife. She... passed away, right?
yes... she did.
it's...
it's been really hard.
you and I have to join forces so that Derek does not win Avery's money.
prison's changed you.
we are in trouble.
Avery bet the farm on this party.
listen to you two.
this is not that difficult. Just be charming.
use the same skills you would if you were picking someone up at a bar. I know you know how to do that.
and you need to practice if we're gonna get serious about meeting new people.
you need to let that go. - Ooh, Richie Rich, 10: 00.
Mr. Steers, I know this is hard to hear, but the P. E.T. scan showed your cancer has spread.
I'm afraid surgery is no longer an option.
I'll tell you what's hard...
this pillow.
we've talked about this.
victoria is from the Philippines.
that's what I said. - No, it isn't!
okay, fine.
so no surgery. What's that mean?
more chemo? What's the next step?
um, these are brochures from several local facilities that can help ease you into the final stages.
when you're ready, we can talk about which might be the best fit.
best fit is gonna be the one with topless nurses.
I don't need any of that fully nude business.
they don't serve booze at the joints where the girls ditch their skivvies.
matter of fact, how about I slip you a tenner, you slip me a bottle of somethin'?
I'll call if I start to feel weepy.
what are you doing? - Eating shrimp at a party.
I just spent 20 minutes talking to donors about you when they'd prefer to be talking to you.
you need to... Alex...
have you been listening to me? - I gotta get some air.
where the hell are you going? - Hey, Jackson!
champagne?
this is amazing!
Oh, the magician... incredible. - This is warm.
Oh, yeah, big bird said there's no ice.
we have some back at the hospital.
they can bring a patient's temperature down in minutes, right?
no reason those can't chill a bottle. - That's ridiculous.
then it's on theme for the night.
and I can't leave.
um... could you please run back and grab 'em?
fine.
though, honestly, that story I don't think is, uh...
appropriate. - Well, I'll tell you what, chief.
I'm gonna take a walk over to that table,
well, now I want to hear that story.
Oh, chief of surgery.
I wasn't sure when I got a load of the clowns.
Oh, come on. Clowns are great.
people love clowns.
you worried me there for a second.
Oh, really?
Hey, um... buy you a drink?
isn't it an open bar? - The price is right.
okay. - Thanks.
what was that? - What was what?
that whole sparkly eye thing.
well, I can't help it if my eyes have a natural sparkle.
you were flirting. I don't know what you're talking about.
go juggle some balls.
you just brought a knife to a gun fight.
do you need a hand? - No, no. Um, I'll be fine.
grab these.
cool.
Jake's febrile and he's got a crazy-high white count.
you factor in the heroin, and we're probably looking at endocarditis.
and I think he's got a pericardial effusion.
so he could tamponade at the drop of a hat.
and there's another multiple trauma on its way in.
this is like medical whac-a-mole. I love it.
great, uh, what about those guys?
uh, they're pretty banged up, but nothing we can't handle.
great. Good. Uh, keep it up.
nothing we can't handle? - We've been preparing for this all year.
they have their party tonight. This is ours. Enjoy it.
Oh, he's bleeding from his chest tube.
did you check his coags? - Uh, they're still pending.
uh, get me a petroleum dressing and some gauze!
and call X-ray to get here stat!
doctors! Incoming!
you want to call someone, or do you wanna be a rock star?
I want those trauma rooms ready for action.
anyone who can be moved, move them!
we need all the empty beds we can get!
Hey! You heard her. Lock and load!
okay, let's move!
I know, look. - Isn't that something?
you pulled a sleeping baby out of day care to do your dirty work?
you're disgusting. - He's got his mother's sparkle.
Hello, baby.
Oh, and he's hungry.
convenient.
he's my guy.
I'm gonna kill you dead.
Oh, you're under a lot of pressure at work.
lots of late nights and weekends.
but still, you stay active. Lots of, uh, physical activity?
you can tell all that from my pulse?
sure... and the way the tux fits.
Oh, my, this watch is gorgeous.
it's vintage. It was my father's, actually.
he, uh... he... he would wager watches. - Mm-hmm.
and so he won this one. - You know, you need another one.
I'll be right back.
there is a gal over there doing close-up magic.
you have to see it.
Emma Marling, this is Dr. Cristina Yang...
our best cardio fellow. - How's it hanging?
go on. You're missing the magic.
whiskey soda. - Coming right up.
you are barking up the wrong tree with that one.
you're never gonna get a donation out of her.
those shoes... outlet mall all the way.
you want...
that.
what... that old lady?
that old lady in Chanel. - Here you go.
thank you.
go get 'em, tiger.
it was a beautiful service, but after...
little Sofia just kept asking...
why is mommy not coming home with us?
you are so strong.
no, it's...
really, it's my work that's kept me strong.
this... this hospital, you know, these...
these people. - That's beautiful.
where can I make my donation? - Right over there next to the stairs.
the nights are the hardest, though.
I know exactly what you mean.
ever since Harvey died, I can't fall asleep in our bed.
I spend all of my nights on the couch...
with the cat.
exactly.
wait, what?
what is the matter with you?
I-I know this is a difficult time, but you cannot talk to my nurses that way.
your move. - What?
I figured out your problem. Your mind is all closed off.
Oh-oh, my mind is closed?
here... I figured you'd want to play black,'cause, well...
you know.
if there was anything I thought we could try...
there is.
make a move. - Yeah, I have other patients.
I-I can't just stand here and... - What would Rosa Parks say?
excuse me? - Or Martin Luther King?
you think they would just stand over there and make excuses like you are?
you people are supposed to be tougher than this.
I'll have a counselor come by - and talk to you about the brochures. - Oh, I see.
you're giving up on me because you don't like the way I talk.
you're just gonna let me die 'cause I offend you.
I am trying to give you the best care I possibly can despite the fact that you offend me.
you are rude and demeaning, and I am still trying to help you move on in the most comfortable way possible.
I am not going to move on.
I'm not gonna pass away or go to heaven or make a journey home.
I am going to die.
my lungs are gonna deflate.
I'm gonna lose control of my bowels.
my tongue's gonna roll to the back of my head.
I am going to be dead.
there's no making it sound nice or pretty.
it is not good. I am going to cease to exist.
and I don't want to. I am not ready.
so get off your ass and do something!
what the hell are you doing?
he needs a pericardiocentesis. - Yeah, we can't just do that.
stop! I'm calling someone. - Not yet.
Shane! - Not yet.
this is really very sweet of you.
but you know, you don't have to...
you don't have to sit here with me.
I don't mind.
I just...
I can't stand the way she looks at me, the way that everyone looks at me.
uh, no one's looking at you. - Please.
I grew up gay.
I know what it feels like when people are staring.
you're missing a leg, and they stare.
and everyone knows you're a cheater, and they stare.
and they talk, and they judge, and they... stare.
like that. - What?
c-come on now, you were telling a story. - I know...
I know how you must feel about me.
and I know you try and hide it, but I can see it on your face.
what do you think you see?
you know...
Jesus.
Oh, come on.
Oh, what, to be... it's... I-I'm incapable of empathy because I go to church? What is that about?
I can empathize like nobody's business, especially with a cheater.
you're right.
I'm sorry.
thank you.
I'm sorry for calling you a cheater.
I am, though.
I know.
she stared at me, too.
but the way she stared...
felt... really, really good.
you know?
actually, I do.
and then...
he chainsawed his leg off.
but that's not even close to the strangest thing I've seen.
though, honestly, I'm not sure that story is appropriate.
gentlemen, that story's gonna have to wait.
okay, I look forward to it.
I've been watching you. - Oh.
chatting up our donors, stealing my stories.
you're a thief. - You've been watching me?
Mm-hmm. Who are you?
Dr. Emma Marling, maternal-fetal medicine, Seattle Pres.
after that storm, we've been hurting, too...
badly.
I've been pushing our board to throw a fund-raiser for weeks, and I can't get any traction. So here I am...
borrowing yours. I'm not a thief.
you stole my story. - It's a good story.
I don't get this. You are here to get donations, and you spend all this time talking to me.
you-you want me to say it?
I mean, look at you.
impressive party.
another whiskey soda.
that's your fifth one.
who are you, my mom? I'm not drinking.
gotta stay sharp.
this is for the C. F.O. of A. E. C. interactive.
got him on the ropes.
every drink he knocks back is another "zero" added to the check
I collect at the end of the night.
that sounds wrong.
right and wrong don't live here, son.
this is the wild west.
this is so much fun!
it's like when we were interns...
stealing surgeries, playing dirty.
I don't really get to do that anymore.
does this look stupid?
the kid spit up on my dress, and in my dress...
all over, really.
Oh, for the love of god, Mer. You're making it so easy.
every night, Harvey would whisper,"I love you" into my ear just as I was falling asleep.
it's been ten years since, and still, every night, I feel like I can hear his voice.
do you ever feel like that... like she's still with you?
all right.
can I have your attention, please?
Oh, speech! Speech! Everybody, hush up!
Oh, sorry. He's gonna talk now.
thank you. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I am Dr. Jackson Avery.
and on behalf of the board of Grey Sloan memorial hospital,
I just want to say,"welcome."
thank you. Thank you.
thank you very much.
now over the past year, we have seen many changes, from a change in name to a change in leadership...
and it has all been a challenge.
thank you.
as surgeons...
wait!
was that part of it? - I don't think so.
Oh, no, no, no! You need to stop.
you could have internal injuries or breaks.
um... I think I'm okay. See?
I'm okay. I'm fine.
so, yeah, I'd say there's a break.
what's the update on those paramedics, Avery? - Should be here any minute.
no pulse. Okay. Hold still. This is gonna hurt.
do you think he's watching? - Who?
Richie Rich. 'Cause we look freaking amazing right now.
Cristina, gross!
edwards, someone better be dying.
I'm really hoping to avoid that, Dr. Yang.
Ross is doing a pericardial window in the E. R.
okay, when he aspirates the fluid, get him to the O. R. I'm on my way.
go. We got this. - This way, guys.
where are you going? - Oh, back to the hospital.
some junkie with endocarditis is tamponading. - Which junkie?
there's more than one?
it's all about forgiveness. Mm-hmm.
and that's... that's what's important.
you... he... he sees me for who I am.
and he accepts me for what I've done.
but that's... that's everything.
are we talking about Matthew or Jesus?
Dr. Robbins? - Yes!
you paged me...
to a closet? - I need you to run across to the gala and grab a bottle of champagne because - we're low. - We are low.
and snacks!
screw this day. - Uh, thank you, Murphy.
thank you.
you think Callie's ever gonna forgive me?
probably not.
she's telling everybody at the gala that you're dead.
you know, we're about ready to roll.
Hey, I'm coming, too.
how are we doing on our fund-raising goal?
Oh, we're not even halfway there.
well, then you've got plenty to do here.
I'm worried about internal injuries.
make sure they rush her to C. T. -All right.
you're not coming?
we're on maternity leave. We have a deal.
Mer, let's go. We need all hands on deck.
let me go!
let go! Dr. Webber... please!
Dr. Webber... - Oh! I-I can take it from here.
I can take it. - Let go!
I don't want this.
there's a man down the hall. He is ornery.
he's a jackass. He's dying.
and he won't stop fighting, even though there isn't anything I can do for him.
and then I've got you.
you've got a million options, and you refuse to try.
you have atelectasis.
you are in danger for pneumothorax pneumonia, R. D. S.
and Meredith Grey is ready to let you slip into a coma.
but I am not! You breathe in through this, your lungs get stronger, you get better.
it's damn simple math.
what do you wanna do?
this is dumb. Put this on. Put... - No! No!
just... Richard! - No.
get the hell...out!
let's take him off bypass and see how we did.
everything okay, Dr. Yang?
pericardial window is a pretty risky move for an intern.
I... I didn't have a choice.
the fluid was too thick for a pericardiocentesis.
you had a choice.
you could have called someone the minute he tamponaded, but you didn't.
you basically got to do a surgery in the E. R.
and now you're up here with me, while Edwards is down in the pit.
you're a shark. - I'm not! I swear.
Ross, it's a good thing.
all great surgeons are sharks.
you see what you want and do whatever it takes to get it.
like me. And never apologize.
sharks don't apologize.
monitor. - Here you go.
Where's that coming from?
it's coming from inside. That means we have two options.
one... we can put him back on bypass, undo all our work, and find the source, or...
two... I take a guess, throw in a U-stitch and hope I don't shred the heart in the process.
Dr. Ross, what do you think?
sharks don't swim backward. Only forward... or they die.
option 2 it is. 4-0 prolene.
here you go.
there it is.
what's supposed to happen?
if it worked, nothing. If it didn't...
lots.
that'll do, sharky. That'll do.
Murphy, those aren't for you. - Yeah, I know.
have you seen my wife?
uh, she, uh, hopped on a rig with the paramedics.
question of the night!
you know, I should be at work right now.
you know, Stephanie doesn't realize how lucky she is.
she should be thanking you instead of being pissed at you.
Yeah. Wait, what?
she wanted to come tonight? - She bought a dress.
she never said anything. - Of course not.
if she had to say something, it wouldn't mean as much as if you'd had the idea on your own. - Oh, my god.
my head hurts so much. - It doesn't matter now.
the party died the minute the aerialist fell on big bird.
people see a woman's tibia impale her own foot, it's hard to steer the conversation - in a different direction. - They're gonna be fine.
all right. There's a hospital right down...
down the street.
you know what? Ladies and gentlemen!
folks, wait a second.
Dr. Bailey?
Dr. Bailey, please?
what do you need?
I haven't played chess in a year.
I can't keep having this fight, Gene.
no, I know. I just...
the guys at the park stopped letting me play.
cause of the things I say.
I'm not trying to offend you.
that's not true.
I said a couple of those things on purpose.
so... I'm sorry.
you don't have to play the game, but please...
I'm scared.
I don't have anybody.
I don't want to be alone.
what are you doing?
repairing a gastric rupture. It's fun.
you can't just decide to operate.
Derek, you're better at charming the donors than I am.
I admit it. You can have it.
we had a deal. - You're more than welcome to come and join me.
come get a little blood on your hands.
I'll even let you hold a retractor.
all right, I'm gonna change.
Oh, this is really, really fun, and I needed fun.
me, too.
can I try on your leg?
I was cornered by the widow amos...
who was, you know, actually a widow.
her story was so sad, and she took out her checkbook, and I...
Ugh, I'm so gross.
Yeah.
I sort of get it, though.
Really? - Mm. This stuff...
it's not easy.
and Cristina... she keeps pushing me to date.
God, I can't even think about that.
Yeah. You really can't keep telling people that she's dead.
I know.
doctors, we have visitors.
what is he up to? - I don't know.
okay, now if you'll notice the pins that Dr. Torres is drilling into place... that is the external fixation - I was telling you about. - Are-are we allowed to be here?
Yes, I spoke with Irina's husband.
he said that if there's one thing that she believes in, it's that the show must go on.
now we showed you guys a circus tonight.
but this... this is the real show.
this is what we do here.
we are gonna get this woman back on her feet.
and then before you leave this evening,
I would ask that you please consider helping us get back on ours.
how much do you need?
I usually have really good radar for this crap.
what are you talking about? - What the hell is this?
Oh, that's not funny.
don't freaking joke like that. I don't do that.
I'm just trying to do a freakin' blood draw.
Why? - I think my dad's in the hospital.
I don't understand what that means.
I don't know. I can't...
I haven't seen him in 20 years.
and this guy... some old junkie...
crashed a car, has no I. D., he's ragged, wrecked.
but his voice in the E. R... Guy called me Sinatra.
it was like somebody poured ice water down my neck.
that feeling hasn't gone away.
so this is a paternity test? - I don't know.
no.
I thought I could live the rest of my life and never see him again.
I don't want it to be him.
if you take the test, then you'll know for sure.
if it isn't him, then that feeling will go away.
I guess that's true.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
you know, I'm actually pretty smart.
you'd know that if you tried talking to me instead of ditching me at fancy parties.
I'm sorry. - Yeah.
okay.
that surgery was incredible.
I haven't felt this relaxed in months. - Me either.
what? - Reminiscing.
about?
you, me, an exam room, and your panties pinned to a bulletin board.
Oh, the prom.
except you didn't have blood on your suit, - and I wasn't wearing a sweatshirt. - I think it's sexy.
now you're doing the sparkly eye thing.
I have no idea what you're talking about. - Mm-hmm.
is it working?
Hey, hey! What... what's this?
you're getting a roommate.
gene, Richard. Richard, Gene.
calm down, dick.
the way you look, can't imagine you're gonna be around much longer anyway.
these are a few options for facilities that assist with end of life care.
since you two are in the same boat, figured you could go through them together.
crack a window when you go.
smells like something died in here.
Jake's in the I. C.U. Should pull through.
how are things down here?
Oh, you know...
only amazing.
I cannot believe I was in such a snit over not going to a stupid party.
I mean, I have done burr holes, a crike, and I pulled a hunk of glass this big out of a dude's face!
you were totally right. I am a rock star.
you are a rock star. We are rock stars.
we're not rock stars. We're sharks.
we're rock sharks!
okay, then.
I heard you were here. I just wanted to, um, - catch you before you leave. - Here... here I am.
I like the blue. - Oh, thank you.
there are more zeroes than fit in this little box.
let's get outta here.
to... uh, where?
come on. Don't be coy.
you like me.
there's no way this was all about the money.
no, it was all about the money.
you flirt with me all night, get me to write this big check, - and then nothing? - Yeah.
and you don't feel even a little bit bad about that?
no.
that's actually even hotter.
you have a good night.
it doesn't have to be all about money.
you could sleep with me for free.
I have to talk to you.
look, I don't know what happened... - Oh, would you stop?
I've been here too many times, honestly.
I'm too old. I'm too busy to be playing games with you.
I'm not playing games.
you're pissed because I didn't invite you to this stupid thing, and now you're getting back at me with Ross.
that's not true.
Oh, you're not pissed at me? - Yes! I was. Yeah, I was, okay?
you threw a party, and you didn't invite me.
so yeah, my feelings were hurt a little bit.
but that has nothing to do with what happened in the E. R.
Ross kissed me.
I don't know where it came from.
I did not ask for it.
I swear.
fine.
fine? - Yeah... fine.
and this wasn't a party. This was work.
nobody wanted to come. I never thought you did.
if you and I are gonna do this, you've gotta start talking to me.
no more getting mad and then waiting to see if I know you're mad - or any of that. - Yeah, okay.
I didn't want him to kiss me.
I want you to kiss me.
look at this.
sunshine and daisies and friggin' bunny rabbits.
could be worse.
you could die in that bed...
in this room.
this hospital could be the last place you see.
you don't want to die here.
no. I don't.
it is a pretty lawn.
if I gotta kick, could be nice to do it outside.
the food's gotta be better than what they serve here.
I wouldn't feed that slop to a gypsy.
I said "I wouldn't." I was being nice.
Hey! Are-are you gonna head back up the street?
uh, no, I was just heading home.
listen, I don't blame you for not wanting to get out there and date. People are...
gross.
but we look great. So you wanna go hit Joe's?
Oh, sorry, am I interrupting? - You're here?
Yeah, I... uh, really, uh, had a good excuse all worked up, and now I'm completely blanking.
I was just heading home.
it was really nice to meet you.
you, too.
good night.
overture, curtain, lights.
I have the results.
this is it...
the night of nights.
I don't wanna know... - He's your dad.
what?
Oh, my god. I jumped the gun.
I am sorry. I am so sorry.
shotgun! I get car sick in the back.
Ugh, I might get car sick in the front.
thank you.
I'm about to take my intern exam, which means I am about to be a second-year resident.
my babysitting days are done.
you're adorable.
excuse me.
no more rehearsing and nursing a part.
we know every part by heart.
Ross, what's going on? - Multi-car mash-up in the E. R.
be a shame to wake the kids.
tonight, what heights we'll hit. On with the show.
this is it.
I'm Dr. Grey.
it takes a lot of money to keep a hospital's doors open.
and when the fund's run out, it's on us to get out there and raise some more.
which means...
it's time to put on makeup.
it's time to dress up right.
it's time to get things started on "The Muppet Show" to...
crap. Sorry.
I've been watching a lot of children's television lately.
are we ready to go?
but you get the idea.
uh, almost. Someone doesn't want to put her shoes on.
can I just get a word?
we're trying to raise money tonight, not waste it.
I grew up in this world. I know how it works.
we're attracting serious people with serious money and tailoring an event to them.
tonight is gonna be tasteful, sophisticated, conservative.
come in.
you and I have very different definitions of the word "conservative."
Ari... what did you spend my money on?
this is what you want. You want spectacle...
pizzazz. - Do I look like someone who wants pizzazz?
when people think of hospitals, they think of death, disease... old people.
not sexy. We are giving them Las Vegas.
we are giving them a show.
he's falling apart.
he's refused to use incentive spirometry.
look, and his right lung is just about ready to collapse.
if he wants to suffer, then maybe we let him.
Oh, so you're gonna let him die because he hurt your feelings?
there isn't anything that he can say to me that I haven't heard from my mother a thousand times.
I'm bulletproof.
but we can force all the treatment on him we want.
gene Steers' P. E. T. scan results.
um, call respiratory, and get Dr. Webber started on C. P. A. P.
Oh, he is not going to like that. - He doesn't have to like it.
he just has to do it.
trade assignments with me. - No.
you're in a bad mood because your crappy boyfriend didn't invite you to the gala.
but you know what's gonna make you feel better?
spending a night on the peds floor...
with all of the delightful little children.
or I could just punch my crappy boyfriend in the junk.
why not both?
Shane, trade with me. - I'm a surgeon, not a babysitter.
me either. Why do I get screwed? - Cruel twist of fate?
it's just the two of you down here tonight, so if you find yourselves in over your head, call a grown-up.
Kepner, kid in bed 8 has abdominal pain and vomiting.
if C. T.'s negative, give him fluids and send him home.
don't we look spiffy. - Yeah, I do.
you look like crap.
I haven't had a chance to freshen up yet, you ass.
watch your back! Coming through! - Holy heck.
Hey, what's the story?
once upon a time, three idiots got wasted - and ran their car into a tree. - They're drunk?
no, high as kites.
lucky they were the only ones that got hurt.
Hey, Sinatra, I'll give you a fiver for a glass of wine.
sir, what'd you take?
it's heroin. Add a tox screen to their trauma labs.
what's your name? - No I. D. on any of 'em.
we've been going with John, Jerry, and Jake Doe.
cute. - Okay, let's hustle, get a full trauma workup so I can get upstairs and run a brush through my hair.
Meredith Grey, as I live and breathe.
I haven't seen you in ages. How's, uh...
Derek liking maternity leave?
he's on paternity leave.
Yeah, okay. - We have a deal.
I don't work. Neither does he.
it's working out well.
I live in your house. You're bored out of your minds.
Yeah, they've got all this pent-up surgical energy and now everything's a competition.
it is not. - And he's winning.
he is not winning.
he couldn't even get Zola to put her shoes on tonight.
I did that. I got her to put her shoes on.
so I'm winning.
I need to come back to work.
that's the creepiest waiter I've ever seen.
Bailey's gonna lose her mind. She can't stand clowns.
this is gonna be hilarious. - Bailey's not coming.
What?! Wait, we can do that?
I'm going home. - Wait, nobody's going home.
spread the... word.
Derek is really good at this kind of thing.
I should get started before he does. - Oh, I think he already has.
amazing.
I have to confess something. I know who you are.
I saw your video from the T. E. D. conference and I just... I'm sorry. I'm a little starstruck.
Really?
yeah... you know, I go every year, and...
so many of the talks often focus on the tech you spoke from the heart. you might be surprised...
the truth. You're an inspiration.
if I lost my wife in a plane crash...
Oh, I'm sorry. What?
your wife. She... passed away, right?
yes... she did.
it's...
it's been really hard.
you and I have to join forces so that Derek does not win Avery's money.
prison's changed you.
we are in trouble.
Avery bet the farm on this party.
listen to you two.
this is not that difficult. Just be charming.
use the same skills you would if you were picking someone up at a bar. I know you know how to do that.
and you need to practice if we're gonna get serious about meeting new people.
you need to let that go. - Ooh, Richie Rich, 10: 00.
Mr. Steers, I know this is hard to hear, but the P. E.T. scan showed your cancer has spread.
I'm afraid surgery is no longer an option.
I'll tell you what's hard...
this pillow.
we've talked about this.
victoria is from the Philippines.
that's what I said. - No, it isn't!
okay, fine.
so no surgery. What's that mean?
more chemo? What's the next step?
um, these are brochures from several local facilities that can help ease you into the final stages.
when you're ready, we can talk about which might be the best fit.
best fit is gonna be the one with topless nurses.
I don't need any of that fully nude business.
they don't serve booze at the joints where the girls ditch their skivvies.
matter of fact, how about I slip you a tenner, you slip me a bottle of somethin'?
I'll call if I start to feel weepy.
what are you doing? - Eating shrimp at a party.
I just spent 20 minutes talking to donors about you when they'd prefer to be talking to you.
you need to... Alex...
have you been listening to me? - I gotta get some air.
where the hell are you going? - Hey, Jackson!
champagne?
this is amazing!
Oh, the magician... incredible. - This is warm.
Oh, yeah, big bird said there's no ice.
we have some back at the hospital.
they can bring a patient's temperature down in minutes, right?
no reason those can't chill a bottle. - That's ridiculous.
then it's on theme for the night.
and I can't leave.
um... could you please run back and grab 'em?
fine.
though, honestly, that story I don't think is, uh...
appropriate. - Well, I'll tell you what, chief.
I'm gonna take a walk over to that table,
well, now I want to hear that story.
Oh, chief of surgery.
I wasn't sure when I got a load of the clowns.
Oh, come on. Clowns are great.
people love clowns.
you worried me there for a second.
Oh, really?
Hey, um... buy you a drink?
isn't it an open bar? - The price is right.
okay. - Thanks.
what was that? - What was what?
that whole sparkly eye thing.
well, I can't help it if my eyes have a natural sparkle.
you were flirting. I don't know what you're talking about.
go juggle some balls.
you just brought a knife to a gun fight.
do you need a hand? - No, no. Um, I'll be fine.
grab these.
cool.
Jake's febrile and he's got a crazy-high white count.
you factor in the heroin, and we're probably looking at endocarditis.
and I think he's got a pericardial effusion.
so he could tamponade at the drop of a hat.
and there's another multiple trauma on its way in.
this is like medical whac-a-mole. I love it.
great, uh, what about those guys?
uh, they're pretty banged up, but nothing we can't handle.
great. Good. Uh, keep it up.
nothing we can't handle? - We've been preparing for this all year.
they have their party tonight. This is ours. Enjoy it.
Oh, he's bleeding from his chest tube.
did you check his coags? - Uh, they're still pending.
uh, get me a petroleum dressing and some gauze!
and call X-ray to get here stat!
doctors! Incoming!
you want to call someone, or do you wanna be a rock star?
I want those trauma rooms ready for action.
anyone who can be moved, move them!
we need all the empty beds we can get!
Hey! You heard her. Lock and load!
okay, let's move!
I know, look. - Isn't that something?
you pulled a sleeping baby out of day care to do your dirty work?
you're disgusting. - He's got his mother's sparkle.
Hello, baby.
Oh, and he's hungry.
convenient.
he's my guy.
I'm gonna kill you dead.
Oh, you're under a lot of pressure at work.
lots of late nights and weekends.
but still, you stay active. Lots of, uh, physical activity?
you can tell all that from my pulse?
sure... and the way the tux fits.
Oh, my, this watch is gorgeous.
it's vintage. It was my father's, actually.
he, uh... he... he would wager watches. - Mm-hmm.
and so he won this one. - You know, you need another one.
I'll be right back.
there is a gal over there doing close-up magic.
you have to see it.
Emma Marling, this is Dr. Cristina Yang...
our best cardio fellow. - How's it hanging?
go on. You're missing the magic.
whiskey soda. - Coming right up.
you are barking up the wrong tree with that one.
you're never gonna get a donation out of her.
those shoes... outlet mall all the way.
you want...
that.
what... that old lady?
that old lady in Chanel. - Here you go.
thank you.
go get 'em, tiger.
it was a beautiful service, but after...
little Sofia just kept asking...
why is mommy not coming home with us?
you are so strong.
no, it's...
really, it's my work that's kept me strong.
this... this hospital, you know, these...
these people. - That's beautiful.
where can I make my donation? - Right over there next to the stairs.
the nights are the hardest, though.
I know exactly what you mean.
ever since Harvey died, I can't fall asleep in our bed.
I spend all of my nights on the couch...
with the cat.
exactly.
wait, what?
what is the matter with you?
I-I know this is a difficult time, but you cannot talk to my nurses that way.
your move. - What?
I figured out your problem. Your mind is all closed off.
Oh-oh, my mind is closed?
here... I figured you'd want to play black,'cause, well...
you know.
if there was anything I thought we could try...
there is.
make a move. - Yeah, I have other patients.
I-I can't just stand here and... - What would Rosa Parks say?
excuse me? - Or Martin Luther King?
you think they would just stand over there and make excuses like you are?
you people are supposed to be tougher than this.
I'll have a counselor come by - and talk to you about the brochures. - Oh, I see.
you're giving up on me because you don't like the way I talk.
you're just gonna let me die 'cause I offend you.
I am trying to give you the best care I possibly can despite the fact that you offend me.
you are rude and demeaning, and I am still trying to help you move on in the most comfortable way possible.
I am not going to move on.
I'm not gonna pass away or go to heaven or make a journey home.
I am going to die.
my lungs are gonna deflate.
I'm gonna lose control of my bowels.
my tongue's gonna roll to the back of my head.
I am going to be dead.
there's no making it sound nice or pretty.
it is not good. I am going to cease to exist.
and I don't want to. I am not ready.
so get off your ass and do something!
what the hell are you doing?
he needs a pericardiocentesis. - Yeah, we can't just do that.
stop! I'm calling someone. - Not yet.
Shane! - Not yet.
this is really very sweet of you.
but you know, you don't have to...
you don't have to sit here with me.
I don't mind.
I just...
I can't stand the way she looks at me, the way that everyone looks at me.
uh, no one's looking at you. - Please.
I grew up gay.
I know what it feels like when people are staring.
you're missing a leg, and they stare.
and everyone knows you're a cheater, and they stare.
and they talk, and they judge, and they... stare.
like that. - What?
c-come on now, you were telling a story. - I know...
I know how you must feel about me.
and I know you try and hide it, but I can see it on your face.
what do you think you see?
you know...
Jesus.
Oh, come on.
Oh, what, to be... it's... I-I'm incapable of empathy because I go to church? What is that about?
I can empathize like nobody's business, especially with a cheater.
you're right.
I'm sorry.
thank you.
I'm sorry for calling you a cheater.
I am, though.
I know.
she stared at me, too.
but the way she stared...
felt... really, really good.
you know?
actually, I do.
and then...
he chainsawed his leg off.
but that's not even close to the strangest thing I've seen.
though, honestly, I'm not sure that story is appropriate.
gentlemen, that story's gonna have to wait.
okay, I look forward to it.
I've been watching you. - Oh.
chatting up our donors, stealing my stories.
you're a thief. - You've been watching me?
Mm-hmm. Who are you?
Dr. Emma Marling, maternal-fetal medicine, Seattle Pres.
after that storm, we've been hurting, too...
badly.
I've been pushing our board to throw a fund-raiser for weeks, and I can't get any traction. So here I am...
borrowing yours. I'm not a thief.
you stole my story. - It's a good story.
I don't get this. You are here to get donations, and you spend all this time talking to me.
you-you want me to say it?
I mean, look at you.
impressive party.
another whiskey soda.
that's your fifth one.
who are you, my mom? I'm not drinking.
gotta stay sharp.
this is for the C. F.O. of A. E. C. interactive.
got him on the ropes.
every drink he knocks back is another "zero" added to the check
I collect at the end of the night.
that sounds wrong.
right and wrong don't live here, son.
this is the wild west.
this is so much fun!
it's like when we were interns...
stealing surgeries, playing dirty.
I don't really get to do that anymore.
does this look stupid?
the kid spit up on my dress, and in my dress...
all over, really.
Oh, for the love of god, Mer. You're making it so easy.
every night, Harvey would whisper,"I love you" into my ear just as I was falling asleep.
it's been ten years since, and still, every night, I feel like I can hear his voice.
do you ever feel like that... like she's still with you?
all right.
can I have your attention, please?
Oh, speech! Speech! Everybody, hush up!
Oh, sorry. He's gonna talk now.
thank you. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I am Dr. Jackson Avery.
and on behalf of the board of Grey Sloan memorial hospital,
I just want to say,"welcome."
thank you. Thank you.
thank you very much.
now over the past year, we have seen many changes, from a change in name to a change in leadership...
and it has all been a challenge.
thank you.
as surgeons...
wait!
was that part of it? - I don't think so.
Oh, no, no, no! You need to stop.
you could have internal injuries or breaks.
um... I think I'm okay. See?
I'm okay. I'm fine.
so, yeah, I'd say there's a break.
what's the update on those paramedics, Avery? - Should be here any minute.
no pulse. Okay. Hold still. This is gonna hurt.
do you think he's watching? - Who?
Richie Rich. 'Cause we look freaking amazing right now.
Cristina, gross!
edwards, someone better be dying.
I'm really hoping to avoid that, Dr. Yang.
Ross is doing a pericardial window in the E. R.
okay, when he aspirates the fluid, get him to the O. R. I'm on my way.
go. We got this. - This way, guys.
where are you going? - Oh, back to the hospital.
some junkie with endocarditis is tamponading. - Which junkie?
there's more than one?
it's all about forgiveness. Mm-hmm.
and that's... that's what's important.
you... he... he sees me for who I am.
and he accepts me for what I've done.
but that's... that's everything.
are we talking about Matthew or Jesus?
Dr. Robbins? - Yes!
you paged me...
to a closet? - I need you to run across to the gala and grab a bottle of champagne because - we're low. - We are low.
and snacks!
screw this day. - Uh, thank you, Murphy.
thank you.
you think Callie's ever gonna forgive me?
probably not.
she's telling everybody at the gala that you're dead.
you know, we're about ready to roll.
Hey, I'm coming, too.
how are we doing on our fund-raising goal?
Oh, we're not even halfway there.
well, then you've got plenty to do here.
I'm worried about internal injuries.
make sure they rush her to C. T. -All right.
you're not coming?
we're on maternity leave. We have a deal.
Mer, let's go. We need all hands on deck.
let me go!
let go! Dr. Webber... please!
Dr. Webber... - Oh! I-I can take it from here.
I can take it. - Let go!
I don't want this.
there's a man down the hall. He is ornery.
he's a jackass. He's dying.
and he won't stop fighting, even though there isn't anything I can do for him.
and then I've got you.
you've got a million options, and you refuse to try.
you have atelectasis.
you are in danger for pneumothorax pneumonia, R. D. S.
and Meredith Grey is ready to let you slip into a coma.
but I am not! You breathe in through this, your lungs get stronger, you get better.
it's damn simple math.
what do you wanna do?
this is dumb. Put this on. Put... - No! No!
just... Richard! - No.
get the hell...out!
let's take him off bypass and see how we did.
everything okay, Dr. Yang?
pericardial window is a pretty risky move for an intern.
I... I didn't have a choice.
the fluid was too thick for a pericardiocentesis.
you had a choice.
you could have called someone the minute he tamponaded, but you didn't.
you basically got to do a surgery in the E. R.
and now you're up here with me, while Edwards is down in the pit.
you're a shark. - I'm not! I swear.
Ross, it's a good thing.
all great surgeons are sharks.
you see what you want and do whatever it takes to get it.
like me. And never apologize.
sharks don't apologize.
monitor. - Here you go.
Where's that coming from?
it's coming from inside. That means we have two options.
one... we can put him back on bypass, undo all our work, and find the source, or...
two... I take a guess, throw in a U-stitch and hope I don't shred the heart in the process.
Dr. Ross, what do you think?
sharks don't swim backward. Only forward... or they die.
option 2 it is. 4-0 prolene.
here you go.
there it is.
what's supposed to happen?
if it worked, nothing. If it didn't...
lots.
that'll do, sharky. That'll do.
Murphy, those aren't for you. - Yeah, I know.
have you seen my wife?
uh, she, uh, hopped on a rig with the paramedics.
question of the night!
you know, I should be at work right now.
you know, Stephanie doesn't realize how lucky she is.
she should be thanking you instead of being pissed at you.
Yeah. Wait, what?
she wanted to come tonight? - She bought a dress.
she never said anything. - Of course not.
if she had to say something, it wouldn't mean as much as if you'd had the idea on your own. - Oh, my god.
my head hurts so much. - It doesn't matter now.
the party died the minute the aerialist fell on big bird.
people see a woman's tibia impale her own foot, it's hard to steer the conversation - in a different direction. - They're gonna be fine.
all right. There's a hospital right down...
down the street.
you know what? Ladies and gentlemen!
folks, wait a second.
Dr. Bailey?
Dr. Bailey, please?
what do you need?
I haven't played chess in a year.
I can't keep having this fight, Gene.
no, I know. I just...
the guys at the park stopped letting me play.
cause of the things I say.
I'm not trying to offend you.
that's not true.
I said a couple of those things on purpose.
so... I'm sorry.
you don't have to play the game, but please...
I'm scared.
I don't have anybody.
I don't want to be alone.
what are you doing?
repairing a gastric rupture. It's fun.
you can't just decide to operate.
Derek, you're better at charming the donors than I am.
I admit it. You can have it.
we had a deal. - You're more than welcome to come and join me.
come get a little blood on your hands.
I'll even let you hold a retractor.
all right, I'm gonna change.
Oh, this is really, really fun, and I needed fun.
me, too.
can I try on your leg?
I was cornered by the widow amos...
who was, you know, actually a widow.
her story was so sad, and she took out her checkbook, and I...
Ugh, I'm so gross.
Yeah.
I sort of get it, though.
Really? - Mm. This stuff...
it's not easy.
and Cristina... she keeps pushing me to date.
God, I can't even think about that.
Yeah. You really can't keep telling people that she's dead.
I know.
doctors, we have visitors.
what is he up to? - I don't know.
okay, now if you'll notice the pins that Dr. Torres is drilling into place... that is the external fixation - I was telling you about. - Are-are we allowed to be here?
Yes, I spoke with Irina's husband.
he said that if there's one thing that she believes in, it's that the show must go on.
now we showed you guys a circus tonight.
but this... this is the real show.
this is what we do here.
we are gonna get this woman back on her feet.
and then before you leave this evening,
I would ask that you please consider helping us get back on ours.
how much do you need?
I usually have really good radar for this crap.
what are you talking about? - What the hell is this?
Oh, that's not funny.
don't freaking joke like that. I don't do that.
I'm just trying to do a freakin' blood draw.
Why? - I think my dad's in the hospital.
I don't understand what that means.
I don't know. I can't...
I haven't seen him in 20 years.
and this guy... some old junkie...
crashed a car, has no I. D., he's ragged, wrecked.
but his voice in the E. R... Guy called me Sinatra.
it was like somebody poured ice water down my neck.
that feeling hasn't gone away.
so this is a paternity test? - I don't know.
no.
I thought I could live the rest of my life and never see him again.
I don't want it to be him.
if you take the test, then you'll know for sure.
if it isn't him, then that feeling will go away.
I guess that's true.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
you know, I'm actually pretty smart.
you'd know that if you tried talking to me instead of ditching me at fancy parties.
I'm sorry. - Yeah.
okay.
that surgery was incredible.
I haven't felt this relaxed in months. - Me either.
what? - Reminiscing.
about?
you, me, an exam room, and your panties pinned to a bulletin board.
Oh, the prom.
except you didn't have blood on your suit, - and I wasn't wearing a sweatshirt. - I think it's sexy.
now you're doing the sparkly eye thing.
I have no idea what you're talking about. - Mm-hmm.
is it working?
Hey, hey! What... what's this?
you're getting a roommate.
gene, Richard. Richard, Gene.
calm down, dick.
the way you look, can't imagine you're gonna be around much longer anyway.
these are a few options for facilities that assist with end of life care.
since you two are in the same boat, figured you could go through them together.
crack a window when you go.
smells like something died in here.
Jake's in the I. C.U. Should pull through.
how are things down here?
Oh, you know...
only amazing.
I cannot believe I was in such a snit over not going to a stupid party.
I mean, I have done burr holes, a crike, and I pulled a hunk of glass this big out of a dude's face!
you were totally right. I am a rock star.
you are a rock star. We are rock stars.
we're not rock stars. We're sharks.
we're rock sharks!
okay, then.
I heard you were here. I just wanted to, um, - catch you before you leave. - Here... here I am.
I like the blue. - Oh, thank you.
there are more zeroes than fit in this little box.
let's get outta here.
to... uh, where?
come on. Don't be coy.
you like me.
there's no way this was all about the money.
no, it was all about the money.
you flirt with me all night, get me to write this big check, - and then nothing? - Yeah.
and you don't feel even a little bit bad about that?
no.
that's actually even hotter.
you have a good night.
it doesn't have to be all about money.
you could sleep with me for free.
I have to talk to you.
look, I don't know what happened... - Oh, would you stop?
I've been here too many times, honestly.
I'm too old. I'm too busy to be playing games with you.
I'm not playing games.
you're pissed because I didn't invite you to this stupid thing, and now you're getting back at me with Ross.
that's not true.
Oh, you're not pissed at me? - Yes! I was. Yeah, I was, okay?
you threw a party, and you didn't invite me.
so yeah, my feelings were hurt a little bit.
but that has nothing to do with what happened in the E. R.
Ross kissed me.
I don't know where it came from.
I did not ask for it.
I swear.
fine.
fine? - Yeah... fine.
and this wasn't a party. This was work.
nobody wanted to come. I never thought you did.
if you and I are gonna do this, you've gotta start talking to me.
no more getting mad and then waiting to see if I know you're mad - or any of that. - Yeah, okay.
I didn't want him to kiss me.
I want you to kiss me.
look at this.
sunshine and daisies and friggin' bunny rabbits.
could be worse.
you could die in that bed...
in this room.
this hospital could be the last place you see.
you don't want to die here.
no. I don't.
it is a pretty lawn.
if I gotta kick, could be nice to do it outside.
the food's gotta be better than what they serve here.
I wouldn't feed that slop to a gypsy.
I said "I wouldn't." I was being nice.
Hey! Are-are you gonna head back up the street?
uh, no, I was just heading home.
listen, I don't blame you for not wanting to get out there and date. People are...
gross.
but we look great. So you wanna go hit Joe's?
Oh, sorry, am I interrupting? - You're here?
Yeah, I... uh, really, uh, had a good excuse all worked up, and now I'm completely blanking.
I was just heading home.
it was really nice to meet you.
you, too.
good night.
overture, curtain, lights.
I have the results.
this is it...
the night of nights.
I don't wanna know... - He's your dad.
what?
Oh, my god. I jumped the gun.
I am sorry. I am so sorry.
shotgun! I get car sick in the back.
Ugh, I might get car sick in the front.
thank you.
I'm about to take my intern exam, which means I am about to be a second-year resident.
my babysitting days are done.
you're adorable.
excuse me.
no more rehearsing and nursing a part.
we know every part by heart.
Ross, what's going on? - Multi-car mash-up in the E. R.
be a shame to wake the kids.
tonight, what heights we'll hit. On with the show.
this is it.
I'm Dr. Grey.
the 7 years you spend here as a surgical resident will be the best and worst of your life.
you will be pushed to the breaking point.
eight of you will switch to an easier specialty.
five of you will crack under the pressure.
two of you will be asked to leave.
Dr. Shepherd, we should pretend it never happened.
what never happened -- you sleeping with me last night, or you throwing me out this morning?
you're an attending, and I'm your intern.
stop looking at me like that.
like what?
like you've seen me naked.
your first shift starts now and lasts 48 hours.
you're interns, grunts, nobodies, bottom of the surgical food chain.
what are you doing here?
you and I are gonna have so much fun together.
you know Meredith is inbred?
like it's uncommon around here to be a doctor's parents.
no, royally inbred. Her mother is Ellis Grey.
shut up. The Ellis Grey?
she's a living legend.
what's your name?
it's me, mom -- Meredith.
all right.
we're gonna survive this, right?
it's all about lines.
the finish line at the end of residency.
waiting in line for a chance at the operating table.
and then there's the most important line
the line separating you from the people you work with.
it doesn't help to get too familiar to make friends.
you need boundaries between you and the rest of the world.
other people are far too messy.
it's all about lines.
drawing lines in the sand and praying like hell no one crosses them.
look, I'm sure you're very nice, but I'm very particular about who lives in my house, and you're just not right.
Why? Look, I'm quiet. No loud music, no parties.
where were you when the challenger exploded?
the what?
the space shuttle challenger.
uh... I think I was in kindergarten.
exactly. No.
why do you put up posters for roommates if you don't want roommates?
I do want roommates. We're together 100 hours a week.
you want to live together, too?
I see you bring bribes now, huh?
my mom irons my scrubs. I have to get out of there.
it's not a bribe. I don't think it's a good idea.
I can put down last, first, and deposit. - It's totally a bribe.
I can cook, and I'm an obsessive cleaner.
no. I just want two total strangers who I don't have to talk to or be nice to, and it's not a bribe. It's a mocha latte.
George, you're running the code team. Meredith, take the trauma pager.
Christina, deliver the weekend labs to the patients.
Izzie, you're on sutures.
Dr. Bailey, I was hoping to assist you in the O. R. today.
maybe, do a minor procedure, I think I'm ready.
mocha latte?
if she gets to cut, I want to cut, too. - Yeah, me too.
I wouldn't mind another shot. I mean, if everybody else is...
stop talking.
every intern wants to perform their first surgery.
that's not your job.
do you know what your job is? To make your resident happy.
do I look happy? No. Why? Because my interns are whiny.
you know what will make me look happy?
having a code team staffed, having the trauma pages answered, having the weekend labs delivered, and having someone down in the pit, doing the sutures.
no one holds a scalpel till I'm so happy, I'm Mary freakin' poppins.
mocha latte, my ass.
why are y'all standing there? Move!
Seattle has ferryboats.
Yes.
I didn't know that.
I've been living here six weeks.
I didn't know there were ferryboats.
Seattle is surrounded by water on three sides.
hence the ferryboats.
now I have to like it here.
I wasn't planning on liking it here.
I'm from New York.
I'm genetically engineered to dislike everywhere except Manhattan.
I have a thing for ferryboats.
I'm not going out with you.
did I ask you to go out with me?
do you want to go out with me?
I'm not dating you, and I'm definitely not sleeping with you again.
you're my boss.
I'm your boss's boss.
you're my teacher and my teacher's teacher.
and you're my teacher.
you're sexually harassing me. - I'm riding an elevator.
look, I'm drawing a line.
the line is drawn.
there's a big line.
so, this line, is it imaginary or do I need to get you a marker?
we'll talk later?
are you the surgeon? - Yeah.
we've got a rape victim. - Better get in there.
25-year-old female found down at the park. Status -- post trauma.
she came in with a gcs of six. B. P. -- 80 over 60.
exam is significant for blunt head trauma.
unequal breath sounds, right pupil is dilated, and she's ready for x-ray.
ready to roll?
Hey!
Yeah.
call ahead to clear a C. T. Let them know I'm coming.
load up the portable monitor.
call respiratory for a ventilator.
I'll get x-rays while I'm down there.
she's gonna spend a hell of a long time in recovery and rehab.
if she survives.
what is she, like 5'2," 100 pounds?
she's still breathing after what this guy did to her?
if they catch the guy, they should castrate him.
see how shredded her hands are?
she tried to fight back.
tried to? Rape kit came back negative.
she kicked his ass.
so, we have a warrior among us, huh?
her -- her name is Allison.
I think I may have found the cause of our rupture.
more suction.
what is this?
does anyone know what this is?
Oh, my god.
what? Spit it out, Grey.
she bit it off. - Bit off what?
that's his... penis.
she bit off his -- his penis.
if she can fight the infection, she'll be fine.
it's all gonna depend on whether or not she wakes up in the next 72 hours.
yo, we should get a drink later.
you can tell me the long story of what makes a hotshot doc leave the big apple for Seattle.
short story, actually.
your chief of surgery made me an offer I couldn't refuse.
richard asked you to come?
Yeah. Why?
Oh, nothing.
see you later.
do you know what the code team does?
saves lives.
I shock a heart, and someone lives to see another day.
that's upbeat.
Bambi, don't say another word till after the hunter shoots your mother.
I don't like you.
I have a B. A. from Smith, a PHD from Berkeley, and an M. D. from Stanford, and I'm delivering lab results.
it's gonna take me all day to get through these.
then get started.
Oh, I wasn't complaining.
intern was reassigned, so he's mine now.
have him shadow you for the day.
you show him how I do things.
Alex Karev. Nice to meet you.
you're the pig who called Meredith a nurse. Yeah.
I hate you on principle.
and you're the pushy, overbearing kiss-ass. I hate you, too.
Oh, it should be fun, then.
I'm Dr. O'malley. I'll be running this code. What do we got?
we have a 57-year-old gentleman with asystole.
three and four. - Charging to 200, please.
charging. - Cleared.
all right, Mrs. Lu, I'm Dr. Stevens.
I'm gonna sew up your wound.
you're gonna need -- yeah -- about six stitches.
are you allergic to any medication?
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't -- Do you speak English?
I'll find, um
does anybody here speak Chinese?
Hi. - Is the chief in?
he's on his way.
is that it?
Yeah.
can I see it?
no. Forget I asked.
Meredith, it's good to see you.
Hey, I heard your mother was leaving Mayo.
she going back with the U. N?
she's, uh, taking time off.
to write another book, I suppose.
listen, so, they said to bring this to you, so
Yes, uh, for the police.
right.
when did the police say they were coming?
you know how slow they are, so she better take it with her.
what?
you have to take it with you.
Chain-of-custody rules.
all medical matter in a rape must stay with the person who collected it until it's placed into police custody.
you collected the specimen, so you have custody.
custody of a penis.
Yes, until the cops come for it.
okay.
well, what am I supposed to do with the penis?
you have a disorder called multinucleate cell angiohistiocytoma.
it's not a cancer sarcoma.
it's very rare but minor.
you'll be discharged today, okay?
I don't need a surgery?
no.
I'm not gonna die? I'm fine?
fit as a fiddle... or whatever.
what's that?
don't ask. You don't want to know.
I do want to know.
really.
you really want to know?
it's a severed penis.
okay.
I didn't really want to know.
why do I have to be the one who gets hugged?
because -- I don't do that.
besides, you're the ovarian sister here.
did you call me an ovarian sister-- an ovarian sister
since when does the possession of ovaries become an insult?
Meredith's carrying a penis around in a jar.
Oh, from the rape surgery?
Yeah, and it's not a jar.
it's a cooler.
talk about taking a bite out of crime.
you okay?
Yeah.
Allison's shoes are... - What?
the rape victim, Allison, her shoes.
I have the same ones in my locker, and I normally never wear them because they're not comfortable.
but today I did.
and she was wearing the same shoes, and it's just...
stupid, and I'm tired, and forget it.
you know what you need?
it's sick and twisted.
we said last time was the last time.
you've been doing it without me?
Nancy Reagan lied.
you can't just say no. Come on.
do you know what would happen if anyone knew?
I'm doing it.
you can come with me, or you can stay here and be miserable.
you are such a woman.
that's a code.
I got to go.
you are really cute.
what are you doing in here?
there-- there were no tests ordered, and the baby has a murmur.
I know.
he turned blue.
you're surgery. You're not authorized to be in here.
do you know how much trouble you can get into for this?
are you going to do any tests?
it's a benign systolic ejection murmur.
it goes away with age. - So you're not gonna do tests.
he's not your patient. He's not even on your service.
are you sure it's benign?
I'm a doctor, too, you know.
you should get out of here.
you get a good case? - No -- her.
she won't let me sew her up.
I wouldn't have called you, but I can't get ahold of the translator.
can you just ask her what's wrong?
no.
why not?
because I grew up in Beverly Hills.
the only Chinese I know is from a Mr. Chow's menu.
besides, I'm korean.
chief.
so, you asked Shepherd to come to Grace, huh?
he was an old student of mine.
he left a Manhattan private practice because you asked.
Yes.
no other reason?
just a favor for an old professor?
it'll be years before I retire. - Chief of surgery is mine.
chief of surgery is mine.
it was yours. Now I'm not so sure.
I am the best surgeon at Grace with the lowest mortality rate.
you can't just bring -- - Now ask me why I'm not so sure about you.
ask me why.
don't people get sick anymore?
I mean, how are we supposed to get any O. R. time if everyone's gonna just live?
look.
I'll take 10, you take 10.
get in, get out.
no smiling, no hugging, no letting them cry.
just be quick about it.
you're the one that's slow.
I am not slow. You are slow.
you want to bet?
Yeah, you're on.
a comprehensive workup... - ...did not reveal any...
...abnormalities. - Your doppler was negative.
...for venous thrombosis so there's no need for chronic...anticoagulation or an oral...
the biopsy was, however, positive... - ...for a mixed anaerobic...
...non-group-"a" streptococci infection.
your B. U. N. and creatinine elevations had us worried...about rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis...
...which could have signaled an autoimmune disease.
what does that mean?
we're not gonna amputate your leg.
you get to keep your kidneys. - Congratulations.
you can go home today.
Yeah, yeah. Congratulations. Whatever.
Congratulations.
there's nothing wrong with you. You're gonna be fine.
Congratulations.
what's your favorite '80s group?
no.
twisted Sister. - Oh!
it's not like there's a right or wrong answer to that question.
the Go-Gos, Duran Duran, The Eurythmics.
have a nice day.
you can go home today.
time of death -- 15: 45.
man, I've called every hospital in the county.
I don't know. Sooner or later, the guy that did this is gonna seek medical attention.
when he does, that penis you're carrying around is gonna nail him.
where is her family?
doesn't have any.
no siblings?
no.
both parents are dead.
she just moved to Seattle three weeks ago.
welcome to the city.
Meredith, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just have to do something.
I have to go.
all right. I'm gonna sit with her.
there's a baby up in peds. I saw him have a tet spell, and I think I hear a murmur.
hmm. Did peds call us for a consult?
actually, no, they're not -- - So you want me to what?
if you could just go up and look at him. - Not without a peds consult.
I'm a busy man, Grey, and there are rules.
look, it's not like I'm the chief or something.
you're hot.
you're drunk. Hold still.
wait, you're that
that girl from the magazine.
the red bikini.
Yeah, it was pink.
I'm done. You can see the nurse outside now.
is she crazy or something? - I don't think so.
please. Please sit down. I really need to look at your arm.
okay.
what are you doing down here?
just sitting here with my penis.
what about you?
hiding from Alex.
I kissed Derek.
you kissed Derek?
in the elevator.
Oh, you kissed him in the elevator?
I was having a bad day.
I am having a bad day.
this is what do you do on your bad days -- make out with Dr. Mcdreamy.
well... you know, that and carrying around a penis just makes everything seem so shiny and happy.
george said Allison was wearing your shoes.
Yeah.
it's weird, right?
it's weird that you care.
I think it's weird.
can I have security, please?
what do we got?
take a look. - What?
uh, let's get him to O. R. 1.
Meredith, you call the chief and let him know we got the rapist.
I saw Allison.
you can't believe the beating that she took.
and then to see this.
why are we not attempting to re-attach the severed penis?
teeth don't slice. They tear.
you can only re-attach with a clean cut.
if she wanted to slice him off with a knife...
besides, the digestive juices didn't leave much of the flesh to work with.
right. So, what do we do?
sew him up minus a large part of the family jewels.
and his outlook?
he'll be urinating out of a bag for a very, very long time.
not to mention he'll never be able to have sex again.
Oh, too bad. - Shame.
let's all take a moment to grieve.
clamp.
we got the rapist.
he stumbled right into the hospital.
Yeah, I heard.
listen, Burke - Why?
you really want to know?
I want to know when you stopped thinking of me as your number one.
Richard, I do more in this hospital than - You do only exactly as much as is necessary.
you never take an extra step.
you never give an extra minute.
you're comfortable and arrogant, and it doesn't impress me.
you want to be chief?
earn it.
I'm sorry. I have patients lined up.
I don't have time. I don't understand you.
I'm sorry.
my head hurts.
maybe it's a tumor.
you wish I had a tumor.
look, I'd rip your face off if it meant I got to scrub in.
I've been suturing all day.
my hands are numb.
at least you're helping people.
at least you get to practice freakin' medicine.
I had to send my Chinese lady away.
she was, like, camped out down there.
Oh, poor Izzie, turning away patients. Boohoo.
so the police say they can't send a crime-scene guy down for hours, so I have to spend the night with the penis.
Alex, don't say it.
it was too easy anyway.
who here feels like they have no idea what they're doing?
I mean, are we supposed to be learning something?
because I don't feel like I'm learning anything.
except how not to sleep.
it's like there's this wall. The attendings and the residents are over there, being surgeons, and we're over here, being...
suturing, code-running, lab-delivering penis minders.
I hate being an intern.
is he yours?
he's adorable.
Thanks.
Oh, please.
you are so out of line.
she says the murmur might not be benign.
I think we should do an echo to check.
this is your career.
there really is no reason to get alarmed.
what's the problem?
if our baby is sick, we want him treated... now.
who said your baby was sick?
the surgical intern, who has no business on our service.
who authorized you being here?
I was just - I did.
can you excuse us for a second?
are you messing with my intern, Dr. Kay?
no, sir.
give me the chart.
there's nothing wrong with him. I checked.
are you sure? - Yes.
you can guarantee he's fine? You're 100% sure?
how sure are you?
I don't know, 75%?
not good enough. He's my patient now.
that okay with you, Dr. Kay?
Absolutely.
he can take our patient?
he's an attending.
which means I can do whatever I want.
Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, I'm Dr. Burke, head of cardio.
we're gonna run some tests and give you an answer within the hour.
Grey. Excuse me.
I want an ekg, chest x-ray, and an echo.
I don't have all day.
you're a busy man. - I'm a busy man.
anybody else?
no. No more. - I need a bed.
ms. Lu?
ms. Lu!
ms. Lu, wait! Ms. Lu!
what is it?
Oh, my god.
it's okay.
it's okay.
I'll help.
it's deep.
it's deep -- I need to clean it out.
machine broke in the factory.
fall.
you speak english.
just -- if you could come inside.
no, no, no inside. No... jail.
jail?
she came inside.
she green card.
me, no.
you're illegal.
that's okay. We don't have to tell them that.
I just need to get you inside. I have to sew that up.
no inside.
please, I promise. I promise you won't go to jail.
just -- it's raining. Please come inside.
okay, okay, okay.
not inside.
uh... wait here, okay?
wait. I'll come back. I'll be back.
well? - It's a birth defect.
tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary atresia.
you were right. I'm booking the O. R. for tomorrow.
thank you for backing me up on this.
wait. Whoa.
you were right.
but if you ever pull a stunt like that again
going to the parents behind a doctor's back, trying to steal a patient from another service
I will make your residency here hell on earth.
three, four, five. Breathe.
charging to 200, please.
four, five. Breathe.
damn it.
okay. You're all sewn up.
that's pretty good.
I could've done a better job if I'd had more light.
you might have a scar.
it is good.
you're gonna need to come back in five days.
okay? I'm gonna need to check the wound and remove the stitches, okay?
so, uh... here's my pager number on this card.
right here, okay?
we'll meet right back here, okay?
you have to come back.
but you can't tell anybody that I helped you outside of the hospital, or I might lose my job.
understand?
Yes. Come back and don't tell.
Yes.
okay, that's it. I'm done. You can go.
I'll see you in five days.
see you.
thank you.
do you think I'm too confident?
no.
don't lie.
you are my boss.
all right, then. Anything you say in the next 30 seconds is free, starting now.
I think you're cocky, arrogant, bossy, and pushy.
you also have a god complex.
you never think about anybody but your damn self.
but I --- But what? I still have 22 more seconds.
I'm not done.
I need a drink, a man, or a massage.
or a drunken massage by a man.
what's wrong with you?
I lost five patients on the code team today.
I feel like the angel of death.
George, 95% of all code patients can't be revived.
most of them are seriously dead before you even get there.
what?
why didn't you tell me that when I was going on and on about how great it was gonna be?
because...
you're George and I'm Cristina.
his heart surgery is scheduled for the morning.
I really did think I was right, you know?
I know.
we almost never are.
we're interns.
we're not supposed to be right.
and when we are, it's completely shocking.
are you
I mean, being an intern, do you feel
terrified.
100% of the time.
good. It's not just me.
no.
how is she?
no change.
have you been here all night?
Yep.
you know, I have four sisters.
very girly. Tons of kids.
if I was in a coma, they'd all be here.
I'd want them here.
not having no one?
can't imagine that.
I can.
what are you talking about? What about your mother?
she'd be here ordering all the surgeons around.
she'd fly these cowboys in from prague to do these amazing medical procedures.
that's true.
I do have my mother.
so we're kissing, but we're not dating?
I knew that was gonna come up.
don't get me wrong. I like the kissing.
I'm all for the kissing.
more kissing, I say.
I have no idea what that was about.
is it gonna happen again? 'Cause if it is, I need to bring breath mints.
put a condom in my wallet.
shut up now.
there's this baby up in the nursery.
he's brand-new.
no one's neglected him or damaged him yet.
how do we get from there to here?
she's wearing my shoes, and someone's beat the crap out of her.
and she's got nobody.
her icp's doubled. Get O. R!
prep for craniotomy.
let's hang a mannitol, uh... take a blood gas.
Hey.
I, uh, had to leave her skull flap off until the pressure in her brain goes down.
she's not gonna make it, is she?
she's gonna be fine.
if she ever wakes up.
if she ever wakes up.
I'm off at 6: 00. You want to get that drink we talked about?
I don't think so.
well, what about tomorrow night?
shepherd, you should know that Richard promised chief to both of us.
but you knew that already.
keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
you're not the enemy.
you're just the competition.
so, here is where you have the signature, and down here, the initials.
okay.
it just says that the, um... the...
penis.
look, I'm a doctor.
I mean, it shouldn't be weird to say this.
it's just that I used to change her diapers.
I get it.
it just says that it was never out of your sight.
here we go. One penis.
officer.
we'll be using a median approach for a transventricular repair with a right ventriculotomy.
let's open him up.
open. The 10 blade, please.
Yes, sir?
go scrub in. When we're finished cracking the baby's chest, I'll let you hold the clamp.
Seriously?
don't make me change my mind.
I'm going.
I have good news and bad news.
the good news is Dr. Bailey stopped the bleeding.
the bad news is we've given your penis to the cops.
have a nice life.
the results of your labs are clean.
the tumor is benign. You can go home today.
Oh, you...
at some point, you have to make a decision.
boundaries don't keep other people out.
they fence you in.
life is messy.
that's how we're made.
okay, fine, George and Izzie, you can move into the house.
Yes! - I can't believe you caved!
thank you.
I can't believe I caved.
I blame the babies.
they make you toxic.
so you can waste your life drawing lines...
...or you can live your life crossing them.
welcome back.
...but there are some lines...
so, it's intense.
this thing I have for ferryboats, I mean.
...way too dangerous to cross.
I'm so taking the stairs this time.
no self-control.
it's sad.
really.
here's what I know.
if you're willing to take the chance...
the view from the other side...
is spectacular.

testing, testing. Is this thing on?
okay, Jenna, I think it's time you come up here. Come on.
Vicky, Rashid, Brody, come on. All of you, get up here.
come on down. Front and center.
all right, this woman right here has made us all very happy.
do you know how much money this game is going to make?
to Jenna.
to Jenna!
thank you, but it wasn't just me. It was my team.
you were with me through all the doubt and the long nights.
I couldn't have done it without you guys.
but before we take all the credit, I just have to say...
when most of us were still in diapers. You are an awesome boss.
you trusted me... us...
with the sequel to your flagship game at this company.
and we thank you for that.
all right, all right, all right. This calls for an awesome toast.
to Jenna.
this is an awesome toast!
we're being so bad.
we shouldn't be doing this.
Oh, yes, we should.
wait, wait. Shh.
someone's here. Yeah. Me.
Oh, please, don't do that. Please, don't do that.
no, someone's in here. - So?
we're at work, Brody.
we're not working now. Jenna, come on.
better not be you, Rashid. I'm going to kick your ass.
Brody? What are you doing? Brody?
where are you?
UNKNOWN.....
Vienna, AUSTRIA
how's IT GOING?
we NEED TO TALK.
when?
tomorrow NIGHT.
it IS WORTH THE RISK?
your BROTHER IS STILL OUT OF THE COUNTRY. THIS IS MY ONLY CHANCE.
I'll CONTACT YOU WHEN I'M HERE.
if anybody wants to talk, any spirits or whatever,
I'm home. I'm available. Now is your big chance.
I can't help you unless you contact me.
okay?
okay, thanks. Now I'm just talking to myself.
well, then... oh, look at that. Still doing it.
victim is Brody Crawford. 26, spinner employee.
here for a party, along with most of the employees.
the body was found by Jenna Marshall. She's in the bathroom with an officer.
cut in two. You don't see that every day.
looks like he was burned, cauterized. With what?
some kind of chemical. Maybe acid.
and then there's this little postcard from the edge.
some kind of invitation? - For who?
maybe for the person he killed. Not going to be much competition now.
or maybe for somebody in the company. Could be for a friend or a lover.
or us. If this is a game, it's got some badass rules.
nobody went home after work. We all stayed for the launch party.
we're going to release the sequel to our black forest game.
what did Brody Crawford do for you?
software engineer, like most of them. Brilliant kid.
I snagged him right out of carnegie-mellon, pissed off a lot of people at E. A.
I just can't...
who didn't Brody get along with?
well, there's always friction in a creative business, but not so much you'd kill somebody.
I mean, Brody got along with everybody. Clearly, not everybody.
look, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, everybody works in teams.
Brody's team was responsible for the black forest sequel. And who else was on Brody's team?
uh, Jenna Marshall is the team leader.
and, uh, Vicky Edwards and Rashid Raju are also on the team. They all worked on the code.
what's the code do? It's a monster breakthrough.
it allows more players to occupy a single space at the same time.
right now, online games can only handle so many players in one area before the program slows down or crashes, but Jenna's code allows our game to host hundreds of players in a single location without any of those problems.
so more players can play together at the same time.
that's the idea. Which means the value of that code goes far beyond any game.
it's a new platform standard.
I mean, it's a game changer.
then we're talking about some big money. Yeah, the kind wildest dreams are made of.
and who shares in those dreams? Me.
uh, and everyone else on the team. I mean, the company owns the intellectual property, but they've got some pretty big stock options coming their way.
what was the relationship between Brody and the rest of the team?
there was something going on between Brody and Jenna...
I mean, I warn everybody not to fish from the company docks, but they're young.
and as long as they get the work done, I stay out of the way.
but, uh, anything beyond that, you're going to have to ask Jenna.
we'd been going out three months.
and, um, it was a party, we were drinking, and Brody wanted to go someplace more private so we could...
celebrate?
I heard something. I thought somebody was in the room with us, and I didn't want anybody to see us like that, so I left.
and then I heard something fall. That's why I went back.
and what about this message? "Play my game"? Does that mean anything to you?
I don't know. I don't know.
play my game"? I don't know what the hell it means.
it's just sick.
was there any jealousy between your team and the other employees?
we're all competitive. Everyone wants credit.
at the same time, if one of us does well, we all do well.
can I get that?
people are wondering how long we're going to be here, when we're going to be able to go home.
put it on speaker.
spinner. This is Vicky. Play my game.
Oh, my God. - What do you want?
play my game.
extension 1211
it's coming from inside the building. Where's extension 1211?
that's Brody's office, downstairs.
the suspect's in the building.
clear.
clear.
secure perimeter. Suspect may have left the building.
copy that. Perimeter secured.
get the surveillance. - Yeah.
what do you got? Brody's I. D., cut in half.
and title page to Alice in wonderland.
someone wrote "what's" on it.
a Connecticut yankee in king Arthur's court.
let's see what's behind door number three.
rage. Richard Bachman.
you put it all together, you get "what's my name?
surveillance cams run 24-7.
covering all entrances, exits, hallways, until 9: 15 P. M., when they were all remotely shut off, 22 minutes before the 911 call was made.
so our killer got in and out without being recorded. Yeah, looks like he planned it that way.
how'd he tap into security? - Techs are working on that.
clearly this guy... and I don't mean that in a gender-specific way... is a tech head.
do we have a murder weapon? Not sure what it is.
well, Vic was cut in half. We'll know more after the M. E.S take a look.
and what about these messages? "Play my game," "what's my name?
don't know. Could be he's just playing with us.
that's great. So we've got our very own zodiac killer here in Portland.
it looks like he chose three specific books, or maybe their authors.
fortunately, I've read all three.
And? They're all fantasy.
could be a connection between the stories and the black forest game. I'm all over this.
I've done my fair share of gaming, since my life consists mostly of myself and my cat.
well, get on it.
am I the only one who thinks this might be wesen?
maybe we got lucky this time, and we're just dealing with a normal human psychopath.
one can only hope.
head to toe, or side to side? - Side to side.
no, I haven't actually heard of a wesen that does that.
now, drawn and quartered, that's pretty standard when it comes to dispatching wesen.
I mean, it's old school, venerable, but one of the classics.
is this yours? Yeah. Where's the other one?
dude, I am not my sock brother's keeper.
okay.
so there's no wesen that slices people in half using acid.
you mean he was on acid? No, he's using acid. Like, to cut with.
that's kind of nasty, don't you think?
Hey, by the way, have you spoken to Juliette at all lately?
no. Because, I must say, you appear to be handling it pretty well.
I mean, that's gotta be...
well, you are a Grimm, so I guess you're used to a certain amount of pain and suffering.
look, I miss her.
but until she misses me... yeah.
no, you can't beat the heart on the head, so to speak.
but listen, long as you need a place, you got a place.
well, I got an early clock fixing, so I gotta hit it.
that's your towel.
Burkhardt. - This is Dominick spinner.
sorry to be calling so late. I've just been trying to figure out who'd do this.
you know, maybe it's somehow my fault. I don't know.
anyway, the reason I called...
there was another guy. Ridley Cooper.
he was going out with Jenna before Brody, and I'm just thinking, maybe their breakup wasn't so good.
Ridley Cooper. Got it.
where can I find him?
I'm not scared.
okay, I'm a little scared, but I'm not going anywhere.
what's wrong? What are you trying to tell me?
no, don't... no, don't go.
don't leave, Nick.
damn it.
Ridley Cooper? - Yep, that's me.
I'm Detective Burkhardt, and this is Detective Griffin. We need to ask you a few questions.
um, okay. About what?
uh, this is my sis, Debra. Debra, these are Detectives.
cool. What did you do?
what makes you think I did anything? Well, I didn't do anything.
we just need to know where you were last night.
here. Online.
for how long? Most of the night.
we were testing black forest 2. That's what we do. We test video games.
just because you were online doesn't mean you were here. You could have logged on and left.
if we were completely brain dead. Logging into the game and then leaving would've made us sitting ducks.
we're level 49 wizard badgers.
they kill us, they get our powers, our weapons, our level experience...
and we'd have to start all over.
if you want proof, you can call the company. They have our game audio.
which is? - Voice recordings.
us playing. Shows we were online last night.
why are you even here? You never said what this was about.
you know Brody Crawford?
Yeah. He was my girlfriend's... ex-girlfriend.
he works with Jenna at spinner.
sometimes we go on missions together in black forest.
he's a pretty good player. Almost as good as me.
what did he do? He was found dead last night.
wait. What, like dead in real life?
is there another way? Brody's avatar was killed last night.
his character in the game got obliterated. How?
another player cut him in half. What time was this?
uh, about 6: 00 P. M.
I remember it because Debra and I were so happy. About his death.
not his real death, game death.
after everything that went down between me and Jenna, it just seemed like... poetic justice.
you have to understand. He took my girlfriend.
but I would never kill him for real, only in the game.
but I didn't do that either.
6: 00 P. M., that puts it a little over three hours before he was killed last night... For real.
do I need to add that? Who killed Brody in the game?
only the best player on the planet.
nameless. - That's his name?
in the game. Nobody uses their real names.
I can show you. But we were just about to ransack Campolongo castle.
more important things right now, Debra.
how do we find out who that is? Are you kidding?
that's like asking who's God. Or if there's an end to the universe.
or why are we here? - All right.
it's impossible to find this guy. Especially if he doesn't want to be found.
I got a theory. Interested? Yeah.
what is the common denominator of these three pages?
they're paper. - And?
they're fiction. - Getting warmer.
I have an idea. Tell us what the hell you're talking about.
Aw, you are taking all the fun out of it.
but all three of the authors aren't using their real names.
each has a nom de plume... a pen name, pseudonym, whatever you want to call it.
okay, I know mark twain is Samuel clemens.
and Richard Bachman is Stephen king. That's right, I took English lit.
Lewis carroll was Charles dodgson. All right, so this is part of the game of "guess my name.
and we just found out in the black forest game his nom de plume is "nameless.
Oh, guess he put a lot of thought into that one. All right, so where do we go with this?
the killer had access to spinner. He knew about the party, and he killed one of the designers.
all right, we'll start with them. And we need to get into that game, find "nameless," and put him under surveillance.
we're gonna stake out a character in a video game?
Yeah, we find out when he plays and who he eliminates next... could tell us who he's going to kill next.
virtual stakeout. I like it.
I had it in my attic, part of my great-grandfather's collection, and I just thought, you know, it looked like it belonged here.
it's a Gustav Becker double weight vienna, around 1870.
case is superb walnut.
you know, Becker got his big breakthrough in 1852, at the Silesian clock fair.
he won the gold medal for best design.
you sure you want to give it to me?
Yeah. I do.
it'll feel right at home here.
thank you. - You're welcome.
Hi. - Are you okay?
uh, not really.
but the visions are still happening, but they're getting clearer, and last night, I actually saw Nick.
Wow. What did he look like? He looked wet.
I mean, as if he'd been standing in the rain. But he was trying to tell me something.
you know, the night that Nick brought you over to my house...
the night you went into the coma... it was raining kind of hard, and you guys were actually both, like, soaked.
do you think my memory is coming back?
it sounds like. - Yes.
all right, we gotta tell Nick. No.
there are things he does not want me to know, and I am not going to let him stop me from finding out.
and you know things that you're keeping from me, too.
what can we do?
I was thinking maybe if you come to my house if I see something,
I can tell you guys what I see, and then you guys can tell me what it means.
look, I don't think this is...
Monroe, I need help. I really do.
but if you don't think you can for whatever reason, just tell me now.
you're here. - Yes.
is it safe? - I believe so.
I'll text you when and where. ?????????
black forest is a vast world with multiple levels.
I mean, at any given moment, there are thousands of people playing.
if "nameless" is playing, I can track him using his log-in. But, uh, how does this help?
he killed Brody in the game three hours before he killed him here.
can you get an I. P. address for his computer if he's playing?
Yeah, but that doesn't mean I can tell you where...
hold on. I've got him.
level three, at the castle of the black stag. There he is.
whoa. He just cut somebody in half.
who? - Miller's daughter.
can you find out who that is? I know who it is.
Nameless" just killed Vicky Edwards in the game.
I'm dead?
I don't believe this happened. I don't believe this happened.
how'd I let this happen?
yeah? This is Detective Burkhardt.
where are you? At home.
we need officers sent to 612 Northwest Thurston. Officers are on their way to your house.
I want you to lock your door, close and lock your windows.
why, what's happened? You might be in danger.
just stay calm. We're on our way.
Vicky... - Have you guessed my name?
please. I don't know.
who is this?
that's the whole point. Keep trying.
Vicky is dying to show you the next clue.
why are you doing this? Why?
Hey. - Have you seen her?
no, door's locked. We tried front and back. She may be hiding in the closet, for all I know.
I'm not surprised. We probably scared the hell out of her.
Burkhardt. - He called me.
he's done something to Vicky. You have to get over there.
secure the area.
send officers to Rashid Raju's and Jenna Marshall's.
have them picked up, brought to the precinct.
Yeah. We got a 55 Adam. Need an M. E. and CSU.
at 612 Northwest Thurston.
copy that. Will advise.
what the hell is that? Sudoku puzzle.
I'm beginning to hate this guy. "Guess my name.
guess MY NME
anyone know what to do with it? Me.
I haven't had a sleepover since I was a kid.
thank you guys for doing this.
Hey, how did you meet Nick?
uh, under not very good circumstances.
my brother was murdered. I'm so sorry. I-I didn't mean to...
it's okay. I was up in Seattle.
I had to come down and deal with it all. Nick was the Detective on the case.
he caught the men who killed my brother. Actually, that's how I met Monroe.
Yeah. She kind of saved my life.
with a brick.
there he is.
he's right there. Do you see him?
um you're sure it's Nick?
what's he doing? You really can't see him?
we don't have to. Just tell us what you see.
I think he's looking for something.
looks like he's turning a page.
it's... it's a book. He's looking at a book.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't go.
he's gone.
how's it coming? - Done.
the highlighted numbers are 3-1-2-1-9-1-5.
not latitude or longitude.
doesn't work as a phone number, too short for a social security number.
could be an address. The numbers could correspond to letters.
awful lot of possibilities.
what about a date?
3/12, and then we got 1915 on the end.
so someone pissed this guy off 98 years ago?
or it could be a time. It would be 7: 15 military time.
so we might have a date and a time. But not a place.
maybe we're not supposed to know. But the killer called Jenna.
I don't understand why this is happening.
does this mean anything to you?
mm, no. Why?
Jenna, do you remember doing anything on march 12th at 7: 15?
not that I can think of. Nothing you were scheduled to do?
maybe a birthday? Deadline?
I used to be so good at these things.
I think I got something.
what? - Noms de plumes.
the title pages of the books. All the authors didn't use their real names.
so what does that mean? It's the place that goes with the date and time.
what place? - Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. It was a date. I think I know who this is.
who? - The I. T. guy.
the I. T. Guy?
nom de plumes was the name of a restaurant he asked me to go to.
so we were behind deadline.
Brody, Vicky, and Rashid said we were never going to get it done in time.
and then my computer broke down, so we called our after hours I. T. company, because it was, like, 3: 00 in the morning. They sent someone over. It was him.
and how does the restaurant connect to this? He agreed to help me if I'd go out with him.
but it didn't happen. I'm... I'm afraid I stood him up.
so what's his name?
I don't really know. I didn't pay that much attention to him.
do you remember his first name?
last name, anything at all? Um, it was something weird.
began with a "t," I think. Do you remember what he looked like?
I... I don't really remember. I don't think I looked at him more than once.
we were exhausted. We'd been up for 48 hours straight.
he kills your friends because you don't go on a date with him? It just doesn't make any sense.
unless he helped you write the code.
did he?
when he fixed my computer, he saw the code, and he said he could fix that, too.
but I didn't really listen to him.
I-I don't know, I think I passed out for a while. We all did.
and when I woke up, he was gone, and the code was kind of... Done.
so this I. T. guy whose name and face you don't remember actually saved your ass.
no, it wasn't just me. It was all of us.
at first, everyone was so happy, and...
and then there was all this money coming our way.
and the more credit I got, the more I forgot about him.
well, he didn't forget about you.
we're going to put you in a safe house.
you sure it was a book? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was pages, As if he was reading.
could you tell what kind of book?
it looked old. Could you see what was on the pages?
it wasn't printed. It was writing and a weird, creepy drawing.
the trailer. He's gotta be in the trailer.
what trailer? - Aunt Marie's trailer?
uh, well, I'm not really sure whose trailer it might have been under the ownership of...
you know about it?
probably no more than you. What's aunt Marie's trailer?
old books, bottles, drawings...
that's where I was the night all of this started.
I feel like I'm so close to remembering.
do you know where it is?
huh? The trailer? Yes, the trailer.
if I could get into it, then it might help me remember what I've been seeing.
why don't you want to tell me? It has something to do with that night, doesn't it?
I know you're trying to protect Nick, but we have to help her.
look, there's no guarantee that going to the trailer is going to help.
can we at least try?
I would have to talk to Nick. I'm talking to you, Monroe.
I can't live like this. I can't keep seeing things.
I can't keep hearing voices.
if I can't fully remember Nick, then I am just going to forget him altogether.
lotus CAFE 8 PM
take me to the lotus cafe.
the I. T. guy we're looking for isn't employed by the company Jenna called.
he's an independent contractor, works the late shifts.
did we get a name? - No.
no address or social security number. No phone numbers we can track.
he hacked into the system, and somehow, his billing address isn't connected to his phone.
even though they admit it's a working number. This guy is totally working the system.
how's he get paid? How's he pay his rent? He does everything electronically.
every time we turn a corner, there's another corner, only it never leads to him.
so what does?
its stomp can cause the earth to shudder beneath him.
its muscles secrete a highly concentrated acid, allowing them to burn and slice through their victims.
sounds like our guy.
that is one ugly fuchste-whatever.
fuchsteufelwild. - Great.
so now we know what he is. How does that help us find him?
look at all these weird names.
no wonder she can't remember his name.
looks like all the names use the same group of letters.
one "n," two "t"s, two "l"s, two "I" s... so the names are riddles.
seems like they've been playing games long before there were computers.
I'm guessing his name uses the same letters.
Jenna said it started with a "t.
so where'd you get these letters?
it's a compilation of letters of the names of killers used in similar cases, dating back a long time.
okay, so what do you think we're going to find? The killer's name.
should start with a "t." Okay.
anagrams, here we come.
okay, so looks like we have 221 possibilities beginning with a "t,
starting with "tinkles mil spurt
and ending with "tike sprint mulls.
we have to match one of these names with a player used in the black forest game.
you're going to need access to the game's servers for that.
sorry this is taking so long, but 221 names to check against the thousands playing...
we have a match.
what name? Trinket Lipslums.
no wonder he has issues.
how do we draw him out? We need to get into that game.
I can do that. - Yeah, but not from here.
Hi, Jen. So good to find you. It's you.
it's me. - Why are you doing this?
don't you know? Please don't hurt me.
have you guessed my name? Because time is running out.
we had a deal. One you failed to keep.
I know who you are. - Really?
I don't think so. If you did, you'd say it.
you mean trinket Lipslums?
so game over, ass-wipe.
nameless IS DEAD
this game is not over.
good to see you're still alive. Good to be that way, too.
I have to catch a plane tonight. We don't have much time.
I'm supposedly in venice for the weekend, staying at the Cipriani.
bruening is there in my place.
how is he? - Nervous.
an appropriate response, considering the state of things.
so where is my brother expanding his influence to now?
in guangzhou, home in two days.
why are we here?
???????????? The situation grows worse.
the governments are full of cabals, and cabals within cabals.
no one knows precisely who is controlling anything anymore.
but we now suspect your brother and the other six families are behind an effort to force the dissolution of the union.
we have secret documents of their plans to take the reins of power by any means necessary, if the legal means fail. Hmm.
so the chess game begins. The names of those involved are encrypted.
we've identified alliances and backing.
the most important thing for us is to remain strong, and make no compromises that might weaken our relationship with the resistance.
that relationship makes me very uneasy. Some die under torture, others talk.
no one really trusts Meisner and the methods he formulated during his vagabond days in vienna.
what he wants is to strengthen his own position, never mind ours.
we need Meisner. At least, until we don't.
they're disguising what they really want, which is an end to democracy and a return to the imperialist power with all their old privileges restored.
what?
get down.
move!
move it! Move, move!
come on! - Get down.
police. Stay back.
???????????????
AERYSUN_NAMELESS IS DEAD!
Jenna. Did you think you could win?
police.
no more games. Get down.
he's on the move! He's going up. I'm on him.
Where's Vicky's room?
he's going up the fire escape.
Lipslums! How did you guess my name?
it wasn't a guess. - He has a few books.
it's not going to work, fuchsteufelwild.
I hope you don't mind my pronunciation.
I can't lose. I can't lose!
uh, a little help down here?
what's wrong? Juliette remembers seeing you.
well, that's a good thing, right? Not finished.
she remembers seeing you in the trailer, and now she wants me to take her there.
you told her you know about the trailer? By accident.
she was, like, seeing something, and it turned out to be you in the trailer, okay?
and it just... it got away from me. I told her I had to talk to you, okay?
that didn't go over so well. Well, just tell her you can't take her there.
she told me if I wouldn't help her remember you, then she was going to forget you, once and for all.
and how does she think she's going to do that?
by leaving Portland. For good.
why are we here? Someone outside the family is carrying royal blood.
what do you suppose a royal offspring would be worth?
you're in my way. I said, you're in my...
someone died in that bar fight? Why didn't you tell me?
you didn't know what you were doing. You weren't yourself. - That doesn't matter.
if I killed somebody, I have to turn myself in.
now, you want to turn yourself in, go ahead, but you're going to do it alone.
I feel fine. - You didn't look fine.
I'm serious. You're seeing a doctor.
tis Death's Park, where he breeds life to feed him. Cries of pain are music for his banquet.
Nick, I'm gonna increase the speed, see if we can get your heart rate up.
how do you feel?
just gonna increase the speed some more. Really would like to get that heart rate up.
no matter how fast I had you running, your heart rate and your blood pressure hardly moved.
okay. - Either the machine is broken, or you are in incredible shape.
either way, I... until we know if it's working properly, I don't know that we can count on the test results.
was there a problem? I don't think so.
from the looks of it, if there's an error, it's in your favor, but has there been any change to your diet or your lifestyle recently?
well, work has been a little stressful.
well, just take it easy. I'll call you when I know more.
Thanks. - All right.
this is a really good Pinot noir.
can't go wrong with a willamette valley wine, which, for my money, beats the pantalones off any of that French cote d'or stuff.
well, good choice.
so I was thinking...
you know, just thinking, um, well, out loud, now...
that, uh, Nick's back with Juliette, and you're still renting your brother's old apartment, - which is a great apartment. - Uhhuh.
I'm not saying it's not.
on the other hand, um, you know, a house, like mine...
this is a petit beef and truffle tartlet, compliments of chef ostler.
thank you very much.
bon appetit.
that is fantastic.
Oh, the good old days. Okay, uh...
no time to fall off the meat wagon now.
I'll save you.
anyway, my house has a lot of closet space.
Yes.
which means that I think you could totally...
have more room, in my closets, than in your apartment.
you want me to move my clothes into your closet?
okay.
you're really gonna make me work for this, aren't you? I'm kind of enjoying it.
Yeah, I've been thinking that we should...
you know, maybe think about moving in together.
I've been thinking about that too.
because I love you.
well, that's a relief...
because I love you too.
Sam! Hey.
it's been a while. - Yeah.
Oh, you remember Kimber? - Of course. Hi.
this is Rosalee. Rosalee, this is Sam and Kimber.
Hi, nice to meet you. - You too.
this was my great-grandfather's.
Monroe made it work like new. That is a real beauty.
it's one of the original chronographs.
got a second button, to zero out the stopwatch, and a 30-minute elapsed time function.
it's very rare. - The man is a genius.
well, finding the parts was the real challenge with that one, so...
anyway, I just wanted to say hi.
enjoy your dinner. It was nice to meet you.
you too. - I'll call you.
sounds good.
so... - So...
the doctor said it could be the machine. Nick, I don't think it's the machine.
I checked your pulse the night that I thought you were dead, and it was so slow, I could barely feel it.
so what does that mean?
I think it means that whatever you ingested is still affecting you.
Rosalee did say that you're probably gonna react differently from anybody else. I think she's right.
well, how am I gonna explain that to the doctor? I mean, you kind of can't.
all we can really do is monitor you and hope that this is temporary.
and what if it isn't? What if this whole thing just starts happening again?
Hey, will you just sit?
we don't know what's gonna happen. I mean, how do you feel?
do you feel any different?
a little.
more aware, I think. More in control.
but maybe that's just because I know something happened to me, and I'm just paying more attention to everything.
well, what I saw was very, very real, so I'm just not gonna let you go very far for a while.
I think I feel better already.
okay, well, it's gonna take some time to get there.
uh don't get comfortable.
lock up the area. We're on our way.
on our way to what? Little picnic in the woods. Dead body in a tree.
in a tree?
that's what they said.
how the hell did he get up there? Maybe he was trying to escape a bear or a Mountain lion.
I don't know that I'd climb a tree to escape a bear or a Mountain lion, but there was no sign of either anywhere in the area.
that's why we called you guys. Well, whatever got him, got him up there, because what was inside of him is right below him.
Oh, boy.
well, he's been up there awhile... the blood's dry.
it looks like he's got a wallet in his back pocket.
let's get some photos, and let's get the body down.
where ARE YOU
the POLICE ARE IN ERIC'S STUDY
what HAVE THEY FOUND?
nothing THAT I KNOW OF YET
is THE FAMILY COOPERATING?
Yes, AS FAR AS THE AUTHORITIES KNOW
but THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF INFIGHTING, AS YOU'D IMAGINE
I FEAR THING ARE GOING TO GET BLOODIER BEFORE SOMEONE TAKES THE PRINCE'S PLACE
what DOES THE FAMILY THINK HAPPENED
they DONT KNOW, NOBODY DOES
some THINK IT'S THE RESISTANCE, OTHERS THINK IT'S ANOTHER FAMILY
no MENTION OF MIESNER?
not YET
now THAT ERIC'S GONE, FRAU PECH WILL BE LOOKING TO MAKE A DEAL WITH SOMEONE ELSE
I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HER
I THINK ITS TIME YOU DID
I WILL
I HAVE TO GO
Hello, Sebastien.
how are you holding up?
not very well. You?
this is all so shocking. - Oh, it's terrible!
do they know anything about who did it yet?
not that they're telling me. - Are we in danger?
I think it is safe to assume that we could be, and you should behave accordingly.
who's gonna take Eric's place?
the last royal standing.
Yeah, that's him. Name's Ned Klosterman.
lives in Portland.
ironically, he's an organ donor, although I'm not sure who'd want what's left.
I'll run the name.
someone must have ripped him open. Yeah, or took a chain saw to him.
everything seemed fine. He went to work, and so did I.
did you talk to him during the day?
no, we were both pretty busy.
what time did you get home?
I got home around 6: 00, and, um, he normally gets home by 7: 00.
and when he wasn't home by 8: 00,
I called his work, and they said he left early.
so when he didn't come home, I called the police.
was everything going okay with your marriage?
Yes.
it was great.
we celebrated our fifth anniversary two nights ago.
we went out to dinner.
any problems that night? No.
we were happy.
we were really happy.
do you know anyone who would want to harm your husband?
just please find who did this to him.
what are you doing? This.
you're bleeding! - What?
on your arm!
you're in my way.
problem?
Yeah.
the man I killed, Mitchell zinc, I... - accidentally killed.
well, that's not the point.
I killed him... - Yeah, I know.
and you're bothered by it.
Yes, I am.
I'm beginning to remember.
let me ask you something, Nick.
what's really bothering you, the fact that you killed somebody or the fact that you killed somebody who wasn't wesen?
because God knows you've killed plenty of them.
that's what you grimms do, isn't it?
now, excuse me.
I've got a meeting with the mayor.
when you have an answer, let me know.
What'd I tell you about getting too comfortable? I'm not.
good. We got another tree hugger.
this time it's female. We found her car abandoned up on a curb down the way.
door was open, purse was inside. That's her driver's license.
Stephanie Robinson. - This is her work I. D.
she's a sales rep for wilkes medical supplies out of Seattle.
we're pretty sure that's her.
same M. O.
we got ourselves a serial killer here? A completely different kind of victim.
so what's the connection between the two?
besides the tree?
anybody see her climb up there?
uh, even if they did, it's not that unusual in Portland.
Where's the car? This way.
purse is on the front seat. That's where I got her license and work I. D.
other than that, that's how I found it.
got some receipts here.
one from the apple store yesterday, another from target. Two days ago, she went to a spa.
the night before last, looks like she went to dinner at Raven & Rose.
raven & Rose? Aw!
love that place. Chef ostler? Genius.
which is why you can't get a reservation unless you want to eat at 5: 00.
off topic.
parking receipt. - Wait a minute.
didn't Klosterman and his wife have dinner for their anniversary?
Yeah, but we didn't get the name of the restaurant.
maybe the victims knew each other. Well, they couldn't have gone together.
this is dated from last night. But still, they died the same way.
there might be a connection. We should call Mrs. Klosterman.
Mrs. Klosterman, sorry to bother you. This is Detective Griffin.
I just have a quick question.
you went out to dinner with your husband for your anniversary.
what was the name of the restaurant?
raven & Rose. Thank you very much. That's all I needed. Please, do take care.
chef Graydon ostler is "a celebrated, award-winning chef and restaurateur "who trained at the cordon bleu in Paris "and the I. C.C. in Munich.
he has just returned from Europe to open "a new restaurant in Portland.
according to food critic Gustav York, "Raven & Rose is the shining star in his expanding food universe.
food universe." Really?
without a connection between the victims or someone at the restaurant, we have no motive.
we may not even have a murder.
all we have is two people who ate there, climbed trees, and blew up.
that's enough to look at their menu.
ROSALIENGEBIRGE, AUSTRIA - Have you found Frau Pech? - No.
I haven't been able to find her anywhere in Vienna.
I'm in her home. She's not here either.
she could have left Austria, trying to make a deal for the child.
there'll be buyers all over the world for that.
Frau Pech might not have left at all.
I have some notes of hers.
there's one that says, "sacher,
which I assume is the hotel, and then "215," which is probably a room number.
I'm thinking it might be a buyer, or she's making a deal.
find out who's in that room.
I'm sorry, we don't open for another half hour.
we need to talk to Graydon ostler. Oh, no, you don't understand.
he gets pretty stressed just before we serve dinner, so... - No, no, no!
get away from the stove! You're turning my sauce into cheese!
I think we can find him.
back up!
you will destroy my reputation!
how many times do I have to teach you the meaning of cuisine?
this is an art, not carpentry!
get back to your stations, now!
what? - Wesen.
what kind? - Bauerschwein.
ostler? - All of them.
you say they dined here recently? Yes, within the last couple of days.
sorry, I don't recognize either one. What is this about?
well, they both died. What?
you don't think this had something to do with my restaurant, do you?
look, we had the county health inspector here last month, and he gave us perfect scores. Plus, look at my menu.
we specifically ask if you have any food allergies, and we warn against ingredients such as raw eggs and shellfish. No.
we need to know if anybody who works for you knew the victims.
we need a list of your employees, and we need to know what Stephanie Robinson and Ned Klosterman ordered.
that shouldn't be a problem. Neither of the victims ordered the same thing.
Klosterman had osso buco, Robinson had Halibut with huckleberry sauce.
they both ordered wine.
he had Pinot noir, she had sauvignon blanc.
no one on this list has a criminal record, including the chef.
and Klosterman's wife didn't recognize any of these names.
got the tox screens back on your vics. Well, I assume you've read them?
of course. - Then just tell us.
no known pathogens. No known poisons or toxins. You got nothing.
Yeah, nothing except a kitchen full of bauerschwein. We can't arrest 'em for that.
it kind of sounds like an extreme form of gastric dilatation volvulus.
excuse me?
bloat.
dogs get it, cattle get it.
it's breed-specific, so for dogs it would be, you know,
irish setters, great danes, St. Bernards.
what about the volvulus part?
that's when the stomach gets twisted around the longitudinal axis of the digestive tract.
I should ask you this stuff more often. Now, you said it was breed-specific?
so I'm wondering if the victims in this case might somehow be the same breed.
I mean, the kitchen staff was entirely bauerschwein.
well, were the victims bauerschwein? I don't know, and now that they're dead, there's no way to find out, but if they were Blutbaden...
huh. What?
you see, Blutbaden and bauerschwein have been feuding for centuries.
no, but this is a restaurant. Anybody can eat there.
Plus, how would they know they were Blutbaden or what they were ordering?
well, why don't you think about that on your way to Monroe's?
aren't you supposed to be moving out tonight?
or have you changed your mind on me?
no. I'm on my way.
I'll see you soon. And, um, thank you for the bloat info.
any time.
it's gonna be weird not having you around.
I mean, sure, it's gonna be great having my house back, and I did kind of like the odd couple thing.
except, of course, when Rosalee was here. Yeah.
well, I can't tell you how much you helped me out by letting me stay here.
you know what? That whole.
Juliette in a coma and not remembering you and then kind of hating you" thing, just a bad deal.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to rehash. It's just, I'm glad it worked out, for both of us.
I know it wasn't always easy.
well, hey, how many Blutbaden can say they had a Grimm living with them under the same roof?
and lived to tell about it? Right, probably...
none. - None, actually.
I mean...
Yeah.
uh, toothbrush. - Right.
Oh, hey, have you heard about this new restaurant, Raven & Rose?
heard about it? Rosalee and I just ate there the other night.
it is spectacular! I had an incredible vegan sausage cassoulet...
you know it's run by bauerschwein, right?
no, but why should that matter? Lots of wesen own restaurants.
I mean, I would never frequent a place run by a Schneetmacher, or for that matter, that served schneetmacher.
but. - You feeling okay?
Oh, man. I feel great.
well, I think this just about does it.
here, let me help you. - Okay.
Monroe, I thought you said you were gonna give me a hand.
Yeah, I am, 'cause I got... I got the bag.
Hey, could you get the door for me?
you're not actually going anywhere just yet.
surprise!
surprise?
for what? It's not my birthday.
it's for your leaving. - Oh, yes.
and we're pretty excited about it. So my wife baked a cake!
she doesn't need much of an excuse.
bud, this cake is so gorgeous. Where's your wife? With the kids.
somebody's got to watch 'em. God knows what they'll chew up when you're not home.
all right, now, I just want to say, for a roommate who's a Grimm...
and I really mean this...
I'll get it.
so where was I? You were about to tell me how great I am.
actually, I was about to say how great I was for putting up with you, but yeah, you were okay too. Uh, can we get to the drinking part?
Yeah, let's do this. - Yeah!
Cheers. - That's what I say.
Hey, Kimber's on the phone. Something's happened to Sam.
she's calling everyone looking for him. What?
who's Sam? - He's a friend of Monroe's.
I just met him at a restaurant the other night. What happened to him?
he hasn't come home, and he's not answering his phone, so she's very concerned.
okay, this is weird.
Kimber says Sam snapped this morning, that he woke up and his eyes were kind of glassy.
he didn't feel well, but he went to work anyway, and now she can't find him.
and this is not like Sam. Did he eat at Raven & Rose?
Yeah, that's actually where we ran into him.
I love that place. A little pricey but worth it.
all right, is he a Blutbad?
Sam? Uh, yeah, why?
we're working on a case. We've got two dead bodies, and both of them ate at the Raven & Rose in the last few days.
all right, do you know Ned Klosterman or Stephanie Robinson?
Ned, I do, yeah. Why?
they were the two victims.
is Ned a Blutbad? Yeah, yeah, he...
he's one of my old sort of hunting buddies, you know, from...
Oh, my God!
what about Stephanie Robinson?
um, I don't know. I don't know her.
but at least two of the three were Blutbaden. Monroe, we're gonna need Sam's license plate.
we're gonna have to put an A. P.B. out on his car.
uh, right. Okay.
what's going on?
the restaurant is run by bauerschwein, and we think that they're somehow targeting Blutbaden.
Oh, God! Oh, God! This is really bad.
bauerschwein going after Blutbaden? I mean, isn't it sort of the other way around?
you'd be surprised.
I'll... I'll... I'll put the cake in the fridge.
Rosalee, you said that Monroe ate there. What did he eat?
uh, I don't remember.
here's the license plate. Thanks.
do you feel okay?
Yeah, fine. I mean, should I not?
how did they die? It's something similar to gastric dilatation volvulus.
basically, their insides burst.
that sounds familiar. I have to get to the shop.
what?
I knew I knew it.
it's called vollige verzweiflung in German... the black despair mushroom.
it's found mostly in the black forest.
it is similar to a rare strain of fungus called "ophiocordyceps unilateralis from the tropics, "which attacks carpenter ants, causing them to climb into trees "where their insides burst, spreading the fungal spores.
when eaten raw, the mushrooms are harmless, but when cooked, they release a toxin fatal to Blutbaden.
what's wrong? - I'm trying to remember if I had any mushrooms at Raven & Rose.
did I? - I don't know.
th-those could have been in anything. We checked what the victims had to eat.
they ordered completely different things. Is Sam's girlfriend a Blutbad?
uhUh, she's a Kehrseite-Schlich-Kennen. You know, like you and Hank.
she's not a wesen, but she knows the...
wait, whoa! The tartlets.
what tartlets? - The beef and truffle tartlets.
they weren't on the menu. They were compliments of the chef.
everyone got one, except you didn't eat it. Well, no, it had meat.
well, that's how he does it.
serves it to everybody. Only the Blutbaden are affected.
Griffin. Where?
thank you.
they found Sam's car ran off the road in Washington park.
he was not with his car. He's not gonna go far.
I'm going with you. He's my friend.
any sign of the owner? Not since I've been here.
well, that's definitely Sam's car, so he's got to be around here somewhere.
what the hell is that?
Sam. - Stay with the car.
call the paramedics.
there. - Sam?
hold on, man! We're here, we're coming!
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna kill that bauerschwein.
we still don't have any evidence that he knew what he was doing.
he's a bauerschwein. What more evidence do you need?
well, I need something I can take to court. Not this time, Nick.
either you take care of this, or I will. Let me handle this.
I've already lost two friends, man. I am not losing any more.
so one way or another, that pig is going down.
he's not gonna go vigilante on us, is he?
he might.
how do you want to deal with the chef?
excuse me, chef, I hate to bother you, but... but what?
one of those detectives is here again. Where?
too bad you came in so late. You missed a fantastique coq au vin.
there's been another death.
someone who ate here? - Yeah.
I doubt it was anything they ordered. It wasn't.
it wasn't on the menu.
but everybody ate it, compliments of the chef.
Yeah, there's a special ingredient in it, from the forests of Germany.
maybe you've heard of it.
it's called the black despair.
that is absurd!
not for a bauerschwein who's killing Blutbaden, it isn't.
you're a Grimm.
I have witnesses here.
Oh, you mean the accomplices? You're gonna kill us all?
I'm not gonna kill anyone.
what are you going to do? You can't arrest me.
we're simply preparing gourmet dinners, like I do every night.
how do you prove in a court that I was killing Blutbaden?
well, I was hoping you'd confess. Really?
that would be the right thing to do.
let me tell you about the right thing to do, Mr. Grimm.
half of my family was killed by Blutbaden, going back years.
everyone who works for me has lost relatives.
everyone has lost, everyone has suffered at the hands of the Blutbaden!
well - the payback has only just begun.
so this is about the past?
no, no. This is all about the future.
the civilized future, where we are finally on equal footing, where we no longer live in constant fear.
you really think you can hold me responsible for the Blutbaden's own weakness?
I think you'd better come to terms with the new world order.
there's not gonna be a new world order.
not as long as this killing continues.
well, that's an interesting sentiment coming from a Grimm.
I'm sorry, but I need to ask you to leave.
we're closed for tonight, and we have an even bigger night tomorrow night.
even if the chef knew he was killing Blutbaden, you can't prove it. I'm not gonna try.
this Blutbaden-bauerschwein feud has been going on forever.
it's just like the middle east, Rwanda, Ireland.
somebody always has a very good reason for killing somebody they don't like.
well, then how can you stop it? As a cop, I can't.
well, what are you gonna do, kill him?
at's what my ancestors used to do.
that won't stop it.
look, that's not gonna stop it everywhere, but it will stop it here.
and if I don't do anything, Monroe will.
and I don't want him going to jail for murder, 'cause that they can prove.
what?
you're getting that look again.
Juliette, I'm fine.
I've got to go deal with this.
Sam never hurt anybody.
I mean, talk about a decent guy. And Ned's the same way.
I mean, yeah, okay, we hunted a little when we were young, but never bauerschwein. Only the legal stuff.
you need to calm down.
I just watched a friend of mine explode in a tree.
I mean, how are you supposed to calm down after something like that?
I don't want you doing anything crazy. What, you mean like the right thing?
like killing that murderer? Nick said that he would handle it.
how is he gonna handle this?
this is between Blutbaden and bauerschwein. Always has been, always will be.
and if we let them get away with this, man, it is gonna be open season on us!
and what happens when they don't stop at Blutbaden, and they kill a few Fuchsbaus?
then what are you gonna say, huh?
you were right. Chef ostler knows exactly what he's doing.
you talked to him? - Yes.
I thought I'd give him a chance to turn himself in. Oh, I'm sure that went over big.
did he take you up on that? Well, I got the confirmation that I needed.
what good does it do if we know he's guilty?
you can't arrest him for serving something that's only poisonous to Blutbaden.
there's nothing Nick can do, as a cop, anyway! I'm sorry.
somebody has got to put the fear of God into these Schwein!
you do this, you risk everything.
listen to him. - No.
not after what they did to Ned and Sam and hap.
I am not gonna let them get away with it!
Oh, Nick, please, do something.
just after 8: 00 P. M. this evening, in Vienna, Austria,
Eric Renard, crown prince of the Cronenberg family, was killed when his car exploded en route from the Vienna international airport.
no one has yet claimed responsibility for this tragic event.
all of Vienna is in mourning.
yes? - Uh, room service.
for me?
room 215? - Yes.
but I didn't order any room service. There must be some mistake.
magnifique.
that's it. Run, run, run.
Oh, so what shall we serve the Blutbad tonight?
wait a minute. How about the chef himself?
I haven't done anything. Stay away!
I like it when dinner talks back.
No! No, no, please!
get back!
you're under arrest.
you've got to protect me.
he killed my friends!
get down on the ground. Put your hands behind your head!
not until we kill every last one of them. All bauerschwein must die!
don't do this.
don't... don't let him get me.
don't! - No!
you killed him! Thank God!
he didn't give me a choice.
Oh, my God.
you shot him.
kill him now.
we'll shut down his place for good!
they're everywhere. Bauerschwein!
now this feud ends, and it ends now.
you have to get me out of here.
not until you confess to murdering Klosterman, Robinson, and Leoni.
if you don't, these Blutbaden are gonna kill every bauerschwein you know.
kill the hog!
there's nothing you can do to stop us.
guess who's on the menu tonight.
Oh, man. There's a lot of 'em.
we have to start thinking about ourselves here, Nick.
what? No, you can't leave me!
unless you confess... We gotta let nature take its course.
let's go, huh? - Time to die, pig!
you're trapped, pig!
okay, okay, okay! I did it! I confess!
I did it! I killed them!
all right, just get me out of here!
you really think me admitting this is gonna stop something that's been goin' for centuries?
no.
but it's a start.
you know, you connected on a couple of those. Yeah, you too.
he signed it. He did.
and this little piggy went to jail.
more and more she grew to love human beings and wished that she could leave the sea and live among them.
ice-cold beer everybody's here tonight ice-cold beer everybody's here tonight
wow, that was so bad, you guys. I think I threw up in my mouth a little.
we probably scared all of the fish away.
I never catch anything anyway. What, two beautiful women don't rate?
you kidding me? Pretty thing like you, you're not even a keeper.
I should toss you in right now.
so I'm gonna get some more beer.
okay.
that's good.
Ooh, boy.
Oh, what do you want?
no, no, no, no.
you little pervert!
what do you think you're doing?
nothing. I WAS JUST GOING FOR A WALK
you were not just walking around. I saw you spying on us.
I'm gonna tell dad.
no
you CAN'T
if you don't want me to tell him, you need to get your butt outta here.
not HIM
anybody BUT HIM
what do you care about Jake? I mean, he doesn't even know that you exist.
I LOVE HIM
look, you're never going to be the same as them, you know, so you need to stop trying to become something that you're not.
now, go.
what, no beer?
changed my mind.
what's the matter?
you scared of me?
that was incredible.
you're incredible. You're not so bad yourself.
No!
No! Help! Help!
get out of the water! - What's going on?
get out! Help!
well, this is the last of your stuff.
are you sure this is a good idea? Whoa, wait, what?
of course this is a good idea. This is a great idea, - 'cause you and I... - No, no.
what? - Not that.
I'm just... I'm saying I-I have so much stuff, and your house suddenly seems a lot smaller.
no, there's plenty of room. Plus, look.
it's a golden opportunity for me to get rid of some stuff. What are you going to get rid of?
Oh, you kidding? Any number of... like...
or...
you know, like this, for example.
well, that's a start.
this was presented personally to my great, great Uncle Bernard by Sigmund Riefler himself when Bernard retired from the clemens Riefler clock works in Munich.
sigmund was the son of the founder clemens Riefler, but it was actually Sigmund who invented the Riefler escapement, which is a mechanical device for precision pendulum clocks.
and I actually have one right over there.
so...
I think everything should stay right where it is.
even me.
I cut up some fruit. You want some?
Yeah, please, and a lot of coffee.
got you covered.
what?
nothing.
that's what makes this so great.
Yeah, I really missed all this, like, everyday stuff.
I missed that too. See you after work.
Hey, hey, what about the doctor's reports? Oh, he was supposed to send me the email yesterday.
just check my email, see if it came in.
tell me if I'm still alive.
Gillnetter out on government island fished him out of the river this morning.
I cross-checked with missing persons.
a report was filed yesterday matching his description, name listed as Daniel Hopkins.
same as we got. Report also lists as a possible assault.
looks pretty beat up. Probably from river debris.
I don't know about these marks on his ankles. Yeah, same here too, like scratches.
Yeah, scratches or claws. Maybe something pulled him under.
what are we talking, a loch ness monster?
who filed the report? - Uh, Jake Barnes.
filed last night at 9: 15. Let's talk to him.
one second.
Jake Barnes? - Yeah.
I'm Detective Burkhardt. This is Detective Griffin.
you filed a missing persons report for Daniel Hopkins. Oh, God, did you find him?
mind if we talk inside?
Yeah, sure.
so did he make it out?
afraid not, they discovered Dan's body this morning.
Oh, man.
Oh, man, I was afraid of this.
you know, he was... he was pulled underwater.
by what? I don't know, I just saw something, it got me too.
all right, we're gonna need you to go over everything that happened yesterday...
where you were, who was there, anything you can remember.
Oh, jeez. He's really dead, I can't believe this.
all right, was anyone else there with you? No, not at first.
we were fishing up near steelhead, and... and then these two girls showed up.
you get their names? - Mm-hmm. Sarah and Anna.
they were sisters, I didn't... I'm sorry,
I didn't get their last name. You must have got a number, right?
I never had a chance. I mean, one thing led to another.
did things get sexual?
Yeah. Who were you with?
Sarah. Dan was with Anna.
we were all in the river. Sarah and I...
anyway, afterwards, we were swimming, and...
that's when I heard Dan.
he was screaming, and Anna looked really scared, and she was yelling for us to get out of the river, and...
and then something... something pulled him under.
did you try to get to him? Of course, but...
I mean, and then something pulled me under too.
and then that's the last thing I remember.
look, I told all this to the police last night.
I don't think they believed me.
how'd you manage to get out?
I'm not sure.
I mean, all I know is there was this...
this what?
girl, I think, but you know, I mean, I'm not even sure she was real, man.
I mean, I was still just trying to breathe.
it wasn't Sarah or Anna? No, this one was younger, but I don't know, man, I don't know what I saw.
how'd you get those scratches?
I'm telling you, I mean, it felt like something, like, grabbed me.
okay, what kind of something? I mean, it's a little hard to focus when you're drowning.
why don't you take us to the place where this all happened?
my car was parked behind these trees. We came down here and made a campfire.
my clothes were right here, Dan's too. I mean, I looked all up and down the river for him.
I should have gone in after him, but after what happened...
is this where you went into the river? Yes.
and where'd you get pulled out? Down there, I guess.
what happened to the girls you were with?
I don't know, I...
I mean, I thought maybe they got grabbed too, but then their clothes were gone when I came to.
you said there was another girl that pulled you out. What happened to her?
uh, I think she ran off as soon as I was out of the river.
now, when'd you call 911? Soon as I got back up here.
I couldn't find my phone, so I used Dan's.
how'd the girls get here? Uh, just from back there.
you didn't see a car? - No.
police!
stop!
I'm not gonna hurt you!
what happened? She dove in.
you see her come up? - Yeah, about 50 yards out.
she swam all that way underwater? What are we dealing with?
Hey, hey, I think that's the girl I saw when I came up.
Where'd she go? - I'm not sure.
river patrol didn't find any bodies matching Jake's description of Sarah, Anna, or the girl Nick saw jump into the river.
they're probably still alive. Somebody went back to the campsite and took the sisters' clothes.
Jake said they were scared. They probably got out of the river, grabbed their stuff, and ran.
the girl I saw go into the river was a lot more than a girl when she got under the water.
you know what she was? - Not yet.
let's round up the unusual suspects.
sent YOU PHOTO
oui?
are YOU ALONE
I CAN TALK
you RECEIVED THE PHOTO?
the SACHER HOTEL ROOM NUMBER I FOUND AT FRAU PECH'S...
..IT'S ADALIND'S ROOM
she WAS DOING BUSINESS WITH FRAU PECH?
apparently
Frau PECH MIGHT HAVE APPROACHED HER KNOWING SHE WAS A LAWYER FOR THE FAMILY
in ORDER TO GET AROUND ME AND MAKE A DEAL FOR THE CHILD
did MY BROTHER KNOW ABOUT THIS
I NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO TELL HIM
we STILL DON'T KNOW WHO'S SELLING THE BABY
or WHOSE CHILD IT IS
unless ADALIND APPROACHED FRAU PECH TO MAKE THE DEAL
she MIGHT BE THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO HAVE A CHILD WITH ROYAL BLOOD TO SELL
in the river?
you know, I'm not really that much of a water person.
I'm really more of a Mountain and land kind of lubber.
there was this girl I knew in Seattle, she was a naiad, lived out on Bainbridge island.
she's was kind of weird, nice, though.
but she could swim, man, like a fish.
uh, naiad?
Oh, naiads. Yeah, no, I've heard of naiads.
I've never seen one, though. What are they, like, a water nymph or something?
sort of. Very close-knit families. They never stray far from the water.
that's probably why Jake can't describe who saved him. I bet you'd have something about them in your trailer.
well, at least we have an idea of what we're dealing with now.
Yeah.
right, we should be going. Looks like you guys have a lot left to do.
Yeah, we do. We sure do.
Hey, you know, but if you guys need any help, you know, in the trailer...
I mean, I probably shouldn't leave with so much left to do.
go ahead. - Are you sure?
I mean, it's not gonna take that long. Please, take him.
Thanks.
Oh, listen to this, it's dated 1755.
looks like a Grimm working for the East India company.
a strange event aboard the merchant vessel Doddington.
Jory, our third mate, disappeared overnight.
the rest of the crew grows superstitious.
recently, Jory had taken to raving "about a beautiful woman "swimming alongside our ship like a fish.
I have decided to stand the man's watch "as we round the cape "to see if there is any truth to these rumors.
it turns out Jory was no lunatic.
I saw the creature known to my kin as the naiad.
after capturing it in a net, "I was able to haul the creature aboard, "where she donned her human shape.
I find her mesmerizing "and have kept her hidden from the Captain and crew.
after some hours on board, "the woman's skin began to dry and peel.
she begs me to return her to the sea, "but I am determined to prove Jory true.
I have questioned her regarding his disappearance, "but she refuses to betray any secrets of her kind and only pleads to be let back into the water.
at sunrise this morning, the creature died "from what I assume was severe dehydration.
I'm afraid whatever secrets the naiad was keeping have died with her.
it's wu.
got something for us?
we ran the number from Jake Barnes' missing cell phone.
GPS puts it at the andersen marina.
that's not far up the river from where they went swimming.
how you want to handle this? Meet us at the marina.
we should bring Jake along in case he can I. D. whoever took the phone.
you ever been here? - No.
you know anybody who lives here? Not that I know of.
stay in the car. - See if you recognize anybody.
the phone's still on...
in one of these houseboats.
looks like this one here.
sir, I'm Detective Burkhardt. This is Detective Griffin.
we're following up an investigation about a drowning.
need to ask you a few questions. Who drowned?
can I have your name, sir? Abel Mahario.
I don't know anybody who drowned. We're tracking a stolen cell phone.
it was taken from where the victim went into the river.
the signal led us here. Mind if we take a look inside?
I haven't done anything wrong, and I told you I don't know anybody who drowned, so this must be a mistake.
should be easy enough to find out.
calling the stolen cell phone now.
that sounds like probable cause to me. We're going inside, sir.
sir, will you stay right here?
so how'd Jake's phone get in here?
girl on the left looks like the one I chased into the river.
the naiad? - Let's find out.
sir, do you want to take a crack at how this cell phone got in your house?
I have no idea how it got there. This girl, is she your daughter?
Why? Elly didn't do anything.
she may have been in the area at the time of the drowning. We need talk to her, see if she saw anything.
well, you can't talk to her. Sir, this is a police investigation.
she's deaf, so unless one of you can sign...
Hey, Sarah. Sarah.
Sarah, hey. Yeah, it's me, Jake.
Sarah, hey.
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, guys.
guys, guys, wait. Whoa, hold on.
look, they found Dan's body. I don't know what you're talking about.
Dan, he drowned. The police are here.
we have to go. - Wait, I'm sorry, did you hear what I just said?
Dan's dead! Why don't you just leave us alone?
guys, these are the girls I was telling you about. Sarah and Anna.
Sarah, Anna, get in the house.
everyone's gonna stay right here until we're done questioning them.
who was with Dan? - Anna. I was swimming with Sarah.
I don't know what he's talking about. What, are you crazy?
look, we were together yesterday. All right, we're gonna need to see some identification.
my girls didn't do anything wrong. I. Ds.
now, you wanna tell us where you were yesterday afternoon and evening?
we were here with our dad. - They were with me and Dan.
Anna? Hey, what the hell's going on here?
it's a police investigation, sir. I need you to stop right there.
investigation of what?
who are you? - We live over there.
then I suggest you go home and stay out of it, unless you want my sergeant to put you in the back of his car.
I already told you, my girls were home last night.
you recognize this girl? Yeah, I mean, that looks like the girl who saved me.
you want to explain how this cell phone got in your house?
that's my phone. They had my phone?
fine, you don't want to explain here, I get it.
Sarah, Anna, you go back to the precinct with us.
let's go. This way, please.
anyone else want to go?
let's get back in the car.
listen, you can't do this.
sir, we can make the same arrangements for you, unless you want to clear this up right now.
you don't understand.
well, I guess we have more to talk about than I thought.
but I'm going to talk to your daughters first, give you some time to think about it.
damn it.
I told you I didn't want this kind of trouble. Why did you do it?
because you forgot where you come from. We haven't.
I haven't forgotten anything. I know what it takes for us to survive.
your world died 200 years ago, and now you've jeopardized all of us with this fundamental crap!
it was Elly, your daughter. She pulled him out.
which is how that phone got in your house. She has to be cut.
are you crazy? Nobody does that anymore.
where we're from, they do, and we don't have these kinds of troubles.
and this is your fault, old man.
this is what happens when you don't raise your women right.
no, no, wait. Please, she's just a girl.
I'm not gonna let you touch her.
who's gonna stop us?
Jake says this is the girl that pulled him out.
you want to tell us what happened?
we're the only two here who know what you and your sister are.
I don't know what you're talking about. You're naiads.
you really want to spend the next 24 hours drying out in a holding cell?
cause that's where you're going if you don't start talking.
I have nothing to say. Well, let's hope your sister does.
Jake saw Dan pulled under.
Jake is only alive because Elly saved him.
that means you either saw what happened or were involved with what happened.
you need to tell us, Anna.
because I know naiads can only be out of the water for so long.
and you will die in here if you don't start talking.
who pulled Jake under the water?
who killed Dan?
knowing what they are and what will happen to them, we don't want to keep them locked up.
but they're not giving us much choice.
at the very least, they know what happened and didn't report it. So they might know who did it.
that's the problem, we think they're protecting somebody.
how much time do you think they have? I doubt they'll survive the night.
and what about the girl who saved your victim from the river? Can't find her.
so how do we explain two dead women in our holding cells? We can't very well say they're naiads.
we'll get blamed for something we had no control over. And they're playing a very serious game.
if they're involved, what do we do, just let 'em go?
no. This is their problem, not ours.
if they choose to die, we let the M. E. explain it.
just 'cause they're wesen, it doesn't entitle them to special treatment.
yeah?
girls' father, Abel Mahario, is here.
apparently, he wants to talk.
I killed that boy. I did it.
you need to arrest me and let my daughters go.
how'd you kill him? - I drowned him.
Why? I have my reasons.
I know you didn't do it for a cell phone.
we know you want to save your girls, but we'd rather leave here with whoever's really responsible.
I am! I told you I did it!
I-I pulled him underwater!
were your daughters there too? - No.
Jake Barnes says they were. - Well, he's lying.
why would he lie?
he just saw them.
then they were there?
I saw those two boys attacking my daughters, and I did what I had to.
so you're telling us you were saving your daughters?
they were being raped.
then why did your other daughter pull Jake out of the water?
who gave you the black eye? Did you know she was there too?
what time did you get there?
how did you get there? - You walk? Take a car?
what did the other guy look like, the one you killed?
was he tall, short, fat, black, white?
we need some details here. Why don't you take us to the place where it happened?
you see how difficult this gets when you're not telling the truth?
why does it matter?
I'm offering my life for my daughters'.
not easy being a parent. Yeah, but it could be what we need.
those girls may be ready to throw their own lives away, but they might not be so willing when it's their dad's life they're dealing with.
use his confession as leverage? Might be just as tough being a daughter.
I guess we'll find out if it's a loving family.
you're the one who saved my life.
what's your name?
okay.
what are you doing here, Elly?
Oh, you're deaf?
but you can read my lips?
okay.
you know, I almost thought I imagined you.
um, the police need to talk to you.
the police, they're looking for you.
what are you doing? You want to show me something?
something about you? Okay.
what are you doing?
you want to go swimming?
huh? Now?
Oh, my God.
you... you're what I saw.
my God, you're real?
No!
No! No!
no
Hey! What's going on down there?
Mm! - We gotta go.
the last in a long line of boxes.
what have we here?
Oh, I'm not sure. That was in my brother's apartment.
this is really...
it-it's interesting. Oh, wow!
I have not seen that since I was a kid.
belonged to my grandparents. They brought it with them from Holland.
well, in that case, it should sit in a place of honor.
Hey. Don't try so hard.
I know this is a big deal for you and me, moving in together, but we have to be honest.
that is butt ugly.
I know, but... - But what?
I mean, maybe there's things of mine that you don't like.
what are you afraid of?
me.
Why?
there have been other... you know, but no one I ever even considered moving in with.
are you getting cold feet?
no. God, no. I knew it would sound like that.
stop.
it's okay. It's all going to be okay.
I just didn't want you to think...
stop thinking. - Mm.
I love you, you love me, and we both hate this.
and if you can't build a relationship on hate...
right, then... I mean, what do you have?
us.
your father confessed to everything.
you are free to go. What?
what did... what did he confess to?
the murder of Dan Hopkins and the attempted murder of Jake Barnes.
that's a lie. - You think we'd be letting you go if we didn't have a confession?
no. This isn't right.
Sarah, they're letting us go.
and arresting dad? He'll die here.
we can talk about this at home. It's dad, Anna.
Sarah, don't.
Dominic did it.
Dominic? - And Jesse too.
it's those two guys from the marina.
they'll kill us, Sarah.
you don't have much time left. We need to get you out of here.
Sarah, he's a Grimm. You can't trust him.
I have no choice.
let's go.
Anna, come on.
we didn't even know they were there. Dominic and Jesse?
they must have been waiting for us in the river.
Dominic pulled Dan under, and Jesse pulled Jake.
Why? It was time to start our families.
you start your families by killing two innocent victims? That wasn't supposed to happen.
in the old days, maybe, but we don't do that anymore.
at least we didn't...
till Dominic and Jesse showed up about six months ago.
from where? - Alaska.
did you know them prior to that?
no. Our relationships are arranged.
Dominic and Jesse come from a family that believe in all of these...
old traditions.
we didn't think that they would actually do anything, we just... we just thought they were talking.
this is some kind of ritual?
I think that's what they want us to think, but it's more about revenge.
we can only conceive and give birth in the water.
naiad men are born sterile.
they know we have to mate with other men. Otherwise, we'll die out.
I mean, they're not very happy about it, but neither are we.
well, I can see where that may cause a little bit of tension.
our men have to raise the children of other men.
I mean, some of them are okay with it, but...
others aren't so... Accepting.
it's Jake. Hello?
detective Burkhardt? It's Jake.
she was just here, the girl who saved me.
where are you? - At my apartment. She was in the pool.
those two guys from the marina, they jumped me and took her.
stay where you are. We're gonna send some uniforms your way.
Jesse and Dominic beat up Jake. Elly was there, and they took her.
Oh, my God, they're gonna cut her.
what? - They'll cut the telae between her fingers and toes.
it's how they used to banish those that broke our laws. Where would they take her?
where they can make an example
home.
you left us no other choice. I know you can understand me.
this is for the good of all of us.
shouldn't have done that! Now you're gonna get it!
tie her legs.
you like their kind so much? Now you can be just like them.
ow, damn it! She won't stop kicking. I'll make her stop kicking.
come on, Elly, you gotta breathe sometime.
breathe.
stubborn little bitch. Not for much longer. Breathe or drown, Elly!
she's breathing.
that's a good girl, Elly. - Cut her quick!
damn it! We're gonna have to hold her under again.
push her in. - Oh.
police!
no, no, you don't!
you're staying right here.
here.
you all right?
I think so.
are you okay?
I got Dominic and Jesse handcuffed. How do you want to deal with them?
lock 'em up. They won't last long.
they should've thought about that before. You know how long you were under that water?
thought you were dead. You sure look like it.
Oh, my God! Elly? - Elly!
Oh, thank God she's okay. - Oh, baby, come here.
you're okay.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my girls.
I can't find anything medically wrong with you, "except you appear to have a metabolic rate "half a normal person's.
I can't explain this, but it doesn't seem "to be interfering with your life.
you seem healthy, with tremendous physical endurance.

royal assassination causing much turmoil.
no longer safe. Must leave now.
love you, M.
love you, M"?
who the hell is M, Nick?
europe and the world have gathered today in Vienna, Austria, to mourn the passing of crown prince Eric Renard, second in line to the Cronenberg throne and empire.
british media report allegations by an unnamed source that an underground movement may have been responsible for the crown prince's assassination.
austrian police are working with French and British intelligence to find those responsible.
the question on everyone's mind is who will be given the reins of this royal family?
number three.
you sure? - Yeah.
look, can I... can I ask you guys something?
sure.
I-I'm not so sure how to say this, but...
you know that girl that pulled me out of the water, Elly? What about her?
well, I don't know, but
I saw something really strange.
like what? - Like, I...
think she's, like, a mutant or something, some kind of, like, mermaid thing... I...
okay, I know how that sounds, believe me.
I just... She came over when and she just wasn't...
normal.
nobody is, Jake.
it's Portland.
sleep CHILD, SLEEP NOW... OR ELSE THE BOGEYMAN WILL COME AND EAT YOU.

no, please. I won't talk. I won't talk.
no, you won't.
come on.
hell yeah. Let's go, let's go.

love YOU, M
long day, huh? -Yeah. You?
I read your medical reports.
is there something bad? -No. Your metabolism is pretty extraordinary.
that's why I'm sensing something's wrong here?
you know what, it is none of my business. -Well, I think that means it is.
I shouldn't have been on your email.
I told you to go in my email.
I have nothing to hide.
anymore.
you sure?
what's going on? Haven't been able to spend the money.
royal assassination causing much turmoil.
no longer safe. Must leave now.
love you. M.
when did this come in? -A couple of hours ago.
you want to tell me who "M" is and why she loves you?
I'm assuming it's a she.
Yeah.
well?
"m" is my mother.
Really? Your mother?
the one who died in the accident with your father... -she's not dead.
your mother's not dead? -No, and I think she's in some kind of trouble.
hold on, Nick. One thing at a time. I'm still working on your mother being alive. HOW...
when did you find this out? -Last year.
when you were in the coma, she showed up.
where? -Here.
in the house? -Yes.
and in your hospital room. -She came to my hospital room?
look, Juliette, there was a lot going on that night.
do you remember, when you asked about the broken window, I said a bird flew into it?
well, that's not exactly what happened.
a guy broke into the house, and he was waiting here for me. Look.
there's another mark up here from where I took a shot at him.
with your gun? -Crossbow, actually, but that's beside the point.
I could have died if it hadn't been for my mother.
at first, I didn't know who it was.
then she called me Nicky.
and I recognized her voice, and I knew it was her.
So-so... Wow, so...
so she didn't die in the accident, but a friend of hers was with my dad that night.
and the people who killed my parents thought it was her, and she thought she was protecting me by staying out of my life.
you found out all this in one night? -Yeah.
and you were in the coma. Not one of my better nights.
why didn't you tell me till now?
well, we weren't exactly together until now.
and...
because she's like me.
or I'm like her. However you want to look at it.
she's a Grimm?
it's genetic? -Yes.
and I didn't find that out until she showed up.
imagine my surprise.
why didn't she stay?
she had to go because of some things that she did here.
and that message means that she's in trouble.
and there's nothing I can do to help her. -I'm sorry.
is there anything that I can do?
no, you're doing it.
I'm just glad that I don't have to lie to you anymore. -Me too.
I wish I could have met her.
did she like me? -For someone who was in a coma, yeah.

good TO HAVE A CHANGE OF PACE - No bag. - No bag.
have a nice day. -Gracias.
Thanks.
let's do it. - Vamos.
everybody down.
get on the ground.
get down!
okay.
come on! V!
VAMANOS.
let's go, let's go, let's go.
come on.
No! No! No! No!
No!
Oh, God! Oh, no, please. Oh, God.
hey fellas.
well, it could have been a good night, but we got two dead bodies.
one here, one down by a parked car.
killer went for the throat.
it was pretty bloody.
no wallet.
neighbor who heard the screams called it in. -Where's the neighbor?
he's in the back of my car. Name's Martinez.
he's pretty shook up. I thought he was gonna get sick.
and to tell you the truth, I don't blame him. -Anybody else hear this?
he's the only one willing to talk.
all right, let's get some prints.
Mr. Martinez? We're Detectives Burkhardt and Griffin.
we understand you witnessed the attack. -No, I only heard it.
can you describe what you heard? -It was horrible, like they were being torn apart by dogs.
how long after you heard it did you come outside? -Couple of minutes.
I just put on some sweats, came out, and saw what happened.
you see anybody running from the area? -No.
you worried about something?
actually, I don't know what I heard.
can I go? I really didn't see anything. I just called 911.
we may need to contact you later, but, yes, you're free to go.
he's scared.
Yeah, well, he just saw a guy with his throat ripped out.
bound to give you some indigestion.
let's go check out the car.
got two wallets.
Eddie Otero. Guessin' that's Eddie.
Alfredo Guzman. Sort of looks like what's left of the other guy.
why put your wallet in the glove box?
I got something back here.
two masks.
two 9 millimeters.
a bag...
full of money.
I'm going out on a limb here and say these boys were up to no good.
so what took them down? - And left the money?
well, maybe the killer didn't know about the money.
or got run off before he could come back for it.
wesen?
wesen like money just as much as anyone else.
feral dogs? -Well, here's something interesting.
call just came through. Convenience store around the corner was hit.
look, more cops. You see what's going on here, right?
I mean, you see it?
criminals are taking over the neighborhood and what the hell are you doing about it?
nothing.
who's this guy? - David Florez. Local hothead.
whenever we show up, he shows up to tell us how badly we're screwing up.
so crime's our fault? - Seems to be.
typical stop and rob.
two guys came in waving guns, emptied the register.
they wore masks so we're not getting much in the way of a description.
I think we already got them. -Wait, what? How?
we got two bodies around the corner.
guns, masks, and a bag of money.
somebody killed 'em?
and left the money behind? -If they're our guys.
who did it? - Don't know.
it's what we call "a mystery." -Oh, that's what that is.
security cams up? -System's in back.
back it up a few minutes before. Somebody might have seen 'em on the street before they came in.
this guy left 2 and 1/2 minutes before the robbery.
that'd put him in the witness ballpark. Let's see who's next.
she might have seen them. -Anybody else?
if this guy left just before they came in he might have seen them go in, come out...
or what happened to them. -See if we can I. D. these three.
bring 'em in. - Yeah. Will do.
track IP ADDRESS
location: VISNJA GORA
where the hell is Visnja Gora?
I didn't see anybody after I left the store.
no dogs either. I drove right home.
I heard what happened as soon as I got back to my apartment.
it's terrible. I was hoping this neighborhood would be safer.
I'm afraid I didn't see anything. At least not that I can remember.
I wish I could be more helpful. As soon as I left the store I got on a bus and headed home.
what bus did you take? - The 72.
how far was the bus stop from the store? -It's just down the street.
and did you see anything?
I'm sorry. No.
I had to run for the bus. -So you live in the neighborhood and you took the bus.
Yeah. It's only one stop, but I had groceries.
did you see any loose dogs on the street?
no.
there are a lot of kids in the neighborhood and we've got two dead men.
if there are any dangerous animals running around, you should help us do something about it.
there's this one guy, Ray Bolton.
he has dogs. I heard he fights 'em on weekends.
I know they get out sometimes. But, look, this guy is...
you can't be saying I told you. -We won't.
I thought you'd be asleep. -I can't sleep.
not with all that's going on. -What's going on?
look what I found.
Visnja Gora. It's in Slovenia.
right in the middle. -And we care about that because?
because that is where your mom's email was sent from.
I mean, she said she was in danger, so I thought I'd better look into where it came from, so I tracked the IP address of the server it was sent from.
I wish I could track down the actual address she sent it from, but for that I would need access to the ISP, which, you know, I obviously don't have.
so she's in Slovenia?
or was when she sent the email. What kind of trouble is she in?
she's a Grimm. A lot of people want her dead.
she's on her way to Greece, and she's out there all alone.
what you got there? -Ray Bolton.
the guy with the dogs? - Yeah.
professional bad guy.
convictions for assault, narcotics distribution, and illegal firearms.
that's a nice way to start the morning. -Oh, it gets better.
our two dead guys, Guzman and Otero, are known associates of Bolton.
are we thinking he killed them? -Got motive.
Guzman testified against him on a narcotics charge last year.
could have turned his dogs on them and got Otero too.
guess we'd better check 'em out.
let's get animal control to meet us out there in case Bolton's dogs killed those guys.
who are you? - Ray Bolton.
we're investigating a possible murder. We need to check out your dogs.
my dogs didn't do nothing.
the two victims were old pals of yours, Eddie Otero and Alfredo guzman.
we have reason to believe they were killed by dogs. -And they need to be swabbed.
Hey, you ain't takin' my dogs.
Yes, we are. And if they weren't involved you get 'em back.
I said you ain't takin' my dogs. Get your hands off of me!
Grimm. You're not takin' my dogs!
we're taking your dogs and we're taking you.
hell yeah. Hell yeah! It's about time you got this trash off the street.
him again? - Called you 100 times about this dude.
stay back, sir. -That's right, lock his ass up.
you keep talking, bro. Keep talkin'.
now what?
Rosalee, can you get that? - Got it.
Thanks.
I'll probably be home a little late tonight. I'm expecting a delivery.
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, I think I have the wrong number. -Are you looking for Monroe?
Oh, yes. -May I say who's calling?
his mother.
it's your mother. Does she know that we're...
no.
not yet.
let me talk to her.
Hey, mom. How are you?
I don't suppose that was the cleaning lady who answered the phone.
no, mom, that was Rosalee. She's my girlfriend.
Oh, you've got a girlfriend. When did that happen?
a while ago. -Well, you sound kind of busy.
call us back when you have a chance. -Yeah.
that's a good idea.
okay, love you. -We love you too.
I guess we should probably tell our parents what we're doing.
now that we're doing it, yeah.
I mean, we're grown people. -We're adults.
so when do you think we should...
later. - Right.
okay.
Bye. -Bye.
he knows what you are.
what's he? - I'm not sure.
looked sort of like a Hundjager mixed up with a Daemonfeuer.
I have no idea what you're talking about, but he could be our guy.
he didn't seem too bothered about me being a Grimm. -Wait till he gets to know you better.
you got no right to do this to me. -What? Didn't he attack an officer of the law?
I remember something like that. -Anything happens to my dog...
shut up.
only thing we wanna hear from you is why you killed guzman and Otero.
I had nothing to do with that. - No?
Guzman testifies against you, you got no problem with that? -That case got thrown out.
and you don't hold grudges. You're such a forgiving guy.
people always get what's coming to 'em.
you sick your dogs on him, or did you rip 'em up yourself?
Yeah, that's right.
my dogs could have done it or I could have done it, but we didn't.
I was at home with my lady, nowhere near those fools.
swab my dogs all you want, 'cause you got nothing. I'm gonna Sue your dumb asses.
we got motive. -Yeah, but no evidence to tie him to it.
if the girlfriend corroborates... and she will... we won't get a warrant.
got your report from animal control. Don't think you're gonna like it.
hair and saliva from Bolton's dogs don't match what they found on the bodies.
they'd like to take the dogs back, but you got the owner locked up.
what do you want me to tell 'em?
tell them the owner assaulted a police officer and we're going to keep him for a while.
they should do the same with the dogs. -Copy that.
okay, If Bolton is what I saw, then he's more than capable of killing those guys the way that they were killed.
then he wouldn't have needed his dogs, but the dogs were good cover.
we look at the dogs and not him. We should be swabbing him.
even if that comes up positive, how do we explain how he did what he did?
let's swab the son of a bitch anyway. I want him to know that we know.
I wanna know what we're dealing with.
no dog did this. -How can you tell?
usually when a dog or coyote or wolf bites down in attack it'll shake the victim and you'd see more tearing in the wounds.
who wants more caprese? - Me.
definitely not a Blutbad. Fyi, too much general mangling.
we're more of a throat first and ask questions later.
plus...
Yeah, there's no signs of going after the legs first to cripple the prey.
sorry. Victim.
which is what a canine would do, so, yeah, you're probably dealing with a wesen and powerful.
you don't know what kind of wesen you're dealing with?
a sort of part Hundjager, part Daemonfeuer.
that sounds like a... - Hollentier.
exactly what I was thinking.
Bigish eyes, snoutyish, brutish, neanderthalesque.
basically a jerkwad. - That's him.
because a hollentier could definitely do that.
what does "hollentier" mean? Is it German?
basically, it means "beast from hell.
they actually have a really ancient lineage all the way back to the Egyptians.
how did he react to you?
he didn't seem to care all that much.
definitely a hollentier then.
this wesen wasn't afraid of you? -He didn't appear to be.
your basic hollentier is too stupid to know what to be afraid of.
which is why the Egyptians used to entomb them with their pharaohs.
they thought it was a promotion until, you know, they buried 'em alive.
can somebody pass the, um, what do you call it?
the artichokes or the Edamame Tabouleh?
both?
so where is this hollentier now?
uh, we've got him locked up.
you put a pharaoh in there with him he'll stay forever.
just sayin'.
stop!
stop! Quit fighting!
so the guy drags the woman here to assault her, then gets annihilated.
and Bolton's locked up. It wasn't him. We have to let him go.
can't say I'm happy about that.
now we got three vics in the same neighborhood.
all bad guys. Seems like we got a vigilante on our hands.
vigilante wesen.
would the witness have seen him? -Possibly.
but even if she did, she wouldn't know what she saw.
don't I know it. EMTs are through treating Miss Ramos.
she's pretty shook up. She's got more to say.
Florez is back.
not again.
is he doggin' us or does he get here before we do?
we should run him and make sure. -Yeah.
I'm Detective Burkhardt and this is Detective Griffin.
you Miss Ramos? - Yes.
do you feel up to answering a few questions?
I can.
did you know the man who attacked you?
no.
had you ever seen him before? -No.
can you tell us what you saw after you got off the bus?
I walked down the street.
I heard someone following me and I turned to look, but he turned away and went down another street.
I thought I was being paranoid.
that's when he attacked me.
I tried to scream, but he hit me...
and knocked me down and was going to...
I don't know what happened next.
I'm sorry.
it was horrible.
horrible.
can you describe who killed the man that attacked you?
just try to tell us what you saw.
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.
is that a name?
do you know this El Cucuy?
we all do.
we know what El Cucuy is? -Not a clue.
she said everybody knows it. -Everybody except us.
gotta be Spanish, right? -Sounds like.
Juliette? -Think so.
now you see that?
somebody doing your job. -Hey.
cleaning up the streets. - Hey! Hey, that's enough. Move on.
time to go home. -Mr. Florez is starting to get on my nerves.
el Cucuy. Ever heard of it?
Yeah, actually. It's like the boogeyman.
a bunch of different names for it in Spanish.
my grandma used to call it "El Coco," and whenever I was bad, like I wouldn't go to bed, she would say it was gonna come and get me or if I didn't make the bed, it would be hiding under the bed waiting for me, or if I didn't eat my vegetables.
you get the picture. -You mean it's not real?
well, when you're a little kid, everything's real.
why, who told you about El Cucuy?
the victim.
she said El Cucuy killed the man that attacked her.
she said it was El Cucuy?
so, what, are you thinking it's wesen?
we don't know what we're thinking.
there's actually somebody who might know.
it's SO GOOD TO SEE YOU, MY DEAR. PLEASE COME IN
I'm GLAD THINGS HAV WORKED OUT FOR YOU
thank YOU, PLIAR. ME TOO
this IS NICK, HE'S
I know who he is.
you are interested in El Cucuy.
Yeah, a woman was attacked by a man that was killed.
and she says it was El Cucuy that saved her life.
I COULD SENSE IT ...
you COULD SENSE WHAT?
I could sense it was coming.
please sit.
when I was a child in Guadalajara, there was a time of great sorrow.
no one was safe.
the people of my neighborhood were being terrorized.
I was so scared I would sleep under the bed of my parents.
then one night,
I heard the woman next door calling,
her husband had been killed that day.
and I heard another woman calling, come and save us from this evil.
one house to the other, night after night, calling for help...
and just when I thought it would never get better, one of the evil men was dead on our street.
and then another was dead on another street.
and then a third, torn up like they had been attacked by wild dogs, until no evil men were left in our barrio.
have you ever seen El Cucuy? -No.
but one of the women on my street did.
we asked her what El Cucuy looked like.
she said its eyes glowed yellow, its teeth were sharp like razors, and its breath was foul like something who had eaten the dead.
and it could hear the cries of those in sorrow.
so you believe.
I believe El Cucuy wanders from place to place.
and it waits until it is called by voices of women who have suffered from evil.
if enough voices cry out, they become one voice that cannot be ignored.
then it wakes and hunts.
if El Cucuy is here, it is to answer that call.
I got nothing.
you find anything? -Lots.
this one is about a Grimm who tracked down and beheaded an entire family of Faeteo Fatalis in...
whoa, in 1655, who were wreaking havoc in Vlatos on the island of Crete.
but no. I haven't found anything that looks or sounds like El Cucuy.
it's a big world, maybe this is just one they haven't encountered yet.
or maybe it's in a book that was never handed down to my relatives.
who knows how much is still out there?
maybe it isn't even wesen.
well, look at you, just walking the streets like you own them.
this is not your neighborhood. It's mine.
disrespect me again, and they'll never find you...
or your mother.
you see something?
take care of this, Paul.
you got a positive on our attacker from last night... Stephen Stillman.
last known address, Vancouver, Washington.
any link between him, Otero, guzman, or Bolton? -None.
what about this Florez who keeps showing up at the crime scenes? - Florez lives with his mother.
a couple domestic disturbance calls.
he's a marine, did three tours in Afghanistan, diagnosed with PTSD.
this marine comes back from the war, suffering from PTSD, finds crime on the rise in his neighborhood, decides to do something about it.
kind of makes sense. We think he's our guy?
it could be. We're still working it.
surveillance footage from the bus last night just came in... any takers?
Yeah. Put it up.
this is from the 75 bus last night.
that's the victim, Ms. Ramos.
that's Stillman, the guy that attacked her.
and the guy in front of him is the one she thought was following her.
but he turned down another street.
well, he might have seen something, but he didn't come forward.
and we might want to think about talking to... -Hey.
don't we know her? -Yeah, she was at the convenience store robbery.
we brought her in for questioning. -Mrs. Garcia, right?
same woman at two crime scenes? -In the same area apparently.
I think you need to talk to her again.
David, what's wrong? -They let him out!
who? -The police! They let him out!
what are you talking about? Open the door.
mijo, open this door!
if the police are too scared to take care of him... -Mijo, open this door!
then I will.
David! Open this door! David, open this door!
who is it? -It's the police, Mrs. Garcia.
detectives Burkhardt and Griffin. We spoke with you the other night?
Oh, yes. I remember.
I-I'm always a little nervous about opening my door after dark.
would you like to come in? I can make you some tea.
actually, we'd like you to come down to the precinct with us.
have I done something wrong? -No, ma'am.
you were on the 75 bus last night. -Yes, I was.
how did you know? -There are surveillance cameras on the buses.
can... can I ask you what this is about?
we'd rather ask you a few questions at the precinct. There's some photos we'd like you to look at.
Oh, yes. Well, of course, if you need me to.
I'll just get my coat.
I gotta tell you, Nick, I don't think she's gonna be much help.
I hope you don't mind, but I don't get many handsome young men visitors anymore.
Oh. This is a nice car.
I bet it's fast. -When it has to be.
Burkhardt. Call just came in from David Florez's mother.
she's really upset. Said he came home furious that we let Bolton go.
I'm assuming that means he's going to Bolton's house to confront him.
how do you want to handle this?
meet us there. We can try to intercept him.
we got a problem with Florez. Apparently he's pretty upset that we let Bolton go.
mom called it in, thinks he might be going after Bolton. - Then we better go.
sorry, Mrs. Garcia. But we're gonna have to make a detour.
Oh, no problem. Whatever you need to do.
it sounds very exciting.
open the door!
I have come to disrespect you and everything you stand for.
you are going to leave this place or I'm gonna make you leave!
this is not your neighborhood!
you do not belong here! -This fool's gonna bring the police.
get this stuff outta here. I'll take care of him.
open the door!
what, you didn't get enough the first time?
stop! Police!
Hey, he came on my property with that knife. This is self-defense.
get back in your house. Arrest him.
I'm pressing charges, man. He tried to kill me!
get in the house or we'll arrest you.
let's call an ambulance. Let's get him into the car.
you shouldn't have let him go, man.
shouldn't have let him go. -Where is she?
she's not here. - Where'd she go?
dumbass cops, got nothin' on me. I told you guys to get out of here.
stay with him!
back away.
ay, Chihuahua. You're a Grimm.
I had no idea.
you're 77 years old. -Last month.
you killed guzman and Otero.
and Stillman, who attacked Ms. Ramos under the bridge.
I know it looks bad, but do you really think anyone is going to believe that I could do such things?
you're El Cucuy. -I've been called many things.
you have Bolton's blood all over you. -Well, yes, you brought me to Mr. Bolton's house.
and I heard the terrible screaming, I went in to help.
Oh, I must have gotten all bloody when I tried to save him.
"save him"? Really?
Oh, you don't need to worry about me anymore. I have done what I came to do.
the neighborhood is safe again. And I-I really should be moving on.
you really think we can just let you go?
well, I don't think you have any choice.
are you kidding me?
they are evil.
find THEM... FIND THEM...
you must help us. El Cucuy...
sleep CHILD, SLEEP NOW... OR ELSE THE BOGEYMAN WILL COME AND EAT YOU.
two WEEKS AGO...
Ah, crap.
get over here. Open the register.
no, please. I won't talk. I won't talk.
no, you won't.
come on.
hell yeah. Let's go, let's go.
shocking footage of a brazen robbery at a gas station in the Jefferson district.
police report it happened around 9:30 this evening.
the cashier on duty has been identified as 18-year-old Andres Venegas who's in critical condition at an area hospital tonight.
this horrific incident... Andres.
Andres, Mijo.
they WON'T GET AWAY EITH THIS.
someone IS GONNA MAKE THEM PAY FOR THIS...
someone MUST FIND THESE TERRIBLE PEOPLE WHO DID THIS TO MY SON...
someone MUST PUNISH THEM...
please...
... DON'T LET MY GOOD BOY DIE
he's NEVER DONE ANYTHING BAD IN HIS WHOLE LIFE...
the MEN WHO HAVE DONE THIS ARE EVIL...
another violent robbery...
please HEAR ME, LISTEN TO MY TEARS...
listen TO MY CRIES FOR JUSTICE
listen TO THE GRIEF IN MY HEART.
do NOT ALLOW THIS EVIL TO WALK THE STREETS
for THEY WILL BRING MORE TEARS TO MORE MOTHERS...
and there were no eyewitnesses. The suspects have yet to be identified.
they remain at large. Police consider them armed and dangerous.
they warn you not to approach them. If you have any information...
haven't BEEN ABLE TO SPEND THE MONEY
royal ASSASSINATION CAUSING MUCH TURMOIL
no LONGER SAFE
must LEAVE NOW
love YOU, M
long day, huh? -Yeah. You?
I read your medical reports.
is there something bad? -No. Your metabolism is pretty extraordinary.
that's why I'm sensing something's wrong here?
you know what, it is none of my business. -Well, I think that means it is.
I shouldn't have been on your email.
I told you to go in my email.
I have nothing to hide.
anymore.
you sure?
what's going on? Haven't been able to spend the money.
royal assassination causing much turmoil.
no longer safe. Must leave now.
love you. M.
when did this come in? -A couple of hours ago.
you want to tell me who "M" is and why she loves you?
I'm assuming it's a she.
Yeah.
well?
"m" is my mother.
Really? Your mother?
the one who died in the accident with your father... -she's not dead.
your mother's not dead? -No, and I think she's in some kind of trouble.
hold on, Nick. One thing at a time. I'm still working on your mother being alive. HOW...
when did you find this out? -Last year.
when you were in the coma, she showed up.
where? -Here.
in the house? -Yes.
and in your hospital room. -She came to my hospital room?
look, Juliette, there was a lot going on that night.
do you remember, when you asked about the broken window, I said a bird flew into it?
well, that's not exactly what happened.
a guy broke into the house, and he was waiting here for me. Look.
there's another mark up here from where I took a shot at him.
with your gun? -Crossbow, actually, but that's beside the point.
I could have died if it hadn't been for my mother.
at first, I didn't know who it was.
then she called me Nicky.
and I recognized her voice, and I knew it was her.
So-so... Wow, so...
so she didn't die in the accident, but a friend of hers was with my dad that night.
and the people who killed my parents thought it was her, and she thought she was protecting me by staying out of my life.
you found out all this in one night? -Yeah.
and you were in the coma. Not one of my better nights.
why didn't you tell me till now?
well, we weren't exactly together until now.
and...
because she's like me.
or I'm like her. However you want to look at it.
she's a Grimm?
it's genetic? -Yes.
and I didn't find that out until she showed up.
imagine my surprise.
why didn't she stay?
she had to go because of some things that she did here.
and that message means that she's in trouble.
and there's nothing I can do to help her. -I'm sorry.
is there anything that I can do?
no, you're doing it.
I'm just glad that I don't have to lie to you anymore. -Me too.
I wish I could have met her.
did she like me? -For someone who was in a coma, yeah.

have a nice day. -Gracias.
Thanks.
let's do it. - Vamos.
everybody down.
get on the ground.
get down!
okay.
come on! V!
VAMANOS.
let's go, let's go, let's go.
come on.
No! No! No! No!
No!
Oh, God! Oh, no, please. Oh, God.
hey fellas.
well, it could have been a good night, but we got two dead bodies.
one here, one down by a parked car.
killer went for the throat.
it was pretty bloody.
no wallet.
neighbor who heard the screams called it in. -Where's the neighbor?
he's in the back of my car. Name's Martinez.
he's pretty shook up. I thought he was gonna get sick.
and to tell you the truth, I don't blame him. -Anybody else hear this?
he's the only one willing to talk.
all right, let's get some prints.
Mr. Martinez? We're Detectives Burkhardt and Griffin.
we understand you witnessed the attack. -No, I only heard it.
can you describe what you heard? -It was horrible, like they were being torn apart by dogs.
how long after you heard it did you come outside? -Couple of minutes.
I just put on some sweats, came out, and saw what happened.
you see anybody running from the area? -No.
you worried about something?
actually, I don't know what I heard.
can I go? I really didn't see anything. I just called 911.
we may need to contact you later, but, yes, you're free to go.
he's scared.
Yeah, well, he just saw a guy with his throat ripped out.
bound to give you some indigestion.
let's go check out the car.
got two wallets.
Eddie Otero. Guessin' that's Eddie.
Alfredo Guzman. Sort of looks like what's left of the other guy.
why put your wallet in the glove box?
I got something back here.
two masks.
two 9 millimeters.
a bag...
full of money.
I'm going out on a limb here and say these boys were up to no good.
so what took them down? - And left the money?
well, maybe the killer didn't know about the money.
or got run off before he could come back for it.
wesen?
wesen like money just as much as anyone else.
feral dogs? -Well, here's something interesting.
call just came through. Convenience store around the corner was hit.
look, more cops. You see what's going on here, right?
I mean, you see it?
criminals are taking over the neighborhood and what the hell are you doing about it?
nothing.
who's this guy? - David Florez. Local hothead.
whenever we show up, he shows up to tell us how badly we're screwing up.
so crime's our fault? - Seems to be.
typical stop and rob.
two guys came in waving guns, emptied the register.
they wore masks so we're not getting much in the way of a description.
I think we already got them. -Wait, what? How?
we got two bodies around the corner.
guns, masks, and a bag of money.
somebody killed 'em?
and left the money behind? -If they're our guys.
who did it? - Don't know.
it's what we call "a mystery." -Oh, that's what that is.
security cams up? -System's in back.
back it up a few minutes before. Somebody might have seen 'em on the street before they came in.
this guy left 2 and 1/2 minutes before the robbery.
that'd put him in the witness ballpark. Let's see who's next.
she might have seen them. -Anybody else?
if this guy left just before they came in he might have seen them go in, come out...
or what happened to them. -See if we can I. D. these three.
bring 'em in. - Yeah. Will do.
track IP ADDRESS
location: VISNJA GORA
where the hell is Visnja Gora?
I didn't see anybody after I left the store.
no dogs either. I drove right home.
I heard what happened as soon as I got back to my apartment.
it's terrible. I was hoping this neighborhood would be safer.
I'm afraid I didn't see anything. At least not that I can remember.
I wish I could be more helpful. As soon as I left the store I got on a bus and headed home.
what bus did you take? - The 72.
how far was the bus stop from the store? -It's just down the street.
and did you see anything?
I'm sorry. No.
I had to run for the bus. -So you live in the neighborhood and you took the bus.
Yeah. It's only one stop, but I had groceries.
did you see any loose dogs on the street?
no.
there are a lot of kids in the neighborhood and we've got two dead men.
if there are any dangerous animals running around, you should help us do something about it.
there's this one guy, Ray Bolton.
he has dogs. I heard he fights 'em on weekends.
I know they get out sometimes. But, look, this guy is...
you can't be saying I told you. -We won't.
I thought you'd be asleep. -I can't sleep.
not with all that's going on. -What's going on?
look what I found.
Visnja Gora. It's in Slovenia.
right in the middle. -And we care about that because?
because that is where your mom's email was sent from.
I mean, she said she was in danger, so I thought I'd better look into where it came from, so I tracked the IP address of the server it was sent from.
I wish I could track down the actual address she sent it from, but for that I would need access to the ISP, which, you know, I obviously don't have.
so she's in Slovenia?
or was when she sent the email. What kind of trouble is she in?
she's a Grimm. A lot of people want her dead.
she's on her way to Greece, and she's out there all alone.
what you got there? -Ray Bolton.
the guy with the dogs? - Yeah.
professional bad guy.
convictions for assault, narcotics distribution, and illegal firearms.
that's a nice way to start the morning. -Oh, it gets better.
our two dead guys, Guzman and Otero, are known associates of Bolton.
are we thinking he killed them? -Got motive.
Guzman testified against him on a narcotics charge last year.
could have turned his dogs on them and got Otero too.
guess we'd better check 'em out.
let's get animal control to meet us out there in case Bolton's dogs killed those guys.
who are you? - Ray Bolton.
we're investigating a possible murder. We need to check out your dogs.
my dogs didn't do nothing.
the two victims were old pals of yours, Eddie Otero and Alfredo guzman.
we have reason to believe they were killed by dogs. -And they need to be swabbed.
Hey, you ain't takin' my dogs.
Yes, we are. And if they weren't involved you get 'em back.
I said you ain't takin' my dogs. Get your hands off of me!
Grimm. You're not takin' my dogs!
we're taking your dogs and we're taking you.
hell yeah. Hell yeah! It's about time you got this trash off the street.
him again? - Called you 100 times about this dude.
stay back, sir. -That's right, lock his ass up.
you keep talking, bro. Keep talkin'.
now what?
Rosalee, can you get that? - Got it.
Thanks.
I'll probably be home a little late tonight. I'm expecting a delivery.
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, I think I have the wrong number. -Are you looking for Monroe?
Oh, yes. -May I say who's calling?
his mother.
it's your mother. Does she know that we're...
no.
not yet.
let me talk to her.
Hey, mom. How are you?
I don't suppose that was the cleaning lady who answered the phone.
no, mom, that was Rosalee. She's my girlfriend.
Oh, you've got a girlfriend. When did that happen?
a while ago. -Well, you sound kind of busy.
call us back when you have a chance. -Yeah.
that's a good idea.
okay, love you. -We love you too.
I guess we should probably tell our parents what we're doing.
now that we're doing it, yeah.
I mean, we're grown people. -We're adults.
so when do you think we should...
later. - Right.
okay.
Bye. -Bye.
he knows what you are.
what's he? - I'm not sure.
looked sort of like a Hundjager mixed up with a Daemonfeuer.
I have no idea what you're talking about, but he could be our guy.
he didn't seem too bothered about me being a Grimm. -Wait till he gets to know you better.
you got no right to do this to me. -What? Didn't he attack an officer of the law?
I remember something like that. -Anything happens to my dog...
shut up.
only thing we wanna hear from you is why you killed guzman and Otero.
I had nothing to do with that. - No?
Guzman testifies against you, you got no problem with that? -That case got thrown out.
and you don't hold grudges. You're such a forgiving guy.
people always get what's coming to 'em.
you sick your dogs on him, or did you rip 'em up yourself?
Yeah, that's right.
my dogs could have done it or I could have done it, but we didn't.
I was at home with my lady, nowhere near those fools.
swab my dogs all you want, 'cause you got nothing. I'm gonna Sue your dumb asses.
we got motive. -Yeah, but no evidence to tie him to it.
if the girlfriend corroborates... and she will... we won't get a warrant.
got your report from animal control. Don't think you're gonna like it.
hair and saliva from Bolton's dogs don't match what they found on the bodies.
they'd like to take the dogs back, but you got the owner locked up.
what do you want me to tell 'em?
tell them the owner assaulted a police officer and we're going to keep him for a while.
they should do the same with the dogs. -Copy that.
okay, If Bolton is what I saw, then he's more than capable of killing those guys the way that they were killed.
then he wouldn't have needed his dogs, but the dogs were good cover.
we look at the dogs and not him. We should be swabbing him.
even if that comes up positive, how do we explain how he did what he did?
let's swab the son of a bitch anyway. I want him to know that we know.
I wanna know what we're dealing with.
no dog did this. -How can you tell?
usually when a dog or coyote or wolf bites down in attack it'll shake the victim and you'd see more tearing in the wounds.
who wants more caprese? - Me.
definitely not a Blutbad. Fyi, too much general mangling.
we're more of a throat first and ask questions later.
plus...
Yeah, there's no signs of going after the legs first to cripple the prey.
sorry. Victim.
which is what a canine would do, so, yeah, you're probably dealing with a wesen and powerful.
you don't know what kind of wesen you're dealing with?
a sort of part Hundjager, part Daemonfeuer.
that sounds like a... - Hollentier.
exactly what I was thinking.
Bigish eyes, snoutyish, brutish, neanderthalesque.
basically a jerkwad. - That's him.
because a hollentier could definitely do that.
what does "hollentier" mean? Is it German?
basically, it means "beast from hell.
they actually have a really ancient lineage all the way back to the Egyptians.
how did he react to you?
he didn't seem to care all that much.
definitely a hollentier then.
this wesen wasn't afraid of you? -He didn't appear to be.
your basic hollentier is too stupid to know what to be afraid of.
which is why the Egyptians used to entomb them with their pharaohs.
they thought it was a promotion until, you know, they buried 'em alive.
can somebody pass the, um, what do you call it?
the artichokes or the Edamame Tabouleh?
both?
so where is this hollentier now?
uh, we've got him locked up.
you put a pharaoh in there with him he'll stay forever.
just sayin'.
stop!
stop! Quit fighting!
so the guy drags the woman here to assault her, then gets annihilated.
and Bolton's locked up. It wasn't him. We have to let him go.
can't say I'm happy about that.
now we got three vics in the same neighborhood.
all bad guys. Seems like we got a vigilante on our hands.
vigilante wesen.
would the witness have seen him? -Possibly.
but even if she did, she wouldn't know what she saw.
don't I know it. EMTs are through treating Miss Ramos.
she's pretty shook up. She's got more to say.
Florez is back.
not again.
is he doggin' us or does he get here before we do?
we should run him and make sure. -Yeah.
I'm Detective Burkhardt and this is Detective Griffin.
you Miss Ramos? - Yes.
do you feel up to answering a few questions?
I can.
did you know the man who attacked you?
no.
had you ever seen him before? -No.
can you tell us what you saw after you got off the bus?
I walked down the street.
I heard someone following me and I turned to look, but he turned away and went down another street.
I thought I was being paranoid.
that's when he attacked me.
I tried to scream, but he hit me...
and knocked me down and was going to...
I don't know what happened next.
I'm sorry.
it was horrible.
horrible.
can you describe who killed the man that attacked you?
just try to tell us what you saw.
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.
is that a name?
do you know this El Cucuy?
we all do.
we know what El Cucuy is? -Not a clue.
she said everybody knows it. -Everybody except us.
gotta be Spanish, right? -Sounds like.
Juliette? -Think so.
now you see that?
somebody doing your job. -Hey.
cleaning up the streets. - Hey! Hey, that's enough. Move on.
time to go home. -Mr. Florez is starting to get on my nerves.
el Cucuy. Ever heard of it?
Yeah, actually. It's like the boogeyman.
a bunch of different names for it in Spanish.
my grandma used to call it "El Coco," and whenever I was bad, like I wouldn't go to bed, she would say it was gonna come and get me or if I didn't make the bed, it would be hiding under the bed waiting for me, or if I didn't eat my vegetables.
you get the picture. -You mean it's not real?
well, when you're a little kid, everything's real.
why, who told you about El Cucuy?
the victim.
she said El Cucuy killed the man that attacked her.
she said it was El Cucuy?
so, what, are you thinking it's wesen?
we don't know what we're thinking.
there's actually somebody who might know.
it's SO GOOD TO SEE YOU, MY DEAR. PLEASE COME IN
I'm GLAD THINGS HAV WORKED OUT FOR YOU
thank YOU, PLIAR. ME TOO
this IS NICK, HE'S
I know who he is.
you are interested in El Cucuy.
Yeah, a woman was attacked by a man that was killed.
and she says it was El Cucuy that saved her life.
I COULD SENSE IT ...
you COULD SENSE WHAT?
I could sense it was coming.
please sit.
when I was a child in Guadalajara, there was a time of great sorrow.
no one was safe.
the people of my neighborhood were being terrorized.
I was so scared I would sleep under the bed of my parents.
then one night,
I heard the woman next door calling,
her husband had been killed that day.
and I heard another woman calling, come and save us from this evil.
one house to the other, night after night, calling for help...
and just when I thought it would never get better, one of the evil men was dead on our street.
and then another was dead on another street.
and then a third, torn up like they had been attacked by wild dogs, until no evil men were left in our barrio.
have you ever seen El Cucuy? -No.
but one of the women on my street did.
we asked her what El Cucuy looked like.
she said its eyes glowed yellow, its teeth were sharp like razors, and its breath was foul like something who had eaten the dead.
and it could hear the cries of those in sorrow.
so you believe.
I believe El Cucuy wanders from place to place.
and it waits until it is called by voices of women who have suffered from evil.
if enough voices cry out, they become one voice that cannot be ignored.
then it wakes and hunts.
if El Cucuy is here, it is to answer that call.
I got nothing.
you find anything? -Lots.
this one is about a Grimm who tracked down and beheaded an entire family of Faeteo Fatalis in...
whoa, in 1655, who were wreaking havoc in Vlatos on the island of Crete.
but no. I haven't found anything that looks or sounds like El Cucuy.
it's a big world, maybe this is just one they haven't encountered yet.
or maybe it's in a book that was never handed down to my relatives.
who knows how much is still out there?
maybe it isn't even wesen.
well, look at you, just walking the streets like you own them.
this is not your neighborhood. It's mine.
disrespect me again, and they'll never find you...
or your mother.
you see something?
take care of this, Paul.
you got a positive on our attacker from last night... Stephen Stillman.
last known address, Vancouver, Washington.
any link between him, Otero, guzman, or Bolton? -None.
what about this Florez who keeps showing up at the crime scenes? - Florez lives with his mother.
a couple domestic disturbance calls.
he's a marine, did three tours in Afghanistan, diagnosed with PTSD.
this marine comes back from the war, suffering from PTSD, finds crime on the rise in his neighborhood, decides to do something about it.
kind of makes sense. We think he's our guy?
it could be. We're still working it.
surveillance footage from the bus last night just came in... any takers?
Yeah. Put it up.
this is from the 75 bus last night.
that's the victim, Ms. Ramos.
that's Stillman, the guy that attacked her.
and the guy in front of him is the one she thought was following her.
but he turned down another street.
well, he might have seen something, but he didn't come forward.
and we might want to think about talking to... -Hey.
don't we know her? -Yeah, she was at the convenience store robbery.
we brought her in for questioning. -Mrs. Garcia, right?
same woman at two crime scenes? -In the same area apparently.
I think you need to talk to her again.
David, what's wrong? -They let him out!
who? -The police! They let him out!
what are you talking about? Open the door.
mijo, open this door!
if the police are too scared to take care of him... -Mijo, open this door!
then I will.
David! Open this door! David, open this door!
who is it? -It's the police, Mrs. Garcia.
detectives Burkhardt and Griffin. We spoke with you the other night?
Oh, yes. I remember.
I-I'm always a little nervous about opening my door after dark.
would you like to come in? I can make you some tea.
actually, we'd like you to come down to the precinct with us.
have I done something wrong? -No, ma'am.
you were on the 75 bus last night. -Yes, I was.
how did you know? -There are surveillance cameras on the buses.
can... can I ask you what this is about?
we'd rather ask you a few questions at the precinct. There's some photos we'd like you to look at.
Oh, yes. Well, of course, if you need me to.
I'll just get my coat.
I gotta tell you, Nick, I don't think she's gonna be much help.
I hope you don't mind, but I don't get many handsome young men visitors anymore.
Oh. This is a nice car.
I bet it's fast. -When it has to be.
Burkhardt. Call just came in from David Florez's mother.
she's really upset. Said he came home furious that we let Bolton go.
I'm assuming that means he's going to Bolton's house to confront him.
how do you want to handle this?
meet us there. We can try to intercept him.
we got a problem with Florez. Apparently he's pretty upset that we let Bolton go.
mom called it in, thinks he might be going after Bolton. - Then we better go.
sorry, Mrs. Garcia. But we're gonna have to make a detour.
Oh, no problem. Whatever you need to do.
it sounds very exciting.
open the door!
I have come to disrespect you and everything you stand for.
you are going to leave this place or I'm gonna make you leave!
this is not your neighborhood!
you do not belong here! -This fool's gonna bring the police.
get this stuff outta here. I'll take care of him.
open the door!
what, you didn't get enough the first time?
stop! Police!
Hey, he came on my property with that knife. This is self-defense.
get back in your house. Arrest him.
I'm pressing charges, man. He tried to kill me!
get in the house or we'll arrest you.
let's call an ambulance. Let's get him into the car.
you shouldn't have let him go, man.
shouldn't have let him go. -Where is she?
she's not here. - Where'd she go?
dumbass cops, got nothin' on me. I told you guys to get out of here.
stay with him!
back away.
ay, Chihuahua. You're a Grimm.
I had no idea.
you're 77 years old. -Last month.
you killed guzman and Otero.
and Stillman, who attacked Ms. Ramos under the bridge.
I know it looks bad, but do you really think anyone is going to believe that I could do such things?
you're El Cucuy. -I've been called many things.
you have Bolton's blood all over you. -Well, yes, you brought me to Mr. Bolton's house.
and I heard the terrible screaming, I went in to help.
Oh, I must have gotten all bloody when I tried to save him.
"save him"? Really?
Oh, you don't need to worry about me anymore. I have done what I came to do.
the neighborhood is safe again. And I-I really should be moving on.
you really think we can just let you go?
well, I don't think you have any choice.
are you kidding me?
they are evil.
find THEM... FIND THEM...
you must help us. El Cucuy...
o Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree, How steadfast are your branches...
merry Christmas!
donations, please!
Hey, you guys have a merry Christmas now. Same to you too.
ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, dude.
let's go.
merry Christmas!
merry Christmas, dude.
my little princess mp3 player.
Santa must've found your list, Quinn. I'll take it.
I can get 50 bucks for it on eBay.
what was that? - I didn't hear anything.
Aw, dude. This is gonna be awesome.
a snow globe. - Aw, yeah.
who says Santa can't fly?
boom. - You've been naughty.
What'd you do? Bust out of that snow globe?
run! Run!
No!
what are you doing?
No!
Ow! Help me!
somebody get me out of here!
what's going on? No, no! No, help me!
austrian ALPS
Verrat.
sorry I'M LATE
there WAS AN ACCIDENT
good TO SEE YOU STILL ALIVE
you TOO
which LANGUAGE SHALL WE MEET IN?
english should suit everyone. Good.
Where's Breslau?
Breslau is dead. He betrayed us.
we almost missed meeting Sean Renard because of it.
so you are the royal bastard.
well, I am royal, and I can be a bastard.
I can be too.
we have been here longer than we should be.
let's get this meeting going.
good to meet someone who hates your family as much as I do.
it's good to meet someone who's not afraid to say that to my face.
I must get back before your cousin misses me.
be careful. - I'll try.
let's get started.
you gonna come by the shop today?
don't think so.
I hope you don't need me or anything. I mean, not that I don't want to be needed.
it's just, you know, I got a lot goin' on today.
gotta get those jobs out before Christmas 'cause, you know, clock repairs need to be timely.
is that a clock joke? - Just a very tiny one.
sorry. I heard it secondhand.
Yikes.
I'm leaving before you can think of anymore.
Bye. - Bye.
hurry, come in.
she didn't see you, did she?
no. - Okay, good.
where did you park? Down the street, like you told me.
okay, hurry up. We don't have a lot of time.
he cannot be trusted. The king is his father.
Yes, and his mother is a hexenbiest.
it is more important than ever that we coordinate our efforts, and that includes Sean Renard.
his brother's assassination has put pressure on all of us.
that is not a bad thing. We were not doing enough.
he should have been eliminated a long time ago.
sometimes, when you cut off the head of the snake, two grow back.
then you cut off both heads and gut the body. Eric's death was necessary.
we would not be much of a resistance if we did not resist.
no. His reasons are personal.
he hated his brother.
if his brother had been allowed to succeed, the families would've seen us weak.
I do not trust him. - And I don't trust you.
then we are nowhere, and we will be crushed.
this might be a good time for you to say something.
I can understand the reluctance that some of you feel.
however, my blood gives me access to people that we need.
I understand wesen in a way that many of you can't.
and I have a Grimm.
no one else brings all this to the table.
now, there is no guarantee that that will be enough, but we must trust each other or there will be no stopping the royal families.
they will dominate the world again, and those of us who are still alive will be kneeling before them and begging for whatever crumbs they throw at our feet.
well, we're no longer safe here.
the police just found three bodies of Verrat enforcers 50 Miles away at the scene of an accident.
I think it's time to go.
I'm not interested in kneeling before anyone or begging for crumbs.
nor am I.
I believe you are who we need.
we cannot waste this opportunity. There might not be another.
if any of you still disagree, let's deal with it now.
then we are decided.
you and I are in this together.
the M. E. is on the way. We've got one vic.
we matched these presents to a b-and-e on thurman about 9: 30 last night.
so somebody steals a bunch of presents, brings them here to see what they got.
maybe there was more than one of them? They got into a fight?
over this? - It's Christmas.
brings out the worst in people.
Hey, Wu.
what's this? I think it's coal.
lump of coal and stolen presents in the same place? Maybe it's not part of the crime scene.
I'll bag it just in case.
I found the body up here inside the car.
appears to be a teenage boy.
you know who it is? Not yet.
that jacket looks like it hasn't been here long.
somebody wrote "QB" on the tag.
and no I. D.
looks like blood on this. Let's take a look at the body.
I'll go in.
he's got some marks on his face.
might have a wallet in his back pocket.
not so dead.
victim's alive!
get the paramedics down here fast.
Rosalee hasn't seen all these stuffs? - No.
she's away last year taking care of her aunt.
kinda feel like you guys should be doing this together.
I mean, I understand the surprise and everything, but she's missing out on all the fun.
but this is our first official Christmas as a couple, you know?
there will be plenty of christmases for us to do this together, but you only get one chance to see it all for the first time, you know, to get the full impact before she sees it in the boxes 'cause if she just sees it like this, it's...
it's kinda daunting, actually. I mean, there's 42 boxes.
kinda wish you hadn't told me that.
the only way I can explain his reaction is that he saw something that scared the hell out of him.
what about the scratches on his face? Could've gotten those crawling into the car.
well, could he have been hit by a stick? I suppose so.
gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I need to finish my rounds.
you the cops that found my son? Yes, Detective Griffin and Burkhardt.
you know what happened? Yeah, we're still trying to piece that together.
did he say anything to you?
if I tell you, you gonna arrest him?
cause I think you should.
arrest him for what? - He stole those presents.
look, Derek is no stranger to trouble, but this time, I...
he really got himself into it.
how old is Derek? - 17.
we'll turn this over to juvenile. We think that he was attacked.
Yeah, and we found a leather jacket at the scene, had a "QB" written on the inside.
would that be Derek's? - QB.
no, he must've stole that too. Or maybe it's Quinn's.
kid Derek hung around with?
another loser. - Do you know his last name? Or where he lives?
sorry, I don't.
we need to talk to your son. All right, be my guest.
you remember us?
how you doin', Derek?
I'm okay, I guess.
can you tell us what happened last night?
somebody attacked you, right?
you get into a fight with somebody? Maybe with your friend Quinn?
no. - But Quinn was there.
where is he now?
I don't know. - Where did he go? Did he just run off?
no.
he took him.
he took him.
can you describe who that was?
I...
I can't.
Derek, if somebody took your friend Quinn, we need to know who.
what's Quinn's last name?
please don't let him get me.
don't let him take me! No, you're not taking me!
please don't let him take me! EVERYBODY ??????
don't let him take me. No, he's comin' in here to get...
we're gonna need to see some I. D.
well, what did I do? - Where were you last night?
right here on this floor. This is something I do this time of year.
I-I'm a plumber. You know, Al's plumbing on fourth?
I'm Al.
since when was spreading Christmas cheer a crime?
maybe Derek stole from the wrong Santa.
all right, thanks.
Derek's dad was right. His son had some problems.
he's 17, already has a rap sheet.
any luck finding Quinn? - I did.
name is Quinn Baxter. The "QB" in the jacket.
I could make that leap. He's got the same juvie officer as Derek.
you got an address for Quinn? Yes, I do.
thank you, Santa. - Oh, you're welcome, sweetie.
be good. There we go!
Hi, Santa. Ho ho ho! Well, my my.
he... he stole my bag! Stop him!
stop him! He stole my bag!
Oh, you've been naughty.
no. No! No!
stop!
stop! No, no!
he... help! Come on.
No!
No! Unh!
no, no!
stop! No, no!
what are you doin' over there?
help! Help!
do I need to call the cops?
No! No!
Vienna
Hank? That was fast.
they said we had to wait 24 hours. What are you doing here?
uh, well, Jerry is a good friend of mine. Here, come in, come in.
he and his wife... well... well, she died.
anyway, when he told me about Quinn, I-I came right over, and we called the police.
you gotta talk to him. He's worried sick.
Jerry! Jerry. Nick and Hank are here. I mean, the... the police.
they're... they're here. - We've called everyone.
we've looked everywhere. Is Quinn here?
Quinn? Why would you look for Quinn at home?
if he was home, he wouldn't be missing, which is why we called.
isn't that why you're here?
I just called. Thanks.
Jerry, Jerry, this is Nick Burkhardt and Hank Griffin.
they're detectives. I know them both really well.
did you find my son? - No, sir.
we were hoping he was here. I haven't seen him since yesterday.
he said he was gonna do some Christmas shopping. That's the last I saw him.
that's why I called the police. Isn't that why they're here?
do you know a Derek Bryce? Yeah, that's Quinn's friend.
I wish he wasn't. He's not a good kid.
I mean, he's pulled Quinn into some pretty bad situations. What does this Derek kid have to do with Quinn missing?
we found Derek with some stolen goods, and we believe he was attacked.
he's pretty scared. He's in the hospital now.
well, what about Quinn? - We found a jacket at the scene with the initials "QB" inside.
Oh, my God. That's Quinn's.
excuse me. Griffin.
do you have a photo of your son?
Yeah, sure.
okay. Here you go.
on our way. - Mind if we take this with us?
no, no, take it.
Nick, we got a call. We need to go.
well, now, wait a minute. What about my son?
sir, this may be related. We'll let you know as soon as we get something.
it's gonna be okay. They'll find him.
what did we get? Didn't want to say it in front of the dad.
just got a report of an abduction. Got an eyewitness. - What did they see?
Santa stuffing a kid into a bag.
show time.
Hey! Merry Christmas.
ha, ha! Well?
what do you think?
it's really...
Christmasy.
Christmasy.
well, yeah.
have you ever seen a 1935 Prewar Marklin set in this kind of mint condition?
no.
and how about that sangerknaben?
I mean, can they sing or what? It's nice.
and check this out.
here, we have an original Frederick Fuchtner Nutcracker.
I mean, he created the first nutcracker in like 1870 or something.
and here is a 1928
german putz reindeer, sleigh, and Santa set.
Oh, here's a little something you might be slightly more familiar with.
you like it.
you really like it.
I do.
I do.
but... But?
Really? There's a "but?
I, um...
I-I-I've never been much for the holiday stuff.
cause normally, people go kind of...
I mean, especially the kids. I'm sorry, it's...
it's really very...
what?
sad? What is going on?
it's nothing.
Rosalee, talk to me. What...
Christmas was a really big deal in my house growing up.
maybe not this big a deal, but...
anyway, my, um...
my Uncle Henry and my aunt Jeanette, they were my favorites.
they were loving, and funny, and full of life, and they always brought the best presents.
and the Christmas when I was seven, they were killed in a car accident.
they were coming to our house for Christmas Eve.
you never told me.
I should have.
but...
please.
I hate that I'm ruining your celebration.
it's really, really fantastic.
another lump of coal. - Nice calling card.
apparently, a kid on a skateboard grabbed a woman's shopping bag at O'Bryant Square.
a guy ran after him, lost him at the corner. But...
another guy came out of that stairwell heading for his car and saw a Santa...
holding a kid by his leg and stuffing him into a sack.
this witness yelled at the Santa, who turned and looked at him.
according to him, it wasn't like any Santa he'd ever seen before.
you get a description? Well, besides the red suit and the black boots, he looked like something out of, and I quote, "my worst drug-crazed, acid-induced flashback nightmare.
if you ask me, we're dealing with one sick Santa.
victim was robbed here, kid skated down these steps, disappeared.
and what about these Santas? Anybody check them out yet?
waiting for you.
let's start with the cart.
keep your eyes on the other kringles. Yeah.
you vant a brat?
how about on the house? How long have you been here?
all day. - Vendor's license.
come on, guys, it's Christmas. License.
take off the beard.
so where'd you do your time?
guys, this isn't right. I haven't done anything.
you sure about that?
Grimm.
Schakal.
Oh, NO - Where are the kids? - I didn't do anything!
where ARE THEY?
I told you. I didn't do anything!
why are they hurting Santa, mommy?
Adalind... Cameras in room, watching you.
we must talk. Seitenstrafe Cafe.
do not leave this note in your room.
stay five minutes, change your clothes.
smile, as if I brought something charming.
Nick, get in here! You're gonna wanna see this.
what?
this was the scene at O'Bryant Square last night.
caught on video by some bystanders who got a little more holiday excitement than they bargained for.
some are calling for an investigation of the police officers who roughed up this local Santa.
you arrested Santa?
we have two missing kids. Why aren't they mentioning them?
they should be decking the halls, not Santa.
Hi! Hi, Juliette. - Hey.
uh, I mean, good morning. Merry Christmas!
Nick! Nick, did you find Quinn?
I heard you made an arrest. You know, the Santa that you were beating up on TV?
that's the guy, right? We don't know yet, bud.
well, didn't you find anything? All we found were two lumps of coal.
I gotta get to work. Yeah.
soon as we know anything... I'll call you.
two lumps of coal. Did he say "two lumps of coal"?
I think so. Why?
Nah. No, it... can't be.
couldn't be!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! I gotta go.
don't worry.
I'm not gonna give you crap about arresting Santa Claus in front of a bunch of children.
but I wouldn't expect anything under the tree this year.
which leads me to the results I just got back on the lumps of coal we had analyzed.
according to the analysis, it comes from a mine south of Longyearbyen.
capital city of the Svalbard Islands.
where the hell is that? Northernmost tip of the arctic.
sometimes referred to as the north pole.
merry Christmas.
now what?
now we talk to somebody who believes in Santa.
I feel horrible.
it's our first official Christmas as a couple, and I've ruined it.
you didn't ruin it. - I ruined it.
you should've seen his face. Out of all the people Monroe could be with, he picks the one person who hates Christmas.
everything out there is... Red and green and...
I just... I just feel so blue.
I just want it all to be over. Monroe loves this holiday.
he's so cute.
I don't know what to do.
I'm sorry, I didn't really wanna drag you into this, but I didn't know who else I could drag into it.
it's okay, I'm already dragged in. I kinda helped him set it all up.
he called you for help? That is a big job, let me just say.
I'm not trying to convince you of anything.
this is really between you and Monroe, and I don't wanna get in the middle, but maybe you guys need to find a tradition that means something to both of you.
you mean I should bury the past? No! No, I'm just thinking of what Nick and I did.
he didn't have much of a Christmas tradition, because he was always moving from place to place, so...
he got stuck with mine, and...
we kinda figured out a way to make it ours.
I don't know.
just... it's been so long since I celebrated.
the only thing I really... Remember is beer and cigars.
beer and cigars?
my aunt used to leave Santa a cigar and a beer, instead of milk and cookies.
but I'm afraid that's not much of a tradition.
Hey, guys.
what happened?
Juliette said you decorated the entire place.
Yeah. We did.
I really don't wanna talk about it.
well, we got kind of an unusual... I guess Christmas just means different things to different people.
Rosalee didn't like it? It's not that she didn't like it, per se.
it's just Christmas is not a very happy time for her.
in fact, it's a dark, black hole of depression involving the death of her favorite aunt and Uncle.
sorry. What can I do?
can't force her to like Christmas.
anyway, what do you guys need?
well, remember a couple of years ago, I came over here.
you said you liked to dress up as Santa, and I said, "a Blutbad as Santa?
and you said you were no...
gefrieren Geber. Yeah, why?
we've got two missing kids.
and one witness describes the kidnapper as dressing up as Santa with a terrifying mask.
witness saw Santa stuff a kid in his bag and take off.
could that be the gefrieren... Whatever?
Oh, God, no.
we've got nothing. Sorry to bother you.
Oh, wait a minute.
there wasn't any coal left behind, was there? In both places.
does the gefrieren Geber do that? Forget the gefrieren Geber, 'cause...
this could be...
what? I hope I'm wrong.
but if I'm not, you guys could be dealing with something really awful.
these kids that were taken, were they doing anything that could be described or discerned as "naughty"?
well... Yeah.
stole a bunch of presents, and we think one kid was attacked by him.
okay.
did he have any kind of lash marks on his face or body?
Yeah. How'd you know?
Oh, boy.
that's gotta be Krampus.
he carries a switch and he beats the kids mercilessly with it.
wesen? Actually, I'm not really sure.
Krampus is like Santa's evil twin. He shows up before Christmas to punish the bad kids.
here we go.
the word Krampus derives from German for "claw.
and on the days leading up to Christmas,
Krampus grabs naughty kids, beats them with his switch, throws them in his sack, takes them deep into the woods and hangs them from the tallest tree.
hangs them? - Yeah. Not to kill them.
he just hangs 'em till he's ready to eat them.
he eats the kids? - Yeah, pretty much.
but not until the Eve of the winter solstice, the 21st.
which is today.
which means tonight is the night he feasts.
and according to the stories,
Krampus always disappears just after midnight on the winter solstice...
after all the children have been... Consumed.
so if he eats these kids before midnight, we don't have a lot of time to stop him.
finding a tree in Portland is like finding a needle in a thousand haystacks.
didn't you say it was the tallest tree?
not just the tallest tree, but the tallest tree in the tallest spot.
No! Let me go! Let me go!
please, I'm hungry.
I'm really cold. PLEASE
why are you doing this? What do you want?
I know you're there, please! I'm cold.
I wanna go home, please!
I'm sorry. - Let me out!
I'm so cold!
the trees are taller in Forest Park. - Forest Park is 5, 000 acres.
but that's not the tallest spot. That's council crest.
I think. That's 45 acres, give or take.
okay, What about Washington park?
it's right next to council crest, and it's got big trees too.
we don't have a lotta time. We're just gonna have to pick one.
I...
look, Bud... - Monroe. I need to talk to you about...
Nick! Look, Jerry's going crazy.
I've been telling him that you're doing everything you could possibly do.
but something you said bothered me. You said two lumps of coal.
and... Well, that can only mean one thing.
Krampus. - Krampus.
don't say that! He's not real!
we think we know where he's taking the kids.
Oh, my God, you do believe he's real.
kids? What do you mean kids? There's more than just Quinn.
and Krampus always takes the kids to the tallest tree in the tallest spot.
council crest? Well, at least I think it is.
let's do it. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
wait, wait, wait, wait. Do what? Do what?
uh, hey, Krampus is not real, you guys. Come on! He's not real!
you can't go after something that doesn't exist.
I mean, yeah. Sure, maybe when I was a kid... I thought he was real. But... but... but...
I don't... but not now!
you picking anything up?
I got nothing.
except the smell of fear...
on bud.
Hey, I wanna save those kids just as much as the rest of you.
I'm just not entirely comfortable with the idea that we might encounter the most hideous beast nobody's ever seen.
hold on.
tracks.
Oh, God.
Hey, guys! Guys!
some going up, some going down. We're running out of time, guys.
it's getting late. All right, spread out.
Hey, guys, wait, wait. Shouldn't we be spreading out closer together?
help! Please! Hey, wait a minute.
help!
help!
I hear something.
this way.
can anyone hear me? - Look.
is someone down there? Hello?
Hello?
did you hear that? - Guys, I heard someone!
Oh, my God! It's... it's real!
we made it. Get us down!
they're still alive. Get us down!
please help us! Get us down!
I WANNA GO HOME
help us! Please help!
Quinn! Quinn, are you up there?
Yeah. Yeah! I'm here. Get me down. - UP HERE - Get us all down! - Get the ropes!
all right, you're gonna be okay.
let me go. Where are you taking me? I said I was sorry.
get me out of here! Get me out of here!
Oh, my God. - Please!
it's okay. It's okay, you're almost down. Hang on.
okay. You all right? Come on.
we gotta help Nick.
bud, stay with the kids. - Good idea.
all right, kids, everybody here? You're all gonna be okay.
what is he? - That's Krampus.
you can see him? Yeah, sure wish I couldn't.
we can't take him in looking like this.
I think you're gonna have to holster your badge on this one, Nick.
we can't just kill him on the ground. He kidnapped six kids.
and if we hadn't gotten there in time, they would've been Christmas dinner.
well, maybe you should do it. Uh, well...
you're the Grimm.
and it's not really a Blutbad thing to... mete out justice.
he's waking up.
we need to handle this.
if you try to take Krampus in, you'll have a hell of a time explaining it.
come on, Nick.
this is what your ancestors did, okay, sometimes for the good of all of us.
we can't arrest him and we can't let him go.
this is not an innocent man, Nick.
he's wesen. If you don't wanna do this, I will.
Oh, sorry.
midnight.
where am I?
what's going on?
what are you doing?
how did I get here?
Oh, no. It happened again.
it happened again! No!
I sort of black out, and then I can't remember anything.
it happens every December.
I don't know when it starts, but I always wake up on the 22nd.
sometimes there's blood! I don't know where it came from!
I just know that I always find myself in the woods and...
dressed like this.
well, you're a long way from salt lake city.
you still live there? Yeah, for three years now.
how'd you get to Portland? Portland? I...
I can't remember. You working?
Yeah, I'm a freelance photographer. I do weddings and family portrait...
listen, I swear I didn't do anything.
I just shoot pictures! I didn't do anything. I'm innocent.
I'm innocent! I swear!
what kinda wesen are you? What kinda what?
wesen. - Wesen?
I'm sorry, I... I don't know what that is.
at midnight, he reverted from Krampus into a 42-year-old photographer from salt lake city...
who had no recollection of what had happened over the last three weeks.
that could be why Krampus has never been caught.
how does he not know he's wesen?
because if he's in an altered state of mind, he wouldn't.
my guess, this guy's only woged for these three weeks out of the year, kind of in a blackout.
and once he's Krampus, he can't come out of it until the winter solstice.
I mean, maybe it's triggered by the changing sunlight or something, like an extreme case of seasonal affective disorder.
you mean like when it gets dark, he gets darker. Yeah, it's like a Jekyll and Hyde thing.
so what are we gonna do with him?
we're not gonna get a conviction.
nobody can identify him. Until next year.
why don't we turn this one over to the wesen council?
let them deal with it. Works for me.
I'll talk to Rosalee.
so what happened to you? - Zip-lining in Kauai.
tore my achilles.
someone outside the family is carrying royal blood. Who is the unlucky man?
it's one of two, and they happen to be brothers.
you wanted to see us? Gonna be leaving town for a little while.
you in some kind of danger?
been a long time since I've been back.
and we're doing our best that nobody finds out.
to KILL KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS, FIRST YOU MUST FIND HIS SOUL,
which IS HIDDEN IN AN EGG, IN A DUCK IN A LEAD CHEST BURIED BENEATH AN OAK TREE.
morning.
Hello?
Juliette, it's Alicia.
what's wrong? It's Joe.
I gotta get out of here, okay? I can't take it anymore.
I'm leaving him. - Are you hurt?
Yeah.
okay, then you need to come, and you're staying with us.
I'm just afraid of what he'll do when he finds out I left.
all right, you need to get in the car and come to Portland right now.
I don't know, I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't do this.
no, listen, it's gonna be okay, but you have to get out of there.
all right, so get in the car and call me from the road.
okay.
okay, thanks.
did you run? Yep.
you're not sweating.
I know. Weird, isn't it?
my friend Alicia just called.
Alicia who's married to that idiot? Joe, and yes.
she needs a place to stay.
he hit her again.
well, DIDI SHE REPORT IT?
no, I think she's too scared to do anything besides just get out of there right now.
do you want me to get into it? - No, not yet.
not until we have a chance to talk to her. I just wanted you to know she's coming.
she can stay here as long as she needs to, but you have to make sure she does not talk to Joe while she's here.
he cannot know where she is. Okay, thanks.
Really? Just pretending we like each other.
I like pretending.
why are you in Vienna?
did you miss me? I did, actually.
who put cameras in my room? Who's paying your hotel bills?
hmm. You're still here.
you know, the family...
they get very paranoid when one of their own gets killed.
so they're spying on me.
well, anything to hide? - What's left to hide?
nothing, if they know you're pregnant.
see, there's a rumor going around that's someone's trying to sell a child with royal blood.
who's the father? You mean is it yours?
is it?
you worried about paying child support?
one thing you can be sure of, when this becomes known...
and soon enough, it will...
you're going to have to choose a side.
see, everyone will be interested in that child but not so much you.
you don't have that many friends you can trust, if any.
and there will come a time when you need one.
Portland _
_
_
you WILL BE WELL. I PROMISE
I'm fine. I'm fine.
you're not fine. You need some tea.
how do you feel?
I still feel the pain. And you will.
you will for a few hours, days maybe.
it will stop. You will see.
how much do I have to pay you?
live a long, happy life. That's payment enough.
allo.
did you find out?
tonight?
tonight, there's gonna be a lot of people there.
maybe it's better.
okay, give me the address.
Yeah.
tonight, we'll pay him back.
Pozhaluista. A toast, please.
I am honored to have Boris Myshkin, the great healer...
what he did today is a miracle...
and his lovely wife Olga in my restaurant on this special night.
may God grant you the health that you have granted to so very many.
na zdorov'ye. - Spasiba.
Spasiba. Thank you.
Dima, Mila, I'm the one who's honored.
but You showed so much kindness.
generosity.
generosity to Olga and me.
we are very happy.
dance, eat, drink, muzyka!
Alicia's not answering her phone again.
well, it could be out of battery or no service.
what if Joe found out she was leaving?
I'm sure he has by now.
maybe that's her.
it's her.
I was so worried about you. Why didn't you answer your phone?
I'm sorry, the battery was out, and I left my charger, so...
Hey, Alicia. - Hey, Nick.
we're gonna help you get through this.
Yeah, you're gonna be all right, and the guest bedroom's all ready for you.
has Joe tried to call you? - Yeah.
like, a million times. Have you talked to him?
no, Juliette told me not to, so...
good, we don't want him to know where you are.
have you eaten? - No, I don't...
um, I don't think I can right now.
you've got to eat... I'll make something light, and I'll get you a glass of wine.
this isn't your fault, you know.
I'm sorry.
what? - Nothing.
Nah, I just, uh, gotta put the room in the bag.
come here.
you know, you put me through so much pain, kind of feels like we're married.
it sounds like you've been married before. Yeah, you could say that.
didn't work out?
you can say that too.
least you tried. Yeah.
how's that feel?
better.
good, well, one more session and we should be done.
only one more, really? We've been at it for eight weeks.
you better be getting better, or I should be looking for another job.
well, I can't say it's all been fun, but, uh, maybe we should celebrate.
uh, you know, like a graduation kind of thing.
sorry, I didn't mean to...
no, it's... it's all right, I just...
I try to keep everything on a professional...
right, that's... that's always good.
I was wondering when you were gonna come back.
how was it?
well, the Verrat paid a personal call.
they found out you were there.
let's just say there was an indiscretion, but we handled it.
I'm guessing you didn't make any arrests.
there's a great deal at stake here, Nick. Allegiances are shifting.
my brother's death has caused a great deal of turmoil. Too bad I didn't get a chance to meet your brother.
I would've liked to see that.
they find out you were involved?
they're not certain of anything except that you and I pose a great threat.
welcome back, Captain.
sorry to interrupt, but somebody got themselves killed. Anybody interested?
prep cook found the victim between the petit escargot and chocolate mocha, which makes him our special for today.
special got a name? - Ivan markov.
24, waiter here, clocked in at 2: 00.
any sign of his clothes?
street clothes are in his locker, but his uniform's missing.
somebody killed him for his uniform? Anything else missing?
no, money, booze all accounted for. Got some bruising around his neck.
strangled. - And no sign of a struggle.
you haven't seen the storeroom.
blood on the floor. - Broken window.
now we're talking struggle.
Oh, maybe the killer went out the window.
Where's the owner? - Waiting to talk to you.
I thought markov got sick and went home.
you look for him, call his house?
we were short-staffed. I got busy.
we were closed for a private party. You have a guest list?
the woman who booked the party is a personal friend,
I can give you her number.
staff get along with markov? - As far as I know.
show us your surveillance.
this is the guy we think killed the waiter. He knows there's cameras.
that's why he's carrying the box. And this is him ten minutes later.
is that the storeroom? - Yeah.
he goes in, never comes back out.
so he kills the waiter, steals the uniform.
what's the motive?
this guy.
boris Myshkin, guest of honor.
the killer must have needed the uniform as a disguise.
Myshkin? I've heard of him.
he's some sort of Russian healer. Sounds like a scam artist to me.
according to the restaurant owner, Myshkin is staying with this woman,
and this is his wife Olga.
how does Olga feel about them?
what, his groupies?
doubt she calls 'em that. - Mm.
any idea who the assailant is? Not yet, lab's still trying to clean up the image.
and no one reported the assault? No.
we believe Myshkin threw his attacker out the window.
and he went back to the party like nothing happened.
so the guy who attacked him could still be on the loose.
if someone tried to kill Myshkin, there's no reason to think he won't try it again.
we need to talk to Myshkin. We're dealing with Russian citizens.
if the state department decides to get involved, I'd like to stay in front of this one.
I'm coming with you.
allo.
it's too late now.
I don't know how, but he killed me.
you have to be strong.
no, no tears.
I failed.
I love you.
_
I brought you some towels.
put them on the dresser and get out.
you should call home like I do.
it's not good to forget where you come from.
you think Myshkin cares for you, any of you?
I'm sorry I disturbed you.
_
I wish all my crimes took place in.
you should know that in Russia these healers are revered.
so are circus clowns.
well, this one threw a guy through a window.
we're looking for Boris Myshkin. Please wait in here.
I am Mila Guryanova. This is my home.
the Myshkins are my guests.
what do you want with my husband?
we need to ask him a few questions concerning a police investigation.
now is not a good time. He's doing a healing.
this shouldn't take too long.
this way.
my boy's wound won't heal.
it never heals. It just gets worse.
it's hot.
what do you see? - Something with his hand.
it's healed.
you've done it.
Spasiba. My boy is healed.
Spasiba, spasiba.
he's done it. I can't believe it.
sorry for the interruption. I'm Captain Renard.
this is Detective Burkhardt, Detective Griffin.
what do you want? You had a party at a restaurant last night.
a waiter was murdered there.
what happened? - Olga.
according to restaurant surveillance, the man who killed the waiter also tried to kill you.
dont TELL THEM. WE MUST BE CAREFUL - Olga, please.
_
_
_
_
why am I not surprised? You told your wife you'd tell the truth.
I have nothing to hide.
a man attacked me. I fought back.
you ever seen this man before? - No.
but he too spoke Russian.
he's saying...
what's that mean?
doesn't really translate, but if you're gonna kill somebody you hate, it certainly fits the occasion.
any reason why this man hates you enough to kill you?
Ah, many.
many reasons.
sometimes...
sometimes I try to heal someone, and I fail.
some say I do the devil's work.
some men are jealous because their foolish wives fall in love with me, but that, I can't help.
what happened to the man who attacked you?
I threw him out the window. He ran away.
you should've reported it.
if I'd known he already murdered someone, I would've.
it's possible he may try again, so I'm gonna leave a patrol unit parked just outside in case.
if you see anything suspicious, please give us a call immediately.
here THE POLICE ARE NOT USELESS
is Myshkin in trouble?
would YOU CARE IF HE WAS?
he's A GREAT MAN
great MEN HAVE FAULTS
that's TURE
where did you learn to speak Russian? I spent a couple years in Moscow when I was younger.
you SPEAK THE LANGUAGE VERY WELL
Spasiba. Do svidaniya.
do svidaniya. - What'd you see?
the skin on Myshkin's hand became transparent when he was healing that kid.
I could see his bones. Could you?
no, no, but what you're describing is a Koschie.
I remember meeting one once with my mother in Moscow.
he was a healer just like Myshkin.
he wore these long monk's robes, he didn't drink, and according to my mother, he was celibate, which is why he came to her.
evidently, the healing fired up his sex drive, and he needed a potion to put the brakes on.
Myshkin's libido could use some of that.
man likes to party.
Oh, doesn't seem to be suffering too much guilt about his marriage.
or maybe he's suffering too much. He is Russian after all.
I'll call a few friends in Moscow, see what I can find out.
housekeeping.
Oh, my God!
looks like this stuff barely survive the fire.
a lot of loose pages here, all in Russian.
this stuff is totally burnt.
also all in Russian. Maybe we should've brought the Captain.
here? - Yeah.
I don't think so.
okay, try to find anything in English.
Stalin... looks like he used Malin Fatal as bodyguards.
that's nice.
Ah, English, at last.
december 1, 1916.
lieutenant oswald Carter, St. Petersburg, Russia.
ozzie, received your dispatch.
Rasputin's influence over tzarina "and his call to remove Russian troops from the front "devastating to allied cause.
your plan approved. "God save king George.
sir Ian Hastings, British secret intelligence bureau.
Rasputin? He's in here too?
the mad monk? Guess so.
okay, this looks like a journal entry.
Rasputin was a Koschie.
figures, I knew he was wesen.
captain said Myshkin was a Koschie.
you know anything about them?
huh? No.
Koschie are, you know, Russian, which means they're Greek to me.
because of their healing powers, "they are extremely difficult to kill, "but one must be especially careful.
a Koschie's touch can not only heal but also be fatal.
how do you know which one you're going to get?
there's more about Rasputin here.
when the poison proved ineffective, "I instructed Yusopov to just shoot the bastard.
unfortunately, he fired only one shot.
I quickly shot him three more times with my webley.
still, this wasn't enough to kill him.
we had to beat him senseless "and dump him in the icy waters of the neva river.
ironically, British intelligence had no idea they had sanctioned a Grimm to kill a wesen.
where?
we're on it. Gentlemen, we have a body.
well, this is where I say do svidaniya, comrades.
moscow _
_
_
how are things? - Nothing changes.
the royals are ruling behind another puppet strongman, and we are living off cheeseburgers.
what about Boris Myshkin?
Ah, an interesting man, albeit an evil one.
before he became a healer, he was an assassin.
for who? - The FSB.
how's he work?
his victims all die a terrible death from radiation poisoning.
how he does it, no one knows.
paramedics took one look and called Oregon public health.
they think he was exposed to something toxic.
I've seen enough. Yeah, me too.
room's registered to an Alex Renko.
manager said he paid in cash, but he had a Moscow driver's license.
another Russian. - Got something here.
Markov's uniform from the restaurant.
so the dead guy in the tub killed the waiter and attacked Myshkin.
that's some badass justice.
got a cell phone over here.
looks like a burner. All the calls are to the same number.
could be an accomplice. Let's see who he was talking to.
the number you have reached is no longer in serv...
I guess the accomplice is not stupid.
Oh! Jeez!
HazMat's here. They said don't...
touch the... oh.
sorry, Detectives, but you have to be decontaminated.
you'll surrender your clothes and undergo exfoliation.
Exfoliation? That means you'll have to shower.
you'll also need to take potassium iodide.
anyone allergic? Ugh.
let's get some swabs off the victim.
seal off the other room.
I've had to take a few cold showers before, but nothing like this.
can't believe soap and water's gonna be enough. Scrub hard.
how long you think it takes before you show signs of radiation sickness?
that depends on the level of exposure.
killer must have got a pretty high dose... I hope.
well, he didn't look sick on the restaurant surveillance. Oh, not before he walked into the storeroom anyway.
that must have been where he got exposed. And by exposed you mean...
to Myshkin.
we better tell them to check out the restaurant storeroom.
that's pretty hot over here. What's your reading?
you guys are clear. Don't forget to take your potassium iodide.
what about our clothes? They have to be incinerated.
you're lucky, could've been a lot worse. Just heard back from our team at the restaurant.
you were right.
that storeroom is hot.
Hey, who you gonna call?
you dress blues, huh? Nice booties.
you okay?
they cleared us. - We feel like idiots.
no comment. So...
what do we know about our suspect? So far, just his name.
Alex Renko. - They've got him in isolation.
he's dying of radiation poisoning.
had to be Myshkin. He's definitely a Koschie.
we found out they can kill or cure with their touch. Fits with what I got.
turns out Myshkin was a paid assassin for the FSB. Sounds like his sins have come back to haunt him.
let's bring him in, see what he'll admit to.
you shouldn't have come here.
I told you,
I don't want this for you.
you have to leave him.
he will kill you too.
if you really want to keep gizmo from getting into fights, you have got to neuter him.
I know, but my husband won't let me.
well, he's probably gonna be out for another hour, so if you want to get coffee or anything...
are you sure he'll be okay? Yeah, he'll be fine until the next time.
I should just neuter you anyway, gizmo, spare you a lot of pain and suffering.
go ahead. I won't tell.
we talking about a cat? Well, it wouldn't be that difficult, would it?
I mean, a cat, - a man... - Joe.
that's terrible, to even think about doing that in the middle of the night when he's drunk and passed out, say, like, on a Friday at 9: 30, and we had a really, really good alibi.
you know you can never go back. Yeah, I know.
not this time, I'm... - Never.
there's no way in hell I'm ever going back.
unless...
it's Friday at 9: 30 and we have a...
really good alibi. - Really good alibi.
you know a man named Alex Renko? Should I?
you poisoned him with radiation two days ago.
and you used to work for the FSB.
we know you're a Koschie.
I saw you heal that boy.
you saw it?
okay.
now I know what you are.
how about the rest of you? No.
it's a long story.
why did Renko want you killed? I promise you I don't know.
I'm sorry for what I did to that man.
he attacked me. I had no choice.
Yes, I was assassin for the FSB.
but I wanted to find peace and do penance for the pain I caused, so I swore an oath to God to only do good, heal the sick.
my concern is not your redemption.
my concern is that Renko has an accomplice - who may still be after you. - Ah.
I'm already a dead man, mister.
and every time I heal, I die a little more.
if someone tries to kill me, I'm not gonna fight it again.
why should I? Soon I will be in hell.
well, I suggest that you leave the country immediately.
my wife misses her home.
she would be happy to return.
you're free to go. Ah, I can go.
free...
I'm not.
all right.
I understand. Renko's awake.
if we want to talk to him, this may be our only chance.
let's go.
says Myshkin killed his father, and he's gonna kill her too.
Myshkin's wife? He didn't give a name.
Alex said Myshkin murdered his father. Is anyone at the house related to him?
there's a lot of possibilities. Including his wife if she's related to Alex.
and Larissa the housekeeper. - Or one of his groupies.
if Alex is afraid for someone at the house, it must be someone who's with Myshkin now.
so you should be happy. You get to go home.
are you coming with me?
do you still care?
I don't know anymore.
can I get you anything?
mm, let's think.
um, let's start with vodka.
need help?
not here, where she can see us.
Why? Afraid we'll make a scandal?
I love to make a scandal.
come.
_
no, no, no. I'm right here.
I need to help you. I need to help you... - Oop, oop, oop, oop, oop.
finish your drink first.
I want you now.
I think you need to drink more.
I think you need to love more.
Larissa... oy.
you're playing too hard to get.
why don't you die? I'm having so much fun.
why die? Don't touch me.
what's wrong, huh?
you killed my father.
what? - And now you killed my brother.
they were my whole life.
I poisoned you. Why don't you die?
who are you?
it was my Saint's name day.
I was only ten years old.
my father went to the car to get me a present, and you killed him.
Sergei Komarov was your father?
no, no, no, no.
no, you... you don't understand.
I'm not the same man.
you can never make up for what you've done.
I'm not the same man. I don't kill.
I heal.
I'm NOT A MONSTER
forgive ME
forgive me. Please forgive me.
I'll take the back. All right.
police! Open up!
what is the problem?
Where's your husband? - Upstairs in our bedroom.
he's got that little whore with him.
I told you, I'm not that man anymore.
I've changed. - Stay back.
Mysha, what happened? - She stabbed me.
larissa, come here.
let her go. - Olga!
No!
get down!
Grimm.
you heard the man. On the floor!
he killed his .
I don't think she's gonna make it.
I can't stop this bleeding. Move.
move. I can help. Stay back.
I don't think we have another choice.
No! She tried to murder you.
Mysha, Mysha! Don't, don't!
it will kill you. You are too weak.
No!
No!
you fool.
forgive me.
you fool.
this is Burkhardt. We need an ambulance.
3500 Lovejoy.
Nick? - Yeah.
we're in the kitchen.
are you hungry? We saved you a plate.
mm, thanks.
how'd it go today? - It was fun.
Alicia came to work with me and helped treat cats and dogs.
and one parrot. His name was, uh...
he was pretty chatty. So you had a good day?
Yeah, yeah. I did.
look, guys, I know this is such an imposition, - and I promise you that... - Will you stop?
she's been doing this all day. I'll get the phone.
so has Joe tried calling again today?
I TURNED off my phone.
that's good. - She's not here, Joe.
I don't know where she is. She's not here.
no, you're not hearing what I'm saying.
let me talk to him. Hey, Joe, it's Nick.
you don't want to do this. - I'm looking for my wife!
this is none of your damn business, Detective.
well, I'm not talking to you as a cop... yet.
you need to calm down.
the hell I do! Is she there?
just tell me if she's there. Damn it, I know she's there!
if Alicia left you, I'm sure she did it for a pretty good reason.
do you want to tell me about it? Joe.
he hung up.
does he know that I'm here? He's probably calling all of your friends.
if he knows that I'm here, then he will come here. Well, then we'll just deal with it.
look, Nick, you don't... you don't understand, okay?
he's...
he's... he's not normal.
well, let's hope he's normal enough not to do anything stupid.
Joe? ALI
the attack was pretty violent. No!
somebody had a really big knife and a really bad temper.
looks like a black knight - with blood on it.
she's a Grimm. - You've heard that before.
it doesn't mean anything.
so Theresa's staying for dinner? Nobody calls me Theresa.
Uh-huh, so what do they call you? They call me Trubel.
Trubel... that's an interesting name.
Trubel might have to be staying with us for a little while.
she needs to lay low.
this have to do with a case? - Little more than that.
and by little more, you mean... She's a Grimm.
she's a... - Yeah.
sounded just as weird to me too. You're a Grimm, but...
she just found out.
can I talk to you for a second? Excuse us.
how do you just find out you're a Grimm? Uh, sort of like me.
I had no idea what I was until aunt Marie told me, and she's never had anybody tell her.
then how do you know she's a Grimm?
Monroe saw her. - Monroe saw her?
and she killed three wesen. She's a murder suspect?
well, not technically a suspect, because we know she did it, but it was self-defense.
they attacked her. She has no idea what she is, let alone what they were.
first your mom shows up with Adalind and a baby.
and now you bring home a Grimm who barely knows she's a Grimm, and she's killed three wesen.
I know it's a lot. - You think?
she's been on the run for years. I mean, she thought she was crazy.
she just needs a little help. You really think you can help her?
I took her to the trailer, tried to explain what she was as best I could, but that's a lot to take in for someone as young as she is.
Juliette, she just needs a warm bed, a roof, and a little understanding.
for how long? Well, a little while.
I think we're gonna have to play it by ear. Where is she?
sorry. - It's okay.
why don't we try some silverware and eat at the table, though?
it's been a while since I ate with other people.
I am so sorry.
that's all right. - I am so sorry.
it's just an accident. We'll take care of it.
security. I'm gonna need to see what's in your bag.
let go of me.
nice. Very nice.
Garmani. Very good.
something go wrong?
I'll take that as a yes.
Where's Cammy? She, um...
she made a mistake.
was she caught?
was Cammy caught?
I saw her run away. - And you didn't go after her?
we... we thought she'd meet us back here.
we'll discuss it upstairs.
bless this family and this food we are about to eat.
we take nothing for granted, for we know that our strength comes from putting the family first.
for no sacrifice is too great...
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I know. Come on.
it wasn't my fault.
I know.
why don't we talk about this in private?
okay
at least I got away. You shouldn't have gotten caught.
I won't get caught again. Please.
I came home.
and where else would you go?
look at me.
this is your family.
and without family, you're nothing.
would you like seconds?
so are all of the grimms so normal?
you should meet my mother.
she's been called a lot of things, but normal's not one of 'em.
does that mean we're related? - Maybe a few centuries ago.
from what I can tell, it's like a recessive gene.
must be a relief to know you're not the only one at least.
so you see these wesen things too? No, I'm not a Grimm.
so how do you deal with this?
deal with what?
you know, being married to someone who can see what we do?
um, we... We're not married.
smart.
you can get out any time.
Hey, here's a clean pair of pants and a shirt for you to sleep in.
I'm fine with what I have. - Okay, cool.
well, I'm just gonna leave it there in case you change your mind.
we are down the hall if you need anything. I won't, but, uh, thanks for the Chinese.
no problem. Good night.
how long am I supposed to stay here?
till I can figure out what to do.
look, if you need me, call me, okay? I don't want you to go.
I'll be right across the hall. - You need to stay here with me.
I'm not so sure that's a good idea.
you afraid of me? - YEAH, Of course I'm afraid of you.
well, I'm afraid of you too. Then why do you want me to stay?
because I'm more afraid of being alone.
I'll take the couch. No, you won't.
I had a child to hold. I don't anymore.
but for the short time I had her,
I felt something I've never felt before.
I did too.
I never felt like I needed anyone before.
do you think Viktor will take care of her?
I believe she will be well looked after.
will we ever see her again?
I don't know.
No! No! No!
would you be more comfortable in a jail cell?
because that's where you're gonna end up if you walk out on this.
you don't owe me anything. I know the world you've been living in.
I can help.
why do you care?
because I'm like you. It's not easy.
Plus, I had help, and you didn't.
look.
I haven't quite worked this out, but I just think this might help us both.
you might have seen some things I haven't.
besides, I like having another Grimm around.
is she staying?
for now.
a lot for her to learn.
where are you gonna start?
hello. Nick.
Yeah, just one second, he's doing his exercises.
put him on speaker. So how'd it go last night?
everybody still alive? Yeah, for the time being.
look, I need your and Rosalee's help with her.
and by help, you mean...
what you did for Juliette.
Oh. - Nick, this girl is a Grimm.
she can already see us. WHAT... - No, no, no.
she's used to every wesen trying to kill her.
she needs to know that... We're not all bad.
this is the next step.
all right, all right, Nick. Just tell her to leave that machete behind.
she has a machete? - Thanks, I appreciate it.
Delta! - Delta, come here!
I see him. - Delta!
what are you digging at? - Bad dog.
Oh, my God.
Hi, Nick, Hank.
this is... Trubel.
come on in.
well, I'm Rosalee.
fuchsbau.
right.
and I hear you met Monroe yesterday.
Yeah.
I never really had a chance to properly introduce...
blutbad.
Yeah.
you, uh, really got a thing for clocks. Oh, yeah.
big fan of time in general.
I mean, you think about it... history, music, love.
a long life, right? None of it would work without...
timing.
and speaking of, we might want to get these other introductions out of the way.
so why don't we just start with explaining what a woge is?
I know what it is.
okay, well, there's also, like, um, stages.
so there's Kehrseiten. And they are non-wesen, non-Grimm types.
that would be me.
and they can only see us when we want them to.
and grimms, like you, on the other hand, also can see us when we don't wanna be seen.
you ready?
here goes.
see?
no big deal.
see, everything's fine.
how do you know I'm a Grimm?
it's your eyes.
they get really dark when we woge.
it's kind of scary. Really?
Yeah, we're not talking kiddy pool dark.
we're talking, like, all the way down to your soul, deep-type dark.
cool.
Burkhardt. - So that went well, right?
still friends?
this is so weird.
you know, everybody telling me what I saw wasn't real,
I made it up.
well, honey, you didn't.
look, this is new for... for all of us.
Nick is the first Grimm who didn't try to kill us.
so this is as important for Monroe and me as it is for you.
but not all wesen are like us.
so you need to be careful.
okay.
we gotta go. There's a body in forest park.
what about Trubel?
we can take her with us. How are we gonna explain that?
ride along. Yeah, we can say she's a, uh...
what?
criminology student?
Oh, perfect. - Great idea.
that's the best.
your mother's house went through probate.
it was determined at that time that your mother had not filed taxes for the last seven years.
once legal fees, the irs, and the state were paid, there was a balance of $1, 500. 42, most of which has gone to pay the storage unit where her personal possessions have been stored as per your request.
it's a good thing you showed up when you did.
rent's only paid through the end of the month.
it would've gone up for auction in 60 days.
I hope she left something of value for you in there.
were you close with your mother?
I didn't mean...
I had such high hopes for you, honey.
I was everything to her.
Hey. Where do you think you're going?
with you... isn't that what I'm supposed to be doing?
no, this is a crime scene. This might not have anything to do with wesen.
don't I wish.
Hey, it's not like it's the first dead body I've ever had to deal with.
just keep your voice down.
the fewer questions people ask about you, the better.
what do we got? - Uh, another weird one.
looks like the vic was exsanguinated.
what's that?
this is Theresa. Criminology student.
she's here for a ride along. Oh, thinking of becoming a cop?
right.
well, it means that the victim has lost all of her blood.
crime scene's this way.
try to just watch and listen.
that's what I'm doing. Body's wrapped in plastic.
fully clothed, buried about 6 inches under.
who found it? Dog named delta and his two owners.
out for a run. Looks like some high-end clothes.
cuts don't look like they were made by a blade. Looks like puncture wounds.
doesn't look like she's got a drop of blood left. Gotta be wesen.
who's "Vesson"?
you were saying?
it's, uh... German.
Yeah, it means that, you know, "there's no blood left.
okay, uh, you guys ready for me to run prints? Yeah.
scanner's in the car. I'll be right back.
you've got to understand, these are cops.
you can't go talking that stuff to just anybody.
sorry. - I think she's right, though.
Yeah, I know she's right.
you okay?
she's young. What the hell kind of wesen makes marks like that?
trailer. - Right.
not much here, Jenny. I thought someone saw me.
whoa, what's the matter? I didn't want you to think that...
what? - That I'm like Cammy.
don't worry, nothing bad is gonna happen to you.
unless you do get caught, 'cause then they'll want you to talk.
I wouldn't. Tell me why you wouldn't.
because I love our family.
we all miss Cammy.
the family needs someone to take her place.
Donna. - Yes.
find us another one.
you know, I think it may be time to move the trailer.
Yes, That's not a bad idea. I've seen one of those.
Wendigo.
where did you see it? Chicago.
dude picked me up, offered me dinner.
then I found out I was supposed to be the main dish.
Yeah, we ran across one of those. You cut off its head?
no, we shot him. Oh, I guess that works.
you wouldn't happen to have an extra gun, would you?
can we just stay focused on this?
Hey, check this out.
same markings as on our vic.
you recognize it? You remember Ryan?
the intern?
how could I forget?
um, sauger.
Lebensauger. That's German, right?
Yeah. - Yeah, I'm getting this.
Lebensaugers are known for coercing their victims through fear.
hang on.
Sgt. WU WORK
wu, you're on speaker. Got a juvenile record on your victim.
took me a while to get it cleared. Camila Reynolds, age 18.
arrested three times, the latest for shoplifting six months ago.
last known address, the new beginnings halfway house downtown.
thank you. - Hey, Wu.
can you check with robbery? See if any high-end stores have been hit recently.
anything with young girls. Yeah, you got it.
let's hit that halfway house. You think you can...
what is it?
Siegbarste.
that's what killed my foster parents.
that's why you ran away?
Yeah, it would've killed me too if I hadn't.
did you see who it was?
no, only that...
that it was a monster.
that's... that's why I ran.
well, I think you've had enough for one day.
I can take you home. No.
no, I'm done running.
it better be here.
new BEGINNINGS
no, you need to stay in the car this time.
fine with me. Been in and out of places like this too many times.
should be somewhere in the backlog. Here it is.
such a shame.
she was a sweet girl.
well, it says here Camila attended several job interviews.
it's mandatory for the girls to go to job interviews before they emancipate.
once they're 18, they have to leave. There's only so many beds.
any of the jobs pan out? Cammy was a sweet girl, but she never thought very highly of herself.
not a rare thing in girls who have no family.
she hang out much with any of the other girls here? Anyone she was close to?
her roommate Megan. - Megan still here?
Yes, you can talk to her.
but she's gonna be pretty upset if you tell her what happened to Cammy.
Jeane, have you seen Megan?
no. - See if you can find her.
I wanna speak with her. Yes, ma'am.
Hey, there are cops inside, and they're looking for you.
Yeah.
I'd get out of here. - Okay.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Megan, could you talk to these guys for a second?
sure. - Thank you.
Hey, Megan.
can you answer a few questions about Cammy? Yeah.
she mention any boyfriend? - Not to me.
anybody here you think she might have confided in? No.
places like this, you learn your problems are exactly that:
yours.
well, if you do remember anything, give me a call.
Yes, sir.
she didn't tell you anything.
this might come as a surprise, but people aren't always honest.
not much we can do about it without a little leverage. You know she's wesen?
you clock that? - No.
I saw her woge, or whatever you call it, when her friend was warning her about you guys.
we need more than that to bring her in.
Hey, that body was found with designer clothing, right?
Yeah.
how's a girl from a place like this gonna afford gear like that?
you come from nothing, you can't help but brag to someone.
she's lying!
what the hell is she doing?
Hey. - What the...
what did Cammy tell you?
you're a...
you were gonna say "Grimm," right?
don't kill me. You know Cammy?
I know she's dead, and I know she had something lined up after this.
what was it?
I don't know. - What was it?
she... she met a woman named Donna.
free rent and good clothes, and she didn't have to hook or anything.
Donna. Okay. Where do I find her?
she met her at O'Bryant Square. Do you think she killed her?
Hey! - You okay?
what the hell do you think you're doing?
O'Bryant Square... It's where Cammy met someone named Donna.
that's who gave her the job. Promised her good clothes and a place to crash.
and I probably would have found out more if you guys hadn't butted in.
Yeah, Wu.
got a hit from robbery. Want it?
anything good? Store downtown got ripped off yesterday.
over 17 grand worth of merchandise.
security footage I. D.'d your vic.
looks like our vic was mixed up in some sort of high-end heist ring.
so she was a shoplifter?
that's not exactly foreign to a kid who's been in the system most of her life.
except someone dressed her up so she'd fit in.
we got a lead on a woman named Donna. Might be picking up girls in O'Bryant Square.
dresses a few street girls up, teaches them how to act.
make anywhere from 20, 000 to 30, 000 a week. Modern-day pygmalion.
any idea why they killed the vic? She almost got caught coming out that last store.
could be she was becoming a liability.
we're gonna coffee and doughnut O'Bryant square tonight, see if we can find out who this Donna is.
we think they might be looking for a replacement.
so how's the ride along going?
Oh, fine.
homicide takes a strong stomach. You see a lot of weird stuff.
not everyone can take it. It's not so bad.
as long as you don't have nightmares.
tell me about it.
good luck.
this better be it.
what?
Oh, come on!
open, damn it!
I never knew being a cop was so boring.
Oh, you're not bored? Part of the job.
Hey, what about her?
clothes aren't cheap, and she looks like she's looking for somebody.
probably having an affair.
maybe they're in love. Maybe.
what do you think?
she's probably having an affair too.
no, that's gotta be her.
well, even if it is, we have to wait for her to make a move.
what if she doesn't? Then maybe it's not her.
Hey, got any change? - What?
change, you know, like quarters, dimes.
Trubel! - I'm hungry.
you got some change? No, sorry.
change?
what is she up to now? - Mm.
sorry, no. Any change?
you got any change?
Oh, crap. - Hold on.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. If it's her, you're gonna blow it.
let's just see what she does.
anything. I'm just... I'm looking for something to eat.
why don't you go home?
if I had one, I would.
like my shoes? - Yeah.
would you like a pair of shoes like these yourself?
I can't eat shoes. You work, or you just like to beg?
I don't like doing this.
well, maybe you'd like to do something for me.
maybe.
some things nobody can make me do. No hooking.
just shopping.
what kind of shopping?
come with me.
damn, I think Trubel's got her.
we gotta stop this now.
I don't see her!
there.
she's getting into a car. Get the plates!
55 Romeo Sierra... Damn! That's all I could get.
I need a BOLO on a gray BMW x6. Partial plate 5 5 Romeo Sierra.
she's a smart girl. She survived on her own for a long time before now.
I was supposed to protect her. I brought her into this.
and you'll get her out. We just have to stay focused.
bolo will come up with something.
so when you say shop, you mean, like, without paying.
that's what we're talking about here, right?
you got a problem with that? - Not unless I get caught.
who said you got the job yet? You still gotta meet Ken.
who's Ken?
Ken takes care of us.
welcome.
Donna, you did well.
she is beautiful.
maybe a little rough around the edges.
we'll manage.
what's your name?
it's pretty.
come in and make yourself at home. This is Vanessa and Jenny.
come on, girls. Say hi.
Donna's told you a little bit about what we do here?
let's see how you clean up.
tell me you got something. - Ran the partial.
one BMW with "55rs" registered to a Donna O'Hara.
got a record for fencing stolen property.
vehicle address is 24 southwest stark, apartment 320.
you want me to send some units down there? No, let us check it out first.
so what's the deal with Ken?
well, what kind of cut do you guys get?
that good, huh? Don't let him hear you talk like that.
Why? You don't know a thing about him.
the girls that do this just end up...
Jenny, you're scaring her.
you think you can walk in these? No.
well, try.
perfect fit.
there's no one home. - Yeah, well, we're going in.
Nick, we need a reason.
somebody's yelling "help.
that girl's rubbing off on you.
still have the tags on 'em. - She's not here.
what are we looking for?
I don't know, but we gotta find something.
damn, girl, you are hot. Not let's see if you can sell it.
walk for me a little.
don't worry, I'll teach her.
just gonna take a little practice.
do you have any family?
not anymore.
let me see you smile.
a good smile can be your best weapon.
she's gonna be great.
same type of garment bag the victim was buried in.
looks like they've been casing stores from here to Seattle.
she was paying bills.
electricity, gas, cable. She's got a bank account.
maybe we can get access. Hold on.
what? - There's two gas bills.
one's for this address, one's for another.
northwest industrial. Worth a look.
wish I had stuff like this. Put the clothes back on the rack, please.
tomorrow we'll see what you can do.
okay. Just gotta get my stuff.
you staying someplace?
no, I-I stashed it.
I gotta get it before somebody else does.
whatever things you've got, you don't need anymore.
Oh, I won't be gone very long. You won't be gone at all.
what, I can't leave?
why would you ever want to?
you're part of the family now.
new girls spend their first night with me.
you shouldn't have done that.
what the hell?
get out! Get out! Get out!
I'll kill you, you bitch! - What happened?
you don't know what he'll do.
I do! Get out! Now!
you brought me a Grimm!
a Grimm? - How do you...
Oh, crap.
that's the car we're looking for. This is it.
there's a light on upstairs. It's locked.
I'm getting the car.
it's all right now. It's okay.
we gotta get you out of here.
open, damn it!
she's gonna get herself killed.
there's a learning curve to being a Grimm, remember?
well, most learning curves don't draw blood.
maybe she'll choose a different life. She'll always see them.
there's no running from that.
I screwed up, didn't I?
well, you found the girls, so...
Hey, it's okay. I messed up, I know it.
I'm just not used to being the hunter.
and I guess I got carried away.
I need to know more.
I hope you're still willing to help me.
why don't we talk about it in the morning?
okay.
you look like you could use some sleep, so...
you kind of do.
who used wild brush strokes and bold colors
much like a man trying to pick up a woman.
here i was, trying to be abstract,
but i guess i wound up being pretty simple.
all successful creative endeavors are simple.
so i must have a chance.
I--I really can't stay.
Oh, i hope the print didn't put you in the wrong mood.
no...it's not you. I'm sorry.
look, i think you just need to relax a little bit.
you don't understand.
no, you don't understand.
you know exactly why you came here.
okay, baby.
not in the sense that i can see anything.
Oh, my gosh. It should be working. I don't get it.
can you please just let me try? - No, no, no, no, no.
all right, how about now?
are you using input or output?
what was that? - We just got egged.
stay here. - No, i'm coming too.
no, not unless you have a gun, and you don't.
one gun in the house is enough, thank you.
what the hell are you doing?
it's just kids.
Oh, god! Run! - Run!
Yeah, well, they egged our window.
they can't--No, come on. They're probably scared to death.
Yeah, maybe this is a little overkill.
you think?
come on, let's go.
I used to do crap like that all the time when i was little.
I mean, you're kids.
you dare each other to do stupid stuff.
there was this really, really old guy Who lived on our block, and we all thought That he looked like a troll.
so we'd always dare each other to run across his backyard,
which seemed really scary.
well, my dad said that he was a war hero
who'd been really badly injured in one of the wars.
that's why he looked the way he did.
wait, so you're telling me you think these kids Think i'm a monster?
no. Don't be ridiculous.
no, i guess we haven't.
maybe that's something we could work on.
two eisbiber kids egged my house last night.
you're the monster under the bed.
I think some wesen found out you're a grimm - And they're curious. - What's a wesen?
you know, blutbaden, fuchsbau, wildschwein, those of us The grimms have been trying to eradicate for centuries.
Yeah, but you know i'm not like that.
dude, join the misunderstood.
try telling people i don't eat meat.
it's like i told you when we first met.
none of us have ever seen a grimm before, you know?
you're not real, you're a scary story we tell our kids.
be good or a grimm will come cut your head off.
okay, so now i'm on some kind of grimm grapevine.
you're big news in the wesen world.
look, it's not them who i'm worried about.
it's who they're gonna tell and who they're gonna tell.
you gotta deal with that before it gets any worse.
how's it going with juliette? You tell her anything yet?
Ah! Not quite.
nada? Zip?
Diddly? - Yeah.
I guess grimms aren't that brave after all.
no, no. I got it.
death calls. - Shh.
Yeah, what do you got? - Have a nice day.
where? Victim's ryan showalter, 28.
stock analyst with mindel, brandt, and zoic.
neighbors hear anything? Any witnesses?
no, haven't found anybody yet. We're still canvassing.
it's a pretty quiet building. - Surveillance cams?
lobby and parking garage. We're downloading it now.
who found the body?
girlfriend, amy lewis. She's an actress.
she lives here, she had in audition in l. A.
she got back around 9: 00 a. M. And found him.
that's her over there. She's pretty shook up.
I would be too. - We sure that's him?
girlfriend i. D.'D him. Says he's missing his gold rolex.
she's certain he'd have been wearing it.
said it's registered with the insurance company.
the body's completely desiccated.
that doesn't happen overnight. - When was the last time anybody saw him alive?
try last night. According to his girlfriend,
showalter was among the living at an art gallery opening At 8: 00 p. M.
she spoke to him on his cell phone last night.
no way this guy was alive last night. - Hey, i found something.
looks like it was bitten off. - Yeah, nail polish.
must be a woman's finger, but you never know.
at least we'll get a clean print.
what? - It moved!
must have been a nerve.
you want to pick it up again Or you want me to give you the finger?
that's ryan.
could be that's the phone call with the girlfriend.
how well did you know ryan?
he bought a few pieces from me, but i can't say That i really know him.
wait, who's the woman? - I've not seen her before.
I remember the hat, but i've never seen her before.
I thought this was invitation-Only.
Yes, but we work from a list that a number Of other galleries work from.
I can't say that i know everyone on it personally.
we're gonna need that list. - Of course.
she's leaving. - He's leaving too.
could be he caught up with her on the street.
maybe they had plans to meet up later.
and he didn't want to be seen leaving with her.
or she didn't want to be seen leaving with him.
so who was seducing who?
my experience...
the woman runs the relationship.
well, you two seem to get all the interesting cases lately.
not that i'm complaining. Love the challenge.
well, i can tell you the cause of death.
your victim was made to ingest something highly corrosive.
some kind of acid. What kind? I don't know...yet.
but the mouth, esophagus, and stomach lining Were all eaten away.
whatever it was completely liquefied his organs,
which were then sucked out through this jagged incision Here, in his abdomen.
and what could do that, some kind of embalming pump?
well, those are usually used to pump things in, not out,
but i suppose you could switch it around.
would that explain his overnight mummification?
Oh, it might.
now, what about the incision in his abdomen? Was that a knife?
more like teeth.
it looks something like a bite mark.
literally sucking the victim dry.
are we looking at a revenge killing?
don't know yet. Victim's never been married, - So we ruled out ex-Wives. - Current girlfriend's alibi checks out.
could be an ex. He was a bit of a player.
and the only thing missing was his rolex.
we got the serial number from the insurance company.
put it on a hotlist. - And what about his financials?
not in debt. Doesn't seem to be a gambler, Except maybe the stock market.
well, lots of people lost money on the market,
maybe one of his, uh, female clients Didn't appreciate his stock tips.
anybody look at our pension funds lately?
there's motive for homicide right there.
Hey, we got a hit off that finger.
same print turned up at a crime scene in phoenix Five years ago.
Phoenix p. D. Emailed you guys their files.
tox reports are on your desk. - Thanks.
let's see what we got.
well, this looks familiar.
seems like your killer's been to phoenix.
victim's name was george dixon, 25.
last seen at his bachelor party. No suspects.
the single print is all they found.
only thing taken was his fiance's wedding ring, Worth 10 grand.
could be she's collecting trophies of her kills.
a ring in phoenix, a watch here.
looking at the tox report, the victim was found In a mummified state, just like ours.
you ever hear of latroinsectotoxin?
Yeah, gargle with it every morning.
what is it? - It's an amino acid Found in spider venom.
why can't she just shoot these guys and keep it simple?
some people don't like guns. - Some people don't like spiders either.
well, she's already killed twice. Could be more victims.
see if you can find another match. Let me know.
all right. Why don't you deal with phoenix?
I'll follow the venom.
travelling on a steamer from singapore, "I met a japanese doctor by the name of hasegawa, "Who i was surprised to discover shared my abilities.
he gave me the following scroll, "Which described a recent encounter With a previously unknown creature.
I've had several passages roughly translated.
well, if you can't hold your liquor, you shouldn't be drinking.
what do you want from me? what are you doing here?
I came here to ask you the same thing.
why are you and your buddies watching my house?
I-- - just breathe. come on, breathe!
none of us have ever seen a grimm before.
Where'd you hear about me and where i live?
Hey, doofus! where's the beer?
you.
Oh, my god. oh, my god.
I have three kids.
you're the one who started all this. - no, no. well, yes, sort of.
but i-i didn't mean anything.
it's just that nobody believed me.
I didn't know how else to prove you were a--you have a very lovely wife.
we're not married. - even better!
please...you don't have to kill us.
I'm not gonna kill anyone.
Really? - good. that's good.
unless they threaten me or my girlfriend.
no, no, no. we--we would never do that. never. ever.
how many wesen have you told? - nobody!
w-well, hardly anyone.
you know, maybe just a couple of neighbors. - all right, here's what you're gonna do.
you're gonna make sure that whoever you told and whoever they told never come to my house again.
Oh, fine. sure. we can do that.
we--uh, right? - of course! you bet! absolutely!
well, i hope so...
cause i'd hate to have to come back here.
y-you won't have to do that. - not that you're not always welcome.
anytime. anytime! - good.
so we understand each other.
turn-down service.
housekeeping.
same bite marks.
this is a...piece of dress, maybe.
let's get hotel surveillance, see who we got wearing a black dress.
5'7 " , 120 pounds.
just like our suspect from the art gallery except for the blonde hair.
little black dress.
same as the fabric we found in his hand.
just got off the phone with the chiefs of police in phoenix and albuquerque.
they've linked your fingerprint to two more murders in phoenix five years ago.
victims were found desiccated within a three-day period.
bite marks on each victim.
now, there were also three murders with a similar m. o.
in albuquerque five years before that.
were all thought to be some sort of ritualistic killing.
no suspects were ever charged.
three murders every five years.
only two victims in portland so far.
means the ritual isn't complete.
they're also gonna send over a list of items that the killer took from each victim, mostly jewelry.
watches, rings.
look, we want to get ahead of this thing, we need to figure out how she's picking her victims.
she will kill again.
can i, uh, give the pretty lady a hand?
now, that is a really pathetic line.
does that ever work for you?
never. but i keep trying.
well, today might be your lucky day then.
I actually could use a hand.
you can start with that.
Ah, the heavy lifting first.
Thanks, dad. come on, mom. we're late. we gotta hurry.
good luck.
watch the offsides!
Oh, come on in.
caught me making some baddenwurst.
I was feeling sort of homesick.
my mom used to make this stuff all the time.
you want some? - who's in it?
okay, when my nana used to make it, she stuffed it with, you know, whatever, whoever was around.
Yeah, i think i'll pass. - no, but mine's vegetarian!
no, i'm good. thank you.
so you wanted to talk about spider poison?
actually, i want to talk to you about spider...wesen?
is that right? - yeah.
we don't really consider them part of the phylum.
personally, i'm not a spider fan per se.
I catch one, i wash it down the drain, watch it squirm.
but only if i catch them in the house.
if they're outside, then live and let live, you know?
I found a book, there were some photos in it, but it was mostly written in japanese.
Japanese? that's interesting.
don't expect me to translate it though.
ich sprechen some deutsch, but that's about it.
there's a whole bunch of different kinds of spiders, you know?
some molt, some eat their young, which i consider the height of bad parenting, but as far as we're concerned, they're pretty harmless to us.
well, what about the kind that suck the insides out of their victims?
Oh, that kind of spider.
you know it? - yeah.
I'd say that looks like a spinnetod--a death spider.
there's not many of them, thank god.
they're like the black widows of their world.
I really don't know much about them except they kill after sex, which, to my way of thinking, kind of ruins the evening.
I wish i knew something about their habits.
and do they have any rituals? - i don't know.
have you searched the web, so to speak?
actually, wait a minute.
Charlotte. - seriously?
I might know someone who can help you.
Yeah, if she's still alive.
and when you ran around the outside
and kicked that goal.
I thought i was gonna scream my lungs out.
too bad we lost.
honey, it doesn't matter if you win or lose.
I know, it's how you play the game.
well, i guess we drilled that one in pretty good.
we missed you last night, mom.
I know.
at least i got to see your game.
and...I also got your dad something very nice.
something he's really gonna like.
what is it?
Wow.
this is amazing. thank you, honey.
EW, you guys are gross. i have homework.
take your dishes. - i know.
I like your watch, dad.
this is too nice to wear everyday.
it's for special occasions.
you look fantastic.
???
what is this place?
it's a klosterhaus, a retirementmonastic retreat home for wesen.
you guys have your own rest homes?
Yeah, we're not savages.
except for schneetmachers.
noted.
it's nice to see you again, charlotte.
you're looking...well-ish.
don't bother.
I know what i look like. i'm not blind...yet.
come on in.
this is nick. he's a detective.
and he's something else.
he's a grimm.
but don't worry, he's sort of a modified grimm.
what's he gonna do to me that time hasn't already done?
I'm investigating a string of murders, and i think they involve a spinnetod.
you're helping him?
well, he's sort of new at this, so
I turned my back on who i was years ago, which is why i'm here.
how many victims? - two.
what did they look like? - mummified.
their insides were sort of-- - turned into degueulasse.
gut butter. - in a way, yes.
but you're right. that's a spinnetod.
you're sure she's killed twice? - in portland.
and three in phoenix before that, five years ago.
and three in albuquerque five years before that.
15 years.
three, three, and two.
Yep, that'd be right.
her age would be between 28 and 32, depending on when she first went through le retour d'age.
the transition. the change.
but she'll have to kill again, within three days of the last feeding, to interrupt the mortification process.
mortification process? - sounds like fun, doesn't it?
it's really quite not.
so what happens if she doesn't kill and the mortification process continues?
you're looking at it.
can you guess my age?
I'm 26 years old.
when she told me that, i thought she was a total whack-job.
I mean, i didn't mean it in a bad way.
we're plagued by a condition that causes rapid aging.
the only way to reverse it is to kill and suck the lives out of young men.
you have to understand, this is not something we want to do.
we don't take pleasure from it.
tears out your heart.
but no matter how much the kills torment you, how many tears you cry, there's no stopping it.
the biological imperative is virtually impossible to resist.
was anything else taken from the victims
besides their lives?
Yeah, there was a rolex watch taken from one of the victims.
we're attracted to shiny objects.
I don't know why, but we are.
you're not wearing any.
as you can see, i've chosen a life where i won't give in to temptation.
not that it's always been easy.
you two young men look more tantalizing by the minute.
okay, so, nick, unless you have any more questions.
Nope, i'm good.
thank you, charlotte. it was lovely to see you again.
she's only killed two victims so far, and if charlotte's right, today is the third day of the mortification process.
sounds like she's gonna kill again and soon.
exactly.
Yeah, i'm gonna stay home tonight. play a little cello.
um, hold on, read it to me again.
Yeah, that's it. on our way.
don't bother to sit. we just got a hit on the rolex watch.
where? - washington middle school.
excuse me? - principal just called.
Ben. he's one of our seventh graders.
took it home and showed it to his mother.
she asked him where he got it, and he said he traded it for his mountain bike.
she was very upset, called the school, brought it down here, and as soon as i looked at it, i realized it was a very expensive watch.
I wanted to make sure it wasn't stolen, so i called the police before i did anything else, and here you are.
and, uh, did ben tell you where he got the watch?
another student. sally marcinko.
Hi, i'm nick. your name's sally?
look, you don't have to be scared.
we just want to know where you got the watch.
I-I-I found it.
Sally, you told ben that you took it from your father.
you've got the list. We're looking for rings and jewelry.
you catch a look at the wife?
bandage on her finger.
excuse me.
how'd you hurt your finger?
it's not much of a story, really.
we're still interested.
I was making dinner while helping with homework
while yelling at some telemarketer never to call again
and I mistook my finger for a carrot.
could we see the cut?
you're not squeamish, are you?
not so bad now.
almost healed.
any other body parts you want to see?
I told you where I got the watch.
right, a swap meet.
for $200. A $20, 000 rolex.
the guy selling it thought it was a knockoff.
can you hear yourself, robert?
do you know how dumb that story sounds?
just because you keep repeating it doesn't make it true.
but it is true!
you never thought your little girl would take That watch to school and trade it for a bike, did you?
bet your partner in crime's really pissed at you right now.
I swear to god,
I have absolutely no idea What you guys are talking about.
we're talking about a woman who's killed At least eight people, and that rolex connects you to her.
now, we know it's not your wife.
so tell me, who is she?
I don't know anything about any murders!
then I'm done talking to you.
Rolex gives you possession of stolen property.
you could at least charge him with that.
as far as accessory to murder goes...
you got nothing.
his wife's involved.
I know it.
I should be back by 11: 00.
Sally will be fine, lena. Don't worry.
Hey, tonight's about homework.
you need to remember why you're here, okay?
whatever.
I got nothing on this guy. He's stonewalling and he's good.
we got it. - what?
something you're not gonna believe.
make me a believer.
we got a hit on the wife's print taken from the house.
it's a match to the finger that we found on the floor Of showalter's condo.
what? How's that happen? The wife had all her fingers.
I don't know. I don't know. But look at it. It's an exact match.
we found our killer.
well, you get to explain this to the d. A.
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm gonna let her explain that.
I'm gonna take another crack at the husband.
I know about lena.
I don't know what you're talking-- - she's a spinnetod.
and now you know what I am.
what do you want from me?
I know she's gonna kill again.
then you know I can't stop her.
I don't expect you to.
where is she?
I don't know.
I never have.
spinnetods kill their mates...
so why are you still alive?
I first met lena in high school.
and you can imagine, she was the most beautiful girl in school.
you've seen her, so you know what I mean.
and me? I didn't stand out.
we had this social studies class together.
we looked at each other and we just knew.
talk about chemistry or electricity
or whatever you want to call it, but we had it from day one.
and it's still the same now.
you want to ask me why she lets me live?
it's because there's no life for either of us Without the other.
???
?
Portland p. D! We're coming in!
go, go, go! Move! Move!
Mrs. Marcinko!
you guys go downstairs. We're going up.
got it. Let's move.
clear! Hallway clear!
door to your left.
what do you got?
I don't know.
somebody want to tell me what that is?
it looks like skin.
detectives. Harbor patrol just found the wife's car At river place marina.
called the skip.
he says we can take her out in the morning, If you'd like to, have brunch on the river.
???
?
what-what was that?
it's probably just the wake from the boat.
water scares me a little.
???
I'm a cop. Don't talk, don't move. Come with me.
I'm taking him off.
does my grandma know I'm coming?
Yeah, we talked to her on the phone, she knows.
is my mom okay?
she wasn't hurt.
where is she?
when can I see her?
when can I see my dad?
maybe tomorrow?
the BEAST WAS SILPLY THE CALL OF THE WILD PERSONIFIED...WHICH SOME NATURES HEAR TO THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION
all units, report of a 4-15, disturbance in progress.
pine and Southeast 57th Avenue.
unit 18, copy, en route.
I live here, there's a terrible fight.
please, ma'am, get back in your house!
unit 18, request backup!
police! We're coming in!
this one's gone.
I got a pulse. - 10-71.
1501 Pine in the southeast quadrant,
I'm gonna need an ambulance. I have two down.
something's moving!
police!
stay down! - NO, HOLD ON - You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. - PLEASE, PLEASE
those guys... they're animals! I'm advising you to remain silent.
didn't you see them?
don't move! - What are they?
what the hell are they? They looked like monsters.
listen... no! - Don't move.
no, no, no, listen to me! They wanted to eat me.
don't let 'em get me! No!
they were trying to kill me. They're monsters!
seven YEARS LATER...
they were already out of eclairs.
Thanks, I'll get the next one.
Hank, you already got this one, which I didn't even get you. What?
Oh, sorry.
you okay? Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, I guess" means no.
I ever tell you about this guy I arrested seven years ago, Craig Ferren?
I don't think so. Shot two brothers.
one died... was a local councilman or something.
brothers were unarmed.
Ferren was an Iraq vet, had some issues.
got sentenced to death. Okay. What about it?
well, when I arrested Ferren, he claimed the two brothers turned into some kind of monsters.
tried to attack him. I have a feeling I know where this is going.
the guy's claims were totally outrageous.
there was no evidence to support anything he was saying.
I walked into that house that night, those two brothers looked pretty damn human.
anyway, my testimony helped land Ferren on death row.
and now you have a new perspective as to what Ferren said he saw.
Ferren could be telling the truth, right?
maybe. Yeah, maybe he was just high or drunk.
maybe he was telling a story to justify what he'd done.
or maybe he saw something that can't easily be explained.
there's always that.
look, I need your help on this one. You want confirmation.
well, if it's a Grimm thing or not, wouldn't you?
well, I can't do that without taking a look at the evidence, talking to the defendant... Thanks, Nick.
I was hoping you would say that.
Craig Ferren is scheduled to be executed tomorrow night at 9: 00 P. M.
we've got 361/2 hours.
Ferren not only claimed that he saw The Kreski brothers turn into hideous monsters, he also claimed they were cannibals.
at the time, it all sounded ridiculous.
fangs, claws...
like he was building an insanity plea.
even if what Ferren saw was real, believing him... it's not gonna get him off death row.
we gotta find something concrete, something that... The rest of us could believe.
detective Robert Anderson worked the Ferren case.
what happened to him? Works white collar for the feds now.
I'll give him a call.
Yeah, I'm aware of that. No. No, I haven't forgotten.
I just...
I got pulled away on some business at city hall.
Yeah, I'll be in soon.
Craig Ferren shot two innocent, unarmed men.
all evidence showed the crime was premeditated, and his guilt was undeniable.
Ferren admitted he was the shooter. No, we're not saying Ferren didn't do it.
well, then what the hell are you doing? Some of Ferren's claims may have been justified.
he may have been attacked.
find evidence the Kreski brothers had weapons?
no, that's not it. - Then what?
Craig Ferren accused the Kreski brothers of being cannibals.
we conducted a thorough search of Kreskis' house, found absolutely nothing.
but did you dig up their yard? Check the rest of their property?
we interviewed friends, neighbors, co-workers.
you're talking about two guys who were liked and respected by everyone in their community.
and, no, I did not dig up their damn backyard.
Hank, you're not responsible for this guy being on death row.
he's responsible. Let justice prevail.
don't get me wrong. I like Nick a lot.
but you don't love him.
I don't know if I love him, I just met...
it feels like I just met him. So what's wrong with that?
you know, I wish I could re-meet my husband again.
it's a little bit more complicated than that.
complicated?
there's someone else. No.
no"? Really, no?
like I said, it's complicated.
so what's Mr. Complicated's name?
that's not important.
are you sleeping with him? - No, no.
you're sleeping with Nick. - No!
I'm not sleeping with anybody.
but you have feelings for this other guy.
I don't understand it.
I barely know this other guy, but I can't stop thinking about him, and it's driving me crazy.
detective Burkhardt, Detective Griffin.
is this about Craig?
I was the arresting officer. Can we talk to you for a moment?
I thought you looked familiar.
what do you want? I want to try to help him if I can.
Why? Well, it's hard to explain, but some of the cases we've been working on recently have...
given us kind of a new perspective.
and we want to apply that to Craig's case while there's still time.
we met at Oregon state. I was studying marketing.
Craig wanted to be a mechanical engineer. He dropped out to join the army.
he was very patriotic. Iraq changed him.
he came back with terrible headaches, nightmares.
he could never sleep through the night.
wasn't he being treated for PTSD? You wanna call it that.
he was prescribed a bunch of drugs, which he downed with alcohol, though he'd hardly ever been much of a drinker. We know he was arrested.
DUI, couple of public drunkenness charges, got into a few scuffles.
Craig had his issues, but he wasn't a murderer.
he was just starting to get his life back together when all this happened.
the prosecution, the media...
they called him a "loose Cannon," a "ticking time bomb.
that could not be further from the truth.
it's ironic, isn't it?
that Craig's the one being portrayed as the monster.
so you believe him? I'm not inside Craig's head.
I don't know what he saw, but I believe he saw what he said he did.
it haunted him.
still does.
everyone told him he was crazy, so he started to believe that he was.
he even told me that he didn't want to see me anymore.
I just didn't listen to him.
has anyone else seen these letters?
Yeah. I represented Craig Ferren at his murder trial.
lot of good it did.
I filed every appeal I could, and every one of them was rejected.
unfortunately, he got the legal defense he could afford.
according to the transcripts, you only called one character witness,
Ferren's girlfriend, Monique.
guys, she was the only one that really got along with him.
what about some of his army buddies? Good idea.
so on cross-examination the jury could hear about how well he handled a gun?
what an efficient killer he was? I'm a public defender.
I'm not a miracle worker. I deal with 15 cases a day.
I have no personal life.
can I offer anybody a tissue?
did you investigate any of Ferren's claims?
what, about the Kreski brothers? I looked into them. They were clean.
and if they were cannibals, they must have ate up all the evidence.
did Ferren ever describe to you what they looked like when they were monsters?
Oh, he did better than that.
Ferren drew these. I submitted them to the judge.
when she stopped laughing, she refused to let them be entered into evidence.
his psych evaluation said he knew the difference between right and wrong.
this could just be a wild goose chase.
not a goose, wild or otherwise.
a Wendigo.
wendigo? That doesn't sound German.
it's not. This is from 1759.
after the disappearance "of the magistrate and his wife, "I tracked what I believed to be a Wildermann "through Starksboro into the Camel's Hump forest.
it was there I first heard of the mythical Wendigo "from the chieftain of the algonquin tribe "that had provided me refuge for the night.
I soon learned "that these terrifying beasts are no myth.
I came upon the cave of the Wendigo, "rife with human remains, having been the scene of many murders and cannibalistic acts.
two days later, I encountered "the Wendigo himself.
his eyes seemed to glow.
his breath was hideous "with the horrible stench of burned flesh.
I made the terrible mistake of wounding him, "which only made him more ferocious.
I was lucky to escape with my life, as I surely would have been his next dinner guest.
Dahmer was a Wendigo?
someone in my family thought so.
says they usually dig pits to bury the remains under houses or in basements.
if this is what Ferren saw, then it was self-defense.
I think it's time we talked to Ferren.
look out, y'all.
there's cops.
what do they want?
I don't want to know. - Neither do I.
I got nothing to say to you.
you don't have to talk, but you've got 31 hours left, so what have you got to lose?
you're here to clear your conscience?
this is my partner, Nick Burkhardt.
he specializes in...
unusual cases.
we might be able to help you, if you'll let us.
right.
I want to hear about what happened the night you shot the Kreskis.
read the transcripts.
I have. I want to hear it from you.
it was a mistake. I didn't see anything.
you didn't see this?
we got it from your lawyer.
and the interesting thing is it looks just like this.
it's called a Wendigo.
you're not the only one who's seen them.
what the hell's going on here?
we believe you.
it's a little late for that.
I'm done here.
their breath smelled like burning flesh, right?
you claimed the Kreskis were cannibals.
you see any evidence of that?
no.
then why did you think that?
I was there to fix their sink, right?
do the job, get my money, get out.
they started laughing, like they'd been drinking or something.
I don't know.
then they said, "we'd love to have you for dinner.
they started laughing even harder. I said no.
I just wanted to fix what needed to be fixed.
then one of them said, "no, you don't understand.
we'll be fixing you for dinner.
I thought they were crazy.
then what?
then I got spooked, and I tried to leave.
and that's when...
that's when you saw them change?
it was horrible.
teeth like needles, twisted lips, yellow eyes.
it was a nightmare.
and I fought 'em off the best I could.
somehow, I got my gun out of my toolbox, and I started shooting.
and then I ran.
but nobody's gonna believe you.
we can't prove to the D. A. That Ferren shot two Wendigos.
we need to prove the brothers were killers.
Yeah, which means we need evidence of their kills.
in the book, didn't it say Wendigos bury the remains of their victims where they live?
and the defense never dug up the yard.
Where's the house the Kreskis lived in when Ferren shot 'em?
mill Park.
man, this neighborhood has changed a lot in seven years.
Oh, man.
what?
this is where Kreskis' house used to be.
Hello? - Juliette.
Hi, it's... it's Sean.
listen, the other night...
was a huge mistake.
Yeah. Agreed.
but I think it's a symptom of a much bigger problem that we're both experiencing. Okay.
look, I don't know how it is for you, but for me, it's just getting a lot worse.
so I've been thinking about some possible solutions.
no, the solution is simple.
we never see each other ever again.
Yeah, I'm not so sure that's gonna work.
Yeah, me neither.
there's someone who I think might be able to help us get through this.
how?
I'm not sure yet, but would you be open to trying?
okay.
there's a shop in the pearl. It's on fulton street.
hold on. Yeah.
sir, the district attorney wants a word with you.
okay, I'll call her back as soon as I'm off the phone. Sir.
she's here.
Oh. Right.
well, uh, bring her in.
I have to go. Can I call you back?
Yeah. Okay.
okay.
my guess, living room would've been here.
well, we can get sonar, scan the place.
if the bodies were here, they're probably still here.
Yeah. Gonna need a warrant to dig.
that's not gonna be easy, and we're running out of time.
we need to talk to the Captain.
he's got company. He's about to have more.
sorry, Captain, but this is really important.
detectives Burkhardt and Griffin, you know the district attorney.
Lauren and I were just talking about you.
she's heard about your visit to death row today. I must admit, it's the first I'm hearing of it.
that's why we're here, sir. You're causing quite a stir.
we just want to make sure no stone is left unturned.
you're the arresting officer.
your testimony helped put Ferren on death row.
you better have a damn good reason for digging into this at the 11th hour.
well, what is it?
you find some compelling piece of new evidence?
or is it that you don't want this man's death on your conscience?
Oh, this isn't about me.
we feel there might be some credence to some of Ferren's claims.
what, are you saying he didn't do it?
no, Ferren killed Miles Kreski and injured his brother. That's not in doubt, but...
then this case is closed. End of discussion.
hopefully, this will be the last I hear of it.
Ferren's going to die tomorrow night.
what's she scared of? That this might screw up her campaign for mayor?
nobody wants voters to think that they made a mistake before an election.
but let me just add, you didn't really give her a compelling reason for what you're doing.
and you really believe this man is innocent?
we think it's worth checking a few details. Before he's put to death.
I won't stand in your way. But this is gonna get an enormous amount of attention.
and trust me, if you're wrong, this is not the kind of attention you want.
nobody's gonna give us a court order to jackhammer up the floor of that market looking for bodies when we don't have any evidence that they're there. All right, look. There's no reason for both of us to stick our necks out on this.
Yeah, and how are you gonna do this without me?
I don't know. - Neither do it.
and I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
you didn't. My family did.
well, as long as you got somebody else to blame, let's do this.
you know, if we can't find bodies buried under the house the Kreski brothers lived in, maybe we need to find where they lived before that.
or after.
Johnny Kreski survived the attack.
if we find him, maybe you could push him a little?
get him to... Woge?
that would at least prove he's what Ferren said he saw.
won't stop the execution.
Yeah. That'd be great.
we know the truth, and there's nothing we can do about it.
I might be able to persuade him.
might look like we forced a confession out of him.
Yeah.
what if Kreski's still doing what he did when his brother was alive?
burying bodies where he lives?
if we find a body or two, it might prove he's not the innocent victim everybody thought he was.
then we need a place to dig. Let's find out where he lives.
I'll do database, you take DMV.
no arrests, no priors, one speeding ticket last year, paid.
one Fender bender.
all here in Portland. Looks like he's still around. I got an address and a license.
1501 Pine, mill park.
now home of your local grab-n'- go convenience market.
I guess he hasn't updated his license address since he moved. Here's something.
looks like there was a bench warrant out on Kreski.
skipped out on jury duty.
summonses were sent to three different addresses, all P. O. Boxes.
none of them recent. So what aren't we doing?
sleeping. So where the hell is he now?
10 SIGNS OF OBSESSION
what are you still doing up?
I couldn't sleep.
Oh, 'cause of me?
no.
what do you remember from the night in the hospital when I woke up?
well, mostly I remember that you didn't remember me.
I was just so excited you were awake.
what do you remember?
just a lot of strange dreams.
like what?
like something being taken away from me.
well, I guess that would've been me. How does that happen?
how does one specific part of your memory just vanish? I think it was the cat scratch.
Nick, I've had a million cat scratches, never lost my memory before.
well, this was different.
what do you mean?
do you remember anything about the night you went into the coma?
I was at Monroe's. That's all.
you don't remember why I took you there, what he said to you? No.
do you remember anything that happened before that?
Yeah, I was standing in the rain and crying, but I don't know why.
why, were you with me? Yes.
do you know why I was crying?
Yes.
you want to tell me?
Juliette, I want to tell you, but you wouldn't understand.
Nick, please.
help me understand.
Juliette, if I told you now, it wouldn't make any sense to you.
fine. Whatever.
I'm glad you know what's best for me.
I finally got the report from missing persons.
each zip code Kreski lived in reported slightly more than normal missing persons during the time he lived there.
same goes for his time in the house where Craig Ferren shot him.
I got the address on Kreski's car registration.
P. O. Box in forest grove.
I also pulled his tax returns from last year.
last job he had was at Willamette builders supply in forest grove.
looks like we start at willamette builders supply in forest grove.
we've got seven hours.
that's John.
Yeah, he looks a bit older now, but, yeah, he works here. Assistant manager.
is he in some kind of trouble? We'd like to talk to him.
I think he's doing inventory in the back.
follow me.
Hey, John.
couple of Detectives here to see you.
detective Burkhardt, Detective Griffin, Portland police.
if it's about Craig Ferren, I got nothing to say.
well, there's a possibility the case might be reopened.
a little late for that, isn't it?
we have to ask you a few questions about what happened that night.
you can ask, I'm not gonna answer 'cause I did all my answering seven years ago, so I'm gonna go back to work. And you guys can have a nice day.
Craig Ferren found out about you and your brother.
now he couldn't explain it, but I can.
I don't know what you're talking about.
you like the taste of human flesh, Johnny?
what?
Ferren drew this.
pretty good likeness of a Wendigo, wouldn't you say?
now, what do you think?
is this you, or is it your brother?
my brother's dead. Get out of my face.
Oh, what's the matter? You got something to hide?
bodies maybe?
leftovers from last night's dinner guest?
Ferren is the monster!
he killed my brother, tried to kill me.
and he's gonna die for it.
you go to hell.
so? He's a Wendigo.
Ferren was telling the truth.
I wish that was enough to arrest him, but we need to find some bodies.
we're gonna find out where he lives, and the manager should know.
Rosalee's... Monroe, it's me.
Rosalee, how's it going? My aunt's getting better.
I think another week or two, and I can get out of here.
I just wanted to see how things were going with you.
Hey, I got a customer. Okay, I'll call you later.
Bye. - Bye.
you said you could help me? - True.
but as I told you before, I need to see both of you.
I'm bringing her in tomorrow. Now I need to make sure we have complete privacy.
what, you want me to close the shop? I'll pay whatever it costs.
now how long is this gonna take?
uh, well, um... I have to assess the situation, and I'm guessing maybe half an hour for that.
and then based on what I find out and also based on my consultations with my, you know, professional colleagues,
I can hopefully formulate some kind of a treatment.
how long is that gonna take? I won't know until I talk to the two of you.
sorry, I can't be more specific than that.
this is a very complicated issue.
these compulsive romantic entanglements can be highly combustible, bordering on the, like, nuclear. Yeah.
which is why I'm sure you'll be here tomorrow.
about what time would you like to do this?
I
I'll call you when I know the exact time.
I'll do my very best to get you...
De-obsessified.
so what are we doing here? - Search the house.
do we have probable cause? - Hell, yeah.
there's a warrant out on him. He skipped jury duty.
works for me.
let's check the floors.
maybe there's some loose boards, a concealed door, something.
floor's all linoleum in here.
Hey, Nick.
scratches on the floor.
that refrigerator's been moved a lot.
strange place to put access to a crawl space.
Yeah, unless he didn't want someone to find it.
after you.
sorry, Craig. I'm afraid it's time.
stand up, turn around, face the wall.
Hey, Nick, check this out.
all right. Help me move this.
well, that should be enough to stop the execution.
let's get forensics down here and call the D. A.
you get him? I wounded him.
it's not good, is it? No.
tonight's execution of Craig Ferren demonstrated two things to this community...
that justice has been accomplished for the family of Miles Kreski and the people of the state and that the office of the district attorney remains as tough on crime...
I think we should change "office of the district attorney" to "my" office.
personalize it. I like it.
blood trail leads out. I'm going after him.
no, you gotta call this in. - Nick.
if you want to save Ferren's life, this can't wait.
Nick, this is my deal. I pulled you in on this.
I'm going after him. You call the D. A.
dispatch. - Yeah, this is Burkhardt.
I need you to patch me through to the district attorney.
sorry, Detective, I think they're gone for the day.
no, this is urgent. It cannot wait.
I'll ring the office.
what? - This is Detective Burkhardt.
you need to stop this execution. On what grounds?
we tracked down John Kreski in forest grove.
he's a killer. Ferren was telling the truth.
do you have Kreski in custody? - Not yet.
look, if Ferren dies, you're gonna have to explain why you didn't do anything.
you really want to take that chance? What do you got?
bodies buried underneath the house, and if we're right, we're gonna find more bodies buried underneath the house the Kreskis lived in when Ferren shot them.
there's no house there now. It's a market.
if you don't call the governor and stop this thing right now, I will.
you're a Grimm? - It took you long enough.
stay down!
killed that monster in self-defense just like Craig Ferren.
you get the D. A.? Yeah.
What'd she say?
I don't know.
Kreski interrupted the call. There's no time left.
warden Stocker.
I understand.
the governor has issued a 12-hour stay of execution.
what a mess. Get me out of here.
how many people did these guys kill?
enough to get Ferren a retrial. Just in the Nick of time.
clean up, aisle four.
there were at least eight victims.
could be more, they're still sifting through it all.
we're going to present our findings to the press in about half an hour.
so how you want to handle this?
I think it's your call.
well, you did call the governor.
and we're not running for mayor.
just a few hours ago,
Craig Wendell Ferren was to have been put to death.
based on new evidence discovered by the tireless efforts of two Detectives in our Portland police bureau, that execution has been stayed pending a reopening of the case.
as district attorney, I have always fought for justice and will continue to do so as mayor.
II don't know what to say.
I don't know why you believed me when no one else would.
I believe there are things we don't understand in this world.
that doesn't mean they don't exist.
did you see what I saw?
it doesn't matter.
but whatever happens, you need to know one thing.
you are not crazy.
but you did see him.
well, that's a long story.
be right with you.
I don't know about this.
Juliette, please.
we have to try.
sorry.
Oh, boy.
Yeah, never seen him before.
all right, y'all, settle down.
listen up and pay attention.
my respect has been taken from me.
who authorized the Colombian hit?
all right.
without getting too biblical and shit, violence only begets more violence.
it does not beget more money...
which is the reason I thought we were all here in the first fucking place.
now, I'm going away for a short period of time...
to pay a political debt to our illustrious police department.
and while I'm away, I don't want no fucking drama...
on our streets...
about anything...
by anyone that's going to draw heat...
or attention to us in any way...
unless you have my fucking permission.
is there any nigga here in Pelham Hall...
that is unclear about what the fuck I just said?
good.
so now, for all you hearing-impaired motherfuckers...
while Levar's down...
I'm number one.
so now, if you have any problems...
come see me.
Marcus. Come here.
well, then...
my brothers.
now, next time you have a problem, you come see me.
see, now you gonna have to take the fall for this bullshit.
cops, man, they planted that shit. - No, they didn't.
we know who's doing what.
see, now be careful who you let in your house.
cause someone close to you is using.
soap up.
being real cheap on the soap.
and y'all can turn the water up a little bit in here.
yo, man! Guard!
fight! We got a fight over here!
you saved my life.
let's go.
Hmm-hmm.
this way. Keep going.
Why?
I don't know. Looked like you needed saving.
what's your name?
Marcus.
Bama. Nice to meet you.
Bama. You from Alabama? - No, North Carolina.
north Carolina? So why they call you Bama?
I didn't want folks calling me Lina.
somebody wanted me to kill myself.
thought about it.
thought about my mother.
I was in a tomb, just like her...
and I had to find a way out.
I went forward...
made my mark.
it was either express myself or die.
I know I did a lot of bad things in my life...
but from that moment on...
I decided to tell the truth.
and I wasn't gonna back down.
Levar was not expecting things to change.
deal with it, okay?
but after the shooting, he wasn't gonna pay a little political debt.
he was gonna pay with his life.
majestic set him up...
and blamed it all on Odell.
this nigga been working for the Colombians.
betrayed Levar. Cost us money.
now, how he gonna pay?
let's pay him in diamonds and gold.
you right, motherfucker. Them shiny-ass motherfucking teeth.
I can't trust you?
are you working with the Colombians?
nigga, you the one set up Levar, nigga!
that was you who set up Levar, nigga!
come on, man! That was you that set up Levar!
Oh, shit.
everybody relax. We're all friends here.
Levar fucked your bitch!
you got a lot of mouth on you, Odell.
Levar fucked your bitch, nigga!
Yeah, babe? - Levar fucked Katrina.
majestic began his rise to the top...
and Dangerous crowned it all with a song.
people got shot.
people disappeared.
and Majestic felt like nobody could touch him.
Yeah, turn my music up.
turn it up in my headphones a little bit, son.
Yeah, we're gonna have to see.
what up? Yo, Majestic! You! What up, baby?
Yeah. Yeah. It's like this. Come on.
niggas that pull their heat and get shook, die on the streets
you can't look weak Niggas'll lay you down six feet
and when you lay down you keep an eye open when you sleep
we took the food out your belly, nigga how you gonna eat?
you want me you can find me on the block
see you in the morning.
and I will squeeze off rounds and watch them slugs split your hairpiece
we run these streets where murderers and gangstas meet
black skull, nigga
we pull the ice and gold straight out your teeth up in the NYC
now you listen, gangster. Listen.
Where's Majestic? - No, man, no, man!
tell Majestic we called.
you know, I ain't never trusted folks.
see, where I grew up...
there was a whole bunch...
of jealous cats.
they used to be mad 'cause I was light-skinned, you know?
they used to grab me after school when I was in first grade and be like:
smack him and watch him turn red.
so I got me a screwdriver and started carrying that with me to school.
they ain't smack me no more.
what's wrong with you, man? - I just wanna kill somebody.
who? - Anybody.
there's a whole lot of anybodies in the world, man.
you know, I had this image in my head...
of Rick James killing my mama.
I mean that. I know Rick James ain't kill my mama.
he just favored this dude named Slim, you know.
well, what you got in your head now?
all kinds of images.
it usually goes down over money and whores
but lil' homie, in my hood when it rains it pours
this is real
lil' homie, when it rains it pours
hollow-tips and Talons when it rains it pours
you caught in lead showers just because
niggas ain't playin' when it rains it pours
the Colombians hit back at Majestic by cutting off his supply of drugs.
eventually, just like Levar...
majestic had to go shake hands with Delgato.
but neither were happy about it.
one shot, one kill, what's the deal? Yo, what's the deal?
listen, lil' homie when it rains it pours
hollow-tips and Talons when it rains it pours
you caught in lead showers just because
niggas ain't playin' when it rains it pours
niggas get set up 'cause when it rains it pours
end up wet up 'cause when it rains it pours
what's up?
you need a manager. - A manager?
in my hood, when it rains it pours
ain't nothin' changed Niggas doin' the same old shit
them new hollow-tips and them same old clips
these folks feeling you, man.
come on, let me get in my house. - Let me be your manager.
man, let me in my house. Stop playing and shit.
I'm telling you, this shit hot, man.
you're looking good.
thank you. I did it for you.
did you miss me? - Yeah, I missed you.
yeah?
how about you? How you doing?
I'm cool. Been staying to myself.
you know. I ain't been doing much talking.
you always have so much to say in your music.
how come you're quiet now?
it's a different part of the brain.
the part you never let anyone see?
I let you see.
do you love me? - You know I love you.
are you still in love with me, though? - Yes.
I'm pregnant.
you sure? - Yeah.
you gonna keep it?
do you want me to?
Yeah.
but, you know, I was just thinking, what about your career?
I just know you love dancing. You won't be able to dance.
I could always dance for you.
yo, Marcus! I'm out, man. - You out?
Yeah. If you ever in Cleveland, you look me up, all right?
take care, man.
turns out I didn't have to go to Cleveland to meet with Bama.
yo!
my nigga out?
what's up, man? - What's up?
I want you to be my number two, man.
I'm out the game, man.
what out? - I'm out.
you out of your mind, you know that? - I'm gonna rap.
justice, tell your boy, man. He talking about he wants to be a rapper.
a rapper?
Yeah, I was writing music while I was in there.
Bama.
so, they let the big old black buzzard out, huh?
Yeah.
they don't know what they did. Shake up the world.
who this nigga? - He's my manager.
first of all, I ain't nobody's nigga. I'm his manager, okay?
Marcus. - Chill, relax, yo.
get in the car, man. - Shut the fuck up, nigga.
who the fuck you talking to? - Just relax, man.
you don't know me. - Relax.
you all right, man? - Yeah, it's cool.
I see you got that little Napoleon thing going on.
I'm gonna be in the car if you need me for anything.
you all right? - Yeah.
I just wanna, you know, just do my thing.
you know, when you get out that chair...
Junebug gonna sit in it.
you know that, don't you?
I need to watch my back?
you know, you're like family to me, yo.
what's up?

I don't know who cut you I don't know who robbed you
but you think I know 'Cause you know how my squad do
nowadays niggas snitchin' so much in the street

I ain't signin' that motherfucking contract
I ain't a bitch like you I ain't going out like that

I can't do that. - I ain't talking about crack.

and that's when I made the biggest mistake of my life.
I'm telling you, Colombians are like clockwork, right?

I told him I was only trying to protect her.
it was far more than that.
your mama didn't want to take my family life from me...
but she gave me everything...
and I took it all.
in the end, I didn't protect her.
sometimes...
I feel like I killed her myself.

I couldn't even look you in the eye.
what you saying?
one night, after midnight...
I was sitting here. Word came through that you was gone.
you was dead.
for the first time in my fucking life, I fell to my knees...
and I prayed to God that nothing happened.
so I prayed to your mama.
I asked her to forgive me...
and to talk to God for me to bring you back.
I don't deserve you.

Yes.
what? I'm fine with it.
so, you met him? - Nope. I pulled his credit report.
you didn't. - I sure as hell did.
Fred, this young brother is a stockbroker for J. P. Oliver.
Theresa? I don't believe it. - Marilyn said she's crazy about him.
and this boy's credit report, I'm telling you, is a thing of beauty.
I almost cried.
wow, this guy sounds too good to be true.
he probably is. But the brother has a job.
I'm glad you think that way... - That's right, my friend. A J-O-B!
...but I quit.
I quit! - Simon, calm down.
I'm just trying to explain to you how the world works.
it's the clients, I'm just explaining...
none of my clients seem to care. This guy didn't seem to care, did he?
come on. Don't be so sensitive.
that's not how the world works. It's how your world works.
Simon, sit down. Simon!
jerk.
I don't need you, Nathan!
I don't need J. P. Oliver.
my resume is good enough. I can get a job anywhere I want. I'm out of here.
I'm not going to freak out!
what am I going to tell Theresa?
what am I going to tell her?
baby, you know how you're always saying I'm at the office too much?
well, great news!
I'll meet my future father-in-law and tell him I'm unemployed. That'll be great.
okay. I'll get the next one.
I can't quit my job!
I'm not gonna beg for this job!
I got $20 says he goes up again. - I'll take some of that.
Oh, my God! I just quit my job!
I don't need this job! No.
here he comes.
Hi. - Have a good one.
Hello, Liz. Simon Green here.
Simon! What's up?
every investment I've made in the last six months.
listen. That job you offered me. Tell me it's still open.
Why? What happened?
I'll tell you about it later. Can you talk to Bartlett for me?
are you kidding? I'm e-mailing him right now.
when he finds out you asked about this...
he will go nuts!
Liz, thank you.
Theresa? Baby?
you're home early.
really early. Hi.
got out of there quick. - Good. Then come on, help me with these.
what have we got?
Tumi.
that's nice. When did we get this? - Got them today.
combined incomes. Bling bling, baby!
Yeah. Bling bling.
baby?
God. You should have heard Dad's voice on the phone...
when I told him you work for J. P. Oliver.
I feel like he's more in love with you than I am.
Really? - Yeah. You don't understand.
ever since I can remember, his whole thing has been about:
Theresa, does that boy have a job?
it's a good thing I do then, huh? - I know.
I'm so excited! Aren't you excited?
Theresa, a man is never excited about meeting his future father-in-law.
you know, I was thinking. Maybe we should postpone telling them.
what?
it was your idea. - I know.
but I'm thinking now that maybe it was a bad idea.
no, I think it's a great idea.
announcing our engagement at my parents' party is gonna be the best present we can give them.
babe, Mom's gonna flip.

swags of tulle with festoons.
sprays of roses.
parquet dance floor here.
guests will be seated at tables in Chiavari chairs.

and rose petals on the lawn. And not just a few...
oodles.

at that wedding, was a woman involved?
of course it involved a woman.
if she's not a woman, it's gonna be a surprise to both of us. Hello!
look. - I'll tell you, this is going to be some party.
twenty-five years of marriage.
more power to you, pal. - Thank you.
Hey, baby. - Sorry I'm late.

I swear half of them ate pure sugar for breakfast.
Hi, Dante.
so, Percy, which one do you like best? - I like that...
is your name Percy?
which one costs the most?
they cost the same. - They don't cost the same.
this one's from Saks. This one's from Macy's.
Saks!
thank you. And now I can give my honest opinion.
I'm digging that one, baby. - Really?
well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm wearing this one.
Hallelujah.
sweetheart.
yeah? - Listen.
why do you even bother asking me?
cause it's a big day for us and I wanted you to feel included.
why couldn't you include Martha Superfreak out there?
Dante is a nice man.
a nice man.
a nice man that part of the time likes to sleep with other nice men.
will you stop it?
would you open your mind, Percy Jones? Dante is a metrosexual.
a what? - He's a straight man with taste.
no such thing. You might as well tell me he rode over here on a unicorn.
look, serious face, serious moment.
I need to talk to you.
I know, baby. I'm working on my vows. Almost got them perfect.
that's sweet, but that's not it. - What is it?
this boy that Theresa's bringing home?
I don't know who his people are, where he's from...
I don't know anything about him.
but what I do know is that I need you to be nice.
I'm always nice.
let's be nice long enough to find out who the boy is.
I already know who he is.
you pulled his credit report? - I did not.
you pulled his credit report, Percy?
I mean, I glanced at it.
but a credit report don't tell you the character of a man.
but being a loan officer for 22 years...
I can size that boy up in an instant.
and you know I got a knack for it. You know that.
five seconds. That's all I need.
that's all I need.
nobody knows that better than me. - Say what?
I didn't stutter.
I'm not so good with dads, baby.
I'm good with moms. I'm better with moms.
he's a big guy, right?
scary big. He also has these piercing eyes that just burn right into your soul.
don't maintain eye contact for a long period of time. At least today, okay?
babe, I'm kidding. Just relax. It's gonna be fun.
okay?
did you tell them? - What? Tell them what?
babe, don't... The... - What?
did you... I'm... - Cute? Clean-shaven? What?
Pigment-challenged? Did you tell them that I'm white?
you're white?
you're white?
stop the car!
Oh, my God! Look at what you...
Oh, my God.
Simon, I'm so sorry.
it was a joke, sir. I was kidding. - Yeah, sister. You're funny.
Simon, are you okay?
who are you? - Are you serious?
why am I in Jersey?
don't worry. It's gonna be great, okay? - All right.
I'm very sorry. It was a bad joke.
so, did you tell them? - No. I only told them the important things.
that I love you. That you're an amazing man.
that you have a very cute birthmark on your left butt cheek.
you just didn't feel the need to mention it's a Caucasian butt cheek. That was...
Simon, look. I didn't mention it because I don't think it's gonna matter.
it's gonna matter.
we're fine, sir.
dad!
look at this here. Oh, my God. Give your daddy a hug.
how are you?
mom!
Hey, my man. Percy Jones, baby. - Pleasure to meet you.
man, look at this here. I like this, man. Nice, solid, strong grip.
Wow. That's something else.
listen. You doing everything you can to make my daughter happy?
no, Dad, it's... - Hey, sweetheart.
you can take that to the front door for me.
thank you. - No, you see, this...
don't interrupt. I'm giving your friend a once-over here.
sir? Don't stand like a statue. Take it to the front door.
that's that square with the hole. Look inside, you see furniture.
thank you. - Yes, sir.
you doing everything in your power to make her happy?
I'm not sure if I am, but I'd sure like a crack at it.
boy, I ought to drill you, man. I like him. - Okay, all right, listen.
young man, don't worry about it. Relax.
I figure, what, $30? Get yourself some candy or something.
dad, this is Simon.
Simon?
that's her boyfriend's name. - That's right.
well, who are you? - Wesley Thompson. That's my cab.
but if you're still down with me making your girl happy...
I'm good to go.
why don't you just go? - Just...
I wish Theresa would have told me you guys were black.
that would have saved an awkward moment.
kind of like this one. - Yeah.
welcome home, sweetheart. - Thanks, Mom.
baby, let me get that. - I got it.
lemonade.
Damn!
ain't no need, us standing out here. Why don't we go on inside and talk?
come on, we going on inside with a quickness. No use standing out here.
just come on.
that boy's white.
nothing gets past you.
I guess it's those 22 years as a loan officer.
you knew about this. - I didn't know a thing, I promise you.
but I did figure it out after the second "Daddy!
why she just didn't say nothing? Give us a warning, you know?
we taught our girls to see only people, not color.
I know that but... - So, what's the problem?
I guess the problem is she just didn't tell us.
I'm expecting Denzel Washington to come walking through the door...
and I get Whitey McWhiteman instead.
Hi, you guys. - Hi!
I'm just showing Simon the house.
you've a very beautiful home, Mrs. Jones.
why, thank you. You can call me Marilyn. - Will do.
you, too, Mr. Jones.
thank you. You can call me Mr. Jones.
I'm just kidding.
you got me. That was funny.
I'm making lemonade. You want to sit down?
Yes, thank you. Sit down, babe. - Great.
so, Simon, they tell me you work at J. P. Oliver?
Yes, sir.
you like it there? You been there long? - Well, it's a couple of years, I suppose.
you moving up? - There's been some recent movement, yes.
you a hard worker? You work hard? - The hardest.
J. P. Oliver has a huge IPO coming up... - He doesn't want to hear about this.
but he's asking you about your work.
I know, but you go into details... - He likes to be modest. Shut up.
anyway, they made Simon their IPO... Wait, what is it? Point man?
and they're flying him to San Francisco on Monday.
I'm not going to see him for three days.
so, Simon, what do your parents do? - Yeah.
my mother is a realtor. - Mom, let me help you with that.
and she sells mini-blinds and teaches dance.
damn. How many jobs your mama got?
she's a single parent. She's always been a hard worker.
what happened to your father?
he left when I was two and I haven't seen much of him since.
I'm sorry to hear that. - It happens.
you play any sports?
I played some foosball in college.
that's the table with the soccer guys... - I know what foosball is.
stupid joke. - It's not a sport.
dad, stop badgering him.
I'm not badgering him. I'm just taking an interest.
I don't understand why you don't play sports? It don't make sense.
a man who don't play sports isn't a real man, as far as I'm concerned.
I used to run a little. - What? Like track?
I mean, you don't look like a sprinter.
What'd you run? Did you steeplechase? - Dad!
come on, man. What was your race?
cars. - Cars.
NASCAR. - NASCAR!
that was the one.
I had some hopes and some dreams and...
it all ended on a hot August day on a speedway in Charlotte.
it was a crash. Just...
they said I should've been killed.
actually, I got out without a scratch. I figured that was a sign.
NASCAR?
mostly I just worked in the pit.
I mean, I test drove for one of the drivers some, but...
what was his name?
Jay Gordon.
you drove for Jeff Gordon?
we called him Jay or J. G. It was like a pet name.
a pit name, actually.
NASCAR?
I believe I said I don't like to talk about that time in my life.
NASCAR?
what was I supposed to do?
he was staring at me with those piercing eyes.
he was not. - It was like filled with piercing disappointment 'cause I don't play sports?
a man who don't play sports isn't really a man now, is he?
I had to give him something! He's big.
he's like... You said he was big, but he's big-big.
but why did you lie about NASCAR? My father loves NASCAR.
it's NASCAR, baby. That's, like, the whitest sport on the planet.
not anymore, Simon.
there's, like, NASCAR and hockey.
hockey. I should have went with hockey.
don't worry. He'll forget about it. He's like this with everyone.
it always takes him some time to warm up to new people. That's all.
what are we talking about here? - By Sunday, you'll be a part of this family.
I can tell he really likes you.
I don't like him.
and I really don't think the whole racial thing matters to him.
it's not that he's white. - It's not?
is this yours or mine? - That's mine and that's for later.
no. I think it's for now.
if memory serves me right, I think it's mine. - No, Simon.
take it off!
take it off right now. - It's perfect on me.
what are you doing? - Look at it. Red is my color.
always has been. Look at it. My goodness! - Simon, take it off.
but it fits me so perfectly.
look, you're stretching it!
take it off right now. - It's not ruined.
it's nice. You take it off.
I'm not joking. - You want some of this?
stop it, Simon.
take it off. - You take it off.
coming in.
mom!
I'm going to tell her right now. - Go and tell.
what? - He's taking Simon to a hotel!
I'm paying for it. What's the problem?
can I speak to you? - You sure can.
why are you taking him to a hotel?
you didn't see what they were about to do upstairs.
mom, we were just playing. - Well, playtime is over.
Mr. Jones, I'm not a cross-dresser.
just for the record.
a cross-dresser? - No.
what are you... It's lingerie.
you shouldn't even be having any. - I'm a grown woman, Percy!
it is not covering up the grown parts! - What!
why does the young man have to go to a hotel?
don't start with me. This is my house and my rules.
your rules?
this house can't handle no more testosterone.
we cannot exceed the testosterone level.
we gotta keep it like that until the girls get married. Maybe even beyond that.
and I'm not suggesting anyone get married!
why can't he stay in the basement, in your room?
because that's my room! That's my stuff down there.
how selfish. - That doesn't make sense.
it got mold, anyway.
could be black mold. I wouldn't feel comfortable putting him at risk.
do you have any idea how ridiculous that sounds?
no, it's okay.
no, it's not okay! What are you talking about?
look, this is your father's house. We're gonna play it by his rules.
now, he's obviously set a testosterone standard.
and I'm going to abide by that.
you falling for that? I'm going with you. - No, you're not gonna do that.
you don't want me to go with you? - Of course I want you to!
but what?
you need to stay here. - Hello?
you need to stay here.
no. I want to be with you! - We're still here!
are you two gonna be done soon, or maybe we should have a seat?
come on, honey. Let's sit...
you need to help your mom with the party arrangements.
we don't want to stress them out, do we?
no.
all right? - Yes.
all right. We're all set. - I'm glad you all decided. Come on, let's go.
come on, get your stuff. Let's go. - Yeah. All right.
where is he? Girl!
Oh, my God. Are we being audited?
no, Keisha. - What's happening?
this is Simon. This is Theresa's boyfriend. This is Keisha, her little sister.
go.
nice to meet you. - Oh, this... Yes. Nice to meet you, too.
good, you all met. Take it to the car. I'll meet you out there.
dad, Theresa's boyfriend is white. - I know.
I know you know.
I just wanted to see your face when you heard it again.
not now.
don't forget we have dinner reservations. - We'll meet you over there.
she was black as the night
Louie was whiter than white
danger
take a walk on the wild side
and the colored girls go doo do doo do doo
looks like rain.
Nope.
those clouds look pretty threatening. - I live here. I know the weather.
so, Theresa tells me you're in charge of the loan department at the bank.
that must be a rewarding job.
I'm thinking about making a switch to a smaller company.
I just think there's less political garbage.
you think I don't deal with political garbage?
I got political garbage coming out my ass.
if I give a guy a loan, I'm married to him for 30 years.
if I deny him, I have to deal with him in church on Sunday.
I know that feeling. - Don't try to act like our jobs are alike.
good thing it isn't raining.
that's not rain. It's sprinkling.
you might want to turn on the windshield wipers.
I will once it starts raining.
come on, you two, let's go.
I don't want to be late. Keisha! - Coming!
why you always got to knock on my door first?
cause you still live here.
let's go. It's raining. I don't wanna be late.
come on.
okay, tell me what's it like?
what's what like? - Being with a white guy.
come on, Keisha, what's the sex like? - Yeah.
Where's Mom?
she's downstairs, girl. Come on! Bring it.
okay. You know that thing they say about the size? Completely the opposite.
Really? - They're huge.
and not only are their penises big, but they can sing.
when they get excited, they sing up a storm.
they know a million tunes. They're like big iPods.
cut it out. Stop it.
Keisha, seriously, is he nice?
Yeah, and he's cute, too. - I know.
what about Mom and Dad? - Mom is cool with it.
I mean, Dad, he seems, you know, a little on edge, but not more than usual.
isn't he ever?
girls! - Coming!
but can I just say, I love you so much right now because...
Why? -From now on, no matter what I do, if I...
crash Dad's car, or if I... - What's wrong?
...rob a bank...
if I burn this house down... - Keisha.
...I won't be the one who brought home the white boy!
thank you!
mom!
can I help you with your bag, sir? - I'm okay. I got it.
you don't trust a working man with your bag?
no, I just... It's just one bag.
what do you think, he'll rifle through your luggage...
and steal your toothbrush and your fancy conditioner?
no, that's not it at all. - Let me tell you something.
Theresa's grandfather was a bellman for over 60 years and he never stole nothing.
could you get my bag?
what, he's your slave now?
no.
did you want me to take your bag, sir?
I don't know.
next, please. - Okay.
Hi. Reservation for Percy Jones.
and that's Jones with a "J"?
no, Jones with a "P.
I made the reservation last week.
you knew you were gonna kick me out a week ago?
son, I knew I was gonna kick you out 24 years ago when the doctor announced it was a girl.
here you are. - Good.
we gave your room away. - What?
check-in was at 4: 00.
it's Thursday night. I'm quite sure you got another room available.
I'm sorry, we're completely booked and so is everyone else.
there's a Shriners convention in town, actually.
may I help you with anything else, Mr. Pjones?
I guess I'll have to stay at your house, then.
no, there's a crack hotel downtown. You'll be just fine. Come on.
next.
Hi. Welcome to Cranford.
I don't know what your basement's like... - It's damp. You'd hate it.
I don't think dampness is really an issue at this point.
you can't think about anything but getting back in the house with my daughter.
Mr. Jones, I'm in your house. I'll obey your rules.
Yeah, right. You'll obey Mr. Jones now...
but when you're up at 3: 00 in the morning all hot and horny, you'll obey Mr. Johnson.
you heard the lady. There's no available hotel rooms in the whole town.
I'm not gonna do anything. I swear. - Put your stuff in there. Come on.
you know, dinner's in about 10 minutes.
I don't know what Marilyn is like about schedule, but I know Theresa is...
stay out of that storm.
all right. You can stay in my basement.
but you remember one thing. These eyes, they see everything.
now get in the car. Come on, let's go.
ebony, ivory living in perfect harmony
ivory, ebony
so, how long have you two been together?
five months. - Six months.
which one is it?
well, see, Theresa counts from the first day that we met.
and I count from the first...
how's the chicken here? - It's really good.
did I tell you two girls that for the first dance, your father and I are gonna do the tango?
the tango? - You and Dad?
you know what? Your father and I used to dance all the time when we were younger.
sweetheart, I told you we're not doing a tango.
we're already saying our vows. That's enough.
we're doing the tango.
sorry. I forgot to turn it off.
know what? This is an important call. I'm just gonna...
no, you can take your call here. Sit down and take your call.
it's a business call. It's boring stuff.
business is not boring. Simon, sit down and take your call.
sit down.
hello. - Simon?
Yeah, this is Simon. - Sorry I didn't get back to you earlier.
I hope Theresa makes good money as a photographer.
someone started a rumor that you're being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
that is so Nathan to do something like that.
I think it's Nathan, too...
cause this is the last thing he wants to see, is his best employee going to another firm.
you know me.
I'm always up for a new challenge. - Are you listening to me?
you've been blackballed. - Great!
guy, it's not my fault. I'm just telling you what they told me.
I'll call you next week.
did Nathan put you up for another award?
nothing. It's embarrassing.
hello. Can I start you off with some drinks? - Vodka tonic.
celebrating a great phone call.
okay. Bring him his liquor, and bring the rest of us our usual.
they have iced tea and I have my lemonade.
actually, I think I'm gonna have a glass of Pinot Grigio.
and I'll have a Cosmo. - Me, too.
okay. Bring them their alcohol and I'll have my usual lemonade.
someone has to act responsibly around here.
so, Simon, I hear that you're a singer.
what are you, a soprano, an alto, or...
no? Maybe bass?
I don't really sing.
how long can you hold a note?
he can hold a note.
Really? - For a very long time.
sing something for me, baby.
are you okay? Drink some water.
Jerry, Nathan's got my ankles to my earlobes right now. I'm gonna need...
I'm gonna need some cash.
call me back as soon as you get this. I need a favor, okay?
you've got to be kidding me.
let me see your sexy body go...
I knew you'd be down here sooner or later.
did you bring some of that sexy lingerie for me to try?
what is wrong with you, boy? Don't you have your own underwear?
you like my space?
Yeah. It's very homey. Interesting odor.
I told you it had mold.
did you come down here for this? Having a little trouble writing your vows?
that's none of your damn business.
I'm just saying, I could maybe help you come up with something romantic.
don't start thinking that you know more about romance than I do.
with your hand-holding and feeding each other food...
and wiping off each other's faces.
that's bullshit.
being married 25 years, that's real romance.
and believe me, it's a war. Brutal. Exhausting.
sounds like someone just finished their vows.
ready for lights out? - Looks that way.
good night. - Good night.
thank you. - You're welcome.
what are you doing? - Getting ready to go to sleep.
here? You're sleeping here? - Right here.
don't you have a bed upstairs? - Sure do. So does Theresa.
by me sleeping here assures me that she'll get a good night's sleep all alone. Good night.
sorry.
what are you doing under there? - It's just a pillow.
we might need a barrier. - A barrier for what?
I tend to move around a lot in my sleep.
how do you know you move around if you're asleep?
Theresa mentioned once that...
I mentioned it to her...
after someone else told me...
that wasn't Theresa.
okay. We can talk about this, right? Theresa and I have a...
no, you can't talk about it. -...healthy relationship...
stop! - We can't talk about this?
I don't wanna hear you talking about sleeping with my daughter.
you're sleeping with me now. Now, good night!
good morning. - Good morning.
you're up early.
or late, depending on how you look at it.
coffee? - Yes. Bless you.
I don't know how you sleep with that man.
did he get in your space? - A little bit.
did he spoon you?
it was more of a wedge maneuver.
big man likes to cuddle in his sleep.
I just wish he were a little bit more cuddly when he was awake.
you know, when my father first met Percy Jones, he could not stand him.
Really?
but eventually they got along, right?
no.
good morning! - Good morning.
good morning, babe.
I missed you. - I missed you.
did you sleep well? - Yeah.
who's going with me to get some flowers? - I'll go.
me, too, if we go early, because I have to work this afternoon.
good morning!
you're looking awfully chipper this morning.
something about knowing your daughter's not being violated relaxes a man.
I thought you said that mattress hurts your back.
no, not me. I could sleep on that mattress every night.
every single night.
good morning, boss. Got you some coffee.
so, what's the verdict? - What are you talking about?
I'm talking about Theresa's new boyfriend.
what is he, a painter? Poet? Did he ask you to borrow some money?
my daughter's got great taste in men. That new guy, he's really something.
tell me a little bit about the brother. - Oh, man, thank you.
I'll tell you about the brother. He's a big guy. Nice looking.
what's his name? - Jamal.
graduated Howard University. - Howard?
played basketball.
he almost went pro. Till he changed his career to medicine.
there was a big write-up on him in Jet four years ago.
no shit.
parents from Atlanta.
friends with Mrs. King, Dr. Cosby, Rev. Jackson.
come on now.
go down towards the middle. - Go down? Sit up a little bit.
that's it? - Man, yeah.
I'm telling you, Reggie. I'm the luckiest man in Jersey.
my daughter's dating the great black hope.
you got it. - That's it.
hold it right there. - I'm not gonna move.
excuse me? Boss?
Simon Green here to see you.
cut that off, Reggie. Go on, take it out.
come on, Reggie. Get on the ball around the...
I'll be right there.
I'll be right out. Give me... Sign something.
Fred, who is Simon? - A friend of Theresa's, he says.
Oh, shit. He better hope Jamal don't find out.
be right with you, sir. - Great.
Jerry? Hey. - Simon, what's up?
listen. I need you to get me into that nanotech IPO. I want 10 blocks.
that's $50, 000!
did you inherit a boatload or something?
the initial public offering comes out on Tuesday. What do you expect me to do?
I know when it comes out. I set the damn date, okay?
just buy it for me on margin.
dude, you don't work here anymore.
I need this IPO to hold me over until I get another job.
I know you're really screwed right now...
but do you even have $50, 000?
I'm gonna sell off my IRAs, okay? I'll have it in 10 days.
I can't do margin.
I need cash.
I'm in Jersey right now. Where am I gonna get cash?
I'm sure one of those chemical plants has an ATM machine.
all right, look. I'll get the cash. Just put in the order.
cash by Tuesday.
I'll bring it to you personally on Monday.
don't punk out on me.
Hey. - Hey.
what are you doing here?
I feel like we didn't get off on the right foot yesterday...
so I thought maybe...
I'd come here and take you to lunch. Maybe we could bond a little.
I think we bonded just fine around 3: 10 this morning when your knee was in my crotch.
right.
I'll buy.
you want to buy me lunch? - Yeah.
I figured it's the proper thing to do after sleeping with each other.
okay.
so, nice bank. - I'm glad you like it.
I like the small-town feel. It's less complicated.
somebody needs money, they just come in and say:
Percy, I need a loan.
right?
and then, of course, you say, "Well, yeah. How much?
they say, "I don't know. You tell me. $50, 000?"
what, you need $50, 000?
do I need $50, 000? - Yeah.
no. I most assuredly do not.
I was just admiring the process.
how many cylinders does a NASCAR engine have, six or eight?
how... - Yeah.
six... or eight...
depending on the gas mileage consumption of the automobile.
you never worked in the pit at NASCAR. You might as well admit it.
all right, you know, fine.
I never really had an aptitude for engines.
Jay... Jeff...
Jeff Gordon didn't really trust me in the pit that much.
but you did drive the cars.
drive? - Yeah.
Absolutely. - Good.
all right! Fine! I never drove NASCAR!
but I was nervous and I wanted to impress you.
you shouldn't have lied.
all right. This is the deal. We go one lap around.
if you beat me, I'll loan you the money.
Really? - I knew it! I knew you needed the money.
I don't need the money!
move over!
Yeah. Fool!
sucker!
move it, man!
what the hell are you doing?
I think it's obvious who came in first. - You're doggone right. You know I won.
I was through the bushes before... - I was through first. I had more speed.
I was through the bushes and on the asphal before you even were at the bushes. - Look.
dispatch, this is 53 Charlie.
Brian, we got a problem. Two cars have jumped...
license and registration.
Poppy! - There's my beautiful girl.
Simon, I want you to meet my granddad.
Hi, there. Howard Jones. - Simon Green. Good to meet you, sir.
nice to meet you.
Hey, Speed Racer. - Hey!
what's with the white kid? - That's Simon. He's my boyfriend.
your boyfriend? You didn't tell me he was white.
Yes, I did. - When?
back at the home. - I thought you was kidding.
okay. Well, I think that's it.
I think you're forgetting about the vodka.
say grace, Percy.
thank you, Lord. Amen.
that was fast. - The Lord knows I'm busy.
Simon, pass on the broccoli, please. - Yes, sir.
so, what, they don't have any available young black men in New York anymore?
they just ran out last week, Grandpa.
I'm just trying to figure out why you chose to go this way.
don't mind him. - It's okay.
my grandmother loved you when she first met you.
but later she said some things. I was like, "Wow, Grandma."
what kind of things? - Yeah, what kind of things?
nothing. Just things.
such as? - Yeah, such as?
daddy? I got it. - I know.
you know what? You're gonna laugh when you hear this.
she said that Theresa was a very pretty girl.
that's so nice. - Good taste.
so I ask her what she liked about you the most, right?
she said...
she says, "I just love her cute, little, nappy little head.
your grandmother, where does she live? - Brooklyn. Why?
I just wanna know how far I'd have to travel to kick her old white ass, that's why!
grandpa.
you don't call my grandchild no nappy head!
did she say that while putting on a sheet for the Klan rally?
settle down, now! Hand me the butter.
my grandmother's not a malicious woman. - No, she's not.
she's 82. She comes from a different time.
I'm 74 and I come from a different time.
you don't hear me calling white folks honky and flat-ass!
Casper. - Cracker.
Ofay. - Peckerwood.
wonder bread. - Bird shit.
bird shit?
it's almost white.
that's pretty good.
Howard. Percy!
it's okay.
I'm really sorry about what my grandmother said...
but there are some people you're just never gonna change as much as you'd like to. - Yep.
I can tell you this. Last Thanksgiving...
my Uncle Dave said a black joke at the table, right?
so I said, right in front of the whole family, "Look, that's inappropriate."
we're not gonna have it.
I think that's how you change people. You just gotta attack it one at a time.
exactly.
what was the joke?
excuse me?
tell the joke.
I don't remember it. - Sure you do. Tell the joke.
really, I don't remember it. It was... - Dad.
chicken.
excuse me? - I didn't stutter.
okay, you know what? I'll tell the joke.
no, Simon. You don't... - Baby, it's okay.
I'll tell you why.
because by not telling the joke, I'm empowering it. Right? So I'll just...
tell the joke and expose how simple-minded and crude and unfunny it actually is.
what do you call...
what do you call 100 black men buried in the ground up to their neck?
what? - Afro-Turf.
that's cute. - What are you laughing at?
it's cute. - Cute don't make it funny.
tell another.
dad, no. - Let the man tell a joke!
I don't know any other ones.
obviously, I've heard other black jokes, but I think I've proven my point.
so it's okay to empower the other ones?
okay. I see what you're doing here, you're putting me on the spot.
it's okay. Look, it's fine. 'Cause I'm not gonna back down.
back down, Simon.
the only way to break down barriers is to have everything out in the open.
right? - Exactly.
so, what do you call...
one black man being chased by 300 white men?
what? - The PGA Tour.
I get it.
tiger Woods. There it is.
that's good.
tell another one.
how do we know that Adam and Eve weren't black?
how?
you ever try to take a rib away from a black man?
that's pretty good.
that's pretty good. - I wouldn't take one from you, I know that!
you chewing it down to the bone. - That's a good one.
he's a rib fan. - Don't try.
tell more. - Okay.
why don't black people like country music? - Why?
cause every time they say "hoe-down," they think someone shot their sister.
you gonna be all right?
that is so true.
that's a tailored joke for you. - Why I gotta be a ho?
ain't nobody talking about you.
it's a sister joke! - You're sisters.
I'm not the "ho" sister.
come on now. Can't stop now, baby.
what are three things that a black man can't get?
what is that he can't get?
a black eye, a fat lip, and a job.
I tell you I'm going to kick this boy's ass!
grandpa. - No, it's...
we know you can take him, but just sit down. Be nice. Come on.
come on, now. It's a joke. - That's right, Daddy.
sit down. It's just a joke.
come on. Hee-hee, ha-ha. That's all it is.
now if you'll excuse me...
all of a sudden, I lost my appetite.
think I'll take a walk.
I should have stopped at "hoe-down." - You should have never started.
this isn't like us at home, laughing about this bullshit.
it's my father's house, Simon.
what do you want me to do, go upstairs and apologize to him again?
no.
let the storm pass. It'll be fine.
besides, he dared you!
he double-dared! He called me chicken. - I heard!
I can't be called chicken. - You have to watch him on those.
you know? I'm fresh out of ideas as to how to impress your father.
telling black jokes is never a good idea, but that's just me.
you think?
I'll talk to him.
say nice things about me.
no, I'm not going to say nice things about you. You are still punished.
baby, I'm a good guy. I like ribs, too. I don't...
why are you being so mean to me?
my grandfather's out there. - He's not going to come in.
this is my mom's kitchen! - She's not going to come in.
you're still gonna do the dishes.
get off me. - Fine, I'll do the dishes.
here, do the broccoli one.
dad, I have to talk to you. - What?
why did you do that? - I didn't start it. Mr. Nappy Head did.
dad, Simon's a good man. He has a good heart.
a good man? - You put him on the spot.
you really think so?
what is your problem with him anyways?
besides the fact, of course, that he's white.
you gonna get in a heap of trouble talking to me like that.
don't care nothing about that man being white. He's hiding something.
what? NASCAR?
you thought I didn't know?
of course I knew. We talk about everything, Simon and I.
daddy, I love him, and you need to start respecting that.
then you respect me enough to tell me in advance who you're bringing home.
I didn't think you'd care. - But you weren't sure.
so you decided to test me. - No, of course not.
so you're looking for a reaction? - No.
so what are you looking for?
I'm looking for you to tell me that it's okay for me to be with him.
I'm scared.
okay?
I'm really scared, Dad.
I know things are different now and times have changed...
but you should really hear the kind of things that people say to us sometimes.
and the way they look at us.
I need you to tell me that it's okay to be with him.
baby, me telling you it's okay is not gonna change the world.
dad. But it would change my world.
it will change my world if I know that you're behind us.
I'm always behind you, sweetheart.
and I love you.
it's my job to keep you safe.
and I don't trust that kid.
Hey, baby. - Yes.
I'm trying to figure out where he got all those doggone black jokes.
what do white people do, take a class...
sit around and think of new jokes about the black man?
I don't know, Percy.
you need to let that one go.
come on, sweetheart. We need to practice the tango.
I told you. I ain't doing no doggone tango.
Why? You think you can't dance anymore?
no. I think the tango's a stupid dance and I ain't doing it.
Marilyn...
why can't we do the hustle? What's wrong with the hustle?
because the hustle is a stupid dance...
and I want to do the tango.
look here, woman, can't we do this some other time?
I gotta take Dad back to the home.
I'll be back. - Okay.
shut up!
okay. - All right, kiss me.
this is the exact spot where I had my first kiss.
No! I'm not going to kiss you in the spot that you had your first kiss.
no. - Why not?
it's some other guy's spot.
fine.
what was his name? - Curtis Booker.
he had these big old Bucky Beaver teeth.
but he was such a nice boy. He was a good kisser, too.
better than me? - Way better.
way better? - Yeah.
did he grab your ass? - No.
squeeze it? - No. We were 13.
grab you down here? - No. Come on!
slow down. - Come on.
there's a car! Get out of the way! - Come on! Yeah!
okay, be careful.
so, this is my favorite spot.
it's pretty amazing, huh?
all right, so it's not the top of the world, but it's nice.
it's a fort.
it's a gun placement.
when I was little, I would sneak out of the house in the middle of the night...
and just come out here and just dream.
yeah?
weren't you afraid of sneaking out of your house?
please. I'm not afraid of Percy Jones.
well, that makes you and... you.
okay, so this is just Cranford.
but it's a great place to grow up. It's a good place to raise a family, too.
you know, maybe we shouldn't do this.
what? Live in the suburbs?
no. Tell your parents about our engagement this weekend.
Simon, I told you not to look at him straight in the eye.
I don't think Percy Jones is ready.
I think Percy Jones needs more time.
a lot more time for Percy Jones.
are you getting cold feet, Simon? - No.
no, I'm not getting cold feet.
I can't wait to marry you.
make babies with you.
give me a daughter that looks just like you.
I can work on that.
yeah? - Yeah.
and hopefully, I can be a good dad.
I think you'll be a great dad.
you're never gonna be like your father, Simon.
maybe I can be like yours.
like Percy? - Yeah.
no. - Baby, Percy Jones is a good dad.
he's there for you.
he cares about you. He loves you so much.
he does.
we just have to get him to love you.
maybe we can start by getting him to take the padlock off the basement door.
it's not going to happen.
why don't you give me a little Curtis Booker?
I can't believe I told you that.
come on, baby, a little Bucky Beaver? - No.
no. How about some Simon Green?
Marilyn, you cut off the porch light?
that's my girl.
very stylish.
I need to take a quarter inch off the pants. I can do it here. Let me have them.
what, you mean take the pants off?
I could do with you in them but I don't want to poke you with my needle.
you keep your eyes on the pants, you hear me?
Mr. Jones, do you know where the extra chairs are?
what are you, blind? They're against the wall.
when you go out, close the door. - Right.
Percy, put some pants on. We got people in the house.
thank you. - Thank you, sweetheart. I didn't realize.
how long's it gonna take?
two shakes of a lamb's tail. - Whatever the hell that means.
mercy, Percy! Keep your shirt on!
or take it off. Whatever.
could someone answer that damn phone? Thank you!
jones residence. - This is Reggie. Who's this?
this is Theresa's boyfriend. - Jamal! What's up, man?
Percy told me all about you. - What's that?
my name is Reggie. Percy told me all about you, man.
he did?
you know what we should do? Get together and play some hoops, man.
I don't really play hoops.
come on, man. Don't be shy. Why are you being shy?
Percy told me that you went to Howard. He said you almost went pro.
he said that? - Yeah.
he was bragging all about you, Jamal. But listen...
two things. One... Could you autograph the issue of Jet for me? And the other thing is, I would love to meet the Cosbys.
when I say love to meet them, I mean I love to meet them.
I'll see what I can do. - I feel like I grew up with them.
let me get Percy for you.
you know, in the '80s and whatnot and...
it's for you. It's Reggie. - We were talking about the Cosbys.
may I have some privacy, please? - But, yeah, you know what I mean?
and shut the door. - I'd still love to meet them.
Reggie. What did you find out?
you were right about Simon Green. He is no longer at J. P. Oliver.
come on. Give me my pants.
jamal, huh? - Don't start.
this isn't about me. It's about you and your job, that you don't have anymore.
what? - Yeah. Move out of my way.
Hey, baby!
Theresa! Come here, sweetheart. Daddy needs to talk to you.
don't listen to him. - What are you talking about?
your boyfriend's unemployed, lost his job. He got fired a couple days ago.
I did not get fired! I quit!
you quit? Why didn't you tell me this?
it's complicated. - It's complicated when you're a liar.
I'm a liar? What about the lies you told Reggie?
Jamal? - Who's Jamal?
he's good friends with the Cosbys. - What about NASCAR?
that was nothing, and I admitted it.
you admitted that you lied. - You tried to kill me with a go-kart.
at least I can drive.
this crazy ass almost got us arrested. Now we both got court dates.
I can't believe you checked up on me.
you kept asking me for money. - I never asked you for money.
you asked my father for money? - $50, 000 loan, baby.
I did not. He trapped me into it. - You're a liar.
you were checking up on him?
he forced my hand. You're my daughter and he's not worthy!
that's not for you to decide. - Right!
and what about you, lying to me? You said you would never lie.
you ain't gotta go over there.
I thought I could get another job.
I was gonna tell you, but I didn't want to ruin the big weekend.
you said we would always tell each other the truth.
like how you told your parents about me being white?
I knew they wouldn't care about that. - I don't care. I care that you're a liar.
that's bullshit! You care. He has to care. It's human nature.
that means that you care that I'm black?
do you? - Dad!
no. It doesn't matter what I say. You people are gonna think I'm a racist.
you hear that? "You people." - I know. I heard. What people?
the people in the yard.
that's what I'm... See? I say one thing and I'm a racist!
no, Simon, you're a liar. - And a racist.
where do you get off calling me a racist? I have a black girlfriend!
you had a black girlfriend! - Have.
past tense! Had! And let me tell you something else, son...
what the hell is going on? - I'll tell you what's going on.
he got fired from J. P. Oliver! - I did not get fired! I quit!
I told you to stay out of Theresa's life. - Thank you.
he can't just walk in our house, telling our baby lies.
I'm not lying! - I don't think so!
the party's off, Percy. - Woman, you must be crazy.
I don't want to say my vows with you. It would be a lie before God.
Marilyn, we're saying some goddamn vows tomorrow.
Yeah, he got a book and everything. - Would you shut up?
you got your vows out of a book?
no. Don't listen to him! I got a book. I'm using it for inspiration.
he wrote it down word for word. - You're going to get hurt.
that is so pathetic! - Come on, Marilyn!
because if memory serves me correctly, I used to be inspiration enough.
you still are!
you'd be inspiration to me. He neglects you.
Marilyn, get your ass back here!
I got a $200 cake coming tomorrow!
sixty pounds of shrimp! Sixty pounds of shrimp, woman!
I had to take a second on the house!
she looked angry. - Marilyn, don't let me raise my voice now!
you gonna force me to use the muscle!
hope you like seafood.
Theresa! Wait!
come on!
they'll be back. - No, they're not coming back.
they gotta come back. Sixty pounds of shrimp!
come on, baby. Pick it up.
answer that phone, sweetheart, and it will be your last.
let me borrow your car.
what? You can't go chasing behind no women. Have some dignity!
besides, you can't even drive a damn go-kart!
trouble in paradise?
baby, we need to talk about this.
you should call me and we should talk about it like adults...
because adults communicate when they have problems.
I'm looking at your photos on the wall and they're beautiful.
beautiful photos. I don't think that I compliment you on your work enough.
you know what? You're being rude. That's what you're being. So call me back.
baby, I'm sorry. You're not being rude.
you have all the reason in the world to be upset with me right now.
you shouldn't be calling me back. If I was you, I wouldn't call me back.
baby, call me back.
call me back, baby.
I'm looking at your bulletin board and there's a picture of you sitting next to a guy and I think that that guy might be Curtis Booker.
he looks like he's got Bucky Beaver teeth.
he looks a lot older than 13!
so I don't know how you feel about it, but it's gone!
old Curtis Booker can go bye-bye!
baby, do you have any Scotch Tape?
you're acting like I cheated on you, and I've never cheated on you except for that one time with myself, and you caught me.
hello.
Darlene! How you doing? This is Percy Jones.
I'm looking for Marilyn. She left a little earlier. I thought she'd be back by now.
I'm sorry. Now, who is this? - Percy Jones.
I'm sorry, Percy. I must have fell asleep on the couch.
baby, you say you looking for Marilyn?
have you seen her? - Well, now, what happened?
What'd you say to my sister, Percy Jones?
nothing.
listen, if you hear from her, can you let me know?
will do. And I look forward to seeing you tomorrow at the party, right?
Yeah, it should be a lot of fun. - Goodbye.
girl!
you will never guess who was just on the phone!
who? - A Mr. Percy A. Jones.
Percy A. Who?
Yeah, well, baby, he is feeling the pain now!
mom. Is that gonna be your last one?
it might be, baby. And it might not.
you should be over there trying to work this out with Dad.
I should be over there trying to work it out with Simon. Mom, please.
child, leave your mom alone. They ain't going nowhere.
your man quit his job and didn't tell you.
got to nip that shit in the bud. - Yes.
no. But... Look, I have 15 missed calls.
fifteen, Mom. Fifteen! - Fifteen?
your baby got 15 missed calls!
bullshit. Let him wait! - That's true.
I'm gonna call him now.
no, you're not! - No. Don't you dare!
child, you take your finger off that trigger!
did he lie to you, Theresa? Did he lie to you?
Yes, he did.
so, if you don't want him to do it again, let him feel the pain!
look, honey, and if you want him that bad, you've got to train him.
my God, if what he's giving you is that good...
and then you still don't want him, send his pasty ass to me!
all right, one more! - Two!
there you go, baby!
here's to you, baby.
I gotta go to work in the morning. Hello?
sorry, Marcus. - I'm sorry, baby.
you want a taste?
thank you, Marcus.
this is my house.
she won't answer the phone. - She don't want to talk to you.
can I get something to drink? - What, vodka?
Yes. Vodka. I would like some vodka.
sorry, Charlie. No vodka.
there's gotta be something around here. Marilyn was throwing an anniversary party.
is throwing a party.
was. - Is.
party's off, dude. - The party is on, dude.
you won't find no liquor in here. This is a Christian home.
bingo.
with a house full of sinners.
Marilyn's got good taste in vodka. This is, like, a $50 bottle.
give me that. Give it here.
can I at least have a little bit? - No.
just a taste.
come around here and get those two glasses over there. Hurry up.
who's playing?
played. That's history.
new York Giants' first Super Bowl win.
talking about Phil Simms. L. T.
you ever play?
I told you before, no. - Pitiful.
all right, let's do it.
do what?
Fumble! - You said you weren't gonna hit me!
Touchdown! Yeah, baby.
this is where your hands go. - Where am I gonna be?
you're on the bottom. I'm on the top. - All right.
okay, so you hold this frame.
one and step. Right.
I'm leading. - Okay.
back. Nice. Step.
left. Good. Double-time.
okay, no. See? This is... - What was wrong with that?
you're screwing around. - I'm not.
you're getting crazy here, not holding your frame.
there must be space between us. Not like when we're sleeping.
you can't be, like, up here.
you're not holding your frame. It's a structured dance.
okay, so back up. - Your mama taught you this?
Yes, I used to help her in the dance studio on the weekends.
step. Two. - You get fired from there, too?
no. I didn't get fired from this job. I quit.
was it over money? Because if it wasn't, this doesn't make any sense.
I had a difference of opinion with the management.
they weren't ready for a guy like me.
I don't get it.
and heads. No, you're doing great.
I ain't talking about this. I'm talking about you and Theresa.
you ain't got nothing in common.
for example:
you don't like sports. Theresa loves sports.
you're a businessman. She's an artist.
you're white. She's black. Did I miss anything?
no. That's just it. She's everything I'm not.
you know, she's my other half. Without her, I'm not whole.
you know, the thing about meeting your other half is...
you're walking around, you think you're happy...
you think that you're whole.
then you realize you ain't shit without her.
then you can't go back to being a half...
cause now you know what it's like to be a whole.
you know what I mean?
Yeah, I do.
and I still got it.
that was nice. - Real nice.
I liked the snap. - You like that?
I think you hurt me. - Percy Jones, boy.
good morning.
looks like I missed a fun night.
just sitting up here, watching football. - That's how it always starts.
Where's Marilyn? - She stayed all night at Darlene's house.
she must be really mad.
wait. You knew where they were the whole time?
Yeah. I thought they'd be back by now.
did you apologize? - I didn't do anything.
Exactly!
Dante, please. Don't try to play that metrosexual mind game on me, okay?
okay. All right.
let's go get them.
you don't understand.
they done called all their friends and sat up all night ragging on men.
they've worked themselves up into a man-hating frenzy.
how many women? - I guarantee you, large numbers.
sisters.
you can't just walk in on a bunch of angry black women. You'll die.
well, we'll just have to go out like men.
he's right, Percy. - I know he's right.
but I'm still scared.
keep talking. What are you saying? - Like that, a little.
I'm liking it. - Thank you.
you gonna share your colors?
you're one of them sisters who don't share colors.
no, I'm not.
give up your secrets, honey.
this is gorgeous. Pink Passion. Every woman needs this.
a little Pink Passion?
you know what I always say?
a little bit of makeup, a little bit of hair ain't never hurt nobody.
how did I know she would be wearing Pink Passion?
Yes, they're in there. - Maybe I should go first.
are you crazy? I'm the one that got experience in this sort of thing.
you just pay attention. I'll show you how it's done.
here, straighten yourself up.
if you go up in there, you go in looking like a man.
wipe this off. - You got something.
thank you. Yeah.
man, I'm not gonna... - No. We gotta do this.
well, well, well.
if it isn't Mr. Percy Jones. - It is I.
it's about time you showed up.
what's up? - I'm well.
Percy. - Marilyn.
Marilyn, may I speak to you in private over there, please...
so the ladies can continue eating?
Oh, no! You go on home with that.
it's not going down like that, my brother. - No way, no how.
you know better than that, Percy. You got something to say, say it here.
in front of everybody.
step up to the chalk line and be a man.
I married you, didn't I? Don't that count for something?
hell, no! - What does he want, an award?
that don't count for nothing!
it really doesn't count.
come on, man. - I know, I'm just...
Oh, hell.
I was wrong, okay?
it's a good start, Percy. - Keep going!
I've been wrong for a long time.
ever since I forgot that you are my better half.
hell, Marilyn, you're everything I'm not.
without you, I'm not whole.
look. Let...
baby, before I met you, I thought I was all that.
and then you came into my life, and I realized that I wasn't all that.
wasn't even half of that.
I might have been a quarter of that.
but then you left me last night!
and, baby, I remembered how it felt to be without you.
and let me tell you something. I ain't shit without you!
dad. - Man.
and I forgot about that.
and I'm sorry.
baby, marry me.
make me whole again.
I love you, Percy. - I love you, too.
that's what I'm talking about, baby. - You go, Marilyn, bad girl!
kiss your baby.
I missed you so much. - I missed you.
I couldn't sleep at all last night. I'm sorry, baby.
I feel so much better!
isn't that lovely? - Get off that.
I guess it's my turn.
all right.
that's going to be a tough speech to follow.
it was a great speech, Perce. - Thank you.
I had something similar in mind. - Great minds think alike.
admitting you were wrong would be a great start.
Yes, it would.
right.
go ahead, man.
baby, I was wrong!
what are you doing?
I want to see your sexy body go bump, bump, bump.
we have to talk in private.
I don't wanna hear it. No. Mom?
just stay here and talk about it in front of everybody!
ladies, please.
take your man and go work out your business.
that's right.
go on.
thank you.
don't let him work on you. - That ain't right.
did he say "bump, bump, bump"? - Yeah, and it's Percy's fault.
it's all your fault!
those kids are in love and they finally liked each other and you all interfere.
my love right here. Don't tell me how to define my love!
lord have mercy.
baby.
come on.
I was trying to impress your father.
I didn't want to show up here and be the unemployed fiance.
I've never lied to you before and I'll never lie to you again, ever.
you lied about asking my father for a loan.
that was an omission that was tied to a previous lie. That doesn't...
and I look like an idiot to you.
no. You look a little bit like Percy Jones, though.
I can't believe you're trying to be funny.
baby, come on. - Why do you have to be funny right now?
don't touch me!
you need to calm down.
you made me look like an asshole in there. Don't tell me to calm down.
I think you were doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
not telling them about me?
and then I pitched in and I blew it, okay?
I panicked when I found out that Nathan was blackballing me.
I thought if I could score this IPO, I'd have enough money until I got another job.
but I was doing that for you. - What am I, your mother?
I don't need you to take care of me.
I want you to do things with me, not for me, Simon!
will you just talk to me? - I am talking to you.
you're talking at me. - I am talking to you.
but you need to talk to me and tell me how am I supposed to believe in you when you don't trust me enough to tell me the truth?
how do we get past this, with this skin, if we don't have each other's back?
okay, I'm always gonna be the white boy. - And I'll always be the black girl.
but at least I'm here and willing to deal with it, and I don't know about you.
I don't know. And eventually, if you're gonna quit on me, just do it and don't...
I'm standing right here!
what more do you want from me? What do you want from the white boy?
I've been here busting my ass to make you happy!
then let me make this easy for you! The engagement is off!
fine.
good. - Great.
great.
I'm in Jersey!
okay, stand still now. - I'm still.
you all right?
I'm fine.
I'm great. It's going to be a great day, Dad.
it sure is. - Yes. I'm gonna take lots of pictures.
so you better smile big for me, okay? - I will.
and no crying. Mom said you cried last time.
I was not crying, I was sweating from my eyeballs.
hell, I was nervous. I knew I was making a big mistake.
a 25-year mistake.
and going for 25 more.
sweetheart?
why don't you call that man?
you know he got his cell phone on. You know he does.
he's probably waiting on the 5: 15 train.
we got a party going on. You get his ass back here!
how many missed calls you have last night?
thirty-three.
Thirty-three? - Yeah.
Thirty-three? - Yeah.
thirty-three missed calls? Sweetheart, that's major.
and you know the man is unemployed, yes, but he calls you. So give him that.
thirty-three missed calls? And you can't call him once?
girl, don't be so proud. - No. Daddy, it's not...
pride ain't nothing when it comes to matters of the heart.
it's not that.
it's not? - No.
I was going to marry him. - What?
we were going to announce our engagement this weekend.
so, you see?
I have you to thank...
because you saved me from a big heartache.
sweetheart, I just don't understand something.
why did Simon quit his job? - I don't know. He didn't say.
why would a man quit his job on the day he's gonna meet his future father-in-law?
maybe he got tired of waiting for that promotion that never happened.
Simon's a rising star, Dad.
he really is. - I believe that.
but that boss of his is just not a nice man.
you ever met him? - A couple of times.
he was always friendly, kind of.
but he always had this look in his eyes, you know?
just not a nice man.
but he was Simon's mentor, so...
whatever.
let it go.
today is about you and Mom.
now, first picture of the night.
let me get my... On my good side. - Smile.
I don't want Mom to see me like this.
I love you, Dad. - I love you, too.
Damn!
no.
do not do this to me, Percy Jones!
we have a schedule! Tick-tock. Everything works. Timing.
I'll be right back.
timing! - I'll be right back.
in 10 minutes? - Or so, okay?
how so?
I'm sorry. Percy, have you met my wife, Diane?
I certainly have heard a lot about you, Percy Jones.
nice to meet you.
does Marilyn know you're going AWOL? - Of course.
she does not.
so you missed your train, huh?
there's another one at 6: 00. - You gonna be on it?
I should have been on that one.
what are you doing here?
I know why you quit your job.
you told your boss you was coming here to meet me and he said:
don't marry that black girl.
those weren't exactly the words.
how did you know we were getting married?
I told you, son. Don't nothing get past Percy Jones.
Theresa told you. - That, too.
come on, man. Let's get real.
what you did with your boss was honorable, impressive...
and stupid.
you can't quit your job every time somebody rolls their eyes at the two of you.
you'll never make any money.
how do you do 25 years? - Painfully.
no, seriously.
if you're gonna marry one of these women, sometimes it's gonna hurt like hell.
all you can do is admit that you're wrong and know that she's always right.
she's right? - That's right.
always? - Right.
right. - That's right.
all right.
okay, what about all the talk about my dignity?
do you love her? Do you want her?
then she's always right.
look, I know I didn't give you a fair shake.
and I was wrong.
and my daughter, she'd be lucky to have you.
I'm not a quitter, Mr. Jones.
I think I know that about you.
Theresa doesn't.
you just have to show her what you're made of.
you know she's hot-headed. She's just like her mama.
every man gets to choose his destiny, son.
no matter what his father did.
and, Percy, you are not perfect.
but that works for me because two perfect people in one relationship might be too much.
and sometimes you bark and bluff and bluster...
but I always see the boy I married 25 years ago.
and I only wish I loved him as much as I did back then, but I don't.
I love him more.
thank you, Marilyn. That was lovely.
Percy? Your vows?
Marilyn Jones.
everyone knows I didn't write my vows.
everyone knows because you kept beating me up about it for weeks...
crying to all your friends. You know?
now, look here, woman. I love you.
but you didn't have to do me like that about my vows.
you know I don't like writing. She knows that.
I'm not a wordsmith.
I do numbers. That's me. I don't do words.
damn it, I do money.
and after 25 years, all I've asked you...
is to let me be me.
you'll never find
as long as you shall live
Oh, Lord.
someone to love you
love you, love you
tender like I do
tender like I do
you know that about me, woman.
you'll never find
no matter where you search
I'm not looking.
someone to care about you
care about you, care about you
the way I do
Oh, I'm not bragging on myself, baby
but I'm the only one that loves you
I think I forgot what love is until you and Simon showed up.
give that man another chance, daughter.
you'll never find
Simon!
Yes, Simon.
it'll take the end of all time
someone who understands you
like I do
that's not Jamal.
I could probably find a million reasons why we shouldn't be together.
but you know what? I don't care.
I don't care, either.
I love you.
and I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry, too.
you're sorry?
can you say that again? - I'm sorry, Simon.
you're sorry? She said she was sorry. I believe she's...
I'm sorry, Simon.
get your man, girl! - Go ahead, sweetie!
ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure...
to introduce to you all my future son-in-law, Simon Green.
he's broke, unemployed, and he's white.
but he loves my Theresa and that's all right with us.
that's right.
welcome to the family, son. Welcome to the family.
and cue the magic.
look at this.
will you look at that shit?
drink up! Enjoy!
welcome, man.
let's watch the tango. - No, let's watch the party.
all right. Get your feet off the table. - Sorry, sir.
I look pretty good out there. - You do, Mom.
baby, you look so good because you're twirling around me.
Oh, yeah, there you go, there you go.
all right, you blew that part.
that was perfect. - There was hesitation there.
you did it better the night before. - The night before?
what happened? - We had a little dry run the night before.
Really? - You didn't tell me that, Percy!
you're hallucinating, Simon. I ain't never danced with no man in my life.
taught him everything he knows.
Percy Jones was born knowing how to tango.
and let me tell you something about the tango.
it's a structured dance. - I told you that.
what was that, Mom?
you know what that is, Theresa. You're a grown-ass woman.
damn, Mama, you still got it. - I know it, Keisha.
all right now, watch this. This is when I got funky.
go, Percy! It's your birthday! - Go, Percy.
let's watch the vows. - No!
watch the party. - Okay, fine, whatever.
there you are. - I got her, that girl is mine!
I was just shocked you didn't fall down.
that is cold.
look. Check me out. I am doing the hustle.
I'm doing the hustle in your honor, Percy Jones.
that ain't no damn hustle. That's the white man overbite.
you ain't even doing that right. - Why's it gotta be a white thing?
blacks have overbites, too.
he's doing a great hustle! - He's turning it up.
why is my man looking at your ass? - No, he's not.
why is your man Samoan?
where is Manu these days? - We broke up last week.
thank you, Jesus. - What happened?
I only started going out with him to mess with Daddy.
and, girl, please. He is too big. He is a bone crusher.
watch your mouth! - What?
do not use the word "bone" in my house.
where were you all going? - Let's see that again.
your mother and I got a sudden thirst for punch.
no. You're old enough to know.
we going to shake some sheets. Is that all right with you?
I thought you said no bone in the house!
No!
if everyone wants to see the lift, we do the lift.
we're doing the lift!
this is good.
no. I was so sure you were going to drop me there.
I love you!
this is Dirty Dancing. I've been doing this since high school.
look at that.
who's the man? - You did it with other girls?
no, I only do that with you.
I know that hurt.
see that move right there. That's why you're not getting any grandkids.
let me call your mama right now and thank her for those dance lessons.
that's a low blow. - It's just a joke.
Simon! - Come on. I'll catch your big ass.
we're down!
good thing is, she didn't break that dress.
no, she didn't, but she felt bad about it all week.
they gotta go deep.
I knew better. - Oh, my God.
that was a great party. - It was, Mom.
Yeah, I guess a party not a party till something get broke.
Melinda: THERE'S A DOOR IN THE ARCHIVES THAT LEADS TO THE TUNNELS.

it's JUST SUCH A LETDOWN, YOU KNOW?
every TIME IT DOESN'T HAPPEN, I
I DON'T WANT TO LET HER DOWN, TOO.
Hey, IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
we've ONLY BEEN TRYING 4 MONTHS.
I KNOW.
Oh, NO.
clancy, YEAH.

I'll BE THERE IN 5 MINUTES.
there's A MULTIPLE VICTIM FIRE AT ROCKLAND UNIVERSITY,
one OF THE OFFICE BUILDINGS.

no.
Jim: HONEY, I'M GONNA GO CHECK WITH THE COMMANDER.
Melinda: EXCUSE ME, HAVE YOU SEEN RICK PAYNE?
professor PAYNE?
Hey, WHAT DO WE GOT?

I HAVE, BUT USUALLY WHEN I'M STANDING IN FRONT OF A MIRROR.
you're OK. YEAH.
I'm MORE THAN OK. I MEAN, ASK AROUND. YOU'LL HEAR THAT
so WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU ANSWER YOUR PHONE?!
Melinda, I TALKED YOU ON THE TELEPHONE AN HOUR AGO!
I TALKED TO YOU INSIDE MY HOME.

Oh. THE SHADOW THING.

man: PLEASE, HELP ME OUT.
congratulations ON SAVING THAT GUY.
nice JOB. WELL DONE.
Hi.
how LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON?
ever SINCE HE REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS.
who IS HE?
his NAME'S ELI JAMES.
he's A PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR
with A THERAPY PRACTICE AT THE UNIVERSITY.
his OFFICE WAS IN THE BUILDING THAT BURNED.
are HIS EYES OK?
Yeah, IT'S JUST SWELLING FROM THE SMOKE.
he's FINE.
how LONG HAS HE LIVED IN GRANDVIEW?
I DON'T KNOW. WHY?
and SO IT CAUGHT ME, LIKE, HORRIFICALLY,
and THEN I- HI...
Eli, MY NAME IS MELINDA GORDON.
Oh, UH...
sorry IF I DON'T GET UP.
this IS MY FRIEND FIONA.
Hi.
nice TO MEET YOU.
should I KNOW THAT NAME?
we've NEVER MET BEFORE,
which IS... ODD, IN A WAY.
Why? ARE YOU IN THE PSYCH DEPARTMENT?
no.
gambler's ANONYMOUS?
no. WAIT.
if YOU'RE THAT GIRL FROM THE ELECTRIC SHOCK STUDY,
those ELECTRODES WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO
OK, IT'S OK, ELI,
I UNDERSTAND. I...
I CAN TALK TO THEM, TOO.
talk TO WHO?
ghosts.
if YOU WORK IN THE HOSPITAL,
this IS DEFINITELY NOT POST-TRAUMA COUNSELING PROTOCOL.
no ONE TOLD YOU. TOLD ME WHAT?
you KNOW WHAT, IT'S REALLY BETTER IF I
told ME WHAT?
Eli, FIONA DIED
in THAT FIRE WITH YOU.
they COULDN'T BRING HER BACK, I'M SO SORRY.
Where's FIONA?
I JUST TOLD YOU.
she's DEAD.
then WHO WAS I TALKING TO?
you WERE TALKING TO HER GHOST.
so DO YOU THINK HE'S ANOTHER ONE LIKE YOU?
and THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT HIM TO GRANDVIEW,
like YOUR MOM AND GABRIEL AND ALL THOSE OTHERS?
I DON'T THINK SO.
there's SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT HIM.
I DON'T THINK HE'S HERE FOR THE SAME REASONS I AM.
and I'M GUESSING THAT YOU'RE WISHING
I WOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT NED INTO THIS.
no, I-I WISH I KNEW HOW TO PARTICIPATE,
but IT'S LIKE YOU'RE SPEAKING SOME STRANGE FOREIGN LANGUAGE.
I UNDERSTAND THE WORDS, BUT IT ALL...
adds UP TO GIBBERISH.
so WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE GHOST?
she WAS ONE OF HIS PATIENTS.
they WERE CAUGHT IN THE FIRE TOGETHER.
he WAS REVIVED. I WISH I KNEW MORE.
Yeah, LIKE WHAT THEY WERE DOING TOGETHER IN HIS OFFICE AT 10 P. M.
well, THAT PART I UNDERSTOOD.
Melinda: HEY.
mind IF I COME IN?
Melinda, HEY.
how ARE YOU DOING?
you're ASKING ME THAT?
you're THE ONE WITH THE GHOST PROBLEM.
no, I'M THE ONE WITH POST TRAUMATIC STRESS.
I LOST A PATIENT, AND IN CASE YOU FORGOT,
I KINDA DIED.
it TAKES A LOT LESS TO MAKE SOMEONE THINK YOU HEARD VOICES.
sounds VERY RATIONAL.
look, IF THIS IS A CRY FOR HELP, I CAN HELP YOU
with YOUR DEPRESSION, YOUR ANXIETY.
even YOUR SELF-ESTEEM ISSUES.
but I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I DON'T DO WELL WITH YOUR TYPE OF NUT JOB.
my TYPE OF NUT JOB?
Yeah. BIZARRE BELIEFS, SUPERSTITIOUS BEHAVIOR.
people USE THAT TO HIDE FROM THEIR REAL PROBLEMS, OK?
I DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE, YOU MIGHT SAY.
Wow. IS THIS THE KIND OF BEDSIDE MANNER
that THEY'RE TEACHING THESE DAYS?
I'm SORRY.
I LIKE TO KEEP IT REAL.
so I TAKE IT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYMORE GHOSTS?
safe ASSUMPTION. THAT'S A LIE!
Really? YOU CAN SEE THROUGH MY EYES?
you're A MIND READER NOW?
you're TELLING THE TRUTH.
I'm TELLING THE TRUTH, I'M LYING,
make UP YOUR MIND, LADY.
you CAN'T SEE THEM, BUT YOU CAN HEAR THEM.
say THAT AGAIN.
why DON'T YOU TELL HIM?
whenever I TALK TO HIM, HE SHOUTS AT THE NURSES TO QUIET DOWN,
acting LIKE I'M NOT HERE.
but I KNOW HE HEARS ME.
I CAN SEE HIM REACTING.
why WON'T HE LISTEN TO ME?
because HE DOESN'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT.
because IF IT'S TRUE AND HE HEARS YOU,
then HE MIGHT BE A NUT JOB.
I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE, OK?
you CAN'T JUST SHUT THEM OUT.
it's ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.
look, I CAN HELP YOU. JUST PLEASE
it's NOT JUST THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD GHOSTS BEFORE THIS.
I WAS THERE. OK, I SAW ELI'S SPIRIT
leave HIS BODY AND THEN COME BACK.
I've NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.
Oh, AND THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING YOU THESE BOOKS.
these BOOKS COVER ALL OF THAT AND MORE, OK?
paranormal PHENOMENA, MYTHS, THEORIES ABOUT THE BEYOND.
you're ALL RIGHT.
how COME EVERYONE IS TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM ME?
Ah, FINALLY, THE REAL ISSUE,
instead OF THIS GHOST STORY THAT YOU'RE HIDING BEHIND.
Yeah, I HAVE ENOUGH SHRINKS IN MY LIFE, THANK YOU.
Melinda, I'M NOT A VERY SENSITIVE GUY, OK?
it ONCE TOOK A GIRLFRIEND 6 MONTHS TO BREAK UP WITH ME 'CAUSE I THOUGHT SHE WAS EXPRESSING DISBELIEF
every TIME SHE SAID, "GET OUT."
even I CAN TELL YOU'RE UPSET.
I AM NOT UPSET.
there IS NOTHING ABOUT ME THAT IS UPSET, OK?
you're LEAVING FOR A SABBATICAL IN A FEW DAYS
for SOME NEW, IMPORTANT FIND IN THE HIMALAYAS,
and I AM VERY HAPPY FOR YOU. WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?
I'm GLAD WE HAD THIS CHAT.
it WAS VERY REFRESHING, CLEANSING.
you'd LIKE TO KNOW WHY THIS ELI CHARACTER, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
he CAN HEAR GHOSTS, RIGHT?
right. AND IT OBVIOUSLY HAS SOMETHING TO DO
with HIM DYING AND THEN COMING BACK.
it HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THAT.
N.D.E. LITERATURE IS CHOCK FULL OF STORIES LIKE HIS.
N.D.E. YOU MEAN NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE?
Yeah. UH, HERE'S HOW IT USUALLY WORKS.
you DIE, YOU COME BACK TO LIFE,
and IN SOME VERY RARE CASES,
there's A, UH, A THREAD
that CONNECTS YOU TO WHERE YOU WERE,
a TETHER, IF YOU WILL.
so HOW COME HE CAN HEAR GHOSTS BUT HE CAN'T SEE THEM?
some N. D.E. s CAN SEE THE GHOSTS,
some CAN HEAR THEM, SOME CAN EVEN SMELL THEM,
and THAT'S THE WORST BECAUSE EVERYTHING ON THE OTHER SIDE
smells LIKE STINKY, ROTTEN EGGS.
Ugh. AND THAT'S PERMANENT?
it VARIES, IT VARIES.
sometimes YOUR SENSES GOT STRONG
as YOUR BRAIN PROCESSES THE NEW INPUT,
other TIMES THE THREAD SNAPS,
and YOU'RE JUST A POOR, SIGHTLESS MOLE LIKE ME.
your FRIEND ELI, NOT UNIVERSALLY LIKED HERE AT SCHOOL.
who DOESN'T LIKE HIM?
a LOT OF PEOPLE.
but MOST OF MEMBERS OF THE "I DON'T LIKE THAT GUY ELI" FAN CLUB
are IN HIS OWN DEPARTMENT.
they THINK HE'S A BIT OF A COWBOY.
breaks A LOT OF RULES,
which NORMALLY I WOULD APPLAUD... BUT?
but THEY SAY HE DOES SO AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS PATIENTS.
you KEEP THINKING EVERY NEW DAY
will BE DIFFERENT,
but IT NEVER IS.
day AFTER DAY
buddy?
after DAY- BUDDY.
after DAY
Hey, BUDDY. AFTER DAY
you SAID YOU WANTED A SHOT OF SOMETHING. WHAT WILL IT BE?
I'm SORRY. I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
I ALREADY TURNED DOWN THE MUSIC.
what's YOUR PROBLEM?
Hey!
I THINK MAYBE YOU NEED TO CALL SOMEBODY.
you THINK?
look! WHOEVER YOU PEOPLE ARE,
I CAN'T HELP ANY OF YOU!
especially IF I'M UNDER A BUS,
and THAT'S MY NEXT STOP!
everybody just shut up!
you're THE ONE WHO CALLED ME?
Yeah, HE SAID YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP.
he SCARED ALL MY BUSINESS AWAY, I HAD TO CALL THE POLICE.
well, YOU CAN CALL THE POLICE BACK
and TELL THEM EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OK.
who ARE YOU, HIS DOCTOR?
I KNOW THIS IS GONNA SOUND STRANGE,
but IF YOU WANT YOUR BAR BACK
Hey, DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO.
great.
