Really? So what was the other point?
Really? So what were you doing at the time that this attempt was made on your life?
Really? So what's your method?
Really? So when you hit me with a door twice,
Really? So who are you doing?
Really? So why have I been listening to this bullshit all summer?
Really? So why's he still here?
Really? So you changed your mind?
Really? So you have no idea why I wasn't invited to that fact?
Really? So you imagined me living in a place for eight months...
Really? So you mean...
Really? So you think you can just replace me?
Really? So you think you might actually like me?
Really? So you thought Flynn was volunteering, too?
Really? So you're gonna shoot this movie one minute at a time, just to punish me?
Really? So you're not mad?
Really? So you're saying the dive teams
Really? So, anyway, thanks again. Okay.
Really? So, how's it work, then?
Really? So, just try, see whether I will feel dizzy or not
Really? So, what's that one about?
Really? So, why...
Really? So, you know the way things are in here?
Really? So, you want us to believe that you're just a glorified thief?
Really? So, you're just gonna sit here and wait till she comes crawling back, are you?
Really? So... So, what, I could just shoot you right now and nothing happens?
Really? So... What did he say?
Really? Some of those guys seriously need to get a life.
Really? Somebody pushed you?
Really? Someone breaking into your house, stringing up a noose, doesn't mean anything?
Really? Something that was overlooked by all of the accountants whose actual job it is to find weird things?
Really? Sorry I didn't know
Really? Sorry, no excuses.
Really? Sorry.
Really? Sounded like you choose.
Really? Sounds like a nice job.
Really? Sounds more like you found the self-help section in the bookstore.
Really? Special forces?
Really? Still with the laser eyes?
Really? Still? The pigeon?
Really? Stolen?
Really? Stop the assault, man.
Really? Strange that in a country that officially spends more money on internal security measures, censorship and control of the internet than on its military, beijing has not been able to shut a few sites that sell purloined music and videos.
