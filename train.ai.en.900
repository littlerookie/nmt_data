I'm serious, Pen. Why should...
why should Emily have to put up with secondhand toys, secondhand clothes, secondhand life?
Charlie, you, you have your book.
you have me and Emily.
and that makes us rich.
Hi.
Ohh, wooh, what a crazy night.
my car ran out of gas.
are you gonna order something?
sure. Beer, please.
one of your finest mass produced...
my friend, Gus, um...
you know Gus. Gus Dickinson.
works at the, works down at the call center.
Reverend Smalls?
and that's where he is now.
walking down that road to the station.
Reverend Smalls.
the old blind guy who runs the station keeps it open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
old blind guy is celebrating his 80th birthday tonight.
who the hell are you?
uh, I'm the guy that's here to collect the money.
gimme your gun.
I don't have one.
you come to get money from me and you ain't even packing?
give my regards to the big bearded guy.
you don't mean Santa Claus, do ya?
Gus!
Gus!
Gus?
Gus!
Oh, my...
if It's you, Jose, fuck off and don't call back.
everybody else, please leave a message.
Josie. Josie! Pick up.
Josie. Josie, are you there?
we have a real problem here. Pick up.
Gus.
Gus.
Gus.
Gus, are you there?
Gus!
Gus!
Oh, my God! What happened?
what are you doing here?
what? The station's closed.
our alibi? So I came here and I found...
calm down.
what the hell happened?
the bastard pulled a gun on me. He was gonna shoot me and I grabbed the gun. It went off accidentally. No biggie.
no biggie?
I conked him on the head with a vase.
he's gonna wake up any minute now.
Oh, Gus.
I think I made a big mistake.
did you call the cops?
I, I put him in the septic tank.
the corpse.
what corpse?
the Reverend's corpse.
the Reverend wasn't a corpse when I left him, Charlie.
there was blood. I saw blood.
it was my blood. He shot me through the leg.
it went clean through the muscle.
Oh, my God.
why didn't you answer when I called you?
I was in the bathroom cleaning the wound.
well, I checked his pulse.
I mean, well, maybe I missed it. I mean, 17%.
you missed it?
what? Can't we get him out of the tank?
Oh, yeah. How long he's been down there?
ten minutes tops. What?
I thought I said no matter what stick to the fucking plan!
there wasn't anything in the fucking plan about the blind guy's birthday and the Reverend in a pool of blood!
let's calm down, okay?
what about you? Don't you need a doctor?
Yeah. Slightly more pressing matter to tackle first.
what are you doing?
he's crying.
Jesus, Gus, he's crying for what we've done. For our sin.
Jesus! Hail Mary, full of grace...
bathtub.
God damn it!
is that part of your plan, huh?
after you kill someone you take a nice hot bath?
I didn't kill anybody, first of all. Second,I don't go round praying to leaky ceilings!
well, you know what? I'm having a tough time here, okay?
I just drowned a man of the cloth in crap!
maybe I should just turn myself in.
Oh, no, no. Nobody is turning anybody in, okay?
did you know the priest was alive when you killed him?
No!
there you go, then.
how could we have thought a Reverend would have $200, 000 in cash?
the average household savings of an American couple between 35 and 50 is $15, 256. I mean, it's...
Charlie? Charlie.
shut up!
wait, wait, wait.
no, no. Rule number four. Never return to the scene of the crime.
it's Josie's card. I left it by the phone.
rule number five. If your partner turns out to be an idiot, forget rule number four.
it's gone.
got it.
Ouch! What the fuck!
God damn it! Ow!
shouldn't we be going?
aren't you just a little curious?
have a look right there.
this beauty, huh? Here we go.
look at this.
this is for you, alright? Alright?
she's an actress, right?
shut up, alright? You like this, baby?
do you like this? Do you like to feel that?
Yeah. Yeah. Do you know what this is?
I am gonna carve your face up, huh?
shut up.
if I didn't know better, you know what I'd say it looks like?
shut up!
a snuff film?
holy Moly!
who says "Holy Moly"?
is it important right now?
this is why he was so keen to cop a deal, 'cause he's part of a snuff film ring.
we gotta call the Police.
what are we gonna tell them we're doing in here?
if they find the body...
they're not gonna find the body.
the septic tank was genius. Look at it this way.
we may have saved lives tonight.
what? You think he's the Oregon Undertaker?
who knows. But undertaker or not he sure as hell got what he deserved.
Charlie. Charlie, wait!
do you mind if I come in?
what?
we found the Reverend's body.
it was an accident.
no, this was no accident.
someone shot him three times in the head.
left him in his car by the side of the road.
it's a, it's a horrid pill to swallow.
murder always is.
I'm sorry. Are you certain that it's the Reverend Smalls?
we've got positive ID.
then, who's...
who's what?
who is... safe in this God forsaken world?
are you family?
Yeah. No! Just a friend.
a family friend.
and your name is?
Steven.
steven Hawking.
mind if I?
you're watching a DVD, huh?
Yeah. No.
I mean, did you know that DVD sales have risen by 226% over the last six months?
well, no.
but I sure am 100% glad to know that!
thanks for the factoid.
so, um, can I, can I get you a drink?
glass of H2O if you please, Mr. Hawking.
there's some blood on the floor.
Mr. Hawking?
I broke a vase, and accidentally cut my arm on one of the shards.
look.
whoa, doggy.
that hurts just looking at it.
what are you doing?
just getting a sample. Standard procedure, of course.
detective Wood's expecting you back at the station.
copy that.
detective Wood, always breathing down my neck.
ain't had a good poke in a while, if you ask me.
I'm not asking. But whatever.
well, I'd better get a move on.
Mm. What a beautiful night.
you can almost touch those stars, huh?
Yeah.
although even if you were traveling the speed of light it would take you 1, 460 days to reach the closest one.
is that right?
well, you are just a walking factoid factory, partner.
you have yourself a good night.
you, too, Officer.
Oh.
would you mind if I took a gander at that DVD you were watching?
curiosity killed the cat, Officer.
actually in my line of work, the cat gets a raise and a promotion.
my nine-year-old loves this one.
specially this part with this singing cow.
I've got to admit, Steven.
for a minute there, I thought you were hiding something.
kind of looks like something got dragged here, don't it?
you wanna come with me?
I need you to lift this up for me, Steven.
officer, you don't wanna...
open it.
so much for the raise and the promotion, Officer.
there we go.
see, I knew Columbo here would come back for the DVD.
okay. What do we do with him?
I've a better question. Who is in the septic tank?
how do I know? Check the papers in the morning.
see who turns up missing.
and then what, Gus? We killed somebody.
Oh, now, you killed somebody.
well, you kidnapped a cop.
Oh, yes. Yes, I did. What do you propose?
I'm turning myself in.
you realize they'll charge you with the real Reverend's murder.
I had nothing to do with that!
what do they care? Makes it all nice and neat for them.
no messy loose ends! I bet good money they'll be all "Gosh damn it, we done finally caught us the Undertaker."
you'll be spitting fire and crying sparks in no time.
enough. Let's not make this any worse than it is.
Charlie, how could this be any worse?
you're not going anywhere.
you gonna shoot me, Gus?
I got a family, too, Charlie.
I am not going to jail.
I am going to shoot you, Charlie.
no, you're not.
Yes, I am!
no, you're not.
Yes, I am!
shit!
Ah, I knew you wouldn't...
I wouldn't do that.
who the hell are you?
considering that I live here, young man,I think the question is, "who the hell are you?"
it's not what you think, Mrs. Smalls.
we're not burglars.
look, we have some terrible news.
your husband, the Reverend, has passed on.
I went through the trouble of putting three bullets in his head,
I should certainly hope so.
Mrs. Smalls, you've the right to remain silent.
Oh, please.
so you killed him?
I spent years turning a blind eye to that pervert's, uh, shall we say "film-making aspirations"?
Max and I felt we deserved a share of his benefits.
who's Max?
a real man.
we're meeting here, and then we're going somewhere where we'll never worry about anything ever again.
um...
what?
I think he may already be there.
what are you talking about?
he never would've left without me.
didn't really have a choice.
it was an accident. Would you shut up?
why don't you both shut up?
alright. Where is the money?
sorry? What money?
two million dollars in cash doesn't just vanish.
two m...
Yeah, where is it?
Oh, dear.
I guess I'll just have to count to three. One.
Mrs. Smalls, don't.
tell her where it is.
we don't know!
two.
well, I'll be... I haven't heard Pink Floyd in years.
southbound train on Track One.
POLICE-- stop!
stop! Stop! Stop, now!
hold your positions!
exercise is terminated. Hold your positions.
hold your positions. Exercise is terminated.
good work.
we foiled a sarin attack.
excellent job.
but my undercover sheriffs...
you would've done better if you kept the bad guys alive...
get information...
so we're going to do it again.
everybody get set up.
we're doing it again.
conductor!
conductor, open the doors!
open the doors!
conductor, open the doors now!
everybody out! Out, out, out!
what have we got?
the guy in charge.
but then he didn't want to speak to me until you got here.
Hey.
James Grace, Homeland Security. Don Eppes,
FBI... so, James, you want to give me a little rundown here?
we were conducting an anti-terror drill:
testing new bio-chem sensors and our response.
at the end of the drill, a few of the sensors went off for real, indicating that there was some kind of release of toxin into the air.
do you know what it was?
HazMat's identified it as phosgene, a relative of chlorine.
everyone on the train were either MTA employees or undercover cops.
I was told six of them went to the hospital, but everybody's okay.
wait, didn't we get a memo, right, that you guys were planning more drills?
this was just our first one.
we got ten more in L. A. the next seven days.
James, what the hell happened?
we don't know yet, Peter.
special Agent Eppes, Special Agent Reeves, FBI.
from Homeland Security... oversees these drills.
glad to have the Bureau's help.
what can you tell me?
don: I just got here, but I can tell you
I think you should put your other exercises on hold.
sorry, but that's not an option.
not an option?
we've been planning these exercises for the past year.
I've got drills in nine different cities in the next six months.
we pack up now, we won't be coming back.
well, I understand that, but until we find out what happened here...
we'll continue to run these tests...
in L. A.'s local airport, in the hospitals, in the harbors...
I'm not going to compromise the safety of Los Angeles because some janitor left the lid off a jar.
washington thinks the chances of this being an actual terrorist attack are slim to none.
I agree.
and that's based on...?
logic.
terrorists go after maximum casualties.
they don't go after anti-terror drills.
MEGAN: That is one type of profile.
there are so many others.
you think somebody did this deliberately, it is your job to find them.
see, I didn't realize the FBI takes orders from Homeland Security.
fine.
you've got your work cut out for you.
and I've got a job to do of my own.
your boss always this reasonable?
he's right.
stop the drills now, it's like turning the Titanic.
the Titanic hit an iceberg.
we all use math every day.
to predict weather...
to tell time...
to handle money.
math is more than formulas and equations...
logic...
Rationality...
it's using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.
Hey, Dad, you seen Cha...
...right.
40 portable chairs, a banquet table, and an arbor.
for Saturday.
okay, great. See you then.
an arbor?
you're right, that upstairs bedroom would make a great changing room.
good.
Val? Hey, Don.
it's been a long time.
since high school graduation.
look at you-- you look great.
thank you. I think the last time I saw you, you were driving off in that VW you had.
my clutch gave out right by Ventura.
what's going on?
she's getting married. Yeah, right here.
Yup. Oh, you're kidding.
what, here at the house?
VAL: Yeah, my fiance and I were planning a big June wedding but then he just got transferred to London this year, and my mother, she flew into a total panic...
Val's parents invited us to the wedding and I found out what was going on.
they just sold their place and moved into a one-bedroom on Wilshire...
so, I said, "What the hell, it's no problem.
have it here." Sure, why not?
thank you.
Wow. So, um...
you're an FBI agent.
had to make amends somehow.
and what are you up to?
pediatric surgery.
Yeah, she's a doctor.
Yeah, yeah.
your dad was telling me about Charlie...
the math rock star.
no surprise there, right?
we always figured he'd do something special.
you forgot that big fight you had with your brother when you invited Val to the prom?
come on, Dad, what are you talking about a fight?
he was 13.
he was going to go out with her?
you'll forgive me if my recollection is different from yours.
so, anyway, I hear you two work together now.
Yeah, when I can find him.
not that I don't want to reminisce, but it's why I'm here.
Charlie was in the garage...
no, no, wait, I just saw him go out front.
all right... hey, great seeing you, Val.
you, too.
you're gonna come, right?
Yeah, sure, I wouldn't miss it.
Absolutely. Good.
Congratulations.
thank you... thanks.
so, this is where all those university research dollars go.
everything you see here came out of our own pockets.
Calsci's Mini-Bot "Chain Yank and Crank" is next Friday.
larry: After five years of ignominy, the Physics Department has ascended to the finals against Engineering, thanks to Professor Charles Edward Eppes.
Charlie: I just "free-styled" Faraday's Law of Induction to triple amp the armature coil and maximize horsepower.
this thing's actually going to pull the car?
larry: Hm-mm... six feet to glory.
let's do it.
all right. Guys, there's something else.
this is it.
all right. Okay, ready?
Charlie: There it is. There we go.
you see that? It's moving!
all right, we're there.
three feet... halfway.
come on, baby.
we did it!
sorry, guys.
this is like 1998 all over again.
Hey, did you see Val?
Yeah, yeah.
a doctor.
well, her talents always were in biology.
I take it you both knew this woman?
we were all in the same class in high school.
larry: Oh, yeah.
I keep forgetting you graduated the same year.
so you're not here to talk about Val.
Yeah, right.
you know anything about phosgene gas?
a diluted form of it was released on the subway this morning.
Oh, my God.
we're trying to figure out if it was an accident...
like, maybe a maintenance worker mixing bottles together.
phosgene's used in the manufacture of dyes and pesticides.
it's in the chlorine family and it is highly toxic.
theoretically, it could be accidentally produced by combining certain cleaning agents but that's...
that's very unlikely.
so, it probably wasn't an accident?
Charlie: What was the delivery mechanism?
do you know if it was an air duct or a canister...?
we don't know yet. Why?
because when gas dissipates, it leaves a trail behind.
you may be able to determine the original release point. And if we find that out...
you may find who released it.
Oh, looks like we got something.
the drill participants were all MTA employees or law enforcement.
mta windbreaker's easy enough to get your hands on.
so it looks like the guy dumped this out here in the confusion, and then walked away a new man.
COLBY: Gas mask...
MEGAN: Is that a cafe latte to go?
I love these things.
looks like someone drilled a hole in it and then resealed it.
well, now what?
now, we buy Charlie a coffee.
these coffee drinks... I've seen them.
half my students suck down one per lecture.
don: Let me see it.
how does it work?
the can has an internal heating system.
there's a button on the bottom...
you press it... and water mixes with quicklime.
it's highly exothermic, and it can produce heat as high as 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
and it makes a really nice latte.
and quite an efficient delivery system.
here you go.
kept at 48 degrees, phosgene's a stable liquid.
above that, it turns into a potentially deadly gas.
this diagram illustrates gas intensity levels throughout the subway car, as measured by first-responders.
now, using that data, I was able to run a Gaussian Plume Dispersion Model...
a manner in which to determine the pattern of the gas release.
now, to the naked eye, a gas release can appear as one large cloud.
the gas will spread from its release point driven by air currents to open doors and windows.
obstacles in the path of the gas will affect it's dispersion.
one large cloud is actually comprised of many separate plumes.
using a generalized diffusion equation
I was able to backtrack, to find the origin point of the gas release.
your assailant released the gas here.
precisely in the center of the car.
why right there?
well, this placement allows for the greatest dispersion.
see, this air ducts on the perimeter, there's no way for the gas to vent out.
right. Theoretically it was released in a way to maximize deaths.
remember, you said the phosgene was diluted.
and it was, by mixing in a harmless additive to negate its deadliness.
someone with this type of proficiency...
this wasn't a mistake.
which means this person could have taken lives, but chose not to.
we know he deliberately chose to target and anti-terrorism drill.
so we're talking about a high risk taker, with a thrill-seeking disposition.
right, it's like a game to them.
and most thrill-seekers are adrenaline junkies.
so I'd say our guy's going to strike again.
only this time he'll need to up the ante.
do we really see someone dead this time?
back to the office. Get that memo to the director.
Mr. Houseman, look, I know you're not going to want to hear this,
I don't like having the same conversation twice.
neither do I, but that gas was released
by someone planning to do some serious harm.
and you know this how?
among other things, a mathematical analysis which I stand by.
Really? I've got some math for you.
how about 52 killed in a London subway.
191 in Madrid. Right.
do I really need to mention 9/11?
no, I get your point, and here's mine, okay?
because everything we know tells us whoever did this is going to do it again and the next time the gas is not going to be harmless.
we've got chemical plants that are exposed, we've got harbors.
our food supply, water all very vulnerable to attack.
this city needs these exercises to protect itself.
I understand that, but I'll telling you right now, if we don't stop them I am going on record saying you're making a mistake.
and I think at the very least, we should inform the people that are partaking in these exercises.
and totally corrupt the exercises.
that would accomplish nothing.
look, Agent,.
I've had some experience making tough decisions like these when I oversaw base security as a consultant in Iraq.
the question is, would you rather write two letters of condolence or 200, 000?
Hi, there, gentlemen.
what happened, Larry?
Charlie draft you into another one of those investigations?
you're not going to believe this.
somebody attacked an anti-terrorism drill on the subway.
was anyone hurt?
no, fortunately our budding terrorist utilized a diluted form of phosgene gas.
Hey, Charlie, you know, I could use a hand getting the yard ready for the wedding.
Yeah, Don needs to figure out what happened ASAP.
come on, she was your friend, too.
I guess this is what I get for volunteering, huh?
Yeah, for volunteering my house-- yeah, that's fair.
you provide labor.
I understand Don and Charles went to school with this girl.
Oh, yeah.
your friend Charlie had quite a crush on that girl.
I was 13, and she was my lab partner.
you weren't so casual about it then.
especially when Don took her to the prom. Remember?
they actually had a wrestling match about it on the lawn.
isn't it nice having a living history of embarrassing moments from my childhood.
no, no, no, I'm quite enjoying the vision of a young Charles Eppes moved to violence by a girl.
Oh, he was moved all right.
you know what, can we... can we...
why are talking about this?
this is something that happened...
I have work to... we have work to...
we have to get work done.
Yeah. Well, I guess I have to clip the hedges myself.
how'd it go with Homeland Security?
it didn't.
the drills are going forward.
there are three tomorrow, four the day after that.
well, maybe keeping the exercises in play is good.
it's limiting the number of targets.
what do you mean? There's ten all together.
we don't have troops to cover all of them.
maybe we don't need to. Charlie can probably help us out there.
gentlemen. What do you got?
subway security camera caught our guy on tape.
witness saw him dump his gear in a trash bin.
we ID'd him as a Roger Holstein, 31, ex-army Special Forces.
body art was the tip-off.
that tattoo right there? That means he's a C-T Team operative.
C-T Team?
counter Terror.
they're soldiers trained to role play our enemies and mimic their tactics.
including terrorist simulations.
they test the security at military bases and weapons stations by staging mock attacks.
and the subway strike?
it's right out of their playbook.
this guy Holstein, he's been doing the exact same kind of work as a civilian contractor since he was discharged from the army.
they're last job was two months ago.
his team staged a mock attack on Mirabo Labs
private chemical facility.
what, you think that's where they got the phosgene?
Yeah.
you say these guys usually work together in teams? Always.
can you play back the tape? Yeah.
and stop it right there.
can you zoom in on his ear?
highlight it right there.
whoa.
he's wearing an earpiece.
Holstein wasn't giving orders, he was taking them.
and was this guy in charge of the operation at the chemical plant?
no, it was another ex-army, ex-C-T Team guy.
you got his jacket?
Yeah.
Glen Nash, former Special Forces, served in Iraq, got a medal of valor.
retired from army service in '03.
went into private contracting, mostly overseas.
except for a few jobs in the States at places like Mirabo.
jacket says he has training in psyops, cyber-warfare and covert operations.
what?
in 2002 when he was still in the army, he led a C-T operation that penetrated security at a naval base and stole a submarine.
a submarine?
and he only had seven men in his team.
all right, look, I want his full background.
I want team photos, everything.
I want to know where he is now.
you mean to tell me they could steal a submarine from a naval base with seven guys?
think how easy it would be to attack a wide-open city.
when did you last see your brother, Ms. Nash?
a couple of months ago.
he was in L. A. doing some security work.
I let him crash on my sofa.
in the morning he was gone...
no good-byes.
classic Glen.
any idea where he went?
we're not that close these days.
why is that?
Glen's changed.
you know, he served in Iraq.
Yeah, we looked at his service record.
Glen lost men over there.
that hit him pretty hard.
that'll do that.
you were there?
afghanistan.
then you know.
is my brother in some kind of trouble?
ms. Nash, right now we just need to talk to him.
COLBY: But sooner...
rather than later.
I wish I could help you.
Megan says the only way we're going to stop these guys is to catch them in the act.
you know what? I think she might be right.
well, Charlie, look, I want to stop something terrible from happening.
you know, I don't want to clean up after it.
I understand.
I'll apply Site Percolation Theory.
site Percolation Theory examines how a suspect navigates through a maze of lattice points.
Obstacles-- in order to achieve an objective.
come here.
think of the exercise like a pachinko game.
our attacker is the ball descending through the maze.
and the nails are like physical obstacles
alarm systems, locked doors.
the holes are security traps laid in his path.
now, our guy has to navigate around the obstacles and avoid security in order to reach his objective.
a different pachinko game will yield different lattice points.
just like different exercises will present different security measures.
Absolutely. Now, by analyzing the choices our attacker made that led him to infiltrate the subway,
I may be able to postulate an MO.
however, I'm going to need data from the remaining exercises.
I'll talk to Homeland Security, sure.
great.
Hey, did you hear what Dad's doing?
Oh, my... He's too obsessed with this wedding.
honestly, seriously, he went out and bought himself a copy of Brides magazine.
our little wedding planner.
he says because he has two sons, this may be the only chance he'll have to get to throw a wedding.
it's kind of weird Val getting married at our house, though, don't you think?
Uh-huh. Even weirder, because I liked her and, you know, you took her to the prom.
come on, you're still upset about that?
no, I...
remembering that brings back other stuff.
like what?
like what it was like to be
don Eppes's 13-year-old brainiac brother.
come on, Charlie, don't start.
I mean, it wasn't that big a deal.
not for you, but high school sucked for me, Don.
man, I was a little kid.
everyone was years older than me.
and yeah, there was this one girl who didn't treat me like I was different.
she was nice to me.
it was no easy trick being your brother, either, you know.
you're five years younger than me, we're in the same grade.
I'm like an idiot next to you.
so, I'm sorry if I was better than you at something.
whatever, man. You're the one that asked.
so, predicting how Nash will strike is only half the battle.
it's not going to tell you where.
well, can you tell us that?
no, but Nash will.
I'll tell you what.
let me start by looking at his military operations.
then I think I'll be able to tell you more.
okay.
okay.
we pulled jackets on the rest of Nash's team from the Mirabo Labs job.
now Holstein we know about.
the others are Jason Small, demolition specialist, electronics geek.
all right, well, let's say
Nash has put together a reunion tour and he's targeting the exercises.
that still doesn't tell me why he's going after Homeland Security.
this might.
Nash has been working as a contractor in Iraq this last year, and the base he was
in April they were hit by suicide bombers and he lost two of the men on his team.
david: But how is that connected to Homeland Security, though?
because the same lapses in security that he saw there he sees here now.
my guess is he's decided to call attention to it.
how? By gassing the subway?
in his mind, he's found a way to exert control over a situation he was helpless in.
emotions aren't rational, Grangar.
revenge is just an emotion.
I checked the background.
Nash's CT team fell off the grid after Mirabo;
cell phones, bank statements, credit cards, it all stopped dead.
but wait. He had a sister, right?
who said she doesn't know where he is.
let's get her on surveillance.
I mean, if we don't find him, he's going to find us, you know? Mm-hmm.
Hey. Hey.
master plan is one of the remaining exercises.
thank you very much for your cooperation.
I appreciate it.
I think you should take a look at this first.
our department keeps records of all threats made against Homeland Security personnel or operations.
Nash, he sent letters making a lot of noise about how easy it would be to trash Houseman's anti-terror drills.
I'd appreciate if you don't tell Houseman I gave you that.
Yeah, absolutely.
but why didn't he give it to us?
he doesn't like to respond to what he calls idle threats.
I'm glad you don't agree.
I did my time in the army, first Gulf War.
I've met men like Nash, Special Forces.
my experience?
they don't bark unless they intend to bite.
Oh, a new algorithmic mapping system?
Mm. It's a seating map for the wedding.
my dad finally found me a job I can help him with that's interesting mathematically.
yeah? Well, it seems just a little elaborate.
well, it is a complicated series of evaluations;
dynamic traffic flow, graph analysis, acoustic patterning.
okay. You know, I tell you, none of this explains why I always get stuck sitting between the great aunts and the cigar-smoking cousins.
Oh, diversions aside, this case I'm working on is presenting some difficulties.
anything you hope to discern?
the pattern in Glen Nash's past acts are key to his target selection.
yeah? Anything else going on with you?
it's just the other day, you know, your father recalled the amusing anecdote of you and Don fighting over the girl.
Yeah. What about it?
it's just that, you know, you didn't seem all that amused.
there's some stuff between Don and me that's not worked out.
have you talked to him about that yet?
no. It was high school.
well, you know, sometimes, the path to closure is as elusive as the path from row three to row six.
it's certainly not as simple as it appears.
people always desire to have the best seat in the house, which is the row directly behind the families, but no matter how you map it out, there's always going to be some seats some targets...
harder to get to than others.
that's the commonality.
out of 30 CT team operations, all were against mility bases and high security labs.
but I know that in the military,
ct teams often choose their own assignments.
it seems like Glen Nash made a point of choosing the most unassailable targets.
well, there's your pattern.
Megan, we ran an employment check on Nash's former team.
prior to Mirabo Labs,
holstein, Small and Olerud all worked jobs in construction, home-building supply and electronics wholesale.
that doesn't track.
cowboys like this don't take ten-dollar-an-hour McJobs.
these Special Forces guys are trained to live off the land and make use of what's readily available.
like turning a convenience store item like a cafe latte can into a chemical bomb.
we figure maybe these guys helped themselves to some phosgene gas when they were working at the labs.
could be they chose the other worksites for whatever else they needed to steal.
we should talk to their former employers, see what else went missing. Hey, where's Don?
he's with the Homeland Security guys in the conference room.
great, 'cause I think I may have an answer for them.
after the first World Trade Center attack in 1993, mathematicians at the NSA tried to predict other attacks by evaluating likely target choices using a linear discriminant analysis.
agent Eppes, am I here for a math lecture or a substantive discussion of the problem at hand?
well, how about both, Mr. Houseman?
based on past acts,
I've deduced that Glen Nash doesn't just prefer hard targets, he goes for the hardest.
the greatest security challenges.
given this fact,
I've applied my Linear Discrminant Analysis to the ten remaining exercises.
and I've calculated threat assessments based on a series of variables:
number of ingresses, egresses, number of security cameras, police presence, proximity to the freeway and so on.
now, from these variables,
I've rated the targets from softest to hardest, and I believe that Nash's next target is City Hall.
we have an exercise there tomorrow, 9: 00 A. M.
so that gives us, what, like, 11 hours.
well, that's enough time to run Nash's MO through my Psych Percolation Theory Algorithm and that may tell us how he'll attack.
we have a breach at the Homeland Security office.
TERRY: It doesn't make any sense.
the Homeland Security office isn't a hard target, and to strike two days before a scheduled exercise breaks Nash's MO.
maybe he's telling us we're on his schedule now.
nothing was missing.
security says no.
is it possible they're trying to download plans for the exercises and trigger the alarm that way?
tech guys say the firewall hasn't been breached.
I want every inch of this building searched again.
no one has entered, Peter.
every inch, James.
and your guys didn't get anything off of these video cameras?
or the motion detectors.
so nobody actually made entry.
but they want us to believe they did.
why would Nash want to trigger an alarm if his team never entered?
it's not a game if there's no objective, right?
right.
so tripping the alarm accomplished what?
well, it brought us all here.
Nash is trained in cyberwarfare.
he hacked into their system, right?
but why? What's the point?
what if we're the point?
if he can hack into their security system, why couldn't he hack into their video surveillance?
they're both on the same circuit.
TERRY: So he's watching us through those cameras.
okay, he's watching us do what?
he's watching us respond.
UnControl?
but why not just steal Houseman's security plans for the rest of the exercises?
because then Houseman might cancel them.
our boy Nash wants to make sure those exercises stay in play.
as a target. Uh-huh.
okay, thank you.
Hey, I just checked those other jobs that Nash's guys had.
you were exactly right.
there's a bunch of stuff missing.
blasting caps from a construction site, a pesticide called Cordex missing from a home supply store.
a bunch of cell phones from the electronics shop.
palestinian suicide terrorists, they use Cordex to mix with explosives.
plus blasting caps and cell phones.
Nash is making a bomb.
don: We're talking about concrete evidence that Nash and his men have an explosive device.
TERRY: Any my psych workups indicate that he's getting tired of sending you messages you don't listen to.
if we stop the exercise, we're giving him what he wants.
and you don't and you are literally daring him to cause real casualties.
I think we should listen to what they say, Peter.
all right. We postpone the exercises until you get Nash.
tell our people to stand down.
that went a lot easier than I thought it would.
you don't think a bomb going off is enough of a motivator?
what part of his personality says he can take a suggestion?
okay, well, what's changed since the last time we saw him?
the break-in at Homeland Security.
he seemed pretty rattled.
which we assumed was because Nash hit him where he lived.
think something else scared him?
maybe.
Hey.
Hey, brother.
what's up? Dad's lasagna.
it's actually worth digesting.
why don't you grab a plate?
I'm good, thanks.
are you sure? Yeah.
what do you got there?
what is it, high school yearbook? No way.
Yeah.
I don't remember you being next to Val.
Yeah, Val Eng, Charlie Eppes.
I thought it was part of a greater plan.
what? I ruined that?
what's your quote here?
eternal nothingness is okay if you dress for it.
Oh, yeah, Woody Allen. That's good.
I don't remember you being all that funny.
Oh, and yeah, you were hilarious, right?
man, I totally didn't get you.
we totally didn't get each other, did we?
no, negative.
we could have never done this work together as kids.
no way.
both: Can you imagine that?
we're doing all right now, right?
somehow, yeah. We're doing all right.
Charlie, look, you know, if I did stuff that hurt you when we were kids,
I'm sorry.
thank you. You don't have to...
I was 13.
Yeah, exactly. You were 13.
she was, she was so hot.
she's still hot, man.
and just think how happy Dad would be if one of us married a doctor.
I think he'd be happy if I married someone with a pulse.
nice point.
Hey, listen, so something Larry said got me thinking about the targets.
Yeah, it doesn't matter 'cause they canceled the exercises.
we're going to have to catch Nash the hard way.
that's just it.
I'm not so sure the exercises were the target.
what do you mean?
come on, bro, I'll show you.
so I based my Linear Discriminant Analysis on Nash's past operations which yielded a preference for hard targets:
missile silos and battle command labs.
right. Which is why you thought he'd strike City Hall.
but in focusing on Nash's patterns of behavior,
I overlooked something.
the subway, the office of Homeland Security, those are soft targets.
which don't fit his MO.
so we've either been looking at the wrong guy, or the wrong targets.
Hey. Hey.
TERRY: Morning.
good morning.
tape from the Homeland Security office.
Yeah, I'm trying to see what Nash was seeing.
he's watching us.
right. That's us, but watch Houseman.
he's checking out his laptop.
don: Look at his face.
Yeah, okay.
I see the eyes, the jaw, the tension.
something on that screen scared him.
don: What if Nash wasn't just hacking into their security system.
what if he was hacking into Houseman's computer?
so he wasn't watching us, he's watching Houseman.
whatever message he sent was received loud and clear.
wait, back up.
a little more resolution. Yeah.
Oh, "K-I-A." That's "killed in action."
he's talking about the American troops killed in Iraq.
all right, call Homeland Security.
get a bomb squad over there.
tell Houseman he's going into protective custody, and that's willingly or unwillingly.
see, Charlie thought the exercises weren't Nash's prime target.
so he's going after Houseman, not the drills.
houseman didn't show up for work this morning.
they've been trying to find him all day.
surveillance just saw Nash go into his sister's house.
all right, let's get over there.
MEGAN: There is our guy.
all right, we go on my command.
just hold it.
Nash's sister.
all right, you two deal with her.
let's go, let's go, let's go.
ms. Nash. Ms. Nash.
arms in the air!
who called 911?
get your hands up. Get them up!
all right, just stay cool, partner
everything's gonna be all right.
one more step, I'm gonna put a hole right through you!
step away from the door, step away from the door.
get down on your knees.
down on your knees!
hands on your head.
check it out.
get them on your head!
most people use a pot rack to hang pots.
Where's Houseman?
who?
Where's the bomb?
you're sure asking a lot of questions for someone who's trying to make me think you got all the answers.
look, pal, you don't want to mess with me.
it's over. I'm your only hope.
it's never over, Agent, not until the last man standing.
hate to pee in your corn flakes, but I don't know where Houseman is.
I got nothing to do with this.
you had nothing to do with threats against the exercises?
freedom of speech.
I spent my adult life defending the Constitution,
I figure I'm entitled to use an amendment or two.
Hey, come on, don't cloak this in the Constitution.
this is about your men dying in Iraq, isn't it?
we pulled background checks on the Homeland
security personnel.
you know that Houseman did a consulting gig in Iraq before he worked for the department.
it was his team who drew up the security plans for the airbase where your team members were killed.
made a lot of money doing it, too.
don: You sent a letter to the Pentagon-- they didn't listen.
boy, I'll bet that pissed you off, huh?
so you found another way to be heard?
did you ask your team to steal phosgene gas from Mirabo Labs?
the same gas that was used in the subway.
Hey, if that happened, it wasn't under my order.
Oh, all of a sudden you weren't in charge.
now, why do I have a hard time believing that?
after the Mirabo job, we all went our separate ways.
I want to know where they are, I want to know where the bomb is and I want to know where
houseman is, and that's your only shot at a deal, you hear me?
if I were in charge of this operation, we wouldn't even be having this discussion because there's no way in hell a bunch of Feds would've ever caught me, pants down, at my sister's house.
I'm not that stupid.
we just talked to Nash's sister.
he hasn't even been in the country for the last four weeks.
where was he?
he's been in Mexico in drug rehab.
I guess after what happened in Iraq, he started using.
the rehab clinic confirmed
Nash has been there this entire month.
Yeah. Iraq messed him up, just not the way we thought.
all right, so if not him, then who, and, and why are they after Houseman?
this Army file may have our answer.
I just got to thinking, who served Nash up to us as a suspect on a silver platter?
Houseman's number two. Eppes.
Nash isn't the only ex-Army guy who lost men. Great.
different Iraq war, same story.
on our way.
houseman was just spotted.
where?
homeland Security with James Grace.
you sure Security's right?
there's no good reason for Grace to be on the roof.
okay, guys, I got him.
grace, get your hands up.
I don't think so.
get them up where I can see them!
I wouldn't get any closer if I were you.
I got him on speed-dial.
all right, we're going to need a bomb squad and we gotta set up a perimeter.
aren't we in it?
we need a perimeter around the building.
there's a bomb on the roof.
we've pulled your file,
major Grace.
you were Special Forces yourself. Like Nash.
him and his team served under you.
all those men were great men.
is that how you're gonna make your point?
you're gonna blow up a bunch of FBI agents?
there's only one person here that deserves a body bag-- him.
James, what the hell did I ever do to you?
to me?
nothing, but those men in Iraq...
you let them think they were secure...
and you're doing the same thing now, here.
I'm just trying to protect lives, the same as you.
how? By staging these drills?
everything's pre-planned, guaranteed for success?
you want a real exercise, Peter?
one with real risk?
you got one, right now.
that's what this is, isn't it, Major?
an exercise.
I want him to feel what those men felt in Iraq...
for real.
then you've accomplished your mission.
let him go.
that bomb's not real, is it?
you think I would dishonor the men that fight for this country by killing a defenseless man like him?
all right, relax.
we're coming in. What?
Yeah, feel it, Peter. Feel it.
like I said...
it was just an exercise.
Yeah, I hope it was it worth it.
if it gets the message through to people like him?
Absolutely.
can I just adjust your tie?
you're acting like I'm getting married.
boys.
how do you like the flowers, hmm?
it's great, yeah.
I was thinking of getting potted kumquats, but, uh...
dad, whatever you did, the place looks beautiful.
don: Absolutely. Good job.
Charlie: You throw a great, wedding.
remember that, both of you.
Oh, here we go.
Mr. Eppes?
I just wanted to thank you.
no, it's Alan, and you look absolutely lovely.
thank you. Huh?
well, now...
it's a beautiful bride.
so where's the groom?
uh... oh, Ben's over there.
I better go back inside before he sees me. Catch up with you after?
Hey, congratulations.
Yeah.
thank you.
he's a doctor, too.
so am I, Dad.
that's what I meant.
are you Charlie Eppes?
sure, why not?
I'm Bree.
you're Val's cousin.
right. Wow, you were so... so little.
I'm not so little anymore.
I was looking for an escort.
uh... Sorry. Groom side.
lead on.
okay.
well.
don: He's got to close, though.
that kid's gotta learn how to close.
Yeah, that's what he needs, a seminar from the dateless wonder.
I don't see you with a date, pal.
who says I don't have a date?
the caterer?
Yes, the caterer. Nice.
she has a daughter, too.
she's very cute.
I can take care of myself.
take a look. There she is.
Oh, that's her daughter?
Yes.
Oh... See, that's food for thought.
just now. Thought I'd watch to the end of the game.
where you going?
he's going on a date.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
you know that girl -donna, -Yeah.
from val's wedding?
you know the, uh, caterer? -Mm-hmm.
Yeah, her.
Oh, hey, listen, I wanted to ask you guys something.
uh, it's her birthday coming up, and I wanted to get her a gift.
you know, something...
I don't know, I just...
don't know what.
it's just a question of what you want to say.
well, how about, "happy birthday?
you know, two mathematicians from university college in London actually recently addressed this very same question.
mathematicians?
english mathematicians?
they used game theory to analyze the best characteristics of a courtship gift.
Yeah. Well, no offense, Charlie.
it sounds to me like two math geeks who don't date much.
I do take offense.
Yeah, all right, shut up.
so, keep going.
well, assuming that the goal is the female's receptiveness...
Yes.
they found that an extravagant gift, one that's costly to the man, but of no real financial value to the woman, offers the best chance of success.
so, why don't you buy her some flowers?
you know what?
take her to dinner in a fancy restaurant.
okay, that's doable.
see? You guys still doubt the power of math?
Yeah, well, when it comes to female receptiveness, yes.
huh.
right. On my way.
what is that?
shooting. Got to go.
Hey, have fun with, uh...
right.
Thanks, guys.
appreciate it.
Hey, what's going on?
looks like a drive-by.
what, are you kidding me? Why'd they bring us in?
just got down here myself.
cops on the scene say they were told to sit tight and wait.
for what? -For me.
lieutenant gary walker, lapd, gang impact team.
Hey. Don Eppes, FBI...
no badges. U. S. Attorney doesn't want the locals to know FBI is on the scene.
Oh, yeah? And why is that?
well, apparently, they don't want anyone to blow his cover.
though personally, I think it's a little late.
but I'm not calling the shots.
his name is Anton Rhimes.
worked an extortion case together down in long beach.
don, he's FBI.
agent Rhimes was part of a multi-agency task force.
he'd been working undercover for ten months.
as a gang member?
Yeah. He'd infiltrated the 23rd street syndicate, and was providing information regarding their leadership.
so, they took him out?
that'd be my guess.
you find any casings?
no, but that's not unusual.
they tend to stay in the car in a drive-by.
all right, I'm gonna talk to the U. S. Attorney.
meanwhile, you guys should just keep taking care of the evidence, all right?
Yeah.
restaurant was pretty busy all day.
you couldn't pull a single witness?
well, it's kind of the way it is with these people, agent.
it's kind of us versus them out there.
I meant lawmen versus civilians.
right.
I know what we're waiting on.
an undercover FBI agent gets whacked.
we all know what happened.
23rd street bangers found out his identity and had him killed.
in my opinion, we ought to hit them back hard for it.
the longer a thing like this goes unanswered, the more dangerous it gets for all of us out there.
I appreciate your sense of outrage, lieutenant, but we need to confirm that agent Rhimes' cover really was blown before we make a move.
you guys, this is robin brooks.
she's the assistant U. S. Attorney running the task force that Rhimes was on.
what I was suggesting was that we grab as many of these 23rd street bangers as we can for questioning.
which would be as good as telling them that Rhimes was a federal agent.
look, counselor, let's not forget.
we have a man down.
where I come from, that means something.
look, the 23rd street syndicate is responsible for dozens of homicides, extortion, drug trafficking.
I'm sorry, but I am not about to blow a 14-month investigation to make you feel better.
let's just take a breath here, okay?
I mean, an agent did give his life for this case.
but...I agree There's no point jeopardizing what he was working on until we absolutely have to, right?
let me see what you got.
like a lot of gangs, 23rd street's branching out.
they've set up shop in over nine states.
we've had to turn to federal racketeering provisions to stop them.
so you're building a Rico case?
same way we've gone after traditional organized crime.
take down the leadership.
it was agent Rhimes' job to identify the "shot callers
within the 23rd street syndicate.
this is a map of local gang territories.
none of the boundaries are exact, as they vary as bordering gangs battle.
they're random and unpredictable.
actually, they're-they're neither.
economists have several math models that we can apply to analyze how gangs partition territory.
now, one of them was actually originally designed to predict plant growth.
in situations of dense population, plants struggle against each other.
they fight to obtain sunlight, to establish dominance...
and it turns out, that the same equations designed to predict plant growth apply themselves remarkably well to borders between rival human populations, as well.
wh-wh-what are these flags?
these are gang-related shootings.
now, over what time frame?
how many years?
years? -Mm-hmm.
this is just six months.
six... six months?
there's almost...
there's almost 100 shootings.
and those are only the shootings that are related to the 23rd street syndicate.
you want total gang shootings, we're talking more like 1, 000.
I'm sorry. In six months?
Yeah.
Wow. Well, I'm assuming the Lapd hasn't analyzed this with a regression tree or run it through a Poisson clumping analysis.
well, considering that I have no idea what that means, I'm gonna say no.
he's a mathematician. You know, they have their own language.
Charlie, what, do you see something here?
there is a lot of information here, and I'm already detecting a pattern. Now, if I could just get all files on the shootings,
I might be able to tell you if agent Rhimes' murder was part of a pattern, or an anomaly.
don, we have the video surveillance from the restaurant.
all right.
all right, so that's Rhimes on the right, but who's that?
that's Travis Watts.
he's high up in the 23rd street structure.
he's a suspected shot caller.
well, it looks to me like he took Rhimes out for a last supper, set him up for execution.
I... I don't know.
what about a warrant sweep?
I mean, you do it all the time.
we could play it low-profile, you know?
so, we run down 23rd street members on open warrants, use that leverage to find watts.
that way, no one knows about agent Rhimes' cover.
okay.
Oh, this garage.
do you have any idea how many deadly forms of mold live out here?
do you have any idea how many gang-related shootings there were in los angeles in the past four years?
obviously, I don't have that exact figure, but something tells me you do.
well, take a guess.
just go ahead-- all shootings, non-fatal and fatal.
go ahead, take a guess. -How many?
okay. Over the last four years?
I don't know. Let's say a thousand.
almost 8, 000.
Really? -Yeah.
2, 000 of those resulted in deaths, and most of them occurred ten or 12 miles from here.
gee, those numbers are overwhelming.
they are. There's a lot of data here, Larry, but the police know who the players are.
and if I can just find the key attributes to connect one crime to another,
I can write an algorithm to connect the shootings to the gang members involved.
but Charlie, these issues-- they're just so complicated.
and you know, I mean, what you're describing-- that seems like a lot to ask, even for Don.
well, Don did only ask for help with this one case, but, uh, Don't all these other victims deserve justice?
guys.
game over.
take it back, man.
we'll let you get winners.
Nah, that ain't gonna work, bro. We got now.
I need you all to get down on the ground.
you
hit the ground.
come on.
you know the drill.
I got him! Hey!
get back here!
Hey! Stop...!
Hey, you, stop, you.
stop right there.
stop... hands up.
turn around.
hands up.
hands on your head.
what the hell's going on?
I said, what the hell's going on?
ma'am, I've got everything under control, okay?
you've got what under control?
ma'am, everything is fine.
I'm just doing my job.
do you have a warrant?
excuse me?
I'm the director of this community center, and I'm responsible for what happens in this building.
no, I don't have a warrant, and I don't need one to pursue a suspect.
John, take the kids back in the room.
come on, guys, let's go.
this doesn't have anything to do with us. Come on.
are you all right?
uh, he ran after me.
I ain't do nothing.
he was told to stop, and he ran.
well, maybe the gun had something to do with it.
kids come here to get away from violence.
you need some help?
everything's under control, lieutenant.
ma'am, I have a job to do, and you need to let me do it.
everything's fine.
you see what I'm talking about, about the lack of cooperation.
so, guess what.
Anthony here has got not one, but two outstanding warrants.
isn't that right, Anthony?
if you say so, man.
Yeah, man, I say so.
only good news is, today we might give you a chance to change your luck.
how is that?
we're looking for a friend of yours;
somebody you might roll with:
Anthony, you help us, maybe we worry about these warrants another day.
what's it gonna be, Anthony?
where were you the night before last, Travis?
I don't know. A lot of places.
I get around. You know how it is.
this is you and Anton Rhimes at 6: 20.
only at 6: 45, Anton's dead.
Yeah. So, I was with him.
and not when he got shot.
I went back for my cell phone.
that's kind of lucky for you.
why are you asking me all these questions anyway?
you were there when he was murdered, right?
and what happened to him will be dealt with.
what's dealt with?
I'm not saying anything that would incriminate me.
but right about now, some shaved heads in Hoover park are getting a message.
so, 23rd street's retaliating.
take one of mine,
I'm gonna take five of yours.
if 23rd street really is retaliating, there's no way they knew Rhimes is FBI.
just got off the phone with walker.
a gang unit in Hoover park just confirmed three separate drive-by shootings.
23rd street's suspected.
so, Rhimes' cover was still intact?
but if his cover wasn't blown, why the hell was he killed?
if Rhimes' cover wasn't blown...
then on the street, he was just another gang member.
what got him killed then?
turf dispute? Wrong tattoos?
23rd street retaliated against Hoover park because they think that they killed Rhimes.
these two gangs have been going at each other hard, ever since 23rd street ripped off a drug shipment from Hoover park's supplier.
Yeah, but your guys keep track of all gang rivalries, right?
an enemies list.
every time a name comes up in a beef with a rival gangbanger, we write it down.
I'd like to take a look at those field reports, see if Rhimes was targeted for being 23rd street or it was personal or...
you know maybe we should look into the personal side.
maybe he had a concern that he didn't tell the prosecutor, but maybe he told his wife.
definitely worth checking out.
don, Charlie's here.
he's got something to show you.
now what you're seeing is a behavioral sequence analysis.
it's a sequential representation of shootings over the past four years.
and what does it get us?
well, this kind of dynamic graph is an amazingly good predictor of what I've been calling shooting chains.
shooting chains?
shootings that are linked.
one to the next, then to the next.
you mean retaliation shootings.
we already know about all those.
well, what I'm saying is that it might be possible to follow these shooting chains back to the original shooter.
without witnesses and without testimony?
visualize a tabletop covered with dominos.
the first domino to fall is the start of a shooting chain.
shooting chains can be short, shooting chains can be long.
some shooting chains initiate other branching chains.
now we're looking at these shooting chains after the fact, after all the dominos have fallen.
and reconstructing these chains is going to be difficult.
but there is a way.
by using hierarchical network graphs in combination with Poisson clumping, we can work our way backwards, back to the original dominos that started the chain.
which means we could identify the inciters
gang members most prone to violence.
that's correct.
and if we could somehow remove them from the loop...
theoretically, we stop future shootings.
you got it. That's it.
well, that's an interesting notion.
interesting, yet you don't seem interested.
well, it's a matter of priorities.
18 percent of these shootings killed or injured innocent bystanders.
I think some of those people were ten years old.
35 percent of the victims were 16 years old or younger.
Yeah, I know.
I'm at those crime scenes, and I don't like it.
but no matter how many gangbangers we pull in, more are gonna come to take their place.
and frankly, to most people, stopping bad guys from killing bad guys isn't a major priority.
Yeah, again, some of these shootings involve innocent people.
all right, Charlie, hey... -that's fine.
excuse me. That's fine.
you know, you'll just have to forgive me if I feel that citywide gang violence isn't something that one mathematician can stop.
I'm gonna have to run.
brief the next team.
I'll talk to you later, all right? Look, hey...hey, I'm not here to start trouble with anyone.
listen, listen, all right?
let's just concentrate on Rhimes for now, okay?
you got to give the guy a break. He's been at this for, you know, over 20 years now.
we were planning a family.
it was gonna happen right after Anton's undercover
I'm really sorry.
it's funny, you know, he hasn't been home all that much these last few months, so...
not having him around, it really hasn't hit me yet.
I was hoping I could ask you a couple of questions.
sure.
has your husband mentioned being afraid of anyone or anything in the last couple of weeks?
Anton afraid?
he didn't have the gene.
I'm the one who did the worrying.
so he never mentioned anyone.
we didn't talk very much lately.
like I said, he hasn't been around.
I'm in my last year of architecture school, and there just never seemed to be enough time.
I understand.
but I could tell he was excited.
you know, he'd get that way whenever he was getting close.
I think the people he was after were starting to trust him, starting to let him make decisions.
I can't even give him the funeral he deserves.
can't even bury him with honor, because they still don't want to blow his cover.
it's quite a job you have.
this is another FBI project, judging from the references to firearm violence.
Yeah, well, an FBI agent was killed.
I'm trying to identify possible motives.
by identifying all the links and patterns, is that it?
so many of these murders are connected that I'm having trouble seeing past the initial relationships.
looks like they're chain reactions.
I'm calling them shooting chains.
you're trying to solve all the shooting chains, is that right? Not just one.
uh, yeah. Maybe.
Oh, Charles, consider Galileo.
now he was interested in a single specific problem
getting a closer look at the planets.
so he built the most powerful telescope of his time.
that's right, and he saw the moons of Jupiter, thus proving that not everything in the universe revolved around the earth.
the point, Fleinhardt, the point.
the point, Mr. Eppes, is that formulating a grand theory is often best done by focusing on a single, small question.
why did you print out all these photos?
I don't know.
I was looking at the ages of the victims, and I wanted to see their faces.
all right, Eric. -Bye, Damian.
all right, David let me give you a hand there.
Thanks.
you're the one that was chasing that kid earlier.
that's right.
who are you after now?
I'm not after anyone.
don't get me wrong, those that run need chasing.
it's the kids I worry about.
they can still be saved.
nice to meet you.
the lady I was talking to earlier...
she still around?
Olivia's always around.
she's probably inside.
Thanks.
hope you didn't come by to make more trouble.
no, I just wanted to ask you a few questions, that's all.
about Anthony?
no, we cut Anthony loose.
turns out he really didn't do anything.
at least you admit when you make a mistake.
there was a murder down here the other night.
been a bunch of murders down here.
this one had a few witnesses though.
I thought maybe you could help me get someone to come forward, give us some more info.
help you?
wait a minute.
just hold on for a second.
you have a problem with trying to solve a murder?
people get shot around here every day.
never much effort finding witnesses.
it just makes me wonder, why all the interest now?
who was it that got shot?
look, whatever you think about me, okay, about the police, people around here seem to listen to you.
and I am asking for your help.
you mean you're asking me to trust you.
Yeah. I guess I am.
and I'm supposed to do that because you have a badge?
I'm sorry.
you haven't been down here enough for me to trust you.
a man lost his life.
I'm not here to restore your faith in the system.
I am just trying to find his killer.
if you think you want to help with that, call me.
dad. -What's going on?
not much.
things are just not coming together on this one.
Yeah, I know.
I saw some of what Charlie's been working on.
he's looking at every gang shooting for the last four years, which is a lot.
well, he follows the numbers.
the more something seems unsolvable, the more he wants to solve it.
well, he's wasting time.
he's looking at way too much.
look, I don't think he expects to solve something that's been going on that long.
I mean, with decades of bad urban planning, racism and economic blight, gang violence doesn't go away overnight.
it's just that it's Charlie, you know?
he has to get to understand the entire picture.
Hey. Don, hey.
I got news for you.
yeah? On Rhimes or the 4, 000 other shootings?
both.
I was able to discover a pattern.
nine shootings, all of them connected, right?
with agent Rhimes, you've got ten.
connected, as in all part of the same chain?
no. Each one of the ten is the start of its own shooting chain.
and Don, I think they're all the work of the same killer.
so you're saying Rhimes' killer is responsible for ten murders?
no, far more.
I mean, he may have pulled the trigger on those ten murders, but they aren't his only victims.
right, because of all the retaliation shootings, you mean.
right. When you include all the victims from these ten shooting chains, you've got yourself one person setting off over 60 murders.
Hey, guys, listen up.
I got nine separate gang shootings over the last two years, Charlie thinks they are all related to Rhimes' murder.
related how?
all the same shooter.
the same shooter? -That's right.
ten kills?
I don't care how hard-core a gangbanger we're talking about, this guy would be a legend.
he's right.
Plus, the shootings are spread throughout completely different gang territories, exploiting totally different rivalries.
trust me, if Charlie's math says they're connected, the odds are they are connected, okay?
I have three different files here.
all three victims are different races.
they also all have a different weapon.
25 cal.-- What's this, 44...
that's a nine millimeter.
Yeah, same here. They're all different.
that's why we need to look at this stuff fresh, right?
we need to run the prints again, the ballistics, anything we can, okay?
hold on a second.
you see something?
all three of these
four, if you count Rhimes
are single homicides;
the victim is isolated.
Yeah, this one is, too. How about these?
same.
Yeah, here, too.
Yeah, this one as well.
so?
so, that doesn't happen by accident.
it might just be something about opportunity, or it might be part of a bigger plan.
but either way, it supports Charlie's theory that there's a single killer with a specific method of finding his victims.
all right, let's check into this; let's go.
professor Fleinhardt.
Oh, agent reeves.
Hey, Amita. -Hi.
Hey.
wow, you have a lot of victim photos.
lot of victims.
Charlie, Don told me your theory, and, assuming you're right,
I'm trying to figure out how the killer is finding his victims.
and I don't have a behavioral model yet, but it seems that it has to be more than just opportunity.
and I can tell you mathematically, yeah, it has to be.
what does that mean? Why?
each of the murders started an exceptionally long shooting chain.
now, the average for a shooing chain is about 2. 8 shootings, right?
well, these are all much higher.
look-- four, five, six, seven shootings, even.
statistically, that wouldn't happen if he had chosen the victims at random.
the chains would have conformed to the overall average.
so, there is definitely a method to how he's choosing his victims.
in other words, the killer's choosing his victims specifically to maximize retaliation.
so he's trying to take out as many gang members as possible.
but wouldn't that also endanger members of his own gang?
I mean, they're surely going to be the target of the retaliation.
you see, now you're making this rather large assumption.
I mean, how do we know that the shooter is a gang member?
a serial killer?
targeting gang members for the same reason other serial killers target prostitutes.
because nobody really cares about the victims.
exactly. And then they can go on killing for longer without anyone noticing.
I mean, this guy's been out there for like two years.
and if he hadn't killed Rhimes, we still wouldn't know who he is.
Charlie says he's been maximizing retaliations.
he'd have to know a lot about gangs.
I mean, about their structure, how they function.
you're right, that's how he knows who to go after.
all right, yeah.
Yeah, I got you.
that was ballistics.
one of the slugs we've been testing hit on the computer.
turns out the same gun that fired it was used in a liquor store robbery-homicide.
well, let's run down the guy who owns the gun--find our shooter.
the problem is, this gun's not even supposed to exist anymore.
what does that mean?
it was turned in to one of those buy-back programs three years ago--turn in your gun, get a free gift at christmastime.
and those guns are supposed to be destroyed?
Yeah, they're supposed to be, but obviously this one wasn't.
you got this? Thank you.
Yep, got it.
yo, Hoover park!
this is part of the shooting chain related to Anton Rhimes' murder.
23rd street retaliated against Hoover park this afternoon.
tonight, Hoover park strikes back.
it's probably not over, either.
no.
Ah, man, that's Anthony, huh?
been better off if you'd locked him up.
Hey, David, let me talk to you for a second.
did some checking into that gun, the one that went missing -from the buy-back program. -Yeah...
dug up some paperwork.
take a look at this.
the signature on the bottom of that receipt.
lieutenant Gary Walker.
could be completely innocent, but at some point or another, the gun that killed Rhimes passed through walker's hands.
I don't think I like what you're suggesting.
well, it's not a question of whether you like it, because your name is on the form, right?
that's your name, it's not a forgery, so the investigation brings us to you; I'm sorry.
my name's on about a thousand forms.
I've been working the buy-back program in my division for six years.
collecting weapons that were supposed to be melted down.
you know how many guns we take in off the street?
how many lives we save because of it?
then why don't you tell me how a gun that you signed for ends up back on the street in the hands of a killer.
who the hell knows;
security's not perfect at these things, a lot of people come through here.
now, we probably took 50 guns off the street that day.
if one of them slipped through, got back out, that's still 49 others that we took in.
I don't care about them, because they're not in the hands of a murderer.
Oh come on, Eppes, we're talking about a motivated individual out there killing.
if it hadn't been this gun, it'd been another one, and you and I both know that.
all right... -Don? Excuse me.
the guys upstairs ran a full audit.
more than a dozen guns from the buy-back program never made it to the furnace.
okay, then, just tell me how the program works.
what is the exact chain of possession?
there's usually maybe five or six drop-off locations:
churches, community centers...
community centers?
is there any way to check each weapon against the location it was turned in to?
well, just by the responsible police officer's signatures.
and, it turns out, all these guns were signed for by you, lieutenant.
which means they were all turned in at the same location.
right.
which is the 23rd street community center.
you do see the obscene irony here,
we're one of the few places in the neighborhood that's really trying to do some good, and you're coming down on us.
ms. Rawlings, I am not coming down on you.
the gun buy-back is a good program.
that may be, but we still need to see those records.
we need to know everyone who was working here the day the guns were collected.
these are people who try to help out.
people who contribute.
do you have any idea how hard it's going to be to get volunteers if they can't lend a hand here without getting a visit from the FBI?
ms. Rawlings, I want those names and addresses.
anyone who had access to those guns.
I know you do background checks.
what if I won't give them to you?
we can get a court order and make this public.
and, I suppose, the community center could find itself liable to the victims' families if it came to that.
I hope you're really proud of yourself.
you're doing a whole lot to give back to this community.
ten people had the opportunity to get their hands on the guns that were turned in at the 23rd street community center.
those are the background checks they ran.
well, we can probably rule out the priest, huh?
these six here strike me as possibilities.
they could have the necessary gang knowledge, and the ability to pull something like this off.
all right, so we just need to find a way to connect one of them to the victims.
specifically, the first victim.
because with serial killers, the first victim almost always has significance.
it's the first kill.
it's a really big step.
means it's personal, or someone close, accessible.
so, victim number one is where we're looking to find our link.
this is Omar Brice.
he was shot outside of a party two years ago.
all right.
well, I'll take the family.
you want to pull his record, talk to his P. O?
I'll see what walker's gang unit has on him.
has to be a link between him and one of our suspects.
Hey.
are you still working?
Yeah, I just needed a break.
Where's dad?
he's upstairs.
he just got home from his date with, um... Donna.
Oh, yeah?
so? How'd it go?
fine.
the date went fine.
yeah?
What'd you end up getting her?
well, according to those london mathematicians, you should have sprung for the very expensive dinner, dad.
Nah, I disagree.
I think women want something that'll last.
something they can remember the night by, at least.
that would be ideal.
I'm afraid to ask.
what did you get her?
soap.
soap.
very expensive soap.
yeah?
how'd that go over?
well, uh...
honestly speaking, she wasn't wowed.
I mean, she was very polite about it, but she, uh, wasn't, uh... wowed.
ruined the whole date, didn't it?
it didn't ruin the date.
the date was fine.
you're home at 9: 30.
I didn't say it couldn't have been better.
you look exhausted, you know that?
I'm just killing myself trying to find a link between our suspects and his first victim.
well, at least you have suspects.
Hey, Don, why are you...
why are you looking to link your suspects to the first victim?
because when it comes to serial murders, there's always significance to the first victim.
well, I understand that, but what I mean is why aren't you looking at the whole first chain?
what do you mean?
now, remember I compared the shooting chains to dominos?
right?
okay. So, let's say
I'm the killer, and I have reason to want this gang member killed.
we'll call him "Bob.
now, I could just shoot Bob myself.
the smarter move:
assuming I know the gang structure well enough...
instead of shooting Bob,
I shoot Tim,
knowing that shooting Tim will set off a chain that ultimately results...
in the shooting of my real target, Bob.
that is smart.
you're never involved in the shooting of Bob.
so, since you don't have a motive for killing Tim, then you're not a suspect there, either.
check the whole first chain, your target's going to be in there.
Charlie, thanks.
what are we working on?
first shooting chain.
we only looked at the first link, Omar Brice.
but what if Brice wasn't the real target?
what if the real target was someone further down the chain?
that makes sense.
at the time of Brice's murder, Lapd focused on three suspects.
they're all Hoover park gang members.
they had all made threats against Brice.
Jesse Orosco, and Peter Mendez.
I have the murder file on Orosco and Jesse right here.
he was gunned down one week after the Brice slaying.
so Orosco was victim number two in the shooting chain.
Yeah.
wait a minute.
Where's the file on the community center volunteers?
it's right over here.
Why? What do you got?
this kid, Orosco, at the time ofhis murder, he was a suspect in another drive-by
one that killed a 15-year-old kid named Brian Owens.
kid's father John works at the community center.
Really?
he was present at all the gun buy-backs.
so this guy's son gets shot in a drive-by.
he sets off a shooting chain that ends up killing the gangbanger that's responsible.
only the killing didn't stop there.
spotter says Owens is inside alone.
I tried calling, but he's not picking up.
the dude's armed for sure.
talked to one of his neighbors.
says he sees him out on his porch at night with a rifle.
he's pretty sure it's an AK.
plus all the guns he got from the buy-back program.
what we need is to lure him near a window, give one of my snipers a clean shot.
shoot first, ask questions later, right?
lives are in danger here, agent Sinclair--lives of the people who live here.
don, I met this guy.
let me see if i can talk to him.
just give me a shot.
maybe it doesn't end with a sniper's bullet.
all right.
can you hear me?
it's agent Sinclair.
I helped you with the tables the other day at the community center.
you remember?
hold!
hold! Hold!
calm down, John!
calm down!
easy.
lower that rifle.
get a man in position.
I got nothing to say to you, Sinclair.
okay, maybe you could just listen.
I know about your son.
I know what happened to him.
he was 15 years old.
fifteen.
only I couldn't protect him.
I know.
John, it should have never happened.
but what you're doing, more people are gonna get hurt.
it's too late for all that.
what about the kids?
remember the ones you said could still be saved?
what about them, John?
they still need you.
I'm going to jail;
we both know that.
John, listen to me.
you put that gun down, and you come on out here.
nobody else has to get hurt today, okay?
John! Talk to me.
John, keep talking to me, man.
I'm right here!
Hey, John!
John, talk to me!
you come back out here, John!
get down!
come back to the window!
roll call.
you okay?
he shot himself.
I heard.
how's David?
I sent him home.
Colby's with him.
your man, Sinclair, did himself proud today.
he's got nothing to feel bad about.
we all went home safe, and...
that's about as much as you can ask.
I was gonna go see Rhimes' wife and tell her what happened.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hello!
Yeah, we're coming down.
yeah? Where are you going?
he's got yet another date.
yeah? With-- what's her name-- Donna?
I thought that wasn't going to work out.
well, your brother came to my rescue.
I bought gift number two on that courtship study list: Theater tickets.
according to those matheticians, you know the British ones, this is a sure thing.
well, maybe not a sure thing, but it's certainly better than, you know, soap.
I don't need math to figure that out.
uh, thanks for your insights, my little Don Juan.
so what are you up to tonight, Donny?
well, I thought I was going to hang with you boys, but...
Oh, man, I wish you'd called.
I'm going to Amita's for dinner.
Larry's going to be there
why don't you join us?
I think I'll just grab something to eat here and head home.
yeah? All right.
you sure?
Yeah, go ahead, have fun.
I got stuff to do, anyway.
have a good time.
all right, all right.
say someone steps right up to you, all up in your grill.
what are you going to do?
I know what you want to do, but what are you gonna do?
the first thing you're gonna do is think.
what I'm trying to get you guys to see is there are other ways to keep your respect than just resorting to violence.
you got more options than that.
all right, you'are give me second?
Hey, how you doing?
my assistant told me someone was going take over for John tonight.
I didn't expect it was gonna be you.
Yeah, um...
conflict resolution.
class like that really helped me out when I was a kid, so...
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, you know,
I was a bit of a hard-ass.
was?
you really do like to fight.
maybe you want to sit in.
you know, you could learn some good ways to work things out.
and I won't even call on you.
I'll let you sit there and just watch me.
if you want to.
let them know when you're done, so they can turn out the lights when you leave.
Yes, ma'am.
and I assume an FBI agent like you can figure out how to find my number.
what are you all looking at?
all right, where were we?
talking about options
options to violence, right?
a most impressive showing, Ron.
that was awfully, awfully fast.
thank you. Thank you, thank you.
any thoughts on my pace calculations?
there may be something in the physics of "swing time.
airborne duration during a running stride.
yeah... There are new studies into the time it takes the nervous system to transmit contraction instructions to the muscles: "twitch time."
twitch time.
the whole concept has me examining some interesting algorithmic concepts.
undoubtedly, more interesting when discussed over dinner.
do you care to join us for an Okie Dog?
as much as I hate to run...and run, but I... I've barely got time to shower.
I'm doing calibrations over at the DNA lab most of the night.
larry: Uncharitable as it may sound, it pains me to share your aptitude with genomes.
see you tomorrow afternoon at the LIGO lab, professor.
all right. See you. Professor.
so you're having a sophomore work at your precious Laser Interferometry lab, hmm?
some sophomore!
his technical acumen with complicated machinery unprecedented at the undergrad level.
if he had a similar gift at mathetmatics,
I think we'd be looking at the next Charles Eppes.
go.
I come in to calibrate the synthesizer for the morning tests... I walk in,
I see two guys pushing it down the hall, and I turn around and there's another guy there with a gun, and he cold-cocks me.
david: Was the weapon a shotgun, a handgun; maybe it was a rifle?
no, it was a nickel-plated Beretta.
it was a nine-millimeter.
you know a lot about guns.
you grow up in South Philly, you see your share.
could you recognize the burglars if you saw them again?
the guy with the gun.
the other two guys were pretty far away.
I'd definitely try.
I'll be right back.
okay.
so how is Ron?
he won't be wearing a tight hat anytime soon, but he's fine.
he was walking in, the burglars were coming out and kind of walked right over him.
you guys know him?
Yeah. Ron works with us.
he's one of Larry's assistants at the LIGO project.
larry: Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory.
we measure ripples in space-time, trying to prove the existence of black holes...
it's been said that he's the, uh, the next "Charlie Eppes."
AMITA: What was stolen?
it was a Mark Five DNA Synthesizer.
is that serious?
a DNA synthesizer has many functions, most of them positive:
genetic analysis, anthropological study...
but it's also used to sequence microorganisms,
invertebrate vectors of infectious diseases,
bacterial pathogens...
wait a minute, Charlie, you're saying this thing could make a disease?
no, it can't really make them.
but with the DNA and protein sequence data it contains, it could... customize them.
and by "customize," you mean...
weaponize.
MEGAN: These burglars cut through the roof.
they came in through the air ducts.
what about these sensors? Why didn't they trip?
they're passive infrared motion sensors.
they're body temperature sensitive.
they used these to jam them with high and low temperature signals at the same time-it gave it a false read.
so they had the place cased pretty well ahead of time, right?
really well cased. These floor bolts, they're only unlockable by a biometric iris scanner.
and there's no sign of forced entry.
Yeah; inside job.
looks like it.
what exactly did they take?
a Mark Five DNA Synthesizer.
it can be used to produce a billion DNA copies in under three hours.
we could have a serious national security problem on our hands.
using this synthesizer to determine the sequences of pathogens, those pathogens can then be redesigned for greater infectiousness. So conceivably, this thing could be used to create a pandemic.
using a less sophisticated synthesizer, a professor in New York stitched together a polio virus genome, which then spontaneously started making infectious polio viruses.
the thing can design bioweapons.
there are a lot of rogue nations out there that would like to get their hands on that ability.
COLBY: So we're not just talking about high-end theft here, this could potentially be espionage.
either way, we gotta find the thing before it hits the black market.
don: What'd you say about the biometric sensor?
only five iris scans can open the security bolts.
and all five professors are ablibied.
Charlie: Actually, the biometric sensor doesn't read the iris.
no, it reduces it to a series of values, turning the iris into a constellation of sorts, a diagram of simple lines, connected by unique points.
and each point has a specific value, based on its position,
sort of like how stars are measured by their relationship to one another in the night sky.
the values are represented by a combination unique to the thumbprint, and it is that number that the biometric sensor compares to its database of allowed values.
so then they just hack the combination.
but first they have to decode the scanner's algorithm.
which they had to have prior access to.
and someone would have to have the mathematical and the technical aptitude to run the algorithm.
someone like Professor Charles Eppes.
or maybe the next "Charlie Eppes."
that was a joke, David.
I was making a joke for Larry's benefit.
Wh-What? What?
the kid that walked in on the burglars,
he's supposed to be some kind of technical whiz, right?
and he has access to that DNA lab.
but the security cameras give him an alibi.
only for the actual heist-- he could've had something to do with it: the planning of it, the setting up of it...
an Attempt to Find a 70-Digit Narcissistic Number in Base 12, Hey! Grade Two.
Mm... I was quite... quite, uh, quixotic...in elementary school.
you know, my mother used to pack all my old schoolwork in boxes, so I'm just, uh... taking a trip down memory lane.
is it even remotely possible that our recent discussion of the future has you retreating into the past?
I'm not retreating... I'm simply reminiscing.
reliving old glories-- that can be a dangerous narcotic.
so I understand the campus is abuzz about the, uh... DNA lab burglary.
you know, just color me idealistic, but I find it inconceivable that any student of science could sabotage the efforts of so many for short-term monetary gain.
are there any suspects?
they're talking to a lot of people.
yeah? Anybody in particular?
you know that joke I made to David.
it might have, um...
purely inadvertently...
put some extra attention on, uh... on Ron Allen.
Ron Allen has surmounted incredible obstacles just to get into Calsci... I know.
well, that you could erect one more barrier, just out of some...
some careless remark? Larry.
they're not singling him out.
they're talking to everyone who had access to that lab, okay?
okay.
you know that if you were to fall under similar scrutiny
I would go beyond the boundaries of the observable universe to defend you, and you know that.
huh.
I always thought your interests in... music were computational, not compositional.
what have you got here?
I've never seen this.
don and I took piano lessons when we were children, but...
larry: Hm, "Etude in G Minor" by-- who is that?-- Margaret Mann.
Margaret Mann? That's my mother's maiden name.
she was a lawyer.
larry: Who apparently also composed an etude in G minor.
Yeah, I figured you guys would come back around to me.
why'd you think that?
poor kid from the bad neighborhood.
I been the usual suspect since I was ten.
Ron, we're not talking to you because you had a rough childhood, okay?
you're one of several people with the technical expertise and unrestricted access necessary to pull off this burglary.
I'm not blaming you.
I'd suspect me, too-- a guy who has to work four different jobs just to stay ahead of his student housing bills?
fencing his synthesizer for maybe $50, 000, that'd smooth off a lot of corners.
you seem to have worked out the math pretty thoroughly.
well, when you spend your life with nothing, you know what everything costs.
look, I grew up in foster homes and homeless shelters.
I stole textbooks, and I taught myself enough to get a GED.
I'm too proud of what I've accomplished to risk it all for something so stupid.
MEGAN: It's sort of a persuasive argument.
didn't persuade me so much.
MEGAN: Why? I don't know.
the way he brags about growing up hard.
throws us some street slang to try to sell it.
you think someone with that kind of history wouldn't talk about it so much?
you work that hard to polish yourself...
you want to put some distance on it, too.
when are you guys gonna stop hassling me?
no hassle. We just want to talk.
his shoots a lot further than yours.
sorry.
every time I see a badge, I just want to hurt someone.
someplace private we could talk?
it's not gonna be that long a conversation.
LAPD Burglary Detail gave us a list of go-to guys for high-end break-in tools.
it just so happens your name had a big fat star next to it.
that's 'cause they're lazy.
this shop has been straight for five years, yet you guys are here hassling me every time a safe goes down.
and notice, I'm still not in jail.
so theoretically, if we wanted to get by a passive infrared motion sensor and a biometric iris scanner...
I. R. motion sensor can get jammed with an oscillating heat pulse.
biometrics, I don't know, they're after my time.
well, who picked up the torch?
I don't know. But when you guys find out, why don't you have the LAPD put a big fat gold star next to his name?
COLBY: Clearly this guy knows more than he's saying.
why don't you do a phone dump on his cell and the machine shop.
you know, go back, like, two or three months.
job like this got to take a while to set up, right?
Yeah, think so.
Megan, how we doing on the interviews?
uh, I'm more than halfway through Calsci's list.
what do you make of this Ron Allen kid?
MEGAN: Well, his life story would make a hell of a movie.
uh, remake of The Wrong Man, perhaps?
the administration is asking me and other project managers to suspend Ron from all lab work till your investigation is completed.
well, that might be a good idea, Larry.
the theft of a DNA synthesizer is not a simple one.
in the hands of a hostile government it could be used to create an avian flu virus-- this could be one of the worst WMD threats our country has faced.
listen, I appreciate the seriousness of this theft, but now to my knowledge, you have no evidence that links Ron to this crime.
Hey, Larry,
this is an ongoing investigation here.
you are casting a black cloud over a young man who's faced stupendous odds, a young man whose promise at such a young age, it's incalculable. A young man who isn't real.
I did a deeper background check into Ron Allen.
born in Philadelphia.
august 24, 1987.
died... November 21, '87.
the kid you think Ron Allen is, Larry, he doesn't exist.
there's no sign of him.
well, he had to know it was just a matter of time till we figured out who he was.
Yeah, well, which we still don't know.
what's the matter with this room?
could use a vacuum cleaner.
other than that, it's your typical college kid stuff.
Yeah. Perfectly typical.
but all over the map.
there's hip-hop and heavy metal, and kung fu movies and horror films.
what were you into sophomore year of college?
cheerleaders.
and I was Kurosawa and Coltrane.
but if you look around this room, there isn't one thing that wasn't recorded, written or filmed in the last two years.
it's like he went out and bought a bunch of magazines of what college students were into and then bought everything to make himself look typical. So he wasn't hiding just his identify but also his personality.
Reeves.
that's great. Thank you.
all right, whoever Ron Allen is, he paid his cell phone bill on time-- the GPS just tracked him to a bookstore on campus.
none of the clerks recognized his photo.
I didn't see him hiding in the stacks, either.
why don't we call him and ask where he is?
Yeah, why don't we?
Hello?
excuse me, Miss?
do you know this man?
Oh, um...
that's... Phil.
Phil? Phil Stark, my boyfriend.
would that happen to be his phone? Uh...
he said I could use it.
who are you guys?
Oh, my God, he's not in trouble?
we just want to talk to him.
well... I don't see how you're gonna do that.
why not?
he's in the desert.
he left to go camping yesterday. Great.
so we'll go search the Mojave Desert.
Charlie: So is he Phil Stark or is he, you know, Ron Allen?
well, that's the thing-- he's Phil to his girlfriend, he's Ron Allen to the people at Calsci, there's no fingerprints on the guy anywhere.
well, at least you know one place not to look for him.
Yeah, well, we got a lot of real estate to cover and not a lot of time.
it's bad enough that synthesizer's out there.
we don't know what the guy knows or whose hands he's gonna put it in. You know,
Larry's... devastated.
Alan: Isn't it funny the people who are closest to us, they always find it easy to keep secrets.
Charlie: You know, it's interesting you say that, because I don't recall you ever telling me that Mom was a published composer.
What-what...
what is this?
where did you find this?
I found it in the garage.
what, Mom? Yeah, see?
Oh.
Alan: Yeah.
your mother was a very talented musician.
she even had an offer to study in Vienna.
what are you talking about? No way.
Mm.
Oh, that's why all those piano lessons with the-the nightmare woman...
petrie dish with the lozenge breath. Mrs. Petrie.
you know, one time she filed my fingernails for me. Wait, hold on.
why didn't she ever play?
did you ever see Mom play that piano?
Alan: Well, she had to make a choice between the law and music.
and when she made the choice, then...
music was a closed issue.
except that it wasn't.
these-these compositions are dated through the '80s, through the '90s-- I mean, I think she was writing music up until...
you know?
no, I didn't know.
Hey, hey!
Doug, careful with the TV!
your grandkids are gonna be working for me for free!
come on!
this guy's rap sheet's just about as old as he is.
mostly receiving and possession of stolen property, major ties to about a dozen foreign black markets.
Doug Windham's phone dump had a bunch of calls back and forth with McGinty before the burglary.
there were about a half a dozen after, too, including one 15 minutes after we talked to him.
for a guy not in the burglary business anymore, he sure does keep some shady company.
I want to put together a raid team, but Don doesn't want to risk spooking anybody yet.
last thing we need is that synthesizer leaving the country before we can locate it.
larry: I went to bat for him.
I stormed into your brother's office,
I put my own name on the line for... I don't even know his name.
I made a complete your heart was in the right place.
well-intentioned ignorance is a slender defense at best.
he was a complete and utter fraud.
not a complete fraud.
I mean, he certainly knew how to run this equipment.
and here I am, scrutinizing infinitesimal ripples in the space-time of Einstein's relativistic universe, when all the while, I can't see this, this immense lie played out right before me.
you are exactly right.
why is this not comforting me?
LIGO doesn't see cosmic events, does it?
no, the events emit gravitational waves which we measure with lasers and mirrors.
which is how I'm checking my own predictions on quantum corrections.
well, then.
you didn't see Ron either.
you saw the waves he created.
you were unable to trace Ron Allen's history because he was careful to conceal his past.
what he couldn't conceal, however, was the impact of his past.
I'm so hoping you have one of those cute little analogies for this.
as a matter of fact, I do.
a person's journey through life is like a stone skipping across water.
no matter how briefly it lands in one place, it leaves ripples behind, evidence that it has been there.
now by studying those ripples, we can determine the path of the stone.
and with a little math and a lot of luck, we can determine where the stone began its journey.
Ron Allen's ripples were his facility at operating technically sophisticated apparatus.
couldn't he have learned to use these machines at Calsci?
any one of them, perhaps, but to be able to operate these three different machines with his skill level, well, that's like teaching yourself how to fly a helicopter, sail a yacht and race a Formula One car. So he had to know how to use the same kind of equipment before Calsci then.
and I'm assuming the scientific community at this level is pretty small, right?
somewhere in the tens of thousands.
but I refined my search with a new set of ripples.
remember, track and field.
right, because he ran long distance.
right, so I went through research projects, filtered the names of research assistants against college track meet times, and I found these three.
although, I got to tell you, there's probably more.
university of Hawaii's 2. 2 Meter Telescope, 1996.
Duke's Bioanalysis Group, 1999.
and MIT's Genome Research Team, 2001.
he's like a chameleon.
more like a snake, shedding successive skins.
probably has a new identity by now.
MEGAN: University of Hawaii accepts Paul Combs, who says he grew up on a Wyoming ranch.
he's an unspectacular, but a solid B-student with an interest in astronomy, microbiology and competitive running, who disappeared in 1998.
with seven grand worth of computer equipment.
he surfaces again as Henry Viera, a freshman at Duke in 1999.
this time, he say he grew up on an Alaskan fishing boat.
now he's a better student and a faster runner.
that makes sense.
he knows the classes and runners improve in their mid-20s.
Yeah, only this time his disappearance coincides with the theft of a $15, 000 electron microscope.
hmm.
then Allen Donaldson gets into MIT in 2001.
introduces the "kid from the street" story.
he's got to be on his way to 30, trying to pass for 18 at this point.
star student, star runner, and gone the next year along with something called the Mass Spectrometer, worth upwards of $40, 000.
all right, so, what?
he builds the identities of a dead guy from another state?
so he gets the birth certificate, which gets him a driver's license,
social Security card, all that.
it fits our spy theory.
MEGAN: Actually, it doesn't.
because the stuff he's stealing has value, but it's not sensitive enough for an agent to break cover.
okay, so he's just a thief.
that doesn't really work either, because although he's stealing bigger every time, there's just not enough money there to justify the time he spends as a student.
don: Wait a minute.
what if the thefts weren't an end, but a means?
means to what?
you know, like Ground Hog Day, right?
he gets to live the same life over and over again, but each time better.
like a junkie stealing just enough to get to his next fix.
only his high is from the false celebrity he gets with every new persona.
Yeah, but this thing, the synthesizer's a much bigger deal than that.
cause he needs a bigger fix to get the same high.
right.
we just got lucky on the Gino McGinty wire tape.
we got him on tape planning to move a major piece of merchandise this afternoon.
good.
you know, I don't believe I've ever appreciated the resemblance to Pan before.
the Pentatonic Scale.
it's fascinating how a simple set of fractions can come alive.
what do we have here?
norwegian Willow Flute.
the attendant one-dimensional wave equation has mesmerizing harmonic properties.
it also makes a very nice noise.
okay, uh, not to look a gift horse in the mouth, Larry, but the, uh, the emotional rebound is, uh, is bordering on manic depressive.
look, I'm taking solace in the fact that this man fooled everybody.
so misery loves company.
well, it also loves bright, new research assistants, and I actually interviewed a very promising applicant just today.
there's always another young, brilliant student coming down the road, isn't there?
Yeah, sure.
I mean, one would hope so, right?
let me ask you something.
did you actually think that I was jealous of Ron Allen?
well, I mean...
Yeah, maybe a scooch.
I'll be honest with you. You weren't exactly wrong.
not jealous of Ron,
not specifically...
But?
well, you know, when I was a 13-year-old freshman, it wasn't much fun, but it was cool.
everything I did was that much more impressive, because of how young I was.
and, you know, it was always, "If he's able to accomplish that now," can you imagine what amazing things he'll accomplish when he's 25?
now I'm 30 years old.
listen, listen.
paul Erdich published more than 1500 papers.
he died, literally, at the chalkboard at age 83.
come on.
you haven't seen your best years yet, Charles.
no, but...
I'll never come ahead of schedule again.
anyone interested in lunch?
Hey, you know... we never seem to throw away much from this house, do we?
you know, that was the deal I made with Mom.
she let me quit piano as long as I never quit music entirely.
so you started making your own instruments.
it was a very early sign that parenting Charlie Eppes would present some very unique challenges.
you know, she must have been so disappointed that Don and I didn't like the piano.
and I'm thinking that's the reason that she kept her passion for the piano hidden from us.
no, Charlie, she didn't keep it hidden from you guys.
she kept it hidden from me.
why do you say that?
you know how your mother and I met?
sure, you were working for a housing developer and she was an intern for a tenants rights organization, right?
Ooh, a latter day Romeo and Juliet story.
you see, um, we decided that I would support her in her last year of law school and she would support me through graduate school.
then she told me that music wasn't really a serious option for her.
she was too much in love with the law.
somehow I think I was a little too eager to believe her.
she just didn't want me to know what a hard decision it was.
that she gave up something that she really loved.
larry: For something she loved more, Alan.
you can't lose sight of that.
well... maybe.
about time you guys got here.
this thing's been burning a hole in my warehouse.
get this thing on the truck.
come on!
you got to be kidding me.
keep your hands there.
don't move. FBI.
against the truck. Hands on your head.
let's go.
let me ask you something.
since when is selling quality electronics at low prices a federal crime?
since you started selling Mark V DNA synthesizers.
so your buyer was Cuban.
a Cuban national.
is that right?
that's right. To tell you the truth,
I'm as shocked as you are.
I got you selling a bioterror weapon to an enemy state.
Bioterror? Yeah.
Ah. And I thought it was a photocopier.
we got you.
we got you on tape.
windham calling you and telling you we were getting close.
never seen this kid before in my life.
you gonna waste my time here, Gino?
he tipped you off, only he'd never done a job this big before so he needed your expertise.
no, no-- I sell electronics, okay?
Yeah, sometimes I don't know where they're coming from or where they're going, but I don't steal.
fact-- you set him up with a crew.
fact-- you sent him to Windham to get the tools.
so what are you talking to me? Go talk to Windham.
well, selling tools isn't a crime, but using them is, and in this case it's a Federal rap-- treason.
that's life in SuperMax.
so you know that little mistake, that, that thing you've been worried about doing for the last 15 years?
well, you made it. You sure made it now, buddy.
I paid Doug Windham, 50 Gs for the damn thing.
I took it out of his shop myself.
so what, you're telling me he stole it?
all I know is Windham's too greedy to help some kid set up a score and settle for short money.
now, I can guarantee you, he was his partner whether he liked that or not.
FBI! Let's go!
take the office.
Hey, David. Come take a look at this.
bullet to the chest, no sign of a fight.
well, the techs just gave us a fast fingerprint match to the ones we lifted from Ron Allen's dorm room.
I'm thinking maybe Allen shows up looking for for his payoff, has some kind of beef with Windham and wins.
now he's got maybe 50 grand disappearing money.
or maybe not.
foreman says they're missing a portable plasma cutter.
burns through metal like butter.
they use it to cut though vault doors in case of emergencies.
????
matter-- solid liquid, gas, and, when you superheat gas... plasma.
actually, you know what?
there's five, if you consider, Bose-Einstein condensates...
which we really don't need to consider, right?
no, I guess not.
a plasma cutter uses an electrode circuit to spark a stream of directed plasma.
30, 000 degrees Fahrenheit at 20, 000 feet per second.
now, this particular model can cut ten inches...
all right, all right. ...of one-inch steel plate in under a minute.
which means Ron Allen-- whoever he is, can walk through just about any door he feels like.
so, the question is, what is the guy after?
I think he's looking to do something spectacular.
something to save his jilted ego.
I mean, he's being competing against kids with less experience for nine years.
he knows that's all gonna come out and he's gonna be held up to ridicule. So, he's got to prove to us that he's not some loser, that he's a genius.
Oh, he's no genius.
he's Wesley Shryer from the suburb of Wheaton, Illinois.
a cop from Wheaton PD recognized him from one of the older photos we sent out.
they went to high school together.
cop says, and I quote, "He was average to the point of forgettable.
went to community college for two years.
then he dropped off the face of the Earth after '95.
whoever he is, we better find him, before he steps up his game.
larry: Fraud or not,
Ron worked on an impressive breadth of research.
biochemistry, astrophysics, genetics...
Yeah, but doing the same thing over and over again.
never challenging himself, never reaching...
I'm wondering if I see a little of myself in Ron.
you?!
well... listen, I can vouch for your academic credentials, and to the best of my knowledge, you're not homicidal.
I'm talking about living in a bubble.
the safe, comfortable world of academia.
but Charlie, I don't know anyone who challenges himself as relentlessly as you do.
Yeah, and as far as living in some academic bubble,
I mean, look at us.
we're out in this garage.
we're trying to predict a thief's next target by connecting experience with-with potential targets.
and we're not there yet.
we need to find a new approach, a, uh, a shortcut of some sort.
something like... like Benford's Law.
benford's Law?
that's a simple probability observation.
no, that's not all it is.
if you take any table of wide-ranging values,
census data, test results, land mass sizes,
1 appears as the first digit in more than 30% of the values,
2 appears 17. 6%,
3 appears 12. 5%.
and so on...
larry: You know, the old story goes that Simon Newcomb discovered it by flipping through books of logarithm tables.
he discovered that the earlier pages are more worn than the later ones.
benford's Law is not about conscious decision making.
it is a statistical phenomenon.
precisely.
which is why it's highly unlikely that Ron Allen spent nine years working at a specific theft?!
I mean, after all, the most valuable machines today didn't even exist nine years ago.
that's right.
Ron's knowledge base would pull him mo toward one target than another.
so, he opens his book of knowledge to a well-worn page where the spine is already cracked.
university of Hawaii's telescope.
he worked with cosmic gravitation signatures.
which explains his familiarity with LIGO's raison d'etre.
at Duke, he worked with Beowulf computer clusters...
LIGO has a Beowulf Cluster.
and with MIT's genome project, he must have come in contact with lasers...
lasers photodetectors. Photodetectors...
LIGO is the well-worn page.
he's gonna rob the LIGO lab.
my LIGO lab?!
all right, come on.
you know, why don't you let me go first, just in case?
no, no, if he has already been in here,
I don't even know if I want to live.
okay, the computers...
they all seem to be here...
and accounted for.
of course, the big-ticket items... they're in here.
all right, well, why don't you open that up?
laser diodes alone are worth $150, 000 apiece.
the sapphires, upwards of half a million.
that's a sapphire?
invaluable in optics.
you know, bathysphere windows? Those are sapphires.
now, those are fabricated, but still intensely expensive.
and where's the other one? Oh, it's down in the LIGO tunnel with the laser.
okay, uh, so nothing's missing.
no, it would appear we got here first.
that is, if he's coming.
MEGAN: Do you see that?
don, we've got a suspicious vehicle parked in the middle of the running track.
right, well, check it out, and let me know what you see.
what's that running track? Like, a mile from here?
four kilometers, I would think.
all right, so they're not our guys.
wait, wait, wait, wait. The LIGO tunnel.
what about it?
measurements are taken by shooting lasers through an L-shaped vacuum pipe with four-kilometer arms.
now, that thing runs directly beneath the running track, and it bypasses all of our alarm systems.
you just said there's a sapphire in the tunnel.
all right, Megan, that's our guys. Go, go, go!
FBI! MEGAN: FBI! Get down on the ground.
let me see your hands. Get down!
get down.
FBI! Get down on your knees right...
get down on your knees.
FBI! Get your hands up!
come on, I got him!
down! Get down!
put your hands behind your head.
get your hands on your head. Get your hands on your head!
face down, right now.
I knew I couldn't keep it going anymore.
it got harder and harder to pass for 18.
the more places I worked, the more I worried I'd run into someone I knew.
the scientific community just isn't that big.
the LIGO job was supposed to be my retirement.
so, why steal the synthesizer?
you had to know that was going to bring some attention to you.
I needed the cash to put the heist together.
and I was still on schedule until you guys tipped to Windham.
and then Windham wanted a piece of the LIGO job, so you shot him?
things got crazy, but... it wasn't me.
it was Jackson.
Oh, yes, Ron.
blame the dead guy.
it's the truth.
you have to know how funny that word sounds as it comes out of your mouth.
you know, every one of those schools turned down Wes Shryer, the B student from the good high school.
they weren't judging me for my merit, for my ability, for my potential.
they penalized me for not having some hard luck story.
so, you penalized people with real hard luck.
all I did was level the playing field.
get my fair shot.
fair?
spend 18 years dodging gangs...
working to help support your family...
beating every odd out there just to get your high school diploma.
you do that and you can sit here and talk to me about what's fair.
Hello?
dad?
dad...
I was thinking...
that seems to be your perpetual state, Charlie.
about Mom.
her music...
yeah...
I've been thinking about that a lot, too, Charlie.
I went through guilt... and anger...
an irrational sense of betrayal...
that she hid this from me.
dad, I don't think she was hiding it.
well, not in the way you mean.
you know, I have places that I'd like to go to be alone.
I go hiking.
you go fishing.
do you think your mother needed to be alone with her music?
it's just part of being human, you know?
to want to find... someplace solely for yourself.
whether it be outside in the world or...
deep inside your head.
it's okay...
dad, it's me.
pick up.
stuff's happening at school.
I need you. Come and get me.
please! - Oh, my god.
hey... dmg rules.
I've been the principal at this school for nine years.
we've had problems, but nothing like this.
okay, why don't you tell me what you know so far?
Oh, god, there were two shooters.
eight people were killed.
seven students and one of my teachers.
12 more kids were wounded.
it all happened in like six minutes.
all right, I'm going to want to talk to the students, teachers, security, everybody.
I' get a list.
don, found one of the shooters.
Hey. - Hey.
this is Paul Elins.
he's 17 years old.
he's a senior here and he was absent today.
the headset, the mask, the whole thing matches the witness accounts.
looks like he killed this girl right here.
victim's name is becky flynn.
he shoots her and then gets taken out himself.
Thanks.
that has to be the other shooter.
security never got off a round.
so what do we think, a suicide pact?
Yeah, only the other shooter couldn't close the deal.
or didn't. If we're talking about a sociopath, he might have told his partner one thing and had something else in mind.
he probably escaped in the crowd.
SWAT found his bag and all his stuff ditched in an empty locker near the exit.
is that hers?
says "dad.
it's gonna go to voice mail.
hello.
excuse me, sir.
my name is Don Eppes. I'm with the FBI.
um, look, sir, I'm afraid I have some bad news.
we all use math every day, to predict weather, to tell time, to handle money.
math is more than formulas and equations.
it's logic...
rationality.
it's using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.
paul Elins was an honor student.
he excelled in math, computers and he got acceptance letters from half the schools in the Ivy League.
all right, so where's the dark cloud?
parents divorced last year.
he fell into a depression.
discipline problems...
I mean, why pick up a gun and start killing other kids?
there's got to be some kind of trigger.
all right, so who were his friends?
I mean, the odds are the second shooter's a student now, right?
who was probably absent today, too.
Yeah, but even if we isolate his friends, we could still be looking at a lot of kids.
well, this might help. Student id.
there's a chip on the back.
school takes attendance by using radio frequency identification technology.
radio frequency identification.
that's a tagging system that companies use to track packages, inventory and shipping and stuff.
I read the technology section.
Yeah, yeah. And?
chip on the id communicates with a network of sensors around the school.
central computer tracks the students.
it's like a gps system.
that sounds a bit big brother to me.
it's not 100%.
the kids leave it at home, they forget it in the locker.
but, it should definitely be able to narrow it down for us which kids were running away.
which will tell us who we can eliminate as suspects.
and anyone who was absent, we can run down their alibis.
that school has metal detectors.
how did they get the guns inside?
they got them in there somehow.
well, if the system can tell us where each kid is, then we should match it with witness statements and map the shooters' route.
by "we," I mean Charlie.
I got you thinking like a mathematician.
however, I'm not too keen on your method.
see, there's a natural flaw in witness statements.
and statistics show that memory is often unreliable.
Charlie, that's all we got, so...
actually, you do have more than that.
Neptune. - Neptune? As in the planet?
the discovery of Neptune occurred because scientists inferred its presence due to its gravitational force on other planetary bodies.
from the observable, we can divine the unobservable.
right.
remember that trick we did when we were kids?
the soap and pepper trick.
Yeah, you put pepper in the water, you put the soap in and then the pepper goes everywhere.
same principle.
except let's say the students are the specks of pepper and the bar of soap are the shooters.
the shooters arrive
and just like the pepper, repelled, in this case, by breaking surface tension, the students flee.
they scatter in a predictable pattern. - Yeah, how's that?
using non-linear pursuit-evasion equations.
which show how predators pursue their prey.
Yeah, but wait, you can see the soap.
here's the beauty of it.
let's try this trick again, but this time with clear liquid soap.
now you can't see the soap, but the pepper behaves in precisely the same manner.
it's just the same with our two students.
though they may be unobservable, it's the observable-- the fleeing students, that will tell us, not just how the shooters got into the school, but every single move they made thereafter.
according to students who were there these shooters were targeting people out in the open.
jocks, popular kids, mainly.
a couple of them said these guys would point a gun at one of them and shoot the person right next to them.
no one has exactly jumped to the front of the line to say they were best pals with the shooter either.
isolation also fits the profile.
several students said this kid Paul Elins was a part of a group of boys.
called themselves the dmg: "Dark matter guild.
computer geeks mostly.
do we know anything else about them?
well, apparently the editor of the school newspaper did a profile on them a couple months back.
her name's Karen Camden. So, we're running that down.
why is that name so familiar?
she was the other girl in the closet when becky flynn was shot.
whoever said that I'm the leader of dmg, they're full of it.
actually, you said it, Greg, in an interview with Karen Camden.
all right, you want to know about the dmg?
it's simple.
we're just a guild of gamers, that's all.
a guild?
I take it you don't know much about m-m-o-r-p-g's.
like starting with what the hell they are-- no.
massive multi-player online role-playing games.
a guild is a team of players online.
of which Paul Elins was a member.
look, I'm as shocked about what Paul did as anybody else.
what is the dark matter guild?
like I said, we're a team.
dark matter is just a component of the universe that exists all around us that remains unseen.
well, you and your pals just stick to video games or do you engage in other activities, as well?
I don't know anything about the shooting, if that's what you mean.
why were you absent from school? - I had a cold.
you look pretty healthy right now.
look, I told you, I don't know anything.
and I can't think of anybody in the guild that would condone what Paul did, let alone be a part of it.
the dmgare gamers, not killers.
poor Becky.
I keep thinking why didn't he shoot me?
that's not your fault, Karen.
and you're never going to know why. It could be anything.
it could be because you wrote that article in the school newspaper about the dmg.
I just wanted kids to understand who they were.
so many kids dissed them, you know.
calling them dorks, cyber-geeks.
you know, jocks pick on geeks every day.
bullying happens.
it just doesn't usually end like this.
I could see his eyes, through his mask.
he looked so angry.
and what about the other shooter?
I never saw him.
but he shot Paul Elins.
Yeah.
after I just sat there and waited.
I tried to help Becky, but...
when I didn't hear anything, I just ran.
you got to know these kids pretty well, didn't you?
I guess.
Karen, I need to find that other boy before he hurts someone else or he hurts himself.
do you have any idea who that second shooter might be?
there's a half a dozen boys in the dmg.
it could be any one of them.
Yeah, but did you get a feeling about any of them?
did you have a thought that maybe one of them was capable of something like this?
anything you say to me is just between us.
paul used to hang with this kid named Justin Price.
and what makes you think him?
Justin's scary...
into guns...always bragging about how he has this huge collection.
and he always used to talk about columbine.
Thanks.
Hey, guys.
kid on the left is Justin Price.
Karen Camden describes him as some kind of angry loner type.
mom's a single parent.
she travels a lot. Neighbor said she's away at a convention right now, so we checked the house. There's no sign of him.
Yeah, I got a file on him. He's got a juvenile delinquency record
out of the 77 kids who didn't show up on the attendance data that day, we were able to account for 46 of them who were actually there, just not wearing their id badges.
so what's that? Like 31 absent, huh?
Yeah. Including Justin Price.
so the ATF trace on the guns at the school show that they were registered to a john price, deceased.
he's Justin Price's uncle.
the guns were off the grid, but, apparently, he voluntarily registered them.
all right, I'd say we got our second shooter there, right?
Hey, guys, what's up?
our preliminary analysis of the first minutes of the attack show that the shooters entered through the southwest entrance.
according to the police report, the southwest metal detectors were down for scheduled maintenance.
coincidence?
well, as a prominent cosmologist once said, "coincidence is the last refuge of the uninspired.
what cosmologist said that? - Oh...
Hey, are these the two shooters? - Yeah.
kid on the right is the other one we think might be. Why?
I know this place. This is an all-night cyber cafe.
Yeah, they've got a retro-version of asteroids there.
I quite enjoy it.
Karen Camden said the dmg kids were teased for being "cyber geeks.
if they're hiding out, they'd probably go someplace comforting.
and open 24 hours.
all right. Why don't you guys check it out?
he's inside. In the back room.
alone? - Yeah. Isolated in the corner.
you two cover the front. Swat's got the back.
let's do it.
#We are FBI, go back to the living room.
Justin Price, we are FBI!
#Everybody down on the ground call an ambulance.
no.
he was just a kid.
so the forensics came back on Justin Price, and the blood on his boots does match the victims at the crime scene.
we got a second shooter.
Yeah, but there's another problem.
the gun that David and Colby found on price at the cyber cafe only matches two of the five kills that he's credited with at the high school.
Yeah. Wait, he didn't have any others on him?
no. And, like the first shooter, he was probably packing more than one gun, which means that gun is still out there.
Yeah. Plus the rest of the uncle's arsenal.
right. So now we have a bunch of guns and a bunch of really emotional kids who might have the potential of getting their hands on them.
let's get every single kid in that dmg on surveillance, right?
I mean, we got to find those guns.
at 11: 02: 58, Scott Kang was at x-y coordinates 335/211, heading north.
Oh, evolution is a cruel mistress.
human intellect grows unbounded, while our emotional maturity is sadly behind.
high school will always be high school, you know?
the jocks versus the geeks, and the popular versus the ostracized.
I remember.
Yeah, but, you know, time was when we solved our differences with fists, not automatic weaponry.
times change.
and it's not just guns.
radio frequency identification chip and tracking systems.
if this weren't the new millennium, I'd swear it's all very 1984.
Mmm. You know, Megan feels the same way.
speaking of, what was that smile she gave you all about?
Oh, it's her smile. Ask her.
wait a second. Can someone clue me in here?
well, the fact is, for some time now, though it's not my specific discipline,
I have felt a certain chemistry with megan.
which you've kept fairly well under wraps.
precisely why my next overture will be overt.
you're going to ask Megan out, Larry? - Yeah. But I don't know.
given our disjointed diversity,
I'm... I'm fearful.
what is it, Charlie?
this last grouping of data entries...
it shows students running towards the shooter, and not away from him.
but that obviously doesn't make sense at all.
it could be an anomaly in the data.
or an anomaly in the school.
these school plans are old.
walls could have been moved, obstructions introduced...
if you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting
field work-- god, I vowed never to return to high school.
Mrs. Price, your son Justin was associated with a group of boys at school known as the "dark matter guild.
what can you tell me about them?
just that they were friends who would hang out, play video games.
and have you ever met any of them?
I met Paul Elins a few times.
I never met any of the other kids.
I work in health care.
it's long hours.
I'm on the road three days a week.
I wasn't able to keep tabs on Justin the way I would have liked to.
that sounds like you were concerned.
I asked my brother john to spend some time with him.
you know, I wanted him to have a male role model.
he was in the service.
I thought he could teach him.
but, after john was killed, it affected Justin.
nothing that I said mattered.
and, Mrs. Price, do you know where your brother john kept his collection of guns?
I asked him to get rid of them.
I assumed he had.
we think there's more guns out there.
I ran a credit check, and found a storage unit that was leased in your name.
the fees were paid by money order.
I didn't know anything about it.
you think I'm an awful mother, don't you?
I think you're a woman who's lost her son and feels responsible.
my son murdered a teacher.
he killed all those children.
how do I live with that?
the banality of evil is only banal to those who never see it.
my senior year, a student showed up at school with a gun.
he held two kids hostage.
what happened?
eventually, he let them go.
then he climbed up to the roof and jumped.
it's a different world than the one I grew up in.
now, given the rate at which my calculations show that the shooters moved...
Hey, you guys, you know what? I'll tell you what.
you guys mind if I borrow your walkie-talkies?
thank you.
Thanks.
what... what are you thinking here, Charles?
you suggested I test my equations in the field.
time me.
okay, Larry. Time?
uh... 58 seconds. Charles, what is it?
I need to talk to don.
we searched that storage locker that Justin Price rented.
found some unused ammo.
but if he was storing guns there once, they're not there now.
we did find this.
take a look.
it's a security schedule.
Yeah. It shows that the metal detectors were down at the southeast entrance of the school the morning of the shooting.
all right, so they knew exactly where to enter.
Yeah. We found downloaded blueprints of the school, too.
Hey. What's this?
it's a home-made "modded" video game we took off of Justin Price's laptop.
he was playing with Paul Elins the night before the shooting.
what do you think? Like some kind of dress rehearsal?
only they weren't the only ones playing.
we have evidence other dmg kids were online as well.
Hey, guys, there's a problem with the radio frequency identification data I need to show you guys.
all right. Well, put it up.
okay, I managed to map the movements of the students.
now, these red dots-- these are students.
and the black x's-- those are the shooters.
now, during the first two minutes of the attack, the students behaved as one would expect.
all right. Well, then, what's the problem?
eventually, a group of students actually started moving toward shooter number two.
maybe there was a dead end over there or something.
no. No. I walked those halls.
there was no dead end, David.
but check this out.
these are the locations and the times of death of our murdered victims.
now, according to the data, the time between the murder of victim number four and the murder of victim number seven was 33 seconds.
however, I retraced the steps of shooter number two, and I found that where victim number four was murdered to where victims numbers five, six and seven were murdered, took twice that amount of time.
so what does that mean?
we know that shooter number one took out these three victims.
and we know shooter number two took out these two.
what about the other three victims?
there's only one explanation for the aberration in the anomaly, and that is that you guys aren't just looking for a missing gun.
guess what? You're looking for a third shooter.
agent reeves, my secretary says that you think there was a third shooter.
I'm afraid that's what it looks like.
first these shootings, then Justin Price gunned down.
now you say another one of my kids is involved?
where does this end?
I think as soon as we find this third gunman.
I wanted to reopen school, get the kids back to some kind of normal routine.
I can see now that's not possible.
Mr. Northrup, right now we need your cooperation.
we need the files of everyone associated with the dmg.
that might be a problem.
what do you mean? Why?
well, the parents of these children feel their kids are being unfairly singled out.
they've hired lawyers and they make it clear that they won't consent.
so you're saying we need a court order?
I'm afraid that's what it's going to take.
there may be another way. - How?
construct the information from public records.
military personnel have the same access as colleges.
transcripts, activities, club memberships.
Justin Price had a criminal record.
maybe one of the members of the dmg does, too.
anything in the public record we can use the patriot act to get at.
eight dead, 12 wounded.
I'd call that an act of domestic terrorism.
more files. Sorry, team.
Oh, it's okay.
Charlie promised to take a look at the data for my solar physics presentation.
thank you.
and you still think you can do this in one day?
Yeah, using my support vector classifier, yeah. Sure.
see, the algorithm's going to go through it all, okay?
grades, activities, disciplinary actions
to evaluate traits ascribed to the radio frequency identification 's school shooter profile.
still seems like a really tall order.
you know, michelangelo always said that his sculptures already existed.
it was merely up to him to release them from their prison.
well, what he means is that this process is a lot like that of a sculptor.
preserving only what's relevant to the image he seeks, a sculptor chips away at a block.
well, in this case, the algorithm tells the computer which details from the public records to keep and which to "chip away at"-- which to discard as irrelevant
until slowly an image appears from this massive block of data...
which, you know, if we're lucky, correlates with an already existing image:
a profile of our random school shooter.
I know a lot of women who'd like to get ahold of your algorithm and run it against the personals to find the perfect man.
Oh, hey, you know you said we were supposed to do something earlier, remember?
you said it. We're supposed to do it. Let's go.
right.
see you. - Right. Bye.
what was that about?
merely a very crude attempt at lending privacy.
at the risk of sounding embarrassingly misguided, would you care to join me for dinner?
or a show, perhaps?
or maybe even some terpsichorean pleasure?
I don't know what the third one means, - but dinner sounds nice. - Okay.
on one condition,
you have to take me for a ride in the car.
delighted. - Call me.
I will. I will call you.
Charlie said he's halfway through his analysis.
so far, he's got no hits.
we're stuck without those student files,
I can tell you that.
what about the court orders?
the kids' lawyers are hemming and hawing, so it may take the judge another day.
I'm hoping this may help.
I found on the school's internet service provider in the deleted files an e-mail sent out the day before the attack cc'ing all the members of the dmg telling them to be careful at school the next morning.
guess who sent it?
what, Gregory Dietrich?
there you go.
Yeah. So I'm gonna give it to the judge and I'm hoping if we push, we might be able to get a warrant for his file in the next couple of hours.
all right. Do it. Pick up the kid, but let's be careful now, all right?
still revisiting high school, Charles?
just mapping our shooters' third route.
you got a date, huh?
you don't seem too excited.
mine is an inner frenzy.
like some highly agitated molecular brew.
I can't even settle on a restaurant.
well, you know, Italian's always romantic.
the kinetics of angel hair and red sauce, it's a bit too much of a challenge, I'm afraid.
Plus, I think I prefer not to wear a bib.
I think you need to loosen up, you know?
free your molecules, and your ass will follow.
Oh, yeah, well, sound advice.
I just ran Gregory Dietrich's student file through analysis.
he's the leader of the dmg.
he scored off the charts on the FBI's school shooter profile.
our algorithm came through, my man.
Larry-- still debating the complexities of Capellini.
no, I'm just considering the complexities of shooter three's route.
if your main goal was simply to shoot other students, why such a convoluted path?
I don't know. Insanity maybe?
Oh, no. Even a crazy person can get from point "a" to point "B.
two months ago, Gregory Dietrich made an online purchase of an "evil twin" kit.
what is that?
it's a hacking device to tap into wifi networks and steal sensitive data.
so what? So they can get blueprints and security schedules, - stuff like that? - Exactly like that.
our guys detected a wifi breach at the high school security data base a week after Dietrich bought the device.
traced it to him?
Yeah, the kid's not so smart, after all.
further proof of that.
surveillance just saw him running into his house like a man on a mission.
Ah, the lawyer must have tipped him off. He's making his move.
I can't get my head around this whole high school shooting thing, you know. I mean, I came from a small town.
there's 200 kids in my high school, not 2, 100.
everybody knew everybody.
if some punk was running around with a pile of guns and bad intentions, we'd know about it.
I don't get it either, man.
where I grew up, this kind of stuff didn't happen.
don't get me wrong. Kids got shot, but it was over something, you know?
pair of sneakers, insult, drugs.
it was definitely stupid, but looking at those kids shot in their own school...
wouldn't have thought about it at the time, but...
maybe we were luckier than we thought growing up where we did.
Yeah.
there he is.
#Five boxes he is going to run...
yeah? Ten bucks says I catch him.
#I got the kid!
I got the bag!
you should spend a little more time in P. E. Kid.
going hunting, Gregory?
I got nothing to say!
Yeah. That one's new.
stand up. Let's go.
your client was in possession of a semiautomatic weapon.
a gun that was part of a collection that was owned by Justin price's uncle.
which doesn't prove a thing, unless that gun was used in the attack.
why'd you have it?
you don't have to answer that.
no, no, it's okay. I want to answer him.
Justin gave me the gun.
we'd go off into the woods.
we'd fire off a couple rounds at cans and stuff.
and while you were out there, no one ever mentioned going and shooting up the school?
that I won't let him answer.
you bought a device to hack into the school's database to steal blueprints.
we have your name right here.
we traced it to you.
it's your name, isn't it?
those blueprints were for my game.
for authenticity. - For authenticity?
wake up.
these are kids you went to school with.
they were shot in cold blood.
authenticity.
it wasn't me!
but you hated them, didn't you?
look, why don't you guys try living with it every day?
the way they look at you like, like you're not even there.
so you took your revenge.
it was Paul and Justin.
but you wish it was you, don't you?
I think we're done here.
his lawyer's right, you know?
the gun we found on him isn't a match for our missing weapon.
you're not going to like this much, either.
his e-mail story holds up.
that warning that was sent out to the other dmg members?
it was sent from his account, but it originated from the school library.
so he sent it from the school.
not unless he was in two places at once.
his school I. D. Badge says he cut out early that day.
his ATM card and a security cam photo says he was making a withdrawal the same time the e-mail was sent.
he created the game, he's the leader.
all this goes down and he's got nothing to do with it?
I don't buy that.
Charlie, your advice-- "free your molecules"?
I made a reservation for Megan and i at an Ethiopian restaurant.
ethiopian, on Fairfax. Thinking outside the box.
wish me well.
Hey, you know, um, you were right.
shooter number three's route doesn't conform to any predictable pursuit-evasion result.
I'm thinking that I must be missing a variable.
up until now
I got to be honest
I think we've been looking at this school shooting the wrong way.
let's take a look at the route taken by our first two shooters.
their movement is methodical.
they are pursuing students in a logical progression.
now let's take a look at our third shooter.
appears here and for the next minute makes his way through the school killing victims until vanishing here.
most likely changed clothes.
shooter number three's route is circuitous.
it's inefficient.
Yeah, but it's a random shooting spree.
doesn't it make sense that he'd choose a random path?
intuitively, yes, but, well, mathematically, no.
mathematicians apply a path minimization to analyze this kind of predator-prey dynamic.
what exactly is that?
the snake pursues the mouse.
mouse runs, the snake is relentless and tracks every step.
and when it runs into obstacles, it finds the quickest, most economical way around them.
now using path minimization, we can predict the snake's path because the snake only has one thing on its mind
finding the most efficient point a to point b between it and its dinner.
so shooter number three is just a lousy snake, or what?
shooter number three's route was definitely not determined by path minimization.
so... what then?
maybe this.
now we know that the school uses radio frequency identification chip technology to take attendance;
tells teachers when students are in class and when they're absent.
keeps track of students using a PDA.
right. Names and locations of the students show up on the screen.
the dmg kids, we know they have the capability to break into the school security system.
Yeah, so why couldn't they hack into the radio frequency identification ?
they definitely weren't taking attendance.
Charlie's right.
can you bring up the model for shooter number three?
look at the behavior in the model.
he's letting the students go right by him without even taking a shot.
because he's targeting specific students--the quarterback, the skateboarder and the swim team captain.
and the system would tell him exactly where they are.
Oh, that... no, that's sufficient. thank you.
so the last time I had Ethiopian food
I was at a conference on bond accretion in Addis Ababa.
what? Oh, am I being tedious?
no, no, tedious would be a week at Quantico studying note-taking skills at a crime scene.
Oh, speaking of which, I heard you and Charlie went down to the school.
Yeah. It was horrific.
I just kept thinking all the while, you know, if I could only corral a wormhole and go back in time, just talk to these young men before they did it.
and what would you say to them?
I would say high school is ephemeral.
and I don't know if the meek inherit the earth, but bill gates and the google guys...
you know, they did all right.
you seem to have done well.
no. Well, now, but in high school?
Oh, I don't think you and i would've been at the same table.
in fact, I wasn't permitted a table.
I was kind of a mess in high school.
yeah? That surprises me.
it was a surprise to most people, particularly my parents who could, you know, barely show their face at the country club for a while.
Oh, no, country club. You're one of those.
social register, too.
you're full of surprises, you know that.
so this FBI thing, why did you become a g man?
well, it's a little more complicated, but I have three older sisters, and I was my father's last chance at having a son.
I could play every ball game known to man.
as I got older, it just got harder to switch gears.
in fairness, I should say that the FBI has given me the greatest sense of equilibrium
I do feel very balanced.
you do seem a little distracted tonight.
it's just the case.
you know, Charlie's math shows that our main suspect fits the shooter profile for a school shooting.
but his math also shows us that our shooter number three wasn't on a killing rampage.
you know, I'm failing to see the inconsistency.
the first two shooters fit the profile of a school shooter.
they show unbridled rage.
this third shooter...was calculated.
it was a planned attack.
it's indicative of a whole other motive.
you know, in cosmology, when faced with logical inconsistencies,
I like to fall back on an old chestnut:
if you don't like the answer, ask a different question.
6: 00 A. M. I get a call from Charlie saying we got some new angle on the case.
it was something that Larry said to me over dinner last night.
wait, wait, you and Larry had dinner last night?
Oh, god. Moving on.
he just got me thinking.
you and I both have our doubts that Dietrich is the third shooter.
right.
so what if we need to look at this in reverse?
what if we need to study the victim ology?
shooter number three picked all of his targets for a specific reason.
there has to be a reason why.
Oh, I see. So, what, just have Charlie do what he was doing with the suspects, but do it with the victims?
Yeah. If we can find the common denominator it might take us back to the killer.
all right, that's good.
Where'd you have dinner?
so I ran a cluster analysis on the student files of our three victims-- Rob Holt, skateboard dude;Thomas Caballo, quarterback;and Louis Ives, swim team captain.
the two jocks share numerous commonalities
they're both seniors, both captains of their squad.
what about skateboard dude?
his only commonality is that his name appeared in an investigation of steroid abuse by student athletes.
he was a suspected supplier.
some of the students mentioned that.
the school investigated, but nothing came of it.
any other correlations?
all three names appeared in a police report of a keg party that got so rowdy the neighbors complained.
however, there were a dozen students on that report.
none of them were victims, none of them had any apparent relationship to the victims.
Yeah, but still, maybe something happened at the party.
Yeah, something enough to motivate a killer.
you got a list of kids at the party?
can you put it up? - Yeah.
we just need to find the connection betweent her and one of the dmg kids.
wait a minute, she was on the police report?
she has a connection to all the dmg kids.
Yeah, she wrote a story about them for the school paper.
she knows them really well.
she knows they were having violent fantasies.
Yeah, but why would she want to take part in this attack?
I don't know, but it might explain why they spared her, not just because she gave them props in the school newspaper.
Absolutely.
maybe she's in on it.
Karen Camden purchased a wifi PDA three weeks ago.
okay, so that would allow her to track anyone in school, right?
her credit card showed a bunch of charges to a motel in the valley.
the manager recognized her and Justin Price.
Oh, a pretty girl could get a teenage boy to do a lot of things.
especially if he's not used to the attention.
and if he has the inclination. Look at Pamela Smart, she got one to kill her husband for her.
so what, she seduces price, uses him and blows him off?
she could've even gotten him to shoot Paul Elins, his own friend.
she could've made up the whole murder-suicide pact.
probably knew he was fantasizing about the shootings and then just pushed him over the edge-- and becomes the third shooter.
Why? What's the motive?
well, best guess, we look at the victims.
the answer's probably going to lay there.
school steroid scandal.
article was written by Karen Camden.
I thought that investigation went nowhere.
no prosecutions, but some of the team captains lost their college scholarships.
yeah? Just to get even, huh?
Karen's not a violent person.
she'd never do anything like this.
Yeah, but something happened at that party, didn't it?
something that changed your daughter.
Mrs. Camden, we have eight people dead and 12 more in the hospital.
if you know the reason for this, we need you to speak.
they raped me.
Becky was the one who set it up.
she invited me to that party.
helped rob holt, Mr. Skateboard cool, slip something into my drink.
then Jake Porter raped me and the others watched and took pictures.
Oh, god, Karen. God, honey.
I wrote that story about the steroids.
#but ...
they blamed me for messing up their scholarships.
why didn't you press charges?
they were the stars of the school.
it would be my word against theirs.
Karen, eight people are dead that you went to school with every day.
I'm going to need you to put your hands behind your back.
I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
yeah?
take your headgear off, tough guy.
we want to talk to you.
what's this about?
you're under arrest for the rape of Karen Camden.
what are you talking about?
we spoke to Karen.
she gave us a statement about what happened at the party.
you're talking about the same girl who shot up the school with her psycho-geek pals, right?
everybody's talking about how she's the one who engineered the whole thing.
you're telling me you believe Karen Camden?
the girl's a whack job.
it'll be my word against hers.
Yeah, would've been.
except for rob holt's cell phone.
your moron friend took a picture of you with his phone.
let's go. Turn around.
I'm not going anywhere with you guys.
Yeah, you are. You're coming with us.
get off me.
what is it with guys and dirty pictures?
stand up.
Where's big papa?
the caterer.
Ah, getting serious.
I just think he doesn't want to have to cook, you know?
you never get enough?
look, what do you want from me? I like seeing how they spin it, you know?
you think anybody really knows how any of this stuff happens?
definitely not.
I know that when I was in high school,
I was so... uh, angst-ridden.
Yeah. But I mean, you didn't shoot anybody.
no, but there were days when I wanted to do, you know, real...real damage to... to you.
to me?
Hey, buddy, take your best shot.
come on.
wait, I'll help you out, I'll get on my knees.
come on.
I'm not a kid anymore. - All right. Tough guy, let's go.
maybe we should step outside. - All right.
let's go. - How about now?
come on.
you ain't got nothing. - All right, all right.
how about we just get pizza?
no, I don't want to go out, man, I just got home.
there's a lovely pot roast in the fridge.
it's a week old. Come on.
how do you know that? - Of course.
you eat here more than I do. - I'll pay, how's that?
nice shooting.
Hey. Robin brooks, look at you.
what's going on? I didn't think U. S. Attorneys were allowed to get their hands dirty.
well, you can't prosecute what you don't understand, right?
wow, look at that. That's a lot of gun, huh?
Yeah, well, it gives me a chance to actually hit something.
look, I didn't get a chance to thank you after the Jon Owens case.
Ah, that's all right.
no, your team handled it all really low-key, and because of that I was able to go forward with my gang case.
good. I'm glad it worked out. -Yeah.
so, do you always hang out at the gun range alone on a Friday night?
well, clearly it's where all the pretty girls show up.
agent Eppes, I don't think I've been hit on at a gun range before.
what?
Yeah. I'm on my way. Right.
what's wrong? -I got to go.
are you okay? -Yeah. I got to get out of here.
okay.
I'll talk to you later. -Bye.
ATF agent Nikki Davis.
killed herself two hours ago. Gunshot to the head.
who made the 911 call?
LAPD uniform involved in an unrelated foot pursuit heard what appeared to be a gunshot.
agent Turner. Bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms.
look, I know any death involving a federal officer is technically the FBI's, but she was one of ours.
so, I'd like the handle on this.
agent Eppes?
look, just... I want her covered as soon as possible. You got it?
I said ATF wants the investigation. Well, we're taking it.
I'll keep you in the loop.
we all use math every day, to predict weather, to tell time, to handle money.
math is more than formulas and equations.
it's logic...
rationality.
it's using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.
Nikki may have been ATF, but I want her treated like one of our own.
our responsibility is to clear the death of any federal officer, right?
you're not handing this over? -No.
how we doing on ballistics?
single round, matches her duty weapon, a sig Sauer 229.
tox screen?
oxycontin and prozac.
Prozac?
Yeah. It's not that unusual for a suicide victim.
any word on the husband? -He's an ATF agent.
what?
works fugitive gun runners. On his way back from Texas as we speak.
I want him interviewed as soon as he lands, all right?
so, I'm just wondering if this woman's death was a suicide, why all the intensity?
she's the third agent in two years who killed themselves.
so it's strictly professional?
you knew her, didn't you?
does say "behaviorist" on my job description.
Yes, I knew her.
well, if you ever want to talk, I'm number two on your Nextel.
Thanks.
I'm going to head over to the ATF and interview her whole team now.
Hi, Charlie. -Hey.
take care of your brother in there.
What'd she mean by that? -Nothing.
looks like an ATF agent who I knew pretty well killed herself, that's all.
Oh. I'm really sorry.
Yeah. Do you remember that kid who jumped off the bridge last year?
Yeah. Finn Montgomery.
it looked like a suicide, but you didn't think so, right?
right. I didn't think he was capable of it.
and why?
his potential was unlimited.
good more than outweighed the bad.
but I was wrong.
well, do me a favor, take a look at this file.
just tell me if there's something doesn't add up, would you?
sure.
it isn't his life Charlie's taking stock of.
okay, well, even easier still.
a hundred people commit suicide every hour.
and 300 stars die every second.
Yeah, this was a person. Nikki Davis-- she was an ATF agent.
so, what, you're weighing events in her life to determine the likelihood of her suicide?
I'm applying a modified holmes-rahe stress test as a starting point.
we're assigning numerical values to certain events in her life.
Yeah, but how do you rank such things?
I mean, Christmas alone, dinner with your in-laws could equal a death in the family.
I mean, depending on your in-laws.
Oh, she was a par golfer, ran sub-three-hour marathon times, and even worked at the local boys and girls club. All positive things.
Yeah, and she was also on antidepressants. What, they're handing out guns to the clinically depressed?
depression is a definite negative.
but my cognitive emergence studies have taught me that it's difficult, but not entirely impossible, to quantify the variables that describe existing human consciousness.
and Don has asked you to work on this? Why?
he knew her.
Yeah, he knew her, a long time ago.
they hadn't spoken in years, but I think he's really bothered by this.
Yeah, well, like I said, leads me back to those stars.
one dies and disappears, and the whole cluster feels the loss.
ATF! Search warrant!
ATF!
drop the gun! Drop it!
took a little time there, didn't you?
nice, guys. Hey.
this is agent reeves and sinclair they're clearing the inquiry on Nikki's death.
sorry for your loss.
fingernails so clean, he's got to be FBI.
they're here to help, agent Rho. So are you.
Nikki was our leader, we lost her. What else do you need to know?
we'd like to know whether she seemed depressed at all.
was something bothering her more than usual?
Nikki always had a lot on her mind. Goes with the territory.
we found some medications on her bureau-- pain killers, antidepressants.
is that what this is about? Some kind of FBI thing to try and drag her name through the mud?
we're just trying to investigate.
Yeah, well, I know all about these kinds of investigations. And you can count me out.
agent Wilson.
look, she's upset, all right? We all are.
we understand that. We're just trying to sort some things out.
Nikki hurt herself pretty bad last year.
on the job?
executing a warrant. Messed up her knee real bad.
never took the time to heal right.
no rest for the wicked, she used to say.
agent Rho...
if you think of something, just let us know.
you need anything else? -We'll be in touch.
just give me a second.
you know, you'll get more power in your punch if you turn your foot into it.
a lot of people think we should still be sitting behind a desk.
must have been nice having a female boss.
did you know she was self-medicating?
we were working a pretty heavy bank robbery crew.
maybe she was a little off, maybe the stress was getting to her. I don't know.
wouldn't you say taking your own life was more than being a little off?
I got a job to do here. I have to ask somebody these questions.
she was having problems at home.
with her husband?
two ATF agents maintaining a relationship isn't exactly the easiest thing to do in our business.
got it. How serious were the problems?
pretty serious, I think.
something he did backed her into a corner. I don't know what it was, but she said she was thinking of calling it quits with him.
they don't call it eating your gun for nothing, do they?
I don't know if you're going to want to hear this, but after talking to Nikki Davis's team,
I do believe that she killed herself.
I'm not as convinced.
I've been looking through her file.
agent Davis was a leader in her community, she was an outstanding agent.
who was suffering from a bad depression.
true, but look.
commendation after commendation. She just made supervisor.
strong parental support and siblings.
all of this should have outweighed any transitory depression.
here, look, figure skaters, when they perform a routine, the judges multiply the scores on the jumps by a difficulty factor.
if that difficulty factor's large enough, and even with the mistakes and the subsequent deductions, skaters can still win the competition.
all the positive aspects of Nikki Davis's life should have multiplied her natural coping ability.
and so I think we should look at this further.
Charlie, look, if I'm going to rule her death a homicide, I need more than skating metaphors, you know?
I need evidence. -We might have it.
Nikki's husband's flight from Texas arrived, only he wasn't on it.
what do you mean? -I checked the manifest.
he never got on the plane.
found out his wife's dead and he didn't come home?
ran a trace on his cell.
what's five-two? Mexico?
night of her death he was in Mexico city, not in Texas like he was supposed to be.
also, I ran a trace on her cell, all calls in the last 48 hours.
Yeah, and?
one number pops out; it's on page two.
last person she called was you, Don.
I rechecked everyone's voice mail. She didn't leave a message.
I mean, I don't hear from her for years, and then she calls me a few hours before she kills herself?
well, maybe the kind of message she was leaving, she didn't want to put on an answering machine.
and what's her husband doing in Mexico?
credit cards show he made a bunch of trips down there, all to the same town, just south of the border.
he's working gun runners. Maybe it's an undercover assignment.
no. Not according to Turner. I mean, they thought he was working a case in Texas.
and if he is on the job, why is he putting it on his own dime? I mean, especially with his financial situation.
what? What's that?
credit report shows he took a second mortgage out on his house.
Yeah, about six months ago, he started borrowing against his pension.
for what?
I don't know, but whatever he's buying down there, no, he's not using the credit card for it.
well, I'll say this for him. The man gets results.
one bust alone last year netted two crates of m-16s.
look, just keep digging, all right? I mean, I want to know what the guy was doing in Mexico, okay?
all right.
Hey.
Hey.
I can't remember the last time I saw you just taking a break.
Oh, it's a beautiful day.
I needed to get outside.
Yeah. Larry says that you've been distracted.
it's the ATF agent?
well, my research has revealed that law enforcement officers are more likely to commit suicide than civilians.
well, it's not really surprising, is it?
I mean, they're around violence every day.
they see things most of us don't even know exist.
they also have a terrible track record at maintaining relationships.
Yeah. My parents had a friend. He was a detective, and, um, well, the last time I checked, he was on his third wife.
Really?
he was always getting called off in the middle of the night.
he missed her science fair, her school play.
everything, really.
I worry about Don.
where his work takes him, how's he ever gonna have a relationship?
what?
nothing.
it's just, I mean, we both know that you're not exactly the most successful man in the world when it comes to maintaining a personal relationship.
different. -How?
and Don has made his work his life. So have you.
what's even worse is, you've made his work your life.
look who's talking.
look, we all have professional commitments.
but that doesn't mean we're not responsible for the choices we make.
nothing is written in stone, Charlie.
don can find somebody. I mean, he just has to be willing to.
looking for evidence or a keepsake?
we've been looking all over for you.
my boss told me.
said you were handling the investigation. -Yeah, well, that's right.
looks like, uh...
you and Nikki had a lot of fun in new Mexico.
Yeah, well, you know, it was a long time ago.
and you decided to handle her suicide, what, for old time's sake?
she called me a few hours before she died.
called you?
about what? -I don't know, Richard.
Why's your boss thinks you were in Texas?
well, I don't think that's really any of your concern.
well, you're wrong about that.
I mean, you're in debt up to your eyeballs. What are you doing running around in Mexico?
what are you doing, Eppes?
I'm just doing my job here, man, that's all I'm doing.
no, you're not. You're trying to clear your conscience.
you left Nikki. -Yes. So?
well, it took her a long time to get over that, you know? It hurt her pretty bad.
look, let-let's just talk about Mexico.
they sell drugs there. -Uh-huh. So, what, you got a problem?
the drugs weren't for me.
I saw her tox screen. The only thing in her system were prescription drugs, so...
well, they were experimental. Non-FDA approved.
what does that mean?
Nikki had cancer.
what?
she was diagnosed about a year ago.
Hey, look, you know, um, I didn't know.
I mean, it's, it's not in her file, so...
that's because we didn't tell anybody. ATF-- they, um...
they would have put her on leave for sure, and Nikki...
wanted to keep working.
if you don't believe me, wait for the autopsy.
all right, just no more trips to Mexico, okay? Until this is over, all right?
no more trips?
no more trips?!
how about just, um...
how about just a simple "I'm sorry for your loss, and I think I'll be on my way"?
like this whole thing isn't weird enough, he runs into the husband in her bedroom.
what was he doing at a crime scene alone?
here's the other info from the scene. -Thank you.
Hey, Charlie. -Hey.
I thought I'd stop by, check up on my brother.
well, he'll be back in a few minutes.
is this the radio communication from that night?
Yeah.
radio communication?
Yeah. Some uniforms were chasing a dealer.
they called in for backup and think they heard a gunshot.
are you saying that this is a recording of the gunshot that killed Nikki Davis?
maybe. It's pretty distorted. There's a whole lot of other noises on there.
how does this help?
well, if it is the actual gunshot, it'll tell us the exact time of death.
well, then, I can create an acoustic fingerprint for this shooting.
from the CD? -Yeah.
Yeah, we... look, we know where the shot was fired, right?
and assuming that the sound was picked up by more than one radio, and that I can have access to that same firearm, well, then, well, then, yeah. I can... I can recreate the same variables.
I'll make you a copy.
well, she's cute.
where was this taken?
new Mexico.
why is it whenever I see an old photo of myself, I look totally different, and you look absolutely the same? I mean, we-we have the same genes, don't we?
I don't understand it.
Yeah, well, she's dead.
she's dead?
apparently a suicide.
I'm sorry.
you know, she called me a few hours before.
why would she call you?
I don't know.
is there anything I can do?
she had cancer. -Cancer?
I see.
you know, I just...I have a hard time getting my head around the fact that she couldn't find some other way to...
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I guess you would, right?
did you and mom ever talk about what would happen...?
I never wanted to.
I guess we were just lucky it never came to that, but...
I mean, if she had chosen to, I would have understood.
and I never would have blamed myself.
you understand what I just said?
do you? -Yeah.
I got to get...
see you later, pop.
Yeah, all right.
no.
no, it still doesn't match. Are you sure we set up these outside microphones correctly?
double-checked them. -Because nothing can be discounted here.
you know, an experiment like this, there's such an extremely high level of difficulty.
why is that?
because there was an open window, the sound envelope and how the waves reached the microphones,
they require truly complex calculations.
in an auditory sense, a gunshot is fairly unique, in that it produces a short, intense sound impulse.
and how exactly does this help me with a timeline?
well, if we can recreate the original acoustic fingerprint, then we can match it to the sound recorded by three separate lapd officers.
you know, forensic acoustic experts did this exact same thing in the JFK assassination inquiry to determine whether or not there really was a gunman on that grassy knoll.
now, are we sure everything's exactly the same as it was?
Yeah.
Hey, it just occurred to me. That shade-- was it open or shut?
does it matter?
cloth doesn't reflect as much sound as glass.
look, as we fire our test shots, this program will measure muzzle blast and echo pattern, so it is essential to get an acoustic match that nothing in this room be changed, added to or eliminated.
tell, you what, let's... let's just try it again?
okay.
ready? -Yeah, go for it.
not even close.
all right, now, just throwing it out there.
maybe it wasn't a gunshot. -No, it was a gunshot.
listen, the recorded waveform was bouncing around much more.
something is missing here.
are you sure that there wasn't some evidence removed from this bedroom?
a shell casing maybe. And the bed sheet, that's it.
no, that's just fabric to fabric. According to my variations, we're looking for something much larger.
okay, her body, but if I understand correctly, that's why I'm in the room firing from the bed, right?
wait. David, where's don?
at the office.
sound waves.
a gunshot produces a sound wave that travels, okay?
if the wave hits a reflective substance, let's say like rock, the air pressure energy of the wave moves back in the opposite direction towards you.
an echo? -Exactly, but those returning sound waves don't just allow us to hear the gunshot.
they tell us what we can't see. Like bats, for example.
a bat emits a sound wave and then listens carefully to the echo it produces.
now, by hearing how long it takes for the echo to return, the bat's brain automatically knows how far away an animal is.
the larger the animal, the louder the echo.
if am animal is moving toward or away from the bat, the pitch of the echo will be raised or lowered accordingly.
it's the Doppler effect.
all right. Yeah, so? And?
and we recreated the acoustics of Nikki Davis's room using the same communication system the officers used, and we found that there was something missing.
missing? -Actually, someone.
I think that there was someone else in that room when Nikki Davis died.
all right, wait, wait. Are you sure about this?
the acoustic pattern clearly shows extra movement and mass.
don, I'm telling you, there was someone else in the room.
it can't be Nikki's husband; we know he was in Mexico.
doesn't mean he couldn't have helped plan his wife's murder, though.
all right, here we go, I want to start over, all right? We're going to comb his file, hers.
I want to find anyone with potential for this.
people with a grudge against Nikki is going to be a long list, Don.
that's all right. -We've got informants, -people she's put behind bars. -Just tell me, his file's on this table?
right here. -This his?
Yeah.
uh, wait a second.
based on what I see here, I can help narrow that list down a little.
why, what do you mean? What's this?
the forensics report. -We've already been through that, Charlie.
right, well, DNA samples were taken from Nikki Davis's house.
a few dozen, actually. It's a house, Charlie, anybody going in could have left a trace.
we have hair, fiber, skin, fingerprints.
that's exactly my point.
Charlie, we ran the samples, there was no matches.
Yeah, and without a suspect, it doesn't even help us.
you guys are talking biology, I'm talking probability.
look, 99. 99% of our DNA is the same.
but that doesn't mean we can't find markers that differentiate one individual from another.
like genes associated with a particular trait.
that's exactly right. For example, we can with high accuracy determine an individual's origin:
european, East African, sub-Saharan african.
fine. How does this help us?
Cal Sci has a DNA database.
50, 000 DNA samples, and the photos of the people who donated them.
I can run a statistical matrix to find similarities between the samples found at Nikki's house and the samples at Cal Sci.
wait a minute, are you saying you can tell us what these DNA samples would actually look like?
to a reasonable probability.
well, go for it, run it.
all right. So, the last six months, Nikki's primary focus is investigating a series of armed robberies.
five months, five jobs, $1. 5 million.
guys move with tactical precision.
what was ATF doing on that case?
agent Rho said the crew used military-quality weapons.
maybe ATF's handling the trace.
was she having any luck?
she had an informant who linked these guys to an Aryan motorcycle gang:
the outlaw renegades.
it's run by a guy named Roy Mitchell.
looks like she put surveillance on the gang based on information from the informant.
anything come of it?
her team spotted the outlaw renegades outside a bank, then ATF waited on these guys.
how come there were no arrests made?
they never went inside the bank.
someone tipped these guys off.
right, they knew they were being watched, that's why they didn't go inside.
maybe the informant was playing both sides.
isolating a person from DNA linked to a government database?
I can't help but wonder, is this even ethical?
Oh, it's no different than fingerprints or driver licenses.
listen, I see a very real distinction.
driver licenses provide a person's identity, but DNA, that contains the essence of our history, glimpses into our genetic future.
I'm merely using DNA information that's already been collected to approximate the genetic description of an ATF agent's killer.
Oh, I agree, in this case, you know, the intentions is pure, it's admirable, even.
but, you know, DNA can be used for much less noble pursuits.
I mean, predetermination, Charles.
think about it, once we're trapped within these databases, our employers, our insurance companies, you know, they can use our genetic codes, and not to glimpse our futures, but to limit them.
agent Eppes. Nice to see you.
Robin, I need a favor. -Really? Oh, you could have just called.
Oh, right, but I forgot, apparently you don't know how to do that.
no, no, no, listen to me, it was a friend of mine, okay? An agent, an ATF agent was killed and, uh...
I mean, that's the only reason I took off.
wow, I feel really silly. -No, don't, please.
how can I help?
well, she was working with an informant who was giving her Intel about the outlaw renegades.
Yeah, I know them, our office has wiretaps on them.
well, I figure the warrants are based on those tips. I need to know who it is.
those wiretap applications are sealed by court order.
look, the ATF isn't going to help me because I took the investigation away from them, so...
well, it's not my case.
but I'll talk to the Ausa that's handling it, and... see what I can find out.
all right. I appreciate that.
this woman was close to you?
you know what? I'm sorry, that is none of my business.
it's all right. You know, I'll tell you about it.
all right. Well, you know where I work, right? -Yeah. Thanks.
he's an outlaw renegade, right? -Yeah.
Nikki arrested him last year?
Yeah, she flipped him, he's been giving Intel to the U. S. Attorney's office.
he lives alone, doesn't he?
two cars in the driveway.
FBI! Looking for Darryl Clark!
I'll take the back.
we get it. He's been dead for a while.
guys? Out back.
it's Nikki Davis's husband. Two shots, center mass.
he wasn't just killed, he was executed.
all right, so we know Nikki's source was giving her Intel on the renegades, right?
right, they must have found out he was a rat and they took him out.
Yeah, but what about the husband? Why kill him?
Yeah, and what's he even doing there? He's probably following the same trail we were.
he wanted to know if the informant was playing both sides, if he betrayed her.
what, he went to avenge the wife's death, right?
you know, Annie Wilson, the girl on Nikki's team, told me their marriage was in trouble.
she said something, uh...
something the husband did backed her into a corner.
you think he could have been involved?
well, the guns the robbery crew uses are military grade.
and Davis definitely had access to those.
now, he recovered those assault rifles in that bust last year.
right, and they're in financial trouble from the wife's illness.
maybe he thought selling the guns would help her.
Nikki finds out, she has no one else to turn to... then she calls you.
and gets killed before she has a chance to do it again.
exactly.
all right, so I want 24/7 surveillance on everyone in this photo.
and this guy, Mitchell, pops out of his hole, I want to know it.
Hello? -Oh, hey.
am I interrupting something?
just another Flein Hart doomsday prophecy.
come on, you make me sound like chicken little.
I was merely advising Charles as to the dangers of unleashing a genie from a bottle.
he's thrilled with the idea of cataloging DNA.
well, why, Larry, do you have something to hide?
no, my DNA is pure as the driven snow.
then what's the problem?
the problem is, once something is out of the bottle, it is out of the bottle for all time.
the bottle? -What? The bottle.
that's a useful metaphor.
right. Listen up.
I've identified several groups of genetic markers called haplotypes, and now I need a set of algorithms to compare them against the bio department's photo base.
and these algorithms can help you identify the people who left traces of DNA in this agent's house?
like a blueprint for a home.
the DNA that builds a person is like the blueprints that build tract houses.
a majority of the characteristics of each home-- roof, dimensions and style
is exactly the same, but there are a small number of things, like color, landscaping and, say, window coverings, that makes each home-- like a person-- unique.
with a little luck, I may be able to put a statistical face on all of Don's samples.
it's like some "Bizarro" DNA world.
when I was at Quantico, I remember all this talk about pride and integrity...
I remember holding John Dillinger's gun.
Yeah, but they never seemed to tell you about cases like this.
I mean, here's my friend and...
I mean, she's murdered, you know, she's miserable...
she's in yet another bad relationship.
come on, Donnie, you're projecting now, aren't you?
no, I don't think so. I mean, I don't know anyone in my game who's got a really good relationship.
Donnie, that can't be true.
well, it is. I mean, I tell you stuff, but you don't know the half of it, trust me.
how come I don't find that comforting? -It's hard.
you come home and someone says, "How was your day?"
and you're like, "well, I saw a decapitated kid, how was yours?
well, I mean, if you can't talk about it, how are you going to feel any better than you do now?
which is why there is nobody at home waiting for you.
look, even when I could have had good relationships, I screwed them up.
what does that mean, damned if you do, and damned if you don't?
Yeah.
what if you didn't sabotage your next relationship?
yeah? What does that mean?
I mean, what if you gave the next woman that you meet a real shot?
look, dad, it's easier said than done...
Donnie, what's the worst that can happen?
I'll tell you. The relationship fails, right?
so then what? Then you're back where you are right now.
but the only difference is, instead of being afraid, you took a chance.
LAPD undercover just bought some dope about an hour ago.
it'd Roy Mitchell, leader of the outlaw renegades, on the couch.
how many inside? -Two plus Mitchell.
we'll come through the backyard, take them by surprise.
what do you say, boys, let's do it.
drop your weapon.
Hey! We got a runner!
FBI! Don't move!
you got nothing on me. -Well, how about two dead federal agents?
which qualifies you for special circumstances and a lethal injection.
Yeah, you have any evidence?
what, you mean like Nikki Davis' husband supping you guys with guns?
is that what we're talking about? -Who's Nikki Davis?
she was the ATF agent working Darryl Clark. You know who that is, right?
Yeah, he was cooperating with the ATF. Did you know that?
Ah, can't trust anybody nowadays, can you?
you killed him. Just like you killed Richard Davis when he showed up.
sorry. Not ringing any bells.
look, you got one chance, you hear me? One chance to save your life.
all right, look, you guys got pictures of me killing somebody, feel free to let me know.
other than that, we got nothing to talk about.
don, he's right. What we have isn't enough to flip him.
well, he's involved, all right. There's no doubt in my mind he's involved.
I can't hold him. -Well, you can't cut him loose.
we don't have probable cause. Nothing ties him to either crime scene.
look, I'll lose his paperwork, all right? I cannot let the guy go, Robin!
look, Don, I don't know what this woman meant to you, but I doubt that she would want you to compromise yourself.
neither do I.
we'll put him under surveillance. Eventually, he's gonna make a mistake.
that's not good enough, Megan. I'm sorry, it's not.
don! I got your guys.
or your guy. Or whatever. I got 'em.
what? -Your DNA samples.
I was looking for major continental groups and searching for matches.
it's actually something that Larry said.
that I shouldn't be looking at specific physical characteristics,
I should be adjusting my algorithm to identify origins.
so, I went back to the Cal Sci's DNA database and I found samples that most closely resembled the biogeographical ancestry of the eight DNA samples that were pulled from Nikki Davis's house.
and I approximated the genetic probability of the samples' likeness.
okay, how do we know which one's the killer, Charlie?
we don't--well, not for certain. But we can apply probabilities.
I mean, look, we know that there were no fingerprints on that gun, so we can assume that the killer wore gloves.
so we can eliminate all secretion-based DNA samples from hands.
what, we get these three?
wait a minute. -What is it, David?
one of these representations.
does this remind you of someone?
agent rho from Nikki's team?
Yeah, that's pretty close.
but why would someone on Nikki's team want her dead?
bank robbery detail described them as moving with military precision, right?
Yeah, and Rho was a former navy seal.
Mitchell wasn't leading this crew, it was Rho's.
call special ops; I want Rho under tight surveillance asap.
ATF has Rho out on a training scenario. The location's undisclosed.
they're pulling a job, I know it. They're pulling a job.
stop! that's good.
get 'em up, now!
fire in the hole!
no, don't shoot!
shoot him!
damn it, feds are on to us! Give me suppression fire!
protect our flank!
cover me! Watch for crossfire!
don't do it! Don't even think about it! Get that hand up! Get it up!
Oh, thank you.
okay, pizza's here.
peppers and onions?
uh, no, sausage.
don's not coming over?
I called; immediately goes to voice mail.
what?
what? -Three agents cracked, dad,
her husband and Agent Rho.
I mean, even his crimes can be traced to the pressure he was under.
what do you think, Don's going to crack?
he lives alone, and there are times we don't see him for days.
who knows what he's doing?
Charlie, there's one thing I know about your brother: he always knows how to have a good time.
what?
you're not seriously worried, are you?
that formula I was working on,
I ran it against his life.
you know, you're worse than me. You realize that?
he's going to be okay.
Yeah, well, I knew that a long time ago.
most compelling reason:
strong ties to his family.
and apparently, they to him, right?
still, you ever wonder where he disappears to.
he doesn't disappear. He's, uh...
turns his cell phone off.
Oh, all right, so he disappears.
he's going to be fine.
he's going to be fine.
agent Eppes.
counselor.
this is a surprise.
Yeah.
come on, almost got it.
come on, there's got a be a better signal in here.
okay, stop.
any minute now.
there's lots of unsecured networks around.
find something quick-- let's get out of here.
Yes, got one.
okay, we're in.
bombs away.
look at all the bank accounts.
passenger: Weren't you watching to see if anyone was following?!
I have to get rid of this laptop.
don't move!
david: FBI! Hey!
don't move!
take him, we'll get the driver!
COLBY: Do not run!
get out of the way, get out of the way!
don: Hey!
don't move!
put your hands behind your back, thumbs up.
I didn't do anything wrong.
yeah? What are you doing driving around jacking networks?
or trying, till you jacked an FBI signal.
Alan: What is, uh, fishing, as it refers to computer hacking?
well, it's spelled with p-h, and it's when people send out fake e-mails made to look like real e-mails from banks and financial companies and then ask people for personal account information.
and some people are dumb enough to give it to them?
don: Yeah, they send out between 75 and 150 million of the things a day.
five percent respond.
so that's 3 to 7 million people daily, to the tune of $500 million a year.
all right, those are scary statistics.
don: Dinner.
Charlie: These guys they caught today stole two million bucks in three months.
come on in, put it right there. You're kidding.
okay. ALAN: Hope it's not meatballs.
excuse me.
I just want to check things out.
that's enough-- it's for everybody.
Yeah, it smells good.
uh, Mr. Eppes?
I'm sorry, the card you called the delivery on with was declined.
all right, hold on, try this one.
you know what? Let me get it. No, no, I got it.
I owe you.
that's so weird.
I just paid that.
you don't owe me, you know.
all I did was set up an amplified wi-fi signal.
any of your FBI techs could done that.
Hey, Charlie, these are busy people, you know?
I would have had to wait-- I appreciate it.
all right. You sure? Yeah, everything's here.
um, this card was declined, too.
you might want to call your bank.
what, are you kidding me?
no. That's weird.
wait a minute, give me one second. Here you go.
no, Dad, please, please. You have to get this figured out.
here. How much is that?- Just give me a second here.
um, $65. 35.
you can keep all that.
thank you.
Charlie: Dad, I think that's yours, 'cause I would never eat something like that.
I mean, that's ridiculous.
you know what?
it's probably some glitch in the restaurant's computer.
what's up?
the bank's saying my accounts are empty.
get out of here. Your checking account?
everything.
don: No, I didn't take all my money out.
your system was hacked.
because I'm an FBI agent!
they sent out 4, 000 phishing e-mails.
within hours, they had a few hundred people sending in account information.
Hey.
well, they weren't sending e-mails indiscriminately.
they weren't chumming, they were working off a particular list of bank customers.
don: And do we know what kind of customers?
those with large balances and low activity, mostly seniors.
right, 'cause they respond.
boy, they got into the bank's confidential database.
you know, that's not easy.
right.
thing is, it wasn't our idea.
whose idea was it?
I... We can't tell you.
MEGAN: You sure about that?
you're in some serious trouble here.
I've got a clean record, first-time offender.
what's the worst I'll get, probation?
you know, there's this thing called the Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act.
and convictions for aggravated identity theft, including phishing, get a mandatory two year prison sentence.
and then I throw in wire fraud, and you're looking at 15 to 20 years.
you're not gonna get out of jail till you're hitting your midlife crisis.
my girlfriend, she's... she's gonna leave me
she's gonna leave me if she finds out I got arrested.
man 2: It wasn't even our idea.
we were working for these guys.
david: What guys?
we met them at a cybercafe-- two Russians.
we'd been hacking into secure systems, screwing with people's credit cards.
they found out, said if we didn't cut them in, they would report us to the cops.
what were their names?
Len and Alex.
that's all we got.
man: They talked about this Yuri guy.
I think he was their boss.
and the phishing was their idea?
Yeah. Yeah... Yeah...
they took the money we made.
gave us like a thousand for each run.
david: So why'd you keep working for them?
dude, like I said, this Yuri guy doesn't let you just stop.
if we tried to stop, we were dead.
these guys were working for Russians?
I mean, come on, are we buying this?
no, it's a classic Russian mob scheme.
they hang out at cybercafes, check cashing operations, looking for people pulling off scams.
MEGAN: Yeah, and then force them to work for them with threats and blackmail.
all right, I'll call the organized crime task force, see if they have anything.
no need to call.
Hey, Lieutenant Walker.
Hey, Gary.
FBI report hit my desk, flagged it as a probable Russian syndicate operation.
don: Yeah, well, the suspect said the people they worked for spoke Russian.
threatened to kill them if they didn't cooperate.
that's no empty threat-- you know the saying about the Russian mob? What's that?
they'll shoot you just to see if the gun works.
Oh, great. Come on, let's see what you got.
so how did this get your attention?
LAPD's got several cases involving a guy named Yuri Koverchenko.
I've been after him for a couple of years, and it looked like one of his operations.
our suspects said they heard the name Yuri from people they've dealt with.
this is Yuri Koverchenko.
it's the best shot we have of him.
he's elusive, he's careful, he's rumored to be former KGB; we suspect him of setting up dozens of computer frauds, insurance scams,
medicare frauds.
so, mostly white collar stuff?
Yeah, but don't let that fool you-- he's brutal, linked to some eight murders within the past six months.
we busted a doctor who was part of a scam Koverchenko ran, and he was about to cut a deal.
they killed him, his wife, and his teenage daughter.
killed an entire family.
over an insurance scam.
Hey.
the bank reimburse you yet?
no, I got to prove somehow
I didn't withdraw the money myself.
maybe we should remind them who investigates bank robberies.
Yeah. Well, look, I figure we got two ways to chase this thing down, right? Find who stole your money, find out where the phishers are that got the prime list of bank customers, right? Yeah.
Yeah, but why go after my brother personally?
well, that really doesn't make sense.
Walker said that Yuri usually keeps a low profile, and this seems like a play to get the FBI's attention.
Yeah, well, it worked.
Hey. Hey.
so I'm making progress on finding out what happened to Don's account, but it's scary-- you can hit a few keys and wipe out a life savings.
well, still, banks are safer than keeping your cash under a mattress.
Hey, I'm all for giving up wealth and material possessions.
mm, living like a monk?
no, like a grad student.
but, you know, I think.
I've found the original attack.
an unauthorized access into the database of Don's bank.
hmm. Can you tell me how they were able to break the encryption?
well, the bank used a standard encryption method that was easy and cheap, but it was vulnerable to attacks.
well, then, trace back to the hacker.
well, I can try, Charlie, but the Internet's real-time.
I mean, after some of these malicious events, there's nothing left to trace.
aren't there any techniques we can employ here?
Yeah, there's Hop-by-Hop or ICMP or this thing called backscatter, but they all have to be done while the attack is happening.
right. Right.
the Internet's a river of information.
tracing back to the source of an Internet attack-- well, that's like trying to trace back to the specific source of water in a river.
you can only find the source of an Internet attack if there's a data flow to follow.
but without the data source...
then we can't trace it back.
the hacker would have to attack again in order for us to locate him.
has there been any current activity in Don's account?
Yeah, there's this one persistent ad bot.
spyware.
it pops up all over the Internet.
it's used to monitor what sites people click on.
could be that it's a plant, a plant to find out if Don's account has been reimbursed, so the hacker can just hit him again.
Oh... by the way,
Larry called from his string theory conference.
uh, he was confused about something.
what, his double special relativity theory? No.
whether he was in St. Louis or Cleveland.
where is his conference?
Minneapolis.
banker: We send warnings about phishing with every monthlystatement, but too many customers still fall for it.
who has access to the customer files?
I'm the senior security officer here at Pacific Mutual, so in the tech section, the files can only be accessed by me and my tech security team.
this is Lamont, and that's Colleen.
Hi. Hi.
Hi.
all right, well, uh, our people will want to take a look at your system here.
good, I've just found suspicious code runs in certain transactions I think you guys should look at.
and I've cross-referenced every unauthorized entry that's taken place in the last 24 months.
thank you. That's a really good start. - Sure.
what month are you? - Oh, seventh.
Oh, yeah? Congratulations.
thank you.
all right, well,
I still want to take a look at their personnel files
fingerprints, the whole deal, all right?
look, I know you guys need to consider the possibility of an inside job, but I worked with Colleen for eight years, and Lamont for four.
I know them, they're my team.
we're going to need your file and prints, too.
okay.
uh, excuse me.
agent Eppes, I get all fraud bulletins for this region, so I know your account was hacked into. Mm-hmm.
if you like, I could call the security officer at your bank, explain your connection with this case.
maybe you get your money back faster.
how could that have happened?
our two phishers, Smith and Whitley-- they made bail.
they're gone. What?!
I told them to call me if these guys made bail.
I told them.
jail computer records show you were contacted.
I wasn't.
so, they hacked into the bail system?
this is Koverchenko's MO.
shot twice in the head, dumped out with the garbage by the river.
that's Daniel Smith's girlfriend.
she picked them both up from the holding center.
he's sending a message that he can get to anybody,
a man I. D.'d as Ned Spope put up the bail money, paid with a fake credit card.
number was stolen-- that number belonged to Don Eppes.
don told me that he cancelled all his credit cards.
bondsman thought he was using a secure Web site to verify the account, but his system was hacked.
web site was a fake.
and that name.
it's an anagram.
so they used his card, his name, and they bailed out his suspects.
why are they making this about Don?
I don't know, but there's one more thing to consider.
Yuri Koverchenko just lost two workers.
he's just going to find more, and kill them.
Yeah, unless we stop him.
Hey, Charlie, could you check out my computer?
my Internet connection is running too... slow.
uh, yeah, we piggybacked your wireless to try to find the person who stole Don's money.
AMITA: Yeah, we set up a system using the power of several computers, to hopefully speed things up.
any luck?
it depends on if I'm right about the hackers monitoring Don's accounts.
you see, there's this technique called "backscatter which will trace back to the source of the hack.
Yeah, these computers are sending data back along all the routes that lead to the bank's database to find the source of the attack.
and if there's even a trickle of data flowing downstream, well, we can calculate its effects on the flow going upstream, find where it came from.
a computer runs through it.
I think we got something.
Charlie isolated the computer that cleaned out your account.
tracked it back to this address.
appears to be an illegal auto parts shop.
all, call the AUSA and get a phone warrant, all right?
this address is linked to an auto insurance scam run by the Russians-- could be Yuri Koverchenko.
well, good. He's got to screw up sometime, right?
and so there you have it, fresh from a real-world application
a new way of tracking Internet activity.
is this something you developed as an FBI application?
I've removed specifics from the incident,
you can still see the basic sequences we analyzed.
the FBI is using the information gained from this work to locate a person behind an unauthorized access of a computer database. Cool.
COLBY: Guys, just talked to the spotter.
indicated two main entries here and here.
they got microphones picking up four voices in one room.
no visual confirmation.
huh. Any idea what they're saying?
it's in Russian, but one of our guys speaks a little.
they were eating lunch and talking about their favorite reality shows.
things are about to get a lot more real for them in a hurry.
all right, let's do it, let's go, guys, let'roll.
Charlie: This is basic Internet sub routing and tracking codes.
what's the significance of that line of code?
actually, I don't know.
wasn't part of the original program.
looks like some sort of modular polynomial, doesn't it?
which can be easily restated as a string of numbers.
what's going on?
I don't know.
where are they? They were just here.
I don't want to over think this, but why?
why this line of numbers?
is W-E-R in Sloane's Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.
maybe it's simple alphabet cipher.
we're waiting for you"?!
I mean, what?
they couldn't have gotten far, right?
got to be somebody here someplace.
there's only two ways in, and we have 'em both covered.
starting to get a feeling I haven't had in a long time.
guys, get out of here! This thing is wired.
get down!
COLBY: Hang in there, buddy. Are you all right?
how many times you hit?
my shoulder. All right, just breathe deep.
they were totally waiting for us.
it was a damn trap.
all right, you're all right.
you're all right. Just take it easy, just breathe.
hang in, buddy. Come on...
Hey, how's David?
he's stable. There's not much damage.
yeah? Good. All right...
says to tell you he wants back ASAP, and that no, I can't have his desk.
all right, come on, I want to go over every detail of this and figure out what the hell happened.
I know what happened.
the Russian mob just went to war with the FBI.
Yeah, but why? And how did they know?
Charlie: It was a setup.
he laid a trap, and I walked you all right into it.
he used our backscatter search to create a SubVirt in our computers
a subversive virtual machine that ran underneath our operating systems.
he had complete control of the software
Amita and I were using.
what does that mean? It means we didn't find his computer.
he led us where he wanted us to go.
this is someone who's highly skilled in cutting-edge computer techniques and an advanced multi-step thinker.
great. And Yuri's got him working for him.
Charlie: He wiped out your accounts because he knew that the Bureau was using me as a resource, and that
I would use some high-end techniques to try to track him.
with that knowledge, he set his trap.
but why? That's the thing I can't figure.
I mean, what the hell is the guy's goal?
and why is he going after Don?
to try and answer that,
I want to try Multiplayer Game Theory, what I like to call Team Theory.
okay, it's used by corporations, and by the Pentagon.
it's like football.
each side tries to move the ball into their end zone and tries to prevent the other side from doing the same.
players play their roles and each side watches the other's players to predict their next move.
in football, we know the objective.
if I analyze their actions, we'll learn about the players, and about the coaches.
right, their goal.
wait a minute. You're equating the Russian mob with a football team?
when the New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick
when was asked why he was so successful, you know what he said? He said economics.
Oh. It's hard to argue with someone who's won three Super Bowls in the past four years.
just came from seeing your man Sinclair.
he's doing well. He's a...
he's a tough guy. Yeah, he is.
in your opinion, what do you think these guys are hoping to accomplish here?
it could be a power struggle within the mob.
one side setting us up to help take out the other, or...
that's it?
you know, Eppes, I-I really don't think that that is it.
they seem to be coming after you, you alone, and why they're doing that, I have no idea.
but in all my years working organized crime,
I've never seen anything quite like this.
I highly recommend taking extra precautions.
so, this isn't the end of it?
russian mob has shown us over and over again its willingness to make retributions personal.
they will come after the people that you work with, and the people closest to you.
so besides the hacker, how many players are on the other side?
that's an unknown variable.
we'll try our first approach with three
the Hacker, the Yuri character, and the third will be a super-category for all the others.
Hey.
AMITA: Hey. Hi.
Hey. I hope you have some new data; I could use some.
well, actually, no.
Charlie, there's been a change.
okay, what kind of change?
well, the Bureau wants a unit on this that's more familiar with the Russian mob.
because of the ambush?
you're being taken off this case because I missed something.
no, it's just, these things happen. It's nothing.
I've just now begun working on the team theory analysis.
well, I'm off it, so you're off it.
okay?
so please, do me a favor, pack this stuff up; I'm gonna send someone over to get it.
all right? I'll see you guys later.
something's wrong.
don just doesn't let cases go.
well, it sounds like the decision was made over his head.
he's way too calm about it.
what are you doing?
testing a theory.
woman: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Los Angeles.
Yes, I'm calling about the Whitley/Smith case.
I think I have some important information that relates to the case.
could you put me through to the lead agent?
hold, please.
that case is being handled by Don Eppes.
I can put you through to his voicemail.
he's still lead agent; I knew it.
why would he lie to you, Charlie?
I don't know.
but if he's still on the case, so am I.
morton: Why are you asking me about auto insurance scams?
I don't get how this is connected to my bank.
well, we're hoping there's something that stood out that you might remember.
no, nothing.
you're the only one here today?
sorry?
your team's not here.
Lamont's kid is sick.
and Colleen's working from home.
and have you had any more unauthorized transactions?
no, everything's back to normal.
all right.
Charlie: There are two ways to define functions, implicitly and explicitly.
let's switch gears, if we could.
I want to apply a little decision theory to a practical situation.
let's all say that we're in a crowded room, and we would like to contact the police as soon as possible.
how would we go about doing that?
call 911? Of course.
call 911.
or, if we know an FBI agent, like I do, we'll call him.
but we can't seem to get any clear signal, so...
so we send someone to find a campus security officer.
who'd like to see how fast they can find a campus security officer?
how about you four on the end-- one, two, three, four.
time yourselves.
bring the officer back here.
go.
what else? What other ideas?
sure.
you've never seen them before?
no.
they were in your office?
there were files on the floor-- my team theory work.
I mean, obviously, they want to know what you're working on.
my work at the house!
Yeah, everything looks okay here.
all this?
someone mind telling me what's going on?
have you seen anyone hanging around the house?
no. Should I have?
dad, when was the last time you smoked a cigarette?
1979
Alan: Explain how a mathematician ends up on a case involving the Russian mafia.
I told him to drop it!
you know he can't just drop that stuff!
Hey, I'm standing right here, okay?!
so talk to me.
now, you endangered yourself, and you endangered Dad!
well, you lied to me. Yeah, to protect you.
Alan: Just tell us what we should do
nothing! and Charlie and I will do it.
I don't want you to do anything, all right?
I got agents here 24/7.
I can still help you. Come on!
let me make this as clear as possible.
you're not working this anymore, you understand me?
you can't tell me what I can't do.
when it comes to the FBI, I certainly can!
and you're done, you hear me?
you're done.
Koverchenko's made another move to target you.
this time your family.
but we've got no forensics on either Charlie's office, or your house.
Ditto the auto shop.
we're compiling all LAPD files on new Russian mob scams, looking for any that might link to Koverchenko.
that sounds good.
look, I'm not exposing my brother or my family to any more of this.
doesn't matter, Eppes.
you don't choose who he comes after, he does.
he knows about Charlie, he knows about your father.
and you can't go back.
Yeah, well, hey, they want a war?
fine, we'll give them a war.
as soon as the security team is done sweeping the house,
I can let you guys back in.
we'll keep a few agents posted out front.
shouldn't you be home recuperating or something?
I wanted a piece of this, even if it means baby-sitting you guys.
baby-sitting.
we need more watching than half a dozen able-bodied agents could provide?
don doesn't want Charlie doing any more work on this case at all.
Oh, I see. He figures you could stop him?
you know, for a really nice guy, you've got two very stubborn kids.
they get that from their mother.
the only way you can change her mind was, you know, I can't really say, I couldn't manage it myself.
what's a nice mathematician like you doing in a garage like this?
beats me.
one minute, I'm analyzing computer codes, and the next, I'm under threat from the Russian Mafia.
this would be your cognitive emergence work, right?
Yeah, it is.
Why?
cause there's a section right there labeled "Yuri Koverchenko Game Theory," Charlie.
busted.
look, you can't expect me to stop thinking about this case.
and even if I didn't write anything down, it would still be in my mind, okay?
so I might as well write it down, so at least, you know, my process is more effective.
Alan: In other words, I'm gonna do it anyway, so let me do it right. That's right.
look, you better believe I'm on the brink of seeing it.
there's a pattern to everything Koverchenko's done, I can feel it.
you can feel it?
is that a math term?
before creating proofs, mathematicians often rely on intuition.
fine, I hope Don's intuition doesn't tell him I'm helping you do this.
Mr. Eppes, can I entice you into a game of air hockey?
sure, why not?
I'll play the winner.
david: Okay.
and I have to warn you, even with a gimp arm, I am deadly.
I'm not scared.
the old fake-out. That's right.
get them to think one way, go the other.
let's see if you can do it again.
I can do that every time.
one more then. That's it.
what's it?
look, I got to talk to Don.
don was very specific
you're not working with the FBI on this one at all.
you know what? The FBI's not the only game in town.
don: Hey. Hey.
got anything?
Yeah, I tried something a little unorthodox.
what's that?
I consulted a mathematician.
Gary, what the hell? I told you. Hey, he called me.
look, I don't care, it doesn't matter!
listen, Eppes, I've been working Russian mob scams since before you joined the Bureau.
and let me be clear, you cannot protect your brother by taking him off the case.
if Koverchenko wants him dead, he's gonna make sure he waits as he needs to.
what am I supposed to do, Gary?
once you got into it with Koverchenko, there's was only one way out-- you got to get Koverchenko.
now, when you first introduced me to Charlie, I thought you were a little cuckoo, but I learned something, and I think Charlie can help us.
you told me to take precautions. That's what I did.
I told you to take precautions, I didn't tell you to back off.
you got to go at this guy with everything you got.
you know, it should have been my choice!
okay.
in an attempt to define motive,
I was able to perform a posterior distribution, gain insight into the Russians' game theory.
right, English, please, Charlie, come on.
Koverchenko was trying to get to you.
he took your money, he bailed out suspects using your name, ambushed your team and threatened our family.
so you're saying this is about retribution?
no, no, it's about distraction.
a play that's designed to look like a whole other play.
so like in football, it's a reverse. CHARLIE: That's it precisely.
he wanted your focus off your investigation and onto him.
off-- so off the phishers?
exactly.
and I ran this scenario through my team theory analysis, and I found that all his moves fell into a pattern
a pattern that began the day you arrested these guys.
you're saying that there was something in that original investigation that Koverchenko doesn't want us to find?
logically, whatever Koverchenko was trying to distract you from seeing was right in front of you.
so what were your early leads?
MEGAN: Pacific Mutual Savings Bank.
the customers they phished came from its database.
and, Don, we were at Pacific Mutual the day the suspects were bailed out.
well, then...
whatever he doesn't want you to see is at that bank.
get in. Please, wait!
get in now! Shut up and get in the truck!
okay, okay.
I did everything you asked.
I didn't tell the FBI anything.
walker: We know.
but it's time to start.
Y-????? _ X[6 What's going on?
your employees aren't home with sick kids or working out of the house.
we know they were kidnapped, and they're going to kill them if you don't do everything they say, right?
now, we picked you up in a blind spot, okay?
so nobody knows where you are-- nobody.
no, I'm sorry, I cannot help you.
you don't really have a choice there, Sam.
lamont and Colleen, they'll die.
I don't have family in California, but they do.
right. All right, money's not important to me, my job doesn't matter, but their lives matter.
and let me tell you something
if you do everything they want,
they might-- might-- leave their children alone.
we're your only chance, we're their only chance.
somehow I'm getting the feeling that I'm your only chance.
they wiped out your finances, they've gunned down your agents, they killed your eyewitnesses.
God knows what else they've threatened you with.
answer one question for me. All right.
are you scared of them?
Yeah.
you bet your ass I'm scared of them.
but that's not going to stop me.
all right.
all right.
this is what they want me to do.
morton: My instructions are to arrive at the bank at my normal time.
at 9: 10, an individual will arrive in the bank wearing a light-colored jacket and carrying a briefcase.
he'll introduce himself as the computer technician I supposedly called in.
I'm to escort him through security and into the main computer room.
MEGAN: On-site hacking means they need access to an encryption they can't break.
which must mean access to the ATMs.
it's not the money in the accounts they're after, either.
last year, in the Bay area, the Russian mob was able to steal 200, 000 credit card and bank card I. D.'s in one day.
pacific Mutual's linked to at least 50, 000 ATMs around the country.
all right, so they just need ten people a day to use those machines, they got half a million accounts.
Yeah. They take a thousand from each account, that's a half billion dollars, which they then route to untraceable overseas accounts.
and then they kill the hostages and Morton.
morton: If anybody but me comes into the room, it's over.
but they won't, because I control who has access to the computer room.
it's like Yuri said...
anything happens to me,
I don't make the right call at the right time, your employees will be killed.
I understand. Good.
then I'll get to work.
morton: At 5: 00 exactly, if everything has gone okay, he calls to indicate the money is secure.
I hope Don's right about this.
Yeah, me too.
are you hungry?
no.
it's coming up on lunch,
I thought maybe I could get us some food.
now shut up.
we need that number.
Where's that number? Come on.
the guy's cell phone is right there.
just needed to stretch.
sit down and stay down.
I said get back.
no problem.
I really can't take you looking at your watch anymore.
sorry. Sorry.
wait, wait, it's here.
Morton's text message.
uh! Hacker's cell phone number, yes!
and now for Charlie, come on, kid.
Charlie: Hello.
Hello?
my name is Professor Charles Eppes.
do you know who I am?
how did you get this number?
how about you come ask me in person?
you seem to know a lot.
I'd like to talk to you about where you learned it.
morton: What is it, what's wrong?
it's early, what's up?
Hacker: I just got a call from the mathematician.
you screwed up somewhere.
gave him what he needed to hack your phone.
no, no, I don't see how...
listen to me.
the FBI has no idea where you are or what you're doing, or they would have never have let him call you.
the situation is still in control.
Yuri: Keep working, get it done.
STENDHAUSER: We got it!
he made the call.
and we have a GPS track working.
I'll call you in a minute.
almost... done.
must have been quite an operation.
took you all day.
Yeah, well... I had a lot to do.
we got five minutes.
Walker says LAPD is handling containment.
all right, well, tell them to stay clear, all right?
I mean, I don't want anyone spotting us. Yeah.
they won't move until they get an official notice from us.
this guy's some psychopath, huh?
Yeah.
he probably thinks he's invincible by now.
I'm guessing he doesn't feel the need to put too much distance between him and the FBI.
MEGAN: Okay.
I got it, it's downtown.
don: All right, let's do it.
unit One to Unit Two, you're a go, you're a go.
COLBY: Copy that, Don. On the move.
I wouldn't if I were you.
well? Is it done?
COLBY: It's all done for you, my friend.
who...
Gary, go! MEGAN: I'm getting the hostages!
Lamont?! Are you okay? Colleen?
big breaths, Colleen, big breaths.
FBI! Get out of the way!
get out of the way!
Aah!
nice to finally meet you in person, Yuri.
nice shot.
and I called your family, too.
they're going to be at...
thank you.
thank you.
don: Hello?
Hey, Don.
hey... David.
our team found the guy who was watching the house.
I heard all about it. Good job; thanks.
look, man, you don't have to hang out here, you can take off. That's okay. I think your dad wanted me to hang around. Hey, what do you think? What do you think, huh?
Oh, I see why you're hanging around.
Alan: There you go,
agent Sinclair.
and there's a lot more where that came from. All right.
Thanks, Mr. Eppes. He gets the treatment, huh?
Yeah, and there's more coming right up.
Alan: Dig in, dig in.
Oh, man.
I got to tell you, that was a crazy couple days.
I mean... it's good we all came out of it all right, but...
it would appear to be so.
in a million years, I never would've imagined that, you?
I think Charlie would say it was a statistically possible but unlikely event.
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Charlie should just work at Cal Sci, Dad.
you're going to fire him?
I'm the first to admit he's done an amazing job for us.
right? I mean, but...
wouldn't it put your mind at ease?
Donny, what would put my mind at ease would be to see you two boys working together. Besides, you don't seriously think you're going to get him to stop.
Nah, I guess not.
Hey, Chuck, you need some help back there?
come on, Suzy Homemaker, we're ready to eat.
come on, come on. Go on, go on, eat, eat.
I have to say, Mr. Eppes...
I've never seen two brothers so completely different...
and so much alike.
if you call me "Chuck" one more time... Yeah, well, all right, how about "Chucky"? Tell me about it.
Chucky?" How about I call you "Donald"? How about I call you "nerd"?
how about I call you...
you complaining?
no, it's just that big storm last night.
I think I read somewhere the runoff is toxic.
that's fascinating.
are you always such a chick in the morning?
come on.
Hey.
look.
my God.
all right, so you're good?
all right, good. Bye.
so, Dad's all right.
he's going to take the shuttle back from the airport.
he appreciates that we at least tried to pick him up.
all right, well, I'm sorry I had to drag you out here.
Oh, believe me, I don't mind. Hmm.
Charlie, don't forget this is a crime scene.
right. All right, don't go touching anything.
Hey, guys.
we got four bodies that washed up on the beach early this morning.
all Asian, all female, no IDs.
don: Any idea where they're from?
it can't be too far away, otherwise the bodies probably would've drifted further apart.
coast Guard called us in.
they're calling this a crime on the high seas.
over there with Megan is a marine science officer.
he's supposed to know something about the local currents out here.
all right.
what's Charlie doing?
no idea.
science OFFICER: Big storm, but we've had very few distress calls in the past 24 hours. Yeah.
Hey, this is Special Agent Eppes. Hey, how're you doing?
MEGAN: And why is that you think?
a storm that big keeps all the small craft in port.
and we had nothing up near Palos Verdes that explains this.
wait. Why there?
the prevailing current in this area moves down from north.
they were in the water less than 24 hours.
they had to go in off Palos Verdes to end up here.
uh... What?
Yeah, but a flow from the north wouldn't be sustaining rip currents in this bay.
well, that's true, but, uh...
I'm sorry, who are you?
he's all right, he's with us.
you see those surfers there?
they're struggling against a significant riptide.
so I would say that the coastal flow is moving counter to the prevailing currents from the south.
we do get rips when the southwest swell starts to push against the... What is that in the water?
Hey, I got a heartbeat here.
man: Paramedic!
come on.
we all use math every day,
any theories on how these girls ended up on the beach?
I don't think they were out for a swim.
Yeah, it's tough to swim with your shoes on.
don: All right, so nothing from the Coast Guard.
no witnesses, no distress calls.
and what about the girl you pulled from the ocean?
still unconscious.
actually, someone should check her status and someone should talk to the coroner and see if we can get those autopsies fast-tracked, you know?
you want to draw straws?
Nah, I'll take the morgue.
you can owe me one.
Thanks.
COLBY: Hey, Don.
charter company called for you.
they said your boat's ready? All right.
your boat?
Yeah.
Charlie: So we need to keep dropping these buoys at one minute intervals.
right, and I am recording the ID numbers.
then what?
well, then we use the drift routes to identify what I hope will be an atypical shift in the local currents.
Chare, do you really think we're going to see any of these buoys again?
it's a very big ocean
Yeah, but for our objective, we really only need to be looking for them in one place.
right. The beach where the girls washed up.
you got it.
is this practical exercise really necessary?
we could have produced a highly functional theoretical result and never left dry land.
Larry, without your kinematic flow mapping, we wouldn't know where to drop these buoys.
I know, I know.
I know.
all right, I'm going below decks in a desperate search for more Dramamine.
AMITA: So last night ended up being pretty fun, huh?
Yeah, that was fun for a lecture on theories of axiomatic.
Yeah, not exactly the obvious outcome.
: no.
you know Claude Forbert is giving a lecture next week on Point-Set Topology.
want to go together?
sure, why not?
it'd be like, um...
like a "math date"?
I like that.
maybe there's hope for us.
so you were at the hospital?
she's in ICU.
Yeah, and?
there's complications from the hypothermia.
what, like, as in not gonna make it?
that's what the doctor says. It doesn't look good.
all right.
how you been?
I didn't expect to see you so soon.
look, you have any idea who's handling the four girls from the beach?
Yeah. Me.
catching a lot of homicide cases, okay?
you have a cause of death?
Mmm, they drowned.
well, not that surprising, but...
all four showed signs of acute dehydration.
that's crazy. You're surrounded by water, but still you're dehydrated?
the sea water actually accelerates dehydration.
it's the salt.
but I'd say tissue retraction started before they went in the water.
Meaning?
meaning you can rule out a luxury cruise.
you have any idea where they might be from?
in terms of dental analysis,
I'd say these three are from mainland China.
but this one over here...
she's had extensive orthodontic work.
I'd say she's American.
or at least grew up here.
she's also older than the other girls.
25 or six.
the rest are still in their teens.
COLBY: How'd she end up in the water with three teenage girls from China?
if you can figure out where she got that tattoo, might help you answer that.
this was done recently.
COLBY: The bottom of her foot.
how recent?
the skin's fully healed, but from the keloid scarring, I'd say a couple months.
maybe three.
I'm sorry I can't be more specific.
Nah, you're doing great.
it's so quiet.
it's so early.
it's damn early.
thanks for coming out here with me again.
glad to help.
it's actually nice to be away from school.
what would you think of doing something else outside of school, like seeing a movie?
are you asking me out on a "non-math date"?
Yeah, is that weird?
no.
I would like that.
but, um...
but what? Don't say "but."
come on, I know we've had our problems this year, but...
no, Charlie, it's not that.
Susan Berry was not a big thing.
she was here briefly and she couldn't wait to get back to the UK.
Charlie, I've been offered a-a job.
it's an...assistant professorship in the Math Department.
it's, um, at Harvard.
Harvard?
it's a three year appointment.
it's Massachusetts Harvard.
that's the one.
that's...
I mean that's...
really amazing.
three years is a long time.
isn't that a third buoy?
what? Where? There.
well, that's enough data to sustain your theory.
currents have shifted.
which means the Coast Guard was looking for witnesses and survivors in the wrong place.
david: Colby get any hits on the tattoo?
nothing.
it seems that the trail's hit a wall.
maybe Charlie's high seas adventure will give us something, you think?
Yeah, we could use a break.
even if it does require a math lesson.
MEGAN: Can we help you?
this is Claudia Gomez from the coroner's office.
Oh, from the "you'll take the morgue and I'll owe you one"?
excuse me?
Ah, it's nothing.
I brought over the pathology reports.
I didn't think it should wait.
what happened?
one of the girls from the beach,
I found the H5N1 strain in her system.
it's Bird Flu.
?From the Centers for Disease Control?
so far we've been lucky
the last pandemic flu killed almost 50 million people.
right. And I didn't think the bird flu w contagious for people.
okay.
h5n1 mostly effects avian populations, but it spreads very quickly, and it will infect people if they come in contact with the birds.
so it can adapt.
and rapidly.
now, the current strains of the virus settle deep in the lus, too deep for a cough to get it airborne.
but if it mutates...
it could spread rapidly through a human population.
that's our fear.
and most of us think that it's only a matter of time.
well, we think these girls are Chinese. Wait a minute,
I was told we were talking about a single case.
MEGAN: We're investigating several deaths, one case of the flu so far.
don: So what about linking the girl to an outbreakn China?
yeah... well, Chinese government hasn't exactly been open about their health issues.
and what about quarantine?
agent Eppes, we haven't had a case of Avian Flu in North America yet, and what you're telling me doesn't change that.
so you're just going to quash this?
our containment protocols are useless if we don't know where the girl contracted the flu.
all right, well what do you suggest we do, cover it up?
I'm not saying this isn't serious.
it is deadly serious.
but I don't think it's worth causing a widespread panic unless we have more information on the girl.
Charlie: So here's my tory.
the storm caused a sandcastle form at the north end of the bay.
right. The shift in the bottom features disrupted the tidal flow.
all right, so it's like a car race.
the flow around the track is even and thus predictable.
but let's say there's a crash-- the flow is disrupted, cars have to steer around the wreckage.
now if they don't clear that raceway,the flow is permanently changed.
the parallel isn't exact, but you get the idea:
all right,the currents shifted.
so where'd the girls come from?
well, they were dumped in the inbound shipping lanes, and these are the approximate coordinates.
alright, well, I mean, the Coast Guard's going to have to do another search.
Hey, look, if the girl with the flu on a boat, then there's a high probability she came into close quarters with other people.
right. If that virus was able to mutate...
I know, it might be spreading big time.
Hey, guys.
AMITA: Hey.
if you're looking for Charlie,
I think he's at the FBI.
Ah, shoot, yeah, I was.
don wanted me to drop off these search grids from the Coast Guard.
well, I can take them and give them to him.
can you? Yeah.
Thanks. Sure.
Oops. Hold on, let me get those.
boy, that's a strange tattoo.
hmm. Thanks.
Hey, wait a second.
these characters, are these from the I Ching?
you know, we don't know what those are, actually.
what's the I Ching?
Oh, it's an ancient book of Chinese divination.
it's still pretty influential.
I think these are from there.
is this related to the drowning?
Yeah, it's a tattoo we found on the bottom of one of the dead girls' feet.
that's a strange place for a tattoo.
Yeah, that's what I thought, too
it's like a toe tag.
but it got me thinking.
I remembered there were these guys in Special Forces that used to have their dog tags tattooed on their bodies in case their heads were... You know?
you know, in case...
and you think this young woman might have similar inclinations toward post mortem identification?
maybe.
do you have any idea what those characters might mean?
no. But...
well, I'm afraid my own expertise is not that specific.
but you may be correct in thinking that it does mean something.
how's that?
if I could just get you to hold that. Mm-hmm.
see, each of these characters, that has its own unique correspondence to its own unique number.
for instance, if you're looking at 31.
wait a minute, if these are all numbers, do you think it's possible this is some kind of code?
well, if it is, Charlie's a code-breaking machine, and he should be back really soon.
Yeah, that'd be great, we could use his help.
you know, it's perfectly understandable
a soldier's reasons for tattooing himself
he's walking into war.
but this girl, now her tattoo begs the question:
what was she walking into?
been going through the ship information from the Port Authority.
there were more than 30 ships in the area Charlie gave us.
all right, well, the coroner said they were Chinese.
why don't you try anything from Asia.
all right.
Yeah, that cuts it down a bit, but we've still got... four or five cargo ships. Right, well, it wouldn't be the first time they dumped bodies from those things, right?
Yeah.
Oh, Don, take a look at this.
one of these ships can carry 3, 000, maybe 4, 000 containers each.
you realize we could be talking about 2000 containers.
no, David, we're talking about one container.
we've tried every permutation possible for a Caesar shift.
reading from left to right, from right to left...
larry: You know, the I Ching is Chinese, maybe we need to consider phonetic chacters.
I already did. And?
there's only 37 symbols.
Yeah, yeah, which doesn't get us to 55 or 61.
okay, I know.
I do get it. We've been at this for six hours.
Nope, six and a half.
Ooh. Uh-oh, this doesn't look good.
no. Our breakthrough eludes us.
what, are you guys still thinking this is some kind of encrypted message?
it's too short to run a CRT analysis.
if it were longer, I could run a Kasiski exam, or try an index-of-coincidence assessment.
all we have is a mere ten digits.
it's just not enough for a frequency analysis.
well, maybe the problem is the underlying assumption.
I don't know, maybe she's right, maybe we're looking for complexity here when all there really is simplicity.
well, wait, what you mean?
maybe it's not a code.
it's a phone number.
it's ringing.
it's going to voicemail.
woman: This is Susan Lim.
if you've reached this number, then... I guess I'm dead.
please call Jeremy Wang, he's a reporter at the Tribune.
tell him what happened.
that's a message from a dead woman.
she's one of five women that washed up on a beach yesterday.
we don't know who they are or where they came from.
her name's Susan Lim.
we worked together.
I'm sorry.
um, do you have any idea how this might have happened?
she called me maybe three weeks ago.
she'd gotten as far as Shanghai, and her cousin helped her find a snakehead.
um, a "snakehead"?
Yeah, someone who arranged for her to get on a cargo ship.
she said there was 20 women on an 8'x40' container.
20 women. Yeah.
did she say the name of the ship?
I don't think she knew.
she was working on a story?
a book.
last year, we did a series of articles on the underground sex trade.
we heard how they were bringing the girls in.
she convinced the publisher to back an expose.
and just like that she could pull off going undercover in China?
Susan's first-generation Chinese-American, she grew up speaking Mandarin, and her mother's family's still in Zhejiang Province, in the countryside
they helped her.
last thing she told me...
if she pulls this off, she's a lock for a Pulitzer.
well, I'd really like to look at her notes.
so who is she?
who's who?
Charlie, whenever you look like this, it's always a problem with a girl.
look like what?
Michelle Robinson, remember her?
seventh grade? -Yeah.
when she wouldn't go with you to the dance at school...
you looked just like this for a week.
Amita got offered a job.
a great job.
but it's back east.
Amita, huh?
I thought you two weren't, um...
we weren't.
but lately- Oh, I see.
so you decided not to try so hard, huh?
I guess that's part of it.
I... I just felt like things were finally starting to happen.
so, uh, she might get a job back East, huh?
well, she hasn't decided, but it's Harvard.
how can she pass that up?
Mm.
well, you know, "starting to happen" is, um...
that's not really worth fighting for.
I think when you focus on your feelings about her
your real ones
that, uh, you'll... you'll know what to do.
can you pass the milk?
david: Eight million containers pass through this port every year, man.
Phew! Wow.
how we supposed to find just one?
I don't know.
given what might be in it, we better figure that out.
david: We think the ship might have sailed from Shanghai.
shanghai. Well, that narrows it down to two.
the Li-Po, still here, but unloaded.
the other ship, the Nanking, 75% clear.
all right. Well, we're going to need you to search all the cargo still on that ship.
now, you're talking about more than a thousand containers.
I'd have to pull every able-bodied man I have for something like that.
so pull them.
what exactly are you guys looking for?
about 15 Chinese girls locked up in a container.
that's not going to be enough.
excuse me?
look, I hate to say it, but a few undocumented workers it's not a priority for us.
we're more worried about a bomb.
now, look, this may qualify.
I don't follow.
we already found one of the girls from the container.
she had the Bird Flu.
you got to be kidding me.
no, I wish we were.
okay. We'll impound every container left on the Nanking.
maybe we get lucky, your girls are still on board.
and if they're not， Who unloaded the ship?
uh, longshoremen from 151 worked both ships.
Ja·Morrison is in charge, but I wouldn't count on much help.
why is that?
guys who work the docks-- not exactly Boy Scouts.
MEGAN: I got a message you're not releasing
Susan Lim's notes.
after you left, I started thinking.
why is the FBI so interested in these girls?
because a reporter, your partner, was probably murdered.
I get that, but you were already on the case when this was just a Chinese girl being brought in for the sex trade.
I don't see how that matters.
when we were doing our story, we saw 12-year-old girls being sold by their families.
prostitutes beaten by their pimps, left on the sidewalk to die.
we knew who was behind it.
but they were hidden behind dummy import companies, and we couldn't get to them.
I don't see where this is going.
we called the FBI.
they said if it wasn't terrorism, it wasn't a priority.
but here you are now, the same FBI, wanting her notes.
it's just a homicide investigation.
agent Reeves, if what you're looking for is related to Susan's death, these boxes are important.
I can subpoena these boxes, and her notes, and all of your notes, all of it.
you know my paper won't give them up without a fight.
the courts could take weeks, months even, to sort it out.
I just want to know what happened to her.
I'll give you the rest of the story, but you can't run with it until after I close the case.
nail whoever did this.
the FBI the reason my guys on the Nanking are sitting on their butts?
that ship should have been unloaded by now.
we wouldn't be hold you up if it weren't important.
important, huh?
poll numbers slipping in Washington?
we need your help finding a container.
it came off either the Li-Po or the Nanking.
we just take them off the ship.
we don't look inside.
you run the dockworkers' union, and you've never heard anything about contraband coming off these ships, huh?
that's right.
so we look into your finances, we won't find anything but union dues?
we are looking for a container that just came in.
it's full of Chinese girls.
I don't know about anything like that.
I'll have a warrant for your books in less than an hour.
okay, okay.
I'll talk to the guys who worked the ships.
see what I can find out.
if something got through the port that shouldn't have, you ought to be talking to Customs.
they have a new security system.
uses some kind of algorithm to figure out what boxes to search.
I'm sorry.
did you just say algorithm?
dad just told me.
Yeah. It stinks. Oh!
well, not for Amita, but...
it's a great opportunity for her.
I just...
well, look, I mean, maybe you should just go.
what?
well, you know, you get all those, uh, visiting professor offers, right? So go visit.
man, we haven't even gone on a halfway decent date.
I can hardly go chasing her across the country.
what's up? What do you need?
that container-- it's gone.
it's already been unloaded.
but the port says they use some kind of a security algorithm.
Yeah. Yeah, it analyzes a probability matrix for high-risk or dangerousargo.
ranks containers according to threat potential.
all right, good, you know about it.
I was on the team that designed it.
no way? Oh.
you want to know if you can use the algorithm, work backwards, to find this container?
Yeah. I mean, we have 15 girls-- they're going out into the workforce, and-and...
I mean, they might have this deadly virus, so I don't know what else to do.
you realize the initial rate of transmission for a disease like influenza amongst prostitutes. Even I can do that math.
so, let me know what you get, all right?
and don't worry, you're gonna be all right. It'll be fine.
think this tip's gonna pan out?
it will if Morrison believes your threat about getting a warrant for his finances.
that was no threat.
Hey, guys, I'll be right with you.
Jack Morrison sent us over.
that's your guy right over there.
wait a minute. You're serving drinks to that kid?
he said he was 21.
what else did he say?
well, last couple nights, uh, he comes in at this same time.
um, gets drunk as fast as he can.
then he starts crying about, uh, throwing girls off a ship.
did you call the police?
I didn't think he was serious.
not until, uh, Morrison came by, asked about Chinese girls.
Hey, wait a minute!
FBI!
FBI, Raymond!
hands behind your back.
why do they always run?
cause we wear suits, man.
guys figure you can outrun a guy in a suit.
stand up. Let's go.
in the kusina. Since I leave Manila.
well, I just spoke to the hospital, and that last girl didn't make it.
so I'm looking at you for five murders.
I don't understand what you're talking about...
I-I didn't hurt them. It doesn't matter.
you were there. You want to tell me what happened.
maybe I can help you.
one girl, she was sick.
the captain call the people who pay him to bring the girls.
they say kill the sick one.
who did he call?
you know who he called?
the other girls that went overboard-- they were sick, too?
five of them come on the ship together.
I don't know what that means.
farm... farm girls?
farm girls? Right.
they... We throw those away, then wait, see if any else get sick.
you'd throw them away?
the captain says he lose too much money if he kill them all.
where are they now?
another box.
in-in a box.
the container?
Yeah.
and where is that?
it's gone.
okay.
cobbled together some code.
it will parse the cargo data.
I appreciate the help.
is that the stuff from the reporter?
Yeah.
Megan brought it over.
it's the reporter's notes on the illegal sex trade in Los Angeles.
it's fairly disturbing.
you're going to use that to reconsider the risk variables for the port security algorithm?
Yeah.
is that going to be enough data?
no, but that will be.
Yeah. It's more of the same from the FBI.
Hey, uh, you know what?
I know it's late, but can you do one last thing for me?
what do you need?
this is a list of the companies that were used to launder money.
no. There's already a table for that in the database.
you already put it in?
Yeah. I mean, I figured that you're trying to find the owner of this missing container, and you needed a way to connect the import-export business with the sex trade.
all right.
we work pretty well together, don't we?
actually, you're a little bossy.
I'm being serious.
serious about what?
Greg Michaels is taking a three-year sabbatical.
Yeah, I heard.
and to cover his course load, they're creating an assistant professorship.
you'd be a perfect candidate...
for... that...
job.
Oh.
what? Did I say something I shouldn't have?
I don't know, Charlie.
it's just that my job is starting to feel like it's all about your job.
david: Coast Guard just called.
pulled another body out of the water this morning.
another girl?
no. Captain of the Li-Po.
Really? -Yeah.
you think somebody noticed the kitchen boy went missing from the ship, and decided to start cleaning up some loose ends?
Yeah, seems that way.
whoever's doing the cleanup's got to know that Nipay's talking to us.
Yeah. What do you think about that union guy?
Morrison? -Yeah.
I don't know.
why give us Nipay in the first place?
wait a minute.
even a cabin boy gets a phone call, right?
Yeah. Let's find out who Nipay called.
Charlie: So, the port security algorithm analyzes potential terrorist threats.
however, it misses things like drugs, contraband, even human cargo.
so, we could potentially stop a dirty bomb, but a pandemic flu is in like Flynn?
not anymore. Not anymore if this works.
I love this part.
so, the security algorithm uses inputs like point of origin, the company shipping the goods, the volume and type of cargo.
it focus on trouble areas.
think of a... a dandelion?
the ones you used to blow into the wind when you're a kid.
the algorithm evaluates the threat potential of each seed.
harmless seeds are released.
bad seeds are identified and contained.
so if we change the inputs, we can track different seeds.
exactly, and I used Susan Lim's research to create a whole new set of input variables.
so, you found the container?
containers. Plural.
there's more than one?
no, but there are limits to how precise the algorithm can be.
I ran it against the cargo manifest of the Li-Po, and I narrowed it down to four possibilities.
one of the import companies on this list has your container.
Oh.
david: Raymond Nipay-- he made a call to a private club in Little Taipei.
COLBY: It took some doing, but we were able to sort through the IRS database.
we were able to run down owner
steven Jintao.
this guy not only owns the private club but he also owns three massage parlors in the area.
we can definitely connect him to the container?
Yeah, using the reporter's notes.
Yeah, Jintao built this little empire smuggling in Chinese girls.
got their families to pay for the freight.
most of the time, they had no idea what was happening to them on the other end.
guy saw an opportunity to exploit the girls on both sides of the smuggling.
he brings them over, and then he puts them to work in the massage parlors and the clubs.
right. They promise them the moon, they pimp them out.
pretty twisted version of the American dream.
and where is he? DAVID: LAPD says he has an office at his club.
go get him. Let's go.
we're the only white people in here.
Yes, we are.
probably already made us.
we don't exactly blend in.
are you looking for a girlfriend?
actually, we're looking for this guy right here.
woman: I've never seen him.
there's another one running.
he's moving out the back.
Yeah, yeah.
get down on the car.
we're looking for the girls from the Li-Po.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Really? 'Cause I think you do.
: that hurts.
I'll start the search.
you guys with me.
Where's the container?
I want my lawyer.
that wasn't the question.
we lost his paperwork last night, but we're gonna have to let him talk to his lawyer.
fine, let the lawyer file a writ.
MEGAN: We're not giving them a technicality they can use in court.
Megan, we're talking about a pandemic flu here.
I don't really care about a technicality.
don, we have enough information to put this slime-bag down a very deep hole.
it's not deep enough, not yet.
okay, Granger, explain to me why it is we only care about these girls when there's a risk that their customers might get sick.
don: Captain called you.
and you told him to throw that girl and everyone with her in the water.
you know how I know that?
one of those girls was a reporter working a story.
you're lying.
one more of those girls gets sick- I'd like to go back to my cell.
you're not going anywhere, you understand me? You slime!
you're gonna sit down and tell me exactly what I want to know!
take a break, ok?
let him call his lawyer, and then throw him in that hole.
stop it.
what?
okay, maybe we should just take a break, huh?
I'm all right, I'm just a little distracted at the moment.
yeah? What, Amita?
how'd you know?
the look-- I know all your looks.
have you been conferred with my father?
no.
Hey, Charlie.
look, we're in trouble here.
I mean, I can't get anything out of this guy Jintao.
those girls are still out there, not to mention the threat of pandemic flu.
we've been working on a destination probability matrix using Susan Lim's notes, your list of Jintao's businesses...
that's why I'm here. What do you got?
something's not right in the data or there's a bug somewhere in this matrix.
because my equation keeps returning an empty set.
larry: Wait a second.
hold on here.
what if, Charles, what if the matrix equation is working?
what if? Then we'd have an answer.
Yeah, but what if the empty set is the answer.
they never left the port.
the algorithm wasn't pointing to a destination, because the girls never left their starting point.
green Jade Corp?
no.
what's that, like, strike number 12?
we just need one warehouse to match one of Jintao's businesses.
how about this.
let's sort tm according to when they took the space.
maybe Jintao had to rent something new to store the container.
Wai Gong Imports.
company signed a lease the day before we found the girls on the beach.
you said Wai Gong?
Yeah.
we got him.
Yeah. Nice.
this is the building Wai Gong Imports subleased.
I have movement inside.
you guys, cover the warehouse!
we got to get them out of there.
we can't, not yet.
we need to get a medic and a translator in here now!
ladies, just give us a minute, okay?
so your guy Jintao used this warehouse for quarantine?
till he decides to cut his losses, yeah.
he just left these ladies here to die.
so none of the girls turned up with the flu?
well, they're still under quarantine.
but so far looks like we got lucky, this time.
San's publisher offered me a book deal.
they want me to write about what happened to her, the girls, all of it.
well, it's a heck of a story.
maybe you'll be the one who ends up with a Pulitzer.
it'd be nice to say that Susan's up there somewhere, looking down, happy about this.
but...
she was so damn competitive.
I'm sure she's furious that I landed an exclusive.
well, we did bring down Steven Jintao, and we rescued the girls from the container.
we couldn't have done any of that without Susan's notes.
that is something she can be happy about.
Oh, yeah.
may I come in?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
sure.
I wanted to say that I'm sorry about yesterday.
you were just trying to help, and I was out of line.
actually... I think you were right.
not too long ago, you made the point that my work and my work for the FBI got in the way of personal relationships.
Yeah, I remember.
just... let me finish.
you said a relationship could work, but only if I was willing.
I was talking about Don.
I was talking about your brother.
were you?
it's not... Charlie...
fair of me to ask you to sacrifice your career if I'm not willing to sacrifice mine.
thank you for that.
this year turned out a whole lot differently than I'd expected.
Yeah, for me, too.
so what are we going to do?
well, Harvard called.
and they need an answer by next week.
so what are you going to do?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
Oh, that's it, that's gin, kid.
again?! -Yep.
how do you get so lucky?
so you owe me 120 bucks.
what?- Unless of course you want to go again.
I'm taking you down.
Yeah?- Yeah.
all right. -And I'm dealing.
no, it's my deal. No, I'm dealing.
it's my deal. -No, you cheat.
I cheat? Listen to this guy.
Alan: Hey, Charlie, would you figure the odds on your brother winning 11 games of gin in a row if he's not cheating?
don: He's the one who taught me how to count cards.
was that Amita?
Yeah.
she just left.
yeah? So you moving backast?
no. No, I'm not moving to Massachusetts.
Ah, come on, Bruins games, pal.
season tickets.
what about Amita?
I'm not sure.
you all right?
I'm not sure about that either.
he gonna love Beantown.
especially in the winter.
Oh, yeah.
can't go to Red Sox games, though, that's the thing, right?
no Red Sox games.
no cheating.
hey Jimmy, check gallery one, will ya?
Hey,Jimmy?
you there?
no sign of an outside try. Guy must of come in dung business and laid in wait.
he had key-card access to the entire building, could of hid out anywhere.
any witnesses?
no, he w wearing a mask, guards didn't get a look.
we, this thing looks pretty high tech to me.
What'd they get? - Pissarro painting.
estimated wort- 22 million. - Yeah?
what is it? - Paris au printemps, apres-mi.
you speak french? - There was a girl, once upon a time.
who's that?
museum curator, arthur Ruiz. He was in bed, when he got the call.
excuse me, guys, I got it, thanks.
how are you doing? Don eppes, fbi. - Hello.
so, uh, what can you tell me about the security here?
well, we're a small museum, but the system's state of the art.
any changes in routine, security guard roster changes?
you're thinking one of my people had something to do with this?
well, we' gonna need to see a list. - Any security footage you might have.
of course, of course, that, uh, that pissarro was thmost valuable piece we had.
that pissarro was thmost valuable piece we had.
and frankly, the timing couldn't be worse.
Why's that?
the painting was scheduled to begin a major tour next month.
well, you got insurance, right?
actually, the pissarro was on loan from a private owner in glendale.
he's out of town on vacation.
he must be a generous guy, loan you something so valuable.
actually, one of the advantages of loaning a painting to a museum is the savings on an insurance policy.
assumption being a secure museum is as safe as a bank vault.
I'll get you that personnel list.
so much for safe assumptions.
so much.
you're not leaving that?
so, so I'll-I'll clean it up when I get back.
this isn't animalhouse, charlie.
right, this is my house. - Ye, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.
it's not for sale. - I'm not interested in buying the house back.
just like to see you put more into maintaining it.
it's a cup of coffee, it's a bowl of cereal. - Oh, yeah.
what about the lk in the attic, huh?
the garage door needs fixing, cable is out.
cable's out? - Yeah.
since when is the cable out?
since our resident math genius forgot to pathe bill.
look, I don't want to be a , I just want you to live up to your responsibilities.
all right, all right, I'll tell you what. Make a list for me.
okay.
I already did.
running down the museum employees, but no one's popped. And we have eyes on the video.
so this guy beat a card-entry system, lasers and motion sensors.
he's a pro. - Hey, guys.
which is why we have to move fast if we have any hope of catching him or finding this painting.
Jack tollner, from new york, theft unit out of D. C.
david sinclair, megan reeves. - Morning.
you got here pretty quick. - Yeah, well, 22 million buys you a red eye.
- Art theft unit, huh?
I alwa pictured you guys for horn rims and bow ties.
well, lasik surgery took care of the horn rims, and I've never been partial to bow ties, but if you like them, I'll go out and get myself one.
Oh, what are we looking at here?
well, based on the paperwork the museum sent over, I'm guessing a piece like this may be difficult to move.
I'm guessing a piece like this may be difficult to move - Because of its value? - Because of its provenance.
Provenance? - The paper trail of ownership, the documentation of a pie of art's origins-- and this pissarro has quite a tainted one.
what do you mean, byainted?
this isn't the first time this painting's been stolen.
first time was by the nazis.
Nazis stole the painting?
the provenance shows a pattern of nazi loot art that I've seen before.
loot how?
when the nazis came into power, they passed laws forcing jews to register property, it provided them virtual "shopping liS.
they looted homes by day, shped the families off to the camps the same night.
right and no witnesses.
except for the few who surved.
all right, well, what we do know is that whoever stole the pissarro had skills.
well, the bureau has a database of career art thieves, I'd start there.
all right, I'll get on it.
this is the perfect way to show that electric and magnetic forces are two sides of the same coin.
Hey, guys, what, uh, what are we doing here.
Oh, this screw is attached to this battery by a magt and the current running through the wire is causing that screw to spin.
and the current running through the wire is causing that screw to spin.
let me guess, show-and-tell day?
Yeah, charlie and I are preparing a joint lecture on circular motion.
Yeah, the movement is governed by fleming's left hand rule.
our lecture's also looking the coriolis force.
it's the same principle that causes hurricanes to spin counterclockwise in our hemisphere.
so, what's happened? What's up?
a pissarro was stolen last night, the father of impressionist painting.
pissarro, I'm sorry?
at, uh, the roland museum, they we in and out less than six minutes, so we got a database of art thieves, names, MO'S
I'm figuring you can get through it faster than us.
maybe we could u a quadratic discriminant analysis.
right, we can look for a combation of attributes in this existing set of data that match to a new set of data.
good, good. In this case, identifying variables of a particular theft.
type of art, museum, security, specifics of the crime.
because there has to be something to this museum
because there has to be something to this museum
right.
in a field of flows we know that only certain types of flowers attract certain types of insects.
an insect will alight on certain flowers.
just like a thief will only be attracted to certain targets, based on specific characteristics.
we know the characteristics of this most recent theft.
and we can compare that data to past thefts using a quadratic discriminant analysis,
I mean, we should be able to quickly and, you know, efficiently boil down your suspect pool.
all right, I came to the right place.
I might have a suspect here.
eight years ago, mrs. Erika hellman, was notified by the art loss register that the current owner of the pissarro was trying to sell it.
art loss register?
database of lost orooted artworks, I've often seen it come into play in holocaust claS.
owner's dealer checked the pissarro against registry, found mrs. Hellman's claim that it had been looted by the nazis.
she sued the owner, his name's peyton shoemaker, and she lost.
apparently, there was insufficient documentation.
not surprising. The nazis were very good at covering their tracks.
how old is this woman? - Um, according to the dmv, she's 78.
there are people she could have paid to do this.
did you know about the pissarro's provenance, Mr. Ruiz?
well, of course. As the museum's curator, i have to know.
doesn't sound like you were too troubled by the indications that it was once looted by the nazis.
no, it was a concern.
but we did our due diligence. The owner's paperwork was in order.
we were satisfied with the assurances he provided us.
specially with the importance of an acquisition like this one.
there are many paintings with problematic provences, agent reeves.
that doesn't mean they're all nazi lted art.
Yes, but none of those other paintings would have increased your admission revenue by 50 percent.
look, I don't deny the pissarro's been a boon to a small museum like ours.
perhaps the guggenheim can afford to be more selective, but we can'T.
so, one family's misfortune will be another man's treasure.
the painting hung in our home in berlin.
when I was little, my father used to pretend we were the people in the painting.
he always promised that when I got old enough he would take us all there to paris.
obviously, did not happen.
I'm sorry for your loss, and I hope you understand why i would have to ask you about it.
well, I hate to disappoint you, but you, you have the wrong man.
naturally, I would love to have it back again.
you see, the nazis, they took everything.
not just the painting.
I dot have one photograph of my family.
but wh I look at the pissarro...
I-I feel as if I was seeing them all again.
you have any idea who might have taken it?
no, but we know who stole it 70 years ago.
sorry, nana, traffic on the freeway. I got here as soon as I could.
Yeah. - Hi.
this is my grandson, joel. This is agent...
Eppes, Don Eppes. - FBI.
from what I understand, a federal court denied your grandmother's claim?
they used the law against her, same way they used it against my great-grandfather in 1938.
we just didn't have the money to continue the fight.
what my grandson is saying is that we did not lose the painting on the merits of the case.
we lost it because my memory is failing.
my grandmother is the only living witness who ever saw the pissarro hanging in her father's home.
the rest of the family were murdered by the nazis.
the court would not accept the failing memory of an old woman.
I had seven sisters and brothers.
you have family? - Yeah, I have a father and a brother.
my mother passed away a few years ago.
you know what loss is then.
well, I-I, u.
look, I'm going to need to take a look at your phone and your bank records.
now, of course, this would be with your consent.
maybe you'd like to take a painting.
Joel, please.
I did not steal the pissarro.
though I admit, it has run through my mind many times.
surely you can understand this.
family is our anchor into this life.
we lose it, we're adrift.
you have no idea what it's like to be the only survivor of your family...
and to have no idea why.
I find this whole nazi association just so sadly ironic.
how do you mean? - Okay, just observe this perspective.
no most artists at the time, they painted street scenes from the street level.
Yeah, but is was painted from a rooftop.
Why? Artistic choice?
survival.
pissarro was jewish. He was living in paris athe time of the dreyfus affair.
anti-semitic mobs were roaming the streets.
he feared for his life.
how do you know so much about pissarro, larry?
Oh, my father was a painter.
Really? You never to us that.
it's not a memory that I gladly inhabit.
why, all this went under the heading of, what, parental disappointment?
he wanted you to be a painter?
he wanted me to see the world the way he saw it.
which is the folly of fatherhood.
tell me about it.
Why?
are you and your dad having problems?
you know, he's been getting on my case about how I maintain my house.
now you see why I sold my house, okay?
renounce all worldly cares fothe more sublime pursuits.
I think we got somethi from the fbi's art theft database.
three similar robberies.
analyzing past thefts for common variables with our current crime,
I've succeeded in identifying three suspects
michael Ness, Ben Larkin, and this is Ronald Wheeler
ness is in a prison in turkey.
now, there's a good time. - And I think larkin's dead.
Yeah, murdered three years ago in kiev.
all right, so we focus on wheeler. - Wheeler's canadian.
database has a current address for wheeler in toronto.
you know your art thieves, huh?
I'm impressed with how quickly you combed through our database.
Homend security has no record of wheeler entering the country.
all right. Well, no surprise there, right?
he'll be traveling on a false passport.
let's get his picture ou to everyone, right? The hotels, airports, train stations, you know?
and I'd start with the upscale ones. - And within the last week.
you got a $22 million painting, you're not goi to stay in some dump.
he said his name was gautier. - His real name is wheeler.
good morning, Mr. Gautier.
Mr. Gautier is not entertaining visitors.
we're going to need you to stay back.
rold wheeler, fbi. We want to talk with you.
clear.
you smell gunpowder?
we just went way past stealing high-end art.
somebody's willing to kill for this painting.
Mrs. Hellman's story's not that unusual.
similar thing happened to a woman who got several klimt paintings back from an austrian national museum.
they fought her for years.
I mean, she said it's the only thing that's left from her family.
I guess the federal court didn't see it that way, though. Not for the hellmans anyway.
or the owner, this Mr. Shoemaker, just has more bucks to throw at a high-priced legal team.
is he back from his vacation?
Why? Do you think he stole his own painting?
look, I mean, he tries to sell it and gets a lawsuit.
right. Maybe an insurance company won't ask the same questions?
when did you get home?
uh, about an hr ago. - Didn't you hear me working outside?
no, I didn't. - The re-circ pump on the koi pond's on the fritz.
yeah? Fish are okay?
Yeah, thanks to me playing bucket brigade.
don'you remember I told you that that pump needed servicing?
Yeah, well, I've been busy, too, charlie.
you know, at your age, I had a house, a wife, and two kids to take care of.
any murders to solve?
no, seriously. Any life-altering mathematical advances to conceive of?
Oh, I see-- the same old story, the me excuse for everything.
I don't need... you know what?
I don't need a lecture on how to run my o home, much less my life.
the pissarro was inherited.
my father's the one who made the original purchase.
any idea from who?
a reputable dealer in paris.
it was right after the war. My father was in the army on leave in paris.
he stopped by a shop, saw the painting, fell in love.
and did he question its origin?
after the war, it was difficult to know where anything came from.
so many had died or fled.
we, how hard did you think he, uh, actually tried?
my father bought the painting from a legitimate dealer.
I have the paperwork. He paid a fair price.
What,$12, 000?
$12, 000 was a great amount of money in those days.
well, still, it's nowhere near the 20 million you were trying to get eight years ago.
I'm just curious-- does it...
even bother you at all knowing where it came from?
well, the fact is, i don't know where it comes from. No one does.
but they have suspicions, don't they?
and I understand with the taint on the painting, it'll be almost impossible to get the price your asking.
I'm not sure I understand where this is going.
the pissarro is insured. - For $22 million.
if you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting...
yeah?
I feel bad for Mrs. Hellman, I really do, but the court heard all the evidence.
that woman did not stand a chance.
which is precisely why I offered her a settment.
30% of the proceeds of any sale I made if she agreed to drop her claim against the painting.
and she refused? - Her grandson.
he threw my attorney's offer in my face.
you know, I had my father's honor to consider.
I had to match it against the compromised memory of an elderly woman.
if it were your father, who would you believe?
Hey.
Oh, it looks pretty serious. Huh? - No. Oh, no. Come in.
yeah? - No, actually, no. I'm just, uh...
I'm balancing my checkbook. - The bank called.
I guess I overdrew paying some bills.
Oh, don't say it. What?
I'm a math genius, and I can't even balance my own checkbook.
right. I got an earful from dad. - I didn't say anything.
I should have known, you know, this arrangement of dad living with me would just end up driving us both completely insane.
I sort of get it now. I mean, why you bought the house.
it's, like, it gives you an anchor, you know? I mean, where you grew up, your family.
what's up?
why you think we were never religious?
mom wanted a christmas tree.
Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's funny, right?
this case got you thinking about at?
Yeah, a little bit.
actually, I need some help with this, charlie.
Oh, great, and dad wonders why I can't get any work done.
well, it's just I'm trying to figure out where, you know, whoever stole the pissarro would go next.
with wheeler dead...
I imagine the options are pretty limited. - Totally.
but I do suspect that there are only a places that this painting might end up, and that can be charted with a diffusion map usg a network diffusion proba...
just slow down.
it's like a vehicle traveling along a network of roads.
you know, cars can go anywhere, right?
but a commercial truck is limited to how many routes it can travel, and if that truck is carrying hazardous material, well , then, the network becomes even more restricted.
if it's carrying nuclear waste, the network becomes even more limited, and there are only a few destinations-- repositories-- where nuclear waste can go.
it's thsame with the pissarro. There are only a few places that it can travel.
Shoemakerr might be right on target with the grandson.
I have phone logs going back to the time that shoemaker made the settlement offer.
And?
Mrs. Hellman's grandson made several calls to a private investigator specializing in the recovery of stolen artwork, peter tucci.
why do I know that name? - He has, uh, pending charges in istanbul related to the crime that michael ness is doing time r in turkey.
ness is one of the art thieves that crlie pulled off the database.
Yeah, check this out. the museum records its, uh, security footage digitally.
I pulled an mpeg file from about three months ago.
nice.
Mrs. Hellman's grandson? Is he casing the place?
he contacted tucci three years ago.
about hiring ness to rip off the pissarro.
but when ness got caught, he couldn't do the job.
joel hellman really couldn't take no for an answer.
I don't know a guy named ronald wheeler or how he ended up dead.
have a seat.
I haven't done anything.
tell me about your relationship with peter tucci.
that was over three years ago.
right around the time the courts decided against you.
I lost my cool. It was a stupid thing to do.
look I understand how you feel. I mean with your grandmother and all - and then not being able to help her. - They embarrassed her.
they brought in doctors and tested her memory and made her live through things that...
that's a photo of you at the museum taken three months ago.
I go a lot.
I don't know, somehow it made me feel...
better to be close to it.
not as good as having it would make you feel thoughright?
no.
I told you, I haven't done anything.
so what do you think?
well, I think he thought about it, but I don't think he did it, he didn't make any real efforts to cover his tracks either.
well, now we're back to the owner, shoemaker, and the insurance scam.
it's a nice theory, but so far I can't find a paper trail between shoemaker and our thief, wheeler.
I mean, there's no payments to a middle man, there's nothing.
that painting's got toe somewhere.
Yeah, the numbers are staggering.
the nazis looted hundreds of thousands of artworks.
nearly a fifth of all european art at the time.
Yeah, there's still a lot out there, you know? Museums, dears, collectors...
Yeah, it's just appalling-- blood trade.
I am starting to see a pattern here.
you knowthe heaviest flow of art running along these networks.
china being a prime destination.
so we should start concentrating on networks supplying to china.
wouldn't be dad, would it? - It's a standoff 379 00: 23: 29, 010 -- > 00: 23: 32, 860 hey, here's another chestnut from my rather exhaustive study of the great artists.
do you know that monet's father wanted him to be a grocer?
Oh, yeah?
good thing is he didn't listen.
well, fathers imposing their wls on their sons...
I tell ya, that is the stuff of legend. - This is hardly so grand.
I mean, the last message he left me equated my refusal to take out the garbage with my supposed commitment-phobia and my failure to settle down.
there might be some truth in that.
there what?
uh, I'm just saying...
where were we? China?
Hey, that smells good.
Where's charlie?
I don't know, working late I guess.
or hiding from you.
he's been complaining? - You been giving him a hard time?
he owns the place, you know.
remember when I was looking for a place of my own?
and I thought that staying on here was gonna keep me from moving on.
what does th have to do with charlie? Well, he just comes anhe goes.
he has no idea how to maintain a home.
dad, the guy's got a lot on his plate. Hey look, I don't want to be a pest.
I just want to make sure that when the time comes, he knows how to take care of his own house
his own family if he ever s one.
well, talk to him. I mean, you can't just ride him like he's a little kid.
are you referring to my failures with you?
me? I'm a lost cause, pal.
what's up?
you had a tough day?
you know I had to interview that holocaust survivor yesterday, her grandson today.
Oh, about that painting, huh? - I felt weird 'cause nobody believes the woman;
it's like her life never existed because there's nobody left who remembers it.
Yeah.
you remember my mother's cousin, anna?
Yeah, I mean... - yeah, it was the same way with her.
she got out before the war, but she spent her whole life
the whole rest of her life - searching for her people.
can you imagine that? I mean, living that life going through all that?
like this woman finds a piece and it gets taken away again.
let me get you a plate.
Hey, did your mom's cousin ever find anyone?
no, not a single soul.
still taking your meals outside the home, I see.
still brown bagging it.
is this some of your work? - It's my submission for entry into art school.
one of the many life steps I never took. - You're pretty good.
don't mistake technical ability for originality.
almost every one of these is a copy of a masterwork.
my father insisted that before I attempt anything original, I had to understand those who came before me.
I had to understand those who came before me.
I mean, what is all this red marginalia here?
when network analysis came up empty I found these leads to china.
still no sign of the pissarro so I must've miscalculated.
well, current wisdom holds that the picture's nazi associations have compromised its potential for sale on the black market.
compromised yeah, but eliminated no.
yet you can find no market to which you can trace a sale.
cha seemed the best bet. Don came up empty.
perhaps this pissarro is not for sale anywhere because for some rson because for some reason it's simply not saleable.
even with the taint, it's still worth millions. Why wouldn't it be "saleable"?
no idea.
I'm leaving.
all right.
I think I've figured out why you haven't been able to find the pissarro.
using a computer program that analyzes fine art paintings from enhanced photographs.
now uses two criteria: Craquelure...
craquelure?
it's a fancy word for the crac that form on the surface of a painting.
and those cracks form patterns which will give us an idea of where and when a work was inted because the pattern depends on the artist's materials: T
the paint, the brush. even the canvas.
a painter in 15th century florence used different materials than a painter in 17th century london or a painter in 19th century paris
see, different materials and the vagaries of time create specific craquelure patterns which we can analyze using mathematical models.
you said there were two criteria. - Right, well...
the analysis also looks at visual style - the artist's actual brushstrokes.
like a fingerprint? - More like a signure.
see with currency, I used a wavelet analyS.
but with paintings, I can use a more sophisticated curvelet analysis, allong us to look at the art in three dimensions.
using curvelet analysis, we can measure the contours and depth of an artist's brushstrokes, giving us a mathematical expression of the artist's unique signature...
which we then use to evaluate other rks attributed to the artist to see if the same hand did, in fact, paint them all.
enhancing the museum catalogue photo of the pissarro,
I ran both analyses and compared it to other pissarros from museums around the world.
the results are undeniable.
this isn't a pissarro.
it's a fake.
the pissarro a forgery? It's not possible.
our math consultant did an extensive analysis, Mr. Ruiz.
from a photograph. - With a computer's enhancement.
I'm sorry, but whatever consultt you used is mistaken.
I'm afraid that's not really possible.
well, it has to be.
this painting underwent an extensive authentication process when it arrived here a year and a half ago.
then what about a switch? What if someone changed the painti since the authentication?
how?
when?
I don't work at a museum, but have you cleaned the painting in the past year and a half?
under the strict supervision of the museum conservator.
who also, by the way, performed the authentication.
and that would have been done on the premises, correct?
Yes.
in our restoration department.
the pissarro was taken down june 3rd for a cleaning.
who did the work? Me.
and you also performed the authencation on the pissarro when it first arrived here?
that's right.
and you're certain that the painting you cleaned on june 3rd is the same one you authenticated eighteen months ago.
Patrick has been with me 20 years. I trust his judgment completely.
so, there's no chance you missed something?
this painting was the most important piece we've ever displayed here.
Mr. Holden?
I'm certain that the painting was the same one that I examined a year and a half ago.
you have your answer.
is it you that also does the museum catalogues, Mr. Holden.
for every exhibition.
when was the photograph of the pissarro taken?
I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know?
this particular photograph was furnished by the owner.
Peyton shoemaker gave you the photograph?
once in a while an owner loaning a painting does accompany the piece with his own photographic documentation.
so shoemaker provided the photo when he first loaned the piece to the museum.
the same photograph your brother used to determine it was a forgery.
okay, so we're saying, what, the stolen one was a fake.
but did shoemaker know it? - He may even be the one who had it made.
forgery of his own painting?
owners often have forgeries made to protect their art against theft.
but maybe shoemaker was afraid he'd lose his paintg another way.
the hellmans.
those type of claims never really go away.
collectors tend to shy away from paintings with questionable histories for that very reason.
in other words, if the hellmans ever find more evidence to support their claim...
they could go right back to court.
he creates a fake to hedge his bet.
then he loaned it to the museum to get the break in the insurance premium.
shoemaker might even be trying to pull off a double scam - have the fake one stolen for insurance, right.
have the fake one stolen for insurance, right. And then sell the real one later on the sly.
why steal back the fake pissarro now?
I mean, it's been hanging on the museum wall for a year and a half.
Hey, wait, what that guy, that curator guy say...
it was going on tour. Next month.
which would have meant another authentication.
fool me once shame on you, fool me twice...
now the question is...
where is the real pissarro? - Right.
you can add, but you can't hide. - What's broken?
I've come with a peace offering.
french dip.
well, thank you, but you didn't have to do that.
there are a lot of things I don't have to do, charlie, but I just do them because I want to.
just feel like you worry about me too much, dad.
Charlie, look, you're a grown man, but you're still my son and I'm still your father.
okay, I-I-it's not about the house or chores.
it's, uh, it's about...
accepting responsibility.
dad, I'm A...
I'm a full-tened professor at one of the most prestigious universities in this country.
how do you think I got here, by slacking off?
you can do the math, charlie, we all know that, but, uh, sometime, you're going to want more for your life.
I know you can't see that right no but...
sometime, god willing, you're going to have to make a choice between one of your algorithms and one of your kids upstairs with the flu.
I have kid with the flu now?
Charlie, I look at larry, you know, a-anI respect him, but look at him-- he's all alone.
but look at him-- he's all alone.
I mean, he sleeps on couches, puts his work ahead of relationships.
you got to start somewhere.
the kind olife I'm talking about, it just doesn't happen by magic.
is that what this has been all about?
U're worried that I'm going to turn into larry?
I worry about that, too, sometimes.
yeah...
because I look around and i don't see the best role models.
for example, einstein.
einstein never had a home life. Eitein dumped his wife and married his cousin.
I hope that's not your way of making me feel better.
dad, I'm wrestling with all this, all of it.
my math, my work with don, amita.
I'm sorry, I just don't have it all figured out yet.
you have no right. - Actually, we have a warrant.
this is ludicrous. You're telling me that my painting is a forgery based on an analysis of a photograph?
a photograph that you submitted to the museum, and I spoke to your insurance company - they're going to withhold your payment.
Yeah, well, I'll take th to court.
I wouldn't count on the courts backing your play a seco time, Mr. Shoemaker.
the hellmans are behind this, aren't they?
they paid some sleazy math expert to look at photograph and say that my pissarro is a fake.
well, if they think they're going to get something out of this, they're wrong.
that's a really interesting theory, but the math expert works for us.
Why? Why would I steal my own painting?
and if it s a fake, why would the hellmans have fought for four years to get it back?
nothing so far. - Of course, there's nothing!
I didn't steal the painting and I never shot a gun off in my life.
my father was an honorable man who served his country.
he was not a criminal and neither am i so, where would someone like shoemaker hide that original?
if he is our guy, he's done a real goojob of eliminating the one witness who could pin the forgery on him.
who could pin the forgery on him. - By killing wheeler.
if he commissioned a fake, there's got to be a forger.
maybe our second witness.
find him, we find the killer.
won't be easy catching this guy.
I've met any number oforgers capable of work this good.
well, maybe he's been caught before.
maybe he even has a file.
that's a lot of names to run down.
well, what if we don't run down the names? What if we run down the paintings?
we have a photograph of the forged pissarro, right?
Yeah, and the bureau has a photographic database of other forgeries seized over the years.
so, we give the photograph to charlie, he can do an analysis against all the her forgeries.
if he can tell us pissarro didn't paint the fake, maybe he can tell us who did.
per your request, I compared my analysis of the forged pissarro to the fbi database of other recovered forgeries.
the algorithm identified one painting in the database that most closely reseles the handiwork our suspect to an accuracy rate of, like, 89. 9%.
all right, so you found him? - Oh, I definitely found him.
so who's our forger? - His name is gustav slberg.
well, where is he? - He's in a jewish cetery in budapest.
and he died in 1948.
so died 60 year ago?
Yeah, so the fake's at least that old then.
Interpol just faxed over the fi on gustav stolberg.
in 1946, he was convicted of fraud.
he died in prison two years later.
hungarian police seized what they believed tbe five forged paintings in his shop.
take a look at the list. Fourth title down.
the pissarro.
hungarian police assumed all five canvases were a fake.
right, but one wasn't.
so, we think that the real pissarro's been sitting in a hungarian police vaultor 60 years?
wouldn't surprise me. The communists never threw anything away.
they packed the piarro into a crate along with the other forgeries.
so Mrs.Hellman's father must have paid stolberg to paint the forgery and then gave him the original for safekeeping.
at least there's some justice; the nazis looted a fake.
it also means that shoemaker's probably telling the truth.
that he didn't know the pissarro was a forgery.
and maybe no one did.
look, the fact that that painting was stolen a month before it was supposed to go on tour can't be a coincidence.
wait a minute. Hold, the museum conservator.
Yeah.
if what you're saying is true, that the real pissarro has been found, - then I must have made a mistake. - A mistake?
but you've been doing this for 20 years.
the fact is, you lied to us, didn't you? You knew that pissarro was a fake the whole time.
now we're not just talking about a painting. A man is dead.
and you're looking at conspiracy to commit murder.
whatever y were paid, Mr. Holden, it's not enough.
paid?
you think my integrity would be for sale?
he said it would ruin us. We'd already announced the acquisition.
it's one thing to display a painting that's suspected of bei nazi looted art...
but to exhibit a forgery?
who said it would ruin you?
excuse me. Excuse me.
Holden gave you up, Ruiz.
spent my life devoted to the reputation of this museum.
killing a man's not going to do much for the reputation.
Wheeler was a charlatan.
he found out the painting was a forgery, he tried to blackmail you.
do you know how difficult it is for a museum like ours to actually acquire a pissarro?
Yeah, but you didn't actually acquire a pissarro, did you?
by the time patrick alerted me to the forgery, it was already too late...
the pissarro had put us on the map.
only the tour next month would have exposed you.
I thought if the painting had just.
disappeared-- what would be the harm?
shoemaker had his insurance and the museum would have had its future.
Yeah, it's not much of a future now, is it?
is this really necessary? - Yes, this is really necessary.
the hungarian police just delivered this.
it's yours, nana.
always has been.
I think your father clearly saw the writing on the wall with the nazis.
so he went to stolberg and commissioned a forry.
after all these years...
to think, even I was begning to question whether what I remembered was even true...
I hope this will give you a little bit of comfort.
you know, I can't imagine-- six years old
the world around you safe.
then one day everything disappears - parents, family, everything you know...
one painting can only give you back so much.
well, maybe for Mrs. Hellman, given the sdom of her years, that'll be enough.
Oh, hey.
what, you guys started without me, huh?
I'd think einstein would say we started with you.
just a different time and space, am I right?
I like that.
I've been taking a closer look at einstein lately.
what's to eat?
red meat on the barbecue.
provided we still have a barbecue.
did you got my note, we're out of propan
I thought u'd take care of it.
I'm kidding. We got a new tank, we're good to go.
all right... - no, no, no, stay, stay.
I got it.
you're gonna grill?
Yeah, you know, t-bone with mom's amazing A little corn on the cob.
you want some help? - No, no. Think I can handle it.
Charles, that is white corn.
Hey, you know how you told me about your mom'cousin not finding anyone.
Yeah.
what's the deal? Why can't Lapd handle this?
uh, she used to work for the Chinese consulate.
you know how those guys are 15 minutes after they find out she's dead, they'll have herapartment cleared out.
what did she do for the consulate? - Interpreter.
witnesses?
Yeah. It's a hit and run.
some say Tahoe, some say explorer.
no way to know for sure.
there's got to be at least a dozen bars in the area.
figure a d-u-hits her, panics, takes off.
no skid marks.
Nope.
any damage to these cars? - No.
lucky drunk.
Yeah, tell her that.
you know, they say there's nothin sexier than a man who knows how to cook.
well, what do you say, you agree?
I don't know. I like guys who are good a math.
well, actually I'm using differential geometry to perfect the chocate chip cookie.
that's right.
or is this in case the whole math genius thing doesn't work out?
it's for senior ditch day.
hmm. You mean senior beach day.
Yeah, when they're away, the underclassmen ll play. Remember, last year, they ransacked my office.
Yeah, so this year...
this year, I leave a peace offering for the hungry natives.
hmm, needs bigger chips.
so, I guess congratulation sare in order.
for?
it's a bit controversial, but I like it.
I mean, Larry used anon-standard analysis instead of the conventional borel approach in treating the singularities.
can I... just...
so Larry published an article...
on zero point energy and quan...
and quantum cosmology.
you didn't know?
well, I though the would have asked you to collaborate.
me, too.
coroner found paint chips under her skin. Color traces bk to the ford motor company.
they have a model yet?
either exploreror a jaguar. Better notify the locals.
if that suv was stolen, it's gonna be headed straight to a chop shop.
looks like Michelle Kim moved back and for the between here and China growing up.
we got a file on her?
Yeah, this is Granger, FBI, for Jackson.
no, but we have on her father.
okay, just have him come return it, thank you.
former Chinese diplomat. Retired in 97.
FBI counter intelligence ran a background check on her when she moved back into the country in '03.
counter intelligence? Why were they looking at her?
I don't know.
whoa, whoa, wait a second. Scroll back down there.
right there. That background check was filed by an old army buddy of mine.
Dwayne Carter. - Yeah.
Carter and I did a tour together in Afghanistan.
you guys still tight?
I've called him a few times, but he hast been around.
the guy saved my ass.
no alas. - Yeah, we were in this humvee together, got hit by an rpg and the thing just exploded into flames.
I got trapped, had this piece of metal just wrapped around my arm.
thought for sure my ticket was punched.
the man, he just...
jumped in, man, ripped me out of there and the dumb bastard, he got third-degree burns on his hand.
sounds like the guy to talk to.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Oh, I'm just gathering some information for a paper that Larry's working on.
Hey, you know, you guys have direct access through nasa's firewall.
that's right. Big brother's always watching.
Hey, is this the new case?
Yeah, it's a hit and run, but I don't know,
I'm thinking this is looking like something more.
something more like what?
well, like it's intentional.
okay, you need me to take a look at it?
no, it's all right, don't worry about it. - Because, you know, I-I...
I can factor in steady motion regimes
you know, body stiffness coefficients, and not to mention, you know, subtle body undations generated by the ground-reaction force.
you got me there. Go for it.
because, you know, was she walking, was she standing still?
I don't know. - How fast was she moving?
once you have that data, these impact marks can tell you a whole lot.
this is no problem for me to work... - Knock yourself out.
I'll have an answer for you as soon as I can. - You're the one who's always saying you're overworked hey. He'd it goat Kim's place?
I spoke to a couple of the neighbors.
she was quiet, kept to herself, no boyfriend.
what, you don't buy it?
she's 24 years old.
her last stop was one of the hottest nightclubs in L. A.
I have my doubts.
bartender remembers her getting a call right before she left.
Oh, yeah? Did it trace anywhere? - Didn't.
call came from a prepaid cell phone.
techs just lifted Kim's online bank account records.
got over a hundred grand in all-cash deposits.
well, the Chinese pay their interpreters really well.
got untraceable cell phones, cash deposits.
what was this girl into?
since when is the FBI interested in zero point energy?
huh?
are you checking Larry's work, Charlie?
I'm just looking-- just taking a look at it.
did he ask you to do that? - No, no.
what he's done is fairly impressive.
Oh, fairly impressi.
well, you kno what I mean.
no. What do you mean?
nothing. It has, it has great potential.
Yeah, but it needs your assistance.
to be honest with you...
Yeah. Yes.
Charlie, did you ever think that maybe Larry doesn't want you...
why wouldn't Larry want my help?
I don't know, but he sure didn't ask for it, did he?
first class soldier Granger, you son of a gun!
man. - What's up?
I practically had to put you under surveillance to find you.
Yeah, if I was easy to locate, I wouldn't be in counter intelligence now, would I?
what's up?
well, I caught this case-- Michelle Kim-- worked for the Chinese.
Yeah, they said somebody was coming up to talk toe, so I took a look at my report-- wasn't much.
any reason you guys we looking into her to begin with?
immigration flagged her. She entered the country with two passports, parents both Chinese nationals.
post 9-11. Thought was, we had to know wh she'd been up to on the mainland.
And?
she'd been in Beijing at university;
she came back to take a job with the hinese consulate as an interpreter.
everhing seemed on the up and up.
Why? You got something different?
she died last night.
died? - Yeah.
hit and run. Maybe more. That's why I want to ta to you.
Yeah, I don't know.
uh, I'll ask around. See what I can dig up.
okay.
how you doing?
adjusting. You?
Yeah, the same, I guess.
Yeah, never really goes away, does it?
no, never does.
al right, you catch something, give me a call, all right?
Absolutely.
come here! Come here!
it's great to see you. - U, too.
Ah, Charles.
say, did you know that an oort cloud has mass somewhere between five and a hundred times that of the earth?
oort cloud? Cloud that spits out comets?
Oh, yeah. Thousands of comets.
you know, I had, I had no idea.
Yeah.
so, I've, uh, come by here to congratulate you on your paper.
well, that was nothing.
nothing. Well, what you did, analyzing the effective weight of zero point energy in a nonstandard way, well, that-that could lead to a solution for the cosmological constant problem, right?
Yeah. Well, I mean, the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics does say that there must be some virtual mass, so...
I'm sorry, I'm running late here. - Oh, I'm, I'm curious.
um, who collaborated with you on the math?
Oh, stromsborg's good. - Yeah, he is. He is good.
Yeah, he's good.
uh, now, I'm sensing that there might be something more involved here than wl wishes.
Oh...
did you forget where my office was?
No! No!
stromsborg has so much experience in this field.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Yeah, but...
I'm so used to you coming to see me.
perhaps I was getting a little too used to it myself.
well, Larry, you know, I he I've never made you feel like...
Oh, absolutely not.
no, I just, I feel of late just a need to do some branching out, that's all.
branching out?
Yeah, well, I'm maybe like a comet trying to break out of its orbit, uh...
find my own escape trajectory, just come into my own entity, I don't know.
I'm so sorry, I'm running late, but, Charles,
I think I just need to stretch myself a little, that's all.
pure and simple.
I've been cleared by my ambassador to cooperate in any way.
I've also notified miss Kim's parents in Beijing.
you can imagine how difficult a call that was to make.
I hope you expressed our sympathies.
to have a child taken from you at such great distance...
but I suppose a traffic accident can occu anywhere in the world.
well, we're not so sure it was an accident.
I don't understand.
well, her job was an interpreter? - That's right.
any reason she'd have large sums of cash in her bank account?
her personal finances wouldn't be something I would have any knowledge about.
so that would be a "no"?
I'm afraid I didn't really know h very well.
we'd like to take a look at a list of people she worked with.
I'll speak with the ambassador, see what I can do.
Thanks. - Appreciate that.
What'd the consulate general have to say?
that he knew her less and less as we stood here.
well, either he's telling the truth or the Chinese have a very liberal hiring policy.
Why?
credit card has a bunch of charges to nightspots, lingerie boutiques and the occasional adult store.
which totally contradicts what the neighbors told me.
maybe you should run those through Lapd vice, narco...
you know, we're not even sure this girl was actually murdered yet.
um, yeah, actually, we are, as promised,
I do have an answer on whether or not this was accident.
I thought you had class.
I do. I have lunch and I...
look, you gu got, like, sandwiches around here?
we'll order out for you. - A nice turkey thing...?
what do you got?
all right, I tried using a steady-motion algorithm to try to determine the motion of your victim at the point of impact, but my results were indeterminacy.
but you persevered. - I did, I did.
you know, I imagined her walking, the motion of her feet, and then it occurred to me curtate cycloid.
Oh, curtate cycloid.
C. C. - Right, of course.
think of someone's, uh, someone's stride like the moon orbiting around the earth.
as the moon moves around the earth and the earth moves around the sun, the moon traces out a curtate cycloid curve in space.
in essence, creating a circle within a bigger circle.
now, when you walk, the heel orbiting backward then forward past the knee, creates the same pattern of circles.
now, from there, I could probabilistically determine the leg motion of your victim at the point of impact.
and that probabilistically helps us how?
well, the marks on her legs that the vehicle's lights made, - they're high. - High?
Yeah, the bumper of the vehicle was rising on impact.
so what, you're saying it was ccelerating?
which means this wasn't an accident.
Oh, no.
what are you say, megan?
morning.
so, washington wants us to ndle this on a local level.
okay. - How are we doing on that girl's account?
not very good.
all the deposits were made in cash just below the ten grand reporting minimum.
yeah? What about Colby's friend?
uh, Dwayne Carter said that Kim's background check was just routine.
a 24-year-old interpreter with that ki of money ain't routine.
ERT found this access card during a daylight sweep of the come scene.
kim's prints are all over it and it does not belong to the consulate.
or her apartment. I used a key found in her purse when i went the other night.
we got ert running it down right now.
Hey, you guys should have a look at this.
techs found something interesting on Michelle's laptop.
Megan said you guys got something.
Hey. Yeah.
Michelle Kim's computer.
seems like she had a thing for internet porn sites.
um, did she save any of the images from this web site?
Oh, yeah, she's downloaded quite a few images.
Why? What?
remember that image of the little girl we found hidden in the photograph?
right, the child porn case. - This is very similar.
it's only a lot more sophisticated.
this picture is really thousands of pixels reproduced as squares.
now could you ease zoom in on this portion of the photograph?
okay.
that's great.
all right, now remove some of these squares d you can still see the photo.
hover, a coded message can easily be hidden within this missing information.
Yeah, and?
well, you know those tests they gi people for colorblindness, e green dots?
to someone who's truly colorblind, all they see is a bunch of green dots, but to a person with perfect visn, the same exact image reveals a hidden picture.
so you think you can crack it?
uh, look, if there's a message in here, yeah, then I should be able to find it.
Yeah, it's a pass card for the building garage.
something happen?
you recognize this girl?
15-C.
she had an apartment here?
Yeah. Had?
what's going on here?
she was killed in an accident.
Oh, wow.
that's horrible. - You know how long she lived here?
two years, give or take.
she live alone or with someone?
uh, alone, I think.
I'd see her come in maybe one, two nights a week.
you guys keep the tapes to that camera?
it's all digital.
the footage gets online to a database somewhere for insurance or something.
so, Kim maintained a second apartment?
Yeah, under an alias. We checked it out.
there's no food in the fridge, no cable hookups.
what do you think? A meeting place?
the lobby has security cameras. Colby's checking out the footage right now.
you know, what amazes me here is that they're hiding their messages using the very same encryption programs that the privacy groups hired us to develop.
back when I was real little, I heard that the kgb and the cia used to send these encoded messages via shortwave radio.
I thought I was the only one. - Oh, no, you and me both.
Yeah, I'd be listening to these people talking in these languages I couldn't possibly understand.
I was imagining their operatives in paris and germany.
I even tried sending my own secret messages in response.
I never thought about doing that.
well, the police came to my house. - The police came?
Yeah, it was some anti communications regulations. I think they were police.
you know, that reminds me of that time that we rewired the P. A. System at princeton.
listen, I have to say it was rreshing to see your sense of humor that time.
it really S. Up till then, I was a little concerned that your natural intensity might well be your undoing.
it wasn't just about IQs.
our working together?
no, no, no.
I knew your sense of analysis suited my own.
you're making it sound like, like that's changed.
Charles, let's face it. Your passion has taken you down many new roads:
your work with don, your convergence theory...
my program's got something here.
Hey, look in the eyebrow.
I think those are numbers.
my algorithm was able to find an image embedded in, in this region here.
I e-mailed a jpeg to your techs.
they stripped away the extraneous squares, which then revealed a series of letters and numbers.
two letters an nine digits; can't be a phonenumber.
but it could be an international banking number.
it's definitely an offshore account.
cyprus. Check it out.
first two letters: C-y, that's the country code.
now, this next file is very interesting.
this is one that Kim posted of herself.
I gave it to your guys to isolate, as well.
it looks like a Chinese character.
Yeah. - Enhance that? Enhance that?
okay.
two names.
Terry evans," uh, and "richard freeman.
she file-shared the photograph from a chat room, but you know there's no way to trace who might he downloaded it, so...
evans and freeman were federal witnesses scheduled to testify against a guy named jason ming until they were murdered
double tap. That's center mass. This is not just a murder, it's a hit.
ming was arrested four months ago for selling laser gyroscopes to north korea for a Chinese contact.
so the next time the north kores fire a missile, maybe it hits north america and not the ocean.
ming posted a $3 million bail.
a week later the two witnesses against him were dead.
you know, these two witnesses' names were in a sealed indictment.
that's a paper file.
so someone physically had to get that info and give it to Kim.
only people with access to a sealed indictment are federal prosecutors.
and federal agents.
which means there's a mole in the department of justice, and if the Chinese have someone in the doj...
then they can get to any witness they want...
any case they want.
Hey.
man, Granger, you scared the crap out of me.
Michelle Kim-- the last time you saw her was two years ago?
I already told you that.
Yeah, tell me again.
it's boot camp.
they train you to put your shades on your back when you're approaching a target.
I guess old habits die hard.
I could bust your ass right now for lying to me!
she approached me after I did the background check, and we ended up sleeping together.
but that else it.
then why didn't you just tell me that fr the get-go?
why do you think I didn't tell you? I work counterintelligence.
I'm supposed to be following people like ki you're telling me that you knew she was a spy?
I had a pretty good idea, yeah.
how about an idea about killing witnesses who were going to testify against a fugitive on the U. S. Marshal's ten most wanted list?
think I had something too with that? - What do you want me to think?!
after I got back from Afghanistan, things with nny and me went south quick.
I ended up living in a small apartment with some judge telling me when I could see my son.
after I interviewed Michelle, she called me, and we met up a couple of times.
she showed me some attention, you know?
I knew better, but I went for it.
but that was all it was.
so when-when was the last time that you actually saw her?
not the night she was killed.
look, a-any of this becomes issue, I will come clean-- you have my word.
you'd be baked inside a Humvee if it wasn't for me.
you really think I'd screw you now?
you know, the number of espionage cases that we've prosecuted in the past decade has increased...
300%.
spies, huh? Is that what you're working on?
Yep.
Hey, did you know that nobody ever heard of James bond until president Kennedy confessed that he had read the Ian Fleming novels before going to bed?
did you know that?
what, you don't believe it?
well, this is more than fiction. Hey...
you ever have a problem with...
someone that you respected at work?
why, you having troubles at work?
Larry. - Larry?
he published his latest paper.
he didn't ask me to research.
well, I mean, with his experience, what has got to do, check with you?
well, okay, that's not the point. - Well, what is the point?
that his paper is good. It could be great.
with your help, huh?
well...
you know, there was a time at work, I was at the city planning office.
my, uh, my boss a design, and, um,
I don't know, I thought I saw something.
I mean, the plan was fine as it was, but
I thought that, um, I had seen something...
that I could make better.
What'd you do?
nothing.
because I had to decide which was re important, my relationship with my boss or with our client.
why don't you ask yourself this:
are you really ready to tell Larry that his work is good but just not good enough?
any luck finding more cameras in Kim's building?
no, these were the only ones, here in the lobby.
couldn't really tell which apartment the guests were going up to, and so far Kim's always been alone.
you know, um...
that might not be true.
What'up, Charlie? What are you doing here?
well, I'm just... working on something for Larry.
look, you said that the footage from these cameras is archived, right?
Yeah, that's right. - Okay, well, then, look, if the apartment is a meeting place, then chances are your mole has been there more than once.
Yeah, but, mean, there are months of footage and hundreds of guests.
okay, but we know when Kim was there, right? - Yeah, but so?
so I can run a series of eigenfaces.
Eigenfaces advanced facial-recognition techniques.
I've been working on a program that matches human asymmetry.
so I can create an algorithm that matches all visitors to the apartment at the times that we know that Kim was there.
asymmetry points? Come on, Charlie, help us out here, man.
no human face is perfectly symmetrica let's say that each little square of a rubik's cube represents a symmetry point
nose, ear or eye.
when the right combination is found, an individual symmetry point or body part is matched.
Hey, I just heard from the Lapd there's a chop shop in van nuys that has an suv that matches the one that hit our girl.
what's up? - Help you with something?
Yeah. You Tyler? - Yeah.
I want to get some rims.
what size? - 22'S.
how many you need? - Four of them would be great.
four rims. Means we've got four guys to deal with.
nice and chromed, if you can swing it.
chrome. Somebody's got a gun.
all right, let's go call it a thousand even.
FBI! You! Down!
Hey! You with the gun! Put it down!
Hey! Put t gun on the floor!
Hey! Don't! He dies, you die!
Oh, no, no! Here's how it goes!
I get out of here, or you both die!
David, shoot this dude.
will you just shoot him?! - Shut up!
drop him now! - Shut up! Shut up!
easy! Think.
think about it
there's no way out of here. You got no options. Put it down.
I mean it. David, shoot...
are you okay?
Yeah. Told you already, I'm fine.
that was a close call earlier, man.
comes with the territory, right?
just saying, an, that's not like you to not bring your "a" game, brother.
a guy gets a jump on me, and suddenly I'm losing it?
I just saying, man.
last couple of days you been kind of quiet.
I'm your partner, man-- if there's something on your mind, just let me know, okay?
look, david, I appreciate what you did in there, all right?
but I am fine.
see you tomorrow.
okay.
Hey, I got it. - Got what?
I-I got an idea on your mole.
that asymmetry model really paid off.
check this out.
this is your most likely suspect.
the past three months, Kim was at her apartment 24 times
eight of those times this guy shows up within an hour.
you sure about it?
Yeah, I mean, I'm very sure. Once I established this image,
I cross-referenced it with the photo I. D. Database at the department of ustice.
Oh... that's Dwayne Carter.
isn't that, like, Colby's army buddy in counterintelligence?
it's not like; it is.
Hey. Where is he?
he's on his way in.
what are you gonna do?
I don't know yet.
what, you got something you want to say?
don, if Colby withheld something, I'm sure he had a good reason for it.
where are we on the warrant for Carter's place?
the attorney general approved that this morning.
all right, well, as soon as they let us know he's out, we're going in.
sure you want to wait? We have enough to bring him in right now.
that's homeland's call
they want to find out more about the setup, see if there's any connection to the consulate.
well, so far the cash withdrawals from Kim's bank account correspond to a bunch of deposits that Carter made, but we haven't had any luck tracing Kim's source.
just keep digging.
Hey, you wanted to see me?
uh, yeah, you got that right.
all right, straight up, I want to know if you knew it was Carter on that tape.
I had a feeling, yeah.
you had a feeling, and you don't bring it to me?
don, the guy's a friend of mine. He made a mistake.
it had nothing to do with the case.
your friend is bought and paid for by the Chinese government.
I had no idea.
any money exchange hands between u two?
you lied to me-- I'm not exactly clear on the reason now.
I would never tank an investigation, don. You know that.
well, you crossed the line here.
what, and you haven't?
excuse me?
when megan was kidnapped-- you know what I'm talking about.
Yeah. To save a life?
Yeah, I was trying to save a buddy's career from going down the drain.
look, Dwayne admitted to me that he was sleeping with Kim, but he swore to me that it had nothing to do with our case.
he swore to you. Look, you're off the case.
is he still there? His biceps look pretty good. He should be in there a while.
now that you're done staring, we might be able to g the job done.
bathroom.
clear.
I got a computer in here.
hey...
they look like brothers there, don't they?
Yeah.
OK.
damn it, he's getting out already.
no, no, I need more time. - How about 45 seconds?
wasn't it 46?
44. Come on.
I'm coming.
come on.
Yeah, I'm coming.
Hey, is-is Charlesere?
uh, no.
good. That's good.
that's very good.
can I get you something?
Hey, look at this.
why, to graduate Princeton at 16!
I was good, but...
it took me till the more normal age of 19.
Ah, well, in that first year, we heard an awful lot about professor Fleinhardt.
Yeah.
you know, he spent half the time trying to prove the T. A.'S thesis was wrong.
well, Charlie was never afraid to give his opinion.
Yeah, well, of course, Charles was right.
is there something bothering you, Larry?
Charles is having trouble understanding why
I didn't ask for his help on this recent paper that I published.
Oh? - Yeah.
I mean, it's not that I don't value his input. I mean, you know that I do.
But?
Alan, Charles's work at the FBI increasingly consumes him.
Yeah, we know that, but...
in my field, dependence on any one person, at can spell the end of a career.
and I'm just not ready to go.
not yet.
you know, there's also something called pride, and I've never found that a great justification for anything.
the contingent came.
bank manager inadvertently tipped Carter off that subpoenas are being served on his accounts.
well, is that your way of saying he gone?
Yeah, he knows we're on to him.
all right, if Carter's on the run, then he has access to all kinds of fake ids, passports.
Yeah, but we have his money. - Just let me ask you this:
you think he's the type of guy who's gonna hang around for like one last score?
I'd buy that. He probably has the name of every FBI informant working against the Chinese.
we have the consulate covered, so there's no way he's gonna make contact there.
I mean, it could be pre-arranged, right? Look, he's meeting her on a regular basis.
Yeah, but that was at the apartment.
Yeah, but at some point, his handlers got to want to meet him, they got to want to check him out.
and there's no way she's gonna bring them all to that apartment.
you know, Carter's pda had a bunch of meetings on company time that the bureau couldn't explain.
Yeah, you got the times?
they're all like 11: 00 to 1: 00.
well, you have, uh, the locations of the meets here?
they're spread throughout the city.
you knon what, do me a favor, e-mail them to Charlie, maybe he can come up with something.
we're worried that Carter's going to try and sell whatever information he's got before he leaves the country.
and these appointments from Carter's pda are meetings between him and the Chinese?
we think so.
well, a lot of these are adrsses are within a couple miles of the FBI.
now I've learned from the nsa that operatives will often schedule meeting places, like, monthsn advance.
they're given a list. And no two meeting places are ever the same.
okay, so we can then logically assume that the meeting place is somewhere inside this circle?
right.
it's a classic combinatorial optimization problem.
no one is better at combinatorics than you.
who else could be?
it's simply a question of branching and bounding.
branching and bounding?
so you're trying to predict how a tree is going to branch.
and you know where six of the branches' meeting places already are.
now where will that seventbranch-- carter's next meeting place-- be?
certain factors can help us eliminate potential branches.
like, we know that Carter has to make a clean and fast getaway.
see, these meetings are taking place in areas that are zoned for businesses with open courtyards, with promenades, with multiple entrances and exits.
one was pershing square...
and one was the staples center. They're both close to the freeway, easy getaways.
right, and so, by running an algorithm that analyzes the features of the existing meeting places to find key variables, then by applying a branching and bounding algorithm, we can hopefully identify where Carter's next meeting place will be.
okay, thank you.
Sinclair for eppes. - Go for eppes.
SoG's got nothing on the other locations Charlie's list.
all right, just give it time, you know?
I thought Carter took all of his meetings during the daytime.
that's why it's called probability.
wait, hold on.
Yeah, I got eyes on him.
Hey, that's chen the guy from the consulate.
I don't know, he looks pretty calm. I don't think he knows we're on him.
don, Carter just passed him something.
all right, let's follow him. Don't move on.
Bravo team take chen outside the park. We got Carter.
all right, he's turning right onto broad.
stay back, everybody. Wait for me, wait for me.
copy that, david? - Copy that.
all right, wait. He's going eastbound into the second strt tunnel.
David, let's box him in.
block Road 23.
I want you to lock up the east end of the second street tunnel.
it down right now.
get your hands out of the windows!
get your hands out of the windows now!
driver, keep your hands out of the window, open the door and step toward my voice.
nice and easy. Just step toward my voice.
Dwayne, you don't want us pulling u out of that car.
I do it, Don't shoot.
come on. David.
come on.
you've got to be kidding me.
Colby was right, this guy is good.
here, catch.
unbelievable
chen isn't talking to anyone, and the state department's certainly not going to lean on him.
they've got bigger stakes with china.
we've got surveillance on the airports, public and private.
border patrol has a copy of Carter's profile.
guy works in intelligence ten years, he's not taking public transportation.
don, Carter has an exit plan, Colby is our best chance at figuring it out.
Yeah, Colby's not on the case. I mean, I can't trust him.
whatever happened between him and Carter blurred his judgment.
why don't you let david try and call him?
I already tried. Got his voicemail.
guy's got something to say to me, he knows where I am.
guess you got to keep the boat in the divorce settlement.
do me a favor and untie that bow line.
a guy who loves the ocean, I never could understand why you chose to go to the desert.
if I hadn't, you'd be dead.
they took my badge, my gun.
then there's nothing keeping you here, right?
look, I got something to sell that'd be enough for the both of us.
Yeah, and how many people are gonna die this time?
you killed two innocent witnesses.
and Michelle Kim?
when met her, I must've looked like a deer caught in the headlights.
I mean, this girl, she was all over me.
at first, it was just drinks and sex.
Yeah, and then what?
I was only giving her useless information. And every money gave it went to my kid.
no, the information you sold her killed two federal witnesses.
a murderer went free because of it.
she blackmailed me.
she told me if I didn't steal high-level information, she would expose me.
so, what, you killed her to save your ass?
I saved your ass once.
you remember?
at help am I to my son if I'm in prison?
there was nothing I could do.
I didn't have any other choice.
you got a choice now.
you can come in with me.
it's not gonna make anything right, but it might just give your kid one chance at least to forgive his father.
what if I don't? Huh?
you were one of the bravest soldiers I ever knew, Dwayne.
No!
come on, give me the tape. Give me the tape.
you gonna kill me?
go ahead, man. Go ahead.
put down!
drop that gun! Colby, jink!
I can't believe you did this to me!
drop that gun! - Put it down!
drop it!
no. No, Dwayne...
no, you did it to yourself.
Dwayne Carter. Drop that gun! Put it down!
hands up! Now!
hands up!
you know, I've never been in combat.
but I've been in my share of fire fights and you know what scares the he out of me?
it's not dying.
it's letting my guys down.
you know? Losing trust.
you do it again, you're going to jail.
still trying to untie yourself.
ere's over 70 precise moves with this.
well, they don't call it the world's toughest brain teaser f nothing.
you know, I used to able to do these in under two minutes. W, it's over six.
Oh, that's still pretty good.
Yeah. It's not my best.
neither was hiring Stromsborg as my collaborator.
Larry, we've discussed this, Stromsborg's good.
Yeah, t he's not the best.
what I fort to keep in mind was the paper meant nothing.
you see, it was all about the work.
or should've bee speaking of work,
I could still use your help... if it's not too late.
I have a confession to make.
yeah?
I already read the paper.
Oh. And?
you want me to be honest with you? - No, I don't.
I want to remain a blithering idiot. Yes, of course, I want your honesty.
I never want to lose you as a friend.
and you never shall.
your paper...
it's a work of genius.
okay, now there. Was that so hard?
but... - but...
it would have benefited from the work of two geniuses.
Yeah. Simon and Garfunkel, perhaps?
okay. Fine, yes.
as long as I'm Simon.
well, Charles, ever the pragmatist.
I got a 35-year-old white male.
pushed or jumped off the south side of this building 90 minutes ago.
was dead on impact.
any witnesses?
no, but they ID'd him.
he's the Assistant US Attorney Peter Weyburn from the Tenth Circuit in Kansas.
Yeah, that's a long way to come to commit suicide.
I'd say, for an unmarried civil servant in the tax department, perfectly clean record.
his family, his office has no idea what he was doing in California.
let's see if we can find out why he was here, and if anyone had any grudges.
Where's Liz? I thought she was filling in for David.
Yeah, in-service training.
I can't talk right now. I'll call you back.
Hi.
my publicist wants me to do interviews, you know?
and I told her, I said, I can't start the book tour till next week.
uh, that's because The Attraction Equationis blowing up.
I checked. It's on the top 100 on Amazon.
it made the top 100?
can I leave this stuff here, because, um,
I-I don't want to take it to my class, and I'm running really late.
what do you mean, you don't want your students wondering why you bring fancy underwear to work?
no. Thank you.
I would prefer they stay focused on the combinatorial matrix theory.
um, your dad is going to be gone tonight, right?
so we have the house to ourselves?
I've been thinking. Why don't you move in with me already?
you mean, with-with the both of you?
well, my father won't mind. We can work that out.
is it something you'd want to do?
Yeah, um, it just.
you know, Charlie, this is not just a romantic question.
I mean, this is something we need to talk about when our heads are clear, and we're calm, and I-I'm not calm right now, because I'm running really, really, really, really, really late to class.
Hi. Welcome back.
so, I'll see you at lunch?
Bye. -Bye.
Bye.
Charles, you look like someone stole your chalk.
welcome back.
well, look, I agreed to teach one seminar this term.
you're moving out of the monastery.
Yeah.
one stride at a time.
come on.
more conscious walking?
you know, a visiting Vietnamese monk, he led us on a conscious walk.
it took us three hours just to cross the garden.
three hours?
well, I mean, deliberating upon each single step, it slows the metabolism, deepens the focus.
it's more mundanely, it helps you sidestep dog excrement.
it's a most worthy exercise.
sometimes I think you're better off taking the leap.
Oh, how I've dreaded this moment.
okay. Here it is, just like you left it.
Oh, my.
I - I cannot take one more step.
well, what's the matter?
I - I'm overwhelmed. I'm literally overwhelmed.
Oh, the memories?
for five months, I've needed nothing that I couldn't carry on my back.
this.
this is obscene.
who is this person that belongs to this mess?
don, I got something.
what have you got?
well, looks like a bunch of kids stuff.
I'm guessing someone who lives in the building put it up here?
well, log it in anyway, you know?
my legal right, according to California Statutes.
hold-hold on there. What-what's going on?
this is Anthony Braxton. He was sneaking up here from the next building over.
sneaking is not accurate. I'm in pursuit of the Primal Key.
what?
you found the GPS-cache.
do you know if Weyburn got to it?
wait. You know who Weyburn is?
Yes. He's the head of our alliance.
what alliance?
the Midwestern Ax-Butchers.
the MMO?
it's a PVP RPG with an integrated ARG in its last 72 hours.
what are you talking, like video game stuff?
Yeah, a video game.
we're competing in an ARG endgame for a $1 million prize.
what? Get off of me, man!
Where's Peter?
Mr. Weyburn's dead.
what?
wait. Is-is this real?
you mean-you mean dead, like his physical body is.
Yeah, like in real life.
I've never seen an actual dead person before.
I've-I've killed thousands online, but.
so, you didn't like the idea of splitting the prize money with him, is that it, Anthony?
what?
where were you for the last two hours?
I'm on his team.
I wouldn't do anything. -Anthony, what is this?
that's just my handheld electronic reader. Aim it around.
aim it at the bottom right corner of that graphic across the street.
what is this?
alternate reality.
Hey, Charlie, I'm, like, halfway through your book, and the stuff on relationships is great.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Amita, thanks so much for coming down. -Sure.
well, just eyeballing it, I can tell you that unless this guy got a running start, he was pushed.
who was he?
uh, the Assistant US District Attorney, Peter Weyburn from Kansas, and we'd really like to rule out a suicide if possible.
well, we'll take a look at it.
okay. Uh, he was here playing some kind of an alternate reality game.
it's called Privacy?
you know it?
Yeah. I play it.
you do?
Yeah, since I was an undergraduate.
what can you tell me about it?
the alternate reality game is temporary.
it's used to promote the MMORPG, which goes on for years.
the MMO what?
the Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game.
basically, you're a character, and you fight in battles and go on quests, stuff like that.
you know, Amita, I think you're going to be better at decoding this crime scene than I am.
you guys want to head up, and I'll let them know you're coming?
sure.
Hey, how do I not know this about you?
Oh, cause we only play a few hours a week.
uh, who's we? We who?
uh, me and my alliance.
so, an alliance.
well, what-what. How.
you-you never told me you had an alliance.
what is. what is an alliance?
uh, just old friends, you know.
we've been playing the video part of Primacy for years, since we were undergrads.
it helps us keep in touch.
how come you never asked me to be part of your alliance?
well, honestly, I thought you would make fun of me. I mean, it's kind of whimsical.
I can be extremely whimsical.
I do lots of things on a whim.
Hey, you guys. -Hey.
I have no idea what I'm looking at here.
she does. -What's the deal?
an alternate reality game. ARG.
is a treasure hunt played out in the real world, using actual media.
well, give me a good old-fashioned foot chase any day.
now, what is this thing?
okay, well, this device is an optical scanner with software downloaded from the game company.
you see, a lot of gamers just use cell phone cameras.
the numbers are a clue in.
if it was a website, it would log on automatically, letting the game mainframe know where I'm located and giving me points, but it's not doing that, so, it could be GPS.
or quite possibly a simple hexadecimal alphabet code that translates to "the beach.
maybe you should be part of my alliance.
I'm going to start my own alliance.
and you just did that in your head like that?
I wouldn't be as fast in a foot chase.
what do we think the shape means?
Argentina?
I'm thinking it's the map of some zip code area that includes a beach.
you see, alliances follow clues online and in the real world to locate the Primal Key.
the Primal Key?
Yeah. A hidden object. It's the Holy Grail of the game.
it's worth a million bucks.
how many people do you think are competing for it?
I don't know. I would guess several thousand.
Oh, that's a lot of suspects.
well, correct me if I'm incorrect, but we could develop an evolutionary algorithm that searches the game's history for abnormally aggressive activity.
Aggression's part of the game.
killing real people isn't, right?
Yeah, that's true. People aggress in video games in similar ways.
killing monsters, going on raids.
see, and this algorithm would recognize any typical activity and just ignore it.
it would seek out the abnormal actions.
uh, think of a pond.
a pond is a healthy ecosystem where predator and prey are in balance.
however, if an outside predator is introduced, well, then, the ecosystem changes.
an evolutionary algorithm highlights abnormal alterations.
it discerns subtle patterns and locates the source of a problem.
well, then give me an example of abnormal aggression within the game?
I'm not sure. Uh, players who would attack for sport rather than points.
Griefers.
or somebody who stays up for days straight playing is called a camper.
listen, if I could get access to Primacy's server, well, then,
I can analyze patterns and identify players who are most likely to cross from virtual to actual killings.
I'll get us a warrant for the server.
Yeah, hey, what do you think these are?
signature trinkets.
a record of the people who've been up here.
your fingerprints are all over this.
so you were up on that roof before. Why did you lie?
you're the man.
I was quaking in my boots, I'm ashamed to say.
what happened?
you met Weyburn, and you got in an argument, things got physical, is that it?
and then he fell off the roof?
no.
I never met Peter in person.
yesterday was going to be the first time.
I, um, I only knew him online as our alliance leader, Tycon-Z.
and when were you up there? -Yesterday.
um, I was gathering recon data in case I could aid Tycon-Z in his first foray into the LA epicenter.
where were you this morning?
at my job. Um, Paco's Tacos on Pico.
yeah? Who set up the meet, you or Weyburn?
well, it wasn't actually set up. He.
he told me to stay away, but I had to see him.
Tycon-Z is awesome.
and what do you mean he told you to stay away?
we suspected Shadowhound Brigade of cheating.
he went there to confront them.
who? The what? -Shadowhound Brigade.
they're vicious, immoral dogs, capable of entrapping and destroying noble warriors using devious and unfair methods.
you understand we're talking about a real person here, okay?
who's really dead.
I know.
the game is my coping mechanism.
we think your company's game was involved in Weyburn's death.
we're in the last 72 hours before somebody wins a million dollars, and we can't afford bad publicity.
so are you sure this Weyburn dude didn't just slip and fall off the roof?
that'd be far preferable.
uh, Mr. Moore. -Binky.
your name is "Binky"?
like the pacifier.
right, Binky.
uh, the "Weyburn dude" works for the Department of Justice, so we're going to have to investigate his death whether it's convenient for you or not.
got it.
how many players on Primacy?
worldwide, five and a half million.
uh, at any given moment, we might have a couple hundred thousand players logged in for the Primacy MMORPG, the online part of the game.
and most of them don't know about the ARG, the alternate reality aspect of Primacy, which essentially works like a scavenger hunt in the real world, for a money prize.
we've got 5, 000 or 6, 000 players competing in that, mostly local.
okay, I'm going to need access to your server.
my information's protected by privacy laws, trade secrets.
search warrant.
I'd like to start with the IDs for Weyburn group as well as the Shadowhound Brigade, and I'm going to need names to go with these.
so is this trinket your signature in the Primacy game?
and when were you on the roof?
yesterday afternoon, before my grandkids got off school.
did you know Peter Weyburn?
never heard of him.
can you verify your whereabouts this morning?
I was at work till noon.
ask my supervisor.
is the game still on?
me and my partner really need this million bucks.
the money is incidental.
I get satisfaction from reading signs invisible to the rest of society.
where were you this morning between 8: 00 and 10: 00?
I'm in my office by 6: 00 a. m. every day for the opening of the east coast market.
so the alibis check out.
Yeah, I don't think the killer left his signature trinket up on the roof.
what about the Weyburn alliance?
all good, including the Braxton kid.
so Megan's trying to ID the Shadowhound Brigade now.
Hey, so what's going on with Liz?
Ah, I don't know. You know how it is.
not really, man. I haven't had a serious date in, like, two years.
what, two years?
la's tough, man, even when you're not working undercover with the Chinese.
Pharaoh861, one of the ten members of the Shadowhound Brigade.
Colby, will you call that number? -Yep.
what about the others?
I've tried three of them so far and none of them have pictures on the profile page, which is unusual, and none of them are answering their phones.
see if anybody answers here.
it's such a shame about my own office.
I can kind of understand that.
Yeah, I sense a big, hairy "but" coming.
Ooh, pardon my terrible pun.
what do you want to do with your life, Larry?
seriously, you want to take the same three hour walks across the same garden?
Hey, don't look askance.
admit it, Larry.
I mean, you're more interested in the world than that.
well, I have received a rather tantalizing offer to join the D0 team searching for the Higgs boson.
well, all right, the God particle.
which would be a continuation of your spiritual seeking as well as your quest for unified theory.
well, faith in science is still faith, is it not?
that's very cool, Larry.
I think you should continue with your search for supersymmetric particles.
imagine smashing protons at 99. 99% of the speed of light all to locate a single fragment which would move us one step closer to unifying all physics, explaining how the Old One created the universe.
what could be more spiritual?
not a trivial activity.
no, and neither is conscious walking, Charles.
okay, the normal behavioral parameters for the game are set.
all right, great, let's run this program, see if we can't locate any players that are acting abnormally.
okay, I'll be back after my seminar.
Bye-bye.
Bye, Larry.
okay, how is it she knows so much about this game?
she's been playing Primacy with an online group of people for years.
Really?
did you know this?
what was that sound? What is that?
I wonder if she might be in the midst of one of those online friendships, unconsummated, but emotionally intimate?
Hello, Ruby.
I've said that I would prefer not to.
okay, okay, ten minutes, but this has got to be the only one, right?
thank you.
morning TV interview.
I have the willpower of a field mouse.
but within that field, you're a very popular mouse.
no answer there, either.
all right, well, let's go to Bulldog472.
Max Barnes. 347 Trilson Street in Culver City.
and there's no photo of him, either.
okay, I got him right here. Max Barnes, age 93, deceased November,'06.
well, that's six fake screen names for the Shadowhound Brigade.
Yeah, this alliance doesn't really exist.
Hey, this was posted to the Primacy Web site three hours ago.
Wolftrax says it was hacked in, uploaded from an outside server.
the Primacy bloggers think it's some kind of a hoax.
that it has an embedded clue for the ARG endgame.
does it? -Not according to Binky Moore.
I'm going to let my algorithm search the server history for embedded clues and patterns and we'll see what shows up.
Where's my brother?
he had a lunch meeting.
I don't know. I mean.
it's not really Liz. I mean, look, she's a great girl, right?
you know, it's just.
it's the whole thing of keeping work and-and our relationship separate, I think.
you know, your mother and I met while working together.
it's a little different in my case, don't you think?
well, people always fall for each other at work.
it's where you spend most of your time.
if your heart's not in it, you can't stay.
that wouldn't be fair to either one of you.
and if you feel like ending it, then I doubt it's because of the job.
Uh-huh, all right.
you know what, Dad, I've got to take this, okay, so, um.
I'll talk to you later. Thanks for lunch.
Donnie, she works with you.
you have to straighten it out.
I know.
primacy, the ARG, has been underway for a month.
the vertical lines behind me represent alliances.
the horizontal lines are the alliances' attacks.
two weeks ago, there were seven alliances running neck-in-neck for the million dollar prize.
and until that point, Primacy operated like any good game, with leaders surging and ebbing in expected patterns.
ten days ago, a whole different story emerges.
anytime an alliance holds the lead for more than 36 hours, it suddenly drops out, never recovering.
so someone forced them to quit.
well, the players don't know who's in the lead, so either it's someone inside the company or a high-end hacker.
four of the seven front-runners are out.
Weyburn's group dropped away with his death, leaving two alliances:
the Readymades and the Shadowhound Brigade as potential winners of this thing.
and potential suspects.
this Shadowhound is the phony alliance.
six out of ten are deceased. We have four more to account for.
and they can't all be fake. I mean.
someone's playing these avatars.
Yeah, and someone would have to show up to claim the prize money.
I can play the game, you know, and try to interact with the avatars.
Yeah, you know, and if she gets a hit, I'll track the Internet providers for a location.
great.
how hard would it be for someone who works for Primacy to set this all up?
well, there are powerful firewalls to prevent inside cheating.
unless.
unless it's the creator himself.
where were you yesterday morning, Mr. Moore?
networking breakfast at the Biltmore. About 300 witnesses.
you sold Wolftrax to Kuma Games 18 months ago, right?
I built Wolftrax up from freeware to a sale for a nice chunk of change.
now, I'm president in name only.
why didn't you just walk away?
I'm not interested in money.
Really?
we're creating the future. And people are sleepwalking.
but it is the new literacy.
knowledge isn't in books anymore.
it's in electronic media and Joe Blow in Idaho doesn't know how to access it.
but when he plays an ARG, we're teaching him the Dewey decimal system of the Digital Age.
Yes, and advancing our business.
which is why I put up the million dollar prize myself, to motivate people.
well, you certainly did that, huh?
I knew we had a rogue alliance.
groups in the lead were getting intimidated.
physically?
no. Spamming, jamming, online raids. we had complaints.
I fully thought the game would self-regulate.
I can't believe this is happening to my game.
Oh, my God, that's Binky Moore!
you are a god! -Slave-boy, let's go.
can I get his autograph?
you're going to have to adore him from afar.
the nerds love me.
I can't get anyone from the Shadowhound Brigade to play me.
Kali, Goddess of Destruction?
I picked it when I was 19, okay?
she's remarkably. hot.
well, sexy avatars get treated nicer.
okay, this guy's not online. Who's next?
uh, let's see.
we've got.
spectre.
no.
my publicist wants me to show up early for that TV interview so they can put makeup all over my face.
I think you'd look cute with eyeliner.
yeah? Thanks.
Hey, so you going to move in or not?
spectre's online.
he's battling for control of a transport station.
let's see if we can get a track on the IP and.
get a real-world location.
finally, a real, live member of the Shadowhound Brigade.
Spectre?
all right, I got him.
Yeah, Frank. Riegert.
all right, you keep him playing. We're on our way.
Frank Riegert, FBI, open up!
let's go, Frank, open the door.
clear.
Oh, damn.
Megan, he's dead.
smells like he was electrocuted.
clear.
colby? -Yeah.
it's operating itself.
Frank Riegert's dead.
what?
his computer is running the game without him.
a zombie? No, then Riegert's not Spectre.
I mean, whoever the real Spectre is controlling his computer from somewhere else.
are you tracing his Internet location?
he's using dynamic IPs; he's routing through dozens of servers.
you know, it's sort of like, um, like.
changing stolen cars every few blocks.
you know, when a car thief is in a hurry. -I got it, I got it.
I stole his mojo bag. Hold on, I have to get out of here.
she stole his mojo.
okay.
now I get to see what he's hiding.
is that GPS? -Yeah, 0600. 6: 00 a. m.
Hey, Megan, we've got a game clue for another location.
Northgate Dam.
all right, we'll check it out.
you'll need us to figure out clues at the location.
we can call you.
you couldn't decode the roof clues.
you could be at the site for hours and not see anything.
point taken.
guys, do me a favor and stay behind me.
so, listen, with that GPS you got there, you've got 15 feet of uncertainty at every location.
all right, Amita, you see anything with that X-ray vision of yours?
no, but with my naked eye I see a misaligned arrow, which is a classic ARG clue.
it's 6: 00 now.
what about those rocks?
you know, the way they're arranged. couldn't that be a clue?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, there's something down here.
wait, wait, wait, hold on.
what? -Hold on, yeah.
what are you doing? -Look, Charlie, there's something else down here.
well, be careful, okay? -Okay.
it's a symbol.
Yeah, this is definitely part of the game.
what is that?
go back up the ladder!
back! Get up quick!
call Don!
Oh, God, oh, God!
Colby! -Don, we need help.
Colby's been swept away at the Northgate Dam.
grab my hand! -Charlie, be careful!
come on, hang on!
come on!
reach! Reach!
I got you!
just reach!
you okay?
we got to get you to a hospital. -I'm okay.
spectre tried to kill us.
Yeah.
what's up with you and the water?
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for asking, Megan.
it was a setup.
Yeah, definitely. I mean, that dam releases overflow every morning.
how are you doing? You really okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
so Spectre set up a false clue.
Yeah, I mean, whoever gets ahead of him gets intimidated or they get killed.
now, did Spectre kill Riegert, do we know?
well, we got e-mails on his computer.
they were accomplices, they were definitely trying to steal the million bucks, but after Weyburn was murdered.
Riegert got cold feet.
Yeah, Riegert wanted the money.
it was Spectre that had other plans.
he was intending to open some kind of a new game called Chain Factor with his prize money.
all right, so Spectre and Riegert were the only two real people in the Shadowhound Brigade.
and now it's just Spectre, right?
Yeah, who kills people by faking accidents, and I don't think this is a guy with a previous criminal record.
I think this is his first foray.
I - I just think he's a fanatic in the midst of a manic obsession, and if that's the case, it's only going to intensify as he gets closer to the prize.
all right, well, then, we got to shut down the game.
Yeah, we do that, he's got no reason to show up.
Yeah, but. if we leave it going, he's going to mow down anyone that gets in his way.
Hey, I know how to trap this guy.
yeah? Does it involve your deceptive upper body strength?
that was pure adrenaline.
listen, to win, Spectre has to play the game, right?
we control the game, we control Spectre.
we hack the hacker.
shut it down and somehow make him think it's still on?
no, we don't have to shut it down.
look, it's like a train yard.
every player in this game is a train coming into our station and we send them all through, but when we see Spectre's train approaching, we sidetrack him without affecting the rest of the players.
how do we trick him into thinking he's playing the real game?
a mirror site.
okay, it's like one of those fake bank pages that scammers put up to steal personal data.
look, I'm gonna call the game company,
I'm gonna get them to work with me on this, and we're going to set up the mirror site here.
all right, that sounds good, go for it.
and you know.
Amita can play him online, but, uh, no more fieldwork for her.
where do you want them?
end of the daisy chain.
translation? -That would be right there.
all right, you guys, so just hit a bunch of random keys, all right, that'll make the site look alive.
it'll make it look like hundreds of people are accessing it, okay?
as we lead Spectre to the final clue for the Primal Key, fewer people would be around.
Yeah, we can't let him win too easily.
don't worry about that.
I'm going to get a few shots into this guy myself.
and then we're going to let him win.
Yeah, we will be the swarming multitudes.
you are to fight Spectre and then.
he wins the final clue, taking him to MacArthur Park for the Primal Key.
and then we arrest him.
okay, so everybody's ready, right?
here we go.
come on. Where is this guy?
spectre won't attack until we take the lead.
braxton, grab that ax, chop down that wall; there's something behind it.
on it.
good eye, oh, Captain, my Captain.
okay, he doesn't want me in here.
that's him, that's Spectre.
that's an ugly avatar.
Oh, he's talking to me, in-game chat.
I can voice it.
Kali, surprised to see you.
were you unable to decipher the clue you stole from me?
I'm working on it.
I want my mojo back.
come. and get it.
can you trace in-game chat?
all right, just let him kill you so he can get the clue and head over to the park.
no, the fight's got to look real.
heal me. Heal me, I need my arm.
I'm healing you as fast as I can.
Kali, you are finished.
let him win. -Easy now.
he's behind you!
you killed him.
Oh, my God.
damn it, Amita!
I'm so sorry.
it was reflexive. I - I can't believe I did that.
all right, what now?
well, um, I could IM him, get him to meet me.
my suggestion: we do nothing.
now, losing one battle is not going to deter him, not if he's a zealot.
Kali is the focus of his rage and the obstacle to his goal.
he'll get in touch with you.
so what now, we just wait?
can he even. talk to you in-game w- when his avatar's dead?
Yeah, I mean, that's the only way he can talk to Kali is in-game chat.
sorry, that's me.
I have to go do that ridiculous TV interview.
all right, so what's the plan if Spectre makes contact?
we set up a meeting. -No.
no more meeting her in the real world, please.
no. No, no, not me. Kali.
Yeah, he doesn't know what she looks like in person.
it could be me.
right, I mean, it could be me.
well, I'm just saying, it could.
I'd be honored if you'd consider joining our alliance, or at the very least, giving me your e-mail address.
Anthony, you've been really helpful.
I'll be back as soon as possible.
okay, I'm going to get you a ride home.
Bye, Anthony, thanks.
Bye, Charlie, have fun. I'll be watching.
you didn't have to do this. I - I really appreciate it.
Charlie, this is a treat for me.
besides I can't help it, I'm proud of you.
well, you know, getting up all early and all. It's just, you're always there for me and Don.
I should buy one of those plastic "World's Best Dad" statues.
you're buttering me up.
well, I'd like to broach a certain topic.
go ahead.
I would like Amita to move in with us.
you getting married?
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.
I know how things go these days.
Yeah, sure, she should move in.
besides I've been thinking about those condos.
really, I mean, it's a good time to buy. The prices are coming down.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have to move out. Not yet.
well, what does Amita say?
we're in discussions.
Oh, that's, uh, that's good. Uh, that's great.
what if he doesn't make contact?
well, should Kali send him a message?
Oh, he expected to win, now he has to rethink his plan.
he's got no other play but to be in touch with Kali.
well, we've got no other play here if he's not.
Oh, it's me. Must be Charlie.
Hello?
I want the key.
spectre.
how did you get my phone number?
I know who you are. Amita.
I need a trace on a cell phone.
why should I talk to you? I mean, I know where the Primal Key is.
I have a proposal.
believe me, you'll come out better.
maybe, maybe not.
regardless, I'm not talking about this on the phone.
you at your computer?
Why?
triple click on your avatar.
how did you do that?
I want the key.
okay, um.
meet me at MacArthur Park at. at 7: 00 a. m.
what-what do you look like?
Rything about me.
well, not everything. He seems to think you're a regular player.
what if he's just setting me up?
Amita, we can pull this off without you.
what if you don't get him?
he knows my address, he knows my social security number.
I mean, I think Spectre will only show if I go.
we'd have undercover agents, and snipers, and you'd wear a two-way earpiece so we could talk.
what if he knows I'm working with you, and he just.
you'd have a bulletproof vest.
a bulletproof.
you know, I really think we should consider the alternatives here.
with the sting, we made her Spectre's only rival.
she's our best chance, Larry.
but is she not allowed to decline?
I'll do it.
I think we need to talk to Charles.
no. Let him finish his interview in peace.
and this whole thing will be over before he even hears about it.
with us this morning is Dr. Charles Eppes from CalSci.
he's written the first math book you're gonna want to read, The Attraction Equation.
can you tell us how to find a mate using math, Dr. Eppes?
Oh, well, you can call me Charlie. You don't have to.
Oh, I've developed a new kind of math, it's, um, sort of a calculus of human relationships.
it's based in decision theory.
and it can help.
it can help people choose a better partner by mathematically predicting which couplings have the best chance at success.
can you tell me why I keep picking the wrong guy?
well, you might need to, uh, put a little logic into your romantic equations, I guess.
Oh, maybe you can help me with that.
are you spoken for, Charlie?
I am. I am. I'm dating a very beautiful woman.
and I hope she's watching right now.
because she really is an incredible inspiration to me.
okay, Amita, there's a lamppost, if you can see, right up ahead on your right.
I want you to just casually stop there.
don't look at the cameras. Megan?
clear in all directions.
nothing suspicious, Don.
okay, go ahead and answer the phone.
we'll hear everything through your Bluetooth.
get a trace going.
take it easy. Just answer it.
spectre Go through the tunnel.
no, meet me by the water.
feisty, and as pretty as your picture. I like the way those jeans fit you.
okay, great, so you can see me.
and I see you're not moving.
okay, who's got a visual? Anyone got a visual for me?
negative.
all right, north side of the park, guys.
everyone take it easy. Amita, I want you to turn around.
and just. just head right into that tunnel.
thanks for coming down, man.
all right, that went pretty well I thought. -Yeah, Charlie.
I screwed up a little bit, Charlie. but she-she was very nice.
we-we need to talk to you.
what's up? -It's about Amita.
is she all right? What's going on?
she's, um, she's fine, she's with Don.
look, she's gone to meet Spectre.
where is she right now?
we can't interfere, it would be too dangerous.
where is she right now, Larry?
I have a proposal that will change your life.
Yeah, let's hear it.
I need a partner to realize a vision unparalled in contemporary gaming.
a paradigm shift.
now go toward that building at the back of the park.
all right, listen up, everybody. It's the old Community Center at the northeast corner.
we had a chance with Primacy, but binko-assbite cashed in.
you work at Wolftrax Games.
not anymore.
you're a smart girl, read the signs from here.
Oh, come on, just talk to me.
great reward requires great risk.
Kali faces fear, how about Amita?
all right, Amita, don't go in that building until I tell you, now.
all right, sweetheart. Do not go into that building until I tell you.
Megan, you're in the front. Colby, you stay with her.
consider an emergent game economy built around an abstract combinatorial system, played across worldwide media, embedded virally into Web sites, TV, text messages, billboards, even radio, beyond the control of corporations.
Yeah, but for what purpose?
step through the door.
chain Factor.
what does that mean?
what's up with the trace?
he's inside the building.
guys, he's inside the building, all right. He's inside the building.
Colby, you stay with her.
you got it, Don.
Megan? -We're in the building, Don.
Amita, go ahead.
don't worry. Don't worry. Just go ahead in.
Colby, stay right with her.
all right, I'm going.
ready to make a deal?
what's Chain Factor?
the game I'll launch with the million dollars.
but I have the Primal Key location.
want to join my alliance?
I get it.
you're playing with emergence where the game takes on a life of its own.
right?
Yeah, it's all real life and death now.
Freeze!
let her go!
you gotta let her go.
let her go!
you cheated!
get down!
Hey! You okay? You all right?
I got you. I got you. I got you.
let me see. You okay?
what are you thinking?
I know, I know, I'm sorry. -How could you.
it wasn't his fault, okay. It was my decision.
you all right?
I'm fine.
come here. -I'm okay.
so Gary Meyers worked at Wolftrax?
Yeah.
he was fired a few months ago.
you know, I actually liked his ideas about an emergent game economy.
are you serious? His obsession with control is the opposite of emergence.
you know, emergence requires allowing natural and unexpected changes to. to emerge.
you know, uh, speaking of emergence.
how are we gonna let our little economy emerge to the next phase, Dr. Eppes?
I've been thinking about that.
I've been giving it some thought.
and I thought I could sell the house back to my Dad, and we could just get our own place.
or, uh, we can get an apartment, and you keep the house as an investment, and Alan could stay put.
or option three, my favorite option, is my Dad buys the condo, he's been talking about forever, and we live in the house together.
I mean, we could all three live in the house together.
though.
let's just take the advice of that popular new author Charlie Eppes in his sizzling, scorching hot new book.
and apply game theory to our problem.
think of the possibilities, assign values, then prioritize.
Hi. -Hey.
how's it going?
uh, Larry's donating all his books to the library.
are you? Well, that means you've reentered your office, I guess.
you know, Larry, you don't have to carry them by hand.
the library will come pick them up.
actually, I do.
I'm taking my office apart, object by object, releasing all attachments to my former self.
so you're going through each and every book to say good-bye?
it's true.
by the way, Larry, you do realize that by emptying your office, you're simply, uh, making it possible to collect more things.
well, if the cycle repeats, perhaps I'll start collecting with consciousness.
okay.
well, I think I see a condo in my future.
not necessarily.
no, we have a plan.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.
you could move in with me, but I don't live anywhere.
it's a party, not a funeral.
uh, it was my mom'S.
God, you can be such a bitch sometimes.
Eppes.
all right, all right, all right, I'm on my way.
did you recognize any of them, miss simms?
it all happened so fast, I didn't even see them.
what about before? Did you see anyone hanging around, watching ella?
everyone. I mean, she's ella.
right. Thanks very much.
straight-up grab?
Yeah, with flash grenades and automatic weapons, and they were professional enough not to hurt anyone.
well, a lot of witnesses.
and not a good one in the bunch.
it's not any ordinary club kid. It's ella pierce.
what, that rich kid? The party girl?
someone's been trolling internet fan sites.
her father is warren pierce. He's worth, like,$2 billion.
he's got textile factories in every country in the world without a minimum wage.
he been notified?
I talked to him on his plane en route to aspen. He's on his way back.
how you doing? Jeff upchurch.
Hi, there. -Critical incident response.
don eppes.
I was on my way to guadalajara, and they rerouted me.
I'm guessing I was the nearest specialist in the area, so. .
specialist in what?
you guys do, what, ten, 15 kidnappings a year?
mexico city, I do 15 a month.
work kidnappings europe, asia, afghanistan.
it's always different, always the same.
so, what's different about this one?
I don't know yet.
but the big money snatches tend to put you in contact with a higher class of lowlife.
if they know their business, and I'm certainly guessing they do, we're looking at simultaneous movement, expected payouts, bargaining strategies. Lot of variables here.
you guys talking about imperfect information games?
checking in. .
you must be professor eppes. -Hi.
bureau gave me a copy of the action report from the che lobo kidnapping last year.
got to tell you, I'm very impressed with the maze math.
Thanks. -Could use some similar inspiration here.
sounds like you might have already started. You were just talking about game theory?
I was. Assuming that our kidnappers are experienced, or they have benefited from the experience of other kidnappers, we can use an optimization method here called a tabu search, which is basically a way of excluding bad data.
places where the kidnappers won't go to isolate where they will go.
I guess that's why they call it tabu, right?
these kidnappers-- they're like a group of hikers.
but they've mapped out a very specific route.
that route is complicated by the terrain, by the density of foliage, by dangerous animals, by water barriers.
they deal with these obstacles using their experience, using the accuracy of their maps, their needs.
and a tabu search can pinpoint the optimal route that the hikers can then choose.
now, assuming that opps' goal is the safe collection of a ransom,
I can interpret their methodology; I can predict their actions.
okay. How soon?
not a lot of information here, you know?
my projections are going to be fairly general.
but as always, the more data that comes in, the more helpful I can be.
Yeah. Eppes.
key's still in the ignition.
I got something.
check this out.
play ME
warren pierce is a criminal, a ruthless parasite who lives off the backs of the workers he exploits.
his debt to society has come due, and if he doesn't pay it. .
the people's nationalist agenda will take it in the blood of his daughter.
we'll contact Mr. Pierce with our demands at noon today.
Kgagenda, aka the pna.
anti-corporate, anti-free trade.
Anti-warren pierce.
the guy who runs the web site-- he calls himself santee, but the bureau's counterterrorism unit-- they don't have a face to go with that name.
they don't even think it's one person.
thing is, we don't even have any identifiable members.
I mean, the banners go up at antiglobalization protests, somebody spray-paints "pna" at a vandalized construction site, but there doesn't seem to be any real, centralized organization.
all right, so maybe they're just messing with us, you know? Maybe they're just hiding behind these guys.
okay, so the van used in the abduction was registered to a diamond lane rentals, reported stolen last week.
start with anyone who'd know the girl's schedule, right?
that's got to be half of los angeles.
Yeah, the good-looking half.
these celebrity socialites-- they live electronically, so,
I'll go deep on the e-mails, text messages, phone logs, the works.
Yeah, good.
so what happened last night?
I don't know. You know, it was late, and I took the call. I thought I'd let you sleep.
that's it?
that's all you're going to give me?
that's all there is.
look, don, we both know things haven't been clicking since leah was killed.
I think you just wanted me out of your face for a few hours, right?
I don't know. Look, even if that's true, is it that big a deal?
it's something to talk about, yeah.
well, I mean, I'm in the middle of a kidnapping here. Come on.
all right. You know, I'll just wait for a bank robbery.
ever since ella became a media darling, a power partier,
I've been waiting for something like this to happen.
and you never saw to it that she got any security?
she turned down bodyguards.
said any kidnapper would pay to give her back after two days.
and with the joke, you let the issue drop?
that's not at all what I meant.
anything ella ever asked for, ever needed, I've always given her gladly.
what you need to understand, mr. Pierce, is that ransom is enough business to make a fellow like yourself confused.
Meaning?
kidnappers will position. They will establish bargaining power.
gentleman such as yourself that's used to calling the shots, used to winning.
you're asking me to be humble.
I'm asking you to be smart.
okay, this is what we talked about. Want to stay calm, engaged.
keep them on the phone as long as possible. Is everybody ready?
whenever you are, sir.
hello.
if this isn't warren pierce, ella pierce is as good as dead.
who are you?
don't ask who I am. Ask how much I want.
I need to know my daughter is all right.
dad? Daddy?
demand 1: Shut down all of your company's sweatshops operating in the third world.
if it's me you want.
demand 2: $40 million in rtititueson paid to the thousands of men, women and children your company has exploited in the third world.
I'll give you $10 million.
in a secured swiss account.
this guy's using a sat phone. He's bouncing the signal.
what the hell was that?
a counteroffer.
you're lowballing on your daughter's life?
I talked to him in a language he understands.
do you understand that they hung up on you?
that you put your daughter's life in more danger?
he'll call back.
and now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make arrangements for payment.
guys like that-- it's all about money and power.
actually, that was the right call, straight out of the playbook.
he pays too much, too fast, too soon, pna's going to figure they didn't ask enough.
they're going to come back looking for more.
you really think he could be operating out of your playbook?
you got a different theory?
that his daughter's just another negotiable asset.
you get this out of your favorite head shop?
no, charles. This cannot be purchased in any shop.
I've constructed my own hero's fountain.
named after hero of alexandria, the greek mathematician and engineer.
you see, once the pressure is right, the water will flow under its own power.
and how is this part of your achieving zen, larry?
einstein said religion should arise from the experience of all things natural and spiritual in a meaningful unity.
now, made from the parcels of my former self, this fountain perfectly analogizes the seamless integration of both my physical and spiritual lives.
shouldn't you be at the fbi? The kidnapping is all over the news.
Oh. Yeah. The ransom negotiation cut short, so I may need to rethink my tabu search.
maybe weight the data with a bayesian prior.
while I condone none of the major felonies, do have to say, kidnapping-- that does hold a certain.
conceptual intrigue, this business of affixing value to a human life.
Oh, I think it's almost there.
observe, charles: Water rising to a new level, as is my own hope.
I'm out of here.
it dawned on me while I was looking at larry's zen rock garden.
what? Larry has a zen rock garden?
Yeah, actually, it was his hero fountain that got me going, but it's an even longer story.
let's reconsider my hiker analogy, all right?
and think of a mudslide falling in front of the hikers.
it changes terrain, it changes their direction.
right, okay.
so my tabu search accounted for the kidnappers following a planned path, but with pierce's counteroffer, they've had to break off contact.
they've essentially been detoured.
they have to find a new way to get to their waterfall.
we're expecting them to make another ransom-oriented decision, to hike around the mudslide, right?
but I-I think they're going to abandon that path completely.
I think they're going to find another way.
everyone down on the ground!
open the safe.
so what do you think, kill the pierce girl and go underground?
Oh, that would be giving up.
essentially turning around.
I based my analysis on the information the pna put up on their web site:
their stated goals, their state of mind.
I think they're going to going to bulldoze through this mudslide.
I think they're going going to do something sudden, something violent, something completely unexpteecd.
all right, so the safe holds cash deliveries from payroll trucks and they drop off two to $300, 000 a day.
but these geniuses hit two hours after the money went to the bank.
so they got six, maybe seven grand in petty cash.
not the hit they were hoping for.
their movements are really synchronized;
it suggests a high degree of discipline, a high degree of conviction.
let's not dance around it. What are we thinking here?
judging by the way she's balancing that rifle, my money says it isn't even loaded.
that girl could be holding a gun behind her back.
I mean, look at this face.
that is the face of a scared little girl.
so they lose the ransom, they hit pierce's business, but I don't get why drag the girl along?
puts her in the line of fire.
human shield, maybe it's their counteroffer to pierce.
they placed her in deliberate frame of that security camera.
they want us to see her face. They're asserting dominance.
I think they just want to eolatvi pierce and show him that they control his destiny.
that looks like an alpha to me.
think he's our mythical santee?
Warner.
what?
Pierce just e-mailed the pna's web site and told them he isn't paying.
I've dealt with rogue governments, guerilla fighters, organized crime.
they all understand the rules of negotiation.
if these animals aren't going to speak to me in a language I can understand. .
well, that's why I'm here, sir. To help translate.
look, we both know that if I cave in, they're going to bleed me dry.
and I still won't get ella back.
that's always possible.
so what was my choice?
well, you had a couple of options, sir, the worst of which was negotiate with the pna without talking to me first.
so you think I should back down?
tell them I'll pay.
no, you change your direction too quick, it's just going to confuse them.
we definitely don't want these guys panicking.
the next move is theirs.
let's just hope it's not killing your daughter.
you don't have much of a bedside manner.
must be why I don't get invited to many parties.
still trying to break into ella pierce's e-mail account. It turns out it's encrypted.
it's locked with a software tool used primarily by it programmers at major corporations.
that's funny, huh? I mean, why would she be doing that?
if you don't, that stuff will turn up on some online celebrity gossip site.
you know the whole world knows your business.
let me ask you something. I mean, not about this.
about liz?
Yeah, how'd you know?
you asked permission to ask.
Hey, I got to end it.
I mean, it's just way too complicated with work.
the thing is, every time I do, we end up in bed.
Hey, man, you guys work funky hours, long stakeouts, you're dodging bullets together.
it sounds like adrenaline.
I mean, adrenaline is great, but, you know, I don't know if that's a real relationship.
I'm sorry, you wanted to ask me a question.
I think you just answered it.
so what kind of lizard decides that his daughter isn't worth a fraction of his bank account?
loathe as I am to contradict you, the decision is so entirely out of character.
it suggests true emotional anguish.
Larry, what the hell would you know about his character?
I think what he's simply pointing out is that pierce has violated his own corporate game theory.
it's standard minimax.
it's a tug of war, a demonstration of brute strength between two opposing sides where one side can pull the other side across a center line.
however, after the competition started, one team can embarrass the other by letting go of the rope.
that team humiliates its opponent, but they've lost.
so essentially, pierce has let go of his rope.
he's struck back in the way least likely to achieve a positive result.
which runs counter to the instincts responsible for his corporate success, ergo my observation that his judgment is clouded by a high state of distress.
Yeah, but, larry, I went through ella's things, and I found letters from her father, throughout her childhood that were typed.
they were dictated to a secretary.
I know, because his secretary's name is cc'd on them.
what kind of father would do that?
so you two just stick to the blackboard and I'll take care of the profiling.
I expect that from my brother.
any idea what's going on there?
Yeah, some.
so pna put this up ten minutes ago.
the people's nationalist agenda is not to be taken lightly.
their recent action towards my father's corrupt business interests are just a taste of what's to come until he responds to the pna's demands.
close the sweatshops.
pay the ransom.
sent directly to the national news outlets as well.
it'll be all over tv tonight.
so what, he piss on them, they piss on him?
all right, meanwhile, we've made some headway on your alpha.
he's looking more and more like our "santee.
facial recognition software connected him to several antiglobalization protests and then a gun store robbery in seattle, two months ago.
similar mo.
all the same characters.
my guess is that this is where they decided to graduate from tree hugging and disorderly conduct to heavy felonies.
the problem is that santee managed to keep his nose clean, at least on paper.
there's no rap sheet, no id.
20s, wanted, off the grid.
listen, um. .
I know this isn't the right time to talk.
but I just want to make sure we make the time.
I think so, too. I mean, uh. .
we will.
okay.
it's an mpeg file, and from its resolution, I think it came from a sat phone.
Ayok, how does that help us?
I mean, if we had a dtmf decoder. .
it's a dual-tone multi-frequency. It's touchtone.
you couldn't have just said that to begin with?
Yeah, but it wouldn't have been as much fun.
the decoder works kind of like a prism.
instead of refracting light into its individual frequencies, its component colors, the decoder separates the phone signal into different tones and numeric values.
from which we can then decipher the actual phone number.
okay, where can we get one of these things?
if the kidnappers are using a land line or a cell phone, you can buy a dtmf decoder from a consumer electronics store.
right, but they're using a sat phone, so. .
hacking a satellite signal requires a little more sophistication, but I can put a unit together.
I mean, I built my first computer when I was 13.
I know my way around a circuit board.
and, you know, the electrical engineering department has all the parts I need.
all right, so if they're using a satellite phone, this thing is going to tell us where they were, not where they are now, right?
Yeah, that's why I've been patiently waiting here.
I think the additional information has helped my tabu search, and I think I have an idea where the pna might show up next.
as far as hunches go, I certainly played worse.
they appear where he works, so his neighborhood could be next.
when it comes from charlie, it's kind of a hunch-plus.
so I've heard.
also heard some stuff about you.
Yeah, like what?
you like to run with the tactical boys.
the first through the door, that sort of thing.
cowboy enough to get your name out there, but not unsafe.
I just had a few things on my mind, man.
kicking in doors and dodging bullets?
that's my kind of therapy.
I came up through special forces.
nearly bounced off the walls in that damn field office.
you ever consider going for the adrenaline fix full-time?
you get to travel, leave the paperwork to guys like. .
well, you.
man: Reportsif a olent alarm at 7626 east ellendale.
Ellendale, that's two blocks from here.
it's also harper simms' address. That's ella pierce's friend.
FBI! Nobody moves!
let me see your hands!
you in the car! Up! Let me see them hands!
back off!
it's never gonna happen.
what the hell just happened here?
looks like our rescue mission just turned into a manhunt.
l us what you saw.
they were waving guns around.
I thoughtI was going to die.
and ella?
was showing them where everything was:
the cash, my mom's jewelry, the safe.
she was acting like the brat that she is, except with a gun.
and that loser steffen, calling himself santee now...
you, uh, you recognized santee?
Yes. Steffen cavani-- the stoner we went to high school with.
come on! She's totally with him.
yes and no.
how no?
she's young and she's vulnerable, and she hasn't had any contact with anyone outside of her captors.
what, like, brainwashing?
she would not be the first person to identify with her victimizers and then act accordingly.
she's with them a day and a half.
you have no idea how quickly someone's will can be broken.
Mr. Pierce.
you have my full cooperation. -Thank you.
the sooner ella's apprehended, the sooner my legal team can prepare her defense.
there's no "there must be some kind of mistake," or "my daughter'sno t capable of that?
do you have children? -Do you?
I did some background.
after your wife died, your daughter came into a large inheritance and sued for emancipation.
Ella went through a great deal after her mother's death, and she lashed out at me.
Yeah, and you lashed back with a team full of lawyers and put her back inside her glass jar.
she was a 16-year-old girl, emotionally overwrought, and I was not going to let her ruin her life.
no, you were just going to hold her hostage instead.
it is a small wonder she is identifying with her kidnappers.
it's probably the only love she's ever know.
all right, all right.
how goes the decoder?
who knew tracing a phone call could do so much damage to a manicure?
what?
is it wrong to get turned on at the sight of you in goggles and rubber gloves?
Oh, damn it.
are you all right? -Yeah.
that's the third circuit I've blown today.
I've got a spare in my office. I'll be back.
excuse me, professor.
Oh, hey.
is that a decoder? -Yeah, this is it.
not exactly what I imagined after reading some of your more ethereal musings on cake-cutting theory, I've got to tell you.
well, sometimes cake is a series of algorithms that help formulate an analysis.
and other times, cake is just cake.
listen, I wanted to spitball something at you about that tabu search.
it's funny you mention that because I've been giving it some thought.
it's quite possible that the pna's tactical shift might actually help us.
hitting the house makes no tactical sense whatsoever. -I agree.
it's like your hikers just. .
it's like they decided to chase after a butterfly.
you know what? That's a great analogy.
because once the hikers veer off, chasing after that butterfly, they reveal the butterfly's path with the evidence that they leave in their wake
with footprints and with broken branches.
that evidence allows me to analyze their tactics using decision analysis.
figure out which butterfly they're chasing.
he went to high school with ella pierce and harper simms.
gets expelled from berkeley after a semester for disruptive behavior, then falls straight off the grid.
the techs finally cracked ella pierce's e-mail account.
turns out her and cavani have been going back and forth for nearly a year.
you have to listen to this stuff.
can't believe you're the same guy in moscowitz' history class.
if I'd known the real you, I would've jumped you a long time ago.
lots more where that came from, all in the same vein.
all right, so, what, she hooks up with the loser guy and hides it from harper.
he starts working on her poor little rich girl complex, makes her feel guilty about daddy's sweatshops.
sounds like megan's department.
Yeah, well, megan's on a little bit of a time out, so. .
again?
what about the dead shooter?
Reggie woods, 25.
string of arrests for disorderly conduct, mostly related to antiglobalization rallies in seattle.
Reggie was busted in glendale 2006 for defacing a police car.
his partner in crime was lucas cavani, who purely coincidentally happens to be steffen's cousin.
we've got a call into his parole officer.
delivery van.
you still purging the office?
I'm trying to find suitable homes for the material shards of my past that no longer inform my present.
now, it seemed to me you an affection respighi's ancient airs and dances.
Oh, thank you.
still no respite from the case?
Oh, ella pierce was kicked out of boarding schools from new york to lausanne.
I got duis, stint in rehab.
it's like a textbook example of trying to draw love from her father through negative attention.
unless I'm just seeing too much of myself in the case.
as your friend, I would not presume to speculate, particularly given our last exchange on the matter.
Oh, larry, I'M. .
I'm really sorry about that. I had no right to snap at you.
I mean, maybe you could just not be my friend for a minute and tell me the truth.
you know, I've always been cautious in addressing the issues you have with your father.
well, I know there's profound pain there.
but having said that, it is surprising to me that humanity was able to arrive so quickly at a correct model of the solar system.
there's this driving tendency to orient the universe in rotation around. .
well, our own little world.
thanks for the respighi.
Lucas, fbi! Open up!
Yeah, nice try, frank. I'll have your rent tomorrow.
get up against the wall! I want to see your hands!
against the wall! -I didn't do anything.
Reggie woods is dead.
what?
he made a mistake of pointing a gun in my general direction.
your cousin happened to be standing right next to him.
steffen? -Yeah.
Oh, man, that idiot.
he hasn't been right since he got involved with that bitch.
Yeah, I guess you never get over the one who wouldn't talk to you in high school.
I'm all for fighngti the power, but she talked scary way above my tolerance.
that's why I got some distance.
you can check, whatever you want to check. I don't run with those guys anymore.
Yeah, so where do they run?
Reggie told me they had a squat in east la, near the freeway.
that was a few months ago, though.
while you're out there fighting the power, try recycling.
something larry said got me thinking about a misspent youth.
you and larry warming up again?
I think we're making our way off the back burner.
how are you and don? How's that been going?
trying not to get burned.
it's a challenge.
I think you should get hazard pay for even trying.
speaking of, I got a seduction going on here in these e-mails, only ella seems to be the aggressor.
she flatters santee, she speaks to his political convictions, he mostly agrees with her.
he begs her for sex.
certain words jumped out.
how the hell would he even get near a girl like this?
she's famous, she's insulated by money and privilege, and he barely registers outside of the website.
it's a lot easier for the "it" girl to reach out to the class burnout.
which is also the perfect instrument to lash out at her father.
Oh, god.
Ella must have planned this whole thing.
so I used decision analysis to reset the parameters of my predictive model.
I factored in the impulse motive of the pna.
find our butterfly?
Yeah, my analysis keeps pointing back to warren pierce.
so why did they hit harper simms' house?
it seems to predicate on opportunity and familiarity.
look, they're attacking locations that ella pierce can facilitate.
so what's the next inside job?
I can answer that.
intel says this posted in the last ten minutes.
I have seen the harm and wrong my business practices have caused to the great working peoples of the world.
I call on my board of directors to immediately dismantle my factories, for my bank to dissolve all of my assets immediately.
warren pierce industries has 24 hours to show us their sincerity.
in the great struggle for world justice, my father will no longer receive preferential treatment.
to divest all interests in asia and latin america and donate the proceeds to relief agencies.
as of tomorrow, warren pierce industries will cease to exist.
I don't understand. I thought we had eyes on the guy.
we did, but we pulled them all when this stopped being a kidnapping.
and he has his own security.
well, where were they?
he's buying time. The board will never go along with dissolving his company.
Yeah, but he's out of time.
his refusal to pay the ransom pushed her over the edge.
daddy didny pla'twith her her whole life.
if he doesn't play with her now. .
there's only one way this is going to end up for pierce.
how's it going, guys?
good, good. We're almost there.
we've intercepted the pna's upload of pierce's communique to their website, and she's running it through the decoder.
I isolated the cdma code, and separated the information on the mpeg.
and this is gonna lead us to where the signal was transmitted from, right?
provided we don't blow another circuit.
okay, I got a lock on the phone number. .
north 34 degrees, 38 minutes, west 118 degrees, 14 minutes.
that's east L. A. Cavani said they were squatting near the freeway.
Ah, there it is.
knocking on the door from 300 miles above earth.
we're about to knock a lot harder.
David, talk to me-- you got a visual?
I have pierce.
confirming five bad guys: Three men, two women, including ella pierce.
locked and loaded-- we're in position.
I've got the web cam set up, and I'm hacking into the pna web site.
all right, good.
now, listen, megan, you know, if this girl is in your head. .
she is-- that's why I'm the best person for the job.
any word? -Nothing.
looks like the old man's been lying to us, trying to save his ass.
time's running out, dude.
Ella, we gotta do something. Show him we're not messing around.
maybe if we start sending him back in pieces.
why are you doing this?
it's what pierces do-- taking control of your life, telling you what to do with your money.
we're in.
steffen cavani, this is agent megan reeves from the fbi.
we have the house surrounded.
take the perimeter!
I got nothing to say.
you're gonna have to let piece go.
why, so you can blow us all away?
so maybe you're not going to spend the rest of your life behind bars.
steffen, I know this whole thing wasn't your idea.
I know ella roped you into it.
what are you talking about?
she's the heiress to a multibillion-dollar empire, steffen.
don't you think she could've jtus written a $40-million check to a relief agency?
do you really think she cares about sweatshops?
they paid for her maserati.
she's trying to divide us.
steffen, the only thing she cares about is hurting her father.
you're just the ride to the prom. She's got other plans for the night.
no more talk!
I think I lost them.
Ella, what are you doing?
all right, we fire over their heads, fire over their heads! I want them walking out of here!
Roger that.
David, talk to me.
no target acquisition, don-- they're too dug in.
not all of 'em.
two boys, two girls left.
Ella! They're going to kill you!
who cares?
you already killed me, just like you killed mom.
she didn't die from the cancer, she just didn't want to live in that house any more!
you know that's not true!
your mother wanted to live!
I promised h erI would take care of you!
by trapping me in your world? -Honey, please!
you turned me into a tabloid princess, a punchline on david letterman, all so you could sell some damn clothes!
well, now you're in my headline. -Please!
if this escalates, we scare them into shooting pierce.
all right, let's go-- tear gas 'em, tear gas 'em!
they're not gonna let us out of here!
do not punk out on me now, steffan.
I have had enough of people making promises they won't keep.
let's go, let's go, let's go.
I got two coming out.
come here! Come here.
all right, we got 'em. We got 'em, we got 'em.
the rest of you inside, you have 15 seconds to come out with your hands up in the air.
it's over.
don't do it, steffan!
I'm bringing out pierce! Don't shoot!
you're not leaving me!
I don't see ella.
shots fired! Shots fired!
David. .
no, there's too much smoke.
in the arm?
what kind of cowboy is that?
not a cowboy.
just a field agent.
don't say anything. Don't say anything, honey.
I have the best lawyers!
I love you, too, dad.
so it got pretty hairy out there today, huh?
Yeah, well. .
loquacious, as always.
you want to order some food?
what are we doing? -Tonight?
look, the last few days, we've tried to talk, and, you know, now I just. .
I feel tired.
I think we just keep coming back out of habit. .
you know?
I don't want to feel like we lead each other on.
I mean, you deserve so much more than that and I just keep screwing these things up.
see you tomorrow, boss.
you managed to bring the monastery with you.
it's calming.
well, feel free to find your center here, anytime you wish.
every time I think I'm over my father or my childhood, I. .
I think I let this case take me for a ride.
struggle is not altogether a bad thing.
the charged particles of the solar wind require heat and combustion to escape the gravitational pull of the sun.
from tumult comes freedom.
you have this great way of making my neuroses sound cosmic.
my center is back east, so I'm gonna go visit my dad.
I already booked the airplane ticket, it's nonrefundable. .
you want to come with me?
Oh, really?
are you serious?
I don't know, it just sort of came out.
I guess not.
this is very odd, because for some time now, my wanderlust has stoked in me this deep inner urge to visit new york.
I would have to talk to brother theo.
while he's in deep meditation, I've been made custodian of his rabbit.
lucky rabbit.
now, the Sklar graphics booth, miles Sklar will be unveiling Ultraworld number one, the world's rarest and most valuable comic book.
I present.
the long lost, and only copy of Ultraworld number one.
it completes the greatest comic book collection in existence.
man: Okay, everybody! On the ground! Now!
open it!
open it! Do it!
okay, okay.
how game theory can be applied to casual relationships.
between friends, what's the strategic goal?
after all, there's no commodity being sought, right?
let's think about this.
even the most causal relationship is built around a very important commodity.
thank you.
information.
when friend shares information, they place a value on our intention not to use it against them.
and we, in turn, are expected to are our information with them.
we can call this symmetrical information, and it's the foundation of partnerships between countries, corporations, lovers and friends.
you are very popular. U have 17 new text messages.
okay, so for next week, chapter 15 of theory of gas and economic behavior by John Von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern.
you're done. Thank you all.
uh, professor Eppe -yeah, hi. -Peter Lange.
Yeah, uh, biochemistry, right?
uh, no, uh, vanity fair. I'm writing a profile on you.
so, um.
have you always taught game theory?
uh, yeah, yes. It's applied mathematics.
I don't always have this many students.
that's due to the popularity of the book.
right. Oh, I'm also gonna have to talk to friends and your family members.
Really?
well, because your book, the attraction equation, is on the bestseller lists, you're seen as, you know, a friend expert, a kind of, uh.
relationship guru.
so I want to know about your own relationships.
private security guard. Christopher Jenssen.
off-duty cop?
high school football coach wife says he moonlights to make extra money.
has four kids, one starts college next year.
robber shot Jenssen, then he find into the crowd and hit one.
this is all for a mic book?
worth lots of money.
this Sklar has one of the biggest comic collections in the world.
including the ashcan edition of Ultraworld nuer one.
what's the what?
ashcan edition of a comic, it's when a publisher, he only prints one cy, never intended for sale.
often times, it was thrown in the ashcan.
this one in particular, the one that was stolen, was drawn in962 by Ross Moore.
he's a visionary. He's a legendary artist.
how do you know all this?
I started my first collection when I was nE. I still have a few thousand.
a comic book geek in the FBI. Sweet.
Oh, man.
absolute pleasure to meet you, man. I'm a big fan of your work.
I have a first edition of Nanopunk. Mint.
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm a big fan of your work, too.
bank robberies and stuff.
don, this Seth Marlowe. He's an incredible artist, and he's also an expert in comic history.
you know this guy miles Sklar?
Oh, yeah, ye. He is, uh, everything that's wrong with the comic book industry.
how's that?
he started out as a promising young artist, but he said that there wasn't enough money in comic books, and so he created a character that he would sell to tv and, uh, the toy companies, and he made millions.
what would you say this? What is it?
Ultraworld number one.
what's that worth?
uh, maybe $2 million.
if it's actually authentic.
he never had it authenticated?
so, what, you're saying it could be fake?
Yeah. If it's real, it belongs to the guy who created it, Ross Moore.
he's A. a legend in this business.
Ross Moore, that hack?
Yeah, he wrote it decades ago.
look, he sold it, he lost it, whatever.
I paid for it, so it's mine.
he can't come back now asking for it because it's valuable.
how did you get it?
I found it.
it was at an estate sale in Syracuse, New York.
it was in a box with 300 other comics.
and you got it for an investment?
Yes, I will sell it when it's at its peak value, which should be right after Moore dies.
he's not doing very well, so that shouldn't be very long.
nice for you, I guess.
comics are a business.
I'm rich because I understand that.
and this was the first time it was shown?
Yes. I usually keep it in an undisclosed location in a locked safe.
I only brought it to the convention because there were these rumors that it's fake.
in retrospect, a bad idea.
talk about arrested development.
you can't deny the cultural impact that comic have had on this country.
you got Lichtenstein, Warhol.
hugh Jackman in a wolverine outfit. That as hot.
agent Sinclair!
there's a wild rumor that Ultraworld just sold on the black market for, 000 bucks.
what? Who bought it?
who says they bought it? That's impossible.
how would you know? -Because I know.
Hey, sir? FBI.
we need to speak to you for a second.
uh, I don't know anything.
he didn't ask you anything yet.
three guys are fighting over there. They all say they bought Ultraworld.
no way! I. -you what?
let me see your hands.
Oh, god.
there's copies everywhere.
so much for our rare one-of-kind comic.
so people bought a stolen comic, even though a man died.
that's just obsessive collecting.
three hours after the robbery, buyers got an e-mail from someone claiming to have acquired the actual comic from the robbers.
hey there.
you with us?
Yeah. At?
I mean.
how did the buys go down it was cash only, ranging from five to 40, 000 dollars.
the seller met with buyers over a six hour period each at a different public place.
general description is a white guy, mid-20s.
MEGAN: Is there a chance that the real one was sold along with the fakes?
tech said all the copies are of similar quality, all done in old paper.
but because Sklar never had his authenticated, there's no way of knowing if it's the real Ultraworld number one.
well, someone thought it was worth killing for.
MEGAN: You know, that shooter reacted to minor resistance with rage.
maybe there's an aggression disorder.
there'd probably be a violent record.
Yeah, and check it out. Those locations are pretty evenly spaced, huh?
know what that means.
somebody tried to make them look random, but they're not.
Yeah, why don't you run it by Charlie? -All right.
you doing okay?
Yeah.
so the fakes were sold at 14 locations within a five-mile radius.
well, that's excellent, because I can get you a probable base for the seller.
all right, how about the copies themselves?
dude, I love forgery problems, because I can compare the copies, see if they're drawn by the same person.
I just wish I knew more about comic books.
well, you've come to the right place.
Hey, you're the, uh, FBI math guy yeah, yeah, that's me.
I've been getting a lot of press.
I'm Charles Eppes. -Seth Marlowe.
all right, Seth. And I guess you're an expert on comic collecting and history.
and I see that you're an artist yourself.
Yeah, these are my people.
all right.
what do you want to know?
what makes a comic valuable?
rarity, age and condition.
which is why a lot of collectors don't even read them.
they just buy them and seal them up.
the book's condition. This one's mint, perfect.
never been read.
and now it never will be.
it's only good for showing off.
and, uh, what does this.
this yellow sticker mean?
that it's been doctored.
cuts the value.
people paint faded copies, spray them with cooking oil to make them shiny, use tape on smudges, which takes off some of the original ink.
how about forgery, is that common?
if you're good enough to fake a comic, you're good enough to be drawing your own.
Charlie: Highly rare comic valuable, that'd be motivation for forgery?
rare ones are well-known to collectors.
all right, so all I'll need is copies of Ross Moore's work drawn around the same time that he drew Ultraworld number one.
you know Ross Moore?
he's a friend.
I'll talk to him.
moore: That's the old stuff you want. That's from 1962.
two eks after I drew Ultraworld one.
it's exactly what we need. Thank u so much.
how are you feeling today, Ross?
all right, as long as I don't try to do anything too fast.
I got emphysema, kidney problem.
beat the big "c" a couple years ago.
Mr. Moore, it's a real honor.
I've always loved your books. I own a lot of them.
probably more than I do.
I sold most of my collection, years ago.
Hey, you had no way of knowing how crazy the Mark was going to get.
threw old books out. Gave them away.
we left behind boxes of stuff when we moved offices.
I didn't mean to lose Ultraworld, t somewhere back then, it got misplaced.
I'd sure like to have it back.
why that one?
well.
supported me when i was getting started, stuck with me all this time.
with my health problems, we're pretty broke.
but after I'm gone, she could sell it, live well the rest of her life.
and that'll happen.
if there's any justice in this world.
justice?
kid, you read too many comic books.
Charlie's sending over a hot zone map so we can target the seller's locations.
that great.
you asked for these files from Karen Silver in the art crime unit?
um, yeah, it's record some stuff on known forgers in the area.
he what do you know about Karen? Does she,
she got a boyfriend? What's her story?
she's married. -Oh, really?
Why? You looking to meet someone?
you know, it's just back in Idaho it was pretty easy to meet girls.
knew just about everybody who lived in the town where I grew up.
I know some pretty interesting women.
hmm, I'm sure you do.
smart, successful, great sense of humor, but you leave out "big-boned, owns 17 cats.
I will bet you 20 bucks I can set you up with someone and you'll like it.
20 bucks? All right, you're on.
you know what I really liked?
I loved those fabulous funny freak brothers or anything R. Crumb or Harvey Pekar.
yeah? Me, no, I wanted adventure.
the quest for cosmic answers.
Oh, you were into superheroes.
well, daredevil, fantastic four.
of course, my favorite was Galactus.
that's the guy who ate planets.
Yeah, well, he was stellar darwinism. Was necessary to the survival of the universe.
Yeah, he was the third force along with eternity and death.
Larry, he wanted to eat the earth.
but he didn't.
Hey, David, I found a printing house that deals in vintage paper.
they had a request for '50s-era pulp paper.
that's what the forgeries are printed on.
Yeah, and the guy used a fake name and paid cash, but I got a description, and he was wearing a dr. Strange t-shirt.
by the hoary hosts of Hoggoth!
what?
uh, dr Strange's catchphrase. You know, when he'd use. yeah.
Charlie's map shows an area that's central to all the forry sales.
all right, we can run down records of all the male residents in the area.
might not need to.
I checked out the businesses in the hot zone.
there's a comic book store right there.
so I called to see if there was any unusual activity recently.
like the w you're thinking.
day after the robbery, a guy walked in, he bought $20, 000-worth of collectible comic books.
he was wring a dr. Strange t-shirt.
same as the guy who bought the vintage-era paper.
Yep. He might be trying to launder the money from the forgery sales.
this guy a regular customer? The kind they might know by name?
he's the kind that puts in in an order for more books.
you're kidding me. So they not only know his name.
they have his home phone number.
I think I hear water running.
man: Gentlemen, I'm in the shower!
he's going t the back.
Oh, man who's gonna tackle this guy?
whoever gets there last.
Hey, give me the keys to your car now!
ladies, ladies, FBI! Please, let him go, okay?
please, let him. Thank you.
your dropped your cape.
so we know you bought vintage paper.
same paper you used to make the forgeries of underworld #1.
it's not a crime to buy pap.
you don't have anything else.
how about indecent exposure?
what?
naked car grabing.
the worst kind.
mark Vaughn, gentlemen, classic con personality, goes along with the mail fraud and the scams.
yeah? You think robbery?
Yes, but he's not our shooter.
he knows how to control his emotions.
he's not our forger. He's got no background in art.
I'm kinda thinking he might be on a team, maybe two other people.
right, maybe one's an aist. -and the other's the killer.
Yeah, so we run down his associates, look for the trigger-happy psycho?
Yeah, that sounds good. Thanks, guys.
anybody else think don's been a little off these days?
kinda hard to say, but maybe a little.
especially since he broke up with Liz.
maybe one of us should go and see if he wants to talk about it.
you volunteering? -Hell, no.
I'd spent my entire life with comic-book art, especially Ross Moore's and I can't tell if this is real or not.
well, that's 'cause what is you look at the style, the form of drawing techniques.
silly me. What do you do?
fractal number estimate.
it's based on Mandelbrot's use of fractal dimension to measure the jaggedness of a coastline.
so what's going on in here?
Oh, hello. Other than a very hot woman looking very hot?
Charlie, I'm sorry, I've been swept off my feet.
I'm going to have to run off with this man because he is so smooth.
Oh you mock me. Seriously, what are you doing
I am using the fractal-dimension analysis to evaluate the wrinkliness of these lines.
the wrinkliness?
an authentic piece of handwriting or drawing will have a smoother ink edge than one that is forged.
so for instance, en I sign my own name, the pen moves quite rapidly.
the movements of my hand are fast and fluid, thus minimizing the contact between paper and pen.
the faster the hand movement, the smoother the edge of the ink.
however, when someone copies my signature, it's an imitation of my movement.
it's not as natural for the forger, so it's slower.
the slower the pen, the longer the contact with the paper, the more time for ink to be absorbed into the paper which creates an irregular or wrinkly edge.
fractal dimension wsallo us to compare the wrinkliness and detect the fake.
these fractal comparisons are telling us the same thing.
that none of the copies we analyze were drawn by Ross Moore.
yet there are similarities across multiple pots of edge comparison.
which means?
the same artist drew all the forgeries.
and we can try to match the forger's style to a specific comic book artist is you can get us samples of artists that are capable of copying Ross Moore.
he did inspire an entire generation of artists, but, uh, yeah, I-I can help you round up the usual suspects.
great.
this guy you got, Mark Vaughn, he's your basic Grifter.
any real bad guys he knows met courtesy of the state of California.
in prison.
during a stint a couple years ago, he bought protection from Gordon Garrity, 44. A real sweetie.
armed robbery, home invasion, assault with intent, involuntary manslaughter.
I ran a check for you.
he skipped two parole appointments. There's a warrant out.
well, thanks very much. Thanks for running the check.
appreciate it.
this guy is not going to be easy to find.
doesn't sound like it.
but, um, what about her? She your type?
and of course, form flourished all rough the '30s and '40s, particularly during world war ii when people felt so frightened and futureless.
the comic book heroes embodied the he that good would triumph, power was in the hands of the right.
with great power comes great responsibility.
that's right. And the way of the hero is the path of self-sacrifice.
Hey, Seth, you got anything for us?
Yes, sir these are all done by artists who could draw like Ross Moore if the wanted to.
Oh, it's surely not Harry Hoodle.
come on. I've read all his books.
this is all based on drawing sty.
look, man, I'm giving you stuff from some of my best friends here.
I see you bought my book.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
you want to sign it for me? Might be worth something someday.
Yeah. I'll tell you what. I'll sign one of mine if you sign one of yours r me.
how about a Nanopunk? -Cool.
you know that magazine writer called me? Do you think I should talk to him?
uh, both my publisher and my publicist think you should.
Yeah, but do y?
Larry, it was never my intent to go down in history as some crackpot expert.
there's something to be said for being an expert.
so, have you found your systery forger?
no, not yet. There's still a lot of artists to test.
I think you should consider economics.
what was the result of the robbery and the forgeries?
uh, somebody made money on those forgeries and at this point, Sklar's copy has been totally discredited.
so fake books, a real book.
now what does economic theory say about the value of false goods commingled with genuine.
genuine goods lose value, right?
okay, so putting our thinking caps on here, who would want to devalue Ultraworld and Diredit Sklar?
I think I know whose art I need to analyze xt.
Hey, I know who the forger is.
Yeah.
it's Seth Marlowe.
yeah? Can you prove that?
no, but I have a theory.
and it's far too elegant not to be true.
it's elegant because it all fits.
it's not just about theft, it's about making people doubt that Sklar's Ultraworld was real.
well, we know that Seth hates miles Sklar.
right, and if Sklar's was fake, then he can't claim the real one when it shows up, and it will.
you think the real one is in Seth's possession?
he's gonna try and make his ownership look legitimate?
he didn't steal it for himself.
he wants to give it to Ross Moore.
Charlie's telling me his theory on Seth Marlowe. It's "elegant.
Yeah, I know all about it, but he doesn't have any proof. It's a hunch.
you have hunches. You follow them.
yeah well, Charlie, you know, look, we don't exactly think of you as our hch guy.
I had a hunch about the Eppes convergence way before I had the math.
einstein had a "hunch" about relativity decades before it could be proven.
Hey, I don't want to get in the middle of a brother thing here, but, um, -do you want my professional opinion? -Of course.
Seth doesn't fit the profile. He has no criminal record.
he's a rely well-known artist. He's a historian, a collector.
he stands more to lose than he stands to gain.
those are both excellent professional opinions to consider, however once considered.
they don't change my hunch, but thank you.
Hunc gordon garrity, our robber's prison bud.
he's not turning up.
we're going throu his known associates trying to put together a geograical map of his past crimes.
so, what's Charlie got?
elegance, no proof.
excuse me. I'm Peter Lange. -Yes.
I'm writing the piece on Charles Eppes.
I was unaware that vanityair has a mathematics section.
we didn't. Culture, society, media, celebty.
where professor Eppe now finds himself.
around here, he was famous before he wrote the book.
I, uh.
I want to write about.
you and his other friends.
okay, well, he's well-liked on campus. Wherever he goes.
Yeah, I know, he's the most popular professor on campus, but he has few close friends.
a former teacher, a former student.
I think he just chooses to live by Benjamin Franklin's
be civil to all, social with many, and known to few.
a few being. two?
come on. You know, I was a total geek in high school. I know what it's like.
you know, Charlie's passionate about the world, but he thinks about it in terms of numbers and patterns.
how many people can he share that with?
other mathematicians?
Yeah, but few of us arted college at 13.
Charlie wasn't part of a social peer group until he was an adT.
so the fact that he's as compassionate and engaged as any of us.
I mean, think that's his greatest accomplishment.
Hey, Seth, this is Charlie.
Charlie, yeah, we.
we know each other.
he's helping the FBI find Ultraworld.
trying to.
Yeah, you've been great.
so, um.
what brings you here?
I could use a couple more samples of Ross' work I wanted to meet the man everybody's abing talk out.
these kids today they make too much about us old guys.
we were just trying to make a little money, have some fun.
you created a new art form.
what, comic book what's all this?
this guy, always bringing stuff.
Seth, I don't know what iris and I would do without you.
you give us so much of your time.
I know you've got more important things to do.
no, not more important than this.
you guys, we found something on Garrity.
let me guess. He's fan of comic books.
Yeah. How'd you know?
cause I was just telling Don that some of Seth Marlowe's fans live in state prison.
and they write their favorite comic book artist letters.
Yeah, we found the same link.
Garrity wrote a letter a year ago.
sent it from the high desert state prison to Seth Marlowe.
righ well, I'm sure the guy gets a thousand of these a year.
Yeah, but how many of them are from inmates?
and how many are from guys who have a direcconnection to Mark Vaughn?
what do I think of miles Sklar?
I think he got a mega-dose of vitamin K.
K for Karma.
parades around claiming he owns Ultraworld #1
but he never got it authenticated.
I wonder if that's because he knew that it was fake.
not a fake.
I'm an artist, not a forger.
come on, if you were a real artist you would have given the comic back to Moore.
but you were waiting for him to die, ya freakin' vulture.
an artist... like you, the creator of that lame Nanopunk?
Oh, yeah, and your mr. Bobble head is a superhero for the ages.
Hey, I was robbed.
I was robbed and a man died, and it's all a big joke to you.
I don't think it's a joke.
in fact, I have an idea about how some good can come of this.
the final event of this convention is the comic auction.
let's add some items to that list, shall we?
everybody who bought a fake Ultraworld can put it up for sale.
Yeah, I know, they're forgeries, but, hey, come on, they're famous.
and the money that we raise can be split between the buyers that got ripped off, and Ross Moore
I'll buy one myself.
what do I get out of something like that?
Hey, I'm not a bad guy!
I'm a victim!
interesting proposal. An auction.
it wasn't too "we-are-the-world dish"?
no, not at all. It's great.
so what brings you back to the land of the uber nerds
I just came down to let you know that my analysis is close to identifying the forger in this case.
how exacy does a mathematical analysis turn into a criminal conviction?
I mean, you're working with probabilities, right?
it's not like physical evidence.
given the right circumstances, it can lead to that.
Yeah, but, in that case, even if he math does implicate someone, if there's evidence, if there's no.
no link to the crime, you can't prove anything.
Yeah.
I guess you're right.
although if you're not privy to the FBI's case files and you're not part of the actual crime, you can't know that there's no evidence.
Yeah.
I guess I wouldn't know that.
got the ballistics report on the nine millimeter used at the robbery.
stolen from a retired cop's apartment in an assisted-living residence.
how does that help us?
well, it wouldn't if it weren't for this other piece of information here.
Garrity's mom. look where she lives.
Rancho vista assisted-living. Same address.
this guy stole a gun while visiting his other?
maybe he was doing more than just visiting.
Oh, yeah. Violent ex-con who wants to get back into his old ways of doing business.
can't hang out with his former associates.
doesn't want a residence wi his name on the lease.
he can she lives with his mom.
Mrs. Arrity, I'm going to need you to come with us, okay?
what the hell?
it's okay, we're FBI. Will you just comeith us.
a little help, please. -Gordy, it's the damn feds!
lady, stop with the cane.
ma'am, ma'am please, please.
let's do it.
Garrity, freeze!
tell them I'm on the other side of the building.
that's not going to happen.
do it. -No way.
I said do it!
he shot himself. -Yeah, he's dead.
you okay? -Oh, yeah.
David, I found this at the mother's apartment.
Oh, great, let's get it to Charlie.
right. Hey, how you doing?
I'm okay, man. Thanks your asking.
you know, for a minute there, I almost believe a man could fly.
so, I analyzed the copy that you guys found with Gary.
What'd you come up with?
it's not authentic.
it's another forgery.
okay, was it done by whoever made the other forgeries?
Yeah, same artist.
okay, well, assuming it was a copy stolen from Sklar, that means Sklar owned a fake.
no, I just think that's what Seth wants everyone to believe.
so, uh, are you doing a slam job on my son?
no, but I am profiling the man behind a self-help book supposedly based on real science that offers a simplistic fix to difficult issues.
well, let me say this right off, it's not a supposed science.
Yeah, but we're talking about people's emotional lives, we're talking about making money on their desire for easy answers.
there's nothing simplist about Charlie's thinking, I can tell you that.
and he didn't write the book to make money.
then why did he write it?
you mean now or when he was nine?
both.
okay. Charlie was an award kid.
Hebu trusted math.
I mean, he felt safe with math, so,
I guess it was natural to try to use math to help him get along with other kids.
did it work? -Uh, no, not at all.
well, then.
why write the book now?
it's not like it's gonna add to his professional standing, and it could even diminish it.
you know, uh, to be honest, I don't think he really thought that one through. -Really?
he just thought it was an interesting application of game theory, and that everyday people would read it.
so, he wanted to write it for a wider audience.
Chlie thinks math is beautiful.
and he wants everyone to love the way he does.
you found something? -Yeah.
you know, most forgers want their forgeries to fool everybody forever. Right?
not Seth.
Yeah, cause some point, he wants the real copy to be acknowledged.
right, he has to prove that the fakes are fake, so you know what he did?
he marked them.
you found this mark?
only 'cause I went looking for it.
see these lines of varying length? -Yeah.
they are identifiable as a simple representational code.
each length represents a different letter or number.
and look what it spells out.
why would he put Sklar's name on it?
Ah, cause Seth's got a wicked sense of humor.
Charlie, this is really wild stuff, but you understandit really doesn't give us evidence against Seth Rlowe.
that evidence'll come at the auction.
Oh, you think that's how he plans to launder the real copy. Throw it in with the fakes.
a genuine good commingled with false goods.
in auction theory, we talk about equilibria or symmetry.
all the bidders have the exact same information, except Seth knows something the other bidders don't know, which is that the original copy of Ultraworld #1 will be an item up for bid.
so, asymmetrical information creates asymmetrical bidding.
Charlie, this guy, he already knows that we suspect him, right?
so, he's gonna to use a straw man or a proxy to do the bidding for him.
right, and that straw n will be bidding off of Seth's information.
no this asymmetry will almost certainly create a situation called jump bidding, which is when a person enters a far rger bid than necessary to be the current winning bidder.
I don't understand. What's the advantage of that?
it's like a bike race.
typically, there is no advantage to jumping ahead of the pack, so racers tend to stay clustered together and switch off the leads.
but there is a strategy of taking the lead early to exhaust the competition.
jump bidding is like quickening the speed of the race.
it encourages the early exit of some bidders, and discourages the late entry of others.
so, when someone makes a big bid during the auction.
that Seth's straw man.
and you're going to be able to tell the real one?
it's the one without Seth's code drawn into it.
okay.
Hiya, Seth.
professor Eppes.
you come here to catch the evil mastermind?
I'm here to bid on one of the famous forgeries.
who knows?
the real one could be here.
I think they're all fakes, if you ask me.
what, exactly, are you looking for, Charlie?
just looking.
okay, let's t started on this special auction of 14 versions of the famous Ultraworld #1, proceeds to benefit the sellers, and the renowned artist Ross Moore.
not authenticated. Believed to be a forgery.
we'll start the bidding at $500. Do I have $550?
$550! -I have $55
$600.$600. -I have $60
do I hear $650?
I have $650.
50 going once, twice and sold.
moving to item number two. $650 going once, twice and.
this is item number five. Moving to item nber five.
again, we'll start the bidding at $500.
I have $550. I have $700. Do I have $750?
sold.
moving now to item number nine. Sold.
going once, twice and sold.
this is item 11, Ultraworld #1, again unauthenticated, possible forgery.
what do I hear? -$700!
I have $700. Do I have $750?
$750. -Do iave $800?
2000
here we go.
$2, 050. -I have $2, 050.
3000
I have $3, 100 over here.
$4, 000. -I have $4, 000.
5000
5500
$800. -$10, 000.
I have $10, 000. Do I hear $10, 500?
$15, 000. -$20, 000.
$20, 000. Going once, twice, three times, and sold!
U figured it out.
your math stuff worked.
Sklar had the real one, huh?
the authentic copy of Ultraworld #1, and then you stole it.
Ultraworld #1 belongs to Ross Moore.
not to me, and certainly not to miles Sklar.
a man was killed.
unfortunately, nothing can change that.
but ving the comic back to Ross is goi to change a lot.
your fan from prison almost shot my brother Charlie, please. Come on. Please, man.
I know you understand what this is all about.
why I did this. Let me give the comic back to Ross.
it doesn't work like that, Seth.
Charlie. -Okay, Seth, get your hands behind your back.
we're taking you in for me questioning.
Vaughn and Garrity, both fans, read my stuff in persion.
how did you sneak the real copy into the auction?
I'm the Ross Moore expert, right?
everybody let me examine their Ultraworld #1.
I swapped the real one for a fake owned by a guy who promised to ell it in the auction.
what were you going to do with it, genius?
give it to Ross.
and then, in six months or so, d pretend to have found the hidden message with Sklar's name in the forgeries.
well, if it isn't the crime-fighting professor.
come to help me engineer my escape?
no.
Yeah, it was kind of a long shot.
you heard that miles Sklar got the real copy of Ultraworld #1 back?
figured that would happen.
he gave it to Ross Moore.
what? Why?
partly the intense public pressure. I mean, the guy was being vilified.
that never bothered him before.
and, of course, he made a big publicity splash overiving it to Moore, just in time to promote his new comic.
okay, that's. that's the Sklar I know.
still.
he gave it back.
Hey, boys. Good job.
Thanks.
what are you guys doing this weekend? Anyone want to grab a bite or something?
Yeah. Sure. Sounds good.
we haven't done anything outside of work for while, right?
there's life outside of work?
news to me.
Colby granger, someone at my desk for you to meet.
her name's Simone Voray. She's in my Krav Maga class.
she's french. She has a little accent.
and a degree in literature.
she was a star gymnast in college.
now she's an acrobat.
she's a professional acrobat?
Yeah. Cirque du soleil.
ready?
guess it might just be me and you this weekend, huh?
Yeah. Yeah.
it's funny. I remember reading all those comics when I was a kid, but I never saw anyone drawing one.
well, this one should be fun.
reminds me a little of the comics I wrote in the '60S.
I wrote under the name Paisley Mcnasty.
Really?
I have a lite trouble picturing you as a hippie.
what?
right.
you know, Charles, you have a rather distinguished chin there.
he's going to be a superhero, along with his brother.
hold on. Wait a minute. You think someone actually mit publish this?
an FBI agent who solves crimes with the help of his mathematician brother?
it's great!
Aw, nobody would believe it.
Oh, that reminds me. Charlie, look what came in the mail fr that magazine.
that's the proof of the article?
I dot even know why I'm looking at this. This guy was totally out to get me.
no, no, no, no. It's not a hit piece.
sure, he makes some jokes at your expense, but actually, they're quite funny.
his brother don, a special agent "in the los angeles office of the FBI, "believes Charles Eppes has recently conquered "the greatest challenge of friendship.
Charlie and I had our issues growing up.
Yeah, to say the least.
but if ere's anything stronger "than the bond between brothers, "it's the bond between brothers who have become friends.
Chlie's my friend.
I didn't even know the writer wanted to talk with you.
I had to get my name in the magazine somehow, right?
Yeah, yeah. Right.
you can keep your disposable media.
a magazine is old in a week. A comic book.
well, that's forever. -That's right.
well, let's get back in our Charlie's angels pose.
this is more like tango & cash.
Mr. Bell!
I'm from the U. S. Attorney's Office.
they sent me over to make sure you didn't get lost.
after seeing you, getting lost may not be such a bad idea,
I have a car waiting. Fine.
get him off me, man!
I'm not supposed to give my deposition for another hour.
so, if you're hungry, we could...
what... What are you doing?
I don't want to leave any fingerprints.
FBI! Drop the gun!
Ugh! You're making such a mess.
let me do it. Gee...
an exact 180-degree fold.
I guess that's what I should expect from a master of combinatorics.
actually, I used to work at the Gap in high school.
are you sure this is such a good idea?
uh, yeah. Doing FBI work for years without any training , being stalked, getting shot at
more than once
uh, I think it's a pretty excellent idea, actually.
what are they going to have you doing?
it's a little self-defense, some firearms training.
it's no big deal. It'll be good for him. All right?
did I hear something about firearms?
uh, yes, Charlie is going through two days of FBI training.
his idea. What do you mean, my idea?!
it was because you've been asking me forever. Wait a minute...
this does not mean that he gets to carry a gun after this, right? Uh, I don't know - maybe some handcuffs.
hmm, really?
don, U. S. Attorney's office just called.
two RICO witnesses scheduled to testify in the same trial next week were just hit.
david and Colby went to pick up a third, ended up in a gunfight.
okay, I'm on my way.
Hey, I got to go. So, uh, kick ass, all right?
Thanks.
nice. This guy dressed as a delivery man.
obviously put a little thought into it.
an agent from OC I. D.'d him as a low-level gunman in the Albanian mafia.
Uh-huh. What's up?
so we know they were looking for a guy named Reggie Smith, who used to run with the Bixel Street Boyz.
made a deal with the U. S. Attorney's Office to turn against the leader of his own crew.
and the DOJ has been putting him up here for about a month.
he was supposed to testify along with the two victims.
any idea where he is now?
building manager said he took off this afternoon in a real hurry.
right, well, if he thought he was next to get hit...
he's making tracks to get out of town while he still can.
all right, so we better get this guy's Smith's photo out to all the roll calls- I mean, L. A. to Fresno.
if we don't find him, they will.
?are these photos from traffic surveillance cameras?
well, yeah, leather gloves- it's like what, 70 degrees.
kind of telling, huh?
Quantico has no facial matches.
Robin Brooks is in here, taking a dying declaration from the prisoner who was stabbed outside the courthouse.
I know things ended kind of weird for you, so, if it's too uncomfortable, I can take the lead.
I don't care. Uh...
just check with Langley on this, though.
I think the Albanian assassin sounds more like their turf.
Hey. Hey.
no idea you were back.
well, I'm just, um, I'm going to try Langley again.
nice to see you, Robin. You too.
we're building a major RICO case against Jarobi "J-Light" Taylor.
murder, robbery, extortion, kidnapping
he's hit every offense on the list.
he runs the Bixel Street Boyz. I know who he is.
he's like the Don Corleone of the LA gang world.
the guy's so powerful, he can continue running his empire, even from prison.
we can't figure out how he's sending out orders.
and this guy's in Bixel too?
he committed two murders on J-Light's orders last year.
there's no guarantee the judge is going to allow his dying declaration.
Yeah, or if a jury's gonna even buy it.
Reggie Smith also worked as a triggerman for Bixel Street.
you find him, my chances of winning this case increase a hundred percent.
well, I mean, the hits had to be pretty well orchestrated, so I wouldn't be surprised if there were a leak you know, I mean, even in the DOJ.
any information would've gone to J-Light's number two,
Dwight "Heavy" Reddick, worked his way up through Bixel Street, one murder at a time.
he was paroled last year.
I need a list of computers and anyone who had access to J- Light's info, then.
you're talking about hundreds of people, thousands of e-mails.
it could take months to narrow that stuff down.
?When did you come back?
a couple months ago, right after I wrapped that case in Miami.
look, I don't want there to be any friction between us.
don't worry about it.
okay, here's the scenario:
you've just witnessed an armed robbery, multiple shots fired.
ready? Go.
let me just...
make sure I'm... Okay, I'm good there.
what are you doing, Eppes? This isn't driver's Ed.
you're in pursuit!
okay.
the siren, Agent Eppes.
you forgot your siren.
Yeah, so that's right, uh... where is that?
What...?
you just killed a mailbox. Keep your eyes on the road.
Radio- you need to call in your pursuit.
Uh-huh. All righty.
good morning.
this is Charles Eppes.
I'm in pursuit of a...
burgundy-ish, sort of...
merlot-colored, um...
well, what model of car would you say that is?
it's a Ford.
it really doesn't look like a Ford. Anyway, a Ford!
look out!
hey... Speed Racer.
can I borrow him for a minute?
take the afternoon.
how many people had access to the witnesses' information?
um, about 50, but with all the e-mails and the correspondence, it's like thousands.
it's quality not quantity.
in this case, temporal link analysis will prove that.
how so?
imagine an uncut diamond...
Ooh, that's not a problem.
when the diamond's discovered, it's a large uncut stone, under a microscope, the flaws and inclusions become visible.
to maximize profit, they have to cut the stone to remove the imperfections, so that the valuable and brilliant facets are revealed.
similarly, temporal link analysis searches e-mail sent by users who have access to sensitive information.
it removes the bad ones, or the flaws, and reveals the ones that are of true value.
we're looking for an e-mail outside their job parameter?
Yeah, that's exactly it.
Eppes! You're up.
all right, I will call Larry and Amita, and they should be able to help you.
all right. Thanks, Charlie.
and, hey, um...
you want to break into the turn, accelerate on the way out.
okay, thanks.
a watch like that must make you the man in charge, huh?
two dead witnesses were supposed to testify against your boss.
bitch and snitch, wind up in a ditch.
that's what happened to your delivery boy, Reggie Smith?
I wouldn't know anything about that.
but if a accident happens to befall on Reggie, it would be a damn shame.
Yeah, it would free me up to spend all my time going after Bixel Street.
you know you go against me in court.
there's none of these BS plea deals, right?
it's federal- it's 25 to life.
you might want to be thinking twice about your plans to go after Mr. Smith.
Hey. Hey.
so, Heavy's parole status prevented him from visiting J- Light in prison, but it didn't stop a guy named Levi Holt.
48 visits in 12 months.
well, that's how he's passing the orders?
thing is, this guy Holt's the invisible man
no address, no license, no nothing.
huh, and the phone number on the log?
well, it traces back to a Los Angeles recreation center.
wait, I know that place;
that's where, uh, David volunteers.
Yeah, I don't think he's been by in a while, though.
well, I'd say it's time.
so that's the big bad Levi Holt, huh?
maybe I should take a pass at this one alone.
what's this- a black and white thing?
actually...
it's a smooth and a... unsmooth thing.
checkmate.
that's ten dollars, B.
levi Holt?
my friends know to call me Bishop.
well, I'm Special Agent David Sinclair.
what exactly makes you so special?
I don't know.
I guess it's the fact that I talk to the dead.
Yep. Just today,
I had two dead guys tell me a dude by the name of J-Light is responsible for their untimely demise.
according to this log right here, not a week goes by that you don't visit the man.
is that a crime?
I'm giving you the courtesy of doing this here, okay?
now, you want to have this conversation in my office,
I'd be more than happy to call your mother.
if you've seen my mom, then I'm really looking at a psychic.
kid, what do you and J-Light talk about every week?
chess.
chess?
J- Light gives me lessons so I'll stay sharp.
he says I'm some kind of prodigy.
he's the only one that's given a damn about me, so if you're looking to take him down, you're in the wrong place.
that was real smooth, Jay-Z.
yeah...
with more than 5, 000 DOJ e-mails connected to J-Light's trial, your idea of creating a semantic network of terms used in the training data set and matching them with their e-mail uses was brilliant.
when I'm stuck, I've always found the work pattern of a certain Englishman to be inspirational.
sir Isaac Newton.
no, Sherlock Holmes.
from a drop of water a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without ever having seen or heard of one or the other.
but, yeah, Newton was pretty good, too.
look at you guys.
this is kind of like when Captain Kirk used to beam down and he would leave Bones and Chekov in charge.
no, actually, the chain of command went, uh,
uh, we ran an analysis of all communications.
then we ran a second program that looked for a break in the pattern of that user.
and, uh, user number zero-two-one-five-zero-two, stood out in stark contrast to all the others, by far, requesting the most information on all three witnesses.
you sure about this?
quite.
why, is there a problem?
okay, what is it about this office?
Hi.
we've got a problem.
Reggie Smith.
no. You.
you've been asking a lot of questions about the dead witnesses.
I'm the prosecuting attorney.
way too many inquiries into their personal lives.
hold on.
are you really suggesting that I'm on J-Light's payroll?
we've got e-mails from your computer for information about prisoner transports.
one to LAPD, one changing
bell's train ticket, so he got here an hour earlier.
so, I mean, you tell me.
don, we spent six months together.
you know me.
what are they doing?
I need an official statement.
go to hell.
call me crazy, but Robin doesn't seem the type to give up years of public service for the dark side.
Hey, look, you gave me the files.
don't you think you might be a little bit biased because of your past relationship?
what am I supposed to do?
I don't know.
but I can tell you, after Colby,
I never look at an investigation the same way.
David, what a nice surprise.
how you doing, Mr. Eppes?
Hey. You know, two gallons a day keeps the pipes clean.
uh, no, this is not for me, it's, uh, for the toilet.
I'm recycling rainwater.
the new system holds up to 1, 200 liters.
Oh, by the way, if you're looking for Don - Actually,
I need... you. or even Charlie - I can't help you.
me?
how long does it take to learn how to play chess?
years.
I only have this afternoon.
well, I guess we better get started.
Oh, uh, by the way, speed chess is just the name of the game.
it's not how long it takes to learn it.
Yeah.
Hey, so Gary Bell received a call.
it was from this number right here.
the phone was cloned.
NSA has got this new technology where you can download media from a cell phone without the owner ever realizing, so we were able to pull down these two pictures that were sent to the killer's phone.
and the next one's still a mystery, 'cause we weren't able to download all of it.
Yeah, you remember Charlie helped us find that plane with the shadows of the sun or something?
Yeah.
Eppes, you're up.
prisoner escort.
just follow me, sir. And go.
okay, buddy, walk it off, huh?
Paul, give me a minute here.
no problem.
this is good. This is going,
I mean I feel really good about the whole thing.
Yeah, I can see that.
look, you got to do me a favor.
think you can dial us into where this is?
Yeah. Yeah, uh...
okay, so, multiclass labeling supervising system.
picture a cadaver and let dog search for a body.
if you give the dog a photo of the subject, that's useless.
but if you give the dog a piece of the subject's clothing, it's going to key off the scent.
SML algorithm works the same.
it looks for its own scent or information by scanning millions of images on the Internet and finding a match.
all right, great.
so... I'm going to need to call Amita and Larry again.
Hey, Eppes!
you done yapping?
you're up.
you got any advice for me here?
Yeah, just shake his hand and kick him in the nuts.
same advice you gave me in elementary school.
well, it worked then, right? Yeah.
now, uh, this tactic is called a "pin."
by the way, who is your adversary?
uh, it's a 14-year-old kid.
uh...
his mom died, now he, uh, idolizes a gang leader.
well, having raised two boys myself
I can tell you that age, it's a difficult time for any teen.
I don't mean to be rude, Mr. Eppes, but I seriously doubt
don or Charlie ever had to, you know, wonder where their next meal was coming from, you know?
Yeah, well, the pressure to be a man, the need for guidance doesn't know any income brackets.
knight to C3.
Aah... Damn it.
at least it's not porn.
that'd be Granger's computer.
only on Saturday nights.
Oh, boy.
so, Robin Brooks' office subcontracts all their I. T. work.
I see right here she had her computer serviced six times in the past year.
look at this: Five of the service calls were the same tech- Angie Heath.
I can't believe the International Olympic Committee actually considers this a sport.
I can't believe you're this bad at it. Here we go.
4-5-9, we got a burglary.
Hey, look who she's arrested with.
Reggie Smith, our missing witness.
says they're married, and then divorced a year later.
okay, so,
Angie steals the information from Robin's computer, passes it to J-Light who orders the hit from jail.
until her ex-husband becomes the next target.
she gets nostalgic, goes ahead and tips him off.
$50 says if we find Angie, Reggie Smith is laying right there next to her.
well, last known address is a loft downtown.
the size of the entry wound,
I'm betting that's a 22 caliber.
the same caliber that killed Bell.
another contract killing.
how did J-Light find them?
I don't know.
but you shoot somebody in the kneecaps, you're making a point.
Oh, so you heard?
I don't care, Don.
Robin, come on.
I mean, what, you would've done the same thing.
no, I wouldn't have.
I would have thought about who you are, and trusted my gut.
and so would the Don Eppes I knew.
here's the weird thing:
Angie Heath's last five phone calls, they were all to J-Light's top lieutenant, Heavy.
now, why would she call the people trying to kill her?
what's that in her mouth?
that's a hundred dollar bill.
each one had one stuffed in their mouth.
I think it's a message of some kind.
no, they're tying to buy their freedom.
it's more like an answer.
don Whoa!
check it out.
Hey.
we're doing dynamic entries.
that's when you break in to a typical hostage...
Yeah, I think we know a thing or two about it.
gave you a machine gun, huh?
it fires paint pellets instead of bullets, but, as I've learned, those can be very painful.
especially when they get under your skin.
well, what can we do for you, Rambo?
Oh, right. I'm here because, um...
whoa, whoa. Wait just...
point it down. Just point it down.
stupid thing.
uh, Larry and Amita have found a match for your photograph.
here we go.
uh... I don't know the significance, but it's somewhere in the Valley.
wait, what, you're kidding.
that's Robin's house.
what? Will she be the next one on the hit list??
?How is it going,Jimmy?- Is it all right?
all right, I'll see you in a little while. See you in a bit.
I remember we talked about spending a weekend someplace like this.
didn't think it would be with an hourly changing of the guards.
with Smith dead, the only thing we got to convict J-Light is that dying declaration you took.
which is a nice way of saying I'm next on the hit list.
well, that's not going to happen.
so now you're on my side?
I don't choose sides.
come on, you know that.
you can be a real bastard sometimes.
my shrink said something like that.
this shrink...
has he taught you how to say "I was wrong" yet?
so, Gary Bell was the first witness killed.
two people have I. D.'d this woman as walking with him minutes before he was shot.
courtesy of Interpol- her name's Coral.
she's a contract killer for the Albanian mob.
well, I guess, with his own crew testifying against him,
J- Light didn't want to trust the locals to do the job.
which means we still have a professional hit woman running around town.
Oh. I take it the tactical assault didn't go too well.
according to my instructor, in the event of a firefight, my best course of action would be to get in a fetal position and call for my mama.
well, that's rather ironic.
my flight instructor told me the same thing.
thanks to my brother, the Eppes name has some reputation around the FBI.
Oh, rather, thanks to both of you.
and I don't want to tarnish either one of them.
I think I'm in over my head here.
I mean, some of these guys are animals.
how did he put it?
strength comes not from physical capacity, but from indomitable will.
Yeah, well, Gandhi never had to lead an HRT.
mm, no.
I'm used to a certain level of success.
these guys are laughing at me.
you know, Charlie, think back now to when you were a 13-year-old freshman at Princeton.
there were plenty of your fellow students who were keenly jealous of you.
this your way of telling me I was hated?
well... no.
I mean, hated is a strong word.
uh, detested.
but you won their respect.
you did, with your integrity, your kind soul, and most importantly of all, you were smarter than every single one of 'em.
now, listen to me.
you have a gift.
so, where does it say your brain must only be used for math?
checkmate.
are you for real?
only one way to find out.
okay.
you can go first.
you're white. You go first.
it's the rules.
right.
I knew that.
come on, man. I got a life to lead.
your move.
checkmate.
it's your money. Let's go.
all right...
checkmate.
had enough?
you know, my dad used to play chess.
must not have been any good.
actually, he was the, uh, champion of the Botanical Gardens.
you know, it was kind of like the MacArthur Park in my neighborhood.
maybe you ought to call him for some lessons.
Yeah, I wish I could.
my dad passed away when I was right about your age.
better than him not being there at all.
not easy being the man of the house, is it?
but, Bishop, part of being a man is taking responsibility for your actions.
J- Light is good with me.
I don't concern myself with his other stuff.
Ah, but you should, 'cause sooner or later, that stuff it has a way of catching up with you.
okay?
all right, now,
I looked at the security video from the prison.
that notebook you carry around...
look, I need to know what's inside of it.
chess.
must be real lousy being you, never being able to trust anyone.
it's not true
what you said before about not choosing sides.
you do it all the time.
that had nothing to do with us.
I mean, I'll give you- you did mess me up pretty good.
things get too close, I kind of got a habit of running.
that's funny. I thought that was my MO.
maybe that's why we worked for a while.
all right, so, you know, what was it, ultimately?
you remember when I was sleeping over all the time, and you gave me that drawer?
Yeah.
the only thing you kept in it was a hair clip.
well, I showed up for work one day and realized that I took the hair clip with me.
Hey, Don, it's Jimmy, here to relieve you.
be at the door in two secs.
Yeah, all right, Jimmy.
well, I'll see you in a little while.
nice!
nice shooting.
275
highest yet.
next group up.
eyes and ears in place.
line is hot.
ready on the firing line.
I can't believe it.
296. High score.
how'd you do it?
some kind of math formula?
fast is fine, but accuracy is final.
you need to learn to be slow in a hurry.
Wyatt Earp.
your dinner is served, madam.
your table.
here you are.
need to get the number for your shrink, thank him.
voil?
what's this?
uh, that would be for you.
a hair clip.
don, it's Jimmy. I'm outside the door.
security is ready for you.
you got to be kidding.
I'm on the clock.
what am I gonna do?
I got to walk the grounds with hotel security.
I will be back- I promise, okay?
Oh, hey.
Oh, I'm so glad you guys are here.
are you busy?
Oh, I'm just trying to find the existence of a massive scalar elementary particle, predicted to exist by the standard model of particle physics.
cool. Well, when you're done, do you think you'll have time to look at this?
a list of murder victims.
Mm-hmm.
who is J-Light?
uh, the person who wrote the list, who ordered the murders from jail.
well, he must have been monitored.
he is, so we think he's using a code.
david thinks he's passing the code to this kid while he's teaching him chess lessons.
well, the beautiful thing about chess is that both opponents know everything.
nothing's hidden.
so within the lesson, perhaps the coded message lies.
if that's the case, can you crack it?
I don't know. I mean, normally, we'd need a cipher, but.
Yeah, but in this case, we have the victims' names or the results, so by using backwards induction, we might be able to crack it.
it's like the Rosetta Stone:
the same exact text is written in three different languages, so, if you can understand just one, then you should be able to read the other two.
my algorithm will be looking for overlaps between the sets of data the victims and the chess lessons.
then I'll translate the unknown code by comparing it to the known murders and their gang affiliations.
great. Sorry to blow off those elementary particles.
Oh, anytime.
help yourself.
I'm gonna go work.
Thanks.
Robin, run!
3696. Need immediate assistance.
I've been stabbed.
subject is a female Caucasian armed with a knife.
she's in pursuit of my protectee.
somebody help! Somebody help me, please!
all right, all right.
you all right?
okay, come on, come on.
I got you.
I thought I was...
how did you find me?
I had a little help.
I don't understand.
tracking device.
J- Light's not going to stop until...
he's not going to get you.
so I talked to the hospital Jimmy's out of surgery.
he's going to be okay.
kid got to you a little bit, huh?
treating him like any other perp.
Yeah, but he's not.
I grew up with kids like him, you know?
I've seen the way this movie ends.
doesn't sound like any other perp.
okay.
you have all the answers, let's hear it.
well, why don't you just stop pretending you don't give a crap and change the damn ending?
Hey.
how's it going? Welcome back.
thank you.
Aah... please.
what? My ribs.
sorry. Yeah, it's okay.
um, I just think I may have split my lip.
okay.
what's that?
Oh, this is just a little certificate stating my marksmanship qualifications.
Larry, Yay!
I am very impressed with you for doing this, Charlie.
thank you.
so, dimensional data sets.
each week, this man J-Light has a chess lesson.
now, David thinks a code is maybe being passed within the lesson. I've run a computer program to try to analyze all optimal chess moves, and... I still can't break the cipher.
well...
in my FBI profiling seminar, we learned that the notion of "thinking like a criminal"
is actually a misnomer because criminals are sociopaths, and in order to match wits with them, you actually have to think contrary to your normal thought process.
so we've been assuming that J-Light was teaching Bishop all the optimal moves when...
it may have been just the opposite.
coral tracked Robin by the GPS on her Blackberry.
that's pretty smart.
don has SWAT watching her 24-7.
okay, so we figured out the code.
or they figured out the code.
so each week, during their lesson,
J- Light teaches Bishop one move or countermove for him to master.
when decoded, they reveal a direct order from J-Light.
each of the 64 squares represents a different gang.
now, the king's last position shows which gang was being targeted.
and the piece used to checkmate indicates how high in the organization.
for example, this lesson featured an attack on the black center by means of an E4 to D5 advance, indicating that a pawn, or low-level gangbanger, in the Midtown Highboys should be killed.
if we can figure out J- Light's next chess lesson, we can figure out his next hit.
Hey.
game's over.
you, get lost.
what's your problem?
Where's your notebook?
it belongs to me.
it's evidence that'll be used against you in your murder trial if you don't give it to me right now. Look, if you're trying to scare me, it's not going to work.
I'm not trying to scare you, okay?
I'm trying to help you.
I know what happens to kids like you.
Oh, so now you think me and you are from the same place?
well, we ain't.
Yeah, you're right, because I grew up with a family that loved and supported me, so we're not the same, but you're also wrong- 'cause I do care about you.
I want to see you become the man that I know you can be.
the man your father never was.
one day, me and this kid got into this thing at school.
I had to wait in the principal's office until my dad showed up.
he never did.
J- Light came instead.
and what about Heavy?
it never seemed strange to you
his passion for your chess lessons?
Bishop, every time he reads your notebook, somebody else out here dies.
now, come on, kid.
I am not that dumb...
and you're way too smart.
second move, white, 2 to C4.
uh, no, I'm positive it's Sicilian, I'm positive.
where do you even see Sicilian? How can it possibly be...
it's the Nimzo-Indian Defense.
the proper reply is pawn to E6, freeing up the king's bishop.
David, this is gonna take a minute here.
all right, I'll punch those variations in.
and I shall watch.
here we go.
Bishop to B6.
and the proper response is...
that's J-Light's own gang.
like a modern day Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, that boy is delivering his own death letter.
David, he's sending an order to kill Bishop.
Hey, let's go.
up, let's go.
you stand right here, okay?
you don't move.
yo, Bish. What up, Heavy?
what up, Bone? Why didn't you come by with the book?
I've been waiting for an hour.
you have something to say?
say it. FBI.
this ain't gonna end real good for you.
walk away.
that's not gonna happen.
I said walk away.
what are you strapping?
a nine?
what's that?
15, 16 rounds?
me and Bone right here, we're nice with the trigger.
our gats are four times that action.
and homeboy's got plenty more in the car.
you'll be ghost in two seconds.
well, you better hope so.
if I get off even one shot, it's going right between your eyes.
well, I guess we're gonna have to find out then, huh?
Yeah, we're also gonna find out if you're ready to run, because after you kill a federal agent, ain't no corner on this man's Earth that's gonna be far enough for you to hide in.
pull what you got, Heavy.
understand this- you kill me right now, you might as well put that gun to your own head.
all right, yo, we can do this another day.
but this ain't over, not by a long shot.
remember this, 'cause you're gonna see it again real soon.
I look forward to that.
hands up. Put 'em where I can see 'em.
turn off the radio.
might even be taking a picture of that face a little sooner than you think.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I mean, I can't say the weekend worked out exactly as I hoped, but...
I admit I had a rescue fantasy dream, but this was a bit much.
Thanks.
Oh, yeah? Was I in it?
you know, my trial starts on Monday, but maybe when things settle, you can find out.
Hey.
technically, I mean, the FBI still owns the room.
we never did finish that candlelight dinner.
Yeah, it'd be a shame to waste the government's money, right?
we're just going to be a little while longer.
Thanks.
okay, everyone, watch your step.
watch my step?
I can't even see my step.
I'm all for adventure, but the suspense is starting to kill me.
this from a man who lived 100 miles above the Earth?
224 to be exact.
I think it's exciting.
okay.
who's first?
nobody's money to take this afternoon?
don't really feel much like playing.
Yeah.
sometimes we're blind to the things that are closest to us.
I think you had it right the first time.
I shut my eyes on purpose.
it's not our mistakes that define us, Bishop.
it's what we do afterward that counts the most.
mind if I give you some advice?
I have a say in it? No.
way I see it, you have two options ahead of you.
option number one
you get tough.
now, you're a smart kid.
get your own crew, you make some money.
I guarantee you, you'll be dead and buried by the time you are 20.
what's choice number two?
start choosing your friends just a little more wisely.
and you can start by teaching me...
how to play some chess.
friends don't take money from friends.
all right, good.
I'm going to lose it, anyway.
okay, you need to start with the basics.
this is the pawn.
hopefully you knew that.
it moves up two spaces in the beginning move and one space thereafter.
Tim, it's milepost 112-9.
Roger that. MP 112-9.
dispatch, this is Desert Pacific Rail. Just passing MP 112-9.
we will be at the switch in five minutes.
got you, Desert Pacific Rail. What's your speed?
we are highballing at 20.
what are you pulling?
10, 000 tons of American ingenuity.
: all right.
I'll keep an eye on her.
do you mind?
you have an audience.
sorry. We're cool.
thank you.
pretty soon, that'll be you with a pretty girl like that. -No way.
William, what's wrong?
Hey, can I ride up front with you?
well, maybe on the return trip, okay?
you know you're not supposed to call me unless it's an emergency.
okay, Dad.
the flag's not up.
he didn't make the switch. -I know.
dispatch, this is Desert Pacific Rail. Do you read me? Over.
we're not going to make it.
I can't get it stopped.
dispatch, this is Desert Pacific Rail. Do you read me?
jump, Tim.
dispatch... -Tim, jump!
dispatch, San Jose Limited, coming your way.
dispatch?
young man...
I'm going to go see my dad.
you know you can't go up there when the train is moving.
he said I could... -William.
I may be old, but I ain't stupid.
what's going on up there? What's on my track?
stay in your seats! Hold on!
come on!
mom! William!
I got him!
I mean, when I started at the FBI, I figure, you know, I'm doing something good.
I'm fighting the fight.
it just sounds so...
old-fashioned. It just sounds so naive now.
no, no. It doesn't.
it's all just one big compromise.
I'm telling you. One big personality clash with redundant paperwork.
the boss is second-guessing every move, second-guessing their bosses, everyone just trying to keep their job.
nobody's got any guts.
Yeah, well, you got guts.
I feel lost.
I feel like...
I don't know why I'm in it anymore.
who's winning?
actually, uh, I got to get out of here.
Yeah. Eppes.
I'm so tired, I could sleep standing up.
the stakeout was worth it.
I loved the look on that guy's face when we sashayed in there instead of that teenage girl.
we got two days away from the creeps. You goany plans?
whatever sport is on TV.
got a train crash.
call NTSB. -They called us.
possible hazardous materials. High threat, urban area.
by hazardous materials, you mean old computer batteries?
no rest for the weary.
I want to know what was on every one of those trains, so e-mail me that waybill, ASAP.
send it to my phone.
you think we're dealing with anything toxic here? -Still checking.
we might have to evacuate the entire area. The press is going to be all over this.
LAPD's got 'em blocked off a mile away.
where do you guys need us? -What do you think?
I could use the manpower. -You got it.
why don't you go see if you can find the NTSB, and you go with him, all right?
Hey, I got her.
I got her. Let's go.
easy, easy... easy.
we're setting triage up over there. -Okay. I'll bring more over.
anybody in there? Oh...
anybody in here? -David! Get out of here!
there are people inside... -We've got a toxic leak!
there's a toxic leak!
everyone, get away from the train!
I have a press conference to do in ten minutes.
all right. So what do you need?
we've still got dozens more people to pl out.
we're going to have to go for the numbers.
got to save as many lives as possible.
listen, there are still passengers here in this car underneath the leaking tanker.
by t time we get to them, they'll be dead.
look, let me just see what my guys can do, all right?
over here! A problem!
okay, so who knows what? Talk to me!
sheriff's Department is evacuating a five-mile radius around the site.
then you guys should go help FD with extractions on that tanker.
what's the chemical? What do we need to know?
methyl isocyanate.
it's used in the manufacture of polyurethane foam, pesticides and plastics.
that's the same chemical that killed over 3, 000 people in Bhopal, India.
it's basically a weapon. So how bad's the leak?
well, if it's bad, we're all dead. Yeah.
hazmat measured two parts per million-- not fatal.
if you start tearing up, or start to smell something sweet, that indicates four parts per million, in which case, run.
but even small amounts could be lethal to the wounded people, right?
it's transported in liquid form.
when it hits the air, it vaporizes but, with water, it overheats and combusts, releasing a toxic cloud.
we need to get those people out of here before this thing explodes.
all right. Let's go. -You guys be careful.
so the black box is basically destroyed. It's not going to help us.
trains are monitored by computer-- I'll get the electronic records from the company's hard drive.
see if you can find out who knew that cargo was toxic.
and dog the bomb squad until we know what set it off, right?
I need a list of all National Security events in the last 24 hours.
are you thinking terrorism?
go. Go.
Yeah, I'll hold.
excuse me. Are you in charge?
we're not quite at the level of rogue, shape-shifting nanobots as described in science fiction.
however, we have made progress in the real world-- swarmbots.
alone, unsophisticated machines.
but, working together, with something like... like intelligence emerging.
these are crash investigators.
here. Check it out.
so I program a task for the swarm, right?
let's say I'm mapping this room, and they try to accomplish the goal of that task.
right now, they're self-organizing. They've chosen a leader.
see, some jobs need centralized control. Others require swarm activity.
Hey, Charlie, what happens if I shoot the leader?
they figure out who the next best leader is.
see that?
look. They just keep going.
it's much more robust and cooperative in a hostile environment than people.
you're familiar with eusocial insects like bees and ants and termites.
well, they communicate through pheromones-- scent clues.
Like,"I'm a larva. Take care of me."
Or,"Food's this way." Or,"Danger! Attack!
following smells is called chemotaxis.
my bots employ infotaxis, which is a spatial search algorithm in which agents repeatedly update guesses of an object's location.
each bot creates a model of its local environment, it networks it, and we get a collective picture.
these things could map my crash? -That's what I'm saying.
I can reprogram them, I can add lipstick cameras and chemical sensors.
the switch wasn't right.
we couldn't stop in time. -Why not?
it's a redundant system, but everything seemed to fail at once.
Cutty exerted the right amount of brake pressure for the tonnage, but the train just kept going.
tell me about your engineer-- Cutty Nagim.
he wouldn't abandon the train, even though we were sitting on 2, 000 tons of diesel.
did you recover the body? -Not yet.
what kind of name is Nagim?
syrian, I think.
did he have ties to Syria? Was he political?
I'm going to find all this out. You might as well just say what you know.
Cutty was born and raised in America.
you know what, Tim?
maybe all the parts in your redundant system just happened to fail at the same time, but that passenger train missed piercing a tanker carrying a lethal chemical by about ten feet.
Oh, that's just a matter of time, Agent.
scary hazardous materials roll through L. A. every single day on 100-year-old tracks with rusty, unguarded switches.
it's a miracle it hasn't happened up to this point-- a miracle.
stay put.
Hey, thanks for coming.
Yeah, uh, so where should I set up? -In here.
I'm downloading the railroad's electronic records. -Okay.
this is much worse than I thought. I don't knowf my bots can make a difference.
Charlie, the people we're going for are the lost causes.
anything we can do for them is better than nothing.
Hey, what's the chemical count?
it's the same-- two parts per million, but they haven't located the leak yet.
how many we got in here?
six remain that are still giving off body heat, but they're buried deep inside.
can I set up over here? -Yeah, sure, Charlie.
are these the, um... -The six still alive.
that's, uh, Estella, William Ramirez. They're the wife and son of the engineer.
probably died in the initial fireball.
Frannie Driscoll, her daughter was rescued earlier.
and that's Doug Abbott, 21. He's, uh, traveling with Susan Lang, 19.
jeffrey Knight, railroad steward. He has a radio, but it's dying.
Hey, Mr. Knight, this is Agent Granger again. How're you doing in ther
william and I are hanging in.
I can't see the others. -My leg hurts!
you're a tough guy, right?
Where's my dad? Is he okay?
Hey, buddy, you dad wants you to be brave, okay?
you can do that, right?
radio's dead. -So can we get them out of there?
we're worried about destabilizing the wreckage, or worse, the tanker.
well, my bots should help with that. -How?
they're going to explore the debris.
they'll radio back information on toxicity, temperature, topography.
I'll add that to your infrared layout.
we'll get a detailed map, and we're going to get these people out of there safely.
all right, I think I can get to this one right here.
yeah? -I'm gonna go for it.
all right, Charlie.
what did the bomb squad say?
do they have any idea what caused the railment?
they can't find the set-off point.
it could be on the track, in which case, it would be under the wreckage.
or a bomb could've been on the cargo train itself, the engineer was Syrian.
either way, it derails.
the passenger train pierces the tanker, ignites the chemicals, releases toxic gas into a denselyopulated area.
what are you basing your theory on?
don's thinking terrorism.
what, are you talking for me? Don't do that.
you implied that...
you need to listen more and talk less. Understand?
so we got no national security events in the area in the last 24 hours.
I'm running a Risk Measure with data from the railroad, the chemical company, the NSA and the FBI Counter-terrorism Unit.
but a terrorist attack is not well-supported.
right-- and what'd the dispatcher say?
James Malin. NTSB intervied him on the scene, did a drug-alcohol test, then I released him to go to his second job.
you what? -NTSB already interviewed him.
we do our own interviews. Go pick him up again.
all right, I'll check on the Syrian engineer's terrorist connections.
you know, just for kicks.
Amita, what do you think? An accident?
I mean, there's no apparent equipment or system failures.
but I'm going through every keystroke and voice communication up to the crash.
now, I'll have more of an opinioin a few hours.
medic!
we need a medic over here!
you okay? -Yeah, I'm okay.
she's the last one I could pull out without destabilizing the whole pile, though.
easy.
How're the robots coming?
it's gonna be a little while.
where...
Where's my son?
it's okay, ma'am. Take it easy.
he's probably already been taken to the hospital, ma'am. He's okay.
no, no, no! William was in front of me.
your son is William? -Yes!
he's asthmatic; I have to get him!
easy, easy. You let us take care of that. You let us take care of it.
Where's my husband? Ralph Ramirez.
he was driving the train. Where is he?
I'm sorry.
No!
No! William!
I have to get William, please! -Take it easy.
: I have to get William! William!
hazmat found one of the leaks, but air quality remains the same at two parts per million.
we'll see if it dissipates in the next hour.
there's no way of knowing what's inside the crushed car.
Charlie just inserted the robots into the pile.
the swarmbots are giving us an excellent transmission.
it's looking for heat signatures.
: okay.
we have a fatality.
Yeah, but it looks like there's a void right here we could probably climb into.
no, no. The bots are reporting instability in that quadrant.
I believe the, uh, deceased is Frannie Driscoll.
well, she was alive, generating a heat signal, just a couple hours ago.
she probably couldn't handle the methyl isocyanate.
you said the levels weren't high enough to kill anybody.
not enough to kill a healthy adult, but the wounded, weakened, children and the elderly are much more vulnerable.
so the boy and the old man are in trouble.
william is more at risk to corrosive agents, because of the smaller diameter of his airways.
William, it'll be okay. You're gonna be all right, okay?
we're coming for you. -She got the boy on his cell phone.
William, William, are you there?
I lost him, I lost him. -I'll get cell phone numbers for the rest of them.
did they get everybody out? -You were the dispatcher.
why were you in such a rush to leave the scene?
I got two jobs.
and if I lose this one 'cause of the accident...
why would you lose your job?
somebody's got to take the fall.
ain't usually the big dogs.
so, if it's me, I really need the second job.
I-I got seven kids, my wife's got Lupus...
tell me about last night.
shift starts at 4: 00. Nothing unusual.
around 7: 00, the Desert Pacific Rider checks in at mile post 112-9, and I authorize the switch at the south yard.
the conductor said that the switch flag wasn't up.
maybe it was stuck.
but I doubt it.
cause if there's any mechanical problems, it shows up on my screen and the train's computer and about three or four backups.
NTSB said no mechanical failure.
just check the records.
I activated the switch when the train was five minutes out.
and it-it worked.
why would the conductor lie?
maybe he was coming in too fast.
maybe he was doped up.
his tox screen was clean, like yours.
maybe it was a bomb.
it was terrorists? Have you thought about that?
you think it was a derailment?
you have to get those passengers out of there.
this crash could be the end of my business.
let me ask you something: You guys run old trains? -No, nothing like that.
until a couple months ago, these hazardous chemicals were transported by Markovius Trucking.
Roman Markovius? -Yeah.
the mobster; the king of trucking. I underbid him.
what, he threaten you?
well, he let me know he doesn't like losing money.
but he better get used to it; trucks are history.
he puts me out of business, someone else is gonna pop up to take my place.
this one looks promising.
could you get another one of your bots over there to check it out?
they've already figured out that they need to explore that passage.
it's okay, baby. It won't be long now, okay?
you try and slow down your breathing, okay?
there's a leg right there. -It's a child's.
William! Oh, no, William!
Hey, hey, it's okay, buddy. No, it's all right.
what's wrong? -No, buddy, it's okay.
your m-mom's fine.
she's doing just fine. All right?
we're about to suit up, and we're gonna come in there, and we're gonna come get you.
all right? It's gonna be a cool rescue.
like Iron Man.
now, we're gonna need your help, too. Okay, buddy?
what's wrong with my mom?
okay, baby, I'm back.
okay, you be brave.
come here a minute.
what's going on? -Man, you got to be careful.
there's a possibility that kid's not gonna make it. You got to brace yourself for that.
all right?
word is you don't like to lose money. -Well, luckily, that's not happening.
you just lost a big contract to Desert Pafic Rail.
in general, business is good.
specifically, I am not incentivized to sabotage railroads, as you are no doubt about to accuse me.
Incentive-what?
I just bought a sizable stake in rail transport.
it's my business now. Why would I harm it?
well, one reason is you'd bring prices down. You could snatch up inventory.
you think like a criminal.
that's how I catch them.
diversification works better than breaking kneecaps. So I diversified.
we didn't touch Desert Pacific Rail.
richard Cory sows the seeds of his own demise.
whatever that means.
213-555-0172. That's Douglas Abbott, 21, Portland, Oregon.
this is Agent Granger of the FBI.
great, man. Where you been?
listen, we're coming in to get you.
Hey, ask him about the person next to him. -Okay.
all right, David, memorize this.
nine meters six meters left 30 degrees, seven meters right 15 degrees-- you got it?
got it.
all right. Susan Lang. She's 19. Seems to have a broken arm, but otherwise...
this metal...it's cooled down now. I think I can push it out of the way.
what's he doing? No, he'll cause a collapse.
no, no, no. Tell him to stop! Tell him not to move.
Doug, wait a minute. Doug, don't-don't try to help.
don't move anything. -No!
Doug, can you hear me?
Hey. We can find ice on Mars, but we can't get people out of tangled metal 20 feet away.
COLB You should try and catch some Z's, David.
we've been going, like, 40 hours now.
the other case was yesterday-- it feels like a week ago.
look, uh, did you... have you talked to, uh, Doug and Susan's parents in Oregon?
did you call them?
we don't legally know they're dead.
their heat signatures are gone; they're dead, okay? And we know it.
did you talk to the parents or not?
they're flying in, David. Take a break, all right?
napping is the smartest thing you can do right now.
here's what I want to know. The geniuses, they lost half of their robots in the collapse. Right?
now they're starting over, and they're mapping us a way inside.
how long do we wait?
you gotta just chill, man.
you're doing great, baby. Be brave for Mama, okay?
how's he doing?
hold on, William-- I'll be right back.
he can't breathe. It's getting worse.
try to get him to, uh, remain calm.
how long are we supposed to wait on this Yellow Brick Road of yours?
dial down your attitude, man, I... -No.
we lost six robots and two people in that last collapse. Now, you give me a firm percentage.
how much of what you're working on is hot air? -Hot air?
50%? 60%? You just tell me.
you want to cause 50 tons of steel to crush this kid and crack open a toxic tanker so that we can all be dead in the next half hour, then you be my guest and dive in there!
you can't guarantee that it's not gonna happen when I have a new map!
David, patience-- "patience achieves more than force. " Edmund Burke, statesman.
you take patience too far, and then you have cowardice.
george Jackson, Black Panther.
I have reprogrammed this bot to locate William's cell phone-- it should find the most efficient route.
for a six-inch Tinker Toy.
I need... I need to get in there. I need you to find a space that I can fit in.
that's what the other bots are working on, okay? Listen.
listen-- William's low body weight makes him more susceptible to those toxins, all right?
so, yeah, he's...
he's dying. -He's dying.
Yeah, I know that. And if he gets this inhaler, then it'll buy us more time to get to him.
: all right.
I can't find what caused the derailment.
I mean, the switch happened four minutes before the crash.
how do you know that?
because it's recorded here in the computer output.
Yeah, but what's recorded?
the time of the dispatcher hitting the button or the actual switching of the iron pieces?
that's a good question.
the switching sequence requires two actions from the dispatcher.
he entered the first command at 7: 01, before the crash.
then nothing for three and a half minutes.
derailment occurred at 7: 04.
the second command switch was entered seven seconds later, after the crash.
NTSB said that the switch happened on time at 7: 01.
think of it as a plane that's scheduled to depart at 7: 00.
if it leaves the gate at 7: 00, then taxis across the tarmac and actually takes off at 7: 04, the public record has it down as an on-time departure at 7: 00.
the time of the first command is often recorded as the time of completion, usually because it's just a few seconds difference.
he starts the sequence, but he doesn't finish.
and then, after derailment, he finishes it on the computer, even though the actual physical switch had already been destroyed.
but it's all recorded as if it happened before the crash.
and we're absolutely sure the command came from the dispatcher's computer, right? Not, like, a hacker...
well, I'm working on an electronic fingerprint.
all right, good. Let me know if you get anywhere with that.
and Markovius was telling the truth about buying a stake in the rail business.
the Organized Crime Task Force says he doesn't need to play dirty, you know?
he makes his money inside the system just like any other greedy businessman.
right, like Richard Cory-- I mean, that guy bugs me.
I'll put him under the microscope, see what I find.
let's get that dispatcher back in here, all right?
Mr. Malin, hey. Come on, wake up.
anyone visit you at work last night?
no. -No?
Oh, wait a minute.
I'm not sure.
what night is it now? What's today's date?
last night was the night of the crash. Did anyone visit you?
no.
we have logs. You could check 'em.
no one paid you to look the other way while they got on your computer?
are you crazy?
I would never do that.
you fell asleep.
look at you, you can't even keep your eyes open. That's what happened, isn't it?
you fell asleep while you were making the switch. -No. Why are you...
the alarms went off, and you woke up, and then you finished it.
I made the switch.
Mr. Malin, that switch was made after the crash. This is a fact; we know it.
my wife is sick.
so I got to take care of the kids between my jobs.
I haven't slept...
in about a week.
last night, I...
I had trouble focusing my eyes, so...
I thought I finished the switch, and...
I went in the bathroom to put some cold water on my face.
it used to be that there were t of us who worked the same shift, but...
the company made cutbacks.
I came back in the room, the alarms were going off, and...
like you said, I just...
I didn't mean to.
: I'm sorry. I am so sorry.
the little bot who could.
okay, William, listen up, buddy We have this little robot that's gonna make its way over to you, all right?
it's gonna bring you some medicine, it's gonna help you with your breathing, okay?
: okay.
I'm...thirsty. -I know, I know.
you're doing a great job, buddy.
can you put Mr. Knight on the phone? Can you do that?
three more meters.
this map will be complete in a half hour, if William can just hold on.
no, no, no.
what? What? What happened?
hold on. Hold on, Mr. Knight, hold on.
it can't cross. -Why?
because this bot has to link to the other bots in order to cross an opening over ten inches wide.
listen, now, we're gonna need you to help us out here. Okay?
we need you to keep William breathing slowly.
I can do that. -All right.
you think I-I... you think I'm holding something back?
David, we're close. -You've been saying that all night!
David, please.
no more waiting, Charlie. Okay?
no more waiting. -Now, come on. David.
no.
David's gone into the pile without the map.
where is he? -I don't know.
come on, come on. Okay, that's him.
all right, he's on track so far. He's been studying that map for the last hour.
David, can you hear me? -He can hear you.
all right, buddy, stay cool-- you're doing great.
that's a hot zone. It's a hot zone.
what does that mean? Is it toxic?
no, but there's fire under that section. That metal's really hot-- tell him to stay right.
all right, David, you got to stay right. Stay to the right, David.
to the right.
David, can you hear me? David!
what happened?
he went in for the rescue before the route was clear; he's not answering.
Charlie, is he...?
no, his heat signatures are strong. He's alive, but the collapse increased the flow of toxic gas.
how do we get him out? You got any ideas.
well, have a map of the pile before the crash. We know where he went wrong.
what about the robots? -I lost them all.
but look, whatever fell on David didn't kill him, so I estimated a range for that weight and did a progressive collapse analysis-- here.
which tells us...?
which piece of the pick-up sticks to remove to avoid another collapse.
all right, well, tell us where to make a hole. I'll go in on a cable and I'll pull him out.
okay, stop.
all right, guys, down easy; let me down easy.
careful, careful.
David, can you hear me?
William, can you hear me?
Mr. Knight?
jeffrey Knight? -Yes.
can you reach me?
I'm trying.
all right, Charlie, where is he?
he's crawling toward William, Colby. You're not far enough in.
all right, got ya.
I'm at a dead end, guys.
no, that can't be. You must've taken a wrong turn.
well, I did exactly what you said.
nine straight in, six left 30 degrees.
seven right 15 degrees.
Colby, are you counting in meters?
that's the problem. I'm counting in yards.
I'll go back and do it right.
well, you don't have to go back to the beginning.
just go to the first juncture and add 3. 28 feet.
Yeah, give or take, 0.28 feet, got it.
and then recount from there. -Will do.
I should have double-checked that.
it's all right. It's all right. -Everyone's exhausted.
: all right, I see him.
thank you, God. Thank you.
what took you so long, man?
I don't know how to get out of here.
don't worry. I left us bread crumbs.
we need to keep this mask on his face.
I brought an inhaler.
okay, breathe in through that, okay?
why don't you ease him on over here?
okay. All right. Here.
okay, Mr. Knight, it's your turn, sir.
I'm gonna hand you this mask. I want you to put it on your face, okay?
thank you. Thank you.
all right, guys, we're coming out, okay?
okay, good job. You do that.
see you guys on the outside.
Oh, God, ihe okay?
Oh, honey!
is he okay?
send that cable back over here, will ya?
all right, David, it's coming back at ya, buddy.
hang in there, man, it's coming.
I don't know how. Thank you.
made it, Mr. Knight.
we made it.
I'm gonna lift you up, all right?
all right, come on.
easy.
okay, they're on thr way out.
Charlie, listen.
Hey, look, go home. Go get some rest, man.
it's okay.
no...
no, I know what happened.
Hey, I know what happened.
just let me see those train records. I'll be able to prove it.
whoa, whoa, prove what?
listen, even if that switch wasn't in the correct position, that train should have come to a stop based on its weight and speed.
actually, that's what the conductor saw.
he runs his train with math.
mass and velocity determine the distance required to stop, so he must have had the wrong weight.
that train was heavier than that conductor thought, making his calculations for stopping incorrect.
well, that I can check.
you did great.
easy.
Hey, man, great job. -Yeah, yeah.
killed my bots, man.
Yeah, well, they all deserve Purple Hearts.
put little badges on the next ones.
Yeah, armor 'em a little better. -Yeah.
you did great, Mr. Knight.
you did great.
hold on.
all right. Ease off.
sorry about that, Charlie. I had to do it.
it's no sweat. I was about to go in there myself.
agents, thanks for your efforts.
get your hands behind your back. You're under arrest. -For what?
lying about the cargo tonnage in order to save money, so you could undercut bids.
sending out 12, 000 tons. Listed only 10, 000.
who'd you bribe for that, by the way?
maybe there was an error.
Yeah, like, how many times you got away with it.
do you know what? We're gonna find out all about that.
if you'd have played by the rules-- yeah, there would have been a switching error
but that train would have stopped in time.
none of this would've even happened.
tell me that y've never cut corners to get the job done. -Watch your head.
I don't want you doing stuff like that, okay?
I want you being better than me.
you did all right today.
wake up, I'll give you a ride home.
yeah... uh, yeah.

Entropy-- a measure of randomness;
a parameter of disorder;
energy broken down in irretrievable heat.
what might appear to be chaos, even decay, is really a system's way of smoothing out differences;
its search for equilibrium.
too florid?
for 30 overachieving grad students?
probably. But for me...
tell me more about irretrievable heat.
where language might fail us...
the poetries of math and physics bring clarity.
observing spontaneous changes...
in isolated systems.
entropy is our yardstick, measuring progress, defining the boundaries of a story, a beginning and an end.
entropy has the unique ability to choose a particular direction for time.
the Arrow of Time.
the Arrow of Time.
uncorrelated parts interact and find their connections in an evolving system.
so, from one perspective, entropy is a clock, charting the irreversible.
looks like an arrow pointing straight back to L. A.
nice of them to leave us a trail of bread crumbs.
Hey, Sinclair. - Hey, Joe. What do you need?
great big net. Got three men over the wall.
had a car waiting.
tire tracks say older model, long wheel base.
well, that narrows it down.
unless we hear reports about three bad-asses terrorizing the countryside in their underwear, count on a change of clothes, too.
so, they already made it past the roadblocks, huh?
long gone.
look at this here.
Oh, looks like... - Dental floss.
how the hell did they get that much dental floss?
well, that's a very good question.
they must've had a lot of time on their hands.
"they" being...
well, that is why I dialed you in on this.
Hey, Ugly!
ugly? - Uh, yeah, that's Ugly Joe.
there's a Big Joe, Little Joe and an Ugly Joe.
there's a bigger Joe? - No, an uglier one.
damn.
tell me about the other two.
doesn't look like he's had any time to commit a crime where he didn't get caught.
started off low-level drug dealing. Couldn't make that work.
Yeah, I just read something like 95% of small businesses fail their first year.
he's not a bad-looking cat.
Really?
Oh, but when you guys notice, it's okay.
all right, come on. Next.
he's an Aryan-looking individual, but he's pretty ethnically enlightened.
he freelanced for the Colombians, the Jamaicans, the Russians...
as?
hit man-- dropped at least six bodies we know of.
OC moved four others into the "pending inactive" column as likely but unprovable.
anything with known associates?
I just got the files, boss.
all right. It's a fugitive case just like any other.
you know, any other case, the first thing I look at is the guy who shot his wife.
go to the second.
okay.
buck Winters, 17 years old, hooks up with his teacher, Crystal Hoyle.
buck's father already beats the crap out of him on a regular basis
he finds out, he beats some more of the crap out of him.
buck killed him for trying to keep them apart.
pit bull puppy love.
buck and Crystal rob and shoot their way across the country, get married in Vegas.
because, really, who doesn't?
these are two seriously fearless individuals.
they robbed a meth lab and blew it up.
we caught Buck, and Crystal retaliated by kidnapping Megan.
Megan Reeves. This is that case?
don never talked to you about any of this?
no. - When Hoyle took Megan, Don lost it
some things happened during his interrogation with Buck.
things like...
all I know is Don got the information he needed,
buck went to the hospital, and we got Megan back.
crystal Hoyle went down shooting.
actually, she drove at our roadblock with a carload of hand grenades.
don's the one that pulled the trigger.
just another day in the exciting field of crime fighting.
why is Don acting like he did something wrong?
just, sometimes, this job forces you to ask yourself some really hard questions, and I guess that was one time Don just wasn't ready for the answers.
the kid threaten Don?
he didn't have to.
I'll take Lansky.
why don't you take McClaughlin unless, of course, you think you're gonna lose yourself in his deep brown eyes.
I thought you snuck out early to work on your lecture.
you guys remember that idea I had for finding a complex polynomial encryption?
withers just patented it.
it wasn't Withers. It was his collective.
in fact, I think a civil engineer suggested attacking it through Riemann's hypothesis.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
color me stodgy, but these attempts to manufacture insight by committee run counter to the entire history of great thought.
there are plenty of instances of great thought coming in the works of groups.
uh, Pisarro, Monet and Degas.
Wedgewood, Watt and Darwin.
oppenheimer, von Neumann, Wilson, Weisskopf.
the neo-Confucians.
okay, fine. Go ahead, pelt me with specifics.
Hey, we should start our own think tank.
you know, once a month.
anything anynyone comes up with, we all... everyone shares in.
well, I don't know why I didn't suggest that in the first place.
we could get Osaki for chemistry, Galuski for that down and dirty engineering perspective.
you know who would add a fresh dimension of thought?
who? - Your dad.
certainly.
35 years of practical experience in urban planning, but that fresh eye of the student.
Yeah. I don't think so.
so...
who wants to talk dental floss?
gray McClaughlin has a girlfriend. Deanne Drake.
Yeah, visited him 12 times in the last 18 months
and marshals are staked out at her house, tapped her phones-- no activity.
I got a work address.
figured we could go shake her up.
pier 16, huh?
and she is?
forklift driver.
McClaughlin really attracts the, uh, girlie, super-feminine types, huh?
so, how did she, uh, meet this "good-looking cat"?
prison pen pal Web site.
insert your next joke here.
Ah, no way I squander this opportunity.
I figure I'll toss a few ideas around with David, make sure we really get this one right.
you do know I'm never gonna share again.
Hey, Nikki just found a known associate of McClaughlin, so figured we'd...
Yeah, that's good.
it's 30 feet long.
floss is sold in containers of 20 to 150 yards.
I'm an informed shopper.
eyeballing the density of this rope, I'm thinking it's got to be 18, 000, maybe 19, 000 feet.
three and a half miles of dental floss, even assuming an average container size of 50 yards.
127 rolls of floss.
you guys find new and special ways to freak me out all the time.
127 rolls of floss, which is a restricted item in prisons for this exact reason.
Yeah, well, this and the fact that it's a great way to slice through someone's jugular vein.
well, I mean, we could apply a simplex algorithm.
the time it took to build a ladder based on the difficulty of access.
they had limited time to work on it, when the other prisoners and the guards weren't watching them.
and they'd have to find a way to hide the containers, throw them out.
so, some floss math tells us when they get started, so it might say something about...
where they're going-- what?
floss math.
okay, so we're talking about at least months of planning; Buck Winters-- he was all impulse.
the other two... eh, they're no masterminds, so...
don didn't...
you know, it all, it all went down last night so I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know you're up.
so...
I just saw the teletype.
Yeah, the marshals dialed us in.
all right, let's just assume the requisite stoic Don Eppes posture.
you lock up enough of these guys, sooner or later they get out.
don, this kid breaks out of jail, he makes a beeline straight towards you and he doesn't even bother to cover his tracks.
he's just another fugitive.
you know, we hunt him down and we put him back.
I hope you're just lying to me, and not to yourself.
come on.
Deanne Drake? - Yeah?
hell, no.
how about a hand, please?
punch her. - She's a girl!
girl must mean something different in Idaho.
okay, hand, please?
something to remember when that next funny remark comes in your head.
that's Glock nines, Walter P . 22, Beretta . 25,
if you're going in close, drop a silencer on this puppy, and you're like a whisper.
Dan Wesson . 357 Now, this is six shots, but what a six.
feel that metal on your hands.
whatever you want.
that's a Desert Eagle 50-caliber.
that thing's bigger than you are.
man's not lying.
that's a whole lot of gun.
that's fine.
we got a whole lot of plans.
you got nothing to hold me on.
how about a stolen Cadillac you left outside the prison?
I drive an F-150.
Deanne, come on, you watch TV.
when we find it, you so much as sneezed that car, we can DNA match a booger off the dashboard.
you really want to go down that road with us?
accessory to escape is 10 to 15, especially if you look like a bad citizen.
and so far, you don't look like a good citizen.
and look, you are not the first woman to throw away a good life on a bad man.
you put it out there, I get that.
you have to put it out there, right?
but you drew a creep.
you think I didn't know? Deep down?
I mean, he's a looker, but he's no actor.
he's got this way about him.
the way he looks at you, it just...
how'd you get the floss in?
what? - The dental floss.
he wanted a car, three changes of clothes...
wait... What? Dental floss?
she says she set the car, but she doesn't know where they are.
okay, write it up.
Hey, boss?
look, for what it's worth, I think you did what you had to do with that kid.
you know, you made some hard choices, but you were on the side of the angels.
so, has California Corrections given us more details on trash procedures?
no, I'm still waiting.
one has to admire the ingenuity at work here.
I mean, creating the unexpected out of the mundane, I mean, it's like Robinson Crusoe.
professor on Gilligan's Island.
similar circumstance.
necessity plus freedom from distraction.
Oh, I don't know, there was Mary Ann.
smart man, staying away from Ginger.
Hey, speaking of choosing one's words, have you spoken with Don?
uh, if he wants to talk about this case, he'll get around to it, you know?
how about you? How are you doing?
this must bring up some stuff.
Megan's kidnapping...
Yeah.
Ah, yet again, male communication tests the limits of Shannon's source coding theorem.
granting you that, I will inelegantly reintroduce the idea of bringing Alan into the think tank.
uh, yeah, sure...
because he and I don't spend enough time together under the same roof, or at the same school.
okay, I was seven years old, and I asked my dad if he could help me figure out a good estimate for the remainder term in a Taylor expansion of the hyperbolic cosine.
our eyes met and there was this...
tacit understanding that we had crossed the Rubicon.
when you're seven years old, your dad should be seven feet tall.
so, I separated math from my Dad.
as irrational as it sounds, I'd prefer to keep it that way.
Oh, I'm just surprised that you, uh, even have time for me.
they-- I mean, uh, what with Buck Winters on the loose.
well, you know, there's this thing called the Internet now.
they give you the news.
you don't have to worry, Dad, it's all all right.
that's a fairly ridiculous statement.
I know you're, uh, capable of taking care of yourself.
what bothers me is this, uh, strange detachment of yours.
that's what this looks like? Really?
detachment?
I'm your father, I can't help it. I just, um...
I'm, uh... scared.
look, I'm scared that if I go out there, I'm going to have to kill this kid.
eight to nine months.
that's it? No bells, no whistles?
Oh, no, I mean, I tracked the rates of floss being stolen from the infirmary, allowed for parallel escape plans, blah, blah, blah.
but ask me what's really interesting about this rope.
Charlie, what's really interesting about this rope?
boy, I'm glad you asked.
floss is generally fabricated from bundles of nylon or Teflon filaments.
it's produced in different decitexes and thicknesses.
which makes some brands stronger than others.
and sharper.
you know, you build this rope with the wrong floss, it's not going to sustain body weight, or it's gonna cut your hands.
lab had the same idea.
they didn't find any blood anywhere on the rope.
exactly. You know, all my models indicate that there was no trial and error, so, this rope wasn't built; this rope was engineered.
which requires a certain amount of aptitude.
expertise.
which is none of our three guys.
excuse me.
what's up, bro?
you don't write, you don't call.
you know how it is.
I thought David was filling you in.
Yeah, he filled us in. Dental floss.
so, we, uh, found an interesting, uh, connection.
all right, good.
FBI.
it's the shoes.
this is because I, uh, celled with Gray McClaughlin, right?
until 10 months ago, yeah.
Yeah, hit the DNA lottery.
thank LAPD for mislabeling evidence.
you can do a phone dump, toss my capacious abode.
seems like a long way down for a guy who's used to pulling six- and seven-figure takedowns.
Yeah, I guess high end burglaries don't really prepare you for the contemporary job market, do they?
it's all computers these days.
Yeah, well, you do strike us as the kind of guy that would put together a bulletproof escape plan
design a rope ladder out of dental floss.
you know who doesn't strike us that way?
you guys gonna give me some love if this is a "what if" conversation?
well, I'd say that depends on the "what if.
what if a guy is looking at 15 for a Bel Air vault he didn't blow?
spends two years figuring his way out.
as an intellectual exercise.
does this guy include his cellmate in this "intellectual exercise"?
kind of rude not to.
so, what if he finds out going home and his cellie offers him 5 G's for the plan?
Where's McClaughlin come up with five grand?
he used to deal with a guy named Nestor
Ruiz, Luiz, that's the kind of guy that might hide him out.
in this "what if" scenario.
so, how many things about that conversation didn't you like?
well, aside from cooperating before we even got in the door, confessing sideways to two felonies, then pointing us in the direction of another guy?
Yeah, aside from that.
a six-figure safecracker uh, he risks his dumb luck release for pocket money.
I think I'm still kind of stuck on that comment about my shoes.
I'm standing here hoping that a 19-year-old boy is gonna get himself stabbed in a bar fight or OD in an alley.
I once stood not far from here, wishing a similar end to the woman he loved.
because she threatened someone I cared for.
made me feel... just helpless.
I came to realize that if her actions seemed unfathomable, her motives weren't.
I don't want to know why that kid is the way that he is.
well, in cosmology, the Arrow of Time points in the direction of expansion;
and if the universe decides to contract one day...
the past is going to come looking for us whether we want it to or not?
well, cosmologists argue that the future will continue to move in the same direction.
but perhaps the universe has...
a more open mind.
I wish Pynchon would make a move already.
which apartment are we staring at?
up the stairs, hallway on the right.
hope you girls didn't have any big plans for tonight.
Nah, just this photo I got to e-mail to Idaho.
and that would be him.
Where's he going?
there's an exit up on the third floor in that middle archway.
it dumps out on Loma.
all right, got it.
think he went into another apartment.
forty.
borrowing a cup of sugar?
borrowing the landlady?
there's a window on the street. We're gonna go check it out.
first, the landlady's asking questions, then the FBI is here.
cops!
shots fired. They're coming your way.
you all right? - Yeah.
he was kind enough to break my fall.
good for him.
Eppes. - We have McClaughlin.
Yeah, keep me posted.
do you know who this is?
Yep.
then you know what I want.
from a burner cell.
untraceable, but if he calls you again, the tech boys'll try and get a triangulation.
okay, thanks.
two minute and 38 second conversation.
What'd you two fellas talk about?
about what you'd expect.
I'm trying to figure out if this is eating you up or you're being a tool.
it can't be both?
put everything else aside, okay?
you've got an office full of people who are trying to take down two escaped killers.
and it'd be pretty screwed-up if our biggest obstacle was our boss.
I'll try to stay out of your way.
how'd you get Pynchon to hide you out?
you stare at the same walls and you hear the same stories for 23 hours a day, and so I tell Pynchon about some drug stash that the cops didn't find on my last pinch.
this is when he finds out about Nestor?
there isn't a Nestor.
it's a jail story-- you know, hidden drug stash, buried pirate treasure-- same difference.
I tell you, for a smart guy, Pynchon believed what he wanted to believe. You know?
he got obsessed, started planning his way out, and then after he jackpotted that appeal, he got obsessed with me getting out and leading him to the buried treasure.
and you strung him along.
uh, him and Deanne.
is anyone really surprised by my lack of character?
and Buck and Rafe?
guys like those, you go your separate way as soon as you can.
and where's their separate way?
I have my theories.
such as?
such as... what kind of deal are we going to make?
Robin Here's your deal. Accessory after the fact.
to what?
everything-- you facilitated an escape, which means that you are culpable for every crime that I can prove as a result of that escape.
winters and Lansky-- they steal a car? It's on you.
they rob a bank? It's like you were driving the car.
they kill a federal agent?
I got good seats in the gallery, watching them cook you.
Robin Go ahead, doubt me.
put your little jailhouse law degree against mine.
and then take a look at the clock and try to figure out how many more crimes your partners are putting on your tab while you sit there and don't talk.
buck wants to kill some cop, but Rafe doesn't want to.
buck the alpha dog?
when the kid made a deal with Rafe, everybody figured that, you know, it was what it was
fish staying alive behind some muscle
but then after a while, you just, you couldn't tell anymore.
was it love, maybe something else?
so where are they?
Starline Motel.
at least that's where they were.
all I've got in my trunk is a blanket and a flashlight.
looks like, uh, you're hunting bear.
no, uh, actually, I like bears.
you know, Mr. Eppes, it's not a good time right now.
don's kind of busy.
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.
um, David...
you've known Donnie longer than anyone.
y-you know, um... I...
I, I didn't do everything right, you know.
you'll see, when you have kids, i-it's practically impossible to get everything...
right.
but I think that I-I've... - Don't worry.
I'll take care of him.
okay? - Okay.
Ah, Viterbi algorithms.
Hey, I thought you said they were for suckers.
I had this idea about predicting Buck Winters' next move.
it sort of drifted a bit.
tell me it isn't right.
have you spoken to Don about this? - No.
but I'm going to.
Hey, Sinclair, nice of you to invite us this time.
so, it's room seven.
manager's pretty sure they're still inside.
because?
he knocked on the door this morning for, quote one big-ass fight, end quote;
and Buck answered, apologized, gave him a 50 to forget about it.
their car is still parked in front of the unit.
75 Caddy, comes back stolen.
all right, so...
this unit here, bathroom window here.
Sinclair, back here!
looks like Buck broke his heart.
Hey, so, um...
there's this thing called a Viterbi algorithm.
it's a way of finding the most probable sequence of hidden states.
hidden states.
there's a guy, he does three things
he sleeps, he eats, and he hunts
and he chooses which one of those three things to do based on the season, the time of day, and the weather.
now, if we can only see this man and know what he's doing at a singular moment, frozen in time, what the Viterbi algorithm does is it tells us what the whole world looks like at that moment.
I used a similar approach with Buck Winters. I tried to predict his actions, specifically those that could be inferred by the states of "Buck hiding from the cops,
buck with a gun... - Buck trying to kill Don.
you already know where to find Buck Winters.
why didn't you call me when you found out he'd escaped?
I don't really see much math here.
five years down the road, you still don't realize that there's always math?
what the hell is wrong with you?
I didn't have a choice with Crystal.
I think about this sermon I heard the other day, this, uh...
verse they were talking about-- the natach lach.
at least the way I understood it was-- you know
what's in your hand?
what are the things that you can control?
Hey, how are you controlling the situation by shutting me out?
in perceptual terms, memory can only be increased as correlations increase. You understand?
that the Arrow of Time can only take you from the past to the future;
that what you do tonight, what you do tomorrow
it won't put the bullet back in that gun.
you ought to think about what you're about to do.
think about the regrets you'll have two years from now.
there's auto glass all over the curb out back.
looks like Buck stole another car.
well, crime techs think Rafe was cold-cocked, dragged to the bathtub, and shot there.
sure, then he climbs out the bathroom window so the manager doesn't see him;
steals a new car so he's got a head start.
recovered Winters' burner from a Dumpster four blocks away.
I think he was watching us hit his room.
he was waiting for Don.
you start a dump?
already on it. In the meantime, we pulled the last few numbers off the memory.
you gotta see this.
that's Don's cell. Why didn't he...
that number is incoming, not outgoing.
don called Buck.
the FBI switchboard...
you guys speak for two-plus minutes; you tell us, nothing but B. S.threats.
I say, okay.
you ever think to mention he gave you his phone number?
that motel lead came in, he'd have been there, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
well, here we are...
having this conversation.
you called him.
you called him out.
you scramble a five-man tac team.
you tell the marshals... - You don't get to do that.
you can't play it off like you got some kind of clear head about this.
taking the backseat, sleepwalking your way through this investigation
you know, I kind of get that.
you withheld information.
you got two choices.
you can turn me in, or you can let me lead.
what are you doing?
even on your darkest damned day, you never pulled any kind of High Noon crap like this.
listen to me.
whatever you see, whatever goes down, nobody moves until I signal.
whatever you see.
I told your father I would keep you alive.
you will not make a liar out of me.
well, the word around Cal Sci is that tomorrow's hot ticket is a lecture on time-reversible chaotic systems by Professor Charles Eppes.
right, uh...
although, I think earlier today, I may have argued against my own point with Don.
metaphorically speaking, anyhow.
I guess I'm sort of stuck on the Arrow of Time.
you know, I had a related musing.
clearly, we are circling around some underlying truth here.
don versus entropy.
Where's Maxwell's Demon when you need him?
maxwell's Demon?
Yeah, you know, the man who stands alone at the door, between two adjoining rooms.
the temperature and the pressure are the same.
it's a perfect state of equilibrium.
I've got him. SOG Bravo has the shot.
stand by. - Stand by for what?
don's calling the signals on this one.
each time the Demon opens the door, he admits only the molecules that he chooses, heating the one room and cooling the other.
it's a direct violation of the second law of thermodynamics.
SOG Charlie, we have the shot, too.
10-4. SOG Charlie. Everyone stands by for my call.
so, the Demon not only opens the door to two rooms, he allows for the possibility of perpetual motion.
should have a gun in your hands.
unless you came here to die.
and the rearranging of everything we know to be real.
I loved her.
I know you did. - You made me betray her...
and then you killed her.
SOG Bravo has a visual on the gun.
SOG Charlie-- we have a clear shot.
everyone stands by for my call.
I wake up every day and think about how I failed her.
I sold her out...
for some bruises and broken bones.
I was weak.
I had to get strong.
you did that for me. You and Rafe.
is that why you killed him?
I killed him because he was afraid to die!
you're not truly hard on the inside until you're willing to give up everything that you love!
to give your life away.
he never realized that my future wasn't his to decide.
or maybe he figured it out in the last few seconds. I don't know.
you've got three seconds to go for it.
it's not going to be that way, Buck.
Adam and Charlie, we're going in.
Bravo, hold your position.
that's 180 bullets looking at you.
you're never even gonna get that thing out of your belt.
you think I care?
two years planning this, and you let me choose the time and place?
I know you care.
you didn't come here for a fair fight.
you didn't come here to kill me.
you came here to die the same way Crystal did.
I had to kill her, Buck.
I don't have to kill you.
Why? Why can't you do this for me?
you owe me this! I'm 19 years old!
they gave me 250 years!
you don't know what that's like.
to have to pay for things that I can't take back.
I know what that's like.
that's just life.
you want to die? That's your choice.
but you don't get to decide how I live with it.
well, that's like just so much hokum, isn't it?
Hokum...
well, I mean, Maxwell's Demon is a thought experiment, right? - Yeah.
well, granted, there are theoretical applications, I'm sure, but, um, when the window breaks, the cold air still rushes in.
gears fail, oil leaks.
sooner or later, that engine is gonna break down.
I know that wasn't easy.
you know, most days, I wouldn't think twice.
no. Not easy.
Hey, Dad, a bunch of us at Cal Sci were talking about putting together a think tank, which is, you know, just a group of us getting together once a month and kicking around ideas, and...
we were wondering if you might be interested in joining our group.
you know, I still remember the time when you asked me for, um, an estimate on the remainder term for a Taylor expansion of the hyperbolic cosine.
Amita That's a very specific memory, Alan.
one never forgets the moments when one realizes that he has nothing left to teach his seven-year-old son about math.
well, yeah, but...
look at everything else you've taught me about since then.
I think you've just given me another very specific memory.
to our new venture.
and to the causal Arrow of Time.
within the small sphere of our life, we can stare into the past, but only our future is within our control.
don't move.
hands in the air and face the wall.
hands in the air and face the wall.
browner Dunn, diplomatic security. Thank you for responding.
don Eppes.
looks like you got it covered.
rooftop entry, cked security?
and it sounds like a high tech b and e.
the Brazilian consulate has two Andrades, a Portinaris,
and a diamond collection that rivals Debeers.
none of it was touched.
your guy probably scared 'em off. Where's he at?
Yuson -- He was gone when we got here.
he hasn't checked in 90 minutes.
any chance he was in on it?
not likely.
the guy's a boy scout.
they took out the main cameras.
whoever it is, they have a blueprint on how to beat a biometric security system.
but not an attention to detail.
I checked with the neighbors.
their garage camera covers the hall window.
that's Yuson.
there's more.
all right, so where is he?
according to the footage, this is the only place they could have gone.
they couldn't have made Yuson disappear.
this painting is speaking to me.
listen.
Hey, does this thing move?
how'd you...?
worked for batman.
looks like a voice recognition trigger lock.
the fasr. Quantico's been testing this thing.
the lock responds to voice passphrases from the owner.
consul Nespola's been in Brazil, visiting his son.
we haven't been able to reach him.
there's probably not much air, right?
what about the vault designer?
no, that wouldn't help; you need Nespola's voice.
I'll call LAFD, have them drill it open.
reinforced steel versus a drill? Drill loses.
you think we can pick it?
you know, we don't need Nespola's vocal chords to get his voice 'cause he's a public figure.
I've got 27, 521 views on YouTube.
I... Love... rum-Pel-Stilt-Skin.
that's an ocean of clips, Charlie.
how do we narrow that down to a passphrase?
I'm using a wavelet analysis to supersmooth the rapid word combinations.
the English language has 44 phonemes, which are sounds inherent in human speech,
and that's what voice recognition is based on.
it keys on the sounds within words instead of the words themselves?
and all we need the right combination within those 44.
God... honor... country... football.
it's like walking into a junkyard...
and you're surrounded by dozens of cars that no longer run,
so you start collecting parts
carburetors, radiators, pistons, transmissions.
you clean 'em off, you see which parts still function, you put 'em together,
mixing and matching until you find a combination that runs.
Goody... Good-Y... two... shoes.
Yeah, You got it.
Oh, my god.
you all right?
Dunn I'm gonna take this off...
let me get this straight. You pass up paintings and diamonds for...
sneakers?
all right, I can understand stealing gold, stealing art,
but who pulls a heist for shoes?
who keeps 'em in a vault?
this consul Nespola dude's got to be a hard-core shoe collector.
look, I know guys who stand in line for days for a pair of kicks.
you're kidding me -- For shoes?
aren't you the guy with, like, 35, 000 comic books?
he's got dead stock waffles, Micropacers, So-Cal exclusives.
a collection like this has got to be worth millions.
look, kicks are status symbols. All right?
you live in Malibu, you drive a Maserati.
you live on Slauson, you wear Jordans.
how do you know so much About it?
I got a four-year degree from the streets of Compton and Watts.
Yeah, but they stole one pair.
judging from what they left behind, they're something special.
all right, well, thieves are not complicated, right?
I mean somebody hired them or the shoes are headed for the black market.
Yeah, either way, we got about 24 hours before the sneakers get mod.
consul Nespola's here.
all the guy talks about is shoes.
these right here
vintage brazilian adidas.
paid $300 for 'em, sold 'em for $5, 000.
it's the new stock market.
oil -- Unreliable, real estate -- In the toilet.
but in shoes you trust?
listen, I go after big paydays
made my fortune in junk bonds -- But before I was consul,
I was a kid who couldn't afford sneakers,
and now I can, so I do.
you got a picture of the ones that were stolen, by any chance?
picture of every pair.
okay,
these are the 2-K primers.
Oh, yeah, I know primers.
my brother wanted a pair when we were kids.
parents paid rent instead.
what's so special about these?
what's so...? Give me that.
this is the very first pair of the final edition primers off the assembly line -- Serial number 001.
that means I paid $250, 000 for these at auction.
do you have any idea what they're going to be worth in five years?
no, and I don't really care, but I do notice that you bought most of them in the last year. Is that true?
well, what I lack in experience, I make up for in aggressiveness.
well, that can't make the other collectors happy.
Oh, the other collectors can kiss my converse because no one was supposed to know I had these primers.
that auction was allegedly closed.
who was in charge of the sale?
la-la Buendia -- Works for 2-K shoes.
Hey, congratulations on that promotion.
Yeah, supervisor of organized crime.
I head to denver at the end of the week.
Yeah, it's cold there.
it's a great department.
yeah? -- Great opportunity.
all right.
so, stealing shoes has young and dumb written all over it,
but your thieves manipulated voice recognition.
so maybe someone shares their mo?
Yeah, why don't you run it by Charlie?
find a heuristic that'll cut down the time?
I don't know, maybe you have been here too long.
who knew that shoes could bring the world together?
just do not step on anyone's feet.
what's up?
Hey, if you're here for the primer bracelets, y'all need to get in line.
you don't let us inside, you're gonna be the one wearing bracelets.
what do the bracelets get you?
final edition primers drop on the general public in a week.
everybody and their moms is trying to cop.
once the first pair auctioned off for crazy money,
I guess the demand for these went through the roof.
these priority bracelets -- They keep people from mobbing each other on the day of release?
Yeah.
I mean, it only raises the hype, though, you know.
you want a discount, yo, I can hook it up.
sorry I'm late.
that's okay.
Amita had a combinatorics symposium in kansas city.
I had a lecture on synchronized chaos, which is not at all meant for one person.
what's the required reading?
well, I checked with our audio guys in virginia,
and the banks have been using voice recognition technology for the past few years.
it looks like an imposing list of suspects if we're simply considering bank heists.
you know? -- Epic.
Yeah, well, an epic search calls for an epic search algorithm.
it'll, uh, it'll sort suspects into segments.
so, Ms. Buendia, you were running the auction for 2-K shoes,
and Nespola said no one was supposed to know the identity of the winning bidder.
look, this was an auction for the first pair of the final edition primers.
word was gonna get out, regardless.
Plus, who cares? Nespola's a jerk.
any idea who stole his shoes?
every head in l. A. wants that heat.
me? I'm on your side
I don't get paid until they're found.
what do you mean?
well, Nespola froze his auction payment until the shoes are found.
that means no commission for me.
on a quarter million dollar sale, you do the math.
thing about Nespola winning the auction is that everyone else lost.
leaves a lot of angry bidders.
well, biing did get hot and heavy between Nespola and Bit o" nutz.
who?
DJ Bit o' nutz.
the only sneakerhead with a collection bigger than Nespola's.
Oh, right there, right there, right there.
Yeah, girl. Go a little lower -- That's right.
daddy got a lot of stress down there, girl.
come on, man. This is not what I call a happy ending.
we'd like to talk to you for a few minutes.
what's up, Buster Brown?
well, you know, they say kicks say a lot about a man, and, uh, those are screaming,"supercop!"
so, you're Vic Moritz? Is that right?
I prefer...
bit o" nutz.
hit single.
what's nuts is you bidding six figures on a pair of shoes.
man, you can't argue with that.
that's love.
look, I know everything there is to know about primers.
it all started with primer nelson.
busted ankle ended his playing days in the league,
so he made kicks to prevent injuries to others.
you mix tech with fashion, and...
primers became a phenomenon.
vic, we didn't really come here for a history lesson.
Yeah, but it's who I am, baby.
I mean, I produced my first single to buy a pair of primers.
so, you must have been ticked off when Nespola got the final editions.
Hey, man, I'm not going to lie.
I mean, those kicks are my grails,
but I don't need to steal from a reseller like Nespola.
mind if we take a look in here?
fine... excuse me.
Hey, go ahead, toss my crib if you want.
I ain't got nothing to hide.
you are not gonna find any final edition primers here.
so, is that why you sent threatening e-mails to Nespola and la-La Buendia?
look, man, I felt cheated, so I sent a message.
look, as you can see, I am more intimidating in an e-mail than I am in person.
it's not about the money for me.
Oh, no? -- No.
they say love ... is putting on a fresh pair every day.
that's me.
I mean, ask around, man. I mean, my reputation is nice.
I can't say that for Nespola.
so, looks like we to dueling lists of 12 suspects here,
than to the power of efficiency through optimized searching.
I'm sorry, I'm kind of nerding out on you.
Oh, no, I was just, uh...
I was having one of those reflective moments.
Hey, Denver is lucky to have you.
that's... that's what they say, right?
it is a great opportunity.
it's a promotion.
urban nomads are the last great adventurers.
you know, I was just a kid when I got to Princeton.
Charlie, when you graduated from Princeton, you were just a kid.
no, what I'm saying is, is that you really never learn more about yourself than when you'ren your own, when you're away from family.
that's true.
not everyone has a family like that.
I'm just saying, I don't even wear Buster Browns, you know?
does it matter?
no, but you know how much I paid for these?
how you doing? -- What's up?
this is David Sinclair.
nice to meet you.
I saw your name on the alerts for that consulate heist.
come on, check this out.
guy runs through here.
he gets this.
all right, but how does that connect to us?
you wear 250 g's on your feet in skid row, you're looking to get jacked.
for one shoe
our cinderfella has no ID but prison tats.
the techs think Eastern European.
all right, run his photo, get it to immigration.
any description of the shooter?
witnesses say a white guy in his 20s.
he argued with our dead guy before chasing him down here.
literally chased him out of his shoe.
thought breaking a heel was bad.
first thing our killer did was go for the shoe, but a crowd of looky-loos,
they scared him off before he got to it.
chased away by the bum brigade?
and he dropped his gun.
forensics is working on print??
they can't find the other shoe?
on this street, shiny new things tend to disappear quickly.
Yeah, Betancourt.
okay.
Yeah, great.
Yeah, that was Liz and Charlie.
they think they found a possible match on the mo from our consulate heist.
I can't wait to meet the guy that hacks voice recognition locks for a living.
Interpol says his name is Stephanois.
he's french, too.
your rap sheet reads like an encyclopedia for thieves.
and... I made a fortune.
alas, all good things come to an end.
then again, a rendezvous with two charming damsels...
always a pleasure.
Yeah, you know what really makes us hot?
stories about biometric security.
I pulled diamond heists in Paris, art in Monaco...
Yeah, but see, that's the thing about heists.
sooner or later, you get caught.
which is why I embrace the peace and quiet of retirement.
Interpol says you adjusted your game.
internet theft, hacking speech recognition locks on bank computers.
taking the life savings of soccer moms was a tad banal.
is that why you switched it up again?
you know, lifting sneakers from Randall Nespola.
last night, I was having dinner with my parole officer.
steak was overcooked.
and I would never soil my craft heisng something as trivial...
as tennis shoes.
six figure shoes aren't so trivial.
low six or high six?
you buy it?
well, let's see.
extremely rare skill set, lifelong criminal.
maybe there's a connection to Mr. One Shoe.
I'll check.
you want to see if anyone tried to fence the shoes to other bidders?
Yeah, sure.
I heard you're leaving me to fend for myself in the boys club.
Yeah.
that's good for you. Ss of your own unit.
but you'll be missed around here.
thanks...
and I think you're doing all right in the boys club.
Nah, girl, I'm just trying to be like you.
did you ever notice how professor Elliot resembles a cobra?
psoriasis, hoodlike neck, bites when angry.
Yeah, okay, I can see it.
you were late to solid state physics lab again?
by three minutes -- I mean, he locks the doors.
I'll never get my lab hours at this rate.
you know, Charles, there are other labs that would fulfill your dad's requirement.
Oh, yeah. Computation and neural systems, for example.
exactly. -- Fine, fine. As long as your professor
you're looking at them.
you... you...
Ah, there he is.
how's the great sneaker caper?
well, the good news is we found the right one.
Congrats.
but the left one was lost, apparently somewhere in skid row.
all right, so...
we're talking about an item that's been misplaced in an area where its value has yet to be determined, so...
you know what, get us a layout of the crime scene,
and we can run an a priori probability distribution search, which won't tell you where the shoe was picked up,
but it will give you search zones.
well, that sounds like a lot of work for sneakers.
just give me a pair of bubbas.
I'm not familiar with that brand.
they're a reference to a variety of generic brands... like, cheap sneakers.
great for a fifth grader, quantity-wise. Not so great aesthetically.
right -- Hence my having to wear golf shoes folittle league.
Hey, hey, hey. You were lucky you didn't go barefoot.
you know, in an area like skid row,
where no one knows the difference between bubbas and primers,
the preference for shoes balances between need and aesthetic value.
sounds like "shipwrecks and sneakers."
what's that? -- It's a true story.
the vessel hansa was en route from korea to portland,
when it lost all these crates of sneakers overboard.
Yeah, yeah, I read about that.
Yeah, they wound up on shores from Oregon to Hawaii in a pattern, depending on what the brands were or whether they were rights or lefts.
and scientists used the flow pattern
to trace the shoes back the spill site.
is this gonna get us anywhere, or are we just digressing?
when do I ever digress?
Thanks.
Hey, thanks for making the time.
we need to know if either of these faces look familiar.
maybe one of them sniffed around, trying to get contact info off of one of the auction bidders.
never seen either one.
look, yesterday, maybe I came off wrong.
the thing is, that commission is my seed money.
future site of my company, once I leave 2-K shoes.
Oh, man, I haven't seen anything in here since TJ's drug store cleared out.
I used to patrol the area.
well, It'd be nice to bring business back.
you know, give some people jobs.
make some affordable, hot kicks.
affordable and hot?
that's not an easy combination.
Yeah.
but it's more fulfilling than selling shoes that nobody wears.
Yeah, I got you.
so, no one approached you about any of the bidders?
no.
but I did get a call after the auction about the bid amounts.
the guy didn't leave his name and I didn't give any numbers.
la-la gets a call about the bid amounts,
probably gauging a market value for fencing the shoes.
so we did a dump on la-La's phone.
and we traced a call to a guy who matches the description of our skid row shooter.
lee Diddums. Popped for a gta. Liquor store holdups before that.
and Johnny Knoxville stays busy.
Oh, come on. He's minor league.
Yeah, that's what I thought, until I looked at his earlier jobs.
internet theft -- Using audio files?
he was juvie at the time. That's why he wasn't in our records.
and during his time in juvie he had a visitor.
Diddums is his kid?
no, his nephew.
mother's maiden name is Stephanois.
that apple fell far from the tree and rolled down the hill.
all right, put an APB on him.
and let's interview Stephanois again.
ice id'd our dead guy. He's Ekin Zetroc.
he's Albanian, in the country illegally. I have an address.
I am going inside! -- You have no busiss being here.
no, they're mine! Yeah, say that again! Say at again! -- And look who shows up at the dead albanian's house.
no, no, get out of my life!
what am I, your woman now?
if you're taking bets, I got to go with Nespola.
get back in your little car and go home, my man.
we got the same car!
I don't know. Bit o" nutz could surprise.
you couldn't hide behind why am I talking to you? Your emails? Yeah.
you know why they call me nutz? 'Cause I'm about to go loco on you right now.
Hey, hey save it for the octagon...
is that right?
aren't your bank rolls a little too large to be duking it out on the street?
I got a call from some guy in there.
he's offering to sell my primers, back to me.
Yeah, and I got the same call, but no one showed.
it's hard to show when you dead?? All right.
looks like our Albanian was trying to set up a bidding war.
what's that? -- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's that you find my primers?
we're halfway there. Okay?
listen, you spend that much on shoes, they should stay on your feet.
he wore them?! -- He wore em?!
that ruins the value! -- That ruins the value!
things are looking worse for Diddums.
forensics came back on the gun.
he killed our skid row stiff, Zetroc.
Yeah. Anything with the APB?
no, nothing yet.
we combed Zetroc's place.
nothing there but Albanian junk, so we grabbed his cell phone records.
traced the calls he made to Nespola and Moritz.
and according to our interface, came from a warehouse on skid row.
all right, get on it.
FBI! Don't move!
Hey!
get back here!
Hey!
hold it! Don't! Don't!
nice jump.
gotta be the shoes.
Yeah, but which one is?
Diddums tied them up.
left 'em in a backroom.
stylish crew. I thought general release wasn't until next week.
Hey, why wait when you can make your own?
counterfeiters.
use a mold from an authentic pair to make knockoffs.
so, everyone here's Albanian, same as our dead friend, Zetroc.
any idea what Diddums was searching for?
no. No one knows, but they've seen him before.
he met with their bosses.
bosses?
and that guy...Nadroj Ria.
I didn't know Zetroc.
Really?
you know Albanian, right?
nice labor camps.
Immigration'll make sure you meet up with your old friends.
I'd rather do prison here than go back there.
all right, start talking.
Diddums stole a pair of final edition primers from some rich guy.
we paid 20, 000 him to borrow the shoes for a few hours...
make molds, take pictures.
we can knock out 100 counterfeits in a day.
but the other part -- That was Zetroc's idea.
the other part?
switch the shoes on Diddums, give him couerfeits.
because, naturally, one good theft deserves another.
Zetroc said he could auction off the real pair.
but Diddums killed him first.
so, what was Diddums doing at the warehouse when we arrived?
the primers Zetroc was wearing were knockoffs, too.
now he was going back for the real ones.
we mighte crooks, but we're not stupid.
so where are the originals?
your-your nephew's a killer.
lee can barely wipe his backside without screwing up,
much less commit murder.
you didn't tell us pulling heists was a family business.
my nephew is on the shallow end of the gene pool.
how about laying low, you teach him that?
is there anything in my history that suggests this kind of buffoonery?
I once owned a place in Tahiti.
had I made that score,
I'd be there right now, surrounded with beauties.
well, you can think about that.
call me crazy, but I believe him.
so we find the damn primers, we'll catch him.
gotta hand it to him.
not easy to find a needle in a needle stack.
Yeah, especially when the only guy who knows which is which is dead.
man, I know everything about these kicks, and I can't tell the difference.
that's funny. Considering a real one costs ten times as much.
Yeah, tried weighing 'em.
every sneaker's the same 15 ounces.
all right, hot off the prices.
the results from my skid row distribution search.
although now I'm thinking that this information is obsolete.
and a new problem, one of theses is the authentic pair.
Really?
you could compare material bases using a cross-dissection.
uh, is he suggesting we cut open a pair of final edition primers?
buoyancy, then.
if these counterfeits are made from a mold, than a buoyant force acting on a counterfeit would be different from a buoyant force acting on an authentic pair.
buoyancy means water, right?
not on hand-stitched tumbled leather.
Charlie, is there a way to do it without destroying a pair the shoes?
there is.
I would need an authentic pair of primers.
you know what? I need more sneakers.
Where's the assistant?
sorry.
thought I might have slipped a disc back there.
you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
I can't believe
this the way you treat all your lab assistants?
no.
actually, they spend a week of horticultal boot camp at the Eppes house.
I see. That's who cuts our lawn?
I'll be back.
Hey. -- Hey.
nice shades.
thank you.
who puts the coppertone on who first?
actually, this machine has no impact on skin pigmentation.
Yeah, hyperspectral imaging just simply collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum.
how's it do that?
seeing all ranges of light, from the visible to the ultraviolet.
in much the same manner as a mantis shrimp.
who curiously are neither mantis nor shrimp.
they just look alike.
these guys that are going to help us?
okay.
it's a little bit like this stress ball.
now, it may resemble the far heavier paperweight,
but they have different core properties.
what are you doing?
I just thought you were gonna catch it.
the hyperspectral sensors collect information as a set of images.
and then that information is combined to form a 3-D picture
which reveals the objects true properties.
And...By testing these warehouse shoes along with the authentic primers, the hyperspectral will tell us which of these pairs is identical to the authentic pair.
sneakers and shrimp with X-ray vision,
I remember when zippers on kicks were cutting-edge technology.
you talking about kangaroos?
I had a pair of roos in the second grade. Wore them everywhere.
I used to keep quarters in the zipper pockets.
for the ice cream man? -- Yep.
man, the sneaker game.
some call it a subculture, but I think it's about back in the day memories.
nothing better than somebody asking, where'd you get those?
right?
in a neighborhood full of after thoughts,
dope pair of kicks made a kid feel good about herself.
well, it's been relayed through the ether that your time with us may be short.
FBI made me an offer that I...
I just couldn't refuse.
I congratulate and commend you.
decisions that take us away from family... those are, those are...
well, they're not easy ones.
it's not that hard.
older brother's busy with the state department.
younger brother's in prison, and father died years ago.
if I turned down a promotion like this, I don't get another shot for three years.
well, new opportunities sometimes require just kind of leaving others behind.
and in my case, I found my new family.
the people I work with, laugh with, think with.
so, I suppose I found my reason to stay.
none of these shoes are authentic.
and yet, they still manage to keep your feet from getting dirty.
Oh, look at that. Size 12.
you don't start talking soon, you're on your way back to sh-koder.
Diddums has the primers.
when he came back to the warehouse for the real pair,
he put a gun in my face,
so I told him where to find the shoes.
why didn't you tell us this to begin with?
I figured I could make bail, hunt down Diddums myself.
win, win.
take the shoes or his money.
hunt him down where?
get down!
I got Diddums!
you, down!
hands behind your back. Spread your legs.
got my running shoes on today.
nice. Where are the primers?
primers what?
that's a lot of cash you got there.
found it under my pillow.
he's erased his call history.
Hey, don't bother checking the sim chip, either.
I torched that, too.
you uncle teach you how to do that?
take a look at this.
nice!
now, why would Vic Moritz give you his number?
better question.
why didn't anybody teach you not to write on your hand?
come on, genius. This way.
yo, where have you been?
I've been calling all day. I've been going crazy.
get your hands behind your back. -- What?
crazy to hire thieves to steal from Randall Nespola.
Oh, okay, okay, listen. I mean, maybe we can work something out.
uh, you know, you like autographed cds or something?
where are the sneakers?
I don't know, man. I wish I could tell you.
you know, I hear in jail, the term Bit o" nutz has a whole different meaning.
wait, wait. You are not hearing me.
look, I had the primers, as in past tense.
unbelievable.
think you don't believe this?
imagine waking up to this.
I usually chase people in sneakers, not the sneakers themselves.
what's it called when deja vu is real?
it's called we missed something.
Diddums is in custody, we searched his place, no shoes.
moritz could have hidden his collection somewhere else.
let's go with what we have.
techs say that a torch was used to open the vault.
now, they also found a point of entry -- Broken window in the garage.
a straight forward smash-and-grab.
for an entire vault of shoes?
well, maybe the thief knows how to fence sneakers.
or he's trying to throw us off.
the real prize here is the primers.
who knew about the primers and has the ability to pull off big heists?
doesn't seem like Stephanois' style.
but he is getting old, and he's in a hurry.
ticket to Tahiti.
Stephanois is in the wind,
so I figured 24 hours tops to move the shoes.
you know, I can't help but relate this conundrum to shipwrecks and sneakers.
okay, what's that?
well, it could work as a method of telegraphing.
we reverse the focus.
we use the element we know to predict where the shoes will float to.
right. For David it works.
well, what do we know?
the market value of the shoes,
and the sneaker heads who might be interested in them.
right. And the telegraph process links these two factors,
and measures risk versus reward.
it give us a third factor -- The most likely buyer.
I mean, we all play pinball.
think of the primers as a pinball.
now, the number of buyers is already limited.
the level of risk involved with purchasing the shoes
tells us where the bumpers are.
now, the primers are extremely high-priced.
they're high-profiled.
they're high-risk considering they're stolen property.
so, the number of possible avenues, of possible buyers, considering all factors, becomes extremely limited.
in fact, the buyer with the least risk and the greatest ability to purchase is the same person that we might least suspect.
the original owner.
all right, hold it.
hands behind the back. You know the drill.
I suppose TahitI will have to wait, huh?
but you'll always have paris, right?
must have just sold the shoes.
got your call, Eppes.
didn't believe it until Stephanois showed up.
Where's Nespola?
inside.
technically, he's on foreign soil, so he's got diplomatic immunity.
Yeah, he may have immunity, but the shoes don't.
they're my primers!
they're stolen, and they're evidence in a murder case.
you know, I'm foreign consul.
I don't, uh... I don't have to cooperate with the FBI.
Yeah, you're right.
but the primers are coming with us, which means they'll be in evidence.
you never know how long that can take.
who knows how the sneakers will be treated once they get there?
man, some of the stories I heard about evidence.
Oh, yeah, I've heard some...
okay, if I cooperate,
you promise you're gonna take care of the primers?
you gonna make your auction payment?
look, no scuff marks on the shoes, okay?
listen, whoever is in evidence, please, you got to make sure that they know what they're doing.
you cannot put them in direct sunlight.
just give us the damn shoes, huh?
so, anyway, I just put it in a box inside th...
closet? Really?
Yeah, well, my vault's voice recognition won't be reconfigured for another week, okay?
so, until then...
Oh, no.
come on.
I just put them there.
Oh, here we go again.
that sounds like...
dad, I saw you hide these, but they're so cool!
best birthday ever!
these are for me, right?
let's say, uh, give your dad a second, okay?
show him what you got. Let's d. Little bit of d.
get up.
hand-stitched leather, candy-painted chassis,
carbon fiber steel shank plates in each sole.
and a smile on your kid's face.
buy the shoes for him.
Yeah, look at how much fun he's having.
I got you ??
just put it on the table.
Hey, hey.
you got a name for your company?
not yet.
I don't think Phil Knight came up with nike till he got his first shoe.
Nespola made his auction payment.
here's your commison check.
Yeah, he was in a generous mood.
that's cool.
good looking out.
now, you can quit your job.
you know, do this thing for real.
you know I'll bring the heat.
okay, I just got one request.
what's that?
can you make me a pair with zippers on the side?
sure.
Liz said she'd call us when she lands in Denver.
well, anything for me?
uh, no. Sorry. This is... actually, it's all me.
so check it out. John Maeda
he's a professor at MIT
he, uh... he designed a pair of kicks based on his own algorithms, so I thought I'd do the same.
check these out. What do you think?
hidden markov model on the toe.
uh, some hermetian random matrixes on the tongue.
and, uh, social network analysis throughout.
air geeks.
okay, dinner is almost ready.
tonight, you all have the honor of having, goulash.
hungarian for whatever's in the fridge.
what's up? You had bad day at the lab or something?
Yeah, that's, uh, very funny.
now just keep on laughing.
think I'm gonna change my will.
Oh. On my way over, look who I found.
aren't you supposed to be on a plane?
I was.
and then I looked at my boots.
I've, uh... I've had these boots for seven years.
I've worn them into the ground.
I've replaced the heels, the zippers.
but I'd never give them up.
so, if I can't let go of a pair of boots, then...
...why the hell would I ever let go of a great situation like this?
a great job doesn't compares to a great life.
you guys are family.
well said.
Oh. Wait a minute.
did you just compare us to a pair of old boots?
I did.
how do you know we were even gonna take you back?
Yeah. Well... just sit down.
speaking of old boots, let's eat some goulash.
definitely changing my will, definitely.
so these are some examples of what we might find today in our catch.
pacific crab, sea anemones, any number of a variety of starfish, we'll find sea urchin, along with a host of sardines and mackerel.
now, when I release this net over here,
I want you to try to identify as many creatures as you can.
keep a list in your notebooks, now.
so far, most of what we can see here is kelp, which you're all familiar with from the beach, right?
everybody's seen that?
good. So write down "kelp.
somebody call the Harbor Patrol!
Hey, boys.
how is it this guy rates FBI attention?
he has the dumb luck of getting himself scooped up out of the ocean.
crimes at sea puts it on our desk.
he wasn't in the water long.
16 to 24 hours.
I can't say for sure till I get him in the shop, but he was probably dead before he went in.
think the bullet hole in his wetsuit had anything to do with that?
actually, Granger, it's the bullet hole in the diver that really clinched it. Thank you.
glad to see those four years of med school didn't go to waste on you.
five.
so where'd you find it?
the boat was dragging the net over several miles, seeing what they could pull up for the kids. Kids?
junior high class on an oceanography field trip.
that must have gone over real well.
and it's not a regular wetsuit here, right?
no, it's definitely commercial.
he's an oil rig diver or something?
check it out.
Morris Marine Salvage.
salvage diver.
guy makes a living bringing stuff up off the bottom of the ocean, winds up somebody else's catch.
Hey, Charlie.
Hey.
you headed for school?
no, actually.
I'm headed to the FBI to drop off some crime index work I did.
but after that, yeah, I am.
Ah, you're looking for a match, huh?
with you? You crazy?
said I'd never do that again.
sit around watching you getting bored with me all the time?
or condescending.
or bored and condescending.
well...
thought maybe you were desperate.
you know, seeing as your usual chess partner Larry is currently in low earth orbit.
no, not at all.
you know, Millie says she has a pretty good game.
Oh, really? Well, then, I'll be sure to teach her some of my best condescending looks. No.
I mean, no coaching.
she says she has a pretty good game, you let her bring her game.
dad, she's a mathematician.
that gives her the same analytical edge that I have.
Yeah, I hadn't thought about that.
Yeah.
maybe I'd better think about changing some of my strategy.
maybe you take this whole thing a little too seriously.
Charlie, it's chess.
need I say more?
what's up?
Hey. So you want to know the dead guy's name?
Yeah.
he was a Navy diver till '98.
he's been working a bunch of dive jobs since.
and five months ago, he landed Morris Marine Salvage.
but he really should have done a little more homework on his employer.
Why's that?
meet the Morris brothers,
Chris and Robert.
Yeah, what are they into?
theft, assault.
but I'm kind of getting the feeling all the marine salvage people are not Boy Scouts.
right.
been on the phone with a bunch of salvage companies in the area, turns out every single dive team between here and San Diego are out looking for the same thing
the Cheetah.
yeah?
a 60-foot Open Class racing yacht went down a couple days ago.
at 40 miles out in deep water.
think I read about this, right?
they're in some round the world race?
what, they still can't find it?
Yeah, they were headed for Marina del Rey when she sank, and the skipper went down with her.
Charlie, are you a closet yachtsman or just really up on the news? Neither.
open Class is the term for the cutting edge of racing yachts, and a ton of math goes into designing them.
a lot of it is based on my work in computational fluid dynamics.
fluid dynamicsis aerodynamics in the water?
you can think of air as a very thin liquid.
both air and water stick to surfaces as they travel over them, creating friction.
what we can do is to create mathematically optimized designs that reduce friction, lowering the drag as air, or in this case water, moves around the design.
the lower the drag, the faster the boat.
how much you know about this particular one? Not much.
designs are kept secret before a race.
what I can tell you is that these boats can easily cost $8 to $10 million.
and a boat like the Cheetah, even as a shipwreck, is still worth a couple million.
that would explain why everybody's out looking for it.
Yeah, I mean, as far as maritime law's concerned, you find it, you own it.
basically, we got a big treasure hunt.
somewhere out there, on the bottom of the ocean, is a $2 million prize.
excuse me.
how you doing?
we're with the FBI.
anyone from Morris Salvage around?
I haven't seen anybody today, no.
when was the last time you saw them?
I don't know. Uh, that's their boat.
it's been out past couple of days.
must have come back in last night.
but I wasn't here, so...
what's your name? Jackson.
okay, Jackson, thanks.
Yeah.
if this guy's right, that means this barge was out the same time period the diver was shot and dumped. Uh-huh.
ever see Treasure of the Sierra Madre?
guys are out looking for treasure, they start getting greedy.
mix in a little alcohol, maybe an argument erupts over how they're gonna split up the prize when they find it. Yeah.
three guys sail out, maybe only two make it back.
Hey, Colby.
come here, check it out.
Yeah, that's probably not finger paint, huh?
maybe better call in and get a team out here.
hold on, I'll be back in a sec.
agent Warner.
how you doing?
what do you say, kid?
what's going on?
I got transferred.
l. A.'s my new base.
no way.
Yeah, I've been here about three weeks.
I just got caught up in the work.
you know how that is.
Yeah, definitely, sure.
I caught wind of your case, gave me an excuse to see you.
Oh, yeah? All right.
I'm working a task force looking at the marina as an entrance point for drugs.
we've been seeing supply boats come up from Mexico and making drops in deep water.
and local fishing charters or salvage boats go out, make the pickup.
was hoping I can tag along with you guys, see if there's any connection between that and this.
Yeah, sure.
tag away.
all right.
Hey, uh,
ERT guys are on their way.
how you doing, Agent Warner?
good to see you.
check out this picture I found up in the wheelhouse.
cheetah.
Morris Salvage isn't part of the official search for the Cheetah, but that doesn't mean they weren't out there looking.
situation like this, salvagers descend like flies, everybody's looking to grab a piece of the rights to...
whatever's down there.
well, that must be annoying.
it's your yacht and everybody's looking to cash in.
right now, the more boats out there, the merrier.
gives us a better chance of finding Reid.
Reid Sarasin, your skipper?
I was in radio contact with him until he went down.
not a handful of people in the world could sail on his level.
you have any idea what caused your yacht to sink, then?
probably design flaw.
we fared well, most of the race, but then, three days out of Honolulu, the keel starts to separate, and she begins taking on water.
so why didn't they turn back then?
the seas got rougher, we realized how serious it was, and Reid gave the order to abandon ship.
and how many in his crew?
five, including Reid.
we were able to contact another yacht, she doubled back, picked up four of our guys, but Reid wouldn't go.
he thought, with four less bodies on board, the Cheetah could make it.
but he didn't.
seven minutes later, we lost radio contact.
then her locator beacon went dead.
I can replace the Cheetah, you know?
can always build another boat.
but I'm not sure how I'm gonna replace Reid Sarasin.
Charlie. Charlie. Sorry.
quick question for you.
how good is your dad at chess?
he's good.
he'll give you a real game.
Uh-oh.
I'm afraid I might have misrepresented my abilities just a little bit.
you don't play chess? No, I do.
I mean, I can. It's a game.
I'm good at games.
there's, like, what, there's queen and the crown?
Oh, boy. Doesn't matter.
alan will probably enjoy being able to teach me something.
what's this?
what, now you're building a boat on university time?
these are design plans for a racing yacht that came apart and sank.
Oh.
and you're looking for the flaws.
I am. But I haven't found any yet.
as far as I can tell, the design is solid.
with the allotted load of crew and supplies, well, I see no reason why the keel failed.
you know, Charlie, I have some sailing experience myself.
well, no, no.
for real. Not like my chess experience.
real experience. I bet you're gonna tell me about it.
Yes, I am.
I took a three-month sabbatical from M. I.T. and I spent it navigating the South Pacific with a friend from grad school.
now, I know it sounds like
I'm in danger of not having a point here, but I do, and it's this:
out at sea, all bets are off.
you encounter forces that you could never, ever anticipate.
granted, some of those forces have to do with, you know, being confined to a very small space with someone who you thought you knew but clearly didn't, someone who is so enamored with the sound of their own voice that they could just talk endlessly for hours and hours without ever needing to even have to take...
I mean, you don't know what it's like. You said you had a point.
and I do.
professor, it's this:
the ocean has to have exerted tremendous physical pressure on this boat.
I mean, have you accounted for tensile stress, for compressive creep, for material fatigue here?
well, I ran calculations...
...to evaluate probabilities for material failures, to see if the design would withstand ocean conditions.
and I'll tell you, I cannot find a single flaw.
well, then why'd the yacht sink?
Colby, you're gonna want to hear this, too.
that was the lab.
they just finished the preliminary analysis on the blood you found on the Morris barge. Uh-huh.
they isolated three distinct samples.
the first one belongs to our deceased diver,
Koontz, and the other two...
what, the brothers? Yeah.
the blood-types are consistent.
so the Morris brothers become potential victims now, not suspects?
which means we shift our focus where?
other salvage companies maybe?
somebody who was trying to stop the Morris barge from finding anything out?
?or one of the drug orgnizations, I was telling Don about.
right. Either they're involved or the search for the yacht took them too close to something they weren't supposed to see.
it's safe to say the guy was shot on the barge.
right? It's just a question of where it was at the time.
if we knew where the barge was, we would know what other ships were in the area, who else had access.
I gotta tell ya, from a mathematical standpoint, the designs for this yacht are absolutely amazing.
I mean, it almost has me thinking about getting back into my fluid dynamics work again.
Ooh, you mean abandon your cognitive emergence theory?
is that what you're talking about? I said "almost."
Oh, good, because I remember the damage that some of those, uh, fluid dynamics experiments did on the pond in the backyard.
all the koi lived.
Hey.
Donny. Dinner's over, Hey.
but we have some leftovers, you interested?
Oh, no. I'm good, I ate. Thanks.
wouldn't be, uh, dinner with Agent Liz Warner, would it?
I heard she was back.
I might've mentioned something to him.
seems to me that when you two worked together you were kind of interested in each other.
so?
well?
what are you gonna do?
I don't know. We'll see.
I mean, I'm pretty busy, right?
and, uh, and she's busy.
we'll see.
okay.
so, anything new on the yacht, or...
or the diver's murder? Nah.
the problem is, it's like, uh, we got a mobile crime scene.
you mean the barge? Yeah, I mean, as many as, what, three murders, and, uh, I mean, it could've happened anywhere.
well, we may be able to figure out where it happened.
all right, well, tell me what you need. I'll make it happen.
the question we're asking is quite simple:
how far did this barge go while it was out, and how can we retrace its path?
Oh, come on, Charlie. I'm calling your bluff here.
no, you gotta let him run with this.
it's fun to watch when he gets going.
see, the key is finding possible data sources.
believe it or not, there're a lot more clues out here than you probably even realize-- for instance, how much fuel was consumed?
how many engine hours were logged?
did they record any sonar readings?
how far was this anchor chain run out and was there evidence of a particular algae bloom on the chain?
Ah, I'm having a bad algebra flashback.
if a salvage barge was headed west at six knots in a headwind of eight knots...
Oh, it's not even that difficult.
look, every piece of data is a constraint.
okay?
and the path of the boat must obey every constraint.
so, the set of possible paths is pared down with each new measurement.
see, now I'm gonna make a list of possible data sources.
you two start collecting.
okay, wait. Hang on a second, Charlie.
I actually have information on fuel consumption and engine hours.
hit me with it.
68 gallons and 16 hours.
you sure about that?
that's what it says in the report, Charlie.
I mean, I can double check it, but that's what it says.
what? Charlie, you can't already know where the barge went.
no, but...
I can tell you where it didn't go.
you see, the Cheetah went down here.
approximately 40 miles out.
and according to these engine and fuel hours data...
well, I can tell you right now that this barge traveled a maximum of 20 miles.
round trip.
well, that means it was never more than ten miles out.
which means they were nowhere near where the Cheetah went down.
you know it.
all right, but all of the assumptions that we're making about motive and cause are all attributed to finding that boat.
well, then, your assumptions are wrong.
so if they weren't looking for the racing yacht, what were they looking for?
excuse me, Charles,
I have the admissions list for you.
still working on the racing yacht,
professor? Uh, no, actually.
the case has taken a turn in a different direction.
Oh, really. What is it now?
now, I'm trying to retrace the path of a marine salvage barge.
why would you want to do that?
the FBI suspects there was a murder on board.
Really? And if I can tell them where the barge went, then hopefully figure out who else was in the area.
Oh, you mean the killer.
hmm? Yeah. Still, a barge... ugh.
doesn't quite have the snap and sex appeal of a racing yacht, does it? No, not exactly.
you're reading up on chess? Yes.
okay, good, so...
lasker or Jankowski?
which one's gonna give me a better shot?
Millie, this isn't
come on. the kind of thing that you can learn overnight.
I'm a quick study. I'm very smart.
the game of chess is like a sword fight.
anyway, I can...
professor Eppes.
Oh, men in suits.
if you don't mind, we need to speak to Professor Eppes alone.
uh, I don't mind at all, Charlie.
I'll just read both of them.
tonight. Gentlemen.
perfect timing, gentlemen.
what's this about?
we're with the National Security Agency.
we have a situation, we're hoping you can help us out.
I'm always happy to help you guys.
I am working on something for the FBI right now.
we know what you're involved with, Professor.
we also know that you have an interest in a missing racing yacht.
the Cheetah.
that's why we've come to you.
so you can help us find it.
within hours of the time the Cheetah went down, we had two search vessels in the area.
we've worked around the clock, sonar mapping every inch of the bottom.
and are you sure you're looking in the spot that she went down?
the boat's locator beacon gave precise GPS coordinates until the moment it went under.
still, despite our best efforts, we've found nothing.
may... may I inquire why the N. S.A. is so interested in finding this yacht?
N. S.A. Never Say Anything,
I get it.
you haven't been able to find this boat because you've been looking in the wrong place.
your search pattern, probably assumes that the Cheetah sank something...
something like this.
when in reality...
in reality... the Cheetah probably sank something a little more...
...like that.
it glides forward.
that's correct. It glides forward.
now, a boat like the Cheetah, a boat with this sophisticated a design, it practically flies under water, traveling laterally four, maybe even five feet for every foot that it falls.
now knowing what I know about the hull, given the depth of the water,
I should be able to determine with a fair amount of accuracy just how far she traveled before hitting the bottom.
and then you guys can refocus their search.
how long will it take you? I'll get on it right away.
uh, oh, and Professor...
this is a matter of National Security.
it's need-to-know only, so not a word to anyone.
that includes the FBI.
if the Morris barge was never near where the yacht went down, then they weren't after the yacht.
maybe they're involved in one of the drug operations you were talking about?
Yeah, but drug runners usually stay further out the coastline in international waters.
but I don't think we can rule it out.
I just spoke to the E. R.T. lab.
turns out the other two traces of blood we found definitely belong to Chris and Robert Morris.
how big a leap would it be to assume they're dead, same as their diver?
Yeah, I mean, that would explain why we can't find them.
and if their killer dumped the bodies out in the open ocean, there's no telling how far they could've drifted by now.
maybe not. Can I see that Coroner's report?
there were impressions on the diver's ankles.
here, let's put this up on the screen.
report says the impressions are consistent with having been caused by a rope.
and not the fishing net?
more like something was tied around his ankles.
a weight probably.
so whoever threw him in the ocean probably anchored him down, and for some reason his rope became free and he just drifted, and ended up in the fishing net.
okay, so if that's true, then the Morris brothers could still be anchored to the bottom right where they were dropped.
all right, so we need to talk to Charlie.
he can tell us where that barge went when it was out, we got a good idea where to look for the bodies.
Hey. What's going on? Hey.
why don't you answer your phone?
I'm sorry. I've been busy working.
Oh, no, no, that's all right. What, are you making progress?
here's the thing.
I have to back-burner the, um, salvage barge thing for a while.
what are you talking about?
something else came up.
like what?
I can't talk about it.
look, I think I got two bodies down there on the bottom of the ocean.
I don't know how long they're gonna stay where they were put.
you told me you were gonna figure out where that barge was.
I understand. I'll get on it as soon as I can.
what do you mean "as soon as you can"?
sorry.
well, that's not good enough. "Sorry."
Wh-what's going on?
I don't know. You tell me.
Hey. Hey.
I'm in a no-win situation.
you know, he wants me to do something, I can't right now.
why not?
because I'm doing something else.
all right? Something I can't talk about.
all right, relax.
I'm not gonna ask.
it's your choice what to work on.
what's that suppose to mean?
well, it doesn't mean anything more than what it means.
you know what? It's...
it's moot now anyway, so just forget it.
I-I just... I'm pretty much done with what I'm doing.
I'm just hungry.
you know what, I'll stay.
I'll stay and just do what he wants me to do.
Hey.
what's going on?
last time, with us,
I was just passing through.
now I'm assigned here...
and...
what? And what?
come on.
it's complicated now.
yeah? Why's that?
people will find out.
so what? So what?
Yeah. This is the bureau.
it matters. Ah...
a lot of agents are together.
where does your prosecutor girlfriend fit into all this?
she doesn't.
here. I'm done.
here's everything you need.
uh, actually, pal, it's a little late.
you don't want it now?
no, no, sorry, I want it.
look, Charlie, I want it;
it's just we can't get a boat out there till morning, that's all.
you were able to map out the barge's path?
sort of. I laid out a large grid.
I mean, they'll have to check it, but there's a better than an 83% chance that it covers the Morris barge's operations.
it's just as I figured.
they never left the shallow water.
search Team One completing the sweep of Grid Four.
all right, well, GPS coordinates put us right on the edge of Abalone Cove.
Charlie, we're going to be coming around to the port side now and beginning another pass.
okay, uh, copy that.
Charlie, you said last night there was an 83% chance that the Morris barge was actually working within your search grid, right? That's right.
okay, well, there's still a 17% chance they weren't.
wow, Liz, I didn't realize you were such a glass-half-empty type.
you know, 83% is still a very high probability.
whoa.
go back.
what was that?
Hey, did you guys see that?
Yeah, Charlie.
sonar mapping's picking it up, too.
let me steer the camera back around.
uh, I think it was back this way a little bit. He'll get it.
it's a body.
confirm, a body.
sonar mapping's seeing two of them.
Chris and Robert Morris.
I never doubted you, Charlie.
wait a minute.
sonar's reading something else down there.
is that another body?
negative, this is much bigger.
looks like a vessel.
can you get a video on it?
it's the Cheetah.
no, it can't be. I've done all the calculations.
it shouldn't be anywhere near here.
?Shouldn't, but it did?
none of this makes sense.
all the available pieces of data we have indicate that this yacht went down 40 miles out to sea.
so how do you explain it showing up so close to shore?
we have no idea.
the Morris brothers-- they knew exactly where to look.
what do you make of this?
Morris Marine Salvage.
lift bags.
they're used to raise a sunken ship up to the surface.
they'd already brought her up.
why would somebody bring up a $2 million prize and then throw it back?
Where's the agent in Charge?
professor Eppes,
I suppose you think you're pretty clever.
I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean.
you intentionally sent us in the wrong direction so you could help your brother find this yacht.
no, no, no, I know it looks like that, but believe me...
you'll be lucky if you don't lose your security clearance.
whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
agent Cordero, Agent Graves, I did nothing wrong.
what's going on here? You Eppes?
Yeah. You look worse than your brother in all this.
and where are you guys from? NSA.
do you have any idea how many taxpayer dollars you wasted sending us in the wrong direction?
back off already. He doesn't know.
I mean, how many times do you want him to say it?
we weren't looking for the yacht.
we, we were tracing the path of a salvage barge...
and you just happened to find her. What luck.
I'm gonna go now.
no, you're not. Yes, you are.
go ahead, it's fine?
look, guys.
clearly, we thought we were working on different cases.
obviously, we're not, so why don't we cut all the interagency crap and try to figure out what's going on?
can you please tell me what is the NSA's interest in this?
Aw, come on, please, give me a break.
okay.
NSA's been tracking an arms dealer named Hashim Aziz.
he's Pakistani, terrorist ties.
he's on every agency's watch list.
what, you think he's connected to this?
aziz recently transferred a large sum of money to Reid Sarasin.
the skipper?
the reason for the payment is unknown.
best guess right now?
that yacht was smuggling something for Aziz.
all right, so now I understand why someone would pull it up a-and throw it back.
they got what they wanted.
the thing is we don't know what it was.
right.
all of our search efforts for the Cheetah have been focused right in this area here, and that's only for one reason.
because that's where the locator beacon stopped transmitting.
right, and the assumption was it stopped transmitting because the boat went underwater.
but there are other reasons the beacon might have quit, right?
say you're the skipper Reid Sarasin, right?
you're the last man on the boat, you're taking on water, and you're smuggling something.
you're gonna try and get to shallow water cause it's the only way you can recover whatever it is you're smuggling.
and you don't want anybody to know where the boat winds up.
once my crew's gone, I turn off my homing beacon, aim my yacht for the closest shoreline.
right, it explains why the boat wound up so close in, and it explains how the Morris brothers knew where it was-- because Sarasin told them.
which means he didn't drown at sea.
he's still alive.
no good deed goes unpunished, right?
Hey, come on, look, don't worry about those NSA guys.
you know what I do feel pretty bad about is putting your stuff on the back burner.
you know, I was so obsessed with that boat that when they gave me the chance to work on it,
I just jumped.
Yeah, well, maybe you should feel bad then.
no, no, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding, buddy. Listen.
they told me, actually, they think the Cheetah was smuggling something.
smuggling? Yeah.
don, that makes perfect sense.
Why? You mean you knew?
no.
but I was looking for a flaw in the boat's design, and the hull must have failed because it was carrying an extra load, extra weight it wasn't designed to handle. What were they smuggling?
they were in 16 different ports all over the world.
right? So, I mean, if they did pick up anything it could've been loaded on anywhere.
not exactly.
well, how do you know?
I was studying the boat's performance.
its pace slowed slightly after a stop in Singapore.
they, they took on extra weight?
Yeah, matter of fact, you know, it wouldn't be too difficult to calculate exactly how much extra weight they took on.
yeah? All right, come on.
back in? Yeah, yeah.
are those guys still here?
don't worry about them.
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Come here. Listen.
listen, whatever the, the Cheetah was smuggling, apparently it picked up in Singapore.
how do you know that?
because Charlie says it was moving slower after it left this port.
so does that mean anything to you guys?
it could.
Cobalt-RE is a missile guidance system.
Uh-huh. Four units disappeared from a Pakistani army base 12 weeks ago.
NSA's been tracking them.
they lost them crossing into Thailand, but if you continue on that trajectory...
right. Singapore.
Cobalt's relatively compact and easy to program, but its main advantage is that it's capable of being mated with several Katyusha-style rockets.
katyushas are common, but they're not considered a grave threat because they fly a ballistic trajectory.
they... You aim and fire; they go where they go...
Yeah, but not if they're attached to those guidance systems, right?
you know? I mean, how much they weigh?
four units, 85 pounds each, plus the crates...
a little over 400 pounds.
418 pounds is what I got.
they're here. They're in the U. S.
?yeah, they have been there for two days?
so what exactly are we up against?
we know the guidance systems were pulled off the Cheetah about 38 hours ago, so the question is, where are they now?
I think the question is where are they headed?
and does that party have the rockets to marry them to?
now, our best lead is Reid Sarasin, the skipper on the Cheetah.
what do we know about him?
he's a top- notch sailor, but, like most of the skippers in the race, he's really just a gun-for-hire.
I doubt his loyalties to the owner go much beyond whatever he has to do to make a paycheck.
good. How do we find him?
his wife's in L. A.
let's get her in here.
I don't see you as a woman in mourning, Mrs. Sarasin.
that's 'cause I haven't given up hope my husband will be found.
right. That, or he's already contacted you and let you know he's still alive.
that's ridiculous.
there's still a search out looking for him...
your husband races yachts around the world?
must be pretty exciting.
I don't do much traveling anymore.
I didn't mean for you.
I can't imagine he's around much, huh?
and you have... three children?
what do my kids have to do with this?
well, it paints a pretty complete picture for me.
all I see is you at home, alone, raising three children, and your husband is out partying like he's still 25 years old.
haven't you made enough sacrifices for this man?
the nature of what your husband was smuggling, Mrs. Sarasin, means that he can be classified as a terrorist, and the fact that you're helping him means that you can be classified as a terrorist also, and you can be detained indefinitely.
which means you'd be sacrificing your kids, too.
is that something you really want to do for him?
do you think he would ever do something like that for you?
so, this boat belongs to a friend of the Sarasins.
the wife says he's been hiding out on it for a while.
you're lead.
federal Agents! Come on out!
he's not in here.
looks like he was.
do you think his wife tipped him off?
no, I don't, but she might have known he was already gone.
I'll call it in to Don.
see if they wanna have another go at the wife.
Hey, guys, come here.
take a look at that.
all right, Captain Nemo.
let's go.
up on the dock.
you think I chose to put those crates on my boat?
my life was threatened.
I was forced to.
Yeah, they forced you to cash that big check they wrote for you, too?
the whole thing unraveled when the damn boat started leaking.
I mean it was supposed to be easy, just sail in, unload the crates, sail out on the next leg of the race.
who'd you give the guidance systems to?
who'd you meet with on this end?
two guys.
I don't know their names.
all I had was a phone number.
Hey, pal, you better do better than that.
you're looking at a triple murder rap.
wait, are you kidding me?
triple murder rap. I had nothing to do with that!
no? Look, all I did was sail the boat, that's it.
I didn't kill anybody.
Yeah, you were there.
you were on the salvage barge.
Yeah, I was there to show these two guys where the Cheetah went down so they could find their crates.
I had no idea they were gonna kill the crew after they got what they wanted.
Reid, we need to know where those crates are now.
I don't know.
when did you last see them?
when we came back in on the barge.
they unloaded the crates onto a truck, you know, one of those yellow box vans.
did you hear them say anything about where they were going?
not exactly, but...
I do know that they weren't planning on leaving L. A. right away.
they were waiting.
they were waiting?
for what?
for missiles.
missiles in Los Angeles
you gotta be pretty damn committed to the cause to be smuggling missiles into the U. S.
NSA have any idea who the end customer is on this?
hashim Aziz is an arms dealer at heart.
his politics would never keep him from selling to the highest bidder.
I'll tell you that. So now it could be anybody?
all right, I just brought Homeland up to speed.
they're gonna up security force, but... l right.
Charlie's back, excellent.
come on, I'll catch you up. Let's go, guys.
according to Sarasin, the guidance systems left the docks in a yellow box van similar to this one.
a rental? We don't know for sure.
we've got Agents checking with all the local rental companies.
suspects are two males,
middle-eastern descent.
the contact number they gave Sarasin traces to a "world phone,"
it's a Jordanian carrier and they won't help us.
our people are generating a list of Hashim Aziz's known associates in Los Angeles.
maybe Sarasin can help ID one of them.
no, that's a long shot.
this whole thing's a long shot.
we got two suspects with a 40-hour lead on us in a city of eight million?
your odds aren't good. All right, so, you got anything?
I don't, but our friends at the NSA might.
after all, you guys have the most comprehensive space-based surveillance and reconnaissance network in the entire world.
professor, we've thought about satellites, but the problem with that type of application is that there's just too much information.
we've got four birds above us...
five.
I'm sorry, five birds.
Yeah, Geo-16 was put into orbit in August.
fine.
five birds, sending constant imaging of 4700 square miles,
I mean, do you have any idea of how much information that is?
you could spend 30 years going through the images and still now find what you're looking for.
not if we apply a target discrimination algorithm.
I don't know what that is.
well, you do.
no offense, but even a five year old knows.
see, he uses it every time he goes to his toy box.
let's say he's looking for his favorite little yellow truck.
but his toy bin is filled with all his other toys.
first he eliminates the stuffed animals.
then the airplanes, then the action figures.
he continues sorting by size, color, weight.
until he finds his little yellow truck.
and I can do the same thing with satellite images.
I create an algorithm that tells the computer what we're looking for and what we're not looking for that weeds out false alarm variables and compensates for urban clutter.
all right, good, so, what do you need?
I'm gonna need access to your computers.
I'll make the call.
Hey, still searching.
long time.
well, I've added criteria to the discrimination filter.
I mean, that should help.
what's it doing now?
Yeah, we're getting some images now.
there's likely to be a lot at first.
got a yellow box truck outside a port warehouse in San Pedro.
Yeah, how do you know it's the right one?
the banked satellite images, followed its trail all the way back to Morris Salvage.
all right, let's go, let's hit it.
spotters have two sentries inside the rear door.
they have two inside, Southeast corner.
go, let's go, hit it.
drop it!
get out of the car!
get down! Down on the ground!
Colby, you okay?
we're good, Don.
you all right?
Yeah.
crates are all here, full.
the guidance systems accounted for.
how about missiles? Any sign of them?
we found this shipping invoice inside.
a container ship coming in tomorrow from Malaysia.
teak furniture.
I don't think these guys are waiting on a patio set?
gotta call in the Coast Guard.
we'll be waiting for 'em tomorrow with Homeland security when the missiles arrive.
all right, good job, guys.
you, too.
Yeah, we'll go get some beers some time, huh.
several.
all right.
nice work.
Yeah, you, too.
we're all right together.
see.
that's what I've been telling you, huh?
I don't wanna get hurt.
Yeah.
kinda goes with the territory though doesn't it?
Yeah, easy for you to say.
Oh, yeah, why's that?
I know your reputation, Mr. No Commitments.
I just haven't met the right girl yet.
okay.
let's take it slow.
keep it to ourselves.
Yeah, look, I'm in the FBI.
I know how to keep a secret.
good.
see you tomorrow, Agent.
that's special Agent to you, by the way.
uh...
sorry.
understood.
take your time.
thank you.
okay.
that's what I thought.
no, that, that was, uh, fine.
what?
will you just pick up a piece.
and move it.
I will.
Hey, what's going on?
we're playing chess?
Oh, is that what it is? Yeah.
cause I sure don't recognize that.
what are you so grumpy about?
I'm not.
your father has a "tell."
what, as in poker?
Mm-hmm. Alan's has a chess tell.
Oh, would you listen to... I have a "tell?
the woman has ruined the spirit of the game.
I mean, this is supposed to be about strategy, about anticipation.
this is supposed to be art.
you beat him, didn't you?
I did.
I'm so sorry.
the first game.
but it wasn't his fault.
he had no idea that I was reading him.
no, I was just being nice. You were nice.
you play poker, do you, Millie?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
it wasn't just the fellowship that got me through grad school, G-man.
I think I'm hearing a bit of a challenge there.
what do you guys say?
for what Poker?
kid... against the Eppes ladies?
Ooh.
Oh, yes.
I'm in. Anything is better than playing this anymore.
I'm in. All right. Let's do it.
Oh, wait, there's, there's no beer.
you heard the lady, get her a beer.
all right, we're gonna do a little, uh, practice round.
till the beverages arrive. All right.
how about, uh, seven card, hi-lo, blind declare... and please, no whining.
bring it on, bring it on.
you ate every chip and all the dip.
no, I didn't.
you guys are like The Three Stooges.
all right, chip, dip, skip, let's go.
SS Get on the ground, all of you! Do not move!
drop the bag!
get on the floor now!
hands above your head!
Hey, you ain't cops!
no. We're not cops.
what the hell you doing?
protecting the innocent. Punishing the guilty.
now this, I have not seen before.
say, Nikki, your boys at LAPD couldn't handle a little B&E?
b&es they can handle just fine.
but they do need help tracking down a group of vigilantes.
Vigilantes-- might explain the message on the wall.
Yeah, fifth incident in two months.
similar situations, same type of victims.
what, these mooks are victims?
Yeah, got five subjects-- ages 16 to 19.
white, Latino, black. No gang affiliations.
they were found with lock picks, crowbars, cable cutters, and backpacks full of school computer equipment.
wrapped up like Christmas presents for the police.
Yeah, the vigilantes ambushed them.
high-powered lights. Improvised flash-bangs. Plastic restraints.
what about "Vanguard? " That come up on any of the databases?
nada. -So you don't have anything?
no, just got this cell phone. Found it here on the floor.
dropped by a vigilante, robbers?
Yeah, or a student. I mean, it could be anybody.
if they can't tell us anything, this might.
someone scraped out the MIN and the ESN. -Translation.
the MIN's a phone number; the ESN's the electronic serial number.
so, this wasn't dropped on the floor by a student.
well, getting rid of the phone number is easy.
getting rid of the ESN is supposed to be impossible.
well, you can add, right?
well, add up the cost of the equipment you were trying to steal, and that's grand larceny.
it's first offense. We won't do time.
Oh, yeah?
who told you that?
you know, I'm looking at the two of you, and I just don't see masterminds.
but you knew where all the computers were, and you knew how to get past an alarm system.
so, I'm thinking you had some help.
keep your mouth shut.
maybe you and I should have a talk alone.
you know what'll happen.
I don't know nothing.
it's the third round with these guys.
never figured the FBI couldn't get a bunch of kids to talk.
they're scared to death of someone.
well, the lobby's filling up with parents and lawyers.
we're running out of time.
Cold-boot attack?
Yeah, also known as a "cold ghosting attack," "iceman attack.
normally, when I remove the memory chip, all the data stored in it will be lost instantly.
but if I freeze it first...
the data remains readable, for sometimes as long as several minutes.
you got it. -That actually worked.
of course. -Just match that to a cell carrier's ESN and...
we get the name and address, and we go get him.
thanks a lot. Have a good day.
put it down! Put it down now!
what the hell is going on? -Are you Bai Lan Zhou?
what? No! -Bai Lan? Where is he?
he? You don't know what you're talking about.
we know Bai Lan owns this phone. And it's registered to this address.
Hey, Grandma.
the FBI has your phone.
no, I got it.
uh, Bai Lan Zhou? -And that's her phone.
it never leaves her sight.
texting charges are through the roof.
someone must have cloned her number. -Sorry, uh, for the inconvenience.
inconvenience?
if you need to file a complaint, just...
the truck's stolen. There's a crew unloading electronics off of it.
the driver said it was a bunch of kids.
one of these vigilantes kids.
two shotgun slugs to the chest. Someone decided to fight back.
check this out.
looks like we got ourselves a feud.
W deceased as Peter Hathaway.
22, Grad student at Mission Hills College.
thesis candidate in systems engineering.
talked to the parents, said they never heard of "Vanguard" or vigilante activity.
need to find the rest of these guys before they get themselves killed.
all right, friends, students, teachers-- and who is running the crew?
where are they based? -And how did this war start?
Hey, can I show you something? -Yeah.
now, the kids we arrested at the school robbery?
they all live in the same general neighborhood.
it's LAPD nickname, because of this guy-- Vic Tooner.
suspected in dozens of crimes, including murder.
LAPD hasn't been able to get anything on him.
witnesses, informants-- they all turn up dead.
this guy's got an entire neighborhood terrified.
now, he runs his crew military-style, you know, organized.
posts sentries to watch out for cops 24-7.
he's smart, but he's also crazy.
he once murdered one of his own lieutenants just for driving the same kind of car he drives.
and he's got the kids working for him.
Yeah, he uses kids because he knows if they get caught, they'll be back on the street in a few weeks.
it's like old Fagin.
Yeah, explains the murdered vigilante.
Tooner wouldn't tolerate anyone messing with his operation.
cell phones can be cloned using a DDI-- Digital Data Interpreter.
Yeah, cellular thieves sit by busy roads and pick up radio wave transmissions.
so, serial numbers, and phone numbers of people passing by are captured and recorded.
eat. Now you tell me.
can they monitor me if all I'm doing is playing Tetris?
so, can we trace these DDI devices?
unfortunately, they don't emit enough of a signal.
all right, so this is a dead end.
actually, maybe not. -Can I see this?
Yeah, you know, Vanguard has advanced engineering skills.
so maybe they're getting access to the robbery crews' communications...
and if we figure out how, maybe it'll give the FBI a lead on where the next robbery will happen.
okay, how do you go about doing that?
that's a... a difficult problem.
three words: Deep. Current. Sets.
and the expert on them is guest lecturer at CalSci at the moment.
Marshall Penfield? -He's your friend, right?
friend? -Um, more like a "frienemy."
Oh, yeah. That's that guy you're always having those math fights with.
the guy who calls Charles "Eppsy."
well, I mean, he did help out with that home invasion case a couple years ago.
tangentially.
well, Charlie, we gotta get this thing figured out before anybody else gets killed, okay? So...
I know. I know. Professor Fleinhardt, a word?
you know, actually, I'm expecting to hear from a colleague at CERN and you know how wounded particle physicists get when-when their calls go to voicemails.
anyway... ciao.
I want to talk to you about your roommate, Peter Hathaway.
like I told the police, I didn't know him very well.
and though you shared a room with him for nearly a year?
we didn't hang out.
what do you know about him?
he was lonely. You could see it.
sometimes he tried to talk to me about classes, something he was reading.
but, you know, I'm so busy with classes and tutoring.
did his behavior change recently?
well, he used to be here every night, but starting about three months ago, he went out a lot.
and did he indicate where?
and maybe mentioned a group called Vanguard.
no, never said a word. And I never asked where he was going, so.
what? What is it?
I don't know. Maybe if I'd tried to talk to him a little, invited him to hang out with me and my friends
he wouldn't have gotten mixed up in whatever he was doing...
when he died.
look, I gotta go.
Peter's parents are coming today. And I have no idea what I'm going to tell them.
from set theory's inception, some have argued that it's a game that includes elements of fantasy.
wittgenstein questioned how Zermelo. Fraenkel set theory handled infinities.
Errett Bishop dismissed it as "God's mathematics, which we should be left for God to do.
next week's discussion will be on the spectral theory of non-Hermitian random matrices, okay?
you're welcome. I'll see you next week.
you math geniuses.
Where's the glasses? -Where's the hair?
you know, these CalSci students really can appreciate an incisive discussion from a guest lecturer.
how can they resist your charms? -Yes. It is impossible, isn't it?
speaking of which, how is Amita?
are you two still dating? -Yeah.
Really?
well, good for you, Eppsy.
Marshall. -Yes?
I'm going to ask you something, -Okay.
and if it's at all possible you can managenotto launch into your smirky world of glee, -it'd be appreciated. -Moi?
I've been working on a case, you know, for the FBI, and, uh, it might benefit from your work in deep current set theory.
so Charlie Eppes is asking for my help... a second time.
what too gleeful?
sure. Be fun.
Yeah, I can't sleep either.
I've got this ratio-of-green-space problem for CalSci landscaping I can't get out of my head.
what is this? Non-FBI math?
not for long.
professor Marshall Penfield?
he's working on a case with you?
Hey, so, this Saturday, you want to have Amita and Don and Robin over for brunch?
better make it dinner. I got golf and Don's going to temple.
since when does Don go to temple?
I don't know. A few weeks ago, I guess.
the LAPD responded to an alarm at an auto sound shop about five weeks ago.
found three teenagers in restraints, like at the school.
back then, they didn't know they had an ongoing problem.
so maybe something got overlooked?
good thinking, Granger.
they did miss something.
what are you showing me, the gang signs?
I spent a year on LAPD gang task force. I never seen nothing like that.
mean anything to you?
uh, not immediately, but there might be a subset within the superset.
and for those of us who don't speak math?
I'm talking about set theory.
let say this circle represents objects visible in the night sky.
and this circle represents objects that generate light.
where they overlap is a subset.
objects visible in the night sky that generate light, like a star.
how do you not have your own show on PBS?
the big question in this case is, obviously, how do the vigilantes know where the robbery crews will strike?
and that's where Marshall's deep current theory comes in.
it looks for undetected sets.
think of patterns in crowds. Crowds move in general patterns, but relatively minor events in specific areas can change the overall pattern for everyone, even if most never see what created the change.
this approach allows us to deduce information about the hidden nodes from the anomalies in the observed behavior of the visible network.
is that an accurate assessment, Marshall?
Oh, I'm sorry. I must've dozed off during your riveting monologue.
I was stating the problem.
Yeah, your approach to the problem. -Using your method.
being as though it's my method, shouldn't I be the one leading this inquiry?
well, this isn't a seminar, Marshall.
it's a criminal investigation.
so, uh...
so then you have, uh, handcuffs?
Oh, yeah. That'll get you there.
I like the sound of that. -Well, don't.
okay.
Where'd you find this?
at a business where the vigilantes caught some thieves.
it's a computer code.
why would anyone use a few random computer code symbols?
unless it isn't random.
Yeah. What about that?
it would take pages of code to say anything meaningful.
what if it's not a computer code, but a cipher code?
it could take months to figure out.
no, they painted it on a wall. I doubt they made it hard to crack.
well, maybe it's a simple Vigenere cipher.
well, then match the first 13 letters of the alphabet to those 13 code symbols.
and what if the keyword is "vanguard"?
is that a Web site?
I don't know. Let's find out.
vanguard's Web site.
those are robberies the vigilantes stopped.
they even have the exact times that each robbery was supposed to happen.
and look at the last one.
appliance warehouse downtown. And the date?
that's today.
vic Tooner. -" Who's that?"
that... is trouble.
well, he doesn't look friendly.
daytime robbery.
Tooner is looking to flush out Vanguard where he can see 'em.
they're taking the stuff.
Yeah, I'm watching.
it's just the robbers. There's no sign of Tooner.
vanguard isn't showing either.
you got anything? -Negative. All zones are clear.
done. The crew's moving out.
we got to move in.
all right. Let's go. All units, move in. Take 'em.
none of Tooner's kids looked armed for a showdown.
let's check out these people here. Let's check out all these people here.
you want to look at the crowd? See if anyone's wearing a Vanguard symbol.
that we found.
the east perimeter found him on the rooftop with this, filming the robbery.
they kill one of yours, you show up with a camera?
my mission was to gather evidence, not to intervene.
what mission? Who is a part of this mission with you?
I was there to record the incident, nothing else.
is that against the law?
prior knowledge of a crime? Yeah, that's a problem.
who are you working with?
we don't use names. We use code names.
if we're captured, we can't compromise the operation.
do you know him?
we call him Bars.
his code name.
bars?
Yeah, you know, like on a cell phone?
he's a phreaker.
a phone expert-- could do stuff with cell phones.
how do you know which places to rob?
there's a Web site, or you get a phone call...
or a guy comes to your house.
that's how you get the word, where to go, what to steal.
and who gives the word?
nobody talks about that.
you're gonna take the full weight for stuff you didn't plan or control.
it's worth it to do what's right.
and what's that? -Doing what needs to be done.
what the cops haven't been able to do.
do you know a guy named Vic Tooner?
never heard of him.
not ever.
Tooner seems to have a deep supply of kids, all of them too scared to talk.
the guy from Vanguard was stonewalling us also, but he's not scared.
what's that about?
maybe someone inspired him.
he speaks like a covert op on a mission.
they both have the same methods.
only one is pure damn evil and the other one's trying to play hero.
you're wrong. Its structure lacks originality or integrity.
it's a classic organization, based on tested and proven elements.
it's a chain.
it's a chain with irregularities that come with maintaining complex matrices.
Oh, so you propose that a single point mechanism provides superior output?
enough.
surely, two eminent mathematicians can find ways to calmly discuss theory.
we're not discussing theory.
no, we're talking hamburgers.
pie 'n' Burger's the best, man. There's no question about it.
in 'n' Out is far superior.
I remember a day, not long ago, when you were both undergrads, workingtogether on a topology problem.
that's only because you assigned us to work on it together.
and we preferred working alone. -Which is my point.
neither of you is gifted at the art of collaboration, which is most crucial in science.
who is this? Is this one of our students?
no. It's a grad student at Harvey Mudd College.
the FBI arrested him in connection with the vigilante.
no one else in his circle seems connected to vigilante activities.
but this student is defined by the same deep current as the other vigilantes.
so we should look at the super sets as they define this student.
like that the fact that he is a student.
precisely. When there is a finite number of grad students in the region.
even fewer with the computing and telecommunication skills required.
Yeah, they hide the organization, so you need to refine the search by eliminating people openly linked to identified Vanguard members.
so we work up an algorithm that does that, and...
we just set it loose in grad school databases.
Ah, the sweet sound of collaboration.
this will ID students who fit the profile of Vanguard members.
the results will be based on probability, so you can't just arrest people whose names pop up.
I get it. You don't want us making life miserable for innocent grad students.
that's what professors are for.
you guys work with bright kids.
why do you think these Vanguard guys would risk their lives going up against a violent criminal.
a hazard of being smart.
you figure you can outthink anybody.
you look at life like a chess game.
make smart moves, you win.
this isn't a game, or a classroom problem.
everybody knows our name, but nobody's glad we came.
I've never seen a neighborhood this scared.
Hey, these are for you.
Thanks, little guy. Who sent them over?
I heard you guys were looking for me.
he used to pull this with LAPD.
walk up to officers on the street, come in for interviews.
he knows we don't have anything.
I own a tattoo parlor.
legal, licensed business.
what do you know about robbery teams run out of your neighborhood?
well, I hope the police can do something about that.
well, somebody's trying to do something about that.
well, I understand why people do that.
I'm a concerned citizen, like anybody else.
I know how difficult it is to police an urban area with a gang subculture and a black market economy.
you'd have to spend years working to infiltrate highly secretive groups that are paramilitary in their operation.
so, we got ourselves a concerned citizen.
I studied police sciences.
I took classes at City College.
Hey, maybe I'll apply to the academy.
you know, I bet you I could ace that obstacle course.
what do you know about a group called Vanguard?
just what I hear on the street.
and what's that? -Smart guys.
in over their heads.
over their heads? How so?
Oh, you know, emotionally. Living in a dreamworld.
what do you think's going to happen to them?
what happens to anybody?
some will quit. Some will have accidents.
accidents? -Accidents.
car accidents, whatever.
also, depression's a problem for college kids.
you, uh... you might find one of them way in the back of a library, note pinned to his chest, hanging from a rafter.
what does it matter?
one by one, sooner or later, everybody dies.
where are you going?
this is a noncustodial interrogation.
I can leave whenever I want.
you ruined it. Look at it
you flattened the tip, and now it's completely out of ink.
how was I supposed to know that you like to use scented markers and that your favorite flavor is strawberry?
well, listen, you know, do me a favor and just bring your own markers, okay?
here's another thing. Your idea about the analysis of Vanguard's previous attacks, it totally ignores the cardinality of the union of sets.
you know, it's funny, Marshall, it's my idea, so I think I know how it's supposed to work.
Oh, who is the expert on deep current sets here?
huh? Me.
why does he always negate my proposals?
why are you so dismissive? -Why are you so competive?
boys, don't make me pull the math car over.
this isn't about math, is it, Eppsy?
maybe it's about you calling me Eppsy. -Anyway...
I was thinking that if someone at Vanguard is that familiar with the computer source code,
I should probably take a closer look at the browser code on the Web site.
Yes, programmers often use distinctive object
oriented symbols, uh, statements, method calls.
exactly. My comparative analysis shows the Vanguard code is very similar to a code found at the intrauniversity astrophysics project.
note that success results not from the Eppes method nor from the Penfield approach, but from the Ramanujan scan.
all right, well, Amita, can you find the name of the person who wrote this code?
cause that might be the leader of Vanguard.
why do I let Marshall get to me? -He's a rival.
look, everybody has one, and frankly, who they are says a lot about who you are.
Yeah, what does Marshall hating me say about me?
he doesn't hate you.
what is that word that Amita uses?
Frienemy. - There you go.
colleagues as well as rivals.
I think you just remind each other of a time in your careers when you were both less secure in your reputations.
what about you? Who sets you off?
al McNabb. Guy in my car club.
he absolutely covets my Ford roadster, yet he always says the leather is not restored to 1931 period standard, the color's all wrong.
he is just one jealous bastard.
you know who doesn't have a rival?
seriously, I've never heard him talk about anyone like that.
well, Don questions and challenges himself.
he's like his own frienemy, so to speak.
you know, maybe that's why he's going to temple.
what is it that Rabbi Abraham Heschel said?
the primary task of the philosophy of religion is to discover those questions to which religion is an answer.
now, did my dad tell you that?
about Don going to temple?
no, Don did.
he told you? He didn't tell me.
what's up?
uh, nothing much.
it's just something Tooner said about, um, the Vanguard members having accidents, you know, a suicide in a library.
maybe we should call the local colleges. -All right.
so, what did Nikki say about Tooner?
smart, but crazy?
looks like the crazy part.
Mason Spellman, 19. Physics major.
me thinks he was dead about ten hours before his body was found.
in the engineering library, pretty much like Tooner said, in general terms.
Robin's gonna definitely say we need more than this.
especially since Spellman had a problem with depression.
no other fingerprints at the crime scene except for his.
the note's in his own handwriting.
so, we think we know how Tooner's been able to locate those vigilantes.
the deep current set analysis reveals that he's found some way to reverse engineer their technology.
right, so we're gonna try to duplicate Tooner's math.
all right, that sounds good.
none of the dead kids have a connection to Tooner that we can find, but I'm thinking somebody in Vanguard, they must have crossed paths with him somewhere.
right, hey, see if you can find out any of those college courses that he took.
Tooner audited courses at Occidental and Whittier, as well as City College.
and while at City College,
LAPD had him as a person of interest in the rape and murder of a student, Lori Sanchez.
never met her, but I heard she died.
how did you hear that?
it was a topic of discussion.
with who? -I told you.
I don't know names, but a lot of people care when an innocent person dies.
you really think that this is all revenge for one murdered girl?
let's find out more about her.
what's up, kid?
on my way to school. Got to get through that analysis for you.
you and Marshall really set each other off, huh?
Yeah, I know. I know, we're, uh, frienemies.
where is Dad? -He's around.
Hey, Don. -Yeah?
so, you started going to temple?
did Dad tell you that? -And Larry.
there some reason you didn't tell me?
I don't know, you know, it's just like that thing you're always saying about not contaminating experiments.
Yeah.
Charlie, I don't know where I'm going with any of it. I just...
I can't get into a scientific debate with you about whether it's logical or not.
since when did you listen to everything I say?
you know, you can be pretty intimidating.
to you? -To everybody.
I-I think going to temple is an interesting choice. I have nothing negative to say about that.
okay, cool.
at least it's not a monastery.
all right, see you at dinner, all right? -Yeah.
what, you were standing there listening?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard every word, yeah.
okay, so let's have it.
I think you did a good job all these years hiding any sign that he intimidates you.
well, that's what I think. -All right.
so, the vigilante who wrote the coding...
he was involved in this astrophysics project?
Yes. Similar phrases and styles.
who do you think killed Lori Sanchez?
that Vic Tooner creep.
but the police said there was no evidence.
there was no mention in the file about a boyfriend.
she didn't have one.
was there anybody special, some guy that maybe liked her?
okay, I have it down to one programmer.
so, that's the person behind Vanguard's computer network.
he worked as a tutor. Super smart, had a huge crush on Lori.
his name was Clayton. -Here's his personal Web site.
we think this is the leader of the vigilantes.
Clayton Caswell, studying for his master's in computer engineering, tutored Lori Sanchez.
been missing three days, so he's either hiding out or Tooner got to him and we just haven't found his body yet.
no, we'd have found him. Tooner would make sure of that.
well, run down every place he can can be. I'll see if I can get Charlie on it.
takes a nerd to catch a nerd, huh?
all right, enough of the "I don't know names" crap.
I know you know Clayton Caswell.
what does it matter now?
he's gonna die-- that's why it matters
and the rest of Vanguard with him because Tooner has figured out how to get to them.
Clayton can handle it. -He can't handle it.
he's gonna get a lot of people killed.
so, where is he?
I don't know, okay?
I wasn't told where they'd hide if it came to this.
this is all about a girl who died.
I get why Clayton wants revenge against Tooner for Lori Sanchez, but what about the
Clayton's the type of guy...
when he wants you to do something, he makes you feel like you can make a difference, like you're part of something important and special.
so, you guys want to be heroes?
Yeah.
don't you?
God, why am I so stupid?
do you want answers one through 50, or 50 through a hundred?
the regional cell matrix.
that's the deep current.
Tooner mines the regional cell phone matrix for data on the movement of merchandise.
vanguard mines Tooner's cell matrix subset.
you know, if we set up derivatives...
what, for all regional cell calls?
you realize that'll take days on the supercomputer.
like you have a better approach?
Yeah, we'll just narrow down the data set.
it's quite logical.
why are we fighting about it?
well, I'm not fighting. What else would you call this?
I don't know. You started it.
I did not. -Yes, you did.
what was that?
it's an ongoing analysis of the robberies and past possible targets.
that's a computer repair store. Vanguard's data said Tooner hit that.
there's no police report of a break-in, so that's an anomaly.
maybe it wasn't reported.
I mean, we need this information for the data grid.
maybe Vanguard left its graffiti symbol.
want to go on a field trip?
so, where are the wonder twins?
Oh, they probably started arguing, forgot all about food.
Oh, man, I'm starving.
looks open.
Hello? Hello?
hello. Is anyone here?
Hi. We're looking for an owner or maybe a manager.
just whoever's in charge.
that would be me.
come here about a computer?
Yeah. We, uh...
we were expecting a call about when to come pick up our system.
it's a, um, compact supercomputer. It's very valuable.
supercomputer?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
uh, eight serial CPUs, uh, vector processing.
it's got a liquid-cooled H-vak system.
it's our baby. It can even calculate the path of, uh, subatomic particles.
or play 300 versions of Halo at the same time.
Yeah, I think I remember that one.
my partner processed that work order.
I'd have to look for it.
maybe that's him.
Hello?
Hey, listen, uh, we can find it if you don't know what you're looking for.
Oh, feel free to look around.
after all, it's your supercomputer.
as they say, mi casa es su casa.
all right. Guys, I got to get.
got to be here somewhere.
Yeah. Uh, well, uh, this...
this isn't it.
um, I think maybe...
Colby, Charlie's on my cell.
I need you to get a location and meet me there with LAPD. You got it?
what's up, Don?
he might be with Tooner.
uh, did you change, the, uh, decorative shell?
no. -Guys.
sorry I can't wait around for you to find your computer.
Yeah. No, no, that's fine. We'll just, uh...
we'll just come back in the morning. Thanks.
don't you want to wait around for your brother, Professor Eppes?
here's a math problem for you.
take the number of people who've seen me at crime scenes.
subtract the number who've testified.
he's gone. -He was just here.
in all of his sociopathic glory. -LAPD is running traffic checks.
I don't understand how you guys ended up here.
well, we thought it was an old crime scene, and it turned out to be a currently active one.
you okay? -Yeah.
adrenaline makes my skin itch.
: in a world where mathematicians go mano a mano with a killer...
: this time, it's personal.
we got to get this guy.
all right, he made me itch in front of strangers.
Oh, he told me he was gonna kill me, you know, in so many words.
it's no wonder the Vanguard kids hate him. He's quite hate-able.
Yeah, if he killed one of my friends,
Clayton Caswell and Tooner-- they hate each other. They want a confrontation.
it sounds like they created a classic game theory scenario, doesn't it?
Yes, it does, Johnny Von Neumann. The old three-man gunfight.
mathematical gunfight, huh?
between three people, okay?
now, I'm the worst shot. I hit the target once every three tries.
one of my opponents is better.
hits it twice every three shots.
the third guy is a dead shot. He never misses.
come on.
now each gets one shot.
as the worst, I go first.
then Charlie, then Colby.
who do I aim for for my one shot?
I guess me,'cause I'm the biggest danger, right?
I shoot Eppsy first, but not for the obvious reasons.
chances are two to one I'm gonna miss.
and now it's my turn. And logic says I shoot Colby.
right,'cause if I'm still standing, I'm gonna shoot you, and I don't miss.
exactly.
as the worst, I use the two better shooters against each other.
you know, Vanguard and Tooner know their communications skills better than we do.
we can use that against them.
we insert our info into their systems, and make it work for us.
we created a target that Tooner can't resist, and we made sure that Vanguard knows about it.
a setup? That's not gonna be obvious?
Oh, not the way we're doing it.
they'll both think that they've got data that the other side doesn't know they have.
well, these guys are gonna come ready for war, so we better gear up.
we're using their hate against each other.
that's kind of ironic.
Hey, I don't hate you.
what? You hate me?
only when you call me Eppsy.
well, I guess it's just a way of dealing with who you are.
what do you mean, who I am?
Charles Eppes. The guy everyone talks about.
you know, you're a pretty intimidating person.
it's the second time today I've gotten that.
onlythe second?
well, you're fairly challenging yourself there, Marshall.
no, seriously. Every time I come up with something new, in the back of my mind I'm thinking, "Penfield's gonna tear this apart.
no. You're just saying this to be nice.
how about a truce?
is this some game theory trick?
if it was, I would be using a fourth-level altruism ploy, right?
Yeah, it's a truce then.
all right.
how does it look?
all clear.
okay.
2, 200 cell phones, 800 iPods.
like going to a supermarket.
60-inch plasma TVs. 32, to be exact.
okay, let's get to work.
come on. Let's get these things open.
now!
well...
well, that had to be disappointing.
what, you're fighting us with bombs you cooked up in chem lab?
well, how did you think this was going to end?
what, you college boys can do what the LAPD and the FBI can't?
put the detonator down.
Tooner, drop it! Tooner, drop it right now.
eat it!
we killed you.
he's-he's done.
we killed you. You're done!
so, Marshall, how do you like your second taste of FBI work?
Oh, it's terrific, with the exception of meeting the psychotic killer face-to-face.
I didn't like that.
that wasn't optimal. -No, it was not.
you two don't seem to be fighting as much.
is that on purpose, or did you just get tired of it?
Oh, no, it's on purpose. I never tire from an argument.
Yes. Well, that's all too apparent.
Marshall and I found that we can actually get along, huh?
Yes. I should have stopped calling you Eppsy years ago.
that's all right. I've been called worse.
Hey, everyone. What do you say, Chuck?
like that.
Yeah.
I like that. I can work with that.
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.
I see.
so, it's not just at home you drop your things - all over the place. - Thanks.
what do you got there? - Uh, it's a police scanner.
well, it's not just the police.
the "Double-E" guys did some modifications.
picks up pretty much every law enforcement band there is.
you're not close enough to the action as it is?
you have to monitor radio calls now?
I just don't want to miss anything.
didn't we move you in here around, what, three weeks ago?
Oh, my gosh, Charlie.
you have to see what I found-- these are amazing.
what are you doing here? I thought you were headed downtown.
Oh, well, that was a lie, so I could surprise you.
I wanted to get all your stuff unpacked and put away.
and I asked Sharon to transpose your work off the boxes.
Sharon? Sharon, thanks.
anybody else buried in the rubble around here?
Nope, just the two of us-- but, Charlie, you have to read these letters.
I found them in the old wall secretary.
Oh, then Beiderman must have left them...
but one is from Beiderman, but another one is from Knox, and another one is from Newberry.
and this one...
dates all the way back to 1922.
it was written by Hightower. - May I?
those are the professors that preceded you in this office, right?
those guys were giants in the math world.
Yeah, but they weren't giants when they wrote these.
that's what's so cool about them.
I mean, they were just starting out.
the letters are about their goals and expectations, what they hoped to accomplish in their careers.
Hightower wrote the first one right after he moved in, almost 90 years ago.
and then, he left it behind for Knox.
then, Knox did the same for Newberry, who did the same for Beiderman.
that's quite an incredible tradition when you come to think of it.
I know.
and now Beiderman left them behind for you.
how cool is that?
well, it was different for those guys 'cause, you know, they started out in this office, and I just moved in from down the hall.
Yeah, but it might be fun, though, huh?
trying to imagine what it will be like 20 years now, what you'll be doing.
70-25, code six. 105 North Anderson...
these guys were smooth.
they got at least six figures and were long gone before the first call went out.
this here is the branch manager, Clifford Hansen.
how are you doing, Mr. Hansen?
so, what can you tell us?
guy came in wearing a maintenance uniform.
went, uh, right for the alarm panel.
by the time the teller alerted me,
I guess he'd already cut the alarm and the cameras.
and it was just the one guy?
three more came in right after, pulling on masks.
camera only caught the first one, though.
and what kind of, uh, masks did the other three wear?
two of them wore, uh, ski masks, you know, and the third guy, the guy who looked like he was in charge, he wore a Bill Clinton mask.
and they put you all in a back room?
and they separated you:
employees in one, customers in the other.
how did you know that?
I'm getting a big-time d\j vu thing about now.
Yeah, two of them cleared out the tellers' drawers, and the other two hit the vault.
Nick, me on... you're starting to freak me out.
Hey, did you hear any gunshots?
we didn't hear anything.
I waited 10 minutes, like they told us, and then, when I came out here, they were gone.
no, no, not all of them.
no, only three of them left.
how did you do that?
this is our dead jack-in-the-box.
his name is Greg Berlin.
habitual B and E guy who specializes in high-end security systems.
well, that's our best lead. Let's get into him.
we can, but I'm pretty sure it's a dead end.
here we go again: the Amazing Nikki.
look, robbery this morning is an exact copy of one I rolled on back when I was a rookie cop.
now, when you say "exact copy..."
I mean every detail, right down to the stiff in the cabinet.
now, if they stuck to the old plan, they hired this guy on right before the heist.
as soon as he finished his bit with the alarms, they put the bullet in his head.
which is why they left him behind.
he's doesn't connect to the rest of the crew-- can't lead back to them.
and he's the only one caught on camera.
other three might as well be ghosts.
well, we got to have a file from that first one, though.
we do-- 2002.
I pulled it already, but it's unsolved-- there were no suspects.
that's just no official suspects, right?
I mean, the lead agent, he'd have some kind of theories.
Yeah, who is it?
take a look at this. The lead agent:
what, who is Bloom?
agent we teamed up with eight months back.
don caught him with his hand in the cookie jar.
ended Bloom's career.
all right. I'll tell you what-- Nikki and I will go give him a try.
why me? - He hasn't met you. He won't hate you yet.
Hey, Bloom. Why don't you let me give you a hand?
I don't need anything from you, Granger.
Hey, he's just trying to help.
Yeah, I'm sure you are.
I'm sure you both drove out here just to help me dig up my sewer line.
you're right. Actually, we came out here 'cause we need your help.
we're working a bank heist.
you find that funny?
funny? I find that hysterical.
I put in 32 years. What did I get?
forced retirement, my pension's revoked,
I'm standing in a mud hole in the middle of my front yard 'cause I can't afford a plumber.
all because of the FBI.
good luck with your case there, agents.
actually, Bloom, it was your case.
bank robbery, 2002.
farmers American Bank. Four-man crew.
capped one of their own, left him behind.
