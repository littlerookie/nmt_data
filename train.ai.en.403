wheatley emphasized the need for the investment banks and brokerages that underwrite share listings in hong kong to take greater responsibility for keeping substandard companies at bay.
wheatley lists almost a hundred commodities imported in song times, ranging from amber to umbrellas, but notes only the usual exports of silk, metals, and porcelain, with no mention of books, maps, calendars, or other such material.
wheatley says hong kong's sfc is looking to tighten the regulation surrounding the selling of retail investment products, and is also seeking additional powers to police corporate behaviour, for example on listing rules.
wheatley speculated that if stimulus money is channeled toward larger state-owned enterprises, as seems likely, smaller private enterprises will struggle to survive the economic downturn.
