get us the hell out of here!
do we know how long? - Not long enough.
I've dated my share of crazies. I know how to deal with this.
I'm not saying this isn't cute. It's adorable.
shall I go now?
but the sooner you open that door, the sooner we can go get that drink.
so let's do it.
shall I go now?
now?
boy.
give me the bag.
who are you?
the bag. - I can't do that.
give... me... the bag.
I've got a buyer who...
he pays me twice as much as whoever, so...
okay. Okay. You and me-- we go in together, 50-50.
I'm gonna drop this. - I'll shoot you.
this is the Parthenon. The is a piece of the parth... do you know how much that's worth?
that's millions. That's...
I'm gonna turn it into dust, I swear to god.
you drop it, I shoot you.
then you don't get paid or breathe.
Yeah. Okay.
you shot me.
barely.
I don't know where Boyd is.
handle man is mia, and echo's vitals are...
th-this is a chart?
they're off it.
Boyd checked in with central eight minutes ago.
apparently, a member of echo's crew absconded with the target item and locked the rest of the team in the vault.
explains the change in vitals.
this is a special skills felony engagement.
I wove more than one thread of unflappable into that tapestry. Okay?
echo could have an exploding belly bomb, and her heart rate shouldn't go past 65 beats a minute.
maybe you made a mistake in the programming.
something's wrong. I'll initiate contact.
Yeah. Echo's not picking up her cell.
you reached out to an active during an engagement without my say-so?
it's the adrenaline. It makes me forget my protocols and "q"S.
echo was talking to Boyd when her vitals spiked.
which is irrelevant if the job's a wash.
I'll finish the job. Just get out of there.
Thanks. See you in a few.
what was that? - Play it again.
I'll finish the job. Just get out of there.
Thanks. See you in a few.
that's not...
that didn't happen.
how do I know that didn't happen? Because that can't happen.
topher, what can't happen？
I'm pretty sure... I'm kind of positive, actually, that something happened.
the exact same thing happened, except without the chair.
you've stated that remote wipes aren't possible.
I've said they're untested.
I've said they're a very bad, bad idea.
I've said I can't do them.
how do we undo it?
we... don't?
somebody out there figured out our frequency, hacked into our call, and that's not even the hard part.
I mean, we're talking about someone... I could not have seen this coming!
this is not my fault!
all right. We'll parcel out the blame later.
what matters now is the reputation of this company.
have an engagement to complete.
I'll confirm that Boyd retrieved the target item.
about echo, how bad is it?
being wiped is not unlike being born. It's traumatic.
I mean, in here, we minimize the trauma with throw pillows and perfectly crunchy lettuce.
there's no conflict. But out there it's all...
fluorescent lights and forceps.
right now, echo is experiencing extreme sensory overload.
that could lead to a coma state.
or it could turn her into "Carrie at the prom.
either way... we have to help her.
she can't help herself.
okay... now you say it.
I'm taffy.
and...
I know how to get us out of here.
Yeah, good. What else?
I try to be my best.
you are the best. You remember? Bonnie and Clyde?
are they here, too?
okay, all right, let's rewind a few minutes.
you were talking on this.
I was talking on this.
you were talking and you said that you could open the door.
I know how to open the door.
Yes, good. So, open it.
I try to be my best?
yeah...
Taffy's gone, man.
and she's not coming back.
Hello, taffy. I'm Adelle Dewitt. I need your help.
blue skies.
lots of people would die to see this stuff.
now it looks like we're going to.
this one's broken.
Yeah, look who's talking.
on the inside.
so, you like... art?
it doesn't look right.
it's not about looking right.
art's about feeling right and you...
have no idea what I'm talking about.
she makes me feel... funny.
well, that's cause these other guys...
they painted what they saw.
but this guy, he painted what is.
that's what art's for: To show us who we are.
this one-- it's saying how we start off whole, then somewhere along the line, the pieces start to slide.
we get broken.
that's sad.
no, it's weak. You can either get broken, or you can be the one doing the breaking.
no mystery which way you went.
ten months of research.
blueprints, security systems, police response time.
the Parthenon job was supposed to be mine.
and now is.
you were running two ponies all along.
it was the client's decision.
Hey, I figured out on my first job, when a little creative thinking on my part almost got me not paid:
never second-guess a client.
and wear comfy shoes.
but I learned how to lap-dance.
we'll pay double your usual fee to extract the team.
getting sidelined by some girl at the last minute-- my feelings are hurt.
I assure you that echo is not "some girl."
you and she are cut from the same cloth.
I've never gotten amnesia during a gig, but whatevs.
three of your peers are locked in that vault with nothing between them and a swat team but you.
there is no balm for a bruised ego like saving the day.
I'll need to see the cash.
we're a bit pressed for time.
of course.
this remote wipe, it's not about just creating five seconds of noise.
he had to break into our system, which is impossible.
he had to get echo's cell number.
he, uh... - or she.
or they. It has to be a "they."
I mean, look at this build. It's not even science. It's art!
you saw the firewalls.
there are many.
I defy another programmer to put that much neurotrophic factor around each and every personality component.
this isn't a lone gunman.
this is a conspiracy.
a gigantic, multi-pronged, conspiracy.
you need to take something.
what is it, Topher?
when you took echo out tonight, did she seem normal?
Yeah, why?
you don't know.
what's going on? - Echo's been wiped. Remotely.
what?
it's not my fault.
Mr. Langton.
I talked to Topher.
if there were anything you could do, I'd already have you doing it.
I didn't think remote wipes were even possible.
neither did we.
you retrieved the target item?
Yeah, I got it. So, how are you planning on getting her out of there?
we're working the problem.
what does that mean?
it means I'm hopeful of a happy outcome.
and if the outcome isn't happy?
then you should prepare yourself.
the crew's access point to the vault. Where is it?
uh, a security office.
draw me a map.
the place is a maze! I don't remember...
try.
how?
as if your life depended on it.
we believe, with the right equipment, you could get inside the building through the roof.
Oh, sweetie. Equipment's not the issue.
the gray hour's going to end in nine minutes.
we won't even make it out of the parking garage.
but if this echo chick is as good as you say, brain fry aside, I don't need to get inside.
all I need is a phone.
I like sky.
Yeah, the blue kind. You mentioned.
that's a mountain. - Yep.
what's my name? - Taffy.
when I'm there, my name is something else.
hand me that bag.
what are you looking for?
a way out of here.
not to play with.
there's an air duct back here.
he's gonna find a way out of here.
vitas isn't gonna open that door.
and I'm not gonna open that door.
and you're definitely not gonna open that door.
they are gonna open the door.
they're gonna take us to prison.
what's prison?
it's a place with no sky.
we're bad guys.
when bad guys get caught, we don't get to see sky.
I'm a bad guy?
you... are a talking cucumber.
and I'm... too broken to fix.
Oh, no, no, no. You don't get to take the easy way out!
I'm lifting the no-kill order.
when those doors open...
we're shooting our way out.
you think he's one of the prongs in the multi-pronged conspiracy?
he's always gunning for my job.
he loves the beach.
here.
you really think a programmer in Tokyo is going to remote-wipe echo in los angels to steal your job?
he shows Dewitt his mad skills, suddenly topher's no longer "number one son."
echo could die. That is not a plan for career advancent.
anyway, Takahashi's a hack.
there's only one person I know who could achie a remote wipe.
and he's dead.
you know this only works if he answers.
dial again.
keep dialing.
I'd like to go over the plan again.
nervous Nellie. He's actually kinda sweet.
Okeydoke.
the vault door contains a whole mess of glass re-lockers.
if somebody, me say, drills through the door from the inside, the glass breaks.
presto, alarm goes off.
whole other mess of locks are released.
no getting out.
you bypass the glass. - Resin.
makes it crack rather than shatter.
if you do it right.
well, this is about to be a giant anticlimax.
dial again.
it's over.
I don't like this room anymore.
where are the better rooms?
I have something in my pocket.
look.
it's over. - It's almost over.
the security system's going back online one device at a time.
the vault door, then the heat sensors, then the motion detectors.
Hello?
if I can get the vault door open before the motion detectors reactivate, we're all good.
is this the chowderhead?
I don't know.
clearly, yes.
here's the dealio.
I can get you out of that vault if you do exactly as I say.
can you do that?
I think so.
underwhelming, but let's give it a go.
you should be carrying a vial of resin.
bra's a good place.
I have it!
then you've also got a nozzle thingy tucked into your boot. Lipstick-like.
Yes!
screw one thingy onto the other thingy. And you're gonna need a drill.
she says we need a drill.
who's "she"? - I don't know.
but I'd give taffy the drill.
this is fun. Are you having fun?
no.
go to the door. You'll want both hands.
on three, start drilling into the door.
doesn't matter where.
ready.
I'm going to close my eyes and pray to god that when I say stop, you will stop.
one... two... three... drill.
and stop.
spray the resin into the hole-- three squirts. Count them out.
put the drill in the hole. Turn it on.
now, this is the important part.
do not move your hand.
don't think about it. Do it.
is that good?
Chowderhead! Talk to me.
this wouldn't have happened if you didn't give my job away.
what's the police response time?
seven minutes. Guards inside, less.
six minutes, 15 seconds less.
you stupid bitch!
taffy, thank you for your services.
that's it?
Mr. Dominic will take you down for your treatment.
thanks for the cash. Good luck with the girl.
I'll notify Boyd.
he may have to neutralize her.
no. I'm beginning to suspect he hasn't the proper distance.
send down for ramirez and Hutchins.
put them on standby.
I'm sorry.
me, too.
don't go anywhere with that. I've got my eye on you.
this may pinch.
the guards are closing in.
remember, your hands go over your head.
okay. Why?
cause you don't want the guards to put a bullet in your chest.
don't listen to him. Take this. Get up.
point it at the bad guys and you squeeze the trigger.
aren't we the bad guys?
down. Remember what I told you?
you get broken or you do the breaking.
come out slowly! Let me see your hands!
let's go!
start shooting now...
or I shoot you.
I'd like to go now.
let's see your hands! There's no way out!
drop the weapon!
do it.
building perimeter is locked down!
hands on your head!
do it now!
what are you waiting for? Do it!
around the corner... you can get out.
go.
go now; they won't be able to see you.
are you okay?
he's broken. Can we fix him?
we'll try.
I'm not broken.
no, you're not.
come on. Let's get out of here.
what took you so long?
there's a car out there.
two guys, motor on, 15 minutes at least.
this is west Hollywood.
two guys in an idling car isn't news.
so, who am I going to be?
uh, john smith, maybe?
I got a good American accent.
you're gonna be Anton Lubov.
I ... I don't get it.
I may have misled you about the "me helping you.
I needed you to stay put while I put you front and center on every "be on the lookout" list from here to new York.
if you try to leave los angels by plane, train, or automobile, the FBI is going to be all over you.
we won't be discreet.
I'll personally drop you off at the borodins' doorstep, make sure they know we're friends.
are you crazy? You want me to die?
I don't want you to die, but if you do, there's a lot to learn from a dead body.
I know how the Russians kill.
I know their favorite weapons. I know where to look for bruises.
I know which body parts they like to chop off and what message they want a body to send.
I tried to help you.
if your body turns up and tells a different story, well, then that'll give me information, too.
the FBI doesn't work like that.
you ... you can't do this.
I'm a screw-up, remember?
my ci shows up dead, nobody's going to blink.
nobody's going to care.
you put on your mean face, act tough, but yoll care, agent Ballard.
that's your problem.
I'm not broken.
around the corner, you can get out.
what are you waiting for? Do it!
aren't we the bad guys?
bitch!
is that good? - No, it's weak.
you either get broken or you can be the one doing the breaking.
that's what art's for: To show us who we are.
this one's broken.
did I fall asleep?
Hello, Echo.
how are you feeling?
did I fall asleep?
Michelangelo believed his sculptures already existed inside the marble, waiting to be freed.
we should get this to our clients first thing in the morning.
and the antiquities expert?
they can have him, too.
so...
I put echo through every test I could think of, which is a lot.
the remote wipe didn't do any permanent damage, so...
whatever happened...
in echo's head in that vault-- it's gone?
she's fresh as morning dew.
no pesky human evolution bits lingering around.
well done.
I believe victor has completed his debriefing.
he's ready to be wiped.
it was alpha, wasn't it?
nobody else could come even close to pulling off a remote wipe.
he's alive. He's out there.
you'll need to sign and initial at the bottom.
is this...
am I fired?
I'm upping your security clearance.
does that mean... I'm right?
alpha's alive? He's out there?
but after the...incident, you told us security tracked him down and, you know...
our influence is substantial, but alpha, with his gifts-- gifts we gave him
finding him, confining him-- we're not all-powerful.
I'm scared.
I'm scared like a little girl.
sign and initial at the bottom.
I'll tell you what I know about alpha.
you'll tell me how he did this and how we can keep him from ever doing it again.
it would've been polite to ask.
you have to get used to doing things my way, too.
see, these personality imprints, they come from scans of real people.
keep it down.
while this little darling and I get to know each other better.
wow, she's in.
Hey, neighbor. Off early?
Ooh, who's she?
nobody, according to the FBI database.
what the hell's the matter with you?
your little brainchild just backfired.
excuse you.
are you gonna pick that up?
Oh, how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way.
I'm talking to you! What, are you deaf? Or you just tone deaf?
Jesse, not in my shop, please.
not in your shop?
they wouldn't be in your shop if you refused to serve them.
no.
you know what they're doing up there on that compound.
no, I don't. Neither do you.
you just don't want to know.
osama Bin Ghandi, Huh, what do you need that for, huh?
or this?
look at me! Look at me when I talk to you!
all right, all right, enough! Get out of my store, Jesse.
trouble? - No.
no trouble.
it's weird. Their money spends just fine.
it's not so much the singing as it is the smiling.
what do you figure that's all about?
maybe they're just happy, Phil.
Yeah, maybe.
save me.
happy? No, this is something quite apart from happiness.
call it a kind of bliss, an unquestioning serenity.
true happiness requires some measure of self-awareness.
we're talking about people here who have their very wills taken away.
imagine such a thing.
the irony of bringing this to you, Adelle, is not lost on me, I promise you.
it's not the irony that concerns me.
you're asking me to place an active with a federal agency.
indirectly, yes.
I don't wish to be vulgar, but one of the many benefits of having you as a client is that you help us avoid entanglements with federal agencies.
senator.
it's the ATF.
you been running guns?
besides, your active won't be working with the government.
one of your security guys would liaise.
your active would be perfectly safe.
in a fanatical religious cult.
this is an election year.
I got the family value voters on the right, the women's issues constituency on the left all coming after me if anything untoward is going on behind those compound walls.
the ATF is convinced there is.
now, we have a very narrow window on this warrant.
if the government sends in some wet-behind-the-ears Quantico undercover graduate, these people are gonna know about it.
I need the real thing.
I need a true believer.
I can't help you. - You're the only one who can.
aren't you supposed to be shot?
I lived.
I see that. Shouldn't you be recuperating?
come on, Loomis. You scan the face, you look for a match.
computer does all the work.
have Carter run it through NCIC.
I already did that.
and you didn't get a match? - Nothing.
well, I don't know what you expect me to do.
we both know your clearance rating opens up databases Carter can only dream about.
then you know that I've got plenty of faces to scan for people much more impressive than you.
but not as charming.
was that flirting?
I think so. It's been a while.
did I mention I was shot?
I don't like it.
good, it's your job not to like it, Mr. Dominic, but Senator Boxbaum is more than just a valued client.
he's a well-placed asset.
denying his request would have a steeper downside than acquiescing.
it's not the job. I'm confident Langton can handle the ATF. It's Echo.
her field response has been wildly erratic lately.
she's demonstrated atalent for adaptability, which is precisely what is required in this instance.
they shouldn't be adaptable. They should be predictable.
if Alpha didn't teach us that much.
you don't like Echo, do you, Mr. Dominic?
it's not that I don't like her.
it's that sometimes I worry you do.
your objections have been noted. Thank you, Mr. Dominic.
Hello, Echo. - Hello.
I had an exam.
that's good. Would you like to have some lunch now?
I would.
she shouldn't eat.
not before the surgery.
echo, why don't you go have a massage?
a massage would be relaxing.
if she were any more relaxed, she'd be ooze.
so, it's doable?
it's experimental. And highly invasive.
but doable?
the actual procedure isn't much more complicated than laser eye correction.
it ain't brain surgery.
actually, it is brain surgery.
we're going to be turning Echo into a human camera, and in order to do that, she's going to have to be made blind.
not permanently.
in theory.
so, this is it?
Yes, uh, the latest in CSEVP.
cortical stimulation for evocation of visual perception.
brain camera for the blind.
or that.
and this is what she'll be seeing?
well, this is what the feds will be seeing, only less clear once we get it inside of Echo.
we'll be using her eyes as lenses.
the images will bypass her own cortex and be broadcast directly back to the ATF.
echo herself will see no evil.
there have been instances of this technology causing aneurysms and, in one case, death.
it's possible one good sneeze could bring on a seizure.
or even worse-- a sneezure.
the risks have been determined to be within acceptable margins.
how soon can she be ready?
I'll need 24 hours.
good. Clock starts now. Thanks.
this is our target. Calls himself Jonas Sparrow.
real name: Nathan Allan White.
36 years of age, spent most of those years in federal prisons.
last time he was inside, Sparrow claimed a conversion experience.
upon release, he joined up with the Zion Ranch.
formed a splinter group.
they grew in numbe and set up shop here.
what kind of shop?
given Sparrow's history, it could be anything from gun running to human trafficking.
one thing I can promise you: he is not up at that ranch putting hay in a manger.
until now, our problem has been we haven't been able to show cause for a warrant.
sparrow never leaves the compound himself.
but once a month, he sends some minions into town to buy supplies.
they go in groups to watch each other.
well, someone wasn't watching closely enough because one of the faithful managed to scribble this on the back of a shopping list.
save me.
these two words have opened a crack in the door.
a very small crack.
a judge has agreed to let us do a sneak-and-peek.
we have 48 hours to show cause for further action.
then the door shuts again.
48 hours to penetrate a closed group?
to gain their confidence, to get inside?
I'd like you all to meet Boyd Langton.
private contractor recommended to us by Senator Boxbaum.
he's been vetted at the highest level.
I'll let him tell you what he does.
Hi, so, what I do is I work with an extraordinary young woman.
she's not a law enforcement officer.
she's not an undercover agent. She's just a girl.
and she's going to help us.
her name is Esther Carpenter, and she knows these people.
she knows them like she knows herself.
did she escape from a cult?
no.
she didn't escape from anything.
Esther's talent is not in getting out, but getting in.
and because of this talent, because of who she is, that is what she will do.
she will not arrive there a stranger or an intruder.
she will walk through the gates of that compound, and she will be accepted as one of them.
how?
through a miracle.
I can feel the sun.
we're headed south now. You made the turn.
it means we're getting closer.
I really want to thank you for going out of your way.
it's not as far out of my way as you might think.
I admire your courage. Hitchhiking across country.
because I'm blind?
Nah, cause you're a girl.
I'm a girl?
wow, I've been blind longer than I thought.
do I hear a smile?
you do.
so, you weren't always blind?
no, the Lord saw fit to take my vision when I was nine.
the Lord, huh? And you don't blame him?
blame him? No, I praise Him.
saul of Tarsus made it all the way to Damascus after he was struck blind, and he became a new person.
you want to become a new person?
more than anything.
are we here?
I think so.
there's a gate. It looks like it's open. I could walk you there.
no, thank you. I made it this far.
is the path close?
open the door; you'll step right on it.
thank you.
and God bless you.
keep OUT
Hello?
Hello?
please... I know you're there.
I'd know your face anywhere.
you broke in? Okay.
so then here's what I want you to do.
bring the drugs to this address. You ready?
9000 Temple Street. Downtown.
I'll see you then.
that was my neighbor.
I forgot my pain medication at home.
she's gonna run it down here for me.
please tell me we've made some progress?
sorry. I tried every biometric I know.
your Caroline doesn't exist.
I'll leave it active and in the system, at least for now.
if I get any hits off the face recog, I'll let you know.
from Raymond, New Hampshire.
a blind hitchhiker.
and you got all the way here by yourself?
I was led by God.
and was that God in the car that dropped you off?
just one of his instruments.
who told you about this place, Esther Louise Carpenter?
you did.
I've never seen you before.
but I've seen you.
you appeared to me in a vision.
you spoke to me.
you said a place had been prepared for me.
you told me to walk out my door, to not be afraid.
you said, Come to your brothers and sisters at the Temple.
you said I would be carried here.
as if on the wind.
and then you took my hand, and you held it to your face so that I would know it.
Amen. - Praise be to God.
Hallelujah.
they're taking her inside.
as advertised.
we shall make a new garden, and fresh buds will flower there.
it's happening.
if she is what she says she is.
what else could she be?
brother Seth, I've told you how we must protect this garden.
there are those who would seek to destroy it; you know that.
Yes.
we are commanded to test all of the signs.
if a serpent should enter, we must crush it underneath our heel.
you understand that?
Yes, Jonas. - We must keep the garden pure.
hello.
good day.
the water is warm.
it feels nice.
Yes, it does.
it feels...
nice.
for my money, the Valsalva mechanism is really the way... way to go.
I got to go. Something came up.
doctor?
hello. - Hello.
so, listen. Here's the thing.
I was looking, glancing...
I noticed... Victor.
you noticed Victor.
in the shower, and he's... naked.
Victor's naked in the shower?
right. Anyway, he seemed to be having a kind of...
man reaction. - A what?
uh, you know, reaction that a man person might have in the...
you know, the naked part. Shower. Victor.
Victor had an erection?
I prefer man reaction. - Why?
this is a problem. This can't happen. It shouldn't happen.
when they're in their Doll state, there's a limpness.
well, I warned about something like this.
when?
his last engagement was with Miss Lonely Hearts.
so? That shouldn't matter.
I mean, okay, it was a romantic engagement, but he was wiped.
this is the eighth time he's had that exact imprint.
I've cautioned against repeated imprints in the same Dolls, haven't I?
I don't know. You put it in one of those reports?
of course. - Okay.
well, nobody reads those.
how many times has this happened?
I don't know. I wasn't looking for it.
well, now you're gonna have to.
let's start with the last three months of shower tapes.
we're actually gonna sit down and...
look for the...
man reactions.
this is Sister Emma.
sister Annabelle.
hello.
Oh, this...
hello.
Hello, Iilya.
it's a pleasure to meet you.
and what a handsome face.
thank you.
Iilya was with us at the Zion Ranch back in Texas.
you were unhappy there.
things happened there that should not have happened.
Jonas led us out of that place. - He saved us.
Esther, Jonas would like to see you.
another female, approximately 29 years of age.
let's tag her femme eight.
could be Andrea Parker from Florence, Texas.
you have some names? - Few.
been watching these people a long time.
any idea who our cry for help came from?
be nice to know who our ally on the inside is.
Yeah, it would be, but we can't presume any allies.
damn it!
what happened? We lose our signal?
the signal's still there. I'm just not getting... What the hell?
I'm going to ask you some questions, Esther, and I want you to be truthful with me, okay?
of course.
you work for the government?
what?
the federal government did they send you here?
no. Of course not.
and you're not with law enforcement of any kind?
no.
I want to believe you, Esther.
I want to believe everything you say.
it's a beautiful story.
but the serpent also had a beautiful story, and the woman was deceived, and the man was corrupted, and they were forced to leave the garden.
I don't understand.
I do not come into this garden a pure being, Esther.
I come into it the way Adam left.
broken. Corrupted. Impure.
but those whom I shelter... they are not corrupted.
they have not walked in the world the way I have.
they have not seen the things that I have seen.
and against this world, they are defenseless.
so I will protect them.
and any who seek to harm them, to foul this garden...
shall fail.
Iilya told me that you saved them.
all who are here are blessed.
welcome to the Temple.
she who was born for a time such as this.
welcome.
he is a great man.
Yes.
you getting this?
Oh, yeah. I'm getting it.
that's an arsenal.
I hope I got here fast enough. You're not in a lot of pain, are you?
Oh, here's your prescription.
also some leftover manicotti.
thank you. I really appreciate this.
no big. I've been meaning to come down here anyway.
you've been meaning to come down to the Federal Building?
well... you know.
uh, some guy in the hall asked me to give you this.
some guy in the hall?
Yeah. I was asking directions, and he heard me say your name.
I'm right, aren't I? Both were written by the same person.
give me a second.
and no postmark on either one.
Mellie, describe again the man who gave this to you.
uh, sure, he was maybe mid- 20s, um, not overly tall.
cute, brownish hair.
did he have a cart?
a cart?
uh, yes, yes, there was a cart there. I remember that.
was there mail on the cart?
uh, yeah, a lot of mail.
little Stevie from the mail room.
short, cute, brown hair, too lazy to walk to your desk.
that little bastard.
still, though, you're right: the handwriting's a match, so whoever sent you the photo sent this to you, too.
okay, hi, Mom. Are we done?
Oh, and the girls of Sigma Tau. Sisters forever.
wow, the photograph didn't really do her justice, did it?
let's hope those venereal diseases make you all sterile, you snobby- ass pack of hos.
this is real.
I mean, this is who she was... just a girl.
just a girl with a potty mouth.
Yeah, I probably should have thought about that. - Someone wanted me to see this.
can you roll it back?
Ditra and Meg, life without you will be meaningless and bleak, - my dormies. - Okay, well, uh...
I should probably get going.
okay, thanks again, Mellie.
let's hope those venereal diseases make you all sterile, you snobby-ass pack of hos.
let's roll that back, please. I believe I spotted a tumescence at 3: 21: 04.
tell me what you think.
Yeah, it ain't oak, but it's on its way to wood.
are we done?
go to Wednesday the 23rd, please.
you know, I could burn these and you could just take them home.
go back. There.
wait, freeze that. - I will not.
of course. If it'd been a snake.
please pretend I didn't say that.
G - Go back to 17: 57: 09.
can you zoom in to his face?
now jump to 24: 25: 14. Freeze.
well, I guess that rules out Miss Lonely Hearts.
I - It's not residual imprinting; it's her.
it's Sierra. - What?
it only happens when she's there, and it started not long after she arrived.
she's the new element that's been introduced to his environment, the catalyst to his physical response.
he likes her.
Yeah.
when we breach, forward team here.
we need to secure that arsenal.
you're going in now?
soon as my warrant comes through. Just waiting on the judge.
then I need to extract my associate.
sure. Why don't you go knock on the door, let them know we're coming?
are you nuts? Your girl stays put.
she's my eyes in there. - She's served that function.
she's provided enough evidence for you to keep your case alive.
now I would like to do the same for her.
in my judgment this action is premature.
your judgment?
look, I was told not to be too interested in where you and the girl really came from.
no problem, I'm not.
what I am interested in is putting Nate White
or Jonas Sparrow or whatever he's calling himself this week back where he belongs for good this time.
you know this guy. - Yeah, I know him.
no, you know him.
you used to be cop.
me, too. 12 years, Laughlin PD.
back then he wasn't calling it a church, and they were mostly underage girls.
we put him away for what was supposed to be forever.
forever turned out to be just shy of two years.
some judge decided he didn't like the way we handled the evidence.
so when this judge calls...
I'm not waiting.
this is Langton. I need your okay for a forced extraction.
echo... she's glitching on a government job. Damn it.
echo is fine. She has performed perfectly within parameters.
then what's the problem?
agent Lilly.
he's about to release the hounds of hell on that compound.
echo's imprint will not have prepared her for this.
do nothing. - What?
if you're worried about a glitch...
no extraction. Authorization denied.
in our book, the story of Esther is the story of a woman.
her father died when she was still in her mother's womb.
her mother died in childbirth.
what was so extraordinary about the Esther of the Book was her unique vision.
she could see things no one else could.
this was the essence of the Esther of the Book. Her ability to penetrate secrets, to pierce the darkness, to find the truths others could not.
our Esther, it seems, is no different.
she says I appeared to her in a vision.
all right. You all know me.
you know that I make no special claim to revelation.
I'm just a man, weaker than most, but my faith is not weak, and as I see this place and all of you through Esther's eyesher amazing eyes, which see things no one else can.
that faith is only strengthened.
brother Seth, would you bring our sister forward?
sister.
Esther Carpenter, are you prepared to forsake the world of men, to give yourself, your life, your fidelity, and your industry to your brothers and sisters of the Temple?
I am.
return to the garden.
a new beginning.
nobody move.
the grounds were rigged. Floods got tripped; we're made.
I need you with me.
I'm with you, Jonas.
hold your positions. Do not breach.
maintain perimeter.
brother Seth, guard the window. - What's going on? I don't understand. What's happening?
was this you? Did you bring them here?
who? I don't understand.
did you do this? Did you bring the wolves to our door?
Jonas, no, she's our sister. - Stop it.
the truth this time, Sister.
it's a miracle. I can see.
we're blind.
this is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
this is worse than Zion Ranch.
why does he have guns?
we have to trust him.
you must speak to them...
to your people.
they're afraid.
do you believe it, Seth? Do you believe in her?
I don't know. I don't know what to believe.
we took her into the dark; you put the light in her eyes.
there was nothing: no physical reaction, no change.
how do you fake that?
and yet she sees.
those men outside I know you didn't bring them.
I know you were telling me the truth.
they've come to destroy us, to raze the garden and to salt the Earth.
before, I looked into your eyes and I saw nothing, and so I believed.
and I look into them now...
and I need to know...
was this a miracle?
I was blind, but now I see.
then you were brought here for this purpose: so that I might know what to do.
and now I do.
you've got no way at all to communicate with her?
no, I really don't.
so my inside man is worthless, is what you're telling me?
she was never your inside man.
Oh, so she's just another one of them.
fine, that's how she'll be treated.
look, you do have someone on the inside whoever sent up that cry for help.
we should try to put a name to that, then at least maybe we can form a strategy.
we are not going to do anything.
you are not a part of this, not anymore.
Oh, great.
it is true.
below us is a cache of weapons Brother Seth and I have hidden there in the event that this day should ever come.
I prayed it would not, but I always knew that it would.
the darkness cannot abide the light.
and yet I now believe that my prayers were answered.
Esther was sent to us in advance of these men a demonstration of God's power.
so you will not take up arms.
you will not have to. Come with me.
a religious cult known as the Children of the Temple.
this was the scene today in Pleasant, Arizona...
where agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms surrounded this remote compound.
the sight of the armed agents caused widespread panic.
cult leader James Sparrow is wanted by federal authorities on unspecified charges.
I didn't see who wrote the note. It could have been any one of them.
there was a bit of a mishegas going on up at the front of the store at the time.
what kind of mishegas?
well, Jesse Dillard mechanic across the way there.
he followed them in here and he tried to, uh, provoke a thing there.
Why? - Well...
I mean, they are kind of odd, you know.
but, uh, you know, there's been a lot of rumors about what's going on up there at that compound.
now, I never believed any of them until I saw that note.
anyone check the security tape?
well, nothing was stolen and nobody asked.
we think he's moved everyone into this outbuilding here.
no, that's not where he's got the guns stored.
still, doesn't mean he can't get to them. There could be tunnels, underground access.
if there are tunnels, why he didn't use them to move his people?
why herd them out in broad daylight?
will you give us a moment, Carlos? - Yeah.
okay. You wanted to go in there and get your girl?
I'm open to letting you do that.
under a couple of conditions.
how about these conditions?
you stay the hell out of my way and maybe I don't tell anyone it was you.
you knew he sent his people into town once a month.
you were waiting. You ginned up tempers. Started rumors in the town.
created a diversion, and then you wrote that note.
that's how you got your warrant.
nobody ever asked to be saved. Not by you.
you're witnessing the wonders of the most high, Brother Seth.
do not lose faith. Now go. Go.
can you, uh, read? Sight- read?
it's been a long time. I was nine.
Yes.
read that for us.
then...
nebuchadnezzar ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than normal...
and commanded the strongest soldiers in his army to throw Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego into the fiery furnace...
we got movement on the grounds.
they're coming out?
just one guy.
is he a black guy?
...the furnacewas so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took them up.
king Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his men, " Weren't there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire" ?
and the King's men replied, " Certainly, O King" .
and the King said, "Look" !
I see four men walking in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.
nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, " Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the most high God, come out" !
so Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire, and the King saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed.
their robes were not scorched and there was no smell of fire upon them.
we have witnessed more than one miracle these last days.
prepare yourselves for the next.
No! No! No! I - I want to leave.
Kris, Kris, wait! Everyone, wait.
lose your faith, and you will perish.
those flames can't hurt us.
they'll protect us. Only the unrighteous will be consumed.
it's okay. Come. Sit.
thank you.
fire seems to be contained to our target building.
no. This might be a provocation. They might not even be in there
trying to draw us out.
all right. Fire gear. We move in. Same pattern.
this is not a rescue operation, not yet.
we're still here to serve a warrant. - Yes, sir.
that security consultant Langton.
I think he might have been working with Sparrow.
the security consultant? - Yeah, he may be our fire starter.
if he's gone in there, we take him down.
Jonas. Jonas, you have to let them leave here.
you have to tell them to!
Esther, where is your faith?
this isn't right. You can't force a miracle.
and he saw "that the flames did not harm their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed, and there was no smell of fire upon them" .
these people are going to die from smoke inhalation before the flames...
if that's what God wants. You pray.
let us pray.
go! - Esther!
what is wrong with you? You people are dying!
what have you done?
start taking these people out of here!
he swore to protect them! If he won't, we have to.
the blind girl is looking you in the eye. Do you know what that means?
it means God brought me here.
he has a message for you.
and that message... is "Move your ass!" Go! Come on!
Iilya, we have to go.
where will we go? - I don't know. But outside is life.
in here... no.
how can you doubt after God restored your sight?
Iilya, I don't think God let me see again so I could just watch.
our home is gone.
you got him? - Yeah. Come on, Iilya.
okay, go! Go! - Come on!
and he commanded them to purge the evil from their midst.
our trouble ends here.
we think he's still in there.
langton and the girl?
I don't know.
pull your men back.
I know you. How is that possible?
it's not.
I thought you were an angel.
of course we won't stop until we're sure we've found everyone, but...
the grim fact is we don't think there are any more survivors.
thank God.
you the AIC?
I was.
special Agent Ballard. FBI.
FBI?
little late to the party.
I see that.
the people you took out of here，where are they?
being debriefed and then released.
where?
look, another agency has a problem how this went down, you can take it up with my superiors.
I'm not gonna hand you the knife. - What?
no. I'm looking for this girl.
she look familiar?
she could be anybody.
look, unofficially, before you release these folks, just let me talk to them.
I don't do things unofficially. Get a warrant.
a place of safety, of untroubled certainty, of purity.This is the world we must maintain.
it is imperative that nothing disturb the innocence of life here.
once any temptation is introduced, it will spread...
like a cancer, and all will be infected.
Victor must be scrubbed and monitored closely.
so, tell me, Mr. Dominic. How was Arizona?
I understand it's a dry heat.
you requisitioned a company jet last night.
echo was glitching on a government job.
I felt I should be on- site in case measures were called for.
I see.
as always, just trying to protect your interests.
I'm touched. - If I may.
echo has been exhibiting the same signs Alpha did before his composite event.
now, if you're not willing to send her to the Attic...
don't gamble on what I'd be willing to do, Mr. Dominic.
take the stairs.
Hello, Echo. How are you feeling?
did I fall asleep?
for a little while.
shall I go now?
if you like.
how's your vision? Can you see okay?
I see perfectly.
there are three flowers in a vase.
the third flower is green.
agent Paul Ballard was suspended of duty, pending an investigation into the shooting of officer Harton.
I know at the beginning of the weekend, we said no strings.
we also said no ropes.
Yeah, I remember.
I remember it all.
I always will.
echo's off task.
your little brain child just backfired.
she's a risk. An increasing risk.
she had controled of the situation.
but we can't control her.
our trouble ends here.
I'm going to make you an offer.
I told you, all I want to be left alone.
we both know we're past that.
gee, what gave it away?
the big, black van?
or the being held in this room for two days with no frickin' idea where I am?
my offer is this.
your life... for your life.
I get five years, you get the rest.
you'll be free.
is that you talking?
or the Rossum corporation?
why me? Why did you pick me?
Caroline, you picked us.
this is a good thing, caroline.
I know what I saw.
what started this?
you and I have been doing this dance for almost two years.
I thought you'd have learned by now.
nothing is what it appears to be.
please, any hack can do a generative study.
any hack with two years and a 50-million-dollar lab at their...
Owen? - fly, be free.
fly. - Owen?
fly, be free.
Owen, you okay, buddy?
fly, fly! - Owen?
fly, fly!
Hey, Owen, it's us. - Fly, fly!
fly! - Owen? Owen, it's okay.
fly! Fly!
gravity's not the equation.
Hey, stop! Owen, stop! - Oh, my god!
that is one of only two existing vials of our most promising new memory drug.
the other vial is missing.
I don't need just one active on this.
I need an army.
I've already rearranged the schedule.
the boots are as good as on the ground.
if this is about foxtrot speaking mandarin instead of Cantonese, it was a - Topher. - very...Simple...
this is... - Clive Ambrose.
co-chairman of the, uh, Rossum corporation, third richest man in the country, nominated for a nobel prize.
I might throw up. That's a compliment.
something really bad happened.
there's been an incident at Freemont College.
he was a grad student at one of our premiere labs.
but not anymore.
Owen ingested a psychotropic modification of aphenethylamine compound.
one of the memory drugs Rossum's got in R&D?
it breaks down natural inhibitions in the hippocampus in order to awaken sleeping parts of the brain.
we're still in the experimental stage.
phase one of N-7316 manifests like a recreational narcotic.
giddiness, light hallucinations. - Munchies.
phase two apparently manifests as a complete loss of impulse control.
could be phases, could be...
a little thing I'd like to call body chemistry.
we're all our own little cesspools of hormones, enzymes, chemical reactions.
it's the same as any drug-- heroin, cocaine, caffeine, how your body reacts depends on a multitude of indefinable factors.
you snort horse once, don't like it, you go back to your organic tea, have a nice life.
I do it once, whoo, I'm doing two bags a day for 20 years.
one toot for you, adios, amigo.
that's what's so exciting about drugs!
not that I'd know.
we do biweekly drug tests.
just pure scientific observations.
how did the drug find its way into the general campus population?
we don't know. Maybe owen was selling it.
maybe he or someone else put it in the soda machine in the dining hall.
one vial is enough to take out the entire student body.
no antidote floating around, I'm guessing.
right now the best we can do is sedation.
we're hoping you can help us do better.
while you work on an antidote, a team of actives will secure the campus and try to locate the missing vial.
Oh, right. They'd be immune.
how did you know that?
all right, this baby attacks the inhibitors in the hippocampus to break down the repressed memory blocks, right?
actives don't have them. Stuff would bounce right off them.
think you can help us, Mr. Brink?
well, I can't hurt.
probably.
start with the imprints and get the actives in the field.
if you need any extra help, cool.
echo's on an engagement, right?
Yeah, old client, new fantasy. I should call her back in?
no, she can sit this one out.
wow, I've never seen anything like it.
it looks like a dragon. Is that stupid?
uh, here.
Oh, no, thank you.
Alice, you're going to drive this bike.
I am? - Yeah.
you're gonna do a lot of new things today.
okay!
are you making breakfast?
it's kind of late, but since I'm a gentleman of leisure, and you've taken up professional sleeping.
didn't know I could cook, did you? - Nope.
good. Then you won't be disappointed when you find out I can't.
Paul, listen.
take those off 'cause they're done. And listen.
I'm a grown-up person. We've got...impulsive and five minutes later, someone nearly killed me in your apartment.
I know you feel an obligation... - That is not what...
I don't think you don't like me.
but we don't fast-forward to the honeymoon just because I had a bad day.
I like taking care of you.
I'm glad. I think you're dreamy.
but in my dream, I'm stronger than you know.
I think you proved that when you... - that was luck.
I'm not a prize fighter. That russian thug had two left feet.
I wish he had.
it would have been a lot easier to id a guy with two left feet.
they did id him.
they got a name which I guarantee you wasn't his.
I took a set of prints myself, though.
got a friend who can access a few databases outside of the bureau's reach.
the dollhouse found this guy somewhere. Professional killers are made.
they're trained.
I'm sorry. You don't want to talk about this.
you're off the case. - Officially.
they suspended you!
so far as the dollhouse is concerned, I'm not a threat anymore.
this is the perfect time...
you can't drop it.
you said you thought this was important.
and they tried to kill me!
Mellie, I promise you...
you can't promise!
it's blind luck that I'm not dead already.
what you can do is drop the case .
let someone else handle it.
Yeah, you love taking care of me.
I think you know your way across the hall.
go.
all right, take those. We're going to do the grid.
six guys and girls, women-- searching this campus top to bottom.
I want that other vial.
Tom, this is Dr. Gawa from the center for disease control.
super. I haven't heard a good flesh-eating-strain-of-something horrible story in a while.
Yeah, I've got dozens.
hopefully today won't be worth talking about.
let's find these kids and get them better.
I've got you set up at the kappa zeta chi house.
and, tom, you'll be running the grid.
uh, the grid's taken care of.
I'll be too busy rounding up our day-trippers to look under mattresses.
that's my call. - Actually, it's mine.
you're NSA?
which outranks Rossum private security by more than a whole bunch.
all right, fine, I'll stay here and be the communications command post.
first have someone show Dr. Gawa to kappa house. You good?
Yeah. I've always wanted to go to a frat party.
are you sure you're okay?
I'm okay, if you're okay.
I'm great! Is that terrible?
no, it's wonderful.
I'm not sure how to work this, but... - okay.
Oh, god, what if somebody sees it?
only us. Okay, my life on it.
I never thought I'd...
Oh, I've lost picture. Sorry.
no just, uh... on the side. There's a button.
the tragic suicide appears to be a case of the stressed-out student who didn't know how to ask for help.
freemont college officials said that counseling will be available on campus throughout the week.
I have to go. I have to help him.
Alice, is everything all right?
I'm terribly sorry. I have to go.
Yeah, very funny. - I have to get him out of there.
okay, it's not actually that funny!
that was a door.
you know what I want to do tonight?
let's drive to that thing up north.
as you know, we don't have to go to every antiwar demonstration in the state.
Yes, we do. - I love you.
I love you.
are you comfortable?
Yes, thank you.
I'm going to give you a shot.
and then I just need you to sit still for a while.
can you do that?
if you like.
just think about pretty things. Rainbows.
she's immune, but dosing her will help me find an antidote.
all righty.
let's see exactly what this stuff is doing so we can undo it.
this may take a while. Be patient.
what shall I do, think about rainbows?
go for it.
or shall i think about how that glorified dog's body, Clive Ambrose, can't keep his affairs in order?
you could have said no.
the Rossum corporation is why we exist.
and I believe in the work we're funding.
I also believe that the only reason I don't have Clive Ambrose's job is 'cause he couldn't handle mine.
so, now we're sharing.
can you just figure out a way to keep people from killing themselves on this drug?
we have more than a few in the early stages, and sedating them is hardly a cure.
it'll buy me time.
as long as we keep the place locked down and don't have any more factors, then here I come to save the day.
Yeah.
can you get me a juice box?
are you lost?
no.
do you go to Freemont?
I don't know.There's parts that seem...
I... I don't know.
you can come with us. We got one more.
where are we going?
no, I don't know anything is wrong.
maybe that's the client's new fantasy.
send a doll to college.
well, which college?
uh, Freemont. I tracked Echo here.
Oh, please god, be joking.
Why? What's up?
your brain rocks!
we have a major engagement happening there.
echo cannot interfere with it.
get her out of there quickly.
and if you need assistance, call Dominic.
do you understand?
hold on. Yes?
there are mansions in your eyes. Did you know that?
you can see the doors...
excuse me.
no, I definitely don't understand.
I don't think I'm supposed to be here.
sit down. I'm just going to give you a little shot. Sit down.
the television made me. I had to come here.
a shot of what exactly?
you ingested a powerful narcotic.
I need to make sure you don't hurt yourself.
Oh, Matt and I don't do drugs.
I have somewhere to be, not here.
just relax.
what do they need babies for?
Rossum. No!
I don't think she wants the shot.
look, I'm not on drugs!
the window glass. It's coming for us.
fine. I'll get you the liquid gel. You, too.
don't worry. It wears off. I mean, I'm starting to feel normal again.
sort of. The walls stopped moving.
I'm not supposed to be here. I have to save him.
who?
I love you.
I don't know.
I have to get into Rossum.
the Rossum lab? This about Owen? What do you know about Rossum?
just that I have to get into the building.
you know, I think they did this.
put something in the water, using us as guinea pigs.
guinea pigs?
well, yeah I mean, I'm guessing that we're all nice, neat entries in someone's lab journal.
you know, uh, this many affected, is many hurt...
gone.
they killed my friend.
I have to get to the lab.
good luck. I mean, it's surrounded by security guards.
no, I can get in.
I just have to listen to myself.
you're serious? - Yeah.
I know a way in, I... I think.
which kind of freaks me out.
okay, well, I'll help you. I mean, I know that lab like the back of my hand.
Oh, no. You don't have to do that.
well, I'm not gonna let you go in there by yourself.
anyway, it's not just for you.
I mean, I wan to find evidence, prove they did this, and get their asses sent to jail.
I'm Sam. I think I'm glad I met you.
Alice. - We got to get out of here.
stuff! It's all too big!
No!
that worked. Thank you.
let's get out of sight, okay? Come on.
would you like to have a treatment?
no.
did not maintain control of that situation.
I don't want to say evil?
Yeah. Yeah, you really do.
Oh, the Rossum corporation is evil.
minds matter.
this guy gives me the heebie-jeebies.
clive Ambrose, the face of Rossum.
marketing campaign that big-- he's hiding something.
that whole company's hiding something.
Yeah, for instance, animal testing.
I mean, monkeys, puppies. They're torturing them.
kicking it mengele-style, all in the name of science.
monkeys should not be guinea pigs.
guinea pigs should not be guinea pigs.
whatever they say in those ads, the ends don't justify the means.
I have a plan. I have the beginnings of a plan.
is this when you free all the monkeys, and they go nuts and bite you to death?
no. This is where we film the monkeys in their cages and put the footage online.
Yeah, where millions can view it over and over again.
they'll be shamed into policy changes.
and we get in... how?
I mean, Rossum's got to have security.
I'm working on that part.
this is not how we used to party.
I spent four years partying in the shadow of that building.
do you know what they could have done in there in four years?
how many living creatures they...
someone has to stand up.
it doesn't have to be you guys. I wouldn't ask it.
this is just where I am.
Yup.
that's my girl. That's my caroline.
none of this is tagged. Get on all of this.
nothing yet, Sir.
well, I don't have to tell you to keep looking, but... Keep looking.
sure. Now you're experts.
four hours ago, you were discussing your love for apple sauce.
well, my guys have got this fairly well-contained.
14 subjects exhibiting erratic behavior, sedated.
what? - We rounded up 14...
you okay? - I'm fine.
go on. Four... 14 round what?
buddy? How about we head over to containment?
I'm fine.
Dr. Gawa will give you a light sedative...
Hey, I'm fine. - All right. Easy, buddy.
I know how to solve problems.
you bet.
Oh, man, this is so heavy. It makes my arms tired.
want me to help you out with that?
okay, here we go.
it's... it's so heavy. - Right.
extremely. Everything's heavy.
Yeah, I need to speak to the person in charge at the security office.
I see.
please, do keep me updated.
and please take care of him. Thank you, agent.
this is unbelievable.
what part was believable before?
the drug.
it's not being sold, Topher.
the effects are spreading. Mr. Dominic is exhibiting erratic behavior.
he didn't take any.
there's no way Dom would consciously try and have fun.
it could be air borne.
we'd be seeing a lot more cases on the campus. Beyond even.
exposure to a patient, whether viral, or through touch...
that spreads more slowly, but pretty soon, that campus is gonna fill up with wacky time bombs.
well, we need to know what it is.
Yes, well, we will...
when I figure it out.
and reversing the effect? You making any progress?
I'm working! What are you doing besides being...
being what? - Wait a minute.
sarcastic? Unfeeling? British?
it's an animal. - Where?
No! The word!
still, you have to admit, I am... very... British.
I don't say hard rs.
you know what I like? Brown sauce.
what's it made of?
science doesn't know. - It's made of brown.
brown... mined from the earth by the hardscrabble brown miners of north brownderton.
Oh, my god!
I find lentils completely incomprehensible.
what the sun-dappled hell is Echo doing at Freemont?
that's got nothing to do with the drug.
which means, our problems are huge and indomitable.
I could eat that word. Or a crisp. Do you have any crisps?
you haven't seen my drawer of inappropriate starches?
come on. Oh, my god, I'm having such a terrible day.
well, sorry, it's not much, but the, uh, scholarship doesn't cover a decorating fee.
it's nice.
so, you used to go to school here?
no. I went back east. I think. I mean, I did. I went to Colby.
okay. So, someone you know went here. A boyfriend?
I don't know.
I mean, I woke up this morning, and everything was normal.
and then, I met Matt, and... we did stuff.
and then, I saw the Rossum building on TV, and I had to leave, and...
and I can't really deal with a lot of questions right now.
Yeah. It's been a, um... weird, bad day. Say no more.
okay, so... we are here, and...
Rossum building is here.
the lab is on the second floor.
that's where I save him.
well, Alice, I don't want you to expect too much. There may not be a "him."
there might not be the proof against Rossum you're looking for, either, but that's not stopping you.
nothing stops me-- my mother's voice is too loud in my ear.
mama's boy.
I ain't got no choice. I'm all she's got.
so, you remember how to get in this building?
underneath. That's the way in.
okay, you're not overwhelming me with specificity.
we have toind Lily Foundry.
listen to me carefully.
I've got a huge phalanx of machines that go ping, and this is carried by anyone exposed to it. Through touch.
it is mandated that you get any Rossum operatives off the grounds and send them back here.
say hi for me.
Nope, you dolls, you're...
by which, of course, I mean NSA, CDC folks...
you're safe as houses.
because of the government.
they do things.
but anyone else who comes in contact with the drug is susceptible.
am I sure?
I am fairly sure.
secret agent Vctor is so lofty.
I have a good story about him.
hold on. Hold on. I have a ...
I have another call. I have another call. I have a better call.
Boyd! Did you find Echo?
what...
did you find Echo?
it's all right, Ms. Dewitt. I've, I've worked it out.
worked out what? Is Echo contained?
just listen.
it's around here somewhere.
you mean she's around here.
I don't think it's a person. I think Lily Foundry is an it.
so, we're looking for an it?
Caroline. Caroline Farrell!
excuse me?
I knew that was you.
that's not me. I'm sorry.
professor Janak.
we charted the whole history of the americas together.
her name is Alice, but have a good day.
I don't know this person, do I?
I know, she's... she's tweaked. She needs to be sedated.
we make choices.
I'm well aware that there are forces beyond our control, but even in the face of those forces, we make choices.
and then we live with them.
and then we die with them.
I know why Echo went to Freemont.
to punish you?
to let Caroline punish me.
are you ever gonna shut up about her?
is she what you think about when you're in me?
would you let me die, Paul? Would you be relieved?
you said it didn't affect them.
she's not tripping. She's glitching.
she's remembering.
there are three flowers in a vase.
the third flower is green.
there are three flowers in a vase.
then my Odyssey takes me to the city clerk's office, where, it turns out, the counter jockeys aren't opposed to a little "you scratch my back with a wad of cash, and I scratch yours with sealed planning records.
and voil?
blueprints. I'm riveted.
you are a snide bitch.
I know-- I love that about me.
me, too. - Well, these look like...really boring building plans.
Yeah, the first two hours I stared at them, but then I saw...
nice work, babe.
Yeah, I'm totally in the dark here.
well, they put in these utility tunnels here.
Yeah, but according to these plans, the room they lead to is empty.
so, if you wanted to, say, move things in and out of the lab without opening the front door...
you'd go in here.
babe... this is good news. Where's your happy face?
Rossum is seriously powerful, and this just... this just became real.
well, it's always been real to me.
Caroline, I'm just saying you might not want to piss them off.
Rossum is exploiting animals in the name of "science," and god knows what else.
I might want to piss them off a real lot.
okay, okay. Go easy. I'm not backing out.
you'd better not back out. - I'm with you.
damn right. - Always.
the entrance is here somewhere.
okay, we're nowhere near the Rossum building, and I checked all the directories for all these buildings, stand ill no Lily Foundry.
because you're standing on her.
there. We... we follow the red pipe.
I've been here before, but how can you not remember something and remember it at the same time?
that's just the drug making you act weird.
no. I felt it before. It pulled me here.
well, maybe you're crazy.
do you think so?
what I do think is, when we get in there, we have to look for lab books, uh, logs, chemical samples, proof that Rossum is responsible for this mess.
right there.
that goes straight into the Rossum building.
Yeah.
okay, we're gonna have to move like ninjas from here on out.
we're not gonna have to fight, are we?
because I don't even really know how to make a fist.
not if we do this right.
okay, so the staircase to the lab is just beyond the lobby.
now, timing is everything.
just pretend like we're playing a video game, and I'm gonna go first.
and when he turns his back, then you go.
I don't play video games.
you.
I am so sorry that I tried to kill you.
it's okay.
no, it's not okay.
I tried to burn you to death. Who does that?
what's the holdup?
he says he tried to kill me.
he's been exposed.
it's okay. Really, uh, whatever you think you did, come over it.
you know, uh... water... bridge... under.
please, I'm begging you, don't walk away. I just... I need your forgiveness.
you got it.
you don't mean it. You still hate me.
I could see it in your eyes, right, and you just keep looking at me with them.
I mean it. I forgive you.
look, the guns, right, the running around, the barking orders.
this is not all there is to Lawrence Dominic.
no, ma'am, this is just my job.
I'm not just hard edges. I mean, look at me. Check this suit out.
I'm not just hard edges.
how many times have I told you?
he's not a nice doggie. I don't want to pet him.
Mr. Dominic?
Mr. Dominic.
I, uh, hear you're feeling a little under the weather.
I think I might have something that might help.
he's not a nice doggie. I don't want to pet him.
he'll attack me.
all right.
everybody with a firearm, turn it in, now.
right here!
let's get our friend sedated.
you remember to be very quiet during the game, right?
noise is upsetting.
lift up your dress.
stay away from me.
no, it's okay, it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. We got to move now.
let's go... please.
it's not... a fun game. Please, stop.
we got to move now. Please, wait. Listen, wait!
soft. Like a kitty.
I don't hear anything.
she didn't finish the trigger code.
she's probably right as rain.
go check.
I am your superior!
in every way.
go check.
he dumped the stock.
he ran out of options.
help me get her into the chair.
I can't deal.
help me get her into the cir.
you need to wipe this out of her.
it doesn't make any sense.
then you make it make sense.
you think I float around like a balloon, untethered to your muck?
flip.
I run this house.
no, no. It doesn't make any sense.
except... actives' brains aren't like ours.
I mean, we atler them this way and that, so...
n seven three... blah, blah, blah...
it hit the actives later, all right?
and differently. Like... a memory glitch.
which means...
the compound is breaking down into a protease and zipping right through our man-made memory blocks.
november glitched to a traumatic memory.
I bet the same thing is happening to the other dolls.
upside is the drug's devolving.
a couple hours, it will be gone.
how do you explain the man who lost his brain down his shirt?
had an extreme dose.
way more than you can absorb.
way more than he would have taken.
it's a murder.
it's different.
yeah? What did it used to be like?
I don't know.
right where I left it.
I have to stop him.
who?
something awful.
is that the drug? You found it.
you found it really fast.
I'm sorry. Look, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.
we're in.
Leo, over here.
what do they need babies for?
this is Rossum.
they don't care about souls.
human or animal.
what are they doing to you?
are you getting this?
babe? You got to see something.
what is it?
science fiction?
they're not just experimenting with animals.
babe, we got to get footage of...
are they...
what the hell are they doing?
something really not good.
I told you Rossum was evil.
here. Take this. You get the animals. I'm gonna see what I can find in here.
Yeah.
look at her. Do we have to just leave her here?
babe, it's not a pet shop. We can't take them with us.
don't move!
go! Run!
what... did you do?
make it stop. Please.
I'm sorry about this, okay?
I didn't want to do this, any of this.
all these people-- why did you hurt them?
this right here is my chance for something.
Owen and me were gonna take this over to BelMed Tec.
in switzerland?
it's the number two drug company in the world right after Rossum.
you know what they'd pay for this?
billions.
you're insane.
nobody's perfect.
you do love a fight.
so we're going?
you're a killer.
listen, Owen is my best friend.
and him dying-- I didn't want that.
I just wanted to get him out of the way long enough for me to get out of town.
I didn't know he'd hurt himself like that, okay?
he knew what you were going to do.
it was his idea.
and then he got scared, said Rossum would come after us.
he tried to stop me.
just because you didn't mean it doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
you're responsible.
you think about it your way, and I'll think about it mine.
enjoy your trip.
no.
here...
leave it! Leave it! - No!
leave it! - Go!
No!
you're a killer, Sam. You killed him!
I love you, and you're gonna be okay.
Oh, my god. Come on, we have to get out of here.
okay, okay.
Oh, hey, again, so sorry about the burning alive.
stay with me. I need you! Leo, please!
I'm your girl. Leo. Please, Leo!
Leo, stay! Please stay!
get off of me, you crazy bitc Echo? would you like a treatment?
Yes.
ms. Dewitt, I'm glad you could come.
you seemed quite confident she fits the profile.
Yes. She's been through a lot.
well, you were right to call.
she was just here.
she won't get far.
Mr. Dominic, please come in. - Thank you.
would you like a drink?
no, thank you.
all the actives have been evaluated and processed.
everything seems satisfactory.
wonderful news.
yours, I believe.
Yes. Uh, thank you.
the, uh, press is running with the story we sold them.
student drugs classmates before committing suicide.
and Echo?
I suppose you'll be recommending she be sent to the attic.
that's entirely your call, ma'am.
for god's sakes, quit calling me ma'am.
we got drugged. We behaved like idiot children.
it happens. It's over.
you may go.
were you gonna say anything?
I just need to get away.
it's not forever.
I get it. I'm sorry.
Debbie might crash here sometimes, if you hear a noise.
if you need to reach me... - you know what?
maybe it's better if I don't know where you are.
in case. - Yeah.
okay. Okay.
you know where I am.
this should help you relax.
well, I don't want to relax.
I want the hell out of here.
I understand. - You can't hold me.
you have to have cause, evidence.
I'm not with the government.
well, then who the hell are you?
I'm someone who can give you what you want.
and what do I want?
a new life. A better life.
your mother, Antoinette Jennings of 483 Hellena street.
I understand she's experiencing some financial difficulties.
in fact, she's about to lose her home.
do not threaten my mother.
quite the opposite.
once you sign these papers, your mother will begin receiving a monthly stipend large enough to solve her financial problems.
it will continue for five years, and at t end of that time, you will be quite capable of supporting her all on your own.
how?
I'm going to make you an offer.
his last engagement was with miss lonely hearts. - So? That shouldn't matter.
I've cautioned against repeated imprints in the same doll.
there are three flowers in a vase, the third flower is yellow.
and our sleeper active performed perfectly.
were you gonna say anything?
I just need to get away.
the dollhouse is real.
they know you're after them. That's why they sent me.
we have a person inside.
what's happening?
she made a mistake. Now she's sad.
everyone thinks it's about the pain.
it's not about the pain. It's about trust.
handing yourself over fully devote completely to another human being.
there's nothing more beautiful than letting go like that.
in my experience, that kind of trust always leads to pain.
then maybe you need a session in my dungeon so I can show you otherwise.
Thanks. I think I'll pass.
don't be so vanilla. You can trust me.
I've already shown that I trust you.
I got in the van, didn't I?
you sure that was a wise decision?
I have a good feeling about you, and I've got the whip.
if you reconsider, I have an opening after my treatment.
don't even start.
I've got him on another lonely hearts engagement.
what's that make, nine? - Ten.
how pathetic is that old bag?
Ramirez pretends to be jaded but she's got a secret stash of bodice rippers in the van.
I've seen it. - Not true.
she wants to be kidnapped by a pirate.
I know a guy...
well, if i weren't madly in love with katherine, I'd shanghai you myself.
I'd take s and m barbie over him any day.
come on. Your geriatric princess awaits.
it's love. Show some respect.
sometimes it is about the pain.
Hi, echo. How are you?
did I fall asleep?
for a little while.
shall I go now?
if you like.
okay, oh!
Ivy, babe, the post-imprint script may seem inconsequential, but it's the first thing an active hears after a memory wipe.
it's got to be pleasant.
not so... - out of the chair, echo.
that. - You're behind schedule.
somebody's a grumpeteer today.
what's the holdup?
you remember how saunders little drill ended with a bullet in my computer?
guess what that does?
it slows down the schedule.
fix it.
you need to get to your appointment with dr. Saunders.
aside from topher being topher, everything's under control.
and I'll expect you to keep it that way while I'm gone.
did rossum tell you why they're calling you in?
considering our recent track record,
I' m sure they want to pat me on the head and tell me I' ve been running a crackerjack operation.
maybe there'll be cake.
ma'am, none of these incidents were your fault.
on the contrary, mr. Dominic, everything that happens under this roof is my fault.
and for the next 48 hours, it yours.
Hello, november.
Hello, echo. How are you today?
I'm going to dr. Saunders.
e's nice.
november, it's time for your treatment.
take a deep breath for me, please.
any permanent damage?
these exams are private.
her last engagement seemed unnecessarily rough.
she was a dominatrix. I think that's the point.
I prefer engagements that aren't about some...
deep, dark sexual need?
you really think it has anything to do with need?
sometimes, yes.
having a desire you're afraid or ashamed of expressing can be terribly debilitating.
look how many same-sex engagements we're called for, even today.
and sadomasochism isn't anything like...
I know. It's all about trust.
but what if the client has the whip?
mm, you don't send the actives to be submissives.
man, you got the pitch down.
you should fill in for dewitt.
I believe the system is flawed, maybe irreparably, but maybe not for the same reasons you do.
echo, you're all done here.
you can go now.
in about two minutes, I'm gonna make a call to dewitt.
if you were to do something, maybe get some air, maybe run,
I wouldn't know that you had done that.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
you don't?
I found this in the chair.
And?
this chip let someone access the primary imprint protocol, which means they could have altered my imprints.
I make a cheerleader, they make a cheerleader that shoots people.
or an assassin that does cheers.
or any active, any time, with a parameter we don't know about!
we have a spy?
inside the dollhouse.
and you think it's me? You think I'm the spy?
not in a bad way.
if they find out that you talked to me before you called dewitt, they'll fry you.
Yeah, I didn't really think that through.
thank you.
Hey, I'm boned anyway.
I call dewitt, she's going to take it out on dominic, and who's dominic gonna take it out on?
now echo's drawing attention to us!
where do I know her from?
maybe you should go to art class.
and maybe you should call dewitt. - Yeah.
echo, are you finished with your tree?
put the entire house on lockdown.
no one comes or goes without my authorization.
no land lines, no cell phones or network connections.
you. Come on. You're getting a treatment.
that's not happy! - Is everything a joke to you?
you allowed a security breach to develop on your turf.
you're supposed to make sure everybody who works here is on our side.
who has access to the lab? - The short list?
when I was in the agency, you know what I'd do toomeone who exposed us like that?
I'd kill him.
everyone' s unhappy today.
somebody put her tiny little thinking cap on.
he was mean to you.
were you not your best?
if it hadn't been for me, there'd still be a security breach.
you'd think the security head would recognize that.
typical middle - management hack.
he's mad at me for not discovering it before it happened.
but, uh, I'm not a counterintelligence agent, so I can't catch a spy.
and you have no idea what I'm talking about.
I can help you.
why would you want to?
why wouldn't I?
did I just lose an argument to a doll?
okay, um... thanks, but you can't help.
you make people different.
you can make me help.
im hello, mellie. How do you feel?
I'm jet- lagged. It's the last time I take the red- eye.
and in an emergency exit row behind a crying baby.
so, we good to go?
hang on. Let me double- check the primary protocol just to be sure it took.
where do I know her from?
come on. The airport shuttle's waiting to take you home.
Mellie? I heard something in...
in the hallway, where your neighbors walk to their apartments?
I didn't know you were coming back so soon.
surprise. - It's not safe to talk out here.
I guess the neighborhood went to crap while I was gone.
not the neighborhood. My apartment.
the dollhouse had it bugged. Video and audio.
took a while for me to figure it out, but I found a transmitter in the ventilation.
I should search your apartment.
I'm surprised you didn' t.
well, I was going to let myself in, but...
no. No, it's okay.
you should check, I' m just going to stay here, where I' m safe from the dollhouse.
I guess you didn' t miss me that much.
the dollhouse is way bigger than I ever thought it was.
every time I look deeper, I find more clients, larger amounts of money and a web of financial and political connections all over the world to corporations, the government, even inside the fbi.
I take it you haven't gotten your badge back.
but that's just scratching the surface-- I discovered something else.
I think that the dollhouse is underground.
didn't we know that? Supersecret underground organization?
not underground like it's a secret.
underground like it's somewhere beneath los angeles.
Yeah, you didn't come back to listen to this.
I came back to see you.
I'm sorry. It's just...
you should go back to your mother' s.
I can' t. Aside from the obvious reasons, like she lives in iowa and likes toet mup with losers I dated in high school,
I realized that I was running away from my life.
I'm giving you an out.
you can walk out that door.
I'm pretty sure I can't even unlock it.
I'm serious. I can't sleep.
the only thing I think about is finding this place, and sometimes,
I don't even know why I'm after it anymore.
that's why you need someone to help you stay grounded.
how are you going to do that?
let's start with getting you in sho thewer.
too much? Too fast?
do I smell that bad?
I have a message for you from inside the dollhouse.
that's not funny. - My name is november.
Mellie. Your name is mellie.
we knew this would be hard for you to hear.
if you're pissed because I'm still investigating the dollhouse...
this body belongs to a doll. - Just tell me. Don't do this.
I'm sorry we had to deliver the news to you like this, in this body, but the dollhouse has likely discovered that we've been placing messages in their imprints.
and this is the only way we could get the message to you.
they did this to you.
they did this long before you met me.
they've been using this body to spy on you for months.
the only reason mellie exists is because of you.
aren't I special?
now that you' ve removed their surveillance, they' re going to rely on her.
don't tell her anything about the investigation.
it will get back to the dollhouse.
that's why you-- she-- came back.
now you understand how dangerous their technology is.
I slept with her.
I should have known.
you can't tell mellie about this.
if the dollhouse knows you know, they will kill you.
and they'll make mellie do it.
Mellie couldn' t.
she's not a regular doll. She's a sleeper.
with the flip of a switch, the dollhouse can turn her into a killer.
if our person inside has been captured, - wait.
this is the last time you'll hear from us through a doll.
you can't tear apart my life and not give me anything.
where is the dollhouse located?
you need to investigate why it exists.
is it underground? Am I on the right track?
the dollhouse deals in fantasy, but that is not their purpose.
investigate their purpose.
we will find other ways to contact you. - Who? Who sent you?
I'm not imprinted with information you're not supposed to have.
tell me who! - Remember, you can't tell her.
- Wait!
Paul, what's wrong?
nothing.
then why aren't you kissing me?
my men have been trying to reach dewitt. She's still not picking up.
she going to be able to pull it off?
I threw my best secret agent parts into the build.
the gps on dewitt's cell transmitter isn't registering, either.
anything happened to dewitt...
think happy thoughts.
that's not happy. - Is everything a joke to you?
notice I'm not laughing.
you need me to take care of this?
you allowed a security breach to develop on your turf.
not my department, mr. Head of security.
you leave these doors wide open, computers on, chair running.
it's your job to make sure everybody that works here is on our side.
who has access to the lab? - The shortlist?
Dewitt, boyd, ramirez, saunders, ivy, any number of handlers or attendants.
and the occasional doll wanders up here.
then there's that janitorial staff.
what's going to happen when the boss lady comes back?
her wrath is going to rain down on me.
and then I'm coming after you. Let's go.
when I worked at the agency, you know what I'd do to someone who exposed us like that?
I'd kill him.
who is our target?
we found nsa tech in our equipment.
dewitt's known they've been sniffing around the dollhouse for years.
getting access to their files is our best shot at finding the spy.
tall order.
Oh, if you don tnk you can pull it off... - I didn't say that.
I just want you to appreciate how awesome I'm going to be when I deliver.
topher broke their rsa encryption, but only for the internal network.
which means you need me to get inside their building. - Yeah.
where could a girl get changed around here?
excuse me. Can I borrow a pen?
never mind.
found one.
3q - 3q don't worry. It's taken care of.
enter your private key. You know the drill.
20 minutes. Nothing goes in, nothing comes out.
your card will unlock the files you're cleared to see.
excuse me, ma'am.
I'm going to have to ask you to step over here.
did I leave something in there? - Hold out your arms.
Mossad doesn't even double- tag.
security alert.
all employees return to designated scif areas for level one security sweep.
security alert.
all employees return to designated scif areas for level one security sweep.
sorry, ms. Sato. We're moving everyone from scif offices down to the central lobby.
just give me a sec. - All right.
security alert.
all employees return to designated scif areas for level one security sweep.
I need a roof extraction, north end of the building.
there she goes.
im - Good morning. - Welcome back, roger.
Katherine's looking forward to seeing you.
may we go now? - Of course.
have you been futzing around with the equipment? It's been running s-l-o-W.
um, I just got here.
it's probably all the wires you crossed to get things working again.
be nice. I think she likes you.
your lady awaits.
don't even start. They've got him on another lonely hearts engagement.
what's that make, nine? - Ten.
how pathetic is that old bag?
well, thank you for the ride.
see you at the end of the weekend.
have fun, roger.
and stay out of trouble.
I promise nothing.
Oh, thank you.
did I tell you these are my favorites oh.
they're so hard to find this time of year.
just for you, my dear.
is this your work?
hmm, " topher. " Is that a name?
they think I'm headquarters.
it could be very urgent, or it could be topher calling to tell me that his sweater's itchy.
well, I could give it back-- or I could drop it and let the sharks talk to their own.
it's up to you.
well, it is a very slippery phone.
I have complained about that a lot.
Oh, really? I hadn' t...
that was probably a very bad thing that jushappened.
accidents-- what can be done?
you're trying so hard to relax.
which makes me wonder why you're trying so hard to relax.
am I that transparent?
no, but I have x- ray eyes.
it's been very rocky at work.
hmm, the dollhouse.
it's hard for me to even wrap my mind around it. Bizarre.
I used to head a division that grew replacement organs out of stem cells.
I could tell people what I did for a living. - And now?
you've told me what you do.
isn't it just helping lonely people?
pathetic, self- deluding souls.
now, katherine... shall we take this elsewhere?
touch?
not bad. You almost had me there.
not good either. One more point and you win.
is that all?
this is what you wanted or you wouldn't have cut me.
you have had a rough day at work.
you are perfection.
if I could make a woman, I'd make you.
Really?
Yes. In fact, if I were one of your clients,
I would order one of you with a spare for when you're in the shop.
what, katherine?
you're not seriously considering what I said? - No.
I'm not suggesting you become a client.
I think the universe might collapse under that one. - Good.
because I don't want an ersatz you.
I want the real you.
and I want the real you.
it's ironic. Sometimes I think you're the most real person I've ever met.
that's not irony. No one gets that right.
everyone has their first date.
and the object is to hide your flaws.
and then you're in a relationship, and it's all about hiding your disappointment.
then once you're married, it's about hiding your sins.
Katherine-- mistress of dark observation.
but with you, there's no reason to hide anything. Real.
let's run away together.
cash in everything we own, and buy a bar on the beach in roratonga.
and buy extra phones just to drop them in the water.
and we'd never own clocks or computers or sexy businesswoman shoes.
I'm keeping my sexy businesswoman shoes.
and there'd be no clocks in the bar, only cool local beers, and dogs that wander in from playing on the beach.
it could be the weekend all the time.
just forget it.
it can't happen.
why not? What's wrong?
something about you? Something about me?
you aren' t..
I'm not who you need?
Oh, no.
you're exactly who I need.
we just can't have that.
you have to trust me.
I do.
I trust you... completely.
darling, what happened?
I've been out for hours.
what happened?
I need copies of personnel records, security logs for the past three months and access to your mainframe.
anything else?
Yeah, some clothes. I can't catch a spy in my pajamas.
I need to interrogate all the people on this list-- now.
who the hell are you?
I made her a spy hunter. You know, hunt the spy.
it's being handled as we speak by sierra.
I know, but echo came in and... she thought...
I thought she could help.
if you let me speak to the people on this list,
I'll uncover the spy before your field agent returns.
what are her parameters?
she readanbody lguage, knows advanced interrogation techniques and she's rockin' a little sherlock holmes.
give me the list.
I want to start with him.
uh, I'm not the spy. I discovered the spy. Remember?
the spy was operating under my nose.
which means you're either dangerously incompetent or you're trying to throw us off your trail.
I'm sorry I ever doubted your programming skills.
why are you at the dollhouse?
kind of a no- brainer.
I'm in neuroplastic heaven.
I'm doing work my grad school professors haven't even dreamed of yet.
I mean, I don't want to brag...
okay, I want to brag.
I'm kind of a genius.
do you really think I'm incompetent, or are you
you're just saying that to appease big bad laurence?
so it matters what other people think about you?
Yeah. I spent eight years studying the intricacies of the human brain and what do I get to do when I graduate?
get snacks for topher, or get yelled at when i try to do something more.
my talents go beyond asking whether he wants chocolate chip or oatmeal.
which I do very well, thank you, but I probably know enough about the imprint equipment to rip it down and reassemble it without topher ever knowing.
well, that didn't sound good, did it?
I'm not trying to incriminate you.
I'm just trying to nail down your feelings about the dollhouse.
we're pimps and killers.
but in a philanthropic way.
can I go now?
I don't know why I trust you... but I do.
I must have one of those faces.
I'm looking at the security logs since the alpha incident.
when was the last time you left the dollhouse?
I feel like I can better serve the actives if I'm here.
24- seven?
engagements run around the clock.
you never know when there's going to be an emergency.
I don't doubt your intentions, but such intense focus on your work can leave other parts of your life empty
and open to exploitation.
do you have friends outside the dollhouse?
Yeah.
you lose.
Sierra's been safely extracted-- barely-- and she has the mole's identity.
no, wait. Wait, no. You don't understand. I didn't do anything.
why would I spy on the doll... - I don't care why.
we'll get that from you when dewitt has me torture you.
then you'll tell us everything.
and then dewitt will send you to the attic.
do you know what happens in the attic?
it's a mental suck.
you know that feeling you get when a name is on the tip of your tongue, but you can' t say it?
it's like that, but with every thought you never have.
I am not the spy. You believe me, right?
you take her to theng roldioom.
how long?
until dewitt gets back.
how long do you think you can keep this up?
excuse me?
you work for the nsa.
you have a file that says she's the one.
Oh, oh, what, is- is her body language telling you she's innocent?
no, her language language is telling you she's innocent.
your body language is telling me something.
when you got word that sierra had been extracted with the spy's identity, everyone in this room got tense.
who? Who betrayed us? Who's the spy?
but you... you got loose.
your body breathed a big, subconscious sigh of relief. Why?
because you already knew that file would implicate ivy.
you expect anyone to buy this pseudo- science?
they don't have to.
there was a phone call made to the national security agency after the lockdown.
you warned the nsa sierra was coming so that they could plant this file for her to find.
you wanted us to blame ivy so that you could continue to operate.
I couldn't have made the call. The phones were shut off.
in the dollhouse. Not in this office.
okay, I think it's time for her treatment.
proof is in the logs.
Yeah, and anyone could have snuck in here.
you're right.
that's why I've let this conversation continue as long as it has.
I needed one more sign to confirm my suspicion.
and what sign would that be?
this is the dollhouse. You know how far they reach.
there's no way you're getting away with this.
you haven't figured it out? Use your deductive skills.
you're a doll.
a broken doll who's gone off mission before.
now, when dewitt asks me to explain myself...
you'll tell her I went off mission again.
and I had no choice but to kill you.
and topher and ivy? - Collateral damage.
I'd say I'm covered.
shouldn't we help?
Yeah. I helped when I imprinted her with kung fu skills, but be my guest.
you're dangerous.
if it were up to me, you'd have been in the ground a long time ago.
you tried to kill me before.
you're another alpha waiting to happen.
I'm not broken.
I trusted you with a gift, mr. Dominic.
the dollhouse is not a gift.
I think the countless people we've helped would disagree with you.
how about the countless people you've hurt?
name one. - Her.
funny... coming from the man who tried to kill her. Twice.
why did you want to bring down the dollhouse?
what can the nsa do with it that we can' t?
I wasn't sent to bring you down.
I was sent to make sure you didn't bring yourself down.
if it weren't for me, paul ballard would have found you already.
I never lied to you about my methods or my priorities.
you lied about your intentions.
do you know what the world will be like when rossum lets the dollhouse slip from its grasp?
the technology needs to be reigned in and controlled.
by a clandestine organization with little government oversight?
it's embarrassing how naive you are.
you believe in the dollhouse and its mission?
just like you believed in me. And look how that played out. You were wrong.
get what you can out of him about the nsa, and have topher prep him for the attic.
that's it, miss dewitt?
you're signing my death warrant like it was a business transaction?
it is.
the agency will figure it out and they'll come looking for me.
and when they do...
you'll tell them everything's fine, and then we'll put you back in your box.
what?
did you think I'd show you mercy?
or rage?
three years by side.
I think you know me better than that.
you are a piece of work.
so they tell me. Good-bye.
what's in store for you-- you don't have much to smile about.
after you beat me to a pulp, they're going to erase me.
but first, they're going to erase you.
I can take care of myself.
I know. That's why I'm smiling.
cause one day, you'll be erasing them.
and even after all this, they still won't see it coming.
sooner or later, everybody gets theirs.
don't let him... - stop him.
get on with it.
Neuromods set for chemical saturation.
neuromuscular tolitars in place.
ltp de- potentiated.
Phertrans mag primed.
we're ready.
do it.
the, uh, unabridged laurence dominic.
lose it in the archives. I trust his body is on the way to the atti bleeding. Blood. Uh, coagulating. You should see dr. Saunders.
how did I not see this coming?
no one did. - Yes.
you saw enough to imprint echo as an investigator.
Yeah, about that.
unless you are about to give me a better parking space, I can't take all the credit for that.
she came to me and asked me to imprint her.
Dominic had her in his crosshairs for months.
she took out her biggest threat.
she's still evolving.
Saunders's wish fulfillment exercise didn't fulfill anything.
she's protecting herself.
do you want me to wipe her again? - No.
she just saved the dollhouse. Keep an eye on her.
echo might be useful to us in ways we haven't yet realized.
Oh, I almost forgot. Um, shelf the roger imprint.
miss lonely hearts phoned and said she no longer requires his services.
some hunky octogenarian sweep her off heLker?
nothing so dramatic.
she finally realized the indiscretion was unwise.
this would have been easier if you had taken an anesthetic.
it's nothing.
no, just a gunshot wound.
I know you were close to mr. Dominic.
he was an employee with whom I worked closely.
there's a difference.
it's okay to feel so thing.
that would imply I'd lost something.
didn't you?
nothing I can't live without.
ms. Dewitt?
I ran a full security sweep.
new background checks on all employees are in the works, but right now it looks like this didn't go any further than dominic.
congratulations, mr. Langton.
for what?
for becoming our new head of security.
I appreciate the offer, but I'd prefer to stay with echo.
I need to take care of her.
apparently, you don' t.
it seems she's the one taking care of us.
echo, I'd like you to meet your new handler.
his name is travis. Go ahead.
everything's going to be all right.
now that you're here.
do you trust me?
do you trust me?
I have a message for you from inside the dollhouse.
who?
who sent you?
my name is november.
your name is mellie.
they've been using this body to spy on you for months.
don't do this.
the dollhouse knows you know. They will kill you.
tell me who.
you warned the NSA sierra was coming so that they could plant this file for her to find.
get what you can out of him about the nsa and have topher prep him for the attic.
do it.
I'm taking him around the park.
he needs to stretch his legs.
all right.
I'll see you later.
we won't be long.
be good.
Hey, am I ever?
woman: Come on.
so, someone said there was gonna be tennis...?
is that what I said?
because I was pretty sure I said long island iced tea.
wait, wait, there's tea in this?
we're not playing tennis?
because I got this damn hyper carbon racket, or whatever the hell this thing is.
Hey, uh, jack...
Where's margaret?
what's wrong?
you look terrible.
Margaret, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.
you're dead.
how's the promotion treating you?
you must be thrilled.
I mean, you were no fun as echo's handler and now you get to be twice as no fun as head of security.
Yeah, well.
so far, not a lot to do.
miss dewitt's keeping the dollhouse idle for the most part, after dominic...
after dominic.
Yeah.
most of the actives are on rest.
echo's out, though?
uh, yep.
what is she, having trouble letting go, papa bear?
we put a dead lady in he that's what I heard, but I didn't believe it.
a dead client?
I guess she's special friends with adelle, or something.
I mean, not special friends.
although, late night, too much wine...
so we can give you life after death.
only if we really like you.
I need an active.
what?
Why?
I'm doing my annual anterior insular cortex diagnostic, and though it may sound simple, it's actually a very complicated super-specific imprint and I need head of security to sign off on a subject.
is there risk?
not if I know what I'm doing.
Sierra's been idle the longest.
look at you with the big decisions, big boss-man.
life after death.
where does that end?
same place it begins.
death.
this is so...
stunning.
really.
last thing I remember is coming here a month ago for that dreadful process of yours.
well, if we'd spoken in the meantime,
I'd have been able to tell you about the last three weeks of your life, but...
well, this way I don't have to remember dying.
undoubtedly a plus.
God, it's all a plus.
I mean, more life!
can you imagine?
and this body...
nice work, addy.
I'm pointing to the sky.
shame it's only a loaner.
that was always the deal.
I swear I've never felt this good.
did being young feel this good?
I seem to recall it was rather nice.
I wonder why we gave it up.
please.
you're, what, ten years younger than me?
and, oddly, 15 years older.
just remember, it's temporary.
just a chance to indulge my curiosity.
see my own funeral.
who wouldn't want that?
to hear what the world really thought of us?
to count up the number who love us?
are you all right?
well, let's see.
my friend just died.
come on.
we've got a funeral to go to.
then maybe you can help me wrap this up.
wrap this up?
your life?
well, I thought maybe I'd solve my murder.
topsy said it wasa massive heart attack.
echo: I was perfectly healthy and ridiculously wealthy.
and wealth can be a dangerous thing to have.
you suspected this might happen.
when I was three, my nanny put ground glass in my nap time snack.
she wasn't going to let me eat it.
she was going to be the hero who caught it just in time.
I snuck a cookie and spent two weeks in the hospital.
forgive me if I'm the suspicious type.
you had the scans so you could come back and solve your own murde
I like a puzzle.
are you certain you're ready for this?
of course.
come on, let's go in.
I used to say I'd be late for my own funeral, but I didn't mean it.
not a bad turnout.
I'd like to hear more weeping, of course.
you know, you don't have to do that for my benefit.
be all chipper.
come on, my dear.
I'm doing exactly what you would.
stiff back, stiff lip.
you know that's how you'd play it.
not maaret.
I'm julia now.
you've really thought this through.
I started mentioning julia now and then to my family before we started the scans.
I wrote myself into my own will, instructed the family to expect me...
while you spy on the servants and the family friends and the business associates.
a spy?
no, no, addy.
I'm a ghost.
minister: Welcome.
we are here to remember a very special woman.
Margaret bashford wasn't the first of that name.
she was a formidable woman. -Let me introduce you to the family.
I want to hear how great you were.
over there...
nicolas and jocelyn.
my god.
your children.
Adelle: Watching them go through this.
one buries one's parents.
unpleasant, but natural.
do let's focus.
like her namesake, strong...
my brother william came.
I haven't seen him in a dog's age.
seems somewhat the worse for being stupefyingly drunk.
so, no change there.
and lined up along the walls, the loyal household staff.
the grooms from the stables.
well, who are all the others?
you know.
all my closest friends.
I should probably remember their names.
every one of them a suspect.
o someone's tardy.
you never met my husband, did you?
Adelle: He is young.
when I met him, I stopped becoming such a regular customer at the dollhouse.
I can see why.
I was a lucky woman.
until recently.
almost there.
almost there.
almost...
Yes.
tell me you got speed force 3.
and downloaded the bonus maps.
pizza? -On its way.
beer in the fridge.
dude!
I've also got this new kind of battleship game I invented with real explosions.
what, like you can really get hurt?
Yeah.
my man.
appetizers.
word.
get ready to have your ass kicked and possibly lose an eye.
you're a better cook than you think.
I don't think pasta should be that, um...
snappy.
it's al dente.
that's italian for "ow, my teeth.
I know the quickest way to kill a relaonship is to take its temperature, but...
are you okay?
I'm just tired.
okay.
so, there's nothing new?
nothing with work?
you don't talk about the dollhouse much anymore. -No. I don'T.
okay.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm being...
I'll be fine.
I'm fine and you're adorable.
you're beyond adorable, you're...
if you say "adorabubble," I'm leaving.
I wasn't going to, but I love the fact you thought it was the next logical word.
I'll clear.
no, no, no.
what a gentleman.
well, it could also be I made a mess in the kitchen and I don't want you to see.
you don't seem like an old friend.
I was backpacking, like the kids do.
she sort of took me under her wing and showed me morocco.
and you stayed in touch.
she'd call and we'd talk for hours.
we were very close.
I think she liked having an outsider to sort of share her little insights with.
always gushing about her loved ones.
you know how she was.
what?
we're talking about the same woman, right? -Tallblon
stern look stuck on her face?
mid-50s, liked horses? -Yes. Margaret.
I knew her very well.
mom wasn't exactly a bundle of warmth.
she tended to push people off.
like a bulldozer.
she did like to befriend complete strangers for short outbursts, and have them stay for the weekend wearing all of my clothes.
bulldozer?
Nicolas: That wasn't a stranger.
that was camille beauvais, the tennis player. --Well, she was a stranger to me, and she was rude.
she just looked better in your clothes than you did.
my god, you slept with her, didn't you?
technically, no, we didn't sleep...
william: Ah, nicky, just like me when I was your age.
wooing all the women and sort of worthless.
he is not worthless.
nicolas has loads of potential.
Margaret told me.
it's funny how you not doing anything was called potential, and me working my ass off was called a pipe dream.
this isn't a funeral for your photography career.
what do you know, uncle bill?
we haven't seen you since mother banned you after the boat fiasco.
I was, like, 12.
Yes, margaret could be awful, but so can I.
and from what I can gauge, the two of you are hideous.
so, come on.
you should have seen our mother.
of course, you would have turned to stone.
Margaret was nothing like mother!
Your...mother.
you knew nana?
right now we should be drinking...
I wasn't aware you'd stopped... -to margaret.
to the woman she was, and to all she left behind.
split three ways.
I know margaret was guarded, but she did have a soft side.
she fell in love with jack.
well, she did like him better than she liked us, I suppose.
she loved you.
william: I haven't seen much of prince charming.
deep in grief, I suppose.
well, after she slapped him down at long last, he's sulking.
slapped him down?
she left him the horses.
she knew he didn't know anything about them, didn't care about them, but he got them instead of money.
don't you think...
no.
that's because she treasured the horses and she trusted him.
well, I'm glad that she's not around to see how he's taking that.
what did he expect?
they were in love.
Julia, I know we're being terribly shocking, and you're being charmingly loyal, but you may want to brace yourself.
you may be here to mourn margaret bashford, but the rest of us, we just live here.
I needed some air.
I think I need to explain mething about tonight.
mother thought sentiment made you...
cloudy.
I know we sound harsh, but she never would've wanted a bunch of flowery tributes that people didn't mean.
she was that hard?
well, a lot of it was fear.
she was terrified that we'd have no ambition, so she made us work for everything.
I like numbers, percentages.
so, she decided I'd work on wall street.
rode me about it every day.
she wouldn't let it lie.
that's not so...
I was 12.
she wanted the best for you!
I'm sorry. I'm not trying to lecture you.
I'm trying to...
comfort you.
you are?
inside, she...
she told me that she cried over all your pains, and she thought...
she thought all the time about what it was like when you were small d she could hold you and...
and how proud she was when you grew into this handsome, confident man.
are you, uh, gonna...
I don't,
I don't think so.
you okay? Want some water?
no? Okay? -No. I'm okay.
well, I mean, it seemed like you wanted to...
no.
subconsciously? -No!
you said you wanted to comfort me.
not with my tongue.
you also checked out my body. I saw that.
God!
okay, well, this is a new personal worst for me.
I'm so sorry.
I had too much wine.
look, I...
gotta go.
okay.
wrong room, my mistake.
no, wait.
you must be julia.
Margaret told me about you.
I don't know how I got so turned around.
well, it's a big place.
what margaret did-- I hope you know it was a gesture of trust.
What-what...
what she did?
leaving you the horses.
it was her way of saying she knew you weren't in this for the money.
right.
so you get it?
the, horses...
her real loves...
my reward.
her real...?
no. That's...
you were with them tonight, weren't you?
they call me a killer or just a gold digger?
killer? Why would they say that?
search me.
inheritance like I got?
not exactly worth killing for, is it?
echo: Addy, it's just so...
ugly.
I love these people, but I don't like them.
what if one of them...?
God.
killed you?
am I being paranoid?
you spent a year and a half having regular painful brain scans
so, paranoid is still a contender.
I thought it would be a maid.
someone who resented my money.
a distant friend, maybe.
God, adelle, there's just so much anger.
at least the first time I died thinking people loved me.
all just a worthless illusion.
illusions aren't worthless.
they're at the heart of most relationships.
I suppose you'd be out of a job if they weren'T.
we'll figure this out.
of course.
I should've stayed dead.
yes?
boyd: Eternal life.
nice adjective. Excellent noun. Is there more?
is that something we offer now?
because...
if it is, that's...
you realize that's the beginning of the end.
life everlasting-- it's...
I'm not planning on presiding over the end of western civilization.
this is a one-time situation.
you know that you're asking her to voluntarily die when the time comes.
well, if she resists,
I have a new head of security who handles that kind of thing.
Yes, ma'am.
you can still help echo, you know.
tell me your take on this.
first instinct.
follow the money.
that's not easy.
it is when the money runs.
I've looked into the horses.
one of them, king's ransom, was a derby contender not long ago.
so the husband stands to make a bundle.
so does the buyer.
I thought I'd send someone to take a look around the stables.
boyd: A breeder with a naturally curious streak.
glad to meet you.
thanks for coming all the way out here.
well, you've got some fine incentives.
Yes, I do.
one in particular.
right this way.
hope you've been treating him right, a fine horse like that.
fresh water, fresh oats, and barbecue on the weekends.
who among us could ask for more?
so, this place been in your family long?
echo: Go away.
sure.
wait. I'M...
I'm sor...
sorry.
I'm just...
God, I'm so emo.
are you?
I have to say, there's a part of me that's not sad to see someone mourning my friend.
is that what this is?
you lost your mother.
it's only natural you'd be so elmo.
emo.
that's not a word, sweetie.
God, you sound just like her.
she didn't even know me.
she didn't know me any more than you do.
she didn't want to.
I'm sure that's not true.
I take pictures.
I'm good.
she never came to a single one of my exhibitions.
you were serious about that?
I mean, obviously you were serious about that.
you're right.
that was very bad of her.
I don't...I don't know what to say.
all of her lectures about being practical, and then she throws herself at some little tropical cookie she picked up in Manila.
he is my age!
some tropical...jocelyn!
he played her like a fool.
he spent her money, and he probably slept with every woman who set foot in this place.
did he...
tell me, did he ever try... -with me?
God, no.
although I wouldn't put it past him.
if you don't believe me, go talk to him.
when your ass hits the sheets, you'll know.
I spent my whole life, watching her being...
you know, tough, and it was okay that she didn't let me in because she didn't let anyone in.
right?
and then, two years ago, she meets jack, and she's all fluttering and whispering secrets, and then...
now there's you.
whatever.
Holy...!
sorry.
you can't be here.
I need you to run some prints.
they're entered, all keyed up.
just need authorization.
comfy?
I...I shouldn't do this.
I got prints on someone who might be a missing person.
you got prints on someone who might be a doll, you mean?
they are missing people, you know. They just...
don't know it.
my god, it's her.
how do we access the file?
my god. -What...?
they're gone.
what just happened?
search RETURNED ZERO RESULTS
I just started to believe you.
Earth-identical gravity and atmosphere on other planets.
is that two?
I'll give you one.
that's fair. One ecosystem for a whole planet.
good.
human-alien cross-breeding without scientific intervention.
nice.
Flame-y explosions and sound in a vacuum.
good job.
but there's so much more.
light speed travel, space storms and a sexy sexy alien.
uh-uh, I said classic sci-fi errors.
now you're just attacking good storytelling.
speaking of sci-fi, can we play th the sleepies?
no. -Come on, topher.
we could have them battle one another and bet on them like gladiators.
we can't play with the sleepies.
or we could have them act out skits we write, film it and see who gets more hits on youtube.
that's...not a bad idea, but no.
you want to play chess?
a variant?
flying chess.
excellent. But how about every time you lose a piece you drink?
sounds good.
advantage, me.
I couldn't help, but...
are you going somewhere?
I got the first ticket to not here.
Margaret belonged here. I didn'T.
I just belonged to her.
she seemed very devoted to you.
Yeah.
was it hard?
was what what?
being married to someone older?
a man like you would have options.
hand me that tie?
maybe you didn't exercise those options.
maybe...
maybe you waited very patiently till you were free.
I know who you are.
I don't know which of them hired you, but I know a spy when I see one.
what are you trying to find out?
if I killed her, or if I'm onto the person who did?
either way, what you're doing is sick.
wearing her perfume, trying this summer stock seduction.
you working for nicolas?
Jocelyn?
tell them they're looking in the wrong place.
tell them I'm selling the horses because I can't stand the constant reminder of the woman I loved.
they want a real bad guy-- tell them to look at dear old uncle bill.
he just came for the funeral.
no. Didn't he mention that?
he came the day before she died.
he did?
that was after the last...
the last time I spoke to margaret.
he showed up out of nowhere. Needed to talk to her.
about what?
she said she'd tell me later.
if I had to guess, I'd say he wanted to borrow money.
and I guess she said no.
not short on spirit.
gorgeous.
I worked with his sire a few years back.
this one's got better hooves.
what about eiph?
no history of hemorrhaging.
Nicolas: His lungs are fine.
who the hell are you?
I'm gonna buy this here horse, if everything works out.
he barely waited for her body to be in the ground.
what was that?
this was my mother's horse.
it was her favorite...thing.
I can't believe the bastard's selling it.
he should.
this horse has got another year of racing in him.
you think so? -At least.
won't fetch this price forever, though.
you know what, I don't want to hear about it.
whatever you're doing, stop.
stop thinking, stop testing.
he's not for sale.
do you believe in ghosts?
uh, sort of.
just recently.
Margaret and I moved into this house when we were kids.
we were convinced it was haunted.
slept in the same bed the first night.
anyway-- I'm getting the same creepy feeling again, now.
like margaret is lingering here.
and she's angry.
why would she be angry?
cause she wanted more time.
you know, we hadn't said one word to each other in 13 years.
she wouldn't pick up the phone.
cause she was too damn stubborn.
and you? Why wouldn't you call?
cause I was too damn stubborn.
but fate grabbed an old fool by the scruff of his neck and brought me here.
just in time.
the day before she died.
I just knocked on the door.
can't say she was thrilled to see me at first, but I expected as much.
the important thing-- we reconciled.
can you...
can you tell me what she said?
Hey, remember the time...?
Yeah, yeah.
no, it wasn't the words that mattered.
it was...
she just looked in my face and I looked in hers.
and we just both knew there was no reason to stay mad.
here's to you, Margaret.
well, I guess I was the lucky one.
nicolas would be coping with this better if he'd talk to her about his debts and all that.
Addiction-- not for the faint of heart.
in a world where all men are guilty until proven dead, one man stand as our only hope in the fight against...
I told you I've got your back.
nice.
the quickest way to a man's heart is through his back.
it was definitely after I tried to kiss you.
well, I should hope so.
but, I mean, how would you ever even think it was possible?
the dollhouse.
in manhattan, right?
I am a customer.
Nicolas. -What? So are you.
we're all adults here, sort of.
I didn't use it for anything like this.
I mean, life after death?
I never even considered that.
I don't get to keep it.
I didn't think so.
although, the possibilities...
living forever, moving from body to body.
brilliant.
people should know that you are to be feared, mother.
even after death.
feared?
Nicky, I only ever wanted you to be happy.
I'm your mother. I'm supposed to bear your burdens, even if you lost everything.
I couldn't stop.
gambling is all about ups and downs, and when it seems like you have all these...
all these resources, you can just wait around for another upswing, so I-I kept chasing losses...
and then you hit bottom.
and I went below it.
that's millions.
I knew that you would be ashamed of me and that you wouldn't let it lie, so I-I couldn't tell you I couldn't tell you.
okay, okay.
we'll...
it'll be all right.
after you died, part of me was relieved because you never knew.
but now, I just want you back.
you were taken from me too soon.
smart boy.
you suspect that, too.
Jack: Look, he's supposed to be worth over $4 million.
go, go, go!
victor: You think you can hustle me?
what the hell do you mean?
king's ransom has been juiced.
anabolic steroids, stimulants.
enough to make his heart pop.
you really think you could hide this with a little clomiphene citrate?
I mean, masking agents can't hide themselves, you know.
if I wasn't looking for it, I might have been fooled, t I ain't a baby in this freaking business.
you were going for a money grab.
trying to pass that horse off as race ready, raise his value.
he looks that way now, but a couple weeks without that stuff, he'll be put to pasture.
I know you're new to this, but in layman's terms, you just made yourself a $4 million pet.
he killed me. god.
whatever he gave to king's ransom, that's what he used on me.
okay, okay. Calm down. We have to think.
Why? Why don't i just walk out there and let him kill me twice?
I'm dead anyway. -Because you can prove that he did it.
you can get him the punishment that he des...
run!
sorry to disturb you, mam.
not at all.
Victor tested the horse and I just got the results.
my hunch was correct. They were tied together.
your friend was killed with a drug that was being given to the horse.
the killer masked it, so the coroner didn't find it.
any idea who?
no.
if I went in... -she has a new handler.
you're going to have to get used to it.
Yes, I guess I am.
one other thing, Ms. Dewitt.
are you aware of this topher situation?
Yes.
there's no need to address the issue with him.
I allow him one of these diagnostic tests every now and again.
so, I guess topher can make friends.
Adelle: Loneliness leads to nothing good.
only detachment.
and sometimes the people who most need to reach out are the people least capable of it.
in any case...it only happens once a year.
come on, come on, come on.
he's coming. What's your plan?
you got a gun stashed somewhere?
no. You know how I feel about guns.
though I'm warming up to them right now.
evidence.
there is evidence that killed you.
just the drug, but we can't prove...
no, not that.
a letter from margaret bashford in her own handwriting, written a week ago and hidden somewhere in this room.
Nicky, that's brilliant.
great letter. Says that he'd do it, when he'd do it, and how he'd do it.
the jury is going to eat this up.
what was the date, the day I died?
the 19th.
it's all here.
how he'll use the same masking agent he's been doping the horses with to...
Jack didn't know much about them.
uh, we have to hurry. Let's find a place to hide it.
how would he learn how to drug a racehorse?
well, he must have had help.
it's not that hard to find someone with that type of knowledge, you know?
he must have, mother.
you could never let things lie.
what are you doing?
what in the hell do I have to do to get you off my damn back, mother?
this was difficult the first time.
but being around you more, it's getting easier.
Nicky, I love you.
I can even see why you drugged king's ransom.
you thought you could sell him, get out of a hole.
I had to make him worth something. In case all you only left me was the damn horses.
but jack got stuck with them.
even better.
so, you were going to kill me, no matter what.
it was the only way to get out of the hole, mom. I didn't expect you to come back.
or jack to figure out you did it.
Jack gets into everything, doesn't he?
my business. My mother's bed.
I really am sorry, mom.
this is going to sting a little.
I knew it was you.
darling! Are you all right?
he killed my wife. -Jack, are you all right?!
he murdered margaret.
he killed my wife.
what the hell is going on?
call an ambulance.
and the police.
yes?
I hope she didn't know...
didn't know the truth about her son.
it would have killed her.
it did.
most likely with clomiphene citrate or any other drug used to mask the doping of horses...
my god. She knew?
on or around the 19th.
you will also find "enclosed a last will and testament, "adjustein light of these recent discoveries.
as you may imagine,"nicolas now gets nothing, "but he will be spending his life behind bars no doubt, "so what use would it be to him?
in any case, that means "more for everybody else.
Yay.
mother wrote this?
Jocelyn,"I know that the tone of this document "may seem out of character, "but in these final days, I am feeling different, "wise and full of warmth, "and I would love to say a few things to each of you before I go.
Mellie: That was pretty crazy last night.
I don't know if I can handle that all the time, but...
I kind of liked it.
not all the time, though.
so, you going to do more hunting today?
for dollhouse clients?
I've found one.
I don't know when I'll have the chance to see something like this again.
I wish margaret was here.
you could, um...
pretend she could hear you.
no, I...
I don't believe in that stuff.
I just hope I did what I could when she was here. You know?
I tried to show her as best I could that she was...
he was my favorite person.
plain and simple.
but I'll never know if she believed me.
I have a feeling she did.
tell me you weren't tempted, even a little not to come back here today, just to disappear in this body.
maybe a little.
but I've had my turn, and the people I love are moving on.
besides...
besides?
I know you, adelle.
you're too much like me.
I wouldn't have gotten as far as the airport.
will I see my whole life flash before my eyes?
every single moment.
1982/2/1
my name is Edward Srodon.
I was born in Rzeszow, in 1938, on June second.
I am forty four.
for nine years I was working at State Farm in Mosty, Stettin voivodship.
good specialization.
graduate of a vocational high-school.
I can say that I was happy.
Grazyna, my wife, I met at my friend's wedding.
I proposed after two months.
good marriage, but no children.
wife's strong retroflexion... so the doctor said.
cause with the girls you never, you never know, if it's going great, or you should pack to go...
you know what? Rakoski was poaching fish with electricity, and water got into his rubber boots.
and he ended up in intensive care...
Grazyna?
Grazyna.
do you hear me? Grazyna!
Mundek!
come here, quick!
she fell down.
mother of God! What happened?
save her! Fuck, do something!
but what?
Mrs. Grazyna!
do something!
Jesus. She's not breathing.
reanimate her, damn it!
save her!
Grazyna!
she's not breathing...
move it! Grazyna.
Grazyna, wake up!
wake up!
fuck!
Scram!
Grazyna!!! Fuck!
fuck.
cerebral hemorrhage...
it was hard to pull oneself together.
emptiness.
my job in Mosty went down the drain. To buy vodka I was selling things.
our common things.
time was passing by.
I hit the bottom.
Mr. Srodon, wait. Three for you today.
I wanted to get away, or to flee, shall I say.
I sent out offers.
get in the line!
I chose the Krosno voivodship. State farm in Lutowiska.
nothing special, the location mattered.
you couldn't get further away.
I sold everything and got the insurance money for my dead wife.
not much, but I was to earn the rest.
I am still young, I thought.
I'll find myself a woman, God willing sire a son.
or a daughter. Extend my bloodline.
1978/10/1
wozniak fucked up, thought it was past the road chapel, hence the delay.
why are you dragging him in this condition?
I was ordered to take him.
and why technical department? - The phone is off and neighbors know she works in militia, so they won't help.
and here Banas can drive her to hospital if needed.
good morning Lieutenant! I was walking over there.
OK. Ok. Soon you'll tell us all about it.
besides Jasiak has the camera, so she can do the protocol, or something.
Hallo!
Hallo, Miss...
who are you...?
who, who? The dog bit me. The door was open... See for yourself!
says Blackie chomped him.
that's what he is for.
probably was just teasing.
should be cleaned for disinfection, there is tetanus in the mud.
and once I've smuggled a jar of chicken shit across the border.
I bought eggs at 50 pfennig a piece.
and then I smeared those German eggs with Polish shit and sold them at the double price, as fresh, straight from the Polish farm.
Swedish...
got it from a sailor, whom I helped to sell dollars on the black market.
Mr. Edek is traveling for two days.
he's on the way to the state farm.
last year when the inspection arrived they couldn't trace down 20 tones of sugar.
that's how much they were able to swindle out...
and tractors.
they are allowed to purchase Fergusons from the producer.
directly, I mean...
tell him about the zootechnician.
there was one, Stec was the name.
went to church, not like the rest of them.
wrote complaints to the authorities. And disappeared.
at the farm they said he went on a drinking spree.
true, he liked the drink.
but there is big money at stake here! - And?
probably soon you'll have in the papers that he was hit by a car, or drowned in the San river. They've already admitted he's gone, because they are looking for a replacement.
why are you staring like this? - Because they found one.
it's me. I am a zootechnician.
fuck, no doubles, no work.
sir, yesterday I've sung the Soviet national anthem in "Ratuszowa."
that's a joke?
no. And I pissed on the table.
while singing?
I don't know. We were all wasted...
Jasiak,
I just saved your ass in Przemysl.
were you in uniforms?
no, plain clothes. - Any witnesses?
this is exactly where
I first saw Bozena Dziabas.
you're experimenting with camera, and you don't have doubles?
I'll file a memo stating negligence.
this is my official order.
and anyone who refuses to carry out an order, being an employee of the militarized enterprise, is liable to penalty of im... prisonment...
take the prosecutor to the van.
sorry...
happens often here...
have you found it?
candles, but no fuses.
wire can fix it. I'll do it. - Wire and pliers in the other room.
give us a light.
quiet, Blackie!
lightnings make him mad.
fuck! Fucking Hell!
are you keeping a bike in the house?!
were they keeping a bike in a house? - Yeah. It seemed strange to me.
it's Janek's, my son's.
can get wet outside. I keep all the junk in a barn, so he brought it in.
goddamn it!
this one should work.
so, a son in the farm is what's important, isn't it?
Janek? A bright kid.
all A's or B's at school.
graduated from the technical vocational school.
can fix everything at home.
depends on when.
he can assamble such a bike and disassemble.
good with mechanics.
on July 14th '78 Madecki Thaddeus, fire brigade chief, reported his WSK motorcycle stolen, registration number
KSL 0450, paint color: red.
he said, that if we don't buy him a Polonez car, he'll leave the farm...
it's hard for me to believe. - In what?
this...
what you said about the other zootechnician.
believe it or not, your choice...
shut up, you stinker!
this is not America, for people to disappear like that.
one more?
...high quality derma, the color of your choice.
brown or black.
a modern car.
zero to a hundred in just over ten seconds...
and practical, for the whole family.
chassis, ideal for our roads......
chicken soup in an hour.
it's unhealthy to drink without a snack.
our supplies buyer in Mosty had one, brand new.
all defects were quickly fixed on warranty. Spoke highly of it.
that it's fuel efficient. And what about the car voucher?
parson has special contacts at regional state car dealer.
only the money...
boy's restless... Young, so impatient.
they want to have fun, pick up a chick.
give her a ride.
screw her.
he went to party and is gone for three days.
today he didn't come back too.
and if you try to tell him he drinks too much, a row...
no use talking. Let's drink.
Cheers.
I need to the can.
what's going on?
did you go to the proctologist?
no.
Why?
doesn't sound good.
it isn't black. - I call every dog Blackie...
hush!
fox!
have you seen it?
a Fox got inside.
killed three of my hens already.
takes advantage of the rain, scoundrel.
run to the front!
on my mark, start beating on the hen house.
and shout as loud as possible.
he'll come out through the hole on the other side, and I'll smack the rascal...
now!
yell!
scrams to the woods!
are you all right?
did they give you passports?
it's being arranged.
and the clinic?
they're holding a place for us.
but each day of delay may have consequences.
Halinka is pissed.
it must be nerves I am getting these shits from...
Mrs. Pokrywka and her son.
they agreed to be doubles... for 100 cigarettes.
and some tins.
good work, Banas.
got it? - I pulled up to the store...
just tell me, if you got a place in a queue?
no, cause I did better...
see?
Stec, Leutenant. The zootechnician's name was Stec.
clear the vodka.
no talking on the radio. Stay inside.
prosecutor fell on his face in the snow, and is recovering now...
get in, it's bloody windy.
a drink? - No, thank you.
I've heard you used to sport that.
not anymore.
it seems you don't belong anywhere.
I'm not interested in politics.
nowadays it's hard to set things apart.
for example, your suspect. What's his name...?
srodon. Criminal case.
Criminal...?
you'll get him sentenced, and we might let him leave the country.
we've got a directive to mix the offenders with political emigres.
thus we'll smear the image of Solidarity in the West, and we'll get rid of the element.
and your Srodon is not exactly so criminal.
in '76 he was setting fire to Party headquarters in Radom.
this one I can leave you.
I have a private request.
I went through protocols of interrogation...
should he be deposing something about embezzlements, state farms, sugar plant. Wipe it out.
ignore it.
it has nothing to do with your case, and someone can get hurt.
economic offences are the area of prosecutor Tomala.
no, you'll have to do it yourself, because apparently vodka doesn't suit him.
and, of course, keep it confidential.
as I shall keep this picture.
why are you so tense? Relax.
I'll play you some music.
we confiscated it from one lad at the demonstration in Cracow.
how to become perfect, mannish, handsome, strong?
how to achieve your goal Without stepping in the wrong?
ask the militiaman. He'll tell you the truth!
ask the militiaman. He'll point the way to you!
he'll point the way to you!
poor quality, isn't it? Garage studio.
as we are talking music and militia, let's discuss yesterday's incident with Sergeant Jasiak.
there was a delegation from Leningrad in this restaurant.
they've reported.
phone calls from the Ministry from the early morning, the Party Committee buzzing that militiamen got drunk.
that they were offending the Soviet Union.
it was just an accident.
this Jasiak is already gone!
the only question is, whether you'll file a memo and save your ass, or you are stupid enough, to force me to do it and then you are both finished.
I'll also need a list of those who drank with him.
I'll collect it on the way back from Arlamow.
and I know how to be grateful for the sugar plant.
what would you say for an early promotion to Captain, a Polonez car, and in the future continuing your career in Warsaw?
because Rzeszow seems too small for you.
what did he want?
Radom, '76.
and this took you so long to discuss?
damn, we'll be fucking with this case for months.
but why, is he political?
maybe yes, maybe no.
banas give me the keys.
drink what you have to drink, and when I'm back, no more booze.
Lisowski! You're in charge. - Yes sir.
from the top rank down!
somebody took our picture.
in the hotel, in Jastarnia.
get inside.
militia from Sanok arrived.
they started looking for an arsonist in the village.
they've found some evidence at the site of the fire.
but no one was caught red-handed.
so they went away and next week two more barns burned down.
thus we called up a citizens watch and agreed with Madecki, our fire brigade chief, to patrol at nights. Because all the fires started at night only.
the Militia was snooping around again. They even suspected Janek, because he had no alibi for one night.
but everything was cleared up eventually.
and on the following night another shed is burning.
we ran with Janek to help put out the fire.
Madecki sees the wind's pushing flames toward the forest.
he orders to call in reinforcements, because he can't handle it alone.
Janek went to make a call.
there are three phones in the village: at parson's, in the state farm and at Madecki's, because he's a fire chief.
stop it!
why this stench of petrol? - Damn, if you squeal a word...
and he draws a knife from his pocket.
and it turned out to be what? - What?
Blacharz was setting sheds on fire.
Madecki was out to quench them, and at that time Blacharz was screwing his wife.
Yeah, extinguishing a barn can take the whole night.
fiery love affair, that's how they called it in a paper.
and what happened with this Blacharz? - He's serving time.
in the nearby jail.
they say, he's got a walleye.
and a huge chunk of forest went up in smoke, because Janek smashed the phone.
such a scheme, Mr. Dziabas, only to get laid...
why are we so formal?
I'm older so I should propose.
Zdzisiek. - Edek. Edward.
good morning. - Good morning.
who ever will talk to me, gets cigarettes.
about the state farm.
and the zootechnician who disappeared.
anyone knows who I am talking about?
militia issue?
that was, when they elected the pope.
will do?
no... It was earlier. The pope was in October. On the 16th.
you've introduced Martial Law, so you have it.
booze sold from 1: 00 pm and smokes only for the chosen. Bloody hell.
jan Stec. Sung so nicely at church.
Yeah, religious, he was.
only didn't like beer. Said it muddles him.
once he shit in the milk can.
he didn't drink with us. - Most often with the priest.
with the priest he was up to something else.
quiet, you pervert. - Laying pipe or blowing it.
fuck, give us the whole bag! They have everything without ration coupons!
solidarity!
...Satan can use to his ends...because aren't nuclear holocausts...
because, nuclear holocaust... holocausts, Jesus... aren't they.
aren't nuclear holocausts the proceeds...
...and the totalitarian Stalinist state...
I am not interested in politics. Just criminal cases.
I'd like to talk about the zootechnician.
jan Stec.
...so one must think of something to substitute in this place...
to quench this seasonal demand.
what other problems are there with the rain wear?
it seems we have only an umbrella at our disposal.
I'm impressed, as you must have made an extensive market analysis, because you hit the bull's eye as far as article assortments go.
one has to say that today in such rain wear we generally can offer an umbrella.
of course, you would be thinking about some interesting coat...
a coat, shoes, rubber boots.
I have to admit that the first issue that makes me uneasy is the problem of a coat or a cape.
the first clothing of such a type used to be a coat or a cape...
thank you. Delicious. Haven't tasted something that good in long time.
nothing special, quickly made.
you have asked a very bothering question.
the matter is, that for the longer period of time...
sorry.
...the industrial offer of such clothing has diminished.
it was delicious. I am full.
it's a very hospitable home here, but I should be on my way.
really, I have to be going.
are you uncomfortable here, Edek?
no, quiet opposite.
at four there is nobody in the farm, except for the watchman.
bozena will tell you. Tell him Bozena.
besides, do they know you are coming today?
no. All they know is that I am coming this week.
see? You can sleep here.
Janek won't come back tonight. You'll rest like a king.
it's true. Everything's closed down at the farm.
we'll have a drink, and in the morning, you'll be there in one hour.
I'm causing a trouble. You want to spend a family evening.
cut the crap. Let's drink.
make us a coffee.
and switch to Bratislava.
all this politics makes me want to puke.
dear friends. The Warsaw automobile factory presents...
I'll make the bed at Janek's.
...an amazing new car.
look Edek! We were just talking... Polonez.
in czesky television!
jan had stolen invoices, reports and protocols of damage from the state farm and a couple of cooperatives.
I know, a wrong deed, but for noble reasons.
he wanted to stop embezzlements.
in the paper they wrote he was driving a mini-Fiat and collided with a truck.
but he didn't have driving license.
dead on the spot.
here they report he spent the night with a woman of ill repute, this is her nickname and initials.
probably you can trace her down.
she informed how much they drank and that later...
you know...
but Jan was a homosexual and suffered greatly because of his shortcoming.
one more thing...
quite recently, a Solidarity activist, the same curve near Nisko.
maybe a coincidence, but maybe a method.
I am happy to dispose off this earthly secret...
of course I shall renounce everything in the court.
so, Zdzisiek, you're saying that this state farm is fishy?
tomorrow you'll see for yourself, and know more than we do...
have to go out for a moment.
fresh air will do me good.
and I need to put out the snare for the fox.
while I'm still sober.
shall I go with you?
no. Drink the coffee.
she'll make us a strong one.
I'll get the fucker.
excuse me.
what's going on?
she might have a crevice, but won't let me have a look.
everything's all right.
fuck, all right. She had contractions.
bloody hell. What did you do with the car, Lieutenant?
take her to the hospital.
there's no need. - No discussion.
why are you making all this fuss? The baby is due in two weeks.
he hit you?
the nearest hospital is in Krosno. If not, then Sanok or Korczyn.
Where's Lisowski? - He's no good. I'll go with her.
Lisowski... Lieutenant got boozed up and started yelling that he'll do a blood test when the child is born.
he hit her? - But just once. Then we've put him into the van.
only the keys were inside and he drove away.
where to? - Fucking vanished, sir. - And Tomala?
the Prosecutor woke up earlier, downed a shot and is like a newborn.
now he's conducting the investigation.
Petrycki, you were in the traffic department until recently?
Yeah.
the curve near Nisko. Many accidents?
it's a private question.
once a certain Major hit a truck.
they say, he was blown away for arm deals.
Petrycki, - go see the dentist. - My molar is giving me hell...
so, how much have you drank? A lot? - We had a bit.
but precisely?
I am talking grams.
there you are finally.
so...?
we were into third bottle by then.
me and Dziabas, we drank more than half a liter each.
and she was just sipping. 300 grams, not more.
have you been convicted for drunken brawls?
give me that.
you read it.
Mosty, Stettin voivodship, 1973.
suspect Edward Srodon pushed a colleague into the pond.
fined with a warning in his employee record.
what are you trying to pin on me? - Gdynia, 1975, a fight in a bar...
you don't have any sugar at home for the guest's coffee?!
turning a house into the joint? Watch it, you whore, or you'll get it!
I was too good, wasn't I?! - Easy, take it easy.
wanna leave? Nobody's stopping you! Nothing here is yours.
you're ready to fly again? You want to fuck and fool around? So scram!
you are drunk like a skunk again.
Zdzich, calm down.
Eddie. - Calm down.
Yeah, calm down.
at the wedding, her sister six times shuttled to the barn.
and later she wept, because she could have charged three hundred per bang...
you bitch.
Janek's mother died when he was five.
Bozena,
I took from a joint.
quiet!
I needed a woman.
and if someone laughed, that she's younger, I'd smash his mug.
guys like to lay their eyes on her.
you like that too, Edek.
I'm sure kidneys are going to hurt me like hell tomorrow.
maybe, if you'd had the factory made, but not mine.
Zdzich, do you think I can't smell a moonshine?
you didn't smell this one.
in Mosty we were distilling too.
it was smelly, but still we were making good money.
only, by stupid mistake, the militia found out...
they ruled high penalities.
but I was lucky, totally stoned I landed for 3 days in Radom.
Holly shit.
damn.
wait, wait.
the car radiator.
copper piping.
Dephlegmator!
what kind of strength are you getting?
after 4 runs - 92 per cent.
I'll be damned, impressive!
and what's the raw stock?
if it's not a secret, of course.
peas.
I add lemon. Kills the smell and doesn't alter the taste.
but they can't be Hungarian.
too weak.
you should be selling.
to whom? Half of the people here moonshine.
what a kick.
Zdzich! Let's do it together!
we'll put a rectifying column here, one meter, one meter and a half... We'll have to dig it into ground.
are there any Soviet units in the area?
an ideal place! I know what to do, because in Mosty it was running smoothly.
then why did they find out?
one of ours was selling booze to militia.
they got drunk at the station. A scandal.
but we'll sell only to the Soviets, on an industrial scale, I mean...
so what? A deal?
Zdzich.
Agreed?
deal.
labor 10 thousand, this includes radiators.
ten thousand.
where did you get the copper from? - From a factory in Sanok.
this amount I have here cost two thousand.
14 thousand. - And a grand for transport.
can't smuggle so much copper on the bus.
fuck off my barrel.
don't fuck with me. It's too small.
fuck yourself. - Buzz off. We'll need a water pump.
and glass pipes?
Madecki's brother-in-law works in the glassworks.
in Krosno.
I'll find a way to organize sugar from the state farm.
won't be easy. The Party keeps it's hand on it. For cronies...
fuck them.
damn, wait...
Dziabas said, the priest had good connections, because he secretly gave first communion to the sugar plant director's son.
and if we spare him a hundred bucks, everything can be arranged.
the sugar plant has nothing to do with the case.
don't put it into the protocol!
and the suspect, be brief, because we're not going to sit here all night.
how much money did you need?
two hundred.
milk cans.
Janek will pull out some from the dairy.
twenty for delivery and twenty for exchange.
fifty. - Fifty to make it even.
if worse comes to worse, ten will do for transporting milk.
50... 15, totals 59.
first delivery should be free, to entice them.
Cheers.
dollars, 6, 8...
fuck! One hundred for starters.
I've thought it would be less too.
damn, a serious venture.
wait. Say, how many Russkies are in the base?
three, or five thousand for sure.
maybe more, hell knows them. - Ok, but let's say five.
carry the five, zero down.
jeez, 50 grand for a delivery.
that gives two hundred in a month.
Holly shit, in four weeks you get your investment back plus a hundred grand for two of us!
and the next month only half of the cost, just for the raw stock.
you'll be picking up your Polonez in January!
and in the future we could add this jail, where's this guy who did Madecki's wife.
they'll always find money for booze in prison.
Polonez... - Polonez you'll have...
fuck, just one hundred for starters...
Polonez... - We'll be fucking rich! Zdzich!
Edek... Eddie... - What, Zdzich?
help me.
with what? - Move it.
Edward, under this floor lays 60 thousand.
I was putting away for Janek, for the Polonez.
sixty thousand.
Zdzich, this is fucking everything I have left in my life.
43 thousand zlotys, 30 PKO dollar coupons, 91 dollars...
and 52 Deutsch marks.
Zdzich.
Eddie.
Eddie, I am telling you, we'll do it.
Zdzich, in this suitcase...
you've got brains, brother, to figure it all out...
fucking amazing.
enough.
you can use some sleep too. You won't get up in the morning.
Bozena, darling... I didn't mean it, I was just talking...
go.
bloody hell!
where is Marysia?
bugger off!
what moonshine trading?!
don't you know how it is when you had a drink?
drunk people say crazy things!
and Mosty?
what about it? - 76'?
did they prove anything to me?
break.
he keeps everything for this stinker.
and sonny is almost thirty one, drinks, spends all the money and rules.
he shows up at home only when he is short of cash.
he'll milk every last cent.
he tried to lay hands on me. When I chased him away, slammed his face, he told the old man that I steal and sleep around.
and isn't it true?
why do you say that, Edek...?
why did you get in my bed?
to play fucking cards?
there is one already here, who when drunk turns into a redneck.
you gave me a shag, but if you want to babble on like this, then scram.
what's with your face?
give me this memo on Jasiak.
I don't have it.
then write it down.
I've already told you, I'm not interested in politics.
interesting...
banas reported that it bears your fingerprints.
should Lieutenant be interested, I can spare a few kilo.
they checked us on three roadblocks!
didn't look for a pig.
one of the interns went awol.
but they won't find him.
because who escapes from internment camp?
for sure some secret police plant. They're making a cover story for the prick.
and this scoundrel Jasiak.
you're defending him, and he reported on you as a participant in appropriation of the seized vodka.
remember Przemysl, Bork's case?
you vouched that the dog knocked down the crate to the ground.
and your friend, expert Zajdel.
was so happy when I promised him a passport for his wife, that he wrote, you were drinking on duty.
admit it, you won't return when you get passports.
you know any reason for coming back?
that he sew you twice. In 1976...
anyone else?
all of them.
I didn't have to ask Lisowski.
he's reporting on you regularly, because he doesn't like you.
he wrote that "by means of operational reconnaissance
he was able to establish your...
derogatory attitude towards departmental holidays."
you won't ask about his wife?
how do you feel?
what do you want me to say?
just between us, who is the father?
you or Lisowski?
the truth.
there is no such thing.
somehow they had to earn this allotment for the flat, didn't they?
you remember Sergeant Kania from dactyloscopy?
Oh, and Sergeant Kania, you remeber? The one from dactyloscopy.
I thought that everyone had her...
she claims you've raped her during the inspection journey.
everyone had her, except for me...
...because I was drunk. And Tomala. Because he's a fag.
what else can you tell me...
the child is the most important.
......about the prosecutor...... - Nothing!
and you won't report on this Jasiak?
still we can talk about the sugar plant.
you were right. This is a completely different matter.
I'm glad.
for no reason.
when I get back I am going to report a crime.
sugar, agricultural machines, construction materials, false invoices, protocols of loss and damage.
a few names from the Party Committee, the transfer rubles, dollars...
not all signed by you and your brother, but...
am I mistaken, or Srodon's case is going to be your last one, Lieutenant?
what the fuck is this? - What the fuck is this?!
the Zootechnician's last will.
because there is also a homicide case. Jan Stec.
jan Stec. Sung so nicely in a church.
officially died in a car accident near Nisko.
cold as in a Swedish Circus...
we'll make it quick, so you won't get pissed.
several other people died in the same place, under same circumstances...
perilous curve, Lieutenant.
but as for the sugar plant, you have something on me and I have something on you.
let's call it a tie.
that's me in Radom. I was salvaging the Party building.
salvaging it?
Yeah, because they set it on fire.
get out.
do you know what this is?
a gradual release of an agent... Esperal. - Can you take it out?
with what?
bloody cross stitches.
sorry.
son of a bitch.
you're allowed only after forty-eight hours, but in Mosty there was one guy...
what do you want to charge me with, Lieutenant?
please hide it and return to the priest.
give it to him.
Wozniak.
hand me the paper.
your testimony:
I couldn't sleep.
the state farm, seemed uncertain.
I started doing push-ups." Why?
to sober up I think...
later I went out to the can,
get some fresh air, and think.
what about?
that everything went too fast.
the deal with Dziabas. And that I screwed his wife...
there is no such thing as happiness. This evening didn't turn out so well.
banas is back.
why the hell did they bring her back?
I've already told you several times, Lieutenant.
you know the truth.
truth? There is no such thing.
shit in Sanok, in Krosno one decent doctor got interned.
she'll have to go to Rzeszow.
what's going on, Lieutenant? Please don't drink anymore.
eight hours after waters break, because she's primipara.
one hour here, an hour and a half drive, you have four hours for the hospital. Fine with you? Fine.
you aren't mad at me darling?
wait in the van.
Banas, stay with her. That's an order.
the suspect is lying, because he never went to the outhouse.
no? Then where? - There, where Dziabas lost the axe.
that's not true.
I don't want you to film me with this.
pick it up, you bastard.
pick it up.
what the fuck...?!
all right, so tell us your version, Srodon.
I don't know how long I was sitting here, because the alcohol got to me.
a noise woke me up from the numbness.
I thought, that maybe he wants to beat her up again.
that she had told him about the intercourse.
the bed was empty. I heard a scream.
Srodon, the whole bedding has been chopped with an axe!
what axe?! What're you trying to frame me in!?
admit, you tried to kill them.
this is fucking bullshit!
blood was everywhere...
she was standing on one side, he over here, holding the knife over the head.
they came to slay me for the money in my suitcase.
nobody knew me. Nobody saw me.
their son got back from partying and passed out.
they slaughtered him. Cut his throat in darkness.
the knife's gone. Somebody must have poked in here.
you have a mess in the material evidence.
sorry.
let's have a walk-through one more time.
fuck...
where are you, bastard?
the suspect has stated, that when Dziabas was chasing the fox, he fell down in the mud, right?
right.
and that the axe landed near the well.
why the axe again?
yes or no?
Yes.
so how could Dziabas dash from the house with an axe?
I don't know. Maybe he brought it in earlier?
I could have made a mistake.
anyway, what's the difference?
they've murdered him!
what have you done with him? - Who allowed you to ask questions?
I want to know, what've you done with Lieutenant?
why aren't you taking notes?
once again.
where and when did the suspect loose the axe?
it's your fault! - It's my fault for fifteen years!
you never loved him, cause he wasn't yours!
but you loved him all right. Instead of the Polonez, you've cut his throat.
I didn't do it alone!
but you didn't recognize him under the knife.
and it turned out perfectly, you've killed a hoodlum!
the whole village was afraid of him. And you too.
probably you were provoking him! Like Srodon.
the suitcase. We can still make a good living off it...
and what you put away for the car.
we'll say Srodon did it.
we only have to stick together when the militia comes.
how did you escape from the barn?
I've told you, the lightning struck, caused a spark, the straw caught fire.
I got away at the last moment.
like a fox... through the fox hole.
give me that.
you recognize this?
no.
put it down: doesn't recognize.
here are your collected fingerprints.
and a piece of your rain coat.
they wanted to kill me.
so I took their money.
you ordered yourself a break?
get out, you prick.
a blow in the head with the dull side of an axe, right-handed man.
the body was found five meters further away...
Mrs. please move over there, the boy too... Hawryluk, move them.
this proves... Write it down.
......that the suspect......
damn.
...could not have seen the whole event.
what's going on? - Make her away.
Marysia!
wozniak, move your ass! - To the kitchen. Move.
they'll kill you, during the escape.
take her away.
get out. Now.
you're being framed. Beat it.
the mattress, mattress...
quiet, quiet. Get the can...
lay her down. - Put snow in the can.
only vodka, damn you. Get out... - Fuck, yes sir.
breathe slowly.
push!
Marysia.
no...
one more time.
one more time. It's almost here.
one more time! - I can't!
Yes! It's here.
it comes from a little company called Apple.
apple was started in a small town in northern California by two friends:
steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.
united by their interest in technology, and dissatisfied with the attempts at personal computers by others, they knew they could do better and set out to make the world's first good personal computer in the form of the Apple I.
the Apple I became the Apple II.
the Apple II became the cornerstone of an industry that would change the world.
in 1984, Apple introduced Macintosh and Macintosh thrusted the industry forward into a new era.
its style and ease of use gave computers to the rest of us and inspired the next revolution in computing.
but dark times followed and Apple slipped into the background of the computer industry.
in the late '90s, a reinvigorated Apple would return to shake things up agai and push the envelope of design and engineering.
whether you know it or not, these events have changed your life.
we're good. We got your sound?
is she on speaker? - Yeah.
jordan, hold on.
are you ready to go? - Yeah.
okay, so this is the story of how I was introduced to Macintosh unintentionally.
my first Macintosh was an SE with a 30-megabyte hard drive.
the first Mac I used was my dad's Classic.
he had a Mac Classic, a Mac Plus...
first Macintosh I purchased was on the day of the introduction.
well, I had an Apple II in '79.
and then I had an Apple III.
and then I got to play with a Lisa in 1980.
I had a Blue and White G3, had a Lombard PowerBook, had a Pismo PowerBook, had a Titanium PowerBook.
I was given a Macintosh 128 as one of the, you know, first hundred people in the Mac division.
the first computer that we had...
the LC, right, which I had to take away from you because you told me it was gonna cost $2500, gave you my credit card. I think it must've been about 1980, I played with a Lisa and that changed everything.
so it had two floppies in front and a 30-meg hard drive and I thought I was in heaven.
I mean, how could anybody ever use that much hard-drive space?
after the introduction, we were so keyed up we couldn't really go back to work.
so that afternoon we drove around to the different computer stores in the Bay Area, trying to purchase a Mac.
the first one I owned, the first one I bought with my own money, was a 7200.
and I bought an expensive monitor and it cost me about $3500.
I got my Aluminum PowerBook, I had a dual 800 G4 with a SuperDrive.
I've got my G5 at home.
I stopped counting.
Yeah, you ended up spending 7000, so I had to go and retrieve the computer from you and get it back.
and so I inerited this computer that I had no fucking idea what to do with or anything.
and it was, like, a lot of money.
I had to borrow it off my mom.
and it took me years to pay her back.
if you think about it, from '84 to 2007, you know, that's 20-something years.
I've probably had 50 Macs.
and basically I've had a Mac since April of '84 and pretty much have had almost every Mac in my hands since then.
so that's how I was introduced to Apple.
I had to go and get it from you and retrieve it from you because you had spent too much money on my credit card.
it was the hardest thing I ever did.
I had to go and retrieve the computer from my own son.
Yeah, it was pretty hard, man. It was not easy.
okay, all right, all right. So that ends that discussion, okay.
all right, so we're gonna move on now. Okay, bye.
apple was founded twice.
and each time there were three founders.
two of them were Woz and Jobs but the third one, in both cases, is not extremely well-known.
in the first case, it was this guy named Ron Wayne who was just sort of a smart, general-purpose guy.
he, being artistically inclined, drew that first Newton logo that the Apple Computer Company, not the corporation, had.
the logo essentially was my own idea.
they had hit upon the idea of using the name Apple for Apple Computer.
once they had done that, and if you have an original idea and you have an apple and you... The two simply fall together.
the classic story of Newton and the apple.
and so it was that I sat down and thoroughly enjoyed myself with India ink and pen and illustration board and went ahead and created this image of Newton with the apple above in a detailed, wind-blown ribbon that had the "Apple Computer Company" on it.
and around the border I had put in the philosophical comment:
mind forever voyaging through strange seas of thought alone.
which, of course, comes from the Wordswon'th sonnet.
and that last line seemed to fit perfectly with the whole concept of this wonderful new product that was going to make the foundation of a new company.
apple was founded again, though, as a corporation in 1977 and third founder was Mike Markkula.
he's a little more well-known than Ron Wayne.
when Apple came out, they were building the Apple I's in the garage.
the Apple I could have a keyboard attached directly to it and a computer monitor attached to it instead of lights and switches.
you could actually have your own interface.
it was groundbreaking technology.
wozniak had designed this genius piece of engineering but he wanted to give it away. What kind of crazy idea is that?
so Jobs was the one who figured out this thing should be sold.
what Woz said recently, I think he said, "I don't want credit for designing the first personal computer, I just want credit for designing the first good one."
rumor has it that Jobs hated the Apple I.
I've heard numerous stories that it didn't work properly all the time or there was issues with it.
they were encouraging and promoting the Apple II, so they were giving discounts on Apple ll's if you traded in your Apple I.
sometimes they would do an outright swap.
they wanted them off the market.
then they were getting bandsawed in half.
but there was supposedly 200 boards made.
now, not all of those were sold. I hear Woz has some in storage who knows how many, maybe a half dozen or so.
value?
I've heard as high as 50, 000 for one, but a perfectly running one in a case is gonna fetch more.
if it's got the cassette and the manuals and all that stuff.
I started doing my research on the Apple I's and the value of them.
pretty much realized I could never afford one.
and I had gone to the user-group website Applefritter.
I talked to some people and there was discussion about making a replica of one, and nobody really stepped to the plate, so it was a lot of research.
I've still, to this day, never seen an actual Apple I in operation.
a lot of it, electronically, I could figure out.
some of it, visually, there was no way to tell without asking people, so I had to interview owners or previous owners of Apple I's to see:
Hey, what does the cursor look like? Is it solid, is it blinking?
it's authentic and it's true to its memory locations and it's functioning.
it will completely operate just like the Apple I.
there wasrt really a lot of commercial software available.
most of the stuff was converted from programs that were given out in Creative Computing magazines or written initially for another computer, which was converted over to the Apple I.
there was no such thing as a production case for it.
most Apple I's that you see in a wooden case, somebody built on their own.
one of the most common things l... Questions I had was:
why didn't you make it look like an Apple I?
I didn't want people selling these as forgeries, as being an actual Apple I.
for one, it's Woz's work, and I don't want anybody infracting on that.
it's respect for the people that actually do own the Apple I's.
I don't want this project to devalue the Apple I.
I had tried getting ahold of somebody from Apple and, you know, saying:
this is what's going on. Can I get permission to use the source code?
I didn't hear anything back so I tried to get ahold of Woz through his website and next thing you know, Wozniak had written back, saying:
go ahead and use the source code. I think it's, you know, a noble idea.
apple probably wouldn't let you, but the worst thing Apple could say was that it was mine long before there was an Apple computer.
he had given out the source code, schematics and everything at the Homebrew Computer Clubs long before Apple existed.
so it was pretty much his source code to give out.
I guess, yeah, they're kind of an unlikely couple, an unlikely pair, to...
you know, Steve Wozniak was the hardware genius.
he's kind of a blue-collar hacker, interested only in the engineering.
jobs was the salesman, the slick, smooth talker, good-looking young guy.
you gotta remember, the Apple II were designed essentially by kids who didn't have any success behind them.
and Woz is like a hero, the great nerd hero of our times.
I mean, every geek and nerd reveres Woz.
he is, you know, a living legend, a demigod, a god amongst man.
not only for his genius, but just for that sort of purity of hacker spirit, you know, the generosity of his genius.
the idea that he's not motivated to enrich himself.
you know. He wants to build astonishing things.
and he did.
this was more... The Apple II was more like a work of art, it was whimsical.
it was outrageous, some of the techniques in the ROM.
and so as I worked my way through it, I thought:
who would design in such a style and why?
and it's just the greatest thing I'd ever encountered.
it was very much like reading a great novel from an author you've never heard of or hearing a great piece of music.
it captivated me.
it captivated me.
one of the biggest success stories would have to be Team Number 1.
team Number 1 was the original franchisee of the Team Electronics chain. Team Central was the organization of all the Team Electronics stores, some 100 stores mostly in the upper Midwest, and it continues to operate to this day.
they've changed their name to FirstTech with the demise of Team Electronics.
but to my knowledge, that would make them the longest continuously running Apple reseller in the United States.
there's more back there. Yeah. - You've got a Bell + Howell.
I don't think we ever wanna fly this. It's probably not...
not flight-won'thy? - Whoa, is that a kite?
it is, but it's just too valuable, you know. - Oh, yeah.
we got an Apple III back there and some other stuff too.
but most... This is mostly the fun stuff.
Oh, yeah. - And we're pretty sure it all works.
back in 1977, I convinced my boss... At the time I was working as a buyer for the Team Electronics chain, which was headquartered here in Minneapolis.
convinced him to let me go to the first annual West Coast Computer Faire.
out there, I discovered a number of companies.
I'd gone to look at the processor Sol machine.
I was already aware of the Altair.
discovered a little company called Apple who had a pretty good-sized booth right inside the front door.
struck up a conversation with the gentleman who told me they really werert producing yet.
it would probably be later that year, October, something like that.
the gentleman seemed quite knowledgeable and once he found out that I was a buyer for a chain of electronics stores, was very interested and it turned out the person I was talking to was Mike Markkula.
Mike proceeded to talk to us about the program over the coming months, we put together agreements and whatnot, and in the end he grabbed one of the first machines to come off the line, put it in a bag, jumped on an airplane and brought it to Minneapolis.
this was that machine.
and you'll notice that the bag does not have a bite out of the apple.
I don't know if that was a mistake on the part of the people who produced it or more likely, that it was produced early on, before Apple decided taking the bite out of the apple would make it more registerable, if that's a word.
and this is the original brochure......that came with the Apple II, or for the Apple II.
it's very simple, has an apple on the cover.
and if you'll notice on the wall beside us there is a photo that looks suspiciously familiar.
that is one of three photos that was ever produced in photo form.
I was given one for Christmas by Mike Markkula l'm told that their banker at the Bank of America got one and that there was a third one at Apple.
and to my knowledge there are probably only one or two in existence any longer today.
you'll notice many of the things here on the original brochure.
one was that they came with cassette tapes to load the programs.
for a long time, we sold Apple cassette-tape machines to sell with the machine because they couldn't get them otherwise.
remember, the computer was fairly expensive.
in fact, I happen to have an October 1977 price list.
and a computer system with 16K of RAM which was what we typically sold it at was $1698.
now, you can have a good chuckle today 16K was $540.
so to outfit a machine completely would take you up to about $40, 000.
these are the pieces of software that were available originally with it.
there was a checkbook, home-management cassette.
there was the Breakout game, which was a little bit like Pong a Star Trek game and high-res graphics routines.
and that was what you could get with it at this point in time.
that was every piece of software Apple had.
and then this is the real deal.
this is the real deal. It's a used computer.
it was actually used, but here's the key.
there's the serial number.
and as you can see, this was serial number five.
fifth machine to ever come down the line assuming they put stickers on one through four.
this machine was in regular use probably up until...
well, it was in regular use past the introduction of the Macintosh so probably up until 1984 or '80... No, '86 or '87.
this machine was in regular use.
that's what you came all this way to see.
so basically you had this before anybody else did.
Yes, we...
I guess I have to say I identified the potential of the product.
we were the first dealer/distributor that Apple ever had.
I wrote Apple's first distributor agreement, which was liberally plager...
I mean, inspired by a Pioneer car-stereo agreement went through and defined the terms and what would be done and sent it back.
and Apple had their lawyers take a look at it and we signed it.
and we were the first-ever Apple dealer.
the Macintosh began with Jef. Jef Raskin was a professor at UCSD.
Jef was a music professor as well as a computer professor.
Jef was hired at Apple to start the Pubs Department at Apple.
Jef is a great writer. Was always...
just had a great sense of humor, was really articulate had a great rebel attitude.
in... I believe February '79 was the very beginning of the Mac project, where he approached Mike Markkula to ask...
to talk about his ideas about a low-cost, easy-to-use computer.
and so he started writing a series of papers later became called, I guess, the Macintosh Papers.
and then around the fall of '79, he...
Mike Markkula was impressed enough with the papers that he gave him some budget to pursue starting a project.
Jef needed hardware for a prototype.
Jef had sort of the basic idea of the hardware spec'd out.
he had the notion of the bitmap display which was, of course, crucial to it being a Macintosh.
but anyway, he needed to find a hardware designer and Bill Atkinson ran into Burrell, who was working in Service Department.
bill had seen glimmers of Burrell's genius.
he introduced him to Jef as:
here's the guy who could design your Macintosh for you.
Jef said, at the first... "We'll see about that."
Jef was very proud of himself.
but he quickly...
to Jef's credit, he quickly saw Burrell was the man to do the job.
the project really took on reality when Burrell did his first design over Christmas vacation at the very, very end of the decade.
I think that's a notable point about the Mac that writers don't really make.
it was really born with the 1980s because it was designed right at the cusp of the decade ending.
but meanwhile, once he got that going......Steve Jobs got wind of it, as well as other people at Apple, that boy, here's this board that is one-third the price of the Lisa that's twice as fast. That's amazing.
the most common inspiration, clearly, was the Apple II.
steve Jobs was even explicit about that telling us we were reincarnating the Apple II for the '80s.
I realized, as we were trying to complete the software that, boy, the Mac was so heavily graphics-based we needed someone who was a world-class graphic designer.
I had basically asked Susan to come as my date to a few of the Macintosh parties we had.
that was kind of the first connection.
and she met some of the team and really liked them and so I proposed that she work on it.
but the Mac prototypes were too rare to get her one.
so I first started her off with graph paper.
went and just bought some pretty fine graph paper and told her to make drawings by filling in the squares or not.
and she did some fantastic work, doing some drawings that way that I think I still have somewhere.
and so I showed them to people on the team and they said:
boy, yeah, she's good.
Jef made one other key hire, a woman named Joanna Hoffman who became the Macintosh's first marketing person.
she has a great story about being interviewed by Jef while Jef was at his piano keyboard.
and when he liked something she said, he'd play a happy little melody.
if he didn't like it so much, he'd express his reactions musically.
and those original Mac team members, to this day, are my best friends, my extended family. I would do anything for them.
apple, consciously or not positioned itself as an alternative to IBM which represented the establishment, the government, big corporations.
in 1977, Apple, a young, fledgling company invents the Apple II, the first personal computer as we know it today.
ibm dismisses the personal computer as too small to do serious computing and unimportant to their business.
and this was at a time... Post-Watergate, late '70s.
people were suspicious of the government and what it represented.
and the PC, the personal computer, was a revolution in computing.
and at the time, there was a utopian mindset.
the idea that technology, especially personal-computer technology would enable people to throw off the shackles of society and foment a technological revolution.
ibm enters the personal-computer market in November '81 with the IBM PC.
it is now 1984.
it appears IBM wants it all.
will Big Blue dominate the entire computer industry?
the entire Information Age?
was George Orwell right about 1984?
he made a lot of money out of Apple but he dropped out of Silicon Valley and he taught high school for 10 years.
he volunteered in, you know, the local high school to teach kids engineering and computer science.
when Apple lost Steve, they lost their way, to some extent.
they became a shadow of what they were.
you know, the first half of the '90s, they were sort of all over the place.
they didn't know exactly what the best thing for them to do was.
didn't know if they were supposed to be licensing the operating system or if they should be making the Newton and trying to do the next big thing.
well, I think the main thing that touched most people was at the time, all the press was bad about Apple. Apple's gonna die, Macintosh's market share was slipping.
there's no software, there's no hardware.
everything was coming unglued.
my first job at Apple was software evangelist.
so my duties were to find developers or meet with developers and convince them to write Macintosh versions of their software as well as hardware manufacturers, to create peripherals.
so it was basically to proselytize Macintosh to the third-party-developer community.
well, the first time I was there, we were going to change the world, all right?
we're bringing out Macintosh for the first time no one's ever seen it, changing the world.
the second time, obviously, the world had been changed.
perhaps the world had been changed by adopting Windows too.
so the second time was much more dire sort of digging yourself out of a hole.
the first time was just...
it was like being paid to go to Disneyland.
second time was more like, you know, Vietnam.
although I wasrt in Vietnam, so that kind of trivializes it, but, you know, it was a war.
the second tour of duty came when Apple was supposed to die again.
so every 10 years ago, Apple's supposed to die.
and I went back at the height, or depth of these problems.
basically to ensure that the Macintosh cult remained vibrant and alive and cared for.
and so because I couldn't really control any medium I started an e-mail list server which had at its peak about 44, 000 subscribers.
and it was only good news.
so one could make the case that I was blogging before anybody else knew what blogging was.
I just didn't know it. So I had a very big list.
forty-four thousand for, you know... Even today, 44, 000 would be a big list......but it was very big back then. And I would just push out good news.
and it became a source of information so that software developers would send us notices and special offers and all that, then we'd push it to the community.
and the community would then push it out to the rest of the people.
a Guy Kawasaki law is sales fixes everything.
so when you have great sales, everybody gets along. Life is good.
everybody's a visionary. You know, everybody thinks it's good, right?
when sales sucks, everything sucks.
so sales were sucking.
so Apple was divided into factions.
there was the Jean-Louis Gassee faction and the Bill Campbell faction.
and that kind of tore the company apart.
and the reason why I survived all this is because I never really joined either camp.
now, you could make the case......that that means that I was this neutral wimp......but I just... I didn't see the world divided that way.
and so I got along with Sculley and I got along with Jobs.
I got along with Amelio. I got along with everybody.
one of the reasons is because I'd never wanted any of their jobs.
all right? So Sculley wanted to be Steve. Gassee wanted to be Sculley.
bill Campbell wanted to be... I don't know who he wanted to be.
but, you know, that's one of the things that's pathetic about Silicon Valley is everybody wants to be something they're not.
and if you're the venture capitalist, you wanna be the entrepreneur.
me, I just wanna be a hockey player, okay?
so everybody wants to be something they're not.
and at the time, that was rampant at Apple.
when I got started was 1979, when I took spare parts and built an Apple II.
I tried to figure out how I could attach musical instruments to the computer which led to why I needed to learn how to write code, which led to quitting college, which then led to getting a job and then over the years, that turned into getting hired at Apple.
I was sort of informally in the QuickTime group as I was a formal member of the OS team although I didn't really report too well into that group.
we were always kind of a renegade kind of a group. But we got shit done.
but the work was the Sound Manager, which was this complete rewrite that ended up fixing a lot of problems and imported it from all this nasty assembly code and rewrote it in C, and made it actually go like 10 times faster.
and then right about the same time we got the Sound Manager working, I started working inside of the moonlight hours over in the forbidden zone of what the QuickTime guys were doing.
they were hiding out in the Networking building.
and the original idea was, "Now we got these CD-ROMs."
they're not just bigger floppies. What can we do with them?
I know. Let's make movies.
and so that's where the postage-stamp movie idea came from was you couldn't put one on a floppy, but you could put one on a CD-ROM.
so, you know, taking advantage of the new media.
so that was the basic idea for QuickTime.
and then that invented all these other ideas of how do you compress audio, how do you compress video, how do you stream it, how do you play it, how do you synchronize it, how do you do all these things in real time, how do you control it?
and then QuickTime turned into this entire industry based upon that basic idea.
the people on the outside think that, you know , it's like this wonderful world of Oz or Disney going on and all of us are just all these brilliant, amazing, happy people.
and it's not. It's like a sausage factory, man.
you really don't wanna know how this stuff happens.
a lot of it is just bad arguments and politics and working around the rules and not doing the right thing and apologizing for it later, getting fired a few times.
I mean, that's how things got done.
it's definitely, like, don't pay attention to the man behind the curtain.
there's a lot of that stuff.
and you really don't wanna know how this stuff is built.
to me, it's embarrassing, like, there's always big flaws to a lot of the stuff, you know?
there was a computer that we shipped where the speaker's magnet was right next to the hard drive.
now, when you played a sound, it caused the hard drive's read-write head to misalign.
so in the midst of, like, playing your QuickTime movie your computer would completely freeze because it played a sound.
and I'm like, "What kind of engineers do we have around here that would put a magnet right next to your hard drive?"
Jesus Christ, it's just a... It beeped and it crashed, you know?
then they wanted me... This was the solution.
they wanted me to change the decibels of the speaker so that it wouldn't interfere with the hard drive.
you're kidding me.
that's classic. See, you know, engineers are retarded.
they have some kind of brain damage that allows them to not have social skills so that they could concentrate long enough to write code.
but it's a disease.
that's why I had to quit. I mean, I'm like an engineer in recovery.
I don't wanna write code anymore.
it just makes you retarded.
I mean, get a girlfriend.
get a life.
there were times when it was more difficult, you know, when Microsoft was at its strongest.
Yeah, when I think about comparing Microsoft and Apple, I think about the basic values of the company being almost diametrically opposed.
they have managed to distinguished themselves as the company that isn't Microsoft.
and I think there's a lot of Mac users who choose to use a Mac for that reason, that isn't a Windows machine.
I've used Windows to the extent that I've had to use Windows.
and I just cannot understand some stuff there.
I've hated Windows for a number of years and I could never figure out why.
and about three years ago, it finally hit me that the reason I hated it was because it always makes me feel stupid.
I go to do something it gives me a warning that I don't understand, it's cryptic.
but, you know, Microsoft was one of the first big developers for Apple.
I mean, they made a fortune developing software for Apple.
and also for the Mac. They're one of the first big Mac developers as well.
as far as the PC users and Mac users being compared?
I really feel that there is a lot of give-and-take in the PC users' world, but that the PC users really get off on how complicated it is.
it makes them feel superior when they sit down with somebody and totally confuse them.
and, you know, not every PC user is like that , but the ones that I have talked to basically just love to rattle on technical information at a mile a minute because it makes them look good.
everything that, you know, went into Office, I think were initially purchased from other companies and developed for the Mac.
and then, of course, you know, rolled into Windows.
and then they... You know, I mean Bill Gates saw that the Mac operating system was the way to go.
and Windows, you know, 3. 1 borrowed heavily from that, and then Windows 95, 10 years later.
the rest is history.
to start us off in the right direction is an individual who really needs little introduction.
after all... After all...
steve Jobs has been around since the very first Macintosh.
so please join with me now and welcome, from Apple Computer Steve Jobs.
thank you.
the last several weeks, we have looked at some of the relationships.
and I'd like to announce one of our first partnerships today, a very, very meaningful one.
and that is one with Microsoft.
one of the things that I hear over and over again always from Windows people, of course is that Microsoft saved Apple from certain doom by giving them $150 million.
well, if you look at the whole story, Steve negotiated agreement where Microsoft agreed to produce Office for another five years.
apple wasrt gonna compete with them.
at the same time, Microsoft made an investment of $150 million in Apple stock that particular day.
that served two purposes:
one, it made it look like Microsoft was confident in Apple's survival because they wouldn't have bought stock if they didn't.
and secondly, it kind of cemented the agreement that we're not only sure you're gonna be successful with this product, we're gonna back it up by buying some stock so we're part of it.
we're not only a competitor in producing software, we're a partner and owning stock.
what most people don't tell you is that they didn't need the money for Microsoft to survive, this was all a marketing game.
and a lot of Windows people don't understand that.
microsoft didn't save Apple.
and if we wanna move forward and see Apple healthy and prospering again, we have to let go of a few things here.
we have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win Microsoft has to lose, okay?
we have to embrace the notion that for Apple to win, Apple has to do a really good job.
what makes companies very successful and what makes companies fail is the same thing.
it's sort of the passionate adherence to a strategy.
people who are passionately involved in a concept or philosophy a design, a product, all right, will put everything of themselves into it.
and you don't want somebody designing a product who isn't passionate about it.
innovation is...
it's really the only interesting thing. If you're not innovating, what's the point?
when Apple creates through engineering something very cool that people want to buy, it does well.
and when it doesn't, it doesn't.
so, you know, guess what. Newton didn't succeed.
apple III didn't succeed. Lisa didn't succeed.
if you stand back and you look at the Macintosh, the Macintosh line, everything they implement into their computers has personality.
it's like the difference between owning a Ferrari......versus owning, you know, just a Ford Taurus.
you know, it's sleeker style, design, it's fun to drive, you know, versus one that you just use to get to work.
so Macintosh was the mega hit, but what was the first company that really made CD-ROM drives on every computer?
guess what. It was Apple.
guess who democratized 802. 11.
airport and Apple, right?
and so how about FireWire? Who made that a standard?
how about USB?
some companies can think you can innovate too fast because you don't sort of milk the cash cow to the maximum before moving on.
that's not the way Apple usually thinks.
so after a while, it's not just the big hit, it's also...
you know, you can say that these revolutions were caused by little uprisings that Apple, you know, made successful.
the mouse.
now, someone could say, "Well, PARC had the mouse" and all that, but, you know, PARC didn't make it a commercial success.
apple sort of...
and it basically comes from both Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.
they don't really care about that.
sure, they wanna make money, but that's not what it's about.
it's artistic values.
apple wants to do the greatest thing possible.
they don't compare themselves to someone else. Who cares about?
other people can do great things too. That's great.
it's more, like, you know, being transcendently brilliant.
no matter how well you've done it, how can you make it better?
I would like to hear what Jonathan lve would say.
his design is so inspired.
it's like it's divine providence or something.
he has a team of, like, phenomenally talented people and they keep working on a problem until they come up with something fresh and new.
you know, like the scroll wheel on the iPod or that Luxo-looking iMac.
if you look at what Apple does, after it does it one thing you always have to say is:
how come nobody else did this before?" Right?
there's nothing, like, mythical about the iPod and the wheel, right?
anybody could have done that.
you know, the colored iMacs changed design in everything.
you know even on the lids of PowerBooks you know, they open up very smoothly because they have this weird counterbalancing system and no one is ever gonna see this.
it's not something that consumers will actually go out and buy.
so wouldn't you think that some of these computer companies would say:
apple does well because it has beautiful products.
so how much could the most expensive industrial designer in the world cost?
you know, a million dollars a year in salary?
two million dollars a year? Five million dollars?
that's what makes these products so beautiful that level of commitment and dedication to the thing to make it the best thing possible.
I'll tell you what, I'll take it to Fry's and I will you show you lines of crap.
ugly portables, ugly towers, ugly monitors, ugly MP3 players.
why is that?
I guess in a sense, it proves the point that these people don't know what to steal.
they don't know what to steal.
they seem to be all kinds of different people.
you think that the prototypical Mac users seem to be like the graphic designer, you know, who lives in New York or San Francisco, is liberal, you know, young, sort of hip.
you know, there's a lot of different age groups, a lot of different income brackets.
a lot of people who are in a lot of different jobs, a lot of different professions.
although Apple would like you to think that everybody is a young buck that's 20 years old that has a Mac the truth is most of the user group members are between 55 and a hundred years old.
well, I think the Apple community has stayed remarkably consistent.
it's people who love good engineering, they love product design.
they love being different. No pun intended.
they love probably being the underdog.
but then you ask marketers... You know, there are marketing guys and they're convinced that Apple is a brand.
and it conjures up brand associations of creativity and liberty, freedom.
and people are buying into the brand, the way they buy a Coke or beer or a car or a pair of sneakers.
it says something about them and their personality.
so I think people might be a little more attracted to the rebelliousness of it.
I mean, you're the anti crowd anyway because you don't have a PC, right?
for a lot of people, it's a revelation when they go to Macworld to see other users.
it's amazing. They never knew all these people were out there.
Yeah, actually, I went to my first Macworld this year which turned out to be a good one to go to.
that was when they introduced the iPhone.
so actually, what I wanna do... Switch over to Danny.
Hey, Danny.
people take their vacations at Macworld.
that'll be like a weeks' vacation just to go to Macworld.
probably 15th.
I missed last year and Janet and I, my wife, we really regretted it because we really like coming here and meeting with people.
you know, I've seen people show up with these giant suitcases.
these huge suitcases, you know, the ones on wheels, empty.
just for all the crap they're gonna collect at Macworld.
all that leaflets and the freebies and the buttons.
I did get my T-shirt, yeah. That I made sure of.
it's just like being on a casino floor at Las Vegas.
you know, without the cigarette smoke or the drinks.
so you're horribly sober and people are barging into you and screaming and shrieking.
you know, I've been at Macworld and Jobs will whip out, you know, some new machine.
and my God, I've gotta have that machine.
even though I've already got six computers.
I've gotta have that one he's just unveiled.
Why? Because it's faster, or it's got a silver case or it's got, you know, Bluetooth built-in or something just crazy and stupid, really.
but I got to have that machine.
so just before Apple is about to open a brand-new store a lot of people will camp out outside just for the honor of being the first inside.
there are lot of people who are really passionate about it.
when they open the Apple store, I went out there was 3-, 400 people who camped out overnight to get into the store..
and then by the time they opened it, there was several thousand.
I figure, 2-, 3-, 4000 people.
and they were wrapped around the block, you know, a couple of times.
and before Apple had Mac stores, you know, across the country a lot of people would go hang out at their, like, mom-and-pop Apple store.
people would come in with their broken down computer......intending just to drop it off, but they'd end up staying all day.
they start bullshiting, talking to the other people, they would meet other people who are like.
they don't have anything in common, except they're Mac users and that's enough.
you know, to cement it for them.
Yeah, this is a ma-and-pa business, absolutely.
and I couldn't have three stores without them.
one of my stores is managed by my oldest son who's 27.
he manages the Ventura store.
my wife manages this store while I manage the Woodland Hills store.
I have two daughters who are teenagers.
Jessica works here regularly, Kayla comes over and kind of participates.
my little boy, he works here daily. He mans the little kid's station.
this is definitely his operation.
you know, he captures the attention of most women and all kids.
at one point, I became a real Mac person because...
I'm not sure how it happened, but... - Okay. How are you doing?
they were just computers and all of a sudden I realized, you know, I am a Mac advocate. I do push this stuff.
not just trying to sell it because it's my business but because they work well. I don't bang my head on them.
stop it, that's not nice.
so here's what's happening, there is a sound mike right there.
every time you talk, you interfere with it. - It's in there.
sorry.
this was my first foray into retail. - Look how cute I am.
successful?
I'm putting everything back into it, working to make it successful.
so this started out just as an idea.
I'm trying to figure out new ways to advertise.
first I tossed it out to the guys in the Apple specialist group.
and I got maybe three or four responses from people who have done similar things.
I didn't see any pictures of full-car wraps.
but I looked on the web and I saw all kinds of cars that were wrapped with full-body designs, and I liked it.
it seemed like it could work.
I'm trying to become a retailer and learning new things about it.
the big box guys don't entertain me when I go into their stores but they've got mountains of product.
they've got negotiating power, the likes of which I can never imagine.
but hopefully we give a little bit better experience.
ninety percent of the things I do doesn't work.
hopefully, the 10 percent that works...
it seems like it's paying for itself. Pushing things forward, so...
I'm gonna keep on trying.
people like us keep the machines around for so much longer.
I mean, I don't think PC owners really do that.
but, you know, a Mac user...
they'll keep an old machine around forever if it's lights are still running.
we've all got old Macs, like, you can't bear to throw away in a basement, or in a cupboard somewhere in the attic.
they're hard to part with. You figure one day you're gonna dust them off do something with them. You never do.
they just sit, rotting away. There's a lot of people that collect them.
but some of them are more serious than others.
okay.
up first, this is our G3 monitor. Very rare.
when this came in... A friend of mine brought it in.
it's the first time I'd ever seen it.
I didn't even know that Apple made it, but it was... Got the Apple logo on it.
and it was made for the G3 tower.
this is Apple's entry...
it's got the Apple logo on it. - Into the portable printer...
you recognize, these?
black with the Bell + Howell name on them.
apple made it for Bell + Howell.
and they were mainly education.
I started buying a couple of these machines from people I know.
and then refurbishing them.
here's my II Plus that I purchased originally, way back when.
I replaced my Apple II Plus with an Apple llc.
I should've thrown the II Plus away, but never did.
no, this is like our conference room that is...
I ran out of space to fix my laptops, so I started fixing them in here.
I didn't wanna see a nice room go to waste, so I put more stuff in it.
in education, this is probably one of the biggest ones, these Microzines.
where it's like a magazine and a diskette.
almost every school had these.
here's my 20th anniversary and everybody's favorite, the Cube.
here's a cool machine, Mac mini.
they hit a home run when they made this.
here's something that's...
Three-and-a-half-inch diskettes, still shrink-wrapped.
they have the old, old, old Apple logo.
apple's had several different logos over the years.
and that's one of the old ones.
you may think it's an Apple lle, but when you take this cover off, you may still think it's an Apple lle, but it's not.
apple llGS before the llGS cases were made.
anything interesting over here?
no.
and the I bought a lle.
then I bought a lle with a numeric keypad.
I should've been throwing these away, but never did, so maybe that was my training.
junk. That's a long name for junk.
back here, we made some kind of attempt at putting things on shelves.
dual drives.
the Apple 51/4s. The Apple 31/2s.
some Apple printers. Apple keyboards, Apple mice.
original boxes that are empty that I just ain't got the heart to throw away.
just don't film my butt as I'm going up here.
Oh, I won't, I won't. - Just watch your step up here, Rob.
okay, we're in the bowels of the building, up in the rafters.
there was too much nice space up here that we didn't wanna waste.
so we built little shelves so we could put all our lle's, II Pluses.
and it looks like critters have been up here because some have fallen down on the insulation.
apple II monitors, GS monitors, and every single one works.
they were tested before we put them up here.
back here is a storage shed.
it was meant to hold the things that were in my basement.
and luckily we built a little bit bigger than what I intended.
these things are going on eBay...
I've seen them as high as, 6-, 700 bucks.
it's not ever been a money issue, collecting or disposing of the Apples.
it's probably a sickness that I have.
I have the 128 Mac in hiding.
a lot of the SEs, SE/30s.
classics.
only a couple Color Classics.
Six-thousand square feet building and this is only maybe less than half of what I have.
there are probably other Mac people out there same boat as I am, that just won't throw this stuff away.
so I see all these complaints about Cult of Mac.
what are...? It's not a cult. This a rational choice.
and these are all these new Windows people that have just come onboard.
you know, and are sort of defensive about it a little still.
because their other Windows friends who haven't crossed over yet.
there's that Macintosh cult following.
you don't get a following for nothing, you know? You get a...
if it's a good product and it makes people excited...
you can have lots of good products.
they are lots of good products. I got a skillet and it's good.
but I'm not crazy about the skillet.
well, it's always been kind of interesting.
there's definitely a fanatical sort of zealotry of Mac people.
you know? It's not a religion. It's a computer.
I got a lawn mower too, but I don't sit around talking about it.
Yeah, I mean...
so I cut my grass, whatever, you know?
I type a Word document.
it's a screwdriver or it's a blender, you know, like whatever.
you know, I'm not really in love with my Mac.
I like a good movie more than I do a good Mac, you know.
I like good beverages more than my computer.
I watch the rumor sites like a hawk.
and I was a little more lucky this time because my Blue and White G3, we got it and then the G4 came out two weeks later. It's like, "What?"
look how they're suing bloggers now, you know for revealing some details about a very insignificant product.
although, it's a problem that's plagued the company, this kind of rumor control.
I get between 2500 and 3000 unique visitors a day.
and which is, you know, for the fact that I'm just putting up goofy little jokes about a computer company, I think that's pretty good.
I was a pretty avid reader of rumor sites for a long time.
and, you know, usually, I mean, pretty much through the late part of the '90s.
and constantly checking on what Apple's gonna do next, that kind of thing.
and then it sort of hit me that...
I think around the time that one of them predicted that there was gonna be a crank-powered iBook that these guys didn't necessarily know what they were talking about.
I think they also just got worse when Steve Jobs came back because he cracked down on the leaks that were going out to these sites.
and so they were probably actually better during the mid-90s, they were probably more accurate.
I've actually gotten, you know...
been fortunate enough to have some contact with some of the Apple executives who apparently read the site on a fairly regular basis and e-mail me when they find something particularly amusing.
there's one person who I can mention since he's not there anymore, was Avie Tevanian who was the chief technologist at Apple.
and I had written... I had written a story about him going into puberty again.
and just how he was sulking around the office and, you know, kind of shuffling around.
and he wouldn't do any work, and, you know...
and Steve was just having a terrible time with him and didn't know what to do.
and so, you know, I usually end up writing...
publishing the stories at night. And then I go, you know, pretty much go right to bed.
and so I woke up the next morning and there in my Inbox was this e-mail from Avie Tevanian and I thought:
but he was a very good sport about it. He was amused.
and I managed to avoid any litigation.
well, I mean it really...
you know, I didn't start out with any goal other than I just found myself writing these things anyway and I wanted a place to publish them.
so there was no grand plan in mind.
I never thought that I was gonna make any money doing it.
and I do manage to actually make at least a little bit of money doing it.
keeps me off the streets.
the idea of a start-up sound was from the Apple II.
the Apple II once it reset, made a little beep with the square wave speaker.
so we thought that was a great idea. Let's the computer know it's...
let's the world know it made it, like an infant's first cry.
the very first one we did for the earliest Mac prototypes...
we had a square-wave sound generator built into the early Mac prototypes.
we later got rid of that.
so I made a thing that incremented the frequency with...
you know, I tweaked the delay so it made a whooping sound.
the first original boot sound was more like something like:
or whatever. And it was a little comical, but it wasrt very elegant.
and so I was experimenting with different things for the boot sound but a guy named Charlie Kellner had just joined the Mac Team who's also a brilliant musician and he had actually designed one of the first PC-based synthesizers called the alphaSyntauri for the Apple II.
he was an accomplished musician and he kind of looked what I was doing messing around with different boot sounds.
I guess for the time I was doing it, everyone could just hear it.
you know, trying this, trying that.
and he said... Oh, he had an algorithm he always wanted to use.
that was... It's not conceptually musical.
it's more conceptual at the algorithm level which was just filling sound buffer with a square wave.
and then just making passes through averaging every adjacent sample till they got to be all the same.
and that made a chiming, bell-like sound.
it was in the Mac, you know, starting in 1984 and it lasted up until the Mac II where once again, they put in even more sophisticated sound hardware and they came up with a different sound that I wasrt involved with.
well, the start-up sound, let me think... Well, the main inspiration was how horrible the one on the Mac II was.
so a tritone is the most dissonant sound you could imagine.
and stack four of them together.
and that was the sound that you heard when you turned on the Mac.
which was horrible. And so I set out trying to change that because it didn't make any sense.
especially when you usually hear the start-up sound after it crashed.
and so I'm like, "Great, reward for a crash."
so the sound that I wanted to do turned out to be, politically, a challenge.
no one wanted to change it. They thought of it as the brand.
there was this new machine that we were building at the time called the Quadra.
and the Quadra was going to have better speakers.
and then I'm like, "Great, horrible sound on better speakers."
and so I started working on new sounds that would be the sound of...
I kind of thought of it as:
what's the palette cleanser for a crash?
Plus, it was this new, bigger, badder machine and I wanted it to sound like a bigger, badder machine.
I remember when Byte magazine did the review.
the very opening paragraph of the review was:
I knew it was gonna be a good computer by the way it sounded.
so I was like, "I did it."
that was the actual goal, was I wanted it to sound like a good computer.
and then unfortunately, what happened was no one wanted to change the sound.
we ended up just doing it.
and after that everybody changed the start-up sound with every new ROM which was exactly the opposite problem.
you can't establish your brand if you keep changing your logo with every release.
and so, you know, these sonic logos or earcons where, you know, that should be a recognizable sound.
right about the same time Steve Jobs came back, I heard...
the story I heard was he had said, "Let's go back to that good sound."
and that was the one that I had done and so it's still been there.
it's the same one. It's the only one that's ever been there since.
so, I mean, it's kind of cool to hear it every time, I mean...
I never really think about it, millions of people crashing and hearing me play the C-major chord.
no, it was a widespread C-major chord with a high E, I think, in the upper voice which, to me, just sounds more bright and sort of unresolved, but happy.
it's a happy chord.
it's way better than a tritone.
one psychologist said that, you know, people form a social relationship with their machine.
it becomes like a friend, it becomes personalized.
it seems a little silly but you kind of build up a relationship with your computer.
and it can either be a good relationship or it can be a dysfunctional relationship.
you can customize any computer system but these are very easy to develop a relationship with.
that's different from customizing.
they're the closest devices that I know of that are really symbiotic.
and I'll admit it, you know, when they...
when they do make it so that you can kind of jack in neurally, l'll do that.
Yeah, I think maybe somebody needs to sit down with those people.
maybe it's Dr. Phil.
your computer doesn't love you.
this relationship is not working.
don't be an enabler.
their soul is somehow reflected in that machine.
it's an object of communication, but also of creativity.
you know, the most essential things that they are the things that express themselves, are expressed through the computer.
and so they invest, you know, so much in that, that it's a cybernetic relationship.
when Steve came back, he was like, "Hey, you know, we should get into this music thing."
I mean, he saw it.
but to me it was, like, five years late, like that was obvious five years earlier.
I think Apple could be as big as Sony right now, if it had been five years earlier.
a phone? Finally? Whatever.
a couple of years ago when they...
apple said it was gonna come through with some breakthrough device, there was a lot of speculation about what this might be.
people figured it was a music player, but exactly what, no one knew.
and people were saying on the forums they were gonna buy it anyway.
it didn't matter. They were gonna get it because it was gonna be fucking great.
the iPod people have had the iPods in their pocket mainly because they love music.
and that's... And as do the Apple employees who created it.
you know, people complain about it, but it's...
the fact that they were able to make the iPod is actually why...
you know, one of the reasons why Macs are still around.
it's only really clear when you compare it to other products.
they're a pain in the ass to use. I mean, they are impossible.
there are more iPods in my house than there are people.
by probably 2-to-1.
but I never use an iPod.
I have five.
I think I have five or we have five. The family has five, I think.
you know, that's like this whole video thing on your iPod. Who cares?
I thought we used to complain about postage-stamp movies.
I mean, that was the complaint we had 16 years ago and it's back to the future.
I got this iPod. What am l...?
a movie on an iPod. I don't even get it.
like, you think, "How long can I hold this up in front of my face before my arm gets tired?
I mean, I can't even get through one TV sitcom.
progress.
a big part of Apple's marketing budget was, like, sticking the machines in movies and TV shows.
you know, so it culminated with...
what was it called? Independence Day.
when the PowerBook taps into the alien computer and blows up the alien ship.
they paid, you know, tens of millions of dollars, I believe, to do that.
this is when product placement was starting to become big business in Hollywood.
but since then, you know, you see them all over the place.
I mean, they are all over TV.
you know, part of it is product placement, part of it is because Macs are popular in Hollywood, you know.
obviously, they're used for video editing.
I've edited somewhere between 40 and 50 movies.
television, theatrical movies.
no documentaries.
richard Halsey Los Angeles, California
we'll, I'll start with my calling card: Rocky, Down and Out in Beverly Hills, The Net, Payday, one of my favorite movies.
I was a very successful film editor.
editing mechanically with German machines KEMs, Steenbecks, Moviolas, whatever.
everything you can imagine.
every piece of mechanical equipment you can imagine, I used.
well, I wanted to move forward into computers but believe it or not, they were reluctant to.
they still thought it was cheaper to edit the old mechanical way.
I had experimented around with the Lucas system，the Laserdisc system. That thing was ridiculous.
the Montage, that was ridiculous.
and the Lightworks, that was sort of starting to happen.
and basically, it wasrt till 1995 which was late in the game.
and mostly at that point, early '90s it was, you know, the Avid.
I went and I had to do a picture, a Columbia Picture, a Sandra Bullock picture called The Net.
had a very short post-production schedule.
I had no experience, had no idea what I was doing.
within three hours, I had the basic principles down.
so it was a good system.
I continued editing on that system for at least seven, eight years.
and then I jumped into Final Cut.
and I've been editing in Final Cut, you know, ever since.
I mean, it's an amazing system.
take a simple film like Edward Scissorhands.
we were editing mechanically.
I was editing with my wife.
well, we went to location with four KEMs.
I was editing, she was editing.
and then we had a husband and wife team.
they were our assistants.
so there was four of us and that was really economical.
and we had four editing machines, and we were able to keep up with camera.
we were able to get a Christmas release and do the movie quite quickly.
with this system, I'm pretty much a one-man band and my assistant.
I can do the job of six or seven editors in the old system.
well, you can see. I mean, look at the environment now.
instead of editing in 1200 square feet, I can edit in 200 square feet.
apple is Steve Jobs, for sure.
I mean, he is the one who defines the company.
he founded it, but I mean, look at its recent history.
he has his personality stamped all over it.
I used to say about Steve that he was the best person possible to work for and also the worst because he's a man of extremes. Steve's extremely passionate.
he's incredibly sharp.
he's, more than anything else, incredibly quick.
he's got the quickest mind of anyone I've ever talked to.
Yeah, I mean, I idolize Steve Jobs. He's absolutely, you know, one of my...
he's my favorite celebrity, but I don't pretend that I'd understand what would come out of his mouth if I asked him a question.
I cannot explain how Steve comes up with these things because he has a different operating system.
so mere mortals cannot understand him.
that's why when people try to understand him and his quirks and all of that, they get very frustrated because you can't.
it would be like telling a fish how to understand how a bird feels flying.
it cannot be. The fish is stuck in the water, the bird is soaring.
it's a different operating system. That's what it is.
I think Apple is his place in the world.
this is where it all began.
and obviously, it's... You know, it's a piece of himself.
it's a company that seems like it needs somebody who's not just your ordinary CEO to run it.
they've tried a number of ordinary CEOs in the '90s and it just didn't work.
because if you look at the time era that Jobs was not there, Apple fell into a category where their Macs were just becoming like everyday computers.
and there was nothing special about them.
but of course Steve Jobs has an incredibly strong aesthetic in case you can't tell.
I don't think you could change the DNA of Apple if you tried.
so Apple's DNA is in building cool stuff, it's an engineering company.
they can say they're marketing and all that.
but a marketing-driven company is a company that theoretically listens to the market and delivers what the market says it wants.
you could say many things about Apple, but that ain't one of them. Okay?
they don't listen to anybody.
apple's idea of market research is, you know, Steve's right hemisphere is connected to his left hemisphere.
that's the focus group.
immediately when Jobs came back, the first thing he did was the iMac.
he set the personality, he set the tone of the computer. He's like:
here. We're gonna break boundaries, we're gonna take it to the next level, the next edge."
you could make the case that Apple III wasn't his, and Newton wasn't his, and Lisa wasn't his.
so the only time it flubbed or stubbed its toe was when Steve wasn't behind it.
I don't see Apple being able to continue at the pace that it's going right now.
I mean, I don't expect it to suddenly, you know, fumble and fall but it's not gonna be what it is now.
no, the problem is going to be post-Steve.
if you bring in some dickhead who thinks that he's mini-Steve and he, too, is a visionary and, he, too understands what people need, but cannot express.
so this dickhead is gonna say:
all right, so this is what I've decreed people will want.
and I'm the new Steve Jobs.
the company will implode.
that depends on whether or not the philosophy employed by Steve in focusing on product and having a passionate view of the product and it's relationship to the rest of the operating enterprise.
if they get somebody like that in there then it will continue as an ever-growing, ever-expanding, ever-creative enterprise.
well, that's interesting.
you know, that's an interesting thought. I don't know.
whether it just... Apple's just gonna stagnate, you know?
well, the story, and I don't know if it's true but when you went into the HP lobby, there was H's portrait and P's portrait.
and when Carly came in, she put her portrait, okay?
you know what I'm coming to, right?
I mean, you hire some dickhead who does that it's game over, baby.
we'll all be listening to Zunes and using Windows machines.
if they get a bottom-line man in there, it may succeed but it will never have the aura and the passion that it has today.
you can trace the greatness of Apple pretty closely back to the greatness of Steve.
some of the flaws of Apple as well.
I can't build a case that it's going to be easy to find another Steve Jobs.
it may not be that you want another Steve Jobs because there can be no other Steve Jobs.
the Macintosh spirit was not something we created with the Macintosh although we sort of contributed to it. But it was there before the Macintosh because it's really the spirit of the Apple II.
and so much of the spirit of the Apple II is the spirit of Steve Wozniak's personality as well as Steve Jobs'.
you know, the core of Apple is to change the world.
and that has not changed. I don't think it can.
I don't think it could change if you tried to change it.
in a broader sense, some of that spirit of the Apple II was the spirit of the personal computer revolution.
and really what that is, more than anything else is the celebration of unbounded possibility.
the key thing... Those first microcomputers even pre-Apple II, but even the Apple ll's couldn't really do much.
yet they were incredibly exciting because you knew they were the seed that would change the world.
and if you look at Steve and Woz, what they did is they created Apple I which was to change the world.
apple II changed the world.
macintosh changed the world.
ipod changed the world and maybe this phone will change the world.
so, you know, that's five things. You can't call that luck.
we filled the machine with our love and passion for what we were doing.
and it radiates out on the other side of the screen and it affects the user.
a lot of people were shown Apple computers in schools.
apple's very, very prominent in schools and therefore people that have gone through the school systems into college have just stuck with Apple.
the ones that see it as a truly superior product, which it can be.
well, we're like all other user groups. We got together because, you know, stuff was really expensive, you couldn't afford much.
and quite frankly, almost every user group in the world started out as a pirate group and became legitimate.
the commercial is great. The commercial is fantastic.
I then edited Pirates of Silicon Valley many years later and the movie started off with that same commercial.
well?
Oh, my... - Oh, God, not...
now, I don't have... Oh, shit.
another thing Burrell and I would do every day in the earlier days of the project when we were at Texaco Towers is before we were doing something healthy, we would go across the street to Cicero's Pizzeria and play "Defender.
for one thing I'm living proof, if you do one thing right in your career, you can coast for a long time.
a long time.
do you think Steve Jobs is gonna be willing to sit down and talk to us?
sit down and talk to you? No.
Oh, I didn't wanna tell you this but Steve was in here about four months ago and spent part of a day, about three hours here.
but I'll make a prediction, and my prediction is you will not talk to Steve Jobs for this documentary.
no, that's good. That's... I'm glad that he...
probably, probably would say no.
that depends on the mood he's in when you try to talk to him.
if you hit him on a good day, it's, "Come on in."
come down, we'll go to dinner.
I mean, half the time he's not willing to sit down and talk to CNNfn.
you know what I mean? He...
I think he bolted out of one of those interviews a couple of years ago.
you get him on a bad day, it's, "Sorry, I haven't got time for this."
presuming you don't go skidding down the stairs on your hindquarters.
the only way you could hook him would be to show him some of the film.
I called him up and asked him to come visit when he had a chance.
you're fibbing, of course. - I am fibbing.
okay. That was good.
okay. That was good.
had enough?
steve will not talk to the New York Times usually.
it might be better even if you didn't have him.
it might be better... - That was a discussion, yes.
if you had a, like a cloaked figure behind the background.
you know what I mean? And this was the mysterious Jobs.
you know?
I shouldn't tell you this, but he lives walking distance from here.
you could go stake out the house. - No, he'd probably call on us.
Yeah, he probably would. - Yeah, that's the thing.
no, its not!
what is this madness?
I have feIt this mad since...
you kiIIed my brother Ramesh and his fiancee.
Ramesh! Your brother?
yes...
and I didn't kiII you tiII now because...
I wanted you to remember why you were being kiIIed!
you don't know this but...
I didn't kiII your brother.
good bye Don.
stop! That's enough...
look! Look at me.
listen carefuIIy.
you didn't kiII me aII these days...
... and for that, I thank you.
now Iisten to the truth.
the truth is...
the truth is...
he...
...is not Don.
who can say that he is not Don!
besides Vijay and me now...
...onIy you know the truth.
where is the disc?
I'm sorry.
I thought that...
no, it doesn't matter.
anyone in your pIace...
... wouId have been deceived.
Mr. DesiIva...
your work is done?
no...
my work isn't done yet.
that too wiII happen.
Singhania is coming here.
Yes, sir.
he is coming to KuaIa Lumpur for a meeting.
I'II inform you of the Iocation as soon as I know.
good.
you may have done this for Deepu's sake but...
... neither me nor the poIice wiII ever forget this favor.
who is Deepu?
vijay uncle...!
don't you recognize me?
how can I not recognize you?
my... Deepu!
but, honestIy...
... for one second I did wonder, " who is this smart young gentIeman running towards me? "
this new uniform!
new shoes.
weII uncle, you aren't the same either!
what can I say, Deepu?
your Vijay uncle...
...had to change.
but what about your paan?
paan is gone!
just a minute...
roma, this is Deepu.
hi Deepu.
nice to meet you.
HeIIo... me too...
and Deepu, this is Roma aunty.
uncle, is she your auntytoo? - Hey! Is that anyway to speak!
the things you are doing for this boy...!
who does this in today's time?
if anything wouId have happened to you today...
...I wouId never forgive myseIf!
pIease forget aII about it.
anyway...
I don't know...
... ShouId I be gratefuI to Don for making it possibIe to meet you.
or I shouId hate him.
because I wonder...
...how you can even sit beside a man...
who constantIy reminds you of your brother's death.
I can't punish you for a crime committed by someone eIse.
and pIease.
stop addressing me so formaIIy.
what do I caII you then?
aunty?
excuse me...
HeIIo...
there is some Mr. Jasjit Ahuja here to see you sir.
how are you, Haatim? - Very weII.
what a surprise?
my God, it's been ages since we met!
BangaIore 2002.
before you came here.
ReaIIy!.
how time fIies!
UnbeIievabIe!...
what brings you here?
DCP DesiIva is in this city right now.
yes...
I heard about what happened to you...
...I'm sorry.
I couIdn't do anything for you.
but you can now.
I want his address, Haatim.
what do you pIan on doing?
what time is the meeting?
and Singhania wiII be there?
good... I'II see you then.
weII done!
weIcome back!...
perhaps you don't know who I am?
I know you very weII.
DCP DesiIva.
who are you?
think back!
9th January, BeIcourt Towers?
10 miIIion doIIars worth of diamonds?
No!
weII, maybe a buIIet couId heIp sharpen your memory.
hang on!...
yes...
what do you want?
I want to kiII you!
I hope you won't mind too much!
look, Jasjit...
maybe what happened to you was wrong...
I was onIy doing my duty.
I'm a poIice officer...
... and right now it's cruclaI for me to be somewhere.
or eIse some big criminaIs wiII get away.
let me go!
how can I Iet you go?
look at these faces!
one of them is my wife...
who is dead because of you.
the other is my innocent son!
who knows where he is now?
look at them...
this boy...
is your son?!
you know Deepu?
Yes. I aIso know where he is...
...but wiII teII you that, onIy after I come back.
wrong!
you wiII teII me right now!
you can kiII me and take your revenge...
... but then give up the hope that you'II see your son again!
I don't hate you as much...
as I Iove my son.
go.
I wiII wait for you here.
leave that here.
you do have to come back, don't you?
night and wine have met we are intoxicated
body and heart are both ready to meIt
ceIebration surrounds us but yet I am anxious
why does my heart beat faster?
why does my heart say...
... " you fooIs do not know this yet? "
tonight...
who knows what wiII happen?
what wiII we gain?
what wiII we Iose?
tonight...
who knows what wiII happen?
what wiII we gain?
what wiII we Iose?
what wiII happen in just a few moments?
what was aIways mine wiII be mine again.
the night wiII decide who resides in who'sheart
the decision has been made...
...that I wiII be victorious
you fooIs do not know this yet
tonight...
who knows what wiII happen?

move it...!
put your gun down.
open the door.
let him go.

Mr. MaIik! Shoot him! - Shut up.
let him go. Put your gun down.
shoot, Mr. MaIik!
get into the van. Move!
MaIik! Shoot him.
do you want me to shoot him?
ReIax...
cIose the door.
shut the door.
stop!
turn the engine off!
now.!
I mean it.
now!
yes...
OK... Thank you.
what do you think, Verma?
is this man teIIing the truth that he is not Don?
don is very clever, sir.
cIaiming that he is Vijay, Mr. DesiIva's informer...
...is sureIy a pIan to escape punishment.
hmm? Lets do this...
bring Narang and Machere.
let them hear what he's saying.
perhaps his words...
...can break them.
Mr. MaIik, how many times do I have to teII you I'm not Don!
I'm Vijay... DesiIva saheb's informer.
if Singhania's men are behind bars today, it's aII due to me.
and why don't you go ask DesiIva saheb who I am?
DCP DesiIva is no Ionger with us.
he's dead.
dead?
just a minute!
then...
Where's the disc I gave him?
what disc?
I had given him a discthat contained information of Singhania's contacts and bank accounts.
I'm sorry but he didn't mention any such disc.
but it must be somewhere!
...in his apartment or somewhere here...
in his desk... or...
Mr. MaIik!
if I were Don...
...how wouId I know that he had this disc?
DCP DesiIva's informer has toId us quite a Iot about you.
now if there is anything, you two wouId Iike to say?
what are you saying, Mr. MaIik?
this man is Don.
and he is doing what he know's best.
what's that?
making poIice officers Iike you Iook Iike fooIs.
shut up.
take them away.
verma, take a smaII team to DCP DesiIva's apartment.
if that discis there...
...It's possibIe this man is speaking the truth.
he is teIIing the truth.
he is not Don.
MaIik Saheb, I'm teIIing the truth...
I gave De SiIva saheb the discwith my own hands!
you don't beIieve me, do you?
don, I gave you a chance...
but now even you can't deny the fact that you are Don.
I'm sorry.
Verma. just send the guards in!

he operated on me to make me Iook Iike Don.
pIease...! He knows the truth.

so...
behaving a bit too smart, weren't you, boy?!
now get ready to die.
the punishment for seIIing drugs in MaIaysia...

I don't understand.
your testimony wiII prove...
...that this discwas with DCP DesiIva.
DCP DesiIva?!
Yes.
he was the onIy one in the poIice department who knew...

his reaI name is Vardhaan.
and just a IittIe whiIe ago... I met him!
No!
this can't be.
I mean...
your eyes must have deceived you!!
no, I have not been deceived.
DCP DesiIva is Vardhaan!!
he made me pose as Don...
...obtained the disc...
...and a chance to kiII Singhania.
then faked his own death...
...and Ieft me to die as Don.
DCP DesiIva... Vardhaan!
you've pIayed a big move!
but he must never have thought...
...that I'd steaI the disc.
give the discto Vardhaan!
Vijay! What are you saying?
Yes, Roma.
AfinaI meeting with DCP DesiIva is very important.
don't worry, darIing.

I'm going to kiII you today.

I'm ready to send you to any corner of the worId.
think it over.
you must be exhausted running from the poIice!
not as much as from thinking over and over...
...why you betrayed me?
come on, get over it.
what betrayaI?!
this is the reaI worId.
you think Singhania asked me before seizing Boris' entire empire?
I created the entire business! With my inteIIigence and guts.
and now to get it back, I can use thousands Iike you.

I betrayed you.
you want an apoIogy?
I'm so sorry, Vijay!

...unIess you kiII me now.
in that case, Vardhaan...
...I'II be waiting for you.

yeah?
I'm going to go home.
what's wrong?
just one of those days.
my back's killing me. I'll go see Louie.
not again. Your boss will kill you.
what can you do?
well, I'll miss riding home with you.
I was looking forward to it.
easy. My back.
come on, Jake, that didn't hurt.
how do you know?
I know you.
how come you're so tense today?
I don't know. What can I tell you?
I saw Sarah the other day.
Oh, yeah?
her knee acting up?
a bit.
so what did she have to say?
turn on your right side.
how about the other right?
I don't understand you philosophers.
you got the world figured out,
but you can't remember your left.
what did she say?
not much.
she's like you that way
two clams.
no wonder your marriage didn't last.
put your hand on your hip.
take a deep breath...
and let it out slowly, slowly...
that's good.
now turn to your left.
did she talk about the boys?
she said you're a son of a bitch, and she regrets the day she met you.
thought she didn't say much.
that's all she said. Hand on your hip.
take a breath.
easy...
on your back.
I think she still loves you.
I don't think so.
she doesn't stop talking about you.
that's love, Jake.
you should go back to her.
she threw me out, remember?
your problem is you spent six years getting a Ph. D.
then went to work for the post office.
what can I tell you?
after 'Nam', I didn't want to think anymore.
any other brain but yours, I'd agree.
now relax...
relax. This is going to be a little strong.
that a boy.
that a boy.
I found one.
I think he's still alive.
what did you...
what did you do to me?
I had to get in there.
it's a deep adjustment.
rest a moment.
let it set a bit.
I had a weird flash.
what?
I don't know.
I've been having them recently.
you know, you look like an angel, Louie.
like an overgrown cherub.
anyone ever tell you that?
Yeah.
you.
every time I see you.
you're a lifesaver, Louie.
I know.

we don't remember the words. I'm sorry.
look out!
singer?
please, Elizabeth, sit down.
I need to see Dr. Carlson, please.
Carlson?
is he new here?
no, he's been here for years.
not according to my charts.
do you have an appointment?
I need to see him.
I know where his room is.
just give me a pass.
our doctors are seen by appointment only.
damn.
I was in the veterans' outpatient program.
he knows me.
what was your name?
singer. Jacob singer.
I've got a lot of work here.
haven't even had lunch yet.
I'm sorry, but, uh...
what do you mean, no record?
shall I spell it out?
there is nothing there.
that's ridiculous.
I've been coming here for years.
listen to me. I'm--I'm...
I, uh...I need to see Dr. Carlson.
if it's an emergency, we have a staff of psychiatric social workers.
there's an hour's wait.
would you just fill out this form, please?
I don't want any social worker.
I want Dr. Carlson.
he knows me.
Hey! Come back here!
Hey!
Hey, come back here!
Hey!
look out.
get out of here.
Hey, come on!
hold him.
he made it.
can I help you?
Where's Dr. Carlson?
isn't this his office?
be just a minute.
why don't we step out in the hall?
it's ok.
I'm so sorry.
Dr. Carlson died.
died?
it was a car accident.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.
when?
uh, about a month ago.
just before Thanksgiving.
how'd it happen?
no one really knows.
they say it blew up.
blew up?
what do you mean, blew up?
I really don't know.
is there anything I can do for you?
do you...
do you want me to get you someone?
no...
I'm ok.
maybe it's the pressure, Jake.
or your wife.
why do you bring her up?
she's always on your mind.
I never talk about her.
it has nothing to do with talking.
maybe it's the war.
Aw, jezzie, come on.
creatures?
Jake, New York is filled with creatures, and lots of stations are closed.
they're like...
demons, Jezz.
demons?
Jake, honey...
they're winos and bag ladies.
lowlife. That's all they are.
the streets are crawling with them.
don't make them into something they're not, hmm?
kids on a joy ride.
it happens all the time.
they were inhuman.
Oh, come on.
what were they, Jake?
you still love me?
what?
do you love me?
Yeah.
Hey, where are you going?
come with me.
do you have a girlfriend?
do you like her an awful lot?
want a new girlfriend?
I live very close to here, and I'm very lonely.
let me look at your hand.
no, thanks.
go ahead, Jake. Let her.
she's real good.
come on.
it's fun.
you left-handed or right-handed?
Um...right.
give it to me.
Mm-hmm. Married man.
please.
Oh, no.
Oh, divorce.
I like that.
you see this here, that split?
where?
right here.
it's a paper cut.
Ooh, and a sense of humor, too.
I love it.
Hey, Jake, Jake.
come on, baby, dance with me just one, huh?
what, are you flirting?
let's see, this is your heart line...
and your head line.
and your life line.
you have a very strange line, hon.
no, it's not funny.
see, according to this, you're already dead.
you're out of here, baby.
what can you do?
just give me your blue eyes before you go, ok?
wait, wait. Jake, come here.
come on, come on, you can dance.
come on, man, move those legs.
move them size 13s.
those are some big fucking feet. Shit.
Jesus, look at that.
his guts are hanging out.
you'll have to push them back in.
I have never
I have never been so mortified in my whole life.
screaming like that.
I don't understand what's gotten into you, Jake.
you're not acting normal.
there's been too many crazies in my life.
I don't want it anymore.
I'm tired of men flipping out on me.
if you go crazy,
you're going crazy by yourself, you understand?
what's it say?
Oh, my God. I'm calling the doctor.
what's it say?
it's gone to the top.
great.
Dr. Forrest, I'm so sorry to bother you.
this is Jezzie Pipkin up on 14-G.
I just took Jake's temperature, and it says 106.
could that be right?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
get out of bed.
I can't. I'm freezing.
Jake, for Pete's sake, get out of bed!
what did the doctor say?
that you'd die on the way to the hospital.
come on, up, up.
hold on, hold on.
you're going to be ok, Jake.
what are you doing?
I need more ice.
I'm freezing!
what's happening?
I need some ice. He's running a 106 fever.
it's an emergency-- ice.
thank you.
come on, sam.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Jake, oh, Jake, don't you die on me.
Sam, help me!
Sam!
I'll help.
come on.
be careful with him.
hold on.
come on. It's for your own good.
come on, Jake.
come on, get him in there.
you're going to be fine.
hold him! Hold him!
it's going to be ok.
is he all right?
he doesn't like this.
help me!
stop it!
Jake, don't you die on me.
stop it! You're killing me!
shit.
what was that?
I'm freezing.
I'm not cold.
of course not. You have all the covers.
must be 10 degrees in here.
I'm telling you, Sarah...
from now on, that window's closed.
it's not healthy when it's closed.
healthy? You call this healthy?
I'm going to die of pneumonia.
this is healthy?
what a dream I was having.
I was living with another woman.
you know who it was?
I don't want to know.
jezebel from the post office.
you remember her.
you met her at the Christmas Party that time.
I was living with her.
God, what a nightmare.
there were all these demons, and I was on fire.
I was burning from ice.
guilty thoughts.
see what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
she was really good in bed.
go to sleep.
she had these great thighs.
Oh, I thought you said it was a nightmare.
it was.
it was a nightmare.
it was a terrible, terrible nightmare.
daddy, what was that noise?
what are you doing up?
it's cold.
well, tell your mother.
go back to bed, darling.
will you tuck me in?
who, her?
no. Daddy.
shit.
good night, sweetheart.
Oh, God. Come on.
good night, darling.
OK. Close your eyes.
I don't mind the gray skies
you make the moon
blue?
Sonny boy
when I'm old and gray, dear
promise you won't stray, dear
I love you so
Sonny
boy
dad?
Yeah, Jed?
you forgot my allowance.
your allowance?
it's 5: 00 in the morning.
we'll talk about it at breakfast.
all right, but don't forget.
I love you, Dad.
what is this, a convention?
I love you too, Pickles.
go back to sleep.
wait.
don't go.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm right here.
close your eyes.
see you in the morning.
don't shut it.
open it a bit more.
there?
a little bit more.
there?
good.
I love you, Sarah.
watch the head.
move it!
don't think we got a fucking chance down here.
declare an emergency. Over.
you're a lucky guy, Jake.
you must have friends in high places.
Jake?
you're going to be all right, Jake.
Oh, you're going to be fine.
am I...
am I home?
Yeah. You're right here.
home.
doctor says you're lucky your brains didn't boil.
what a night, Jake, huh?
you were screaming and kicking...
and you kept saying, "Sarah, close the window,"
over and over.
and talking to your kids, even the dead one.
weird, huh?
you know you melted 50 pounds of ice in 8 hours?
am I dead?
Oh, no.
no. You're right here.
doctor says you got to rest.
you see, he says you have a virus.
now, you just lie here, ok?
you know, you really ought to get out today.
you can't just sit around like this all the time.
it's not healthy.
it's not good for your mind.
go take a walk or something.
do something.
go to a movie.
go enjoy yourself.
one of us should be having a good time.
anybody in there?
anybody home?
who are you?
fuck you.
two weeks of this shit!
I've had enough.
go ahead and rot if you want.
have a good fucking day.
hello.
Jake?
yeah?
it's Paul. Paul Gruniger.
paul Gruniger.
Paul.
paul Gruniger. Jesus, how are you?
it's been like five, six years.
Yeah. A long time.
so, what's up?
nothing much.
Yeah. Well, same here.
I need to see you, Jake.
I'd love to see you, man,
but I've been laid up. I've been sick.
I need to see you.
all right.
something's wrong, Jake.
I don't know what it is, but I can't talk to anybody about it.
I mean, I figured I could talk to you.
I'm going to hell.
that's as straight as I can put it.
and don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not.
they're coming after me.
who is?
they've been following me.
they're coming out of the walls.
I can't trust anybody.
me too.
okay, help me wind. - Wind back?
can we turn this one? Slowly.
slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly.
I am doing it slowly. - Okay, you got it.
Oh, Matty, look!
you see that big boat out there? - Mm-hmm.
she is the prettiest boat on Whidbey Island. That's the Morning Star.
someday when you're big enough, I'm gonna teach you how to sail.
it's the best thing there is, sailing. - Better than fishing?
Yup. But you know what, kiddo?
I don't think I want you to grow up. - Why?
what if you grow up and marry some beautiful girl?
who's gonna go sailing with me then? - Dad.
not a chance.
thank you so much.
Nick. Uh, we need to talk.
always happy to talk to you, Rudy. Hey, Warren.
did you get that notice from First Seattle today?
Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
good. - Then you know.
we've got a real problem. - First Seattle is not a problem.
these martinis are a problem. Do you mind?
not at all. - Where were we? Right, First Seattle.
mommy? - Hey, kiddo.
how's it going? - Hand off.
Oh, you sack of potatoes. - Ay-yi-yi.
have you been carrying him around the whole party?
Yeah. - We're never gonna marry you, Angie.
mm, yes. Picasso.
blue Period.
the artist's name is Kandinsky.
wassily Kandinsky.
he was German, of Russian extraction, 1866 to 1944.
and by the way, Picasso's Blue Period was figurative,
and ended in 1904.
and these watercolors are abstract, done in 1911.
Picasso.
everyone pipe down. I'm about to give a speech.
thank you for coming. I always say the sign of a good party...
is when I'm having a better time than anyone else, but,
now is the time when you're expected to ante up
for drinking all my liquor, and eating all my food,
and spilling tomato sauce on my couch, Bobby Long.
Ooh... - What, you didn't think I saw you?
Oh, he's insufferable. - I know it.
now, we are here to raise a vast sum of money for the Small Frye School.
so, while you are reaching for your checkbooks...
it gives me great pleasure to introduce Mrs. Rebecca Tingley,
our totally ravishing
and completely adorable Headmistress.
Mr. Parsons, thank you.
first of all, I'd like to start by introducing
a few members of my staff to you today. - Oh, God.
I give you our dedicated teacher and Head of Admissions,
miss Angela Green.
Yea!
me!
what are you thinking about?
was I always as rude as I am now?
Absolutely.
Hi. Come have a seat.
Angela, do you think we ought to break the news to her?
I suppose it's better she hears it from us than from someone else.
she's not gonna be happy about it.
what's up, guys?
close your eyes.
close 'em.
okay, now, stand up.
keep 'em closed.
now, Libby, what is your favorite thing?
me? - Not even close.
all right, open.
I heard Sean Gittman was thinking of selling.
I made him an offer
and he agreed to let us take her out for the weekend.
and if you like it, it's yours.
if I like it? - Mm-hmm.
honey, we can't afford that.
when have I ever let that get in my way? Come on.
huh?
what about Matty?
I'll take care of him. We'll have a great time.
you hate to sail.
I can learn.
huh?
generally, wine like this needs time to breathe...
but I don't know, I don't think we should
wait.
I don't see land.
so where is it?
alaska's over that way, Japan is straight ahead...
and Australia's somewhere to the left.
where would you like to go?
bed.
that can be arranged.
we should do this more often.
what do you mean? Buy expensive sailboats?
if this is what happens, I'll buy another one tomorrow.
no, go away, just the two of us
with nobody else around.
I'll drink to that.
Nick?
Nick?
Oh, my God. Nick?
Nick?
Nick? Ni...
Oh, my God.
Nick?
Nick! Nick!
Nick! Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Nick?
morning Star, this is the Coast Guard.
put the knife down, ma'am, and step away.
I- I don't, I don't know,
I don't know... where my husband is!
search for local businessman
Nick Parsons, who disappeared in these waters off Whidbey Island.
all right, tie it off.
Hey, Cutter. - Hey, Tom. What have you got for me?
anything? - No.
cutter, please don't let them give up. He's very strong.
Libby. L-Libby. - He's a very strong man.
the raft and life preservers are all on board.
these guys, they tracked the wind, currents...
nothing. The water temperature overnight...
was 51 degrees.
that's cold. That's really cold.
cutter, I can't breathe! - Just put your head down.
Yeah, that's it. Deep breaths.
big breaths.
Shh.
mommy, look!
Hi, kiddo.
Hey, Bobby.
Hey, Libby.
um, well, Cutter, he, uh...
he asked me to come by and talk to you, you know.
just, um... Not as an attorney, just as a friend.
the inquest was held this morning, and they reviewed all the evidence...
and Nick, uh, well, he's officially been declared dead.
now, Libby, they, um...
they've determined it was a "wrongful death, and you...
Oh, Jesus, you... You're being formally charged with his murder.
I am here to advise you.
make no statements whatsoever to the sheriff.
I'm sorry, Libby.
cutter!
not in front of my kid, okay?
I'm sorry, Libby. Uh, the judge denied us bail.
can Angie keep looking after Matty?
good. Okay, uh...
let's look at this, see what we can do. - Bobby.
here's what I think happened.
I had some wine, okay?
and I fell asleep. It must have been the sun.
and maybe Nick was trying to cut a snagged line or something...
because the knife...
from the galley was on deck.
and-and maybe the boat pitched or something...
and he cut himself.
and he tried to come downstairs. He tried to come below...
to wake me up.
I quit these things when I met Nick.
it'll be all right. I promise you.
so. Why don't we take a look at this First Guarantee Life?
now. You both bought life insurance policies...
from the company around four months ago.
and you are the beneficiary. - I'm his wife.
Libby, you know this policy is worth two million?
Nick wanted to make sure that if anything happened to him, we'd be okay.
the jury may feel there's a difference between "okay" and $2 million.
they may see it as a motive.
is that what they're saying? - No, no one is saying that.
I don't think we have to be concerned... - That I killed Nick for money?
I know we had some problems, and Nick worried...
but we were okay! - Libby!
two of his investors were suing him for embezzlement.
first Seattle issued a lien on all of his real estate properties...
your personal possessions...
now, Nick's death means all these problems disappear.
behind a corporate shield, leaving you with $2 million.
do you think I killed him? - The first rule of being a lawyer.
what we think doesn't matter.
it matters to me.
no. Of course. I don't think you killed him.
petty Officer Young, what was the condition...
of the Morning Star's marine band radio when you had a chance to inspect it?
the handset cord had been cut.
and as you initially approached the sailboat...
what did you see?
Mrs. Parsons was holding a knife.
I show you State's exhibit... number four.
uh, Mayday. Mayday.
this is the Morning Star.
state your emergency, Morning Star.
I've been stabbed.
I'm bleeding, uh... Oh, Jesus.
my na... My name's Nicholas Parsons.
state your position. - I don't know, man.
three miles northwest of, uh, of Whidbey Island, I guess.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Mrs. Parsons, you've heard the testimony presented to this court.
and your explanation is that somebody must have come aboard the Morning Star.
that's right. - Let's consider all the possibilities.
maybe a band of pirates.
or aliens! Did aliens murder your husband?
no. Aliens weren't beneficiaries in...
your husband's life insurance policy. - Objection.
your Honor, the prosecutor. - Overruled.
I told you what happened. - Yes, you did.
you told us that you were asleep. - Yes.
maybe you were sleepwalking when you stabbed your husband.
objection.
is Miss Halliwell questioning the witness, or making a closing argument?
withdrawn. - I didn't kill my husband!
I loved my husband.
Bobby, I did not kill my husband!
you have to believe me.
I'm-I'm sorry, Libby.
it's not your fault, Bobby.
I want to ask you something, Angie.
I'd like you to adopt my son.
no, Lib, I can't do that. Not to you.
I've thought it through.
I barely survived my parents' house. I'm not gonna put him there.
money won't be a problem because there's the $2 million...
from the life insurance, and it's going into a trust fund in his name.
it isn't about money. - I know.
Matty loves you.
we can't let him become a ward of the state.
thank you.
Hey, kiddo.
come see me.
you're gonna go stay with Angie for a while. Okay, kiddo?
okay.
and you're gonna have lots of fun...
and I know you're gonna be a good boy, right?
Yes, Mommy.
and as soon as all this is over.
we'll be together again.
that's a promise, kiddo.
okay?
I love you.
I love you, too.
who's this? - Rich bitch from Whidbey Island.
she ain't gonna make it. - What do you think... a year?
five cartons says she offs herself inside of six months.
deal. - Get away from me.
Hey, take it easy. We're you new best friends.
heard you did your husband. Probably deserved it.
mine did.
I know what a pain it is to get here.
I taught him how to say the ABC's. - Is that true?
sing it, Matty. Go! - Yes.
did you learn the alphabet, sweetie?
Yeah. - Can you tell me?
give it up. Come on.
get off the phone, bitch. Jesus.
whoa, you're low on cigarettes.
if you want to make any friends,
I advise you buy another pack fast
on account of your personality,
it ain't the best I've ever seen.
hear you're tryin' to reach your friend, the one with your boy.
Yeah, I can't find 'em. They disappeared.
Oh, hon... If you could disappear that easy...
believe you me, I wouldn't be here right now.
me either.
think. Use your head.
there's gotta be a way to track 'em down.
small Frye School, front office. - Shh! Shh!
Hello, this is Angela Green calling.
Angie, it's Jennifer. - Yes, hi. How are you?
good to hear from you. - Yes, it's nice to hear your voice.
listen, I haven't gotten a severance check in a while...
and I was hoping I could verify with you.
that you have my correct mailing address and phone number.
I'll check. Can you hold on a sec? - Yes, of course. Thank you.
Yeah, I have it right here. Tell me if this is right.
3321 Mason Street, San Francisco...
94105
the phone number is 415...
Hello?
Angie? Angie.
Libby? I-I've tried to call you a thousand times.
is Matty okay? Where is he? - He's fine.
everything is fine.
what are you doing in San Francisco? Put him on the phone.
Hey, why are you acting this way? - Because you disappeared...
and I haven't seen my son in a month!
I-I was just about to call you. - Oh, bullshit!
how can you move and not tell me, Angie?
we were coming to see you next week.
just put Matty on the phone.
Matty? It's Mommy. Come say hi.
come here. Here.
Hi, Mommy. - Hello, sweetie pie.
how are you, Matty?
I think about you all the time, honey.
I miss you so much. Are you doing okay, kiddo?
I love you.
listen, Matty. I know that this has been really hard...
but Angie is gonna bring you up to see me next week, okay?
Yes, Mommy.
daddy! - Nick?
Nick?
he was in San Francisco last night.
I have a phone number, but it's already been disconnected.
no, I don't... I don't have a forwarding address.
he's gone. Well, don't you have investigators?
doesn't your company want to get its $2 million back?
why aren't you listening to me? I am innocent.
Yeah, you are. Sure, you are.
hurry up.
put some elbow grease behind that stirring.
nobody wants to eat any burnt tapioca.
does it smell like it's burning?
Oh, I swear you got shit for brains, girl.
you're in prison. Do you get that?
nobody wants to listen to anybody in prison,
so you can just forget about reopening your case...
or a jailhouse appeal.
you got that?
they take years... and they're 95% unsuccessful.
so, if you want my advice...
no. - Well, you're gonna get it.
you do your time. - So what are you now, a lawyer?
once upon a time.
but they tend to disbar murderers.
and here's your Christmas present. You ready?
pay attention, because this is best goddamn advice you ever gonna get.
ever hear of double jeopardy? Fifth amendment to the constitution?
huh? No? Well, double jeopardy provides that
"no person may be tried for the same crime twice. " You got that?
keep stirrin'. The state says you already killed your husband.
they can't convict you of it a second time.
that means that when you leave here,
you track him down, and when you find him you can kill him.
that's right. You can walk right up to him in Times Square,
put a gun to his head and pull the fuckin' trigger...
and there's nothin' anybody can do about it.
kinda makes you feel warm and tingly all over, don't it?
that's right. Keep stirrin'.
I gotta hand it to you, honey. It's just sheer hate driving you on.
the only way you're gonna look like that...
is if I staple the picture to your forehead.
just trust me, okay?
Matty's eighth birthday, honey. - Aw.
Oh... - Look at that.
you know, Evelyn, I read that even if a child
is separated from its mother the day it's born,
it never forgets her voice.
think that's true?
course I do.
I feel like I've grown these past six years.
Grown"? Honey, they don't want to hear
that you've turned into some kind of tree, okay?
so just repeat after me: "If I could trade places with my husband, I would.
Ugh. "If I could trade places with my husband, I would.
that's good. Now throw in a lot of that born-again-Jesus stuff.
they like that. - Listen, listen, listen.
I want you to start with this...
I'm not sitting in front of you today to make excuses.
I'm not sitting in front of you today to try to make any excuses.
I killed my husband.
I've had to live with that every day for the past six years.
but I swear to you that I'm a changed person.
why should we believe you?
I don't think I can ask you to believe me.
all I can really do is believe in myself,
and know that if I were given a chance, I could do something good with my life.
make up for the wrong I did.
that was cool. Oh, mom-my!
Yeah! - Hey, hey. Talk to me.
Oh, man, did you see that?
six years telling each other stories,
about all the shit that's been done to you.
a lot of shit's been done to you. I know that.
but let's imagine that all those people that did that shit showed up here.
the man's across the hall. - Thanks.
let's imagine that they all showed up here and apologized.
would that change the situation you're in right now?
there's the windup... - Come in.
I'm Elizabeth Parsons. - What do you have in that box?
Elizabeth Parsons.
the state of Washington has granted you a conditional parole.
for the next three years, you will observe all the rules of this facility, which means no fighting, no fornicating, no drinking, no drugs...
no exceptions, no excuses.
do you understand that? - Yes.
this is your social security card.
you will find gainful and sustained employment.
you are not to carry a firearm or a weapon of any kind...
especially a knife.
curfew is at 8: 30.
this is my cell phone number. Do not lose it.
if you think there's a chance you will be even five minutes late,
you will call me, I will have you picked up.
do you understand that? Good.
any violation of these conditions
and your "get out of jail free" card will be revoked by me and you will
return to prison to serve the remainder of your sentence and maybe then some.
look right here.
is this a problem for you? - No.
Yes, it is. Do you want to tell me about him?
no.
no.
I'm gonna have trouble with you, Parsons.
no, sir. No, you're not. I learned my lesson. I just...
I'm not interested in your goddamn contrition.
I'm interested in your behavior. Get out of here and behave yourself.
you're in room eight on the second floor.
no, you're, uh...
you're never gonna get anywhere like that.
here.
hmm. Nice shampoo.
what are you looking for? - A friend I haven't seen for years.
someone said I should try the Internet.
this a boy... friend?
girl. - Well, in that case, I'll help you.
does your friend have E-mail?
I have no idea. - Okay, come on. Let's do some surfing.
so, what's your friend's name? - Angela Green.
uh, zip code?
hmm. How about a social security number?
that way we could run a credit report, and it'll give us her address.
Nope. She was a school teacher.
done deal.
and... voil?
now, maybe when this thing has finished its searching, we could go to this...
this neat little bar I know and, uh, you know, have a little drink.
what do you say? - Yeah.
I just have to check in with my parole officer first.
you've been to jail? - Actually, prison. Jail is different.
so, what did you do, not pay your parking tickets?
Oh, no. I was convicted of murdering my husband.
you're kidding, right?
no, I'm not. Um, "sliced and diced," the paper called it.
can you believe that?
you're not kidding?
no. I said I wasn't. But it would be nice to have a drink.
I haven't been out in a long time.
ye... Oh!
Oh, look, I just remembered I have, um...
this appointment with the... - See ya.
see ya. Sorry.
Oh. Book. See ya.
Oh, my God.
he takes me out for dinner and feeds me escargot. Do you know what those are?
Yeah. - Snails. Snails, yuck.
but anyway, the moment I go to bed with him...
the big asshole dumps me. - Geez, man.
Oh, for Christ's sake, you nit-picking fuck!
ruby, do not insult me by raising your voice.
I'm standing right here, and I can hear you just fine.
all right. Sorry. - I don't like it when you call me names.
please, Mr. Lehman, don't do this to me. I didn't do nothing!
where were you this afternoon? - I was at my job.
you were on Pike Street wearing lime hot pants and fishnet stockings!
I was on my way to work! - At McDonald's? In those clothes?
you haven't been to work in a week! Get your stuff.
look, I-I'm sorry, man. I won't do it again.
I will never do that shit again. I promise that.
you blew off your parole. You're going back. It's that simple.
you fuck. You fuckin' cocksucker!
you got a dirty mouth, Ruby! - I want one chance!
I just want one chance!
goddamn you, motherfucker!
you son of a bitch. You mean fucker.
you send me back there it'll kill me, you mean son of a bitch!
come on. - Fuck you! Fucking asshole!
show's over. Go to sleep!
you think I'm a mean son of a bitch?
I think you could have given her a second chance.
there are no second chances in this house. This is the last chance house.
you try to understand that. -Yeah. Yeah, we got it.
what the hell is wrong with that guy?
what I heard, the man used to be some college whatchamacallit.
law teacher or something? - Yeah, that's right. That's right.
you're kidding. How does a law professor end up someplace like this?
cause life's a bitch. - Bitch, my ass.
he got a D. U.I. And totaled his car.
I heard he totaled his wife and his daughter in that accident.
girl, you're talkin' shit. Nobody got killed.
but by the time his wife got done with him, I bet he wished he was dead.
took everything he had. Including the kid.
hasn't seen his girl in years.
Libby, it's wrong of you to be here. It's very wrong.
I'm sorry to bother you, but you're my only hope.
Sharon? No, you put that down, please.
Libby, I'm sorry. I can't.
I want to find my son!
Matty's had six years with Angie.
I mean, think about it, Libby... six years.
Oh, Benjamin, that's a great sand castle.
if you come back into his life right now...
it's just gonna cause more disruption and pain.
just think about it, Libby, please? Think about it.
I just want to see him, Rebecca.
can you give me an address for Angie, so I can see him?
look, I'm sorry. I really am sorry.
Lauren? Come on, get down, please. That's it.
Where's Parsons? - I don't know. Not here.
probably just a raccoon.
check up the stairs.
cutter! Up here!
shit!
I got her.
there she is.
shit!
Ohh!
Jesus Christ, Libby, what are you doing here?
did you have a nice day at the beach?
you piss me off, Parsons.
angela Green... that's the woman that's got your kid, right?
can we not talk, please, Lehman?
okay. All right.
so why'd she skip town? - She just skipped town.
Yeah, with your husband, who isn't dead...
cause you didn't kill him?
bullshit. - Okay, I killed my husband.
I chopped him up into little bits, and dumped him in the Pacific.
are you satisfied? - No. No.
you were a hell of a lot closer to your kid three days ago than you are today.
all you had to do was wait three years. That's all.
you fucking idiot.
you cannot know what it is like to sit in prison for six years
and think of nothing else in the world but your son.
did I make the right choice? You ask the wrong question, Lehman.
I didn't have a choice. Fuck your curfew!
who's that? Your daughter?
is that a problem for you, Lehman?
I'm going up top.
don't go anywhere.
Janey, honey, read your book.
Oh! Shit!
Oh, my God!
I got him! - Grab ahold for me.
o-2 ready.
is he all right? - I guess he's all right.
did you voluntarily give her the gun?
come on, Karl. What do you think? Hey! Hey.
sorry. -Were you drinking?
no, I wasn't drinking. - It's been known to happen.
do you have any idea where she's gone? - No.
all right. Well, that's about all, then, isn't it?
all what?
there'll be an investigation into your actions today.
I wouldn't hold my breath about the prospect of keeping your job.
Karl, give me a break. Goddamn.
thanks a lot.
sent your father off to the V. F.W.
he'll be playing gin for hours.
some things never change. - Oh!
he's not as bad as he used to be, you know.
I'm glad for you, Mama.
I always said there was good money in tomatoes.
so. You're in the market for a B. M.W?
Yeah. Who isn't? - Well, they're the best.
I decided it was finally time to trade up.
right.
so why don't you check my credit and see if I can finance this.
great. Let me have your social security number...
and I'll get the ball rolling.
twenty Oriole Terrace, Evergreen, Colorado.
is that your current address?
twenty Oriole Terrace, Evergreen, Colorado? Sure is.
didn't you say your name was Angela Green? 'Cause this says Ryder.
Oh, no. I said Ryder. Angela Ryder. - What about the car?
here. Fill this out and come back to me.
how's tricks, Orbe? - No way.
no way, no way. I've been clean, Mr. Travis.
Oh, I know. I believe you. I do.
what I need is a search on a lady named Angela Green.
I've got her social security number here. I'd like you to...
please. You know I'm not allowed to give out personal information.
Oh, I'm so... I shouldn't have asked you that. I'm sorry.
Uh-huh.
speaking of giving out personal information, does your employer know...
you used to perform the art of fellatio for a living...
went to prison, and you're on parole? - Okay. Okay. Shut up.
you're required by law to tell him. - All right. Okay.
you're looking good, Orbe.
I know.
honey, can you get that?
Hi.
who is it, Sam? - Uh, some lady.
may I help you?
I'm looking for my friend, Angela Ryder.
I thought this was her address. - I've never heard of her.
but we've just moved in. Maybe you should check with the woman next door.
she's been here 40 years.
excuse me.
dearie, whatever you're selling, I've already got two of them.
I'm just looking for my friend, Angela Ryder.
she used to live next door.
Oh, I... I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.
but Angie died in the accident.
I- It was three or four years ago.
it was one of those awful things. The...
the, uh, stove, the gas stove in their house was leaking.
the explosion knocked out some of my windows...
and, uh... - What about the boy?
Matty? He's such a dear child.
no, he and Simon weren't there when it happened.
poor Simon.
I've never seen anyone so... grief stricken.
Oh, I'm sure.
help me out, kiddo.
it would really help if you could remember...
what kind of car she was driving.
well, it was an old truck. - Yeah?
it's, um... I don't know what year or make or anything.
well, what color was it?
Kandinsky? It's a bit out of our reach, I'm afraid.
I have a few Picasso and Chagall lithographs.
mm, no. It-It's Kandinsky...
that I'm particularly interested in, especially his Blue Rider period.
I love that. - Uh, well, uh...
let's check Art Scan.
Kandinskys don't become available too often, I'm afraid.
here's a lovely little Miro.
it's quite reasonable. - It really needs to be Kandinsky.
Kandinsky... yes.
Ah! Here is a lovely 1922 Kandinsky lithograph.
it's not quite the... - The 1911 is all that interests me.
1911...
stop. There. Yes. Yes, that's it.
we've missed that. It was sold to a museum in Munich six months ago.
do you think you could find who sold it? Perhaps they have more.
well, uh, why, yes. Yes, let's see.
if you'll excuse me a moment.
Yes, sir. Can I help you?
Yes. My name is Travis Lehman.
actually, I'm looking for a young lady.
she seemed so refined.
I would really like to know what that woman wanted in your gallery.
can I help you?
I'm looking for Jonathan Devereaux.
Mr. Devereaux is out right now. He'll be back tonight for the party.
well, is Matty here? - I don't believe I know you, ma'am.
maybe you'd like to leave a message.
it's certainly a pleasure having you stay with us...
here at the Monteleone, Mrs. Kritch. - Thank you.
my suite has a view? - Your room has a lovely view.
and I need a masseuse. - I'll send Jerome right up.
Bruce?
fourteen twenty, Mrs. Kritch.
hello.
I'm sorry. Are you... lost?
no. Actually, I'm found. I just had an hour with Jerome.
Oh. Jerome. I've heard that he is marvelous.
he's fabulous. I haven't felt this good since my husband died.
so, I've got something for tonight, but I think I need Armani.
Yes. Very good, Mrs...
Kritch. Suite 1420.
of course.
I'll be charging it to my room.
hmm. Now, Mrs. Kritch,
I would say that you are a size four?
a two. - Of course.
there's a guy waiting for you.
did you catch that thing?
what did you use for bait?
I caught that big bucket-mouth son of a bitch...
off an old rebel lure my daddy left me.
course there's buzz bombs, poppers, jigs...
all kinds of things work back in these waters.
I'm Jim Mangold.
Travis Lehman, Washington Department of Corrections.
what can I do for you?
who's this? - That's somebody I'm looking for.
pretty girl. - Oh, yeah.
she's very pretty, for a convicted murderer.
she jumped parole on me.
Mr. Lehman, I'd love to be able to help you, sir.
no, I don't want you guys to go to any trouble. I can handle matters.
I just came down as a professional courtesy
since she's in New Orleans,
and came here to kill one of your prominent citizens.
how is she planning on doing that? - I don't know.
she'll probably use the. 38 special she stole from me.
Roy Lee!
get these in the works... now.
she looks lovely. - Invitation, please.
enjoy your evening.
good evening. Thank you.
invitations, please. Yes, I need to see your invitation.
enjoy your evening.
your invitation?
good evening. - What a remarkable wrap.
where on earth did you find that?
the first lady asked me the same thing when we stayed at the White House
and I wouldn't tell her either.
your invitation, sir? - I got it right here.
enjoy your evening. Good evening, miss. - Good evening.
good evening, mesdames and messieurs. - Good evening!
we're delighted to have you with us this evening
on this very special occasion. As is the custom in New Orleans, since before
the War of Northern Aggression.
we offer the ladies of this fair city our first bachelor
to be put up on the auction block, our host, Jonathan Devereaux.
where is that man? Where is that man?
Hey, Jonathan. - Thank you, Louis.
you all having a good time?
now then, ladies, what you see before you,
is a moderately presentable man in his 30s,
given to unhealthy thoughts and a dissipated lifestyle.
with... and this is what's gonna cost you the really big money.
absolutely no redeeming moral virtue.
five hundred. - Dear woman, my cuff links cost more.
do I hear a thousand?
a thousand. - Thank you.
Mmm! - Two thousand.
all right, now, did I just hear the voice of the charming Miss Monroe?
cause I was just starting to worry... beginning to think you didn't care.
twenty-five hundred.
twenty-five hundred. We have a new bidder.
twenty-five hundred. - Three thousand.
five thousand. - Oh!
fifty-five hundred.
we have fifty-five hundred. Will, uh...
will the lady take us to six?
ten thousand dollars.
well, see, at last, someone who knows my true value.
now, Miss Monroe, I believe the bid
is to you at $10, 500.
well, you can have him, honey.
believe me, he ain't worth that much.
I know from personal experience.
Yeah. Thank you, honey.
all right, going once.
going twice.
sold to the woman in the back.
ten thousand dollars.
would you like to come forward and claim your prize, young lady?
Hello, Nick.
well, aren't you gonna give me a kiss?
I think I've earned it.
and now... - I'll make this real easy for you, Nick.
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse.
you used to love a good deal, didn't you?
can we take this someplace private? - I don't think so.
I remember what happened the last time we were alone.
I don't believe we've met. I'm Suzanne Monroe.
I'm Libby. I'm his wife.
well, Jonathan!
a minute ago a bachelor, and now you're married.
you don't waste any time.
you been in New Orleans long? - She's, uh...
I'm just passing through town to pick up my child.
I'll be leaving very soon. - How nice.
we're finally putting the past behind us and moving on...
with our lives, aren't we, Jonathan? - Sure.
I do have one question, though.
how long were Angie and you fucking before you decided to get rid of me?
would you excuse us, please? - Oh, yeah, sure. Go ahead.
where is he, Nick? - Libby. Libby...
you destroyed my life, and I will destroy yours...
unless you give me Matty.
that's all I want. - Let me explain something to you.
you have to understand something. We were going under.
we were gonna lose everything.
if I'd had any guts, I would have killed myself...
but I was trying to protect you.
that's why I got the life insurance... I would be out of the picture...
and you and Matty would be okay.
and I-I just never believed they would convict you.
they did, Nick.
and the thing with Angie happened later.
it was just... It was a nightmare.
and the worst part of it was being away from you.
so is that why you killed her?
that was an accident. - Nice try, Nick. I'm not buying.
it's bullshit. - I will swear on the life of our son.
Oh, don't you fucking dare.
you can keep your hotel, your fancy accent and your new name.
just give me Matty. - I understand.
no. Now. Give him to me now.
Libby, it's the middle of the night. I can't just walk away.
do you think I'm stupid? - No, I don't think you're stupid.
I won't let you slip away once again. - It's too far to Matty's school.
you've got to be patient. - I've been patient for six years.
do I hear 2, 000? - I want my child.
Ah! Thank you. You're a beautiful woman.
I'll call you tomorrow, Nick. No screwing around.
going twice. Okay, 2, 000 for the lady in red.
excuse me. Do you know where Mr. Devereaux is?
he's at the bar, sir. - Over here?
Yes, sir. - Thank you.
you ready to spend some more money? Who's gonna start us off?
I'm sorry. Oh, thank you, Marcel.
can I offer you a drink? - Oh, no thanks.
wait a second. Let me guess.
I take you for scotch and soda.
well, I'll have a Diet Coke, please.
well, all right, but I bet you used to drink and now you're on the wagon.
ten dollars says I'm right. - You've never seen this woman before?
no, I'm positive. - Okay.
let me get it straight. She believes that I am her husband...
Oh, yeah. - Whom she killed.
Yes, sir.
that's-that's pretty far-fetched.
far-fetched or not, she is in New Orleans...
she does have a gun and she is looking for you.
thank you. I'll alert our security. - You do that.
cops have been passing these out.
no reward. Screw 'em.
you're gonna be posted in every hotel in town.
so much for a good night's sleep.
take this. Get out of here.
thanks a lot.
let's go, Lehman. We spotted your girl.
Where'd she go, Dilbert?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! - I'm sorry.
what do you think you're doing? - I'm very sorry, ma'am.
I thought you were somebody else. It was a case of mistaken identity.
have a good evening. - I take it that ain't her.
Mr. Lehman.
come in.
thank you. - May I offer you a Cuban cigar?
Oh, no thanks.
as you can see, I'm alive and kicking.
Yeah.
so what can I do for you this morning?
we spotted the Parsons woman in the Quarter last night.
she got away. I just came by to find out if you'd heard from her.
not a peep. - Do you have any idea
why she's fixated her lunacy on you?
well, the world's full of crazy people, am I right?
Oh, yes, you are right.
truer words were never spoken.
those are nice pictures there.
did your kids do them?
uh, no.
those pictures are by a very great artist named Kandinsky.
Oh. - Why do I think you already knew that?
excuse me for a second.
yes?
this is a business call. - Oh, I'm sorry.
I hope you'll excuse me. You let yourself out that back door.
it leads to the kitchen. Get the chef to fix you a New Orleans breakfast.
Thanks. - I recommend the Eggs St. Jacques.
Oh, boy. That sounds good. - Mm-hmm. I have your card.
okay.
morning, darlin'. I hope you had a nice night.
I want you to bring Matty to Lafayette Cemetery number three.
a cemetery? That's an odd choice for a reunion.
it's a big tourist place, Nick. Lot of people around.
you're a smart girl. I can have him there by 4: 00.
Where's Matty? - Relax. He's... He was nervous.
so I just told him he could go play inside.
there he is.
Matty? Come over here, son.
Oh, geez. Matty...
okay, I'll get him for you. - No! No.
that's something I want to do.
Matty?
Matty?
Hey, kiddo.
Hey, Matty!
Matty?
m- Matty, it's Mommy.
Mr. Lehman, you're gonna have to learn to relax, son.
what have you got your panties in such a twist about, anyhow?
you ever arrest anybody
you thought was innocent, Mangold? - Nope.
course there's no information on Jonathan Devereaux,
that's over three years old.
three years ago the guy didn't exist. - So he changed his name.
lots of folks change their names, Lehman.
that don't make 'em criminals. - Yeah, but I'm betting
he changed it from Simon Ryder, and before that, Nick Parsons.
but you can't prove it. - No.
Hey! Is that long distance?
bill me.
Lucy, hi. This is Travis. Listen.
I want you to get the D. M.V. To fax me a Washington driver's license
photograph of one Nicholas Parsons.
I'm at the New Orleans Police Department.
you better talk to Mr. Carruthers. - Travis!
his colon is twisted in a knot. - Give me that.
I've had to cover your office for you, Travis.
where the hell are you? - Listen to me, Karl.
I think maybe this Parsons woman has been telling the truth.
you're not a law professor anymore, Travis.
you're barely even a parole officer.
so stop playing Mission Impossible... - All I need...
is a D. M.V. Driver's license photograph of Nicholas Parsons.
you get back here today.
because tomorrow, you're going in front of the Commission.
Karl, I know I'm right.
you give me a chance, okay?
now, I'm asking you politely.
you send me the goddamn picture!
Hey!
Hey!
it's not him.
see, Lehman, the thing is, every now and again,
we all want to believe in something,
but we just keep forgetting that 99. 9 percent of the time.
life just flat don't work out.
I hadn't thought of that, Mangold.
Thanks. I feel a lot better now. -Any time, Hoss. Any time.
hold it. Hold it right here.
it's over, Libby.
Oh, Travis.
messages.
thank you.
Mr. Devereaux? -Mr. Lehman.
I'm sorry. This is really not a good time.
I understand.
a lot of people feel that way about me. But I have good news.
Mm-hmm? -Won't take long.
well? -Well...
turns out I owe you an apology, Mr. Devereaux.
after our last conversation I started thinking
maybe that Parsons woman is telling the truth about who you used to be.
so I asked the Washington State Department of Motor Vehicles
to send me a driver's license photograph of Nicholas Parsons.
And? - And this is what came up.
well...
we all make mistakes. There's no harm done.
then I thought about it some more, and it occurred to me what a common name...
nicholas Parsons is.
you know, it turns out there were six.
and this...
was number three.
I never liked that picture.
so, Mr. Lehman, you came here to make a deal...
otherwise, I guess you would have gone straight to the police.
so, question is, what's your price? - A million dollars.
it's a nice round figure, right?
uh...
all right. But you're gonna have to give me a couple of days.
no way. One million dollars, right now.
Mr. Lehman, it's 9: 00 at night. I can't just...
wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait.
I have $100, 000 in the safe here.
and you can have that now.
I'll get you the rest tomorrow.
you got a deal.
we do have one other problem, and that's Mrs. Parsons.
she could still make a lot of trouble for us, even from prison...
and I really don't need that. - I think I've solved that problem.
what do you mean? - Let's say the problem has been buried.
Really? - She's gone, I promise you.
you're not very good at keeping promises, Nick.
you gonna do something?
what are you talking to me for? She's the one with the gun.
they're tough in Louisiana, Libby.
you shoot me, they'll give you the gas chamber.
no, they won't.
it's called double jeopardy. I learned a few things in prison, Nick.
I could shoot you in the middle of Mardi Gras and they can't touch me.
as an ex-law professor, I can assure you she is right.
Where's my son?
in St. Albans School in Georgia, all right?
you have your son back. You got what you want.
I haven't felt that good in six years.
I don't want to kill you, Nick.
I just want you to suffer like I suffered.
what she means, Nick, is, you're going to prison...
for murder.
who did I supposedly murder? - Me.
all you've got is an old fax photo. - Which supplies the motive.
your wife, whom you had framed, tracks you down...
and to keep her from exposing you, you kill her.
you won't get away with it.
well, I think I've solved that problem.
what do you mean? - Let's say the problem has been buried.
Really? - She's gone, I promise you.
taped confessions are very persuasive in court, Nick...
and of course there is...
the physical evidence that we're gonna put in the trunk of your car.
a shovel, hair, my fingerprints, a little blood.
don't forget the gasoline. - It'll look like you burned...
and buried my body just like you say on the tape.
the prosecution rests. You better get out of here.
nobody wants a dead woman walking around when the police...
are trying to arrest a guy for her murder.
wait a minute. I'll take that gun.
well, Lehman, you gonna live?
I doubt it.
ms. Parsons, since you are still legally his wife...
I expect you just inherited yourself a right fine little hotel here.
not interested.
I guess I'm gonna take off now.
no. No, you're not. You're a parole violator. You're in my c-custody.
you're going with me to Seattle...
where I will demand a full pardon and a parade...
and a little pink poodle...
on a key chain.
come on, Ryan, pass it!
what are you waiting for? Go on.
I don't know if I've ever been so scared in my whole life.
I think a big part of me never thought I'd really find him.
what if he doesn't recognize me?
I mean, maybe after all this time... - Damn, woman!
because of you, I have lost a perfectly good used car, and a not-so-good job.
if you don't go to this kid right now...
I'm gonna have you arrested for stupidity.
go on.
Thanks, Lehman.
you saved my life.
you saved mine too.
coach Matthews. How you doing? - Nice to meet you.
it'll be halftime soon.
halftime!
Matty.
Matty.
Hi.
do you know who I am?
they told me you were dead.
no, sweetheart.
they said it would, which isn't quite the same thing.
hello.
I could have posted that for you.
well, I prefer to do it myself.
I'll wait outside.
what are you doing?
if you must know,
I'm trying to find some space on top of the cupboard, to make life easier.
so what's in it, then? What?
the bleedin' great packing case that weighs a ton, that's what.
can you just leave it?
no I can't and you'll tell me right now.
anything interesting? Not particularly.
it's from Evelyn Napier.
you met him with the Delderfields last November at Doncaster Races.
is that Lord Branksome's boy? It is.
do you like him?
I don't dislike him.
and what's he writing about? Nothing much.
he's out with the York and Ainsty next week.
the meet is at Downton. He wants some tea when he's up here.
Where's he staying? With friends?
he says he's found a pub that caters for hunting.
well, we can improve on that.
he must come here. He can send the horses up early, if he wants.
he'll know why you're asking him.
I can't think what you mean. His mother's a friend of mine.
she'll be pleased at the idea.
not very pleased
she's dead.
all the more reason, then.
you can write a note too and put it in with mine.
should I tell him about your friendship with his late mother?
I'm sure you of all people can compose a letter to a young man without any help from me.
how much did it cost? Every penny I'd saved.
or, almost.
And...is this the mystery lover?
I've been taking a correspondence course in typing and shorthand.
that's what was in the envelopes.
are you any good?
Yes.
I am, actually.
her Ladyship wants the fawn skirt Lady Mary never wears.
her seamstress is going to fit it to Lady Sybil, but I can't find it.
I'll come in a minute.
they're waiting now. One minute.
I'm just changing my cap and apron.
have you told anyone?
what did your parents say?
well, I can't tell them till I've got a job.
dad will think I'm a fool to leave a good place, and Mum will say I'm getting above myself, but...
but I don't believe that.
nor do I.
it's not of my doing.
it's all Mary's own work, but I think we should encourage it.
Branksome's a dull dog, but I don't suppose that matters.
did you know his wife had died?
he only ever talks about racing.
Cora is right.
Mary won't take Matthew Crawley, so we'd better get her settled, before the bloom is quite gone off the rose.
is the family an old one?
older than yours, I imagine.
old enough. And there's plenty of money.
Really?
mama, you've already looked him up in the stud books and made enquiries about the fortune, don't pretend otherwise.
are you afraid someone will think you're American if you speak openly?
I doubt it'll come to that.
shall I ring for tea? No, not for me.
I'm meeting Cripps at five.
I'll see you at dinner.
you don't seem very pleased.
I'm pleased.
it's not brilliant, but I'm pleased.
so...?
I don't want Robert to use a marriage as an excuse to stop fighting for Mary's inheritance.
it won't make any difference.
I don't think he has the slightest intention of fighting as it is.
the price of saving Downton is to accept Matthew Crawley as his heir.
what about you?
I don't dislike Matthew in fact, I rather admire him.
is that sufficient reason to give him your money?
of course not. Then there's nothing more to be said.
are we going to have tea or not?
hello.
I'd offer you a lift, if I could.
it was you I was coming to see.
then, your timing is matchless. I've just got off the train.
the other day at dinner, cousin Isobel was saying you wanted to see some of the local churches.
she's right, I do.
I want to know more about the county generally if I'm to live here.
well, I thought I might show you a few of the nearer ones.
we could take a picnic and make an outing of it.
that's very kind. Nonsense, I'll enjoy it.
it's too long since I played the tourist.
well, it would have to be a Saturday.
churches work on Sunday and I work all the weekdays.
then, Saturday it is.
I'll get Lynch to sort out the governess cart and I'll pick you up at about 11.
how does it work? It's easy.
you just press the letters and they print on the paper.
get back, please.
they were trying to hide it, so I knew it was wrong.
Where's Gwen now?
doing the dining room with Anna. They'll be finished soon.
then I'll wait.
with all due respect, Mr Carson, Gwen is under my jurisdiction.
indeed she is, Mrs Hughes, and I have no intention of usurping your authority.
I merely want to get to the bottom of it.
why shouldn't Gwen have a typewriter?
mind your own business.
what's that doing here?
Ah, Gwen, come in.
why is that down here? Who's been in my room? They had no right.
see here, in the first place, none of the rooms in this house belong to u.
and, in the second, I am in charge of your welfare, and that gives me every right. This is you, isn't it?
all we want is to know what Gwen wants with a typewriter and why she feels the need to keep it secret.
she wants to keep it private, not secret.
there's a difference. Amen.
I've done nothing to be ashamed of.
I've bought a typewriter and taken a postal course in shorthand.
I'm not aware that either of these actions is illegal.
will you tell us why? Preferably without any more cheek.
because I want to leave service.
I want to be a secretary.
you want to leave service?
what's wrong with being in service? Nothing's wrong with it and there's nothing wrong with mending roads neither, but it's not what I want to do.
I should remind you that there are plenty of young girls who would be glad of a position in this house.
when I hand in my notice,
I shall be happy to think one of them will be taking my place.
what makes you think we'll wait till then?
are you hiring and sacking now, Miss O'Brien?
I thought that lay with Mr Carson and Mrs Hughes.
enough of this. I'm going to ring the dressing gong and we'll have no more talk of this tonight.
can I have my machine back now?
very well, but I wish I was sure you know what you're doing.
Daisy, what's happened to you?
I said you could go for a drink of water, not a trip up the Nile.
which churches will you show him?
I can't decide.
Kirby, possibly, or perhaps Easingwold.
you don't think you're being a bit obvious?
coming from you, that's rich.
there was a letter from Mr Napier in the evening post.
Oh, did he accept? Not yet.
perhaps he thought it was too obvious.
apparently he's bringing a friend with him, an attache at the Turkish Embassy.
a Mr Kemal Pamuk.
he's the son of one of the sultan's ministers and he's here for the Albanian talks.
what's that? To create an independent Albania.
don't you read the papers? I'm too busy living a life.
since Turkey's signature is vital, Mr Napier's been given the job of keeping him happy until the conference begins.
he's eager to try an English hunt.
I shall invite this Mr Pamuk to stay here as well.
who knows? A little hospitality in an English house may make all the difference to the outcome.
and, Mary, you will ride out with him.
Oh, Mama, must I?
my boots are at the menders and I haven't ridden for weeks.
Anna, please see that Lady Mary is fully equipped to go hunting.
Yes, Your Ladyship.
yes?
I saw this advertisement for a limp corrector.
yes?
what does it do, exactly?
it corrects limps.
does it work?
well, as I make it and I advertise it, is it likely I'd say no?
could I see one?
here we are.
you adjust this to the right height, to minimise the limp.
you tighten these, gradually, as tight as you can stand.
as the leg straightens, the foot lowers to the floor.
can't say it's gonna be easy and you can't slack.
every day, all day, if you mean business.
all right.
how much?
she asks if we can both dine on Saturday.
there are two young men staying, so you won't be so outnumbered for once.
what men?
a Turkish diplomat called... something I can't read and Lord Branksome's charming son, who's to be flung at Mary, presumably.
when it comes to cousin Mary, she's quite capable of doing her own flinging, I assure you.
open the door, can you?
I couldn't find her britches anywhere, so I asked Mr Bates.
he looked among His Lordship's riding clothes.
there they were.
I only hope to God I've got everything.
hat, I'll do here.
gloves and crop are in the hall.
Gwen?
whatever's the matter?
Hey, come on. Sit down.
what's up?
I'm just being silly.
you should get that brushed.
he won't be up for another half an hour, now what is it?
I suppose I've just realised that it's not going to happen.
what isn't? Well, none of it.
I'm not going to be a secretary.
I'm not going to leave service.
I doubt I'll leave here before I'm 60.
Hey, what's all this?
you saw their faces.
and they're right.
Oh, look at me.
I'm the daughter of a farmhand.
I'm lucky to be a maid.
I was born with nothing and I'll die with nothing.
don't talk like that.
you can change your life if you want to.
sometimes, you have to be hard on yourself, but you can change it completely, I know.
mr Bates, are you all right?
take her upstairs.
dry her off.
come on, Gwen.
Hey.
mr Bates, what's the matter?
nothing. Not a thing. I'm fine.
let me help you.
I'm perfectly all right, thank you, Mrs Hughes.
are you sure?
you're as white as a sheet.
it's my wonderful complexion, inherited from my Irish mother.
take it. Take it. Don't dawdle.
his Lordship... William...
sir.
Ah, very good.
can you see them, milady? Not yet.
Oh, wait a minute. Here's Mr Napier.
I was beginning to give up on you. We're moving off.
we were fools not to accept your mother's invitation and send the horses down early.
my groom only got here an hour or two ago, my mount's as jumpy as a deb at her first ball.
what about Mr Pamuk?
I gather, if he takes a tumble, you'll be endangering world peace.
don't worry about Kemal, he knows what he's doing on a horse.
well, where is he? Fussing.
he's rather a dandy.
I can see him now, a funny little foreigner, with a wide, cheeky grin and hair reeking of pomade.
I wouldn't quite say that.
here he is now.
lady Mary Crawley, I presume.
you presume right.
sorry to be so dishevelled.
we've been on a train since dawn and we had to change in a shed.
you don't look dishevelled to me.
lynch, you don't have to stay with me.
but His Lordship asked me to.
it's a waste of your day.
help Mr Napier's man get their things back to the house.
his Lordship said.
don't worry, I'll look after her.
we'll make it our business to keep her from harm, I promise.
I hope the day is living up to your expectations.
it's exceeding them in every way.
and where's Mr Napier?
he's gone over the bridge, look.
and what about you? Will you follow him?
or will you come over the jump with me?
I was never much one for going round by the road.
stay by me and we'll take it together.
I wish we could talk a little more about you.
what was it like?
growing up in Manchester?
does it say anything about the side aisles?
the side aisles were added in the 14th century by...Bishop Richard De Warren.
Yes, you can see that in the treatment of the stone.
it's wonderful to think of all those men and women worshipping together through the centuries, isn't it?
dreaming and hoping...
much as we do, I suppose.
was the screen a Cromwell casualty?
I daresay.
I wonder how Mary's getting on.
all right, I should think.
Why? Oh, I just wondered.
will she stay with the hunt the whole day?
Oh, you know Mary.
she likes to be in at the kill.
where shall we go next?
not home? Not yet.
we've time for one more, at least, before we lose the light.
I underestimated your enthusiasm.
come on.
is that one mine?
home is the hunter, home from the hill.
heavens, you have been in the wars.
Papa, this is Mr Pamuk.
my father, Lord Grantham.
how do you do, milord?
did you have a good day? Couldn't have been better.
this is Thomas, sir. He'll be looking after you.
you remember Mr Napier.
of course. How are you?
so kind of you to have us, Lady Grantham.
and this is Mr Pamuk.
how do you do? Milady.
well, what would you like?
just baths, we're worn out.
your cases are upstairs, sir.
if you'd like to follow me... Yes.
well, I hope Mary hasn't left you too exhausted, Mr Napier.
no.
he doesn't look Turkish at all.
he doesn't look like any Englishman I've ever met. Worse luck.
I think he's beautiful.
is there some crisis, of which I am unaware?
no, Mr Carson.
I cannot think of another reason why you should congregate here.
no, Mr Carson.
have you seen our visitor? Quite a treat for the ladies.
indeed, milord.
are they settled in all right?
I believe so. Mr Napier's valet seems competent and Thomas knows what he's doing.
why doesn't the gorgeous Turk have his own chap?
apparently his man speaks no English, so Mr Pamuk decided to leave him in London.
probably very wise. I hope Thomas doesn't mind.
you know Thomas, milord. He has to have a grumble, but he cheered up when he saw the gentleman.
Bates, is anything wrong? Nothing at all, milord.
is that strap too tight?
shall I adjust it, sir?
now, I'm relying on you to see that I go downstairs properly dressed.
don't worry, sir. I've got sharp eyes for anything out of order.
then I put yourself entirely in your hands.
you do right, sir.
I should love to visit Turkey.
Yes, it's a wonderful country.
my man always does this. Can you...?
I'm very...attracted to the Turkish culture.
then I hope your chance will come to sample it.
I hope so too.
you forget yourself.
I-I'm sorry, sir, I...
that will teach you to believe what the English say about foreigners.
I ought to report you.
I think you must ha- I mistook nothing.
but I will make you an offer.
later tonight, I may need some help with the geography of the house.
the geography? Yes.
I'm not sure yet, but I may wish to pay someone a visit.
if that is the case, you will help me.
and I will say nothing of your behaviour.
I don't understand. Why would she want to be a secretary?
she wants a different life.
but why?
I should far prefer to be a maid in a large and pleasant house than work from dawn till dusk in a cramped and gloomy office.
don't you agree, Carson? I do, milady.
why are we talking about this? What does it matter?
it matters that the people that live and work here are content.
of course. We should be helping Gwen, if that's what she wants.
I agree. Surely we must all encourage those less fortunate to improve their lot where they can.
not if it isn't in their best interests.
isn't the maid a better judge of that than we are?
what do you say, Mr Pamuk?
should our housemaid be kept enslaved, or forced out into the world?
why are you English so curious about other people's lives?
if she wishes to leave, and the law permits it, then let her go.
perhaps the law should not permit it, for the common good.
so you hanker for the days of serfdom.
I hanker...
for a simpler world.
is that a crime?
I do dream of a simpler world, as long as we can keep our trains and our dentistry.
I wish I shared your enthusiasm.
our dentist is horrid.
why go to him, then?
he treated all of us when we were children.
you know how the English are about these things.
success at the Grand National.
Yes, indeed, second.
well, the next time you feel a twinge, you must come to Istanbul.
wouldn't the journey be painful?
sometimes we must endure a little pain in order to achieve satisfaction.
lady Mary rode very well today.
why did you send Lynch back?
I had my champions to left and right. It was enough.
did you enjoy the hunt today, Mr Napier?
Mary said you had a tremendous run.
it was like something out of a Trollope novel.
and what about you, Mr Pamuk? Was your day successful?
Oh, yes, Lady Grantham. I can hardly remember a better one.
Mary has more suitors tonight than the Princess Aurora.
but will she judge them sensibly?
no-one's sensible at her age, nor should they be. That's our role.
well, if you'll excuse me... Thank you.
is it fun to be back in the saddle?
Yes, although I'll pay for it tomorrow.
would you ever come out with me?
or aren't we friends enough for that?
Oh, I think it might be.
that run reminded me of a day last month, up in Cheshire.
we came down the side of a hill - Excuse me.
it seems we must brush up on our powers of fascination.
I was a fool to bring him here.
don't you like him?
well, I like him very much, but so does everyone else, unfortunately.
excuse me.
I hope I didn't wear you out, today.
not at all. I enjoyed it.
we must do it again.
next time, let's take my mother.
she was so jealous, she made me promise she could come with us.
of course. How nice that would be.
what is it?
is this picture really a Della Francesca?
I think so. The second Earl brought back several paintings from...
mr Pamuk.
let me come to you tonight, please.
I can't think what I have said...that has led you to believe
I don't know when we'll meet again, so let it be tonight.
mr Pamuk...I will not repeat your words to my father, since I should hate to see you cast out into the darkness, but can we agree to consider them unsaid?
now, if you'll excuse me, I shall rejoin my mother and sisters.
you must be mad.
I am. I am in the grip of madness.
please leave at once, or I'll...
or you'll what?
I'll scream.
no you won't.
well, I'll ring the bell, then.
and who's on duty now? The hall boy?
will you let him really find a man in your bedroom?
what a story.
do you have any idea what you're asking?
I'd be ruined if they even knew we'd had this conversation, let alone if - What?
don't worry, you'll still be a virgin for your husband.
heavens, is this a proposal?
alas, no, I don't think our union would please your family.
I'm afraid not.
nor mine.
but...
a little imagination...
you wouldn't be the first.
you and my parents have something in common.
Oh?
you believe I'm much more of a rebel than I am.
now, please go.
I'm not what you think I am.
if it's my mistake, if I've led you on, I'm sorry, but...I'm not.
you are just what I think you are.
no.
I've never done anything.
of course not.
one look at you would tell me that.
Oh, my darling.
won't it hurt?
is it safe?
trust me.
he's dead. I think he's dead.
no, I'm sure he's dead.
but how?
we were together and...
he's dead.
in your room?
we've got to get him back to his own bed. But how?
it's in the Bachelor's Corridor, miles from my room.
could we manage it between us?
he weighs a ton. I could hardly shift him at all.
we'll need at least one other. What about Bates?
he couldn't lift him.
william can't keep a secret.
and Thomas wouldn't try to.
we've got to do something.
who else has as much to lose as you if it ever gets out?
not Papa.
please don't say Papa. I couldn't bear the way he'd look at me.
no, not His Lordship.
what happened? I don't know.
a heart attack, I suppose, or a stroke or...
he was alive and suddenly, he cried out, and then he was dead.
but why was he here at all?
did he force himself on you?
well...we can talk about that later.
Now...we must decide what to do for the best.
there's only one thing we can do.
I couldn't. It's not possible.
if you don't, we will figure in a scandal of such magnitude, it will never be forgotten until long after we're both dead.
I'll be ruined, Mama. Ruined and notorious.
a laughing stock, a social pariah.
is that what you want for your eldest daughter?
is it what you want for the family?
we must cover him up.
I can't make his eyes stay shut.
leave that and come away.
he was so beautiful.
her Ladyship's right.
we must get back to our rooms.
I feel that I can never forgive what you have put me through this night.
I hope, in time, I will come to be more merciful, but I doubt it.
you won't tell Papa?
since it would probably kill him and certainly ruin his life,
I will not, but I keep the secret for his sake, not for yours.
Yes, Mama.
Anna.
I will not insult you by asking that you also conceal Lady Mary's shame.
let us go.
I imagine you've heard what's happened?
Yes.
a terrible thing.
awful.
ghastly for your parents.
I don't suppose I shall ever make it up to them.
well, it wasn't your fault.
I brought him here.
if it isn't my fault, whose is it?
I was wondering if you might show me the gardens before I go.
we could get some fresh air.
I won't, if you'll forgive me.
I ought to stay and help Mama.
of course.
I'm so sorry about all this.
I told your father I'll deal with the Embassy.
they won't be any more annoyance for you.
thank you.
actually, he was a terribly nice fellow.
I wish you could have known him better.
I took him on as a duty, but I liked him more and more the longer I knew him.
perhaps you saw his qualities for yourself.
which obviously...
...you did.
I had an uncle who went like that. Finished his cocoa, closed his book and fell back dead on the pillow.
I don't think Mr Pamuk bothered with cocoa much, or books.
he had other interests.
I meant you can go just like that, with no reason.
that's why you should treat every day as if it were your last
well, we couldn't criticise Mr Pamuk where that's concerned.
what do you mean? Nothing.
careful with that.
Gwen, are you busy? Your Ladyship?
I saw this. It came out yesterday. Look.
it's for a secretary at a new firm in Thirsk.
see?
what, I don't understand. How did you know?
that you wanted to leave? Carson told my father.
and you don't mind? Why should I?
I think it's terrific that people make their own lives, especially women.
write to them today and name me as your reference.
I can give it without ever specifying precisely what your work here has been.
milady?
thank you.
lady Grantham.
I've come to say goodbye.
they're bringing the car round, to take me to the station.
have you said goodbye to Mary?
I have.
will we be seeing you here again?
nothing would give me more pleasure, but I'm a little busy at the moment.
I wonder if I might risk embarrassing you?
because I should like to make myself clear.
the truth is, Lady Grantham, I am not a vain man.
I do not consider myself a very interesting person.
but I feel it's important that my future wife should think me so.
a woman who finds me boring could never love me, and I believe marriage should be based on love.
at least, at the start.
thank you for your faith in me, Mr Napier.
your instincts do you credit.
good luck to you.
did Mr Napier get off all right?
he did, milord.
and poor Mr Pamuk has been taken care of?
we got Grassbys from Thirsk in the end.
they're very good and they didn't mind coming out on a Sunday.
is everyone all right downstairs?
well, you know...
he was a handsome stranger from foreign parts one minute, the next, he was as dead as a doornail.
it's bound to be a shock.
of course, upstairs or down.
it's been horrid for the ladies, and for the female staff, I expect.
it's particularly hard on the younger maids.
indeed.
don't let the footmen be too coarse in front of them.
thomas likes to show off, but we must have a care for feminine sensibilities
they are finer and more fragile than our own.
mr Bates?
I am going to have to insist that you tell me what is the matter.
I thought it was for Mr Carson to give me orders.
mr Carson's no better than any other man when it comes to illness.
now tell me what it is and I'll see what I can do.
it's nothing, truly.
I've twisted my bad leg and walked on it too soon.
it'll be fine in a day or two.
well, if it isn't, I'm sending for the doctor.
the Dowager Countess.
Oh, my dears.
is it really true?
I can't believe it.
last night, he looked so well.
of course, it would happen to a foreigner. It's typical.
don't be ridiculous.
I'm not being ridiculous.
no Englishman would dream of dying in someone else's house.
especially someone they didn't even know.
Oh, Granny, even the English aren't in control of everything.
I hope we're in control of something, if only ourselves.
but we're not. Don't you see that?
we're not in control of anything at all.
Edith, go and tell Mary to come back at once and apologise to her grandmother.
no, leave her alone.
she's had a shock. We all have.
just let her rest.
Oh, just the ticket.
nanny always said sweet tea was the thing for frayed nerves.
though why it has to be sweet, I couldn't tell you.
what did you mean,
mr Pamuk lived each day as if it were his last?
what I said.
well, how did you know?
can't keep William waiting. Gangway.
I'll be asking the same question later, so you'd better have an answer ready.
Daisy, where have you hidden the flour? I can't see it anywhere.
it's just there, Mrs Patmore.
well, fetch it to me, then. You're all in a daze today.
do you think we should have gone up there?
to see how they are?
I sent a note, but I thought I'd be in the way. Why?
I thought Mary was rather struck with him last night, didn't you?
well, it must have been frightful for all of them, but there it is.
in the midst of life, we are in death.
I suppose Mr Napier will have to manage everything.
I suppose he will.
we all thought him a very nice gentleman.
Yes, he is nice.
will we be seeing a lot of him?
I don't expect so, no.
because we rather hoped Lady Mary might have taken a shine to him.
seems not.
Oh, well.
there are plenty more fish in the sea than ever came out of it.
are you looking for something? Lady Mary?
I just wanted to make sure the room had been tidied up, after the... after the people had left.
life can be terribly unfair, can't it?
it certainly can.
everything seems so golden, one minute, then turns to ashes, the next.
can I ask you a question, Carson?
have you ever felt your life was somehow...slipping away...
and there was nothing you could do to stop it?
I think everyone feels that, at one time or another.
the odd thing is, I feel...
for the first time, really,
I understand what it is to be happy.
it's just I know that I won't be.
Oh, don't say that, milady.
don't raise the white flag quite yet.
you can still be mistress of Downton.
old Lady Grantham hasn't given up the fight, not by a long chalk.
Oh, that?
I wasn't even thinking about that.
and, if I may say so, milady, you're still very young.
am I?
I don't feel it.
we're all behind you, milady.
the staff, we're all on your side.
thank you, Carson.
you've always been so kind to me.
always.
from when I was quite a little girl.
why is that?
even a butler has his favourites, milady.
does he?
I'm glad.
lady Mary?
Oh, milady. I thought...
Carson and I were just making sure that everything was shipshape and Bristol fashion, and it is.
good night, Carson.
good night, milady.
of all the men on earth, I mean, he looked so fit.
dr Clarkson said it was a heart attack.
did you see any signs?
I didn't have much chance to study the gentleman.
you don't suppose there's anything sinister in it, do you?
every day, the papers warn us of German spies, and they did say his presence was essential for peace in Albania...
I doubt it, milord.
anyone wanting to poison his food would have to get past Mrs Patmore.
blimey, that's a thought.
unless, of course, she's a spy herself.
I wish you'd tell me what's wrong, Bates.
you'll be in no trouble. I only want to help.
I know that, Your Lordship, and I am grateful, but there is nothing I need help with.
good morning, Mrs Hughes. Good morning, milord.
I wonder if you...
now, will you kindly explain what in heaven's name is going on?
I'm perfectly well, Mrs Hughes. A bit stiff, that's all.
just so long as you know, I'm not leaving until you tell me.
I hope you have a strong stomach.
Oh, my God.
cousin Mary?
hello.
are we expecting you?
no, but I wanted to see you.
I looked for you yesterday, at church.
I wasn't feeling up to it.
none of us were.
it must have been a horrible shock.
Yes.
and he seemed a nice fellow. He was.
a very nice fellow.
so, if there's anything I can do...
please ask.
there isn't, but thank you.
well, here goes.
do you not think we ought to say a few words?
what? 'Good riddance'?
that and your promise.
very well.
I promise I will never again try to cure myself.
I will spend my life happily as the butt of others' jokes, and I will never mind them.
we all carry scars, Mr Bates, inside or out.
you're no different to the rest of us, remember that.
I will try to.
that I do promise.
good riddance!
so he definitely went in? I saw him walk through the door.
but you don't know if he went back to his own room?
Yes, I do, coz I was the one who found him there the next day.
what I mean is you don't know if he went back under his own steam.
I suppose not, but how else would he have done it?
that's what they call the big question.
I don't wanna get in any trouble over this.
don't worry, you won't.
your secret's safe with me.
come on, come on! You should be done here!
they'll be back from the station any second now!
I haven't had a chance to ask. How was London?
Oh, much as usual.
dirty, noisy. Quite enjoyable.
there was no need for you to come back a day early.
I'm perfectly capable of getting the house ready.
of course you are. But I'd like to have the heavy luggage back and unpacked before they get here.
I suppose... Steady, William!
this isn't a race.
poor lad.
but he did see her?
I was worried when I took him to King's Cross.
Yes, he had time to say goodbye.
how is he now?
well, you've only got one mother, haven't you?
they're here, Mrs Hughes!
1914/7/1
Hello, William. It's good to have you back.
what a relief to be home.
don't listen when His Lordship pretends not to enjoy the season!
when in Rome...
will Lady Mary be back soon?
she's staying on with my sister for a couple of weeks.
so Grantham House is closed?
it will be by the end of this week.
dear Mrs Hughes, I hope you've had some time to yourself while we've been away.
I've tackled a few jobs that get forgotten when the house's full.
any local news?
the main topic here is the murder of the Austrian Archduke.
here and everywhere else.
I'm afraid we haven't heard the last of that.
how's William? Bearing up.
poor chap. He has our sympathies.
I think I'll wash the train off before dinner.
very good, my lord.
I can unpack while you're bathing.
I'll see you up there.
Oh, Mrs Hughes, have you thought about the garden party for the hospital?
I've started on it, but there are things we need to talk about.
Oh, dear. That sounds like trouble.
I'll take my hat off.
Sybil.
you were a great success in London, darling.
well done.
you never say that to me.
don't I?
you were very helpful, dear. Thank you.
I hate to spoil Her Ladyship's homecoming, but what are we going to do about Mrs Patmore?
she's worse than when you left. Much worse.
and I meant to ask, is there a decision about Mr Bates leaving?
not yet. His Lordship wants the facts and Mr Bates won't give them.
so what are you going to say to Her Ladyship about Mrs Patmore?
Oh, I'm not sure.
I don't want the poor woman sacked, but...things cannot go on as they are.
there's nothing like an English summer, is there?
except an English winter.
I'm sorry you haven't received more invitations.
but then, after four seasons, one is less a debutante than a survivor.
my dear, is there anything you're not telling me?
no. Only, one hears stories.
there's nothing, Aunt Rosamund.
so have you decided
whether or not to marry Cousin Matthew?
Oh, there's no secret Cora can keep for more than a month.
you'd be surprised.
I've told him I'll give him my answer the day I get back.
well, it would be very tidy. At least we can say that.
fancy a smoke? Don't mind if I do.
there they go - Guy Fawkes and his assistant.
which is which? Here you are.
surely, if His Lordship hasn't done anything until now, it means he doesn't want to take it any further.
Anna's made me an armband, Mr Carson.
for my mother. Can I wear it?
I daresay. Not when we're entertaining, but otherwise...
Hello, Doctor. I didn't know you were here.
no. Lady Grantham sent a message.
Why? She's not ill, is she?
Not...ill, exactly.
would you mind waiting in the library?
pregnant?
you needn't be quite so shocked.
give me a moment.
you haven't been pregnant for 18 years!
and I'm pregnant now!
I don't see what we've done differently.
stop right there! If you want to know more, go and offer the doctor some whisky.
I can't take it in.
but...you're pleased?
of course...
of course I'm pleased.
I didn't think she'd do it.
I told you she would.
I could see she was interested.
I was speaking as one lady's maid to another.
that means something!
course, we thought we had him before but he's a slippery devil.
it's unusual, obviously.
unusual? It's Biblical!
not quite.
you understand that women go through a...certain change.
thank you. I know quite as much as I need to about all that.
well, sometimes it can result in a surge of...
fertility, for want of a better word.
but the child will be healthy?
there's no reason why not.
how long has she...?
hard to be precise. Things had become irregular, but...
please...
I'd say she's about four months gone.
it'll begin to show soon.
and I don't suppose there's any way of knowing...if it's a...
I do beg your pardon, my lord. I thought you were alone.
please come in, Mrs Hughes.
I'm just leaving.
William? Well, thank you, Doctor.
I'd better start writing some letters.
show Dr Clarkson out.
I didn't want to bother Her Ladyship if she's not well...
she's resting, but tell me anyway.
it's Mrs Patmore, my lord.
the time has come when we really have to make a decision.
now do you believe me?
careful, Thomas.
your position is not a strong one.
don't punish US, Mr Carson.
it's Mr Bates who's wanting here.
tell me, Mr Carson, do you think it right a man like that should live and work at Downton?
mr Napier, my lady.
what a surprise!
I'm afraid you've just missed my aunt.
I know.
I watched her leave.
how are your wedding plans going?
not very well.
in fact, we've decided to call it off.
Really?
it seemed quite fixed at Sybil's ball.
what a shame... Please.
it'll be better in the long run.
perhaps.
I know what high hopes you have of the institution.
the thing is, Lady Mary, I'm here today because I needed to tell you something face to face, before you went to the country.
face to face? Gracious me.
I've recently heard gossip about the time when I came to Downton with Kemal Pamuk, gossip that I believe has made life difficult for you.
I've also heard it said that I am the source of these stories.
it is very important to me that you should know that I am not.
from that day to this, I have never spoken one word on the matter.
then who did?
it seems to have come from the Turkish Embassy, from the Ambassador himself, in fact, and his wife.
but who told them, if not you?
this is the hard part.
when I discovered the answer, I debated whether I should relay it, but in the end, I feel you ought to know.
the suspense is killing me.
it was your sister, Lady Edith, who wrote to the Ambassador.
that is why people accept the story.
Edith?
it's very hard to believe.
harder for you than for me.
I love the thought of a baby in the house, but if it's a boy...
it'll be very hard on Mr Crawley.
I know. I was no great champion when he first arrived.
but it seems to me he's tried his best and he's done the decent thing.
I can't see THAT coming off.
you don't mean the engagement?
but it's not an engagement yet, is it?
she'd never throw him over!
mr Carson, Lady Mary Crawley does not deserve you.
and she's not been in touch with cousin Matthew?
not that I've heard.
wonderful news, of course. You must look after yourself.
don't worry. O'Brien has me wrapped in silk and feathers.
you're lucky.
I have a horrible feeling Simmons is about to hand in her notice.
she's looking very fidgety lately, and I saw her hurrying to meet the postman.
Oh, you poor thing.
is there anything worse than losing one's maid?
why would she want to leave me?
I've been as gentle as a lamb.
most of the time.
I want to say I'll make provision for you if it's a boy and you get pushed out.
don't worry. I know you can't.
if any man living understands the strength of the entail, it's me.
I can give you Crawley House for life, if it's a help.
have you heard from Mary?
no. Have you?
by the way, I want to ask a favour. What's the name of your cook, the one you brought with you from Manchester?
Mrs Bird?
I'll get it, Mrs Patmore!
don't fuss me!
is that everything? Yeah.
how are you feeling?
well, most people's parents die before them, and so they should.
Oh, give it a rest. Your mother knew how to drag it out.
what? Thomas!
get up to the servery.
you gave me the wrong cloth!
sit down, Mrs Patmore.
I can't when I've got the luncheon to finish!
it was not a suggestion. Sit!
Daisy and I will finish the luncheon.
so he'll give us this house for life, will he? How generous.
it IS generous. He doesn't have to.
but it's made me think.
you must stay here if you want.
but I wonder if it mightn't be better all round if I went back to Manchester.
it may not be a boy.
Oh, really, Mother!
you never approved of it all anyway!
if it is a boy, you should see it as a release, not a disappointment.
what does Mary say?
nothing yet.
you wanted to see Mrs Bird, sir.
Yes. Mrs Bird, Lord Grantham has rather a favour to ask of you.
I'm surprised Lord Grantham knows that I exist, sir.
I'm sorry to disturb you. Quite all right.
mr Bates, it's about your somewhat startling confession.
as you'll have surmised, His Lordship has yet to make a decision.
his delay is generous.
however, it will be no surprise to you that Miss O'Brien has been unwilling to let things drop.
it seems that when we were in London, she made a new friend
a lady's maid in the house of a colonel in your former regiment.
please tell me that this account is false, at least in part.
I wish I could.
I'll have to show this to His Lordship.
of course you will.
I do not like to play the part of Pontius Pilate, but I'm afraid I must.
lord Grantham will decide what's to be done.
mr Bates, I hope you do not feel that I treated you unjustly.
on the contrary, Mr Carson,
I am astonished at your kindness.
of all of you,
Sybil might find joy in a cottage, but not you.
we don't know it'll be a boy. Exactly.
so ask Matthew to wait until the child is born.
if it's a girl, you can wed him happily and all will be as it was before.
but if I delay, won't he think I'm only after him for his position?
besides, I'm not sure I want to put him off, even without the title.
we get on so well, you know. And he's terribly clever.
he might end up Lord Chancellor.
and he might not.
Oh, come along, Mary, be sensible.
can you really see yourself dawdling your life away as the wife of a country solicitor?
but why would we ever want a telephone at Downton, my lord?
well, they have their uses.
you could speak to the housekeeper in London.
that'd be helpful, surely?
I hope I have not failed in my management of the recent move?
not at all. But the telephone is here now, and the girls got used to it when we were in London.
besides, none of us know what the next few months will bring.
because of the Archduke's death?
austria won't get what it wants from Serbia.
and now Russia's starting to rumble.
well, there's not much we can do about that.
so, will you take care of the telephone man?
Oh, about Mr Bates, my lord.
I expect you've had time to consider the contents of that letter?
Yes. But I find it very odd.
regimental silver?
I could more easily see Bates as an assassin than a petty pilferer.
I agree. And while the letter is hard to argue with,
I wouldn't put anything past Thomas or Miss O'Brien.
so, what did we miss?
nothing much.
although you'd have had more invitations than I did.
have you thought about Matthew?
of course. But Aunt Rosamund says...
she's written to me. Pay no attention.
but Granny, she has got a point.
Mary can't be completely naive.
I don't need your help, thank you.
Mary, listen to me.
if you take Matthew now, when his whole future is at risk, he will love you to the end of his days.
why, Granny, you're a romantic!
I've been called many things, but never that.
and what happens if the baby is a boy and Matthew loses everything?
Mary can always change her mind.
I can't do that to Matthew.
it's not how we are together.
I'm going upstairs to help Anna unpack.
I'll come with you.
Edith, why don't you go too?
sir Anthony Strallan was at Lady Wren's party.
he asked after you.
is she really serious about him?
any port in a storm...
by the way, I was right about my maid.
she's leaving, to get married.
how could she be so selfish?
I do sympathise.
Robert's always wanted me to get rid of O'Brien, but I can't face it.
anyway, she's so fond of me.
well, I thought Simmons was fond of ME!
what am I to do?
I'll put an advertisement in The Lady.
it's always the best place to start.
Oh! That's so kind.
thank you.
I really must be going.
now, don't let Mary wait for the baby before she gives Matthew her answer.
I'm sure it's another girl.
I know those men of the moral high ground.
if she won't say yes when he might be poor, he won't want her when he will be rich.
maybe we should knit something.
Oh, yes, I'm sure they'd love a pair of bootees knitted by you.
or what about a Christening mug? They can buy their own silver.
anything in the paper?
they've arrested Principle and his gang.
all Serbian and members of the Black Hand.
the Black Hand? I don't like the sound of that.
I don't like the sound of any of it.
war is on the way.
then we'll have to face it as bravely as we can.
thank you, Mr Cannon Fodder.
don't YOU think a war's coming?
Oh, there'll be a war, and it's time to prepare for it.
the country, do you mean? No. Me.
you never disappoint.
Daisy, run and find Mrs Patmore.
his Lordship wants to see her in the library.
his Lordship wants Mrs Patmore to go up to the library?
that is what I said.
and Anna, you're to come too.
and we thought the assassination of an archduke was a surprise.
Mrs Patmore, my lord.
your Lordship, I know things haven't been quite right for a while, but I can assure you
come in, Mrs Patmore.
I promise you, my lord, if I could just be allowed a bit more time...
Mrs Patmore, I have not asked you here to give you your notice.
haven't you? No.
I understand you've had some trouble with your sight.
that's just it!
I know I could manage better if
please, Mrs Patmore. Let him speak!
beg pardon, my lord. Don't apologise.
now, on Dr Clarkson's recommendation,
I'm sending you up to London to see an eye specialist at Moorfields.
Anna will go with you and you'll stay with my sister Rosamund in her new house in Belgrave Square.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to sit in your presence, my lord.
of course.
but how will you get on here?
well, Mrs Crawley is lending us her cook - Mrs Bird.
she's coming over tomorrow.
you will be good enough to show her how things work.
are the Crawleys to starve while I'm away?
they'll eat here every evening.
now, my sister's butler will look after you.
he's very nice.
Anna, you won't mind a visit to London?
no, my lord. Thank you. It'll be an adventure.
one with a happy ending, I hope.
let me get clear. At Sybil's ball you said you'd give me your answer the day you got back, and now you say you will not!
why do we have to rush into it?
I need to be sure, that's all.
but you WERE sure.
I know what has altered you. My prospects!
because nothing else has changed!
No! Yes!
if your mother's child is a boy, then he's the heir and I go back to living on my wits!
and you'd rather not follow me.
Oh, Matthew, you always make everything so black and white!
I think this IS NOT black and white!
do you love me enough to spend your life with me?
if you don't, then say no.
if you do, then say yes. I want to...
granny told me I should say yes now, then withdraw if you lost everything.
to make that work, you'd have to be a good liar.
are you a good liar?
not good enough to try, apparently.
how could you not have realised they'd discover the loss at once?
and to keep them in your house...
but you only served two years?
that's right, my lord.
so, clearly the judge thought there was some mitigating factor.
I just want to know the truth.
I cannot speak of it, my lord.
you must decide whether I stay or go on the basis of the evidence before you.
I will respect that.
I'm sorry. I don't believe it.
how can you say that? When I've confessed to the crime?
his Lordship obviously doesn't think that's all there is to it, and I don't either.
Anna, are you set for the nine o'clock train tomorrow?
all packed and ready.
you'll be met at King's Cross by Lady Rosamund's chauffeur, which I think is generous, but after that, you're on your own.
right, I must get on.
I'm acting referee for Mrs Patmore and Mrs Bird.
best of luck.
will you miss me?
try not to miss me.
it'll be good practice.
I expect it'll be hard adjusting to this kitchen, after the one you're used to.
not to worry.
I'm sure I can have it cleaned up in no time.
cleaned up?
I'm not criticising.
with your eyesight, it's a wonder you could see the pots at all.
you'll have met Daisy and the others?
I have.
though what they all find to do is a mystery to me.
are you not used to managing staff, Mrs Bird?
I'm used to getting it done with one kitchen maid, Mrs Patmore, but I suppose, in a house like this, you expect to take it easy.
do you think we should erect a ring and let them fight it out?
she's all right, Mrs Bird.
she's more of a general than a trooper, but...
you need that in a cook.
Mrs Patmore's the Generalissimo.
well, I'm very sad.
I thought Mary was made of better stuff.
don't speak against her.
of course, she's taken advice from someone with false and greedy values. Oh, mother!
and we don't have to go too far to know who that is!
I've a good mind - Mother!
you do not go near Violet. That is an order.
something's not right about it. I agree.
having a silver thief in the house does not seem right at all, even if he COULD walk.
but Carson isn't keen to get rid of him either, and he normally comes down on this sort of thing very hard.
what's his reasoning?
he blames Thomas and O'Brien.
he says they've been working against Bates since he got here.
so I should sack O'Brien instead?
you'll hear no argument from me.
this should do the trick, my lady.
ten years of my life, That's what I've given her.
ten bloody years!
but did she say she'd sack you?
it's obviously what he wants.
so when will they tell you?
when they've found a replacement.
heaven forefend she'd have to put a comb through her own hair!
and if I'm going, you won't be far behind.
Oh, so what? Sod 'em.
there's a war coming and war means change.
we should be making plans.
what are you talking about?
well, put it like this. I don't want to be a footman any more, but I don't intend to be killed in battle neither.
I'm not saying poison them!
just make sure they don't find her food all that agreeable.
by poisoning it? Will you stop that?
you don't want it to taste nice.
I want them to be glad when I get back, that's all.
this will be for the family and the one in the pantry will be for the staff
we don't normally provide two, then perhaps we should find another supplier whoa whoa, hold your horses, all right, where do you see this other telephone?
Yeah, in the outer hall.
good afternoon, Carson. Is Lady Edith in?
I am!
I most certainly am! I was just driving past.
yes?
I thought you might like to come for a spin. If you're not too busy.
wait till I get my coat.
is it all right if I make some notes?
I'm so sorry, Mr...?
this is Mr Bromidge, my lady.
he's here about the telephone.
Oh, please make your notes, dear Mr Bromidge.
we're so looking forward to it.
what an exciting business to be in!
you must be expanding every day.
Oh, we are, sir.
but that brings its problems.
training up men for the work, when many have no aptitude.
I can't even find a secretary who can keep pace.
what? It's hard with a new concept.
too old, and they can't change.
too young, and they've no experience.
have you filled the post yet? I know just the woman.
well, she must hurry up. We'll close the list tomorrow night.
you'll have her application. I promise.
MOORFIELD EYE HOSPITAL
this isn't bad at all, is it? I don't know.
no-one told me there'd be an actual operation.
what did you think?
they were just going to make magic passes over your eyes?
all right, Mrs...Patmore?
she'll be fine. Thank you.
and you've been sent to us by the Earl of Grantham?
that's right.
very good. You can leave her now.
we'll keep her in for a week.
you can collect her next Friday.
I'll be in to visit every day.
what about the rest of the time?
don't worry!
you'll be fine.
Bates, you say? John Bates.
he must have left the army about eight years ago.
wait here, please.
have you finished the soup? I think so, Mrs Bird.
and the sauce for the fish? Yes, Mrs Bird.
you can put them in the warmer.
you don't mean John Bates, who went to prison for theft?
that's correct.
well, I know who he is right enough.
that was an odd business.
why odd?
never mind.
so you're his cousin and you'd like to be in touch?
very forgiving.
I've got no address for him or his wife.
but I have got one for his mother, which should still be good.
I've written it down for you.
thank you for your trouble.
is it true you wrote to the Turkish Ambassador about Kemal?
who told you? Someone who knows that you did.
then why are you asking?
because I wanted to give you one last chance to deny it.
and what if I did?
he had a right to know how his countryman died.
in the arms of a slut.
how's that advertisement getting on for new maid?
well, it's only just come out.
william and I can manage here now.
tell Mrs Bird we'll have our dinner in 20 minutes.
Carson, be sure to say to Mrs Bird the dinner was really delicious.
Oh, thank you.
so, how was the drive?
it was lovely.
only... Yes?
well, he said he had a question for me.
he told me he'd ask it at the garden party and...
he hoped I'd say yes.
you must think very carefully what your answer will be.
Yes, I should think very carefully about a lot of things.
do your neighbours have one?
Yes, they do. In London anyway.
it seems wise to get a telephone now.
if there is a war, it may be hard to have one installed in a private house.
let me show you where we're going to put it.
first electricity now telephones.
sometimes I feel as if I were living in an HG Wells novel.
but the young are all so calm about change, aren't they?
look at Matthew.
I do admire him.
do you?
what have I done wrong now? Oh, please.
don't pretend Mary's sudden reluctance can't be traced back to you.
well, I shall pretend it. I told her to take him.
your quarrel is with my daughter Rosamund, not me.
so put that in your pipe and smoke it!
mr Molesley.
what are you after?
I want a word with Mr Carson. I'm here to have my dinner.
you don't want much, do you? What are you doing?
mr Carson dropped his wallet in the passage. I was replacing it.
but everything seemed so settled between you at Sybil's ball.
things have changed since then.
not necessarily.
I don't seem to be much good at making boys.
any more than I'm much good at building my life on shifting sands.
you do know I should be very proud to have you as my son-in-law, whatever your prospects?
unfortunately, sir...
your daughter is more practical than you.
will you join us, Mrs Bird?
I don't mind if I do.
I'm not sure Mrs Patmore would like that, Mr Carson.
cook always eats separate, that's what she says.
not in our house. There's only four of us.
well, you're going any minute.
she's advertised for your replacement.
that filthy, ungrateful cow.
let the kitchen maids have theirs on their own. You stay with us.
her Ladyship said to tell you that the dinner was delicious.
she can't have! Daisy? Does that surprise you?
what have you done with this, you little beggar?
I knew it!
that's why I said it was for upstairs.
come on! Tell us what's in it!
Just...water and...a bit of soap.
and you've put something in the fish sauce as well?
Only...mustard and aniseed.
why, Daisy? Why would you do such a thing?
Mrs Patmore was worried they'd prefer Mrs Bird's cooking and they wouldn't want her to come back. Is that likely?
when they've taken such trouble to get her well?
I'm sorry!
there, there.
there are worse crimes on earth than loyalty.
dry your eyes, and fetch the beef stew I was making for tomorrow.
you've not had a chance to spoil that, I suppose?
I was going to mix in some syrup of figs, but I've not done it yet.
at least we'd all have been regular.
Carson said you were here.
just checking that everything's being done right, my lady.
only, we never heard back.
that is, Miss Dawson never heard back, about an interview?
er, yes, we got the young lady's letter.
but the trouble is, she didn't have any obvious experience of hard work that I can tell.
but she's a very hard worker!
I couldn't find any proof of it.
and she gave you as a reference, when you don't run a business, well, not that I'm aware of.
Lily? Can you find Gwen and tell her to come to the hall now?
Yes, my lady.
the reason Gwen didn't give any more details is because she works here, as a housemaid.
Ah! And you thought that'd put me off?
but she's taken a postal course and has good speeds in typing and Pitman shorthand. Test her!
I will, if I like the look of her.
Ah, so, young lady.
you thought I'd turn up my nose at a housemaid?
well, I did, sir. Well, my mother was a housemaid.
I've got nothing against housemaids.
they know about hard work and long hour, that's for sure.
I believe so, sir.
right, well, is there somewhere we could talk?
Gwen, take Mr Bromidge to the library.
I'll see no-one disturbs you.
sorry, Papa, you can't go in there.
why on earth not?
Gwen's in there with Mr Bromidge. She's being interviewed.
I cannot use my library because one of the housemaids is in there applying for another job?
that's about the size of it.
so, what is it you want to know?
I want to know the truth about the case against him.
I want to know why the Sergeant thought it was 'odd'.
I want to know what Mr Bates isn't saying.
because you don't believe him to be guilty?
no, I don't.
I know he's not.
well...
you're right, of course.
then who was it?
who was the thief?
his wife. Vera.
who do you call?
no-one you know has got one!
but they will have. You'll see.
might I enquire why my pantry has become a common room?
sorry, Mr Carson.
but...do you know how it works?
of course I do. Could you show us?
certainly not. A telephone is not a toy, but a useful and valuable tool. Now, get back to your work.
she worked at the barracks sometimes, helping at big dinners and so on.
that night her opportunity came and she took it.
they knew it was her.
someone even saw her with a big carryall.
but why did he confess?
well...
John wasn't the same man in those days.
the African war had shaken him up and made him angry.
he'd been wounded and he drunk a lot more than was good for him.
was he violent? No. No, not violent.
he could be hard at times, with a tongue like a razor.
he felt he'd ruined Vera's life, Miss Smith.
do you agree with him?
no.
I thought she was a nasty piece of work.
that's why he took the blame.
surely, if everyone knew he was innocent...
but he confessed!
there was nothing anybody could do once he'd confessed.
could I ask you something, sir? Only...
I get the feeling that a war's on the way.
I'm afraid we all do.
and when it comes, I want to be really useful to my country.
how heartening.
so I've been thinking, what could be more useful than what you do?
bringing people back to health, back to life.
I see.
well, erm, we are looking for volunteers to train for the Territorial Force hospitals, if that's what you mean. It's exactly what I mean.
will you not be missed here?
maybe. But we'll all be going, won't we?
the younger men, anyway.
as you wish. I'll make enquiries.
thank you very much, Doctor.
mr Molesley walked in and there he was, as bold as brass, taking my wallet out of my change coat.
mr Molesley would have no reason to make it up, my lord.
he doesn't know Thomas. Why would he lie?
so Thomas has been caught red-handed.
well, we knew he was a thief.
and now we have unimpeachable proof.
I'm afraid he has to go.
Oh, I hate this sort of thing, with Lady Grantham's condition and so on.
can we at least wait until after the garden party?
very well, my lord. But then I think we must act.
how long will you wear them? A week or so.
but I can see much better already, even with them on.
thank heaven.
now, we need to talk about the garden party.
Mrs Bird and I have made some lists.
Mrs Bird?
I think we can manage without any help from Mrs Bird.
can you?
well, if you want your garden party to be run by Blind Pugh, that's your business.
Mrs Patmore, there's a lot to be done and you're only just up on your feet.
we really cannot manage without Mrs Bird. If you say so.
now, I've been checking the stores and I've ordered what you'll need for the baking.
that's very kind, Mrs Hughes, but I believe WE should check the stores, when it's convenient.
Mrs Bird, at Downton Abbey, the housekeeper manages the store cupboard, but I think you will find
I've never not run my own store cupboard in my life.
separate the cook from the store cupboard?
Where's the sense in that?
how long have I been saying this, oh, Lord?
we're the ones who cook it. We should be the ones to order it.
Mrs Bird, I shall be very happy with your help with the garden party.
I'm sure we can manage it easily... between the two of us.
Hello?
this is Downton Abbey.
Carson the butler speaking.
hello.
this is Mr Carson, the butler, of Downton Abbey.
to whom am I speaking?
but I'm not shouting!
who are YOU?
Oh. Mrs Gaunt.
no, I don't want to place a call.
I was practising my answer.
well, I daresay a lot of the things you do sound stupid to other people!
I've written to your mother. She's very anxious, naturally.
she suggested coming over. Oh, God.
well, that's what I thought. So I put her off.
told her to come and admire the baby.
I'll just run Your Ladyship's bath.
thank you, O'Brien.
Oh, have you had any answers about the position?
quite a few.
so what did they sound like?
one I think has real possibilities.
she learned to do hair in Paris while working for the Ambassadress.
Oh, sounds promising.
Carson, I've been meaning... Your Lordship?
Anna, you're back safely, then?
Yes, thank you, my lord.
and Mrs Patmore's fighting fit again.
fighting fit' is the phrase!
is something the matter?
I wanted to see Your Lordship because... Please.
while I was in London, I learned something about Mr Bates.
not bad, I hope. No. Not bad at all.
I'd have told Mr Carson, but I thought you might like to hear it from me first.
go on.
I went to call on Mr Bates's mother.
O'brien, how long do you think it takes a lady's maid to settle in?
depends on the maid, my lady.
of course it does.
oops! Sorry.
the other half's under the bath.
never mind. Thank you.
I'll just go and sort out your clothes, my lady.
thank you.
Sarah O'Brien, this is not who you are.
my lady, if you could just wait...
the doctor's gone your Lordship, but he's coming back after dinner.
lady Mary's with her now.
thank you.
I don't suppose you want to change but if there's anything else I can do to be useful.
it was a boy.
I'm sorry I don't mean to embarrass you.
I'm not embarrassed.
I just wish you could've been spared this. I know you do.
thank you.
by the way Anna's told me what she learned in London.
has she?
she's not told me.
well, the good news is you won't be leaving Downton.
and I need some good news today.
that poor wee babe.
how's her Ladyship doing?
I'll take her up a tray in a minute but I dare say she won't touch a bite.
what about you, Miss O'brian?
what about me?
that must have been quite a shock.
Yes, yes, it was.
I think you'd better dine with us Mr Branson.
we can't know if you might be needed later.
well, I'm to go for the doctor at ten.
what a long-face lot.
kindly show some respect!
come on, Mr Carson, she'll get over it.
they're no bigger than a hamster at that stage.
will you shut up?
I agree. What is the matter with you Thomas?
I don't know. Suppose all this makes me feel claustrophobic.
I mean I'm sorry, of course, I am.
but why must we live through them?
they're just our employers, they're not our flesh and blood.
Thomas, don't be so unkind.
is there nothing left on earth that you respect?
look at him.
blimey if he carries on like this for the unborn baby of a woman who scarcely knows his name, no wonder he fell to pieces when his old mom snuffed it.
William!
Thomas, William stop it! That is enough!
calm down!
Oh Thomas.
I've done as I promised.
general Burton is commanding the Division of Richmond.
I think I may have a place there for you.
under Colonel Cartwright... These are the papers.
when you're ready, report to the local recruiting office and they will take it from there.
as a matter of fact I'm being drafted back as a Captain so...
I'll try to keep an eye on you.
that's very kind of you doctor. With any luck, there may be some advantage in your having volunteered so early.
hang on a minute.
now give me yours and take these ones at the same time.
William, I'm sorry
I've been so unkind to you lately.
Oh, that's alright.
no, it's not alright. I don't know why I said those things.
you were under an evil spell.
I'm not under anymore.
I'm glad. Friends?
always friends.
I think we should start the ices now.
if you agree Mrs Patmore.
certainly Mrs Bird.
Oh, my lord. Listen to that.
it's like the cry of the banshee.
mr Carson's telephone's ringing.
isn't there someone going to answer it?
I wouldn't take that thing with a ten-foot pole!
I'll then.
is Carson there? No, Mr Carson's busy.
can I take a message?
I wish ours was.
I've got news my lady.
sorry.
mr Bromidge has rung.
you've done it Gwen, you've got the job!
take it,take it.
something to celebrate?
I've got the job Mrs Hughs. I'm a secretary.
I've begun.
I'm very happy for you Gwen and we'll celebrate after we finish today's work.
of course Mrs Hughs.
I don't suppose... Lady Sybil.
her Ladyship's asking after you.
be careful my lad.
or you'll end up with no job and a broken heart.
what do you mean?
I don't seem to be able to find your sister.
I wonder where she is.
of course she may have been cornered.
I know there're some old bore she was trying to dodge.
who was that?
I'm not sure. He's simply ghastly apparently.
but he's promised to propose today.
I can't tell you how funny she was when she acted it out.
she ought to go on the stage! Really?
how amusing.
well done Mrs Hughs. Beautifully executed as always.
key is in the planning.
mr Carson this probably isn't the moment but I've just heard from doctor Clarkson
I've been accepted for a training scheme.
for the army medical Corps.
have you indeed?
yes and I want to do it so I'll be handing in my notice.
I'll serve at the moment, of course.
thank you Thomas we can talk about it later.
and you couldn't have planned that any better either.
you can't be leaving yet.
I'm afraid I must.
please make my excuses to your mother.
but I...
I wish you'd come inside my lady.
no.
people mustn't think I'm really ill.
I don't wanna cast a dampener on the party.
very well.
but are you sure you have everything you need my lady.
dear O'brian.
how sweet you are.
O'Brian? O'brian.
can I have a word?
I need a favor and I don't want to bother Mrs Grantham with it.
certainly my lady.
she's been helping me find a new maid.
and we've had quite a few answers from her ads.
can you find where she's put them and get Branson to bring them to the Dowager House?
her Ladyship's helping you find a new lady's maid. Yes.
we should've asked you, really.
you might take a look at the letters if you have a minute?
there's one we like the sound of who's been trained in Paris.
do you know where she might put them?
the answers?
Oh yes my lady.
there're only 2 or 3 places they could be.
thank you O'brian. You're a treasure. Thank you.
I didn't know a garden party was a spectator sport.
pretty though, isn't it?
hard to believe the clouds're gathering on a summer's day like this.
mr Bates.
I know you think I was wrong to call on your mother.
I don't think that.
she likes you by the way.
I had to find out the truth.
but you see, you don't know the whole truth.
not even now you know my mother's truth.
and not your wife's.
Where's she now? I couldn't tell you.
I'd better to get back.
you're here Mr Molsely I didn't know that.
just helping out.
nice girl, that Anna.
do you know if she's got anyone special in her life?
I'd like to say she hasn't.
I would truly but there's someone yes.
do you think he's keen on her, or is it worth a go?
well, he keeps himself to himself it's hard to read it at times but...
I'd say he's keen. He says he's very keen indeed.
Daisy, I said ices, not iced cakes.
now unclog your ears and get these to William before they turn into soup.
but I don't understand, nothing's changed.
everything's changed.
you can't be sure I was going to refuse you even if it had been a boy.
because I'm not. That's the point.
I can't be sure...
of you or of anything it seems.
the last few weeks have taught me that.
but you can't leave Downton.
I can't stay. Not now.
what will you tell papa?
but I'm grateful for what he's trying to do.
but the experiment is at an end.
I'm not a puppet,
I must take charge of my own life again.
would you've stayed, if I'd accepted you?
of course.
so I've ruined everything?
you've shown me I've been living in a dream.
it's time to return to real life.
wish me luck with it Mary.
God know I wish the best for you.
well, Rosamond,
I'm afraid your meddling has cost Mary the only decent offer she'll ever get.
I'm sorry mama. But you know me
I have to say what I think.
Why?
no body else does.
are you quite well my lady?
of course. You know me Carson.
I'm never down for long.
I know you have spirit my lady.
that's what counts.
it's all that counts in the end.
there, there.
so Mary is to be denied her countess' coronet after all?
don't crow at me.
I think she's very foolish not to take him when she could.
and I've told her so.
well, if I'm perfectly honest
I wonder if Matthew's making the same mistake right now.
are you warm enough?
I am when you're holding my hands.
your Lordship this has just arrived for you. Thank you.
Oh, and I'm happy to tell you that
thomas has just handed in his notice.
so we'll be spared any unpleasantness on that score.
what a relief.
please, would you stop please?
my lords, ladies and gentlemen.
can I ask for silence?
because I very much regret to announce that we're at war with Germany.
act ONE
so that's, you know, coming along.
I'm working with a vocal coach, strengthening the...
lotta guys ignore the laugh.
and that's about standards.
I mean, if you're gonna get into the Evil League of Evil, you have to have a memorable laugh.
what, do you think Bad Horse didn't work on his whinny?
his terrible death-whinny...
no response, BTW, from the League yet, but my application is strong this year.
a letter of condemnation from the Deputy Mayor.
that's gotta have some weight, so...
emails.

what's going on?
life a' crime. Got your mail.
Hey, didn't you, uh...didn't you go on a date last night?
conflict Diamond told me you were doubling with Bait and Switch.
Yeah.
yeah?
it was all right.
I kinda thought I was supposed to end up with Bait, - but... - I hear ya.
I saw Penny today.
you talk to her?
so close.
I'm just a few weeks away from a real, audible connection.
I'm... I'm gonna ask...
Oh, my God.
is that from the League?
it's from him. That's his seal, isn't it?
the... the leader? Oh, my God.
I got a letter from Bad Horse.
that's so hardcore. Bad Horse is legend.
he rules the League with an iron hoof.

are you kidding?
this is great!
I am about to pull a major heist.
you know the wonderflonium that I need for the Freeze Ray?
it's being transported tomorrow.
armored car?
courier van.
you need anything dampened or made soggy?
Thanks, but...
the League is watching.
I gotta go this alone.

Aah! - Oh!
Aah. Ahh. Hah.
what?
um, l... l... I was wondering if I could just...
Hey. I know you.
hello.
you know me? Cool.
I mean... yeah, you do. Do you?
from the Laundromat.
Wednesdays and Saturdays.
except twice last month you skipped the weekend.
or, if that was you. It could have been someone else.
I mean, I've seen you.
Billy, is my name. - I'm Penny.
what are you doing?
um, texting.
it's very important or I would stop.
what are you doing?
actually, I'm out here volunteering for The Caring Hands Homeless Shelter.
can you spare a minute?
um... okay, go.
okay.
um, we're hoping to open a new location soon...
expand our efforts.
there's this great building nearby that the city is just going to demolish and turn into a parking lot.
but if we get enough signatures...
signatures?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, go on.
I was saying, um, maybe we could get the city to donate the building to our cause.
we would be able to provide 250 new beds.
get people off the streets and into job training...
so they can buy rocket packs and go to the moon and become florists.
you're not really interested in the homeless, are you?
no, I am.
but they're a symptom.
you're treating a symptom.
and the disease rages on, consumes the human race.
the fish rots from the head, as they say, so my thinking is why not cut off the head.
of the human race?
it's not a perfect metaphor.
but I'm talking about an overhaul of the system.
putting the power in different hands.
I'm all for that.
this petition is about the building.
I'd love to sign it.
thank you.
I'm sorry, l... I come on strong.
but you signed.
well, wouldn't want to turn my back on a fellow... laundry... person.
well, if we can't stick together, I don't...
WONDERFLONIUM, DO NOT BOUNCE
I'll probably see you there.
no, I will. I'Il...
she talked to me.
why did she talk to me now?
maybe I should...

coin WASH
it is so dumb that we've been coming here so long and never spoke.
I know.
all those months doing a stunningly boring chore.
I'm a fan of laundry.
psych! I love it.
the smell of fabric softener. - Mmm.
the feel of warm clothes in your hands. - So good.
Hey, this is weird.
I ordered one frozen yogurt and they gave me two.
you don't happen to like frozen yogurt do you?
I love it. - You're kidding.
what a crazy, random happenstance.
here. - Thank you.
so, how was your weekend?
did you spend the whole time hunting wild signatures?
um, actually, I went on a date.
get right outta town. How was that?
unexpected.
he's a really good-Iooking guy, and I thought he was kind of cheesy at first...
trust your instincts.
but he turned out to be totally sweet.
sometimes people are layered like that.
there's something totally different underneath than what's on the surface.
and sometimes there's a third, even deeper level.
and that one is the same as the top, surface one.
huh? - Like with pie.
so you gonna see him again?
I think I will.
Ohh.
Billy? - Yeah?
you're driving the spork into your leg.
so I am.
hilarious!
all right. The wait is over.
all right. The wait is over.
this, my friends, is my Freeze Ray which with the addition of the wonderflonium.
I obtained at my famously successful heist last week...
I say successful in that I achieved my objective.
it was less successful in that I inadvertently introduced my arch-nemesis to the girl of my dreams and now he's taking her out on dates and they're probably going to French kiss or something.
she called him sweet.
how is he sweet?
right! Freeze Ray.
so, as of tonight, I am in the Evil League of Evil if all goes according to plan, which it will, because I hold a Ph. D. In Horribleness.
peace.
but not literally.
the Freeze Ray needs work.
I also need to be a little bit more careful about what I say on this blog.
apparently the L.A.P.D. and Captain Hammer are among our viewers.
they were waiting for me at the Mayor's dedication of the Superhero Memorial Bridge.
the Freeze Ray takes a few seconds to warm up and I wasn't...
captain Hammer threw a car at my head.
not to worry, though, because I'm...
Oh, one sec.
# He saw the operation you tried to pull today #
# But your humiliation #
# Means he still votes "neigh" #
# And now assassination is just the only way #
# There will be blood, it might be yours #
# So go kill someone, signed Bad Horse #
kill someone?
would you do it?
to get into the Evil League of Evil?
at my most badass, I make people feel like they want to take a shower.
I'm not E.L.E. Material.
killing's not elegant or creative.
it's not my style.
you've got more than enough evil hours to get into the henchman's union.
I'm not a henchman.
I'm Dr. Horrible.
I've got a Ph.D. In Horribleness.
is that the new catch-phrase?
I deserve to get in.
you know I do.
but killing? Really?
hourglass says she knows a kid in Iowa who grows up to become president.
that'd be big.
I'm not gonna kill a little kid.
smother an old lady?
do I even know you?
I just, you know, really think
I just, you know, really think
I'm qualified for this, this job and I just can't get my foot in the door.
I'm sure you will.
I wanna do great things, you know?
I wanna be an achiever, like Bad Horse.
the Thoroughbred of Sin?
I meant Gandhi.
well, I've gotten turned down from plenty of jobs.
even fired a few times.
I can't imagine anybody firing you.
neither could I.
now I can visualize it really well.
but you know, everything happens...
don't say for a reason.
No! I'm just saying that everything happens.
not to me.
# Here's a story of a girl who grew up lost and Ionely #
# Thinking love was fairytale #
# And trouble was made only for me #
# Even in the darkness #
# Every color can be found #
# And every day of rain #
# Brings water flowing to things growing in the ground#
# Grief replaced with pity #
# For a city barely coping #
# Dreams are easy to achieve #
# If hope is all I'm hoping to be #
# Anytime you're hurt there's one who has it worse around #
# And every drop of rain #
# Will keep you growing #
# Seeds you're sowing in the ground #
# So keep your head up Billy, buddy #
it's like Captain Hammer is always saying...
right, him.
how are things with cheesy-on-the-outside?
good. They're good.
he's nice. - Hmm.
I'll be interested to know what you think of him.
he said he might stop by.
stop by here?
Yeah.
Oh, goodness. Look at my wrist.
I gotta go. - But...
but, what about your clothes?
I don't love these. See ya!
Aah! - Oh, pardon.
pardon.
Billy, this is Captain Hammer.
Oh, Billy, the laundry buddy.
well it is very nice to meet you.
we're meeting now for the first time.
you look horribly familiar.
one of those faces, I guess.
have I seen you at the gym?
at the gym.
I don't go to the gym.
I'm just naturally like this.
Oh, well.
who wants to know what the Mayor is doing behind closed doors?
he is signing over a certain building to a Caring Hands group as a new homeless shelter.
Oh, my God!
Yep. Apparently the only signature he needed was my fist.
but with a pen in it.
that I was signing with.
I... I can't believe it.
Congratulations.
thank... thank you. Thank you!
Oh.
Ohh.
well, this is great.
I wish I could stay and chit-chat.
well, it sure was nice to meet you... Doctor.
you got a little crush, don't you, Doc?
well, that's gonna make this hard to hear.
see, later, I'm going to take little Penny back to my place, show her the command center, the Hammer cycle.
maybe even the Ham-jet.
you think she likes me now?
I'm gonna give Penny the night of her life just because you want her.
and I get... what you want.
see, Penny's giving it up.
she's giving it up hard, 'cause she's with Captain Hammer.
and these are not the hammer.
the hammer is my penis.
# This appeared as a moral dilemma #
# Cause at first it was weird though I swore to eliminate #
# The worst of the plague that devoured humanity #
# It's true I was vague on the "how" #
# So how can it be that you have shown me the light #
# It's a brand new day #
# And the sun is high #
# All the birds are singing that you're gonna die #
# How I hesitated #
# Now I wonder why #
# It's a brand new day #
# All the times that you beat me unconscious, I forgive #
# All the crimes incomplete, listen, honestly I'll live #
# Mr. Cool, Mr. Right, Mr. Know-it-all is through #
# Now the future's so bright and I owe it all to you #
# Who showed me the light #
# It's a brand new me #
# I got no remorse #
# Now the water's rising #
# But I know the course #
# I'm gonna shock the world #
# Gonna show Bad Horse #
# It's a brand new day #
# And Penny will see the evil me #
# Not a joke, not a dork, not a failure #
# And she may cry but her tears will dry #
# When I hand her the keys to a shiny new Australia #
# It's a brand new day #
# Yeah, the sun is high #
# All the angels sing #
# Because you're gonna die #
# Go ahead and laugh #
# Yeah, I'm a funny guy #
# Tell everyone goodbye #
# It's a brand new day #
act THREE

it's a good day to be homeless.
it certainly is.

thank you. Thank you.
justice has a name.
and the name that it has... besides "Justice..."is Captain Hammer.
ladies and gentlemen, your hero.
thank you.
thank you, Mayor, for those kind words.
I hate the homelessness problem that plagues our city.
everyone should have the basic...
you know what, I don't need tiny cue-cards.
when I fell deeply in love with my serious long-term girlfriend Penny...
wave your hand, Penny. There she is.
cute, huh?
sort of a quiet, nerdy thing.
not my usual, but nice.
anyway...
she turned me on to this whole homeless thing, which is terrible.
and I realized... I'm not the only hero in the room tonight.
I'm not the only one who's fighting.
# It may not feel too classy #
# Begging just to eat #
# But you know who does that? #
# Lassie #
# And she always gets a treat #
# So you wonder what your part is #
# 'Cause you're homeless and depressed #
# But home is where the heart is #
# So your real home's in your chest #
# Everyone's a hero in their own way #
# Everyone's got villains they must face #
# They're not as cool as mine #
# But folks, you know it's fine to know your place #
# Everyone's a hero in their own way #
# In their own not-that-heroic way #
# So I thank my girlfriend, Penny #
Yeah, we totally had sex.
# She showed me there's so many different muscles I can flex #
# There's the deltoids of compassion #
# There's the abs of being kind #

# You've got to bash in minds #

one race, that's the only way. Some of us are trying to put together a past. 27 years ago, my parents were in this race, they never made it to the finish line. I know because I was waiting on the other side. Some of us are trying to escape a past. You were pissed out just as much as I do. No, man, I wanna hurt him, that's the difference. It's my one chance to keep my husband alive, you've been shipped back to Baghdad.
message DELETED - has anybody called? - no!
it's a chance of the way they live. - How long? - A year dad!
I'm fine honey. I got a bad cold coming on. It's my chance to protect my baby. Is there some reason going home doesn't feel safe to you? And I'll do anything, betray anyone, to win 32 million, but two ways. It's better than three ways. I can't believe I'm hearing this. Welcome to the race.
Rome GEORGIA. After sunset but before dark, good luck.
CHECKPOINT: ROME GEORGI. DEADLINE: 6:02 P. M. SUNDOWN
outside Gainesville, Florida 406 miles to checkpoit
okay, try it again.
okay, okay! Stop, stop!
I didn't say get out of the truck, I said stop.
I need you back in there.
we're never going to get out of Florida, are we?
I don't know.
does the secret cabal that runs this race have roadside assistance?
Tully, this next checkpoint is 400 miles into the next state.
I am aware of that.
and he said we had to make it before dark, which means either an elimination round or a penalty.
I don't even want to think about.
I thought you said. Getting there fast wasn't enough.
Yes.
but getting there at all is helpful.
shouldn't you be trying to figure out the clue?
he gave us a ticket with an address.
I think I figured it out. Go to this address.
Yeah, I'm going to need you back in the truck.
you want me to try it again? - No.
wow, dude, did you see who that was?
they're done, homes.
I knew that piece of crap they were driving wouldn't make it out of the state.
I'm surprised this one made it into state.
what?
what are you talking about, man? This car is primo, baby.
in a vintage car show, maybe.
but in a cross-country road race?
it's not exactly what you call fuel efficient.
not the sturdiest thing either.
and the upholstery's a little...
anyway, I say we get something a little faster,stronger, more contemporary.
I can have it waiting for us at the next stop.
how'd you manage that, daddy's money?
let's just say we have options.
let me tell you something about this car, homes.
I won it off of Tommy Guerrero, one of the meanest, toughest hombres on my block.
hombre? - And he got it from Eddie Ortiz, who was even meaner and tougher thanTommy.
it was left to Eddie by Rafe Castro, one of the original Latin kings.
you know what I'm saying?
the car had multiple criminal owners.
this car is royalty, homes.
it belonged to kings and princes. Got a history.
you think I'm just gonna let that go?
you can forget about it.
Plus, I'd rather walk cross country than drive some piece of crap daddy paid for.
I don't need nothing from that man.
that's why you were robbing our house?
that shows what you know, homes.
it wasn't robbery, it was burglary.
robbery's when you jack somebody, like, with a gun.
burglary, it's all about the property, baby.
Plus, you do way less time for burglary.
is that what you did time for?
no, man.
speeding.
dad, how are you feeling?
better. I think.
where are we?
Oh, about 50 miles south of the georgia border.
you sure you're okay?
kind freaked me out with that whole fainting episode back at Cape Canaveral.
I'm fine, I just need to pace myself better.
violet, you're doing 85?
Oh, I know, isn't it pathetic?
cute boy and his brother just basically blew our doors in.
every time I try to push this thing to 90, it shakes worse than you do when I talk about birth control.
you're going too fast, Vi. Slow down.
dad, we have almost 400 miles to Rome, and sunset is at 6: 02 P. M.
if I slow down, we're not going to make it.
well...
hands at ten and two, then.
you wanted roadside assistance. I think we just got some.
Hey. - Hey, folks.
having a little trouble, are you? - Yes, we sure are, officer.
I can radio for a mechanic if you like. - We'd appreciate that.
turn around. Get down on the ground now!
what? - Get down on the ground now!
what's the problem?! - Ma'am, stay right there. Do not move.
what are you doing? What are you doing?
are you arresting him?
I'll send a unit to pick you up, ma'am.
I'd advise you get in that truck.
aren't you going to read me my rights?
you don't have any rights.
what, is that a joke?
Yeah. Here's the punch line.
outside Valdosta , Georgia 304 miles to checkpoint
so, um, do you think your friends are going to be very angry?
I wouldn't really call them friends.
especially now that you shot out their tires.
right. Yeah.
I barely knew those guys.
I met them once back during Katrina.
Oh. Yeah. I noticed the, uh, the Louisiana plates.
Yeah, well, there was this hospital where Susan worked, and all these patients had to be carried to higher ground after the levees broke, so I helped.
that's how we met.
that's very dramatic.
we were on the news.
local heroes, yada, yada.
that's probably why they asked us to compete in this thing.
what about you?
me? No.
I've never been on the news.
tifton , Georgia 248 miles to cherkpoint
do you really think we're in the lead?
can't say for sure.
the only other racers I've seen were in our rearview a half hour ago.
the time we're making, car'd have to be on jet fuel to beat us.
first place. So what are we gonna buy with all our millions?!
anything you want.
a house on its own private island?
island? - Come on. Not a big island.
but, you know, just enough room for you and me and a half dozen people that are gonna be waiting on us hand and foot.
I like the way you think.
before you call that realtor, by, we got to hit the road.
we got to protect this lead.
all the way to the final finish line.
how far away do you think that's gonna be?
you got me.
feels like the army, you know. They never really give any details.
they just point you towards something, tell you to run like hell for it.
I'm going to get something to drink. You want anything?
just you back in a hurry.
sooner we get there, more time we'll have to celebrate.
that's right!
initial casualty reports indicate 16 American wounded and three killed.
as part of our ongoing series, america's war, today we profile one of the soldiers killed in last night's action:
Speclist Mike Bakka.
Mike Bakka was born on april 14, 1982 in Holland, Michigan.
as a baseball player in high school, Mike enlisted in june 2003...
yo, did you see that chick in the Stang, where she went?
maybe she got off.
Yeah, just by looking at me, huh?
Hey, you think this is a riddle?
admit one.
maybe when we get to where we're going, we'll have to admit something.
like you might have to say what you were in prison for.
Oh, I think they already know that, homes.
I'm pretty sure they're the ones who got me out.
Seriously? - Must've wanted me in this thing pretty bad.
someone recognized some talent, you know?
pulled some strings, bro. - Someone?
who someone? - No clue.
they just handed me the race phone when they kicked me loose.
it was in my stuff.
so what talent?
what were you locked up for?
would you believe me if I said I killed a guy?
no.
would you believe me if I said I was innocent?
no.
Yeah.
state of Maryland didn't think so either.
is that where you grew up?
no, man.
Miami. - What?
you're kidding. - No.
we were that close this whole time, we didn't even know about each other?
bro, I've known about you since the day you were born.
what?
I was seven.
I remember my moms came home, she told me I had a little brother.
then she told me I was never going to meet him.
then why'd she tell you? - Because...
she wanted us to go to church and pray for you.
I guess that worked out okay, huh?
pray for me? Why?
she was like that.
yo, I think I see that chick back there.
should I let her catch up?
we're in a race.
right, right, right, right. Way to stay focused, bro.
Thanks.
FLORIOA HIGHWAY PATROL
excuse me.
I'm looking for someone that was just brought in--Alex Tully.
he was arrested on the side of the I-75 about 40 minutes ago.
assaulted, actually. I was a witness.
you want to report an assault? - I want to get my friend.
he was brutally attacked by one of your officers while being taken into custody.
and now I want him released.
what was the officer's name?
I don't know, I wasn't looking at his name tag.
um, Powell or something.
could it have been Poole? - Yes. Poole.
I think so.
and the name of your friend? - Tully. Alex tully.
uh, stephanie, see if we got a tully back there in holding.
and find out where officer poole is.
Alex Tully. So I finally got a name to go with the face.
what?
Alex Tully of Hastings, Nebraska.
that a nice place, Alex? - It's okay.
you live there with the little woman, do ya?
or did ya?
up until this, I guess.
missing
what are you doing so far away from home, Alex?
you and that blonde out putting these up on telephone poles?
look... officer... Poole, I don't know who it is you think I am.
Oh, I-I know who you are.
you're Alex Tully of Hastings, Nebraska. We've established that.
and before we talk about what you're doing here in Gainesville, I want to focus on what you were doing in Ashland, Kentucky, on July 12, 2003.
I've never even been to Kentucky.
this is not a good way to begin, Alex Tully of Hastings, Nebraska.
this is not a way to build trust, not when we both know that you were in Ashland, Kentucky on July 12, 2003.
and we know this because I was there, too...
and I saw you.
maybe this will refresh your memory.
do you recognize them, Alex Tully of Hastings, Nebraska?
no.
well, you should.
those are the people you killed.
so where'd you say your brother'd gone to, Miss Tully?
I didn't say where he went.
neither did he.
then I don't suppose he said when he might be back, either.
look, detective, as I told you on the phone, I spoke to my brother a few days ago he asked me to look after things while he was away.
I agreed. That's all I know.
and you don't find that odd?
this whole thing is odd, detective.
it's odd that someone broke into this house and took my sister-in-law.
it's odd that you're here looking for Alex when you should be looking for Kathryn.
that's what I'm trying to do.
good.
we'd welcome the help. - So would I.
so, help me, mrs. Freeman.
help me to understand why it is everyone here is looking for your brother's missing wife, but he picks this time to leave town.
you'd have to ask him.
I intend to.
what are you saying?
none of this smells right.
how does it smell, detective?
smells like he's running.
july 12, 2003. Ashland, Kentucky.
the first national credit union was held up by four armed men.
I've never been to Kentucky.
I was with the Ashland PD at the time.
my partner and I were first responders.
there was a shoot out. All four men escaped. Three bodies were left behind...
I didn't kill those people.
Gloria Starns, there to cash her husband's disability check...
I run a landscaping business in Nebraska.
Scott Hemple, 24-year-old bank employee. - I've never killed anyone.
and Robert Cruz. my partner. - I didn't shoot your partner.
I didn't say you pulled the trigger.
you weren't in the bank.
see, the wheel man, he doesn't wear a mask.
he just sits outside while the job goes down.
but. According to the law, he's just as guilty as the guy who does pull the trigger.
that was you in that car. That was you.
you've got the wrong man.
you got any kids, Alex?
you and, uh...
katheryn here? You got kiddies?
not yet.
Bobby had three.
only one of them was old enough to understand what happened to her daddy.
the other two...
they won't even have a memory of their father, but I'll always have a memory of Bobby laying there. Spitting up blood.
scared, knowing that he was done.
and another face...
that face.
Alex Tully, of Hastings, Nebraska. The wheel man.
you're wrong.
I'm not wrong and we both know it.
and how long this day goes is up to you.
we're gonna be here until you come clean.
until you admit who you really are.
I don't understand, baby.
it doesn't sound like you were even friends with this...
what's his name? - Mike Bakka.
we weren't friends, but I knew him.
his unit and mine did dry-terrain survival training in the Mojave together.
but you told me you already knew a couple dozen guys who got hurt over there.
why are you so upset now?
Ellie, my outfit did two weeks with Bakka's unit in hundred-degree heat eating dust and bugs.
I knew all those guys, yesterday we had 16 hurt and three killed.
so... ? - So why haven't I heard anything?
huh? A unit gets hit like that and people get on the horn.
I haven't heard word one.
its, it's weird.
you know, something's screwed up.
now, gimme the phone. I gotta make some calls, please.
no. - What?
not when you're going 92 miles an hour, no sir.
Ellie, I can drive and talk on the phone.
that's what they all say. Next thing, they're hamburger.
no. Let's wait till we get to Rome. - Ellie, I'm not kidding.
look. We are in the lead.
we are winning this thing because we're focused.
let's stay that way, okay?
don't let anything else distract us. Please?
Ellie, I'm not gonna get distracted. Now gimme the damn phone.
Ellie, I'm not asking you.
so, what? You're ordering me? - That's right. Now give me the phone.
well, guess what? I'm not in a gosh darn army! - Hey!
get it yourself.
who is it? - Your mother.
you're supposed to be with her next weekend.
she probably wants to know when you're arriving.
I'll deal with it later. - Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it.
she doesn't really want me to come.
probably just calling with some bogus reason why I shouldn't.
now, Violet, that isn't true.
your mother loves her time with you.
dad, please. She is so happy in San Jose with Herbert and the nanobot twins.
think she really enjoys that reminder twice a month of the family she left behind?
Yes.
well, I mean, no.
that's not how she thinks about it. About you, anyway.
well, unless the finish line is in northern california, I can't go.
what am I gonna say? "Barbara, Violet can't visit because we're in a secret, illegal road race?
but don't worry, it's perfectly safe. The car only does 85.
I don't think so. - I know.
but I-I... I can't lie. - No, you got that right.
I'm glad you see it that way, honey.
cause that would be setting a terrible example to set for you.
no, dad, you can't lie because she'll see right through you.
you're like the worst liar in the world.
but you could be taught.
Tifton, Georgia 248 miles to checkpoint
I'm gonna get something to eat. You want anything?
no, I'm good. Pre-packaged only! Don't order nothing they gotta cook.
we're in, we're out.
Hey. Hi.
Wow. Hello there yellow bird.
that's what I was calling you out there on the road.
you know, to myself. In my mind.
cause of the way you were gliding along in that big car of yours.
all right. Okay.
so, uh, what's up? I'm winston.
Dupree. - Dupree. like that. It's a nice ride.
looks like you need some help, though.
Yeah. Um, something's wrong with her. Would you?
Yeah. Okay.
credit that to me for forcing her to keep up with a certain yellow bird.
you were trying to keep up, huh?
Yeah. It's a long drive and most of the scenery's pretty dull.
I like to have something pretty to look at.
well, Dupree, see what we got here.
coolant level looks all right.
when's the last time you checked the oil?
never.
how would I do that?
well, first you gotta find the... - dipstick?
think I just did. - What the...?
I'm apprehending you for failure to observe the terms of your Parole in the state of Maryland.
do not resist or I'll be forced to, you know, hurt you.
you a bounty hunter?
fugitive recovery agent, thanks.
Hey. What's going on?
sir, this is official business. Do not interfere.
she's a bounty hunter, bro. - Fugitive recovery agent.
she's saying i jumped parole. - Not me saying it.
it's the state of Maryland.
wait. - Stay back.
do what she says, man. It's all right. No sweat.
the keys are in the car. You get in and you drive.
you got till sundown, remember?
Hey. Sean? For what it's worth, man, I didn't do it.
do what?!
that one was his first love, before he met Katherine.
72 dodge challenger.
he raced professionally?
semi. But that was a lifetime ago.
a man doesn't keep photos of his first love on his mantle unless there's still something there.
there's not, trust me.
his wife make him give it up?
no. He had left that life long before he met Kathryn.
what life?
look, detective, I, I know how this looks to you.
it's your job to be suspicious, but he's out there right now looking for her. I know it.
Alex would never do anything to hurt Katherine.
she's the one who put him back together she made him Alex again.
so when your bother isn't alex, Mrs. Freeman, who is he really?
I'm Alex Tully.
I'm not a getaway driver.
I run a landscaping business in Nebraska.
Yeah, you keep saying that and I'm getting tired of hearing it.
I want the truth. - And I want a lawyer.
it's obvious you don't have any proof to back up your accusations.
you can't just keep me here. - Oh, but I'm not.
what?
I'm not keeping you here, Alex. How can I?
you're not here. Just like you weren't in Ashland, Kentucky in July of 2003.
you haven't been arrested. You haven't been booked, and nobody saw you coming through that front door.
so. Like I said. You're not here.
that's impossible.
I'm telling you, ma'am, there's nothing in the system.
no reports of anyone by the name of Alex Tully being taken into custody today.
well, he was. Where is officer Poole?
we're still looking. - He assaulted Mr. Tully very seriously.
could he have taken him to the hospital?
we're checking on that, too, but we woulda heard.
look, I need to find my friend.
we need to be on the road.
it is absolutely vital that we make it to Rome, Georgia, before it gets dark.
and associates. How can I help you?
this is Sean Salazar. Let me speak to Esteban Masferrer right away.
I'm sorry, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Masferrer is in west Palm all day in meetings.
would you like to leave a message?
Yes. Tell him I'm at a Preston's 40 miles north of the Georgia border.
tell him he has exactly 45 minutes to meet me here or there's gonna be a problem.
I'm sorry, all right? Now, come on.
not till I find that phone.
forget about the phone, we'll get a new one.
I'm not going anywhere till I got it in my hands.
we have to get back in the car.
rob, we're going to lose our lead.
our lead?
is that what matters to you?
we worked hard to get in the front.
I don't think that we should just throw that away!
is that all you really care about is this stupid race?
no. I care about us. More than you, I guess.
what's that supposed to mean?
you married me, but you love the army, your buddies in Iraq, your buddies on the base.
they're all you talk about! All you care about.
those men are my brothers!
where they're at right now you can't even imagine.
they're out there, they're getting shot at, they're getting blown up.
Yeah, I think about them, and I ain't gonna apologize for that.
and I love them!
and I ain't gonna apologize for that either.
great, Ellie. It's busted.
this whole thing, Ellie... this... this race.
this is just money!
I know. I got it in my head that if we won...
what? If we won, what?
that you would never have to go back.
and I know it's unrealistic.
and you would never turn your back on the guys in your unit.
that's why you're such a good man, and why I love you.
I just love you so much.
I don't...
I don't want you to die.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I know this is hard on you, too.
I promise you, it's going to be okay.
maybe we should find a pay phone so you can call.
we'll find one in Rome.
you certain about where you say your truck got stranded?
Yes. I am certain.
there's no truck.
what do you mean, there's no truck?
then it was towed. It wasn't running.
well, not towed by us.
maybe we'll get this all sorted out now. Here's officer Poole.
Jared, you pick up a motorist called "Alex Tully" today?
no.
outside Cecil, Georgia 271 miles to checkpoint a first-rate lie is detailed without being too detailed, you know?
it's close enough to the truth that you can remember it, but it's simple.
I'm concerned you've given this so much thought, dear.
okay, you know what? Let's try an exercise.
imagine you're a 16-year-old girl. - Okay.
okay. And there's this concert that you're, like, dying to go to, but it's on a school night so you know your dad won't let you go.
so what do you say to him so you will?
well, I'd start off by saying how important this concert is to me, and how much I...
No! No! Truth is death!
he will never let you go with that.
all right, you got to lie.
you got to lie like your life depends on it.
pretend I'm him, okay? So say, - "dad..." - dad...
I, uh... I have to... study... tonight...
in the library for A... test?
Yeah. You know, that would work...
if this were 1950, and I had just had a lobotomy-- try again.
well, what would you do?
all right, maybe if I gave you an example.
Oh, okay. Remember, last year, when I told you that Sophie Kramer had gotten dumped by that guy, and he also had given her an std, so she and I were going to check out that support group called teen girls considering celibacy in Eagle Rock?
that was a lie?
you didn't think so at the time.
you brought home literature from that meeting.
Yeah, cause it's all in the details.
I can't believe... what did you do that night?
dad, you're missing the point, okay?
the point is to examine the technique and make it your own.
go ahead and try one.
nice to be able tostretch our legs, huh?
Oh, let me. You've been doing all thdriving.
Oh, thank you.
want to run in and grab us some munchies?
okay. Okay.
uh... Wendy?
credit card?
sorry.
you want anything special or...?
just get a variety. - Okay.
Preston's "Your home on the highway."
you know, I actually worked in one of these when I first came to this country?
have you tried the pecan log? Surprisingly good.
boy, he's nothing like you. - I'm sorry?
just thinking about dad always calls you his other son.
and here it turns out he actually has another son.
my real brother. - Your half-brother.
how long have you known?
what am I saying?
you been cleaning up dad's crap for him ever since he put you through law school.
your father's a very generous man, Sean.
no one knows that better than your half-brother.
my half-brother has a name.
it's Winston. - Sean, let's go home.
your father would like very much to sit down with you, and your mother's frantic. She thought you might have been abducted.
I wasn't abducted, but my brother was.
right outside these doors.
he was taken away in handcuffs about an hour ago.
the parole situation in Maryland, I suspect.
no. You don't suspect. You know.
because the reason the bounty hunter found us on a georgia highway is that you tipped her off.
the situation your half-brother finds himself in is one of his own making.
neither I nor your father have put him there. - No. I did.
this is my fault.
it was the credit cards, right?
that's why dad didn't have you cancel them.
you were using them to track us.
I want him released, Esteban.
that's impossible. This is a criminal matter.
there's nothing I can do. - Bounty hunters aren't cops.
until she turns him over, he's still in play.
but if that happens, dad's lost a son.
and I don't mean Winston. I'm serious.
you'd cut off your own father for the sake of this half-brother you just met two days ago?
he must have worked quite a spell.
I want him released, Esteban.
you have 20 minutes to decide.
I'll be heading up north, waiting for your call.
guess you'll have to pick up the check.
a declaration of independence, Sean?
20 minutes.
the truth, Alex.
just tell the truth, and this can all be over.
you want me to confess to a felony. How does that make anything over?
well, the... the running will be over. The running from who you really are.
I told you who I really am.
all right.
maybe you just need a little time for quiet reflection.
so I want you to look at that man, hmm?
really look at him.
you figure out who it is, eh?
and, maybe, by the time I get back...
wait.
okay.
you want the truth? I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything.
truth is...
I can't stop running.
I got to keep going.
if I don't get out of this room, and to Rome, Georgia, before dark, there's every chance they're going to kill my wife.
I can't tell you why.
I can't even tell you who has her. I'm not even sure.
but that's the truth, and that's the only truth.
if I thought confessing to these crimes would help save her, I'd do it.
I would confess to anything.
but you have got to let me go.
well, it's about time! - What?
the only way you're going to save your wife is to win the race.
who are you? - No. That's...not... the... question.
the question is, who are you?
what is going on?
this pantywaist landscaper from Nebraska?
you really think he's got a shot?
no, Alex. No. This guy!
this is the guy that we want! This is the guy that you need to be again.
the road gets longer. The road gets harder.
there's going to be things required of you, things that this landscaper never even dreamed of!
and just driving fast is the least of it.
though you are gonna have to do that, too.
so I just got a selection.
some people are allergic to nuts.
we should probably write down what we're allergic to, you know, in case of...
what are you doing?
I'm making some room to stretch out.
this thing's taking up so much space.
put it back. - What?
that is Sam's car seat. Put it back.
Sam ain't here.
you need to put it back.
you really, really need to put it back.
and then you need to never touch it again, ever. Okay?
okay, yeah. No problem.
great.
I hope you like caramel.
mom?
okay, you can do it, dad.
barbara, how are you? Sorry to keep you in the dark.
I got a last-minute invitation to a conference in Seattle and decided to bring Vi with me.
we're driving past the Puget sound now.
you should see it--it's beautiful.
good detail, huh?
anyway, I was wondering if she could stay here with me next weekend, instead of coming up to San Jose.
we'll make it up next month, I promise.
Really? That's wonderful, barbara.
thanks so much.
John, I don't understand what you're saying.
I called because your work said you'd left town, and I wanted to make sure you had enough meds while you were traveling.
Yeah, the Space Needle. Right!
they're the only thing buying you time right now.
you've got to keep up with them, you understand?
right. Okay. No problem, Barbara.
John? - Call anytime.
dad, that was great!
I mean, honestly, even I couldn't tell that you were making that up.
well, I, uh...
I had a great teacher.
so this whole thing was a lie.
getting to a deeper truth.
who you really are.
I don't understand-- if somebody's telling me to go faster, this is a pretty strange way to do it-- pulling me off the road.
well, you were already off the road.
you were on the side of it.
so if this is about giving me a car, why not just give me the car?
why go to all this?
I needed to make that checkpoint before dark.
well, you still can.
old Alex Tully-- the real Alex Tully
he'd be there already.
Where's the girl? Where's Corinna?
you forget her-- she's only holding you back.
save one damsel at a time-- save your wife.
leave the other one to us.
Rome before dark, huh?
police escort couldn't hurt.
I ain't the police.
and this ain't my car. - What?
well, you did a good job, but...
it's not the same car. It's not mine.
it's the same car. Nope. If it were...
guess it is mine. Where's Corinna?
did you learn anything?
would the real Alex Tully waste time asking that question?
the real Alex Tully never left his partners behind.
and you don't want to meet the real Alex Tully. Promise.
now, where is she?
get in!
what's going on? - Buckle up.
I don't know who you got to, but he's big.
first time I had to throw one back.
one thing you should know:
I'm not the only one out there looking for you.
keep your eyes in the rearview.
good luck, guys.
you can thank me later. We got to go.
figure we got two hours to make it to rome.
you mind if I drive? I'm starting to like this car.
keys. - Come on, give me an hour.
keys. Or I'll take 'em from you.
okay. Whatever.
Rome, GEORGIA what happened back there? What did they do to you?
they didn't do it to me, they did it to some other guy.
Where'd you get this car? - Same guy's car. Hang on.
after SUNSET
welcome, drivers.
Congratulations--you have made it to the after sunset, but before dark.
we know you have questions.
for answers before you.
this is something... you're gonna wanna see.
this time, the young rookie took it to the veteran.
you did all right today, Joseph.
don't ask me to do that again.
Jimmy, after four lackluster performances, is Jimmy Bly back?
well, I hope so.
everyone falls down. It's just how fast you get up, right?
beau, the win could be called controversial.
well, a win is a win. - So you won't protest?
no, but I will have some lunch. Anyone wants to join me?
thank you.
enjoy. This won't happen again.
Jimmy, want to talk later?
if he wants to talk, he'll be talking to me, okay? Come on.
know how much you'll be worth if you win? They'll buy you in sections.
your eyes to a sunglass company, your arm to a watch company.
your foot to a shoe company. Or maybe you'd like to keep some parts.
come on, he just finished racing. - Hey, you're not here.
DeMille. - What?
what's so wrong with what she said?
nothing.
nothing.
what are you doing?
swimming. - Swimming?
that's swimming to you, huh? I don't think that's swimming.
that's a little beyond.
I've never seen anything like that.
pretty fantastic. Where'd you learn how to do that?
I was raised by frogs. - Raised by frogs?
well, I'm glad you escaped. - Oh, thank you.
Jimmy, what's on your mind?
how does Beau do it? - Do what?
stay on top. Stay focused.
he drives scared.
no, I don't think so. That guy is ice.
to you, he's ice. Inside he's scared.
but he likes it. He says it makes him try harder.
he says the day he's not afraid is the day he'll stop.
you're just as good. And the day you stop caring...
...what other people think and make yourself happy, you'll be even better.
come on.
don't you ever stop running, cold fish?
block me again and I'll put you into the wall.
well, that's not gonna happen again.
believe me.
what are you trying to prove? - Got nothing to prove.
no, you proved you could do very little with very much. Forget it.
why do I waste my time talking to this guy?
because no one else likes your arrogant ass.
so that's it. - That's it. Mystery solved.
while you're in this good mood, do yourself a favor.
what? - Take her back if she wants you.
stay out of my business, Joe. What are you doing?
I'm just talking. You do want her back, right?
why do you care?
you two have a lot of history. That doesn't go away so fast.
I pushed her away, Joe. - But you weren't thinking right.
I wasn't thinking at all.
you know, it's really hard when...
when I see her with him.
and I did it, you know?
it was me. I'm responsible for it.
you wanted to win no matter the cost.
you want me to talk to her? - No, Joe, don't do that.
you don't want either of us to talk to her?
that's just great.
Hey, Beau, if this is about pride, you better forget it.
that's how the whole thing started. - What would you do?
me? To get someone back that I really love?
get that rock out of my stomach? Crawl.
you'd crawl? - Crawl.
you never crawl. - I'd crawl till there's nothing left.
come on, champ. Use your head.
welcome to ESPN's coverage of the Twin Rings Race qualifying section.
and we're live from the Japan Motor Speedway in front of 120, 000 spectators today.
open wheel racing, a very popular sport in Japan.
one day to the event, and it's been a great day so far.
you should ask Jimmy how it is to have the best manager.
with the final run just completed, the top five best times were:
Brandenburg, Andretti, Gugelmin, Montoya and Fittipaldi.
an interesting sideline: This year's rookie point leader, Jimmy Bly...
...only managing a tie for 10th place.
relax, dude, don't shove. Hey, don't shove. We're friends.
Jimmy! Jimmy, why 10th today?
how come this never happens to me?
all right!
you seem preoccupied. - I'm thinking about Jimmy.
you know, Carl thinks he can't cut it. I think he can. It's just...
it's tough to get close to this kid. It is.
I think Carl cares more about helping you than helping Jimmy.
you're way off. - I can see in the way he looks at you.
I mean, with Jimmy it's business. With you, it's personal.
keep it steady, Jimmy. Keep your eyes out of the mirror.
with a steady drive, Beau Brandenburg has managed to catch up to Jimmy Bly.
the veteran working both sides, doing all he can to make Bly nervous.
don't let him intimidate you.
I don't know if I can do this.
you should talk less and drive more. - Looking great, Jimmy.
Brandenburg knows every inch of this racetrack.
he moves inside of Bly, lets him know he's there.
let's take him down.
now it looks like he's gonna try him on the outside.
they're neck and neck!
he gets by! Brandenburg is in the lead.
that's some incredible driving by Beau Brandenburg.
bly's teammate, Tanto, got Bly to the front of the pack earlier today.
Jimmy, don't let him get to you. Shake it off.
I'll get it back. I can get it back. - Stay on him.
now we'll see if Bly has learned through this season.
can he come back and regain the lead?
Bly will try it on the high side. - Don't overdrive the car.
the suspension's getting loose. - Bly is looking everywhere:
inside, outside, high, low, just nowhere to go.
don't overdrive the car.
the rear is drifting. Jimmy, keep it steady.
don't overdrive the car.
don't overdrive the car.
they're in the final lap. This is it. Final turn.
Bly still all over the place. He's coming up around, going high.
bly's in trouble! Bly's in serious trouble!
he's off to the gray stuff! Oh, he slams into the wall!
Oh, my God!
are you okay, Jimmy?
safety trucks are rolling. The crowd on its feet, silent.
we all await word on the fate of rookie driver, Jimmy Bly.
they pull him out from under the car. He gives the crowd a wave.
Jimmy Bly, after that awesome accident, is all right.
and the crowd responds to it.
what a waste.
it's my pleasure to welcome you to glimpse into the future...
...and the 1000 horsepower extreme machines that'll race us into the millennium.
kindly join me in welcoming the power and the glory.
well, Joe. Now what part of formal didn't you understand?
wait a minute.
Oh, my mistake, yeah. I'm gonna go get a drink.
you look very nice. - Thank you.
Hey, rebel. - Yeah.
what you got there?
it's something I want to give Jimmy later.
be selective who you spend time with.
extend yourself. These people make everything happen.
he's right. - You'll stay around, right?
I'll be around.
you do know your way around, don't you?
I like your brother. - I liked him first.
DeMille? - Nina. Exactly who I wanted to see.
you look fantastic. - Thank you.
earlier today you said that Jimmy has to find it off the track.
What'd you mean? - Here we go with the questions.
gotta find that quiet spot.
if your mind's not right, you will get torn apart.
so you better buckle up. It's gonna be a bumpy ride.
I can't believe that line still works.
now this is either very unprofessional, or naive...
...or she swallowed your bullshit and loved the taste.
Where's Memo? - Replacing you. Working his way down.
Joe, if you don't get it by midnight, you're probably not gonna get it.
and even if you do, I don't think it'll be worth it.
just an observation.
excuse me.
you make any new friends?
like these people want to talk to me. When the season's over...
what? - I was thinking...
...maybe we could go someplace. I've never even had a vacation.
never? - Never.
no pressure, all right? Just think about it.
two minutes, please?
what a coincidence.
is this a little experiment for you or something?
dark chapter you can tell your friends about?
maybe you like being man-handled.
that I can understand.
but it's the being dumped part that's kind of a drag.
so you were just used and abused?
was that attitude?
saucy. Good for you.
and next time I'm around, look at him. He ain't over it.
your mascara's running.
that's cute.
stupid bitch.
so, are you two enjoying the evening? - I'll wait over there.
if you win a championship, what would you do first?
I don't know, really.
you've had some peaks and valleys over the season.
what have you learned?
what have you learned that you never realized before?
that it's another world. - Where air is rare.
your team can take it all with a strong show in Germany.
how do you prepare for something like...?
there you have it, James Bly obviously very pensive about the upcoming race.
Yeah, well... - What's happening?
what's it look like? - Jimmy.
you came with me. - Maybe she'll leave with you...
...but what I have to say you don't need to hear.
just let him talk. It doesn't mean anything.
Yes, it does mean something. - What, Beau? What does it mean?
we should probably just go. Sophia, let's go.
don't do that. - Don't do what?
that's none of your business. - Come on. What's going on?
it's nothing, DeMille. - Back off.
come with me for a second. Can I talk to you?
you're doing this all wrong. - I know.
I do everything wrong.
excuse us. - I can't believe this is happening.
I don't want to spend more time away from you.
I miss you.
I miss you too.
Really? - Yeah.
do not go over there. Trust me. Jimmy, please. Calm down, calm down.
don't blow this. Not over her. This is not eighth-grade prom.
how you act, these things are important.
Jesus Christ! - He's giving her a ring.
that's not good. - Please take it back.
whatever it is, you can deal with it later. This is not the time.
just work with me on this.
Jimmy.
I'm so sorry.
go. Just go.
I don't...
let me explain it to you. - Hey, you need...
get away from me.
play somewhere else. - Just listen.
five minutes. - Go away!
Jimmy. - Don't push me, don't push me.
go. - Fine, fine, okay!
play your game somewhere else. - Get the hell away from me.
move, move, move! Move!
I need backup!
pull over!
come on, Jimmy, pull over!
get away from me, man. Just...
you want to go through me? Come on.
I want to fight him.
for what? - For what?
you weren't there?
what do you think he did, take your woman away?
why did I let him take her away?
she was gone. She was always gonna leave.
what do you know anyway?
your brother puts so much pressure on you...
...you looked for an edge. You figured she was it.
why do you act like you care?
I'm just a thing to you, part of the job.
you pick up a check to help me out since you didn't help yourself.
why does that make you better?
it doesn't. Why did you take the car?
I don't need to be pushed.
go on, say it. - Forget this.
you hoped this would get you thrown out. You're looking for the exit.
what are you talking about?
you don't know who you are anymore!
you think you've got to be perfect or you're a failure.
well, forget that. Just forget it.
I was gonna give this to you before all this went down.
impressive, isn't it?
what is it? - It's the first thing I ever won.
it was probably the last time I ever felt pure victory.
no pressure, nobody breathing down my back.
just driving because I loved it. Pure.
that's where you've gotta get back to. Doing it naturally, for you.
I don't have your gift, but I do have some things you don't have.
I got will and I got faith. Don't laugh, I'm serious.
I believe that you can will yourself into anything and do anything.
having faith, that's like believing in...
that's like having a good disease, it's contagious.
hang with people that have it, you're gonna catch it.
that'll change your attitude.
and winning is an attitude.
so if you trust me... No, if you trust yourself...
...By this season's end, you'll be on top or you won't.
but I guarantee you're gonna know what Jimmy Bly is made of.
outside Chicago, at the chicane it goes up...
...and comes down right where you got Brandenburg...
is that when I dip down?
forget it.
I'm tired of these spoons. We play with spoons.
say, "Ah." - Ah.
welcome to Germany. Home of beer...
...the Autobahn and Beau Brandenburg.
qualifying begins tomorrow. - With two races left...
...Beau is leading in the race for the world championship.
Jimmy Bly is in second.
commissioner Gilson has slapped Bly and teammate, Joe Tanto...with a $25, 000 fine...
...for their recent joyride through downtown Chicago.
doing great, Jimmy. Keep pushing that speed.
Hey.
you don't need to talk to me anymore?
it's not like that. - Really? What is it like?
all right, here you go. Jimmy.
three, two.
one. Beautiful. Come on, buddy.
now, is he a hero, or is it hype? What do you think?
what do you want me to say?
I want to hear what you think!
Jimmy just needs time to develop, that's all.
when he can get it together off the track, he will on it.
that's what I think.
like you got it together?
you can help the kid off the track more than on it.
you're not racing on Sunday. I'm bringing Memo back.
come here. Joseph, over here.
sit.
at my level.
it's the moment of truth, my friend.
if he doesn't deliver next time out, he goes.
don't hate me, but you go with him.
I'll come around here in Turn 7.
driving off Brandenburg, I'll fake outside.
eight's a tough place to pass.
I'm gonna carry that speed...
...bring it down the straightaway. I have plenty of speed.
kind of flawless.
you're not even paying attention. Watch this.
show me again.
Yes, sir.
if you find yourself in a position to hold up traffic, do it.
I don't want any front-running.
you know the drill.
don't hurt yourself. - I told you and I told you too.
what? - I told you I'll return.
here I am, returned.
like the real Zorro.
there's no helmet big enough to hold that head.
there's so much love in here.
you keep smiling, your face is gonna crack.
why shouldn't he smile? He's got a lot to be happy about.
he's back where he belongs. Right, baby?
Yep.
good?
Hey, you're so good.
you win this, yeah?
you're gonna win.
be safe, all right? - You too, be safe.
this is the second to last race of the season.
and what an exciting one it promises to be.
the crowds are here.
it looks like there's a thunderstorm maybe a mile from the track.
the rain threat hasn't dampened the spirits of this crowd here in Germany.
what do you want?
wanted to apologize.
apologize to yourself.
let's race.
I want you to stay in your world and don't get into his.
you push him hard. You get him thinking about you.
and you're not thinking about him.
got it.
the skies are opening up as the warm-up lap begins.
how's Jimmy?
he's all there.
we are racing in Germany.
beau Brandenburg is starting in the pole position today.
Jimmy Bly is in second.
Brandenburg moves out in front on a course you can race in the rain.
brake tires are on and they are at speed.
memo Moreno is back, giving Jimmy Bly help as his teammate.
I'm sure Memo wants to make his presence felt today.
boy, he is on the fly.
it's like he has something to prove.
good move, Memo.
keep it steady.
somebody wants their job back.
I think Joe Tanto may want to watch his back.
somebody's spinning!
Kenny Brack, he's in trouble.
he's gonna go way back in the field on that one.
back at the front, the battle continues.
look at Brandenburg. He cuts off Bly!
he tries to take me out. - Detach it. Hold your line.
ride his blind spot.
I will, Joe, but I can't see a damn thing.
neither can he. Just patience, my man. Patience.
take him, Jimmy! Take him!
Jimmy Bly in second place.
putting the pressure on Beau Brandenburg.
push it.
here we go.
Bly is gonna try to make a move in the corner...
...on Brandenburg on the outside. He does it!
Bly takes the lead.
goddamn brilliant.
car in trouble, spinning on the wet pavement.
looks like Gidley. - Oh, here comes Max Papis!
crash!
head on into that car! Max Papis is airborne.
if he takes it to the inside, don't follow him, he's setting you up.
in the hairpin, that fight for the lead continues.
Jimmy Bly has the lead now.
Brandenburg wants it back.
Brandenburg goes to the high side.
he gets by!
Brandenburg back to the lead.
keep going, he's putting on a show.
it's a hell of a show.
Yeah, hell of a show.
now Memo Moreno whips out of the pack and passes Andretti.
he's really trying to get up there with Brandenburg and Bly.
memo, what are you doing?
I can almost touch him.
hold your position.
Why? He's gonna win this.
I'm sure Carl Henry is not too happy with Moreno.
now Bly wants to make a move.
hold on, Memo. Moreno trying to make the same move on Jimmy Bly, his teammate.
memo, no passing. Do you hear me?
I'm right there, Carl.
lift off. Steady. What are you doing?
Moreno appears to have something to prove here.
he gets alongside Bly again.
damn it, we went over this!
lift off!
lift off! You work for me. I said, lift off.
why don't you let him drive? Come on, baby.
come on. Come on. Come on! - Shut up!
I've got to do this.
with his teammate in the battle for the championship...
...Moreno decided to stick his nose into this fight.
Hey, Memo, back off.
only inches separate these two cars.
memo, you're too close.
what's going on here? Bly is spinning.
he gets it under control. He's going backwards on the track.
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Jimmy, what the hell are you doing?
memo?
get out! Oh, God!
we're getting chopper pictures.
this is horrible. The car is upside down.
it's in a body of water. Moreno is pinned underwater.
it's okay, Memo. I'm here.
beau, Memo crashed. Jimmy went after him. You gotta help.
he went into the river at Turn 5.
I'll get you out, Memo. It's gonna be okay.
I'm on my way. - Beau, what are you gonna do?
please be careful.
Oh, God! My foot!
Oh, come on.
hang on, Memo! Hang on!
help me! - Get out!
help me! - Get out, now!
it's gonna blow up!
Hurry!
we've got Bly and Brandenburg to help a man in trouble.
rescue teams are on the way, but the remote location of this crash makes it difficult to reach them.
lift it up, higher. Lift it!
take a breath, Memo. Come on. We're here.
we're gonna get you out.
now!
come on. One, two...
get it over. Memo!
we got you, Memo.
come on, Memo. - I can't move my leg!
come on.
it's gonna be okay.
fuel everywhere.
they better get that driver out of there and themselves too.
that fuel could ignite, it could be floating on the water.
come on!
hurry up!
that is horrifying.
I've never seen anything like that.
it's unbelievable.
worried about the well-being of another driver, another competitor.
goes to show the kind of men they are, their true fabric.
but they worked as a team together.
Oh, my God, look at that! Are they okay?
it looks like they are. I think I see...
I see movement.
I can't move my legs. I can't move them.
Jimmy?
Jimmy? You all right?
it's just my foot.
you'll be fine. You'll come through this fine.
how's Memo? - Fine, they're looking after him.
our thoughts, of course, with Memo Moreno and his family at this point.
Hey, Memo.
Hey, Joe.
how do I look?
never looked better.
Jimmy? - Yeah?
Hey.
Thanks.
memo, I'm sorry. - You came back for me.
saved my life.
we race.
we take chances.
I took this chance.
so look at me.
look at me.
don't see you.
see me.
one who made a mistake.
that's all.
it wasn't a mistake.
how are you doing?
I'm all right.
all right if I come in?
Yeah.
you tried to get him out.
so did you.
you were there first.
I mean, he almost got you killed and you still tried.
anybody would've.
would they?
you're a good man, Jimmy.
I'm sorry, I didn't want to win the championship this way.
see you.
the old Joe Tanto had a couple of attributes you should hold on to.
wasn't long ago you would've said:
there but for the grace of God, it's not me.
quietly taking your place in the pack.
where is that guy?
where has he gone?
who cares?
I do.
I miss him.
you're the first to know I'm terminating the kid's contract.
Why? - I don't think he's the real deal.
I don't think he's mentally tough enough.
I don't think he's adult enough!
gets out of a car in a race.
saved a man's life. - I'm not here to debate!
I'm gonna go for Brandenburg. Next year.
what are you doing? - Whatever it takes to win.
his brother know? - He's brokering the deal.
don't do this. - It's done!
then undo it. - You suddenly care.
don't kill him off! - Don't kill him off?
I watched you kill yourself!
you had everything, and you threw it all away!
and I had to sit there and watch!
the slowest man in the fastest sport.
I wake up every morning, my legs are on fire.
I know I'm gonna have to sit in this chair for the rest of the day.
but if they gave me one more chance, I'd do it all over again.
it ain't gonna happen.
we are all damaged.
I've got an excuse.
you don't.
do you?
I want you to know that I know about you going out to Brandenburg.
where have you been?
meeting after meeting.
I've got a dinner right now.
catch you later?
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay.
hello.
Jimmy, it's Sophia.
is everything okay?
something I have to tell you.
what restaurant did you pick?
Nina, you're in great hands. You are going to love this place.
DeMille. - Jimmy.
what are you doing here? I'll just be a minute.
please don't walk away from me.
did you sell me out?
are you working for Brandenburg now?
we should take this inside.
why are you doing this to me?
wait a minute! Who sold out first?
I would never sell out my own brother.
when you stopped listening to me that's what you did.
I just tried something different.
for the first time I thought for myself.
was that wrong? - Shutting me out is different.
and I was with you all the way until you handed your mind over to that has-been. Who got you here?
who got all the glory? You couldn't book a plane ticket without me.
you left me, and let me tell you something:
there's no worse feeling getting someone...
...to the top only to have them drop you.
you did that, you.
ten years, Jimmy!
all a waste.
it was coming together. Why not wait a bit longer?
because I'm not your goddamn waiter.
I was your manager.
and I deserve better than that. I deserve much better!
now you're over, and I am not going down in flames with you, brother.
that's one trip you're taking alone.
welcome to the Grand Prix. It's a sunny day.
it's going to be a great race. After an eventful season...
...this comes down to championship time.
everything's set. Let's get this thing signed.
after the race it'll be a madhouse. What do you say?
let's hear what she says.
what's her idea?
her idea? What do you mean her idea?
how does it feel?
what? How does what feel?
to be used.
what, I didn't treat you with manners?
you're gonna blow this over that?
what, do you want to hit me? Would that make you feel better?
hurt? - A little.
didn't hurt.
call that a punch?
did you know?
know what? - Know about my brother?
Yeah, I knew.
you could've told me.
I hoped you could work things out.
he was right, you know.
never booked a plane ticket.
remember I said by the season's end you're gonna know what you're made of?
it's the end of the season.
it's up to you.
Carl, you have to let me race.
I can win.
any driver that can't get out of the car in five seconds can't run.
trying to prove you're better than I think?
Yeah.
time him.
ready?
go!
four seconds. - Great.
not bad.
now the vertical test.
Carl, don't push it.
the vertical test.
you jump up and down on the bad foot 10 times...
...to see if you can handle the pressure.
again, my rules.
don't glare, Joe.
makes your eyes look small.
it's all about commitment, right?
right. - Right.
all right, Jimmy. One.
two.
three.
four.
five. Come on.
six. Come on, Jimmy. Seven. Come on.
eight. Nine. Ten.
Yeah! - Good.
too bad you didn't try that hard sooner.
there are 100 laps...
...200 miles between this race and a champion.
Bye-bye, Daddy.
Bye, Lucas.
going into this race, Brandenburg was thinking...
...he was the winner of the championship.
he was four points ahead, and Bly looked out of the running.
we've just received word that Bly will be driving...
...which is amazing news after his injury he suffered in Germany.
so as it stands, if Jimmy Bly wins this race...
...he will become the new world champion.
so why'd you do it?
you helped me. I thought maybe I could help you.
well, I appreciate it. - It's okay.
don't go too fast.
take care. Appreciate you coming.
take care of yourself.
Jimmy Bly is a hero today, along with Joe Tanto and Beau Brandenburg...
...who all got to the scene of Memo Moreno's crash...
...which had his car in the water. He was about to drown.
they jumped in, got him out of the water...
...before a big explosion consumed the entire area.
you know that if I lose this race, I'm going to blame it on you.
that's what I'm here for.
I love you.
I love you too.
gentlemen! Start your engines!
let's look at the starting grid.
beau Brandenburg in the pole position.
Gidley will be following him.
Joe Tanto in the Nextel car starts 10th.
Bly is starting in the 26th pole position.
he didn't qualify today.
he's got 100 laps to catch Beau Brandenburg...
...if he wants to become world champion.
we're off to a good start here in Detroit.
Brandenburg's jumped out in front.
trouble!
Tanto's caught in traffic. He doesn't have anyplace to go!
ladies and gentlemen, we are under a yellow flag...
...until the cars can be removed.
Joe Tanto is in the pit with a broken front wing.
what's the story on Tanto?
tanto is out of it. Don't worry about him.
got it. That's too bad.
come on. Come on!
ladies and gentlemen, we have just one lap until green.
go, go, go!
a fast pit stop for the Nextel team, but this unfortunate mishap...
...is going to drop Tanto to last place...
...right behind his teammate, Jimmy Bly.
so, Jimmy, what do you think?
it's not looking too good.
we can work through this.
you think so?
I know we can if we stay tight and close.
okay. Let's do it.
green flag comes out again.
I'll take it right, you cut left.
look at this amazing teamwork between Bly and Tanto!
Hey, Joe, not bad for an old-timer.
that's it. Every man for himself.
Hey, not so fast.
who wants to be in front of the other?
what the hell are you two doing?
back off, back off.
don't be afraid of me.
why would I be afraid of you?
Carl, let Joe race his race.
Thanks, kid. I appreciate that.
let's split them at the turn. I'll take the inside.
they split around another car!
as they battle, it brings both cars forward.
pass me on the left, Jimmy.
way to go.
tanto and Bly are double-teaming the entire field.
what an incredible display of driving!
come on, don't stop now. - Stopping? Who's stopping?
we are now halfway to the checkered flag.
okay, Joe. Try to keep up.
still back there, Joe?
I'm still here. - I'm impressed.
Bly passes and Tanto is following suit.
with just 20 laps to go, Jimmy Bly has just moved into seventh place...
...and teammate, Joe Tanto, is in sixth.
everybody's off the pace.
but Bly and Tanto are coming on strong.
Brandenburg still leads.
in second place is Alex Barron. Barron has an engine go!
two cars swerving to miss the oil!
car up over the wall! Several cars involved!
here comes Jimmy Bly. He closes on the accident.
Bly has nowhere to go.
Bly and Tanto find themselves in second and third...
...behind Beau Brandenburg.
the drivers will take advantage of this full-course caution...
...and enter the pits for the last time this season.
Brandenburg, Bly and Tanto all are completing very fast pit stops.
now, with 10 laps to go, Beau Brandenburg is in first place...
...Jimmy Bly is in second, and Joe Tanto is in third place.
the world championship comes down to these last 10 laps.
Jimmy, show them what you're made of, kid.
okay, Joe.
green flag!
we're back to racing!
it's a sprint to the finish and championship.
Bly is right on Brandenburg's tail. He wants that championship.
take him now. Make your move.
he comes alongside Brandenburg. Brandenburg cuts him off!
Bly is gonna try it again.
he cuts and ducks inside! Bly has the lead!
Jimmy Bly has just taken the lead.
Bly gets past Brandenburg. He's in the lead.
great driving by Bly.
Brandenburg won't let Bly get away that easily.
I'll pull him back in. There's time.
Brandenburg is putting pressure on Bly.
don't overreach, kid.
just four laps to go and you are the world champion.
he's losing it.
come on, Jimmy!
Bly may be in trouble. He weaves back and forth.
Brandenburg is right there, ready to get past him.
and Brandenburg goes to the lead!
nice while it lasted.
Bly loses the lead with three laps to go.
he tried.
this is something we've seen this young rookie do so many times.
Carl Henry has got to be disappointed.
what is he doing? - Jesus.
he's back.
now, Joe Tanto making a move. He comes up alongside Jimmy Bly.
he passes him! Tanto to second.
they're shoving and elbowing each other.
Brandenburg, Tanto, Bly. One, two, three.
we've got one lap to go.
let's do it.
Joe Tanto has taken the lead!
unbelievable.
it's incredible. I can't believe it.
but problems with Tanto's car!
Tanto's in trouble.
will it hold together?
no, not for long.
hang on, Joe. - Stay in there.
what's he doing? He ought to park it but he stays in front!
I can't hold it together! Take it, Jimmy!
they split him!
he's lifting off!
I see that. He had it!
tanto has removed himself from the race, leaving Brandenburg and Bly.
neck and neck down the homestretch, battling for the world championship.
Jimmy, just drive because you love it. Drive for pure victory.
he's humming.
thanks for going, Jimmy.
pure victory. You're right there.
suddenly, Jimmy Bly seems to have a renewed vigor.
you'll buckle! Back it down!
Tanto's suspension has broken. He's now spinning.
but the battle is up front for the flag!
here it comes. Right down to the finish.
Bly takes it! - Bly wins the world championship!
beau Brandenburg finishes second, and Joe Tanto finishes third.
following Brandenburg, spinning across the finish for third place.
I'll say, the Hummer has taught us something here today in Detroit.
they're gonna kill me.
Joseph.
you could've won that race, right? - I did win.
Thanks.
Hey, you were incredible.
I know. I lost because of her.
this year's champion, Jimmy Bly!
Luc! Glad you stuck around.
you were really something out there.
beau Brandenburg!
go on, you're missing your celebration.
don't you go anywhere.
come on, go!
and finally, our third finisher...
...Joe Tanto!
Jimmy! Jimmy, you did it, man.
thanks for everything.
you owe your brother too. Whatever button he pushed got you going.
listen, enjoy this. It doesn't last long.

every passing minute witnesses billions being spent all over the world to counter terrorism.
and with each of these passing moments terrorists make a new plan to do something far more dreadful.
maybe in some other part of the world precisely at this moment in time.

nobody comes to know of anything when terrorists lose everyday.
however, any of those days, when they happen to win.
the loss to the human life is immense.
nobody knows how many officers work day and night to turn their victories into defeat.
we have intelligence information that the terrorists are planning something heinous seven days from now on the 10th which will kill at least twenty five thousand people.
when? Where? How?
we don't know anything.
they have plans, network and the targets.
and all that we have is seven days.

the car that you see in front is the same car which is said to have a bomb.
the entire Anti Terrorist Cell is present here.
and it is hoped that they would be able to bring this grave situation under control.
that's good, we will be free.
Shashank. - What?
he won't let the bomb explode!
don't look back.
Ragvan. - Sir.
check if someone is spying on us from the building. - Right sir.
sir, you are right. There indeed are some people on rooftop.
they are the ones spying on us.
Aditi, Ragvan, Pawar, come with me.
Shashank and Roy, you cover us from this building.
and Shashank, shoot only when absolutely needed. - Sir.
who the hell smokes on duty here?
Roy, let's move.
nobody will come from outside. Understood?
we have been deceived again. - Why so?
the bombs we diffused during our training had their wires in either red or green.
all the wires here are white, my friend.
figure something out.
Yes, l will. You know that.
babe, I love you too.
hands up.
Aditi, caught on the west wing sir.
how many people?
four. Two of yours and two of mine.
we'll see. - l still don't have a shot, Aditi.
two for you, two for me, isn't it?
what?
opc 16 has diffused the bomb in the car.
there was a gun fight in the nearby building resulting in a terrorist's arrest.
when we were standing there, there was a big blast in the parking lot behind.
after that. - Excuse me, madam. Please, out.
l will keep you informed.
hello. Come in.
home Minister's office
dg Bose. - Good afternoon
dg Sinha.
the home minister must be arriving but you may carry on. l will brief him.
sir, we have been working on a person for the last eight months of whom we don't have any records.
he controls all those who spread terrorist activities in our country.
sir. He enjoys support from three countries.
many of the people from our department work for him.
one of his men has been arrested.
we will get information about him very soon.
the bomb blast today morning was his handiwork.
and we have concrete information that a week from now, for the 10th May, he is hatching such a conspiracy which will result in a loss of twenty odd thousand people.
how? - We don't know that, sir.
who is this man? - We don't know that too.
his photo, his sketch? - No, sir.
what do you know about him?
l know his name, sir.
you can't handle a couple of blasts in Delhi and trying to teach international politics to me?
we are answerable to the government.
sir.
Hello, Siddhant. - Hello.
you wished for a meeting? He is Mr. Raidu, the lndustries Minister and he is DlG Siddhant.
Yes, l know. l saw your interview on TV in the morning.
very good.
Mr. Raidu. Please come.
sir, l have spoken to them. They say that the bomb blast which took place today is the handiwork of some big terrorist. - Hello.
he is on with the investigations.
shall l stop him?
l will tell you what to do after that.
lt was Swami-ji. There is a press conference in some time.
they are demanding to close down the ATC.
what are you talking, Mr. Raidu? - ln Hindi. ln your language.
lf Swami-ji has said so, we will have to comply.
this is not the way. Let me speak to him.
l cannot close something down like this.
swamiji has 40 MPs. Better think what you want to do.
want to run the government or the ATC?
l'll come. - Okay.
what do you think?
why do these people want the ATC to close down?
you are crossing the line.
what was the name you mentioned?
Yes. Jambwal.
don't ever mention it again. Never to anyone.
who knows who would turn into your enemy!
there is much more than what meets the eye.
lf you can't close your eyes at least learn to keep your mouth shut. - Yes, sir.
got it!

how did they know that our man is in the opposite building.
lf our man is amidst them, someone from theirs must be in among us too. You know!.
l don't know about 'inside' but there is someone on the periphery, for sure.
anti Terrorist Cell
good morning, sir. Here is a fax from the home ministry.
what do you know about Jambwal? What is he going to do on the 10th?
heard that something catastrophic will happen this time.
nothing like that will happen, Altaf. You will tell us everything.
your wife and children are in Sultanpur.
ln the past tense.
lt is Jambwal's principle to destroy the weaknesses of the ones who are caught.
our job doesn't let us make friends.
nor does your job let you do that.
after working honestly for twenty five years, we get a fax to close down this department.
one fax. No space for discussions even. lt's an order.
what have l earned in these twenty five years?
forget a friend. l don't even have a person who would ask me what my wish is.
you are in the same situation.
you risked your life and now your people want you to swallow this and end your life. What have you earned, Altaf?
nothing.
why don't we become friends? While l oblige you, you reciprocate by obliging me.
we already share a bond of enmity, don't we?
and l have played my part to perfection.
one more will do!
Yeah, going on! Yes. l will keep you posted.
Altaf's file.
okay. Bye.
Altaf is a goner today! Sir is in a horrible mood today.
his mood is going to ruin our night.
keep watching. The meeting will last a long time.
l don't know what you see in him.
even l don't understand that. But he has style.
sir. that fax. - Which fax?
they say that the ATC will be closed down in a week?
not in a week. ln seven days.
and the whole world can turn upside down in seven days.
the whole world can turn upside down in seven days, huh!
Hello?
all DCs in the conference room. Right away.
come on.
okay, is everyone ready? lt's gonna be a long night.
shall we order for dinner? - Chinese.
Shashank. Chinese. - Sorry, sir.
sorry sir.
please come. - This is my place.
eight months ago, l had appointed an agent in Bulgaria.
her name is Neha. l just received a call from Neha and she told me that one of Jambwal's close aide Himmat Mehendi, who handles Jambwal's finances has been arrested. He was drunk and driving.
now, listen to me carefully.
Shashank, and Aditya, both of you will go there.
and as soon as Himmat is released, you will kidnap and take him to the place recommended by Neha.
and then, make him talk about Jambwal's whereabouts and his plans for the 10th.
but there is a problem.
we cannot make this mission an official one.
lf you are caught in this mission, neither do l know you nor do you know me.
lt all depends on what we can do in the next seven days.
either this.
or this.
all the best, boys.
Siddhant, how can Shashank go? His sister is being engaged tomorrow.
the engagement is in the morning. The flight is in the night.
l was going to become a pilot. Don't know how l got stuck here.
lt is good. At least you will die alone here.
don't know how many innocent people you would have risked there.
you are funny. - Yes.
let's rock, boys. - Let's rock, sir.
Banff Police Station Canada l have spoken to them. They will release you by Monday.
call up as soon as you are released.

the heart will be filled with a feeling of loneliness.
my eyes express your feelings.
when the heart dearly misses someone!
there she is.
who's that girl?
who's that girl?
the lips deceive the heart.
we beat around the bush.
moments when one can express the heartfelt are very rare.
this isn't something new in love.
the gaze looks for her all the time.
and the heart is lost.
the moment her image appears to fade.
there she is, in person!
there she is, in person!

lf we take the left, we will reach the airport.

Hello?

Hey, Shashank. You can drive if you want to.
aditya. - Yes? - Your bag.
of course, l was about to get it.
can't really understand why people smoke.
those who don't can never understand it.
Yes, and the ones who do, don't survive to tell the tale.
those who tolerate you everyday can't be harmed by a mere cigarette.
can you hear anything?
Yes, your stupidity, so shut up.
there is something behind this stupidity.
lncrease the speed.
decrease it. lncrease.
Shashank, we are jacked, this car has a bomb in it.
Oh, you are funny. - Not this time.
seriously.
don't reduce the speed. Let me check in the rear.
l was wondering whether you would come or not.
even l was indecisive since morning whether l should come or not.
thanks for coming.
okay, you didn't bring your car?
no. l felt if you'd come, l'd convince you to come with me.
l thought that we would return together.
l didn't find the bomb here. Bonnet.
your boot. doesn't it close?
sometimes. l have to get it checked.
what do l do? You told me not to reduce the speed.
no.
see, how they are driving.
stop the car. - She is telling me.
see, how they are driving. They will bloody kill someone.
they are crazy.
you aren't alone. You are with your wife.
there are other policemen in this city.
bloody stupid.
stop the car.
l said, stop the car.
Shashank. The bomb is in front.
now who is this after us?
tell him that there is a bomb here. He will take a U turn.
make that crazy man understand.
stop the car.
look. Look at the way they are driving.
you will not change.
the person who didn't change after killing his child what is he supposed to change now?
please, stop it.
there is a restaurant ahead.
one cheese burger please!
l didn't kill my Kabir. l didn't kill my Kabir.
Shashank, my braveheart. Even policemen don't chase like this.
bomb! Shashank, where is the rear view mirror?
how handsome.
don't remove your foot from the accelerator.
Hello, darling. So you are hiding here.
don't apply the brakes. Or else, brother will have to attend Anu's marriage all alone.
was it diffused? - No.
Shashank. private number.
hello.
your friend drives excellently. But why does he always remain angry?
good question. Couldn't be known till today.
but you are going to find that out pretty soon.
Shashank. Private number.
the first car was fixed. This time she is going to blow us up.
l already had my eyes closed.
l have been working on this case for the past eight months.
now it is all yours.
just checking if you can handle it. Test!
you have passed.
how far is the Downtown police station from the city?
we have to reach there before eleven.
no. We will go home first.
Yes, we just have to change. Bathing is already over.
please, l am feeling cold.
headquaters
busy?
you seem to be quite hassled.
someone from us is with them.
l made this family with such love. And one of us?
suspect someone?
everyone.
me too?
Yes, you too.
they have Anu and Jay.
what have you decided?
something.
tell me if you need me.
come on. l will tell you the time. - Where are you taking me?
why are you taking me in the car? - We will tell you everything.
where are you taking me? Where are you taking this car?
what are you doing? Who are you?
look carefully. You don't know us. Himmat Mehendi.
Himmat Mehendi? Who is Himmat Mehendi.
see, you are mistaken. My name is JD.
Shashank, he says that he is JD. The same as that of a whiskey?
see, try to understand. My name is not Himmat Mehendi.
my name is JD. lf you don't believe it come with me to the police station.
l have been released just five minutes ago. What is the time now?
the car that you were in day before yesterday met with an accident.
Himmat Mehendi. You have two options.
agree, without resistance or agree, after being bashed.
take your hands off my collar. Take your hands off my collar.
how the hell did you grab my collar?
one thing is sure. The person who followed us in the morning was a policeman. - How do you know that?
he is still following us. - Shit.
let's go out of the city.
out with your hands behind your back. Quick.
who are you guys? - See, sir. We are.
we haven't said anything as yet.
your face says that you are going to lie.
shall we tell the truth then?
why are you hitting him?
tell us what you want to hear.
OK, where were you going with car number 3310, today morning?
where were you supposed to reach?
l lost my wife because of you. - Because of me?
Yes. She was returning after one year.
whom is he talking about?
who is he? - He is our friend.
l am not their friend. They have hit me a lot.
and this fair guy, he had hit me real hard.
what is he saying? - Listen to me.
shut up!
he is lying, not me. Listen to me.
just listen to me. - Quiet.
gunshot! Hey he is falling over me.
move.
come on. Let's go.
who are these people?
whoever they are, they are very angry. - He is a goner.
let's take him inside.
are you crazy? lf we take him inside, we will land up inside.
he is a policeman.
then we will do what policemen should do.
let's rock.
to the left.
what happened?
point 38 bullet and a man.
look at me. There is blood on my shirt.
and these people don't believe that.
agree that you are Himmat Mehendi. There isn't any way out.
how does she know that my name is Himmat Mehendi?
come on inside. l will tell you. - ls there place to sit there?
why did you bring him here?
had l not done so, he would have brought in many along.
and l didn't feel like leaving him there.
you have a heart?
l do, till now.
name.
you said what my name is.
age.
l am forty four years old.
but my parents have recorded two years less on the passport.
they are illiterate, you know.
what are you doing here, Himmat?
you brought me here, and now you are asking me what l am doing?
what are you doing here in Canada?
l was called to Canada.
who called you to Canada? - You know that.
very funny. For what?
l don't know that.
what is happening on the 10th?
what is happening?
there isn't any festival even.
what is Jambwal going to do?
no one can ever know about Jambwal's activities.
what will you tell him?
everything. - What? - l will tell him everything.
he is a police man. - That's why.
he can harm you.
he won't. - How do you know?
some faces make you feel you can relate to them.
and do these relationships work?
sometimes, they do work.
drink. Here.
what do you do for Jambwal?
l teach the moves.
the movements of the pawns.
their international movements.
there are Dollars, Dinars, Pounds! Black, white and blue money.
green buckes, our money, their money, l talk about money.
l play with money. With Jambwal's money.
the source of Jambwal's money when it should be seen and when it should remain hidden, everything.
and nothing is out in the open. Everything is here inside.
no one can peep inside, right?
this is what l do for Jambwal.
so, you are the money behind that madness.
l am mere money, sir. Rather the world is mad.
a small man comes from Punjab here, to Canada.
he does small things, small amount of money laundering.
a little bit of here and there.
one day, he gets a huge amount, to take from lraq to America.
he carries it. He later finds out three hundred sixty people murdered.
that man is scared.
he thinks that he will never work with Jambwal after this.
but Jambwal never listens to anyone's refusal.
he kidnaps him from home. Then he does what Jambwal says.
and he will continue doing it till such time Jambwal asks him to do.
look.
you two lndian soldiers. And this little lady.
Jambwal will crush you while you chant your national anthem.
Jambwal is watching everything. And he never forgives.
lt isn't late even now. There is still time.
lt would have been late. But it won't be late now.
you guys are under arrest. l have heard everything.
put it down, inspector. No account for bullets is kept on the mission that we are on.
thousands of bullets have returned unsuccessful in the past 17 years.
we don't aim false.
but l shoot the first bullet.
we can talk.
of course. But after lowering the guns.
because even if a single bullet is shot whoever loses their life, you will be the ones dead.
down.
according to our intelligence, a dangerous criminal, Jambwal, has planned something lethal and catastrophic for the 10th of this month.
we are here to investigate it. And this is the only man who can help us.
so, right now, l would need you to cooperate with me, officer.
and we don't have much time.
officer.
okay.
l will help you.
and.
thank you. For saving my life, guys.
but we will not live here. We will live in my house.
and where is his house?
AIIMS FLYOVER l don't dare to believe anyone in the office.
l haven't called a colleague today, but the one whom l love.
today l am going to do something in which anything can happen to me, to our family. lf anything happens to me, take care of everyone.
you are the eldest.
what is going to happen on the 10th?
Dan's HOUSE
give me my bottle.
please, one more.
give him, please. - Nonsense.
what is going to happen on the 10th?
only Jambwal knows the entire plan.
we just know our parts.
the sitar knows which chord to play.
the drum knows its rhythm.
and the strings know of its notes.
and then, there are trumpets somewhere far away.
and just near Jambwal, lie a few drums.
then Jambwal raises his hands. And there is music.
go away from here now.
what to tell you?
how does he look?
don't ask this question.
the one who comes to know this doesn't survive.
how does he look?
he is tall. He walks like a lion.
he has curly hair.
and his smile is like small children. Very cute.
l don't know about his eyes. Nobody has seen into them.
they say there is death in them.
his brother was recognized by the police.
everyone was worried as to what will happen.
but, only Jambwal had the answer.
what else do you know about him?
l have already said what l knew. Don't try to know more.
please go and think about your family.
my wife isn't going to come back. Never.
and as far as my son is concerned, l have killed him.
what will you kill him?
what will you kill my son?
headquarters
sir, shall l make the entry?
okay, sir.
you may hide it from your people. How will you hide it from my people?
you close my eyes, and you can't see yourself?
should we say it one last time?
one cannot live fully without embracing suicide and crime.
say it.
a pact made with relentless fire that requires that some live, others die.
on three.
one...
...two...
...three!
each of us has within us a weak aspect, eager to give up freedom to be dominated.
...
but we also have a will that desires freedom, that insists on deciding for ourselves, each of us individually...
...what is good, and what is evil.
are there any questions?
doesn't anyone want to challenge Justin's thesis?
do you all submit to this Darwinian struggle of egos?
l got a question.
Mr. Haywood, you're awake!
let's hear it.
what's a dork like you know about power?
what would an ass like you know about philosophy?
keep it civil.
are you talking about crime?
you should wake up more often.
what about it? - All freedom risks crime.
freedom is crime. lt thinks of itself and not of the group.
thank you, Justin. Very daring. - Thank you.
for those of you interested in the source of his report, take a look at Nietzsche.
you really need to get laid, Bonaparte.
Hey, Justin.
remember me? - What do you want?
l want to blow your brains out.
and l'll make it look like a suicide.
everyone would believe that you killed yourself.
you won't get away with it.
your shoe prints are unique. They'd be traced back to you.
the fibers on your shirt are all over me.
your hair too.
lt's called transference.
more importantly, your fingerprints on my neck, where you touched me.
you can't get them off skin. - You can with a Magna-Brush or a fingerprint cam or an iodine gun and silver transfer sheets.
you don't have the discipline to commit a murder.
ls that right?
let's see.
bang!
you're dead.
what took you so long? l've been waiting.
no, l have something better.
what is it? - Absinthe. Wormwood-infused alcohol.
the molecular structure is almost identical to tetrahedral chlorine.
tetra what?
the active ingredient in marijuana.
where did you get it?
poets drank it for inspiration.
lt's been illegal since the turn of the century.
even better to the systematic derangement of our senses.
forget the senses.
let's derange the world.
we will.
when?
soon.
what about tonight?
what about right now? - l have a biology.
fuck your biology!
you always have excuses.
let's forget it.
we've been planning this for months.
l'm sick of planning. That's all it is with you.
lt's talk and plans and dreams. You're a jerk-off.
so jerk off.
Richard, wait.
just be patient.
here comes The Hyena.
why can't l go inside the perimeter?
l told them not to let anybody in.
lt's your first homicide. l didn't want you stepping on your tongue.
take this.
what is it? - lmportant tool. Hey, boys!
snack time! Set up a staging area.
this place will be crawling with people, including our chief.
rod? - Yeah, Rod is not a cop.
Darnell, get out of my crime scene! Come on!
sorry, Cassie.
there's only one way into a crime scene.
put your foot where mine goes and nowhere else.
ready?
ever do this in vice?
no.
right there.
looks like some kind of boot.
what's that smell like?
smells like vomit.
that's what l thought. Bag some for the lab.
what's the matter? - Nothing.
notice the hemorrhaging? - She was strangled.
Finger-shaped marks around the neck.
look at this.
clean cut.
trophy? - That'd be my guess.
defensive wounds.
she put up a fight.
good for you.
this is a secondary crime scene. Why?
this wound would produce lots of blood. There's very little here.
what about these?
Piquerism. - Pre or postmortem?
post, no blood.
not bad, vice.
probably aced your detective's exam.
the wind is picking up, we'll lose evidence.
hold on to everything we find.
any idea who she is? - No. No car, no l. D.
Jane Doe.
Hey, Bonaparte.
what's the matter?
miss Mills?
time's up. Put your pens down.
exchange your test with a neighbor.
number 20 is C...
l suppose you find it funny.
what?
me flunking a pop quiz.
you didn't flunk. You got 19 out of 20.
please pass the tests forward.
wait up, l want to talk to you.
why did you do that? - l have motives.
like what?
l need your help for my physics midterm.
why me?
because you're a genius, okay?
l live at 1108 Chandler.
can you remember that? Around 5?
Hi, Lisa.
this friend-- - Turn right.
lt's right here. - A houseboat. Neat.
neat indeed.
l like it out here. Not too many people.
Thanks. See you tomorrow.
you gonna see me to the door? - Of course.
you made detective in four years?
must be smarter than you look. -Thank you.
lt'll only get worse, l warn you.
you been talking to the boys? - l heard a few things.
they tell you why l was called The Hyena?
Why? - Female hyenas have a mock penis.
draw your own conclusions. - Does that bother you?
l just wear loose slacks. lt's really not a problem.
see you later.
no prints. The killer must have worn gloves.
so it's not a husband or boyfriend. - Why?
you don't use gloves to kill your wife.
unless you've thought about it.
missing ring finger. Ritual? Serial killer?
maybe a comment on matrimony. - A negative one.
maybe we should investigate every bad marriage in the county.
why don't you get on that? - Let's start with you.
ever been married? - Nope.
what's this?
an old murder case l was involved in.
the guy's up for parole, they want me to testify.
what do we have on Jane Doe?
l'm checking missing persons nationwide.
run her prints, have an artist do a sketch.
l got it.
Bonaparte! l didn't think you'd show. Come in.
who did these? They're quite good.
thank you.
you did them? - Don't look so surprised.
l modeled for them too.
bonaparte, you're blushing.
why do you call me that?
ever take a career aptitude test?
no.
lf you ever did, they'd recommend you a career as a dictator.
Why?
who would listen to me?
Where's your physics book?
you're overfeeding that thing. lt'll get as fat as you are.
l hope this is better than that other stuff.
lt's KGB.
for $400, it better put me on the moon.
you'll be totally satisfied, l guarantee it.
money back?
come on, can't we cut a deal?
you don't want it? - l want it.
l hate it when you call me that. - lt's a deal.
bring me a couple pigtailed cheerleaders, then l give it to you free.
how can l trust that? - l love this part.
can l just get the product already?
check this out.
come on-- - You'll get it. Hang on.
listen to her. She loves it.
we got our Jane Doe.
her name was Olivia Lake. She missed three days of work.
her supervisor found the place like this.
what do we know about the supervisor?
married, two kids, solid alibi.
maybe she caught somebody in the middle of a 459, and he panicked?
and what, took the body with him?
where did these mud prints come from?
there's a planting bed out here.
looks dry as a bone.
maybe she watered the lawn.
we got a time of death?
based on stomach content, between 9 and 10 Thursday night.
how about 9: 27?
can we come in?
let the games begin.
new assistant D. A. and former member of our department.
nice to meet you. Miss Mayweather, always a pleasure.
heard you finally passed the bar. Did they make it true or false?
she hasn't lost her sting.
what are you doing here? - Staying informed.
Really? Sam, please keep him informed.
thank you.
what do we got here?
sorry.
can l have you sign off? - Okay.
Sam, it's me. l'll be a little late. Why don't you get started?
looks like a body dump.
Jesus, she's alive!
nice detective work.
how'd you find me?
rule one: Talk to the neighbors.
you said a little late, and it's been three hours.
this about that D. A. Swanson?
that asshole? No.
he seemed okay. - Yeah, well, try dating him.
he got rough with me, so l broke his nose with a cat.
a cat?
well, a ceramic cat.
no, thanks.
good. Then you can walk me home. - Sure.
thank you.
sit down.
l should get going.
what's the rush?
can l ask you a personal question?
l can hardly wait.
how did you get into this work? Why homicide?
someone l knew was murdered, and l got interested.
Really? - No.
l'm just bullshitting you.
lt's just the kind of crap people like to hear.
wait.
what are you doing?
lt's called sex. lt's fun, you should try it.
we gotta work together. This is a bad idea.
don't worry, l won't get possessive.
wait.
why are you doing this? - Because l want to.
what about what l want?
what do you want?
right now? - Yeah.
this.
wait. Slow down.
no, no, leave that on. Just that. Please.
sure.
what's the matter?
you gotta get up, you gotta go. - Why?
because l gotta get some sleep.
can we sleep together? - Bed's too small.
no, it's not. - Come on, you gotta go.
Jesus!
l'll see you tomorrow. Good night.
the evidence is so tiny, you wouldn't recognize it.
a few red and yellow carpet fibers, some hair.
that's it.
the fibers will be tested to find generic and subgeneric classes...
...then compared to a database for the manufacturer.
fibers consistent with a mass-produced variety, made in Denver.
distributed in the United States under several names.
no help. - Same with the red fibers.
several trilobal nylon fibers along with other fibers will be matched with a brand.
lt's sold by Hanover Sampson for several discount stores.
that narrows it down.
they sold 50, 000 in that color last year.
examination of the cuticle, cortex and medulla of the hair will reveal them to be human.
two brown human hairs. Definitely not the victim's.
all but one.
at first, it will baffle them.
one hair of nonhuman origin, scale matches Cynocephalus maimon.
lt's a freaking baboon hair.
no fingerprints, no murder weapon. They have their work cut out for them.
that's what they're paid for.
coroner said strangulation was slow. Perhaps the victim was being tortured.
the postmortem stab wounds barely broke the surface.
okay, that's it.
they'll decide that, given the sloppy nature of the crime scene...
...the postmortem mutilation...
...the profile will be that of a disorganized offender.
poor social skills.
nocturnal by nature.
probably into pornography.
intelligent, but uneducated.
lives alone, few relations with women.
attack was spontaneous.
unplanned.
he didn't drive down close to the dump spot. That is planning.
but he left the footprints.
no evidence will lead to the suspect, but they'll damn him.
when will they have a suspect? - They're eating out of our hands.
poor Ray. He'll never see it coming.
Cassie, look at this.
Vigi boots. What the hell are Vigi boots?
there he is, in the black coat.
don't let him charm you too much.
Cassie Mayweather, Sam Kennedy, police. Can we talk to you?
Yeah, sure.
you're willing to speak without an attorney?
sure.
where were you last Thursday night?
what is this about? - Answer the question.
l was cramming for this calculus midterm. l was with a study group.
how long? - From about 7 until 3 Friday morning.
that's quite a cram session. - Yeah, well...
l got kind of a spotty record, and l gotta keep my grades up for college.
can you give us the names of the other people there?
sure. Am l in some kind of trouble?
you seem very particular about your appearance.
Thanks.
l like your outfit too.
she looks good. lt's, like, feminine...
...but it still manages to be professional.
ls that like a pleather?
we're interested in your shoes.
let's talk about these.
Vigis? - You own a pair of these?
you bought them at Scarlatti's, downtown Santa Barbara, for $637. 50 on your platinum bankcard.
size 12D.
this can't be about my shoes.
why not?
this is about my shoes?
you got me freaked out like l did something.
did you find them or what?
l reported them stolen three weeks ago.
l even filed a report with the front office.
did you find the shoes or not?
l think you should tell me what's going on.
because l'm spinning out here.
shoe prints matching these were found at a murder scene last week.
the Covington woman? - That's right.
you think the person who stole my shoes committed this murder?
l'll cooperate in any way l can.
any idea who stole your boots?
no, l don't. l wish l did now, though.
any enemies at school? - Well, it's high school.
what does that mean?
not to sound arrogant, but there are people who envy me.
Really? - Yeah.
why would they do that?
well, let's just say that l'm very fortunate and that l've been blessed in many ways.
must be nice being you, Richard. - l got no complaints.
lt all checked out. He filed a report about the boots.
and made a big fuss to the principal.
Yeah, l bet he was a pain in the ass.
she didn't say that. - No, believe me. l hate kids like that.
like what?
what about the study session?
six kids were at his house with him from 7 or 7: 30 Thursday evening, till 3 a. m. Friday. l talked to all of them.
he was there except for 15 minutes...
...he went to an ATM to get cash for a pizza.
did you check that out? - Yeah, he withdrew $40 at 9: 19.
get that enhanced.
Why? - Because l can't see his face.
lt's him.
l can't see his face.
you really think he's involved? - l don't know.
but something's not right with that kid.
fifteen minutes. lt doesn't give him enough time.
he has to drive to Covington, kill her, dump her body, get back.
he'd need at least an hour.
they questioned me. - And?
lt was so cool! - Did they go for the shoes?
they grabbed it. l was so good. l really was. Listen.
this can't be about my shoes.
why not? - Did you find them?
you sure they didn't suspect anything? You didn't overdo it?
a little bit. l overdid it a little bit.
you think the person who stole my shoes committed this murder?
I want you to know I'm gonna cooperate in any way I can.
meet me at the bluff tonight.
l can't.
why not? - l have something to do.
like what? - l'll tell you later. l should...
know who his father is? - l wanna search his house.
lawrence Haywood. He built the mall.
big campaign contributor? - That's right.
and l won't fuck with that guy on this.
l've grown much too fond of my own ass to do anything that goddamned stupid!
and what is your problem?
where are you on this, Sam?
l don't care who his father is. - l don't mean that.
do you think we have enough to go after him?
no. And if we go in too soon, we could burn the whole case.
Really? And why is that, vice?
no judge would sign a warrant based on what you have.
shut up, Swanson!
this kid with his attitude-- -Attitude isn't a crime.
lt's an indicator-- - But he doesn't fit the profile.
the profile doesn't fit!
the killer was smart. He didn't drive to the site, he used Richard's boots...
...but the attack was unplanned? - But if we push too soon.
whose case is this? - Just calm down.
no, l've been trying to find Olivia's killer, busting my ass.
who's Olivia? - The victim.
ls this still my case? - lt's a coordinated effort!
you're getting way too involved in this, Cassie.
Cassie! - What?
you called her by her first name. - What?
you said, " l've been trying to find Olivia's killer. "
no, l didn't.
did l?
you're supposed to be identifying with the killer, not the victim.
remember that?
you don't have any witnesses or fingerprints or powder burns...
I almost forgot.
tobias always kept a gun, right here. Loaded.
can l come in?
listen, l'm sorry l didn't back you up in there.
l'm a big girl. You said what you thought, right?
Yes, but-- - Then you did the right thing.
we can't just bust in there-- - l know. l heard you.
so can you get out of the way? - Know what your problem is?
Yeah, you're blocking Matlock. Out of the way. Please.
l'm trying to apologize here.
all right, apology accepted.
you want to sit down?
you want to have a cookie?
Hi. - Hi.
what's going on? - We're making up.
we're still friends, right? - What's this?
l don't know, let's find out.
we do this and you throw me out again? - Or you stay. Or you leave.
l don't know. lt's hard to tell in advance.
what do you want? You want promises? You want a ring?
ls that what you want? A ring? - Don't!
look, it's not just about sex, okay? l really respect you as a person.
ls that what you--?
why do you always want to hurt people?
l wouldn't say always. lt kind of happens sometimes.
you're so good at breaking other people down but you never stop and look at yourself.
where are you taking me? - No peeking, we're almost there.
step up.
okay.
open your eyes.
my God, Justin, this is beautiful!
did you grow these?
what happened? You're different.
Yeah, l am different.
collect call from an inmate in a corrections facility.
the name of the inmate is... - Carl Hudson.
if you wish to accept, press
l do not wish to accept any calls-- - Cassie?
what? - It's Sam.
Hi, l'm sorry. What can l do for you?
remember the puke at the body dump? - Yeah.
most of it was unidentifiable...
...but Kevin managed to isolate some partially digested eggs.
fish eggs. - Caviar?
apparently so. I've compiled a list of the local vendors selling caviar.
what was his name? - Richard Haywood.
miles Haywood's kid? He came in once around Christmas.
not last week? Thursday?
l rarely see any high-school kids here.
except Justin Pendleton. - Who?
he used to come with his father, but his parents split.
now he comes in alone. He's a senior at Jefferson.
Richard's a senior at Jefferson. Justin eats alone?
he always brings a book. He's a bit of a loner.
but a brilliant kid, you should hear him talk.
when was he in here last?
the 5th. 7: 30 p. m.
what time did he leave? - About 9.
do you know what he ate?
Cassie Mayweather, with the San Benito Police.
you're a police officer? - l'm a homicide investigator.
can l ask you a couple questions? - Sure.
you had dinner at Maison Saint Croix on the 5th?
Maison Saint Croix. -Thank you.
the 5th was a Thursday, and they had a caviar appetizer. Did you have it?
Yeah, l might have. Can you tell me what happened?
do you know Richard Haywood? - Everyone knows him.
ls he involved in this?
ls he a friend of yours? - No.
l mean, l tutored him for his bio SATlast year, but we're not...
we don't have much in common.
are you in his study group? -No. What study group?
when you left the restaurant, did you take leftovers?
you didn't give your friends at the study group leftovers?
look, l told you, l barely know him. He makes fun of me in class.
why would he do that? - Because he's like that. He makes fun of everyone.
he's one of the cool kids.
what makes him cool?
you know, he's smart, he's rich, he's witty, and everyone likes him.
and you don't.
Yeah, l knew kids like that. Superstars of high school.
five years from now, nobody will care who they are.
well, Richard will always be cool.
his daddy's rich and l hate to admit it, but he's actually smart.
he's lazy and didn't study, but he got a 710 on that bio SAT.
lt kind of spun me out. - Spinning out, huh?
you seem to know him well.
you can tell by his behavior in class.
sorry.
Cassie, where have you been? Sam I. D.'d the suspect.
who is it? - Ask Sam. He's in charge of the case.
s. I.D. is over there now collecting evidence.
Hi, Cass. - Hi.
look at this, sir.
could be a match. - Log that.
l want samples of fabrics, soils, any molds, plants in here and outside.
John's found a stash of marijuana buds.
you mind if we smoke up while we work? - Yes, l do.
so who is he? - Raymond Lee Feathers.
he's a janitor at Jefferson.
l compiled a list of everyone who might have stolen Richard's boots.
then l cross-indexed that against carpet purchases and up came this.
apparently he sold grass to the kids at school.
good work. - Thank you.
where is he?
l don't know. Seems like he took off.
did you run him for priors? - A couple DUls, one pot bust.
but he hasn't shown up for work since the day we talked to Richard there.
did you find the boots?
not yet, but we may have a match on the yellow carpet fibers.
we've nothing on the vehicle fibers till we find his car...
...but he's got a stash of porno films, mostly bondage, just like the profile.
what?
he's not a neatness freak. - What are you saying?
sloppy enough to leave footprints, but smart enough to steal shoes in advance?
this is our guy, no question. - You find any caviar jars?
come on, wait a minute.
you're ticked that l got him, aren't you?
no. lf you got him, l'm happy for you.
after we close this case, maybe we should look for different partners.
might be better.
whatever you want.
good.
nice work, guys. - l gotta take a piss.
don't worry, l won't contaminate any evidence.
she pees standing up, that one. - Al.
don't talk about her like that, please.
you've slept with her already?
what? - You will. That's Cassie's m. o.
she lets you get close, then pushes you away.
ask her what's wrong, she picks a fight. You're working with her, because no one else will.
looks like a body dump.
now we know where that baboon hair came from.
lt's okay.
Hey, Lisa.
you want a ride? - We already did that.
that's not what l'm talking about. l want to talk to you.
want me to beg? Please. - You'll get in an accident.
please. l don't care.
you make me sad. Come on.
come on. lt's fun in here.
Hello, Justin.
how you doing?
what are you--?
what are you doing here?
you stood me up for that slut? - Lisa? She's not a slut.
did you tell her anything about us? - Of course not.
of course not. - You fuck her?
l was helping her with her physics. -You fucked her, and l saw you.
we kissed.
you kissed. - That was it, l swear.
Oh, Justin.
you helped Lisa, and you didn't even get laid?
what a schmuck. - She's not like that.
bullshit. She spreads like peanut butter.
you'd be surprised what a girl without a dad will do for male attention.
do you hate me?
I had to do it.
I don't want to hurt you, but I had to show you what she's really like.
she's not good enough for you.
she doesn't appreciate you. She's like your mom, dad and everyone else.
l'm the only person who really cares about you.
l think l'm the only person who sees how incredible you really are.
don't go away, Justin. Come on. What we did together, how many people have done that?
we proved something to each other.
we showed what we're capable of.
there's no limits for men like us.
did you hear about Ray?
they're onto him.
just one last thing to do and we're home free, right?
do we have to?
you tell me.
do we have to?
you got him! You got him!
I only ever met one man I wouldn't wanna fight.
I can't stop that.
get out of here, you useIess tit.
when I met him, he was already the best cut man in the business.
can you stop it?
started training and managing in the '60s, but he never lost his gift.
no.
let me have a Iook at him.
he's fine. He's fine.
he ain't if you don't stop this bIeeding.
I'II give you one more round.
seconds out. Let's go. - What do we do? Tell me what to do.
you Iet him hit you.
sometimes there's just nothing you can do.
cut's too wide, too close to the bone.
maybe you got a severed vein, or you just can't get the coagulant deep enough
come on! - Break. Break.
there are all kinds of combinations you come up against...
...down in the different layers of meat...
...and Frankie knew how to work every one.
that's it! Come on! - What are you doing?
knock him out, WiIIie!
people love violence.
they'll slow down at a car wreck to check for bodies.
same people claim to love boxing.
they got no idea what it is.
boxing is about respect.
getting it for yourself and taking it away from the other guy.
I'II warm up the car.
Mr. Dunn?
I owe you money?
no, sir.
I know your mama?
don't rightIy know, sir.
then what is it you want? - I was on the undercard.
I won my fight too. Maggie FitzgeraId.
weII, Maggie FitzgeraId, what's up?
did you happen to see it? - Nope.
I did pretty good.
thought you might be interested in training me.
I don't train girIs.
maybe you shouId. PeopIe see me fight say I'm pretty tough.
GirIie, tough ain't enough.
it's a mistake.
car shouId be abIe to back up, Frankie.
just push, wiII you?
what did Hogan want? - Offered us a titIe shot.
about time.
I turned him down fIat.
two or three more fights, you'II be ready.
been two or three more fights for a Iong time now, Frankie.
look, WiIIie, you get one shot at the titIe.
you Iose it, it may not come around again.
now, two or three more fights and we'II be ready.
whatever you say, Frankie.
Frankie liked to say that boxing is an unnatural act...
...that everything in boxing is backwards.
sometimes...
...best way to deliver a punch is step back.
weII, do your best, Lord...
...protect Katy.
Annie too.
other than that...
...you know what I want, there's no use me repeating myseIf.
but step back too far, you ain't fighting at all.
Bye. -Bye.
father, that was a great sermon. Made me weep.
what's confusing you this week?
Oh, it's the same oId one-God-three-God thing.
Frankie, most peopIe figure out by kindergarten it's about faith.
is it sort of Iike Snap, CrackIe and Pop aII roIIed up in one big box?
you're standing outside my church comparing God to Rice Krispies?
the onIy reason you come to Mass is to wind me up.
it won't happen this morning. - I'm confused.
no, you aren't. -Yes, I am.
then here's your answer: There's one God.
anything eIse? Because I'm busy.
what about the HoIy Ghost? - He's an expression of God's Iove.
and Jesus? - Son of God. Don't pIay stupid.
what is he then? Does that make him a demigod?
there are no demigods, you fucking pagan!
did you write your daughter? - AbsoIuteIy.
now you're Iying to a priest.
you know what? Take a day off, don't come to Mass tomorrow.
some people would say the most important thing a fighter can have is heart.
Frankie would say, " Show me a fighter who's nothing but heart and I'll show you a man waiting for a beating."
think I only ever met one fighter who was all heart.
my name's Dangerous DiIIard Fighting FIippo Bam-Bam Barch...
...out of Broward County, Texas!
danger showed up a couple of years back.
he'd come visiting L. A. with Ervel, his mama's new boyfriend.
apparently Ervel got lost and ended up back in Texas.
danger looked for him for about a week before he introduced himself.
Hey, you know, I gots nothing against niggers.
weII, that's nice to hear.
Yeah, Iots of peopIe where I comes from does...
...but my mama taught me not to cause hurt to no man...
...niggers or not.
you got a nice mama. Anything eIse I can do for you?
just one of those questions you ask...
...but Danger wanted to give it his best answer.
weII, sir, I'd Iikes to become the welterweight champion of the worId.
and I chaIIenge the Motor City Cobra...
...Thomas " Hit Man " Hearns...
...to fight me for the weIterweight championship of the whoIe worId!
yo, FIip, shut up, man! You ain't even ranked.
you gotta have at Ieast one fight to be ranked.
Hey, I'II fight any man, anytime!
Hey, you a bad man, huh?
get in the ring. Go a round with me.
shawreiie. -I wiII.
leave him aIone.
danger, you go on back to training.
wiII do, Mr. Scrap.
them's some nice tights, Danger.
I'II give you that ass-whupping Iater, OIive OyI.
Hey, bro, those pants Iook reaI pretty on you.
give his mama back her tights.
Shawrelle Berry had a left hook that would move a tank...
...but he had a heart the size of a split pea.
Frankie bought the Hit Pit from Bobby Malone 1 7 years ago.
Bobby wanted to move to Florida, and Frankie wanted some security.
Bobby died while he was packing.
and Frankie found out most gyms lose money.
I thought I toId you I didn't want Danger working out here anymore.
he ain't hurting nothing, Frankie.
weII, he's hurting me.
breaking my heart, watching him punch the air Iike he thinks it's gonna punch back.
and how many times have I gotta teII you that bIeach is bIeach?
why can't you buy the cheap stuff? You don't have to buy the expensive stuff.
it smeIIs better, Frankie.
bieach smeIIs Iike bIeach.
Hey, Scrap. - Hey, Mr. WiIIie.
Hey, nice fight Iast night.
nice fight.
big WiIIie. - Hey, SaIIy.
nice fight. - Thanks, man.
peopIe are taIking.
what the heII kind of Ianguage is that?
what do you want?
I thought you might Iike to know you got a fighter out there...
...not taIking to another manager.
not taIking to another manager?
and not just any manager.
Mickey Mack.
you came in here to teII me that Big WiIIie is not taIking to Mickey Mack.
not a word. Neither one of them.
I'm trying to read here.
weII, if you think that's more important.
who's your new girI?
what?
Jesus Christ.
better hurry up.
she keeps hitting it Iike that, she gonna break her wrists.
you're wasting your time. I toId you I don't train girIs.
thought you might change your mind.
dozens of trainers train girIs. You won't have any troubIe finding one.
don't hardIy need a dozen, boss. You'II do fine.
don't caII me boss, now. I'm not your boss, and don't you be caIIing me that.
WiIIie, you ready to work? - Anytime.
if I stop caIIing you boss, wiII you train me?
no.
then I might as weII keep caIIing you it.
she came from southwestern Missouri...
...the hills outside the scratch-ass Ozark town of Theodosia...
...set in the cedars and oak trees somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.
she grew up knowing one thing: She was trash.
it's for my dog.
she'd come 1 800 miles, but Theodosia was still just over the hill.
working the bag, boss.
I'm not your boss. And that bag's working you.
give her her money back.
you sure?
how much did she pay? -Six months.
Jesus Christ. - No, I'II give it back.
no, don't be a smartass now, wiII you?
woman thinks I'II throw away six months' worth of dues...
...just to get rid of her, she's out of her mind.
but just don't encourage her, understand? -Okay.
and what's Danger doing out there? What's he Iooking at?
looks Iike a bottIe of water.
he paid his dues?
dues? Boy can't afford pants. Want him to pay dues?
get out of my office.
fuck me.
can't think of it as a bag.
I'm not a trainer, but I can show you this if you'd Iike.
appreciate any heIp I can get.
what you wanna do is, you wanna think of it as a man, see?
and he's constantIy moving.
he's moving towards you, around you, away from you. AII right?
don't hit him when he's coming towards you because he's just gonna push you back...
...he's gonna smother your punches and take your baIance, right?
so you watch him reaI carefuIIy.
keep rotating. That keeps your head moving.
and keep one shouIder back so you're aIways ready to fire a power shot.
right? Go ahead, now. Good, good. Keep rotating, keep moving. That's it.
good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.
come on around. Keep moving, keep moving.
good, good, good. - Like that?
Yeah. Give it a few shots.
tuck that chin in, now. Tuck that chin in.
Yeah, that's good. That's good.
now, you get this down, we'II put you on the speed bag.
you do have a speed bag.
I'II just borrow it tiII I can buy my own.
aII right, you go on home now.
I'II waIk out with you? - No, I am home.
wanna see? - Yeah.
it's nice.
wouId it bother you if I worked a IittIe Ionger?
no, just puII the door cIosed when you Ieave.
thank you.
if there's magic in boxing...
...It's the magic of fighting battles beyond endurance...
...beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys and detached retinas.
it's the magic of risking everything for a dream that nobody sees but you.
okay, okay, feIIas, watch the footwork.
Hey, that's it. That's it.
hands up.
jab, jab, jab.
Hey, FIip.
Hey, FIippy, come here, man.
I think I found somebody you can beat.
I don't fights women.
why not, bro? It's perfect, bro, because you know why?
because she-- Like, you, you couId fight to him...
...and then you couId kiss to him.
then you fight to him one more time.
that's beautifuI, man. That's Iike poetry.
it's Iike poetry. - You been reading and shit.
Thanks, bro. -That's a girI, man?
FIip, I think you right. Look at her IittIe bitty titties. They're Iike mosquito bites.
man, that's bareIy even a mouthfuI. Let me see.
saw your Iast fight, ShawreIIe.
spent so much time face down, I thought the canvas had titties.
canvas has titties. Hey, Iook at me. I'm ShawreIIe.
just humping the canvas. Humping the fIoor.
come on, bro. The fIoor having titties? That's funny, bro.
shut up, man. What you Iaughing at?
man, hoId the bag, stupid.
some titties right there, man.
yo, when they start making those tights for men, FIippy?
punk.
aII right, that's enough. That's enough for the day.
I'II give you a rubdown. - Oh, I can't, Frankie.
middie one's got a piano Iesson. I toId Grace I'd drive her.
something wrong with Gracie's car? - She hates that car.
wants the oId one back, but the deaIer said he's aIready got a buyer.
maybe I shouId taIk to the deaIer.
I'd appreciate that.
okay.
Thanks. -See you Iater.
the man's a rubdown whore. Today he doesn't want one.
you ever do any work around here?
not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.
littie girI seems to be coming aIong.
Yeah. It's aImost Iike someone's been heIping her.
she might just be a naturaI. Looks Iike she's got something.
she's got my speed bag, that's what she's got.
I wonder how the heII she got that.
I wonder.
I'm gonna need that speed bag back.
this bag? -Yes, that bag. That's my bag.
and if you're hitting it, peopIe wiII think I'm training you.
is that such a bad thing, boss?
Yes. Yes, it is.
every time you touch it, you're Iosing me business out here.
I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myseIf. -Yeah.
weII, I can't just Iend it to anybody, you know.
I understand.
Yeah.
look, you seem Iike a nice girI.
can I give you some advice? - I'd appreciate that.
you'II find a trainer in this gym or somewhere eIse...
...that's gonna wanna train a girI.
it's the Iatest freak show out there.
the troubIe is, they're gonna be wasting your time...
...because you're too oId.
I don't feeI that oId.
weII, neither do I, but you don't see me fighting 21 -year-oIds, do you?
takes about four years to train a fighter.
how oId are you?
thirty-one untiI my next birthday. - Oh, weII, there you go.
you wouIdn't start training to be a baIIerina at 31 , wouId you?
aIready been working it for three years.
and you can't hit a speed bag? What kind of training is that?
never had any, boss.
weII, I hate to say it, but it shows.
somebody's gotta be honest with you.
I hate to be the one to teII you the truth.
Yeah.
weII, sorry for using your bag, Mr. Dunn.
you're not gonna cry now, are you? - No, sir.
Yeah.
here.
keep the goddamn thing. - No, you need it.
no, take the bag.
I haven't seen it in 20 years anyway.
I've had three since then. Just enjoy it, wiII you?
I'II just borrow it tiII I buy my own. - Yeah.
just don't Iose it.
Yeah, I know, Hogan...
...your guy's the champ, so we don't spIit 50s...
...but if I don't see 40 percent
look, you caII me back when it's 60-40 or don't caII me back at aII.
Hey, WiIIie. - Hey, Frankie.
something wrong?
I'm sorry to come by your house Iike this. I know you don't Iike peopIe dropping in.
Oh, you're not peopIe, WiIIie. You're weIcome anytime. Come on in.
I wanted to thank you for getting Gracie's car back.
Oh, weII, you don't have to thank me.
paying an extra thousand doIIars for your own car ain't exactIy a favor.
Gracie cried when she saw it.
ReaIIy?
I aIso needed to taIk with you about business.
Oh, yeah, weII, I just got off the phone with Hogan. We're aII set for September.
everything but the spIit.
I gotta Ieave you, Frankie.
what?
WiIIie, the titIe's just two fights away.
it ain't that, it's-- It's Iike you said, I got one shot.
if I win, I gotta make as much as I can whiIe I can.
I need somebody in the action who can make things happen.
and I gotta make the change before the fight.
onIy way this guy say he'd take me is if he took me to the titIe.
so I get you the titIe fight, and this guy takes you there?
onIy way he'd do it.
I'm sorry, Frankie. I know how Iong you waiting on a titIe.
I wish it couId've been with me.
Mickey Mack's a businessman. He can't teach you nothing.
you aIready taught me everything I need to know.
there's some things people just don't want to hear.
and I chaIIenge the Motor City Cobra, Thomas " Hit Man " Hearns...
...to fight me for the weIterweight championship of the whoIe worId.
danger, I'm wearing these mitts for a reason.
just working on my footwork, Mr. Scrap.
danger, you throw a punch or get the heII out of this gym.
danger, whiIe you thinking about that punch, I'II be right back.
I'm thinking how I'm gonna hit it hard for you, Mr. Scrap.
no one had the heart to tell Danger that Hearns retired years ago.
I heard about WiIIie.
that's coId. That's dead coId.
of course, it wouIdn't be so bad if you weren't so damn oId.
Yeah, weII, at Ieast I can see through both eyes.
didn't do you a Iot of good though, did it?
weII, I've got the gym.
don't need to be training fighters at my age.
WiIIie teII you why?
it was Mickey. Mickey's got the connections.
Oh, it ain't about connections. It's about you not beIieving in him.
weII, I found him, I stuck with him for eight years.
how's that for not beIieving in him?
you couId've got him a titIe fight two years ago. HeII, he knew that.
I'm amazed he stayed around this Iong.
weII, getting there and taking home the beIt are two different things.
what was I supposed to do, just put him in over his head?
not protect him?
Oh, you were protecting him from the championship.
Yeah. - WeII, now it makes sense.
weII, what about you, Scrap? What did your manager do?
you were a heII of a fighter, better than WiIIie.
he get you a titIe fight, or did he just bust you out...
...banging your head against other peopIe's fists untiI you Iost your eye?
I had my shot.
I went out swinging, and no man can say I didn't.
Yeah, weII, I remember.
and excuse me if I didn't want my fighter spending the second haIf of his Iife...
...cIeaning up other peopIe's spit. -Yeah, right.
right, you're the smart one. You're the one Iearning Greek.
it's GaeIic.
weII, you just protected yourseIf out of a championship fight.
how do you say that in GaeIic?
sorry.
Thanks.
the action continues as the champ is battling Big Willie Jones...
...and commanding him with rights and lefts.
up against the ropes, he's hitting him with the left...
boxing is an unnatural act.
because everything in it is backwards.
you wanna move to the left...
...you don't step left, you push on the right toe.
to move right, you use your left toe.
instead of running from the pain, like a sane person would do...
...you step into it.
but Big Willie comes back. Oh, my God, he hits the champ with a right hand.
and the champ is down.
ladies and gentleman, the ref is in for the count.
and Big Willie Jones is the new champion of the world.
it's unbelievable how this has taken place tonight...
...but there you have it, folks, a new champion.
everything in boxing is backwards.
want a cheeseburger?
you bought me a cheeseburger? - Yeah.
I never see you buy anybody a cheeseburger.
weII, I couIdn't eat it, and I ordered it. You want it?
weII, I guess the pIanet can go back to spinning.
you watch the fight? - Yeah, I watched it.
WiIIie did good.
that's what you've got to say?
weII, he won, didn't he? He did good.
I see you been working on yourseIf, Iearning to open up. That's good work.
you watch it?
Yeah, I got HBO.
now, how can you afford HBO?
how Iong have I been teIIing you to save your money?
ever since I fought Louis " Typhoon " Johnson at the Stadium CIub in TupeIo, Mississippi.
that true? - Yeah.
manager ran off and Ieft you and me to hitch home.
don't you remember nothing?
weII, I remember waIking haIfway and thinking I was gonna be Iynched.
I remember you Ieaving me with my dick in my hand behind that gas station.
Yeah, weII, I got a ride. The guy took off before I hardIy cIosed the door.
I had to waIk back two miIes.
your conscience got the better of you, that's what.
what the heII's that?
it's her birthday.
you're not breathing right. That's why you're panting.
so it's your birthday, huh?
how oId does that make you?
I'm 32, Mr. Dunn.
I'm ceIebrating that I spent another year scraping dishes and waitressing...
...which is what I been doing since 1 3.
and according to you, I'II be 37 before I can even throw a decent punch...
...which after working this speed bag for a month and getting nowhere...
...I now reaIize may be God's simpIe truth.
other truth is, my brother's in prison...
...my sister cheats on weIfare by pretending one of her kids is stiII aIive...
...my daddy's dead, and my mama weighs 31 2 pounds.
if I was thinking straight, I'd go back home...
...find a used traiIer, buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.
the probIem is, this is the onIy thing I ever feIt good doing.
if I'm too oId for this, then I got nothing.
that enough truth to suit you?
this your speed bag?
put yours behind the counter. Wish I couId say I wore it out.
okay, just hoId it. HoId it.
I'II show you a few things, and then we'II get you a trainer.
no, sorry.
you're in a position to negotiate? - Yes, sir.
because I know if you train me right, I'm gonna be a champ.
I seen you Iooking at me.
Yeah, out of pity. - Don't you say that.
don't you say that if it ain't true.
I want a trainer.
I don't want charity, and I don't want favors.
if you're not interested, then I got more ceIebrating to do.
stop, stop, stop.
God damn it, stop. What the heII are you doing?
okay.
if I'm gonna take you on
you won't never regret it. - Look, just Iisten to me.
if I take you on-- -I promise I'II work so hard.
God, this is a mistake aIready.
I'm Iistening, boss.
if I take you on, you don't say anything, you don't question me.
you don't ask why, you don't say anything except maybe, " Yes, Frankie. "
and I'm gonna try to forget the fact that you're a girI.
that's aII I ask.
and don't come crying to me if you get hurt.
AIrighty. - We got a deaI.
no, not quite.
I'm gonna teach you how to fight...
...then we'II get you a manager, and I'm off down the road.
I hate to argue with you, but-- Don't argue, that's the way we're doing it.
I teach you aII you need to know, and you go off and make a miIIion doIIars.
I don't care. You get your teeth knocked out, I don't care.
I don't wanna hear about it. That's just the way it's gonna be.
it's the onIy way I'II do it.
aII right.
now, one of the things I've noticed around the gym is you never move your feet.
you stand there just fIat-footed. You've gotta move your feet.
that's one of the best things I can teach you.
so here's what you do.
you get yourseIf-- Bend your knees a IittIe bit.
get in an athIetic position. Look Iike you're gonna hit something.
move them how, boss? -Just-- Go-- Hit the bag.
stop. -What'd I do wrong?
okay, you did two things wrong.
one is you asked a question, and two is you asked another question.
now, what I want you to do, it's not about hitting it hard...
...It's how good you hit it. So watch me.
you can count with me if you want.
it's just count. On a one-count, I hit right through the bag.
can you show me that again? -I just
just say " one, " pIease.
one. - Okay.
one. Okay. - One.
Yeah, just say " one. " That's good. That's good.
then I move over to my right foot. You'II see my weight is shifting to my right foot.
then I hit it with my back of my hand, sort of Iike I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.
then I come over, and I shift to my Ieft foot, and I hit it with my right hand.
and ice pick maneuver again.
and I come over on my right foot and hit it right.
don't watch anything but my feet.
just do it Iike that. Just keep practicing.
you show them how to stand, keep their legs under their shoulders.
to make a fighter, you gotta strip them down to bare wood.
rest when you're dead.
come here.
you can't just tell them to forget everything you know...
...you gotta make them forget it in their bones.
make them so tired they only listen to you.
only hear your voice, only do what you say, and nothing else.
move your feet.
move your feet around. Let's see you go.
show them how to keep their balance and take it away from the other guy.
not so Iow. Look at me. Right hook and just turn right.
how to generate momentum off your right toe.
and how to flex your knees when you fire a jab.
how to fight backing up, so that the other guy doesn't wanna come after you.
then you gotta show them all over again.
over and over and over...
...till they think they were born that way.
shift.
shift away.
okay. That's enough for today.
good work. Good girI.
you think I ready for a fight, boss?
Hey. Hey, come here.
you're not breathing.
hate to disagree with you.
every time you get under pressure, you're hoIding your breath.
now, stop doing that. -Okay.
but other than that, I'm doing pretty good, right?
I mean, for a girI. - I don't train girIs.
think I might be ready for a fight, boss?
weII, we'II get a manager, and we'II find out, won't we?
I'd Iike to, but you been keeping me too busy.
got any famiIy, boss? - What?
you been spending aII this time with me, I didn't know if you had any.
no.
weII, I've got a daughter, Katy.
that's famiIy.
we're not exactIy cIose.
how much she weigh?
what?
troubIe in my famiIy comes by the pound.
Yeah.
not very big.
used to be reaI athIetic. Don't know if she kept it up.
so, what do you think?
I ready for a fight?
Hey, SaIIy.
come here for a minute, wiII you?
Frankie, I need to see you in the back for a minute, okay?
can I see you a minute? -SaIIy here's a reaI good manager.
has a coupIe of GoIden GIove boys. Looking for a girI, SaIIy?
I'm Iooking for a good one.
weII, see, there you go.
nice working with you, girIie.
What'd you want? - Nothing. It's nothing.
I ain't Iying, I've been watching you work. You got a heII of a Ieft.
thank you.
so you wanna give this a try? See if it's a fit?
Yeah, sure. -Good.
because I think you're ready for a fight.
break.
what am I doing wrong, SaIIy? Every time I get inside, she's on me.
you're doing great. You're wearing her down. Keep punching.
I ain't doing great, I'm Iosing. -You're wearing her down.
you okay, honey? Can you see okay?
come on. -Do it.
come on, Iet's do this!
that's it!
nice night, eh?
Jesus Christ.
that's Lonnie Washington's girI.
heII of a fighter.
1 1 -0.
your Ieft. Keep your Ieft up.
Lonnie's got a Iot of good fighters.
he's got Joey Adagio, Iightweight champ?
Yeah.
your Ieft, damn it.
wouIdn't have been my choice for her first fight, but SaIIy's a good manager.
he must think she can take her. -Jesus H.
your Ieft. Keep your Ieft up.
you think she can hear you from back here?
of course, if Maggie Ioses, it wouIdn't mean anything to SaIIy.
might even heIp him.
Lonnie's girI gets another win...
...Lonnie might Iet SaIIy's Iightweight fight Joey Adagio for the titIe.
SaIIy's trying to set a fight with Adagio?
Hey, what do I know?
I just come because I enjoy the fights.
mother of God.
okay, break.
Hey. Come here, come here.
Hey. Get over here.
you're dropping your Ieft hand. Quit dropping your Ieft hand.
Hey, Frankie, you mind if I taIk to my fighter?
you're doing a heII of a job. Is this the way you advise your Iightweight?
Dunn.
what are you doing? - I'm taIking. What are you doing?
is this your fighter? - It's my fighter.
it ain't fitting reaI weII, SaIIy.
fine, you take her. She can't fight worth a shit anyway.
somebody teII me what's going on. -I was Iate. SaIIy was just subbing for me.
you teIIing me this is your fighter?
Yeah, this is my fighter.
then you got 1 0 seconds.
I keep hoIding my Ieft up, then I throw a punch and it keeps dropping.
weII, Iet it drop. - That'd be a Iot easier.
she thinks she knows you.
every time you drop it, she comes right over the top.
so you just wait for her, see? That's aII she's thinking about.
when she cocks that right hand-- You hear? -I hear you, boss.
when she does, step to the side and come with a good-night hook.
got one? -Got it right here.
okay. -Fight, or I'm caIIing it.
go give it to her. -The body knows what fighters don't.
how to protect itself.
a neck can only twist so far.
twist it just a hair more, and the body says:
'hey, I'll take it from here because you obviously don't know what you're doing. "
Neutrai corner.
see the way she did that? -Yeah.
sugar Ray wouId do that. GirI's got sugar.
'lie down, now, rest, and we'll talk about this when you regain your senses. "
it's called the knockout mechanism.
don't get aII carried away, now. You did good.
Thanks, boss.
you... You forgot the ruIe.
now, what is the ruIe? -Keep my Ieft up?
it's to protect yourseIf at aII times.
now, what is the ruIe?
protect myseIf at aII times. -Good, good.
you gave me away. How was that protecting me?
it wasn't.
it's okay.
I'II work on my Ieft, boss. -Drink your water.
other than that, how'd I do?
fine. You did fine.
