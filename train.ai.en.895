will you guys stop? We're trying to read here.
why would she invite two ex-husbands?
Oh, here he goes. Tony, you have already learned who sent out the invitation.
can you not just leave it at that?
I mean, how would you like it if I knew all your secrets?
I don't have any secrets. I'm an open book.
just give me the CliffsNotes.
once at summer camp, there were these twins named Marcy and Lois.
it's a long story.
um, okay, fortunately, Keeler's hard drive was insulated in a loaded footlocker.
unfortunately, it's still a little fried.
um, here's what I've man... what we... have managed to put together.
so far, it supports everything Keeler has told you...
the task force, Cyprus, arms dealers... all of it.
nothing new?
well, these are the arms dealers targeted by the task force.
small fish in a big pond, just like Keeler said.
on the surface, it seems harmless.
or as harmless as an arms dealer can be.
but as a whole, there's a pattern here, and it's a pattern that Keeler didn't even see.
as each one of these dealers were eliminated, their business had to move elsewhere.
so we've been tracking terrorist chat in and out of Cyprus.
okay. And get this.
in the last year, almost all of the weapons trafficking has been swallowed up by one arms dealer.
a dealer named Jinn.
no one's ever seen Jinn.
that's a supernatural being from Arab folklore.
like a... a genie.
so you're saying that this Jinn profited from Operation Birdsong?
big time.
Abbs, you find anything in the book about who's running this show?
I got something here, boss.
as pressure mounted, he would nervously clear his throat, choking on his own guilt.
fully recovered, Admiral?
special Agent Gibbs. Bringing me flowers?
are you Jinn?
I don't know what you're talking about.
who's he? - Fornell. FBI.
the more the merrier. - Sir, I took the liberty of perusing your bank accounts.
it's not bad on a government salary.
what are you insinuating?
I also pulled your cell phone records.
you received a text message from a burn phone last night, guiding you to Keeler's storage locker.
somebody sent you into a trap.
your buddy Jinn tying up loose ends?
jinn paid you for those guns. All you had to do was cash his check.
blackmail?
or you just that greedy?
now, you don't have to say anything. I know I wouldn't.
I'll bet you didn't count on Jinn trying to cover tracks, though.
burn the book.
take out everyone involved. Even you.
Where's Jinn? Local?
it's all done via computer.
but I can tell you where she is.
she?
this is who the admiral was afraid of? A college coed?
mark Zuckerberg created a social network.
why can't Alexis Ross organize a $100 million arms trade from her college dorm room?
well, according to Keeler, he never knew who brokered the sale.
she's sort of a combo platter of Reese Witherspoon from Legally Blonde and Russell Crowe from The lnsider.
she's dangerous. - And kind of cute.
Oh, come on, Tony. She sells weapons.
from her dorm room.
with a minor in phys ed, maybe.
so... how long will this take?
I have an econ paper due tomorrow, and the prof doesn't give extensions.
one hour ago, my people picked up a small-time hood named Charles LeBaron.
40 minutes later, he confessed to planting explosives in a self-storage facility after you paid him to do it.
on your computer, we found names, locations, and routing numbers for known terrorists.
how did a sweet little thing like you get wrapped up in all this?
evidence points to you. You bullet-proof, Jinn?
did she just sigh at Gibbs?
Yes, she did.
you might want to play back my confusion later, Special Agent Gibbs.
your accusations sound a little crazy.
you want crazy?
crazy is a college kid sitting in her dorm room with posters on the wall and her music blaring, making money off of weapons that kill innocent people.
question: If that were true, how is that different from government types who put weapons in the hands of private contractors, the mujahideen and the Somalis?
you think I'm some messed-up teenager grasping for a cause?
Yeah, I think those pretty pink nails are plenty dirty.
sorry.
I'm just a sweet little thing. Remember?
these two murders will put you away for life.
go for it. Try to connect the dots.
I've been studying for days, and I certainly didn't kill anyone.
she's got to be the one.
I mean, maybe she didn't do it with her own hands, but she planned it, she paid for it.
Nope. Definitely not our Miss Poison Ivy League.
it's like Lisbeth Salander meets scary Katy Perry.
she's not the killer, Gibbs. She's not our killer.
I scrubbed through every byte of her computer.
she's been a very bad girl.
she may be an arms dealer and may have blown up the storage locker, but she only got a digital copy of Lieutenant Keeler's book from Hindley yesterday.
Casey and Archer were already dead.
the bad girl couldn't have known the book was a threat.
so if the arms deals are not the reason for the murders, then what is?
I think that's probably the same cinnamon roll that's been here ever since I first started.
it's looking pretty good to me right now.
first one in, last one out.
so, I read your book.
I got a copy of it off of Alexis's computer.
I almost read the whole thing before I realized I missed the most important part...
dedication page.
for E. A.,with love and thanks for the happiest days of my life.
I got this off your hard drive.
why didn't you tell us you had an affair with Elise Archer?
it didn't seem right.
respectful now that she's gone.
you know, I got this for her.
it's made from sea glass.
when we returned to the States, she gave it back.
I understood. You know, she had her life, a husband.
I just thought maybe if I waited long enough...
now I'll never know.
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
Yeah, Abbs. - Come to my lab.
Yeah, I'll be right down.
you knew enough to love her, Lieutenant.
that's all that matters.
Abbs. - It's "sux," Gibbs!
what sucks? - No, it doesn't suck.
it, it's... it is "sux..." S-U-X.
I had to run three different blood samples through mass spec to find it.
I found minute traces of succinylmonocholine in Agent Archer's blood.
that's a byproduct of the muscle relaxant suxanmenthonium chloride, AKA sux.
it just, it breaks down really easily in the blood.
that's why I missed it the first two times.
okay, so...?
so, the dose that Agent Archer was given was so strong that she was temporarily paralyzed.
that's why Ducky didn't find any defensive wounds.
it's not that she didn't fight back.
she couldn't fight back. - Which definitely sucks.
where does someone get something like this? - Okay, here's the kicker.
there's so many undesirable side effects that it's relegated to only one specialty.
emergency medicine.
Hello?
you take us to the wrong address, J? - Nope.
man in distress. Says this is it.
that's me; I'm in distress.
or maybe I'm just hungry.
I don't know. It's hard to tell.
I don't understand. What are you guys doing here?
we're here to see you, Derrick.
archer, what's this about?
nothing, Jonny. Nothing.
I disagree.
did you tell your partner to take some time, few nights ago...
spend a couple hours with his girl, off the clock?
he said no one would know. - Yeah.
Jon, go get a coffee.
you asked us why the book got your wife killed, but you already knew.
took the copy right off her nightstand.
what was that dedication again?
I got to stop.
great idea!
Oh, I'm sorry. Did we get you?
gee, you think? - Oh, here.
here you go.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
here, touch me - you'll make it even.
no, thank you.
I... That didn't come out right.
what a jerk!
all right, all right!
let go! - Man, sober up.
dude, you okay?
I'll drop you off back at base, man.
no, no, no, I'm just going to walk. Shake the stink off.
play with me.
please... play with me. Play with me.
Yes, they came in this morning.
in fact, I'm wearing them right now.
Oh, yes. They feel really, really good when I move.
I have to get to work.
Yeah, I'm going to have to call you back.
Yeah, I,uh... I miss you too, Ray.
Yeah. Okay, bye.
I do.
and I do not care who knows.
well, sounds like you're getting pretty serious.
I am happy. Ray is happy.
we are meeting in New York, next weekend.
he's taking me to the opera.
the opera?
does his boyfriend know about you?
no, but his mom does.
you've met the rents?
when are we going to get to meet him?
all in good time, McGee.
and how is your... special new someone?
I don't have a special anything. And it's none of your business.
huh! Well, someone's keeping secrets.
that's pretty classic, coming from the woman who's kept her...
boyfriend hidden from us for months.
I'm not hiding anything.
ray knows all about you.
again, why haven't we met him?
because Ray knows all about you.
I'm not the one you should be worried about, right?
I've seen men of steel melt from a mere glance from Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
that flinty, steel-eyed stare that makes those men turn into sniveling little girls.
it's just... Morning, boss.
grab your gear.
got a dead Naval officer in Virginia.
Hey, Duck. Think we could get a better look at this?
he's wrapped up tighter than a Thanksgiving turkey.
his ankles are bound. That's odd.
well, we'll move as fast as we can.
might want to move a little faster.
looks like the locals want to get back to work.
well, they probably didn't expect him to be part of their spring crop.
although human remains would make a... excellent fertilizer.
Oh, that is stinky.
Ooh, yeah. Just a little.
Yeah, throat's cut.
and a deep cut at that.
had a pet gerbil when I was a kid.
I, uh, buried him in my mother's vegetable garden after he died.
and that year, her plum tomatoes were better than ever.
I used to think of him every time I bit into one, and...
cause he-he was talking about the, uh, fertilizer...
so, uh... You're right. I'm sorry, sorry.
skin is dehydrated.
decomposition has set in.
how long ago?
uh, my guess - four to five days.
he's extremely clean.
there's no defensive wounds.
no obvious signs of a struggle.
no blood pooling.
I'd say he was killed somewhere else and left here.
Gibbs, the farm's owner says he has only seen his employees around this area the past week.
that's about half a mile from the road.
no street lamps.
easy to come and go without being seen.
police report someone found a wallet and a watch in a dumpster near town.
no one claimed it.
you get an I. D?
uh, it was empty except for about 50 bucks.
whoever killed the captain wasn't after his cash.
uh, this is not a captain.
seaman Derek Balfour.
whoever killed him could have played dress-up.
something is in his lapel here, Doctor.
it's a Metro card.
based on the date stamp, purchased after his time of death.
Jethro, take a look at this.
this young man's gaze has been altered, postmortem.
Yeah, someone physically adjusted his eyeballs.
combine where they're looking now, with the Metro card and, uh...
what is he looking toward?
D. C.
it's a message.
seaman Derek Balfour.
22. Enlisted three years ago, stationed at Norfolk.
scheduled to ship out next week for a second tour to the Middle East.
service record?
C. O. says he's likeable, but a bit of a loose cannon.
not captain material, boss.
he was dedicated, though.
seaman Balfour lacks the skills necessary for promotion,yet has great devotion to the Navy.
he works harder than anyone else.
and played even harder.
written up for a drunk-and-disorderly, six months ago-mandatory alcohol counseling.
passed with flying colors. Not a blemish on his record since.
did he have a family?
mom's in Rhode Island.
they've been estranged for years.
dad was never in the picture. No siblings.
left home when he was 15;
supported himself with odd jobs until he joined the Navy.
a friend of Seaman Balfour's says they were at a D. C. club together last Thursday night.
they had several beers, and left separately around 1: 00 a. m.
okay, phone records, e- mails, financials. - On it.
I thought you were in Miami.
I lied. I was in the parking lot.
you have been very creepy today.
sneaky. And yes, I have.
but for a very good cause.
introductions, Ziva?
um, uh, right. Of course.
uh, Ray Cruz... this is everyone.
special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
pleasure, sir.
agent Timothy McGee. - How are you?
Tony DiNozzo. - Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo. It's a pleasure.
special Agent. Heard good things.
Yeah. Likewise.
friend of Ziva's is a friend of ours.
of course, the last time she had an out- of- town visitor, our director ended up in the hospital.
well, I come in peace. Promise.
and despite the injuries your director sustained, the agency thinks that you navigated that situation very well.
you CIA?
just celebrated my 13th year, sir.
that's funny.
Ziva failed to mention your line of work.
well, that's what I do. It's - it's not who I am.
that's a very Zen, New- Agey kind of attitude for someone who installs puppet regimes for a living.
okay. Uh, Gibbs, can I give Ray a tour?
Yeah, sure.
don't lose him.
it's been a pleasure meeting all of you.
so it's not Renaissance Ray.
it's CIA Ray. He's "CI-Ray."
you really should get that checked out. It's like a bad tick or something.
there's something about this guy, boss.
his smile is disturbing.
haven't seen a smile like that since Christian Bale's barely audible Batman in The Dark Knight.
DiNozzo. - Right. Back to work.
it's what I do, not who I am.
What's...?
it's just so weird.
so many Naval decorations for the low man on the totem pole.
sorry. No offense.
actually, Mr. Palmer, if Seaman Balfour had been totemized,
as it were, he would have been much closer to the top.
I don't follow.
native Americans designed their poles so that the lower you were on it, the higher they held you in esteem.
calling someone "low man on the totem pole" is, in fact, a compliment.
so all these years, Gibbs has been complimenting me.
Oh, I wouldn't go that far, Palmer.
how far are you getting, Duck?
as far as the evidence will allow - not very.
however, Seaman Balfour, here, died from loss of blood from a severed carotid artery.
a six-centimeter-deep cut.
they knew what they were doing.
and they knew not to leave anything behind.
the body was thoroughly cleansed.
I mean, I've been over it twice, Jethro.
there's nothing - no trace of blood, no fingerprints, no strand of hair.
Additionally... - Oh, the fingernails on both hands were just cut.
well, manicured is more like it.
and the skin is abraded in places where the person scrubbed so hard.
meticulous.
not to mention well-trained.
Oh, we did find traces of a rare, high-grade cleanser.
Abby is running tests.
medical background? - Perhaps.
but I wouldn't rule out someone from law enforcement, either.
someone who knows the value of a clean corpse.
greetings, Director.
what brings you to the nether regions of our building?
I am so sorry.
I had no idea that that was your parking spot.
I swear. - At ease, Palmer.
I'm just here to check on the case.
heard there were some unusual characteristics about it.
still putting it together.
I'm not here to disrupt that; just to get an update.
is that a problem?
no.
just don't see you down here much.
things change.
Dr. Mallard, tell me what you know so far.
right. Let me call you back.
Ah, Agent - sorry - Special Agent DiNozzo.
C. I. Ray.
need to get that?
it can wait. Just wrapping up an old case.
anything interesting?
can't talk about it.
C. I. Ray business?
Yep.
so, uh... How long you in town?
as long as Ziva will have me for.
Yeah, she's a tough nut to crack.
but, you know, once you navigate past that Mossad-influenced exterior and her inability to grasp cultural references, she's great.
I'm in love with her.
that's why I'm here.
to tell her? When are you going to do that?
I don't know.
tonight, tomorrow - soon.
you know, it feels good to finally get it out.
I'll bet.
you know, I want Ziva's friends to become my friends.
she's told me how close the two of you are.
I wouldn't say that.
well, she says you're like a brother to her.
meeting.
do me a favor - don't say anything to Ziva.
Hey, I gotta go.
where are you off to?
I have to see an old associate, but it shouldn't take too long, okay?
somebody sure left in a hurry.
he has work to do.
Yeah, so do we. Tell me what we got.
navy server showed nothing unusual in Seaman Balfour's e-mails.
but I did find this.
bank shows several charges on his debit card over the past four days.
various stores, various amounts.
dead guy on a shopping spree.
surveillance video?
Abby's still analyzing.
but so far, we've got no clear shot of the person taking Balfour's identity.
seaman Balfour's apartment manager says that someone has been staying in his apartment since last Friday.
day after he was murdered. - You got a description?
white male, unknown age.
is he there now?
manager saw him go into the unit this morning, but never come out.
DiNozzo, come on, let's go.
it's 203.
if you need, I got the key.
NCIS. Open up.
clear, boss.
tidy.
not a thing out of place.
except for this.
that is one empty refrigerator.
what the hell is that?
he likes leaving things behind.
what? You just happened to be in the neighborhood, Special Agent Barrett?
flower, huh?
that's a new one.
I'm going to take a look around, see what else I can find.
see what you can find?
I've been tracking the killer the past nine months.
three dead Navy men in three different ports.
what's your connection?
case started in Rota, Spain.
Rota. - Never been there. Hear it's nice.
seaman Balfour's murder fits the pattern, right down to the funny little ice cubes.
my killer, my case.
what I was thinking is we...
I'll have to call you back.
I take it Agent Barrett got settled in.
Yeah, for the second time.
you could have told me, Director.
it was need-to-know.
you didn't, so what's the problem?
you kept me in the dark... on purpose?
it just landed on our soil, Gibbs.
I'm telling you now.
called the Port-to-Port Killer.
victims are all Navy enlisted.
bodies found near bases in Sasebo, Guam, Rota.
M. O.'s the same every time: throats cut, redressed, thoroughly cleaned and wrapped in plastic.
no physical evidence left behind.
but he does always leave some kind of object.
that's a signature. - Maybe.
bread crumbs.
left this near the last body in Guam.
a peanut?
boiled. Grown in southeastern Virginia.
suggests that the killer may be on his way to the States.
agent Barrett was brought in last month in anticipation of that move.
unfortunately, we were right.
Balfour was the latest victim.
but he won't be the last.
the SecNav wants the Port-to-Port Killer found and locked up fast.
I suggest you get past your issues with E. J.running the lead on this and find him.
you're quiet.
I'm pensive.
if this is some kind of game, I'm not playing.
no game.
Oh, I get it. You don't like it when I play boss lady.
would have been nice to know you'd be showing up out of the blue like this.
you just saw me last night.
Yes, in my apartment, wearing my Elvis Costello T-shirt which was extremely gratifying, but I didn't expect you at my crime scene - sifting through my evidence.
technically, it was my crime scene and my evidence.
well, technically, you could have mentioned it.
it wasn't something I could share.
maybe it was something you didn't want to share.
that thing is pissing me off.
just move this... And...
what?
the skylight and the computer screen - a way to avoid awkward moments.
intriguing.
a riddle wrapped in a mystery wrapped in an enigma.
Joe Pesci, Oliver Stone's JFK - nice.
winston Churchill, Russia, 1939.
smarty-pants.
I don't think this is going to work out.
not with us on the same case. We should stop.
okay.
okay. Best we end it.
or not.
dinner my place?
I'll bring wine.
got anything, Abbs?
it's just that our crazed lunatic killer also happens to be a plant lover.
after comparing the flower that was found in Seaman Balfour's apartment to dozens of species that are indigenous to North America, I got a match.
behold the Pogonia ophioglossoides.
also known as the Snake-Mouth Orchid.
it's a rare species, Gibbs - so rare it's been put on the endangered list in several states.
Yeah, so?
so, if P2P- Port-to-Port Killer- I made that up myself- if P2P wants to grow one, he would have to do it himself, or find someone who could.
he knows his plants.
Oh, that's not all he knows.
seaman Balfour's wounds were clean - there were no ragged edges.
the angle and the bevel of the cut run in a straight line, so our weapon is...
surgical.
Yep, and it's a perfect match to this.
I also matched the cleanser that was found on the body.
it's an iodine-based scrub called Xeonphine.
it's made in Canada, and it's only sold to hospitals.
so... we're looking for someone in the medical field?
what, a doctor maybe?
Yeah, or a, a - a surgeon or a nurse maybe.
Abbs, do you need a doctor?
no, it's just... change, Gibbs.
change makes me itch.
it always has.
it's - it's Agent Barrett.
I'm not a fan. I mean, of change.
her - I don't mind.
she's feisty for someone so small.
um, and I like that.
not that I like her, because I don't really...
Abby. - Not like I like you.
Abbs. - I just - I like our family just the way it is.
nothing's going to change.
I do not trust her.
and I know that Gibbs does not trust her.
but she will be here running lead until we solve this case.
I mean throwing in someone new - it's never a good idea.
never.
I'm sorry. I'm rambling.
okay, so enough about my day.
how was the meeting with your associate?
can we talk about something other than work?
just - just for a while?
a very little while?
there's something that I want to tell you.
okay.
I... Ignore it.
wait.
okay. I'm sorry.
that was... that was McGee.
he had a question.
what did you need to tell me?
nothing.
it can wait.
the Port-to-Port Killer is a highly egotistical individual.
he's lethal and determined and... You're all welcome to join me.
I'm not really into yelling from way over here.
Yeah, we can hear you fine.
keep going.
suspect is a white male anywhere from 25 to 55, never married, no children.
born into money, he is charming, charismatic and very entitled.
are you sure we're not looking for Tony?
he's killed in Japan, Guam, Spain and now the U. S.
no connection between any of his victims besides the fact that they're all Navy or former Navy.
he is well-traveled, multilingual, adapts to other cultures easily.
and as you know, his M. O. suggests he has medical training of some kind.
doesn't tell us why he gives them a promotion before he dumps them.
or why he leaves things behind.
the flower from Balfour's apartment told us nothing.
could indicate where he's going next.
I think he's still here.
and he's not leaving anytime soon.
is that a hunch, Special Agent Barrett?
we're talking about a pathological individual!
he's smart, incredibly high-achieving...- Oh, I doubt it.
I think that these murders are his biggest achievement.
that a hunch, Agent Gibbs?
boss, I got something here you should see.
excuse me.
it's from Seaman Balfour's personal e-mail cache; most recent was the morning of his death.
you're crazy if you think "you're getting away with this, Balfour.
I'll kill you before that happens.
you got a name, McGee?
Yep. 24-year-old Bryce Leitner, heir to the Leitner timber fortune.
dropped out of med school two years ago, been traveling the world ever since.
and he has visited Japan, Guam and Spain in the past year.
do you have a location?
last known local address is a condo in Georgetown.
we can be done in ten minutes, or here all day. It's up to you.
I'm not saying anything.
let's talk about Sasebo, Japan.
why were you there?
starting without me, Special Agent Barrett?
we're just getting settled in.
you're in my chair.
need to know why you traveled so much the last year, Mr. Leitner.
you've been in D. C. two weeks? - Yeah.
and before you arrived here, you were in Europe and Southeast Asia.
we have e-mails you sent threatening Seaman Balfour's life.
yeah? So?
I hated the guy.
next time I see you, I'll take your head off.
it's a figure of speech.
Really? - Yeah.
I find that funny.
that's almost what the killer did.
you were in Japan, Guam, Spain - Where were you a week ago?
let him answer my question, Agent Gibbs.
why the threats to Balfour?
because that loser made a move on my girl.
can you believe that?
low-class piece of...
and just to spite me, she actually goes out with the jerk.
so I get screwed twice.
tell me, Bryce, what's it like to have it all?
the looks, the money, world travel... the women?
excuse us.
there are standards in there.
rules.
I can interrogate him however I want.
different strokes, Gibbs. You weren't getting anywhere with him and he's my suspect.
that's my room.
Vance put me in charge.
Vance isn't here.
I'm trying to establish that he was in all four cities at the same time of the murders.
focus on Balfour.
that's our body, that's our evidence, that's our case!
this is a multiple murder case!
start by pinning one murder on him, and then connect the others. That's how it's done.
maybe that's the old-school way.
it's my way.
I'm calling Vance.
I'll be talking to Leitner.
are you questioning whether I know what I'm doing, Agent Gibbs?
no, ma'am. I'm questioning the way you do it.
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
Yeah, Abbs, I'll be right there.
where are you going?
wherever you are.
did you guys have a fight?
Yes. - No.
excuse me.
Abbs, what do you got?
okay, so I ran Bryce Leitner's name through every intelligence and law enforcement database - AFIS, Interpol, DIA, CIA.
point, Abby?
Abbs, come on.
okay, so Leitner's in the system because of a DUl charge in Virginia last year.
okay. And? - And he gave blood.
what does that have to do with it?
only everything.
that, my fearless leader, is the Spanish fishing village of Rosa Verde.
there was a viral outbreak there last July.
about a thousand people were infected.
Leitner's blood had traces of the pertussis virus.
exactly. Which means...
he was in Spain at the same time as the Rota murder.
and he was here in D. C. on the date that Balfour was killed.
looks like my suspect is panning out, Agent Gibbs.
do you want to talk about it?
I'm telling you, you mess with the Great White, you're gonna get eaten.
I'm not afraid of him.
that's your first mistake.
look, there's a pretty good chance I just caught the Port-to-Port Killer.
besides, Gibbs isn't exactly in Vance's good graces these days.
there's your second mistake.
I get the feeling they're not on the best of terms, and Vance outranks him.
okay... I've seen a few directors come and go.
there's only been one Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
do the math.
Yeah, and there's only one Anthony DiNozzo.
actually, there are two.
you know, this case may take me more than a few weeks for me to wrap up.
And?
and I'm just saying, I could get used to this.
I like the city life and these offices, despite that ridiculous skylight.
well, you get used to that.
well, then maybe your coworkers could get used to the idea of me being here on a more...
permanent basis.
I look at you and how you've made this place work for yourself.
and it's your home.
it's all about the people around you.
Yeah.
I'm starting to get that.
agent David, C.I. Ray.
stop calling him that.
it's okay. I kinda like it.
agent Cruz.
wait - uh, do you two know each other?
well, yeah. Didn't he tell you?
tell me what?
ray's our CIA liaison with NCIS on the Port-to- Port Killer case.
he has been from the start.
look, I... - No.
okay, well, you lied to me, Ray. I mean, what does the CIA call it?
do the call it "disinformation"? A cover story?
I was protecting you, okay?
I do not need protection!
it was need-to-know information.
I was not allowed to tell you, period.
did you sleep with Agent Barrett?
no, no. And if I did, I would have told you about it.
I didn't come here for this case, Ziva.
I came here for you.
Oh, just stop it! Stop it!
was any of it real? - Yes.
were you just planning on using me to get information, just in case things with Barrett didn't pan out?
I mean, was that it?!
I mean, am I part of this back-up plan?
no, you're overreacting.
Oh, my gosh! You want to see me overreact, Ray?
why don't you tell me another lie?
why don't you tell me the sky is yellow?
why don't you tell me that water is not wet or that sand is not dry?
why don't you tell me that you love me?
I love you.
I love you, Ziva.
I don't believe you.
what about our time in Miami, huh?
the trips?
what about the romantic dinners? I mean, was...
was that all part of your plan?
it was real. - It is real.
we are real.
I wish I could believe you.
you have the wrong guy.
Leitner- he's not the Port-to-Port Killer.
he's a mule for the Syrian government.
we've been watching his every move for the last 16 months, and there's no way he could have killed any of them.
you didn't hear this from me.
Gibbs, I got to talk to you.
I need to tell you something.
I cannot tell you how I know this, and you cannot ask.
all right. Tell me what?
Bryce Leitner is not the Port-to-Port Killer.
how sure are you?
very.
okay.
turns out our chief suspect isn't the Port-to-Port Killer.
how can you be so sure?
reliable source.
how reliable? - Very.
well, what's that supposed to mean?
it means Leitner has alibis for all three international murders.
still leaves our local body.
McGee, Balfour: crime scene photos. Put'em up.
look, I've been on this case for nine months.
I've studied every piece of evidence; I've studied these photos a hundred times in the last 24 hours.
Yeah, well, we're going to study them again.
go close-up on his decorations.
what?
service Warfare Pin.
four Navy air medals.
distinguished Flying Cross.
there's no way a Black Shoe could have a Distinguished Flying Cross and four air medals.
boss, this guy should have pilot wings.
so the killer made a mistake when re-dressing the victim?
has he ever made a mistake before?
never. The guy's meticulous.
this is a message. He wanted us to see these.
McGee, put up a map of the murders.
all port cities. I've already been over this.
airports?
and I've already checked the flight manifests for all passengers...
not interested in passengers.
hubs. - Hubs?
hubs.
MTAC, now.
stay.
told you not to play with the Great White.
homeland just had FAA transfer all encrypted flight watch data.
do it.
airlines servicing all four cities where the Port-to-Port Killer struck.
well, there's four airlines that service Sasebo and Guam, but not Rota.
there's only one that services all three cities and D. C. - Espree Airlines.
they go to all four international hubs, as well as Reagan and Dulles.
cities are transfer points.
meaning stopover points for pilots, flight crew, stewards and maintenance workers.
checking the employee records for Espree Airlines.
all right.
now these are the names of the various flight personnel who had stopovers in the cities where the Port-to-Port murders occurred.
how many served in the U. S. Navy?
six.
how many were in all four cities at the times of all four murders?
one.
Nathan Finney, U.S. Navy, retired.
put him up.
f-18 jockey, top of his Top Gun class in San Diego.
served in Gulf Wars One and Two.
that explains the decorations.
80 bombing sorties in downtown Baghdad.
our killer's a war hero?
give me an address.
just outside Alexandria.
clear.
clear.
clear.
nothing here, boss.
out here!
Nathan Finney, with a bad case of freezer burn.
heat wave in Autopsy.
I guess there really is global warming.
Yeah, Autopsy is indeed topsy-turvy today, Mr. Palmer.
nice alliteration Doctor.
what do we got?
based on the depth, angle of penetration, and the keenness of the blade, I'd say it was...
same scalpel as the murders.
Yes. Carotid artery and windpipe severed with great precision.
you have a time of death?
I'd say he's been dead and frozen for at least six weeks.
so you've got one more dead body, but no Port-to-Port Killer, is that right?
we're confident we're closing in.
good, because SecNav tasked me to solve this case.
so, I'm to tell him what?
we got a bouquet of flowers, some more ice, and no suspects.
I put both of you on this case to double the chances of catching this lunatic.
now I'm wondering if I didn't double his chances of escaping.
look, I don't care how you do it- together, apart, mean, nice- just get it done.
so I guess we're still partners.
see you in the morning, Special Agent Barrett.
you sleeping with DiNozzo?
it's not against NCIS policy to date co-workers.
it's against my policy.
this team operates on respect.
you don't respect me... - No.
I don't trust you.
Really? - Really.
except to work the case, leave my team alone.
we clear?
shouldn't drink alone; it's too depressing.
it's a club soda, and I'm not depressed.
well... I wouldn't blame you. It's been a rough day.
maybe for you.
I'm fine.
if you were fine, you wouldn't be here.
okay, then. Let's go.
I would like a drink.
and it is depressing to drink alone.
Barkeep!
anything old and gold. I might be getting a cold.
sorry. Scotch on the rocks. Thank you.
comin' up!
he's CIA.
they have a sworn duty to protect what they know.
same as we do.
he was just doing his job.
he lied to me, Tony.
Yeah. Because...
he cares about you.
does not matter, because it's over.
scotch, sir.
what about you and EJ?
what about us?
what are you going to do when Gibbs finds out?
I understand this one, Ziva. I understand her.
that's why it's working.
this is for you.
I didn't order that.
guy in the booth did.
I wonder who?
good morning, Washington, D.C.
it is 6: 45 a. m.man, and a chilly 59 degrees, so let me warm you up with a little Jamaica Josh.
you got in early.
I was lost all weekend without my credit cards.
I was just about to cancel them when I got your text.
Where'd you find the wallet? - In the copy room.
found it when I was mopping behind the shredder.
how the heck did it get there?
Ah... beats me.
you saved me a fortune. Couldn't go shopping.
wish my wife would lose hers.
had your coffee yet?
well, as a matter of fact, I was thinking...
come on. I'm buying.
any distraction on a Monday morning's a good one.
dead REFLECTION
it was floating in your gin and tonic?
real eye-opener.
that must've really freaked you out.
Yeah. Thought I needed a drink before; Really needed one after.
now, where's the eyeball now? - Ducky has it.
he's not smiling.
when is he?
special Agent Barrett and her team are taking over the Port-to-Port case.
her "team"? - Agents Cade and Levin are finally en route.
I'd appreciate it if you gave them a warm welcome.
they're top-notch agents.
maybe you can pick up a few pointers.
W-what did she mean by that?
what are we doing, boss? - Dead lieutenant.
d Ring, Pentagon.
let's go.
well, Mr. Palmer?
her C-5 and C-6 vertebrae are shattered.
And?- No visible signs of bruising or-or ligatures.
which suggests?
that her neck was broken efficiently.
someone had martial-arts skills.
approximate time of death?
how long was Lieutenant Ross under your command?
uh, she came aboard last summer. Um, August.
I can't believe something like this has happened.
in the Pentagon, for God's sake.
when's the last time you saw her, Captain?
Friday. She had taken some personal time off last week.
uh... doctor's appointments.
said she wanted to come in this weekend to catch up.
what exactly does your department do?
recordkeeping, mostly.
we're part of the Joint DOD Command Center.
sensitive stuff, huh? - Mm, some.
but mostly we handle routine documents.
got it.
duck, you got a TOD? - Mr. Palmer?
the lieutenant died between 2: 00 and 3: 00 Sunday afternoon.
yesterday?
Yeah, McGee. Yeah. On my way.
the Pentagon, boss... One of the most secure buildings in the world.
there's several rooms just like this one, covering different rings throughout the building.
why don't you tell him how many sides it has, Tim.
we pulled this video from 2: 13 Sunday afternoon.
seems friendly enough.
and then... watch this.
pretty professional.
no question what happened.
petty Officer Donner.
you ever have a murder case this easy, boss?
how quickly do you need it done?
can we get it today or tomorrow?
that work for you? - Yeah!
that'd be fantastic. - Awesome.
do you need something, David?
no, I'm fine.
well, Lieutenant Ross's roommate's here.
being brought to the conference room.
I'm not sure how I feel about that woman.
I know what you mean.
she is what my Bubbe David would, uh, call a real nidchefet.
I can only guess what that means.
loses something in translation.
neither Donner nor his wife were at the residence.
you put out the BOLO yet? - Yes, Tony. What'd you find?
well, both Petty Officer Donner and Lieutenant Ross worked in the same department.
they were both very friendly and cordial to each other.
none of their coworkers noticed any animosity.
there is no apparent motive for him murdering her, Gibbs.
petty Officer Eric Donner was formerly attached to a covert Navy Special Warfare unit and trained in hand-to-hand combat.
but an injury two years ago sidelined him to the clerical job he has now at the Pentagon.
what's she doing with that geek Steve from I. T?
I have no idea.
Donner's wife is named Kelsey.
she's a civilian security guard at the Indian Head Naval Support Facility.
our victim, Lieutenant Ross, was an Annapolis graduate, born in Missoula, Montana.
her parents and a younger brother still live there.
she married? - Single.
shared an apartment with a roommate in Alexandria.
that roommate's actually here, being brought to the conference room.
McGee, take DiNozzo. Go.
Ziva, you're with me.
we appreciate you coming in, Miss Park.
do Lauren's parents know?
casualty Assistance Officers are notifying them.
there you go.
when was the last time you saw her?
Sunday morning.
we had coffee at Starbucks before she went in to the office.
did you think anything of it when she didn't come home last night?
she was seeing someone.
it wasn't unusual for her to spend the night out.
but she normally called.
who was she seeing?
we just need a name.
I guess now, under the circumstances, I can tell you.
he's married.
what's his name?
I don't know.
really.
she felt uncomfortable talking about it, and I didn't press.
I...
I knew Lauren.
she'd tell me when she was ready.
did she ever mention a Petty Officer Eric Donner?
I don't think so.
never seen him.
special Agents Gibbs and David.
got a call you were looking for me. What's up?
trying to find your husband.
something happen to Eric? - When did you see him last?
friday morning before he left for work.
you didn't see him this weekend? - No.
you do live together? - Yeah.
everything okay between you?
Yeah.
I got a text from him Friday night that said something came up.
and then he said he was going to call on Sunday, and... he didn't.
and you weren't worried.
I'm used to not knowing where my husband is.
for six years, he was attached to the Navy Special Warfare Unit.
everything he did was secret.
black ops.
he was gone a lot, and he couldn't tell me anything.
Eric didn't like being tied to a desk at the Pentagon.
he always wanted to get back into Spec Ops.
that's what I thought happened this weekend.
something went wrong, didn't it?
that's why NCIS is looking for him?
your husband is a person of interest in the murder of a coworker.
did he ever mention Lieutenant Lauren Ross?
no... I don't think so.
I think she knows more than she's telling us.
ya think? Let's stake out her house.
Hey, McGee.
looks like one of Barrett's team must have arrived.
didn't notice.
you're an investigator; You're paid to notice.
Hey, what are you doing? Don't mess with their stuff.
Oh, my gosh!
this is "ginormous"!
I haven't seen anything this big since John Candy's jockey shorts in Planes, Trains and Automobiles.
Tony, take the jacket off.
you think this guy's the Hulk or what?
I am an enormous, big dumb oaf.
the big dumb oaf has an I. Q.of 160.
you must be DiNozzo. - Hi.
I was warned about you.
he doesn't like it when people wear his hat.
miss Sciuto is expanding the DNA search.
all I can tell you now, Special Agent Barrett, is that the owner of the detached orb is male, had undergone LASIK surgery and, based on the condition of the retina, is in his 30s.
all right. Thank you, Dr. Mallard.
you're welcome.
very thorough young lady. - She's just doing her job.
my priority's the murder of Lieutenant Ross, Duck.
I got a suspect. I need to wrap it up.
you said you found something?
uh, I haven't begun the autopsy yet, but, uh,
I thought you should know the lieutenant was eight to ten weeks pregnant.
salads are not stakeout food.
well, they should be.
at least they don't stink up the car.
want one? - No!
your loss.
did Gibbs say anything to you about Agent Barrett?
you know, about... dating?
Nope.
are you sure he knows?
he's Gibbs. He knows everything.
he did read her the riot act, though.
well, that's not good, Tony. I mean, you should talk to Gibbs.
you and him go way back!
I mean, it's like the big rhinoceros in the room that no one wants to talk about.
elephant.
it's an elephant in the room.
it's not a hippopotamus, it's not a rhinoceros.
it's an elephant.
what about you and C. I.Ray?
I told you. It's over.
so you... Haven't talked to him?
well, I mean... he left messages, and texted, and e-mailed, but... I have not read them.
is he still in Washington? - Wait.
is that Donner?
that is most definitely not Eric Donner.
well, then, who is it?
whoever he is, he's getting a little squeeze from Mrs. Donner.
all right.
I'm going to download these pictures, send them to McAbby.
they can run some facial recognition.
I think it's easier if I run his license plate.
no, this is easier. - No, it's not.
I'll bet you.
I hope this doesn't take too long.
well, it shouldn't. We're only running the image against Naval officers.
you in a hurry? - Yeah, sort of. Um... yeah.
okay, got him.
commander Nelson Tunney.
great.
DiNozzo. - Tony. We got a name.
Yeah, I know. Commander Nelson Tunney.
if you already knew, then why did you keep us here so late?
sorry. Ziva ran the license plate.
let me talk to him.
Tony, Tunney was. Petty Officer Donner's former C. O.
in a Naval Special Warfare unit.
okay. Good work. Thanks. - Yep.
thought you were going to meet me in the squad room.
Oh! Hi. Simon. Hi.
sorry. No, uh, um, something came up.
we're still on for tonight?
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
let me just get my coat.
Hey, McGee.
Hey. Cade.
it's been a surreal experience, Agent Gibbs.
we've made crisis counselors available to the staff, but...
it has been hard to focus.
I understand.
have you found Petty Officer Donner?
no. Not yet.
I still can't believe there was any problem between him and Lieutenant Ross.
we have reason to believe they were having a sexual relationship.
you ever see any evidence of that?
no. Why would you think so?
we know she was dating a married man.
you sure? - Yeah. She was pregnant.
our M. E.is testing the fetus' DNA for a match.
agent Gibbs, um...
can I talk...?
um... Don't bother. I,um, I'll save you the time. I,um...
look, I am the married man having the affair with Lauren.
and most likely the father.
commander Tunney, this way, please.
excuse us. Sorry.
hmm, there you are.
I told you I didn't like your old cologne. This one's way worse.
it's not me. It's the commander.
Hey, how late did you and Ziva work last night?
I gotta get in there.
commander, when was the last time you saw Petty Officer Donner?
uh, last week.
where? - A sports bar on U Street.
I just got back from a tour of the Middle East. We got together to catch up.
how was he? - Seemed fine.
Kelsey Donner thought her husband might have been on assignment with your unit.
Yeah, Eric told me that he was bored with his clerical job at the Pentagon, but trust me, he wasn't doing anything for Spec War.
you're sure?
he was injured a couple years ago, in an accident.
he had to drop out of the unit.
he could never pass the physical.
when was the last time you saw Mrs. Donner, Commander?
she called yesterday, after she talked to you guys.
she was pretty upset.
I stopped by last night to console her.
you're saying something... What, what, what?
still messing with that? - Yeah.
they're talking, I just, I can't figure out what they're saying.
so, how did last night go?
last night?
Yeah. You and Special Agent Cade.
Oh, he's... great.
have you talked to him?
not really. - Oh, you should.
Simon doesn't know anyone in Washington.
he's living out of a hotel, still looking for a place.
thought I would show him around.
maybe I can get a reflection of her lips off this mirror here.
so where did you and Simon go?
Oh, we went to an Indian restaurant, and he spoke Hindi with the waiter.
and then we took a cab to a club in Georgetown.
we had a conversation in Swahili with the driver.
Oh, so he's a linguist... - Yeah. He's very, very, very smart.
and, and endearing.
he's a jock, too. He played football in college.
where? - Yale. He's all Ivy League.
well, I hope you didn't show him all your tattoos.
you're jealous.
let me take a look at this thing.
their lips are moving, but it's all distorted and out of focus.
I'm gonna have to work on it.
these are Petty Officer Donner's text and phone records.
his phone's not transmitting right now.
the last communication was the text. Donner sent his wife on Saturday.
from where? - Cell tower in Fairfax County.
there he is!
about time, man.
Cade. - Hey.
I thought you were going to the hotel first.
Nah, I came straight from Dulles. How you doing?
good.
what's that? - Photos.
a British sailor killed in Singapore.
kinda has some similarities to the Port-to-Port case.
it's probably nothing, but I thought you should see it.
I'll load it up.
meet the neighbors, Gayne.
special Agent Gibbs, DiNozzo and David.
heard a lot about you, Gibbs. - How are you?
Hey. - Hey.
Yeah, Gibbs. - Got it loaded.
Oh, put it up on the big screen.
like they have a big screen.
Wow! Jumbotron!
Where'd you get that?
steve in I. T.hooked me up. Pretty nice, huh?
Yeah. It's very, uh, motorized.
it's cool, huh?
gear up. Virginia State Police found Petty Officer Donner. Let's go.
is he talking, boss? - Nope. He's dead.
get the tire tracks.
duck! Tell me what happened.
I don't think he died in the accident.
there's no apparent trauma to the body.
so, what, car drifted off the road, came down the embankment?
what's the cause of death? - No idea.
but there is something odd.
he's no longer in rigor. - Meaning what?
well, he's been here long enough so that he's stiffened, and then un-stiffened.
you can tell by the skin slip, discoloration, marbling... been here a while.
how long? - At least four days.
that can't be.
we got video of him killing Lieutenant Ross at the Pentagon two days ago.
Jethro... This man could not have been there.
are you sure he's been dead four days, Ducky?
at least. Heart attack.
myocardial infarction, to be exact.
congenital condition, in his case.
probably never knew he had it.
it's not reflected in his medical records.
we sure this is Eric Donner?
fingerprints, dental records, DNA all match.
burn scars on his lower extremities, consistent with injuries received in a shipboard fire two years ago.
poor man was hospitalized for weeks.
so you're telling me this guy couldn't have killed his co-worker two days ago?
what's more, I was right.
Donner was dead when he was put in the car.
the blood-pooling indicated that the body had been moved.
sounds like you got a messy one, Gibbs.
like I should talk. I got two dead bodies down here and an eyeball.
I'm getting nowhere.
double-check. Everything. - I was planning to.
what can we do for you, Agent Barrett?
I got a thought.
need a crash course on the physiology of the eye.
Oh, Mr. Palmer is your man.
he's been a student of the subject for most of his life.
my father is a research ophthalmologist.
every night at dinner, he would pontificate on the wonders of the spherical organ.
the eyeball.
first you tell me my husband killed someone at the Pentagon on Sunday.
now you're telling me he died two days earlier, on Friday?
that's not possible.
I'm sorry for your loss, Mrs. Donner.
how did Eric die, Agent Gibbs?
heart attack.
he's never had heart problems.
this is crazy.
he-he couldn't have died on Friday.
I have text messages from him on Friday night and Saturday afternoon.
Yeah. Yeah, we're aware of that.
you have any idea what he might have been doing in Fairfax County?
no.
we think its possible his body was moved.
he had a heart attack, and his body was moved?
by who? - Maybe by whoever sent you these texts.
are you sure he wasn't working for his old Special Warfare unit?
talked to his former C. O.Commander Tunney.
no. He wasn't.
they were good friends.
nelson Tunney risked his life to save my husband during a fire.
they stayed in contact.
that's why I thought...
95 percent.
that's as high as the program will allow.
then either the program or Ducky is wrong.
maybe he has an evil twin.
no siblings.
tell me what else he did at the Pentagon on Sunday beside kill Lieutenant Ross.
well, we reviewed the security video and followed every one of Donner's steps.
from getting out of his car to entering and leaving the building.
in the process, we found this surveillance shot of Donner entering a restricted area just before his confrontation with Lauren Ross.
what's behind the door?
don't know. There's no surveillance cameras inside.
Tony's got a call in to Captain Painter.
What'd he say?
I have a call in to him.
the room, 3D315, you're asking about, is a file room.
why isn't there video surveillance in there?
it holds documents of the highest security level of the Joint DOD Command.
no photography or recording devices of any type are allowed.
what kind of documents?
top Secret orders.
SITREPS of covert ops. Stuff like that.
look, you have to understand.
these are hard copies, documents so sensitive they're not committed to electronic databases.
petty Officer Donner had clearance to enter the room?
Yes.
his I. D.card, along with a four-digit code that changed weekly, allowed access.
will we be able to determine what file he accessed?
good luck.
you have almost 70 years and several hundred thousand files to go through.
what you working on?
wood.
what's the occasion?
I thought we could talk.
so talk.
you know, I look up to you, boss.
I've learned a lot from you over the last ten years.
you've been a great teacher.
you got a point, DiNozzo?
I've always thought that the head-slaps were a sign of affection.
today, in the squad room, I was expecting one.
and I didn't... I didn't get it.
are you pissed at me?
rule number 12.
never date a coworker.
Yeah. I know.
she's pretty great, though.
EJ and I have a lot in common.
she's easy to be with, you know?
it's nice to have somebody to talk to...
NCIS doesn't have any policy against it.
you know, there are married agents, and technically, EJ and I...
well, we don't work together; We're on separate teams.
my team.
my rules.
sleeping with Barrett's a bad idea.
no offense, but my personal life is my business.
it's going to affect your work. - No, it won't.
already has. - I know what you're thinking.
that I've lost focus; that I've taken my eye off the ball.
I depend on you.
must be important.
Yeah, Abbs?
can you turn the music down?
geez.
is that what you wanted to show me?
no. This is something that Ducky asked me to analyze, and it can wait.
I know what Lieutenant Ross said before she was killed.
how do you know?
because I read lips. Did you forget?
okay, watch carefully.
Hey, Eric.
I didn't expect to see anyone here today.
uh, what's up?
I was just, uh... Catching up on some work.
okay.
look at Lieutenant Ross's face.
something is not right.
all right. Check out the reflection in the mirror.
I enhanced it and then I sharpened the image.
where are you going?
to call security.
you're not Eric. Who are you?
Gibbs, she knew that guy wasn't Petty Officer Donner.
you and Gibbs talk?
uh, tried to.
didn't go well.
what did he say?
well, he gave me a scolding.
it was like talking to my father.
he told me what not to do.
only made me want to do it more.
how did you leave it with him?
I don't know. Gibbs and I have hit a rough patch.
well, you're going to have to make some choices.
glad I'm not you.
you on stakeout again last night?
no.
two nights in a row. I thought I'd hear from you.
there was something I had to do.
listen, uh, we have to kind of cool it around the office from now on, you know what I mean?
you mean around Gibbs.
he intimidates you.
let's just say he presents a challenge.
he sees what he shouldn't see, hears what he shouldn't hear.
he's like Alec Baldwin in The Shadow.
and the Shadow always knows.
you're scared of him.
Yup. - I'm not.
you should be.
Oh, thank God.
you didn't go home last night?
Bert and I spent the night on the floor.
well, you two both sound excited.
Yes. Last night, I examined Petty Officer Donner's body once more, hoping I'd missed something.
and I had.
inside his external auditory meatus... his ear canal... I found traces of a foreign substance.
major Mass Spec and I identified it as calcium alginate powder.
it's a fast-curing medium used for making molds.
dentists make impressions of the mouth with it.
it's also perfect for making single-use molds of body parts...
hands, feet, faces...
we think someone made a life cast of Petty Officer Donner's face.
we're sure that's not Donner.
but whoever it is, they copied Donner's face, but they couldn't copy his voice.
these things are incredibly realistic, and really hard to make.
a mask? - I love it.
right out of Mission: Impossible III.
you know? Where Cruise pulls off the mask to reveal the evil Dougray Scott.
that was M: I-2, DiNozzo.
I'm sorry. I know my movies.
M: I-3. Directed by John Woo.
you're right about Woo. But it was M: I-2.
I was on set, standing next to him when he shot the scene.
you're right.
did you meet Tom Cruise?
Yeah. Nice guy.
well, that was a movie. This is real life.
so was that 20-year-old Chinese kid seeking asylum last October.
he got through Customs.
he got on a plane in Hong Kong wearing a mask that made him look like a 90-year-old Caucasian man.
Yeah. He bought it on line for something like $1, 200.
boss, the CIA's Office of Technical Services has an arm that creates and utilizes realistic disguises, including silicone masks.
Donner was attached to. Commander Tunney's Spec Op Warfare unit.
they do covert ops.
maybe they have a similar division.
aren't you guys already investigating Tunney?
I saw you bringing him in to the conference room yesterday.
you know Tunney?
no. His picture was in a file that I glanced at.
he and his Spec War unit are under investigation for the murder of a local tribal leader killed in Afghanistan.
Tunney denied he was ever in the area where it occurred.
you remembered the face?
special Agent Cade has a photographic memory.
of course he does.
Cade, thanks.
DiNozzo, McGee, find out if Spec War uses masks.
Ziva, come on.
you're with me. You're gonna go find Tunney.
did Abby say anything to you about Special Agent Cade?
the Hulk? No. I think she's fascinated by him.
I know what's going on in that paranoid little brain of yours, Timmy.
you're not the smartest kid in the class anymore, and you don't like it.
no, it's not that.
it's just, I enjoyed it more when it was just us.
doesn't it bother you, having Barrett's team around?
my life was a lot simpler before she got here.
how so?
well, Gibbs is giving me grief about sleeping with her.
you're sleeping with Special Agent Barrett?
catch up, Tim. Whole Navy Yard knows about it.
you the guys from NCIS?
special Agents DiNozzo and McGee.
we're looking for Miles Hogan.
hold your creds up!
thank you.
miles? - Yeah.
right. I've never seen guys get cleared so fast.
normally it takes, like, a poly and a two-week background check.
well, we are federal agents investigating a murder at the Pentagon, Miles.
Yeah, right.
I was told to give you my full cooperation.
here you go. - Thanks.
we were going to ask if you had the capability of making a mask, but guess we have our answer.
that is so realistic.
can I ask you a question?
this mask bears an uncanny resemblance to the master of suspense himself.
is this Alfred Hitchcock?
I call this one The Mole.
he's made of super-thin silicone that looks and feels real right down to the pores.
uh, I'd rather that you... Okay.
look on the inside. Feel this. It's smooth, huh?
it stretches over the wearer's face.
it moves with the facial muscles.
stroke the, uh... stroke the hair.
each one of these is individually punched.
Mr. Hogan, we believe this man is wearing a mask.
okay. This a joke.
no.
come here for a second.
this is the positive I made the mask from.
it was a rush job. I worked 36 straight hours on this last weekend.
thank God for Caf-POW!
you admit that you made the mask?
Yeah.
it's what I do here.
petty Officer Donner had a mask made of himself?
no. He was dead.
you made a mask of a dead guy?
Yeah. - You don't find that a little strange?
a lot of what I do around here is strange.
you didn't tell anyone what you did?
I work in one of the most clandestine divisions of one of the most clandestine agencies in the world.
I tell anyone what I do, I can go to Leavenworth for the rest of my life.
and if I get a call from upstairs, I do what I'm told.
who called?
commander Tunney.
he heads up one of our units.
I made the mold of Donner at Tunney's apartment.
they told me that there was an undercover sting, and then,
Donner had a heart attack on Friday and died, and if he didn't show up at a drop on Sunday, then, a year and a half of undercover investigation would have been, you know, wasted.
commander Tunney was gonna wear the mask and make the drop?
do you know where the commander is now?
no, I haven't seen him since I gave him the mask Sunday morning.
thank you, Miles.
Yeah. - Yeah. Gibbs.
boss, Commander Tunney was wearing the mask.
Oh, he wasn't at his apartment. We tracked him to Indian Head. We're almost at the base.
we're still in his building.
we'll check his office upstairs.
all right, we'll meet you there.
so, Commander Tunney got into the Pentagon's parking lot with Donner's car.
then he used Donner's clearance and face to gain access to the restricted file room.
I mean, what's so important to go through all that trouble?
what do you think Miles would charge to make a mask of Gibbs?
I wouldn't go there.
you're in enough trouble with him already.
you smell that?
what?
cologne.
it's Tunney's!
boss, the old man! It's Tunney.
go.
you go to the left.
give me an excuse.
you think you would've got through Customs with that disguise?
I have before.
we can place you in the Pentagon wearing the Donner mask.
got you cold for the death of Lieutenant Lauren Ross.
we know about the covert op in Kandahar. Things get out of hand?
you're being investigated for the death of a tribal leader.
you denied being in the area.
you lied, Commander.
it was easy to narrow down what we were looking for in the Command Center file room, once we knew it was you.
this op report places you 100 miles from the village the night the tribal leader was killed.
it's got your fingerprints all over it.
I wrote it.
Yeah, but problem is, there are no other prints on the report.
not your C. O.who supposedly read it, or a clerk who would have filed the report.
you substituted this report for the original, the one that would have placed you in the village.
Donner was going to make the switch because you saved his life, but he had a heart attack, so, you had to go in, wearing the Donner mask.
this was all about a cover-up?
your own words were going to hang you.
I was protecting my unit.
we were doing our jobs.
it's a dirty job no one else wants to do.
brass needs intel. No one cares how we get it until something goes wrong.
tribal leader got killed.
things happen.
sometimes there's collateral damage.
Yeah. Like Lieutenant Lauren Ross.
interesting theory.
highly unlikely.
let's give it a shot.
what's the Autopsy Gremlin up to, hmm?
all righty, here we go.
you want the honor, Special Agent Barrett?
no. You do it.
called the Port-to-Port Killer. M. O.'s the same every time.
my killer, my case. - This is for you.
I didn't order that.
no, you do it.
your eyeball, how come it opens up restricted areas at NCIS?
Port-to-Port Killer-- as you've dubbed him-- has a name.
lieutenant Jonas Cobb.
Oh, Mike.
be on high alert.
Cobb is armed and likely anticipates your arrival.
Ah, man... I got it, Cade. Lie still.
Where's EJ?
Cobb took her.
DiNozzo, come back here. Stay with him.
keep pressure on it.
I got it.
just hang in there.
you're gonna be all right.
drink this.
boss, I adjusted the BOLO on the P2P based on Agent Barrett's latest description.
get an update on Cade?
he's in surgery.
Abby's at the hospital, waiting.
Levin's next-of-kin.
agents from the Great Lakes field office are with his family in Chicago.
Ducky and Palmer are on their way up with the remains now.
I ran the phone number that Cobb keyed into the sedan.
I. D.'s blocked.
it's a secure government line.
well, unsecure it, McGee.
whoever it belongs to has a significant clearance level.
I'm having trouble cracking it.
that's Ray's cell phone number.
where is he?
I'm not sure. We have not spoken.
well, find him. Warn him. Tell him to protect his ass.
Cobb became a monster.
Yes, Director?
get me SECNAV. - Right away, sir.
he used a marker instead of a blade. It'll come off.
come on. You're gonna hurt yourself.
why didn't he kill me?
I fought like hell. But why didn't he do it right there?
you were a message, not a victim.
consider yourself lucky.
Levin's dead.
Cade may not make it. They were my responsibility. Where exactly is the luck in that?
you think Gibbs would have let Cobb leave Europe?
you think any of this would have happened if anybody else had been leading the case?
stop beating yourself up.
we've all lost people in the field.
you're a good agent. - Am I?
you're letting Cobb get inside your head, EJ, and that's exactly what he wants.
you gotta stop.
Tony, he's not doing this 'cause he wants to.
Cobb's doing this because he has to.
okay, Duck.
based on Agent Barrett's detailed description of the gun and the shell casings retrieved at the scene,
Cobb was almost certainly using Mike Franks' sidearm.
precision shot.
the Port-to-Port Killer is proving as accomplished with a gun as he is with a surgical blade.
why the change in method?
cause it's no longer about method or clue trail or gamesmanship, Mr. Palmer.
it's about hurting those responsible for putting him in this situation.
situation?
operation Frankenstein.
set aside your preconceived notions about what drives a serial killer.
what was once about profiling Cobb, his training as a medic-- his mastery of the scalpel, his dressing his younger victims as older officers
all that has evolved into clearheaded self-awareness.
those who created him must now pay.
Oh, Agent Barrett.
please, come in.
I didn't mean to interrupt. I just keep thinking about Levin.
you want someone to drive you home, Barrett?
maybe you can get some rest.
I'm fine, really.
I... But before Dr. Mallard begins the autopsy, I'd like a moment to pay my respects.
Mr. Palmer.
I've tried everything.
ray's not answering.
did you talk to his boss? - He said he was working and the assignment is classified.
well, they must be able to get in touch with him.
I don't like this.
I mean, Cobb knows that Ray is on this case.
he blames the Navy and the CIA for what has happened.
I blame the one-eyed tea bag. He's the one who screwed this up.
I'm worried.
we'll find him.
good morning, Mr. Secretary.
like hell it is, Leon.
this better be damn important.
agent's dead, Mr. Secretary.
another critical.
I don't know how much more important it could get.
right this way, sir.
McGee, what are you doing here?
waiting for you.
how's Cade?
stable, sort of.
I mean, he's lost a lot of blood.
well, he's a big guy. He's got a lot of blood to lose.
did you stay with him all night?
he's a friend, McGee.
I would do that for any friend. For you or for Tony, for Gibbs.
I know you would.
and listen, it's okay if you two are more than friends.
I understand, seriously.
I really like Cade, and I can understand how a man of his stature could be intriguing to a woman...
are you for real right now, McGee? Really?
because I am, like, over the top tired and I'm hoping this is all some sort of weird dream.
I'm not a dream.
well, that's too bad because right now I'd like to just roll over and dream about purple kittens or-or flying elephants or...
just... Never mind.
I need to go home.
where are you going?
going with you.
as long as Cobb is still on the loose, we're not taking any chances.
no, McGee, shoo. I can take care of myself.
Abby, this is not just another random suspect.
this guy is very bad news. And if something ever happened to you, I would...
you'd what, McGee?
I know what it's like to lose a team member.
especially one you care deeply for.
you learn there is no rhyme or reason to dying.
good or bad, it's just completely out of your hands.
agent Levin died because I screwed up.
no, Agent Levin died because it was his time.
there was nothing you could do about it.
excuse me. David. Yes, Tony.
where?
can you please send it over?
no, I'm not going to wait for you.
ray is apparently at a hotel in D. C. Kort gave us the address.
I'll come with you.
that's not a good idea.
I could use the fresh air.
EJ, I'm going to see my boyfriend.
can you please tell McGee that Agent Cruz will not be needing the safe house after all.
he will be staying with me instead.
ray, it's me. Open up.
ray, come on, we need to talk.
I was beginning to think you didn't...
look, Leon, I'm as unhappy about what's happened as you are.
but you can manage this.
can I? - Damn right.
how many years we been doing this together?
too long.
before you, Jenny had to clean up messes a lot worse than this one.
director Shepard had her share of problems, sir, but one thing has nothing to do with the other.
my point is it comes with the territory.
now if you're reaching your saturation level, well, that's a bigger conversation.
this isn't just about me, sir.
then what are we talking about?
Mr. Secretary, year after year I've caught whatever was thrown my way.
but since Eli David was here, since I got hurt, things have been different.
different how?
you need time, Leon? For God's sake, take all the time you need.
I'm not talking about time, sir, I'm talking about mistakes.
now you learn to accept a lot with this job.
resolutions that I knew were wrong.
and now we're facing the consequences.
we can't talk about this here.
you know that.
we need a SCIF. It's a black op.
modifications were made, sir.
we can talk all we want. The room's tight as a drum.
too many years of lightin' up "finally caught up with me, probie.
for three decades I outran every bullet aimed at me.
can't outrun this.
not with these lungs.
only got a few months left to go, and I plan to live 'em.
never one to disappoint, were you, Mike?
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
boss, it's me... - DiNozzo, slow down.
DiNozzo, talk to me.
Ziva went to find Ray.
I got a 20 on Cruz from Agent Eye-patch.
well, he should know. - That's what I thought.
location?
northrop Hotel, 27th and M.
she went there to bring Ray back to her place.
thought it would be safer. - Is there a problem?
the problem is, I haven't checked in yet.
I was on assignment. I just got back to D. C. an hour ago.
where is Ziva? - I really don't know, sir.
can't find her. Tried her home and cell.
I knew I shouldn't have let her go alone. - This is not your responsibility.
Kort lied. - No, he didn't.
his information was accurate.
who else had access to your travel plans, Cruz?
my itinerary's classified, sir.
classified never stopped Cobb before.
what if he got there first?
DiNozzo, BOLO out on Ziva. McGee, get me Kort.
boss, he's already in the building.
it's been a long time, Mr. Secretary.
we weren't supposed to see each other again.
per your request.
I certainly wish that were the case.
Oh, Leon, do we have to talk about this again?
am I boring you, Kort?
you know I have a limited attention span.
well, let me see if I can keep it interesting for you.
here's what your boy Cobb just did to one of my men.
I trained him to kill, Director.
selection is entirely his decision.
do you remember when this operation was conceived?
like it was yesterday.
your clever notion, I believe.
scribbled on a note pad during your days at the war college.
who knew it would become a joint venture between the Navy and the CIA?
it was flawed from the get-go. It should have been aborted.
it was conceptually brilliant. The results were generally positive.
except Kort lost control of one of his men.
it wasn't from lack of trying.
Cobb was strong-willed.
got a taste for killing. You pushed him.
you used him on assignments outside of the program.
with approval.
those who needed to know did.
and now somebody has to take the heat.
special Agents Barrett and Gibbs have failed to stop him.
you can't blame them.
Mr. Secretary, for once the weight does not fall on the bottom of the pyramid.
this operation was your call.
accept it.
Pam, is he in here?
sir, we're in SCIF mode.
you don't have clearance.
excuse me.
Leon. We need to talk. - Not now, Gibbs.
is Trent Kort in there with you?
agent Gibbs, this meeting requires access beyond your need to know.
I need to know if he sent one of my people into a trap.
Ziva went to meet Ray Cruz at his hotel, and he wasn't there yet.
and now she's missing.
Gibbs, all I did was provide your team with Cruz's location.
well, we think Cobb got her.
you think I sent her in there on purpose?
to gain what, exactly?
if she gets hurt, you answer to me.
is he threatening me, Director?
if he wasn't, I am.
what do you mean the security camera's not working?
I told you, Tony, the system's down all over the hotel. It has been for days.
isn't that illegal? - Same M. O. No fingerprints.
the place has been wiped clean.
how could she just walk out of here and nobody notices?
Tony. - Sorry.
we're all worried about Ziva.
I know. It's just different for some of us.
I think you people are looking for me.
this isn't right. It's too easy.
he knows where Ziva is. There's nothing easy about it.
Cobb's playing us.
playing Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
guy must have a death wish.
what does he want?
rule 16: If someone thinks they have the upper hand, break it.
something funny?
I mean, you're so confident.
so proud.
nothing to be proud of. You gave yourself up. Why?
well, because most of my work is done.
most?
agent Gibbs, are you incapable of savoring a moment?
nothing to savor. Yet.
one of my team is still missing.
where is she?
it's time to put Samson down.
you don't know about Samson, do you?
surely Agent Barrett wrote about him in that, that psych profile she holds so near and dear?
I'm listening.
once there was a boy whose father was in the Navy.
he was a captain, with enough bravery and determination to make up for his son's obvious shortcomings.
one day, the young man turned to the captain for help.
you see, his aging horse, Samson, was sick, and a decision needed to be made.
now, the boy knew that a visit from the vet meant putting the animal down.
which was the right and humane thing to do.
but what kind of lesson would that be for the boy to learn?
so the captain drew his sidearm.
fired... point blank.
put poor Samson out of his misery.
would you like me to put you out of your misery, Cobb?
your agent is still out there, Gibbs.
now, what kind of lesson would you learn if my actions were humane?
you failed as a Navy officer.
you were an embarrassment to the CIA.
a disappointment to your dad.
and you want to teach me a lesson?
where is she?
who's holding the sidearm now?
tell me what you know.
Kort oversaw two divisions.
the first one was a legitimate covert squad operating under the auspices of the Agency.
operation Frankenstein.
now, the second one was a team designed for, uh, the private sector.
hit men. - Guns for hire.
used mostly by rich, foreign politicos with targets on their backs, you understand?
who collected the profits? - I can't tell you that.
what I will tell you is that Kort skimmed enough off the top to retire.
and do you think Cobb would have turned himself in the way he did unless he was after something very specific?
something he could only find right here at NCIS?
have you gone bloody mad?!
what does Cobb really want?
you have no idea how high this goes. - I know all about Operation Frankenstein.
you don't know anything.
certain people had a lot to gain from this project.
I need to find Ziva.
stop looking for a straight line, DiNozzo!
if this were a chess game, think four moves ahead.
it's all about the checkmate.
he's clever that way.
Abbs? You okay?
the blood on Cobb's hands...
it's Ziva's.
it does not mean that she's gone.
you find anything on Cobb's clothes?
um... There's concrete dust from the ground where Cade and Levin were shot...
that's no big surprise.
but I found some weird trace elements on his pants.
there was dead bluegrass, and sheet-metal rust and some homeopathic oils.
it was, uh, arnica, and butcher's broom and bitterwort.
Bitterwort?
Yeah. Also known as gentian.
it aids in muscle aches in older people.
what if they weren't people?
remember: positive.
start talking, McGee.
Abby forwarded the chemical breakdowns she found on Cobb's clothing.
any link to a horse named Samson?
all the oils are used in over-the-counter liniments.
for horses to keep their muscles limber... - Yeah. Yeah, McGee. I know what they are.
pull up location of the Cobb family farm in Maryland.
captain Lowell Cobb bought the horse farm in Burtonsville 22 years ago.
when he died, he and Jonas hadn't spoken in years.
the land fell into disarray and was auctioned off later.
go. Find DiNozzo. And Ray Cruz.
you think Ziva's there?
Yeah. You can bet the farm on it.
road trip.
if you don't mind, Gibbs, I'd like to come.
got orders from upstairs. They want you benched. - Who?
I'm not supposed to talk about it. - Talk about what, Gibbs?
I know that your uncle is SECNAV.
I have since day one.
that's supposed to be confidential.
I gotta know my team, Barrett.
is there anything else you want to tell me?
with all due respect, I've worked hard to get here.
I earned Rota. And my personal relationship to the Secretary had nothing to do with it.
I never said it did.
all clear! - Nothing here, boss.
looks totally abandoned.
heads up...
Ziva... You all right?
I'm all right.
hiding me is a decoy, Gibbs.
get her up. - It's a distraction.
Cobb needed to keep you occupied. - Why?
he surrendered because he needed to get inside NCIS.
it is the only way he can get close to the man he holds responsible.
close to who? Vance?
SECNAV.- Davenport's got 24-hour security.
Yeah, well, his niece, Special Agent Barrett, doesn't.
uh... Agent Barrett, I was just, uh... just coming up to see you.
beat you to it, Palmer. We were on our way down before taking Cobb to lock-up.
get B2.
Yeah, I'll be real quick.
fastest DNA swab in the East.
did I hear you're getting married?
Yes. In the spring.
her name is Breena.
Yeah. Yeah...
round two, Barrett.
we're going to the M. E. van.
we're taking a drive.
update?
cameras showed Cobb forced EJ and Palmer to take him to the autopsy garage.
security said that Palmer signed out the M. E. van.
so the guards didn't think twice about checking it.
agent was rushed to the E. R. with a concussion and a broken nose, but he's all right.
both Palmer and EJ's cell phones have been disabled, so GPS tracking is inoperable.
Bolos? - Went out to the FBI and Metro P. D.
and the Agency's on it, too.
Davenport? - SECNAV's been called and is on his way.
uncle SECNAV. She could have mentioned that.
maybe she did not want you to think less of her.
I know what it's like to have a relative in a place of power.
it can... influence things.
we'll find them.
how do we know this plan is going to work?
we don't, Mr. Secretary.
Cobb had the chance to hurt Special Agent Barrett once, sir.
he didn't, as a message to you.
he wanted to show you how humane he could be.
he had to get your attention.
he used EJ as bait.
found this in Autopsy.
we'll be waiting at home.
at home, Leon. - The building.
where Cade and Levin were hit.
it's where the Frankenstein training occurred.
there's nothing left of it. - There is for Cobb, sir.
he's going back to where it all started.
I may have conceived of this project, but the Secretary dictated its actions.
certain jobs were accepted that neither the CIA nor the Navy officially authorized.
then why order them?
off-the-record political favors.
I was smart enough to steer clear.
Kort handled the private jobs.
well, who's handling Kort?
mistakes were made, gentlemen.
doesn't mean more people have to die.
I'm giving my resignation to the President as soon as this is over.
let's take care of this son of a bitch.
Cobb, you hear me?
what the hell are you doing, Lieutenant?
training.
to do what, exactly?
well, as my teacher Officer Kort once said...
...we had to maintain composure under the most arduous situations.
tried to kill him, sir.
agent Kort made the mistake of trying to stop me himself.
those who can't do, teach.
you know... I've actually admired your niece's tenacity for some time.
she's a good agent.
beautiful girl.
of course, her connection to you is why I started in Rota.
to make sure we ended together.
well, surely, you didn't come alone, Mr. Secretary?
we came to arrest you, Cobb.
drop the weapon.
it's not that easy, Gibbs.
don't do it.
you know... I thought I was being trained to do what was right.
drop the gun, Lieutenant.
we can talk about this.
we want to help you.
liar.
so, what's next? Rota?
Cade's been reassigned stateside.
Oh, stateside as in local, Simon?
no, McGee.
stateside as in Bremerton, Washington.
I'm gonna spend some time with my family while things heal.
that's good.
very sorry to see you go, of course.
Yeah, right.
so you're putting together a new team, or what?
I'm giving up my post, too, Tony.
need some time to decide what's next.
you can have Rota, if you want.
I think I'll stay put.
no sense walking away from a good thing.
that a compliment, DiNozzo?
no, boss. Sorry. Never.
I'm thinking about sticking around D. C. for a while.
Really? Were you?
it's a real small town, you know.
maybe, uh, we'll bump into each other sometime.
it's possible.
thank you, Erica Jane Barrett.
for everything.
see you, Gibbs.
it's been real.
come back anytime, Special Agent Barrett.
maybe I will.
it's empty.
you disappointed?
well, I know what I would like better.
consider it a promise.
what kind of promise?
that we have lots to talk about when I get back.
I have to work outside of the country.
for how long?
it could take a while.
then don't go. Stay.
I can't.
well, tell them that I threatened to divorce you.
they know I'm not married.
well, if you keep doing this, you'll never be.
come here.
is this good-bye?
for now.
how do I know?
you gave me an empty box.
I gave you a promise.
what is it?
nothing.
ready! Aim! Fire!
ready! Aim! Fire!
ready! Aim! Fire!
present arms!
having you here as the new SECNAV, Clay, is a heck of a surprise.
tell me about it, Leon.
when the President called to offer me the job, I was convinced it was a prank.
people are excited to have you.
well, I'm happy to be here. You still box?
Oh, once in a while. I can't take a beating the way I used to.
Oh, try working on the Hill as a lobbyist, 247.
that wasn't a beating, it was a massacre.
so what can I do for you?
what's our first order of business?
first, promise to protect my ass as long as it's your sworn duty as NCIS director.
easy enough. What else?
special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
I've already been in touch with him.
mind if I bring him in?
you've spoken to Agent DiNozzo?
twice, I think.
may I?
agent DiNozzo, sit down.
sir. Director.
director Vance, I'm authorizing Agent DiNozzo access to sensitive compartmented information commensurate with the Black Program.
none of your other team members need to know. Is that clear?
actually, Clay, I'm a little concerned.
secretary Jarvis when we're talking shop.
so...
an agent, somewhere in your organization, is selling top-secret information, and they need to be dealt with appropriately.
Mr. Secretary, I'd like to discuss this first.
there's nothing else to talk about.
if you're uncomfortable with this, Agent DiNozzo and I can do it without you.
take a look.
that's who you're handling.
do whatever it takes.
any questions?
Bye, Mike.
Ziva, I have to work outside the country.
for how long?
before Dr. Mallard begins the autopsy, I'd like a moment to pay my respects.
I'm giving my resignation to the president as soon as this is over.
Dr. Vance, I'm authorizing Agent DiNozzo access to sensitive, compartmented information.
none of your other team members need to know. Is that clear?
actually, Clay, I'm a little concerned.
secretary Jarvis" when we're talking shop.
take a look.
that's who you're handling.
Hey, I came as soon as I could.
Yeah, sorry it's late.
status?
he was found unconscious.
single gunshot wound to the chest, concussion.
I assume he defended himself.
got off two rounds.
so he shot the son of a bitch?
maybe.
what does "maybe" mean? - Maybe means maybe.
there was a lot of blood left behind.
the shooter's body was gone.
you want me to talk to him? - Yeah.
Gibbs, not that I don't love a good monosyllabic conversation.
it's oddly endearing. It's just that it's after midnight, I'm a little fuzzy.
talk to him about what?
you're the doc, Doc.
I got you some coffee.
Dr. Kate's, uh... sister, huh?
surprise, surprise.
what are you doing here?
can I get you something from the bar?
little, uh, appletini, or lime Jell-O shots?
those are good.
well, it's good to see you haven't lost your sense of humor, Agent DiNozzo.
I thought you said he was shot.
Yeah. I didn't say they were successful.
I'm gonna let you two talk.
DiNozzo, I'll get your clothes.
thank you, boss.
so, you're okay?
I'm not dead.
looks like the vest saved your life.
you could say I'm well-invested.
invest we trust.
go vest, young man.
you fired two rounds from your gun.
casings were recovered, slugs weren't.
there was blood at the scene, but no body.
I ain't got nobody.
are you done?
done with what?
the nervous responses.
I guess I'm a little...
rattled.
acknowledgment is the first step to recovery.
we're making some progress.
so, who'd you shoot, Agent DiNozzo?
you got pizza, boss?
something wrong?
it's not yours.
you shot another NCIS agent?
I... uh...
I need your help.
I don't know.
I... can't remember any of it.
sure you should be walking around, DiNozzo?
he hasn't stopped fidgeting since I got here.
I do have some stuff on my mind.
there's an epiphany.
I remember...I had orders.
from whom?
SECNAV. - I didn't ask you.
I'm trying to help here.
you can't remember who the badge belongs to?
I have no idea.
is the rest of your team accounted for, Gibbs?
it's the middle of the night. I'm still waiting for answers.
you discharged your weapon at someone, Tony.
that's not to be taken lightly.
who was it?
I'd tell you if I could.
he's blocked it.
short-term memory loss is a protective response to trauma.
we know Agent DiNozzo has killed before, but if he ended the life of another NCIS agent, someone close, in addition to the concussion, that would explain the lapse.
it's temporary.
most likely.
sorry, boss. I...was following orders.
not following my orders.
that's not fair, Gibbs.
it's the truth.
you know, Agent DiNozzo and I need a little time alone.
would you mind?
Hey, knock yourself out.
no pun intended.
okay, now, where were we?
tell me about your assignment.
from the beginning.
you ever play golf before, DiNozzo?
of course, Mr. Secretary.
Yeah, you know, as a kid with my...
with my father, on holiday.
that explains a lot.
it's a game about patience. Taking every element into account.
just when you think you're in control, you're not.
are we gonna talk in metaphor for the rest of the round, sir?
cause, if so, I'm gonna need a few more beers.
you shoot from the hip.
you know, it's part of the reason I chose you for this assignment.
what's the other part?
you know what it takes to be a good agent.
you don't mind getting your hands dirty.
in that respect, NCIS has been good for you.
been?
well, no disrespect to Director Vance or Agent Gibbs, but we have a situation, and it's our job to deal with it.
well, I'm sure the rest of the team could be helpful, sir.
I didn't ask the rest of the team, DiNozzo.
I asked you.
you saw the photo.
you know who the problem is.
make it happen.
and did the rest of your team suspect that you were on a secret assignment?
no, not at first.
just business as usual.
another e-mail to Ray?
I know he's on a classified mission and that he is busy.
I also know that if he reads an e-mail, it could risk disclosing his location.
But?
But...just because I write them does not mean he has to read them.
unless he's on a secure system.
then they will, perhaps, make him smile.
I think I got something else that's gonna make you smile,"Ziver.
Congratulations.
you're now a journeyman agent.
my probation is officially over?
done and done.
congrats, Special Agent David.
I will carry this with tremendous pride.
carry what? Ray's stones in a Mason jar?
Aw, probie no more.
good for you.
who am I gonna pick on now?
I'm sure you will find something else to pick on me about.
in the meantime, Tony, we are now equals.
equals, huh?
careful what you ask for.
tonight we should all go out and celebrate.
you mean a wetting down?
no, there is no wedding.
I mean, Palmer's not getting married till next spring.
it's called a "wetting down," David.
means you're paying.
Oh, then we should go somewhere fun.
I know a fun gaming lounge.
3- D PS2 on a 60-inch plasma.
or not.
and what do you think, Tony?
I think I'll take a rain check. I've got some homework to do.
but, uh, you have some fun, David. You've earned it.
how's your vision, DiNozzo?
20-20, boss. Why?
Oh, Vance tells me Jarvis needs your help.
better keep your eyes open.
back of my head, as always, boss. Learned from the best.
you haven't learned everything.
I'd have told him to forget it.
what do you know about Jarvis?
smart.
seems like he means business.
you trust him?
don't we have to?
you know, I became a cop because I thought the lines were clear
good and bad, right and wrong.
let me guess: The lines blur?
funny how that happens.
you gonna tell me what's on your mind?
just doing my job, boss.
shooters, you may commence firing.
just doing my job.
walk me through what happened from the end of May to now.
I was given an order to handle a situation.
and by "handle," you mean kill someone?
if it came down to that, yeah.
taking a life is lot of responsibility.
do you consider yourself an accountable person?
very.
and yet, this happened.
how did the order present itself?
through a...Through a photograph.
of whom?
well, sweetheart, if I could remember that, we wouldn't be here, would we?
I'm not your sweetheart. Try harder.
I am trying.
I know there's probably something you're not mentioning.
try again, Tony.
I know you can.
you don't know anything about me.
Oh, actually, I know quite a lot.
from Kate...
to Jeanne Benoit to the complexities of your relationship with Agent David.
don't think I had forgotten about that kid in Baltimore, either.
I need to know what I did.
then let's start with the photo.
I des...
I destroyed it.
destroying more pictures from your dirty collection, Tony?
well, Miss Shiny New Badge of Courage, the answer to that is no.
unlike you, flashing your new badge at every Tom, Dick, and Joe Friday who's willing to look, I've been doing my job.
what job is that?
rumor has it you've been given a new assignment.
will you be traveling, too?
well, I have put in some time for my vacation.
you never know - maybe our paths will cross.
where you going?
you know, there's a new app that tells you where every Cracker Barrel in the country is.
I'm going to Central America to meet an old friend.
central America.
that's nice - the land of tropical martinis and string bikinis.
tell me, does CI Ray know about this "old friend"?
it is a woman, Tony.
she is someone very dear to me and, uh...
I need her advice.
ray has nothing to worry about.
I do not know what you are investigating...
and I do not need to know, but ever since we lost Levin and Franks and EJ left...
NCIS has been through a lot.
we have been through a lot.
we need some time.
we... as in you and me?
that's not what I meant.
Oh... well, what did you mean then, Ziva?
all I'm saying is...
look out for yourself.
please?
you must have sensed that they were concerned about you.
I'm sure they were.
everyone was in the dark, trying to put the puzzle together.
something is gnawing at me, Jethro, and as you know, I am not one to gnaw.
well, shoot, Duck. What is it?
well, you, your agents, Abby, even Director Vance - we work together as a cohesive unit.
we have no secrets from one another because there cannot be any.
that is why we succeed.
well, yeah, that's the way it works, Duck.
so?
well, I noticed something when I did Agent Levin's autopsy - a small postmortem incision made with a nonsurgical blade.
you saying that someone else cut him other than you?
I took the liberty of downloading the Autopsy security images from the day that Levin was killed.
special Agent Barrett asked for time alone with the body so she could say her good-byes.
that's a hell of a good-bye, Duck.
she cut him with her pocketknife.
Yes. It seems that EJ and you share an affinity for retractable weaponry.
she taking something out of his arm?
Yes. That's what astounded me.
agent Levin had a small microchip of some sort embedded in his arm.
any idea why?
well, that's where my expertise ends and yours begins.
timing of DiNozzo's mission could explain it.
well, you said it, not I.
why do I bother having a door?
when were you going to tell me about this thing with DiNozzo?
agent DiNozzo is following orders given directly to him by Secretary Jarvis.
he's my responsibility, Leon.
no, he's my responsibility, and if I'm willing, so are you.
how well do you know Jarvis?
I've known Clayton Jarvis for almost 20 years.
I've trusted him with my life.
people change.
I hope you're not questioning the SECNAV's authority.
Jarvis can do what he wants.
it's his navy. - It's his navy...
it's my team.
okay... he starts to turn the picture over...
there.
go two frames back.
see, that looks like a woman to me.
no, it doesn't.
it looks like a hairy pirate with a moustache.
you mean, Tony's assignment is to kill Johnny Depp?
I like Johnny Depp.
this isn't working.
well, it is too grainy, I cannot see anything.
I don't feel comfortable doing this.
I know, we're spying on family.
well, sometimes we must cross boundaries to protect those we care about.
well, hypothetically, what if Ray was Tony's target?
Okay...though I am confident it is not Ray, we should prepare ourselves for the unexpected.
I hope it isn't anyone we know.
Mr. Ambassador, it was a pleasure, and please give your wife my regards.
sir. - I look forward to seeing you...
sir. - Not now, Gibbs.
I'm going straight from here to a charity - Sir...
you're using one of my people. Call my office without my knowledge.
and schedule an appointment. - They're my people, too, Gibbs.
Yes, sir, but we function as a team.
if you remove one, everything changes.
director Vance told me to expect some push-back from you, but you're being borderline disrespectful.
that a compliment, sir?
you'll get DiNozzo back when I'm done with him.
what if he doesn't make it back?
sounds like you know more about this mission than you should, Gibbs. - No, sir,
I've just been there many times myself.
stop that car!
call an ambulance.
it's okay.
Oh, my God, Felix.
he's a friend.
well, your friend's dead, Mr. Secretary.
you think this has anything to do with it?
Mr. Palmer, what do you suppose the SECNAV is saying to them?
well, if I were him, I'd be asking how to get blood out of a $200 white dress shirt.
see, it's all about oxygenating the stain.
my mother used to use club soda, but my uncle preferred Perrier with a dash of...
um, the incision - they're probably talking about the incision.
well, it's in exactly the same location as Agent Levin's.
captain Wright was a highly decorated naval officer and a valued member of the DOD.
make this investigation a priority.
you could start with the incision in his arm.
NCIS Special Agent Levin had one, too.
there will be no discussion of Captain Wright's death with anybody outside this core group.
do I need to repeat myself?
no, sir.
your timing is impeccable.
I got the answer I was looking for.
on the DL, ask Agents McGee and David to find the thread that links Wright to Levin.
and the microchip?
I wish I knew.
did Gibbs notice you weren't at the hotel?
well, missing a crime scene never goes over well, but I was already on the mission.
what did you say to him?
I didn't.
he knew I wasn't there.
Gibbs sees everything, you know.
and where were you in your assignment at this point?
I don't know.
you know, when my mom died, we were in a room like this.
I remember 'cause there was a movie playing - Angels with Dirty Faces.
michael Curtiz.
these two kids growing up together.
bogie's priest.
Cagney...
the mobster searching for answers.
life's crossroads.
we all make decisions, some smarter than others.
pieces weren't fitting together.
I had to talk to Agent Barrett.
Why? She the one in the photograph?
the thing about chasing a federal agent - they know how to disappear.
she was careful about not leaving a paper trail.
not careful enough.
kiawah Island, huh?
nice. Beachy.
Hello, Tony, how are you?
working. Looks like you are, too.
there's someone I need to see - friend of a friend.
is it about the microchip you took out of Levin's arm?
we need to talk.
I can't, not till I get back.
I don't know what you're mixed up in, but people are looking for you, okay?
people who don't have the same personal investment as yours truly.
I made a promise to someone, Tony, and now I need to fulfill it.
I made a promise to someone, too - a promise I fully intend to keep.
you took something, EJ, something that's causing people a lot of concern.
is that why you're here? - And they want it back.
it's not mine to give.
you have an option here, but you have to trust me.
and what if I can't?
then I can't help you.
while I was getting deeper into my assignment, I knew Gibbs wouldn't be letting up, trying to figure out what Wright and Levin had in common.
anything, McGee?
uh, plenty.
after weeks of navigating red tape,
I think I finally got through the government firewall connecting Levin to Wright.
Yeah. And...?
both men used to be Office of Naval Intel.
oni isn't in Levin's file.
all the details were redacted.
both apparently worked for the Director of Special Operations, a civilian named Sean Latham.
Latham leads a secret armada of spy vessels called the Watcher Fleet.
watchers are loaded with billions in surveillance.
they constantly are monitoring terrorist and anti-military activity.
spying on the spies.
after their time at ONI, Agent Levin was transferred here, and Captain Wright went to the Pentagon.
gotta wonder what's on those microchips.
Yeah.
and who'd kill for 'em.
is this what Tony's wrapped up in?
special Agent Gibbs?
Yeah. What can I do for you?
agent Stratton, FBI.
busy night, huh?
burning the wick at both ends.
Yeah, that's what coffee's for.
can I help you with something, Stratton?
Yeah. Uh, Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
we got wind he may have been involved in an altercation with another federal agent.
can you verify that?
no.
well, is Agent DiNozzo a patient in this hospital or not?
well, being a patient doesn't mean he did anything wrong.
well... we'll be the judge of that.
no, you won't.
anything happened, this case would have been handed over to my IG for a 2B investigation.
I want to talk to him.
there was an accident.
he had a head injury.
I heard he was shot.
man, I tell you, you're just chock full of all kinds of bad information, Stratton.
go home.
sorry you got out of bed.
so, what happened after she decided to leave with you?
she was being evasive, and I needed answers.
people know you took the microchip. Why?
because Levin told me to.
because if anything happened to him, I swore I'd get it to the right person before it fell into the wrong hands.
what's on it?
I honestly have no idea.
you're lying. - All I did was make a promise.
to who? The highest bidder? Is that what this is about? You're selling information?
who were you going to see?
no one.
I need to know the truth, EJ.
navy Captain Felix Wright.
he's been out of the country.
no. He's dead.
go! Get in the car, EJ! Go!
stay down!
did you see 'em?
how many?
hold on.
so Barrett was the one in the photo.
the traitor.
I didn't say that.
they wanted their chip back.
Barrett took it.
they tried to kill her.
they were shooting at both of us.
you're defending her.
EJ...needed my help.
why do you think you keep getting involved with dysfunctional women?
What?!
well, the women you date are, well...
messed up.
I date all kinds of women.
you know, I think you're drawn to them because you want to help them.
I am drawn to them because, usually, they're pretty hot.
Tony, admit it.
you like hot girls who carry guns.
who doesn't like hot girls who carry guns?
which brings us back to Agent Barrett.
of course it does.
Oh, I see what you did there.
that was tricky.
you really like these head games, don't you?
you did that on purpose.
anger releases endorphins, and endorphins can jog all sorts of memories.
in the case file, Jarvis gave me some information about...
...microchips.
now that we know about Wright and Levin's Naval Intel connection, I did a little digging of my own.
when implanted under the flesh, microchips can leave behind metal hydride corrosion.
high-tech rust.
look what I figured out.
that it hurt.
well, yeah, but based on the level of metallic decomp Ducky found,
I was able to determine that the chips were implanted at approximately the same time.
both in the left arm, both in the same position, and both functioning as low-emitting radiofrequency I. D. tags.
they were access chips.
electronic door-openers.
Gibbs, this is Sean Latham, ONI's Director of the Watcher Fleet.
I didn't know if you guys really existed.
flesh and blood.
normally, we wouldn't be discussing an ONI program, but we have a situation.
and I just lost a dear friend. Sean?
Gayne Levin and Felix Wright worked for me as a part of a program called Phantom Eight
an eight-man squad that tried to preemptively influence international acts of terrorism.
stop 'em before they happen.
each operative was tagged with a microchip, a pass key, giving them access, worldwide, to the Watcher database.
wave your arm over a secure laptop, download classified information our enemies would pay top dollar for.
when Levin was killed, ONI's intention was to remove his chip immediately.
unfortunately, one of your agents got to him first.
and you think Agent Barrett is in it to make a profit?
we don't want to risk finding out.
why are you sharing this with me?
we now believe she's working internally...
with someone else.
you want to know who.
we're already looking, Gibbs.
find her, find the stolen microchips.
it's a matter of national security.
Hi, Gibbs.
boss, we need your help.
after you cook dinner.
so, I'm sitting there, and I'm...
you know, I'm on my third tequila.
I'm not in good shape, and Franks is, like, 12 sheets to the wind, when all of a sudden, the door swings open, and standing there are the three deadliest drug dealers in all of Mexico, and you know what Franks does? He turns to the bartender, and he says...
cervezas for my amigos.
if I'm dead, put it on my tab, probie.
his family's here now.
it's good to have 'em close.
you know what you got there, Barrett?
Nope.
I don't want to, either.
you were supposed to give it to Wright.
now what do we do?
figure out who it belongs to?
you think?
you don't trust anyone, do you, Gibbs?
Yeah, I do.
I just make 'em earn it.
the only people I trusted were the men on my team.
well...
I'm starting to worry about the big guy in all of this.
Cade? - Yeah.
Why?
Cade and Levin were tight.
maybe he knew too much.
get him back here.
you in contact?
not since we left.
try.
so that's when you realized you couldn't do this alone?
I trust these people with my life.
like family.
no. Not my family.
my family is...
way less dependable.
you should meet my father sometime. It would explain a lot.
I'd like that.
he'd like that, too, I think.
NCIS is...
part of who I am.
and yet you took an assignment that resulted in the death of another agent...
the very people you say you trust with your life?
you're contradicting yourself.
wouldn't be the first time.
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?
who are you?
didn't Gibbs tell you I was here?
I'm Agent Stratton, FBI.
I apologize.
I - I didn't realize Agent DiNozzo was with anyone.
and you are...?
his doctor.
look at me, interrupting with a doctor's work.
I'm just so glad to see you're alive, Agent DiNozzo.
Thanks.
it's a miracle, really, and thank heaven.
well, you and I can talk later, if that's all right with you, Doc.
I'm calling Agent Gibbs.
now is clearly the wrong time.
the doctor is in, so I'm out.
take care of yourself, pal.
okay?
so, Tony...
what happened next?
well, I knew it was time to resurface, time to come in and see what surfaced with me.
here you go.
Tony, you've been off the grid for weeks.
you miss me, McWorry-wart?
I was busy doing my job.
well, we were concerned.
we?
I see.
Yes, Tony, I expressed curiosity.
even though you're more than capable of taking care of yourself.
you and Ray are cut from the same quilt.
cloth.
Oh, don't interrupt her, boss - she's on a roll.
of course.
makes total sense...
since EJ's the one you are after.
she's the one in the photograph, is she not?
you know I can't answer that.
McGee. Somebody help.
route my cell phone to the plasma.
tapping into the WiFi now.
it's Cade. He just sent me this message.
something's happened. He is in trouble.
you gotta help me, Abb.
I don't know what to do here.
someone's after me.
I just spoke to Fornell about Agent Stratton.
know him?
doc, can you give us a minute?
all right.
I'll go get my sixth cup of coffee for the evening.
lightweight.
ruin all my hard work and I'll kill you.
copy that.
brass from your weapon. We found it in the alley.
I told you, boss, I...
just shut up and listen, DiNozzo.
Abby's running DNA from spatter found at the scene.
in addition to your blood, there were two other types found.
two?
three people altogether, DiNozzo.
I know this is hard, but I need to know who you were handling.
great playing with you, Brian.
all right. I'll see you again.
been waiting long, DiNozzo?
permission to speak candidly, Mr. Secretary?
go for it.
this mission blows.
Oh, I'm sorry you're disappointed.
rule number one in Washington politics - don't take work personally.
I know a few rules, too, sir.
such as?
rule number three: Never believe what you're told.
what are you insinuating?
rule number five: Don't waste good.
in other words, I'm wasting your precious time?
and then, of course, there's my favorite - rule number 36:
if you feel like you're being played, you probably are.
what do you want?
I want you to take me off this assignment.
I can't do that.
I feel like I'm too close.
that's the sacrifice.
nature of the beast.
people are getting hurt- people I care about- and I'm not asking you, sir, I'm telling you.
you take me off this assignment or I resign from NCIS.
that felt like a threat.
you want to hear my second rule?
sure.
don't screw with me.
I own you.
know it, accept it.
it comes with the detail.
you gonna give me another speech about patience, maybe throw in a golf metaphor?
sure.
you're OB, Agent DiNozzo.
now, get lost before you say something you can't back out of.
I hope you play better than you negotiate.
spare me the criticism.
he seems to be handling things worse than you predicted.
he'll come around.
maybe.
maybe not.
they never saw it coming.
she was blindsided.
she?
Hey, Eej.
Oh, God, I thought for sure you were dead.
Oh, your hands are freezing.
let's go. There's a diner down the street. We can...
wait.
are you all right?
since I got shot, life has been different.
I can't work, and now I'm being chased and I have no idea why.
you sold out, Cade.
step away from him, EJ.
watch the hands.
well, tell her, big guy, go ahead.
tell her.
you know all about the microchip.
you already killed Captain Wright.
so, what, now you want to get your hands on Levin's, too?
what are you saying, DiNozzo?
Hey!
I got a message from EJ to come to DC.
next thing I know, I'm being hunted, and then she sends me a text to, to meet her here.
I never texted you.
EJ, who told you to come here tonight?
I thought you did.
the text said we should all meet here.
I got the same message.
you said I fired my gun.
what about the badge in my pocket?
metro found Cade's body along the Potomac.
the badge was his.
what about the gunshot wounds?
duck said the fatal shot was from another weapon.
shots from your gun were all postmortem.
so, what, they...
they planted the badge...
to make it look like I killed him?
EJ.
still looking.
Tony, you never fired.
you didn't kill them.
DiNozzo, the photo was always Cade.
you saw the photo.
you know who the problem is.
make it happen.
Yeah, I knew EJ didn't do it, but I needed her help to bring Cade in.
SECNAV was positive it was him.
I had to convince her to reach out and draw him back to DC.
well, it worked.
when EJ took the microchip...
the doors opened.
we were all used.
someone wanted those chips.
you saw the shooter, Tony, in that alley.
who was it?
he killed them.
lot of blood was shed.
gentlemen, I intend to find out who Casey Stratton really is.
bureau doesn't know him.
they tried to kill DiNozzo once.
they went to the hospital to finish the job.
we got stills from hospital security, but he hasn't turned up on any database.
I want to know how this son of a bitch knew about the microchips.
the mission was always Cade.
this was not supposed to happen.
agent DiNozzo is alive, Mr. Secretary.
guess you got lucky.
I guess we did.
Congratulations.
you, too, sir.
things turned out for the best.
Jarvis is none the wiser.
happy to oblige.
the girl still missing?
unfortunately.
find her.
I will.
now, then, shall we get down to business?
gentlemen.
who would like to start the bidding?
Bye, Mike.
Ziva, I have to work outside the country.
for how long?
before Dr. Mallard begins the autopsy, I'd like a moment to pay my respects.
I'm giving my resignation to the president as soon as this is over.
Dr. Vance, I'm authorizing Agent DiNozzo access to sensitive, compartmented information.
none of your other team members need to know. Is that clear?
actually, Clay, I'm a little concerned.
secretary Jarvis" when we're talking shop.
take a look.
that's who you're handling.
Hey, I came as soon as I could.
Yeah, sorry it's late.
status?
he was found unconscious.
single gunshot wound to the chest, concussion.
I assume he defended himself.
got off two rounds.
so he shot the son of a bitch?
maybe.
what does "maybe" mean? - Maybe means maybe.
there was a lot of blood left behind.
the shooter's body was gone.
you want me to talk to him? - Yeah.
Gibbs, not that I don't love a good monosyllabic conversation.
it's oddly endearing. It's just that it's after midnight, I'm a little fuzzy.
talk to him about what?
you're the doc, Doc.
I got you some coffee.
Dr. Kate's, uh... sister, huh?
surprise, surprise.
what are you doing here?
can I get you something from the bar?
little, uh, appletini, or lime Jell-O shots?
those are good.
well, it's good to see you haven't lost your sense of humor, Agent DiNozzo.
I thought you said he was shot.
Yeah. I didn't say they were successful.
I'm gonna let you two talk.
DiNozzo, I'll get your clothes.
thank you, boss.
so, you're okay?
I'm not dead.
looks like the vest saved your life.
you could say I'm well-invested.
invest we trust.
go vest, young man.
you fired two rounds from your gun.
casings were recovered, slugs weren't.
there was blood at the scene, but no body.
I ain't got nobody.
are you done?
done with what?
the nervous responses.
I guess I'm a little...
rattled.
acknowledgment is the first step to recovery.
we're making some progress.
so, who'd you shoot, Agent DiNozzo?
you got pizza, boss?
something wrong?
it's not yours.
you shot another NCIS agent?
I... uh...
I need your help.
I don't know.
I... can't remember any of it.
sure you should be walking around, DiNozzo?
he hasn't stopped fidgeting since I got here.
I do have some stuff on my mind.
there's an epiphany.
I remember...I had orders.
from whom?
SECNAV. - I didn't ask you.
I'm trying to help here.
you can't remember who the badge belongs to?
I have no idea.
is the rest of your team accounted for, Gibbs?
it's the middle of the night. I'm still waiting for answers.
you discharged your weapon at someone, Tony.
that's not to be taken lightly.
who was it?
I'd tell you if I could.
he's blocked it.
short-term memory loss is a protective response to trauma.
we know Agent DiNozzo has killed before, but if he ended the life of another NCIS agent, someone close, in addition to the concussion, that would explain the lapse.
it's temporary.
most likely.
sorry, boss. I...was following orders.
not following my orders.
that's not fair, Gibbs.
it's the truth.
you know, Agent DiNozzo and I need a little time alone.
would you mind?
Hey, knock yourself out.
no pun intended.
okay, now, where were we?
tell me about your assignment.
from the beginning.
you ever play golf before, DiNozzo?
of course, Mr. Secretary.
Yeah, you know, as a kid with my...
with my father, on holiday.
that explains a lot.
it's a game about patience. Taking every element into account.
just when you think you're in control, you're not.
are we gonna talk in metaphor for the rest of the round, sir?
cause, if so, I'm gonna need a few more beers.
you shoot from the hip.
you know, it's part of the reason I chose you for this assignment.
what's the other part?
you know what it takes to be a good agent.
you don't mind getting your hands dirty.
in that respect, NCIS has been good for you.
been?
well, no disrespect to Director Vance or Agent Gibbs, but we have a situation, and it's our job to deal with it.
well, I'm sure the rest of the team could be helpful, sir.
I didn't ask the rest of the team, DiNozzo.
I asked you.
you saw the photo.
you know who the problem is.
make it happen.
and did the rest of your team suspect that you were on a secret assignment?
no, not at first.
just business as usual.
another e-mail to Ray?
I know he's on a classified mission and that he is busy.
I also know that if he reads an e-mail, it could risk disclosing his location.
But?
But...just because I write them does not mean he has to read them.
unless he's on a secure system.
then they will, perhaps, make him smile.
I think I got something else that's gonna make you smile,"Ziver.
Congratulations.
you're now a journeyman agent.
my probation is officially over?
done and done.
congrats, Special Agent David.
I will carry this with tremendous pride.
carry what? Ray's stones in a Mason jar?
Aw, probie no more.
good for you.
who am I gonna pick on now?
I'm sure you will find something else to pick on me about.
in the meantime, Tony, we are now equals.
equals, huh?
careful what you ask for.
tonight we should all go out and celebrate.
you mean a wetting down?
no, there is no wedding.
I mean, Palmer's not getting married till next spring.
it's called a "wetting down," David.
means you're paying.
Oh, then we should go somewhere fun.
I know a fun gaming lounge.
3- D PS2 on a 60-inch plasma.
or not.
and what do you think, Tony?
I think I'll take a rain check. I've got some homework to do.
but, uh, you have some fun, David. You've earned it.
how's your vision, DiNozzo?
20-20, boss. Why?
Oh, Vance tells me Jarvis needs your help.
better keep your eyes open.
back of my head, as always, boss. Learned from the best.
you haven't learned everything.
I'd have told him to forget it.
what do you know about Jarvis?
smart.
seems like he means business.
you trust him?
don't we have to?
you know, I became a cop because I thought the lines were clear
good and bad, right and wrong.
let me guess: The lines blur?
funny how that happens.
you gonna tell me what's on your mind?
just doing my job, boss.
shooters, you may commence firing.
just doing my job.
walk me through what happened from the end of May to now.
I was given an order to handle a situation.
and by "handle," you mean kill someone?
if it came down to that, yeah.
taking a life is lot of responsibility.
do you consider yourself an accountable person?
very.
and yet, this happened.
how did the order present itself?
through a...Through a photograph.
of whom?
well, sweetheart, if I could remember that, we wouldn't be here, would we?
I'm not your sweetheart. Try harder.
I am trying.
I know there's probably something you're not mentioning.
try again, Tony.
I know you can.
you don't know anything about me.
Oh, actually, I know quite a lot.
from Kate...
to Jeanne Benoit to the complexities of your relationship with Agent David.
don't think I had forgotten about that kid in Baltimore, either.
I need to know what I did.
then let's start with the photo.
I des...
I destroyed it.
destroying more pictures from your dirty collection, Tony?
well, Miss Shiny New Badge of Courage, the answer to that is no.
unlike you, flashing your new badge at every Tom, Dick, and Joe Friday who's willing to look, I've been doing my job.
what job is that?
rumor has it you've been given a new assignment.
will you be traveling, too?
well, I have put in some time for my vacation.
you never know - maybe our paths will cross.
where you going?
you know, there's a new app that tells you where every Cracker Barrel in the country is.
I'm going to Central America to meet an old friend.
central America.
that's nice - the land of tropical martinis and string bikinis.
tell me, does CI Ray know about this "old friend"?
it is a woman, Tony.
she is someone very dear to me and, uh...
I need her advice.
ray has nothing to worry about.
I do not know what you are investigating...
and I do not need to know, but ever since we lost Levin and Franks and EJ left...
NCIS has been through a lot.
we have been through a lot.
we need some time.
we... as in you and me?
that's not what I meant.
Oh... well, what did you mean then, Ziva?
all I'm saying is...
look out for yourself.
please?
you must have sensed that they were concerned about you.
I'm sure they were.
everyone was in the dark, trying to put the puzzle together.
something is gnawing at me, Jethro, and as you know, I am not one to gnaw.
well, shoot, Duck. What is it?
well, you, your agents, Abby, even Director Vance - we work together as a cohesive unit.
we have no secrets from one another because there cannot be any.
that is why we succeed.
well, yeah, that's the way it works, Duck.
so?
well, I noticed something when I did Agent Levin's autopsy - a small postmortem incision made with a nonsurgical blade.
you saying that someone else cut him other than you?
I took the liberty of downloading the Autopsy security images from the day that Levin was killed.
special Agent Barrett asked for time alone with the body so she could say her good-byes.
that's a hell of a good-bye, Duck.
she cut him with her pocketknife.
Yes. It seems that EJ and you share an affinity for retractable weaponry.
she taking something out of his arm?
Yes. That's what astounded me.
agent Levin had a small microchip of some sort embedded in his arm.
any idea why?
well, that's where my expertise ends and yours begins.
timing of DiNozzo's mission could explain it.
well, you said it, not I.
why do I bother having a door?
when were you going to tell me about this thing with DiNozzo?
agent DiNozzo is following orders given directly to him by Secretary Jarvis.
he's my responsibility, Leon.
no, he's my responsibility, and if I'm willing, so are you.
how well do you know Jarvis?
I've known Clayton Jarvis for almost 20 years.
I've trusted him with my life.
people change.
I hope you're not questioning the SECNAV's authority.
Jarvis can do what he wants.
it's his navy. - It's his navy...
it's my team.
okay... he starts to turn the picture over...
there.
go two frames back.
see, that looks like a woman to me.
no, it doesn't.
it looks like a hairy pirate with a moustache.
you mean, Tony's assignment is to kill Johnny Depp?
I like Johnny Depp.
this isn't working.
well, it is too grainy, I cannot see anything.
I don't feel comfortable doing this.
I know, we're spying on family.
well, sometimes we must cross boundaries to protect those we care about.
well, hypothetically, what if Ray was Tony's target?
Okay...though I am confident it is not Ray, we should prepare ourselves for the unexpected.
I hope it isn't anyone we know.
Mr. Ambassador, it was a pleasure, and please give your wife my regards.
sir. - I look forward to seeing you...
sir. - Not now, Gibbs.
I'm going straight from here to a charity - Sir...
you're using one of my people. Call my office without my knowledge.
and schedule an appointment. - They're my people, too, Gibbs.
Yes, sir, but we function as a team.
if you remove one, everything changes.
director Vance told me to expect some push-back from you, but you're being borderline disrespectful.
that a compliment, sir?
you'll get DiNozzo back when I'm done with him.
what if he doesn't make it back?
sounds like you know more about this mission than you should, Gibbs. - No, sir,
I've just been there many times myself.
stop that car!
call an ambulance.
it's okay.
Oh, my God, Felix.
he's a friend.
well, your friend's dead, Mr. Secretary.
you think this has anything to do with it?
Mr. Palmer, what do you suppose the SECNAV is saying to them?
well, if I were him, I'd be asking how to get blood out of a $200 white dress shirt.
see, it's all about oxygenating the stain.
my mother used to use club soda, but my uncle preferred Perrier with a dash of...
um, the incision - they're probably talking about the incision.
well, it's in exactly the same location as Agent Levin's.
captain Wright was a highly decorated naval officer and a valued member of the DOD.
make this investigation a priority.
you could start with the incision in his arm.
NCIS Special Agent Levin had one, too.
there will be no discussion of Captain Wright's death with anybody outside this core group.
do I need to repeat myself?
no, sir.
your timing is impeccable.
I got the answer I was looking for.
on the DL, ask Agents McGee and David to find the thread that links Wright to Levin.
and the microchip?
I wish I knew.
did Gibbs notice you weren't at the hotel?
well, missing a crime scene never goes over well, but I was already on the mission.
what did you say to him?
I didn't.
he knew I wasn't there.
Gibbs sees everything, you know.
and where were you in your assignment at this point?
I don't know.
you know, when my mom died, we were in a room like this.
I remember 'cause there was a movie playing - Angels with Dirty Faces.
michael Curtiz.
these two kids growing up together.
bogie's priest.
Cagney...
the mobster searching for answers.
life's crossroads.
we all make decisions, some smarter than others.
pieces weren't fitting together.
I had to talk to Agent Barrett.
Why? She the one in the photograph?
the thing about chasing a federal agent - they know how to disappear.
she was careful about not leaving a paper trail.
not careful enough.
kiawah Island, huh?
nice. Beachy.
Hello, Tony, how are you?
working. Looks like you are, too.
there's someone I need to see - friend of a friend.
is it about the microchip you took out of Levin's arm?
we need to talk.
I can't, not till I get back.
I don't know what you're mixed up in, but people are looking for you, okay?
people who don't have the same personal investment as yours truly.
I made a promise to someone, Tony, and now I need to fulfill it.
I made a promise to someone, too - a promise I fully intend to keep.
you took something, EJ, something that's causing people a lot of concern.
is that why you're here? - And they want it back.
it's not mine to give.
you have an option here, but you have to trust me.
and what if I can't?
then I can't help you.
while I was getting deeper into my assignment, I knew Gibbs wouldn't be letting up, trying to figure out what Wright and Levin had in common.
anything, McGee?
uh, plenty.
after weeks of navigating red tape,
I think I finally got through the government firewall connecting Levin to Wright.
Yeah. And...?
both men used to be Office of Naval Intel.
oni isn't in Levin's file.
all the details were redacted.
both apparently worked for the Director of Special Operations, a civilian named Sean Latham.
Latham leads a secret armada of spy vessels called the Watcher Fleet.
watchers are loaded with billions in surveillance.
they constantly are monitoring terrorist and anti-military activity.
spying on the spies.
after their time at ONI, Agent Levin was transferred here, and Captain Wright went to the Pentagon.
gotta wonder what's on those microchips.
Yeah.
and who'd kill for 'em.
is this what Tony's wrapped up in?
special Agent Gibbs?
Yeah. What can I do for you?
agent Stratton, FBI.
busy night, huh?
burning the wick at both ends.
Yeah, that's what coffee's for.
can I help you with something, Stratton?
Yeah. Uh, Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
we got wind he may have been involved in an altercation with another federal agent.
can you verify that?
no.
well, is Agent DiNozzo a patient in this hospital or not?
well, being a patient doesn't mean he did anything wrong.
well... we'll be the judge of that.
no, you won't.
anything happened, this case would have been handed over to my IG for a 2B investigation.
I want to talk to him.
there was an accident.
he had a head injury.
I heard he was shot.
man, I tell you, you're just chock full of all kinds of bad information, Stratton.
go home.
sorry you got out of bed.
so, what happened after she decided to leave with you?
she was being evasive, and I needed answers.
people know you took the microchip. Why?
because Levin told me to.
because if anything happened to him, I swore I'd get it to the right person before it fell into the wrong hands.
what's on it?
I honestly have no idea.
you're lying. - All I did was make a promise.
to who? The highest bidder? Is that what this is about? You're selling information?
who were you going to see?
no one.
I need to know the truth, EJ.
navy Captain Felix Wright.
he's been out of the country.
no. He's dead.
go! Get in the car, EJ! Go!
stay down!
did you see 'em?
how many?
hold on.
so Barrett was the one in the photo.
the traitor.
I didn't say that.
they wanted their chip back.
Barrett took it.
they tried to kill her.
they were shooting at both of us.
you're defending her.
EJ...needed my help.
why do you think you keep getting involved with dysfunctional women?
What?!
well, the women you date are, well...
messed up.
I date all kinds of women.
you know, I think you're drawn to them because you want to help them.
I am drawn to them because, usually, they're pretty hot.
Tony, admit it.
you like hot girls who carry guns.
who doesn't like hot girls who carry guns?
which brings us back to Agent Barrett.
of course it does.
Oh, I see what you did there.
that was tricky.
you really like these head games, don't you?
you did that on purpose.
anger releases endorphins, and endorphins can jog all sorts of memories.
in the case file, Jarvis gave me some information about...
...microchips.
now that we know about Wright and Levin's Naval Intel connection, I did a little digging of my own.
when implanted under the flesh, microchips can leave behind metal hydride corrosion.
high-tech rust.
look what I figured out.
that it hurt.
well, yeah, but based on the level of metallic decomp Ducky found,
I was able to determine that the chips were implanted at approximately the same time.
both in the left arm, both in the same position, and both functioning as low-emitting radiofrequency I. D. tags.
they were access chips.
electronic door-openers.
Gibbs, this is Sean Latham, ONI's Director of the Watcher Fleet.
I didn't know if you guys really existed.
flesh and blood.
normally, we wouldn't be discussing an ONI program, but we have a situation.
and I just lost a dear friend. Sean?
Gayne Levin and Felix Wright worked for me as a part of a program called Phantom Eight
an eight-man squad that tried to preemptively influence international acts of terrorism.
stop 'em before they happen.
each operative was tagged with a microchip, a pass key, giving them access, worldwide, to the Watcher database.
wave your arm over a secure laptop, download classified information our enemies would pay top dollar for.
when Levin was killed, ONI's intention was to remove his chip immediately.
unfortunately, one of your agents got to him first.
and you think Agent Barrett is in it to make a profit?
we don't want to risk finding out.
why are you sharing this with me?
we now believe she's working internally...
with someone else.
you want to know who.
we're already looking, Gibbs.
find her, find the stolen microchips.
it's a matter of national security.
Hi, Gibbs.
boss, we need your help.
after you cook dinner.
so, I'm sitting there, and I'm...
you know, I'm on my third tequila.
I'm not in good shape, and Franks is, like, 12 sheets to the wind, when all of a sudden, the door swings open, and standing there are the three deadliest drug dealers in all of Mexico, and you know what Franks does? He turns to the bartender, and he says...
cervezas for my amigos.
if I'm dead, put it on my tab, probie.
his family's here now.
it's good to have 'em close.
you know what you got there, Barrett?
Nope.
I don't want to, either.
you were supposed to give it to Wright.
now what do we do?
figure out who it belongs to?
you think?
you don't trust anyone, do you, Gibbs?
Yeah, I do.
I just make 'em earn it.
the only people I trusted were the men on my team.
well...
I'm starting to worry about the big guy in all of this.
Cade? - Yeah.
Why?
Cade and Levin were tight.
maybe he knew too much.
get him back here.
you in contact?
not since we left.
try.
so that's when you realized you couldn't do this alone?
I trust these people with my life.
like family.
no. Not my family.
my family is...
way less dependable.
you should meet my father sometime. It would explain a lot.
I'd like that.
he'd like that, too, I think.
NCIS is...
part of who I am.
and yet you took an assignment that resulted in the death of another agent...
the very people you say you trust with your life?
you're contradicting yourself.
wouldn't be the first time.
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?
who are you?
didn't Gibbs tell you I was here?
I'm Agent Stratton, FBI.
I apologize.
I - I didn't realize Agent DiNozzo was with anyone.
and you are...?
his doctor.
look at me, interrupting with a doctor's work.
I'm just so glad to see you're alive, Agent DiNozzo.
Thanks.
it's a miracle, really, and thank heaven.
well, you and I can talk later, if that's all right with you, Doc.
I'm calling Agent Gibbs.
now is clearly the wrong time.
the doctor is in, so I'm out.
take care of yourself, pal.
okay?
so, Tony...
what happened next?
well, I knew it was time to resurface, time to come in and see what surfaced with me.
here you go.
Tony, you've been off the grid for weeks.
you miss me, McWorry-wart?
I was busy doing my job.
well, we were concerned.
we?
I see.
Yes, Tony, I expressed curiosity.
even though you're more than capable of taking care of yourself.
you and Ray are cut from the same quilt.
cloth.
of course.
makes total sense...
since EJ's the one you are after.
she's the one in the photograph, is she not?
you know I can't answer that.
McGee. Somebody help.
route my cell phone to the plasma.
tapping into the WiFi now.
it's Cade. He just sent me this message.
something's happened. He is in trouble.
you gotta help me, Abb.
I don't know what to do here.
someone's after me.
I just spoke to Fornell about Agent Stratton.
know him?
doc, can you give us a minute?
all right.
I'll go get my sixth cup of coffee for the evening.
lightweight.
ruin all my hard work and I'll kill you.
copy that.
brass from your weapon. We found it in the alley.
I told you, boss, I...
just shut up and listen, DiNozzo.
Abby's running DNA from spatter found at the scene.
in addition to your blood, there were two other types found.
two?
three people altogether, DiNozzo.
I know this is hard, but I need to know who you were handling.
great playing with you, Brian.
all right. I'll see you again.
been waiting long, DiNozzo?
permission to speak candidly, Mr. Secretary?
go for it.
this mission blows.
Oh, I'm sorry you're disappointed.
rule number one in Washington politics - don't take work personally.
I know a few rules, too, sir.
such as?
rule number three: Never believe what you're told.
what are you insinuating?
rule number five: Don't waste good.
in other words, I'm wasting your precious time?
and then, of course, there's my favorite - rule number 36:
if you feel like you're being played, you probably are.
what do you want?
I want you to take me off this assignment.
I can't do that.
I feel like I'm too close.
that's the sacrifice.
nature of the beast.
people are getting hurt- people I care about- and I'm not asking you, sir, I'm telling you.
you take me off this assignment or I resign from NCIS.
that felt like a threat.
you want to hear my second rule?
sure.
don't screw with me.
I own you.
know it, accept it.
it comes with the detail.
you gonna give me another speech about patience, maybe throw in a golf metaphor?
sure.
you're OB, Agent DiNozzo.
now, get lost before you say something you can't back out of.
I hope you play better than you negotiate.
spare me the criticism.
he seems to be handling things worse than you predicted.
he'll come around.
maybe.
maybe not.
they never saw it coming.
she was blindsided.
she?
Hey, Eej.
Oh, God, I thought for sure you were dead.
Oh, your hands are freezing.
let's go. There's a diner down the street. We can...
wait.
are you all right?
since I got shot, life has been different.
I can't work, and now I'm being chased and I have no idea why.
you sold out, Cade.
step away from him, EJ.
watch the hands.
well, tell her, big guy, go ahead.
tell her.
you know all about the microchip.
you already killed Captain Wright.
so, what, now you want to get your hands on Levin's, too?
what are you saying, DiNozzo?
Hey!
I got a message from EJ to come to DC.
next thing I know, I'm being hunted, and then she sends me a text to, to meet her here.
I never texted you.
EJ, who told you to come here tonight?
I thought you did.
the text said we should all meet here.
I got the same message.
you said I fired my gun.
what about the badge in my pocket?
metro found Cade's body along the Potomac.
the badge was his.
what about the gunshot wounds?
duck said the fatal shot was from another weapon.
shots from your gun were all postmortem.
so, what, they...
they planted the badge...
to make it look like I killed him?
EJ.
still looking.
Tony, you never fired.
you didn't kill them.
DiNozzo, the photo was always Cade.
you saw the photo.
you know who the problem is.
make it happen.
Yeah, I knew EJ didn't do it, but I needed her help to bring Cade in.
SECNAV was positive it was him.
I had to convince her to reach out and draw him back to DC.
well, it worked.
when EJ took the microchip...
the doors opened.
we were all used.
someone wanted those chips.
you saw the shooter, Tony, in that alley.
who was it?
he killed them.
lot of blood was shed.
gentlemen, I intend to find out who Casey Stratton really is.
bureau doesn't know him.
they tried to kill DiNozzo once.
they went to the hospital to finish the job.
we got stills from hospital security, but he hasn't turned up on any database.
I want to know how this son of a bitch knew about the microchips.
the mission was always Cade.
this was not supposed to happen.
agent DiNozzo is alive, Mr. Secretary.
guess you got lucky.
I guess we did.
Congratulations.
you, too, sir.
things turned out for the best.
Jarvis is none the wiser.
happy to oblige.
the girl still missing?
unfortunately.
find her.
I will.
now, then, shall we get down to business?
gentlemen.
who would like to start the bidding?
welcome to Beltway Burgers can i help you?
I'll call you back.
Victor, don't you dare!
don't worry, you'll get the hang of it soon.
way to kick a man when he's down, probie.
I cannot wait to hear this. What's going on?
found 15 hairs in my shower drain this morning.
I tell you this because you're my friends, and I need you.
for the past 12 years, every morning I have counted the hairs in my drain, and there have never been more than five.
never more than five. Never.
every day? - For the last 12 years?
you say that like it's not normal. - Well, that is not normal.
what is not normal is a man of my vim and vigor going bald.
well, bald can be very sexy.
sure, I mean, if you're Connery or Nicholson.
would you ever date a bald man?
I have dated men with thinning hair, yes.
thinning hair, but not Baldy McBald.
Hi, Special Agent Baldy McBald here.
want to go to Mount Baldy this weekend and do bald things?
bald. - Tony, you're not going bald.
says the man with emerging androgenetic alopecia. - With what?
you have a little thin patch on your vertex. - On my what?
you got a little bit of the skin yarmulke happening, Tim.
I thought I noticed I was getting thin up there.
Yeah, everyone's noticed.
you two are being ridiculous.
everyone's hair thins. It's barely noticeable.
and it's not like you guys are going gray.
I'm so glad that wasn't me.
gray can be really sexy.
Yeah, Gibbs.
lucky.
dead body? - No, worse.
where we going?
nowhere.
here you are.
what are you doing here?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
she called both of us.
that can't be good.
you have any idea what it's about?
no.
I can't drink that.
pass.
Yeah, I'll probably need something stronger.
I heard that.
since when have you needed an excuse to drink more than you should, Agent Fornell?
nice to see you, too, Mrs. Sterling.
agent Gibbs, thank you for coming.
both of you.
I didn't know who else to call.
figured that... - When you called us.
I need your help.
Victor didn't come home last night.
that's a record, even for you.
only married six months?
okay, Tobias, please, not now. - You guys have a fight?
no. - Did you call the police?
you know as well as I do it's too soon for them to do anything.
what do you want us to do? - I want you to look into it.
okay, I know what you guys are thinking, but Victor is not the kind of man to just disappear.
I'm not sure how to say this...
I do.
look, we're not your personal buddy-cop investigative service.
no. You're just my ex-husbands.
and I need your help.
the last time I spoke with Victor was 10: 00 p. m.last night. He was working late.
homeland Security, right? Paper pusher? - Data Storage Coordinator.
sounds important.
it's not. And he likes it that way.
he's not married to his work. He's married to his wife.
it's a novel concept for the two of you, I'm sure.
was he at the office when you spoke?
no, he had stopped at some fast-food joint.
he thinks I don't know, but I can smell it on him.
I'll bet.
what is that supposed to mean?
it means I wouldn't go home either if I was covered in bacon grease and there was a bloodhound waiting.
look, Diane, we're trying to help. - We have no evidence of a crime.
you haven't even looked yet.
my team is checking hospitals; they're running Victor's credit card.
you have to accept the chance that Victor might be taking a little break.
the three of us know it wouldn't be the first time.
no, it's not like this was.
Victor and I have a good relationship.
he knows how to treat a woman.
he's not afraid to show his emotions like some people.
she talking about us?
he's not some immature child that relates better to guns than to people.
okay, okay, we get it.
look, I know there's no love lost between us.
well, that's not... - Zip it, you.
but I know you both, and if your guts weren't telling you there was something to this,
I wouldn't be sitting here right now.
Hey, boss.
agent Fornell.
ma'am.
what? - Red hair.
we got a hit on Victor's credit card.
beltway Burgers in DC. 10: 00 p. m. last night.
that's federal jurisdiction.
anything else? - Yeah.
there was a 911 call made from the same place about a half hour ago.
morning crew found a bloodbath.
two males. Gunshots to the head.
both local DC residents, That guy's got good hair.
nothing's missing from the register.
security footage?
car in the drive-thru is registered to Victor Sterling.
I don't suppose he was hiding in the trunk?
no, but I did find his wallet and a gun near the car.
I hate telling Diane she's right.
sorry I'm late, Jethro.
would you mind pointing that somewhere else?
late night, Duck?
I haven't been sleeping well this past week.
enough said.
my bodies are on ice.
how considerate.
Gibbs, security footage was erased.
violent take-over, two dead guys, missing Homeland Security official.
you know what I'm thinking?
Victor was so desperate to get away from Diane, he had himself kidnapped?
that would make more sense than the alternative.
thomas Pearce, Homeland Security.
I came as soon as I got your call.
however, I only budgeted 20 minutes for the meeting, so who's this clown?
what's the alternative?
that someone actually wanted to kidnap Victor.
he works for Homeland Security,Someone might find that interesting.
you know, like terrorists?
homeland Security?
Yep, Homeland Security.
nice hair.
the only thing he ever had access to at Homeland were pencil inventories and mileage logs.
what I find interesting is how the same woman landed both Gibbs and Fornell.
Why? They're very much alike.
I don't think so.
Gibbs is wild savannah. Untamed.
this Diane lady must have serious game to have landed a wild beast like that.
wonder what her game is.
we still need to see whatever he was working on. - Of course.
one of your employees has gone missing.
you don't seem too concerned.
Oh, I am.
at least I will be after this conference call.
I have to inform our entire data services department we're officially switching over to a dual-layer DVD backup medium.
we got our own problems.
we still need to tell Diane about her husband.
not much to tell yet. - Yeah, that's the problem.
Yeah.
well, good luck with that.
I'm going to go over to the Bureau, run background on our two victims.
I'm a bald version of you.
took you long enough. - What do you got?
questions, and lots of them.
shoot.
okay, first up: How quickly after you and Diane got a divorce did she start dating Fornell?
because that must have been, you know, awkward.
um, okay, so we'll just, we'll just circle back to that one.
question number two: Were you jealous?
okay, so I see you're not ready to talk about this yet.
um, can I get a do-over?
what do you got, Abbs? - Security footage.
which was erased.
it was, but not securely.
so I'm working on reformatting the data.
I had more success with the gun that you found.
it is registered to Victor Sterling, and it has been fired maybe for the first time.
which reminds me-- did it bother you when Diane chose a husband so opposite to you?
Abbs! - Sorry.
Victor's prints were on the gun, so it looks like he did put up some sort of fight.
the most interesting thing that I found is what I didn't find.
Victor's wallet was obsessively organized.
but one card was missing.
now, leather deforms when it's compressed, and it takes hours for it to return to its prior shape.
based on the amount of residual deformation, that card was removed almost the same time as the murders.
any idea why?
no. Like I said, I have more questions than answers.
Where's Gibbs?
down in Abby's lab.
Where's her?
Diane? Getting something to eat.
hope she kills it first.
Yeah, she's pretty fiery. Can't be all bad.
you married her.
don't remind him.
got background on our two dead burger employees.
one's a Navy reservist.
guess that makes it official now.
NCIS-FBI joint case.
a marriage of sorts, if you will.
sorry.
the other's an aspiring model, recently divorced.
you check the ex-wife?
it was an amicable split. Imagine that. 50-50 down the line.
whereas you and I had our bank accounts cleaned out.
she even took your grandfather's watch.
let it out. Just let it all out.
I'd rather you didn't.
we finished the background search on Victor Sterling.
pretty much what Diane said.
he grew up in Chicago, went to college at UW-Madison.
joined Homeland Security five years ago.
lives a simple, modest life. - Except?
nothing modest about his bank accounts.
at least the ones he has taken great pains to hide.
Oh, Victor.
he has dozens of offshore bank accounts. The guy is loaded.
Where'd it all come from?
not what I'm wondering.
why is he hiding it?
two dead bodies, a missing Homeland Security agent and a lot of cash.
maybe that's what made him a target.
did you ask his wife about the money? - Not yet.
are you going to?
he can. - He can.
I don't think she knows about it.
well, have fun finding out, Agent Fornell.
I spoke to your boss.
we have a dead Naval Reservist, but kidnapping is your territory.
fine with me. - Agent Fornell will take the lead...
excuse me? - Works for me.
well, it doesn't for me.
any chance we can flip for it?
no. National security trumps your ex-wife issues.
she can't be all bad. You married her.
stop! Ma'am, you can't go in there!
when the hell were you going to tell me?
speak of the Devil. - You must be Mrs...
$2 million? Victor has $2 million?
boss, she made me tell her.
who needs enhanced interrogation?
what else haven't you told me? - We can talk about this downstairs.
what, do you have a basement here, too, Mr. Woodchuck?
Mrs. Sterling, I'm Director Vance.
rest assured my agents are doing everything possible to find your husband.
thank you. Just make sure they keep me informed, too.
wasn't any fun trying to pry information out of Macaulay Culkin here.
that's Victor's wallet.
Oh, my God, there's blood. - It's not his.
if it had just been a robbery, they would have taken his wallet, right?
they did take one of his cards.
we don't know which, though.
which slot was it in? - Excuse me?
driver's license, ATM card, Visa, photo of Shannon, cash, in that order.
Tri-fold wallet.
starting from the left side, condom beneath the fold...
okay, we got it.
excuse me.
do you know what Victor keeps here?
didn't have a name on it, but I remember the logo.
man's wallet is his kingdom.
the snooping says a lot about Gibbs' ex.
well, maybe Victor did something to deserve her lack of trust.
after all, he is hiding something.
agent DiNozzo, I presume?
Curtis Hubley, day manager.
agent David.
you're really hot.
thank you.
you don't get out much, do you, bud?
not really.
this is Victor Sterling, Homeland Security. Have you seen him?
Yeah. He's here once every few months for his routine inspection.
what does he inspect?
our systems. We're an off-site data storage facility for the local Homeland Security office.
we back up their, uh, accounting data, personnel records, noncritical stuff.
Victor in some kind of trouble?
well, we believe that he has been kidnapped, yes.
that's terrible.
so you want to get a drink, talk about it?
no. - I figured that.
any idea why Victor was kidnapped?
not yet.
but the access card that he used for this place is missing.
we would like you to check to see if anyone has used it.
sure. Yeah. That's easy enough.
you have the softest-looking skin.
now you're getting creepy.
I know. I'm sorry. I'm working on it.
okay. Victor. Access card.
here you go.
good job.
got me a little excited.
card was used just last night around 12: 00.
that was after he was taken.
we have security footage.
it's normally offline for maintenance at midnight, but we switched the schedule.
pull it up. - Yeah.
it's on a different system.
be back in a flash.
I think he likes you.
got it.
here you go.
that's the entrance to the server room.
is there another angle?
you got it.
blow that up.
can you freeze that? - Yup.
that's Victor.
anything else I can do for you, baby?
got to tell you, I never saw this coming.
but it is somewhat satisfying.
sterling entered the facility at 12: 14 a. m. this morning.
two hours after he disappeared from the fast food restaurant.
once inside, downloaded a single file.
What'd he take?
we're not sure yet because he erased the file header when he logged out.
McGee said it was just a bunch of numbers.
Numbers?- He thinks it's accounting-related.
maybe a budget. He and Abby are working on it now.
well, he is a glorified accountant.
Yeah, with two million bucks in the bank.
what are you thinking? Embezzlement?
you guys would know better than anyone what he's up to.
yeah?
why is that, DiNozzo?
you were both married to his wife.
I'm not following you.
well, she must have a type, right?
so, you must have a lot in common with Victor.
nothing. Couldn't be more opposite. In fact...
if I may interject, someone should talk to Diane to make sure that Victor has not tried to contact her.
she has a point. - Yeah, she does.
and you got lead.
where are you going? Isn't the conference room the other way?
that's why I'm headed to autopsy.
DiNozzo, determine whether Victor had any contact with Diane.
divorce is as old as Hammurabi, whose code allowed it almost 4, 000 years ago.
other countries took a little longer to catch up.
for instance, in Ireland, divorce wasn't legalized until 1997.
thank God I'm not Irish.
can you imagine being stuck with her?
don't have to imagine. We are.
unless you can pull a rabbit out of that body, Duck.
sorry. This man's last meal consisted solely of fried cheese.
but there are some things to note.
the first is an oddity concerning rope burns where the victims' hands were bound.
I don't see any rope burns.
well, that's the oddity.
both victims' wrists were tied, yet neither apparently struggled.
sedated? - Negative.
it's highly unusual not to see some signs of a struggle
unless, of course, they were feigning captivity.
they weren't feigning being shot in the head.
perhaps they just outlived their usefulness.
are you suggesting the crime scene was faked, Ducky?
to just make it look like Victor was abducted?
Yeah, well, the theory casts a new light on this.
Abby ran ballistic tests on the bullets that killed these two.
they were fired from Victor's gun.
Oh, well, that's just peachy.
unless, of course, the killer used Victor's gun for the murders.
or he is the murderer.
and you've had absolutely no contact with your husband since the last phone call?
I have already told you no.
this is such a waste of time. Where are Leroy and Tobias?
Leroy? - Yes, Leroy.
you do know your boss's name.
of course I do. Just never heard it pronounced that way.
how do you pronounce it?
Gibbs. And he's busy.
I just have a few more questions.
true or false.
you're an exceptionally good cook.
excuse me?
cook. Food. You like to cook?
Oh, my God.
you're trying to figure out why Leroy married me.
no.
wow, you're a terrible liar. - I'm a fantastic liar.
just not very good at it right now.
I could tell you why Leroy married me，but you have a job to do .
you wouldn't be able to concentrate the rest of the day if I do.
I think that ship's already sailed.
Leroy, what's with the 20 questions from your agent?
Victor is now a suspect in our investigation.
is that a joke?
Uh,this was taken at a data storage facility after Victor disappeared.
and his gun was used in the murders at the drive-through.
I-I don't understand.- Neither do we.
I do. And I wish I didn't. Bad news, Gibbs.
we were able to identify the data that Victor downloaded.
for what? - For a virus.
one that could kill a lot of people.
this is the data Victor downloaded.
so what we thought were budget numbers is actually a numerical representation of a virus genome.
that make sense to you? - No.
it's simple. DNA is just a code.
when we sequence it, we figure out what the code is, and then we store it as a series of numbers.
Gibbs, you remember Carol?
uh, she's a lab tech at the V. A. - Infectious Disease Program Office.
what's your name, cutie?
Tobias. I'm old enough to be your father.
I asked Carol to try to help me ID which virus this genome belongs to.
Ebola variant RUV-76.
the usual stuff-- you bleed from every orifice.
it disintegrates your organs, and then you die. - From numbers?
well, that's all these were ten years ago when they were sequenced - and stored and forgotten in some warehouse. - But times have changed.
it's now possible to build a synthetic virus from scratch using a numerical recipe just like this and gene sequences you can get online.
I keep saying it-- things were better before the Internet.
how bad?
it's bad, but the good news is, this variant is only spread by touch and it's too virulent to cause a pandemic.
which is a nice way of saying people die too quickly to spread the disease too far.
doesn't make sense, Gibbs. Victor strike you as a terrorist?
no. I mean, he's a paper pusher, not a mass murderer.
embezzlement I'll buy.
maybe this is his big score.
I mean, if terrorism was his goal, there were way deadlier viruses to steal in this database.
this virus is tactical. It would make the perfect weapon.
it'd be worth millions if he found the right buyer.
he doesn't want to use it. - He wants to sell it.
but first he has to build it.
and there's only one place in the area that has the ability to create man-made viruses.
right.
lot of pricey equipment here to just leave the front door open.
noticed.
man down!
smells like a morgue.
where is everybody?
found them.
they tried to shoot their way out.
didn't get very far.
looks like they built the virus.
and took it with them.
Ziva says the HazMat teams are clearing the lab now.
Ducky will be able to autopsy the bodies soon.
I think we know what killed them.
ids? - Well, the lab ID'd the two techs. We ID'd the other two.
got Dwight Kilborn and Jeremiah Ness.
both ex-Special Forces.
both have been freelancing for mercenary groups for the last ten months.
been doing more than that.
Abby was able to reconstruct part of the erased security tapes from the burger place.
gunmen look familiar?
that's what I was talking about.
see? That's the thinning part on the vertex.
those are our stiffs from the lab.
they hit a fast food joint one night, then they end up dead in a lab the next? What gives?
Victor doesn't look in charge to me.
looks like a victim.
could be what we're supposed to think. - What do you mean?
well, these guys are pros.
they had to know we'd be able to reconstruct the videotapes.
which means we'd see Victor getting grabbed. AKA victim.
Seriously? Victor fakes his own kidnapping, then he steals a deadly virus, and then uses that to kill his own crew? How devious is this guy?
wouldn't be the first time she married the wrong guy.
of course, he's not the only one keeping secrets.
you didn't tell them? - What?
well, you had told us to back-check Victor and Diane, and we came up with some discrepancies.
what discrepancies?
Diane had mentioned in passing she never left the country.
Yeah, and? - Well, being extremely diligent, I checked her PNR, and it places her in the Cayman Islands in '04, then again in '06.
are you sure?
well, the only reason I mention it is because the Caymans are the money-laundering capital of the world.
wait, wait, wait.
she may be the spawn of Satan, but she's also the mother of my child.
no way Diane is involved.
rule 69: Never trust a woman who doesn't trust her man.
keep digging. - How deep?
till you get to the bottom.
you son of a bitch! How dare you!
what the hell are you doing poking into my private life?!
doing my job.
I'm not the one who's missing, Victor is!
you knew I was coming.
no.
tell me about the Caymans.
ancient history.
have you been just waiting for this all these years?
an opportunity to twist the knife in?
no. No, that's your specialty .
your way of getting even with me for leaving you?
should give you a medal.
Yeah, well, if there is a medal, I do deserve it for staying so long.
it wasn't easy being a human anti-depressant.
what, you didn't think I knew?
you just married me to get over Shannon?
sorry.
that, that was...
I'm scared, Leroy.
then tell me about the Caymans.
I met someone in '04.
he had a place in the Caymans.
I had a husband who, uh, was never around.
this guy paid attention to me.
that's all I ever wanted, you know? From you or Tobias.
just somebody to be there, you know?
so you married him?
Yep, six months ago.
by the way, thanks for the waffle iron. Victor loves it.
Leroy, whatever you think Victor's involved in, you're wrong.
just find him and you'll see.
just find him.
please?
why didn't you tell her I was here?
why didn't you?
Diane and I were still married in '04. - I know.
she cheated on me with Victor.
now we really gotta find the son of a bitch.
Yeah, it's Gibbs. - Boss.
Yeah, McGee? - I got a break off a cell from one of the dead gunmen.
got a location on the last call it made. - Where?
it's an abandoned warehouse in Anacostia. Tony's on his way.
no, no, no!
you're driving. Come on. Let's go.
DSC? - Data Storage Coordinator, Department of Homeland Security!
thank God.
it's a hell of a rat trap, Jethro. - Yeah.
they got me chained.
not too bad for two guys who missed the wedding.
work.
you're forgiven. Thank you.
get over here, Leroy.
why exactly am I being debriefed in an interrogation room?
okay, I can, I can explain that.
Oh, you got a lot of explaining to do, Lucy.
they told me if I didn't get their virus, they would kill Diane.
who? - I don't know. I was blindfolded.
they tell you to commit murder, too?
come on, guys, I'm being set up!
they made it look like I staged my own kidnapping.
kept me alive so I could be the fall guy. You can't see that?
what I see is a career bureaucrat who's got way too much money in the bank.
most of it hidden offshore.
in the Caymans, where you like to take a lot of vacations with other people's wives!
Oh, is that what this is about?
Hey, sit down. - No, I won't sit down!
you guys had your chance with Diane and you blew it!
this has nothing to do with me or her.
and I had nothing to do with that! - Mrs. Sterling!
sit down or I'll make you sit down!
ma'am... - Back off, Macaulay!
get the hell away from him! - Boss, I'm sorry. I tried to stop her.
Diane, I am so glad to see you.
you get the hell away from me!$2 million dollars?
and I've been worried about how we're gonna pay the mortgage?
you're on your own.
well?
it's family money.
I inherited it years ago, long before we met.
keep talking.
when you have a lot of money, it's hard to tell who your friends are.
and with women, it's even harder.
so I took the cash and I invested it and I forgot about it.
it's our nest egg, baby.
I was gonna surprise you when I retired.
so, basically, you couldn't believe that I would love you if you were rich?
you didn't trust me, but you married me anyway?!
I am gonna make your life a living hell!
Diane, I'm okay, baby.
I'm safe now. - I was so scared!
it's okay, okay. It's okay. It's okay.
Oh, Diane, I love you so much. Oh, I love you so much.
you all right?
I'm okay. I'm okay.
okay. Okay, Don Juan. - I'm going to be fine.
if you're not selling the virus, then who is?
selling it?
I thought you guys knew.
we knew what?
they're not planning on selling the virus. They're planning on using it.
thank God you're all right.
and I want to let you know that you're gonna be getting overtime for this entire ordeal.
sit. - I've alerted SecNav.
agent David said you think the attack's today.
are you sure?
go on, tell him.
there was the brains of an old LX 57433-X in the storage room where they were keeping me.
a what?
it's an old office voicemail system from the '90s.
I was in charge of requisitions for the CBO in '97, so was familiar...
cut to the chase.
I was able to use the 433-X to patch into an old intercom panel.
I could just make out one of my captors talking to someone.
warning them to stay indoors today.
with a deadly virus, that can only mean one thing.
any idea what the target is? - No.
Yeah, Abbs, go ahead.
I might have a lead on their target. - I'll be right down.
Abby thinks she has a lead.
go. I'll call SecNav back.
Mr. Pearce, you hit Homeland.
Fornell, FBI. - Got it.
I got a lead on the conversation that Victor overheard.
this is the old phone that he used to MacGyver into the intercom system.
it converts analog signals into digital ones, and then it stores it briefly in RAM.
Abbs, I don't care. What do you got?
I was able to pull the last few seconds of the conversation.
stay indoors tomorrow and as far away from...
so, whatever it is, tomorrow is today.
Yeah, we know.
there's more.
and as far away from the game as you can.
the game." I searched the Google, and there's only one in town today.
armed Forces Football Game.
Yeah, biggest one of the year. There'll be, like, 60, 000 people there.
virus is spread by touch; they can't hit them all.
Oh, I'm not so sure, Gibbs.
this was found in the warehouse where Victor was held.
it's used to... - Powderize milk.
my uncle had one of these on his farm.
of course he did.
anyways, it's clean now, but I found traces of the virus in it, so we have to assume that it's also been powderized.
which means?
which means that it's transmissible by air now.
every single person at that stadium is at risk, Gibbs.
got it, Abbs. Thanks.
welcome to the 2011 Armed Forces Football Game, the annual charity event which brings together all five branches of the military.
this year the Armed Forces also has to take on Monroe University.
three minutes to kickoff.
it's not too late to evacuate.
we evacuate, they release the virus.
come on through. Right through here. Yes, sir. Come on through.
Abby says we're looking for a pressurized container, should be in a public place.
sweeping the tunnel. On it, boss.
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
Gibbs, we have a problem. - Figured.
I finished processing the virus on the powderizing machine.
there's not enough for a large-scale attack, only, like, a few dozen people.
maybe we were wrong about the location.
we're not.
nothing here, either, McGee.
give me that.
Hey, McGee.
VIP list-- who's at the game today?
hang on, boss. Checking.
a lot of bigwigs.
luxury box is filled with top brass from all five military services.
boxes. Got it.
got to be our target.
check him.
Hey, what do you see?
two of them-- 30 yards.
working the vents.
ready?
condom underneath the fold?
really, Tobias?
same one I had in college.
I never used it.
just like what it represents.
hope?
now!
homeland Security.
son of a bitch.
Congratulations.
but you haven't done anything here today.
you don't even know what you're fighting for.
suddenly I'm not feeling very homelandy or secure.
I want answers.
a Homeland Security employee just tried to commit an act of terrorism.
not a terrorist attack, Leon, just supposed to look like one.
it was a targeted assassination.
who? - Our top military policy makers.
all in town to preside over a massive drawdown of our military forces.
got a hit list off Pearce's computer.
who was he working for?
good question.
with billions at stake, a lot of guys don't want to see that drawdown happen.
guys like these.
McGee found contacts with all of them on Pearce's computer.
doesn't mean they're involved.
but it's a good bet our bad guy is on this list.
someone must have promised Pearce quite a cozy position when he moved to the private sector.
beware the military-industrial complex.
next part of this investigation is gonna step on a lot of toes.
you left me a bone sandwich, Gibbs.
I cut the crust off for you.
FBI does have the lead.
good luck, Agent Fornell.
Thanks.
Ah, cheer up, Tobias.
at least you'll never have to talk to Diane again.
I have a child with her.
Oh, that's right. Guess I won't have to.
I'm out of bourbon.
I didn't come for a nightcap.
I know you used to come down here to avoid me, Leroy.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I know.
I wasn't the easiest person to live with.
I'll agree with that.
thank you for finding Victor.
he saved a lot of people.
good man.
would you tell Tobias that I never meant to hurt him?
Oh, yeah, he knows.
I think.
I really liked him.
but I never should have married him.
I didn't love him.
just like you never loved me.
I liked you.
I still do.
but the only woman you'll ever love is Shannon.
you were my Shannon, Leroy.
you know what you got there, Barrett? - Nope.
each phantom operative was tagged with a microchip, giving them access worldwide to the Watcher database.
EJ, who told you to come here tonight?
I thought you did.
so, who'd you shoot, Agent DiNozzo?
I need your help.
I don't know. Can't remember any of it.
special Agent Gibbs? Agent Stratton, FBI.
gentlemen, I intend to find out who Casey Stratton really is.
bureau doesn't know.
we got stills from hospital security, but he hasn't turned up on any database.
your girl's still missing?
unfortunately.
find Agent Barrett.
child abuse is what it is.
no more junk food at my house.
no more video games at mine.
stupid New Year's resolutions.
they make them, and we suffer.
I swear, I can't wait to grow up and move out of this puny old town.
nothing ever happens here anyway.
what?
come on.
you okay, mister?
no.
morning!
I never thought I'd end up being known as the cheerful one at the office.
wait, what?
are you saying we're not cheerful?
last couple weeks, I'd say more-- I don't know- surly.
Surly?
surly you're Mc-staken.
didn't seem that way at the Navy District New Year's party.
gotcha!
cause I didn't even go to the Naval District New Year's Eve party.
neither did I. - Then I rest my case.
since when do either of you ever miss a party?
also known as the holiday blues.
pre and post. Not at all uncommon.
that'll do, Dr. Phil.
I don't suppose you heard anything from C. I.Ray over the holidays, did you?
what about you?
weren't you supposed to visit your old flame in Baltimore?
Wendy. Yes.
something came up.
told you to stifle, Edith.
I don't have the blues, I just have the blahs, you know?
every time New Year's comes around, just kind of,whack.
I don't know.
well, only you can do something about that, Tony.
change, my dear, requires some action.
this coming from a woman who's been waiting eight weeks for a single, solitary phone call from one lousy dude.
seven.
and maybe I'm done waiting.
maybe it's finally time we both took some action.
maybe... - No time for maybes.
got a dead Naval officer.
there's nothing maybe about that. Let's go.
to be continued? - Maybe.
one gunshot wound to the neck, one to the chest that I can see.
given the angle of entry, both were fired from the commander's immediate right.
Ergo,"riding shotgun.
too easy?
too surly.
navy Commander James Barnsway, 35.
those kids were first on the scene.
said they heard a loud screech of tires and then the crash.
passenger door's open.
well, they didn't see any passenger.
there are no bullet casings in the truck.
lack of stippling on this wound would indicate a distance greater than the passenger seat.
passenger window's open.
what are you thinking, DiNozzo?
it's more like what I'm not seeing, boss.
there's no skid marks here for the pickup, which means he ran full steam into that car.
kids said they heard a tire screech; probably came from those skid marks right there. Hmm?
alongside.
making it possible the shots were fired from a second vehicle.
Yeah, that was kind of my point.
more than possible.
had to be riding high to get that angle.
hell of a shot.
the boys didn't hear any shots fired. Just the crash.
well, then a hell of a shot with a silencer.
on it, boss.
I'm the one who called the police.
but you have to understand, I'm not one for getting involved.
but you did see the crash?
no, heard it.
what exactly did you see?
well ,Yes, yeah, go right there.
I got to the window just as that other car was speeding off.
what kind of car was that?
one of those SUVs.
blue.
Oh, no, wait.
uh, it was green.
or gold.
did you hear anything like gunshots?
Oh, Lord, no.
I can't imagine that girl would have got out of Jimmy's truck if there'd been gunshots.
there was a girl?
pretty blond.
ran off into the woods over there.
or maybe it was red.
Oh, the SUV, not her hair.
that was definitely blond.
Well,So, you know the commander?
Jimmy, yes.
man is a war hero.
he didn't look too good.
is he gonna be all right?
what about the girl? You know her, too?
no, but I will tell you, it wasn't Mrs. Jimmy.
not that I'm one for getting involved.
so, the commander has a wife?
Oh, Cara, yes.
sings in our church choir.
poor Cara.
it'll pain me so to have to tell her.
I'm really not one for... - Getting involved. Yes, we know, we know.
we'll save you the trouble.
it's no trouble.
I can give Cara a call right now. Really, I can.
we'd rather you didn't, ma'am.
not until we know what color SUV she drives.
or how good a shot she is.
Really?
Jimmy's been defending this country his whole life.
for this to happen now, at home, in our little town...
I'm sorry to have to ask, Mrs. Barnsway, but we're gonna need to confirm your whereabouts this morning.
me?
you think I'd kill my husband?
we have reports that an SUV was observed leaving the scene.
so just because I drive an SUV?
also, that the commander did not die alone.
there may have been a woman with him.
Oh, my God.
of course.
is that what this is?
is she dead, too?
you know about her?
she called before breakfast.
Oh, God, what was her name?
um, she was an old friend of Jimmy's.
some Navy connection overseas from years ago.
did he say where she was calling from?
I don't know.
not far. He was going to bring her home.
she needed his help.
help with what?
I doubt Jimmy even asked.
he just dropped everything and ran out.
one thing about my husband:
he would, he would do anything for a friend.
commander James Barnsway.
a 14-year veteran, recently assigned as a training officer at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station.
previous deployments are all over the globe:
iraq, Bahrain, Gitmo, Sao Paolo, Naples.
Naples?
Yeah. As in Italy, Tony, not Florida.
navy has a base there, DiNozzo.
of course.
Yeah, no, I just, I thought I... misheard.
uh, call to the commander's cell this morning came from a burn phone.
no way to trace it, but I'm looking for where it was purchased.
enemies?
none that we know of, but the commander did have a reputation for being a hard-nosed commanding officer.
any complaints filed against him?
I'll find out.
Abbs. Yeah, you were my next stop, honest.
so, Naples, huh?
what about it?
I hear the pizza's great.
Tony. - It was nothing, guys. Really.
nothing.
nothing.
no telling markers, no striations.
they're both nine-millimeter.
a Glock, a Beretta maybe.
silencer fits both.
which explains the lack of a bang.
did you get any prints off the brass?
Nope.
we're dealing with a really careful killer here, Gibbs.
there were no prints, no residue, no nothing.
can't use nothing, Abbs.
well, then let's get to the something.
the memory on the pickup's GPS was damaged during the collision, so it's displaying this crazy spaghetti pattern at the moment.
Mmm, spaghetti, meatballs.
garlic bread. Mmm, garlic bread.
Abby. - Sorry.
I have to stop working through my lunch.
anyways, I was able to work backwards from where the pickup crashed, try to retrace its steps or its spins, or whatever tires do, and we get this.
it's sort of like a reverse Pac-Man or like working a maze from the end.
go to where it starts.
486 Overpass Lane.
also known as the Highway 12 Motor Lodge.
it's just a few miles out of town.
that's not nothing.
no, that's something.
just like you, Abbs.
whoever was in that room got out of there in a hurry.
sorry I did not see her leave.
I assure you I had no idea the lady was in any kind of trouble.
you have her credit card on file?
no, sir, she paid cash.
still, she must have shown you some form of I. D.
I'm embarrassed to say no.
uh, she was so terribly pleasant.
like one of those Star Wars Jedi people.
Uh,you do not need to see my I. D.
um... it was late, I was tired.
you too tired to even get her name?
Oh, no, no, no, I made sure she signed in.
it's always good to know the name of whatever serial killer you might be harboring.
she's a serial killer?
she is Belva Lockwood.
and all she needed for a room was cash, a name and a smile?
to be honest, it was double cash, three nights in advance.
times are hard.
Belva Lockwood, the first female to run for president.
1884
in what movie did you learn that?
I read a book once.
that mean something to you?
well, it just sounds like an alias.
you have a security camera around here somewhere?
these are beyond blurry, Gibbs.
there's not much enhancing I can do here, boss.
can you try streaming them again?
we are lucky to have streamed them the first time, McGee.
equipment over here is not exactly state of the art.
but we do keep the sheets clean.
ABBY: I might have software in my lab that can help us with this.
whatever you can do, Abbs.
if we saw this woman leave with the commander.
we should be able to see when she came back to the hotel.
hold it.
time code-- only half an hour ago.
then she leaves again... five minutes later.
which way?
well, if I was looking to get out of Dodge in a hurry with no car I just might look to hitch the closest ride I could find.
not bad.
I know, right?
it's like a computer chemical peel.
let's buff out the blemishes and smooth out the skin.
it's like a regular digital face-lift.
how do I look?
uncomfortable.
got anything?
manager says a woman in a red jacket came in ten minutes ago looking for a ride.
and she just got one.
tanker truck.
there.
stop!
get out of the truck.
hands where we can see them!
don't shoot!
I just met the lady.
get out of the truck now!
Um,maybe you should give Gibbs a call?
tell him we've got an I. D.
Hi, guys.
you're alive.
hungry, Barrett?
not anymore. Thanks.
so this has been it for you?
on the lam, running town to town?
since they killed Cade, yeah.
you left me lying on the ground in an alleyway.
I thought you were dead, too, Tony. - You thought?
it was days before I found out you were okay.
much to my relief. - Didn't stop you from running, did it?
I wasn't running, Tony.
I was on the run.
Oh, there's a distinction."I wasn't running. I was on the run.
you were running.
enough.
you know that we were there for you, right?
I didn't know anything, Gibbs.
except that I needed answers and couldn't count on anyone else to give them to me.
not even us?
not without putting you in danger again.
so you were protecting us?!
and trying to find out who killed Cade before they killed me.
you were protecting yourself! - Yes!
Hey, will you stop it?!
you were wearing a vest that night, right?
same one I wore this morning.
and lucky I did, too.
not so lucky for Barnsway.
I never should have called him.
why did you?
I'd been up in Jersey a month or so before they got onto me.
I guess I'd been on my own so long... I don't know.
I needed a friend.
they? You keep saying "they," Barrett.
who's "they"?
who's this?
he's the guy who killed Cade.
posed as FBI. Name is Stratton.
this isn't who shot at me this morning.
this, This isn't who killed Jim. - You sure?
I saw the shooter up close, Tony.
I know his face, and that is not it.
take her down to Abby.
what for? - Go.
and there she goes.
we're running your shooter through every possible database we have access to.
not a bad rendering, Abby.
think we captured his essence?
we'll see if it captures him.
so, you're absolutely positive that's your shooter, huh?
if I imagine him pointing a gun in my face.
Yeah, Tony, close enough.
this might take a while.
nowhere else to be.
Okey,okey, then.
I'm just gonna, um... I'll be in there if you need me.
so?
so... I had the craziest feeling when I saw your buddy Barnsway had been stationed in Naples.
cause you always raved about Naples.
birthplace of the pizza.
wasn't until I saw that the first female presidential candidate- 1884
had been checked into a roadside motel, that I got a gut feeling.
you remembered Belva Lockwood?
how could I forget?
that was some night.
you going on and on about how cool you thought Belva was.
you know, I've noticed something about you, EJ.
you have a tendency to disappear.
consequently, I spent a lot of time looking for you.
a lot of time.
so you didn't think you could reach out?
I was scared, Tony.
hell, I don't even know why he's after me.
it's not like I could identify him.
looks like you just did.
with all due respect for what she has been through, Tony, how could EJ think that living off the griddle is a better option than having us protect her?
that's living off the grid, Ziva.
and, uh, Tony, you got to admit, the whole thing is a little bit fishy.
spare me your conspiracy theories, all right?
you're preaching to the choir.
we simply do not want to see you get hurt.
again.
I can handle myself.
I'll be the judge of that.
go.
former Captain Marcellus Dane, 41 years old, 23 missions with the SEALs in Iraq before being dishonorably discharged at General Court-Martial in '05.
our records indicate that it had something to do with accepting bribes from private contractors.
which is no surprise, since he was then hired by the same contractors to be a weapons specialist.
he's an expert in handguns.
known to carry a Beretta M9, both on and off the battlefield.
same type of weapon used on Barnsway.
it is possible, given the commander's travels, that he and Dane crossed paths in Iraq at some point.
and not in a very good way.
maybe Dane had his own reason for going after the commander.
no offense, Ziva.
that is a plausible theory, but that man was shooting at me.
you have to take my word for it. - Why?
Dane have an address?
Yeah. Last known is in Seattle, but he does have a cell phone that just rebooted in downtown DC.
just pinged a signal from an industrial apartment loft at Gentry and 7th.
so much for our careful killer.
does seem a bit careless for a seasoned paramilitary operative.
Yeah, a little too careless.
let's be ready for anything.
let's? Barrett, let's?
like you and us?
well, I can't stay here, Gibbs.
Oh, sure you can. Watch this.
keep her here.
me?
but I'm the one he's after.
all the more reason not to take a target along.
boss, there's no way. I cannot...
DiNozzo, make that two targets.
if Stratton's behind that guy, then both of you need to sit tight.
okay, okay, move it on back, folks.
there's nothing to see.
NCIS. - Go on through.
people seem to die wherever Marcellus Dane goes.
I'll check the building.
don't bother.
he's right here.
cops say this happened just a few minutes ago.
stabbed and then tossed.
the phone signal.
whoever did this wanted us to see it.
I got a pretty good idea who.
all right.
Mr. Secretary.
special Agent Gibbs.
sorry to interrupt, sir.
you got a minute?
we're just finishing up. Can it wait?
or would you care to join us? - Neither, sir. Nothing personal.
excuse me, gentlemen.
give us a minute?
need a favor, Mr. Secretary.
Oh, guess I better listen then.
I need you to talk to Sean Latham.
Why?
because we may have a bead on Casey Stratton.
Gibbs, the FBI takes imposters very seriously.
they have a task force solely focused on.- Not about the FBI, sir.
phantom Eight. Ring a bell?
Yeah.
it came up in discussions when Agent DiNozzo was injured.
clandestine unit associated with the Watcher Fleet. Classified.
does that mean that Stratton is classified, too?
you're saying this is him?
Stratton killed Cade, sir.
he tried to kill DiNozzo and Barrett.
agent Barrett is M. I.A. - Not any longer.
she's in a safe house with DiNozzo on Old Rag Mountain.
that's good news.
you're the one who brought Latham into this, sir.
he saw the hospital surveillance.
he should have recognized Stratton.
maybe. Perhaps.
but we don't even know if they're in contact anymore.
with all due respect, sir, this son of a bitch had a locator chip in his arm.
Latham knows how to find him.
Latham needs to bring him in.
the game was great, Boss.
Yeah.
we won, of course.
how'd yours go?
Oh, it's not until tomorrow, huh?
forgot about that.
okay, well, we'll let you know how that goes.
we're just gonna do a little bit of tailgating.
and maybe crack a cold one.
good luck tomorrow.
heard a lot of code in my day.
that, my friend, ranks among some of the lamest.
what's lame about a couple guys talking sports?
besides, we don't know if these phones have been compromised.
at least now we know that Jarvis is on board.
when's the last time anyone tidied up around here?
well, it's called a safe house, not a tidy house.
I know it's a far cry from the luxurious truck stop motor lodge you've been staying in.
at least I can't do any more damage here.
not really where I was going with it, but okay.
can you blame me for feeling responsible?
I mean, first Levin, then Cade, then... Jimmy Barnsway.
God, his poor wife must be heartbroken.
well, if it helps, she said her husband would do anything for a friend.
doesn't help, but thanks anyway.
you should cut yourself some slack, EJ.
what's the saying?
that which does not kill us makes us stronger.
I think Nietzsche said that.
important thing to remember about Friedrich Nietzsche, of course, is that he died in an insane asylum.
this is probably not the best way to start a pep talk, huh?
listen, we all have regrets.
I've made mistakes.
a couple of doozies.
as for your mistakes...
sleep tight, Agent Barrett.
Mr. Secretary.
Sean, thanks for coming on such short notice.
I assumed we'd be meeting in Director Vance's office.
Yeah, there's more than one SCIF, sir.
why don't you have a seat?
agent Gibbs.
guess that leaves you in charge.
me? No. SECNAV can hold his own.
I don't doubt that.
I know everything there is to know about my team, sir.
do you?
blast from the past.
where the hell'd you get it?
I found it in a box.
Mr. Secretary, this is classified material.
you know this guy?
pretty obvious I used to.
you never thought to mention knowing him a few months ago?
I'm sorry, Mr. Secretary, is there something I'm missing here?
you said nothing when Stratton came to the hospital looking to gun down my best agent.
hold on, you think this is him?
are you saying it's not?
gentlemen, this is Captain Jonathan Cole.
former Army Green Beret.
I recruited him into the Phantom program in '03.
afraid you've got the wrong man.
wrong name, maybe. Right man.
is it possible, Sean?
absolutely not.
Cole's a good man and a highly-trained operative.
trained to kill.
he gunned down an NCIS agent; now he's trying to get rid of everybody who saw him do it.
you know that for a fact?
agent DiNozzo made that ID under physical and mental duress.
you're not denying knowing him, right, Sean?
of course not. - Then let me talk to him.
contact Cole, tell him we'd like to arrange a meeting.
tell him the Secretary of the Navy would like a moment of his time.
look, if I could reach Cole, what's our timetable?
soon.
two of his targets are living in a safe house.
it's less safe the longer he's out there.
make it happen, Sean.
rise to the occasion.
I'll do what I can.
uh... Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch!
room service.
easy, Lion.
tiger. Easy, Tiger.
you could have called.
my cell phone does not like these mountains, apparently.
why are you drooling?
is that what I hope it is?
coffee.
and muffins with jam.
you know, Ziva, everything Tony told me about you when we first met
absolutely not true.
what?
I never said that she didn't like coffee.
how did everyone sleep last night?
I slept in the chair. She slept on the couch.
that's not what I was asking.
well, considering that I slept vertically,
I'm gonna see if a little hot water can loosen up my lower extremities.
excuse me, ladies.
if this goes on another night, I'll make sure he takes the couch.
Gibbs met with Latham, but don't plan on leaving here anytime soon.
I have something else for you.
after you went missing, Gibbs had me access your secure work e-mail for possible leaks.
should I prepare to be embarrassed?
not at all.
these are from your mother.
I was not sure if you. had reached out to her recently.
not in months.
I didn't want my parents to be in danger.
thank you for this.
nothing you would not do for me, I'm sure.
well, so much for my big plans, huh?
what about your plans, Ziva?
beyond NCIS?
a family?
maybe someday.
though that day seems increasingly distant at the moment.
to someday. - Hmm?
someday.
Hey, boy.
what's his name?
Mr. Christian.
not a very trustworthy name for man's best friend.
you realize the position you've put me in?
they've made the connection, Cole.
they want me to set you up.
so? - Do it.
it might actually expedite matters.
or blow up in our faces.
it's already blown up in mine.
I've got nothing to lose.
and therein lies the problem.
our business affiliation, selling the microchips, was very profitable.
it's all behind us now.
you know perfectly well I can't proceed beyond the assignment until it's complete.
drop the good-soldier crap.
you're a turncoat now, wanted by your own country.
so just forget about the girl.
I wish I could.
wish harder.
I don't get it, Cole. Success has made you...
what?
crazy, cocky or just sloppy?
you didn't have to kill the hit man.
I assigned him a task, and he failed.
you're not getting Barrett.
Gibbs has her and DiNozzo in a safe house.
place called Old Rag Mountain.
you sure?
per SECNAV.
even for a politician, he talks too much.
I'm giving you this heads-up out of loyalty.
and in return, you want me to leave so you're not implicated.
I want you to leave so neither of us ends up in Leavenworth.
again, sir.
I wish I could.
but no loose ends.
I got to finish what we started.
come on, boy. Come on, let's go. Easy.
same technique as used on Dane before his fall from the window.
same knife?
it would appear so.
it was plunged in here, and then twisted around.
perforated both lungs.
this caused massive internal bleeding.
no way Latham here was gonna draw a breath, much less call for help.
Latham let him get closeHe trusted him.
well, trust was his first mistake.
that a microchip?
Oh, yeah, but no longer active, so you can add it to the collection.
it's interesting.
well, locating Stratton, or Cole, as you now call him-- easier said than done.
guy's a phantom.
go catch a ghost.
all I wanted for breakfast was the coffee.
now we're ready for a fair fight.
always good to be prepared.
I've been prepared for months.
with Cole on the loose, I think it's time to bring out some Connery, and I'm paraphrasing.
you never bring a knife to a gunfight. Huh?
James Bond?
untouchables, 1987.
connery won an Academy Award for that.
I liked him in, uh, Xanadu.
you know, one of these days, I'd like to actually meet someone who appreciates movies the way I do.
or at least appreciates the way I appreciate them.
she does, Tony.
who?
agent Ziva David believes that the Pirates of the Caribbean is a cinema classic.
I'm not talking about movies, Tony, I'm talking about you.
she cares.
what's the matter with you? We're-We're coworkers.
Yeah.
we're teammates.
we have each other's backs.
exactly.
surround yourself with people you would give your own life for.
boss... - Shot fired.
Ziva, McGee, move in.
I have visual!
got the shot, take it!
what's he got, a cannon?
sounds like a . 50-caliber round.
a gun that size has limited accuracy.
he seems pretty damn accurate to me.
all right, suppressive fire.
keep him moving in the same direction.
go for it.
I'm sorry for your loss, Gibbs.
it's wrong place, wrong time.
Yeah, you got that right.
we're ready, Boss.
game on?
game over.
how are you, DiNozzo?
I'm good.
so Latham took SECNAV's bait?
Yeah.
Yeah, gave up Old Rag Mountain.
that's 20 miles east.
Jarvis must be one hell of a liar.
well, I'm glad he's lying for us.
time to move?
no. Time to stop running.
Ziva and I are going out for a drink later, if you care to join us.
I would, but, uh, I got a stop to make before I head home.
home, huh?
finally got to call my mom.
home's waiting for me.
need a ride?
SECNAV set me up.
car service.
fancy.
so, come on, you can say it.
I'll miss you most of all, Scarecrow.
wizard of Oz.
look at you.
how far you've come.
I'm so proud of you.
we've been down this Yellow Brick Road before, Tony.
thanks again.
take care of yourself.
always do.
don't disappear.
irons really necessary?
I thought you'd be flattered.
phantom program did a lot of good in the world, Gibbs.
I did a lot of good in service to my country.
did.
you and Latham forgot that.
some very bad people.
doing very bad things, until you came along.
it's worth taking into consideration, no?
should count for something.
it should. It doesn't. not anymore
I don't know where you went off the rails, Stratton, but it brought you here.
you're no better than them now.
deep down, Gibbs- and-and maybe not that deep-- you're no different than me.
I don't kill innocent people for money.
no?
so why do you kill innocent people?
south of the border
down Mexico way
that's where I fell in love
where the stars above came out to play.
so
EJ is, uh... gone, huh?
and safe, for a change.
may I ask where?
someplace quiet.
with someone she can count on.
hopefully.
that is the word, is it not?
hopefully, Even when you think you can count on someone, you often cannot.
do I detect a blip on the Ray-dar?
I would rather not discuss it.
well, at least EJ and I parted friends.
agent Cruz seems to have, uh, some communication issues.
Yeah, and I'm losing my patience.
as you well should.
you know you and I, we have a lot in common, in that respect.
you think?
I don't think.
I know.
well, then I am, uh, grateful to have someone in my life who is just as romantically dysfunctional as I am.
agent David, do you really consider me to be in your life?
no. - Yes.
Seriously?
I mean, what should I say?
say "hello.
okay.
excuse me.
Hello?
um, no, I can talk, yeah.
morning, Gladys, Colonel.
stay warm.
morning, Elaine.
Hey, Gibbs.
you missed one hell of an accident.
Yeah. Driver fell asleep.
beat up his rig pretty bad.
well, at least he's alive.
eggs easy?
no, just coffee.
finish that, I'll brew you fresh to go.
you're too good to me, Elaine.
Oh, I'm just waiting on a proposal. That's all.
federal agent. Put it down.
will you listen to what I'm asking you?!
Matteson- is that right?- I'm Shannon.
Jethro! - I miss you, Daddy.
they're both dead.
No!
your wife and daughter died in the crash.
daddy!
like the blue better, huh?
NCIS! - Why me, Gibbs?
you're not infallible, Jethro.
I'll keep you safe, Abby.
hello Probie.
Gibbs. Found something.
grab your gear.
got a dead sailor in Norfolk.
dad.
hey there.
well, how do I look?
alive.
hell of a thing, isn't it?
what are you doing, probie?
hesitating like that.
you should have shot him.
what? I mean...
that's it?
it's over?
well, I-I wasn't, uh... I wasn't done yet.
that's the problem.
folks want to help you see the things you accomplished.
understand the choices you made.
Jethro... this is your life we're talking about.
didn't expect to see you so soon, Gunny.
guess you can't predict these things.
I didn't see this coming.
ain't life grand?
what is this, Mike?
a gift.
well, it doesn't feel like it.
people want to give you closure.
a chance to see what you did.
I didn't do anything.
bull.
you solved hundreds of cases.
you helped families get over burying their dead by putting away murderers and terrorists.
I'm just doing my job.
well, folks use, uh, paper clips and photocopy for a living.
those are jobs.
what you did is more than that.
I don't get it.
try to.
done things different, you'd be surprised how everything would have changed.
how far do we have to go?
30 years? Ten years?
what about yesterday?
tell me how it started.
like every other day - nothing unusual.
this is definitely unusual.
"unusual" is the operative word.
what are you two doing?
don't play dumb, Tim.
we're trained federal agents. We can see when something's up.
and something's definitely up.
what are you two talking about?
the two computer monitors on your desk.
you swapped them, and no one just up and changes their viewing angle.
something's up, McAnal Probie.
my monitors - that's what you're worried about?
we're not big on change around here.
well, I thought I would try a little something different today.
what makes today so special?
we know that look, McGee.
it is somewhere between melancholy and constipation.
Consternation?
no, I actually meant that his mind looks clogged.
well, it's not. I just needed a change.
don't change, McGee.
let's go. Dead petty officer, USS Gentry.
the Gentry, boss?
it's been out of commission for weeks.
it's in dry dock for repair. There's no crew.
there is a skeleton crew, McGee.
empty ship. Why is there a body on board?
you change your monitor or something, McGee?
the electronic hub of the ship's communications and operations system.
only the ship's captain, the XO and a handful of crew members are allowed access.
and our victim was none of the above.
by the way, not the best place to discharge a firearm.
ka-blooey.
doctor, should we be wearing Hazmat suits?
there's no leakage in here, Mr. Palmer, save for our victim's blood.
I got two shell casings here, Ducky. Does that match your body?
from what I can tell, yes.
however, Mr. Palmer, let's get her back to autopsy, make our findings definitive.
Yeah.
navy regulations prohibit the carrying of firearms except for watch standers.
well, didn't do her much good anyway.
search for bullets or fragments of.
witnesses?
everybody on board was working aft.
there was a welder who heard something, but he didn't check until it was too late.
who else?
skeleton crew.
there's ten, plus the guards at the ramp.
quarterdeck watch?
ship's security didn't see anybody leave.
I even checked their video surveillance.
means whoever did this could still be on board.
over here.
bag and tag.
he's alive.
McGee! Get Ducky.
think it's our shooter, boss?
I don't know yet.
plenty of time to rest later, probie.
you think?
I - I don't follow, Mike.
I didn't ask for this.
of course you didn't. You earned it.
how?
by making some tough decisions.
everything happens for a reason.
people die needlessly - I know that.
but sometimes good comes from the hurt.
don't talk to me like a greeting card.
I'm talking to you like a friend.
okay.
now what?
come on.
move!
where?
why are we here?
one decision can change everything.
sometimes not.
what's your point?
there's a point to everything.
just got to find it.
agent Todd's dead.
doesn't have to be.
what if you saw Ari on that rooftop?
shooter!
you okay?
I just got shot at point-blank range, DiNozzo. What do you think?
you're not going to Pilates class tomorrow.
and that wasn't point-blank range.
McGee. Get air support. We got a sniper.
okay.
stay down, Kate.
dang. This is good.
why didn't you ever bring me here?
you mean to tell me that Ari never took the shot?
he never hit Kate?
couldn't.
this time, you saw him, stopped him.
it didn't happen that way.
but what if it did?
what if, this time, you protected your team and kept it from happening?
Kate's alive.
I know what you're thinking: Kate doesn't die, a lot of things would be different.
did I miss it?! - Everything's fine.
I promised her I wouldn't miss it.
you were undercover.
I know. I should have let you do it. What was I thinking?!
I'm family first!
everything works out, Tony.
look at me and Tim, okay?
this was meant to be.
okay.
Oh, well, Agent DiNozzo.
glad to see you made it.
everything okay?
see for yourself.
Hey, Kate. Sorry.
uh, drug deals, you know? They never go according to plan.
well, at least... you look smaller.
What?! - Oh, boy.
exactly.
congratulations, Agent DiNozzo.
you're a father.
welcome.
nice job, Kate.
life's dominoes.
ripples like a stone skipping across a pond.
and you're the catalyst.
think about Ziva.
Kate lives, Ziva would have stayed Mossad.
be careful with this one.
I know her father well.
to say she's dangerous is an understatement.
dangerous women are my specialty, Leon.
Oh, I'm familiar with your specialty, Tony.
I remember you.
Riva? Viza?
no, no, no, no. Tiva.
my name is Ziva David.
Oh, yeah... Ziva, the icy Israeli.
I followed you to a hotel pool once.
clearly, I made an impression.
cannot say the same about you.
no way.
no, you're not blaming me for everything.
I didn't say everything.
but we're just as responsible for the things we do as the things we don't.
yesterday was an eye-opener.
there was more to that case than you saw coming.
this can't be good.
cleaned out his desk, too.
albatross!
albatross!
petty Officer Janet McCaffrey had a spotless record.
ZIVA: Uh, two deployments on two different ships: the Ontario and the Gentry.
so it's finally happened.
you two are snooping together as a team.
we are merely curious and concerned.
well, it's nothing you need to know about.
there's plenty I need to know about. Like our dead petty officer.
pulled our victim's bank records, boss.
two deposits in the last week.
both over $30, 000.
from where? - Still checking.
civilian?
Peter Germaine. Still in the ICU at Washington General.
background?
McGee: Germaine works for a shipbuilding firm out of Portsmouth.
his company was just absorbed by a Hong Kong-based electronics company.
the Chinese.
Takeover's still pending.
there's a security concern regarding a foreign entity operating on a U. S.military installation.
and before any ship undergoes repairs, sensitive information is supposed to be removed.
including most hard drives.
most?
well, according to the data logs, the Gentry's surveillance drives are still intact.
treason, boss?
could be our two shooters had an agreement that went sour.
sweet and sour.
we need to talk to those Chinese.
exactly.
I'll tell Director Vance.
Yeah, Abbs, I'm on the way.
Hey, Gibbs.
you feel better, Jimmy, or should I do it again?
do what again?
sorry, Agent Gibbs.
I pulled my oblique while extracting Petty Officer McCaffrey down the ladder off the Gentry, and, uh, Abby's been Rolfing me.
Rolfing you?
Yeah.
uh, yeah.
uh... I'm gonna go down to Autopsy.
Rolfing, Abbs?
so, um, Ducky and Jimmy dug out the two slugs that killed Petty Officer McCaffrey and the round found in our wounded civilian Peter Germaine.
I analyzed and compared all three.
and guess what?
they all look the same.
exactly.
all three slugs came from the same gun, this one.
someone else shot them, Gibbs, and then they left the gun there to make it look like Germaine did it.
the Glock registered, Abbs?
Nope. And the serial number is filed off.
so when I wasn't Rolfing Jimmy, I was able to lift a partial latent print off the casing.
meet... Michael Rose.
freelance systems analyst.
does a lot of work with Navy Intel.
all three had clearance to board.
maybe they were all in it together.
nice work.
who knew Palmer had abs like that?
DiNozzo? - Yeah, boss?
we know no one left the ship.
we're looking for Michael Rose. Find him.
well, you can forget it, 'cause I'm not taking the blame for every coulda, shoulda, didn't, Mike.
I-I... I didn't order this.
well, sometimes we don't know what we want till someone shows us the possibilities.
chocolate.
my mom used to do this.
What'd you say your name was?
that was my mother's name.
hurt my feelings if you don't eat it.
no, I can't...
mom.
poor thing.
brain must be running in circles trying to make sense of all this.
and here I am, not a day older than the last time you saw me carrying on about a mother's pride.
my goodness.
you never told me you were proud.
proud of the boy I knew, proud of the man you've become, and proud of everything in-between.
how about I wrap this up?
you can take it home with you.
do I get to go home?
I do have one bone to pick with you, though.
it's dangerous!
What?!
you never... - You could've cut him some slack.
dad blamed you for everything. He hated you for leaving.
well, trust me, he had one foot out the door already.
so, he drove a few women home.
God knows, I put your father through hell.
man that age shouldn't be changing his wife's bed sheets every night.
best thing I did was go.
no, don't you say that.
it's true.
course, raising a son is hard, but doing it on your own, you're gonna need a couple miracles for things to turn out right.
just ask Michael Rose.
tell me about Michael Rose.
42, lives in McLean, Virginia.
divorced. Single dad.
computer systems analyst for the government, which evidently doesn't pay well enough, because Rose has some major money problems.
no money in his checking account and he's facing foreclosure on his home.
rose has a son named Stephen.
he's 17 years old.
an honor student who is currently applying to colleges.
son's bank account?
only a savings account listed, boss.
new deposits?
rose deposited $20, 000 48 hours ago.
I talked to his coworkers.
they haven't seen him, and his voicemail is full.
outgoing calls?
three last night.
one to his son, the other two to secure diplomatic lines in D. C.
the Chinese embassy.
Ziva, go find this kid.
McGee, get back to the Gentry.
find DiNozzo. Help him locate Michael Rose.
computer monitors, clandestine meetings in Vance's office.
you're up to something, McDevious, I can tell.
wait a second.
are you finally getting that sex-change operation?
good for you, McGee.
or is it McShe?
no judgment. I'm proud of you.
look, Director Vance offered me a job promotion, okay?
as head of the Cyber Division in Okinawa.
that's it?
Yes.
everybody knows that, Tim. Good for you.
it's fantastic.
you got to take that opportunity.
the last cyber-agent, he's at Microsoft now.
Yeah, as head of security. The guy's a rock star.
let's not get carried away, but yeah.
why are you being so normal about this?
your sincerity's disconcerting.
you prefer I'd attack you with some kind of sarcastic, hostile remark?
sort of, yeah.
what do I do?
it's your choice.
but I'd trust my gut.
that's what Gibbs would do.
see ya. - All right, man.
Hey, Stephen, we need to talk.
I do not play lacrosse.
who are you?
look, lady, I'm sorry.
my dad said I have to protect myself.
from whom?
the Chinese.
he said we might have trouble.
trouble connecting the dots, Jethro?
the newspaper, what's it say?
blank.
that's 'cause you haven't decided yet.
I haven't decided what?
how things will play out.
see, it's all intertwined, Jethro.
you'd be surprised how one decision ripples into another.
it's your ship to sail, son.
I didn't pull the trigger yet.
hmm, nope, sure didn't.
I wish I'd known all this before.
learned from it.
doesn't work that way, son.
well, like it or not, you made a difference in folks' lives.
certainly did mine.
albeit short.
I never wanted to leave you.
tell me you know that.
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I know that.
what are you in the mood for, Gibbs?
rock? Jazz?
always been a big band fan myself.
let me guess.
after all this nonsense today, you're more interested in a choir of angels?
who are you, Riley? You the ghost of NCIS past?
please. You think I wanted to be here?
nobody invited you. - Oh, think again.
you did.
that's how it works. Whether you realize it or not, I'm here because you need me.
I need a crook and a murderer?
I think this conversation's done.
Mexico?
ring a bell?
you can play dumb all you like, but I know better.
you let your emotions get the better of you that day, Gibbs.
damn foolish, if you ask me.
give me a quarter.
for what? - God bless it! Give me a damn quarter.
fond memories, Riles?
at least I'm not haunted by mine.
I got a proposition for you. - Oh, I can't wait.
what if you didn't pull that trigger at all?
think about all the lies, Gibbs.
think about all you did for the sake of revenge.
and then imagine it never happened at all.
I had to.
killing that man made you as guilty as he was.
I'm not saying what you did wasn't warranted, but we both know what's considered just isn't always right.
and if it didn't happen?
well, think about it.
for one thing, Miss Sciuto wouldn't be carrying around the secret of a lifetime.
no one needs to know the truth about the Hernandez investigation.
I'm willing to do anything for you.
I just need you to tell me what to do.
maybe this time I did more harm than good.
I can't argue with that.
if I didn't do it, where would that have put me?
Riley... I need to know.
varsity lacrosse, huh? - Yes, sir.
afterschool job, too, waiting tables.
just trying to help.
you're an honest kid, Stephen.
how about your dad?
he as honest as you are?
what do you mean?
you had no idea he was selling secrets to the Chinese?
that's not true. M-My dad's a good man.
he just got pulled in with some bad people.
who? - I don't know their names.
okay, then why?
money trouble, bankruptcy, me getting ready for college.
maybe he got wrapped up in something bad, but he'd never hurt anybody.
I need to know where he is.
he called last night.
he sounded scared. Told me to be careful.
Oh, please, you got to believe me. You got to help him.
daddy!
Oh, for Pete's sakes, probie. Stop embarrassing yourself.
it's done. Let it go.
no. I can't.
I did what I thought was right.
well, what was right was wrong. And we all make mistakes.
Where's McCallister?
Aw, hell. Was that opinionated jackass here?
I figured he'd bring this up.
what would have happened if Hernandez didn't die?
to him? - To me.
it's not good. - Tell me.
if you hadn't shot him, it would've eaten you up.
man carries around his demons long enough, they start to take over.
what?
you're alive, Jethro.
it's been months since anyone's spoken to you.
nothing to say.
so, how are you, boss?
I'm not your boss, McGee. I haven't been your boss in years.
the boat's still here. What have you been working on?
rocker... hope chest. I was painting here.
and what are you hoping for?
to be left alone.
guess that didn't work.
is this for Kate's baby?
you missed the shower.
and the birth.
What'd she have? - A girl.
eight pounds, six ounces.
she named her Kelly.
guess you'll want to stay for supper.
well, we don't have to, but... - Good,'cause I don't want you here.
Abby and I made you gumbo and bread pudding last night.
it's my mother's recipe.
we'd love for you to come see our new place.
Jethro, you're missed.
perhaps it's about time you stopped thinking about yourself and started to think about the ones who love you.
I've missed these.
is this one of those interventions? - Gibbs, no.
good. Then get out. I don't want your pity.
what do you want?
said it yourself, Jethro. Did what you had to.
I shot the son of a bitch, Mike.
but when I got home, my house was empty.
and my girls were still gone.
mom mentioned Michael Rose. Why bring all this up now?
folks do the wrong things for the right reasons.
you of all people should understand that.
maybe you and Michael Rose aren't so different.
it's been hours, boss. We've checked every inch.
thermals pick up anything? - Search!
some of the cleaning chemicals are generating heat, throwing off the read.
Vance said he spoke to the Chinese embassy.
let me guess. They denied Rose even called?
they said they never got the messages.
agent Gibbs? Good dog, good dog.
heel, heel.
michael Rose, NCIS.
we've got your son out here with us.
dad?
dad, I... I-I told them you didn't do anything wrong.
they just... they just want to help. Please.
leave Stephen out of this.
I'll-I'll tell you everything.
you look kind of lost.
I do?
well, you look pretty smart.
my mom said we should help.
Where's your mom? - She's over there.
come on. I'll take you to her.
this little girl belong to you?
Yep. Belongs to you, too, I think.
come on, Daddy. Sit.
we've been waiting for you.
is that for me?
it's us again.
Germaine just died in ICU.
two dead, your Glock.
I thought it would be easy.
I mean, I knew the Gentry was in dry dock. The three of us had a plan.
McCaffrey was already on board. Germaine had the connection to the Chinese.
and you figured you could handle the download?
they paid me.
but, as the meeting got closer...
you realized you couldn't.
I realized it wasn't just information I was selling. It was people's safety.
it was... it was my honor.
you could have asked for help. - Tried.
I tried to call the Chinese embassy that night. I tried to back out.
and when we went to the ship to erase the hard drive, they were already there.
that's... that's when the shooting started.
you killed them.
I killed them in self-defense.
I killed them and probably saved thousands of others.
that your confession, Mr. Rose? - Is it?
how could I look my son in the eye and tell him that I lost our house and that I couldn't send him to college?
we needed the money, Agent Gibbs.
I was trying to save my family.
that's a nice family.
I didn't see this coming.
I always knew it would happen, eventually.
seeing you here, I shouldn't have let it happen.
I shouldn't have let you testify.
I wanted to help, Gibbs.
I wanted to put that drug dealer in jail.
I should have known better. - It wasn't about you.
it was about this family.
it wasn't your decision, Daddy.
if we hadn't died, you wouldn't have joined NIS, and you wouldn't have become an agent.
none of that mattered.
no Tony, no Ziva, no team.
but I'd have had my girls.
I'd have had you.
if you stayed a Marine, Gibbs, the loss would have fallen on us instead.
Kelly, baby, dinner's almost ready. Go wash up.
mom, can I have a few more minutes?
what would your dad say if he was here?
he'd say,"Don't mess with mess," young lady.
that's right. And he'll be back stateside in two weeks, so get used to it.
mommy?
who is it?
just think of all the cases, all of the lives you've touched, Gibbs.
you sacrificed everything to help those people.
but I wanted both.
it doesn't work like that.
go.
and my dad? Can't you help him?
you talked to my father.
you can see the kind of man he is.
he was just trying to do what's right.
he killed two people. Nothing right about that.
good people do things sometimes.
you won't help him, will you?
it's your decision, Agent Gibbs.
morning, Elaine. - Hey, Gibbs.
you missed a hell of an accident.
semi, huh? - Yeah, driver fell asleep.
beat up his rig pretty bad.
well, at least he's alive.
eggs easy?
no, just coffee.
finish that, I'll brew you fresh to go.
you're too good to me, Elaine.
Oh, I'm just waiting on a proposal. That's all.
federal agent. Put it down.
we all make choices.
your decision. What's it gonna be?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
guess you weren't done yet, probie.
well, McGee-san, you have something to tell us?
actually, I do.
I am not taking the job promotion in Okinawa.
McGee, why? That is a tremendous opportunity.
well, no disrespect to our coworkers in Japan, but I still think there's more I can do here.
that, my friend, is very noble.
nice decision, Tim.
but you are missing on some of the finest Geisha girls and sashimi the world has to offer.
what's the matter with you? - A lot happens around here, Tony.
I'd hate to miss it.
you're not going to miss a thing, McGee. Got a dead Marine in DC.
grab your gear.
are you sure, Gibbs? You were injured.
we can do this one without you.
I'm fine.
Yeah, I mean, we're happy to cover the crime scene, boss.
no, I'm good. - Boss, you had a really traumatic day yesterday.
my choice.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
light's still on.
you cut the alarm?
I cut the phone lines. Detectors won't signal the cops. It's cool.
you heard that?
somebody's up there.
Hey, you're cool, right?
no problem.
Hey, what the hell did you do, man?
that guy came out of nowhere!
come on, man, we got to go.
come on, man, move!
we got to go! - Oh, my God.
why are you so preppy?
well, probably because I went to boarding school.
but I think you mean "peppy."
and that's because it's L. E.S. day!
les?
l. E.S Leave and Earnings Statements.
Oh, you mean payday.
that's another way of putting it.
wait a second.
this isn't right. This isn't my L. E.S. It's McMoneybag's.
somehow he makes more money than me?
maybe they pay people what they're actually worth.
morning, Ziva, Tony.
how much do you make, Tim?
what are you doing with my L. E.S?
it was on my desk.
it's addressed to me - it's a Federal offense.
well, you know what I find offensive and more than a little strange, is that somehow you make $253 week more than me.
it's all about withholding.
Yeah.
what exactly are you withholding?
Yeah, you're withholding something, all right.
you're too smart to hack into the system and try and give yourself a little weekly bump, aren't you?
or should I call Fred Seymour in Accounting and find out?
hang up, DiNozzo.
time's money.
we've got a dead Navy reservist in Arlington.
boss, did you know that McGee makes more money than Ziva and me?
keep me out of this.
I know,he gives a lot to charity, and you should, too.
the DiNozzos are great humanitarians.
you know that.
we got a dead hu-man. Let's go.
was that a pun?
Hey, why are we being arrested?
breaking and entering.
but we didn't steal anything.
you shot the victim twice.
one missed, and the other just grazed him.
besides, he was already dead.
you sure about that?
he hanged himself, man,Come on.
we just happened to be here, man.
wrong place, wrong time.
look, we could've taken some of this stuff on our way out, but we didn't, man.
was there anybody else in the house?
I don't think so.
get 'em out.
man!
next time, I'm picking the place we hit.
interesting.
doc.
Hangingr the gunsho the math.
for centuries, hangings used a standard dead drop, but then in 1872, an Englishman named William Marwood calculated a formula using a man's height, weight and the distance dropped to ensure a cleanly snapped neck.
so who is our well-versed victim?
Dr. Robert Banks, psychologist and Navy reservist on active duty.
high-level security clearance at the Pentagon.
Dr. Banks here clearly used Marwood's formula and a double knot, thus ensuring the "hangman's fracture.
Yeah, hoping for instantaneous death.
his goal was to fracture the third and fourth vertebrae.
judging by the angle of the neck and the petechial hemorrhaging in his eyes, his efforts were successful.
but who shot him?
robbers.
well, then we'll have to see which killed him first, the bullet or the rope.
boss, local LEOs say there's a woman outside claims to be the victim's doctor.
let her in.
Dr. Kate's sister.
are you his doctor, Doctor?
Yeah, and his friend.
my condolences, Dr. Cranston.
Gibbs, found Banks's cell phone - you're not gonna believe who called him four times last night.
Dr. Cranston.
he hanged himself, huh?
looks that way.
well, whatever it looks like, Gibbs, you look deeper.
robert was one of the strongest people I knew.
he wouldn't do this; couldn't.
I know someone killed him.
so, you spoke to him last night, Doc?
several times.
about what?
I'm afraid the rules of confidentiality prevent me from giving you any details.
doctor, guy's dead.
robert was a brilliant psychologist.
we went to school together.
what about since then?
we were close colleagues.
his wife filed for divorce a few months ago.
he was having a difficult time prior to that as well.
at work? He have enemies?
he was consulting on a special project for the Pentagon.
what kind of project?
the kind that gets you killed, apparently.
M. I.S. O. Military Information Support Operations.
I'm old-school, Doc.
Psy-ops'll do.
Yeah, well, then you know ey use mind games to confuse and manipulate the enemy.
I know that.
credit card statements over the past few months show that he was writing prescriptions for himself.
Oh, not true.
that's the kind of background fabrication psy-ops excels at.
Really? And you know this because Banks invented it?
that what you and Banks talked about?
we talked about his divorce.
he wanted me to start seeing his daughter to help her get through it.
turns out he was having just as much trouble as she was.
he was getting increasingly anxious, but whenever I brought up his daughter, his panic would subside.
he lived for his little girl.
she was his hope, his whole reason for living.
people who have any hope at all, Gibbs, they don't take their own life, they embrace it.
banks didn't kill himself.
forgive me if I'm having a little trouble with this.
Bobby had been so unpredictable lately.
he just...
he just wanted Amber to be happy.
it's all because they broke up.
he still loved her.
you made this happen.
tell me about your relationship, Mrs. Banks.
why does any couple split after so many years?
we grew apart.
he'd become different.
he had become moody.
he wasn't the man that I married.
and he started to take it out on both of us.
mom...
you know he wasn't the same, Amber.
life insurance has you as the sole beneficiary.
Yeah. His, um, university and naval death benefits.
he had an additional policy, too.
$4 million for both of you.
but wouldn't the suicide change that?
no, no, not in this case , he had a policy that had an exclusion clause.
you sure you didn't know about the money?
Hey, finally.
you work with Fred Seymour in Accounting, right?
uh, you need an accountant?
you bet I do.
I got a salary dispute.
are you feeling overvalued or undervalued?
that's an interesting question.
it's not me, actually, it's McGee.
W's McGee?
my coworker.
the tall, pasty guy who wanders around sort of...
you know, he spends way too much time indoors. Needs light.
shouldn't I be talking to him?
technically.
that's a good point.
there's probably some underlying feelings of inadequacy between the tw of you, right?
no. What do you mean, inadequacy?
did your father ever tell you he loved you?
you're not from Accounting, are you?
why did you pretend to be?
I didn't.
you did. You just saw what you wanted to see.
I'm not sure I want to see you anymore.
are we breaking up already?
who are you?
I'm Dr. Samantha Ryan, DOD, Psy-ops Division.
I've been told to come and see a Special Agent Gibbs.
Yeah, you found him.
you a brain gamer, right?
that's head brain gamer to you.
I oversee all military information support operations.
I understand you're investigating the death of Dr. Robert Banks.
agent Gibbs, word in my office.
Hi, Leon.
Dr. Ryan, what a surprise.
you know Director Vance.
you seem to know everybody.
Yeah, it's my job.
Oh, Gibbs, feel free to ask Leon anything you want.
we go way back.
DiNozzo, escort Dr. Ryan to the conference room.
Dr. Cranston's waiting.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Director, you look good.
authority suits you.
I got a call from SECNAV.
Oh, great. - No, it wasn't.
somebody steal his golf bag?
secdef wants to know what NCIS is doing investigating an M. I.S. O. employee.
investigating a possible murder.
I know you're not big on fine lines, Gibbs, but I am.
this happens to be one of them.
dead guy's Navy, Leon.
that makes it ours.
so, how do you know Dr. Ryan?
long story.
love to hear it.
she's an old colleague. Let's just say we spent some time together at the war college . Ah, private time? - Classified time.
okay, okay, enough said.
be careful, e's inquisitive.
Yeah, well, so am I.
not like her.
do you exercise?
I walk. - Why?
because you look skinny.
skinnier than the last time I saw you.
gave up dairy.
I'm lactose-intolerant.
you always were into the latest fads.
well, it's not really a fad; it's a diagnosis.
so, anybody want coffee?
no milk - No milk
you two went to school together, right?
hmm, yes. Does that turn you on, Agent Gibbs?
a couple of coeds?
afterwards, she went clinical, and I went military.
very different points of view.
Oh, and, um, full disclosure: we both slept with Banks.
she was interested in his mind.
I... - She's doing it.
you're doing it.
I'm doing what?
Oh, the games. Thnonsense.
and I'm leaving.
no, no, you're not.
Sam, we think Dr. Banks was the victim of psy-ops scheme.
we?
he was my patient.
that's ridiculous. Is it?
agent Gibbs, I will answer any queson that you have, but not here and obviously not with her.
why not?
national security.
next meeting, my office, my rules. - My investigation.
my friend. - Our friend, Rachel.
banks was working with an M. I.S. O. field op named Mitchell on an assignment.
you probably should talk to him.
Yeah, Doug, I'm on my way.
Hey, Gibbs.
don't trust these people.
especially her.
I don't follow. Which part, Mitchell?
Dr. Banks can't be dead. I just spoke to him yesterday.
he's gone.
no. would've been informed.
DOD.
Pentagon.
there's a chain of communication that would've been engaged.
he's dead.
you are a reservist working for psy-ops, yes?
former Navy.
I'm not cut out for this head game stuff.
I can't do it anymore.
they're, uh...
they're reassigning me.
you worked with Dr. Banks for how long?
almost a year.
banks is a smart man and a good father.
he was going through a rough divorce, an ugly custody battle.
the doctor have any problems with his coworkers?
threats or disagreements?
look, this is a restricted M. I.S. O. field unit
all information is case-sensitive and has to be...
we're cleared.
answer the question.
it's a court order.
here.
former Marine Second Lieutenant Kyle Baxter.
received a general discharge six months ago because of a negative emotional stability eval.
who wrote it?
Dr. Banks, of course.
give me a verdict, Duck.
which came first, the chicken or the egg?
well, always been a chicken man myself.
Oh, that's my conundrum.
the heart continues to beat after a hanging for a few moments.
the doctor here was shot and continued to bleed.
now, with the amount of blood loss,I would hypothesize that the bullet hit him milliseconds after his neck was snapped clean by the rope.
definitely a suicide?
without doubt.
but he was only hastening the inevitable.
what are you saying?
his kidney and liver functions were deteriorating at an alarming rate.
based on what?
Abby is determining that.
suffice to say, had the doctor not taken his own life, I would estimate he had but six months to live.
Abby. - Hi, Gibbs.
it's called "scoundrel patter," courtesy of an Old West con man named Umbrella Jim Miner.
supposed to confuse the suckas.
Gibbs, watch closely - the hand is quicker than the eye.
attention given, I'll show you
how Abby hides the peek-a-boo.
I win.
so, I guess you're not a sucker.
or are you?
all of these pills came out of Banks' medicine cabinet.
one is a benign blood pressure medication.
the other two are dangerous psychotropic stimulants at have been wreaking havoc on his liver and his kidney functions.
I can't tell the difference.
somebody switched out his prescriptions, Gibbs.
it's like the oldest con in the book.
poor sucker. - Yeah.
so, Banks thinks that he's just taking his daily meds, when, in reality, he's taking drugs that have been proven to cause depression and increased mental instability.
psy-ops.
mind games.
he's being played, Abbs. Question is, by who?
chair works.
I like standing.
Whatlse do you like, Agent Gibbs? - Answers.
good. We make a great couple.
I like questions.
you want to tell me something about yourself?
no.
your life story makes you uncomfortable?
you know, nonverbal behaviors comprise 85% of all human communication.
and the most hont part of your body, believe itr not: your feet.
and yours, Agent Gibbs, are pointed directly at my door.
okay. I have a question for you.
speaks volumes.
do you like pancakes?
I love pancakes.
Dr. Ryan?
Yes, Special Age Gibbs, Ross Kilmer, my assistant;
Ross's specialty is to charm and disarm.
he has less patience than I do.
if he's country, I'm rock and roll; works out.
marine Lieutenant Kyle Baxter.
we're coming up empty - you got anything?
um...just about his psych eval.
that's it.
personnel list for the op Banks was working on.
you know what I really like, Doc?
paper.
I really love paper.
Where'd you find these?
one was hidden inside Banks' couch.
the other one was in his mattress.
Oh, wow, the milliguass reading's off the charts.
these are electromagnetic field emitters.
hm, someone tried to give our victim a tumor?
Yeah, more like headaches and nightmares.
high levels of EMF pollution can cause interference with REM sleep cycles.
I'll sleep when I'm dead
personnel files from Ryan.
list of possible killers, huh?
but we don't trust it, right?
run them anyway. Anything else from the house?
Yes. Found this from Banks' office safe: operations protocol for a top secret psy-ops mission.
it appears our victim was working on this last.
but the only person that could confirm that'll probably lie to your face.
I'm getting used to that.
McGee, connect the gizmos you found back to psy-ops.
I can track the parts, boss, but whoever built it most likely is gonna cover their tracks.
e - mail issues again?
trust issues.
from now on, I want paper from the source.
paper?
you heard the man, McGee.
he said he wants psy-ops personnel files.
a lot of them.
but any one of them could've planned Banks' murder.
this could take days.
weeks.
there's got to be a million personnel files here.
I don't even know where to begin without a search key.
well, I suggest we begin alphabetically.
could I get you a beer, Agent Gibbs?
no, I'm good.
you look nice.
I assume what you need to talk to me about can't wait till morning?
murders are time-sensitive.
general.
Dr. Banks took his own life.
and I'm not sure if this is the time or the place.
would you excuse me for just a moment?
wow, people in this town love to talk shop and eat cocktail weenies.
I, um, I get the impression by your hoodie that you don't really like parties that much.
no, I like parties, when there's something worth celebrating.
everything all right here, Doctor?
can I be of any assistance?
Oh, thank you, Ross.
um, Special Agent Gibbs needs to speak to me privately.
and I know just the place.
I'll, um, I'll just wait right here.
feel safe, Gibbs?
Oh, I guess not everyone in here has a security clearance.
you're enjoying this.
I'll play along.
what do you got?
removal of Threats Using Drugs and Alternative Methods.
it's a hell of a page-turner, Doc. A real how-to.
driving a sane person to suicide using pills and sleep-deprivation.
that sound familiar to you?
be very careful...
with what you're suggesting.
this is a page out of your own playbook, Doc.
so I'm gonna ask you again.
what do you know about the death of Robert Banks?
and I'm gonna tell you again.
nothing.
I'm giving you a chance to come clean, Dr. Ryan.
help solve the murder of a close friend.
I already told you the truth.
whose truth?
your sister used to look at me like that.
like what?
eh, the cat who ate the canary.
I didn't exactly tell you everything earlier, Gibbs.
lot of that going around.
during one of my sessions with Banks, he mentioned a sensitive national security issue.
Yep.
you still should've told me.
I know. I want to catch his killer.
that makes two of us.
it's not exactly a skiff, Doc, but it'll do.
there was a project called Operation Alborz.
okay.
details.
no idea.
what was Banks's involvement?
he didn't tell me.
well, what did he tell you?
I got the sense that someone wanted to make sure he couldn't discuss it with anyone, ever.
someone?
boss? - Yeah, McGee. Go.
I've been going through the military personnel files - all dead ends.
Ryan's info didn't help?
I'm shocked.
which brings us back to former Second Lieutenant Kyle Baxter, the guy who was drummed out of the Marines because of Banks.
pick him up.
we still can't find him.
Hello?
is there a problem?
Gibbs, if something's bothering you, I'd really prefer you tell...
is that a b...
good night, Ryan.
sleep tight.
former second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. Superior IQ.
scored off the charts onhe Officer QualifyinExam.
where is he now?
last known address was in Norfolk.
he was hand-picked by the M. I.S. O.
18 months ago for its secret ops unit.
headed by Banks.
Yeah. Until...?
well, Baxter was thrown out for antisocial behavior, violent tendencies.
eventually discharged from the Marines.
fell off the grid a few months after that.
no. - could...
no, McGee, we can't.
Where'd you get that, boss?
from my basement; it's a bug.
find out where it came from, the old-fashioned way.
you're ringing, McCheater.
boss, I only kept it on to monitor Baxter's incoming cell phone calls.
but this call's still live. - Where?
storefront, 600 block of Chapman Avenue; looks like a cafe.
that's five minutes from here. Tony, Ziva, go.
trace the bug.
with or without my...
who wants to know?
four minutes.
nice. You guys are good.
you're not Baxter.
absolutely not.
Ryan and I work together.
Gibbs knows.
Baxter left me his phone, wanted to see if you guys were, uh,tracking him.
you can have it.
he's got others.
Where's Baxter now?
you got me.
I wish you luck, though.
you think we're just gonna let you walk away?
well, yeah.
why not?
beautiful day.
you guys have a good one.
a resort in Cancun?
Hey, you guys. - Hi, Mrs. Ryan.
how did you know where my son went to school?
his records are all classified.
did you follow me?
are you following me now? Am I under surveillance, Gibbs?
you hacked my records.
this is my personal life!
psy-ops 101.
you approach people at their most vulnerable.
you even the playing field, Doc.
Oh, you don't want to play with me, Gibbs, trust me.
I keep things confidential for a reason.
I take precautions because I have to.
and my son is off limits.
so is my place.
you don't like your own medicine, Doc?
I am not the enemy!
you bugged my home!
tell us about Operation Alborz.
as I shared with Agent Gibbs - national security.
mountain range in Iran.
some of the highest peaks.
apparently, very beautiful.
people flock from all over... - Less size, Doc, more pop.
after we invaded Iraq in 2003, Iran started pouring billions into their nuclear program.
recruited scientists to produce plutonium for them.
the Alborz mission was to use psy-op techniques to destabilize Iranian nuclear scientists.
cripple the enemy without firing a shot.
21st century warfare.
and the Iranians got wind?
possible.
and you think they could've done the same thing to Dr. Banks in retribution.
look, I'll do whatever I can to help you find Robert's killer.
I want this over as much as you do.
Gibbs, get over here.
I processed Banks' laptop.
the encryption was, like, super complex.
but you got in.
I did with a little help.
I just followed the tracks of someone else that hacked his computer, like, way before I did.
someone was wreaking havoc on Banks' life using his own computer.
like, draining his accounts and buying stocks that he never ordered, sending threatening e - mails.
more mind games.
Yeah. Even if he googled something, he would get misinformation.
like bogus sports scores and even fictional news stories.
he wasn't only being drugged, his entire reality was being manipulated.
by who?
from what I can tell, someone in Mexico.
I traced a ghost I. P. address to a room in a resort in Cancun.
the security video is a little blurry, but I got an instant hit with facial recognition.
the same guy Mitchell implicated, and the same guy that Banks gave a bad psych eval to.
Gibbs, this is the guy we're looking for.
boss. Can I?
go, McGee.
embargo's over.
James Drenden? Who is that?
that's the alias Kyle Baxter was using.
got a hit on a passport under Baxter's alias.
says he was on a flight arriving from Mexico City to Dulles two months ago.
two months is a long time.
he could be anywhere by now.
well, according to the IRS, he's currently employed as a bartender in Georgetown.
why would Baxter still be using the same alias?
honestly, Gibbs, had I known you were looking for me, I would have been here days ago.
Yeah. Spare me the psy-ops charm, Baxter.
we can prove you were in Mexico.
okay, so?
so, drugs found in Banks's system were manufactured close to the resort.
you had the expertise.
and you were messing with him.
Yeah, they're good.
you're looking at a psyps packa here, sir.
you can't trust that.
so, they set you up to take the fall?
obviously.
look, Banks discharged me with violent tendencies. Next thing you know, I'm the fall guy.
and you took the bait, hook, line and sinker.
now, why wouldn't they frame me? It's perfect.
prove that you're telling the truth.
may I?
I never left my phone or that matchbook.
call this number.
ask Simon.
he'll straighten it out.
Baxter was the best damn C. I.we've ever had, Director Vance.
for how long?
he's been workingndercover with the DEA for the past 12 months.
helped us shut down smugglers we've been after forever.
he was under DEA control for the last year?
had our eyes on him the whole time.
if you think he was involved with this, you're wrong.
somebody real good's been playing you folks.
so the person Dr. Ryan has been pushing, Gibbs, isn't our killer.
Cranston's sessions with Banks.
she's a quack.
no, she's not.
she's good, and it made listening all the harder,'cause he was in real trouble.
is that your apology about Baxter?
I have a job to do.
NCIS was looking into aa at a critical time.
we have protocols in place to protect our mission.
it's part of our rule book.
Yeah, well, I got some rules of my own, too.
rule number 42...
don't ever accept an apology from someone who just sucker-punched you.
I didn't apologize.
do you have children?
I did.
but you already know that.
Yes.
and I'm sorry.
Hey, Doc, my feet aren't pointing at the door.
the other day, I was picking up my son, Parker, from soccer practice, and he was walking toward the car, and not once did he look over his shoulder.
and that meant everything to me.
in my job, I take precautions, and I don't know how you found him, but I believe everybody deserves one secret.
and I'm asking you if I can have this one.
okay.
thank you. I owe you assuming you'll let me know when you want to collect.
I want to collect now.
someone with your knowledge killed Banks.
I want to know who.
whoever it is has lost sight of who we are and what we do.
you got a name?
good luck.
Banks's psy-ops files are blocked, deleted or in no-go territory.
here.
try this.
it's Ryan's cell phone.
isolate calls from psy-ops, government-issuelines.
there's five or six different numbers here.
cross-reference with incoming calls to Banks over the past month.
uh, there's just one, boss, and they've placed multiple calls to Banks over the past two weeks.
no. Brian Mitchell.
the psy-ops liaison who was working with him directly.
no, wait a minute - there's a second cell number on Banks' account, and Mitchell sent dozens of tech streams to it.
put it up.
I can't. They've all been erased.
Ziva, you're with me.
they're in the cloud memory, but it'll take time.
DiNozzo, dial both numbers three times, hang up after one ring.
boss?
do it.
and keep sending me locations on Mitchell's cell.
it's a fail-safe call.
it's an old spy craft trick.
means something's going wrong.
parties are supped to meet at a predetermined location.
kind of a rookie move, isn't it?
Yeah. That's why it just might work.
why did you call me, Brian?
I came as soon as I could.
we agreed it wouldn't be safe.
this will never work.
you'll never have what you want if you don't listen.
you know what I want.
you don't deserve it.
you messed up big-time.
I made your father look unstable.
I gave him the drugs; I did what you said.
I said to make it look like he killed himself.
if they figure out I'm involved, I'll get nothing.
I want that money.
I just want you to be happy.
I want us to be happy.
this isn't about us anymore.
you killed my father, Brian.
I will not go down with you for this.
Oh, I'm afraid you are.
put your hands behind your back.
she's as guilty as I am.
he's lying.
no, he,he forced me to do this.
somehow, I doubt that.
that's a nice girl.
30 years, take her home to meet the folks.
amber used me, just like she used him.
and I never saw it coming.
I thought she was another broken teenager caught up in an ugly divorce.
doc.
you look for the good in people.
there there's not much to find.
Hey, Ziva and I are going for drinks.
you want to come?
only if you're buying.
agent DiNozzo.
Fred Seymour from Accounting!
actually, good news.
we traced the problem back to a clerical error, which resulted in overpayments to you, Agent McGee.
now the bad news.
thanks to your request that we review your file, uh, we discovered that we've been short on your FICA withholdings for the previous five years.
what? - So you owe us $2, 997. 33. Payable immediately.
enjoy your night.
What?!
we'll be at the bar if you want to drown your srows.
what the...? What?
Yeah. Gibbs.
what are you doing?
well. I'm sleeping. It's 4: 00 in the morning. What are you doing?
trying out my new phone.
my other one disappeared.
yeah? That what happened, huh?
sorry.
I don't get much sleep.
I've got a lot on my mind.
whose head you messing with tonight, Doc?
probably my own.
I shouldn't have called.
how can I help?
I just wanted to thank you for figuring out what happened to Robert.
doing my job.
I think you already knew, though.
you make people feel safe, Gibbs.
it's a gift.
well, people need answers.
I need breakfast.
okay. When?
how about now?
well, I know a little diner that's open 24 hours.
perfect.
are you asking me on a date, Ryan?
it's the middle of the night, Agent Gibbs.
you tell me.
what about Klowny cakes?
fresh out. - Those things never sell.
must be those teenagers I've been telling you about.
light fingers.
I think I know who's got the light fingers around here.
what are you talking about?
Ethel, they're back.
those kids are after the beer.
no use hiding, punks!
had a blast last night. Can't wait for more.
I think they want to meet up again.
uh, it was sort of a... one-time thing for me, McGee.
Oh, come on, admit it, Tony. You had fun.
it was a more social experience than I expected.
so, you two did end up going out last night?
how'd you know about that?
I have hearing like a horse.
hawk.
a horse's hearing, McGee, is one of their keenest senses.
which is why you must "horse whisper."
I don't think that's right.
where did you two end up going last night?
well, actually... - Went to a bar.
well... I like bars.
Oh, girls want to know if we're on for Friday night.
"we"? Okay, one second.
since when did you two start picking up women together?
you wouldn't understand the science behind a good wingman, Ziva.
all right, McGoose, tell the girls Maverick says,"Game on."
maverick. Top Gun.
McGoose. - I can't believe you two.
truth is stranger than fiction.
grab your gear.
missing crew of Ghostrunner 12 just washed ashore.
didn't that helicopter go down four days ago?
Yeah. Come on, let's go.
by the time the ambulance got here, I had found the other two on the beach, washed up.
only three survivors?
the first one stumbled into the store.
he was the only one conscious.
the other two were... passed out.
dry as a bone.
no sweat.
sunstroke. - And bad.
EMTs rushed them all to the hospital.
they say anything?
guy in the store just kept muttering about someone named Happ.
Yeah, well, that's the pilot.
fourth crew member.
guess he's still missing, then.
I heard about the crash last week on the news.
never put two and two together till I talked to your other agent.
lots of letters like you.
she got here before you did.
according to the report last week, the helicopter crew was running a routine training operation off the USS Seahawk.
didn't they send a distress signal?
they did, but Coast Guard rescue operations didn't find anything.
there is still liquid inside.
hard to believe there'd be any fresh water left.
Waterworld.
Kevin Costner drinks his own urine.
smell it.
told you.
let me guess.
gross movie trivia works with women in bars?
well, something must,'cause Tim and I have a pretty fierce date on Friday night, and I have to say we are a force of nature.
I see. So women are just waiting for this masculine force?
pretty much, yeah.
okay.
so, if it's that easy, I want you to pick up the next woman you see.
that's juvenile, and I'm more mature than that now.
well, if either of you manages to get a date,
I will do both of your case reports for the entire month.
Why? What do you get out of it?
game on.
this a game to you, DiNozzo?
um, Agent Borin.
just sort of surprised to see you here.
well, you shouldn't be, because I've been running point on all search-and-rescue ops for the last four days.
read the briefings, DiNozzo.
got it. Thanks.
that was one of my agents I sent along for the ambulance ride.
did the crew say anything?
amidst the delirious ramblings, yeah.
apparently, the helicopter was hit by a second aircraft.
so we're looking for more than a missing pilot.
what happened up there?
that's what we have to figure out.
tribune or Herald?
times.
which one?
does it matter?
they're all just calling about the helo.
I'm surprised we haven't heard from ZNN.
usually, they're the first ones to...
Oops.
what?
we got real work to do. Like finding the mystery aircraft.
I know.
so let's stick with the crew we actually know something about.
I pulled service records on our missing helicopter pilot, Lieutenant Commander Oliver Happ.
and then we got files on the three who washed up.
the crew chief, Petty Officer Josie Sparks; copilot, Lieutenant Hank Joplin;
and rescue swimmer, Petty Officer Adam Portis.
rescue swimmer.
there's a job skill you hope you never have to use.
speaking of job skills...
what's this?
rubbers for your date with Borin.
Oh, extra large.
you knew my size.
thank you, Ziva, but I don't think we need your help.
maybe not. But Borin does.
she wanted extra hands with debris collection, and so I volunteered the two of you.
unless, of course, you would rather me say that the wingmen had to pull out.
pilots pull up.
I meant exactly what I said.
don't answer that. - Don't bother.
agent David.
Yes.
thank you.
that wasn't ZNN?
that was the squadron C. O. He's here to brief Gibbs.
he didn't say anything about being hung up on before, did he?
don't think that's on his mind right now.
tower, we're experiencing radar altimeter failure.
Happ, we're losing altitude.
I lost the horizon.
I lost the horizon!
pull up, pull up!
last transmission never mentioned a second aircraft.
FAA and local air traffic controllers never reported anything in the area of the crash.
what area is that, Captain?
this is my XO, Lieutenant Commander Hernandez.
he knows the mission and its birds back to front.
the last coordinates indicate the helo went down off the coast of Delaware, sir.
well, how'd they end up in Maryland, Commander?
a RADALT failure could indicate bigger nav system problems.
these are likely false crash coordinates.
would explain why we never found signs of the wreck.
and why you still haven't found my pilot.
we're updating the search area now, but I'm not the one that signed off on a faulty helicopter, Commander.
all right, now, listen.
nobody wants to look bad here.
this is an unavoidable mechanical failure.
we don't know what it is until we ask the crew.
well, until the crew is medically cleared, the only people allowed in are immediate family.
right now, your focus should be on finding that missing wreck and Lieutenant Commander Happ.
it is.
eyewitness testimony could give us flight trajectory, landmarks, any number of factors that...
doctor's orders.
pentagon prefers this crew to be completely recovered and fully lucid.
we don't want any more delusional misinformation.
it's already been four days without any progress.
the media is ready to cry foul.
I'm not the media.
I don't cry foul unless there is one.
the survivors could at least tell us if the pilot survived the crash.
just find him.
and call me when you do.
you're not really gonna wait, are you? - No.
Jethro? Are you here?
Yeah, right here, Duck.
I didn't see you hiding.
I wasn't hiding.
why are you whispering?
Oh, I think it's appropriate, given the clandestine nature of our mission.
I asked you to get medical records, not launch codes.
nice disguise.
Yes, well, I'd like to think that the success of this ruse is not because of a costume, but because of my covert prowess.
thought you called in a favor.
Yeah, well, a cribbage friend is head of oncology.
it's on the floor above, but... that's beside the point.
well, let's get to the point.
Yes. I reviewed their records.
petty Officer Portis remains comatose, but Lieutenant Joplin and Petty Officer Sparks are recovering well.
that, in spite of the fact that they both suffered acute dehydration and exposure.
injuries from the crash?
no evidence of head trauma or anything severe.
I mean, it's... it's a wonder, really.
you believe there's more to this crash than mere mechanical failure.
no, I don't believe anything yet.
Yeah, well, if you're planning to interview the survivors, you're gonna have to get past numerous guards and medical staff.
Yes.
I will use my "covert prowess."
I was going to suggest that you use a master key.
it'll get you into the security wing.
this part of that favor?
no.
so I recommend you hurry.
lieutenant Joplin.
special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.
afternoon, sir.
you heading home?
no, sir.
my C. O. thinks I should rest up another day or two.
told the doctors I was feeling okay, but...
let me help.
if you don't mind me asking, sir, shouldn't NCIS be assisting with search and rescue?
well, we are.
anything you can tell me to help find Commander Happ?
not much chance he's still alive, is there?
how do I justify me coming back instead of him?
I don't have family, sir, but Happ's got a wife and kid.
Yeah, well, that's why I'm asking you, Lieutenant.
what happened?
we were flying low.
tower, we're experiencing radar altimeter failure.
Happ, we're losing altitude.
lost the horizon.
lost the horizon!
pull up, pull up!
everything after is a blur.
next thing I knew, we were bottom up, scrambling for the raft.
it was black out there.
maybe we missed him.
maybe it's our fault he's gone.
you mentioned a second craft when you washed ashore.
I did?
guess I must have been delirious 'cause the only thing we hit was water.
250 RPMs into the Atlantic.
might as well hit concrete.
you got a better chance of winning the lotto than walking away from that.
I can't explain miracles, sir.
just give thanks for 'em.
instead of looking for washed up helicopter parts, we should have Abby looking for evidence of who's turning this ocean into a Dumpster.
this place is disgusting.
quit your eco-whining, Captain Planet.
want to win the bet or not?
well, not this badly.
still think sucking up to Borin is the way to get a date?
really appreciate the help, guys.
Oh, hey, no problem. - Oh, yeah, no, this is great.
really like the new hair.
Thanks.
uh, we're gonna hit the north shore next.
marine debris can get caught in the sewage plant intake.
EW, sewage.
there's got to be an easier way.
why don't you just walk up to her and ask her out?
why not?
I'm sure she'd enjoy a free dinner, even if it is from one of us.
get off my beach.
leave the bags and move along.
take it easy, pal.
we're federal agents.
I'm not impressed.
coast Guard. Drop the knife.
all right, all right, there's been a misunderstanding.
Yeah, you think?
who the hell are you?
name's Shamus Quinn.
I thought these blokes were trying to muscle in on my business.
garbage?
Scrap-- metal and recyclables-- but it's hard to sell it when you're stealing it.
well, I guess it's a cutthroat business, huh?
you gonna give that back, champy?
no, and this scrap is evidence in an ongoing investigation, scruffy.
are we going to have a problem, Mr. Quinn?
of course not, Ma'am.
anything for the Coast Guard.
women of the water are a weakness of mine.
but you are taking my livelihood and my knife.
feel like I should be getting something out of this raw deal.
Yeah, like what?
I don't know, maybe dinner with you.
okay, but from now on, anything you find on that beach gets turned over to the Coast Guard immediately.
but I get it back when you're done.
deal. - Sweet.
guess Agent Borin likes her pork salted.
well, we can't compete with that.
speak for yourself, McInsecurity.
what's that guy have that I don't have?
calluses?
I have emotional calluses.
you want a date with Agent Borin?
no, I mean, I just don't want to let Robert Shaw win.
besides, she's a little too much like Gibbs.
well, that could be a good thing.
Gibbs is independent, loyal, sometimes even caring.
have you told the boss about these feelings?
he can be open-minded.
what?
agent Borin!
it's our missing pilot.
well, if that's a gunshot wound, then he didn't die in the crash.
I still smell like warm sushi.
your little wingman setup is proving to be painful.
well, that was the point.
Yes. No, of course. Thank you.
you know, technically, maybe I should be asking you out.
you did say "the first woman I see."
cute, but you had your chance.
thank you.
joplin and Sparks have been released from the hospital.
good. I got questions.
Yeah, I think the Pentagon was anticipating that.
they've assigned JAG representation.
which is a smart move considering the missing pilot's got a bullet in his brain.
you got info on the victim?
lieutenant Commander Oliver Happ.
four years with Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 24.
otherwise known as the Ghostrunners.
exemplary service record, including two commendations for acts of bravery in Afghanistan.
he's married with a six-year-old son who was recently diagnosed with neurofibro-fib...
neurofibromatosis type two, but you can call it NF2 for short.
can you give us a minute, buddy?
you can go play your game over there by the window.
that's a cool costume.
top Gun?
no, no, he's a helicopter pilot like his father.
I was told you found my husband.
sorry for your loss, ma'am.
thank you.
what happened?
I saw on the news that pilot error hasn't been ruled out.
we haven't ruled anything out yet.
did you recover his flight helmet?
no, Ma'am. No, we haven't. Not yet. - Why?
Oliver-- my... my husband-- he promised Gunner that he could use it for Halloween.
he... he worships his dad.
like the rest of your crew, Commander, you are strangely free of impact trauma, and it appears you miraculously survived the crash.
not as lucky with the bullet.
Ah, well, it entered the frontal lobe, made a mess of things and ended up on the occipital.
luck had nothing to do with it.
no exit.
small caliber.
Yeah, I just sent the slug up to Abby for processing.
time of death?
no, impossible to say.
estimate.
uh, this man's voice was heard on the aircraft's last transmission?
as it went down around midnight.
then I would estimate that he was killed sometime after midnight.
shot at close range?
are you asking me if this man committed suicide?
Yes, I am.
then my answers are going to continue to frustrate.
he was immersed in water, so you can't test for GSR.
his face is eaten by marine life, so you... you can't discern stippling.
while he may have self-destructed, there is absolutely no way for me to prove it.
hell of a way to go.
Yes.
but a slow death adrift at sea, well, suicide may have become, well, a prudent choice.
other Abby, welcome back.
you looking for helicopter parts or having a garage sale?
um, both.
I put together half a ten-speed bike, part of a car engine, two kitchen blenders, all in perfect working order.
I can't believe the things that people throw away.
can't believe you took the time to put it back together.
if there were any helicopter parts, I would have happily built you a helicopter.
right now, I would just settle for some good news.
how about a lead on our shooter?
I ran ballistics on the bullet recovered from our victim.
was this before or after your blender building?
concurrent with.
the bullet removed from the skull is a 22-caliber.
that's not Navy issue.
the only handguns on that helicopter should be standard 9-millimeter.
any of the crew own a spare?
I found one six-inch, ten-round Beretta registered to Petty Officer Josie Sparks.
Gibbs. - Gibbs, it's Borin.
Abby says Borin is on her way up.
I don't understand what the big deal is, Ziva.
it's just a date.
you tell her, McGee.
also, you owe me 40 bucks for those tickets.
they were your idea.
and you're welcome.
now, get in there, Hollywood. Take her breath away.
Iceman's got your back.
why do you get to be Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer?
well, this is going to be priceless.
Hi, Agent Borin.
uh, I wanted to know, do you like '80s cover bands?
because I have tickets.
I mean, uh, Tony got tickets for us, I mean, uh, you know, if you want to go.
um, I just figured that since we were both born around...
you know, that... that you would remember the '80s.
how old are you?
you asking me out, McGee?
well, yeah, well, I've got tickets.
Yeah, no, got that part.
when's the concert, McGee?
uh, next week, boss. This can wait.
get Petty Officer Sparks in here now.
on it! - On it!
I thought you had my back.
nothing I could do. Had to eject.
special Agent Gibbs, this is Lieutenant Nora Patel, JAG Corps.
lieutenant.
I'm not finished.
the Pentagon wanted me to remind both of you that we are all on the same team.
we all want the truth.
of course, sir.
all on the same team, Leon?
could've fooled me.
that's the company line until the higher-ups get one of two things: the truth or someone to blame.
well, I do prefer that the two were related.
Yeah, but I'm not sure they do.
that's a nice tie, Leon. A new look?
it's my wife's idea. It's supposed to help lighten my mood.
yeah?
how's that working out?
my client doesn't know anything about that.
you understand how it looks when you hide behind a lawyer?
lieutenant Sparks has a right to legal counsel.
if for no other reason than to defend against any unfair tactics.
I've heard about you, Agent Gibbs.
bullet that killed your pilot was fired from a 22.
you own one.
unauthorized personal weapons are not permitted on Navy operations.
which is why your client was disciplined for it last month.
you took your 22 on the flight and you used it to shoot Happ.
now, does anything sound unfair so far?
we're leaving.
life's unfair, sir.
tell that to him.
Happ knew better than anyone.
that's the problem.
don't say another word.
no, because I didn't shoot him.
Happ was the one trying to kill us.
I'm listening.
Happ just found out his kid's sick.
no cure.
understandably, he's been upset.
he even got into a fistfight with the squadron commander last week.
but...
but I didn't realize how bad things were until I caught him drinking before a mission briefing.
she didn't report it because Happ didn't fly that day.
I let him sleep it off.
are you saying your pilot was drunk?
no, sir.
we never would've let him fly that night if something was wrong.
he seemed fine.
until we caught him messing with the RADALT system.
he said he couldn't go back.
couldn't face not knowing if his kid was gonna die.
he put us into a dive.
we tried to stop him.
pull up!
pull up!
I pulled my weapon, but never got the chance to fire because we hit the water.
I lost it and never saw Happ again.
why did you lie?
I was trying to protect him.
we all were.
you can understand that, Agent Gibbs.
protecting someone who tried to kill three people?
no.
for his family.
it's enough they lost a husband and a father, but I guess now you're gonna have to tell them the truth.
he was a coward.
did you find out what happened, who shot my husband?
how had your husband been feeling lately?
Oliver was fine.
he looked forward to flying any chance he got.
Wh-What, what is this about?
his reaction to Gunner's diagnosis.
he was devastated.
we all were, but that was weeks ago.
why are you asking? What's wrong?
found, uh... ...a number of these hidden around the house.
credit card shows frequent trips to liquor stores and bars.
has your husband been drinking more lately?
he drinks when he's with friends and-and when he works out in the garage, but it was never to excess, and he would never fly drunk.
no, not drunk-- depressed.
his crew says he tried to commit suicide.
no, no, suicide is impossible.
why is that?
NF2 is a genetic disorder, Agent Gibbs.
it causes tumors to grow randomly throughout the body, and right now, our son has a tumor wrapped around his facial nerve, and when they remove the tumor, the nerve will most likely be destroyed.
Oliver and I had to tell a six-year-old boy that he will probably never smile again.
but Gunner didn't ask any questions, he didn't cry.
no, he's a tough kid.
you know what his main concern was?
that he'd ruin our family pictures.
no one gives up on a kid like that.
especially not his father.
are you saying his crew is lying?
Yes, I am.
I don't care about jurisdiction.
I care about finding that wreck, so just send the water samples to NCIS for testing.
on it, boss.
what exactly are we testing for?
oil and other mechanical fluids can linger after a crash.
if we can find a trace, then we'll get an idea of where to take a closer look.
I see. It's a long shot.
last hope.
just do it, Omagi. - Out.
copy that. Out.
I forget you're a team leader.
Yeah, a lot of good I'm doing.
performance review?
Abby told me.
so, what are you looking to do-- move on up or move on out completely?
maybe, uh, transfer somewhere tropical?
you trying to get rid of me, DiNozzo?
Oh, no, I just... have been there.
looking for a better job title, better money.
so, what are you doing still working for Gibbs?
can't offer me better people.
listen, if you're not busy this weekend, I actually was thinking...
Oh, crap.
Oh, Crawfish Casanova, huh?
Yeah, relax. I'm not going on a date with him.
I only said I was because I knew what you and McGee were up to.
Ziva told me everything.
of course she did.
so that means the bet's off.
Yeah, and it sounds to me like you have better people to ask.
wait. Where's my stuff?
we've grounded all rotary wing squadrons until each and every bird is mechanically inspected for flaws.
so far, it appears to be an isolated incident.
and if the crash was human error?
I told you, Happ wasn't depressed.
your crew is trained to compartmentalize emotions, correct?
they've also been trained to recognize and speak up about operational risk management factors
lack of sleep, domestic problems.
suicidal tendencies.
I know my people.
a lot of people under your command, Captain.
Happ's been a friend longer than a subordinate.
I'm the first guy he told when they were pregnant with Gunner.
I'm the first guy he came to for support when he was diagnosed.
now, if there was something wrong, I would know.
so you knew about the fight Happ started with Lieutenant Commander Hernandez?
what fight?
sir. - Get your butt over here.
what are they talking about?
petty Officer Sparks mentioned it.
pilots get competitive, Ma'am.
my training times were better, and he accused me of cheating.
nothing bruised but egos, so I let it slide.
lot of that going around lately.
I trust my crew, Agent Gibbs.
if they never said anything to me, there was nothing to worry about.
two of them are saying something now, Captain.
that you let a man with emotional issues fly that night.
so who's lying, Captain, you or your crew?
you can stare all you want, but a watched Mass Spec will not boil.
he's also immune to wishing, hoping, willing, most forms of voodoo.
like I said, most forms.
what do you got, Abbs?
salt water.
there's no significant sources of any mechanical pollutants in your water samples.
sorry, this is just not your week.
hasn't been great for the Happ family, either.
and it's about to get worse.
how?
pentagon is ready to issue a statement blaming the crash on Happ's suicide attempt.
but the investigation is still ongoing.
we told them that, but the longer they wait, the more it looks like they're hiding the truth.
Yeah, but we don't know the truth, do we?
lab. This is Abby.
does Gibbs know about this?
he and Ziva are headed back from the Seahawk.
McGee: Guy's wife and son are about to be bombarded by media, and all we have is hearsay and a couple of bourbon bottles.
and the eyewitness testimony of two decorated crewmates.
their stories match.
well, who's to say what's the truth, right?
those guys spent four days together in a raft.
am I missing something?
you mean besides a helicopter?
or a single straight answer?
need more than a gut feeling.
how about a third opinion?
that was the hospital.
petty Officer Portis is awake.
game on, McGee. Let's go.
what about Gibbs?
we'll call on the way.
doctors suspect brain damage due to the dehydration.
they're not even sure he can understand them.
then I guess we'd better ask the right questions.
petty Officer Portis, we're with NCIS.
we're investigating the crash.
your crewmates, Joplin and Sparks, have each given full accounts.
we're hoping you might be able to help us confirm what happened that night.
did Lieutenant Commander Happ try to commit suicide?
is that what caused the crash?
release my clients, Agent Gibbs.
pentagon press briefing is in two hours, and you have no evidence to refute their testimony.
petty Officer Portis said enough.
except that he never actually said anything, and doctors are saying partial brain damage.
it's gonna take a lot more than a hazy nod to keep this case open.
she's right, Gibbs.
I'll let you know when we find it.
we have been running deep background on the entire squadron, and found a connection.
four of them applied for apostille stamps in the last month.
a form of federal notary for document verification.
so what?
well, they're rare, and usually only needed to open offshore bank accounts.
you have proof that's what it was for?
no, but that's not what got our attention.
call the ball, probie.
of the crew on that helo, Happ was the only one that never applied for a stamp.
I thought you said there were four.
there were-- the fourth was Squadron Commander Hernandez.
if the crew was into something together, then what's his connection?
well, the final mission report was just published, and it includes personnel rosters.
we knew who was on that helicopter.
but we didn't know who was supposed to be.
while Commander Happ was on duty that night, he wasn't originally scheduled to fly.
Hernandez was.
go.
we don't know what any of this means, Director.
let you know when we find it.
looks like your ego is writing checks your offshore bank account can't cash, Commander.
what did you know that kept you from wanting to fly that night?
nothing.
I was sick.
I went to see my girlfriend, and she made me chicken soup.
that's funny-- she said you went out to dinner and that you weren't sick.
time to change course, flyboy.
before you find yourself crash-landing in the middle of a court-martial.
that's good one.
you can wear the sunglasses for a little bit.
that account wasn't for your military pension, was it?
joplin and Sparks planned it.
nobody was supposed to find out.
find out about what?
that we were gonna sell the helo.
sell it to who?
I don't know.
joplin said he found a buyer and everything was set for that night, but I...
couldn't go through with it and I called in sick.
who killed Lieutenant Commander Happ?
I don't know. I swear.
joplin and Sparks, they saved my ass in Afghanistan last year, and I owe them my life.
they can't know that I said anything.
all right?
that's a negative, Ghostrunner.
the pattern's full.
we didn't kill Happ.
we're not murderers, sir.
prove it.
excuse me, Petty Officer.
you can't split them up.
I need to advise both my clients.
not if they tell me the truth.
lieutenant.
sir...
how much does a Seahawk go for these days, Lieutenant?
three hundred thousand.
split four ways.
but only if it works, right?
I guess if the Coast Guard can't find it... - Maybe it was not lost in the first place.
there was no crash.
we faked it.
tower, we're experiencing radar altimeter failure!
Happ, we're losing altitude!
I lost the horizon! I lost the horizon!
pull up! Pull up!
comms are cut!
they can't hear us!
we flew south and landed on a ship waiting to meet us.
we'd get our money, set off in the raft and wait for rescue teams.
30-year-old helo being phased out of service, nobody would miss it.
we all agreed to the plan.
until Hernandez backed out.
everything else was in place, so we took a chance and told Happ once we were in the air.
you knew he could use the money for his son, and against three armed crew members, he would not have much choice.
you threatened him.
No!
he went along with it on his own.
or so we thought.
but once we landed, Happ pulled his weapon on us.
we're not doing this!
I want your weapons on the deck now!
and your 22, Sparks!
come on, Happ, don't blow this.
the plan is gonna work!
said he wasn't gonna lie to his country or his family like that.
no, he stood up to all three of you.
so you shot him?
no. It was the boat captain.
we should've stopped it there, called off the deal.
but you took the money in offshore accounts.
the captain was supposed to drop us near where we faked the crash.
but the murder changed things?
he disabled the transponders in the raft and just dumped us.
we were nowhere near the search grid.
we deserved it.
I need a name, Lieutenant.
the buyer was Shamus Quinn.
met him at the marina where I keep my boat.
in Virginia Beach.
call Borin.
have her lock it down.
got an update?
Yeah. This warehouse is the only address listed under Quinn's name.
are you sure he's in here?
Yeah. We got movement in the back office, and no one's been in or out since you called.
let's move.
spread out.
Ziva, stairs.
get off me!
come here!
get off me!
settle down, Hemingway.
you got him? - Yeah.
same model as Sparks' gun.
it's got to be the murder weapon.
here we go.
nice job, McMan.
since we found the missing helo on Quinn's boat, my review is looking pretty good, so how about a drink on me as professionals?
Oh, have to take a rain check.
you know, we kind of have plans already.
friday night.
hot dates, huh?
Yes! Playing video games.
you never went to the bar.
you stayed home playing with yourselves.
I mean... with each other.
I mean... McGee, I read your e-mails.
you broke in to my computer?
how do you know my password?
boss, she's not allowed to do that.
truth will out, DiNozzo.
right. Let's hear it.
well, we had every intention of going out, and when I went by McGeek's place, he... he was still... enthralled by this-this first-person shooter game.
it was pretty cool, actually.
that would explain your newfound combat tactics.
look, don't blame me, Tony.
you were the one that wanted to stay once I found that sorority sister "capture the flag" battalion.
Oh, they-they were hot.
they sounded hot.
drink?
Yes.
thank you.
finally, someone has the decency to ask me to join them.
that's what this was about?
she set us up because we didn't ask her out in the first place.
how did we miss that?
the better question is: How are you gonna fix it?
hold that door!
I'm in. I'm in.
family honors hero
game on.
No! No! No!
No...!
don't!
captain!
Ah, the sweet smell of recycled air.
the hot glare of an annoying skylight.
the weird whir of broken fax machine.
another day in paradise.
well, somebody woke up on the far side of the bed.
actually, I sort of did, Ziva.
thanks to my annoying new neighbors who kept me awake until 5: 00 this morning.
the screamers? - The screamers.
third night in a row.
I had neighbors once who never stopped fighting.
not that kind of screamer, Ziva.
I don't know what happened, but I must have taken your bag last night when I left.
do you have mine? - Yeah.
thank you.
Hey, you didn't snoop, did you?
no, I didn't snoop.
that's your department.
my 1974 Instamatic.
you're taking up photography?
no. No, but I loved it when I was a kid.
I took this camera with me everywhere.
and I found it in this box that my dad gave me a while back.
I'm hoping Abby can develop whatever's on this film.
you do not know?
no. - Well, if it's anything like your boarding school picture...
what boarding school picture?
you did snoop, you little liar.
give it to me.
I don't know. I really think Ziva should see it first.
okay. Okay.
okay. Have your chuckles.
by the way, that was a very good look back in the day.
for a Bible salesman.
Tony, if I were you, I would burn that film because you do not want any more of these getting out there.
it shouldn't have gotten out at all, but it did thanks to McSnoop Dogg here.
now, listen, give me the picture...
...because Gibbs cannot get his hands on this.
do you understand me?
nice look, helmet head.
Hey, boss.
it was a transitional phase.
you know, the eighties.
sort of had a John Denver thing going on, and, uh.
let's go.
dead Marine downtown.
uh, boss, can I have that back, please?
see what you did?! Can I have that back, please?
watch and wallet are still here.
no signs of a robbery.
got an I. D?
Yeah. First Lieutenant Michael Torres, 31.
originally from Ohio.
moved to D. C. after getting engaged last year.
family?
parents have been notified.
fiancée's out of town on a trip.
get her back.
any weapon, Duck?
uh, wounds are consistent with the good old-fashioned human fist.
Yeah, believe it or not, at one point in my life, I dabbled in boxing.
well, I wasn't really a boxer, per se.
uh, more of a, uh, an assistant.
uh... Uh... I was a bucket boy.
give me a T. O.D.Duck.
judging by the lack of rigor and the coagulation, oh, approximately 2: 00 to 3: 00 a. m.
Oh, that is a nasty gash to the back of his head.
deep laceration.
doctor, there's something under his fingernails here.
looks like dirt.
I have located just one security camera.
belongs to the owner of the building.
the camera face the alley?
he believes so, but I will verify.
Hey, boss. Cops just got a call about someone breaking into the victim's apartment.
witnesses described a young white male with blood on his clothes.
NCIS. Turn around. Now!
captain Joe Westcott, Sir. Don't shoot. Don't shoot!
you're coming with us, Captain.
no, I can't. Can't.
those men-- they took Lieutenant Torres, and I have to get him back.
no one has him.
he's dead.
guy seemed pretty out of it, boss.
maybe he's still in shock. - Or guilty.
background.
by all accounts, Captain Joseph Westcott and Lieutenant Michael Torres were close.
friends since childhood, joined the Corps together.
records are spotless. Both highly regarded by their unit.
C. O. called them born leaders.
says they exemplify the highest level of commitment to the Marines.
captain never called 911.
doesn't sound like commitment to me.
what else?
lieutenant Torres was finishing his second tour in Afghanistan.
and, uh, Captain Westcott his third before his release for medical discharge eight months ago.
and yet he still uses the title.
that's habit. - He lives in Ohio. Currently unemployed.
father is alive, mother is deceased.
one brother.
he's a Marine.
what type of injury?
nerve damage to his right leg after an ambush on his unit last year near Arghanda.
still gathering details, but we do know that four Marines were killed.
with Lieutenant Torres... that makes five.
so, what were you were doing in Lieutenant Torres' apartment?
gathering supplies, sir.
I had to find him.
you saying he was taken from the alley?
cause that's where he was found.
they must've dumped him back there.
they?
there were five or six attackers.
they came out of nowhere, sir. Out of nowhere.
special Agent Gibbs.
sorry. It's habit.
Where'd you get these?
everything was just happening so fast.
we were running, it was dark, and I kept yelling for Torres to stay with me.
stay with me.
don't... let them gain on us. And then, I...
I lost him.
let's start from the beginning, all right?
where were you?
last night... when this happened.
we finished dinner at this Italian place, and we headed over to a convenience store to get something to drink.
and when we walked out, I felt these guys right on our tail.
okay. - What time was that?
around 0200.
okay. Then what?
well, then, next thing I know, we're getting pounded.
and I got hit hard.
when I came to, I saw Torres being dragged away, and he was in bad shape.
and I just... I wanted to help him.
I ran.
uh... Did you get a good look at the attackers?
uh... one.
and I keep seeing his face over and over in my head.
okay.
I'll bring someone in to do a sketch.
you can give details, right?
right? Captain?
do my best, sir.
you serve, Agent Gibbs?
scout sniper.
then you know what it's like.
seeing your friends die, and thinking you could've done more.
he's haunted by what he saw.
I'm not at all surprised.
lieutenant Torres suffered quite an attack before his death.
Mr. Palmer?
we counted ten wounds.
four in the arms and torso, three in the face, three to the back.
in other words, he was getting punched from all directions.
multiple attackers.
well, it would appear so.
and yet, we didn't find any offensive wounds.
his knuckles are clear of bruising, and his hands have no fractures.
nothing to suggest that he fought back.
that's weird for a seasoned combat vet.
cause of death? - Blunt force trauma.
the impact almost split his skull open.
Oh, and there was a small amount of gravel in the wound.
that's his head hitting concrete.
we didn't find any fingerprints?
and no word from Abby yet on the substance under his fingernails.
Yes, but I sent her samples of blood from each of his wounds.
these are her results.
they all match the Lieutenant's except one.
doesn't match Westcott, either.
Yeah, well, it means one thing.
find someone with a DNA match, and you have your killer.
McGee, give me something.
well, credit card records show that Lieutenant Torres made purchases at Brusquelli's Restaurant at 12: 45 a. m. then at Atlantic E-Z Mart at 2: 03.
right before his murder.
video? - Store security cameras were down for repair.
Tony and Ziva talked to the manager.
they're on their way back.
got footage from the alley?
hasn't been easy.
it's off an old VHS tape.
trying to work with this stuff is like trying to ride a dinosaur on the freeway.
not your concern. I'll put it up.
what am I looking at?
those shadows you see may be duplicates, or ghost images.
it's what happens when the same tape gets recorded over without being erased.
Meaning?
meaning, some of the people you see were there last night, some maybe... six months ago.
even worse, alley's right next to a train station.
gets a ton of foot traffic.
GIBBS: Any of these Lieutenant Torres?
well, after matching the time code on the tape to the time of the murder,
I was able to isolate what I believe is him.
there. Right next to him.
looks like Captain Westcott's height and build.
keep going.
I. D. the attackers.
we already did.
name is Sam Mathis.
put it up.
manager reported he was at the store last night hassling customers.
said he was looking to start a fight.
guy's got a record, boss.
assault charges dating back to 2000.
Hey, you recognize him?
maybe, not sure, uh, but this guy-- he was there, no doubt.
Ziva, start a BOLO on this.
DiNozzo, you find Mathis.
McGee... - I'll keep working the video.
get Abby to help.
you are still a witness in this case.
stay close for a few days.
I'm here to help, Agent Gibbs. I just want to find whoever did this.
I don't understand how this could happen, Agent Gibbs.
michael was home.
home's supposed to be safe.
your fiancé have any enemies, anybody that'd want to hurt him?
no.
the only enemies he worried about were the ones in Afghanistan.
When'd you last talk?
last night, uh, um, 9:30.
did he seem upset or did he seem agitated?
no, no, he was fine, excited that the General was in town visiting.
who is, uh, the General?
that's what all the guys in the unit called Joe Westcott.
they worshipped him.
he was their rock.
and lately, um, he had Michael worried.
Why?
after he was discharged, he kind of withdrew.
michael thought that he was too isolated in Ohio.
kept telling him to come visit.
that's the only thing giving me comfort right now...
just knowing that Joe was with Michael when he died.
no need to explain, Tony.
everyone goes through a, an awkward stage.
granted, it may have been a little awkward, but take a look at me now-- not very awkward.
well, I think, underneath that nice suit and that charming smile, you are still a very homely little boy.
homely little boy?
I was an adorable little boy and when I get those pictures developed, your world will be rocked, Ms. David.
well, I'm looking forward to it.
nci who?
you need to come with us.
how's that for homely?
Yeah, it's a real laugh riot, huh?
well, keep it up, smart-ass, and I'll put you right back in cuffs.
would you like that?
it's all fun and games until somebody gets hurt or, in Lieutenant Torres' case, killed.
why don't we take a look at what you did?
I told you I don't know nothing about no murder.
no, of course not, and I bet those cuts got there all by themselves.
it's not what it looks like, man.
Hey, I've got an idea.
let's look at your record.
I've done some stuff.
so what?
that don't make me no killer.
we know you were in the Atlantic E-Z Mart last night looking for a fight.
I was just messing around.
messing around?
well, let's see, if, by "messing around," you mean, uh, getting up in people's faces, then, I guess you are correct.
did you get up in Lieutenant Torres' face?
maybe, I don't know.
I think you did and I think you followed him out of the store, down the street, and I think you jumped him.
okay. Yeah, I left right after that guy and his friend, but I didn't follow them.
had someplace else to be.
Really? Hot date?
I don't want to say, all right?
my old lady would kill me if she knew.
where do you think I got these from?
you don't have an alibi, so the next time you see your old lady, it's going to be in court.
I was at High Points, okay?
I was at High Points all night.
the strip club over on Third? - Yeah.
you know the place?
okay. Great, Misty, all right, all right, all right.
Yes. That is all I need to know.
I can't thank you enough.
you have always been so helpful, and I mean that in the most professional way.
no, I'm not going to play "Misty" for you.
all right. I got to run. Yeah, take care of yourself, bye.
get your mind out of the gutter, David.
I'm a professional and Misty is a very nice girl.
I am sure she is.
give me the latest.
club owner confirmed Mathis arrived at 2: 00 a. m.left just after 6: 00.
faxing over receipts now.
and Abby ran a test on his blood.
it does not match the sample we found.
not our killer.
bolo. - Nothing yet.
local and state authorities are still on alert.
go back over Lieutenant Torres' record, interview marines he served with.
what about Captain Westcott?
Yeah, what about him?
shouldn't we talk to him again, see if he's forgetting something?
no, he's given us enough.
what, DiNozzo?
well, he was the last one to see Lieutenant Torres alive and he had bruises all over his hands.
Ducky never found any physical evidence tying him to the murder.
I still think that warrants a second look.
and I don't.
special Agent David. I will let him know.
Gibbs, there is a visitor downstairs for Captain Westcott.
who?
agent Gibbs. - Sergeant Westcott.
good to meet you.
your brother know you're here?
I hope so, sir, he called me.
said you were on a seven-month tour, not back till Christmas.
no, sir, on leave till Christmas.
he must have got them mixed up.
understandable, considering.
your father coming, too?
uh, no, no.
soon, though, he just had to take care of a few work things back home.
probably for the best.
why is that?
where can I find my brother, sir?
he's at the Adler Hotel downtown.
can take you if you'll wait a minute.
you know, I'd rather not.
I'd like to see him as soon as I can.
okay, understood.
family first. - Always, sir.
Gibbs, Gibbs, don't go, don't go that way.
no, don't go that way.
Abbs, where?
this way, this way.
try spending the day with her.
Oh, you love it and you know it.
so, based on the evidence from the scene,
I was able to recreate all the blows to Lieutenant Torres' body.
there were ten blows in total to the arms, torso, back, and face.
so it looks like he was surrounded, right?
but, look, if he had been surrounded, each wound would have a distinct impression because each attacker would have been standing in a totally different place and striking from a totally different angle.
now, based on my measurements,
I only found two types of impressions-- striking from the front and the back.
two attackers.
McGee, you find anything from the video?
McGee: No, I'm working on it, but still no faces.
this tape is, like, a million years old.
it's giving me all kinds of problems.
it's like riding a... - Dinosaur. Freeway. Got it.
Yeah. - Yeah, but faces or no faces, Gibbs, our findings do not match up with Captain Westcott's story.
I mean, there's no way there were multiple attackers.
think he's lying?
time to find out.
he won't open the door, Agent Gibbs.
he say anything?
uh, he told me to go back to Ohio, he doesn't need anyone, he's fine.
it's just like him, you know, taking everything on himself.
captain Westcott. Special Agent Gibbs. Open the door.
well, hey, look who's here.
Oh, five minutes ago you wouldn't answer the door, now you're the funny guy.
let's talk, Captain.
well, I'm kind of in the middle of something right now, Agent Gibbs, can it wait?
no, no, it can't wait.
no. He's coming, too.
what, you smoking now, Joe? - Yeah.
why are you even here anyway? - You called me, remember?
Yeah, I remember.
I'm just messing with you, little brother, just messing with you.
that mean something, Captain?
you know, I've been brainstorming all day about everything that happened, and I think if we went back to the convenience store and we did a little...
we found some inconsistencies. - Yeah?
okay, well, let's talk it out, let's talk it out.
maybe I can help you piece some things together and...
I meant with your story.
what are you saying, Agent Gibbs?
evidence says two attackers.
no, that's wrong, all right, I told you that there were five or six.
Yeah, I'm telling you that's not possible.
think I'm lying?
like I don't know what I saw?
I'm not crazy.
I didn't say that.
a man's dead and I'll find the truth.
Yeah, what, and I don't want to?
talking about my best friend here, Agent Gibbs.
Hey, wait a minute, take it easy. - Nobody wants to find the truth more than me.
Joe, come on, that's not what... - Shut up, Evan, you stay out of it.
now, I know what I saw.
we were attacked and my friends are dead.
your friends?
you should be out there looking for the killers... - I got a job to do.
...instead of standing here questioning me! You got a job to do?!
well, do it somewhere else!
Joe. - Get out!
Joe, what the hell are you doing?
get out now. Now!
I know what I saw! I know what I saw.
Joe's never lost it like that.
he never even raises his voice.
I need to go back. Try and reason with him.
he won't listen.
not now. Just give him time.
he's not going anywhere.
with all due respect, I think I know him a little better than you do.
he's confused.
you saw that, right?
he's in pain. His best friend is dead.
this isn't just about Lieutenant Torres.
there's something else going on.
all right, I know what you're thinking, but you're wrong.
my brother's fine, Agent Gibbs.
he's fine.
looking for answers?
cause I can assure you Lieutenant Torres stopped talking a long time ago.
so has Captain Westcott.
I take it your conversation did not go well.
he's in trouble, Duck.
he's struggling with the truth.
and you think you're the one to help him find it?
I don't know.
maybe.
Oscar Wilde said,"Man is least himself when he talks in his own person."
but give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth
I suspect that you know all too well the mask that the captain is wearing.
not about me. - No, it's not.
but perhaps your own past struggles can help you to unlock what the captain is hiding.
he's shut down, Duck.
so is his brother.
well, denial is a very powerful thing.
well, then we got to break through.
it's the only way we're gonna find the lieutenant's killer.
he, uh, seemed obsessed with this.
any idea what it means?
might have something to do with an ambush last year.
he keeps talking about friends he lost.
well, it's not unusual for one trauma to evoke strong memories of another.
well, that's what I'm worried about.
well, worry tomorrow.
it's late, Jethro.
go home. Get some sleep.
I'll see you in the morning.
Hey, Boss.
early bird gets the worm?
figure this out?
actually, you know, I got a text once from an ex-girlfriend that said...
DiNozzo. - Sorry.
what do you think?
looks like an acronym. Or a name.
it means something to Captain Westcott.
find out why.
we're giving him a second look, after all?
we are covering all bases.
starting now.
you have any other questions?
Nope. I'm good.
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
Yeah, Abbs. I'm on my way.
revisit the Arghanda ambush.
dig deeper.
we are still awaiting the official military report.
talk to State. DoD. I want answers. Everything. Now.
correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't he... - Yeah.
he's still wearing the same clothing he was wearing yesterday.
noticed that, too.
I think he's getting too close to this case.
too close to Westcott, for sure.
Gibbs only gets too close when he sees something we do not.
wonder what he's seeing this time.
Oh, good, there you are.
things are getting much clearer.
we finally ID'd the attacker's face. - "Face"?
you said there were two.
Gibbs, that was so yesterday.
after a very long night, and more Caf-POW!s
than the recommended daily allowance, we were able to isolate the last moments before Lieutenant Torres' murder.
by stripping down and reassembling the tape,
I was able to get a much clearer picture of just who was in the alley and who wasn't.
go closer.
that's the same guy in Westcott's sketch.
right down to the beady little eyes.
I got a hit on facial recognition, and then McGee found him in the state police database.
Randall Kersey, 25 years old.
cited for jaywalking last month.
he works for Bilson Phone Company here in DC.
what's his connection to Torres?
McGee: None that I can find.
no military background either, but I did find something else.
they followed him, Boss.
there's more.
so, you know those mystery particles we found underneath Lieutenant Torres' fingernails?
it wasn't dirt.
they're tiny pieces of mammalian flesh.
and not the human kind.
it's bovine.
like a cow. Or a... buffalo.
or... Who knows?
the important thing is it tested positive for the lipase enzyme that's used to process leather.
on Captain Westcott's jacket.
if Lieutenant Torres had that much under his nails, he must've really been holding on to the captain.
or holding him back.
I was afraid for my life.
you're sure these are the two men who came after you?
Yeah, him. Not the other one.
Well,"the other one" has a name.
that's Lieutenant Torres.
and he's dead.
it was an accident.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
what happened?
they followed me out of a convenience store on Third.
and... this guy here.
he... was yelling.
h-he was saying stuff that didn't even make any sense.
I tried to get away, and he chased me down.
and then I asked him what he wanted, and then... he just lost it.
he just started throwing punches.
you punched back.
I mean, the guy was out of his mind, okay?
Yeah.
where was Lieutenant Torres?
he was... holding on to him.
he was trying to get him to stop.
and then he got in-between us, a-and the t... the tall guy...
captain Westcott. - Yeah.
he just kept swinging, so I did, too.
and his friend, h-he was still in-between us, so he was getting hit a bunch of times.
I mean, i-it was... it was total chaos.
and then finally I-I pushed as hard as I could to get away...
...and then that's...
that's when Lieutenant Torres went down.
Yeah, he was... he was just lying there on the ground.
and he must've hit his head or something 'cause there was blood everywhere.
did you go for help?
no. I panicked, okay?
I just wanted to get out of there.
I wanted to go somewhere safe.
you could be brought up on involuntary manslaughter.
no. No, no, no. No way. I'm gonna get a lawyer.
I know this is self-defense.
this guy here. He was crazy.
okay, Agent Gibbs?
he came after me.
I still cannot reach him.
what about his brother?
he has not seen or spoken to Captain Westcott since last night.
not returning any of his calls, either.
hotel? - Front desk said he left early this morning.
belongings are still in his room.
Gibbs, you don't think he would do anything crazy... - McGee. Phone.
pulling up the cell grid now.
no hits.
either he's got his cell phone turned off or he's left the area.
I don't think so.
metro P. D. just spotted a guy matching Captain Westcott's description.
where?
third and Rose, downtown.
that is right near the spot of Lieutenant Torres' death.
you guys stay here. I got DiNozzo. Let's move.
captain Westcott. Special Agent Gibbs. Put down the knife.
general, put down your weapon!
your men need you.
you're not alone.
turn it off. Turn it... - This is hard.
I feel like I'm going crazy.
you're not. - How do you know that?
because... I had my own head scrambled once a long time ago.
I'm telling you something happened to me that night, Agent Gibbs.
I don't... I got confused.
like I was someplace else.
you back at the ambush?
it's okay.
it's okay to talk about it.
it's okay to talk about... Marines you lost.
they were damn good men.
all of them.
but they never had a chance,'cause the enemy came out of nowhere.
and I was convinced... I was convinced that that guy on the tape was there.
fighting with the other side.
Randall Kersey lives in Virginia.
his passport says he's never been to Afghanistan.
then why did I follow him?
your mind plays tricks on you when you're in pain.
when I saw him in the store that night, I don't know, I didn't...
know what was real and what wasn't.
I lost control.
I felt like I had to fight for my life, for Torres' life.
move! Move! Move!
I was back in Arghanda all over again.
move! Move! Move!
get down!
fall back! Fall back! Fall back!
captain! Captain! Captain...!
I thought I saw Torres being dragged away in the alley that night, but it was really PFC Hall in Arghanda.
captain!
then I got scared.
then I ran.
one of my men went in and grabbed Hall, brought him back to the unit.
but he didn't make it.
you see, I couldn't save Hall, I couldn't save Torres
I... I'm just a big damn coward.
no, you're not a coward. You're human.
I don't know how to do this.
I don't, and I'm supposed to be the one everybody leans on,"The General."
you'll get back there, I promise.
but what if I can't?
what if I'm stuck like this?
you won't be.
face the fear.
captain Westcott, I'm Lieutenant Commander Peter Sanger from Portsmouth Naval Hospital.
you can feel free to call me Dr. Pete.
most people do.
now, first I just want to commend you for reaching out to Agent Gibbs.
the hardest part is asking for help.
post-traumatic stress is a complicated disorder affecting many of our military's finest.
it feels like I'm the only one.
well, you're not. Trust me.
now, besides these, um, recurring flashbacks, are you experiencing any nightmares or insomnia, anger, irritability, panic attacks?
Yes, sir.
and which ones, Captain?
all of them, sir.
for how long?
it started right after I got back, so about eight months ago.
and this is the first time you're sharing this with your brother?
um... it's nobody else's problem.
you do need to remember that you're not a burden, Captain.
I'm sorry.
don't be-- it is what it is.
EVAN: No, Joe, I... I'm sorry.
I mean, I knew you weren't right, but I didn't want to face it.
I just want you to be okay.
I know, little brother. Me, too.
I thought you, uh, you had to work, sir.
I took some time off.
your brother said I needed to be here.
what's going on, son?
have a seat, Mr. Westcott.
doc will fill you in.
doctor?
are you sick?
dad... sit down, please.
there you are.
are you looking at more homely pictures?
are you all right, Tony?
can I show you something?
Yes.
is this your mother?
Yes.
wow, she was... she was beautiful.
I... I guess she was.
how come you never talk about her?
I don't?
no.
no, you don't.
well, I guess, uh... ...she was the first woman to break my heart, and I don't like to talk about things like that.
you don't like to talk about it because you don't want to.
maybe it causes you too much pain.
so she was the one that took you to the movies, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, we would go to these, uh, dollar matinees, make these weekend trips into the city, and...
there was this theater that she loved over on 42nd Street.
it was pretty rundown, but... she loved movies.
you know, and, uh...
I think she loved the escape.
this was the last movie we ever saw together.
right before she...
the Little Prince.
that which is essential is invisible to the eye
Ziva David, did you just quote a movie? - No.
I quoted a book... that was made into a movie.
well, not so good with the emotions, my old man.
well, you can't worry about your father right now, Captain.
you have to take care of yourself.
but if you need anything else, day or night, you just give me a call, okay?
I'm here. - Will do.
no more messing around, huh?
I guess the real work starts now?
Yep.
looks like it.
Hey, listen, if I have to lie back on a couch and talk about the pet bunny that I lost when I was three, I'm coming after you, Agent Gibbs.
Yeah, okay. I got it.- Big-time.
you're a good man.
Oorah, Agent Gibbs. - Oorah.
general.
well, as fun as that all-dog talent show sounds,
I've still got some stuff to finish up here, Abby.
meet you for dinner later? - Yep.
okay. Bye.
what have we here?
Ziva, what were those three initials that Gibbs was talking about?
why do you ask?
Marines' After-Action Report of the Arghanda Ambush just came through.
they I. D.'d the group responsible.
the Ijil Rebels.
so maybe Captain Westcott really was trying to remember something.
Yeah. Or someone.
background. Go.
well, it looks like State just added them to their watch list.
they're young, growing fast, strong ties to Hamas and Hezbollah.
McGee, location.
last known headquarters were in the Kanjal Province.
that is less than five miles from Arghanda.
close enough to keep an eye on Westcott's unit.
close enough to launch a surprise nighttime attack. Surveillance.
CIA sent in a drone to monitor activities.
looks like there may be some photos on file.
get tighter.
boss, isn't that...?
Randall Kersay really was fighting with the enemy.
okay, boss, he's in Rosslyn, Virginia, just off the I-66.
let's go.
clear! - Clear!
either he never actually lived here, or he knew how to clean up well.
Hey, boss, you might want to come out and look at this.
what is that?
it's a building blueprint.
looks like our wannabe John Walker Lindh was planning something.
something big.
not was.
is.
find him.
they took Lieutenant Torres, and I have to get him back.
he's dead.
where can I find my brother, sir? - You shut up, Evan!
Randall Kersey. They followed him, boss.
I pushed as hard as I could to get away, and...
that's when Lieutenant Torres went down?
I know what I saw!
post-traumatic stress is a complicated disorder.
something happened to me that night, Agent Gibbs.
Torres was never dragged away, it was one of my men in the ambush.
I was back in Arghanda all over again.
and I was convinced that that guy on the tape was there.
McGee: I. J.I. It means something to Captain Westcott.
find out why.
after-action Report of the Arghanda ambush
ID'd the group responsible, the Ijil Rebels.
Randall Kersey really was fighting with the enemy.
what is that? - A building blueprint.
looks like our John Walker Lindh was planning something.
not was. Is.
find him.
Oh, no! See that, McCartney?
Aw, you losing to yourself again?
no, man. She's looking at me.
Yeah. With her sexy little robe, and her big ol' bedroom eyes.
Oh, yeah.
this girl wants me bad.
are we going on patrol tonight, Captain Westcott?
well, if Hall can tear himself away from his new girlfriend.
sir, she's got nothing on my Sara.
before I left, her belly was out to here, but my Sara was still...
the prettiest girl in the Sunshine State.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
my baby girl wants to be a ballerina?
daddy's gonna buy her a tutu.
she wants to play football?
daddy's gonna teach her how to throw a spiral.
move! Move! Move! Move!
captain!
daddy.
looks good on me, huh, Captain?
captain! Captain!
captain Westcott?
sir?
you were right about Kersey being in Arghanda.
with the enemy?
Yeah, he's planning something here.
gone off-grid.
we need your help to go find him.
sorry, Agent Gibbs, but I don't think I have anything else for you.
you had contact with Kersey here and in Afghanistan.
any detail could give us something.
he talk to anyone at the convenience store?
no. But it didn't seem like he was there for a pack of gum, either.
I tried to track everything he was doing, but... it was too much.
the After-Action Report says that you and Torres were inside enemy headquarters during the ambush.
honestly, sir, I only put that in there because Torres said we were inside.
I don't...
I only remember the ambush in pieces, and that's not one of them.
anyone else file a report?
no, I was the C. O. Far as Kersey, uh... I clocked him deep into the ambush.
he was attempting to capture PFC Hall.
but I didn't see anything else.
any of your other men see him?
there was only one other man in the area: McCartney.
uh, I'm sorry.
his-his real name is Paul Patterson.
moved back home after he got out.
virginia, I think.
this kid, superhuman.
okay, Captain, you up for taking a little trip tomorrow?
maybe the two of you can put your heads together.
he'll do whatever you need, Agent Gibbs.
no doubt, sir.
look, I know you need to get well.
and I won't keep you any longer than I have to.
it is a little cramped in here.
be glad to get you guys another room if it'll help.
you feel like you need watching, son?
no, sir.
but if you want to stay...
Oh, no. I need to get back to Ohio.
come on, a few more days won't hurt.
what? - You heard what he said; he said he's okay.
got it.
no, I need to get back to work.
this time of year is brutal.
I'd like someone here.
I'll stay.
what do you mean it's sold out?
no, no.
it has to be Saturday night.
Yes, it has to be the opera.
okay, do not tell me that I'm out of luck, because I think it's...
fine.
big three of romantic dates: beach picnic, impromptu dancing in the rain and the opera.
so who is he?
he is no one.
you're serious about this guy?
I'm serious about my guy. Where's Kersey?
uh, current location still unknown.
bolo went out wide.
neighbors last saw him driving a blue sedan.
still looking for the plate numbers, but there's nothing with wheels registered to his name.
background?
Randall J. Kersey. 25 years old. Born in the City of Angels.
he started a degree in Philosophy at the University of Maine, but a semester abroad in India sent him in another direction.
Yeah, the terrorist direction.
hooked up with the Ijil Rebels somewhere along the border, then he followed the pied piper across Pakistan, into Afghanistan.
CIA only knew him by his Muslim name: Sulayman al-Janfi.
they did not connect that name to Kersey.
contacts?
no living relatives, but he does list a girlfriend by the name of Brooke Fenten as an emergency contact.
you were right, boss.
Abby confirmed that the paper found in Kersey's basement was part of a building blueprint.
does she know which building?
not yet.
but she did say the explosive remnants suggest that Kersey likely has two IEDs.
probably small in size, but they'll pack a big punch.
must be quite the building he's got his heart set on.
talk to the girlfriend.
girlfriend experience coming up.
more than happy to wait here, sir.
so, where'd the nickname come from?
as in Paul.
he had this old guitar.
there was always music coming out of this kid.
crazy what that kind of thing means over there.
good guy to have around.
he was the one.
thanks to McCartney, Hall died looking at us instead of them.
Patterson. You okay?
what are you doing here?
this is Agent Gibbs from NCIS.
Yeah, look, I heard about what happened to Torres, and that's really sad, but I hardly needed in-person notification, okay?
look, McCartney, can we just come in... - It's Patterson. What do you want?
you recognize him?
this guy was in Arghanda.
he was there that night firing on us. Do you remember him?
no. - He grabbed Hall.
he was one of the ones that you... - I said no!
you know, I was actually having a pretty good day today.
like, what the hell are you doing here? Huh?
where were you before?
I needed you before.
this... this I don't need.
bringing you here, that was my idea.
it's, uh... it's on me. That's my bad.
captain! Captain!
captain, this must be their base.
captain! Captain!
come on, Hall.
captain, stop!
Joe, it's me.
I remember the headquarters!
captain W. Abby Sciuto. I'm here to help.
you must be Sergeant W.
Yeah. - I love brothers.
I just found my second one at this animal rescue... - Abbs.
okay. Based on your After-Action Report,
I was able to whip up our very own version of the Arghanda ambush using
ta-da!-- virtual reality.
I'm more of a Super Mario guy myself.
well, since VR is being used to treat soldiers with PTS,
I think this will be better for your memory.
and it could help us find Kersey.
this, uh, Kersey's blueprint?
uh, yeah, well, the watermark led me directly to the U. S. Register of Historic Buildings.
so I'm comparing your piece to all the registered blueprints.
but I haven't had a happy little ding yet.
speaking of happy little dings, what's your oven situation for Thanksgiving?
cause I need, like, 40 minutes for my Aunt Gertie's caffeinated green bean casserole.
but I'm really excited that you're letting us just invite ourselves over...
Abbs. - Uh, Lady Lab Coat, my brother just turned this thing on.
it was him, he did it.
no, you did it. - Excuse me.
here we go.
okay, this is Lady Lab Coat, and I'm just gonna walk you through what we have.
you and your men are on foot patrol, and you see some gear inside an abandoned building.
you and Lieutenant Torres move inside.
this is crazy.
that's the headquarters?
Yeah, and your brother's gonna help me fill it in.
I saw a table... with a computer.
uh, some kind of satellite modem.
and the wall was covered...
...with documents, pictures, maps.
that's when I saw Ijil.
I saw a picture of Kersey.
clean-cut, like on his driver's license.
plans for his mission here?
could be, that's... that's all I got.
okay, well, let's, uh, move on then, to the ambush.
move, move!
it might be worth getting to the end.
no, I know how it ends.
maybe we can take a walk and try... - Damn it, Evan.
damn it.
look, Agent Gibbs, that's... I-I gave you all I got.
I'm done.
I'm sorry, good luck.
you're right-- straight to voice mail.
Yeah, so, when was the last time you saw him?
ms. Fenten, when was the last time you saw Mr. Kersey?
he's not on chat, either.
I mean, he's always on chat.
even when he's at my place, he's on my laptop on chat.
okay. So, who's he chatting with?
um, phone people-- he works at Bilson.
they're always helping each other with tech questions.
I can't believe he's not on chat.
well, like I told you, he's got a few things going on.
so, when was the last time you saw Mr. Kersey?
um, yeah, sorry. It was this morning.
he came over to say good-bye.
he said his business trip got moved up to today.
so, where was he going?
he was flying to Houston, but from there he was going all over.
maybe even India.
they were rolling out this new...
he was lying?
we've been together eight months.
I thought I knew him.
we're gonna need your laptop, check out his chats.
Yeah, of course, it's at my apartment.
and, uh, do you know anything about a blue sedan?
well, that sounds like his car.
fantastic, you got the plates?
I think it ends with a nine... - or a six.
um, sorry.
well, maybe you could find it through his uncle's name.
Randy's uncle left him that car when he died last year.
what's the uncle's name?
Kersey's only uncle, Daniel Kersey, died in 1989.
so, Randy lied to his girlfriend about where he got the car.
got her permission to keep an eye on her communications but it's doubtful he'll contact her.
bolo? - No hits.
not surprising without a license plate.
we went back to the convenience store like you suggested, and the manager remembers Kersey but nothing fishy.
e-mail, cell phone, credit cards--all inactive.
he knows we're on to him.
search area, McGee?
despite what Kersey told his girlfriend, he did not fly out this morning.
all airports, train stations and borders were secured and monitored beginning last night.
well, if he's behind the wheel, making minimal stops, driving the speed limit to avoid being pulled over, could be anywhere inside that 400-mile radius.
lot of places to hide.
you know, the girlfriend's computer might help narrow it down.
she said Kersey used it to chat up coworkers.
as a field technician, he had direct access to phone lines.
Tim. - On it, boss.
what about us?
figure out where to look for a guy who knows we're looking for him.
Ah, just in time for The Ballad of Randall J. Kersey.
it's a tragedy, I'm afraid.
Yeah, always is.
young Randall lost his parents to a car accident when he was just five years old.
bounced from one foster home to the next ran away from six of the eight.
he give a reason?
after each escape, he was recovered from the home of one of his classmates, begging the parents to let him stay.
he wanted a permanent family.
Yeah, well, like many terrorists organizations, the Ijil foster unshakeable bonds.
now that Randall Kersey has had a taste of such belonging, to return to a solitary life would be a sacrilege.
you think he's got help.
precisely. Where is he?
we're trying to find that out now, Duck.
no, I meant where is Captain Westcott, other than at the forefront of your mind?
uh, he's headed home.
doc okayed me getting into the ambush and then I pushed.
pushed too hard.
well, it's obvious that you feel a grave responsibility towards this young man.
Ducky, I sent home plenty of marines like Westcott, and-and I knew their heads weren't right.
I hoped that there would be someone on the other side to catch them.
you had no choice.
I mean, you had to stay behind. It was your duty.
I'm on the other side now.
I tried to catch Westcott.
I didn't. He wouldn't let me.
and when do you take "no" for an answer?
I'm angry, Ducky.
you can't fix the world, Jethro.
but you can call the boy.
Hello?
Hey, it's Gibbs.
Hey, Agent Gibbs. - Where are you?
you knew that he was on meds and you bring him here?
Hey, hey, hey, don't worry about it.
what, let me guess, you're a scotch man-- can you get him a scotch, neat, please?
you got it. - Come on, let's go, bud.
back off.
you're not my father.
he'd never come and check in on me.
he's always got better things to do, right?
wait, hey, hey, sit down... the flight doesn't leave till noon.
come on, man, let's get out of here.
you taking his side?
there are no sides here.
what are you doing taking his side, you're my brother.
Yeah, which is why I've let you beat on me last three days straight for no reason.
Oh, no, I got a reason.
mm, good, let's talk about it in the car, then.
you don't get what I've been through.
so don't try to act like you do. - I just got back from over there.
it's different.
I was in it out there, same as you, I saw guys die... - It's different!
how is it different?! It's the same damn thing!
come on, that's enough.
enough!
sit down.
it's different because you're okay.
back up.
sorry.
McGee, you're here early.
been here all night.
combing through Kersey's chats is a bigger job than I thought.
I swear, if I got to read one more thing about a malfunctioning VoIP system.
did you find anything?
chats are clean, just looking for any files he might have saved.
we're giving Kersey more hiding places by the minute.
Yup.
Hey, speaking of places, I hear you're going to the opera.
no, I'm not going to the opera, and that was the worst segue ever.
I know, it was forced.
Tony made me promise to ask you about it.
it's unbelievable, why can't he just leave it alone?
well, I think he thinks you're pretty serious about this guy.
I mean, the opera is one of the big three.
why can't you just leave it alone?
leave what alone?
what did I miss?
did you ask her?
Tony? - Did you tell him?
no. - Bingo.
what?
bingo is right, McVoyeur.
she's smoking in those shorts.
my Lord, there is something about a good strong ponytail, isn't there?
Tony, the car.
ladies and gentlemen, we have a plate.
stellar work, McGee, just, uh, shoot it over to me and I'll add it to the BOLO.
did she say anything?
leave it alone, Tony.
agent Gibbs, I signed off on you exploring the ambush for good reason.
the only way to stop a traumatic event from taking over your life is to face it.
doc, the kid is trying.
and failing, I'm sure.
even with regular therapy at home, the healing process is going to be rocky.
what about his recent encounter with Mr. Kersey?
asked him, got flustered, said there's too many details.
hypervigilance, re-experiencing, they're both symptoms.
he spots Kersey, and he's overwhelmed.
he sees everything around him as a threat.
would it help to get him back in the store?
retracing his steps could help him isolate what's important.
I'm not asking about the case. I'm asking about what would help Westcott.
I-I'm sorry, is there a problem?
well, yeah, Doc, there's a problem.
you served, right? - Iraq.
okay, then you know.
kids are going over and we're expecting them to come back the same.
the experience changes everyone.
what are we doing?
agent Gibbs... - What are we doing?
agent Gibbs, I would raise my hand all over again.
Yeah, so would I, so would Westcott.
but he is blaming himself for not doing more.
how do I help him?
two objectives in the treatment of PTS: rediscover sense of purpose, rebuild trust.
look, I get it.
you show up here, you offer me some ice cream and a balloon to stick around.
but I'm sorry, sir. I can't accept
case isn't closed. I still need your help.
I'm not staying in this room another day.
okay, then you can bunk with me.
rocky Road's in the freezer.
you're hilarious.
Yeah, I know. Get in the car.
see you at home, kid.
tell your dad I'm sorry about Thanksgiving.
you know, that was the first fight we've ever been in where we weren't on the same side.
look, I don't know what I was thinking letting him drink.
you weren't thinking.
it happens.
I knew it was wrong, but for a minute, I... He was himself.
you know, I had my old brother back.
find a way to love the brother you got.
try to get him to sleep, will you?
Yeah. You staying?
Yeah, we'll go back together.
whenever he's ready. - Okay.
can't believe the old bird just let you shut the place down so I could concentrate.
amazing what happens when you don't give the bird a choice.
you are a badass, Agent Gibbs.
okay, Captain, you're on.
no harm at all if we come out of here with nothing.
right.
all right, uh, I was right here, Lieutenant Torres was to my left.
and, uh... I, uh...
I first spotted Kersey at my one o'clock.
he's shifty. He picks up a can of soup, but he doesn't look at it.
it's just for show.
the bell rings.
and it's a girl with blue hair.
Torres is telling me that we gotta go.
come on, man. Let's get out of here. He's the wrong guy.
Hey, stay with Kersey.
he's on the move.
you got a problem, old man?
what are you looking at?
come on, Joe, let's go, man! Let's go!
let the rest go.
just Kersey.
it was a handoff.
that's good work.
you badass.
Hey, boss, sketch artist said Westcott gave her a good amount of detail.
that's some hairdo.
she shouldn't be hard to spot.
so we're thinking straight line from the Blue Bonnet to Kersey?
she knows something. Find out what.
now would be nice.
right. BOLO.
DiNozzo! - Yeah, boss?
taking it to the streets. Thanks.
change of plans.
Kersey's car just got spotted by state police on the G. W. Parkway.
tell the police no one goes in till we get there.
the whole grid, he's still on the Parkway?
NCIS! Keep your hands on the steering wheel!
hands, Kersey! Hands!
get out of the car. - Keep your hands up!
please don't shoot me!
Where's Kersey? - I don't know.
car's clear, boss.
superbad here is all alone.
when did you last see him? Where was he?
uh, yesterday Rock Creek Park.
um, he said I should get out of town right away, but I was so stoked to have the car, that I...
he paid me 200 bucks to take it and keep driving.
please don't shoot me.
talk to me.
Kersey's whereabouts still unknown.
Ziva's talking to his hired driver.
since he ditched the car, we're probably looking for something stolen.
kid puts him in Rock Creek Park yesterday at 12: 30 p. m.
that would adjust the radius to...
no, that's where he wants us to look.
the bigger, the better.
boss?
shut it down.
Kersey was working a plan, he got spooked.
a little visit to Interrogation sent him running?
no, he's not running. Underground.
he wanted us to follow the car while he stuck to his plan.
he's still in the neighborhood.
Kersey's driver does not know anything.
he's a runaway living on the streets.
parents are addicts.
I do not understand why Kersey's using these children.
it's better for him if we pick up some kid who doesn't know anything.
kids who want to belong, like he did.
he knows how to talk to them.
DiNozzo. Blue hair?
canvass was a bust.
convenience store manager was a little more helpful.
no name, but said that Marge Simpson is a regular.
you two, go.
don't come back without her.
Hey, Gibbs, um, I heard McGee say that he would like to spend more quality time with Tony.
so I thought, how about a "boys only" stakeout?
I pointed to you and DiNozzo.
Hey, cut the guy some slack, will ya?
it's the opera.
one of the big three.
let's go!
looked through this a few times, but nothing rings a bell.
my couch is a good bed.
Yeah, I can't sleep.
I had a girl that smiled like that when I stood next to her.
she, uh, wrote me letters, she kept me going.
and when I got back, I... I cheated on her.
I really loved that girl.
truth is, he and I... we're no different.
we run.
and we take down everybody else along the way.
you're nothing like him.
Torres was... - Gone when he hit the pavement.
there's nothing you could've done.
but Hall, Hall was different.
he needed me, and I just, I ran.
westcott... you're alive. You survived.
for what? This?
my dad won't even look at me.
I can't even look at my brother.
this thing is just, it's just... it's eating me alive.
even Patterson.
that kid was Superman, and now he...
the only way to beat this is to keep on fighting.
and it wouldn't hurt to let the rest of us have a few whacks from time to time.
Yeah, well, I think the sun is officially up, so let me be the first to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving.
gobble, gobble.
how about the boss playing the big host this year?
turkey legs by the fire.
shut up!
I'm sick of you sitting in this car being nice to me.
my deepest apologies.
you're only being nice because you want me to tell you what you want to know.
then tell me and I'll stop being nice.
there's nothing to tell.
fine. I'll make it up.
he's a veterinarian!
stop raising your voice.
I can't be nice, I might as well be loud. Does he make you laugh?
you're such a child.
and then you wonder why I cannot talk to you.
so, he's a hilarious veterinarian who likes the opera.
why do you care?
I thought we were past caring about these things!
past them?
look, I don't care who this guy is.
I just thought we were, you know, telling each other things about things.
the things that... you know, matter.
Tony, there is no funny veterinarian.
there is no one, actually.
only Tali.
your sister?
I think about her every day, but this week is... this week is the most difficult.
it's when you lost her?
it's a birthday.
tomorrow, actually.
tali used to sing Puccini, and even my father's eyes would get filled with tears.
you know, her dream was to be on stage.
so every year on her birthday, I go to the opera in honor of her.
but this year, this year was...
it's sold out. - Yes.
and I know it sounds really... silly, but I feel like I'm...
like I'm letting her down, and...
the love of a sibling is...
well, I'm lucky, lucky to have known it.
got her.
what do you want?
NCIS. We need to talk.
look, I didn't do nothing.
lay off the double-negatives. They confuse her.
Randall Kersey. Where is he?
what are you asking about him for?
why don't you tell us?
it's just some guy.
come and bring us food sometimes.
you know, odd jobs to make money.
he was nice.
he handed you something inside this store last Saturday night.
a piece of paper. What was it?
instructions.
he didn't talk details in person.
but, look, the jobs were never anything bad.
you know what we're gonna ask you next.
we met at this coffee shop sometimes.
that note said I should be there today at 10: 00.
Why?
he was gonna give me some box to drop off at Union Station.
it was nothing bad.
that's my girl.
on time as always.
now, you know where this is going...
...but I'd like to know when it's done.
I think we're pretty much done right now.
I'm sorry to cut your holiday plans short, Mr. Kersey.
Where's the other one?
we know there's two.
there's nothing at the train station.
so where did you send it?
who are you working with?
some other kid you bought?
what... What, that's it?
Where's he going?!
guy actually has a conscience.
Gibbs is gonna take a hammer to it.
you know, boss doesn't let too many people back here.
he asked, and I said yes.
it's closure.
private Christopher Gomez.
Nineteen.
left behind two little brothers and a mother.
the mom says that he took care of everyone.
killed in action by the Ijil Rebels.
you're not just killing blank faces, Randall.
Where's the bomb?
corporal Troy Baroni.
22 years old.
Gibbs has him.
those are my men.
you okay?
coward won't even look at them.
look at them!
look at him.
private First Class James Hall.
wife waiting at home, pregnant with a baby girl.
you remember him?! No one else needs to get hurt!
where is the bomb, Kersey?!
Where's the bomb?!
my name... is Sulayman al-Janfi.
the Ijil are my brothers.
today, I failed them.
but that night, I got one more savage than I thought.
you son of a bitch!
say his name! Get off him!
you say his name! You say his name!
get off me! Let him go! Get off him!
private First Class James Hall! Private First Class James Hall!
get him off me!
she was in the headquarters on the wall! She's part of it!
who? - His girlfriend!
doing fine. Dorneget dropped him off with his brother.
let's go.
Brooke Fenten, age 29. Never been to Afghanistan.
ponytail played us.
said the car came from the uncle.
told Kersey what was up, he hired a driver.
she threw his chats in my face.
I hate her, no matter how good she looks in those shorts.
it is unclear how she is linked to the Ijil, but...
I don't care. Skip it. Where is she now?
uh, well, didn't answer her cell, nobody's home.
McGee. - Work schedule on her computer has her catering a Thanksgiving event tonight.
where? - Still working on it. No address listed.
Gibbs! Gibbs! Gibbs! - Gibbs trifecta. Nice.
I finally got a match on the blueprint from Kersey's basement.
it was on the historic register.
this home belongs to Senator Geoffrey Roberts.
boss, Senator Roberts is hosting the members of the Joint Economic Committee and their families for Thanksgiving.
it's all over the news.
take a big bite out of Congress with one hit.
saddle up.
event security has to be U. S. Capitol Police.
call on the way.
Abbs, get me the address.
okay, but... you'll be back by turkey time, right?
device?
in the kitchen-- it was found in one of the food storage bins.
bomb squad already has it disarmed, but...
boss, they lost Fenten.
do we know she was here?
multiple witnesses saw her at the party.
no sightings after the police entered.
her staff doesn't know anything. They all look clean.
roadblocks are out.
she's got to be on foot.
boss. I found this stuffed in a closet.
she could be hiding inside the house.
no, she always had a plan to get out.
I'm glad you came back.
I, uh... saw what happened through the window.
um... I wanted to come out, but... - Oh, I don't blame you.
I'm... I must've looked like a deranged Forrest Gump out here.
my head's messed up, McCartney.
it-it sucks saying that, but...
maybe you should think about talking to someone, too.
see about picking up that guitar again.
Yeah, I don't know if I have it in me.
you already ran head-on at the enemy once.
Yeah, you got it in you.
he means how you got Hall and brought him back to us.
what? N... That... that wasn't me, Captain.
that was you.
captain! Captain!
captain!
okay, okay, I'm here.
come on, Hall. Come on.
I didn't run away.
you didn't run.
forgive yourself for the rest.
I just wish it would've mattered.
the general never ran from anything.
it mattered.
to us.
are you heading over?
Yeah.
Abby was so excited Gibbs moved Thanksgiving to tonight.
listen, I told the boss that, uh, you're gonna be a little late.
come on, Tony, you've seen me drive.
I'm never late.
did you know that McGee installed a crazy surround sound system in here?
I came in one night, and he was playing video games wearing a cape.
I know it's not the same, but...
maybe if you closed your eyes, it'd be like you were at the opera.
and maybe even like...
tali's there with you.
thank you.
merry Christmas.
welcome home, Commander.
Hey, Joe. - How was the tour?
too long. - Your house looks great.
Thanks.
I see my husband didn't exactly knock himself out with ours.
well, happy holidays.
what's that terrible smell?
I thought he'd pick me up at the airport last night, but when he didn't show, I had to take a cab.
where were you?
the Gulf. Aboard the Stennis.
for the last six months.
when was the last time you spoke to your husband?
Thanksgiving.
when I called him.
that was almost a month ago.
Where'd your husband work? - Work?
he was an unemployed Navy husband, Agent Gibbs.
thank you, Commander. Appreciate it.
don't take this the wrong way, Dr. Mallard.
I love my job-- I really do
but I will never get used to the odor of a decomposed body.
Ah, yes.
the pungent bouquet of hydrogen sulfide and methane.
with a faint hint of corpus mercurium captans.
well... thank God there's no maggots.
that would make it a perfect day at the office.
well, no sign of forced entry, boss.
nothing appears to be missing.
how's long has he been here, Duck?
educated guess?
three or four weeks.
well, that works.
based on postmarks, mail's been collecting since November 27.
anything else?
no visible wounds.
hopefully, cause of death will be determined at autopsy.
neighbors we spoke to hadn't seen him in weeks, but they said that wasn't unusual.
his employment record was spotty.
sorry, it's my flight app.
dad's plane's been delayed.
Huffner never lasted long on a job, had not worked in over a year.
he was also estranged from the rest of his family.
record?
any criminal record? - No.
uh, well, I mean, there was a DUI back in... in 2009.
there's a storm in New York.
it's always complicated with Senior.
Where's your dad going? - Going?
Oh, I wish.
he's coming. Here.
he says he wants to spend Christmas with me.
you did not tell us your father would be coming to town.
I didn't really think it was going to happen.
because something always comes up, doesn't it?
well, I think it sounds wonderful.
well, I don't.
we're not... It doesn't... It always ends up in an argument.
still decorating?
Christmas is only four days away.
no. No. Christmas is three days, 14 hours, 27 minutes and three seconds away.
what do you got?
Oh, uh, the contents of the victim's pockets.
Where's his clothes?
still in the air dryer. Trust me, you do not want to deal with them right now.
Oh, I like the addition of the carolers.
thank you.
Huffner's phone is dead.
just like him.
he's got... two 20s, one ten and two singles.
men are so simple.
my wallet is bulging; you can't even close the snap.
it would take hours to go through all the cards.
he has two.
Oh, there's another bill in here.
must be his emergency stash.
what is this?
doesn't look like any $100 bill I've ever seen.
it's authentic.
you're kidding.
old Ben Franklin looks like he's on steroids.
we call it the New Benjamin.
it was designed to replace all existing $100 bills.
where did NCIS get this?
found it on a dead body.
something's very wrong here.
this new currency hasn't been put into circulation yet.
none of it has ever left our control.
or been outside a Treasury building.
over a decade of research and development went into the New Benjamin's security features.
let me show you.
the changes include color-shifting numbers and Liberty Bell, a 3-D ribbon and raised printing.
it's counterfeit-proof.
when's it going to be put into circulation?
initially, the bills were going to be released in February 2011, but there were production problems and distribution was delayed.
so what's the problem?
well, um, because of all the new security features, it proved to be a very difficult bill to produce.
um, during the printing process, there were little creases in the notes.
little creases?
it's kind of a technical thing.
sorry.
um, much to our embarrassment...
...uh, bills with a face value of $110 billion were printed.
we're not exactly sure how many of them are flawed, but estimates go, uh, to, uh, 30%.
you'd get a big head slap in our building for that.
that's... that's a big number. So heads rolled?
no, we-we really don't get into finger-pointing here at the BEP, Agent Dinozzo.
where are the bills now?
in vaults in Fort Worth, Texas, and here in Washington.
sorry. I...
it's Senior. I'll make it quick.
let me check the serial number.
Hi, Dad.
no, I'm in the middle of an investigation.
No! That does not work for me.
No! Take a cab!
the serial number is from an early batch that was shredded and disposed of a year and a half ago.
obviously, it wasn't.
secret Service Special Agent Ashley Winter.
heard NCIS was in the building.
would've appreciated a call.
how much more is missing, Donald?
um, I-I don't know.
I-I just heard about this.
and, uh, but we're-we're gonna get into it.
when we first found the flaw, we shredded millions of dollars' worth of the New Benjamins.
it's what we routinely do with any worn or damaged U. S. currency.
I'll keep this.
it's property of the Treasury Department.
no. No, I-I don't think so... Ashley Winter.
no, it's evidence in an NCIS death investigation.
records show that Noel Huffner never gained access to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing building.
and we have not been able to connect him to anyone there.
so how'd he get the bill?
Hey, guys!
look who I found down in the lobby.
dad, what are you doing here?
Ziva, show me some love.
dad, I thought you were taking a cab from the airport to the hotel.
no hotel.
I came to spend Christmas with you.
good to see you, A.D. - Nice to see you.
happy holidays, Mr. Dinozzo. - Same to you, Tim.
I don't understand.
where are you staying?
at your place.
No! No, no, no, no.
because it's... it's not big enough.
Oh, come on, Junior.
you've got room.
doesn't he?
um, I... I would not know.
I've never been invited.
is that true?
what's the matter with you?
you're gonna be spending the holidays together.
it's so sweet!
no. Yes, of course.
but not in... because here's the thing.
it's a one-bedroom.
it's so small. It's like a Habitrail.
but I'm gonna call the Adams House.
I'm gonna get you a sweet suite, my treat.
no, no, no, no, Junior, I wouldn't hear of it.
I'll sleep on the couch if I have to.
you do have a couch?
happy holidays. Adams House. Laurel speaking.
come on, Tony.
Hello? Hello?
okay, that'd be great.
so, you'll be joining us Christmas Eve?
Tony's started this tradition where we all watch It's a Wonderful Life together.
Abby, if you're going to be there, I wouldn't miss it.
junior. - Dad.
I don't get it. Autopsy's done.
usually Agent Gibbs has been down here by now.
methinks you have just spoken of the devil, Mr. Palmer.
what do we know?
cause of death was a broken neck.
shattered the C-6 and C-5 vertebrae.
almost severed the spinal cord.
he didn't die in that chair, Jethro.
it was definitely a homicide.
anything else?
well, although it didn't kill him, Mr. Huffner had cirrhosis of the liver.
he was likely a heavy drinker.
all right, here we are.
junior... not what I expected.
Yeah, my girl, there you go.
there's some treats. That's my good girl.
you're getting fat.
my goldfish.
her name is Kate.
how long have you lived here?
almost 12 years.
you want to wash up before we eat?
sure. Should we cook something here or go out?
I don't really keep a lot of food in the house, Dad.
we'll go out.
all right, Dad, you're gonna stay in my room, and I'll hit the couch.
that's your bed?
Yeah.
not much room for play.
well, when I come home, Dad, I sleep alone.
you're serious?
dad, this is my sanctuary. Okay?
if I'm going to see a lady, I will stay at her place.
that way, I can leave when I want and nobody overstays their welcome.
what?
you're missing so many things-- intimacy, commitment.
you know, I'll see if we can get a reservation at the rooftop grill.
hope it's not my fault.
Hey, this is Anthony Dinozzo.
can I get a table for two up on the rooftop?
Abby... what are you doing?
lifting prints.
this ornament has been in my family since the 1890s.
it was my great-great- grandmother's.
so I'm trying to identify as many relatives that have handled it as I can.
I already found my Great Uncle Gooper and my Aunt Trixie.
ask her how she got a match.
I used to fingerprint all my relatives at our reunions.
I started when I was 11 years old.
you got anything on Huffner's computer or cell?
uh, not really, but... - We have something much, much better.
besides Noel Huffner's fingerprint,
I also found someone else's on this C-note, and reliable old AFIS got us a match.
you gonna give me a name?
second print belonged to a Justin Cannady, and it gets better, boss.
not only did he work at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing; he was fired from there last year.
Huffner was working with an inside man.
Tony... you all right?
no. I slept on the couch last night.
I got a kink in my neck and kinks in my back-- it's killing me.
What'd you find out?
Justin Cannady was not at his apartment.
secret Service had the place locked down and would not let us in.
we should have searched the place ourselves before we told Agent Winter.
she issued a BOLO but couldn't stop us from questioning Cannady's neighbors.
no one had seen him in weeks.
you able to connect Cannady to our dead Navy husband?
not yet.
so you have just been lying down on the job while we were gone.
Timmy, remote.
check out his credit score.
it's lower than McGee's self-esteem in high school.
Cannady is broke.
unemployment insurance ran out last month, car was repo'd, he's two months behind on his rent.
Oh, my God.
where did that Susan B.
Anthony dollar go?
she likes to roll.
Oh, Agent Winter, what are you doing here?
I was summoned to brief you.
Cannady worked at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing until last June.
why'd he get fired?
poor performance.
tardiness and being drunk on the job.
Cannady lost two fingers in an accident.
Ouch.
he operated a shredding machine.
assistant Director Linder had to let him go.
Linder-- isn't that the squirrelly guy that we talked to?
coworkers heard from Cannady since?
no. - Is more money missing?
no way of telling.
you think Cannady killed your Navy husband?
your agents turn up anything at Cannady's apartment?
no. They tore that place apart.
I'd like to do the same to Huffner's house.
no, that's not gonna happen, Agent Winter.
that's on a Navy base.
you handled Cannady's apartment.
now, Special Agents Dinozzo and McGee were just leaving.
it's always a pleasure.
I went to use my credit cards at the Navy Exchange this morning, and they were both declined because my slug of a husband drew $5, 000 against each of the cards.
he forged my signature.
what was he up to?
that's what we're trying to find out, Commander.
well, do you at least know how he died?
Yeah, he was murdered.
we suspect he was involved in criminal activity with a man named Justin Cannady.
do you know him?
never seen him.
you aware that your husband had a liver condition?
no, but I'm not surprised. He drank too much, and I always knew where to find him.
where was that?
gillespie's Saloon on Prescott Street.
so do you know when I'm gonna be able to get into my house again?
there are things that I have to do.
we'll let you know when we're finished.
did you find anything downstairs?
done in the bedroom.
Yeah, well, you always have to suspect the wife.
she was halfway around the world.
she could have hired someone.
listen, I need you to crack my back.
go to a chiropractor.
I don't have time. I need it now.
all right, if I do it this once, will you stop complaining?
no complaining.
you're a buddy.
Oh, that's good, that's good.
okay, let me just relax.
now just give me a little bounce.
one more. More.
whose is that?
it's mine.
just put me down real slow. Real slow.
thank you. I'm a little light-headed.
Hey, Dad.
where do you keep your roasting pan?
dad, I don't have a roasting pan. I don't cook.
what are you doing?
I'm getting ready for a traditional Dinozzo Christmas dinner.
takes days of prep.
traditional dinner?
listen, Dad, can you hold off, please?
cause I... We'll talk about it tonight. Okay?
you should appreciate your father.
I never had family traditions.
well, we haven't had them for years.
traditions kind of died with my grandfather.
senior was kind of an absentee parent.
you know, long-standing customs kind of... disappeared.
along with a certain family signet ring.
it was always passed on to the next generation on the Christmas of the son's 21st birthday.
I never got it.
senior claimed it was stolen.
"I was mugged, Junior." But I think he pawned it during the bad times.
Hey, come over here and help me with this, will you?
sure. Thank you for that, by the way.
much better. - Yeah.
all right, we're gonna lift this right here.
all right, ready? One, two, three.
Oh, look at that.
they don't open till 4: 00.
maybe he's setting up.
let's check around back.
hello. NCIS Special Agents Gibbs and David.
you got a minute?
NCIS? What's this about?
I'd like to talk to you about Noel Huffner.
okay. Um, I got to open in a half an hour.
you mind if we talk inside?
Nah. I recognize the grill. It's a '53, right?
it was my old man's.
the original Gillespie, he bought it new.
Huffner's wife said he's a regular here.
Yeah.
and I've talked to her a couple of times.
she calls here when he won't answer his cell.
problems in the marriage?
I think I'm gonna invoke bartender/patron confidentiality.
I don't want to get a regular in trouble.
you're not gonna get Huffner in trouble. He's dead.
I guess that's why I haven't seen him in a while.
he's a young guy. What happened?
do you know him?
Yeah. Justin.
I don't think I ever heard his last name before.
Justin and Huffner know each other?
Oh, yeah.
the two of them sit down there at the end of the bar just about every night, like Cliff and Norm.
I haven't seen Justin in a while, either.
well, if Justin comes in, would you give us a call?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, um... You never told me how Noel died.
he was murdered.
what are you doing?
what's it look like?
decorating the Christmas tree.
beautiful, isn't it?
big, full, great.
you moved my piano.
well, I had to put the tree in the window.
Oh, what... what happened in here?
is this how you're going to react to all the hard work I did today?
I baked your favorite Christmas cookies.
snickerdoodles.
used your mother's recipe.
I knew your staying here was a mistake.
look... this is my apartment, okay?
this is my space.
junior... chill. Chill.
get the Christmas spirit.
I'll get it.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
look, we can't let her know that we're here.
I know you're home, Tony.
ignore her.
who is she?
she's the bloodhound from across the hall.
have you closed the deal on that?
dad!
all right, listen, something's come up at work. I got to go.
well, when will you be home?
I don't know.
hikers found the body just before sunset.
there's no I. D.
duck, why'd the LEOs think it was Cannady?
he's missing the appropriate two digits.
how long has he been dead?
Oh, I'd venture the same amount of time as Mr. Huffner.
Oh, great! I got my maggots!
this is shaping up to be one disgusting week.
Aw, hell.
get the body into the van.
don't need Agent Winter snooping around.
let's go, Mr. Palmer. Chop-chop. One, two, three.
boss is gonna head her off at the pass.
Hey, Winter. - Agent Gibbs.
what do we got? - I don't know.
may or may not be Cannady.
I don't think you're gonna make it down that way in those heels.
no... Come on, I'll show you a better way.
look-- it's right there.
and she's clueless.
agent Winter has no idea what she's up against.
nicely done.
well, with Cannady dead, we're looking for another killer.
Noel Huffner had $400, 000 of the new, uncirculated $100 bills at his house.
and all the serial numbers came from a batch that was supposedly shredded on May 2, 2011.
and Justin Cannady was working at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing as a shredder.
it is safe to say he was involved.
right. So the questions are: How much more might have been stolen, and how'd they get it out of such a heavily secured building?
that a snickerdoodle? - Yes.
Where'd you get 'em?
senior. He bakes. Who knew? Would you like one? Ziva?
no. Uh, so you think the $10, 000 that Huffner borrowed from the credit cards has anything to do with this?
what if Huffner bought some of the New Benjamins at a discount from his bar buddy, Cannady?
you know, like,$10, 000 for $400, 000?
think about it-- Cannady couldn't spend any of the new currency until it was put into circulation.
but he was in debt and needed money.
maybe he got antsy and decided to... sell some of the uncirculated cash to Huffner.
well, that may all be true, but why are they both dead?
what am I looking at?
fibers, magnified a thousand times.
these eensy-weensy little buggers were statically attracted to the shrink-wrap on the currency hidden in Huffner's house.
what are the fibers?
particles... of shredded New Benjies.
the money was heavily guarded in a vault until some of it was shredded for disposal.
watch this.
Voilà.
the New Benjies left the building... in the trash.
Yeah, I know it's our first Christmas as a married couple, and I want it to be special, but I... Breena, I got to go.
special Agent Winter, isn't it?
is that the body I didn't get to see last night?
does Special Agent Gibbs know that you're down here?
have you made a positive identification yet?
well, you must understand how difficult it is to lift a fingerprint from a body that has been exposed to the elements for so long a time.
first, you must carefully remove the dermis.
then, using your own gloved hands, you spread the dermis over a corresponding finger.
roll it in the ink and then on paper.
and have you been able... - I first used the process when I was in India.
Yes, in the city of Allahabad.
Dr. Mallard, cut the crap.
tell me what you know.
if I find out you're impeding a Secret Service investigation, do you understand...
this is an NCIS investigation, and Dr. Mallard is doing exactly what he needs to be doing.
I thought we were gonna work with each other, Gibbs.
we are. Tell her what you know, Duck.
we have a positive identification.
this is Justin Cannady.
the cause of death, cervical fracture.
identical to Mr. Huffner's, I might add.
anything else?
Yeah, just got a lead. We need to talk to Assistant Director Linder.
you're not doing it without me.
wouldn't think of it.
it's very unlikely that any of the currency was removed from the vaults.
I've got $400, 000 of your new bills at NCIS that says you're wrong.
I don't know, okay?
all bills that are removed from the vaults are shredded, compacted into bales and disposed of.
where?
that was a year and a half ago.
we have contracts with several different landfills.
okay, well, we'll narrow it down for you, Donald.
which one was used on May 2 of last year.
be assured we're gonna be shaking up things in this department.
try the Adams County Landfill in Virginia.
Thanks, Chris.
Hi, Santa. - Hi, sweetheart.
Tony's out in the field.
did he know you were coming?
no, I'm, uh, here to deliver presents.
and this is for you, my dear.
thank you.
even though I do not celebrate Christmas, I love the holiday season, and I'm very glad you and Tony are going to be together.
I'm not so sure that, uh, Tony feels that way.
things not going well?
I think I'm trying to make up for too many missed Christmases all at once.
well, maybe trying too hard
well, Junior's the only family I have left.
after his mother died, it... it just hasn't been the same.
he showed me a picture of her.
she was really beautiful.
Mm-hmm, inside and out.
she was the love of my life, Ziva.
I've never been able to fill up that void.
but God knows I've gotten into a lot of trouble trying.
Hey, man. How are you?
Hey, man. - Hey, man. Good to see you.
you guys know each other?
Yeah, we went to school together.
M. I.T. - M. I.T?
and now you work... here.
last I heard, you were teaching computational evolutionary biology.
I was.
burnt out, man, but I found my calling, trash.
crazy, huh?
you know you can learn more about mankind by what it throws away than you can in any classroom?
what are you doing, Timmy?
I'm a federal agent, NCIS.
shut up. No way.
you're packing a gun.
this was one crazy dude in college.
really knew how to have a good time.
shut up. No way.
did he tell you he was the school mascot?
no. What was the M. I.T. mascot?
really doesn't matter.
Oh, yes, it does.
a beaver.
he was Tim the Beaver our senior year.
please tell me you dressed up like a beaver.
of course he did.
little teeth, just... Remember the...
Yeah.
listen, Stewart, we're trying to track down a batch of shredded currency that came from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing on May 2, 2011.
let's see, May 2, 2011, uh, that'd be in G sector, and by now, about 30 feet under.
uh, we had a break-in that night.
police came to investigate, shared a laugh.
what would anyone steal from the dump?
I think we may have the answer.
Yeah, I know you're a smart guy, Stewie, but how do you remember the exact date of the break-in?
everybody remembers where they were that day.
don't you?
it was the night the Navy SEAL team took out bin Laden.
dad? - Junior?
this looks fantastic.
what do you think, Kate?
I didn't even know it could look like this.
candles and everything.
you know, you were right.
this was a good idea.
thank you.
Hey, listen.
maybe you want to grab some dinner?
uh, I'll be right with you.
didn't expect you back so soon.
obviously.
didn't mean for you to see that.
it's forever etched into my retinas.
Hi, Tony.
call me later.
I'll have to burn the bed now.
Aw, come on, Junior.
don't make a big deal out of this.
well, you nearly pulled it off.
you know? It was almost like old times.
have to go just a little too far.
what can I say?
I'm me. I'm not going to change.
I know. I know you're not going to change.
and I don't know why I was smiling,'cause there's nothing funny about this.
dad, this is my home.
I told you, my rules, okay?
and you broke them.
it was a mistake having you here for Christmas.
you want me to leave?
aren't you gonna open your cookies?
I thought you were not supposed to open presents until... Christmas morning.
snickerdoodles don't count.
I'm worried.
about Tony and his father.
did he say what happened?
no. Just that it was complicated.
Where's Dinozzo?
he's on his way.
what did you find out at the landfill?
they had a break-in.
security cameras?
no. Not much there worth protecting.
boss, do you remember that night?
may 2, 2011?
no. - Bet you do.
it's the night Navy SEALs killed bin Laden.
so we raid Abbottabad, and we kill the most wanted man in the world.
got to think Homeland put the DC area on high alert and increased surveillance.
Yeah. They have to be concerned about retaliation.
I should get some credit.
I fired Justin last June.
the damage was done by then, Linder.
and, as assistant director of operations, you're going to be held responsible.
Hey, it's Gibbs.
secret Service is under Homeland now.
let me guess, Agent Gibbs.
you need something.
we need to access archival satellite surveillance of the DC area.
what's going on?
I'll make some calls.
I can give you a ride to the airport.
Ah, no, no, you're... you're already late for work.
sorry things didn't work out.
me, too.
Bye, Junior.
can you enhance it?
it's nighttime, Gibbs.
we can try.
going in tighter and enhancing.
sorry I'm late, boss.
your dad?
Yeah, well, we hit a little bump in the road.
Oh, no, but he can't miss the Christmas Eve party.
sorry, Abbs.
where is he?
he is on his way to the airport. He's going back to New York.
it's a little better.
well, it looks like a pickup truck, but because of the lack of light and angle,
I can't get a read on the license plate.
uh, I don't need it.
NCIS. Merry Christmas.
you're closing early today, Gillespie.
I am?
we have a warrant to search the premises and your residence.
what are you looking for?
uncirculated $100 Treasury notes.
merry Christmas, gentlemen.
drinks are on the house.
wait, what are you doing?
this photo was taken at a Virginia landfill the night the money went missing.
looks a lot like your truck.
just your luck Big Brother was watching that night.
the two figures-- you and Justin Cannady?
or did Cannady do it alone 'cause he was broke and tired of waiting?
he sell some of his share to Huffner without telling you?
is that why you killed them?
you worried that they were gonna blow it for you?
no, uh... - Retired Marine?
Yeah, so?
you had access to the base at Pax River.
we'll get the video, and we'll place you there.
once we find the money, it will all fall into place.
look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way, but we're not leaving here without the money.
Oh, is she getting warmer, Gillespie?
Oh... that got your attention.
there's a safe in my office closet.
stealing the money your idea?
it sure as hell wasn't that drunk Justin Cannady's idea.
Yeah, but you needed him to pull it off.
Ziva? There's a safe in the closet.
come on.
Hey, you know, we can wrap this up and still have time for the screening in MTAC.
I'm really not in the mood.
come on, Tony, it'll cheer you up.
Yeah, I left the DVD in my apartment anyway.
so go get it.
not only were we able to recover several million dollars of stolen, uncirculated currency, but two murders were solved in the process.
are there any questions?
Yeah, I got one.
you get any help from NCIS?
can you believe it? She did not even mention us.
Ah, it's Christmas, Ziva-- let it go.
our gift to her.
Yes, the mulled cider is good this year, but it's not quite the same.
I tried to remember how Tony made it.
maybe I left something out.
probably the seven pods of cardamom?
don't even know what that is, Tony.
neither do I, to tell you the truth.
sorry I'm late.
I got distracted.
even when he's not around, Senior can have an effect on me.
look what I found under the tree.
Oh, the family ring.
it's beautiful.
that's why he was here.
he wanted to make amends, and I blew it.
that's Abby.
may I see it?
Yeah. It's got a diamond.
you know, the origin of signet rings dates back to ancient Mesopotamia.
royalty used them to authenticate and seal documents.
hope you didn't start the movie yet.
got something for you, Dinozzo.
Thanks, Gibbs.
merry Christmas, everyone.
Hey, Dad.
Thanks.
merry Christmas.
I love you.
I love you, son.
you're disturbing the fish.
it's January, Dad.
they are long gone.
just where do you think they went?
South. Duh. Can we go now?
my dad used to bring me out here.
health teacher says abuse is passed down.
I'm just saying this is a good time to talk, man to man.
about what?
school, girls... sex.
Oh, not this again.
this must be a monster.
shouldn't be afraid to tell me things.
I'm not a virgin anymore.
What?!
I was just kidding.
very funny.
Oh, my God! There's probably a dead guy down there.
cool.
remember this?
room service?
Ah, same undercover operation where I wore this... briefly.
uh, yeah. How about this one?
from my perspective I see the woman from the big jet plane
the woman look...
Oh, yeah, you guys weren't there for that.
you know, I get why they want to free up space in the storage room, but... who's gonna want any of this old junk?
I'm keeping the soul patch.
what's that?
I remember that case.
that's the pregnancy pact.
you looked good in that.
I feel like I'd remember these.
no, I wouldn't touch that.
I washed those, Tony.
they're yours?
you two were not there for that.
Finally!
I found something a little bit more practical.
the matching bra?
wrong kind of padding.
Oh, come on, when is there time to exercise?
have you seen what they did to the NCIS gym?
juice bar! Nice!
well, I make time outside of work
it's a good habit I picked up from my time in Mossad.
never sweat where you eat.
wrong bodily function.
Yeah, but it's the right idea.
grab your gear.
dead body in the Potomac.
getting a new belt, boss?
Nah, it's an old belt.
drug bust, 99.
it was so awesome.
when the cops got here, they sent in these divers who found the body.
his jacket was filled with rocks.
that's a total body dump, right?
you watched all this?
so what? I'm 13.
I'm so sorry.
thank you.
you know, if it wasn't for me and my dad, you guys would've never found the dead dude.
show some respect.
sorry, we - we shouldn't have stayed.
are you kidding?
dad, this is, like, the most bad-ass thing we've ever done together.
Yeah. - Thanks, Dad.
divers found the victim's I. D.in a pocket.
petty Officer Second Class Luke Grismer.
keep this item carefully.
no one's touched the ear since we've been here, Doc.
I was quoting the instructions Vincent Van Gogh gave to a prostitute when he handed her his severed right ear.
gardez cet objet soigneusement.
What'd he care? He cut it off.
Yeah, well, historians are now of the opinion that the ear could have been lost in a heated dispute between he and fellow painter Paul Gauguin.
I'm more interested in the dispute that someone had with our victim.
you got a cause of death, Duck?
well, I won't be sure of that until I get him back to Autopsy.
however, these gashes here, on his head, may explain how the ear was pulled so easily from his body.
otherwise, the body's in good condition.
Yes, well, you both know the effect that cold water has on preserving a body.
but in this case, his dermis has not even begun to decompose.
he hasn't been there long.
less than two days.
something wrong, boss?
something's missing.
didn't you just say that this was a petty officer second class?
there's only one chevron.
well, no sailor would willingly give himself a demotion.
McGee, run his print.
are you aware that Van Gogh's suicide has also been called into question?
he was shot in the stomach and died two days later.
uh, boss, we got a problem.
fingerprints are catalogued for all active service members, but there's no match.
so not only is this fellow not a petty officer of any class...
he's not military at all.
then why is he pretending to be?
well, this is interesting.
look what I found in the last box.
unless it is the real identity of our victim, I do not care.
what is it with you and old photos lately?
windows into our past.
they were fitting me for the prosthetic, Tony.
there's nothing embarrassing about it.
Oh, not embarrassing， telling.
you're smiling.
speaking of smiles, I think McGee has something.
Yeah, I got a lead on our body from a Metro missing persons report.
same build and bone structure.
hairline and color match.
looks like our lobe-less victim.
Tyler Wilkes was reported missing this morning, by his lawyer.
Wilkes. That sounds familiar.
his investigative reports have been published all over the world.
so he's a journalist.
he's more like a government paparazzi.
looking for photos of Kate Middleton with her top off, he's trying to catch the Pentagon with their pants down?
he sold photographs of opium smuggling on foreign Army bases last year.
they turned out to be digitally altered, right?
damage was already done.
no one's willing to hire him, but they'll all run his stories.
a man like that could have many enemies.
even more if they found out he was impersonating Navy personnel.
Wilkes had an article due two days ago.
drug use in Navy barracks.
what was his latest targets?
lawyer said she didn't know who the story was about; hadn't read it.
start with the real Petty Officer Grismer.
find out why Wilkes had his I. D. - We need more from the lawyer.
boss, she actually did mention something.
Wilkes has a large birthmark just over the dimple on his left buttock.
it's for body identification.
But-tock?- Buttock.
at the height of their rivalry between Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst, each ran a comic strip featuring a character called the Yellow Kid.
given both editors' history of sensationalized news coverage, the term "yellow journalism" was born.
let me guess, you're more interested in this journalist's death?
well, I was going to say "black and blue journalism."
you made a joke.
Yeah, well, bon mot aside, you're correct in guessing the cause of Mr. Wilkes' death.
not the head wounds?
no, no, no.
those were postmortem, likely sustained when the body was dragged along by the current.
no, the actual cause of death was exsanguination from internal bleeding.
I found evidence of multiple blows to his chest, abdomen and groin.
painful. Not deadly.
unless you have...
mononucleosis.
victim had mono, Duck?
probably didn't know it.
while the outward signs can mimic a moderate cold, the internal results are swollen glands and organs.
when he was attacked, he received a direct hit...
that split... his already enlarged liver.
death was an accident.
perhaps, but... given the manner in which the body was disposed, our killer not only knew that this had become a homicide, he tried to hide it.
showed his true colors.
Yes, yellow.
well, if it hadn't been for the serendipitous...
catch of the day, this body, well, might not have been found until spring.
petty Officer, thanks for coming in.
I'm Special Agent DiNozzo.
I believe this belongs to you.
Oh, man, you found it!
my chief would've conniptioned if I had to report I lost this puppy.
saved me a bunch of trouble.
our pleasure.
so... thanks.
aren't you a little curious why you're in an NCIS interrogation room?
or... why your I. D. is... in a sealed evidence bag?
uh, y-y... yeah, I guess that's kind of weird.
what's going on?
somebody was... trying to use it.
Really?
man!
y-you just want to warn me about identity theft?
because I'll make sure to check on my credit and stuff.
good. You do that.
but... aren't you a little curious who had it?
well, I'm not gonna press charges.
well... yeah, but we have to,'cause Tyler Wilkes is dead.
dead?
well, I didn't kill... I... I mean, who?
you're a fast learner, Luke, but if you lie again...
that bunch of trouble's gonna come from more than just your chief.
it was blackmail, man.
Wilkes said if I loaned him my I. D.he'd keep me out of his story.
about the drugs?
I just transferred to Norfolk.
I don't know anything about that.
Wilkes needed your I. D. for a reason.
we look alike.
he said he wanted to get into our barracks for research.
research on what?
I don't know. Honestly.
but you can't tell the guys.
angry enough to kill?
what's going on?
I came in, and they were all together.
I told Agent Dorneget to bring in Grismer's roommates one by one.
I'm not sure he knew we meant separately.
well, maybe they haven't had the chance to get their story straight yet.
if this is about some jerk reporter going through our quarters, we don't know anything.
and we don't care what Grismer told you.
Grismer's the only one missing, right?
so much for that.
petty Officer Kelso, you the leader of this, uh, little gang?
Yeah, sure. So what?
so, that makes you the lead suspect in the murder of Tyler Wilkes.
told you... we don't know anything.
but if the guy's dead, I guess we're not losing sleep, right?
right.
Wilkes was trying to embarrass the Navy with his story.
so you knew what the story was about?
don't you?
well, I got a good idea.
drugs.
not gonna let anyone smear the Navy.
I don't care who talks.
I want answers.
fine. I killed Wilkes. - No, I killed him.
it was me. - I did it.
seems you have a problem.
boss, what do you want us to do?
we can't arrest all of them.
why not? They confessed.
put them in the holding cell... until we can arrange a transfer.
that room's only meant for one person.
well, perhaps by morning, they'll be willing to talk.
is that legal?
so, what do you think? Will they go quietly?
I was already planning on doing some light cardio tonight.
good workout, Gus.
sorry about the nose.
no kiss for your father?
what are you doing here?
come. Let's go for a drive.
someday you must give me a proper tour of your city.
perhaps when it is warmer.
where is your protection?
they've usually given themselves away by now.
that is why they do not know I am in the country.
no one knows.
you're the director of Mossad, Abba.
that is impossible.
Ziva, Nothing is impossible, only difficult.
which makes this officially the stupidest thing you've ever done.
which is saying something.
don't you remember the last time you were here?
Yes. You said,sometimes, life surprises you.
surprise.
what is your business here?
my daughter has made no effort to visit me in the last two years, so I must go to her.
I am here for you, Ziva.
how long have you been here?
I arrived this morning, but waited until I knew you were alone.
what if someone saw you?
at your gym? - At all.
surely you still have enemies that want you dead.
you think?
Ziva... I do not walk straight lines.
as your Agent Gibbs would say,"this is not my first radio."
rodeo.
you could have at least called.
I did not want to be refused.
there's no other reason for your visit?
I promise you... my intentions are honorable.
no one will know I was here.
now, I have answered all your questions.
trippy.
look what McGee found!
it's my spy glasses from the first time I went undercover.
well, you never forget your first time.
a lot's changed since then, huh?
Yeah, some things haven't.
what do you got?
um, DNA and fingerprint samples from our holding-cell four.
our clique of confessed murderers are getting ripe and restless.
victim's apartment?
Yeah, no sign of a break-in or a struggle.
hmm, don't have a crime scene yet.
Yeah, or much else, either.
I mean, Wilkes owns a cell phone, a tablet computer, a bunch of high-end cameras, and... they're missing.
or destroyed.
could be our best shot to linking the murder to our stinky suspects.
got a BOLO on Wilkes's car?
uh, we're still waiting for a hit.
can I borrow Gibbs for just a moment?
okay, but bring him back when you're through.
what's up, Ziva?
my father's in town.
he came to see me last night.
alone.
even his own people do not know he's here.
I know it sounds bad, and this is the last thing you want to deal with, but I...
...I did not want to hide anything from you.
Why's he here?
spend time with me.
or so he says.
I know it sounds silly when I say it out loud.
not silly.
but suspect.
what do you want me to do?
spend time with your father.
Really?
and keep me updated.
of course.
until we know for sure what he's up to.
are you going to tell the Director?
director, I have your wife for you.
what line?
so, this is why you had to be in the office so early?
Garfield ship Nermal to the Kremlin again?
lasagna shortage in Damascus.
what are you doing here?
you left before we could talk this morning.
well, you could have just called.
true, but if I had told your assistant that the kids are spending the night at a friend's tonight and we have the whole house to ourselves, she might have misunderstood.
and you didn't want that message to get lost in translation.
that's right.
Plus, I wanted to personally convey the importance.
what's the occasion? - Us.
I'll clear my schedule.
better put out a memo.
yeah?
Shmeil lives outside of Tel Aviv now, in senior-living apartments.
but based on his level of energy, and his, um, tolerance for alcohol, you'd never know he's retired.
the old man has not changed.
he's no fan of yours.
uh... my fans become fewer by the day.
now, this is what retirement should look like.
that-that was not supposed to be there.
I was... undercover.
it's very convincing.
did you mean your retirement?
the world is changing.
and what about you?
you have disagreed with many of my past decisions as a father, and I have always hoped to make up for it when I am free from this responsibility.
but judging from the way you are looking at me, perhaps my sins are too great.
I think you're confusing retiring with repenting.
only the latter makes any difference to me.
then let this visit be a first step to my redemption.
was it a boy or girl?
it was not real.
I know, but what did you tell people when they asked you?
I said it was a girl.
what the hell's he really doing here, Gibbs?
thought you'd have an idea.
I do. I don't like it.
word at State has been Eli's on his way out at Mossad.
political climate's changing in Israel, Eli's too old-school.
they're looking for accountability.
as they should.
world's one incident away from nuclear war.
the last thing anyone wants is Eli David poking the bear with a stick-- including me.
thought you two were buddies.
I'm not calling the cops, I'm just asking him for his car keys.
that's what got me worried about this little visit.
I was just on with a friend at Homeland Security.
I asked about any high-level threats in the Capitol.
they know about Eli?
no. He's flying under everybody's radar.
but another name popped up.
Arash Kazmi's in town.
iranian Intelligence.
Eli's new VEVAK contemporary.
the two of them grew up on different sides of the same stretch of the Israel-Palestine border.
Kazmi moved to Tehran when he was nine.
what's he doing in DC?
stopover on his way back from the UN council.
Kazmi's first visit to the U. S.Eli just happens to be here.
director David wants to prove that he's still an asset by taking out a high-level target..
quickly and quietly, Gibbs.
you know you want to ride shotgun, Leon.
you gotta call it.
shotgun.
you have been playing with your phone all afternoon.
a new boyfriend you have not told me about or could it be business-related?
with you, it's always business.
leon, my old friend.
a little bird must have told you of my visit.
can't blame her.
on the contrary, Agent Gibbs. I counted on my daughter's loyalty to you.
we know about Kazmi.
you do not know as much as you think you do.
won't let you kill him, Eli.
I should hope not.
you're late.
please... won't you all come in?
I would ask you to sit, but, uh, we do not have much time.
thank you for coming, Director.
they think I'm here to kill you.
a misunderstanding, I hope.
otherwise, I have made a grave mistake in eluding my security detail.
I believe you... owe me something.
Ah, yes.
merely... an olive branch.
or rather its fruit.
thank you.
what is going on?
that's a damn good question.
my apologizes, Leon, but I knew you would never agree to this meeting or even believe that it was possible.
not without bloodshed.
we are here to prove otherwise.
a taste of home.
Arash and I grew up on opposite sides of the orchard where these olives were grown
the Israeli-Palestine border.
neither side claimed the land, so as children, we both picked the fruit.
he was taller than I was and always managed to reach the better harvest.
borders have since changed... as have allegiances.
temperaments have not.
israel remains too entitled.
iran cannot force its will upon the world.
not exactly inspiring a chorus of "Kumbaya " .
we agree on very little, but... we recognize the need for this kind of open and honest dialogue.
even if our governments do not.
which is why we have risked our lives to make this possible.
if either of our nations knew, we would both be dead.
so why do you need me?
you are aware that my position in Mossad is uncertain.
I know this because you have stopped taking my calls.
you were always the better politician.
and you want me to use those skills to make sure you stay in power.
not asking much, are you, Eli?
this could be the difference between war... or not.
leon, my friend...
...you and I were forged in blood, but peace can be our legacy.
I'll do what I can.
thank you.
I must go. My absence will be noticed.
of course.
I'm not sure what just happened.
the first step to redemption.
Yeah, McGee.
we found our victim's car in an off-airport parking lot at Reagan.
no video security and airlines have no record of anyone flying under the names Wilkes or Grismer.
based on the broken driver's-side window and the victim's blood on the floor, the fight started at the parked car.
we got our crime scene.
that's not all we got.
we also found all of the victim's stuff, including his camera.
unfortunately, the memory card was wiped clean.
likely the work of whoever killed Wilkes.
but what the killer didn't know is that the memory card is Wi-Fi enabled.
that a good thing?
the memory card automatically uploads photographs to the user's phone
or, in this case, the tablet we found under the backseat-- using a Wi-Fi or cellular signal.
auto backup.
we have all the photos the victim took before he was killed.
no clear shot of the face, but it's definitely the same person.
we could be looking at why Wilkes didn't get on that plane.
or maybe the killer himself.
got an I. D?
uh, all we've got so far is his coat and his...
hat, sold at... probably every department store everywhere and impossible to track.
but we'll try.
do it.
you're home early.
I haven't even had time to put dinner in the oven.
or change clothes.
you have to work late?
no, no, I'll be home for dinner.
but... Is that wine kosher?
what's Eli doing here?
you wouldn't believe it if I told you, but he and I need to talk unofficially.
beltway Burger on 36th has a drive-through.
but it doesn't have you.
or your mother's recipe for baked chicken.
it's important.
always is.
what time's dinner?
sundown. - Okay.
thank you. - Yeah.
so... we'll still have the house to ourselves after dinner, right?
you had your shot, baby.
been digging through Wilkes' tablet, boss.
found a draft of his latest story, explains his MO.
let's hear it.
well, our shady reporter was using the look-alike I. D.to fly standby on military cargo planes.
wilkes, posing as Grismer, was supposed to get on a flight the day he was killed.
but the Mystery Hat Guy is not one of our "I Am Spartacus" quartet.
based on the picture's time stamp, our petty officers had already reported back to Norfolk.
yeah? Why'd they lie?
um... Wilkes' story details the drug addiction of a former rack mate.
he's already getting treatment.
the Navy knows about the drugs.
but it never went public.
our Fab Four figured if Wilkes was already dead, the story would go away?
didn't want to be the ones to bring it up again.
so they copped to the murder instead.
not sure if that's loyal or stupid.
it's both. Cut 'em loose.
did you change clothes?
I have a dinner date.
shabbat dinner?
it is Friday night, but I have no idea what or who you are talking about.
just tell him "Agent Meatball" says hi.
he would not be joking with you if he did not like you, Tony.
believe me.
what is that?
Wilkes' killer.
sort of. - Why? Did we miss something?
Ziva... - It's nothing.
we're here if you need us.
you have been very quiet.
do you want to tell me what has changed since this morning?
wait.
did you lie about when you arrived in the country?
what is this about?
the truth.
Ziva, the truth has many faces.
tell me about this one.
I wanted you in that room today, Ziva.
more than Vance.
Wilkes recognized you and started taking pictures of you, did he not?
I wanted to put an end to your perpetual suspicion of me.
so you followed him to the car and you took his camera.
I wanted you to look at me like you did when you were a child.
with pride.
I saw that briefly today.
he fought back.
it was an accident.
but you knew if word got out that you were here, it would ruin everything you came to do.
I came to show you the good.
I needed to protect that.
an innocent man is dead.
you disposed of his body, and you lied about it.
Yes, I did.
but... why is that the only part of this that you can see?
because you were right.
your sins are too great.
so be it.
but will you please... sit across from me at the dinner table one last time?
Thanks.
here you go. - No, thank you.
you have gone out of your way in welcoming me, Jackie.
the candles, the meal.
truly a Shabbat feast.
the magic of Internet research.
thank you.
you even have the challah.
store-bought since this was all last minute.
I have caused you trouble.
to clean slates.
for all of us.
forgive me, Leon, but the blessing before we drink.
Oh, uh, it's hard to keep it all straight.
no, no, no.
Ziva used to say the same thing when she was young.
but the purpose of these traditions is to always remind us of what God has given.
life, freedom and family.
my father killed Tyler Wilkes.
federal agent! Stop!
hands in the air!
Gibbs. - What happened?
I do not know. I saw the shooter and went after him.
get back to the house.
the shooter is wounded, Gibbs.
I'm not gonna lose him.
I'm coming to you.
Tony. - Call an ambulance.
you okay? -I'm fine. He's not.
stopped to rest.
when a wounded animal has lost too much blood, it knows it can no longer run.
Yeah, so he hides. - Yeah.
got blood.
director Vance?
you're bleeding. - It's not mine.
I need more towels!
hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
federal agents! - We know you're in there! We're coming in!
keep your hands where we can see them!
hands!
I did not expect you to come after me.
rather than checking on your father.
what about him?
who are you?
a man with one last job to do.
do you have a light?
there's poison in the cigarette.
spit it out.
put him on the side.
get him on his side.
don't die. Don't... die! Don't... die.
Ben kelev. - That's enough. Let's go.
McGee. - The director just left in the ambulance.
he's okay, but Mrs. Vance was hit.
not sure how bad.
what about my father?
no.
Abba! Abba...!
who did this?
any word on Mrs. Vance?
still in surgery.
it's been two hours.
he hasn't moved.
he hasn't answered his phone, either.
SECNAV's started calling me.
did you answer?
no. I didn't know what to tell him.
he wasn't supposed to know Eli David was in town.
no one was.
you know, if the wrong people found out what happened, this could be taken as a declaration of war.
maybe that's what it is.
Israel-Iran.
u. S.-Iran. U. S.-Israel.
we came as soon as we heard.
let's wait in the lobby.
good idea.
she's dead.
my wife is dead, Gibbs.
TBC...
so after a three-year absence, it appears the slasher has returned with a vengeance, claiming two more young women in the last week.
I helped Abby add a third dead bolt to her apartment door last night.
if you've seen this man, you're asked to call the police tip line at 202-555...
I can't watch any more of this.
do not approach him, do not...
how was the fishing trip?
didn't go.
what?
you look forward to that every year.
Yeah.
just didn't feel like it, I guess.
something wrong?
I'm worried about Cameron.
I don't know, since he got out of the Navy, he hasn't found work; he's very depressed.
Ah, he's a kid, Frankie; he'll figure it out.
Yeah.
he's been acting really strange, too.
you talk to him?
Well...his mother had a way of getting through to him.
I don't.
you did a great job raising him after she died.
what's the problem?
you saw the police sketch of the Dead Rose Slasher.
it looks just like Cameron.
it looks like a lot of guys, Frank.
it's not just that.
the murders started four years ago, when Cameron was a student at Hamilton.
the first victim was a coed there, and then they stopped for three years, when he was away in the Navy.
but now they've started again since he's come back home.
it's probably just a coincidence.
I thought you didn't believe in coincidences, Gibbs.
do you remember when he left college middle of his sophomore year?
Yeah, he got hurt. Lost his scholarship.
the best left-handed quarterback to come out of the DC high schools.
I was too ashamed to tell you the truth.
cameron was accused of date rape.
now, eventually all the charges were dropped, but...
he was thrown out.
long time ago, Frank.
cameron wasn't at home the nights of the last two killings.
what do I do, Gibbs?
I mean, I can't go to the police and say I suspect my own son.
Well...maybe I can give you a little peace of mind
ask around, get Metro PD to give me something that eliminates Cameron as a suspect.
can you do it without giving up his name?
because if I'm wrong, and he finds out, it'll be the end of what's ever left of our relationship.
thank you for letting me borrow your controller, Tim.
you were right-- the yaw sensitivity is outstanding.
it anticipates your moves. I was up half the night playing.
playing? Instead of studying?
studying?
Yeah, Dorneget, for your GS-11 exam.
what is that?
it's a test that probies used to have to take to become journeyman agents.
it hasn't been given in years. Gibbs is the last agent I know that took it.
the word is that Director Vance is reinstating that test.
you're messing with me. - No, he is not.
I heard the same thing from Hollander in HR.
I'm glad I did not have to take it.
well, what kind of test is it?
whew, it's tough.
comprehensive, covers all the rules and then regs, procedures-- it's all in the manuals, which you're gonna have to... know by heart.
here comes Vance. You can ask him yourself.
where is he? - It's Haircut Tuesday, Director Vance.
Yeah, the bowl should be coming off his head just about now.
he should be here any second.
got something on your mind, Dorneget?
no, sir.
tell Gibbs I need to see him.
Abby, did you get the security video I sent you?
check your e-mail, McGee.
how's Director Vance been today?
he seems, um, fine.
I'm worried about him.
what's this?
lance Corporal Douglas Alexander and a mystery passenger leaving the base at Norfolk three days ago.
he stole over 120 grand from the cash sales office he was assigned to.
this is the last time he was seen leaving the base.
we have not been able to find him. We put out a BOLO and nothing.
well, he shouldn't be too hard to spot. He's 220, six-five.
well, I removed the reflection and then I enhanced the passenger's face.
look at that. An attractive woman.
I ran the image through facial recognition, and I got a name.
what is it?
Melissa Tourney. She's a civilian.
we find her, we'll find him.
nice haircut, Agent Gibbs.
I'm gonna go back to the evidence locker.
uh, boss, Vance is looking for you.
he went back to his office.
strange.
detective, you I. D.'d the girl?
uh, yeah, but we're not releasing the name yet.
you'll give me an exclusive? - Come on, Bart.
the chief's having a press conference this afternoon.
you'll find out when everybody else does.
detective Shard?
special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.
NCIS? How can I help you?
well, we're investigating an attempted homicide.
got a witness... described a guy looks a lot like the sketch of your Dead Rose Slasher.
yeah? And you think we're looking for the same person?
I don't know. What's the sketch based on?
witness saw a guy running from the scene of Victim Number Two's murder three years ago.
what makes you think the same guy's killing again?
everything. Girls all fit a profile.
same type of weapon. Bodies posed the same way.
the guy leaves a... dead rose on the victim's chest.
you got a fingerprint? You got any DNA?
that would make it too easy.
this guy's real careful. Must be wearing gloves.
how about yours?
you got anything that can eliminate my suspect?
stab wounds suggest that he's left-handed.
your guy left-handed?
you know... I'll check. Not sure.
Melissa Tourney, 28, is a professional dancer.
works under the name of Misty Blue.
sounds like a stripper.
is a stripper. At a club in Anacostia.
I just caught the lunch show. It's pretty good.
comes with a couple of ginger ales and a bacon double cheeseburger.
just following the lead, boss.
spoke with a couple of the girls.
one of them told me that Melissa met our lance corporal a couple weeks ago.
they've been hot and heavy ever since.
she hasn't shown up for work the past three nights.
while he was busy talking to the other girls,
I went to Melissa Tourney's apartment.
the landlady said she packed up and left yesterday.
did not leave a forwarding address.
but we're pretty sure we know where she is now.
she bought a ticket. Paid cash.
reagan National to Charlotte with a connecting flight to Freeport, Grand Bahamas.
left the country, traveling alone?
looks that way.
she booked herself into a resort on the east end of the island.
lance Corporal Alexander'll show up.
certainly worth a trip down there.
you volunteering for that, are you, DiNozzo?
stripper, Caribbean beach-- is that a trick question?
behave yourself, Skippy.
aye, aye, sir.
you're not sending him alone.
no.
Hey, spring Dorneget out of the evidence locker, will you?
Dorneget? - Yeah.
I need you and Ziva here. - Don't worry, Tim, I'll bring you back a T-shirt.
Hey, Duck. Just a second.
since the weather broke, I-I've been running at lunchtime. Part of my cardio-rehab.
managed to lower my resting heart rate by almost 20% since my little episode last year.
Hey, I need a favor.
you still tight with the City M. E?
Tom Hubbard? Yes, we play bridge every Wednesday.
he was a little upset the other night when I trumped his ace, but, uh, when we won the rubber, he forgave me.
Well...he did all the autopsies on the Dead Rose Slasher victims.
yeah? And I'm wondering if he found anything that could eliminate someone as a suspect.
I don't want Metro PD to know who's asking.
so y-you want me to con the information out of him?
may I ask why?
helping a friend.
okay.
Hey, you hear I'm going to the Bahamas?
Yeah. - Yeah, - with, uh, Tony. - Yeah.
I got to get back to my place, pack and set my DVR.
he's picking me up in an hour. - Listen, don't let him "probie" you.
what? - I've been there, Dorney.
Tony's gonna pull rank.
I can handle him.
watch your back, Dorney.
cameron Dean's life started falling apart after high school.
in his second year of college, a sorority girl accused him of date rape, but charges were eventually dropped.
he left college and enlisted in the Navy.
McGee: He was overseas for nearly three years, but he got discharged, is now in the Reserves.
seems to have straightened out but is, um, currently livingat home with his father, collecting unemployment.
any criminal record?
no.
can you... tell us why we're looking at him?
his father's an old friend of mine, and he is worried that his son might be the Dead Rose Slasher.
sure looks like the sketch.
not our case.
and I don't want to give him over to the police unless this is something more than a father's paranoia.
so... if you don't want to help on this...
I get it.
whatever you need, Gibbs.
if you can get his cell phone number, we can locate him and discreetly check him out.
thank you.
Hey, Leon.
you mind some company?
I have an hour left with the babysitter.
yeah? Where'd you go?
supposedly group bereavement counseling.
couldn't do it, so...
I'm consoling myself with some double chocolate brownies.
would you care to join me? I hate to eat alone.
how you doing?
I'll be fine. Just need some space.
I don't need people smothering me with...
sympathy, poor-him, puppy-dog looks.
you talking about Abby?
Yeah, she means well.
I know. - Abby's got a big heart, Leon.
she's just trying to help you any way she can.
and I appreciate the brownie.
why are you really here?
I'm back on the job, Gibbs.
I don't like being out of the loop.
chief of Metro Detectives called asking me:
why are you sticking your nose in the Dead Rose Slasher case?
said you were at the crime scene, Dr. Mallard questioned his M. E.
Nah, it's nothing official, Leon.
I was just checking something out for a friend.
well, must be a good friend.
Yeah, he's been there for me.
all right.
have you ever had the burger here?
uh, sorry, no.
do you live in the neighborhood?
excuse me?
I'm just visiting, and, um...
this menu does nothing for me.
would you be able to recommend anything else around here?
no, not... not really.
I'm Abby.
Hey, Abby.
I'd really love to stay and chat, but I have to go.
Yeah, sure. - Some other time.
we better follow him.
Yeah, she fits the profile of all the other victims-- come on. Let's go.
Ah, look at that. You're too much. Thank you.
you're supposed to beat the senior field agent to work.
I'm so sorry, but the front desk called me at, like, 3:00 a. m.
Why?
they said I ordered a wake-up call. Can you believe that?
it took me forever to get back to sleep, and then I guess I slept in.
I-I-I'm... I'm sorry, Agent DiNozzo,
I promise it won't happen again.
it's "Tony" when we're on stakeout. The idea is we're supposed to blend in.
right.
speaking of which, what in the name of Brooks Brothers are you wearing?
you look like exactly what you are:
a pubescent federal agent.
now, while you were sleeping,
I was already on the job.
Melissa Tourney left the Royal Suite this morning, all alone.
where is she now?
if you can be discreet, she's the blonde in the bikini with the smoking-hot body by the waterfall, over your left shoulder.
left shoulder.
stop it. Oh, my God, stop.
we're gonna have to work on that.
she's the kind of gal my father would say you want to make cookies with.
so, do we just wait around for Lance Corporal Alexander to show?
Yeah, that's exactly what we do.
and we hope it takes him a couple days to show, so we can enjoy this little slice of paradise.
why don't you go find something beachy to wear? Hit the gift shop. I'm gonna call the office.
okay.
get some sunblock.
how is Dorneget doing?
he's an easier mark than McGee.
I pulled the old 3: 00 a. m. wake-up on him.
course you did.
give him a break, Tony.
Hey, McGander.
check this out.
you see anything like that on the Metrorail this morning?
Hi, ladies.
Wow. Looking good. Looking very good.
I like the purple.
you make an arrest already, did you, DiNozzo?
boss, uh...
no, well, I,uh...
you find Cameron Dean last night?
traced his cell to a bar near Union Station.
he was alone.
I tried making conversation with him, but he was distracted by a younger woman.
he could not take his eyes off her.
brunette, mid-20s. Fits the profile of the slasher victims.
after she left the bar, he followed her.
we tailed him, a couple of blocks to an apartment building.
nothing happened.
he never approached her, and left after she went inside.
Where'd he go after that? - Back to his father's house.
lights went off in his room at 1: 00 a. m.His father's a barber.
boss, he wouldn't happen to be yours...
guys, later, okay? Later.
Gibbs. What are you doing here?
you weren't very forthcoming.
thought I'd check in with Director Vance.
he assures me NCIS will share information that's pertinent to my investigation.
we will.
so, give me the name of your suspect.
Vance claims, uh, he doesn't know it.
it is premature.
all we have now is someone with a passing resemblance to your sketch.
I'd like to talk to him.
what's the harm?
is there anything other than left-handed that would eliminate or incriminate my guy?
so your guy is left-handed.
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
you have a moment?
I'll be right there.
I gotta go.
we'll be in touch.
so, what do you do here?
I'm Special Agent David.
you've been to Israel.
Yeah. I was born there.
shalom.
I spoke with Dr. Hubbard.
Yeah, I know you did.
uh, he reported your conversation to the Chief of Detectives, who called Director Vance.
and I thought I was so circumspect.
doc, don't worry about it.
chief complained about me, too.
hubbard tell you anything?
Yeah, that, uh... two recent murders are identical to those three years ago.
based on the stab wounds, the killer is most definitely left-handed.
and the same type and size of blade was used in all cases.
the killer leave any forensic evidence?
none.
but Hubbard did reveal something interesting.
besides being in the same physical phylum, all of the young ladies were intravenous drug users.
detective Shard didn't mention that.
I thought he was holding something back.
that's funny you should say that.
hubbard has a tell when we play cards.
a little twitch when he's hiding a good hand.
last night, the old boy was twitching like a worm on a hook.
there's something they're not telling us.
Thanks.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I hate the Bahamas.
I hate the Bahamas.
Hey, Tony! Tony!
here's your burger.
what took you so long?
I had to wait in line.
there's mustard all over this thing. I hate mustard.
then scrape it off.
take the burger back.
no way. I am not your personal assistant, Tony
are you getting feisty with me?
McGee warned me you'd play the probie card.
I... read the regs.
a senior agent cannot order a probationary agent to perform personal services.
you brought your manuals with you.
I have to study for my GS-11.
well, take this back before I slap you silly.
she's staring at us.
she's staring at me.
she has been for the last hour.
Why?
maybe it's time I made contact.
should you do that?
she'll think it's weird if I don't.
watch and learn.
couldn't help notice you're sitting here all alone.
I thought maybe you'd want some company?
sure.
your partner won't mind?
"partner"?
Oh, I assumed you two were a couple.
just your shirt...it's so pink.
it's the third time the Dead Rose Slasher has struck the downtown area in the last two weeks.
the latest victim was killed early this morning, her body found in an alley across the street from this hotel, which is known to be frequented by drug users and prostitutes.
got my fingers crossed it's not the girl we saw from the bar last night.
she did not look like a drug addict.
her name's being withheld pending notification of next of kin, but I've been told told she resembles the other Dead Rose Slasher victims.
any idea where your guy was last night?
I'm sure Detective Shard is gonna ask me the same thing. That's him calling me right now.
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
this is a courtesy call, Gibbs, to let you know that I'm picking up Cameron Dean for questioning.
how'd you get his name?
a little talent I acquired.
I can read upside down.
I saw his picture and his name on that cute agent's desk.
we'll keep in touch.
shard has Cameron Dean's name.
how did he get it?
Ziva, find the woman he was following and make sure she's still alive.
McGee, get Cameron Dean in here before Metro finds him.
I'll call the Metro chief and the commissioner and run interference.
don't look like have good news.
I want to ask you something, Frank.
was Cameron home this morning?
he was gone when I got up.
why, you think he killed that girl they found in the alley?
no.
but the police are gonna call him in for questioning.
what happened? Why?
did they have evidence that points to Cameron?
no. They learned we were checking him out.
how?
I'm gonna do everything I can, okay? - Well, what happened?
did you give him up to the cops? - No.
no. We got careless.
I should have never said anything to you.
no, you did the right thing.
what happened to my son?
special Agent Gibbs.
are you gonna be the one to tell me what the hell's going on here?
cause no one else will.
where were you just before dawn this morning?
I was looking for work.
what time did you leave your house?
about a quarter to 6: 00.
there was a construction company that was hiring day laborers.
it's a first come, first serve kind of thing.
I didn't get it.
why were you following her last night?
what the hell is this all about?
do you think that I'm the serial killer?
why were you following her?
I was doing a favor for a shipmate.
he's stationed in Bahrain.
this is his wife, and he thinks that she's cheating on him.
he asked me to do him a favor, so I followed her around to see what she was up to.
that's it.
I'm taking him into custody.
agent Gibbs is in the middle of an interrogation.
you have no jurisdiction in my case, Director Vance.
if your agents do anything to jeopardize our investigation or prosecution in this case, you'll face charges.
we have our own reasonings for questioning Mr. Dean.
you got a problem?
turn over the suspect.
we're holding him for 24 hours.
for what? - Stalking a Navy dependent.
this woman-- we checked; she's alive.
it doesn't mean that he didn't kill the woman we found this morning.
look at him!
he could've posed for the sketch.
I want access to your files on the serial killings.
Yeah, right.
you got big ones, Gibbs.
the point is moot, Detective Shard.
I talked to your chief. He told me how backed up your lab is.
I offered our assistance. He thought a fresh set of eyes might be helpful.
all the physical evidence is on its way over.
Hey, want some help with that?
Yeah, sure.
the Bronze Master.
is your friend checking up on you?
my friend.
Oh, he just got here.
I knew it was too good to be true.
well... see ya.
Bye.
Bye.
see ya. - See ya round.
what?
Hey, Melissa.
aren't you gonna introduce me?
who is this guy? - Just someone I met at the pool.
come on... I'm not just someone.
I'm NCIS, Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
what's going on? - I don't know.
please, stop...
get back here!
did I hear you say,"Please stop"?
come on.
come on, come on, come on.
you have a minute? Um...
sure, but I was just going down to the garage because the Dead Rose Slasher evidence just came in from Metro.
I'll ride down with you. We can talk along the way.
did I do something wrong?
no. Quite the contrary.
I need your help.
look, I know you're busy, but, uh, when you have time, I'd like to ask a favor.
Oh, sure.
I mean, anything. What?
Kayla needs help with her science project.
it is not my strong suit.
science project?
Yes.
it's only, like, my favorite thing.
totally got me through middle school.
I... I would love to. I can't wait.
thank you. Would you, uh, do me a favor and make sure that - Kayla does some of the work? - Got it.
how, um...?
how is she?
she's okay.
I, uh... I think she could benefit from having a strong adult woman in her life right now.
director Vance?
would you mind if I gave you a hug?
I wouldn't mind at all.
great us finally getting to work together, huh?
I know! Director Vance, this is Metro PD's forensics' specialist, Ramsey Boone.
Ah, Director Vance.
must be a pretty friendly agency. You get to hug the boss, huh?
special circumstances. Glad to meet you, Ramsey.
Ramsey and I go way back.
Yeah, we met at criminal college.
we were roommates. - Junior and senior year.
and he graduated Summa Cum Laude.
right, just behind Abby, who was first in her class.
I got it. Ramsey, thanks for your help on this, but I got to get going.
I got kids to feed.
looks like we got a lot of evidence to get through, huh?
Yeah.
all-nighter!
cameron Dean's buddy in Bahrain confirmed his story.
he did ask Dean to check up on his wife.
good. And I just spoke to the construction company.
cameron Dean's name was on the wait list yesterday morning.
sounds like he's in the clear.
uh, they're back.
the Double D's-- DiNozzo and Dorneget-- got their man.
when do I get my lawyer?
relax, big guy.
what happened?
Oh, um, nothing...
he got punched in the head. Rookie mistake.
take him to lockup, Dorney.
okay, come on.
so, where's the stripper?
detained by Bahamian authorities, awaiting extradition.
did you recover the money?
most of it, and I got this for you.
extra small.
it's good to be back.
you must be Gibbs, yeah. Abby described your haircut, like, perfectly.
uh, she sounded excited on the phone.
Yeah. - Abby!
where is she?
she...
was brushing her teeth.
can a body really absorb any more caffeine?
what have you got?
well, the Gibb's gut was right. Detective Shard was not sharing everything.
you'll love this. It's really creepy.
the slasher left a plain, silver wedding band hidden in the mouths of each one of his victims.
Yeah, and only three people knew.
there was Doc Hubbard, the medical examiner who found them.
and Detective Shard, who was in charge of the investigation.
and me. - Ramsey was sworn to secrecy, but...
Yeah, but the chief told me to share everything with you.
now, the rings are the reason that we know that the recent murders and the ones from three years ago were committed by the same person.
that's it?
no.
well, we also found the killer's DNA.
Where'd you get it?
no, not me-- no, Abby found it. She's a genius.
Oh, no, no, it was absolutely teamwork-- we did it together.
what? No. I've had the evidence, like, three years. I never found anything.
Yeah, you would have. I mean, I just got lucky...
Where'd you get it?!
Oh, um, well, I found a teensy weensy bit of blood on the thorn from the rose left on Victim Number Two.
Yeah, the killer must have pricked his finger.
I don't know. How did I miss it?
the great news is-- it is not Cameron Dean's blood.
whose is it?
well, we ran the DNA. - And we got a hit.
meet Leo Winkler.
Yeah, he looks like the sketch.
it's a dead ringer.
Yeah, but don't get too excited, Gibbs,'cause he's a dead ringer, like, dead ringer, like, really, really dead ringer.
Yeah, Winkler died shortly after the killings stopped three years ago.
so, he didn't commit the most recent murders. Who did?
copycat. - Copycat.
let me get this straight: While Dorney and I were away, you guys got involved in the Dead Rose Slasher case?
Yup. - No way! I'm obsessed with that case.
I DVR'd all the local news coverage while we were gone, so I could keep up.
well, we solved the first three murders.
Abby and her boyfriend did. - Ramsey is not her boyfriend.
who's Ramsey?
the killer's name was Leo Winkler.
he died in a bar fight three years ago.
he's a very tragic character.
medical records reveal Mr. Winkler was born to a drug-addicted woman whose name, curiously, was Rose, the flower he symbolically left on each young lady's corpse.
I mean, he was killing women like his unwed mother to prevent them from having children like himself.
but if he died three years ago, who's committing the recent murders?
the copycat. Who could not be Cameron Dean.
who's Cameron Dean?
Gibbs' barber's kid.
Gibbs' barber? - Thank God.
cameron's finally in the clear.
his only crime was looking like the sketch and being left-handed.
there's no way he could've known about the wedding bands.
are you following any of this?
almost...
on second thought, why don't you just go back to the evidence locker?
thank you.
I love that kid.
want a ride?
no. What I want to know is why I was being suspected and followed.
someone thought you looked like the police sketch.
who?
you thought I was the serial killer?
in my heart, I knew you weren't, son.
you know what? I'm gonna take the stairs.
cameron, wait up.
look, put yourself in his place, all right?
there are a bunch of things from your past.
and then he sees the sketch.
my father's never believed me. He has no idea who I am.
don't cut him out of your life. You only get one father.
talk to him.
the fact the killer hid wedding bands in each of the victim's mouth was kept a secret.
we used it to discredit false confessions.
and you never considered a copycat?
no.
so only you, your M. E.
and a forensic scientist knew about the wedding band?
look, Tom Hubbard is nearly 80 years old and frail.
trust me, he is not your slasher.
and Ramsey Boone, our forensic tech? Weird.
but I seriously doubt he has it in him to harm anybody.
that leaves me.
I'll take a polygraph right now.
no one else had access?
no.
and the information wasn't on any electronic database?
what?
I, uh...
I gave a redacted summary to a TV reporter. - Who?
Why?
the case had gone cold and-and Crowley approached me about doing a news segment.
he'd been on this story since the beginning.
hell, he's the one who coined the name the Dead Rose Slasher.
I figured we'd get that sketch out there and reboot the investigation.
you got a copy of what you gave him?
yeah... somewhere.
shard blacked-out 15 mentions of the wedding band, but...
he missed one reference.
Crowley could have found it.
in the three-year period the serial killings stopped, Crowley's career suffered.
he never got another major story.
rumor is, he was going to be let go.
then the Dead Rose Slasher returns, and he's back with the lead story on the news.
you think he became the copycat to resurrect his career?
you find out where Crowley is now, and where he was yesterday morning.
I talked to Kayla last night.
she's chosen a project about the effects of global warming in the Chesapeake Bay.
I really appreciate this.
and I have already pulled temperature and tide charts for a 30-year period.
how's the eye, Dorneget?
uh, it-it's fine, sir.
why are you highlighting those old manuals?
I'm preparing for my GS-11 exam.
we haven't given that test in over 20 years.
but I heard you were reinstating it.
from whom?
agent DiNozzo.
Dorneget, you're being probied.
Yeah, but Ziva confirmed it.
that's 'cause he did the same thing to her, and she studied for three months.
Dorneget, let's teach Agent DiNozzo a lesson.
look at what I found.
Where's DiNozzo?
this was taken an hour before the last victim's body was found.
and this is Bart Crowley's car.
it was parked two blocks away from yesterday's crime scene.
while Ziva was reviewing security camera footage in the neighborhood, I tracked Crowley's cell phone.
it was turned off at 4: 23 a. m.and back on at 5: 30.
you suspect Crowley? - Yes.
matches estimated time of death.
the schmuck should have left his cell at home, turned on.
you got enough for search warrants?
if it means anything, Bart Crowley is left-handed.
I watched all of his reports last night.
he holds the microphone with his left and wears a watch on the right.
okay. Thank you, guys.
police have identified the latest slasher victim as a Jessica Ann Jackson, a 26-year-old waitress.
family members I spoke with said they'd lost contact with Jessica in the last couple years.
neighbors I... I spoke with...
um, hold-hold it for a second, Chris.
what's up?
we got a break in the case, Bart.
great. - Thanks to NCIS.
we got DNA that ties a suspect to Victim Number Two.
you make an arrest? - No. No.
can't do that. That guy died three years ago.
h-how do you explain all the recent killings?
copycat.
I didn't see that coming.
we got a pretty good idea who it might be.
just executed a search warrant on the apartment.
found a few interesting items in the bedroom drawer.
two dead, long-stemmed roses, several silver wedding bands, and the coup de grace-- a six-inch knife.
I'm betting we find traces of the victims' blood on the blade.
and your camera crew's been shooting all this.
why don't you turn around?
come on, turn around.
your arrest is gonna make excellent footage on tonight's news.
morning, Timmy.
Dorney, did you get a little hall pass to come play with the grownups?
look at you.
all grown up, wearing a suit.
what have we here?
no idea.
red envelope.
Oh, it's just my expense report.
I just handed this in.
the Bahamas-- we had some fun down there.
didn't we? Look at that. A little note signed by the director. What's he saying?
it's been rejected?
I'm being audited for the past two years?
what is this?
that's too bad.
No!
no, no, no!
is this your doing?
have a nice day, Frank.
Hey, Dad.
Nope.
Nope, I'm just checking in.
no kiss for your father?
what are you doing here?
Arash Kazmi is Eli's new VIVAC contemporary.
iranian intelligence.
Abba! - Leon?
she's dead. My wife is dead, Gibbs.
where is Ziva David?
you are? - Ilan Bodnar.
Mossad Deputy Director.
I have known Ilan since we were children.
he always fancied himself a... a son to Eli, a part of my family, which he is not.
you lied to me about the real reason for Eli's visit.
tricked by that dog Kazmi to believe in some ridiculous pipe dream of peace between our countries.
I'll be home soon.
in Hebrew, the word is tohar.
connection?
a man's middle name.
Whose? - Ilan Bodnar.
Bodnar's in the wind.
McGee says his hotel room is scrubbed clean.
he could be anywhere.
Noah. I'm home.
are you going in late today?
slept about three minutes.
I was sitting next to one of those open-mouth snorers.
a grizzly bear with a cold would have been quieter.
Oh, speaking of which, I may have to go to Alaska in the fall for work.
honey 911 Operator. Please state your emergency.
Callie. - Hello?
Ben... What are you...?
What...? Where's Noah?
I saw the back door open early this morning.
I called several times to tell Noah to close it.
when I never heard back, I decided... - Ben... where is my husband?
I looked everywhere, Callie.
he's gone.
do you mind?
it's 8: 05.
Yes, I can tell time just fine, Tony. Thank you.
then you know Ziva's late.
by five minutes.
something's definitely up.
you haven't noticed she's been a little off these past few days?
Oh, she's been off? That's a good one.
think about it.
personal phone calls to Shmeil at all hours.
yesterday, she came back from lunch smelling like Thai food and beer.
so she stopped for take-out.
Ziva hates Thai food.
and she drinks on the job about as often as she gets my movie references.
open your eyes, McHelen Keller. Something's going on.
okay, I get it. You're nosy.
you can't help it.
it's called being a good citizen.
no, it's called borderline stalking.
what's next, a Ziva-cam?
maybe. Let's put a pin in that.
Tony, stop.
please stop, and please, for the love of God, put that pen down before I stab you with it.
sorry. Look...
and his killer is still out there.
what, Bodnar?
that's CIA now.
you think Ziva would go after him on her own?
I think Crying Tiger Beef has entered the building.
how are you? - What did you call me?
huh? N-Nothing. I didn't call you anything.
where you been?
I had to take care of some things this morning.
anything you'd like to share?
no time to share.
time to move, ladies.
naval officer's husband has gone missing.
come on, let's go.
quick word, Gibbs.
homeland's called twice.
Ziva? - Yeah.
word is, she's been sniffing around.
I got a pretty good idea why.
well, she's not the only one.
you're looking around, too.
no, not yet, but if and when I do, you'll be the first to know.
teams waiting
husband's name is Noah Daniels, 37. Works as a realtor in Fairfax County.
any sign of forced entry?
Oh, not according to the police.
his wallet, watch and cell phone were found in the house.
that the wife?
navy Reserve Lieutenant Callie Daniels.
paramedics are evaluating her for possible shock.
well, let me know when they're done.
it's gonna take a while to process everything. This place is a total mess.
he went down with a fight.
well, blood trail leads through the kitchen. I'm gonna start in there next.
anything around the perimeter?
nothing so far.
but police are still searching.
looks like a happy couple.
so, uh, tell me about this car again.
uh, older model light sedan, maybe a Chevy.
tinted windows.
first saw it idling in front of Noah's house around 2: 00 this morning.
did you see the driver? Plates?
Nah, too dark.
so then what happened?
then I tried to go back to sleep, heard a door slam, got up and saw that same car tearing off.
when I noticed Noah's door open this morning, I got a bad feeling.
poor Callie.
the look on her face.
lieutenant Daniels. I'm Agent David with NCIS.
you have been cleared to talk to us... if that's okay.
is this really happening?
please tell me this isn't really happening.
blood trail stops at the door.
rest of the kitchen looks untouched.
no signs of a struggle, no blood anywhere else.
wait a second.
should I open it?
that's yes.
what, McGee?
Where's the rest of him?
looks like it was severed at the flexor tendon.
would have been extensive bleeding.
definitely an injury you'd want to seek immediate medical attention for.
so, I-I went ahead and took a tissue sample.
Abby's testing it now.
all right. Very good, Mr. Palmer.
you know, this is great.
I mean, the two of us just sitting here working.
you over there doing your thing, me over here doing my thing.
I mean, it's like-like we're the best tag team ever, right?
you want to tag in? Huh?
you want to...?
okay. You're-you're busy.
you're... Based on the size and shape of this fingertip,
I would say it came from either the third or fourth digit.
vena amoris.
actually, I was thinking, uh, the ring finger.
as am I.
the Romans believed that one should wear the wedding ring on the fourth finger of the left hand
yes-- because a vein in that finger runs straight through to the heart.
vena amoris.
Literally,"the vein of love."
Ah, so maybe the wife...
that has to be left up to Agent Gibbs and the others to decipher.
my task is a psychological profile.
and gathering all this has taken most of my time this morning.
say no more.
let me clean up over here, and I will jump right in.
no, no. That won't be necessary.
I just need some peace and quiet.
and this work is still a bit out of your reach.
so...
okay. Um... I-I will just leave you to it.
no. You know what? I take it back. It is not okay.
look, I appreciate you throwing me a bone once in a while
or in this case, a finger-- but it's not enough.
I want to step up in all aspects of my career.
and I will not let you send me on my way because you think something is-is, what, beyond my reach?
it's not beyond my reach.
I can help. I want to help. I want you to teach me... that.
are you through?
I believe so, yes.
then pull up a stool.
a man's life hangs in the balance.
we need to work fast.
boss, BOLO's out on Noah Daniels in a sedan.
you get anything?
no, nothing yet. The state and local police are on high alert.
and I'm still scouring traffic camera feeds in the Fairfax area.
hope this doesn't turn into one of those whacked-out games of tic-tac-toe.
you know, a finger here, an arm there.
you find a head, then you got a meat puzzle you gotta put...
Noah Daniels. Put it up.
he was born in Schenectady, New York, the only child of Martha and Samuel Daniels.
both deceased.
employed as a realtor.
trouble with the law?
no. Record's clean.
all I could find was a jaywalking ticket. That's about it.
money problems?
well, still searching bank records from his home state, but looks like everything's good.
he's got a credit score of 810.
mortgage payments up to date.
DiNozzo, tell me about Callie Daniels.
there's no debt on her end, either.
enlisted in 2005, served two tours before joining the Reserves.
her unit's working on a classified case, so, unable to access files.
C. O. confirmed that's why she was in San Diego the past three days.
no kids, married ten years.
ten years.
just enough time to really start hating each other.
my money's on the wife, boss.
well, think I got something.
it's off a traffic camera, 8 blocks from the Daniels' house.
terrified captive look and all.
what's the time, McGee? - 2: 15 a. m.
that's right after the neighbor saw the car fleeing the scene.
keep with it.
check with homeowners and the residents in the area.
see if anybody's seen that car in the last eight hours.
it's about time Gibbs.
we got to hop to it.
strange things are brewing.
mercury's in retrograde, just so you know.
who knows what kind of mayhem is gonna pop up after the sun goes down.
so, chop-chop. Over here.
but this is what we know so far:
since most of the destruction was contained in the family room, it's clear that Noah Daniels' abductor didn't violently enter... the house.
that's a countertop, Gibbs.
um, and there's no evidence of a chase.
knew the person. Talked to him.
judging from the blood on the couch, I'm betting that the finger was cut here.
and the tissue from the finger is a DNA match to the blood in the house, so...
it definitely belongs to-- or, I guess, it used to belong to Noah Daniels.
no weapon found at the scene.
no, and there's no prints either.
except for ones that match Lieutenant Daniels and her husband, but that makes total sense because it is their house.
we could be dealing with a pro.
and, he may have more than a few special skills.
you have a finger that's severed right at the joint.
the wound is uniform.
there's no rough edges.
it's almost... - Surgical.
Yeah.
our suspect has trauma training.
he knows how to detach a finger cleanly.
but lucky for us, he left something more than a finger.
you got a second blood type.
and it's not from the lieutenant or her husband.
find a match, we find our suspect.
hopefully before sundown.
mayhem, Gibbs. Mayhem.
you saw him.
so he's okay?
we believe he's alive, yes.
then where is he?
who took him?
we're working as fast as we can.
well, work faster-- I need to know where my husband is.
you said earlier that you talked last night.
what time was that?
do we need to go through this again?
it's important we get all the facts.
fine.
it was around 7: 00 my time.
Noah was home.
he was getting ready for bed.
I... heard the news on.
Noah always plays on the computer and watches news before he goes to bed.
drives me crazy.
did he sound agitated, upset?
no.
no, he was fine.
none of this makes any sense.
was your husband ever involved in, um, illegal gambling? Drugs?
are you kidding?
Noah doesn't like anything that makes him feel like he's losing control.
he fight with anyone recently? There any threats?
not that I know of.
how about with the two of you? Any issues?
I love Noah.
and I just...
and when I walked into the house this morning I was tired.
I was bitching about stupid stuff.
ten seconds later, none of that mattered.
all that did was that my husband was gone.
gone.
I just want him back.
you reading Ziva's diary again?
she's trolling for news on Bodnar.
you know, you really need some kind of hobby.
like Boggle. - Or scrapbooking.
this is not good, McGee.
Tony, leave it alone.
I'm just saying, she's hopped on the rogue train before.
bolo status. Now.
uh, well, no news is bad news, boss.
trail's stone-cold on the sedan.
and no recent attempts to call Lieutenant Daniels' cell phone, but we do have something else.
bank records in the victim's home state turned up a trust account.
his father made a killing in the construction business.
left the bulk of his fortune to his son when he died last year.
that's more than two million dollars.
if this lunatic is after Noah's inheritance, he'll never get it.
why is that?
his father worked hard his whole life.
Noah would rather die than give it up.
you a signee on the account?
that's what his father wanted.
could be the kidnapper.
put it up.
keep him on the line as long as you can.
hello.
Oh, my God, Noah.
are you all right?
Wh-where are you?
I'm not sure. It's dark in here.
I miss you so much. - I miss you, too.
I'm gonna get you home.
you just need to hold on, okay?
I'll try... - Shut up!
- No, Callie, it's a trap!
Noah. What's going on?
tell me you got that.
1673 North Chesapeake Center Drive.
just off Route 123.
DiNozzo, let's go.
Ziva, stay with her.
please find him.
federal agents! Step out of the car.
NCIS! Let me see your hands.
lots of blood, boss.
he's gone.
Yeah.
Hey, boss. No bullets or shell casings found in the car.
could've been shot somewhere else.
you think this just became a recovery situation?
maybe. - So how do we tell the wife?
we don't. Not till we have a body.
car's registered to a Landers Orton from Roanoke, Virginia.
what kind of name is Landers?
it's like I said.
y-you got the wrong guy.
I didn't kidnap nobody.
it's your car, Mr. Orton.
victim's blood was found inside.
name's Noah Daniels.
take another look and tell us where he is.
I said I don't know.
I never seen this guy before in my life. - Where is he?
please, I don't know anything.
we're done.
lock him up.
I think my brother might be involved, all right?
my kid brother, Darrell.
keep going.
I... I lent him my car a few days ago.
said he had a job interview out in Fairfax.
but when he didn't come back, I knew something was up.
you talk to him since?
no. Not a word.
but he... I think he took my debit card, too.
see, this is why I'm so glad I don't have siblings.
Darryl might've screwed up before, but he is not capable of what you guys are saying.
he's a good kid.
he-he's just kind of... lost is all.
He-he... All he wants is to... clean up and stay out of the big house.
you served time?
just released six months ago.
I don't recognize him.
and you're sure your husband didn't know him?
I'm not exactly sure of anything right now.
I want to know how the hell this happened.
you had him, Agent Gibbs.
I heard my husband's voice on the phone.
he was this close, and you just let him get away.
doing our best, Lieutenant.
your best isn't good enough. Not for me.
look, I'm sorry.
I know you're all working hard, but I don't know how much more of this I can take.
we need to find this bastard.
background, let's go.
Darryl Orton, 25.
raised in southwest Virginia, dropped out of high school his sophomore year.
in and out of jail ever since.
graduated from shoplifting to the rough stuff in no time.
last conviction was assault with a deadly weapon in May 2011.
brother. Debit card activity.
uh, nothing since this morning, but I did find multiple charges to a Casita Rebecca's restaurant over the last week.
and, boss, Noah Daniels has been there more than a few times himself.
time stamps on the receipts show that they were both there two days ago.
means our victim was targeted.
get Ziva. Go.
we're just starting to put it together here.
lieutenant Daniels needs her husband, and we need answers.
in the meantime, I'll keep the FBI in the loop.
they've set up a tip line.
they're putting a freeze on Daniels' trust account.
I'll let you know what they find.
do not worry Kelly.
we will find him.
things have been bad... between Noah and me.
and, um... and I think I fell out of love with him.
then this morning realizing that he was gone.
I know it sounds crazy, but...
I know i still loves him
knowing he's hurt.
lieutenant... - And what am I doing?
nothing.
I'm just sitting here waiting for you guys to try and get him back.
it is hard to let others take over.
well, I'm not that girl. I don't let others take over.
I fight for what I want.
your husband is still out there.
your coworkers don't think so.
I saw the looks on their faces earlier.
they think he's dead, don't they?
and I know he's alive, Agent David.
I feel it in my bones.
her husband doesn't turn up alive grief's gonna be ten times worse.
hope is all she has, Tony.
a strong woman like that, it's got to be hard not to be in control.
she will persevere.
what choice does she have, right?
it's not about choice. It's about survival.
she will not stop until she gets her closure.
we still talking about the lieutenant?
please do not go there.
I'm fine.
I think that's her.
agents David and Dinozzo from NCIS.
we called.
this man, Noah Daniels, he's missing.
we know he was here a few days ago.
did you see him?
he's missing? I just... I saw him last week.
he comes in here every day for lunch.
really nice guy.
never give you any problems?
mostly keeps to himself.
a few of my waiters have become friends with him.
told them that he came into some money recently.
we also know he is a customer of yours.
do you recognize him?
wish I didn't.
Darryl Orton.
horrible temper.
I've had to call the cops on him a few times, after fights that he's picked.
do you know if Mr. Orton ever approached Mr. Daniels?
he did get into his face a few days ago.
said he heard about the money.
did Orton say anything else to him?
I have to take this. Excuse me.
sorry.
like I said, he was drinking a lot...
the Duck keeping you up late again, Palmer?
Oh, no. I asked to be here.
"Begged" is a more appropriate description.
well, I thought it was time that I... learned the psychological side.
Yeah, well, you're moving up in the world, Jim.
Yeah, well, right now, he's just moving.
do you mind?
anyone who abducts and mutilates his victims with such...
well, in such a violent manner, has no regard for human life.
which leads us to our suspect, Darryl Orton.
state records list him as a tortured soul.
born into poverty, third of nine children, to Glenda Jean Orton.
put up for adoption.
Yeah, and the case worker said that he was told his whole life that he was a total waste of space.
which leads to feelings of worthlessness and despair.
he thinks he doesn't deserve to be here.
as a result, he lives a life without fear.
death doesn't scare this guy. Not much does.
in other words, we feel you're headed for a violent showdown.
we track him down before he hurts somebody else.
the question is, though, where is he?
craves a sense of belonging. Wants a real family.
the one that he has is a total dysfunctional mess.
Yes, but we tend to run to what we know best.
I believe he'd still rather be near them than anywhere else.
the woods-- southwestern Virginia.
near his brother.
double shot of hazelnut?
can't believe you made me order this.
it's not even real coffee, you know.
highlight of my day, Leon.
let me have it.
summers a long time.
is Homeland treating you all right?
bureaucratic nightmare most days.
but I'm settled there.
doesn't mean I don't miss the director's chair at NCIS.
well, it misses you back.
we're not the only ones who know Agent David is hunting around.
CIA's aware, too.
and you don't?
if it were up to me, I'd give you his coordinates and tell you to have at it.
but it's not, so I can't.
saying you know where he is?
recent intel has him still in Rome.
hard though this seems, you're gonna have to trust that we'll take care of it.
I do.
tell Agent David to stay away.
it's the best thing for everybody.
search of the woods near Orton's childhood home was a bust.
no sign of him.
surveillance cams?
keeping an eye on everything from here to Roanoke.
local and state authorities are sending updates, too, but we're at a standstill.
it appears the calls to Lieutenant Daniels have stopped.
she safe at home?
Dorneget is standing by.
Orton could have disposed of Noah Daniels' body and fled the state.
what if we never find his body?
then we keep going until we do.
agent David's right.
it's the only way to build a solid case.
uh, boss, the trust account's been compromised.
money's gone.
that's not possible. The FBI froze it.
somebody hacked in.
and it looks like Orton opened an account this morning at a bank in Southern Virginia.
made a deposit for 37 grand.
so Orton wiped out the trust fund, and is spreading the money around?
sounds pretty complex for a high-school dropout.
Yeah. Too complex.
Gibbs! I was just about to call you.
I have big news.
no, huge.
about the way Noah Daniels was taken from the house?
how do you always know what I'm going to say before I say it?
gifted, Abbs. Gifted. Go.
okay, now, we know that this was a brutal fight.
I mean, brutal enough to knock over furniture, and send pictures flying.
and my guess is that Noah Daniels was kicking and screaming the whole way.
but take a look at this.
if he were kicking and screaming then these throw rugs would be pretty messed up, and there would be scuff marks all over the walls.
and yet...
the walls are clean, and the rugs were barely even moved.
there is nothing to indicate that Noah Daniels struggled on his way out the door.
probably because... - He passed out.
he had to be carried.
bingo.
but now for the huge part.
and I mean that literally.
Noah Daniels was six inches taller and 50 pounds heavier than Darryl Orton.
there is no way Orton carried him out of there on his own.
he had help.
Darryl Orton's brother has an alibi.
he was working a graveyard shift at a Roanoke pulp mill the last two nights.
supervisor confirms it.
as does security camera footage.
contact with anyone besides the brother this past week?
Orton's kept pretty much to himself since his release from prison.
no cell phone, no job, not even a pissed-off ex-girlfriend to contact.
restaurant owner ever see him come in with anybody?
no. Never.
Yes, I'll tell him. Thank you.
FBI just got a credible tip.
Orton?
person matching his description was just seen checking into the Stargazer Motel off I-66 an hour ago.
DiNozzo, Ziva, let's go.
NCIS. Open up!
he left something.
sorry to all I hurt.
he's dead I threw his body in the Potomac.
maybe we'll give Lieutenant Daniels closure after all.
the bullet entered here on his front lobe, but, uh, the exit wound is not consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot.
he never saw it coming.
no gunpowder residue on his hands, either.
this was not a suicide.
well, someone sure wanted to make it look like it was.
I might know who.
give me an update on Noah Daniels body.
well, state police are still dragging the river near the spot where Orton abandoned the car.
yeah? You got anything?
no. Not a finger or a toe.
not even a shred of clothing.
so I guess the note was meant to throw us off.
you catch up fast, McGee.
the local manager confirms only the cleaning crew accessed Orton's room before he checked in this morning.
surveillance videos?
security cameras have been down for repair all week.
sounds like Abby had a breakthrough.
Correct-- with "break" being the operative word.
or more specifically, what was not broken.
take a look at this, and tell me what you see.
blissful ignorance, rent-a-tux.
no cracks.
frame is not damaged.
lieutenant Daniels said that was on the wall above the couch.
right. There is no way that that landed on a hardwood floor without a scratch.
and there's more.
McGee, can you put up the file I sent you?
okay, so look at the position of the couch.
see how it's completely turned over on its side?
flipped over during the fight?
that's what I thought, too, but the couch has a solid oak frame.
it's impossible for it to end up like that by just being bumped into during a fight.
must have been placed that way.
Yeah, which means... - Crime scene was staged.
so, whoever staged Orton's death to look like a suicide...
went out of his way to make it look like Noah Daniels was in danger.
and that can only be one person.
call to the tip line-- McGee, who made it?
anonymous. Didn't leave their name, but I've got the recording.
you're sure you couldn't be mistaken.
no. I'm positive it was him.
where was this?
he was walking into the Stargazer Motel off I-66.
he had on a gray sweatshirt and jeans.
please, you have to send someone out there.
dispatching unit right away... - You don't have to yell.
I said I was leaving right now.
I just want to know how this happened.
you said nobody was going to get hurt.
you talking to your boyfriend?
that was business.
always is.
excuse me?
we know that this is your second restaurant to fall into debt in the past five years.
we also know Noah Daniels was helping bail you out.
we saw the flirty e-mails, we have the phone records.
Yes, he helped me.
but we were friends, that's it.
so, when did you and your friend decide to fake his disappearance?
correction, Ziva-- death.
the severed finger was a nice touch.
clean cut right at the knuckle.
who knew all that culinary school training would come in handy?
I'm a good person.
I would never... - Except you did.
and a man's dead because of it.
I had no part in that.
Noah, he's... he's lost control.
we were just supposed to get away.
we weren't supposed to deal with his wife, and... - Deal with a messy divorce?
and splitting the inheritance.
no. That money is Noah's.
his wife had no part in that trust.
is that what he told you?
he was lying. Big surprise.
I trusted him.
he kept telling me not to worry.
and that... everything was going to be okay, but everything happened so fast.
and then when I found out that Darryl was...
what's going to happen now?
what are you going to do to me?
well, you help us, maybe we can help you.
where is he?
looks pretty good for a dead guy, boss.
okay, I don't even know what that means.
get up.
get on your feet.
okay. Okay, no need to get rough about it.
I can explain everything.
explain it to your wife.
how could you?
do you have anything to say?
I can't believe you.
I'm done.
paperwork?
not exactly, boss.
go home. Case is closed.
I saw McGee leave; Ziva, too.
are you going to keep doing that?
doing what?
something on your mind, Dinozzo?
if Ziva was up to something, you'd want to know about it, wouldn't you?
I'd want to know she's safe.
but you'd want to respect her privacy.
unless she was in too deep.
Why? What is this about?
permission to look around, boss.
you worried about her?
then go find her, Dinozzo.
now.
Tony, it's unethical. Okay?
McGee pinged me last month, and I felt violated.
come on, Abby, you're all I've got.
I suck at this computer stuff, and your Wonder Twin is at his video game geek social tonight.
that's not till next week.
I need to find her.
I think it has something to do with Bodnar.
I knew it.
I knew that's what she was up to.
Oh, my God, Bodnar... that's really, really bad.
it's not like I'm surprised this is happening.
if I could set my clock to every time Mercury messes with somebody in my life, I'd...
Abby, just tell me you'll do it.
of course I'll do it.
I've got to be getting warm.
I passed four Thai restaurants and two bars on my way here.
not warm, Tony.
red hot.
now walk 20 feet due north.
I might be a little overdressed for this place.
okay... Okay, stop. Stop, stop, stop. You got it.
you're the best, Abbs.
I want to help.
is that food?
what are you doing here?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
now that the kidnapping case is over, we were going to tell you.
Ziva was just waiting for the right time.
things got out of hand, one phone call led to another, and then...
and the next thing you know we're holed up in this crummy studio, obsessing about where to go next.
well, I like what you've done with the place.
matching computers.
I mean, that's... that's adorable.
it's not funny.
this is serious.
I'm well aware of that, Ziva.
you're tracking a CIA target and using NCIS resources to do it.
no, this is all off the books.
Oh, good,'cause that makes it ten times worse.
hmm, it's a nice way to lose your job, guys.
it's only a matter of time before word gets out that you're tracking him internationally, if it isn't out already.
technically, we're not tracking him.
I have friends and contacts monitoring bank accounts and airport activity all around the world.
Shmeil putting in some overtime for you, huh?
Shmeil is one of my contacts, Tony.
but that is not what matters.
shortly after my father's death,
Bodnar was caught on a surveillance camera exiting a Dulles Airport parking garage.
25 minutes later, he was seen leaving a restroom inside the terminal.
a person matching his description landed at Rome's Fiumicino Airport the following day.
this is actually one of the last pictures taken of him, but there have been possible sightings in Switzerland and Prague as recently as last week.
we think he's exhausted all of his fail-safes and is still hiding out somewhere in western Europe.
or the CIA's already gotten to him, he's in custody or dead.
Bodnar's not dead.
he's alive.
and I'm not going to stop until I find him.
so, when do you plan on telling Gibbs?
what, Ziva?
I would like your permission to travel to Europe to find Bodnar.
I have been trying to locate him with the help of McGee and various contacts.
I know.
you have known all this time?
then why did you not...?
you needed to be ready to tell me.
he's in Rome.
that's what I thought, too.
what are you waiting for?
take Dinozzo. Go.
what do you need?
revenge.
I would like your permission to travel to Europe to find Bodnar.
what are you waiting for? Take DiNozzo.
Bodnar's on Ziva's laptop. Trace it like the wind.
I know you blame me for your father's death, Ziva.
is there anyone else to blame?
told you I would find you, Ilan.
is it over?
it's over.
Oh, I hate it when they cry. What'd you say to him?
I said it wasn't him; it was me.
that's original. - It's true.
me... didn't like him.
what was I supposed to say?
I prefer something a bit more subtle like...
Oh, I hate the way you chew.
I did hate the way he chewed.
and if they don't take the hint... - Get the hell away from me!
sounds about right.
I saw you! Get away from me!
stop!
get off of me!
who the hell are you? Who are you? - Calm down!
I saw him! I saw him!
what do you want?! I don't know what you're talking about!
nothing.
well, hey, there.
speedy Gonzales, huh? You almost killed Marlon from accounting.
I'm sorry, Tony.
I'm still getting used to how this thing drives.
and the world is still getting used to how you drive.
Where's the Mini?
thought it was time to make a change.
you know, put the past behind.
Oh, well, that's gonna be...harder than just buying a new car, you know.
Yes, I noticed.
so what's the plan with the Mini?
I sold it.
What?!
I told you if you ever wanted to get rid of it, that-that I would take it.
well, I didn't think you were serious.
what part of "I'm totally serious" made you think that?
I'm sorry, Tony. I know you wanted the car, but I just didn't think it was a good idea to sell it to you.
why not?
because I really liked my Mini. - Me, too.
and I didn't want anything to happen to it.
what are you saying?
she's saying you're a car killer.
What?! - A car killer.
everybody needs a hobby.
your new ride, Ziva?
nice. Thanks.
Oh, by the way, my friend Terry, loving your Mini.
get in the car.
where to, boss?
no, you and Ziva go up to the office.
we got it covered.
base security responded to the assault.
they said he was raving like a madman when they arrived.
demanded to speak with NCIS. About?
he said national security.
that's why I was chasing him.
no, you did more than chase him.
and how do you know he was following you?
because everywhere I go, there he is.
when I finally confronted the guy, he ran.
got away when those two leatherneck chicks pulled me off him.
but it's not just him.
someone's been going through my e-mail, too.
and how do you know that? Because they're marking messages as read that I didn't read.
I think they've even been in my house, they've been in my car...
I can smell the cologne.
they've even been in my trunk.
you have to help me.
I tried the cops. They thought I was crazy.
you said this was about national security.
that's right.
I work on a Navy destroyer.
Yes. As a...
cook.
culinary Specialist.
do you have any idea what would happen if a case of E coli broke out in my galley?
it could disable the entire ship.
what if they're trying to infect me with something, so that I infect the crew?
they? The people following me.
I think that maybe they're North Korean.
right.
are you on any medications?
no, I'm not on medications.
and would you stop scribbling in that notepad?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
these people are driving me crazy.
but I am not crazy. You have to believe me.
it all started two weeks ago, after I got mugged.
I see the same people everywhere I go.
I'm telling you, they're following me.
boss?
they always...
what the hell is that?
it's a GPS tracking device.
he's not crazy. Someone is following him.
let's go.
petty Officer Evan Lowry, 24, just returned from a six-month deployment on the U. S.S. Fitzgerald.
where he worked as a cook. Culinary Specialist.
TDY?
mess duty at Quantico, pending his next assignment.
he has no access to any sensitive material. And no unusual activity in his bank account.
nothing worth mentioning, unless you consider a sailor drinking like a sailor worth mentioning.
so why's he being followed?
okay, then who is following him?
Lowry is in the conference room working with a sketch artist.
Abby's taking the GPS tracker apart.
hopefully she can pull prints.
then there's the mugging. Lowry said that, uh, it all started after he was attacked.
maybe the mugger is the one following him.
eyewitnesses only gave a rough description.
and Lowry barely remembers the assault.
police report says that he got a concussion from a tire iron to the head.
also says his backpack and cell phone were stolen.
that'd mean the mugger would know where he lived.
think it's connected? I think it's our best lead.
Ziva, check out that sketch.
McGee, stolen cell phone, see if you can trace it.
well, thieves usually wipe stolen cell phones to make it harder to trace.
can you trace it?
I can try.
thank you.
if he's taken a photo and e-mailed it to anybody,
I can use the GPS coordinates from the EXIF data...
you do realize if you keep telling us how you do your job then we're not gonna need you anymore?
Oh, got a hit.
northwest DC.
go!
no, this is totally unacceptable.
how long do we have to wait for the inquiry into Ilan Bodnar's death?
because we'd like Sir... to get started with the debriefing.
so get someone from DoD-IG down here so we can close the book on this damn thing.
when?
so where the hell is he?
never mind. I found him.
I hope it's okay that your assistant told me to wait in your office.
richard Parsons, independent counsel retained by the Inspector General.
I'm here for the... - I know why you're here.
so get started.
actually, I just got back on the red-eye.
I was gonna... go home, shower, have some breakfast-- have you eaten yet?
I'll send for a sandwich.
a lot of paperwork to do. Well, great.
most people don't like it, but without paperwork the world would be...
so, you'll get started then?
immediately, if you want.
just inform the team that I'm here.
Yes, Director?
Yes, um, find Agents DiNozzo and McGee please.
of course.
Yes, thank you. You can start with them.
relax, Director.
I'm just here to cross some T's and dot some I's.
I'll be as quick and painless as possible.
never been on an actual DC stakeout before.
this is fun.
they don't let me out of the office very much.
Really?
could've fooled me.
thanks for letting me tag along.
well, we didn't.
director Vance insisted you join us.
so, what does that do?
we traced a stolen cell phone to this complex.
now we just need someone to use it to pinpoint its exact location.
can we just get this over with?
Yeah.
Thanks.
let me just get my briefcase open.
all right, so, let's set the Wayback Time Machine to the beginning, shall we? So that's, what, January?
when did you first become aware that, uh, Eli David was in town?
Gibbs told us that Friday morning.
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Someone's coming.
someone's coming.
Nope. Wrong sex.
Ah, right sex.
wrong time. Well, speaking of time, what time did Agent David say that she was going to meet her father for Shabbat dinner?
not sure exactly.
before sundown.
well, how do you know if you're not sure exactly?
cause I've seen Yentl.
well played.
well, this matches up with everything I got, so T's are being crossed.
I just got one more question for you guys.
yeah?
how does one go to the bathroom on a stakeout?
I could get into this.
Oh, hold off. I got something.
someone's making a call.
where?
northeast corner.
Oh, there we go.
all right. Listen, be a dear and finish that before we get back.
Yeah. Thanks.
he had your cell phone on him. Your backpack was in his car.
he look familiar?
I think that's the guy who mugged me.
maybe?
I don't really remember the attack, to be honest.
question is, does he know anything about who's been following you?
Hey, I found that cell phone in the trash, man.
somebody must've thrown it away.
Really?
Yeah.
okay.
thanks for coming.
sit down.
you're doing two to 15 for armed robbery, so, make some peace with that, and let's move on, all right?
armed robbery, man. I didn't rob no...
two to 15.
and another 20 in a federal prison for illegal surveillance.
say what?
but you tell me about this, and who's been following Petty Officer Lowry, and I'll make sure that both your sentences are served concurrently.
Yeah, sure, I... I know where that came from.
but if you want me to talk, I want the assault charges dropped.
first. In writing.
you'll tell me where the girl is?
girl? There's no girl.
he doesn't know that.
I'll take you right to her.
only I know where she at, so you need me.
you know?
lead you right to her, man.
you got a day job?
no. Get one.
and don't quit it. What...?
what's happening?
he doesn't know who's been following you.
how can you be sure?
because Gibbs is sure.
and I'm definitely sure.
about whatever it is we're sure about.
I'm sure we hit a dead end.
well, then, I'm right on time, because I have found intrigue.
I was processing your stolen backpack, and there was nothing left except this.
it was smoothed up in the corner.
it looks like the last page of some sort of legal disclaimer.
legal disclaimer? For what?
well, that part's missing, but this releases someone from all liability for your...
physical and mental trauma. - Yeah.
disability, destruction of personal property, mental anguish, dismemberment, death.
what exactly did you sign up for?
I have no idea.
I don't remember.
try again.
fix your gaze on your signature.
remember the feeling of signing your name.
where you were.
I'm sorry. I got nothing.
why can't I remember?
well, the time-stamp on this document indicates that you signed it a few hours before your assault, in which you suffered a serious concussion.
I don't remember that, either.
the only thing I remember from that day is my best friend, when she picked me up from the hospital.
you know, it's not unusual for head-trauma victims to lose their memory for the entire day prior to their injuries.
how's it going? - Not well.
I can't remember what I signed up for, or if it has anything to do with the people following me.
let's try another approach.
try to recall any sights or sounds from the day you signed this.
odors, even.
the only thing I'm smelling is...
bleach and isopropyl alcohol...
and a... hint of citrus?
Yeah, that's our autopsy disinfectant.
good nose!
then again, you are a cook.
culinary Specialist.
sorry.
wait a minute.
I'm smelling something else, too.
something familiar.
smell is remarkably powerful at evoking memories.
yes?
paprika...
...coriander, nutmeg.
Ah, you're smelling the contents of a prior occupant's stomach.
pickled fennel?
very rare.
well, our John Doe's last meal consisted of an impressive amount of... Bratwurst.
that's correct.
whatever I signed up for had something to do with bratwurst.
that exact blend.
my favorite thing about my job is-is the mystery.
Abby, figure out where this bratwurst came from. Ask me why.
I don't know.
ask me how this fits into the case.
I don't know.
it's just... A mystery.
Yes.
so what's the plan here?
well, first,
I will simulate the effects of digestive juices on a typical bratwurst protein.
then I can match that to a known brand...
and the rest is Gibbstory.
hmm. How do you account for instrument drift?
Oh, I just... I mix a reference compound into the main analyte flow, and then...
Hey, wait a minute.
uh, I minored in Forensic Science in college.
I like to keep up with the field.
I'm surprised you don't.
excuse me?
well, it's just that you're using an internal reference when you can get much better results by using an external electrospray probe.
don't you have some questions that you need to ask me, or something?
Oh, uh, okay, right.
uh, five months ago, you processed a memory card that had a photo of the man who killed Tyler Wilkes.
Yes. And that man was Mossad Director Eli David.
well, we didn't know that at the time, because the photos only showed the back of his head.
Oh, and...
I use two separate analyte streams for redundancy, Dick.
Yeah, for what that's worth.
and my name is Richard.
do you want to fight? 'Cause I will fistfight you in your head right now.
I'm just saying... In your head, I'll...
how could you tell it was Eli David if you could only see the back of his head?
because Ziva told us it was her father.
she told you? Well, she told Gibbs.
right before Eli was killed.
it must have been difficult for her.
Ziva is loyal to a fault.
no doubt.
"to a fault" is exactly how I'd put it.
that's it. Thank you.
seems like something one of your agents would do.
Yeah, well, can use the fresh air.
or you're avoiding that guy who's been poking around asking all those questions.
so, any of it ring a bell?
sorry, I got nothing.
but the more I smell this number five special, the more I know it's got something to do with all this.
three down...
six more to go.
what?
what? What? What? What? What? What?
B-12-- it's a water-soluble vitamin commonly found in poultry and fish.
that looks familiar.
I think I've been here before.
definitely been here before.
this is it! For sure!
that's the guy who's been following me!
there's the bratwurst. - Wait. Hold on.
Hey, knock it off! - Dr. Hale!
Dr. Hale? - What are you waiting for?
arrest him! - Petty Officer, calm down!
Evan! Wait-- you know him?
Yeah, of course.
he's one of our test subjects.
test subjects?!
Evan volunteered to be part of the Helping Eyes Initiative, a two-week study examining the psychological effects of surveillance.
between traffic cams, drones, smart phones, we're a surveillance society now.
and the government wants to know how people react to being watched.
so they can get better at it.
terrorists are getting better at hiding, too, so, we need to up our game, as well.
you need to avoid looking at me.
hale: We recruited people like Evan here, who agreed to be watched, to have their mail opened, etcetera, while we documented the whole thing.
you recorded the mugging?
no, we hadn't started yet.
Evan was attacked just a few hours after he signed up.
something I don't remember doing.
that eventually became clear to us, yes.
why didn't you call off the test? - Are you kidding?
his ignorance of our experiment made him the perfect test subject.
glad you were getting your kicks while I was tearing my house apart looking for bugs.
you want to press charges?
Charges?! For what?
following someone with a video camera?
reckless endangerment.
you do that, we'll be shut down.
all our work gets confiscated, and good luck getting your check.
check?
Yes, this is a paid study.
well, now that I think about it...
it does sound kind of interesting.
hale: You were quite excited when you signed up.
and now that you're done, we owe you some money.
15 hundred bucks! Wow.
so is Lowry pressing charges?
more importantly, can I sign up?
he is not, and Gibbs is not happy.
he wants us to look into the doctor that's running the experiment.
there are a number of Navy personnel in the study.
Ah. Gotcha.
so, Lowry's not the only one getting the shaft?
uh, excuse me?
agent David, have you got a minute?
you're next on my list.
conference room busy?
uh, unfortunately, it is.
it was either this, or the parking garage.
this will be fine.
I'll get started on the doc.
well, after spending a few hours in the car with him, I can say that Agent DiNozzo is a capable investigator.
more than capable.
unfortunately, he can also be quite a child.
this was a mistake.
the conference room is not busy.
I was just there.
no, it's not busy.
so, why did you choose this room?
are you trying to make me uncomfortable for some reason?
are you uncomfortable... for some reason?
I have nothing to hide.
I also do not have a lot of time.
time... time, time, time, time, time.
Abby Sciuto recovered photos that indicated your father was guilty of murder.
Yes.
and according to Agent DiNozzo, you saw those photos before sundown.
it's all in my report.
yet you waited three hours before you told Agent Gibbs anything.
that is a lot of time.
trust me. It was better for everyone that I speak to my father first.
it was better for everyone.
it certainly wasn't better for, uh, Ilan Bodnar that you spoke with him first.
according to your official report, he lost his footing during your fight, and then fell to his death.
I tried to save him.
Really?
you tried to save him?
you tried to save the man that killed your father? Yes!
so he could answer for his crimes.
and what about yours?
shin Bet, Israeli security agency.
Yes. Is it a crime to have friends now?
it depends.
did you sleep with your friend?
I beg your pardon?
did you sleep with him?
he is a foreign national.
you are a federal agent.
that is a threat to national security.
have you been following me?
answer the question!
did you sleep with him?
go to hell!
interview is over.
you don't have the authority.
it's over.
two seconds ago.
door.
you can keep the photo of your boyfriend.
so.
over.
ten seconds ago.
tonight, the fire department responded to a three-alarm blaze after an explosion...
Gibbs, we may have a problem...
we do.
there was an explosion at the office running the experiment Lowry had signed up for.
that's a hell of a coincidence.
Yeah.
isn't it?
you talk to Gibbs yet?
about what?
about your interrogation.
there is nothing to talk about.
parsons is simply conducting a routine investigation.
you told him to go to hell.
does not mean I have to like it.
but I have nothing to hide.
so, then, national security isn't threatened by you and...?
now you're asking the questions.
that was merely a statement with the possibility of a question mark at the end.
I went to Israel to bury my father.
it was a moment of weakness.
I felt alone.
you need to talk to Legal.
no, I don't.
my Hebrew must not be as good as I thought, because I could've sworn that when I dropped you off at the airport, I told you you were not alone.
Yes, you did.
well, then...
we must have different interpretations.
what's cooking?
fuse box.
chief said that's where the fire started.
someone was messing with the breaker panel feeding into the office.
caused every computer in the suite to blow out.
all of Dr. Hale's data, all of her video surveillance, it's all gone.
interesting.
Where's Hale?
according to the first responders, she was the only one in the building.
she was taken to the hospital with minor burns.
lucky.
and by that, I mean convenient.
find out which. I'll talk to her.
Ziva, McGee, background on the doctor's test subjects.
everybody she was following.
Yeah, Duck.
Jethro, I apologize for the timing, but I just completed my interview with Mr. Parsons.
Yeah, and...?
we have a problem.
let's hear it.
I do not believe that our seemingly innocent interrogator is here simply to dot the I's and cross the T's.
I got that impression, too. What do you think, Ziva?
okay.
let's hear it.
it is nothing.
parsons just got a little aggressive with me during the interview.
it is not nothing, Ziva.
given the interview I just had, I believe the man is out for blood.
yours.
I knew that guy was trouble.
he's like an evil McGee.
he left this photograph.
do you recognize that man, Ziva?
no.
michael Fassbender?
I can see it in his eyes.
were you aware that Mr. Pinkhas once worked for the Israeli government?
no, that's impossible.
well, according to Parsons, he was briefly in their employ for an operation that began in 1972.
september, to be precise.
Munich.
Mm. Just like the movie.
Shmeil, played by Eric Bana.
well, what does that have to do with Ziva?
well, Parsons was interested in her repeated contact with a former Israeli black bag operative.
he also wanted to know if I was aware of her relationship with Adam Eshel.
he's fishing.
he's questioning her loyalty.
Yes.
to what?
and her adopted country.
does he think I'm a spy or something?
I have no idea what his endgame is.
nor what is motivating him, but it is clear this is a witch hunt.
what the hell are we gonna do about this?
sorry, I-I'm miffed.
well...
I fear we just have to wait until the dealer shows his full hand.
waiting isn't even one of the top hundred things I'm good at.
and we're not gonna wait.
we're gonna count.
cards.
see what's left in Parsons' deck.
I love watching you hack.
don't tell anyone I said that. - Don't worry,
I won't. But technically, I haven't hacked anything yet.
NCIS already has access to the DoD database with Parsons' case files. What do you got?
what do you got?
well, it looks like a collection of all the paperwork on Eli David and Bodnar.
that tells us nothing. We wrote most of it.
McGee: Hold on a minute.
there's a locked file here from the U. S. Justice Department.
is Parsons actually going for an indictment?
who is he talking to at Justice?
that may be a tough hack, boss.
I'd have to bypass the external firewall, but...
investigators believe that, while the power surge in Dr. Hale's office was intentional, the resulting fire was not.
Tony: We followed up on her test subjects-- all accounted for but one:
a civilian.
manages a shoe store.
where is he?
he disappeared after the explosion, and I'm gonna go with suspicious.
there's no activity from his cell phone.
checking his bank account.
we'll put out a BOLO, but we may have a better way to track him.
Hale told me she made weekly backups of her video surveillance.
they were recording Simon for a while.
there might be something there that'll tell us where he's hiding.
go.
Ziva, look at that lead from McGee.
on it. I have some friends I can talk to.
you want to talk?
ready when you are.
it's good to know.
but I'm afraid you're gonna have to wait your turn.
What'd I miss?
you were only gone two minutes.
it felt like two hours.
God, this is so addicting.
does he floss?
he seems like a flosser.
what are those meds he's taking?
I like moving images.
and I could use a diversion right now.
when the cereal's gone, he doesn't drink the rest of the milk.
that's such a Simon move.
if you know him so well, how about figuring out where he's hiding.
assuming he's not dead.
bite your tongue.
Tony, the problem with a study like this is,
Simon may have signed up to be followed, but that doesn't mean everyone he met wanted to be filmed.
what's your point?
well, he could have a buddy who's a drug dealer.
drug dealers tend to not like being recorded.
Simon doesn't have any buddies.
he has a cat.
he spends all of his time by himself.
at the aquarium. did we mark that down?
kind of sad.
what a waste of an 802. 11-enabled Trojan Horse Code Planter.
what a waste of words.
what?
from Abby.
it survived the fire in Dr. Hale's lab.
it remotely installs an application on smart phones that turns the cell into a bug.
that could come in handy.
right?
instead of having to plant an actual bug, all you need to do is get close enough and hit that button.
well, keep it away from me.
don't flatter yourself.
last thing I want to do is to hear you...
if this is Dorneget, I swear to God...
Oh. What's wrong?
I was locked out, that's what's wrong.
I was coming to brief you on what I learned from my contact at Justice, but when I tried to open the door, my retina scan was denied.
your security clearance has been suspended.
Parsons.
you brief McGee.
I'll go tell Gibbs.
almost missed it.
Ah. Going down.
were you able to find out anything on that locked file?
not specifically.
but my contact at Justice gave me this list of all the files Parsons has been accessing.
most of them from the NCIS archives.
what's he doing going through our archives?
you must have a pretty warped sense of humor.
probably the kind of guy that thinks the laugh track on Sports Night made it funnier.
so, this is how you do it, huh?
I got you.
just play it cool, wait for a reaction?
Hey, I got one for you.
what's that tell you?
that you're afraid.
parsons has been pulling hundreds of case files.
some of these files are from before you even got here.
you're messing with the wrong federal agents.
you can question how we do things, but don't ever question the loyalty of Ziva David.
even if she dissed you and slept with some stranger?
you're gonna poke the bear, huh?
it's effective.
until the bear eats you.
for doing my job?
for going after the bear's best friend.
what makes you think I'm going after Ziva?
McGee, there's only one person these files have in common.
parsons is not after me.
he's going after the director.
if Parsons is compiling my greatest hits, then why put the screws to David?
leverage.
we believe he's hoping to get me to flip.
perhaps to bring to light some aspects of our hunt for Bodnar that were...
icy. Dicey.
we had our reasons.
Yes, we did.
as Director, though...
it's only right that this should fall on me.
I've been doing some checking.
parsons is a rising star in the DC private legal sector.
he's trying to make a name for himself.
not if we can help it.
we'll know if he makes a move.
we've got ears to the ground, and, maybe, accidentally,
NTrojan-horse style listening apps on his phone?
you bugged Parsons?
we shared an elevator.
I forgot it was in my pocket.
I appreciate that you've got my back, but there are some things, uh, you should keep me in the dark about.
sorry I'm late.
didn't you get my text? Just now.
there's no personal cell phones in MTAC, remember?
what, am I the only one that follows that rule?
you got something, McGee? Yeah.
aquarium? Yup.
we got him.
bring him in.
best way to stay under Parsons' radar is to keep working.
keep me informed.
meantime, I'm gonna call in some favors.
that's about how I feel right now.
the Simon Show seem different to you?
is he on new meds or something?
looks more like he's off his meds.
personal space, McGrope.
sorry.
only available outlet.
in the building?
the server in here is on its own network.
I do not want the signal from Parsons' phone being traced to my desk.
don't worry. I'll be quiet.
you signed up for a study that watches you 24/7.
and then you fell off the grid.
no cell, no credit cards.
emptied your bank account an hour ago.
you going somewhere, Simon?
Oh, somebody cares!
definitely off his meds.
not exactly Gibbs' specialty.
well, yeah, I signed up for that study.
I needed the cash.
then you changed your mind.
why'd you disappear?
it's none of your business.
actually, yeah, it is my business.
the building with your surveillance tapes was torched.
Oh, isn't that just the icing on the cake!
you know who did this?
Yeah, I do, but it doesn't really matter 'cause you're never gonna find him.
it does matter.
talk, or it's accessory-after-the-fact.
God.
God burned down that building.
why were you running?
...to let me know just how worthless I really am! Why were you running?
because I hate my life!
it's like an episode of Bipolar Intervention.
I haven't had a steady job in...
see? ...two years.
I don't have any friends, let alone a girlfriend.
driving my '99 Miata to Beltway Burgers on Wednesday night is what passes for my social life.
I needed a fresh start, okay?
Yeah, I met someone who didn't like being recorded.
it was me.
before, I could pretend that I wasn't worthless, but once the cameras started rolling, I realized how I must look on tape.
you destroyed the footage.
God, you're not listening.
it wasn't me.
yesterday was Wednesday.
I was at Beltway Burgers all night, remember?
go ahead and check.
I'm sorry, I don't know who did this, but I doubt it was someone in the study.
what kind of an idiot would get into trouble knowing there was a camera crew following him around?
someone who didn't remember.
petty Officer Lowry.
agent Gibbs.
you should have called.
I'm kind of in the middle of lunch.
are you going to introduce me?
sure.
agent Gibbs, this is, uh, Stella and Abner.
he's a cutie, and he has his mother's eyes.
agent Gibbs, is it?
nice to meet you.
likewise.
corporal.
we went through all your tapes.
we ran facial recognition on everyone you met while you were being followed.
she popped up.
you're UA, Corporal.
and you've been helping her hide.
which is why you caused that fire-- to protect her.
fire? What's going on, Evan?
petty Officer Lowry signed up to be followed for a psych experiment.
you only had to remember one thing.
to stay away from your oldest friend in the world until it was done.
but I didn't remember.
when we found Dr. Hale, I realized I led the cameras right to Stella.
then got NCIS involved.
if her face flagged in the system...
she would have been caught.
what did you do, Evan?
she didn't know, Agent Gibbs.
about any of it.
and the fire wasn't supposed to happen.
I was just trying to wipe any record of Stella from the servers.
I was trying to make it right.
Yeah. I know.
I'm so sorry, Stella.
I'm a dedicated Marine, sir.
as dedicated as they come. I read your file.
but after I had Abner, things changed.
last month, I got orders for a third tour.
afghanistan.
Evan was just trying to protect us.
haven't you ever bent the rules to protect a friend?
like having your own office? A little.
okay, a lot.
I love it. I never get to listen to my own music out loud.
or live in your own filth.
so, what's the scoop with Parsons?
well, I've been listening all day.
he, uh, had a few meetings at the Pentagon, made some calls, but nothing revealing.
where is he now?
he's down in the lobby.
he's making a phone call.
what?
what did he say?!
boss, we got a problem!
what's the matter now, McGee?
we had it wrong.
Bodnar's only part of this.
parsons isn't after Ziva or Vance.
he...
that's a lot of manpower.
your reputation proceeds you.
don't act too surprised.
or did I not give you enough time to prepare?
you got something to say, say it.
special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, you've manipulated evidence, and you've obstructed justice.
do you take full responsibility for the actions of your team?
what do you think?
the field is out of the gate...headed straightaway for this feature race.
the track fast, weather clear, six furlongs out of the chute.
the flag is up. We may get a start any moment.
battling Fur at a little fraction. And there they go.
channel Boy breaks on top, Picassio's away at second...
...Harper's Ferry third.
that's all you gotta do, girlie?
what? -Feeding pigeons, for crying out loud.
Why? -Why not?
what? -What a park.
would you care for a peanut? -Would I what for?
peanut? Care for?
I bothering you? -No.
okay. So why you wanna bother me?
who's?
what a park.
you said it. A person can't even open their mouth in it.
Hey, how about you shut up? We're trying to play a serious game here.
look, girlie, I don't mind a pickup once in a while...
...only I like to do the picking, see?
how'd you like to watch some of your language?
who are you? -Nobody, that's who.
so, what are you trying to make a big stink?
who, me? -Sure, you. Not who.
comes in, walking in barefooty, sits down on the top of me...
top of? -...starts throwing around peanuts...
...gets all them dusty birds over.
top it off, she tries to pick me up, as if I ain't got enough troubles now.
listen, how'd you like a good smack in your face?
why don't you try it. -Because it's too hot's why.
what a park.
how'd you like that? -Not bad. A real interesting shot.
is there a water fountain around here?
Yeah. Come on, I'll show you.
my whole throat's dry from getting so mad.
no, no. Probably from the peanuts, no doubt.
have one? -Thanks.
What'd you say about a shot?
movie shot, grabbed it while you were screeching.
what's the idea? -It's my business. Documentaries.
what's that? -Well, I make movies.
only they're about real things. People, places, things.
this one I'm working on now is about Central Park.
well, I'm glad you think I'm a real thing.
Decidedly.
have a drink. On me.
what are you doing, following me around?
let's go, sunshine.
what a park!
you think he'll be all right? -I doubt it.
okay, son? -I'm thirsty.
come on, Michael.
ma, can I have a dime? -No, Michael.
I'm losing my patience with you.
I wanna get a bottle of soda. I'm thirsty.
no, Michael. You've had enough to drink.
no. I'm losing my patience with you.
wait till your father hears about this day.
are you a New Yorker?
only since about less than two years. Are you?
ten years, still not used to it. I'm from Westfield, New Jersey.
the one thing I can't understand about New York...
...is why everybody here's so unfriendly.
I've wondered too. Where are you from?
Binghamton. Upstate New York.
Pete Sheppard. How do you do? -Thank you.
well, do you have a name? -Of course.
well?
yeah? -Gladys Glover.
glad to know you, Gladys. -Thank you.
Gladys Glover, huh? -It's not much of a name.
why do you say that? -Because nobody ever heard of it.
and I guess nobody ever will.
you mind that? -Of course.
you're on the young side what that seems so important.
after a while, you won't care so much. -Sure, because then it'll be too late.
what's your line?
well, since this morning about 1 1: 30, nothing.
I got canned on account of three-quarters of an inch.
around the hips. -Well, think of that.
I had this good job modeling girdles.
you know what they are? -Well, sure.
this designer and the boss got into a whole hassle...on account of a couple of wrinkles. Back and forth. Back and forth.
I was in the middle.
so the designer says the girdle's the right size, I'm the wrong size.
so the boss says, "I'll bet you $50.
so Mr. Ostrander took the bet.
he's a designer.
they got out a tape measure.
just my luck. This morning, three-quarters of an inch too much.
so it would've been all right, except on account of losing the $50.
the boss tells me to go get my time.
I wouldn't get discouraged.
sometimes you lose a job just to get a better one.
I don't know.
I just wanna think it over. I mean, the whole thing over.
that's why I came here to the park.
I always think I can think better in the park.
that's why I took my shoes off.
I always think better with my shoes off. You ever notice that?
on or off, I have trouble.
but what I have to think about...
...is if I should stay in New York in the first place, or else go back home.
I mean, you take New York.
you never meet anybody to talk to...
...unless it's somebody you happen to know...
...or somebody fresh or looking for something they're not entitled to.
it's an extremely unfriendly community.
if you only knew how long it took me to save up the $1 000.
what $1 000? -That I saved up.
the reason I came to New York was to try and make a name for myself.
and I haven't even gotten started on it.
I'm getting nowhere. You know what I mean?
some people, when they get to that point...
...where they realize that they're getting nowhere...
...they just kill themselves.
but I don't feel like it.
well, that is a fairly drastic step.
the only other thing is to go back home.
do the same thing as everybody else.
go back to work in the shoe factory.
marry the first man that asks.
or the second.
and then...
...goodbye "name for yourself.
goodbye dreams.
in fact, goodbye, Charlie.
if you'll forgive me, Gladys...
...I'd better get back to being gainfully employed.
thanks for the peanuts. -You're more than welcome.
say, if you'd care to give me your address...
...I could drop you a postcard and show you this picture when it's done.
I'd give my right arm to see myself in the movies.
just give me your right address.
262 West 61 st. -Yeah? Fine.
room 9.
well, so long, Gladys.
I saw that in a French movie last week. I've been meaning to try it ever since.
good luck to you, Gladys. I sure hope you make a name for yourself.
lf that's what you want, you'll get it. -How?
it's just a theory of mine that not only where there's a will, there's a way...
...but where there's a way, there's a will. See?
so long. -Thanks.
yes? -What?
someone?
I want to see Mr. Pfeiffer, please.
who? -Mr. Horace Pfeiffer.
lsn't this his place? -This is the Horace Pfeiffer Company.
but there is no Mr. Pfeiffer.
excuse me. -Just what was this in reference to?
to...
about the sign on Columbus Circle.
yes?
it says it's for rent.
yes?
well, so who do I see in reference to it if there's no Mr. Pfeiffer like you say?
well, one moment.
well, that's Mr. Entrikin.
walk down the hall and turn left, on the floor below.
no, no. I don't want the average space.
give me the exact footage on each location.
come.
what was that? All right, go ahead.
good morning. Have a chair.
thank you.
go ahead.
you.
it's about the sign space you have for rent over there in Columbus Circle.
how many? All right.
Oh, yes, the double bulletin board.
I don't know what you call it. It's pretty big, all right.
right. I'll take it up with C. D.
Yes, that's available.
how much do you charge to rent it?
well, now, just whom do you represent?
Oh, just myself.
I see.
but what's your idea?
of what?
of making this inquiry. -Oh, I'm not making any inquiry.
I just wanna rent that sign.
that is, if it isn't too expensive.
I see.
well, it's something personal, if that's what you mean.
I'm sorry, but I'm too busy for this sort of thing.
what sort of thing? What's the matter?
well, here's to pay for it with and everything.
yes?
see if you can get an option.
of course, if you're too stuck-up...
...or you think it's right to treat somebody like some kind of a nut.
call you back.
I just happened to be walking along and the sign said for rent...
...and it said your name and your address, so I want it.
so you say you haven't got the time. What kind of a place is this anyway?
the space rate on that location is $21 0 per month.
three months minimum.
yes? -Never mind 1 1: 40. 1 1: 30's all right.
I'll take it. -What?
what's the matter?
nothing. Nothing.
wait a second. Wait a minute.
Hey. Hey, painters.
wait a minute. Hey.
Hey, sign painters, listen. Hey, listen.
what's that? -G. G.
What'd she say? -"Oh, gee.
not C, like you got it. G, like you haven't got it.
what?
not C, like you got it. G, like you haven't got it.
look at the paper.
what?
look at the paper.
sure enough.
Thanks, lady. -Thank you.
faster.
please, faster.
I don't want excuses. I just want that space.
but, Mr. Adams, you said you'd call me by Monday.
what about it? -Well, you didn't.
well, what about it? -Well, then I phoned you.
well?
and they said that you were still away on your weekend.
Oh, they did? -So I tried again on Tuesday
all right, all right.
then I just assumed you'd lost interest.
you know that the Adams Soap Company...
...has always used that space for every summer campaign.
you know how my father feels about that space.
he's very partial to it. -I know
why don't we all watch our blood pressure, Mr. Adams.
I'm sure it can be arranged. -Nothing to it.
don't smooth me, gentlemen.
right now he tells us it's tied up for three months.
excuse me. -Yes, but I'm quite sure that as soon
send her right in, please.
she's here. Troubles are over.
sit down, Miss Glover.
sit down.
go ahead.
now, Miss Glover, thank you very much for coming up.
I told you on the phone that you wouldn't regret it, and you won't.
these gentlemen are terribly keen to use that Columbus Circle space...
...which you have tied up right now.
now, they're fully aware that in asking you to give it up...
...they're probably interfering with some plans which you have.
after all, nobody hires display space just to put their name on it.
what they're prepared to do is this.
and in my opinion, it's a very handsome offer indeed.
reimburse you to the full extent of what you've spent so far...
...and in addition, make you a bonus of
I think the figure mentioned was $500.
I don't think so.
Oh, this is Mr. Evan Adams lll. Miss Gladys Glover.
how do you do? -How do you do, Mr. Adams lll?
why not? -Why not what?
would you care to make a counterproposal, Miss Glover?
what's that?
well, if you won't accept 500, what would you accept?
Oh, nothing.
come now. Surely you have some figure in mind.
no, I haven't.
you would take 5 million, wouldn't you?
Oh, certainly.
now, somewhere between 500 and 5 million...
...there must be an acceptable figure.
I don't wanna do this. In 73 days more, the whole thing will be over...
...and then you can have it back and do whatever you want.
I don't like being hollered at.
What'd I do anyway?
excuse me.
hello. -Hello.
Hello! -Hello.
well, what are you doing around here anyway?
I live here.
where? -Room 7.
since when? -Today.
gee, that's great.
I wasn't figuring on this much of a welcome.
you're welcome.
what's happened to you? Last time, you were ready for the river.
that's over now. I'm fine.
I haven't changed. I'm the same as I was before.
only in a different way. -I see.
well, I have to go up now. -Yeah, so do l.
say, you happen to be over around Columbus Circle lately this week?
no.
why don't you go up there sometime.
what for? -Oh, look around.
at what? -Different things.
such as what?
different signs.
signs? -Sure.
don't you ever look at signs? -I suppose.
take my word. If you go up there around Columbus Circle...
...you'll see something.
Gladys.
is it possible you've been out in the sun too much today?
well, not me personally, no. -What?
is that your room, seven?
you like to see it? My room? -All right.
not really settled down yet.
what kind of view is it from here? -Oh, enchanting.
what's a good place to eat around here?
room 9. -I meant for me.
glad to have you anytime.
I couldn't do that, unless you let me take you out
sure. Why not?
well, what about tonight? -Okay.
fine. -You wanna see my room?
sure thing.
my view wasn't so beautiful last week...
...but this week it's sensational.
notice anything?
no. What?
what's the matter with your eyesight?
nothing.
you got any ideas for after dinner?
I thought it would be nice to go over to Columbus Circle...
...and sit around.
well, sure, if you want to.
but that doesn't sound like entertainment to me.
wait and see. -Gladys?
l-- -Yes?
Oh, excuse me.
did you get your message? -No.
I left it by the phone. You have to call Mr. Adams.
the third? -No, he only called twice.
excuse me.
I guess you two are pretty old friends, huh?
Oh, yes, indeed.
I hear you have a movie machine in there.
Oh, that's right.
I'll show you some fascinating documentaries.
don't do me no favors. Pay your rent 5: 00 Fridays...
...no radio after 11, and we'll get along fine.
check.
well, sure, but I mean, what's the point, Mr. Adams?
well, I know, but it's not a question of any deal.
well, sure, I'm open-minded.
no. Why should I have anything against you?
what kind of a break?
okay, 7: 30.
goodbye.
yes?
Oh, look, about tonight, I'm sorry, but I can't.
it's sort of business, you know what I mean.
well, sure, if it's business.
well, maybe tomorrow night.
no. I have to go to Westfield for a couple days. Family stuff.
and I won't be back till Friday morning.
all right, what about Friday lunch? -Okay.
wish you'd told me before I got my hair brushed.
I'm sorry. -Yes, I am too.
I was looking forward to a big evening sitting around Columbus Circle.
Pete, listen.
everything's beginning to go great for me, just great.
in a way, it's all on account of you.
lt is? -Something you said.
well, it made me do something I did.
and, well, that's why. -Well, that's fine.
so thank you very much. -lt was really nothing.
thank you. -What for?
for coming out this way. -What way?
I mean, I appreciate it. -So do l.
Oh, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, no, wait.
wait. Where are you going? -What is it?
aren't you gonna go around Columbus?
what for? -To see it.
lt? -What this whole date's about.
what? -What I've got that you want.
what you've got--? -The sign.
Oh, the sign. Yes. Yes, of course.
every time I see it, I get a bigger one than last time. Boot.
would you drive around once more? -A pleasure.
if you knew what it means to me...
...how it makes me feel and all...
if you knew, you wouldn't ask me for it.
not even for your own soap.
I have another idea. -Like?
well, l-- -Once more?
what? -Around once more.
but just once more. I'm getting a little hungry.
what's food?
now, what I had in mind was this...
...that we share the sign. Then we'd all be happy.
I'm happy now.
when you think that last week I was nobody...
...and this week I've got my name on that big sign...
...and dancing in a place like this where everybody's somebody.
you said something up at the office. -Yeah.
something about 73 days more? -From tomorrow, 72.
now, my idea is this.
if you split the space with us, you could be up there for six months.
I could? -I'd see to it.
in writing?
if you like.
only not in such big letters, huh?
well, no.
look! -What?
Walter Winchell. -Oh, yeah.
that makes the seventh big name I've seen tonight.
what a night.
well, good night. -Good night.
thank you very much. -Not at all.
I had a real good time.
unusual. -So did l.
well, good night. -Good night.
well, good night. -Good night.
well, this is it.
what? -Where I live.
Oh, good. -So I guess I better go in.
very well.
because it's pretty late. -Yes, it is.
and besides, I don't think your car's safe down there.
no? -You don't know this neighborhood.
locked.
they don't need keys, not around this neighborhood.
I'm scared you'll lose your car.
I have another one.
shall we?
see that? -What?
you better go.
I'll call you tomorrow. -Okay, but
but I don't think I wanna give up my sign.
yes? -Open up.
who is it, please? -Open up.
what do you think--? -I wanna talk to you.
what about? -That thing up in Columbus Circle.
I went over there, all right.
first off, I couldn't believe my eyes. Then I thought, "What a gag.
since then, I have been thinking about it, and it gets my goat.
Why?
I smoked a pack and a half of cigarettes trying to figure it out.
what out? -And you.
cost money, doesn't it?
certainly. -Where'd you get it?
it's my own. I saved it up.
and is that the best you can think of to do--?
what sort of a fruitcake are you anyway?
no sort of.
so kindly get out of my room, please. -With pleasure.
it's none of your business.
lt is if there's a maniac on the loose. -I'm no maniac
just once, every so often, something really gets my goat.
and this is one!
to think I actually know a grown-up, civilized woman...
...who can take her hard-earned cash, just take it and throw it away...
...on a nonsense, as though it were garbage!
you hear me ask you what you do with your money?
don't bother, I haven't even got any. -All I did
all I did is happen to meet you in the park, by accident.
so I don't see where that gives you the right to tell me off.
correct.
and furthermore, different people do different things...
...that may seem crazy to other different people...
...but that doesn't make it.
correct.
and furthermore, do me a favor and butt out!
would you do me a favor? -Like what?
remember my name? -Sure, Pete Sheppard.
well, do me a favor and forget it!
ls it still on for Friday lunch? -Certainly!
thank you very much! -Don't mention it!
so the point that we're trying to make is just this...
...that there's no reason for you to be unreasonable.
I don't think I'm unreasonable.
you don't? -No.
I think I'm reasonable. You're the ones that are "un.
wait a minute. Here's something. -Where?
would this be a solution?
supposing we gave you two signs in trade for this one?
two?
possibly three?
how big?
I don't know offhand. We'd have to look into it.
but not as big as this one, huh? -Possibly not, no.
no soap. -What?
after all, Gladys-- Miss Glover, the size of the sign doesn't matter.
no? -No.
no, it's the location.
now, what if we found you four fine locations...
...and fitted them up for you?
how about six?
very well, six. -And where?
let me have the chart, will you, please?
well... -Most desirable.
and one in the 42nd Street subway station.
well... -Then there's one on the West Side.
yeah? -And one on the East Side.
yeah? -And one in Grand Central Station.
so now I'm all over the place.
this may be the best lamb chop I ever had.
one of them's an electric sign. Did I say that?
you sure know what to do with them.
I bet if I held out for eight signs instead of six, I would've got eight.
fish is what I like.
did you ever go down to the Fulton Fish Market?
no. -I'd like to take you down there.
how about tomorrow night? -Fine.
and on the way down, you can look at some of my signs.
the Central Park picture's practically finished.
Really? -I just need to get some music.
I'm dying to see it. -Next week.
you know what would be nice? -What?
if you took pictures of some of my signs and put it in.
you certainly are one fine cook, Gladys.
I bet I'm the only cook that's got her name up...
...on six signs all over New York.
what's the point of it? Where's it getting you? No place.
no place?
I started out with no signs, so then I got one sign...
...so then I got six.
so where do you get "no place"?
I don't know what it is, honey, but I cannot get through to you.
let me put it this way.
what most people, real people, want is privacy.
that's about the best thing anybody can have.
not me.
what is this craze to get well-known? -Why craze?
do you think everybody is so anxious to be above the crowd?
Yes. -But what's the point of it?
in the first place, everybody can't be above the crowd, can they?
no. But everybody can try if they want to.
but why isn't it more important to learn how to be a part of the crowd?
not me.
it isn't just making a name. Don't you understand that?
it's making a name stand for something.
names stand for different things. -So who said not?
want my opinion? -No.
my opinion is this. It's better if your name stands for something...
...on one block than if it stands for nothing all over the entire world.
I don't follow your point.
I wish you could. This thing is getting more in our way every day.
what do you mean "in our way"?
I mean that...
there's a lot of things, sensible things...
...we could talk about and do and try for...
...but I can't seem to get you down to Earth.
what's so wonderful about Earth?
well, when this whole thing is over...
...when the bubble bursts, I'll show you.
Pete?
do you like me?
I sure do, except for one thing.
well, if you do, don't you be the one to burst the bubble.
okay.
and another thing.
could I ask you one question? -Sure, Gladys.
would you come out and look at one sign?
best coffee I ever had in my whole mouth.
I think that one's my favorite.
Why? -I don't know.
it's so...
so clear.
let's go. -Wait. I wanna buy a few things.
some towels.
well, buy me one too, for my head.
could I help you, madam? -Yes, please. I want six of these.
you'll take them with you? -No, COD.
name? -Gladys Glover, G-L-O-V-E-R.
address? -262 West
what? -262
did you say Gladys Glover? -That's right.
are you her? Yourself? -That's right.
well, for heaven's sake. -Why?
well, we were wondering all last week about that.
miss Glover, would you mind? -What?
would you mind signing this for my little niece?
she collects them. She'll get the biggest kick.
Harold! Guess who this is. -Yes?
I give up. -It's Gladys Glover.
no kidding. -Why should l?
who? -Don't know, dear.
Gladys Glover. -Oh? Who's she?
see? -My, my.
she gave me her autograph, Harold.
would you mind? -Of course not.
me too.
would you sign here? -Will you sign this?
who is it? -I don't know.
please, Gladys, let me have your autograph.
you got a pencil I can borrow for a minute?
I must get her autograph.
Hey, quit shoving. I was here before you!
me next, Gladys.
do you mind, Miss Glover, signing my book?
who is it? -Nobody, believe me.
St. Louis 11, Philadelphia 8. Now for the National League.
there were only three games today.
Philadelphia at Milwaukee was rained out.
the Giants defeated Chicago 5 to 3.
Cincinnati beat St. Louis 10 to 9. Brooklyn...
three days more...
...and I'm nobody again.
Yeah, but I'll show you how to enjoy that.
if I only had the money.
it isn't a question of money, believe me.
I could have been on the covers of matchboxes, pencils...
...anything you can think of.
we're gonna have a long talk in a few days, Gladys.
in fact, several other talks.
ln fact, we may end up talking-- -What about?
what do you think? -Why not now?
because this is important.
and I've got to wait till I'm sure...
...that your ears and eyes and your everything...
...are just a little more ready to-- Well...
Gladys Glover. -Yeah?
Gladys Glover.
Gladys Glover.
Gladys Glover.
mean anything to you?
he's talking about me.
well, it's the subject for your Manhattan Nightcap for tonight.
new Yorkers are speculating as to the answer...
... to one of the most unimportant questions of the day.
namely, who or what is Gladys Glover?
did you hear that?
signs bearing this mysterious name are appearing all over our town.
but it's this department's guess that Gladys Glover...
...is a second cousin to the famous Kilroy.
that's 30 for tonight, friends. See you tomorrow.
good show tonight, Brod. -Naturally, thanks.
telephone, Brod.
yeah? Speaking.
who? Oh, can it. Who is this?
what?
it is?
Gladys Glover in person.
well, insulting in what way?
well, now, you can't blame folks for wondering, now, can you?
say, where are you anyway, and how long you gonna be there?
no, I just wanted to get the rest of the story.
Yeah, fine.
I'll be right down.
Gladys Glover?
the mystery woman!
correction. For "mystery woman" reads "screwball.
I'll let you know.
keep going, sweetie. -Well, that's about all.
except I was telling Pete...
...if I had money, I could've made myself...
...into one of the most well-known people around.
let me ask you something, Glover.
what if I could plant you around a few spots? You know, radio, TV.
would you do it? -Do what?
go on. -Yeah, but do what once I'm on?
look, Gladys-- -I don't know.
maybe just tell your story. It's funny.
funny? -Well, fascinating.
I might get scared? -No, you wouldn't get scared.
I think so. I better not. -Yeah, that's right.
might be some cash in it.
there would?
might. Of course, I'd expect my cut.
Oh, sure. Why not?
you're not hooked up in any way?
how do you mean?
well, like engaged or engaged to be engaged.
look, mister-- -Wait a second. Why?
I was just thinking, there's this TV turn.
they call it Man and Wife. You get married on the program.
I understand it's quite a haul. -Really?
what are you looking at? -I don't know.
Gladys, please don't get mixed up in anything more.
you wanna turn into a freak? How do you--?
there's The People Speak. They're looking for goofballs.
you hear? You're a goofball. -Now, that's just a figure of speech.
I happen to know this fella who runs the program.
let me sound him, see what happens, okay?
go ahead, sound.
ladies and gentlemen, you have just heard the story...
...of three very great and very brave men.
and so another miracle is entered into the annals of exploration.
gentlemen, thank you for an inspiring story.
now? -When he gives you a wave.
and here she is, the gal who believes in signs.
come on.
everyone wants to be famous, don't you?
everyone would like to see their name in lights, wouldn't you?
but as Mark Twain once said about the weather:
everybody talks about it, but nobody does anything about it.
well, Gladys Glover is one girl who decided to do something about it.
but let's get her own story in her own words.
well, Gladys, how did you get this idea?
lt just came to me.
I was walking along, and I happened to feel on the blue side.
and I just lost my job, and I realized that I certainly was a failure.
and I realized how the whole reason I came to New York in the first place...
...was to see if I could not make a name for myself.
and time was going by, and I was not getting any younger.
and it looked like I never would. And so then I saw this big
and then what happened?
and so then I saw this big sign up there on Columbus Circle.
and all of a sudden, I seemed to see my name on it.
that's happened to many of us, I'm sure.
Oh, yes.
and so then l...
...began to wonder how much it would cost.
so I went down and asked the man, and this is how it started.
I was in a store and somebody who saw my sign asked for my autograph.
that was some thrill, and this is too.
you mean, being with us on The People Speak?
that's right. Some thrill.
thank you, Gladys Glover.
and another thrill is I'm gonna get paid for it too.
indeed you are. Indeed you are.
do you mind telling us what you're gonna do with the money?
I'm gonna rent a lot more signs and put my name on them.
thank you very much.
she's all yours, man. -You were great, honey.
just do that all the time. Just say whatever comes into your head.
okay, whatever.
so the real value of discussion, say, on a program like this...
...or this sort, for example, is the point of view...
all she's got is nerve, far as I can see.
maybe that's all you need nowadays. Four programs in one week.
she's making a name for herself.
well, to get back to our topic:
at what age should a girl marry?
it seems to me, Dr. Manning, that it's very dangerous to generalize.
we have found now after many, many years
I quite agree with Ilka.
I know lots of girls who've been married at 1 6, and very happily too.
well, statistics show us that an early marriage
Connie, for a certain type, maturity is terribly important.
if you consider-- -Gladys, what do you think?
well...
I think, if they're big enough, they're old enough.
but, now, seriously, Dr. Manning.
don't you feel that the laws governing this whole matter...
...are very outmoded? -If you mean
of course, Ilka.
most of them were written too long ago.
and by men.
then, of course, there is the whole question of the parents' consent.
to do what?
may I just read--? -I'm terribly sorry. Our time is up.
good night, and thank you so much, Dr. Manning.
this is Ilka Chase saying good night.
give me a double. -A double what?
a double anything. What do I care?
anybody suggested to me that this Gladys Glover thing...
...was gonna mushroom like this, I wouldn't have believed it.
that's just the point.
we're more or less responsible for starting the whole promotion.
so why don't we get the benefit of it? -What's the angle?
the average American girl.
there's a lot of penetration there.
something the customer can identify with.
right. It's a whole new approach to the endorsement angle.
who endorses products now?
movie stars, opera singers, debutantes, six-day bicycle riders.
the whole thing's been done to death.
how's this?
stars use it. Celebrities too.
but more important...
...It's the favorite of average American girls such as Miss Gladys Glover.
I don't think she's so average. -Why not?
because she's unusual. -That's what you don't seem to realize.
what?
the average American girl is unusual.
how's that again? -Exactly.
he's got something there, B. P. -Wait a minute. Wait.
I see a big campaign...
...with photographs by, say, Con Cooley.
that's enough.
that's it.
not too languorous. Now, give us a smile.
keep it "Glover." That's it. Good, good. Hold it.
now, let's have the pose.
now, let's have the smile.
that's good. That's fine. Plenty of movement now.
that's it. Winter sports! Smile again.
enjoy yourself. Relax.
all right! Now, don't get excited. Take it easy.
is she all right? Is she all right?
okay, babe? You're all right. Don't be nervous.
everything is fine. You can't fall.
that's a girl. All right, let's go, fellas. Come on.
you all right, Con? -Smile.
smile, now. That's a girl. Plenty of movement. Come on. Enjoy yourself.
smile. Now, let's make this a good one.
fine, fine. Come on, smile.
come on, Gladys! Look lovable!
I'm pooped.
you know how much you earned today?
what's the difference? I'm too tired to count it.
what you need is a nice, long, cool drink.
or a nice, long, cool sleep would be better still.
how would it be if we stopped up at my place?
I don't know. How would it be? -Excellent.
I get a wonderful breeze up there from the river. We could relax...
...talk things over. -What things?
Oh, different things.
different things from what?
as a matter of fact, there's something...
there's something important.
I ought to take it up with you tonight. It can't wait.
lt can't? -No.
it's about a big cross-country personal appearance tour that I had in mind.
for me? -That's right.
Oh, I can't tonight. I've got a date, sort of.
Oh, to do what?
to drive out to Westfield, New Jersey, and meet these certain people.
that's a big drive after a long day's work.
Yeah, but I promised this person to meet these people.
what about our conference?
you see, I'd have to go to the board first thing in the morning.
if I don't, it'll be another two weeks.
then it'll be too late.
too late for the cross-country appearance?
well, for the arrangements.
well...
...maybe I could ask. -That's the way.
imported.
that's right. -Great little car.
I like it. -I like it too.
something?
what's a car like this worth?
Oh, about 5000.
Why? Do you want to buy it? -Yes, I do.
only, I don't have 5000 on me just now, and I don't get paid until Friday.
that's too bad.
you wouldn't take $1 1 and about 30 cents? I do have that on me.
no. -I didn't think you would.
Hey, that's a nice shirt you got on. -What?
I don't wanna buy it. I just noticed it. -Thank you.
I'm a great friend of Gladys.
Oh, is that so? -Yes, it is so.
she's a fine girl, Gladys. -I'm not so sure.
no? -I'm still thinking it over.
there's quite a lot to her on the one hand, but on the other hand, no.
what did you say your name was? -I didn't say.
Sheppard. -Adams.
I know. You're the fellow she's working for.
well, I wouldn't put it that way. -Well, what way would you put it?
just trying to help her get what she seems to want.
how's is she making out? -Beautifully.
how are you making out?
I can't complain. -I can.
what? -You wanna hear me?
no, thank you.
well, goodbye and bad luck, Mr. Adams. I enjoyed our little chat.
thank you.
Yes, who is it? -Me.
I knocked at your door. I wanna see you.
well, you've already seen me. -What?
you saw me, but didn't notice. I was on the stoop. You went right by.
Oh, I'm sorry. -There's this fellow waiting downstairs.
I know. Could you do this? It's stuck again.
should I tell him to go? -Well, he's waiting for me.
he is? -That's one of the things...
...I wanted to tell you. We have to do the Westfield thing another time.
it's sort of business.
look, Gladys, any other kind of date, you wanna break it, okay.
but this has been set up for a week.
and when I go to the trouble of calling my mother, and she fixes us dinner...
...and my father probably even shaved.
maybe tomorrow night? -Dinner will be cold by then.
I feel just terrible. -You should!
I have to tonight, for the board of directors.
what? -A cross-country personal appearance.
I don't know what you're talking about, and neither do you!
please don't be nasty. I'm so tired.
you're not too tired to see junior down there.
listen, Pete, I'm over 21. -From the neck down, yeah.
all right!
can't you try and understand?
that's the whole trouble. I do. I wish I didn't.
but it's business! -What kind of business?
that's some fine question, I must say! -Then how about some fine answer?
go ahead, Gladys. Go ahead. These stairs are killing you.
there you are. -Yes.
you feeling better? -Much.
there's nothing like champagne.
Yes, there is. -What?
more champagne.
it's a very interesting thing I found out.
all these different things-- I mean, the expensive ones, like champagne...
...and thick steaks and silk stuff.
what I mean to say is, it's very easy to get into the habit.
but then you take, like, different things.
like, once when I was at a boarding house...
...they gave bean sandwiches for lunch. That's a habit I never got into.
hello.
what's this? -What's what?
this. -Nothing.
I thought it was something.
no.
that's not nothing.
you're very sweet.
so, what about this...
...cross-country...? -This what?
the personal appear
I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry! -Fine place for vintage champagne.
Oh, I'm sorry!
was that an accident, or did you do it on purpose?
I'll tell you the truth. I don't know.
you don't know?
everything is so sudden.
incident
incidentally, that chap I met outside your house earlier tonight.
what chap?
sheppard?
Oh, Pete.
he said his name was Sheppard. -That's right. Pete Sheppard.
what about him?
Oh, he works on movies.
documentaries.
very interesting.
is it anything?
is what?
you and he. -Oh, no.
Oh, no!
he's just sort of a neighbor.
in fact, he doesn't even like me.
in fact, more like hate.
Why?
well...
...not exactly hate.
we just think each other are wacky.
I suppose it's because we probably...
...don't understand each other. -But you and l...
...we understand each other.
don't we?
we do? -Of course we do.
that's nice.
that was all right.
thank you.
thank you.
you must be pretty experienced, huh?
in what way?
well, I mean...
...I guess you do quite a lot of this, don't you?
I suppose I do my share.
you just live here alone?
by yourself? -Yeah.
I suppose that's why.
Why?
you must be on the lonesome side.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
you ever think of getting a parrot?
a what?
that would be nice company.
somebody to talk to.
I mean, something.
and, of course, there's lots of parrots can talk.
so then you could be talking to it, and it could be talking to you, and...
I mean, you probably wouldn't be talking to each other, but it'd be talk.
I'd rather have you. -Than a parrot?
Yeah.
I think I better be going. -Why?
because I'm not enjoying myself. -Oh, give me time.
I don't mind the way you're acting, exactly.
what I mind is the way you give the idea you're sort of entitled.
maybe I am. -Oh, well, sure.
if you wanna make it into a sort of business proposition.
well, that's what you're doing, isn't it?
if you want true romance, missy, the magazines are full of it.
the way it looks to me, Mr. Adams, there are two kinds of people:
the ones who do anything to make a name for themselves.
and ones who'll do almost anything. -And which are you?
I'll let you know. -Now, wait a second.
no. You didn't really wanna have a conference.
least not the kind I thought.
you just said that. -But after all
in the second place, this is the most important thing...
...soon there will be ads and signs saying I'm the average American girl.
your idea, wasn't it? -Well?
well, I don't think the average American girl should do this.
so good night.
remember this day, Gladys?
that was the first time I saw you.
you hadn't met me yet, but you were about to.
and when I made that close-up, I had no idea...
...you were gonna turn out to be someone special.
but a few minutes later, at the time I shot this...
...I had decided I was gonna make a try with you.
this was right after I left you. I followed you.
and a few days later, I moved in, right into here...
...right across the hall from you, and lived here.
I wonder if you realize how tough it's been living across the hall from you.
and I suppose it's all right now to tell you...
... that I sure never did get much sleep.
it was quite an uncomfortable thing...
... to lie there in the dark, night after night...
...knowing that you were only a few steps away.
well, at first it wasn't so bad, because I had hopes...
... that the trouble I was having was only temporary.
I was confident that things would develop with us.
but as time has gone by, I've realized more and more...
... that this thing is just never gonna work out.
now, maybe I didn't handle it as well as I should have.
maybe all of those times that I got sore at you, you thought I really was.
but I wasn't, Gladys.
no?
what I was sore at was that crackbrained idea of yours...
... that seemed to be taking up all of your time, your energy and interest...
...and attention, so you had no time to concentrate on anything else!
