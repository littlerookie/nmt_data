hub, come back here and see who we brought.
uncle Garth! Kids, say hi to Uncle Garth!
we're here for a nice long visit.
the whole weekend. We know how Ionely our favorite uncles get.
who the hell are you?
Walter. - Walter?!
Mae's boy?
Pearl's daughter... that loose widow woman always running around.
it figures she'd muscle in. - Is Mae here?
how long are you here for?
well, we'll just see about that.
we know what you're up to.
don't think you're gonna get away with it.
come on, boys. Come on.
his momma's gonna be back before long.
Oh, that woman? Huh!
from what I hear, she may never come back. What then?
then you'd be stuck with him.
I'm telling you, take him to the orphanage right this minute.
whether we take him to the orphanage or tie him up and throw him in the lake, it's our business, not yours.
here he is now, spying!
Ow! Ow, ow!
see what I'm saying? Did you see what he just did?
Mmm-hmm.
fort Worth College of Court Reporting.
I need to find my mom. She's a student there.
I'm sorry, we're closed.
it's an emergency. Please?
her name's Mae... Mae Coleman.
um...
no, I'm sorry, there's no Mae Coleman registered here.
Oh! Try Mae Carter.
no, I'm sorry.
Mabel Cartwright?
mabe Calloway?
Donna Tompko?
young man, are you in some sort of trouble?
she's gotta be there! She just started.
listen, our classes started back in January.
no one could have possibly just started.
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
hub, I don't know why you have to drive. It's my car.
stop whining.
if we find the kid, he's gonna get a piece of my mind.
there he is.
lawyer, stay in the car!
hub, come on!
no, no. You, not me, no. - Hub!
get out of the car.
planning your next move?
where you figure on going?
here.
area code 406...
Montana.
how come you're not heading to Fort Worth where your momma is?
she's not there.
she lied...
again.
listen, kid, we know you got your heart set on going to Montana, but it's late.
hub, help me out here.
Why? It sounds like his mind's made up.
good luck in Montana, kid.
we've got better maps than that one at the house, right, Hub?
Yeah, a man needs a good map, that's for sure.
sure.
I've been to the orphan home before.
I don't want to go back.
damn it, kid, it ain't our fault you got a lousy damn mother.
guess I should get going.
which way is north?
I'll say one thing for this kid...
he sure pisses off the relatives.
listen, kid, do us a favor.
if you come back to the house and stay awhile, why, our relatives are gonna hate it.
I'll bet they hate it so much, they go away and leave us all the hell alone.
it's crazy enough it might work. - Sure.
come on, kid, help us out here.
I guess I could come back for a while, seeing it's so important.
so kid, how's that root beer?
uncle Hub, Uncle Garth, this has been such...
a wonderful weekend.
I hate to bring this up, but have you two looked at that will I left for you?
you both need to be thinking about these things at your age.
don't shoot! Don't shoot.
he's been here before.
brothers McCann?
this is no ordinary salesman.
hell, I like me a challenge.
can we talk?
come out where we can see you.
put down your guns and I'll come out.
this guy is good.
I'll cover, you sneak around.
...that's not complete.
what? What do you... what? What?
why not see what he's selling? - Let me just show it to you.
what the hell for? - It's right behind my car.
what's the good having money if you never spend it?
trust me. - It could be the kid has a point.
Yeah, well...
we'll see what the man's selling.
then we shoot him. - Good plan.
Whew!
due to the...
unsettling nature of our previous encounters...
I took it upon myself to search the world over for that...
that perfect item that'd be just right for two exuberant sportsmen such as yourselves.
and boys, well, I do believe I found it.
Voil√†!
what is it?
well, that right there is the sport of kings.
up till now, only heads of state have been able to afford a fine piece of equipment like that, and it is so simple to operate even this child could do it.
Really?
here. I'll tell you what...
you step right up here and chunk that lever back on my signal, okay?
go ahead.
Wow!
the most powerful one on the market, and very reasonably priced, I might add.
well, that is the biggest waste of money I have ever seen in my entire life.
mister, you load up that contraption and get the hell off this land.
we'll take it.
Oh no, you don't!
I won't have my children around this gun foolishness.
then leave!
come on, Daddy, let's go. - Come on. Come on.
you know what happens when my feelings get hurt.
get in the car. Get in the car.
pull!
pull!
pull!
uncle Hub? - Don't. I tried to wake him once.
he nearly tore my head off.
leave him for a few minutes.
what are you doing out here so late?
what's wrong with him?
well, a man's body may grow old, but inside his spirit can still be as young and restless as ever.
and him...
in his day, he had more spirit than 20 men.
it looks like...
he's looking for something.
Mm-hmm. - What?
he's looking for her.
who?
what was her name?
jasmine.
okay, tell me.
you want me to tell you the story?
now?
that would take days.
well, uh...
hub was always too restless for Texas.
he convinced our folks that he needed to go to Europe, and I needed to come along.
that was the summer of 1914.
I la-like you.
extra, extra! Germany invades!
unfortunately, just as we arrived in France, so did the Kaiser and the entire German Army.
I wanted to go home, but Hub said we should tour Europe one step ahead of the Germans.
and we did. What a time that was.
there were these girls in Toulon... twins. And they...
...anyway, we eventually wound up in Marseilles with passage booked on the last ship out of Europe.
and Hub, he decided that we should spend our last night enjoying the local nightlife.
three, three!
he made friends with these soldiers, and they bought us some drinks... strong, strange drinks.
we woke up on a ship bound for North Africa... shanghaied.
Shanghaied? - Yeah.
we found ourselves in the French Foreign Legion.
"it's all my fault," Hub said, but he told me not to worry.
he'd make sure nothing happened to me.
we fought many battles against overwhelming odds.
he saved my life countless times.
when the war was over, we both went our separate ways.
I ended up leading safaris mostly for writers and Hollywood folk.
but that was too tame for Hub.
he got commissions from the new North African governments, to put an end to the slave trade.
no one, slave trader or Bedouin, had ever seen anything like this mad American who fought like 20 men.
Hey!
what the hell are you two doing out here in the middle of the night?
just enjoying the cool night air.
either one of you got a lick of sense, go to bed.
dear Walter, how are you? Found your uncles' money yet?
here I am at school in Fort Worth, my nose to the court reporting grind...
damn it, brother, I'm not going anywhere looking like this.
look like a damn sharecropper.
we're gardeners. This is what gardeners wear.
I bought you some clothes too. They're in your room.
think how good all these vegetables are gonna taste.
peas, beans, squash, tomatoes.
Yeah. - What's this row?
beets. - Beets?
and what about this row?
potatoes. - Potatoes?
Yeah.
wait one damn minute here.
what's this row here? - Tomatoes.
tomatoes? - Yeah.
that's lettuce, squash, sweet potatoes, carrots, bok choy.
bok Choy? What is that? - Chinese cabbage.
Hey, that row looks right.
Yeah, well, this is corn!
all those seeds did look alike, come to think of it.
Yeah, like corn. - Boy...
that seed salesman sure saw us coming.
no, saw you coming.
corn, corn, corn!
nothing but corn.
corn. Corn.
by God, it's here! - Kid, help him unload.
we'll be right back.
careful, kid. He's a man-eater.
is this the McCann place? We brought your lion.
king of the beasts. Terror of the jungle.
you bought a lion? A used lion?
stand back, kid, you don't want to get mauled and eaten.
what are you doing? - Brother, this is the best idea you ever had.
this lion head will sure look good hanging over our fireplace.
what fireplace? You don't have a fireplace.
we'll buy one.
you're gonna shoot it?
well, be seeing you.
he's in there, all right.
I don't think this is very sporting.
kid, at our age, this is as sporting as we get.
Walter, come here.
when I give the word, pull this.
pull!
Hey.
come on out of there.
Hey, you in the crate!
get your lion butt out of there.
looks awful tame.
this lion's no good.
it's... it's defective.
it's alive, that's the main thing. - Go ahead and shoot it then.
no, it wouldn't be sporting, shooting it inside a crate.
looks kind of old...
worn-out looking.
some kind of lion hunt this is.
perfect. A reject.
some sick zoo castoff.
so can I keep him?
I'll look after him and take care of him and feed him and everything!
I never had a pet of my very own before.
so kid, you want to take care of it, nurse it back to health?
good. Then we shoot it.
that's some lion you bought.
that's some garden seeds you bought.
don't worry, they're not as bad as they seem right at first.
I'll be right back with supper.
there. Now you can see out.
you sure he can't get out?
she. It's a girl lion.
I named her Jasmine.
what did you just say?
it seemed like a good name... for a lion.
I'm sorry it took awhile to come in.
in 40 years, I never had a call for it.
purina Lion Chow.
I'll be!
if you wait a few minutes, my boys will load you up.
I got it.
Garth, pay the man.
be careful.
Mr. McCann, those are bags that weigh 50 pounds a piece.
take the other end.
here we go.
if you two old ladies want to get in, I'll take you home now.
Hub!
Psst!
Psst!
little boy!
you're with those McCann brothers?
I know that they're ex-mafia hit men.
they're on the run with millions that they stole from Al Capone.
tell me more about Africa...
about you and Uncle Hub and Jasmine.
why would a smart kid like you want to hear hokey old stories?
what else do we have to do?
where was I?
no one, slave trader or Bedouin, had ever seen anything like this mad American who fought like 20 men.
yeah right, right, right. Well, it so happened...
one of the women that Hub freed was handmaiden to a princess.
when she told her mistress the story of her rescue, most of all, she told her about the handsome, heroic American.
"I must meet this man!" The princess said.
one day, Hub was riding his horse along the Mediterranean, when out of nowhere, another rider came up alongside.
but you know Hub... he wasn't about to let a chance pass.
it became a race.
most people say that Hub was the best rider in North Africa.
but this other rider kept neck and neck as the race went on and on.
then the two horses collided.
the riders went flying into the sea.
hub leaped to his feet ready for anything...
or so he thought.
this was the princess, the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.
Jasmine! - Jasmine.
many people say there's no such thing nowadays, it's something you only find in stories, but when these two set eyes on each other for the first time, this was honest to god, no kidding, sure enough, once in a lifetime,
wait a minute. If it was true love they would've been married and lived happily ever after, right?
aren't you getting ahead of the story?
okay, keep going. - Well...
things weren't easy for them back then.
she was promised to another man, a powerful sheik in a neighboring kingdom.
he heard that Jasmine was in love with another, so he threatened her father, and took Jasmine off to his kingdom and locked her up in his harem.
she told the other wives that she would rather die.
she had a knife on her.
and when he came for her that night, she was going to slit her own throat.
what did Uncle Hub do?
they got married, and lived happily ever after.
the end.
but wait, if they lived happily ever after, then they got married, and she'd be here right now with us, right?
didn't they have kids? Where are they?
nurse? What's going on?
I wish they'd tell us something.
get out of my face!
Where'd you put my damn pants? Where's my pants?
you can't do that! - Gimme my pants!
who put me in here? Who put me in here? You two!
hospitals... lot of good they are.
how would you know? You're never in one long enough to find out.
Hey, you missed the turn.
I did not. - Home is that way.
I wanna go this way.
doctor, where is Mr. McCann?
Oh, I'm afraid he's gone.
well, he led a long full life.
where is the body?
no, he's gone... left.
Mr. McCann checked himself out.
left?!
brother, someday you're gonna have to start acting your age.
what the hell does that mean?
all your life, you've never been frightened of anything.
so what's eating at you now?
getting old?
dying? - Hell no.
what then? - Being useless.
when we were young there was always a reason, there was a point. Things made sense.
now there's no point to anything.
so what do we do? We garden.
we outlived our time, brother.
go get some beers. - All right.
Hey, old man, how's that barbecue?
give me some.
we're busy, boy. Get lost, all right?
what did you say?
here's a perfect example of what I've been talking about.
since this boy was suckling on his momma's tit, he's been given everything but discipline.
and now his idea of courage and manhood is to get together with a bunch of punk friends and ride around irritating folks...
too good natured to put a stop to it.
Hey, who do you think you are, huh?
just a dumb kid, Hub.
don't kill him. - Right.
I'm Hub McCann.
I fought in two World Wars and countless smaller ones on three continents.
I led thousands of men into battle with everything from horses and swords to artillery and tanks.
I've seen the headwaters of the Nile, and tribes of natives no white man had ever seen before.
I've won and lost a dozen fortunes, killed many men and loved only one woman with a passion a flea like you could never begin to understand.
that's who I am.
now, go home, boy!
we'll show these old bastards who's tough!
get out your knife. - Yeah.
now, boys, you're fixing to let those teenage hormones get you into a world of trouble.
damn it, Garth. Did I ask you to butt in?
hub, you just come out of the hospital.
well, there's... there's only four of 'em.
Yeah, but... look, you fight this one first.
and then I'll let you fight the other three after, okay?
Yeah. Watch this, kid!
now you! You better pick that knife up, 'cause, son, you're gonna need all the help you can get.
come on, Frankie! - Get him.
get him, Frankie, cut him!
Ahh!
shoot, oldest trick in the book.
okay, okay.
you hold it wrong, son. Not like this.
you always do it like this... smooth.
try it again. - Come on, Frankie.
come on, Frankie, get him!
cut him! - Come on. Okay.
get him, Frankie, cut him. - Yeah, you got him!
Frankie, come on!
stop, stop, ahh! - You're breaking his arm!
you three had better get in there and help him.
why aren't you helping him?
hub always hogs the bad guys. He's selfish that way.
but there's four of them!
three of them.
go on, Hub! Hey, there's my boy!
like this, kid? Pretty good, huh?
couldn't you share? - Nah.
after 40 years, I'm used to it.
Ahhh!
besides, right now, I figure he needs them worse than I do.
go on, Hub!
this'll hold him though. This'll hold him.
please! Please!
they're not back yet, Daddy.
I'm sure with Hub just out of the hospital, they're taking it slow and easy on the way home.
Yeah.
Oh, I hate this house. I hate it.
when those two finally drop dead,
I want you to burn this place to the ground, Daddy.
Hey, what's that?
beats me.
let's tear it up! - Yeah.
what is it?
it's stuffed!
mom! - Mom!
he's alive! - What? What happened?
I told you about those lies of yours. No!
Hey, don't step on my shoes!
what have you done with Uncle Hub?
kid, get some meat.
Where's Uncle Hub?
Oh, Lord, there's been an accident.
I wanna go home now.
you're in no shape to go home now.
it was a fight. Uncle Hub won. It was great.
Ahh! - The lion really did try to eat us.
shush. - Jasmine?
Oh Jasmine! I haven't fed her all day.
I bet she's really hungry. I got to go feed her.
here, here!
here you go, Jasmine.
Jasmine?
there really is a lion. - Lion?! You got a lion?
it's locked up. - No it isn't. It tried to eat us.
it really tried to eat us. - Get the guns!
get out of the way. - Get the guns.
come here, come here.
Jasmine?
Jasmine? Jasmine? Jasmine?
come on. Oh!
Eew, lion spit. No, stop.
don't shoot, you'll hit him.
come on. Whoa!
they're gone.
we might be too late. - Move in.
you stay. Stay.
Jasmine!
stop, stop.
attack him!
she's feeling a lot better.
get off of me!
we're leaving.
we are not coming back until you get rid of that monster.
well, the lion stays.
all right, that's it. Come on, Daddy.
daddy! Come on!
Bye, Uncle Hub. Bye, Uncle Garth!
shut up. Get in the car.
I need a drink. Bad. I'm having a bad day.
you boys hungry?
wanna stay for supper? - What are we gonna eat?
meat.
a lotta meat.
she won't come out of the cornfield.
this cornfield's the closest thing to a jungle she's ever seen.
she knows this is where she belongs.
I think she's happy. - I think she is.
what about you? You happy?
what's he saying to them?
he's giving them his "What every boy needs to know about being a man" speech.
a lot of men have heard that speech over the years.
a lot of men.
will he give that speech to me? - Oh, I guarantee it.
assuming he's still around, of course.
Hey, you didn't finish that story about Uncle Hub and Jasmine.
you don't believe all this Africa stuff?
it's a good story.
well, after he rescued Jasmine, several years passed, wonderful years.
never were two people so happy, so in love.
it was perfect.
except for one thing.
the sheik. - The sheik.
he hated Hub for stealing Jasmine, so he put a price on Hub's head.
10, 000 pieces of gold... a fortune.
assassins came from miles around.
come on!
he and Jasmine had to be on guard every minute of every day.
hub knew he and Jasmine couldn't run forever, that sooner or later their luck would run out.
there was only one thing to do.
so one day an assassin led Hub, bound in chains, into the sheik's fortress to claim his 10, 000 pieces of gold.
What?!
they gave the assassin bags and bags of gold as the sheik ordered Hub down to the notorious Dungeon of 1, 387 Tortures.
what kind of greedy, no-good scum would turn in Uncle Hub for money?
well, I would.
Ah, it was a trick.
Yeah, it was a trick.
in the dungeon, I drew my sword...
and single-handedly slaughtered everyone in there and freed Hub without dropping a single gold coin.
wait a minute, wait a minute.
you saved Uncle Hub, all this time carrying hundreds of pounds of gold?
you don't believe I killed all those men and saved Hub?
well, Hub might've helped just a little.
Uh-oh. - We were greatly outnumbered.
we fought against incredible odds.
and when it was over, we split up.
each one knew what the other had to do.
high in his opulent bedchamber, the sheik slept.
he awoke with Hub's sword across his throat.
the sheik was terrified, but Hub just lowered his blade.
"defend yourself!" Hub cried.
and he threw the sheik a sword.
the sheik knew that he would surely die now, without even the right to beg for mercy.
but Hub just said, "Twice I have held your life in my hands, and twice I have given it back to you."
the next time...
...your life is mine.
and from that moment on, the assassination attempts stopped.
some say it was because the sheik was afraid that Hub would return and kill him.
others said because Hub had spared his life, the sheik did the honorable thing and let his enemy live.
personally, I think it's because the sheik was so damn busy once they discovered oil in his kingdom.
he became one of the five richest men in the world.
What?! The bad guy gets filthy rich?
what the heck kind of story ends that way?
I just told it the way it happened.
Bye. - So long.
so that's how you got all your money?
the gold from the sheik? - Well...
Yeah.
those young men'll be okay now.
will you? - Yeah.
I feel old and worn out.
you've been busy. - Yeah.
terrorizing doctors and nurses, beating up teenagers, chasing after lions...
you've had a full day.
lucky those boys don't know diddly-squat about fighting.
won't be long till the kid here can whup my ass.
won't be long till I'll be helpless in a fight.
useless!
you'll feel better in a day or two.
Yeah, well...
I'm going to bed. Good night, kid.
so...
you finally gonna tell me what happened to Jasmine?
Nope. - What?!
you wanna know what happened to Jasmine you're gonna have to ask him.
ask Uncle Hub?
are you crazy? Look what happened last time.
I'm tired of doing all the dirty work around here.
if you wanna hear the end of this story, you're gonna have to ask him.
Hub? - Yeah?
an airplane? - Yep, always wanted one.
you always said you'd never set foot in an airplane.
you don't trust them to fall right out of the sky.
they're dangerous, all right, plenty dangerous.
you got a book of instructions or something?
Yeah, right here.
you don't know a damn thing about airplanes.
well, I'm gonna learn, I tell you.
Aha! It says right here, "To climb, pull back on the stick;
to descend, push forward on the stick."
I'll have this thing up in the air in no time.
Whoo! Damn.
maybe it's just a new hobby.
maybe he doesn't really mean to...
you know, do something crazy.
you think so?
you ask him yet?
about Jasmine?
you'd better make it quick.
what the hell?
it's the middle of the night.
what's the matter? What are you doing here?
you got something to say to me?
spit it out.
what happened to her, Uncle Hub?
what happened to Jasmine?
I have to know. I have to.
she died.
died in childbirth. Her and the baby.
what did you do?
went back to the only life I knew... back to the Legion.
for the next 40 years, there was always one more war to fight.
then I got old and came here.
here I am.
here I am.
you cold, son?
you'd better... here.
you'd better... you'd better go inside.
good boy, thank you. Good boy.
those stories about Africa...
about you...
they're true, aren't they?
doesn't matter. - It does too.
around my mom all I hear is lies. I don't know what to believe in.
if you want to believe in something, then believe in it.
just because something isn't true, no reason you can't believe in it.
all right.
there's a long speech I give to young men.
sounds like you need to hear a piece of it.
just a piece.
sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things that a man needs to believe in the most.
that people are basically good;
that honor...
courage and virtue mean everything;
that power and money, money and power mean nothing;
that good always triumphs over evil;
and I want you to remember this, that love...
true love never dies. You remember that, boy.
you remember that.
doesn't matter if it's true or not. You see, a man should believe in those things, because...
those are the things worth believing in.
got that?
that was a good speech.
think so? Thanks.
yeah...
when are you gonna give me the rest of the speech?
when you're almost a man.
you promise? - Wait one minute here. Wait...
I can't be a good man until you give me the rest of the speech, right?
you need to stick around until I'm old enough to hear the whole thing.
I see what you're trying to pull. - You have to stick around - until I'm old enough... - I'll write it down.
No! I want you to give me the speech!
you won't be living here then.
you're my uncle. I need you to stick around and be my uncle.
what about Uncle Garth?
he needs you.
W-what about the dogs and the pig, and the lion? We all need you. I need you.
no, you're just being silly. - No, it's true!
you're being silly. - It's true!
I know you miss Jasmine an awful, awful lot.
but if you go, we'll miss you just as much.
it's true.
all right, damn it, you win.
I'll stick around and be your damn uncle.
don't expect me to be happy about it.
all right? Deal?
Oh-hh!
Ohh, ohh.
you're a good boy.
you're a good boy. You're a good boy.
Walter, Walter!
get ready. Walter!
this money look stolen to you?
Oh, honey, you're so funny.
No!
whoop! - Oh!
shh, quiet!
mom! - Hi, honey.
Walter, Walter, this is Stan.
I've heard a lot about you, Walter.
your uncles still sleeping?
best not wake 'em up.
shh, come on. Wanna go sit down?
you got so big.
so Stan here is a detective.
a real private eye just like in the movies.
wow, really? - Sure, sure.
you wanna see my badge?
Stan works in Las Vegas. How about that?
what about court reporting school? - Oh, I had to quit.
Stan wants me to stay home and be a wife and mother.
won't that be wonderful?
I bet you found out where your uncles hid all that money, huh?
why do you want to know?
Walt, your uncles match the description of two bank robbers from the '20s and '30s.
no, you're wrong. - When Mae told me about them,
I got copies of the reports and showed them to her.
it's them, honey.
they used shotguns. They wore disguises.
they stole all that money. And they shot people...
innocent people.
no, not them. It can't be.
Stan knows what he's talking about, honey.
what about Jasmine?
she and Uncle Hub were in love. They...
I have her picture. - Honey, wasn't Jasmine the woman who was driving the getaway car?
Oh, right. - Oh, Jasmine...
she was wounded.
and they just drove off...
and left her for dead.
I know this hurts, son.
but they're criminals, and they lied to you.
my poor baby!
Oh, in the arms of vicious criminals.
we came just as soon as we found out.
we've come to take you away.
now, I want you to tell Stan where the money is, then we'll go pack your things, okay?
why do you need to know where the money is?
look at me, son.
because it doesn't belong to them.
it's stolen.
why, it's probably hidden right outside here somewhere, right?
close by?
I'll tell you what, why don't we take a little walk, huh?
show us around the place. What do you say?
let's go.
well, Walt, your mother and I found a nice house.
don't have enough money for the down payment though.
we could always turn your uncles in for the reward money, but they'd go to jail.
since all that money's stolen, honey, we got a right to it just as much as they do.
we'll have a nice family and nobody gets hurt.
isn't it wonderful, Walter? It's what we always wanted.
so where is it?
they're old, they're gonna die soon anyway.
you want Uncle Sam to end up with all that dough?
just tell us.
hub and Garth didn't rob any banks. They were in Africa.
Africa! Oh, Walter, be serious.
really! They were shanghaied into the Foreign Legion, and had adventures for 40 years. They couldn't have robbed any banks!
come on, pal. You don't believe all that, do you?
sure, I do! - You?! Mr. Doubting Thomas?
here Stan's got actual evidence and you believe that Africa crap?!
Yes. Yes, I do.
Mae, you should go wait on the porch.
we're gonna have a little chat, man to man.
why don't we talk in the barn? What do you say?
come on!
getting warmer? Huh?
no, let go!
let you and me get something straight.
we can be friends or we can be enemies.
I've had a run of crummy luck lately.
I know some bad people who want to cause a lot of trouble for me.
I need that money and I know it's close.
I'll be damned if some snot-nosed kid is gonna stand in my way.
so what's it gonna be, pal?
friends or enemies?
defend yourself.
huh?
where is it?!
Where's the money? Where is it?
where is it?
where is it?
tell me where it is!
tell me where it is!
where is it?!
I heard some noise.
Oh God!
Jasmine?
Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness! Stan!
it's dead.
Oh my God, he's dead! Stan's dead!
no, he'll live. I'm talking about the lion.
Oh!
we have to get him to the hospital. Mae, get your car.
I can't, I can't! - Mae, your car!
get it, get it! - Okay, okay.
let's get this lion off him. - Okay.
this man's gonna need some stitches.
a lotta damn stitches.
what happened to her?
it looks like her heart gave out in all the excitement.
Yeah. - She was plenty old, you know?
look...
I think she's smiling.
Yeah. I guess she died happy.
she died with her boots on, that's the main thing.
protecting her cub.
she was a real lion, wasn't she?
there at the end.
sure.
a real jungle lion.
a real Africa lion.
you finished packing?
your momma's gonna be back from the hospital soon.
you can wait for her on the front porch.
stay right here.
don't you move a muscle.
so you all packed? Where's your suitcase?
don't be fresh.
upstairs in my room. - Well, let's go get it.
howdy, Stan.
you know, you're lucky, Stan.
lucky that lion got to you before we did.
I wonder what your uncles are saying to Stan.
probably their "What every boy needs to know about being a man" speech.
well, I'm glad to see they're making friends.
so you all set?
let's go.
to make a long story short, Stan, you and me, we can be friends...
or we can be enemies.
well, boys, I hope Walter wasn't too much trouble.
we managed. - What's gonna happen to him?
a man like that's got no business being around your boy.
well, of course not. What kind of a mother would I be?
I'm gonna drop him off in Las Vegas.
l... I'll be back for the...
rest of that speech if...
I'll be here.
good boy.
thanks for the s-stories and everything. It... it...
it meant an...
an awful, awful lot.
I'm glad.
well, come on, honey. We're burning daylight.
damn.
she doesn't deserve that kid.
maybe we should get a lawyer.
no judge is gonna take a child away from its mother and give it to two old bachelor uncles.
maybe she'll sell him to us. How much money we got?
hub...
there's nothing we can do. He's gone.
so where are we going?
I told you, Las Vegas.
I mean after. After we drop Stan off.
well, honey, Stan's gonna need a lot of looking after.
Walter!
what are you doing?!
Oh my God!
Walter! Walter!
Walter, stop!
stop right there!
what's gotten into you?
Oh, honey, are you all right? You gave me a heart attack.
you're still marrying him after everything.
Oh, he's not so bad.
a little rough around the edges, but he can change.
mom!
he says he loves me.
has he hit you yet? - Mind your own business!
you always think a new boyfriend solves everything, but you always pick losers, and he's the worst of them all.
Walter, I had no choice.
maybe you don't.
what?
mom? - What?
do something for me.
for once.
do something that's best for me.
okay?
salesmen ought to be here in two, three hours.
Whoop-de-doo. - Uh-huh.
lookie yonder.
okay, if I'm gonna live here, there's gonna be some conditions.
conditions?
one, you two gotta stick around until I'm through with high school at least, preferably college.
you both got responsibilities now...
PTA, Boy Scouts, Little League, the works.
sounds like we don't have much choice.
two, you both gotta take better care of yourselves.
more vegetables, less meat.
I wonder if traveling salesmen sell school supplies?
and three, no more dangerous stuff.
no fighting teenagers, no airplanes...
now wait one minute...
at least till I'm through with college.
maybe longer. - What do you expect us to die of?
old age?
well...
welcome home.
Hello? - Walter?
yes? - This is Sheriff Grady.
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
it's about your two uncles.
I'm sorry, they passed away.
there was an accident...
and it's a blessing that they didn't suffer.
it's a blessing too, in a way, that they went together.
you understand.
I'm over here at your uncles' place now.
you need to come on over here.
you need to see this for yourself.
Walter? - How you doing?
all right.
best I can figure, they were trying to fly through that barn upside down.
had a bunch of reporters out here earlier, even CNN.
I guess any time a biplane...
from the First World War crashes doing acrobatics, being flown by two 90-year-old men...
neither one of them with pilot's licenses...
well...
well, they had a good long run, both of them.
they went out with their boots on.
here. I found their will.
the kid gets it all.
just plant us in the damn garden...
with the stupid lion.
Hey!
we've got some company.
this is it.
this is where they lived.
it's okay. Come here, buddy.
come here. Look at this.
look at this.
forgive me.
we were in Houston when we heard their names on the news, and, well, we just had to come.
when I was a boy, my grandfather told me such stories.
your grandfather? - A very wealthy sheik.
he used to love to tell me stories about his wild youth.
amazing, unbelievable stories all about two brothers,
hub and Garth McCann, the most valiant and brave men, huh?
he called them his "most honored adversaries."
the only men who ever outsmarted me.
wait, so you...
you knew these two men?
they... they raised me.
it's an honor.
nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.
Wow.
Aha.
I see they spent my grandfather's gold wisely.
Yeah.
well, there was this one traveling salesman.
so...
the two men from great grandfather's stories, they really lived?
yeah...
they really lived.

lots of snow!
terrific! Not melted yet!
we came for a memorial service. Not to go skiing.
mama, you also want to ski, right?
Oh, I want to ski! I'm dying to ski!
I can't wait to see Yoshimi.
spring vacation's great. No homework.
I thought you grew out of that.
my lucky charm.
it's so cute... Give it to me.
Nope.
look out!
Heisuke Sugita Naoko Monami
rescued passengers are badly injured.
most in critical condition.
the latest report...
regarding the mother and daughter in the hospital...
they have been identified as Mrs. Sugita and her daughter.
the two women brought to this hospital...
have been identified.
their family name is Sugita.
we'll be going now.
try to shave clean.
Bye, now!
I'm Sugita. Where's my wife and daughter?
Sugita? The trauma section upstairs.
the trauma section.
Heisuke!
I don't know what to say...
if only I hadn't asked them to come...
doctor, doctor...
Mr. Sugita?
Yes.
will they make it?
I'm afraid it's very critical.
you mean my wife... or my daughter?
both of them.
doctor, the mother's VF!
Bosumin!
hold on! What?
what?
Monami?
don't worry.
she's right next to you.
nurse... Help me.
Naoko!
hold on!
Naoko!
Naoko!
Naoko!
Naoko!
mama...
this way please.
Naoko...
Monami...
Monami.
you're awake...
what?
am I... dead?
Monami.
you're alive!
I'll get the doctor!
wait, Heisuke.
it's me, Naoko.
what?
what are you saying?
Monami.
Heisuke...
I'm Naoko.
H i m i t s u
what are you saying?
are you all right, Monami?
no. I'm Naoko.
can't you see?
No! It's impossible.
I can't believe it myself.
but it's true.
now, don't kid daddy.
I'm not.
no.
then, tell me about the first date we had.
we ate ice cream at the Cape Lighthouse.
and then?
we went to Chinatown.
you ate 5 dishes of noodles in soup.
different kinds of noodles.
also fried noodles.
and do you remember the night you spent at my place?
Yes,
it was winter.
while we were doing it you were so clumsy.
you had a leg cramp. A big commotion.
tell me, are you still alive?
Naoko...
Naoko?
does it mean that Monami is the one who is dead?
I took over Monami's body.
if it's possible to bring Monami back...
I'll do whatever it takes.
for now...Better not tell anyone.
Heisuke...
what'll I do now?
I'm home.
wow, what a mess.
Heisuke, open the window.
it's pretty awkward.
Heisuke, did you water them?
sometimes.
I knew it.
they're withering. The poor things.
drink lots of water.
there!
come on, pep up!
now you'll revive.
Heisuke, come and help me.
Heisuke...
am I in a dream?
will you be all right alone?
I'll be fine.
you missed some.
so, you're Naoko.
see you later.
I'll see you later.
a little bland.
but chief, we thought a mild flavor would sell better.
chinese noodles must taste good from the first bite.
so- Called mild soy sauce contains a lot of salt.
yes...
it has a good broth flavor.
a little more effort.
and the noodles.
I'm confident of that.
I think the chief looks pretty weary.
after what happened, of course.
come on! Get up! You'll be late.
5 more minutes.
No! Get up!
No! I want to sleep more
get up right now. You hear me?
stop it!
I'll sleep with you.
research of possession phenomenon, by religion, natural science and psychology, continues extensively...
there is an interesting case.
it happened to a girl in France.
she had smallpox...
and was in a state of suspended death...
she recovered with another person's personality.
a woman who died at about the same time,
was believed to have possessed the girl.
it's green! Look! Look!
the girl knew everything about the dead woman.
her condition lasted for two years.
then, the girl's true personality returned.
I'm home.
she must be Naoko
Monami...
it's me, Naoko.
Hi, there.
what in the...?
look like a teenager?
maybe the skirt is too short?
no...
stop staring, Heisuke.
cut it out!
I can't help it.
Heisuke!
stop it...
Heisuke.
you know what I think?
I should be Monami when we're outside the house.
it's an idea...
we don't have a choice.
being your wife in the house won't change.
right.
I can't keep wearing this ring.
from now on this will be my wedding ring
I'll keep mine on.
that's nice of you.
but...
you're over 40, can you be a high school girl?
I can... I can!
that's already out of date.
you've got to get busy with a lot of catching up.
now, go to sleep.
we're a real weird couple.
Ah, shut up.
this sure brings back memories.
Monami!
why, hello.
are you all right now?
Kuniko?
gee, you grew up.
same class?
what's with your skirt?
what?
it's too long.
are you feeling better? Just take it easy, okay?
smile.
Yeah, thanks.
let's go.
she's gone through this terrible trauma...
she forgets faces and names.
I see she might find it very hard to keep up in class.
a new term is starting.
she's a good student. She'll be fine.
no, I don't really think so.
I'm sure she can't even socialize with anyone.
don't worry about her in school.
yes...
good morning.
Monami!
you're... Odajima, right?
Ah, yes.
I'm glad you're with us.
me too.
I sure am glad.
why'd you bother with him?
he was a classmate before.
so, you talked to him?
could you ignore him?
I guess not.
Monami!
long time no see.
the second function...
F equals...
a x squared plus...
b x plus c...
find the value of the constant a, b, c.
I give up.
help me, Monami.
anyone have the answer?
miss Sugita.
you mean... me?
Yes.
I'll wash your back.
no thanks.
Why?
it's just...
come on, I always do.
Yeah, right.
you're Naoko, yeah.
how's school?
exhausting.
kids are all around me.
that's natural.
something's weird.
what?
I thought math was beyond me completely,
but it's easy to come up with answers.
the conscious mind is yours, but the brain is Monami's.
the brain determines talent and ability.
you and Monami have the same thought patterns.
maybe that's it.
finished.
get in the tub.
Thanks.
Hey!
don't be shy.
cut it out.
regarding indemnity...
depending on the victim's sex and age...
the sum will differ from 50 to 80 million yen.
can't you get at least 100 million?
that's too cheap.
is life that cheap?
give my son back!
all of you have a document...
that calculates the formula for indemnity.
you apply it to figure out the amount.
so, the amount can be roughly decided.
my two sons who just started work were killed.
they're not the same as somebody's wife.
200 million yen each!
well...
do you know the cause of the accident?
Yes.
the bus company admits it was the driver's fault.
after a thorough inquiry?
it won't bring back the dead!
demand a thorough check of the accident.
it's what the people who died want to know.
very well.
the issue of overwork of the driver...
and other factors to be double checked.
will be demanded from the bus company.
please do that.
I will.
money is the least concern.
it's not the money...
one more thing.
the driver's son, Kajikawa, is here.
he wishes to make an apology to everyone.
is it all right?
then, Kajikawa, please.
please accept...
I'm sorry...
that's no way to apologize.
how many people are dead?
be more sincere.
who do you think you are?
your father did it!
my dad's not a murderer!
what's that?
come back here!
wait a minute.
you were pretty rude.
he's the one.
he calls every night.
saying my dad's a murderer.
I recognize his voice.
no compassion for the victim's families?
I feel sorry for them.
for you too.
but my dad didn't cause the accident on purpose.
the bus company puts all the blame on him.
you have other family?
no. That's why I came.
wait...
he has an attitude.
he's having a hard time.
he's going to college?
who knows?
if he worked overtime for the tuition...
the victims can't rest in peace.
who worked overtime?
the driver.
I heard him talking on the bus.
Kajikawa, it's your turn.
Yeah, sorry.
are you all right?
I didn't sleep last night.
driving a truck again?
you're risking your job.
but driving is the only work I can do.
isn't moonlighting hard?
not too bad.
it means happiness to my family. That's what.
maybe he dozed off at the wheel.
I'll do the indemnity negotiations.
so, forget about the accident.
Monami!
pass it on!
pass! Pass the ball!
miss Sugita.
Yes.
catch you later.
how do you feel?
I'm fine.
take care of yourself.
Yes.
that girl's worrying about me makes me tired.
don't be ungrateful. She's a fine teacher.
you're taking her side.
silly.
but you know...
she's always watching me.
it suffocates me. Maybe she's suspicious.
about what?
that I'm not Monami.
silly. She's worried about you, that's all.
that sure is a pretty heavy meal.
I want to eat solid food, 'cause I'm young.
young. I see.
Heisuke, what about it?
what?
sex.
Heisuke, shame on you.
why sex, out of the blue?
well, we talked about my teacher, Miss Hashimoto.
that's irrelevant.
well, what'll you do?
what'll I do?
what can I do?
to my own daughter?
you think I can make love?
I guess not.
Mr. Sugita?
yes?
it's been a while.
Yes, it has...
a medical school?
Yes.
it will be hard on her, changing her subjects.
why in the world?
you have any inkling?
no.
shall we sit down?
thank you.
I didn't know we were neighbors.
I live further down the road.
alone?
Yes, that's right.
is that so...
well, now...
what's she up to with Heisuke?
well, I must be going.
thank you.
say hello to Monami.
Yes.
good- Bye.
I caught you.
you startled me. Were you listening?
wipe off the grin.
who, me?
she's your type all right.
what's that mean?
you're nuts!
Ouch! Ouch! . Ouch!
I want to study cerebral medicine.
I want to discover what happened to me.
I thought so.
but can science cure it?
maybe not, but I want to try.
just living and feeling skeptical isn't easy.
I guess not.
one other thing...I don't want to waste reliving a life.
with Monami's body, I want to do what I want.
for Monami's sake too.
I feel like I'm being outstripped.
no good?
I'll back you up.
I can still work for 20 more years.
Hey!
what?
is your skirt shorter?
this is normal.
come on. You're over forty.
you hear? Naoko!
Naoko?
famous foreign literature,
Tolstoi, "War and Peace."
Hey.
Naoko!
look! Look!
Hey!
Naoko!
be quiet!
I'm starving!
lots of pickles,
here! Here!
not me!
so, the test is tomorrow.
no problem.
that's good.
here's something we put all our energy in.
please.
concentration
if you don't pass, there's always next year.
and another year afterwards.
if I didn't pass, then no one passed.
you're amazing.
look! There it is!
where? Where?
7 0 5 Na- O-ko!
Oh, I see it.
thanks to my noodle power.
yes? Yes!
one order of Sushi.
right!
we haven't been here for awhile.
Yeah.
here...
it's my happiest time to be with you like this.
Yes, it is.
say, Heisuke.
if you fancy that girl...
girl?
the teacher, Taeko Hashimoto.
that kid, Taeko?
now's the time to make a move.
I've got you, Naoko.
thank you.
you missed some.
cut it out.
here. Herring.
you all right? Here...
it might help if I hide my face.
and I'll be quiet.
it just isn't right to do it to Monami's body.
I can use my mouth.
don't say that with Monami's face.
all right.
Well...I'll sleep in Monami's room from tomorrow.
I guess you should.
maybe we should have done that sooner.
can I sleep here just for tonight?
Yeah.
for Monami's entering medical college!
bottoms up!
Congratulations!
daddy! Hurry up and come here!
here.
I promised Monami before.
right?
you said you wanted to eat grandpa's noodles.
Oh, yes, I was dying for it. and I love this.
Yes, yes!
delicious.
I'm sorry.
my mother really loved grandpa's noodles.
tasty!
really good.
Monami, do you have a boyfriend?
why...
no way!
why not?
over my dead body.
that's 'father- Talk', Heisuke.
she'll find a nice guy and get married before you know it.
the day you got married to Naoko...
our dad cried his eyes out.
he said he wanted to hit you, Heisuke.
nonsense.
but you cried.
that never happened.
he really said that.
Where's your dad?
in the bath.
that's nice.
it feels stiff here.
you can tell?
Yeah, dad, you always feel stiff right here...
what?
I mean, my dad gets a stiff back too.
he does?
you rub his back too like a good girl.
Monami.
yes?
you've grown up now.
so, if your dad finds a suitable lady...
let's give him our blessing, all right?
Yeah.
Monami... I wonder where she is now?
damn it all!
damn it!
thank you for waiting. This way please.
here's the menu. Please take you time.
I'll be back in a moment.
welcome. How many in the party?
Ah, just a second.
what the...?
what's wrong?
guess I lost my wallet.
come on, dad, you've got to watch over me.
I'll pay.
all right?
thank you.
all right?
Thanks.
Heisuke...
it can happen to anyone.
Hi.
hello.
the money I owe you.
you came all the way here to pay me back? Come in.
I've got to go.
thanks anyway
thank you.
are you getting worker's compensation?
no.
the company found out dad was moonlighting.
I see... And how about your college?
I quit.
I got a job in a noodle shop.
you did? Where?
in Yotsuya.
Yotsuya? That's near my company.
do you know the "Kouya"?
Yes, it's catty- Corner from a sushi shop.
and the "Avalanche" noodle shop nearby...
you wanted to know the cause of the accident.
I think my dad dozed off while driving.
he was working recklessly.
and it was all for you.
maybe.
our life was never easy.
maybe he had a gambling debt.
he liked to gamble.
what sick people need, is not famous scholars.
they need good clinicians.
this is the basic doctrine of our school.
never let it fade from your mind...
during the 6 years you will study here.
for the many patients and their families you'll meet,
do become good doctors.
join the sailboat club?
I'll be busy studying.
anyone who only studies won't make a good doctor.
physical stamina is vital for doctors.
well... No thank you.
doctors need stamina!
one two! One two!
doctors need stamina!
one two! One two!
I'm scared!
Sugita! Pull!
pull!
pull the jib!
stay cool!
stay put!
look forward!
let go of the jib!
loosen the sheet!
don't stand up!
we'll capsize!
stay cool!
I'm trying my best!
sailboats?
stamina is vital for doctors.
risky?
they're all experts.
and they are... men?
a German farmer wanted to hunt badgers.
so, they crossed a dog with a strong jaw and...
a dog with short legs, and that made dachshunds.
all right, let's do this thing.
transfers confirmed.
move in. -That's very good.
this is the FBI.
the building is surrounded. You 're all under arrest.
I repeat, you 're all under arrest.
put your hands up.
this is the FBI!
Sonny Talia, you're under arrest.
Oh, yeah? For what? Import/export?
calm down, buddy. Here's my bill of lading.
coffee, paint, computer chips and lawn chairs.
there's nothing in here but lawn chairs.
Hey, sweetheart, you're a beautiful girl.
if you get tired of the FBl...
...you can come and work for me in one of my dance joints.
bring in Agent 11!
agent 11...

Bleeker Street. Dog Town.
no, you don't. No, you don't.
come on, Spike. Can't we do this nice, just once?
all right. You asked for it.
what do we got here? Go get the chicken.
go get the chicken.
psych, Spike!
come on, Boodles.
we gotta stop meeting like this. I'm telling you.
it costs me 20 bucks a week in meatballs.
let's do it again. Go get the meatball!
where are you? Where is that stinking dog?
well, well, well.
what's up, Tyson? You on lock-down?
want to get the mail? Want to get the mailman? Come on, try!
too fast!
who am l? MC Hammer! You know why? Because you can't touch this.
not today, Tyson!
here you are, baby. Signed, sealed, delivered.
thank you, Benny. I'll see you tomorrow?
Oh, yeah. And remember, if there's anything I can do for you...
...all you have to do is raise that flag...
...and I'll come through for you, baby. Rain, sleet or snow.
this postman always delivers.
damn.
Oh, hey, Gordon. What's up, man? you're looking smooth, brother.
Tyson again?
Yeah, but l'm cool.
that dog's on an all-white-meat diet. He never did that to no brother.
that's not funny. -Yes, it is.
why don't you request a different route if he's giving you a hard time?
there's not a dog on this planet that can scare me.
okay, brother.
that's funny. That's hysterical.
come on, baby. They're just jokes.
don't get postal on me.
postal? I' m not postal.
don't even play with me like that. You know all white people are crazy.
I'll check you back at the crib.
Hey, G. You can keep that dog, dog.
get it, dog?
here's some good news, Mr. Talia.
the metal ball bearing we inserted to replace your missing appendage...
...should help you maintain a natural appearance.
luckily we were able to save the other one...
...or else we'd have to put in two, and when you walk...
it's just a little urological humor.
Sonny, let it go, please! Listen, Sonny, it's okay.
the prosecution has absolutely nothing on you.
you're a businessman with a valid bill of lading for importation.
they can't prove prior knowledge or possession.
they got no case!
I'm not worried about that right now.
what I'm worried about is this Agent 11 dog. It's always this dog.
he made me lose 22 million dollars in the last three years.
and now he made me lose, he made me...
you know, Sonny, you only need one.
then give me one of yours. -Just looking on the bright side.
you can't do anything about the dog. -Yes, I can.
man's best friend. Bad dog!
I'm sorry, buddy.
Hey, baby.
Steph, someone has mailed you a stuffed dog.
Rick, the shoot for Slick and Slimy is down the hall.
Gordon! -Hey, Steph.
this isn't a good time for me right now.
I got James a little present here.
Oh, my God, that's so sweet. All he's been talking about is dogs.
he doesn't understand you can't have one in an apartment.
honey, come here. Gordon's got something for you.
what's up, little man? Look what Uncle Gordon got you!
I'm not really your uncle, so if I kiss your mom...
...that's okay.
don't worry, James. There's no chance of that happening.
Hey, pal, what do we say?
thank you.
I like dogs. I' m gonna keep you for a long time.
yo, Steph. This guy's whack.
hello. Yeah, Daisy? Flight's at 9.
you waltz in here with that toy...
...thinking you can buy back Stephanie through her son?
you're mad you didn't think of it first.
I don't have to. I'm here because she wants a real man around the house.
are you gonna go arrest one and bring him home to her?
okay, guys.
police business. I gotta go.
I'll show you to the door.
all right, bye now. Take care. Don't get shot.
out. -What?
out. Now. Go. -Come on, Steph.
Oh, Steph. You can't fight it, baby.
I' m cool.
don't even start.
you need some handcuffs instead of them stamps. Rick got them.
look, G, l'm feeling you, man. Stephanie's a dime.
a dime? What's that mean?
a ten.
but she comes with carry-on.
the kid.
what's your point?
it's like you're dating Janet, but Janet's bringing Tito.
you don't want that!
we're just friends. I'm giving her advice on her love life.
Love-life advice? She'd be better off calling the Psychic Friends Network.
if you want to get with that mommy, you got to be a poppy.
are you ready for that? -No!
I'm cool with my current responsibilities, thank you.
like what?
remembering to floss.
feeding my fish.
and, at some point, returning The Matrix video to Blockbuster.
a kid abandoned in a mailbox should jump at the chance...
...to screw up a family of his own. -You have to bring that up?
Yeah, I have to bring that up, man! What the--?
didn't your foster parents teach you to respect other people's property?
the last time I sat on this couch, my butt was orange for a week.
take your dang couch out of here. I didn't want it in the first place.
I don't have space for it.
I'm teaching yoga in the front room.
I don't want to hear about you teaching yoga.
you don't even know one yoga move.
I can pick a five-dollar bill up with my butt.
you cannot. -Give me five dollars.
I want to see this.
you're gonna see it, baby. you're gonna see it.
watch this.
okay.
all right, l'm stuck.
you all right? -Just come push me over. Push me.
just push me. Just push me to the right.
Hey, hey, watch the couch, baby.
all right, come on, man.
Yes, l'm gonna watch football. -You know l'm ready!
Yeah, l'm gonna watch some football!
miss Maguire, I have people here. You must come down now.
miss Maguire, I have people here. You must come down now.
Hey, what are you yelling about?
you tell her to come down now, because we are leaving to the airport.
she's so slow.
where you going, man? -Nowhere, man.
Hey, man! Gordon! Yo, yo!
do you mind?
you can't take care of the hamster I gave you.
what you gonna do with a woman? -Come on, man, let me do this.
go handle your business then.
what's up, Steph?
I' m going away on business and the babysitter's late.
she said she'd be here in ten minutes, 30 minutes ago.
okay, calm down. It's okay. Super G's here.
Oh, God, I hope this is you, Daisy.
Hello? Daisy!
you'll be here in ten minutes? If you don't get here, I'll miss my plane!
I'll watch James until Daisy gets here.
I don't think that's
Daisy! Yeah, it's Gordon.
get your butt over here, girl, fast!
there you go.
this isn't a good idea. You don't know anything about children.
it's ten minutes. What's he going to do, dry out?
come on, we'll kick back, have a couple of beers, huh?
okay, one beer.
you got business to take care of. Just relax, it's gonna be fine.
I'll keep an eye on James and James'll keep an eye on me.
Daisy is on her way, so Gordon's gonna watch you for a few minutes.
are you okay with that?
let's go! -Okay, okay.
move it! Move it now!
this is important. Remind Daisy to always check the food pyramid.
this is a list of what he can watch and when, only an hour a day, no PG.
no video games, all right?
Oh, and you've got to make sure that she takes him to piano and soccer.
look, it's all in the schedule.
all the shaded green areas are all free-play time.
Daisy knows all this, right? She's been watching him for two years.
right. You're right. Okay.
mommy will be home tomorrow, and when Mommy's away who do we listen to?
Daisy. -Right. And remember, follow...
follow the rules and playtime will follow.
got it.
I love you.
Gordon, you're a lifesaver. -Yeah, all five flavors.
all people waiting for you!
don't make smoochie-smoochie. Everybody, put on seat belts!
all right, there it goes! Run, baby, run!
knock him on his ass!
my bad. Knock him to the asphalt!
knock him to the asphalt!
I hope the babysitter gets here soon so we can go to the big screen.
I know.
Hello? Daisy, yeah, it's Gordon. Where are you?
what do you mean, you can't come?
the game's on. Get your butt over here.
food poisoning?
Daisy, listen, you can have food poisoning over here...
...with James.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I don't think she's coming.
don't worry.
your mom'll be back tomorrow, and Benny will hang with us.
you're hanging yourself fine.
remember, if he gets scared, cries...
...or messes his drawers, give me a call.
Benny, he's gonna be fine.
I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to him.
James, if he goes to the bathroom longer than five minutes...
...Iight a match.
I'll be watching the big screen! you're on your own, dog!
that ain't funny. Benny!
I' m hungry.
good. Okay, food, I could do that.
come on, kid. -I can't have breakfast now.
why not? -It's dinnertime.
so?
I don't know about this.
doesn't your mommy make you clean?
occasionally, I take a flamethrower to it and start all over again.
what's that smell?
that's the smell of a man.
it's what a man's place smells like.
but listen. Come over here.
we gotta go over some rules here. Listen carefully.
this is my stuff.
look at it.
it's beautiful. It's 500 watts of Dolby digital sound.
stereo, receiver, DVD player. The tower of power!
check it out.
don't touch it.
you hear that? Can you feel it, baby?!
say, "Don't touch Gordon's stuff. " -Don't touch Gordon's stuff.
we're gonna get along just fine.
here we go.
some natural whole-bran cereal, just like the chart says...
...and some soy milk.
hold it now, hold it now.
can't forget your prunes.
all right, dig in.
your mom ever say anything about me? -I heard her with Daisy.
listening in to your mom's conversations, huh? That's good.
What'd she say? -She said that you're funny.
funny? Funny, that's good.
Yeah, we like funny.
what else? -That you're irresponsible.
irresponsible?
irresponsible, waste your time...
...and you only want one thing.
Oh, and you're some kind of hound.
she said that?
what's she got you eating here?
it's good.
how can you eat that?
"no sugar added"? And They're proud of that?
I want to tell you about this man I know. His name's Cap'n Crunch.
he's got some friends too.
count Chocula and Toucan Sam.
Froot Loops.
I' m not allowed.
wait, wait. You see, the warden's away.
just us guys here. We hunt, we gather, we eat what we want.
what if my mom finds out?
I won't tell if you don't.
I see it says I shouldn't have given you sugar.
those are live animals!
catch me!
I want this Agent 11 taken out.
I don't know. An FBl agent could be a little tricky.
this guy is huge!
not him, you moron. The dog. Agent 11 is a dog.
that's funny. That's a good one, Sonny. That's a good one.
you want we should whack a dog?
you two tubs of blubber think that's funny?
there's no reason to get personal. -This is personal!
it don't get no more personal! I want the dog dead!
all right, all right, Sonny.
but, you know, we're pros.
how we gonna hold our heads up in the community...
...with people knowing we' re going around to put the whack on a pooch?
I mean, we got an image.
if the two of youse don't whack this pooch...
...then you will get whacked.
okay. you're the boss.
no problem.
do regular fees apply?
come on. -What'd I say?
you see him?
it's a bunch of puppies.
but he also wants to please you.
teach him to work, to work well, and in the end that is all he will want.
Michaels, what are you doing? -Nothing, sir.
is Agent 44 your pet?
no, sir. -He's not.
he's an FBl agent. -Yes, sir.
you wouldn't tickle an agent's belly. -No, sir.
you don't see me tickling Agent Cassavettes' underbelly, do you?
no, you do not!
get this through your head! This is not a drill!
these dogs will save your life. Agent 11 saved mine several times.
so don't tickle my animals.
all canine agents wear an invisible fence collar...
...which gives a shock designed to get his attention.
since we work exclusively with hand signals...
...sometimes it is necessary to prompt the dog to look back.
this causes serious discomfort.
for the dog's safety...
...the collar has a voltage regulator to prevent power surges.
never introduce a metal object or you'll light your animal up.
a demonstration of the collar by the most decorated canine in FBl history.
that's him! -You sure?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, a little older maybe, but that's him.
attack!
come to Papa. Now!
you said, " Now. " -I meant " now" now, not now!
word on the street is Sonny Talia put the hit out on Agent 11.
not that we' re surprised.
if Talia can infiltrate our training facility, Agent 11 isn't safe here.
I've decided to call Witness Protection in on this.
agent Murdoch, Agent Sharp.
this is a highly unusual-- -Agent Sharp, Agent 11.
this is a highly unusual request.
but the agency is very concerned.
to be able to do something like this, Talia must have a man on the inside.
until we learn who that is, we will be relocating Agent 11...
...to a protected environment.
okay, so where will we be going? -Not "we."
agent 11 is going alone.
so you're taking him away from me? -Let it go. It's for his own good.
but we're a team. Agent 11 is my most important tool.
what would I be without him? Nothing at all!
you can't take him away from me! That's like taking away my gun!
that'll be fine.
Hey, little buddy.
little hair of the dog that bit you.
I feel better.
Where's your school? -I don't have school. It's summer.
guess I'll take you to my work.
Yay! I get to deliver the mail!
great.
at least tell me where he's going.
there's no harm in that, I guess.
he's going to an FBl sled dog training facility in Alaska.
watch yourself up there.
okay, boy?
come on, get in.
I'll take those.
don't worry, Murdoch, okay? He'll be fine.
Yeah, he better be.
message from Sonny:
play dead.
the dog is in the third van.
remember, you're not supposed to be in the truck.
it's against regulations.
so just stay low and make yourself useful.
divide those stacks of letters into odd and even numbers.
okay. -Thanks, pal.
pull alongside.
I'll whack the driver, then the dog.
gotcha. Whoa!
when it's safe.
ease up alongside.
get the dog! Get the dog!
drive the car!
Hey, buddy, I'll be right back.
don't go anywhere.
whoa.
Hi.
how you doing back there?
Gordon, is this your dog?
no, that's your dog.
mine?
Yeah, I gave him to you, remember?
cool. What's his name?
spot. The dog's name's Spot.
spot?
yo, Cleavis! What's up, brother!
Oh, man!
James!
James!
James, come here.
you okay? Any broken bones?
l'm fine. -Good!
whose dog is that? -That's my dog.
your dog?
don't lie to me! -l'm not.
it's my dog, Spot. You gave him to me.
whoa, whoa, whoa!
I did not give you a dog.
what?
Hey, Stephanie.
I've been leaving you messages all night.
I know. Is James okay?
Yeah, the kid's fine. Everything's cool.
I can't believe this. I shouldn't have left him. I have to get back.
so you'll be here in two hours?
no, l'm not.
there's been some freak blizzard.
the flights are canceled...
... roads are closed, even cell phones don't work.
people are going insane.
everyone, back off!
I don't think you can handle this.
I' m coming. Somehow, l'm coming.
what do you mean I can't handle something like this?
Oh, you think I'm irresponsible.
well, for your information, I'm a very responsible guy.
I'm going to call Beverly and see if she can take James.
well, go ahead and do that. That's probably a good idea.
but if you need me, I'm here.
can I talk to James, please?
Yeah, sure. Hold on.
listen...
...don't tell her about this. It's guy stuff.
don't mention the accident...
...and don't say anything about the D-O-G.
Hi, Mom. Gordon got me a dog.
I know, I saw him before I left.
his name is Spot. Can I keep him?
Yeah, you sure can.
Wow! Thanks, Mom!
I wonder, is Agent 11 all right up there?
we've never been apart. I feel like a part of me is missing.
Cassavettes.
what do you mean, he jumped out of the van? Which van?
no problem. That wasn't our dog.
that was a decoy. Let the local dogcatcher handle it.
check on him.
murdoch, he's fine. It wasn't him.
FBl substation, Nome.
Danvers...
...this is the Tiger.
Hi, Murdoch. How you doing?
don't use my real name, man. I don't know if this line is secure.
sorry.
what's up, Tigger?
it's Tiger, and has the package arrived?
he's here, yeah.
are you sure this is an FBl dog? He doesn't look like much.
listen, 11 is the top canine agent in America...
...and probably the world. He is a killer.
okay.
Oh, that didn't impress you all? Okay.
Yeah! Look at that!
what?
see? You're in trouble now. There comes my boy right there.
my boy's always got my back.
hold on right there. Hold on!
Benny, what's going down? -Just on my 15-minute break.
but I don't back down. -They calling you out?
you got my back? -Let's get disgruntled.
okay. I'll give you that.
I give you that. What else you got?
little something I call "The George Jefferson."
Yeah, that's it!
call Weezie! -Weezie!
put the mail in the box!
make him phone home! -Phone home.
make him phone home! -Phone home!
there you go! Break it down!
Oh, grab them! Get dizzy on them!
don't get dizzy, make them dizzy! -Air Gordon, baby!
you know what? This is how I shut the club down.
Yeah, you want some of this?
you see the expression on that dog's face?
it wasn't a scowl. It was more like a smirk.
it was like he was smirking at us.
Yeah, well, I can't even believe that I'm doing this.
what?
give me the good news. -Oh, hey, Sonny.
listen, that skirt from the Witness Protection Program...
...she gave us some bad information.
so we kind of...
...followed the wrong dog.
but don't worry, because we got it all figured out.
we know where her mistake was. We'll have the dog by the morning.
I know you all my life.
we grew up on the same block.
your mother changed my diapers.
your sister's married to my goombah...
...and I'll personally shove you headfirst into an incinerator...
...and burn you to a crisp...
...if you screw this up!
this is good. You ought to have some of this with the tomato.
Oh, boy. If this ever gets out...
Hey, you didn't say nothing to nobody, did you?
No!
well, I told Paulie.
you told Paulie?
he's a gossip.
I had to. I was supposed to do that thing in Atlanta.
he promised he'll keep his mouth shut. -Yeah, right.
let's go to the dog pound.
big mouth!
nobody will know nothing.
Charlie the Clip from Jersey.
Gino-- -Shut up!
Vinny Bash from Brooklyn. Eddie Sharp.
Oh, Joey BB Eyes!
I'm not leaving him here.
you don't want a dog. Trust me.
I want Spot.
this dog isn't Spot, it
this dog doesn't even have one spot on him.
doesn't matter. It's just a name.
come on. You don't want a dog.
dogs stink!
you gotta feed and walk and clean them.
they poop everywhere. Even in your bed.
James, I'm a mailman. Mailmen hate dogs.
I won't have a dog in my house. I' m sorry.
it'll never happen.
what will happen to him?
what's he doing? -I don't know.
the dog's weird.
know what, dog? you're giving me the creeps.
what's wrong with him?
I got it!
we'll play catch, okay?
okay, catch the ball.
let's try that again.
watch the ball.
are you serious?
what's wrong with you? Why don't you play?
no play.
no.
do you hear me, Agent 11? No.
bad agent. We don't do that. No.
Hello!
is anybody home?
okay, look...
... I' m gonna do what you're supposed to do.
check it out. I'll take your collar...
...and l'm gonna be a dog.
as a matter of fact, l'm gonna be you.
a big, stupid dog.
look.
I can sit.
I can lay down.
well, I can't scratch my head, but Benny probably could.
I can lick my...
... paw.
watch me, I can chase my tail.
I' m chasing my tail.
he's so weird.
Oh, God.
I don't know what to tell you, James.
you're not trying hard enough.
are you kidding?
I mean, come on...
...the dog doesn't want to play.
dog's broken.
you didn't try hard enough.
I' m about to throw up!
I didn't try hard enough.
it's not my fault this dog is broke!
maybe when your mom gets back...
...she can get you a dog that actually works!
why don't you watch TV or something?
I keep it on cartoons. Don't try to get smart.
now quietly entertain yourself.
Yeah, this'll do.
look, Brain! I made a round bird.
gotta get this stupid dog collar off my neck!
birdy, birdy, birdy! Narf!
No!
James, put that down!
James, put that down.
say we'll keep Spot.
we can't. He's not
okay, okay! You can keep the dog.
here we go! You ready?
go get it, girl!
hey there.
that's him.
wrong dog.
do you mind?
I gotta take these two creatures to the park...
...and I don't need you giving me attitude.
don't you all look adorable?
look, you got a kid, you got the dog, you got you.
Norman Rockwell, man. Let me get a picture.
say "Tupac"!
you see that, dog? He said, "Tupac.
I feel like such a proud mama right now.
look...
... my family.
all right, you want to come to the park?
park? For what, man?
to watch you watch the dog? The dog don't move!
he ain't moved since I walked in! Look at him!
I think he broke. -Yeah.
get Spot's ball, we'll get the Frisbee. Meet in the hall.
go get it, Spot!
go get it.
maybe the Frisbee will work.
come on, go get the Frisbee.
what's wrong with you?
you see anything?
just keep your eyes peeled.
where does a mutt go?
take it easy.
he has a bladder condition. He can't control himself.
I got your bladder condition over here.
take it easy. Come on.
get your mutt out of here! Take a hike!
jeez, it stinks, Gino.
you think it'll stain?
spot!
Hey, help!
he stole her purse!
help!
there he is.
spot! -James, come here!
spot, come back!
sorry, man. That dog is totally psycho.
Where's that crazy dog?
there he is.
spot, no!
bad dog! What are you doing?
I' m sorry. He's not really my dog. I didn't know he was a thief!
what?
what's that?
listen, I said l'm sorry.
Oh, I get it. How much you want? Twenty bucks?
twenty-five bucks.
come on, that purse ain't worth more than that.
I said l'm sorry.
Hey, back off. What's the matter, lady?
Gordon, it's me again.
I can't believe it. This is terrible.
I made it out of the snow but all the roads are blocked.
the stupid bus is stuck. I don't know how I'll get back.
you really don't know how much I appreciate this.
you're a good man, Gordon.
Hey, Gordon?
you know what? I really hate asking this...
... but the thing is, James has this little trouble sleeping
I gotta go.
what's wrong?
I can't take it anymore!
I can't sleep! I can't eat! I'm an emotional wreck!
it's all right.
you're here now.
... I don't know how to tell you this.
are you wearing 11's dog tag? -He's feeling what l'm feeling.
I talked to Danvers.
he's only had one cup of kibbles today.
the dog? You came here to talk about the dog?
of course! He's my partner! I miss him!
we've never been apart this long.
he's always been a good eater, just like me, even when he was a puppy.
Murdoch...
...this is not healthy.
I want you to fly up there...
...check on him, and get this out of your system.
Really?
there you go. You do the crime, you do the time.
I told you he wouldn't like that.
of course he likes that.
that's what that sound means.
Yeah, right.
come on, it's bedtime.
just holler if you need anything.
good night, Spot.
are you kidding?
stupid dog!
what's the racket about?
okay, I get it.
jeez.
Oh, I'm glad you can sleep.
wait, my keys.
let's go, stupid.
come on, go already.
what now?
that's nasty. I' m not picking that up.
what's the big idea?
all right, I'm sorry I tied you to the furnace.
let me in.
all right-- Hey, where you going?
come back here!
Hey, where are you going? You stupid dog.
James!
Oh, God. Nasty.
God!
shut up down there!
I'm covered in caca!
God.
Oh, God.
James?
spot. Oh, God, l'm gonna kill you.
Oh, God!
come on.
got some l. D?
I. D?
I don't think so.
don't get wise, buddy.
listen, I live right here. The dog locked me out.
you been drinking?
no, I have not been drinking!
I'm taking care of the neighbor's kid...
...then this dog came!
came from where?
hell.
this is Satan's dog. I' m telling you! He gets mad at the drop of a hat!
he got pissed off and locked me out of my own house! He's crazy!
put your hands on your head! Put your hands on your head!
okay, let's just try to relax here.
he locked me out of my house.
Satan's dog locked you out?
Yeah.
you think I'd do this to myself?
Oh, boy. -Whoa, whoa.
come with us. We'll get someone who can help you.
not in my car. He reeks.
Oh, thank God! James! See, that's the kid!
and that's the dog!
son, do you know him?
that's Gordon. He lives here.
next time you step outside, sir, I suggest you take your keys.
Thanks, I'll remember that.
let me in the house!
this is crazy, Gino. Sonny will nail our heads together.
I say we get our passports, start to learn Spanish.
Arliss...
...you gotta focus.
all we gotta do is get in the dog's head.
so every place a dog has gotta go...
...we hang the posters.
sooner or later he's gotta show.
and when he does...
... bada-bing.
that's smart.
what are you doing?
you're doing it all wrong. Come on, check it out.
you gotta put a bunch of junk on it. Let me give you some style.
here you go.
Yeah, that's it. Yeah, get crazy.
girls love that.
that's the look.
Yeah.
see? That's got attitude.
Gordon, what was your daddy like?
my daddy?
well, I'm just like you. I don't have a daddy.
what about your mommy?
well, I didn't have a mommy either. -You didn't have a mommy?
Hey, man, it's cool.
I mean, look at Spot.
spot doesn't have a mommy or daddy.
he's a stray, but he's happy.
I mean, he's a little screwed up, but he's happy.
I' m sorry you didn't have a mommy, Gordon.
I didn't need a mommy.
if I did have one, she'd probably comb my hair like this.
make me look foolish.
mush! Come on!
Tigger, you made it.
it's Tiger, you moron!
you seem awfully happy to be here.
this is not a smile.
my face is frozen like this!
now, how's Agent 11?
that's not Agent 11!
well, that's the dog they sent us.
Cassavettes. -The dog that jumped out was Agent 11.
the tags were switched!
are you sure? -I'm positive.
it had to be Sharp.
forget it.
she's long gone.
okay, Spot, let's try it again.
listen up, Spot. I got no time for you.
and I know you don't like me either.
you're your own dog. You like to hang back.
I'm down with that.
but I'm here to talk about the kid.
see, his mom keeps him on a short leash.
you hear what I'm saying?
I'd like to see the kid have some fun.
let's go, Spot. Let's hook the kid up with some fun.
let's go! Let's go have some fun!
come on, let's go have some fun!
I' m sorry, James.
let's just go.
you should be ashamed of yourself. Come on.
what's he doing?
I don't know. Why don't you try throwing it?
how about that?
good boy, good boy.
here, come on, Spot.
come on, jump up.
come on, Spot. Good boy.
did you see how high he jumped? -Yeah, like five feet.
our boy can play!
he isn't retarded. -No, he's a smart dog.
Thanks, Spot. I owe you one.
what do you say we get him a bone or a snack or whatever dogs eat?
Hey! -Oh!
Oh! -Get out of here!
you believe these kids? -No respect.
Gino. Gino.
that's our mutt!
that's our mutt! -Let's go.
all right, you go get the dog...
...one of those-- Whatever he wants. I' m gonna ask this lady a question.
Hey, how's it going?
Starchild?
"Starchild ," are you serious?
you can have anything you want, Spot.
what about this one?
no.
hello.
cat got your tongue?
now, where did this mutt go?
Hey, kid! Where's that dog?
be careful. There's piranha in there.
you get the guns.
let's get that mutt.
No! I'm not paying for this!
spot?
spot, are you okay?
"can cause paralysis"?
I'll go the other way.
they got me.
help. Help!
Hey, kid.
how you doing?
want to help your Uncle Gino find the doggy?
Hey!
whoa. Help!
help!
you go that way.
that's it. It's over.
my legs!
Gordon? It's me again.
I'm just calling to check in.
are you there? I' m sure everything's fine.
if you want to, call me on my cell phone.
okay, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.
stop!
so Seattle, huh? -Yeah.
don't worry. We have lots of room.
we'll get you there. -We'll go straight there?
we' re not stopping for nothing.
well, there you are.
Oh, you're gonna be really comfy in there.
Oh, just don't make any fast movements.
what's that smell?
Hello?
Hi, Mr. Zebra.
I gotta report an attempted murder. -Yo, Granger!
you're catching!
this is just perfect.
so where did this happen?
at the pet store. There were two of them.
one was a real big guy, looking like Pavarotti.
I'm telling you, it was a hit.
a hit? And you were the target?
dude, not me, the dog.
the dog? -Spot was incredible.
he got the bad guys.
it was amazing. He just took those two guys out.
it's weird, I always thought he was retarded.
you know what? If you're asking me...
...you're the one who is retarded.
dude, he's not retarded. You are.
yeah? Well...
know what l'm thinking? -What?
when Stephanie returns, I'll tell her...
... not to leave James with a nut who gets her kid a dog while she's away.
actually, that's not his dog at all.
that's "Satan's dog.
let's leave. We don't need these idiots.
Oh, man.
come on, Spot.
looks like Agent Sharp skipped the country.
she did not.
we got ahold of all her credit card records.
she bought a one-way ticket to Belize.
she never made the airport.
and let me tell you something, if you don't get that dog...
...you're gonna make the airport. But as part of a runway!
Oh, we' re dead. We are so dead.
you know, I never saw Godfather III.
I heard it wasn't as good as the first two.
I thought we had more time, Gino.
Arliss, Arliss, listen to me.
take a rest. We're gonna find the dog.
Hey, Gino, I didn't think they let you out of Jersey.
what are you doing here? -What do you say, T ommy?
I just got a little business to finish up.
Oh, that's good. That's good. Great.
I can't stand that clown. He's got no respect.
hello. -Yeah, I know who's got your dog.
my neighbor. The guy's a freak.
they got the dog. We got the dog.
the bureau appreciates your help.
a canine agent disappeared in this area a few days ago.
we are intent on finding that dog.
what is it with the dogs all of a sudden?
I had this idiot in who said the Mafia put a contract out on his dog.
that's Agent 11.
Yeah, and...?
he's my partner, you greasy-haired reptile. Tell me everything.
I can't sleep.
why not, buddy? -I had a bad dream.
about what?
Charizard was trying to burn me, and I had to run away.
who's Charizard? -A Pokemon.
I thought Pikachu was the Pokemon.
there's all different Pokemon.
and they all have different powers? -You catch on fast.
and are they named after what they sort of do?
kind of.
okay, so if you were a Pokemon, you'd be Snotty-nose-achu.
you would be Stinky-feet-achu.
and you'd be Fart-in-bed-achu.
it wasn't me.
it wasn't me, either.
wait, if it wasn't me, and it wasn't you...
do you like my mom?
Yeah, yeah. I really do.
why don't you marry her?
well, because, you know, marriage is a big step.
you really gotta know someone before you do something like that.
you'd be fun for a dad.
you think so?
Thanks.
hold it. Hold it.
I think this is the block.
Yeah, let's go.
and they lived happily ever after......because they won the lottery and moved to Hawaii.
there you go.
don't hog all the blankets.
I am so glad this is off our plate.
Yeah, you look like you could use something off your plate.
have you seen any of these men?
Yeah. These two. They destroyed the pet store.
if there's any cost for the damages, they should be held responsible.
you're very lucky, Mr. Smith. These men are extremely dangerous.
you should be all right now that Agent 11 is with us. 11, let's go!
what?
no. -Spot's leaving?
I promised the dog to the kid. You can't take the dog.
don't take the dog. Look at the kid.
you can't take him. -Agent 11 is U. S. Government property.
but you can't take him.
come on, James.
spot doesn't belong to us.
I think he has to go back with these guys.
here we go, boy.
he doesn't like that.
come on.
don't go, Spot.
No!
you're gonna have to eat something. -l'm not eating till Spot comes back.
well, Spot's not coming back.
that's life. Get used to it.
James...
let's see.
you lost the dog.
the boy wants you dead.
no way you're getting jiggy with his mama.
that makes you a single man again, brother. Give it to me up top.
okay, leave me hanging. Okay, cool.
I'll remember that.
I need you to eat.
11, eat.
you're gonna be stupid and not do anything?
I am doing something. I'm moving on.
you should too. Listen, James, don't get attached to things.
lt only ends up messing with you. -But he's our dog.
no, he's a government official, much like myself.
no, he's our dog and he loves us.
know what? You're just a kid.
you know nothing. You're irrational!
no, you're stupid!
Ow! Jeez!
Hello! -Gordon, hi.
Oh, it's you.
you won't believe what I've been through, but l'm really close now.
every time you call, you got some lame excuse.
what's it this time? Dog ate your homework?
are you okay? Is everything all right?
and always with the questions.
all I want to know is, when are you gonna be here?!
Gordon, what happened?
I will not be treated like an irresponsible idiot.
you're the irresponsible one.
it's your fault!
I shouldn't be watching a dog...
...and I sure don't need some kid in my life.
stop!
you're taking me to my kid, now!
agent 11! He's escaped.
agent 11!
James.
all right, truce. Come out here.
come on, this isn't funny.
my kid. I lost my kid.
keep your mouth shut.
this is suicide.
how in the hell could you guys let Agent 11 escape?
you'll all be reprimanded. -Murdoch!
where you going?
to find my dog, and I know exactly where he went.
back to those two.
James, I thought you were dead. Get in the truck.
come on, buddy, get in the truck. -l'm gonna find Spot.
how you gonna find him? Think you're a detective?
why did you run away, James?
what do you care? You don't want me.
what?
no, I didn't mean it like that.
why did you say that to my mom?
you know, I was just scared.
and sometimes, when people get upset...
...it comes out all messed up.
do you miss Spot?
Yeah, I guess I do.
I' m really glad you ended up staying with me.
glad we became pals.
I didn't mean what I said to your ma. Not even a little bit.
think you could forgive me?
it's okay, Gordon. I'm glad we're friends.
me too.
there they are. Back it up.
Oh, no. It's those guys. Come on!
get back there! Hold on!
James, you okay? -Yeah.
throw those boxes at them. -All right!
dive bomb! Depth charge!
watch it! -I got it. I got it.
this mailman's gonna lose his job.
Where'd they go?
James, are you okay?
look what I found.
good idea. Come on.
police!
police!
help! 911!
help! Help!
James!
Oh, that's gotta hurt.
hurry, James!
Hey, get over here! Give me the dog!
Where's the dog? Get over here.
Gino, help me! Come on! Come on, Gino!
James, James. -Okay.
come on, get off.
help.
run!
I'll save you from calling the cops. We got one here.
sit down over there.
and you, shut up.
where is that mutt?
I thought he was with the FBl.
he escaped to be with you.
how touching. I'm all choked up.
could you loan me a handkerchief while we wait for the mutt?
Gino!
somebody help me here.
get off of me!
come here, you.
that's it.
Mr. Talia, what are you doing here?
I took a wild guess and figured you two baboons would screw it up.
sit down, the both of youse. -Sonny, the dog
lt wasn't our fault. -No?
I don't know if it's worth the bullets for the two of youse.
I gotta ask my accountant. Afterwards.
excuse me, Mr. Mob Boss Guy, I wouldn't make any sudden moves if I were you.
you wouldn't, you punk? Why not?
I don't think Spot would like that. -And who is Spot?
spot!
come on.
come on.
11, the gun!
you take it, Gino. -Whoa!
spot! -11!
I kick him, James!
run, James! Run!
no, not again! Come on!
Oh, no, not again.
Hey, Spot. -you're the greatest, Spot.
Hey, what do you got there, boy?
all right, get up!
scratchy, scratchy, good dog!
good boy. I love you.
agent 11...
...come on.
his name's Spot. He's staying with us.
open up your eyes, man. This dog's got a lot going on inside.
he just wants to be a dog, with a family.
he's never had a family before, and it's been really rough.
the FBl is his family.
the FBl is not a family. It's a job.
come on. He's got a chance to be happy now...
...with people that care about him.
I want to give him a home. I won't let you mess that up.
I think it's time that Spot decides what he wants.
I can't ask him. He's a dog.
let's just see. Let's see what he wants.
Oh, bud.
good boy, Spot.
what is it?
what do you want, boy?
what is it, boy?
I'll miss you too.
thanks for the ride.
Benny! Benny, what happened?
I don't believe anybody's dead.
gordon and James took down a mob boss and his henchmen.
gordon gonna need some help.
we need a SWAT team, man.
then you hit the guy in the head with the meatballs?
that was funny.
mom!
what's going on?!
Oh, my God!
Stephanie. You look great. -We had the greatest time!
gordon had me under his arm and then two bad guys with guns chased us.
there were dogs everywhere and this is Spot, the dog Gordon gave me.
you look like you had a hard trip. Maybe we should talk about this later.
if you ever come within 50 feet of my son, I'll call the police.
well, Stephanie, I live 25 feet away.
those came in very handy.
I can explain.
come on.
hey there, music man.
I' m gonna catch you in the yard. We're gonna settle this, man to man.
what's up, G? -Yo, what's up?
I' m all right. You know what, man?
he's not such a bad dog after all. -No, he's a good dog.
you really dug Stephanie, didn't you?
now she just sees you as unreliable, immature...
...irresponsible, fly-by-night, bad kid-watching dude.
you want a hug, man?
no, I'd rather not. I'll just take the dog to the park or something.
but thanks, man. -Go on and walk your dog.
all right. See you later.
do you like it? There you go. Thanks.
Hey!
spot!
I'm sorry.
what? What's this?
whoa, hey!
what's up, buddy? Trying to jump me?
Hey.
Hey, Spot. Hey, Spot...
you two turning to a life of crime now?
here. -Thanks.
so, you're a hero now.
James tells me you and Spot saved him from the bad guys.
I actually thought he was exaggerating because he likes you so much.
it's really true. He's an FBl agent. -I actually checked it out.
it sounds like you saved James' life too. Thank you.
listen, l...
...I think maybe I might have jumped to conclusions about you...
...and I wonder if you'd like to give it another shot.
lt? You mean us?
the two of us.
if you make it the three of us, l'm in.
okay! The four of us. Sorry.
come on.
all right, let's do this thing.
transfers confirmed.
move in. -That's very good.
this is the FBI.
the building is surrounded. You 're all under arrest.
I repeat, you 're all under arrest.
put your hands up.
this is the FBI!
Sonny Talia, you're under arrest.
Oh, yeah? For what? Import/export?
calm down, buddy. Here's my bill of lading.
coffee, paint, computer chips and lawn chairs.
there's nothing in here but lawn chairs.
Hey, sweetheart, you're a beautiful girl.
if you get tired of the FBl...
...you can come and work for me in one of my dance joints.
bring in Agent 11!
agent 11...
...search!
what's this?
go, go, go! Move!
get away from me! Get away from me!
agent 11!
Bleeker Street. Dog Town.
no, you don't. No, you don't.
come on, Spike. Can't we do this nice, just once?
all right. You asked for it.
what do we got here? Go get the chicken.
go get the chicken.
psych, Spike!
come on, Boodles.
we gotta stop meeting like this. I'm telling you.
it costs me 20 bucks a week in meatballs.
let's do it again. Go get the meatball!
where are you? Where is that stinking dog?
well, well, well.
what's up, Tyson? You on lock-down?
want to get the mail? Want to get the mailman? Come on, try!
too fast!
who am l? MC Hammer! You know why? Because you can't touch this.
not today, Tyson!
here you are, baby. Signed, sealed, delivered.
thank you, Benny. I'll see you tomorrow?
Oh, yeah. And remember, if there's anything I can do for you...
...all you have to do is raise that flag...
...and I'll come through for you, baby. Rain, sleet or snow.
this postman always delivers.
damn.
Oh, hey, Gordon. What's up, man? you're looking smooth, brother.
Tyson again?
Yeah, but l'm cool.
that dog's on an all-white-meat diet. He never did that to no brother.
that's not funny. -Yes, it is.
why don't you request a different route if he's giving you a hard time?
there's not a dog on this planet that can scare me.
okay, brother.
that's funny. That's hysterical.
come on, baby. They're just jokes.
don't get postal on me.
postal? I' m not postal.
don't even play with me like that. You know all white people are crazy.
I'll check you back at the crib.
Hey, G. You can keep that dog, dog.
get it, dog?
here's some good news, Mr. Talia.
the metal ball bearing we inserted to replace your missing appendage...
...should help you maintain a natural appearance.
luckily we were able to save the other one...
...or else we'd have to put in two, and when you walk...
it's just a little urological humor.
Sonny, let it go, please! Listen, Sonny, it's okay.
the prosecution has absolutely nothing on you.
you're a businessman with a valid bill of lading for importation.
they can't prove prior knowledge or possession.
they got no case!
I'm not worried about that right now.
what I'm worried about is this Agent 11 dog. It's always this dog.
he made me lose 22 million dollars in the last three years.
and now he made me lose, he made me...
you know, Sonny, you only need one.
then give me one of yours. -Just looking on the bright side.
you can't do anything about the dog. -Yes, I can.
man's best friend. Bad dog!
I'm sorry, buddy.
Hey, baby.
Steph, someone has mailed you a stuffed dog.
Rick, the shoot for Slick and Slimy is down the hall.
Gordon! -Hey, Steph.
this isn't a good time for me right now.
I got James a little present here.
Oh, my God, that's so sweet. All he's been talking about is dogs.
he doesn't understand you can't have one in an apartment.
honey, come here. Gordon's got something for you.
what's up, little man? Look what Uncle Gordon got you!
I'm not really your uncle, so if I kiss your mom...
...that's okay.
don't worry, James. There's no chance of that happening.
Hey, pal, what do we say?
thank you.
I like dogs. I' m gonna keep you for a long time.
yo, Steph. This guy's whack.
hello. Yeah, Daisy? Flight's at 9.
you waltz in here with that toy...
...thinking you can buy back Stephanie through her son?
you're mad you didn't think of it first.
I don't have to. I'm here because she wants a real man around the house.
are you gonna go arrest one and bring him home to her?
okay, guys.
police business. I gotta go.
I'll show you to the door.
all right, bye now. Take care. Don't get shot.
out. -What?
out. Now. Go. -Come on, Steph.
Oh, Steph. You can't fight it, baby.
I' m cool.
don't even start.
you need some handcuffs instead of them stamps. Rick got them.
look, G, l'm feeling you, man. Stephanie's a dime.
a dime? What's that mean?
a ten.
but she comes with carry-on.
the kid.
what's your point?
it's like you're dating Janet, but Janet's bringing Tito.
you don't want that!
we're just friends. I'm giving her advice on her love life.
Love-life advice? She'd be better off calling the Psychic Friends Network.
if you want to get with that mommy, you got to be a poppy.
are you ready for that? -No!
I'm cool with my current responsibilities, thank you.
like what?
remembering to floss.
feeding my fish.
and, at some point, returning The Matrix video to Blockbuster.
a kid abandoned in a mailbox should jump at the chance...
...to screw up a family of his own. -You have to bring that up?
Yeah, I have to bring that up, man! What the--?
didn't your foster parents teach you to respect other people's property?
the last time I sat on this couch, my butt was orange for a week.
take your dang couch out of here. I didn't want it in the first place.
I don't have space for it.
I'm teaching yoga in the front room.
I don't want to hear about you teaching yoga.
you don't even know one yoga move.
I can pick a five-dollar bill up with my butt.
you cannot. -Give me five dollars.
I want to see this.
you're gonna see it, baby. you're gonna see it.
watch this.
okay.
all right, l'm stuck.
you all right? -Just come push me over. Push me.
just push me. Just push me to the right.
Hey, hey, watch the couch, baby.
all right, come on, man.
Yes, l'm gonna watch football. -You know l'm ready!
Yeah, l'm gonna watch some football!
miss Maguire, I have people here. You must come down now.
miss Maguire, I have people here. You must come down now.
Hey, what are you yelling about?
you tell her to come down now, because we are leaving to the airport.
she's so slow.
where you going, man? -Nowhere, man.
Hey, man! Gordon! Yo, yo!
do you mind?
you can't take care of the hamster I gave you.
what you gonna do with a woman? -Come on, man, let me do this.
go handle your business then.
what's up, Steph?
I' m going away on business and the babysitter's late.
she said she'd be here in ten minutes, 30 minutes ago.
okay, calm down. It's okay. Super G's here.
Oh, God, I hope this is you, Daisy.
Hello? Daisy!
you'll be here in ten minutes? If you don't get here, I'll miss my plane!
I'll watch James until Daisy gets here.
I don't think that's
Daisy! Yeah, it's Gordon.
get your butt over here, girl, fast!
there you go.
this isn't a good idea. You don't know anything about children.
it's ten minutes. What's he going to do, dry out?
come on, we'll kick back, have a couple of beers, huh?
okay, one beer.
you got business to take care of. Just relax, it's gonna be fine.
I'll keep an eye on James and James'll keep an eye on me.
Daisy is on her way, so Gordon's gonna watch you for a few minutes.
are you okay with that?
let's go! -Okay, okay.
move it! Move it now!
this is important. Remind Daisy to always check the food pyramid.
this is a list of what he can watch and when, only an hour a day, no PG.
no video games, all right?
Oh, and you've got to make sure that she takes him to piano and soccer.
look, it's all in the schedule.
all the shaded green areas are all free-play time.
Daisy knows all this, right? She's been watching him for two years.
right. You're right. Okay.
mommy will be home tomorrow, and when Mommy's away who do we listen to?
Daisy. -Right. And remember, follow...
follow the rules and playtime will follow.
got it.
I love you.
Gordon, you're a lifesaver. -Yeah, all five flavors.
all people waiting for you!
don't make smoochie-smoochie. Everybody, put on seat belts!
all right, there it goes! Run, baby, run!
knock him on his ass!
my bad. Knock him to the asphalt!
knock him to the asphalt!
I hope the babysitter gets here soon so we can go to the big screen.
I know.
Hello? Daisy, yeah, it's Gordon. Where are you?
what do you mean, you can't come?
the game's on. Get your butt over here.
food poisoning?
Daisy, listen, you can have food poisoning over here...
...with James.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I don't think she's coming.
don't worry.
your mom'll be back tomorrow, and Benny will hang with us.
you're hanging yourself fine.
remember, if he gets scared, cries...
...or messes his drawers, give me a call.
Benny, he's gonna be fine.
I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to him.
James, if he goes to the bathroom longer than five minutes...
...Iight a match.
I'll be watching the big screen! you're on your own, dog!
that ain't funny. Benny!
I' m hungry.
good. Okay, food, I could do that.
come on, kid. -I can't have breakfast now.
why not? -It's dinnertime.
so?
I don't know about this.
doesn't your mommy make you clean?
occasionally, I take a flamethrower to it and start all over again.
what's that smell?
that's the smell of a man.
it's what a man's place smells like.
but listen. Come over here.
we gotta go over some rules here. Listen carefully.
this is my stuff.
look at it.
it's beautiful. It's 500 watts of Dolby digital sound.
stereo, receiver, DVD player. The tower of power!
check it out.
don't touch it.
you hear that? Can you feel it, baby?!
say, "Don't touch Gordon's stuff. " -Don't touch Gordon's stuff.
we're gonna get along just fine.
here we go.
some natural whole-bran cereal, just like the chart says...
...and some soy milk.
hold it now, hold it now.
can't forget your prunes.
all right, dig in.
your mom ever say anything about me? -I heard her with Daisy.
listening in to your mom's conversations, huh? That's good.
What'd she say? -She said that you're funny.
funny? Funny, that's good.
Yeah, we like funny.
what else? -That you're irresponsible.
irresponsible?
irresponsible, waste your time...
...and you only want one thing.
Oh, and you're some kind of hound.
she said that?
what's she got you eating here?
it's good.
how can you eat that?
"no sugar added"? And They're proud of that?
I want to tell you about this man I know. His name's Cap'n Crunch.
he's got some friends too.
count Chocula and Toucan Sam.
Froot Loops.
I' m not allowed.
wait, wait. You see, the warden's away.
just us guys here. We hunt, we gather, we eat what we want.
what if my mom finds out?
I won't tell if you don't.
I see it says I shouldn't have given you sugar.
those are live animals!
catch me!
I want this Agent 11 taken out.
I don't know. An FBl agent could be a little tricky.
this guy is huge!
not him, you moron. The dog. Agent 11 is a dog.
that's funny. That's a good one, Sonny. That's a good one.
you want we should whack a dog?
you two tubs of blubber think that's funny?
there's no reason to get personal. -This is personal!
it don't get no more personal! I want the dog dead!
all right, all right, Sonny.
but, you know, we're pros.
how we gonna hold our heads up in the community...
...with people knowing we' re going around to put the whack on a pooch?
I mean, we got an image.
if the two of youse don't whack this pooch...
...then you will get whacked.
okay. you're the boss.
no problem.
do regular fees apply?
come on. -What'd I say?
you see him?
it's a bunch of puppies.
but he also wants to please you.
teach him to work, to work well, and in the end that is all he will want.
Michaels, what are you doing? -Nothing, sir.
is Agent 44 your pet?
no, sir. -He's not.
he's an FBl agent. -Yes, sir.
you wouldn't tickle an agent's belly. -No, sir.
you don't see me tickling Agent Cassavettes' underbelly, do you?
no, you do not!
get this through your head! This is not a drill!
these dogs will save your life. Agent 11 saved mine several times.
so don't tickle my animals.
all canine agents wear an invisible fence collar...
...which gives a shock designed to get his attention.
since we work exclusively with hand signals...
...sometimes it is necessary to prompt the dog to look back.
this causes serious discomfort.
for the dog's safety...
...the collar has a voltage regulator to prevent power surges.
never introduce a metal object or you'll light your animal up.
a demonstration of the collar by the most decorated canine in FBl history.
that's him! -You sure?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, a little older maybe, but that's him.
attack!
come to Papa. Now!
you said, " Now. " -I meant " now" now, not now!
word on the street is Sonny Talia put the hit out on Agent 11.
not that we' re surprised.
if Talia can infiltrate our training facility, Agent 11 isn't safe here.
I've decided to call Witness Protection in on this.
agent Murdoch, Agent Sharp.
this is a highly unusual-- -Agent Sharp, Agent 11.
this is a highly unusual request.
but the agency is very concerned.
to be able to do something like this, Talia must have a man on the inside.
until we learn who that is, we will be relocating Agent 11...
...to a protected environment.
okay, so where will we be going? -Not "we."
agent 11 is going alone.
so you're taking him away from me? -Let it go. It's for his own good.
but we're a team. Agent 11 is my most important tool.
what would I be without him? Nothing at all!
you can't take him away from me! That's like taking away my gun!
that'll be fine.
Hey, little buddy.
little hair of the dog that bit you.
I feel better.
Where's your school? -I don't have school. It's summer.
guess I'll take you to my work.
Yay! I get to deliver the mail!
great.
at least tell me where he's going.
there's no harm in that, I guess.
he's going to an FBl sled dog training facility in Alaska.
watch yourself up there.
okay, boy?
come on, get in.
I'll take those.
don't worry, Murdoch, okay? He'll be fine.
Yeah, he better be.
message from Sonny:
play dead.
the dog is in the third van.
remember, you're not supposed to be in the truck.
it's against regulations.
so just stay low and make yourself useful.
divide those stacks of letters into odd and even numbers.
okay. -Thanks, pal.
pull alongside.
I'll whack the driver, then the dog.
gotcha. Whoa!
when it's safe.
ease up alongside.
get the dog! Get the dog!
drive the car!
Hey, buddy, I'll be right back.
don't go anywhere.
whoa.
Hi.
how you doing back there?
Gordon, is this your dog?
no, that's your dog.
mine?
Yeah, I gave him to you, remember?
cool. What's his name?
spot. The dog's name's Spot.
spot?
yo, Cleavis! What's up, brother!
Oh, man!
James!
James!
James, come here.
you okay? Any broken bones?
l'm fine. -Good!
whose dog is that? -That's my dog.
your dog?
don't lie to me! -l'm not.
it's my dog, Spot. You gave him to me.
whoa, whoa, whoa!
I did not give you a dog.
what?
Hey, Stephanie.
I've been leaving you messages all night.
I know. Is James okay?
Yeah, the kid's fine. Everything's cool.
I can't believe this. I shouldn't have left him. I have to get back.
so you'll be here in two hours?
no, l'm not.
there's been some freak blizzard.
the flights are canceled...
... roads are closed, even cell phones don't work.
people are going insane.
everyone, back off!
I don't think you can handle this.
I' m coming. Somehow, l'm coming.
what do you mean I can't handle something like this?
Oh, you think I'm irresponsible.
well, for your information, I'm a very responsible guy.
I'm going to call Beverly and see if she can take James.
well, go ahead and do that. That's probably a good idea.
but if you need me, I'm here.
can I talk to James, please?
Yeah, sure. Hold on.
listen...
...don't tell her about this. It's guy stuff.
don't mention the accident...
...and don't say anything about the D-O-G.
Hi, Mom. Gordon got me a dog.
I know, I saw him before I left.
his name is Spot. Can I keep him?
Yeah, you sure can.
Wow! Thanks, Mom!
I wonder, is Agent 11 all right up there?
we've never been apart. I feel like a part of me is missing.
Cassavettes.
what do you mean, he jumped out of the van? Which van?
no problem. That wasn't our dog.
that was a decoy. Let the local dogcatcher handle it.
check on him.
murdoch, he's fine. It wasn't him.
FBl substation, Nome.
Danvers...
...this is the Tiger.
Hi, Murdoch. How you doing?
don't use my real name, man. I don't know if this line is secure.
sorry.
what's up, Tigger?
it's Tiger, and has the package arrived?
he's here, yeah.
are you sure this is an FBl dog? He doesn't look like much.
listen, 11 is the top canine agent in America...
...and probably the world. He is a killer.
okay.
Oh, that didn't impress you all? Okay.
Yeah! Look at that!
what?
see? You're in trouble now. There comes my boy right there.
my boy's always got my back.
hold on right there. Hold on!
Benny, what's going down? -Just on my 15-minute break.
but I don't back down. -They calling you out?
you got my back? -Let's get disgruntled.
okay. I'll give you that.
I give you that. What else you got?
little something I call "The George Jefferson."
Yeah, that's it!
call Weezie! -Weezie!
put the mail in the box!
make him phone home! -Phone home.
make him phone home! -Phone home!
there you go! Break it down!
Oh, grab them! Get dizzy on them!
don't get dizzy, make them dizzy! -Air Gordon, baby!
you know what? This is how I shut the club down.
Yeah, you want some of this?
you see the expression on that dog's face?
it wasn't a scowl. It was more like a smirk.
it was like he was smirking at us.
Yeah, well, I can't even believe that I'm doing this.
what?
give me the good news. -Oh, hey, Sonny.
listen, that skirt from the Witness Protection Program...
...she gave us some bad information.
so we kind of...
...followed the wrong dog.
but don't worry, because we got it all figured out.
we know where her mistake was. We'll have the dog by the morning.
I know you all my life.
we grew up on the same block.
your mother changed my diapers.
your sister's married to my goombah...
...and I'll personally shove you headfirst into an incinerator...
...and burn you to a crisp...
...if you screw this up!
this is good. You ought to have some of this with the tomato.
Oh, boy. If this ever gets out...
Hey, you didn't say nothing to nobody, did you?
No!
well, I told Paulie.
you told Paulie?
he's a gossip.
I had to. I was supposed to do that thing in Atlanta.
he promised he'll keep his mouth shut. -Yeah, right.
let's go to the dog pound.
big mouth!
nobody will know nothing.
Charlie the Clip from Jersey.
Gino-- -Shut up!
Vinny Bash from Brooklyn. Eddie Sharp.
Oh, Joey BB Eyes!
I'm not leaving him here.
you don't want a dog. Trust me.
I want Spot.
this dog isn't Spot, it
this dog doesn't even have one spot on him.
doesn't matter. It's just a name.
come on. You don't want a dog.
dogs stink!
you gotta feed and walk and clean them.
they poop everywhere. Even in your bed.
James, I'm a mailman. Mailmen hate dogs.
I won't have a dog in my house. I' m sorry.
it'll never happen.
what will happen to him?
what's he doing? -I don't know.
the dog's weird.
know what, dog? you're giving me the creeps.
what's wrong with him?
I got it!
we'll play catch, okay?
okay, catch the ball.
let's try that again.
watch the ball.
are you serious?
what's wrong with you? Why don't you play?
no play.
no.
do you hear me, Agent 11? No.
bad agent. We don't do that. No.
Hello!
is anybody home?
okay, look...
... I' m gonna do what you're supposed to do.
check it out. I'll take your collar...
...and l'm gonna be a dog.
as a matter of fact, l'm gonna be you.
a big, stupid dog.
look.
I can sit.
I can lay down.
well, I can't scratch my head, but Benny probably could.
I can lick my...
... paw.
watch me, I can chase my tail.
I' m chasing my tail.
he's so weird.
Oh, God.
I don't know what to tell you, James.
you're not trying hard enough.
are you kidding?
I mean, come on...
...the dog doesn't want to play.
dog's broken.
you didn't try hard enough.
I' m about to throw up!
I didn't try hard enough.
it's not my fault this dog is broke!
maybe when your mom gets back...
...she can get you a dog that actually works!
why don't you watch TV or something?
I keep it on cartoons. Don't try to get smart.
now quietly entertain yourself.
Yeah, this'll do.
look, Brain! I made a round bird.
gotta get this stupid dog collar off my neck!
birdy, birdy, birdy! Narf!
No!
James, put that down!
James, put that down.
say we'll keep Spot.
we can't. He's not
okay, okay! You can keep the dog.
here we go! You ready?
go get it, girl!
hey there.
that's him.
wrong dog.
do you mind?
I gotta take these two creatures to the park...
...and I don't need you giving me attitude.
don't you all look adorable?
look, you got a kid, you got the dog, you got you.
Norman Rockwell, man. Let me get a picture.
say "Tupac"!
you see that, dog? He said, "Tupac.
I feel like such a proud mama right now.
look...
... my family.
all right, you want to come to the park?
park? For what, man?
to watch you watch the dog? The dog don't move!
he ain't moved since I walked in! Look at him!
I think he broke. -Yeah.
get Spot's ball, we'll get the Frisbee. Meet in the hall.
go get it, Spot!
go get it.
maybe the Frisbee will work.
come on, go get the Frisbee.
what's wrong with you?
you see anything?
just keep your eyes peeled.
where does a mutt go?
take it easy.
he has a bladder condition. He can't control himself.
I got your bladder condition over here.
take it easy. Come on.
get your mutt out of here! Take a hike!
jeez, it stinks, Gino.
you think it'll stain?
spot!
Hey, help!
he stole her purse!
help!
there he is.
spot! -James, come here!
spot, come back!
sorry, man. That dog is totally psycho.
Where's that crazy dog?
there he is.
spot, no!
bad dog! What are you doing?
I' m sorry. He's not really my dog. I didn't know he was a thief!
what?
what's that?
listen, I said l'm sorry.
Oh, I get it. How much you want? Twenty bucks?
twenty-five bucks.
come on, that purse ain't worth more than that.
I said l'm sorry.
Hey, back off. What's the matter, lady?
Gordon, it's me again.
I can't believe it. This is terrible.
I made it out of the snow but all the roads are blocked.
the stupid bus is stuck. I don't know how I'll get back.
you really don't know how much I appreciate this.
you're a good man, Gordon.
Hey, Gordon?
you know what? I really hate asking this...
... but the thing is, James has this little trouble sleeping
I gotta go.
what's wrong?
I can't take it anymore!
I can't sleep! I can't eat! I'm an emotional wreck!
it's all right.
you're here now.
... I don't know how to tell you this.
are you wearing 11's dog tag? -He's feeling what l'm feeling.
I talked to Danvers.
he's only had one cup of kibbles today.
the dog? You came here to talk about the dog?
of course! He's my partner! I miss him!
we've never been apart this long.
he's always been a good eater, just like me, even when he was a puppy.
Murdoch...
...this is not healthy.
I want you to fly up there...
...check on him, and get this out of your system.
Really?
there you go. You do the crime, you do the time.
I told you he wouldn't like that.
of course he likes that.
that's what that sound means.
Yeah, right.
come on, it's bedtime.
just holler if you need anything.
good night, Spot.
are you kidding?
stupid dog!
what's the racket about?
okay, I get it.
jeez.
Oh, I'm glad you can sleep.
wait, my keys.
let's go, stupid.
come on, go already.
what now?
that's nasty. I' m not picking that up.
what's the big idea?
all right, I'm sorry I tied you to the furnace.
let me in.
all right-- Hey, where you going?
come back here!
Hey, where are you going? You stupid dog.
James!
Oh, God. Nasty.
God!
shut up down there!
I'm covered in caca!
God.
Oh, God.
James?
spot. Oh, God, l'm gonna kill you.
Oh, God!
come on.
got some l. D?
I. D?
I don't think so.
don't get wise, buddy.
listen, I live right here. The dog locked me out.
you been drinking?
no, I have not been drinking!
I'm taking care of the neighbor's kid...
...then this dog came!
came from where?
hell.
this is Satan's dog. I' m telling you! He gets mad at the drop of a hat!
he got pissed off and locked me out of my own house! He's crazy!
put your hands on your head! Put your hands on your head!
okay, let's just try to relax here.
he locked me out of my house.
Satan's dog locked you out?
Yeah.
you think I'd do this to myself?
Oh, boy. -Whoa, whoa.
come with us. We'll get someone who can help you.
not in my car. He reeks.
Oh, thank God! James! See, that's the kid!
and that's the dog!
son, do you know him?
that's Gordon. He lives here.
next time you step outside, sir, I suggest you take your keys.
Thanks, I'll remember that.
let me in the house!
this is crazy, Gino. Sonny will nail our heads together.
I say we get our passports, start to learn Spanish.
Arliss...
...you gotta focus.
all we gotta do is get in the dog's head.
so every place a dog has gotta go...
...we hang the posters.
sooner or later he's gotta show.
and when he does...
... bada-bing.
that's smart.
what are you doing?
you're doing it all wrong. Come on, check it out.
you gotta put a bunch of junk on it. Let me give you some style.
here you go.
Yeah, that's it. Yeah, get crazy.
girls love that.
that's the look.
Yeah.
see? That's got attitude.
Gordon, what was your daddy like?
my daddy?
well, I'm just like you. I don't have a daddy.
what about your mommy?
well, I didn't have a mommy either. -You didn't have a mommy?
Hey, man, it's cool.
I mean, look at Spot.
spot doesn't have a mommy or daddy.
he's a stray, but he's happy.
I mean, he's a little screwed up, but he's happy.
I' m sorry you didn't have a mommy, Gordon.
I didn't need a mommy.
if I did have one, she'd probably comb my hair like this.
make me look foolish.
mush! Come on!
Tigger, you made it.
it's Tiger, you moron!
you seem awfully happy to be here.
this is not a smile.
my face is frozen like this!
now, how's Agent 11?
that's not Agent 11!
well, that's the dog they sent us.
Cassavettes. -The dog that jumped out was Agent 11.
the tags were switched!
are you sure? -I'm positive.
it had to be Sharp.
forget it.
she's long gone.
okay, Spot, let's try it again.
listen up, Spot. I got no time for you.
and I know you don't like me either.
you're your own dog. You like to hang back.
I'm down with that.
but I'm here to talk about the kid.
see, his mom keeps him on a short leash.
you hear what I'm saying?
I'd like to see the kid have some fun.
let's go, Spot. Let's hook the kid up with some fun.
let's go! Let's go have some fun!
come on, let's go have some fun!
I' m sorry, James.
let's just go.
you should be ashamed of yourself. Come on.
what's he doing?
I don't know. Why don't you try throwing it?
how about that?
good boy, good boy.
here, come on, Spot.
come on, jump up.
come on, Spot. Good boy.
did you see how high he jumped? -Yeah, like five feet.
our boy can play!
he isn't retarded. -No, he's a smart dog.
Thanks, Spot. I owe you one.
what do you say we get him a bone or a snack or whatever dogs eat?
Hey! -Oh!
Oh! -Get out of here!
you believe these kids? -No respect.
Gino. Gino.
that's our mutt!
that's our mutt! -Let's go.
all right, you go get the dog...
...one of those-- Whatever he wants. I' m gonna ask this lady a question.
Hey, how's it going?
Starchild?
"Starchild ," are you serious?
you can have anything you want, Spot.
what about this one?
no.
hello.
cat got your tongue?
now, where did this mutt go?
Hey, kid! Where's that dog?
be careful. There's piranha in there.
you get the guns.
let's get that mutt.
No! I'm not paying for this!
spot?
spot, are you okay?
"can cause paralysis"?
I'll go the other way.
they got me.
help. Help!
Hey, kid.
how you doing?
want to help your Uncle Gino find the doggy?
Hey!
whoa. Help!
help!
you go that way.
that's it. It's over.
my legs!
Gordon? It's me again.
I'm just calling to check in.
are you there? I' m sure everything's fine.
if you want to, call me on my cell phone.
okay, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.
stop!
so Seattle, huh? -Yeah.
don't worry. We have lots of room.
we'll get you there. -We'll go straight there?
we' re not stopping for nothing.
well, there you are.
Oh, you're gonna be really comfy in there.
Oh, just don't make any fast movements.
what's that smell?
Hello?
Hi, Mr. Zebra.
I gotta report an attempted murder. -Yo, Granger!
you're catching!
this is just perfect.
so where did this happen?
at the pet store. There were two of them.
one was a real big guy, looking like Pavarotti.
I'm telling you, it was a hit.
a hit? And you were the target?
dude, not me, the dog.
the dog? -Spot was incredible.
he got the bad guys.
it was amazing. He just took those two guys out.
it's weird, I always thought he was retarded.
you know what? If you're asking me...
...you're the one who is retarded.
dude, he's not retarded. You are.
yeah? Well...
know what l'm thinking? -What?
when Stephanie returns, I'll tell her...
... not to leave James with a nut who gets her kid a dog while she's away.
actually, that's not his dog at all.
that's "Satan's dog.
let's leave. We don't need these idiots.
Oh, man.
come on, Spot.
looks like Agent Sharp skipped the country.
she did not.
we got ahold of all her credit card records.
she bought a one-way ticket to Belize.
she never made the airport.
and let me tell you something, if you don't get that dog...
...you're gonna make the airport. But as part of a runway!
Oh, we' re dead. We are so dead.
you know, I never saw Godfather III.
I heard it wasn't as good as the first two.
I thought we had more time, Gino.
Arliss, Arliss, listen to me.
take a rest. We're gonna find the dog.
Hey, Gino, I didn't think they let you out of Jersey.
what are you doing here? -What do you say, T ommy?
I just got a little business to finish up.
Oh, that's good. That's good. Great.
I can't stand that clown. He's got no respect.
hello. -Yeah, I know who's got your dog.
my neighbor. The guy's a freak.
they got the dog. We got the dog.
the bureau appreciates your help.
a canine agent disappeared in this area a few days ago.
we are intent on finding that dog.
what is it with the dogs all of a sudden?
I had this idiot in who said the Mafia put a contract out on his dog.
that's Agent 11.
Yeah, and...?
he's my partner, you greasy-haired reptile. Tell me everything.
I can't sleep.
why not, buddy? -I had a bad dream.
about what?
Charizard was trying to burn me, and I had to run away.
who's Charizard? -A Pokemon.
I thought Pikachu was the Pokemon.
there's all different Pokemon.
and they all have different powers? -You catch on fast.
and are they named after what they sort of do?
kind of.
okay, so if you were a Pokemon, you'd be Snotty-nose-achu.
you would be Stinky-feet-achu.
and you'd be Fart-in-bed-achu.
it wasn't me.
it wasn't me, either.
wait, if it wasn't me, and it wasn't you...
do you like my mom?
Yeah, yeah. I really do.
why don't you marry her?
well, because, you know, marriage is a big step.
you really gotta know someone before you do something like that.
you'd be fun for a dad.
you think so?
Thanks.
hold it. Hold it.
I think this is the block.
Yeah, let's go.
and they lived happily ever after......because they won the lottery and moved to Hawaii.
there you go.
don't hog all the blankets.
I am so glad this is off our plate.
Yeah, you look like you could use something off your plate.
have you seen any of these men?
Yeah. These two. They destroyed the pet store.
if there's any cost for the damages, they should be held responsible.
you're very lucky, Mr. Smith. These men are extremely dangerous.
you should be all right now that Agent 11 is with us. 11, let's go!
what?
no. -Spot's leaving?
I promised the dog to the kid. You can't take the dog.
don't take the dog. Look at the kid.
you can't take him. -Agent 11 is U. S. Government property.
but you can't take him.
come on, James.
spot doesn't belong to us.
I think he has to go back with these guys.
here we go, boy.
he doesn't like that.
come on.
don't go, Spot.
No!
you're gonna have to eat something. -l'm not eating till Spot comes back.
well, Spot's not coming back.
that's life. Get used to it.
James...
let's see.
you lost the dog.
the boy wants you dead.
no way you're getting jiggy with his mama.
that makes you a single man again, brother. Give it to me up top.
okay, leave me hanging. Okay, cool.
I'll remember that.
I need you to eat.
11, eat.
you're gonna be stupid and not do anything?
I am doing something. I'm moving on.
you should too. Listen, James, don't get attached to things.
lt only ends up messing with you. -But he's our dog.
no, he's a government official, much like myself.
no, he's our dog and he loves us.
know what? You're just a kid.
you know nothing. You're irrational!
no, you're stupid!
Ow! Jeez!
Hello! -Gordon, hi.
Oh, it's you.
you won't believe what I've been through, but l'm really close now.
every time you call, you got some lame excuse.
what's it this time? Dog ate your homework?
are you okay? Is everything all right?
and always with the questions.
all I want to know is, when are you gonna be here?!
Gordon, what happened?
I will not be treated like an irresponsible idiot.
you're the irresponsible one.
it's your fault!
I shouldn't be watching a dog...
...and I sure don't need some kid in my life.
stop!
you're taking me to my kid, now!
agent 11! He's escaped.
agent 11!
James.
all right, truce. Come out here.
come on, this isn't funny.
my kid. I lost my kid.
keep your mouth shut.
this is suicide.
how in the hell could you guys let Agent 11 escape?
you'll all be reprimanded. -Murdoch!
where you going?
to find my dog, and I know exactly where he went.
back to those two.
James, I thought you were dead. Get in the truck.
come on, buddy, get in the truck. -l'm gonna find Spot.
how you gonna find him? Think you're a detective?
why did you run away, James?
what do you care? You don't want me.
what?
no, I didn't mean it like that.
why did you say that to my mom?
you know, I was just scared.
and sometimes, when people get upset...
...it comes out all messed up.
do you miss Spot?
Yeah, I guess I do.
I' m really glad you ended up staying with me.
glad we became pals.
I didn't mean what I said to your ma. Not even a little bit.
think you could forgive me?
it's okay, Gordon. I'm glad we're friends.
me too.
there they are. Back it up.
Oh, no. It's those guys. Come on!
get back there! Hold on!
James, you okay? -Yeah.
throw those boxes at them. -All right!
dive bomb! Depth charge!
watch it! -I got it. I got it.
this mailman's gonna lose his job.
Where'd they go?
James, are you okay?
look what I found.
good idea. Come on.
police!
police!
help! 911!
help! Help!
James!
Oh, that's gotta hurt.
hurry, James!
Hey, get over here! Give me the dog!
Where's the dog? Get over here.
Gino, help me! Come on! Come on, Gino!
James, James. -Okay.
come on, get off.
help.
run!
I'll save you from calling the cops. We got one here.
sit down over there.
and you, shut up.
where is that mutt?
I thought he was with the FBl.
he escaped to be with you.
how touching. I'm all choked up.
could you loan me a handkerchief while we wait for the mutt?
Gino!
somebody help me here.
get off of me!
come here, you.
that's it.
Mr. Talia, what are you doing here?
I took a wild guess and figured you two baboons would screw it up.
sit down, the both of youse. -Sonny, the dog
lt wasn't our fault. -No?
I don't know if it's worth the bullets for the two of youse.
I gotta ask my accountant. Afterwards.
excuse me, Mr. Mob Boss Guy, I wouldn't make any sudden moves if I were you.
you wouldn't, you punk? Why not?
I don't think Spot would like that. -And who is Spot?
spot!
come on.
come on.
11, the gun!
you take it, Gino. -Whoa!
spot! -11!
I kick him, James!
run, James! Run!
no, not again! Come on!
Oh, no, not again.
Hey, Spot. -you're the greatest, Spot.
Hey, what do you got there, boy?
all right, get up!
scratchy, scratchy, good dog!
good boy. I love you.
agent 11...
...come on.
his name's Spot. He's staying with us.
open up your eyes, man. This dog's got a lot going on inside.
he just wants to be a dog, with a family.
he's never had a family before, and it's been really rough.
the FBl is his family.
the FBl is not a family. It's a job.
come on. He's got a chance to be happy now...
...with people that care about him.
I want to give him a home. I won't let you mess that up.
I think it's time that Spot decides what he wants.
I can't ask him. He's a dog.
let's just see. Let's see what he wants.
Oh, bud.
good boy, Spot.
what is it?
what do you want, boy?
what is it, boy?
I'll miss you too.
thanks for the ride.
Benny! Benny, what happened?
I don't believe anybody's dead.
gordon and James took down a mob boss and his henchmen.
gordon gonna need some help.
we need a SWAT team, man.
then you hit the guy in the head with the meatballs?
that was funny.
mom!
what's going on?!
Oh, my God!
Stephanie. You look great. -We had the greatest time!
gordon had me under his arm and then two bad guys with guns chased us.
there were dogs everywhere and this is Spot, the dog Gordon gave me.
you look like you had a hard trip. Maybe we should talk about this later.
if you ever come within 50 feet of my son, I'll call the police.
well, Stephanie, I live 25 feet away.
those came in very handy.
I can explain.
come on.
hey there, music man.
I' m gonna catch you in the yard. We're gonna settle this, man to man.
what's up, G? -Yo, what's up?
I' m all right. You know what, man?
he's not such a bad dog after all. -No, he's a good dog.
you really dug Stephanie, didn't you?
now she just sees you as unreliable, immature...
...irresponsible, fly-by-night, bad kid-watching dude.
you want a hug, man?
no, I'd rather not. I'll just take the dog to the park or something.
but thanks, man. -Go on and walk your dog.
all right. See you later.
do you like it? There you go. Thanks.
Hey!
spot!
I'm sorry.
what? What's this?
whoa, hey!
what's up, buddy? Trying to jump me?
Hey.
Hey, Spot. Hey, Spot...
you two turning to a life of crime now?
here. -Thanks.
so, you're a hero now.
James tells me you and Spot saved him from the bad guys.
I actually thought he was exaggerating because he likes you so much.
it's really true. He's an FBl agent. -I actually checked it out.
it sounds like you saved James' life too. Thank you.
listen, l...
...I think maybe I might have jumped to conclusions about you...
...and I wonder if you'd like to give it another shot.
lt? You mean us?
the two of us.
if you make it the three of us, l'm in.
okay! The four of us. Sorry.
come on.
I promised Father - I'd do something for them.
I am convinced your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all.
it is their house now, Marianne.
I have just heard from my brother Edward.
edward Fellows. How do you do?
he will be expected to marry a young lady of great fortune.
thank you, Fanny.
I am determined to leave this house before the week is out.
welcome to Devonshire.
we must see what we can do for them, eh?
lovers, husbands, that sort of thing.
Colonel Brandon, Miss Marianne Dashwood.
Eleanor, he's too old!
Colonel Brandon, do you know Mr Willoughby?
what do you think of this one?
Yes. That will do beautifully.
mama, it's two years old!
look now faded at as.
Louise... The muslin then?
that's not very old.
but he's seen me in it twice already.
there's nothing to wear!
why are we so poor?
mr Willoughby will be delighted with you in your old dress, Marianne.
he can't seem to take his eyes I off you whatever you wear.
well, perhaps...
dear Elinor, if I could borrow your yellow gloves...
course you could.
never knew you were a dancing man.
a word with you, Willoughby.
in private.
by all means.
I Well?
what are your intentions towards Miss Marianne Dashwood?
I beg your pardon?
I believe you heard me.
what are my intentions?
and what right have you to ask me?
I am not aware that you are a relation of the lady.
is she under your protection?
I have her interest at heart.
0h, you have, have you?
well, then, let me ask you this...
what are your intentions with regard to her?
whatever they are, they are entirely honourable.
can you say the same thing?
I cannot be blamed if Marianne I prefers my company to yours.
we are closer in age, in temperament, in taste...
in short, in everything.
I commiserate with you, but there it is.
and to answer your question, yes, of course my intentions I are entirely honourable.
you will excuse me now.
0h, I'm so happy, Elinor!
Yes, I think everybody is aware of that.
I believe you disapprove of me.
but how would you have me behave?
Oh, I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved.
I should have sat quietly and talked of nothing but the weather and roads.
no-one would expect that of you.
but to be so very open in your preference for Mr Willoughby, to the point of refusing l to dance with anybody else.
why should I hide my feelings?
they are true and honest.
don't be angry with me, Elinor.
I only wish you could be as happy as I am.
I am perfectly content.
you are not. You know you're not.
why doesn't Edward come?
I suppose, because he has other obligations.
or perhaps he simply prefers to be elsewhere.
how can you be so calm about it, Elinor?
would it serve any good Ifor me to be agitated?
I should lie s¬§bba¬§g and calling his name?
I think it's best not to h0pe too fervently for something I that may never happen.
then let me hope for you.
Elinor!
Elinor!
Elinor!
isn't she beautiful, Elinor?
she's the best presentl I could have wished for.
I bred her myself, Miss Dashwood.
docile, good-tempered, and exactly calculated to carry a woman.
I hope you'll share her with your sister.
I believe you both love to ride.
what do you think of her?
Oh, she's a lovely creature!
I just imagine, Elinor...
how delightful to gallop over the downs on her!
Yes, and it is very generous of you, Y Mr wlllolghby.
but Marianne cannot possibly accept such a gift.
Elinor, why ever not?
for reasons both of practicality and propriety.
excuse me, Mr Willoughby.
Elinor!
wait there.
why should I not have a horse?
because we cannctl afford to keep one.
we have no money for stabling, 0 P¬§$f¬§r¬§9??
you would need a servant to look after it, and another horse for the servant to ride.
the whole notion is impossible!
it is not!
I am sure it could I be done! Mamma, could it not?
it does seem a little harsh, Elinor.
if we economised on something else...
we economise on everything, Mamma!
we can barely afford meat, and sugar, and tea!
we are poor already.
do you want us to be destitute? - You have said enough!
but it is very humiliating to have to refuse.
I think Mr Willoughby will understand when he understands our circumstances.
and Marianne, it would not be proper to accept such a present Ifrom a man we know so little.
I Know so little?
I know him better than any other creature in the world, except you and Mamma.
and I understand him better. than I understand you at this moment!
girls
Mrs Dashwood.
forgive me?please??
there's nothing to forgive. - Yes.
I put you and your sister in an awkward position...
it was thoughtless of me.
I should have considered more carefully, and I beg your pardon for it.
but, Marianne, the horse is still yours.
I keep at only until you can claim it.
and when you leave Barton to form your own establishment,
queen Mab shall receive you.
get in there, Turk, get in there, Suki! Get on!
good shot, Brandon.
don't think I've ever seen you aim a gun and miss.
Willoughby's a good shot now.
very fair shot.
he generally brings home a good bag of birds.
mr Willoughby does everything well.
don't much care for the man, do you? - N0.
it's Marianne, ain't it?
I should be very sorry Ito see her injured.
injured?
no likelihood of that, I'd say.
but they're both very young, you know...
very young.
they may tire of each other byl the end of the season and then,
there you will still be.
and Miss Marianne a little older and a little wiser.
bide your time, Brandon...
bide your time, old friend.
that's my advice.
then she'll see the old dog I has some life in him yet.
I I'm obliged to you for your counsel.
now, now don't get on your high horse, man.
it was kindly meant.
0h, Lor, there they go!
Damn!
missed again.
but Elinor, now...
you might think of her, you know.
please let me.
Willoughby.
you have no scissors.
I brought some especially for the purpose.
I heard a noise outside.
can I get in with you?
if you're quiet.
Marianne's sleeping.
I was a bit frightened.
it was probably just a fox.
I thought there might be wolves.
no, there aren't any wolves in England, not for a hundred years.
there might be some left.
well, if there are, I won't let them get you.
stop making fun of me.
go to sleep then.
d'you like it here, Elinor?
Yes, well enough.
it isn't as nice as Norland, is it?
it's different.
0f course we all miss Norland.
but just think, tomorrow we are all invited Ito a picnic at Delaford.
and I've heard Colonel Brandon has peaches and strawberries in his greenhouses.
peaches and strawberries!
Yes.
so think about those delights. Goto sleep now.
now.
miss Marianne will go with Willoughby, no doubt.
his curricle only takes two, so who will go with me, and who with Brandon?
Colonel Brandon!
what's the matter, Brandon?
I am sorry to say our expedition I will have to be postponed.
I am called away on urgent personal l business.
I must leave at once.
Colonel Brandon, you wouldn't disappoint us?
defer your journey, Brandon?
not by an hour.
you will excuse me.
well, that's a dashed shame!
I wonder what his business could be?
there are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure.
he was afraid of catching cold, I dare say, and invented this to get out of it.
you are very hard, Mr Willoughby do you think so little of him?
he promised us a day of pleasure, and has broken his promise, out of ill humour.
I hope it is not an illness in the family.
I can guess what his business is!
it is about Miss Williams, I'm sure!
what do you say, Sirjohn?
I do not care to pry into another man's concerns.
well, let's not let Brandon spoil our pleasure!
we can still drive into I the countryside and enjoy I the fresh air, at least!
Excellent!
well said, Willoughby.
come on boys, hop in.
shall we go as a procession, or each at his own pace?
catch us if you can, Sir John!
well, I'll wager that's the last we'll see of them for an hour or two!
welcome to Allenham.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I hoped very much I that you would like it.
I had a particular reason I for hoping that you'd like it.
would you like to see inside?
of course I should, but is your aunt expecting us?
she is away on a short visit.
so if you d0n't mind l being unchaper0ned...
do you think I would care about such a thing?
I hate these stupid conventions.
so do I.
it's in a shockingly I neglected state.
the old lady keeps barely a quarter of the rooms in use.
but a couple of thousand would see it restored to its former glory.
it reminds me of - the Sleeping Beauty's palace.
exactly.
why did I never - think of that before?
waiting to be awakened.
I think I should take you back now.
Oh, dear, I'm sure they've fallen into some misfortune!
perhaps I should send out.
Ah, here they are at last!
Oh, thank cou. All well?
very well indeed, I should say!
now, Mr Willoughby, I have found you out, in spite of all your tricks.
I know where you've been all day.
why, driving about the country in my curicle.
I thought everybody knew that, ma'am.
Yes, yes, Mr Impudence, but where did you drive to?
I hope you liked your house, Miss Marianne.
it is a large one, I know.
and when I come to see you, I hope you'll have new-furnished it, for it wants it very much!
see how she blushes!
and where is the harm in that?
we happened to be driving in that direction,
miss Marianne Dashwood was curious to see the house and I was happy to show it to her.
and that is the whole story.
and ifl am to blame, I submit myself for punishment.
well.
after such a frank confession I think we may be merciful.
what do you say, my dear? Mrs Dashwood?
I am only glad that they are both I here with us, safe and sound.
I ' I would have told you,' but I wanted to see his house I and he wanted to show me.
if we were doing wrong I should have felt it at the time.
but it already exposed you and it's very impertinent remarks from Sirjohn and Mrsjennings.
Elinor, I don't care what those people think!
but I don't want you to disapprove of me.
I don't disapprove of YOU.
only some of your conduct.
perhaps it was rather ill-judged.
but oh, Ellie, I do love him!
and I have felt a presence, that disturbs me with the joy of elevated thoughts.
a sense sublime, of something far more deeply interfused, "Wh0se dwelling is the light of setting suns,'
and the round ocean...
and the living air.
beautiful.
why do they not announce their engagement?
everything about their conduct suggests that they are engaged in private, so why do they not make it public?
I know they are engaged.
I know, because he has a lock of her hair.
I saw him take it, then he kissed it, and folded it up in his handkerchief.
Margaret, would you tell Marianne it's time to come in.
how could Marianne allow such an intimacy, unless they were engaged?
perhaps marriage might not be in their power for the present.
but that's no reason why Willoughby shouldn't declare his intentions.
Mrs Dashwood.
I shall be paying my respectsl to my aunt tomorrow morning.
I hope I may call tomorrow Iafternoon, at about four.
first for a private conversation with Marianne and then for one with yourself?
yes... Yes, of course!
thank you.
I I'm tired.
why do people alwaysl make me go for walks with them?
because they love your company, my dear
I should say it is near half pastl four now, wouldn't you, Elinor?
look! There's Willoughby's horse!
be careful, Meg!
Marianne! We're home!
is anything the matter with her?
is she ill?
I hope not.
she is a little upset...
and I am extremely disappointed.
disappointed? She's never refused you?
mamma!
my disappointment is that I am unable to stay in Devonshire any longer.
my aunt has exercised the privilege of riches upon her poor dependent cousin, by sending me on business to London.
and must you go at once?
almost this moment.
Oh, what a shame!
of course you have your duty to your aunt,
I'm sure her business will not take you long, will it?
you are very kind, but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately.
my visits to Allenham are neverl repeated within the twelvemonth.
well, erm...
I won't press you to return here immediately.
only you can judge how far that would be pleasing to your aunt.
Mrs Dashwood.
my engagements at present are of such a nature that I dare not flatter myself I that
I will be able to return I within the foreseeable future.
goodbye.
Willoughby!
when are you coming back?
Marianne will want to know!
Willoughby!
I think I know what this is.
his aunt disapproves of his regard for Marianne, and has invented this business in town i¬§ MM - to get him away for a while.
and being dependent on her, he has to agree.
then why should he not have told us that?
out of delicacy, not wishing l to speak ill of his aunt.
he could have explained his situation without speaking ill anybody??
then what is your explanation?
do you doubt his love for Marianne?
no one could??
I cannot understand it.
if I were still mistress of Norland, my girls would never be treated like this.
Oh, my poor dear girl.
forgive me, Mamma.
it was the sudden shock, I had no idea of his going away.
I am sure...
I am sure he will find a way to come back and see us very soon.
Elinor.
can you not sleep either?
no.
Margaret came in with me and you know how she rolls about in her sleep.
I came down for a glass of water.
can I get you anything, Mamma?
N0, thank you, my dear.
what were you writing when I came down?
Oh, just a letter.
to john?
yes... No.
I was lying awake, and I c0uldn't get it out of my head, why Edward hasn't come to see us, I so I decided to invite him directly.
mamma, you mustn't do that.
now, why ever not?
he is our friend our true friend but perhaps he felt
he didn't have sufficient invitation to justify his coming...
he is a little shy ¬§¬§u uamuem. - No.
he knows he is welcome, - and he said that he would come soon. - So...
if he delays, or if he does not come at all, then it must be with good reason.
what reason could he possibly have not to come and visit us?
I don't know, but there must be some explanation.
and I do beg you, Mamma, not to embarrass him by pressing the invitation upon him.
we would not want him to come here reluctantly or unwillingly.
I am sure Edward would never be unwilling or reluctant to see us.
then please let him alone to come in his own good time.
good night, Mamma.
for I have learned to look on nature "Not as in the hourl of thoughtless youth "But hearing oftentimes the still, sad music of humanity...
Willoughby taught me that.
perhaps it would be easier if you tried not to think of him so much.
how could I do that?
he is with me all the time.
he is in me, Elinor.
you are so strange sometimes.
I sometimes wonder what I it can be like to be you.
very dull, no doubt.
look! Someone's coming.
it is Willoughby! I know it is!
Marianne, wait! I don't think it's him.
Elinor, it is Willoughby!
I knew how soon he would come!
it's Edward!
wait for me!
I can only stay one night,
but I hope I'll be none the less welcome for that.
have you come straight from London?
no, I have been in Devonshire a fortnight.
Yes, I was visiting some old friends near Plymouth.
for my sins.
not a joyful visit, then? - No.
though I have no-one to blame for that but myself.
I'm very happy to see you again.
and I you.
so how does Devonshire suit?
plenty of pleasant walks, I should thank.
do you have good company?
are the Middletons pleasant?
no, not at all.
we couldn't I be more unfortunately situated.
Marianne, how can you say that?
the Middletons have been very kind to us.
sir John is the friendliest host.
have you forgotten how many pleasant days we've enjoyed at Barton?
no, nor how many painful moments!
we're all sad just now because Will0ughby's gone.
Ah, right. I see.
so, Edward, what are your mother's intentions for you at present?
are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself?
no, I think even she is convinced now that I'm not destined for public life.
my brother Robert is the man for that.
so how are you goingl to distinguish yourself?
I shan't attempt it at all.
I have no wish to be distinguished.
you are distinguished to us, Edward.
and in any case, what have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness?
wealth has a good deal to do with at, nthank.
Elinor, for shame! Are we not happy?
have we not been happy here, and we as poor as the gypsies?
Yes, and I think we might've been even happier if we had a little more money.
I wish someone would give us I all a thousand pounds each!
Yes, that would be very welcome.
Elinor, you have no soul!
perhaps not, but I flatter myself do have a little sense.
what do you think, Edward?
do you believe money has anything to do with happiness?
money can solve some problems?
for others, it's completely useless.
Edward?
you seem unhappy.
do I? Forgive me. I am...
prone to these dark moods from time to time.
perhaps I should not have come here at all.
but I did want to see you all.
and we are very happy Ithat you have come.
we were waiting and waiting for you to come.
I am sorry that it took me so long.
I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward.
is that your sister's hair?
I thought her hair had been lighter.
Yes, it is Fanny's hair.
the setting casts a different shade on it, I suppose.
l I thought it was Thomas... our servant.
he's gone to the village.
I saw the logs.
I enjoy this work.
a man can relieve his feelings.
and you have very little help here.
we manage.
Yes, but if only...
what is it?
nothing.
nothing I can speak of.
I should never have come here.
goodbye!
goodbye!
that was your hair in Edward's ring, wasn't it?
it did look like my hair...
but he never asked mel for a lock of it, Marianne.
I am sure he still loves you as much as ever.
did he say anything to you?
did he speak of his love for you?
no.
what did he come here for, if not to propose to you?
I I don't know.
Hello! Hello!
we've brought you some strangers!
Hallooo! Hallooo!
where are you all?
are we never to have a moment to ourselves?
there you are!
what a surprise we have for you!
here is my other daughter Charlotte, and her husband, Mr Palmer!
I had no idea it could be them.
we heard the carriage, and thought it must be Colonel Brandon Mk?
Oh, what a delightful place.
I do love a cottage, don't you, my love?
I wanted Charlotte to stay home and rest, but she would come, she so longed to see you all!
she expects to be confined soon!
and our nieces, the Miss Steeles, I will be with us by the afternoon!
miss Lucy Steele is very eager to make the acquaintance of the Miss Dashwoods, you know!
so!
you are commanded to Barton Park for dinner!
but me no buts!
the carriage will be sent for you at four o'clock!
come along, Palmer!
that ceiling's very crooked.
miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne, Miss Margaret Dashwood,
allow me to introduce .
my second cousins by marriage, the Misses Steele.
don't you think they're a fine pair of pretty girls?
0h, Sirjohn, for shame!
how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?
have you found any smart beaux?
there cannot be so many here as there are in Sussex?
Anne, must you always be talking of beaux?
some young ladies d0n't care for them, but I think they're vastly agreeable, provided they dress smart and behave civil.
but I can not bear to see them I dirty and nasty, can you?
I Erm, no.
we've heard all about your sister's conquest,
and that Mr Willoughbyl is the smartest beau that I anyone could wish for,
and prodigious handsome too!
T'will be fine to have her married so young.
and I hope you may have I as good luck yourself soon...
but perhaps you have a friend in the corner already!
indeed she has, and he was I inthe neighbourhood very lately!
and what is his name, pray?
Oh, it is a great secret, but we I all know that it begins with F,
but more than that we cannot say!
we know a Mr Ferrars?
he's a very agreeable young man... we know him very well!
how can you say so, Anne?
we have seen him once or twice atl my uncle's, but it's rather too much Ito pretend to know him very well!
I always say the wrong thing!
Yes, you do.
look... The weather is much brighter!
I wonder, Miss Dashwood, I would you do me the honour of taking the air with me?
you will think my question an odd one, I dare say, Miss Dashwood...
but are you acquainted with yourl sister-in-law's mother, Mrs Ferrars?
no, I have never met her.
I never understood that you were connected with that family at all.
Oh, Miss Dashwood.
if I dared tell you all, you would be very much surprised.
Mrs Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present but the time may come when we will be very intimately connected.
what do you mean?
are you acquainted with Mr Robert Ferrars?
no, not with him!
I never saw him in my life!
but with his elder brother.
we are engaged.
Mr... Edward Ferrars?
of course you are surprisedl because it was always meant to be a great secret.
none of my relations know of it except Anne.
it would be terrible l if it reached his mother.
I have no fortune, you know, and I fancy she is a very proud woman.
may I ask if your engagement is of long standing?
we have been engaged these four years.
four years! - Yes.
I met him at my uncle's.
he's a schoolmaster and Edward was under his care.
because he lives in London we hardly see each other,
writing is our only comfort, except I have his picture and he has a lock of my hair that I gave him, set in a ring.
I wonder, did you notice it?
I did. Yes.
and you promise you will not breathe a word of this to a single soul?
miss Dashwood? Elinor?
you promise?
I never sought your confidence, Miss Steele...
but your secret is safe with me.
what was that long conversation with Lucy Steele all about?
nothing of consequence.
she was telling me her hopes and dreams for the future.
how very uninteresting.
Yes, quite.
Marianne, Elinor,
I have a mind I to spend a month or two in London, and I would be very glad to have your company!
IMamma!
you are very kind, ma'am, but I am sure our mother could not spare us.
Oh, indeed I could, I think it is an excellent scheme.
I should prefer to stay in Devonshire.
Oh, what formidable obstacle is my dear Elinor now to bring fonovard?
do not let me hear a word I about the expense of it.
I should like to go to London.
of course you would!
and I think we all know the reason why!
and I dare say Miss Elinor has just as good a reason, if the truth were known!
mamma? Do you really wish it?
I insist upon it.
come, Miss Elinor!
you can see your sister longs to go, and she longs for your company too!
no more demurrals, your mother and I have settled it all between us to town you shall go!
I am surprised at you, Marianne.
why is that?
freely volunteering for more of Mrs ]ennings' teasing.
I would bear more than that for a chance of seeing Willoughby.
I am surprised you are not more excited at the thought of seeing Edward.
perhaps we shall not see him.
he is very much at I his mother's disposal.
I'm sure we shall and very soon.
he loves you, Elinor.
he will find a way to see you,' whatever his mother might say.
for in a little while I shall see him!
I'm very happy for you.
and you will see Edward!
perhaps, perhaps not.
we're here!
well, here we are again.
here are the Misses Dashwood, and they are to be treated like royalty.
any little thing you want, Foot. will attend to it, won't you, Foot?
indeed, ma'am.
this will be your apartment.
it was dear Charlotte's before Mr Palmer took her away from me,
and I hope you'll be very comfortable in it.
look.
Charlotte made that picture out of coloured silks.
seven years at a great schooll in town, and that's all we have to show for it!
poor Charlotte.
well, I'll leave you to settle in.
dinner will be on the table in half-an-hour!
foot!
be so good as to take this to the post for me.
the penny post, Miss?
no, the twopenny.
very good, Miss.
well, how ever, we may see him this very evening.
you might as well come away Ifrom the window, my dear,
he won't come any sooner for your looking after him.
indeed, I think it's a little late for any visitors to come now, however eagerly expected!
it is not too late.
there...
was that a knock on the door?
next door, I fancy.
there!
well! I wonder who that can be!
it is Willoughby, I know it is!
Marianne, be still. It may not be him.
Colonel Brandon, ma'am.
forgive me... I...
excuse me!
is your sister ill, Miss Dashwood?
she is overtired, I think, from the journey.
Oh, Colonel!
I'm monstrous glad to see you.
we have not seen you since that day you disappointed us over the picnic.
I hope your urgent business was I completed all to your satisfaction?
thank you, ma'am.
what is done is done.
I wonder if I might have a moment in private with Miss Dashwood.
Yes, indeed.
I'll go and see how her sister does!
miss Dashwood, tell me.
I think I know the truth, but I want to know for certain.
am I to congratulate you?
I'm not sure what you mean.
your sister's engagement to Mr Willoughby is widely spoken of.
how can that be?
by whom have you heard it mentioned?
by everyone...
of our acquaintance.
I heard it first myself I at the Palmers.
I came to inquire.
miss Dashwood.
is everything finally settled?
I cannot tell you definitely that they are engaged.
neither of them has ever said so to me or to my mother.
but I would not wish to give you false hope.
I am quite sure that Marianne is deeply in love.
I And I have no reason to doubt I Mr Willoughby's feelings for her.
I do expect, and hope, to hear of their engagement very soon.
that being the case...
to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness.
and to Willoughby, that he may endeavour to deserve her.
good night.
Colonel Brandon was disappointed not to see you.
he did see me.
for about five seconds.
he has a great regard for you, Marianne.
Yes, and I for him, but he has one great defect.
he's not Willoughby.
Oh, why didn't he come?
foot?
are there any letters this morning?
no.
nothing for me, not even a note?
no, Miss. Sorry.
was you expecting one?
Oh, not particularly.
anything for me?
no, Miss.
are you quite sure of it?
no servants called? No messages?
nothing, Miss.
no, Miss. Sorry, Miss.
but here is something!
the Middletons are arrived, with the Miss Steeles, and we are invited to an evening assembly.
and you can be sure that Mr W will be invited too.
and perhaps Mr F as well!
I declare I've never seen anything like it.
this must be the finest party in town.
stay, Marianne, you have a lock coming loose.
never mind it, Elinor! Let us go in.
Oh, there's Charlotte.
look!
Oh, Miss Dashwood!
Oh, Miss Marianne!
london is full of smart beaux!
and some of them very rude and naughty!
we have been pushed and pummelled...
look at the nasty beasts!
how they preen and ogle!
I hope you will stay close by my side, Miss Dashwood.
I am in such a fever of anticipation I fear shall faint.
I have heard that he is here tonight!
whom do you mean?
why, who else but Mr Ferrars?
are you quite sure?
I was told for certain.
Elinor, Marianne.
it is so fearfully hot and crowded in this room,
I can hardly bear to stay a moment longer.
my younger brother, Mr Robert Ferrars.
miss Elinor Dashwood.
miss Marianne Dashwood.
enchanted.
my brother Edward has spoken very highly of your beauty, Miss Dashwood.
in general I consider him a very poorjudge of women, but in this instance, I have to concur.
you are very kind.
may I present Miss Lucy Steele?
charmed.
is your brother going to be here tonight, Mr Ferrars?
Edward? God, no.
the fellow shuns society.
hate to speak ill of me own blood, but my brother Edward is something of a hobbledehoy.
Oh, Mr Ferrars!
unkind!
Elinor, look! He is here!
why doesn't he come over and speak to me?
pray be composed.
don't let everybody know what you're feeling.
perhaps he saw me but not you.
it may be a difficult situation.
I don't understand.
come away.
he will come and find you, if he's able to.
No!
Willoughby!
excuse me.
miss Dashwood.
your mother is well, I trust?
Yes, thank you.
md. M. how long have you been in town?
good God, Willoughby!
what is the meaning of this?
have you not received my letters?
will you not shake hands with me?
but didn't you get my notes?
tell me, for heaven's sake, what is the matter?
Yes, I had the pleasure of I receiving the information I of your arrival in town, which you were so good as to send me.
excuse me.
Elinor. go to him...
tell him he must...
allow me.
take her hand.
come.
I have something to tell you about Willoughby which n think Q your sister should know.
how dare you have no idea of what I suffer.
I am all of a tremble.
in a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness depends on.
Mrs Ferrers, the person I hope one day to call mother.
miss Dashwood. Elinor.
every time we have met it has seemed impossible to say what I really think and feel.
Yes.
why do you not think badly of me?
what strange creatures men are.
what do they want from us?
miss Dashwood.
mr Willoughby, You're not welcome here.
where is your sister?
she's gone out walking.
Marianne!
Marianne!
I'm not even sure I saw him.
I just felt him.
spying on me from behind.
at least I think so.
how nice!
you never greet me this way anymore.
I should get home early every night.
your mom was great.
quite an actress.
you got off?
Yes.
if only I'd seen you through a hole in the wall.
are you Belen's boyfriend?
would you like him to be?
Yeah, sure.
then that's that.
I have to sleep at Luna's tonight. Her parents are going out.
I can ask if my boyfriend can come along.
she's really cool.
what's her name?
Elena.
well,
I'd prefer just to see you and Luna, no one else.
why the boyfriend?
can't they wait?
she asked me as a special favor. Maybe they can't.
they'll fuck. - Good for them.
we don't even know him. And in our bed?
you're just like your dog.
Hi, boyfriend. The doors are open.
be nice to him or I'll have you fixed.
you hear me?
delicious.
you're a great cook.
and what do you do?
you won't tell me?
I'll find out later.
I want some water.
before I met Luna I thought I'd never have kids.
wouldn't you want a daughter like her?
of course.
to me...
you'll always be my first.
and to you?
the first and only.
can I watch TV?
it's late, go to bed.
if Lorenzo tucks me in.
you'll have to show me where.
and a kiss?
can you tell stories? - Of course, that's my job.
did you know that island has the lowest moon?
that's right. But only a few of us in the world know it. It also has great weather, and it grants wishes.
if you need something, the rocks below the shore give it to you as a gift.
but watch out for the holes in the ground.
though it doesn't matter, because no one ever dies there.
for example, if you fall, you can choose any life you want.
you can be your favorite fish.
the island was glad when the girl arrived, especially the rocks below the shore, so they decided to give her something.
but what?
a raft.
bigger.
a dog.
no. Something she didn't have.
her father.
Bull's-eye, butterfly.
tonight you keep watch outside.
all she had to do was look everywhere for him until she found him.
her father could be whoever she wanted.
but then the girl had doubts, like everyone.
would she choose a lighthouse keeper or a fisherman?
she knew one thing: What she really wanted was her mother to become a beautiful mermaid.
she's asleep.
Belen, I want you to know something.
I changed into this, do you mind?
Hi, it's Elena.
is Belen there?
Yes.
it's Elena.
Hello?
how are you? - Better.
I'm improving.
and you?
well, I haven't cried.
I can't. I haven't seen her.
they told me, but I don't understand.
I don't want to imagine it. That's why I came here.
to be closer to her by swimming in the sea.
cry, Belen.
now that you can.
it helps me to hear you cry.
that's it.
cry.
cry.
you need to cry.
she hears you, too.
a big kiss from the sea...
from both of us.
lately you're always in bed.
you know what time it is?
it's a beautiful day. Sunny and clear.
and it's my day off.
get up, lazybones!
you need all these pills just to sleep?
you never had problems sleeping before.
Lorenzo, honey.
I'm worried about you. You've been depressed for days.
trouble with the novel?
is that it?
you look terrible.
something's happened.
what?
you're sweating.
I've left, and there's no coming back.
your life is more important than your novel.
than any novel.
writing is vital to you, but you need to take care of yourself.
you're too good a person to see the shit I have inside.
stop, that's enough.
I have a confession.
so you see how close I am.
I've been reading the novel.
everything you've written.
at night, when you're asleep. Do you mind?
I understand why you're so affected, why you reject it, and why it's hard for you to go on.
it can't be easy, living there, in that house, with that stormy relationship.
so much repressed desire, impossible to control.
he's coming between a mother and her daughter, breaking a sacred bond.
but the passion's there, too. The lust.
I identify with her.
I understand exactly how she feels.
disgusted, guilty, selfish...
her mom's jealousy...
but she's forced to choose between passionate love for a man, and love for a mother.
I'd have chosen the same. Such decisions are made by gut instinct.
sex...
the thick, burning lust filled the mother, the man and the daughter.
they were sex-crazed.
the stench of raw sex...
the mother and the man, the man and the daughter, the daughter and the man.
all the man's poisoned love...
alone with the daughter, the daughter and the man...
the smell was...
heavy, hot, overwhelming...
stuffy...
stale air.
exhausted...
the paint fell from the corners of the room and the walls became rocky, like those in a cave.
a filthy den of...
get out!
relax.
just wanted to let you know that I'm here.
the man was selfish, a coward.
he hated himself so deeply, so utterly, there wasn't even time for forgiveness.
only time for death.
death, death, death, death.
belen's fine.
she's home with her family.
forget the whole thing.
you've suffered enough.
will I ever read the novel?
of course.
another thing.
tell me about Elena, too.
my sister writes to her on-line.
she's on that Mediterranean cooking chat everyday.
her user name is "Alsi." - "Alsi"?
that's Spanish for "island" backwards.
Hi, Alsi. How are you?
I don't know you.
it's better that way. I'm here to help.
what's your user name?
I don't understand the icon.
it's a lighthouse for your island.
are you the keeper?
Yeah.
I have a story for you, it's full of advantages.
I'd like that.
Thanks.
the first advantage is at the end of the story.
it doesn't finish, it falls in a hole.
and the story starts again halfway.
the other advantage, and the biggest, is that you can change course along the way...
if you let me. If you give me time.
all the time you want.
go on, please.
to be continued.
what happened? Why are you so late?
my boss invited me to dinner.
he wanted me to try a new dish.
did you screw him?
what?
did you go to bed with him?
that's right, you guessed it.
and how was it?
tell me about it. - No.
you first.
what's going on?
what's your problem?
I lost track of you ages ago.
you're not alive!
was it the first time with him?
the second.
the first was before we met.
or should I say before I proposed?
so it doesn't count.
you could have told me before.
Yeah, I could have.
and today?
well...
it doesn't count, either.
it's a lie.
but we came close.
how close?
did you stop or did he?
what about you stopping with me?
Lorenzo, do you love me?
I need to hear you say it right now.
Yes. Deeply.
more than myself. But I'm lost.
then let me help you.
you don't deserve this.
why not? I'm your girlfriend, and I love you more than myself.
come on, it's obvious. You're draining my life away.
I'm doing all I can to get back, and accept myself, but if I can't, don't wait for me.
I wouldn't, either.
what happened to you?
Belen, it's Elena.
how are you?
it's real hot here.
why don't you come out? The sea will do you good.
I have a guesthouse for the whole summer.
I'll have a room free in August. Upstairs.
my best room. You'll watch the sunset from your bed. Bring someone if you want.
well?
the truth is, I'd love to visit an island...
with someone.
then that's it.
it's difficult, Elena. - Difficult?
nothing is here. All the bad's left behind.
just bring along the good. - Right.
the good up front.
I really want to see you, but here.
I don't want to lose touch.
say you'll come.
promise me.
I promise.
I'll try.
good bye.
forgive me, Lucia. I've got to end this.
I'm going to kill them for once and for all.
both of them.
right now.
if you've stopped being a writer, you have to explain why.
you're holding back.
if you don't tell me,
I'll never forgive you!
you hear me? Never!
I can't talk like this.
talk?
you're the one who won't talk.
you keep it all inside.
you won't let me help you.
everything's you.
I'm crumpled up in the corner.
look.
you were meant to live alone, and to suffer alone.
and to drive yourself fucking crazy, which I don't understand.
you're sick, Lorenzo.
sick of yourself, of your own standards, and nothing else.
of your fucking secrets!
you keep me around, but in the dark.
because my complaints don't count.
because you don't give a fuck what happens to me.
your troubles are so deep,
I'm fucking stupid, and all you care about is if I screw my boss or not.
I'm exhausted.
you're driving me nuts.
I'll be late to work.
enjoy your hole.
have fun rotting by yourself.
look, I've never been this mean to anyone.
it's the last time I'll let myself talk like this.
it's for me, not you.
that's right.
it's time to think of myself, of my own needs.
because I see no future with you.
Lucia!
come over here and lie next to me.
relax, Lucia.
let the mud absorb all the bad.
later it'll wash away in the sea.
I don't want sex.
I'm not ready yet.
don't worry.
we'll just lie here, drying out in the sun.
Yeah, he looks like Carlos.
missing for 6 months."
Manuela and Belen Lozano, mother and daughter, and Antonio Castillo, were all living together.
if anyone knows where they are, please contact the police.
the police?
we'II...
act like we didn't see this, like nothing's happened.
we know he lived with two women.
mother and daughter.
Yeah, and the daughter...
what?
the daughter was taking care of...
my daughter.
they left without him, quietly, without saying good bye.
as he slept, like in a dream.
when he woke, he felt the two lifeless women were still with him, like any morning at that hour.
and he lay still, wishing his life would also leave him, through his blood.
what good was his blood now?
he wished it softly, without real intent.
and he chose to escape, to start over, to be new.
to change his blood.
so he said good bye and left.
we should give him a chance.
don't we all deserve one?
just in case, if in doubt, isn't it better to trust people?
right?
so when he gets back, we'll ask him to explain.
it's better this way.
especially for you. - For me?
I just want to forget.
you can't forget some things.
in this house you can. That's why we're here.
then it's too late.
I should have come before.
when there was time...
for Lorenzo.
I wanted him to show me the island.
I asked him to, but he wouldn't.
it would have been his birthday soon.
what day? - The 23rd.
of May?
we could have celebrated here on the island.
maybe even with you.
who knows if we'd have met, right?
right.
when was Lorenzo here?
a long time ago.
before we met.
how long ago?
about six years ago.
Yeah.
I think he turned 25 here.
Lucia...
what is it?
I'm overwhelmed...
but I can't cry.
don't worry.
you don't have to.
I'm the one who should cry over him.
I'll just faint, then.
it's the sea.
must be high tide.
I'll never cry again.
I'm going to bed.
what's going on?
Luna, spring of 1988."
Luna.
why bother being a father if she didn't know?
he knew then that if he'd told her, she'd have kept the secret.
Lucia, never talk to me about this.
I don't want to hear it.
well, I do.
he's out diving.
beneath the island.
do you like Carlos?
I don't anymore.
go ahead, he's all yours. I won't even be jealous.
what are you doing?
asking a friend for advice.
I don't know him, but I'm getting to like him.
he's been writing me since I got here. He made up a sweet story to help me.
he taught me to forget.
and to escape pain.
want to read it?
you could get into it.
it's full of advantages.
because in the end...
there's a hole to escape through.
back to the middle.
to change course, if you want.
that's his icon, it's a lighthouse.
but it has no keeper, it must be a computer.
maybe his.
you'll meet my daughter.
I can't read this.
why not?
it will grab me.
and won't let go.
that's good.
did you finally do it?
do what?
change course?
not all the way, there wasn't time.
that's why I'm writing him.
Where's THE KEEPER?
don't write him.
there's nothing more he can do.
has he written you since I first got here?
Hi, Lorenzo. How are you?
your face says it all.
they called to say you were more awake.
do you know who I am?
Pepe.
thank God.
glad to have you back. You'll be writing in no time.
Where's Lucia?
it says here that your craneal hematoma has subsided.
and the rest of your bruises are history.
Where's Lucia?
you were in bad shape.
we didn't think you'd make it.
how long have I been here?
well...
one week in a coma, with this horrible respirator...
and two more weeks breathing on your own, but unconscious.
and in this room since four or five days ago, blabbering in your sleep.
and when you'd wake up, you were out of it.
we haven't heard from Lucia.
I looked everywhere.
she hasn't been to your place, nor the restaurant, since the night of your accident.
Lorenzo.
I think Lucia believes you're dead.
that's why she left.
I talked to the ambulance guy.
he said a cop called your house and talked to her.
he mentioned the car and she hung up.
he tried to call back but she wouldn't answer.
I need to pee.
do it there, - in the pan. - No way!
wait, wait.
Thanks, Pepe, but I can manage.
lose the attitude.
I've helped you all week.
you just don't remember.
I know where she might be.
you came by car?
as soon as they called.
good morning.
tell me right now why you're here and Belen isn't.
you see?
I don't want to forget anymore. Thanks to you, honey.
well?
won't you answer me?
it's time to show you who I really am, no more stories.
were you there with Belen, in my room, when that fucking dog killed my daughter?
it wasn't me. - It wasn't?
then why are the cops looking for you?
Belen was with some guy who met her in the park with your daughter.
but he disappeared after that night.
what about Belen?
where is she? Since you know everything.
she left with her mom but didn't tell me where.
she changed in the end, and chose her mom over me.
can't blame her.
a mother always comes first.
I don't trust you anymore, Antonio...
I won't ask you any more questions.
I'll leave that to the police.
lying to them won't be so easy.
look how brave I got all of a sudden.
wait.
please don't call the police.
why not?
are you holding back anything else?
I've no one left who I can trust.
where are you going?
making a getaway?
they'll track you down!
if you call the cops,
I'll leave, too.
are you stupid?
Yes.
where are you going?
I don't understand.
I trust Carlos, and I believe him. I want to know more.
that's the easy part.
believing what you want.
what pleases you.
I did that, too. Until tonight.
I'll chase whomever I please!
men matter less and less to me.
that's my lot.
they've never given me anything.
except sex.
no? What about the keeper?
what? Besides wild sex and a daughter?
don't forget that story full of advantages that he wrote just for you!
that's right.
maybe your boyfriend was the last - good man on earth. - No, he wasn't.
you're wrong, but that's my business.
and I suppose Carlos is also your business.
yours alone.
you're the only one chasing him.
Yeah.
come to think of it,
I always chase men. When I like them.
to each his own, right?
where could he be?
I don't know. I'm going home.
you guys cook tonight.
I'm so sorry.
Carlos! It's me, Lucia.
I want to come down.
come and help me.
I know how to dive, too. What did you think?
Lucia. It's me, Elena.
Where's Carlos?
down there.
did he escape?
maybe he's dead.
if he turns up, we have to believe him, okay?
whatever you want.
that's right.
he's a crab.
let's go home.
what for?
to eat.
so early?
I'm not hungry.
tough. It's about time you helped me cook.
we'll make a special meal and we'll be together and have fun.
you're a gift to this earth.
Elena. You're crying.
tears of happiness, which is what I am from now on.
great. I hope it's contagious.
piece of cake. Let's go.
the first advantage is at the end of the story.
it doesn't finish, it falls in a hole.
and the story starts again halfway.
the other advantage, and the biggest, is that you can change course along the way...
if you let me. If you give me time.
a ray of sunshine...
year after year. 20-something women come to new york city in search of the two L 's
labels and love.
Yeah. -He's the best.
hot dress!
twenty years ago. I was one of them.
having gotten the knack for labels early.
I concentrated on my search for love.
turns out. A knockoff is not as easy to spot when it comes to love.
what? You're married?
you fucking asshole! Motherfucker, you're married?
until it is. -I fucking hate you.
that is why you need help to spot them.
lots of help.
help also known as Charlotte York...
Miranda Hobbes...
and Samantha Jones.
Oh, my god, look at his.
Oh, well.
my name is Carrie Bradshaw. And I'm a writer.
year after year. My single girlfriends were my salvation.
and as it turns out my meal ticket.
I've been dating since I was 15 I'm exhausted.
where is he?
Charlotte was looking for the perfect love.
Trey can't get it up. -Well. Almost perfect.
I'm becoming a Jew.
we're not barren, we're reproductively challenged.
they're giving us a baby. -That's our baby.
so Charlotte and Harry journeyed to china and back......
for their daughter. Lily.
Miranda was a disciple of tough love.
Bye. Great sex.
Steve, I'm pregnant. -You're what?
Carrie.
I, Miranda Hobbes, take you, Steve Brady...
and Miranda journeyed to brooklyn for Brady and Steve.
who wants a popsicle?
Oh, man. Boy.
Samantha's love was sex.
lots of sex.
I'm dating a guy with the funkiest-tasting spunk.
can I cancel my rice pudding?
and then she found a man that combined sex and love.
I'm gonna help you be a star.
Yes, he is interested...
so Samantha journeyed to hollywood with television star Smith Jerrod.
as for me. I was looking for something big.
get in.
Mr. Big. turns out when that big love comes along.
it's not always easy.
just tell me I'm the one.
and despite all the other chapters of my life...
...no one was ever quite big enough until...
Carrie, you're the one.
and just like that. I was.
three books and three years later...
we still feel like those four single girls.
and even though time had moved us on...
I managed to stay exactly where I was
in love.
thank you. -You're welcome.
I got a good feeling about this one, kid.
Oh, I hope so. I've always loved this block.
Hi, 3c?
finding the perfect apartment in new york city...
is like finding the perfect partner. It can take years.
so how many is this? -Thirty-three.
lucky 33.
the worst. I just left you a message.
and the kitchen's through here.
that's the window with the best view.
Thirty-four? Lucky 34?
well, if anything else opens up, let us know.
we're very interested in this building.
I do have another apartment that's not even on the market yet.
care to take a look?
sure. -Sure.
all right, then.
it's more than you were looking to pay.
how much more? -More.
so this is where they keep the light.
Oh, my god.
I have died and gone to real-estate heaven.
just a simple home for two.
and across the rooftop terrace...
what, Nirvana?
hello. I live here.
your wife has quite a sense of humor.
they're not married. -He's my boyfriend.
this way.
aren't I a little old to be introduced as your boyfriend?
point taken. From now on, you'll be my man-friend.
that sounds like a dog. -Well, if the shoe fits...
and this is the master bedroom.
it's hideous. I hate it. Hurts my eyes.
how is this place even available? -Nasty divorce.
if you live here, what is there to fight about?
well, now I understand the divorce.
I can build you a better closet.
welcome home, baby.
can...? Can we afford this?
I got it.
okay, let's sign some contracts.
I got it." Just like that.
like he was picking up a check for coffee.
it sounds perfect.
except for the closet, which Big says he can redo.
and he says the kitchen needs work.
of course, I don't know about that because I keep sweaters in my stove.
so he bought it and you'll live there with him.
Yes, together. That's right.
but he'll own it, so you're keeping your own place, right?
I haven't figured out the details, but yes I'm a smart girl.
and I'm sure I'll figure out something that I'm comfortable with.
I just wanna be sure that you're being smart here.
and I love you for that.
but for now, can't you stop worrying for me...
and just go ahead and feel what I want you to feel, jealous?
Oh jealous of me living in this gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.
all right, I'm jealous. -Thanks.
you live in real-estate heaven and I live in brooklyn.
new york magazine said brooklyn is the new manhattan.
whoever wrote that lives in brooklyn.
Hey, there she is. Hey, hollywood.
Oh, lady. Hi.
how was your flight? -Fabulous.
let's go in. I'm so excited. Show us.
it was a rare occasion that brought all types of New York women together.
sorry.
Blair Eikenn was a waitress turned model turned actress turned billionaire's girlfriend who came home one night to find herself unceremoniously turned out on the street.
and now she was getting the ultimate breakup revenge
an embarrassing and very public auction...
of all the jewelry he had given her when they were happy.
there it is. My baby.
Oh, she's a beauty.
when I saw it in the catalog, and I said to Smith,
this flower ring is the essence of me.
one of a kind, filled with fire.
and a little too much. -Exactly.
let's go spend some of my hard-earned hollywood money.
and now lot 39, the flower ring.
that's it.
we'd like to start the bidding on this at $10, 000, please.
at ten-thousand doll... thank you, madam. At 10, 000.
fifteen thousand. At $ 15, 000.
Hey, she's bidding for somebody on the phone.
that's not fair. Bitch.
the gloves are off.
at $30, 000. Now it's against you. Thirty-five thousand.
I work hard, I deserve this. -At 40, 000 now.
at 40? forty thousand? Forty thousand, thank you.
forty-five thousand. At $45, 000. Now 50, 000?
fifty fucking thousand.
at 50, 000. Fifty-five thousand? At $55, 000 against you.
would you like to say 60?
sixty to our colorful bidder? At 60, 000?
I draw the line at 50.
I thought this auction would be more fun, but it's kind of sad.
isn't it?
I thought it was just sad for me because I know her.
but it really is sad, huh?
and it's funny because they were so happy.
Yeah, till they weren't. -I know, right?
we all told her to get married but she didn't wanna listen.
he'd been married three times before so she let it ride...
and then she came home one night and he had locked her out.
she didn't even have anywhere to live.
such a shame. After 10 years.
she was a smart girl...
till she fell in love.
I'm thinking...
l'm going to sell my apartment...
and put the money towards heaven on 5th.
Why? You love your apartment.
I know, but there's plenty of room in the new place and...
and besides, I...
I want to make us a life there.
you know, I... I want it to be ours.
it is ours. I bought it for us.
and that's so amazing, but you bought it.
so really it's your place and if anything were to happen...
what's going to happen?
come on, I have to be smart here.
we're not married, I'd have no legal rights...
...you know, to... to this home that I built...
with you.
did you wanna get married?
well, I didn't... I didn't think that was an option.
what if it was an option?
Why? What, do you wanna get married?
I wouldn't mind being married to you.
would you mind being married to me?
no. no, not if... not if that's what you wanted.
I mean, is...? Is that what you want?
I want you.
so...
so...?
Really? We're...? We're getting married?
we're getting married.
should we get you a diamond? -No, no.
just get me a really big closet.
so the other night big and I were talking about...
you know, moving in together and our future...
and, you know, what makes sense as we move forward and...
well...
we decided to get married.
and I'm deaf. -I'm so excited!
everybody is looking. -Sorry!
I'm so sorry, everyone...
but this is my friend and she just got engaged.
and she has been going out with the man for 10 years.
I'm mortified.
there is literally a ringing in my ear.
and the big news was about to go bicoastal.
Samantha Jones.
well, I made a little decision I hope you'll be happy about.
Oh, honey, you finally got Botox.
no, I did not get Botox.
I'm telling you, Carrie, you're gonna love it.
I did not call...
to talk about botox. -Well, I'm just saying.
so last week...
after the auction. I started thinking about my options.
right. -And, um...
well, Big and I decided to get married.
Really? -Yeah.
well, that's great.
you sounded more excited about the botox.
honey, I am excited for you, but you know me.
I don't really believe in marriage.
now, botox, on the other hand, that works every time.
honey, I... I gotta go.
we can catch up when I'm in town next week.
I think I was in shock.
I mean. It's you getting married.
this is not some random person, it's you.
Yeah, I hear you.
I thought that after that big mess with Aidan,
you'd never wanna get married.
so I put you in my "we're never getting married" file.
now I'm gonna have to take you out of that file.
well, I'm sorry about all the extra paperwork.
you'll get my bill.
Samantha, it just feels so different this time.
you know, there is no cliche romantic kneeing on one knee
it's just...
two grownups making a decision about spending their lives together.
well, I'm happy for you.
Oh, and hey, one more thing.
I want you to be maid of honor.
how do you feel about that?
the same with you feel about botox.
painful and unnecessary.
74, 75, 76. Seventy-six guests.
seventy-five sounds better.
a small wedding of 75 guests.
seventy-six trombones, yes. Seventy-six guests, no.
as a wedding gift. Charlotte had given me...
...Anthony Marantino. Friend and wedding planner.
all right.
well, that's...
cutthroat. I love it. I hope you're this decisive...
when it comes to location and the dress. -I found the dress.
what? When? -Yeah, the other day. I have it.
this is gonna be good. -I am so excited.
okay.
here it is.
that was the exact reaction I was aiming for.
it's pretty, but it's... it's so simple.
it's simple and classic.
when I saw it,
I thought, that is what I should marry big in.
well, who's it by? What's the label? -No one.
I found it at a vintage shop.
the bride wore a dress by no one.
Oh, come on, you know I'm gonna merchandise it up...
style it up with some shoes. Right.
the invitation is fancier than the dress.
I heard that. -I meant you to.
don't tell anyone.
the ultimate single gal. Carrie Bradshaw.
will be married in Manolos...
to new york financier John James Preston come fall.
our wedding's on page six. -Who would put that in there?
proving to single gals everywhere
that there can be a happy ending over 40.
Carrie. -Congratulations.
it seemed everywhere I went. People had seen page six.
even people you didn't expect.
like my vogue editor. Enid.
we're putting together our annual age issue...
and we'd like you to do 40.
great. Who am I interviewing? -No.
you. You are 40.
I want you to be featured in the magazine as the 40-year-old...
and here's the brilliant twist. Bride.
wait, I'm... I would be in the magazine?
in bridal couture. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...
so spare me a week of faux soul-searching and just say yes.
Enid, I am so very flattered, but honestly, l...
Carrie, vogue designers.
vogue photographers.
vogue airbrushing.
nod your head. Yes.
thank you. It will be a sensation.
we're calling it "the last single girl.
well, I'm hardly the last single girl.
no, but 40 is the last age a woman can be photographed in a wedding gown...
without the unintended diane arbus subtext.
I thought the issue was "great style at every age.
style, yes. Bride, no.
just your typical wednesday.
hanging out with old friends like stanford blatch...
and new friends like vera wang.
she's looking at home for someone who didn't think she had the bride gene.
well, I guess with the right man...
and the right dress.
when I get married, I'm wearing something like that only bigger.
beauty. Hot.
and Carolina Herrera.
nothing fancy, but it's beautiful. Good work.
and Christian Lacroix.
and Lanvin.
and Dior.
and Oscar de la Renta.
and finally. Vivienne Westwood.
a dress so special...
it could bring a wedding tear from even the most unbelieving of women.
and then. The impossible happened.
dear Carrie, I saw your photo from theVogue shoot.
this dress belongs to you. Vivienne Westwood
and just like that...
...Vivienne Westwood kicked my sweet little suit's ass.
lean?
are you the last person in new york still taking out library books?
I love the smell.
Oh. That's an oldie.
love letters of great men. Volume one.
Oh, am I in there? -No, no.
but some of your classmates are, like Voltaire, Napoleon.
young lady, you need to get glasses.
no, I don't. I have yours.
okay, here's Napoleon.
my dearest Josephine,
I wake consumed with thoughts of you.
typical short guy. Gives it all away upfront.
why are you reading this?
it's research for my new book.
Oh. what's it about? -Love.
I used to write about finding love.
now I wanna write about what happens after you've found it.
interesting.
what happens? -Mm. Stay tuned.
Oh, here, listen. It's Beethoven.
bring it, Ludwig.
my thoughts go out to you, my immortal beloved.
I can live only wholly with you or not at all.
good stuff.
be calm my life, my all.
only by calm consideration of our existence...
can we achieve our purpose to live together.
Oh, continue to love me.
never misjudge the most faithful heart of your beloved.
ever thine. Ever mine. Ever ours.
have you ever written me a love letter?
does a love fax count?
when have I ever gotten a love fax?
Oh, I'm sure my secretary sent you one at some point. -Yeah.
what can I tell you, baby? It's not my style.
besides, those guys had to write.
they were separated from their loves...
by wars and hundreds and hundreds of miles.
I'm right here.
hello.
you make me very happy. -Yeah. Put it in writing.
with my mind prenuptially preoccupied.
I became delinquent with my library books.
so now the tragic love stories of wuthering heights and love story were going to cost me more than a few tears.
excuse me, which way is the wedding?
up the stairs.
it was perfect.
big and I would be married in the classic new york landmark...
that housed all the great love stories.
where is the waiter with the check?
jeez, Miranda, relax. Magda hasn't even finished yet.
I still have a brief to work on when I get home.
I have to go to the bathroom. -I'll take him.
thank you, Magda.
we're gonna wash that beautiful face. Come, darling.
what?
we can't let the hard-working nanny finish her supper?
I'm sorry, I'm exhausted. Brady woke me up at 5 a. m.
Hey, he woke me up too. -Yeah.
we gotta stop letting Brady come into our bed.
you got milk on your top lip.
what now?
it's like you're always criticizing me. -I am not.
you wanna go through life with foam
on your lip and no one ever telling you?
anything you wanna tell me?
hm. Is there anything you wanna tell me?
wait. Wait. Don't come already.
no, wait. Get on top.
let's just get it over with.
I mean, we gotta get up in four and a half hours.
we never have sex and you wanna get it over with?
Steve, we have sex. -When was the last time we had sex?
there was snow on the ground.
how often do you guys have sex? -Sex.
Miranda, please. -What?
she's 3. She doesn't know what it means.
I'm 41 and I still don't know what it means.
I know, but she is repeating everything.
if I'd known the girl talk was gonna be on lockdown,
I wouldn't have flown 3000 miles.
no, we can talk. Let's just not use that word.
fine. How often do you guys?
color? -Thank you.
I can't color enough.
I could color all day every day.
if I had my way, I would use every crayon in my box.
we get it. You love to color.
why are you asking?
well, last night Steve and I were coloring, and I was just about to...come. I'm sorry, there's no crayon equivalent.
and he wanted to switch positions, and I said, let's just get it over with.
he kept trying to make it last longer. -This is bad?
it is when you have a full-time job.
I have a full-time job.
you don't also have a 5-year-old, play dates, PTA meetings...
and a mother-in-law in a rest home with advancing alzheimer's.
we're just going through a no-coloring phase.
it comes and goes, right? -Every couple is different.
Harry and I make love two, three times a week.
great, now I feel worse.
well, when was the last time for you?
six months ago. -Oh, my.
it sounds long.
but... but that's a dry spell. -I bet it is.
Hey, Carrie. what about you and big?
come on. I told. Tell.
but I will tell you this.
when big colors...
he rarely stays inside the lines.
well, this has been very helpful.
John?
come here.
totally outside the lines.
well, send it to Smith Jerrod at the office address.
I gotta go. Something just came up.
I got a gift for you. -So far, I like it.
How'd...?
wait. That was you on the phone at the auction.
I knew how much you wanted it.
but I was gonna buy it for myself.
well, I wanted to give it to you.
for our anniversary.
we met five years ago today.
right.
do you like it?
well, just to be clear, this is a ring with diamonds...
it's not a diamond ring, right? -Yeah.
well, in that case, I love it.
it's my second favorite thing I've ever found in there.
now, my gift is a little bit more oral.
babe, I have to go to bed. -Bed? It's 7: 30.
I have to be at the studio by 6 a. m.
and I need to get a workout in before that.
you see, this is how it starts.
next thing you know, we're only having sex three or four times a week.
and that is how Samantha learned she had a new neighbor.
from then on. Night after night...
while Smith got his beauty sleep...
Samantha found something more interesting to watch than Tivo.
keep going. -Okay.
keep them closed. -Okay.
okay. Open them.
double doors.
so far, so good.
Oh, my god.
Oh, you did me proud, mister. -You like it?
like it?
it's love at first sight.
Oh, my.
here. Wait.
hold this.
now I believe this is all really happening.
I can't believe your apartment sold so fast.
it's a sign. -Yeah, it's a sign I priced it too low.
Hey, that's the food. Will you buzz them in?
and money's on the table.
I'm gonna get started on the closet.
I should be done in about 17 years.
pink posted Take.
purple Toss. Yellow Storage.
Oh, you're very good friends.
Oh, my god.
I can't believe it. Lily, look who it is. Aunt Samantha.
what are you doing here?
a lot of shit went down in this place.
attention must be paid.
really, champagne.
remember this? -Oh, yeah.
while Samantha put on the best of the '80s...
...I put on the worst.
banana clip.
toss Take Toss
work it.
Madonna.
take Toss Toss
no fun.
take Take Take
it took four friends three days...
...to put 20 years into 38 boxes.
while I run over to see your mother tomorrow...
maybe you could take Brady by the first Birthday Party alone.
and then I'll meet you at the twins' party,
and you can leave and be at the bar by 6.
what's the matter?
I had sex with someone else.
and you're so amazing...
and I don't know how I could do that to you.
you and I hadn't had sex in a really long time and I...
God.
it didn't mean anything. It just happened once.
and it's been killing me.
it's killing you?
it just happened.
I... I...
I... I... I wasn't thinking.
do not follow me.
scout, off.
Miranda, it's still me.
is it?
Steve. I just... I can't believe it.
that's what I said. -Yes, it's sad.
but I'm not gonna make it any sadder by staying at a bad hotel...
while I look for a place. Could you pass the salt?
Plus, I have to be downtown and close to brooklyn.
we're gonna keep Brady's life as normal as we possibly can.
I'm gonna have him on my days and Steve will have him on his...
and Magda will shuttle back and forth between.
well, I don't really know if this question is allowed...
but how is Steve handling this?
says he's devastated, begs me to forgive him.
it's not gonna happen. I can barely even look at him.
Miranda, honey, are you sure you wanna do this?
it's just one time. Anyone can have a slip.
even if I could get my mind around that justification,
it's the cheating part.
the behind-my-back part, the violation of the trust.
that's what's killing me.
thank you for being you.
Charlotte made love to Harry four times that week.
okay. Wedding crunch time.
we need to get really serious here.
okay, not now. I just got an e-mail from our contractor.
he's pushed the move-in date yet again.
I gotta write this guy and... -No, no, no.
no. Wedding before contractor, all right?
unless you're planning to invite him, which would make the guest list 201.
two hundred? Jesus, Carrie, it went up again?
it's the dress. -You said 75 people.
how can I explain this?
look...
you play poker, right?
well, the dress upped the ante.
how you doing on your vows?
you'll be saying these in front of a lot of people, so the pressure is really on.
all right, up. I have to finish this. up.
Hey. -I don't have time for this.
you're not taking it seriously.
no, no, I'm not. It is a circus.
two hundred people?
page six?
this is my third marriage.
how do you think that makes me look?
I didn't know that was even an issue.
so why didn't you say anything sooner?
you wanted all of this. -Well, yeah.
but don't you want...? -I want you.
that's what I want.
I could have just gone down to city hall.
I think it's too late for city hall now.
well, no, I wasn't suggesting that...
I was just saying.
see, that's the face...
l've been trying to avoid.
come here.
you're a great man-friend.
and soon. It was the night before the big day.
there they are.
now, I know it's tradition at the rehearsal dinner...
for the maid of honor to reveal embarrassing things about the bride.
but in our group, we never kiss and tell.
so I'd like to make a toast to the groom.
there's a word he's heard before.
who's that guy again? -Karl. He's a partner at the firm.
Karl's kind of a jerk.
you know what they say, three time's a charm.
Hey, dickwad, I'm speaking.
Yeah, Samantha. -Yeah.
now, there were times when we had our doubts about this gorgeous man.
but after careful observation over the last hundred years...
my doubts are over.
so here's to the groom...
a man who finally got "Carrie-d" away.
here's hoping, John.
that is a jackass. Here.
Cheers. -That was really nice. Thank you.
there's nothing like an illegal cuban cigar...
after dinner, huh? -Exactly.
so that was quite a toast, Samantha.
well, you're quite a guy.
Oh, my god, there's a cab. Oh, yeah.
Steve.
I don't wanna bother you all. -You're not bothering us.
but...
I need to talk to Miranda.
Samantha, could you ask her to come out?
I don't wanna go in. It's a party and all.
sure.
Hey. I haven't talked to you all night.
Steve's here.
Hey, guys. Would you give us?
Yeah, sure, going in.
you're all right?
you didn't leave me any choice. You won't return my calls.
you only talk to me in front of the baby and I can't say anything.
what could you possibly have to say that could make it any better?
please. It was just that one time. -You broke us!
you broke us. What we had is broken.
what the fuck is happening?
I changed who I was for you.
are you all right? -No, I'm not all right.
you two are crazy to get married. Marriage ruins everything.
Hey. There you are. I thought you'd skipped out on me.
no.
well, the all-gal sleepover's about to commence.
Hey, is everything okay?
Yeah. I'm just tired, I guess.
all right. Well, go home and go to sleep.
but first give me a kiss good night and make it a good one...
because it's the last single-girl kiss.
I always knew she would marry big. -Oh, you did not.
that's crazy. -Yes, I did.
after every breakup I secretly thought, "Nope. They belong together.
you thought that after the second breakup?
Yup. -After the fifteenth?
Ha-ha. That's hilarious. We broke up a lot.
Yeah, but after the breakups comes the hot make-up sex.
Hey, you wanna get that? Open up.
now say something. -Sex.
are you sure she's not my child?
Hello? -It's me.
Oh, my god, did you just hear Lily?
I need to talk. -What?
I'm sitting here trying to write these vows and...
is this something we really wanna do?
Hey, you know what? You guys, it's Big.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna take it.
get some sleep, groomie.
what's the matter? -It's just...
everything is great as it is.
I don't wanna screw it up. -You won't.
I screwed it up twice before.
here's the thing.
this is me you're marrying tomorrow.
me. It's nobody else.
yeah? -And I'm marrying you.
it's me and you.
and do you wanna hear the great news there?
Yeah.
we've both already done everything we can to screw it up.
is that a smile I'm hearing? -Yeah.
it sounds to me like...
you've got a bit of writer's block on the vow front.
Yeah.
and I find, you know, as a professional writer...
that it's best to just, you know...
just stop thinking about it so much and go to bed.
and in the morning...
you'll know what to do. -Exactly.
and if not then... just write this...
I will love you.
simple, to the point...
and I swear I won't even try to take credit for it.
so you're gonna go to bed now, right?
okay. Good night.
I'll see you tomorrow. And hey...
...It's me and you.
now, there's a bride.
before we leave, we're gonna pick up our flowers, right, girls?
Miranda, you're gonna have the dahlias.
Samantha, you have the roses.
and Charlotte... -We can take care of it.
Hello?
could you put Carrie on the phone. Please?
Hello?
who let the dogs out? Get these dogs out of here!
that's all we need is the lift of a leg on the train of a dress.
could you open this door, please?
wait, wait, hold it. I'm trying to find out...
Oh, my god. -Hey.
the girls are in this car. -All of us together?
all of you together. Okay? Come on, lift it up. Let's go.
Hey. it's Carrie. Leave me a message.
see you then. Bye-bye. -Just so beautiful.
blue. -Yes, sir.
red and black.
Where's black? -Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming.
you're following the red. -I'm coming.
okay. Come on. Let's go.
ready? -Yeah, okay, you're in.
there's the bride. Look, she's dressed like a princess, do you see?
can you hold that? -Oh, yes.
thank you. Okay.
come on, scootch over.
it's like pushing a cream puff through a keyhole.
see you at the library.
Hey. It's Carrie. leave me a message.
why haven't you called me back?
look, I really need to talk to you.
call me as soon as you get this.
no more wedding guests on these stairs, understand?
bridal party only.
we've got a problem. They're not here.
they're probably stuck in traffic. -Both of them?
Hey. It's Carrie. Leave me a message.
I can't go in without you.
baby...
this whole bride-and-groom thing has really got me thrown.
I need to know that it's still us.
just you and me. Like you said.
I was putting it on. I know.
good job. Beautiful.
come on, baby. Turn around, let me see you.
you look so beautiful.
it looks beautiful.
it really does. It looks so beautiful.
Oh, look at mommy, here they come.
easy does it. We're here.
the traffic was the worst. 57th street was just...
it's okay. -Hello. You guys look great.
ready. We're ready.
he's not here.
who's not here? -The groom.
what's happening?
big's not here. -But we're 25 minutes late.
well, did anybody call him?
well, give me a phone. Somebody give me a phone.
all right, I don't know how to work this. -Here, sweetie.
thank you.
let me just look at your tie for a minute.
are you okay?
I've been calling for an hour.
why haven't you been answering?
because I don't know where my phone is.
so, what's going on? Where are you?
I was out front. I just left.
I can't do this.
Oh, my god.
Carrie? Carrie.
he's not coming. oh, my god.
what do you mean,"he's not coming"?
get me out of here.
get me out of here! -Go, go, go.
you take her, I'll take care of all of this.
all right, all right.
here we go.
what the fuck am I doing? Turn around, go back.
it's a one-way street.
by the time we go around the block, she'll be gone.
there's no one behind us. Turn around.
I think this is them. -Pull over. Pull over.
Carrie.
Carrie. I freaked out for a minute, but I'm ready now.
Oh, god.
I knew you would do this! I knew it!
Carrie, I'm sorry. -I am humiliated!
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry, Carrie.
come on. Come on.
Carrie, wait, I'm sorry. Carrie... -No! No!
come on, we're gonna get in the car.
it's all right, it's all right.
let's go, man. Move it.
I thought I would still be in extreme pain.
I feel nothing.
I'd like some more nothing.
Yes, I'm still jilted.
what the hell got into him?
he was perfectly fine at the dinner.
I knew it when he called last night.
I could tell. -Then why didn't you say anything?
I didn't wanna believe it. I di...
I didn't even wanna say it out loud.
now I have nowhere to live. -You'll stay here.
forever.
maybe you should eat something.
anyone? Hungry? -No.
Oh my clothes, I can never go back there again.
how am I gonna get my clothes?
Oh, honey, I can hire people to do all that.
anything you need.
a hit man?
I have nothing to wear but a wedding gown.
you have your honeymoon clothes here.
well, there's the silver lining.
a honeymoon at a romantic mexican resort...
that's prepaid on my credit card...
because I wanted to surprise the man who jilted me.
I can get you out of that.
worse comes to worse,
I'll say there was a death or something.
wasn't there?
keep those eyes closed. Keep them closed.
Charlotte.
come here. Come here.
I did something really bad, I think.
I said something to big at the rehearsal dinner.
what do you mean?
it was right after Steve showed up. I was upset.
big came over to me, and i said something...like...
you're crazy to get married.
it just came out.
do you think it's totally the reason? -No.
big has been weird about marriage for years.
I keep thinking I should tell Carrie. -No, no, no.
this is a bad time to even mention it.
no, no, no. Find another time later.
well, it turns out, I couldn't get her out of the honeymoon,
but I got us in.
what? -I just booked us three seats on the flight.
mexico, here we come.
I can't go to mexico. I have a job.
Jerrod. Smith Jerrod, with a J.
that's right. Great, thank you.
make sure that the car is there...
we're here,-I'll call you back later.
welcome to Mexico.
do you have Wi-Fi? Thanks.
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
I'm waiting for a Mr. and Mrs. Preston.
honey, you'll be waiting a long time. We'll talk.
this will kill her.
where is she? -In the powder room.
well, let's look around. -Yeah.
and this is a master suite.
Oh, my god.
here.
you get that side.
where are we gonna put these?
here. No more honeymoon stuff. This is very important.
here she comes.
it's going to be a gorgeous sunset.
close the shutters.
all of them.
morning.
did I dream it?
Carrie?
it's dinnertime. You slept the whole day.
so?
honey? You have to eat a little breakfast.
I'm tired.
well, eat something, then you can go back to sleep.
Oh, thank you, Paulo.
with all this gorgeous fresh food,
you're gonna eat that pudding crap the entire trip?
it's the only thing in the pantry that's totally safe.
see? "Made in poughkeepsie." I didn't wanna chance it.
it's a five-star resort.
it's Mexico.
Carrie.
is there coffee?
Yeah. yeah, of course.
the sun feels nice.
Jesus, honey, wax much?
what? I didn't know I was gonna be wearing a bathing suit.
what are you talking about? -I forgot to wax.
since when, 1998? -I've had other things on my mind.
I could be on death row and not have that situation.
well, SamanthaÔºåwhen you're married, you have a different set of priorities.
Oh, honey, don't blame marriage.
this one's married and she's not growing a national forest.
how do you even cross your legs?
let me make you a SPA appointment.
any thicker, and you won't be able to find it.
so, what, it's my fault?
I let the sex go out of my marriage.
I deserve what I got?
thanks for understanding.
honey, I'm sorry. That's not what I...
I'm fine.
Hey, let's go down to the hotel for dinner tonight.
Really?
I gotta do something to pull me out of my "Mexi-coma.
Oh, honey, you made a little joke.
good for you.
my name is Felix, I'll be your server.
Felix, we'll start with cuatro margaritas.
Oh, no, I'm not drinking. Just bottled water.
I'll drink hers. -May I have your room numbers?
we're staying in one of the private houses. uh, number 3.
very good, mrs. Preston.
that was like taking a bullet.
Charlotte has pudding in her prada.
will I ever laugh again? -Yes.
when? -When something is really, really funny.
thank god for that mariachi band or I'd be able to hear my own thoughts.
fabulous. And keep them coming.
Thanks.
thank you.
he couldn't get out of the car.
after 10 years of what he already put me through...
...he couldn't make the effort and get out of the car.
I made the effort.
I put a bird on my head.
is that what that was?
I thought it was feathers. -It was a bird.
it was beautiful. -Beautiful.
he's a bad guy.
always was.
bad guys do bad things. -And good guys do bad things.
the good guys screw you and the bad guys screw you.
the rest of them don't know how to screw you.
trust me, I've done the legwork.
after everything I know...
after 20 years of everything we've learned...
I threw it all away for the thrill of
putting his name on the honeymoon suite.
if I met me now, I wouldn't know me.
as long as we're going down this road...
...I can't believe that my life revolves around a man.
on what planet did I allow that to happen?
but you love him.
does that mean saying his name 50 times more a day than I say my own?
does it mean worrying about him and his needs before me and mine?
is it all about the other person? Is that love?
no, that's marriage. -Even this ring.
I wanted to buy this for myself.
that meant something to me, to be able to do that.
and then he buys it for me.
because he knew how much you loved it.
Yes, but now every time I look down at it,
I see him not me.
is every...? -We'll take another round.
another? -Relax. We're on vacation.
technically, we're on my honeymoon.
no, I think we're on their honeymoon.
Yeah, it's all so hot three days in.
mailbox full." yeah, I'll bet it is.
there's no time like the present. -No.
I'm not ready to face it all yet.
Hey. I'm going for a run and then to the gym for pilates.
anybody wanna...?
Hey, good news.
I got an e-mail from your buyer's attorney.
they're willing to sell you back your
old apartment at the escalated price...
and "are willing to vacate by the time you return...
...pending an additional financial offer.
well, apparently you can go home again, but it'll cost you.
let's work on getting your things there.
...you two could rule the world.
after her workout. Charlotte couldn't help but think...
how truly blessed she was.
this week had made her feel more
grateful than ever for her happy marriage.
and just for a second.
while picturing her loved ones at home in New York.
...she forgot where she was and opened her mouth.
Hello, miss.
have you had that happen? -Not recently.
sweetie, what's...?
it's locked, she's mopping.
try the...
did you just...? -Shut up, shut up, shut up!
and just like that...
Charlotte "poughkeepsied" in her pants.
Oh, my god.
Miranda was right.
when something was really. really funny. I laughed.
frist massage
received saturday. September 20th. 12: 30 p. m.
Carrie. Call me. I need to talk to you before...
there was no better time
I could think of to hire an assistant.
um, no. I do not lift boxes.
Yeah, definitely, no. I would love a career in fashion.
this is not nonfat.
I love your books. Your shit's brilliant.
Cathy?
you seem drunk. -Little bit.
never made it to bed last night.
but I type like a motherfucker!
I have a degree in finance from princeton...
and the last two years,
I've been assistant to A. V.P at merrill lynch.
that's impressive.
and, Paul, why do you think you're right for this job?
so you're from St. Louis?
that's right. Louise from St. Louis.
and you have a degree in computer science?
Yes, that's correct.
well, good for you. I can barely text.
have you ever been a personal assistant?
no, but I'm the oldest of six kids...
so I'm sure I can handle anything you got.
six kids, what's that like? -Crowded.
I had to move to new york just to get some room.
where did I end up?
in a one-bedroom apartment with three roommates.
well, aside from the space issue, why'd you move to New York?
to fall in love.
what? That's corny, right? -No.
no, no, it's... it's just very honest.
I don't think that
I've heard anybody say that in a very long time.
so Louise from St. Louis, I just have one more question.
how does an unemployed girl with three roommates...
afford the patchwork denim bowley Louis Vuitton bag?
it's rented. Bag borrow or steal?
it's like netflix for purses.
how can I not know about this?
girl, stick with me. I'll hook you up.
and did she hook me up.
Hi. This is Louise. I'm calling for Carrie Bradshaw.
Yes, she received your invitation but she will be unable to attend.
thank you.
put that over there.
after only three days...
I began to think of her as Saint Louise from St. Louis.
ain't nothing in there for you.
and as I moved back into my old apartment...
Miranda searched for a new one. Downtown.
you see the chinese writing? -Yeah
new york magazine says this is the new up-and-coming neighborhood.
okay, maybe down that way? -Maybe you come home.
look, white guy with a baby.
wherever he's going, that's where we need to be.
come on.
I lived here before. It used to be all-Ukrainian area.
a u-haul.
coming or going?
going. oh, boy. I'm gonna check it out. -Okay.
wait down here, okay?
and there in old ukrainia. Miranda found her new apartment.
and there they remained for the rest of their days...
for the birds were constantly on guard...and the women could not so much as step one foot out the door.
and cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after.
you know that this is just a fairy tale, right, sweetheart?
I mean, things don't always happen like this in real life.
I just think you should know that now. -Again.
and another one bites the dust.
mommy's home.
thanks for watching Lily while I went to the doctor.
Oh, sure. -everything okay?
I'm pregnant. -How?
you know how people always say that when you stop trying,
it can happen?
and my doctor says that she knows other couples who have adopted...
and then they get pregnant.
sweetie. -Carrie, I'm pregnant.
I guess in certain houses. fairy tales do come true.
Oh, that was really hot.
you seem kind of distant. -Distant? You're still in me.
do you wanna talk about it?
when have I ever wanted to talk about it?
okay. I'll talk about it.
your best friends got screwed over by their guys.
how could you not be distant?
it's more than that.
lately, I haven't been feeling a connection to...
what, me? -No.
all I do is work...
and you run off to new york every chance you get.
well, not every chance I get. Only for the a-list things.
and my managing you, it's... It's getting to be too much.
I'm starting to resent it.
for the last two years, it's been all about you.
well, for the first three years, it was all about you.
I know. That was so much more fun.
Carrie Bradshaw's web page is a mess.
interesting. So is Carrie Bradshaw.
Hey, when are we gonna get to the really important stuff,
like unpacking my closet?
one thing at a time. You ever gonna answer any of these e-mails?
Yes. - when?
now? - okay.
well, i'll read and you tell me what to do. - okay.
who's john@jjpny. Com?
Oh, shit. That's him, right?
delete.
and isn't there some cyberspace place that you can send those...
so that I never have to see an e-mail from him ever again?
do that, please.
you sure you wanna end all communication with him?
okay. Great.
I can't believe you're even dressing up.
all the parents in brady's school dress up. It's fun.
fun thought up by a group of non-working mothers with nothing else to do all day.
all right, what do they got? Witch and sexy kitten.
that's it. The only two choices for women, witch and sexy kitten.
you just said a mouthful there, sister.
maybe I should wear this and a briefcase, and go as myself.
I got an e-mail from big.
I don't know what to say.
uh, then don't send an e-mail. - what were you expecting?
and in the subject box, 2 words
I'm sorry.
steve is all about the i'm sorry.
"I'm sorry" e-mails, "i'm sorry" voice mails...
"I'm sorry" flowers, "i'm sorry" cards.
how about, don't do anything to be "i'm sorry" for?
well, maybe he's sorry.
well, maybe so is big.
point taken.
Hey, you're scaring the women.
it's gonna take a little more than that
to scare me after what i've been through.
I still cannot believe this happened to me. I mean, l...
I know it happened.
but I just... I can't believe it happened.
I lay awake at night going over every detail of that last week in my head.
Carrie,
there's a detail about that last week i've been meaning to tell you.
at the rehearsal dinner... - and then I saw it.
the only thing scary enough to scare me after what I'd been through.
you look great. You look amazing. So that's the worst of it.
wait, wait, wait.
what does it say there in the editor's note?
the wedding of Carrie Bradshaw and john james preston was canceled...
...as this issue went to press. Bradshaw is...
Bradshaw is what?
wait...
Bradshaw is still single and living in new york city.
I didn't wanna buy it...
but I figured it was one less vogue in new york.
Louise.
Oh, my lord. I didn't even recognize you.
that's the point. My head's in the witness protection program.
I'm feeling that look on you though.
and I am feeling that chanel on you. - mine till tuesday.
all right, so... - here. Time to rejoin the world.
already?
your new number, area code 347-85... - ho... Ho... Hold it.
Oh, no. No, I'm a 917 gal, always have been.
I tried. It's no longer available.
now you're 347.
Samantha jones.
Carrie Bradshaw. Or I used to be.
talk to me.
I'm a 347 area code. How awful is that?
347 is the new new york.
well, I want the old new york with my old 917 and my old will to live.
old new york, new new york. Honey, at least it's new york.
another hard thing about being in L. A:
my sex-on-a-stick next-door neighbor.
I can't stop looking at him. - looking?
just looking.
after seeing steve's face at the rehearsal dinner, I could never...
Oh, but you should see this guy. Every night...
sex with a different partner. He's like...
me five years ago. - yeah. When I was a 917.
I mean. What's the point of having a hot guy next door if you can't have sex with him?
we agreed that no one else from the show but smith was going to be on the cover.
well, get back to me.
and in an effort to stay out of the house and out of trouble...
Samantha went shopping.
rescue a puppy today?
she needs a good home. Interested? - no.
and just as samantha convinced herself that the dog wasn't for her...
she's been fixed, but she hasn't lost the urge.
and because samantha couldn't get off...
she got things.
what would happen if these were to magically disappear?
Yeah, I know where you live. - for a pair like this, I could move.
wait, Carrie, not that one.
do you want me to get rid of it?
no.
no, it's too beautiful.
I'll just...
bury it deep in the back...
like I did my feelings.
do you miss him? - every day.
it's weird...
I haven't cried very much at all.
I don't know, maybe...
maybe you're only allotted a certain amount of tears per man...
and I used mine up.
Yeah, I know how you feel.
because my st. Louis boyfriend broke up with me last year...
and I miss him all the time.
suddenly. It dawned on me. There were two broken hearts in my walk-in.
Louise, we need a cocktail. Grab your rental.
and it threw me so hard.
because, you know, I thought will...
that's his name.
I thought he was the love of my life. - well, what happened?
he said he loved me and all, but he didn't think that I was the one.
that shit hurt. But, you know, whatever.
I'm not gonna give up on love. - good.
love is the thing, you know.
you see that?
that's love. And I'm bringing it to me all day long.
excuse me.
Oh, I remember that smile. Who's the guy?
someone I just met. He wants me to meet him for drinks.
at 11: 30? Oh, that's a booty call.
no, it's not. He's a waiter, he just got off work.
Louise. Now, I may not get texts, I may not send texts, but trust me.
the subtext of that text? Booty.
but if he meets me, then it's not a booty call, right?
all right, then. Enjoy yourself.
that's what your 20s are for.
your 30s are to learn the lessons.
your 40s are to pay for the drinks.
well, in that case, i'll take another one.
it's all about the desk.
if I find the desk, the writing will come. And it better come...
because I'm using my new book advance to pay the fancy decorator.
I think it is so great that you're redoing your entire apartment.
Yeah, well, out with the old and...
Oh, in with the overpriced.
Hey. Harry called me and mentioned that you're not running.
why'd he do that? - because he loves you and he's concerned.
there's nothing to be concerned about.
well, did...? Did the doctor say that it's not safe or something?
no. She said because I'm already a runner, it's fine.
so then, why are you not...
because I'm afraid something bad is gonna happen.
it's a miracle I'm even pregnant. - okay.
I have everything I ever wanted.
I am so happy that I'm terrified.
nobody gets everything that they want. Look at you. Look at miranda.
you're good people and look at what happened to you.
of course something bad is gonna happen to me.
sweetie...
you shit your pants this year.
maybe you're done.
you run every day, that's what you do.
you can't stop being who you are because you're afraid, right?
all right.
okay. Here we go.
okay.
and as the last of the autumn leaves fell away...
...so did charlotte's fear.
by the time the first snow fell. Charlotte got her stride back.
are you sure you don't want me to respond.
to any of these holiday parties?
no, I am perfectly happy spending time alone.
you sure? Because this looks like a good one.
go home. Seriously, you're gonna miss your plane, go.
okay. But first...
merry christmas.
you didn't have to. - it's just something silly.
Oh, louise from st. Louis. - you said you never saw it.
well, jeez.
now I feel bad.
if I had known we were exchanging gifts...
I would have bought you one two weeks ago...
and hidden it here.
that is not what I think it is. - I don't know, open it.
Oh, my god.
my very own louis vuitton?
that's right. No more rental for you.
look who's home from the big city.
it was the best money I'd ever spent.
new year's eve and a cup of noodles.
so you remember what you're gonna say at midnight?
happy new year. - yeah.
except you're gonna say it much more excited than that.
you're gonna say, "happy new year!" - happy new year.
Yeah. And you say that and then you kiss.
all right.
all ready to go, b-boy?
did you remember to pack the batman that santa brought you?
I think it's in the kitchen.
Oh, you gotta have the new batman, huh?
you got plans with the girls?
we're all kind of staying in tonight.
would you like to come out and eat with us?
we could go someplace on your side of the bridge.
no. Thank you.
Miranda, I never meant to hurt you.
Batman. - oh, there he is. Batman.
put your hat on. - yeah.
it's snowing out. - here you go.
I'm gonna bring batman. Okay.
happy new year.
happy new year.
kiss.
all right, i'll see you tomorrow.
this is my new...
you know what we're gonna do?
we're gonna light a firecracker at midnight.
Hello? So I thought...
that one of the perks of having a family...
was that you didn't have to spend new year's eve alone with chinese food.
I am alone with chinese food.
I was asleep. - oh, shit. I'm sorry.
no, no, that's okay. Where's brady?
it's steve's night. - oh. Right.
don't wake up. Go... Go back to sleep. - no, it's okay.
you all right? - I'm fine.
I got all choked up...
watching stupid new year's eve stuff alone on tv.
you want me to come over? - I'm all the way downtown.
no, I can... You know, I can... I grab a cab.
on new year's? No way. I'm... I'm... I'm fine.
really. I just... I just wanted to talk a little.
go back to sleep. I'll... I'll see you next year.
good night. - good night.
should auld acquaintance be forgot, And never brought to mind?

a young child that perhaps they've...
Hey, easy there, girl. - you all right?
Yeah. Thanks.
three months driving in l. A. And I forgot how to use my fucking legs.
every spring. The women of new york...
leave the foolish choices of their
past behind and look forward to the future.
this is known as fashion week.
Oh, there we are.
we're in the front row? - I had to pull some strings.
very nice. - I should go thank them.
decide where we're gonna go for lunch and i'll make a call.
it's just like old times.
so this is what you all spent your saturdays doing while I was with brady and steve at the brooklyn aquarium?
well...
not every saturday.
just so you know, we always had front row at the mammal show.
steve does the funniest dolphin impression.
actually, it's more steve as a dolphin.
you really can't forgive him?
are you suggesting something?
I like steve. I always liked steve.
he's apologized 100 times. He's not seeing anyone else.
what's it gonna take?
are you also suggesting that she forgive big?
no. I could kill big.
sometimes when I'm running...
I imagine what I would say to him if I ever saw him again.
I have the perfect opening line.
do you wanna hear it?
uh, yeah.
I curse the day you were born.
that's impressive. You better work up a hand gesture to go with it.
I didn't know if it was the fashion...
or the fact that the four of us were together again...
but for the first time in a long time...
I felt like myself.
well, let's get a cab, okay? I'm absolutely starving. I don't know what...
fur is murder!
murder! Murder!
murder! Murder! - god, I miss new york.
and a couple of weeks later. I met saint louise's st. Louis boyfriend. Will.
over christmas. They realized how much they loved each other.
I'm Carrie. - will.
just in time for valentine's day.
just in time. Wish you a happy valenines day.
to aunt Carrie-love lily
I'm calling to make sure that you aren't hanging from your shower rod.
you called about an hour too early. - so, what's the v-day plan?
well, miranda and I are going to dinner...
and then a very violent slasher movie.
perfect. - you?
I'm making smith sushi. Pause for reaction.
wow, you do that?
we took a class a while back.
and when he comes in that door at 7: 30...
l'm going to surprise him by laying naked on the dining-room table...
covered with homemade sushi.
boy, you do have time on your hands.
so. What else is new?
there is a whole lot of love in this room.
is it me or is valentine's day this year on steroids?
no. I think it was like this last year. We just played for the other team.
good evening. This is our valentine's night menu.
all of our specials are romantically
themed and designed to be split for two.
are we having wine? - yes.
glass or a...? - bottle.
I'll be right back to take you and your girlfriend's order.
why would you have looked at the vogue today of all days?
because I'm an emotional cutter.
I deserve what I got. Running all over new york...
...believing that I'm finally getting my happy ending.
see? Love does conquer all.
look at me in my one-of-a-kind wedding gown...
...marrying the love of my life. - would you like another bot...?
Yes. - yes.
and miranda, in that article, I did not say "we" once.
no. The whole article was "i think" and "i want.
it was from your point of view. - yeah, exactly. My point of view.
exactly. The whole wedding was my point of view.
I let... I let the wedding get bigger than big.
I am the reason that he did not get out of the car.
okay.
I said something to big that I shouldn't have...
...at the rehearsal dinner.
what do you mean?
after steve showed up, I was really upset.
and I bumped into big...
and I said that you two were crazy to get married.
here we go, your shiraz.
okay, great. Thanks so much.
I'm sorry. I was upset. Steve had...
I have been going over this and over this in my mind for five months.
and for five months, you kept a secret like that?
I tried to tell you once, but then... - once?
you tried to tell me once?
you should have tried to tell me every single day.
I know. I was waiting for the right time.
there is no right time to tell me that you ruined my marriage.
it just happened. I wasn't thinking.
Carrie, please don't go. - you know what I think hurts the most?
is that you kept a secret from me.
and I have never, ever kept a secret from you.
ever.
no, I'm lying. For the last five months...
...l've been thinking that it is a huge mistake that you left steve.
there.
how does it feel?
excuse me. Excuse me.
any minute now.
Hey. Babe. It's me. Pick up.
pick up.
all right. It's 7: 20. I'm still at the studio.
we're behind. I'm gonna be a little bit late. Sorry. Bye.
forty minutes later...
sushi. Samantha. Still no smith.
this is bullshit.
it was the same valentine night samantha had planned...
minus the sushi.
and the other woman.
I'm home.
man, that was a long day. - you're three hours late.
bummer, I know. Did you eat?
Yes, I ate.
I ate the sushi that I hand-made for you.
the sushi that I laid all over my
naked body as a valentine surprise for you.
why are you so upset? I called.
I couldn't pick up the phone.
my body was covered everywhere with sushi.
I got wasabi in places where one should never get wasabi.
Oh, you think it's funny that I slaved all day in this kitchen to make a lovely meal for you?
you made some sushi. It's not a big deal.
not a big deal. here.
I am not the type of woman...
...who sits home all day waiting for a man!
enjoy your california handmade roll!
happy fucking valentine's day.
it's Carrie. Leave me a message.
Carrie. It's me. Please pick up.
three days of "i'm sorry" calls and e-mails and flowers...
...and I still wasn't ready.
it was the longest we'd ever gone without speaking.
Carrie.
I need to talk to you. - how long have you been waiting here?
Seventeen-dollars long.
please get in. It just hit 18.
this is weird, not talking. - I'm upset.
Carrie, I understand but it just happened
I never meant to hurt you.
you have to forgive me.
you know...
what? - no.
no, please, what were you gonna say?
you badger me to forgive you in three days.
you won't even consider forgiving
steve for something he did six months ago.
it's not the same thing.
it's forgiveness.
I don't know that I can trust that it won't happen again.
Steve, you're very quiet today.
Miranda, I know I made it hard for you to trust me...
but you made it hard for me to trust you. - me?
the way you treated me and cut me out of your life like that.
I mean, yeah, I broke a vow...
...but what about the other vows?
like promising to love someone for better or for worse.
what about that?
how do I know she's not gonna punish me for the rest of my life?
you don't.
and she doesn't know for sure that you won't have another indiscretion.
all you can know is that you wanna move forward...
and risk that the love you have for each other won't allow that to happen.
and that's what we'll discover here.
so we're done with our last session.
we're not allowed to talk to each other for two weeks...
while we figure out if being together
again is something that we really want.
and then we had to pick a place to meet...
...and if we both show up on that day, the past no longer exists.
it's like showing up is our promise to each other...
...that we're both willing to let it all go and move forward.
can you do that? - I don't know.
I don't know. I have a lot of thinking to do.
thinking? Or feeling? - what do you mean?
well, miranda, you're a lawyer.
you know, you can argue both sides of any case.
but why we feel what we feel isn't logical. It's emotional.
so I'm sorry, harvard, but I'm afraid...
...you're gonna have to base this decision on your emotions.
well, then I'm screwed. I don't know what I feel.
you will. There will come a moment when you know.
and if it's "yes," then all that brilliant logic...
...It's gonna go right out the window with the past.
and I thought picking a spot to meet was gonna be the challenge.
where is it? - on the brooklyn bridge.
halfway between our two places. - very logical, and yet poetic.
poetic if we both show up.
otherwise you're on a bridge, rejected.
it's not a good plan.
I got two pieces of good news.
Oh, and i've got two coffees. - thank you.
here you go. So, what's up?
I just heard from your realtor and the apartment on 5th has finally sold.
you got 60 days before the new owner takes possession,
and you're out of there.
and what is the other news?
I'm moving back to st. Louis and we're getting married in the fall.
Oh, my god.
wait a minute, I gotta see that.
well, it's gorgeous. - and you know what? It ain't rented.
on the day of her decision deadline...
...true to form. Miranda had argued both sides of the case.
thank you.
it suddenly dawned on miranda...
...that steve's list might have had more cons than pros.
and miranda never looked back.
well. Almost never.
kiss me.
meanwhile. Back in lost angeles...
turns out new age philosophy wasn't the secret.
Samantha had money. A career. And a man who loved her.
but still.
she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing from her life.
baby, come back.
that's not our house.
where are you going?
Oh, i'm... I'm sorry.
I'm your next-door neighbor...
...and my dog ran up on your dick... Deck.
suddenly it wasn't so secret what she was missing.
wanna join me?
Hey. I'm dante.
stop by anytime.
it was official.
from the minute she met dante...
...samantha was in hell.
and by spring. I looked like my old self...
...in my new apartment. Just in time for the baby shower.
Oh, excuse me, honey. Hi. - sure.
a woman put a glass on your new desk without a coaster.
I said, if you do it again, I'm gonna break your arm.
Thanks. - bathroom?
Yes. Hey, how's it going? - pretty good, I think.
good, good, good.
Where's samantha? Her plane landed two hours ago.
Oh, you know her. She's probably working out first.
there's no place like home.
sweetie.
you have a rat in your purse.
that rat better be housebroken. - take your coat?
sure. - hey, cute bag.
Oh, my gosh, samantha.
you have a dog.
did you ever think you'd see the day me with a pooch?
mother of god, what's with the gut?
well, she's eating something out there.
come on in!
we've been waiting for you.
I eat so I won't cheat.
what exactly are you eating?
everything except dante's dick.
language, please. This is a grown-up apartment now.
I guess I didn't realize how big I was until I saw it on your faces.
How...? And I say this with love.
how could you not realize it?
I've been avoiding mirrors. - well, I'm proud of you for not cheating.
I don't think there's anything to be proud of.
I stuff my face to stop myself from
doing something that feels natural to me.
now, listen, this isn't about the weight.
you would look gorgeous at any size.
but are you happy? - well...
...relationships aren't always about being happy, right?
I mean, how often do you feel happy in your relationship?
I'm pretty sure that's to you.
every day. - you feel happy every day?
not all day every day, but every day.
when was the last time you felt happy?
six months ago.
I think that's normal for L . A.
what am I gonna do? - what's your gut tell you?
I know, but smith stayed with me through chemo.
and if he can stay with me through that...
...then I should be able to stay in this relationship for him.
sweetie, you just compared your relationship to chemo.
there we were. The three mirrors samantha couldn't avoid.
and samantha?
that pillow cost $300.
my little monster. Hi.
Hey. You're home.
I thought you were staying the week. - we need to talk.
Oh, man.
I knew this was coming. - yeah.
this isn't working.
I've done my best. I've given it five years and 15 pounds.
well, what?
you don't love me anymore? - yes, I love you.
it's just...
I'm just gonna say the thing you're not supposed to say.
I love you but I love me more.
and i've been in a relationship with myself for 49 years...
...and that's the one I need to work on.
you're gonna find a wonderful woman who loves being in a relationship.
what will you find?
I don't know.
but that's a risk I'm willing to take.
Hey, no. Keep it. - okay.
every time I look down at it...
...l'm gonna think of you.
some love stories aren't epic novels. Some are short stories.
but that doesn't make them any less filled with love.
at this time...
...we ask that all passengers fasten their seat belts...
in preparation for landing.
we're landing in new york.
I'm gonna need to take that now.
okay. Here we go now. Give me that.
as someone returned to my life...
...someone left.
stamps, mailing labels. - okay.
and I put all your unopened mail from your P. O. Box in these envelopes.
all right.
and please, please...
...do not make a mess out of CarrieBradshaw. Com.
okay. - it's my masterpiece.
what am I gonna do without you? - you'll find some other girl...
...but she won't have my style.
saint louise.
you brought me back to life.
and you gave me louise vuitton.
serious. We need to stop crying.
your keys. - oh, thanks.
wait, wait, wait. Don't forget your love.
no. I found my love.
I'm leaving that with you.
see you at my wedding. - i'll meet you in st. Louis.
Bye.
and a couple of weeks later...
...a slow-moving charlotte grabbed a quick lunch.
well, when are you due? - next week.
you look gorgeous. - oh, thank you.
Hi. Can I get you something to drink? - no, no.
no? - no. I can't stay.
help me. Help me move the table.
Charlotte.
Charlotte, wait. Wait.
Charlotte. Charlotte, don't run, you're pregnant.
I don't wanna see you. I'm so mad at you.
I was always on your side. And then you go and you do that to Carrie.
No! No! I'm not gonna cry. I'm not gonna waste tears on you.
I curse the day you were born.
I think my water just broke. Oh, my god.
Taxi! - my car's right there.
I don't wanna get in your car! Taxi!
please, I gotta get you to the hospital, okay? Please?
okay? Lenox hill.
okay. Start the car.
Hi. Congratulations. A girl.
it's my lot in life to be surrounded by beautiful women.
come here.
she's gorgeous. - say hello to rose - rose. What a beautiful name. - it's after harry's bubbe.
now we got a lily and a rose.
well...
...I have to say, you two are very cool customers...
...making the "baby's here" call without all the "i'm in labor" drama.
there was plenty of drama.
my water broke while I was standing in front of a restaurant.
wow, that's very dramatic. - wait, wait, she's not done.
it broke while I was talking to big. - what?
see? Drama.
I ran into him and I got so upset, my water broke.
he brought her to the hospital, stayed until the baby was born.
I think he was hoping to see you.
well, today is not about him. It's about beautiful baby rose.
so we know she has charlotte's hair. What else do we know?
she's a doll. Mazel tov. - thank you.
Bye.
he asked me to ask you to call him.
I know, it's none of my business, but I felt bad for the schmuck...
...hanging around the hospital hoping to see you.
I swear every time he heard someone in heels walking down the hall,
his heart stopped.
Harry, it's... It's so much more complicated than you can imagine.
I know it is, and you have every right to never call him, but I just...
I'm a big pile of love today and I feel bad for the guy.
he said he's been writing you, but you never responded.
no, he's never written to me.
he said he wrote because he didn't have your phone number.
no, he's never written. Ever.
then why would he say he had?
two hours. Two manila envelopes and countless e-mails later...
...I was just about to give up on the big riddle when...
I had told louise to put big in a place
where I would never have to hear from him again.
this is louise. Leave a message.
hey... Hey, louise, it's me.
can you give me the password for your assistant file?
okay, call me. Thanks.
Oh, shit.
as soon as I typed in "love." there he was.
and because big still didn't have the words...
...he retyped a love letter from beethoven.
and lord byron.
and john keats.
and voltaire.
there they were. The love letters of great men. Volume one.
plus one more written by john james preston.
I know i screwed it up but i will love you forever.
I wanted to call him. But our love...
...Carrie and big. Volumes one. Two and three...
...stopped me.
I didn't hear my phone. We're shopping for my wedding gown.
that dress makes your boobies look big.
mama, can you please? This is a work call. - shut up.
no, it's okay, I figured it out. - well, I was gonna call you anyway.
today is the final day on the 5th avenue apartment.
you have till 6: 00 before they change the locks.
no, I don't need to go over there.
do you not want those never-worn shoes?
Oh, god, I completely forgot.
if you don't, you can send them to me and i'll squeeze my feet into them.
but it's already 5: 00.
Hello? They are never-been-worn, $400 shoes.
actually 525. Yeah, okay. All right, thanks. Bye.
Taxi!
the light in our prewar apartment...
looked completely different postwar.
I was gonna get these to you. I didn't want it to be a total loss.
it wasn't logic. It was love.
why did we ever decide to get married?
I guess we were afraid it would mean something if we didn't.
I'm sorry to have done that to you.
I'm sorry to have done that to you.
you know the funny part?
is there a funny part?
we were perfectly happy before we decided to live happily ever after.
guess the joke's on us.
it's a good closet. - thanks.
it's comfortable.
is this what you had in mind when you installed the carpet?
I'd like to think I was that smooth.
we better get up before the new owners bust in on us.
and the way we decided to get married...
...it was all business.
no romance.
that's not the way you propose to someone.
this is.
Carrie Bradshaw...
love of my life...
will you marry me?
see, this is why there's a diamond.
you need to do something to close the deal.
and forsaking all others...
and in the end. Carrie Bradshaw married john james preston...
in a label-less dress. - I do.
then by the power vested in me by the state of new york...
...I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.
ever thine. Ever mine.
ever ours.
so you're okay that it was just us?
it was perfect. You and me, like I said.
still, it would have been nice if you had the girls here.
which is why I called them.
Hi, Carrie! - mazel tov!
ham and eggs. Ham and eggs for you, sir. - yup, that's me.
it wasn't a fancy. Designer reception either.
just food and friends.
butter, ma'am?
how's the marriage going?
and as I put the wedding gown away, why is it that we're willing to write our own vows...
but not our own rules and that's just a little something I'm working on.
thank you.
Oh, my god.
maybe some labels are best left in the closet.
maybe when we label people "bride." "groom." "husband." "wife." "married." "single..."
we forget to look past the label to the person.
this is delicious. - why did we ever stop drinking these?
because everyone else started. - well, that one's an oldie but goodie.
and speaking of an oldie but goodie...
happy birthday. - happy birthday.
wait, wait, wait. A toast.
to samantha.
fifty and fabulous.
to us...
...and the next 50.
to the next 50.
and there. In the same city where they met as girls...
...four new york women entered the next phase of their lives...
...dressed head to toe in love.
and that's the one label...
...that never goes out of style.
really ?
are you ?
I brought the thing.
then, yeah.
thank you.
... In a dark blue honda accord
last seen heading south on the 101.
according to officials, the abduction took place ?
this morning around 6: 50 at a school bus stop
where eyewitnesses say that a tall caucasian man in a hooded sweatshirt
forced six-Year-Old colleen platt into the car.
Hi, could you go get Keith and tell him that I need him ?
he and Durrell went to go get some doughnuts.
they'll be right back.
whose idea was that to get doughnuts ?
are you sick ?
no, I'm just waking up.
my face came off last night.
what ?
what did you just say ?
my face keeps coming off when I go to bed.
wake me up !
... body of young Sarah Davis
was recovered last night in Fontana.
authorities had been searching in that case
for what eyewitnesses had claimed was a dark-Blue nissan maxima.
but now they are saying the two incidents are related.
weather forecast...
I'm gonna take the boys to school.
Oh, okay. Thanks for...
letting me sleep.
Hey, have you heard about the,
they think this guy's on the loose or something ?
or did I just dream that ?
no, I just saw it on the news downstairs.
walk the boys into school ? - Sure.
are you all right ?
I just had a hard time waking up.
I'm all right. It was just a bad dream like people have.
are you sure ? - Yeah.
look, it's been almost six weeks since...
you know.
it's time, right, for me to get it together ?
it's time when you feel that it's time.
I'll call you when I drop the boys off.
all right, thanks.
thanks for breakfast. - Anytime.
what's this ? - It's Maya's medical history.
Oh. Where did you find it ?
it slipped between the files in the second file box.
it was on the bottom underneath.
and I got the directions to the pediatrician's new office.
they're in there on the top. - You're amazing.
you want me to come with ? to the doctors ?
God, I don't know.
no, you know, I think it'll be better If the hand-Off is
just Ruth and me and Maya.
Thanks, though.
it'll be good to have her back in the house.
yeah yeah, it will.
can I ?
sure.
foot.
somebody wants out.
two more months.
I'm not drunk.
it seems like you are.
I'm not.
Claire, you fell asleep at your desk this morning
twice. And I can smell it.
you can't smell vodka. - I can.
anyway, you're being a little fucking bitch.
all right, Claire, we're all really sorry - That your brother died. - Really ?
Yeah, really.
but you've been drunk or high at work
like every day this week and it's starting to scare people.
I mean, I've told them all to give you a break, but
well, this doesn't feel like much of a fuckin' break, Kirsten.
being followed into the bathroom and
lectured at by some schoolteacher.
just go home for the day and sleep it off, okay ?
I won't tell.
you won't tell ? - No.
who won't you tell ? - Human resources.
there's no one to fuckin' tell - I'll tell human resources !
God damn it ! go ! tell, tell, tell !
okay, okay ! I am wicked pissed !
you are gonna be so fired !
Yeah, well, I'm fucking Ted.
no way. - Way.
Marianne and Johnny... - Didn't want to hurt your feelings.
sorry.
God. Way.
just... belongings.
and I need you to file that for me. - Okay.
I think that I have everything. - Yeah, you have everything.
come on. - Good.
you're all doing really important work here
and I'm sorry if I fucked it up for anybody.
why don't you just shut up for a few seconds, okay ?
where are we going home ? - No, I don't wanna go home.
Oh, we're going home.
everyone you know is gonna die. - Claire come on, .
let's go.
and that little Kirsten is a fucking bitch !
can you make him look whole again
for when the people come ?
I already have a call in to the company
that provides us with prosthetic limbs
designed expressly for this purpose.
we want him to look like, you know,
who he was as a person.
not like
people should see more than just what happened to him.
he'll look very natural.
I promise. And complete.
thank you.
can you stand him up and make him walk around too ?
Oh, Holly, please don't start that again.
can make him maybe like talk and tell everybody
it's all good and it's really no problem to be dead ?
maybe just stick your hand up inside his head and, you know, "Everything's fine ! everything's fine !"
freedom, freedom, freedom !
if you dress Paul up in that uniform - Holly, stop it ! - No, mom.
and put fake arms and legs on him and make it looked like it all worked out - What's so wrong with that ? - It's not real !
I don't care what's real ! I don't wanna see him like that !
are we gonna tell the people who come to the funeral he killed himself too.
are we ? - No.
with a drug that people use to put dogs to sleep ?
is that how you want your brother to be remembered ?
I said no.
he gave himself a hypodermic of pentobarbital.
we don't know how he got a hold of it.
I think maybe a night nurse.
they're so understaffed over there right now
they're taking anybody.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why you always Have to rub people's faces in it.
it is such a violent impulse.
should we have tubes put in her ears ?
no.
it's a whole surgical procedure
under general anesthetic to put those tubes in.
she gets these ear infections so often lately.
it doesn't seem right.
well, we can ask the doctor if he'd put on
a prophylactic dose of antibiotics for a few months.
see if that would help. - They do that ?
Oh, more and more.
because, you know, those tubes fall out when kids play.
how do you know all this ?
I...
I joined an online pediatric news group
a couple of weeks ago just to keep up, you know ?
whatever.
we'll, we'll ask the doctor.
thank you for coming with us this morning.
my pleasure.
and for being a friend lately.
I'm glad I can help.
I don't want to let her go, George. I don't.
I know.
thank you, mr. Diaz. - Of course.
we'll see you tomorrow a little before 2: 00.
Hey, I'm sorry I blew up in there.
I feel like I'm going kind of crazy lately.
I know how you feel.
I miss him so much.
he was the only brother I'll ever have, you know ?
I'll never have another brother.
Yeah. Believe me, it wasn't a problem.
thank you.
what ?
Hey, I know this must be a hard time for you.
it's hard for me too.
I'm sure it is. - But even so
so at some point we're gonna have to.
sit down and talk about the future
of the business.
I agree.
does it have to be today ? - No
obviously not.
all right, then.
then I do feel like I need to know when it's gonna happen.
it's been more than a month since Nate died
and we still haven't even talked at all
look, Rico, I don't...
know when I'm going to be able to.
I'm sorry. - It's just, you know,
I got , I got a family I'm trying to think about.
so do I.
I have a fucking husband, Rico. I have two children.
when are you gonna realize I'm human being just like you, when ?
when ?
support our troops ?
what a bunch of bullshit !
miss, I don't know what you want me to do.
why don't you try driving something That doesn't require so much
gas for starters. If you're so fucking concerned ?
let's go inside. Sorry.
Yeah, we wouldn't want to offend anybody - While they're supporting our troops ! - Claire, shut up !
dozens of fucking iraqis are still dying every day !
the whole world hates us for going in there in the first place.
and terrorists are still gonna be blowing shit up
in this country for the next 100 years.
and the best thing she can think to do about it is put...
take her inside ! - A sticker on that enormous shit box !
wait. I am, I am so, so sorry.
they still bring the wounded soldiers back at night
so the press can't even film it and nobody sees !
american soldiers are still being fucked up everyday
and they don't even tell us !
and it's all so you can put gas in this enormous fucking car
to keep everybody feeling really fucking american !
Claire, shut the hell up ! her brother just died !
damn it !
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry, Mrs. Duncan. - You should be.
she will not be here tomorrow. - I should hope not !
she seems like she's on drugs. - She usually is.
Bye-bye. Thank you.
what ?
so when can we talk about it ? - Are you fucking serious ?
Yeah. I'm sorry, but I am.
I need to know when you think you'll be ready - To have this conversation. - Okay, here.
here are my keys. - Oh, David.
no, you want the whole fucking business, Rico ? it's yours.
I just want to hear what your plans are.
no, it's yours ! it's all yours !
there we had our talk.
no one's returned a call to my phone in weeks.
I called Brenda twice,
Maggie several times.
I guess no one returns calls anymore.
I've never waited this long for a doctor my entire life.
it's like this in my neurologist's office.
they overbook.
it's so rude.
Oh, God, sorry I'm late. - Mommy !
Hey, my sunflower !
how are you ?
you got a sore ear ? let me look.
the doctor hasn't been in yet ? - No.
but they told us it'll be very soon.
it's been an extremely long wait.
Yeah, we're kinda getting used to that now.
did you bring her things, her clothes ?
they're all in the car. - Great.
Brenda. - What ?
I think Maya should stay with us.
Oh, really ? - Yes, I do because - Maybe this isn't the time. - Well, she's not going to.
you don't know what it's like with a new-born.
no, but I think I'll figure it out.
she'll probably end up staying with us when the baby comes anyway.
no, she won't. I have Billy staying with me - So we will be fine. - Billy ?
I'm not sure that's the best environment.
I'm not sure I care what you think, Ruth.
I'll go wait in the car. - Oh, look. Come on, stay.
no.
I'm sorry, can we please just not make this
any harder than it has to be for Maya's sake ?
there are too many people in this room already.
I'm gonna go. Yes.
you are about to have a brand-new baby.
how is this any of your business, George ?
any ?
she's all Ruth has right now.
she's all Ruth has.
whereas you've got your anger, your self-pity and your spite.
are you really gonna make Maya pay for the rest of her life
because I fucked somebody else and died ?
she's better off with my mom, Brenda, and you know it.
Dr. Westin will be with you in just a few minutes.
sorry for the wait. - Wait ?
what's that ?
okay, keep her.
drink.
there.
give me my keys.
where do you wanna go ? - Ted
give me my fucking keys !
I'm not gonna let you drive messed up like this so just.
what ?
what's so funny ?
nothing. I just never thought I'd know a guy named Ted.
it's such a '70s name. - Funny.
now give me my keys.
no. - Oh, God.
fuck ! okay.
I don't want you here.
I don't even like you.
you are a fascist republican asshole.
and the fact that I ever even liked you in the first place
is total proof that I am totally fucked up about my life !
so will you please just go
and leave me alone ?
you look really stupid right now.
go, you fucking freak ! get out !
I'll bring back your keys tomorrow.
you know what your big mistake was ?
you should have married Billy.
that's not even funny. - Come on, brenda, he's your soul mate.
all I ever was, all anybody's ever been, is a substitute for Billy.
that would be so easy for you to believe that, wouldn't it ?
it's not your fault. You were raised to be impaired.
you were grown wrong like one of those square watermelons
they cultivate in Japan.
don't laugh and miss the sorrow of it.
I love Billy as my brother. That is natural
and it's right.
just because you're incapable of having any real feelings about any human being unless you're fucking them.
Brenda, listen to me. Pack up your stuff, take Billy and go.
you can be together. Go someplace far away like, you know,
Nova Scotia. Tell people you're married
they'll never know. You'll live together, you can love each other, you can fuck.
I am so glad you're dead.
Brenda, I am pretty sure that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver
are brother and sister and they're making it work.
just shut the fuck up.
I'm just saying you only get one life.
there's no God, no rules, no judgments
except for those you accept or create for yourself.
and once it's over, it's over.
dreamless sleep forever and ever.
so why not be happy while you're here ?
really.
why not ?
so then he came back inside, threw the keys at me and left.
so does that mean he quit ?
no, nobody's quitting. - Why'd you give him the keys ?
we were fighting. I was...
it happens sometimes when people work together.
eat some salad. - I had some.
you did not. - I had a cucumber.
Rico does... - What ?
he does kind of have a right to ask for a sit-down, doesn't he ?
he - Yeah, Keith, he has a right. - He is your partner.
I know he is. And I'm not denying him any right.
he just wants to have a conversation. - I know.
I just need some time to sort things out before we talk about it.
could you take my side on this, please ?
I 'm taking your side - It doesn't feel that way
I'm taking your side by trying to help you get some perspective about this.
my brother's dead, Keith ! I don't need anymore fucking perspective !
I just need to be loved !
Oh, shit.
this keeps fucking happening. I can't - Go to your room. - Why ?
because I told you to. Go to your room.
I'll eat some more salad. - Get out !
come on.
David, you have to try and relax.
I'm trying. - Try harder.
it's been on the market for six months.
Vanessa. - It's been reduced twice.
Vanessa, I know this place.
I don't wanna buy it. It's chuck weingarden's old funeral home.
he always had water trouble in the basement.
maybe he's fixed it to sell it.
or...
he's selling it because he knows he can't fix it
without tearing the whole place down.
you'd have to see it to find out, wouldn't you ?
Rico, our lives should be ours to win or lose,
not the Fishers. Our lives should be ours.
Oh, don't spill that. Here.
it's higher than it was before.
doctor said the fever might last through the night.
sometimes the antibiotics take a while to kick in.
she's rubbing her ear like it still hurts her.
Ruth, she's getting better.
don't worry.
we could raise her, couldn't we ?
um... well,
we're a little old,
but yeah, sure.
we could. - I think we could too.
it seems right somehow.
can you get us a cold towel for her forehead ?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
Thanks, mom.
I wouldn't want anyone else to take care of her but you.
I love her so much.
I know you do.
when I see you touch her forehead like that, I can feel it on mine
when I was little
in this same room late at night sitting by the bed.
before Claire, before David.
when it was just dad and you and me. And everything was gonna be all right.
my poor sick little girl.
I used to think that I'd have more people in my life
as time went on.
it doesn't work that way.
I'm starting to realize that.
it's almost like as we get older,
the number of people that completely get us shrinks.
right.
until we become so honed by...
our experiences and...
time and...
nobody else understands.
Yeah.
that sounds about right.
be sure to tell the baby that.
first thing right when it comes out.
why did you have to die ?
it really sucks.
everything's unraveling since you're gone.
that's not true.
it feels that way.
I miss you.
I miss you so fucking much !
I miss you too.
you know how I always used to tell you you weren't dad
after dad died ?
Yeah.
it was such a waste of time thinking that way.
no, it's just part of how you dealt with it, that's all.
it kept you from missing dad so much. - No, it kept me from ever knowing you
like as much as I really could have.
and now you are so completely fucking gone !
it's... It's just- - Claire.
what ? ! it sucks !
stop listening to the static.
what the fuck does that mean ?
nothing. It just means that everything in the world is like this...
transmission
making its way across the dark.
but everything. Death, life, everything,
it's all completely suffused with static.
you know ?
but if you listen to the static too much, it fucks you up.
are you high ?
I am actually, yeah. I'm quite high.
you are ?
what the fuck was that ?
I don't know.
Nate, what is that ? - I don't know.
you know everything about the entire fucking universe,
but you don't know what's out there right now, in the dark ?
Claire, you have to get out of here.
fuck !
I thought you went to bed.
I can't.
she's doing somersaults,
playing on a drum set.
can I feel ?
Yeah, sure.
I love your baby.
thank you.
I'm gonna kind of miss having her inside me.
but it'll be really nice to get my body back.
I think you look beautiful.
I do. I've known you ever since I was born. And...
I think you look more perfect to me now than ever.
come on. - What ?
all right, fine. I'll shut up.
What'd you do that for ?
because I wanted to.
I love you.
I don't really even know what I mean by that.
I love you so much.
I love you too.
can I hold you ?
of course you can.
it's okay. It's okay.
it's okay.
you wanna touch it ?
I want you to.
do you wanna ?
okay.
that's what your penis would look like if you were a boy.
I was thinking the same thing.
your fabled gemini optimism Can be tempered with wisdom
and still survive.
greet news from long lost friends with suspicion.
you have more enemies than you think.
okay. Let's read grandpa's.
aries, think about what you say, Before you speak.
Claire's not in the coach house. - So ?
she probably stayed at
what's his name ? Tom's.
Ted. She's not answering her cell phone.
well, it's not even 8: 00.
they're young. They sleep.
and they don't call back.
George, I missed saying goodbye to my son. I'm not going to miss...
Ruth... - I want to know where my daughter is !
if you go out for recess
you stay on the school grounds. You don't wander off.
and I'll be waiting outside the principal's office inside the building
to pick you up at the end of the day, you got it ?
we get it. Let's go. - Boys ! come here.
I am sorry I got upset and used bad language at dinner last night.
that was not right. - Can we make pizza tonight ?
sure.
I, um...
I just miss your uncle Nate a lot right now, you guys.
a lot.
and... And it's been harder than I thought it would be to move on.
we're gonna be late.
okay, you're right. Good boy, go ahead.
have a good day !
excuse me ! did you see that ? - What ?
I think that might be the dark blue nissan they're looking for.
the guy who's murdering children.
that car's not blue, it's black.
sorry.
my mistake.
you're sure you wa me to move out ?
it's not like a rejection or anything.
I know that. - Maya will need a room.
you've got a whole life to get back to.
I get all that, I do, I just...
I mean, do you think you're gonna be okay when the baby comes ?
no.
not at all. - So...
Billy, I'm not saying that when the baby comes You won't be here 18 hours a day.
I'm just saying that...
I gotta get my fucking shit together. And...
we need the space.
so, when are you gonna pick her up ? - This afternoon.
why the fuck did I tell them they could keep her ?
don't beat yourself up, just go get her. She's your daughter.
you're the best mother she could have.
all right.
I'm gonna go pack my shit up.
shit !
Oh, finally.
stop.
what the fuck ? !
I'm not dead ! - I'm sorry, I thought
I'm sorry. I'm a funeral director... - Kill me !
kill me, whoever the fuck you are ! kill me ! I wanted to die. Please !
this is not happening. - Kill me, you motherfucker !
I can't live like this. I don't want to fucking be here !
this is not fucking happening !
okay, maybe it isn't.
but that doesn't mean you're not totally fuckin' alone.
you're gonna die, David. Just like Nate,
just like your dad, just like everybody.
I am aware of the reality of death.
I work with it every day. - And you're scared.
you're more scared now than you've ever been in your life.
you thought you knew what fear was when Jake poured gas all over your head.
but this...
this simple unavoidable fact
that you're alive and alone,
and then someday
you'll be dead. Gone.
stop it. - You'll never see Keith after that.
so where are you gonna go ?
I don't know.
just away.
I'll find another job somewhere.
why ?
because you're okay now. Everything's fine.
I'm not necessary. I'm not.
and when were you gonna tell me that you were leaving ?
I would have called you whenever I got there.
wherever I end up.
but you, you've got family here.
no, Daddy, I don't have family here.
I have some people that I've ruined
and that I've ruined myself in front of.
that's all I have. - What the hell's that supposed to mean ?
do you remember anything, Daddy ?
I mean, do you wake up every morning
you left us !
you left me and brian
with mom when she was so fucked up
and you don't even say goodbye ?
sorry. - Don't be.
that's the way life is, right ?
I mean, you ruin things, you walk away.
you go somewhere else until it's ruined
Maggie, it's not true.
we all try to do our best
I am so sick of pretending everything's okay
just so that you like me. I hate you !
I hate that you dragged me into this world
and you left me here !
just let me go !
why did we leave school early ?
I rented some movies and got the stuff to make pizza.
I was missing you guys.
did something happen to Keith ?
no.
then why are we going home ? for real.
I just wanted to spend some time with you, is that all right ?
whatever.
just gonna have to call somebody to get my math homework for me.
do you want to go back to school ? - I didn't say that.
because I can turn around and take you back if you'd like it so much.
answer me, do you want to go back to school ?
no !
I just wanted to see you. I thought you'd be happy to get out of school.
I'm sorry if I ruined your day.
David, I just found the guy downstairs,
totally not ready for the viewing.
I am here all alone. It would be a real treat to know where the fuck you are.
call me.
Mr. Diaz ?
Yes, Mrs. Duncan, I'll be right out.
okay.
listen, if you can get out of work early
I could really use your help.
Yeah. Yeah, now. I know.
J... Just come if you can.
I will owe you forever, I will take you to water grill.
could you just come ? Bye-bye.
you get a hold of you ? - Yeah, thanks.
I'll give you 800. - What ?
that's like nothing. I mean, it's a Cadillac.
I know what it is. I'm buying it for parts.
seven. - You just said eight.
I know, but you're making it very hard to do you a favor.
you should be thinking how lucky you are to be alive, young lady,
instead of trying to jack up the price on a totaled car.
950. - Done.
come on, boys, roll her over.
get her out of here.
get the chains on over.
can I join you ?
I guess.
you work here ? - No, my husband does. I'm helping out.
I'm vanessa.
we are living in, like,
the unluckiest time ever.
I know it feels that way sometimes.
I mean, I grew up thinking I was born
in the time when there was the internet, you know ?
and the fall of communism. And the gap.
turns out my time is when there's like 9/11, a bunch of wars
and the end of everything.
what ?
do you have kids ?
no.
I was just thinking that I love my kids.
and I know it's a hard time,
but I still feel like there's a lot of good in this world.
and I feel like there's a lot of beautiful things
and I'm glad that my kids get to live to see them.
my brother's dead. - I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure he was a good man. - He was fine.
that's all he needed to be.
that's all anyone needs to be, is fine.
they shouldn't have to get destroyed.
you're right.
did you pack her things ?
not exactly.
I called an hour ago.
you told her I called, right ? - Yeah.
george told me... He told me that you were feeling like
you needed to have her back again, but I think...
she's been so happy here.
okay, george, could you please take Maya upstairs
and pack her things ?
or do I have to call the police ?
Oh, Brenda ! call the police ?
it's all right. Come on, up we go.
Hey, we'll go wash your doll. Come on.
why are you doing this ?
all I am doing is taking my daughter home.
after you left her here like a bag of garbage.
I left her with you because it was the most responsible - Thing I could think of doing. - Responsible ?
I never left my children. I never left them for a second !
I wouldn't ! I couldn't !
Nate fucked maggie the night before he died.
that's not true. - Yes, it is. It is true, Ruth.
it's as true as anything you know.
and I needed some time to work through my anger about that
before I could be a good mother to that little girl, who I love.
I love as much as my own baby and who I am taking home.
Oh my god.
Oh my gosh ! - Sit down.
what's happening ? - Your water is breaking.
no ! no, it can't. It's too early.
just sit down. I'll get you to the hospital.
Maya can stay here with George.
no.
Oh, shit !
this movie's gay.
what is gay, Durrell ?
really, what is gay ?
movies with no talking.
is the pizza ready ?
almost, I just put it underneath the broiler
to melt the cheese a little more.
stay right there. - Who is it ?
I don't know.
who's there ?
no ! don't ! no, please ! please don't kill him !
they're gonna die anyway !
something's burning ! - Something's burning !
what ? - The pizza's burning !
what's the matter with you ? - Nothing's the matter with me, Durrell.
don't talk to me that way ! - What did we do ?
you didn't do anything ! not everything is about you !
what the hell is going on in here !
Anthony, come with me. Jesus Christ.
so, your mom came right over.
she helped everyone get seated.
she even talked to people afterwards.
the whole nine yards.
was it sad ?
Yeah, it was.
but it felt good.
you know, to be there for people. It did.
I called the realtor.
I'm gonna go see that place tomorrow at noon
if you want to come.
are they asleep ?
almost.
David, you got to...
I don't know.
I know.
it isn't good for the boys to be around you like this.
I know. I know.
I feel like...
what ?
Keith, I feel like my face is coming off.
I keep trying to hold it on,
but I can't. It keeps coming off.
what's underneath is just...
I don't want the boys to go away.
I have no intention of sending the boys anywhere.
good.
but I do think that you should go away for a little while.
till you...
until you get better.
the boys are scared to be around you right now, David.
they don't even want to be in the same room with you.
it's not good.
fuck.
is my baby okay ? tell me, is my baby gonna be okay ?
just keep pushing. Just keep pushing.
fuck !
the lesson's not to be taught, son, it's given
that mason you slinging is for your own prison
you all just running in place because the earth is still spinning what's really hidden is how it creeps
you think the world's outside of you but your pores are sore over how it seeps
it ain't all that deep
everybody's clocking the clock, fruit flies, sequoias and peeps
you try to grow long arms and rough calluses spawn on your palms from caressing the stars and beating the street's drum we're all locked in the hunter's sights
you can try and make moves, but even uranium's got a half-life
the streets is more than stutter steps and glass pipes
they'd be like night constellations, trapped in the pavement
it would be, like, listen up and hear this, fool
this is your life
life, life
the stars touch the horizon on all sides, and you try to hear the earth spin and feel the heavens purge their fake promises of mercy
I am so devoid of human touch, me on my back is a blessing
fuck you.
you got the wrong man. l didn't do shit.
forgive me if this poem is inadequate
but I already told you there'd be night constellations trapped in the pavement
they would be, like, listen up and hear it, fool, this is your life
life, life
listen up and hear it, fool
this is your life
life
life what's going on? l didn't do shit.
Jim Brown. chairman Mao.
you done fucked up now.

my office, the library, classrooms. -Why did you call me, Virgil?
you got great test scores at paul Revere. -You fired me.
l had to, Ben. You know that.
look, my funding here is tied to quotas and test scores.
l need an asshole. A guy who is not afraid of these kids.
who's willing to push them, and push them hard to get those scores.
now if you toe the line, get the kids' grades...
maybe you can get your career back on track.

Garcia. Keep that shit up and you'll lose your phone rights.

l hope so. For your sake.
come here now.
are you seeing anybody right now? -Ben, l've got work to do.
ls that Fredriquo?
how's my baby boy? How's Fredriquo?
he's good.
these streets got a pulse and a rhythm carry messages and vibrate like djembes if you know how to listen

at least one broken child for every missing father
these streets made me
and these streets gave me, fed me and prayed with me
eventually and finally, they played me we want to get a record of this...
l want everybody to be as honest as you possibly can.

l love kids. l just love them.
l can't have any of my own...
Rosa Rivera. First time teaching.
l teach science.
and l'm going to squeeze some art in.
l was almost a statistic...
a high school drop-out in the 10th grade.
one thing l would like to say or make very clear...
we're not here to judge these kids.
we're here to educate them.
whatever they did or how they got here, that's really none of our business.
I'm Ben cross...
math teacher.
and English.
Ben cross, l know that name. weren't you in the papers a few years back?
no. l'm a math teacher.
what would l be doing in a newspaper? -Okay, good.
let's move on. Thank you. welcome.
Yes, very good. Thank you.
this is captain O'Leary. He's the one that's running the unit here.
so, captain.
l'm not here to be anybody's friend.
l am here to run a unit smoothly.
our new warden has a program here we call TEAMS.
total Efficiency Accountability Management System.
you are now all a part of my team.
on a good day, we have over 1 7, 000 inmates.
over 2, 000 of them, kids.
what's up now, motherfucker? -Back to work.
bitch ass.
Shackleton is primarily a detainees facility.
most inmates are awaiting trial or sentencing or shipment upstate.
excuse me. Doesn't that mean that some of them are legally innocent?
pens. Mr. McDowell, please pass out the pens.
pens, lock them inside your desk.
pens can kill.
this is all they're allowed.
lock up your text books, also. Use only photocopies.
things can get out of hand before you know it.
ln a place like this it doesn't take a match to light a fire.
read the inmate rule book, Mr. McDowell.
report violations to me.
these violations result in various punishments...
including going to the box. Solitary.
lf they are caught with contraband, they can go to the box.
lf they steal, they go to the box.
lf they swear, talk escape, talk sex talk, disregard a guard, have drugs, it's the box.
lt's one of our best disciplinary tools.
a high percentage of our inmates are HlV positive.
please exercise caution.
welcome to the team.
be careful.
thank you, captain O'Leary.
good morning, sir.
good morning, captain. -what's the status?
sector three is clear. Beginning of school.
walk it out.
l'm not sure how familiar you all are with computers.
damn, can't get no fucking internet on this shit.
l promised my boys porn, baby. -There's no internet allowed for inmates.
the name's El perro, bitch. The Dog.
top Dog.
sit your fucking, Mr. Magoo-looking, faggot-ass down before l get hungry, bitch.
Yeah, that's right, down there. Shit.
fucking boot that shit up.
okay guys, this is science.
and l know you're wondering what we're doing with all this art stuff.
but art, just like science, is about experimentation. Are you ready?
go.
today we're going to talk about great men.
gandhi, Martin Luther King, Mandela.
but first, l want you to take a look at me.
l am the descendant of slaves.
want to know how my people broke their chains?
education.
now look at you. Slaves.
to crime, apathy, drugs. -Shit.
lady, l ain't no fucking slave. You know what l'm saying?
hold it!
ln this class, l am your mama.
you do not raise your voice or curse at your mama.
am l clear?
now let's get to work.
you're it?
what's your name, man?
l stole a watch. l needed to know what time the busses come for work.
read chapter One. l'll be right back.
guard!
watch him.
how come they're always standing? -Maybe they like us. Like to watch us.
pretty, just stop right there.
listen up.
this is a teacher from the new school. Any of you that want to can attend.
man, fuck that, fuck you, fuck the school.
Jheri-curl-wearing motherfucker. -Yeah, man.
listen up, brothers. -Fuck you.
you ain't my brother.
right. Glad we cleared that up.
look, don't you guys want a chance at an education?
maybe turn your lives around?
we didn't just fall through the cracks. we were pushed.
word up.
you pushed us.
we gonna push you back.
don't you kids take responsibility for your own lives?
who do you think you are? -Look at you.
don't you want better than this?
expand your lives. Maybe expand your vocabulary.
man, there's only one word that we need to know. That's " shit. "
because you could be shit-faced, shit out of luck...
shit for brains. You can buy shit. -Smoke shit.
sell shit. -You can catch shit or lose shit.
or you can find yourself in deep shit with a life worth shit.
okay.
all right, so why you give a shit?
me, l don't. lt's just a paycheck.
loser, man. Because teachers get paid shit.
Yeah, word. lt's why they dress like that.
don't you cats want out of here?
what the fuck you think?
not me. They got me eating good. My cousin's here.
my daddy's up in this beat, baby.
all right, one-on-one.
one-on-one? You and me? -Yeah.
all right, old-timer, we'll game it up to 1 1 . -All right.
what's the stakes, though?
lf l win, you and your homeboys come to class.
lf l lose... -You'll lose, man.
l'm taking bets, man.
on the teach.
l've got you, too.
you know what you're doing? -He's a kid. Just a kid.
come on, man. What you got?
Yeah, motherfucker.
3-3.
are you going to play? -Let's go.
Hey, the NBA try-outs are next week. -Little motherfucker.
come on, baby.
Yeah, that's what l'm talking about.
get the fuck out of here. -What the fuck is he doing?
now you're just a loser, homey.
all right, Gabriel, back off!
let's go now!
you're not too good at recruiting.
are all the guards as charming as you?
let me give you some free advice.
whatever worked for you on the outside, forget it.
let's go, walk it off now!
l thought l told you to read chapter One.
l can't read.
of course you can't.
as legions of the remainders meet this riff is one of survival
like a giant tent-circus-style revival
little boys gloating over alpha-male sports knowledge
like, " Man, I'm in state pens. "
now quick, do it in reverse
that will bring you blessings personal appeals written to sneaker magnates whose only response.' stacks of discount coupons
leaving you curled in the corners, drunken and abused
that's what this man's dreams are made of
now I see the universe in the streets, and you all say, " He crazy! "
shit, that may be. How would you know?
if you ain't never been there yourself how would you recognize someone who was really free?
okay, Minnow.We'll start with the basics. All right?
all right, come on.
l lost.
you're still the loser.
we're going to bounce if we don't like it, so get to teaching, Mr. Minnow.
all right, in the back. Wake up.
wake up now, partner. Up. First off, welcome.
all right, look. l teach math and English.
l'm confused, so what are you going to teach?
a comedian, you're a regular George Lopez. Very funny.
l'll tell you what.
bring that much energy to class, you might graduate.
all right, take these, pass them down.
time to do the count. On your feet, girls, into the hall.
they just got here. -Got to make sure no one goes missing.
come on. -On your feet, little fish.
you want to see the back of my hand, El perro?
going to see a hell of a lot more than that. -Really?
you got something to say now?
what's up, little brother, you got nothing to say?
Mr. Mouth. what you got to say?
can l help you out?
this is a school.
you do the count.
$50 a day.
that's how little the State pays per inmate.
my officers were stretched thin as it was.
now, taking inmates to and from class, it's too much.
most expensive aspect of running this prison is personnel.
so, if lpc doesn't work-- -lpc?
lnterpersonal communication Skills.
lf those don't work...
intimidation and fear are just some of the other options in our team toolbox.
team toolbox. Do you ever listen to yourself?
l'm telling you, you're not going to be stormtrooping your way into my class.
thank you, captain. Thank you for your time.
open gate 24.
this is bullshit, Virgil. You don't have to bend over for this guy.
l'm not going to be assaulted by some team toolbox.
stop.
Ben, you have got to choose your battles.
we can't go against the corrections staff.
ls that clear? -l guess it is.
do you know how much l got to pay to get my babies into a good school?
these kids, they don't give a shit.
and it's on my dime and in my time?
that burns my ass.
you ever stop to think what my job is like? How scared l am?
the game face l got to put on to make it through the day.
they throw piss and shit at me.
lf l turn my back, they will slice me.
l am not the bad guy here.
okay?
close 24.
we need more kids. -We need less violent kids.
no, we got to come up with something to motivate these kids.
l don't want to be looking for another job.
they love to compete.
Yeah, they thrive on it.
you know, in college we held spelling bees for the kids.
half these kids can't read.
so this would challenge them. -Challenge them out of the classroom.
we got to come up with something these kids care about.
all they care about is themselves. And scaring the hell out of me.
excuse me?
may l help you? -Hi, Louise Gibbons. Board of Education.
sent to monitor the school.
second day, right? How did it go?
wonderful, beautiful. As to be expected.
how many students have you signed up? -Thirty.
thirty. You realize the minimum is 85.
we're just sort of getting started.
lf you don't get the 85 by the month's end, you lose your state funding.
that won't be a problem.
mom, please don't cry.
you're better off without him.
how's Freddy, man, you seen Freddy?
he's good. -Yeah?
he's just-- -He looks like me, right?
no, he looks like me.
listen, Carlos. l need you to stand up for me, all right?
Monica's mom, she got me this lawyer.
l just need you to be my alibi, all right?
you tell them l'm innocent. You know what l'm saying?
you tell them that you was with me.
listen to me, stay with me, all right?
poems for a dollar?
sister, l'll hook you up, l'll change your life for a dollar.
you know what l'm saying, sister? poems for a dollar.
twenty-six letters, it's all we got to survive. All right, l got you.
my man, you know you peoples was wrong, right?
l'm just fucking with you.
poems for a dollar. Come on, restitution for a dollar.
l'll turn it all around for just a dollar. Poems for a dollar.
my man. Where you been at? All right. Good looking out.
there you go.
l appreciate it. You know what? Hold up, son.
l told you, l'd change your life for a dollar.
check it out. -All right.
change it up for a dollar. Hooked you up, my man.
good looking out.
poems for a dollar.
l will hook you up, switch it up. Change it over for just a dollar.
now you got that look, and you need a poem in your life, sister.
get lost! -All right, okay.
shit.
two new recruits today. Samuel Jefferson, James Lattrell.
fuck all that man. l'm Double B, and this is my nigger Sammy One right here.
so, respect.
Yeah, that's what l'm talking about, man.
that's it, ladies and gentlemen. That's what l'm talking about.
l want you to express yourselves.
all right, look. Check this out.
all right, listen up.
'l saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness " Starving, hysterical, naked " Dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn " looking for an angry fix " Angelheaded hipsters, burning for the ancient heavenly connection " to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night. "
you hear this guy? This guy is talking from in here.
anybody know what he's saying? -He's talking about fucking himself up...
by getting fucked up all the time.
elegantly put. Anybody else?
l thought you were supposed to be an English teacher, this ain't no English.
look, this man is telling us who he is by talking about himself.
and that is what l'm looking for here. l want you to tell me who you are.
look. Let's try this. Somebody, tell me how you feel.
l feel l gotta take a fucking piss, man.
you know what, we're gonna put it down because we gotta start somewhere.
somebody else? -l feel like l'm pissed off.
you feel pissed off. All right, pissed off. There we go.
somebody else. Minnow, you want to say something?
tell me how you feel, man.
man, leave him alone. Let the man tell us how he feels.
how do you feel, Minnow? -Scared.
scared so l wanna scream. -Good, Minnow, great.
scared.
somebody else, anybody else. -l feel like some big, juicy booty.
you want booty? Hopefully not in here.
booty, all right. That's what you want.
somebody else? -Rejected.
you feel rejected, okay.
keep it coming, this is great.
l miss my nine milli. l want my heat. What's up?
l miss my mother, l miss my bed. -You miss your mother, you miss your bed.
all right. -l miss your mother, too!
what? What you gonna do?
anybody else? -Hope is dope.
hope is dope.
what? -Hope is dope?
you on dope, dog. Why you saying hope is dope, man?
you. -That's Gabriel.
l know who he is. Don't you want to get involved?
this is bullshit.
no man. This is truth.
this is his truth.
that is their truth. That's what poetry is. Truth.
this is all bullshit This is all extra slow motion
nothing here moves with the quickness except when the DA provides lying witnesses
this is the same prison as the projects, just the walls got different thicknesses
you, me, in the penitentiary, it's all bullshit
but we still be working it. We all lie all the time
but every once in a while, the truth surfaces
it will only be a quick minute before bullshit returns to us
that's right. You know what l'm saying.
even though you're straight bullshitting, you don't knowjack-shit about me. Why?
I'm supposed to thank you for lying to me?
man, I get better treatment from a stranger at a deli
I thank you like they do in the Korean stores. " Next "
and they're trying to feed us the crumbs off the bank floors for less
that's right. You know what l'm saying?
you like it today?
scratching your heads thinking, " Is this fool spitting poems or rap? " Well, check it
truth happened at the start of the crime scene
and it blows on the yellow tape, flapping in the night breeze
truth mixes it in with bullshit and rehab
the fix is in, you should have wrapped your left jab
bullshit!
shows up when you talk about the shit you could have had
now the truth, on the other hand coats the inside of glass stems and it's where children sleep, and planets rest
it's as familiar and far away as the sunset
now bullshit's when you say you got a girl when you know you just bought a blowjob from a crack whore
that's what l'm talking about, yeah.
it's when you tell your son, " Daddy's gotta go on vacation "
it's when they find your gun, " It wasn't me, I was rocking Playstation "
it's when you wanna blast blunts with the sticky-icky tobacco but your boys be like " That fool is locked in Shackles "
now you tell me, fool
you know something about my life?
or did I just finish bullshitting you?
poetry. A competition. We got to motivate these kids, right?
get them fired up?
you know how competitive they are. We get them writing about themselves.
make it a competition. And the winner gets a
what? Gets to go to the Bahamas?
exactly, Randolph. The Bahamas.
or the citywide poetry competition? The finals were held at my school last year.
a poetry slam. -What?
we do need more kids. Fast.
the Bahamas.
there you go, a list of poets.
lnspiration, they're all available in the library.
we're going to have our first slam, a week Monday.
and we're going to have a round table workshops to help you guys out.
don't worry, Minnow, l got you covered.
what if you have nothing to write about? -Man, your name is pretty.
you got a lot to write about.
Ben, you got a phone call. Sounds urgent.
all right, can you watch my class?
Yes, Doctor, of course l'm aware that l've missed some meetings.
Yes, l do know what the court said about my situation.
that's not it at all, Doctor. l'm working now.
all right!
tonight. Fine.
l remember where l heard your name.
you had that problem back at paul Revere a few years back, right?
you win the prize. That's me.
who wants to start tonight? Ben cross?
since you missed the last three sessions, why don't you go?
okay, let's work on our poetry. Who wants to go first?
look, Doctor, I read all the books that you gave me...
and l guess for some of these people, it makes sense.
l just ain't connecting with that shit, you know?
l know how l feel... -l know how l feel...
l've got this rage. lt's building up inside of me.
and it's not that l can't control it, you know, it's just that...
it was a mistake.
something went wrong. lt was an isolated incident.
do l deserve all this?
do l? You know l made one mistake. -l paid my dues. God knows, l paid my dues.
this is all fucked, if you ask me.
what l got to say doesn't come from no books.
from no dead guys, no dead white guys who don't know shit about me, about us.
you want me to talk about who l am. Now, how can l do that? How?
fuck you, man.
l'm going to write about what's real, you know...
about the truth. -Truth.
lt's all the truth l know. -Who the fuck knows what truth is?
we got to learn how to control the anger.
that's bullshit and you know it.
that's it, gentlemen, pack it up for the night. Lights out.
all right, you all, welcome to the first Annual Shackleton poetry Slam, all right?
every contestant is going to do one poem. Judges are in the front row.
they're going to judge and score from one to ten.
you guys give each contestant a lot of encouragement.
our first contestant.
big round of applause for Page kennedy.
that's seven contestants out of almost 30 students. That's not bad.
when I'm in prison, doing time
I think about you, with sweet wine where's Gabriel Garcia?
you're my bitch and my homey
I let you kiss me but not bone me
damn it.
even though there's laws to prevent and stop us
the same laws that wouldn't let you get on the bus
let me see you for a minute, come on.
you will always be my D-A-G-G
I want you, please
so I'm on my knees
I miss you dear, whisper in my ear
my favorite dog
y'all niggers act like y'all can do it, why y'all didn't get up here...
you know what I'm saying? Y'all always got something to say.
what the hell are you doing?
watching the show. They said l had to or some shit. l don't know what the hell
so, wait a minute. You're not going to compete?
what for? lt's a bullshit contest.
bullshit? Gabriel, you are the best kid in the class.
man, don't you want to win something for once in your life?
what for?
what for? lt all goes bad eventually, right?
you wanna get my hopes up?
l get it. l do.
you're afraid. Yeah, you are.
you're one of those chicken shit little bastards who talk the talk.
but you can't walk the walk. Good. That's fine.
you think l give a shit if you win or not?
the only reason l cared is because some of those students look up to you.
and maybe they'd have a chance to turn their lives around if somebody would show them an example.
cause now all of them get to see you for what you really are.
you're a coward. -Fuck you.
no, baby. Fuck you.
ls everything all right? -Everything's cool. Gonna make it happen.
all right.
our next contestant is Johnny Gilmore.
Yes, I love the sky and the birds
and the trees
and the geese
and of course, dirt and cheese
I ain't got no mom, no daddy, too
just trying to get by in this world that's blue
yo, I'm jumping, and I'm pumping, and I'm banging along my way
being locked up in this joint is, like, same shit, different day
I don't want no witch, no snitch
just my very own jailhouse bitch
so? who gonna be my bitch?
all right.
I love my mom, she's all I got
but her taste in men sucks a lot
her last boyfriend treated her like shit
he said he'd be over at 6.'00, but he doesn't show up
not cool, in my school
I hate when people lie
I hate to see her cry
so when he stood her up on her birthday, that was out of line
I tracked him down and stabbed him 40 times
gotta love the bitch.
for her 40th
my present to her then and now
she doesn't stop crying
and now I'm in here dying
you ask me if I would do it again?
just put me on the spot
I love my mom
she's all I got
all right, motherfucker, l got something for your ass.
our next contestant is Minnow.
son, l got something here. Something loose right here.
l'm not kidding you. -You got a shiv?
Yeah. -You don't have to do it if you don't want to.
l want to do it. -You got to get on stage. Come on.
Hey, all right, let him speak.
come on, fish!
minnow, you got to speak up, son.
silence inside me what the fuck is that?
death dawns like sunrise's beam
go on, you can do it, son.
seasons change
that was our last contestant, so the judges will tabulate the scores...
hold up. l got something to say.
I'm a long shot
but I still make moves and breathe, because this life is all I got
I tried to write, but I stress my girl and she sighs a lot
I tried to write but good intentions don't really buy a lot
this is an island full of long shots
but the streets and corners is all we got
yo, check the snapshot
right now, some ghetto child is thinking " when I big up, I'm gonna get me some mad Cuban links "
and he zoned out staring at the roaches in the sink
and even though the stars shine down on him he on the brink and he ain't got no jump shot
so, it's Mickey D's or the streets and what do you think?
we ain't the only ones on the long shot brink check it
I want to take it back to before you felt less than
I want the voices back to how my Grandpa was blessed then 'cause this is my life and you can't have this
even if your mama told you, you could probably handle it
this is the true ballad of the long shot in case you can't understand it 'cause we live boxed up in concrete and steel on what should be called a Devil's Island
but the stakes are so high
if you close your eyes and listen
I think this is where God lives
there's a goddess in the rivers, hoping to wash our sins
but these scars I carry ain't definitive 'cause we all got marks that show that we lived
Oh, we weren't supposed to make it this far but we're still here and got mad love to give, 'cause we all up in this whether we be either both sons or fathers
if you're feeling your boy, I need you to holler!
if you're feeling like a long shot, holler!
if you're feeling your boy, I need you to holler!
if you're feeling like a long shot, holler!
Gabriel Garcia is not leaving these premises...
for some poetry slam.
no, the Dept. of corrections will not-- -we don't work for the Dept. of corrections.
we work for the Dept. of Education.
lt's true.
maybe we should take it up with the warden.
since l was appointed to this position two months ago...
my focus has been on overhauling a system...
that has allowed violence to be at an all-time high here at Shackleton.
when inmates are happy and have a goal, they are much easier to manage.
this isn't a country club. -Captain, hear them out.
sir.
lf we're allowed to use Gabriel Garcia, as an example, he is a leader
of a gang. -No, he's just somebody the kids respect.
sir, if you turn one kid around, the rest will follow.
you're overloaded with kids.
we hadn't planned on this. -l bet you hadn't.
the most expensive part of running this prison is manpower.
we can't afford any additional people.
to turn one kid around-- -Gentlemen, please.
you must know that this is unprecedented.
and that is exactly why you should endorse it.
lf it works, think of the good press that will come out of this.
yo, son. So l just heard it.
Gabriel's cousin, Carlos, the wimpy one.
word on the street is our boy is talking to a lawyer...
to get him to testify. Trying to get that kid Garcia out of here.
what the fuck you want to do?
okay, gentlemen, into your cells. Lock it up for the night. Everybody inside.
Carlos, got a message for you.
from Sammy One.
he's got a gun!
all right. You.
write the next line, anything you want.
how's your cousin, man, he all right?
single file, hands by your sides. One line. walk it out, let's go.
quiet. walk it out.
man, what's happening? -You stay here.
lockdown, on your feet! Hurry up!
step lively! Stay here, you'll be more secure in there.
lockdown.
let's go!
what are you doing?
don't hit him in the face.
this is just the kind of violence the warden and l feared...
in such a lax environment with a high number of inmates.
you know goddamn well that no students could have done this.
are you suggesting my guards did this? -l am not suggesting shit.
l know they did it. -l see.
we'll just have to launch an investigation.
just file a complaint, and we'll suspend all the guards in this unit...
until we get to the bottom of this.
l see, then there won't be enough guards to walk the students to class.
of course, that would be the fallout.
lt's your choice, Mr. Cross.
lf you want to file, you know where to find me.
Yeah.
l quit.
l quit.
Monica, what's wrong?
no. lt's Carlos.
they got to him.
he's hurt real bad, Gabriel. Shot three times.
they say he won't walk again. Ever.
he ain't gonna testify now.
he's sorry, but...
Gabriel, l had to tell you.
don't you go and do anything stupid.
why can't... Monica, look at me.
he's my cousin, all right. That's my blood. All right, they hurt my cousin.
that's my blood.
man's got to defend his family. -Cut that macho shit.
l am doing my best to get you out of this place.
so don't you go fuck it up.
look me in the eye.
you promised me.
for Freddy?
for Freddy.
just remember if the world didn't suck, we'd all fall off it.
pretty will take care of it. Pretty didn't promise anyone shit.
no. lt's okay.
okay, guys, this is it.
he's out.
this is a lockdown! Get up on your bunks, now!
what?
everything okay down there?
you ready to slam?
our judges will score from one to 10 to choose four semi-finalists.
from that two finalists will go to the state capital...
for the All-State championships and a chance at a scholarship.
let's go around back.
all right, from Alexander Hamilton High...
our very own Anna McDonald.
I love the color of your skin
it's so creamy, coffee, beautiful that I want you to be in me when those white girls say, " please step aside "
my skin's got you tripping, you want a ticket to ride this?
unless you can handle my brain and my body what makes you think you even deserve this hottie?
you and your crew don't even really see me
Rasheed, you wanna take those chains off him?
come on, Rasheed, let's get a kid a break.
l get to get out of these chains. Mr. Cross.
Gabriel, remember this is your day.
lt's mine to fuck up, is what you're saying.
Yeah, it's pretty much what l'm saying. -At least you're honest.
l'm not going to hug you if that's what you're looking for.
what, and ruin your reputation as a hardened criminal?
Rasheed, take him backstage, get him changed into street clothes...
l'll see you guys in the auditorium.

a parable? punch line, a bad man?
so what if I sling some rocks to get out of the quicksand check it
I'm gonna put it all on blast, the life I described ain't a path, it's a mineshaft
sometimes you got to be buried like that Deep

all right, judges.
Mr. Cross, l'm principal Jim Travers from Hamilton High.
l understand you're responsible for bringing this inmate here.
but he's a good kid. lt was an experiment. -No need to apologize.
lnnovative thinking. l'm always looking for that at our school.
you made our kids sit up and take notice, that's not easy.
l may be looking for somebody like you. Here's one of my cards. You call me, okay?
Absolutely.
and there's more to come. Semi-finals are in two weeks.
so, let's meet our four semi-finalists.
from Shackleton High, Gabriel Garcia.
motherfuckers!
ladies and gentlemen, these are your four semi-finalists.
give it up.
Where's Pretty at?
how's he doing?
he had a pen shoved two inches into his brain. Not well.
has his family been here to see him yet? -what family?
this place is...
Gabriel, what does that blanket mean?
means that someone's died in the infirmary. come on.
let's go now.
good Morning, Officer. -Morning.
principal Jim Travers from Hamilton High School.
just here to observe.
the kids are just going in.
l'll have someone come take you down in just a bit.
thank you very much.
you was at that slam, right? -Shut it, Garcia.
l saw you do your poem. Very good.
Yeah. So what are you doing? Looking to become a teacher or something?
no, l'm just looking for a teacher.
l was very impressed with your Mr. Cross.
all right, let's take the number...
all right, 60.
sixty is a composite number.
now what prime numbers multiply together to make 60?
what the fuck do you care?
man, of course l care. what are you talking about?
let's forget about math today.
you know, let's talk about other numbers.
like the number of days you got left. -Man, sit down.
fuck you. You been giving us some speeches, right?
why don't you give us another speech, about the slam, the contest?
wake up, man.
you know, giving us those speeches, " l believe in you. l turn your lives around. "
you don't give a shit about us. About anyone but yourself.
what are you talking about, man? -l'm talking about you...
using us to get another gig. To get the hell out of here.
what?
you know what, Gabriel?
whatever is bothering you-- -You're bothering me, dog.
can't you figure that out? can't you see that? You're bothering me.
cause you drag me into this. Now l signed up for that slam.
what you tripping on, G? -You want to know what l'm tripping on?
there's a suit right outside that door.
l just talked to him about this motherfucker right here and his new job.
starting next week-- -what?
sit down. We'll talk about this later. -Hey, fuck you and your later.
there ain't no later.
there's the here, there's the now. You ain't part of it.
that's right. That's enough. -l'm not done yet, motherfucker.
you just wanted more kids in this class...
so you could finish the year and get up out of here.
lt ain't like that, man. Look
tell me you're in for the long haul!
tell it to my fucking face right now. -Say something.
to my fucking face. -l've proved myself here.
you don't give a shit about us. -That's not true.
you're just as much a loser as the rest of us.
we're fucking losers. But you know what? You're more so.
because we have to be here. But you, this is the best you could do.
tell me it's not the truth. Where you at?
fuck you, nigger. -Fuck you!
guard!
motherfucker, you had Double B killed!
l'm gonna bust your ass!
are you seeing me, motherfucker?
where you at?
l'm right here, motherfucker!
are you all right?
fuck you!
the warden just left here.
and Gabriel will not be allowed out for the poetry slam.
none of the students will. You know, Ben, l can't contain this.
Virgil, l never meant to hit Loretta. lt was an accident.
Oh, yeah? You think it looks that way to the warden?
you already attacked her, and l don't need to tell you what that means!
especially with your history.
what history?
he beat a student into a coma a few years back.
what? -All right.
all right, look. -You're out, Ben.
wait a minute, Virgil. -Nothing you can do.
and if Randolph hadn't quit, you'd be gone already.
see, l need teachers.
and as soon as l find your replacement, you're through.
this is getting to be a habit, Virg?
Ben! Wait!
no books for crooks!
caught between a rock and a hard place, bitch
motherfucking rock and hard-times place what's the difference between violence and grace?
the inside of a casket is silent
the more I stare, the less I see
the more I stare...
the less I see
the distance from the street to that fly country house in your head is the same from Shackleton to Atlantis
the distance from me to a righteous path is filled with mock justice and ill manners
it was all clear before
it was all clear
give me my money. Where you going?
stand right here. Did l tell you to move?
l told you the next time you didn't have my money...
l was going to beat your ass... put your hands down there.
you're going to be shitting footprints. Now, where's my money?
get off me, man.
get off me!
l'm not teaching anymore.
maybe never again.
and l don't know why l'm here.
you know how proud l was when Freddy was born?
you told me there was going to be no more trouble.
this isn't... This is not my fault. -Don't. Don't you dare.
l always thought that being a good teacher was about good scores.
but it's not about the scores.
lt's about those kids.
lt's about connecting with them.
maybe even inspiring them.
but then l go and l blow it.
I talked to carlos.
he told me what you asked him to do was to lie.
a man tells the truth. The truth.
there is no truth, baby. Not for me.
you know, l do what l need to do. You know, for Freddy, for you.
you know what drugs do.
so how you gonna go sell that shit? -You know, l got no choice.
l mean, this is my life. l didn't ask for it. -Gabriel, stop.
you're an angry guy, Ben.
three years ago, something terrible happened.
l waited...
for you to stop believing the world owed you something.
for your anger to fade.
that kid you beat up, you've got to get over it, Ben.
let it go.
l don't know if there's anything left for us, Gabriel.
but God gave you a gift. A gift.
l saw it out on that stage. And you made me a promise.
for Freddy.
don't think about me. Don't think about you.
think about Freddy. You have that choice.
what kind of man are you going to be?
good. Gabe, let it all out.
here you go, sir. Drink. There's your burger.
okay. Enjoy, sir. Come back and see us. Have a great day.
hi and welcome
when l woke up in the hospital, my mom told me it was a sign.
a sign to get out of that school.
get a fucking life.
ended up here.
hell, it's somewhere.
look, Kevin, l just came by to say...
l came by to tell you that l'm sorry.
what the fuck is this, man?
some 1 2-step program crap?
l hit you, you hit me. Welcome to America, bro.
no, man. l lost it, man. l was supposed to be a teacher.
what the fuck do l care? Look at me, man.
no, look at me.
l got a job. l keep off the streets.
that's better than most brothers l know.
hell, it's probably better than most brothers you know.
to be honest, man, l'm glad l'm out of that shithole of a school.
education's fucked.
pretty. -Yeah?
pretty, l got to tell you something, man.
Yeah, l hear you.
l'm not innocent.
l sell crack to kids.
that is shit, man.
that is shit.
the sleep of reason produces monsters
and when you look into the abyss the abyss also looks back into you
monasteries offer no hope
I like the noise of the subway
drowning out the screams and the pain
my man keeps falling off onto the rocks again
you want some one-on-one?
shit. You got some nerve showing up here, man.
thought you'd give me a chance, double or nothing.
why don't you just cut the bull?
l get half an hour a day in this motherfucker.
lt's a fucking cage. Just quit fucking with me.
l'm not talking about basketball. l'm talking about you and me. One-on-one.
what do you want from me? -I don't want you to give up on yourself.
you are too special a kid to throw your life away.
you know what it is?
you're looking for your own redemption. That's what it is.
Gabriel, l know what it's like for people to give up on you.
l know what it's like to give up on yourself.
l just want you to know that l'm about to go out on a limb for you.
l just want to know you're there with me.
you up for a fight?
what?
have a seat, Ben.
no, l'm cool. What's up?
the last year at Paul Revere we had 100 incidents of student violence.
that's an average of one violent incident every three days.
nobody called a meeting.
nobody said we should shut the place down.
at Shackleton Academy, on actual school property...
one incident which involved a teacher.
you knew you were on probation.
we have representatives from city, state, and education.
a decision has been made.
lt was an experiment, one that failed.
no one wants to see it continue. Not the penal institution...
not the school board, the Governor's office, not even the public.
and how would you know what the public wants?
Mr. McDowell, we have bent over backwards to make this work for you.
you've been diverting my staff from their duties.
we've had run-ins with your staff.
and one of my guards was seriously injured.
now that is no way to run an efficient business.
efficient business? christ! we are talking about kids' lives here.
the school closes at the end of the business day, Friday.
all right. Do whatever.
just don't deny these kids their poetry slam. Don't deny Gabriel a chance.
Mr. Garcia is a multiple felon.
with this incident, whether he's in or out of the box, there is no way...
he's leaving our facility to attend some poetry contest.
no way.
okay. Your rules.
we have the poetry slam in prison.
excuse me?
l think l can get the Governor to support that.
three, two, one.
l'm Jena Rutherford reporting from Shackleton prison...
where l'm attending the semi-finals of the Annual High School poetry Slam.
Yes, today it's poetry in prison.
this is certainly a fascinating look at how prisons of today work...
and what education means to these kids.
got it? Let's go.
we got some news cameras out there this evening so let's look our best.
always at our best, sir.
move, nigger!
I want to welcome you to Shackleton Academy's semi-finals...
of the Annual poetry Slam.
all right.
tonight is a very, very special night...
and it's not special because of the poetry, because it's not about poetry.
it's about all of the kids at Shackleton.
and this is an opportunity tonight to show them and to show the world...
that they have potential...
and that they are not less than.
so without any further ado...
I'd like to pass off the M-I-c to my main man and dear friend...
a big round of applause for Mr. Duncan Towers.
Hello, Shackleton!
you hear what's going down?
they're closing the school.
...give it up for our first semi-finalist...
you're lying.
caught between a rock and a hard...
put the mike on!
caught between a...
caught between a rock and a hard-times place what's the difference between violence and grace?
the inside of a casket is silent
so is the science
he's freezing up. Excellent.
fate
I can't do this shit.
I can't do this.
listen up. They're closing the school.
Oh, no.
they're closing down the school, y'all. They're shutting it down.
how did this get out? l thought we had more time?
Ben, l have no idea.
this isn't part of the poem. They are closing down this school.
don't you see what's going on?
everything that we are given gets taken away, all of it.
any time we are given something good, gone.
there it is. And this was our shot. Look around.
this was our shot to get out of here and never come back, ever.
that's what they want. They want us to come back.
again and again and again, until we are permanent motherfucking lifers.
hell, no! l ain't coming back! -That's not today's lesson.
today's lesson's.' " Fuck you! You're coming back! "
we are all coming back if they shut down the school.
you're coming back! we're all coming back!
if they close this school, we are coming back!
fuck that! They ain't closing this school.
fuck that! They can't do that shit! we got rights, too!
this could be something really big. Shoot everything.
what the hell is wrong with you? Look what you started.
l'm not the one shutting down the school now, am l?
quiet!
now, I know that you're upset. I am, too.
but we can talk this through. And you, you can be heard.
but you can't do it with violence. Use your words!
keep the school open Respect the word, given and spoken
no more promises broken The long shot has spoken keep the school open The long shot has spoken
ready? Are you guys ready? we're live right now, okay?
keep the school open The long shot has spoken why don't you guys set a time, and as soon as you do...
l'll let you know.
l got to call you back.
this is Jena Rutherford, reporting live from Shackleton prison...
where what was supposed to have been a poetry contest...
has turned into something else entirely.
as you can see behind me, there's a protest going on.
warden? what about the visitors?
the kids say all they want is their constitutional right.
their right to an education. Their right to keep their school open.
and they say they don't understand why the state wants to take that away from them.
I do see Ben Cross, one of the teachers here at Shackleton.
we'll see if we get a statement from him.
the long shot has spoken! Keep the school open!
excuse me, Mr. Cross. Can we speak with you?
listen to these kids. They want a chance.
they want an education.
lt's just that nobody ever asked them.
this school is their last chance. That fork in the road.
this is their last chance to change their lives.
this is our last chance to make a difference.
keep the school open!
get down!
keep school open!
lt's getting dicey in here. Should we evacuate the guests?
lockdown. Send in ESU now.
l'm sorry.
you don't stop rolling.
Oh, my God!
we go now to the chilling last footage of Ben Cross.
a man who is being called a true martyr of this cause.
this image is being replayed all across the country.
listen to these kids.
they want a chance. They want an education.
nobody has ever asked them.
education is about values.
for these kids, this school is their last chance.
that fork in the road.
what path do we want them to choose? What values do we want to impart?
young man, do you know why you're here?
you are here because you are being charged with the murder of Ben Cross.
you will be tried before a jury of your peers.
you are past the age of 18. You will be charged as an adult.
can one teacher change the world, one student at a time?
a while ago, I thought that wasn't possible. But here at Shackleton...
these children have taught me what it was to be a teacher.
to connect and to make a difference.
you think about this, America.
do you want these kids back on your streets in your neighborhoods...
without the opportunity provided by an education? Do you?
they could be the neighbor's kids, they could even be your kids.
you think about that.
the fate of Shackleton Academy is still up in the air.
but what we do know is that the Governor has called for a hearing to determine its future.
welcome.
we'll make this brief, and then have a few minutes for questions.
after much deliberation, reviewing of facts...
the tapes of the incident...
and in particular, the impassioned plea of Mr. Ben Cross...
the Board has decided to reinstate the school at Shackleton.
the school will be on a probationary watch.
however, the school will be given a two-year period...
in which to properly ground itself...
and establish itself as a viable center for education.
ln closing, the members of the special committee would like to express how valuable this school could be and should be.
and that we would like to give it every chance of success.
we'll take questions.
this is their last chance to change their lives.
this is our last chance to make a difference.
these are our youth. They are the youth of America.
caught between a rock and a hard-times place what's the difference between violence and grace?
the inside of a casket is silent So is the science of fate
you can't roll with the new without clean slates
same dream all the time So now before I sleep I hesitate
I hesitate. I'm with this other kid just before the flash
I'm like, " wait, wait, wait "
but all that falls out of my mouth is silence And it's too late 'cause I got smoke in my eyes
but I'm still trying to see some other life
some other life, some other life Some other life
meanwhile, I'm caught between the black and whites and full-scholarship penitentiaries between lives knocked down like bowling pins
and me just trying to be me 'cause we are who we are shadowed by beauty and belligerence
by tenderness and anger
by the unevenness of our affection we are more than the sum of us
the space between the streets and that fly country house in your head
is the distance from Shackleton to Atlantis
space between me and the righteous path is filled with mock justice and ill manners
right now, mad stress represents mental health fractions and partitions myself into contortions and gift boxes
I want to flip the script on the hounds and foxes
all the extra effort and extra classes seems forgotten
I'm constantly projected into parable with the Mountain and Mohammad -I instantly reject the free fall... -...the two summits
there's hope over here and fear on the other
all I got is my brains and heart
but that's just cold comfort
all I got is faith but the scales are slippin' into second guessin'
it was all clear before
but now my whole life is in the form of a question
it was all clear before
but now my whole life is in the form of a question
it was all clear before
I'm not finished yet.
Francis Gallagher, will you marry me?
all I need is a marriage certificate.
I'm gonna be your...your new mom. - Really?
what's your dad gonna do when he gets out of jail and I tell him you spend all day with orange boy rubbing your dicks together?
$500 tomorrow, or I call him.
I try to make a point of not banging my roommates' girlfriends.
why'd you stop by here before class?
because you were hoping I'd be here.
I'm Bonnie. - Carl.
you wanna have some fun? Empty the register!
whoa, shit!
holy fuck.
congratulations, man. Drink on the house.
what for? - The birth of your child?
Yeah, my kid just popped out too.
but my mother-in-law won't let me raise him.
I'm not dying.
I'm just trying to make you as comfortable as possible.
then take me to the Alibi.
get your ass down here, Frank. - What is this?
couldn't bring you to the bar, so we brought the bar to you.
I need a gun.
who you gonna kill? - Just gimme a gun.
you own a bar on the South Side. How the fuck do you not have a gun?
you're allowed to be out from 8: 00 AM to 6: 00 PM.
if you miss curfew, you'll violate the terms of your probation, and you can go back to jail.
you got a job? - I'm working on it.
have you ever been convicted of a felony?
you know, we will be in touch.
you think that you're a good person. You're not.
everything is fucked because of you!
Yeah! Yeah!
these are the last words that will pass between you and your father, your chance to put everything you've ever wanted to say to Frank into one final talk.
you're gonna remember it for the rest of your life. All right, sweetheart?
now, no pressure. I'll give you a moment.
daddy, how do you feel?
I'm ready...
he said he's ready for the Lord's will.
I'm ready...for more pills.
more pills.
we're out of oxys, but I have a dealer coming with liquid morphine. Okay?
well, I was thinking of just, like, a bouquet, and then a boutonniere for the groom, and just maybe a centerpiece.
Oh, roses. That would be really nice.
Yeah, can you get me a quote on that?
okay, thank you.
what do you think? I had it altered.
and I asked Chuckie if he wanted to be the ring bearer, and he said yes.
and I think he's excited. Although...
it's kind of hard to tell with him.
Frank isn't gonna make it to your wedding.
it was a lovely idea, but what he needs now is just to die in peace.
can you stop saying that?
letting go can be a beautiful thing.
you know what? I'm kind of excited about my marriage, and you're kind of being a downer with this whole "Your fiance's gonna die" thing.
so I made him a liver cleanse.
it's got egg whites and pickle juice.
I saw it on Dr. Oz.
anyway, it's really, really good for the electrolytes.
he can't swallow.
this isn't about me.
this is about five American Indian children who have no parents, who cannot become part of this family unless Frank and I are married.
now, the tribal council is in six days, and if Frank wants to die after that, it's up to him.
now, I'll be giving him his cleanse.
all right, that's it. Just rest before the next contraction.
you are doing amazing, honey. - How would you know?
because you're making all the right sounds.
remember that birthing video with the chick making all the buffalo noises?
you're totally making those noises.
Where's Fiona? - I left a message.
she can't leave the house before 8: 00, right? She's probably on her way.
would you like to stand around here with us?
no, I'm good. - You don't want to watch?
honey, I was over there earlier, and I saw some hardcore shit, like, horror movie shit.
no, I'm gonna stay with you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
God, I am so sorry I can't help. I'm useless at this.
you know, Tommy says that in some cultures men aren't even allowed near the birth, just a bunch of women in tents, which makes sense, because I would be so much more useful if I was out hunting moose or something.
shut up, shut the fuck up, Kevin.
please shut the fuck up. - Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, Mandy still asleep? - In Lip's room.
what are you eating, pancakes? What fucking time did you get up?
about 5: 00.
you didn't get back from work until 3: 00.
Yeah, I went for a run this morning. I have a ton of energy.
Oh! Check out this sunrise.
look at that. It's crazy.
Yeah, that's real nice.
must really clear your mind watching a sunrise after a long night of gargling old man balls.
pancakes are on me. - Thought you were broke.
Nah, man, I just got a baby mama with her fucking hand in my pocket.
I mention Kev is charging rent for the rub 'n' tug?
how's that for bullshit?
Fiona never came home. She violated probation.
she's not in her room?
I checked last night, again this morning.
back to the metal motel. - I called Sheila.
she's not there, and she's not at the hospital with Kev and V...
the hospital? - V's having her babies.
she is?
Fiona would not miss her curfew on purpose.
what if she got mugged or fell in front of the El?
she's probably fine, Debs. Maybe she got permission to go out.
you don't think we should call the police?
no, that'll just make shit worse. - Well, then what do we do?
will someone at least call hospitals while I'm at school?
I'm on it.
Ugh, I lost the shiv Carl made for me. Melted toothbrush, duct tape handle...
why do you need a shiv?
in case I run into my ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend.
what...what happened to you?
kenyatta happened.
I'm over it, okay? Let's move on.
I told Mickey she could stay here. And you're not going back, by the way.
we'll find you someplace to live, okay?
fuck should she leave? It's our house.
why are you making such a big deal about it?
Jesus. - I have to go.
are you calling hospitals? - Yep.
sorry. Doing it now.
Oh, there it is.
that a shiv? - Yep. Later.
13 years old, she's bringing a shiv to class.
man, I miss high school.
Hey. Hey, little man.
how'd it go?
I finished early, double-checked my answers. Who the hell knows?
you don't look happy.
well, Debbie texted, and, uh, Fiona didn't come home last night.
and since she's under house arrest, that's kind of a problem.
Ouch. But there's not really anything you can do, is there?
uh, make some calls, uh, try to figure out where she is, uh...yeah, I don't really know what we can do.
well, are you able to stay focused your exams?
Yes, I am focused.
what's this? - A laminated schedule of your midterms and a sliding scale of the scores you need to get a B and keep your scholarship.
holy shit.
well, I'll see you tonight. Maybe we'll 69.
uh, look, can he hear us?
Hey, Kuzner, you hear what I said to Lip about sitting on his face while I bob for knob?
he can't hear us.
um, okay, I'll catch you later, yeah?
I can hear.
Oh, sweetie, that's...that's candy for the gift bags for the wedding.
can I have candy?
sweetie, let mommy do her drug deal, honey.
we got Vicodin... - Uh-huh?
Dilaudid, and Duragesic.
liquid morphine? - Two hundred.
oxys? - 20 each.
codeine? Dad's liver's failing. He's in a lot of pain.
that's gonna cost about 25 grand.
for codeine? - For a new liver.
What...Isn't that what you just said?
wait, wait. I'm confused. You do liver transplants?
no. No, no, no. But I know a guy.
kind of works on the down-low.
I-I-I wa...I wa...I'm sorry.
I was just eavesdropping. - Mm-hmm?
did you just say that you do a liver and a transplant for $25, 000?
sure, last I checked.
but you do have medical records, right?
my boy needs that to find a match.
we can buy Frank a liver!
give us a second.
I have...a little money saved. - Yeah.
and you had to have made some money from selling off my furniture.
I mean, that was covered in plastic...
okay. - And pristine.
okay, but before we get too excited, a transplant...
that's a major medical procedure. - Yes.
this guy is a dealer I met in a parking lot after a Phish concert.
okay.
did he sell you bad drugs? - No.
he's a pear farmer. - What?
Avery, our friend in Wisconsin.
his farm is totally organic.
compost, natural bug repellent.
we all take shifts, and during harvest season, we...
dude, what, uh, what is this?
huh? Is this an ankle monitor? - Hers.
huh? What?
it's beeping, dude.
that means the cops are gonna come looking for it.
so why are you still holding it? - Chuck it outside.
do you think it's got GPS?
at night, you look up and can see the Milky Way, and it's all white and... milky, hey-hey.
Hey.
Hey, how about that ecstasy?
no, thanks.
you already took it.
it feels nice, right?
you were quiet today in detention.
I don't really want to talk about it.
okay.
my dad's dying.
is that a good thing or a bad thing? - Mostly bad.
well, let's do something to take your mind off of it.
like what?
this is a '99 Ford Contour.
they're pretty easy. - Are we stealing it?
just have to expose the ignition cylinder, cross some wires.
can you teach me? - Get in.
Oh, Lord. Oh, how wonderful.
ready to meet your sister nieces?
they've been asking about you.
Ooh, aren't they perfect?
the nurses just left 'em here, like we know what the fuck we're doing.
this is Amy, and that's Jemma.
Kev wanted to name her Zaniqua.
well, you know, one pseudo-African name, one normal one.
babe, check that.
no, it's just Kate saying congratulations.
well, what...what's wrong?
Fiona never showed up, and then Kev called Lip, and he said she never came home last night.
you know she's under house arrest. - Oh, that's not good.
you know, I gotta go pick up baby wipes and rash cream.
Yeah, I'll go ask around, see what's up with Fiona.
go by the Gallaghers'. Go by Sheila's.
and I'll stop by the Alibi too.
all right, now, uh, tell me again.
um, this one's Amy.
uh, I think so.
I mean, I know their names. I'm just not 100% yet on which one is which.
we called these hospitals, but they all said Fiona's not a registered patient, but if she's unconscious, they wouldn't have her name.
you think she's unconscious? - No.
I don't know, just call and tell them you need to look at all the patients admitted yesterday who match Fiona's description.
I'm late for work. - I might not remember all that.
well, that's why I wrote it down.
cool, I gotta go. Bonnie's waiting.
you really think you can get to five hospitals?
she drives fast.
Hey, does this look okay?
how did you do that? - Cover-up.
living with Terry brought out the artist in me.
nice wheels. - Oh, yeah, it's Amanda's.
you know, she's sort of my, uh...I don't know.
Hey!
it's not the first time a boyfriend's beaten the crap out of me, - but it's definitely the last. - I'd hope so.
how's your boyfriend? - Mm, he's not.
sorry, I lost track.
I have too much to do to even worry out him or the girl he's seeing, so really, it's a good thing.
the first guy who even slaps you, I want you to take that shiv and jam it in his eye.
don't even let him start.
hmm, Lip told me to go for the scrotum, but the eye works too.
did anyone just see an underage girl drive off in a beater with Carl?
Yeah, that would be Bonnie. - Who the fuck's Bonnie?
Hey. What, uh, what brings you here?
she's staying with us because Kenyatta... - You can spare him the details.
it's temporary, so don't get your flowered panties in a knot.
what happened to your eye? - This.
okay. - Ah, you dropping Liam off? Hi.
Yeah, yeah, I got an exam in a few hours. Any word on Fiona?
uh, Carl and Ian are checking hospitals, but I'll try Kev again later.
no, I already talked to him. He's got nothing.
doesn't Fiona have an ankle monitor?
can't we just call the probation officer and see if they know where she is?
no, we don't want to draw their attention to the fact that she's gone AWOL.
but if she's hurt or...or kidnapped...
look, if we don't find her soon, we'll consider that option, okay?
all I do is look for my family.
I'm getting all of you ankle monitors.
what, install chips under the skin? - I'm not kidding.
so what do we do now? Here, you go, baby.
well, we wait. Hope she's okay.
Hey, will you, uh, make him some lunch? I need to study.
Yeah. Wanna go get lunch?
Thanks. - Hungry?
Ooh, no, no, no. Don't touch that.
what did you say your name was again?
I prefer not to use my real name.
if you like, you can call me "Johnny.
I'm a trained surgeon with a medical degree from Chittagong, Bangladesh.
I'm just not licensed in this country.
well, as long as you're licensed somewhere.
where will you get the liver?
I've already secured a donor based on the medical records you provided.
I have an anesthesiologist, hepatologist, surgical staff, and facilities with the necessary equipment.
but we will not oversee the patient's recovery.
after the transplant, you will take him to a hospital.
the ER will admit him at that point, regardless of how he got the liver.
when do you say you wanted to do the procedure?
as soon as possible.
O-only not tomorrow,'cause tomorrow's already pretty full.
we're getting married. - Yeah.
Oh. Congratulations. - Thank you.
the transplant will cost 25, 000 American dollars, plus 5, 000 for the liver...30, 000 in total.
Um...can you do it for 26, 000 total?
that's all we've got.
that, uh, that's what we...
we were told that...that...
I will accept this offer.
that is your liver.
Shakhawat is a perfect match.
he will give you one lobe.
thank you. That...that is so nice of you.
Thanks.
contact me at this number.
now excuse me. I have a taxi waiting.
what did you say your name was again?
Yes.
there's no sign of her.
Hey, how come none of us ever learned to play guitar?
or any instrument?
I was thinking that maybe we could pick up guitar or...or piano, or drums even, just...it...it's such a cool way to express yourself, 'cause it...there were these street musicians on Roosevelt, and they had this groove thing going, and...
that sounds really interesting, but I'm trying to read German philosophy.
okay? Which is hard enough on a good day, meaning a day when I'm not imagining Fiona dead in a ditch somewhere, so if you could just please...
sorry.
I'm sorry, Debs.
I gotta go.
just 'cause Fiona's gone doesn't mean she's hurt.
I mean, when I joined the army, I just needed to get away for a little while.
what if she's pulling a Frank? - What do you mean?
well, she went somewhere and got fucked up.
it's not like Fiona.
and what has she done this month that is like Fiona?
I mean, these past few days, she's been pretty down.
we've been kinda hard on her.
what, so it's our fault? - I didn't say that.
I've been pretty much ignoring her.
stop. Okay?
don't go down that road. If she's bottoming out, that's on her.
so we act like we're looking for Frank.
check under bridges. - Yeah, why not?
there's a drunk tank at the city jail.
who else would she get fucked up with?
what about Mike's brother, Robbie, the one who gave her the coke?
Yeah, you have his number?
Ian could call Worldwide Cup and say he's an old friend.
good. Good.
shit, um, look, I gotta go.
um, you know, I wish I could stay and help. I just got this exam...
Yeah, whatever, we know.
the number's in Chicago. For Worldwide Cup.
I get the couch tonight.
I was on the floor at Robbie's and what's-her-name's.
fine, I'll crash with Avery.
I'm gonna puke.
did she say she's gonna puke? - Hey, that doesn't open.
do not puke in the van, okay? - Pull over.
Yeah, but I can't pull over here. - Oh, she's...
Oh, God. - No, don't...
Bleh! - Oh, damn.
get her back in.
where are we? - In the van.
I thought you hated Avery. - Where are we going?
that was one time. I was passed out. Avery had sex with me.
where are we going? - That was not cool.
but usually, he's, like, a pretty cool guy.
okay, so where were we?
right. So let's see. Shoes.
what are you thinking here?
Open-toe...or... closed?
closed
Really?
I prefer that design for it's pared down, simple lines.
that's so interesting.
okay,'cause I think we might be on the same page here.
glossy or matte program?
hmm. Sammi.
loss... - Mm-hmm?
...is part of the cycle of life.
whatever grows must decay. - Yeah.
everything is temporary, and...and you, you, Sheila, are so brave.
thank you. Okay, what are we talking about, though?
I heard the death rattle. - Mm-hmm?
I checked his pulse.
I opened the window. And I set his spirit free.
Frank is dead.
No! No. No, he isn't. God damn it.
don't close the window! - Oh, no.
you don't want me to close the window.
his spirit... - Frank!
okay, lift the head. Tilt the chin. Check for breathing.
what are you doing? - CPR. I learned it at the Y.
Sheila, no, he's already gone.
please stop yelling. I can't hear if he's breathing.
one, two, three... - Hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Leave his body alone! This is sacred!
please let me do this! We have to... - Don't you touch...
stop! For fuck's sake.
dad? Oh, my God. - Oh, thank God.
I thought for sure he was already gone.
all right, that's it.
we are calling the taxi-driving doctor.
and we are doing this transplant...right now. - Let's do this.
you're up, mister!
and, Frank, if you die, I will be really disappointed.
Taxi...taxi...
I knew you were home.
what?
we've been ringing the bell for 20 minutes.
okay, I was asleep.
is Fiona here? - Do I know you?
those are her shoes!
would you please get Fiona? Tell her Debbie and Ian are here.
okay, just...just hold on.
what are you doing?
Oh, I tried these barbell lift exercises.
they really work your shoulders.
she was here. I-I guess she left. Because everybody left.
she left without her shoes, her coat, or her phone?
Really? - Guess so, yeah.
well, when did she leave? Did she go with anyone? Did she say where she was going?
I mean, I,maybe... - Fiona! Fiona!
Hey, hey, hey. - Don't do that.
from now on, stay away from her.
understand? - Okay.
better tell Lip.
let's go, come on.
ladies and gentlemen, announcing the latest addition to the ball family, Amy and Jemma!
Yeah, attaboy! - Proud papa.
boom. - Cigarettes?
you know how much cigarettes are with tax?
what cigars used to be. - What about drinks?
uh... drinks for everyone. - Yeah! Attaboy.
Thanks! - Nice.
one each, half off, well drinks only.
imagine if he had triplets. - We'd get free ice.
Yeah, yeah, well, I got a lot of baby-related expenses.
Paco, what the fuck is this?
talk to your business partner.
Yeah, come again.
Hey, can you tell these girls to show a little skin, for Christ's sake?
they're not climbing Everest. They're climbing dick.
is cold. - There's heat.
downstairs. - And heat rises.
it comes up through the floor. Look at this.
unless you're planning on banging Eskimos?
Mickey, the day my babies are born, you steal cash from the register?
Yeah, your register. My cash.
I'm not the only sap that gets saddled with a kid around here.
why the fuck are you wearing clothes?
how is it your cash? - 'Cause you still owe me from last week.
plus now there's a finder's fee.
a what? - Finder's fee.
you're gonna charge for rent, I'm gonna charge for whores, 20%.
bullshit. - No.
it's like, uh, what is it?
Kelly girls. - Kelly girls.
instead of Kelly, it's Mickey. Instead of girls, it's whores.
empty your fucking pockets.
are you robbing me with my own fucking gun?
call it what you want. Empty your fucking pockets.
you better do yourself a favor and put a bullet in my chest, 'cause if you don't, you're in serious shit.
pockets. Now.
big mistake.
now, excuse me while I go to Wal-Mart and get baby wipes and rash cream.
he's a fucking dead man.
no?
sorry. So where to next?
that was the last hospital.
want to just drive around, then? - Sure.
who taught you to jack cars? - My dad.
is he cool? - Not really.
he's doing time for robbing ATMs. He won't be out till I'm 30.
when did you last talk to him? - Four years ago.
What'd you say? - What do you mean?
like, what was the last thing you said to him?
I was at home, and he told me to wring out the sponge when I was done with it, and I said okay.
that's it?
didn't know it was gonna be the last time.
how'd he steal ATMs? - Wanna see?
Hello? Hello?
Dr. Johnny? Hello?
Oh, Dr. Johnny. - You have money?
Yes. Enjoy.
Yeah, Sammy's bringing Frank down.
we should be ready soon.
Oh. Oh, God. - No, madam...no, no, madam.
don't touch. No, madam, you...you have seat.
you have seat. - All right.
food MARE
Reatroom Outside
shit. Hey!
fuck.
fuck.
we will make a slanting incision across the abdomen here, separate the diseased liver from the surrounding organs, clamp off arteries and veins...
fuck this!
I change my mind!
I don't care how much money!
I don't care... how much... money...
I'm sorry, what was I saying?
Oh, God, something about arteries and...
the operation will take six hours.
when we're finished, you will call 911 and take the patient to the ER.
it's time. - Good luck, daddy.
we love you. - Yeah, you can do this, Frank!
please, wait outside.
no no no no no, this is sterile. Go around. Go around.
around. Scalpel.
forget the ATM! They're heavy and really hard to open.
but I thought you... - Just help me grab some candy.
just candy?
Yeah, um, grab those cupcakes, and get chocolate milk.
how many cartons? - As much as you can carry.
you're fun. You know that?
Yeah. You too.
we should go.
miss, it's cold out.
I don't think you want to sit outside like this.
did...did you drive here?
some... people drove me, but they left.
is there anyone I can call, someone to come and get you?
unknow
and that's...that's my cell number.
here's your sister.
Hi, Lip.
uh, it's Fiona.
I'm at a gas station, uh, in Sheboygan.
I'm sorry.
I fucked up.
I hurt our brother, and I...fucking broke probation now.
you're juggling so many things, and I am just fucking up.
but I need some help now. Okay?
so the nice man gave you the number.
okay.
Thanks. - Here.
let's get you inside.
I am pleased to say the operation was a success.
wonderful!
he's unconscious but breathing. - Okay.
please wait ten minutes before calling 911, as we don't want to be here when the EMTs arrive.
it would be very hard to explain.
well, uh, good luck. - Okay.
Oh, we did it, Frank! You're gonna be okay!
I'm calling 911 now.
this is all I got for blankets.
Hey, do you want some coffee? At...at least it's warm.
this is Ray.
he asked,"Where the fuck is Sheboygan?
Kev is a friend. - Yeah.
you know, when someone robs me with my own fucking gun, they're not my friend.
I'm kinda funny like that. - So what are you gonna do?
you're gonna go to his house, beat the shit out of him?
no, I'm gonna go to my house.
I'm gonna meet up with my brothers, grab some fucking assault rifles.
then I'm going to his house.
Fiona's in Wisconsin.
Yeah, Lip sent us the same text too, stupid.
why is she in Wisconsin? - I don't know.
lip said he'd call when he got there. - Told you she was okay.
I'm not letting you do this. - Yeah, okay, tough guy.
Oh, Mickey, come the fuck on.
you know Frank's dying. - He's been dying for years.
I've got a sweet set of wheels out front. You want a ride to school?
no, thanks. Bye.
fine, ride the bus with all the other losers, and eat my dust.
Hey! You got visitors.
least that wasn't suspicious.
uh, hey-hey, well, he's very shy.
good morning. - Hi.
I'm Officer Johnson. This is Officer Kandage.
is Fiona Gallagher here? - Uh, not at the moment.
where is she? - I think she's out looking for a job.
when was the last time she was home?
last night? I'm not sure.
hmm, well, Officer Kandage and I are gonna do a little walk-through.
just take a few minutes, and we'll be out of your...
what's this? - I use it for knitting.
heart rate 63 and fluctuating. BP 90 over 55.
how are you feeling, Frank?
do you know his blood type? - O positive. Same as me.
uh, daughter says he recently had a liver transplant.
how recent? - I-I don't know. What would you say? About...
it was, like, 20 minutes ago? - Uh-huh.
what was 20 minutes ago? - The transplant.
dispatch, hold on. What transplant facility?
it's just in that basement there.
get in. A basement.
Chuckie, want to ride in the ambulance?
no, not a hospital basement. Like, a warehouse.
this is exciting.
okay, we're gonna lay you down. Okay?
okay.
God damn it.
it's the second time I tripped over this play mat.
can we put it somewhere else, please?
you think I could feed them both at once?
I'd like to see you try.
the doctor said I couldn't have a baby. Now I'm gonna be a milk machine.
you better say good-bye to these titties,'cause they'll never be the same again.
Oh, do not say that.
all right, we're gonna put your little changing mat over here.
Hey, kiddo. You expecting someone?
no, I was just trying to remember if I left anything in the truck.
all right.
who's ready for the diaper assembly line, huh?
I think you are. I think I have you all set.
I'm gonna get you all set.
okay, shh, shh.
don't pee pee on mommy.
Hey.
you know, I've never been to Sheboygan before.
it's nice, right? - Yeah, it's got kind of a rural charm.
come here.
I'm so sorry. - It's okay.
it's okay. - I'm sorry.
it's okay.
I'm just glad you're all right.
you know, I'm really, really fucking glad.
all right, sis, you wanna...wanna get out of here?
Yeah, okay. Come on.
here you go.
okay?
all right.
his condition is critical. Vital signs unstable.
we may have to put him on a ventilator. We'll see.
we also did X-rays.
now, you told admitting that he'd had a liver transplant?
Yes. - No.
afraid that's not true. - What?
same old liver in there.
he has, however, undergone a major surgery.
he's had a kidney removed.
they stole his goddamn kidney? - No!
no, no! No!
the incision for a liver transplant would be here.
you may have noticed that Frank's incision is down here.
Oh, God.
how long does he have?
no way to be sure, but...days?
maybe hours. I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm...I am so sorry, Frank.
we just...we just tried everything.
Frank, I-I have a favor to ask.
you know how we were supposed to be married today?
I know you're not feeling so hot, and this isn't the setting we'd pictured, but I was wondering if you would want to marry me here in the hospital.
so, I don't know, if you like the idea, maybe you could give me a sign or something?
Oh, Frank. You're the sweetest man in the whole world.
I'll let everyone know.
he said he couldn't be more thrilled.
Oh, my God. - Oh, my goodness.
yeah?
More...pills.
my family lives in there. - The supermarket?
no. - Oh,'cause that would suck.
in the van.
Oh, yeah. That's cool. Van.
we move it twice a day,'cause if we get towed, we're screwed.
are those your brothers and sisters?
four of them. Three more in the van. Wanna meet them?
okay.
mom. This is Earl. I told you about him.
the...the candy?
they love the candy. Say thank you. - Thank you.
I got the late shift, and I'll probably crash at Billy's.
Jamie's got the keys, okay? Bye.
so, you want a tour?
of the van? Yeah, okay. Wait. Hold on.
what's wrong? - My dad's gonna die.
and he's getting married. Do you want to come?
Yeah.
if you just talk to him, I'm sure you could work something out.
Yeah, he's gonna work something out, all right...
work it out with an AR-15 to his fucking head.
that's how I like to negotiate.
the fuck is this? - You guys hungry?
that a yes? - The fuck are you doing with him?
having lunch. - With this piece of shit?
you wanted him dead yesterday. - Psh, don't be dramatic.
Mandy, he hit you. In the face.
no, he didn't.
Seriously? - No, he didn't.
I just said that 'cause I was angry, and I was shitfaced. I fell.
you fell. Yeah, okay.
all right, then, clumsy feet. Enjoy your fucking spaghetti.
I'm gonna get you out of here right now.
I promised I was gonna get you someplace safe, away from him, okay?
Hey, let go. - Listen, you can't stand for this, all right?
Let...let go! - You said you weren't gonna stand for this...come on!
Mandy...What the fuck?
Hey! Easy! Easy!
look at me. We're cool.
everything's cool.
we're leaving. Let's go.
Hey. What the fuck's going on with you, huh?
one minute, you're like Superman, running around, making pancakes, taking pictures of the goddamn sunrise.
the next thing, you wanna cut somebody's throat.
you smoking meth or something?
Yeah, please, check your phone. I'll just yell at the fucking wall.
it's Frank.
here you go.
you didn't get anything? - Uh, no, I got coffee.
please eat something, though.
I know I don't need to tell you this, but you look fucking terrible.
I don't want to be another Frank or Monica.
nobody's saying that you are. - I'm not fishing for a pep talk. I just...
I don't know who I am anymore.
I mean, since clearly I'm not the big sister taking care of everyone.
maybe that's good.
how?
Well,'cause there's more to you than that.
Yeah. Fiona the criminal.
I'm serious. You know, you've always been there for us.
and I think we've taken it for granted. You know, I know I have.
and then you're going through some shit, and I turn my back.
it's...it's bullshit.
I'm sorry.
Hey, Debs.
Yeah, she's in the car.
she's eating an egg sandwich.
she's okay? - Yeah, she's fine.
put her on. - Okay.
Hi, Debs. Sorry I freaked everyone out.
Oh, it's so good to hear your voice.
you too. I'm coming home.
I love you. - I love you too.
Oh, and tell Lip that Frank's dying and getting married to Sheila, so we're going to the hospital, okay? I'll see you at home. Drive safe.
Wha...Okay. - Bye.
I'm trying, I'm trying.
V, V,isn't it supposed to go under the arm, and then over?
isn't that what I just did? - I don't know.
the nurse made it look so easy. - Yeah, but she did it so fast.
that's why we didn't learn it. - Okay.
let's try it again. Work with me.
I'm gonna get it right. I promise. I know. I got it.
I got it. - Text from Debbie. Fiona's safe.
she is? Really? Read it to me. What does it say?
Fiona's safe. - Little short on detail.
what is that?
what are you doing?
everything's fine. You three just stay here. I got this.
I'll be right back. - Hell, no! Where did you get that? Put that back. Kevin!
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
we need quiet here! What the fuck are you...Get outta here!
little assholes.
holy fuck. Sweetheart? Tell me I didn't shoot anyone.
I didn't shoot anyone, right? We're all okay?
holy fuck.
do not come near my babies. Is that a bullet hole?
I am so sorry. - Kevin, I'm not kidding.
I am so fucking sorry. - Do not come near me.
I swear, I'm gonna get rid of all the guns, okay?
I'm so sorry.
no more guns? - No more guns.
no more guns. - Oh, God.
Hey, Frank, how's it going?
put those on.
uh, it's gonna be a cool wedding.
Congratulations. Hey, is Frank still married?
did him and Monica get a divorce? - Whatever.
I just wanted to say that I love you.
and that I forgive you for everything.
unless you live. And then...and then I'm still pissed off.
I don't really know any cool last words, but I don't want you to die, and I know you don't either.
so if these are last words, screw it.
I like that.
to succeed, every marriage must surmount great obstacles...
just usually not this early on.
but as we now see, it is not the stained-glass windows of a church that make a wedding.
it is the two loving people who stand...and lie...before us.
excuse me.
last time I was here, I thought I was so different from everyone else waiting.
in my office ensemble.
now I fit right in.
I know you have to study. I'll call you when I know what's happening.
I can study here.
Sheila, do you promise to love and cherish Frank in sickness and...
uh, I guess just in sickness, till death do you part?
I do.
uh, and we'll assume Frank feels the same.
he does.
Frank and Sheila, it is my honor to declare you man and wife.
you may kiss the groom.
move! I need everybody to move!
back up, please. Move away. - Step back.
I need everyone to step back. - What?
get out of the way. - What's going on?
move away from the bed. - Is he dead?
he's in serious condition, so they moved him up the waiting list.
what does that mean? - He's getting a liver.
what?
so. You want to go first?
well, I don't have time to tell you. I'm busy.
what's your dad gonna do when he gets out of jail and I tell him you spend all day with orange boy rubbing your dicks together?
$500 tomorrow, or I call him.
the day my babies are born, you steal cash from the register?
Yeah, your register, my cash.
empty your fucking pockets.
he's a fucking dead man.
well, hello. Roger Running Tree and I broke up.
but the children, Frank.
Roger and I... we were gonna get married and adopt them before he showed his true colors.
all I need is a marriage certificate.
Frank, will you marry me?
it is my honor to declare you man and wife. You may kiss the groom.
he's in serious condition, so they moved him up the waiting list.
what does that mean? - He's getting a liver.
need you to meet my mom and dad for parents' weekend.
pretend we're together. - Just clean up for a dinner?
no, no cleanup. I need to scare the living shit out of them.
those your brothers and sisters?
four of them, three more in the van. My family lives in there.
in the supermarket? - No, in the van.
Hey, Matthew. - What does she have that I don't?
Hello? - You don't know who you messed with, skank.
I don't give a shit if you're ten years old and playing with dolls.
you want a war, you got it.
Fiona never came home. She violated probation.
Hi, Lip. I'm sorry. I fucked up.
you're juggling so many things, and I am just fucking up.
I need some help now.
so you want to go first?
where are we going?
looks like Decatur Correctional.
how far away is that? - Three hours or so.
what? - Hope you peed.
why do they nab you for? - Huh?
why you on this bus? It ain't a sightseeing tour.
I, uh...I broke probation.
I stabbed my boyfriend's wife in the stomach a little bit.
bitch claimed she was pregnant.
knew she was full of shit and was saying it to hold on to him.
had to prove her wrong, right?
turns out she wasn't lying. Oops.
Hey, pops. How you feeling?
you are looking better today.
say hi to your grandpa, Chuckie.
can he hear us? - Of course he can.
that's the only way he's gonna wake up.
when we tell him how we feel, it seeps into his subconscious, it tickles his brain, and it'll make him open his eyes soon, okay?
come on. - Okay.
Hi, grandpa. Mama says we can go to Ruby Tuesday's when you wake up.
Hi. - Good morning.
I'm Emily. I need a new heart.
Oh, I'm so sorry. - What's wrong with yours?
Hey, don't be rude. - Oh, my God.
don't you "Oh, my God" me, mister.
this is my son, Chuckie. I'm Sammi.
I'm Wendy, her mom.
she, uh...she has got cardiomyopathy.
my heart muscle doesn't pump enough blood into the rest of my body.
is that why you look like a vampire?
Hey, Charles Nevins Slott, you stop that right now. Apologize.
I'm sorry. - We are so sorry.
Oh, God. - It's okay. It's okay.
is Mr. Gallagher your father?
sure is. - I don't have a father.
Emily. - He left when I got sick.
mama says that men can't handle tragedy, so they leave.
not everybody needs to hear our dirty laundry, Emily.
no, don't worry about us. We have the dirtiest laundry in Chicago.
is Mr. Gallagher waiting for a heart too?
he was waiting for a liver, and then he had a transplant the other day, and now he is getting all better.
that's fantastic news.
see, Emily? We're in the right place.
Mickey your boyfriend?
we hang out.
he's in your bed. - Yeah, his family is a nightmare.
think I got a girlfriend. - Oh, yeah?
Yeah, her family's a nightmare too. - Whose isn't?
you love Mickey? - I like how he smells.
what you asking stupid fucking questions for?
you were nicer when you were asleep.
Frank survived his liver transplant, in case you were wondering.
Nope. Wasn't.
I got to go over to the church for the christening today.
thought you didn't care. - I don't.
why are you going, then? - It's my son, man.
all right, I'll get dressed.
no, no, look, it's fine.
I'll head over by myself. I'll be back in a couple hours.
what, you don't want me to go?
probably best if you don't, tough guy.
Yeah, for you, maybe.
why you busting my balls, man?
just wondering if we're a couple or not.
of course we are. - A couple that hides?
Hey, it's working out so far, so good.
getting kind of sick of it.
Jesus Christ, man.
how about you let me go deal with that stupid shit before I deal with your stupid shit?
Hey.
how was work, dear?
I got, uh, matching war wounds. - Ouch.
what are you doing?
looking up your quarter grades. They haven't posted yet.
all right, good. I don't want to know. I'm too stressed to deal right now.
the way I see it, you need a B average to keep your scholarship.
and I don't want to talk about it either.
I bet you'll get a B in Macro and Philosophy and an A in Power Engineering and English.
what do I have to do to get you to shut up?
well, maybe if I had something else to occupy my mouth.
that's a much better idea.
all right.
wait. Don't. - Why?
levels the playing field.
I'm on my knees. You're wearing a hairnet.
you're a freak. - Takes one to know one.
Oh, hey, look, um,
I'm not gonna be able to have dinner with your parents tonight, okay?
no, you could keep doing what you were doing while we're talking... Ow, fuck!
why won't you be able to go, hmm?
you said you would go. You're... you're going.
no, look, I-I got to... I got to go home.
I got to figure shit out, see how we're gonna pay the bills for the next 90 days while Fiona's in prison.
we made a deal.
Yeah, that was before my sister went on a bender.
you promised to help terrorize my parents in exchange for me giving you stuff.
okay, then how about we get lunch tomorrow?
no, they're leaving for Miami in the morning. A-a deal's a deal.
you're obviously not hearing me.
and you're obviously not a man of your word.
I would totally hook up with Mr. George. He's foxy.
but he's married. - And old.
this is just our fantasy teacher list.
it doesn't mean it's gonna happen.
Ugh, that smell is gonna make me gag.
do we really have to do this stupid biology lab?
there's Henry McNally.
he's so bang-tastic.
I want to suck him like a slushes.
he makes my loins roar with hunger.
Hey, Debbie, how's it going?
me? - Her?
Yeah, I can help you with your lab if you want.
you know my name?
Yeah.
the monkey said to his sister,"I don't want to buy bananas from that man.
knock, knock.
visitors.
good morning. - Hey, Sheila.
Hi. - Hi.
look who's here. - Oh, my God.
I got some special treats.
very nice. - A little care package.
how's the patient?
well, he still hasn't woken up yet.
Frank, where are you?
Frank, it's me, Sheila.
come out, come out, wherever you are.
you have got to wake up.
you see, you have some husband"s duties to attend to.
whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't be up there.
you're gonna knock out his IV tubes out.
come on. - No, I'm not.
the nurses and doctors are doing everything they can, and you just need to let him rest.
you know what? He's been resting.
okay, so can you get down? - I'm trying to get him up, for God sake.
listen, these are his soon-to-be children, and I'm his wife.
so just take a breather, miss. - Uh-huh.
isn't that right, guys?
Right-o.
we could do a Native American Indian tribal dance to wake him, Mama Sheila.
what's that?
we learned about it in our cultural history class at school.
I wish I could go to school.
mind your manners, Emily. I-I'm so sorry. She didn't mean to eavesdrop.
it's just... it's hard not to in this place.
of course.
Hi, I'm... I'm Wendy. This is my daughter, Emily.
Hi. - Hi.
I'm... I'm Sheila. I'm... I'm Frank's wife.
and... and these are his children.
uh...I'm not related to them.
well, anyway, why don't you show us your tribal dance?
that sounds wonderful, doesn't it? - Mm-hmm.
or we could just let him rest, like he's supposed to.
I think the dance is a wonderful idea.
so do I.
we're gonna go get frozen yogurt.
okay. All right.
you know where to go?
yo. Dad in there yet?
uncle Ronnie went to get him. Should be here any minute.
that thing looks like shit. - Been used a lot.
is that Terry?
no. It's my piece-of-shit husband.
this hasn't even started yet? - You're late.
all right, well, I'm here now. Let's get this show on the road, all right?
no, we must wait until your father gets here.
he doesn't give a shit about the ceremony, trust me.
he'll be here for the after-party.
no, he gives shit. He tells me. - You talked to him?
almost every day. We've become very close.
God, that is so sick. Are you gonna start banging him again too?
uh, I'm sorry, but we have to start.
I have a funeral in 45 minutes. - Good, yes, fine. Let's go.
no, we must wait. Whole family needs to be here to witness baptism.
or what, it didn't really happen?
Oh, see? It's good we wait.
what is he doing here? - How the hell should I know?
we're... Let's get this on the road, all right?
aren't you supposed to dunk the kid in the bowl of water or something?
he's right. I must start.
fine.
father, you made a sign in the waters for baptism to end sin and begin goodness.
through this baptism, Yevgeny is cleansed from sin to a new birth to innocence by water and the Holy Spirit.
that's so cool your sister's at Decatur.
Yeah, I guess.
don't you think we have enough stuff already?
no. I have seven siblings.
I need something for all of them. Tip it a little more.
fire in the hole.
I'm gonna go visit my father in the hospital now. You want to come?
can't. Got to head back to the van.
one of the kids has bronchitis.
I need to go check on him. - You should come live with me.
I can't leave the other kids.
they can come live with us too.
okay.
Yeah, I know.
so pin his skin to the felt.
Mm-hmm. - Good job.
ema, I can't look.
this is fun. - Isn't it?
speaking of fun...my parents aren't gonna be home this weekend.
you should come over, and we can watch porn.
I downloaded Sperms Of Endearment.
I'm not really into porn. - Me either.
Yeah, it's gross, right? - Ugh.
you know, they're like,"Oh, yeah.
Oh, give it to me."Just like that. - "Oh, yeah.
Hey, um, look at this. Here's his lungs.
cool.
and here's his spleen. And...
this is his heart.
for me?
give me a fucking break.
off the bus, single line.
no talking, no pushing.
keep the line moving.
if there are four aces in a deck of cards, then the probability of your pulling an ace is 4 over 52...
or 1/13.
can I help you? - Nope.
stay right there.
you want to torture your parents?
bring them to my house for dinner tonight.
here's the address. Pass that?
we're having, uh, leftover lasagna I stole from the cafeteria.
may I continue?
don't ever say I'm not a man of my word again.
if we don't return our ace to the deck, then the probability of choosing a second ace...
jump on your right foot. Pause.
now on your left foot. Pause.
high knees.
high knees. Interesting.
I'm not sure all this woo-woo spiritual stuff is gonna help dad.
not with that attitude, it won't.
I'm having a great time. - Oh, yay!
what the hell are you guys doing?
we're waking Frank's spirit.
why don't you just do this?
what happened?
he's awake! You did it, Carl.
I'm not sure that was the best method. Dad, are you okay?
where am I, Debbie? - Debbie?
it... I'm Sammi. You're at the hospital.
what? Why?
I better get the doctor.
Where's mama going, Lip?
dude, what's wrong with you? I'm Carl.
maybe I should hit him in the nuts again...
Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
he's awake! Just like I told you.
this is good news. A lot sooner than expected.
he thinks we're different people. You screwed his brain on backwards.
Frank, do you know where you are?
you're in the Intensive Care Unit at St. Michael Hospital.
you underwent surgery a few days ago for your liver.
mama, what's he talking about?
see? What'd I tell you?
why does he think we're different people?
uh, let's go out in the hall and talk.
okay, we'll be right back. Hold on.
Mr. Gallagher is suffering from postoperative delirium.
okay, what's that?
it often happens when a patient undergoes intense surgery where a heavy dose of sedation was used.
is it... is it permanent?
uh, no. It's very common in post-op patients.
he'll be confused about time and relationships.
all you can do is be patient while he's in this altered state, but he'll be back to his old self soon.
Oh, shoot. I just moved. Is that bad?
it's the worst. Now I'm drawing a man.
what the hell does Debbie have that I don't have?
her hymen.
but look at her. He's an 11th grader. She's a redhead.
I love redheads.
good thing I didn't dye my hair last night.
is it bad that I want to kiss you right now?
uh, right here? I think we'll get in trouble.
where, then? - I don't know.
how about after basketball practice, behind the stairs in the gym basement?
okay. - Cool.
ready to see? - Yeah.
Ta-da.
no, I'm just joking.
whoa. It's really good.
Thanks. I'm glad you like it.
I do. I like it a lot.
Ah, let me get that for you.
is that enough cabbage for you?
I can make my own plate. It's fine.
no, no problem at all.
how about some corned beef?
why you being such a suck-up, huh?
you and me got a thing we got to settle.
look, I'm just trying to put everything in the past, okay?
I'm a conscientious objector now.
what the fuck does that mean?
I don't really know. Something to do with Muhammad Ali.
peace and love? - Okay, thank you. Great.
tell your boyfriend to leave.
what the fuck are you talking about?
howdy doody.
tell him to leave, or I will.
all right, fine.
look, Svetlana wants you to go.
you want me to go?
no, I don't want you to go.
but the whole thing's gonna go a lot easier if you do.
for you, maybe. What about me?
this really where you want to spend your day off?
you're here.
give me a couple hours. I'll meet you back at your place.
if you make me leave, don't come over.
why the fuck you acting like a girl, huh?
I'm sick of living a lie. Aren't you?
I'm not lying to you.
everyone else? - Who gives a shit about everybody else?
what fucking difference does it make if I lie to them?
cause... because you're not free.
Ian, what you and I have makes me free...
not what these assholes know.
look who the State of Illinois just released back into society.
daddy's home!
huh? Huh? Come on.
why don't I have a beer in my hand?
right there, huh? - Hello, honey.
look at scared little boy running to daddy. - Eat me.
Where's this grandson of mine I keep hearing about?
Hey. Here he is, pops.
let me look at the little shit.
Oh, my, my, my.
he's a cute little fucker.
Yeah. - That's grandpa.
all right, let's party!
thank you, thank you, thank you.
Oh, okay, huh?
come on.
all right.
let's take a picture for your sister, huh?
yeah? Let's try.
let's try, huh?
let's see.
all right, here we go. Ready?
smile.
that's not bad, huh?
that's pretty good.
all right.
uh, yo. Hopefully you get this.
uh, how's the pokey, huh?
you get a girlfriend yet?
don't drop the soap.
uh, we're good.
only 89 more days, okay?
hang in there. I love you.
anything you want to say?
go. - Fiona. Fifi.
good.
all right.
perfect.
okay, now you go play for a little bit, okay?
okay. - I'll make dinner.
can you take your jacket and hat off for me too?
all right. Good boy.
be right back.

I don't know. I mean, if you'll go with me.
Yeah!

we're friends of Carl.
okay, where is he?

is there something on the bottom to break my fall?
probably not.
cool.
yo, get her out of there. What are you doing?
is that your dad?
no.
who the fuck are those kids downstairs?
they live in a van. - Why is that my problem?
it's the winter.
just get rid of them, okay?
no, on second thought, they can stay. - Cool.
just till after dinner. Then they're gone.
give it! - No!
this is my remote! Get your own!
No! - Give it!
uh, play. Uh, be loud.

Yay! - All right!

Yeah, we've, uh...we've been expecting you.
I'd like to come in, please, do an inspection.
right, okay. Yeah.
um, hey, listen, is there any chance in rescheduling, you think?

Yeah. - Go get your own.

Oh, honey, I told you.
you had an accident, remember?
but the doctors made you all better.
well, then we should go.
daddy's gonna be mad we're not home to make dinner.
no, he'll understand.
sorry, folks. Visiting hours are over.
Oh, okay.

good-bye, Deb.
good-bye, my sweet, sexy man.
mom, stop. We're in public.
Oh, that's right. I forgot I'm mom.
wait till we get home.
these need to be stored properly, with caps on them.
Ah, stuff's so diluted, I mean, I doubt there's even any cleaning product left.
a locked cabinet would also work.
need a fire alarm up there, as well as a CO2 detector.
okay.
floorboard is coming up on this step.
couple of exposed nails on the one below.
Hey, uh, guys, yo! You think you could keep it down?
you told us we could do whatever we want.
now I'm telling you to keep it down.
who are these children?
uh, neighborhood kids. I'm babysitting.
six children or more is considered a day care...
okay. - ...for which you will need a license...
okay. - ...which I don't imagine you have.
uh, you... you've imagined correctly.

uh, exposed wires. Yeah, I'm on it.
now for the $24, 000 question. - Yeah.
where are the guardians of this household?
I have a Francis and Fiona Gallagher, father and sister.
Yeah, they're at work.
they put you in charge? - That's correct.
what is your relationship to this household?
my relationship to the household.
I'm the, uh...the eldest brother. I'm... I'm 19.
so, if I were to call Mr. and Miss Gallagher, I'd find them both at work?
Yeah.
Amanda's here with her parents.
this is Lip. These are my parents, Jason and Sheryl.
they're white. - I can see that.
Hi, nice to meet you.
I guess I never told you I was adopted, huh? - No.
well, they bought me from a Subic Bay whorehouse, so...
go, Navy.
Amanda, that's our private business.
uh, no, don't worry. You're right in the middle of our private affairs.
that's, uh, Wesley from the DCFS.
she's a social worker here on a surprise visit.
maybe she's your real mom. - And that's my brother Carl.
these are his friends. They live in a van.
so who's ready for dinner? - Me!
eh? Go on!
come on.
Fiona, you're awake?
are you talking to me?
what are you doing?
sleeping.
what are you doing?
not sleeping.
Oh, I'm sorry.
let's be quiet so we don't wake up Monica.
I'm sorry we left you and your brother in Washington Park last night.
the dealer gave us a sample.
I forgot you and Lip were waiting outside.
how many hours was that?
you could have frozen to death.
I promise I'm gonna be a better dad.
it's okay.
you mad at me?
no.
hey...
want me to take you to Claire's tomorrow, get your ears pierced?
okay.
I'm glad you're here with me, Fiona.
me too, daddy.
so then I pummeled their fucking face in good.
that'll teach the queers to try to rape a Milkovich in the prison, huh?
huh? - Speaking of queers.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
I thought your father should know he didn't beat all the queer out of you.
really gonna kill you this time.
keep your fucking mouth shut.
can I talk to you for a second?
you know, your life right here, right now is as good as it's ever gonna get.
you got to go get plowed all day, yeah, but you come home to a roof over your head and food in your fucking belly.
five years from now, you're gonna be a used-up, dried-up old whore, sucking guys off on the sidewalk for five bucks a pop.
I wouldn't fuck this up if I were you.
Hey.
I just wanted to let you know that I'm leaving.
okay, I'll see you back at the place.
no, don't. We're done.
what the fuck are you talking about?
I don't have any interest in being a mistress anymore.
Jesus Christ. When did you get so dramatic?
when I realized what a pussy you are.
say it again, I'm gonna kick your fucking ass. - Come on. Come on, big guy.
you think you're a tough man, huh? You're not.
you're a coward.
fuck you.
you don't understand. - Oh, I do understand.
I understand better than anyone that you're afraid of your father.
you're afraid of your wife.
you're afraid to be who you are.
well, good. Leave.
what the hell do I care, bitch?
fuck.
Hey! Excuse me!
can I get everybody's attention, please?
I just want everybody here to know I'm fucking gay.
a big old 'mo.
I just thought everybody should know that.
you happy now?
I'll fucking kill you! You son of a bitch!
been wanting to do this forever.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. I better call the cops.
Hey, hand me my phone, would you?
it's cold out here. - I don't care.
I don't either.
I heard what happened at school today.
what, your stupid girlfriend tell you?
she's not my girlfriend anymore.
I broke up with her after I saw the pictures she posted to Facebook.
you mean like these ones?
I think you look pretty.
I'm the laughingstock of the seventh and eighth grade, maybe even the ninth too.
Yeah, there are lots of posts that are "Team Debbie.
you mean like this one?
nice titties. Where's my microscope?
it'll blow over.
I thought he liked me.
he asked me to the dance.
boys are...jackasses.
he gave me a frog heart.
he what?
I suck at love.
Yeah, tell me about it. I dated Seema.
what did you like about her?
she seemed nice. - She wasn't.
Yeah, well, girls are sneaky.
they never really show you their true colors.
I was mean to her too, though.
Yeah, but you're the kid.
she's the adult. She should've known better.
I'm not a kid.
I'll take you to the dance.
Really? - Mm-hmm.
you won't be embarrassed to be seen with me?
no. No.
no, I'll be proud.
fucking faggot! Get out of my house!
you pole-smoking queer! Fuck you!
don't worry about it!
I've been staying at Ian's since you've been in the can, bitch!
guess what we've been doing, daddy!
we've been fucking! And I take it!
he gives it to me good and hard, and I fucking like it.
let me go! - Calm down, Terry.
fuck you! I suck his dick.
I fucking love it. - Get him out of here!
fuck you!
I'm gonna cut your balls in little pieces and shove them up your ass so far, you grow ball trees, you fuck.
what is your problem, Terry?
you been out for four hours, and you're already into a fight?
you're breaking your probation.
fuckers! Fuckers!
and as for you...
you're free to go.
what?
if I arrest you, it's gonna be a lot of paperwork.
keep me in the office all night.
I'd rather get home to my husband, Carlos.
me and Bonnie are finished. We're heading upstairs.
all right.
email your sister, yeah?
Oh, Lip's sister's in prison.
no way. Our auntie's in prison too.
she is? For what?
murder. She's on death row.
why... why is your sister in prison?
uh, well, the first time was for almost killing Liam here with cocaine, and, uh... and then the second time was for breaking probation and going out with the guy who gave her cocaine.
my, you... you have quite a colorful story.
that's a nice way of putting it.
you don't like your dinner?
Oh, we had a late lunch.
okay, if you don't mind, I'm just gonna...
excuse me.
um, if you're hungry. It's not very good.
so all those kids live in a van?
uh, yeah. Yeah, apparently.
and you're watching them?
well, yeah, vans are, uh, cold, you know, crowded.
most people I see are trying to dump their kids, not collect more.
you know, neighborhood's got to stick together.
there you go.
and it looks like my next surprise visit here will be in two Saturdays at 4: 00 PM.
have a good night. - Okay.
uh, I'll get that.
Hey, your grades are up.
Oh, yeah, I saw. C in English.
I'm gonna lose my scholarship and have to drop out of school.
Oh, that's too bad.
unless you got an A in Macro and Philosophy and a B in Thermodynamics.
what? Let me see that.
holy shit.
that's fantastic.
smile.
cool.
telling your sister about me?
I'm in your bed with my girlfriend, Bonnie.
stay in prison. Love, Carl.
I don't like sex.
well.
but we can still kiss and stuff if you want.
Yeah, I like this. - Me too.
this is not the environment that I want for my daughter.
Jason, what happened?
there is a child who almost ate his own feces out there.
Oh, shit, guess he didn't get enough dinner.
I'd like you to stop seeing Amanda.
it's kind of not your choice.
how much?
how much what?
Jason, don't. - Why, because you want her to be with him?
she's an adult. - Yeah, she's an adult who I'm supporting.
how much to stop dating her?
excuse me?
you know, she's not in love with you.
you do know that, right? - We're not really at that stage yet.
she's just trying to drive me crazy by going out with someone like you.
someone like me? - Yeah.
I mean, you seem like a perfectly nice kid, but Amanda's just rebelling.
well, don't blame her. You're kind of a dick.
I'm not denying that.
how about $5, 000, then?
looks like that would go pretty far in this place. - Jason.
is he serious? He's gonna pay me not to date your daughter?
how about $10, 000?
I have the cash with me.
on you, in this neighborhood?
have we got a deal?
Hey, Fiona. You hungry?
I'm gonna go get us something to eat.
Oh, God.
Ah, jeez!
so your father just offered me 10 grand to stay away from you.
Amanda, you know we love you.
did you take the money? - Uh, what do you think?
that you did. - Really?
well, did you? - Yeah.
so we're breaking up, then?
well, a deal's a deal, right?
okay, Amanda, come. We're leaving.
look, you taught me to be a man of my word.
and I was just starting to really like you.
Hey. - Hey.
10 grand? - I panicked.
I told you he gave my BMX boyfriend in high school $15, 000.
I didn't know he was gonna have the cash on him.
you should've held out.
I'd never seen that much money before.
gay, huh?
I think I broke half a fucking tooth.
Yeah, my ribs don't feel so good.
so you really came out, huh?
doesn't mean I'm gonna wear a fucking dress or anything.
nobody fucking asked you to.
though you do have really nice legs.
you're a fucking dick.
Yeah, there. That's what you get.
all right, I'm calling it.
mark the time of death, 9:05.
No!
pay some fucking attention this time.
your life's not simple, Fiona, and you're nothing like anyone I've ever met.
you make me want to enjoy my life again.
who the hell is that? -- My dad.
in my whole career, I've never seen such a spectacular display - of alcoholism.
thank you.
how much are we short? -- $18. 30.
I'm taking the PSATs for some Polish kid.
are you able to kick in, like, ten more? -- I get paid Friday.
okay, I'll figure out the rest.
I can loan you the money.
we don't need your charity.
Fiona, thanks for a night I'll never forget.
who the fuck's Tony?
I've waited a long time for last night to happen.
at least Tony's not coming here getting all in my family's business.
what the fuck is wrong, Frank?!
maybe that's what I want.
you know nothing about me. -- Then teach me!
I'm gay. -- I know.
that's for screwing my husband.
I want another baby. -- What?
I get what I want, and you can have what you want.
put the candy back, now.
fuck! -- Shit!
I like you, Fiona. You're a dirty girl, like me.
jasmine, this is Veronica. V lives next door.
Hiya, V.
we're only taking in a foster kid for a week to get the money to pay for my stupid parking tickets.
want to go over to the park, throw the ol' pigskin around?
would it be all right if my son Jonah came?
I scored you a 2, 200.
I'm an investigator for the Educational Evaluation Service.
this is the robotics lab. It is the best in the country. Come by anytime.
science just turns me on.
what are you hiding?
I left them.
your house is Frank's wet dream. Never gonna get him out.
dad. -- Son.
what are we? -- Friends.
just friends? -- Friends who like to do this.
I knew that.
it says here you can re-dedicate yourself as a virgin.
oral sex, orgy, big black strap-on dildo.
you whore!
he humiliated me!
get out!
don't ever come back!
you're out of the house.
I'm out of the house!
what do you think now, daddy? Am I still a whore?
I think I was kind of falling in love with her.
how long you been stealing cars? -- Who says I steal them?
I have to leave town. Come with me. Costa Rica, it's beautiful.
I think I might be in love with him.
scary, isn't it?
I love you. -- I want to be with you. Come with me.
won't be long now, Frank.
in a few days, she's gonna make it to the store, then the hair salon, "Alibi Room."
gonna meet your friends.
ninety-nine...
hear all those heart-warming, scumbag freeloading Frank stories.
who the hell is that? -- Friend from group.
group? -- Sex Addicts Anonymous.
gig's almost up, Daddy Frank. Time to make other plans.
one hundred!
Hey, cut it off, Ernie.
Thanks, Lieutenant.
Hey, do you mind if we drop Cami off early tomorrow?
Teresa's got inventory at Costco.
no problem.
and tell Teresa thanks for the case of dented soup.
Bye-bye, Cami.
pool's open!
Eddie goes to the corner for a pack of Lucky's, never heard from again.
goddamn City couldn't wait to stop paying him.
wasn't two weeks before the checks stopped coming.
and now what are we supposed to live off of?
Sheila's single disability check?
how does Mr. Osama Obama expect us to survive on that?
he gonna try and tase me. I hit him.
if Sheila does go to work, what's she going to make?
minimum wage... at best.
nobody's heard from Eddie? -- Not a word.
man's got no sense of responsibility.
leaving a family of three to fend for ourselves.
I got tased twice, man. -- Bullshit.
what you say?
I said bullshit!
I got tasered for like a second, I crapped myself.
there's no way you got tasered twice, fought off three cops ran away.
you calling me a liar?
at the very least, an exaggerator.
a grand says I did.
Kev, you still got that taser back there?
I'll see your grand and add nine more.
10, 000 in American legal tender says you can not get tasered twice and not soil your tighty whities, much less keep standing.
all right, shithead.
move.
do it.
do it!
again!
what?
Where's my ten grand, motherfucker?
Hey, gorgeous, more Diablos.
Oh, you think these Boy Scouts can handle that kind of heat, girls? -- No.
no, not a chance.
six more Diablos, a JB back, Ketel One up with a lime wedge, Maker's seven, and four Stellas.
haven't given up on that one yet? Every summer needs a challenge.
man's in love with his own fabulous self.
probably masturbates while he licks his reflection in the mirror.
who's that, Slutty's husband? -- Uh, no. Hal's rounder.
Hi. -- Hi.
Fi, this is my friend, David.
jasmine's told me a lot about you.
only that you're fabulous, smart, and unbelievably sexy.
and that you're home for the summer from Princeton.
I'll get us a table. -- Okay.
Princeton?
we're going out later. You want to come?
what about Hal? -- Annual Michigan fishing trip with the softball buddies.
mosquitos, bratwurst and gallons of Budweiser.
sounds pretty Brokeback to me.
come later, live a little.
that a regular thing? -- First time I've seen him.
she probably did his taxes, then did him.
kick him back, you're punching like a fag.
first round. Go to your corners.
you know you're supposed to hit him back, right?
fuck, that kid hits hard.
what did you think this was going to be?
I didn't think he could punch me with a foot.
you see that? He kicked me in the top of my goddam head.
listen, look at me. You want to throw in the towel?
round two -- I would if I was smart.
he's crazy about you.
long Island, two Landsharks, three Mojitos, Margarita no salt, Chivas neat and a Jack rocks.
all the woman needs is a pole.
why don't you come out with us later.
Kev won't mind. -- I can't. I got a shift at the nursing home in the morning.
this better be somebody who's about to give me a gigantic tip.
God, I'm so sorry. I thought your ass was my drink.
Hey, Justin Bieber.
how's things at Goldman Sachs?
going well enough for me to afford getting ripped off coming here.
and it's JP Morgan.
Oh, whatever. All you mortgage-raping shits should be in prison anyway.
Yeah, well, I was in grad school during the mortgage crisis.
nowadays, we're trying to short euros so Greece will go bankrupt.
are we on for later? -- I haven't decided if I still like you.
later, Mama Bear.
Hey, Junior, school night. In bed with the lights out by 10: 00.
what? -- Order's up.
how the hell did that little guy kick Kurt-fucking-Landis' ass?
we make anything on my fight?
Thanks, Rasmik!
Nah, nobody wanted the odds.
What'd you put down? -- On the fight you lost?
nada.
fraternal loyalty doesn't extend to stupidity, bud.
so, Mickey's out soon, yeah?
in about a week or so if he doesn't stab anybody else.
plastic fork...
barely broke the kid's skin, but it bought him another 30 days.
you got to be looking forward to having Mickey home again, huh? -- I guess.
Hey, I want to stage another fight night next week.
go around to the dojos, round up some more scrappers, all right? -- Sure.
where you going? -- Karen's.
thought you gave up on that. -- See ya.
Karen Jackson? After that thing with your dad?
I'm sneaking antibiotics into his toothpaste, just in case.
tomorrow fuckhead!
Jesus Christ!
fuck!
friend dropped me off. -- Right.
what the hell you doing here? -- Came to see Karen.
she went with a guy to her group.
what group? -- Sex Addicts Anonymous.
well, can I come in and wait? -- No.
looks like old man Dave is beating your time, Romeo.
Yeah, well, I'm working without pharmaceutical assistance.
he was popping little blue pills... I counted four.
four, wow. We could be here awhile.
Ah, fuck!
I told my boss I'd meet him for a run in about an hour.
I could run with you. I ran track in high school.
what? Don't look so surprised. I ran distance.
there was a chance I was gonna make state.
yeah? What happened?
life. Come on.
I'm fast. -- Oh, really?
I could beat your ass. -- You're on.
wait!
okay, ready? -- Give it to you.
okay. -- All right.
on your mark... -- Yeah.
get set... -- Okay.
go!
what are you doing? Are you a valet now?
see you tonight?
maybe. -- Maybe?
Hey, Fiona.
how's work? -- It's good.
how's your remodel coming?
you really want to know or just being neighborly? -- Neighborly.
cast iron plumbing's out, replacing it with copper.
guy on my shift moonlights as an electrician, so he's going to help me rewire.
you gonna flip it or live in it?
waiting to see what happens.
I got to get the kids going.
what happened to you?
one of my fighters pussied-out on me, I had to fill in.
looks like the pussy had the right idea. Get some ice on that eye.
good morning.
we're out of mac and cheese.
I can make PB&Js instead, but I'm gonna need more bread.
how many signed up for today? -- Nine.
Romano twins, Cami, Mangis, that Ulin kid with the big head.
whoa, half a cup. I'm exhausted.
Liam had me up half the night banging his head.
I need my own room.
and I want a pony for Christmas.
he's a boy, he should be in with the boys.
no way, there's three of us in that room.
I'm a girl. I'm going to be a woman soon.
I need privacy to undergo the upcoming traumatic transformation.
it's not that traumatic.
how would you know? -- Video in fifth grade.
what are we talking about? -- Moving Liam into our room.
no fucking way.
first day care kid is here.
my own room? -- It's not gonna happen, Debs. Go, go.
"Traumatic transformation"?
Ethel, the garden looks great.
it's all in the compost.
my red worms have been working overtime this year.
none of God's bounty ever needs go to waste.
still on for today?
think it still runs?
probably not, but you can fix anything.
Hey, what are those huge round green things in the back? -- Tomatoes.
she's a keeper.
Frank! Karen! Breakfast!
I moved it.
Hey! Good morning.
I, uh, I can't find my watch.
I have looked everywhere.
it's on your wrist.
I had mom move her rainy day fund after what happened last time.
Karen, the omelets are ready! -- I had nothing to do with that.
Hello?
I hid her ATM card, too, so don't even try taking that again.
her nose has been running, but I think it's just the glue that Jeff's been using on the new kitchen linoleum.
Bye, baby.
Oh, and please, no gluten.
gluten? -- Who knows.
Hey, there you go. There's Cinderella.
uh, you all set? -- Yeah.
playtime, one hour. TV or Bambi...
skip the dead mom part.
arts and crafts. Cheetos and carrot sticks.
story time, nothing scary. Free play, lunch, nap, pool, Dr. Oz, Twinkies and milk, parent pickup.
Oh, and don't wake you unless there's blood or exposed bone.
lots of blood.
who's ready for TV, guys?
okay, let's watch.
it's about time.
you see Kash last night? -- No.
he didn't come home again.
had to open the shop by myself.
homeless winos ten deep at the door trying to trade stolen recycling for 40s and Mad Dog.
uh, pack of Marlboros.
how old are you, eight? Get the hell out of here.
you handle the store by yourself? I got to get upstairs.
the twins are going to be late for swim team at the mosque.
and no free breakfast. You come to work hungry, you pay like everybody else.
Linda gone?
been waiting across the street for an hour.
late night?
what do you care?
where the hell have you been?
Kash! I waited up until after midnight. You know the doctor wants me in bed by...
what are you looking at?
go microwave me a burrito and stock the cooler.
a pack of Marlboros?
what?
Hey, you try starting this thing since last summer? -- No.
Hey, how's the crop coming?
it's almost harvest time.
but I'm a bit worried though.
it seems like there's a lot more cops in the park this summer.
Yeah, I'm working on it.
I'll go chase the rats out of the coolers.
Hey, guys.
what are you doing? -- Borrowing Liam.
Where's that, that backpack thingy?
borrowing him for what?
going to take him to the aquarium.
no, you're not, it costs too much.
okay, then, the zoo.
when are you bringing him back?
I'll bring him back when I'm damn ready.
I'm his father, we need time together.
should we wake Fiona?
see any exposed bone?
Stan's yelling again, so loud you can hear him through the floor.
Oh, yesterday it was Nixon and Jimmy Carter. What's it today?
I turned the TV up after "fucking colored people."
he keeps going downhill like this, you're going to have to call Becky.
he has his good and bad days. -- Bad days?
that's what you call trying to take out the trash naked?
he forgot his pants... it happens, all right?
I know you love the old racist bastard, but if it were my dad, I'd want to know he was going south.
it's probably time for her to think about putting him in a home.
I can't hear you.
no.
n-no, I don't want to watch my language.
I've been speaking this language for the last 50 goddamn years.
no, you listen to me, you fucking daughter of a chink whore.
Hello?
goddamn cunt, cunt, cunt.
she hung up on me.
the bitch didn't speak one word of English.
she's probably in the basement of some whorehouse in Calcutta.
a-and would you believe this shit?
what shit? -- My electric bill.
$8, 700 bucks for electricity.
you know, I've been running this bar for 40 years and I never got a bill that was even close to a grand.
all I want is for them to send me one of their taco-eating, wetback meter readers to come here and check out the fucking thing!
Nah, that's it, get me my shotgun.
I'm going to go down there and blow the cunt's head off.
can I see it... the bill? -- Yeah, here.
they must have made some mistake.
the only mistake they made was fucking with me.
all right, Stan, would you please sit down?
Stan, sit down before you blow - another ventricle.
Yeah, blow, blow.
I'm gonna take care of this, all right?
arizona's got the right idea, boy...
take 'em down to the border and throw 'em over the goddamn fence!
that's it.
LAN, cover the register.
we have a problem. We may need to sell some pot.
isn't that what we always do? -- A lot of pot.
so Ethel's been helping us out.
you know how she told you about that kick-ass worm shit she's been using - on her tomatoes? -- Yeah.
well, it worked so good, we decided to use it on this year's crop.
you know how I usually grow a couple plants to get us through the summer?
holy shit. -- Exactly.
wait, so what's the problem?
forgot about the electric bill.
we need nine grand or they're gonna shut the power off to the building.
isn't it wonderful?
Mr. Kevin is going to help all the old people who are going blind.
God bless you.
Jesus loves you.
fuck you, Frank.
Jesus... oh, shit. -- Where's my money?
okay, okay, okay, stop!
back to work.
your fly is down.
so how much do you think you've got growing down here?
I don't know, a couple hundred pounds or so.
I'm gonna start drying what I can, but that won't fetch more than a couple grand or so by Friday.
well, you know what? Maybe we could, uh, unload some of the plants?
Yeah, how much would we have to sell?
five maybe, six?
lip, who the hell around here has two grand for a plant?
I might know a guy. - V's going to kill me.
she's going to fucking kill me.
I promised her that I wouldn't sell more than three or four this year.
normally I throw a bunch of seeds around, see which looks best, thin out the rest, but this year I couldn't.
they're all so beautiful, I just... I just couldn't do it.
Where's my fucking money?
that was great last night.
you were having fun, I was having fun.
Where's my fucking money?
you were serious about that?
get me the goddamn tin snips.
I-If, if I had won, I wouldn't expect you to pay me.
take off his shoes.
but...
it's a turn of phrase, like, uh, uh, "I bet it's going to rain today.
Yeah, let me tell you something, If I don't get my fucking money, I'm cutting toes off and cauterizing with a blowtorch.
you got my panhandling cash.
60 bucks, man?
I was only out there for 45 minutes!
we'll keep the kid. Yeah, as collateral.
come back with my fucking money, you get the kid.
I-I-I'll bring you your money, but you can't keep the kid.
you can't keep Liam. I'll get you your money... we can work this out.
Oh, we just did.
no, no, no, no, no, absolutely you can't...
light it up, get him up.
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
keep Liam.
get up out of here.
I'll be back, buddy, I promise you.

and who the fuck is Bruno Mars?
may be time to give up on the 22-year-old grad students, start banging in your own decade.

I'm too old to start over now.
Hey, you got my SIM board? -- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Hey, any interest in purchasing a six- foot-tall pot plant?
chicks love an old dude with great weed.
Yeah, how much? -- Uh, a couple grand.

rigging up a GPS system that uses police frequencies for coordinates.
shows me where all the cops are in a given area at any given time.

what, trying to make sure our community is receiving its fair share of law enforcement resources? Why not?
listen, I-I got a lunch date, I got to go.
Oh, with who, David Petraeus?
no, I landed a Department of Defense grant.
Micro-robotics surveillance drone prototypes. -- Yeah?
Yeah, well, who knows if it'll work, but it'll put some government-issued pork in my pocket.

I could probably wrangle you some AP engineering or physics credits.
Ah, no, thanks.

my favorite was called Guns N' Roses.
guns N' Roses? How old is Jody?
uh, 37, I think.
you know, he laid out a blanket in the park, and we listened to his iPod, and fell asleep in each others' arms.

it's a part of this whole Sex Addicts Anonymous thing.
right, but you're a teenager. I mean, all teenagers are sex addicts.
Yeah, but I've been having sex since I was 11.
I don't know. Jody and I don't want the physical to complicate things for us.

Hey, like clockwork. How serious are you about this one?

I didn't break it.
I mean, coach thought I might be able to.

the time that you were gonna break? -- It wasn't a big deal.
come on, what was the time?
coach thought I might be able to break five minutes, 25.
who knows? Long time ago.
I bet that you could break it now.
you know what? We'll find a track, and we'll get a stopwatch.
sure.
yeah? -- I've got a table.
got the truck running? -- Yup.
we are back in the ice cream business.
how was work? -- Weird. Don't ask.
Hey, don't jerk off in there!
what the hell is this?
fuck, Lip.
it's an admissions packet.
Oh, West Point?
going through my stuff now?
Ian, you just graduated the tenth grade.
wanted to see what it would to take to get in.
what, to West Point? You're kidding me. You're actually serious about this shit?
well, I was in ROTC for two years, so, what did you think, Lip?
I don't know. I thought it was some kind of stupid, fucked-up adolescent phase.
I mean, you really want to get your ass shot off in some Stan somewhere?
"Stan"?
Yeah, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraqistan.
I guess I'm a patriot.
fuck.
don't worry. It was really discouraging.
I'd need, like, a 4. 2 GPA, a massive SAT score, and a recommendation from the President or some shit.
only thing I know I can pass for sure is the fitness test.
Oh, so, what, the army requires straight A's now to get your leg blown off in Kabul?
you really want this shit? -- Yes.
all right, then, fuck it. Let's make this shit happen.
yeah? -- Hell, yeah. President's a local boy, I can tutor you.
you're a shoo-in.
I still think it's fucking stupid.
fuck are you...
uh, get off... Get out of here. You better run.
what the fuck?
I know. Baby, I know. I got carried away.
but now what? What do you want to do?
you can't sell it. We got to get rid of it.
this isn't, got pulled over with a half joint in an ashtray pot.
this is Mexican cartel, 60 years in the federal slammer pot.
wait, wait. What are you talking about? Destroy it?
Kevin, there's a couple of tons of weed down here, and I'm black.
well, what about other electric bill?
we'll figure something out, dip into our savings, but this?
this shit's got to be mulch by tomorrow.
To-fucking-morrow.
Frank? Frank, where have you been?
I've been worried sick. You didn't come home for dinner.
I have done everything I can think of, and I still didn't make enough money today.
well, I, I have $80 in my purse.
no, that's, that's not...
well, sure.
I think I might have really screwed up this time.
it's been crazy exciting to see these cubs following their mom like this.
the Marsh Pride nursery has been so cool to watch this week.
these cubs are five weeks old now and ready to rock off to a new den.
Debbie? -- No Liam.
Frank didn't bring him back?
where the hell is he?
Where's Liam?
where is Liam?
he's at his first sleepover.
he's two!
they sleep a lot at that age.
which way?
this one?
who the fuck are you?
we want Liam back.
Liam stays. He's collateral.
then you better start shooting.
Hey, good to see you. -- Man, shut the fuck up.
how much is that?
I don't know, but we're good for it.
Gallaghers pay their debts.
now, where the hell is our brother?
okay, home sweet home.
good night, buddy, love you. -- Love you, bud.
I'm sorry, Fiona.
it's not your fault. Get some sleep, okay?
I didn't mean for that to... It was a joke, you know?
I was in the bar, I made this stupid...
I tried to make enough that I...
Ian. -- Oh, yeah.
yo, Freddie, what you got today, aluminum or plastic?
Ian, tell Kash to get his ass up here. Now, Ian.
don't worry about it.
Hey, Kash, Linda's looking for you.
can you do me a favor, Ian?
can you give me a bit of a head start?
you're leaving?
Linda's got preeclampsia.
the OB wants her in bed for the rest of her pregnancy.
I can't do it.
an hour, two, please.
what do I tell your kids?
been to bed yet?
you're not going to believe the night I had.
kids up yet?
think I may need some field hands.
we handed over all the cash that we'd made so far this summer and we still owe him, like, six grand.
that's the money that we count on to get us through the winter.
well, what was it, some kind of bet?
Oh, ten grand, you believe that?
now we'll be lucky if we can bank enough to get us to Christmas.
Yeah, hey, V, can we at least save some for the ice cream truck, you know, keep it stocked all summer?
how much is that? -- One bag should do it.
all right, but less than an ounce on the truck at one time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
sure, take a bag. It's the least we can do to thank you for your hard work.
Carl, stop pushing. And don't bite.
hold it... Babe, you got it?
all right.
all right, that it?
so they don't fall.
thank you, thank you, thank you.
peace.
thank you.
Bye, Veronica. -- Bye, baby, I'll see you later, okay?
all right, so now what?
to the dump, I guess.
seems like such a waste. -- You got any better ideas?
you looking for Karen? -- Yeah, I am.
she went to the store.
you Lip?
Jody.
nice shirt.
should about do it.
shit.
well, good afternoon, sleepyhead.
Where's breakfast?
Oh, it's way too late for breakfast.
you even missed lunch.
I'm not a short-order cook, sweetie.
so... I'm off for my walk.
108 steps today is the goal.
I might even make it to the mailbox.
there's Lucky Charms in the pantry and milk in the fridge.
okay, bye.
great looking tomatoes.
heirlooms? -- Yes, they are, Cherokee purples.
hope I can talk you out of a couple when they're ripe.
of course. It's all in the compost.
I can give you some worms to get you started.
Really? That'd be great. I was thinking I should start a garden.
you should.
I'll go change, grab a shovel.
Hey, Tony.
five minutes, 23 seconds?
be happy with anything under six.
on your mark, get set.
go!
movie stars don't like bodies washing up on their private beach.
at these prices, you wouldn't like it either.
what do we got?
early 20s.
not much decompose, but based on that and the lividity,
I'd say she's been in the water about 12 hours.
dead no more than 24.
strangled?
Yeah, I found these fibers embedded in her neck.
Plus, she was weighted down around her legs.
whoever killed her didn't want her to be found.
but the knot slipped.
killer's obviously not a Boy Scout.
anything else?
Yeah, her hair's dyed.
red's not her natural color
and you see these scars here?
breast enhancement.
it's a new procedure.
they go in through the belly button instead of the armpit.
I read it in Cosmo.
I'd say this girl's had a lot of work done.
cheek implants, maybe her nose.
it's pretty recent, too.
I'll know for sure once I get inside, but I'd say she spent bundle to look like this.
the price of beauty.
something tells me the bill was a lot steeper than she thought.
how'd the cops I. D. our victim?
caught a break on her prints.
in high school, she did an internship at her congressman's office, so they were in a federal database.
her name's Melissa Kovak.
her father's flying in from Ohio.
said she came here two years ago to be an actress.
ended up waiting tables.
does anyone ever come here to be a waitress and end up a movie star?
detectives checked out her apartment.
apparently, it's pretty bleak.
now, according to her checkbook, she could barely afford that.
anything we can use?
a headshot photographer named Garrett Blake.
Melissa had an appointment with him the day she was killed.
the cops are talking to him.
you and Madeleine talk to him again as soon as they're done.
so how does a struggling actress with no money afford all this plastic surgery?
that's got to be 30 grand worth of work easy.
sugar daddy. Maybe she was making money on the side.
find out who her doctor is.
maybe they can shed a little light on the subject.
why would you let someone cut you up just to look hot?
why are you asking me?
I'm going to go find the doctor.
you do that.
we really should do this more often.
it might be more pleasant if you stopped being mad at me.
try disappointed.
look, you did everything you could to keep me from going to New York, and now you're sorry that I didn't stay there.
Jules, I'm thrilled you're back.
it's why you're back that worries me.
don't tell me that the girl I raised to think for herself is making huge choicesbased on some stud she met last week.
hm. The girl you raised...
fine, okay, yeah, it doesn't change the fact that you are making a big, fat mistake.
dad, you don't even know Trevor.
I don't care if he's the love child of Gandhi and Mother Teresa.
you're 17.
you shouldn't be changing your life, you know, based on some boy whose name you won't remember in a couple of months.
dad, I'm sorry that I lied to you.
but I'm not sorry about the choice I made to come back.
or why I made it.
I love Trevor.
and you're just going to have to accept that.
Hey, I need a favor.
talk to me.
I need some recon on a kid named Trevor Boyd.
see if he's got a record, you know, anything in his past.
this on that girl they found in Malibu?
not exactly.
all right, so who is he?
Julie's new boyfriend.
Oh, hell no. No, no.
come on, Isaac. -No, look, you want to snoop around behind Julie's back, that's on you, okay?
last time I got between you two, I almostled in the crossfire.
Hey, she followed this guy across the country.
I don't know the first thing about him.
I can find a dozen guys who'll run this down for you.
Yeah, but you're the only guy that I would trust with something like this.
no way. I'm safer working undercover.
please.
all right, but this is the last time, okay?
Absolutely.
you know, until something else comes up.
like I told the cops,
Melissa was a real sweetheart.
here we go.
before she had her surgery?
most of these girls are beautiful when they walk in.
but it's tough out there.
these girls, they have managers and agents just pushing them, telling them that if they're just a little bit better looking they can have everything.
anyway, I don't get paid to give career advice.
I just point and shoot.
Mr. Blake, according to your statement, Melissa never showed for her last appointment.
called her cell, got her voice mail.
I figured it was the boyfriend again.
she had a boyfriend?
Rick Sethi.
I told the police about him.
weight lifter type, tattoos, bad attitude.
he showed up during a session one time, dragged her out.
when she called to reschedule, I told her I couldn't work that way.
but she came back?
Melissa knew what she wanted.
she dumped the guy.
I never saw him again.
thank you for your time.
Hey, if you ladies ever want to try modeling...
Yeah, thanks, anyway.
but our job's degrading enough.
I been through this already.
Melissa dumped me three months ago.
and how'd you take that?
she was in to all this Hollywood crap.
I guess I wasn't good enough for her.
you've got quite a record here, Rick.
a couple of assault charges...
I have a temper, so what?
I see.
another ex-girlfriend a restraining order against you.
that chick was crazy.
or maybe you've got some anger management issues.
got pissed off when Melissa Kovak dumped you for a rich guy, figured you'd teach her a lesson.
you got the wrong guy. Yeah?
do you own a boat?
do I look like the kind of guy who owns a boat?
look, I pulled double shifts all week.
after that I was with my new girlfriend, Angela.
she'll back me up.
she better.
I was mad at Melissa, okay?
but I swear to God, I didn't kill her.
you need to see this.
I had the cops try to track down the victim's plastic surgeon.
bank statements, credit cards, none of her financials link up to any doctors, so I got creative.
misdemeanor or felony?
what does every breast implant have in common?
besides a man drooling over it?
a serial number.
the M. E.'s office recorded the serial numbers on Melissa's implants.
the manufacturer says they were sold to a Dr. Neil Fuller in Beverly Hills.
nice work.
and I had you figured for more of an ass man.
I don't play favorites.
this place is incredible.
is this a doctor's office or a high-end spa?
I don't know, but I am buying whatever they sell.
Dr. Fuller can see you now.
as you know, I can't discuss confidential information about my patients.
of course, but this is a murder investigation, Dr. Fuller, so if we have to come back with uniforms and a court order, that's going to alter the tone of the conversation.
what is it that you want to know?
how did Melissa Kovak pay for her surgery?
I don't handle patient billing myself.
well, the reason we ask is that there's no record of her ever paying you a dime.
well, some of my patients pay cash.
Oh, really? Like, say if a guy is shelling out for his girlfriend's new rack, but doesn't want his wife to find the check stub?
well, that's not unprecedented.
the point is it's unclear where Melissa Kovak came up with that much money.
honestly, that's beyond the scope of my practice.
I'm focused on providing safe, effective care.
I assume you keep records of all of your cash transactions.
of course, yeah.
feel free to contact my accountant.
that's a nice boat.
how many feet? - Thirty-two.
it's a great way to relax. - Yeah, I bet.
are we almost done here?
I have some patients waiting.
we appreciate your time, Doctor.
Monique will show you out.
sometimes big organized crime cases take years...
isn't that dangerous?
well, yeah, but it comes with the job.
Monique, could we ask you a few questions?
I'm not really supposed to...
it would really help us out.
did you know Melissa Kovak?
she was sweet.
would you happen to know if she paid cash for the work she had done?
well, I'm a nurse, I don't deal with the billing.
listen, Monique,
I know this is your job.
but someone killed Melissa and if you know something, we need you to tell us.
girls come in and out of here all the time.
a lot of them aren't on the appointment book, if you know what I mean.
go on.
Melissa came in last week, really upset, demanded to see Dr. Fuller.
they went into his office.
we could hear them arguing through the wall.
what were they fighting about?
I'm not sure.
she stormed out of here and that was the last time I saw her.
well, thank you. Monique, you've been very helpful.
thank you. Thanks.
so were you flirting with her so she would talk or so she'd give you her number?
Yes.
Mr. Kovak?
I'm Sebastian Stark.
my office said you'd be out here.
I'm so sorry about your daughter.
I'm supposed to go in there and identify her.
I can have someone go in with you, if you'd like.
no.
you have, uh, do you have kids, Mr. Stark?
a daughter.
you know, if there's anything you can tell me about Melissa's life here in Los Angeles...
we didn't talk as much as I would have liked.
I mean, we used to be close, but when her mother passed...
sometimes tragedy brings people closer together.
that wasn't the case for Melissa and me.
I didn't even know she wanted to be an actress.
when she quit her job at the bank to come out here, I was totally shocked.
kids and their secrets.
did you know she had plastic surgery?
it's not uncommon for young women trying to break into the entertainment business.
I sell insurance in Ohio, Mr. Stark.
all I know about Hollywood is what I don't read in the magazines.
what I do know is that Melissa was a good girl and I loved her just the way she was.
so please...
please...
find the son of a bitch who did this.
give me something I can use.
talked to a couple more of Dr. Fuller's patients.
same story as Melissa Kovak.
lots of surgery, no money to pay for it and no sugar daddy footing the bill.
assuming he's not the charitable type, I got to figure Fuller's getting something in return for his surgery skills.
hmm, let's see-- what could beautiful young women have that a middle-aged man might want?
sex for surgery and just like that, mankind sinks to a new low.
are these girls willing to go on record?
not exactly the kind of publicity a young actress is looking for.
so Dr. Lookgood's banging his patients for boob jobs.
still, doesn't make him a killer.
way ahead of you.
I checked out his boat, which he keeps down in the Marina.
security guard says he took it out the night Melissa Kovak died.
how long was he out?
90 minutes, which is more than enough time for him to dump her body and get back.
getting warmer.
looking into the doc's finances, this guy's got more dummy corporations than Donald Trump.
keeps it sweet in the Metro Hotel in Beverly Hills.
where the elite meet to sleep around.
okay, so the guy's a scumbag.
he may even have been having an affair with our victim.
what's the motive for murder?
maybe Melissa wanted to get serious.
threatened to tell Fuller's wife about the affair.
murder's preferable to alimony.
can't say the thought never crossed my mind.
okay, I want the doctor's records on Melissa Kovak and the other girls.
how do you figure we're going to get those?
Yeah, we ask Fuller, he's just going to lawyer up.
we don't have enough for a search warrant.
not yet we don't.
what?
Oh. I'm so sorry.
it's okay, it's my fault.
no, no, no. Please, let me buy you another.
Bellini.
my pleasure.
I, uh, am Neil Fuller.
Hello, Madeleine Poe. Excuse me.
neurotic patients. I don't get much of a chance to rest.
you're that Neil Fuller.
Oh, I had no idea my reputation preceded me.
people magazine just did a story about you.
plastic surgeon to the stars.
there were other doctors profiled.
I know, but ...
Gabriella Cory says you're fantastic.
she went from an A to a double D.
Oh, sure, sure.
I remember Gabriella.
how's she doing?
very happy with the work you did.
I guess every girl thinks about that sometimes;
adding a little more up top.
it's nothing to be ashamed of.
but honestly, you don't need it.
you know, it doesn't matter.
with my salary, I couldn't afford it.
look, Madeleine...
...if this is something you're serious about, maybe we could figure something out.
Really?
such as...?
well, I keep a suite here for consultations.
why don't you come up?
spend some time together, and we'll discuss your options.
and if I did that?
you would help me with my, uh...
you take care of me...
...and I'll take care of you.
actually, you know what? I think I'll pass.
the people at work would have a field day.
da's Office is a real snake pit.
by the way, you're under arrest for solicitation.
thanks for the Bellini.
this? Entrapment, Your Honor.
my client's conduct never approached the level of solicitation.
Dr. Fuller was clearly trying to elicit sexual favors in return for plastic surgery.
no promise of payment was ever made, either in cash or services.
I have to agree, Ms. Devlin.
this is questionable.
they're just getting warmed up.
a search warrant was executed at my client's office last night, using this bogus arrest for cause.
we acted in good faith, Your Honor.
we have reason to believe Dr. Fuller is engaged in a criminal...
stop.
problem?
the search warrant is voided.
anything you found in Dr. Fuller's office is fruit of the poisonous tree, and hence, inadmissible.
your Honor...
in the mood for a fine today, Ms. Devlin?
just leaving.
how'd it go?
Oh, I'll tell you as soon as I pull Judge Fudimora's foot out of my ass.
we lost the warrant, too?
are you kidding? Our entire search is one step away from breaking and entering.
so what was the point of jamming me into that mini dress last night?
I guess a little joy in my life, not to mention your little cameo got us access to every document in Fuller's files.
files which need to find their way back to the good doctor's office before Dan Lauter gets me disbarred, thank you very much.
these are copies.
originals, copies, what's the difference?
it's all inadmissible.
Hey, if you can't deduce the crime from the evidence...
produce the evidence from the crime.
welcome to Stark's College of Legal Knowledge.
anything yet?
Yep, notice from the state medical board.
they're investigating Fuller for unethical conduct.
and guess who their star witness was going to be?
this was no lover's spat, sports fans.
Melissa Kovak was going to blow the whistle on Fuller's entire barter operation.
he'd lose his medical license.
Hey, motive.
fuller killed Melissa Kovak to keep her collagen-injected lips sealed.
you really think you can make the rent on this place?
my grandfather left me some money and I had to get out of my parent's place.
and speaking of parents...
don't you think it's a little bit weird that you've met my folks and I haven't met yours?
well, you met my mom in New York.
Yeah, but what about the infamous Sebastian Stark?
well, he's infamous for a reason.
he's in the middle of a big case right now.
did you tell him I dropped out of school?
I said you we taking a break.
how'd that go over?
don't ask.
I'm going to have to meet him sometime, right?
Why?
because I love you.
and you shouldn't have to run around behind your dad's back.
trust me, it's better.
look, you don't understand.
my dad tears people apart for a living and he really likes it.
I didn't breakany laws.
you're dating me, which is a major felony in his book.
okay, I promise.
once this case is over, I'll set something up.
if he wins, he'll be in a good mood.
and if , we'll... reschedule.
all right, well, check this out.
fuller wasn't just trading sex for surgery, he was getting paid.
phony insurance claims from medically necessary procedures.
no wonder he was afraid of a medical board investigation.
he gets sanctioned for unethical conduct, but you go to jail for insurance fraud.
I traced the check from one of Fuller's bogus holding companies.
guess who he was paying off for client referrals?
the photographer that took Melissa's headshots.
so he chats up the girls when they come in for headshots, and then points them to his pal, Dr. Fuller, who can make all their dreams come true.
fuller nails them, cuts them up, then submits a phony insurance claim.
he and Blake split the cash.
think its time our good doctor went under the knife.
my client has an airtight alibi.
just because he didn't kill Melissa Kovak, doesn't mean he didn't hire someone else to do it.
I didn't know you wrote fiction.
I had nothing to do with Melissa's death.
I cared about her.
the same way you cared about all the other girls that you surgically altered for sexual favors?
we came here in good faith.
tell us about your deal with Garrett Blake, the phony insurance claims.
no, no, we're not getting in to that.
wake up, Dan.
we got this guy on so much insurance fraud he'll be doing ass tucks up in Lompac for the next 20 years.
you got anybody willing to testify?
you want to find out?
because if you don't cooperate, my friend,
I am going to make it my mission to put you away.
I-I-I...
made some mistakes.
but I could never kill anyone.
I spent my career helping people.
Yeah, having sex with your patients is a truly selfless act.
so how about that medical board investigation?
Melissa's carrier questioned the claims.
they were threatening to revoke her coverage.
she was pretty upset.
so is this the argument your nurse overheard?
Melissa said she was going to testify.
I panicked.
went to see Garrett Blake I was hoping he could calm her down.
let me guess: he was sleeping with her, too?
no, Garrett wasn't into that.
he's a control freak.
he gets off on micromanaging everything.
he'd tell the girls exactly what they needed to do to get famous.
bigger breasts, perkier noses, right down to the millimeter.
he'd send them to me with exact instructions.
what did you do when you heard Melissa was dead?
well, I confronted Blake.
I asked him what he'd done.
he said one way or the other, the problem is solved.
I... I know I should have come forward.
I was scared.
but I did not kill Melissa.
here's the deal.
if this all checks out, he pleads guilty to insurance fraud, testifies against Blake.
what about the murder?
I don't charge him as a coconspirator.
but you're done practicing medicine.
Oh, try not to furrow your brow, it adds ten years.
trouble is, if we put the doc on the stand and he knocks it out of the park, we still don't have enough to prove that Garrett Blake killed her.
he had motive.
all the money he was making from referrals?
Melissa was gonna cut into his cash flow in a big way.
motive absent opportunity doesn't cut it.
I have Melissa Kovak's father on the line for you.
he probably just wants an update.
and I'm supposed to tell him what, that our case is being held together with Elmer's glue and good intentions?
take a message.
Ah, just the man I was looking for.
how would you like me to hand you your case on a silver platter?
is this a trick question?
I went out with the cops to check the boatyards north of Malibu.
and guess who rented a speedboat the night of the murder?
our favorite photographer, Garrett Blake.
can we make this stick?
Blake was smart enough to use an alias, but the manager I. D.'d him.
and he's a solid citizen.
motive, meet opportunity.
beautiful, beautiful-- okay, hold it right there.
beautiful.
Elena, what I want you to do is...
I want you to go real Bride of Frankenstein-- you're dead.
really need to see the speed, okay, so bring it in.
squeeze her tight around the waist.
beautiful.
Cora, what I need you to do is...I need...
trick or treat.
Hey, it's the beautiful D. A.
did you change your mind about the photo shoot?
I don't do latex, but something tells me the cops are gonna want to take some pictures of you.
you're under arrest for the murder of Melissa Kovak.
I hope you're ready for your closeup.
I said a word to anyone.
he'd make it look like I killed Melissa.
but you didn't kill her, did you, Doctor?
no, no.
I acted badly.
I took advantage of her, but...
I had nothing to do with Melissa's death.
thank you, Dr. Fuller.
smoke 'em if you got 'em.
Dr. Fuller?
do you and your wife have a prenuptial agreement?
objection, relevance.
goes to motive.
overruled.
no, we don't have a pre-nup.
so-- if Melissa Kovak were to testify against you at that medical board hearing, revealing your affair, you faced not only the loss of your medical license and criminal charges, but a potentially ruinous divorce.
I suppose so.
yes or no?
Yes.
and you cut a deal with the DA on those criminal charges, right?
objection, Your Honor. We've already covered this.
your Honor, I think the jury needs to understand this point.
make it fast, Ms. Kirbo.
in return for your testimony today, the DA's Office has agreed not to seek prison time on the insurance fraud charges. Isn't that so?
Yes.
so you are an admitted liar and thief who gets off scot-free for testifying against my client.
your Honor, she's badgering the witness.
sustained.
one final question, Dr. Fuller.
you had all the motivation in the world, to make sure that Melissa Kovak kept her mouth shut.
yet you expect us to believe that it was Mr. Blake who killed her?
it's the truth.
I see.
and we all know what an expert you are on that subject.
nothing further.
that stuff will kill you.
not after the beating our key witness just took.
death would be a step up.
Thanks, Gino. What do you got?
looks like you were right about Julia's boyfriend.
Trevor Boyd got busted two years ago, possession of cocaine.
I'm gonna need another dog.
Oh, no, no, wait a minute, wait a minute
now look, look, he was a juvenile.
he got off with probation and a stint in rehab.
who knew that dropping out of high school was gonna be the good news on this kid?
Ah, he's 16. Kids do dumb things.
I seem to remember another kid who screwed up, got a DUI.
that was completely different.
yeah? How?
you know what? Talk to me when you have your own daughter, okay?
Julie's a smart girl. You should let her figure it out.
Yeah, right. Or I could rip this kid's head off and tear his heart out through his neck.
that's the other way to go.
is the man who rented the boat from you in the courtroom, Mr. Gibbons?
Yes, that's him over there.
let the record show that Mr. Gibbons indicated the defendant, Garrett Blake.
nothing further.
do you drink, Mr. Gibbons?
objection. Relevance?
overruled.
answer the question.
sometimes.
on the day my client allegedly did business with you
what about that time?
I might have had a few beers.
and isn't it true that you were coming to the end of a 16-hour shift when you rented this boat?
Yeah, but...
so, after 16 hours on your feet, with an undetermined number of cocktails...
are you still confident that the man you rented that boat to is Mr. Blake?
it sure looks like him.
it looks like him, or it is him?
I'm pretty sure.
this man is on trial for murder, Mr. Gibbons.
he came in right before closing, rented the fastest boat I got.
I mean, I might not have been paying that much attention, but...
but yet you testified that it was Mr. Blake. Why?
the DA, Mr. Reyes
did he tell you how important your testimony would be?
Yeah. -Because according to one of your coworkers, Mr. Reyes told you that he could direct the county to shut down your business if you didn't cooperate.
he might have said something like that.
so, you agreed to testify that it was Garrett Blake who rented a boat from you, when the truth is, you really don't know who rented the boat, do you?
very eloquent, Mr. Gibbons.
nothing further.
we got a circumstantial case to begin with, and you blow it by trying to intimidate a witness?
the guy saw Blake.
he wasn't up for testifying, so I pushed a lile.
you would have done the same thing.
but the difference is I would've gotten it right.
of course you would have, because you never make a wrong move.
not when there's money on the table, never.
look, I made a call, okay? It blew up.
but if I had to do it over, I'd do the same damn thing.
the clinical definition of insanity.
you, my friend, are a loose cannon with a bad attitude.
I can live with that.
but if you can't back up the talk, Danny, you're out of here.
I wonder if Kirbo put on a case.
why should she?
we've already dug our own grave.
ms. Kirbo?
does the defense wish to present any evidence?
Yes, Your Honor.
the defense calls Garrett Blake.
why the hell is he testifying?
maybe God's throwing us a bone.
Mr. Blake, please tell the jury how you met Melissa Kovak.
she came to me for headshots about a year and a half ago.
and is this what she looked like when she came in?
no, that picture was taken after her surgery.
how about this?
Yes.
that was before she'd had her work done.
did you refer Melissa to Dr. Fuller for plastic surgery?
Yes.
he did excellent work, and he paid me five percent for all referrals.
did you know that that money came from fraudulent insurance claims?
no.
Dr. Fuller seemed so honest.
were you aware that Dr. Fuller was receiving sex from many of these young women in lieu of payment?
no.
and it makes me sick.
were you sleeping with Melissa Kovak?
absolutely not.
I would never exploit my relationship with these women.
they trust me.
and I would never violate that trust.
when did you learn what Dr. Fuller was really up to?
when Melissa agreed to testify in front of the medical board,
Dr. Fuller told me about the sex and the insurance fraud.
he told me he'd take care of Melissa.
why didn't you go to the police?
I wanted to, but he threatened to implicate me.
he told me I'd go to jail.
they're buying this guy hook, line and sinker.
I thought he was just going to reason with her.
I never thought he would kill her.
if only I'd made that call,
Melissa would still be alive today.
I'll never forgive myself.
thank you.
Mr. Stark.
your Honor, in light of the defendant's unexpected testimony, I request a recess.
denied.
speak now, or forever hold your peace.
no questions, Your Honor.
the defense rests, Your Honor.
knocking Blake off his story was your only shot.
he has the jury eating out of the palm of his hand, Jess.
I go after him, it makes him more sympathetic.
I still can't figure out why he chose to testify.
it's like Fuller said, the guy's a control freak.
you saw him reading his own lawyer the riot act in there.
he has to run the show.
sounds familiar.
all that crap about respecting women.
he convinced these girls to mutilate their bodies, and then fed them to a sexual predator for money. We still have to prove it.
let's go back over every woman this guy ever photographed.
a bottle of 18-year-old single malt says he's got something to hide.
make it Bordeaux.
done. -Mr. Stark...
...you said you'd get the guy who did this.
the trial's not over, Mr. Kovak.
first it's a doctor, then it's a photographer.
did Blake kill my daughter?
Yes, I'm certain of it.
then why can't you prove it?
a murder case is complicated...
complicated? My daughter is dead.
I thought you understood what that meant.
Mr. Kovak?
this guy has photographed over 300 women.
then we better order in again, because nobody is leaving this room until we find something we can use.
Oh, nice of you to join us.
I was going to go drinking, but I figured I'd pull our asses out of the fire instead.
going over a list of Blake's clients, I recognized a name-- Cindy Hanson.
missing person, couple years back.
they thought it was gang-related, but it didn't pan out.
I called the detective who caught it and had him run some names.
Hey, will you cut to the chase? I got court in 12 hours.
turns out, two of Blake's clients have gone missing in the last six years.
two more are dead.
were the cases ever solved?
one car accident.
that leaves one unsolved murder and two missing persons.
three red flags? There's no way that's a coincidence.
Oh, and the dead girl...
struggled M. E. found yellow silk fibers on her neck.
are you trying to tell me Garrett Blake is some kind of serial killer?
whatever he is, he's smart as hell.
girls all went missing from different jurisdictions.
he dumped the one body they found up in King's County.
that way, no one puts it together.
let me see these girls.
they could be sisters.
forget separated at birth.
try separated by death.
cross reference these names with Dr. Frankenstein's files.
doesn't this point to Fler?
he's the one who did the surgery, not Blake.
but Blake provided the road map.
and it always ended up in the same place.
Yeah. The problem is there's no way these photos come in.
they're irrelevant, not to mention prejudicial.
so, we ask for a continuance, and we find some evidence to tie them in.
we'll never get a continuance, and opardy attaches if we dismiss.
we need to get this guy right here, right now.
you better have the closing of your life tomorrow.
hope you all brought your PJs, kids, because we need to examine Blake's past
girlfriends, clients, teachers.
I don't care if you have to wake them up.
get me inside this guy's twisted head.
Garrett Blake is killing the same girl over and over and over again.
we find out why, we got him.
Mr. Stark, closing argument?
your Honor, the People request leave to present a rebuttal witness.
sidebar, Your Honor.
judge, we've been given no notice of any witnesses.
well, that's the definition of rebuttal, isn't it, Your Honor?
you don't know about it until, hey, there's something to rebut.
pretty late in the game, Mr. Stark.
well, I play all nine innings, Judge.
they opened the door.
Mr. Blake swore that he'd never hurt a woman.
I found someone who has a slightly different point of view.
I'll give you some rope, Mr. Stark; try not to hang yourself.
actually, I'll be the guy wearing the black hood.
the People call Amanda Sellers.
ms. Sellers, can you please tell the jury how you came to know the defendant, Garrett Blake?
we dated in college, UCSB.
people's exhibit F,
your Honor.
this is you and the defendant?
Yes.
how long were you together?
a year and a half.
Garrett was really sweet in the beginning.
he said I was the first real girlfriend he ever had.
did he propose marriage?
Yes.
what did you say?
I said, "Yes."
but once we got engaged everything changed.
objection. Relevance?
goes to motive, Your Honor.
get there fast, Mr. Stark.
ms. Sellers, what happened after you got engaged?
Garrett became very possessive.
he tried to control my whole life.
was he jealous?
extremely.
he'd get really angry if I even talked to other guys at school.
he said I belonged to him.
what did you do?
I tried to talk to him about it.
but he got so angry.
finally I realized it wasn't going to work out.
you broke off the engagement?
Yes.
what happened then?
he flew into a rage.
shoved me into the wall, started choking me from behind.
sidebar, Your Honor.
denied.
continue, Ms. Sellers.
I fought back.
I... was afraid he was going to kill me.
after a minute or so, he just stopped and he started crying.
he begged me to forgive him and told me that he loved me.
I just ran out of there.
and have you had any contact with Mr. Blake since?
I couldn't get away from him.
he stalked me.
he followed me around campus, put pictures of me on my windshield.
I'd get dozens of phone calls late at night.
I knew it was Garrett.
what finally happened?
I graduated and moved back to Orange County, and I didn't hear his name again until now.
ms. Sellers, what are you wearing in this picture?
it's a silk scarf.
Garrett gave it to me for my birthday.
a yellow silk scarf.
which, according to the Medical Examiner's testimony , is exactly what was used to strangle Melissa Kovak.
objection, counsel is testifying.
withdrawn.
Oh, Ms. Sellers, one last question.
what was the last thing
Garrett Blake ever said to you?
the day we graduated, he told me that he'd always love me.
and that meant he could never hurt me.
but that if it took him the rest of his life, he'd figure out a way to get back at me.
Garrett Blake is a wounded man.
he felt betrayed by the only woman he ever truly loved.
and swore he would get revenge.
but he finds he can't bring himself to hurt her.
so what does he do?
he seeks out the company of young women.
young women he can befriend, control, mold...
and then, he meets Melissa Kovak.
now, does Melissa Kovak look like his ex-fiance.Pretty close.
the hair is the wrong color.
the nose isn't quite right.
the cheeks, a little too round.
so he convinces her to get some work done.
tells her that this is the only way that she'll ever become a star, and sends her to his friend, Dr. Fuller.
now, we all know what Dr. Fuller got out of this.
but what did Garrett Blake get?
the answer is frighteningly simple.
he got back the woman of his dreams.
only this time, she wouldn't break his heart.
this time, things would be different.
Melissa Kovak came to Los Angeles to pursue her dream.A father's child was brutally murdered and it is up to all of us to deliver justice.
Garrett Blake had the motive
Amanda Sellers made that clear
opportunity, and a long-standing predilection for yellow silk scarves
the murder weapon.
of course, witnesses aren't perfect, they never are.
but we have heard testimony from source after source that leads to one inescapable conclusion.
Garrett Blake turned Melissa Kovak from this into this.
he turned Melissa into Amanda and then delivered on his promise.
he paid her back.
and now...
...It's his turn to pay.
never get used to the waiting.
Nope.
you know, I remember my first jury trial.
I was up against a pretty decent defense attorney.
kind of pompous and arrogant,but he knew how nervous I was.
so he called me while the jury was out.
probably wanted to hit on you.
actually, I think that's the one time you didn't hit on me.
you told me that, at the end of the day, you put your best cards on the table, then you put it in the jury's hands and you let it go. If I remember correctly, you lost that case.
not the point.
this guy's a bona fide psycho, Jess.
and if we don't get him today, then we open up every one of these other cases and we find a way to get him tomorrow.
and how many more girls die in the meantime?
I promised her father.
she was all he had.
you did everything you could.
uh, the jury's back.
in the matter of The People v. Garrett Michael Blake, has the jury reached a verdict?
Yes, Your Honor.
nice work, counselor.
at best, we dodged a bullet.
speaking of which...
so, I heard the good guys won.
we need to talk. -Forget about it, it was a big case, you were stressed out.
is he kidding?
are you kidding?
no, I don't need an apology.
good, because I was going to say that if you ever threaten a witness without my okay again, you're history.
you have a short memory, buddy.
I'm the guy who got the evidence to put us over the top.
who went out, found Amanda Sellers down in San Clemente in the middle of the night.
well, don't pull a muscle patting yourself on the back, pal, because that's what you're paid for.
and the next time you cut a corner and it blows up in my face, you are off the payroll.
he's good. -Outstanding.
Mr. Kovak.
I, uh, I wanted to apologize for what I said.
and also, I want to thank you.
I wish I could do more.
it's weird being a parent.
you do the best you can.You, uh...
you try to raise them right, give them roots.
next thing you know, they're all grown up and they've got their own ideas and their own lives.
and you realize you can't protect them anymore.
anyway, I've got a plane to catch.
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, Dad, um...
there's, uh, there's somebody l want you to meet.
Hi. Trevor Boyd.
nice to meet you, sir.
well, this is a surprise.
he was just dropping me off but he wanted to say hi.
well, hi.
dad, I heard you won your case.
I know that you're a little worried about Julie being in a serious relationship, especially with someone who dropped out of school and, uh...
I really don't blame you.
you know, I'd be worried about her, too.
good. Glad we see eye-to-eye on that.
dad.
truth is, I've...
screwed up a few times and got mixed up in some things that I shouldn't have.
but I love your daughter very much and I'd never do anything to hurt her.
so if there's anything you want to know about me, I'll tell you the truth.
all you've got to do is ask.
as a matter of fact, I do have a question for you.
do you like Greek food?
Yeah.
good, 'cause they have a mean souvlaki here.
bring your girlfriend.
Hey, Tony, let's make it for three, okay?
dad. Just when I think I've got you figured out.
I'm an enigma.
but I still reserve the right to kill him at any time.
sounds fair.
what does that word mean?
today, for example, it means that when an individual is charged with attempted murder, that charge must be proven beyond any reasonable doubt.
and in order to prove attempted murder, only one thing matters: intent.
now, I'm not going to lie to you.
Gordie Brock screwed up big time.
he came home drunk, he beat up his wife Deena and sent her to the hospital.
but when Deena Brock was lying on that floor unconscious, it was Gordie Brock who called for an ambulance.
it was Gordie Brock who stopped his wife from bleeding to death before help arrived.
does that make him a hero?
obviously not, but it does clearly show one thing:
while he abused his wife, he never meant to kill her.
he... never... meant... to kill her.
you can hate Gordie Brock if you want for beating his wife
I do
but when you go into that jury room, remember those six words because they go to the heart of this case.
see, you have a job, and your job is to deliver justice.
and thankfully, the prosecution has made your job easy.
two words:
not guilty.
do they always decide so fast?
well, three hours isn't my record for an acquittal, but it'll do.
you really saved my ass.
you just remember what we talked about.
got a meeting tonight.
good, okay.
you didn't just save his life, you saved mine, too.
woman: Shark strikes again.
Oh, Madam District Attorney.
I should have tried this one myself.
you know, as much as I love going head-to-head with you, Jess, it wouldn't have mattered this time.
attempted murder? Gordie Brock is headlines.
you went for the glory, you lost.
I tried to put away a wife beater.
Gordie Brock belongs in prison.
well, the jury disagreed, didn't they?
but if it's any consolation, you look really hot in that suit.
dream on. I will.
man: How you doing, Stark? Hey.
Margaret, why be a buzz kill?
suspect's in the kitchen.
GORDIE: It's my lawyer, boys.
so why not save everybody some time and money and let me go right now?
woman: It's a shame I canceled the photo shoot.
Margaret, why are you still here?
I've been asking myself that for nine long years.
well, then surely you're familiar with the phrase "cancel everything."
your clients are.
you got to get back on the horse.
now look, here's a tip, okay?
why don't you take the equestrian metaphors and shove 'em you know where?
Oh, that's nice.
why aren't you in school?
it's 4: 30 in the afternoon, Dad. Oh.
do you want more green peppers in your eggs?
not hungry.
it's 'cause you're depressed.
Hi. Hi.
Ooh, you smell.
when was the last time you took a shower?
Tuesday.
look, Dad, after the whole Deena Brock thing, it makes perfect sense for you to punish yourself out of guilt.
the white teen Oprah speaks.
Yes, well, the scars of my broken home have made me wise beyond my years.
come on, Dad, it's been a month.
I'm really worried about you.
these are good.
I'm okay. Yeah?
really. Yes, I am.
shouldn't you be getting home?
Oh, I just came by to remind you about the custody hearing.
I don't do custody, honey.
custody of me, Dad.
I turned 16 last month?
thanks for the card.
Ouch. Sorry.
now I have to decide who gets final custody, you or Mom.
that judge was a major putz.
you got a phone call.
I'm out. It's the Mayor.
said something about a ten-year audit on your city tax return.
man: Did you read Lopez this morning?
no. Aspen's still the playground for the rich and famous but L. A.'s a new hot spot to get away with murder.
you should audit his taxes.
truth is, I'm sick of the poor going to jail for jaywalking while millionaires kill each other without missing a massage.
we're starting a high profile crime unit in the DA's office to nail rich folk with fancy lawyers like you.
what's so funny?
I tell you what, Mr. Mayor.
you put ten prosecutors on a big-time case, you give 'em all the money they can spend, and I'll bury 'em alive every day of the week with a matinee on Wednesday and another on Sunday.
so you think Devlin's incompetent?
Hey, she's got great legs, but she doesn't know diddly about winning big jury trials.
that's why I'm bringing somebody from the outside to head the unit.
what schmo would take that job? Come on.
me a prosecutor? No.
come on. Why not, huh?
I eat prosecutors for breakfast.
they're my main source of fiber. Come on.
who better to shake up the DA's unit? Huh?
winning is what you do and it's what makes you the man.
and I'd consider this a personal favor.
Jessica would never go for it.
I've got a 67% approval rating.
she's got editorials screaming for her head.
she'll do what I say.
Manny, give me one good reason
I should even consider this.
I'll give you three, Hermano.
you feel bad about Deena Brock, you're sick of playing on the wrong side,
sir, she's on the phone.
Really? Come on.
let's get this over with.
let me call you back.
welcome to the District Attorney's office, Mr. Stark.
ms. Devlin.
well, this baby should get me out of a few speeding tickets.
thank you. Thank you.
do you mind telling me what the hell you're up to?
wow, look at these digs, huh?
pretty good for a city employee.
comes with a great parking spot, too.
unfortunately, some jerk has parked in it.
wow, some people have no respect, do they?
hmm, look at that. Terrible.
so, what, you think you can just waltz in here and cleanse your conscience by putting away a few felons?
Hey, the Mayor asked for me.
you know what I want, Jess?
I want us just to all be able to get along.
and I want the Rams to come back to L. A. but you know what? Not holding my breath.
you know, I made my bones humiliating this office on a daily basis but I want you to know it was never personal.
that's because for you, the legal system's just a game to be played for fun and profit.
do you mind? You know what? You make that sound like a bad thing. Maybe not for a defense lawyer, but a Deputy DA represents this city.
and generally not very well.
you are a good attorney, but the people in your office, they...
I don't know. What's the word I'm looking for?
Oh, yeah, suck.
big trials require a big gun.
Oh, please, you screwed up.
we both know that's why you're here.
Oh.
no matter how many criminals you put away,
Deena Brock's blood's still going to be on your hands.
Yeah, what about your hands, Jess?
if this office had the faintest clue how to mount an effective prosecution, the guy'd still be in jail and she'd still be alive.
well, this should be fun.
Yeah. Mardi Gras.
county of L. A. v. Jennifer Dennison.
are you joking? That's a dog. Woof.
accused is a 20-year-old singer...
Yeah, charged with second-degree murder in the death of Terrence Rourke at the Chateau Hotel.
accused claims the victim raped her and she stabbed him in self-defense.
am I supposed to be impressed?
guilty as sin, you're right, but unwinnable. Next.
all right, you listen to me.
Delgado may have forced me to hire you, but this is my office.
you prosecute the cases I choose.
okay.
what, the morgue wasn't available?
break a leg, Counselor.
I hear he bribes jurors.
zero conscience. He's scum.
he won the Frye case by getting Judge Kranepool's kid into Berkeley.
that's completely unethical.
and the conviction rate of this office is completely pathetic.
and it was Harvard, by the way.
well, it's clear you think you know me, let's see what I know about you.
richard Casey Woodland, backup QB, USC.
dad's a state senator, charming, good with a jury, weak on the facts, not a rocket scientist.
Billie Willis, smart, passionate, lets emotion cloud her judgment.
loyola Law Review.
great on paper, weak on his feet.
couldn't close a window. And of course...
take your best shot.
Raina Troy, tough, brilliant, and I used to dream of getting you on a case.
major authority problem.
a contempt citation waiting to happen.
whatever.
I rest my case.
I have a dossier on every single prosecutor in this building.
know thy enemy.
aren't we on the same side now?
no, the jury's out, isn't it?
but of course, if the dragon lady assigned you to me,
I guess you're on her hit list.
that means you're damaged goods and that means that we have something in common.
madeleine Poe. You're not on the list.
I volunteered for the unit.
well, I appreciate that, but you're not on the list.
I graduated cum laude from Stanford Law, clerked for the Ninth Circuit, and I've lead this office in convictions for the last two years.
I intend to become a defense attorney, and I'm here to learn from the best.
well, there you go, sucking up
an effective tactic. Sit.
thank you. You know, people say that "high-priced defense attorneys" beat prosecutors because it's easier to prove reasonable doubt than certain guilt.
but there's a simple explanation for why I always win and you always lose
my vastly superior abilities as a lawyer notwithstanding.
a prosecutor must conform his case to the demands of the legal system.
a defense attorney conforms the legal system to the demands of his case.
you want to win? Grab a pencil.
I live by three simple rules
my cutthroat manifesto.
these rules guide every single decision I make on every single case.
rule number one: Trial is war, second place is death.
rule number two: Truth is relative.
pick one that works.
rule number three:
in a jury trial, there are only 12 opinions that matter, and-- Ms. Troy-- yours most decidedly is not one of them.
now from this day forward, every case will be David versus Goliath.
and guess who's holding the slingshot?
now, I have some bad news, and I have some truly horrible news.
the bad news is from one of your lamer colleagues we have inherited the Dennison case.
the jury is lousy, the opposition has unlimited resources.
the truly horrible news...
we go to trial in 48 hours.
for this to work, you must accept that winning is the only thing that matters.
what about justice? Hey.
your job is to win.
justice is God's problem.
so, guys, you're either on the bus or you're off the bus.
let's get to work.
I've seen you on television.
occupational hazard.
you represent criminals.
Terry wasn't a criminal.
Mrs. Rourke...
I'm here to help you, so please tell me about your son.
Terry was a great kid.
he always loved music and photography.
shooting videos, he could do both.
did Terry have an active social life?
he dated a lot.
girls liked him.
I have to ask.
was he in the habit of having one-night stands?
do you have children, Mr. Stark?
a 16-year-old daughter.
then you know once they start to grow up, they don't always tell you everything.
maybe you don't want to know.
just pray they're safe.
I believe this girl murdered your son.
but I have to tell you, it's gonna be tough to convince a jury of that.
I understand.
but the thing is...
Terry could never have done what she said he did.
and if I'm going to find a way to go on living,
I need the world to know that.
well, then I'll have to restore your son's reputation, won't I?
and I give you my word I will.
okay, Town Car picks up Jenny Dennison at 6: 00 a. m. drops her at a Burbank soundstage.
she spends the next 15 hours shooting a music video.
Terrence Rourke was a camera man on the shoot.
they got chummy, went out for drinks and landed back at the Chateau at 2: 15 a. m.
alcohol impugns her credibility.
she asked him to leave, he refused.
he got sexually aggressive, pushed her down on the bed and raped her.
her medical exam shows no evidence of forced intercourse.
or any defensive wounds indicating a violent struggle.
well, if Rourke didn't rape her, why'd she kill him?
you're just like a guided missile, aren't you?
straight to the heart of the case.
okay... strategy.
first, we've got to implode Jenny Dennison's case.
we want the jury to say to themselves "How does a guy with no history of violence whatsoever become some mad rapist?
we got to create our own truth.
so, here's Terrence Rourke, shows up on the set, meets a cute girl, asks her out for a date, they have a few too many drinks, they get into a drunken argument,
Jenny settles it with a knife.
the existing prep work on this case is atrocious.
start over.
assignments. Madeleine
all the dirt on Jenny.
uh, boyfriends, friends, relatives.
Billie, same thing on Terrence Rourke.
raina, forensics.
the CSU and the M. E.'s reports...
are just the beginning.
be creative, dig deeper. Martin, you're gonna go to the Chateau, ask for Reid.
R-E-I-D. He's the assistant manager.
tell him I sent you and you give him this, okay?
now, check out Jenny's story, the whole crime scene.
follow in her footsteps, find the holes in the case. Let's get going.
what about me? Oh, yeah.
I want you to go down to Jensen's and get a double order of cheese fries.
you're joking, right?
did I chuckle? You're gonna bring the fries to Jurors' Bailiff Ray Sabado.
ray's in charge of the jurors on this case.
two things he loves more than life itself:
he loves yakking with the jurors and he loves to eat.
that bag of fries is gonna buy us more insight than ten jury consultants, okay?
uh, that's prosecutorial misconduct.
well, we'll just have to be brave on this one.
we have to prove that Terrence Rourke was a victim of murder.
we need to make that jury hear his voice.
woman: So how's the new job going?
I've had better days.
Larry just got himself a new gig.
head of anesthesiology.
can he put me out of my misery? He's about to.
you just wrote your last alimony check.
we're engaged.
is that for my happiness or the alimony?
Yes.
there's more.
Larry's new job is in New York.
Oh.
there's a great private school for Julie there.
the custody hearing will be over by then.
timing seems good.
what do you think?
I... I mean, you...
obviously thought this all out and...
you always seem to know what's best for Julie...
it'll be great for her.
and, hey, we always talked about moving to New York one day.
remember? Yeah, right.
but this is a slightly different version.
did you tell him?
I told him.
pretty freaky, huh? Yeah.
Yeah, pretty freaky.
but you're still gonna come visit us, right?
I mean, I know you're always swamped...
Oh, you kidding? No, I mean, hey, we'll, you know, hit the Broadway shows, we'll watch the Knicks lose.
Yeah, no, it-it...
it'll be great.
great.
Yeah.
good.
okay.
so...
we'll let you get some work done.
sweetie...
good night.
to make myself clear.
we're fighting the clock, guys.
it's only been 24 hours.
aka half the allotted time.
your stuff on the victim is thin.
and your forensics overview is like every high school class I ever failed, Raina.
you, Martin, you interviewed the room service guy but none of the maids on Jenny's floor?
and what about Bailiff Sabado?
he was sick yesterday.
and when you went to his house?
just tell me you went to his house.
he said he's contagious.
well, you better hope he dies.
I take that back. But anyway, look, the only good thing here is your stuff on Jennifer Dennison. That is good.
we need more stuff like that if we're gonna clear Terrence Rourke's name.
that's what it's gonna take to win.
that is why we're here.
okay.
Hey.
Hey, Julie.
that's my dad.
I'll call you guys later.
Hey.
is Mom okay?
why wouldn't she be?
well, why else would you be here?
I was in the neighborhood.
why, is it so bizarre for me to stop by?
you haven't visited me at school since the third grade.
so, yeah, this falls under the bizarre category.
fine, you want to grab a bite to eat?
what about your case?
Oh, the evidentiary hearing got bumped till 4: 00.
I got a couple hours, so...
are you sure Mom's okay?
you know, I thought with you leaving soon we might hang out a little bit, but if you don't want, I can eat a Power Bar...
that's not what I said.
look, the thing is, I was just headed down to Melrose.
Oh, that's good, because I need a new pair of leather chaps.
well, actually...
you ready to go?
dad, this is Jared.
Hi. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Stark.
caught the Brock trial on Court TV.
it was a killer cross on the neighbor chick.
Yeah, thanks. That didn't work out so well, as it turned out, but...
dad. Yeah.
Jared, you know, my dad and I are...
no, sweetie, it's okay. You two go.
okay, I'll see you later. Are you sure?
I'll catch you later.
good meeting you, sir. You, too.
okay, how about she's got me stuck in the damn storage closet?
I'm surprised she let you out for lunch.
foxy, what are you doing here?
he's head of my Council on Physical Fitness.
Oh, couldn't get Magic?
Oh...
you're funny.
I hear I might need to find a new lawyer.
I'll get you some names.
how about Anita Astin?
outstanding. Apparently, Defiance Records agrees.
I hear they're about to bring her in to represent Jenny Dennison.
that's not good.
she as tough as they say?
tougher.
didn't you two have a little thing?
once.
well, twice, actually.
how'd it end?
not well. Hmm.
involuntary manslaughter. Five years. She's out in two.
you run this past the DA?
it's a great deal, Jenny. Take it.
are we talking about jail-jail or Martha Stewart jail?
uh, we could work something out.
the offer's declined. You sure, Jenny?
because if you get convicted, you could die in prison.
the offer is declined.
I need to speak to Mr. Stark.
come on.
man, you like to roll the dice, don't you?
you think, what, I'm some state school prosecutor with 30 cases in the fire? You're taking a hell of a chance.
I know, but it'll be so much more fun kicking the shark's ass. Don't call me that, I hate that.
Oh, it's not like I haven't seen your fin.
Oh, you'd reject a primo deal, what, to settle an old score between us?
Oh, don't flatter yourself. I know your M. O.
you've got squat or you wouldn't be dealing.
maybe your client deserves a break.
Oh, so now you're the prosecutor with a heart?
please, you're a disgrace.
I'm sensing some hostility.
Yeah, you hopped the fence.
like being a defense attorney is something you need to rehab from.
maybe it is.
your client went bad, you melted down.
you sold out your partners, you sold out your profession, and now, Stark,
I'm gonna beat you like an African drum.
you got something big, right?
I'll see you in court.
well, maybe they found an eyewitness.
they'd have to be on the list.
new forensics? The defense hasn't hired an expert.
Oh, hey, thanks for joining us. I hired a Web monitoring service to keep us posted on all things Jenny.
well, there you go.
score one for Mr. Law Review.
and the winner is?
Oh, God, is that...?
Jenny Dennison and Terrence Rourke minutes before she killed him.
so much for Jenny being the innocent victim.
BILLIE: Now that sex is definitely consensual.
kind of hot, too. This thing's a slam-dunk.
this thing's a train wreck.
five minutes ago we had a rape defense based on weak physical evidence.
now we've got Paris Hilton 2.
some sleazy Romeo with a hidden camcorder trying to get rich off a sex tape. That's terrific.
since when is secretly taping sex punishable by murder?
since rule number three.
jury trials are not about the law, they're about what 12 people think is right.
Anita will turn that tape into rape by humiliation.
do you think winning this thing was tough before?
I mean, everyone is talking about it.
you watched it?
Yeah. I mean, it was really creepy.
one second they're going at it, and the next...
no, you're too young for that stuff, okay?
Oh, come on, Dad, that's like PG-13
compared to some of the porn floating around on the Web.
Oh, so what, now you know all about sex, is that it?
I know enough.
yeah? Enough for what?
are you asking if I'm a virgin?
no, I'm not.
cause all my friends' dads are really sphinctered out about it.
you got your mom, you got your shrink.
knowing would totally wig you out. Exactly.
look, I want you to promise me you will never be in a hotel room with a man unless A) you're married
b) I'm dead or C) both.
well, you know, there's this one really hot guy
I'm dying to go out with.
Yeah, but I don't really have a need to know that, okay? Dad, will you have dinner with me tonight?
a make-up date for the other day.
okay, but I got to warn you,
I'm not cheap and I'm not easy.
Mrs. Rourke, was your son Terrence prone to violence?
it wasn't in his nature.
but he did enjoy a reputation as something of a ladies' man, right?
you can ask any girl he ever went out with.
Terry was a gentleman.
thank you.
no further questions, Your Honor.
first, let me extend my deepest sympathy for the loss of your son.
thank you.
would you describe Terrence to be a stable young man?
Absolutely. Yet he spent three weeks in New Days treatment center in 2001.
Mrs. ROURKE: Terry, uh...
had a problem with alcohol and painkillers.
your son's records show that he was physically abusive to a nurse.
your Honor... May I finish my question?
did your son have an altercation with Nurse Gina Hathaway on August 7, 2001?
that was a misunderstanding.
objection. Hearsay.
overruled.
please answer.
she took away his journal.
and Terrence was subsequently moved to a ward with exclusively male nurses?
Yes.
you missed rehab? It was a voluntary commitment.
if I'd had more time...
Anita had one day on this case and she came up with it.
what were you thinking?
I'm sorry. I did the best I could.
you know what, it's not your fault, it's my fault.
in between writing three briefs, putting together my witness list, formulating my direct,
I should have found time to do your job, too. Look, she apologized...
do you mind? I don't need you to defend me.
there is no defense for mediocrity.
I've been up for 32 hours.
I interviewed his friends, his family, his teachers.
you want a merit badge?
in jury trials, you don't get a second chance.
your incompetence has put us in a major hole.
if I'm such a major screw-up... Mm-hmm.
...why don't you fire me?
that's the first helpful suggestion you've had.
good luck with the rest of your career.
and you are on deck.
DEVLIN: You fired her?
you don't have the authority to fire her.
gone.
see, this is a problem.
you don't play well with others.
so there's no "team"in "I."
what do you want from me?
you know what, she torpedoed my case, she got what she deserved.
listen, let me put you out of your misery.
your team can finish this up.
you can go back to your million dollar retainers, your cherry-picked cases and just forget this ever happened.
I never walk out in the middle of a movie.
Yeah, I've seen this one. You die in the end.
the hero never dies.
you're not exactly hero material.
Jess, I promised Elizabeth Rourke
I would clear her son's name.
well, you're off to a flying start.
Billie, come on. He didn't mean it.
sure he did.
the guy is a major-league head case.
technically, Devlin's the only one who can fire you.
she's not exactly one of my biggest fans.
for God's sake, just let her go.
I'm sorry if I don't join the pity party, but Stark was right-- she blew it.
Rourke's friends knew he had a drug problem and she didn't ask the right questions.
would you repeat that?
with your head so far up Stark's ass, your voice is kind of muffled.
I'm doing my job.
you should give it a try.
God, Madeleine.
we all know that you're God's gift to litigation.
you guys really don't get it.
despite your glaring deficiencies, or rather because of them, you're being given an incredible opportunity to prosecute every high-profile case in this city.
if you'd stop whining for two minutes, you'd realize there's not a lawyer in this building who wouldn't trade places with you in a heartbeat.
hello.
Yeah, okay, got it.
that was Stark.
he wants us at his place... now.
madeleine is an obnoxious, ass-kissing twit.
but she's right.
this is the chance of a lifetime.
not for me.
so did you guys take the bus here, or what?
I'm just curious.
nice place. Thank you.
you've got to be kidding me.
this place is beautiful, and it looks like it's got everything.
except a conscience.
let me guess-- regulation indoor court? Exactly.
ladies and gentlemen, this is where the magic happens.
sweet home.
the panels you're walking on covered the floor of the United States Supreme Court for 68 years.
this thing's seen better days.
Oh, it looked a lot better when Clarence Darrow sat in it during the Scopes Monkey Trial.
that lamp was on Ito's desk during OJ.
this jury box is from the set of To Kill a Mockingbird.
you don't get enough of the courtroom during trial?
not surprisingly, you miss the point entirely.
trials are won before you ever step foot in the courtroom.
there are eight cameras, real-time polling technology for mock jurors, the same voice analysis system used by the FBI at Quantico.
I never make an argument in open court before it has been perfected in this room.
now, guys, we got one shot at this case.
destroy Jenny Dennison on the stand.
we must convince the jury that she was this predatory little slut who lured Terrence Rourke into her hotel room, got into a lovers' quarrel and killed him in cold blood.
how can we be sure the defense will put Jenny on the stand?
cause Anita still has to prove self-defense.
Jenny's needs the only living witness.
RAINA: Slamming the victim in a sex trial can backfire, Especially if the prosecutor is a guy.
that's why I'm not going to question Jenny. You are.
we're going to put some of that patented hostility to work.
I won't attack a defendant without foundation in order to prejudice the jury.
CASEY: She's right, it's an ugly tactic. And it looks desperate.
I don't know if you've noticed this yet, guys, we are desperate.
rule number one-- trial is war.
and war tends to get ugly.
I'll do it.
I have no problem tearing Barbie's head off.
why does that not surprise me?
a smart defendant like Jenny is not going to lose it on the stand. Oh, really?
I'll tell you what-- just for kicks and giggles, why don't you... May I, please?
...step into the witness box.
and, guys, you get in the jury box. Come on.
judge Margaret.
you're sworn, charged with killing a man you just had sex with.
ms. Troy, how old are you? 29.
how many men have you had sex with? What?
your Honor?
the witness will answer.
I have no idea.
more than 50? I don't... Of course not...
30? Am I getting closer?
you may keep a running count, but I don't.
have you ever contracted a venereal disease?
have you ever contracted a venereal disease?
once.
in college.
so you enjoy unprotected sex? I was 20 years old.
ever engage in S&M?
bondage? Sex with another woman?
multiple partners? Know what? I'm done.
is that a crucifix around your neck?
don't go there. Are you a practicing Christian? Yes.
would you say that you understand the teachings of your church?
how do you reconcile those teachings with your wanton promiscuity?
you don't know the first thing about me!
you may live in a fancy mansion, but you are still a low-rent ambulance-chasing son of a bitch.
no more questions, Your Honor.
you may step down.
okay, guys, I'll be back in two hours.
and when I return, I want to see Jennifer Dennison's entrails hanging from that chandelier right next to Ms. Troy's.
thanks for the picture, huh? Sure.
so what do you think?
I think, uh... About what?
about Honors French?
Oh, uh, look, it seems to me that you want to learn French, that we should get you an apartment in Paris...
but, Dad, I'm talking about looking good on college applications. Sorry. Yes.
no. Good, that's much better.
use the stuff with the boyfriend.
it's great. Yes, great.
I'll be... I'll be back soon. Bye.
electronic handcuff.
so we were... Where were we?
Oh, en France. Know what?
we should probably just go.
you're really busy.
no, Julie, I'm...
it's fine. I'm not mad.
in fact, I couldn't think of a more appropriate way to say good-bye.
don't say that... Dad, I never fit into your life.
now I can finally stop trying.
you know, when that lady died and you lost it,
I really thought you'd changed.
he said, "I just made you a star."
I had no idea what he meant.
then he showed me his camera.
he filmed your lovemaking?
he must have brought the camera with him.
set it up when I wasn't looking.
and what happened next?
I told Terry to give me the tape.
he laughedn my face.
pinned me down on the bed.
I kept thinking about my parents
how much this would hurt them.
that's when I spotted the knife.
and what did you do?
I grabbed the knife.
and I swung it.
did you call 911 right away?
Jenny: Yes.
ms. Dennison, why didn't the police find the tape?
before they came, I went to my manager's room, gave her the tape.
I didn't want anyone to see it.
now it's everywhere.
no further questions.
I'm going to start with the high school stuff and build from there.
judge: Does the prosecution wish to cross-examine the witness?
Mr. Stark, do you wish to question this witness?
we have no questions, Your Honor.
I saw Jenny Dennison-- I didn't see a guilty defendant.
I saw a troubled young girl. I saw...
but she killed somebody.
stone cold guilty. Murderer.
should have torn her to shreds.
MADELEINE: The maid let us in.
start looking for a new maid.
okay, guys, how do you want to do this?
take turns calling me a hypocrite? What? Saying, oh, yeah, trial is war, and I'm a deserter.
I got it all. Come on. Take your best shot.
come on, let's go.
state of Ohio v. Pennsylvania.
the same equipment used by Anita's serology expert yielded faulty results.
grounds for a successful appeal.
casts doubt on Anita's theory.
Jenny attended a program for gifted students her senior year of high school.
guy who runs it says she's a narcissist and a liar.
he's happy to testify to it in court.
broke down the timeline.
there's a discrepancy between Jenny's account and the room service log.
Sabado's off the cheese fries, but he's on a mean cupcake bender.
juror number six is born again.
thinks rock 'n' roll is the devil's music.
and the promiscuity angle should help us with three and ten.
you worked your tails off, and I let you down.
so what's the next move?
honestly? I don't have one.
make one up. Truth is relative.
yada, yada. Let's go.
you blew it, but you're still the only shot we have to win this case.
and that is why we're here. Remember?
see that?
she made that when she was 15.
imagine how her friends laughed at her when she said, "Oh, I'm going to be a big star."
but, hey, look at her now.
Yeah. She's on trial for murder.
the point is, she knew what she wanted.
she was driven by pure ambition.
nothing else mattered.
you know, all my life, all I ever wanted to be was the best lawyer in the world.
but when you lose that drive
that consuming ambition
you're done.
mine died with Deena Brock.
you're still the best. If that were true,
I would have let you rip Jenny's heart out.
to be the best, you got to be like her.
be in complete control.
never leave anything to chance.
never let yourself be vulnerable.
obsessive control.
never let yourself be the victim.
Oh, man. Oh, man.
Yes. Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I want the original of that tape brought to the LAPD Crime Lab.
I want it back in two hours.
in the bullpen, 30 minutes!
Yes!
I am great, and yet...
I am humble.
the Prosecution now wishes to cross-examine the witness?
Yes, Your Honor.
what now?
watch and learn.
thank you.
ms. Dennison, when did you first decide you wanted to be a pop star?
I guess it was the first time I saw a Madonna video.
I was seven.
besides Madonna, what other performers do you emulate?
J. Lo? Britney Spears? Christina Aguilera?
definitely.
now, those singers incorporate an explicit sexuality into their performances, but according to publicity material from Defiance Records, your label, you are the next Norah Jones
wholesome, spiritual and family-friendly.
doesn't that bother you?
defiance signed me. They decide the best way to sell my music.
but you've been planning your career since you were in grade school, and you know that sex sells.
you're smart enough to know that.
so why do you think they didn't listen to you?
objection. What is the relevance of this line of inquiry?
judge: Mr. Stark? Ms. Dennison...
this is a video you made four years ago on an SD200 camcorder.
it is Defense Exhibit D, previously entered.
