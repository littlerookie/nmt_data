hegel I incline towards those who see his career as having its own dialectical development the tractatus being the thesis, the investigations the antithesis, so to speak.
hegel an interesting point, mr. chairman.
hegel claimed to have overcome paradox, but kierkegaard was not convinced.
hegel describes this involvement as "freelove andboundlessblessedness," just because of its universal inclusiveness.
hegel disagreed: like many of his fellow 19th century system builders, such as schelling and fichte, he could not bear these kantian tensions, and sought a resolution.
hegel explains in meticulous detail how thought and reality emerge together, such as in the case of human self-consciousness, demonstrated in roger duncan's article.
hegel has expanded his view on philosophy in "the preface of phanomenologie des geistes" and distinguished his philosophic conception front kant and schelling through the statement of philosophy.
hegel is commonly associated with the idea that history has an inherent logic in which ideas are embodied in practice and then left behind in a dialectical process in which they are transcended by their opposites.
hegel is not only a great philosopher, but also a successful educationist in philosophy.
hegel is still central in the modern philosophical syllabus, whereas schopenhauer remains relatively marginal; and there is little doubt that hegel's influence within philosophy has been incomparably greater. But that is by no means the end of the matter.
hegel opposes and negates subjective caprice and that is quite incisive in law philosophy.
hegel saw history as an evolution of ideas that would culminate in the ideal liberal-democratic state.
hegel takes the reader through the evolution of consciousness
hegel thought that the god of religion was an intuition of absolute spirit or geist.
hegel was not the only important post-kantian philosopher.
hegel's ontology and theory of historicity.
hegel's perspective of the world history, like his philosophy, bears with it wholism, mentalism and mysticism.
hegel's philosophy is an all-embracing complex and profound contradictory system.
