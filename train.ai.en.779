Mithrandir.
they broke through our defenses.
they've taken the bridge and the west bank.
battalions of Orcs are crossing the river. - It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.
long has he foreseen this doom. - Foreseen and done nothing.
Faramir?
this is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path.
no.
you've seen Frodo and Sam?
where? When? - I n lthilien.
not two days ago.
Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale.
and then the pass of Cirith Ungol.
what does that mean?
what's wrong? - Faramir, tell me everything.
careful, master. Careful.
very far to fall.
very dangerous are the stairs.
come, master.
come to Smeagol.
Mr. Frodo.
get back, you!
don't touch him!
why does he hates poor Smeagol?
what has Smeagol ever done to him?
master?
master carries heavy burden.
Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.
fat one cannot know.
Smeagol look after master.
he wants it.
he needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.
very soon he will ask you for it. You will see.
the fat one will take it from you.
send forth all legions.
do not stop the attack until the city is taken.
slay them all.
what of the wizard? - I will break him.
what of Theoden's riders?
will Rohan's army come?
Mithrandir.
courage is the best defense that you have now.
here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor...
in peace or war...
in living or dying...
from...from this hour henceforth...
until my lord release me...
or death take me.
and I shall not forget it...
nor fail to reward that which is given.
fealty with love.
valor with honor.
disloyalty with vengeance.
I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses...
defenses that your brother long held intact.
what would you have me do? - I will not yield the river in Pelennor unfought.
Osgiliath must be retaken.
my lord, Osgiliath is overrun.
much must be risked in war.
is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord's will?
you wish now that our places had been exchanged...
that I had died and Boromir had lived.
Yes.
I wish that.
since you were robbed of Boromir...
I will do what I can in his stead.
if I should return, think better of me, Father.
that will depend on the manner of your return.
what are you up to?
sneaking off, are we?
sneaking?
sneaking?
fat Hobbit is always so polite.
Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find...
and they say "sneak."
sneak?
very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious.
very nice, very nice. - All right. All right!
you just startled me is all.
what were you doing?
sneaking.
fine. Have it your own way.
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.
we have to be moving on.
it's dark still.
it's always dark here.
it's gone!
the Elven bread. - What?
that's all we have left.
he took it. He must have!
Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.
Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread.
you're a lying wretch! What did you do with it?!
he doesn't eat it.
he can't have taken it. - Look.
what's this?
crumbs on his jackets. He took it!
he took it.
I seen him. He's always stuffing his face when master's not looking.
that's a filthy lie!
you stinking, two-faced sneak!
Sam! - Call me...
stop it!
Sam!
I'll kill him! - Sam! No!
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to go so far. I was just so... So angry.
here, just... Let's just rest a bit.
I'm all right. - No.
no, you're not all right. You're exhausted.
it's that Gollum.
it's this place.
it's that thing around your neck.
I could help a bit.
I could carry it for a while.
carry it for a while.
I could carry it... I could carry it.
share the load... Share the load... the load... the load.
get away!
I don't want to keep it.
I just want to help.
see? See?
he wants it for himself.
shut up, you!
go away! Get out of here!
no, Sam.
it's you.
I'm sorry, Sam.
but he's a liar.
he's poisoned you against me.
you can't help me anymore.
you don't mean that.
go home.
Faramir!
Faramir!
your father's will has turned to madness.
do not throw away your life so rashly.
where does my allegiance lie if not here?
your father loves you, Faramir.
he will remember it before the end.
can you sing, Master Hobbit?
well...
Yes.
at least, well enough for my own people.
but we have no songs for great halls...
and evil times.
and why should your songs be unfit for my halls?
come, sing me a song.
home is behind
the world ahead
and there are many paths to tread
through shadow
to the edge of night
until the stars are all alight
mist and shadow
cloud and shade
all shall fade
all shall
fade
March! March!
March! March! March!
make way for the king.
make way.
the king is here.
my lord.
hail to you, sire.
Grimbold, how many?
I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.
we have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.
where are the riders from Snowbourn? - None have come, my lord.
six thousand spears.
less than half of what I'd hoped for.
six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.
more will come.
every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.
we have till dawn, then we must ride.
the horses are restless...
and the men are quiet.
they grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.
that road there...
so, tell me how this works.
I don't know. I close my eyes.
I open them. Same as you.
ashes to ashes, dust to dust. We now lay Rex Thomas...
let's just start at the beginning.
no. Let's start at right now.
fair enough.
I understand you've gone back to work.
and they've got you working with a partner?
detective Britten, over here. - New guy, Vega.
they just want someone to hold my hand until they know I'm okay.
and are you okay?
Yes.
witnesses?
Yeah, I interviewed about 20, most were in the bar and came out after, but didn't actually see the cab driver get shot.
but this one guy, Mr. Weaver, he lives right above the...
where is he? - He's over there, sir.
how you doing? - Good, thanks.
I understand you saw the whole thing?
well, not the crime, exactly.
I just heard some shots, and then I looked out, and saw some guy run away.
where did he run?
it was up the block that way, and then into that alley around the corner, but...
didn't I already tell you this?
Yes, in... - Thanks for your help.
thank you.
sir, as I was trying to say, the witnesses on the ground confirm...
there's a camera on that building over there.
go see if it caught anything useful.
what? - Well, I been meaning to thank you, sir.
I been passed over for detective, twice, before this assignment, so I'm pretty sure I'd still be in uniform if you hadn't requested me.
I didn't request anyone.
if you got promoted, it has nothing to do with me.
they probably didn't want to waste anyone else's time baby-sitting me.
now, go check the camera.
and then what? - Then I go home.
Hey. - Oh, hey.
you're just in time to help me clean up.
you finished downstairs already?
Yeah, I did the study, too.
you're quick. I'd still be on the first wall.
did she start redecorating the house after the accident?
right after the funeral.
that's a common reaction, just looking for ways to start fresh.
has she gotten to your son's room?
I don't think she's even been in there yet.
and then what?
I wake up.
morning. - Morning.
that's Aaron. I gotta go.
so what about the match?
what about it?
I was thinking of coming.
whatever you want.
and you said the tennis is new?
Yeah, well, sort of. His mom's... was a very good player.
she played in college. She taught him.
he used to play a lot until he discovered football.
but he's decided to take it up again.
since your wife's funeral.
Yeah.
what's the purpose of the rubber band?
green is Rex's favorite color.
I wear a red one when I'm with Hannah.
you mean, in your dreams.
Yeah.
what else?
morning, Detective.
you see this coffee maker?
$600. My ex-wife, she wanted one of these.
I told her she wanted a $600 coffee maker, she should not have married a police.
eventually, we agreed on that.
tell me what you see, I'll tell you what you miss.
husband and wife victims?
multiple stab wounds. Some signs they put up a fight.
also some signs that they lost.
any money? Wallet, purse?
gone, along with one of the cars, a BMW.
all right, so, what am I missing?
home invasion that turned messy.
this is why I've avoided success at all costs.
I mean, you work your whole life to get some nice stuff just so somebody can come along and kill you for it.
calendar on the fridge says the girl was at a practice.
hoping to track her down now.
also says the parents should have been at a meeting.
but they wish they'd gone.
you smell that?
come on, you know I've had a cold since the Clinton Administration.
girl was here when it happened.
how do you know?
she hid in the closet, pissed herself, so either she ran when the killer left, or... He took her.
damn, that's what I get for hoping.
people! New deal!
and this has been happening since the accident?
Yeah.
that's fascinating. Not to be insensitive, it's just that...
but your mind... it's simply created an entire reality where you haven't actually lost your wife at all.
an elaborate and ongoing dream in which you haven't lost your son, relieving you of the obligation of dealing with his death.
maybe.
whether I'm with my wife or with my son...
it all feels completely real to me.
you mean you're not sure which is a dream?
meaning you can't tell whether you're awake or asleep at this very moment?
incredible. - Of course I'm awake.
I'm awake with my wife, and I close my eyes, I open them, and I'm awake with my son.
well, I can assure you, Detective Britten, this is not a dream.
what?
that's exactly what the other shrink said.
right here, take a look at this.
could hardly ask for a better angle.
and right there, turns right to the camera.
like he meant to look at it.
why would he do that?
detectives... we've got another one.
another what? - Dead cabbie.
cab pulls up, door opens, two loud bangs, pop, pop. Everybody scatters.
driver runs up on the sidewalk while the suspect walks right into the crowd.
skinny, cowboy hat, big sunglasses?
overweight, heavy beard, some kind of ball cap.
that's wonderful. We got a killer who does costume changes.
let me guess. He got himself caught on camera again?
Hey, Jimmy, give him the photo.
here you go.
almost like he posed for it.
you start taking statements. I'll see if I can find out anything out about the driver.
Yes, sir.
captain's moving me over to Western.
what? Why?
calling it a promotion, which is what they called it when they split us up.
you watch yourself with him.
there's nothing for him to see. I'm fine.
which is what I told her, and I'm being transferred.
so which is the faster way for him to get to where he wants to go?
telling the chief what she wants to hear, or telling her that you're fine?
detective, this is a safe place.
I'm not here to judge, I'm here to help.
you're not here to judge?!
my job depends on what you write down on that piece of paper.
you're doing your job, Detective.
I don't see any reason to change that.
in fact, I see value in you returning to a familiar routine.
but the loss you suffered is enormous, and for your health, you have to process it and deal with it, and I can help.
have you told your wife about what you're experiencing?
at first, I told her everything.
how he'd given up football and gone back to tennis.
about the girl who kept calling him.
I don't know, I think maybe I thought I could be a bridge, or something.
that even if they couldn't see each other, maybe if I told her about him, it would be like we were all still together.
you know, but to her, he's not still alive, and...
hearing about it, talking about it wasn't comforting.
it was torture.
just as you continue to imagine a life with him, your wife is coping by beginning to imagine a life without him.
but I assure you, however she might appear, she's not grieving any less.
did she tell you why she wants to move?
and yet, you're determined to stay there.
for me, the room upstairs isn't empty.
well, thanks for your help. Yeah.
Hey, Bird! - Yeah.
we got a stolen car found in the neighborhood. It's got to be how the killer got to the scene.
the neighbors said they saw it as early as 5: 00 p. m.
time of death isn't till 9: 00.
so, if he just wants to rip off a couple of rich people, what's he waiting for?
the girl. She doesn't get dropped off till 8: 45.
15 minutes later, the parents are dead, and they're out of there.
you say they were supposed to be at a meeting?
so, guy thinks he's gonna find her alone, when he doesn't...
he knows her, he knows them.
this wasn't a robbery. This was a planned abduction.
let's talk to the watch commander. - Okay, come on.
Hey.
I got something I got to do.
now? - I just need an hour. Two, max.
for what?
Yeah!
after two years playing football, I didn't expect him to end up in the final.
Tara. I'm the coach.
right. How do you do? - Hi.
he's exceptionally talented. - He had a very good teacher.
I'm so sorry. Your wife was an amazing person.
Thanks.
you know we used to play doubles together. Very briefly.
she used to mop the floor with us kids who thought we were ready for the tour.
she's the one who should have played professionally.
you think so? - I did. She was better than me.
I guess the grind just didn't appeal to her.
appealed to you, though?
thought it would be a lot more winning Wimbledon and less qualifying in New Jersey.
I don't really know what he's doing out there.
he just... It was his mother he used to talk to, you know?
we've talked about it a little.
Really? What does he say?
he misses her a lot. This helps him miss her a little less.
match point.
you know, if he wins this easily after a long layoff, I may never get him to practice.
Yeah!
son, you okay? - Hey, you're okay.
it's okay.
that is the best show on TV. - No way.
I watch total garbage TV, and... I don't even watch that.
Oh, come on. It's about models.
I think that holds a different appeal for a 15 year-old boy than it does for me.
what about you, Michael?
you have a favorite show?
Yeah. I like the one with the deranged chef.
Really? I always thought Mom recorded that.
no, that's me.
Why? You like it?
it's okay.
did you see the one where he made that guy...?
it's fine. - Hey, sorry.
Hey, it's Bird. We found the kidnapper's car.
Waverly Long Term Parking Lot by the docks. How quick can you get here?
Yeah, I got to take Rex home, and then... - I can take him if you want.
Yeah, I'll get a ride with Tara.
you sure that's okay?
I'll be right there.
Thanks. - Sure.
dad?
I'm... I'm glad you came today.
me, too.
this your idea or Tara's?
she's good at this kind of stuff.
all right. I'll see you at home. I won't be late, I promise.
what do we got?
lot security found the parents' car.
now, from the blood trail here, it looks like the kidnapper takes the girl out of the stolen Beemer and sticks her into whatever was parked in space 572.
take a look. Now, it was drizzling an hour ago.
the crime guy shot these before the ground dried.
now, the plan is to go over the plate numbers of all the cars in the lot, and see if anybody saw anything.
see if they remember what was parked in space 572.
actually... let's see if they remember what was parked behind him in space 611.
611. Why?
well, look, they both got a dry spot, about the same, so, I figure 611 left the same time as 572.
whoever was parked in 611 probably the last person to see the kidnapper's car.
wait a minute, so you're saying, you want to ask people about the space the car asn't parked in?
you know what? I'll call myself.
just send me all the numbers, I'll call from home.
you okay?
Yeah.
how's Rex? I mean, how's he doing?
he lost his mother.
how's anybody supposed to handle that?
don't forget, we have dinner tonight. Reservation's at 8: 00.
do me a favor. Don't wear any of your suits from work.
they creep me out.
Hey, Vega? - Yeah.
pull the tapes.
the security tapes? - Yeah.
we've seen 'em, like, 100 times.
this guy... once he ditches the disguise, he could come back and stand in the crowd all day, - we'd never know it. - Why would he do that?
think about it... look into the camera, the disguises.
he loves that he can practically turn himself in, and we still can't catch him.
I'm willing to bet he likes to have a front row seat to watch us flail.
and we run the tapes through the hours after the murders, maybe we can catch a face that pops out in both crowds. Yeah?
black beard and a wig matching the eyewitness descriptions turned up in a Dumpster 15 blocks from the second cab murder scene.
managed to pull a single red hair from the wig.
we'll run the DNA. - Oh, great.
Yeah, but the database is so small.
unless he's been in some serious trouble before, we probably won't get a hit.
all right, thanks.
well, we know we're looking for a redhead. That's something, right?
Yeah. Pull the tapes.
all right, first up, 611 Waverly.
all right, Ginger. Where are you?
what did you say? - Ginger?
no. 611 Waverly?
Yeah, the restaurant where the first cabbie got killed.
that's the address.
Why?
there's a Waverly Parking Lot out by the docks, right?
well, what does that have to do with this?
Britten? Hey, are you okay?
play the tape.
I'd say it's entirely reasonable.
it's even expected that these sorts of details would begin to cross over.
the things you're wrestling with in real life are likely to manifest themselves in your dream.
I knew about the Waverly Parking Lot and space 611
before I knew the address of the first cab driver murder.
so, how could I have dreamed it before I knew it?
but did you?
you said yourself they were on the paperwork.
you were at the location.
even if you didn't consciously note it, your brain might've, and if it found it important enough, the details... Waverly, 611...
would simply manifest themselves in your dreams via this imaginary parking lot.
or I really saw it in the parking lot first, and it's repeating itself now, in this dream here, to tell me that there's something important going on there.
detective Britten, as I said, there's no therapeutic value in allowing you to pretend that your realities are interchangeable.
there's no kidnapped child.
there's no car in a parking lot.
and sadly, but crucially, there's no world in which your son survived the accident.
Yeah, well, with all due respect, Doctor, I don't know that that's true.
if it isn't, then, there's a kidnapped girl who needs my help.
okay, so, then, let me ask you this.
which murder came first?
the cab driver.
so, you begin working on one case, here, in reality, and then, suddenly, you begin working another case, there, in your dream.
and we should also talk about the kind of case that you're working in your dream.
a missing child.
it's the very issue you're struggling to come to terms with, so your subconscious turns it into a case you have to solve.
I understand the pain you feel, Detective, but that pain is echoing in your dreams to tell you you have to deal with it, and not to ignore it.
and when you do, these dreams, fantasies... will end.
and, eventually, so will your pain.
so you're saying as soon as I decide which one is dead, then they'll stop showing up in my dreams?
I believe that's very likely.
what?
nothing. It's just nice to be out.
you already applied?
what?
you think I'm too old?
Oh, I'm sure you can do keg stands with the best of them.
I just... What about your work?
I quit.
Really?
okay.
and where are these schools at?
well, one of them's in the city, and the other one is in Oregon.
Oregon.
is that why you wanted to get dressed up, come out?
have this little chat?
no, I wanted to get dressed up and go out because I think it's time we start doing things again.
you remember that restaurant in New York like this?
fancy place.
you pretended to be a food critic. You got us that great table, that huge meal, all for free.
what made you think of that?
I was just thinking about how persuasive you can be.
you want some wine?
you know what I think?
I think we should go home.
I think we should get pregnant.
I know. I know it's fast.
and say what you will about us not working through our issues yet, but it's not about replacing him.
okay? It's not.
I just know that I'm going to want to have another one.
and I don't, I don't want to be 100 when he's in high school.
how do you know it would be a boy?
what?
when he's in high school," you said so.
how do you know?
I don't. - Yeah.
so, what do you think?
I think we should think about it.
for a while. Okay?
how's the house coming along?
just one more room.
Yeah.
did I tell you about my partner's kid playing tennis?
this kid. Reminds me of you.
me? - Yeah.
the way... he hit the ball.
I mean, 25 aces in the final. He crushed the serve.
it was like he poured his whole body into it, you know?
and he'd... he'd drive and shoot the forehand, and catching it, like you're always saying.
damn it, Michael.
I'm sorry.
you can't do that to me.
are you having these dreams again?
I had one.
he's gone. I miss him, too, Michael, desperately. But he's gone.
what's the psychiatrist say about it all?
Oh, you know, he's explaining to me stuff about sleep, dreams.
how everything works.
is it helping?
Yeah. I feel better every time I open my eyes.
you suddenly seem very concerned about what's real and what's not.
well, Dr. Lee said a couple of things that I'm having trouble letting go of.
I think it's useful to ask yourself why you might have created a therapist who is so confrontational.
is that your vision of how this should work?
no, that's the whole point. Why would I invent someone who argues with me?
Dr. Lee would say that the reason that you're so gentle, agreeing with me because you... 'cause you are me.
so it's his very nature that has you somehow focused on the idea that he's real, and has this all, suddenly, feeling like your dream.
okay.
what?
just give me a minute.
what are you doing?
all right.
here. Turn to any page.
just pick one.
and now, pick a spot about halfway down and start reading.
out loud.
the House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states, and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite...
what's going on? What am I... What am I doing here?
have you memorized the entire Constitution?
no.
then, if this is a dream, and your son has really died, instead of your wife, and you're just making all of this up, explain to me how you could turn to a random page and start quoting it back, word for word.
I can't. I don't know.
tell Dr. Lee that Dr Evans says that it's not as simple as he made it sound.
why would you do that?
you seem distracted by this fear that Dr. Lee had made some sort of bulletproof argument, and I just thought that...
no, no, you said nobody should... Wh...
I don't know the Constitution.
so, how could I... How could I do that unless this is...
Hannah, you in there?
Hi, it's Hannah. Leave a message.
Hey, it's me. Where are you?
I mean, I don't know where you are, so... I'm not sure what's going on.
it would be great to hear your voice, okay?
just give me a call.
no, no, no. She's here, she's here.
Michael... Come on!
Michael? What are you doing?
thank God you're still here.
of course I'm still here. What's going on?
I was calling your name. Why do you not hear me calling your name?
listen to me, it's okay. All right? I'm not going anywhere.
let me see your hand.
can you at least tell me what we're looking for? Maybe I can help.
I'm not sure. Well, then... why are we here?
I had a dream about it.
or I'm having a dream.
what? - Nothing.
look, we still have partial face matches from the tapes to look over, okay?
we... we got witnesses from the other scene.
the witness. - Yeah.
the guy from 611, Weaver.
he said he saw the killer run up the street, turn left at the alley.
Yeah, all the witnesses confirmed that he ran in that direction.
that's what the security tape shows. I mean, that's what happened.
did you go up to his apartment? Look out of his window?
no, why would I? Everyone had the same story.
there's no window on the other side.
if you're on the ground, you can see the alley from here. See the killer turn into it.
from up there, there's no way you know that.
unless you're the one who actually did it.
call it in.
hold on.
is there another entrance? - Yeah, the back.
cover it.
Hey!
move it! Stop!
police officer! Get out of the way!
police!
the guy had an apartment full of costumes, teaches eighth grade math.
you were joking, right? - About what?
coming back here because of a dream. I mean, that's not why we came, right?
cause you doing stuff like that, it's, the sort of thing they've been asking me about.
what have you been saying?
nothing.
Mike, you've been staring at that pavement for the last hour.
I think it's told you what it knows.
look, the blood trail led right to the car in 572.
why does it matter what was parked in 611?
I mean, don't you think if they would've seen anything, like, say, a bleeding little girl being forced out of one car and into another, that we would've heard from them by now?
wait.
wait, that's it.
what's it?
but we assumed that these vehicles left at about the same time.
okay. - What if they left at exactly the same time?
you see that dry patch right there?
that's a tow hitch. - It wasn't a pickup truck here.
it was a... a trailer or an RV in 611.
we got four camper hits in the same area we canvass for sex offenders.
three of them are sitting in their driveways.
and they're sending teams to check them out.
and the other just turned up by a lake in the foothills.
ranger says the guy's been there since Monday.
day of the murders.
have you seen his I. D?Did the guy have red hair?
red hair? Why?
no reason.
okay, look, tell them to keep a distant perimeter, we're on our way.
moving up.
what do you got? - Suspect's inside with the little girl.
saw it with your own eyes? - Yes, sir.
what's the best approach?
on the right.
you're safe.
didn't I tell you what would happened if you tried to get away?
she says he kept talking about marrying her.
that the Lord had brought them together.
you want to tell me how you knew he had red hair?
a hunch.
been a cop for 20 years. I only seen hunches on TV.
so you're gonna stick with that?
okay.
she got family to go to?
an aunt or something.
I'm not even sure she understands what happened yet.
remember when you used to think that "solved" and "fixed" meant the same thing?
your mind will allow you to go endlessly back and forth between these realities, if you let it.
you've created a mental Mobius strip.
how would you like me to help you if you're not willing to participate in a realistic examination of your situation?
I never said I needed help. They did.
I'm fine.
your Blood Alcohol Level was elevated the night of the accident, wasn't it?
I didn't have anything to drink.
that's what you said, but the medical report says that it was elevated, was it not?
have you considered the possibility that your condition comes not so much from a benevolent desire to keep your son alive, but an intense need to shield yourself from your own responsibility for his death?
it does raise a whole host of questions.
I'm telling you, there is no way that I drank that night.
but you don't remember anything about what led to the accident?
no.
maybe this is all your way of trying to help yourself remember.
just as you seem to work out your cases in your dreams, perhaps the fact that your wife survived in one and your son in the other, or that you have different partners in each, is actually all a way of getting you to think about that night.
clues, so to speak, about what actually happened.
detective Britten, this fantasy is far from benign.
while your brain should be resting, recharging, your subconscious is using it to hold up a detail and complicated alternate reality.
if we don't deal with that...
this situation will eventually become unsustainable.
look at your hand.
the moment of panic, of confusion, that led you to do that to yourself...
that's just the tip of an iceberg.
the thing is, Doctor...
Yes, I still see my wife and my son.
and I've also watched both of them lowered into the ground.
and when you see a loved one buried...
you have one thought, over and over and over again, and that's that you would do anything...
anything... to get them back.
so if you're telling me that the price of seeing them, feeling them...
...of having them in my life, is my sanity?
it's a price I will happily pay.
now, I'll come and see you, and talk to you as long as they make me.
but trust me, when it comes to letting one of them go...
I have no desire to ever make progress.
you going to see him tonight?
Yeah.
tell him I love him.
I will.
so tell me how this works. I'm awake with my wife, then I close my eyes.
I open them; I'm awake with my son.
and this has been happening since the accident?
so, you begin working on one case here in reality, and suddenly, you begin working another case there, in your dream.
it all feels completely real to me.
you can't tell whether you're awake or asleep at this very moment.
well, I can assure you, Detective Britten, this is not a dream.
that's exactly what the other shrink said.
did you wash these?
I presume that's teenager for "Thank you.
they, They smell weird.
weird? I-I don't know.
they used to smell different.
it's very difficult, isn't it? We can't begin to imagine all the...
the little ways that a loss affects us until we are confronted with it day by day.
maybe.
maybe some of those things aren't really lost.
what are you doing?
what? Fabric softener.
fabric softener.
my God, that is interesting.
do you know that the exact access to the unconscious mind that you're describing has been sought after since the beginning of civilization?
the Greeks used to sleep in temple chambers, hoping to receive insight from their dreams.
even philosophers and scientists have recorded incredible breakthroughs delivered to them while asleep.
guess I should have been a scientist.
all I do is end up working twice as many homicides.
bernard Mackenzie? The fertility doctor, you guys never heard of him?
40-year-old marathoner, and Tuesday he drops dead of a heart attack.
autopsy report comes back clean, but something about it kept bugging me.
so tonight I do a whole nother workup, and bingo, I find a reason to call my two bestest pals over in Homicide.
potassium chloride. Shot of that will give an Olympian a heart attack, but it's usually not very subtle, which is where this guy's killer gets smart.
the doctor here was diabetic, so they planted the chemical in his insulin, pushes it out of the blood, basically makes it untraceable.
unless you're really good, which I am.
so, congratulations, gentlemen,
Dr. Bernard Mackenzie's death is now officially a murder.
sorry. I thought there was more in the fridge.
I'll get to the store tomorrow. It's fine.
you know, I can go out, or like, eat at Cole's when you're going to be late.
his dad said it's okay.
what, you don't like cereal and soda night?
I'm a step away from giving you a bag of sugar and a spoon.
I'm just saying, we don't have to force ourselves to do this.
what, eat? At the table.
together every night.
you used to eat with your mother, right? When I wasn't here?
Yeah, usually.
what did she have to do to convince you to sit down with her?
I don't know.
I guess she cooked actual food.
what's all that? Mail. Rex's.
that was Cole's dad.
apparently Rex has been having stuff shipped to their address. Look at this.
catalogs. Junk mail.
this one looks like a bill.
could you pass me a knife?
Why? I want to open the box, see what's inside.
can we just... Can we leave that alone?
Why?
because I-I...
what's the point?
well, aren't you curious to see what it is?
I mean, he's having stuff shipped to somebody else's house.
all right, fine. Can you just leave it till I go?
what's wrong? I'm not like you.
okay, I...
yesterday, I found his cleat in the trunk of the car, and I... I remember he'd lost it,
Yeah. and he'd been looking for it for weeks, and I found it.
and I just stood there, and I...
it just about put me on the ground.
so, we'll... we'll go through his mail, I just...
I'm sorry.
I don't understand how it's so easy for you.
it-it's not that it's easy for me. I just... sometimes things, they don't remind me of him being gone, or the accident, they...
they remind me of him, you know?
I mean, I don't know what's in there, but on the off chance it might have made you think of him, in case it put a smile on your face...
I thought it was worth opening. I'm sorry.
no.
it just...
doesn't work like that for me.
why do you think that you and your wife have such different reactions when something reminds you of Rex?
sometimes I...
sometimes I think she's trying to deal with the fact that he's gone by pretending he was never here.
where as you simply insist on pretending that he's perfectly fine.
I know you want to hold on to your son, but have you considered the possibility that that fantasy may become incompatible with holding on to your wife?
just because I have a different perspective,
I don't see that as a bad thing.
maybe the fact that I see things differently allows me to know what questions to ask, what answers to focus on.
maybe it puts me in a better position to help.
what?
number three, Bernard Mackenzie.
what do you know about that? Some dead homeless guy.
Why? Dr. Bernard Mackenzie's death is now officially a murder.
let me see the file.
but they worked it. It's, you know, there's no evidence, no leads, it's a dead end.
why are you so interested in a dead homeless guy?
just get me the file. All right.
I think that these sorts of connections between your worlds can be incredibly beneficial, and I support a more active connection between your conscious and unconscious mind.
I think it's gonna aid you in uncovering and processing the source of your emotional issues.
well, would it surprise you to hear Dr. Lee feels slightly differently?
let me be clear, Detective.
your condition is the result of a deeply fractured psyche.
it is a problem.
it is not a tool.
well, you can call it whatever you like, Doctor.
I seem to be doing all right with it.
Mrs. Britten? Hey, Cole,
look, your dad was having some mail, dropped off that I guess Rex was having delivered here?
Yeah, yeah, right, I...
well, anyway, I opened this one and...
I was just wondering if you could tell me what that is?
Yeah, that's, It's a camshaft.
okay, uh, so new question.
I was wondering if you can tell me maybe why he had a camshaft delivered to your house?
right, yeah,
come with me.
we, uh, had been working on it for the past nine months.
every time we said we were going to the beach, we actually came here.
you guys bought this?
I- I know you guys had said no to him, and my parents said the same thing.
it was... It was really all my idea.
look, if it makes you feel any better, noverode it.
it wasn't finished when Rex,
after that, I didn't really feel like working on it, you know?
what's this? That's a feeler gauge.
it-it like changes the distance between the, rocker arm and the valve stems.
to be honest, Rex was kind of the one that figured all this stuff out.
you should finish it.
Rex would have wanted you to.
this is a total waste of time. They canvassed the neighborhood a month ago.
you think it's gotten more likely they're gonna know anything about a dead homeless junkie now?
there's only one way to find out.
did you even look at this guy's file?
bernard Mackenzie... four arrests for assault and battery, two for armed robbery, 11 for possession of narcotics.
now, this is the guy whose murder you suddenly feel compelled to solve?
we don't pick the victims, Vega.
it's our job to clear the cases. - Don't give me that.
this wasn't our case, and you did pick this victim.
so if you're gonna drag me all over the city trying to dig him up, the least you can do is tell me why this is so important.
who the hell is Bernard Mackenzie to you?
you want to know the truth? - Yes, I want to know the truth.
I don't have to explain myself to you. What?
I've been doing this job long enough that if I tell you some homeless guy's death is important, as far as you're concerned, it's a Kennedy assassination.
if you have trouble understanding that, you're gonna work me instead of the case all day, why don't you catch a cab back to the office, go do some paperwork, and I'll go be detective.
all right?
sir! Sir, excuse me. LAPD. Look, I'm a busy man, I'm very busy.
I understand that. You know why we're here, don't you?
you got any gum?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw that. I saw that a hundred percent.
a hundred and ten percent.
it was, like, this guy, you know, he went boom!
you know, and, like, the other guy, you know, like, dead!
where was this? Right down there.
right down there where down there is. Can you tell us what happened, exactly?
h- He was a little guy. The little guy shot him.
he just went boom! Shot him.
mean little guy. What'd he look like, this little guy?
he was a little man. I don't know, I-I-I didn't get that close.
I- I can't.
you-you see that house? The yellow one?
that's where they keep the antennas.
and when they broadcast, they-they tell you all kind of crazy stuff. I stay awake.
that's how I stay out of trouble. The broadcasts.
well, thank you.
if we have any more questions, we'll beam you up.
thank you for your time. If we need you, we'll find you.
you have to be kidding me.
that's your witness?
the guy doesn't even know what planet he's on, man. He thinks gum is money.
doesn't mean he didn't see anything. Can we go now?
wait, that's the guy? That's the guy you like for the Mackenzie murder? Yeah. Why?
well, you didn't tell me he was, like, ten feet tall.
that matter for some reason? No.
I'll lead; you close.
this is ridiculous. Then help me to see what I'm missing, Dr. Taylor.
did you threaten to kill Dr. Mackenzie in front of his wife?
we were arguing, I was venting... obviously, I didn't mean it.
look, the people you should be talking to are those religious groups that send us threatening e-mail all the time.
I've got a whole folder full of death threats for me and Mackenzie.
well, was it you or a religious group that got into an altercation with the victim two days before he was found dead.
I was simply trying to clean out my office. He accosted me.
and the office you were cleaning out, that's the one you lost in the lawsuit over the practice?
a practice worth millions of dollars a year? I didn't care about that.
Really? Mackenzie's the one who decided that we could start printing money if we just took on a wealthier crowd.
and, then, so he started turning away the people who really do need our help, because they're tough cases...
affects our stats. See, the kind of patients that Mackenzie wants, they need see you've got perfect stats.
so after a while I'd had enough.
and yes, when the contracts were all settled, it turns out he figured out a way to screw me out of my own practice.
but Mackenzie was the one who'd kill for another dollar.
I just wanted out.
whatever happened, it had nothing to do with me.
because you were at home that night watching television, by yourself, while your wife, your kids, anybody who could corroborate your story, was conveniently out.
do I have it right so far, Doctor?
how tall are you?
six, 11. Why?
it was the little guy. Definitely.
lawyer's here. Okay.
don't say a word. But I didn't do...
let me handle this. My client has nothing to say at this time.
if you want to speak further to him, you can charge him with something.
otherwise, it's time to let him go. Let him go?
your client made public threats and got into a fistfight with a man who cost him millions of dollars.
that man ended up dead two days later. Your client not only has no alibi, he had access to the office, knew that the victim was a diabetic, and being a doctor, knew exactly how to kill somebody and make it look like a heart attack.
your client isn't going anywhere. Then we're done talking.
what were you watching? Don't answer that.
you said you were watching television. What were you watching?
I can't help you if you don't talk.
it's an innocent question; you're saying you're innocent.
I don't see what the problem is.
what were you watching?
Sunday night, I was watching the football game.
office security said that the lights were tripped in the kitchen area where Mackenzie kept the insulin at around 9: 00 p. m.
that would've been... the third quarter.
REMEMBER??
Arthur, I'd advise you not to say anything else until we've had a chance to speak.
who was winning? - Arthur.
the Steelers.
they'd just scored. - Which you could've found out by looking at a newspaper.
you remember anything... the commentator said, anything specific?
I remember something about the defense.
how the team was so banged up, the one commentator said that they'd ask him to play. Something like that.
is that right?
let's find out.
they're not gonna get anywhere on the field.
they've got so many people injured, I think even I'm in their dime package.
you can see the defen...
all right, so Taylor either saw the game, or... made a tape and memorized the commentary.
since he didn't think he had an alibi, I'm saying he saw the game.
he's not the guy. That's quite a catch.
you don't pull that out of your hat and Taylor's in a cell waiting for a bail hearing.
just trying to see it from all the angles.
no. I saw it on your face the minute he walked in the room.
lot of evidence against him, but you didn't like him for it.
mind telling me what you saw that I didn't?
I don't know, s... something felt off.
and you asking him about his height, was that just part of what felt off to you?
intuition. Okay.
so where does that leave us? Well, he said they had death threats.
what do you say we pull all their computers and see what we come up with?
and what's your intuition telling you about going down that road?
if I hear from it, you will be the first person to know.
Hey. Anything? Yeah.
threatening e-mails were standard issue, but our technical guys went through the clinic's computer system and found out it had been hacked.
somebody had installed a backdoor to all the clinic's records, and within hours of the do murder about 20 of those records disappeared.
can we track this hacking somebody down? Let's ask Nat.
I. P. address belongs to Laura Harvison.
her records are among the ones deleted within hours after the murder.
I looked her up.
paralegal who barely knows how to use her own Facebook page.
it's really unlikely she pulled this off.
right. So who did? She's got a 17-year-old son.
more likely that's your hacker. All right. And, uh, what about the deleted records?
trying to retrieve copies from an off-site backup, but...
it's gonna take some time. You got a name for this 17-year-old kid?
all right. Let's go see if we can pull Sammy away from the keyboard long enough to have a chat.
Yeah. - Thanks.
just...
please, just... don't tell my mom.
why don't you walk us through what happened.
I was only trying to find my own file.
but once I was in, I accidentally altered some of the others.
I didn't mean to... it was stupid... but then every time I tried to fix it, I ended up just making it worse.
I didn't know what to do. Why so interested in your file?
my dad... he found out that he had cancer, like, a few months after he married my mom.
he... donated the-the...
sperm that they used to make me before he started his treatment.
and then... by the time that Dr. Mackenzie got my mom pregnant... he wasn't doing well.
and he died a few months after I was born.
I just wanted to... know my dad. I never knew him.
I've tried to find out about him.
this just seemed like the easiest way to get ahold of his medical records, you know.
why not just ask your mom?
my mom...
I'm, like, the last remaining bit of my dad.
I'm, like, this reminder of the man that she loved.
so it just seemed easier to get the information myself. At least, I thought it was.
I wasn't trying to mess anything up. I swear to you.
where were you on Sunday... Sunday night, about 9: 00 p. m?
Sunday? I was at a movie.
MmWere you with anyone? No.
but I might still have the ticket, if my mom hasn't thrown it out.
yes... There it is.
does-does that help? - Can I keep this?
Yeah, sure. - Okay.
thank you. We'll let you know if we have any other questions.
how tall are you, Sam?
five, five.
Why?
what's going on with you?
when did this case become about how tall everybody is?
it's kinda hard to explain. Try me.
well, it's just a theory. I spoke to the alarm company.
they said there's a little window in the doctor's office with a broken contact that they didn't bothered to fix because they didn't think anybody could fit through there.
okay. Well, I figure somebody got through there, fixed the doctor's insulin, slipped out again without leaving a trace.
you just said it's too small for anybody to fit through.
no. I said they said that.
somebody small could fit through there, somebody like Sam Harvison could fit through there.
so instead of worrying about the people who work there, the people who walk right through the front door, you want to focus on people who can fit through a window? Why?
well, we don't have any motive for people who worked there.
and what you got for window boy? Nothing... yet.
they're working on the records he deleted. Maybe there's something in there.
so you're waiting for evidence to point at something you've already decided instead of deciding anything based on the evidence? This is not how you work a case, Mike.
I mean, this kid owes his life to Dr. Mackenzie. Without him, there is no Sam Harvison.
that's not just no motive, that's like an anti-motive.
and what does any of this have to do with being able to fit through a window? - I don't know.
like I said, just a theory.
we're going to the beach. Be back later.
the beach? What are you talking about? We're supposed to have dinner.
cooked up a fajita feast.
come on, sit down.
get it while it's hot. Cole and I already made plans.
well, we made plans last night. And, Cole, no offense, but you look like you need fattening up. Come sit down.
I just want to hang out with my friends.
you know, I went to a lot of trouble here.
and it smells good, doesn't it?
come on, you know you want some. - Yeah, yeah.
save me some. You be back at 11: 00.
you call me at 10: 00.
Bye, Mr. Britten...
it's Coachella, man. It's, like, three days of amazing bands.
we take the bike out, camp, it'll be awesome.
you said it was slipping in first, right? And third to fourth.
so, uh, what do you think? We're gonna have a hard time explaining why we disappear for three days.
well, we'll make something up.
like, a field trip, or-or like a college visit or something.
my dad doesn't have any idea about that stuff. Yeah, dude, he's a detective.
okay. I think he's gonna figure it out. Hasn't figured this out, has he?
I... I guess not, I just... I don't know.
I mean, since when have you been so interested in, like, being smooshed together with thousands of people in hundred-degree heat? It's...
it's just a cool thing.
sorry I tried to include you. - Okay.
well, then, like, what if we say that...
do you want to walk? I'll be back.
dude, I thought we were gonna... I won't be long.
Hey, Emma. Yeah?
you wouldn't happen to be going to Coachella, would you?
Yeah. Why?
no reason.
morning. - Morning.
I'm sorry, I gotta run. - Yeah.
I got coffee on for you. Hey, I wanted to say something to you last night, but you got in so late, I... I went through that mail.
And? It was good.
that box was a part for a motorcycle...
Rex and Cole were rebuilding.
what? Yeah.
apparently, every time they went to the beach, that's where they went, to work on it.
the beach. I'm telling you.
you should see this thing, it's amazing. I mean, I didn't even know Rex could change batteries, let alone do anything mechanical.
didn't we tell him clearly no motorcycle?
but I-I... he wanted it, so he found a way.
sound like anyone you know?
anyway, I wanted to thank you. For what?
you were right. Yeah, I-I...
when I saw that motorcycle, or when I saw this thing that Rex was just pouring himself into, and-and I didn't even know about it, something about it just felt...
weirdly alive.
you know, and I wasn't standing there sobbing.
I was... I felt proud.
Yeah, it was just nice to think about Rex and feel something other than devastated.
that's great.
so, I'm gonna take Cole down to the shop, get some last parts and...
you should come by, check it out.
Yeah, well, I'd love to.
all right. The beach.
you gonna be late? I don't know.
I'm kinda caught up on one at the moment. I love you.
love you.
we got a fresh one. Stabbing victim on Grand.
they're waiting on us. Roll it to DaSilva. We're on one.
we're not on anything. We're looking at pictures of short people. This is insane.
we're up. This is our case. Let's go.
detective Britten? - Hey.
why don't you guys head over to Observation One. I'll be there in a minute.
Could-could I maybe get a sandwich? Sure.
get him a sandwich.
you have to be kidding me.
I already told you, if you don't want to work it, go read a comic book, just stay out of my way. There's nothing to work on.
and I'm not the one in the way, you are. I just told you we're up.
we have a real case, with a body on the ground, and you want to have lunch with a homeless guy?
we're not up. It's DaSilva's.
???
I didn't work my ass off to get promoted just so you can start hanging stuff on me that is never going to close. You are nowhere on this.
there's nowhere to go. - Since you bring it up, why don't we take a minute to remember why you did get promoted,
it wasn't just to close cases or not close cases, was it?
it was to watch over me, so they could have someone who would tell them anything they wanted to know.
someone who was so happy to get his badge, he's got no problem with spying on his fellow officers.
Hey, screw you. - Excuse me if I don't feel obligated
I killed myself for ten years. - to tell you everything I'm thinking when I know you're just gonna go running to mama.
Britten, what... - Hey! Britten.
get in here.
what's going on with you? I'm just trying to make some headway, and I got...
sit down.
you wanted to come back.
this is the way it has to be. Period.
right? You don't like Vega, you don't like your therapy, then my offer still stands.
what... to retire? That's ridiculous. No one is... not saying retire.
I'm saying... listen to me.
you just experienced a horrific tragedy.
so instead of spending your days and nights knee-deep in everybody else's tragedies, why don't you let me put you somewhere that let's you do what's important to you, that let's you be there for your wife, that lets you guys rebuild.
look, I'm fine.
okay. You want to be out there, then be out there.
but put this Mackenzie thing aside, and go take this case.
can you do that? Can you?
Yes, yes.
good.
Hey, why are you pulling all these mug shots of short people anyway?
cause the witness saw a little guy.
the homeless guy who hears voices?
I mean the witness.
all right, give him his sandwich, get him out of here.
Harvison deleted these records from the doctor's system shortly after the murder.
it could be a dead end, it's probably nothing, but, uh, none of us know how to read this stuff.
just want to make sure I'm not missing something. Really appreciate you taking a look.
no problem. Let's take a look.
Yeah, looks like standard stuff.
prenatal labs, genetic panels.
these...
what?
it's impossible.
doc? What do you got? They're all related.
Yeah, the markers on these genetic panels are all the same.
what are you saying?
how could that happen? Mackenzie.
Mackenzie substituted his own sperm.
there's a lot of kids out there who don't know who their dad is.
think I met one who does.
ordered on-line, but the theater shows it was never scanned.
you ordered potassium chloride from a Canadian pharmacy over a month ago.
Sam? Techs have just started digging into your computer, but they, uh, they've already found searches for "induced heart attack," "diabetes," "insulin.
we know.
do you have to tell people what he was doing?
it'll come out, eventually.
when did you find out? AP Anatomy.
we were doing these advanced genetic panels as a project, and I didn't understand all the complicated stuff at first, but... I understood one...
simple thing.
my blood type was wrong.
you know, like, incompatible with my parents.
and I wanted to talk to my mom, I did, but I didn't want to freak her out.
I don't know. It just kept bothering me.
is that when you hacked into the doctor's system?
I was only trying to find my own records, just trying to figure out what's going on.
then...
that's when I find all these other records.
but the records have the exact same genetic markers as mine.
it's impossible.
unless we were all related. How many?
I found 15 in the last three years.
the tests only go back that far.
I'm 17.
even if I was the first, there's hundreds of us now.
why didn't you just bring the evidence to us? So you could do what?
put him away for 11 years, or eight years, or 15 months with a $30, 000 fine?
because that's what happened to the last three doctors who got caught.
and then what happens to us? You know, the kids like me, their families?
do you have any idea what it's like to find out...
you're living your life, and then just one day out of the blue, instead of being a part of your family, instead of being... linked to the people that you love, you find out you're the child of a monster.
and once you hear that, that's a life sentence. There's no going back.
so what? You want me to wreck all of these people's lives, and, what, the person who's responsible gets what, just, like, a slap on the wrist?
you thought murder was a better answer?
I got rid of the problem and protected the people who wouldn't want to know.
I mean, even his family, they get to think of him as this, as this nice, respected doctor who died of a heart attack.
I stopped him, no one else got hurt.
look, look, please, just do what you want with me.
I- I will help you, I-I'll plead.
you can't let the rest of them find out.
you allowed a dream to direct your investigation.
doesn't that concern you? It didn't direct my investigation.
it made me think we might be missing something in the case. Which we probably are.
even if you had more time, you haven't intimated a great deal of confidence that you actually had anything to go on, that there was anything else you could have done.
would you say that that's accurate?
I think that there is a lesson here in relying on these dreams as anything other than dreams.
the subconscious can be a highly unreliable witness.
it's quite remarkable. Really.
you noted something subconsciously, you repeated it to yourself in your dream to focus on it, and because you imagined that you were looking for this little guy, you shaped the investigation of Dr. Mackenzie's murder in a way that almost anyone else might have missed.
and in the end, you got your man.
I'm still missing something.
the other case...
it didn't pay off.
all right, you want to lead? What?
the first suspect in our new case got brought in last night.
would you like to lead the interrogation?
a- Are you sure?
no, but I figure if you can come at him half as strong as you came at me, it might scare something out of him.
I'm willing to try.
I'm pretty sure I can handle that. All right. Let's go to work.
HT???
HT????
perhaps your subconscious was satisfied.
didn't feel obligated to provide the other case with an ending.
it's likely, it's because you turned your attention to focusing yourself on the other thing you realized you'd been missing.
what's that? Rex's motorcycle.
you took something that you must have been conscious of at some low level, and you created a story to bring your attention to it.
and in the process, you find a way that strengthens the bonds that you really find most important.
going to the beach with Cole. Be back later.
Hey, Rex? Yeah?
wear a helmet.
o- Okay.
Thanks.
dad? Yeah?
do you... you want to see it?
Yeah, sure.
all right.
Yeah. Kind of can't believe it actually runs.
I can.
do you want to take it for a spin?
so?
so I'm monitoring him. He's fine.
no one finds that very reassuring.
I don't really care what anyone finds reassuring.
I have it under control. That's what you said before.
you should have listened.
instead of taking out his whole family.
it's the most insane... We can debate the details all you want, but let's remember, we were protecting you as much as anyone.
I never asked for that. I don't want that kind of protection.
look, Harper, we've got a good thing here.
all anybody wants is to get past this and keep going.
then let me handle Britten.
I'm telling you, you do anything else, this will get much worse before it gets better.
I am on top of it. All right.
I trust you'll keep us informed.
the guy that you used for the accident... was he short?
short? Yeah, like a, like a little guy.
I suppose so. Why?
did Britten say something? No, I was just wondering.
because if you think he remembers anything... I said it's nothing.
I'll keep you informed.
next THURSDAY 109C ???? 1
some??
it???
you???
I MEAN???
WIHT???
you???
you FIND???
that PLACE???
come on, guys! Come on!
get off him!
what's wrong with you? I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it.
what the hell's going on?
he used one of my rackets without asking and he broke it.
so you tackle him? I already said I'd pay for it.
you use my racket all the time. What's the big deal?
where do you think you're going?
principal's office. Isn't that where you were going to send me?
I said I'd apologize.
what else do you want from me? I'd like to know what the hell happened out there.
he broke my racket. That's an excuse. That's not an explanation.
look, this isn't like you. How do you know?
and if you think you're going to suspend me from the team, don't bother. I quit.
no one wants to see you quit.
Rex. - What?
come on.
can we just go?
now you understand that anger is a typical response for a child who's experienced something as tragic and unjust as losing a parent.
well, he's acting out in other ways. He's missing school. He's dropping grades.
how are you handling that? Not well.
I mean, I try and help and... He won't let me in.
and, uh...
I feel...
what?
...helpless.
has it occurred to you that part of why you're finding it difficult to help your son is because you haven't truly accepted what he's experiencing.
of course I have.
do you believe your wife is dead, detective Britten?
I wonder if this isn't why you're having such difficulty connecting with Rex.
now how can you expect to help your son through his loss when you're in denial over that same loss?
Why's the media so interested in this?
well, yacht belongs to a couple of guys who own some tech firm up North.
one of them is engaged to a famous lingerie model.
she and her model friends were on board when the victim drowned.
paparazzi hear someone died next to a celebrity, this is what you get.
she friends with whoever was famous? No, her names Annie Yang.
she worked for one of the guys who owned the boat.
they were a couple Miles offshore partying, doing 17 knots when she jumped from a stateroom.
couple crew went in after her but, uh, she was dead by the time they hauled her in.
anyone see her go over?
no, all anyone saw was when she actually hit the water.
how many are we talking about, and why are they getting off the boat?
almost a hundred, but we're holding them all at the end of the dock for you.
a hundred witnesses who didn't witness what may or may not be an actual crime.
this is shaping up to be a great night.
so tell me how this works.
I'm awake with my wife, and I close my eyes, I open them, I'm awake with my son.
and this has been happening since the accident? So you begin working on one case here in reality, and then suddenly you begin working another case there in your dream.
it all feels completely real to me.
you can't tell whether you're awake or asleep at this very moment?
well, I can assure you, detective Britten, this is not a dream.
that's exactly what the other shrink said.
all right guys, give me some space, please. Thank you.
looks like she had trouble keeping everything down.
guess this is where she went over.
Yeah, they said the gate was opened when they came up.
what? The handle's clean.
okay. She opens the gate, but she doesn't leave any kind of print? Not even a smudge? Well, maybe she bumped into it.
maybe she... she didn't mean to commit suicide after all.
she was was wasted. You know, hit it. Went in.
Yeah, or maybe somebody opened it for her, and wiped it down afterwards.
isn't that a reach? Detectives, we got the guys who own the boat.
we've taken their statements, but if you have a few minutes to sit, they'd like to talk to you.
gentleman, detectives Britten and Vega.
I'm Cameron Fuller. Darin, Darin Knox.
ms. Yang worked for you, right? Not me.
Annie was my assistant.
we were also sleeping together.
except he neglected to mention that to the officer who interviewed him, so I told him, he better tell you.
why didn't you mention it? I was ashamed, okay?
you're the one that's engaged to this celebrity? Yeah, that's correct.
so, what happened? I told Annie this morning that...
that we need to end things. And, uh, she seemed okay.
but tonight after she'd been drinking, it was pretty obvious that she wasn't.
what was she doing? Embarrassing herself.
she was all over camera.
I told him to take her to a stateroom and put her to bed, where she made it worse.
and was that difficult? Did she resist?
no. The opposite, actually.
she thought I wanted to sleep with her.
I told her that I couldn't and we argued for a bit, but she was so drunk.
when I left, she was asleep. So, I thought she'd be fine.
and where were you when she went overboard?
I was on the deck with Monique.
and about 20 other people. And I was talking to some investors when...
I wanted to jump in after her.
I did, but the crew... they asked us to let them handle it.
Yeah. She said she couldn't live without me.
and I just thought she was being dramatic, you know?
I never imagined...
I shouldn't have left her alone. Look, this is a...
terrible situation and obviously something we'd prefer to keep quiet.
I know you guys have a job to do, but if there's any way you can, limit who you tell.
we're a growing company, but we're a young company, and, uh, bad publicity is something we just can't afford.
well, we will be as, uh, discreet as we can be.
but thank you for coming forward. I want to see the toxicology report.
Mr. Britten!
Kate? - Yes!
what are you doing here?
I was here for the party until, you know.
you work for the company? No, no. I live in New York now.
I'm an investment banker. We, uh, funded these guys.
well.
I know. Long way from being Rex's babysitter, right?
I'm so sorry. I... I was out of the country when it happened.
I meant to call. I just felt... sure. We hadn't seen each other in so long, I felt weird.
it's okay.
look, I don't suppose you know how long they're going to keep us.
I mean, I'd be happy to help if I saw anything, but I wasn't even outside.
I was coming out of the bathroom when I heard. What happened there?
that's actually how I heard.
Darin, one of the guys who owns the company... yeah.
he was totally freaked. He was running down the hallway, yelling that someone had jumped and slammed into me and spilled his wine.
I've had a long day. I'd just love to go back to my hotel.
sure. Well, let me, uh, let me ask a couple of questions, see what the situation is, and I promise I'll try and get you out of here as soon as I can, okay?
all right, thank you. All right.
all right. Bye.
aren't you gonna introduce me?
absolutely not. Don't even turn around. - But she looks...
she's a babysitter... - Don't even turn your head.
name's Charlie Simmons.
he had quite a reputation as a professional partier... Drugs, girls, full-time fun.
depends on your idea of fun, I suppose. Can you give us a minute, please.
neighbor said he heard something that sounded like a gunshot, but figured it was just another one of Charlie's parties, so he didn't call it in.
housekeeper came in this morning and found him as such.
look like he's been pretty much executed. Check out the fingers...
he's not gonna be playing the ukulele in heaven. Charlie definitely had a rough night.
come on. Let me show you why.
so they tied him up, go after a couple of fingers, get the combination, take whatever's in there out, and decide they don't need a witness.
we have any idea what was in there? - Nope.
s. I.D.'s gonna get back to us.
well, it's behind a panel. Maybe they knew it was here.
so let's start figuring out which of Charlie's friends was close enough to know he had a safe...
that's gonna take a while. Charlie had a lot of friends.
look at this. See the handle on the safe?
it's all marked up. - Yeah.
I'm saying, before they got the combination from Charlie, this idiot thought they could hammer their way in.
we're not looking for a genius. I can narrow it down even more.
alarm company says that Charlie set the alarm that night, but it was shut off 20 minutes before the murder by someone who entered a guest code.
so Charlie knew his killer?
likely. - All right.
let's find out how many people had guest codes. I know of one so far.
it was a shame. I mean, he could be such a nice man...
when he was himself. And when he wasn't himself?
well, it was the drugs. They made him angry.
did he ever take that out on you? No. Actually, the parties worked out okay for me.
Mr. Simmons would feel so guilty about the state the house was in, he paid me extra when I came to clean.
where were you Saturday night? Playing bingo.
till what time?
like, around midnight. I was with my niece.
she won $200. Nice.
we'll gonna need to speak to her. Okay. Of course.
this is the, uh, code you use for the alarm to get into the house when you're cleaning it for Mr. Simmons? Yes.
do you know who else had access to it? His stepbrother, Mark.
now he would stay sometimes and watch the house when Charlie was out of town, but, well, they haven't talked in a long time, so I don't know if he still had the code or not. Why not? Why aren't they talking?
something to do with Charlie's father dying,
I think. Anybody else you can think of?
girlfriends, ex-girlfriends?
they were not good together. Where would we find this Amber?
she's some kind of actress. Lives in Hollywood.
here it is.
what do you want? We're with the LAPD.
we need to ask you some questions. What for?
Kate... it's me. It's Michael Britten.
you used to babysit my son Rex.
when did this happened? We found him yesterday.
it wasn't an OD? No. He was murdered.
what about you and Mr. Simmons?
how did you meet? We met at a party.
he said he liked my work in some film.
it was a terrible film, but I think he actually meant it.
and, we started dating or something.
or something?
guys like Charlie... They're just sort of looking for younger girls to have around.
they take care of you, buy you nice things.
he let me move in. When was this?
a little under a year. But he cut me loose about a month ago.
what happened? He went to rehab.
he dropped out after a week, but that was it.
not that I blame him. I mean, we were both a mess by the end.
all we did was get high together.
and what have you been doing since?
well, I've been looking for work.
I signed with a new agent, and he's got some things lined up.
where were you on Saturday night?
where were you on Saturday night?
in the ER.
I passed out in a club.
the cops didn't know what to do with me, so they took me to the hospital. Let me sleep it off.
I have the discharge papers if you want them. That would be great.
sure. - Okay.
hold on.
what can you tell me about Mr. Simmons' stepbrother Mark?
not much. He's some, uh... Rocky wannabe.
always in training or something.
they weren't speaking when Charlie and I started hanging out.
he came over once with some papers Charlie had to sign.
he didn't like me very much. Why is that?
he thought I was part of Charlie's problems.
Kate, what are you using? Nothing.
right now.
I know a really good program and I know the people there pretty well.
why don't you let me help you get you in there.
believe it or not, I was doing just fine 20 minutes ago when I'd forgotten you existed.
I don't need your help, Mr. Britten. I just need you to leave.
seeing this woman Kate in reality, and then dreaming about her where her life has unraveled, what comes to mind?
I don't know. Things...
well, things are, obviously, they're different.
you've created different versions of everything in order to protect yourself from the discovery that this is reality.
the fact that this Kate person shows up in the world in which you see Rex proves that that's a dream.
how?
would you have dreamt of running into someone you haven't seen for ten years, and then the very next day she just happens to show up in reality?
isn't it far more reasonable that you ran into her here in reality first, on the boat, and then your mind carried her over into your dream?
you said that Kate was Charlie's girlfriend, right?
Yeah.
so I'm willing to bet that there's something in the house, a-a picture, some mail, something that you subconsciously noted that drew Kate to your mind, and you called her to life in your dream.
that picture isn't real. You went back and placed it in your dream to try to continue to spin endlessly on the question of where Kate appeared first.
every time the answers become clear, you try to find ways to cover them up.
I think what's more relevant to the question of which Kate is real, is why you're seeing her in one world and reflecting her so differently in the other.
I don't know.
it's not like she's...
well, either of them aren't particularly central to either case.
well, is it possible that these diverging Kates have less to do with the cases you're working on, and more to do with Rex?
Rex? Yeah, think about it.
Kate was someone who used to take care of Rex.
maybe her appearance in both worlds is telling you something about the difficulty you're having connecting with Rex.
guess who I ran into yesterday.
who? - Kate.
babysitter Kate? - Yeah.
she was, like, the Rex whisperer. He loved her.
he did, didn't he?
if Rex had a tantrum or he was moody, she would make this amazing paper airplane.
it could, like, stay in the air for five minutes. Rex would stand there and watch it make these wide, lazy loops, and forget anything that was bothering him.
I'm pretty sure I put one in his scrapbook.
where did you run into Kate? I took her statement.
she was, she was at a party where something happened.
I always wondered what happened to Kate. I think she did good.
she's some big cheese investment banker in New York now.
good for her. Yeah.
I'd heard she struggled with loss of her sister.
her sister died? Yeah.
I told you that when it happened.
it was awful. It was some freak surfing accident in Mexico.
I completely forgot. Yeah, she went through a really rough time.
something must have really turned her around.
she's like the Rex whisperer. She would make this amazing paper airplane.
it could, like, stay in the air for five minutes.
I'm pretty sure I put one in his scrapbook.
what are you doing? You don't remember this?
these little planes... You used to make 'em with Kate.
found it in the scrapbook. Kate?
your babysitter Kate. You remember her?
kind of. Not really.
I was, like, five.
I talked to Cole's parents last night. They called you?
no, I called them.
it's been two days, and you haven't apologized to Cole.
I will. When?
soon. Soon isn't good enough.
dad, I have a Spanish test first period, and you've been telling me to get my grade up.
can we not do this now?
Charlie and I we're never been close.
but we did okay until his dad Ben died, my stepdad.
Ben and I... We just clicked.
he and my mother... they got divorced about five years ago so it wasn't like he had to hang out with me.
we just got close. And what happened after he died?
I've been trying to get into UFC fighting, for a few years, and Ben's been staking me.
he was paying for my trainers, giving me an allowance to live on so I could focus on the fighting.
but when he died, Charlie got everything.
he just couldn't wait to cut me off. You two have words about that?
I went down to him, I said, "look, this is what Ben and I were into.
maybe you and I get something going." He laughed at me.
I figured, all right, it's his call.
when I started seeing where all Ben's money was going, to the big parties with the hookers and the drugs...
meanwhile, I'm struggling to get a job so I can stay in my apartment.
so I sued him.
how did that go? Got dropped.
I had a decent attorney file the papers, but I couldn't afford him after that, and...
after a while, I just gave up and moved on. When was all this?
maybe two months ago. Saturday night... Where were you?
I was here training. I had a match early the next morning. Why?
can anybody confirm that you were here?
no. I was here training by myself.
all right, thanks.
that was the D. A. Just went through the father's will.
victim was next in line.
in the event that anything happened to him, guess where the assets go.
to Mr. MMA himself, Mark Hudson.
exactly. So he kills his stepbrother, tries to make it look like an amateur robbery, hence the hammer marks on the safe handle, and he's all set.
we go search his place?
he's got a brain in his head, then he's gotten rid of the gun by now.
if we find a fingerprint or a fiber at the house, he'll say it's from a previous visit.
so how do we put him in Charlie's house on Saturday night?
?????? We go play detective.
so how's it going with Rex? I don't know. I can't get a word out of him.
can't even get an opening. Don't you find that ironic?
I mean, here you are, this big-time detective, you can get killers to turn, but you can't get two words from your own kid?
what is it? We're with the LAPD.
we'd like to ask you some questions about an incident at your neighbor's, Charlie Simmons.
I already told the officers I didn't hear or see anything unusual.
we're following up on information about a particular individual and a vehicle that we think may have been in the neighborhood that night.
if we could have a couple of minutes, please, sir.
hold the pictures up for the camera. I can tell you in two seconds.
there you go. Nope. Sorry.
didn't see either. Is that it?
think that thing can see the street from here? Yeah.
sir, is your camera linked to any kind of recording device? Yeah. Why?
open up please or we'll get a warrant.
your security system just became evidence in a murder investigation.
sleepyhead.
I was gonna let you sleep in, but Efram's on the phone.
he said you'd want me to wake you up. Thanks.
I'm making French toast. What's up?
banks called. Said he got the blood work back on our jumper.
thought we could meet over there. All right.
I'll call you when I'm on my way. All right.
we found a pretty large amount of a benzodiazepine in her blood, along with the alcohol. Probably something like alprazolam.
medical records show she had a prescription. So Cameron tells her the affair is off.
because?
because he realized he's engaged to a lingerie model.
she gets drunk, eats a bottle of her pills and jumps in the ocean. Sounds pretty suicidal to me.
Yeah, well, with everything floating through her system, my guess is she would've been sluggish enough to drown in a kiddie pool.
so, we're calling it? We recovered her phone, right?
it was in her purse? Yeah. We went through it, but nothing jumped out.
let's go through it again. Why?
because something should've jumped out. Great. Thanks.
I-I'll call you if I have any more questions. No, no, you were very helpful.
so that was the last of Annie Yang's five most contacted friends according to her phone records, and not one of them had any indication from her she was having an affair with Cameron Fuller.
well, having an affair with your boss isn't exactly something you advertise.
I mean, it's supposed to be kept a secret.
Yeah, well, apparently she kept it a secret from herself, 'cause I've read all the texts to Fuller, all the texts from Fuller;
??????
there's nothing other than completely professional communication.
maybe she erased the juicy ones. Everyone knows texting is how you get caught.
everyone? Everyone my age.
why would Fuller make it up?
lie to the cops and ruin his life?
maybe to give us a reason why she might have jumped and stop us looking for a reason why she might have been pushed.
there's a totally obvious reason why she would have jumped and no evidence that she didn't, but you're not ready to make the call.
all right, well, if you're so sure it's an open-and-shut case, why don't you stay here and erase some of your juicy texts?
where are you going? I'm going to Annie Yang's apartment.
Vega. Anything?
there are some pictures of Annie and Fuller. Together?
no, just some group shots from work.
anything else... e-mails?
they all look professional, but for all we kw they could have set up dummy e-mail accounts or deleted everything as soon as they got it.
sure.
I'm telling you,
I've seen people do some serious stuff to hide an affair.
look, you're the senior detective and I'm the rookie, but we've been here for hours and we've torn this place apart.
not only do we not have anything, we don't even know what we're looking for.
so don't take this the wrong way, but how much longer do we do this?
just give me a minute. Where are you going?
what are you looking for? I have no idea.
men's shaving cream.
well, there's your evidence she was sleeping with someone.
a safety deposit key.
all right. Let's get another warrant.
what is it? It's some kind of research document.
the real question is, why does a personal assistant have company documents in a safety deposit box, and why does she feel the need to hide the key in a can of shaving cream?
I don't know, but I'd still like to know what made you look under that sink.
when you've been doing the job as long as I have, sometimes you just have to follow your instincts.
all right, let's get this stuff to Len, see if he can make head or tail of it.
all right, thanks. He says they're materials research papers.
why would she tuck them away?
apparently the company found some way to manufacture silicon chips at a fraction of the normal cost, and all the funds they've raised over the past year were to get this off the ground.
these papers show it wasn't working.
so I'm guessing she confronted her boss... lover... Fuller...
and asked him why he was hiding this from the investors, and suddenly he's got a reason to toss her overboard or make it look like she jumped.
except Fuller was in front of 20 people on the deck of the boat when she went over, so...
well, the research papers weren't just bad for him.
they were bad for the whole company. Okay.
so he had help.
do you recognize that woman?
she's one of our bankers... Kate something.
Kate Porter? Right.
she says that seconds after Ms. Yang went overboard, you bumped into her in the corridor, spilled a drink on her dress.
that ring a bell? I-I don't know.
I mean, I-I remember yelling, someone had jumped.
I was panicked. Do you remember what the drink was?
no, I-I honestly don't.
because we had the, the stain tested.
it was red wine.
with traces of a benzodiazepine called alprazolam.
which is exactly what the toxicology report said was found in Ms. Yang's system when they fished her out of the water.
even if you could prove my client was carrying that drink, so what?
he could have picked it up anywhere.
even if you could prove he gave it to her, he could have been trying to calm her down.
right, that sounds likely. Doesn't it?
I got your partner in the other room, and he knows what you did up in that stateroom.
well, he was part of making up the whole story with you and, uh, putting on that wonderful performance on the night.
if you think that he's going to keep quiet, take the rap rather than save himself, then you keep hiding behind this slick-talking young man here, but if you want to trade the truth for any kind of leniency...
now is your time.
here's what I can do. I can tell the D. A. you cooperated.
that could change your life. But it's up to you.
you help us close this case, tell the truth, tell us what we need to hear, and maybe you might end up in a minimum security facility.
I liked her. I did.
she was with me from the start. She believed in me.
when she found out about the research results, she just said we should come forward.
she wasn't threatening anyone. I told Darin, and he...
look, you have to understand, he's been my partner since college, okay?
I just had some ideas. He turned them into a business.
settled all the problems. Like Annie?
Yeah.
he talked to her the morning of the boat party, and he offered her money, but she wouldn't take it.
so...
he came up with the boat idea and...
and the affair story. Who came up with the drugs?
he did. And then who gave them to her?
you? - No.
no, I...
Darin.
we combed the security footage on the block for the six hours before and after the murder.
mark Hudson's truck? - Yeah?
never showed up.
but I did find a car that I thought just didn't look right in the neighborhood.
well, people who live in these big homes, they hire a lot of help.
except the timing in and out of the neighborhood matches the murder exactly.
did we run the plate?
Yeah, belongs to a Katherine Porter.
I told you, I was in the ER. Until 9: 00.
Charlie Simmons was murdered two hours later. Well, I went home after that.
I can't believe you think...
Mr. Britten, tell him that I didn't do this, please.
you're telling me you didn't go to Charlie's house that night?
no. - You're sure about that?
I think I know where I was. Okay.
then help me out here.
cause that must be your car driving itself.
please, Mr. Britten. I used to take care of Rex.
you know me.
I do know you. And that's why...
I don't want you to make this any harder on yourself than it already is.
if you tell the truth,
I promise you I will do whatever I can to help you.
okay? Kate?
it wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Liam was just going to...
he was just supposed to take the money.
who's Liam? Liam Tell.
he's some guy I know who knows some other guys.
what kind of guys? Is he a dealer?
I was broke, and I hadn't had a hit in like a week, and I...
I thought I was losing my mind, and I knew that Charlie kept a lot of cash in his house, so I gave... I gave Liam the alarm code.
but I swear, he said he was just going to go in and scare Charlie...
and get him to open the safe.
this wasn't supposed to happen.
I'm so sorry.
you said that Kate lost her sister, yes? This way.
Yeah.
she drowned.
and from that one loss, you've imagined her life going in two very different directions.
thank you.
what do you make of that?
it's like everything else.
things are different, but...
equally plausible.
so, if you find it just as realistic that a tragedy can strengthen someone or destroy them, what I'm wondering is what you think makes it go in one direction or the other.
how did it come to this? I don't know.
for a long time, I couldn't stop thinking about that day.
there was a big storm, big waves.
we both grabbed our boards and rushed to get into it.
but when we got there...
my sister got nervous and said that maybe we should sit it out.
but I talked her into it.
the waves were horrible. The riptides were vicious.
we both... fell.
we lost track of each other and...
that was it.
and for a long time, I was so angry at myself and at the world.
I didn't see the point in anything.
and it's not like people didn't want to help.
it's just that when a thing like that happens, you don't know how to let them.
I skipped work. I didn't talk to my friends.
my mom kept trying to get me back out there, telling me it would make me feel better.
but I kept telling her that that was the point. I didn't want to feel any better.
eventually, she just let me be.
after that, I started finding my own ways to deal with the pain.
she just wouldn't let me be.
I don't know how my mom did it.
I mean, she was just as sad and hurt as I was.
somehow she had the strength to not only stay on her feet, but to get me back on mine.
and she must have tried a thousand times to get me back into my life, and I just kept saying no.
I guess I'm lucky that she was willing to try a thousand and one.
we have to talk about what happened.
again?
well, you haven't really told me anything.
not really. Cole broke my racquet.
I got mad.
end of story.
he broke a couple of strings.
come on.
why would you go after him like that? He's your best friend.
forget it. Doesn't matter.
it does matter.
it matters to me.
look.
I know you're going through a lot. I know it isn't easy for you.
I get that.
now, I don't expect you to tell me every little thing that's going through your head, but you have to talk to me because I'm all you've got.
and I'm not going anywhere.
I'm right here. I'm your father, and I love you.
Cole shouldn't have used my racquet. He says he'll fix it.
he can't fix it. - Why not?
because it was mom's.
I never used it; I just...
I liked to keep it in my bag.
made me feel... like something.
now it's gone. Well, he didn't know.
I know. I know that.
he wants to be nice. Everybody wants to be nice.
but I can't help it, okay?
I think about mom...
and I just get angry all over again.
well...
you know, it's okay to be angry.
I get pretty angry, too, sometimes.
come on, guys! Come on!
get off him!
what's wrong with you? I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it.
what the hell's going on?
he used one of my rackets without asking and he broke it.
so you tackle him? I already said I'd pay for it.
you use my racket all the time. What's the big deal?
where do you think you're going?
principal's office. Isn't that where you were going to send me?
I said I'd apologize.
what else do you want from me? I'd like to know what the hell happened out there.
he broke my racket. That's an excuse. That's not an explanation.
look, this isn't like you. How do you know?
and if you think you're going to suspend me from the team, don't bother. I quit.
no one wants to see you quit.
Rex. - What?
come on.
can we just go?
now you understand that anger is a typical response for a child who's experienced something as tragic and unjust as losing a parent.
well, he's acting out in other ways. He's missing school. He's dropping grades.
how are you handling that? Not well.
I mean, I try and help and... He won't let me in.
and, uh...
I feel...
what?
...helpless.
has it occurred to you that part of why you're finding it difficult to help your son is because you haven't truly accepted what he's experiencing.
of course I have.
do you believe your wife is dead, detective Britten?
I wonder if this isn't why you're having such difficulty connecting with Rex.
now how can you expect to help your son through his loss when you're in denial over that same loss?
Why's the media so interested in this?
well, yacht belongs to a couple of guys who own some tech firm up North.
one of them is engaged to a famous lingerie model.
she and her model friends were on board when the victim drowned.
paparazzi hear someone died next to a celebrity, this is what you get.
she friends with whoever was famous? No, her names Annie Yang.
she worked for one of the guys who owned the boat.
they were a couple Miles offshore partying, doing 17 knots when she jumped from a stateroom.
couple crew went in after her but, uh, she was dead by the time they hauled her in.
anyone see her go over?
no, all anyone saw was when she actually hit the water.
how many are we talking about, and why are they getting off the boat?
almost a hundred, but we're holding them all at the end of the dock for you.
a hundred witnesses who didn't witness what may or may not be an actual crime.
this is shaping up to be a great night.
so tell me how this works.
I'm awake with my wife, and I close my eyes, I open them, I'm awake with my son.
and this has been happening since the accident? So you begin working on one case here in reality, and then suddenly you begin working another case there in your dream.
it all feels completely real to me.
you can't tell whether you're awake or asleep at this very moment?
well, I can assure you, detective Britten, this is not a dream.
that's exactly what the other shrink said.
all right guys, give me some space, please. Thank you.
looks like she had trouble keeping everything down.
guess this is where she went over.
Yeah, they said the gate was opened when they came up.
what? The handle's clean.
okay. She opens the gate, but she doesn't leave any kind of print? Not even a smudge? Well, maybe she bumped into it.
maybe she... she didn't mean to commit suicide after all.
she was was wasted. You know, hit it. Went in.
Yeah, or maybe somebody opened it for her, and wiped it down afterwards.
isn't that a reach? Detectives, we got the guys who own the boat.
we've taken their statements, but if you have a few minutes to sit, they'd like to talk to you.
gentleman, detectives Britten and Vega.
I'm Cameron Fuller. Darin, Darin Knox.
ms. Yang worked for you, right? Not me.
Annie was my assistant.
we were also sleeping together.
except he neglected to mention that to the officer who interviewed him, so I told him, he better tell you.
why didn't you mention it? I was ashamed, okay?
you're the one that's engaged to this celebrity? Yeah, that's correct.
so, what happened? I told Annie this morning that...
that we need to end things. And, uh, she seemed okay.
but tonight after she'd been drinking, it was pretty obvious that she wasn't.
what was she doing? Embarrassing herself.
she was all over camera.
I told him to take her to a stateroom and put her to bed, where she made it worse.
and was that difficult? Did she resist?
no. The opposite, actually.
she thought I wanted to sleep with her.
I told her that I couldn't and we argued for a bit, but she was so drunk.
when I left, she was asleep. So, I thought she'd be fine.
and where were you when she went overboard?
I was on the deck with Monique.
and about 20 other people. And I was talking to some investors when...
I wanted to jump in after her.
I did, but the crew... they asked us to let them handle it.
Yeah. She said she couldn't live without me.
and I just thought she was being dramatic, you know?
I never imagined...
I shouldn't have left her alone. Look, this is a...
terrible situation and obviously something we'd prefer to keep quiet.
I know you guys have a job to do, but if there's any way you can, limit who you tell.
we're a growing company, but we're a young company, and, uh, bad publicity is something we just can't afford.
well, we will be as, uh, discreet as we can be.
but thank you for coming forward. I want to see the toxicology report.
Mr. Britten!
Kate? - Yes!
what are you doing here?
I was here for the party until, you know.
you work for the company? No, no. I live in New York now.
I'm an investment banker. We, uh, funded these guys.
well.
I know. Long way from being Rex's babysitter, right?
I'm so sorry. I... I was out of the country when it happened.
I meant to call. I just felt... sure. We hadn't seen each other in so long, I felt weird.
it's okay.
look, I don't suppose you know how long they're going to keep us.
I mean, I'd be happy to help if I saw anything, but I wasn't even outside.
I was coming out of the bathroom when I heard. What happened there?
that's actually how I heard.
Darin, one of the guys who owns the company... yeah.
he was totally freaked. He was running down the hallway, yelling that someone had jumped and slammed into me and spilled his wine.
I've had a long day. I'd just love to go back to my hotel.
sure. Well, let me, uh, let me ask a couple of questions, see what the situation is, and I promise I'll try and get you out of here as soon as I can, okay?
all right, thank you. All right.
all right. Bye.
aren't you gonna introduce me?
absolutely not. Don't even turn around. - But she looks...
she's a babysitter... - Don't even turn your head.
name's Charlie Simmons.
he had quite a reputation as a professional partier... Drugs, girls, full-time fun.
depends on your idea of fun, I suppose. Can you give us a minute, please.
neighbor said he heard something that sounded like a gunshot, but figured it was just another one of Charlie's parties, so he didn't call it in.
housekeeper came in this morning and found him as such.
look like he's been pretty much executed. Check out the fingers...
he's not gonna be playing the ukulele in heaven. Charlie definitely had a rough night.
come on. Let me show you why.
so they tied him up, go after a couple of fingers, get the combination, take whatever's in there out, and decide they don't need a witness.
we have any idea what was in there? - Nope.
s. I.D.'s gonna get back to us.
well, it's behind a panel. Maybe they knew it was here.
so let's start figuring out which of Charlie's friends was close enough to know he had a safe...
that's gonna take a while. Charlie had a lot of friends.
look at this. See the handle on the safe?
it's all marked up. - Yeah.
I'm saying, before they got the combination from Charlie, this idiot thought they could hammer their way in.
we're not looking for a genius. I can narrow it down even more.
alarm company says that Charlie set the alarm that night, but it was shut off 20 minutes before the murder by someone who entered a guest code.
so Charlie knew his killer?
likely. - All right.
let's find out how many people had guest codes. I know of one so far.
it was a shame. I mean, he could be such a nice man...
when he was himself. And when he wasn't himself?
well, it was the drugs. They made him angry.
did he ever take that out on you? No. Actually, the parties worked out okay for me.
Mr. Simmons would feel so guilty about the state the house was in, he paid me extra when I came to clean.
where were you Saturday night? Playing bingo.
till what time?
like, around midnight. I was with my niece.
she won $200. Nice.
we'll gonna need to speak to her. Okay. Of course.
this is the, uh, code you use for the alarm to get into the house when you're cleaning it for Mr. Simmons? Yes.
do you know who else had access to it? His stepbrother, Mark.
now he would stay sometimes and watch the house when Charlie was out of town, but, well, they haven't talked in a long time, so I don't know if he still had the code or not. Why not? Why aren't they talking?
something to do with Charlie's father dying,
I think. Anybody else you can think of?
girlfriends, ex-girlfriends?
they were not good together. Where would we find this Amber?
she's some kind of actress. Lives in Hollywood.
here it is.
what do you want? We're with the LAPD.
we need to ask you some questions. What for?
Kate... it's me. It's Michael Britten.
you used to babysit my son Rex.
when did this happened? We found him yesterday.
it wasn't an OD? No. He was murdered.
what about you and Mr. Simmons?
how did you meet? We met at a party.
he said he liked my work in some film.
it was a terrible film, but I think he actually meant it.
and, we started dating or something.
or something?
guys like Charlie... They're just sort of looking for younger girls to have around.
they take care of you, buy you nice things.
he let me move in. When was this?
a little under a year. But he cut me loose about a month ago.
what happened? He went to rehab.
he dropped out after a week, but that was it.
not that I blame him. I mean, we were both a mess by the end.
all we did was get high together.
and what have you been doing since?
well, I've been looking for work.
I signed with a new agent, and he's got some things lined up.
where were you on Saturday night?
where were you on Saturday night?
in the ER.
I passed out in a club.
the cops didn't know what to do with me, so they took me to the hospital. Let me sleep it off.
I have the discharge papers if you want them. That would be great.
sure. - Okay.
hold on.
what can you tell me about Mr. Simmons' stepbrother Mark?
not much. He's some, uh... Rocky wannabe.
always in training or something.
they weren't speaking when Charlie and I started hanging out.
he came over once with some papers Charlie had to sign.
he didn't like me very much. Why is that?
he thought I was part of Charlie's problems.
Kate, what are you using? Nothing.
right now.
I know a really good program and I know the people there pretty well.
why don't you let me help you get you in there.
believe it or not, I was doing just fine 20 minutes ago when I'd forgotten you existed.
I don't need your help, Mr. Britten. I just need you to leave.
seeing this woman Kate in reality, and then dreaming about her where her life has unraveled, what comes to mind?
I don't know. Things...
well, things are, obviously, they're different.
you've created different versions of everything in order to protect yourself from the discovery that this is reality.
the fact that this Kate person shows up in the world in which you see Rex proves that that's a dream.
how?
would you have dreamt of running into someone you haven't seen for ten years, and then the very next day she just happens to show up in reality?
isn't it far more reasonable that you ran into her here in reality first, on the boat, and then your mind carried her over into your dream?
you said that Kate was Charlie's girlfriend, right?
Yeah.
so I'm willing to bet that there's something in the house, a-a picture, some mail, something that you subconsciously noted that drew Kate to your mind, and you called her to life in your dream.
that picture isn't real. You went back and placed it in your dream to try to continue to spin endlessly on the question of where Kate appeared first.
every time the answers become clear, you try to find ways to cover them up.
I think what's more relevant to the question of which Kate is real, is why you're seeing her in one world and reflecting her so differently in the other.
I don't know.
it's not like she's...
well, either of them aren't particularly central to either case.
well, is it possible that these diverging Kates have less to do with the cases you're working on, and more to do with Rex?
Rex? Yeah, think about it.
Kate was someone who used to take care of Rex.
maybe her appearance in both worlds is telling you something about the difficulty you're having connecting with Rex.
guess who I ran into yesterday.
who? - Kate.
babysitter Kate? - Yeah.
she was, like, the Rex whisperer. He loved her.
he did, didn't he?
if Rex had a tantrum or he was moody, she would make this amazing paper airplane.
it could, like, stay in the air for five minutes. Rex would stand there and watch it make these wide, lazy loops, and forget anything that was bothering him.
I'm pretty sure I put one in his scrapbook.
where did you run into Kate? I took her statement.
she was, she was at a party where something happened.
I always wondered what happened to Kate. I think she did good.
she's some big cheese investment banker in New York now.
good for her. Yeah.
I'd heard she struggled with loss of her sister.
her sister died? Yeah.
I told you that when it happened.
it was awful. It was some freak surfing accident in Mexico.
I completely forgot. Yeah, she went through a really rough time.
something must have really turned her around.
she's like the Rex whisperer. She would make this amazing paper airplane.
it could, like, stay in the air for five minutes.
I'm pretty sure I put one in his scrapbook.
what are you doing? You don't remember this?
these little planes... You used to make 'em with Kate.
found it in the scrapbook. Kate?
your babysitter Kate. You remember her?
kind of. Not really.
I was, like, five.
I talked to Cole's parents last night. They called you?
no, I called them.
it's been two days, and you haven't apologized to Cole.
I will. When?
soon. Soon isn't good enough.
dad, I have a Spanish test first period, and you've been telling me to get my grade up.
can we not do this now?
Charlie and I we're never been close.
but we did okay until his dad Ben died, my stepdad.
Ben and I... We just clicked.
he and my mother... they got divorced about five years ago so it wasn't like he had to hang out with me.
we just got close. And what happened after he died?
I've been trying to get into UFC fighting, for a few years, and Ben's been staking me.
he was paying for my trainers, giving me an allowance to live on so I could focus on the fighting.
but when he died, Charlie got everything.
he just couldn't wait to cut me off. You two have words about that?
I went down to him, I said, "look, this is what Ben and I were into.
maybe you and I get something going." He laughed at me.
I figured, all right, it's his call.
when I started seeing where all Ben's money was going, to the big parties with the hookers and the drugs...
meanwhile, I'm struggling to get a job so I can stay in my apartment.
so I sued him.
how did that go? Got dropped.
I had a decent attorney file the papers, but I couldn't afford him after that, and...
after a while, I just gave up and moved on. When was all this?
maybe two months ago. Saturday night... Where were you?
I was here training. I had a match early the next morning. Why?
can anybody confirm that you were here?
no. I was here training by myself.
all right, thanks.
that was the D. A. Just went through the father's will.
victim was next in line.
in the event that anything happened to him, guess where the assets go.
to Mr. MMA himself, Mark Hudson.
exactly. So he kills his stepbrother, tries to make it look like an amateur robbery, hence the hammer marks on the safe handle, and he's all set.
we go search his place?
he's got a brain in his head, then he's gotten rid of the gun by now.
if we find a fingerprint or a fiber at the house, he'll say it's from a previous visit.
so how do we put him in Charlie's house on Saturday night?
?????? We go play detective.
so how's it going with Rex? I don't know. I can't get a word out of him.
can't even get an opening. Don't you find that ironic?
I mean, here you are, this big-time detective, you can get killers to turn, but you can't get two words from your own kid?
what is it? We're with the LAPD.
we'd like to ask you some questions about an incident at your neighbor's, Charlie Simmons.
I already told the officers I didn't hear or see anything unusual.
we're following up on information about a particular individual and a vehicle that we think may have been in the neighborhood that night.
if we could have a couple of minutes, please, sir.
hold the pictures up for the camera. I can tell you in two seconds.
there you go. Nope. Sorry.
didn't see either. Is that it?
think that thing can see the street from here? Yeah.
sir, is your camera linked to any kind of recording device? Yeah. Why?
open up please or we'll get a warrant.
your security system just became evidence in a murder investigation.
sleepyhead.
I was gonna let you sleep in, but Efram's on the phone.
he said you'd want me to wake you up. Thanks.
I'm making French toast. What's up?
banks called. Said he got the blood work back on our jumper.
thought we could meet over there. All right.
I'll call you when I'm on my way. All right.
we found a pretty large amount of a benzodiazepine in her blood, along with the alcohol. Probably something like alprazolam.
medical records show she had a prescription. So Cameron tells her the affair is off.
because?
because he realized he's engaged to a lingerie model.
she gets drunk, eats a bottle of her pills and jumps in the ocean. Sounds pretty suicidal to me.
Yeah, well, with everything floating through her system, my guess is she would've been sluggish enough to drown in a kiddie pool.
so, we're calling it? We recovered her phone, right?
it was in her purse? Yeah. We went through it, but nothing jumped out.
let's go through it again. Why?
because something should've jumped out. Great. Thanks.
I-I'll call you if I have any more questions. No, no, you were very helpful.
so that was the last of Annie Yang's five most contacted friends according to her phone records, and not one of them had any indication from her she was having an affair with Cameron Fuller.
well, having an affair with your boss isn't exactly something you advertise.
I mean, it's supposed to be kept a secret.
Yeah, well, apparently she kept it a secret from herself, 'cause I've read all the texts to Fuller, all the texts from Fuller;
??????
there's nothing other than completely professional communication.
maybe she erased the juicy ones. Everyone knows texting is how you get caught.
everyone? Everyone my age.
why would Fuller make it up?
lie to the cops and ruin his life?
maybe to give us a reason why she might have jumped and stop us looking for a reason why she might have been pushed.
there's a totally obvious reason why she would have jumped and no evidence that she didn't, but you're not ready to make the call.
all right, well, if you're so sure it's an open-and-shut case, why don't you stay here and erase some of your juicy texts?
where are you going? I'm going to Annie Yang's apartment.
Vega. Anything?
there are some pictures of Annie and Fuller. Together?
no, just some group shots from work.
anything else... e-mails?
they all look professional, but for all we kw they could have set up dummy e-mail accounts or deleted everything as soon as they got it.
sure.
I'm telling you,
I've seen people do some serious stuff to hide an affair.
look, you're the senior detective and I'm the rookie, but we've been here for hours and we've torn this place apart.
not only do we not have anything, we don't even know what we're looking for.
so don't take this the wrong way, but how much longer do we do this?
just give me a minute. Where are you going?
what are you looking for? I have no idea.
men's shaving cream.
well, there's your evidence she was sleeping with someone.
a safety deposit key.
all right. Let's get another warrant.
what is it? It's some kind of research document.
the real question is, why does a personal assistant have company documents in a safety deposit box, and why does she feel the need to hide the key in a can of shaving cream?
I don't know, but I'd still like to know what made you look under that sink.
when you've been doing the job as long as I have, sometimes you just have to follow your instincts.
all right, let's get this stuff to Len, see if he can make head or tail of it.
all right, thanks. He says they're materials research papers.
why would she tuck them away?
apparently the company found some way to manufacture silicon chips at a fraction of the normal cost, and all the funds they've raised over the past year were to get this off the ground.
these papers show it wasn't working.
so I'm guessing she confronted her boss... lover... Fuller...
and asked him why he was hiding this from the investors, and suddenly he's got a reason to toss her overboard or make it look like she jumped.
except Fuller was in front of 20 people on the deck of the boat when she went over, so...
well, the research papers weren't just bad for him.
they were bad for the whole company. Okay.
so he had help.
do you recognize that woman?
she's one of our bankers... Kate something.
Kate Porter? Right.
she says that seconds after Ms. Yang went overboard, you bumped into her in the corridor, spilled a drink on her dress.
that ring a bell? I-I don't know.
I mean, I-I remember yelling, someone had jumped.
I was panicked. Do you remember what the drink was?
no, I-I honestly don't.
because we had the, the stain tested.
it was red wine.
with traces of a benzodiazepine called alprazolam.
which is exactly what the toxicology report said was found in Ms. Yang's system when they fished her out of the water.
even if you could prove my client was carrying that drink, so what?
he could have picked it up anywhere.
even if you could prove he gave it to her, he could have been trying to calm her down.
right, that sounds likely. Doesn't it?
I got your partner in the other room, and he knows what you did up in that stateroom.
well, he was part of making up the whole story with you and, uh, putting on that wonderful performance on the night.
if you think that he's going to keep quiet, take the rap rather than save himself, then you keep hiding behind this slick-talking young man here, but if you want to trade the truth for any kind of leniency...
now is your time.
here's what I can do. I can tell the D. A. you cooperated.
that could change your life. But it's up to you.
you help us close this case, tell the truth, tell us what we need to hear, and maybe you might end up in a minimum security facility.
I liked her. I did.
she was with me from the start. She believed in me.
when she found out about the research results, she just said we should come forward.
she wasn't threatening anyone. I told Darin, and he...
look, you have to understand, he's been my partner since college, okay?
I just had some ideas. He turned them into a business.
settled all the problems. Like Annie?
Yeah.
he talked to her the morning of the boat party, and he offered her money, but she wouldn't take it.
so...
he came up with the boat idea and...
and the affair story. Who came up with the drugs?
he did. And then who gave them to her?
you? - No.
no, I...
Darin.
we combed the security footage on the block for the six hours before and after the murder.
mark Hudson's truck? - Yeah?
never showed up.
but I did find a car that I thought just didn't look right in the neighborhood.
well, people who live in these big homes, they hire a lot of help.
except the timing in and out of the neighborhood matches the murder exactly.
did we run the plate?
Yeah, belongs to a Katherine Porter.
I told you, I was in the ER. Until 9: 00.
Charlie Simmons was murdered two hours later. Well, I went home after that.
I can't believe you think...
Mr. Britten, tell him that I didn't do this, please.
you're telling me you didn't go to Charlie's house that night?
no. - You're sure about that?
I think I know where I was. Okay.
then help me out here.
cause that must be your car driving itself.
please, Mr. Britten. I used to take care of Rex.
you know me.
I do know you. And that's why...
I don't want you to make this any harder on yourself than it already is.
if you tell the truth,
I promise you I will do whatever I can to help you.
okay? Kate?
it wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Liam was just going to...
he was just supposed to take the money.
who's Liam? Liam Tell.
he's some guy I know who knows some other guys.
what kind of guys? Is he a dealer?
I was broke, and I hadn't had a hit in like a week, and I...
I thought I was losing my mind, and I knew that Charlie kept a lot of cash in his house, so I gave... I gave Liam the alarm code.
but I swear, he said he was just going to go in and scare Charlie...
and get him to open the safe.
this wasn't supposed to happen.
I'm so sorry.
you said that Kate lost her sister, yes? This way.
Yeah.
she drowned.
and from that one loss, you've imagined her life going in two very different directions.
thank you.
what do you make of that?
it's like everything else.
things are different, but...
equally plausible.
so, if you find it just as realistic that a tragedy can strengthen someone or destroy them, what I'm wondering is what you think makes it go in one direction or the other.
how did it come to this? I don't know.
for a long time, I couldn't stop thinking about that day.
there was a big storm, big waves.
we both grabbed our boards and rushed to get into it.
but when we got there...
my sister got nervous and said that maybe we should sit it out.
but I talked her into it.
the waves were horrible. The riptides were vicious.
we both... fell.
we lost track of each other and...
that was it.
and for a long time, I was so angry at myself and at the world.
I didn't see the point in anything.
and it's not like people didn't want to help.
it's just that when a thing like that happens, you don't know how to let them.
I skipped work. I didn't talk to my friends.
my mom kept trying to get me back out there, telling me it would make me feel better.
but I kept telling her that that was the point. I didn't want to feel any better.
eventually, she just let me be.
after that, I started finding my own ways to deal with the pain.
she just wouldn't let me be.
I don't know how my mom did it.
I mean, she was just as sad and hurt as I was.
somehow she had the strength to not only stay on her feet, but to get me back on mine.
and she must have tried a thousand times to get me back into my life, and I just kept saying no.
I guess I'm lucky that she was willing to try a thousand and one.
we have to talk about what happened.
again?
well, you haven't really told me anything.
not really. Cole broke my racquet.
I got mad.
end of story.
he broke a couple of strings.
come on.
why would you go after him like that? He's your best friend.
forget it. Doesn't matter.
it does matter.
it matters to me.
look.
I know you're going through a lot. I know it isn't easy for you.
I get that.
now, I don't expect you to tell me every little thing that's going through your head, but you have to talk to me because I'm all you've got.
and I'm not going anywhere.
I'm right here. I'm your father, and I love you.
Cole shouldn't have used my racquet. He says he'll fix it.
he can't fix it. - Why not?
because it was mom's.
I never used it; I just...
I liked to keep it in my bag.
made me feel... like something.
now it's gone. Well, he didn't know.
I know. I know that.
he wants to be nice. Everybody wants to be nice.
but I can't help it, okay?
I think about mom...
and I just get angry all over again.
well...
you know, it's okay to be angry.
I get pretty angry, too, sometimes.
slow down, damn you!
you're scaring my dog!
quit texting and learn to drive, a-hole!
you hit me, douchebag! Ouch. You punk!
rapture kit, ten bucks.
I'll wing it.
how about a buck? Wait... Tire iron!
okay. - Stupid city.
they have an incredible law library.
I love all the faculty I've met. And I'm telling you, Oregon's amazing!
it's, like, 70 degrees, sunny... you're not gonna win a weather war, sweetie.
it's 70 degrees and sunny every day here in L. A. Yeah, no, no.
but when I tell you it's beautiful, it's, like, seriously beautiful.
I mean, you can actually see mountains, and the sky's blue, not some brown or gray.
and the trees... The trees are incredible.
come on, we...
we have trees. It's not, like, a contest.
I'm just saying it's really nice.
Yeah, the grass is always greener.
Yeah, well, I'm telling you, the grass actually greener here.
what the hell's going on?
it says they've got, like, three blocks closed.
what for? They're filming something.
maybe we should take the freeway.
it says the freeway's worse.
how can it be worse than not moving?
maybe you go backwards.
captain wants to know why we don't have any suspects in those cases.
cause my psychic powers are failing me.
maybe we should take out a billboard: "Stop killing each other till we catch up, signed... the police.
PS: "Leave more evidence.
you want to grab a bite?
no. I think I'm gonna head up to the park.
the park?
Yeah. - What for?
go for a run. - A run?
Yeah. I want to look at something beautiful.
we got views in this city, right? That's why we live here.
hell if I know.
not bad.
this stupid city.
so tell me how this works.
I'm awake with my wife, and I close my eyes.
I open them. I'm awake with my son.
and this has been happening since the accident?
so you begin working on one case here in reality, and then, suddenly, you begin working another case there in your dream.
it all feels completely real to me.
you can't tell whether you're awake or asleep at this very moment?
well, I can assure you, Detective Britten, this is not a dream.
that's exactly what the other shrink said.
these're all of them? 1999 to last year.
every one gets a vertical slash down the wrist.
after they bleed out, a postmortem Roman numeral two carved into their torso.
you got all pairs... Two in Minneapolis,
Nashville, Buffalo, Philadelphia, Lincoln, Ann Harbor, Dallas, and then, year later, L. A. Last night.
vic disappeared yesterday.
we got no witness, nothing from forensics yet.
if you ignore the fact Gemini is dead, this fits his pattern to a tee.
so, what, either he's been resurrected and is leaving bodies in Griffith Park or someone found his work inspirational enough to copy.
you know, the Gemini always killed his second victim within 48 hours and left it in a paired location.
two cars in Nashville, two bathrooms in Dallas.
so this victim turns up in a park.
if the copycat's as good as he looks, there'll be another one in another park.
well, there's what, 70, 000 acres of parkland in L. A.?
are you suggesting that we shut it all down?
well, we got to do something.
maybe beef up patrols the next couple of days, put K9 units on the entrances and exits.
done. Who's getting the Fed? Why are they sending someone?
I asked for forensics on the previous cases.
FBI told me an agent would be on the next plane. Ask for an e-mail, they book a plane ticket.
got to love the government. Who do you work for, Google?
look, I'm just asking you to help me out.
she's my daughter, too.
what do you want me to do, Elizabeth? Bribe her?
I can't force her to get on the phone.
did she at least get the package? Why do you do this to yourself?
you know she's trying to hurt you.
I got to go.
I'll call you back. Divorce sucks.
you are Detective Britten, right?
Yeah. - Elizabeth Santoro.
good to meet you. Did you bring the case file?
Yeah. It's in the car. Shall we?
as copycats go, your guy's pretty good.
you're positive it's a copycat?
am I positive? Just asking.
how many cases have you had in the last 12 years, Detective Britten?
I don't know... hundreds.
well, I've had one. The Gemini killer.
you know what they give you after 12 years on one case?
no. - Book deal.
so, ever since last may, I've been sitting in a cabin in Portland trying to get the last 12 years down on paper, hoping that when the hardcover comes out, it'll seem worth it.
the short and soon-to-be declassified answer will be on page 27
if anybody ever reads the stupid book.
which is? No two-dollar bill.
two-dollar bill?
Gemini always left a two-dollar bill in the hand of his victims.
you know, two... Gemini twin sign.
we kept it from the press to separate imitators and false confessors from the real thing.
did you guys find a two-dollar bill I don't know about?
no.
there you go. Copycat.
that's the other unfortunate consequence of spending 12 years on one particular sicko.
you're the person they get out of bed every time another one turns up.
still, it gets me out of Portland for a while.
I hear it's nice up there.
who told you that? All it ever does is rain.
imagine London, but full of hippies.
you coming in? I have something to sort out.
I'll see you up there.
so did you meet Santoro? Meet her?
she's not there ten minutes, and she's already telling us we're looking for a disgruntled white dude, middle to lower middle class.
based on what exactly? She don't say.
these profilers, man, they're just a cut below psychics.
they make these broad generalizations that apply to almost anybody, then congratulate themselves for being right no matter what turns up.
I had no idea it was such a sore point for you.
well, let's just say I've been accidentally pulled over enough to know that there's a difference between a profile and a suspect.
is this it?
this it right here? - No, no.
browner, pointier. Muttier.
look, I'm just saying real cops don't sit back and theorize about whether a suspect likes bingo or eats cornflakes.
I mean, we pound the pavement.
we work the dog biscuits, baby.
here, boy. Here, boy. Here's a good boy.
tasty. Come on. Come to daddy.
you guys should keep him after the sedation wears off.
help cheer this place up. Yeah, morgue mascot.
just what we need.
you know, this little jerk tried to bite my finger off earlier.
you know, gastric lavage on an anesthetized dog... Not my job.
I owe you one. - Yeah, you do.
that said...American currency has plastic security threads woven into the paper.
makes them hard to digest.
it's a little ragged, but... There's no question...
that's a two- dollar bill.
this does not mean it's the Gemini.
it just means the copycat is someone who had access to classified information about the case.
if anything, it helps us narrow our profile to someone who's probably in or was let go from law enforcement.
can we get records of any LAPD recently fired, demoted or laid off?
and anybody with a psychiatric history.
we'll go through them, start a canvass asap.
maybe somebody connects back to our victim. Sound good?
look, look, what if it were the Gemini killer?
the Gemini killer is dead, Detective. I shot him myself.
actually, a man named Arthur Minturn is dead.
now, you're saying he's the Gemini because he fits the profile.
you have no idea what you're talking about.
I'm saying, if you happened to be wrong, then we'd be wasting our time interviewing recently fired cops, when we should be looking for a guy who's been at this for more than a decade.
your call, captain. I'm just here to consult.
all right, pull the files.
Yes, ma'am.
agent.
agent Santoro.
look, all Bird's asking is if there is value in at least considering the possibility that it's not a copycat.
I had no trouble parsing what he was saying.
maybe you had trouble with my answer.
look, I understand the implications.
honestly.
I... I put an innocent man in jail for ten years...
something I have to live with. Mistakes happen.
it's part of the job.
I'm sorry you made a huge mistake, Detective.
I'm sorry if that mistake probably ruined someone's life.
I'm-I'm sorry if it still keeps you up at night.
but I'm here to prevent another victim from appearing on your board tomorrow.
good night.
Hi, this is Hannah Britten, leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
honey, it's me.
listen, I can't find my phone charger, so if you have any idea where it is, could you call me?
even if you don't, you can still call me.
mountain TOP MOVING?????
you're saying you feel lied to?
no, I'm saying that apparently the people at Mountain Top Movers knew she was more serious about this than I did.
how did she give you the impression she wasn't serious?
look, we talked about it.
w- we... she's just visiting. It's not a realistic option.
is that what she's been saying, or is that what you've been hearing?
confirmation bias makes us susceptible to hearing only things that reinforce our opinion, and the more closely held our opinion, the more selective we seem to be about the things that we pay attention to.
I think I know what we've discussed. She never mentioned calling the movers.
trust me.
can we just try something just for a minute?
I want you to try to think about how Hannah would describe her situation.
come on, I'm not going to role-play.
no, you don't have be Hannah per se, but I just want you to try to imagine where she is right now and see if you can articulate how she would describe things from her point of view.
close your eyes. You're kidding me.
please.
fine.
what do you want to know? Tell me what it's like where Hannah is.
it's Oregon.
it's, uh... it's pretty. Mountains, whatever.
do you imagine that Hannah seems happy?
happy?
Yeah, I guess.
and why do you think that is? Because she likes the idea of starting over.
and why is that so appealing?
because it's easier than staying here and dealing with everything.
no, no, that is what you would say.
what would Hannah say?
I guess she...
she would like things to be good again.
and what does that mean?
I don't know. Okay, let me put it this way:
when Hannah imagines things being good again...
are you a part of it?
what do you mean by that?
I guess I'm wondering if your fear is less about the idea of Hannah leaving Los Angeles and more about the idea of Hannah leaving you.
that's way off.
you said that, even before the accident, things were less than ideal between the two of you.
we have discussed the very real fact that a large number of marriages don't survive the loss of a child, and yet you pretend that the idea of your relationship being in jeopardy doesn't even occur to you.
it doesn't have to occur to me, does it?
I got you to point out that my marriage is falling apart.
unfortunately, Detective, the reality is that this is the way most marriages die...
not with epic rounds of screaming matches, not with threats or ultimatums, but with two people who wander slowly away from one another without a word.
they completely forget what it really means to be together until one day, they look up and they discover they're so far apart...
...there's no way back.
I may have a lead on that hancock ark home invasion.
I'm meeting with some guy who says he knows the fence.
I wouldn't mind a second opinion, see if he's for real, unless you're busy.
no, I'm good.
Oregon?
what the hell are you going to do in Oregon?
I don't think I could ever leave L. A. L. A. is perfect.
yeah? - Yeah.
I went out with an actress the other day who asked me to help her memorize lines.
she said the only way that she could get into the part was to strip away everything that wasn't part of the character, so she gets naked and reads a script to me for an hour and a half.
I mean, you cannot find that in Oregon. She read to you?
naked.
you and I have different definitions of "perfect.
wait, hold on.
hold on, hold on, here it is.
I don't understand. It's supposed to be here.
my informant said it was a pawnshop.
who introduced you to this CI? Nobody.
I was on a follow-up. He came right up and said he might know something.
he came up to you? Yeah, he...
well, for a hundred bucks, he said he'd tell me where it was.
what?
wait.
what, why'd you do that? - You just learned a $100 lesson.
if you have to buy it, it may be information.
if they're trying to sell it to you, it's always BS.
I don't suppose the department is going to help me out with that 100 bucks.
think of it as a rookie tax.
mountain TOP MOVING FROM: LA, CA????
Hi, this is Hannah Britten.
leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
the Mudflap Inn?
forensics from Gemini's other cases suggest he liked to set up a base within a two-mile radius of the first kill, get to know the area.
cheap motels with classy names.
the sort of place nobody asks questions if you walk in with blood on your shirt.
exactly.
these are all within a couple miles of Griffith Park.
I figure, we divide and conquer, should take us a couple hours.
we'll ask the questions Santoro doesn't want to, and if it doesn't work out, we'll go do the disgruntled cop interviews, she'll be none the wiser.
Hello, Dr. Dave.
excuse me.
Yeah. Sir.
good morning. Start again?
I'm looking for a man who checked in over the last week...
alone, would have kept himself to himself, paid cash.
you just described pretty much everyone here.
all right, well, let's start last Wednesday and move forward.
would have stayed a couple nights, maybe still here. That I would remember.
see, we deal pretty exclusively in hourly guests.
Yeah, okay. Enjoy the movie.
LAPD!
show me your hands.
show me your hands!
stop!
we've got these at the bottom of sleeping-bag. We probably won't get any prints.
and what about the rest of the room?
well, it's an abandoned building.
it's covered in a hundred different sets of hairs, prints, fibers.
we'll run what we get, but there's no good way to separate wheat from chaff.
I'm sorry. What were you doing in here again?
based on the old cases, we were checking out motels within a two-mile radius of the first murder, seeing if anything popped.
Yeah, but this isn't a motel, so...
well, no, but it's opposite one, and I saw this building, looked like the kind of place somebody might make camp...
well, there are probably six abandoned buildings on this street alone, not to mention all the buildings across from the motels you checked out, any one of which someone could have camped out in.
I'm just trying to understand what specifically brought you in here.
does it matter? This is where the guy was.
there were signs of a forced entry.
lucky you were looking out for that kind of thing.
no, if I was lucky, I would have caught the guy.
and you never saw the suspect at all? Is that right, Detective Bird?
I was at another motel.
how did you guys decide who'd take which motels?
well, we tore a piece of paper in half. You did?
we did.
I did. What's your point?
I just want to make sure I completely understand how we all got here.
but I think I'm up to speed now.
excellent. - Thank you.
so, we've got perimeters set up, we got Metro going door to door.
we're just gonna have to wait and see what sid come up with, okay?
does the bureau have anything to add?
no, that sounds exactly right to me. Good. Thank you.
good night.
excuse me, captain. Can I talk to you for a moment?
it's about Detective Britten.
when I asked you for those files on recently terminated, disgruntled or troubled law enforcement officers, guess who was in the stack?
are you saying that you think Detective Britten is the suspect?
I'm saying that for someone the department has chosen to keep an eye on, Detective Britten seems to have developed a pretty incredible knack for being in the right place at the right time.
let me go and get Rex, I'll drop him off at home.
I'll be at the station in 30 minutes or less.
all right.
what?
we got a call from someone claiming to be our guy.
when? What did he say?
let's go. I'll play it for you.
Hello, Elizabeth. It's me. I'm wondering which is worse
knowing that a local cop got closer in one day than you did in 12 years, or knowing that someone's going to have to rewrite the end of that book you've been slaving away at?
after all we've been through, you were really going to credit someone else for my work?
I thought we were closer than that.
that's it? Short.
did not have any luck with the trace? Yeah.
it took some work, but he was able to follow it back to its originating number.
you recognize that number, Detective Britten?
Yeah. It's mine.
did we send a team? - We did.
we just need your consent to let them in. Absolutely. Let's go.
no. Hang on.
Wh-where have you been for the last hour?
where have I... been? I went to go home, and I had to go... Why does it matter?
no one else in Los Angeles knows about that book, Detective.
you... you don't actually think that I made this call?
look, no one is making any accusation...
no, no, she is. No.
we're just trying to put it all together.
captain, Gemini either is or was standing in my living room.
Gemini is dead, Detective.
you're sticking with that? Even after everything we've found?
what have we found? You're out running, you happen to find a body, which you point out meets all the publicly available work of a dead serial killer.
then you get dispatched to follow a set of leads, and instead, you take your partner off in one direction, - While you, alone again, - My son is home in a few hours. Go into a building, seemingly chosen at random
can we go? From all the other buildings along your route, and lucky again, you find the killer.
then after he gets away, the killer drops us a line, congratulating you on your good work.
and of all the phones in the world he could use, he uses yours.
do you think if it was me, I would be dumb enough to make a call from my own house?
I think you think you're smart enough to use a phone, you think wouldn't be traceable.
if this was guy was at my house, then somehow, he's redirected the call to make it look like it came from my house.
either way, he's got you two wasting your time looking at me, the only person who's made any headway in the case, while he's free to pick out a second victim.
all right, let's talk about victims. That guy you found in the park?
turns out he's got a lengthy rap sheet for child abuse and sex offenses. So what?
I wonder, if you were a cop losing his marbles, if that's the kind of guy you might like to see disappear.
all right, all right, you know what? That's enough.
detective Britten, do we have your consent - to search your home and your car? - Yes.
can we go? - You are not going anywhere.
you're running out of time!
then go and do it. Be aware of this fact:
that while you're pawing through my drawers, trying to find a way to tie me in, he's out there free and clear, ready to deliver another body.
I drove down that street, Detective.
there were at least four buildings that look like someone might have been squatting there. Why did you choose that one?
why did you choose the Mountain Top Moving & Storage building over all of them?
I told you.
I know.
and now I'm telling you, I need your weapon.
where the hell have you been? I'm sitting here an hour.
I don't hear a word from you.
you don't answer the phone, nothing.
I was making sure Rex didn't come home while the SID team was tearing your place apart.
so what are you thinking?
you know what I'm thinking, Mike.
I'm thinking I don't know why you went in that building either.
I'm thinking that ever since you came back, you have been different;
that we don't work as a team the way we used to.
you playing hunches that you either can't or won't explain.
you tell me you're going one way, you go the other.
and then when I ask you about it, you say something thin and try to make it sound like I'm going crazy.
so you think I had something to do with this?
if I thought you had something to do with it,
I wouldn't be here. I'm just saying don't pretend things are how they used to be.
now, uh... they won't let me take anything from the evidence room. Best I can do are these photos.
if you can pull a rabbit out the hat, now's the time.
Thanks.
we get any prints back from these food items here?
nothing that came up in the database.
a few partials, they don't all match.
who knows how many people handled that stuff?
all right, here we go.
this napkin, you recognize that logo?
no, it's a napkin.
some place with food. Gemini killer has to eat, right?
can we get nat to do an image search... please?
napkin, mugs...
you can go online and get a T-shirt with that thing on it, okay?
six locations.
so we got Pasadena, Culver City, South Bay, Venice, Brentwood, Malibu.
they're all miles away from the storage place.
Yeah, all in proximity to a park.
so, he gets a coffee while stalking his second victim?
maybe.
even if we pull all the units off the other parks and concentrate on these six, we're still talking hundreds of acres.
we're missing something.
you have the pictures of the first murder.
holy...
what? In the background.
look at Santoro's cup.
she had that with her when I picked her up in Brentwood.
okay. The Brentwood location is in the lobby of the Meridian Hotel.
which is where she's staying.
Hi, you got my voice-mail. - You know what to do.
I know you're not calling me back, but I'm just gonna keep leaving you messages, 'cause I'm your mom and I love you and one of these days, you're gonna appreciate that I kept trying.
agent Santoro? - Yeah.
you've reached special agent Elizabeth Santoro.
please leave a message after the beep. She's not picking up.
come on.
okay, put out an attempt to locate on agent Santoro.
we need all units to respond to Temescal Canyon Park.
nobody goes in or out. What are you doing, Bird?
he can't be out of there.
sorry, sir, park's closed tonight. Why do you think I'm here?
keep your eyes open in there. Always.
anybody come in or go out?
just the FBI guy. 743. Officer needs...
damn it, follow us.
Elizabeth, did you really think Minturn was me, or did you just...
want it to end?
to see you try to tell the world
I'd failed, I'd lost...
do you have any idea how troubling that was?
it's okay.
it's okay, it's okay.
is that what you think? That I want to go without you?
well, why didn't you tell me you'd called the movers?
cause I'm embarrassed.
I'm embarrassed that I want this.
that I, that I need it.
that...
when I got off the phone with the moving company, or when I got off the plane in Oregon,
I felt...
I felt hope like I haven't been able to for a long time.
I don't know how you do it.
I wish I could be as strong as you.
that's just something you have that I don't.
I know... you think that...
I just want to run away, but I don't.
I don't want to forget him.
the part of Rex that I want to remember is right here.
every time I look at you, I see our son.
I see who we were when we were with him.
and what I dream we could be again.
you think I want to leave that behind?
you're crazy.
so, you would move?
if that's what she needs, I'll make it work.
but you and Rex, you would stay here.
Yeah, he lives here, he goes to school here.
he has his friends and tennis, and he doesn't want to move.
what?
I don't want to give the wrong impression.
I think this represents progress.
imagine that.
I just fear that this progress is gonna be more painful than you seem to understand.
come on, check out that view.
two bedrooms.
and they say it backs up to a nature preserve.
I think that your ability to maintain these two worlds relies heavily on the fact that they're largely the same.
the visual priming that takes place as you move through this world helps you form the other.
what are you doing? Just enjoying the view.
look at that. It's beautiful.
I think you're just gassed, and you're afraid to admit it.
yeah?
catch me.
but if your worlds are completely different, these connections will erode, and eventually,
I think one will begin to seem more and more like what it is.
a fantasy.
so you think if I am in two different places, one of them will fall apart?
dreams are our way of processing reality.
if you move, you're processing an entirely different world.
living in Oregon, your mind will eventually have to let go of L. A.
but understand I think that this is a good thing.
in your dream, you're beginning to recognize, to wrestle with the fact that there comes a point at which you have to move on.
now, you'll fight it, which is natural.
it's healthy, even.
but sooner or later,
I think you'll let go.
see, you talk about me like I'm something you've studied for or read in a textbook, but you don't know.
no, this thing works because I make it work.
and nothing's gonna change that.
I won't let it.
this is Britten. Hello, Detective.
who is this?
you know, it's very strange.
for 12 years, no one's even come close, and then in 48 hours, you and I run in to each other twice.
I became terribly curious.
just who is this man?
and what could be his secret?
so, I paid a visit to your therapist's office.
and now I understand.
can you really not tell if you're awake or asleep?
I bet they've told you that you're crazy.
that you need help.
that you need to get well.
you see, that's the thing about guys like you and me.
there's no other way for us to be.
you take away what makes us us, and what's left?
no, don't let them do that to you.
the world needs a few of us to see it...
sideways.
sweet dreams, Detective Britten.
and speaking just for myself,
I'd be very disappointed if you woke up.
ladies and gentlemen, flight 402 to Portland is boarding in ten minutes.
Gabriel Wyath, 26.
engineering student... diagnosed about five years ago.
delusions began to grow increasingly vivid and violent, eventually requiring hospitalization.
Gabe has successfully masked his issues for so long that by the time that anyone was aware of the extent of his problems, his delusions had convinced him to try and blow up a government building.
so what are we looking for when we make a diagnosis of schizophrenia?
well, many patients develop a routine to help them maintain the illusion of control.
double Americano. Extra shot. Skim milk.
extra hot. Thanks.
black coffee?
despite this, they outwardly exhibit disorganized or odd behavior.
I don't think that's what I ordered.
which can lead to confusion and agitation.
where did you put the Alderman file?
who the hell is Alderman?
see?
right where I said it was.
they might suffer from coexisting sleep disorders, including insomnia.
the majority of cases become unstable without medication.
good.
the issue lies in what happens when a patient refuses treatment.
many will endure confusion, anger and risk harm to themselves and others, all in an effort to cling to things that only they see and understand.
that's what makes these patients so dangerous.
the delusions that drive them also convince them to try to hide the depth of their problems.
our challenge is to...
try to find a way to help someone who doesn't want it.
the risk lies in...
the damage they can do if we fail.
so tell me how this works.
I'm awake with my wife, and I close me eyes, I open them... I'm awake with my son.
and this has been happening since the accident?
so you began working on one case here in reality, and then suddenly you begin working another case there, in your dream.
it all feels completely real to me.
you can't tell whether you're awake or asleep at this very moment?
well I can assure you, Detective Britten, this is not a dream.
that's exactly what the other shrink said.
dad, the school says they don't have the permission slip.
you told me you turned it in.
how am I not the account holder if my name is on the bill?
n-no, don't put me...
I gave it to the teacher, the guy with the... thing on his head... I'll call him.
you can't call. They had to be cleared last week.
and I'm sorry, I'll take you to museum myself... how's that?
it's not about the museum. It's about the fact that now I have to spend the day in study hall because you didn't turn in a simple piece of paper.
I'm telling you, I'm pretty sure I gave...
the guy something, unless I gave him the phone bill.
well, no, no, no. I'm talking to my son. Don't, don't...
listen, how could it take you three days to switch the service back on when you have my money today?
hold on a second.
yeah?
I'm on my way.
Hello?
Hello?
all right. You ready to go? I told you yesterday, Cole's dad is taking me.
I'll text you when I'm out. - No, you won't.
your phone's not gonna be on for three days.
What?! It's gonna be back on on Wednesday.
the phone company messed up. I'm sorry.
those prints come back? You asking me, Detective?
Mike, glad you could make it. Len's waiting on us; the prints came back.
Really?
they originally made it for the astronauts.
I'm telling you, I sleep like the dead in this thing.
I'm not spending half my pension on a mattress.
half?
we're talking about an astronaut bed, man.
I'm pretty sure I spent my whole pension and probably a little of yours.
what?
well, first of all, there's coffee in it. Look, Len...
I dropped the thing, okay?
no. There's also a ring missing. - What?
Yeah, there's one...
two-fingered brass knuckle ring, with the word "WILD" inscribed on the top.
look. No, no, no, no.
see, I picked everything up and put it all back in here. I made sure.
this is why I tell them not to let you guys take it out of the property room.
do me a favor... it's a ten-cent knockoff. It's got nothing to do with the crime.
could you do some... Lenny magic, make it disappear?
just don't do it again. Okay?
I owe you a large beer, my friend. - Y-You owe me a ring.
never should've got out of bed this morning.
you know, I had that same feeling, but it's 'cause I was very comfortable.
that astronaut bed... ooh.
come on...
I wasn't the one who was too tired last night.
just eight minutes of your precious time.
eight minutes? It takes me eight minutes to get these clothes on.
six. No. You're going the wrong direction.
how about 12 minutes and a police escort?
and that is my final offer.
how about lunch?
lunch? - Yeah.
sure. All right.
but tomorrow we stay in bed all day. Deal?
deal.
there was totally a sign there, and you blew right through it. There was no sign.
let's go back. - I'm eating.
because you know it was a stop sign. No.
when we get to the station, I'm gonna write you a ticket.
all units, Code 3. Possible hostage situation.
Vista Psychiatric Hospital. 11347 Vista Heights.
seven William 43 and 45, responding Code 3.
come on. It's okay. Come.
what's up?
guy claims to have the whole place wired with explosives.
he's got himself barricaded in there with about 15 other patients, doctors and nurses.
we've set up a perimeter and already started evacuation. This is the head nurse in charge.
he is a patient. His name's, uh, Gabriel Wyath.
he just started screaming he was gonna blow the whole place up, and then he locked down the high-risk wing from the inside.
you see these explosives? They look real to you?
he's got a bunch of acetylene tanks with wires sticking out of them.
detective, he's on the phone. - Who?
the patient. He wants to talk to whoever's in charge.
you're the senior officer.
this is Detective Britten.
who am I talking to? It's Gabe. Okay. It's Gabe.
you have to stop the noises. Stop the sirens. Okay?
I can't hear my thoughts and I need to hear what I'm thinking or...
okay, Gabe.
hold on a second. I'll see what I can do.
let's have all units respond Code 2.
seven William 45, have all units respond Code 2.
hold on a second, Gabe.
all right. How's that? Gabe, is that any better?
Yeah.
thank you.
thank you. N-Now, which one are you?
raise your hand.
that's me.
right here. You got me?
I see you. You look okay.
Thanks. All right, Gabe, listen.
here's what I need you to do:
I need you to let all those people you're holding walk out of here.
No! No! Don't, don't... Hold on.
I tell you what I need. Okay? That's how this works. Okay?
that's how it works! Okay? - All right.
all right, Gabe. I'm sorry.
so, what do you need? I need you to bring me my sister.
okay? I know they have her.
I know all about it. Okay?
I-I just need to see her... talk to her. Okay?
I-I just need to... to see her.
all right, Gabe. Give me a little time and...
what did he say? He wants to see his sister.
you know where I can find her? - You can't.
she was murdered about four years ago.
great.
we estimate there are 25 hostages.
he's got them locked behind these sally port doors, here.
here we go. Everyone, this is Dr. Lee.
he's worked with the patient extensively.
we're just trying to get a thumbnail of what we're dealing with here.
well, what we're dealing with is a very intelligent and very troubled individual.
was actually a rising star in a government research lab when his condition started to become apparent.
he lived with his sister, Christy, until four years ago when she was murdered in a dispute with an ex-boyfriend.
Gabe responded to her death by creating an elaborate conspiracy theory in which his sister was not murdered, but abducted by agents from the lab where he used to work.
despite our best efforts, he's... he's grown increasingly delusional.
doctor, bottom line:
is this a guy we're gonna be able to reason with?
as long as he's allowing his actions to be dictated by things only he sees or hears, it's unlikely.
very well.
this is a high security building. Apparently, Gabe has overtaken the command room.
so, he can use all the measures designed to keep the patients in to keep us out.
realistically, we're looking at 12 to 14 hours to try a full breach.
our only immediate option is to try sniping him through the small western window.
but if we're gonna get a clean shot, we're gonna have to maneuver him into position.
the negotiator's trying to work out a trade to get one of our guys inside.
see if we can't...
direct him. - He won't let anyone out, but he's agreed to let someone in that can help him find his sister.
we can work with that. - There's one complication.
he's saying he will only take the officer who helped him with the noise.
detective Britten. - Absolutely not.
how else are you gonna take the shot?
once you're in, ease him toward the west side of the drinking fountain.
that's where we've got the best shot.
excuse me.
honey. Babe.
I know you're gonna think I'm crazy; what if we try that Lebanese place again?
no, I can't.
I know, but they say that the lamb's gotten so much better.
no, no, I mean, a situation came up at work.
I... I got to take a rain check.
how?
okay, well, what about dinner? Dinner would be great.
you know that I love you, right?
Yeah, I love you, too, babe. I'll see you tonight, all right?
see ya.
...not have been evacuated, which all over a dozen people that remain inside this building.
apparently, one officer has been admitted in and is attempting to reason with Wyath.
???? no comment.
we don't know what his demands are.
no stranger though, this man, to this sort of violence, Wyath was arrested in late 2008
when he entered a municipal building with explosives strapped to his body.
shortly after this, he was transferred to the high-security wing of this facility...
this is Detective Michael Britten.
please leave me a message, and I'll call you back as soon as I can.
y-you're not at this hospital scene I'm watching on TV, right?
okay, listen to me... Where is he?
Where's-where's-where's Michael?
we had a situation, and he didn't want you to worry.
my God. My God!
Sh-Show me you're clean.
I got nothing on me, Gabe. Just like you told me.
okay?
so let's stay calm. Just sit down.
what did they tell you?
they told me to come in here and help you find your sister and bring her to see you.
did they tell you that I'm making it up?
because that's how they dismiss you. How they try to get rid of you.
Yeah, they did.
I'm not imagining things.
my sister is real, and she's alive, and whatever they told you, she doesn't deserve this.
she's the only one that ever understood.
when they tried to split us up, take me away because they said that I was sick, that I wanted to hurt people, she wouldn't let them.
she fought them, and instead of letting them haul me off to a place like this...
...she took me to one like this.
she looks nice. She protected me.
I let them take her.
I should have protected her.
and I didn't.
but now I need, I need to get her. I need to get her back.
and that, that's what makes me sick?
don't you think I would be crazy if I wasn't trying to save her?
Yes.
look.
look at this. No! No, no, no! No!
No!
okay. They think that I can't see through this? I mean, but it's practically obvious.
Gabe, can I ask you something?
what is that in your hand? I know you're there!
this? Yeah.
this is a dead man's switch.
it's what triggers the bombs, Detective.
I let go...
boom.
it's how I'm gonna keep them honest.
as long as I don't let go, everything's fine.
but if they try something... No!
No!
excuse me.
this is how we'll find her?
this map?
that's where Dr. Wilde has her.
Dr. Wilde?
two-fingered brass knuckle ring with the word "WILD" inscribed on the top.
he's holding her.
he's got her in this secret underground location.
they think that she's gonna talk about my research, but I keep telling them that she doesn't know anything.
but they won't even admit that they have her.
how can you reason with someone when-when they say that she's not even alive?
right. Will you shut up!
I'm trying to tell him where Christy is!
shut up! Please.
shut up!
shut up!
I said, shut up! - No! No! No!
No!
get away from the window!
sierra One, I have visual on suspect.
you got a green light on the shot.
shut up!
let go! No, Gabe. Calm down.
you tried to kill me! No, no, I'm trying to help you!
the switch... I can pull the wire from the transceiver, and it's the same thing as letting go of the button!
don't-don't do any... - Do you want me to do that?!
no, no, no. Okay, I'm not touching it. - Let go!
get away! Stand up!
all right, let's just calm down, okay? Gabe?
turn around! Okay.
I need you to stay calm, Gabe.
if we're gonna try and help you...
shut up! I can't think!
I can't have you causing this kind of trouble.
all right, let's just slow everything down, okay, Gabe?
Gabe! Let us out of here!
Gabe! Gabe! No!
come over here and talk to me! Gabe, don't!
that'll kill him! Gabe, don't do it!
no, Gabe!
it's me.
that missing ring turn up? The one that said "WILD"?
sorry.
your dad didn't notice you carrying two bowls?
I don't think he would have noticed if I'd had two heads.
he's acting weird lately. Why?
Why? I don't know.
you don't ask?
it's none of my business.
sure it is.
he could be getting fired.
or, I don't know, he has a tumor. Or he could have an eating disorder.
he doesn't have an eating disorder. No?
how would you know if you don't ask?
we just... don't talk about stuff like that.
would you know if your parents had an eating disorder?
totally. We practically tell each other everything.
Yeah?... Where do they think you slept last night?
in your bed.
you're serious.
Yeah.
they practice progressive parenting.
as long as I tell them the truth, they trust me.
they must want to kill me. No.
they'd be more mad at you if they found out you were giving me this.
a lot of processed sugar.
so you're allowed to sleep over at your boyfriend's, but you can't have Cap'n Crunch?
progressive parenting.
see if the cleaning crew found the ring, will you? No need.
guy pled guilty this morning. Case closed.
Really? You sure? Yeah. He took 18 months.
after that, well, I'm sure he'll be a model citizen. There's something wrong there.
we got to find the ring.
need to find it? Why?
I mean, you said yourself it's not important to the case, okay?
we got enough real work here.
I don't need you out there hunting, looking around for cheap jewelry.
now, if you feel bad, you can send the guy a carton of cigarettes.
look, can you ask them to keep looking?
okay, look, I'll ask them, all right?
Mike, you still there?
Yeah. So when you coming in?
no, I, I got to stop and see someone first.
tell me about psychiatric drugs, the kind you inject.
something that might cause hallucinations.
an anesthetic like ketamine, for instance, could have that effect. Why?
the last thing I remember before I woke up this morning, I got shot up with something...
maybe ketamine. I don't understand how...
there's this guy, a mental patient, he's taken some people hostage in a hospital, and I was sent in to diffuse the situation.
he attacked me and injected me with something, and-and...
you mean in your dreams. I don't know what's going on now.
are you experiencing hallucinations?
no.
this ring that you're missing, you said that it wasn't important to the case, and yet you feel compelled to find it. Why?
the guy's looking for a after a Dr. Wilde, and the ring's got "WILD" inscribed on it.
I see.
and this psychiatric patient, what exactly is the nature of his illness?
he's a schizophrenic.
would you say that you're frightened of him?
he's got the building wired to explode, and I'm inside it, so...
you know, so I'm a little bit frightened.
what if I told you that that sounded like a positive step?
I'd say that's not exactly how it feels.
through this missing ring, you have linked yourself with a schizophrenic, a man who's unable to distinguish fantasy from reality.
but in this situation you've created, your own well-being depends on neutralizing him, on defeating him.
and on some level, that means that you've acknowledged the danger presented when someone refuses to see things for what they are.
you're saying I'm dreaming to tell myself to stop dreaming?
I'm saying, right now, it's a missing ring, it's a permission slip, it's a phone bill.
but what you're really afraid of is what all that might point to.
you're having a nightmare about madness, Detective Britten, because somewhere inside, you fear that if you continue to deny the reality of your situation, this is where all that could end.
what are you doing?
you see a ring around the house?
like, a two-finger gold thing with the word "WILD" written across the top?
no. Why?
it's evidence; I got to find it.
I'll let you know if I see anything.
Rex! Get down here!
come here.
did you take the ring?
I asked you a question. Did you take the ring?
I, I...
I didn't think anyone would notice.
it's evidence in a murder trial, son.
you can go to jail. I could lose my job. I figured it wasn't important.
and that's a good enough reason to steal? I wanted to give it to my girlfriend.
your what?
she likes that kind of stuff, and I can totally get it back.
what girlfriend? You don't have a girlfriend. Yeah, I do.
since when? I don't know. A few months.
no. You would have told me.
you told me about the last one. The-the, the blonde one.
I didn't. Mom did.
right.
I know since she died, you want us to suddenly be, like, all cool, whatever.
but you're, you're still my dad. What does that mean?
I don't know. We just...
we just don't talk about stuff like that.
so you were gonna, what, send me a wedding invitation?
look, your mother's not here.
we don't have... your interpreter any more.
it's just you and me.
and if we want to make this work, we're gonna have to put some effort in.
I'm-I'm doing my best. You got to do it, too.
okay?
so, tell me something about her.
she got a name? Emma.
she worth stealing for, this Emma?
I'm sorry.
I'm supposed to see her tonight.
if you want to get the ring back, you could, you know...
meet her.
is it wrong that I still think it's romantic?
yeah... a little bit.
but he's gonna get you something he has to actually pay for, right?
Yes. You kids still wear those big clocks, right?
I like him! Why haven't I met him before?
Yeah, Rex, why not? I don't know.
all right, that's enough torture for one night.
you're not staying? No. I got what I came for.
it's nice to meet you, Emma. It's nice to meet you.
okay.
sorry, that's the way we do it in my family.
it's just, Rex and I are still at the, the high-five stage, but we're working on it.
just wait till you get home?
Dr. Lee, what are you doing in here?
they convinced Gabe to let me in. You got a pretty big dose of ketamine.
you'll probably feel the residual effects until it wears off.
you'll stabilize in a couple of hours. Easy.
how is he? What's he doing? Well, he's been...
what? What's going on?! What are they doing?!
Yeah, they're coming in.
they cut the power off.
means he can't control the doors or cameras.
who turned off the lights, Turn the lights on!
turn them on! Turn the lights on!
what does that mean?
it means SWAT's trying to find a way to come in here...
and shoot a man who's wired to explode.
why won't they just bring her to me?
Gabe, I need you to let me make a phone call or they're gonna come in here.
I won't let that happen.
I can still stop them. Please?
look, you want answers to your questions, don't you?
if they come in here and everybody dies, then you don't get any questions answered.
so, please, let me make a call.
Vega. Tell SWAT to stand down.
Gabe has a dead man's switch.
tell SWAT. - Stop! Stop!
let's break 'cause the guy's got a dead man's trigger.
we shoot him, the whole place goes up.
stand down. Stand down. Everyone hold your position.
for now.
okay, they're holding. What do we do?
I-I need you to look into a couple of things.
Gabe says his sister's being held by a Dr. Wilde.
is there anything on file? Dr. Wilde?
I don't know. I'll check.
and see what you can dig up on a trip he took with his sister just before she died.
trip? To where? To a beach or something.
okay. Thank you. All right, I'll see if I can find anything, and I'll get back to you. It's gonna take a little time.
you know, sometimes I see her.
here, in my room or...
she'll just be beside me walking down the hall.
I know she's not...
I-I know she's not really here, but it just feels so good to be around her again.
they keep saying that-that I... see things that aren't there.
but that's not my problem.
you know what my problem is?
no matter how hard I try, eventually,
I stop seeing things that aren't there.
that's why I had to do this.
I don't want to imagine seeing Christy any more.
I want it to be real.
all right?
yeah?
I've got no reference to Dr. Wilde anywhere.
not in the lab where he worked, not where he went to school, no one he's ever seen for treatment, nothing.
he's holding her.
he's got her in this... secret underground location.
I also don't have anything about a trip in '07.
all the records say that at that point, he was in pretty heavy therapy and afraid to travel.
all right. Keep looking.
they're getting somewhere. Just need a little bit more time.
okay?
doesn't make sense.
what?
Vega says there's no way this guy took a trip in '07.
maybe that's not what it refers to.
maybe. Did he find out anything more about Dr. Wilde?
no, Wilde's not the name of a doctor holding Christy underground, it's the name of the cemetery where she's buried.
there's got to be something here.
detective Britten, this is a huge step.
the fact that he's taken this detail and put it into his narrative, it demonstrates that, on some level, he remembers burying Christy in that cemetery.
on some level, he knows that she's dead.
if guided properly, we can help him to understand that there is no sister to bring to him.
we can end this standoff.
you want me to tell him his sister is dead?
isn't that exactly what you've been doing for years? It's different this time.
it's not you telling him, it's him telling you.
these glimpses of-of a healthy mind buried under layers of delusion and denial are rare.
it's up to us to properly seize them, to guide him.
I don't know. I don't think...
what are you talking about?
all right, look, Gabe...
I wasn't completely honest with you before.
I do have information about Christy.
do you know where she is?
since your wife's funeral.
there's no world in which your son survived the accident.
she escaped.
nobody was meant to know, because this place they were holding her underground was meant to be inescapable.
honestly, they thought it was impossible. But she did it.
Christy got out.
she beat them, Gabe.
and-and she managed to leave a message for you.
and Dr. Wilde, of course, was trying to keep the whole thing a secret.
what did she say?
she wanted you to know that she was okay, that she was free and happy, and she was never gonna let anyone catch her again.
and she promised that someday, someplace, you will see her again.
the last line just read...
I love you, Trip.
she's okay.
Yeah.
she's okay.
how did you know his sister called him Trip? I didn't.
I saw it on the picture, and his name was Gabriel Wyath III, so I figured I'd give it a shot.
I don't understand. Trip. As in triple.
nickname for third.
so you had the opportunity to help this patient see the truth, but you chose instead to perpetuate his denial. Why?
how would he be better off, thinking of his sister in the ground somewhere than-than thinking of her free, liberated, waiting for him?
explain to me what exactly is so great about seeing reality for what it is?
you've more or less summed up the reason why every major religion has some version of an afterlife.
the part you ????
you built a story about the costs of living with fantasies, and you allowed it to point you back to all the things that get lost in the shuffle between these worlds, like this relationship of your son's.
but when you came face-to-face with the larger revelations, you backed down.
you retreated into a-a scenario where you save the day, you play the hero, win the affection of the wife you've feared losing, and the approval of the therapist who's expressed doubts in you.
just like Gabe, you hold the keys that will tell you what's real and what's not.
but for the moment, you're unwilling to turn them.
what's that?
my God, I remember this.
you and Mom used to read this to me, like, every night.
for years.
Gabe didn't need to be forced into some kind of revelation for his story to turn out okay, so why are you so eager to do it to me?
detective Britten, you are comparing yourself to a schizophrenic whose delusions led him to be institutionalized.
I'd strongly prefer if we find a way to help you before you get that far.
well, didn't you feel frightened? Frightened?
Yeah, of course. Who wouldn't? Didn't you?
Absolutely.
but then, I wasn't inside like you.
after I advised you on-on how to approach Gabe, they put me in this secured van, in case I could be useful.
Dr. Lee?
but as it turned out, you did fine without me.
are you all right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I feel a little... strange.
it's probably the drugs wearing off.
I think you're finally making some real progress.
at this point, the best thing is probably for you to just...
,
I keep telling my wife she married me, not her mother, and she keeps telling me not to put her in that position.
dealing with a mother-in-law...
That's,like,#2 on my top ten list of reasons not to get married.
what's #1?
you know what #1 is.
every guy knows #1.
all units in the vicinity, campus security is reporting a possible illegal entry at the college pool.
dispatch, this is unit 7. We're on it.
Hey!
Hey! Stop!
let me see your hands!
unit seven.
we have the suspect. He's on the high dive.
sir, please come down from there now!
sir, come down.
don't make us come get you.
police officers!
show us your hands!
guys, it's okay.
I-I'm a cop.
my I. D.'s right here.
I-I-I got to reach for it. Hold on.
go ahead.
slowly.
I got him.
what the hell is going on, detective britten?
it's kind of hard to explain.
so tell me how this works.
I'm awake with my wife, and I close my eyes, I open them, I'm awake with my son.
and this has been happening since the accident?
so you begin working on one case here in reality, and then suddenly you begin working another case there in your dream.
it all feels completely real to me.
you can't tell whether you're awake or asleep at this very moment?
well, I can assure you, detective britten, this is not a dream.
that's exactly what the other shrink said.
tell him I have the Butler files and I'm on my way.
Yeah.
Yeah.
look, I'm trying to get on the road now.
let me call you back as soon as I get there.
listen, this is really nothing to worry about.
okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, tell him I said that.
okay.
Oh, come on.
you have to be kidding.
Marcus, you are one lucky man to be sitting here.
let me tell you something, my friend.
you walk out that door, I have a feeling your luck would change very quickly.
testify, and we'll see that you're taken care of.
Yeah, taken care of...
taken care of how?
you know the drill.
witness Protection, relocation.
a chance to walk away from this mess and start afresh.
look, I told you before, I'm just an accountant.
you're an accountant for Maxim Basayev.
now, we both know the only reason he's not gone down for human trafficking, drugs, guns...
you name it...
is because he kills anyone he thinks might compromise his operation.
don't insult us both by pretending it's a surprise.
we've been telling you for two months now that we would take down Basayev and his crew and that you could either help us or go down with them.
today, they threw you overboard.
and as far as life preservers go, we're it.
where would I go?
well, the U. S. attorney will work with you to find a suitable place.
you and your wife.
my wife.
Yeah.
look, look, she doesn't know anything.
about what I did for Basayev.
I understand, but I'm afraid that's not going to help.
he would use her to get to you.
she's still a target.
we have to get her into protective custody as soon as possible.
where is she?
she-she's out of town.
where?
Laguna. Some spa.
I...I don't know.
I'll have to look it up in my phone.
okay.
I'll get your phone, and I'll get a car pointed in that direction.
it's going to be okay.
you're doing the right thing.
when I came here...
when I first took this job, it was supposed to be for us.
we had nothing.
I wanted to be...
a man who could give her anything.
well, I'm sure she would rather have a live husband than another giant flat-screen TV.
Yeah. You don't know my wife.
Marcus was strictly the accountant, but he knows where the bodies are buried.
I mean, he laundered cash for him, covered money trails, and he kept records.
has he actually shown you these records?
no, but he's going to hand them over as soon as we settle on a relocation package.
we have been trying to nail Basayev for the last eight years.
this is a big win for us.
the wife's arrived.
she's on the way up.
what's going on?
are you okay?
Hi.
I'm fine. Yes, yes.
I don't understand.
they wouldn't tell me anything.
they just said you were in some kind of danger.
what's going on?
Alina, I,uh...
I, uh... - Mrs. Ananyev, I'm detective britten.
why don't we all go and sit down somewhere more quiet?
follow me.
so you've been working for the...
bratva?
Yes.
for how long?
two...
two years.
so you lied to me...
for two years.
every day.
every time you kissed me good-bye.
every time you came home late.
every time I ask you, how was your day?
it was all just lies.
no. Alina, listen.
how could you not tell me?
what if I had?
would it have made any difference?
it was blood money.
would knowing that have stopped you from spending it?
would you have given up all the clothes and the cars and the vacations, the gifts?
you wanted those things as much as me.
Alina, I wanted them because you...
and now we have nothing because of your lies!
you don't understand.
so...
we...we pack our home and we leave everything?
you can take whatever you can fit into, uh...
one large suitcase each.
where will they send us with one large suitcase each?
well, the prosecutors will work with you and Marcus, and, they'll find somewhere that you both feel...
what about my friends?
I can never speak to them again?
any link to your current life or your identity makes it easier for them to trace you.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
this is...
Alina, please, come back here and sit down.
they will find you, Mrs. Ananyev.
they tried to kill your husband today.
put a bomb in his car.
he's lucky to be alive.
he's in a unique position to bring down a major crime syndicate.
these people will not hesitate to do whatever it takes to you to stop him cooperating.
you understand?
they will find you.
I know this must be overwhelming.
I'm sorry, but if you value your life...
you really have no option.
please, come sit down.
so...
what happens now?
how long will we live here?
just until the details for your relocation package are worked out.
shouldn't be more than a few days.
now, we got a team of officers in the adjoining room.
we got some downstairs in the lobby.
if you need anything at all, you speak to them, or you can call us, but under no circumstances can you leave the room.
is that clear?
Yeah. - Okay.
my mother...she...
gave me a painting before she died.
there's, um, also a book of photos.
we'll send a team to your house to collect some items.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Bell...We have Bella right now.
who's up? Who's Bella?
our cat. She probably hasn't eaten all day.
we have to get her right now. - Calm down!
I won't go without Bella! - Alina, I want to help.
I'll kill you!
you've destroyed us!
all right. All right.
all right, let's calm down.
come on. Come on. Okay.
okay, I'm going to let you go.
you stay calm?
it's going to be okay.
it's going to be okay.
how can you say that?
you tell me I can never go back home.
everyone I know.
everything we have.
I have to leave it all behind.
how can you possibly tell me it's going to be okay?
real ESTATE FOR SALE
you can't even begin to imagine what that feels like.
Hey.
Hey.
when did you start doing all this?
uh, about three days ago.
well, I thought we were going to do it together.
Yeah, you said you wanted to do it last weekend, and the weekend before that, so...
I just decided to do it myself.
you giving away this dress?
I love you in this dress.
I haven't worn that dress in, like, 15 years.
and even when I did, I looked like a hooker.
china?
what's the matter with the China?
we're giving that away?
we don't touch it.
we haven't used it once in 18 years.
well, we're going to Oregon.
maybe in Oregon we'll...
be China kind of people. No?
look, deciding what to keep and what to give away...
it's hard.
we could come up with a reason to keep everything.
so, I just figured, if we don't use it, we should lose it.
Oh, come on.
you're giving this away?
and we have a tape player?
I mean, I don't even know if it works anymore.
where is it?
it's right there.
I can't believe it.
I made you this tape.
remember that summer?
you were working in Chatsworth.
here we go.
you hated that job...
but you loved this song.
you remember?
of course I remember.
you recorded that song, like, over and over again so I can listen to it on the way to work without having to hit rewind.
when's goodwill coming?
tomorrow morning.
all right, let me call and put 'em off for a couple of days.
what?
nothing. It...
look, this move to Oregon was my idea and I just know you have some reservations about it.
I just want to look through everything and make sure you're not giving away things that I'd like to keep.
don't read anything more into it than that.
Really?
Yeah.
you didn't tell him I was coming?
he'll be fine.
this guy Jake...
he's been your C. I.for how long?
for 15 years.
15 years?
how do you know he'll be okay working with me?
because he's not a complicated guy.
trust me, I know.
look...
you give him those. Cubans.
he'll be your new best friend.
Hey.
you read with those things on?
no, but I can't read with them off either.
doesn't matter.
who the hell is this?
Jake, this is my partner.
I'm detective Efrem Vega.
I've heard a lot about you.
the deal is I deal with you.
period.
I know, but, I'm not gonna be around much longer.
the arrangements always work for us pretty well, right?
so, I thought the two of you might be able to keep it going.
what does that mean...you're not gonna be around much longer?
are you leaving me?
I'm not leaving you.
I'm going with my wife.
going where?
Oregon.
Oregon?
who the hell lives in Oregon?
that's what I keep asking him.
the point is, if you want to keep drawing these get-out-of-jail-free cards, Vega's your guy, okay?
I hear that you are a fan of these.
Yeah, well, I-I quit.
quit?
come on. These are your favorite cigars.
I got eyes.
I can see what they are.
the doctor told me it's giving me reflux.
sorry.
Hey, what do you say we go someplace that's got real food, huh?
I feel like a New York steak served to me by a woman that's half my age.
sorry the captain's got us on a short leash, but here.
you can pay for your steak and mine.
generous tip.
be careful.
so...
you said something about a crew pulling a job?
Yeah.
San Pedro industrial park.
when?
tonight.
tonight?
they're hitting a warehouse that's leased to, uh, palace electronics.
and from what I understand, they got a six-man team with body armor.
so you better bring your whole posse.
that it?
what do you want? A map?
Thanks.
have a good time in Oregon.
see ya around.
see ya.
better get a team together.
6 out of 19, uh, we're clear all the way down the block on our side.
36, you got an overhead that's out right there.
I don't got a visual on you.
the last time Jake got anything wrong you were repeating sixth grade.
have a little patience.
I lost my patience an hour ago, which was two hours after Jake said this crew was supposed to show.
everyone, heads up.
we got an unmarked truck headed towards the target location.
what I tell you?
little patience.
7w43 copy.
all units, hold your positions.
stand by for my orders.
okay, copy that.
confirm visual.
just got visual.
single driver.
please respond.
that was exciting.
let's do a low-profile traffic stop in case he flagged us and kept going.
copy that.
he's playing you.
I've known him for 15 years, all right? - Exactly.
after 15 years, you hand him off with a c-note and a couple of cubans.
I know it doesn't agree with you, but a little warm and fuzzy doesn't hurt.
he's a C. I...confidential informant.
it's a business relationship.
he knows better than anyone, bad tips are bad for business.
Redrum.
I guess you know everything about everything.
so, I'm just going to sit back, hear it, and, you know, wait for more trucks not to appear.
7-11-43, trucks clear.
no involvement.
copy.
let's get a good F. I. just in case and then kick 'em.
Yes, sir. You got it.
yeah?
Hello?
how soon can you get over here?
Why? What's going on? What is that?
what you're listening to is Markus freaking out.
he woke up this morning and Alina had left.
what time?
well, the last confirmed time was, like, 2:00 A. M.
do we have any idea where she is?
none.
nobody knows anything.
let's hope Basayev doesn't either.
just get over here, okay?
if I would have gone, Alina would be safe.
she wouldn't be in danger.
the idea of her out there, alone...
Marcus. Marcus. - Unprotected...
you need to focus, okay?
you need to write down anyone who you could think of that she might be with right now.
relatives maybe.
no, neither of us have family here.
okay, what about friends?
friends...
Oh, come on, man! She must have friends!
I was always working, okay?
I don't really know her friends.
I remember a few people she talked about. - Okay.
I don't know. Only their first names.
all right, what about places she used to go?
when you were at work, where did she like to go?
Where'd she hang out? - I don't know.
spas, beauty salons, book clubs.
I don't know. I don't know.
do you even know your wife at all, Marcus?
I guess about as well as she knew me.
that doesn't mean I don't love her.
everything I did was to give Alina the kind of life I thought she wanted.
without her, nothing matters. Nothing.
so unless you find her, you can forget about me testifying.
Marcus... - Whatever I have to do to keep Alina safe,
I will do it, okay?
even if that means giving myself up to Basayev.
all right.
call records.
she checked her messages before she left, but it the phone's been off since then.
we can't track her unless she turns it back on.
credit cards?
the last transaction was the atm in the motel lobby.
she was obviously smart enough to know we'd be looking.
all right.
we've got an "attempt to locate" out, notify the bus terminals, airports, but let's face it: It's probably tipped off Basayev that she's in play.
what?
the last transaction before she took the cash, it's at her hotel in Palm Springs, the palace.
Oh, yeah. We called. She's not there.
did we send somebody out?
I just said she's not there.
she's not at any of the other places on Marcus' list either.
at least we know she was there for three days before she bolted.
maybe she said something to someone that'll give us somewhere to dig.
so you want to go talk to a hotel staff instead of her friends?
Yeah.
you coming?
morning.
how can I help you gentlemen?
I'm detective britten.
this is detective Freeman.
we're looking for a missing person who was a guest here over the weekend.
Yes, the clerk told me. Mrs. Ananyev.
how can I help?
we'd like any information that might help us track her down.
so, uh, she spoke to anyone in the hotel?
she used any of the services?
maybe made a call from her phone?
let me pull up her folio.
I'm afraid there were no calls, and no indication she used any guest amenities except for room service.
thank you.
that is a steep room service charge, if you don't mind me saying.
that's one expensive breakfast for a woman someone who can't weigh more than 110.
was Mrs. Ananyev staying here with someone?
I'm afraid I don't know.
she registered for a single king-size bed.
is your bartender on yet?
russian accent, a lot of jewelry?
she ran up a hefty bill for someone drinking alone.
Yeah. Yeah, I remember. She wasn't alone.
all right. Who was she with?
I assumed it was her husband.
you get a name?
no. But he was here before her, bought himself a drink.
I can probably pull the credit card slip. - What did he look like, this guy?
blond, about your height.
it looks like he spent a lot of time at the gym.
hold on. I'm coming.
yes?
Greg hollander?
he's not answering his cell.
maybe we're too late.
maybe they're already on their way to Cabo.
let's put out an attempt to locate.
see anything?
no.
I'll go get a warrant.
go back inside, take a look.
that's gonna take all day.
what else we gonna do?
set? - Yep.
major crimes confirmed they're muscle for Basayev, fresh off the boat.
it's probably why we didn't recognize 'em.
I'm gonna go talk to him, see if I can't get anything.
what about lover boy?
they tell me he's got no connection with the accountant, with Basayev.
maybe he just hooked up with the wrong woman.
I'll catch up with you later. - Okay.
look straight ahead.
all right, give me a minute here. You can finish later.
all right, Greg, what'd you tell them?
nothing.
come on, Greg. Your face looks like a tray of lasagna.
it's okay. You got nothing to be ashamed of.
you can't expect me to believe you didn't tell them where she was?
I don't know where she is.
and even if I did, I wouldn't put Alina in harm's way.
she's my friend. I love her.
Oh, and someone else figured that out.
any idea who could have pointed them in this direction?
could've been anyone.
maybe she told a friend about me.
maybe one of my clients saw us together.
what's your line of work?
I...Provide companionship.
upon request.
to men.
so, your relationship with Ms. Ananyev...Wouldn't be...?
I mean, you wouldn't have, uh...?
even if I was straight, that's not what Alina was after.
what was she after?
just someone to be with.
someone to talk to, have fun with.
and did she give you money for your time?
I never asked for it.
she forced it on me.
forced. Like she was allergic to it.
but she kept insisting, so...
I'm letting her pay for my schutzhund certification.
your...
sorry. Your what?
I want to train dogs for a living.
and, uh, how did you two meet?
we go to the same gym.
we just...I don't know...we clicked.
we'd go out for drinks at silly clubs.
we'd go dancing. She's always dancing.
you ever hear her laugh? - No.
I doubt anyone but me has in a long time.
you mean her husband?
especially her husband.
so, she mentioned him?
that's really all she ever talked about.
how happy they used to be when they first got married, and how sad it made her that they'd grown so far apart.
Hey.
britten's on the phone for you.
did you find her?
I told you you can forget my help until I know Alina's safe.
I told you that!
calm down. We're on the same team.
I just need some help here.
I need some background.
where did you guys meet?
new York. Why?
what about places you used to go on the east coast?
before you got the job.
a place that felt special.
I don't know. I don't know. It was so long ago.
we didn't really have money to go anywhere at all.
why are you asking me this?
put it this way: That young couple that you were, if you ran away together, where would you be?
Yeah, there is one place, but, uh...
I don't know if it's even still there.
you're going to take me back?
basayev's been looking for you as hard as we have.
that leaves you with two options.
either you enter witness protection with your husband, or I can try and arrange for you to enter separately.
what should I do?
I guess that depends.
on what?
on how you feel about your husband.
Marcus told me where to find you.
he knew you'd be here.
he remembered this place.
he said, uh, you used to vacation here?
Yes. - After your marriage.
it was only six Miles away from our house.
it wasn't much nicer then.
but it had this view.
and...and somehow it was enough.
we were happy here.
and then he took the job, and we had money, and we traveled to places much more beautiful than this.
places we had dreamed about.
it was never the same.
I didn't know what he did, but I know it changed him.
it changed me.
I just don't think a person can go back again.
maybe not, but maybe you have a chance to start over.
and that's one more chance than most people get.
I know one suitcase isn't much to take into a new life, but honestly,
I don't know if you need to take anything if you love each other.
keep those separate for now.
you want to take the stuff on the left?
got it?
Hey. - Hey.
I thought you cancelled the Goodwill.
I did. Then I, uh, un-cancelled it.
want a coffee?
sure.
so, when did you have a chance to go through all those boxes?
I didn't.
I just figured whatever you want to give away is fine by me.
Really? - Yeah.
so, wh-what happened? What changed your mind?
I slept on it.
and I realized you don't need a 20-year-old cassette if you've still got the song.
all right, you busy tonight?
no.
wrong.
I'm taking you out.
Really?
where?
it's a surprise.
the new Italian restaurant we've been wanting to try?
not a new place.
okay, you've got to give me a clue.
I just did.
I'll see you.
I sent flowers when your kid died.
I don't do flowers for anybody.
especially not a cop.
it's not something you hand off like an old coat that doesn't fit anymore.
I know, Jake.
no, you don't know nothing.
you try to buy me off with a couple of Cuban cigars?
smoking them with somebody I considered to be a friend...
that's all I cared about.
you're right.
you're absolutely right.
that's why I'm here to apologize.
you were a friend.
you are a friend still.
and I'm gonna miss our dinners together.
all of it.
and if you don't want to work with Vega, that's your call.
I think he's a good kid.
to be honest with you, he's the one that pointed out how badly I messed up with you.
if you're interested, we'll do it right.
we'll go out for a nice steak dinner, and I'll make a proper introduction.
but if not, then so be it.
tell you what.
me and the kid, we'll have dinner alone, okay?
I'm not invited?
no, just me and him.
I mean, if it's gonna be us, let's see if it can be us, you know?
you know what I mean?
sure.
by the way, the, uh, that tip that I gave you about the crew, it's a good tip.
I gave you the wrong details, though.
I'll give the kid the right ones.
okay.
Thanks, my friend.
you take care of yourself. - You, too.
Oregon?
who lives in Oregon?
Oh, my God.
it looks exactly the same. - Yeah.
why'd you bring me here?
I guess I thought we could go back to the beginning, you know?
where it all started.
when it was just us.
I can't believe that was us.
it's like we were like different people.
we were so young.
well, you were young. I was...
you were cute.
very cute.
I was persistent.
I had to wrestle you away from that water-polo-playing jackass. Lars.
his name was Mars. For the record.
what kind of parents call their kid Mars?
well, they happened to be very nice people.
you know, I wouldn't give yourself too much credit for being persistent.
I was the one who came up to you.
actually, you went around asking everyone where your towel was, and I came up to you and gave you my towel.
you know that's not how... - Yeah.
well, I'm glad you did.
me, too.
I do remember we started talking, and we just talked and talked.
sat right over there.
by the time we looked up, they'd closed the pool.
you remember what happened after that?
what we did next?
no.
Yes.
I forgot about that.
Hey.
what do you think?
no.
no, it's crazy talk. I'm not...
Yeah, what, you're scared?
are you sure about this?
Nope.
one...
two...
Oh, that's new.
come on.
stand by that thing; I'll go and get the clothes.
no, let's just run for the car.
my keys are in my pocket.
what? - I love you.
OK everyone, this is the game of the year, and we want things to go as trouble free as is possible.
I want check-points at all the major intersections around the stadium.
and extra patrols at potential hot-spots.
if you see anything, step in, making nothing before it has a chance to become something.
history is an indicator, these bowl games, they get pretty unruly.
there's small space, huge crowd, an ocean of alcohol, and some die-hard out-of-town fans who have come a long way to root for their team.
L'Jacks. Yeah, okay.
L'Jacks stink, dude!
who threw the ball?
come on, you big bulldogs, throw it in my face! Rob, can we just go inside, man?
What'd I say about being a puss?! You got to stand up to these people.
who threw it?! Seattle sucks!
who wants to diss Seattle to my face?! Whatever.
your job is to make sure the only thing newsworthy about this game is the score.
you heard me... A hundred on Seattle. Man You sure you can cover it, John?
something happens to your other arm, you won't be able to run your business.
don't worry. I've been following this one. This one's good.
I've got you down for Seattle, minus one. Hundred thousand.
whatever happens, John, I better not have to come looking for you.
just make the bet.
you're kidding me. You're actually going?
of course. It's a huge game.
Yup. But, uh...
wait, you find it so unbelievable that I'm a sports fan?
certainly I'll be watching.
the pageantry, the struggle, the victory and defeat.
a sport is a link to our tribal past.
I'm surprised you're not more interested. For me, every game could go either way.
so, it's kind of hard to...
keep track or care any more.
and here we are in the forth quarter, ten seconds left on the clock.
the kicker's lining up, the ball is in motion.
the kick is no good! Los Angeles has won!
Los Angeles has won the game come on, Britten!
come on! With just ten seconds left.
...an easy kick. L. A. wins over Seattle.
what an excit...
and here we are in the fourth quarter, ten seconds left on the clock.
the kicker is lining up, and the kick sails right through the uprights.
Seattle has pulled out the victory over Los Angeles.
Yes!
...stunned Los Angeles team...
in one world, the field goal misses by inches, in the other, it's good.
bulldogs suck! Yeah, you. - That's right.
it all just feels so arbitrary.
I'll remember you.
is everything okay?
Yes, fine.
frankly, now that I can see how easily it can go either way,
I wonder why we get so wrapped up in it to start with.
I mean, when you really think about it, does it ever really matter who wins or loses?
so tell me how this works.
I'm awake with my wife, and I close my eyes, I open them, I'm awake with my son.
and this has been happening since the accident?
so you begin working on one case here in reality, and then suddenly you begin working another case there in your dream.
it all feels completely real to me.
you can't tell whether you're awake or asleep at this very moment?
well, I can assure you, Detective Britten, this is not a dream.
that's exactly what the other shrink said.
when was the last time when you saw your brother? What?
your brother...
just bef... just before I went to go get the car.
we parked far away and, you know, and, with the cast Rob was so slow, and so...
you know, I left him at the entrance. When I came back, he wasn't there, you know.
I looked for like a half hour or so and...
then I called security and, uh, and, uh...
Yeah, I-I...
I guess I shouldn't be that surprised. What does that mean?
rob, you know, he's...
he's always getting into fights, especially after a few beers.
I mean, he didn't listen to anyone. And who did he get into it with today?
I don't... everybody.
I mean, you know, he spent just as much time screaming at the people in the stands as he did the players on the field.
still, I never imagined, uh... Where were you guys sitting?
can I keep that? - Yeah.
all right, we're going to pull together some of people who were sitting around you, might have gotten into it with Rob.
you think you'd be able to identify them? I don't know.
like I said, you know, it wasn't like one particular guy.
rob was sort of a walking brawl. We have to start somewhere.
so we'll arrange accommodations for you for the next couple of nights.
then when we have something for you to look at, we'll call you in, is that all right?
all right, officer Harbin will take care you. Officer?
thank you very much.
you really have to piss somebody off to get them to cave in half your skull.
sounds like he specialized in pissing people off. Wonder what broke his leg.
look at this.
look at the green on his ear. Somebody left some decoration.
home team colors. - Great.
Rex, come on. I got dinner downstairs.
Rex, come on. Let's go. I'm not hungry.
I know you don't want to hear this right now but you have to trust me.
there will be other girls.
who said this was about a girl?
nobody lies in bed all day listening to depressing music because they have a stomach cramp.
I'm a Detective. I know when people are lying.
then why'd you let me stay home? I've wanted the occasional day in bed myself.
but you get one free pass and this is it.
tomorrow morning, you're back at school on time.
you understand?
all right, move over.
all right, you want to talk about it?
what?
what, I don't know, whatever happened with Emma.
I think I just need some more time to myself.
okay.
I got to go to work for a few hours anyway. So there's food on the counter if you need it.
hang in there, kiddo. It's going to be okay.
I'll see you later.
it's Emma. Leave me a message.
come on.
just call me back, text me, something.
this place went up really quickly.
the dry cleaning chemicals are very flammable.
victim appears to have died of smoke inhalation.
got her name... Sabina Fernandez.
her neighbor said, uh, she worked here.
so we don't think she could have started this fire? No, it was definitely arson.
someone played with the fuse box, tried to make it look like a short.
we recovered a piece of plastic tubing that contained some sort of accelerant.
we'll run a chemical analysis, let you know if we find anything that might tell us where it came from.
all right. Thanks.
so what's our next move? Well, you tell me.
well, uh, we check the streets for security cameras, ATMs, any video from the time of the fire.
Yeah, and then?
well, then we interview the victim's family and friends, see if anyone wanted to hurt her.
like boyfriends, husbands... Come on, she's living alone in the back of a cleaners.
if you wanted to kill someone like this, you go to the trouble of setting a fake electrical fire?
she's not the target. She's just unlucky.
so, an insurance job?
sometimes, if it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's the guy with the big knife.
the owner. - Yeah.
what do we have here?
there's a possible reason why. What do you see here?
a lot of red numbers.
they're bets. Look, it's a ledger.
and you don't write things down in red when you're winning.
how much do you think he owes? I don't know.
hello. Look that this.
last bet, Seattle over L. A. 100 grand.
well, if he would have bet on L. A. she'd still be alive and we'd both still be home right now.
I don't know.
I have a feeling which ever way the game went, we'd still be working a case somewhere.
so, uh, you haven't said anything, and I haven't brought it up.
the calendar says that your last day is coming up soon.
that's when the movers are coming. I'll be around; I'll close this case out.
and then what? You're just gonna pack up your desk and go?
and leave without saying good-bye? I'm not huge on good-byes.
so what if me and some of the guys put something together?
what do mean, "put something together"?
well, after all the time you spent on the job, the least we can do is take over a bar, give you a proper send-off.
maybe.
is that like a "yes" maybe or...?
sure, fine.
good evening.
detective Britten and Detective Vega. LAPD. We're looking for John Koh.
Sabina was part of our family.
she worked for us for the last seven years.
she opened the store every morning.
she was always the last one to leave.
but she never gave you any indication that she was staying at the property?
no, she... She was a private person.
Mrs. Koh, could we have a few minutes alone with your husband, please?
we'll be taking a statement from you, too.
thank you.
how do you think this could've happened?
I... caught some neighborhood kids vandalizing the store once.
had to call the police on them. You think they would have done this on purpose?
no, I suppose not.
are you insured?
Yes, of course. For how much?
a million.
you recognize that ledger, Mr. Koh?
how much did you owe?
how much does he owe, Detective?
487000
that's also a lot of money.
detectives, I'm telling you...
??? telling you Miss Fernandez's death makes this a felony murder case.
and we know the fire was no accident. Now, here's what I think happened.
I think you got yourself in trouble, you dug yourself a deeper and deeper hole and you panicked.
you had no idea miss Fernandez was living there, and you went for the insurance money.
no, I swear to you, I had... nothing to do with this.
look.
I'll take a lie detector test. All right?
if that, if that's what you need.
we can arrange that. - All right, good.
I'll do whatever it takes to prove to you that I didn't do this.
let's assume for a second that you're telling the truth.
somebody wanted that insurance money.
so who do you owe?
I can't.
you're scared?
can you imagine how scared Sabina was trapped inside a burning building she couldn't escape from?
this person you described as a family member. Now, let me ask you again.
who do you owe?
solomon Kang? - Yeah. What is this?
we have a warrant to search your premise in connection with the fire at Koh's Imperial Cleaners.
don't know nothing about that.
do you have any weapons on you? - No.
mind if we pat you down?
you got the wrong guy.
Yeah. The guy who did this left traces of an accelerant.
turned out to be nitromethane, which is a fuel used for tuner cars.
well, you knew that 'cause you manufacture it right here.
come on, man, I sell that stuff to anyone who comes in here.
you arrest me, you might as well arrest everyone with a souped-up ricer in L. A. County.
I don't think that they all take bets from John Koh and I'm sure that they did not break his arm.
look, I'm telling you, I didn't torch his place. It's not my style.
look, we're talking about reasonable doubt.
unless you put him on the scene, we don't have enough to make the case stick.
for all you know, he didn't actually do it himself. He may have sent one of his guys.
well, what do we do with him now? Well, then we'll file for the illegal gambling.
while we hold him we'll see what we can find.
don't get more, it'll get plead down to a misdemeanor.
Yeah, but the fuel from his shop started the fire.
now the lab says the chemical signatures are identical.
it's practically a fingerprint. But Kang told us a lot of people had access to the fuel.
figure out how it got from point a to point B. Until then...
you caught a bookie not a murderer.
Thanks, Marco. - Yeah.
let's pull the tapes from the store up the street from the cleaners.
but there's no angle on the cleaners.
it's just traffic going by. - Yeah.
that's what I want to see. Why?
Kang's got a tuner car place, right? Blends his own fuel.
what do you think his boys drive, Buicks?
there. That one.
that's about the right time frame. Yeah.
all right.
can we get a plate on it?
no.
he just zips right by in profile.
this is it. - All right.
let's print it out.
custom paint job like that is almost as good as a plate.
let's get patrol to start looking for it.
put together a list of everyone in Koreatown that does custom paint jobs on tuner cars.
where you going? Home to bed. It's 1: 00 A. M.
don't you think I'd like some sleep, too?
fair enough.
dad. Dad.
what's going on? Emma's lying to me.
there's no way she broke up with me because she caught me staring at Cassie Andersen.
right.
how do I give her one of those polygraph things?
giving your ex-girlfriend a polygraph is not one of your better ideas.
there's something she's not telling me.
you said you could tell...
when someone's lying. How do you do it?
son... Seriously, how do you know?
well... Liars tend to, uh, stiffen up.
you know, their body language, their arms and feet become, their movements become minimal. They cross their arms or they...
touch their nose or their throat. They'll avoid eye contact.
they generally get defensive.
you know, if you're telling the truth you're on the offensive.
okay. Yeah, thanks, this is good...
h-hold on. W-wait a second.
before you go off conducting an interrogation into a breakup, can I ask you... What do you hope to find?
I just want her to tell me the truth.
Yeah. No, hold on. Rex! Hold on!
I'll see you tonight. Man, what's going on?
you don't want to know. All right, what's up?
I think we might've got lucky.
yeah? - Yeah, a motorcycle cop spotted a car in a ditch this morning about 7: 00 A. M. and the driver was passed out in the airbag.
I don't know how long he was here, but it did not sober him up.
he still blew a . 28 on the breathalyzer.
so you got a drunk guy in a ditch. Why is he our guy?
well, his license matches the name on the season ticket holder manifest for G20.
was he even at the game? Well, the odds are pretty good on that one.
keep the wheel of car as you ???????
be right back with the cones, and, uh, we'll do some parallel parking.
okay.
first you skip homeroom, then you don't answer my calls.
why won't you talk to me? You know why.
there's no way you broke up with me because...
you saw me talking to Cassie Andersen.
you stare at her all the time. - Everyone looks at her.
she's gorgeous and she dresses like she's in a rap video.
Rex... - Please.
tell me to my face that you dumped me because you saw me looking at Cassie Andersen.
is that really why?
Yes. You're lying.
no, I'm not. - You did it again.
did what? Lied to me.
how do you know?!
does it matter how I know? What matters is that I'm right, and we both know it.
Emma! Emma, what are you doing? You won't even talk to me.
Emma, please! I don't want to talk about it!
and trust me, you don't want to know. Trust me, I do.
please just tell me the truth and I swear I'll leave you alone.
I don't know.
well, he was painted green.
and since your brother had traces of green paint on his body, we were curious if maybe...
he got into a fight with somebody who was painted green.
Yeah, there was this L. A. fan who did the whole green thing.
you know, my brother got in this guy's face, they start shoving each other...
they threw a few punches, but security broke it up really fast.
does that look like the guy?
I mean, I didn't really get a good look at him.
I mean, he was green.
okay. Thanks.
what do you do for a job, George? I'm an investment banker.
no wonder our country's going in the toilet.
our people of high finance are painting themselves green.
who did you go to the game with?
with some buddies from college.
it's why I had the green paint on.
it's kind of a tradition, an alumni thing.
look, guys, what's going on?
it's a little overkill for a dui, right?
is it?
recognize this guy?
no. Take a good look.
his name is Robert Jones. Never seen him.
funny.
when I get in a fight, the guy I'm fighting with usually makes an impression.
don't tell me he's pressing charges.
so, you do remember him. We got into it in the stands.
it was no big deal. No big deal.
no.
what?
he didn't humiliate you?
in front of your friends? In front of your banker buddies?
your college buddies? - No.
what happened? You put him down? Did he put you down? Punch each other?
you scratch each other? Pull each other's hair? What was it, George?
did you follow him outside, George? No.
see, the good news is, he won't be pressing charges.
the bad news is, he was found beaten to death in the parking lot.
what?
those are some ugly bruises on your knuckles there, George.
and the blood on your shirt... Where's that from?
wait. You... You guys think I had something to do with this?
we're just trying to work out how it went from a fistfight in the stands to a dead guy in the parking lot, and you passed out a couple of miles away in a ditch with a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit.
it looks to us a lot like you were trying to leave the stadium in a real hurry.
no. No. I,
no? Okay, tell us what happened, George.
I can't. You... can't?
why is that?
I don't remember.
you don't remember?
that's what you're going with? I mean, seriously.
the amnesia's not the great legal smoke screen you might think it is, George.
you have to come up with an actual story.
look, I was hammered.
blacked out drunk.
but I wouldn't kill someone just 'cause L. A. lost.
la WINS PACIFIC COAST BOWL BULLDOGS DEAL DEATH BLOW TO SEATTLE
you packing or reading? Movers are coming tomorrow.
just reading up about yesterday's game so I don't embarrass myself in front of the guys at work.
I tell you Vega's organizing a going-away party for me?
I'm amazed you agreed to go. - Why?
cause I just know how you hate being the center of attention.
he's like a little puppy dog. I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
your ears must have been burning.
I don't know about my ears, but my eyes are pretty tired. I got two hours of sleep.
but I had patrol hit up every paint and body shop in Koreatown, and finally found the one that painted the tuner car that we were looking for.
well, it's registered to a Korean kid named Jinsung do.
got some priors... One for gun possession.
got dropped to a misdemeanor because he's a minor.
any connection with Kang? - Yeah.
he's one of Kang's runners. Can we go talk to him?
all right, I'm about to leave the station.
want me to pick you up? - Where does he live?
Koreatown... With his grandmother.
Hello?
LAPD. Is Jinsung Do home?
ma'am, I understand you want to protect your grandson, but we have a warrant for his arrest, so if you want him to be safe, I need you to open this door now.
clear.
clear.
he's running. Take the back.
stop!
stop!
stop!
this kid has the shoot girls. Yeah, 8: 00.
if we had the whole place, it's going down.
all right.
that was Danny.
Danny evidence, Danny Motor Pool?
evidence. Says his sister works at this restaurant in Hollywood, has this amazing roof deck.
says she's gonna give us a deal to rent it out tomorrow night for the party.
mechanical bull. Does it sound like fun? Sure.
Dr. Brand to cardiology.
you keep staring at that thing like it's gonna tell you something.
detectives?
he's got a few broken ribs and a subdural hematoma, but he's stable.
can we interview him? - Yeah.
just keep it short.
Thanks.
Jinsung, remember us?
we have enough evidence linking you to the fire that killed Sabina Fernandez, with a secure conviction for murder.
now, you're a juvie, but you'll get tried as an adult, so, that's gonna get you 25 to life, or a death sentence.
so this is a serious conversation.
it may be your last chance to do something good for yourself for a long, long time.
now, I don't think you acted alone, and I'd like to be able to tell the D. A. that you cooperated.
and maybe he'll go easy on you.
but you have to tell me who hired you.
and don't worry about Kang trying to hurt you or your grandmother.
he's not gonna be able to touch you from prison.
this is your last chance to help yourself.
Kang's not the one who hired me.
no? No.
okay, then, who hired you?
it's the police.
detectives, please come in. Thank you.
can I get you some tea? No, we're good. Thank you.
we have a suspect in custody who confessed to setting the fire.
I think you know him. His name is Jinsung Do.
Kang sends him around every week to settle my account, to pay out or collect.
mostly to collect. So, you were right about Kang.
he sent Jinsung to burn down my store.
not according to Mr. Do. But he works for Kang.
but he says he was working for someone else that night.
you want to tell your husband, or shall I?
tell him what?
that you hired Mr. Do to burn down the store.
me? That's crazy.
that you promised him $25, 000 of the insurance money.
he's making this up so Kang doesn't hurt his family.
he's lying!
is he lying about the three calls you made to his cell phone last week?
because that's what the records show.
I understand you were trying to dig your husband out of trouble, save the business.
I suspect you did not know Ms. Fernandez was sleeping on the property, but I promise you that lying to us now will only make things worse for you.
I begged you to stop, but you wouldn't listen.
even when they hurt you, you wouldn't listen.
what other choice did I have? Sabina died in that fire.
and I'm the one who has to live with that. If you even call that living.
I keep seeing her face... - Su Mi...
again and again! - Ma'am, ma'am.
stop it!
Mrs. Koh, please don't resist! Stop it!
we're placing you under arrest for the murder of Sabina Fernandez.
you have the right to remain silent...
the victim's mom and surviving son are waiting to claim the body, wondering what the holdup is.
frankly, so am I. I had to pull this from sid.
Why?
cause I think we have the wrong guy.
I'm listening.
we found this next to his body, so we assumed it was his, right?
and it's also his team.
look at him. Big, beefy guy.
so what?
so, I knew something was bothering me, and I realized this morning what it was.
put it on him.
that's no way that's his. - Okay.
so, if it's not the victim's hat, whose is it?
then will you please call Aunt Sue? Please call her.
it's not gonna do any good... I'll be right back.
look, guys, I don't know what's going on, but, my mother... she's been through a lot, okay, and,
and I should take her home.
I'm afraid she'll have a lot more to go through before the day is over.
you can tell your mother whatever you want, but we have to talk to you now.
why am I here? Why do you think you're here, Kenneth?
I don't know.
let me tell you what Detective Bird here thinks happened.
we know your brother, Rob, was violent, that he got in everyone's face.
Yeah, I know, I know; I'm the one who told you that.
Yeah, but you didn't tell us that he was abusive to you.
we have witnesses at the stadium said he was pushing you around.
that must have been humiliating.
must have made you feel small and weak in front of a crowd like that.
sure, he-he was hard on me, but, you know, that-that's what big brothers do.
you said you went to the car afterwards, you couldn't find it?
I couldn't. That's not what we think went down.
here.
do me a favor, and, uh, put that on.
put it on, or I'll put it on for you.
it fits, right?
it fits like a glove.
see, we found it next to your brother's dead body.
after you killed him, you grabbed the wrong cap.
no.
I have the same hat. Different sizes.
you took his, you left yours. Kenneth?
we already pulled hair samples.
we know you killed your brother, and you were going to let an innocent man take the fall.
here's the only question left: What do we tell your mother?
she's outside, waiting to take Rob's body home.
when this all comes out, and it will all come out...
...we can tell her one of two things. That she raised a cold-blooded killer.
or that her son made a mistake.
that he's human. That he was provoked.
that he was bullied, and that for once in his life, he stood up for himself.
I didn't mean to kill him.
okay? I swear I didn't.
during the whole game, he kept slapping me in the back of the head and calling me a girl because I wouldn't stand up for him during those fights with the other fans.
and then after... After the game was done, it got really bad, you know?
we were... we were walking back to the car, and-and-and I told him to stop, and he wouldn't.
then he pushed me on the ground, he got in my face, and he called me a pussy, and I-I...
I felt this-this loose brick underneath me, and I just... I grabbed it.
and I...
okay.
dad.
what are you... What are you doing here?
is everything okay? Can I talk to you?
Yeah, sure. You want to sit down? I'll get you a soda or something?
is there, like, someplace more private?
okay, what's going on?
dad, I got her pregnant.
how far along is she?
she lost it.
she never told me. This whole time, I've been acting like an idiot, and she's been dealing with this and the whole thing.
I-I mean...
it-it's all my fault.
well, you're both responsible.
no, she was always smart about...
protection and...
I know when it happened.
in the very beginning, and I didn't have anything, and I...
I told her it would be okay, and she wasn't...
she wasn't sure, and-and I promised her it would be fine.
and it wasn't.
all right, how is she?
I don't... I don't know.
I mean, she says she's fine, but she hasn't told anyone.
she's just been dealing with it alone.
she said she didn't think I could handle it.
and she was right. What's wrong with me?
there's nothing wrong with you. You're a teenager.
you just reacted like one, that's all. Don't be too hard on yourself.
how do I fix it?
well, you have to let her know that when she needs anything, if she needs anything, that you will be there for her.
I can do that.
let me grab my bag, and I'll get you home.
did you watch the game? They almost won.
there was this one play, this one field goal, and it missed by a few inches.
just that one little thing.
one tiny, little thing, and this could all be different.
I just texted her, and she said she wants to come over.
listen, uh, you know how you said that you knew when it happened?
back in the beginning? When was that?
just before mom died. Emma said she found out just after the funeral.
Why?
where are you going? I didn't want to wake you.
I got to go out for a while.
the movers are coming up to start packing today.
I know.
I'll be back.
I'm, Michael...
Yeah, Mr. Britten, hi.
I-I was at the funeral.
could we, uh...
I'll catch up with you guys after.
Bye. See you later.
what are you doing here?
I want to ask you a question, and it might be completely...
inappropriate.
are you...
...By any chance...
h-how did you know?
it's Rex's.
Mr... I-I thought about calling you, I just...
it's okay.
it's okay.
it's gonna be okay.
can you tell them how to get the ladder up into the attic?
guys, can you give us five, please?
just give us a minute? Thank you.
what's going on?
there's something we need to talk about.
okay, everyone, this is the game of the year and we want things to go as trouble-free as possible.
I want checkpoints at all the major intersections around the stadium and extra patrols of potential hot spots.
if you see anything, step in, make it nothing before it has a chance to become something.
history is an indicato these Bowl games, they get pretty unruly.
there's small space, huge crowd, an ocean of alcohol, and some die-hard out-of-town fans who have come a long way to root for their team.
L'Jacks.
Yeah, okay.
L'Jacks stink, dude!
Hey, who threw the ball?
come on, you big Bulldogs, throw it in my face!
rob, can we just go inside, man?
Hey, what'd I say about being a puss?!
you got to stand up to these people.
who threw it?!
Seattle sucks!
who wants to diss Seattle to my face?!
whatever.
your job is to make sure the only thing newsworthy about this game is the score.
same DAY SERVICE OPEN 7 DAYS
alteration
you heard me - a ndred on Seattle.
you sure you can cover it, John?
something happens to your other arm, you won't be able to run your business.
don't worry.
I've been following this one.
this one's good.
I've got you down for Seattle, minus one.
hundred thousand.
whatever happens, John, I better not have to come looking for you.
just make the bet.
you're kidding me.
you're actually going?
of course.
it's a huge game.
Yup.
but, uh...
Oh, wait, you find it so unbelievable that I'm a sports fan?
Oh, certainly I'll be watching.
the pageantry, the struggle, the victory and defeat.
a sport is a link to our tribal past.
I'm surprised you're not morenterested.
for me, every game could go either way.
so, it's kind of hard to keep track or care anymore.
and here we are in the forth quarter, ten seconds left on the clock.
the kicker's lining up, the ball is in motion.
the kick is no good!
Los Angeles has won!
Los Angeles has won the game
come on, Britten!
come on! ...
an easy kick.
l. A. wins over Seattle. What an excit...
and here we are in the fourth quarter, ten seconds left on the clock.
the kicker is lining up, and the kick sails right through the uprights.
Seattle has pulled out the victory over Los Angeles.
Yes!
stunned Los Angeles team...
in one world, the field goal misses by inches, in the other, it's good.
it all just feels so arbitrary.
Oh, I'll remember you.
is everything okay?
Yes, fine.
frankly, now that I can see how easily it can go either way,
I wonder why we get so wrapped up in it to start with.
I mean, when you really think about it, does it ever really matter who wins or loses?
so tell me how this works.
I'm awake with my wife, and I close my eyes, I open them, I'm awake with my son.
and this has been happening since the accident?
so you begin working on one case here in reality, and then suddenly you begin working another case there in your dream.
it all feels completely real to me.
you can't tell whether you're awake or asleep at this very moment?
well, I can assure you Detective Britten, this is not a dream.
that's exactly what the other shrink said.
when was the last time you saw your brother?
what?
your brother.
just bef...
just before I went to go get the car.
um, we parked far away and, you know, and, um, with the cast Rob was so slow, and so...
you know, I left him at the entrance.
when I came back, he wasn't there, you know.
I looked for like a half hour or so and...
then I called security and, uh, and, uh...
Yeah, I- I...
I guess I shouldn't be that surprised.
what does that mean?
rob, you know, he's...
he's always getting into fights, especially after a few beers.
I mean, he didn't listen to anyone.
and who did he get into it with today?
I don't...
everybody.
I mean, you know, he spent just as much time screaming at the people in the stands as he did the players on the field.
still, I never imagined, uh...
where were you guys sitting?
can I keep that? - Yeah.
all right, we're going to pull together some of people who were sitting around you, might have gotten into it with Rob.
you think you'd beble to identify them?
I don't know.
like I said, you know, it wasn't like one particular guy.
rob was sort of a walking brawl.
we have to start somewhere.
so we'll arrange accommodations for you for the next couple of nights.
then when we have something for you to look at, we'll call you in, is that all right?
all right, Officer Harbin will take care you.
officer?
thank you very much.
you really have to piss somebody off to get them to cave in half your skull.
sounds like he specialized in pissing people off.
wonder what broke his leg.
Hey, look at this.
look at the green on his ear.
somebody left some decoration.
home team colors.
great.
Rex, come on.
I got dinner downstairs.
Rex, come on.
let's go. - I'm not hungry.
I know you don't want to hear this right now but you have to trust me.
there will be other girls.
who said this was about a girl?
nobody lies in bed all day listening to depressing music because they have a stomach cramp.
I'm a detective.
I know when people are lying.
then why'd you let me stay home?
I've wanted the occasional day in bed myself.
but you get one free pass and this is it.
tomorrow morning, you're back at school on time.
you understand?
all right, move over.
all right, you want to talk about it?
what?
what, I don't know, whatever happened with Emma.
I think I just need some more time to myself.
okay.
I got to go to work for a few hours anyway.
so there's food on the counter if you need it.
hang in there, kiddo.
it's going to be okay.
I'll see you later.
Hey, it's Emma.
leave me a message.
come on.
just call me back, text me, something.
this place went up really quickly.
the dry cleaning chemicals are very flammable.
victim appears to have died of smoke inhalation.
got her name - Sabina Fernandez.
her neighbor said, uh, she worked here.
so we don't think she could have started this fire?
no, it was definitely arson.
someone played with the fuse box, tried to make it look like a short.
we recovered a piece of plastic tubing that contained some sort of accelerant.
we'll run a chemical analysis, let you know if we find anything that might tell us where it came from.
all right. Thanks.
so what's our next move?
well, you tell me.
well, uh, we check the streets for security cameras, ATMs, any video from the time of the fire.
Yeah, and then?
well, then we interview the victim's family and friends, see if anyone wanted to hurt her.
like boyfriends, husbands...
come on, she's living alone in the back of a cleaners.
if you wanted to kill someone like this, you go to the trouble of setting a fake electrical fire?
she's not the target.
she's just unlucky.
so, an insurance job?
sometimes, if it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, It's the guy with the big knife.
the owner.
Yeah.
what do we have here?
there's a possible reason why.
what do you see here?
a lot of red numbers.
they're bets.
look, it's a ledger.
and you don't write things down in red when you're winning.
how much do you think he owes?
I don't know.
hello.
look that this.
last bet, Seattle over L. A., 100 grand.
well, if he would have bet on L. A., she'd still be alive and we'd both still be home right now.
I don't know.
I have a feeling which ever way the game went, we'd still be working a case somewhere.
so, you haven't said anything, and I haven't brought it up.
the calendar says that your last day is coming up soon.
that's when the movers are coming.
I'll be around; I'll close this case out.
and then what?
you're just gonna pack up your dk and go?
and leave without saying good-bye?
I'm not huge on good-byes.
so what if me and some of the guys put sometng together?
what do mean, "put something together"?
well, after all the time you spent on the job, the least we can do is take over a bar, give you a proper send-off.
maybe.
is that like a "yes" maybe or...?
sure, fine.
good evening.
detective Britten and Detective Vega. LAPD.
we're looking for John Koh.
Sabina was part of our family.
she worked for us for the last seven years.
she opened the store every morning.
she was always the last one to leave.
but she never gave you any indication that she was staying at the property?
no, she...
she was a private person.
Mrs. Koh, could we have a few minutes alone with your husband, please?
we'll be taking a statement from you, too.
thank you.
how do you think this could've happened?
I... caught some neighborhood kids vandalizing the store once.
had to call the police on them.
you think they would have done this on purpose?
no, I suppose not.
are you insured?
Yes, of course.
for how much?
a million.
you recognize that ledger, Mr. Koh?
how much did you owe?
how much does he owe, Detective?
﹩487000.
that's also a lot of money.
detectives, I'm telling you...
well, I'm telling you: Miss Fernandez's death makes this a felony murder case.
and we know the fire was no accident.
now, here's what I think happened.
I think you got yourself in trouble, you dug yourself a deeper andeeper hole and you panicked.
you had no idea Miss Fernandez was living there, and you went for the insurance money.
no, I swear to you, I had...nothing to do with this.
look.
I'll take a lie detector test.
all right?
if that, if that's what you need.
Oh, we can arrange that.
all right, good. I'll do whatever it takes to prove to you that I didn't do this.
let's assume for a second that you're telling the truth.
somebody wanted that insurance money.
so who do you owe?
I can't.
you're scared?
can you imagine how scared Sabina was trapped inside a burning building she couldn't escape from?
this person you described as a family member.
now, let me ask you again.
who do you owe?
solomon Kang?
Yeah. - What is this?
we have a warrant to search your premise in connection with the fire at Koh's Imperial Cleaners.
don't know nothing about that.
do you have any weapons on you?
no.
mind if we pat you down?
you got the wrong guy.
Yeah.
the guy who did this left traces of an accelerant.
turned out to be nitromethane, which is a fuel used for tuner cars.
well, you knew that 'cause you manufacture it right here.
come on, man, I sell that stuff when you came in here.
you arrest me, you might as well arrest everyone with a souped-up ricer in L. A.County.
I don't think that they all take bets from John Koh and I'm sure that they did not break his arm.
look, I'm telling you, I didn't torch his place.
it's not my style.
look, we're talking about reasonable doubt.
unless you put him on the scene, we don't have enough to make the case stick.
for all you know, he didn't actually do it himself.
he may have sent one of his guys.
well, what do we do with him now?
well, then we'll file for the illegal gambling.
while we hold him we'll see what we can find.
don't get more, it'll get plead down to a misdemeanor.
Yeah, but the fuel from his shop started the fire.
now the lab says the chemical signatures are identical.
it's practically a fingerprint.
but Kang told us a lot of people had access to the fuel.
figure out how it got from point A to point B.
until then...you caught a bookie not a murderer.
Thanks, Marco.
let's pull the tapes from the store up the street from the cleaners.
um, but there's no angle on the cleaners.
it's just affic going by.
Yeah. That's what I want to see.
Why?
Kang's got a tuner car place, right?
blends his own fuel.
what do you think his boys drive, Buicks?
there. That one.
that's about the right time frame.
Yeah.
all right.
can we get a plate on it?
no.
he just zips right by in profile.
this is it.
all right.
let's print it out.
custom paint job like that is almost as good as a plate.
let's get patrol to start looking for it.
put together a list of everyone in Koreatown that does custom paint jobs on tuner cars.
where you going?
home to bed.
it's 1:00 a.m.
don't you think I'd like some sleep, too?
fair enough.
dad.
dad.
what's going on?
Emma's lying to me.
there's no way she broke up with me because she caught me staring at Cassie Andersen.
right.
how do I give her one of those polygraph things?
well, um...giving your ex-girlfriend a polygraph is not one of your better ideas.
there's something she's not telling me.
you said you could tell when someone's lying.
how do you do it?
son...
seriously, how do you know?
well...
liars tend to, uh, stiffen up.
you know, their body language, their arms and feet become, their movements become minimal.
they cross their arms or they touch their nose or their throat.
they'll avoid eye contact.
they generally get defensive.
you know, if you're telling the truth you're on the offensive.
um, okay.
Yeah, thanks, this is good...
Hold- Hold on.
wait- Wait a second.
before you go off conducting an interrogation into a breakup, can I ask you...
what do you hope to find?
I just want her to tell me the truth.
Yeah.
no, hold on.
Hey, hold on!
I'll see you tonight.
man, what's going on?
you don't want to know.
all right, what's up?
I think we might've got lucky.
yeah?
Yeah, a motorcycle cop spotted a car in a ditch this morning about 7:00 a.m., and the driver was passed out in the airbag.
I don't know how long he was here, but it did not sober him up.
he still blew a. 28 on the Breathalyzer.
so you got a drunk guy in a ditch.
why is he our guy?
well, his license matches the name on the season ticket holder manifest for G20.
was he even at the game?
well, the odds are pretty good on that one.
you could wait in the car, adjust the seat and mirrors.
be right back with the cones, and, uh, we'll do some parallel parking.
okay.
first you skip homeroom, then you don't answer my calls.
why won't you talk to me?
you know why.
there's no way you broke up with me because...
you saw me talking to Cassie Andersen.
you stare at her all the time.
everyone looks at her.
she's gorgeous and she dresses like she's in a rap video.
please.
tell me to my face that you dumped me because you saw me looking at Cassie Andersen.
is that really why?
Yes.
you're lying.
no, I'm not. - You did it again.
did what? - Lied to me.
how do you know?!
does it matter how I know?
what matters is that I'm right, and we both know it.
Emma, what are you doing?
you won't even talk to me.
Emma, please!
I don't want to talk about it!
and trust me, you don't want to know.
trust me, I do.
please just tell me the truth and I swear I'll leave you alone.
I don't know.
well, he was painted green.
and since your brother had traces of green paint on his body, we were curious if maybe...
he got into a fight with somebody who was painted green.
Yeah, there was this L. A. fan who did the whole green thing.
you know, my brother got in this guy's face, they start shoving each other...
they threw a few punches, but security broke it up really fast.
does that look like the guy?
I mean, I didn't really get a good look at him.
um, I mean, he was green.
okay. Thanks.
what do you do for a job, George?
I'm an investment banker.
no wonder our country's going in the toilet.
our people of high finance are painting themselves green.
who did you go to the game with?
with some buddies from college.
it's why I had the green paint on.
it's kind of a tradition, an alumni thing.
look, guys, what's going on?
it's a little overkill for a DUl, right?
is it?
recognize this guy?
no.
take a good look.
his name is Robert Jones.
never seen him.
funny. When I get in a fight, the guy I'm fighting with usually makes an impression.
don't tell me he's pressing charges.
so, you do remember him.
we got into it in the stands. It was no big deal.
no big deal.
no.
what?
he didn't humiliate you?
in front of your friends? In front of your banker buddies? Your colle buddies? - No.
what happened? You put him down?
did he put you down? Punch each other? You scratch each other? Pull each other's hair?
what was it, George?
did you follow him outside, George?
no.
see, the good news is, he won't be pressing charges.
the bad news is, he was found beaten toeath in the parking lot.
what?
those are some ugly bruises on your knuckles there, George.
and the blood on your shirt - where's that from?
wait. You...You guys think I had something to do with this?
we're just trying to work out how it went from a fistfight in the stands to a dead guy in the parking lot, and you passed out a couple of miles away in a ditch with a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit.
it looks to us a lot like you were trying to leave the stadium in a real hurry.
no. No. I, um...
no? Okay, tell us what happened, George.
I can't.
you... can't?
why is that?
I don't remember.
you don't remember?
that's what you're going with? I mean, seriously.
the amnesia's not the great legal smoke screen you might think it is, George.
you have to come up with an actual story.
look, I was hammered.
blacked out drunk.
but I wouldn't kill someone just 'cause L. A. lost.
Oh, you packing or reading? Movers are coming tomorrow.
just reading up about yesterday's game so I don't embarrass myself in front of the guys at work.
I tell you Vega's organizing a going-away party for me?
I'm amazed you agreed to go.
Why? - 'Cause
I just know how you hate being the center of attention.
Oh, he's like a little puppy dog.
I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
your ears must have been burning.
I don't know about my ears, but my eyes are pretty tired.
I got two hours of sleep.
but I had patrol hit up every paint and body shop in Koreatown, and finally found the one that painted the tuner car that we were lookingor.
well, it's registered to a Korean kid named Jinsung Do.
uh, got some priors - one for gun possession.
got dropped to a misdemeanor because he's a minor.
any connection with Kang? - Yeah.
he's one of Kang's runners.
can we go talk to him?
all right, I'm about to leave the station.
want me to pick you up?
where does he live?
Koreatown... with his grandmother.
Hello?
LAPD. Is Jinsung Do home?
ma'am, I understand you want to protect your grandson, but we have a warrant for his arrest, so if you want him to be safe, I need you to open this door now.
clear.
clear.
he's running. - Take the back.
stop! Stop!
stop!
just get the shot girls.
Yeah, 8:00.
if we had the whole place, it's going down.
all right.
that was Danny.
Danny evidence, Danny motor pool?
evidence.
says his sister works at this restaurant in Hollywood, has this amazing roofeck.
says she's gonna give us a deal to rent it out tomorrow night for the party.
mechanical bull. Does it sound like fun?
sure. - Woman Dr. Brand to Cardiology.
you keep staring at that thing like it's gonna tell you something.
detectives?
he's got a few broken ribs and a subdural hematoma, but he's stable.
can we interview him?
Yeah. Just keep it short.
Thanks.
Hey, Jinsu, remember us?
we have enough evidence linking you to the fire that killed Sabina Fernandez, with a secure conviction for murder.
now, you're a juvie, but you'll get tried as an adult, so, that's gonna get you 25 to life, or a death sentence.
so this is a serious conversation.
it may be your last chance to do something good for yourself for a long, long time.
now, I don't think you acted alone, and I'd like to be able to tell the D. A.that you cooperated.
and maybe he'll go easy on you.
but you have to tell me who hired you.
and don't worry about Kang trying to hurt you or your grandmother.
he's not gonna be able to touch you from prison.
this is your last chance to help yourself.
Kang's not the one who hired me.
no? - No.
okay, then, who hired you?
it's the police.
detectives, please come in. - Thank you.
can I get you some tea?
no, we're good. Thank you.
we have a suspect in custody who confessed to setting the fire.
I think you know him. His name is Jinsung Do.
Kang sends him around every week to settle my account, to pay out or collect.
mostly to collect.
so, you were right about Kang.
he sent Jinsung to burn down my store.
not according to Mr. Do.
but he works for Kang.
but he says he was working for someone else that night.
you want to tell your husband, or shall I?
tell him what?
that you hired Mr. Do to burn down the store.
me? That's crazy.
that you promised him $25, 000 of the insurance money.
he's making this up so Kang doesn't hurt his family.
he's lying!
is he lying about the three calls you made to his cell phone last week?
because that's what the records show.
I understand you were trying to dig your husband out of trouble, save the business.
I suspect you did not know Ms. Fernandez was sleeping on the property, but I promise you that lying to us now will only make things worse for you.
I begged you to stop, but you wouldn't listen.
even when they hurt you, you wouldn't listen.
what other choice did I have?
Sabina died in that fire.
and I'm the one who has to live with that.
if you even call that living.
I keep seeing her face... - Su mi...
again and again! - Ma'am, ma'am.
stop it! - Mrs. Koh, please don't resist!
stop it!
we're placing you under arrest for the murder of Sabina Fernandez.
you have the right to remain silent...
the victim's mom and suiving son are waiting to claim the body, wondering what the holdup is.
frankly, so am I.
I had to pull this from SID.
Why?
cause I think we have the wrong guy.
I'm listening...
we found thio xt ts nehis body, so we assumed it was his, right?
and it's also his team.
look at him.
big, beefy guy.
so what?
so, I knew something was bothering me, and I realized this morning what it was.
put it on him.
that's no way that's his.
okay. So, if it's not the ctim's hat, whose is it?
then will you please call Aunt Sue?
please call her.
it's not gonna do any good... - I'll be right back.
look, guys, I don't know what's going on, but, um, my mother - she's been through a lot, okay, and, um...
and I should take her home.
I'm afraid she'll have a lot more to go through before t day is over.
you can tell your mother whatever you want, but we have to talk to you now.
why am I here?
why do you think you're here, Kenneth?
I don't know.
let me tell you what Detective Bird here thinks happened.
we know your brother, Rob, was violent, that he got in everyone's face.
Yeah, I know, I know; I'm the one who told you that.
Yeah, but you didn't tell us that he was abusive to you.
we have witnesses at the stadium said he was pushing you around.
that must have been humiliating.
must have made you feel small and weak in front of a crowd like that.
sure, he- he was hard on me, but, you know, that- that's what big brothers do.
you said you went tohe car afterwards, you couldn't find it?
I couldn't.
that's not what we think went down.
here.
do me a favor, and, uh, put that on.
put it on, or I'll put it on for you.
it fits, right?
it fits like a glove.
see, we found it next to your brother's dead body.
after you killed him, you grabbed the wrong cap.
no.
I have the same hat.
different sizes.
you took his, you left yours. Kenneth?
we already pulled hair samples.
we know you killed your brother, and you were going to let an innocent man take the fall.
here's the only question left: What do we tell your mother?
she's outside, waiting to take Rob's body home.
when this all comes out, and it will all come out...
we can tell her one of two things.
that she raised a cold-blooded killer.
or that her son made a mistake.
that he's human.
that he was provoked.
that he was bullied, and that for once in his life, he stood up for himself.
I didn't mean to kill him. Okay? I swear I didn't.
during the whole game, he kept slapping me in the back of the head and calling me a girl because I wouldn't stand up for him during those fights with the other fans.
and then after...
after the game was done, it got really bad, you know?
we were... we were walking back to the car, and-and-and I told him to stop, and he wouldn't.
then he pushed me on the ground, he got in my face, and he called me a pussy, and I-I...
I felt this-this loose brick underneath me, and I just...I grabbed it.
and I...
okay.
dad.
Hey. What are you...
what are you doing here? Is everything okay?
can I talk to you?
Yeah, sure. You want to sit down?
I'll get you a soda or something? - Is there, like, someplace more private?
okay, what's going on?
dad, I got her pregnant.
how far along is she?
she lost it.
she never told me.
this whole time, I've been acting like an idiot, and she's been dealing with this and the whole thing.
I - I mean...
it-it's all my fault.
well, you're both responsible.
no, she was always smart about protection and I know when it happened.
in the very beginning, and I didn't have anything, and I...
I told her it would be okay, and she wasn't...
she wasn't sure, and-and I promised her it would be fine.
and it wasn't.
all right, how is she?
I don't... I don't know.
I mean, she says she's fine, but she hasn't told anyone.
she's just been dealing with it alone.
she said she didn't think I could handle it.
and she was right.
what's wrong with me?
there's nothing wrong with you. You're a teenager.
you just reacted like one, that's all.
don't be too hard on yourself.
how do I fix it?
well, you have to let her know that when she needs anything, if she needs anything, that you will be there for her.
I can do that.
let me grab my bag, and I'll get you home.
did you watch the game?
they almost won.
there was this one play, this one field goal, and it missed by a few inches.
just that one little thing.
one tiny, little thing, and this could all be different.
I just texted her, and she said she wants to come over.
Hey, listen, uh, you know how you said that you knew when it happened?
back in the beginning? When was that?
just before mom died.
Emma said she found out just after the funeral.
Why?
where are you going?
I didn't want to wake you.
I got to go out for a while.
the movers are coming up to start packing today.
I know.
I'll be back.
Emma? Emma? Hi.
uh, I'm, um, Michael...
Yeah, Mr. Britten, hi.
I- I was at the funeral.
could we, uh... I'll catch up with you guys after.
Bye. See you later.
what are you doing here?
I want to ask you a question, and it might be completely...
inappropriate.
are you...
by y chance...
how - How did you know?
it's Rex's.
Mr... I- I thought about calling you, I just...
it's okay. It's okay.
it's gonna be okay.
Oh, can you tell them how to get the ladder up into the attic?
guys, can you give us five, please?
just give us a minute?
thank you.
what's going on?
there's something we need to talk about.
you so
I'm the reason
I if and yes what is the single most important thing we've learned from french women.
always
since you refuse to show off your belly.
rub it together.
one thing I didn't have to assume anymore my status with maddie.
we were clearly together, and he was not a vegetarian.
shop it.
you think she's going to ask you to formal. - mom.
this is a busch every barbequarbeque.
so what color dance are you wearing to the dance.
peach.
peach. - son I know you're a good kid.
I want her to have fun.
thankfully my dad had my back.
now I'm not pushing anything but if you decide to take things to the next level make sure you wrap-up the sausage.
awesossumption was the mother of all screw ups.
what's up with the lip statement.
I was no longer that girl, and I was mattie's girl.
and
I want to go to formal with you.
when I tried to tell them formals were an american tradition.
we are chinese.
and they didn't become a billion strong by hanging out in the library.
but now I'm over that over.
I can't believe I'm the only one going - mattie asked you. when.
it was an official invite.
but in the 168 hours since I became mattie's girl I had grown used to his no-nonsense style.
it's for you, T. - oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.
what do you say gorgeous.
I've got nothing else to do.
even though I was going with mattie I had to admit
I would have done with the fantastic invite.
will you go with the formal. - yes.
that's lame.
you realize that will go bad by lunch.
I'm willing to risk it.
Oh I forgot to ask you something.
are you a limo girl.
it wasn't the big question.
but I'm definitely a limo girl.
I'm cool.
so it's cool if we just take my truck. - yeah.
as you but if
and then fingers crossed. Punch marcus in the face.
I always wanted you guys to fight over me.
Ellie.
no. Meleny will not go to formal with you.
wake up and smell the body spray.
Clark is gay.
you're welcome.
the test was brutal.
rub your fingers through my hair and tell me I'm pretty.
you're pretty.
Jenna I got something for you.

he's a farmer.
he's a farmer. Farmer bob mcdonald.

Meleny should be thanking me.

Oh, yeah.
Yes.

I always do all of the cleaning.
it was the first time I didn't mind people staring because it was for the right reasons.
they admired.
I see they printed up new ballot.
apparently there was some last minute changes.
let me guess. You're voting for yourself.
well at least you'll get one vote.
as you are now you could disappear, and no one would notice.
so not true I couldn't disappear.
how did somebody get my letter?
I number 2.
number 4. When you're pretty you're happy, and clearly you're not happy.
and number 6 nobody likes the pitiful.
stop being such a drag.
my signal was alive.
and kicking me in the ass.
you okay.
you sure you want to be seen with the biggest loser of the school.
personally turns out
think you're having a bad day.
I put myself out there, and asked a girl to go to formal, and she said no.
for get about hershey's a bitch.
the guy she's going with has man boobs.
who're you going with.
he was weird. mattie hadn't still told jake about us.
not who's going to wear the crown when you win sophomore princess.
I wouldn't have but I did it before you turned me down.
what are you going to do about the letter.
nothing. The damage has already been done.
Hey. Listen I've been thinking.
what if we blow off the dance, and do something else instead.
dances are pretty lame, right.
is that okay?
sure. - great.
I'll meet you at my truck after school.
how could I be mattie's girl when I was still his secret.
because I was that girl who never stood a chance of going to the formal.
just look at the label.
but I didn't believe it until now.
you were the back up invite.
no, I w no, I was not just the back-up. I was sloppy fourth.
I'm sorry. T.
are you still going to go.
over his dead body well if it makes you feel any better I'm not going either.
why not. - have you seen the ballots.
I
I forgot to vote for you.
holy.
what kind of monster would do something so resident evil.
I'm talking to my friends.
I know you did this and your ass is grass.
what's the matter val. Did you drink some bad soy milk this morning.
stealing it's
and I don't give a hot damn if your dad built a planetarium.
this time you're not going to expel me are you.
maybe. Maybe not.
as far as winter formal is concerned you won't be going.
but I - grab that file and follow me back to my office.
good. Just wanted to be sure you were following me.
welcome to the carrmaggen.
Ricky - what are you going to do. - tell him to go himself.
I will never be anybody's number 4. I deserve better.
I then hey.
Tamara did deserve better, and she wasn't the only one.
it's all over.
I told him to take care.
there is no recovery from that.
I got to walk it off.
I don't need a ride.
is your mom picking you up.
no, I would rather walk home with you.
Why? - because I really want to go to the formal, and I want a limo, and I want you to dress up in a gorilla suit.
or or ok. maybeI want the big ask.
and
I want to take you.
look I was going to ask you at lunch why haven't you told him.
I tried to but - but what.
nothing.
take care.
don't think. Just go with your first instinct.
wi which dress jumps out at you the most.
I was the only one available to try them on.
of course.
because you couldn't wait to see what I want.
there's only one person that looks good in peach, and who might that be?
this dress it will look really pretty on you.
we have to stuff the bust with you.
I'm not going to formal.
and I don't have a date, and my nomination was a joke.
got I got the crappy controller.
dude can you at least not try to suck so much.
I do suck.
probably why jenna rejected me.
you jenna doesn't like you. okay?
get over it already.
- why am I here?
to be a pain in my ass when you stop pmsing don't bother calling me.
I won't.
I had taken great care that I was the daughter that my mom wanted to be with.
but it's and I wasn't going to cry about it.
okay maybe a little.
do you have any tea. ming.
you ever for so into you.
only to find out he's into someone else.
actually three someone else's.
wait. are you not going to red frizzy hair who always wears overalls.
that's leslie gainer.
she is seriously not - and he smells like a litter box.
can I give you a hug?
I'm not really a hugger.
it's okay if - I'll do all of the work.
all right.
bitch.
Oh jake. this is marcus. We're going to formal together.
I know marcus.
what's up man. - what's up.
why are you hugging.
- no hugging.
what's wrong with hugs.
are you okay t. were you crying.
no. I was ugly crying but I got it out of my system.
be right back.
I've been looking for you.
we should go to the dance together.
if you still want to go.
what happened to your date?
didn't work out.
it just happens you have a little competion.
really. - yeah.
with my mom.
we're going to catch a movie.
little mother, son action.
but I think I can blow her off.
I have been seeing a lot of her lately.
I think it's time for us to take a break.
okay, gross.
I'm in.
I just need to know one thing.
what color is your dress.
not peach.
I was leading my renaissance, and going into my golden age, because I wasn't that girl anymore, and I wasn't mattie's girl either.
I was jenna hemisphe hamilton.
someone once said it's choice not chance that determines our destiny.
my head made the choice to end thing with mattie but my heart, my heart was still waiting for the chance that my head might ...
reconsider.
what are you doing here.
I need you to know something.
okay. I'm listening.
I love you.
I really love you.
what? - it's okay. We can share rment you don't have to choose.
because we can all share.
this isn't real.
the ad does seem fake, and creepy.
we can all share. Who wants that.
What're you reading?
the missed connections in our area.
I'm seeing if anybody was too shy to ask me to the formal.
but can you and I can. And it's disturbing.
are you excited for tonight.
I can't believe you're going to your first formal without me.
I know. It's not going to be the same.
wait listen to this.
I've blown it over and over again.
but if you give me one last chance, sand sweep you out on the dance floor.
and finally be your guy.
doesn't that sound like ricky. - or mattie.
don't if but do you think destiny is determined by chance or choice.
chance. 100 percent.
if destiny was by choice I would have developed an ass.
but maybe you're getting really deep, and it's far too really to practice than your morning breath which is rank.
which did I screw up my fate or was my fate supposed to stink.
I'm thinking I want to wear my hair up. - down.
honey, your hair is the best weapon in the fight against your ha hair.
princess's don't have big ears.
Jenna has been nominated for winter present
I wait good.
bad news. I just got off the phone with ming.
she's going tonight.
she this sucks. I'm going to be lone losing.
I - hamilton. - hey.
we can't wear the same color dress.
good call.
can tamara come with us.
sure. I'll see you at 6: 00.
is there anyone here that can do something in the vain of grecian goddess means ga.
with t by my side a good time at the dance was all but in the cards.
poker is not my game. - poker?
I don't know it.
you guys are like - dude. - Call her already.
does mclight have a girlfriend. - He did.
you get your ass handed to you or what.
it wasn't really our fault. - it's never your fault.
but you still got to own up to what she thinks you did.
yeah dude are you a wuss.
ask
she told me to take care.
when she said it was she looking directly at you or was she looking at the ground twirling her hair.
the hair twirl.
signature tell.
it's pretty direct.
give her something she wants.
she wants to go to the formal.
take her.
I can't. The formal is tonight.
so make it happen.
you're a mcgibbon mcgibbon's are winners.
you are right. we are winners.
what happens. - me.
I can't go anywhere like this.
don't panic.
we can fix your head.
but you can't fix my dress.
you were right. It's awful. Happy?
a little but don't fret. Come on.
there's nothing in your closet I'm going to want to wear.
what about this?
you'd let me wear nanna's dress.
special times calls for special circumstances.
try it on.
you know, that dress was especially made for nanna when she was a model.
I used to think if I could look as good as her in it she would love me as much as she loved that dress.
isn't that silly. - yes.
the only time she ever let me wear it to my promise.
you should have seen me trying to fit my big ass belly into
do I look stupid.
you look perfect.
I want you to know that I would never love a dress more than you.
unless it's vintage chanel.
understandable.
now you are the best part of me.
because you're not me.
you're better.
I'm so sorry.
mom. Can't breathe. Got to let go.
okay. I'm sorry. I was just having a moment.
I am entitled one on occasion considering you ruined my figure.
mom, do you think you were meant to be with dad?
I mean if I wasn't here would you have chosen him.
that was never a choice.
jen is girls are here.
if I wasn't going to let fate influence my decision
I wouldn't let some vial letter do it either.
it was time to put my past where it belonged.
in the past.
ming is going with me.
surprise.
Hi.
sidebar.
there is something you want to tell me this is the ellen variety.
going with a girlfriend was the only way my parents would let me go.
if I have to let her feel me up at the end of the night
I'm up for the cause.
girls let's get together.
okay. Now, chins out and down.
dad I think your allergies are acting up again.
no I'm crying.
damn you because now I'm crying.
can you believe we did this.
we raised a beautiful girl.
you're embarrassing jenna. - you're both embarrassing jenna.
it's your date.
can I please speak to jenna.
you just missed . Hershey's on the way to the with her friends.
thank you.
you are good don't sadie
you are forbidden for looking so fabulous.
kitten you need to relax.
I know. It's just sadie undercuts my authority, and I know she's going to crash.
my velvet
come on - go, go on.
J, my girl.
I jake is my date.
all right. you two lovebirds have a good time.
watch the bump and grind. We're trying to keep this shindig pg principal some of these kids are really pushing the boundaries.
I was talking about you.
I wore this to my grandmoth grandmother's funeral. - I know.
we are here way too early.
it's all about arriving early.
that way we get our pictures taken before we get out on the dance floor.
you ladies unlike matty, Jake was a dork, and I was ready to be a dork with him.
do you think I could get one of just the two of us.
okay. - okay.
I'll be right back.
don't yank me. My dress is couture.
I'm doing the best I can you're - so what?
wiggly.
Yeah. it's been fun.
lip gloss?
I noticed you're with jake.
we're just friends.
I don't care. We're not together anymore.
Jenna, you look really pretty.
Thanks. so do you.
what? what was that?
you look really pretty.
help me in so I can slap you.
no. - no?
you're a bitch, and it's your fault jake dumped me.
I was living in the moment and I didn't know if it was by chance or by choice but I didn't care. It was time for me to bust a move.
I'm busy.
listen to me please.
give me one more chance I'll sweep you off your floor.
I'm - it's you. - I know. It's you. It's always been you.
I was just too blind to see it.
where did tamara go?
Ricky is the connections.
Ricky - it's a long story.
look I only have 60 bucks.
if you promise to get me in I can promise it's the gift that keep giving like acne.
look it was a joke.
you having a good time?
Yes. you?
I always have a good time with you.
it wasn'tly what I was thinking.
everything with jake is easy.
everything with you is easy.
do you think things happen to us by chance or by choice.
in what way. - fate.
do you believe in fate.
I don't know but considering you're here with me right now the universe is working in my favor.
maybe the universe was working in my favor too.
everything was as it was meant to be.
because finally the other guy I had been ping over was a distant 40 feet away.
hey man. - hey.
I'm really stoked you made it.
who did you come with.
nobody. There was a girl but I messed it up.
what happened?
you don't want to know. - I do.
well, I was going to take this girl, this great girl and things got complicated, and I was trying not to hurt someone else but I ended up hurting her.
I didn't think she was going to come. I went to her house.
you went to her house.
Yeah. her dad said she.
where is she? - she's with another guy.
dude that sucks.
you should steal her away.
I think it's too late.
what do you think is it too late.
I was confused.
I didn't know if I should listen to my head or my heart.
so I went with my hand.
I'm so sorry.
I think you're right. It's too late.
okay. check, 1,2.
hello. time to announce this year's winter formal court.
okay. Let's get down to some business on some
Dick.
Dick walters, take over.
put the cookie ms. Saxton.
you are to leave immediately.
or what - or I'll have you expelled.
Really? For what.
you know what. stealing jenna's file.
the file isn't missing anymore. isn't it?
I bet my mercedes that you didn't report it stolen.
I did not. well then it's just your word against mine.
Val what are you doing.
Mr. Mishra she just accosted me, and you witnessed it
I didn't witness anything.
I will have you both fired.
go for it.
I bet my camry of your word against ours won't get you very far.
you just been sucker punched.
this is actually mine.
now, for sophomore winter court envelopes please.
got them. Right here. Knew that.
sophomore princess is clark stevenson.
you're welcome. Go girl.
and sophomore prince is mattie mcgibbon.
one door to my heart had closed which meant a new one could open.
I just want to say I share this with you, jenna hamilton.
Oh come on. One more.
what? - you really like to dance?
Yeah.
we're going to hit josh harrison's after party. guys wanna come?
Harrison's parents have a waterbed.
it's up to you.
I think we're going to pass.
let's get our stuff. - okay.
there's something stuck to your back.
like dirty code. - like what?
like... - like there's a note on your back.
Oh my parents are over at my neighbors which means they're getting hammered and they aren't coming home anytime soon.
do you want to come in. - yes.
actually is it okay if you don't come in.
sure.
I mean but I want to take things slowly.
there's no rush.
I'm not going anywhere.
what is it?
tonight is the first night anyone has ever held my hand in public besides my parents.
freak you out. - no.
it just makes me realize what I've been missing.
look what you've done.
I've completely blanked on the alarm so I have to call my parents.
do you want me to stay. - no.
okay. don't be freaked out if I call you when I get home.
I won't. I'll only get freaked out if you don't.
okay. It's me. I'm home and I can't rember the alarm code.
wait. The code is in the junk drawer. Never mind.
someone once said it's choice not chance that determines our destiny.
but it was hard for me to process who would ever choose what I found.
it was chance.
mom.
did you know that you were our number-one associate this month?
no, I didn't.
we were very impressed at the partners' meeting.
we're keeping our eye on you.
wed houlstop wasting time worrying about how it might end, because maybe-- maybe it won't end.
we have a $20-million loan hanging over our heads.
cuts are gonna have to be made across the board.
why do I get the feeling I'm about to be fired?
you're not, but other people will have to be.
we lost ojai as a client.
how?
my brother fired us.
they're in a financial bind. They're trying to save money.
a family in politics" by kitty walker.
did she write that?
you know if you publish this, you're gonna have to resign.
what? What do you mean? -I can't have people on my staff writing books.
but it's completely up to you.
you can't actually do that.
you can't just chuck out the ojai name.
you'll erase our entire family's history.
it's called walker landing.
I'd say the family stays pretty front and center.
Oh, I see. What about brand loyalty, tommy?
people have been buying ojai foods for years.
well, we may lose some customers in the transition, but we will more than make up for that by targeting the higher-end markets.
that's right. We relaunch ojai foods under our brand.
we can raise the prices. We charge more, we make more.
it makes perfect financial sense.
for walker landing, not for ojai foods.
why are you two so against this?
it's like you won't consider anything that will actually get us out from under this colossal debt.
that's not true, tommy.
well, check the numbers.
our profit margins are much higher on wine than fruit.
okay, then let's make more wine.
good, I'm glad that you agree, because we want to convert 500 acres of ojai orchards into a vineyard.
are you kidding? -Why would you rip out 500 acres that's turning a profit and put in a new crop that won't yield for seven years?
that's insane. I won't let you do that.
well, actually, it's the board's decision, not yours.
you're unbelievable.
you just don't stop.
you just keep on encroaching on everything that belongs to this family.
Sarah, enough.
500 acres isn't everything.
no, tommy, but by the time she's finished, they'll be nothing left
not that it'll matter because you're already calling it walker landing.
okay, okay, that's it. I've had it.
where are you going? - Where am I going?
you think I'm gonna sit here and argue with you when you know you and tommy are gonna bring this to the board.
right - You're damn right we are.
the board needs to see that there's a vision that's gonna turn this company around, all right? And this is mine.
and holly's behind me.
well, good luck with that, because you two, you're on yo own.
God, I love being back in new york.
everything is just... alive.
l. A.'S alive...
too alive.
but here, you can walk.
do you know that I went to see four publishers yesterday and I never even got into a car?
how's it going?
well, nothing yet.
you know what? They wouldn't know a good book if it bit 'em in the butt.
have you seen the best seller list lately?
Oh, no, no, no. They-- they're all interested.
I'm just not sure that I am. I have, you know...
a lot to give up.
is robert really gonna make you quit if you publish?
well, yeah, and I happen to agree with him, mother.
I mean, I- I certainly can't work with people that I wrote a book about.
it's just-- and I'm-- I'm just here feeling everything out.
I mean, it's better than sitting around, waiting for the adoption agency to call.
I love your social worker.
she didn't think that dinner was so bad.
of course, it didn't get bad until after she left.
mother, please. Are you seriously still mad at robert?
Kitty, you know what? He completely misunderstood what I was saying.
he-- he accused me of hating your honesty and your outspokenness.
I love that about you.
you have to let it go.
you know, robert hasn't even mentioned it.
he's-- he's too obsessed with our new neighbors and their awful hives.
your neighbors have hives?
well, isn't that petty of him?
they can't help a skin condition.
beehives, mother.
I'm talking about beehives.
Beehives?
it's their hobby or something.
I don't know. They have a lot of bees.
I'm gonna have to call you back, honey.
mom?
mom, it's just a uniform, okay?
I'm not going back to war.
I'm going to work at a recruitment center in south pas.
I don't know why they're making you do that.
I mean, you already served.
you were wounded, for god sake.
I'm still enlisted, remember?
I mean, at least they're not sending me back to iraq.
no, they're making you send other kids to iraq.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
Justin, you look so handsome and clean-shaven.
Hey, hey, I- I thought I was driving you.
well, actually, the recruitment center is right by my new job.
new job?
what, in photography?
uh, no. Actually, I'm-- I'm temping for a dana drew diet center.
well...
that's good, too.
Yeah, turns out we're both working at mini malls. So...
all right, I love you, mom.
it sounds awful.
it doesn't matter how it sounds.
what matters is you agreed to come.
So...I...tomorrow night, you and me, 7: 00, client dinner.
I just-- scotty, the partners have never asked me to step up like this before, okay?
they're all bringing their spouses.
I do not want to be the only one there without a date.
a "date"?
Ah, sorry. Spouse.
so I do really need you there.
if you have made plans with someone else, please reschedule.
okay, fine. - Thank you.
why it so crucial for you to bring a spouse anyway?
because it validates us in the eyes of the client.
if, for some godforsaken reason, someone on this planet does want to love, honor and cherish a lawyer, we can't be all that bad.
I'm so glad we had our commitment ceremony.
I didn't put a ring on your finger for nothing.
and if I do manage to bag these guys, it'll be like losing the ojai account never even happened.
all right, fine.
who are we wining and dining anyway?
core athletics.
you realize I know nothing about sports.
Yeah, which is why I have us both covered.
I made espn one of my preset buttons on the radio months ago.
wow, it's like I don't even know you right now.
we'll be here when you decide.
corporal, come here, would you?
sure.
Hey, have a seat.
uh, yes, sir.
you know, this is the second time today that I've heard you talking about 9/11.
uh, it's the reason I enlisted, sir.
well, it's a noble reason, but that kid was what
12, 13 years old when those towers came down?
he cannot relate to it the same way that you or I can.
you need to speak to him in a language that he clearly understands.
stick to the script.
did you give him the dog tags or the nascar passes?
uh, no, sir.
I, uh, I thought it would be better to, uh, hand him some literature.
it is not your place to question the army's tactics, son.
we went over the protocol.
Yes, sir. I- I just don't think he really understood what he was getting into.
then give him an idea.
mission, honor, brotherhood-- talk to him about that.
make him feel like he's part of something bigger, something that matters.
Yes, sir.
it, uh, it won't happen again, sir.
corporal, I know it may feel like we're asking you to, uh, convince people to go to a place that we never wanna see again.
but our men and women need reinforcements.
do you understand that, corporal?
good.
this guy called while you were busy.
he said he might be, uh, stopping by later.
I don't recognize the name.
maybe it's a potential recruit.
well, let's hope so.
you have another customer.
it was unbelievable.
Tommy just unleashed his inner donald trump.
500 acres!
is that even legal?
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you waiting for me to say something?
'cause I have this weird recollection of being fired from ojai foods.
I didn't fire you. Tommy fired you.
Yeah, which is exactly why I will not speak with him.
Oh, come on. I defended you.
now I need you to help me come up with a response to this.
okay, it takes a two-thirds majority to approve.
mom's a board member, and I think she'd rather jump on the table and open a vein than lose the ojai name.
maybe I should just come up with my own proposal-- kill holly.
I'd kill tommy.
not nearly as satisfying.
which is why I think we would be the perfect firm for you and the rose bowl committee.
the rose bowl? What?
Absolutely. - Kevin?
okay, thank you. - Kevin?
let's--let's talk soon. Thank you.
rose bowl committee?
Yeah, just, uh, just trying to drum up some new clients.
you must be feeling pretty confident not to be focusing on core athletics.
are you ready to land us a multimillion-dollar account?
are you kidding me?
last night, I had a dream I had to recite their latest earnings report verbatim, and I did, perfectly.
I'm a little concerned about their C. E.O.
Ron robinson has a- a reputation for being pretty tough to win over.
right, because he's a perfectionist.
he tries every sneaker personally before they release a new line.
he's-- he's like my mom.
I know exactly how to handle him.
I'm sure you will.
but I've been to a lot more of these dinners, and it's not just about selling the firm.
it's about making that...
that personal connection.
you may want to think about flying solo on this one.
flying solo?
give robinson all your attention.
don't make him compete with anyone else.
I'm sorry.
are-- are you asking me to leave scotty at home?
I'm just saying that sometimes potential clients can be unpredictable.
and you don't want the night to become an uphill battle.
we all want you to become partner, kevin.
you land this deal, you're next in line.
okay.
you will do something about this. this is a public health issue.
all right? There are children involved.
my next phone call is gonna be to the president.
wow, who's getting chewed out, cabinet member, congressman, my mom?
no, it's a neighbor.
he's got some beehives that I want moved.
so you're gonna call the president?
I'm bluffing.
uh, is kitty around?
no, she's still in new york. What's up?
okay, I'll talk to her when she gets back. No biggie.
no, come in. - Nothing. it's fine.
just tell her I, you know
Kevin, you clearly earmarked some time to talk to kitty.
so, you know...
hit me.
you know what?
you may be the perfect person to talk to.
I mean, no one compromises their beliefs more than politicians, right?
I'm so flattered.
go on.
okay, so my boss has asked me to disinvite scotty from a cent dinner.
I guess he doesn't want the client to know that I'm gay.
did he use those exact words?
no, he danced around it like baryshnikov, but we both knew what he watalking about.
the point is, I've become fixated with becoming partner, and I kinda said yes.
but this guy carter-- he's vindictive.
he could easily block my promotion.
sacrificing for the greater good.
welcome to the real world.
so what do I do?
sell out peter to pay paul?
Yeah, I mean, you're pretty much the expert.
Hey, I resent that.
I have never sold anybody out, unless...
of course, I absolutely had to.
Oh, right, like the time you were asked not to mention the fact you had a gay brother.
I never deny that, but I also don't feel the need to grandstand about it either.
Yeah, I've always hated that about you.
Hey, jason's lied about his sexuality for years.
it was his only way to get through seminary, much less find a parish.
Jason ended up serving god.
I'm a corporate lawyer.
then solve it from the inside.
once you get the corner office, nobody from that firm's ever gonna ask somebody to leave their partner at home.
that's it?
the end justifies the means?
not always, but...
you can live a very principled life and not do a damn bit of good for anybody.
why do I feel like either way, I'm still gonna get screwed?
well, there's always a price.
you just gotta figure out whether it's worth it.
first he calls this out of the blue meeting, and now he's late.
Yeah, well, he's probably coming up with some new reasons why our proposal is the wrong way to go.
I doubt it. It wouldn't take this long.
sorry I'm late.
the printer was on the fritz.
what's this?
it's my letter of resignation.
I don't belong here anymore.
what are you talking about?
you've been here forever.
I'm also resigning my seat from the board.
saul, is this a negotiating tactic?
no, holly, it's not.
no, w--hold on.
saul, we've gotta talk about this.
you can't convince me.
this company is changing, and maybe I'm too old to change with it, or maybe I just don't want to.
well, there's gotta be something that we can do.
accept my resignation.
I'm sorry. - Saul.
you can't just leave.
you can't leave me alone while she dismantles everything that my father built, everything that you built.
Tommy's right. They need to make changes.
it was a very practical decision on their part, sarah.
come on, saul. You don't believe that for a minute.
this was not an easy decision for me.
I'm at time in my life when I-- when what, saul?
just because you're coming out, you
you want out of everything?
you got me into this mess.
Where's your loyalty?
I've been loyal to this family for 40 years, sarah.
I was loyal to your father. I was loyal to tommy. I'm loyal to you.
I almost gave up my entire life out of loyalty to this family, so- don't start with loyalty. - Then fight.
stay and fight for this family.
I can't, sarah. I just can't.
Anthony lewis. Nice to meet you.
how are you? I've been looking for you forever.
they said-- they said you'd be working here today.
uh, I'm sorry. Do I know you or...
sort of. I was in th um, the 81st combat team.
we were hit by that bomb in south baghdad last august, by the elementary school.
Ah, you probably-- you probably don't remember. It was a hectic day, so...
no, I,uh, I- I remember.
well, uh, the records, they say that, uh, they say you're the one that pulled me out.
you saved my life, man. Owe you.
no, I was just doing my job.
you medics always say that, man.
well, anyway, look...
um, the wife and I, we don't live too far from here.
so, uh, you know, we thought it might be nice to maybe have you come over.
you know, not that, you know, dinner's much of a thank-you or anything, but...
you know, I- I don't-- I don't know if I can, uh...
Aw, come on, man. The kids...
they'd really like it.
you're kind of a, uh...
I guess you could say you're a heron our family now.
are you sure about this?
Yeah, I think so.
just... going there every day, supporting people and denying myself, I
and then the life that I lived before I...
before you came out?
came out.
no, it seems to me that coming out is something young people do.
Sarah's furious with me.
she thinks I abandoned her.
well, that's ludicrous.
no, it's not. It was in the heat of the moment.
and actually, she has a point. I mean,
I was the one who signed off the deal on golden plum, and I'm the reason that ojai is in this financial trouble.
she's-- she has a right to be outraged.
saul, listen to me.
what happened at ojai happened.
you can't go on blaming yoself the rest of your life.
that's true.
I think maybe I should retire, nora.
I don't need a job.
I need a life.
you need to meet someone.
how do you know I haven't?
have you?
a man can dream, can't he?
don't worry about sarah, all right?
you just keep on dreaming.
okay.
I'm sure this is exactly what you pictured when I said I'd cook dinner.
no, it's fine.
no, it's pretty lame, actually.
I really thought I'd have time to go to the market, but the phones were ringing off the hook.
apparently, taking the breakfast burrito off the menu --not a good idea.
but at least we get free food, and hey, our carbs and proteins are perfectly balanced.
okay, say something, because I'm really sick of having a conversation with myself about diet food.
what? It's good.
no, I'm not talking about the food.
I wanna talk about your day.
it was all right.
all right"? That's it?
Yeah, you know, it was all right.
you know, I don't know what else to say.
well, tell me what happened.
nothing. You know, I,uh, i talked to some high school kids about joining up,
I felt like crap about it, and then I bumped into some guy I was in iraq with, and he asked me to go to dinner, so I said sure.
well, that sounds nice.
you think I could go with you?
I don't know.
why not? I- I've never met any of the guys you served with.
well, he wasn't in my unit.
I just feel weird about bringing someone unannounced, you know?
well, could you call?
Rebecca, why are you so obsessed?
I-- it's just dinner, okay? You don't even know the guy.
Yeah, well, if he's your friend, then i would like to get to know him.
but if this is your way of taking it slow or
Becca, if you wanna come, come.
all right? I don't see what the big deal is.
neither do I.
how's my overworked husband?
overworked.
good news-- you're off the hook for tomorrow night.
I thought everyone was supposed to bring their spouses.
Yeah, they are. But, you know, you were right.
I think it's gonna be awful. And besides, why do we have to be so hetero-normative?
sounds like you're chickening out.
no, not at all.
by the same token, I don't think we have anything to prove.
Kevin, you feel weird about bringing me. Admit it.
I don't feel weird about anything at all.
what? - Kevin...
my boss is worried that if you were to be there with me, the client may become distracted, which is his code for saying "offended,
which is just, I don't know, a pleasant way of saying he's not sure whether this guy likes homos, and he doesn't want anything to stand in the way of the contract.
Oh, my god.
I'm sorry.
I thought you'd be mad.
well, I am, at your boss.
I can't believe he's putting you in this position.
what did you say?
you know, scotty, I am this close to making partner.
look, I can do a lot more from a corner office than I can from a cubicle.
you're not in a cubicle, kevin.
that's a metaphor. It...
Carter all but said if I do this right, I'm there.
does that corner office have a big walk-in closet?
that's not fair. This is one dinner.
I think we both know it's more than that.
so what am i supposed to do?
I've worked my ass off for this firm for years.
if I left now, I'd have to start over.
I'm not asking you to start over.
what are you asking?
I'm asking you to be careful.
look, kevin, you deserve to make partner, but you also deserve to be who you are.
you've been working pretty hard at that, too, remember?
you sure you wanna come in?
you seem intent on waking the neighbors.
I just had dinner with saul.
did he tell you about his sudden retirement?
he told me he was leaving ojai, yes.
do you want some tea? I just made it.
no.
I think you owe him an apology.
Oh, I thought you came over here to commiserate, not to reprimand me.
did you even let him explain?
mom, he sprung this on me at the worst possible time.
I know this is a difficult time for you, sarah, but would you please try to see this from saul's perspective?
he's finally taking this huge step forward in his life.
he needs your support.
mom, he should be supporting ojai.
I needed him at that meeting tomorrow.
did--did he tell you what they wanna do?
Yes. I talked to tommy.
I know about the 500 acres.
and honestly, given the situation, it
it sounds like a reasonable proposal.
reasonable? What about the rebranding, losing the ojai name?
you think that's reasonable, too?
I don't wanna take sides.
mom, you're already taking sides.
you're taking saul's side.
actually, it sounds like you're taking tommy and holly's side.
he deserted me, mom.
you have no idea what it's like to go to work for her every day.
not with her, for her, every day.
are you angry at saul for quitting, or angry at yourself for not?
what are you talking about?
I told you, sarah, don't martyr yourself for ojai.
quit.
I'm a single mother with a mortgage, tuition payments and alimony.
I can't just quit.
then do something else.
you have an M. B.A., Experience
Oh, really, mom?
in this job market, you think I can take that kind of risk?
fine, then it's your choice to stay.
and if you truly believe that tommy is making the wrong decision for ojai, then fight.
convince the board. I'll support you.
but make your own decision, sarah, and don't blame saul for making his.
pick some up where you buy groceries to enjoy at home.
no, no, I'm sure they just didn't hear the bell.
Justin, it's gonna be fine, okay?
sorry.
you guys made it. Great.
how are you?
great, great, great. Come on in.
Hey, everybody.
corporal walker.
you didn't tell me it was gonna be a party.
uh, what are we celebrating?
you're here!
I'm maggie, anthony's wife.
uh, justin. Nice to meet you.
Oh, I know who you are.
uh, this-- this is Rebecca.
we brought you a little somethg. Nice to meet you.
Oh, thank you.
uh, let me show you guys around.
thank you for what you did for my son.
and this is my mom anita, in case you couldn't tell.
thank you. - Nice to meet you.
what's going on?
and, uh, this is everybody else. This is my grandmother.
hello.
this is my, uh, best friend sam.
my brother terrance.
my two boys right here.
look at this.
uh, wow, that's, uh, that's a nice sign.
they've been working on it all day.
they wanted to do something for the man who saved their daddy's life.
what?
we think reapportioning the land and converting into a vineyard is a smart long-term move.
we've been leasing this land from other growers.
this lets us keep up with the demand without the extra cost.
I'd like to get back to the rebranding issue.
Nora, are you really okay with this name change?
I don't know. I...
I can't say it doesn't make me nervous.
people trust ojai products.
when something disappears, I don't know, I move on.
I look for something new.
it makes me nervous, too.
you're already buried in debt.
and down a C. F.O.
I don't know how you all feel, but saul's departure does not exactly give me confidence.
saul felt that it was time for him to retire.
but this decision he made for himself.
it had nothing to do with this proposal.
I think saul would agree that these figures you presented are reasonable but I don't see any room for contingencies if something goes wrong.
I'm sorry, tommy, but this option seems rushed and far too risky for a company in such a precarious situation.
I agree.
I agree this company is in a very precarious situation.
reallocating that much land is very ambitious.
rebranding our ojai products even more so.
but come on.
ambition is nothing new to this company.
my father built ojai on a wing and a prayer.
he didn't have contingencies.
he had a vision.
and he was prepared to take risks because he believed in it.
I-I'd like you to consider, what if william walker was sitting here?
would you be so skeptical?
with all due resct, william's not the one here guiding us.
true.
Tommy is.
my father taught him everything he knew.
now doubt me all you want.
I got us into the deal that put the company in this precarious position in the first place.
and to get out of it, we're gonna need vision, the kind of vision that my father had.
Tommy has it.
I think we should trust him.
I do, and I believe my father would have, too.
excellent choice of wine, carter.
actually, kevin suggested it.
his family's in the business.
Really?
that's so glamorous.
that's what I keep telling ron.
give your gym some glamour.
let people sweat in luxury.
she thinks smoothie bars add luxury.
last time I was at one of your gyms, I drank two of your banana bliss in a row.
I'm actually afraid to go back.
I think I put weight on that day.
I told her-- guys don't want to sit on their asses and drink milkshakes, because that's what they are-- milkshakes at a gym.
how did your family get into wine?
Byrinking it, mainly.
I think my brother actually uses us as quality control.
wise man.
you know, I personally test every athletic shoe before it hits the market.
Really? I didn't know that.
but that's how we are at the firm.
I mean, if you were to sign with us, you'd be guaranteed personal attention at all times.
hope you save some attention for your wife.
Yeah, of course I do.
sorry she couldn't join us.
how long you two been married?
since last may.
Ah, you're still in the honeymoon phase.
give it a year or two, she'll be ruling the roost.
I wouldn't worry about kevin.
I can't see anybody pushing him around.
he's a bulldog when he wants to be.
isn't that right?
that's me.
pretty good save in there tonight.
you know, the, uh, the board voted 5 to 1 in favor of our proposal.
you're welcome.
did you mean what you said in there?
it's what you wanted, tommy.
and I owe you that support, especially since I won't be working here after today.
what?
I'm quitting.
you're kidding, right?
right.
I see.
I overrule you, and now what?
now you're punishing me?
no, tommy.
that vision that I was talking about, I don't have it.
all I see is holly and what she's doing.
you mean, trying to save our company?
it doesn't feel like our company anymore.
Ojai always used to feel like home, and now, for many reasons, some of which are my fault-- it just--it feels like a job.
no, you can't. I won't let you do this.
I've made up my mind.
well, your timing sucks.
I'm sorry.
I can't believe you went to altadena high school.
that's crazy. That's, like, our--our rivals.
is--Oh, god, what's his name? Is coach pays
Paysinger still there?
Yeah, yeah, he, uh, he coaches baseball now, too.
they're finally asleep...
I think.
where did everybody go?
Ah, it was-- it was gettin' late, baby.
Yeah, I think we should...
well, no, no, no, wait.
I- I wanted you, uh, to finish that story. Where were we?
um, did you finally find the convoy?
Rebecca, I don't-- don't-- no, justin.
Anthony promised he'd at least tell me how you saved his life.
look, I don't think anybody wants to talk about it, all right?
no, no, no, no, no.
no, it's cool, it's ol.
I mean, you probably know the story better than I do.
you were conscious the whole time.
Yeah, come on. Tell me.
it was nothing, all right?
it was a hell of a lot more than nothing, man.
Justin, come on. I want
Rebecca, can you just stop, all right?
look, I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry.
I gotta go.
sorry.
maybe you should give him some space.
Hey, you know what? I'll go talk him.
Oh, hi, I just don't know what I did.
it's not you.
it's just that some guys, they just have a harder time...
talking about what happened over there.
Justin has a hard time talking about everything, so, um...
I'm sorry.
Justin left.
what can I get ya?
whatever you got on tap.
I did it.
what?
I am officially unemployed.
I quit.
I quit ojai.
sweetheart...
come in. I'll make you something to eat.
Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't eat.
I could drink.
well, how did tommy take it?
not good.
God.
I feel like I just-- I just got divorced again.
it's not that bad.
and I have no idea what I'm gonna do.
it's gonna be okay.
how do you know?
because I saw you in the boardroom today. You were incredible.
I was? Yes.
I felt that I needed to shore up the board's confidence in tommy.
which is ironic, because...
I don't really have a lot in myself right now.
Oh, sarah, only you could've convinced the board to change their minds like that
not tommy... Certainly not holly.
you have a gift.
sweetheart, I know you feel your life is a disaster right now...
Oh, god!
but it's not. Trust me.
honestly, it's gonna be okay.
I hope you're right.
otherwise, me and the kids are moving in.
well, that would be all right.
don't even joke about it.
all right, all right, all right, all right.
the no vote-- that was you, wasn't it?
no way in hell I was voting to lose the ojai name.
the degree of difficulty is 3. 2
how was the dinner?
well, I've been putting a dent in our tivo backlog, and I'm all the way up to the summer olympics.
did it not go well?
Oh, no, it was the kind of evening every young associate dreams of.
I was the perfect sommelier, I walked them through the advantages of carter, wright and dupress-- so much so, by the end of the night, good ol' ron practically insisted that I take over the account personally.
so you got it?
Yeah, I got it.
but in a moment of faustian proportions,
I pretended to be straight.
wasn't that kind of the plan?
I think it's one thing to leave you at home, but it's certainly another to take advice on how to deal with your new bride.
they thought you were married to a woman.
Yeah, because I let them.
and right now, I practically feel sick to my stomach.
you know, for the first time in my life, I went back into the closet after coming out.
and you were absolutely right.
it's a very dark place.
then don't do it again...
or do, but you can't play the game and second-guess yourself at the same time.
either accept what you did because it'll get you what you want, or go in there tomorrow and tell them you're drawing a line in the sand.
make a decision.
I don't care which one.
you're absolutely right.
and I'm gonna go in tomorrow morning and tell carter exactly what I think.
good, because I actually did care which one you chose.
I feel a whole lot better already.
you wanna watch the rest with me?
you know what? I'm kinda exhausted.
it's the diving competition.
well, I did want to get into some more sports.
where have you been?
what are you doing here?
waiting for you. It's 1: 00 in the morning!
where the hell have you been?
a bar, okay?
and I don't feel like talking about it.
did you drink?
Justin, did you drink?
No! Okay? What, do you want a play-by-play of everything I've done tonight?
excuse me? I have every right to be upset and worried about you right now.
I just spent the entire night wandering around the city with anthony looking for you.
look, I'm sorry, okay?
I, uh, I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry.
and why is it so awful that I want to know how it was for you out there?
I mean, you will not talk to me about iraq.
because I don't want to tell you about it, okay?
because there's the war, then there's you.
they don't mix.
as far as I'm concerned, there's you, and there's me, there's everything in between-- that's a real relationship.
well, I guess we don't have a real relationship, do we?
Why? Because I wanna get to know the guy that I'm dating?
here's a tip-- the guy you're dating is a nobody.
that guy anthony, his-- his family thinks I'm some hero because I saved his life?
you know who's life i didn't save that night?
my friend Charlie.
he died 20 feet away from me, Rebecca.
20 feet away from me!
so how am I supposed to look these kids in the eye that come into the center and convince them that this is where they need to go?
Justin, it's not your fault.
you're not responsible for the choices that other people make in their lives.
you know what? You're right, because I can't control my own life.
okay? Because I'm a loser and I'm an addict, like
no, justin. No, you're not!
I still wake up here and I live with my mother, okay?
because I'm too messed up to worry about my freakin'...
great.
I'm gonna go upstairs and go to sleep, unless you wanna talk about that, too.
you don't have to leave.
I think I should.
I'm sorry.
well, you're up.
Oh, I couldn't hide up there forever.
besides, I miss my mother.
Oh, yeah, right.
so I called my sponsor.
have a meeting today.
you wanna talk about it?
no, but I guess that's part of the problem.
sweetheart, can I say something?
what, that living with my mom is okay?
Yes, that, too.
Justin, you're a good person.
you're honest and brave and kind.
look, I feel like Rebecca has only seen this one side of me, and I'm-- I'm terrified that if she sees this other side, that she's gonna...
she'll what? - She's gonna walk.
she's gonna realize that I'm not good enough for her.
you can't pick and choose the parts of yourself you want Rebecca to see and know.
shutting her out won't help the relationship.
what will?
letting her in.
no, no, the guy needs permits to keep animals on his property, even if they're bees, and he didn't apply for one before moving, so there's your angle.
Yeah, or you could call the president. I'm sure that wouldooork, t.
uh, senator, I have to go. Bye.
I'm not used to being summoned to an associate's office.
what's so important?
I- I just wanted to talk about last night.
well, I just got off the phone with ron robinson.
he's faxing over the retainer right now.
Yeah, yeah, he-- he called earlier to tell me that.
then what's the problem?
I wanna make partner here more than you know.
but a few things happened last night I don't think I handled well.
are you kidding me? You handled it perfectly.
you did exactly what you were supposed to do.
you landed the deal. You should be proud.
look, I have a partners' meeting in five minutes, and I was planning on raving about your performance, so...
if that's all there is...
Yes, sir, that's all.
good.
keep up the good work.
Yeah, all right. Hey, listen, I gotta go. Bye.
I talked to the project manager, who says we can start converting the land in a few weeks.
great.
listen...
about what happened with saul and sarah
I'm really sorry.
are you?
I'm not happy about this.
but, tommy, we did not drive them away.
they chose to go.
Yeah, well, uh, I've been turning a lot ofhings over since then.
however we go about rebranding, whatever logo or angle we use, ojai foods will remain "ojai foods.
but I thought the point was that you wanted to reposition their products in the market?
it is, and we will, but under the same name.
Sarah and saul were right.
this company has history.
it needs to be respected.
I hope you don't have a problem with that.
I'll let the board know what you decided.
you're back.
let me grab this.
Oh, I need food.
I'm starving.
I- I promise you, I am ready to eat my arm.
did you get any offers?
just, uh, just, uh, four.
you're kidding.
there's, uh, there's gonna be a bidding war.
that's incredible!
it is kind of incredible, if I do say so myself.
but I- I don't know what I'm gonna do yet, but I- I do know that you and i need to celebrate.
I have some champagne that I have chilled.
you-- you do?
Hey, I have my own triumphs that I wanna celebrate.
Really?
what are they?
the bees, they're gone.
you're kidding. - No.
Kevin made a call.
Yeah, it turns out that they needed a permit or they didn't have it
what-- whatever. It's over.
well, okay then, here's to kevin.
to kevin.
to jobs we hate.
you're the only one with a job.
Oh, I'm not worried about you, kiddo.
you're a survivor. - So are you.
and I'm sorry about all those things I said.
no, it's okay. - Either of you gonna apologize for firing me?
I know. It was tommy.
it's gonna be so weird not going into ojai.
mm, tell me about it.
40 years.
okay.
to ojai.
to ojai.
to ojai.
look, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
no, don't, please.
no, I know you don't like to think about it.
Becca, I think about it all the time.
can I, uh, can I come in for a second?
Yeah, of course.
no dana drew, huh?
I wanted comfort food.
I'm sorry.
you don't have to apologize.
I do have to apologize.
I'm gonna call anthony and apologize to him, too.
but I just...
I just wanted to talk to you first. But...
I'm just afraid that you're not gonna like what you hear.
try me.
all right. So...
last night, when we were at anthony's house and his
his family is being so nice and-- and treating me like I just saved their son's life, um...
you did.
the entire time I'm looking at anthony,
I just wish I could snap my fingers and trade his life for charlie'S.
how ugly is that?
of course you wanted to save him. He's your friend.
that's not the type of guy charlie was.
he would've taken a bullet for anyone.
where-- where was he from?
he was from boston.
what was he like?
he was a bigude. He was...
he was like an offensiveineman.
no way.
there was this, uh, this group of iraqi kids that...
used to use him like a ride, like disneyland, you know, they'd just be all over him.
there was this one kid, and we used to-- we used to call him stretch,
deep down in that thing you call a subconscious, you know how many Cylons there are left in the fleet.
eight! There are eight!
corporal Vener reports the former President's missing.
missing? Two men down, cell's empty.
damn it.
glad to see you, Madame President.
well, Mr. Zarek, it would seem the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
go find Earth.
let's go home.
we have found Kobol.
and we retrieve the Arrow, we will open the Tomb of Athena.
and we will find the road to Earth.
no one's gonna believe this crap.
and anyone that wants to make a suicide run to Kobol, let them.
astral Queen has Jumped away.
24 ships, sir.
that's almost a third of the fleet.
they're going to follow Roslin to Kobol...
to their death.
18, 000 souls aboard the 24 ships that joined President Roslin's rebellion, sir.
that's over a third of the people in the fleet.
give me a breakdown. What have we lost?
uh, 9,500 souls from Gemenon.
6, 250 from Caprica.
not who.
what?
I'm not interested in people who decide to join up with a religious fanatic and a terrorist.
that's their business. Now, what have I lost?
12 transports, seven freighters, three construction platforms, a private cruiser, and a mining ship, sir.
monarch was a blow.
we can't afford to lose mining ships, not in our situation.
and then there's the collateral damage.
morale is down throughout the fleet.
the press is going wild.
families are being split apart.
don't talk to me about family.
I support the President completely.
and my only priorities are the preservation of her safety and the completion of this mission.
that's all well and good, but he's still Adama's son.
when push comes to shove, how do we know he'll be willing to stand
if it were not for him,I would still be in a Galactica jail cell.
I trust him completely.
and this subject is closed.
and what about Galactica?
they--they know where we are!
they could jump in here at any time and charge us all with treason or destroy this ship with a flick of the wrist.
we're not entirely defenseless!
some of our ships are armed!
we should take steps to arm the others just in case.
just in
just in case we want to commit suicide!
if Galactica wants to take us down, there is nothing we can do about it, nothing.
and nobody in this room should be under any illusions on that count.
at this point, it's my firm belief that Commander Adama has let us go.
lieutenant Thrace will return.
she will have the Arrow of Apollo.
and it will help us find our way to Earth.
and exactly how long should we wait for her?
I mean, maybe we should go down to the surface now.
go down now and start looking for this tomb.
I wouldn't be too eager.
there may still be Cylons present.
and some of us will die down there.
the scriptures tell us that any return to Kobol carries with it a cost...in blood.
people...
I realize that there are still many unanswered questions here.
Yes, it is a big one.
but it is our foretold destiny.
and I, for one...am not going to waver from it now.
if there is anyone here who does not have the stomach for this mission, you are welcome to rejoin Commander Adama's fleet.
it Jumped into dradis range about two minutes ago.
no Colonial transponder, and it's too large to be Thrace's Cylon Raider.
and no response to our hails?
not a peep, Tom.
it's either a Cylon vessel, or it's a Raptor Scout from Galactica.
either way, we should shoot first and ask questions later.
okay.
the Adriatic is in weapons range, and she's got ship-to-ship missiles.
Tom, that thing is moving fast.
if we're gonna shoot it down, we'd better shoot it down!
shoot what down?
do I have to repeat myself?
Madame President, we have a security situation.
that's all.
she wasn't talking to you.
there's an unidentified ship making its way towards us.
it's too big to be the Lieutenant's Cylon Raider.
it's in weapons range.
the Adriatic has to fire her missiles now.
we need a decision, Madame President.
civilian vessels, civilian vessels.
this is Starbuck. Do you read?
do you read?
say again, this is Starbuck.
is anybody getting this?
initiate docking.
good to see you too, Captain.
remind me to send you to the brig later.
Yeah, well...
lieutenant.
Lee, there's something I need to tell you.
Lee, wait!
don't you frakking move!
stop! She's with us!
drop your weapon, sir.
drop your weapon.
gentlemen, I'm only going to say this once.
captain Adama, and--what is your name?
lieutenant Agathon.
used to be Sharon's ECO.
I thought you were dead, Helo.
you a Cylon, too?
don't even.
all right, here's what we're going to do.
you're going to lower your weapons.
am I being perfectly clear?
what about Sharon?
she will be taken to a holding cell where she will remain unharmed.
okay. How about it, Apollo?
should we do what the nice lady says?
she's the President of the Colonies, you moron.
and yes, we're gonna do exactly what she says.
lower your weapons.
now.
thank you.
now put that thing out the airlock.
what?
we don't keep Cylons around here, Lieutenant.
what the fuck?
you said you weren't gonna hurt her!
Hey, Helo! Listen to me!
one of those things put two rounds into my father's chest.
it wasn't me! Adama was shot?
Yes.
you missed a few catastrophes while you were away.
please tell me he's alive.
after two emergency surgeries,
Cottle managed to save him.
it wasn't me!
Kara! For the love of gods!
Sharon--this Sharon saved our lives back on Caprica. Tell them!
tell them!
I know how to find the Tomb of Athena!
do you?
Kobol's a big planet!
you don't find the Tomb, you don't find Earth!
listen to her, for gods' sakes!
listen to me!
Madame President.
tell them to wait a minute.
thank you.
Mr. Zarek, is there some place where that...young woman and I can speak?
I can arrange that.
it's great to see you again, Kara.
thanks for bringing in the trash.
looks like we missed all the fun.
no.
mueller's not a bad choice.
he did a tour as a squadron XO
mueller's a malcontent.
I know you don't want to hear this, but there is not another Apollo in this bunch.
and we do have to pick a new CAG.
commander Adama.
lieutenant Birch, please come in.
thank you for coming on such short notice.
of course, sir.
I'm sure you're aware there's been a change in the fleet.
several of our pilots departed.
I was just thinking that we need a new CAG to step up.
absolutely, sir.
who's it going to be?
congratulations, Captain.
it's you.
thank you, sir.
just want you to know you have total support of myself and this entire crew.
is that not right, Colonel?
Absolutely. Get your log book.
Congratulations.
I'm honored, Commander.
I won't let you down.
and, sir, I'd just like to say that I was a tremendous supporter of your son, Captain Adama.
he was--he was a great leader, sir.
a ship is a family.
it works on trust, understanding, and love.
I love everyone on this ship as much as I love my son.
Galactica is still a family.
you're an important part of that family.
do you understand?
Yes, sir.
thank you, George.
I'm sure you'll do a fine job.
what the hell?
you got me in here jawing about picking a new CAG, and you've already made your choice.
I just wanted to see if you and I were on the same page or not.
I beg your pardon? I guess we're not.
you guessed right.
you're telling me that kid is leadership material?
we have very few choices.
he's the best. He's a good man, Saul.
he's honest and he's loyal.
we need a little bit of that around here right now.
well, it's your call. I'll support it.
commander, will you be commenting today regarding the split of the fleet?
commander, will you be answering questions regarding the split of the fleet?
can you make any comments regarding Laura Roslin and how you feel about the split?
does this thing work?
please be seated.
allow me to make a statement, please.
please allow me to make a statement.
please be seated.
thank you very much.
if you don't already know, the fleet has been divided.
please!
we share the grief of friends lost.
and the resources we've sacrificed will present new challenges for all of us.
but if we stay together, we will rise to the occasion as we have before.
And?
questions.
Yes.
uh, you know the coordinates, the whereabouts of President Roslin's rebellion.
do you intend to put the fleet back together?
first of all, Laura Roslin is no longer President.
she relinquished that role when she suborned mutiny aboard this ship.
next question.
but--but Commander!
commander! Commander!
Yes, go ahead.
since the fleet has been divided
commander, you haven't answered my question yet.
we have lost no one that cannot be replaced by someone loyal...who has chosen to remain with us.
this is the fleet.
thank you.
commander! Commander!
commander, is there any truth to the rumor that there is no Earth, it doesn't exist, and you just made it up?
what the hell kind of question is that?
it's been all over talk wireless, newsletter circuit, hand mail.
freedom of the press is not a license to slander.
broadcasting that kind of garbage is the quickest way to find yourself in a holding cell.
and that goes for all of you. -We're done here.
are you a dictator?
what happened to free speech, Commander?
get your hands off of me.
why don't you calm down?
remind me not to do that again.
always looked easy enough when Roslin did it.
there was an old footbridge...over the Euclid River.
I used to go there when I was a boy.
watch the fish try and swim upstream.
they were mesmerizing.
I envied them.
unaware as they were of the...wider complexities and challenges of life.
you're beginning to see human beings as we see them.
what I am beginning to see are Cylon faces.
everywhere I look.
Sharon told me there were eight Cylons left in the fleet.
why didn't I ask her who they were?
if that idiot hadn't have shot her...
and why is it when things go wrong, they go wrong so well?
Gaius, you get yourself far, far too worked up about these things.
they do have it easy, don't they?
they?
why are you talking to me like I'm not one of them?
in some ways you never were.
you have a path, you will be spared their fate.
for once, Gaius, you can stop manipulating the world and let destiny take its course.
if there's one thing we know about human beings with certainty...
they are masters of self destruction.
because I love him.
and because I'm carrying his child.
Oh, I see. That explains it.
you're not here because you mean us any harm or because you're a programmed enemy of humanity.
you're here because you had an affair with one of our Raptor pilots. Listen to me.
I'm listening to you. That's my mistake.
I'm listening to a Cylon.
I am here because I chose to come here.
and I know you don't believe me.
but hear this...
even if you find the Tomb, even if you find the map, and even if you find Earth, the price you pay will be too high.
I'm not interested in your prophecies.
I know that there is a Cylon force on Kobol.
I know it's dangerous.
and I have little doubt that you are communicating everything I say even as we speak.
it doesn't work like that! I'm not wired in!
Sharon, it's simple.
what I need to know, and what might keep you alive is exactly how to find the Tomb of Athena.
get me a map, and I will do my best to tell you how to get to the Tomb.
no, you'll do better than your best.
I want to know where it is.
and you either know or you don't.
we all know about the Tomb.
I can show you the path.
I don't know how long the path is or exactly where it leads to, but I can tell you...
she claims to love Lieutenant Agathon.
she says she loves the baby she's carrying.
who cares what she says?
you can't believe a word any of them
the Scrolls of Pythia do speak of a lower demon who helped the people in a time of crisis.
more superstition.
I've told her that unless we return from Kobol with a map to Earth that Lieutenant Agathon will be put out the airlock as a Cylon conspirator.
is that true?
doesn't matter if it's true, she believed it.
she saved them, both of them.
she didn't have to.
she could have saved her child and let them die.
why didn't she?
because I believe that she's telling the truth about one thing.
she thinks she's in love.
even if it's software instead of an emotion, it's real to her.
she wants her baby to live.
she wants Agathon to live.
we used that.
this is not the way that I thought things were going to go down.
I knew they'd be suspicious, but...
they're human.
it's the way you are.
has anyone stopped to consider that the reason Sharon knows so much about Kobol is because it's a Cylon trap?
I've done more than consider it.
it's clearly possible we're facing a trap.
captain Apollo has already warned us that Cylon encounter in the region is probable.
has Captain Apollo managed to tell us anything we don't already know?
he is in charge of this mission.
he is second in command only to myself.
I strongly encourage you to remember that, Mr. Meier.
whatever the risks, whatever the consequences,I am going anyway.
I am committed.
captain Birch, Galactica.
you are cleared for target exercise maneuvers, acknowledge.
Galactica, leader. Wilco.
CAG to all vipers.
we're initiating our precision firing exercise as planned.
hotdog, you're first up.
Kat on deck.
leader, Hotdog. Clear to target.
executing eyeball run on three, two, one!
away!
fuck! Winged it!
come on, people, I know this is just a drill, but let's look sharp out there.
hotdog, I know you can do a lot better.
let's try it again.
see if you can put the next one in the X-ring.
cleared hot!
ready for another pass. Leader, Kat.
I'm confirming that I'm cleared for my attack run.
am I clear?
leader, Hotdog.
executing eyeball run.
affirmative, you're clear.
rolling in! Weapons hot.
leader, Kat. Did you say all clear?
I said all clear.
okay, roger that!
let's go, baby.
here we go with three, two, one!
away!
leader, beginning strafing run.
Kat, what are you doing?
you said I'm clear for my attack run!
hotdog is cleared for his attack run.
what? Hotdog?
back off, Kat! Now now now now!
Oh, my gods!
Oh! Oh, crap.
damn, bang on! Did you see that? Whoo!
bang on?
hotdog, you fucking idiot!
you almost got me killed!
what are you talking about?
birch, you said I was clear.
all Vipers, this is leader.
repeat, all Vipers, this is leader.
report back to Galactica.
report back to Galactica.
fuck!
I know how you feel.
I get it.
but I didn't shoot him. It wasn't me.
you're all the same.
you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
then maybe I'm done talking.
I think there's been enough of that today.
you are the last one who should be telling me what to do.
after the stunt you pulled?
stealing the Cylon Raider and then tearing ass back to Caprica?
yeah,'cause you're clearly the poster boy for military discipline, huh?
you know what?
you have no idea what happened to me on Caprica.
so while you're standing here polishing off your halo, consider for a second that you may not have any damned idea what the hell you're talking about.
captain.
what Roslin's doing is reckless.
we have our own fleet now.
how much longer do we need to keep playing follow the leader?
we have a fleet because people believe Roslin's going to lead them to Earth.
she's a fraud. You don't believe her, do you?
no, but I believe in the power of myth.
I'm not interested in risking our lives any more than you are, but she's clearly not gonna be talked out of this.
and in the end, President or prophet, it doesn't really matter.
she still needs a commander.
a man in charge of the fleet.
the man with the guns makes the rules.
what if she decides you're not the man to be in charge of the fleet?
what if she has someone else in mind?
someone already close to her.
like a certain captain.
let's say you're right.
that on some level...based on their belief in the scriptures, the fleet needs Laura Roslin in order to stay in line.
so we do what we must in order to keep Roslin safe on the surface of Kobol.
but...
but...
you're right.
you're absolutely right.
how could I not have seen that?
I wanna set this fleet on a path to freedom.
of course.
I wanna deliver unto them the liberty we've promised.
we are far from daylight, my friend.
the scriptures say some of us will die on Kobol.
one man in particular.
you're a little left off the center line.
striker, reset your delta to . 35, acknowledge.
how's my approach speed?
your angle vectors are too steep. Adjust.
I repeat, your angle vectors are too steep. Adjust.
what is he doing?
tell him to cut his speed.
what is it this time? I'm glad you're here.
birch is coordinating the ship for refueling.
but he's making a mess out of what should be the simplest op in the book!
how long has he been at it?
about four hours now.
sir, he's too green.
he's blowing the approach and the docking speeds.
he's missing the drogues. He's bunching the lines.
it's a mess out there.
as you know, this isn't the first screw-up.
Yes, I know.
I realize that he is your guy, but...
but he's no Apollo.
I was wondering when we'd finally get a little R & R around here.
Oh, boy.
can I have my ball back?
what, I can't hold it?
can I have my ball back, please?
Where'd you get a pyramid ball, anyway?
Caprica.
can I have my ball back, Lee?
Yeah, sure.
keep it.
Hey, come on, Kara.
for frak's sake, I'm just kidding around.
all right, here, it's all yours.
you can take your ball and go home now.
the whole thing's stupid anyway.
what's up with you, Kara? Anything you wanna talk about?
Nope.
it must have been hard, being back on Caprica.
being home.
probably saw some tough things back there.
anyway, tomorrow this whole thing is gonna end, one way or another.
we find the Tomb or we don't.
we find a way to Earth or we don't.
I just want you to know, Kara, that I'm your friend.
I love you.
if there's anything you wanna talk about, anything you wanna get off your chest, then I'm here for you.
Anyway...whenever you wanna talk, just let me know.
what was that middle part again?
hmm? What do you mean?
did you say you love me?
lee Adama loves me.
no, all I meant was
no, seriously, very sweet. You love me.
no, you love me.
you can't take it back. There's no take-backs.
you're dreaming it, Kara.
you love me. You're dreaming it.
you love me. Dreamer.
okay.
this is Striker.
I'm having trouble getting a visual on the fueling spar. Can you redirect?
gas station, Striker's coming in way too hot.
you gotta back off your delta, like right now.
didn't you hear us? Back off your delta.
you're too close! Are you listening?
okay. Abort!
abort the op.
recall the ships.
galactic to all ships involved in fuel unrep.
abort mission.
say again, abort fuel unrep.
Raptors return to base. Acknowledge.
Wilco, Galactica. Aborting mission.
damn it!
Roger that.
Galactica says abort approach.
adjusting angle vectors full reverse.
striker, you're still on a collision course.
put your helm hard left, full reverse thrusters.
back off, back off. Look out!
Galactica, Emit. Tankers intact.
no wireless contact, but it's in a lateral spin.
and there does appear to be some damage.
away rescue team.
tell them to board the tanker, restore navigational control.
here.
you never know when you might need to defend yourself.
here we go.
and the blaze pursued them.
and the people of Kobol had a choice, "to board the great ship or take the high road "through the rocky ridge
and the body of each tribe's leader "was offered to the gods in the Tomb of Athena.
Yes, precisely.
and the "great ship" was the Galleon that departed from here, where we're standing.
and it took the founders of the 13 colonies "to their destiny.
and those that didn't board the Galleon "took the high road...
the rocky ridge that led to the Tomb.
let's move.
the path is supposed to be marked by gravestones.
there's something there.
wait!
get back! Get back! Get back!
Yeah.
switch.
nice one.
ammo!
Lee, no!
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
not bad.
damn.
it's interesting.
betrayal has such a powerful grip on the mind.
it's almost like a python.
it can squeeze out all other thought.
suffocate all other emotion until everything is dead except for the rage.
I'm not talking about anger.
I'm talking about rage.
I can feel it.
right here.
like it's gonna burst.
feel like I wanna scream.
right now, matter of fact.
if I may say something?
speak your mind, Dee.
I don't think the problem is that you've been betrayed.
I think it's that you feel helpless.
you were shot, you were injured.
you couldn't do anything.
don't make excuses for me.
and when you finally had a chance to do something
sorry I did this.
you let us down.
you let us down.
you made a promise to all of us...to find Earth, to find us a home.
together.
it doesn't matter what the President did or even what Lee did, because every day that we remain apart is a day that you've broken your promise.
the people aboard those ships made their own decision.
it was their decision, not mine.
thank you, Petty Officer.
you may leave now.
you asked to talk to me, sir...
maybe because you think that I don't have anything to say.
but I do.
it's time to heal the wounds, Commander.
that'll be enough.
people have been divided.
I said, that's enough.
they're separated from their parents.
a cost in blood.
let's go, Madame President.
Mr. Gaeta.
I want to see all recon material on Kobol immediately in my quarters.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
I'm putting the fleet back together.
I'm putting our family back together.
this ends now.
this is the battleship Pegasus to the ship claiming to be Galactica.
Pegasus.
how could that be?
the entire fleet was destroyed.
Admiral Cain.
on behalf of the officers and the crew of the Pegasus, welcome back to the Colonial Fleet.
the Cylon fleet is composed of two base ships, about a dozen or so support ships, and one large vessel that we are still unable to identify.
that's this large ship here that I'm interested in.
I'm going to integrate the crews.
I thought you said you had no desire to interfere with my command.
I'm Laird, Pegasus Deck Chief.
you're an-- aeronautical engineer.
I was.
so, you're really a civilian?
I was on the Scylla and we got picked up by the Pegasus.
things happen.
how much time do I have?
weeks.
a month at the outside.
will I be able to work?
unless the cancer goes to your brain.
that happens, you'd
we have our own Cylon prisoner.
she's obviously been abused... tortured.
will you help her, Gaius?
you really wanna get close?
you gotta use the stealth ship we constructed aboard Galactica.
carbon composite.
it's gonna be hard as hell to see Andradus.
Starbuck... you're off this mission.
is that a surveillance package?
go get the Blackbird.
take some pretty pictures of our Cylon ship.
who the hell's this Thorne?
lieutenant Thorne, sir.
your little robot girl is in for quite a ride.
get away!
don't you frakkin' move! Don't move!
they've been found guilty on all counts.
she's gonna execute them both for murder and treason.
Galactica's launching Vipers and a raptor.
why are you launching Vipers?
I'm getting my men.
launch... the alert Vipers.
Galactica, Kat
I got inbound Pegasus Vipers coming right at me.
request instructions.
you've gotta let them defend themselves.
we should turn our main batteries on Pegasus.
Galactica, Kat-- request weapons free.
we need your help.
Kat, Galactica-- do not fire unless fired upon.
I repeat, do not fire unless fired upon.
Galactica, Kat!
they're really frakking with us out here.
Galactica, Hot Dog.
one of them just pulled into my kill slot.
viper 21, I'm right behind you.
hot Dog, watch your six, he's right behind you.
the base of action, come on!
gods damn frakkers!
okay, we're going to have to break your course now.
Narcho, Pegasus-- do not fire first.
stinger, Pegasus
you are ordered to relieve Captain Adama of duty and aid an attack mission on Galactica.
your weapon, Captain.
you're relieved.
permission to go aft. Granted.
I swear, this guy's gonna shoot at me.
he's right on top of me.
come on, break.
frak me!
they're all over us!
Galactica, request weapons free!
they're coming around for another head-on pass.
repeat, request weapons free!
come on, Starbuck.
tell me you're out there somewhere.
what the hell?
Starbuck...
here, what the hell is going on?
dradis contact.
single bogey and it's nearly on top of us.
identify.
no transponders, no recognition codes, it has to be a Cylon raider, sir.
Admiral, sir, this has gotta be a raider.
how the frak did it get in so close without being detected?
I don't know, sir, I assure you, it came out of nowhere.
right.
recall the Vipers.
bring the ship about.
and prepare to engage the enemy.
all Pegasus Vipers, all Pegasus Vipers, emergency recall.
there's a Cylon Raider right on top of you.
attention all Galactica Vipers, you've got a Cylon Raider comin' right at you.
there you are, you bastard.
on my lead!
quick right, full power, X-axis climb!
Starbuck to all Vipers
do not fire...
repeat, do not fire!
I am a friendly, okay?
we're all friendlies.
so, let's just...be friendly!
that's no raider, that's that stealth ship of yours.
who's flying it? It wasn't cleared to launch.
you got me, I'm just a passenger back here.
Galactica, Kat.
it's the Blackbird, Galactica.
repeat, it's the Blackbird.
what the hell is the Blackbird doing out there?
all pilots, hold fire
it's Starbuck.
she launched in the Blackbird a couple hours ago.
said she was running flight tests for Admiral Cain.
that doesn't sound likely.
another one of her crazy ass stunts.
thank the gods.
you can say that again.
get me Pegasus.
this is Pegasus Actual, go ahead.
you can either stand down or we can start shooting at each other.
it's your call.
Admiral.
wait, one.
we're receiving a download, Admiral.
that is the Cylon fleet.
are these from our recon mission?
no, sir. The recon mission was aborted.
these are from Blackbird.
Thrace.
she took off and did the whole recon mission alone.
my gods, look at these shots, Jack.
she put her nose right up their backsides and they never even knew it.
Admiral...
we still have Commander Adama on the line, and our fighters are still requesting instructions.
should they resume the attack?
all right, joint recall.
both ships stand down to Condition Two.
then I want you to report to me directly, in person.
I have no intention of cooling my heels in your brig.
fine.
neutral ground, Colonial One.
no aides.
be there in 15 minutes.
stand down, Condition Two.
there you are.
let's start this by admitting an ugly truth.
what happened out there today was the result of failure in leadership of everyone in this room.
we are the leaders of this fleet.
as such, we need to set an example.
we cannot continue to let the conflicts between
let's just cut through the handholding, shall we?
two of his men murdered one of my officers while protecting a Cylon.
they're guilty, they admitted it.
and under regulations,
I have complete authority to try, convict, and sentence them.
and you and I both know that the penalty for that crime is death.
Admiral, surely...
the spirit of the law requires something more here than summary executions.
is this what the two of you have been doing for the past six months?
debating the finer points of colonial law?
guess what, we're at war!
and we don't have the luxury of academic debate over these issues.
you wanna cut through it, fine.
you have Pegasus, he has Galactica.
two heavily armed, very powerful warships.
now, I am sure that Pegasus would prevail in any fight.
I wouldn't count on that.
but certainly, there'd be heavy damage and you'd take significant casualties.
so you can go out there and fight it out with Galactica or you can compromise.
and those are the only two options on the table, period.
how the two of you have survived this long, I will never know.
all right.
lieutenant Thrace has sent me detailed recon information on the Cylon fleet.
I want that fleet.
and I need Galactica to get it, so I'm willing to go this far.
I'll suspend the executions until after the attack.
and I want them back on Galactica.
I don't give a damn what you want.
you frakking lucky you're not staring at your own warrant.
the destruction of the Cylon fleet will take priority over all other considerations.
after that, we will meet back here and we will resolve this issue.
thank you.
stand at ease, Lieutenant, and come forward.
seems you've had quite a day.
I'm promoting you to Captain.
I'm making you commander of the Pegasus air group.
you're promoting me.
I need a CAG with guts and initiative to plan and lead the attack on this fleet.
now, I thought Stinger was that man.
but he managed to let Captain Adama contact you and pull off that fly-by stunt right under his nose, so, he's out.
and Captain Adama, sir?
truth be told, I came this close tohrowing him in the brig.
but Iouldn't exactly charge him and not you, so I just revoked his flight status.
I want him on my team, sir.
and do you always get what you want?
most of the time... sir.
good.
me, too.
all right, you can have him.
I hear you want to return to Caprica.
Yes, sir.
we have people back there still alive.
Yes, and they deserve to be saved.
I absolutely agree.
in fact, I will go one step further and I will say that our ultimate goal is that we should return to the 12 colonies and kick the Cylons the frak out of our homes.
what do you think of that, Captain?
I think that's the best idea I've heard all day, sir.
I afraid this can only end one way.
you've got to kill her.
what the hell are you talking about?
like she said, let's cut through it.
the two of you were willing to go to war today.
do you think she's going to step down from that?
she's going to bide her time and hit you the first chance she gets.
that's a given.
I hate to lay this on you, Bill, but she is dangerous.
and the only thing that you can do is to hit her before she hits you.
I'm not an assassin.
no.
you're not an assassin, you are a colonial officer who's taken an oath to protect this fleet.
what do you think that she is going to do with the civilian fleet once she has eliminated you?
you know I'm right.
you just don't want to face it.
so the whole world's gone mad.
your fluid and electrolyte levels are stable.
but I think the baby's going to be fine.
you do have a cracked rib, though.
hairline fracture, which means it's gonna hurt like hell for a while.
but, I'm not seeing any signs of permanent damage from the attack.
the attack.
is that what we're calling it now?
they were not from the Galactica.
they were from the Pegasus.
so what?
what about Helo and the Chief?
I heard a rumor they're going to be executed.
I'm not going to let that happen.
how are you going to do that?
isn't Admiral Cain in command?
that happened to you
as unforgivable.
happened aboard my ship, on my watch.
and it's my responsibility.
so I just want you to know that I personally apologize.
see that she's okay, then back into her cell.
aren't we supposed to be dead?
everyone said execution in an hour, it's been at least two.
I'm not complaining.
so.
just how many different kinds of stupid are you?
more than we can count.
what's going on, Captain.
good news-- you're not dead... yet.
bad news-- it's a delay, not a pardon.
there's a big Op coming up, and the firing squad's on hold till it's over.
the old man went to the mat for you guys on this one.
and then some.
we were this close to a shooting war with the Pegasus.
frak me.
what the hell's going on?
thought the Cylons were the enemy.
now it's us.
what's wrong, Gaius?
nothing.
nothing.
I suppose I just...
lost interest.
in me?
no, not in you, in...
in this.
in this place, I...
I suppose I just don't really miss it anymore.
you know what I miss?
sports.
you're joking.
no.
I used to go the pyramid court just before game time.
scalp two tickets.
if I timed it right,
I'd just be sitting down at the horn.
sit back...
let the energy of the crowd flow over me.
waves and waves of emotion.
like an electric current.
why did you get two tickets?
one for me, and one for you.
I know I'd never get you to go.
pyramid was far too lowbrow for you, but...
I always liked to feel that you were there with me.
I see that you got it to eat.
that's progress, I suppose.
can you get it to roll over... beg?
see what it can make of these.
you know this thing used to sit in our mess and eat our food, and listen to our stories.
didn't you?
you just sat there...
listening to us, pretending to be our friend.
didn't you?
Admiral, please!
any... physical contact with the subject will only help to set my efforts back at this point.
find out about that ship.
I want to die.
will you help me do that?
will you kill me, please?
I'm just still getting up to speed on the way you do things around here.
but I'm reasonably sure that we can have all our birds in the air for the attack thing, sure.
I mean, yes, sir.
thank you, chief.
Cally.
Laird's not military, is he?
no, sir.
he was a civilian aeronautical engineer on a ship called the Scylla.
civilian?
do you know how he got on the Pegasus?
scuttlebutt is that the Pegasus used to have a civilian fleet, but something happened to them.
thank you.
Laird's ship was the Scylla.
Scylla was, ...
civilian transport.
we found her and a few other civvies about a week after the attack.
they were good ships.
FTL drives and weapons even.
a lot of potential spare parts that we could use on Pegasus.
so... the Admiral made a decision.
military needs are a priority.
you stripped them.
you stripped the ships for parts?
sweet mother of Artemis.
how much equipment did you take?
you take their jump drives?
left all those people marooned out there.
no, not all.
Admiral Cain looked over the passenger list and she made a decision about who was valuable and who wasn't.
Scylla was the toughest.
Laird and 15 other men and women, they were all traveling with their families
wives, husbands, children.
the selectees...
they refused to go.
there was resistance.
so the order came down to shoot the family of anyone who refused to come.
so we did.
two families, we put them up against the bulkhead.
and we shot them.
a CAG's work is never done.
how ya doing?
you mean apart from being, demoted?
finding myself working for one of my pilots?
great.
never better.
you know I had nothing to do with that, right?
never thought you did.
I, just checked in on Helo and Tyrol.
they're hanging tight for now.
good.
help me plan this op.
I've been staring at this roster.
you wanna just carry on?
as if nothing's happened?
Lee, she's in command what do you want to do?
there's nothing we can do.
I thought you might like a fresh set of clothes.
were you aware of your true nature as a Cylon when you boarded the ship?
or would you describe yourself as a sleeper agent?
I knew what I was.
I was a soldier.
I-I had a mission, I carried it out.
I thought that when it was done I was going to die.
that you would kill me.
then I
then I would download into a new body...
be reborn.
but you didn't kill me.
the things you did to me.
what they did to you was wrong.
evil.
but I'm not one of them.
you have to believe me.
things are going to get better for you.
from this moment on.
I promise.
I don't want things to get better.
I want to die.
but you know you can't die.
you do know that, don't you?
your consciousness will merely transfer and you'll wake up in another body.
not if you destroy that.
what, this
this ship?
tell me.
what's so important about this ship?
the Cylon's call this their Resurrection Ship.
at the moment, we are too far away from the Cylon home world for the normal downloading process to work, which is why they built this ship.
it contains the entire apparatus necessary for Cylon resurrection.
now this ship has been traveling with the fleet trailing Galactica for the last several months.
so it's a safety net?
a place where they fall back to when they die.
and if they lose their safety net?
then any Cylon who dies out here would be dead.
as in, really dead.
I daresay they won't like that.
no, sir.
they might even stop chasing us.
why risk getting killed if you can't just wake up all nice and cozy in a brand-new body?
doctor, I think you just identified the most important ship in the galaxy.
have good days and bad days.
but don't look so worried, I'm not dying today.
sorry.
what can I do for you?
you were right about Cain.
Pegasus had a civilian fleet with her.
15 ships.
Cain stripped them.
for parts, supplies... people.
I wish I could say I was surprised, but it's who she is.
she's playing for keeps, you've gotta do the same.
what's gotten into you?
you've become so bloody-minded.
I know that as long as Cain lives...
your survival is at risk, I know that.
what can I get you?
a new body.
perhaps, one of those young Cylon models from the Resurrection ship.
I can't see you as a blonde.
you'd be surprised.
we'll see you tomorrow?
commander.
she won't hesitate to kill you.
you know, when we get outta here...
I'm going to make some changes.
like what?
me and Sharon.
it's done.
I mean, really done,
I can't do it anymore.
I mean don't get me wrong.
Lt, what we did, I would do again in a heartbeat.
but I've gotta let it go.
I so thought I had let go.
I know what you mean.
you?
me.
what?
you think I don't have second thoughts sometimes?
you think I don't wonder if I'm losing my frakkin' mind?
I'm in love a woman I know isn't a woman.
I'm having a baby that's
that's what?
half machine?
you really do love her, don't you?
Yes, I do.
and I can't let go of it.
but if you can...
let it go.
our primary objective is a vessel named Resurrection by the Cylons.
it's guarded by two base stars which have been following us throughout this sector.
our plan, simply put, is to let them find us.
we will wait in this system here and appear to be conducting mining operations.
when the Cylons launch the raiders,
Galactica and most of the civilians will Jump away.
a small group of civilians will be left behind.
to the Cylons, they'll appearto be having trouble with their FTL drives and attempting to escape at sub-light speed.
the Cylon raiders pursue the civilian decoys pulling the raiders farther away from the Cylon base stars as they can.
once the raiders have beendrawn off by the decoys,
Galactica and Pegasus willump in and attack the base stars.
while I Jump in, in the Blackbird stealth fighter and take out the FTL drives on the Resurrection ship, preventing it from Jumping away.
why not have the stealth ship carry nukes and destroy it right at the start?
an simulations on that.
we determined that the Cylons would detec the nuclear warheads and destroy the stealth ship before it got within weapons range.
Galactica and Pegasuswill take on the and our attack squadrons wion go after the Resurrection ship itself.
how many squadrons?
all of 'em
is there a problem, Commander?
suit yourself.
I've gone over the details and I'm satisfied.
I want your CAG to stay and help me.
answer some of my questions.
one hour, Thrace.
Yes, sir.
stay focused, son.
Jack, I want to transfer a detachment of Marines to Galactica.
and I want you to handpick them.
completely reliable.
completely loyal.
razors.
laon for you, Kara.
anything for you, you know that.
don't accept too quickly.
you won't like this one.
I don't like it.
but I've decided that it has to be dony
I'm transferring you to Galactica, as well.
I'll tell Adama that you're there to be my eyes and ears.
he'll hate it.
he'll think you're my spy and try to freeze you out of decision-making.
but he'll accept it.
now I want you to stay in CIC throughout the attack. e
stay with Adama.
after the attack is completed and you've accounted for your pilots
I want you to land your bird on the Pegasus to report directly to CIC.
you'll take Lee with you.
position Marines in key areas throughout the ship and keep a squad posted just outside CIC.
there'll the normal chaos and emotiona high after the attack.
they'll be slapping each other on the back, ating the victory.
they'll keep their guard down.
security will be lax.
I will ask for you over the wireless.
I will call you directly, and when I have you on the line and you hear me give the command, emmcute Case Orange...
when you hear me say downfall...
you are to signal the Marines to terminate Adama's command.
starting with Adama.
I want you to pull out your weapon and shoot Admiral Cain in the head.
this is the battleship Pegasus to the ship claiming to be Galactica.
Pegasus.
how could that be?
the entire fleet was destroyed.
Admiral Cain.
on behalf of the officers and the crew of the Pegasus, welcome back to the Colonial Fleet.
the Cylon fleet is composed of two base ships, about a dozen or so support ships, and one large vessel that we are still unable to identify.
that's this large ship here that I'm interested in.
I'm going to integrate the crews.
I thought you said you had no desire to interfere with my command.
I'm Laird, Pegasus Deck Chief.
you're an-- aeronautical engineer.
I was.
so, you're really a civilian?
I was on the Scylla and we got picked up by the Pegasus.
things happen.
how much time do I have?
weeks.
a month at the outside.
will I be able to work?
unless the cancer goes to your brain.
that happens, you'd
we have our own Cylon prisoner.
she's obviously been abused... tortured.
will you help her, Gaius?
you really wanna get close?
you gotta use the stealth ship we constructed aboard Galactica.
carbon composite.
it's gonna be hard as hell to see Andradus.
Starbuck... you're off this mission.
is that a surveillance package?
go get the Blackbird.
take some pretty pictures of our Cylon ship.
who the hell's this Thorne?
lieutenant Thorne, sir.
your little robot girl is in for quite a ride.
get away!
don't you frakkin' move! Don't move!
they've been found guilty on all counts.
she's gonna execute them both for murder and treason.
Galactica's launching Vipers and a raptor.
why are you launching Vipers?
I'm getting my men.
launch... the alert Vipers.
Galactica, Kat
I got inbound Pegasus Vipers coming right at me.
request instructions.
you've gotta let them defend themselves.
we should turn our main batteries on Pegasus.
Galactica, Kat-- request weapons free.
we need your help.
Kat, Galactica-- do not fire unless fired upon.
I repeat, do not fire unless fired upon.
Galactica, Kat!
they're really frakking with us out here.
Galactica, Hot Dog.
one of them just pulled into my kill slot.
viper 21, I'm right behind you.
hot Dog, watch your six, he's right behind you.
the base of action, come on!
gods damn frakkers!
okay, we're going to have to break your course now.
Narcho, Pegasus-- do not fire first.
stinger, Pegasus
you are ordered to relieve Captain Adama of duty and aid an attack mission on Galactica.
your weapon, Captain.
you're relieved.
permission to go aft. Granted.
I swear, this guy's gonna shoot at me.
he's right on top of me.
come on, break.
frak me!
they're all over us!
Galactica, request weapons free!
they're coming around for another head-on pass.
repeat, request weapons free!
come on, Starbuck.
tell me you're out there somewhere.
what the hell?
Starbuck...
here, what the hell is going on?
dradis contact.
single bogey and it's nearly on top of us.
identify.
no transponders, no recognition codes, it has to be a Cylon raider, sir.
Admiral, sir, this has gotta be a raider.
how the frak did it get in so close without being detected?
I don't know, sir, I assure you, it came out of nowhere.
right.
recall the Vipers.
bring the ship about.
and prepare to engage the enemy.
all Pegasus Vipers, all Pegasus Vipers, emergency recall.
there's a Cylon Raider right on top of you.
attention all Galactica Vipers, you've got a Cylon Raider comin' right at you.
there you are, you bastard.
on my lead!
quick right, full power, X-axis climb!
Starbuck to all Vipers
do not fire...
repeat, do not fire!
I am a friendly, okay?
we're all friendlies.
so, let's just... be friendly!
that's no raider, that's that stealth ship of yours.
who's flying it? It wasn't cleared to launch.
you got me, I'm just a passenger back here.
Galactica, Kat.
it's the Blackbird, Galactica.
repeat, it's the Blackbird.
what the hell is the Blackbird doing out there?
all pilots, hold fire
it's Starbuck.
she launched in the Blackbird a couple hours ago.
said she was running flight tests for Admiral Cain.
that doesn't sound likely.
another one of her crazy ass stunts.
thank the gods.
you can say that again.
get me Pegasus.
this is Pegasus Actual, go ahead.
you can either stand down or we can start shooting at each other.
it's your call.
Admiral.
wait, one.
we're receiving a download, Admiral.
that is the Cylon fleet.
are these from our recon mission?
no, sir. The recon mission was aborted.
these are from Blackbird.
Thrace.
she took off and did the whole recon mission alone.
my gods, look at these shots, Jack.
she put her nose right up their backsides and they never even knew it.
Admiral...
we still have Commander Adama on the line, and our fighters are still requesting instructions.
should they resume the attack?
all right, joint recall.
both ships stand down to Condition Two.
then I want you to report to me directly, in person.
I have no intention of cooling my heels in your brig.
fine.
neutral ground, Colonial One.
no aides.
be there in 15 minutes.
stand down, Condition Two.
there you are.
let's start this by admitting an ugly truth.
what happened out there today was the result of failure in leadership of everyone in this room.
we are the leaders of this fleet.
as such, we need to set an example.
we cannot continue to let the conflicts between
let's just cut through the handholding, shall we?
two of his men murdered one of my officers while protecting a Cylon.
they're guilty, they admitted it.
and under regulations,
I have complete authority to try, convict, and sentence them.
and you and I both know that the penalty for that crime is death.
Admiral, surely...
the spirit of the law requires something more here than summary executions.
is this what the two of you have been doing for the past six months?
debating the finer points of colonial law?
guess what, we're at war!
and we don't have the luxury of academic debate over these issues.
you wanna cut through it, fine.
you have Pegasus, he has Galactica.
two heavily armed, very powerful warships.
now, I am sure that Pegasus would prevail in any fight.
I wouldn't count on that.
but certainly, there'd be heavy damage and you'd take significant casualties.
so you can go out there and fight it out with Galactica or you can compromise.
and those are the only two options on the table, period.
how the two of you have survived this long, I will never know.
all right.
lieutenant Thrace has sent me detailed recon information on the Cylon fleet.
I want that fleet.
and I need Galactica to get it, so I'm willing to go this far.
I'll suspend the executions until after the attack.
and I want them back on Galactica.
I don't give a damn what you want.
you frakking lucky you're not staring at your own warrant.
the destruction of the Cylon fleet will take priority over all other considerations.
after that, we will meet back here and we will resolve this issue.
thank you.
stand at ease, Lieutenant, and come forward.
seems you've had quite a day.
I'm promoting you to Captain.
I'm making you commander of the Pegasus air group.
you're promoting me.
I need a CAG with guts and initiative to plan and lead the attack on this fleet.
now, I thought Stinger was that man.
but he managed to let Captain Adama contact you and pull off that fly-by stunt right under his nose, so, he's out.
and Captain Adama, sir?
truth be told, I came this close tohrowing him in the brig.
but Iouldn't exactly charge him and not you, so I just revoked his flight status.

you do have a cracked rib, though.
hairline fracture, which means it's gonna hurt like hell for a while.

the attack.
is that what we're calling it now?
they were not from the Galactica.

I heard a rumor they're going to be executed.

more than we can count.
what's going on, Captain.
good news-- you're not dead... yet.
bad news-- it's a delay, not a pardon.
there's a big Op coming up, and the firing squad's on hold till it's over.
the old man went to the mat for you guys on this one.
and then some.
we were this close to a shooting war with the Pegasus.
frak me.
what the hell's going on?
thought the Cylons were the enemy.
now it's us.
what's wrong, Gaius?
nothing.
nothing.
I suppose I just...
lost interest.
in me?
no, not in you, in...
in this.
in this place, I...
I suppose I just don't really miss it anymore.
you know what I miss?
sports.
you're joking.
no.
I used to go the pyramid court just before game time.
scalp two tickets.
if I timed it right,
I'd just be sitting down at the horn.

will you kill me, please?
I'm just still getting up to speed on the way you do things around here.
but I'm reasonably sure that we can have all our birds in the air for the attack thing, sure.
I mean, yes, sir.
thank you, chief.

and if they lose their safety net?
then any Cylon who dies out here would be dead.
as in, really dead.
I daresay they won't like that.
no, sir.
they might even stop chasing us.
why risk getting killed if you can't just wake up all nice and cozy in a brand-new body?
doctor, I think you just identified the most important ship in the galaxy.
have good days and bad days.
but don't look so worried, I'm not dying today.
sorry.
what can I do for you?
you were right about Cain.
Pegasus had a civilian fleet with her.
15 ships.
Cain stripped them.
for parts, supplies... people.
I wish I could say I was surprised, but it's who she is.
she's playing for keeps, you've gotta do the same.
what's gotten into you?
you've become so bloody-minded.
I know that as long as Cain lives...
your survival is at risk, I know that.
what can I get you?
a new body.
perhaps, one of those young Cylon models from the Resurrection ship.
I can't see you as a blonde.
you'd be surprised.
we'll see you tomorrow?
commander.
she won't hesitate to kill you.
you know, when we get outta here...
I'm going to make some changes.
like what?
me and Sharon.
it's done.
I mean, really done,
I can't do it anymore.
I mean don't get me wrong.
Lt, what we did, I would do again in a heartbeat.
but I've gotta let it go.
I so thought I had let go.
I know what you mean.
you?
me.
what?
you think I don't have second thoughts sometimes?
you think I don't wonder if I'm losing my frakkin' mind?
I'm in love a woman I know isn't a woman.
I'm having a baby that's
that's what?
half machine?
you really do love her, don't you?
Yes, I do.
and I can't let go of it.
but if you can...
let it go.
our primary objective is a vessel named Resurrection by the Cylons.
it's guarded by two base stars which have been following us throughout this sector.
our plan, simply put, is to let them find us.
we will wait in this system here and appear to be conducting mining operations.
when the Cylons launch the raiders,
Galactica and most of the civilians will Jump away.
a small group of civilians will be left behind.
to the Cylons, they'll appearto be having trouble with their FTL drives and attempting to escape at sub-light speed.
the Cylon raiders pursue the civilian decoys pulling the raiders farther away from the Cylon base stars as they can.
once the raiders have beendrawn off by the decoys,
Galactica and Pegasus willump in and attack the base stars.
while I Jump in, in the Blackbird stealth fighter and take out the FTL drives on the Resurrection ship, preventing it from Jumping away.
why not have the stealth ship carry nukes and destroy it right at the start?
an simulations on that.
we determined that the Cylons would detec the nuclear warheads and destroy the stealth ship before it got within weapons range.
Galactica and Pegasuswill take on the and our attack squadrons wion go after the Resurrection ship itself.
how many squadrons?
all of 'em
is there a problem, Commander?
suit yourself.
I've gone over the details and I'm satisfied.
I want your CAG to stay and help me.
answer some of my questions.
one hour, Thrace.
Yes, sir.
stay focused, son.
Jack, I want to transfer a detachment of Marines to Galactica.
and I want you to handpick them.
completely reliable.
completely loyal.
razors.
laon for you, Kara.
anything for you, you know that.
don't accept too quickly.
you won't like this one.
I don't like it.
but I've decided that it has to be dony
I'm transferring you to Galactica, as well.
I'll tell Adama that you're there to be my eyes and ears.
he'll hate it.
he'll think you're my spy and try to freeze you out of decision-making.
but he'll accept it.
now I want you to stay in CIC throughout the attack. e
stay with Adama.
after the attack is completed and you've accounted for your pilots
I want you to land your bird on the Pegasus to report directly to CIC.
you'll take Lee with you.
position Marines in key areas throughout the ship and keep a squad posted just outside CIC.
there'll the normal chaos and emotiona high after the attack.
they'll be slapping each other on the back, ating the victory.
they'll keep their guard down.
security will be lax.
I will ask for you over the wireless.
I will call you directly, and when I have you on the line and you hear me give the command, emmcute Case Orange...
when you hear me say downfall...
you are to signal the Marines to terminate Adama's command.
starting with Adama.
I want you to pull out your weapon and shoot Admiral Cain in the head.
deep down in that thing you call a subconscious, you know how many Cylons there are left in the fleet.
eight! There are eight!
corporal Vener reports the former President's missing.
missing? Two men down, cell's empty.
damn it.
glad to see you, Madame President.
well, Mr. Zarek, it would seem the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
go find Earth.
let's go home.
we have found Kobol.
and we retrieve the Arrow, we will open the Tomb of Athena.
and we will find the road to Earth.
no one's gonna believe this crap.
and anyone that wants to make a suicide run to Kobol, let them.
astral Queen has Jumped away.
24 ships, sir.
that's almost a third of the fleet.
they're going to follow Roslin to Kobol...
to their death.
18, 000 souls aboard the 24 ships that joined President Roslin's rebellion, sir.
that's over a third of the people in the fleet.
give me a breakdown. What have we lost?
uh, 9,500 souls from Gemenon.
6, 250 from Caprica.
not who.
what?
I'm not interested in people who decide to join up with a religious fanatic and a terrorist.
that's their business. Now, what have I lost?
12 transports, seven freighters, three construction platforms, a private cruiser, and a mining ship, sir.
monarch was a blow.
we can't afford to lose mining ships, not in our situation.
and then there's the collateral damage.
morale is down throughout the fleet.
the press is going wild.
families are being split apart.
don't talk to me about family.
I support the President completely.
and my only priorities are the preservation of her safety and the completion of this mission.
that's all well and good, but he's still Adama's son.
when push comes to shove, how do we know he'll be willing to stand
if it were not for him,I would still be in a Galactica jail cell.
I trust him completely.
and this subject is closed.
and what about Galactica?
they--they know where we are!
they could jump in here at any time and charge us all with treason or destroy this ship with a flick of the wrist.
we're not entirely defenseless!
some of our ships are armed!
we should take steps to arm the others just in case.
just in
just in case we want to commit suicide!
if Galactica wants to take us down, there is nothing we can do about it, nothing.
and nobody in this room should be under any illusions on that count.
at this point, it's my firm belief that Commander Adama has let us go.
lieutenant Thrace will return.
she will have the Arrow of Apollo.
and it will help us find our way to Earth.
and exactly how long should we wait for her?
I mean, maybe we should go down to the surface now.
go down now and start looking for this tomb.
I wouldn't be too eager.
there may still be Cylons present.
and some of us will die down there.
the scriptures tell us that any return to Kobol carries with it a cost...in blood.
people...
I realize that there are still many unanswered questions here.
Yes, it is a big one.
but it is our foretold destiny.
and I, for one...am not going to waver from it now.
if there is anyone here who does not have the stomach for this mission, you are welcome to rejoin Commander Adama's fleet.
it Jumped into dradis range about two minutes ago.
no Colonial transponder, and it's too large to be Thrace's Cylon Raider.
and no response to our hails?
not a peep, Tom.
it's either a Cylon vessel, or it's a Raptor Scout from Galactica.
either way, we should shoot first and ask questions later.
okay.
the Adriatic is in weapons range, and she's got ship-to-ship missiles.
Tom, that thing is moving fast.
if we're gonna shoot it down, we'd better shoot it down!
shoot what down?
do I have to repeat myself?
Madame President, we have a security situation.
that's all.
she wasn't talking to you.
there's an unidentified ship making its way towards us.
it's too big to be the Lieutenant's Cylon Raider.
it's in weapons range.
the Adriatic has to fire her missiles now.
we need a decision, Madame President.
civilian vessels, civilian vessels.
this is Starbuck. Do you read?
do you read?
say again, this is Starbuck.
is anybody getting this?
initiate docking.
good to see you too, Captain.
remind me to send you to the brig later.
Yeah, well...
lieutenant.
Lee, there's something I need to tell you.
Lee, wait!
don't you frakking move!
stop! She's with us!
drop your weapon, sir.
drop your weapon.
gentlemen, I'm only going to say this once.
captain Adama, and--what is your name?
lieutenant Agathon.
used to be Sharon's ECO.
I thought you were dead, Helo.
you a Cylon, too?
don't even.
all right, here's what we're going to do.
you're going to lower your weapons.
am I being perfectly clear?
what about Sharon?
she will be taken to a holding cell where she will remain unharmed.
okay. How about it, Apollo?
should we do what the nice lady says?
she's the President of the Colonies, you moron.
and yes, we're gonna do exactly what she says.
lower your weapons.
now.
thank you.
now put that thing out the airlock.
what?
we don't keep Cylons around here, Lieutenant.
what the fuck?
you said you weren't gonna hurt her!
Hey, Helo! Listen to me!
one of those things put two rounds into my father's chest.
it wasn't me! Adama was shot?
Yes.
you missed a few catastrophes while you were away.
please tell me he's alive.
after two emergency surgeries,
Cottle managed to save him.
it wasn't me!
Kara! For the love of gods!
Sharon--this Sharon saved our lives back on Caprica. Tell them!
tell them!
I know how to find the Tomb of Athena!
do you?
Kobol's a big planet!
you don't find the Tomb, you don't find Earth!
listen to her, for gods' sakes!
listen to me!
Madame President.
tell them to wait a minute.
thank you.
Mr. Zarek, is there some place where that...young woman and I can speak?
I can arrange that.
it's great to see you again, Kara.
thanks for bringing in the trash.
looks like we missed all the fun.
no.
mueller's not a bad choice.
he did a tour as a squadron XO
mueller's a malcontent.
I know you don't want to hear this, but there is not another Apollo in this bunch.
and we do have to pick a new CAG.
commander Adama.
lieutenant Birch, please come in.
thank you for coming on such short notice.
of course, sir.
I'm sure you're aware there's been a change in the fleet.
several of our pilots departed.
I was just thinking that we need a new CAG to step up.
absolutely, sir.
who's it going to be?
congratulations, Captain.
it's you.
thank you, sir.
just want you to know you have total support of myself and this entire crew.
is that not right, Colonel?
Absolutely. Get your log book.
Congratulations.
I'm honored, Commander.
I won't let you down.
and, sir, I'd just like to say that I was a tremendous supporter of your son, Captain Adama.
he was--he was a great leader, sir.
a ship is a family.
it works on trust, understanding, and love.
I love everyone on this ship as much as I love my son.
Galactica is still a family.
you're an important part of that family.
do you understand?
Yes, sir.
thank you, George.
I'm sure you'll do a fine job.
what the hell?
you got me in here jawing about picking a new CAG, and you've already made your choice.
I just wanted to see if you and I were on the same page or not.
I beg your pardon? I guess we're not.
you guessed right.
you're telling me that kid is leadership material?
we have very few choices.
he's the best. He's a good man, Saul.
he's honest and he's loyal.
we need a little bit of that around here right now.
well, it's your call. I'll support it.
commander, will you be commenting today regarding the split of the fleet?
commander, will you be answering questions regarding the split of the fleet?
can you make any comments regarding Laura Roslin and how you feel about the split?
does this thing work?
please be seated.
allow me to make a statement, please.
please allow me to make a statement.
please be seated.
thank you very much.
if you don't already know, the fleet has been divided.
please!
we share the grief of friends lost.
and the resources we've sacrificed will present new challenges for all of us.
but if we stay together, we will rise to the occasion as we have before.
And?
questions.
Yes.
uh, you know the coordinates, the whereabouts of President Roslin's rebellion.
do you intend to put the fleet back together?
first of all, Laura Roslin is no longer President.
she relinquished that role when she suborned mutiny aboard this ship.
next question.
but--but Commander!
commander! Commander!
Yes, go ahead.
since the fleet has been divided
commander, you haven't answered my question yet.
we have lost no one that cannot be replaced by someone loyal...who has chosen to remain with us.
this is the fleet.
thank you.
commander! Commander!
commander, is there any truth to the rumor that there is no Earth, it doesn't exist, and you just made it up?
what the hell kind of question is that?
it's been all over talk wireless, newsletter circuit, hand mail.
freedom of the press is not a license to slander.
broadcasting that kind of garbage is the quickest way to find yourself in a holding cell.
and that goes for all of you. -We're done here.
are you a dictator?
what happened to free speech, Commander?
get your hands off of me.
why don't you calm down?
remind me not to do that again.
always looked easy enough when Roslin did it.
there was an old footbridge...over the Euclid River.
I used to go there when I was a boy.
watch the fish try and swim upstream.
they were mesmerizing.
I envied them.
unaware as they were of the...wider complexities and challenges of life.
you're beginning to see human beings as we see them.
what I am beginning to see are Cylon faces.
everywhere I look.
Sharon told me there were eight Cylons left in the fleet.
why didn't I ask her who they were?
if that idiot hadn't have shot her...
and why is it when things go wrong, they go wrong so well?
Gaius, you get yourself far, far too worked up about these things.
they do have it easy, don't they?
they?
why are you talking to me like I'm not one of them?
in some ways you never were.
you have a path, you will be spared their fate.
for once, Gaius, you can stop manipulating the world and let destiny take its course.
if there's one thing we know about human beings with certainty...
they are masters of self destruction.
because I love him.
and because I'm carrying his child.
Oh, I see. That explains it.
you're not here because you mean us any harm or because you're a programmed enemy of humanity.
you're here because you had an affair with one of our Raptor pilots. Listen to me.
I'm listening to you. That's my mistake.
I'm listening to a Cylon.
I am here because I chose to come here.
and I know you don't believe me.
but hear this...
even if you find the Tomb, even if you find the map, and even if you find Earth, the price you pay will be too high.
I'm not interested in your prophecies.
I know that there is a Cylon force on Kobol.
I know it's dangerous.
and I have little doubt that you are communicating everything I say even as we speak.
it doesn't work like that! I'm not wired in!
Sharon, it's simple.
what I need to know, and what might keep you alive is exactly how to find the Tomb of Athena.
get me a map, and I will do my best to tell you how to get to the Tomb.
no, you'll do better than your best.
I want to know where it is.
and you either know or you don't.
we all know about the Tomb.
I can show you the path.
I don't know how long the path is or exactly where it leads to, but I can tell you...
she claims to love Lieutenant Agathon.
she says she loves the baby she's carrying.
who cares what she says?
you can't believe a word any of them
the Scrolls of Pythia do speak of a lower demon who helped the people in a time of crisis.
more superstition.
I've told her that unless we return from Kobol with a map to Earth that Lieutenant Agathon will be put out the airlock as a Cylon conspirator.
is that true?
doesn't matter if it's true, she believed it.
she saved them, both of them.
she didn't have to.
she could have saved her child and let them die.
why didn't she?
because I believe that she's telling the truth about one thing.
she thinks she's in love.
even if it's software instead of an emotion, it's real to her.
she wants her baby to live.
she wants Agathon to live.
we used that.
this is not the way that I thought things were going to go down.
I knew they'd be suspicious, but...
they're human.
it's the way you are.
has anyone stopped to consider that the reason Sharon knows so much about Kobol is because it's a Cylon trap?
I've done more than consider it.
it's clearly possible we're facing a trap.
captain Apollo has already warned us that Cylon encounter in the region is probable.
has Captain Apollo managed to tell us anything we don't already know?
he is in charge of this mission.
he is second in command only to myself.
I strongly encourage you to remember that, Mr. Meier.
whatever the risks, whatever the consequences,I am going anyway.
I am committed.
captain Birch, Galactica.
you are cleared for target exercise maneuvers, acknowledge.
Galactica, leader. Wilco.
CAG to all vipers.
we're initiating our precision firing exercise as planned.
hotdog, you're first up.
Kat on deck.
leader, Hotdog. Clear to target.
executing eyeball run on three, two, one!
away!
fuck! Winged it!
come on, people, I know this is just a drill, but let's look sharp out there.
hotdog, I know you can do a lot better.
let's try it again.
see if you can put the next one in the X-ring.
cleared hot!
ready for another pass. Leader, Kat.
I'm confirming that I'm cleared for my attack run.
am I clear?
leader, Hotdog.
executing eyeball run.
affirmative, you're clear.
rolling in! Weapons hot.
leader, Kat. Did you say all clear?
I said all clear.
okay, roger that!
let's go, baby.
here we go with three, two, one!
away!
leader, beginning strafing run.
Kat, what are you doing?
you said I'm clear for my attack run!
hotdog is cleared for his attack run.
what? Hotdog?
back off, Kat! Now now now now!
Oh, my gods!
Oh! Oh, crap.
damn, bang on! Did you see that? Whoo!
bang on?
hotdog, you fucking idiot!
you almost got me killed!
what are you talking about?
birch, you said I was clear.
all Vipers, this is leader.
repeat, all Vipers, this is leader.
report back to Galactica.
report back to Galactica.
fuck!
I know how you feel.
I get it.
but I didn't shoot him. It wasn't me.
you're all the same.
you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
then maybe I'm done talking.
I think there's been enough of that today.
you are the last one who should be telling me what to do.
after the stunt you pulled?
stealing the Cylon Raider and then tearing ass back to Caprica?
yeah,'cause you're clearly the poster boy for military discipline, huh?
you know what?
you have no idea what happened to me on Caprica.
so while you're standing here polishing off your halo, consider for a second that you may not have any damned idea what the hell you're talking about.
captain.
what Roslin's doing is reckless.
we have our own fleet now.
how much longer do we need to keep playing follow the leader?
we have a fleet because people believe Roslin's going to lead them to Earth.
she's a fraud. You don't believe her, do you?
no, but I believe in the power of myth.
I'm not interested in risking our lives any more than you are, but she's clearly not gonna be talked out of this.
and in the end, President or prophet, it doesn't really matter.
she still needs a commander.
a man in charge of the fleet.
the man with the guns makes the rules.
what if she decides you're not the man to be in charge of the fleet?
what if she has someone else in mind?
someone already close to her.
like a certain captain.
let's say you're right.
that on some level...based on their belief in the scriptures, the fleet needs Laura Roslin in order to stay in line.
so we do what we must in order to keep Roslin safe on the surface of Kobol.
but...
but...
you're right.
you're absolutely right.
how could I not have seen that?
I wanna set this fleet on a path to freedom.
of course.
I wanna deliver unto them the liberty we've promised.
we are far from daylight, my friend.
the scriptures say some of us will die on Kobol.
one man in particular.
you're a little left off the center line.
striker, reset your delta to . 35, acknowledge.
how's my approach speed?
your angle vectors are too steep. Adjust.
I repeat, your angle vectors are too steep. Adjust.
what is he doing?
tell him to cut his speed.
what is it this time? I'm glad you're here.
birch is coordinating the ship for refueling.
but he's making a mess out of what should be the simplest op in the book!
how long has he been at it?
about four hours now.
sir, he's too green.
he's blowing the approach and the docking speeds.
he's missing the drogues. He's bunching the lines.
it's a mess out there.
as you know, this isn't the first screw-up.
Yes, I know.
I realize that he is your guy, but...
but he's no Apollo.
I was wondering when we'd finally get a little R & R around here.
Oh, boy.
can I have my ball back?
what, I can't hold it?
can I have my ball back, please?
Where'd you get a pyramid ball, anyway?
Caprica.
can I have my ball back, Lee?
Yeah, sure.
keep it.
Hey, come on, Kara.
for frak's sake, I'm just kidding around.
all right, here, it's all yours.
you can take your ball and go home now.
the whole thing's stupid anyway.
what's up with you, Kara? Anything you wanna talk about?
Nope.
it must have been hard, being back on Caprica.
being home.
probably saw some tough things back there.
anyway, tomorrow this whole thing is gonna end, one way or another.
we find the Tomb or we don't.
we find a way to Earth or we don't.
I just want you to know, Kara, that I'm your friend.
I love you.
if there's anything you wanna talk about, anything you wanna get off your chest, then I'm here for you.
Anyway...whenever you wanna talk, just let me know.
what was that middle part again?
hmm? What do you mean?
did you say you love me?
lee Adama loves me.
no, all I meant was
no, seriously, very sweet. You love me.
no, you love me.
you can't take it back. There's no take-backs.
you're dreaming it, Kara.
you love me. You're dreaming it.
you love me. Dreamer.
okay.
this is Striker.
I'm having trouble getting a visual on the fueling spar. Can you redirect?
gas station, Striker's coming in way too hot.
you gotta back off your delta, like right now.
didn't you hear us? Back off your delta.
you're too close! Are you listening?
okay. Abort!
abort the op.
recall the ships.
galactic to all ships involved in fuel unrep.
abort mission.
say again, abort fuel unrep.
Raptors return to base. Acknowledge.
Wilco, Galactica. Aborting mission.
damn it!
Roger that.
Galactica says abort approach.
adjusting angle vectors full reverse.
striker, you're still on a collision course.
put your helm hard left, full reverse thrusters.
back off, back off. Look out!
Galactica, Emit. Tankers intact.
no wireless contact, but it's in a lateral spin.
and there does appear to be some damage.
away rescue team.
tell them to board the tanker, restore navigational control.
here.
you never know when you might need to defend yourself.
here we go.
and the blaze pursued them.
and the people of Kobol had a choice, "to board the great ship or take the high road "through the rocky ridge
and the body of each tribe's leader "was offered to the gods in the Tomb of Athena.
Yes, precisely.
and the "great ship" was the Galleon that departed from here, where we're standing.
and it took the founders of the 13 colonies "to their destiny.
and those that didn't board the Galleon "took the high road...
the rocky ridge that led to the Tomb.
let's move.
the path is supposed to be marked by gravestones.
there's something there.
wait!
get back! Get back! Get back!
Yeah.
switch.
nice one.
ammo!
Lee, no!
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
not bad.
damn.
it's interesting.
betrayal has such a powerful grip on the mind.
it's almost like a python.
it can squeeze out all other thought.
suffocate all other emotion until everything is dead except for the rage.
I'm not talking about anger.
I'm talking about rage.
I can feel it.
right here.
like it's gonna burst.
feel like I wanna scream.
right now, matter of fact.
if I may say something?
speak your mind, Dee.
I don't think the problem is that you've been betrayed.
I think it's that you feel helpless.
you were shot, you were injured.
you couldn't do anything.
don't make excuses for me.
and when you finally had a chance to do something
sorry I did this.
you let us down.
you let us down.
you made a promise to all of us...to find Earth, to find us a home.
together.
it doesn't matter what the President did or even what Lee did, because every day that we remain apart is a day that you've broken your promise.
the people aboard those ships made their own decision.
it was their decision, not mine.
thank you, Petty Officer.
you may leave now.
you asked to talk to me, sir...
maybe because you think that I don't have anything to say.
but I do.
it's time to heal the wounds, Commander.
that'll be enough.
people have been divided.
I said, that's enough.
they're separated from their parents.
a cost in blood.
let's go, Madame President.
Mr. Gaeta.
I want to see all recon material on Kobol immediately in my quarters.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
I'm putting the fleet back together.
I'm putting our family back together.
this ends now.
deep down in that thing you call a subconscious, you know how many Cylons there are left in the fleet.
eight! There are eight!
corporal Vener reports the former President's missing.
missing? Two men down, cell's empty.
damn it.
glad to see you, Madame President.
well, Mr. Zarek, it would seem the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
go find Earth.
let's go home.
we have found Kobol.
and we retrieve the Arrow, we will open the Tomb of Athena.
and we will find the road to Earth.
no one's gonna believe this crap.
and anyone that wants to make a suicide run to Kobol, let them.
astral Queen has Jumped away.
24 ships, sir.
that's almost a third of the fleet.
they're going to follow Roslin to Kobol...
to their death.
18, 000 souls aboard the 24 ships that joined President Roslin's rebellion, sir.
that's over a third of the people in the fleet.
give me a breakdown. What have we lost?
uh, 9,500 souls from Gemenon.
6, 250 from Caprica.
not who.
what?
I'm not interested in people who decide to join up with a religious fanatic and a terrorist.
that's their business. Now, what have I lost?
12 transports, seven freighters, three construction platforms, a private cruiser, and a mining ship, sir.
monarch was a blow.
we can't afford to lose mining ships, not in our situation.
and then there's the collateral damage.
morale is down throughout the fleet.
the press is going wild.
families are being split apart.
don't talk to me about family.
I support the President completely.
and my only priorities are the preservation of her safety and the completion of this mission.
that's all well and good, but he's still Adama's son.
when push comes to shove, how do we know he'll be willing to stand
if it were not for him,I would still be in a Galactica jail cell.
I trust him completely.
and this subject is closed.
and what about Galactica?
they--they know where we are!
they could jump in here at any time and charge us all with treason or destroy this ship with a flick of the wrist.
we're not entirely defenseless!
some of our ships are armed!
we should take steps to arm the others just in case.
just in
just in case we want to commit suicide!
if Galactica wants to take us down, there is nothing we can do about it, nothing.
and nobody in this room should be under any illusions on that count.
at this point, it's my firm belief that Commander Adama has let us go.
lieutenant Thrace will return.
she will have the Arrow of Apollo.
and it will help us find our way to Earth.
and exactly how long should we wait for her?
I mean, maybe we should go down to the surface now.
go down now and start looking for this tomb.
I wouldn't be too eager.
there may still be Cylons present.
and some of us will die down there.
the scriptures tell us that any return to Kobol carries with it a cost...in blood.
people...
I realize that there are still many unanswered questions here.
Yes, it is a big one.
but it is our foretold destiny.
and I, for one...am not going to waver from it now.
if there is anyone here who does not have the stomach for this mission, you are welcome to rejoin Commander Adama's fleet.
it Jumped into dradis range about two minutes ago.
no Colonial transponder, and it's too large to be Thrace's Cylon Raider.
and no response to our hails?
not a peep, Tom.
it's either a Cylon vessel, or it's a Raptor Scout from Galactica.
either way, we should shoot first and ask questions later.
okay.
the Adriatic is in weapons range, and she's got ship-to-ship missiles.
Tom, that thing is moving fast.
if we're gonna shoot it down, we'd better shoot it down!
shoot what down?
do I have to repeat myself?
Madame President, we have a security situation.
that's all.
she wasn't talking to you.
there's an unidentified ship making its way towards us.
it's too big to be the Lieutenant's Cylon Raider.
it's in weapons range.
the Adriatic has to fire her missiles now.
we need a decision, Madame President.
civilian vessels, civilian vessels.
this is Starbuck. Do you read?
do you read?
say again, this is Starbuck.
is anybody getting this?
initiate docking.
good to see you too, Captain.
remind me to send you to the brig later.
Yeah, well...
lieutenant.
Lee, there's something I need to tell you.
Lee, wait!
don't you frakking move!
stop! She's with us!
drop your weapon, sir.
drop your weapon.
gentlemen, I'm only going to say this once.
captain Adama, and--what is your name?
lieutenant Agathon.
used to be Sharon's ECO.
I thought you were dead, Helo.
you a Cylon, too?
don't even.
all right, here's what we're going to do.
you're going to lower your weapons.
am I being perfectly clear?
what about Sharon?
she will be taken to a holding cell where she will remain unharmed.
okay. How about it, Apollo?
should we do what the nice lady says?
she's the President of the Colonies, you moron.
and yes, we're gonna do exactly what she says.
lower your weapons.
now.
thank you.
now put that thing out the airlock.
what?
we don't keep Cylons around here, Lieutenant.
what the fuck?
you said you weren't gonna hurt her!
Hey, Helo! Listen to me!
one of those things put two rounds into my father's chest.
it wasn't me! Adama was shot?
Yes.
you missed a few catastrophes while you were away.
please tell me he's alive.
after two emergency surgeries,
Cottle managed to save him.
it wasn't me!
Kara! For the love of gods!
Sharon--this Sharon saved our lives back on Caprica. Tell them!
tell them!
I know how to find the Tomb of Athena!
do you?
Kobol's a big planet!
you don't find the Tomb, you don't find Earth!
listen to her, for gods' sakes!
listen to me!
Madame President.
tell them to wait a minute.
thank you.
Mr. Zarek, is there some place where that...young woman and I can speak?
I can arrange that.
it's great to see you again, Kara.
thanks for bringing in the trash.
looks like we missed all the fun.
no.
mueller's not a bad choice.
he did a tour as a squadron XO
mueller's a malcontent.
I know you don't want to hear this, but there is not another Apollo in this bunch.
and we do have to pick a new CAG.
commander Adama.
lieutenant Birch, please come in.
thank you for coming on such short notice.
of course, sir.
I'm sure you're aware there's been a change in the fleet.
several of our pilots departed.
I was just thinking that we need a new CAG to step up.
absolutely, sir.
who's it going to be?
congratulations, Captain.
it's you.
thank you, sir.
just want you to know you have total support of myself and this entire crew.
is that not right, Colonel?
Absolutely. Get your log book.
Congratulations.
I'm honored, Commander.
I won't let you down.
and, sir, I'd just like to say that I was a tremendous supporter of your son, Captain Adama.
he was--he was a great leader, sir.
a ship is a family.
it works on trust, understanding, and love.
I love everyone on this ship as much as I love my son.
Galactica is still a family.
you're an important part of that family.
do you understand?
Yes, sir.
thank you, George.
I'm sure you'll do a fine job.
what the hell?
you got me in here jawing about picking a new CAG, and you've already made your choice.
I just wanted to see if you and I were on the same page or not.
I beg your pardon? I guess we're not.
you guessed right.
you're telling me that kid is leadership material?
we have very few choices.
he's the best. He's a good man, Saul.
he's honest and he's loyal.
we need a little bit of that around here right now.
well, it's your call. I'll support it.
commander, will you be commenting today regarding the split of the fleet?
commander, will you be answering questions regarding the split of the fleet?
can you make any comments regarding Laura Roslin and how you feel about the split?
does this thing work?
please be seated.
allow me to make a statement, please.
please allow me to make a statement.
please be seated.
thank you very much.
if you don't already know, the fleet has been divided.
please!
we share the grief of friends lost.
and the resources we've sacrificed will present new challenges for all of us.
but if we stay together, we will rise to the occasion as we have before.
And?
questions.
Yes.
uh, you know the coordinates, the whereabouts of President Roslin's rebellion.
do you intend to put the fleet back together?
first of all, Laura Roslin is no longer President.
she relinquished that role when she suborned mutiny aboard this ship.
next question.
but--but Commander!
commander! Commander!
Yes, go ahead.
since the fleet has been divided
commander, you haven't answered my question yet.
we have lost no one that cannot be replaced by someone loyal...who has chosen to remain with us.
this is the fleet.
thank you.
commander! Commander!
commander, is there any truth to the rumor that there is no Earth, it doesn't exist, and you just made it up?
what the hell kind of question is that?
it's been all over talk wireless, newsletter circuit, hand mail.
freedom of the press is not a license to slander.
broadcasting that kind of garbage is the quickest way to find yourself in a holding cell.
and that goes for all of you. -We're done here.
are you a dictator?
what happened to free speech, Commander?
get your hands off of me.
why don't you calm down?
remind me not to do that again.
always looked easy enough when Roslin did it.
there was an old footbridge...over the Euclid River.
I used to go there when I was a boy.
watch the fish try and swim upstream.
they were mesmerizing.
I envied them.
unaware as they were of the...wider complexities and challenges of life.
you're beginning to see human beings as we see them.
what I am beginning to see are Cylon faces.
everywhere I look.
Sharon told me there were eight Cylons left in the fleet.
why didn't I ask her who they were?
if that idiot hadn't have shot her...
and why is it when things go wrong, they go wrong so well?
Gaius, you get yourself far, far too worked up about these things.
they do have it easy, don't they?
they?
why are you talking to me like I'm not one of them?
in some ways you never were.
you have a path, you will be spared their fate.
for once, Gaius, you can stop manipulating the world and let destiny take its course.
if there's one thing we know about human beings with certainty...
they are masters of self destruction.
because I love him.
and because I'm carrying his child.
Oh, I see. That explains it.
you're not here because you mean us any harm or because you're a programmed enemy of humanity.
you're here because you had an affair with one of our Raptor pilots. Listen to me.
I'm listening to you. That's my mistake.
I'm listening to a Cylon.
I am here because I chose to come here.
and I know you don't believe me.
but hear this...
even if you find the Tomb, even if you find the map, and even if you find Earth, the price you pay will be too high.
I'm not interested in your prophecies.
I know that there is a Cylon force on Kobol.
I know it's dangerous.
and I have little doubt that you are communicating everything I say even as we speak.
it doesn't work like that! I'm not wired in!
Sharon, it's simple.
what I need to know, and what might keep you alive is exactly how to find the Tomb of Athena.
get me a map, and I will do my best to tell you how to get to the Tomb.
no, you'll do better than your best.
I want to know where it is.
and you either know or you don't.
we all know about the Tomb.
I can show you the path.
I don't know how long the path is or exactly where it leads to, but I can tell you...
she claims to love Lieutenant Agathon.
she says she loves the baby she's carrying.
who cares what she says?
you can't believe a word any of them
the Scrolls of Pythia do speak of a lower demon who helped the people in a time of crisis.
more superstition.
I've told her that unless we return from Kobol with a map to Earth that Lieutenant Agathon will be put out the airlock as a Cylon conspirator.
is that true?
doesn't matter if it's true, she believed it.
she saved them, both of them.
she didn't have to.
she could have saved her child and let them die.
why didn't she?
because I believe that she's telling the truth about one thing.
she thinks she's in love.
even if it's software instead of an emotion, it's real to her.
she wants her baby to live.
she wants Agathon to live.
we used that.
this is not the way that I thought things were going to go down.
I knew they'd be suspicious, but...
they're human.
it's the way you are.
has anyone stopped to consider that the reason Sharon knows so much about Kobol is because it's a Cylon trap?
I've done more than consider it.
it's clearly possible we're facing a trap.
captain Apollo has already warned us that Cylon encounter in the region is probable.
has Captain Apollo managed to tell us anything we don't already know?
he is in charge of this mission.
he is second in command only to myself.
I strongly encourage you to remember that, Mr. Meier.
whatever the risks, whatever the consequences,I am going anyway.
I am committed.
captain Birch, Galactica.
you are cleared for target exercise maneuvers, acknowledge.
Galactica, leader. Wilco.
CAG to all vipers.
we're initiating our precision firing exercise as planned.
hotdog, you're first up.
Kat on deck.
leader, Hotdog. Clear to target.
executing eyeball run on three, two, one!
away!
fuck! Winged it!
come on, people, I know this is just a drill, but let's look sharp out there.
hotdog, I know you can do a lot better.
let's try it again.
see if you can put the next one in the X-ring.
cleared hot!
ready for another pass. Leader, Kat.
I'm confirming that I'm cleared for my attack run.
am I clear?
leader, Hotdog.
executing eyeball run.
affirmative, you're clear.
rolling in! Weapons hot.
leader, Kat. Did you say all clear?
I said all clear.
okay, roger that!
let's go, baby.
here we go with three, two, one!
away!
leader, beginning strafing run.
Kat, what are you doing?
you said I'm clear for my attack run!
hotdog is cleared for his attack run.
what? Hotdog?
back off, Kat! Now now now now!
Oh, my gods!
Oh! Oh, crap.
damn, bang on! Did you see that? Whoo!
bang on?
hotdog, you fucking idiot!
you almost got me killed!
what are you talking about?
birch, you said I was clear.
all Vipers, this is leader.
repeat, all Vipers, this is leader.
report back to Galactica.
report back to Galactica.
fuck!
I know how you feel.
I get it.
but I didn't shoot him. It wasn't me.
you're all the same.
you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
then maybe I'm done talking.
I think there's been enough of that today.
you are the last one who should be telling me what to do.
after the stunt you pulled?
stealing the Cylon Raider and then tearing ass back to Caprica?
yeah,'cause you're clearly the poster boy for military discipline, huh?
you know what?
you have no idea what happened to me on Caprica.
so while you're standing here polishing off your halo, consider for a second that you may not have any damned idea what the hell you're talking about.
captain.
what Roslin's doing is reckless.
we have our own fleet now.
how much longer do we need to keep playing follow the leader?
we have a fleet because people believe Roslin's going to lead them to Earth.
she's a fraud. You don't believe her, do you?
no, but I believe in the power of myth.
I'm not interested in risking our lives any more than you are, but she's clearly not gonna be talked out of this.
and in the end, President or prophet, it doesn't really matter.
she still needs a commander.
a man in charge of the fleet.
the man with the guns makes the rules.
what if she decides you're not the man to be in charge of the fleet?
what if she has someone else in mind?
someone already close to her.
like a certain captain.
let's say you're right.
that on some level...based on their belief in the scriptures, the fleet needs Laura Roslin in order to stay in line.
so we do what we must in order to keep Roslin safe on the surface of Kobol.
but...
but...
you're right.
you're absolutely right.
how could I not have seen that?
I wanna set this fleet on a path to freedom.
of course.
I wanna deliver unto them the liberty we've promised.
we are far from daylight, my friend.
the scriptures say some of us will die on Kobol.
one man in particular.
you're a little left off the center line.
striker, reset your delta to . 35, acknowledge.
how's my approach speed?
your angle vectors are too steep. Adjust.
I repeat, your angle vectors are too steep. Adjust.
what is he doing?
tell him to cut his speed.
what is it this time? I'm glad you're here.
birch is coordinating the ship for refueling.
but he's making a mess out of what should be the simplest op in the book!
how long has he been at it?
about four hours now.
sir, he's too green.
he's blowing the approach and the docking speeds.
he's missing the drogues. He's bunching the lines.
it's a mess out there.
as you know, this isn't the first screw-up.
Yes, I know.
I realize that he is your guy, but...
but he's no Apollo.
I was wondering when we'd finally get a little R & R around here.
Oh, boy.
can I have my ball back?
what, I can't hold it?
can I have my ball back, please?
Where'd you get a pyramid ball, anyway?
Caprica.
can I have my ball back, Lee?
Yeah, sure.
keep it.
Hey, come on, Kara.
for frak's sake, I'm just kidding around.
all right, here, it's all yours.
you can take your ball and go home now.
the whole thing's stupid anyway.
what's up with you, Kara? Anything you wanna talk about?
Nope.
it must have been hard, being back on Caprica.
being home.
probably saw some tough things back there.
anyway, tomorrow this whole thing is gonna end, one way or another.
we find the Tomb or we don't.
we find a way to Earth or we don't.
I just want you to know, Kara, that I'm your friend.
I love you.
if there's anything you wanna talk about, anything you wanna get off your chest, then I'm here for you.
Anyway...whenever you wanna talk, just let me know.
what was that middle part again?
hmm? What do you mean?
did you say you love me?
lee Adama loves me.
no, all I meant was
no, seriously, very sweet. You love me.
no, you love me.
you can't take it back. There's no take-backs.
you're dreaming it, Kara.
you love me. You're dreaming it.
you love me. Dreamer.
okay.
this is Striker.
I'm having trouble getting a visual on the fueling spar. Can you redirect?
gas station, Striker's coming in way too hot.
you gotta back off your delta, like right now.
didn't you hear us? Back off your delta.
you're too close! Are you listening?
okay. Abort!
abort the op.
recall the ships.
galactic to all ships involved in fuel unrep.
abort mission.
say again, abort fuel unrep.
Raptors return to base. Acknowledge.
Wilco, Galactica. Aborting mission.
damn it!
Roger that.
Galactica says abort approach.
adjusting angle vectors full reverse.
striker, you're still on a collision course.
put your helm hard left, full reverse thrusters.
back off, back off. Look out!
Galactica, Emit. Tankers intact.
no wireless contact, but it's in a lateral spin.
and there does appear to be some damage.
away rescue team.
tell them to board the tanker, restore navigational control.
here.
you never know when you might need to defend yourself.
here we go.
and the blaze pursued them.
and the people of Kobol had a choice, "to board the great ship or take the high road "through the rocky ridge
and the body of each tribe's leader "was offered to the gods in the Tomb of Athena.
Yes, precisely.
and the "great ship" was the Galleon that departed from here, where we're standing.
and it took the founders of the 13 colonies "to their destiny.
and those that didn't board the Galleon "took the high road...
the rocky ridge that led to the Tomb.
let's move.
the path is supposed to be marked by gravestones.
there's something there.
wait!
get back! Get back! Get back!
Yeah.
switch.
nice one.
ammo!
Lee, no!
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
not bad.
damn.
it's interesting.
betrayal has such a powerful grip on the mind.
it's almost like a python.
it can squeeze out all other thought.
suffocate all other emotion until everything is dead except for the rage.
I'm not talking about anger.
I'm talking about rage.
I can feel it.
right here.
like it's gonna burst.
feel like I wanna scream.
right now, matter of fact.
if I may say something?
speak your mind, Dee.
I don't think the problem is that you've been betrayed.
I think it's that you feel helpless.
you were shot, you were injured.
you couldn't do anything.
don't make excuses for me.
and when you finally had a chance to do something
sorry I did this.
you let us down.
you let us down.
you made a promise to all of us...to find Earth, to find us a home.
together.
it doesn't matter what the President did or even what Lee did, because every day that we remain apart is a day that you've broken your promise.
the people aboard those ships made their own decision.
it was their decision, not mine.
thank you, Petty Officer.
you may leave now.
you asked to talk to me, sir...
maybe because you think that I don't have anything to say.
but I do.
it's time to heal the wounds, Commander.
that'll be enough.
people have been divided.
I said, that's enough.
they're separated from their parents.
a cost in blood.
let's go, Madame President.
Mr. Gaeta.
I want to see all recon material on Kobol immediately in my quarters.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
I'm putting the fleet back together.
I'm putting our family back together.
this ends now.
the Cylons were created by man
they rebelled
they evolved
they are many copies
I, sharon agathon, will carry out the lawful ordersof my superiors as an officerin the colonial fleet.
congratulations, lieutenant.
we're talking about peopleblowing themselves up.
I got one job here, lady, and one job only-- to destruct the cylons.
make them worry about the anthill they've stirred updown here, so they're distractedand out of position when the old man shows upin orbit.
you know the mission.
you should also knowthere's only one way that this mission ends.
and that's with the successful rescue of our people off of new caprica.
evacuate the entire facility.
you should goas well, gaius.
there's a place for you too.
Hi. Who's this?
this is -kacey.
Oh, my little girl.
when the cylons took her, I thought-- but you saved her.
gods bless you.
a lot of good peoplehad to pay the price for what they did.
choices they madeon new caprica.
like my wife.
that's right, ellen collaborated.
gave the cylons information on the resistance, and she died for it.
I can't believe there's stilla question of my value.
there will always bea question.
you're human.
good to see you.
I far prefer thesepicturesque settings for our interludes.
don't you?
I thought you had abandoned meto your cylon comrades.
would I do that?
you've always beenmore unpredictable than your flesh and bloodcounterparts.
a man that loves women as much as you should have learned that a long time ago.
I'm a slow learner.
then take this periodas a time to learn all you canabout the cylons.
you'll need itin the days ahead.
something specialon the horizon?
Cylon psychologyis based on projection. -Projection?
it's how they choose to seethe world around them.
the only difference isyou choose to see me.
what are you...
Really?
you're either connected tothe woman I knew in caprica...
or you're just a damaged partof my subconscious struggling for self-expression.
so which one is it?
I'm an angel of god, sent here to help you.
just as I alwayshave been.
we're all part ofone big ecosystem.
Yes, I can feel it...
breathing. - get used to it
so, what'd he say?
I haven't asked him yet.
asked me about what?
earth.
What--uh...
earth. It's the 13th colony.
do you know howto find it?
not really, no.
well, that's unfortunate.
there was a hope--my hope-- that if you knewthe way to earth, it would justify keeping you alive a little longer.
come on, six.
wait. Wait, wait!
now when I say that I do not knowexactly where earth is, that is not to say that I do not know a very great deal aboutits probably location.
honestly, I spent hours, days, weeks, monthsand months on a map that adamaand roslin found on kobol.
and I correlated thatwith astrometric observations.
I doubt anyone herecan make the same claim.
we'll get back to you.
what do you careabout finding earth?
because we'relooking for it.
you are?
Yes, we've decidedthat earth's going to be our new home.
ship-to-ship training exercise is authorized.
you may commencewhen ready.

severed the fuel line. Cally, check the tank.
gods.
the tank's bone dry There's not even fumesin here.
captain, how'd you land this thing?
pointed it toward the deck, and stopped when I got here.
bone dry, she says.
landed the bird withouta drop of fuel.
if you want to die, I will open upan airlock for you.
but you are not taking one of my vipers with you.
the bird's on the deck.
I'm on the deck.
I don't know whatyou're bitching about.
I don't give a frakwhat you so, starbuck, you're done flying.
XXXXXXXXX what?
don't look at me like that.
Oh, my gods.
Ellen?
Ellen?
excuse me.
Hey, make a hole.
Ellen.
if I've told you once, I've told you 1, 000 times-- ellen, I'm right here.
what is this? Let go of me.
Kara, kara!
kacey?
Kara, kara.
captain thrace?
I'm sorry, don't youremember me?
I'm julia prynne. I'm kacey's mom.
Yeah. Yeah, I remember.
give me a hug.
we've been stayingover in the-- well, everyone's calling itcamp oil slick.
part of the hangar deck.
and they've put up cotsfor, you know, refugees.
Yeah, I heard.
well, kacey's been askingto see you for days.
I sent messages.
I thought maybe you'dcome for a visit.
you seem likea really nice person so I'm gonna be honestwith you.
the last thing I needis a two-year-old friend.
and kacey sure as helldoes not need me in her life, so do us both a favor, and do not bring heraround here again, okay?
go to your mom, kase.
sure.
sorry, don't let uskeep you up.
sorry, honey, we gotta go.
there is goes.
that's it.
see?
see, I told youyou could do it.
you did great.
remind me never tolet that happen again.
xxxxx
ever.
I've been tryingto reassemble president bal
Dr. Baltar's workon piecing together the 13th tribe's pathto earth.
I'm curious, mr. Gaeta.
what is it thatyou trust about dr. Baltar'sresearch?
how do you know it's notanother one of his lies?
if there was one thingI learned about baltar it was hisextraordinary capacity for self-preservation.
I think he wantedto find earth because he wanted to get there.
how far did he getwith his research?
well, as you can see, I'm still hackingthrough his notes.
but it appears thathe was trying to correlate our ownastrometric readings with the mapof constellations that we foundback on kobol and apply his findings to certain selectpassages within the scrollof pythia.
why the scroll of pythia?
Pythia is supposed to have chronicled the original journeyof the 13th tribe on its way to earth.
if I can craw your attentionto this passage.
and the caravanof the heavens "was watched overby a great lion "with a mightyblinking eye, red and blue.
exactly.
exactly what?
you're looking fora lion's head?
with a mightyblinking eye.
blinking well, they're scrolls.
they speak in metaphors.
initially, I thought the doctor might be off his medsas well, sir.
but then I foundthis note here, where he had written"blinking equals pulsar.
that means a star, right?
uh, plural, actually.
they're the rotating coresof dead stars.
the emit a blastof radio waves.
from a distance, they appear to
blink. -Right.
the doctor found twoin very close mutual orbit within this sector.
the spectrographic readingsthat I found show one will appearto be red, and one will appearto be blue.
these pulsars appear to bein this nebula.
we have never had a direct lookat this area.
but it is possible, with a couple of eyeballsout there, they might lookat the nebula and see
a giant lion's head.
well, it looks likethis is the best thing we've got going, so, unless you object, admiral, I suggest we golion hunting.
the navigational markersyou gave us may prove useful.
they sent a base ship outto investigate the pulsars, and look for thislion's head of yours.
look, this isn't easyfor me.
I don't thinkyou fully appreciate just how difficultthis is.
I have very conflicted, very ambiguous feelings about helping youfind earth.
funny how allthat ambivalence and conflictseemed to vanish once you thought your lifehung in the balance.
you should know there'sstill a lot of skepticism about whether you're beingentirely truthful.
I'm very sorry.
we didn't meanto intrude.
come on, gaius.
are we going 'roundin circles?
I'm sure it alllooks the same to you, doesn't it?
be hard for any humanto navigate around here.
especially withoutprojecting.
Yes, you've usedthat word before.
I'm not quite surewhat you're talking about.
it helps you to what, exactly?
have you everdaydreamed...
and imagined thatyou were somewhere else?
I do have an activeimagination.
well, we don't haveto imagine.
we project.
we choose to seeour environment in any form we wish, whenever we wish.
for instance, right nowyou see us as standingin a hallway, but I see itas a forest.
filled with trees, birds, sunlight.
like the walks thatyou and I used to take.
on caprica.
the aesthetic is whatgives me pleasure.
not the specificmemories.
instead of staringat blank walls, I choose to surround myself with a visionof god's creation.
now I understandprojection, but isn't ita coincidence that I could see sucha vivid reality that I've created, and the cylonprojection experience seems to be so similar?
is it a coincidence?
well, what are you saying?
there's a connection?
what, because ofmy experiences with you
am I a cylon?
what was that?
Oh, nothing. Just talking out loud.
silly me.
so you sure you want to go in the second seat again?
I mean, I hear you'rea pretty fair pilot now.
well, too many pilots, not enough birds.
anything to keep me flying, at this point.
you want me, I'm yours, boomer.
uh, no, boomer was-- she was someone else.
listen up.
we need a new call sign for lieutenant agathon.
chrome dome.
Titanian
wind-up toy...Tin can...
toaster babe.
how 'bout athena?
wait, wait, wait, wait.
what was that?
you know, the goddessof wisdom and war.
usually accompanied by the goddess of victory.
Athena it is.
Hey, colonel!
Colonel, come have a seat.
over here.
enough of thatto go around?
always. -Oh, yeah.
dead man's chest--cut-throat game.
not usually your style.
it is now.
and I'm in itto win.
you don't like it, find another game.
Oh, there's some straight talk.
have you seen the lineupoutside the head?
15 civiliansstanding in line picking their noses and waitingto take a shower.
Frakin' civilians thinkthey run the ship now.
beats what we had before. The ship was like a tomb.
you want to knowwhat alone feels like try spending a few weeksin a cylon holding cell.
Yeah, it was a bitchon both sides.
and it wasn't exactly easycoming up with a plan to save your sorry butts.
you guys had it rough, huh?
hot showers, three squares a day.
viper jocks didn't even take a shot till you jumped into orbit.
hey...
we all made sacrifices.
is that so?
Yes, that's right.
while you werepinning wings on your cylongirlfriend, and our people werestrapping homemade bombs to their chests, doing whatever they couldto take the bastards out.
so forgive me if I don'tget all misty over your sacrifices.
you seem distracted, gaius.
do I?
you can rest easy, at least for now.
the data onearth's location in your valiant rescueof the baby has gone a long waytoward impressing the others.
I used to think you and iwould have a baby one day.
there are only 12cylon models.
but in the entire occupationon new caprica, I only saw seven.
now here again, the same seven.
who are the final five?
I can't talk about that -Can't or won't?
I can'T.
it's complicated, butwe don't talk about them.
ever.
but you'd know one of them, wouldn't you, if you saw them?
one of the final five. If they were to walkpast here right
six, we havea problem.
a bay ship.
the one we sentto investigate the pulsars in the lion nebula.
we've lost contact.
the trouble is we knowalmost nothing about the missingbay ship's status.
we received a garbleddistress call, then silence.
not surprisingly, their hybrid sent us a confusing set of data.
our hybridis analyzing it.
what are these hybridshe's talking about?
be quiet, gaius.
our hybrid's decipheredpart of the data set that we receivedfrom our scout ship.
this can't happen to us. It's impossible.
it is not only possible, it may have been inevitable once we took human form.
we're not human.
we're not like him.
God has chosen this time, this place, to test us.
whether we fail or pass the test is up to us.
what's going on?
the missing baseship, it's been infected bysome kind of disease.
disease? -yes, it's killing them.
all of them.
if an infected cylon dies, and carries this disease with them into a resurrection ship, it could rapidly spread. Potentially infectingour entire race.
all right, we make surethat the resurrection ship is out of range.
then we jumpto their location.
send in a groupof centurions
no. The data set indicates that as soon as the hybridwas infected, the centurions startedshutting down.
we don't know how oursare gonna be affected.
I assume our raiders and baseships are also susceptible.
of course.
we are all created fromthe same genetic pool.
then no cylon canboard that ship without riskinginfection.
say you'll go aboardthe infected baseship, and investigatewhat happened.
you sent them to that nebula. Remember?
are you mad?
you have to prove to themyou can be counted on in an emergency.
show them you're worthkeeping alive.
and what if I catchthe disease?
what are the chancesthat a human could catch somethingthat infects a centurion or a raider?
that is, if you're human.
and if you're really a cylon
one of the final fiveyou haven't seen yet
wouldn't you ratherjust get it over with and die?
okay.
what?
Yes, I'll go.
look, I am a trained scientist.
I can go to the baseship.
I can make observationsabout the cylons.
their physical condition.
bring back informationabout this disease, which now threatensall of you.
we've learned the diseasethat's killing the human cylons could infect oneof our raiders as well.
then don't send a raider.
surely the war's furbished you xxxx he's right. We could programone of our raptors to approach on autopilot.
all right, then prepareto jump the ship.
make sure theresurrection xxxxx a truly selfless act.
I could usea refill here.
here's to knowing...
that somebody will alwayshave your back.
the sentiment's right, but in my book, trust is an overratedcommodity.
Mmm, that oneI'll drink to.
frak you guys.
what is your problem, katraine?
my problem is you, captain.
and all thisus against them crap.
truth hurts, doesn't it? Gimme another one.
you know what, starbuck?
whatever happened to youdown there why don't you take it outon the cylons, 'cause we busted our assto get you off that rock.
do you thinkthat means anything?
every colonist that landedon new caprica was loyal, to a point.
it was amazingwatching those people that you thought you knewgo over to the cylons.
at least in the end, we knew where we stood, huh?
is that so?
then how come you areoff flight duty and some cylon loveris holding down my post?
don't kid yourselves.
you're on your own in this life.
each and every one of us.
why don't you tell thatto the pilots that died getting you off that rock?
and gaeta's briefingsharon and racetrack on the scouting missionto the pulsars.
you mean athenaand racetrack.
word travels fast.
Yes, it does.
I understand that morale'staken a hit on the flight deck.
nothing we can't handle, sir.
I'm also toldthat colonel tigh is spending a lot of timedown in the pilots' rec room.
both himand starbuck, sir.
they've been holding court.
second-guessing the rescue, bad-mouthing the crew that stayed up with galactica.
suddenly, if you weren'tin the ground war, it's like you can'tbe trusted.
people are listening.
your word carries a lot of weight.
you're right, they're destroying morale and unit cohesion.
they both know better.
I don't thinkthey care, sir.
two protons expelled at each coupling site creates the mode of force.
the embryo becomes a fish that we don't enter until a plate.
we're here to experience, evolve the little toe.
atrophy. Don't ask me how.
I'll be dead in1, 000 light years.
thank you.
genesis turnsto its source.
reduction occurs step-wise, though the essence is all one.
end of line.
after your system check, diagnostic functions within parameters, repeats the harlequin.
the agony exquisite, the colors run the path of ashes.
is it aware of us?
of course.
she's aware of everything aboard.
new paragraph.
do you have any ideawhat it's talking about?
no.
most cylons think the conscious mind of the hybrid has simply gone mad, and the vocalizations we hear are meaningless.
but not everyonethinks that.
the ones you knowas leoben believe that every wordout of her mouth means something.
that god literallyspeaks to us through her.
she sort of controlsthe baseship, does she?
she is the baseship, in a very real sense.
mind gone mad.
she experiences life very differently than we do, gaius.
she swims in the heavens...
laughs at stars, breathes in cosmic dust.
maybe leoben's right.
maybe she does see god.
we're wasting time.
jump
there are bodieseverywhere.
they're dying.
xxxxx
definitely man-made.
you're severelydehydrated.
you must drinksome water.
kill me.
you don't understand. There is no resurrection shipnearby.
you will not be downloadedinto a new body.
you will just be gone.
I saw how they died.
please-- please, I can't bear that.
I'm hereto bring help. All right?
I'm just gonna takesome blood samples for analysison the baseship.
and then we will be able to makea treatment for the disease.
just breathe, please.
please take some water.
you're-- you're from galactica.
no, I'm from a baseship.
tell me...
do you knowwhat this is?
we found it floatingat these coordinates.
must be some kindof...
beacon...
or marker -It looks too old.
it looks very old.
must've been leftby the 13th tribe.
it was infected, poisoned.
left by some humans like youto destroy us. -What?
a human devicefilled with a pestilence.
you sent usto this place.
it wasn't me. -You know we'd bring it aboard.
you don't knowwhat you're saying.
this is the diseasespeaking through you. Calm down.
I am going to bring help.
I would never do anythingto hurt you.
you and the other baseshipsknew it was here. -I am going to bring help.
be quiet. Be quiet.
I'm going to bring help. -You want to destroy us all.
it's your fault!
you lie to them. -Shut up!
you lie to them. -Shut up!
be quiet! Be quiet! Shut up!
be quiet! Shut up! -You're gonnainfect all of us!
shut up!
Gaius, do you hear us?
Gaius, do you read? Is anyone alive?
speak to us.
what do you see?
are any of them alive?
this is gaius baltar.
I'm returningto the baseship. -What do you see?
I see nothing.
nothing of consequence.
there's nothing leftto do here.
nobody likes it, but we have to make a terrible choice
do we attempt a rescue, and risk the livesof our fleet-- even our species, or do we leave them?
the answer won'tbe found in science because there'sno cure in science.
well, there has to be. Do we just leave them? Then they're condemnedto death they must be sacrificed for the greater good.
there is a greater question.
Yes, there is.
how did this happen?
it's baltar, of course.
it's his fault. He led us there deliberately.
he's been working with galactica the whole time.
it wasn't me.
whatever you think I did, I didn't do, honestly!
Baltar, we followedyour coordinates and found a diseasewith no treatment or cure.
clearly they're doomed.
never to return.
perhaps god wouldsmile upon us for our mercy.
Oh, listen to you. You can barely evenspeak his name.
we have to leave them.
we have to jump, andleave them to their fate.
there is no other way.
mists of dreams drip alongthe nascent echo, and love no more.
end of line.
the hybrid objects.
she doesn't geta vote.
jump the ship.
jump.
this disease...
it must've comefrom someplace.
so what did you notice on the infected ship?
nothing. Nothing.
I am just as baffled as you are.
you noticed nothing suspiciouson the infected ship?
nothing whatsoever.
Admiral on deck.
Admiral.
give me the room.
stay in your seat.
have a drink?
give me your sidearm.
what?
your sidearm.
Hey, there's a live roundin that.
now one of you, and I don't care who, pick that weapon upand shoot me.
Admiral, I don't know -I didn't say to talk.
you've done enoughof that already.
I said to pick upthat weapon, and shoot.
what's the matter?
no guts?
you don't got a pair?
you're bothfrakking cowards.
watch your mouth. -Or what?
you going to turnthe rest of my pilots against each other?
poison the crew?
you've already done that, saul.
both of you.
Yeah, well, if you'relooking for an apology, it isn't gonna happen.
you were like a daughterto me once. No more.
you're malcontented, and a cancer.
and I won't have youon my ship.
so you have a choice.
you figure out how tobecome a human being again, and an officer, or you can findanother place to live.
off of this ship.
you're dismissed.
are you gonna kick meout of my chair too?
listen, I know you'vebeen through a lot. -Don't patronize me.
say what you came hereto say.
you're full of bile, hatred.
and I know that it has something to do with ellen.
and I'm sorry for that.
and if you need time, saul, well, you take all the time you want.
but I gotta run a ship.
the last thing I needis a one-eyed drunk sitting down here sowing discontent, disobedience.
so I'll tell youonce again, saul.
you can pick up that weaponand kill me...
or you can get your assback into your quarters, and not leave...
until you're ready to actlike the man that I've known for the past 30 years.
that man doesn't existanymore, bill.
and you won't beseeing me again.
Oh, my gods, it's right there.
the lion's head nebula, and the blinking eye.
holy crap, it'sthe road to earth.
Oh, my gods.
let's get the frakout of here.
I'll start the jump.
when god's anger awakens, even the mightyshall fall.
frak, athena, we needto get out of here!
tonight on Baywatch:
meantime, it's a magnet for every macho surfer trying to shoot the pier.
I'm back!
Hey, how you doing, Hobie, huh?
how you doing, Uncle Buzzy?
Hey, Hobie. Meet your cousin.
he's my son.
San Dimas Pier.
met some dude, said they were the hairiest break around.
you can't surf there, it's too dangerous.
you're a real hero, huh, Mitch? What if he dies?
what happens if he lives?
can you handle that, Buzz?
the Fabulous Buchannon Boys
Mitch, this is so nice of you, but I really feel guilty about taking the afternoon off.
guilt feelings... I like that.
Hey.
I've been busting my butt trying to get this paper going.
you know, I just want The Venice Voice to stand for something.
I want it to have an impact.
and I want to address the issues that affect our community.
a laptop computer.
I borrowed it from the office.
what for?
your lead story.
my lead story? - There it is.
the San Dimas Pier.
what about it? It's condemned.
I thought they were going to tear it down.
that's just it...they're not tearing it down until they figure out who's going to pay for it.
the owners have filed a lawsuit, but between the county, the state, the owners and the attorneys, the whole thing could be tied up in court for years.
meantime, it's a magnet for every macho surfer trying to shoot the pier.
see that black stuff around the pilings?
Yeah.
it's called rebar.
cut you up real good.
why don't you just close down the beach in this area?
it's a good idea, but we don't have the manpower to patrol the area 24 hours a day.
I don't know, Mitch. To be perfectly honest with you,
I don't think there's a story here.
I mean, nobody cares about a collapsing pier.
Hey!
what's wrong?
is he all right?
Yeah, he's cut.
I don't think it's too bad, though.
easy, easy, easy. - There you go.
okay.
do me a favor. - All right.
put some pressure right here. - Uh-huh.
this easy.
Thanks. I'll be right back.
next time, read the signs, huh, buddy.
it's going to be okay.
it's going to be all right.
all I know is that sooner or later, somebody's gonna get seriously mangled on the pilings.
Mitch, I understand your concerns. I feel exactly the same way.
I put in a call to the county commissioner.
what did he say? - He's not in.
big surprise.
look, Mitch, I know there's been some foot-dragging on this, but we still have to work through the proper channels on these matters.
not anymore...
Kay Morgan's gonna run a front page story in "The Venice Voice."
you think it's wise to get the media involved now?
nobody's listening to us, Captain.
maybe she'll get their attention.
what is it with these surfers today, Mitch?
I mean, we never had to prove anything.
running a gauntlet of some battered pilings?
I mean, it was enough just being out there, getting on top of a wave, feeling the power of the world under your board.
hanging ten. - Hanging ten.
walking the nose. - Walking the nose.
would you two follow me?
I've got something to show you.
Ah, this was my first surfboard, gentlemen.
a Mickey Dora original, complete with a hatchet skeg.
this old plank and I go back a long way.
longer than either one of us care to remember, eh, Ben.
Yeah.
you know, I'll never forget my first stick.
it was a hand-me-down from my brother, Buzz.
boy, could that baby rip.
you know, I offered it to Hobie, but he said he wouldn't be caught dead with an antique.
so I had to go out and buy him one of those new jobs, you know, the tri-fins with the gorilla grips.
that damn thing cost me a week's salary.
Yeah, tell me about it, huh.
at least the waves are still free, Mitch.
Yeah, well, so far.
see, feel the material.
the finest quality.
imported directly from Brazil.
the bargain of a lifetime, $25, two for $40.
what's the special of the day?
bikinis.
made from a new, organic material.
one size fits all.
please, you will look even more beautiful...
if that is possible.
I have enough bikinis, Eduardo. Thank you.
so, you got a permit? - A permit? Of course.
I'm a business man.
naturally, I would have a permit. One second please.
it seems I left this permit in my car.
well, where is your car?
unfortunately, my wife drove it to the doctor's.
she's very ill.
I have to sell these bikinis to buy her medicine.
all right, that's enough, Eduardo.
we're gonna let it slide this last time.
but that's it. Comprende? - Absolutely.
I am a law-abiding citizen.
I love this country. I will do whatever you say.
look, see, feel the material.
the finest quality.
imported directly from Brazil.
Hey.
what's the story here?
I thought you were supposed to clean your room before we left?
I did. - You did?
where?
all right, just do me a favor?
make your bed, and I'll help you with all this junk.
why do I have to make my bed when I'm not even gonna sleep in it?
you have to make your bed because I asked you to.
now, come on, get it together.
I don't want to miss the ceremony.
there's gonna be a ceremony? - That's right.
first, we make a sacrifice to the gods asking them to bring good waves.
a human sacrifice? - Worse...
a cherished surfboard.
ancient ritual, handed down from one generation to next, ha-ha.
someday you'll pass it on to your son.
I don't think so, Dad,
I kind of plan on being normal, if you don't mind.
why I ought to...
take it back. You know what?
if I said that to my father, you know what he'd do to me?
he'd do this.
take it back. - I take it back.
I take it back.
Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it. Hey.
Hello?
you must have the wrong phone number.
there's nobody named Rover here.
wait, wait, wait, wait! That's my brother.
uncle Buzzy? - Buzz.
Yeah.
how the hell are ya?
where the hell are ya?
what are you doing in Santa Barbara?
Yeah, we're having the ceremony.
I'm walking out the door in ten minutes.
Yeah, Trancas.
is he coming? - He's coming.
Yes!
see you there. Yeah!
Uh-oh, no!
Oh, my God. Hello, Captain.
eh, Kelly, stay in shape, will ya?
Hey, Mitch? - Hey.
what's this about your brother showing up?
I thought he was living in New Zealand.
new Guinea. New Guinea.
Oh, I knew it was "New" something.
how's it going?
you remember Cat.
Hey, Dad? Why does Uncle Buzz stay away?
I mean, how come we never see him?
really don't know, Hobe.
he left home when I was about your age.
he said he was going to find the perfect wave.
I think he's probably still looking for it.
Hey!
I'm back!
you! I want you! I am back!
give me Little Sammy. Little Sammy.
hey man, how are you?
it's good to be back!
God, it's good to see you.
where have you been? Are you still with, uh?
no. No way, are you serious?
are you still? - Nope, done deal.
no, this can't be. Hobie!
come here, you little gremmie.
Hey, how are you doing, Hobie, huh?
how are you doing, Uncle Buzzy? - All right, buddy.
he looks just like you, Rover.
he's a good-looking kid.
why do you call him Rover?
why do I call him Rover? Well, when he was a kid, he used to tag along with the big kids, like a little puppy.
Yeah, it would drive you nuts.
what are you doing?
what are you doing here?
what, do you expect me to wait in that van all day, or what?
I wanted it to be a surprise.
that's your cousin...
Kyle. - Pleased to meet you, man.
he's my son.
Hey.
Hey.
how come you never told me about him?
I suppose because his mother never said anything.
remember I was living up in Big Sur in that commune, and, well, there was this lady up there.
Ah, she was beautiful.
she looked like Julie Christie.
anyway, we dug each other and, you know me,
I'm not one for staying in a place too long.
especially for a chick.
she never said anything about being pregnant before I split, and I never heard from her again.
how'd you find out about him?
she died three months ago.
they tracked me down at Bell's Beach in Australia.
so I came back, picked him up...
he's mine.
uh, no offense or anything, but, uh, you sure?
that he's my son? - Yeah.
you ought to see him surf.
unreal.
unreal!
the Buzz Man is a papa.
ha!
how you feel about that? I mean...
what are you gonna do?
beats the hell out of me.
no, I'm serious.
I know you're serious.
you're always serious. You were born serious.
I'm the only screwup in this family.
Hey, look, Mitch.
I didn't come to talk about my problems.
I came to see my bro, hit some waves, let these two kids get to know one another.
Hey, I'm gonna pop a chill. Want one?
what's a chill?
a beer.
how old are you, anyway?
uh, 10 and a half. Almost 11.
knock yourself out.
uh, no, thanks.
go on, take a hit.
it's not like you're gonna be driving or anything.
Oh!
Hey, Hobie!
come on, guys. Custom dictates.
sacrifice must be made at stroke of midnight.
come hither. Come hither.
ladies and gentlemen! Ladies and gentlemen!
attention, please! Attention, please!
as senior member of this outrageous and bold and uniquely disgusting tribe of slackers and sleazeballs, who regularly crawl and frolic like demented lemmings to the bosom of the bountiful sea, in quest of the great ride, the endless wave.
therefore rejoice and celebrate the return to these shores of the mighty and outrageous swells that may return again to these hallowed shores.
midnight.
Ee-ee-nah-ah-loon, Kahuna. - What a joke.
danger - PIER CONDEMNED
Venice VOICE
looks like you're ready to go.
daddy! How are you?
actually, I'm a little nervous.
there's a guy down there juggling a chainsaw right next to my automobile.
did you give him some money?
don't worry, he's a professional.
you don't see that kind of thing in Pasadena very much.
that's why I moved here to Venice.
I know.
I got to tell you, Kay.
your mother and I are very proud of you.
starting your own newspaper on a shoestring budget.
that's no small accomplishment.
I'm impressed. Very impressed.
is that what you came all the way from Pasadena to tell me?
not entirely.
my firm represents the owners of the San Dimas Pier.
the bad guys, as it were.
it's not that cut-and-dried, Kay.
not now it isn't, no.
not with the two of us going head-to-head.
I'd say it's gotten rather sticky.
Hey, wait a minute. I'm not asking you to kill the story.
good, because I won't.
I just want you to listen to my side of it before you publish.
that's fair, isn't it?
it sounds fair...
which makes me highly suspicious.
come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
say, anymore of those Thai noodles?
kill it.
this reminds me of this little place in Phuket, right.
we'd be out in the water all day, you know?
and we'd come in and grease on a big bowl of these noodles.
Hey, didn't I send you a postcard from Thailand?
Oh, yeah.
um, I think I took it to show-and-tell for school.
thailand is an unreal place.
the surf is lame, but the chicks are awesome, dude.
can I have some more Coke?
Hey, can I have some?
no. Finish your milk.
Kyle gets Coke.
come on, a little soda?
here you go, Hobie.
what, Dad?
I mean, listen to yourself. That's who sound like.
don't do this. Don't do that.
you got a rule for everything.
lighten up, brah. - Why don't you shut up?
anybody want anymore chicken?
no, no, I'm done.
Hey, Buzz, got any bread?
we're gonna go cruise the strand.
wait a minute.
what do you mean "we're" gonna go cruise the strand?
we'll be home before curfew. - Don't even think it.
what is this, some kind of jail or something?
Hey, Kyle, slow down.
I happen to agree on this one.
I read where there's some gang shootings down there.
Hey, Buzz, maybe you'll get lucky.
maybe I'll get shot.
Hey, Kyle, wait a minute, man.
can I be excused? - Go on.
well, as you can see we haven't exactly bonded yet.
things are moving a little fast for him, that's all.
Yeah, for the both of us.
talk about going through some changes.
one day I'm sitting on the beach in Australia, the next day I'm some angry kid's dad.
no, it was "not" supposed to happen like this.
so you make a few adjustments.
that's life, Buzz.
there's no great mystery to being a father anyway.
a lot of common sense, instinct. You know...
remembering how Mom and Dad handled things.
Yeah, then do everything exactly the opposite.
Oh, you know, why don't you leave them alone?
they didn't make you leave home.
Hey, I left home because I didn't believe in the war.
that's why.
and he's never forgiven me for it.
what groups you in to?
well, I don't have any real favorites.
"new Kids on the Block"?
man, what a Barney.
what's a Barney?
a geek. - Oh.
you ever listen to the Dead?
the who? - The Grateful Dead.
they were my mom's favorite group.
I mean, she took me to a lot of their concerts.
it's like all these old hippies.
man, what a trip.
how did your mom die?
I mean, if you don't want to talk about it, that's okay.
no, no, that's all right.
I mean, I dream about it every night.
she, uh, she was riding her bike and this car crashed a stop sign.
never even slowed down.
just... it was just like...pow.
she, uh, she went straight up in the air.
came down right on the windshield.
you saw it?
I was right behind her.
I saw the car.
I yelled.
but she didn't hear me.
Hey, what's the matter?
my bathing suit. It's falling apart.
okay, all right, just relax.
Oh, God. - Calm down.
I'll get you in, all right?
okay.
what's going on?
Eduardo's suits are disintegrating.
what? - Yeah.
Oh, God.
Hey, you tell Eduardo I want to talk to him.
Yeah, well, take a number.
my wife said you were selling those bikinis.
Oh, I'm sorry, but they're all gone.
sold out. Perhaps next week.
Yeah, well, she wants her money back, and so do I.
as a matter of fact, we all do.
well, uh, there's a slight problem with that.
you see, all sales are final.
Oh, it's a very strict policy.
but seeing as how we're so close together, maybe I can give you a partial refund.
do you have a receipt?
Hey, man, the swells are pumping. Let's go out.
I can't. I got Junior Lifeguard.
Oh, man, bail it.
I can't.
man, that's weak.
your dad makes you do all this stuff?
no, I like it, it's fun. Besides, you learn a lot.
Yeah, like how to be a Barney.
look, man, all I can say is you're going to miss out on some gnarly waves.
where you going? - San Dimas Pier.
met some dude, said they were the hairiest break around.
you can't surf there... it's too dangerous.
not for me. Later.
wait up, Kyle. I'm coming.
pretty ridiculous.
here, Rover.
Hey, boy. Here, Rover.
sounds like a kennel in here.
thank you very much. - Yeah, yeah...
Hey. - How you doing?
did you see this? - Hey, how's Kay's article?
what article?
Venice Pleasure Fair Attracting Thousands
you are not the publisher of my newspaper...I am.
Kay, you said you were going to run the story.
what happened?
I made an editorial decision.
well, if you don't mind, I'd like to know what prompted the decision.
or is the upcoming Venice Pleasure Fair your idea of hard-hitting journalism?
okay.
I was paid a visit by the attorney for the owners.
so what? What's the problem?
he happens to be my father.
your father?
Ellis Morgan is your father?
Yeah. He said he spoke to you on the phone.
Yeah, he did, a couple of months ago, and he wasn't very helpful.
this is the first time in my entire life that he's ever asked me for a favor.
it's not about favors.
you saw what happened to that surfer, Kay.
it's about saving lives.
I know what it's about, Mitch, as does my father.
he's just trying to reach a settlement that all the parties can agree to, and he thought if I ran the story it might jeopardize the negotiations.
I don't buy any of it. Your dad's just another attorney.
it's a stall tactic.
stay away from the pier.
anyone surfing in this area, will be subject to arrest.
the pier has been condemned.
take your boards and leave the area immediately.
do not attempt to surf these waves or you will be arrested.
see, I told you.
leave the area immediately. - Let's get out of here.
leave the area immediately. - Wait a minute.
I want to check this out.
the pier has been condemned.
anyone surfing in this area will be arrested.
Hey, Hob, someone's at the door.
Hey, Eddie. - Hey, Hob.
can I come in?
Yeah, sure. - Great.
is your dad around?
uh, no, but he should be here pretty soon.
Kyle, how's it going?
Hey, you know, I missed you at Junior Guards today.
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.
I should've called.
Yeah, well, you know, I was just worried about you, that's all.
I thought maybe something might've happened to you.
uh, no, we went surfing.
Oh, yeah, where did you go?
sunset Beach.
surfing two places at one time... that's a good trick.
I saw you at the pier.
you were in the boat?
so, what, are you going to tell his old man?
no. He is.
but he'll kill me.
look, Hob, I know your dad.
I know how he feels about you, he loves you.
and he trusts you.
and that's why you gotta tell him the truth.
because if you don't, you're going to blow that trust and things will never be the same.
same goes for you.
what? I'm supposed to trust a guy who doesn't even know who I am?
or even care?
look, why don't you give him a chance?
it's a two-way street.
why don't you give a little instead of taking all the time?
Hi, guys.
Hey, Eddie, what's going on? - Nothing.
just stopped by to say hi.
stay for dinner? - You cooking?
Yeah, I'm cooking.
I don't think so, man. I'll see you later.
well, thank you.
Where's Buzz?
partying with some babe.
when's he coming back?
don't ask me.
later, Dad.
Yeah. Hello. - Mitch.
buzz, where are you?
San Clemente. I've had a couple of beers.
I don't think I should be on the road.
Aw, man, don't do this to me.
what? Your dirty work.
look, I got my hands full with my own life.
Kyle's your responsibility.
I don't know what to do with him, Mitch.
you can start by getting your butt back here.
I'll be there by noon.
can you handle it till then?
sure.
sure, I guess I'll have to.
morning, Hobe. - Morning, Dad.
how do you want your eggs?
uh, scrambled, I guess.
good. Grab some butter, will you?
Yeah, sure.
you notice there's two cans of beer missing from in there?
you know anything about that?
no, I swear.
do you think Kyle knows anything about that?
well, maybe. I mean, I can't say for sure.
something you're not telling me?
well, it's-it's not about the beer.
it's just that yesterday, Kyle wanted me to go to the pier with him, so I cut Junior Lifeguards, and I went with him.
but I-I didn't surf there or anything.
I just wanted to try and talk him out of it.
I think it's about time I had a little talk with Kyle.
wait a minute, Dad. He's not as bad as you think?
he's just got a lot of problems.
I know, Hobie, I know.
come on, K...
okay.
you got him breathing, but he's still unconscious.
let's get him down. - Okay.
on three. One, two, three.
okay, easy.
all right, ready?
and up. Let's go.
Dr. Kirchy to Emergency.
Dr. Kirchy to Emergency, please.
Hey, Mitch, how is he?
he's in a coma. It's touch and go.
how long was he under?
about two to three minutes.
his blood-gas level went down to 25.
that's right on the edge of brain damage.
I know.
we're not going to know anything until he comes out of it.
so where's Buzzy?
somewhere between here and San Clemente.
you mean he doesn't know? - No.
any change in his condition?
no... hey!
he came by headquarters.
I filled him in on the way over.
Oh, God. Bud, you okay?
I thought you were keeping an eye on him.
what was he doing out there?
what?
what was he doing out there?! - Look, don't lay this on me, man.
it's your son we're talking about.
buzz, I was the one who brought him in.
where the hell were you?
Oh, you're a real hero, huh, Mitch?
just shut up, huh?
what if he dies? - What if he lives?
can you handle that?
can you grow up?
Mitch, come on.
come on.
come on. Come on. Come on!
you got to get it together.
Mr. Jim Buchannon.
your son has regained consciousness.
all indications are he's going to be okay.
Hey. Kyle.
Hey, Buzz.
boy, you're a tough kid.
you're probably going to drive me nuts.
I just figure you're my karma for what I did to my folks.
Hey, look.
I don't know what kind of life we're going to live, but I promise you, from now on, it's you and me...
together.
you know, I'm thirsty.
do you want to get a nurse to get me a Coke?
how about some milk, huh?
whatever you say, Dad.
got a minute? - Yeah, yeah, sure.
come on in.
how is your nephew?
he's doing fine. Thanks.
that's good.
you know, I felt terrible when I heard what happened, like I was responsible.
believe me, it was not your fault.
I know... I just, well...
I should have run the story.
Kay, it was your dad. I mean, that's...
it's a tough call.
I spoke with my father. This morning...
and they reached a settlement.
demolition starts tomorrow. - Terrific.
thank him for me. - Yeah, I will.
so does this mean we're still friends?
I hope so.
don't I owe you a hotdog or something?
I think so.
you know, if it wasn't for you, Kyle would have been dead.
sometimes we get lucky.
it wasn't luck, Dad, it was you.
Thanks, pal.
I love you, Dad.
and I promise that every time you tell me to make my bed or drink my milk,
I won't ever complain.
how about doing your homework?
don't push it. - You!
so, uh, what's up with you and Kay?
you going to ask her out or what?
think I should?
well, she's pretty hot.
Really? Maybe you should ask her out.
maybe I will.
besides, she probably doesn't want to go out with you anyway!
Really? - Really.
good-bye.
other cities just keep giving a one-way bus ticket to the beach.
and then they become" our problem.
homelessness is everybody's problem.
my name's Charlie.
don't you get it? I don't have a home.
Charlie's mom's been gone since yesterday.
has she ever abandoned you?
no, and she didn't this time, either.
why are you in my house?
she's gone.
help me!
my God! She can't swim!
sandcastles
come on.
Hey, you're cheating. Get back here.
more and more of them every day.
other cities just keep giving them a one-way bus ticket to the beach.
and then, they become our problem.
Mm-mm. Homelessness is everybody's problem.
I just hope I can make the mortgage on the boat this month.
come on, one more.
Yeah.
Hey.
come on, let's go. Let's move it, all right?
come on.
Hey, what are you doing with that?
No! It's mine!
no, it's n... - Leave it alone!
Hey, hey. This isn't yours.
let's go.
come on.
this is not a hotel.
let's move it.
why don't you go down to one of those shelters, huh?
mine!
same time tomorrow. - Yeah, you got it.
sorry.
well, where's he off to in such a hurry?
the new "Surf Rider" magazine just hit the racks.
I didn't know Hobie was that into surfing.
it's the swimsuit edition.
weird. It's, like, overnight, he's gone from...
looking at skegs to checking out legs.
well, uh, maybe I should have a talk with him.
about what?
you know... the facts of life.
Thanks, Harvey, I think I can handle that.
well, I was just offering.
I mean, sometimes it's easier for a non-parent to cut through all the hemming and hawing.
there's not gonna be any hemming or hawing.
I'm perfectly comfortable talking to my son about anything and everything, thank you.
that will be $3. 50, sir, please.
$3. 75, sir.
here you go. Here's your change.
here you go.
thanks a lot. - Burritos up?
here you go, sir.
thank you very much. 75.
thank you.
thank you very much, sir. Have a good day now.
get them while they're hot.
$3. 50, sir.
thank you very much.
Thanks.
Hey, you, hold it!
What'd you put in here, huh? - Nothing! Let go of me!
what else did you steal, huh?
what else did you... - Mine!
come on... ow! If I catch you around here again, I'll have you arrested, you little thief!
who's next?
here you are, Eric.
just change the bandage twice a day.
Thanks.
just because some homeless guy took my picture, - doesn't make him dangerous. - Aw, homeless! Home...
you know what, I am really sick and tired of every vagrant and criminal on the street being called the homeless.
this guys doesn't belong in a shelter, he belongs in an asylum... Ow!
Eddie, this is gonna need stitches; it's deep.
you're right.
but you didn't see this guy.
he was crazy...
he acted like your picture was his and I was taking it away from him.
the only thing that matters is that you're okay.
wrong.
the only thing that matters is me catching this guy.
I don't know... what can I tell you, Mitch?
how's this city supposed to handle over 3, 000, when we only have 558 shelter beds?
I don't know, Garner, but something's got to be done, and something's got to be done soon.
well, Mitch, you know as well as I do there are no easy answers here.
my guards have pulled out over two dozen transients from the water in the last two months.
now we got a stabbing. I'm telling you...
it's getting dangerous out here.
wait.
Hal, bring your print kit down here.
I'll be right down.
Hey, Lea!
Where'd you go this morning?
you were gone when I got up.
what's this?
I brought your clothes, your stereo, and your toothbrush.
I've changed the locks on the door, so don't even bother trying to use your key.
good-bye, Harvey.
Hey, muscles!
don't put the stereo in the sand!
Aw, Lea, come on.
why are you doing this?
when you moved in, we were supposed to share expenses share a life together, share everything, but I guess the thrill you get out of gambling turns you on more than I do.
Oh... now, now, that is not true.
you lost the rent money at the track, the grocery money at poker... well, now you've lost me.
Good-bye! I hope the thrill was worth it.
I'm just on a cold streak. It'll turn around.
lea, come on, where am I gonna live?
Hey!
that's my harmonica.
Oh, sorry.
I was looking for you.
you dropped it when you were running away from the truck.
here.
you got your spit all over it.
Oh.
sorry.
do you know how to play it?
no. I just like the way you can hear yourself breathe.
what you writing about?
what just happened.
Oh, like a diary.
a journal.
me and my mom share it.
so, did you write about why you stole that stuff back there?
I paid him in advance, and he forgot, okay?
Hey, he's the one who ripped me off my change, and that was all the money I had.
what are you staring at?
uh, you have some chocolate right here.
you use makeup?
sometimes.
my name's Charlie.
what's yours?
listen, Hobie, I got to get to work on earning some money.
you have a job?
sort of.
here.
play this.
I don't know how.
it doesn't matter, just do like you were doing before.
you know, blow out and suck in, and move it side to side.
Yeah.
Yeah, you'll do.
no matter what anybody says, you don't answer.
don't even stop playing.
pretend like you can't even hear 'em.
Why? - Just do it.
don't dance around or anything.
just stand there.
give it a shot.
keep it up.
Hi. Excuse me, could you spare a little change for me and my brother?
Hi. Could you...
it was awful. I hated it.
well, you picked the place.
ladies, hi.
hello. - My brother and I...
we really need some money. Could you help us out?
what's wrong with him? - Will a quarter help?
Oh, thank you. See?
he can't play too well. He's deaf.
thank you. Oh, thanks.
we're saving up for a hearing aid.
we're very grateful.
Bye.
Hi.
Hi. - Hi.
my brother and I are trying to get some money for the bus home.
do you think you could help us out?
he-he can't hear you. See, he's deaf.
Yeah. Hobie!
you scared him.
Hey! Wait up!
he can't hear you!
remember?
a girl, huh?
Yeah. She's really different, Dad.
how is she different?
well, she's older.
I don't know.
I feel funny around her.
funny? How?
well, I can't think of anything to say, and everything I do say sounds stupid.
Yeah, well, women can do that to you, believe me.
why does it happen?
well, because... maybe you're saying one thing and you're thinking something else.
Yeah.
I kept on thinking about...
kissing her.
what?
am I old enough to kiss a girl, Dad?
well, I... I... uh...
look, if you don't want to talk about this...
No! No, I "do" want to talk about this.
then why are you hemming and hawing?
I'm...
well, because it's a little bit too late to get into this now, and... I don't want to have to stop in the middle.
Yeah. That probably would drive me crazy.
Yeah. I tell you what.
why don't you go upstairs, I'll tuck you in bed, and we'll get into it tomorrow?
good.
cause the stuff Harvey told me didn't make any sense.
not quite.
the eyes are still too close.
they need to be a little, I don't know, deeper set or something.
Hey, guys.
Mitch around? - Upstairs.
what's this?
eh, some creep who stabbed me at my tower yesterday.
you're kidding.
Oh, hey, Eddie.
speaking of the homeless, do you think
I could maybe stay with you for a couple of days?
just till I find a suitable place.
Aw, come on, Harv, you know how the marina feels about pets.
I'm a little cramped. You understand.
garner, my main man.
Riva doesn't even like it when "my" relatives visit.
Kay?
forget it.
wait a minute.
that's it, that's it.
now you're getting somewhere.
you know, Garner, I can run this picture in the "Voice" if that will help.
can't hurt. Thanks, Kay.
police lab just faxed over a positive ID from the prints on that shard of glass.
Hi, Kay. - Hi.
his name is Hector Clay.
they call him Hector the Collector.
apparently, he steals things from people that aren't necessarily valuable but precious to them.
you know, like keepsakes, lockets...
pictures. Of loved ones.
exactly.
then, he assumes them as his own.
this guy has a history of violent behavior.
he was serving six months at the state hospital for the criminally insane.
when did he escape?
he didn't.
they released him three weeks ago.
lack of funds.
sure, I give Hobie an allowance.
Why?
I saw him panhandling on the strand yesterday.
Hobie? No way.
Yeah, it was him. He ran away when he saw me.
Kay, it couldn't have been Hobie.
I'm "99%" sure it was him.
he was playing the harmonica... badly, I might add...
and then this little girl ran up to me and said Hobie was her deaf brother and asked me for some money.
a girl.
Hmm,"I see," said the blind man.
where were they?
Oh, uh, Rose Street benches.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
see ya. - See ya.
Hi.
why'd you run off with my stuff?
you know that lady you were asking for money?
she was my dad's friend.
why did you tell her I was your deaf brother, anyway?
tell people a sad story, they feel better when they help you out.
what are you looking for?
my mom.
she went on a job, but she's not back yet.
well, what does she do?
different things.
well, actually, she's sort of a writer... a poet.
me, too.
want to hear one of my poems?
Yeah, sure.
Oh, no.
it's gone.
what? Our journal.
maybe you left it at home.
last night.
Hey, wait up!
you lost it in here?
I must have.
I was playing around in here.
got to find it.
why are you in my house?!
let go of me!
let her go... you're hurting her!
let go of me!
let her go!
run, Charlie, run!
run!
come on!
run!
you know, I think they should take all the military bases that they're closing up and turn it into housing for the people who need it.
can't do that.
why not?
Eddie, they have tons of empty buildings and barracks and mess halls.
and the towns around those bases need people, or else they're going to die out.
Yeah, for people who want to work.
Yeah, I guarantee you that all those people would work if they'd just be given half the chance and a little bit of encouragement.
Oh, no.
what?
wait a minute, I saw that guy yesterday at the pavilion.
what are you doing?
getting him.
Shauni, he could be dangerous.
I'm not letting you near him.
let me go change that bandage, okay?
I'm fine.
no, you're stubborn.
that guy's about the same age as me.
maybe if he were a little more stubborn, he wouldn't have given up, wouldn't have tried to end his life like that.
what's the matter?
I've always been afraid that... I'd end up like him.
nowhere to live, nothing to live for.
we've all felt like that sometimes.
I mean, that's why the homeless are so hard to deal with...
because they bring out all of our worst fears.
I think we lost him.
who was that guy?
he's a loony tune.
saw him a couple of times under the bridge.
I don't believe it.
she's still not here.
maybe she's waiting for you at home.
don't you get it?
we don't have a home.
what do you mean?
where do you sleep?
shelters...
the beach...
that empty power plant.
don't worry.
she'll come.
Charlie, Charlie, my dad's here.
he'll know what to do.
Hey, Dad!
Hey, Hobester. What's going on?
nothing. Dad, this is Charlie, the girl I've been telling you about.
Oh, yeah. Hi, Charlie.
how are you?
Hi.
what's the matter, honey?
Charlie's mom's been gone since yesterday.
she had to sleep in the old power plant last night, under the bridge.
so why don't you come on over to lifeguard headquarters?
we'll see if we can find your mom, huh?
no. Now, what if she comes back and i'm not here?
well, then she'll call the police, and they'll call us at lifeguard headquarters, and we'll get you guys together.
come on, don't worry.
want to ride in the back?
29 minutes.
I can't win.
there you go.
take what you need, keep the change.
so when the plant shut down, it was really hard for mom to find work.
then, the unemployment ran out.
and when we couldn't pay the rent, we got evicted.
how long you been on the street?
three months.
mom finds work sometimes, but the money just goes for food and a place to stay.
Charlie, I got to ask you a couple of questions, and I'd like you to be honest with me, okay?
has your mom ever used drugs or alcohol?
no. - Dad...
Hobie, just a second here.
has she ever abandoned you?
no, and she didn't this time, either.
something must have happened to her.
well, we're checking with the child welfare department and...
if someone comes to get me, I swear, I'll run away.
nobody's coming to get you.
we're just checking with the hospitals and the police to see if anything happened to your mom.
we won't know anything until morning.
in the meantime, if you want to spend the night here, you're welcome.
Hobie can bunk in with me, and you can sleep in his bed.
I'll tuck you in.
can I have some more, please?
sure.
careful. Don't trip.
my dad's shirts are kind of long.
Hey, Eddie, what are you doing here?
Where's my dad?
well, he called me, and he wanted me to come over here and hang with you guys for a while.
had to take care of something, but he'll be back pretty soon.
Hi. I'm Eddie.
Hi. I'm Charlie.
Hey, that's the guy.
that's him.
who? What?
wait a minute, you saw this guy? When?
yesterday, under the bridge in the old power plant.
he grabbed Charlie.
but Hobie hit him with a piece of wood.
what's he doing in the paper, anyway?
well, that maniac stabbed me the other day.
and what were you two doing in the plant?
well, Charlie thought she lost her diary in there.
it's a journal my mom and I have been keeping.
Yeah, well, if it's special to you, Hector the Collector probably took it.
hello.
Hey, Mitch.
Yep, they're both here.
okay.
Oh. Great, great.
all right. Yeah, I'll tell her.
okay, I'll see you soon.
well...
he found your mom.
they'll be here in an hour.
is she all right?
she's fine.
where was she?
she was in jail, but it was a mistake.
a mistake?
but your dad straightened the whole thing out.
I, uh...
I better go get dressed.
Hey, Hobe!
dad!
Hobie, this is Charlie's mom, June.

Hi. Nice to meet you.
your dad's told me a lot about you.
Charlie talks about you all the time, too.
Oh, this is Eddie Kramer.
Eddie, this is June Reed. - Nice to meet you.
Hi.
Charlie's upstairs getting ready.
Hobie, why don't you go see what's taking her so long?
Yeah, sure.
are you hungry?
I mean, you want something to drink?
maybe just a glass of water.
I'll get it.
I can't thank you enough for all you've done for Charlene.
I feel so humiliated by all this.
don't.
bad things sometimes happen to good people.
she's gone!
what?
the window was open, and there was this note.
sorry to run out, but I have to go get our journal back before my mom gets here.
Charlie.
that's mine!
no, it's not!
mine.
Mitch. Mitch, over there.
give it to me!
dad! Dad, there she is!
stop it! Let go of me!
mine! No!
No!
my God, she can't swim!
meet me down there, huh?
it's okay.
I got you.
Hey!
No! My things!
my things!
they're my things!
Hector, it's okay.
please... I'll be good.
I'll be good.
Hector, it's okay.
it's all right. Nobody's going to hurt you.
she's all right.
thank you. - She's okay.
I used to think My bedroom was too small,
until I didn't have a room at all.
keep going, honey.
I woke up this morning with a snail next to my hand "I touched him, and he went into his shell "I sometimes wish I had a shell that I could call my own.
then, I wouldn't be ashamed "When someone asked me where I lived, "'Cause I'd always and forever
have a home.
that was beautiful, Charlie.
my mom's a really good writer.
I'd love to publish some of what you both have written, if that'd be all right.
it's very personal.
all good writing is.
would they get paid?
you bet.
in fact, I could use some extra help on the paper.
Really?
that'd be wonderful.
wait a minute.
Oh, don't worry, I'm not looking to move in.
I found a place to roost.
I feel sorry for the chickens.
Hey, I move in on Monday.
32 units, all stewardesses.
I thought you were broke.
roommates! The secret to luxurious living.
you have stewardesses for roommates?
well, not exactly.
you see, the deal is that I get to move into their apartments when they're away on flights.
but, uh, deals are negotiable.
Ooh, cake.
come on in.
here you go.
Thanks.
I don't know how I'd have gotten through this without you.
dad. Dad, she kissed me.
what do I do now?
you want me to handle this one, Mitch?
book a flight, Harvey.
booking.
Hobe, a kiss is like a wave.
catch the right one... unbelievable.
catch the wrong one... wipe out.
I did that?
how do you tell the difference?
well, when waves are over your head...
yeah?
stay out of the water.
tonight, on" Baywatch:
last time I saw everybody, we were still married.
now we're divorced.
mom, you came all the way from Ohio to go to this reunion, and maybe even get back together.
that's enough!
dear lifeguard, please keep my baby safe for 24 hours.
stop him!
I've been waiting for 20 years to get back at him.
reunion
right, break.
okay, come on.
hike.
pass, pass.
Yeah.
you got it, Tom!
run!
everybody, run!
go! Run!
Yeah, this is Kramer, Tower Two. Roll backup.
you're not gonna believe this one.
look out!
stay on him.
we're right behind you.
look out! - Get down!
wait! Guys, wait a minute!
guys!
please, please, don't hurt him.
it's okay. He's gentle.
please!
he's our school mascot. Oh!
sorry, sorry.
I mean, he just got spooked when some balloons popped.
remember me?
class of '72?
Trudy, hi.
how you been?
busy, busy as a little bee.
you know, Howie and I are chairing the reunion committee.
God, I cannot believe you are still a lifeguard.
Yeah.
you didn't R. S.V. P. - No.
you are coming this afternoon to the reunion, aren't you?
uh... no. I'm sorry, I can't make it.
Oh, come on.
you have to. Everybody's going to be there.
I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun, but I just can't make it.
I'm sorry, but do me a favor, will you? Keep the bull tied up.
nice to see you again, Trixie.
see ya. - Yeah.
come on, it's okay, don't cry.
don't cry.
it's okay.
would you look at that hair.
he's practically bald.
Hey, look who's talking.
Mitch was on the swimming team.
he took it real seriously.
the only thing in high school he did.
Hey, look at these girls.
I can't believe they can rent hair that high.
hey there, Long Toes, I hear you took the bull by the horns today.
unbelievable.
long Toes?
that was his nickname in high school.
I used to bring him in my office all the time because he couldn't keep his shoes on.
he was my guidance counselor.
let me see that thing.
Wow. I wonder whatever happened to that nerd.
then why don't you go to the reunion?
Yeah.
ancient history.
Mitch, the only reason that people don't go to their reunions is if they think they're not successful enough, or they don't look good.
and you look great.
it's the best you ever looked.
you look terrific.
and you are successful, Mitch.
you're more successful than most of them.
I guarantee it.
you knew what you wanted to become in high school.
not too many people can say that.
Ben, it's going nothing to do with being a lifeguard.
I'm proud of that. I'm very proud of that.
well, then, why aren't you going?
right there.
because Gayle's going.
last time I saw everybody, we were still married.
now we're divorced.
everybody's going to come up to me and say, "Oh, what a shame."
what happened?
who got Hobie?
I can't deal with that, no way.
here we go.
guys, one of you please take this thing, huh?
it's not a thing, it's a baby.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
here.
whose baby?
I have no idea.
I found it... her... along with my towel along with this note.
wait till you guys hear this.
I've stopped baby tears all my life.
could I hold her, please?
sure.
dear Lifeguard, I know your job is to save people "who are in trouble on the beach, "so please keep my baby safe for 24 hours.
I'll be back to get her.
and please don't call the authorities.
I love my baby very much, and I'd die if she was ever taken away from me.
hopefully, there are other fingerprints on this than your own.
heinz, get this to Garner, will you?
I got it.
did you see anybody at the beach today who might have possibly left her?
no. Must have snuck up from behind.
here, Ben, let me try.
I had a patented way of keeping Hobie from crying.
Ooh, little baby. Yeah.
Yeah. Maybe it just works with boys.
Wh-What?
what? What are you guys looking at me like that for?
you're the only one the baby doesn't cry with.
well, it isn't because of me.
I mean, I don't know a thing about babies. Come on.
the question is, do we contact the authorities, or do what the note says?
Ben, whoever abandoned her took a big chance you might not find her.
Yeah, but he did.
and whoever wrote that note is obviously in a lot of trouble.
so, I think maybe we should wait the 24 hours, and then if they don't show up, we can call Child Welfare.
you're the guidance counselor.
what do you think?
doesn't hurt to wait the 24 hours.
what do we do with her in the meantime?
I mean, who's going to take care of her?
no way.
you know, I think it could be time to change her diaper, Eddie.
Yeah, I got to go.
Shauni. A taxi for me?
got to go. I got to make a phone call.
buddy?
Ben? Hey, come on, man.
you're not going to leave me, are you?
watch me.
but... you...
Hobie, I'm home.
that's a big hug.
I was only away for a few hours.
how are you, Mitch?
that is a silly reason not to go to this reunion.
I know, Dad.
you always tell me it doesn't matter what other people think.
this time, it's different.
Oh, come on.
Chuck Bezanty's coming all the way from Aspen.
steve Roye's going to be there.
you guys haven't seen each other in years.
don't you think it'll look funny, you and I walking in together?
no.
in fact, I think it'd be great for people to see that just cause we got a divorce doesn't mean we can't still be friends.
and maybe even get back together.
don't count on that, pal.
you don't know for sure.
I mean, it could happen.
anyway, I can't go because I don't have anything to wear.
well, it just so happens that I brought you something.
so now you don't have any excuses.
so come on.
wait, wait, wait, wait, hold it.
who's going to take care of Hobie?
I'm staying at Jeremy's house.
and I'm going to pick him up in the morning.
we're going to spend the whole day together before I have to leave. Right?
right. - So...
uh, Gayle, I don't think it's a good idea.
don't worry.
look, I got in late, so I came straight here from the airport, but I'm going to check into a hotel right after the reunion.
okay.
I still don't want to go.
whoa, Dad, this is awesome!
Yeah, I can't believe your mom kept it all these years.
I gave this to her when we first started going steady.
how old were you guys?
seventeen.
Hey, you look pretty good.
that jacket still fits you, I see.
Yep. - So you guys ready to go?
Yeah. - Yep.
um, one thing.
I think we should take two cars.
look, I'll tell you what, if it really makes you this uptight for me to be there, then why don't I just stay here with Hobie, and you can go alone?
Gayle, I didn't mean... - Mom, you came all the way from Ohio to go to this reunion.
Yeah, well, I also came to see you.
tell you what, I never wanted to go in the first place.
you go, I'll stay here with Hobie.
Mitch, we don't have to walk in together.
we don't even have to be with each other.
let's just go, we'll have a good time, then you drive me back here, I get my stuff, and I check out.
all right.
thanks for the jacket.
since we weren't going steady anymore, I really thought you should have it.
come on. - Come on.
tell me, what was the most embarrassing thing that ever happened to you in high school?
no way. No way.
say...
you look good.
you're looking good, man.
so are you. What you up to?
I haven't looked this good in a long time.
give me a smile.
good luck.
beer.
I don't believe it!
Oh, Gayle!
I am so... - Look at you!
I read your stuff all the time.
that's right.
I got to go talk to my wife... ex-wife.
tell me, what was the most embarrassing thing that ever happened to you in high school?
God.
what?
I was hoping I'd see you.
you haven't changed at all.
well, obviously you have, because I have no idea who you are.
and if you looked like this in high school, I think I would remember.
I sat behind you for years.
Yep.
fated by alphabetical order to know every curl of your hair.
until you shaved it off.
did you know I actually cried that day?
no, I didn't know that.
I did.
you had such beautiful hair.
I'm surprised you're wearing shoes.
and I'm surprised you're not wearing a size 12 dress, horn-rimmed glasses and braces.
well, some people peak in high school.
still a wiz at science?
I own a computer software company.
well, you definitely have all the right reasons to come to this reunion.
good to see you.
watch me now!
how are you guys?
how are you?!
how you doing, man? - I'm doing okay.
my hands hurt from that slap though.
Oh, man!
no. What? It's okay.
Eddie, don't hold the baby like that, honey.
you have to cradle her in your arms.
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.
you mean like a football?
Yeah. - Yes, yes.
how's that? Is that better, huh?
go out for a pass.
I'm kidding.
I'm just kidding, come on.
now comes the fun part.
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't want anything to do with it.
come on, be brave.
just set her down right here.
I'm going to put you down.
there you go. - There you go.
watch out for your little head there.
there you go.
go ahead.
take the old one off.
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not going in there.
you know, somebody had to do this for you.
and that's probably why I was put up for adoption.
I'm going to get you for this.
okay.
all right.
Hey.
she's a good girl. - Yeah.
call 911.
okay. Ooh.
Oh, it's not that bad.
Yes, it stinks very bad.
wipe.
you stink.
Yeah.
powder. Easy.
diaper.
uh, what do I do with that?
see this tape? - Uh-huh.
pull 'em out, and just wrap it around the front.
you got it. - Okay.
okay.
it's a piece of cake, huh?
piece of cake.
Yes, it's a piece of cake.
huh? Yes!
huh? How's that?
not bad, Mr. Mom.
What'd I tell you?
this is a piece of cake, huh?
she smiled.
she smiled at me.
she actually smiled at me.
come here, you.
come here. Work with me, will you?
Thanks.
no, no, no.
Gayle, you have to say this loud enough so the whole world can hear.
now, what was the most embarrassing moment you ever had in high school?
okay, okay.
most embarrassing thing that ever happened to me in high school was the time that she got caught with me in the boys' locker room.
Hey, I don't know who you are.
sure you do.
I'm the one you always wanted.
you know, the guy that you were too shy to come after back then, huh?
Yeah, right. Look, um...
I always wanted to kiss you in high...
one for the camera, one for the...
that's enough!
come a long way since high school, haven't you, Veron?
Mitch, let him go.
soon as he apologizes.
what do you give a damn for?
heard she dumped you.
only one being dumped on at the moment is you.
now, say you're sorry!
for everything you've ever done to anyone here.
Yeah.
I'm going to get both of you!
say you're sorry.
sorry.
say it loud enough for everybody in here to hear.
go on!
I'm sorry, okay?!
you know, you always thought you were a hot shot, Buchannon.
well, you ain't nothing!
I own three auto parts stores, and I make more money in a month than you make in a year on the beach!
no wonder she dumped you!
sorry about that.
you okay?
my hero.
Thanks.
get some air, huh?
beer.
it's time to eat!
it's not cafeteria food, trust me.
Mitch, you have to! - No way.
Yeah, come on, man.
we already talked to the band.
it's been 20 years, pal.
outside, it was perfect, - like we rehearsed it yesterday. - No.
come on, we'll blow 'em away.
seize the moment, Mitch!
Oh, come on, Mitch. - Not you, not you.
don't you... no. - Mitch, please.
it'll be fun. - Don't embarrass me.
you broke my heart.
because I couldn't dance.
you didn't even want me around.
and now I'm back to let you know I can really shake 'em down.
watch me now!
watch me now!
Oh, no, no, no, no.
this one's too hard.
why don't you get the other one?
Yes. You know what? It's a little stuffy in here, too.
maybe we should open the doors.
no. No, we can't do that, cause then, she'd catch a cold, because it'd be too cold for her, huh?
Yes.
there's something wrong with this bottle.
maybe the temperature is not right, or something.
sweetie. It's okay.
let me have the baby.
she's almost asleep.
Oh, baby.
everything is okay.
Oh, yes. - Hi, sweetie.
we're going to make you comfy.
Oh, yeah, now, there.
Oh, yeah. That's comfy, that's good.
Yeah.
I want to have three babies.
I want to have two boys and a girl.
what about you?
you know that we have never even talked about that before.
Oh, I don't know.
all I know is when I become a father, the mother and I are going to stay together forever.
no fights, no breakups.
I went through all that hell, and I swore my kid would never go through it.
Yeah, but there's no such thing as a "100%" guarantee, Eddie.
I mean, all you can do is do the best you can one day at a time with the person you love.
Yeah, you're right.
you know anyone I can do that with?
Oh, very funny. Ha-ha...
hush! You're going to wake the baby.
Oh, shut up and kiss me, will you?
baby, baby, baby... everything's about the baby.
Oh, I love you, too. - What about Shauni?
Oh, Shauni didn't get any attention.
shut up and kiss me.
seeing the three of you up there, it felt like we were back in high school, really.
Thanks.
for what?
for making me come.
I'm having a great time.
tell me something.
do I look, you know, very different than I did back in high school?
Gayle, why are you so insecure?
you look beautiful.
you look as beautiful as ever.
well, good... that means all the facials and workouts have been worth it.
we came out here the day of our prom, you remember?
right after the dancing started?
Yep. Snuck out here to be alone.
so you want to?
what?
sneak off and be alone.
we're out of here.
we should get a camera, take a picture of his face when the wave hits him.
he wakes up and sees where he is...
I'm not going to need a picture to remember this moment.
I've been waiting for 20 years to get back at him.
I think about you a lot, Mitch.
I... I miss you.
I miss you, too.
I got to tell you.
you're doing a great job with Hobie.
really, it makes it so much easier for me to deal with being away from him, just knowing that he's with you.
Thanks.
that means a lot.
what the... - Hey, Veron.
Hey, Lar. - How are you doing, buddy?
get me out of here!
I'm going to kill you both.
m- Maybe, maybe if you beg us, we will, Veron.
come on, Veron, beg.
beg a little bit.
just-just a little bit. Come on, beg.
uh, may... maybe we should dig him out.
come on, he's the one supposed to panic, not us.
this is where Hobie got started.
no, I think it was down the beach...
all right, it's where we got started doing what started him.
how we waited till our senior prom night, I'll never know.
it wasn't me.
you're the one that kept saying no.
well, I won't say no tonight.
that's one of the things about you I miss the most.
Yeah!
beg, come on, beg, Vermin!
beg! Like-like on prom night, when I begged you to leave me alone, and you chased me out into the ocean in front of everybody, in front of my date!
get me out, please, come on, please!
please!
no. - Howie.
you see how scared he is?
the tide is getting higher.
come on.- Okay, okay.
we'll dig him out far enough that he can get the rest of the way out himself, then we run, okay?
all right, yeah, good.
man, the water is filling up the hole, Howie!
we got to get him out of here.
help!
help, someone!
help us, somebody!
help!
what is it?
I don't know.
it's Mitch! Mitch! Mitch, quick!
it's Veron! We buried him!
we can't get him out!
we were just trying to scare him!
get that trashcan over there... hurry!
Oh, my God.
what can I do?
get the shovels.
all right, turn it upside down!
okay, now lower it over his head when the wave comes.
here comes the wave.
okay, now.
okay, pull it up.
Dig! Dig!
here comes another one.
you got this one?
Yeah.
can you get the other leg, Mitch?
pull it out. - Okay.
here comes another one.
okay, pull it up and dig!
Dig!
I got a leg.
let's get him out of there.
I can't move him.
I can't move him, Mitch.
lift, two, three, go!
hold on! Easy.
that was great, Mitch.
thanks for you help.
we're sorry.
Bye, Gayle.
Thanks.
thank you.
the culprits are fleeing.
don't worry.
worrying about what Veron's going to do to them when he comes to will be punishment enough.
I still can't believe that happened.
one minute I'm kissing you, the next minute I've got my lips pressed against Larry Veron's.
well...
it's been an interesting day.
Oh, it's been a wild one, that's for sure.
well...
Yeah.
I guess some things, um...
are just left unfinished.
I don't know. Maybe it's for the best, huh?
guess I'd better go change.
okay.
um, do you mind if I use your shower?
no. No, go on.
I mean, you know, believe me, I'll be in there right after you are.
okay.
who's John?
he's a man that I've been seeing.
now? With your eyes closed, you're seeing him now?
I don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
you... you have to know who you were thinking about.
I never know.
I've been seeing John for about a year.
um, and he's asked me to marry him.
but sometimes, when I'm with him, I start thinking about you.
do you call out my name?
I have, yeah.
but he understood.
in fact, it was John who was the one who urged me to come to this reunion.
he said that I should sort out my feelings about you and tha if I was in love with you, I should either get back together with you or let you go.
it's not about love, is it?
I'll always love you.
I know that.
and I hope you'll always love me.
maybe it's time, huh?
maybe it's time for both of us to let go.
okay.
you know what tonight is?
no. What?
it's our graduation.
how you doing?
what can I do for you?
uh, yesterday afternoon, I left our baby girl under your tower.
l- I'm really sorry.
I mean, I know it was wrong.
it's just that my wife wanted to give her up for adoption and I just...
but things are okay now, so I'm-I'm here to pick her up.
Hey. - Hey.
this here is Dan Gerson.
he says he's the baby's father.
I am her father.
well, wait a minute. Wait.
when we find something on the beach and somebody comes here to claim it, we at least make them describe it.
so what color eyes does he have?
it's a she.
her name's Elizabeth, and she has blue eyes.
and if you'll look, a mole on her right thigh.
okay?
come here, darling.
thank you.
okay.
wait, wait, wait a minute. Dan, um, just do me a favor, would you?
write down part of what you wrote on the note.
sure.
Hey!
stop him!
watch the baby!
watch the baby.
got a lady here says she's the mother.
it's okay. Yeah. It's okay.
it's okay.
it's okay. Mama's here. Mama's here.
mama's here.
Oh, God, I never should've left you alone.
I'll never leave you alone again, I promise.
and he'll never take you away from me.
it's okay.
Yeah.
okay.
so the ex-husband tracked her down here tried to steal the baby.
that's why she left her with us, until she could get away from him.
that's right, but he caught her made her tell him where the baby was.
so Garner took him downtown to sort the whole thing out.
there you have it.
you know, it's a good thing I have great instincts about babies.
Hey, hey, hey!
so, Mitch, how was that reunion, huh?
pretty boring, I bet.
it had its moments.
Hey!
how was Disneyland?
great.

Windsor Castle is the ultimate monument to English tradition.
but it's also more than that.
it's a building that at different times in our history has stood as a symbol of momentous change.
Windsor is the oldest, and the largest inhabited castle in the world.
it's been home to the country's monarchs for almost 1, 000 years.
and it certainly looks every inch an ancient medieval fortress.
but the fascinating thing with this castle is that not everything about it is as it seems.
from the outside, the heavy stone battlements and looming towers make it a forbidding spectacle.
yet what makes it so special is how a castle was transformed into a palace.
because Windsor is the creation of different monarchs, each with their own style and ambition.
the elegant rooms, the works of art, the grand and the intimate, the strange and the exotic.
during its long life, Windsor has been many things
a home to medieval chivalry and romance, a baroque palace to restore royal fortunes after a king lost his head, and an architectural fantasy.
the state apartments at the heart of Windsor seem a world apart from the stern castle walls that enclose them.
so many objects within these rooms have stories to tell of the nation's history, through all its shifting fortunes.
of all the treasures of Windsor Castle, perhaps this extraordinary painting speaks most powerfully of the glory, and in some cases the tragedy of the monarchs who passed through here.
this unusual triple-headed study is of Charles I at the height of his powers.
and the artist, Van Dyck, was asked to paint it this way as a study for a later sculpture.
but it's a masterpiece in its own right.
I mean, look at the quality of the fabrics, for example.
and then how he's captured the character of King Charles and his air of melancholy.
and, in fact, when you look at it, you can't help but remember that this is a king who soon lost his head, at a dark and uncertain time for the nation.
Windsor Castle is full of gems like this - objects that are not only beautiful in themselves, but are also clues to the lives of the kings and queens who, in their different ways, have helped shape this unique building.
the castle's story begins with William the Conqueror.
around 1070, just a few years after he'd invaded England,
william chose to build a fortress at Windsor, at the top of a steep chalk cliff.
he chose this location for a good reason.
this is easily the highest spot for miles around.
you'd have seen the enemy coming from a long way off.
and strategically it was important too, commanding the main route west out of London.
in its early years, the castle was a military machine, designed to maintain tight control of the land around it.
the original appearance of that ancient castle is now almost hidden by later changes...
..but if you know where to look, you can still find evidence of its war-like origins.
now, this is an office just tucked away in a corner of Windsor Castle.
but look under here.
as if by magic, just lift these, and the medieval castle emerges.
because if you were a soldier in Windsor under siege, you'd need a way to get out.
and this is the secret passage.
this is exactly what it looked like in the 1200s. You can see it's wide enough to accommodate a whole army of men, you can imagine them rushing down the stairs, and it leads out on to the street.
and this is the clever bit - they'd then be able to sneak up on the enemy and attack them from behind.
for nearly three centuries, the castle remained more of a fortress than a royal home.
but one king's dream of a more heroic England was to change that completely.
edward III came to the throne in 1327
Windsor castle is Edward III's birthplace and he is associated with Windsor Castle from the day of his birth.
that's not just because it's where he came from, it's also because he is prophesied to be the great king that comes out of Windsor, who will conquer France, the saviour of England and who will achieve great things.
so his fortunes are bound up with Windsor Castle from day one.
the Windsor prophecy would soon become a reality, as Edward led England to victory against the French.
but perhaps Edward's greatest achievement was at Windsor Castle itself.
edward III had a new vision for the castle.
he would transform Windsor into the home of English chivalry - a new Camelot.
this would be an age of courtly love, when knights sought honour both in battle, and in romance.
edward created a new order of knights - the Order of the Garter.
his dream was to recreate the glories of the Round Table and the Court of King Arthur.
the first tournament of the Order of the Garter is held on St George's Day, 1349.
that is at the very height of the Black Death, when 40% of the country is dying around him.
even in the face of this terrible calamity that had come to England, it's a demonstration that it's royalty as usual, it's business as usual, it's Edward being a king as usual.
so the Order of the Garter is a powerful symbol.
for centuries to come, Windsor would remain home to Edward's illustrious order of knights.
and his vision would culminate in one of the finest of all medieval buildings
the spectacular St George's Chapel, spiritual home of the Order of the Garter.
there are some wonderful details on the building, like the animals known as the King's Beasts that perch along the top.
there are 76 of these heraldic creatures in all
such as the bull for bravery, the griffin for vigilance, the unicorn for strength, the swan for grace and perfection.
but what makes St George's Chapel so special is the soaring windows.
gothic architecture was all about height and light.
and the sheer quantity of stained glass held up by delicate stone tracery makes the interior feel vast and almost supernaturally lit.
once inside, rows of carved stone angels draw the eye up to one of the last great flowerings of English gothic
this magnificent fan vault ceiling, studded with badges of the Knights of the Garter.
the legacy of the Garter has endured.
it is now the oldest surviving order of chivalry in the world.
but by the 1500s, the medieval world of Edward III was well and truly over.
england would enjoy a time of relative peace and plenty.
so castles everywhere were falling out of favour.
english kings and queens began to value comfort over battlements.
but the castles of England, and Windsor among them, were to have one last day in the firing line.
by the 1640s, the country was in the grip of a bitter civil war.
castles were once more being used to fight bloody battles.
the King himself, Charles I, was captured and imprisoned here, in his own royal castle.
a month later, he was executed.
after a public beheading in Whitehall, Charles's body was buried at Windsor.
monarchy was abolished, and Oliver Cromwell was in charge.
Cromwell's men set about flogging off all the King's assets.
now, Charles I was the first great royal art collector, and there was a monumental quantity of paintings and precious objects to be disposed of.
Windsor Castle itself was very nearly sold off, but parliament voted by the narrowest of margins to keep it.
it was a low point for the castle, and yet it paved the way for a glittering transformation.
within the walls of the castle, the son of Charles I, Charles II, created a sumptuous palace, to revive once more the glories of royalty.
it was a bold move after the anti-monarchist years of Cromwell's republic, when it had seemed impossible a king would ever again sit on the English throne.
if Charles II was going to avoid losing his head like his father, he needed to re-establish a clear sense of royal authority.
and Windsor Castle was key to his plan.
right from the start of his reign in 1660,
Charles wanted to reconnect with the royal past.
but he set about it with a flamboyance never before seen in England.
this is the King's dining room, and appropriately enough, the theme is food.
just look at this amazing ceiling painted by the celebrated Antonio Verrio.
and it certainly lives up to its title, The Banquet Of The Gods.
Charles chose to create his palace in the latest style sweeping through Europe - baroque.
its grandeur and ambition proclaimed the restoration of the monarchy.
I think the Baroque style fitted very well with Charles II's sense of what monarchy looked like, it was big, bold, it smacked you on the chops.
it's not a restrained style, it's kind of exuberant, it's colourful, and it's full of human beings.
it's kind of fleshy, if you like.
it really was like a fabulous stage set.
for the walls, Charles employed the master carver, Grinling Gibbons, to create some of the plumpest, most luscious fruit, flowers and animals you'll ever see in wood.
Charles II spared no expense in reflecting the glory of his rule.
and certainly, anyone walking in here would know immediately that the austerity of the Cromwell years was over, and a new era had dawned.
and where Charles's father had been seen as cold and distant,
Charles knew he needed to be more approachable
albeit in a suitably regal way.
so he created a new architecture for a new court.
this sequence of rooms gives us a good idea of how the system worked.
you started off in the larger, more public rooms, and then depending on your importance and status, you'd be allowed to penetrate further and further into the private rooms, and therefore closer to the King.
and you'd know you'd made it if you got this far.
this is the King's bedchamber.
he didn't actually sleep here
that was in a private, smaller room elsewhere.
but this is where he would perform a ritualised getting-out-of-bed called a levee, which is an idea he brought over from France.
and he would actually get out of bed in his underclothes, the pages of the body would dress him, and those lucky enough to be invited in to watch could take the opportunity to have an informal word with the King.
a bit of networking, if you like.
Charles II had a PR job on his hands to reinforce that message that monarchy is the most glorious thing, to which everybody must instinctively owe their loyalty.
but he does it in a way that makes people feel warm towards him, because what he does is push back the boundary of where the sort of closed door is, so that people are able to come into his inner rooms and see him doing a lot of domestic things that no-one would have...
only a really small number of people would have seen Charles I doing.
within two years of Charles's restoration as king, he married.
the new queen arrived in England in April 1662.
this spectacular scene on the ceiling is of Charles's Portuguese wife,
Catherine of Braganza.
she's being transported up on the clouds of heaven, and winged zephyrs are supporting her billowing canopy.
but in reality, Catherine had a lot to put up with.
she often felt upstaged by Charles's string of mistresses, most notably the luscious Nell Gwyn.
Charles's wife had an almost impossible position, really.
he was fond of her, and when she arrived at Court he said, "I want to be the best husband I could possibly be" to her, his intentions were good.
but the kind of, you know, the attractions of the beauties of his Court proved too much of an eye-catch for him.
so he doesn't remain faithful to her.
but the thing that was the real killer for her was that she wasn't able to have children, and as a Queen, this is your primary role, is to provide an heir.
and she was obviously haunted by it.
in the end, Charles stuck by his wife
but he was always seen as the king who loved pleasure, whether it was women or art.
and to furnish his magnificent new palace at Windsor, he resolved to restore the fortunes of the royal art collection.
most of it had been sold off by Cromwell to repay debts.
now Charles began to hunt it down and reclaim it.
some of it was easy - from Cromwell's widow alone, he managed to retrieve 17 cartloads of paintings and sculptures and other precious objects. And this room is a kind of memorial to just a tiny selection of Charles I's paintings, here by great Italian Renaissance masters.
there's one in particular that caught my eye.
this is thought to be by Titian.
on first appraisal, it looks like the artistic equivalent of a top-shelf magazine.
but no-one's quite sure what's happening in this painting.
has the young woman fainted, and the man is actually feeling her heartbeat, or is she a faithless wife, he is her lover and that's her cuckolded husband behind her?
there's a lot of mystery surrounding this painting.
but one thing's for sure, it's rather saucy.
Charles was both sensuous and serious in his love of the arts.
and nothing has a more important place in the collection that Charles assembled than the drawings of the Renaissance artist and anatomist Leonardo da Vinci.
now, tell me about this book.
this album, which is now empty, was the album in which 600 drawings by Leonardo came to England in the 17th century, into the collection in the reign of Charles II.
so the largest quantity of Leonardo drawings of flowers, of plants...
and his studies for paintings,
the Last Supper, Madonna and Child with St Anne, all in here.
and so then they were cut out, were they?
well, they were removed, shall we say, in Queen Victoria's reign for individual mounting, so they could be exhibited, and to prevent them rubbing against each other on the pages.
and then this was originally in this book? Yes.
he's got this absolutely perfect, it's very tender, this little drawing, isn't it?
it's a beautiful thing, little curled up figure with red chalk, feeling like flesh and blood. Very moving.
incredible. And what about this, this is his famous mirror writing? It's his backwards writing.
Yes, because he was left handed, he wrote throughout his life in mirror writing. And why did he do that?
we don't really know. It must have been simpler for him, as a left hander, without smudging the ink.
and so all his writing here, what's he doing here, he's making notes about...?
he would use these sheets as little mementoes and he would remind himself of whatever it was he was studying at any one time.
now we've got both sides of the page here.
look at that.
now what are we seeing here, is that a liver?
Yes, it's a study of the internal organs of the foetus.
Leonardo clearly dissected pre-term children.
Yuk! Were they allowed to do that?
Yes, he was doing it in monastery hospitals in full knowledge of the church.
in a Catholic country? How surprising.
as long as it was done respectfully there was direct papal sanction to conduct this sort of work.
when Charles II acquired these, would he have felt that they added to his stature as a monarch interested in the arts and in sciences?
he clearly had an interest in the arts and the sciences, he founded the Royal Society.
I think they would have been regarded primarily as a curiosity in many ways, rather than understood in the way we do today.
so they wouldn't have been regarded as works of art? Yes, both works of art and scientific studies.
Leonardo had a reputation at the time as a bizarre genius in some ways, and it was very obvious that he was taking the subject far beyond what anybody else at the time was doing.
these drawings are unique, they are probably the jewel of the entire collection.
by the time building work was completed on Charles's palace, he had only one year left to enjoy it.
he died in 1685.
for the next 100 years, Windsor went into decline, as successive monarchs chose to spend their time elsewhere.
a series of watercolours by the artist Paul Sandby show that by the 1770s, parts of the castle had become almost a public thoroughfare.
so what have we got here?
this is a rather wonderful cross-section of English life in the 1770s. What's this chap doing?
this is a knife grinder, sparks coming off, and tiny boy for going up chimneys. Black from head to foot.
black from head to foot, exactly, contrasting with these posh girls.
this is the water carrier, this lady beating her mules, and behind is water.
so was it just that anybody could kind of... Once the monarchs had started to live elsewhere, it just became open season at Windsor?
people could just come in the gates and wander round as if it were a town?
up to a point, it was still a military garrison, and so you see in these views, you see soldiers around the place.
and in one of them, you can see a lady in a red cloak.
and one of the surviving printed instructions that we have says specifically that ladies in red cloaks are not allowed into the quadrangle, the upper area. Why?
cos that was considered a bit racy?
well, they were presumably people of ill repute.
this sad lady has got a crutch and a basket and a red cloak.
I think she's perhaps even lost her leg.
she has, yes, I don't think she looks racy, but...
indeed. And what about this, what have we got here?
here it looks very run down, there's a door hanging off its hinges, so it's in a real state of disrepair.
it looks like weeds are growing out of the top here.
Yeah. And here you have a soldier chatting up a pretty girl here.
while this chat-up is going on, this old crow is looking out of the window saying, "You stop that!
meanwhile, there's a punch-up going on behind this gate which is about to fall off.
Fisticuffs! Fantastic.
so it gives the impression of a slightly run-down extension of the town.
Yes, indeed.
and certainly not a royal castle.
by now, the castle was little more than a public thoroughfare.
then, in 1776, George III decided to move the royal household back to Windsor.
though to begin with, they didn't actually live in the castle.
unlike his ancestor Charles II, George III was a much more sober, serious-minded kind of chap with simple taste and a love of the countryside.
his nickname was Farmer George.
and rather than move into this rambling old castle, he and his family chose to live in a much more modest building that once stood on this very spot - the Queen's Lodge.
you can just imagine them gazing out their window at what was a dilapidated old castle
a bit like having an oversized romantic ruin at the bottom of your garden.
unlike George I and II - both born and raised in Germany
george III was eager to prove he was an English king through and through.
he would restore Windsor Castle as a royal home.
repairs began in 1781.
george and his family gradually moved into the castle that was always rather short on home comforts.
there were no carpets for example
the King thought they were unhygienic.
and it was always freezing.
queen Charlotte complained bitterly that, "This is the coldest house "that ever existed, and all idea of comfort is vanished with it.
george III is often remembered as the King who went mad.
it's now thought he suffered from porphyria, a chemical imbalance of the brain that caused bouts of insanity.
in fact, when he was well,
george was an intelligent, if eccentric man, who appreciated the arts.
in 1789, when George III was 50
and had recovered from his first serious bout of madness, this glorious china service was commissioned to celebrate his return to health.
it's of the finest French Sevres porcelain, and it's a tea and coffee service.
and you can see the plates here, each one with a cursive G for George...
the coffee cups...
..the tea cup...
and the rather charming slops bowl, as it was known, where you could put the detritus from your plates.
and each piece has a celebration of the King, if you like.
so here, "Huzza the King is well!
then we have...
the Patron of Arts," because George III founded the Royal Academy.
then my particular favourite, "The Best of Fraters."
that's supposed to be "The Best of Fathers," but it is French, so I suppose we can allow them the odd spelling mistake.
when the King's reason finally deserted him for good,
Windsor Castle became his prison.
he was kept under lock and key for the sake of his own safety...
and the safety of others.
this remarkable and rather heartbreaking little portrait of George III is of him in the last few months of his life.
and you won't see another royal portrait like this, because they are always designed to project status, power and wealth.
and here, look, he's just a frail old man.
and by this time, he was hopelessly mad, completely deaf, and he's staring into a middle distance he can't actually see, because he was completely blind as well.
soon after this was painted, the King was dead.
now the crown passed to a very different character...
his son, who would completely reinvent Windsor Castle.
george IV has gone down in history as one of the most unpopular monarchs of all time
bloated, self-indulgent, ludicrously extravagant.
but he had an eye for great art, and a real creative vision.
and though it made him unpopular at the time, we're reaping the benefits now.
because the Windsor Castle we see today, with its romantic skyline of turrets and battlements, is essentially George's creation.
in 1824, George IV commissioned Windsor's most ambitious scheme yet, to transform the castle's hotchpotch of styles into a single gothic invention.
where there were plain walls, he spiced them up with parapets...
arrow loops...
gargoyles...
..and pointed gothic arches.
for George, the central Round Tower wasn't dramatic enough, so he added an extra 30 feet in height!
his was a romantic idea of how a medieval castle should look.
I think George IV is creating a fantasy castle, if you like.
it's all about recapturing the past and identifying with those great medieval monarchs.
often the great medieval fighting monarchs, like Edward III, like Henry V.
it's his celebration of British history, almost to make people forget that his dynasty, of course, was intrinsically German.
but inside the palace, George looked forward, not back.
george modernised what was a draughty, run-down building with the greatest luxuries of the day, and filled it with his favourite art and furniture.
george adored the grand and extravagant.
and nobody did grand and extravagant better than the French.
and luckily for George, while he was Prince of Wales, the French Revolution was happening, releasing a cultural goldmine of treasures.
so, while the French aristocracy were being marched towards the guillotine,
george had no scruples in snapping up their masterpieces
going cheap - and shipping them to England.
george was the collector par excellence of objects that, to our eyes, look outrageously over the top.
but they're undeniably examples of supreme craftsmanship.
I think it's fair to say that George IV's motto could well have been, "Never knowingly underspent or understated.
and this fabulous ornamental cup is a prime example of that.
it's a masterpiece of its kind.
it's from Germany, it's silver gilt and exquisitely carved ivory.
and it's a hunting scene, so we've got Diana here, goddess of the hunt, surrounded by her sleeping nymphs and various animals associated with the hunt.
we've got boars and rabbits here.
and then here's Hercules, propping the whole lot up.
and then more contemporary hunting scenes round here.
now, the thing is, when George IV bought this, it just wasn't quite splendid enough for him, so he had these ivy leaves added.
and also emeralds, rubies and turquoise, just to make it...
that little bit more splendid.
Oh, and these days, the cup has earned itself an affectionate nickname here at Windsor Castle - it's known as The Brain.
george IV bought some marvellous things, but he had a butterfly mind, and his attention span was very short.
he loved things when he got them, but week after, was either bored and tried to sell them or often tried to augment them.
you know, putting gilt mounts on a piece, adding more jewels.
it's a constant reinvention of his marvellous collection.
sometimes George added such lavish embellishments to his treasures, it's hard to tell what they were originally designed for.
now, when I look at this fantastic confection of a clock, I must admit that the fact it's a clock is the last thing I notice, cos then you've got all this on top.
this statuette was added on by George IV, wasn't it?
Yes, George and the Dragon was very much a sort of castle symbol of the patron saint
you see George and the Dragon appear all over the castle.
so he had this mid 17th-century piece put on top of the casket.
now, this bit is a reliquary, isn't it? So for keeping holy relics. Yes.
and this book inside, what is it?
that's General Gordon's Bible.
which is from a different period? Yes.
general Gordon, the great Victorian military hero, who died at the siege of Khartoum.
it's seen a bit of wear, this Bible, hasn't it?
Yes, some people say that that's his blood on that page there.
Ooh! Ooh, my goodness.
but we can't be sure? No.
it's a great story, though. Yes, it is.
the section with the clock face is from yet another period, isn't it?
Yes. The clock itself is from 1734. So the time of George II.
Absolutely. But George IV embellished it with all these scrolls here.
Oh, I see, the dragons.
cos he loved the exotic, didn't he? Yes, absolutely.
and so we have the clock movement behind here and the organ down here.
there's an organ in here? I thought it was a stand!
no, it's an organ. It plays ten pieces by Handel, five of which he arranged specially for the clock. Can we hear it? Yes, certainly.
fantastic! Yes.
Oh, that's almost frenetic! That's so fast, isn't it?
if I make it much slower, it doesn't get over the whole tune. Oh, I see. Wow. Yes.
at the heart of Windsor Castle is a celebration of what George IV saw as his proudest moment.
on the 18th June 1815, while George was still Prince Regent,
britain had defeated Napoleon at Waterloo.
after 16 years of war, at last there could be peace in Europe.
for George, the victory would always feel somehow personal.
george sees himself, rather oddly, as the nemesis of Napoleon, although in fact he plays, you know, only a walk-on role in Napoleon's defeat.
his fantasy, increasingly as his reign wore on, was he really was at the Battle of Waterloo and he'd led the charge that won the battle, and of course he was King, so no-one said, "I think you're wrong there.
and the perfect place for George to play out his heroic fantasy...
was Windsor Castle.
this room, today known as the Waterloo Chamber, is the final result of a tribute dreamt up by George IV and, typically, on a monumental scale.
he commissioned these portraits of the great and the good, deemed to be key players in the defeat of Napoleon.
and George himself is here, of course
he wanted to make sure he was counted among the heroes!
but pride of place is given to a magnificent portrait of the Duke of Wellington, who of course led Britain's troops in the final battle against Napoleon.
and just look at him!
grand, imposing, every inch a victor, brandishing his sword under a Roman-style triumphal arch.
and if you look carefully in the background, you can just see a procession leading up to St Paul's Cathedral for a service of celebration.
the nation's sense of relief at defeating Napoleon was overwhelming, rather like VE Day in 1945.
before long, there was a national craze for commemorative objects from the war.
and one of the strangest mementos, which is kept here at Windsor Castle, is the musket ball that killed Admiral Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar.
so this is actually taken from Admiral Nelson's body.
but you have part of his uniform and gold braid that came with the musket ball through his body.
and also gold braid that's fused to the remains of the musket ball.
Oh, yes, you can see the braid actually on the musket ball there.
and without wishing to be too gruesome, the reason that is attached to the musket is because as it passed through his body, it took some of the braid with it?
that's right, and his uniform.
it hit his left shoulder, entered his lung, severed some arteries and lodged in his spine.
so he didn't stand a chance, did he?
no, he died with his officers on the Victory.
he's reputed to have said, "Kiss me, Hardy." I don't know if he did or not.
well, according to the... according to the accounts, he did.
right.
well, it was clearly an emotional moment.
who took this out of his body, then?
right, the ship's surgeon was called Dr William Beatty.
he took the musket ball and placed it in this locket. Did he wear it?
it's believed that he did, yeah.
and he finally bequeathed it to William IV, who put it with, I think, a lot of pride into the Royal Collection.
so it's an extraordinary treasure but very gruesome.
it certainly is.
george IV didn't live long enough to see his new apartments at Windsor completed.
the first monarch who made full use of them was George's niece...
queen Victoria.
Windsor Castle would become a playground for Victoria's young family...
..as well as a place to entertain the grandest of visitors.
but for Victoria, the castle ultimately became a place of grief.
after her beloved Albert died of typhoid in 1861, she spent many hours secluded behind these walls, shrouded in black, earning herself the nickname "The Widow Of Windsor."
yet Windsor would once again become a symbol of the nation's identity.
in the dark days of the First World War, Victoria's grandson, George V, dropped the royal family's German name of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.
so by proclamation on 17th July 1917, the Royal family became known as the House of Windsor.
it's extraordinary to think that the name the royal family chose
and are still known by today
was the name of a building.
this building.
they chose it, because Windsor was the greatest symbol they had of Britain's strength and sovereignty.
the House of Windsor was one of the few European monarchies to survive the First World War.
and one of the most extraordinary objects at Windsor captures that moment of continuity.
more than 1, 000 of Britain's finest artists and craftsmen created Queen Mary's Dolls' House.
it celebrated, in miniature, a very British way of life.
one of my favourite rooms in the house is actually the wonderful King's Library, here.
look at all the books! I know - aren't they wonderful?
all the contemporary authors of the day in Britain contributed a book to the library.
and it's an absolutely astonishing record of the 1920s, of that period, of what was being done in literature.
and is each book really a book?
absolutely, yes.
I can show you the inside of a printed book, and you can see...
the Tempest...look at that!
Yes, this is a little copy of one of the volumes of Shakespeare.
incredible!
so they were all especially bound for the Dolls' House.
what about the furniture?
is that all made by the finest craftsmen of the time as well?
Yes, and every single piece is made so beautifully and with incredible amount of detail.
so if you open a drawer on a piece of furniture, you'll see that every piece has been dovetailed properly, and everything works.
can we open a drawer?
I'll, um...try and give it a go.
I've put you on the spot now.
right, that's...
Oh, look at that! And then all the things inside!
there's the King's stationery inside.
and on top of here, you can see the despatch boxes, which were made for George V.
what's that - "The King..."?
that says, "The King," and then his royal cipher on top. Lord Chancellor.
Yes.
and the clocks, are they real clocks? Yes, yes.
and they were made by Cartier. They do actually work.
and the guns, look at those!
I know, those were some of King George V's favourite objects.
the first time the Dolls' House was seen by the public was at the Empire Exhibition in 1924.
and that was to showcase British manufacturing at its best, wasn't it? Absolutely, yes.
the Dolls' House is an evocative glimpse of a moment in time.
everything in it represents royal daily life exactly as it was in the early 1920s.
one of the things that's interesting about the house is it's a real snapshot of life both above stairs and below stairs.
Ooh, I love looking at downstairs.
Yes, this is the wonderful kitchen.
and what have we got here? Look, Colman's mustard. Yes, yes.
and look at all the copper pots and pans.
Yes, it was all perfectly made.
and I just wanted to show you the kettle, this is rather fun, because it was actually...
you can see, if you turn it over, it was made from a penny, and you can still see the King's head.
Oh, yes, there he is.
his ear, the most prominent bit.
incredible. And what about all the plates here?
Yes, they all have a K on, so they were clearly for kitchen use, not for upstairs.
lest anyone commit the terrible faux pas of taking them above stairs. That's right.
and do you know what I really love as well, is the perfect...
locks on the doors and the little brass light switches.
I know, and they're in each room.
again, this shows the exact attention to detail.
and not only is the house electrically wired throughout, it even has its own fully functioning plumbing!
of course, although this is in many ways just a country house, it is obviously a royal house, and we've got the crown jewels here in the little strongroom.
there we are, complete replicas of the crown jewels
they've got real diamonds and real rubies.
Really? Absolutely extraordinary. We have got the orbs and sceptre, and they're gold, presumably.
Yes, absolutely, all supplied again by the crown jewellers, Garrard's.
and even the Prince of Wales' crown, coronet, is at the front there.
how exquisite.
now a final surprise.
you may not know this, there's a garden to this house, it's hidden away at the moment. Where is it? Perhaps you'd like a look.
I would. If I ask you to put these gloves on, then we can open it up.
where is it, then? It's just in this drawer down here.
Oh, I see.
how fascinating.
so if you take this, it's quite heavy.
right. We need to pull it out as far as it'll go.
there we go. Ooh, gosh, you weren't kidding.
keep going, keep going? Keep going.
and if you just gently pull the balustrade... You sure?
..it should just open up, there we go.
Ah, wow, look at that! And there's the garden.
isn't it wonderful?
just wonderful.
and then here, garden implements.
Yes, and even a baby's pram for the little... The royal offspring?
the royal offspring. Again, the detail is astonishing.
fantastic - old lawnmower there.
and all hidden away.
how ingenious!
but Windsor Castle and all its treasures would face their darkest hour on Friday 20th November 1992.
fire has swept through Windsor Castle 'and it's still burning, and this is the scene from Windsor tonight.'
150 firemen have been battling the blaze, 'which has caused millions of pounds' worth of damage.'
the fire apparently started in the private chapel, 'on the first floor of the northeast wing of the castle.'
as fire raged through the State apartments, suddenly it looked as if this historic building and all its contents might be lost forever.
everyone in the castle fought to save what they could.
the then Director of the Royal Collection, Sir Hugh Roberts, 'was part of the rescue operation.'
on the day of the fire, the afternoon of the fire,
I came into the end of this room here, and you could hear the noise of the fire coming through at roof level. How terrifying.
it was, and the fire brigade, who were absolutely fantastic, marvellous over fighting the fire, said that this room would go, so would the next-door room, and there was no way of stopping it.
the fire brought the whole ceiling down and brought everything else with it, including, of course, this chandelier, which we'd only just put back up after it had been rewired.
and that was buried under a huge mound of debris.
and the room was really burnt right back to the brick and to the stone and just open to the sky.
so what happened in terms of the process of restoring this room?
the decision was taken, I think and hope rightly, to put it back as it was and to follow the original designs.
and this was George IV's designs? These were George IV's designs, yes.
when this was burnt down, the fabrics for example had been put there in the '20s by Queen Mary?
queen Mary, yes. Yes, well, we've got that here, in fact, a piece of it which survives.
it's a pattern called Torcello, and it's, as you can see, a huge pattern and actually really in many ways too big for the room.
and we had this marvellous drawing from the 1820s, which was done for King George IV.
and we could see what the original design more or less was, which was able to be copied for the walls and for the seat coverings.
and of course, these drawings were all shown to George IV for him to approve.
and as you can see, he approved it. Oh, yes, he signed it there.
so his attention to detail was incredible, then. Yes.
now, at the time, when George IV created this room, it was...
it was beyond extravagant, it was phenomenally extravagant.
obviously in '92, rather different times, so it had to be done presumably with an eye to the budget?
Yes, I mean I think the view was that we should try and restore something of the magnificence that George IV was...
attempting to do but without really spending quite the amount of money that he thought was normal.
without bankrupting the nation!
today, thanks to a team of specialist restorers, you'd never know there'd been such a catastrophe.
the fire also led to some surprising discoveries.
this is the oldest working kitchen in the country.
now, at first glance, it looks like a very impressive but modern standard industrial kitchen.
but then look up and you'll see something quite different
the original medieval timbered ceiling.
the ancient timbers were only revealed when layers of later alterations were stripped away by the fire.
one of Windsor's grandest rooms did not fare so well.
it was decided, instead of recreating it exactly the way it was, this would be an opportunity for fresh invention.
this is St George's Hall, right by where the fire started, and it was completely destroyed.
it was decided that craftsmen should try to recapture the medieval spirit of the hall but with a twist.
the magnificent oak ceiling may seem like it's been here for centuries, but the hammerbeam design is entirely new, created to replace a rather plain, flat roof.
what is faithful to the original, though, is all these heraldic shields on the ceiling, each one representing a Knight of the Garter.
and every one has been painstakingly repainted.
but if you spot the odd white one, that's not cos they haven't got round to it yet
it represents a knight whose colours were removed, because he brought dishonour upon the Order.
no building in British history can lay claim to have reinvented itself so often and so effectively.
that's what makes it unique among Britain's great buildings.
when I look at Windsor now, I don't just see a castle.
with its many layers, its years of glory and of neglect, its bits added on, knocked down, embellished, restored,
Windsor is the story of the last 1, 000 years of our nation.
the most ambitious map in history is taking shape before our eyes.
and scientists are heading\nfor the edge.
it may be the strangest map\nyou'll ever see.
and it's bigger\nthan you can believe.
it's a map of the entire universe.
there's this whole pattern to the\nuniverse we're starting to map out.
seeing it really brought home the\nway the universe actually behaved, in a way that all the numbers\nand equations never quite could.
cosmologists are making sense\nof startling discoveries.
medieval maps would say,\n"Here be monsters.
they weren't entirely wrong.
they're even building pictures\nof the invisible.
how do you map something\nthat you can't even see?
our brains build maps even\nwhere our telescopes cannot reach.
this is a map of everything we know.
and it's getting bigger every day.
it kind of hits you,\nhow magnificent it is.
it's bigger than\nwe can actually really even imagine.
the universe is so big, we may never find the edge.
mapping the universe\nis a job for pioneers.
Nick Risinger is blazing a trail\nthrough the American south west.
you have to be pretty persistent.
no stopping.
you've got to keep going.
Nick wants to put our entire galaxy\non the map.
he's on a single-handed mission, to photograph the Milky Way.
new Mexico is a great place\nto take photos.
it's dry, it's high, and there's not a whole lot of\ncity around here.
there's a break in the weather, and you get a full,\nalmost a full night in.
other times, you only get,\nyou know, 10% of the night.
but it's all luck of the draw.
it's looking pretty good\nover there, actually.
in the modern world, few of us have skies dark enough\nto see the Milky Way.
but Nick plans to show us\nour home galaxy like we've never seen it before.
I'm trying to give people that broad,\nbig-picture understanding of the entire night sky,\nand where they fit into that.
our galaxy has nearly\nhalf a trillion stars.
most of them are too dim\nand distant to see.
but Nick's cameras are more than 2, 000 times more\nsensitive than the naked eye.
if I had known how much work\nit would be going into it,
I probably wouldn't have\neven started.
but my personality is, once you\nstart something, you finish it.
after two years, he's photographed\n20 million stars...
.by stitching together\nmore than 37, 000 separate images.
some people might be driven crazy by hearing shutters clack\nall night long.
but it's actually music to my ears,\nbecause it means they're working.
by combining data from\nsix different cameras, he's captured something that would tax even the world's most powerful telescopes.
his final image is the highest\ndefinition, true colour map ever made of the Milky Way.
but he hasn't just mapped it...
.He's made a hand-held\nguide to the galaxy.
this is like a window to the sky.
and you can point it\nin any direction and be shown exactly\nwhat you're looking at.
so here, we're looking at\nthe centre of our galaxy.
this is our Milky Way.
you can see this bright cluster\nof many small stars.
the map reveals more features\nwith every level of detail.
as we zoom in here\nto the centre of the galaxy,
I'll point out this dark patch here,\nthis is the Pipe Nebula, and it's one of my favourite\nlandmarks to help me orient myself.
but it's the sheer size of the image\nthat reveals its true ambition.
from one side to the other,\nit's 100, 000 light years.
this image is such a big subject, and it makes you feel so small.
100, 000 light years!
it boggles the mind just trying\nto comprehend just how vast that is.
but the fact is, the map\nof the universe has barely begun.
Anthony Aguirre, from the University\nof California in Santa Cruz, is a theoretical cosmologist.
so he's used to thinking big.
now to say that we're going to go\nout and make a map of the universe, it almost sounds crazy.
it sounds like real hubris, right?
we're going to go\nand map the universe!
and yet the universe, as it turns\nout, is really amenable to mapping.
but you have to think big,\nand clever.
and that's where\nthe balloons come in.
because the map of the universe\nisn't like other maps.
we have to think in a different way, we can't just go out and look at the\nuniverse and draw things on paper and say,\n"There's our map of the universe.
the universe is so big that the laws of physics say\nwe can't see all of it.
it's as if we're at the centre of a\ngiant balloon, and we can't see out.
we can only see light.
and light moves at a certain speed.
and so, as we look\nfarther and farther away, we're looking farther and farther\nback in time because we're seeing light\ncoming to us from long ago.
but there's only so far\nwe can go back in time.
so there's only so far we can see.
it's called\nthe "observable universe."
we can only map what's inside, because the universe is\nonly 13. 7 billion years old.
there may well be\na lot more universe outside, but the light hasn't had time\nto reach us yet.
in the last 20 years, we've seen\nthis tremendous expansion, both in the amount and in the\nprecision of knowledge that we have about the observable universe.
this has allowed cosmologists to\nmake a map of unbelievable scale.
the Milky Way could fit inside\n10 million million million times.
our entire galaxy's\njust a dot on the landscape.
in the observable universe, there are 170 billion galaxies\njust like it.
Janna Levin is a professor\nof theoretical astrophysics.
she'd like to put every single\ngalaxy we can see on the map.
but, before she can do that,\nit's vital to account for one of the most surprising features\nof the universe.
making a map of the whole universe is not like mapping\na map of the United States.
it's an observational fact that, if\nyou look at the galaxies around us, and the most distant\ngalaxies that we can see, they all appear to be moving away\nfrom us.
and, the further away they are, the\nfaster they're moving away from us.
the galaxies aren't\nlike landmarks on normal maps.
they don't stand still.
everywhere we look, the most distant\ngalaxies are moving away from us.
this a strange universe, and the explanation\nis even stranger.
people want to imagine\na central point with everything exploding out\nfrom that point, moving away only from that\none central location.
that's really\nthe wrong picture here.
that makes it sound like\nwe're in a special place, like somehow we're at the centre, and\neverything is moving away from us.
but actually it's not like that.
there's nothing special\nabout our place in the universe.
if we went to another galaxy, we'd see exactly the same thing.
if you went to a distant galaxy, they would have\nthe same perspective.
they would look at\nall the galaxies around them and see that they were moving away.
you really have to try to imagine that every single point is\nmoving away from every other point.
so no point is special.
no matter where you're standing\nin the universe, if you look out, you will see\ngalaxies moving away from you.
think of it like cities\non the map of America.
if you were standing in California, you would see New York\nmoving away from you.
but, from the perspective\nof New York, you would see Boston move away.
and if you were standing in Chicago, you would see New York\nand California moving away from you.
so, no matter where you're standing, you see everything else\nmoving away from you.
in the observable universe, the galaxies are doing\nexactly the same thing.
the only explanation for that is that the space itself is stretching, that the universe itself\nis getting bigger, not that the galaxies\nare moving on the space, but that the space\nis getting bigger.
it's as if the whole of America was\ngetting bigger and bigger every day.
you'd think it would be impossible to keep the map up to date.
but cosmologists take\neverything into account, by using careful measurements\nof the expansion rate.
it works like the scale factor\non any road map.
imagine the United States\nis doubling every day.
you wouldn't want to make\na new map every day, you wouldn't draw a new map.
all you would have to do really\nis change the legend.
instead of one mile\nbetween tick marks, the next day would be two miles,\nthe next day would be four miles.
and that scale, changing\non the side in your legend, would completely account for the\nfact that the States kept doubling.
and so you could keep\nyour originally drawn map.
the map of the observable universe\ndoesn't change except for the scale factor.
right now, it's 46 billion\nlight years to the edge.
but it's growing all the time.
so, while, at first,\nthis is a little confusing, trying to imagine something\nlike a universe expanding, we realise that,\nby drawing a simple map and by changing the scale\non that map, that we can handle the expansion\nactually quite simply.
for cosmologists, the expansion\nof the universe is not a problem.
in fact, it's a gift.
if space is stretching, then the wavelength of light\nfrom the galaxies is stretching too.
the greater the distance,\nthe redder the light.
this red shift effect is the mapmaker's vital tool\nfor measuring distance.
and red shift was the key\nto the next vital stage in mapping the universe.
a survey to pinpoint\nthe exact location of galaxies, stretching 5. 5 billion light years\nfrom Earth.
it started here, in one of the\nmore unusual towns in America.
welcome to Cloudcroft, New Mexico.
a place where you don't have to be\nan astronomer to map the universe.
everyone in town can have a piece\nof the action.
to us, it's wonderful - I mean,\nit's just part of our everyday life.
on a clear night,\nmy husband will say, "Well, you're going\nto be busy tomorrow!
Frances Cope has been working here\nfor two-and-a-half years.
the last count, she'd mapped\na quarter of a million galaxies.
it can be very therapeutic, but mostly it's, to me personally, it's a sense of fulfilment.
Tracey Naugle\ntrained as a mechanic, then retrained\nin galactic exploration.
it's neat that you are a part of\ndiscovering new galaxies, it's kind of a good feeling.
Kristina Huehnerhoff\nis a freelance writer.
mapping the universe\nhelps her wind down.
it's very Zen, I think,\nbecause you're, you know, you're putting things\nwhere they're supposed to be.
they all work with this man.
david Schlegel is a cosmologist from the University of California\nat Berkeley.
when he first came to town, the map of the universe\nwas almost empty.
the only pictures we had of the full\nsky were on photographic plates, images taken by Palomar Sky Survey\nin the 1950s.
and actually we were\nstill using that in the 1990s, that was the best picture that we had\nof the full sky.
the Palomar Survey was\npractically a museum piece
photographed on\nfragile glass negatives.
even by 1998, only 30, 000 galaxies had been\nplaced on the map of the universe.
that's when David\njoined the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at the nearby\nApache Point Observatory.
we had the sense that it was going to be this great thing that was starting, but it hadn't\nactually started yet.
what we wanted to do was something\nmuch more ambitious and actually get a map of the million\nbrightest galaxies on the sky.
the task required measuring the\ndistance, and therefore red shift, for every single one\nof these galaxies.
obviously you need to look\nat more than one galaxy at a time, so that's the trick.
if you were a futurist you'd say, "Well, it's the 1990s, we have\ncomputers and we have robots.
the folks designing the Sloan,\nthough, decided to take\nthe pragmatic approach and say, well, we actually want\nthis thing to work.
instead of robots, the ingenious\nsystem they came up with required a far more human touch.
and they would have to go round\nthe universe not once, but twice.
it's really doing\ntwo maps of the sky.
the first time round, they didn't\nmeasure any red shifts.
the telescope\nsimply took photographs...
a map of the sky,\nbut in two dimensions only.
it doesn't give the distance\nto each galaxy - yet.
we actually have from\nthose images not very much idea of where these things are\nin three dimensional space.
so at some level,\nit's just a pretty picture.
but the next stage was the trick.
they printed the pretty pictures\nin metal.
each of these holes corresponds to our two dimensional location of a galaxy on the sky, where if I look at this hole, we have the longitude\non this coordinate, the latitude in this coordinate, and so the whole design of this system is to as efficiently\nas possible get the light from that one galaxy\ninto that specific hole.
the plugging team from town\nconnected every galaxy with a fibre optic cable...
.then fitted the plate\nback over the telescope.
second time around, the telescope\nmeasures the red shifts for these specific galaxies alone.
1, 000 galaxies on a plate, nine plates a night and one million galaxies in total on a map crafted by human hands.
it's hard to wrap my head around\nthe idea that we're looking at...
you know, with 1, 000 fibres,\nwe're looking at 1, 000 galaxies, and it's... I have a hard time\nwrapping my head around that the universe is that big.
the Sloan Survey is one of the great\nachievements of Precision Cosmology.
red shift measures the distance
the third and final co-ordinate\nfor every galaxy...
.To make a 3D Movie\non a colossal scale.
maybe you've seen things like this\nin the opening of Star Trek or Star Wars or whatever,\nand that all looks great, but it's not real.
this movie -\nit is the real Universe.
every point of light on the map is a galaxy like the Milky Way.
cosmologists can now see at a glance how the galaxies\nare arranged in space.
what these maps let us do, is it really allows us to test all\nthe forces of nature we know about.
there is structure,\nreally, on all scales.
the galaxies are not just\nplaced at random
they're bound together by gravity,\nin a vast cosmic web.
this goes on and on, and\nin fact up to the largest scales that we can see.
you can still trace\nthese structures of galaxies.
but the most surprising discovery\nis what can't be seen.
most of the universe is missing.
the gravity, due to the stuff that\nwe see, due to say the galaxies and stars, can't do the job.
it's simply not enough stuff to\narrange things into the patterns that we see, have galaxies spinning\nin the way that they do.
there's something else there.
there's something beyond the galaxies that we see,\nthe visible matter.
there's some sort of\nDark Matter out there.
modern cosmology\nneeds a new kind of map maker.
because most of the universe\nis hiding in the dark.
we don't know what Dark Matter is because it's never been detected\non Earth.
we know it must be out there, because its gravity is holding the\ncosmic web of galaxies together.
but we can't see it, because it\ndoesn't give off light.
someone has to find it and put it on the map.
british astronomer Richard Massey is\na master of the invisible.
he's a member of a team\nhunting for Dark Matter, based at the California\nInstitute of Technology.
so, he's a frequent flyer\nto the city of Los Angeles.
when you're flying over\nAmerica at night, you see these criss-crossing lanes\nof street lights spread out across the continent.
there's obviously some interesting\nstories going on down there, in between these roads.
in fact, most of the story\nof what's going on in America is actually happening in those\nempty spaces that you can't see.
Richard's task is like mapping\nthose apparently empty spaces.
it's as if whole cities\nwere hiding in the dark.
if we're driving across America, and\ntrying to map out a new frontier, we can see mountains and valleys and streams and we can draw\nthem all on a map.
but when we're trying to map out\nthe universe, most of its contents are invisible.
it takes imagination to find your\nway in a Dark Universe.
you have to dream up new ways\nto detect what can't be seen.
one possibility is that if\nDark Matter doesn't give off light maybe it absorbs light.
ordinary matter, the stuff that\nwe're made out of, casts a shadow
because it absorbs light.
so we can see the ordinary matter\nin silhouette.
unfortunately, Dark Matter doesn't\ngive itself away that easily.
light just goes straight through it.
dark Matter doesn't interact\nwith light in any way, so we can't look for its silhouette\nto map out where it is.
we have to be a bit more\ningenious about it.
the solution depends on\na very simple idea.
it's like looking at lights in\na swimming pool.
the secret to mapping Dark Matter\nthat you can't see, is to look at the light\nthat you can see.
everything that has mass,\nincluding Dark Matter, actually bends the fabric of space\nand time that we're that we live in.
and if space is warped, then\neverything in it is distorted.
even the paths of light rays.
the only way that Dark Matter might\nreveal itself is through gravity.
according to Einstein's\nTheory of Relativity, all matter distorts space causing\nlight to change direction.
the idea of General Relativity\nbending space and time and deflecting rays of\nlight sounds complicated.
but actually you see light rays\nbending all the time.
when you Look into a swimming pool and see\nyour legs aren't in the right shape, you know that there must be\nsome water in the way.
the distortion of the lights depends\non water ripples in the pool.
which in turn depend on where\nthe swimmers are at any one moment.
this is great, we're seeing these\ndistorted images of lights under the pool and by looking at\nthe shapes of these, we can work out what the ripples\nin the water are doing.
the survey team went looking\nfor Dark Matter in exactly the same way...
.with 1, 000 hours of observations\non the Hubble Space Telescope.
by looking at distant galaxies\nhalfway across the universe, by looking at their shapes and the distorted images\nthat we see of those, we can work out what ripples there\nare in space between them and us.
and those ripples in space\nare caused by the Dark Matter.
the search zone was a thin column\nof the universe, stretching eight billion\nlight years from Earth.
the team were on the look-out for distortions\nin the most distant galaxies.
whenever you see galaxies distorted into these strange\nuncharacteristic shapes, you know that there must be\nsomething in between them and you, something really massive,\nand even if it's invisible, you can still map out where it is by\nthe way it warps that space time.
the mapping technique revealed\na ghostly, hidden universe.
the light from visible galaxies was\nrecast in new and beautiful forms.
they've become these full rings, distorted just like what are known as\nEinstein Rings, whenever there's a big lump\nof Dark Matter in front of them.
the lumps become contours on a map\nof the invisible.
they reveal Dark Matter\nas the hidden iceberg beneath the surface\nof the cosmic ocean.
what we're finding out there\nin the universe is really weird.
it's equivalent to the idea that only\none out of six cities in America actually has any people living in it.
the other five sixths\nof the population are these invisible ghosts\nthat we just can't see.
the survey has\ntransformed the map of the universe.
it suggests that normal,\nvisible matter is just a fraction\nof what's out there.
in the search zone, Dark Matter\noutweighs it by six to one.
this is the stuff the universe\nis really made of.
for cosmologists, the road ahead\nhas become a lot less certain.
right now, we know the\nuniverse is expanding.
but given enough Dark Matter, it could have a different, and very dark future.
it's sensible to conclude, when we look at how that stuff\naffects the shape of space, that the universe should be expanding but that it should be slowing down.
dark Matter puts a very heavy\nfoot on the brakes.
because the more matter there is,\nthe more gravity there is.
gravity attracts.
and so the cosmic\nexpansion should be slowed down by all that attraction.
if there's enough Dark Matter, the universe will eventually stop\nexpanding altogether...
.and go into reverse.
gravity will bring everything\nback together, in a final, cataclysmic big crunch.
the question is - when?
the search for the answer began here on the Berkeley Campus of the\nUniversity of California.
it's a distinctive outpost in the\nlandscape of science signposted with some\nof its greatest names.
there's even a car park\nreserved for Nobel Laureates.
nine prize winners in a row - with five in Physics alone.
and it was here, in 1988,\nthat Saul Perlmutter set out to map the\ndeceleration of the universe.
there's nothing you like more\nthan a really good mystery.
I wondered if you could\nactually measure, how much the universe\nwas slowing down.
I thought it was a very exciting\npossibility that you could, make a measurement, and find out\nwhat the fate of the universe was.
saul was the leading light behind an international team of\nphysicists and astronomers.
under his guidance, they embarked on\na ten year voyage of exploration far across the observable universe.
the key was to measure how fast the\nuniverse was expanding in the past, compared to now.
They\nplanned to map ancient galaxies
10. 8 billion light years from Earth.
but it would take a\nwhole decade to find and analyse what they were looking for.
a candle.
if you want to measure distances\nacross the universe you would like to be able to use an\nobject that's of known brightness.
we call anything that we know the\nbrightness of a Standard Candle.
a Standard Candle always has the\nsame brightness
so you can use it to\nmeasure distance very precisely.
the further away it is, the dimmer it will appear\nin our telescopes.
but candles are elusive objects.
we hunt, for what astronomical\nobject could you possibly use, that will behave\nin this very regular way, so that you can actually\ncompare the distances.
the galaxies themselves are no good.
they come in many\ndifferent shapes and sizes and at this distance, they're so dim\nwe can barely see them.
we're talking about distances that\nare even more vast than usual for astronomy.
now we need to look\nat some of the most distant objects in the universe.
so these had to be\nvery bright objects.
saul had a very bright idea.
he would find his way by the light\nof a dying star.
a supernova.
when one of\nthese supernovas explode, that one star can be as bright as the entire galaxy of a hundred billion other stars.
so this is a remarkably\nbright, single event.
saul had a special kind\nof supernova in mind.
a Type 1A is triggered when a dying star draws in mass\nfrom its neighbour.
just at the point where\nthere's a critical mass, there will be a runaway\nthermonuclear explosion.
so that means that it's triggered at\nthe same mass every time.
same mass every time\nmeans same brightness every time.
they're perfect standard candles.
but Saul had to find them first.
if you could work\nwith anything else in the world besides a supernova\nto do your research you would, they're just a real\npain in the neck to work with.
they're rare, they're random\nand they're rapid.
a supernova only burns\nbrightly for three weeks.
and in any given galaxy, they explode without warning roughly once every 300 years.
with those odds, you can't book\nvaluable time on the world's best telescopes.
it makes a terrible proposal,\nif you were to say that, "Sometime in the next\nseveral hundred years, "a Type 1a supernova, might explode,\nsomewhere in this galaxy.
I would like the night\nof March the 3rd, just in case.
but Saul had a plan to get the odds\nworking in his favour.
with billions of galaxies\nin the observable universe
there are dozens of supernovae\nevery night.
saul's team spent six years perfecting a new system\nfor supernovae on demand.
they took snapshots\nof thousands of galaxies at once, then repeated them\ntwo and a half weeks later.
first you don't see a supernova.
now you do.
that's very important,\nthat two and a half weeks, because that guarantees,\nthat everything you find,\nthat's brighter, on the second night than the first,\nis on the way up.
we can now guarantee\nthat there would not just be one
type 1A supernova,\nbut there would be a half dozen.
saul now knew exactly where to point one of the world's\nmost powerful telescopes
the Keck Observatory in Hawaii.
he was finally ready to measure\nthe deceleration of the universe.
but by late in 1997, the team was getting\nsome very weird results.
the points were not showing up\nwhere you would expect.
this was exciting.
the supernovae distance measurements didn't match\nthe predicted deceleration.
we were then faced with\nthe question, "OK, what else\ncould be going wrong?
saul and his team spent five more\nanxious months, eliminating all possible\nsources of error.
but by January 1998 they were\nfinally ready to go public.
the more we checked, the more we, fine tuned every little\nstep of the calibration, the more the weird result\ndidn't go away.
the weird result\nhas reverberated through the world of science ever since.
in January 2012,
saul Perlmutter won\nthe Nobel Prize for Physics and booked a parking space for life.
at the end, we concluded that\nactually, the universe really\nisn't slowing down, it's actually speeding up\nin its expansion.
and that was a big shock.
it's been described as one of the\nbiggest shocks in modern cosmology.
this is a Runaway Universe and everyone's on board
whether we like it or not.
we find out that the universe\nis not just expanding, but that it's getting\nfaster and faster.
the cosmological community,\nwhen this result came out, was completely incredulous.
I didn't believe it\nwhen I first heard about it.
I don't even think I paid very much\nattention to it at the time.
we know the universe\ndoesn't look like this.
there had to be something wrong\nwith these observations.
I thought they would go away,\nI really did.
of course, I was wrong.
it's sometimes really fun\nto be wrong.
welcome to a very new picture\nof the universe.
but even the experts can hardly\nbelieve it's real.
the most famous force in physics\nhas met its match
because the entire universe\nis defying gravity.
this was saying that\nthere was something that fills the universe, and causes an anti-gravity force.
something that was causing everything\nto push everything else apart, and to make the universe\nbigger and bigger in an accelerated way.
gravity acts as a brake
pulling back on the expansion\nof the universe.
but we now know there's another more mysterious force
with its foot on the gas.
what's doing the pushing?
what's that force that's forcing\neverything apart?
well, we don't know, but we did work out what to call it.
we have a name for it.\nWe call it dark energy.
cosmologists don't know\nwhat dark energy is.
they only know what it does.
where gravity pulls
dark energy pushes.
you don't see this stuff.
you don't see it doing anything,\ndirectly.
Basically,\nit's sort of this one hit wonder, that just does one thing,\nit causes an anti-gravity force.
we don't have any other\nhandle on it.
dark energy is dark matter's\ndark adversary.
a shadow on the entire universe.
there's dark energy in the galaxy.
there's dark energy, here on Earth.
there's dark energy passing\nthrough us right now.
we're filled with this dark energy.
we don't see it - we don't feel it.
but it's everywhere.
it's kind of just a uniform\ncolouration to our map.
73% of the universe is dark energy, but you'd never know.
on everyday life,\nthis stuff is just hard to detect.
now, it's true\nthat between my two fingers, there's an anti-gravity force,\nright now.
but that anti-gravity force\nis so incredibly minuscule, that I'll never ever notice it.
it's only when you get\nto really large scales, that you really see\nthe affect of this stuff.
if I could move my fingers,\nall the way across the universe, then they'd feel this tremendous push\napart, due to this dark energy.
in the really big scheme of things, dark matter is fighting\na losing battle...
.because there's only\nso much of it to go round.
if you add more space, if you give more place for those\nlittle pieces of matter to be, then, the density of them goes down.
you just see less of it -\nit gets diluted.
as the universe expands,\ndark matter thins out until it can no longer compete\nwith dark energy.
the really crucial thing about how\nthis dark energy behaves, is that it doesn't dilute.
when the universe doubles in size, you've got twice as much\ndark energy.
you make it four times as big,\nyou've just got four times as much\ndark energy.
once you get to this\ncosmological scale, the biggest possible scale, it becomes the biggest game in town.
it becomes the prime player.
dark energy is on the map.
but cosmologists can't explain it.
depressing, or exciting?\nI think it's exciting.
as a map maker,\nthis is a strange thing.
we go out, we make this map, we discover this land, we've mapped it out, and we still don't know what it is.
I love that.
the entire observable universe\nis saturated in dark energy.
but there's one final set of clues\nto be found
on its furthest edge.
and it may contain the secrets\nto the universe beyond.
we're heading off the map\ninto impossible territory.
the edge of the observable universe is the furthest horizon\nour telescopes can see.
but for cosmologists like\nSean Carroll, that's not enough.
he wants to know\nthe size of the whole universe.
I definitely think it's OK to think\nabout parts of the universe that we\ncan't observe and can never observe.
we've done a very good\njob at understanding what the universe looks like\nin that visible portion.
so now when our imaginations roam, they often sneak outside the visible\nportion to ask what might the universe look like\nbeyond our visible horizon.
the universe that we can't see
that's the playground\nfor theorists now.
but if we can't see the rest\nof the universe, how can we figure out how big it is?
for Janna Levin, it's a similar task\nto working out the shape and size of the earth.
but there's a catch.
we know we could step far from\nthe Earth, as an astronaut has.
we can look down on it and see from the outside that it was\na sphere and it was curved.
you can't step\noutside of the universe.
you have to do\neverything from inside of space.
without leaving the earth, how do you know it's round, and therefore has finite size?
it could be completely flat, and stretch to infinity\nin all directions.
one way is to use a simple\npiece of mathematics.
all you have to do\nis draw a triangle.
if you're drawing a small enough\ntriangle on the beach, you won't notice\nthe curvature of the earth.
it will look like a normal triangle, you'll be able to draw the lines\npretty straight and the interior angles will look\nlike they add up to 180 degrees, it will look like the triangle you\ndraw on a flat sheet of paper.
but this isn't a normal triangle, because the earth's surface\nis curved.
it's just so subtle, that the sides of the triangles\nstill look straight.
it would probably be a challenge on\nthe beach to draw it big enough that you would be able to\nnotice the curvature of the earth.
the key is to make the curvature\nmore obvious
by drawing the biggest triangle\nyou can.
if I draw a triangle big enough that it comes from the North Pole and it wraps all the way\naround North America, now it's very obvious that those\nangles are bigger than 180 degrees and that the sides of the triangle\nare not straight lines.
so, we can show the earth is curved and therefore has finite size\nwithout leaving it.
and we can find out the shape\nand size of the universe\nin exactly the same way
by looking for triangles of light.
light will travel in a straight line\nif the space is flat, and light itself will travel\nin an arc if the space is curved.
these curves are going to be\nso subtle, more subtle than\nthe curvature of the earth.
we really have to look back as far as we possibly can.
and that means the oldest relic\nwe have in the universe.
so that means looking at things like the light left\nover from the Big Bang.
the early universe was a hot,\ndense fireball.
when it cooled,\na pattern of light emerged at what is now the edge\nof the observable universe.
this is the cosmic\nmicrowave background.
the CMB was discovered in the 1960s.
but throughout his career,\nSean Carroll has been able to explore it\nin greater and greater detail
waiting for triangles to emerge.
it takes good technology to do it, you need better and better\nreceivers, less and less noise\nin your detector, and ultimately you need satellites to get a really good 360 degree view of the whole\ncosmic microwave background.
it was NASA's WMAP mission in 2003
that brought the most vital contours\ninto sharp focus.
wmap for the first time\nhad that resolution so when WMAP came out, we could\nreally use those features to make a big triangle and measure\nthe geometry of space.
continents begin to appear,\nsmaller islands, you get a finer resolution\nof the coastlines and so forth.
the islands are miniscule\ntemperature variations in the early universe
less than 100, 000th of a degree...
.a distinctive feature\nfor making triangles.
these splotches we see\nin the microwave background\nappear at all different sizes but there is a best size\nfor them to be, there's a size at which the\nfluctuations are the strongest.
we know how big they are, we know how far away they are, so between us and the size\nof a feature in the CMB, we can measure a triangle and use\nthat to infer the geometry of space.
the earth, plus the opposite\nsides of the island, form the three points of a very\nlong, thin triangle
the key to measuring whether\nthe universe is flat or curved.
if the universe were\npositively curved, if the angles inside the triangle\nadded up to greater than 180 degrees, then it would be finite in size.
if the spatial geometry is flat, if the angles inside the triangle\nadd up to 180, then it could go on for ever.
the result is one of the greatest\ntriumphs of modern cosmology.
a miracle of precision map making that measures the angles of the\ntriangle to the third decimal place.
and it says that the\nuniverse is infinite.
the answer is that Euclid was right, space seems to us to be flat\nas far as we can measure it.
that means that the simplest\npicture of the universe, is a universe that's infinite.
we really could\nlive in a universe where, there's galaxy after galaxy\nafter galaxy, in every direction.
up, down, sideways.\nAnd, it never stops.
cosmologists have found a way to picture the universe\nin its entirety
confirmation of the tremendous\npower of making maps.
it will never cease to amaze me
we human beings here on this tiny\nlittle rock are able to reach out with our instruments and our brains to understand the whole shebang.
and if an infinite universe\nisn't big enough for you
then Saul Perlmutter has proved\nit's still growing.
all the distances are getting\nbigger, every day.
so, it's still infinite,\nall the same galaxies are there, it's just that we have\npumped more space between every point\nin this infinite universe.
that's really mind boggling.
but even this isn't\nthe end of the story.
there may be one final,\nbizarre twist in the road.
because Anthony Aguirre thinks\nour universe may not be alone.
sometimes when I'm headed down\nthe highway and I'm driving, you know, my wife will say, "Anthony, you're going 40\non the highway.
and then she knows that I'm thinking\nabout other universes.
he thinks there may be\nother universes because of the process\nthat created our own.
it's called inflation.
it describes an exponential\nexpansion in the moments after the Big Bang, at a speed the universe would\nnever repeat again.
inflation has been a very successful\ntheory in predicting observed properties of our universe and how our observed universe\ncame into being.
inflation may have started\nout as a mathematical theory, but it has gained acceptance\nafter successful testing against the evidence from the\ncosmic microwave background.
I was amazed when I saw the results\ncome in from those satellites that reproduced all the bumps\nand wiggles and all the detailed properties\nof that microwave background that inflation had predicted.
inflation explains how the\nobservable universe developed.
it was doubling in size over and\nover again in a tiny fraction\nof a second, going from something like a billionth\nof the size of a proton to something maybe the size of a\nbubble, a soap bubble.
but inflation didn't stop\nwith our own universe.
Anthony believes it may have\nhappened over and over again.
this is really a side effect.
it's a huge side effect,\nit's an amazing side effect, but it's a side effect of something\nwe invented already for a different\npurpose.
it's a process called\neternal inflation.
there could be as many\nas we can imagine.
Anthony's vision - of an infinite\nnumber of infinite universes
may sound far-fetched.
but the search is on to find\nevidence to support it.
evidence from the oldest\npart of our map.
every once in a while we could have\nsort of a cosmic collision with another bubble.
it would leave an impact, it would\nleave a bruise, a disc in the sky on the microwave background radiation\nthat we could look for.
Anthony and his colleagues\nhave simulated what a collision of universes\nwould look like.
a dark bruise, superimposed\non the cosmic microwave background.
he doesn't yet have enough\ndata to test it, but it's a tantalising\nglimpse of what the map could reveal with the next\ngeneration of satellites.
in principle I think this scenario\nwith all these bubbles is testable, we can actually go out\nand look for them.
this may be the ultimate\nmap of the universe.
we're talking about understanding\nand testing and theorising in a scientific way about an\ninfinite number of universes.
it's simultaneously so mind-boggling and yet it's still rigorous science
we can do mathematics, we can do\nexperiments, we can really test it.
some day we'll understand\nthe universe so well that we can literally take that map,\n put it on a little compact disc and put it in our pockets\nand take it home.
OK, sorry. Bye.
hello.
Yup. BBC? Yes, I know. ...You want me to what?
you want me to go round the world?
Yeah, but why? You can go Round the world in 36 hours.
Ah... 80.
80 days, yes.
Oh, I see, and I'd be... I'd be Phileas Fogg.
and we follow the Jules Verne... And no aircraft, yeah.
I love the idea, smashing idea, But I don't have 80 days, that's all.
I've got three weeks USA publicity,
a week with Brando in Tahiti, Then Stockholm for the Nobel thingy,
then I'm doing "Hamlet" in Moscow For the British Council, so I have no time.
it's the usual story. I spend my life Travelling and seeing nothing at all.
there's no time. Air travel Is just a way of seeing airports.
real travel is what you buy in bookstands And read about in seat 39K.
whoever nowadays could afford 80 days To go around the world?
well, somewhere in the middle of another Flight to another anonymous airport,
I decided that perhaps, after all, I could.
I really want to travel light.
Fogg hardly took anything at all.
all those books! You'll never get them in that bag.
a sweater as well... You'll need a sweater.
I need these. This is survival. I need all those.
Proust? I don't think you'll need all those.
but this might be the big chance To get past page seven!
I can jettison those, you're right.
you don't need that.
I got that in Turkey! It's what I need.
you don't. You can buy another one.
doesn't fit anyway. Ho... Ha!
Tommy Cooper impressions Won't be appreciated!
what about my running shoes? I've got to keep fit.
OK, right. - The books on the bottom.
and there are too many books.
and i've got my drugs, all my drugs. 17 ways of avoiding diarrhoea.
just stick the bottle up... Anyway, mustn't.
I've got a few more things to put in there.
six pairs of pants, six shirts, six socks?
kind of symmetrical.
phileas Fogg left from here 116 years ago
in October 1872.
he set off with head high, clear eye, Never hurried, always calm,
but then, of course, he was fictional.
I've actually got to do it.
to go where he only went In Jules Verne's mind,
across Europe, into Egypt, around The Arabian Peninsula to India,
singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Japan.
then I must follow Fogg Across the Pacific to California.
from there, take a train across America To Halifax, Nova Scotia, or New York.
then to Liverpool, London and home.
the rules: to be back in 80 days And no aircraft.
I will have help. Fogg took a servant, Passepartout.
my Passepartout is five people And works for the BBC.
I thought I was the only one Travelling light. I'm not going.
right, where are the porters? The 40 bearers we're going with?
at the last moment, I remembered to bring A tie. Might be useful for strangling muggers.
we start in style. One of the quickest services across Europe
is still the Orient Express.
Fogg employed friends as referees.
two of them were bankers. Two of mine Are Pythons - Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam.
see, I am leaving.
I think we have to prove to the watching Bods that this is the right day.
right. - There you are, look.
say it. - "Sunday, 25th September, 1988.
what is this? - We want this to be with you everywhere.
in my pocket? That's all I need, really
Bye-bye, love.
Katie, bye-bye!
cheerio, Tom.
Bye-bye, Joan. Bye-bye!
if I kiss everybody, i'll never get on The train. Better take these things!
phileas knew the answer to all this nonsense. He was a bachelor.
my BBC fee!
goodbye!
Bye-bye! Bye-bye, everyone!
why do you all look so happy?!
well, that's it. I've said goodbye. Like it or lump it, I'm off round the world.
I'm quite glad of this soft start.
to tell the truth, although it's only Day One, I'm worn out already.
I'd forgotten that unusual journeys Require unusual preparations.
heart rate is 164.
average test time is five to six minutes.
you're doing well. Keep going there.
so, in summary, therefore, You are very fit.
well done.
I'll be able to carry everybody's bags, But don't tell them that.
you cannot take Indian rupees into India. Similar problem in Egypt.
the other great problem you have That Fogg didn't have is bureaucracy.
the important thing is that your stomach Should be all right,
so take some strong pills.
is this absolutely necessary?
when you fly into a deep calm, You need something to read.
you must have books, preferably About the places you are going to.
I think it's absolutely lunatic, But incredibly exciting.
normally takes seven days. - Bit like hard work.
there we are. I can check on my progress.
use it as a pillow... - Kick it about.
beach ball, yes. Got a lot of on-deck travelling.
then let it down and fold it away.
I'll have to be careful Not to stick pins in it to mark my progress.
shall I take a puncture... A world repair kit?
it should be tough. - Shall we see if it goes down easily?
Yes.
it does actually say on the packet "Blow Up the World..."
could be dangerous. Oh, "Blow-Up World," sorry.
Oh, dear, this'll take us more than 80 days!
I don't think I can get this down every night - As the actress said to the cartographer!
it's all very well While the champagne is flowing,
but what have I got to look forward to?
a lot of sea, that's for sure, But how do I get across it?
lloyd's of London has been the nerve centre Of world shipping for 300 years.
at their headquarters, a great bell is rung Every time a ship is sunk.
I tried to find out how much sea travel Has changed since Fogg's day.
wednesday, 2nd October, 1872. This is the actual day
that the fictional Phileas Fogg set off On the journey I'm going to be making.
and these are a number of boats. What happened to them on that day?
they're in trouble. They've been wrecked, Or had their sails ripped away, or been sunk.
something very serious. - Five... Six at least.
and more over the page.
if I survive the storms and cyclones Is one thing,
but what other problems will I encounter By going country to country by boat now?
is it a regular service or what?
you won't find many regular services.
in the '50s, you'd get a passenger ship From Southampton.
you knew that on Thursday at 4 p. m. You could Get a Union Castle ship to South Africa.
that doesn't happen any more. You'll get A lot of difficulty with time delays.
you're going to find troubles - perhaps A ship that's due to sail on a Thursday
will have boiler trouble, or need a new crew,
perhaps engine repairs, waiting for cargo,
may delay you a day, half a day And put your schedule back all the time.
taking my route, which takes me Across Suez, the Indian Ocean,
the South China Sea, the Pacific And Atlantic, what are my chances?
I will be very surprised if you get round The world in 80 days the way you are going.
I really will.
my early optimism dented, I decided to find Out the problems before they found me.
going through 20 countries one after The other raises all sorts of questions.
thinking of awful emergencies, Suppose I lost all my money?
say it fell into the sea, Or I got my riyals mixed up,
how easy is it for you to get money out to me In an emergency?
you've got our telephone number.
I suggest... I know your voice And most of my staff know your voice,
but someone may answer that doesn't know Michael Palin's voice.
so, we'll have a codeword between us That will identify you.
what do you suggest? "Panic"? "Help"? - No, too obvious.
let's keep it slightly obtuse.
how about the old film of 1979, "Jabberwocky"?
now, who is going to think of that? - Exactly!
I'll never remember that!
jabberwocky it is.
Absolutely.
impressed by my bank manager's Knowledge of old films,
I was beginning to feel a touch intrepid.
after all, ever since I could read, I'd been fascinated by travellers' tales.
would the Royal Geographical Society be Interested in my memoirs of the journey?
practically every explorer of the last 160 Years has presented their papers to us.
the Palin Collection we'd love to have.
you would? - Oh, yes, please.
would I be accorded The title of explorer on this?
if you manage to get round the world In 80 days now, you'll deserve the title.
that is all the motivation I needed.
being an explorer was the first thing I ever wanted to be.
surely childhood dreams don't come true This easily.
I'm not quite as august company as these.
these gold medallists Have done amazing achievements.
there's still a little space at the bottom. - There is.
maybe if I try hard. - Best of luck.
thank you for your help. I'll see you in 80 days.
high above Hyde Park, I tracked down Someone whose name is not found
on the Royal Geographical Society's boards,
but who nevertheless personifies The explorer of the TV age,
someone who spent a lifetime Bringing the world home.
how do you cope when things fall apart Or something unusual happens?
I become tremendously British.
you must always speak English. You Mustn't try and speak the local language.
when the Ton Ton Macoute Are sticking guns into your ribs,
you mustn't try and say, "Please, don't.
you say, "Do you mind standing aside? BBC Television. Just back a bit.
that's exactly what we did And it worked like a dream.
don't speak their language Because you won't do it well
and they have the advantage.
of course, it isn't just me, It's also my Passepartout...
the heavy mob. - My five trusted people.
how do you cope with living day by day With a crew for seven or eight weeks?
it's a hell of a problem, I must say.
but I think you must be honest, Not try to fool the viewer.
when you see Bernard Levin Going over the Pyrenees in his funny shorts,
standing on this peak all alone and solitary,
you know that behind him are two limos Full of pas and his Thermos,
cameramen and everybody else,
you know it's nonsense.
you, creditably, are not pretending You are on your own.
no, it's more them than me. - At least they can carry your stuff.
the other thing to remember Is that any fool can be uncomfortable.
the thing to do is to make yourself comfortable, And you can almost anywhere.
when you're going in this dhow Across the Indian Ocean,
there will be ways of making sure You have the best rowlock to lean on.
I shall remember that!
I'll look in my medical bag For when someone leans on a rowlock!
phileas Fogg put 20, 000 on himself When he left.
I want to know whether these odds Can be more sporting before I bet.
I'm not going to stand here and say You've got no chance, am I?
it's two to one on that you will succeed.
you reckon I'm going to make it? - I do.
when I came to round about The 22nd October,
I did begin to worry.
because you had a look? - Yes. You're going on dhows. What's a dhow?
it's a very rickety wooden boat that is blown Across the Persian Gulf to India.
chances of surviving that!
I don't think that Michael Palin Would go in for something
and not succeed.
you're trying flattery. - How about that?
I've had a look at it... - i'll show you my exam results one day.
I said, "He's really going to do this "because his Christmas dinner when He gets back will be spoiled if he fails!
so it has to be 2-1 on.
that's not bad, you know. Have you got your 20, 000?
get some punters? - You won't get Fogg out?
I'll give you 20. - You must back it, mustn't you?
if everyone else will, too. You'll have a go? There we are.
everyone's gonna have a go. - This could pay for the Christmas dinner!
you see, I have to be very careful Because there are only two variables.
there's very little percentage With just two runners.
I need to be very careful In how I get the odds marked.
it's 6-4 against. Wonder If anyone wants to bet you won't do it.
the last few hundred yards of England.
a final image of home
Folkestone in the autumn sun.
it'll be midwinter when I get back... If I get back.
only when we've cast off the last rope That joins us to the dockside
do I sense with a tightening of the stomach That what we have taken on is irrevocable.
there's no shortcut, no pretence. We have to do it.
the time for talking has passed.
