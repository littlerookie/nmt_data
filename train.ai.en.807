it's bizarre. If he wanted payback, why would he kill himself?
maybe this is his version of payback.
if he takes his own life, we can't put him in prison.
like the ultimate escape plan.
but his body language-- you should have seen it.
when JJ mentioned the copycat murders, he had no idea what she was talking about.
something went wrong and he called an audible.
so what made him change the plan?
well, he did it after his phone call, so I'm guess that had something to do with it.
that's a dead end. Local police traced the number to a prepaid cell phone.
Garcia said it went dead right after Bidwell's call.
a partner?
well, if he really didn't know about the other copycat murders, he wouldn't be somebody's partner, he would be their pawn.
so what if all the evidence in Bidwell's house was put there just so that we'd find it?
jazz hands at the ready.
Garcia, I need you to go over all of Donnie Bidwell's phone records again.
and any emails, social media, whatever you can find.
but why do I have to check it again? His emails were squeaky clean and he wasn't into social media.
the key is in the phone calls.
they had to have communication somehow.
OK, most of his cell phone conversations were to his ex-wife in New York.
he called his mom in Tampa once a week.
the rest are just random.
he called local businesses, he checked movie times.
come on, baby girl, it isn't random.
the answer's in there somewhere. You just gotta find it.
all right, if you say so.
I will re-get this party started. Hit you back.
if the Replicator's still out there, then this whole thing's part of a much bigger manipulation.
I wonder what he's planning for an encore.
go ahead, Garcia.
I want to preface this by saying I did not break any rules by getting this info so fast.
I may have scraped, scratched, massaged, but no breaks. Not a one.
OK. I checked the incoming phone records and there was a call that caught my eye, 'cause for the last 6 months, that call came in at the same time at the same day, except for once.
it's from an unknown phone number, so I did what I do and I made the number known, and it was from a prepaid cell phone.
here's the kicker. Oh, get ready.
it was paid for with the same stolen credit card used to buy JJ's flowers. What? Bam!
can you triangulate the number?
why ask me that question? Triangulation is just about my favorite thing to do. That phone is in Pittsburgh.
that's a 5-hour drive.
or about 45 minutes on the jet.
Yes, ma'am. SWAT is meeting us on the ground.
all right, I will keep you posted. Thank you.
Strauss isn't altogether comfortable with us going on this takedown, but I told her that Pittsburgh P. D. would take the lead.
you know, if the Replicator used Bidwell, then somehow he had to convince him to exsanguinate those women.
and cut off their eyelids.
Bidwell was broken and vulnerable.
he was ripe for a manipulation.
the Replicator must have counted on that.
that's probably why he chose Bidwell in the first place.
well, he must be on persuasive guy.
persuasive enough to turn Bidwell into a killer.
talk to me, mama. You're on the right track.
that phone hasn't been used and hasn't moved.
make the next left. I got it.
guys, I don't like this.
it feels like we're going exactly where he wants us to.
all right.
the snipers are set and all the exits are covered.
air support? Choppers are standing by.
all right, the signal from the cell phone's coming from this room.
we'll enter in two teams.
you from this side, we'll come from this side, we'll meet in the middle.
all right, guys, I need you to keep it tight and stay alert.
this guy's got a vendetta against us.
it could be an ambush.
all right, gents, on the move.
it's clear.
she's gone.
yesterday, while we were in Florida, a body was found in the desert outside Las Cruces, New Mexico.
a man had his leg amputated and replaced with the leg of someone else.
someone's out there mimicking the crimes we've solved.
this is now an active case, which we'll be investigating along with our other cases.
hello. I'm still here.
it's a chess term. It describes the point in the game when a player realizes he'll inevitably be checkmated.
guess what just came to the reception desk for an Agent Jennifer Jareau.
Zugzwang. Who sent it?
they knew you would be at that phone booth, which means they were stalking you.
or us. What if this is the Replicator? The original zugzwang call was directed at me.
if it's directed at one of us, it's directed at all of us.
so far he's committed 3 murders in 3 different states.
if the Replicator's still out there, then this whole thing is part of a much bigger manipulation.
first he was chasing us, and now it's our turn to chase him.
this doesn't make any sense. How in the hell did he get so much access?
Yeah, thank you.
Winslow, Arizona, P. D. statewide system security check reports no breaches.
they were the last.
if the Replicator isn't hacking in, how is he learning details of these crimes.
maybe it's a journalist. They're skilled at obtaining confidential information.
but why not help out his career in the process?
the media didn't know that Adam Rain was making human marionettes, but somehow the Replicator did. He's been watching us for months.
maybe we were the only source he needed.
that would require him to be in two places at the same time.
I've assembled a pretty accurate timetable of the unsub's stalking and murder activities, and based on the estimated time of death regarding our amputated replication, the unsub wasn't stalking us during the investigation of the Whitewood-Turner crimes in Miami because he was dumping his victim in New Mexico.
yet, he was still back in D. C. in time to see me hit my game-winning home run against the Secret Service.
baby girl, this the best you got?
I'm blowing it up as much as I can. What about this?
look at the reflection in Blake's glasses.
it's grainy, but it looks like some creep taking pictures.
you know, we've got all of this and the best we can tell is this guy has a blue baseball cap.
I know and I'm sorry. I promise I will be home before you guys wake up.
well, the sooner we get this guy, the sooner the security detail can go away.
OK. Well, we're trying.
I love you. Erin, what are you doing here so late?
I had a meeting with the Director. I thought we were going to brief him in the morning.
you were. He canceled. You have no fresh leads.
he wants the Replicator classified inactive.
all due respect, ma'am, but this guy's hardly inactive. He's planning his next move.
and when he makes that move, you'll be there to stop him.
how many times have you told me that sometimes the best thing to do is wait, each crime teaches you something new?
the Replicator is dormant. You're not learning anything new.
all you're doing is working yourselves to death and ignoring the cases that need your attention.
Erin, he's stalking this team. No one's gonna give it up.
I know that. And neither will I.
but the cases are piling up and they need to be cleared so the Director no longer thinks that his best unit is dropping the ball.
so, go home.
start fresh tomorrow.
I hate to admit it, but she's right.
I'm sure there's some other psychopath out there planning his next attack.
all right, go get some rest. Back in here by 8: 00.
will, change of plans.
s...
Hey.
Hey. Hey, Nikki.
Nikki, come on.
where are you going?
I can't do this anymore. It's never just one drink.
Oh, come on. - I'm tired of this.
all right. Fine. Just give me a second to close up and we'll head home.
I'm going home alone. You're not going anywhere.
this conversation is over. Let go of me!
I'm not gonna lose you.
let her go, John. - Who the hell are you?
get off me.
you got two choices-- you can leave or I can beat the hell out of you right now.
OK. Ok!
you know what? You're not worth it.
you want her so bad, you can have her.
walk away, John.
thank you. You all right?
I'm fine. I just want to go home. You shouldn't have to put up with that.
Oh, he's not normally like this. He just... had too much to drink.
it's nice to finally meet you, Nicole.
how do you know my name?
what are you doing? Stop it!
I almost knocked you-- Sam?
Penelope. What are you doing in my 'hood?
3-day seminar. I decided to skip the schmoozing over breakfast.
Yeah, you never did have much patience for small talk.
do you need a hand?
uh, Sam, this is Kevin. We work together. Kevin, this is Sam.
we... went on a couple of dates. It was more than a couple dates.
nice to meet you.
so how are the ukulele lessons going? Ukulele lessons?
two months strong. - Two months strong?
you'll have to give me a concert sometime. Medium latte, light foam, extra soy.
that's you. Good memory.
listen, we should catch up. Uh-huh. We should.
perfect. Nice to meet you, Kenneth. Kevin.
did you know that soy milk contains high levels of phytoestrogen, which mimics the functions of estrogen inside humans?
I'm just saying he's gonna have moobs.
what are moobs? Man boobs.
go ahead, Garcia. Yes, sir. Ok.
so, over the past couple of days, two woman have been found murdered with their tongues removed in St. Paul, Minnesota.
the first is Patricia Morris. She was found at a local park by a couple of joggers.
and then a few hours ago Nicole Francis, she was found in a parking lot of a local restaurant.
both women died from multiple stab wounds.
had they been reported missing?
no. In fact, local P. D. were the ones who initially informed the families.
the M. O. is specific. Anything on ViCAP? Nothing yet, but I'm still searching.
well, he definitely wasn't trying to hide the bodies. They were left in very public places.
either he wanted them found quickly or he's all about the act and not the clean-up.
any witnesses? Yeah, sort of.
Nicole was last seen at the restaurant with her boyfriend John Butler.
they had some sort of icky spat. Then he's on the short list.
no, he isn't. He actually has a solid alibi. Eh, liquid.
he was drinking at the bar all night.
right after he left, local P. D. picked him up for public intoxication and they're holding him, but it's just until he sobers up.
OK, it takes a lot of strength to rip out someone's tongue.
it's one of the strongest muscles in the body.
the M. E. is still trying to determine whether it was done ante- or postmortem.
according to Chinese mythology, one of the most dreadful punishments in the 18 levels of hell involves having one's tongue ripped out.
it's considered to be one of the most horrific forms of torture.
it's also symbolic, used to punish liars and anti-regime activists.
the very nature of the M. O. is overkill. We can't rule out a personal vendetta.
these women may have had something on this unsub and he wanted to make sure that they didn't live to talk about it.
wheels up in 30.
Nicole knight laurels open window laurels open window laurels loves to ply
but I knew at night she'd leave that one window open...
just for me.
it was her special invitation to come and play...
our very own game...
of hide and seek.
she wanted me to find her.
and once I did...
I was never going to let her go.
Barbara Grizzuti Harrison once said, "all acts performed in the world begin in the imagination.
the preliminary toxicology report suggests neither woman was drugged.
no sign of a struggle or that he used restraints.
both women suffered solid blows to the head. Probably how he subdued them.
neither victim showed signs of sexual assault. Maybe he's impotent.
or sadistic. The stabbing could be what's getting him off.
I have looked into both of the victims.
the only thing they have in common are the same zip code.
they have different occupations, interests, hobbies.
Patricia was a pilates instructor, and Nicole was a legal assistant.
both were low risk. He could just be picking them at random.
if his primary motive is to kill, it explains why he didn't take either of his victims to a secondary location.
but what take such a huge risk? Both crime scenes have tons of foot traffic.
someone could have interrupted him. Oh, boy. Local P. D. just discovered two bodies.
laurel Tyson, 25, and her brother Daryl, 28. They were both stabbed to death inside her house.
attacking in the home hasn't been his M. O. Up until now they've all been very public places.
two attacks on 3 victims in one night. This is the first time he's killed a male.
is this turning into a spree?
Garcia, were their tongues missing?
uh, Laurel's was. Daryl's was still intact.
if this is a spree, why is he taking time to collect souvenirs?
Garcia, expand your ViCAP search nationwide.
the ritual of the tongue extraction seems to be what matters most to him.
detective Boseman. Thanks for coming out.
thanks for having us. I'm Dr. Reid. This is Agent Morgan.
nice to meet you.
according to neighbors, somebody noticed an open window early this morning and alerted authorities.
nothing violates one's sense of security more than being attacked in their own home.
why didn't the alarm trigger when the window was opened? That's a good question.
maybe he knew what he was doing. Excuse me.
Hey, give it to me good, baby girl.
unfortunately, all I have are daily coffee receipts and weekly Thai orders. Laurel didn't get out much.
she worked from home as a telemarketer, spent a lot of time surfing the web.
her most recent splurge was a last-minute plane ticket for her brother.
Garcia, when did Laurel have the alarm installed? Two weeks ago.
she lived here 3 years and didn't feel the urge to install an alarm until now.
Thanks, mama.
maybe she flew him out here because she was scared.
having her brother around would make her feel more protected.
and if Laurel was the target, then Daryl's presence would have come as a surprise to the unsub.
making him a victim of circumstance.
the question is, how do you learn about 3 separate women that lived 3 completely different lives?
your report mentioned you found rust fragments in the victims' stomachs.
have you been able to determine if they were from the knife?
either that or from the other object. Other object?
the assailant used two weapons, one to grip and the knife to severe the tongue.
something like pliers.
well, that's new, isn't it?
she was the only one with this type of bruising. I'm still doing tissue samples.
all 3 women had copious amounts of blood in both their lungs and their stomachs.
they were still alive when their tongues were cut out.
I'm really sorry about Nicole.
can you tell me what you remember from last night?
Nicole got a raise a few days ago.
so I wanted to take her out to celebrate.
we started drinking, me more than her.
sometimes people overdrink in an attempt to mask their pain.
were you and Nicole having relationship problems?
we hadn't been on the same page for a while.
she'd just gotten a great promotion and I was laid off a few months back.
is that why the two of you decided to move in together last month?
in theory it was a perfect idea.
till the issue of money came up.
was that how the argument started last night?
she complained about how much I was drinking.
she stormed out of the restaurant. Hey, Nikki.
I followed her into the parking lot. Nikki, come on.
and the next thing I know, some guy is slamming me into the car.
get off me! Do you think you could describe him?
did you see his face?
I was drunk. I wasn't thinking straight.
it's my fault.
I never should have left her out there.
you want her so bad, you can have her.
I figured he was someone she knew.
why would you think that?
walk away. John. Because he knew my name.
go ahead, Garcia.
sir, I did premium spelunking on these 3 women and they were super duper active online,
I mean chat rooms, blog, Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook, you name it.
that could be how the unsub knew about John Butler. Patricia was on multiple dating sites.
and Laurel?
Oh, Laurel. She had a blog that makes "50 Shades of Grey" read like a children's book.
it sounds like that's how he knew these women. Thanks, Garcia.
Tammy's tammy: what are you doing online? Aren't you at work
is that work-related or personal?
Hello! Peter, I asked you a question.
is that personal or work-related?
is everything all right? I'm sorry, what?
are you coming to the staff potluck tomorrow? Yeah, I'll be there.
sure you're ok?
fine.
anything? Well, these women practically lived online.
their posts went up 5, 6 times an hour.
Brian used his own toilet for the first time today.
all right, cut her some slack. She's excited. Her son is potty-trained.
Brian is her cocker spaniel. Hmm. Check this out.
at 1: 14, Nicole posted a status update saying she's waiting for somebody to rescue her from a loveless relationship.
I assume she's referring to her and John. On 1-8, Patricia tweeted, quote, "Saw one of the most beautiful oak trees "in the park. I wish I could just take a nap under it like I did when I was a little girl." End quote.
on 2-18, Laurel posted on her personal blog about how much she likes pain.
she describes it as, "the best foreplay.
then on 2-21, again Laurel posts, talking about a fantasy where someone climbs through the window and ravishes her with bondage.
that's exactly how the unsub entered her house-- through the living room window.
laurel was the only one with ligature marks. He knew she was into S&M.
technically, the unsub's the one that rescued Nicole from the argument she was having with her boyfriend.
he was the one that whisked her away.
and the first victim, Patricia, was found in a local park under a tree.
so these women unknowingly described their own murders.
this guy targeted these women through their online activity?
in the unsub's mind, their posts created a connection to him, which led to the initial stalking.
that tells us he's most likely socially awkward.
tammy: hey you. how's your day going? I'm getting a couple if laps in at the pool still stuck at work
and his online surveillance allowed him to build confidence over time.
it's likely these women don't know what the unsub looks like, making it possible for him to interact with them without revealing his true identity.
what his victims considered pure fantasy, the unsub interpreted as literal and open invitation.
that compulsion is specific to his psychopathology.
if he's getting these readings on the web, his next inspiration could come from anywhere.
Kayla ignored me, pretended like I wasn't even there.
time after time she'd walk by me...
never acknowledging my presence.
did she even know I existed?
she was going to learn tonight.
no matter what, she was finally going to see me.
No!
and I wanted to make sure that my face...
was the last one...
she'd ever see.
the victim was Kayla Jefferson, 19, local college student.
she lives on the third floor. A neighbor discovered her body.
his ritual remained the same, even though his M. O. changed from stabbing to strangulation.
we'll have Garcia check her Internet history.
well, why didn't he kill her the same way he killed the others?
he must have been inspired by a new fantasy. We're ready to deliver the profile.
we're looking for a fit, aggressive, Caucasian male in his mid- to late 30s.
he's practicing what's called vicarious fantasy assimilation.
this refers to the cathartic release that comes when he turns someone else's thoughts or fantasies into reality.
he trolls the Internet and is selecting women with a strong online presence and who frequently post their fantasies with descriptive detail.
there are two levels to his M. O. the first being the enjoyment he gets from taking one of his victim's fantasies and turning it into a nightmare.
once he establishes his dominance by subverting that fantasy, then he moves on to step two, which is removing the tongue.
his M. O. is polymorphic. It's taken on different forms.
however, his ritual never changes.
Tammy
Oh, I am so sorry.
it's ok.
it's likely that there are other women he's already targeted, so be vigilant if there are any reports of suspicious behavior.
thank you.
this is Alicia Danner reporting live to you from outside the 13th Street apartment building, where the body of a local college student has just been identified as Kayla Jefferson.
police are also releasing the names and photos of the other 4 victims
no, no, no. who were brutally murdered during the recent strain of attacks.
the FBI is asking anyone with information about this case to contact the taskforce hotline shown on your screen.
those are my girls. These are my stories.
my stories.
betr
so, Sam-- he seemed like a nice guy.
Yeah. He--he is.
Ricky D. He was a nice guy, too.
who's Ricky d? My college roommate.
drank coffee from sunup to sundown.
spent 4 years with the guy, and I never once remembered how he took his coffee.
you lost me at Ricky. I thought you said you guys just went on a couple dates.
that's what this is about, that I know what Sam puts in his coffee?
might I remind you that whose coffee order I memorize is no longer any of your business.
I--I just thought
you and I will finish this later.
Yeah. So Kayla was not at all into modern technology.
I mean, she didn't even own a computer, so that means there's no Facebook, no Twitter, no blogs, no nothing.
she never even activated her college email account.
well, if she doesn't fit his pattern, how do you know about here?
good question, chocolate thunder.
I did a search on Kayla's name and it turns out she had a scary admirer.
what do you mean?
I mean that a 16-year-old boy named Tyler Rogers dedicated a blog to her.
he had a lot of interesting things to say on it.
he lived in the same apartment building as Kayla.
lived?
Yeah. He was institutionalized early January for attacking his mother.
that can't be our guy. He's been locked up for months.
but we should still talk to him. He might be able to give us something.
let's get Reid on it. Thanks, Garcia.
...
my fingers tightened around her throat.
I could feel her heartbeat pulsing under my fingertips.
when did you write this?
sunday, December 15, 2012, 4: 14 p. m.
did Kayla do something to upset you?
she ignored me.
again.
and that made you want to kill her?
you're funny. Your move.
Tyler, Kayla is dead.
someone took one of the stories you wrote and made it real.
was there a lot of blood?
your blog went into great detail about how you wanted to kill her.
now, I need to know, did you discuss this with anyone?
with people on story swap, yeah.
bloo ...
...
so story swap allows you to download stories from other people.
are they all about murder? Most of them.
but, you know, there was something for everyone.
rape and torture...
thanks for your help.
do you have any pictures of, uh, Kayla's body?
just wondered. I just want to see what he did to her.
unfortunately, Tyler's still struggling, but a number of clinical studies have proven that a person experiences the same neurochemical release from the simple act of documenting a fantasy or a violent act.
no offense, Dr. Houston, but isn't this therapy intended to help traumatized victims, not perpetrators?
while writing therapy as applied to offenders may be somewhat controversial, it's proven to be very effective if done properly.
what do you mean by properly?
well, I believe there are two phases to this type of treatment.
having the patient document the fantasy, then having them acknowledge the shame and the guilt.
if this treatment is so important to you, why did you take your name off it?
I cut ties when I learned many of the facilities weren't implementing the second phase.
what were they doing instead?
they were allowing the patients to focus more on their fantasies without discussing the root of the problem.
was Tyler able to give you anything? So it turns out he was part of an online community that exchanged psychopathic stories while remaining anonymous.
it's probably where the unsub learned about Kayla, from Tyler's posts.
which explains the switch in M. O. Tyler was fixated on strangulation.
so, where's the unsub gonna get his material for his next kill?
all the victims used different platforms. Writing seems to be the only common denominator.
guys, what if he created his own writing group? Dr. Houston's spoken all over the country.
he could have attended a conference or read about his form of therapy.
and adapted it to fit his needs.
instead of working the steps, he's focused on one thing
acting out homicidal stories.
and a vivid description of the blood, how it felt.
I can tell you dug deep for this one.
thank you, Tina.
I believe we have time for one more story.
I've got one.
the title of this one is "Betrayed.
I never knew someone I trusted "would hurt me so deeply.
tonight I'm going to make him pay for stealing what I valued most.
keep reading.
you haven't gotten to the best part.
what I don't understand is why this guy's removing all the tongues.
well, the tongues symbolize the telling of tales. In his mind they're trophies.
and by taking them, he was able to claim possession of stories that weren't his own.
it's likely the others in the group aren't aware of what he's doing.
but with the specificity of these crimes, it's only a matter of time before people put the pieces together.
thank you very much. Good night, guys. See you next week.
so what'd you think?
we're getting a lot of calls, but so far none of the leads are panning out.
go ahead, baby girl. Talk to me. I got a hit on ViCAP. 3, one-offs, actually.
tampa, Atlanta, Charlotte. 3 women in the last two years who've all had their
it never gets less disgusting to say--tongues removed.
so this isn't the first time he's done this. This is not his first creepy rodeo.
Nope, according to my digging, one of the first talks that Dr. Houston gave was at an anonymous call center in Tampa where a gentleman named Mark Jackson was working, who mysteriously went AWOL a few days later.
shortly thereafter, tongueless bodies start showing up.
guess where he lives now. St. Paul. Got a local address?
Uh-huh, of course I do. I have home and a place where he teaches a writing group every Wednesday.
thank you, mama.
why did you stop? Come on, I want feedback.
I'll have notes next week, Peter.
Oh, come on, Mark. Now is not the time to be shy.
I'd rather not.
what is it you'd like to say? Speak and be heard.
so please continue. Is something wrong?
you plagiarized my work. That's what's wrong.
for 3 months I confided in you. I told you everything.
listen to me.
you told me that if wrote about my fantasies, they would go away.
instead you just took them from me. I said that it would help suppress
no. No. All you really wanted was to take what was in my head for yourself.
excuse me?
let's get one thing straight.
you are weak.
what I did, you could never do yourself.
was she going to be next?
who? Tammy.
was she next? Answer me.
I can't let you have her. That one's special.
she was gonna meet with me, you know.
Peter... She makes me feel normal.
we have a real connection.
and now you want to take her away from me?
you should be honored that I chose your stories.
I did everything that you described, down to the smallest detail.
Oh, I see.
and that's where you're wrong.
what are you talking about?
there's one detail you got wrong.
I never cared about the tongue.
that was you.
clear! Clear!
he's not here.
it's Mark Jackson. It's definitely our guy, but somebody got to him before we could.
Hotch, we never profiled a second unsub. Well, we didn't have one until now.
well, we got guys canvassing the area for witnesses, but whoever did this to Mark didn't hold back.
Thanks. That had to be personal.
no one walks around carrying that type of rage.
this kill doesn't show the same level of confidence that Mark showed with his previous victims.
mark could be his first kill. It most likely won't be his last.
Thanks, Garcia.
well, she figured out what made Mark tick.
when he was 10, he confessed to his mother that her boyfriend had been abusing him.
let me guess.
when Child Protective Services arrived, she changed her story.
told them Mark had made the whole thing up. It explains the tongues. He viewed all women as liars.
it looks like he documented every attack.
Mm-hmm. The semantics in these two writings are markedly different.
they were all composed by different authors.
call first. To whom am I speaking with this evening? My name is Peter.
Hi, Peter. How can I help you?
uh, I'm not sure where to start. Start wherever is most comfortable.
I feel I'm at a crossroads.
the point in my life where...
I'm faced with some tough decisions.
the kind that once you commit, you can never go back.
making a choice can be stressful for anyone.
I just... need something to point me in the right direction.
I understand. We all experience moments where we need clarity in life.
it's important you understand it's something that everyone goes through.
Hello? Hello. Peter?
havn' t heard from you today
...
let me get this straight. Mark encouraged his group members to go after these women?
not exactly. He wanted them to document their violent thoughts and emotions down to the last detail.
and he used those as blueprints for his kills. We think our new unsub was in the group.
when he discovered what Mark had done, he unraveled.
and now that he's given in to his urges, he may want to kill again.
pat in the Park." "Nicole's Knight." "Laurel's Open Window.
sound familiar? Those were the first 3 victims.
they were all written by someone named Peter.
his most recent story is about saving a woman named Tammy from drowning in a lake.
it's 30 degrees outside. They'd freeze to death.
sir, yes, sir.
Garcia, what's the name of the organization where Mark volunteered? - Call first.
all right. Check their phone records for the days Mark worked, for any calls that came in from someone named Peter.
OK, this is a crazy popular hotline. They get a ton of calls, like a half a dozen Peters.
any of them call multiple times? Let me see--mm, mm, mm
here's one--Peter Harper. It looks like Mark initially took the call.
and the last time Peter called the hotline was... less than an hour ago.
where would Peter Harper be now? Rosewood, just outside of St. Paul.
Yeah, that's gotta be him. But where is he taking Tammy?
it looks like she's a swimmer. Water is crucial to Peter's fantasy.
Hey, there's a community center nearby. I'm sending you the digits right now.
Thanks, Garcia.
somebody help!
please? Hello? Is someone there?
who are you? What am I doing here?
God, you're even more beautiful up close.
don't touch me.
who are you?
it's me, Peter.
Oh, my God.
why are you doing this?
I need your help with something I've been struggling with for a while now.
what is it?
I need you to convince me not to kill you.
please tell me why you're doing this. I had to protect you from him.
what? Who?
it doesn't matter anymore. He's gone now.
don't cry.
do you know how long I've waited for this moment?
I wrote something for you.
if she only knew how special she was, "how she made me feel human for the first time.
but...
if she knew about the secret thoughts I had, would she stay?
what do you think?
you need help.
Peter, I can be there for you.
I know the moment I untie you, you'll leave.
I already lost someone today. I can't lose you, too.
you have my word.
God, I wish I believed you.
no, no, no.
I couldn't have written this any better.
Peter Harper, FBI! Don't move! Drop the knife, Peter!
I can't. I'm going in.
mark was a liar and a thief and I made him pay.
Peter, I know he betrayed your trust.
just put the knife down and we can talk about this.
you don't know what it's like
the thoughts and the images that won't go away.
this is my only option. Peter, that's not true.
listen, I know exactly what it's like.
right now is the part where I'm supposed to lie to you, tell you that everything's gonna be ok and that we can somehow help you, but the fact of the matter is, Peter, I don't know if we can.
there might not be any form of therapy that ever takes these urges away.
Spence, what are you doing? But that doesn't mean you stop trying.
Peter, no matter what happens, you have to keep trying.
I know it's not what you want to hear, but at least it's the truth.
I appreciate your honesty.
Oscar Wilde said, "I can resist anything except temptation.
Reid. I just finished the case file.
I talked to Morgan and JJ and I wanted to talk to you about what happened.
the hostage was clear and I made a tactical decision to tell the unsub the truth about his condition.
and what did you think that would accomplish?
well, Hotch, I thought the last time I was in a situation like this, I did exactly what I was supposed to.
I told a perfect lie and that didn't work, so this time, in the hopes of saving someone's life, I tried something different.
and this didn't work.
sadly, no.
to me, this is very clearly about Maive.
I just wanted to apologize for the way I acted earlier.
no. No, no, no. Please, please don't apologize.
that was all me. I was being really snappy.
I just... Well, I never knew you were taking ukulele lessons.
Yeah. It's number 32 on my I don't want to call it a bucket list, bucket list.
you know, I never thought we'd be here.
well, when you break up with someone, there's that fantasy that you can stay friends, which I guess is a fantasy.
Penelope, I want to be friends.
so do I. But can you handle it?
because friends support each other and their relationships, and so far I have seen you now date Gina, Lisa,
Mindy, Leslie, Shannon, Gina again. I get it.
I mean-- it's not easy for me, but I want you to be happy.
same here. Ok. Ok, I gotta go.
Hey.
by the way, Gina really liked the bracelet you helped me pick out.
well, I do know jewelry.
I'll see you tomorrow. Bright and early.
I don't know how much longer I can contain the crowd.
thank you.
OK. Ahem.
tonight's premiere performance will be my rendition of "Old MacDonald had a Farm.
hold on.
1 YEAR AGO
Hey, let's keep the water in the tub, ok?
5 more minutes and then mommy's gotta get ready for work.
why did you always go to work, Mommy?
well, um, because there's people out there that need my help.
but I will be back soon.
how many days? I don't know, buddy. I wish I did.
but I promise I will be back as soon as I can.
and we always keep our promises, right?
Yeah. Yeah.
OK, well, then you need to promise that you're gonna be a good boy for daddy while I'm gone.
give me a high five.
we're gonna make a pre-emptive trip to Los Angeles.
this unsub kills on the same date every year.
go ahead, Garcia.
OK. I present to you, crime-fighters, an oldie but not such a goodie.
I give you Rachel Hughes, Melissa Martinez,
Tara Rios, Diana Brooks, and Gloria Clemente.
you guys know the deets. This is news to you, Blake.
over the last 5 years, each of these women have disappeared from a park off the California coast, from as far south as San Diego and far north as San Francisco.
each of them were nannies who were kidnapped while watching kids.
thankfully, each of the little ones was returned to a church or hospital totally unharmed within 24 hours.
but the nannies were found dead, posed on park benches and Los Angeles playgrounds.
one a year, always on the same date.
may 13. The actual abduction date varies from case to case, but the unsub goes to great lengths to make sure the bodies are found that exact day.
all except victim number 3, Tara Rios.
somehow she managed to escape.
garbage truck driver found her passed out in an alley in Hollywood.
she had no idea who took her or where he held her.
morgan and I questioned her, I even tried to do cognitive, but she was way too traumatized to remember much of anything at all.
clearly she dissociated from the event.
we've contacted her several times over the past few years trying to get more info, but she just refuses to talk to us.
her reluctance isn't surprising.
each of the victims was sexually assaulted and tortured with burning implements for several days.
and then he drowned them in scalding water when he was done.
but no matter where he grabs them, he always returns them to L. A.
both the location and that date obviously means something significant, but what?
may 13 is two weeks away.
Garcia, go ahead and alert the press on the West Coast.
when we land in L. A. Morgan and JJ will take the jet to Seattle and make a personal plea to Tara Rios.
wheels up in 30.
OK, see you guys next week.
Bye, Miss Gina. Bye.
I want to go feed the birds.
you hungry for lunch? We got some macaroni and cheese.
maybe you'll actually eat your broccoli today. You got your hands full, huh?
cute. What is she, about 2? Yeah, almost.
what's her name? Phoebe.
Hi, Phoebe. My daughter's almost 8.
enjoy your day. You, too.
excuse me.
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
it's ok.
just shut your mouth. Don't make me hurt the baby instead.
Hi, Phoebe.
children are educated by what the grownup is and not by his talk.
Carl Jung.
other than their occupation, there's no connection between these victims.
his need to commemorate the anniversary is what's behind it and whatever message he's trying to send.
and what exactly is he trying to say?
well, whatever it is, this anniversary date has to be associated with some kind of long-term stressor.
that date could be anything.
Birthdate, death date, a traumatic event.
his first victim, Rachel Hughes, was the only one be both kidnapped and dumped in Griffith Park.
well, the first time is usually the most significant.
newsflash, my family, and how I wish it was the good kind.
another nanny and a kid just disappeared in Los Angeles.
her name is Gina Mendes. She was watching a 2-year-old named Phoebe Payton.
think that's our guy? I'd bet on it.
I think he's ahead of schedule. He's never abducted his victims more than 4 days before the anniversary date.
Los Angeles Police Department INTERVIEW ROOM
Phoebe's got asthma.
and she needs regular nebulizer treatments.
Gina always carries some, but it won't last.
how long has Gina worked for you? Oh, about 4 years.
that's a long time. The baby is barely 2.
Yeah. We hired her when we got pregnant...
the first time. I'm sorry, the first time?
I had a late miscarriage, and then we had a stillbirth.
Gina stayed on.
you know, we were both pretty shook up, and I travel a lot for work.
so, she helped out around the house.
Gina doesn't just work for us, she's like family.
she lost both her parents when she was a teenager, so it's kind of like we adopted her in a way.
it's true, right? This man, he always
he always gives the kids back? Yes, he has.
and they're ok?
he doesn't-- he's returned all of the children unharmed in the first 24 hours, either to a church or to a hospital.
Oh, God.
she needs her medicine. She has asthma.
please, let me help her.
you all pretend to care, but you just want to save your own skin.
you're all the same.
she'll die! She'll die if you can't take the pain.
in their statements, two of the other families said the same thing about their nannies.
she was more than just an employee.
she was almost like family.
well, it's not uncommon to form that kind of a bond with your child's caregiver.
but what if the connection they have with the children is what sparks the unsub's interest?
maybe it's not just about them being nannies.
he could be keying in on the relationship itself.
and he would have to stalk them and know their routines well enough to be able to pick up on that.
I'll have Reid and Rossi retrace Gina's steps, and we should interview the victims' families again.
if he sticks to his schedule, Phoebe could turn up soon.
let's hope so.
I just talked to a bunch of nannies over at the observatory.
they knew Gina and Phoebe.
said they're here every, uh, Tuesday and Thursday.
a regular schedule or routine gives children a sense of security.
that would make it easy for him to stalk her.
he knew exactly when she would be here.
she never made it back to the car, which means he grabbed her somewhere between here and the observatory.
broad daylight, public park, LAPD regularly patrolling the area. This guy's got cojones.
he probably threatens the children as a means to gain the nanny's compliance.
well, we know he's got his own transport. It's gotta be a van or an SUV.
and he's patient. He only kills once a year.
the rest of the time, he's stalking or planning.
one thing's different, though. He's back in Griffith Park.
coincidence?
Griffith Park spans 4, 310 acres, making it one of the largest urban parks on all of North America.
given the sheer size, coincidence certainly is a possibility.
but he's never repeated parks before.
no, he hasn't.
Seattle
more iced tea, please.
Hey, Tara. It's been a long time.
what are you guys doing here? We need to talk to you.
well, you should have called me first.
we did. You never called us back.
you have no right just showing up to my work like this.
we apologize, but this is-- Couldn't you just talk to my doctor?
he knows everything that's going on with me. The unsub took another nanny today, Tara.
her name's Gina Mendes
stop. Stop it.
I don't want to know her name. Tara, we really need your help.
I already told you guys everything that I can remember.
Tara, that was 3 years ago. We're hoping that you'll give it another try.
your memories aren't lost, they're just locked up.
we know this is a lot...
but we'll be with you the whole time.
the little girl who was with Gina, her name's Phoebe, and she has asthma and she needs special medication.
and--and Gina, right now she's going through exactly what you went through.
which means if we don't find her, she's only got two weeks to live.
please. Help us.
no.
LAPD's got every church and hospital in the city covered.
so far nothing. Maybe the police presence scared him off.
they're only using plainclothes. Even so, this guy has evaded arrest for this long.
he's probably got a nose for cops.
I don't know. He's a creature of habit.
veering off his schedule would be a big departure in his M. O.
he's already veering from his schedule, though. I mean, he abducted Gina earlier than expected.
he never keeps the children longer than 24 hours.
he's had Phoebe for 28.
I wonder what that means for Gina.
will he stick to his schedule with her? He returned all 5 of the other kids.
why is he holding Phoebe?
we should consider the implications if he doesn't bring her back.
agent Hotchner? Yes.
have you heard anything?
no, nothing yet. I'm sorry.
so...so what now?
we keep pursuing the investigation. We leave no stone unturned.
but you said he always gives the kids back within 24 hours. It's been almost 30.
that's true, that's been his pattern, yes. So where's Phoebe?
we're trying to figure it out.
have you checked with all the hospitals? Yes, we have.
well, what about the churches? She could be there.
we're covering the churches, too, I promise you.
so you just don't know a damn thing.
Mrs. Payton-- you should be out there right now.
even my husband is out there looking, putting up flyers.
how can you be looking for her from in here?
I understand what you're going through. You don't understand anything.
no, I actually do.
maybe we can find a place where we can talk.
agents, I'd like to help, but I can't disclose the details of Tara's therapy.
frankly, I'm surprised she gave me permission to talk to you.
Dr. Berneman, Tara is the only victim who's seen this man and survived.
there's two lives at stake here.
we're just trying to get some insight.
well, I can tell you this
,when Tara first came to me, she was suffering from extreme PTSD.
for lack of a better clinical term, she was a hot mess.
she would scratch at the burn scars on her arm till they bled.
she had insomnia, and when she did sleep, she had nightmares.
I noticed that she repeatedly snapped a hair tie around her wrist.
that's a form of aversion therapy.
when negative feelings about the event start to take over, she snaps the rubber band.
it helps her keep control.
call it a supplement to a pretty strict regimen that helps her keep control.
but she's got a long way to go.
are you telling us that we shouldn't be trying to question her?
I'm telling you we worked very hard for two years.
Tara's finally approaching normal.
she's got a job. She paints.
she even had a date last week.
I would hate to put her through anything that might set her back.
all right, Doctor, well, we appreciate you taking time out of your vacation.
feel free to call if you need anything else. Thank you, Doctor.
it looks like we may need to give Tara her space.
Yeah, well, it's too bad, because she's the only real lead we've got.
I'm at a dead end.
I spoke to the families of the previous victims and they had nothing to add to their original statements.
why hasn't he returned Phoebe Payton yet? There has to be a reason.
I hate to state the obvious, but maybe he killed her.
but why take the time, effort, and risk to return all the other kids just to kill this one?
you know, she could have succumbed to an asthma attack.
or we're looking at this wrong.
what if he's finally found the kid he's really been looking for?
but we profiled him as a sexual sadist with rage issues.
the children have no value to him. It's the nannies he wants.
the first part of that still could be right. Clearly he's a sadist.
but what if the kids are more valuable to him than the nannies?
then the nannies are collateral damage in the hunt for what he really wants--a child.
and somehow Phoebe Payton fits the bill. That explains why he abducted her earlier than expected.
well, why wouldn't he just grab the children, then? Because he's attracted to the dynamic between nanny and child.
it could also be a forensic countermeasure.
if he only took the children, he would have left witnesses behind.
but what's so special about Phoebe? What makes her different from the others?
the asthma.
hallelujah, this place is dead. Give me a job, give me a job
Garcia, I need you to check the health records of all 5 kids that the unsub returned.
any special needs, any medications. Okey-dokey artichokey.
uh...
everyone healthy as a horse.
that's super healthy. Clean bill. Nothing.
Thanks, Garcia.
Really? That's all?
but I have so many skills to help. Please?
Hello?
if his ultimate objective is the kid, then he may abandon his schedule altogether.
which means Gina may not have until may 13.
we need a targeted media strategy. I'll go get Hotch.
we believe we're looking for a Caucasian male who's almost certainly a resident of Los Angeles county.
as you know, he operates on a strict yearly schedule, which takes patience and discipline.
which leads us to believe he's in his late 30s or 40s.
he abducts his victims from public parks in broad daylight, which tells us that he's socially competent, fits in, appears non-threatening.
in other words, he's someone you'd never notice.
do you think he'll abduct more victims anytime soon?
it's possible, though we find it highly doubtful. His schedule seems to be very important to him.
then why hasn't he returned the baby yet?
we think he suffers from a rare psychological disorder called paternal desire.
like its sister disorder, maternal desire, it stems from a deep-seated need to fill an emotional void left by the loss of a child.
we think that loss may be related to some kind of long-term stressor in his life.
and this explains why he exhibits so much rage and violence against the nannies that he abducts.
he's shown little mercy toward his adult victims, but he's been compassionate to the children.
and it's that sense to which we'd like to appeal.
at this point I'd like to introduce Shane and Melody Payton.
these are Phoebe's parents and Gina's employers. Mr. and Mrs. Payton.
please... If you're watching this or if you know the man who did this, please contact the authorities.
Phoebe's just... she's just a baby.
and our nanny, Gina, she is a good person.
she doesn't deserve this. Just do the right thing and let them go, please.
the baby has severe asthma and she needs this medication.
she can't breathe without it.
please let them go.
give our baby back!
we've issued an AMBER Alert and set up a toll-free hotline.
if anyone has any information at all...
Yeah, this is Derek Morgan. Yes.
can you hold on? Just a second.
go ahead.
Really? That would be great.
OK. Thank you.
that was Tara Rios.
what happened? She wants to help us.
you're kidding.
she saw the press conference.
JJ, good work. It was your idea to go national.
I'm gonna get them to turn us around.
I just wanted to let you know that we've convinced a witness to come forward.
she's a victim who had escaped.
I realize it's not the news you're hoping for, but even the smallest piece of information could help us find Phoebe and Gina.
in the meantime, it would be a good idea if you could go home and get some rest.
it would do you some good.
no, no, we're not going anywhere.
so, what makes you think that it's gonna work this time?
well, we're gonna try something new.
it's a psychotherapy called EMDR.
it stands for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing.
it's very effective with PTSD and memories that have been buried especially deep.
what if I can't?
what if there's really nothing in there?
there's evidence that suggests we process intellectual material in a different part of the brain than emotional material.
EMDR helps link the two.
Tara, we will be with you the whole time.
and you're gonna help us catch this guy.
I promise you.
how does this...EMDR thing, how does it work?
first we'll start by putting you in a safe place, mentally, by asking you to focus on a particular image, a memory that makes you happy.
and then we'll start asking questions.
and then when you're ready, we'll have you follow a light that moves side to side.
so, can you tell us about Jake?
he was adorable.
big blue eyes.
he was such a good boy.
when was the last time you saw him?
that day. The day that we got taken.
we went to the park, like we always did.
Jake loved the park.
what's the first thing that comes to mind when you think about that day?
it was chilly.
I forgot my coat.
what can you tell us about the abduction itself?
it all happened so quickly.
that's ok. Take your time.
a man came up to us. I think
I think he had a leash in his hand.
did he have a dog?
Yeah. Yeah, he did.
that's good. You didn't remember that before.
do you know what kind of dog?
no, but it was big. I didn't...
I didn't want it near Jake.
he said...
he said Jake reminded him of his baby sister.
...my baby sister.
you said before he was a white guy.
can you see his face?
no.
but he has a gun and he's
he's pointing it at Jake.
Oh, God.
calm down.
just concentrate on the light.
what happened next?
he hit me...
in my face, then I fell.
Jake was crying and...
I couldn't help him.
I couldn't do anything.
I...I think I passed out.
I...
I...
the burning...
woke me up.
he was using cigarettes.
I was tied to a bed.
he kept saying, "Can you take it?
and he said if I couldn't take it that he was gonna do it to Jake.
Oh, my God.
OK. You're safe now,
Jake, he won't stop crying.
help me. Help me.
he says he needs help.
you actually heard the word "help"?
Yeah.
that can't be Jake, Tara.
he's too little to talk.
help me! Help me.
no, it was a woman.
a woman?
what woman?
I don't know.
help me, please!
I don't know! I need to stop now.
I need to stop.
how you doing?
you need anything?
how could that stuff...
be hidden in my head all these years?
I feel like I'm going crazy.
you're not.
it's just your brain's way of protecting you.
that's them, isn't it?
that little girl's parents?
are they ok?
not so much.
you have kids?
Yeah. Yeah, a little boy, Henry.
how old is he?
he's 4 1/2.
Oh, that's a great age.
who's--who's with him now?
uh, well, uh, right now his dad is at work, so...
he's with his nanny.
this is working.
but we've gotta keep going.
the answers are in there. I know it.
but we're running out of time.
look, I made you a promise that we would catch this guy.
please help me keep it.
OK, Tara, I want you to focus on the screams of that woman.
where were you when you heard them?
help me! Help me, please!
help!
it was when he was burning me.
did you ever see her?
no.
wait.
Oh, my God, the van.
the van-- she was there, too.
can you describe her?
there's blood in my eyes. Um...
she was--she was wearing a blue shirt.
was that the only time that you saw her?
I got out. I wanted to search for Jake, but I couldn't hear him crying anymore.
I saw her.
I saw her in the bathroom...
tied to a sink.
she had blond hair.
and I...
Roscoe, shut up!
I left them there.
I left them both there.
can you think of anything else about her?
her name, maybe?
can you take it, Alison?
her name was Alison.
that's what he would call her when he was hurting her.
so if this mystery blonde in blue was in the van with Tara, that means the unsub probably grabbed them on the same day.
he's never taken more than one woman at a time, though.
maybe she wasn't part of the plan.
JJ and Morgan are still working with Tara.
she thinks she might be able to describe the unsub enough to get a composite sketch.
what have you got, Garcia?
what I've got is a promotion coming, 'cause, damn, I am good.
a very blond Alison Astor was reported missing 3 years ago.
now, she's from Dallas, but she never returned home from a business trip she took to Los Angeles.
she was single, she worked as a sales rep for a pharmaceutical company, she was an avid runner.
she even qualified for the Boston marathon, which is not easy.
all right, call the coroner's office and see if there are any unidentified female remains for the last 3 years.
um, sir, you're talking to me. That's already done.
it's L. A. so there are 12 unidentified female bodies, but only one with blond hair, wearing a blue shirt, and the coroner is expecting you, and you're welcome.
sorry about the wait. She was way in the back and her possessions were up in storage.
here's the report.
she was scheduled to be buried soon, but every day we I. D. one of our Jane Does.
you weren't able to determine exact cause of death.
inconclusive. She was too decomposed.
found in a shallow grave up in a remote part of Griffith Park.
so she was out there at least a year before she was found.
critters must have got to her, too. Yeah. They went to town.
you can see bite marks on her tibia, fibula.
they're on her radius, too.
something weird on this leg.
these bite marks here-- too big for anything out in Griffith Park.
I'd say that's from a very large dog, one pushing 100 pounds or so.
let me help her.
the nebulizer is in my bag.
the steam won't work. She needs her medicine!
he puts the nannies on display, but he hides Alison Astor in a remote shallow grave.
before Alison started in pharmaceuticals, she was a corpsman in the Navy.
she probably witnessed Tara's abduction and tried to intervene.
it makes sense. She was trained to help people.
he hid her body because Tara escaped.
and the anniversary means too much to him to have Alison's body be the one to be discovered.
well, we got our composite sketch. Hey, guys.
check this out.
he grabbed his first victims from here.
he abducted Gina and Phoebe from here.
he buried Alison Astor up here.
and down here in Hollywood is where Tara Rios was found passed out.
we can give it another try, but she has no idea where she escaped from or how long she was wandering.
I'm actually more intrigued by what lies between these 4 points. Look.
dog parks.
there's two of them.
she did say he had a dog.
and there were bite marks on Alison Astor's leg.
dog owners tend to be very regimented.
they follow a strict schedule.
and being out with his dog would allow him to inconspicuously stalk his prey.
those parks are extremely social.
someone out there had to see this guy.
let me help her!
shut up.
don't pretend that you care.
do whatever you want to me, but, please, she'll die.
Shh. Good girl.
give her back now.
what?
she's mine! Give her to me.
no.
Roscoe, up!
No!
I'm not finished with you yet.
please don't hurt her!
Morgan, you and JJ canvas the north end of the park, we'll take the south.
we should make sure LAPD covers playgrounds and walking trails as well.
I suggest we go as far west as Runyon Canyon.
a lot of real estate.
it'll be nightfall soon.
if this guy is planning on keeping the kid, there's a good chance he won't even stick to his anniversary date.
Griffith PARK
the FBI has released a composite sketch of the so-called "Nanny Killer,
who's suspected of abducting and brutally murdering 4 young women up and down the California coast over the past 6 years.
his latest abductees, 23-year old Gina Mendes and 2-year-old Phoebe Payton, both from Los Angeles, still are missing.
if you have any information regarding their whereabouts, please call the AMBER Alert hotline or the LAPD immediately.
Yeah, that kind of looks like Jonny.
do you know him?
Yeah. I mean, not really, just from up here, but...
hang on.
Hey, baby, come here for a sec?
he's up here more than I am.
what's up?
these guys are with the FBI.
take a look at this. That look like Jonny to you?
kinda. Yeah.
do you know where we can find him?
no idea. I used to see him up here all the time.
haven't seen him in a few days, though.
what kind of dog does he have?
a big old Rottweiler.
Roscoe. He plays with Daisy.
do you know Jonny's last name?
no. Just Jonny.
sorry.
is he in some kind of trouble?
Oh, man of my favorite fantasies, what you got?
I need you to do your thing, mama.
look up every Jonny, John, and Jonathan in Los Angeles with a dog license.
OK, there are 420.
does it specify what breed of dog?
Yes. Unless they're mixed breed.
are there any Rottweilers on that list?
not a one.
Oh, Hang on. Not everybody bothers to get a license.
what about vet records?
what about them?
find all the veterinarian offices within a 10-mile radius of Griffith Park.
this guy's got a Rottweiler.
OK, there are 14 vet offices, there are a lot of records.
it's gonna take me a sec. Hold up, I'll hit you back.
that was a good boy.
come here.
turn around.
good boy. Go.
I got a hit. There's a Jonathan Ray Covey who owns a 110-pound Rottweiler named Roscoe.
I've got a home and a work address.
well, who's closer to what?
you're closer to home, which is right next to Griffith Park. You're right there.
go! Go! I'll let Hotch know.
I thought I told you to get to bed!
you're a bad boy.
you don't care about that baby. Just admit it.
just say the word. No.
save yourself. Admit it and it'll stop.
never.
you'll break.
they all do.
I got the skinny on this Covey dude.
he's 40 years old, he lives in the same house he grew up in, which he inherited from his mother when she died 10 years ago.
that's why he's so connected to Griffith Park.
he probably grew up going there.
how did his mother die, Garcia?
heart attack. Same thing with his dad back in '86.
and here's something super sad. When Covey was 7, his 2-year-old sister Amanda was drowned.
how? Bathtub.
there was a nanny watching, a Griselda Vasquez.
there was a full investigation. The death was ruled accidental.
she was cleared of any wrongdoing.
covey must still blame her for his sister's death.
and guess what date she died. May 13.
winner winner, chicken dinner. And here's another piece of interest.
baby sister had asthma.
so this isn't paternal desire, this is fraternal desire.
Oh, and peep this. Griselda Vasquez, she lost her battle with breast cancer 6 years ago.
that's when he killed his first victim. That must have been his trigger.
he never got his chance to take revenge.
just give in.
jonathan Ray Covey, it's the FBI!
his sister's room.
Roscoe, attack!
drop the weapon!
let's go!
let her go! Roscoe!
drop the weapon!
jonathan, let her go.
she's not Griselda!
Griselda? That bitch lied and got away with it!
she didn't care about us.
she just wanted to save her own ass!
but that girl right there is not your nanny.
don't hurt that dog!
jonathan, let her go!
he's gone out front!
stop!
stop right there!
we've got it.
you all right? Yeah.
that was a nice shot.
agent Jareau?
Tara, what are you doing here?
I asked them to bring me.
baby.
come, baby.
Oh...Oh, God.
we got him.
he's dead.
and we saved Phoebe and Gina, too.
you did it.
it's over.
I want to see his body.
guys...
Yeah.
that's enough.
I'll be right back. Ok?
excuse me.
you're Tara?
thank you.
welcome home. I'm in a conversation with my past.
Wow. I missed you, too.
you're gonna wake up that boy.
alone. All alone. Nobody but nobody can make it out here alone.
Maya Angelou.
watch it! Let's keep the water in the tub, okey?
five more minutes, and then mommy is gonna get ready for work.
why did you always go to work, Mommy?
well, um, because there's people out there that need my help.
but I will be back soon.
how many days? - I don't know, buddy. I wish I did.
but I promise I will be back as soon as I can.
and we always keep our promises, right?
Yeah. - Yeah.
OK, well, then you need to promise that you're gonna be a good boy for Daddy while I'm gone.
give me a high five.
we're gonna make a pre-emptive trip to Los Angeles.
this unsub kills on the same date every year. Go ahead, Garcia.
OK. I present to you, crime-fighters, an oldie but not such a goodie.
I give you Rachel Hughes, Melissa Martinez,
Tara Rios, Diana Brooks, and Gloria Clemente.
you guys know the deets. This is news to you, Blake.
over the last 5 years, each of these women have disappeared from a park off the California coast, from as far south as San Diego and far north as San Francisco.
each of them were nannies who were kidnapped while watching kids.
totally unharmed within 24 hours.
but the nannies were found dead, posed on park benches and Los Angeles Playgrounds.
one a year, always on the same date.
may 13. The actual abduction date varies from case to case, but the unsub goes to great lengths to make sure the bodies are found that exact day.
all except victim number 3, Tara Rios. Somehow she managed to escape.
garbage truck driver found her passed out in an alley in Hollywood.
she had no idea who took her or where he held her.
morgan and I questioned her, I even tried to do cognitive, but she was way too traumatized to remember much of anything at all.
clearly she dissociated from the event.
we've contacted her several times over the past few years trying to get more info, but she just refuses to talk to us.
her reluctance isn't surprising.
each of the victims was sexually assaulted and tortured with burning implements for several days.
and then he drowned them in scalding water when he was done.
but no matter where he grabs them, he always returns them to L. A.
may 13 is two weeks away.
Garcia, go ahead and alert the press on the West Coast.
when we land in L. A. Morgan and JJ will take the jet to Seattle and make a personal plea to Tara Rios.
wheels up in 30.
OK, see you guys next week. Bye.
Bye. Miss Gina.
I want to go feed the birds.
you hungry for lunch? We got some Mac and cheese.
maybe you'll actually eat your broccoli today.
you got your hands full, huh? Cute.
what is she, about 2? - Yeah, almost.
what's her name? - Phoebe.
Hi, Phoebe. My daughter's almost 8.
enjoy your day. - You, too.
dad
it's okey, baby.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
it's ok.
just shut your mouth. Don't make me hurt the baby instead.
Hi, Phoebe.
children are educated by what the grownup is and not by his talk. " Carl Jung.
other than their occupation, there's no connection between these victims.
his need to commemorate the anniversary is what's behind it and whatever message he's trying to send.
and what exactly is he trying to say?
well, whatever it is, this anniversary date has to be associated with some kind of long-term stressor.
that date could be anything. Birthdate, death date, a traumatic event.
his first victim, Rachel Hughes, was the only one be both kidnapped and dumped in Griffith Park.
well, the first time is usually the most significant.
newsflash, my family, and how I wish it was the good kind.
another nanny and a kid just disappeared in Los Angeles.
her name is Gina Mendes. She was watching a 2-year-old named Phoebe Payton.
think that's our guy? - I'd bet on it.
I think he's ahead of schedule.
Los
Phoebe's got asthma.
and she needs regular nebulizer treatments.
Gina always carries some, but it won't last.
how long has Gina worked for you? - Oh, about 4 years.
that's a long time. The baby is barely 2.
Yeah. We hired her when we got pregnant... the first time.
I'm sorry, the first time?
I had a late miscarriage, and then we had a stillbirth.
Gina stayed on. You know, we were both pretty shook up, and I travel a lot for work.
so, she helped out around the house.
Gina doesn't just work for us, she's like family.
she lost both her parents when she was a teenager, so it's kind of like we adopted her in a way.
it's true, right? This man, he always...
he always gives the kids back?
Yes, he has.
and they're OK? He doesn't...
he's returned all of the children unharmed in the first 24 hours, either to a church or to a hospital.
Oh, God.
she needs her medicine. She has asthma.
please, let me help her.
you all pretend to care, but you just want to save your own skin.
you're all the same.
she'll die!
she'll die if you can't take the pain.
in their statements, two of the other families said the same thing about their nannies.
she was more than just an employee. She was almost like family.
well, it's not uncommon to form that kind of a bond with your child's caregiver.
but what if the connection they have with the children is what sparks the unsub's interest?
maybe it's not just about them being nannies.
he could be keying in on the relationship itself.
and he would have to stalk them and know their routines well enough to be able to pick up on that.
I'll have Reid and Rossi retrace Gina's steps, and we should interview the victims' families again.
if he sticks to his schedule, Phoebe could turn up soon.
let's hope so.
I just talked to a bunch of nannies over at the observatory.
they knew Gina and Phoebe.
said they're here every, uh, Tuesday and Thursday.
a regular schedule or routine gives children a sense of security.
that would make it easy for him to stalk her.
he knew exactly when she would be here.
she never made it back to the car, which means he grabbed her somewhere between here and the observatory.
broad daylight, public park, LAPD regularly patrolling the area.
this guy's got cojones.
well, we know he's got his own transport. It's gotta be a van or an SUV.
and he's patient. He only kills once a year.
the rest of the time, he's stalking or planning.
one thing's different, though. He's back in Griffith park.
coincidence? - Griffith park spans 4, 310 acres, making it one of the largest urban parks on all of North America.
given the sheer size, coincidence certainly is a possibility.
but he's never repeated parks before.
no, he hasn't.
sea
Hey, Tara. It's been a long time.
what are you guys doing here?
we need to talk to you.
well, you should have called me first.
we did. You never called us back.
you have no right just showing up to my work like this.
we apologize, but this is...
couldn't you just talk to my doctor?
he knows everything that's going on with me.
the unsub took another nanny today, Tara. Her name's Gina Mendes...
stop. Stop it. I don't want to know her name.
Tara, we really need your help.
I already told you guys everything that I can remember.
Tara, that was 3 years ago.
we're hoping that you'll give it another try.
your memories aren't lost, they're just locked up.
we know this is a lot...
but we'll be with you the whole time.
the little girl who was with Gina, her name's Phoebe, and she has asthma and she needs special medication.
and... and Gina, right now she's going through exactly what you went through.
which means if we don't find her, she's only got two weeks to live.
please. Help us.
no.
LAPD's got every church and hospital in the city covered. So far nothing.
maybe the police presence scared him off.
they're only using plainclothes.
even so, this guy has evaded arrest for this long.
he's probably got a nose for cops.
I don't know. He's a creature of habit.
veering off his schedule would be a big departure in his M. O.
he's already veering from his schedule, though.
I mean, he abducted Gina earlier than expected.
he never keeps the children longer than 24 hours.
he's had Phoebe for 28.
I wonder what that means for Gina. Will he stick to his schedule with her?
he returned all 5 of the other kids. Why is he holding Phoebe?
we should consider the implications if he doesn't bring her back.
agent Hotchner. - Yes.
have you heard anything? - No, nothing yet. I'm sorry.
so... so what now?
we keep pursuing the investigation. We leave no stone unturned.
but you said he always gives the kids back within 24 hours.
it's been almost 30.
that's true, that's been his pattern, yes.
so where's Phoebe?
we're trying to figure it out.
have you checked with all the hospitals? - Yes, we have.
well, what about the churches? She could be there.
we're covering the churches, too, I promise you.
so you just don't know a damn thing.
Mrs. Payton... - You should be out there right now.
even my husband is out there looking, putting up flyers.
how can you be looking for her from in here?
I understand what you're going through.
you don't understand anything.
no, I actually do.
maybe we can find a place where we can talk.
agents, I'd like to help, but I can't disclose the details of Tara's therapy.
frankly, I'm surprised she gave me permission to talk to you.
Dr. Berneman, Tara is the only victim who's seen this man and survived.
there's two lives at stake here. We're just trying to get some insight.
well, I can tell you this...
when Tara first came to me, she was suffering from extreme PTSD.
for lack of a better clinical term, she was a hot mess.
she would scratch at the burn scars on her arm till they bled.
she had insomnia, and when she did sleep, she had nightmares.
for a time, she was even suicidal.
I noticed that she repeatedly snapped a hair tie around her wrist.
that's a form of aversion therapy.
when negative feelings about the event start to take over, she snaps the rubber band.
it helps her keep control.
but she's got a long way to go.
are you telling us that we shouldn't be trying to question her?
I'm telling you we worked very hard for two years.
Tara's finally approaching normal.
she's got a job. She paints.
she even had a date last week.
I would hate to put her through anything that might set her back.
all right, doctor, well, we appreciate you taking time out of your vacation.
feel free to call if you need anything else.
thank you, doctor.
it looks like we may need to give Tara her space.
Yeah, well, it's too bad, because she's the only real lead we've got.
I'm at a dead end.
I spoke to the families of the previous victims and they had nothing to add to their original statements.
why hasn't he returned Phoebe Payton yet? There has to be a reason.
I hate to state the obvious, but maybe he killed her.
but why take the time, effort, and risk to return all the other kids just to kill this one?
you know, she could have succumbed to an asthma attack.
or we're looking at this wrong.
what if he's finally found the kid he's really been looking for?
but we profiled him as a sexual sadist with rage issues.
the children have no value to him. It's the nannies he wants.
the first part of that still could be right. Clearly he's a sadist.
but what if the kids are more valuable to him than the nannies?
then the nannies are collateral damage in the hunt for what he really wants... a child.
and somehow Phoebe Payton fits the bill.
that explains why he abducted her earlier than expected.
well, why wouldn't he just grab the children, then?
because he's attracted to the dynamic between nanny and child.
it could also be a forensic countermeasure.
if he only took the children, he would have left witnesses behind.
but what's so special about Phoebe? What makes her different from the others?
the asthma.
hallelujah, this place is dead. Give me a job, give me a job
Garcia, I need you to check the health records of all 5 kids that the unsub returned.
any special needs, any medications.
Okey-dokey artichokey.
everyone healthy as a horse.
that's super healthy. Clean bill. Nothing.
Thanks, Garcia. - Really? That's all?
but I have so many skills to help. Please? Hello?
if his ultimate objective is the kid, then he may abandon his schedule altogether.
which means Gina may not have until May 13.
we need a targeted media strategy. I'll go get Hotch.
we believe we're looking for a caucasian male who's almost certainly a resident of Los Angeles county.
as you know, he operates on a strict yearly schedule, which takes patience and discipline.
which leads us to belive he's in his late 30s or 40s.
he abducts his victims from public parks in broad daylight, which tells us that he's socially competent, fits in, appears non-threatening.
in other words, he's someone you'd never notice.
do you think he'll abduct more victims anytime soon?
it's possible, though we find it highly doubtful.
his schedule seems to be very important to him.
then why hasn't he returned the baby yet?
we think he suffers from a rare psychological disorder called paternal desire.
like its sister disorder, maternal desire, it stems from a deep-seated need to fill an emotional void left by the loss of a child.
we think that loss may be related to some kind of long-term stressor in his life.
and this explains why he exhibits so much rage and violence against the nannies that he abducts.
he's shown little mercy toward his adult victims, but he's been compassionate to the children.
and it's that sense to which we'd like to appeal.
at this point I'd like to introduce Shane and Melody Payton.
these are Phoebe's parents and Gina's employers.
Mr. And mrs. Payton.
please...
if you're watching this or if you know the man who did this, please contact the authorities.
Phoebe's just...
she's just a baby.
and our nanny, Gina, she is a good person. She doesn't deserve this.
just do the right thing and let them go, please.
Phoebe has severe asthma and she needs this medication.
she can't breathe without it.
please let them go.
give our baby back!
Yeah, this is Derek Morgan.
Yes. Can you hold on?
just a second.
go ahead.
Really? That would be great.
OK. Thank you.
that was Tara Rios. - What happened?
she wants to help us. - You're kidding.
she saw the press conference.
JJ, good work. It was your idea to go national.
I'm gonna get them to turn us around.
I just wanted to let you know that we've convinced a witness to come forward.
she's a victim who had escaped.
I realize it's not the news you're hoping for, but even the smallest piece of information could help us find Phoebe and Gina.
in the meantime, it would be a good idea if you could go home and get some rest.
it would do you some good.
no, no, we're not going anywhere.
so, what makes you think that it's gonna work this time?
well, we're gonna try something new.
it's a psychotherapy called EMDR.
it stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing.
it's very effective with PTSD and memories that have been buried especially deep.
what if I can't? What if there's really nothing in there?
there's evidence that suggests we process
EMDR helps link the two.
Tara, we will be with you the whole time.
and you're gonna help us catch this guy. I promise you.
how does this... EMDR thing, how does it work?
first we'll start by putting you in a safe place, mentally, by asking you to focus on a particular image, a memory that makes you happy.
and then we'll start asking questions.
and then when you're ready, we'll have you follow a light that moves side to side.
so, can you tell us about Jake?
he was adorable. Big blue eyes.
he was such a good boy.
when was the last time you saw him?
that day. The day that we got taken.
we went to the park, like we always did.
Jake loved the park.
what's the first thing that comes to mind when you think about that day?
it was chilly. I forgot my coat.
what can you tell us about the abduction itself?
it all happened so quickly.
that's ok. Take your time.
a man came up to us.
I think... I think he had a leash in his hand.
did he have a dog?
Yeah. Yeah, he did.
that's good. You didn't remember that before.
do you know what kind of dog?
no, but it was big. I didn't... I didn't want it near Jake.
he said... he said Jake reminded him of his baby sister.
my baby sister.
you said before he was a white guy. Can you see his face?
no.
but he has a gun and he's... he's pointing it at Jake.
Oh, God.
calm down. Just concentrate on the light.
what happened next?
he hit me... in my face, then I fell.
Jake was crying and...
I couldn't help him. I couldn't do anything.
I... I think I passed out.
I... I...
the burning... woke me up.
he was using cigarettes.
I was tied to a bed.
he kept saying,"can you take it?
and he said if I couldn't take it that he was gonna do it to Jake.
Oh, my God.
OK. You're safe now. Tara.
Jake, he won't stop crying.
help me. Help me.
he says he needs help.
you actually heard the word "help"? - Yeah.
that can't be Jake, Tara. He's too little to talk.
help me! Help me.
no, it was a woman.
a woman? What woman?
I don't know.
help me, please!
I don't know! I need to stop now. I need to stop.
How're you doing? You need anything?
how could that stuff...
be hidden in my head all these years?
I feel like I'm going crazy.
you're not. It's just your brain's way of protecting you.
that's them, isn't it? That little girl's parents?
are they ok?
not so much.
you have kids?
Yeah. Yeah, a little boy, Henry.
how old is he? - He's 4 and a half.
Oh, that's a great age. Who's... who's with him now?
uh, well, uh, right now his dad is at work, so... he's with his nanny.
this is working. But we've gotta keep going.
the answers are in there. I know it.
but we're running out of time.
look, I made you a promise that we would catch this guy.
please help me keep it.
OK, Tara, I want you to focus on the screams of that woman.
where were you when you heard them?
help me! Help me, please! Help!
it was when he was burning me.
did you ever see her? - No.
wait.
Oh, my god, the van. The van...
she was there, too.
can you describe her? - There's blood in my eyes.
she was... she was wearing a blue shirt.
was that the only time that you saw her?
I got out. I wanted to search for Jake, but I couldn't hear him crying anymore.
I saw her.
I saw her in the bathroom...
tied to a sink.
she had blond hair.
and I...
Roscoe, shut up!
I left them there.
I left them both there.
can you think of anything else about her? Her name, maybe?
can you take it, Alison?
Alison. Her name was Alison.
that's what he would call her when he was hurting her.
so if this mystery blonde in blue was in the van with Tara, that means the unsub probably grabbed them on the same day.
he's never taken more than one woman at a time, though.
maybe she wasn't part of the plan.
JJ and Morgan are still working with Tara.
what have you got, Garcia?
what I've got is a promotion coming, 'cause, damn, I am good.
a very blond Alison Astor was reported missing 3 years ago.
she was single, she worked as a sales rep for a pharmaceutical company, she was an avid runner.
she even qualified for the Boston Marathon, which is not easy.
local
all right, call the coroner's office and see if there are any unidentified female remains for the last 3 years.
um, sir, you're talking to me. That's already done.
it's L. A.so there are 12 unidentified female bodies, but only one with blond hair, wearing a blue shirt, and the coroner is expecting you, and you're welcome.
sorry about the wait.
she was way in the back and her possessions were up in storage.
here's the report.
she was scheduled to be buried soon, but every day we I. D. one of our Jane Does.
you weren't able to determine exact cause of death.
inconclusive. She was too decomposed.
found in a shallow grave up in a remote part of Griffith Park.
so she was out there at least a year before she was found.
critters must have got to her, too.
Yeah. They went to town.
you can see bite marks on her tibia, fibula.
they're on her radius, too.
something weird on this leg.
these bite marks here... too big for anything out in griffith Park.
I'd say that's from a very large dog, one pushing 100 pounds or so.
let me help her.
the nebulizer is in my bag.
the steam won't work. She needs her medicine!
he puts the nannies on display, but he hides Alison Astor in a remote shallow grave.
she probably witnessed Tara's abduction and tried to intervene.
it makes sense. She was trained to help people.
he hid her body because Tara escaped.
and the anniversary means too much to him to have Alison's body be the one to be discovered.
well, we got our composite sketch.
Hey, guys. Check this out.
he grabbed his first victims from here.
he abducted Gina and Phoebe from here.
he buried Alison Astor up here.
and down here in Hollywood is where Tara Rios was found passed out.
we can give it another try, but she has no idea where she escaped from or how long she was wandering.
I'm actually more intrigued by what lies between these 4 points.
look. Dog parks. There's two of them.
she did say he had a dog.
and there were bite marks on Alison Astor's leg.
dog owners tend to be very regimented. They follow a strict schedule.
those parks are extremely social. Someone out there had to see this guy.
let me help her!
shut up. Don't pretend that you care.
do whatever you want to me, but, please, she'll die.
Shh. Good girl.
give her back now. - What?
she's mine! Give her to me.
no. - Roscoe, up!
No!
I'm not finished with you yet.
please don't hurt her!
Morgan, you and JJ canvass the north end of the park.
we will take the south.
we should make sure LAPD covers playgrounds and walking trails as well.
I suggest we go as far west as Runyon Canyon.
a lot of real estate. - It'll be nightfall soon.
if this guy is planning on keeping the kid, there's a good chance he won't even stick to his anniversary date.
gri who's suspected of abducting and brutally murdering 4 young women up and down the California Coast over the past 6 years.
both from Los Angeles, still are missing.
if you have any information regarding their whereabouts, please call the Amber Alert Hotline or the LAPD immediately.
Yeah, that kind of looks like Jonny.
do you know him?
Yeah. I mean, not really, just from up here, but... Hang on.
Hey, baby, come here for a sec?
he's up here more than I am. - What's up?
these guys are with the FBI. Take a look at this. That look like Jonny to you?
kinda. Yeah.
do you know where we can find him?
no idea. I used to see him up here all the time. Haven't seen him in a few days, though.
what kind of dog does he have?
a big old Rottweiler. Roscoe. He plays with Daisy.
do you know Jonny's last name?
no. Just Jonny. Sorry.
is he in some kind of trouble?
Oh, man of my favorite fantasies, what you got?
I need you to do your thing, mama.
look up every Jonny, John, and Jonathan in Los Angeles with a dog license.
OK, there are 420.
does it specify what breed of dog?
Yes. Unless they're mixed breed.
are there any Rottweilers on that list? - Not a one.
Oh, hang on. Not everybody bothers to get a license.
what about vet records? - What about them?
find all the veterinarian offices within a 10-mile radius of Griffith Park.
this guy's got a Rottweiler.
OK, there are 14 vet offices, there are a lot of records.
it's gonna take me a sec. Hold up, I'll hit you back.
that was a good boy.
come here. Turn around.
good boy. Go.
I got a hit. There's a Jonathan Ray Covey who owns a 110-pound Rottweiler named Roscoe.
I've got a home and a work address.
well, who's closer to what?
you're closer to home, which is right next to Griffith Park.
you're right there. Go! Go! I'll let Hotch know.
I thought I told you to get to bed!
you're a bad boy.
you don't care about that baby.
just admit it.
just say the word. - No.
save yourself. Admit it and I'll stop.
never.
you'll break. They all do.
I got the skinny on this Covey dude.
he's 40 years old, he lives in the same house he grew up in, which he inherited from his mother when she died 10 years ago.
that's why he's so connected to Griffith park.
he probably grew up going there.
how did his mother die, Garcia?
heart attack. Same thing with his dad back in '86.
and here's something super sad.
when Covey was 7, his 2-year-old sister Amanda was drowned.
how? - Bathtub.
there was a nanny watching, a Griselda Vasquez. There was a full investigation.
the death was ruled accidental. She was cleared of any wrongdoing.
nanny
covey must still blame her for his sister's death.
and guess what date she died. - May 13.
winner winner, chicken dinner. And here's another piece of interest.
baby sister had asthma.
so this isn't paternal desire, this is fraternal desire.
Oh, and peep this. Griselda Vasquez, she lost her battle with breast cancer 6 years ago.
that's when he killed his first victim. That must have been his trigger.
he never got his chance to take revenge.
just give in.
jonathan Ray Covey, it's the FBI!
his sister's room.
Roscoe, attack!
drop the weapon! - Roscoe!
let her go! Drop the weapon!
jonathan, let her go. She's not Griselda!
Griselda? That bitch lied and got away with it!
she didn't care about us. She just wanted to save her own ass!
but that girl right there is not your nanny.
don't hurt that dog! - Jonathan, let her go!
he's gone out front!
stop!
stop right there!
we've got it.
you all right? - Yeah.
that was a nice shot.
agent Jareau?
Tara, what are you doing here?
I asked them to bring me.
baby. Come, baby.
Oh, God.
we got him. He's dead.
and we saved Phoebe and Gina, too.
you did it.
it's over.
I want to see his body.
guys...
that's enough.
I'll be right back. Ok?
excuse me.
you're Tara?
thank you.
welcome home.
I missed you, too.
you're gonna wake up that boy.
alone. All alone.
nobody but nobody "can make it out here alone.
Maya Angelou.
yo, man, something ain't right about this. It's right.
you know who leaves a ride like this in the middle of this street at this time of night, man?
cops. Let's go!
car's too nice to be cops. Man, like you know.
I know more than you. Let's go.
Hey, hold up, hold up.
askin' for it. Let me drive.
you said I could drive.
damn, it's keyless.
that clicker thing must be in here somewhere. You see it?
I'll look for it.
I don't see it, man. Try it anyway.
come on.
Oh, yeah!
yo, you hear that? What was that?
Oh, my gosh, man. Hell, no.
come on, man, we gotta go! Shut up, let me think.
no, we gotta go, man. If we get stopped, I'm not explainin' why there's two dead white people in the trunk. Let's go!
all right! This is what we gonna do
we're gonna dump the bodies, wipe down the trunk, and no one will ever know.
Nuh-uh, man, we gotta go. Come on!
will you look! Look! Whoever did this left the key in her hand.
now, they dead and I'm sorry about that, but they ain't gettin' in my way.
are you down?
Eddie! You down?
Yeah, I'm down.
good. Now grab that thing out of her hand.
me? Why I gotta grab it?
because I'm your big brother and driving is my job, and taking stuff off of dead bodies is yours.
hurry up.
Brendon! Brendon! Let go!
help me... Brendon!
help me! Brendon!
let go of her hand! Let go!
no...
run!
Hey, you.
Hey.
next time I decide if I want to keep working at Doctors Without Borders, please shoot me.
what country are you in right now? Right now, all I see is sand.
so, south... Sandistan, I think.
when are you gonna get home?
they kept me out here for 10 months. Who knows?
do you need to get that?
Mm-mmm. No, not right now.
you sure? Maybe you have to sign for something.
special delivery.
Hey.
this is a treat. You never surprise me at home.
how'd you get the time off?
you can stop faking. When you're really asleep, you do that leg twitch thing.
no, I don't.
what's going on? 'Cause there's something.
why does there have to be something? Can't I just want to make my wife happy?
it's nothing. It's a good thing.
so there is a thing.
Yes. But I've been in an airplane for 20 hours, and we're not gonna talk about this right now.
and I also just heard your phone go off.
that means you've got a psycho killer to catch.
we aren't done talking about this.
Shh. I'm sleeping.
look.
it looks like someone is taking the term "Motor City" too literally.
in the last month,
detroit P. D. has found two different crime scenes in the trunks of two different cars.
married couples in each trunk?
Yeah. Brian and Melissa Cain in car number one, Paul and Elizabeth Garrett in car number two.
Elizabeth was found alive by a couple of kids, but by the time the paramedics got there, she had lost too much blood.
well, it takes a lot of skill to force a couple into their own car, even with a gun.
but once he does, it's one-stop shopping for this guy.
his car become an abduction vehicle and a dumping site.
according to missing persons reports, he holds on to them for about a week.
do you know what he does with them during that time?
Yes, unfortunately I do, and that information is on your tablets in picture form.
and if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go to my happy place.
wow, this guy sure likes to cut, doesn't he?
mostly shallow. They could almost be considered hesitation marks, except for the sheer number.
M. E. puts the count at nearly 50 per victim, and the cause of death is one final stab that's fatal.
physical and psychological sadism. They never know if the next cut is the one that will kill them.
and the amount of urban decay in Detroit gives him a lot of room to maneuver.
we need to stop him before he takes another couple.
Oh, God. Oh, God...
it's ok. It's ok. It's all right. Just hang on.
why is he doing this to us?
I don't know, I don't. Shh. Shh.
Mary, I can't help you.
you have to take it out.
no, no. No, you'll die.
it's time.
thank you.
thank you.
Noooo!
we are not the same persons this year as last, "nor are those we love.
it is a happy chance if we, changing, continue to love the changed person.
w. Somerset Maugham.
so, we know this unsub uses the victims' own cars as his dumpsite.
technically, it's not a dumpsite, it's a transportation disposal modality.
the point is, what does he do once he abandons the car? Walk?
well, both cars were found about 500 feet from public transportation.
he could catch a bus or a train, but back to where?
his secondary location is most likely in Detroit.
both the couples he kidnapped are from Grosse Pointe, which is one of the most affluent communities in all of America, and it's only 8 miles from downtown.
well, then he's probably from Grosse Point, too. To overwhelm two people at once, he has to blend in.
it feels like the real question is, why married couples?
if he's a sadist, having a witness to his torture heightens his pleasure.
israel Keyes kidnapped a husband and wife at gunpoint, got them in a car, took them to a remote location, and then killed the husband in front of the wife.
Keyes was a sexual sadist, though. This guy, I don't know.
cutting a husband and wife to death, it's--it's more like he's mocking their marriage bond.
that's where my head's at.
they took each other for better or worse, now I'm going to show you worse.
so his home life's probably a wreck.
at least one ex-wife, not to mention his mom and dad.
all right, we need to hit the ground running. Reid, I want you working on a geographic profile.
Blake, you and Rossi go to the morgue, cover victimology.
JJ and Morgan, go look at the cars.
we need to understand how he's gaining control of the victims.
near as I can tell, your guy cuts in a mirror pattern.
what he does to the husband he matches with the wife.
except the wife had diagonal cuts downward and the husband's were horizontal.
in their chest and torso, yeah. That gives me a sense of the attacker's height.
if the attacker's taller than the victim, the knife will go down.
but if he's shorter, it'll go in straight.
so the unsub's taller than the wife but shorter than the husband.
wife's 5'4," husband's 5'8," so the unsub's about 5'7."
Shrimpy guy.
wait a minute. Look at the first couple. She was 5'11," he was 6'2."
but the cutting angle is the same. Down on her, straight on him.
well, it doesn't work if the unsub's 5'7." The geometry's off.
I couldn't account for it. Frankly, I was hoping you could.
right. Face me.
put your right hand up.
I'm the wife, I'm 5'4."
stab me in the chest. Bam.
but I do the same to you.
this is why he takes couples. He wants them to hurt each other.
I posted extra patrols around the transit stops like you requested.
good.
and I gave Dr. Reid as detailed a map of Detroit and Grosse Pointe as I could.
so, he should be all right there.
What'd you find?
well, date night is very important to this unsub.
he goes on dates? No, but his victims do, and the unsub knows that.
Brian and Melissa Cain were abducted on a Saturday night.
their last known credit card purchase was at an ice cream shop they regularly frequent.
paul and Elizabeth Garrett had a standing matinee they went to every Sunday.
they were abducted in the early evening, most likely on the way to their car.
he stalks them and learns their routines. Picks couples-oriented activities as his moment to strike.
seeing them happy could enrage him. It gives him the upper hand.
they're focused on each other. They don't see him coming.
OK, then, but how does he get them both into the car? Get in the car or I'll kill your wife.
I could see that once, but twice? Well, let's play it out.
all right.
I would sit in the front seat.
the unsub would get in the back with the wife.
he'd make the wife get in first.
it's just awkward. There's too many variables.
he could lose control at any minute.
somebody fights back or the husband just waits for the wife to get in and then locks the unsub out.
well, what if he was waiting inside the car? It's dark, they're not paying attention.
he jimmies a door. But that would leave a mark.
he didn't leave any marks. All right, well, let's go look at the other car.
Hey, JJ, wait a minute. What?
the car didn't lock.
it beeped. Yeah, it beeped...
but it's not making that locking sound. He's hacking the cars.
that's how he's getting in.
how we doing, baby girl? We are doing terrible. We have another one.
my guys found the car 90 minutes ago.
make and model tells me it doesn't belong in the neighborhood.
what are we, 5 miles from the last crime scene? Less.
what do you know about the victim? Well, the car is registered to Dennis Hammond.
this is his wife Mary. She was dumped alone. He's off pattern.
what about the husband? Did the unsub have a shot at him? Actually, your agents are talking to him now.
Oh, God.
uh, Mr. Hammond, if you want, we can do this at the station.
no.
no, what do you need to know?
can you explain why it took you two days to file a missing persons report on Mary?
I was traveling. I didn't know.
you didn't check in with your wife? We'd been fighting.
about what?
we have a standing Thursday night dinner at our favorite restaurant.
last Thursday my boss told me I had to stay in Cleveland through the weekend.
but I didn't get around to telling her that...
till later that night.
when she went to the restaurant by herself.
Yeah.
so, the victim was supposed to meet her husband for date night and he never showed up.
so the unsub wanted both but only got one. He's been patient and organized up to now.
why wouldn't he wait?
maybe one was enough?
no. He gets off on watching couples.
this unsub wouldn't change his M. O. without a reason.
we're missing a male victim.
pharmacy
Hi, honey, it's me. I picked up your prescription and now I'm on my way home.
I'll see you soon. Mwah.
Hi. Hi.
just calling to check in.
what are you talking about?
you never check in. You're always too busy when you're on a case to do anything.
well, today I am. So...
how are you? I'm fine.
you quit Doctors Without Borders, didn't you?
I did not. Just say it.
I did not quit.
well, then what? Come on, you're killing me here.
the worst thing you can do to a linguist is not communicate.
you knew that when we got engaged.
Alex, they offered me the position at Harvard.
they did? Yeah.
decent hours. Better pay.
what did you tell them?
I told them that I would only consider it if they gave you a position in the linguistics department, and they said ok.
they did? They did.
now do you understand why I was waiting for you to come home so we could, you know, celebrate this thing together? This good thing.
it is. It's a very good thing. It's just...
not what you want. Not right now.
it's taken me 10 years to get here.
not just to get to the BAU, but to restore my reputation inside the Bureau.
I know.
and the job comes first for both of us.
that was the deal. Yeah, well, the deal also came with veto power.
remember? One of us could always say, I want to be a couple again.
Alex... I want to be a couple again.
I gotta go. Let me think about it.
that means no.
no. No, it means let me think about it.
love you.
what do you have?
grosse Point P. D. got another missing persons report.
Emma Churchill. Married?
her husband called it in.
why doesn't this unsub want men anymore?
the condition of Mary Hammond is drastically different than the couples.
fewer cuts on her, but he held her for a shorter period of time.
it's not just quantity, it's quality. The cuts are more superficial.
like he's trying not to hurt her. Until the one final stab in the sternum.
she died quickly. That doesn't make sense.
the unsub doesn't want to kill her quickly. He's a sadist.
why would he do that? He wouldn't.
but whoever she was locked up with would.
you think there's another victim, one that we didn't account for?
you asked why this unsub doesn't want men. It could because he still has one.
based on the ages of the victims, we believe that the unsub is a 30- 40-year-old white male from Grosse Pointe.
up until now he's been an equal opportunity, anger retaliatory sadist.
which is fancy talk for he hates the husbands as much as the wives.
most likely because his own marriage failed in a humiliating way and his wife left him for a man she may be engaged or even already married to.
but a major shift happened with Mary Hammond.
he wasn't able to kidnap the husband, but he needed someone to cut her.
so his M. O. was forced to evolve.
we believe he's abducted the sixth victim, a man, probably someone who reminds him of his own failed marriage.
and he's keeping number 6 alive so he can repeat the process with Emma Churchill.
number 6 could be a surrogate for the ex-wife's new husband or actually be the new husband.
which is why the fastest way to find this unsub is through this most recent unknown victim.
we need missing person reports for all men in Grosse Pointe and Detroit as soon as possible.
even though number 6 was forced to kill Mary Hammond, he may find it easier to cross that line with Emma Churchill.
what the hell...
I don't belong in here!
is there anybody in there?
Hello! Shut up.
Hello! Shut up!
do you want him to come in here? Him, who?
him.
so we didn't see the pattern until we inspected Mary Hammond's car.
we know he hacks the remote. It's not hard.
it runs on a radio frequency. Pretty easy to jam.
20 bucks at your local electronics store.
all right, so the victim thinks she's locked her car.
but she hasn't.
we thought that explained his entire abduction M. O. then Garcia ran a diagnostic On this car's onboard computer.
Hey, baby girl. Take it away, mama. Sir, this guy is creepy clever.
if I may direct your attention to the GPS.
Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.
all right, the map seems to be working fine. When you drive, the map moves with you.
let's see what happens if you look at the driving history.
he covers his tracks, so we we can't find a secondary location.
Yeah. Like I said, creepy clever.
and here is the diabolical part.
when I checked the software's internal time stamp to see when he turned it off, it's the same on every car-- 3 days before date night.
all right, thanks, Garcia.
of course, of course. So he breaks into the car before the abductions.
even his stalking's organized.
but in order to pull that off, he needs access to their cars without attracting attention.
we've already checked garages and dealerships. Nothing matched the service records.
which means there's some target-rich location where all the victims go.
they park, he hacks in. We just don't know where. Yes, this is SSA Aaron Hotchner.
I need to speak to the A. G. please, as soon as possible. Yes, sir, the BAU needs a favor.
and we need it fast.
no.
there's been some kind of mistake.
I didn't do anything wrong!
you can call my husband. He's waiting for me.
did he attack you in your car?
there was no mistake.
I've been in here long enough to realize he doesn't make mistakes.
how long have you been in here? Is it still April?
no. It's May.
may.
he...he gives me clean clothes and food, but...
there's no schedule to it. I can't keep track of the days.
Oh, my God. What's your name?
Emma. Hi, Emma.
I'm Phillip.
begin.
what does that mean? I just want you to know...
I'm really sorry we have to do this. Oh, my God.
agent Hotchner, what you're asking for is extremely sensitive.
we're asking for you to cooperate with a federal investigation.
you're presuming that the 3 different car companies represented in this room track our drivers via their GPS.
that's a bold presumption.
actually, it's not bold, and we're presuming nothing.
when customers access their GPS for the first time, they go to a "terms and conditions" screen.
they scroll to the bottom, they click the box that says "agree" so they can start using it.
they don't realize they've just agreed to allowing their car to communicate its entire driving history with your corporate headquarters.
for research purposes only, of course.
the only reason these people agree to share this information with you is because they don't take the time to read the fine print.
but I do.
we'll, uh
we'll need to consult with risk management. We don't have time for lawyers.
a woman's life is on the line and we need an answer now.
I said, begin.
Emma, I have to come in there.
no. No!
get away from me!
get away!
then calm down. Calm down.
it's not your turn. It's my turn.
Garcia, I don't get it.
didn't the car companies give you the same GPS data?
Yes, they did. But the meta-data has to be translated into latitude and longitude, which is like looking for a needle in a needlestack in a field of needles.
can you match the date?
we know he breaks into the cars 3 days beforehand.
well, that would imply that there is a time stamp on each of the numbers, which there is not, thank you very much.
and forgive my tone, but I am frustrated!
wait.
my mood is changing. We may have a lotto here.
ding. There is exactly one point of common intersection for each of the 4 cars, and I am sending it to you now.
want to take a field trip?
I don't get it.
why here?
access, maybe. He knows the victims will be away from their cars while they work out.
Hey, what if it's a stressor for him?
how so? Maybe
maybe she left him for a guy like that.
he comes here to blow off steam, sees that, it only makes him angrier.
when the unsub takes a closer look, he sees she's wearing a ring.
so he follows her back to her car, and he's picked his next victim.
he's gotten to the point where any husband and wife will do.
that's a lot of anger.
what do you mean, it's your turn? I mean, you have-- you have to stab me.
what? I'm not gonna do that.
then he'll kill us both.
now, I'm gonna go sit down on your cot.
this is some sort of trick. No.
it's better if I sit. In case I pass out.
you have until I count to 3. Ignore him and do what I say.
just do it, right here. It won't even hurt.
2... Just do it, ok? Just right here, Emma.
Oh, God!
3. Please.
there, see? You did it.
do it again.
what? No!
again. No!
no, please.
what's your husband's name?
let go! Let go!
my wife's name is Maya.
I say her name to remind myself why I'm still alive. Stop, please, don't!
what's his name, Emma? Please, what's his name?
say his name. His name is John.
you're doing this for John.
all right, so the unsub's using the track as his hunting ground, which means he found number 6 there, too.
and that victim would have pushed his button in a special way.
you think he could be one of the trainers?
none of the missing men are particularly athletic.
so a regular old fitness buff, then.
worked out at the track, just happened to talk to the wrong unsub.
well, JJ and I like Phillip Connor.
this guy. How come?
well, for starters, his mother reported him missing just after Mary Hammond disappeared.
and when I spoke to his mom, she told me that he and his wife Maya got engaged while she was still married to another man.
that would push the unsub's buttons, all right. Keep digging into Phillip Connor.
if he is number 6, then he'll lead us to the unsub.
I'm gonna need one more.
Oh, yes.
so you and John, how'd you guys meet?
I'd rather not say.
Yeah.
might as well. We're gonna be here a while.
OK. You first.
when I started dating Maya, she was already...
you know. With somebody.
married to somebody. Oh.
it was awkward when he did the whole round of meet the friends.
they'd ask, so how did you guys meet?
we'd be like... Well...
it was a Christian dating website.
so you met online. What's the big-- I'm not Christian. I'm Jewish.
technically. Technically.
genetically. But I've never set foot in a synagogue.
how'd you break that to John? I haven't.
yet.
get back in your cell.
don't. Don't go.
it's ok. We can still talk through the glass.
come here.
listen carefully. There's a way out of here.
you don't want me to-- No.
you want to talk about what's bothering you?
no. Nothing's bothering me. Something's bothering you.
I can always tell when you're bothered because you whisper lyrics to yourself.
hip hop specifically.
I thought it was odd at first, but then I remembered your dissertation was on the fluidity of metaphor.
you seem to have a particular fondness for nas.
how did you know?
morgan made me listen to him when we started working together.
he said anybody that can't quote "illmatic" is ignorant.
So...Do you want to talk about it?
Oh. The text, it's from my husband.
is that a bad thing? He just wants to know if I've thought about his offer.
what offer?
to teach with him at Harvard. How would you tea
Yeah.
tough call. What do you think you're gonna do?
when we got married, part of the attraction was that we were both obsessed with our work, and for a while that was ok.
Yeah, the last time we talked about it, you seemed to prefer it. Oh, not anymore.
I don't like going home to an empty house.
may I offer some advice? Sure.
we need to turn around. You just passed the house.
that's not the advice, though.
Blake, for the last 10 years, this job has been my life.
and then, for a few months,
I had a taste of what you have.
so, work...
there's always work, and there'll always be work.
what's rare is finding someone who makes us happy.
Yes, my son went to that track.
did he ever talk about who he met there, maybe someone who took a particular interest in him and Maya?
Mrs. Connor?
he didn't go there to exercise.
he went there to watch Maya.
why would he watch his own wife?
after they married, Phillip started to get, uh...
funny.
he kept saying to me, if she cheated with me, she'll cheat on me, Mom.
did she cheat on him? No.
but she had had enough.
they're not divorced, but they are separated.
and I can't say I blame her.
my son is sick. He enjoys being sick.
it makes people pay attention to him.
we need to talk to Maya as soon as possible.
do you have her phone number?
uh...Yeah.
I'll go get my cell phone.
wait.
your son's sickness-- does he cut himself?
h-how did you know?
Emma. Help me.
let me in there. Let me in!
Oh, God. What did he do to you?
punished me for helping you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
it's not your fault.
OK? It's not-- Cut him.
leave him alone!
cut him or I'll kill you.
how can number 6 be the unsub? We profiled a sadist.
that all changed when he had Mary Hammond alone. He found something else that worked for him.
the guy's wife left him because he was a cutter.
so he took those women not because of sex but because of something better.
they validate his obsessive-compulsive disorder, turn it into a shared bonding experience.
then he got to play two roles-- the unsub who tortures and the sympathetic prisoner.
so I just spoke with Phillip's soon-to-be ex-wife. According to her, he lives in a day-rate motel.
he'd need more space and privacy than that. I'm here, sir.
what do we know about Phillip Connor's work history?
uh, he freelanced in the area, mostly computer stuff, that the car company subcontracted out to.
he needs infrastructure. Something he could convert.
Garcia, what work site sticks out as the biggest?
there's a microprocessor plant in foreclosure. Is that the kind of thing you're looking for?
the clean rooms. He could seal his prisoners in there and no one could hear them scream.
we're gonna need a strategy.
if he's got abandonment issues, he won't hesitate to kill Emma.
unless we give him something he wants even more. Can you make that happen?
if I can't, it's gonna be one hell of a bluff. And I need your help.
what do we do? You have to.
you'll die. We don't have a choice.
no. No, we can fight.
we have a knife. The woman before you tried that.
he waited until we were asleep and then-- Then there has to be something.
there is. What?
I've been here so long.
I don't want to live like this anymore.
go, go!
if you don't do it, he will. I don't want it to be him.
if you're gone, what will he do to me?
we could go together.
clear!
there has to be another way. No.
this guy thought of everything.
it's all we have left.
I could do you first.
I promise, I'll make it quick.
what? We're coming in!
Oh, my God, it's him, Emma. Get me up.
no, they said FBI.
Oh, my God, they found us! It's gonna be
no... No.
hit it! Go, go, go!
No!
No! Shoot the glass!
Oh, God.
put down the knife. Drop your guns, or I'll gut her.
Oh, God, help me. Phillip, you don't want to do this.
you don't know what I want. Actually, I do.
you want Maya, right? You want her back.
I could arrange that. You're lying.
I'm not. She'll see you.
but for that to happen, you have to put down the knife.
bring her here.
you--you want her here?
if what you say is true, I want to see her.
OK. I'm gonna check.
JJ, you close?
Yeah.
Oh, God.
Phillip, what did you do?
you came.
Maya, is there something you want to say to your husband?
I'm willing to talk.
but only if you let her go.
Ohh...Oh, God.
OK.
don't make me look at him again!
wait. No.
Maya. Wait.
Maya! I love you!
there he is. John.
you've made up your mind, haven't you?
I'm happy for you.
I'm home.
honey?
Hey.
well?
let's go visit Harvard.
Really?
you're gonna come?
on holidays and weekends.
boston's closer than South Sandistan.
what happened to our veto power?
I know you want to be a couple again.
I want that, too.
but...
I need this job.
and one of the things that made me fall in love with you is that you understood that about me.
James, this is the hardest decision I've ever had to make.
give me your hand.
I took you...
for better or worse...
and nothing is ever gonna change that.
right?
right.
yesterday while we were in Florida a body was found in the desert outside Las Cruces, New Mexico.
a man had his leg amputated and replaced with the leg of someone else.
someone's out there mimicking the crimes we've solved.
Hello, I'm still here.
Zug... Zwang.
it's a chess term. It describes the point in the game when a player realizes he'll inevitably be checkmated.
both the Director and the Attorney-General want to take you off this case.
we know this case better than anyone.
guess what just came to the reception desk for an Agent Jennifer Jareau.
Zugzwang. - Who sent it?
they knew you would be at that phone booth.
what if this is the Replicator?
the original zugzwang taunt was directed at me.
if it's directed at one of us, it's directed at all of us.
first he was chasing us, and now it's our turn to chase him.
this psychopath's message is clearly personal.
you're victims now.
I had a meeting with the Director.
you have no fresh leads. He wants the Replicator classified inactive.
Erin, he's stalking this team. No one's going to give it up.
I know that. And neither will I.
Hey, Hotch, I need an override.
I told you not to all me that. - I need an override.
I can't help you. Thane's got the card.
you know where he is? - I'll give you one guess.
I'm thirsty.
I think you've had enough.
is it hot in here?
Oh, yeah, it is. You're too hot.
who's that?
what do you want, Hotchner? - I need the override card.
I'm a little busy. - Yeah, I get that.
it's a 5g tab. We don't want 'em to walk.
uh, just...
thought I told you not to bug me. I'm not the only one with a card.
Jim's in a meeting. - What meeting?
I don't know. A meeting. You got the card or what?
I need some water. - Yeah, yeah, just a second.
bloody hell!
I don't feel so good.
Sean! Sean, get in here!
what the hell did this?
call 911!
she's not breathing. What the hell are you doing? Call for help!
I do not.
OK, you don't. - Do I, really?
well, just a little. And I'm used to it,'cause Jack can babble all night long in his sleep.
usually he's talking about superheroes, though.
what do I talk about?
mm, you don't want to know. - Aaron!
Shh. He just got to sleep.
I'm so glad we're finally doing this. - Me, too.
I cannot wait to show him the city. - He's so excited.
Mm. What did you think of my itinerary?
um, which page?
Oh... I went all overboard, didn't I?
it's a little ambitious. That's ok.
we'll take it easy and play it by ear, ok?
we'll play it by this ear. - Oh. This one?
I just-- I really want this weekend to be memorable for both of you.
it already is.
it's hard not living in the same city.
I know. But I think we're making it work. Right?
I think we are.
did you forget to tell Dave that you were on vacation?
it's Sean. - Your brother Sean?
Jim Peters. I own the place.
aaron, uh, thank God. Uh...
I got mixed up in something. I need your help.
what happened?
this girl, she died right in my arms. Look, I need to see you.
Sean, if you're a witness to something, you need to stay put.
I'm in Manhattan. I'll come to you.
what, you're here? Since when?
where are you?
club called the Edinburgh. 8th and 54th.
all right, I'm on my way. I'll text you when I'm close.
that sounded serious. - Yeah, with Sean it usually is.
what's going on? - I don't know.
I'll keep you posted. Will you keep an eye on Jack?
of course.
I'm sorry. - Don't be. He's your brother.
Yeah. That's why I'm worried.
I didn't think you could still smoke in New York.
you're not even gonna warm up to the big brother act?
I figured it'd save us time.
how long you been in the city? - Jack and I got here today.
Jack. Wow. I haven't seen him since he was...
3
right. And now he's, uh... - 7.
so this is where you work now? What happened to the restaurant?
that was a long time ago. I'm a bartender now.
what happened tonight?
the girl who died, Anna, cops think she O. D.'d on Ecstasy.
and you think they're wrong?
she-- she was bleeding, out of everything.
my manager wouldn't let me call 911 until we got her outside, and by that time she was already dead.
cops ask you why you waited to call them?
they'd already written it off.
cops said they see people overdose in clubs all the time.
then there are probably other cases like this. I'll talk to them.
there was.
Linda Heying. She died last week.
how well did you know her?
we worked together.
she probably got her supply from the same place.
there's enough of it around here.
and everybody looks the other way.
Yeah. If we want to keep our jobs.
Linda wasn't using. - How do you know?
she was my girlfriend.
and the M. E. reports showed 3 other victims bleeding out over the last week.
Yeah. One in Harlem, two in the Village, all 5 of them categorized as Ecstasy overdoses.
and one of the victims may have been drugged without her knowledge.
ecstasy is frequently used as a date rape drug, but I've never seen it cause bleeding like this.
could it be a bad batch?
well, uh, according to the M. E. the victims had so much MDMA in their systems that it caused their internal body temperature to go out of control.
they boiled from the inside out.
that's not typical of overdose victims either.
we could be looking at product tampering, similar to the Tylenol cyanide poisoning in '86.
and the working theory in that case was that the unsub targeted a specific victim but dosed mass quantities to cover his tracks.
so you're telling me these deaths could just be the start.
Yes, ma'am. I'd like the team to join me in New York as soon as possible.
we're on our way, Aaron. - Thanks.
you're coming, aren't you?
just as a precaution. This team tends to go rogue when loved ones are involved.
rarely do members of the same family grow up under the same roof.
richard Bach.
this is more than product tampering. This is mass murder.
overdosing certainly seems like a hard sell now.
he has to be dosing his victims without their knowledge somehow.
ecstasy can be made in pill, powder, and liquid form.
it wouldn't be that hard to slip something into someone's drink or to convince them the pill they're taking is safe.
so even regular users might not know they're being dosed until it's too late.
why kill in such a graphic manner?
well, he gets off on the spectacle.
it's not just about the victims with this guy.
it's about the witnesses. He incites fear.
which means the unsub is desperate for attention, and he wants all eyes on his work because he craves recognition.
he'll be paying close attention to the media, then.
it allows him to relive his crimes.
you know, the medium of his kill is interesting.
he's picking a drug that's known for its euphoric effect.
it's like he wants to take that happiness away.
he's taking the law into his own hands.
but what about the two who were clean?
Linda Heying and Erik Sullivan's families insist they never touched the stuff.
either the victims are good at hiding the truth or the unsub's killing for another reason.
we should take a closer look and see how they're connected.
Hi. I'm gonna have to try to meet up with you guys later.
this is a bit of a mess.
we've got 11 victims, and Sean seems to be mixed up in it somehow.
well, don't worry about us, then. We'll be fine.
OK. Can you put Jack on? - Sure.
it's your dad. - Hi, Dad.
Hey, buddy. I'm gonna have to be late.
you'll miss the Statue of Liberty.
I know. And I'm really disappointed.
I was looking forward to the boat ride out there.
I'm sorry I have to work, Jack. This is the part of my job that stinks.
it's ok, Dad. If someone's in trouble, you should help them.
I appreciate that. Take lots of pictures for me, ok?
I will.
thanks for doing this. I'm really sorry.
Oh, are you kidding?
I'm excited about a little quality one-on-one with Jack.
go help your brother. - Thanks. I love you.
love you, too. - Bye.
6 kids died at a rave last night.
they bled out just like the others. - Damn.
how well do you know these people you're working with?
Thane hooked me up with the job a couple of months ago.
Linda and I started dating a few weeks after that.
you suspect any of the employees of dealing?
no, but it's not like it's hard to find if you're looking.
and you'd tell me if you were involved in anything illegal?
Yes, but I'm not.
I swear, Aaron.
and you've told me everything?
all right, you did the right thing in calling. I'll you know what we find out.
well, this guy's definitely making a statement.
to us or to them?
it's the drug.
did you and your friends take the same pills?
Yeah. But it wasn't pills. It was liquid X.
I'm just trying to understand why did they take a lot more than you?
why was that?
why would you want more doses?
I mean, it appears that the drug had its intended effect.
eventually, yeah.
but it took forever and the others didn't want to wait.
and how long does it normally take?
an hour, maybe.
but is stuff was different. It took nearly double that.
so your friends bought more doses, thinking the batch they'd taken was weak.
how much more did they take? Do you know?
two vials, each.
do you think you'd be able to describe the person you bought the Ecstasy from?
don't have to. He's right over there.
Thanks.
the delayed onset of the drug caused the victims to OD themselves.
well, that explains why the victims boiled.
the higher the dose, the higher the heat.
maybe it was designed that way.
according to the M. E. report, the Ecstasy was cut with a high volume of methamphetamine.
go for greatness.
Hey, baby girl. I need you to run a search on delayed onset MDMA.
meth amphetamine mixtures.
see if you can find anything about
what? - Double oh to the whoa to the oh whoa power.
there's a drug called para-methox... ish...
Para-methoxymethamphetamine?
Yes. What you just said. PMMA for short.
it just hit the international market.
its street name, which I'm not making up, is Doctor Death.
so coined because the drug keeps killing people.
apparently it's produced with such a huge percentage of meth, it masks the effects of the Ecstasy until the user's already taken too much.
mdma costs more to make than methamphetamine, so it's common practice to mix the two in creating Ecstasy in order to maximize the profit margins.
like watering down liquor, except in this case, the water kills you.
so is this PMMA coming straight from the manufacturer, or is our unsub altering the drug supply to make it more lethal?
thank you.
that was the DEA. They're very concerned.
and they have no idea this is where it's coming from?
no. They've increased border patrol, they've heightened security at the airports.
that doesn't help us if it's being made here.
well, still, if it weren't for your brother, we might not have made the connection.
I have some reservations. - What are you gonna do?
I asked Dave to talk to him.
well, that'll do it.
Where's Aaron?
in cases where family's involved, we like to have an unbiased agent conduct the interview.
am I a suspect? - Should you be?
um, how well did you know Linda?
we used to date. - Date?
you told Agent Hotchner that she was your girlfriend.
she was. Then it... stopped.
you two broke up, then? - No, it's not like that.
well, what stopped, then, the sex?
look, what Linda and I were or weren't isn't gonna help you.
I think you should let me decide what's going to help.
we had a fight. It was bad.
but we were getting over it, getting back to normal.
what was the fight about?
my using. - You're a drug addict?
I don't use anymore. Linda convinced me to get clean.
how long ago was that? - Two months ago.
any relapses? - Not in the last two months.
what was your drug of choice? - I'd rather not say.
you'd rather not say? Are you serious? People are dying, Sean.
it was Ecstasy.
you said you told me everything.
I stopped using. I didn't think it mattered.
it does matter. Where were you getting the drugs?
from Thane. - So you're protecting him.
no. Look, it's not like that. I met him a few years ago.
when I lost the catering gig, he gave me a job.
Thane may be a dumbass, but he doesn't kill people.
does it not occur to you that if Thane has access to the drug supply, he might also have access to the person doing this?
I didn't think
no, you didn't think. What else are you hiding?
nothing!
I didn't have anything to do with this.
I don't understand.
we buried my brother week ago.
well, other people have died, and we're worried to what happened to your brother.
I knew it.
the cops tried telling us he died of a drug overdose.
but you didn't believe them.
Erik didn't do drugs. He wouldn't.
why is that?
our dad used to get high before he'd beat us.
you told police that you were partying the night he died.
Yeah, we were just drinking wine. That's all.
you remember what kind?
not the brand or anything.
I got a bottle of red, he got white.
while you're topping off...
did you wash your hands? - Yes.
you know the rules.
thank you for the world so sweet, thank you for the food we eat.
thank you for the birds that sing, thank you, God, for everything. Amen.
mom! Dad!
ecstasy isn't exactly an appetizer.
you know, Kimberly Sullivan said she and her brother were drinking wine the night he died.
it's almost empty.
do you mind? Thanks.
the unsub wants to increase his body count.
he doesn't care who he hurts.
a startling development tonight in Manhattan where two parents died of an apparent drug overdose in front of their daughter.
bernard and Catherine Hatchitt bled out at the dinner table
federal investigators arrived on the scene when it was discovered the illegal substance was inside the wine the couple had been drinking.
their daughter has been moved into protective custody pending the outcome of the investigation, and next of kin...
I hope you saved me for dessert.
morgan isn't here, baby girl.
Oh. I knew that. That was for you.
tell us you found something.
how about a sequel to "The Grapes of Wrath"?
I tracked the wine bottles both Erik Sullivan and the Hatchitt family were drinking, and look out, 'cause those bottles were in cases shipped to the Edinburgh.
why would someone at the bar drug the wine?
maybe it occurred at the bottling plant.
Yeah. And it doesn't explain the rave victims.
it would if we're dealing with two unsubs.
one who alters the drug, another who doses the wine.
but if someone at the club is spiking the wine, how is it ending up in the hands of two Manhattan parents and one underage boy in Harlem?
Garcia, did any of the wine victims make transactions at the Edinburgh?
nothing that's obvious. I'll keep checking. Beep beep.
OK. So...
we have 5 overdose victims we can connect directly to the Edinburgh, a club that condones drug use.
the answer is there.
let me call you back. Thanks.
I heard about those parents. I want to help.
what do you know?
we think somebody at the Edinburgh is dosing bottles of wine with tampered Ecstasy.
Why? To murder someone?
well, if they know the drugs have been tampered with, yes.
if not, they could be using it as a date rape drug.
does that sound like something Thane would do?
Yeah. I've seen him do it.
but he freaked out when he saw what happened to Anna.
he definitely didn't know.
who do you think it could be?
someone farther up the supply chain. Thane might know who it is.
I could help you find out. - How's that?
I know the guy. I can ask him where he gets his drugs.
then that might tip off the real unsub.
well, couldn't you put a wire on me? I can do it without making him suspicious.
no, Sean. You have no training. I'm not gonna do that.
and if Thane knows more than we think he does, it's too risky.
I'm telling you, I can do this. Just give me the chance.
once you tell Thane that the police questioned you, you'll have his attention.
ask him what you're supposed to say to them if they want to talk to you again.
we need some idea of how the operation's organized.
he's not gonna just give that up.
well, if you create the right circumstances, he might.
the Edinburgh's had a lot of attention right now because of the deaths, and that's not good for business.
and you need to make the situation sound as bad as possible.
Yeah, but won't he panic?
well, without jeopardizing your safety, that's exactly what we want him to do.
even with the spotlight of the investigation, the club still needs to make money.
and that means continuing to sell the drugs.
Thane's already on edge.
somebody's probably pressuring him to make all this go away.
which is why he'll be desperate to know what you've said to the police.
Thane needs somebody on his side right now, and the more that you can assure him you're a team player, the more he's gonna confide in you.
how do you feel?
fine. I'm ready.
all right, good. Let's do it.
you're late, Hotchner.
sorry. Sorry, I got held up by the cops.
you what?
they called. They wanted to ask a few more questions.
Oh, they did, did they?
and what did you tell them, Sean?
uh... I told them exactly how it happened, Jim.
that girl started screaming about being too hot,
Thane and I got her some water, got her outside to cool off, and she collapsed.
you're a good man, Sean.
you understand, we just don't want them shutting the place down.
club like this one closed a few days, we're finished for good.
look, fellas, I like my job.
I'm not about to do anything to jeopardize that.
why did they call you in and not me?
I guess 'cause I'm the bartender.
I don't know, they were... talking about some bad wine or something.
I tell you, it's a good thing I got sober.
I had no idea wine could do that to a person.
I just wish I had known than Linda had started drinking again.
then maybe I...
could have done something to help before it was too late.
that couldn't have been easy for him.
they connected that girl to Linda?
maybe you should dump that wine just to be safe.
Yeah. Hey, Sean. Come with me. Give me a hand.
he know anything?
I'm not sure.
Yeah. Start with these.
you don't want to dump the whole case?
uh, no, just-- just those two.
something wrong?
Yeah. I, uh, I could've sworn there was another case of that stuff.
I don't think so.
no, I'm sure of it.
um, you didn't notice anything missing the last time you did inventory?
no. Everything's here.
no, I'm sure of it.
there was... another case of the Whiteland chard.
I don't know what to tell you, Thane, but if it's gone, it's a good thing, right?
we just have to dump it.
No! No, it's not a good thing. I need that wine.
where is it? It's not here. It's not here!
what did you do, Thane?
I spiked the wine, you idiot.
3 of the bottles were in that other case.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Jim is gonna kill me.
why the hell would you do that?
for a laugh. I thought it was X. Girls love that crap.
Yeah, but it wasn't x, was it? - No, I guess not.
he's going off plan, Hotch. - Get ready to move in.
what was in the wine, Thane? - I don't know.
well, where did you get it? - What does it matter?!
Linda's dead because of you.
you son of a bitch. She was sober and you drugged her.
Yeah, not as sober as you think. Look, I wouldn't if I was you.
you had that Anna girl's blood all over you.
you don't let it go, I'm gonna tell them it was you.
what's that? You bastard.
drop it! FBI. Drop it.
keep your hands where I can see them.
you... - Let's go.
you all right? - I'll wait for you outside.
caught her trying to get out through a grate in the office.
was Peters with her?
not sure. JJ and Alex are searching the perimeter.
Sean
Thanks.
the crash didn't kill him.
someone poured PMMA down his nose and throat.
the drug aside, this is a completely different M. O.
he's no longer content to sit back and watch. Why?
the overkill seems personal.
whoever did this had a definite grudge against Peters.
Garcia's running background and financial records on Sean.
Hotch, you don't think you're overreacting?
he left the Edinburgh for a reason. We need to know why.
you can't actually think that he did this?
I don't, but I can't eliminate the possibility until I know what he's hiding.
maybe we should look at this another way.
we know Thane was responsible for dosing the wine.
that was his own plan, not the unsub's.
he'd put a stop to it.
any way he could.
that was after the Hatchitt parents were killed.
as innocent victims, they were the deviation.
so we were wrong. The unsub does care who dies.
instead of targeting Thane, the unsub went after Peters.
he held him responsible.
he may hold Peters responsible for more than Thane's actions.
I'm gonna have Garcia dig into his life.
in the meantime, we'll use that to find out what we can.
well, Thane... It looks like we have a problem.
yeah? What's that, then?
well, someone's pretty upset. Your club's been dosing innocent women.
OK, that was Thane's deal. He'd been dosing X for years.
but recently it went wrong.
I had nothing to do with that.
you knew it was going on. That makes you an accessory.
look, I think I'd like my phone call now.
you could do that, sure.
or, we could play a little game called "Let's Make A Deal.
I don't want to make any deals without my lawyer.
Yeah, this one you do.
see, this is what somebody did to your boss.
you see, Thane, whoever it is that's out there, he managed to get to Jim Peters outside of his apartment.
the person who did that isn't very happy right now.
and he is waiting, just waiting to get his hands on someone else connected to your club's operation.
and you know what we're gonna do?
we're gonna let you go. - You're what?
what makes you think that if he was able to get to the big boss, he'd have any trouble getting his hands on you?
so, like I said, we're gonna let you walk right out of here
all right. I'll tell you what you want to know.
just...
you have to protect me.
still no word from Sean?
we'll find him, Aaron.
how does a guy who has everything going for him make one self-destructive choice after another?
and then when it seems like he's gonna get his act together, it all falls apart again.
were you two ever close?
he was in first grade when I was sent off to boarding school.
I was the screw-up making bad choices.
but at a certain point,
I realized I could either continue to do that or I could get my act together.
but this doesn't seem to occur to Sean.
I know he didn't show up for Haley's funeral.
right.
and at that point I decided I couldn't make him a priority anymore.
I was done.
Hello, my pretties.
I have seen the wizard and he granted my wish.
Erik Sullivan and Catherine Hatchitt both withdrew money from the same ATM on the day that they died.
that ATM is located in a bodega two blocks from the Edinburgh.
what you want to bet that's where they bought their wine?
good work, Garcia. We'll send Morgan and Reid.
Yep.
What'd you find? - Well, they didn't know names, but thanks to Thane and Liz, we now have a map of the distribution chain.
and then a courier transports the drug supply to 5 drop-off points, where the dealers pick up the product and then sell it to their clients.
and the clients include local clubs and underground party venues.
how many of those clubs were connected to Peters?
two. But only the Edinburgh received the tainted X.
all right, let's find out everything we can about the other club.
how do you expect to stay in business if you open 20 minutes late every day?
I got a hangover. What is it to you?
we'd like to talk to you about your inventory.
we pulled your shipping orders, Mr. Beaird.
it appears you're selling more product than you're taking in.
don't you guys have anything better to do than to harass an old shopkeeper?
Yes, actually we do, so can we not waste any time?
where do you get your extra goods?
private donations.
do those donors include employees of local establishments?
look, sometimes a guy nicks a bottle or the supplies from his place of employment and brings it to me.
if I can sell it, I take it off his hands at a bargain price.
does that include cases of wine?
Yeah. I bought one a couple of weeks ago.
funny thing. The guy came back yesterday and paid the full price for what was left.
strange fellow.
guys, I found something stranger than a time-traveling police box.
what's that?
I ran financial records for all the people who work at the Franklin airport.
there is a baggage handler named Mike Spires who's been making ridiculously large cash deposits to his checking account on a weekly basis.
here's what's weird-- he's been dead for the last 4 weeks.
so how's he still making deposits?
right?
Hotchner. - Aaron.
Sean, you need to come in.
we think you may be in danger from the unsub.
he's targeting Edinburgh employees.
Yeah, I heard about Jim Peters. Look, I didn't kill him.
I know that. I also know why you ran.
of course you do.
just come in so that we can protect you.
it's time to stop running.
solve the case and I'll stop.
if Spires has been dead for a month, he can't be our guy.
why would the dealers keep paying him?
they don't know that their courier died. Someone must have taken his place.
the unsub. He killed Spires so he could get his hands on the drug supply.
who else knew he was a courier? Another package handler?
sure. They must be on the take, too, paid to look the other way.
Garcia, do any of the baggage handlers show a history of drug abuse?
a few minor infractions, but nothing that sticks out.
all right, widen the search.
have any airport employees had a drug death in the family recently?
Yeah. The daughter of Larry Feretich, Megan, she died two months ago of a suspected Ecstasy overdose.
there's your trigger. - Where did she die?
uh... The Obsidian. It's the other club owned by Jim Peters.
he's smart. He avoided dosing the Obsidian supply so we couldn't connect the murders to him.
Garcia, where's Feretich now?
at the airport. - All right, notify Morgan and Reid.
Yeah.
fran
Larry Feretich? FBI.
Larry Feretich, you're under arrest for the murder of
he killed my daughter! He killed Megan!
no, he didn't. A drug killed your daughter.
no, it was Jim Peters. I said so, but no one would listen.
thank you.
that was the Canadian drug agency.
they closed down operations at their airport.
that's a relief. Now Sean can come out of hiding.
he's exonerated. That's something.
well, I don't know about you all, but I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna head back to the hotel and take a bath.
I could drive you. I'm heading that way.
thank you, Alex. So I'll see everyone on the jet tomorrow.
could you be any more obvious?
I think I preferred you before you were a profiler.
Really?
here, buddy.
give me that.
come on in.
Jack, do you remember Uncle Sean?
Hey, Jack. It's been a long time.
and this is Beth.
it's great to finally meet you.
Yeah, well, it's not like we live in the same city or anything.
Jack, how about we go look at all that cool stuff you got at the museum today, huh?
OK.
say goodbye to Uncle Sean, Jack.
Bye. - Bye. I'll see you soon, huh?
so how did you know I took the wine?
I know what you sound like when you tell a lie.
you said something to Thane about the wine, and I could hear you calming yourself down.
my brother the profiler.
it has more to do with being your brother than being a profiler.
what did you get for the wine?
100 bucks. I needed it for rent.
Sean, you and I need to do better.
Yeah, I want to, Aaron.
look, I know what I have to do. Know any good lawyers?
I've made a couple calls.
there are two officers waiting downstairs.
Yeah, I know. I saw them on my way up.
I'll walk you down.
"cruel is the strife of brothers. " Aristotle.
that's not right. Why is that happening?
what...
what-- what
wait -- that's what the...
that's what the Replicator-- that's what the Replicator said.
where is he?
zug
how did he get in my-- how did he do it?
how did he get in? how did he get in? Hey!
wait!
kids! Wait for me!
do you really think your team is going to save you?
I know they will.
did you get everything you wanted? - What?
in life. Did you?
does anyone? - We should. Heh.
that's the point.
drinking got in your way. Your husband couldn't help.
though God knows he tried.
you know my husband?
and your poor children always played second fiddle to your ambition.
I can't see.
Oh, thank God.
David. He was here. You have to find him.
I will. I promise.
thank you.
all the love in the world won't save you.
what?
we're not finished yet.
incoming David Rossy
the Replicator's here in New York.
he took pictures of us and he hacked into Garcia's system.
I know. I will.
I love you, too. Bye.
Hey, Garcia. - Are you guys ok?
Yeah, yeah. I got Derek with me. We're meeting everyone at the hotel.
I don't know how he got in.
I'm gonna shut down the system before the Replicator can.
I am so sorry. I check everything.
I upgrade constantly.
it's not your fault, Penelope. He's just that good.
and he wanted us to know that he's here hunting us.
hold on. You got an external override.
and if the only way to get in is with the pre-authorized hard line and he didn't get in via Quantico...
Oh, my God. - What?
he was in my house.
Strauss isn't answering.
keep trying. Reid, any luck with Blake? - Not yet.
the pictures of you were taken outside of Beth's apartment.
I get it if you want to stay with them until we find him.
I've got agents surrounding Beth's building.
she and Jack are safer without me, since we're the targets.
Blake, we'll pick you up in a few minutes. The Replicator's back.
you've reached Erin Strauss. Please leave me a detailed message.
Hey, it's me again. I got your text, but I guess you fell asleep.
Hotch. Something's wrong.
the window's open. She'd never sleep like that.
did something happen to make her drink again?
No! She was working real hard at
this represents a year sober. She hasn't let to of it since she got it.
she's even a sponsor now.
the Replicator has her. I'll check the roof.
I'll have Morgan meet you up there.
Strauss is missing.
Blake, you and Reid talk to hotel security.
we need access points and footage from every camera.
Morgan, back up Dave on the roof.
JJ, take the west staircase, I'll take the east.
Erin. - Not quite.
does it ever get confusing, that whole Erin/Aaron thing?
where is she? - Closer than you think.
but she's not doing well. She looks a bit pale.
remember the last time you got a call like this?
remember?
george Foyet, right?
you were too late.
Rossi. What the hell happened?
her room was a wreck.
she been drinking?
no.
Rossi, you sure?
look, if the Replicator took her, he's probably long gone.
but he left the window open so we would come up here.
well, then this is some kind of trap or he wants us to see something.
there she is!
Dave! Dave, I've got her!
she's on a bench, she's a block east of the hotel.
call EMTs.
is he armed?
is he armed?
Erin. - I tried to find you.
it's ok. Help is on the way.
Erin, you've been drugged. We need to get you to a hospital.
no, I can't.
it's happening so fast. - Dave's called the paramedics.
he said he's gonna race you home. Does that mean anything to you?
you have to find him.
it's so quiet. Why is it so quiet?
Erin, did you recognize him?
he put a gun to my head.
he made me drink. - I'm sorry.
I wish I'd let him kill me.
did you know him?
no. He knows my family.
he knows my children! You have to protect my kids!
it's OK now, Erin. - You have to find him!
we will. We will. Just take a breath.
I love my children. Please tell them.
they know. They know.
once you said I loved my son the most.
that's not true.
I'm sorry. I was wrong.
aaron, I can't see you.
I'm right here.
I don't want to die alone.
I'm right here. It's ok.
it's ok.
affliction comes to us "not to make us sad, but sober;
not to make us sorry, but wise. " H. G. Wells.
we've got an APB, but the description of the Replicator is too general.
he wiped out all of the hotel security cameras.
ATM and traffic cameras were compromised also.
which means he hacked into at least two dozen systems.
well, he got into Garcia's place, which mean he can get in anywhere.
this guy's bragging.
he also wants us to know he can take massive risks and still get away with it.
it's probably why he took Strauss into a crowd of people.
that and to humiliate her publicly.
but he called Hotch from her phone.
it was important to him that we find her alive.
the Director wants this contained and solved.
well, at least he's not taking us off the case.
he's given us 24 hours and then he will.
I'm taking her back to Bethesda. She never liked this city, Aaron.
I'm not about to leave her.
could you give us a minute, please.
is Jack staying here? - I think it's a good idea.
you're lucky to have Beth. - I know.
her children want to meet me at Bethesda.
how old are they now?
too young for this.
you all right?
she smells of booze, Aaron.
you and I know it's because that bastard took away her dignity.
but her children might not believe that.
it's hard for them to trust anything to do with her drinking.
she struggled with it all her life.
and she was finally beating it.
he knew about Foyet? - Who's that?
he's the man who killed my wife.
that's a classified case that's not in any database.
then how would he know about it?
if he had access to the file, we're talking about someone on the inside.
conference room in 5.
Garcia, is this everything? - Yeah. The Replicator stuff is here, and the team stuff is there and there.
how's Rossi? - Not good.
is he with Strauss? - Yeah.
OK. Uh-- uh, I started with the question you asked
why attack Strauss, and on this day?
the most obvious answer is that it's an anniversary of some sort.
but there's nothing historically relevant.
it could be the smallest thing. Concentrate on New York.
if the date's that important, the setting could be, too.
it would be easier to attack Strauss at home.
is there a reason why he waited for her to be out?
well, considering she's hardly ever in the field, he sure got a lot of photos of Strauss.
it's like he's obsessed with her.
maybe Strauss was always his first target.
he attacked the top of the BAU chain first.
all right, Reid, you've matched up all the murder locations with the dates.
now we need to know how long it would take to drive to each of these locations, assuming a home base in the district.
he brought the fight here for a reason.
I'll collect all the public and private transport stuff.
Garcia, I need Kevin to go through every single pixel of these photographs.
this unsub gets off on taunting us.
he's given us answers here. We just haven't found them yet.
are you all right?
Yeah. She was a good woman.
I know. I'm sorry.
are those her children out there?
her ex is on the way.
you know the family well.
it feels like I do. Through her.
so, uh, when will we get the tox results?
we have them. It's what you expected. Meth and Ecstasy combo.
though it didn't cause the internal boiling like with the New York victims.
a lower dose, or did he alter it?
we won't know until we get the exact breakdown.
I'll let you know the second I hear.
so what do you make of the markings on her wrist?
torture, right? It was done antemortem.
what? - The carving I showed you.
right. Sorry. Can you show me that again?
Dave, a figure 8?
that's what it looks like. I just sent you all a picture.
maybe it's an infinity symbol.
well, if it's infinity, he could be boasting "I'll go on forever"?
or if it's an 8, Strauss was his eighth victim.
and the unofficial eighth member of our team.
if this is a taunt from him, it's too random.
well, he's only sent one message and he seems to be real proud of it.
Zugzwang. - Then what does this mean?
Rossi, the cut looks jagged. Any idea what caused the serration?
best guess is a piece of glass.
maybe he used empty bottles from the mini bar?
those were all plastic. The M. E. is checking for splinters now.
all right, let us know what you find out.
anything from the photographs yet?
we blew up a few more and this one seems to stand out.
when were you in a tuxedo? - It was a British embassy event.
security clearance is high. - Security was insane there.
that kind of accessibility, plus knowing about Foyet, the fact that he was able to get through all of my security clearances alone, you guys are right. You have to trust your gut.
the Replicator has gotta be on the inside.
the Director needs to know the status of the system failure.
give me another few hours.
he's not happy about it. - Yeah, well, who is?
confidentiality
if the Replicator's an insider, is there any way Strauss knew him?
she said she didn't recognize him.
to her defense, she was disoriented by the drug overdose.
she was adamant about it.
well, even if Strauss didn't know him, it doesn't mean he didn't know her.
within the Bureau, she is the face of the BAU.
and clearly a target from the beginning. But why?
more importantly, what was he replicating? - The drug overdose.
I mean with the 8. It hasn't been part of any other case, and he's not one to make mistakes. He thought he was replicating a crime.
the Director made us walk away from the case a few months ago.
Strauss said that she wouldn't let it go. What if she hadn't?
you think she started her own investigation?
well, if she thought he was an insider, she might have done something to trap him.
why wouldn't she have told you about that back in New York?
maybe she didn't have proof.
but her determination, plus the fact that he doesn't make mistakes makes me think that the 8 was part of her plan to catch him.
do we have her laptop?
all the hacking in the world isn't gonna help if they shut us down.
he can't win, not like this.
this is Strauss' laptop.
I need to access who was on the distribution list for my case reports.
you don't know who reads your reports?
I know she sent them to the head of the criminal division and the Director, but I don't know who else is on the list.
the last case she sent in was the case in Detroit.
the Cutter.
she amended the report and said that the unsub cut a figure 8 into his victims' wrists.
but he didn't do that. - No, he didn't.
so she duped him.
which means that one of the people reading these reports has gotta be the Replicator.
it doesn't show who else saw this.
two other people read the report. - Who?
you're gonna need a tie.
agent Hotchner, I have a very full day.
Yes, sir, we all do.
senator, can I suggest that we move this into your office.
there's nothing you can tell me that these walls have not heard before.
how long has the Department of Justice been watching the BAU?
that's no secret.
we made it clear to your Director and your section chief that we were watching your team closely ever since that ordeal with agent...
Prentiss. - Yes.
she's running an office in London and that's a good place for her.
you receive my case files from the Director.
well, agent, that's classified.
sir, it's not a question. I know you're on the list.
I need to know who else has access to them.
I'm not answering that until I get some insight as to what this is all about.
Erin Strauss told us all about it.
he killed last night, sir, in New York. She was murdered.
wh? Why haven't I been told about this?
the Director's keeping this contained.
we believe that this unsub is targeting the rest of us, and we've determined that he's someone within the highest levels of the justice system and he's been reading the details of my reports.
I need the names, sir.
at least this narrows it down.
finding someone on the inside should be easier.
not necessarily. If our unsub was trained by law enforcement, he'd know how to fit in perfectly.
there's meaning and purpose to everything he does.
why did he choose to replicate the Silencer case?
well, that unsub went dormant for years 'cause he was locked up.
well, it speaks to his patience.
what about his M. O? He sewed mouths shut.
it symbolizes keeping secrets. There could be something in that.
he's targeting everyone.
so how does that particular case factor into all of us?
it's the first one Garcia and I worked on with Blake.
Yeah, but the rest of us worked on the Seattle case before that.
right. The unsub who used his kid to bait the victims.
we need to see if he replicated that one.
the system is still down, thanks to yours truly, which I'm horrified about.
I'm trying to get the deets on the Seattle case this way now, literally.
you and I were in London when the other guys spent time in Seattle.
I'm on the phone right now with Jennie from ViCAP to see if that particular M. O. has ever been duplicated.
Yeah, I'm still here.
uh, it would be Seattle, early September.
right.
no, not email. Can you fax it? Fax, yeah.
thank you. Thank you. - I take that as a yes.
before he copied the Silencer case, he was in Seattle weeks after they solved the sadist.
go check the fax machine. She just sent you that replicated case.
Thanks, baby girl. - Yeah. Yeah.
OK. I did something right. I did something right.
I need everybody in the conference room.
a dozen federal employees have read our case files over the last two years.
they all went through the highest levels of security.
each of those names needs to be checked against Reid's list.
we should get them all in here and start the interrogations.
if he knows we're looking his way, he might retreat.
we should also check the support staffs of all those employees.
each one has two assistants, so we're already up to 36 people.
we should start with agents who work a 4-day, 40-hour week, given the fact that most of the murders happened over a long weekend, which means if the unsub traveled by car, no one at work would've missed them.
well, he probably wouldn't fly. It would leave a paper trail.
what's this?
the Replicator's first case was the same as mine.
remember the sadist who made Ridgeway look tame?
in Seattle, so it wasn't the Silencer.
do you think it's a coincidence he started all of this when I joined the team?
I don't know.
Dave's back? Excuse me.
he's only been back a few minute it looks like it's hitting him pretty hard.
well, they were together for the last year.
that's the Director. I'll be right back.
Yes, sir. This is Agent Hotchner.
Hey, Rossi.
you all right? You don't look so good.
get out.
look, I know this has gotta be tough on you
Rossi, what the hell are you doing?
Rossi, put the gun down. Rossi.
what's going on?
Morgan's DNA was on the glass that cut her wrist.
Strauss? - You did that.
no, I didn't.
Dave, someone on the inside is doing this.
you're looking at him.
Derek did not hurt her, and you have to trust me on this.
trust you? I bet you told Erin the same thing.
look what that got her.
Dave, you've been drugged.
I was too late, Erin.
I'm so sorry.
he wants us against each other. If you pull that trigger, he wins.
she's not there.
give me the gun.
I'm gonna call the paramedics.
sit down. It's all right.
they've given him a sedative and they're going to take him to the infirmary.
he's gonna be ok.
how did it get into his system?
the report must have been dusted with whatever he used on Strauss.
luckily the transdermal absorption rate was lower than her ingestion of it, so it wasn't fatal for Rossi.
then this was a warning.
if he wanted to kill Rossi, he had every chance to do it.
if this is his endgame, why is he wasting time with warnings?
he's toying with us and we're playing into him.
he's turned Rossi against Morgan.
even if it was temporary, he wanted to show it could be done.
but why?
Strauss was dosed with a chemical cousin of Doctor Death.
he altered it so her torture would be longer.
a biochemist, computer hacker, and federal agent?
who the hell is this guy?
only half the cameras are working because the system is still rebooting itself, so the security guards have to go old school.
that means everyone has to sign in.
you can't take your I. D. And run it through
well, you know what old school means.
so, if you have a badge, you don't get harassed.
the man who signed in to see Rossi went up to the sixth floor, held the door open for Kevin and Anderson...
I can't believe he was right there.
walked through our BAU into Rossi's office, signed in as Adam Worth.
isn't that the same alias he used when Maeve went missing?
Yeah, which means it's not just a taunt. It speaks directly to his psychology.
Adam Worth was a famous criminal from the late 1800s, commonly referred to as the Napoleon of Crime.
this unsub obviously sees himself in the same light.
so this guy is a malignant narcissist who wants to be known as the worst enemy we've ever had.
and look, he's careful to hide his face from the cameras.
because he knows exactly where they are.
the Replicator has directly taunted everyone on this team except for me.
you may be part of his endgame. - Then so was Strauss.
he chose to use drugs as his final replication.
that's no accident.
is that a connection to you?
Strauss and I had issues during the Amerithrax case.
it started in New York with poison.
and it was delivered by envelopes.
why would anyone on the inside hold resentment over that case?
because that person suffered a professional setback just like Blake, but was patient and psychotic enough to get revenge.
I am all over the DOJ names including support staff.
I have Kevin pulling files and photos.
system is down, so it's hard to check entire career paths, but there were two agents in New York in 2001.
scratch that-- Lehman died in October-- that leaves Curtis.
wait a second? John Curtis?
you know him?
I haven't seen him in a long time. He was a nice guy.
we were first office agents together, but I thought he left the Bureau after the Amerithrax case.
could it be him? Does he fit the profile?
he was quiet and a loner, but brilliant.
he specialized in a lot of fields, but his passion was biochemistry.
he inherited a family compound in rural Virginia.
coordinates on on your phone.
what else do you have on Curtis? - Just like you thought.
John Curtis was demoted in the FBI after the Amerithrax case.
he was slated to take over the coveted New York field office, but then was shipped to the not coveted Kansas City one.
he worked there for many years quietly before he was able to weasel his way back into the nation's capital.
on paper he is a rock star.
he immediately transferred to the Department of Justice, the intelligence oversight section.
he's a genius on multiple levels.
what's his background?
only child, parents died when he was 18. Never married.
total loner, just like Blake said.
then all he's ever had to care about is his work.
and when he lost that, he snapped.
hrt will divide us up when we land.
as you can see from the geo ref'd he's got plenty of privacy.
5 1/2 acres, 3 structures, house included.
I see it, too, sir. It must be some sort of system override.
what's happening? - Autopilot's seized.
Oh, God. - Mayday.
I got it back.
are you ok? - We're stabilizing.
brace for impact.
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
I can't get through to any of them.
we have agents in those choppers.
it was only one. The first is circling back now.
are they ok?
copy.
OK, as a precaution, they separated to land on opposite sides of the property, and the controls were taken over by a remote override.
which can only happen within a 5-mile radius.
he knew they were coming. - And how they were getting there.
are you guys all right? - Yeah.
Where's Blake?
what the hell is this? What is this?
we're back in business.
thank you.
sir. - Where is everybody?
right this second, in a field.
if he'd wanted to kill all of us, he could have.
he's playing God, just like he's done all year.
he hard-landed us, knocked us out with whatever was in those canister he could take Blake.
he had plenty of chances to take her before tonight.
he wants it to be a spectacle.
what do you want?
you're the profiler. You tell me.
you don't want to know. - Reverse psychology.
I'm not going to beg for your analysis.
you don't have to beg.
I already know how desperate you are for it.
I didn't remember you being so skittish.
you've never seen me in chains before?
I've seen you with your hands tied, so to speak.
Erin Strauss and the Bureau discarded us.
we were the forgotten ones.
they forgot you. I did all right.
but they'll remember me now.
you know, I admired you back then, leading the charge on the day it all changed, the day Erin Strauss ruined us.
I sat next to you.
borrowed your pen to sign my transfer.
they put me in Kansas. Me.
you know what I've been wondering?
why did Strauss change her mind about you?
I kept my head down and I worked hard.
we all did.
but you got my chance.
we're ready to breach the house.
which way did he go? - I don't know.
Morgan, you and JJ find him. We've got this.
he said he used 8 locks because there used to be 8 of us.
that's all he said? - About that, yes.
there's only 6 keys. That mean two keys will be used twice.
each key is a letter, likely corresponds to a number on the locks.
7-- seventh letter of the alphabet's "G."
what are the other letters?
um, Z,U, W-- Zugzwang.
it's too easy.
solvant
he's got the placed lined with C-4. We've only got 3 minutes.
this seems too easy.
zugzwang almost means a dilemma in chess where the best move is not to move at all.
wait, don't get up!
it's a pressure sensor.
signal - They've gotta hurry. - Sir, I can't block this thing off for long.
drop the gun.
you'd really die for them?
that's the oath we all took.
to protect our country from people like you, no matter what.
you never appreciated me, none of you.
I gave you my life, and you rejected me.
you can tell me your sob story while walking.
everybody get back! There's C-4 in the basement.
everybody back!
wait, where's Rossi?
he was right behind me. - Dave!
he just let us out. Why would he go back in?
we'll go out as heroes.
I'm not so sure about that.
Zugzwang.
it had to be a perfect round.
and sure enough, coming right back at me was the target.
and it was blasted right through the chest.
the goggles come off... and it's Strauss.
I mean, I was like, what?
I would have never believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.
that woman...
she was one hell of a shot.
do you guys remember that one time that she called me, but I thought that it was somebody else?
Oh, no. - That was funny.
Oh, maybe to you. I was mortified.
what did you say? - I said,"Talk dirty to me."
Yes, she did. That's my girl.
are you kidding?
Hey, that was my line.
whatever are you doing here?
last year, right here, we had a...
very different celebration.
of life, of love, and good people.
this year it's the, uh, other side of that.
because, well... that's what families do.
it's been a hard year.
but tonight...
we celebrate a life well lived...
well loved...
to a good woman...
an even better mother...
to our friend...
who I will miss very much.

yesterday while we were in Florida a body was found in the desert outside Las Cruces, New Mexico.
a man had his leg amputated and replaced with the leg of someone else.
someone's out there mimicking the crimes we've solved.
Hello, I'm still here.
Zug... Zwang.
it's a chess term. It describes the point in the game when a player realizes he'll inevitably be checkmated.
both the Director and the Attorney-General want to take you off this case.
we know this case better than anyone.
guess what just came to the reception desk for an Agent Jennifer Jareau.
Zugzwang. - Who sent it?
they knew you would be at that phone booth.
what if this is the Replicator?
the original zugzwang taunt was directed at me.
if it's directed at one of us, it's directed at all of us.
first he was chasing us, and now it's our turn to chase him.
this psychopath's message is clearly personal.
you're victims now.
I had a meeting with the Director.
you have no fresh leads. He wants the Replicator classified inactive.
Erin, he's stalking this team. No one's going to give it up.
I know that. And neither will I.
Hey, Hotch, I need an override.
I told you not to all me that. - I need an override.
I can't help you. Thane's got the card.
you know where he is? - I'll give you one guess.
I'm thirsty.
I think you've had enough.
is it hot in here?
Oh, yeah, it is. You're too hot.
who's that?
what do you want, Hotchner? - I need the override card.
I'm a little busy. - Yeah, I get that.
it's a 5g tab. We don't want 'em to walk.
uh, just...
thought I told you not to bug me. I'm not the only one with a card.
Jim's in a meeting. - What meeting?
I don't know. A meeting. You got the card or what?
I need some water. - Yeah, yeah, just a second.
bloody hell!
I don't feel so good.
Sean! Sean, get in here!
what the hell did this?
call 911!
she's not breathing. What the hell are you doing? Call for help!
I do not.
OK, you don't. - Do I, really?
well, just a little. And I'm used to it,'cause Jack can babble all night long in his sleep.
usually he's talking about superheroes, though.
what do I talk about?
mm, you don't want to know. - Aaron!
Shh. He just got to sleep.
I'm so glad we're finally doing this. - Me, too.
I cannot wait to show him the city. - He's so excited.
Mm. What did you think of my itinerary?
um, which page?
Oh... I went all overboard, didn't I?
it's a little ambitious. That's ok.
we'll take it easy and play it by ear, ok?
we'll play it by this ear. - Oh. This one?
I just-- I really want this weekend to be memorable for both of you.
it already is.
it's hard not living in the same city.
I know. But I think we're making it work. Right?
I think we are.
did you forget to tell Dave that you were on vacation?
it's Sean. - Your brother Sean?
Jim Peters. I own the place.
aaron, uh, thank God. Uh...
I got mixed up in something. I need your help.
what happened?
this girl, she died right in my arms. Look, I need to see you.
Sean, if you're a witness to something, you need to stay put.
I'm in Manhattan. I'll come to you.
what, you're here? Since when?
where are you?
club called the Edinburgh. 8th and 54th.
all right, I'm on my way. I'll text you when I'm close.
that sounded serious. - Yeah, with Sean it usually is.
what's going on? - I don't know.
I'll keep you posted. Will you keep an eye on Jack?
of course.
I'm sorry. - Don't be. He's your brother.
Yeah. That's why I'm worried.
I didn't think you could still smoke in New York.
you're not even gonna warm up to the big brother act?
I figured it'd save us time.
how long you been in the city? - Jack and I got here today.
Jack. Wow. I haven't seen him since he was...
3
right. And now he's, uh... - 7.
so this is where you work now? What happened to the restaurant?
that was a long time ago. I'm a bartender now.
what happened tonight?
the girl who died, Anna, cops think she O. D.'d on Ecstasy.
and you think they're wrong?
she-- she was bleeding, out of everything.
my manager wouldn't let me call 911 until we got her outside, and by that time she was already dead.
cops ask you why you waited to call them?
they'd already written it off.
cops said they see people overdose in clubs all the time.
then there are probably other cases like this. I'll talk to them.
there was.
Linda Heying. She died last week.
how well did you know her?
we worked together.
she probably got her supply from the same place.
there's enough of it around here.
and everybody looks the other way.
Yeah. If we want to keep our jobs.
Linda wasn't using. - How do you know?
she was my girlfriend.
and the M. E. reports showed 3 other victims bleeding out over the last week.
Yeah. One in Harlem, two in the Village, all 5 of them categorized as Ecstasy overdoses.
and one of the victims may have been drugged without her knowledge.
ecstasy is frequently used as a date rape drug, but I've never seen it cause bleeding like this.
could it be a bad batch?
well, uh, according to the M. E. the victims had so much MDMA in their systems that it caused their internal body temperature to go out of control.
they boiled from the inside out.
that's not typical of overdose victims either.
we could be looking at product tampering, similar to the Tylenol cyanide poisoning in '86.
and the working theory in that case was that the unsub targeted a specific victim but dosed mass quantities to cover his tracks.
so you're telling me these deaths could just be the start.
Yes, ma'am. I'd like the team to join me in New York as soon as possible.
we're on our way, Aaron. - Thanks.
you're coming, aren't you?
just as a precaution. This team tends to go rogue when loved ones are involved.
rarely do members of the same family grow up under the same roof.
richard Bach.
this is more than product tampering. This is mass murder.
overdosing certainly seems like a hard sell now.
he has to be dosing his victims without their knowledge somehow.
ecstasy can be made in pill, powder, and liquid form.
it wouldn't be that hard to slip something into someone's drink or to convince them the pill they're taking is safe.
so even regular users might not know they're being dosed until it's too late.
why kill in such a graphic manner?
well, he gets off on the spectacle.
it's not just about the victims with this guy.
it's about the witnesses. He incites fear.
which means the unsub is desperate for attention, and he wants all eyes on his work because he craves recognition.
he'll be paying close attention to the media, then.
it allows him to relive his crimes.
you know, the medium of his kill is interesting.
he's picking a drug that's known for its euphoric effect.
it's like he wants to take that happiness away.
he's taking the law into his own hands.
but what about the two who were clean?
Linda Heying and Erik Sullivan's families insist they never touched the stuff.
either the victims are good at hiding the truth or the unsub's killing for another reason.
we should take a closer look and see how they're connected.
Hi. I'm gonna have to try to meet up with you guys later.
this is a bit of a mess.
we've got 11 victims, and Sean seems to be mixed up in it somehow.
well, don't worry about us, then. We'll be fine.
OK. Can you put Jack on? - Sure.
it's your dad. - Hi, Dad.
Hey, buddy. I'm gonna have to be late.
you'll miss the Statue of Liberty.
I know. And I'm really disappointed.
I was looking forward to the boat ride out there.
I'm sorry I have to work, Jack. This is the part of my job that stinks.
it's ok, Dad. If someone's in trouble, you should help them.
I appreciate that. Take lots of pictures for me, ok?
I will.
thanks for doing this. I'm really sorry.
Oh, are you kidding?
I'm excited about a little quality one-on-one with Jack.
go help your brother. - Thanks. I love you.
love you, too. - Bye.
6 kids died at a rave last night.
they bled out just like the others. - Damn.
how well do you know these people you're working with?
Thane hooked me up with the job a couple of months ago.
Linda and I started dating a few weeks after that.
you suspect any of the employees of dealing?
no, but it's not like it's hard to find if you're looking.
and you'd tell me if you were involved in anything illegal?
Yes, but I'm not.
I swear, Aaron.
and you've told me everything?
all right, you did the right thing in calling. I'll you know what we find out.
well, this guy's definitely making a statement.
to us or to them?
it's the drug.
did you and your friends take the same pills?
Yeah. But it wasn't pills. It was liquid X.
I'm just trying to understand why did they take a lot more than you?
why was that?
why would you want more doses?
I mean, it appears that the drug had its intended effect.
eventually, yeah.
but it took forever and the others didn't want to wait.
and how long does it normally take?
an hour, maybe.
but is stuff was different. It took nearly double that.
so your friends bought more doses, thinking the batch they'd taken was weak.
how much more did they take? Do you know?
two vials, each.
do you think you'd be able to describe the person you bought the Ecstasy from?
don't have to. He's right over there.
Thanks.
the delayed onset of the drug caused the victims to OD themselves.
well, that explains why the victims boiled.
the higher the dose, the higher the heat.
maybe it was designed that way.
according to the M. E. report, the Ecstasy was cut with a high volume of methamphetamine.
go for greatness.
Hey, baby girl. I need you to run a search on delayed onset MDMA.
meth amphetamine mixtures.
see if you can find anything about
what? - Double oh to the whoa to the oh whoa power.
there's a drug called para-methox... ish...
Para-methoxymethamphetamine?
Yes. What you just said. PMMA for short.
it just hit the international market.
its street name, which I'm not making up, is Doctor Death.
so coined because the drug keeps killing people.
apparently it's produced with such a huge percentage of meth, it masks the effects of the Ecstasy until the user's already taken too much.
mdma costs more to make than methamphetamine, so it's common practice to mix the two in creating Ecstasy in order to maximize the profit margins.
like watering down liquor, except in this case, the water kills you.
so is this PMMA coming straight from the manufacturer, or is our unsub altering the drug supply to make it more lethal?
thank you.
that was the DEA. They're very concerned.
and they have no idea this is where it's coming from?
no. They've increased border patrol, they've heightened security at the airports.
that doesn't help us if it's being made here.
well, still, if it weren't for your brother, we might not have made the connection.
I have some reservations. - What are you gonna do?
I asked Dave to talk to him.
well, that'll do it.
Where's Aaron?
in cases where family's involved, we like to have an unbiased agent conduct the interview.
am I a suspect? - Should you be?
um, how well did you know Linda?
we used to date. - Date?
you told Agent Hotchner that she was your girlfriend.
she was. Then it... stopped.
you two broke up, then? - No, it's not like that.
well, what stopped, then, the sex?
look, what Linda and I were or weren't isn't gonna help you.
I think you should let me decide what's going to help.
we had a fight. It was bad.
but we were getting over it, getting back to normal.
what was the fight about?
my using. - You're a drug addict?
I don't use anymore. Linda convinced me to get clean.
how long ago was that? - Two months ago.
any relapses? - Not in the last two months.
what was your drug of choice? - I'd rather not say.
you'd rather not say? Are you serious? People are dying, Sean.
it was Ecstasy.
you said you told me everything.
I stopped using. I didn't think it mattered.
it does matter. Where were you getting the drugs?
from Thane. - So you're protecting him.
no. Look, it's not like that. I met him a few years ago.
when I lost the catering gig, he gave me a job.
Thane may be a dumbass, but he doesn't kill people.
does it not occur to you that if Thane has access to the drug supply, he might also have access to the person doing this?
I didn't think
no, you didn't think. What else are you hiding?
nothing!
I didn't have anything to do with this.
I don't understand.
we buried my brother week ago.
well, other people have died, and we're worried to what happened to your brother.
I knew it.
the cops tried telling us he died of a drug overdose.
but you didn't believe them.
Erik didn't do drugs. He wouldn't.
why is that?
our dad used to get high before he'd beat us.
you told police that you were partying the night he died.
Yeah, we were just drinking wine. That's all.
you remember what kind?
not the brand or anything.
I got a bottle of red, he got white.
while you're topping off...
did you wash your hands? - Yes.
you know the rules.
thank you for the world so sweet, thank you for the food we eat.
thank you for the birds that sing, thank you, God, for everything. Amen.
mom! Dad!
ecstasy isn't exactly an appetizer.
you know, Kimberly Sullivan said she and her brother were drinking wine the night he died.
it's almost empty.
do you mind? Thanks.
the unsub wants to increase his body count.
he doesn't care who he hurts.
a startling development tonight in Manhattan where two parents died of an apparent drug overdose in front of their daughter.
bernard and Catherine Hatchitt bled out at the dinner table
federal investigators arrived on the scene when it was discovered the illegal substance was inside the wine the couple had been drinking.
their daughter has been moved into protective custody pending the outcome of the investigation, and next of kin...
I hope you saved me for dessert.
morgan isn't here, baby girl.
Oh. I knew that. That was for you.
tell us you found something.
how about a sequel to "The Grapes of Wrath"?
I tracked the wine bottles both Erik Sullivan and the Hatchitt family were drinking, and look out, 'cause those bottles were in cases shipped to the Edinburgh.
why would someone at the bar drug the wine?
maybe it occurred at the bottling plant.
Yeah. And it doesn't explain the rave victims.
it would if we're dealing with two unsubs.
one who alters the drug, another who doses the wine.
but if someone at the club is spiking the wine, how is it ending up in the hands of two Manhattan parents and one underage boy in Harlem?
Garcia, did any of the wine victims make transactions at the Edinburgh?
nothing that's obvious. I'll keep checking. Beep beep.
OK. So...
we have 5 overdose victims we can connect directly to the Edinburgh, a club that condones drug use.
the answer is there.
let me call you back. Thanks.
I heard about those parents. I want to help.
what do you know?
we think somebody at the Edinburgh is dosing bottles of wine with tampered Ecstasy.
Why? To murder someone?
well, if they know the drugs have been tampered with, yes.
if not, they could be using it as a date rape drug.
does that sound like something Thane would do?
Yeah. I've seen him do it.
but he freaked out when he saw what happened to Anna.
he definitely didn't know.
who do you think it could be?
someone farther up the supply chain. Thane might know who it is.
I could help you find out. - How's that?
I know the guy. I can ask him where he gets his drugs.
then that might tip off the real unsub.
well, couldn't you put a wire on me? I can do it without making him suspicious.
no, Sean. You have no training. I'm not gonna do that.
and if Thane knows more than we think he does, it's too risky.
I'm telling you, I can do this. Just give me the chance.
once you tell Thane that the police questioned you, you'll have his attention.
ask him what you're supposed to say to them if they want to talk to you again.
we need some idea of how the operation's organized.
he's not gonna just give that up.
well, if you create the right circumstances, he might.
the Edinburgh's had a lot of attention right now because of the deaths, and that's not good for business.
and you need to make the situation sound as bad as possible.
Yeah, but won't he panic?
well, without jeopardizing your safety, that's exactly what we want him to do.
even with the spotlight of the investigation, the club still needs to make money.
and that means continuing to sell the drugs.
Thane's already on edge.
somebody's probably pressuring him to make all this go away.
which is why he'll be desperate to know what you've said to the police.
Thane needs somebody on his side right now, and the more that you can assure him you're a team player, the more he's gonna confide in you.
how do you feel?
fine. I'm ready.
all right, good. Let's do it.
you're late, Hotchner.
sorry. Sorry, I got held up by the cops.
you what?
they called. They wanted to ask a few more questions.
Oh, they did, did they?
and what did you tell them, Sean?
uh... I told them exactly how it happened, Jim.
that girl started screaming about being too hot,
Thane and I got her some water, got her outside to cool off, and she collapsed.
you're a good man, Sean.
you understand, we just don't want them shutting the place down.
club like this one closed a few days, we're finished for good.
look, fellas, I like my job.
I'm not about to do anything to jeopardize that.
why did they call you in and not me?
I guess 'cause I'm the bartender.
I don't know, they were... talking about some bad wine or something.
I tell you, it's a good thing I got sober.
I had no idea wine could do that to a person.
I just wish I had known than Linda had started drinking again.
then maybe I...
could have done something to help before it was too late.
that couldn't have been easy for him.
they connected that girl to Linda?
maybe you should dump that wine just to be safe.
Yeah. Hey, Sean. Come with me. Give me a hand.
he know anything?
I'm not sure.
Yeah. Start with these.
you don't want to dump the whole case?
uh, no, just-- just those two.
something wrong?
Yeah. I, uh, I could've sworn there was another case of that stuff.
I don't think so.
no, I'm sure of it.
um, you didn't notice anything missing the last time you did inventory?
no. Everything's here.
no, I'm sure of it.
there was... another case of the Whiteland chard.
I don't know what to tell you, Thane, but if it's gone, it's a good thing, right?
we just have to dump it.
No! No, it's not a good thing. I need that wine.
where is it? It's not here. It's not here!
what did you do, Thane?
I spiked the wine, you idiot.
3 of the bottles were in that other case.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Jim is gonna kill me.
why the hell would you do that?
for a laugh. I thought it was X. Girls love that crap.
Yeah, but it wasn't x, was it? - No, I guess not.
he's going off plan, Hotch. - Get ready to move in.
what was in the wine, Thane? - I don't know.
well, where did you get it? - What does it matter?!
Linda's dead because of you.
you son of a bitch. She was sober and you drugged her.
Yeah, not as sober as you think. Look, I wouldn't if I was you.
you had that Anna girl's blood all over you.
you don't let it go, I'm gonna tell them it was you.
what's that? You bastard.
drop it! FBI. Drop it.
keep your hands where I can see them.
you... - Let's go.
you all right? - I'll wait for you outside.
caught her trying to get out through a grate in the office.
was Peters with her?
not sure. JJ and Alex are searching the perimeter.
Sean
Thanks.
the crash didn't kill him.
someone poured PMMA down his nose and throat.
the drug aside, this is a completely different M. O.
he's no longer content to sit back and watch. Why?
the overkill seems personal.
whoever did this had a definite grudge against Peters.
Garcia's running background and financial records on Sean.
Hotch, you don't think you're overreacting?
he left the Edinburgh for a reason. We need to know why.
you can't actually think that he did this?
I don't, but I can't eliminate the possibility until I know what he's hiding.
maybe we should look at this another way.
we know Thane was responsible for dosing the wine.
that was his own plan, not the unsub's.
he'd put a stop to it.
any way he could.
that was after the Hatchitt parents were killed.
as innocent victims, they were the deviation.
so we were wrong. The unsub does care who dies.
instead of targeting Thane, the unsub went after Peters.
he held him responsible.
he may hold Peters responsible for more than Thane's actions.
I'm gonna have Garcia dig into his life.
in the meantime, we'll use that to find out what we can.
well, Thane... It looks like we have a problem.
yeah? What's that, then?
well, someone's pretty upset. Your club's been dosing innocent women.
OK, that was Thane's deal. He'd been dosing X for years.
but recently it went wrong.
I had nothing to do with that.
you knew it was going on. That makes you an accessory.
look, I think I'd like my phone call now.
you could do that, sure.
or, we could play a little game called "Let's Make A Deal.
I don't want to make any deals without my lawyer.
Yeah, this one you do.
see, this is what somebody did to your boss.
you see, Thane, whoever it is that's out there, he managed to get to Jim Peters outside of his apartment.
the person who did that isn't very happy right now.
and he is waiting, just waiting to get his hands on someone else connected to your club's operation.
and you know what we're gonna do?
we're gonna let you go. - You're what?
what makes you think that if he was able to get to the big boss, he'd have any trouble getting his hands on you?
so, like I said, we're gonna let you walk right out of here
all right. I'll tell you what you want to know.
just...
you have to protect me.
still no word from Sean?
we'll find him, Aaron.
how does a guy who has everything going for him make one self-destructive choice after another?
and then when it seems like he's gonna get his act together, it all falls apart again.
were you two ever close?
he was in first grade when I was sent off to boarding school.
I was the screw-up making bad choices.
but at a certain point,
I realized I could either continue to do that or I could get my act together.
but this doesn't seem to occur to Sean.
I know he didn't show up for Haley's funeral.
right.
and at that point I decided I couldn't make him a priority anymore.
I was done.
Hello, my pretties.
I have seen the wizard and he granted my wish.
Erik Sullivan and Catherine Hatchitt both withdrew money from the same ATM on the day that they died.
that ATM is located in a bodega two blocks from the Edinburgh.
what you want to bet that's where they bought their wine?
good work, Garcia. We'll send Morgan and Reid.
Yep.
What'd you find? - Well, they didn't know names, but thanks to Thane and Liz, we now have a map of the distribution chain.
and then a courier transports the drug supply to 5 drop-off points, where the dealers pick up the product and then sell it to their clients.
and the clients include local clubs and underground party venues.
how many of those clubs were connected to Peters?
two. But only the Edinburgh received the tainted X.
all right, let's find out everything we can about the other club.
how do you expect to stay in business if you open 20 minutes late every day?
I got a hangover. What is it to you?
we'd like to talk to you about your inventory.
we pulled your shipping orders, Mr. Beaird.
it appears you're selling more product than you're taking in.
don't you guys have anything better to do than to harass an old shopkeeper?
Yes, actually we do, so can we not waste any time?
where do you get your extra goods?
private donations.
do those donors include employees of local establishments?
look, sometimes a guy nicks a bottle or the supplies from his place of employment and brings it to me.
if I can sell it, I take it off his hands at a bargain price.
does that include cases of wine?
Yeah. I bought one a couple of weeks ago.
funny thing. The guy came back yesterday and paid the full price for what was left.
strange fellow.
guys, I found something stranger than a time-traveling police box.
what's that?
I ran financial records for all the people who work at the Franklin airport.
there is a baggage handler named Mike Spires who's been making ridiculously large cash deposits to his checking account on a weekly basis.
here's what's weird-- he's been dead for the last 4 weeks.
so how's he still making deposits?
right?
Hotchner. - Aaron.
Sean, you need to come in.
we think you may be in danger from the unsub.
he's targeting Edinburgh employees.
Yeah, I heard about Jim Peters. Look, I didn't kill him.
I know that. I also know why you ran.
of course you do.
just come in so that we can protect you.
it's time to stop running.
solve the case and I'll stop.
if Spires has been dead for a month, he can't be our guy.
why would the dealers keep paying him?
they don't know that their courier died. Someone must have taken his place.
the unsub. He killed Spires so he could get his hands on the drug supply.
who else knew he was a courier? Another package handler?
sure. They must be on the take, too, paid to look the other way.
Garcia, do any of the baggage handlers show a history of drug abuse?
a few minor infractions, but nothing that sticks out.
all right, widen the search.
have any airport employees had a drug death in the family recently?
Yeah. The daughter of Larry Feretich, Megan, she died two months ago of a suspected Ecstasy overdose.
there's your trigger. - Where did she die?
uh... The Obsidian. It's the other club owned by Jim Peters.
he's smart. He avoided dosing the Obsidian supply so we couldn't connect the murders to him.
Garcia, where's Feretich now?
at the airport. - All right, notify Morgan and Reid.
Yeah.
fran
Larry Feretich? FBI.
Larry Feretich, you're under arrest for the murder of
he killed my daughter! He killed Megan!
no, he didn't. A drug killed your daughter.
no, it was Jim Peters. I said so, but no one would listen.
thank you.
that was the Canadian drug agency.
they closed down operations at their airport.
that's a relief. Now Sean can come out of hiding.
he's exonerated. That's something.
well, I don't know about you all, but I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna head back to the hotel and take a bath.
I could drive you. I'm heading that way.
thank you, Alex. So I'll see everyone on the jet tomorrow.
could you be any more obvious?
I think I preferred you before you were a profiler.
Really?
here, buddy.
give me that.
come on in.
Jack, do you remember Uncle Sean?
Hey, Jack. It's been a long time.
and this is Beth.
it's great to finally meet you.
Yeah, well, it's not like we live in the same city or anything.
Jack, how about we go look at all that cool stuff you got at the museum today, huh?
OK.
say goodbye to Uncle Sean, Jack.
Bye. - Bye. I'll see you soon, huh?
so how did you know I took the wine?
I know what you sound like when you tell a lie.
you said something to Thane about the wine, and I could hear you calming yourself down.
my brother the profiler.
it has more to do with being your brother than being a profiler.
what did you get for the wine?
100 bucks. I needed it for rent.
Sean, you and I need to do better.
Yeah, I want to, Aaron.
look, I know what I have to do. Know any good lawyers?
I've made a couple calls.
there are two officers waiting downstairs.
Yeah, I know. I saw them on my way up.
I'll walk you down.
"cruel is the strife of brothers. " Aristotle.
that's not right. Why is that happening?
what...
what-- what
wait -- that's what the...
that's what the Replicator-- that's what the Replicator said.
where is he?
zug
how did he get in my-- how did he do it?
how did he get in? how did he get in? Hey!
wait!
kids! Wait for me!
do you really think your team is going to save you?
I know they will.
did you get everything you wanted? - What?
in life. Did you?
does anyone? - We should. Heh.
that's the point.
drinking got in your way. Your husband couldn't help.
though God knows he tried.
you know my husband?
and your poor children always played second fiddle to your ambition.
I can't see.
Oh, thank God.
David. He was here. You have to find him.
I will. I promise.
thank you.
all the love in the world won't save you.
what?
we're not finished yet.
incoming David Rossy
the Replicator's here in New York.
he took pictures of us and he hacked into Garcia's system.
I know. I will.
I love you, too. Bye.
Hey, Garcia. - Are you guys ok?
Yeah, yeah. I got Derek with me. We're meeting everyone at the hotel.
I don't know how he got in.
I'm gonna shut down the system before the Replicator can.
I am so sorry. I check everything.
I upgrade constantly.
it's not your fault, Penelope. He's just that good.
and he wanted us to know that he's here hunting us.
hold on. You got an external override.
and if the only way to get in is with the pre-authorized hard line and he didn't get in via Quantico...
Oh, my God. - What?
he was in my house.
Strauss isn't answering.
keep trying. Reid, any luck with Blake? - Not yet.
the pictures of you were taken outside of Beth's apartment.
I get it if you want to stay with them until we find him.
I've got agents surrounding Beth's building.
she and Jack are safer without me, since we're the targets.
Blake, we'll pick you up in a few minutes. The Replicator's back.
you've reached Erin Strauss. Please leave me a detailed message.
Hey, it's me again. I got your text, but I guess you fell asleep.
Hotch. Something's wrong.
the window's open. She'd never sleep like that.
did something happen to make her drink again?
No! She was working real hard at
this represents a year sober. She hasn't let to of it since she got it.
she's even a sponsor now.
the Replicator has her. I'll check the roof.
I'll have Morgan meet you up there.
Strauss is missing.
Blake, you and Reid talk to hotel security.
we need access points and footage from every camera.
Morgan, back up Dave on the roof.
JJ, take the west staircase, I'll take the east.
Erin. - Not quite.
does it ever get confusing, that whole Erin/Aaron thing?
where is she? - Closer than you think.
but she's not doing well. She looks a bit pale.
remember the last time you got a call like this?
remember?
george Foyet, right?
you were too late.
Rossi. What the hell happened?
her room was a wreck.
she been drinking?
no.
Rossi, you sure?
look, if the Replicator took her, he's probably long gone.
but he left the window open so we would come up here.
well, then this is some kind of trap or he wants us to see something.
there she is!
Dave! Dave, I've got her!
she's on a bench, she's a block east of the hotel.
call EMTs.
is he armed?
is he armed?
Erin. - I tried to find you.
it's ok. Help is on the way.
Erin, you've been drugged. We need to get you to a hospital.
no, I can't.
it's happening so fast. - Dave's called the paramedics.
he said he's gonna race you home. Does that mean anything to you?
you have to find him.
it's so quiet. Why is it so quiet?
Erin, did you recognize him?
he put a gun to my head.
he made me drink. - I'm sorry.
I wish I'd let him kill me.
did you know him?
no. He knows my family.
he knows my children! You have to protect my kids!
it's OK now, Erin. - You have to find him!
we will. We will. Just take a breath.
I love my children. Please tell them.
they know. They know.
once you said I loved my son the most.
that's not true.
I'm sorry. I was wrong.
aaron, I can't see you.
I'm right here.
I don't want to die alone.
I'm right here. It's ok.
it's ok.
affliction comes to us "not to make us sad, but sober;
not to make us sorry, but wise. " H. G. Wells.
we've got an APB, but the description of the Replicator is too general.
he wiped out all of the hotel security cameras.
ATM and traffic cameras were compromised also.
which means he hacked into at least two dozen systems.
well, he got into Garcia's place, which mean he can get in anywhere.
this guy's bragging.
he also wants us to know he can take massive risks and still get away with it.
it's probably why he took Strauss into a crowd of people.
that and to humiliate her publicly.
but he called Hotch from her phone.
it was important to him that we find her alive.
the Director wants this contained and solved.
well, at least he's not taking us off the case.
he's given us 24 hours and then he will.
I'm taking her back to Bethesda. She never liked this city, Aaron.
I'm not about to leave her.
could you give us a minute, please.
is Jack staying here? - I think it's a good idea.
you're lucky to have Beth. - I know.
her children want to meet me at Bethesda.
how old are they now?
too young for this.
you all right?
she smells of booze, Aaron.
you and I know it's because that bastard took away her dignity.
but her children might not believe that.
it's hard for them to trust anything to do with her drinking.
she struggled with it all her life.
and she was finally beating it.
he knew about Foyet? - Who's that?
he's the man who killed my wife.
that's a classified case that's not in any database.
then how would he know about it?
if he had access to the file, we're talking about someone on the inside.
conference room in 5.
Garcia, is this everything? - Yeah. The Replicator stuff is here, and the team stuff is there and there.
how's Rossi? - Not good.
is he with Strauss? - Yeah.
OK. Uh-- uh, I started with the question you asked
why attack Strauss, and on this day?
the most obvious answer is that it's an anniversary of some sort.
but there's nothing historically relevant.
it could be the smallest thing. Concentrate on New York.
if the date's that important, the setting could be, too.
it would be easier to attack Strauss at home.
is there a reason why he waited for her to be out?
well, considering she's hardly ever in the field, he sure got a lot of photos of Strauss.
it's like he's obsessed with her.
maybe Strauss was always his first target.
he attacked the top of the BAU chain first.
all right, Reid, you've matched up all the murder locations with the dates.
now we need to know how long it would take to drive to each of these locations, assuming a home base in the district.
he brought the fight here for a reason.
I'll collect all the public and private transport stuff.
Garcia, I need Kevin to go through every single pixel of these photographs.
this unsub gets off on taunting us.
he's given us answers here. We just haven't found them yet.
are you all right?
Yeah. She was a good woman.
I know. I'm sorry.
are those her children out there?
her ex is on the way.
you know the family well.
it feels like I do. Through her.
so, uh, when will we get the tox results?
we have them. It's what you expected. Meth and Ecstasy combo.
though it didn't cause the internal boiling like with the New York victims.
a lower dose, or did he alter it?
we won't know until we get the exact breakdown.
I'll let you know the second I hear.
so what do you make of the markings on her wrist?
torture, right? It was done antemortem.
what? - The carving I showed you.
right. Sorry. Can you show me that again?
Dave, a figure 8?
that's what it looks like. I just sent you all a picture.
maybe it's an infinity symbol.
well, if it's infinity, he could be boasting "I'll go on forever"?
or if it's an 8, Strauss was his eighth victim.
and the unofficial eighth member of our team.
if this is a taunt from him, it's too random.
well, he's only sent one message and he seems to be real proud of it.
Zugzwang. - Then what does this mean?
Rossi, the cut looks jagged. Any idea what caused the serration?
best guess is a piece of glass.
maybe he used empty bottles from the mini bar?
those were all plastic. The M. E. is checking for splinters now.
all right, let us know what you find out.
anything from the photographs yet?
we blew up a few more and this one seems to stand out.
when were you in a tuxedo? - It was a British embassy event.
security clearance is high. - Security was insane there.
that kind of accessibility, plus knowing about Foyet, the fact that he was able to get through all of my security clearances alone, you guys are right. You have to trust your gut.
the Replicator has gotta be on the inside.
the Director needs to know the status of the system failure.
give me another few hours.
he's not happy about it. - Yeah, well, who is?
confidentiality
if the Replicator's an insider, is there any way Strauss knew him?
she said she didn't recognize him.
to her defense, she was disoriented by the drug overdose.
she was adamant about it.
well, even if Strauss didn't know him, it doesn't mean he didn't know her.
within the Bureau, she is the face of the BAU.
and clearly a target from the beginning. But why?
more importantly, what was he replicating? - The drug overdose.
I mean with the 8. It hasn't been part of any other case, and he's not one to make mistakes. He thought he was replicating a crime.
the Director made us walk away from the case a few months ago.
Strauss said that she wouldn't let it go. What if she hadn't?
you think she started her own investigation?
well, if she thought he was an insider, she might have done something to trap him.
why wouldn't she have told you about that back in New York?
maybe she didn't have proof.
but her determination, plus the fact that he doesn't make mistakes makes me think that the 8 was part of her plan to catch him.
do we have her laptop?
all the hacking in the world isn't gonna help if they shut us down.
he can't win, not like this.
this is Strauss' laptop.
I need to access who was on the distribution list for my case reports.
you don't know who reads your reports?
I know she sent them to the head of the criminal division and the Director, but I don't know who else is on the list.
the last case she sent in was the case in Detroit.
the Cutter.
she amended the report and said that the unsub cut a figure 8 into his victims' wrists.
but he didn't do that. - No, he didn't.
so she duped him.
which means that one of the people reading these reports has gotta be the Replicator.
it doesn't show who else saw this.
two other people read the report. - Who?
you're gonna need a tie.
agent Hotchner, I have a very full day.
Yes, sir, we all do.
senator, can I suggest that we move this into your office.
there's nothing you can tell me that these walls have not heard before.
how long has the Department of Justice been watching the BAU?
that's no secret.
we made it clear to your Director and your section chief that we were watching your team closely ever since that ordeal with agent...
Prentiss. - Yes.
she's running an office in London and that's a good place for her.
you receive my case files from the Director.
well, agent, that's classified.
sir, it's not a question. I know you're on the list.
I need to know who else has access to them.
I'm not answering that until I get some insight as to what this is all about.
Erin Strauss told us all about it.
he killed last night, sir, in New York. She was murdered.
wh? Why haven't I been told about this?
the Director's keeping this contained.
we believe that this unsub is targeting the rest of us, and we've determined that he's someone within the highest levels of the justice system and he's been reading the details of my reports.
I need the names, sir.
at least this narrows it down.
finding someone on the inside should be easier.
not necessarily. If our unsub was trained by law enforcement, he'd know how to fit in perfectly.
there's meaning and purpose to everything he does.
why did he choose to replicate the Silencer case?
well, that unsub went dormant for years 'cause he was locked up.
well, it speaks to his patience.
what about his M. O? He sewed mouths shut.
it symbolizes keeping secrets. There could be something in that.
he's targeting everyone.
so how does that particular case factor into all of us?
it's the first one Garcia and I worked on with Blake.
Yeah, but the rest of us worked on the Seattle case before that.
right. The unsub who used his kid to bait the victims.
we need to see if he replicated that one.
the system is still down, thanks to yours truly, which I'm horrified about.
I'm trying to get the deets on the Seattle case this way now, literally.
you and I were in London when the other guys spent time in Seattle.
I'm on the phone right now with Jennie from ViCAP to see if that particular M. O. has ever been duplicated.
Yeah, I'm still here.
uh, it would be Seattle, early September.
right.
no, not email. Can you fax it? Fax, yeah.
thank you. Thank you. - I take that as a yes.
before he copied the Silencer case, he was in Seattle weeks after they solved the sadist.
go check the fax machine. She just sent you that replicated case.
Thanks, baby girl. - Yeah. Yeah.
OK. I did something right. I did something right.
I need everybody in the conference room.
a dozen federal employees have read our case files over the last two years.
they all went through the highest levels of security.
each of those names needs to be checked against Reid's list.
we should get them all in here and start the interrogations.
if he knows we're looking his way, he might retreat.
we should also check the support staffs of all those employees.
each one has two assistants, so we're already up to 36 people.
we should start with agents who work a 4-day, 40-hour week, given the fact that most of the murders happened over a long weekend, which means if the unsub traveled by car, no one at work would've missed them.
well, he probably wouldn't fly. It would leave a paper trail.
what's this?
the Replicator's first case was the same as mine.
remember the sadist who made Ridgeway look tame?
in Seattle, so it wasn't the Silencer.
do you think it's a coincidence he started all of this when I joined the team?
I don't know.
Dave's back? Excuse me.
he's only been back a few minute it looks like it's hitting him pretty hard.
well, they were together for the last year.
that's the Director. I'll be right back.
Yes, sir. This is Agent Hotchner.
Hey, Rossi.
you all right? You don't look so good.
get out.
look, I know this has gotta be tough on you
Rossi, what the hell are you doing?
Rossi, put the gun down. Rossi.
what's going on?
Morgan's DNA was on the glass that cut her wrist.
Strauss? - You did that.
no, I didn't.
Dave, someone on the inside is doing this.
you're looking at him.
Derek did not hurt her, and you have to trust me on this.
trust you? I bet you told Erin the same thing.
look what that got her.
Dave, you've been drugged.
I was too late, Erin.
I'm so sorry.
he wants us against each other. If you pull that trigger, he wins.
she's not there.
give me the gun.
I'm gonna call the paramedics.
sit down. It's all right.
they've given him a sedative and they're going to take him to the infirmary.
he's gonna be ok.
how did it get into his system?
the report must have been dusted with whatever he used on Strauss.
luckily the transdermal absorption rate was lower than her ingestion of it, so it wasn't fatal for Rossi.
then this was a warning.
if he wanted to kill Rossi, he had every chance to do it.
if this is his endgame, why is he wasting time with warnings?
he's toying with us and we're playing into him.
he's turned Rossi against Morgan.
even if it was temporary, he wanted to show it could be done.
but why?
Strauss was dosed with a chemical cousin of Doctor Death.
he altered it so her torture would be longer.
a biochemist, computer hacker, and federal agent?
who the hell is this guy?
only half the cameras are working because the system is still rebooting itself, so the security guards have to go old school.
that means everyone has to sign in.
you can't take your I. D. And run it through
well, you know what old school means.
so, if you have a badge, you don't get harassed.
the man who signed in to see Rossi went up to the sixth floor, held the door open for Kevin and Anderson...
I can't believe he was right there.
walked through our BAU into Rossi's office, signed in as Adam Worth.
isn't that the same alias he used when Maeve went missing?
Yeah, which means it's not just a taunt. It speaks directly to his psychology.
Adam Worth was a famous criminal from the late 1800s, commonly referred to as the Napoleon of Crime.
this unsub obviously sees himself in the same light.
so this guy is a malignant narcissist who wants to be known as the worst enemy we've ever had.
and look, he's careful to hide his face from the cameras.
because he knows exactly where they are.
the Replicator has directly taunted everyone on this team except for me.
you may be part of his endgame. - Then so was Strauss.
he chose to use drugs as his final replication.
that's no accident.
is that a connection to you?
Strauss and I had issues during the Amerithrax case.
it started in New York with poison.
and it was delivered by envelopes.
why would anyone on the inside hold resentment over that case?
because that person suffered a professional setback just like Blake, but was patient and psychotic enough to get revenge.
I am all over the DOJ names including support staff.
I have Kevin pulling files and photos.
system is down, so it's hard to check entire career paths, but there were two agents in New York in 2001.
scratch that-- Lehman died in October-- that leaves Curtis.
wait a second? John Curtis?
you know him?
I haven't seen him in a long time. He was a nice guy.
we were first office agents together, but I thought he left the Bureau after the Amerithrax case.
could it be him? Does he fit the profile?
he was quiet and a loner, but brilliant.
he specialized in a lot of fields, but his passion was biochemistry.
he inherited a family compound in rural Virginia.
coordinates on on your phone.
what else do you have on Curtis? - Just like you thought.
John Curtis was demoted in the FBI after the Amerithrax case.
he was slated to take over the coveted New York field office, but then was shipped to the not coveted Kansas City one.
he worked there for many years quietly before he was able to weasel his way back into the nation's capital.
on paper he is a rock star.
he immediately transferred to the Department of Justice, the intelligence oversight section.
he's a genius on multiple levels.
what's his background?
only child, parents died when he was 18. Never married.
total loner, just like Blake said.
then all he's ever had to care about is his work.
and when he lost that, he snapped.
hrt will divide us up when we land.
as you can see from the geo ref'd he's got plenty of privacy.
5 1/2 acres, 3 structures, house included.
I see it, too, sir. It must be some sort of system override.
what's happening? - Autopilot's seized.
Oh, God. - Mayday.
I got it back.
are you ok? - We're stabilizing.
brace for impact.
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
I can't get through to any of them.
we have agents in those choppers.
it was only one. The first is circling back now.
are they ok?
copy.
OK, as a precaution, they separated to land on opposite sides of the property, and the controls were taken over by a remote override.
which can only happen within a 5-mile radius.
he knew they were coming. - And how they were getting there.
are you guys all right? - Yeah.
Where's Blake?
what the hell is this? What is this?
we're back in business.
thank you.
sir. - Where is everybody?
right this second, in a field.
if he'd wanted to kill all of us, he could have.
he's playing God, just like he's done all year.
he hard-landed us, knocked us out with whatever was in those canister he could take Blake.
he had plenty of chances to take her before tonight.
he wants it to be a spectacle.
what do you want?
you're the profiler. You tell me.
you don't want to know. - Reverse psychology.
I'm not going to beg for your analysis.
you don't have to beg.
I already know how desperate you are for it.
I didn't remember you being so skittish.
you've never seen me in chains before?
I've seen you with your hands tied, so to speak.
Erin Strauss and the Bureau discarded us.
we were the forgotten ones.
they forgot you. I did all right.
but they'll remember me now.
you know, I admired you back then, leading the charge on the day it all changed, the day Erin Strauss ruined us.
I sat next to you.
borrowed your pen to sign my transfer.
they put me in Kansas. Me.
you know what I've been wondering?
why did Strauss change her mind about you?
I kept my head down and I worked hard.
we all did.
but you got my chance.
we're ready to breach the house.
which way did he go? - I don't know.
Morgan, you and JJ find him. We've got this.
he said he used 8 locks because there used to be 8 of us.
that's all he said? - About that, yes.
there's only 6 keys. That mean two keys will be used twice.
each key is a letter, likely corresponds to a number on the locks.
7-- seventh letter of the alphabet's "G."
what are the other letters?
um, Z,U, W-- Zugzwang.
it's too easy.
solvant
he's got the placed lined with C-4. We've only got 3 minutes.
this seems too easy.
zugzwang almost means a dilemma in chess where the best move is not to move at all.
wait, don't get up!
it's a pressure sensor.
signal - They've gotta hurry. - Sir, I can't block this thing off for long.
drop the gun.
you'd really die for them?
that's the oath we all took.
to protect our country from people like you, no matter what.
you never appreciated me, none of you.
I gave you my life, and you rejected me.
you can tell me your sob story while walking.
everybody get back! There's C-4 in the basement.
everybody back!
wait, where's Rossi?
he was right behind me. - Dave!
he just let us out. Why would he go back in?
we'll go out as heroes.
I'm not so sure about that.
Zugzwang.
it had to be a perfect round.
and sure enough, coming right back at me was the target.
and it was blasted right through the chest.
the goggles come off... and it's Strauss.
I mean, I was like, what?
I would have never believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.
that woman...
she was one hell of a shot.
do you guys remember that one time that she called me, but I thought that it was somebody else?
Oh, no. - That was funny.
Oh, maybe to you. I was mortified.
what did you say? - I said,"Talk dirty to me."
Yes, she did. That's my girl.
are you kidding?
Hey, that was my line.
whatever are you doing here?
last year, right here, we had a...
very different celebration.
of life, of love, and good people.
this year it's the, uh, other side of that.
because, well... that's what families do.
it's been a hard year.
but tonight...
we celebrate a life well lived...
well loved...
to a good woman...
an even better mother...
to our friend...
who I will miss very much.

that's it. That's him.

hold on.
is he serious?
he moved in two months ago.
he's still putting together furniture?
it's only 8: 00 at night.
you've got to get him to stop.
after this page, I'll go talk to him.
talk to him? Or bludgeon him?
what, are they doing it on the floor?
I need to study now.
put your headphones on.
you know what? If you won't do it, I will.
I said I would do it after this page.
open the door!
I know you're in there. I can hear you!
the whole building can!
Really?
open the door! Hello?
look, I hate to be a buzz-kill, but I have a huge test tomorrow.
my roommate's at it again, huh?
we're right below you.
I'll tell him you showed up.
ever since he met this chick, they've been going at it like rabbits.
maybe they should go to her place.
I'll suggest that.
sorry.
we were this close to going to Ocean City, and I get the text.
you don't have a hybrid, Spence.
I know, but if I did, I'd want to know.
weren't we just here?
did your date understand?
Ah, luckily we're neighbors.
you must be peeved.
I get to Dulles, make it through security, about to board the plane to Boston, and bam, I get the call.
I say we all demand a vacation.
from who, the guy that works 3 jobs? Good luck with that.
whoa, you never went home.
no, I had these unit chief performance appraisals to do when we got back.
so how many all-nighters have you pulled this month?
I don't know. Between the file reviews and the appraisals, there isn't enough time.
Erin would, uh, always bring her work home with her.
Yeah, I know. She definitely underplayed the amount of paperwork.
so, how long do you think they're gonna ask you to do this double duty?
well, they asked me if I'd be interested in the job full-time.
that would mean leaving the BAU.
I bought myself some time by asking them to at least post the position.
well, we both know the pros and cons.
there are lots of them.
we'll talk about it later.
sorry you guys had to come in again. Garcia?
Yeah. Two women, Sarah Beck and Jill Elks, were found in a park in Glendale, Arizona, within the last 3 days.
both of them were single, in their late 20s, and following their normal, low-risk routines when they were abducted.
where were they taken from?
Sarah was on her way to a theater group rehearsal, and Jill was abducted from her apartment.
the unsub broke in through a window.
well, clearly, he's hunting a specific type.
he left the jewelry untouched.
Yeah, it's not about robbery.
both women were sexually assaulted, and then they were shot in the heart and left in that prayer position.
that's odd.
maybe it's religious. It looks like they're leaning on a cross.
their hands are tilted forward.
he could have made them supplicate and their hands clenched in rigor mortis.
so they're possibly praying to atone for their sins.
I doubt that. Both women have pretty clean backgrounds.
since the posing was done postmortem, maybe it's a representation of the way in which he made them beg for their lives.
we've definitely seen that before.
he's getting off on the power.
let's head to Arizona. Wheels up in 30.
please, please, not so fast.
go.
I can't.
it hurts.
you're not gonna get away with this.
they're gonna find you!
who knows where inspiration comes from?
perhaps it arises from desperation."Perhaps it comes from the flukes of the universe, the kindness of the muses."Amy Tan.
all right, let's go over victimology.
both of these women were professionals, young, single, blond, both in their late 20s, and petite.
and besides appearance, there's no apparent connection.
the prayer position is unique.
both these women were left in parks.
the dumpsites could be symbolic. I mean, a lot of religions are based in nature, celebrating the outdoors.
pilgrimages are often made to parks.
believers say they're closer to God in places like that.
maybe he believes they're surrogates for a woman who cheated on him or rejected him.
either way, the unsub participates in high-risk behavior.
he abducts and controls the victims, takes them to secluded locations, rapes them and kills them, all within 12 hours.
his yet to be determined ritual leaves no outward indicators.
well, we know he has a gun, the ability to abduct his victims, take them to a lair, and discard them in a park.
so he probably has a van or SUV.
and he's planned things out.
he abducted one victim on her way to a theater, another one from her apartment.
so he stalks them.
the consistency of the disposal sites and methodologies tells us that he has no known or identifiable connection between any of the victims and in fact wants them to be found in order to convey his posed prayer message.
well, the parks will give us behavioral clues to help us fill out our profile.
all right, we should split up when we hit the ground.
he's probably already chosen his next victim.
you want a double shot or a regular?
regular.
you sure, Wallace?
it's free since you work in the mall.
I'm fine.
Hey, what time do you get off?
why, you got something planned?
you want to go sit by the fountain?
I would, but I got a date.
I gotta go.
see you tomorrow, Wallace.
OK. Thanks.
thank you.
Yeah.
I'll see you tomorrow.
woman: You want her, too, Wallace?
leave me alone.
leave me the hell alone.
this type of detailed ritualistic behavior typically manifests itself in multiple kills over a short period of time.
I've increased the manpower on the street.
I was even thinking about doing a press conference.
at this point, it would be better if we could conduct our analysis without media interference.
we'll need a separate room to do interviews.
there's one over there.
sergeant? Yeah?
another vic, Emma Coleman, was found in Bonsall Park.
that's a mile from here.
and two miles from the other dumpsite, which tells us the unsub's zone of comfort is within a 3-mile radius.
I'll reroute Morgan and Rossi to the scene.
and we'll see if we can locate her next of kin.
good. We'll need to talk to them.
OK.
all right, Rossi, talk to me.
what's up?
only the sun. I like the sun.
cute. That's real cute.
look, when I was the gym, conversation around the free weights is Hotch is interviewing to be Strauss's permanent replacement.
I know nothing.
come on, man, you sure about that?
why do I get the feeling you're being a profiler?
if you have any questions about Hotch, maybe you should ask Hotch.
OK, look, I get it. Doing double duty after the sequester, fine, but taking on a desk job full-time?
you know what they say about desk jobs.
that's how you get the ladies?
no. Sitting is the new smoking.
that'll kill Hotch, and you know that.
well, it's the same as last time, except this woman has light-brown hair.
looks like she threw up.
maybe it was nerves.
she knew she was going to die.
she had on a wedding ring.
it's right over there. He must have tossed it.
strange.
Yeah, all of the other victims were single females.
jewelry was left untouched.
so either this guy has a disdain for marriage or his fantasy is single women.
so maybe he got rid of the ring 'cause it didn't fit his parameters.
if that's the case, why not go after a single woman in the first place?
and why not take off the ring during the rape?
that is the question.
this is a dream, right?
you're going to tell me this is a nightmare?
we know this is difficult, Mr. Coleman.
I don't know what to say. I need to call her parents.
can we--can we ask you a few questions first?
when was the last time you saw your wife?
two days ago.
two days ago?
that's-- that's a long time.
why didn't you call the police?
we've been separated.
yesterday Emma was supposed to meet me at counseling, but she never showed up.
we were doing better.
we were talking, not yelling.
in fact, she was planning on moving back in.
you didn't think it was odd that she missed your session?
I just thought she was getting cold feet.
and that maybe she still wanted to...
wanted to be with him.
your wife was having an affair?
do you know who he was?
I asked her, but she wouldn't tell me.
maybe our unsub is killing cheaters.
that would explain why he poses them in the prayer position.
or he's just gaining confidence.
the first two women were single, blond.
now he's moved on to married ones with varying looks.
he's either changing his victimology or he knew that the first two were unfaithful.
Hey, Garcia.
I was starting to feel like the hottest people I know had left me at the altar, but now you're here to kiss me with crime. What's up?
we need to get the 411 on our last victim, Emma Coleman.
she was supposedly having an affair.
any frequently called men?
uh, Uncle Sam. She was behind on her taxes.
how about credit cards used at a hotel?
no. Mm. She looks like me.
a lot of online shopping and Indian takeout.
reid: Any suspicious texts?
to her mother. That's about it.
all right, well, send us a list of the 3 women she called the most this month.
those are her BFFs.
they'll know who she's fooling around with.
got it.
Hello?
stop!
Aah! Stop!
please, Wallace, don't!
why are you doing this?!
Wallace, stop!
was she raped as well?
repeatedly. Multiple lacerations to the genitalia.
and one shot through the heart.
the perfect shot, too.
what about the vomit found at the crime scene?
are the results back yet?
it was tinged with blood.
I'm still working on the stomach.
is that from repeated vomiting?
possibly.
she swallowed her own?
she's not missing one. This belongs to someone else.
woman: You think this is gonna help, Wallace?
shut up!
you can't hurt me.
too late.
just let me go. I won't tell anyone.
shut up, Heather.
no. No.
dinnertime.
the M. E.'s report came back from the first two vics.
they also had skull fragments and human remains in their systems.
this woman looks nothing like the last 3.
the victim pool's expanding.
so I talked to Emma's best friend and she knew the lover's name.
turns out he was out of town for all of the kills and his alibi checks out.
so he's not our killer.
guys, look.
she choked on something.
Oh, jeez, tell me that's hers.
it's not.
well, the tongue's still from the head region.
but who's the source?
he either has a job working with dead bodies, or that's from his first victim who we haven't found yet.
if we stick with the religious theory, it could be some sort of communion.
body of Christ.
if we can identify this victim, it'll help lead us to our unsub.
let's bag it and run the DNA.
we're ready to give the profile.
we believe that this unknown subject is a white male in his early 30s.
initially he targeted white, blond women in their 20s but is expanding his victim pool.
his M. O. is to rape his victims and then shoot them in the heart.
at the disposal site, he poses them as if they're praying.
he's trying to convey a message that only he understands.
before he kills his victims, he forces the women to consume human flesh.
it's called projected cannibalism.
typically cannibalism is a willing choice, but the act of forcing someone to engage in it is a form of torture.
it tells us that the unsub is sadistic and most likely delusional.
the emergence of those delusions would have caused difficulties in his relationships and jobs in the past.
he may have been institutionalized or locked up as a result.
BLAKE: He sees himself as an enforcer and is punishing these women for their sins.
he may have an overly developed sense of morality and feels the need to superimpose this on others.
this is the comfort zone our unsub is operating in.
we should increase police presence within this area.
are you gonna tempt her?
are you?
you know what's odd?
usually in cannibalism, it's the visceral organs and the fleshy parts being eaten.
but this unsub is making the victims eat exclusively from the head.
Why?
that may be symbolic.
it's the one body part a person cannot survive losing.
all right, so why don't you two keep looking into that, and then we can devise a neighborhood canvass questionnaire, check for any attempted break-ins in the area.
someone's practicing for his new role.
look, rumor has it Hotch is putting in for Strauss' job.
see no evil, hear no gossip.
Oh, come on, we see evil all day long.
Rossi says if we want to know, we gotta ask the big man himself.
I've asked Garcia to compile a list of break-ins in the area and also a missing persons report.
and yes, they did talk to me about the section chief job.
do you want it?
I know what I don't want is an outsider coming in and questioning every move that this team makes.
I told them that I'd think about it.
so what happens if you accept?
it means this would be my last ca in the field, but nothing's been decided.
and as soon as I figure out what to do, you'll be the first to know.
we just got a lead on a parolee who fits the profile.
we're going to pick him up.
all right, Rossi, you and Morgan go check it out.
the rest of us will go over the victimology statements.
you should have told me, Heather.
but, no, I had to find out in the paper.
mom?
what's wrong?
I've left you a bunch of messages and you never call me back.
every time I don't call back, it doesn't mean that there's something wrong.
well, the ladies at the hairdresser told me that Heather's missing.
what?
what are you talking about?
she went away on business and she hasn't come back.
I'm sure it's a misunderstanding.
Wallace, please tell me...
you haven't talked to her.
of course not, mom.
Oh, God! What is that?!
what? What?
Wallace, what's wrong with you, honey?
I got to go, Ma.
I don't feel well.
liar! Shut up!
Wallace, are you ok?
no, he's sick.
let me in. Let me make you something to eat.
it's ok. I got to go, ma.
I got to go. I got a shift in an hour.
Wallace, please! No, please!
all right. Thanks, Morgan.
so, that parolee the sergeant had a lead on turned out to be a bust.
what do you think about Hotch?
I think it sucks.
what do we do?
uh, nothing.
what do you mean, nothing? I don't want him to leave.
at least he'll still be around.
Yeah, with his name on our reports.
look, I'm sure it's been hard for him on the road.
he's not going to admit it, but a desk job would be easier on Jack.
he'll suffocate.
you don't get it.
Why? Because I don't have kids?
I would have.
Spence... You still will.
Dr. Reid, the M. E. just emailed this over.
see?
I'm sure he just misses that.
I'm gonna eat you up!
eat you up!
Yes. Yes, I am.
that's it.
that's it.
what?
guys, I think I figured out why our unsub's obsessed with the human head.
the DNA reports are back in.
all of the human remains found in the victims' stomachs are from the same person.
so what does that mean?
it's a long explanation, so bear with me.
when Pheidippides ran a marathon, he had faith.
he also died. Go on.
true. If you take the fact that our unsub performs forced sexual acts with his victims, then add to that the force-feeding of a human head and the posed prayer position,
I know this sounds crazy, but I think our unsub is obsessed with the praying mantis.
that also explains why he poses the victims' hands like this instead of like this.
the praying mantis can kill any of a multitude of creatures, but the most interesting fact is that oftentimes the female mantis engages in sexual cannibalism, meaning she'll bite off the head of her mate once copulation is complete, sometimes even during intercourse, actually.
so that's what someone did to our unsub.
it also explains why he shoots his victims through the heart.
but the center of our unsub's anger didn't bite off his head.
no, but she hurt him so badly that she got into his brain.
so he's flipping the script.
he's completely taking it over.
he basically sees the victims as the praying mantis out to destroy him, so before they can get to him, he rapes them, forces them to engage in cannibalism, thereby taking away their control of the situation.
he's essentially walking them through the mating behavior of a captive praying mantis, only entirely on his terms.
he even mirrors the decapitation of the insect by forcing them to eat pieces of a human head, only it's not a male human head, it's a female human head.
the woman that's the core of his rage.
exactly. Now all women are his enemy.
they're his predators, and he believes they're out to get him.
get away from me.
get away from me!
get away from me!
Garcia, how are we doing on the missing persons reports?
there are 6 women that have gone missing in the Glendale area in the last month.
any of them from within the comfort zone?
one, but she's a kid in the middle of a custody battle.
what about surrounding areas?
that adds 8 women.
see if any of them have any connections to the area.
there's one lady, Heather Clarke, from Phoenix, Arizona.
she went to school in the area 15 years ago.
she fits the age.
and here's a thing
uh, she went missing two weeks ago, and 6 days prior to her missingness-ness-ness, it was announced in the paper she was to be married.
unsub must have seen that and it triggered his anger.
that would explain why he threw away the third victim's wedding ring.
guys, Heather has a DNA sample on file.
all right, pull that and let's compare it to the tooth we found in the latest victim's body.
what are you doing?
I'm not leaving, Wallace.
shut up.
shut up!
I'm not going to tell you again-- get out!
I would have left him for you.
liar!
why don't you believe me?
because you lied to me! You never loved me!
Yes, I did, Wallace.
No!
I loved you, Wallace.
stop lying!
I loved you.
don't hurt me.
I loved you.
I loved you. I loved you.
I loved you!
what's going on?
nothing.
I heard you screaming. I can't concentrate.
then move.
what did you say?
I said move!
because the next time you knock on my door will be the last time you come up those steps.
Heather's DNA sample matches the tooth found in our victim's stomach.
Garcia, Heather Clarke is the victim that our unsub's been feeding to the others.
Yikes.
see if she has any enemies.
no. She was her company's top regional manager.
she--she looks loved.
well, the unsub's rage has probably been brewing for a long time.
and he most likely expressed his disdain for her long before he killed her.
baby girl, check middle and high school records.
no, zero, zero. There's nothing there.
there's got to be something.
see if her parents ever filed a restraining order.
Oh, creepy bingo.
when Heather was 16, she broke up with a guy named Wallace Hines.
Wallace did not take the breaking up well.
he went into an emo downward spiral.
what happened to Wallace?
he was hospitalized.
mom: It's ok. Everything is gonna be ok.
in fact, he's been in and out of institutions for over a decade.
he suffers from acute delusional disorder.
where is he now?
he was living with his mom until very recently.
he moved two miles away from her, right smack in the middle of the hunting zone.
so Wallace killed Heather, and when that didn't alleviate his rage, he began killing other women.
send us both addresses.
Blake, you and Reid notify Heather's parents.
Wallace, you're late.
I forgot my bag.
we got a bridal shower and a bridge club lunch.
did you forget how to cook, too?
no.
then go get changed. We got food to make.
his old bedroom was full of pictures of Heather, but he's cut the heads off of all of them.
what the hell is going on?
I'm Agent Hotchner with the FBI. We're looking for your son.
Why? Is he in trouble?
when was the last time you spoke to him?
uh, he left me a message. He, um...
said he was sorry.
did he say where he was going?
what did he do?
Wallace, there was supposed to be bacon on this, man.
no problem.
there you go.
Hey, I got something.
he works at Wheeler's.
this doesn't taste right.
wallace: Good afternoon, ladies.
time to eat.
eat.
what are you doing?
just put the gun down.
I can't do that.
these people didn't do anything to you.
no, she hurt me...
then she ate me.
please.
Oh, here we go.
you hurt me!
what is he talking about?
you know what I'm talking about!
you hurt me and then you ate me.
is that what I did, Wallace?
shut up.
shut up!
Wallace, these people didn't do anything to you.
no, I did.
you hurt me!
damn right I did!
stop it!
stop it!
come on, Wallace.
you know I loved you.
just do it.
do it!
come on, Wallace.
Hey! Drop the gun.
drop it!
where is he?
through the kitchen.
we're at the east end of the garage. We don't have him.
our suspect is on the loose.
I want an APB put out to all our officers in neighboring jurisdictions.
anything?
all units, all units--we have an APB on a Wallace Hines wanted in a shooting at Wheeler's restaurant.
he is armed and dangerous.
5-5-David, I just saw armed suspect going south down holden.
he's in a dark Ford Taurus, turning right on Washington near Holden.
that's right near us.
we're approaching that location from the north.
that's it. That's him.
in pursuit of a black Ford Taurus going westbound on Washington, crossing State.
Arizona license plate 52B7HN.
hold on.
get out of the car!
now!
get out of the car.
slowly.
turn around.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you.
so, uh, any news on the job front?
no, but they said that they wanted to talk to me again when we got back.
I've thought a lot about it.
I don't know what to tell them.
well, I can think of a million ways to sabotage you.
just say the word.
Hey, what's wrong?
for two people who made a big arrest, you look pretty unsettled.
something was off about Wallace.
the--the restaurant shooting was so chaotic and disorganized.
Yeah, it was.
but when we arrested him...
he was controlled.
he was together.
well, Richard Farley was like that after his rampage.
Yeah, so was Edward Tallaway.
reid: Everyone has a different reaction to being caught.
you guys did good.
Hey, Sarge, look at this.
Yes.
I'm sorry?
thank you.
we got the wrong guy.
what?
the fingerprints at the restaurant don't match.
Hotch, how is that possible?
we're now going to bring you news.
let's go to our reporter on the scene.
we're here at the corner of Washington and Market, where Wallace Hines was arrested for a shooting at Wheeler's earlier today.
he's also suspected in the murders of at least 5 other women in the Glendale area, and residents are relieved he is in custody.
stay tuned for further updates.
Hey. You gonna buy that or what?
Josh Billings once wrote,"there are two things in life for which we are never truly prepared...
twins.
to BE CONTINUED.
no. No. - Come on.
no, stop, no.
relax.
please stop. Stop! I said stop!
you little bitch.
Oh, my God!
please stop! You're hurting him!
please, please stop!
dad?
no.
Hey, Jessica, it's me. I'm sorry, I dozed off.
um, is everything all right?
OK. Jack's all right?
great.
um... I should be there in about a half an hour, ok?
Yeah, sorry. Thanks.
Hey, it's me again. I'm--I'm not gonna make it.
Yeah. I'm sorry. I'll call you later.
I just put in new brakes.
she's running like a dream.
I always admired the aesthetic of the classic Torpedo C body, especially in the 1947.
they just don't make them like that anymore.
Yeah, well, I'm lucky to have found it.
uncle Sal would be proud.
thank you for coming in, everyone.
we can get started.
OK. Guys, meet Samantha Wilcox, 16-year-old junior in Wichita, Kansas.
last night she snuck out with her boyfriend, they were attacked, she hasn't been seen since.
boyfriend got a broken jaw and a concussion.
and the description of the attacker matches her father, Eddie Lee Wilcox.
ex-con.
Oh, is he ever. Still on parole.
Eddie is a car thief and wheel man extraordinaire.
string of assault charges, too.
been in and out of jail since he was a kid.
we don't usually work parental abduction cases.
we do when the abduction's violent and dad's a former convict.
he hasn't been incarcerated in over 3 years.
I mean he's had ample opportunity.
why pick yesterday to kidnap her?
well, he beat the boyfriend within an inch of his life to do it, so taking her had to be real important.
and apparently Eddie was none too pleased that Samantha's mom Melody had decided to remarry and then move from Chicago to Wichita.
he lost visitation rights the last time he got locked up.
so the anger about that is the stressor that builds up over the years.
last night he decides to do something about it.
this could be vengeance for taking his daughter away.
if it's revenge against the mother, he'll either hurt Samantha or disappear with her.
she's been missing for over 5 hours, and we know how time sensitive these cases are.
the AMBER Alert is expanding?
every hour... Excuse me.
Mr. Hotchner, can you hear me?
he's not responding.
pulse is thready.
starting lactated ringers, wide open.
systolic's dropping. BP's 90 over 60.
stay with me.
bleeding internally from what?
they think it's probably all the scar tissue.
torn adhesions from the stab wounds.
george Foyet returns from the grave.
what's the prognosis?
he's stable right now.
did an ultrasound, but can't seem to see exactly where the bleeding was coming from.
he'll need an exploratory laparotomy.
does Jack know?
not yet. I talked to Haley's sister Jessica.
we didn't want to worry the little guy.
what about Beth?
I left a message, but she's on a business trip in Milan.
look, I know you're all worried.
and that's exactly what we're gonna do.
when the plane lands, Morgan, JJ, I want you to interview Samantha Wilcox's mother.
Reid, Blake, you go check out the abduction site.
I'm catching the the next flight to Wichita and I'll meet you there.
what about Hotch?
Garcia's here. She's not going anywhere.
now, let's go find this girl.
breakfast.
come on, I know you're not sleeping.
what, are you gonna ignore me forever?
I said I was sorry.
Oh, come on, Sammy.
don't call me that.
where are we? - Texas.
granola bar? Can we stop and get a McMuffin or something?
maybe later when we stop for gas.
when's that? - I need coffee.
a couple of hours. You drink coffee now?
Yes.
and I hate granola.
you gonna talk to me?
I cannot believe you did that.
I know. I'm sorry. I lost my temper.
you just showed up.
you should have called or something.
I didn't even have time to say goodbye to my friends.
how many times you want me to apologize?
I am sorry.
no? All right, then.
we had a deal.
you wanted out of Wichita, here we are.
but you gotta lose the 'tude or we're never gonna make it.
angel, I swear, you are gonna love it down there.
ocean breezes.
sunny every day.
nowhere near Wichita.
that's my girl.
he's just one of those guys, you know?
he makes you feel special.
you think you can change him, but he never does.
were you aware of Eddie's criminal background?
he told me he was a mechanic.
I thought all those new cars were part of his job.
but after a while I noticed things.
like what?
his sketchy friends.
um, sometimes he'd be gone for days and then suddenly he'd have all this cash.
was he ever violent with you?
he's got a bad temper.
what about with Samantha?
he wasn't around enough.
he got locked up when she was 6 and didn't get out until she was 13.
after that I moved.
but I wasn't the one who told him.
Sam was.
so they were in touch.
how often were they in contact?
I don't know.
she doesn't tell me anything.
we fight all the time.
I--I thought it was because she's a teenager, but
you can't blame yourself.
you did everything you could to try to keep her safe.
I did all that because I've always been scared she's too much like him.
get him into O. R. 2 right away.
Yes, Doctor.
Hey, Morgan. How is he?
he's still out.
they're taking him to surgery now.
listen, we need those big old brains of yours if you're ready.
born ready.
all right, we need you to check out all of Samantha Wilcox's texts and email correspondence.
OK. What am I looking for?
anything in particular?
she's been in touch with her dad on the D. L. There might be something in there.
Oh, and check ViCAP for any recent armed robberies between Wichita and Eddie Lee Wilcox's last known address in Chicago.
Why?
well, according to Samantha's mom, Eddie may have been more than a car thief.
how much more? - Armed robber more.
he may be running from something work related.
got you.
they just wheeled Hotch into the surgery right now.
all right, keep us posted.
you know I will.
we should swing east and hit New Orleans.
it's supposed to be awesome.
Yeah, it's overrated.
come on, it'll be so much fun.
and I can help drive 'cause I'm in Drivers Ed.
no time.
job starts in two days with or without me.
then how about Padre Island?
it looks pretty and it's on the way.
what?
nothin'.
I just can't believe how grown up you got.
I missed you, too.
what? What's wrong?
no, no, no, no, no.
don't turn around and don't slouch.
just sit up and act normal.
I told you you shouldn't have beat him up so bad.
now you're probably wanted.
Oh, my God, Dad, what are you doing?
relax. Everything's gonna be ok.
what? You were gonna shoot a cop?
no. Of course not.
glove box is the first place they check.
can I see it?
you ever handle a gun? - No.
then there's your answer.
this place is off the beaten path.
her mother said she snuck out late.
he must have followed her here from her house.
which suggests he may not have planned the abduction.
he just waited for the right opportunity.
look at this.
she left her cell phone behind.
odd for a teenage girl.
maybe she lost it in the struggle.
or it's a forensic countermeasure so they can't be tracked with the GPS.
Garcia got a hit on ViCAP.
the day before yesterday two masked gunman robbed a pawn shop in Chicago.
25K in cash and jewels were stolen.
the owner and a customer were shot dead.
and so was one of the gunmen, except he was shot 8 times with a . 45.
emptied the magazine. Overkill?
you think our guy's the shooter?
the dead gunman was one Christopher Corbone.
he spent 6 years in the same cell block with Eddie Lee Wilcox.
they were partners.
and Corbone was heavily connected to the Riggio family in Chicago.
mid-level Mafioso thug.
sounds like a double-cross.
if he double-crossed his partner, he's not just on the run from the law, he could also be running from the mob.
that explains why the need to grab his daughter was so urgent.
with good guys and bad guys on his tail, he has to know that this doesn't end well.
it doesn't make sense.
if he loves her so much, why put her in this type of jeopardy?
his desperation's making him irrational.
he's gonna get dangerous if he gets cornered.
I can't tell for sure, but I'm almost positive it's that fella on the news.
Yes, sir.
can you describe the vehicle he's driving?
how much longer till we get there?
uh, not long.
a few more hours.
a few as in like 3 or like 7?
Yeah. Yeah, he sure is.
I need a shower. I stink.
it would have been nice if I could have packed a change of clothes.
I want you to take a walk to that diner up the road.
grab us some sandwiches, a couple slices of pie.
can't we just drive there when we get done?
we shouldn't be seen together.
plus I gotta hit the head, number 2.
it might take a while.
OK, ok. But way too much information.
what do you want?
surprise me.
Hey, the girl just went and walked off.
is he leaving with her?
he looks like he's going around back to the bathroom.
all right, sir. You sit tight.
we have state patrol units en route to you.
don't try any-- Hello?
Hello?
Hey, you there?
hotter than hell out there.
Yeah, that time of year.
Yeah. That comes to $6. 00 even.
pulse is stable at 86.
retractor, please.
is it true what I heard about this guy?
Yeah.
serial killer almost stabbed him to death.
crazy, huh?
let's have 4 units of 0-neg on hold.
Hi, honey. I saved you a seat.
no news on Hotch yet.
Samantha Wilcox was in touch with her dad a lot.
I got their texts right here.
may I? - Yeah.
Thanks.
I hate my life. Mom's a bitch.
hubby's a tool, and Wichita blows. Why can't I live with you?
then dad responds in kind,"love you lots. We'll be together soon.
she wanted him to come get her.
Yeah, what if they planned it?
I don't know. I'm not seeing anything logistical in nature here.
it's all emotional outbursts at her mom and little loving missives to her dad.
I doubt if she had anything to do with this, though.
name's Damon Turner, 54-year-old widower, father of 3, and apparently he was expecting is first grandchild.
no security cameras.
he had a shotgun stashed back there.
I wonder why he didn't use it.
Eddie must have gotten the jump on him before he could.
guy recognizes Eddie, calls 911.
Eddie clocks it, caps him to shut him up.
but the damage is already done.
he already made the call.
why kill him?
why didn't Eddie just take off?
he's in survival mode. He'll try to eliminate any perceived threats.
he didn't rob the place. He left all the cash in the register.
he didn't have to. He had money from the Chicago robberies.
actually, I think he may have.
look at this. Several items were rung up after the 911 call.
a bag of chips, a pack of gum, and 6 post cards.
post cards?
what does he want, a souvenir?
it's possible.
he knows if he gets caught, he's going away for a long time, and being with his daughter may have evoke a need to commemorate the event.
but post cards are old school.
being with his daughter might actually make him nostalgic in some way.
well, he's headed due south, most likely straight to Mexico.
he'll stick to side roads and won't cross the border anywhere busy.
I'll extend the AMBER Alert and have Highway Patrol set up roadblocks.
pulse is stable at 86.
more suction, please. - Yes, doctor.
you look so beautiful.
I miss you. - I know.
Ooh, it's starting.
Oh, look how happy he is.
who's that? - Her name is Beth.
he's gotten so big.
Oh, she's really good-looking.
she's not you.
and I'm not enough.
Oh, stop beating yourself up.
you're a great dad.
you always have been.
it's hard. And I'm alone. - No, you're not.
Jack misses you, too.
well, then you should talk about me more.
you should talk more, period.
he's not like you.
he needs to hear the words.
go! Go. Go! Go!
goal!
as you all know, Eddie Lee Wilcox is armed and dangerous.
he's also smart and criminally sophisticated.
he knows police procedure and how to use it.
reid: He's flush with cash from his robbery in Chicago, but he'll try to maintain a low profile, so he may resort to his robbery skills at some point.
Eddie's a car thief and he's a good one.
so he'll switch vehicles often.
he was last seen in a Chevy minivan, but we do not count on him being in it for long.
Morgan: So canvass crowded parking lots and malls.
that's most likely where he'll ditch cars and find new ones.
we've been calling this a child abduction, but Eddie's daughter Samantha may actually be an unwitting participant.
we know she wanted to run away from home, and her father is somehow taking advantage of that.
Morgan: This guy's evolved into a sociopathic spree killer, and he's got the ego of a career criminal, so there's no telling how far he'll go to save himself.
that ego may be feeding a sort of pipe dream, that if he does escape, he may actually get to have a healthy relationship with his daughter.
JJ: A relationship he believes was taken from him.
but when reality sets in, his dream will be shattered, and that's when Samantha will be in the most danger.
the majority of these cases end in either murder/suicide or suicide by cop.
up to this point, we've been reacting to him, but the roadblocks and the media blitz are set up to make him react to us.
so if you spot him, call for backup and proceed with extreme caution.
he's probably sleep deprived and irrational.
the closer we get, the more dangerous he becomes.
we have an AMBER Alert for 16-year-old Samantha Renee Wilcox of Wichita.
Samantha was allegedly abducted by her father, Eddie Lee Wilcox, who is wanted in connection with a robbery in Chicago that claimed the lives of 3 victims.
Sam! What are you doing?!
I was calling mom. They don't think that I ran away.
they think you kidnapped me.
no, no, no, no, no.
we talked about this. You can't call anybody.
I just wanted to let her know I was ok.
how long were you on the phone?
is it true?
did you tell her where we were?
did you kill those people?
what? - I saw it on the news.
get dressed. - No, no, answer my question!
I'll tell you everything in the car, but we gotta go.
no, please, just tell me the truth.
now, Sam! Now!
go!
this guy's not coming.
mm, we really haven't been here that long.
Yeah, but if he wanted to make a run for the border, he'd have been caught in the net by now.
maybe we made him switch directions.
well, we can't cover everything.
Texas is huge.
268, 581 square miles, to be exact.
largest state in the contiguous 48 and the second-most populous.
don't mess with Texas.
Hey, you want to read? I always do when I'm anxious.
the Magical Mathematics of Quantum Physics.
Nope. I'm good.
I'll wait for the movie.
here. Put your hair up.
you said you would explain when we got in the car.
we're in the car.
whoever's car this is.
I didn't do what they said that I did.
then what did you do?
Ah, jeez--I, uh-- my partner went crazy.
I was lucky to get out alive.
what happened?
it all went down so quick and didn't have choice, but I never should have trusted him.
did you kill anyone?
Sam-- Did you kill anyone?!
Sam! Look...
everything that I am doing I am doing for us.
everything's gonna be ok when we get to Mexico.
you just gotta trust me.
can you do that?
Yes. - That's my girl.
now please put the hat on, ok?
break 1-9.
anybody with their ears on, we got 1043s on every boulevard due south.
Smokeys are checkin' brakes. Be advised.
10-4, neighbor, thanks for the holler.
damn it!
what? - Change of plan.
Hey, what you got, good-lookin'?
still nothing on Hotch.
I have a sort of something on Samantha Wilcox.
she just called her mom from a motel in Odessa, but they weren't...
that's only 103 miles west of here.
alert local PD. We're on our way.
wait, wait, wait. I already did that.
I called the police and Samantha and her dad are nowhere to be seen.
sorry, sugar.
he won't like the idea of her calling home.
that phone call will probably drive a wedge between the two of them.
we're close and he knows it.
maybe he'll make a mistake.
what are we doing?
we need a new car.
sit tight. - Ok.
what the hell you doin'?!
what do you think you're doin'?!
dad
Oh, please... Sam!
get the bag. Get the bag.
go!
get in the truck.
you drive.
drive. Go, go.
OK. Look at this.
it's messier than we thought.
whoa, pressure's dropping. 80 over 50.
she's cute.
excuse me.
Ah...Sorry.
Ooh, ooh, pardon me.
I hope I didn't miss anything.
what's he doing here?
Oh, it's ok.
I invited him.
Wowza.
she is hot.
isn't she?
I would tear that up.
Hey, I bet she's a real tiger in the sack, huh?
Ooh, popcorn? - No.
would you like some?
Yes, thank you.
Ah, he's in V-fib.
pressure's still dropping.
get the paddles ready.
charge to 150.
charging to 150.
clear.
no, no, no, no. I need more pressure. Somebody help me! Help me, please!
would you pipe down a little bit?
Haley, I'm sorry. This is all my fault.
Oh, my God. Come on.
I can't stop the bleeding. I can't stop the bleeding!
it's ok.
you're not supposed to.
she's right.
so can we watch the show?
thank you.
well, they left in a hurry.
owner says they were here less than an hour.
and none of the motel guests saw anything.
take a look at this robbery footage.
JJ: Chicago PD apologized for the delay.
Rossi: Clearly not the first time they've done this.
this the only angle we got?
cameras inside weren't working.
muzzle flashes.
and they argue.
what about, though?
shooting the people inside wasn't part of the plan.
this is where it gets good.
the gun jammed.
that explains the overkill.
he didn't double-cross his partner, his partner double-crossed him.
Hey, girl. Got you on speaker. What's up?
Hey, an unidentified male was just found shot and killed at a truck stop parking lot outside of El Paso.
sure that's our guy?
well, a Mustang was reported stolen less than a mile from your current location.
it's in the same lot.
he's on the border.
he wouldn't cross there, though. It's too busy.
go back through his life again, Garcia.
he's feeling the heat, so he's gonna default to something familiar.
the answer's in there somewhere.
done and done.
any word on Hotch?
still no news, but I'm about to rouse the nurses for some intel.
you go get 'em, girl.
Sam, are you ok?
I just keeping seeing that guy that you shot.
he probably would have killed me if I hadn't have done that.
then I'd be on ice and you would be halfway home.
everything is gonna be ok, kiddo.
I promised I would always take care of you.
I meant it.
I will never leave you again.
OK.
OK. My money says this guy caught Eddie trying to steal his car.
there's a struggle, but Eddie gets the upper hand, shoots him in the gut, and then drags him over there.
and he takes his wallet, not because he needs money but so we can't I. D. him as quickly.
cause the minute we do, we know exactly What kind of car they're driving.
Hey, break it down, baby girl.
OK, here we go.
Eddie's story is way more tragic than we thought.
we know his mom died in childbirth and his dad committed suicide.
what we didn't know was that he's the one who found his father's dead body.
he was only 5.
Yeah. The postman called the cops when he smelled something horrible.
turns out that little kindergarten-sized Eddie was in the house with the corpse for two days, and it was in the middle of a crazy heat wave, so...
wait a minute, Garcia. Eddie's father died February 2.
uh, correctamundo.
the average temperature in Chicago in February is 26 degrees Fahrenheit.
Oh, no, they weren't in Chicago.
the were in Los Angeles because his father had a job opportunity that fell through, which he apologized for in his suicide note that he wrote on a stack of post cards.
are you sure they drove?
Yeah.
because the post cards were from stops they made along the way.
I think I know where they might be headed.
I can't get his pressure up.
it's 80 over 40.
one more mg. of EPI and we need that 0-neg.
Haley, I'm sorry.
this is all my fault.
that was awesome.
well, it's time to go.
I gotta go take a leak.
I'll meet you guys in the lobby, all right?
OK.
well, this was fun.
I don't want you to go.
what about Jack? And Beth?
they need you now more than ever.
just a little while longer?
there's no time.
please?
you have to go back now.
I want to stay with you.
I know you're the big boss man, but you can't always have your way, you know.
sometimes you just have to roll with it.
I don't know how.
happiness is a choice.
so choose.
but how? How do I choose?
get out of your head.
the heart is the one that knows, so follow it.
nice car.
Hey, what gives? I thought were were gonna meet in the lobby.
Oh, anybody gonna catch the subway downtown?
I hear it's gonna be a hot one.
no? All right, then.
this was great.
we gotta do this again.
come here, big guy.
take care of yourself, all right?
jeez Louise, loosen up a little bit.
would it kill you to smile?
seriously.
Beth's a keeper.
and Jack really likes her.
so don't screw it up.
goodbye, Aaron.
and, yes, I still love you, too.
Sam. Wake up.
check it out.
it looks just like it did when my dad took me here when I was a kid.
it's beautiful.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
hang on.
get out of the car, Sam. Get out of the car. Get out of the car!
here.
what are you doing?! - Stay back!
dad, you're crazy! - Get back!
I'll shoot! Stay back!
I'll blow her brains out! I swear to God!
stay back! - Stop it!
go! Go! Go!
I said get back!
I'll shoot!
get back or I'll shoot her!
Hi, sir.
welcome back.
do you feel ok? Do you need anything?
what happened?
uh, you collapsed and they performed emergency surgery because you were bleeding internally.
the doctor said it had something to do with the stabbing.
but you're fine.
there were some complications with the operation, but you're--you're ok.
I mean, you're like as healthy as a puma, a bedridden puma.
but my point is you're gonna be fine.
Where's Jack?
he's at home with Jessica. Shall I send for him?
please.
and I need my phone.
thank you.
I need to call Beth.
OK. Uh, so I'm gonna... Call Jessica and let the team know you're ok.
I'm sorry. - It's ok.
sir, I'm sorry.
I'm just--I'm-- I'm really happy you're back.
you had us worried sick.
Garcia... Thank you for staying.
wild horses, sir.
just wild horses.
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
I would never-- I would never hurt you.
why did you do that?
I'm so sorry.
I did not mean to scare you.
you said you were gonna blow my brains out!
I just needed some time to think, baby.
I just needed-- I needed a little time.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Eddie Lee Wilcox, this is the FBI.
we can work this out, but you have to let Samantha go.
come on, she's your daughter.
do the right thing, Eddie.
has he said anything yet?
not a word.
statistically speaking, the longer this takes the worse his daughter's chances get.
I don't know.
if he was gonna do something to her, he would have done it by now.
but now he's trapped. The game's changed.
I'm gonna try something.
what are you doing, Dad? -I don't know. I don't know.
pick up the phone, man.
we only want to help you.
come on, think about Samantha.
what?
Hi, Eddie?
this is Agent Jareau with the FBI.
you can call me Jennifer.
what do you want?
same as you.
I want Samantha safe.
she's fine.
can you, uh, put her on the phone so I can hear for myself?
go ahead.
Samantha? - Yeah.
you ok? - Yeah.
is there anything you guys need?
for you to get the hell out of here.
you know I can't do that, Eddie.
but I can help get your daughter to safety.
look, Eddie, I know all you've ever wanted is for her to be happy and safe.
does she look happy to you?
and there's a bunch of police out here with guns.
her safety's definitely an issue.
Eddie, I know why you took her to the ocean.
you wanted one last trip.
same as you had with your dad.
I know exactly how you feel.
and how do I feel, Jennifer?
what is she talking about?
I lost someone, too, once, the same way you did.
don't talk like you know me. You don't know me.
my sister.
when I was 11, she, uh, cut her wrists with one of my dad's razor blades.
I found her in the bathtub the next morning.
shut up!
don't make Samantha feel the same way we did.
it will change her, forever, the same way it did us.
shut up, damn it!
I said shut up, damn it!
he's not coming out.
SWAT should get ready.
Sam, you gotta go.
what?
I love you so much.
more than you will ever know.
dad... - You're the only good thing I ever did.
dad, please... - Oh, I'm so sorry for this.
but you got your whole life.
so, baby, you gotta go.
what are you gonna do?
he lets her go, he either shoots himself or shoots his way out.
baby, please.
you gotta go. Get out!
there she is.
Sam. Sam. Sam. - I am not leaving.
no, I'm not leaving.
I know what you're gonna do.
and you promised you would never leave me again.
they are gonna lock me up and throw away the key.
I don't care.
at least I can-- at least I can visit you and I can write you letters.
Why?
all I ever do is lie and I screw up.
that is all-- that is all I ever do.
no.
there was no job in Mexico.
there was nothing.
I'm nothing.
I don't want to leave you. I won't.
so, please... Don't leave me.
look.
no, no. - It's ok, it's ok.
no, no! No! No! No! No, no, Dad!
dad! - It's ok.
excuse me.
sir, you have a visitor.
dad!
easy.
you ok?
I am now.
"life is a dream. Realize it." Mother Teresa.
Oh, please...
please.
Oh, please...
please!
please! No
thank you.
OK, just put everything on the counter and I'll put it away later.
I like your altar. Thank you.
Yeah, there's still a lot to do before the party next week, and...
I'm scared. I've never had the whole team here before.
why are you doing a Day of the Dead theme?
well, uh, my stepfather's family always made a big deal of it in Mexico, and my name is Penelope Garcia, after all, so...
Hey, could you check my refrigerator and see if I have enough hot sauce?
you have some jalapeno sauce here next to this jar of eyeballs, but I think you're gonna need more, depending on which guacamole you plan on making.
you ok?
you didn't even flinch.
JJ's right. I told her I wanted to go scary this Halloween, and she just laughed at me and she said that I don't have a scary side.
I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, you probably do.
Really? Yeah.
the building blocks of the human personality are complex, varied, and multi-faceted. It's essential to one's mental health to want to express these hidden personalities, and it's a fact of nature that everybody has one.
everybody? You have one?
Oh, absolutely. Yeah.
OK. Ok. I want to see it.
I want to see Dr. Spencer Reid's hidden personality.
Uh-you, uh- right here? Like right now you want to see it?
I have fake blood running down my cheeks right here, right now.
OK.
once you see it, you can't unsee it.
OK.
I know what you're thinking.
you're thinking, did that guy just fire 5 shots?
or did that guy just fire 6 shots?
you're gonna have to ask yourself a question.
do you feel lucky, punk?
that's Clint Eastwood, in "Dirty Harry.
I mean, I know it's not as effective as my dominant personality, but I feel like there's- Hey, look, we gotta go.
these eyeballs, do they need to be refrigerated- No. Let's go.
Oh, I recognize that face from somewhere.
it's good to have you back, Hotch. It's good to be back. Thanks.
and under the heading of no rest for the weary...
a woman was found dead yesterday near Provo, Utah, buried under a pile of rocks.
her face was smashed. Her head was smashed.
pretty much everything smashed.
24 hours????
no personal items were found at the scene, and the severity of her injuries made official recognition impossible.
so Provo missing persons has like zero intel on her. Well, it looks like the victim was tortured.
lacerations on both arms and a burn in the neck area.
it could be the killer's way of silencing her, literally and figuratively.
the robe she's in almost looks ceremonial.
Yeah, the unsub must have changed her clothing. Could be a straight-up woman hater.
took away her clothes, her voice, her identity. And then covered her with rocks.
might be a concealment or an expression of remorse.
it looks like a makeshift tomb, if you ask me.
have there been similar killings in the area?
none that we know. I'm impressed, Hotch.
how'd you get the brass to let us investigate a single, isolated murder?
I told them that the ritualistic nature means that he's forensically sophisticated and organized and he's likely killed before. And likely will kill again.
which means we can't waste time. Wheels up in 20.
after all, what is every man but a horde of ghosts...
oaks that were acorns that were oaks.
Walter de la Mare.
single victim, unidentified.
not much to go on. Let's start with the basics.
those rocks were heavy, so our killer's most likely male, probably in good physical shape.
there could be more than one unsub.
newsflash. We just got lucky with dental records.
our Jane Doe is Gloria Carlyle, 24-year-old grammar school teacher.
one red flag, and it's pretty Scarlet, carmine, crimson.
she used to belong to a utopian-style sect in town.
she joined it right out of high school. Used to belong?
Mm-hmm. She left the sect 3 months ago and she moved in with her boyfriend.
do we know the boyfriend's whereabouts?
he's in Alaska, so his alibi's as solid as a pre-globally-warmed glacier.
Garcia, is this sect run by a man named Herbert Sykes?
wonder boy, yes, it is. How'd you know that?
5 years ago a teenage girl was found dead on the grounds of his compound.
it was determined to be an honor killing of sorts. The girl was stoned to death.
the rocks appear to be the cause of death in Gloria's murder as well.
the red flag just got redder.
all right, Dave, you and Blake find out what you can about Gloria Carlyle from the medical examiner.
morgan and Reid, go to the crime scene. JJ and I will talk to Gloria's family as well as have a chat with Herbert Sykes.
Provo, UTAH
a couple of fossil hunters nosing around up here found her.
those the rocks?
my men moved them off her body.
but that's all anyone's touched them.
these are sedimentary conglomerates with rounded clasts. If you say so.
that means that geologically speaking, they don't belong up here.
the rest of this canyon is tertiary rhyolite volcanics, which means the unsub must have brought these rocks with him.
which would be noisy and time-consuming.
so the unsub obviously felt comfortable enough up here to take the time that he needed.
he's probably been here before.
sergeant, how wide was the radius of your initial search?
we canvassed out about 200 yards in all directions.
we didn't find anything.
well, we may need to push that out a little further.
I was, uh, shocked when I heard.
even though Gloria chose to leave the community, her loss will be felt.
we spoke to Gloria's parents a little while ago and they said that you had had a fight with Gloria the day that she left the community.
this had something to do with your claim of divine heritage?
I am the spiritual leader of my community.
as such, I often speak allegorically or in parables.
but Gloria took the divine heritage business literally.
Yes. She dug around in my family history looking for, uh...
who knows what.
God, Buddha... Zeus.
we were also told that Gloria was threatened by members of the community when she announced her intention to leave. I have no knowledge of that.
so the friends she made there weren't told to shun her?
let's talk about the stoning death 5 years ago.
since you seem to know the answers to the questions you're asking, why don't you tell me?
look, the guilty party was sent to prison, where he belongs.
what else do you want to know? Reviewing the original case file, you were less than forthcoming in the initial stages of the investigation.
you hired a public relations firm in the wake of the murder.
it took me years to build my community.
my investment was- is substantial.
I was not going to watch it go under because of one tragic incident.
I think we're done.
we may have some more questions, so please keep yourself available for the next few days.
the law firm of Gordon, Foxman, and Mendelovich.
not local yokels- Wall Street.
drag my name through the mud on this like you did 5 years ago, and they'll be in touch.
Mr. Sykes, we're investigating a murder, and I don't speak in parables, so this should be very easy to understand.
if you interfere with us in any way, I will see to it that you are charged with and prosecuted for obstruction of justice.
I've seen some bad ones in my 15 years, but this was... bad.
what was the C. O.D? It's hard to pinpoint.
virtually every bone in her body was crushed and every major organ ruptured.
my guess is skull fracture, but honestly, any one of these internal injuries might have killed her.
what about the lacerations? Could they have been defensive wounds?
no, they were in a distinct pattern.
quite deep and severe on the radius and ulna, but carefully placed so as not to cause death.
there would be substantial bleeding from a wound like that?
Absolutely.
yet there was minimal blood at the crime scene.
the victim suffered the lacerations and burning somewhere else and was taken to the canyon to be killed.
but why not make it one-stop shopping?
transporting her alive, even a short distance, would increase the risk significantly.
the tox report did show traces of chlorpromazine in her system.
a tranquilizer. That's what he used to control her.
there's something else I wanted you to see.
fingernail polish was removed. But crudely.
a mixture of citrus juice and vinegar.
and where that didn't do the trick, the polish was roughly scraped off with a sharp object.
not how I remember my ex-wives removing their polish.
well, this was done to her, not by her.
what used to be up here? The dirt road leading in seems rather substantial.
salt mining. Hauled this stuff out by the truckloads.
these hills filled a hell of a lot of salt shakers.
actually, less that 6% of salt in the United States is used for food. The vast majority of it goes for de-icing roads and snow control.
guys.
over here.
you're right.
the killer's been here before.
and he seems to have a preference for blondes.
Kylie, this one looks good.
I like it. Me, too.
I think we could find something in here for sure.
should we check it out, then? Yeah.
OK. Let's go.
sorry, ma'am. That's a reference book.
it can't leave the library. Not even for one night?
no, ma'am. But there is a photocopy machine on the main floor if you want to make copies. 10 cents a page.
can we make copies?
you know what, sweetie? I gotta get ready for work.
but we'll come back tomorrow. Thank you.
you promise? Promise.
I hate when people can't be flexible.
I mean, who is it gonna hurt to take the book for one night?
how much is this book?
excuse me?
to buy it. How much to buy the book?
this is a library, sir, not a bookstore. Let's go, sweetie.
whoa, hold on, lady.
don't touch me.
I'll make the photocopies for you.
give me your phone number and we can set up a time to
time to go, sweetie.
Dave, are you and Blake still at the M. E.'s office? Just leaving now.
Yeah, stay put. Morgan and Reid found another body near the first crime scene.
22-year-old Abby Stafford. She was a student at the University of Utah.
quick I. D.
Yeah, her handbag was found near the body. Any idea when she died?
morgan said the body's been there for a while.
her roommate says that she's been missing for a week.
the body's on its way to you now. Another rock burial?
it appears she jumped or was thrown off of a cliff.
the autopsy's tomorrow, but the M. E. might be able to tell us something now.
OK, we'll stay put. By the way, have you had your audience yet with the Dalai Lama?
Yeah. He claims to know nothing about the Gloria Carlyle murder.
surprise, surprise. What's your take, Hotch?
well, I think he's telling the truth. You sound fairly certain.
Yeah, money means more to Sykes than ideology.
he took a big financial hit after the stoning death a few years ago.
the last thing he wants is any more trouble. Protecting his brand.
utopia incorporated. We'll check in when the new body gets here.
Thanks.
I'm sorry I grabbed you before.
leave me the hell alone or I'm gonna go back inside and call security.
it's not against the law to apologize. It's called stalking.
and it is against the law. Stop following me.
you need to calm down. I mean it.
if I see you again, I'm calling the cops.
JJ, were you able to contact Abby Stafford's family?
no. They're vacationing somewhere in Europe.
we're tracking them down. But I did talk to a friend of hers.
she said Abby was a conservative, studious type.
no drama. No enemies. I just got off the phone with Rossi.
the M. E. says the new victim died roughly a week ago.
had the same laceration marks and throat burning, but the wounds weren't anywhere near as severe as Gloria Carlyle's.
he was still warming to the task.
well, our unsub definitely has a type.
young, blond, pretty.
now, the elements in common to both murders aren't giving us much.
let's concentrate on the deviations.
OK. Well, um, Abby was thrown off a cliff.
Gloria was entombed.
the unsub left Abby in her own clothes but changed Gloria into a robe.
the M. E. found another difference.
apparently Gloria's fingernail polish had been removed by the unsub.
Abby Stafford's hadn't been tampered with at all.
well, Abby's death was quick and impersonal- of the cliff.
no muss, no fuss. But Gloria was slowly crushed.
he took his time to make her suffer.
all the deviations in Gloria's murder involve increased ritual.
it's got to be feeding a fantasy of some kind.
it explains why the torture was more intense with Gloria.
the ritual fed the fantasy, the fantasy fed the rage.
if that's the case, this guy's evolving fast.
no...
the hour is upon us.
with this, I send your soul back to hell.
no
Thanks.
same signature. Lacerations.
burned throat. He's dressed in a robe.
but this is a huge change in both M. O. and victimology.
well, we knew the unsub probably wouldn't chance going to the canyon again, but a downtown city park?
it's a complete 180.
Garcia, what's the lowdown on Parker Mills? Oh, you got the low part right.
do you remember in science class with the petri dishes and the mold and the algae and the slime and the gunk?
Yeah, I appreciate the scientific perspective, but what are you saying?
I'm saying grade-a pervert.
there is not a ladies underwear drawer that this man did not want to dive face-first in.
so I'm guessing a rap sheet?
as long as the telescope he used to peer into the girls locker room.
if it is something scuzzy, Parker Mills has done it.
peeping Tom, a stalk, non-consensual frottage, which, BTW, is rubbing your body on, near, or against the vicinity of somebody else's
let me call you back, Garcia. Hey, check this out.
this burn was shallow and more distinct.
there's a pattern.
a design.
the victims weren't just being burned.
they're being branded.
so this guy's killing men now.
Parker Mills must have had a hidden or perceived connection to the other victims.
or Mills got in the way somehow and had to be killed so the unsub could return to his preferred victim type.
then why bother with the cutting and throat burning?
excuse me.
interesting. What is it?
tox report on Abby Stafford.
our conservative, studious girl had cocaine in her system at the time of her death.
we're looking for a physically fit male from his late 20s to mid 30s.
he's brazen, confident, and organized.
this person may be a moral vigilante.
Abby Stafford had drug issues. Gloria Carlyle moved in with her boyfriend.
Parker Mills was a sexual deviate.
moral vigilantism typically has its roots in repression and guilt.
this generally manifests itself in low self-esteem and self-loathing.
by punishing others, the unsub may also be punishing himself.
he's also literally branding his victims.
we're not sure why, but he's likely marking them as his own.
his organizational skills suggest someone who can get and keep a full-time job.
but the work is likely low level.
his impaired social development would not allow him to move very far in the professional world.
consequently, this is someone working in solitude, having minimal interaction with others.
and this makes it a challenge to determine how and where this person is choosing his victims.
the two female victims were reserved and studious.
Parker Mills lived quietly in the margins of conventional society.
so the killer may frequent or work in locations that attracts this type of person.
uh, places of solitude, contemplation.
museums, gardens and parks, bookstores.
his choice of a city square rather than a remote canyon means he's gaining confidence.
but the recklessness of killing in such a public space suggests that this confidence may be stemming from a delusion.
he may believe he's in a place and time that makes him invulnerable.
and if his delusion is gaining in strength, then his next killing may be riskier and more dramatic.
thank you.
I told Dr. Reid he could use my office.
there must be 30 books piled up on my desk.
well, that's either some light bedtime reading or he's actually onto something.
you know, I was thinking about that branding thing.
maybe it's like that book we had to read in school, about the woman with the Scarlet A.
no, that's unlikely.
the Scarlet letter was a badge of shame to be worn in public day after day.
our unsub is killing his victims immediately after the branding.
there's something strange going on here.
well, that may be the understatement of the week.
Gloria's vision was extremely poor. Her driver's license specifies she had to wear corrective lenses while operating a vehicle.
Eyeglass. It says here she wore contact lenses.
no contact lenses were found on her body or at the crime scene.
the unsub must have taken them out, like he removed her nail polish.
but why would he do that?
no wristwatch was found at the crime scene either.
nail polish, wristwatch, contact lenses.
what if he was trying to strip her of items that reminded him of the modern era?
it could be part of his delusion. Like changing her into a simple robe.
he needed to take Gloria back to a primitive time before he could kill her.
Leland, there you are.
you need to get your new parking permit downstairs.
OK. As soon as my shift's over. No, do it now.
you keep putting it off and today's the last day.
I'll watch your area until you get back.
what have you got? - Guys, check this out.
the pattern in the branding mark has design characteristics similar to family crests from the late middle ages.
I found this encyclopedia of heraldry and look.
it's the seal of William Stoughton, a Magistrate.
check when and where he's a Magistrate.
Salem, Massachusetts, 1692.
Stoughton was the lead prosecutor in the Salem Witch trials.
so this unsub believes he's hunting witches.
where is it? Where's what?
the book!
the book that was right there.
where is it? It's been checked out.
what? A woman came in while you were gone, said you told her yesterday that it was a reference book and couldn't be checked out.
this is a lending library. Remember?
don't worry. Yeah, but
I logged the book into the system and gave it to her.
...little cotton balls on it.
next week I think we're gonna make little fish with gills that sparkle.
here, I'll carry the book.
got it?
OK.
our unsub chose the right role model.
Stoughton was the most ruthless of all of the Salem prosecutors.
our killer's also emulating the methods of execution at the time of the trials.
witches were thrown off cliffs, hung, slowly crushed by rocks.
so the family crest thing, is that his way of honoring the guy?
it's more than that. He may believe he's a direct descendent of Stoughton.
Garcia, were you able to run a history yet of the Stoughton family tree?
it isn't so much a tree as it is a giant sequoia
branches, twigs, roots, sticks, limbs, pine cones, woodpecker holes.
there are literally thousands of Stoughton's descendents out there.
are there any in the Provo or Salt Lake city area?
Yeah, there's a handful, but none of them fit the unsub's profile.
can you send me the Stoughtons' ancestry chart?
did you hear the part I said about the giant Sequoia?
I can send it to you, but unless your laptop screen is the size of a drive-in movie theater
send it anyway. We'll print out a hard copy here.
I'm going to send the side of the tree that migrated westward, and do not say I did not warn you.
you're going to need a bigger copy machine.
hon... Baby?
where are we?
by the grace of the defenders of the faith, "these two did engage in the detestable arts called witchcraft and sorcery.
what?
these sorceries were wickedly and feloniously used against others.
what are you talking about? "For such delving into witchcraft...
witchcraft? Is this statute made and provided.
no. No, this is crazy.
please, just let us go. W- wait.
don't hurt us. No, don't hurt us.
you're making a mistake.
don't.
no. No! Don't hurt us!
I've learned to stop asking questions about this guy.
what's up, Spence?
there's something strange about this one branch of the family tree.
talk to me. I am fluent in genius.
Roy and Becky Danary, they died in 1985, leaving behind a son named William Danary, but there's no record of what happened to him.
the Danarys were Peace Corps workers in Ecuador.
they died in a car accident there.
and you're right, their kid just sort of vanished.
let me do some digging and I will call you back.
all right, well, we profiled the unsub as delusional.
what if Stoughton being a great-great-great-whatever is just part of his delusion?
or the discover of being a direct descendent triggered the delusion.
he looked into his ancestry. That would be easy to do here.
salt Lake City has the largest family history library in the world.
Gloria Carlyle researched Herbert Sykes' ancestry.
Abby Stafford was a bookish college student.
maybe that's where they crossed-at a library.
JJ, have Garcia get the names of all the employees and volunteers in the Provo and Salt Lake City library system and cross-check those with descendents of William Stoughton.
who are you?
is that was this is about, the book?
take it. I don't want it.
I'm just making my daughter a costume for Halloween.
that's all. We were just looking at the book for ideas.
do you confess your crimes? What crimes?
what are you talking about?
the court will be merciful if you confess.
I didn't do anything!
Oh, baby.
listen to me. Just let my daughter go.
she's innocent. Just...
let her go, and...
and you and I, we could talk, ok?
the indictment accuses both of you.
do you willingly confess to your crimes?
or must a confession be extracted from you?
you're crazy!
Hey, I have a thing. - What is it, Garcia?
no library employees are direct descendents of William Stoughton. However, there's a volunteer with a fascinating family history there.
Leland Duncan, son of Orland and Clara Duncan, Mormon missionaries.
but the Duncans aren't part of the Stoughton lineage.
but, a big kiss to who can guess where they were doing their missionary work in 1985.
ecuador. Ding, ding, we have a winner.
same time and place as the Peace Corps couple that died and left a son.
so the Duncans adopted the boy and changed his name.
I'm sending you a current photo of Leland Duncan along with his home address. There.
Thanks.
it's clear here. Clear.
OK. Thanks.
apartment's empty, but Leland's definitely our guy.
book FAIR OCT 18 - Nov 3 PROVO ???
what are you doing?
the court needs your confessions first.
wait! Stop! No, I'll confess!
you don't have to do this.
I'll admit it.
I am a witch.
I'll call you back, Garcia.
victim's Charlotte Novak. She's one of the librarians.
when was she last seen alive?
around 3: 30. She came to the main circulation desk to put a book into the system, then she went back to Leland's section.
what was the book?
an Illustrated History of Witchcraft and Sorcery. " That was his lure.
and anyone who took the bait was guilty of being a witch.
Where's the book? Got checked out. Yvonne Carpenter.
all right, we need to find her address and send units there immediately.
was it my daughter? Your daughter?
was she the one who betrayed me?
your child is also a witch.
why would she help me?
no. She's a witch hunter.
like you. She tried to remove the curses
I put on people. You lie.
it's the truth.
I can prove it.
she has the mark of the angel.
it's on her hairline, just behind her left ear. Look.
you see it, don't you?
mark of the angel.
there's gotta be a secondary location somewhere.
I know, but Garcia said that Leland Duncan's adoptive parents never had an address in the area.
Garcia. Talk to me. What was Clara Duncan's maiden name?
Andrews. Clara Andrews. Did they ever live in the area?
I'm working on it. Give me a sec.
Yvonne Carpenter and her daughter are both gone.
my officer said the apartment showed signs of a struggle.
your daughter has been released from custody.
when she wakes up, she is free to go.
thank God.
the court accepts the confession of witchcraft. What?
your sentence of execution will be carried out at sundown.
No! You said you'd show mercy!
please don't do this!
Leland's adoptive mother, neither of her parents are still alive.
but get this- they owned property that is 2. 8 miles from the canyon crime scene.
who lives there now? Nobody.
it was condemned by the county 8 years ago. As far as I can tell, it's abandoned.
all right, send the coordinates to Rossi, Blake, and Morgan.
sending it. Thanks.
it is time.
No! No! Don't!
move aside!
let us pass!
guilty! She's guilty!
wait. Wait.
why is my daughter tied up?
you said she was free to go.
this is- You are a witch.
she is your daughter. It's in the blood.
No! The court promised mercy and you shall have it.
you will be burned first.
burned? No!
you'll be spared seeing your daughter suffer the flames.
No! No!
she's a little girl. She's never hurt anyone.
the accused have been convicted of the horrible crime of witchcraft...
and found guilty. No... No...
sentence will now be carried out.
please! Please don't do this!
No! Don't do this!
Leland Duncan! FBI!
set the torch down and lay flat on your stomach.
drop the torch now!
do it.
no. No, stay.
they're just phantoms...
conjured by these witches to confuse you!
get me untied. I'm coming.
get me down! Get me down... It's ok, I've got you.
you're gonna be ok. I've got you.
it's all right, baby. My baby, wake up.
wake up.
mom...
mommy...
so I looked it up.
no witches were ever burned at the stake in Salem. Really?
death by fire was strictly a European thing.
moral of the story: Be selective where you practice your witchcraft.
what, what, what?
I thought you couldn't come.
well, Jack got a last-minute sleep-over invitation, so I hope it's ok.
Yes, of course, of course.
and happy almost birthday. I will keep it on the D. L.
thank you.
OK, everybody, I guess it's time to start.
here you go, sir. Thank you.
uh... I want to thank everybody for doing this with me, and our altar's burning, and I just feel so blessed to have you all here.
I will start. Uh...
this is my mom and dad. I miss them.
and this is my cat Simba with his usual bowl of soda pop.
he's a weird cat. Ok. Who's next?
uh, ok. Well, uh, this is my sister Roslyn. Ros.
she always dreamt that someday she'd live in Paree, so, um... it didn't happen, but I thought this would bring her some happiness.
private First Class Darryl Jenson.
we lost him during the Tet offensive.
what are the tickets?
opening day next season, Wrigley, right behind the home dugout.
jenson was a diehard Cubs fan.
sweet.
my mom.
she was the one who got me into crossword puzzles
no erasing allowed
which got me into linguistics.
you said we could bring more than one, right?
Oh, yes. This is a come one, come all altar.
it's Nikola Tesla.
I figured he's probably been inventing things on the other side, so hopefully he'll bring something to us.
I guess that's me. Ok.
I brought...
my pops.
he was a cigar aficionado, big time.
and, actually, Rossi, he was also a huge Cubbies fan, so I was thinking maybe he and private Jenson over there, maybe they could go to the game together.
they can sort that out when they get here.
well, I guess this is proof positive that ancestry ain't all bad.
how about a toast to the...
30 or 40 of us?
Cheers.
Cheers. Cheers.
Salud.
Mitch Albom said, "Death ends a life, not a relationship.
stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
what are you doing?
I'm gonna be late for work.
the sun's not even up.
it is in London.
your job sucks.
well, it pays the bills.
Yeah, well, not mine. Turn out the light.
don't I get a kiss first?
no.
please?
one.
one is not enough.
call me. We'll talk.
you don't think I'll call.
I know you won't call. You'll text.
say, " sup? " Expect me to come over and have sex with you and go back home.
is it the entire male species that you have a low opinion of or is it just me?
just you.
I will call you tonight. I promise.
and I'll come back to you again.
good. Have fun at work.
dude...
Kara, listen.
I think I'm in love.
Scotty just left my place.
her name is Ashley.
the guy at the bar.
No,wait,it's not like that.There was a real connection.
what do you think? He just left.
I'm telling you, man, she's a game-changer.
no, I know, but it wasn't like that.
it was...real. - She has a thing for bunnies.
and when I say a thing, I mean she's seriously obsessed.
no, I will not tell you his shoe size.
right over there.
that's where I saw Carolyn the first time.
no offense, Rossi, but this place is kind of a dump.
Oh, back then it wasn't.
back then the biggest names would come here. Creedence, The Eagles, Chicago.
it was a Marine bar. They played for us jarheads.
what was Carolyn doing here? Waiting for Ringo.
Beatlemania was no joke. I mean, it would make the women crazy.
she'd write them a letter once a week, begging the band to come visit.
did they ever come?
ringo did, after his divorce.
but luckily, Carolyn met me first.
but that's how we all became friends.
devil honey for Dave.
and an Arnold Palmer for the kid.
on second thought, Helen-- it's Garcia.
so much for a night off.
you better bring us the bill.
OK. That'll be 10 bucks.
no, you can charge us for the drinks we didn't have.
everything's marked down until it's all gone.
Oh, you can't close. This place is history.
unfortunately, Dave, history doesn't pay the bills.
Marines used to be big business.
still are. That's why 3 new bars opened up across the street.
what's that thing they say about competition?
it breeds success? - It sucks.
Well...Keep the change.
thank you, Dave.
I hate to see this place go.
Beantown has turned into Chokeville. 3 victims, all male, wallets stolen.
the unsub uses a garrote to strangle his victims.
he strikes at night and there have been no witnesses.
how much did he get?
well, it's odd. Each of the victims, socio-economically, is lower to middle class.
it's doubtful there would have been much cash, and there have been no charge attempts on any of the credit cards.
so the murders might not be about money at all.
taking the wallets could be a forensic countermeasure so the murders might not to delay victim identification.
that could be the sitch with the first two victims, but the latest one, Scott Delfino, he was on the phone with his roommate when he was attacked, call cut out unexpectedly, repeated callbacks went straight to voicemail.
and Delfino's body was found an hour later. Indications were they'd been blitzed.
which speaks to the killer's prep work but also his desperation.
he chose a location to lay in wait but wasn't capable of adapting to a target on the phone.
that could be arrogance getting in the way and making his organization appear mixed.
to me that screams false confidence.
which means that desperation is what's driving him.
it's not about the kills, it's about what the murders represent.
he's mission oriented. He doesn't want to kill them, he has to.
which suggests the unsub has no personal connection to his victims.
except choking as a kill method is extremely personal.
he feels each victim take their last breath.
what if the wallets are a form of depersonalization?
he's stripping his victims of their identities.
which means he may feel stripped of his own.
if the wallets are trophies, he could be seeking recognition for his work.
and he may not stop killing until he gets that recognition.
let's go.
" if passion drives you, let reason hold the reins." Benjamin Franklin.
Ryan Maxford worked as a counselor at a local boys home, and Scott Delfino worked for Dynamo Industries, which is an international pharmaceutical firm.
besides gender, the victimology varies.
he doesn't care about age or race.
he blends in and is most likely unassuming.
yet has no problem taking down a 6'5," 260 pound man.
Maxford was a former football all-American.
which probably rules out my unsub as a woman who hates men theory.
it'd be hard to gain leverage on these guys.
true, but hatred of men might not be far off.
the victims could be surrogates.
for someone else or the unsub himself?
it's too early to tell.
if the unsub does feel stripped of his own identity, he could be trying to make these men appear the same way.
he could be recognizing in his victims a behavioral trait consistent with the object of his rage that triggers him to kill.
we need to determine where he's finding his victims.
geographically speaking, none of the victims live near one another, but they were all killed downtown, which is where the unsub likes to operate.
that fits with where Maxford works, but not with the other two victims.
his area of control, while relatively small, includes a number of residential and commercial buildings.
factoring in a 3 mile radius in a city with a population of 636, 479 over 48. 28 miles, we're looking at approximately 39, 549. 23 people living in his comfort zone.
how many of them male? - 18, 944. 08
Garcia, start with the victim's known associates.
we need a list of everyone who lives and works downtown.
on it. I'm a genius, too.
Morgan, Blake, and I will go to the field office and start with Garcia's list.
Dave, go to the M. E. and see what they can offer us.
JJ, you and Reid go to the scene where Scott Delfino's body was found.
his roommate's waiting to talk to you there.
is that a good idea, talking to him where his friend was murdered?
well, apparently he's insisting on it.
Boston P. D. says he won't leave the scene until you do.
Ben Harrison?
you the FBI?
I'm Agent Jennifer Jareau. This is Dr. Spencer Reid.
you know, we didn't have to do this here.
we could have talked back at our field office.
I wanted to see where it happened.
I was talking to him one second and then the...
that's it. Gone.
right here Scotty's story ends.
Scotty must have been coming from the east, otherwise the unsub's position would have left him exposed.
But?
that Avenue offers 3 different directions to head in lieu of this alleyway, so how did the unsub know Scotty was gonna choose this particular one?
you told the police he met a girl last night.
so walking home this way wouldn't be part of his regular routine, right?
no.
when planning a blitz attack with varying avenues of approach, what do you do?
eliminate the variable.
strike as close as you can to the point of origin or destination.
but Scotty was still miles away from home.
the woman he met lives nearby.
do you have any idea who she was?
only that her name is Ashley and she likes bunnies.
don't ask. It's the last thing he said to me.
do you know where they met?
I'm not sure.
we were watching the Pats came at the Purple Shamrock, and then I had to bail.
I have to pick up my girlfriend from Logan, so...
do you think Scotty stayed there, or would he have ventured elsewhere after you left?
I don't know. There's so many bars in the area.
Scotty had a tendency to...wander.
with women, you mean?
let's just say it wasn't often that he slept alone.
did that rub anyone the wrong way?
not anyone that knew him.
he was too good a guy not to like.
Boston FBI FIRLD OFFICE
What'd you find out?
we just talked to JJ.
Scott Delfino's roommate said something interesting.
apparently Delfino was a womanizer but was too good of a guy not to like.
we heard something similar from Ryan Maxford's family.
stand-up guy, but he was always broke and asking for money.
they would give it to him because despite his flaws, everybody loved him.
well, that fits Mike Dunsmore, too.
he spent a quarter of his income on marijuana, but he volunteered 5 morning a week at a soup kitchen.
it's a stretch, but could this be our link?
is the unsub targeting men based on their supposed character flaws?
he'd have to have stalked them well in advance.
why stalk someone you don't have a personal connection to?
because he's not targeting a specific person. He's targeting a specific type.
men he thinks are too good to be true.
what?
now, listen.
I landed the trick. I've seen you...
it was sloppy, though. Oh, well, it's better than your tricks.
wait up. Hey, stop.
Yeah, here, you pick up your board.
dude, put the cigarettes away.
Why?
my mom talked to Mrs. Herron yesterday.
she found out about the test?
Yeah, and the 3 before that. So now I'm grounded until the end of the semester.
that's like 6 weeks.
you don't think I know that?
she even took my PSP.
no games for a month and a half.
so unless you want your mom to do the same exact thing, I'd pocket those cigarettes.
you know what the problem is?
you can't miss the fight tonight. Without you, he'll kick all of our asses.
there's nothing I can do about it.
my PSP is locked up.
take mine. Don't let your mom see it.
we gotta play.
what about you?
parents at my brother's game tonight. I'll steal his.
that lady is so hot. - Right.
one of these days I'm gonna have the nerve to talk to her.
all right, man, I'm out.
all right, sweet. Text me when you get home.
Yeah. See you.
you know how many Ashleys there are in downtown Boston?
too many Ashleys...that's how many Ashleys.
and the only thing I have to track her down is she has a penchant for bunnies?
so, I'm pulling receipts from local pet shops. Nothing crosses.
and anyway, even if she likes bunnies, it doesn't mean she owns bunnies.
I like unicorns. I don't have any unicorns.
I feel like I'm on a trail led by wild geese and bunnies.
what about Scott's cell phone? He probably put Ashley's number in it before he died.
Yeah, that phone broke during the struggle.
I searched his cloud server, but his contacts hadn't updated yet.
we need to find her, Penelope.
Ashley might be able to identify the unsub, which means she could be at risk, too.
I know. I...you know what?
send me that broken cell phone.
I may be able to pull data from the device itself.
and in the meantime, forward Delfino's calls to us.
if she tries him, we'll be able to talk to her.
smart thinking, sensei. Routing it now.
Delfino put up a struggle, but there was nothing he could do.
killer had all the leverage.
can you tell what kind of garrote was used?
it varies.
first was fishing line, then picture wire. Now some kind of cable.
all common household items.
I'd say he's definitely making the weapons himself.
from the looks of it, learning quickly.
each wire was stronger than the last.
there's something else. He's cut a lock of hair off every victim.
something tells me that's more than an act of depersonalization.
he wants to remember these men and what he did to them.
anything yet? - Nothing.
typical asshat. - He's not, though.
how many times has a guy said he'd call and didn't? Too many.
he wasn't like that. You weren't there. Call him.
I can't.
you don't have his number.
that's how sure I was he would call.
rookie mistake.
we're out of wine.
told you we should've got another bottle.
we can always get more.
not this late. There's a killer on the street.
Oh, yeah, I saw something about that posted on campus.
just keep your focus.
look out, one's coming.
all right, uh...there's one in the rafters.
Oh, crap, I missed.
flank left. Flank left!
I'm trying,but Terrido's on my ass. - I got him in my sights.
so shoot him already or I'm toast. - Hold on one sec.
and now I'm dead. - But so is Terrido. And we win.
good for us. I'm still dead.
the needs of many, my friend.
so I'm collateral damage.
no, you can't think of it that way, Jake.
you're on the Sox and you just hit a sacrifice fly.
Yeah, I'll show you who the sacrifice is gonna be.
looks like your brother is about to bust you on his PSP.
Nah, he won't be back for another hour. We can play one more round.
then who's there with you?
no one. Why? Can you sneak out?
Jake, there's someone behind you.
what are you...Colin! - Jake?
mom! Help! Help! Mom! Jake's in trouble! Hurry!
a friend called it in. He lives down the street.
what kind of mission involves killing a teenage boy?
normally I would say this points to a devolution in the unsub's psyche.
he killed Jake in his own home. It's the first time he's been inside.
Why?
we've been canvassing the area pretty heavily.
maybe he's adapting to increased police activity.
he's a low-risk victim killed in his home.
it feels like the unsub knew he would be alone.
so he's not just stalking Jake, but his family, too.
as well as all his other victims.
he can't be everywhere at once.
maybe he's been planning this longer than we thought.
the time between kills is getting shorter.
but there's no indication that he's deriving increased pleasure from them.
well, it would make sense if he's feeling pressure from an outside agency.
maybe he's got a deadline.
you're sure you didn't catch a glimpse of him?
just movement in the background.
I tried to warn Jake, but...
did Jake see who was there? Did he say anything to you?
he saw him. I mean, the guy was right there.
and Jake was so scared.
I can't get his face out of my head.
it's OK.
I just have one more question. Do you think you can handle that?
Yeah.
OK.
did Jake seem like he recognized the man in his house?
what are you...Colin!
Yeah. Yeah, he knew him.
and I could see it on his face.
but he didn't say who it was.
just because you recognize someone doesn't necessarily mean you know them.
the man could simply be someone that Jake routinely passes on the street.
whoever he is, we're gonna get him.
OK? - OK.
agent Jareau?
have you ever been shot?
why do you ask?
I just can't stop thinking about how it felt.
did it hurt a lot when Jake died?
you don't need to worry about that.
Jake wasn't shot.
then what was the flash?
what are you...
the unsub we're looking for is a dangerous voyeur who feeds off the thrill of knowing his victims can't see him.
typically voyeurs are nonviolent and content to remain bystanders.
this one is different. He's on a mission that includes taking action.
and in that mission he didn't hesitate to kill a teenage boy.
anyone who stands between him and his goal is at risk.
we believe he's documenting his work.
he's taking pictures and collects personal connections to his victims...
their wallets and their hair.
it's important to him to have proof of what he's doing.
voyeurs like to create fantasies in their heads of what the objects of their obsession should be like.
he creates a character identity instead of a reality.
and when a person steps outside of the parameters that the unsub has set for them, he strikes.
this unsub appears to be triggered by males acting on what he perceives to be character flaws.
seemingly innocuous infractions to us are magnified in the unsub's psychosis.
based on the planning and sophistication of the kills, we believe that he's in his late 30s or 40s.
the geographic profile tells us this unsub is not only dumping his victims downtown, he's hunting there, too.
so this is where we need to redouble our efforts.
go building to building, door to door.
this guy's a fly on the wall.
he's able to learn secrets without anyone realizing he's there.
he'll have a job that involves very little social interaction, but it puts him in a position where he can observe others unnoticed.
so we should look at service workers, groundskeepers, anyone paid to be invisible.
and we need to move quickly.
this unsub is approaching some sort of perceived deadline.
the closer it gets, the more erratic and dangerous he'll become.
thank you.
Hello?
can I help you, Ms. Fouladi?
Hey, Nick. I was wondering if I could take a look at your guest log.
a friend of mine came over the other night and I lost his contact information.
I was hoping you might have it.
Oh, well, let's take a look.
what was his name?
I'm not seeing it.
you sure that's his name?
Yes.
Oh, you know what?
this is only going back to yesterday.
looks like the old sheets have been filed.
and where would those be? - In a box up in our storage attic.
Tanner, our night guy, usually handles all of our paperwork.
I'm pretty sure he can grab those for you once he finishes his rounds.
is there any chance I could take a look right now?
please? It's important.
I'm running kind of late, but, um...
tell you what.
give this to Tanner when you're done.
deal. Thanks.
have a good night. - You, too.
talk to me, baby girl.
you better get ready to get down on one knee, 'cause this B. G. boo just earned herself one hell of a diamond.
What'd you find?
Scott Delfino's phone is a Hotch mess...hot mess...you know what I mean.
data scrambled like a Denver omelet on a Sunday morning.
I can feel those smoldering get-to-the-point stares from here.
so I will.
if the name Ashley is on Scott's phone, I can't find it.
Penelope, this is sounding more like cubic zirconia.
bite your pretty tongue. I didn't stop at the first rejection.
I did what you guys did. I profiled the guy.
Scotty is a ladies' man.
gets a lot of names and numbers, gotta keep track of them all.
what's a player to do, playa?
he gave her a nickname.
baby girl's already taken.
but Bunny wasn't.
tell me you got a number. - Of course I did.
now so do you. Sending it now.
box.
which box?
Hello?
I really wish you hadn't seen that.
no. No.
help! Someone!
wait!
please! Please, no! Let me go!
please!
he killed a woman this time.
and she's also the first one he covered up.
this is remorse. She wasn't part of the plan.
which explains why he moved the body.
she wasn't killed here.
and the garrote was used postmortem.
C. O.D. appears to be blunt force trauma to the back of the head.
he didn't do a good job of covering this up.
he's panicking.
we find where she was killed, we find him.
except no one even knows what her name is.
no I. D.. Just a phone.
one unheard message.
Hi, my name is Derek Morgan with the FBI.
I'm trying to locate a woman, first name Ashley.
it's extremely important.
this is Ashley.
her name is Ashley Fouladi. She's a grad student at B. C. Bills including rent and phone, are in her father's name. That's why we couldn't find her.
you got an address, Garcia? - Yeah. 2410 Boylston Street.
boylston Street.
that's where Colin Kirkland lives, the boy who witnessed the attack on Jake Preston.
right, they're neighbors. Same building, different floor.
Ashley wasn't planned, but Scotty, the guy she was with, was.
right. And it wasn't Ashley's neighbor Colin who's targeted, it was Jake, the boy he was with.
this unsub isn't stalking the people he kills, he's stalking the people that live in that building.
all of hs victims must have interacted with someone residing there.
so, how does he choose who he kills?
all right, well, let's look at it. Ashley comes home with a womanizer who the unsub then killed.
Colin was playing with a video game he wasn't supposed to have.
the unsub killed the boy who gave it to him.
he's targeting bad influences.
he sees himself as a protector.
or as a parent.
he's keeping the people under his own roof safe.
which mean he most likely suffered a past loss.
one he blames himself for.
agents. What can I do for you?
one of your residents, Ashley Fouladi, was killed tonight.
we just want to ask you a few questions.
that's horrible.
did you happen to notice anything strange this evening?
no. But I just got here.
our night guy had a family emergency, so I just got called back in.
did you interact with her earlier today?
was she with anyone?
no one was with her, but she did ask me about our visitor logs.
she was trying to find some guy's number and I just sent her up to our storage room.
can you show us?
Yeah, yeah, of course. Right this way.
it's clear.
somebody's been living up here.
looks like he's making some sort of collage or scrapbook or something.
this guy's got a view of the entire courtyard and a half a dozen apartments.
he can see who's coming and going all day long.
look at this. It's a live feed.
so who else is he watching?
that's Tanner.
the guy I'm covering for.
his name is Tanner Johnson and life has not been kind.
he lost a child, didn't he?
Yeah. Last year. A 10-year-old son Jeremy.
according to reports, Jeremy was playing with a friend, they were like fake wrestling, when Tanner, a free-lance photographer / nighttime door got a call, left the room to take it.
when he returned, his son was unconscious.
the friend was trying to revive him from a chokehold gone horribly wrong.
his son was strangled. That's why he uses a garrote.
Jeremy was on life support for a few days, but he died.
Tanner blames himself.
he stopped watching for a minute and he lost his son.
he hasn't stopped watching since.
the grief must have consumed him.
that's a hell a stressor, but what triggered the murders?
Garcia, what happened to Tanner's wife? Did the marriage survive?
no.
she kicked him out two months ago, right before the killing started.
so he loses his child and then his wife and home.
it's enough to make anyone unstable.
add guilt to that and it's all too much.
he dissociated.
paternal transference.
he claimed the residents of his apartment building as his family.
but we're missing something. Why is he documenting all of this?
we profiled he's running out of time.
the book must have something to do with that.
Oh, snap.
what is it, Garcia?
Hannah, Tanner's wife, she's pregnant.
that's who he's watching online.
Garcia, when is the baby due?
the baby's due...
yesterday.
Matt? I think it's time.
your nephew's getting antsy.
don't worry. I'm home.
and when the baby comes, we're gonna be a family again.
he's not picking up.
he's not going to. He's got what he wants.
I am checking Hannah's social media footprint now.
it looks like her brother Matt is staying with her until the baby's born.
I'm sending you his number.
don't bother, Garcia. I see him.
where?
Oh, God. God.
you killed him?
Why?
don't worry about him.
sit down!
he's not gonna hurt Hannah or the baby, will he?
not while she's pregnant. He has to keep the child safe.
and after?
look at me. Look at me.
we're gonna be a family again.
no, we can't be a family.
it didn't work.
but it will this time. It will, 'cause I've changed!
I've noticed.
I did everything you said.
and I'm stronger now.
I...I can keep our family safe.
if you want to protect us, I need you to get me to a hospital.
please. Please.
no, no.
I can't take you to the hospital. Something could happen to the baby.
Oh, God!
that's exactly why have to get me to a hospital.
no. No.
something could go wrong.
Oh, God. And it won't here?
here...
here...
I can help you.
you can't help me!
you're too weak!
you've always been weak.
weak.
you won't say that after you've seen this.
look. See?
look.
Tanner thinks his book proves he can take care of the baby.
and if she rejects that, he could unravel even more.
Uh-huh, and what happens then?
no one will be safe, not even the child.
look, look.
this is Colin.
Colin, see, he's a good boy, really.
till he met this kid, Jake.
but I took care of him.
and this man, Scott.
OK? I'd seen him at the building before.
you see, Ashley-- Ashley thought she was the first girl he seduced there, but she wasn't.
I made sure she was the last.
what is this?
this is proof.
this is proof that I can protect our new baby.
this is proof.
proof that I'm never, never gonna let anything or anyone ever hurt him.
You're...Insane.
no.
put it down.
you can't be in here.
Tanner, think about what you're doing.
you don't want to hurt your baby, do you? That's what happened to Jeremy.
go away! Just get out of here!
Hannah, how far apart are you contractions?
they're constant!
the baby's coming now.
look, man, your baby is about to be born.
now, we want to help you, but you need to put that weapon down.
No! This is my child. I'm not leaving it.
Hannah, I need you to breathe deeply. Breathe deeply.
Oh, my God.
Hannah, I need you to start pushing...
we need medics to Hannah Johnson's residence right away.
they're already on the way.
I can't.
Yes, you can, baby, just like with Jeremy.
1, 2,3... - This is not helping.
Tanner, you need to let her go.
the stress isn't good for the baby.
if Hannah doesn't start pushing now we could lose the child.
I have to watch him.
I have to keep him safe.
like you did with Ashley?
that was an accident. I didn't mean to.
I know you didn't. Accidents happen.
what happened with Jeremy was an accident, right?
if I'd have been there I could have helped him.
guys, something's wrong.
the umbilical cord's wrapped around the baby's throat.
no. - What?
well, Reid, do something.
I need something to cut the cord with, quickly!
use these.
No! No!
don't worry, Hannah, your baby's doing fine, but you need to keep pushing.
ready? - Medics on the way.
we can't risk moving her now. We'll have to deliver the baby here.
Oh, God!
squeeze her hand as hard as you can and push.
Oh, I can't.
I can't. - Yes, you can. You're doing great.
I need to see this.
you're doing great. I can see the head. Keep pushing. Keep pushing.
you've seen enough. - No!
keep pushing, all right?
keep pushing.
Oh, God!
the most important thing that parents can teach their children is how to get along without them.
and to Dr. Spencer Reid, who may be adding M. D. to an already impressive list of credentials.
and to Spencer Johnson, may he prove to be the child prodigy like his namesake.
how on earth did you know what to do?
when JJ was pregnant with Henry,
I memorized the delivery manuals just in case she went into labor in the field.
I have to admit the practical application did not quite live up to the theory.
Thanks. This night is not about me, though. To Dave Rossi.
Oh, I still can't believe you guys did this.
we wanted to make sure you had one last proper goodbye.
and I may or may not have posted on the Quantico message boards that all the drinks are on you tonight.
and they are indeed, thank you very much.
um, but that's not all.
I don't believe that, uh, any of the members of this team have heard you sing.
next up is David Rossi.
that was intentional. - Next up is David Rossi.
Dave, get your ass up here and sing us out already.
and, look, it's in your key.
to all the great memories that have happened within these walls, if you think I'm doing this without backup, you're nuts.
come on, JJ, Reid, let's go.
Derek! Come on.
everybody sing!
it's time for the contest that's taking America by storm, "stop that deejay.
fine. Bring it on, chump.
so we got through the holidays in one piece, right?
but the big bearded guy in the red suit deserves one last trivia shout-out.
now, we know he didn't deliver all these presents by himself.
so, name for me all of Santa's 9 reindeer.
Oh, I know this. Prancer, Dancer
forgive me, sweetheart. I tried to make it right.
Hey, Dave, take a look at this, would you?
this arrived at my house last night.
it's a gift from Harrison Scott.
your buddy from Vietnam.
appreciate everything you've done for me.
the grips are a replica of the Vietnam War Memorial.
it's beautiful. It's expensive.
what's the matter?
a gift like this would practically drain all of Harrison's savings.
now, if you're trying to get yourself back on your feet, why would you do something like that?
you talk to him? I left 3 messages where he lives at New Directions for Veterans.
he hasn't returned my calls. That's only been since last night.
I phoned his job this morning. He hasn't shown up for work the past two days, either.
I'm worried, Aaron.
why don't you go out to Los Angeles and check on him. What about our caseload?
it'll be fine. You've got leave coming.
you should go.
maybe I'll do that. Thank you.
sure.
it's staged. They got people on those programs they know are gonna fight.
you should've seen that guy's wife when he brought his two girlfriends out on the stage.
hoo hoo hoo. Punches flying everywhere.
it's a TV show. It's fake.
whoa. Your ass just got checkmated, homes.
it's checkers, not chess. King me.
well, here's the problem, your majesty.
this right here where you're playing-- this is our office.
you want to come here, play a little game, you gotta pay us rent.
I said king me. I ain't kidding, old-timer.
cough it up, wallet and watch, both of you.
I faced a lot worse than you in Korea.
you two-bit punks don't scare me. Oh, yeah?
well, I can get a whole lot scarier than this, grandpa.
what's going on? We've got a possible spree killer in Cleveland.
details are sketchy, but 90 minutes ago a man shot and killed two gang members at a park on the outskirts of the city.
why are we thinking spree? I mean, gang members shoot each other all the time.
because a third gang member fled the scene, the shooter hunted him down at a gas station over a mile away to finish the job.
not your typical M. O. for a gang shooting. Oh, and there's more.
after the third gang member was killed, a fourth person was shot and killed at a bus stop less than a half a mile away from the gas station.
also gang related?
I don't know. Details still coming in.
4 homicides, 3 locations, all within 90 minutes.
we need to hurry. Wheels up in 15.
I'll let Morgan know.
can I help you with something, sir?
how much ammunition can I buy? Well, depends how much you need.
those.
that's 19. 95.
I'm gonna need a lot more than that.
beware the fury of a patient man.
John Dryden.
you know, the description of our unsub is pretty vague.
40s, 50s, rumpled clothing like they could have been slept in.
and two witnesses in the park said he appeared to have been drinking.
they could smell alcohol on him.
the first 3 victims all had police records-- car theft, aggravated assault, and drug dealing.
if they involve drugs, the unsub might be a disgruntled customer.
sorry. Babysitting issues at home.
Garcia, did we get confirmation that the fourth victim at the bus stop was not gang affiliated?
that is correct, sir. Paul Haller, high school senior. Not an angel, though.
haller has a few minor robbery arrests from the past, and police found a wallet on his body, cash and credit cards belonging to a Sita Patel.
Purse-snatching? Gang members, mugger.
we might be looking at a vigilante. All right, I just got off the phone with Cleveland P. D.
if we are dealing with a spree killer, at least he's on a slower boil now.
no new incidents reported in the past hour. The victim at the gas station wasn't just shot.
the body showed signs of having been run over multiple times by a large vehicle.
that is one way to put the "over" in overkill.
Morgan, you and JJ go to the park where the first shooting took place.
Blake, go to the gas station crime scene, and as soon as we can find Sita Patel,
Reid and I will talk to her, see if she interacted with the unsub.
Cleveland, OH
I was walking to work. The boy grabbed my handbag, and then when I tried to hold on, he yanked hard, and I fell.
did anyone else see the attack.
many people. But they did nothing.
nobody stayed to help? Only one, a man.
did he say anything to you? He asked me which direction the boy went.
I told him and he left. Did the man leave on foot or in a vehicle?
I didn't see.
he was very calm. Calm and determined.
Uh-huh. All right, thanks for your help.
will you have your driver call me if he remembers anything else?
appreciate that.
well, not exactly an outpouring of grief from the locals.
victims were bad news. Take a look at this.
the street sweeper had to go around whatever was parked here.
I just got off the phone with the street-sweeping team.
they said their truck passed by approximately 15 minutes before the 911 call came in about the shooting.
that means the car was obviously parked there then, but gone before the police responded.
do we have a vehicle description? They said it was a two-tone brown and beige SUV.
out of state plates, and no license number.
street-sweeping team said the car was packed full of boxes and clothes.
the unsub was described as looking disheveled.
all right, so was the person in the car a witness to the killings or was he the killer himself?
:LOS ANGELES, CA
so, Harrison didn't give you any indication where he might have gone?
no. We asked his roommates, checked the local jails and hospitals. Nothing.
did you or anybody else notice a change in him recently?
Mr. Scott did seem a little different, now that you mention it.
in what way? Angry? Depressed?
no. We see a lot of that here and know how to deal with it.
no, with Mr. Scott it was...
I don't know. He'd stare right through you, like his mind was a million miles away.
were any of his clothes or personal belongings missing?
it's hard to say. Our participants have so few possessions to begin with.
ms. Grant, give me a chance to find him, to try to convince him to come back.
we have a very long waiting list, so, unfortunately, our policy about unauthorized absences is very strict.
after 3 days, the participant loses their spot.
Mr. Scott's been gone two days already, so that leaves you less than 24 hours.
I
thank you.
OK, honey. All right, bye-bye.
Terry? What are you doing here?
Terry, you're not supposed to be here. You know that.
Terry--Terry, please. Terry, no, don't.
don't! Don't! Don't do this!
Terry, stop!
Terry, no! Stop, Terry! Stop!
a restraining order?
I'll call the cops on you. I swear it! Aah!
this was sent to me at my job. In front of my clients, in front of my
that's 'cause you never opened the door to the process server! You shut up!
No!
what do you think about that restraining order now?
who the hell are you? Get your hand off her neck.
just go back to your cardboard box. This doesn't concern you.
I said beat it.
sir-- Ohh!
anything from Sita Patel?
the man who asked which way the purse-snatcher went matches the description of the unsub.
how did it go at the gas station?
maybe it's just me, but if I saw a person gunned down and run over by a car a half a dozen times, I'd remember it.
let me guess--witnesses are drawing a blank. "It all happened so fast.
no surveillance cameras at the gas station either.
it's a high-crime area and the victims were criminals.
the neighborhood could be looking at this as a problem solved. There's been another shooting.
my ex grabbed my throat, and the next thing I know, this guy was in the yard and he shot Terry and he took off.
can you describe the other guy?
no. Everything happened so fast.
coins were found scattered all around the area, like somebody emptied out their pockets? I didn't notice.
so when we analyze the coins, we won't find trace evidence of you or your ex on them-- no fingerprints
OK. Yeah, I think Terry may have thrown some coins at the guy.
well, when we get back to the station, you can help the police artist render a likeness?
no. Excuse me?
you have no idea what it's been like.
the past two years I wake up every morning scared to death.
Terry was crazy violent and nobody would do a single thing about it.
he was issued a restraining order.
Oh, yeah. You saw how restrained he was.
you want to see what he did once?
I was cooking dinner, he got mad and threw scalding oil at me.
did you press charges? Terry told everyone it was an accident.
that I dropped a frying pan. But the police would have investigated, Madison.
Terry's Mr. Charity fund-raiser, all-around good guy at the country club.
it was my word against his. Please, give me a break.
but it's over now, thanks to that guy.
I hope you don't find him.
whoever it was, I hope he gets away.
what the hell are you doing here? We need to talk.
I got nothin' to say. Now get the hell out of here.
what are you gonna do, Harrison punch me?
hit me over the head with that lamp? What happened?
you came a long way for nothing. That's what happened.
it's been a long time since I've been in here.
what, 35 years, maybe more?
there used to be a pinball machine over there.
I see you're traveling light.
packed what I needed. Don't see anything else.
like said, packed what I needed.
do I need to search this room for a weapon?
I did not come here to blow my brains out, Dave.
how the hell did you know that I'd be here?
educated guess. No money, no car.
I figured you'd find someplace cheap and familiar.
as you know, we were stationed at Pendleton.
we spent a lot of time here before we shipped out.
so, when I called and found out that your old pal Pete still owned this place
the way you sniff people out,
I should've recommended you to Recon Division back in 'Nam.
the seal on that is not broken.
you can check. I haven't had a drop in 14 months.
but you brought it along just in case.
a person doesn't need to pull the trigger of a gun to kill himself.
why, Harrison? You were doing so well.
I got no answer for that.
I come to the end of my road, Dave.
I'm just sorry you had to come so far to see it.
there's somebody at the door. Go check.
Yeah, who is it? You know who it is.
what's going on? I don't know. It looks like some older dude.
what's the problem, man? We're busy in there.
you know who I am.
hell, no . am I supposed to?
I know who you are.
good for you. Now mosey your ass back out of here.
I've been waiting a long time for this.
victims were small-time meth dealers, been in and out of jail for years.
what do you got? Garcia patched in surveillance video from the hallway camera.
it's our unsub.
he walks straight to the meth dealers' apartment, and that's consistent with his M. O. of targeting criminals.
but he stumbled on the first victims by chance.
he sought these out. He's evolving.
Garcia's trying to pull surveillance video from the surrounding area.
we're looking for a two-tone SUV with out of state plates.
he looks straight into the camera.
he doesn't care who sees him.
you should eat. Nah, not hungry.
well, I'll save you some kung pao beef.
the early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.
no.
want to hear yours? It's pretty good.
those hills there.
what about 'em?
my son Thomas and his wife live on the other side of those hills.
in Carlsbad. The son you haven't spoken to in a while?
19 years.
I called him out the blue the other day.
What'd he say? Hello.
goodbye.
don't call again. That was the gist of it.
I got a grandson
I didn't even know about, Dave.
I could hear him talking in the background.
grandson on the other side of the hill.
I ain't never gonna see him.
well... Let's go, then.
no point. Permission to state the obvious, sir.
permission denied.
you spent the last of your money to come down here.
that's not someone who's throwing in the towel.
that's someone who wants another chance.
I don't know, Cruz. We could be here another day or two.
why don't you send me a secure contact number and I'll get back-- um...
OK, yeah. Well, you tell him mommy misses him.
talk to you soon. What have you got, Garcia?
as your gigantic brain suspected, sir, a two-tone SUV with Florida plates was parked across the street from the apartment building.
were you able to pull a plate? The SUV is registered to a Clifford Walsh.
do you have an address? Nothing local.
Walsh moved out of the area a long time ago.
and if you hate sad stories as much as I do, you should leave the room right now, 'cause this one's super sad.
10 years ago Walsh lost his wife and his 14-year-old son in a home invasion robbery.
Hzere in Cleveland?
Yeah. Uh, it looks like the motive was stealing stuff.
jewelry has taken out of the home, and there was an attempted sexual assault on Mrs. Walsh.
where was Walsh at the time of the home invasion?
he was working as a night supervisor of a tool and die plant in Strongville, which is just outside the city.
did they get the killer? Yeah, very next day.
Howard Clark, 18 years old.
high as a kite on meth at the time of the attack.
he was only sentenced to 10 years in prison. The meth angle is interesting.
did Clark have any connection with the victims in the apartment?
Yeah. He was buddies with Dane Hendrix, one of the victims.
10 years. That's awfully lenient for a double homicide.
you think? Maybe that's why Walsh went into a total tailspin.
he started drinking, quit his job, moved to Florida.
he's been like borderline homeless for many, many years.
when did he come back to Cleveland?
last week. He cashed out his meager savings account and headed north.
here is what's interesting about the timing of this, though.
Howard Clark, the guy who killed Walsh's wife and son, he was scheduled to be released 3 months from now, but he was killed in a random prison fight in the exercise yard the day before Walsh left Florida.
that must have been the trigger-- Clark's death-- that stirred up all memories.
and the memories brought him back to Cleveland.
but for what purpose?
the man we're looking for is Clifford Walsh.
the photograph you have of him was taken last year. Walsh's family died in a home invasion robbery 10 years ago.
the killer was a man named Howard Clark.
but Clark's recent death in prison may have triggered Walsh's spree.
the first 5 murders appear to be opportunistic kills, but all the victims have criminal records or a history of domestic violence.
the shooting at the meth apartment, however, was premeditated and calculated.
one of the victims was Dane Hendrix, a friend of Howard Clark's at the time of the invasion.
targeting Hendrix means Walsh might now be trending towards more mission-oriented behavior.
Walsh has no concerns about keeping his identity or movements secret.
in some ways his recklessness works in our favor.
he's out in the open. Here I am. Come and get me.
but this is a man who's lost his family and feels he has nothing to lose.
he doesn't care about repercussions, which makes him the most dangerous kind of spree killer.
time is of the essence. Thank you.
agent Hotchner. We found Walsh's vehicle.
forgive me, sweetheart. I tried to make it right.
suicide note?
Walsh may have been about to kill himself and saw the thugs hassling the old man.
but he killed them instead. Well that makes sense.
the line between suicidal and homicidal ideation is pretty thin.
look at this. Is he counting something down?
the number sequence starts at 3, 553 and ends...
let's see, Clark was killed on January 14th...
87 days before his scheduled release date of April 11th.
working backwards and taking into account the 2009, 2012 leap years, 3, 553 days...
april 9, 2004, the exact day Clark began his prison term.
so Walsh was waiting for Clark to be released to take revenge on him.
and suddenly the object of his vengeance was gone.
but Walsh's need for justice wasn't. His revenge has simply found another outlet.
we need to see if any cars have been reported stolen in the area in the last couple hours.
if Walsh is swapping out vehicles, it would be the first indication he's cared enough to take evasive action.
something else must be on the menu.
something important enough that he can't risk being caught.
we need to figure out who's next on Walsh's list of targets.
you know, Walsh lost his wife and his child. He could be looking to balance the books.
Clark did get a light sentence. Walsh might have a grudge against the judge or surviving jury members.
we need to get those names, as well as the defense attorney and anyone who testified on Clark's behalf.
the newspaper reports at the time suggested Clark might have had an accomplice.
it was just a rumor, but it was a persistent one. Maybe it was Dane Hendrix, the meth dealer?
no, he had a solid alibi for the night of the home invasion. Clark always said he acted alone, but still...
we need to locate and get all of these people into protective custody.
this ain't gonna work, Dave.
wait here.
can I help you? Thomas Scott?
Yes. My name is David Rossi.
I'm a friend of your father's.
did he send you? No.
all I'm asking is a few minutes of your time.
may I come in?
don't take this wrong, but we've got nothing to talk about.
please.
wantede Nothing in Walsh's background hinted at this type of psychotic break.
testimonials all reported him as a solid, loving family man.
he supported his wife while she went through a brief bout of depression.
when his son had problems at school, he took him to one of those expanded horizon treks.
you know, the second intruder theory has some validity. How so?
because Walsh's wife was athletic and his son played junior varsity football.
meaning it might have been hard for Clark to subdue them both.
especially if his faculties were diminished by drugs at the time.
and mother and son were found at opposite sides of the house.
you're right, Hotch. Someone might have been helping Clark.
Mr. Hines?
Yes. Can I help you with something?
you know who I am.
no. Sorry.
I know who you are.
look, I think you got the wrong place
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Jeffrey? What's happening?
the victim is Jeffrey Hines. He wasn't on our target list.
does he have a connection to Walsh or Clark? Well, Garcia can't find one.
hines and his wife moved to Cleveland from Hawaii last month.
what does his wife say?
Walsh came to the door, said something to her husband, and then he just opened fire.
something's off on this one.
maybe Hines has a past she doesn't know about.
well, hopefully that's it. Why hopefully?
because if there's truly no connection here, Walsh is devolving.
he's killing random people.
I know he put his life on the line for his country.
I admire and I respect him for that. Unsung heroes.
a lot of good men come back from combat damaged.
they deserve another chance. Another chance.
Mr. Rossi, when I was 12 years old, my father told me he was never going to drink again.
for the umpteenth time.
and I believed him. I was a kid.
then one day he takes me and 3 of my friends to Dodger stadium.
I can still remember the exact moment the vendor put that first beer in his hand.
second inning, Mickey Hatcher at the plate.
one ball, two strikes.
I saw that beer and I knew what was coming.
my father got so drunk, my friends' parents had to come pick us up and take us home.
take me home.
I'm really sorry, Thomas.
I could tell you 10 more stories just like that one.
this program my father's in, hopefully it makes him better, but my son is not going through the same humiliation and disappointment that I did.
I don't hate my father, Mr. Rossi.
I don't not care about him. I love him.
but I've got to protect my family.
that's my priority.
all I ask is that you don't take the possibility of forgiveness off the table.
not yet.
can I get you some more tea, Mr. Rossi? No, thank you, ma'am.
I--I really should be going.
he's outside, isn't he?
he's in the car.
I wish it were possible, Mr. Rossi, but it isn't.
I've worked too hard to build a good home for me and my family.
people can't build without tools.
and tools are passed down to us from others.
when you take in the life you've built, Thomas, and watch the life your son will build for his own family...
remember that.
I knew I was crazy to hope.
I'm sorry, Harrison. So I guess that's it, then.
your son's a fine young man. You should be proud.
I am.
I just wish I could tell him that to his face.
what now? You tell me.
I could take you back to the motel and leave you with your vodka.
or, if I ignore every speed limit sign between here and Santa Monica,
I could get you back to New Directions just under the wire.
look, Harrison, it took a long time to get to this point with your son.
it's not gonna fix itself overnight.
????
and now???
and on the international front, 60 people, mostly women and children, are believed dead in a suicide bombing. Authorities
enough of that depressing stuff. It's happy hour, for crying out loud.
things won't change. Excuse me?
the world. There aren't enough bullets to make things right.
you got that thing figured out with your neighbor yet? Ah, jeez, the doggie-doo wars.
I told you, that kid will never pick up after his mutt when he goes on my lawn, right?
Yeah. But yesterday, it really hits me.
I'm going about this all wrong. It's not the kid's fault, it's the parents' fault.
they never taught him any better. Did you go talk to them?
I did better than that. Last night, I scooped up the dog poop, walked next door, I set it right down on mom and dad's welcome mat.
mi caca es su caca. That's great.
take the problem to the doorstep. Go to the source.
this is strange. The M. E. reports from the home invasion.
Teddy Walsh's wrists were tightly bound, but there were no subdermal hematomas around the deep ligature marks.
what do you see here?
someone clinging to memories. It's basically a shrine to his wife.
more importantly, what don't you see here?
his son. Exactly.
there's not a single photograph or shred of memorabilia about him.
and the suicide note was addressed only to his wife.
Garcia, you said Teddy Walsh had gotten into some trouble at school, yes?
Yeah. Nothing serious.
he stole a video game from another kid's locker.
and that's why Walsh took his son on the Expanded Horizons hike? Uh-huh, that's right.
and Expanded Horizons takes people out in groups, yes? Yes, sir.
OK, can you find out the names of the other participants on that specific trek?
let me see...
Oh. Lordy, lordy.
Howard Clark and father.
Walsh and Clark were on that hike together.
I think we just found Clark's accomplice.
Walsh's own son.
we haven't found the connection with the jogger yet, but every victim of Walsh's has been associated with criminal behavior.
only the guilty deserve to die. Except today started with Walsh ready to die himself.
he wrote a suicide note. Because he was guilty, too.
his own son was complicit in the death of his wife.
Garcia. Talk to me.
are Howard Clark's parents still in the Cleveland area? Uh, father died 5 years ago, heart attack.
Mother--yep, Helen Clark. Sending her address now.
you said earlier that Walsh might want to balance the books.
there'd only be one person to provide that kind of payback. Another parent.
Mrs. Clark. You know who I am, don't you?
Yes.
then you know why I'm here.
am I going to die tonight?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm afraid you are.
Howard Clark's mother won't answer. The two boys probably hatched the plan when they met on the hiking trip.
Teddy knew where his mother kept the jewels and when his father would be gone.
except Clark shows up high on meth, tries to rape the mother, Teddy fights back and Clark kills the both of them.
and that explains the lack of subdermal hematomas on Teddy's wrists.
he was killed first and then tied up.
jeffrey Hines, the jogger who got shot, Garcia found a connection.
it's not who he was, it's where he was.
your son doesn't look like much of a killer there.
neither did my son, though.
what are you talking about?
my son Teddy was in on it.
not the killing part. But he made it happen.
I got a picture, too.
this is my wife, Emma.
look at it.
I'm so sorry.
if I'd been a better dad, and you'd been a better mom...
it's too late for what-ifs.
we can't blame ourselves for what happened that night.
no?
I watched you in the courtroom when you testified for your son, defending the murder of my family?
I'm a mother. No matter what happens in this world, a child has a right to know there is somebody who will stand up for them.
even if they're a cold-blooded killer?
the drugs had taken over my boy.
I know my son.
and what happened that evening, that wasn't who he was.
I thought I knew my son, too.
Emma tried to warn me that he needed help.
small things...
I didn't listen.
Mrs. Clark, do you think we're reunited with loved ones after death?
Yes, I do.
I wish I did.
I think...
it's just a way for the living to cope with loss.
I guess we'll both find out soon enough, won't we?
are you scared?
I think about fear a lot.
I try to imagine what Emma must have felt In those final moments.
Clifford Walsh, FBI. Put the weapon on the table.
no. Slowly lower it.
Helen hasn't harmed anyone. She's innocent.
wrong. I don't hurt the innocent.
wrong. You already have.
who? The thugs in the park?
the meth dealers? The guy that was choking his wife?
you're forgetting about the jogger. Hines?
let me tell you about him.
when Hines went to the D. A.'s office,
Clark's father used his influence to have evidence suppressed.
evidence...
that would have sent my wife's killer to jail for life.
the former employee at the D. A.'s office was Morgan Hines.
6 months ago he sold that house to his brother Jeffrey.
that was the man you killed. No.
that was the place. I checked.
jeffrey Hines was innocent, Clifford, and you murdered him.
he left behind a wife and 3 kids.
when I saw the sun come up this morning,
I knew it was gonna be my last time.
Mrs. Clark...
I hope you're right.
how was your night? All squared away.
and I talked to my boss at work.
he's gonna let me keep my job. Great.
I sound like a broken record, but...
thanks again for everything. Stretchin' out...
just focus on controlling what you can.
the rest of it will fall into place. Right.
one more thing.
that fortune cookie of mine back at the motel, what did it say?
Oh, yeah.
um, "Be careful to avoid extravagant purchases this month.
well, I think I can manage that one.
well, then I'll count the pistol you gave me as being part of last month.
I'll check in with you when I'm back in Washington.
forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future.
paul Boese.
you have any plans tonight? Uh, does sleep count as a plan?
I'm going to a Korean film festival in Georgetown. You can come with me if you want.
sounds fun. I'm really tired.
to BE CONTINUED...
like, we really, we really shouldn't meet like this.
I know.
but, uh, we gotta talk about some things.
Hotch: Everyone, this is our new section chief.
this is agent Mateo Cruz.
you could have mentioned this.
I got word minutes after we had breakfast.
Cruz has risen through the ranks.
you ever heard of this Cruz guy?
Yeah, I've heard his name.
every time your name was mentioned today and every time I didn't say, hey, yeah, I know him, I'm lying.
that case could stay open for a couple of years.
it's already been almost 3.
can't we just say we're on assignment?
no one can know.
chief Strauss.
agent Jareau.
welcome.
I've been ordered to brief you on your new assignment.
you'll be splitting time between here and D.C.
so I haven't been drafted?
your transfer to State was a necessary backstop.
this mission is code word classified.
even the personnel reporting to you will not know the nature of your work.
you need to change.
you just lost us a valuable asset.
me? That terrorist got hurt trying to escape.
you were right.
he talked?
Yeah, well, he started to, and then this.
agent Jareau, this is Mateo Cruz.
he's heading up the taskforce.
all right, follow me.
Hastings, do you have a minute?
was this man tortured to death?
this man is al-Qaeda operative Savin Mubari.
he was one of Bin Laden's couriers, and, yes, he was.
didn't anyone tell you to get changed?
Hastings, why don't you say hello to SSA Jennifer Jareau from the BAU.
she'll be handling female interrogations.
we don't need a profile if we know we're looking for bin Laden.
I'm not a profiler.
I was the communications liaison.
hell, then why is she even here?
stand down. Jareau is a proven mediator.
don't get comfortable. This places changes people.
I can't imagine what it'll do to someone like you.
arrogance aside, Hastings is CIA elite, so... how can you say that?
he just tortured a man to death.
the Bureau and the CIA handle things differently, but...
Hastings didn't do this.
who's the woman?
that's Nadia,
Mubari's wife.
does she know anything?
it's up to you to find out.
agent Jareau, this is Tivon Askari, our interpreter.
you'll be working closely with him on this assignment.
very nice to meet you.
JJ's cell still hasn't shown up.
I'm telling you, Hotch, she's in trouble.
Garcia's tracking her car now.
agent Sharp, will you take agent Jareau's son to my office?
it's an emergency.
thank you. Yes, sir.
you go with her, love.
I found it. It's on the south side of the street.
they're here.
Uh...ok.
Yeah.
I'll let you know.
JJ's car's parked on Constitution.
morgan and Reid are on their way.
find Matt Cruz. He'll know what's going on.
Mm-hmm. Section Chief Matt Cruz?
grant, it's Garcia. I need to speak to Matt Cruz.
that's why I couldn't tell you on the phone. JJ made me promise.
Yeah, I know what time it is. Get him now.
well, she was afraid someone was listening, but what does Cruz have to do with JJ's disappearance?
they worked together at the State department.
neither one has mentioned that.
they couldn't. Their assignment was classified.
no, past tense. JJ worked at the State department years ago.
well, I thought that, too, until Cruz was assigned here and the secret calls and texts started again.
look, all I know is, is JJ said if anything every happened to her that Cruz would know what to do.
sir, there's a problem.
chief Cruz isn't answering and GPS on his mobile isn't transmitting.
that's the same thing as JJ.
Garcia, have Rossi and Blake check out Cruz's house, and, Anderson, put agent Jareau's family in protective custody.
this is SSA Hotchner with the BAU. I need to speak to the Director.
they're trying to access Integrity!
we can't let them get our codes!
you have forgotten.
I know exactly how to get what I want.
because there is nowhere else to look.
Hotch is on his way to the State department to get some answers.
we found JJ's cell phone, but there wasn't any sign of her.
Cruz is missing, too.
his car is still in his garage, but mail and newspapers suggest that he's been gone at least 24 hours.
I'm trying -- I'm trying to pull data off of JJ's phone, but it's like level 9 security.
it would make Snowden weep.
what about cell phone records?
encrypted. JJ's and Cruz's.
that's not surprising if they work for the State department.
but if that assignment was a backstop, then JJ's transfer as D. O. D. liaison was her cover.
so what was she really doing that year?
that's the first question Hotch is gonna ask.
Strauss was pressured by the Executive branch to push JJ's transfer through in 2010, so she would have known the reason why.
any assignment Strauss authorized would be archived in the SCIF.
that facility is code word classified.
OK, but Anderson can get you in.
Morgan: He archives those reports.
she probably has it foxholed right here in the BAU.
we just need to find it.
and what are you not telling us?
whoever took Cruz and JJ is highly trained and highly organized.
justice, Defense, and State.
it's our job to find the leverage that assures it is.
let's get it done.
Yeah. Yeah.
the sooner you give me the security codes, the sooner this can end.
say yes if you understand.
what the hell is going on?
she just went crazy on me. I don't know where it came from.
Where's the doll? What doll?
the doll. We need to find the doll.
it's ok. Calm down.
where is the doll?
it was on the ground outside.
translate, please.
me?
that was your first step at developing rapport.
we need to build on that.
my name is Jennifer.
this is Michael.
was that your child's?
where is she?
quetta.
she's in Pakistan.
OK, uh, tell her if she gives us the names of the men that dealt with her husband, we'll reunite her with her daughter.
we can't tell her that.
OK, we can, but we can't actually do it.
most of the files are kept on hard copy to prevent digital espionage.
OK. Good thing one of us reads 20, 000 words per minute.
time to get my spy face on.
this has to be JJ's foxhole.
it was her office when she was liaison.
Hotch handles most of the paperwork now, but before JJ was a profiler, she reviewed cases in here.
all right, 4 digits. Any ideas.
Henry's birthday is November 12.
that's too easy.
try 2008, the year she became a mom.
Yep.
what's integrity?
I don't know.
but someone does.
agent Hotchner, we told you we were handling this.
Yes, Madame Secretary.
I thought it would be a good idea if we shared information.
tell us what you know.
well, it might save time if you told me the true nature of agent Jareau's reassignment in 2010.
but you already know that.
I know that that was her backstop.
I'm referring to something called "Integrity."
clear the room, please.
cross-reference keyword "Integrity" against Middle East operations dating back to 2010.
now we're talking.
what did you find?
a ghost file in a ghost folder on a ghost server that nobody wants me to know about.
I'll have to resurrect some gigabytes.
so agent Jareau was on a taskforce to find Bin Laden and Integrity was the name of the operation?
no.
a failsafe put in place to protect covert agents and operations. You shouldn't even know it exists.
but agent Jareau and agent Cruz know, and that's why they've been taken.
we believe so.
both have the necessary codes to access the system.
why was JJ in the Middle East?
and what were Cruz and Strauss doing there?
but she's already given us the names of two high-level terrorists.
to assure her family's safety, she'll be even more willing to cooperate.
we can't risk U. S. casualties trying to save a terrorist's daughter.
well, she was married to one, but Nadia is a mother first.
look, she's clutching that doll as if her life depends on it.
we put her daughter in her arms instead, she'll tell us everything.
agent Jareau has a valid point.
the child's definitely her achilles heel.
what if she's already given us everything?
two terrorists her husband knew, ok.
but neither provided tangible leads to OBL.
she could be stalling.
and what if she's not?
what if she has one more name that gets us Bin Laden?
well, that's a risk worth taking.
OK, I'll contact secretary Jackson.
all right, our fourth person is Michael Hastings,
CIA operative, killed in action April 24, 2011.
operation classified.
this isn't right.
the U. S. doesn't commemorate clandestine operations.
these are surveillance images.
so who took them?
the same person who killed Hastings.
let's hope Hotch can find out who that was.
so agents Jareau and Cruz get written off?
I know they're your team, but they're not your problem.
who killed agent Hastings?
he was a senior member of the taskforce you assembled.
his name is Tivon Askari, former Iraqi special forces.
a turned interrogator, Askari aided in debriefing informants.
he was our lead translator until an attack on the taskforce exposed him as a traitor.
following the attack, Jareau and Cruz uncovered among his belongings.
where is he now?
Askari went to ground, we've been looking for him ever since.
well, he wouldn't have resurfaced without a reason.
he knows how valuable access to something like Integrity would be to our enemies, and if you have no idea where he is, then agents Cruz and Jareau are running out of time.
what you need to do, agent, is stand down.
we are handling this.
this needs to be managed a little more delicately than by the coarse hands of the BAU.
what that means, no more SCIF break-ins.
no more database searches.
go back to chasing serial killers.
this is a State matter.
Yeah.
they just locked us out.
is State doing anything to find JJ and Cruz?
no.
so what are we gonna do?
we call in reinforcements.
this is Prentiss.
Hotch, what's wrong?
debrief me on the plane. I'm on my way.
soon.
extraction team is on approach.
they should have Nadia's daughter momentarily.
Helo's on the ground.
Roger, team 3, we are picking up activity in sector 9.
extraction's in place. Go, go, go!
we've got a family.
two adults, one child.
can you confirm their identities?
it's the target. We have the girl.
proceed with extraction.
we're taking fire!
take cover.
pull out of there. Pull out of there now!
pull out!
that was an explosion.
all right, get them back on line.
get them back on the line.
team 3...
team 3. This is over watch Alpha. Come in. Over.
team 3, report.
team 3, this is over watch Alpha. Report.
according to Interpol data,
Askari is as bad as they get.
highly educated member of the Republican Guard caught torturing POWs off the clock for fun.
I'm sending you his profile now.
so this is who has JJ?
his name speaks volumes.
Tivon means "student of nature,
yet Askari means soldier.
Askari's methods appear well documented.
he's organized, he's meticulous.
he typically spends 24 hours with his subjects before they break.
reid: They've had Cruz at least that long.
Morgan: It looks like this guy uses most of the standard torture techniques.
Rossi: He even keeps his ritual to an established timeline.
no sexual torture.
maybe he has lines he doesn't cross.
but Askari isn't just a torturer.
he's a sadistic serial killer.
and they love getting off.
savin Mubari and his wife Nadia.
he was a known confidant to bin Laden's.
both were at the camp where JJ worked.
then JJ would have been assigned to interrogate Nadia.
do we know what happened to her?
M. O. matches all of Askari's victims except for one thing.
she was raped.
so what was different about her?
maybe she lasted the longest.
if his ritual dictates a specific timeline, any new aspect would fall later in his routine.
so the longer JJ holds out, the greater the likelihood that'll happen to her.
so how much time does JJ have?
a few hours.
no, no, no, what are you doing?
it's ok.
you son of a bitch!
it's ok.
you have 5 seconds to give me what I want.
you kill him, your plan is ruined!
stop counting! 3...
please! 2...
1... No.
No!
let her down.
you don't have to come.
we know.
this is gonna destroy her.
it isn't your fault.
like hell.
I was the one who said we should go get her daughter.
when war broke out, it looks like Askari's talents
so Askari works for the highest bidder.
wait, I might know that. I uploaded that ghost file to my private cloud server.
the order was given by chief Cruz.
why would Cruz enlist a man like Askari?
he needed a high-ranking partner to put him in position.
so what are we saying, Cruz and Askari were working together?
then JJ's in more danger than we thought.
Hey. Welcome back.
how was your trip home?
what's wrong with you?
nothing's wrong. I'm pregnant.
is that a good thing?
Yeah.
Yeah, Will and I have been trying.
it's just...
I never imagined finding out about it here.
well, then...
Congratulations.
there's a call for you from BAU.
some kind of emergency involving Emily?
who's Emily?
God, you're freezing.
how did you find me?
it doesn't matter.
it's taking everything.
I can't...
I think I might break.
no, I...
this has to end.
how did you
I thought you -- I thought you were dead.
I know. They're trying to break you.
I...I must be seeing things.
you have to break.
you can't take much more of this.
no...
the time has come to give up your security codes.
no...
Cruz never officially put his name in for section chief.
well, somebody did.
or he pulled strings, called in favors to get closer to JJ.
Emily, you saw JJ during this time.
did she ever mention Cruz or details of the investigation?
the first thing I'm doing when we get to Paris is having this removed.
how could a brand hurt more than getting staked?
maybe it's a psychosomatic itch you're scratching?
the brand left an emotional toll,
a stake -- I mean you overcame death.
the ultimate victory over your foe.
why suffer a pain you're proud of?
or you could always get another tattoo.
Yeah, something transformative, like a...
a Phoenix.
or a blackbird.
I love the song.
but something tells me I shouldn't tread in your waters.
come on, JJ. Something's obviously different about you.
you commandeered an Interpol jet.
you're profiling me.
why didn't you say your transfer was a backstop?
Oh, I know that look.
the "I can't trust anyone but myself" look. I invented it.
do you ever feel like you're in way over your head?
I got assigned to an information hunt.
instead, I am chasing an unsub who killed my informant.
what would Hotch tell you to do?
focus on victimology, let behavior lead the way.
exactly.
who did your unsub kill?
the one person I was getting through to.
Why?
because I was getting through to...
I was getting through to her.
what if she was about to expose her killer?
someone on the inside?
it sounds like it's time for you to be the blackbird and flip the script.
JJ suspected a double agent.
she could have been talking about Cruz.
if Cruz is working with Askari, why take JJ?
his clearance level is higher than hers.
requires two ranking agents to gain access.
maybe the Integrity systems require the same.
but when agents are compromised, their security privileges are revoked.
JJ's codes shouldn't work.
if he knew what he was doing,
where would he have to do to do that?
straight to the source.
he'd have to hard-line into the servers, but they're scattered all over the country.
it would be difficult to transport JJ and keep to Askari's timeline.
he must have taken her someplace local.
we need to figure out which server they've hacked.
it's ok.
it's ok.
codes confirmed. Now we just need the second user.
I guess we don't need you anymore.
you hurt her, you'll never get my codes.
ever.
welcome back.
thank you.
we're getting nowhere on your inside man theory.
it's because we've been looking in the wrong place.
where should we be looking?
ops.
you think the double agent's one of us?
it would be the perfect infiltration plan.
the mission was need to know.
what are you proposing?
I'm not proposing anything.
we've been authorized to use an off-base location for enhanced interrogation of our own people.
I can't believe Strauss signed off on this.
she didn't.
jackson did.
you went over Strauss?
I didn't think you had it in you.
too many people have died for us.
fall back!
what have you got, Garcia?
I found the relevant servers.
how many were there?
D. C. area, 6.
we need to narrow it down.
we can ping the servers to see who's hard-lined in.
but the second we start knocking, FBI data security is gonna know.
it's not gonna be a big leap to figure out why we're doing this.
we won't be here when they do.
OK. I'm going in.
then we're back to square one.
no, no. We don't have time for that.
it's already been 24 hours.
JJ's beaming out of one of the sites.
we'll work our way down the list.
OK, sir, I'm sending coordinates now.
what happened?
the convoy was attacked.
Hastings?
taken, by Askari's men.
there's something else.
no.
No...No.
I'm so sorry.
your code now, or this time she loses more than her baby.
go to hell.
your code!
did you tell him I was pregnant?
of course not.
I never told anyone.
it's enough.
come out.
who are you talking to?
not to you, to your boss.
come out and face me, you coward.
here, try this.
tea? I'm not drinking tea. JJ's not drinking tea.
you need to calm down. It's been 24 hours, Kevin.
do you know what happens after 24 hours? Because I do.
blackbird. What was that?
what does that mean?
I have no idea.
it's JJ.
how did you know?
Askari couldn't possibly know that I was pregnant.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my husband.
I only told Matt, right before you came and gave me that message from the BAU.
how long were you listening before you approached?
the Humvee attack proved I was right about an inside man.
and look what it cost you.
you can threaten to kill me.
that won't give you what you want.
she's right.
don't I know it.
but I also know you, Matt.
and what line you won't let me cross.
Jareau is your achilles heel.
and I don't blame you.
she is an attractive woman.
don't talk to her, you sick son of a bitch!
no more games.
I want Integrity.
she's the price.
no. No.
maybe...
I can make you one.
another one.
it's pretty standard protocol.
enter your security codes backwards and a preset alarm is activated, in this case, Blackbird.
Oh, God, JJ sent that alert 30 minutes ago.
they must have looped the system.
that's why I couldn't read any hard-lines.
which of the servers send the message?
hands where we can see them.
you don't need to be a linguist to recognize pig Latin.
Luther and Broadchurch is the location of Cramer Industries.
it's a research and development company.
R and D -- that's gotta be a front for clandestine operations.
hang on.
take your time, Matt. I've been thinking about this for years.
Matt, don't.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm fine.
OK, ok, that's it. Just stop!
I'll do it. Just stop.
Where's the server mainframe?
subterranean level.
which way is that?
through the warehouse. Show us.
we're in.
it worked.
start with base security protocols and covert deployments.
now that we have access...
I'll call for helo extraction.
tell the men to meet me upstairs.
you know what to do.
we don't have it all.
we have enough.
it's Hastings.
I don't see Askari. Hastings!
stop! No!
thank you, Matt.
no...
no.
I knew they'd call you.
I knew it.
all right. Shh...
are you ok?
I'm fine. Help Matt, please.
Hastings is headed to the roof.
you have to stop him.
comms aren't working down here.
he's lost a lot of blood. How's JJ?
she's standing, but that's where the hell did she go?
she went to get Hastings.
it's personal for her.
go help her. I've got him.
come on. Come on.
he's headed to the roof!
so is JJ.
I got you!
can you give us a minute, please?
Matt, what you did...
I had your back.
always did.
thank you.
get some rest.
JJ: Nietzsche said, "When you look long into an abyss, the abyss looks into you.
Emily, how much longer do we have you?
Um...6 hours.
Garcia: It's too soon.
it's more than we had yesterday.
Yeah.
I'm just glad I finally got to meet you.
I've heard such amazing things.
all lies.
no. No more lies.
nothing but the truth from now on.
Oh, yeah?
you scared me there.
can I hitch a ride?
look, I'm just trying to get out of the cold, you know?
uh...Yeah. I'm--I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Wh-where did you say you were headed?
anywhere but here.
listen, my wife and I are staying at a motel up the street and there's a bus stop out front.
that's about as far as I can take you.
deal.
OK. Get in.
my name is Alan, by the way. Maya.
where you from?
California.
Oh. You're a long way from home.
how long you been back there?
a couple hours.
don't you have anybody you can call? No.
it's just me.
bus stop
well, here we are.
it's not much, but...
hope it helps.
thank you. Sure.
saw the lights pull up. I was hoping it was you.
I was starting to get worried. It took a little longer than expected.
who is this?
Maya. Gave her a lift from the gas station.
she's gonna catch the bus.
Oh, there's another storm coming who knows how long that'll take?
Oh, you poor thing. You're shivering.
you have to come inside.
we can't let her stay out here. She'll freeze to death.
how does a nice warm shower sound? It sounds amazing.
come on with me, sweetheart. Let me help you with this.
I've got it.
I am crazy about Sam. I like him, like him, like him, but I just--I wish he was more like out-of-the-box take charge kind of guy.
OK, well, what do you mean by "take charge"? Ok. Valentine's day.
I planned everything, from dinner to dessert, and by dessert, I mean me.
and I texted him to tell him about it and he wrote back, "sounds great.
octopus emoticon.
I'm not quite sure I know what that means, but I guess it's kind of sweet.
what's wrong with that? Not you, too.
OK, baby girl, did you tell him about this?
did I tell him... I wanted him to take charge?
not really. Not at all.
OK. Let me let you in on a little secret. Guys, we don't do well with subtle clues. Ok?
you gotta be direct, straight up. Just tell him exactly what you want.
I learn something from you every day.
OK, what about you? Spill it. What are you doing for Valentine's day?
I was thinking about a little candlelit dinner at Le Donkle's overlooking the Potomac.
Ohh...that is romantic.
look at us. We're all grown up. We're like... Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.
and Savannah and Sam. Oh, can Sam be Jennifer Garner?
JJ? JJ.
JJ.
JJ! You're back.
and ready to get to work. How you feeling?
I'm--I'm fine.
don't get me wrong, I love my boys to death, but I was starting to get a little stir crazy.
well, let's do this. Yes.
do you want some tea?
welcome back. You sure two weeks is enough time?
Oh, I'm fine. And, yes, Will made sure I got clearance from two doctors.
glad you're ok. We should get started.
Yes, sir. Pittsburgh field office has reported two murders in the past 48 hours.
both of them were strangled, then stripped down to their underwear and then dumped off of a highway.
have we I. D.'d the victims? - No, not yet.
the guy has a lot of rage.
he's using some kind of ligature, maybe a strap?
it looks like he's choking them intermittently, allowing them to breathe only when he permits it.
but the M. E. report says neither was sexually assaulted.
that's odd given the fact that 80% of crimes against women involve some sort of sexual component.
well, it's the choking that gets him off.
some form of erotic asphyxiation filtered through a psychopath's need for power and control.
OK, what is this? Are they wrapped in shower curtains?
strangely, yes.
which is why I'm checking with a number of manufacturers to see where these were distributed from.
the M. O. says sexual sadist, but the curtain reads as remorse.
sexual sadists don't feel remorse.
maybe it's his shame? Or maybe he's impotent.
he doesn't rape because he can't.
and the embarrassment of not being able to perform manifests in him wrapping up his victims.
he doesn't want to look at them after he kills them.
which points to either symbolic or a literal emasculation.
we need to find out. Wheels up in 30.
OK, your homework was to dig deep and rediscover what sparks your passion.
how's that been going? Mm-hmm.
fine, once he... Finds the time.
Oh, here we go. I didn't say it was your fault, ok?
I'm just--this is what I'm talking about.
look, you two have already tried separation, so the next step is divorce.
but since you're here, I'm assuming you want to save this marriage.
so I'll ask again, how have the last couple of nights been?
fine. A start.
this is never going to work unless you start expressing your feelings.
Oh, right, right. The process.
OK. For the next couple of days I'd like to increase your sessions.
the focus should be about getting back to the basics of being a couple.
I want you guys to be more spontaneous. Go out and enjoy a night on the town.
last night we did something kind of spur of the moment.
and what was that? We checked into a motel.
Where's Alan?
sounds romantic.
there was a spark or two.
it was like our first time all over again.
I get butterflies in my stomach just thinking about it.
now we're finally getting somewhere. You gotta trust the process.
let's build on this. Any plans of doing it again?
definitely. Absolutely.
author Jennifer Smith wrote, "Marriage is a mosaic you build with your spouse, millions of tiny moments that create your love story.
this guy's definitely mobile. We might be looking at a long-distance trucker.
Garcia already checked into it.
she didn't find any major routes in or around the dump sites.
speaking of dump sites, our most recent victim was found 50 miles from where she was last seen.
it looks like security cameras picked her up at a gas station but never saw who she left with.
maybe that's where he found her. It's the perfect hunting ground.
it fits the witness' statements.
according to the cashier, the victim had been there for several hours asking customers for a ride.
well, she lived locally.
she could have made it home in time. Instead, she waited.
she must have been headed some distance. She could be from anywhere.
maybe that's why the unsub chose her. He doesn't just pick victims of opportunity.
he targets women who won't be missed.
good news, crime-fighters.
I tracked the shower curtains this creep has been using to burrito his victims.
turns out they're commercial grade, sold in bulk to a bunch of economy motels, a list of which I just sent you.
it makes sense. It's a secure secondary location.
either he doesn't want to draw attention to his home or someone is living with him.
Rossi, you and Morgan go to the M. E. JJ and Reid, go through Garcia's list of motels.
Blake and I will go to the field office and cover victimology with agent West.
pittsburgh, pennsylvania
local police are canvassing restaurants and gas stations urging female hitchhikers to be on high alert.
it won't completely deter the unsub, but hopefully it will limit his available victim pool.
where are we on identifying the victims? Nothing yet. You guys can work in here.
Thanks.
we should see if there are any unsolved murders that match this unsub's M. O.
the transient nature of the victimology suggests there may be bodies we haven't discovered yet.
I'll have my guys get right on it. Thank you.
these women were just looking for a ride. They never saw the attack coming.
25 an hour, 2-hour minimum.
Hi. Yeah, we'd just like to ask you a couple questions.
we've been canvassing several motels in the area.
it's possible a murder's been committed in one of the rooms.
I haven't seen or heard anything.
do you mind if we take a peek at your guest log or surveillance footage?
we don't have cameras.
we're a cash only, no questions asked type of establishment.
would you mind taking a look at these? Do you recognize anyone?
never seen them before.
this might sound strange, but are any of your rooms missing a shower curtain?
I noticed it wasn't there this morning. The room was totally trashed.
did a real number on the toilet. Got someone coming out to take a look later on today.
did you try plunging it? Do I look like a plumber?
you mind if we take a look? Knock yourself out.
come on, you gotta put your back into it, Spence. Where's Morgan when you need him?
look at this.
it doesn't make sense. The unsub doesn't have sex with his victims.
then why did he need the condom? Well, it takes impotence off the table.
he clearly had intercourse with someone after he committed the murder.
so, he doesn't rape her.
he has sex with someone else in the room. A lover?
who's also his partner in crime.
we're looking for a team.
C. O.D.'s pretty straightforward.
they died of asphyxiation as a result of ligature strangulation.
leather fibers in the cuts makes me think he used some sort of belt.
there's no defensive wounds. Her larynx was completely crushed.
Hey, Rossi, take a look at her fingernails.
for a woman who lives on the streets, she appears well-groomed.
Yeah, it was the same with both victims. I'd say they bathed shortly before the attacks occurred.
between this and the shower curtain, cleanliness is important to them.
that could be part of their ruse. They promise shelter and a warm shower.
which would be a perfect opportunity to carry out a sexual assault, but they don't.
instead, they allow their victims to get partially dressed in their underwear before they kill them.
Why? Because it's not about sex with the victims.
it's about sex with each other.
but if we're dealing with two men who are sadists, they would leave the woman naked to humiliate her.
a female partner might not.
so then we're looking at a male and a female who are most likely in some sort of romantic relationship.
and they're using murder as their foreplay.
you married? Actually divorced.
Why?
I just find it amusing we're paying you for advice on something you failed.
well, there's a lesson in everything.
my marriage taught me patience and understanding, which I try to pass on to my clients.
is that what you tell yourself when you go home to an empty bed at night?
sorry I'm late. Hey, sweetie.
Oh, traffic was a nightmare.
no problem.
here's a question for you. What's your favorite flower?
Uh...pink roses. And when was the last time he bought you some?
Oh, God, it's gotta be years ago. When did I become the bad guy here?
calm down. No, she's clearly picking sides.
see, there's that temper again.
I'm actually proposing that you take charge, starting with the pink roses.
think you can handle that?
for years you've been saying we don't dance enough.
come on.
and your love... If you were listening,
you'd know I was talking about the tango, not ballroom.
just tonight, for just one night, can we not do this?
just give it a chance.
I knew you wanted to smile. Where did you learn how to do that?
I'm gonna show you. I am a natural.
Ohh, I love that cologne on you.
why can't it always be like this?
I'm starting to realize that change doesn't have to be a bad thing.
are you serious? I'm listening.
I'm tired of following your script.
I want to take the lead tonight.
I'll pick a good one. All right.
were you serious?
sweetie, tonight, it's all about you.
it's all about you.
take a look at this. You guys were right.
I was able to match their M. O. to 10 other strangulation murders.
we were only able to identify 4. They've been at it since 1994.
looks like they stopped in 2010 and remained dormant up until now.
something had to prevent them from killing.
maybe one was incarcerated.
I'll start pulling prison records, see if I can't get a match.
these two have been in a relationship a lot longer than we thought.
but even if they broke up, to come back together and resume killing after a 4-year hiatus is rare.
love is strange. It'll make you do the craziest things.
guys, what if they're married?
let me help you with your coat.
your wife mentioned you two were looking to have a good time tonight.
Ah, she did, did she? Isn't he perfect, honey?
hmm. Sweetheart, like I said, tonight's all about you.
well, before we get started, you might want to clean up.
Yeah, sure.
Where's your husband? He stepped out for a sec.
I hope he doesn't mind us getting started without him.
actually, I do mind.
I told you I'd pick a good one.
this is a first for them.
aside from gender, the M. O. is the same.
something in their dynamic must have changed.
a male victim most likely caters to the female unsub's desires.
they haven't displayed that behavior before.
up until now, it appears it's been the male picking the victims.
which typically indicates a dominantsubmissive relationship.
it looks as though her psychopathology could be evolving.
OK, we need to look at this from a marriage perspective.
compromise is the key to any long-term relationship's success.
what if this murder was their way of sharing responsibility?
he let the woman choose the victim. That could be problematic.
now that she's been given control, she might not want to let it go.
dancing.
I'm impressed.
how did all that romance make you feel? Spoiled.
the roses, the dancing.
he gave up a lot to make last night very special.
Yeah, I guess I'm starting to realize that it can't always be about me.
compromise is important. I'm glad you're starting to understand that.
I gotta say, you both are making great progress.
I think I speak for both of us when I say we'd love to make this part of our regular routine again.
we believe we're looking for a married couple, to whom we can attribute at least 13 deaths since 1994.
he's a sexual sadist, and she's a scopophiliac, which is Greek for "love of looking,
meaning that she gets off on watching her husband kill.
like Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo, who raped, tortured and killed at least 19 people, this couple's homicidal tendencies most likely surfaced once they met.
it's possible that the use of a shower curtain is a sign of remorse on the part of the female unsub.
up until now, all the victims were females, so it's possible that the change in victimology could be the husband's way of subjugating his own needs for his wife's happiness.
but a sexual sadist doesn't typically subjugate.
we think he could have committed crimes on the side that have gotten him arrested.
but wouldn't we have the bodies to prove that?
Yes. Which is why we need to take another look at all strangulations within the geographical profile that occurred during the gap years.
without his female partner's influence, the male's independent M. O. should present differently.
learning the nature of how that differs from their team dynamic will be the key to driving a wedge between their partnership.
in the meantime, all transients are at risk.
now that the wife has gotten a taste of control, she'll crave that feeling again.
Yeah!
and if the husband sublimated his needs with the last kill, his desire to fulfill his own will be what's driving him now.
thank you very much.
sweetheart! I'm home.
you're late. Ah. I had a few errands to run.
it took a little longer than expected. You couldn't bother to call?
no, I couldn't, because it would have ruined the surprise.
all that overtime
it finally paid off.
OK, turn around.
the minute I saw it, I knew you had to have it.
you like it? Mm-hmm.
good.
well, that's what I was thinking, Paul. It was 2010 the last time this happened.
boy, he just came out of nowhere this time.
I mean, he was way behind, and somehow he was able to pull it right off.
he's the guy that can do this-- Well, honey, I got a job.
but we're supposed to be going to the movies. The movie starts in an hour.
I'll be back in 30 minutes.
please be on time. I don't want to miss the previews.
sweetie, we won't. I promise.
I have a 1989 strangulation victim dumped 10 miles from where the first body was found, only she was raped and stabbed.
his comfort zone. Could be our unsub.
well, I've got two more, '01 and '03, except these took place in Clifford, Delaware.
the M. O.'s an exact match.
I got another one here from 2013, Scottsdale, Maryland.
he was smart enough to cross state lines.
the Crestview rapist was operating during that time.
the male unsub never went dormant. Only the female did.
so when this guy kills without his wife, his signature changes to stabbing and sexual assault.
well, stabbing is indicative of rage, and it's most likely towards women.
and the sexual assault is his way of establishing dominance over them.
maybe their marriage isn't as solid as we think.
clearly he has issues that he's working out when the wife isn't around.
well, if she emasculates her husband at home, that could be the reason why she now needs to have control over the murders.
Hey, guys, we have a survivor.
Hannah Franklin, a 23-year-old waitress who was attacked on her way home from work back in 2008.
how long is this gonna take? I'm already late for work.
I know this is something you'd like to forget. You're damn right.
I still have nightmares. That guy left me for dead.
why would I want to relive that night?
because if you do, you can stop that night from happening to someone else.
it's not my problem. Ok.
unless that next victim's your daughter.
because it will be someone's daughter, I promise you.
it was...dark. I was on my way home from work.
and I had just cut through a parking lot...
it's ok. Take your time.
I was looking down at my phone. And that's when he pulled me into the alley.
OK, look at me. Look at me.
I need you to tell me what the alley smelled like.
I don't know. All I can smell is his cologne.
OK, then focus on that and let it guide you to the periphery.
Oh, no... What do you see in the alley?
uh, there's a dumpster. Ok, keep going. Keep going.
no, I can't. He's-- he's on top of me. Hannah, you're in a safe place. Ok?
I'm right here with you. No
what else do you see?
there's a couple on the other side of the fence.
they're getting into their car.
I'm trying to scream for help, but his hand is covering
can you make out the type of car?
no. Why not?
there's something in the way. What?
the--the hook.
a hook? What kind of hook?
a fishing hook? An ice hook?
no, larger than that. It's attached to something big.
like a vehicle? There's a large metal arm.
it's a--wait, it's a tow truck. Ok, great.
can you make out any identifying marks? Color? License plate number?
uh, tan, maybe white. I'm not sure.
OK, now focus on him. No...
what is he wearing? Some sort of work uniform.
it's greasy.
OK, now, Hannah-- Hannah, this is important.
does he have on a name patch? Oh, God, it's about to happen!
the patch. Look at the patch, ok?
No! No!
his name was Alan.
OK.
thank you.
it's Alan. Leave a message. Thanks.
Hi, it's me again. Where are you?
I've left you 3 messages.
OK, I'm heading out the door. Bye.
Judith Anderson! FBI!
show us your hands!
drop it!
tell me what's going on. Somebody, please.
what's happening? You have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
she hasn't even said a word. Hasn't even asked where her husband is.
because she knows the answer. She's hiding something.
DNA results. The condom found in the hotel room.
you're gonna want to take a look at that.
Hi, Judith. My name's Alex.
can I get you anything to drink? I'd like to make a phone call.
to who? Your husband?
you're coming up on your 20th anniversary.
Congratulations. That is a huge accomplishment.
we recovered a used condom with Alan's DNA in it.
nothing odd about that, except you've had a hysterectomy.
so, why use condoms if you can't conceive?
you seem to know a lot.
you tell me.
well, you just don't strike me as the unfaithful type.
I mean, Alan, on the other hand, he's a different story.
you know nothing about my husband. Well, actually, I know a lot.
I know your husband tested positive for an STD back in 2010.
you two were married in 1994, which tells me he isn't as committed to your marriage as you think.
there was a point in time when both of us were unfaithful in our marriage.
when I found out he had cheated
you thought if you retaliated it would make you feel better.
my husband and I no longer keep secrets.
I've know he's had an STD for years.
the reason we use condoms, to answer your question, is because he insists on protecting me.
that's how much he loves me.
so she's aware of Alan's indiscretions.
he contracted the STD in 2010.
that's around the same time they went dormant. The first body was found in 1989.
but Judith and Alan weren't married until '94.
which means Alan was doing this on his own 5 years before they met.
and once they were married, there was no conflict until he cheated on her.
that's probably when Judith decided she no longer wanted to participate in the murders.
she took away what he enjoyed doing most.
so she's probably not aware that he continued to kill without her.
Hi, it's me again. Where are you?
I've left you 3 messages. Ok, I'm heading out the door.
Bye. Judith Anderson! FBI!
show us your hands! Drop it!
tell me what's going on. Somebody, please.
what's happening? You have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
I can't wait to see where this is headed.
when you discovered your husband was cheating, you took away the one thing that mattered most to him.
his partner in crime.
now, how do you think he dealt with that?
do you recognize any of these women?
how many times are we gonna go through this? No, I do not.
and these are only a few of the victims that he raped and murdered without you.
and which one do you think gave him the STD?
just take a look for yourself.
his DNA is all over each of these women.
it's the killing without you that's most painful.
it's the cheating that you can't forgive.
you're married. Where's your husband? At home.
and you're here.
what would happen if he were to slip up?
how would you know? A wife knows.
which is why you know I'm telling you the truth.
my husband and I aren't perfect. Look at these women.
look at the way he treated them.
we're rebuilding step by step, brick by brick-- He hates them because he hates you.
he loves me! I want to talk to a lawyer.
I've gotta hand it to her. Judith's not budging.
she's committed to protecting her husband. And their marriage.
we're rebuilding step by step"?
interesting choice of words.
Oh, I've heard those many times before.
marriage counseling.
that would explain how they were able to move through Alan's infidelity.
they were seeing a therapist. Maybe they still are.
green means go.
Garcia, can you check and see if Judith and Alan have a therapist?
checking now...
uh, ok. Looks like they sought help from a bunch of different people, but for the past couple of months, anyway, they've been seeing a Kathleen Benedict several times a week.
says here she specializes in something called insight therapy.
insight therapy is also known as psychodynamic therapy.
it helps patients rediscover what motivates them in an effort to resolve old conflicts.
and if the conflict stems from their marriage, then helping Judith and Alan rediscover what motivates them would reignite their compulsion to kill.
therapy was most likely Judith's idea.
alan doesn't seem like the type to take guidance from a woman.
maybe the emasculation we profiled didn't come from Judith.
maybe it came from the therapist.
Dr. Benedict! Dr. Benedict!
listen, sorry to call you at the last minute.
no, it's fine. Uh, what's going on? Your message sounded urgent.
Oh. Well, Judith and I, we might be going away for a while, so I just wanted to have one more session, get a few things off my chest.
I'm impressed.
I know how hard therapy has been for you.
this is definitely a step in the right direction.
Yeah.
you do something different with your hair?
no.
it looks nice.
here, let me get that for you.
is Judith here yet? Uh, no. She's not coming.
just you and me.
that was Hotch. No sign of Alan at the house.
he's probably aware that we have Judith in custody.
if that's the case, he knows it's only a matter of time before we get to him.
at this point, the guy's got nothing to lose, which makes him more dangerous than ever.
so where is everyone?
Oh, they all took off for the long weekend. You didn't have any plans?
figured I'd use this time to catch up on work.
well, I guess it's just me and you, then, huh?
excuse me. It's my personal line.
sure. This is Kathleen.
Kathleen, my name is Spencer Reid. I'm a federal agent.
right now you need to stay calm and not react. Ok.
is Alan Anderson there with you? Answer yes or no.
Yes, that's correct.
you need to understand that Alan is a dangerous man and he's wanted for several murders.
OK. I understand.
how can I help?
do you think you can get away from there without alerting him?
not at this time. I'm completely booked.
Hello? Do you think he knows?
I think you should step on the gas.
that's one thing I've learned in the 20 years I've been married, is to listen to how a woman speaks on the phone.
I don't know what you're talking about.
you nervous? Alan, you're not being rational right now.
we can talk about whatever's on your mind. Or I can just show you.
No! Aah!
somebody...
somebody, please, please, somebody, please
somebody, please!
you don't know how long I've been waiting for this!
Alan, don't do this-- Shh! Shh! Trust my process.
alan Anderson, FBI!
don't!
it's ok. Hey, you're ok.
the law.
we found Alan. Where is he? Is he ok?
he's fine, and so is Dr. Benedict, who he attempted to rape and kill.
Judith, your husband is going away for a long time, but you don't have to.
if you cooperate, I will move to get your sentence reduced.
this is the last time I'm going to say this.
I will never betray him or my marriage again.
you might want to reconsider that.
he certainly betrays you every chance he gets.
this is Gloria Walters, and the necklace she's wearing was given to her by her fiance.
she was raped and murdered last night by your husband, who we've also identified as the Crestview rapist.
can I see him?
Hey.
sweetheart.
you son of a bitch!
you're a liar. I hate you!
get him out.
I am so sorry. I totally could have made that recipe without cilantro.
it's my fault. I should have disclosed my food allergies.
but I could have asked. Take a breath. The swelling's gone down.
now what are we gonna do for our first Valentine's? Whatever you want to do.
I don't want it to always be up to me.
I thought you liked planning things.
Yeah. But if I'm always the one planning things, then I'm always the one planning things.
you're right.
so I'm gonna make the executive decision that we are spending our first Valentine's day at Patty's.
Patty's, the diner?
Yeah, Patty's the diner.
they have the best milkshakes in town.
come on.
I like milkshakes.
you, come here. Come here.
you know, that's why I blame you. What, me?
Yes. One more time turns into two more times, and now there's no way we're getting a table on such short notice.
girl, look at you. Can you blame me?
but as long as I'm with you, we can go anywhere you want.
Oh, wait a minute. Hello. What are you doing here?
Oh, my God. Penelope?
wow, it is so nice to finally meet you. You, too.
Hey, you must be Sam. Sam I am.
I've heard a lot about you.
Oh. Not guilty. Not guilty.
look at you guys. You're literally flawless.
you're the live-action Ken and Barbie. So where are you guys headed?
uh, well, we actually had a change of plans. Same here.
is what's happening right now what I think is happening right now?
why, I believe so. This is our first double date.
in that case, after you. All right.
and after you, sir.
each relationship nurtures a strength or weakness within you.
michael Murdock.
thank you.
you scared me there.
can I hitch a ride?
look, I'm just trying to get out of the cold, you know?
uh... Yeah.
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Wh-where did you say you were headed?
anywhere but here.
listen, my wife and I are staying at a motel up the street and there's a bus stop out front.
that's about as far as I can take you.
deal. - Ok. Get in.
my name is Alan, by the way.
where you from?
California.
you're a long way from home.
how long you been back there?
a couple hours.
don't you have anybody you can call?
no. It's just me.
well, here we are.
it's not much, but... hope it helps.
thank you.
sure.
saw the lights pull up.
I was hoping it was you.
I was starting to get worried.
it took a little longer than expected.
who is this?
Maya. Gave her a lift from the gas station.
she's gonna catch the bus.
Oh, there's another storm coming who knows how long that'll take?
Oh, you poor thing. You're shivering.
you have to come inside.
we can't let her stay out here. She'll freeze to death.
how does a nice warm shower sound?
it sounds amazing.
come on with me, sweetheart.
let me help you with this. - I've got it.
I am crazy about Sam.
I like him, like him, like him, but I just-- I wish he was more like out-of-the-box take charge kind of guy.
OK, well, what do you mean by "take charge"? - Ok.
Valentine's day.
I planned everything, from dinner to dessert, and by dessert, I mean me.
and I texted him to tell him about it and he wrote back,"sounds great."
octopus emoticon.
I'm not quite sure I know what that means, but I guess it's kind of sweet.
what's wrong with that?
not you, too.
OK, baby girl, did you tell him about this?
did I tell him... I wanted him to take charge?
not really. Not at all.
OK. Let me let you in on a little secret.
guys, we don't do well with subtle clues. Ok?
you gotta be direct, straight up.
just tell him exactly what you want.
I learn something from you every day.
OK, what about you? Spill it.
what are you doing for Valentine's day?
I was thinking about a little candlelit dinner at Le Donkle's overlooking the Potomac.
Ohh...that is romantic.
look at us. We're all grown up.
we're like... Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.
Oh, can Sam be Jennifer Garner?
you're back.
and ready to get to work.
how you feeling?
I'm--I'm fine.
don't get me wrong, I love my boys to death, but I was starting to get a little stir crazy.
well, let's do this.
Yes. - Do you want some tea?
welcome back.
you sure two weeks is enough time?
Oh, I'm fine.
and, yes, Will made sure I got clearance from two doctors.
glad you're ok. We should get started.
Yes, sir.
pittsburgh field office has reported two murders in the past 48 hours.
both of them were strangled, then stripped down to their underwear and then dumped off of a highway.
have we I. D.'d the victims? - No, not yet.
the guy has a lot of rage.
he's using some kind of ligature, maybe a strap?
it looks like he's choking them intermittently, allowing them to breathe only when he permits it.
but the M. E. report says neither was sexually assaulted.
that's odd given the fact that 80% of crimes against women involve some sort of sexual component.
well, it's the choking that gets him off.
some form of erotic asphyxiation filtered through a psychopath's need for power and control.
OK, what is this? Are they wrapped in shower curtains?
strangely, yes.
which is why I'm checking with a number of manufacturers to see where these were distributed from.
the M. O. says sexual sadist, but the curtain reads as remorse.
sexual sadists don't feel remorse.
maybe it's his shame?
or maybe he's impotent.
he doesn't rape because he can't.
and the embarrassment of not being able to perform manifests in him wrapping up his victims.
he doesn't want to look at them after he kills them.
which points to either symbolic or a literal emasculation.
we need to find out.
wheels up in 30.
OK, your homework was to dig deep and rediscover what sparks your passion.
how's that been going?
fine, once he... Finds the time. - Oh, here we go.
I didn't say it was your fault, ok?
I'm just--this is what I'm talking about.
look, you two have already tried separation, so the next step is divorce.
but since you're here, I'm assuming you want to save this marriage.
so I'll ask again, how have the last couple of nights been?
fine. - A start.
this is never going to work unless you start expressing your feelings.
Oh, right, right.
the process.
OK. For the next couple of days I'd like to increase your sessions.
the focus should be about getting back to the basics of being a couple.
I want you guys to be more spontaneous.
go out and enjoy a night on the town.
last night we did something kind of spur of the moment.
and what was that?
we checked into a motel.
Where's Alan?
sounds romantic.
there was a spark or two.
it was like our first time all over again.
I get butterflies in my stomach just thinking about it.
now we're finally getting somewhere.
you gotta trust the process.
let's build on this.
any plans of doing it again?
definitely. - Absolutely.
author Jennifer Smith wrote,"Marriage is a mosaic you build with your spouse, millions of tiny moments that create your love story."
this guy's definitely mobile.
we might be looking at a long-distance trucker.
Garcia already checked into it.
she didn't find any major routes in or around the dump sites.
speaking of dump sites, our most recent victim was found 50 miles from where she was last seen.
it looks like security cameras picked her up at a gas station but never saw who she left with.
maybe that's where he found her.
it's the perfect hunting ground.
it fits the witness' statements.
according to the cashier, the victim had been there for several hours asking customers for a ride.
well, she lived locally. She could have made it home in time. Instead, she waited.
she must have been headed some distance.
she could be from anywhere.
maybe that's why the unsub chose her.
he doesn't just pick victims of opportunity.
he targets women who won't be missed.
good news, crime-fighters.
I tracked the shower curtains this creep has been using to burrito his victims.
turns out they're commercial grade, sold in bulk to a bunch of economy motels, a list of which I just sent you.
it makes sense.
it's a secure secondary location.
either he doesn't want to draw attention to his home or someone is living with him.
Rossi, you and Morgan go to the M. E. JJ and Reid, go through Garcia's list of motels.
Blake and I will go to the field office and cover victimology with agent West.
local police are canvassing restaurants and gas stations urging female hitchhikers to be on high alert.
it won't completely deter the unsub, but hopefully it will limit his available victim pool.
where are we on identifying the victims?
nothing yet. You guys can work in here. - Thanks.
we should see if there are any unsolved murders that match this unsub's M. O.
the transient nature of the victimology suggests there may be bodies we haven't discovered yet.
I'll have my guys get right on it.
thank you.
these women were just looking for a ride.
they never saw the attack coming.
25 an hour, 2-hour minimum.
Yeah, we'd just like to ask you a couple questions.
we've been canvassing several motels in the area.
it's possible a murder's been committed in one of the rooms.
I haven't seen or heard anything.
do you mind if we take a peek at your guest log or surveillance footage?
we don't have cameras.
we're a cash only, no questions asked type of establishment.
would you mind taking a look at these?
do you recognize anyone?
never seen them before.
this might sound strange, but are any of your rooms missing a shower curtain?
I noticed it wasn't there this morning.
the room was totally trashed.
did a real number on the toilet.
got someone coming out to take a look later on today.
did you try plunging it?
do I look like a plumber?
you mind if we take a look?
knock yourself out.
come on, you gotta put your back into it, Spence.
Where's Morgan when you need him?
look at this.
it doesn't make sense.
the unsub doesn't have sex with his victims.
then why did he need the condom?
well, it takes impotence off the table.
he clearly had intercourse with someone after he committed the murder.
so, he doesn't rape her.
he has sex with someone else in the room.
a lover?
who's also his partner in crime.
we're looking for a team.
C. O.D.'s pretty straightforward.
they died of asphyxiation as a result of ligature strangulation.
leather fibers in the cuts makes me think he used some sort of belt.
there's no defensive wounds.
her larynx was completely crushed.
Hey, Rossi, take a look at her fingernails.
for a woman who lives on the streets, she appears well-groomed.
Yeah, it was the same with both victims.
I'd say they bathed shortly before the attacks occurred.
between this and the shower curtain, cleanliness is important to them.
that could be part of their ruse.
they promise shelter and a warm shower.
which would be a perfect opportunity to carry out a sexual assault, but they don't.
instead, they allow their victims to get partially dressed in their underwear before they kill them.
Why? - Because it's not about sex with the victims.
it's about sex with each other.
but if we're dealing with two men who are sadists, they would leave the woman naked to humiliate her.
a female partner might not.
so then we're looking at a male and a female who are most likely in some sort of romantic relationship.
and they're using murder as their foreplay.
you married? - Actually divorced. Why?
I just find it amusing we're paying you for advice on something you failed.
well, there's a lesson in everything.
my marriage taught me patience and understanding, which I try to pass on to my clients.
is that what you tell yourself when you go home to an empty bed at night?
sorry I'm late.
Hey, sweetie.
Oh, traffic was a nightmare.
no problem.
here's a question for you.
what's your favorite flower?
Uh...pink roses.
and when was the last time he bought you some?
Oh, God, it's gotta be years ago.
when did I become the bad guy here?
calm down.
no, she's clearly picking sides.
see, there's that temper again.
I'm actually proposing that you take charge, starting with the pink roses.
think you can handle that?
for years you've been saying we don't dance enough.
come on.
if you were listening, You'd know I was talking about the tango, not ballroom.
just tonight, for just one night, can we not do this?
just give it a chance.
I knew you wanted to smile.
where did you learn how to do that?
I'm gonna show you.
I am a natural.
Ohh, I love that cologne on you.
why can't it always be like this?
I'm starting to realize that change doesn't have to be a bad thing.
are you serious?
I'm listening.
I'm tired of following your script.
I want to take the lead tonight.
I'll pick a good one.
all right. - Were you serious?
sweetie, tonight, it's all about you.
take a look at this.
you guys were right.
I was able to match their M. O. to 10 other strangulation murders.
we were only able to identify 4.
they've been at it since 1994.
looks like they stopped in 2010 and remained dormant up until now.
something had to prevent them from killing.
maybe one was incarcerated.
I'll start pulling prison records, see if I can't get a match.
these two have been in a relationship a lot longer than we thought.
but even if they broke up, to come back together and resume killing after a 4-year hiatus is rare.
love is strange.
it'll make you do the craziest things.
guys, what if they're married?
let me help you with your coat.
your wife mentioned you two were looking to have a good time tonight.
Ah, she did, did she?
isn't he perfect, honey?
sweetheart, like I said, tonight's all about you.
well, before we get started, you might want to clean up.
Yeah, sure.
Where's your husband?
he stepped out for a sec.
I hope he doesn't mind us getting started without him.
actually, I do mind.
I told you I'd pick a good one.
this is a first for them.
aside from gender, the M. O. is the same.
something in their dynamic must have changed.
a male victim most likely caters to the female unsub's desires.
they haven't displayed that behavior before.
up until now, it appears it's been the male picking the victims.
which typically indicates a dominant/submissive relationship.
it looks as though her psychopathology could be evolving.
OK, we need to look at this from a marriage perspective.
compromise is the key to any long-term relationship's success.
what if this murder was their way of sharing responsibility?
he let the woman choose the victim. That could be problematic.
now that she's been given control, she might not want to let it go.
dancing.
I'm impressed.
how did all that romance make you feel?
spoiled.
the roses, the dancing.
he gave up a lot to make last night very special.
Yeah, I guess I'm starting to realize that it can't always be about me.
compromise is important.
I'm glad you're starting to understand that.
I gotta say, you both are making great progress.
we believe we're looking for a married couple, to whom we can attribute at least 13 deaths since 1994.
he's a sexual sadist, and she's a scopophiliac, which is Greek for "love of looking,"
meaning that she gets off on watching her husband kill.
like Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo, who raped, tortured and killed at least 19 people, this couple's homicidal tendencies most likely surfaced once they met.
up until now, all the victims were females, so it's possible that the change in victimology could be the husband's way of subjugating his own needs for his wife's happiness.
but a sexual sadist doesn't typically subjugate.
we think he could have committed crimes on the side that have gotten him arrested.
but wouldn't we have the bodies to prove that?
Yes. Which is why we need to take another look at all strangulations within the geographical profile that occurred during the gap years.
without his female partner's influence, the male's independent M. O. should present differently.
learning the nature of how that differs from their team dynamic will be the key to driving a wedge between their partnership.
in the meantime, all transients are at risk.
now that the wife has gotten a taste of control, she'll crave that feeling again.
Yeah!
and if the husband sublimated his needs with the last kill, his desire to fulfill his own will be what's driving him now.
thank you very much.
sweetheart! I'm home.
you're late.
I had a few errands to run.
it took a little longer than expected.
you couldn't bother to call?
no, I couldn't, because it would have ruined the surprise.
all that overtime-- it finally paid off.
OK, turn around.
the minute I saw it, I knew you had to have it.
you like it?
good.
well, that's what I was thinking, Paul.
it was 2010 the last time this happened.
boy, he just came out of nowhere this time.
I mean, he was way behind, and somehow he was able to pull it right off.
he's the guy that can do this.
well, honey, I got a job.
but we're supposed to be going to the movies.
the movie starts in an hour.
I'll be back in 30 minutes.
please be on time.
I don't want to miss the previews.
sweetie, we won't. I promise.
I have a 1989 strangulation victim dumped 10 miles from where the first body was found, only she was raped and stabbed.
his comfort zone.
could be our unsub.
well, I've got two more,'01 and '03, except these took place in Clifford, Delaware.
the M. O.'s an exact match.
I got another one here from 2013, Scottsdale, Maryland.
he was smart enough to cross state lines.
the Crestview rapist was operating during that time.
the male unsub never went dormant. Only the female did.
so when this guy kills without his wife, his signature changes to stabbing and sexual assault.
well, stabbing is indicative of rage, and it's most likely towards women.
and the sexual assault is his way of establishing dominance over them.
maybe their marriage isn't as solid as we think.
clearly he has issues that he's working out when the wife isn't around.
well, if she emasculates her husband at home, that could be the reason why she now needs to have control over the murders.
Hey, guys, we have a survivor.
Hannah Franklin, a 23-year-old waitress who was attacked on her way home from work back in 2008.
how long is this gonna take?
I'm already late for work.
I know this is something you'd like to forget.
you're damn right.
I still have nightmares.
that guy left me for dead.
why would I want to relive that night?
because if you do, you can stop that night from happening to someone else.
it's not my problem.
OK. Unless that next victim's your daughter.
because it will be someone's daughter, I promise you.
it was...dark.
I was on my way home from work.
and I had just cut through a parking lot...
it's ok. Take your time.
I was looking down at my phone.
and that's when he pulled me into the alley.
OK, look at me.
look at me.
I need you to tell me what the alley smelled like.
I don't know.
all I can smell is his cologne.
OK, then focus on that and let it guide you to the periphery.
Oh, no... - What do you see in the alley?
uh, there's a dumpster.
OK, keep going.
keep going. - No, I can't.
he's-- he's on top of me.
Hannah, you're in a safe place. Ok?
I'm right here with you.
what else do you see?
there's a couple on the other side of the fence.
they're getting into their car.
I'm trying to scream for help, but his hand is covering.
can you make out the type of car?
no. - Why not?
there's something in the way.
what?
the--the hook.
a hook?
what kind of hook? A fishing hook? An ice hook?
no, larger than that.
it's attached to something big.
like a vehicle?
there's a large metal arm.
it's a--wait, it's a tow truck.
OK, great. Can you make out any identifying marks? Color?
license plate number?
uh, tan, maybe white.
I'm not sure.
OK, now focus on him.
no... What is he wearing?
some sort of work uniform.
it's greasy.
OK, now, Hannah-- Hannah, this is important.
does he have on a name patch?
Oh, God, it's about to happen!
the patch.
look at the patch, ok?
No! No!
Alan. His name was Alan.
OK.
thank you.
it's Alan. Leave a message. Thanks.
Hi, it's me again. Where are you?
I've left you 3 messages.
OK, I'm heading out the door. Bye.
show us your hands!
drop it!
tell me what's going on. Somebody, please.
what's happening?
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
she hasn't even said a word.
hasn't even asked where her husband is.
because she knows the answer.
she's hiding something.
DNA results.
the condom found in the hotel room.
you're gonna want to take a look at that.
Hi, Judith. My name's Alex. Can I get you anything to drink?
I'd like to make a phone call.
to who?
your husband?
you're coming up on your 20th anniversary.
Congratulations.
that is a huge accomplishment.
we recovered a used condom with Alan's DNA in it.
nothing odd about that, except you've had a hysterectomy.
so, why use condoms if you can't conceive?
you seem to know a lot.
you tell me.
well, you just don't strike me as the unfaithful type.
I mean, Alan, on the other hand, he's a different story.
you know nothing about my husband.
well, actually, I know a lot.
I know your husband tested positive for an STD back in 2010.
you two were married in 1994, which tells me he isn't as committed to your marriage as you think.
there was a point in time when both of us were unfaithful in our marriage.
when I found out he had cheated.
you thought if you retaliated it would make you feel better.
my husband and I no longer keep secrets.
I've know he's had an STD for years.
the reason we use condoms, to answer your question, is because he insists on protecting me.
that's how much he loves me.
so she's aware of Alan's indiscretions.
he contracted the STD in 2010.
that's around the same time they went dormant.
the first body was found in 1989.
but Judith and Alan weren't married until '94.
which means Alan was doing this on his own 5 years before they met.
and once they were married, there was no conflict until he cheated on her.
that's probably when Judith decided she no longer wanted to participate in the murders.
she took away what he enjoyed doing most.
so she's probably not aware that he continued to kill without her.
Hi, it's me again. Where are you?
I've left you 3 messages.
OK, I'm heading out the door. Bye.
show us your hands!
drop it!
tell me what's going on. Somebody, please. What's happening?
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
I can't wait to see where this is headed.
when you discovered your husband was cheating, you took away the one thing that mattered most to him.
his partner in crime.
now, how do you think he dealt with that?
do you recognize any of these women?
how many times are we gonna go through this?
no, I do not.
and these are only a few of the victims that he raped and murdered without you.
and which one do you think gave him the STD?
just take a look for yourself.
his DNA is all over each of these women.
it's the killing without you that's most painful.
it's the cheating that you can't forgive.
you're married. Where's your husband?
at home.
and you're here.
what would happen if he were to slip up?
how would you know?
a wife knows.
which is why you know I'm telling you the truth.
my husband and I aren't perfect. - Look at these women.
look at the way he treated them.
we're rebuilding step by step, brick by brick
he hates them because he hates you.
he loves me!
I want to talk to a lawyer.
I've gotta hand it to her.
Judith's not budging.
she's committed to protecting her husband.
"we're rebuilding step by step"?
interesting choice of words.
Oh, I've heard those many times before.
marriage counseling.
that would explain how they were able to move through Alan's infidelity.
they were seeing a therapist.
maybe they still are.
green means go.
Garcia, can you check and see if Judith and Alan have a therapist?
checking now... Uh, ok.
looks like they sought help from a bunch of different people, but for the past couple of months, anyway, they've been seeing a Kathleen Benedict several times a week.
says here she specializes in something called insight therapy.
insight therapy is also known as psychodynamic therapy.
it helps patients rediscover what motivates them in an effort to resolve old conflicts.
and if the conflict stems from their marriage, then helping Judith and Alan rediscover what motivates them would reignite their compulsion to kill.
therapy was most likely Judith's idea.
alan doesn't seem like the type to take guidance from a woman.
maybe the emasculation we profiled didn't come from Judith.
maybe it came from the therapist.
Dr. Benedict! Dr. Benedict!
listen, sorry to call you at the last minute.
no, it's fine.
uh, what's going on?
your message sounded urgent.
well, Judith and I, we might be going away for a while, so I just wanted to have one more session, get a few things off my chest.
I'm impressed.
I know how hard therapy has been for you.
this is definitely a step in the right direction.
Yeah.
you do something different with your hair?
no.
it looks nice.
here, let me get that for you.
is Judith here yet?
uh, no. She's not coming. Just you and me.
that was Hotch.
no sign of Alan at the house.
he's probably aware that we have Judith in custody.
if that's the case, he knows it's only a matter of time before we get to him.
at this point, the guy's got nothing to lose, which makes him more dangerous than ever.
so where is everyone?
Oh, they all took off for the long weekend.
you didn't have any plans?
figured I'd use this time to catch up on work.
well, I guess it's just me and you, then, huh?
excuse me.
it's my personal line.
sure.
this is Kathleen.
Kathleen, my name is Spencer Reid.
I'm a federal agent.
right now you need to stay calm and not react.
OK.
is Alan Anderson there with you? Answer yes or no.
Yes, that's correct.
you need to understand that Alan is a dangerous man and he's wanted for several murders.
OK. I understand.
how can I help?
do you think you can get away from there without alerting him?
not at this time.
I'm completely booked.
Hello?
do you think he knows?
I think you should step on the gas.
that's one thing I've learned in the 20 years I've been married, is to listen to how a woman speaks on the phone.
I don't know what you're talking about.
you nervous?
Alan, you're not being rational right now.
we can talk about whatever's on your mind.
or I can just show you.
No!
somebody... Somebody, please, please, somebody, please.
somebody, please!
you don't know how long I've been waiting for this!
Alan, don't do this-- Shh!
trust my process.
don't!
it's ok. Hey, you're ok.
we found Alan.
where is he? Is he ok?
he's fine, and so is Dr. Benedict, who he attempted to rape and kill.
Judith, your husband is going away for a long time, but you don't have to.
if you cooperate, I will move to get your sentence reduced.
this is the last time I'm going to say this.
I will never betray him or my marriage again.
you might want to reconsider that.
he certainly betrays you every chance he gets.
this is Gloria Walters, and the necklace she's wearing was given to her by her fiance.
she was raped and murdered last night by your husband, who we've also identified as the Crestview rapist.
can I see him?
sweetheart.
you son of a bitch!
you're a liar.
I hate you!
get him out.
I am so sorry.
I totally could have made that recipe without cilantro.
it's my fault.
I should have disclosed my food allergies.
but I could have asked.
take a breath.
the swelling's gone down.
now what are we gonna do for our first Valentine's?
whatever you want to do.
I don't want it to always be up to me.
I thought you liked planning things.
Yeah. But if I'm always the one planning things, then I'm always the one planning things.
you're right.
so I'm gonna make the executive decision that we are spending our first Valentine's day at Patty's.
Patty's, the diner?
Yeah, Patty's the diner.
they have the best milkshakes in town.
come on.
I like milkshakes.
you, come here. Come here.
you know, that's why I blame you.
what, me?
Yes. One more time turns into two more times, and now there's no way we're getting a table on such short notice.
girl, look at you. Can you blame me?
but as long as I'm with you, we can go anywhere you want.
Oh, wait a minute.
hello. What are you doing here?
Oh, my God.
wow, it is so nice to finally meet you.
you, too.
Hey, you must be Sam.
Sam I am.
I've heard a lot about you.
not guilty. Not guilty.
look at you guys.
you're literally flawless.
you're the live-action Ken and Barbie.
so where are you guys headed?
uh, well, we actually had a change of plans.
same here.
is what's happening right now what I think is happening right now?
why, I believe so.
this is our first double date.
in that case, after you.
all right.
and after you, sir.
want to get out of your seatbelt for me?
I did it!
you did?
Yeah, mama.
I always do it. It's so easy!
is it so easy?
let's go see your Auntie Sue.
Oh, I'm so excited.
Where's Hillary the hippo?!
where is Hillary the hippo?!
I don't know!
Oh, my goodness! You think I'd forget her?
thank you, mama. Can I go play in that?
I don't know. You'll have to ask your Aunt Sue first.
well, who is this little house mouse?
it's me!
Hello, me. Nice to meet you. I'm Sue.
you're silly.
can I go play in there?
heck, yeah. I got it just for you.
you did? Where?
neighbor down the street.
I gave him 10 bucks for it. Pretty good, huh?
Yeah!
you can go play.
OK, look, Rodney is gonna kill me if I miss this plane, so, here are some mac and cheese two-fer coupons and some cash.
it's not a whole lot, but it'll get you through a couple drive-thrus.
and no sodas. Milk.
my cell phone's not gonna work on the cruise, I don't think, so if something happens, just call the travel agent?
Oh, God, maybe I should just cancel this whole trip.
are you kidding me? You win an amazing raffle and you want to cancel it? That's crazy.
honey, you're going and you're going right now.
I've just never left her for a whole week before.
relax. Get drunk, get laid, we've got this.
right, Gabby?
Yeah.
wait, I'm coming out.
come here.
give me a hug.
I love you, and you listen to your Aunt Sue, ok?
OK, mama.
I...Love...You!
have fun. Bye, I love you.
can we play in the house now?
say bye, mommy.
Bye!
I love you!
love you more.
we'll miss you.
you want to have some fun?
Yeah.
OK. Let's be fairies.
you got your wings?
Yeah.
OK.
you need a jacket, honey.
it's cold.
I'm fine, Daphnie, thank you.
Oh, poor thing. Can't sleep again, huh?
been away from her mama about a week.
Yeah, she's fine during the day.
it's just at nighttime is a bit of trouble.
I'm glad to see the quiet drives are helping.
always worked with my babies.
have a nice sleep, little one.
night night.
night night.
you buckled up. - Yeah. Ok.
uh, milk, sorry.
Hey, slow down, shorty.
Hey, 6.50 on number 2.
there's a line, Willie.
just turn on the pump, man.
baby, you need a hand?
cause as you can see, I got very big hands.
I'm fine, thank you.
sure is one fine little lady, though.
help! Help! Somebody, help!
help! Someone call 911!
somebody help! The baby's gone!
help! Call 911! My baby's gone!
please call!
please! Call 911!
Aah! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Aah!
help!
why would anyone leave a little girl alone in a car at night?
sue told local authorities that she was a couple blocks from her house, she didn't want to wake Gabby up, she was in and out of that mini mart in under 4 minutes.
that's a pretty tight window of opportunity.
whoever took her must have been stalking them.
is there a history of child abductions in this area?
no, but the local registry shows a high concentration of sex offenders.
we have no time to waste.
we do have an eyewitness, but his recollection's limited to a dark van that he saw pull up next to Sue's car.
that's pretty vague.
so we don't have a color or know who was driving.
are their surveillance cameras on the premises?
Yes, there was one camera, it's in the store, and it's ancient, but the footage is being sent to the lab right now for enhancement.
SSA Canning is on scene with the southeast regional CARD team.
they're conducting neighborhood and roadblock canvasses.
we all know what to do. If this is a stranger abduction, we've got fewer than 24 hours to bring Gabby back alive.
Garcia, where are Gabby's parents?
away, but not together.
they're divorced.
mom, Kate, is coming back from a Caribbean cruise with her new boyfriend.
and Doug, Gabby's bio dad, is a long-haul trucker who is on the road.
and this is where bad turns to worse.
dad has a history of drug problems.
since Gabby's under 5 years old and her father's whereabouts are unknown, statistics say he's more likely the offender than the stranger abduction.
he could have been the one who stalked them and grabbed Gabby.
Morgan, you and JJ head over to Sue Walsh's house.
see if any of the neighbors have seen Gabby's father lurking around.
all right. Got it.
5 hours and 23 minutes since Gabby was taken.
witness pulled up to pump number 2 here, saw the van parked there.
blocked his view of Sue's car.
said the brake lights were on.
the driver could have kept his foot on the brake while someone else used the sliding door to grab her.
it'd be smart to use a partner out in the open like this.
we have 9 registered sex offenders within 3 miles.
sometimes they work in tandem.
we have teams going door to door now.
that's good, cover your bases.
but it's the ones we don't know about who are the most dangerous.
what's the word on the parents?
mom and boyfriend Rodney are confirmed off CONUS.
they'll be at the P. D. soon.
we have any location on the biological father yet?
still not answering his cell phone.
it's not pinging off any towers, either.
so he shut his cell phone off.
that's odd for a trucker.
unless it's a countermeasure.
the dark van could have just been a transport vehicle to get Gabby to his truck.
you're thinking he waited for the opportunity to take her?
he has motivation given that he lost custody.
we should check rest stops for his truck as well.
the problem is interstate 59 is just 3 blocks away, and it goes to Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia.
we've got the borders covered.
nobody's getting out of here without a fight.
agent Canning, can you get video footage for us from a 5-mile radius?
we need to see if there's any video of this dark van coming or going.
not much hope there. Katrina took out a lot of the security and traffic cams. They haven't been replaced.
is Sue inside? We need to talk to her.
an agent drove her home and is staying with her in case there are any ransom demands.
she's a wreck. Not sure you'll get anything new.
excuse me.
all right. Blake, you and Reid stay with Canning's people.
if Gabby was a victim of opportunity, then the unsubs didn't have a plan and they could still be in the area.
Dave and I will go to the police station and interview Kate and the boyfriend.
is she awake?
did you find Gabby?
no, not yet.
but we could use your help.
I'm Agent Jareau. This is Agent Morgan.
mind if we have a seat?
Oh, I'm sorry. Have a seat.
so, um, when we handle these cases
when we handle these cases, we start by eliminating family and work our way out from there.
so, do you have any brothers or sisters?
no.
Kate's the only family that I got.
she's more like a sister to me than a cousin.
her parents took me in after mine died.
I'm so sorry. How old were you?
8
I'm sorry.
it's all right. We know this is a tough time.
did anyone take special interest in Gabby since you've had her?
no. No.
I always had her right by my side of me...
except...
I was only gone like one second.
I got her to sleep finally and I didn't want to wake her.
there's nothing you can do about that now, ok?
you just need to focus on finding her.
so think back.
was there a deliveryman? A service worker?
no.
a neighbor?
no, nobody.
I don't know, maybe everybody.
I mean, she's so nice. She smiles at everybody.
what about her father?
have you seen him? Has he contacted you?
no. He's always on the road. He never calls.
did he know that you were watching Gabby?
I don't think so.
OK, Sue. Do you know anyone with a dark van?
no. No.
I'm sorry. I just can't even believe this is happening right now.
well, you're the best at finding kids.
you're gonna find Gabby, right?
God, just tell me something,'cause right now all I can tell myself is I never, ever should have left her.
I need your help.
anything.
tell me about Gabby.
she's just about the sweetest little girl you've ever met.
and how long have you been seeing Kate?
almost a year.
she's the best person I know.
nearly eloped on that cruise, but we wanted Gabby there for it.
has Gabby ever wandered off with anyone?
no.
a stranger?
no. There's just no way.
I warned her too much about that.
what about with someone she knew?
like who?
Doug? He hasn't seen her for almost a year.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, you think that man took my little girl?
do you know where Doug is right now?
he's on the road, somewhere.
Oh, God, he did it, didn't he?
he swore that he would get back at me for leaving him and he's finally done it.
we don't know that.
but that son of a bitch is your number one suspect, isn't he?
how would you get in touch with him if it were an emergency?
he has two cell phone numbers.
one is personal and one is a company road one for emergencies.
Garcia, I need you to track GPS on this cell phone number.
think maybe she might know a thing or two about what goes on around here?
kind of late to be taking the trash out, isn't it?
they only come once a week and I don't want the house stinking.
you here to find Gabby?
Yeah. And we could use your help.
when's the last time you saw her?
when Sue took her for a ride.
Yeah. A few hours ago?
I don't sleep so good anymore.
any little noise wakes me.
have you seen a dark van?
not tonight.
but one came through the other day.
think he's a plumber.
can you remember the company name?
all right. Thank you.
she's seen a van.
please tell me she's safe.
not yet, but we've got a lead on a dark van.
it could belong to a plumber.
check local businesses.
well, that's hardly anything.
you've had less. - True.
come on, baby girl, we need an I. D. and location right now.
uh, there are 4 plumbers in the immediate area.
I'm pulling registrations.
uh, white minivans are all the rage.
there's the little family plumber.
they have a bluish van that's dark.
run employee background checks.
won't be hard. It's only the owner and his nephew, Ian Little, 25.
he was released last year, for slinging bennies and heroin.
where is he now?
sleeping, I imagine.
I'm sending you his home address. There it is.
hattiesburg P. D. got a call about an abandoned truck.
found the phone under the seat.
just got confirmation. Truck belongs to Doug Hoffer, Gabby's father.
this is only 5 miles from the abduction site.
it was smart to leave it out here.
the property owners streamed the video from that camera to my phone.
we have the truck being parked here Sunday.
did he walk back into town?
no. A little tough to see, but he was definitely picked up by a dark minivan.
tell me you have a license plate.
Yeah. Just I. D.'d the owner.
what is he doing here?
what the hell happened to his face?
you know him.
Yeah. Doug used to buy drugs from him.
do you think Ian helped him take Gabby?
what's his story?
claims he hasn't seen Gabby in months but admits, that he picked up Doug on Sunday.
well, he's smart to admit it, since we've got his mug on surveillance cameras.
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.
those look like second- and third-degree burns.
he hasn't had proper medical attention.
looks infected.
says he was trying to light his gas grill and he left the propane on while he went back inside to get matches.
he returned, struck the match, and it blew up in his face.
Oh, that doesn't make sense. Propane dissipates.
it would take serious flames to curl around and burn behind his ears.
who gets those kind of burns who doesn't go to the hospital?
JJ: Someone who has something to hide.
there are no calls, but Ian's cell pinged off of 3 cell phone towers outside of town on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.
I sent you the locations.
cell tower range and directionality can be dramatically influenced by atmospheric, electromagnetic, and traffic capacity variations.
Meaning?
a cell phone can travel to the same location but ping off of different towers on different days due to independent outside variables.
Garcia, can you see what's at this intersection point?
39-30 latitude, negative 89-42 longitude.
uh, that would be the old Little farm.
and that's Little, not like diminutive, but Little family. That's where Ian grew up.
so Doug went missing 3 nights ago and Ian's been at that farm each night since then.
holy crappy childhood.
you can't make this kind of sadness up.
it's also the place where Ian's dad killed his mother with a shotgun and then turned it on himself.
I'm Agent Hotchner. I don't have any time to waste, so I'm going to give you once chance to answer my questions.
I know the story about how you got these burns is a lie.
these are the kinds of burns we see when people add gasoline to a fire, like when they're trying to get rid of a body.
is that what you did? Yes or no.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I also know exactly where you spent the last 3 nights.
you picked up Doug on Sunday and you let him hide here, didn't you?
he waited there for a few days, you drove him into town in your van to try to abduct his daughter, and something went wrong and Doug hurt Gabby and you were left with a dead little girl and you thought you knew how to get rid of her.
I want a lawyer.
that's all right.
I have my answers.
I have a team searching the farm right now, and they will find the body.
who the hell is that?
it's our main suspect.
searched the entire property.
we found Ian's van in the barn.
no sign of Gabby anywhere. What have you got?
coroner says Doug died from blunt force trauma to the head.
then it looks like Ian tried to burn Doug's body here, which, of course, was harder than he thought it would be, so then he dumped Doug's body in the water.
even wrapped the body, weighed it down with rocks.
could it be remorse?
it's more like concealment. We see it a lot when there's a connection between the vic and the killer.
coroner says Doug's been dead for at least 72 hours.
that would be the same day he got here.
so what did this guy do to get himself killed?
let me make sure I understand, agent.
you said that Gabby was never there.
that's right, she wasn't. But Ian killed Doug.
he must have had something to do with taking her.
let me talk to Ian.
I'm sorry, we can't let you do that.
no, but he will talk to me.
well, oh, God, when Doug and I first got together, we smoked a little weed with Ian, and then I got pregnant with Gabby and I realized that I needed to quit all that stuff.
you know, I--I wanted to be a good mom.
I'm just saying that Ian and I go way back, and he will tell me stuff that he may not tell you guys.
because, honestly, him hurting Gabby just-- it doesn't make any sense to me.
I'm sorry, but Ian isn't speaking to anyone, except maybe a lawyer.
I'm so sorry.
card team found this on the interstate.
what is it?
it looks like Gabby's blanket to me. Ask your client.
I have no idea.
I advise you not to waste my time.
where is Gabby? Where is she?!
I don't know. I swear.
I'm sorry. I just ran in for a second.
I would never leave her like that.
OK, I understand this is difficult, but what I need you both to do right now is focus on finding Gabby, getting her back in your arms.
can you do that?
OK.
excuse me.
the mini mart video's back from the lab.
I've looked through the whole thing. Sue's story holds up.
fast-forward to Sue's arrival at 10: 03 p. m.
cashier was the only one inside until then.
hold on.
let me rewind.
right there--is that Sue's shirt?
hmm. She didn't mention walking to the door and then turning around.
how long before she actually goes in?
two minutes later.
maybe she was worried about leaving Gabby alone in the car.
well, there were plenty of places to park right in front of the store.
she chose the side. No windows, no lights.
she told us she didn't want the lights or the noise to wake Gabby up.
right, but as a woman, especially one with a small child, safety comes first. It's instinctual to find a quick, well-lit journey from your parked car to the door.
it could have been a trial run.
we see that in inexperienced criminals who need to build up their nerve.
wait a minute. You thinking she did all of this?
go.
see if there's any recent contact between Ian Little and Sue Walsh.
scanning slimeball's cell now.
not a lot of repeat numbers.
OK.
Oh, there are dozens of calls to and from this number, though, and I'm gonna cross-check it with Sue Walsh's home.
we have a match. Yeah.
they talked. They talked.
here you go.
Oh, thanks.
thank you.
sue, we need a formal statement.
would you mind coming with me.
Oh, of course not.
did you ever have any hesitation leaving Gabby with Sue?
well, why would I?
like a mother's intuition thing.
did you ever feel like there was anything wrong?
sue didn't have a problem with it, and Gabby's spent the night there before.
why are you asking me this?
we're trying to put some missing pieces together.
OK.
do you know Ian Little?
kind of. He comes into the diner a few times a week.
we've got phone records that show you talk to Ian...
a lot.
please don't tell Kate.
I mean, she never would have let Gabby come over if she knew that he was coming around.
why is a smart girl like you hanging out with this guy?
he's better now. He's cleaned up.
and he's different with me.
I'm really good for him.
you lost your parents when you were young.
what does that have to do with anything?
well, maybe it gives you the attention that you need.
Yeah, I guess so.
you say Ian's clean?
is he still dealing?
I don't think so.
then why would Ian kill Gabby's father?
uh...I don't know.
maybe it was an old grudge or a bad deal or something.
OK.
now...
we need your full statement.
OK.
are you sure you'll be able to write with that hand?
Oh. Yeah.
uh, Gabby broke a glass.
kids.
uh, what exactly am I supposed to write?
just tell us what happened.
OK.
we know that Ian picked up Doug on Sunday, then he was killed.
what if they surprised Sue at the house?
and Doug was threatening to take Gabby.
they could have been trying to protect Gabby from him and he was killed by accident.
except they went to extravagant lengths to cover it up.
OK, that may be true, but it still doesn't answer where Gabby is or what anyone's motivation is in hurting her.
we can keep theorizing, but every minute we do is a minute Gabby's out there.
we want the truth from your client.
what are you offering?
that depends on whether he fully cooperates.
my client did not kill Doug Hoffer.
he only disposed of the body.
prove it, and the AUSA has agreed to plead him from murder to accessory after the fact.
he knows who did it.
that's hearsay, it's not proof.
she cut her hand when she hit him with that candleholder.
they were arguing by the front door.
she's my daughter, and I am going to see her.
Doug went in to go get Gabby out of bed.
sue picks up this candleholder and hit him really hard with it.
it sounded really bad.
it was heavy glass and it broke when she hit him again.
her blood was all over.
guys, over here.
Ian: So was Doug's.
she hid it in a shoebox in the closet.
why would she keep the murder weapon?
she thinks she's too smart to get caught.
are you all right?
did you find Gabby?
what do you think?
are we gonna find her?
Kate trusted you with the care of her child.
you were responsible for this little girl.
you had a duty to protect her, and you failed, miserably.
what happened to Gabby is all your fault.
you know nothing about what it takes to be a mother.
you're pathetic.
Aah! You son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!
get off me!
get off me! No!
No! Get off me!
talk about taking one for the team.
what was that all about?
if she's a predisposed female offender, a major indicator is uncontrolled rage when challenged.
I'd say she passed the test.
she has no criminal record, no history of violence.
they're very good at concealment.
they're also the rarest type.
the go after young children in their care, and their offenses can be sadistic, brutal, sometimes bizarre.
the blunt force trauma that killed Doug says that she has serious violence issues.
something must have triggered that rage.
whatever it was, I'm afraid of what that means for Gabby.
I know Sue is not gonna talk to us, but maybe she would talk to Kate.
she did that to you and you want Kate going in there?
Rodney, I've got to go talk to her.
she's restrained. I will be at the door.
there's nothing she can do physically to hurt her.
what is wrong with you?
you still don't get it, do you?
I trusted you.
and I trusted you.
what are you talking about?
when I moved into your perfect little house, your perfect little street, everybody told me that I lucked out, that I got myself a good family.
well, I had a good family. I didn't want yours.
what happened to your family wasn't fair, but why would you take that out on Gabby?
at first I thought that it wasn't only me that he touched.
what are you talking about?
where is Gabby?
Gabby's gone.
what?
now you know how I used to feel.
like there's no air left.
where?
for a really long time, I thought that's just how things worked in your family.
cause your dad liked me to sit on his lap, till it got more than that.
I used to stay up late at night to see if he opened your door, too.
but he didn't.
just mine.
he always did say that I was his special little girl.
that's not true.
my dad never touched you.
he used to put me on the floor 'cause it was quieter.
when he was done, I'd put the lightbug on and I'd go under the bed.
that's where I sleep, but not you.
you got all the good memories.
you're insane.
maybe I am.
what does that make you?
you left your kid for 5 days.
all I know is that I will never let mine out of my sight.
she'll be here in the summertime.
Oh, my God.
she mixed her past and present tenses, which shows unconscious deception.
have a seat.
Oh, God, she never mentioned Gabby.
and she said my dad-- oh, God.
don't let her get to you. Your dad's a good man.
we all know she's lying.
she's never going to tell us where Gabby is.
you got her to reveal more than you know.
Kate's right. Sue's never gonna tell us where Gabby is.
it's her final move to punish Kate.
she wants to inflict maximum pain upon Kate.
so you're thinking she'll do whatever it takes to make Kate suffer and keep on suffering.
not knowing what happened to your child would be the ultimate torture for any parent.
but if Sue killed Gabby, chances are eventually we'd find the body.
she'd need to find a way to get rid of her permanently, without killing her.
nothing's out of place.
in fact, all of Gabby's things are packed up as if she was preparing to go back home.
that's strong evidence of a false allegation.
so all of this was arranged by Sue for what, to get back at Kate?
you should have seen her with Kate.
she was relentlessly sadistic.
so Sue planned this with whoever was in the dark van.
but there doesn't seem to be any paper trail of it here.
and there's not electronic trail either. There's no computer or cell phone.
outside of a land line, this girl's living tech-free.
that's because she's hiding something.
Yeah. I agree.
Thanks.
I'm going to call Garcia.
mama, is it even possible for somebody to live completely offline these days?
sure, if you live in an Afghani cave or certain parts of New Jersey.
other than that, not so much.
we can't even find an Internet connection or any communication device in Sue's home.
what, so she's like old school? Snail mail? Cash transactions?
Yeah, but somehow she had to connect with whoever actually grabbed Gabby.
a girl like that's gotta go online somewhere.
well, she doesn't have much money. She'd have to do it cheap.
Well--ok, I started my illustrious career on the web at the library, because the computers and the Internet are free.
she could have done that using pseudonyms and anonymizers.
I--I know all this, but I'm gonna need some help if I want to narrow it down quickly.
OK, call Blake.
maybe she got something out of Sue's written statement.
good. Yes, and thank you. I'm on the trail.
Blake, I need your word wisdom to help me track Sue's online activity.
well, the only thing that stuck out was her use of lightbug instead of lightbulb.
I heard her say it to Kate and noticed it in her statement, too.
Lightbug. Got it.
I'll switch the lightbug off in the car so no one will see.
where did you find that?
backtracking now...
Oh, no.
it's an online forum discussing a troubled 4-year-old girl.
any identifying information on who she's talking to?
give me a minute. Give me a minute.
no, oh, no. This is gonna be a dead end.
what happened?
libraries that don't want Feds tracking what their patrons are reading or surfing on the web, they erase their servers at the end of the night.
can you recover the files?
if it were done, t'were well it were done quickly.
OK, it's still early.
maybe they haven't written over the files yet.
Yes! Ok, I've got an IP address fragment and...
Gabby's not the only baby on that forum that's being discussed.
Garcia, I need to know everything that you can find about anyone communicating with Sue.
Yeah. Yeah. I'm good.
Oh, my God. Oh, no, no, no.
sue gave Gabby away.
who has her, Garcia?
I don't know. I don't
OK. I don't know, but I'm gonna send you this online investigative report right now.
read this, and I'm gonna find out who. I'm gonna find out who.
disrupted adoptions?
that's what the people involved are calling it.
they're also referring to it as re-homing.
and it's been happening underground for some time now.
until now, it's mainly been overwhelmed adoptive parents of problem children from overseas.
good people go on the site looking for guidance or services, but bad people offer to take problem kids off their hands as a last resort.
so they just give them away to some random couple?
calling them couples is a bit generous.
the article talks about these people who pose as families, but really, they're just freaks looking for access to kids.
and no one's keeping track of them.
why isn't this illegal?
Well,'cause it's a relatively new practice, and unsurprisingly, no legislation's been written yet.
so how did Sue manage to give Gabby away?
she posed as Gabby's mother and gave her to a woman who claimed she knew how to deal with troubled kids.
I want my mommy.
hush, Carly.
my name is Gabby.
Garcia, we're out of time. We need something.
OK. There are 3 families who responded to Sue's post.
do any of them own a dark van?
there's a Nicole Jones.
she owns a blue '03 Caravan.
she lives in a shack 20 miles south of where you are off of Interstate 59.
let's go.
clear!
clear!
guys!
d-don't shoot me.
Where's Gabby Hoffer?
she's gone.
she's still not talking.
she must have panicked and gotten rid of Gabby.
Garcia, who else from the area answered Sue's post?
uh...there's one woman, Michelle Fader.
she ran in the same sick circles.
and she owns an old van.
this Fader's a real winner.
she was evicted from her last known address.
they probably won't risk going back towards the abduction site, which means they're headed southwest.
let's go.
OK. The woman I hope you're about to arrest had all of her biological kids taken from her 5 years ago because another child died while in her custody.
she was never charged?
Oh, no, she was, but for neglect.
she didn't spend a minute in jail.
social workers haven't come by her house at all because none of her kids are in her custody.
and they have no idea she's been finding new children online.
those poor little darlings are being treated like trash.
they don't know that anybody cares. We care. We care.
Garcia, widen your search to any know male associates of Michelle Fader.
Yeah, will do.
Ohh. I got a picture of Fader with some guy who could win sleaze of the century award.
he's got his arm all possessively around this sweet little girl.
run facial recognition software and get an I. D. on him.
OK, I got a match. Michael Feehan.
he is the perv in the picture with Fader.
he's not in any registries, but he has got a list of accusations.
none of them were proven because all of the victims were too young.
Garcia, did you get the address?
running it now.
please, give me a reason.
what the hell's goin' on?!
Michelle Fader, you're under arrest for staging a child abduction.
I didn't do nothin'. Look, I was trying to help that girl.
you have the right to remain silent.
I am only trying to help that girl.
she wanted a fresh start.
anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
she couldn't take care of her own babies anymore.
you have a right to an attorney...
I am trying to help that girl!
what's gonna happen to my babies?
I've got Gabby.
and there are other kids back here.
are you ok?
can you take me home now?
Yes, sweetheart.
OK, come on.
up you go.
mama!
Oh, my sweet baby!
I missed you, mama.
I missed you so much.
are you sad?
I'm not sad.
so those are happy tears?
Yep.
we're never, ever gonna leave you.
JJ...You ok?
they don't have anyplace safe to be.
it's not ideal, but they'll be in foster care until they find a family.
Yeah, but how many more kids like that are out there?
that's a good question.
Hey, sweetness, thought you might want to see something.
what?
Mmm, mmm, we're gonna go home now and you can...
have a good meal.
Oh, ho ho ho. I needed that.

just tell me what the doctor wants.
I'll do anything.
it's too late for that.
Las VEGAS, NEVADA
no rush, hon. Take your time.
all right, dear.
is the, uh, is the manager in? I was just hoping to get a job application.
honey, that's the third time you've been in this week.
I'm sorry, he's not hiring.
uh, try down at the Nugget. I think they're looking for someone.
they're not.
Oh! Sorry. Excuse me.
what are you gonna do? Times are tough for everyone.
tell me about it. I'm barely getting one booking a month.
well, if Frida doesn't show up soon, Ed can fire her and hire the kid.
there you go. Thanks, dear.
if you want to lift someone's wallet, don't kiss the dog.
what? Don't let him see your face.

what do you know about it?

cigarette?
you know my name.
what's yours?
when's the last time you've slept without keeping one eye open, Finn?
what's it matter to you? It doesn't, really.
I've seen you milling around. Maybe I could help.
look, man, I don't care what you pay.
I don't sleep with dudes.
believe me, if I were gonna pay for that,I wouldn't pick you.
so, um, why do you want to help me?
you remind me of someone.
Ah, gotcha. I remind you of you when you were young and just starting out or some crap like that, right?
word of advice, Finn.
if someone offers to help you...
don't step on him before you know the terms.
have a nice life.
Hey, Marvin!
you, um...
you want your lighter back?
coming SOON CUSTOM HOMES
Hey, there's something over here.
Oh, my God.
the bodies of two unidentified women were found in the desert just outside of the good doctor's hometown, Las Vegas.
they were stripped of their I. D.
one looks like she was killed yesterday, the other a couple of weeks ago.
according to the M. E. report, both women were in their 30s, and
is this cause of death right?
Yes, and I have confirmed it. Both women drowned.
how far is the nearest body of water? The Hoover Dam, Lake Mead, like 60 miles.
so we're looking at a disposal site. Were they sexually assaulted?
no, but they did both suffer blunt force trauma and severe antemortem abrasions to the wrists and ankles.
that means they were most likely held somewhere before they were killed.
or maybe they were bound so they could be tortured With water. - She's right.
we can't rule out waterboarding or being held underwater in a pool or a bathtub, it's possible this unsub's a sadist.
the woman killed yesterday was wearing a uniform. She could have been a waitress or a maid.
there are 93 hotels in Las Vegas, 260 motels and inns, 1, 510 bars, and 2, 996 restaurants.
not to mention nearby Summerlin, which is growing in popularity.
well, local P. D. has ruled out the major establishments.
they're combing through the smaller ones now to see if they can find a match.
the other Jane Doe was pretty decomposed.
clothing looks ordinary. Is that a fanny pack she's wearing?
Yes, and it was empty. It means she was probably a tourist, though.
last year Las Vegas documented 39, 727, 022 visitors.
no other place has better surveillance software.
Garcia, contact Vegas P. D. and ask them to start going through hotel and casino surveillance video from 3 weeks ago, and tell them we'll be there in 4 hours. Let's go.
Yes, sir.
casino
No! Get away from me.
help!
sir, please! Can you hear me, anybody?!
somebody help me! Please! Help!
the secret of my influence has always been that it remained secret.
salvador Dali.
Hi, mom, it's me again.
I'm on a plane to Las Vegas, and I can't wait to see you.
you know, I've been thinking, it's been a really long time since I've had chicken fried lobster, so I was hoping maybe when the case is done, we can go to Binion's.
um, I have to go. Call me back.
Bye. Love you.
the two women were brunettes in their 30s. The unsub has a type.
if that's the case, were they targeted, or were they victims of opportunity?
there's something strange about the disposal site.
it would seem like he took the bodies into the desert to hide them, but he chose a spot next to an old construction site that's for sale.
he had to imagine that someone would show up eventually. So was he hiding the bodies or displaying them?
it could be both.
he might be hiding them from law enforcement but displaying them to another group.
Hello, American heroes. I just got an I. D. on the most recently deceased victim,Frida Bancroft, 34. She was working as a waitress at Della Rose's grill downtown.
manager said she'd been there for two months, and I just sent you a picture.
did she exhibit unusual behavior recently, or was she involved with anyone suspicious?
well, the manager said he took a chance by hiring her because she's a former drug addict with a spotty work history, and when she didn't show up to work for the last 3 days, he figured she had started using again.
but we know she didn't, because the M. E. report says the tox screen was negative.
JJ, you and Reid go to the disposal site.
Dave and Morgan, go to the diner and find out what you can about the waitress, and Blake and I will go to the Vegas P. D. I can't believe she's dead.
I was joking earlier that Ed I should just fire her. Oh, I feel awful.
don't. You didn't mean anything by it.
were there any recent changes in Frida's life?
no. Other than signing a new apartment lease a week ago.
she'd been saving up all the money she made here for the last couple of months to pay for the security deposit.
it takes a lot of discipline to do that so quickly. What about friends and family?
was she in a relationship? She never talked about her past or her personal life.
it's almost like she wanted the slate clean.
OK, thanks. Thank you.
Frida seemed determined to start a new life for herself, and we know she wasn't using.
she had to be hiding or running away from something.
I agree.
maybe she owed her dealer money and was pulled back into the drug world.
the owners don't like it, but there's not much they can do about it.
bored teenagers party and drink here.
vagrants come out to collect empty beer bottles and cans.
so this location actually gets a lot of visitors.
more than you'd expect in the middle of the desert.
it's probably because this is here. People like to have a landmark to go to.
where exactly were the bodies found? The waitress was about 5 yards from the main sign.
the tourist was 200 yards that way.
this isn't completely dry.
there are drops of paint on the ground. This was done recently.
whoever it was must have seen the body. It'd be hard to miss here.
it was probably some kid too scared to report it. 2/10 could be a tagger name or a gang sign.
does it look familiar to you? No.
2 out of 10. It's possible the unsub wrote this.
there were two victims here. Which means there could be 8 more.
he might be operating off a hit list.
you're not local. What are you doing in Vegas?
just looking for a girl.
my sister. She moved here a while ago and no one's heard from her in a year.
what kind of trouble are you in? I'm not.
don't lie to me, Finn. Ok, ok.
what did you do? I got into a bar fight, ok?
I beat up a guy pretty bad and it turns out his brother was a cop.
I'll help you, but you gotta be truthful.
the one thing I can't abide are lies.
you're giving me tips on stealing and you can't abide lies?
this isn't about ethics. It's about a relationship.
if I invite you into my world, it's because I trust you, and you can trust me.
among thieves? You got an innocent face.
that's worth a lot.
and you got grift sense. It just needs to be honed.
I'm helping you because you can help me.Those are the terms.
Hey, we've been walking forever.
where is your place? Right here.
toss me your bag.
you live down here? For now, until my plan works out.
how long you been here? A couple years.
most of these folks have been living here longer.
this is Mary. Terrific steer.
she chooses the targets. Gladys is the stall.
and Olsen is a damn good wire.The guy who actually lifts the goods.
so you all steal together. Sometimes.
home sweet home.
you can stay next door.
this was Frida's place， She moved out.
the doctor wanted this cleaned up.
actually, I was hoping my friend could use it, Cesar. This is Finn.
I'm vouching for him.
OK, then. Welcome to Paradise.
these tunnels used to be dangerous.
about a year ago, Cesar cleaned up this whole section.
how?
by establishing some much needed order.
why'd you have to vouch for me? Every good system needs its rules.
the first rule is, you don't join us unless someone vouches for you.
he said the doctor wanted this cleaned up.
who's that?
the Doctor is someone Cesar works for.
no one's ever met him, though.
Cesar's a little off, but we let him go considering all the good he's done.
just don't cross him.
this is from 16 days ago.
you can see she's wearing the same clothing as the first victim.
Yeah, it's definitely her. Casino I. D.'D her as Renee Sheffield of Omaha.
she applied for a job 3 years ago as a hostess but didn't make the cut.
there's no known address for her. Any I. D. on the boyfriend or husband who's with her?
there's no hits on the facial recognition system.
does anyone at the casino remember seeing or talking to them in person?
good luck with that. They get thousands of guests a week.
hold on. Can you rewind that about 5 seconds?
take a look at Renee.
she's stealing. She's a strip-miner.
I can't believe I missed that.
strip-miners take money or chips left behind or unwatched by careless tourists.
they dress to look like tourists themselves so that they're not spotted by casino security.
so the fanny pack is a prop. How many strip-miners are there?
hard to say， Hundreds at least.
there's no shortage of desperate people here. A lot of grifters work in teams.
it's possible the man with her is just a partner.
maybe the partnership went bad and he killed her.
the dead waitress could be part of the team as well if they all stole together.
we need to get an I. D. on the man. Please tell your team that's our top priority.
pay attention tonight，I'm gonna teach you a few things.
the first is called a pattern interrupt.
the brain has learned certain actions like shaking hands or tying a shoe as one single motion.
if you interrupt it in the middle, the brain can't pick up where it left off.
it's a moment where suggestion can enter.
good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Marvin Caul.
many of you may know me as the master of deception with the power of suggestion.
and what is your name, sir?
Hey, Dale, check it out.，I'm getting hypnotized.
a pleasure to meet you, Bill.
close your eyes and sleep.
focus on the sound of my voice.
when I snap my fingers, you're gonna open your eyes and forget about the number 4.
the number 4 will no longer exist.
can you see me, Bill? Yeah.
just to be sure, how many fingers am I holding up? Count them for me.
I don't get it. It's ok, Bill.
now, close your eyes again.
when I clap my hands, you're going to wake up and everything will be back to normal.
what's going on?
how many fingers? 4.
excellent.
you were terrific, Bill.
OK, now, who's next?
ladies and gentlemen, the one, the only, Romeo...
that was great, man.
that handshake thing, that was incredible.
she's amazing, right?
yet, everyday, we witness...
the impossible.
I can't believe that Romeo's doing a private party. My sister thinks he's a genius.
she applied for a job as his assistant. He's a cocky little punk.
cesar worked security for him once.
he's no genius. Now, I'll need a volunteer.
he just got lucky.
OK, well, thank you.
what's wrong? My mom's not even here.
her psychiatrist said that she's doing really well on some new medication, so she decided to go on a supervised field trip to the Grand Canyon.
that's great. Isn't it?
no, it is great. It's just...
I guess I kinda of can't believe that she didn't tell me about it, you know?
this is someone that used to literally write me a letter daily at one point.
I see.，You think she forgot about you?
Spence, you should be happy. This means she's getting better.
she's not constantly checking in. You're right, I know.
grifters, hustlers, scammers， call them what you will.
this town has always been a mecca for con artists.
Yeah, but nobody comes here with the intent of being a strip-miner.
it's just people with bigger dreams that didn't pan out.
Hey, baby girl, what you got, mama? Props to the Federal B. I.
our next generation database is usually a miss, but today I got a big hit. I've I. D.'d our mystery man.
his name is Elijah Hall, and 10 years ago Elijah served time in San Diego for assault and possession of PCP.
any connection to Renee Sheffield? No, not that I can see.
when did he move to Las Vegas? 7 years ago.
I don't have a current address yet, but fret not, my chickens, as soon as I do, I will hit you back.
do your thing.
Frida kind of reminds me of my sister.
I wonder if Romeo knows anything about Carrie.
do you know how to get in touch with him?
why would I be in contact with that fraud?
OK.
sorry I asked.
Frida sure left a lot of her personal stuff behind.
she didn't want any reminders of the tunnels.
it was temporary for her, just like it is for me.
I could blow all my money on rent or I could save it up like I'm doing and use if for my plan.
what exactly is your plan?
I'm going to book a stage at the Rio. Headline a performance.
once a real audience sees what I can do, I'll be famous.
I'll get past all the corporate cronies who keep the genuine talent from getting out there.
what was that? I don't know.
cesar will take care of it.
if you'd just admit you've been hiding money...
the doctor will be lenient. I haven't.I swear.
don't do this, Cesar. We're friends.
doctor.
it's you.
I know he's still alive, but I've been waiting for...
I understand.
I'll kill him now.
no. No. Uhh!
the abrasions on Elijah's hands and ankles are like the other victims.
this is a populated area.
we compromised his original disposal site, but this is a far cry from the desert.
it means the unsub's growing bolder.
he's certainly less concerned about concealing his crime. Look at this.
2 out of 10 again.
but this is the third victim that we know about, so it can't be about a hit list.
2 out of 10 isn't a countdown at all. I think he might be referring to a hobo code.
from the great depression.
exactly. It means two eyes on 10 fingers because thieves are present.
the code was devised during the Great Depression by hobos to help each other out.
by placing the codes near the victims, who's being helped?
no one. It's a threat. If you steal, this is what will happen to you.
we're ready to give the profile.
we're looking for a sociopath who is taking revenge on people he believes stole from him.
none of the victims had a documented address, so it's likely they were homeless.
they may have known each other from the street or from a shelter.
the disposal site of the first two victims served a dual purpose.
it was meant to hide the bodies from law enforcement but at the same time put them on display for the people that the message was intended for.
all of this suggests a group or organization at work, but it doesn't have the hallmarks of organized crime.
the victims seen on surveillance video weren't stealing large sums of money, so we're dealing with a much smaller community.
but this group operates by a strict code, and any violation of that code can result in death.
you should be on the lookout for groups that operate robberies and cons together.
the group has a strong leader who does not tolerate dissent.
this leader appears normal and comfortable in social situations.
he may even be extroverted and charismatic like a cult leader.
he'll have grandiose delusions and believe that he is special.
he may even believe that he can communicate with God or some other higher powers.
he will attempt to surround himself with people who are subservient, either sycophantic followers or people who are trapped by financial constraints.
how's he recruiting these people?
it's likely he attracts followers by offering some assistance.
but as his power grows, so will his narcissism.
he'll begin to make increasingly extreme demands.
he'll want more attention, which could be why his latest victim was found in a very public place.
with the choice of this latest disposal site, it indicates that he's growing bolder and more careless.
he has lost 3 followers. He's gonna need new recruits.
so we should step up patrols in areas where the homeless population gathers.
thank you.
I used to have 10, well, maybe 15 cats at one point.
now all I got is noodle. His mom was nipsey.
uh, have you seen Marvin?
Marvin? No, not since last night.
what's going on?
it's tax day. I gotta go.
45. Very good, Gladys.
I'll be sure and tell the doctor.
12 dollars.
is that it?
Yeah, that's all, Cesar. You sure about that?
Cesar, I swear.
because someone with the initials Mary Carter told me you cleaned up at the Luxor Friday night.
Oh, no, that's not true. You know, I'd really hate to tell the doctor about any of this.
you know how he gets.
you remember what happened to Frida, Renee, and Elijah?
that's because they tried to leave.
without paying their taxes. That makes them thieves.
but I sure do miss them.
here, take it all. Go ahead.
doctor only wants his fair share.
who are you? Uh, my name is Sarah.
someone invite you? No. I'm new.
I just need a place to stay for a while until I can buy a bus ticket back home to Minnesota.
can anyone vouch for you?
look, if no one can vouch for you-- I can.
I know her.
all right.
tax day's over.
well, other than gender, one other thing's different about this victim.
these fresh abrasion marks on the neck. Strangulation?
that's your cause of death. No sign of drowning here.
drowning his victims was a unique signature. Why change it now?
maybe he didn't have the time or means to drown him, or the unsub could be devolving.
the diatom results are back on the water in the lungs of the first two victims.
this is interesting.
1, 900 milligrams of lead, 320 milligrams of...
do you mind if I just take a peek at this? It'll be quicker.
this isn't drinking water. It's contaminated with ground pollutants.
it's like storm-water runoff. So the unsub killed him in a gutter?
my guess would be the floodwater control tunnels beneath the city.
thanks for saying you know me.
Yeah, no problem. I'm, uh, I'm new here, too.
so, who vouched for you?
this guy Marvin. He actually lives right there.
he's really cool. He's been, uh, helping me out.
so, what's up with Cesar? Is he some kind of enforcer?
uh, I guess so.
he apparently is a little psycho, but I
Oh, hey, Marvin. Here you are.
I was wondering where you were. Who's your friend?
Oh, uh, this is Sarah. She's new down here.
I'm just here until I can get a bus ticket back home to Minnesota.
you're rather put together for a girl who needs a bus ticket back home to Minnesota.
I was staying at a friend's apartment, but then I got kicked out.
well, that is unfortunate. Here, this is for you.
I found it in a used bookstore.
this is fantastic. Thanks, man.
Marvin, he's a magician. Show her something.
well, let me think. Um...
if I may.
I could hypnotize her, but part of successful hypnosis is knowing who's susceptible.
people who can shut out reality.
who get sidetracked by a sunset.
who lose track of time, are good candidates.
those who aren't tend to be judgmental, fastidious, and...
less trusting of others. Which I think describes Sarah.
so perhaps I'll just lift her watch instead.
there are at least 1, 500 people who live in the flood control tunnels.
it's a crossroads of the destitute-- ex-cons, drug addicts, hard-core gamblers.
plus there's always the threat that the tunnels will flood like they did last week when there was a flash thunderstorm in the desert.
we try to warn the residents to evacuate, but there isn't always time.
some of the tunnels will flood when there's just a 15-minute storm up in the mountains.
so if the unsub knew about a coming storm, he could have just tied up the victims and left them in the tunnel to drown.
then afterwards he just took the bodies to the desert to dump them.
with the third victim, it hadn't rained in the last 24 hours, so he had to just strangle them.
Frida Bancroft was a former drug addict. Renee and Elijah were both strip-miners.
it's more than likely they were all residents underground.
so we need to start searching these tunnels.
that's the tricky part. There are 413 miles of them.
it's unbelievable. It's gonna make a great story.
OK. I gotta go， I'll talk to you later.
you going somewhere? Oh! You scared the bejesus out of me.
I was just heading out to go get some things I left at the bus station in a locker.
anything I can do to help?
no, I'm good. Thanks.
you've all been very nice. All right, then.
have a good night.
you, too.
based on where the victims were last seen alive, plus the most accessible locations in the tunnels,
I've narrowed down the two most likely sections they stayed in. They're 22 miles apart.
just got a call about a missing person.
a journalist for the "Las Vegas Chronicle" by the name of Sarah Renfield.
do you think this is connected to our case?
she's been working on a story about the homeless people in the tunnels.
has anyone tried tracking her cell phone?
it was found in a dumpster on Beakman Street on the south side of town.
that's right here. Nearest tunnel access point is C-16.
that's 30 miles from our other locations. All right, we should split up.
What'd you find, Garcia?
could someone let the Pope know about me, because what I do is kind of a miracle.
I recovered a text from Renee Sheffield's cell phone sent 6 months ago before her service was cut off.
it reads, "Met E in tunnel. Great guy.
planning to leave together soon.
any chance "E" stands for Elijah Hall?
in my limited research about the tunnels, it appears that people meet and fall in love there.
I've heard about entire families that live down there.
so in addition of being accused of stealing, it seems all 3 victims wanted to move out of the tunnels.
well, Frida the waitress had just left.
if Renee and Elijah were about to do the same, that could have tr the unsub's rage.
you can't have a cult if everyone tries to leave.
who knew living in the tunnels came at such a high price?
Hey, uh, have you seen Sarah, the new girl?
OK, thanks.
Hey. Um, I was looking for Sarah, and I
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
what happened to her?
she's a reporter. She was gonna write about us, which would not be a good thing.
so you killed her?
she's not dead. Yet.
back away! Hey, what's going on?
he's crazy, man. She's a reporter.
he hurt Sarah. The water's over the bridge!
what does that even mean?! The Doctor knows!
can we all just calm down? Everyone wants to do what's best.
since Finn vouched for her, perhaps he should be the one to handle this.
we're at a locked entrance. No one's been here in a long time.
copy that.
remind me to call my shoemaker. I'm gonna need a new pair of boots.
you have a shoemaker? Well, one thing I've learned in life
a good pair of shoes can last longer than a marriage.
you only have to pay for them once.
sir, we're with the FBI.
we're looking for information on these people.
do you recognize any of them?
no, I don't.
are you afraid of something?
whoever it is, we'll protect you.
Cesar's a very bad man.
where can we find him?
FBI! We just want to talk.
go! Go, go, go!
JJ, go left.
drop it!
keep your hands where I can see them and get down on your knees.
where is Sarah?
the police are still looking, but there's no sign of her.
Cesar, we have a witness who says you killed these people.
did you murder Sarah, too?
the water's over the bridge.
what does that mean? The Doctor knows.
is that someone who lives in the tunnels, too?
he's more than someone. Dr. Aja Mesbi is a magic man.
magic man?
Yeah, he's like a sorcerer.
he's got powers.
what sort of powers?
he controls words, thoughts.
he can do whatever
he can do whatever he wants in you just by thinking it.
if he's not delusional and this is an act, he's quite good.
the water is over the bridge.
it could be the opposite of water under the bridge.
it would mean something's not forgiven, which is consistent with revenge as a motive.
the drowning of the first two victims could be symbolic of that. Go ahead, Garcia.
coming at you with the skinny on Cesar Jones.
he's an ex-con who served time 8 years ago for armed robbery.
according to prison incident reports, he is known for his volatile temper and extreme brutality.
any history of mental illness? Any psychotic or delusional disorders?
I am not finding it. I think he's just an angry person.
OK. Thanks.
I don't think Cesar could have pulled off all these murders or the kidnapping of the reporter.
it would take patience, planning, and organization.
he doesn't have the concentration skill set.
pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
"the Wizard of Oz"? The Doctor could be real.
cesar would be the kind of person vulnerable to manipulation.
and Dr. Aja Mesbi
that's an odd name.
it sounds vaguely African or Indian.
or made up.
it's an anagram, for James Braid.
he was a Scottish surgeon in the 1800s, considered to be the father of hypnosis.
let me try something. Cesar's a lunatic.
I'm pretty sure he killed Frida and some other people, too.
where are we? Above ground, like you wanted.
Yeah, but we're in the middle of the desert. We were supposed to bring her to the hospital.
it's easy to get lost in the tunnels.
Cesar, hi.
my name is Dr. Spencer Reid, and I'm an FBI agent.
but, really, I work for Dr. Mesbi.
he sent me here to help you.
how do I know you're telling the truth?
I'll turn the camera off.
I think you know the Doctor's very powerful, and you can imagine he has many people in many places to help him.
do you believe that?
Finn, I know you care about this girl.
you're smart and you're able to think ahead, so you can imagine what will happen when she wakes up, tied up, with us here.
she'll think we did it. No, no, we'll explain to her how we rescued her
and she won't believe it. No one would.
play it out. I don't know, man.
if she goes to the police, all of us in the tunnels will be arrested, including you.
she will ruin a very good thing for a lot of people.
what am I supposed to do? You already know the answer, Finn.
she cannot live.
you have to kill her.
the Doctor values you, Cesar. He trusts you, and you know that.
you're very important and we need to get you out of here, but in order for me to help you,
I need to know about the last conversation you had with the Doctor.
I can't remember it.
I'm going to help you try to remember, ok?
do me a favor and close your eyes.
imagine you're back in the tunnels.
it's chilly. The air smells damp.
do you see anything? Don't do this.
I see Elijah. He's begging for his life.
I hear the Doctor and I go to him.
doctor.
what happens next? He's
I'll kill him now.
the reporter's still alive. The Doctor's real name is Marvin Caul.
he and someone named Finn Bailey took her into one of the tunnels heading into the desert.
how'd you get him to talk? Neuro-linguistic programming.
I used sensory predicates and key words to tap into his unconscious mind.
Marvin Caul must have done the exact same thing. You've lost me.
nlp is a way of thinking and communicating based on linguistic modeling.
for example, key words like know and imagine open someone up to suggestion.
it's behind a lot of persuasion and sales techniques.
there are two different exits into the desert.
one on the north end and the other's on the west.
all right, let's go. What have you got, Garcia?
Marvin Caul, known as the master of deception.
he's a low-level entertainer who performs at private parties.
he hasn't filed a tax return in 5 years. The IRS is after him.
no known address. He does have a P. O. Box.
no tax returns?
he's either not doing so well or doing really well.
I'd guess the former.
someone who feels trivial in the regular world would look for power elsewhere.
well, the homeless would be an easy population for him to exploit and give him a sense of importance.
what did you find out about Finn Bailey?
Finn Bailey, 26. He was picked up in Reno two months ago for shoplifting.
according to the police reports, he was on his way to Vegas to look for his sister Carrie.
she was about to start a job with a magician named Romeo, but the day before she was supposed to start, she called her brother, sounding scared and babbling about some doctor.
that was the last he heard from her. Did the Reno police follow up?
no, because there was no proof that Carrie was actually missing.
well, we know Marvin's enraged by people trying to leave.
what if Carrie was the original trigger? That means she's probably dead.
you know what has to be done, Finn.
where did you get that?
I stole it from the cab of a semi last month.
before I do this, I want to know something.
the whole time I was in the tunnel, you're the only one that didn't seem scared of Cesar.
and you were gone on tax day.
what's this about, Finn? My sister told me all about you.
how you liked to eat at Della Rosa's grill, how you met her there and brought her down to the tunnels.
you killed her, didn't you?!
she said if anything ever happened to her, the Doctor was responsible.
you're the doctor, aren't you? FBI! Drop your weapon!
not until he tells me what he did to my sister.
you're mistaken, Finn. I never met her.
liar! Put the gun down! He told me to kill Sarah, too.
the boy's quite mad. Finn, let us go to Sarah.
she needs our help. Will you let us do that?
copy that.
the police just confirmed your sister's dead, Finn. I'm sorry.
because you killed her.
she was found in a crack den. She died of an overdose.
no, no, no.
he convinced her to do it. He's very persuasive.
it was in Phoenix, Finn. Is man had nothing to do with it.
you have the wrong guy. Put the gun down.
there's no point to this.
thank God you showed up.
Marvin Caul, can I just that say I'm a huge fan.
I saw you perform at the Lotus Inn back in 1977
when I was a little kid and I always wondered what happened to you.
time. Time has not been kind.
here, let me give you a ride back to the station.
I can't imagine how hard it must have been for someone of your talent to stay hidden for so long.
I mean, weren't you dying to get back out there?
of course. And I have a plan.
I am going to book a stage at the Rio.
so, that's what the money was for.
you know, I have to say, it's absolutely brilliant.
you found the perfect population to steal from and someone else to do your dirty work.
I tip my hat to you. I have no idea what you're saying.
what I'm saying is that you're going to be charged with murder, and the first one will be Carrie's.
I'm assuming you killed her because your ego got in the way when she left you to work for another magician. Am I right?
look, Marvin, there's no place to go.
you're a very clever man and you know how to read a situation.
tell me where Carrie's body is and at least you'll get recognition for what you accomplished in the tunnels.
she's buried at the abandoned construction site.
did you really see me at the Lotus Inn?
the truth? I can't abide lies.
I wasn't even born yet.
illusion is needed to disguise the emptiness within.
Arthur Erickson.
I'm sorry you didn't get to see your mom. It's ok.
I guess now I know what a parent feels like when their kid grows up.
someone who's depended on you for so long and then suddenly they're off living their own life and they don't really need you anymore.
except she's the parent, and that's how it should be.
Oh, hi. Welcome back.
this came for you. No return address?
Yeah, and it's really heavy. So what's inside it?
Yes, that's me being nosy.
that looks like a pile of-- shale, limestone, and sandstone.
it's a sculpture of the Grand Canyon from my mom.
see? She didn't forget you.
she said she was gonna mail the postcards, but then she decided to send the Grand Canyon instead.
here, listen to this.
you many have to commit me twice, Spencer, "because not only did I ride a mule on a tiny trail "with a 1, 000-foot vertical drop, "I paid for the privilege.
now, that's crazy.
can you imagine my mom on a mule? No.
it's like Hotch at the beach.
the mules must do this all the time, because the seem very...
this is such bull.
he's the one who ought to be arrested, not me.
I thought you girls were paid up front before the lap dance.
this guy looked good for it. - So he got his lap dance
Yeah, two of them. Good ones.
and then he paid you with postage stamps.
he said, "it's the same as money.
Really? Try paying rent with that.
that still doesn't mean you can kick a man in his private parts, Candy. That's assault.
Hey! Watch it!
you want to go? - I got an emergency. I got an emergency.
listen. Listen.
look, you gotta help me. Somebody's trying to kill me.
yeah? Who's trying to kill you?
OK. Hey
I got this.
there. Look at that.
right there.
look at it. See that?
you have less than a day to live. There is no way to prevent the inevitable.
I found that in my mailbox out of the blue. I'm not crazy.
how much have you had to drink tonight, sir? I can smell alcohol.
what are you talking about? It's not important.
look, um...I'm sorry. Just...
can I stay here, uh, tonight, just until the morning?
this isn't a motel.
just go back home, calm down, try to get some sleep.
mission accomplished, pal. You're in for the night.
heard some whacked-out helped empty the garbage last night.
you heard right. Word is this guy wanted to be arrested?
Yeah, now he's gotta go see the judge.
would've been cheaper if he'd just gone to a motel.
let's go. Rise and shine.
damn it!
get an ambulance!
as my dear mother used to say, a penny for your thoughts.
Jack asked me to speak to his class about being an FBI agent.
they're having career day. Sounds like fun.
come on. Every day you strap on the six-shooter and go after the bad guys. The kids'll love it.
Oh, I know. And I'm glad he asked.
it just, I'm a little worried about it because I don't want it to end up being difficult for him.
because of what happened to Hailey.
one of the bad guys killed his mom.
and he's doing fine. And we talk about it some, but I just don't want this to end up...hurting him.
you're a good dad, Aaron.
and I know you're doing everything you can to help him.
and I also know you'll make the right decision about this, whatever it is.
Thanks.
Oh, I'm interrupting. But we're ready.
thank you.
Wayne Campbell, 38 years old, found dying yesterday morning in his holding cell in Long Beach, California.
he claimed someone was trying to kill him, so he purposely got himself arrested to be protected.
a strategy that didn't work out so great.
what is the C. O.D? Arsenic poisoning.
Ah, an oldie but a goodie.
and you're tuned to the station where the hits keep coming.
when news spread of Campbell's death, an officer in a nearby precinct remembered Helen Mitchell.
6 days earlier, she showed up with this letter she had found in her mailbox a few days before.
was it investigated?
they started a file, but Helen wasn't especially concerned.
and in light of Campbell's death, they exhumed Helen Mitchell's body, and lethal amounts of arsenic were found in her system as well.
handwritten letters, poisoning by arsenic-- we could be looking at a female unsub.
who wants her victims to have foreknowledge of their deaths.
that's a new one.
actually, we've seen a version of this M. O. before.
6 years ago in Dallas, Max Pool warned his victims by putting their faces on missing posters before killing them.
in any event, there may be notes out there that we don't know about.
we've got a long flight. Let's get going.
you can exchange the muffler for equal or greater value.
come on. Can't I exchange it for something cheaper?
my car's got like 200, 000 miles on it.
Yeah, go ahead.
what's so important, man?
I'm on my way to pick up Izzy for school.
wait. You think I did this?
it was under my door when I came in to work this morning.
a death threat? I look like a psycho to you?
this conversation's done.
Hey, man, you ok?
Yeah. Yeah.
look, maybe we had a fight the other day, but you and me, we go back a long time.
close up and go home, huh? Take an aspirin.
quit accusing people of stuff.
Hello? Uh, anybody back here?
I found the muffler I want.
a proverb states, "he that is born to be hanged shall never be drowned.
Helen Mitchell was the socially prominent widow of an investment banker, philanthropist, patroness of the arts.
Wayne Campbell, on the other hand, was as blue collar as they come.
worked for a tree-trimming and removal company.
Garcia, was the M. E. able to estimate when Campbell might have ingested the arsenic.
somewhere between 6: 00 and 10 p. m. last evening.
do we know where Campbell was during those hours?
same place he is every Tuesday night while his wife plays bridge.
Erish grill. It's a neighborhood sports bar.
this isn't widely known, but Helen Mitchell had a drinking problem, and Wayne Campbell abused painkillers.
that could be the common thread, and unsub's punishing them for their vices?
poisoning those who poison themselves? The syntax of the note is interesting.
instead of a simple "stop it," you get "prevent the inevitable.
and in block lettering to disguise the handwriting.
Oh, no. Make room in your files, they're about to get thicker.
a third victim was just reported half an hour ago.
Carlos Ortega. Exact same note left on his body.
also poisoned? - Yeah, it looks that way.
well, this is weird.
there was a piece of twine on his chest.
no twine was reported on or near the first two victims.
less than a day between kills this time. He's accelerating.
Morgan, see who Helen Mitchell had contact with in the 24 hours before she died.
Dave, you and Blake check out the Carlos Ortega crime scene.
JJ and Reid to the sports bar, and I'll coordinate with local law enforcement.
are you the responding officer?
Yes, sir. Delivery driver discovered the body.
blood, vomit, evidence of hyper-salivation.
smelled garlic on the victim. Maybe somebody spiked his food?
garlic odor in the breath and body tissue is a common indicator of arsenic poisoning.
Yeah, I wonder how the unsub got him to ingest it.
is that the twine found on his chest? That's correct.
laid out real precise, in a straight line, pointing head to toe.
detective Tavez. SSA Hotchner.
glad you're here.
we have our share of homicides, but this is something new.
did you check with other precincts for similar cases?
Yes. Nothing so far.
thank you very much. Hey, Hotch.
Helen Mitchell's personal secretary.
she claims that Helen was home alone the day of her death.
the only thing out of the ordinary was a small box of chocolates delivered to the house.
do we know who sent them?
supposedly a local charity to thank her for hosting a fund-raiser.
except the charity claims they know nothing about it.
any chocolates missing from the box? - 3.
Campbell's personal belongings you asked for. Thank you.
do you remember what Mr. Campbell ate the night before last?
his usual. Chili dog, onion rings. Cast-iron stomach, that guy.
did he talk to anyone? Just the guy sitting next to him.
was this other guy also a regular?
no. I hadn't seen him before.
he kept buying Wayne drinks, though.
can you describe him? White guy, heavy-set, maybe 40 years old.
wore a hat, average-looking.
do you think you'd recognize him if you saw him again?
Yeah, I think so. Ok, well, thank you for your help.
we may be contacting you again. Anything I can do to help.
look, Wayne seemed a little preoccupied that night, but he was a good guy.
the unsub may have spiked his drink.
it wouldn't have been hard to do.
a busy bar, lots of noise and distraction. Get another double vodka.
he kept plying Campbell with booze to get him drunk.
I'm gonna go to the head. I appreciate it.
and since what goes in has to eventually come out, it'd be his way to ensure that he'd get up at some point to use the bathroom.
the victim left momentarily...
the unsub slipped in the arsenic...
and left the bar.
and when Campbell returned from the bathroom...
he took a drink.
he never had a clue.
Oh! Holy cow!
all right, Bill. Last chance, buddy.
you sure you want to leave all this splendor for some lousy island in the Mediterranean?
you know, Bill almost jumped the gun and went 20 years ago.
had his ticket bought for Greece and everything.
except, me and him went out and tied one on the night before, and Bill missed the shuttle van to the airport.
and I could never look a Mai Tai in the face again.
hurry it up, Wick. I don't like room temperature champagne.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But here's to your new life, Bill.
Yeah! Congratulations, bill.
just remember to keep an extra hammock strung up on the beach for your old buddy Wick, huh?
come on, speech. Come on.
speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech...
um, I...
I was just thinking about how all of this was here before...
and then how it's all gonna be here after.
you know, 'cause...
when they're living like-- - You know, I think
I think Bill's given up on English already and is already talking Greek.
come on up, guys, get some cake.
same kind of twine found in Wayne Campbell's pocket.
a friend of the victim's, Benjie Ruiz, came by the shop around 9: 40
and saw a single customer milling around in the muffler section.
there was no surveillance camera, but a cash register receipt confirms somebody exchanged a muffler at 9: 36.
when Mr. Ruiz left 5 minutes later, the customer was still there.
at 9: 50, Carlos was found dead. No customer in sight.
do we have a description of him?
white male in his 40s, large build, and he wore a hat.
that's the same description the bartender gave to me and JJ.
it's gotta be our guy.
a green car was parked outside when Benjie Ruiz arrived and was still there when he left.
no make or model, but pretty old.
according to Mr. Ruiz, Carlos had no drug or alcohol issues.
he was a solid, hard-working family man.
well, that puts a dent in our theory of an unsub punishing people for their indiscretions.
unless Carlos had a vice we don't know about.
we just confirmed that the chocolates and the water cooler both tested positive for arsenic.
any twine found at Helen Mitchell's house? - A couple feet of it were tossed in the kitchen trash.
we're thinking the chocolates may have been wrapped in it.
guys, I did a geographic profile of the victims, and it turns out they all lived or worked in the same 2. 65 square-mile radius in the north part of the city.
well, that gives us his hunting ground, but not his victim selection criteria.
the bartender said the unsub may have struck up a conversation with Campbell there that night.
that's ballsy.
the same way he walked into Carlos' store to exchange the muffler.
and for some reason, he feels the need to interact with his victims in the hours before they die.
911. What's your emergency? It's not an emergency, really.
I just want to file a complaint against some kids in the neighborhood.
hold on, ma'am. I'm transferring you.
OK.
Uh-huh. These kids are how old?
and can you tell me the nature of the note? Can you read it to me?
ma'am, do not hang up. I'm getting someone from the FBI.
FBI? I don't need that. It's only some kids.
agent Rossi, we have another person with a note.
a Janice Cheswick.
ma'am, this is agent David Rossi.
are you alone in your house?
Yes. I mean, I-- I think so.
double check that all your doors and windows are secured.
stay calm, and do not hang up your phone.
my God.
everything is locked. Now what?
all right. Police have been dispatched to your home.
do not leave your house. I'm scared!
listen, Janice.
this is very important that you do not eat or drink anything.
I won't.
OK. Everything's gonna be ok.
help is on the way.
help! Janice!
we've got an APB out in the surrounding area for an older green car.
do we know how he got in? Garage door shows signs of forced entry.
probably spiked the wine. And when she called the police instead...
this time he used the twine to strangle her. Overkill.
the unsub was denied what he wanted most, the chance to engage with her before she died.
sharp knife, this level of frenzy.
hopefully this son of a bitch also did some damage to himself.
I'll notify local E. R.s to be on the lookout for hand lacerations.
you all right, Dave?
I told her she'd be ok, Aaron, that she'd be fine.
let's go find this guy.
Hey, kid. Our geo profile just go turned upside down.
our latest victims lives and works a good 10 miles from the unsub's hunting ground.
he's either branching out or we're missing something.
Hey, baby girl, I need you to work that magic of yours.
rub my lamp, release the genie. Our latest victim, Janice Cheswick
track her activities as far back as it takes to find a link between her and our other victims.
as far back as in days or weeks? Months, if necessary.
pushing it, Aladdin, but I'm a go. That's why I love you.
these pieces of twine are all different lengths. Are you just now figuring that out?
I think it's by design.
starting with the first victim, the lengths are 25, 15, 12, and 19 inches.
Yeah, so what? If you convert inches to centimeters, you'll have 64, 38, 31, and 48, the exact ages of all 4 victims.
I think I know what this is about.
the man we're looking for is a highly organized offender, but we don't yet know why or how he's choosing his victims.
these appear to be killings of opportunity, yet he's researched his targets as though they'd been selected carefully and with premeditation.
they run the gamut. Young and old, rich and poor, male and female.
but with all of them, he leaves behind a piece of twine.
why does he do that? What does the twine represent?
in Greek mythology, a person's destiny was in the hands of the 3 fates.
one to spin the thread of life, another to measure the thread, and finally atropos, the one who cut the thread with shears at the moment of death.
we think that's what the twine symbolizes.
he's decided the fate of his victims and then he observes them.
as if assuming the form of a mythological God himself.
we don't know what triggered the spree, but the unsub may have recently suffered a loss and is now lashing out.
if he can't control his own fate, he will control others.
this unsub is also quite meticulous.
he studies his victims in advance to the murders, follows them, learns their habits, even interacts with them.
his need to engage directly with his victims is a compulsion that overrides the risk of being caught.
this compulsion will likely be his downfall and lead to his eventual capture.
the time period between warning his victims and killing them is getting shorter with each murder.
he could be unraveling.
the public needs to be made aware that if they receive a note similar to the ones he's already sent, they need to contact 911 immediately. Thank you.
so sorry, my beautiful creatures, my DMV search yielded nuttin', but I did make progress on another front.
that Janice Cheswick, she lives clear across on the other side of town, right?
well, last week, at 4: 17 in the afternoon on the 23rd, to be precise, she charged a double soy latte at a coffee shop smack dab in the middle of the geo zone of the other 3 victims.
sending this now. It's next to the university.
the unsub may be a part of academia.
all right, Garcia, start with the schools of classics and humanities and work out from there.
check any students or faculty for red flags. A fighting bull like moi looks for nothing else.
I've got a sudden craving for a double soy latte.
let's take a ride.
do you recognize any of these people?
I don't. Sorry.
what's this about? We're investigating a series of murders, and we think the killer may have seen one or more of these victims at this coffee shop.
victims? You mean...
all these people got killed?
excuse me. Is that a pinhole camera?
you secretly videotape your employees?
not the employees, just the cash register area.
Yeah, well, I guess that means the employees. We've got a pilferage problem.
how long has this surveillance been going on?
Uh...5 weeks.
go to 4: 17 p. m. on the 23rd.
that's her.
that's all of them.
the unsub must be just out of camera range. This is the moment he selected all his victims.
it ties in with his idea of fate, that these 4 were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
let's bring in Benjie Ruiz and the bartender and see if they recognize anyone who came in that day as the man they saw.
there's another identification we need to make, and fast.
the next in line.
who is it? - It's me, Wick.
uh, ok, just a minute.
you forgot to turn in your keys.
Heh. Thought I'd swing by and get 'em, before you were on the other side of the world.
I haven't been here in a while. - Yeah.
Sheesh. I love what you've done with the place, though.
Thanks, man. Oh, wow, what did you do to your hand?
Oh, I cut it. Clumsy.
so what's the deal with you and Greece, anyway?
I don't know. Just always made sense to me.
Really?
this makes sense to you? - Yeah.
here.
Thanks.
well, man...
safe travels.
I should've gone.
20 years ago, I should have gone.
you were broke 20 years ago, Bill.
hell, I did you a favor that night.
a favor?
I...got you wasted on purpose.
come on.
you had to have figured that out by now.
like you were about to leave a primo job to go halfway across the world, with no money, no prospects.
then your mom got sick right after that, right?
well, if you'd have gone, you wouldn't have been here to look after her the way you did.
and now you're set, man. You got--you got your healthcare, you got your pension.
you worked hard for that.
you can go do Greece in style now. You've earned it.
how long have they been at it? 2 hours, 11 12 minutes.
Garcia's still combing through university records.
no luck.
the fifth customer paid in cash, so we can't track her.
but an enhanced VidCap of her is being distributed to everyone that worked at the coffee shop the last 6 months.
hopefully someone knows who she is.
at the coffee shop, a couple of guys came in wearing scrubs.
is there a hospital near campus?
Yeah, there's a medical center affiliated with the university.
what if that's why the killer was in the vicinity?
for the hospital, not the university.
we profiled the unsub may have experienced a loss.
what if someone he was close to died or was diagnosed with a serious illness?
except this doesn't feel like a guy who has close friends or a tight-knit family.
what if it's him?
the unsub himself got some bad news.
if they told him he had a terminal illness, it would explain the M. O.
you get thrown a curveball... You throw a curveball back.
do unto others what was done unto you.
let's get Garcia on it. Let's go, guys.
they couldn't identify any of the other customers as the man they saw at the auto shop or sports bar.
the killer is picking his victims in the moment, right? You, you, you, and you.
no advance planning. - That's how it looks.
yet he later stalks each one, learning their habits.
how does he manage to do that if they all scatter after they get their coffee?
parking lot.
he saw them through the window.
waited till they came out one by one and drove away.
took down their license plate numbers.
a little research at the DMV.
none of the coffee shop employees can identify the fifth woman in line.
detective, can you make the surveillance video go any faster?
it'll go any speed you want.
go back to the beginning. I need to watch all 5 weeks in the video.
but that's-- - 525 hours.
Yeah. We don't have time for that.
Reid, tell him what you did this morning for breakfast.
I read "War and Peace." Reread it, actually.
this time in the original Russian. Trust me, detective, there's enough time.
the university was a wash, but the med center may just pay off.
in the last 3 months, 485 patients were diagnosed with terminal illness.
34 of those were white males in their 40s.
8 of those have green cars over 15 years old.
like I said, I'm close. If there was only a way to research who wears hats.
did any of the 8 have reason to be at the hospital on April 23rd?
23rd...
Bingo! William Harding had an appointment with his oncologist, got the bad news.
an address, Garcia. Sending it now.
thank you.
how do you do that? By employing the same principles used in speed reading.
I minimize subvocalization of the images and reduce cognitive load by
wait, wait. Back up the feed.
there.
that's her.
can you push in on her name tag? - Yeah.
Hey. It's 12. 50.
hold on. Let me get my wallet.
there you go. Thank you very much.
Bye.
Bonnie Taylor isn't answering. ID this her home address?
Yeah, but today's her day off, so she's not at work.
detective, send squad cars to this address immediately. Right away.
so much for my diet.
and you're sure you've never seen this man?
uh...I'm positive.
this was in the mailbox outside.
Oh, my God. When was the last time you checked your mailbox?
uh, yesterday, I think. Wait, no, um, the day before.
I--I...
I skip sometimes.
excuse us. Ok.
they haven't found any arsenic yet. We must have gotten here first.
no, he had plenty of time. I don't think Bonnie's his target anymore.
the shift in the M. O. is too dramatic.
the time between leaving the note and the murders was contracting, not expanding, and he made no effort to interact with her.
he could be devolving. It's not a loss of focus, it's a shift in focus.
between the time that Harding left the note and now, a more important target's presented itself.
you must be a glutton for punishment. One day retired and you're back for more.
I thought we could have a drink. A drink.
Ah, I'm liking this new Bill Harding already.
what's the occasion?
I didn't realize until today how you'd gone out of your way for me 20 years ago.
Oh, Bill.
I thought I'd return the favor.
Skol.
Garcia, does Bill Harding have any family in the area? Parents deceased, no siblings.
what about his job? - Uh, worked the cargo bays in a shipyard.
yesterday was his last day, actually. - What type of cancer does he have?
mesothelioma. - Asbestos.
he got it working at the shipyard. His anger might be directed toward someone there.
send Morgan the work address. - Yes, sir.
file SENT
look at you, huh? Going off to live your dream.
and here I am.
I got the wife, kids, a two-damn-car garage.
probably be working on these docks for the rest of my life.
Cheers.
Oh, God, you know, if we ever run out of paint thinner around here, I know what to buy.
does he have any criminal history or mental health issues?
well, he's been on antidepressants most of his life.
but he's got a clean police record.
Oh, my. - What is it?
he was part of a massive police search and rescue when he was 6 years old.
when I was 6, before my folks moved here from Idaho, my best friend Randy and I got lost up in the mountains.
we were on a camping trip with... our parents.
it started snowing and got cold, so we decided to separate to try to find our way back and get help.
Randy never made it. I did.
when they found Randy, he was frozen.
I was in the hospital for a week.
damn, Bill.
why didn't you tell me this before?
people said it was my fault. We shouldn't have split up.
they think that's why Randy died. - Come on.
when I was in the hospital, my first-grade teacher came to visit me.
and she gave me this book.
a kids book on Greek mythology.
I opened it... And there it was.
there what was? - A picture of the Labyrinth.
it looked just like that forest that Randy and I got lost in.
but I escaped. Just like Theseus.
like Theseus.
you know, you're starting to talk a little crazy.
you know that, don't you? - Oh, it's not crazy.
it's fate.
I got out...
and he did not.
read this.
what, is this a joke? - Sorry.
not funny, Bill. - No.
I did more digging, Hotch, and I can tell you where he's gonna be a week from now
flight 906, seat 23A, LAX to Athens, Greece.
get this. Bill Harding also applied for an extended visa to Greece way back in 1994.
did he go?
negative. He reserved a spot with Higgins airport shuttle, didn't show up, plane left without him...
Oh, man, you are not gonna believe this.
I'm dying.
cancer.
the doctor says I have 3 to 6 months to live, but it doesn't matter, because most of me died when I missed that plane.
when I left the doctor's office,
I stopped at a coffee shop...
I couldn't get out.
because there were just all of these people all around, so happy, making plans. They were so damn sure that nothing bad was ever gonna happen to them.
it's fate.
some are chosen and some are not.
what are you gonna do, Bill? Are you gonna kill me with that thing?
no, not this. Poison.
FBI, don't move.
william Harding, you're under arrest for the murders of Helen Mitchell, Wayne Campbell,
Carlos Ortega, and Janice Cheswick.
drop the weapon--now.
I think he poisoned me. We'll get you to a hospital.
but right now you need to drop the weapon.
no. He took 20 years of my life from me.
you got that backwards.
that shuttle bus, it crashed on the way to the airport.
all 5 people were killed. You not getting in that van kept you alive.
now put it down.
a person often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it.
Jean de La Fontaine.
Thanks. Given any more thought to, um, career day?
Jack's third-grade class is descending on the BAU on Monday.
excellent. And is Jack happy about it?
ecstatic. He's very excited.
he's proud of you.
I know.
and I don't want to take that away from him.
the challenging part is coming up with a profiling presentation.
well, after 20 years of facing down killers, rapists, and psychopaths,
SSA Aaron Hotchner may have finally met his match.
I've observed each of you. I've interrogated you.
and none of you claims to have the stapler.
at first I thought it was you.
but then...
I profiled...
that it's really you.
what exactly did you profile? - Well, a few things.
first, Jesse, you wouldn't look at me in the eye.
but you were very fidgety with your hands.
and then when Ms. Garcia dropped her lucky quarter, all 3 of you noticed, but you didn't react at all.
you were too busy keeping a lie straight in your head.
well, this has been a very interesting demonstration, Mr. Hotchner.
thank you, Ms. Springer. Class, let's all give him a big thank-you.
thank you! You're welcome.
sir, may I show them my office?
Absolutely. Everybody go with Ms. Garcia.
come on, you guys. It's like the bat cave.
????
can I be a profiler when I grow up? Sure, honey.
if you get good grades and you work hard and you think you might be good at it, why not?
I'm good at it. Are you?
I did a profile on Ms. Springer. Me?
Yeah. You like Jack's dad.
I'm not sure-- when you talk about your cat, you talk real, real fast, because you really like your cat.
you talked real fast like that today, not like with the other dads.
thanks again, Mr. Hotchner. Thank you for the great time.
you're welcome.
probably had to go feed the cat.
so how did I do? It was cool.
it was cool. So what do you say we celebrate?
Yeah. Hot dogs or hamburgers?
both.
I'm a profiler. I should have seen that coming.
a good friend of mine, sheriff Peter Coleman, down in Briscoe county, Texas, reached out to me about a possible case.
the same unsub killed one John and two prostitutes.
if you can't make sure my bitches are safe, then what good are you?
before he was Justin Mills, he was Gordon Borell, and he was arrested for cutting one of the ladies he employed.
but you said the unsub wanted us to catch him and punish him.
what he really wanted was for us to catch the preacher.
BLAKE: We need to tell him we know he didn't do this.
Oh, preacher, what have you gotten yourself into?
shots fired! Shots fired!
we need a medic now!
there's too much blood!
Hey, you're doing great, all right?
Yeah. You gotta stay right here, ok?
eyes on me. Eyes on me.
Yeah.
no, no. No.
open your eyes.
Hurry!
Hurry!
suspect is down. Repeat, suspect is down.
we got this covered. One of yours is in bad shape.
let's go.
copy that. Two of ours, 3 of theirs. Any casualties?
and what about Reid?
not good. They're taking him to the hospital.
I'll call you back.
all right, Derek, you should go get that looked at.
we'll meet you there.
fastest route to the hospital is Highway 17.
Thanks.
the sound is like a teakettle.
do you hear it?
what?
pressure's dropping.
pulse is thready. Starting large-bore I. V.
agent, you've got to sit back.
you gotta help him, man.
kid, come on, now.
stay with me. I'm right here.
stay with me.
when truth is buried, it grows.
it chokes. It gathers such an explosive force "that on the day it bursts out, it blows up everything with it."Emile Zola.
anything yet?
no.
spence would have read like two books by now.
maybe 3.
it should have been me.
or me or any of us.
no.
he pushed me out of the way.
if he doesn't make it
he'll make it.
he has to.
he's just--he's too young.
Yeah, there's still things for him to do.
you know, he wants kids.
can you imagine Spence as a dad?
that'd be the luckiest kid in the world.
no doubt.
Yeah, it turns out you made it.
we're not the only one that's connected and he knows somebody with plane.
how is he?
still in surgery.
you all can see agent Morgan now.
well, if you don't mind, I'd really like to stay here.
the second you hear anything, call me.
I'll be right back.
how's Reid?
he's still in surgery.
No! What are you doing?
you can bet your ass I'm not gonna just sit around here.
guys, come on, get me out of here.
actually, you are. Just hang on a second.
just until we figure out what's what. Catch me up.
the 3 victims inside were dead before the shooting started.
lividity had set in and there was no blood spatter.
they weren't killed there.
the preacher's car was clean, so there's no way he transported bodies in it.
so you were right. He was being framed. But by whom?
the answer's in the victims.
Belinda Clark and Jesse Moore were both tied to prostitution like the others.
Travis Henson was a regular at the pool hall, but he didn't work there.
see, I don't get why the preacher didn't just come clean with you.
he was a narcissistic sociopath who was cornered, but he still thought that he could get away with it.
once he started shooting, he made his decision.
coming clean was no longer an option.
guys, I don't think he was the first one to shoot.
whoever set him up was there.
that's ballsy. What makes you think that?
because I'm pretty sure that Reid and I heard the first shots fired.
we were all outside of that diner.
anybody got any photos?
Yeah. I downloaded the crime scene photos.
all right, show me coleman.
right here.
Where's my vest? I want to show you something.
all right.
you see these?
that's from a Mac-10.
now look at this.
you see how the impact mushrooms out?
that's from a semi-jacketed hydroshock round.
it makes a high-pitched scream. And I know that I heard it.
that's law enforcement issue.
friendly fire?
the round came from the same direction as the preacher.
OK, I don't know who shot first, but I do know that every victim's connected to the pool hall.
the only one missing is Dinah.
go find her.
what are you doing, Dinah?
come on, Owen.
just let me be.
I'm not stubborn like the preacher.
I won't give you any trouble.
you know I ain't gonna say nothin'.
Oh, I know you better not.
please.
Owen, I won't tell anyone.
I swear.
let's go. Come on.
OK. Ok, ok, ok.
move it.
agent.
how is he?
incredibly lucky. Two millimeters to the right and the bullet would have torn through the carotid artery.
it nicked some smaller vessels, but we've stopped the bleeding.
you can see him now.
Hey, how is he?
great.
OK.
Thanks, Alex.
Bye.
spence is in recovery.
good.
the kid's too smart to die.
probably rerouted the bullets by power of suggestion.
I was scared.
Yeah, I was, too.
well, it looks like she packed a few things before someone forced their way in here.
truck's still out front.
she strike you as the mothering type?
well, if you pay her for it. Why?
she has this framed.
it was in the bottom of her bag, so that probably means it was one of the first things she packed.
it must be very important to her.
Yeah, Hotch. She's gone, but it doesn't look like she went willingly.
no, she didn't.
meet us at the station.
right.
where did you guys find her?
trying to get out of town.
deputy McGregor found her flying down Route 13.
when he pulled her over, she resisted arrest.
I'd like to talk to deputy McGregor.
well, he's back out there. What do you need to know?
what was she driving?
he didn't say. Her truck, I presume. Why?
just curious.
well, it doesn't matter much.
it looks like we got her now.
she's gotta be behind all this.
probably got tired of the preacher controlling her and pulled a power play.
I'm sure you guys have a proper word for that kind of behavior.
devious.
excuse me, folks.
Dinah's truck was still at her place.
we need to talk to her.
happy to do it.
Hi, Dinah.
especially when one of their own gets killed.
they stop asking questions and start to frame the case around their theory.
do you know what they think?
they think that you did all of it, not just the preacher, but the sheriff and all of the girls, too.
but here's the thing.
I don't think you wanted those girls to die.
and you were scared for those girls.
because you were one of them.
weren't you?
Dinah, you can tell me whatever it is you are afraid of.
I will protect you.
you can protect me?
we have federal jurisdiction.
who was the little boy in the picture frame?
he's like 7 years old?
you're wasting your time.
I got nothin' to say to you.
with all due respect, agent, she's here under resisting arrest charges, and my guess is there's a hell of a lot more that'll stick.
see? Tunnel vision.
the thing about tunnels
they can get real dark real fast.
I'm gonna take care of my case now.
so if you don't mind...
OK.
well, she's definitely afraid, but got defiant when Bennett walked in.
you get anything about the kid?
nothing but a look of desperation.
if she has someone to lose, they hold all the cards.
outside.
so Garcia did some digging and it turns out that Travis Henson, the third victim from the diner, was also a confidential informant.
for coleman? - No.
for a decorated deputy named Owen McGregor.
you mean the same deputy who arrested Dinah but didn't stick around to book her?
it explains the hydroshock rounds found in Coleman and why all the victims were afraid.
each one reported "they" were gonna get them.
what if "they" is more than just this Owen McGregor?
what if it's the whole force?
I'm telling you, Coleman was not a dirty cop.
no, but he's only been sheriff for a year.
so he's the outsider. That's what got him killed.
it's a massive body count. What the hell are they protecting?
a way of life? Corruption like this can make a lot of people a lot of money.
and you never met this McGregor?
he'd just finished his 4/40 when we landed.
convenient.
he's back on the clock now.
where would he go?
bad news. That agent's gonna make it.
you need my help?
no.
I'll take care of it.
it'll be so great if he wakes up...
and this is the first thing he sees.
Yeah.
the good doctor will always make him smile.
it'd be really great if he wakes up and we're all--ooh-- staring at him.
so, I'm gonna go stand over here.
what's wrong?
trust no one, my friend.
Why?
corruption.
something this organized needs a strong leader.
we think it's deputy Owen McGregor.
and there's a second-in-command who appears trustworthy but has the access and the skill set to do a lot of damage.
deputy Bennett is presenting as that.
they framed the preacher and Dinah.
she's still alive and terrified.
Rossi: She ran the prostitution ring with the preacher, but she must play a bigger part in the rest of this.
Morgan: She's clearly worth more alive than dead.
for now.
we could offerer something, get her to trust us.
we've seen this before.
we find her kid and maybe she'll talk.
let's see if Garcia can find him.
the rest of us need to figure out who else is involved.
Hey, Garcia.
Hi. I found juice, broth, and jell-o.
super bland, but he needs the calories.
when this comes off, I'm gonna look just like Boris Karloff.
Yeah. A little green makeup and you'll have the best Halloween mask ever.
everybody's fine. Don't worry.
I'm not.
you've got that furrowed brow.
will you look who's still awake.
can you tell her she can go now, please?
I'm ok, Alex. Go help the team.
all right. I'm out of here.
I'm glad you're awake.
thank you.
OK.
juice, broth, or jell-o!
jell-o, my favorite.
you guys were out there a long time.
anything we should know about?
just getting some fresh air.
OK.
bonus points for checking in with Uncle Sam.
at least that part of her life's in order.
she's from around her. Mom lives 10 miles away.
this is weird.
her mom has a first-grader enrolled at Buckingham elementary.
what are the chances a 78-year old has a first-grader?
what's his name? Josh.
I'm sending all the information out.
all right, thanks, Garcia.
eat that.
so Garcia tracked down Dinah's son, who's living close to here, but, um,
I've got eyes all over me, so someone else should go.
how's Dr. Reid?
he's awake. He's gonna be fine.
that's good to hear.
what's wrong?
let's take a car ride. I'll fill you in.
JJ, send us the info.
will do.
we knew Coleman had only been here a year, but get this. He replaced a sheriff who also died.
of what?
allergic reaction to medication.
he was in the hospital recovering from a gunshot wound.
who shot him? Got away.
report says it was a drug raid that ended in automatic gunfire.
who wrote that report?
so the old sheriff realized that his office was corrupt.
they staged a murder. That sounds familiar.
then if the prostitutes witnessed it and threatened to tell, that's what got them killed.
on what date did the sheriff die?
it says here March 20, a year ago.
the same day as the first victim Lucas Wagner.
so Owen's had a whole year to figure out his end game.
it all started on that night.
you need to see if you can get Dinah talking, and you need to find out everything you can about Owen McGregor.
what was that about?
just seeing if she wanted to talk.
a person like Dinah's gotta have some demons.
it's like she was born into bad choices.
hello.
Hey, did you get it?
that's the cop we're looking for.
that way?
affirmative.
he's right there, isn't he?
he's at the nurses station.
Oh, I gotta get back to Reid.
Garcia, get in that room and shut the door.
sorry.
OK, I did that. Now what?
I need you to focus and I need you to listen to me. Can you do that?
Yes, yes, I can do that. I can do that.
is there a wheelchair in the room?
Um...yes.
good. Get Reid in it.
that is not gonna be easy.
then get his patient bag. His gun is in there.
Oh, my God. What?
I need you to get out in that hallway.
OK.
you ok?
Oh, yeah.
relieved.
I thought it was gonna be the worst day.
I was so afraid Reid wasn't going to make it.
Yeah, but he did.
and look at us now.
we're gonna go protect a kid and give his mom another chance.
Yeah. Doesn't get much better.
dirty cops doesn't get much worse.
it's funny about this job, isn't it?
the extremes.
Yeah. Well, it's always been that way.
one of the best days of my career turned out to be one of the worst.
july 16, 1983.
child abduction turned murder.
the guy we nabbed killed 5 boys, and they were cases we had already tracked.
there was such a victory in knowing that we'd stopped him from hurting anyone else.
when I got home, my bags were packed.
Carolyn had had enough.
I had forgotten our anniversary again.
saving lives trumped everything.
so I let ours die.
that's the great balance of life.
always finds a way to knock your legs away.
what the hell?
they're headed to get the kid.
what are you talking about? They figured it out.
I knew I should have handled this myself.
if you can, make your way to the exit.
not the elevator, please.
what do you want us to do?
what's happening? Let's get out.
kill them.
thought you said it doesn't get any worse.
until it does.
are they really gonna shoot federal agents?
they're cops who'd rather die than get locked up.
they're desperate.
she's coming to you.
have you got one in the chamber?
Yep.
let's roll.
Oh, God.
they rammed us.
we got off a few rounds.
they got away. We--we messed up.
DISPATCHER: We got a 10-71 on Highway 17.
all units respond. We've got a 1071
BLAKE: The safe house isn't too far away.
and Dinah will be waiting for us?
well, we may get there first.
Hey, Josh. Can I take a photo for your mom?
OK.
OK. Now, you want to give me a big smile?
great. Ok, go ahead.
he's with agents now.
Oh, my God.
do you agree to cooperate?
Yes.
just get me the hell out of here.
let's go.
I've got orders she's not to leave the premises.
you can tell your boss she's leaving with me.
you tell yours she's not.
let go of me.
unless you want to be arrested for obstruction of a federal investigation, let her go.
he's gone, right?
he is gone. They're letting us back in.
all right, good. You did it, baby girl.
I lost a couple karma points, but, uh-huh, I did it.
all right, I'm gonna be there in about 5 minutes.
I know you and the first victims witnessed deputy Owen kill the former sheriff.
why did he spare you?
when he looks at me, he sees dollar signs.
he runs everything through the pool hall and I don't say a word, 'cause if I did, he'd hurt my son.
and he's got a lot of help.
I mean, even if people aren't getting paid off, they're all too scared to say anything.
so the whole force knows?
enough of them.
JJ: What's he dealing?
Dinah: Everything.
he gets all the product he can and then he sells it to the highest bidder.
where does he get it?
steals it.
he even smuggles people across the border.
what are they gonna do? He wears a badge, they don't.
where would deputy McGregor go now that he knows we're closing in?
to a junkyard he controls on the edge of town.
his final move's going to be a distraction.
like what?
you ok?
Yeah. I'm just really tired.
of course you are. You need to get some sleep.
Oh, but how can you sleep? 'Cause you're in a hospital where people are always poking you.
he had his meds an hour ago.
Yeah, post-op antibiotics.
Yeah, he had those, too.
which ones?
Carbenicillin? No, that's not right.
I have a severe reaction to beta lactams.
I can't have that.
that's not in your chart.
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
Garcia! He has a gun!
he's moving.
OK.
I didn't know how loud.
I can't hear, 'cause my heart feels like it's gonna come out.
can that happen?
physically, can your heart burst out of your chest?
and what is this ringing?
my ears don't pop for like a week after I fly, and if this is like that, that's gonna drive me bonkers.
am I yelling?
because it feels like I might be yelling.
you saved my life.
can you hear me?
Yeah, I heard that. That makes it better.
thank you for saying that.
thank you for doing it.
OK. You're ok.
OK.
Oh, my sweet boy.
the closest federal support is an hour away.
I've called the Rangers.
how long for them. 30 minutes.
Hey, Morgan. Is everyone ok?
everything's fine. Don't worry. It was all a big distraction.
it's gotta be part of McGregor's end game.
he's headed to a junkyard. I'll send you the address.
OK. It's ok.
it's gonna be ok.
drop it!
huh. Look at this.
it's a booked flight.
maybe with the year we've all had, uh, the brass will give us a bigger plane, you know.
Yeah. Let me know how that goes.
JJ: What did the Rangers think?
Cruz: Sadly, they've seen this before.
they're going to have their hands full cleaning the place up.
Hotch, don't tell me we have another case.
are we turning the plane around?
no.
no, we're gonna go home and get some sleep.
lots of it, I hope.
I am starting now.
you sure you're ok?
I feel great.
Ah, that's overselling it.
I, uh, I feel great considering I just got shot in the neck.
where do you want this?
Any--right there is fine.
OK. So, you should get some sleep.
you all right?
who's Ethan?
my son.
he was 9 when he died.
still don't. That drove me crazy.
no word to put to this thing that took away my greatest love.
I'm sorry.
he kept growing despite his disease.
the last time I lay beside him he was almost as long as me.
he was ready to go.
but I wasn't ready to say good-bye.
I begged him to open his eyes.
and the cruelest part was that I could see who he would be at 20, but I knew he'd never get there.
Ethan is a great name.
Yeah.
it means enduring.
it's fitting.
you and James never let go of one another.
have you ever had that feeling that your future is somehow behind you?
all the time.
I did, too.
but it isn't.
Ethan would have been a lot like you.
thank you for being there when I woke up.
that meant a lot.
of course.
Bye, Alex.

now pull it in, run it back. Let's go.
come on.
I gotcha.
on swat, we broke shots down into 3 steps.
One--front sight.
focus on the front sight, not on the target.
2--controlled trigger press.
3--follow through.
after the shot, you come right back to the target.
now what did you do wrong? - I didn't follow through.
right. You came off the target to see where you hit.
Hotch, my firearms qualification is tomorrow morning.
I barely passed my last one.
front sight, trigger press...
follow through.
you do those 3 things, you'll hit your target every time.
I'm not fallin' for it.
come on, Pop.
stop playing.
Oh, my god.
dad!
dad!
did Elle teach you that?
they're gonna take away my gun.
a profiler is not required to carry.
yeah? And yet you carry 2 of them.
when I joined the BAU, Gideon said to me, "you don't have to carry a gun to kill someone.
I don't get it. - You will.
good luck tomorrow.
Reid failed his qualification. - He can re-test in 2 weeks.
Yeah, but he's gonna be embarrassed about it, so let's not mention it.
Yeah, let's not.
not a word.
Hey.
we're all here for you.
I'm serious.
if you ever need anything...
just blow on that.
OK, Franklin park, des plaines, yesterday afternoon.
3 victims shot at distance.
it's the third such shooting in 2 weeks.
a sniper? - We don't use that word.
why not?
the public perception is that the FBI doesn't have an exemplary record with snipers.
besides, a sniper is a professional marksman. These guys aren't snipers.
what do we call 'em then? - L.D.S.K.
long distance serial killers.
how many of these guys have we caught using a profile?
none.
2 weeks, 3 shooting incidents, 6 victims, all shot in the abdomen.
first and only fatality, Henry Sachs, married, father of 3, was shot in a shopping center parking lot.
9 days later, Doug Miller and Kevin Parks were playing basketball at a community center.
Franklin park, 4 days later, Jerry Middleton, Kate Murray, and Tim Reilly.
des Plaines police have found no link between any of the victims.
ballistics?
he's using frangible rounds, which fragment on impact, making ballistics comparisons impossible.
the good news is that all the park victims are gonna make it.
the bad new is that none of them saw anything.
however, one of the patients does have an intact bullet lodged in his spine.
what's the prognosis?
there's a disagreement among surgical staff as to whether they can remove the slug without paralyzing the patient.
well, without a useful witness or a solid piece of forensic evidence...
the profile's all we'll have.
nietzsche wrote, "the irrationality of a thing "is not an argument against it's existence, rather, a condition of it.
l. D.S. K.S are so rare, we haven't been able to build a standard profile.
here's what we do know: They're always male, and they frequently have law enforcement or military experience, and they always contact the police or the media.
to take credit or relive the experience?
both.
all serial killers attempt to relive the ecstasy they get from their killings.
some use souvenirs taken from the victims, and others return to the dump site to interact with the body.
both modes require contact with the victim, contact which, by definition, long distance serial killers don't have.
the beltway shooters left a tarot card at one of their crime scenes.
later they called a tip hotline, which ultimately led to their capture.
but our unsub hasn't contacted anybody.
he will.
until he does, what do we have?
sometimes it's not what the unsub does that reveals the profile.
sometimes it is what they do not do.
he doesn't kill his victims.
Underkill's a unique signature.
the question is, does he shoot them in the stomach intentionally just to wound them, or is he just aiming at the biggest part of the target?
specifically, does the unsub lack the skill to make the head shot, or simply the will to take it?
agent hotchner.
detective calvin, this is agent Morgan, agent Reid.
thanks for comin'. Follow me.
the cones mark the places where the victims were, so we know he fired from somewhere in this area.
close enough to hit all 3 victims, but far away enough not to be seen.
his wounding his victims intentionally would classify him as a sadistic killer.
that would help us?
we know a lot about sadists.
but most want to be close to their victims to watch them suffer.
a powerful scope would allow him to observe it from a safe distance
so how do we determine if he's a sadist?
we spend some time in his shoes.
we let him tell us.
come on, Barry, you don't know that!
good morning, doctors.
forgive us. We were just reviewing the cases at hand.
this is dr. Neil Erstadt, chief of surgery, and our trauma specialist, dr. Barry Landman.
these are the FBI profilers, agents Gideon, Jareau, Greenaway.
how are you?
forgive me. I don't shake.
my hands, you understand?
of course.
so as psychological profilers, s,what exactly are you looking for?
how the victims were shot.
that could reveal the shooter's signature behavior.
these separate wound channels blossom from the entrance wounds.
you can see the trauma's extensive.
you performed the surgeries? - On patient Miller.
I consulted with dr. Landman on the others.
the intact slug lodged between the l4-l5 vertebrae.
any attempt to remove it, would likely leave the patient paralyzed.
in your opinion.
in my opinion.
disagree?
with the right surgeon, there is no risk. - There's always risk.
what significance does the bullet have in building a profile?
well, even if we can't get a ballistics match, we can get a rifle type, and the specific type of rifle the suspect uses, that could be very significant to the profile.
you believe you can safely perform the surgery, dr. Landman?
I know I can.
this handicapped spot couldn't be further away from the entrance to the building.
yeah?
it also has line of sight to all 3 victims and the flagpole.
what are you thinkin'?
at this range, the unsub would have to factor in wind direction and speed as he shot.
to do this, he needed a spot with the widest field of fire and line of sight to the flagpole.
he came here before the shooting, decided this was his spot...
and ensured that it would be empty when he came back.
my guess is he's shooting from his car.
well, that would mean he wanted to get away from here quickly, that he didn't stick around to watch his victims suffer.
so he would not be a sadist.
what would he be?
a very smart, very resourceful, very paranoid sociopath.
if I'm the unsub, why do I shoot my victims between 2: 55 and 3: 15?
that's when I'd do it. There are fewer cops on the street.
why is that? - Well, the police overlap shifts so there's always someone minding the store.
second shift starts at 3: 00, first shift walks at 3: 30.
wouldn't there be twice as many cops on the street at that time?
in theory.
the first half-hour of your shift, you're in roll call.
you're not on the street.
and the last half-hour, you're at the station.
you're finishin' reports, you're booking prisoners, so the 25 minutes around the first/second shift, that's a bad guy's golden window.
how many people outside law enforcement would know that?
but the unsub does, and you've already thought of this.
I had considered it.
hope you find it useful.
Dr. Landman?
how's Mr. Middleton.
patient will make a full recovery...
as I told you he would.
radiology is set up to take photos and e-mail them out for consults.
call Hotch. We're gettin' the bullet to Garcia.
fill him in on the shift change theory.
give me a second.
Yeah. Morgan.
isn't this spooky?
isn't what spooky?
that right now you were thinking about me, and out of the blue, your phone rings?
and it's me. Huh?
how's that for a spiritual connection?
um... do I know you?
why do you hurt me?
Garcia, please tell me you've nailed down the geographic profile on our guy.
OK, I'll give you the good news first, which is not that good, but it's better than the bad.
we think the shooter has intimate knowledge of law enforcement procedures.
detective Calvin, how far out of your jurisdiction was crime scene number 2?
about a sixth of a mile. Why?
if he knew how difficult it is for local police departments to interact with each other, he may have intentionally crossed jurisdiction lines.
y'all are sayin' the shooter's a cop. - We're saying it's a possibility.
he scouted and prepped each crime scene.
he chose and elevated position with excellent enfilade and perfect field of fire.
that's textbook military practice. - True.
Yeah, but maybe he was in the army.
he was probably a marine, ranger or other specialized unit.
Garcia says the bullet was a . 223 fired from the m-4 variant of the m-16.
all the services use an m-4.
it's got a shorter barrel than the m-16.
it's less accurate, and it's a lot harder to fire, especially at these distances.
this level of skill indicates specialized training.
if he has specialized training, he knows exactly what he's doing.
he intended to wound them. - The underkill is deliberate.
everything he does is deliberate, but it's as if he needs to show us how smart he is.
since the crime scenes aren't centered around one single location, garcia can't get a geographic profile without additional data.
what kind of data? - More crime scenes.
she's gonna get 'em.
this guy's got something to prove.
how did it play out? - He's been suspended but my guess is that the school board's gonna go after him, and they're gonna try to expel him.
I don't feel very good.
I'm gonna go to the ladies' room, ok?
OK.
honey, you have something on your dress.
3 more victims with nonfatal wounds, and it's only been 48 hours since the last shooting.
the media attention and the fbi presence will only escalate his desire to shoot again.
Meaning?
this is gonna get much worse.
the we need to give the police a profile immediately.
you ready? - State troopers.
this is the second time he's crossed jurisdictions.
Yeah, we're ready. They're not gonna like it.
this initial profile is not ready to be given to the media.
releasing this profile prematurely can get people killed.
we're looking for a 30 to 40-year-old male veteran, driving a car large enough to shoot from, but not so large it was noticed.
like the beltway shooter, it's probably a sedan, customized to conceal the shooter, his weapon, and the sound of his shot.
the unsub suffers from both narcissistic and paranoid personality disorders.
he works out obsessively and is never without a weapon.
he's completely self-centered and cannot empathize with others.
incapable of admitting fault, he blames his shortcomings on those around him.
he has no friends, and his career history has been marked by frequent job changes.
he's drawn to high-stakes jobs by a need to prove his superiority to a world he perceives has undervalued him, and these shootings are the ultimate expression of that need.
we believe he changes jurisdictions intentionally and strikes during the first/second shift change, indicating and intimate knowledge of law enforcement.
you're saying he's one of us.
we're saying he once was or is now a police officer.
is he driving a white van, too?
enough.
that'll be all for now.
we can talk in my office.
thank you.
sergeant Weigart, we would like to reenact the third shooting during the shift change.
Why?
well, to better understand his M. O.
how does he get there? How does he leave?
what's the traffic like? - It could help us with witnesses.
maybe the victims or bystanders saw something, but don't realize the significance of what they saw.
all right, let's do it.
how you holdin' up?
look at me. Without a gun on my belt, I look like a teacher's assistant.
you're not worried about how you look.
Hotch told me that when he came to the bau, you told him he didn't need a gun to kill somebody?
well, the only truly effective weapon we have is our ability to do the one thing they can'T.
which is what? - Empathize.
they dehumanize their victims. We humanize the killers.
you're just saying that to convince me I don't need to carry a gun.
I don't care you carry a gun or not.
deadliest weapon we have is a thorough and accurate profile.
of course you believe that.
footpath killer, he had a shotgun in the back of my head.
I'm here, he's not.
Elle, jerry littleton was facing a little further south.
can you give it to us?
how's that?
perfect. Hold your camera right there.
it doesn't look like Jerry Middleton had a clear view of the sniper's vehicle when he was shot.
the tree branches were in the way.
I do have a clear view of the vehicle from here.
tim Reilly would have seen it if he'd looked down from the kite.
good. Have the unsub pop the trunk. See if Reid can see it.
no, sorry.
nothing from position one.
OK, everyone, move to position 2.
and now, we go to John Jenkins, reporting live from Franklin park with breaking news on the sniper investigation.
through anonymous sources we've learned - you gotta see this.
the FBI profilers have told the police task force the sniper is, in fact, a member of the Des Plaines police department.
who could have leaked this?
the only people who had the profile were your people.
and the profile implicates them.
why would a cop leak sensitive information the would not only implicate one of his own, but make every citizen in the county afraid to get pulled over?
what does he get out of it?
contact with the media.
what?
the cop who leaked this story is a good suspect.
contacting the media could have been his sick way of keeping this alive.
vic, why don't you go ahead and call the station and find out what they've got in mind for one of the later shows.
Mr. Jenkins, I'm special agent Jennifer Jareau with the FBI.
we need you to identify your source.
no way. I know my rights.
Hey, hey, shoot this. Vic, shoot this. Get this all on tape.
you should know the fbi considers these shootings an act of terrorism.
under the patriot act, we can detain you as long as we need to.
all I know is his cell number.
we have a lead.
rainmaker. How wet do you want it?
it's Hotch. I have a cell phone number, and I need the name on the account.
Yeah. If you call the cell, I can throw in the real time location, no charge.
are you ready? - I was born ready.
can't you pull your people out of the park?
if we do and the shooter is here, he'll sense something is wrong.
he could start shooting.
that cell is part of a batch purchased by the Des Plaines police department.
I need a name, Garcia.
it's gonna take a second. I have to pull it from their system.
then give me the location.
Franklin park, Des Plaines.
he's here.
the name, Garcia.
Mccarty's the unsub. - But where is he?
Mccarty is playing the unsub.
we need to talk to Scott Mccarty.
he's the leak.
Mccarty. Why am I not surprised?
I need swat in the lot asap.
it's Mccarty. We need to come heavy.
we didn't say he was the shooter.
we could just call him on the radio and tell him to come to us.
best case, he leaked the story.
worst case, I'm not about to let him take down any of my men.
we come heavy, and we take him clean.
this is Mccarty. What's goin' on?
toss your rifle and your side arm out of the vehicle and show us your hands.
I don't understand. - We know what you did, Scotty.
look, I can explain. - Don't make me give the order!
OK, all right! All right!
now open the trunk lid slowly.
come on.
that's it.
get him up.
get down!
how did Mccarty end up playing the unsub?
Weigart punished Mccarty for mouthing off during the profile briefing by making him the unsub and sticking him in the trunk of the car all afternoon.
wait. Then how did the unsub find out about the reenactment?
come on. Cops talk.
pissed-off cops talk loud
at home, at the bars, at gyms, and to anyone who'll listen.
what do we know?
our unsub went from wounding civilians to executing a police officer, so he's escalated.
he's not staying on script.
sometimes it's what they don't do.
he did not pick Mccarty at random.
he didn't take the gut shot. - Why?
he wants to send a message.
nobody takes credit for my work.
Yes, sir. His ego won't allow it.
he feels underappreciated.
OK, but we still don't know why he wounds them.
excuse me.
we know if the killer has no contact with his victims, he will contact the media.
but he hasn't contacted the media.
he has contact with his victims.
and there's only one way.
all right, thanks.
Garcia nailed down the geographic profile.
the crime scenes are centered on 2 separate locations.
the hospitals.
I believe it's a case of hero homicide.
what's that?
the best-known case was hospital nurse Richard Angelo.
he would inject toxins into his victims, then wait for them to crash so that he could run to the rescue and save them.
he killed 25 people, and that's just what we know of.
if he attacked 'em to save 'em, why'd he kill 25 people?
wasn't very good at it.
Yeah, and hospitals don't keep records of people who almost died.
so what's the profile on one of these guys?
arrogant, conceited, feels superior to everyone around them.
you've just described every surgeon I've ever met.
uh, forgive me. I don't shake.
my hands, you understand.
of course.
let's start with Landman.
call Weigart and tell him we need a discreet perimeter around this block.
I'm gonna go check out Landman's car.
OK. Courtesy of Garcia.
Landman was army, started out in M. P. School.
well, there's your law enforcement.
but he was smart, got a degree on uncle sam, and ended up a doctor with special forces and bounced around from hospital to hospital since his discharge in 2001.
has dr. Landman been Has he had a reprimand?
has he had any kind of major blow to his ego?
last month, he was passed over for chief of surgery.
let's get a warrant for his house. Let's see if we find the weapon.
OK.
what can I do to help?
you can tell me where he is right now.
Where's Marston?
she's not coming.
look, I'm very busy right now. Perhaps you could make an appointment.
busy with what?
things.
what kind of things?
you're considering me a suspect?
Yes.
well, that's disconcerting.
I heard what happened to your last suspect.
do you wanna know why? - Collective incompetence?
have you ever heard of hero homicide?
would I be less suspicious if I let my patients die?
Absolutely.
you get anything from his car?
it's a red 2-seat maserati.
Heh. Of course.
if he's the shooter, he has another vehicle.
this type of killer seeks the power over life and death and covets the power of god.
you know anyone like that? - I want you to understand something.
when my patients are in the operating room, they need god, and that's exactly what I give them.
when someone's holding your beating heart in their hands, who do you want holding it, me or god?
where were you today at 3: 00?
I was in my office. - Alone?
I was in my office with dr. Hannah Pate.
I'm not the only one who thinks I'm a god.
she's in the E. R. right now.
go on.
ask her.
great. Let's take a walk down to the E. R.
my guess, dr. Pate is gonna corroborate Landman's alibi.
you don't think landman's the shooter?
richard angelo wanted to be a hero because in his everyday life, he was a nobody.
Landman's a surgeon. He has power and recognition.
Yeah, but you know, surgeons are a different breed.
there are stars in the field, and Landman is definitely not one of them.
excuse me.
I'd like to speak with dr. Pate.
Yes, sir. I'll go find her for you.
the motivations for hero homicide are excitement, power, and respect, and even though Landman's not a star, he still gets respect.
racing against the clock to save someone's life is exciting.
but maybe it's not exciting enough.
that's--that's why he shoots 3 people at a time.
but he can only operate on one at a time.
it wouldn't be any more exciting.
at least, not for Landman and not in the O. R.
the policemen and E. R. Personnel are on the exact same 24-hour shift schedule.
the unsub wasn't shooting at shift change because there are fewer cops on the street.
he works the second shift in the emergency room.
contact with the victims.
sir, you can't use the cell phone in the hospital.
excuse me, please.
we're fbi agents, and we believe that one of your staff members might be the sniper.
the man we're looking for works second shift, and he would have transferred from Arlington about 2 weeks ago.
we haven't hired any new personnel in 2 months.
are you sure? - Yeah.
he has the worst narcissistic personality disorder I've ever seen, but it's not likely him.
look, I've got patients who need me.
he's in his thirties.
he's vain, rude, arrogant. He works out.
he shows up to work late.
he blames others for his mistakes, doesn't take responsibility for his behavior.
all of his coworkers detest him.
it's phillip dowd.
He's--he picks up shifts at Arlington.
is he here today?
Oh, my god. - Ok...
OK, your patients need you.
tell me, is dowd working today?
do you see him?
go tell Gideon.
nobody moves, and nobody dies.
better be a head shot.
I got this on full auto.
anything less, I go down squeezing the trigger.
get up!
get over here!
double time! Let's go!
you, take your partner's gun, put it on the counter.
he's not armed.
see for yourself.
hands on your heads.
get up, Keith.
put those on 'em.
now put 'em on yourself.
now step back.
back up. Back up. Back up.
get down on the ground.
have a seat.
now, what kind of an fbi agent doesn't carry a gun?
I'm a profiler.
profiler?
they sent you to figure me out.
we did. That's how we found you. - Shh. Keep quiet.
no, don't shut up.
tell me what you think you know about me.
go ahead, genius. Tell him.
tell him.
but remember, get it wrong, and he's gonna kill you.
OK.
you're the boss. You tell me.
who am I?
what's my plan?
I know you shot 11 people in broad daylight and left us nothing, you executed a cop in front of the fbi and got away clean, and I know your plan is to go down in a hail of bullets.
what else do you know?
he joined the army at 18, went to ranger school, did 6 years before being dishonorably discharged in '95 for conduct unbecoming, obviously lied about it, joined the arlington P. D.
you were right. He was a cop. - For 9 months.
when they found out he lied about the discharge, they kicked him out.
soon thereafter, dowd got his nursing license.
he's been bouncing from hospital to hospital ever since.
I know you're the smartest guy in every room you've ever been in, and no one's ever known it.
people feel threatened by you and try to sabotage you every chance they get.
you're not a bad person.
you help save all of your victims afterwards.
first guy wasn't your fault.
if the emts had been there on time, he would've lived.
took those guys 13 minutes. 13!
you want to barricade the door.
what? - Let me and the kid do it.
let 'em see that you've got 2 fbi agents in here doing your bidding.
right, let you give them a signal.
what signal? They knew you were in here.
they knew you were armed. What can I tell them?
what is this, some sort of profiler trick?
new negotiation tactic?
I think it's a good idea.
why would you wanna help me?
I don't.
you said they knew I was in here.
I said they know you're in here.
no. That's not what you said. - Why does it matter?
it matters because your partner wants to help me even though he doesn't know it.
go ahead, boss man.
tell him why.
if you lie or leave anything out, pop.
they knew he was in here, they knew he was armed and dangerous, and they knew that he was gonna fight till the last round, and they sent me in here with an unarmed kid who can't shoot his way out of a wet paper bag.
they set you up.
exactly, and they're probably laughing about it right now.
that's why you wanna help me.
I wouldn't say I want to help you, but when they come in here to get revenge for the cop you killed, you're gonna go down fighting, and in the crossfire, a lot of us are gonna die.
they sent me in here. I figure why make it easy for them.
can I talk to you for a minute?
please don't send your men in yet.
you have to consider the possibility that your men are dead or at least disarmed.
agent Hotch is a very experienced profiler.
he's gonna do whatever he has to to get Dowd to like, trust us.
and once he does...
he'll get Dowd to end this peacefully.
I--I just...ask that you give him time.
Dowd's already shot 10 people.
he killed a cop.
the cop is dead.
this man is a violent, deranged paranoid.
it's a game.
he's gonna--he's gonna do whatever he has to.
you send in your men, they're just gonna become villains in his little hero fantasy.
you're lettin' him call all the shots.
how are your unarmed men gonna stop him?
they're not unarmed. They have his profile.
they understand him.
3 minutes. Then my men are ready to take the E. R.
your men...have 3 minutes.
you know why they took away boy genius's gun?
Why?
he failed his qualification.
twice I year, I gotta listen to him whine about requalifying.
so I tutor him...
and he fails again.
you think you got it rough?
these people done nothing but undermine me since I got here.
put him next to the barricade.
that way, when they blast their way in here, both of our problems are solved.
that sort of thing can ruin a cop's career.
you are one sick dude.
how do you think I found you?
time's up.
ready teams for assault.
can I ask you a favor? - You can ask.
I figure the chances of my getting out of here alive are pretty slim.
so?
I want to kick the snot out of this kid.
he's made my life miserable for 3 lousy years.
go ahead. Knock yourself out.
how smart are you now, smart guy?!
it's front sight, trigger press, follow through!
that's enough!
it's not that hard!
a dalmatian could do it!
let go! Let go!
feel better?
I think he got a messege
what's that?
we go in 5...
we go now!
hold your fire!
hold your fire!
it's all clear.
Shakespeare wrote, "nothing is so common as the wish to be remarkable.
you all right?
nice shot.
I was aiming for his leg.
I wouldn't have kept kicking, but I was afraid you didn't get my plans.
I got your plan the minute you moved the hostages out of my line of fire.
well, I hope I didn't hurt you too badly.
Hotch, I was a 12-year-old child prodigy in a Las Vegas public high school.
you kick like a 9-year-old girl.
no. Keep it.
as far as I'm concerned, you passed your qualification.
Reid, you all right?
Touche, kid.
how you doin'?
you were right. You don't need a gun to kill somebody.
no, you don't.
but it helps.
Yes.
Yes.
I--I know I should feel bad about...what happened.
I mean...
I killed a man.
you know, I--I should...feel something.
but I don't.
well, knowing what you're feelin'...
that's not the same as not feelin'.
this is gonna hurt you...
and when it does...
there's only 3 facts you need to know.
you did what you had to do...
and a lot of good people are alive because of what you did.
what's the third?
I'm proud of you.
now pull it in, run it back. Let's go.
come on.
I gotcha.
on swat, we broke shots down into 3 steps.
One--front sight.
focus on the front sight, not on the target.
2--controlled trigger press.
3--follow through.
after the shot, you come right back to the target.
now what did you do wrong? - I didn't follow through.
right. You came off the target to see where you hit.
Hotch, my firearms qualification is tomorrow morning.
I barely passed my last one.
front sight, trigger press...
follow through.
you do those 3 things, you'll hit your target every time.
I'm not fallin' for it.
come on, Pop.
stop playing.
Oh, my god.
dad!
dad!
did Elle teach you that?
they're gonna take away my gun.
a profiler is not required to carry.
yeah? And yet you carry 2 of them.
when I joined the BAU, Gideon said to me, "you don't have to carry a gun to kill someone.
I don't get it. - You will.
good luck tomorrow.
Reid failed his qualification. - He can re-test in 2 weeks.
Yeah, but he's gonna be embarrassed about it, so let's not mention it.
Yeah, let's not.
not a word.
Hey.
we're all here for you.
I'm serious.
if you ever need anything...
just blow on that.
OK, Franklin park, des plaines, yesterday afternoon.
3 victims shot at distance.
it's the third such shooting in 2 weeks.
a sniper? - We don't use that word.
why not?
the public perception is that the FBI doesn't have an exemplary record with snipers.
besides, a sniper is a professional marksman. These guys aren't snipers.
what do we call 'em then? - L.D.S.K.
long distance serial killers.
how many of these guys have we caught using a profile?
none.
2 weeks, 3 shooting incidents, 6 victims, all shot in the abdomen.
first and only fatality, Henry Sachs, married, father of 3, was shot in a shopping center parking lot.
9 days later, Doug Miller and Kevin Parks were playing basketball at a community center.
Franklin park, 4 days later, Jerry Middleton, Kate Murray, and Tim Reilly.
des Plaines police have found no link between any of the victims.
ballistics?
he's using frangible rounds, which fragment on impact, making ballistics comparisons impossible.
the good news is that all the park victims are gonna make it.
the bad new is that none of them saw anything.
however, one of the patients does have an intact bullet lodged in his spine.
what's the prognosis?
there's a disagreement among surgical staff as to whether they can remove the slug without paralyzing the patient.
well, without a useful witness or a solid piece of forensic evidence...
the profile's all we'll have.
nietzsche wrote, "the irrationality of a thing "is not an argument against it's existence, rather, a condition of it.
l. D.S. K.S are so rare, we haven't been able to build a standard profile.
here's what we do know: They're always male, and they frequently have law enforcement or military experience, and they always contact the police or the media.
to take credit or relive the experience?
both.
all serial killers attempt to relive the ecstasy they get from their killings.
some use souvenirs taken from the victims, and others return to the dump site to interact with the body.
both modes require contact with the victim, contact which, by definition, long distance serial killers don't have.
the beltway shooters left a tarot card at one of their crime scenes.
later they called a tip hotline, which ultimately led to their capture.
but our unsub hasn't contacted anybody.
he will.
until he does, what do we have?
sometimes it's not what the unsub does that reveals the profile.
sometimes it is what they do not do.
he doesn't kill his victims.
Underkill's a unique signature.
the question is, does he shoot them in the stomach intentionally just to wound them, or is he just aiming at the biggest part of the target?
specifically, does the unsub lack the skill to make the head shot, or simply the will to take it?
agent hotchner.
detective calvin, this is agent Morgan, agent Reid.
thanks for comin'. Follow me.
the cones mark the places where the victims were, so we know he fired from somewhere in this area.
close enough to hit all 3 victims, but far away enough not to be seen.
his wounding his victims intentionally would classify him as a sadistic killer.
that would help us?
we know a lot about sadists.
but most want to be close to their victims to watch them suffer.
a powerful scope would allow him to observe it from a safe distance
so how do we determine if he's a sadist?
we spend some time in his shoes.
we let him tell us.
come on, Barry, you don't know that!
good morning, doctors.
forgive us. We were just reviewing the cases at hand.
this is dr. Neil Erstadt, chief of surgery, and our trauma specialist, dr. Barry Landman.
these are the FBI profilers, agents Gideon, Jareau, Greenaway.
how are you?
forgive me. I don't shake.
my hands, you understand?
of course.
so as psychological profilers, s,what exactly are you looking for?
how the victims were shot.
that could reveal the shooter's signature behavior.
these separate wound channels blossom from the entrance wounds.
you can see the trauma's extensive.
you performed the surgeries? - On patient Miller.
I consulted with dr. Landman on the others.
the intact slug lodged between the l4-l5 vertebrae.
any attempt to remove it, would likely leave the patient paralyzed.
in your opinion.
in my opinion.
disagree?
with the right surgeon, there is no risk. - There's always risk.
what significance does the bullet have in building a profile?
well, even if we can't get a ballistics match, we can get a rifle type, and the specific type of rifle the suspect uses, that could be very significant to the profile.
you believe you can safely perform the surgery, dr. Landman?
I know I can.
this handicapped spot couldn't be further away from the entrance to the building.
yeah?
it also has line of sight to all 3 victims and the flagpole.
what are you thinkin'?
at this range, the unsub would have to factor in wind direction and speed as he shot.
to do this, he needed a spot with the widest field of fire and line of sight to the flagpole.
he came here before the shooting, decided this was his spot...
and ensured that it would be empty when he came back.
my guess is he's shooting from his car.
well, that would mean he wanted to get away from here quickly, that he didn't stick around to watch his victims suffer.
so he would not be a sadist.
what would he be?
a very smart, very resourceful, very paranoid sociopath.
if I'm the unsub, why do I shoot my victims between 2: 55 and 3: 15?
that's when I'd do it. There are fewer cops on the street.
why is that? - Well, the police overlap shifts so there's always someone minding the store.
second shift starts at 3: 00, first shift walks at 3: 30.
wouldn't there be twice as many cops on the street at that time?
in theory.
the first half-hour of your shift, you're in roll call.
you're not on the street.
and the last half-hour, you're at the station.
you're finishin' reports, you're booking prisoners, so the 25 minutes around the first/second shift, that's a bad guy's golden window.
how many people outside law enforcement would know that?
but the unsub does, and you've already thought of this.
I had considered it.
hope you find it useful.
Dr. Landman?
how's Mr. Middleton.
patient will make a full recovery...
as I told you he would.
radiology is set up to take photos and e-mail them out for consults.
call Hotch. We're gettin' the bullet to Garcia.
fill him in on the shift change theory.
give me a second.
Yeah. Morgan.
isn't this spooky?
isn't what spooky?
that right now you were thinking about me, and out of the blue, your phone rings?
and it's me. Huh?
how's that for a spiritual connection?
um... do I know you?
why do you hurt me?
Garcia, please tell me you've nailed down the geographic profile on our guy.
OK, I'll give you the good news first, which is not that good, but it's better than the bad.
we think the shooter has intimate knowledge of law enforcement procedures.
detective Calvin, how far out of your jurisdiction was crime scene number 2?
about a sixth of a mile. Why?
if he knew how difficult it is for local police departments to interact with each other, he may have intentionally crossed jurisdiction lines.
y'all are sayin' the shooter's a cop. - We're saying it's a possibility.
he scouted and prepped each crime scene.
he chose and elevated position with excellent enfilade and perfect field of fire.
that's textbook military practice. - True.
Yeah, but maybe he was in the army.
he was probably a marine, ranger or other specialized unit.
Garcia says the bullet was a . 223 fired from the m-4 variant of the m-16.
all the services use an m-4.
it's got a shorter barrel than the m-16.
it's less accurate, and it's a lot harder to fire, especially at these distances.
this level of skill indicates specialized training.
if he has specialized training, he knows exactly what he's doing.
he intended to wound them. - The underkill is deliberate.
everything he does is deliberate, but it's as if he needs to show us how smart he is.
since the crime scenes aren't centered around one single location, garcia can't get a geographic profile without additional data.
what kind of data? - More crime scenes.
she's gonna get 'em.
this guy's got something to prove.
how did it play out? - He's been suspended but my guess is that the school board's gonna go after him, and they're gonna try to expel him.
I don't feel very good.
I'm gonna go to the ladies' room, ok?
OK.
honey, you have something on your dress.
3 more victims with nonfatal wounds, and it's only been 48 hours since the last shooting.
the media attention and the fbi presence will only escalate his desire to shoot again.
Meaning?
this is gonna get much worse.
the we need to give the police a profile immediately.
you ready? - State troopers.
this is the second time he's crossed jurisdictions.
Yeah, we're ready. They're not gonna like it.
this initial profile is not ready to be given to the media.
releasing this profile prematurely can get people killed.
we're looking for a 30 to 40-year-old male veteran, driving a car large enough to shoot from, but not so large it was noticed.
like the beltway shooter, it's probably a sedan, customized to conceal the shooter, his weapon, and the sound of his shot.
the unsub suffers from both narcissistic and paranoid personality disorders.
he works out obsessively and is never without a weapon.
he's completely self-centered and cannot empathize with others.
incapable of admitting fault, he blames his shortcomings on those around him.
he has no friends, and his career history has been marked by frequent job changes.
he's drawn to high-stakes jobs by a need to prove his superiority to a world he perceives has undervalued him, and these shootings are the ultimate expression of that need.
we believe he changes jurisdictions intentionally and strikes during the first/second shift change, indicating and intimate knowledge of law enforcement.
you're saying he's one of us.
we're saying he once was or is now a police officer.
is he driving a white van, too?
enough.
that'll be all for now.
we can talk in my office.
thank you.
sergeant Weigart, we would like to reenact the third shooting during the shift change.
Why?
well, to better understand his M. O.
how does he get there? How does he leave?
what's the traffic like? - It could help us with witnesses.
maybe the victims or bystanders saw something, but don't realize the significance of what they saw.
all right, let's do it.
how you holdin' up?
look at me. Without a gun on my belt, I look like a teacher's assistant.
you're not worried about how you look.
Hotch told me that when he came to the bau, you told him he didn't need a gun to kill somebody?
well, the only truly effective weapon we have is our ability to do the one thing they can'T.
which is what? - Empathize.
they dehumanize their victims. We humanize the killers.
you're just saying that to convince me I don't need to carry a gun.
I don't care you carry a gun or not.
deadliest weapon we have is a thorough and accurate profile.
of course you believe that.
footpath killer, he had a shotgun in the back of my head.
I'm here, he's not.
Elle, jerry littleton was facing a little further south.
can you give it to us?
how's that?
perfect. Hold your camera right there.
it doesn't look like Jerry Middleton had a clear view of the sniper's vehicle when he was shot.
the tree branches were in the way.
I do have a clear view of the vehicle from here.
tim Reilly would have seen it if he'd looked down from the kite.
good. Have the unsub pop the trunk. See if Reid can see it.
no, sorry.
nothing from position one.
OK, everyone, move to position 2.
and now, we go to John Jenkins, reporting live from Franklin park with breaking news on the sniper investigation.
through anonymous sources we've learned - you gotta see this.
the FBI profilers have told the police task force the sniper is, in fact, a member of the Des Plaines police department.
who could have leaked this?
the only people who had the profile were your people.
and the profile implicates them.
why would a cop leak sensitive information the would not only implicate one of his own, but make every citizen in the county afraid to get pulled over?
what does he get out of it?
contact with the media.
what?
the cop who leaked this story is a good suspect.
contacting the media could have been his sick way of keeping this alive.
vic, why don't you go ahead and call the station and find out what they've got in mind for one of the later shows.
Mr. Jenkins, I'm special agent Jennifer Jareau with the FBI.
we need you to identify your source.
no way. I know my rights.
Hey, hey, shoot this. Vic, shoot this. Get this all on tape.
you should know the fbi considers these shootings an act of terrorism.
under the patriot act, we can detain you as long as we need to.
all I know is his cell number.
we have a lead.
rainmaker. How wet do you want it?
it's Hotch. I have a cell phone number, and I need the name on the account.
Yeah. If you call the cell, I can throw in the real time location, no charge.
are you ready? - I was born ready.
can't you pull your people out of the park?
if we do and the shooter is here, he'll sense something is wrong.
he could start shooting.
that cell is part of a batch purchased by the Des Plaines police department.
I need a name, Garcia.
it's gonna take a second. I have to pull it from their system.
then give me the location.
Franklin park, Des Plaines.
he's here.
the name, Garcia.
Mccarty's the unsub. - But where is he?
Mccarty is playing the unsub.
we need to talk to Scott Mccarty.
he's the leak.
Mccarty. Why am I not surprised?
I need swat in the lot asap.
it's Mccarty. We need to come heavy.
we didn't say he was the shooter.
we could just call him on the radio and tell him to come to us.
best case, he leaked the story.
worst case, I'm not about to let him take down any of my men.
we come heavy, and we take him clean.
this is Mccarty. What's goin' on?
toss your rifle and your side arm out of the vehicle and show us your hands.
I don't understand. - We know what you did, Scotty.
look, I can explain. - Don't make me give the order!
OK, all right! All right!
now open the trunk lid slowly.
come on.
that's it.
get him up.
get down!
how did Mccarty end up playing the unsub?
Weigart punished Mccarty for mouthing off during the profile briefing by making him the unsub and sticking him in the trunk of the car all afternoon.
wait. Then how did the unsub find out about the reenactment?
come on. Cops talk.
pissed-off cops talk loud
at home, at the bars, at gyms, and to anyone who'll listen.
what do we know?
our unsub went from wounding civilians to executing a police officer, so he's escalated.
he's not staying on script.
sometimes it's what they don't do.
he did not pick Mccarty at random.
he didn't take the gut shot. - Why?
he wants to send a message.
nobody takes credit for my work.
Yes, sir. His ego won't allow it.
he feels underappreciated.
OK, but we still don't know why he wounds them.
excuse me.
we know if the killer has no contact with his victims, he will contact the media.
but he hasn't contacted the media.
he has contact with his victims.
and there's only one way.
all right, thanks.
Garcia nailed down the geographic profile.
the crime scenes are centered on 2 separate locations.
the hospitals.
I believe it's a case of hero homicide.
what's that?
the best-known case was hospital nurse Richard Angelo.
he would inject toxins into his victims, then wait for them to crash so that he could run to the rescue and save them.
he killed 25 people, and that's just what we know of.
if he attacked 'em to save 'em, why'd he kill 25 people?
wasn't very good at it.
Yeah, and hospitals don't keep records of people who almost died.
so what's the profile on one of these guys?
arrogant, conceited, feels superior to everyone around them.
you've just described every surgeon I've ever met.
uh, forgive me. I don't shake.
my hands, you understand.
of course.
let's start with Landman.
call Weigart and tell him we need a discreet perimeter around this block.
I'm gonna go check out Landman's car.
OK. Courtesy of Garcia.
Landman was army, started out in M. P. School.
well, there's your law enforcement.
but he was smart, got a degree on uncle sam, and ended up a doctor with special forces and bounced around from hospital to hospital since his discharge in 2001.
has dr. Landman been Has he had a reprimand?
has he had any kind of major blow to his ego?
last month, he was passed over for chief of surgery.
let's get a warrant for his house. Let's see if we find the weapon.
OK.
what can I do to help?
you can tell me where he is right now.
Where's Marston?
she's not coming.
look, I'm very busy right now. Perhaps you could make an appointment.
busy with what?
things.
what kind of things?
you're considering me a suspect?
Yes.
well, that's disconcerting.
I heard what happened to your last suspect.
do you wanna know why? - Collective incompetence?
have you ever heard of hero homicide?
would I be less suspicious if I let my patients die?
Absolutely.
you get anything from his car?
it's a red 2-seat maserati.
Heh. Of course.
if he's the shooter, he has another vehicle.
this type of killer seeks the power over life and death and covets the power of god.
you know anyone like that? - I want you to understand something.
when my patients are in the operating room, they need god, and that's exactly what I give them.
when someone's holding your beating heart in their hands, who do you want holding it, me or god?
where were you today at 3: 00?
I was in my office. - Alone?
I was in my office with dr. Hannah Pate.
I'm not the only one who thinks I'm a god.
she's in the E. R. right now.
go on.
ask her.
great. Let's take a walk down to the E. R.
my guess, dr. Pate is gonna corroborate Landman's alibi.
you don't think landman's the shooter?
richard angelo wanted to be a hero because in his everyday life, he was a nobody.
Landman's a surgeon. He has power and recognition.
Yeah, but you know, surgeons are a different breed.
there are stars in the field, and Landman is definitely not one of them.
excuse me.
I'd like to speak with dr. Pate.
Yes, sir. I'll go find her for you.
the motivations for hero homicide are excitement, power, and respect, and even though Landman's not a star, he still gets respect.
racing against the clock to save someone's life is exciting.
but maybe it's not exciting enough.
that's--that's why he shoots 3 people at a time.
but he can only operate on one at a time.
it wouldn't be any more exciting.
at least, not for Landman and not in the O. R.
the policemen and E. R. Personnel are on the exact same 24-hour shift schedule.
the unsub wasn't shooting at shift change because there are fewer cops on the street.
he works the second shift in the emergency room.
contact with the victims.
sir, you can't use the cell phone in the hospital.
excuse me, please.
we're fbi agents, and we believe that one of your staff members might be the sniper.
the man we're looking for works second shift, and he would have transferred from Arlington about 2 weeks ago.
we haven't hired any new personnel in 2 months.
are you sure? - Yeah.
he has the worst narcissistic personality disorder I've ever seen, but it's not likely him.
look, I've got patients who need me.
he's in his thirties.
he's vain, rude, arrogant. He works out.
he shows up to work late.
he blames others for his mistakes, doesn't take responsibility for his behavior.
all of his coworkers detest him.
it's phillip dowd.
He's--he picks up shifts at Arlington.
is he here today?
Oh, my god. - Ok...
OK, your patients need you.
tell me, is dowd working today?
do you see him?
go tell Gideon.
nobody moves, and nobody dies.
better be a head shot.
I got this on full auto.
anything less, I go down squeezing the trigger.
get up!
get over here!
double time! Let's go!
you, take your partner's gun, put it on the counter.
he's not armed.
see for yourself.
hands on your heads.
get up, Keith.
put those on 'em.
now put 'em on yourself.
now step back.
back up. Back up. Back up.
get down on the ground.
have a seat.
now, what kind of an fbi agent doesn't carry a gun?
I'm a profiler.
profiler?
they sent you to figure me out.
we did. That's how we found you. - Shh. Keep quiet.
no, don't shut up.
tell me what you think you know about me.
go ahead, genius. Tell him.
tell him.
but remember, get it wrong, and he's gonna kill you.
OK.
you're the boss. You tell me.
who am I?
what's my plan?
I know you shot 11 people in broad daylight and left us nothing, you executed a cop in front of the fbi and got away clean, and I know your plan is to go down in a hail of bullets.
what else do you know?
he joined the army at 18, went to ranger school, did 6 years before being dishonorably discharged in '95 for conduct unbecoming, obviously lied about it, joined the arlington P. D.
you were right. He was a cop. - For 9 months.
when they found out he lied about the discharge, they kicked him out.
soon thereafter, dowd got his nursing license.
he's been bouncing from hospital to hospital ever since.
I know you're the smartest guy in every room you've ever been in, and no one's ever known it.
people feel threatened by you and try to sabotage you every chance they get.
you're not a bad person.
you help save all of your victims afterwards.
first guy wasn't your fault.
if the emts had been there on time, he would've lived.
took those guys 13 minutes. 13!
you want to barricade the door.
what? - Let me and the kid do it.
let 'em see that you've got 2 fbi agents in here doing your bidding.
right, let you give them a signal.
what signal? They knew you were in here.
they knew you were armed. What can I tell them?
what is this, some sort of profiler trick?
new negotiation tactic?
I think it's a good idea.
why would you wanna help me?
I don't.
you said they knew I was in here.
I said they know you're in here.
no. That's not what you said. - Why does it matter?
it matters because your partner wants to help me even though he doesn't know it.
go ahead, boss man.
tell him why.
if you lie or leave anything out, pop.
they knew he was in here, they knew he was armed and dangerous, and they knew that he was gonna fight till the last round, and they sent me in here with an unarmed kid who can't shoot his way out of a wet paper bag.
they set you up.
exactly, and they're probably laughing about it right now.
that's why you wanna help me.
I wouldn't say I want to help you, but when they come in here to get revenge for the cop you killed, you're gonna go down fighting, and in the crossfire, a lot of us are gonna die.
they sent me in here. I figure why make it easy for them.
can I talk to you for a minute?
please don't send your men in yet.
you have to consider the possibility that your men are dead or at least disarmed.
agent Hotch is a very experienced profiler.
he's gonna do whatever he has to to get Dowd to like, trust us.
and once he does...
he'll get Dowd to end this peacefully.
I--I just...ask that you give him time.
Dowd's already shot 10 people.
he killed a cop.
the cop is dead.
this man is a violent, deranged paranoid.
it's a game.
he's gonna--he's gonna do whatever he has to.
you send in your men, they're just gonna become villains in his little hero fantasy.
you're lettin' him call all the shots.
how are your unarmed men gonna stop him?
they're not unarmed. They have his profile.
they understand him.
3 minutes. Then my men are ready to take the E. R.
your men...have 3 minutes.
you know why they took away boy genius's gun?
Why?
he failed his qualification.
twice I year, I gotta listen to him whine about requalifying.
so I tutor him...
and he fails again.
you think you got it rough?
these people done nothing but undermine me since I got here.
put him next to the barricade.
that way, when they blast their way in here, both of our problems are solved.
that sort of thing can ruin a cop's career.
you are one sick dude.
how do you think I found you?
time's up.
ready teams for assault.
can I ask you a favor? - You can ask.
I figure the chances of my getting out of here alive are pretty slim.
so?
I want to kick the snot out of this kid.
he's made my life miserable for 3 lousy years.
go ahead. Knock yourself out.
how smart are you now, smart guy?!
it's front sight, trigger press, follow through!
that's enough!
it's not that hard!
a dalmatian could do it!
let go! Let go!
feel better?
I think he got a messege
what's that?
we go in 5...
we go now!
hold your fire!
hold your fire!
it's all clear.
Shakespeare wrote, "nothing is so common as the wish to be remarkable.
you all right?
nice shot.
I was aiming for his leg.
I wouldn't have kept kicking, but I was afraid you didn't get my plans.
I got your plan the minute you moved the hostages out of my line of fire.
well, I hope I didn't hurt you too badly.
Hotch, I was a 12-year-old child prodigy in a Las Vegas public high school.
you kick like a 9-year-old girl.
no. Keep it.
as far as I'm concerned, you passed your qualification.
Reid, you all right?
Touche, kid.
how you doin'?
you were right. You don't need a gun to kill somebody.
no, you don't.
but it helps.
Yes.
Yes.
I--I know I should feel bad about...what happened.
I mean...
I killed a man.
you know, I--I should...feel something.
but I don't.
well, knowing what you're feelin'...
that's not the same as not feelin'.
this is gonna hurt you...
and when it does...
there's only 3 facts you need to know.
you did what you had to do...
and a lot of good people are alive because of what you did.
what's the third?
I'm proud of you.
how much farther?
what?
are we almost done?
you want to stop?
no.
let's rest a while.
I promised I wouldn't slow you down.
you go ahead. I'll catch up.
I can wait.
Adam, please. It's your workout.
go. I'll meet you at the point.
you're out of shape, cheerleader.
Oh, yeah?
let's see you do 3 back flips and land in the splits.
the point?
the point.
Hello?
is somebody there?
if you're trying to scare me, I'm gonna kill you.
Oh, my god. Adam, please wake up. Adam.
baby, please, baby. Please!
Noooo!
victim's the Loyd boy, isn't it?
the quarterback?
just saw his parents yesterday heading up to Nantucket.
listen get me their number up there, will you?
sheriff Bridges.
there's something here.
what is it?
you're gonna want to see this, sir.
looks like the head is busted open.
just like Adam Loyd.
you want me to get the crime scene folks down here?
Yeah.
wait. Hold on.
we're gonna need a lot more than the crime scene folks.
easy there, tough guy. Have some coffee with your sugar.
I need something to wake me up.
Ooh. Late night?
very.
my man.
not that kind of late night.
OK, so tell me, what does keep young Dr. Reid awake at night?
wait, let me guess.
memorizing some obscure textbook.
no, no, no, no.
working on cold fusion.
no, I got it.
watching Star Trek... and laughing at the physics mistakes.
actually, there aren't that many scientific errors in Star Trek.
especially considering how long ago it was made.
there are certain improbabilities, but not that many outright errors.
right.
Hey, Morgan?
uh, do you ever have dreams?
I'm sorry.
I guess nightmares would be a more accurate description.
is that what's keeping you up?
I used to get them occasionally but lately it's like I have them every night.
what are they about?
this. What we do.
do you have nightmares?
Reid, I'm not sure if I'm the right person for you to talk to about this.
why not?
it's just, uh...
did you ask Gideon about it?
no.
you should.
Hey, Hotch wants everyone in the round table room.
something up with you two?
no.
McAllister. Western slope of Massanutten mountain in Virginia.
2 bodies discovered in the woods both with apparent blunt trauma to the head.
skeletons?
one of them. The second victim was just killed this morning.
how do we know there's a connection?
they were found about 75 feet apart with nearly identical head wounds.
Where's the rest of the case file?
there isn't one. The sheriffs are on the scene waiting for us.
their location is only a half hour away by plane.
what's the rush?
well, there was evidence on the scene that could cause a bit of a public uproar.
a satanic cult.
so Peter Ustinov said, "unfortunately a super-abundance of dreams is paid for by a growing potential for nightmares.
JJ, we need to obviously, keep this out of the press for as long as possible.
I'll do what I can.
why is that so important?
there was a nationwide scare in the 1980s involving satanic ritual killings and abuse.
the satanic panic, it was called.
it began after the publication of a book about repressed memories being recovered through hypnotherapy.
memories of growing up with devil worshippers who use children in their rituals and ceremonies.
most of the claims were later found to be false or just impossible.
still, numerous therapists accepted the assertions as true and began searching for similar signs in their own patients.
after one year, thousands of people reported the exact same repressed memories.
the bureau conducted an investigation and concluded that most of the most of the ritual killings or abuse were more urban legend than anything else.
you're saying that there's no such thing as devil worship?
not at all.
but most of the satanism that we've seen is juveniles damaging property, desecrating churches, cemeteries.
to my knowledge, there has never been a proven case of a satanic ritual killing in the united states.
well, maybe there is now.
mornin'.
Yeah. We spoke on the phone.
I'm agent Jareau, and this is agent Gideon and Dr. Reid with the FBI's behavioral analysis unit.
Hi.
thanks for coming out so fast.
Yeah. Of course.
there was an in-service in Charlottesville last year said if we ran into any unusual homicides we were supposed to call you folks sooner rather than later.
Yeah, they were right.
is this unusual enough?
it certainly is interesting.
you guys must get a lot of this, huh?
satanic stuff?
not really.
who found the bodies?
a hiker found the first one at the trail and my deputies located this one while searching for evidence.
we don't even know if it's a man or a woman.
it's a man.
the male pelvis is more narrow and the opening at the bottom is heart-shaped, as opposed to oval.
melted wax?
candle wax?
candles are used in rituals.
they're also used on birthday cakes.
actually, they were originally used to protect the birthday celebrant from demons for the coming year.
as a matter of fact, down to the fourth century christianity rejected the birthday celebration as a pagan ritual.
