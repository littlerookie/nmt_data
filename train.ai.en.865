attention!
gentlemen,
I want you to make sure you're fully loaded and ready to go.
tonight you will encounter steep resistance.
not everyone will make it.
but for the ones that do, this will be a day long remembered.
long remembered, sir!
and years after we're gone, history will remember the name Delta Ti Gamma.
sir, yes, sir. Delta Ti Gamma, sir.
okay, boys.
lock and load.
move out!
come on, let's move out.
let's go, move it, move it!
you gonna be mice or men? Let's go, freshmen!
red leader, this is blue leader.
codeword is eminent.
man: Green leader, this is red leader. Civillan in sight.
radlo silent. I repeat radio silent.
I have to get going. Otherwise Guy will get started without me.
okay, see you tomorrow, Kira.
man: Purple and orange squadron I'm on the leader.
man #2: We don't have a purple and orange squadron.
man: Shut up. - Man #2: Make me.
operation nearly compromised, but we are a go.
repeat... we are a go.
you've tried the rest, - now try the best.
Oh, gross!
Mmm. Larger or light?
light. - Well, then don't stop.
fill me up, soldier.
God! Oh, God! Greg!
so embarrassing.
why, you son of a bitch.
if I see those pictures on the Internet, you're a dead man, Greg.
a dead man, you hear me?
Greg, you're such an asshole.
I saved myself for you.
I did not know that one of my pledges was gonna do this.
I promise. I promise that I'm gonna severely chastise him.
that's what I'm gonna do, chastise him.
let me take a look at my artwork. And to think they call this a hazing.
Oh, not my best angle, but it'll do.
I hate him. So stupid.
I hate Greg. I should have known.
man #3: Oh my God. My God, are you all right, Tracy?
I can't believe I hit you. Are you okay?
I think so, Professor. I'll be okay, thanks.
too bad.
you're very beautiful. Sorry I have to do this to you.
but if all goes well, you'll be up and at 'em in a few hours.
good. No pulse.
come on.
come on!
breathe!
Oh, shit, I don't believe it.
how could it have not worked? It should have worked.
your motor functions, your higher brain functions should have all been restored.
this can't be. It's ridiculous.
I changed the sequence, the base pairs. It should work.
it must work.
even now you hold the secrets of eternal life within you.
you hold on to them, keeping me alone.
alone in the dark.
I'll never be able to bring the dead back.
my institute all gone, vanished.
it's all a foolish dream.
I failed.
I am a complete and utter failure.
reports of a disturbance by Strug Dormitory.
dispatch units.
power to overwhelm and destroy.
all obsessed with...
nature's deepest mystery. The world's most...
everything around me...
Hike!
I'm open!
Yeah!
he was cruel and a sadist.
so what is it that you do exactly, Mr. Lancaster?
come on, call me Jake, Alexandra.
okay, Jake, what is it exactly that you do?
I mean, when you're not charming the pants off the ladies, that is.
I'm a doctor. A neurologist, actually.
Really? I'm surprised you're still on the market.
just haven't found the right girl yet.
what about you?
you're online profile doesn't say much, and all I know now is that you are beautiful with a great personality.
philippe, I go on break.
Hey, buddy.
eat.
what is your problem?
you want a filet mignon, you get a job.
what is it, Jacques?
the son of a bitch bum bite my finger.
let me look at it.
keep that on it. I'll be right back.
the world has gone crazy, huh?
nobody like French people.
this entire mission was a waste of time.
we lost a lot of good men out there.
sorry, sir. I thought we were onto something this time.
you should take a look at this.
it's a new infectlon. - Is this first generation?
could be. Based on the reported outbreaks to date, we've extrapolated the point of origin there.
get me Nightingale in here right away.
you got it.
Ellis, I am sorry about your brother.
Yeah, me too.
excuse me a second. Getting paged.
could be the office calling.
someone needs, you know, brain work or something.
be right back.
Yeah, she's totally hot, man.
every time I go on one of these fucking dates they're usually heifers.
this one is a fucking babe. She's got a great rack, too.
I owe you big time. If I bag her tonight
I'll call you in the a. m. I told her I'm a fucking neurologist.
she bought it hook, line and sinker.
what happened to you? Are you all right, Philippe?
a little problem in the kitchen.
problem? Nothing serious, I hope.
no, just a...
the chef got bit.
bit? - By a homeless man.
wait.
you can't go in there.
Alexandra, where are you going?
what's going on?
you can't come back here.
Jacques.
get away from him.
what was that thing? What the hell happened to Jacques?
Hey, where are you going?
Oh, I'm sorry, Jake. I'm gonna have to take a rain check on dessert.
bag me by breakfast? I don't think so, slick.
by the way, what is it that you really do?
I'm assistant manager at Blockbuster.
Yeah, that would have been my second guess.
thanks for a lovely evening.
that was our waiter. What's wrong with him? He looks really bad.
food poisoning. I wouldn't recommend eating anything out of this kitchen.
we already did.
nightingale.
so what do you really do for a living?
I kill zombies.
Ellis: So...
what were you doing here, Nightingale?
what do you think?
well, if I knew that, I wouldn't be asking now, would I?
if you must know, I was on a date.
you on a date.
I don't believe It.
how many times I ask you out and you always said no?
cause you're a pig, Ellis. - I'm not a pig. Tom...
was a pig.
was?
he was killed last week.
at least I was the one to plant him.
God, Ellis, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to say.
don't say anything.
he went down fighting, both times.
he liked it that way.
we've all lost people we love.
won't be the first and certainly won't be the last.
you know, I always kinda thought you had a thing for him.
like hell I did. No offense.
none taken.
so where are we off to?
mobile unit, outside Sunnydale.
setting up for a major op. Casper will fill you in.
I'm just supposed to come fetch.
more hyper-sapiens?
what do you think?
we've lost contact with our forward recon patrols.
but before we did, they confirmed a stage one outbreak at a university campus.
Cuesta Verde... It's not far from here.
there could be some survivors. The truth is we don't know yet.
what we do know based on the analysis of the vectoring of the disease
is that It could be our grand zero for infection.
first generation? - We won't know till you can get us a sample. You'll go in with Special Forces, find any survivors, and retrieve a blood sample from the hyper-sapiens before cruise misslles destroy the entire area at 0700.
now as much as we'd like to keep a lid on this thing, we won't be able to for much longer. And I don't need to tell you what will happen if "60 Minutes" gets a hold of this story.
we don't need Special Forces for this op, sir.
AMS can handle it alone.
man #4: AMS cannot handle It alone.
says who?
says me, kiddo. - That's "sir" to you, Sergeant-Major.
I'm taking you and your men on this mission as a courtesy.
not an obligation.
get in my way, you won't just be studying the dead, you'll be joining them.
understood, sir?
gentlemen, this mission is too important for dick-waving.
I resent that, Colonel.
this is how it's gonna work. AMS will lead the science team, but you're under the jurisdiction of the Special Forces.
now as you know, AMS is an international organization.
they want this op under the strictest US operational command.
these instructions came to me directly from the Secretary of Defense.
from him from the Chiefs of Staff, and to him from the President, as instructed personally by the Vice President himself. Now as such,
I expect all of you to work and play well together and do your country proud.
Yeah, sure, whatever you say, boss.
nightingale, you're in command of the science team.
sergeant Dalton will oversee the Special Forces.
you and Ellis will answer to him. Am I understood?
understood, sir. - Understood, sir.
sergeant Dalton. - Got ya, Colonel.
nightingale, find a blood sample. I want those things eradicated.
and why don't you get cleaned up first? You look like shit.
I am so ready to get some payback on these fuckers.
what about you, Braxton?
as long as my favorite uncle's checks don't bounce,
I go where Sam sends me.
all I know is, why couldn't one of them be my ex-wife?
I mean, I would love permission to shoot her in the fucking head.
do we really need all this shit, I mean, really?
body armor makes my face look fat.
that would be affirmative, Private.
what, so you never seen a woman in her underwear before, Private?
trust me, that's the last thing you'll be thinking about come morning.
of course, this is assuming that you make it till morning, which I gotta say ain't looking very likely.
leave him alone. - Whatever.
just making conversation, Lieutenant.
you ever get the feeling that those AMS greenhorns - don't like us very much. - Nobody likes you, Bart.
how'd we end up babysitting these stuck-up sons of bitches?
Hey, I'll take all the backup I can get.
from the GI Joes?
they're soldiers. They're trained for combat.
they're trained to fight other people, other soldiers.
not these things.
we're trained to fight, period, and we've got your back.
just make sure you got ours, and maybe we'll all get to grow old one day.
or in your case, older.
she digs me.
way to win friends and influence people, Ellis.
I just don't think we need 'em. That's all.
and I say we do.
what, you got an inferiority complex now?
we start off as scientists, researchers, not soldiers.
Hey, speak for yourself.
I came here from Secret Service, not Health and Human Resources, like you. I was never a desk jockey.
I was always a fighter, not to mention a lover.
this war isn't about you, Ellis.
it's about us versus nature.
if nature wins, we're all fucked.
keep giving speeches, Nightingale. That's what you're good at.
rally the troops, "nothing to fear but fear itself..."
that kind of thing. It suits you.
I kinda like it. Gets me all hard and shit.
you just love the sound of your own voice, don't you?
pretty much, yeah.
who's the new blood?
Rodriguez... just transferred in.
replacing Garza. Also demolition expert.
well, I hope she lasts longer than he did, 'cause I would miss that ass.
I mean, when he got scragged, it was no big loss.
but her.
now that is a booty call that I would not mind making.
are you an asshole all the time, Bart?
or do you take Sundays off for good behavior?
Hey, welcome to the team.
I'm Allison Henson.
private Rodriguez, Lieutenant.
you can save the "Lieutenant" stuff for the parade ground.
in here just call me Allison.
I'm Maria.
so I saw you talking to those AMS guys back there.
what were they saying?
basically that we can't hack it.
can't wait to prove them wrong.
fuck them. When it turns into a "shit hit the fan" situation, they'll be hiding behind our pantyhose just like all the rest of those fucking science types.
science types?
Yeah, that's what Bart calls people who can read.
come on, let's roll out!
come on, come on, come on, ladies.
come on, come on.
Dalton: Hecht, HIII, you stay in the van in case we run an Oxy-12 set. Stay with the radio.
everyone else move out! Come on, let's go, let's go!
Ellis: So your men as good as they think they are, Sergeant-Major?
that's right, kiddo.
ever been in combat with these creatures?
they've been trained well.
so they've never actually been in a firefight with these things.
they don't know what it's like to look one in the eye and pull the trigger, do they?
what, are you kidding me? My team's been to hell and back.
bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq. You name it, we've been there.
so when a six-year-old girl dressed in what's left of her Sunday finest comes at 'em ready to take a bite out of 'em like they're a quarter-pounder, you're telling me they're not gonna hesitate.
they're gonna pull the trigger and do what needs to be done?
like I said, been there, done that.
now if you don't mind, we got work to do.
I don't like this, Nightingale.
I don't like this one bit.
these gung-ho marines are gonna get us killed... or worse.
what are you saying, Ellis?
watch my back. That's all I'm saying.
are you scared?
just rather not end up like my brother.
thought you of all people might be able to appreciate that...
nightingale.
I think they're gone. Don't you?
probably moved on.
we're not gonna find any hyper-sapiens here.
Nope.
too late.
missed all the action, which is too bad 'cause I was hoping for a medal out of this.
you hard as woodpecker lips, huh?
the only medal you're getting is a Purple Heart.
and it ain't gonna be for bravery.
what the hell?
hold on a second, Sergeant-Major.
what are they doing?
DNA scanner, analyzes their blood.
I'll get 'em plenty of blood to analyze if they need it.
third generation, worthless.
look at this.
what is it?
you ever seen teeth Iike that on one of them?
no, I haven't. - Neither have I.
it could be they're mutating.
that's not good, is it, Nightingale?
no.
move on out. Come on, let's go!
not afraid of the dark, are you, newbie?
not if you're close.
Oh, shit!
what the hell is that? - Nothing, Sarge.
don't worry about it. It's just a scratch. It's all right.
it's a bite. You've been bitten.
no it's not. I'm all right. - He's been bitten.
we'll have to put that arm in a tourniquet, soldier.
you have to do more than that. - Medic.
nakagawa's been injured. Need to put his arm in a tourniquet, stat.
I'm on it, sir. - Alex: Jesus, Dalton.
you can't put a Band-Aid on an infection.
he's a dead man walking. He just doesn't know it yet.
hey hey hey. - What do you think you're doing, kiddo?
what do you think she's doing?
it's the right thing to do.
we can take care of our own. Grab him.
Sarge? Sarge, what are you doing?
no, Sarge, no! No, Sarge, no!
what the hell are you doing?
stand down, soldier! - No!
No!
sorry, no choice, soldier.
I told you. We take care of our own.
no no no no. - Sorry, doc.
Dalton to base. We lost Nakagawa and Braxton in a firefight with the hyper-sapiens, over.
hill: Copy that. HIII out.
hill, I need you and Hecht down here to police these bodies, stat.
let's go, ladies. Campus is right over the hill. Let's go.
get 'em all? Maybe we got 'em all.
not fucking likely.
all right, listen up. I want a full sweep of the perimeter.
there could be survivors.
all right, you guys, stay out of the shadows, all right?
keep in plain sight. We're gonna be fine.
Bart, you take Henson and Rodriguez to the dormitories.
gotcha. - O'Connor, Griffin, on point with me.
Ellis and Nightingale, do whatever the hell you want. Just don't get yourselves killed.
it'll mean lots of paperwork, and I hate fucking paperwork.
all right, come on, let's go, guys.
what is it?
looks like a fraternity ring.
might be valuable. - You're joking, right?
does it look like I'm joking?
hello.
well, I'm sorry, darling.
John can't come to the phone right now.
he's dead.
can you hear me now?
come on, let's go.
what the hell's that smell?
Bart: They don't all use us for bite, you know?
sometimes they use us for dinner.
I can see that.
all protein and no carbs.
you don't have the stomach for this, Rodriguez?
must be something I ate.
you mean more Iike something they ate.
come on now, take it like a man.
leave her alone, Bart.
I can take care of myself, Lieutenant.
whatever you say, Private.
you girls ready?
empty.
I think we took 'em all out.
we did it, man. We did it.
O'Connor, kill that chatter. Let's fan out.
all the buildings are connected with subterranean tunnels.
this entire university is honeycombed with 'em.
we don't need to lock this place down.
we just need to find your hypersapien and get the hell out of Dodge.
Alex: Well, this certainly explains how the hyper-saplens have been getting around.
they've been following the same patterns, habits that they had while they were still alive.
except with a much bigger appetite.
clear!
clear! Man, I love books.
Anton Chekhov, Fyodor Dostoyevsky,
Judy Blume. You know what I was reading?
Insane's the New Sexy.
give it a rest, man. - Hey, did you name your weapon?
you should 'cause it's your best friend out here.
my weapon's name is Sophie, Sophie Steen.
O'Connor, can it. - My sidearm's name is Tough Love.
enough, O'Connor. I got it.
Ho-ho-holy shit.
we got a survivor.
we don't know that. Could be one of them.
Hey, zombies don't read.
and they ain't hooked on phonics. So give it a rest.
Hey, kid.
he's got headphones on. - Hey, kid, can you hear me?
come on, kid, you're pissing me off.
careful.
O'Connor, this ain't my first rodeo.
and zombies don't read. Unbelievable.
come on, kid.
fucking zombie geek.
Shh!
son of a...
sorry about the noise.
let's move out. Form on me.
come on! Let's go before them bombs start dropping.
voices, survivors.
Hello, can you hear me in there?
Hey, you crummy teens, open the fucking door!
we're coming in. Stay down.
man on radio: It sounds to me that you were a Iittle underwhelming - In the sack... - Henson: Shit.
God, I can't believe this is happening.
Oh, don't go all girlie on me now.
Jesus Christ, it's like you two haven't seen a dead body before.
what the hell are you doing, Bart?
well, it seems that our unfortunate friend here was named Guy Woodhouse.
I guess he won't have to worry about finals anymore.
Adios, Senor Woodhouse. - Wow.
look here.
I don't want this.
I'm not giving it to you.
I just want you to take a picture.
picture of what?
of me...
and my new girlfriend.
okay? Go ahead.
we're ready. - Ready for what?
Oh, hey.
take the picture. - No fucking way.
Oh, fine!
I'll do It. - Don't you dare.
you know, I bet she was a looker when she was alive.
right? I mean, she's not too bad now, either.
I'd stick my dick in her, but I'm afraid of what would happen.
you're fucking disgusting.
you don't look fat, okay?
we really make a nice couple.
don't you think?
clear.
O'Connor.
O'Connor.
second generation.
close but no cigar.
doesn't mean anything. - We'll see.
I know it's not very scientific, but I follow my nose.
and my nose tells me we're getting close.
you sure you could develop a serum from this.
not me.
I'm just a grunt like you, but AMS has some pretty brilliant minds working for 'em, like Nightingale here.
they believe if they can get the DNA from a first generation zombie, generation zero, they can create an antibody.
that way we can stop playing catch-up and actually end this plague, - once and for all. - It's no different from whooping cough or smallpox.
really, it's just a matter of inoculating people against it.
if we're lucky, the zombie plague will end up as a footnote in the history books.
no worse than AIDS or bubonic plague.
Yeah, if it's all the same to you, Nightingale,
I'd rather you not refer to Tom as a footnote.
he lost his brother on a mission last week.
Yeah, well, we all lose people.
Yeah, but you're people don't usually get back up and take a bite out of you after they die.
careful.
you can infect yourself.
you sure as hell wouldn't want that, would you?
no, we wouldn't.
although if I did have to eat anyone,
I'd definitely pick you, kiddo.
don't worry.
if you die, I'll be sure to shoot you in the head before you get to.
that's too bad. A tight ass like you, probably enjoy being eaten by me.
say cheese.
don't you think we should continue looking for survivors, sir?
Absolutely.
but first, Lieutenant Henson, don't you want your Kodak moment with them?
Henson: That's all right. I think I'll take a pass.
well, it's your call, but I gotta tell ya.
I think you'd make a mint with these things on eBay.
I'm wondering about something. - What is it?
if these two were locked up in here, and there's no sign of forced entry, - how'd she get infected? - That's a good question.
and my answer to that is, who gives a fuck?
but if she didn't have contact with another person my worry is could the infection have gone airborne?
AMS said there's no sign of the infection being spread airborne.
AMS has their heads up their asses, okay?
that's why we do their dirty work for them.
I mean, if they knew what they were doing, they would have invented a vaccine by now and they would have had a full containment unit on this thing.
I'm just saying... - Ow!
what is it? - Bart: It's a...
it's nothing. It's just a...
mosquito bite, I think. - No way.
Oh, shit.
Sarge, I think I heard something.
keep it moving, soldier.
Sarge, somebody's up there.
stow that shit and keep moving.
Sarge, somebody's up there!
shit.
Hey, hey, wait up!
Hey, wait.
hello.
hello.
I know you're in here. You don't have to be afraid.
I'm coming to get you out. It's gonna be all right, okay?
I'm gonna get you right out of here.
it's gonna be okay. Gonna get you home.
you'll be all right. It's gonna be all over.
fuck.
Oh God.
what are we gonna do? We can't just leave him here.
can't take him with us. - You gotta take me back to base camp.
he could turn at any time.
maybe they found the zero sample, you know?
maybe they can... - What? Do what, cure you?
you know that's not gonna happen. - Maybe it can't be transmitted by mosquitoes.
maybe it was something else.
maybe they were already infected before they came into the room.
can't take that chance, Bart.
here. - What's this for?
you know what it's for.
use it.
soon as you start to feel the change coming.
what, are you insane?
I'm not gonna fucking kill myself. - Then I'll do it for you.
put the gun down!
you gotta take me with you.
you can't leave me here.
listen, Bart, you're endangering our entire mission.
we're wasting time.
I'll give you each a half a million dollars if you take me with you.
that's $500, 000 apiece.
huh?
what do you say, Rodriguez?
pretty young thing like you.
you don't want to live your whole life on the crap that Uncle Sam doles out to grunts like us, do you?
500, 000 bucks can buy a lot of shit.
you could be living it up Robin Leach style.
where you gonna get that kind of money?
pharmaceutical company.
if we get that zero matter to them before AMS, they're gonna pay us millions.
I mean, can you imagine what the patent on this drug is gonna be worth?
how much Goldman is gonna be willing to pay?
Dalton is in it with me.
you too can be in it with us, too.
there's gonna be enough to go around for everybody.
private, what the hell are you doing?
you can't be serious. - Hell yeah.
have you looked at your paycheck lately?
sounds like a good deal to me.
never underestimate the power of human greed, - Lieutenant Henson.
you didn't think I'd sell out our country for this piece of shit, - did you? - I should have known better.
what are we gonna do with him, madam?
we are gonna let him rot here with the rest of 'em.
Where's Griffin? - He was right behind us.
was, not anymore.
man, I told him to keep up.
gotta mo... shit.
Jesus.
look at this.
they must have lured the zombies into the cage, - got bitten in the process. - Shot themselves before they turned.
smart.
they can smell us.
this cage isn't gonna hold 'em forever.
we should get the hell out of here.
remember, I give the orders. - Go ahead.
order away.
this cage ain't gonna hold 'em forever.
let's move out of here. Let's get moving, come on.
ugly son of a bitch.
nightingale, get down!
I'm okay. I'm okay.
no, you're not. You're infected. - I'm okay. I'm o... okay.
he's turning. - No, I'm not turning.
I'm... I'm fine. - Ellis: Dalton, stay back.
O'Connor!
stay back, Sarge! - Stand down.
I don't wanna do this.
you are being such a good boy.
would you like some more cereal, sweetheart? Here you go.
he's really being a monster again today.
Trudy, goddamn it, help me.
can't you be more careful?
l'm doing the best l can. He's out of control.
sit still. Stop it!
please hold him.
don't do that. Stop kicking!
why can't you be more like your brother?
be quiet!
shut up!
there's a place in Tribeca for 3000.
that's too expensive. The money l saved up won't cover two months' rent.
l'm gonna have to work every second l'm not in class until graduation.
Carly, don't even think about not going. -- l'm not.
good. Because you know how proud l am of you.
lt's just an internship. -- At InStyle magazine.
or would you rather stay at the Waffle House as a waitress forever?
no, thanks. -- Yeah.
Hey, babe. -- Hi.
sorry, there were these two drunk rednecks wrestling in the bathroom.
Really? -- There's no rednecks in New York.
no. There's not.
l'm gonna go see what Blake's doing.
he seems to like that car more than me nowadays.
now that we have a second -- And l'm not trying to make this a big deal.
you know l want to have a good time on our road trip this weekend.
but why on earth did your brother have to come with us?
you said your parents weren't gonna post his bail anymore.
they didn't. Blake did. He invited him.
l guess Nick makes him feel more badass, l don't know.
Blake. -- What up, Paige?
fine.
baby, come back here.
you know it ain't like that.
l was messing with the GPS, and l saw a shortcut.
l think it'll save us an hour.
so we can spend more time...
okay?
how you doing? Hello.
what's up, crow man? --Get a job.
that's nice. Yeah.
here you go.
so, what do you think, guys? Gonna be a sweet game tomorrow, huh?
Yeah.
dalton, please don't film me. --What?
l'm not filming now. --The red light's on.
put the camera down. She doesn't like having people up in her face.
she folds under pressure. -- You got something to say to me?
no, l think you've already spoken enough for the both of us, don't you?
you guys are lame. l'm out of here. See you.
dalton, put down that damn camera.
God.
record crowds are expected for college football's biggest game of the year...
...as Louisiana and Florida... -- lt's gonna be packed tomorrow.
speaking of packed, my legs are killing me back here, man.
don't worry, man, it's not Wade's fault his little Hot Wheels car only fits two.
lt's more like a " shot wheels " car, isn't it?
what did you do, go to the barber shop and ask for a He-Man haircut?
shut up, Dalton.
dude.
you hurt me.
what the hell is this? --Oh, man.
this sucks. -- So much for his nice little shortcut.
l hope he's not gonna get us lost.
Yeah, right. -- Yeah.
Damn! Yo, yo, wake up. Wake up.
Oh, my God.
look at her. Look at her!
you're caught on tape. -- Hello!
Oh, my God! What are they doing?
ls she flossing herself with that thing? -- What are you doing?
look at his face. -- She's calling me.
he's blushing. --You are so busted.
lip balm. l dropped my stupid lip balm. -- She dropped her lip balm.
Yeah. -- Yeah, right.
you dropped your lip balm.
so, what's up? -- lt's getting late.
what do you wanna do? -- Keep going, we don't even have tickets.
there's gonna be a million scalpers there.
lf we keep driving, there's no way l'll stay up for the game.
why don't we just camp out? We're close enough.
Yeah, let's just pull over here. Come on. We'll wake up early.
Yeah, all right. -- All right, we're pulling over.
all right.
Hey, wax museum.
you like that kind of stuff, Wade? -- Yeah, l don't know. Sometimes.
l guess if you like things pretending to be other things.
which you obviously do. Right, sis?
where are we going, Blake? -- l'm just looking for some privacy.
we made it.
nice.
you like it, right? -This is great.
your car sucks, dude.
Paige, come with me. -- Wade, you gotta get a bigger car.
well? -- l couldn't.
there's no point in freaking him out right now.
as opposed to when you find out you are pregnant?
Carly, l'm not sure, okay?
l think you should have a conversation with him.
he's been looking forward to this game for months.
l don't wanna ruin it by starting a fight.
Paige, he's not gonna marry you. His parents won't let him.
who says l want to get married? Besides, l've been late before.
when l know for sure, l promise to talk to him, okay?
let's go.
there are ticks out here.
Yeah, don't help us or nothing.
let's set up. -- Oh, yeah.
pass it! Pass it!
you don't wanna... Too slow, too slow!
Blake. -- Come on.
Touchdown!
nice arm.
l see why they gave you a scholarship.
Yeah, it's a real tragedy, ain't it?
Yeah, it is.
Wade. Help Dalton, okay?
please?
Bye, Wade. -- Asshole.
you can be a prick to me, that's fine. But he didn't do anything to you.
so you admit that you did something.
l admit, according to you, l did something, sure.
you dimed me out. -- l did not dime you out.
when the sheriffs asked where you got the car, l said l didn't know.
l didn't even know it was stolen. You're blaming that on me?
you could have covered for me, huh?
you get caught stealing, it's my fault.
you're resisting arrest, and it's the cop's fault.
he took a swing at me.
get kicked off the football team, it's the coach's fault.
mom and Dad kick you out of the house, it's their fault.
you can't keep a job for two weeks, it's every manager's fault.
l'm surrounded by idiots.
so why did you come? To piss me off?
don't you get it?
you're the good twin.
l'm the evil one.
grow up. You are so afraid to take things seriously.
Yeah. As afraid as Wade is of leaving good old Gainesville?
new York City. Well, l hear they got buildings as tall as the sky.
okay.
blue 42! Hut! Go, go!
what's that smell? -- That's bad.
Oh, my God. -- Dalton, did you crap your pants again?
no. l don't know. Maybe.
l mean, l'm wearing my work clothes, so...
lt's horrible.
something's dead out there. -- No, something's dead right here.
we need to drink it back to life. Bless me, dog.
come on, man.
Hi, pretty Carly.
Hey, what's Wade short for, dude?
who?
what up, Nick? -- Stop.
you gonna do it tonight? -- Screw off.
stop. -- What? Come on, you know you want it.
come on, man. You don't gotta spray it at me, dude.
look at that. -- Keeps messing around.
God, dude.
dalton, what did l say? -- All right, my bad, my bad. Sorry.
what? No, it's off-- -- You're killing me with this thing.
give me that -- Oh, and the tables turn. -- No, no, no. Come on. Don't
look how cute you are on camera, though. You look good.
l think we might have to do a little makeover.
what do you think? -- He looks like a Smurf.
so why'd you steal that car anyway? l mean, you didn't need to do that.
get that rush, huh?
something like that.
you're coming out. -- l don't know.
lf you don't, l will be so mad.
damn, Paige.
look how good you look. -- Hey.
he looks like Elton John, but more gay.
Elton John is gay? -- You look hot.
yellow is his color. -- lt's in style.
why don't you ever make me that pretty, Carly?
give me my camera. Come on, now.
Oh, yeah, that's good. Let me get some of that action.
that's hot.
don't even think about it. l ain't kissing you, dude.
come on, you know you want to, dude.
just kidding. Psyche. l wouldn't kiss your ass for shit.
yeah?
Hey, yo, man, you need something? -- What does he want?
Hey, can you turn off your lights, please?
okay, this is getting kind of creepy.
Hey, come on, man, get out of here. Nothing to see here. Let's go.
can we help you? -- Maybe we're on his property.
no, we didn't pass a gate. -Hey, man, turn your lights off.
Hello! -- Turn your lights off.
turn them off, or l'm whupping someone's ass.
lt's cool, man.
Oh, my...
what?
Yeah!
that was great. That was great, dude.
my man Nick here's hardcore.
what the hell was that about, huh?
you the man, dude. That was awesome. -Don't encourage him.
come on, he's gone.
l heard something.
lt's probably a serial killer or something.
what are you doing?
you scared me.
what are you doing?
getting you back to bed. Come on. Let's go to sleep.
l heard something. -- Get in that tent.
damn it. Hey, it's 2: 30! Get up!
Wade, Dalton, let's go. We're gonna miss the damn game.
Nick. Get up!
damn.
dude, you see my camera anywhere? -- No, man.
you guys seen my camera? -- Like l give a shit about it.
so you and Wade talk some more? -- We're just in different places right now.
he hasn't given me a guilt trip for going, so l can't give him one for staying.
Oh, my God, there's that smell again.
l think it's coming from over there. -- Yeah, let's go follow the smell.
what? l wanna see what it is.
Why? -- Come on.
what the hell was that?
no way.
are you serious? lt was brand-new.
someone's fucking with me.
l cannot believe you're making me do this.
only you.
come on, it'll be fine. -- l'm gonna throw up.
Oh, my God. l hate you.
are you okay? -- l'm stuck!
Wade! Please help me get out of here!
we're down here!
guys, help us!
guys! Get down here! -- Carly! Carly!
Hey! Hey! -- l can't get out.
l'm here, hold on! Hold on, baby. -- Wade, where are you?
Carly. l'm right here. -- Carly!
here. Grab me, baby. Come on. Come on. l got you. Get up here.
you all right? Oh, man.
there's a roadkill pit down here.
Yeah, that smells about right. -- Baby, you okay?
l got you.
lt's okay.
Hey, is that the truck from last night?
not unless he fixed his headlight.
Hey!
don't you see that?
what is that?
no way.
what are you doing, man?
anyone need a hand?
l'm just fooling.
lt's not real, see?
God.
l found it on the side of the road a few weeks ago.
Oh, my God, are you okay? -- Sorry we took so long.
lt's all right. -- What are you guys doing here?
we were all camping up through those trees.
l have water in here somewhere. God. -- Oh, good.
you guys seen my camera?
are you kidding? -- No.
damn. -- Hey, is there a gas station around here?
well, l got some gas in the truck if-- -- l need a fan belt.
what?
just busted. -- Of course. Perfect.
Bo might have one. Runs a station in Ambrose.
Where's that? -- Fifteen miles up the road.
let's just get one in Baton Rouge. -- Man, there's no way l'm leaving my car.
what if that guy from last night strips it? -You're gonna miss the game, then.
Yeah, well, that's not why l came.
all right, look. l'll run you up to the station.
Kickoff's in a couple hours. -You're already late. You gotta snag tickets.
y'all should just go now. l'll stay with my car.
lt's fine. Get me a fan belt on the way back.
make sure it's a 15-inch. -- Gotcha.
l'll give you a ride.
you serious? -- lf you like.
well, yeah. Yeah. -- That's cool?
Yeah, if it's cool.
l'm going with you. -- Carly, no.
Yes. lt'll be fine. -- All right, let's go.
come on, Paige.
Carly. -What?
l'll leave tickets at will call.
thank you. -- All right. All good, man.
come on, babe.
Oh, it's okay.
come on, baby. So let's get out of here.
man, you're just gonna let them leave like that?
with a guy who throws roadkill in a pit for a living?
you clean shit for a living, Mr. Septic-Tank-Man.
what's the difference?
well, l don't walk through it, that's one.
that's a difference, right?
can you roll the window down, please? -- Yeah.
sorry about that. Truck's seen better days.
do you mind rolling down your window, then?
not at all.
sorry. l kind of get used to the smell.
Really? l don't think l could ever get used to it.
well, you can get used to anything if you're around it long enough.
lf you get them in the early morning before the sun bakes them up...
...they're not so bad.
lf they're fresh, though, l just take them home.
why waste the meat?
are we almost there yet? -- lt's just up the road.
Yep, Ambrose used to be a pretty nice town...
...before the interstate came in.
you like knives.
not really. -- Tools of the trade. You wanna see it?
that's okay.
lt's a bowie. lt's a good knife.
that'll cut through anything.
what's going on? You said there was a town up here.
well, yeah, there is. lt's just around that bend.
l gotta flip my hubs into four-wheel. You mind giving me a hand?
when's the last time that you were here?
what, you don't believe me?
l forgot this way in's washed out, that's all.
we'll walk the rest of the way. You've done enough.
now, why would you want to do that?
look, we wanna walk, okay? Just let us out now.
sure.
well, get out, then.
try and do something nice for someone...
look, it's not like that. We appreciate it. -Yeah, l can tell.
ls he still staring?
Yeah. Just keep walking. -- Oh, like l'm gonna stop.
damn.
now l feel like a real asshole. -- l don't care. That guy was a freak.
dude, it's over.
lt'll move.
lt's not moving.
we'll make the second half. -- l'm not sitting in this.
what do you want me to do? -- We have to go back.
turn around. -- l'm not missing this game.
turn the car around, okay? -- They're waiting for us already.
slow down, speedy. God.
miss Ambrose.
wonder how many teeth you have to have to win that one.
this is kind of nice. -- Yeah.
Oh, wait. Babe, there's a pet store.
Oh, great. -- Come on.
are those puppies? Oh, my God. Look at them.
they're cute. Adorable. Maybe next time. Come on.
come on.
Hello?
Hello?
you see anybody? -- No, nobody.
Hello? -- Hey, it's me. We're heading back.
Really? Why? What happened?
traffic. Did you get that fan belt thing or whatever?
no. There's no one at the gas station. l don't know where we're going right now.
so where do you want us to pick you up?
just head up the road that we got off at for the campsite.
lt's washed out at the end. Call us when you get there.
continuing coverage...
we'll camp in the same place as yesterday, but away from that pet cemetery.
cool. See you then.
there's that house of wax. -- Wade, what about the fan belt?
well, there's no one at the station.
why don't we ask someone in the church. -All right. All right.
let us all bow our heads and say a prayer for our beloved deceased friend.
we should go. -- Yeah.
sorry.
what do we do, just wait out here? -- l don't know.
l feel kind of messed up waiting outside a church for a funeral to end.
Hey, man, sorry about walking in. We didn't know
you shouldn't have walked in.
Yeah, l know. lt's just that we have car trouble. We're not from this town.
we were looking for Bo. He works at the gas station.
you found him.
Really? Well, we need a fan belt.
we were camping up the road and-- -- A fan belt?
Yeah.
you walk in on a funeral for a fucking fan belt?
well, let me just go dump the casket in the ground. l'll be right there.
look, we're sorry. -- Yeah.
that's twice today. l'm an asshole.
let's just go back to the road. -- Hey.
Hey, l'm sorry. You know, someone very special to me passed.
and l didn't mean to take it out on you. -- No, no, no. lt's totally understandable.
l reckon things will wrap up soon.
why don't l meet you guys back at the station in about a half?
that'd be great, if that's okay. -- Yeah.
great.
what?
nothing. Looks like your fan club's gotten a little bigger.
are you serious? -- Yeah. l am serious.
lt's obvious Dalton still has a crush on you.
Oh, my God.
okay, that's three times today. You're an asshole.
let's go see your famous house of wax.
but l'm still your favorite asshole, right?
always.
l don't know what you expect to see in here.
lt is wax. Like, literally.
you're not gonna go in there, are you? -- Yeah.
doesn't " closed " mean " l don't want you in here " ?
relax. l just wanna take a quick look.
what if someone's here? -- Hello?
anyone in here?
see? We're fine.
how cool is this? Everything in here is wax. The floor, the walls.
look at this. This is wax. -- Yeah. Cool. Awesome.
who are these people supposed to be? -- l don't know.
aren't there supposed to be famous people in a wax museum?
l don't recognize this guy.
"Trudy opens House of Wax. "
"Trudy's wax carvings are a hit at the state fair. "
"Trudy and husband are expecting first child. "
since when is a wax sculptor a celebrity?
l don't know. Small town, l guess. -That's right. You like small towns.
l didn't say l wasn't gonna like New York, l just said l haven't made a decision yet.
l still have time, all right?
well, l'd really like you to be there with me.
"Oh, no. There's a fire. Help me, Carly.
l'm melting. My skirt's gonna catch fire. My legs are burned.
cut it out, please. -- You're my hero. "
that's not cool.
Hey, Car. There's a dog for you.
Hey, puppy. You a little wax dog too? What up, dog?
Jesus!
that is cool.
Yeah, laugh it up.
what's a dog doing in here anyway?
another Vincent.
this Vincent guy's quite the artist.
Yeah, l think this Vincent guy needs therapy.
l mean, look how detailed this is. Tell me this doesn't look real.
l don't really care.
l mean, not that it's bad, but everything made out of wax?
don't you think that's a little weird?
those aren't wax.
Oh, whatever.
when do you think the last person was here?
a while, probably.
what? What is it? -- l just saw someone.
lt was probably just a wax thing. --No, no.
lt wasn't a wax thing. lt was moving and it was freaky-looking.
l'll go check it out.
Wade, where are you going? Don't leave me.
Wade, come on. -- Hang here a second.
no. Wait.
what's wrong? -- This place is freaking me out.
calm down. There's no one here. -- Please, l just wanna go.
okay. Okay. We'll go to the station, then.
Oh, dude, l had to pee so bad, man.
come on, dude.
Hey, you guys gonna have sex?
what? -- Because me and Paige are.
so you two go pick them up. -- All right.
Hey, Paige. -- Yeah?
Nick and Dalton are gonna go get them. -- Why? We can go.
Oh, baby. Come on, l'm tired of driving. -- Okay.
why don't you let my man drive.
Really?
you heard him. Move. -- Give me the damn keys.
okay. Very slow. Thank you.
l don't think this is cool, just coming in like this.
what? Look, the door was unlocked.
he said he'd be half an hour, he's been 45 minutes.
l'm sure he won't mind.
you know, if your brother and his yes man hadn't come along...
...we would've fit with Blake. None of this would've happened.
once again, that's not my fault.
l don't understand his beef with me.
l've tried to be cool with him. -- Nick's got beef with everybody.
you just can't take it personally. -Yeah, l guess.
Nick and l always used to stick together, and then when we were in junior high...
...and Nick would get into trouble here and there and our parents would always, like...
...compare us. l was the good twin...
...and Nick was the evil twin, as he likes to say.
he kind of got this image.
he totally played it up as if that's what he had to be or something.
lt's already getting dark. l hate the winter.
he's got everything but a 15-inch.
l'll just have to use a 16-inch.
make it work somehow. -- You plan on stealing that?
no. We didn't know how much longer you were gonna be...
...and, you know, we didn't wanna interrupt again.
l left you money on the counter, but you don't have the right size.
you don't have any 15-inches. -- l do at the house.
l hope you're not getting the wrong idea that we're in here.
no, it's okay.
does that cover it? -- lt's close enough.
why don't we get the one you need? lt's only a couple of blocks.
Yeah, all right. -- You keep fan belts at your house?
l get things delivered there when l'm not here.
lf you wanna hold on to the 1 6, that's fine by me.
no, no, no. lt's okay.
Hey, you mind if l use your restroom real fast?
Oh, up at the house. That one's out of order.
all right.
so is it too late to sign Carly up for that beauty pageant?
now, unfortunately it is, because you would've won hands down.
you went inside? -- Yeah.
Yeah, it was unlocked, so, you know...
everything seems to be unlocked around you, now don't it?
Yeah, people used to come to see it from miles away.
and Trudy was the main... l guess " artist " is the appropriate word.
what about Vincent?
l saw his name on a lot of the work. -- He was one of Trudy's boys.
they still around? -- No, no. lt's a horrible story.
Trudy's husband, Doc Sinclair, he was a doctor in the big city...
...until he got his license revoked for doing surgeries on the side.
stuff that, you know, most doctors wouldn't dare do.
so he moved him and Trudy out here to Ambrose...
...made a fresh start with his medical practice...
...and, you know, Trudy really found her calling with that whole wax-sculpture thing.
lt was her dream to do something really incredible here.
and then she had a couple kids, picket fence.
what's horrible about that? -- Yeah.
Trudy got a cyst in her brain. She just started rotting away.
couldn't work no more, and she went crazy.
things got so bad that Doc Sinclair finally had to strap her to the bed.
the whole town could hear her screaming.
Dr. Sinclair was so depressed that he couldn't save her...
...he blew his head right off. -- That's terrible.
lt was worse for the boys, left alone like that.
they both ended up in foster homes.
Hey, why don't you two hop in.
l'll go get the fan belt, and l'll give you a ride to your car.
no, actually, we've got friends picking us up where the road's washed out.
l'll give you a lift. Least l could do for making y'all wait.
cool. -- All right.
Hey, you need to use the facilities, right? -- Yeah. Thanks.
need to use the can? -- No, it's okay. l'm fine.
all right.
so where you heading to anyway? -- We're just going to a football game.
the bathroom is right down the hall.
let me get out of this jacket and tie, and l'll grab your fan belt.
okay. Thanks.
just let me drive, bitch. He gave me the keys, man.
Yeah, because he thinks l'm the one who stole the car and crashed it.
whatever. You didn't have to cover for me, dude.
your jacket's clean, all right? Mine's already got plenty of stains on it.
one more's not gonna make a difference.
where the hell is this place? Town's not even on the GPS.
that's weird.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
l'm in here!
Hello? l'm in here.
Hey.
Hello?
hello.
come on.
Hey, it's Blake. You know what to do.
guys, where the hell are you?
remember the truck that came to the campsite last night?
l think we just ran into him.
Where's Wade? -- Oh, he's not out here?
guess he's still in the bathroom, then. l got the fan belt.
you're not in a hurry, are you?
because l wanted to load the truck up with some stuff first.
what are you doing? -- Waiting for Wade.
open the damn door.
this is my truck.
Hey, what is the matter with you?
lf you don't open this door, l'm gonna call the cops.
you're the guy from the campsite.
what are you doing? -- Wade!
get out of the truck. Stop it.
l'm just trying to help you. Give me the keys. Hey. Hey.
stop it, or l'm calling the cops.
so...
...you think Carly and Wade are gonna stay together...
...when she moves to New York?
because she be looking at me sometimes like
dalton, it ain't happening. -What? What do you mean?
and even if it was happening...
...it ain't happening. Nothing personal.
Why? You like me better than Wade, right?
Wade's not so bad.
D'VONTRAY: Deep-fried shrimp. And lobster.
I never had lobster.
whatever, boil or grill?
which one's better?
uh...just get them both.
and I know I need a strawberry malt whisky.
and then there's those chocolate donuts that come in a box.
warden: We'll do our best to accommodate.
tomorrow you'll be moved to a holding cell.
that's where you'll get your last meal.
you also have a constitutional right to a spiritual advisor of your choice.
no, I don't need none of that.
one last thing to think about.
after I read the execution warrant, you'll be given an opportunity to make a statement.
you might wanna take some time and think about what you wanna say as your final words.
D'VONTRAY: Yo, Clarence? You hear that?
a spiritual advisor of my choice.
don't matter, you're going to hell anyway.
you think I'll get another stay?
you should.
supreme Court said it ain't right to kill retards.
guard: Cut the chatter!
exercise time.
be back in an hour.
guard: Enjoy.
huh? What?
why did you hit me so many times, Clarence?
you know why!
you could have stopped.
you stabbed me in the back, man.
look, I never...
you couldn't fight fair?
like you did?
I had a wife and three kids.
you were a sick bastard! Open the door! Open the door!
Hey!
What'd I ever do to you, man?
Carlos: You better stay in this place.
EMMITT: I was just minding my own business.
how could you did that to me?
I'm your brother.
I never meant to ...
you can't go in there.
who are you? And why are you wearing a tie?
I'm Dr. Cuddy's new assistant.
can I tell her what it's regarding?
Yes. I would like to know why she gets a secretary and I don't.
I'm her assistant, not her secretary.
I graduated from Rutgers.
eh, I didn't know they had a secretarial school.
well, I hope you took some classes in sexual harassment law.
does the word "ka-ching" mean anything to you?
I'm going in now.
Dr. House, we are in the middle of a meeting.
what's with hiring a male secretary?
J-Date not working out?
he is cute, be careful.
she's not like you, she can't just walk into a bar and pick up her soul mate in 20 minutes.
I met Mark at a fundraiser that happened to be held at a...
you met me at a strip club.
you were the worst $2 I've ever spent.
we'll catch up later.
Stacy, it's House. I know you can handle it.
nothing to handle.
he obviously wants to talk to you alone.
CUDDY: If you have a problem working with Stacy, you should have said so.
what was I supposed to do?
ask her to leave? That's just rude.
death row guy. I want the case.
how do you even know about him?
you don't have access to the hospital's mainframe.
no, but "partypants" does.
you stole my password?
hardly counts as stealing, it's a pretty obvious choice.
well, I have already assigned Death Row Guy to Dr. Nolo.
Nolo? Well, I...
I don't wanna say anything bad about another doctor, especially a useless drunk.
you are addicted to pain pills.
Yeah, but I'm not useless. Tell Nolo I'm taking over.
Dr. Nolo is a board certified cardiologist.
Oh, good. I'm sure he'll explore all the usual options for why a guy's heart starts beating so fast it pumps out air instead of blood.
wait a second. There are no usual options.
how badly do you want this?
I will give you two more clinic hours this week.
don't bend over for the soap.
just the heart, or the patient have any other complaints?
patient is not talking to anybody.
where are we going?
you are going to the clinic for two hours.
me? Why?
talk to Cuddy.
she's got me going to Mercer State Prison, Capital Sentences Unit.
I don't know.
aren't there better ways to spend our time?
good question.
what makes a person deserving?
is a man who cheats on his wife more deserving than a man who kills his wife?
uh...yeah, actually, he is.
what about a child molester?
certainly not a good guy, but he didn't kill anybody.
maybe he can get antibiotics, but no MRIs.
what about you?
what medical care should you be denied for being a car thief?
tell you what. Three of you work on a list of...
what medical treatments a person loses based on the crime they committed.
I'll review it when I get back.
your patient shanked one inmate his first month here.
broke another one's neck.
nearly decapitated one of my guards...
relax. I got a great bedside manner.
too dangerous to house him in the infirmary.
you don't have to worry, we've taken every precaution.
I've had my men clear from the cell all pens, paper clips, and staplers.
any supplies that might be used as a weapon.
open her up!
warden: For your visit, we've got him cuffed and shackled.
and yet you're staying out there.
Uhp! You're gonna have to give me that.
wouldn't want anybody to get hurt.
Hi. - Hi. - I'm Dr. Cameron.
how you feeling?
eh. Little cough, no big deal.
okay, then what you doing here?
I just got a job at the university, they need a health clearance.
apparently, I'm a little anemic, so they made me get some more tests.
any family history of anemia?
not that I know of.
my mom died of cancer when I was a kid.
my dad's heart gave out a couple of years ago.
brothers and sisters?
I'm afraid it's a short family history. That's it.
I had a husband once, but...didn't stick.
my tests should be back, probably in that file.
probably.
is everything okay?
wilson: Did you redo the x-ray?
twice.
well, you don't need a consult.
you know the diagnosis.
all she has is a cough.
bluish tinge to the fingernails, Lips.
he's hypoxic.
what's that mean?
it means he's not getting enough oxygen.
you know how people say you can't live without love?
well, oxygen's even more important.
he's got fluid in his lungs.
breathing rate of 50.
he needs to be intubated, put on a respirator.
don't have a respirator.
better get one in about an hour, or you're gonna lose him.
I'll make out a requisition.
state's already sentenced this man to die.
I think the state was a tad more specific about how.
this is Dr. Gregory House.
I need an ambulance pick-up at Mercer State Prison.
wasted call, my men will stop them at the gate.
no way a death row inmate leaves my prison.
at least not through the front doors.
you work fast.
so do you.
was that a shock?
Yeah.
it was easy, once I convinced the clerk to take it to Judge Markham.
she's a sucker for Eighth Amendment arguments.
stop, I'm getting turned on.
Ruh-roh!
it was just a consult!
you expect us to shut down an entire floor for this guy?
did you do something to your hair?
you said you cleared it with her.
come on, you've known me how long?
and you still can't tell when I'm joshing you?
take him back to prison. Now.
no, can't.
see, ironically,
I'm bound by this court order that your ace attorney got.
I have to make him all better before shipping him back for the state to kill him.
is it just me, or is that weird?
anyway, we're walking.
somebody left this on my chair.
it's clever, cause it forces me to either deal with the file or never sit down again.
Cindy Kramer. I told her you'd see her.
well, you shouldn't have told her that.
she's got metastatic squamous cell lung cancer.
six months tops.
have you even looked at the x-ray?
no. Just guessing.
it's a new game. If I'm wrong, she wins a stuffed bear.
a spot on an x-ray doesn't necessarily mean that she's terminal.
I love children. So filled with hope.
it could be pneumonia. It could be sarcoidosis.
could be.
if she didn't already have swollen hilar lymph nodes on the other lung.
can we at least brainstorm for other ideas?
thank you.
I still think pneumonia and sarcoidosis.
but we should check for tuberculosis and definitely rule out congestive heart failure.
five stages of dying.
exactly.
personally, I think it's all just New Age crap, but from your tear-filled, puppy dog eyes,
I think I've made my point.
now go tell Cindy that she's dying.
tachycardia. Pulmonary edema. Likely suspects?
the death row guy?
that's who you're working on instead of Cindy?
God, I've got to learn not to beat around the bush.
by dying, I meant no matter what we do.
very, very soon ，she is going to be dead.
is that still too subtle?
I took an oath to Do No Harm.
Yeah, but it's not like they make you sign it or anything.
we cure your patient, he goes back to death row.
he goes back to death row, they kill him.
he stays here and we don't treat him, he dies.
and I still don't treat Cindy Lou Who.
can we get on with this?
Yeah, I knew I could count on your help for your homie.
exactly. I'm black.
I sympathize with guys who grew up in the inner city, kept down by The Man.
makes sense to me.
it's a bunch of crap!
you can't blame society for the fact that you chose to become a killer.
the guy's probably a heroin addict.
that explains the tachycardia, which caused the pulmonary edema.
how does an inmate on death row get his hands on heroin?
are you serious?
house: Man knows prisons.
when we got a yachting question, we'll come to you.
okay, drugs it is.
test his hair, blood, urine, works.
thanks for getting my back.
I thought you seminary boys were against the death penalty.
I've left the seminary.
over their stance on capital punishment?
I'm against the death penalty in principle.
in practice, however, watching a murderer die causes me a lot less grief than annoying my boss.
we gotta check you out before you go in.
cameron: Department of Justice statistics show that it's a racially motivated form of punishment.
black defendants are 10 times more likely to get a death sentence than whites.
doesn't mean we need to get rid of the death penalty.
just means we need to kill more white people.
it's okay. You're in a hospital, we're taking care of you.
stay calm, you hear me?
push two milligrams Ativan!
water. Water.
what's the differential for being thirsty?
he was just a little dehydrated.
and out of his mind.
we upped his saline drip. He's fine now.
blood and urine tests came back clean, no sign of opiates in his system.
don't do that.
what? You have some House theory explaining heroin use despite a negative test?
Nope.
only I get to write on the board.
so it's not drugs.
what else can cause a heart to do wind sprints?
you got the blood work back, anything out of the ordinary?
his bicarb is low.
Yeah, but which column?
it could be the result of the tachycardia, or it could be the cause.
it's the cause.
why, because you want it to be?
let's see how well that works with your other patient.
we're just talking semantics here.
we should put him on a bicarb drip and send him back.
right. Buff his numbers, don't bother trying to figure out the underlying cause.
I thought you cared about patients.
foreman: Our job isn't to make sure he can bounce his grandkids on his lap.
our job is to get him healthy enough to go back to death row.
our job is to diagnose him.
what?
mommy and Daddy are having a little fight, doesn't mean we've stopped loving you.
now, go outside and play.
get Daddy some smokes, and an arterial blood gas test.
wow,
that was impressive.
okay, what number am I thinking of?
are you trying to get me fired?
if you didn't want me working here, why didn't you just say so?
I just don't want you working right here, in my office.
but anywhere else in the building is fine.
it's a really big hospital.
I'm a lawyer, you're a jerk. There's gonna be some overlap.
God, I hope that was a euphemism.
Cuddy just reamed me.
I hope that one means what I think it means.
for trusting you!
she figured when she hired me she'd at least have someone you couldn't walk all over.
the number was six, by the way.
I need to know, can I trust you?
if I hadn't lied to you about Cuddy's approval, my patient would be dead.
great.
now I know.
now we can work together.
I'll be drawing some blood from your femoral artery.
from my what?
runs through your groin.
you think you're gonna stick me in the jewels with that?
it's really closer to your thigh.
technically at this point, it seems like your jewels are more for display purposes anyway.
hold up, hold up. Gimme some painkillers or something.
a tough guy like you don't need them.
forget that, numb me up, man.
you got some gang ink?
let me see that.
it's a Native American symbol.
it means "the force of life.
that's what you tell all these white dudes so they let you play doctor.
Yup, got them all fooled.
for real, how a brother like you go from gang banging to wearing that white coat?
how's a brother like you go from loving a woman to punching her skull in?
bitch stepped out.
sorry about that.
guess I didn't use enough lidocaine.
blood gas came back with a pH of 7. 28, and decreased HCO3.
which means two things.
most importantly,
cameron was wrong about the bi-carb.
and less significantly, we have a new symptom.
anion gap acidosis.
who's chubby?
come on, pretend he loves puppies.
pretend he's a human being. What do you got?
I think we should reconsider drugs.
he already tested negative.
that's why I said reconsider.
back in juvie, I cut up oregano and sold it as pot.
is that how you put yourself through med school?
what if Clarence thought he was taking heroin, but it was something else?
what something else could lead to anion gap acidosis?
Mudpiles.
well, you don't have to ask, just wash your hands before you come back.
methanol, uremia, diabetes...
Oh, it's a mnemonic. That makes sense, too.
Paraldehyde, INH, Lactic acid...
rewind.
INH?
Yahtzee.
drugs for tuberculosis.
nearly a quarter of the prison population is infected with TB.
clever entrepreneur like Foreman here chops up his meds, passes it off as heroin.
INH poisoning would explain all the symptoms.
who wants to head over to the prison and find Clarence's secret stash?
fine, I'll do it.
great! Chase it is.
I assume you have a reason beyond wanting to make me completely miserable.
you got a prettier mouth.
better chance the inmates will open up to you.
John CLIFT: Perhaps I'll come out looking just as monstrous.
I mean, isn't that what I deserve?
Dr. VIVIAN: John, it wasn't your fault.
if your father hadn't slipped you those drugs, you would have never done...
the man's in a coma!
he didn't mind. I asked.
you're getting crumbs all over him.
why do you think they put TVs in coma patients' rooms, anyway?
some people think they can still hear.
well, so leave them a radio. His eyes are closed.
who thinks they can see?
do you know why people are nice to other people?
Oh, I know this one!
because people are good, decent and caring.
either that, or people are cowards.
if I'm mean to you, you'll be mean to me.
Mutually-assured destruction.
exactly. Are you gonna eat these chips?
are you gonna get to your point?
you need people to like you.
I don't care if people like me.
Yes, but you need people to like you, because you need people.
unless you think you can get the next court order yourself.
if Stacy can't trust you, you can't use her.
and, that's not even dealing with the greater agenda of getting her to dump her husband and fall in love with you all over again.
Dr. BRUCE: We were gonna be with each other forever!
look, I know you're friends with her, but there is a code.
bros before hoes, man.
crap.
what is it?
death row guy is dying.
bradycardia. His heart rate's dropped to 30.
it's not gonna hold out much longer.
you just waiting to call time of death, or are you gonna give him atropine?
temporary fix?
right.
don't know why those diabetics are all hung up on insulin.
they're just gonna have to take more.
Atropine's only gonna buy you a few hours.
we don't even know what's wrong with him.
just get out of here.
this is Chase.
did you beat any confessions out of anybody?
I haven't spoken to any inmates.
does anybody do their jobs anymore?
I decided Clarence's life isn't worth risking mine for.
appreciate your candor.
did you even go to the prison, or are you just out playing polo?
I'm searching both of Clarence's cells.
I figured if he's on something, it's stashed somewhere.
unless he finished it.
Yeah, that'd be a shame.
he could have shoved it anywhere.
there's envelopes stacked to the ceiling, bottles of copier toner, boxes of rubber bands, paper, file folders.
call it off.
come on back.
what's going on?
you're dying.
house: A man deserves a last drink.
you're okay.
Thanks. That means a lot.
all the tests have been inconclusive?
diagnostics is more of an art than a science.
should I be worried right now?
I work for one of the top diagnosticians in the country.
we're pouring all of our energy into figuring this out.
house: I thought you convicts knew how to drink.
you're at least three shots behind.
now you're four shots behind.
you better get me the next one, or I'm gonna kill you.
I was just waiting for test results, I was...
little busy right now. Getting my drink on.
unbelievable.
Oof! That's the finest piece I've seen in 10 years.
I could've hit that.
and you didn't?
eh.
man, you're the one that should be locked up.
tell me something.
I've been trying to figure this out.
why does a guy who's on death row suddenly try to off himself?
I know you drank that copier fluid.
it's not as visually dramatic as slitting your wrists with a homemade shiv, but it will do the trick.
it just hit me all of a sudden.
it was like, they tell me when to eat, when to sleep, when to walk, when to talk, everything.
I had to take control of something, right?
when to die.
I figured that was as good as anything.
and that thought just came to you, just like that?
man, I told you, Twenty-three hours a
Mmm.
look, here's the good news.
the copier fluid you drank contains about 90% methanol, which is very poisonous, and you took more than enough to kill yourself.
the bad news is, the alcohol you just drank contains so much ethanol that it's going to bind with that nasty formic acid rampaging through your body, hence you're just gonna pee it out.
harmlessly.
man, you are drunk.
Yes, I am. I also saved your life.
Shee-ya.
at least for now.
morning!
your head hurts?
no, you just have a very grating voice.
you always were a lightweight.
why are you talking to me?
can't it be enough that I wanna cause you pain?
the patient's okay now, you're gonna send him back?
Absolutely.
can I trust you?
you used to.
I still think the patient's sick. I'm keeping him here.
Yeah. Either you can do your job and keep the hospital informed, or you can help me make sure the hospital is not informed and buy me some time.
chase: Have you done a CT?
Yeah, I have.
contrast?
she's done everything ,she needs to do except tell her patient that she's dying.
I told you, only I get to play with the markers.
our prisoner has a new symptom.
I'm not telling Cindy she's dying until the diagnosis is confirmed.
I'm not buying that Clarence was trying to take control of his life by suicide.
healthy people don't kill themselves.
healthy people don't kill other people.
guy just filed an appeal in a state...
that hasn't actually killed anybody in about 30 years.
what if it wasn't suicide?
what if it was an escape plan?
drink enough methanol to get transferred to a hospital, try to escape from here.
excellent.
explains everything except the symptom that got him here.
his heart went nuts before he got stuck in that storage cell and chugged a toner martini.
I think there's something going on in his head.
check for intracranial lesions, brain infections, autoimmune diseases, do a CT, LP, full workup.
state's paying, so go nuts.
foreman: Where'd you get these scars?
I got shivved my first month in.
after I healed up, I got mines.
you guys still think I'm sick?
obviously.
why do you care?
why don't you just let me die?
I'm different than you.
right. You love me like your own mama.
that's why the nurse says you kicked her out when my heart nearly stopped.
take a deep breath.
any family history of mental illness?
I always heard my pop was crazy, I never met the man.
with my mom, it was the drugs.
any siblings?
I got a brother, pretty much raised him on my own.
inspirational story.
he doing time, too?
hey...
he's a good kid.
don't go judging what you don't know.
how's his health?
I haven't heard from him since I went inside.
spent 16 years with him, changed his damn diapers.
can you imagine your whole life being all about the worst thing you ever did?
you killed four people.
and somehow making mac and cheese just the way he wants kind of loses its significance.
Oh, no.
now you've left your entire body in my chair.
what does that mean you want?
I need a segmental bronchoalveolar lavage.
I take it the CT with contrast came back?
they're not definitive.
biopsy would be.
biopsy would be invasive and unnecessary.
and definitive.
but you don't want definitive, you want to hang onto your delusions as long as you can.
a lavage could prove it's not cancer.
but you need me to approve the procedure. Must be a bitch.
the answer is no.
Why? Because it's me?
I'm over you! I've jumped on the bandwagon.
and I hate you, okay?
great. Let's treat her.
what is it?
you won't help Cindy, but you're obsessed with this piece of dirt!
are you just trying to prove that who someone is doesn't matter, or that all that matters is your stupid puzzle?
fine. Treat them the same, that's all I'm asking.
one test.
wow, that is remarkable.
according to those patchouli oil-selling New Agers, it's supposed to be the terminal patient, but you're going through the five stages.
you just made a completely seamless transition from anger to bargaining.
cover two more of my clinic hours, and you can have your one procedure.
no lesions, no aneurysms.
ironically, the mind of a killer looks completely normal.
if someone asked you to describe me to them, what's the first thing you'd tell them?
insecure.
what are you asking?
like if you were setting me up on a blind date.
would you describe me to the girl as the black guy?
a neurologist?
car thief?
this guy's really getting to you, isn't he?
there's no sign of infection.
you're gonna have to do the biopsy.
CUDDY: Your death row guy's still here.
Yeah, sorry. I've just gotta get him stabilized.
probably keep him on fluids for a few more hours, then off he goes.
Oh, yeah? Cause I'm figuring that you still think he's sick.
figuring requires deductive reasoning.
I'm figuring that you did no figuring.
Stacy just ratted me out, right?
so much for attorney-client privilege.
I'm the client, you moron.
Stacy has a duty to this hospital.
right.
I'm sending him back to prison.
whoa, can't. Court order.
court order says he has to be declared healthy.
doesn't specify which doctor needs to make that declaration.
what is it, Clarence?
my gut!
would you describe it as a shooting pain?
a throbbing pain?
or maybe an imaginary pain because you don't want to go back to prison?
where does it hurt?
my gut, I feel like I'm getting stabbed!
well, he'd know.
let me take a look.
Oh, so everybody lies except a convicted murderer?
I don't think he's faking this stuff.
what do you think, Doctor?
I didn't have any choice.
no, you had to tell Cuddy.
she's your boss, I get it.
Hitler thought he was doing the world a favor, too.
Yeah, pretty much on that same level.
gandhi didn't march to the sea because his buddies asked him to.
pol Pot didn't wipe out the teachers because he wanted to make friends.
you're not making friends right now.
I trusted you.
I know.
Wilson's a fool. I'm an idiot.
I had to do what I thought was right.
it's the only reason anybody does anything.
surgery went fine.
they removed almost a foot of necrotic bowel.
they're shackling him and taking him into recovery.
I wonder.
I wonder why Clarence killed that second inmate?
fine, I'll bite.
what the hell are you talking about?
everything we do is dictated by motive.
why did he kill his girlfriend?
because he's a maniac!
is that the reason he gave?
she was cheating on him.
jealousy.
that gets him sent to prison.
where he kills inmate number one. Why?
guy attacked him first.
revenge.
who'd he kill after that?
prison guard.
who had a file full of abuse complaints.
probably been kicking Clarence's ass for months.
Clarence is just ridding the world of bad seeds.
call that one "retribution
then he kills inmate number two.
anybody know why?
Uh-uh. It's not in there.
CLARENCE: All of a sudden, I gotta have a reason?
it's an anomaly.
doctors love anomalies.
dark spot on an x-ray, bright spot on an MRI.
killing that second inmate was the homicidal equivalent of blood in the urine.
it doesn't fit.
I'm interested in things that don't fit.
tell me why you did it.
your other victims you were almost bragging about.
what was different about this guy?
it happened when I was in gen-pop.
I was in the library, just reading.
and I started feeling real nervous.
this guy was staring at me.
I could feel his eyes digging holes in the back of my neck.
made me feel crazy.
sweat was pouring down my face.
I could hear my heartbeat racing in my ears.
I just raged out on the dude.
so what's the differential for raging out?
excess testosterone, steroids.
Adrenalin?
prep Clarence for surgery.
care to share with the class?
Oh, come on, do I have to spell it out for you?
pheochromocytoma.
actually, I'm not sure how you spell it.
but you said it yourself, adrenalin.
pheochromocytoma sits on top of the adrenal gland, randomly spits out oodles of the stuff.
it's perfect. It explains everything, the tachycardia, pulmonary edema, the vasoconstriction that caused the necrotic bowel.
even explains how he had the strength to rip the rail off his bed.
but pheo's extremely rare.
I love rare.
set up an MRI. Where's Cameron?
like I don't know.
Dr. Cameron, could I borrow you for a consult?
bittersweet thing about being head of the Oncology Department,
I get CCED on all the biopsy results.
Yeah, I know.
she's terminal.
Yeah. So I take it you were in there informing her?
well, I-I hadn't exactly gotten around to that, but I was just
doing what? Making friends?
Cindy's divorced.
she doesn't have any kids, no siblings, both her parents are gone.
it's not your job to be her friend!
do you understand?
and it's not worth it.
she feels better her final few days, and you're not the same, maybe for years.
you don't think it's worth it?
I know it's not worth it.
my husband was
I met him just after he was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.
if I hadn't married him.
he was alone.
when a good person dies, there should be an impact on the world.
somebody should notice.
somebody should be upset.
what?
I don't even remember.
it's just a fancy way of saying small, adrenalin-secreting tumor.
Yeah, that clarified it for you.
all you need to know is, if I'm right, we can fix it.
just gotta find it first.
we need an MRI.
it's completely painless for most people.
but not for me?
I assume you got those tattoos in prison.
prison tats often contain inks with heavy metals.
the MRI is basically a giant magnet, suck those metallic inks right out of your skin.
stop squirming.
don't make us do this again.
big baby.
still don't see anything.
CLARENCE: Turn it off!
there's Waldo.
found it, Clarence.
turn it off!
turn this damn thing off!
keep him in there until you guys see it, too.
son of a bitch.
looks like they got the pheo out successfully.
so, what now?
Clarence goes back to death row.
just like that?
he's cured.
that tumor caused random shots of adrenalin, which obviously led to the rage attacks that made him become a murderer in the first place.
my God, you're right!
let's call the surgeons, we gotta save that tumor.
put it on the witness stand.
we could testify at Clarence's appeal.
you smell that?
I think that is the stink of hypocrisy.
you wouldn't even consider the notion that Clarence's social upbringing was responsible for what he became, but now you're sprinting to the witness stand to blame everything on a little tumor.
a person's upbringing and their biology are completely different.
Yeah. Because you only overcame one of them.
well, let's just give Clarence a free pass, hmmm?
which is probably gonna piss off all those other pheo sufferers who managed to control their rage attacks and become lawyers, race car drivers, or even doctors.
removing that tumor puts a stop to those random shots of adrenalin.
it doesn't absolve him.
you want him to be executed?
that's not what I'm saying.
got an opinion?
everyone's got an opinion.
I, uh, I think I'm gonna testify at Clarence's appeal.
you'll do what you think is right.
on your own time.
but it's just a cough.
D'VONTRAY: Deep-fried shrimp. And lobster.
I never had lobster.
whatever, boil or grill?
which one's better?
uh...just get them both.
and I know I need a strawberry malt whisky.
and then there's those chocolate donuts that come in a box.
warden: We'll do our best to accommodate.
tomorrow you'll be moved to a holding cell.
that's where you'll get your last meal.
you also have a constitutional right to a spiritual advisor of your choice.
no, I don't need none of that.
one last thing to think about.
after I read the execution warrant, you'll be given an opportunity to make a statement.
you might wanna take some time and think about what you wanna say as your final words.
D'VONTRAY: Yo, Clarence? You hear that?
a spiritual advisor of my choice.
don't matter, you're going to hell anyway.
you think I'll get another stay?
you should.
supreme Court said it ain't right to kill retards.
guard: Cut the chatter!
exercise time.
be back in an hour.
guard: Enjoy.
huh? What?
why did you hit me so many times, Clarence?
you know why!
you could have stopped.
you stabbed me in the back, man.
look, I never...
you couldn't fight fair?
like you did?
I had a wife and three kids.
you were a sick bastard! Open the door! Open the door!
Hey!
What'd I ever do to you, man?
Carlos: You better stay in this place.
EMMITT: I was just minding my own business.
how could you did that to me?
I'm your brother.
I never meant to ...
you can't go in there.
who are you? And why are you wearing a tie?
I'm Dr. Cuddy's new assistant.
can I tell her what it's regarding?
Yes. I would like to know why she gets a secretary and I don't.
I'm her assistant, not her secretary.
I graduated from Rutgers.
eh, I didn't know they had a secretarial school.
well, I hope you took some classes in sexual harassment law.
does the word "ka-ching" mean anything to you?
I'm going in now.
Dr. House, we are in the middle of a meeting.
what's with hiring a male secretary?
J-Date not working out?
he is cute, be careful.
she's not like you, she can't just walk into a bar and pick up her soul mate in 20 minutes.
I met Mark at a fundraiser that happened to be held at a...
you met me at a strip club.
you were the worst $2 I've ever spent.
we'll catch up later.
Stacy, it's House. I know you can handle it.
nothing to handle.
he obviously wants to talk to you alone.
CUDDY: If you have a problem working with Stacy, you should have said so.
what was I supposed to do?
ask her to leave? That's just rude.
death row guy. I want the case.
how do you even know about him?
you don't have access to the hospital's mainframe.
no, but "partypants" does.
you stole my password?
hardly counts as stealing, it's a pretty obvious choice.
well, I have already assigned Death Row Guy to Dr. Nolo.
Nolo? Well, I...
I don't wanna say anything bad about another doctor, especially a useless drunk.
you are addicted to pain pills.
Yeah, but I'm not useless. Tell Nolo I'm taking over.
Dr. Nolo is a board certified cardiologist.
Oh, good. I'm sure he'll explore all the usual options for why a guy's heart starts beating so fast it pumps out air instead of blood.
wait a second. There are no usual options.
how badly do you want this?
I will give you two more clinic hours this week.
don't bend over for the soap.
just the heart, or the patient have any other complaints?
patient is not talking to anybody.
where are we going?
you are going to the clinic for two hours.
me? Why?
talk to Cuddy.
she's got me going to Mercer State Prison, Capital Sentences Unit.
I don't know.
aren't there better ways to spend our time?
good question.
what makes a person deserving?
is a man who cheats on his wife more deserving than a man who kills his wife?
uh...yeah, actually, he is.
what about a child molester?
certainly not a good guy, but he didn't kill anybody.
maybe he can get antibiotics, but no MRIs.
what about you?
what medical care should you be denied for being a car thief?
tell you what. Three of you work on a list of...
what medical treatments a person loses based on the crime they committed.
I'll review it when I get back.
your patient shanked one inmate his first month here.
broke another one's neck.
nearly decapitated one of my guards...
relax. I got a great bedside manner.
too dangerous to house him in the infirmary.
you don't have to worry, we've taken every precaution.
I've had my men clear from the cell all pens, paper clips, and staplers.
any supplies that might be used as a weapon.
open her up!
warden: For your visit, we've got him cuffed and shackled.
and yet you're staying out there.
Uhp! You're gonna have to give me that.
wouldn't want anybody to get hurt.
Hi. - Hi. - I'm Dr. Cameron.
how you feeling?
eh. Little cough, no big deal.
okay, then what you doing here?
I just got a job at the university, they need a health clearance.
apparently, I'm a little anemic, so they made me get some more tests.
any family history of anemia?
not that I know of.
my mom died of cancer when I was a kid.
my dad's heart gave out a couple of years ago.
brothers and sisters?
I'm afraid it's a short family history. That's it.
I had a husband once, but...didn't stick.
my tests should be back, probably in that file.
probably.
is everything okay?
wilson: Did you redo the x-ray?
twice.
well, you don't need a consult.
you know the diagnosis.
all she has is a cough.
bluish tinge to the fingernails, Lips.
he's hypoxic.
what's that mean?
it means he's not getting enough oxygen.
you know how people say you can't live without love?
well, oxygen's even more important.
he's got fluid in his lungs.
breathing rate of 50.
he needs to be intubated, put on a respirator.
don't have a respirator.
better get one in about an hour, or you're gonna lose him.
I'll make out a requisition.
state's already sentenced this man to die.
I think the state was a tad more specific about how.
this is Dr. Gregory House.
I need an ambulance pick-up at Mercer State Prison.
wasted call, my men will stop them at the gate.
no way a death row inmate leaves my prison.
at least not through the front doors.
you work fast.
so do you.
was that a shock?
Yeah.
it was easy, once I convinced the clerk to take it to Judge Markham.
she's a sucker for Eighth Amendment arguments.
stop, I'm getting turned on.
Ruh-roh!
it was just a consult!
you expect us to shut down an entire floor for this guy?
did you do something to your hair?
you said you cleared it with her.
come on, you've known me how long?
and you still can't tell when I'm joshing you?
take him back to prison. Now.
no, can't.
see, ironically,
I'm bound by this court order that your ace attorney got.
I have to make him all better before shipping him back for the state to kill him.
is it just me, or is that weird?
anyway, we're walking.
somebody left this on my chair.
it's clever, cause it forces me to either deal with the file or never sit down again.
Cindy Kramer. I told her you'd see her.
well, you shouldn't have told her that.
she's got metastatic squamous cell lung cancer.
six months tops.
have you even looked at the x-ray?
no. Just guessing.
it's a new game. If I'm wrong, she wins a stuffed bear.
a spot on an x-ray doesn't necessarily mean that she's terminal.
I love children. So filled with hope.
it could be pneumonia. It could be sarcoidosis.
could be.
if she didn't already have swollen hilar lymph nodes on the other lung.
can we at least brainstorm for other ideas?
thank you.
I still think pneumonia and sarcoidosis.
but we should check for tuberculosis and definitely rule out congestive heart failure.
five stages of dying.
exactly.
personally, I think it's all just New Age crap, but from your tear-filled, puppy dog eyes,
I think I've made my point.
now go tell Cindy that she's dying.
tachycardia. Pulmonary edema. Likely suspects?
the death row guy?
that's who you're working on instead of Cindy?
God, I've got to learn not to beat around the bush.
by dying, I meant no matter what we do.
very, very soon ，she is going to be dead.
is that still too subtle?
I took an oath to Do No Harm.
Yeah, but it's not like they make you sign it or anything.
we cure your patient, he goes back to death row.
he goes back to death row, they kill him.
he stays here and we don't treat him, he dies.
and I still don't treat Cindy Lou Who.
can we get on with this?
Yeah, I knew I could count on your help for your homie.
exactly. I'm black.
I sympathize with guys who grew up in the inner city, kept down by The Man.
makes sense to me.
it's a bunch of crap!
you can't blame society for the fact that you chose to become a killer.
the guy's probably a heroin addict.
that explains the tachycardia, which caused the pulmonary edema.
how does an inmate on death row get his hands on heroin?
are you serious?
house: Man knows prisons.
when we got a yachting question, we'll come to you.
okay, drugs it is.
test his hair, blood, urine, works.
thanks for getting my back.
I thought you seminary boys were against the death penalty.
I've left the seminary.
over their stance on capital punishment?
I'm against the death penalty in principle.
in practice, however, watching a murderer die causes me a lot less grief than annoying my boss.
we gotta check you out before you go in.
cameron: Department of Justice statistics show that it's a racially motivated form of punishment.
black defendants are 10 times more likely to get a death sentence than whites.
doesn't mean we need to get rid of the death penalty.
just means we need to kill more white people.
it's okay. You're in a hospital, we're taking care of you.
stay calm, you hear me?
push two milligrams Ativan!
water. Water.
what's the differential for being thirsty?
he was just a little dehydrated.
and out of his mind.
we upped his saline drip. He's fine now.
blood and urine tests came back clean, no sign of opiates in his system.
don't do that.
what? You have some House theory explaining heroin use despite a negative test?
Nope.
only I get to write on the board.
so it's not drugs.
what else can cause a heart to do wind sprints?
you got the blood work back, anything out of the ordinary?
his bicarb is low.
Yeah, but which column?
it could be the result of the tachycardia, or it could be the cause.
it's the cause.
why, because you want it to be?
let's see how well that works with your other patient.
we're just talking semantics here.
we should put him on a bicarb drip and send him back.
right. Buff his numbers, don't bother trying to figure out the underlying cause.
I thought you cared about patients.
foreman: Our job isn't to make sure he can bounce his grandkids on his lap.
our job is to get him healthy enough to go back to death row.
our job is to diagnose him.
what?
mommy and Daddy are having a little fight, doesn't mean we've stopped loving you.
now, go outside and play.
get Daddy some smokes, and an arterial blood gas test.
wow,
that was impressive.
okay, what number am I thinking of?
are you trying to get me fired?
if you didn't want me working here, why didn't you just say so?
I just don't want you working right here, in my office.
but anywhere else in the building is fine.
it's a really big hospital.
I'm a lawyer, you're a jerk. There's gonna be some overlap.
God, I hope that was a euphemism.
Cuddy just reamed me.
I hope that one means what I think it means.
for trusting you!
she figured when she hired me she'd at least have someone you couldn't walk all over.
the number was six, by the way.
I need to know, can I trust you?
if I hadn't lied to you about Cuddy's approval, my patient would be dead.
great.
now I know.
now we can work together.
I'll be drawing some blood from your femoral artery.
from my what?
runs through your groin.
you think you're gonna stick me in the jewels with that?
it's really closer to your thigh.
technically at this point, it seems like your jewels are more for display purposes anyway.
hold up, hold up. Gimme some painkillers or something.
a tough guy like you don't need them.
forget that, numb me up, man.
you got some gang ink?
let me see that.
it's a Native American symbol.
it means "the force of life.
that's what you tell all these white dudes so they let you play doctor.
Yup, got them all fooled.
for real, how a brother like you go from gang banging to wearing that white coat?
how's a brother like you go from loving a woman to punching her skull in?
bitch stepped out.
sorry about that.
guess I didn't use enough lidocaine.
blood gas came back with a pH of 7. 28, and decreased HCO3.
which means two things.
most importantly,
cameron was wrong about the bi-carb.
and less significantly, we have a new symptom.
anion gap acidosis.
who's chubby?
come on, pretend he loves puppies.
pretend he's a human being. What do you got?
I think we should reconsider drugs.
he already tested negative.
that's why I said reconsider.
back in juvie, I cut up oregano and sold it as pot.
is that how you put yourself through med school?
what if Clarence thought he was taking heroin, but it was something else?
what something else could lead to anion gap acidosis?
Mudpiles.
well, you don't have to ask, just wash your hands before you come back.
methanol, uremia, diabetes...
Oh, it's a mnemonic. That makes sense, too.
Paraldehyde, INH, Lactic acid...
rewind.
INH?
Yahtzee.
drugs for tuberculosis.
nearly a quarter of the prison population is infected with TB.
clever entrepreneur like Foreman here chops up his meds, passes it off as heroin.
INH poisoning would explain all the symptoms.
who wants to head over to the prison and find Clarence's secret stash?
fine, I'll do it.
great! Chase it is.
I assume you have a reason beyond wanting to make me completely miserable.
you got a prettier mouth.
better chance the inmates will open up to you.
John CLIFT: Perhaps I'll come out looking just as monstrous.
I mean, isn't that what I deserve?
Dr. VIVIAN: John, it wasn't your fault.
if your father hadn't slipped you those drugs, you would have never done...
the man's in a coma!
he didn't mind. I asked.
you're getting crumbs all over him.
why do you think they put TVs in coma patients' rooms, anyway?
some people think they can still hear.
well, so leave them a radio. His eyes are closed.
who thinks they can see?
do you know why people are nice to other people?
Oh, I know this one!
because people are good, decent and caring.
either that, or people are cowards.
if I'm mean to you, you'll be mean to me.
Mutually-assured destruction.
exactly. Are you gonna eat these chips?
are you gonna get to your point?
you need people to like you.
I don't care if people like me.
Yes, but you need people to like you, because you need people.
unless you think you can get the next court order yourself.
if Stacy can't trust you, you can't use her.
and, that's not even dealing with the greater agenda of getting her to dump her husband and fall in love with you all over again.
Dr. BRUCE: We were gonna be with each other forever!
look, I know you're friends with her, but there is a code.
bros before hoes, man.
crap.
what is it?
death row guy is dying.
bradycardia. His heart rate's dropped to 30.
it's not gonna hold out much longer.
you just waiting to call time of death, or are you gonna give him atropine?
temporary fix?
right.
don't know why those diabetics are all hung up on insulin.
they're just gonna have to take more.
Atropine's only gonna buy you a few hours.
we don't even know what's wrong with him.
just get out of here.
this is Chase.
did you beat any confessions out of anybody?
I haven't spoken to any inmates.
does anybody do their jobs anymore?
I decided Clarence's life isn't worth risking mine for.
appreciate your candor.
did you even go to the prison, or are you just out playing polo?
I'm searching both of Clarence's cells.
I figured if he's on something, it's stashed somewhere.
unless he finished it.
Yeah, that'd be a shame.
he could have shoved it anywhere.
there's envelopes stacked to the ceiling, bottles of copier toner, boxes of rubber bands, paper, file folders.
call it off.
come on back.
what's going on?
you're dying.
house: A man deserves a last drink.
you're okay.
Thanks. That means a lot.
all the tests have been inconclusive?
diagnostics is more of an art than a science.
should I be worried right now?
I work for one of the top diagnosticians in the country.
we're pouring all of our energy into figuring this out.
house: I thought you convicts knew how to drink.
you're at least three shots behind.
now you're four shots behind.
you better get me the next one, or I'm gonna kill you.
I was just waiting for test results, I was...
little busy right now. Getting my drink on.
unbelievable.
Oof! That's the finest piece I've seen in 10 years.
I could've hit that.
and you didn't?
eh.
man, you're the one that should be locked up.
tell me something.
I've been trying to figure this out.
why does a guy who's on death row suddenly try to off himself?
I know you drank that copier fluid.
it's not as visually dramatic as slitting your wrists with a homemade shiv, but it will do the trick.
it just hit me all of a sudden.
it was like, they tell me when to eat, when to sleep, when to walk, when to talk, everything.
I had to take control of something, right?
when to die.
I figured that was as good as anything.
and that thought just came to you, just like that?
man, I told you, Twenty-three hours a
Mmm.
look, here's the good news.
the copier fluid you drank contains about 90% methanol, which is very poisonous, and you took more than enough to kill yourself.
the bad news is, the alcohol you just drank contains so much ethanol that it's going to bind with that nasty formic acid rampaging through your body, hence you're just gonna pee it out.
harmlessly.
man, you are drunk.
Yes, I am. I also saved your life.
Shee-ya.
at least for now.
morning!
your head hurts?
no, you just have a very grating voice.
you always were a lightweight.
why are you talking to me?
can't it be enough that I wanna cause you pain?
the patient's okay now, you're gonna send him back?
Absolutely.
can I trust you?
you used to.
I still think the patient's sick. I'm keeping him here.
Yeah. Either you can do your job and keep the hospital informed, or you can help me make sure the hospital is not informed and buy me some time.
chase: Have you done a CT?
Yeah, I have.
contrast?
she's done everything ,she needs to do except tell her patient that she's dying.
I told you, only I get to play with the markers.
our prisoner has a new symptom.
I'm not telling Cindy she's dying until the diagnosis is confirmed.
I'm not buying that Clarence was trying to take control of his life by suicide.
healthy people don't kill themselves.
healthy people don't kill other people.
guy just filed an appeal in a state...
that hasn't actually killed anybody in about 30 years.
what if it wasn't suicide?
what if it was an escape plan?
drink enough methanol to get transferred to a hospital, try to escape from here.
excellent.
explains everything except the symptom that got him here.
his heart went nuts before he got stuck in that storage cell and chugged a toner martini.
I think there's something going on in his head.
check for intracranial lesions, brain infections, autoimmune diseases, do a CT, LP, full workup.
state's paying, so go nuts.
foreman: Where'd you get these scars?
I got shivved my first month in.
after I healed up, I got mines.
you guys still think I'm sick?
obviously.
why do you care?
why don't you just let me die?
I'm different than you.
right. You love me like your own mama.
that's why the nurse says you kicked her out when my heart nearly stopped.
take a deep breath.
any family history of mental illness?
I always heard my pop was crazy, I never met the man.
with my mom, it was the drugs.
any siblings?
I got a brother, pretty much raised him on my own.
inspirational story.
he doing time, too?
hey...
he's a good kid.
don't go judging what you don't know.
how's his health?
I haven't heard from him since I went inside.
spent 16 years with him, changed his damn diapers.
can you imagine your whole life being all about the worst thing you ever did?
you killed four people.
and somehow making mac and cheese just the way he wants kind of loses its significance.
Oh, no.
now you've left your entire body in my chair.
what does that mean you want?
I need a segmental bronchoalveolar lavage.
I take it the CT with contrast came back?
they're not definitive.
biopsy would be.
biopsy would be invasive and unnecessary.
and definitive.
but you don't want definitive, you want to hang onto your delusions as long as you can.
a lavage could prove it's not cancer.
but you need me to approve the procedure. Must be a bitch.
the answer is no.
Why? Because it's me?
I'm over you! I've jumped on the bandwagon.
and I hate you, okay?
great. Let's treat her.
what is it?
you won't help Cindy, but you're obsessed with this piece of dirt!
are you just trying to prove that who someone is doesn't matter, or that all that matters is your stupid puzzle?
fine. Treat them the same, that's all I'm asking.
one test.
wow, that is remarkable.
according to those patchouli oil-selling New Agers, it's supposed to be the terminal patient, but you're going through the five stages.
you just made a completely seamless transition from anger to bargaining.
cover two more of my clinic hours, and you can have your one procedure.
no lesions, no aneurysms.
ironically, the mind of a killer looks completely normal.
if someone asked you to describe me to them, what's the first thing you'd tell them?
insecure.
what are you asking?
like if you were setting me up on a blind date.
would you describe me to the girl as the black guy?
a neurologist?
car thief?
this guy's really getting to you, isn't he?
there's no sign of infection.
you're gonna have to do the biopsy.
CUDDY: Your death row guy's still here.
Yeah, sorry. I've just gotta get him stabilized.
probably keep him on fluids for a few more hours, then off he goes.
Oh, yeah? Cause I'm figuring that you still think he's sick.
figuring requires deductive reasoning.
I'm figuring that you did no figuring.
Stacy just ratted me out, right?
so much for attorney-client privilege.
I'm the client, you moron.
Stacy has a duty to this hospital.
right.
I'm sending him back to prison.
whoa, can't. Court order.
court order says he has to be declared healthy.
doesn't specify which doctor needs to make that declaration.
what is it, Clarence?
my gut!
would you describe it as a shooting pain?
a throbbing pain?
or maybe an imaginary pain because you don't want to go back to prison?
where does it hurt?
my gut, I feel like I'm getting stabbed!
well, he'd know.
let me take a look.
Oh, so everybody lies except a convicted murderer?
I don't think he's faking this stuff.
what do you think, Doctor?
I didn't have any choice.
no, you had to tell Cuddy.
she's your boss, I get it.
Hitler thought he was doing the world a favor, too.
Yeah, pretty much on that same level.
gandhi didn't march to the sea because his buddies asked him to.
pol Pot didn't wipe out the teachers because he wanted to make friends.
you're not making friends right now.
I trusted you.
I know.
Wilson's a fool. I'm an idiot.
I had to do what I thought was right.
it's the only reason anybody does anything.
surgery went fine.
they removed almost a foot of necrotic bowel.
they're shackling him and taking him into recovery.
I wonder.
I wonder why Clarence killed that second inmate?
fine, I'll bite.
what the hell are you talking about?
everything we do is dictated by motive.
why did he kill his girlfriend?
because he's a maniac!
is that the reason he gave?
she was cheating on him.
jealousy.
that gets him sent to prison.
where he kills inmate number one. Why?
guy attacked him first.
revenge.
who'd he kill after that?
prison guard.
who had a file full of abuse complaints.
probably been kicking Clarence's ass for months.
Clarence is just ridding the world of bad seeds.
call that one "retribution
then he kills inmate number two.
anybody know why?
Uh-uh. It's not in there.
CLARENCE: All of a sudden, I gotta have a reason?
it's an anomaly.
doctors love anomalies.
dark spot on an x-ray, bright spot on an MRI.
killing that second inmate was the homicidal equivalent of blood in the urine.
it doesn't fit.
I'm interested in things that don't fit.
tell me why you did it.
your other victims you were almost bragging about.
what was different about this guy?
it happened when I was in gen-pop.
I was in the library, just reading.
and I started feeling real nervous.
this guy was staring at me.
I could feel his eyes digging holes in the back of my neck.
made me feel crazy.
sweat was pouring down my face.
I could hear my heartbeat racing in my ears.
I just raged out on the dude.
so what's the differential for raging out?
excess testosterone, steroids.
Adrenalin?
prep Clarence for surgery.
care to share with the class?
Oh, come on, do I have to spell it out for you?
pheochromocytoma.
actually, I'm not sure how you spell it.
but you said it yourself, adrenalin.
pheochromocytoma sits on top of the adrenal gland, randomly spits out oodles of the stuff.
it's perfect. It explains everything, the tachycardia, pulmonary edema, the vasoconstriction that caused the necrotic bowel.
even explains how he had the strength to rip the rail off his bed.
but pheo's extremely rare.
I love rare.
set up an MRI. Where's Cameron?
like I don't know.
Dr. Cameron, could I borrow you for a consult?
bittersweet thing about being head of the Oncology Department,
I get CCED on all the biopsy results.
Yeah, I know.
she's terminal.
Yeah. So I take it you were in there informing her?
well, I-I hadn't exactly gotten around to that, but I was just
doing what? Making friends?
Cindy's divorced.
she doesn't have any kids, no siblings, both her parents are gone.
it's not your job to be her friend!
do you understand?
and it's not worth it.
she feels better her final few days, and you're not the same, maybe for years.
you don't think it's worth it?
I know it's not worth it.
my husband was
I met him just after he was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.
if I hadn't married him.
he was alone.
when a good person dies, there should be an impact on the world.
somebody should notice.
somebody should be upset.
what?
I don't even remember.
it's just a fancy way of saying small, adrenalin-secreting tumor.
Yeah, that clarified it for you.
all you need to know is, if I'm right, we can fix it.
just gotta find it first.
we need an MRI.
it's completely painless for most people.
but not for me?
I assume you got those tattoos in prison.
prison tats often contain inks with heavy metals.
the MRI is basically a giant magnet, suck those metallic inks right out of your skin.
stop squirming.
don't make us do this again.
big baby.
still don't see anything.
CLARENCE: Turn it off!
there's Waldo.
found it, Clarence.
turn it off!
turn this damn thing off!
keep him in there until you guys see it, too.
son of a bitch.
looks like they got the pheo out successfully.
so, what now?
Clarence goes back to death row.
just like that?
he's cured.
that tumor caused random shots of adrenalin, which obviously led to the rage attacks that made him become a murderer in the first place.
my God, you're right!
let's call the surgeons, we gotta save that tumor.
put it on the witness stand.
we could testify at Clarence's appeal.
you smell that?
I think that is the stink of hypocrisy.
you wouldn't even consider the notion that Clarence's social upbringing was responsible for what he became, but now you're sprinting to the witness stand to blame everything on a little tumor.
a person's upbringing and their biology are completely different.
Yeah. Because you only overcame one of them.
well, let's just give Clarence a free pass, hmmm?
which is probably gonna piss off all those other pheo sufferers who managed to control their rage attacks and become lawyers, race car drivers, or even doctors.
removing that tumor puts a stop to those random shots of adrenalin.
it doesn't absolve him.
you want him to be executed?
that's not what I'm saying.
got an opinion?
everyone's got an opinion.
I, uh, I think I'm gonna testify at Clarence's appeal.
you'll do what you think is right.
on your own time.
but it's just a cough.
[Panting]
good morning.
Hey, Alfredo.
you done already?
no. Not yet. I, uh, finish tomorrow.
mexico playing Argentina on TV?
no, no.
[Panting]
my asthma is very bad today.
six years, Alfredo. You can't lie to me.
I'm throwing a dinner...
first thing tomorrow...
party's tonight.
a little rain and I'm gonna have to put buckets on the dining room table.
no clouds, no rain.
I'll tell you what.
you take off, but if it pours into my guests' wineglasses...
okay. Okay, Senora. I'll do it.
thank you.
[Inhales] Whoof.
[Spanish] No problema.
[coughing]
[ALFREDO SCREAMING]
[ALFREDO GROANING]
[SIREN WAILING]
spinal cord seems intact.
take a deep breath.
[gasping] It hurts.
try.
breath sounds bilateral. I don't think he has a pneumothorax.
just asthma.
that and probably a broken rib.
tell me when it hurts the most.
God! Ay! Ay!
your two little fingers are darker than the others.
they feel funny. Como needles.
how long have they been like that?
never noticed before.
is bad?
CUDDY: Judging by how it looks, he could lose his hand.
how does falling off your roof do that to a guy's fingers?
he could have tweaked a vertebra in his neck.
could impinge the ulnar...
sorry, trouble concentrating.
that tank top really absorbs moisture.
could impinge the ulnar nerve, cut the blood flow.
or it could be disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.
guy falls off a roof, the first thought is always, "It's a clotting problem.
trauma can activate the clotting enzymes.
guy could lose more than his hand.
thank you very much.
this guy's been working for me for a long time, and I...
do I get bonus points if I act like I care?
cervical MRI. Work up for DIC. And start him on a heparin drip.
who?
you wanna know his name?
I'm sure it's in the file. Or you could ask her.
she's his oldest, bestest friend. They were in Cub Scouts together.
I'll get started on the blood tests.
you haven't been a real doctor in 10 years. You'll make a mess all over the sheets.
I'll do it. You have clinic duty.
I still know how to handle a patient.
get me blood. Lots of blood.
they're better. They've showered.
you don't need to see him.
one-handed handymen aren't in big demand.
talking. That's how lawsuits are lost.
I know you, Lisa.
you go in, you offer to pay his medical bills, his wages, you'll say something stupid like "I'm sorry."
you think I'm an idiot.
I think you're not a lawyer. Don't go in there.
trust me, House's people can handle this.
Yeah.
chase: This might sting a little bit.
the medicine will thin the blood and help it to circulate.
those are pretty nasty scars there.
they were construction.
[Groaning]
how long will I be in the hospital?
depends how long it takes us to figure out what's going on.
I need to work. I'll get fired.
I'm sure Dr. Cuddy won't fire you.
I'm janitor at... fast food six nights. I need to work.
my mother doesn't make enough.
I can work. I'm old enough.
you're old enough when you finish college.
Why? You never went...
I never had a big brother to tell me to shut up!
I promise we'll let you out of here as soon as we're able to.
okay, I'm fine. I feel better. I go home now.
no. If this is a clotting problem, it could be very serious.
all right?
look, you can't make me stay.
wait...
Ah, you can't make me stay.
turn your hand over.
I need to see your hand.
Where's Dr. Cuddy?
chase: We've got a third finger turning dark.
his PTT is prolonged and the fibrin split products are off.
he's not clotting properly. It looks like a mild case of DIC.
well, obviously not that mild.
this keeps up, his hand is literally gonna be dead meat.
his hand is connected to his arm, and his arm is connected to...
I'm not sure, but I bet it's important.
all this from falling off my roof!
Yeah. If only he'd fallen on his head.
then he wouldn't have any of these symptoms.
we need something stronger than heparin.
human Activated Protein C.
looks like Cuddy, same cleavage.
protein C is indicated only for severe sepsis.
how many of his limbs have to be at stake for it to be severe?
but this stuff is crazy dangerous.
it can cause internal bleeding.
if he bleeds, he could stroke, he could die.
he could get better.
you know, if I try to scheme like this, you get that nasty wrinkly face and screech like a hyena.
it's very sexy, I admit.
do it.
[Elevator DINGS]
protein C is borderline irresponsible, except that the safe stuff isn't doing squat.
it's exactly the type of thing you would do.
obviously.
it's exactly the type of thing he'd do.
I know. I think he's trying to protect me.
now, that's not the type of thing he would do.
I overruled him.
he's the best diagnostician in this hospital, and I overrule him.
you care about this kid.
your judgment should be worth more than his.
he also pointed out that I haven't been a real doctor in years.
now that sounds like him.
you were just jerking Cuddy around?
she seriously thought I wanted to stop her.
one thing Cuddy is not is clueless.
no. First casualty of this case is her sense of humor.
weird, nothing funnier than almost killing a guy.
I'm just having trouble getting up those steps.
when did you start noticing?
Oh, a week ago.
your blood pressure's a little high.
I've got something new that should help you out.
it combines a nitrate with a blood pressure pill.
it's targeted to African-Americans.
targeted?
Yeah. Well, see, we tend to have nitric oxide deficiencies.
and the studies show this drug counteracts that problem.
it's the first drug to...
what kind of studies you talking about?
what kind of studies are there?
they get some patients. They give them some drugs.
Ah~~I've had white people lying to me for 60 years.
you think this is a tan?
you think they tell you everything?
the trouble with us black folk, we can't tell the difference anymore between racism and everybody gets screwed.
yeah? Well, how about them cheap meningitis drugs they're pawning off in Africa?
gonna tell me that ain't racism?
that's just greed.
you really wanna screw whitey?
be one of the few black men who live long enough to collect social security.
take the medicine.
[ECG BEEPING]
[gasping] N-nurse.
nurse! Help! Nurse! Help!
nurse!
what's up?
I can't move my arm! I can't move my arm!
take it easy. Take it easy.
the Protein C side effects we were worried about, they happened.
where was the bleed?
his brain.
it's causing right side paralysis.
I've stopped the treatment and called a neurosurgeon.
I can move it now.
it's okay now, yes? Can I go home soon?
the surgery went well.
but all we did was fix the problem created by the medicine we gave you.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]
she says you... You look young.
are you sure...
there's five of us working on the case.
the others are older.
why doesn't Dr. Cuddy come to...
[coughing]
that doesn't sound too good.
cameron: His fingers are even darker.
his temperature's 102 and spiking.
and the x-ray now shows lung infiltrates.
well, the good news is he won't be bitching about losing his hand if he can't breathe.
the trauma from the fall could have caused acute respiratory distress syndrome.
right. I forgot. Your roof.
it would cause lung infiltrates and maybe fever and conceivably the cyanotic fingers.
the only question is why.
why what?
why her weird psychopathology requires a diagnosis informed entirely by personal guilt.
let's assume we've been wrong up until now.
let's assume, just for one second, that the earth doesn't revolve around Cuddy's roof.
what if he was sick before he had his run-in with gravity?
he just didn't notice anything.
well, pneumonia can cause DIC which can cause cyanotic fingers.
pneumonia doesn't hit that fast.
sure. Only pavement hits that fast.
it's not pneumonia.
he might have missed a finger turning dark.
he's not gonna miss breathing problems.
what else?
it's pneumonia.
he wanted to go home. I thought he was lying.
I told him I had a dinner party. I made him go up there.
well, why didn't you just take out a gun and shoot him?
I thought it was just asthma.
you might've mentioned this earlier, Doctor.
maybe we could have sent some blood cultures to the lab, instead of wasting a day indulging your self-loathing.
if it's just garden-variety bacterial pneumonia, he's gonna be fine.
so give him garden-variety Levaquin, and a garden-variety echocardiogram.
and go check out the kid's house.
the blood work will show us which type of pneumonia it is...
if he's huffing nail polish or pulling the wings off his pet parrot, this way'll be faster.
and I bet Julio's just dying to find out what's wrong with him.
go with her.
it's Alfredo.
and I can handle getting a key and...
Rico and I no longer trust you deciding what's important and what's not.
you ever think about writing a book on office politics?
trust me, it would be a lot worse if I told her that you had to break into her house.
[STUTTERING] What? Wait, wait, wait... Cuddy's... house?
see? It is shocking.
guy's been working there every day for the last three weeks.
you think it's impossible he could've picked something up?
I'm not breaking into my boss's house.
I'm your boss.
she's scarier than you are.
Ehh...she's a woman.
relax. I'm coming with.
[Elevator DINGS]
house is having lunch with his juniors now?
no. Not a chance.
then where do you think they're going?
I have no idea.
then why don't you think they're going to lunch?
because it's not like House. That was your point, right?
he had that smug look on his face.
when he's that pleased about something he's gotta tell somebody, and the only somebody he knows is you.
[SIGHING]He's breaking into Cuddy's home.
what? Why?
Um...medical reasons?
why is he so curious about Cuddy?
why are you so curious about his curiosity?
why are you so curious about me being...
because you dumped him. And you're married.
and they are neither of those things.
I'm just curious.
nothing wrong with that.
no, nothing wrong with that.
what do you think? Red thongs?
I think red thongs.
okay, 20 bucks says I can get through this door in 20 seconds.
you're on.
count me in.
no furniture polish, no paint thinner, nor anything else worth sniffing.
nothing in here, either, except a few cockroaches.
nice. Someone should fix Alfredo's roof.
so, why haven't you fired House?
it's just, you guys are always screaming at each other, and I figure you hate him, so...
I don't hate him.
why not?
he's a great doctor, but any other hospital administrator would have fired him years ago.
CUDDY: Four of them did.
the question is, why did I hire him?
foreman: So, how'd you know about her key?
you been doing a little handyman work for Cuddy yourself?
someone as obsessive and insecure as Cuddy probably has three extra keys hidden away within 10 feet of the door.
Oh, and you consider obsession a negative quality.
insecticide is organic. Soap is hypoallergenic.
I got the bedroom.
this is where it all happens.
you both went to Michigan. Did you know him while you were there?
uh, I was still an undergrad, but, yeah, I knew him.
he was already a legend.
so you just knew him as a legend?
my God, you're subtle.
anything on your mind?
more cockroaches?
worse.
beautiful.
there's no way you just deduced where that key was.
does this count as red?
you gave yourself 20 seconds and put money on it.
Oh, my God.
she's got pictures of you in here.
just you. It's like some kind of weird shrine.
you're kidding.
Yeah.
she uses super tampons. What does that mean?
you two are just too nasty to each other not to have been... nasty.
I can be a jerk to people I haven't slept with.
I am that good.
there's nothing here.
you ready to go, or you got some more stuff you wanna sniff?
Whoa! Check this out.
it's fuzzy. It's black. It's alive.
patient's lung function's declining rapidly. Levaquin's not working.
he obviously doesn't have garden-variety pneumonia.
I'm glad you learned to take his impending death in stride.
guess what he does have.
rats.
scars on his hand.
rat bites.
but he says they're from construction work so he won't have to admit he's got rats at home.
catholics are right. Pride will kill you.
he has streptobacillus.
rat bite fever.
boogie oogie oogie.
fits the symptoms perfectly.
that's certainly one possibility.
but what about the aspergillus fungus we found under the sink?
what sink?
you ought to clean your bathroom better.
you broke into my house?
no. No, you're wrong. I had a key.
you had no right to invade my privacy.
there was no medical reason for that whatsoever, and there was certainly no moral reason for it.
Oh, damn.
you're right.
the focal consolidation makes fungal pneumonia far more likely.
you're right ,I'm right.
on the bright side, it has the advantage of keeping you totally responsible.
treatment for aspergillus is amphotericin.
that's hugely dangerous.
yeah? Your point being?
going the dangerous and aggressive route didn't work the last time.
it's bound to work this time. Start him on the "amphoterrible."
[ALFREDO COUGHING]
Dr. Cuddy?
I'm Manny, Alfredo's brother.
how's he doing?
he's worried about money. I wanna work for you.
[SIGHING]
how old are you, Manny?
I can paint. I mow lawns. I rake leaves. I can start today.
Alfredo wants you to finish school.
like you care.
Manny, I've known your brother...
he falls off your roof, and you don't come see him once?
[INWARDLY]Bitch.
[Music PLAYING ON TV]
with a patient.
not according to the log.
it's 3: 15.
is it a commercial?
how's Cuddy doing?
she's not acting like Cuddy. It's a pleasure.
you know her.
she has trouble with these situations, feels personally responsible.
the technical term is narcissism.
you can't believe that everything is your fault unless you also believe you're all-powerful.
wow, does she sound messed up.
I don't believe I can fix everything.
and I don't lie awake at night, tormented by that fact.
no. You lie awake tormented by how...
I thought we were talking about Cuddy here.
she cares.
she enjoys feeling guilty.
Lisa cares. It's why she drives you nuts. Cause it's not just a puzzle to her.
the patients are actually real, their feelings actually relevant.
and I'm telling her she can't even talk to him.
my God, it's contagious. You're feeling guilty, too.
I'm just saying, take it easy on her. You owe her that.
man ON TV: From the moment I saw you at the ER...
commercial's over.
so glad we talked.
snap, crackle, pop.
you got some Rice Krispies in there?
that bad, huh?
you were here yesterday.
I see from the chart that Dr. Foreman prescribed medicine, not a miracle.
got to give this stuff more than a day.
I didn't fill that Oreo's prescription.
on the theory that you didn't trust him because he's black.
well, I'm gonna prescribe the same medicine and see if you fill it this time.
I'm not buying into no racist drug, okay?
[SCOFFING]
it's racist because it helps black people more than white people?
on behalf of my peeps, let me just say thanks for dying on principle for us.
look, my heart's red. Your heart's red.
and it don't make no sense to give us different drugs.
you know, I have found a difference.
admittedly, it's a limited sample, but based on my experience of the last 90 seconds, all black people are morons.
sorry, African-Americans. I'll see another doctor.
I'll see another doctor.
fine. Fine.
I'll give you the same medicine we give Republicans.
ALFREDO: I think the medicine is working.
they're lighter, right?
they don't look lighter to me, Alfredo. How's the tingling?
does not bother me.
tell her the other thing.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]Dile.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]Callate, Manny.
he hasn't peed since yesterday.
since last night?
afternoon.
it's not a problem. I don't drink much.
I think we'll give you a little rest from the meds here.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]
she says, That's the medicine that's supposed to cure me.
just making a little adjustment. Excuse me.
he's not making any urine.
I think we just destroyed the kid's kidney with the amphotericin.
I think he's dying.
dying?
geez, it's the cops.
[SOBBING IN SPANISH]
I guess she understands a little English.
cameron: His kidneys are shutting down due to the direct toxicity to the proximal tubule epithelium.
proof that my brilliant idea of giving him amphotericin is killing him.
that wasn't a complete waste of time.
his reaction shows that you don't need to clean under your sink.
it wasn't aspergillus.
and blood cultures show he was negative for rat-bite fever.
there's still plenty of other cool pneumonias.
tested negative for Moraxella, Nocardia, Cryptococcus.
he has a low titer for chlamydia antibodies. Maybe...
no, no. His chest x-ray's all wrong for chlamydial pneumonia.
but the titer points to...
cameron: He had an STD last year. That explains the titer.
he has low sodium. Maybe it's Legionella.
no. His antigen is negative.
well, that all sucks.
maybe we were right to begin with.
his problems are all caused by DIC precipitated by falling off my roof.
DIC wouldn't cause a fever this high.
see? My lapdog agrees with me.
how high?
two hours ago it was 39.5 with acetaminophen.
what about on St. Alban's Day?
only temperature I'm interested in right now is his temperature right now.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]
open up.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]
okay. Let me clarify. Open up and keep it open.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]
Yeah.
okay.
under your tongue.
you're using your left hand.
right one hurt?
no, I feel better.
well, it really doesn't hurt, or you just figure if you say no, you'll get out of the hospital sooner?
it doesn't hurt. I feel good.
[Sniffing]
you don't smell too hot.
[Groaning]
your hand is starting to rot.
house: Why are we here?
we are talking about cutting off a kid's hand.
Yes, we're talking about cutting it off, not subdividing it and putting in condos.
it's not a legal issue.
are you being intentionally dense?
huh?
I think it's premature.
I've heard enough.
what?
she says one word， and you take her side.
you should at least wait until she actually gives a medical reason.
otherwise I might take it personally.
shut up.
if I were to somehow find out that you two were in disagreement over the proper medical course of action, it could make it awkward for my client in court.
my client being the two of you. So, guys, I'm a little busy here.
why don't we pick this conversation up in half an hour?
okay?
all of his symptoms are caused by his underlying problem and the medicine we gave him.
what underlying problem?
you have no idea what the underlying problem is.
you're the diagnostician.
fine. It's all my fault. Does that make you feel better?
his hand still has an arterial pulse.
his hand is a cesspool. And the crap is spreading.
you are being pretty aggressive about destroying a man's livelihood.
I don't give a damn about his livelihood.
he loses that hand, he loses his job, all of his jobs.
he's not like us...
can't work as a cripple?
he loses his home.
his kid brother drops out.
an American dream destroyed.
very sad, very emotional, not one medical fact in the whole pathetic tale.
you have lost perspective, Cuddy.
you've stopped looking at this as a doctor.
you're acting like someone who shoved somebody off their roof.
you wanna make things right? Too bad, nothing's ever right.
I am happy to report that we're now so in sync we're actually wearing each other's underwear.
Chop-chop time.
is this true?
house: No. I'm lying.
stupid to do with her in the room, I guess.
this is a big decision.
we made it.
we should convene a meeting of the ethics committee.
No!
look, she is making a medical decision based on never wanting to feel regret.
you're making a legal decision based on wanting me to be wrong.
Greg, you have a history of aggressive...
you wanted superficial agreement.
you wanted everybody's asses covered. You got it.
now can I do the surgery? Pretty, pretty please.
are you sure you're okay with this?
I should be the one to tell the family.
your hand is dying.
the bacteria are eating it.
when they run out of food there, they go somewhere else.
if you cut off my hand, I'll be cured?
unfortunately, no.
we still have to find the disease that's making you sick to begin with.
but you won't die of gangrene while we're looking.
[sobbing]
I quit school when I am twelve to get a job, to help my family.
I know I never get a good job, never save money or own my own house like you.
but Manny, he's smart.
he's the best in his class.
well, maybe Manny doesn't have to quit school. Maybe you can...
are you sure I need to do this?
Yes.
okay.
[sobbing] Okay.
["Duermete, Mi Nino" Preformed by Christine Avila]
I gave one of my clinic patients a follow-up call.
your name came up.
I'm guessing an old black guy who thinks the CIA invented rap music to make your people want to kill each other.
he said you gave him the white folks' stuff.
this is exactly why black people don't live as long...
this isn't about race, unless annoying is a race.
is he not getting better?
he's fine so far.
I'm calling him back in. I'm getting him on the right stuff.
Oh, relax, Foreman, he already is.
I told him it was the white stuff. I gave him the black stuff.
he was right.
you did exactly what white people do.
you figure we don't need to know the truth or can't understand it.
so you just lie to us.
just a white lie.
good one, massa.
right, and I'm a racist.
too bad that idiot will never know for the rest of his long, long life.
every slave master thought they were doing the black man a favor.
Negro can't take care of himself, so we'll put him to work.
we'll give him four walls, a bed.
we'll civilize the heathen.
I'll tell you what. Stop doing us favors.
if you're right, and we end up back in the jungle with lousy blood pressure medicine, it won't be on your head.
you okay?
you wondering if you made the right call?
I've wanted to be a doctor from the time I was twelve.
I wanted to be a lawyer from the time I was six until my second week of law school.
sorry. Your story.
I graduated medical school at 25, pissed off that I was second in my class.
chief of medicine at 32, second youngest ever, first woman...
sad story.
if I had been Alfredo's doctor...
you are his doctor.
I insisted on giving him Protein C. We had to cut his skull open.
I insisted on amphotericin, killed his kidneys.
I missed the pneumonia completely.
I would have searched his home and ignored mine.
I would have watched him die trying to save his hand.
Oh, if I didn't have House looking over my shoulder...
are you saying you're not as good a doctor as House is?
I'm saying House is right.
I was so anxious to get ahead.
I haven't been a doctor... in years.
his little finger is dusky.
Yeah, that's why we're doing this.
no. I mean the other hand, the one we haven't chopped off yet.
CUDDY: His O2 sats are down to 88.
his lungs are giving out. He needs a ventilator.
and dialysis.
getting distracted by the multisystem organ failure.
pinkies are supposed to be pink, right?
they're not called "gray-ies."
but the organ failure is gonna kill him.
but the pinky is weirder.
what does it tell us?
the same thing the right hand told us before we cut it off.
it's the same symptom.
house: But at a different time.
his blood work indicates mild DIC.
what if it's mild in the way that when you get out of the ocean, the water clinging to your body makes the sea level drop?
it's technically true, but it's completely irrelevant.
a lack of DIC would explain everything if there were also a lack of anything to explain.
endocarditis. His heart's infected.
little bacteria cauliflowers, clinging to his valves.
except sometimes they can't hold on. They go swimming in his bloodstream.
thursday, one breaks off, goes to his right hand, black fingers, gangrene.
friday's child heads for the kidneys.
and we all know what Saturdays are all about.
party with the left hand.
also explains the fever.
it's perfect.
except for the little fact that we already tested for endocarditis, and he was negative.
which means he either is negative or...
what infection can cause pneumonia and culture-negative endocarditis?
prize value goes down with every clue.
[SQUAWKING LIKE A BIRD]
you're thinking psittacosis?
Alfredo doesn't have any pet parrots.
quit your squawking. Give him doxycycline.
No! That'll just make his clotting problem worse.
I liked you better when you were coming up with wacky drugs for us to try.
we give him the doxy now, damn it, maybe we can save his pinky.
he can teach his brother to count all the way to five.
if you're wrong, he'll end up with no hands and no feet.
technically, if I'm wrong, he'll end up dead, but I take your point.
what's his night job?
he cleans up at some fast food joint.
what, you think he got it from a chicken nugget?
since when do fast food joints allow 12-year-olds to mop floors?
Alfredo is 20.
Really? Looks younger.
where were you going to work tonight?
what job do you do on Saturday nights?
CUDDY: What are you doing?
wake him up.
we just cut off his hand.
Yeah. We need to talk about it.
it's not happening.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]
honest, I've got no idea what I just said.
why didn't you say you spoke Spanish?
well, because she'd wanna talk to me.
or something like that.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]
she says he doesn't work Saturday nights.
give me the talking juice.
the fact it doesn't fit your theory doesn't make it a lie.
when she was out of the room, the kid brother insisted he was gonna cover for Alfredo at work tonight.
[Speaking IN SPANISH...]
Saturday nights he goes dancing.
either it's a lie or he's dancing with birds.
give her the talking juice.
she doesn't know what you're talking about.
odds are it's gonna be close to his house.
probably an abandoned warehouse or factory.
take the Scooby gang and spread out.
what the hell are we looking for?
find somebody who looks like crap.
tell him you want to place a bet.
uh...
[Speaking IN JAPANESE]Sayonara.
[LATIN MUSIC PLAYING]
[People SHOUTING]
[Cell PHONE RINGING]
it's Cuddy.
I already put him on the psittacosis meds.
soon as you left.
you're welcome.
what do you think the record for one-handed juggling is?
you can yo-yo one-handed.
good point.
ALFREDO: I always wash my hands.
if a bird is infected, you can get psittacosis just from breathing his dust.
but then, why do I get sick and nobody else?
your asthma made you vulnerable.
you're gonna be all right now.
Yes.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]Gracias.
for saving my life.
he thanked me.
he should have.
we cut off his hand.
if we'd figured it out earlier...
if you'd figured it out later, he'd be dead.
I never figured it out at all.
hello.
what do you want, House?
if you're wallowing in self-loathing, I've got something that might help.
we're getting sued.
you saved his life. He admitted that.
we'll settle.
he's got a stub where his hand used to be. We have insurance.
case seems pretty solid to me.
ka-ching. The new American dream. Happy ending.
kid's gonna be just fine.
your guilt.
it's perverse and it makes you a crappy doctor.
it also makes you okay at what you do.
you figure a perverted sense of guilt makes me a good boss?
now, would the world be a better place if people never felt guilty?
makes sex better.
should have seen her in the last months of our relationship.
a lot of guilt. A lot of screaming.
I know this wasn't just because it was your roof.
you see the world as it is, and you see the world as it could be.
and what you don't see is what everybody else sees, the giant gaping chasm in between.
house, I'm not naive. I realize...
if you did, you never would have hired me.
you're not happy unless things are just right, which means two things.
that you're a good boss, and you'll never be happy.
by the way, why does everybody think you and I had sex?
think there could be something to it?
wilson: Cuddy feels guilty about not diagnosing psittacosis any earlier?
think so.
there's no way she could've.
no.
no way she could have.

okay. Okay, Senora. I'll do it.
thank you.
[Inhales] Whoof.
[Spanish] No problema.
[coughing]
[ALFREDO SCREAMING]
[ALFREDO GROANING]
[SIREN WAILING]
spinal cord seems intact.
take a deep breath.
[gasping] It hurts.
try.
breath sounds bilateral. I don't think he has a pneumothorax.
just asthma.
that and probably a broken rib.
tell me when it hurts the most.
God! Ay! Ay!
your two little fingers are darker than the others.
they feel funny. Como needles.
how long have they been like that?
never noticed before.
is bad?
CUDDY: Judging by how it looks, he could lose his hand.
how does falling off your roof do that to a guy's fingers?
he could have tweaked a vertebra in his neck.
could impinge the ulnar...
sorry, trouble concentrating.
that tank top really absorbs moisture.
could impinge the ulnar nerve, cut the blood flow.
or it could be disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.
guy falls off a roof, the first thought is always, "It's a clotting problem.
trauma can activate the clotting enzymes.
guy could lose more than his hand.
thank you very much.
this guy's been working for me for a long time, and I...
do I get bonus points if I act like I care?
cervical MRI. Work up for DIC. And start him on a heparin drip.
who?
you wanna know his name?
I'm sure it's in the file. Or you could ask her.
she's his oldest, bestest friend. They were in Cub Scouts together.
I'll get started on the blood tests.
you haven't been a real doctor in 10 years. You'll make a mess all over the sheets.
I'll do it. You have clinic duty.
I still know how to handle a patient.
get me blood. Lots of blood.
they're better. They've showered.
you don't need to see him.
one-handed handymen aren't in big demand.
talking. That's how lawsuits are lost.
I know you, Lisa.
you go in, you offer to pay his medical bills, his wages, you'll say something stupid like "I'm sorry."
you think I'm an idiot.
I think you're not a lawyer. Don't go in there.
trust me, House's people can handle this.
Yeah.
chase: This might sting a little bit.
the medicine will thin the blood and help it to circulate.
those are pretty nasty scars there.
they were construction.
[Groaning]
how long will I be in the hospital?
depends how long it takes us to figure out what's going on.
I need to work. I'll get fired.
I'm sure Dr. Cuddy won't fire you.
I'm janitor at... fast food six nights. I need to work.
my mother doesn't make enough.
I can work. I'm old enough.
you're old enough when you finish college.
Why? You never went...
I never had a big brother to tell me to shut up!
I promise we'll let you out of here as soon as we're able to.
okay, I'm fine. I feel better. I go home now.
no. If this is a clotting problem, it could be very serious.
all right?
look, you can't make me stay.
wait...
Ah, you can't make me stay.
turn your hand over.
I need to see your hand.
Where's Dr. Cuddy?
chase: We've got a third finger turning dark.
his PTT is prolonged and the fibrin split products are off.
he's not clotting properly. It looks like a mild case of DIC.
well, obviously not that mild.
this keeps up, his hand is literally gonna be dead meat.
his hand is connected to his arm, and his arm is connected to...
I'm not sure, but I bet it's important.
all this from falling off my roof!
Yeah. If only he'd fallen on his head.
then he wouldn't have any of these symptoms.
we need something stronger than heparin.
human Activated Protein C.
looks like Cuddy, same cleavage.
protein C is indicated only for severe sepsis.
how many of his limbs have to be at stake for it to be severe?
but this stuff is crazy dangerous.
it can cause internal bleeding.
if he bleeds, he could stroke, he could die.
he could get better.
you know, if I try to scheme like this, you get that nasty wrinkly face and screech like a hyena.
it's very sexy, I admit.
do it.
[Elevator DINGS]
protein C is borderline irresponsible, except that the safe stuff isn't doing squat.
it's exactly the type of thing you would do.
obviously.
it's exactly the type of thing he'd do.
I know. I think he's trying to protect me.
now, that's not the type of thing he would do.
I overruled him.
he's the best diagnostician in this hospital, and I overrule him.
you care about this kid.
your judgment should be worth more than his.
he also pointed out that I haven't been a real doctor in years.
now that sounds like him.
you were just jerking Cuddy around?
she seriously thought I wanted to stop her.
one thing Cuddy is not is clueless.
no. First casualty of this case is her sense of humor.
weird, nothing funnier than almost killing a guy.
I'm just having trouble getting up those steps.
when did you start noticing?
Oh, a week ago.
your blood pressure's a little high.
I've got something new that should help you out.
it combines a nitrate with a blood pressure pill.
it's targeted to African-Americans.
targeted?
Yeah. Well, see, we tend to have nitric oxide deficiencies.
and the studies show this drug counteracts that problem.
it's the first drug to...
what kind of studies you talking about?
what kind of studies are there?
they get some patients. They give them some drugs.
Ah~~I've had white people lying to me for 60 years.
you think this is a tan?
you think they tell you everything?
the trouble with us black folk, we can't tell the difference anymore between racism and everybody gets screwed.
yeah? Well, how about them cheap meningitis drugs they're pawning off in Africa?
gonna tell me that ain't racism?
that's just greed.
you really wanna screw whitey?
be one of the few black men who live long enough to collect social security.
take the medicine.
[ECG BEEPING]
[gasping] N-nurse.
nurse! Help! Nurse! Help!
nurse!
what's up?
I can't move my arm! I can't move my arm!
take it easy. Take it easy.
the Protein C side effects we were worried about, they happened.
where was the bleed?
his brain.
it's causing right side paralysis.
I've stopped the treatment and called a neurosurgeon.
I can move it now.
it's okay now, yes? Can I go home soon?
the surgery went well.
but all we did was fix the problem created by the medicine we gave you.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]
she says you... You look young.
are you sure...
there's five of us working on the case.
the others are older.
why doesn't Dr. Cuddy come to...
[coughing]
that doesn't sound too good.
cameron: His fingers are even darker.
his temperature's 102 and spiking.
and the x-ray now shows lung infiltrates.
well, the good news is he won't be bitching about losing his hand if he can't breathe.
the trauma from the fall could have caused acute respiratory distress syndrome.
right. I forgot. Your roof.
it would cause lung infiltrates and maybe fever and conceivably the cyanotic fingers.
the only question is why.
why what?
why her weird psychopathology requires a diagnosis informed entirely by personal guilt.
let's assume we've been wrong up until now.
let's assume, just for one second, that the earth doesn't revolve around Cuddy's roof.
what if he was sick before he had his run-in with gravity?
he just didn't notice anything.
well, pneumonia can cause DIC which can cause cyanotic fingers.
pneumonia doesn't hit that fast.
sure. Only pavement hits that fast.
it's not pneumonia.
he might have missed a finger turning dark.
he's not gonna miss breathing problems.
what else?
it's pneumonia.
he wanted to go home. I thought he was lying.
I told him I had a dinner party. I made him go up there.
well, why didn't you just take out a gun and shoot him?
I thought it was just asthma.
you might've mentioned this earlier, Doctor.
maybe we could have sent some blood cultures to the lab, instead of wasting a day indulging your self-loathing.
if it's just garden-variety bacterial pneumonia, he's gonna be fine.
so give him garden-variety Levaquin, and a garden-variety echocardiogram.
and go check out the kid's house.
the blood work will show us which type of pneumonia it is...
if he's huffing nail polish or pulling the wings off his pet parrot, this way'll be faster.
and I bet Julio's just dying to find out what's wrong with him.
go with her.
it's Alfredo.
and I can handle getting a key and...
Rico and I no longer trust you deciding what's important and what's not.
you ever think about writing a book on office politics?
trust me, it would be a lot worse if I told her that you had to break into her house.
[STUTTERING] What? Wait, wait, wait... Cuddy's... house?
see? It is shocking.
guy's been working there every day for the last three weeks.
you think it's impossible he could've picked something up?
I'm not breaking into my boss's house.
I'm your boss.
she's scarier than you are.
Ehh...she's a woman.
relax. I'm coming with.
[Elevator DINGS]
house is having lunch with his juniors now?
no. Not a chance.
then where do you think they're going?
I have no idea.
then why don't you think they're going to lunch?
because it's not like House. That was your point, right?
he had that smug look on his face.
when he's that pleased about something he's gotta tell somebody, and the only somebody he knows is you.
[SIGHING]He's breaking into Cuddy's home.
what? Why?
Um...medical reasons?
why is he so curious about Cuddy?
why are you so curious about his curiosity?
why are you so curious about me being...
because you dumped him. And you're married.
and they are neither of those things.
I'm just curious.
nothing wrong with that.
no, nothing wrong with that.
what do you think? Red thongs?
I think red thongs.
okay, 20 bucks says I can get through this door in 20 seconds.
you're on.
count me in.
no furniture polish, no paint thinner, nor anything else worth sniffing.
nothing in here, either, except a few cockroaches.
nice. Someone should fix Alfredo's roof.
so, why haven't you fired House?
it's just, you guys are always screaming at each other, and I figure you hate him, so...
I don't hate him.
why not?
he's a great doctor, but any other hospital administrator would have fired him years ago.
CUDDY: Four of them did.
the question is, why did I hire him?
foreman: So, how'd you know about her key?
you been doing a little handyman work for Cuddy yourself?
someone as obsessive and insecure as Cuddy probably has three extra keys hidden away within 10 feet of the door.
Oh, and you consider obsession a negative quality.
insecticide is organic. Soap is hypoallergenic.
I got the bedroom.
this is where it all happens.
you both went to Michigan. Did you know him while you were there?
uh, I was still an undergrad, but, yeah, I knew him.
he was already a legend.
so you just knew him as a legend?
my God, you're subtle.
anything on your mind?
more cockroaches?
worse.
beautiful.
there's no way you just deduced where that key was.
does this count as red?
you gave yourself 20 seconds and put money on it.
Oh, my God.
she's got pictures of you in here.
just you. It's like some kind of weird shrine.
you're kidding.
Yeah.
she uses super tampons. What does that mean?
you two are just too nasty to each other not to have been... nasty.
I can be a jerk to people I haven't slept with.
I am that good.
there's nothing here.
you ready to go, or you got some more stuff you wanna sniff?
Whoa! Check this out.
it's fuzzy. It's black. It's alive.
patient's lung function's declining rapidly. Levaquin's not working.
he obviously doesn't have garden-variety pneumonia.
I'm glad you learned to take his impending death in stride.
guess what he does have.
rats.
scars on his hand.
rat bites.
but he says they're from construction work so he won't have to admit he's got rats at home.
catholics are right. Pride will kill you.
he has streptobacillus.
rat bite fever.
boogie oogie oogie.
fits the symptoms perfectly.
that's certainly one possibility.
but what about the aspergillus fungus we found under the sink?
what sink?
you ought to clean your bathroom better.
you broke into my house?
no. No, you're wrong. I had a key.
you had no right to invade my privacy.
there was no medical reason for that whatsoever, and there was certainly no moral reason for it.
Oh, damn.
you're right.
the focal consolidation makes fungal pneumonia far more likely.
you're right ,I'm right.
on the bright side, it has the advantage of keeping you totally responsible.
treatment for aspergillus is amphotericin.
that's hugely dangerous.
yeah? Your point being?
going the dangerous and aggressive route didn't work the last time.
it's bound to work this time. Start him on the "amphoterrible."
[ALFREDO COUGHING]
Dr. Cuddy?
I'm Manny, Alfredo's brother.
how's he doing?
he's worried about money. I wanna work for you.
[SIGHING]
how old are you, Manny?
I can paint. I mow lawns. I rake leaves. I can start today.
Alfredo wants you to finish school.
like you care.
Manny, I've known your brother...
he falls off your roof, and you don't come see him once?
[INWARDLY]Bitch.
[Music PLAYING ON TV]
with a patient.
not according to the log.
it's 3: 15.
is it a commercial?
how's Cuddy doing?
she's not acting like Cuddy. It's a pleasure.
you know her.
she has trouble with these situations, feels personally responsible.
the technical term is narcissism.
you can't believe that everything is your fault unless you also believe you're all-powerful.
wow, does she sound messed up.
I don't believe I can fix everything.
and I don't lie awake at night, tormented by that fact.
no. You lie awake tormented by how...
I thought we were talking about Cuddy here.
she cares.
she enjoys feeling guilty.
Lisa cares. It's why she drives you nuts. Cause it's not just a puzzle to her.
the patients are actually real, their feelings actually relevant.
and I'm telling her she can't even talk to him.
my God, it's contagious. You're feeling guilty, too.
I'm just saying, take it easy on her. You owe her that.
man ON TV: From the moment I saw you at the ER...
commercial's over.
so glad we talked.
snap, crackle, pop.
you got some Rice Krispies in there?
that bad, huh?
you were here yesterday.
I see from the chart that Dr. Foreman prescribed medicine, not a miracle.
got to give this stuff more than a day.
I didn't fill that Oreo's prescription.
on the theory that you didn't trust him because he's black.
well, I'm gonna prescribe the same medicine and see if you fill it this time.
I'm not buying into no racist drug, okay?
[SCOFFING]
it's racist because it helps black people more than white people?
on behalf of my peeps, let me just say thanks for dying on principle for us.
look, my heart's red. Your heart's red.
and it don't make no sense to give us different drugs.
you know, I have found a difference.
admittedly, it's a limited sample, but based on my experience of the last 90 seconds, all black people are morons.
sorry, African-Americans. I'll see another doctor.
I'll see another doctor.
fine. Fine.
I'll give you the same medicine we give Republicans.
ALFREDO: I think the medicine is working.
they're lighter, right?
they don't look lighter to me, Alfredo. How's the tingling?
does not bother me.
tell her the other thing.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]Dile.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]Callate, Manny.
he hasn't peed since yesterday.
since last night?
afternoon.
it's not a problem. I don't drink much.
I think we'll give you a little rest from the meds here.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]
she says, That's the medicine that's supposed to cure me.
just making a little adjustment. Excuse me.
he's not making any urine.
I think we just destroyed the kid's kidney with the amphotericin.
I think he's dying.
dying?
geez, it's the cops.
[SOBBING IN SPANISH]
I guess she understands a little English.
cameron: His kidneys are shutting down due to the direct toxicity to the proximal tubule epithelium.
proof that my brilliant idea of giving him amphotericin is killing him.
that wasn't a complete waste of time.
his reaction shows that you don't need to clean under your sink.
it wasn't aspergillus.
and blood cultures show he was negative for rat-bite fever.
there's still plenty of other cool pneumonias.
tested negative for Moraxella, Nocardia, Cryptococcus.
he has a low titer for chlamydia antibodies. Maybe...
no, no. His chest x-ray's all wrong for chlamydial pneumonia.
but the titer points to...
cameron: He had an STD last year. That explains the titer.
he has low sodium. Maybe it's Legionella.
no. His antigen is negative.
well, that all sucks.
maybe we were right to begin with.
his problems are all caused by DIC precipitated by falling off my roof.
DIC wouldn't cause a fever this high.
see? My lapdog agrees with me.
how high?
two hours ago it was 39.5 with acetaminophen.
what about on St. Alban's Day?
only temperature I'm interested in right now is his temperature right now.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]
open up.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]
okay. Let me clarify. Open up and keep it open.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]
Yeah.
okay.
under your tongue.
you're using your left hand.
right one hurt?
no, I feel better.
well, it really doesn't hurt, or you just figure if you say no, you'll get out of the hospital sooner?
it doesn't hurt. I feel good.
[Sniffing]
you don't smell too hot.
[Groaning]
your hand is starting to rot.
house: Why are we here?
we are talking about cutting off a kid's hand.
Yes, we're talking about cutting it off, not subdividing it and putting in condos.
it's not a legal issue.
are you being intentionally dense?
huh?
I think it's premature.
I've heard enough.
what?
she says one word， and you take her side.
you should at least wait until she actually gives a medical reason.
otherwise I might take it personally.
shut up.
if I were to somehow find out that you two were in disagreement over the proper medical course of action, it could make it awkward for my client in court.
my client being the two of you. So, guys, I'm a little busy here.
why don't we pick this conversation up in half an hour?
okay?
all of his symptoms are caused by his underlying problem and the medicine we gave him.
what underlying problem?
you have no idea what the underlying problem is.
you're the diagnostician.
fine. It's all my fault. Does that make you feel better?
his hand still has an arterial pulse.
his hand is a cesspool. And the crap is spreading.
you are being pretty aggressive about destroying a man's livelihood.
I don't give a damn about his livelihood.
he loses that hand, he loses his job, all of his jobs.
he's not like us...
can't work as a cripple?
he loses his home.
his kid brother drops out.
an American dream destroyed.
very sad, very emotional, not one medical fact in the whole pathetic tale.
you have lost perspective, Cuddy.
you've stopped looking at this as a doctor.
you're acting like someone who shoved somebody off their roof.
you wanna make things right? Too bad, nothing's ever right.
I am happy to report that we're now so in sync we're actually wearing each other's underwear.
Chop-chop time.
is this true?
house: No. I'm lying.
stupid to do with her in the room, I guess.
this is a big decision.
we made it.
we should convene a meeting of the ethics committee.
No!
look, she is making a medical decision based on never wanting to feel regret.
you're making a legal decision based on wanting me to be wrong.
Greg, you have a history of aggressive...
you wanted superficial agreement.
you wanted everybody's asses covered. You got it.
now can I do the surgery? Pretty, pretty please.
are you sure you're okay with this?
I should be the one to tell the family.
your hand is dying.
the bacteria are eating it.
when they run out of food there, they go somewhere else.
if you cut off my hand, I'll be cured?
unfortunately, no.
we still have to find the disease that's making you sick to begin with.
but you won't die of gangrene while we're looking.
[sobbing]
I quit school when I am twelve to get a job, to help my family.
I know I never get a good job, never save money or own my own house like you.
but Manny, he's smart.
he's the best in his class.
well, maybe Manny doesn't have to quit school. Maybe you can...
are you sure I need to do this?
Yes.
okay.
[sobbing] Okay.
["Duermete, Mi Nino" Preformed by Christine Avila]
I gave one of my clinic patients a follow-up call.
your name came up.
I'm guessing an old black guy who thinks the CIA invented rap music to make your people want to kill each other.
he said you gave him the white folks' stuff.
this is exactly why black people don't live as long...
this isn't about race, unless annoying is a race.
is he not getting better?
he's fine so far.
I'm calling him back in. I'm getting him on the right stuff.
Oh, relax, Foreman, he already is.
I told him it was the white stuff. I gave him the black stuff.
he was right.
you did exactly what white people do.
you figure we don't need to know the truth or can't understand it.
so you just lie to us.
just a white lie.
good one, massa.
right, and I'm a racist.
too bad that idiot will never know for the rest of his long, long life.
every slave master thought they were doing the black man a favor.
Negro can't take care of himself, so we'll put him to work.
we'll give him four walls, a bed.
we'll civilize the heathen.
I'll tell you what. Stop doing us favors.
if you're right, and we end up back in the jungle with lousy blood pressure medicine, it won't be on your head.
you okay?
you wondering if you made the right call?
I've wanted to be a doctor from the time I was twelve.
I wanted to be a lawyer from the time I was six until my second week of law school.
sorry. Your story.
I graduated medical school at 25, pissed off that I was second in my class.
chief of medicine at 32, second youngest ever, first woman...
sad story.
if I had been Alfredo's doctor...
you are his doctor.
I insisted on giving him Protein C. We had to cut his skull open.
I insisted on amphotericin, killed his kidneys.
I missed the pneumonia completely.
I would have searched his home and ignored mine.
I would have watched him die trying to save his hand.
Oh, if I didn't have House looking over my shoulder...
are you saying you're not as good a doctor as House is?
I'm saying House is right.
I was so anxious to get ahead.
I haven't been a doctor... in years.
his little finger is dusky.
Yeah, that's why we're doing this.
no. I mean the other hand, the one we haven't chopped off yet.
CUDDY: His O2 sats are down to 88.
his lungs are giving out. He needs a ventilator.
and dialysis.
getting distracted by the multisystem organ failure.
pinkies are supposed to be pink, right?
they're not called "gray-ies."
but the organ failure is gonna kill him.
but the pinky is weirder.
what does it tell us?
the same thing the right hand told us before we cut it off.
it's the same symptom.
house: But at a different time.
his blood work indicates mild DIC.
what if it's mild in the way that when you get out of the ocean, the water clinging to your body makes the sea level drop?
it's technically true, but it's completely irrelevant.
a lack of DIC would explain everything if there were also a lack of anything to explain.
endocarditis. His heart's infected.
little bacteria cauliflowers, clinging to his valves.
except sometimes they can't hold on. They go swimming in his bloodstream.
thursday, one breaks off, goes to his right hand, black fingers, gangrene.
friday's child heads for the kidneys.
and we all know what Saturdays are all about.
party with the left hand.
also explains the fever.
it's perfect.
except for the little fact that we already tested for endocarditis, and he was negative.
which means he either is negative or...
what infection can cause pneumonia and culture-negative endocarditis?
prize value goes down with every clue.
[SQUAWKING LIKE A BIRD]
you're thinking psittacosis?
Alfredo doesn't have any pet parrots.
quit your squawking. Give him doxycycline.
No! That'll just make his clotting problem worse.
I liked you better when you were coming up with wacky drugs for us to try.
we give him the doxy now, damn it, maybe we can save his pinky.
he can teach his brother to count all the way to five.
if you're wrong, he'll end up with no hands and no feet.
technically, if I'm wrong, he'll end up dead, but I take your point.
what's his night job?
he cleans up at some fast food joint.
what, you think he got it from a chicken nugget?
since when do fast food joints allow 12-year-olds to mop floors?
Alfredo is 20.
Really? Looks younger.
where were you going to work tonight?
what job do you do on Saturday nights?
CUDDY: What are you doing?
wake him up.
we just cut off his hand.
Yeah. We need to talk about it.
it's not happening.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]
honest, I've got no idea what I just said.
why didn't you say you spoke Spanish?
well, because she'd wanna talk to me.
or something like that.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]
she says he doesn't work Saturday nights.
give me the talking juice.
the fact it doesn't fit your theory doesn't make it a lie.
when she was out of the room, the kid brother insisted he was gonna cover for Alfredo at work tonight.
[Speaking IN SPANISH...]
Saturday nights he goes dancing.
either it's a lie or he's dancing with birds.
give her the talking juice.
she doesn't know what you're talking about.
odds are it's gonna be close to his house.
probably an abandoned warehouse or factory.
take the Scooby gang and spread out.
what the hell are we looking for?
find somebody who looks like crap.
tell him you want to place a bet.
uh...
[Speaking IN JAPANESE]Sayonara.
[LATIN MUSIC PLAYING]
[People SHOUTING]
[Cell PHONE RINGING]
it's Cuddy.
I already put him on the psittacosis meds.
soon as you left.
you're welcome.
what do you think the record for one-handed juggling is?
you can yo-yo one-handed.
good point.
ALFREDO: I always wash my hands.
if a bird is infected, you can get psittacosis just from breathing his dust.
but then, why do I get sick and nobody else?
your asthma made you vulnerable.
you're gonna be all right now.
Yes.
[Speaking IN SPANISH]Gracias.
for saving my life.
he thanked me.
he should have.
we cut off his hand.
if we'd figured it out earlier...
if you'd figured it out later, he'd be dead.
I never figured it out at all.
hello.
what do you want, House?
if you're wallowing in self-loathing, I've got something that might help.
we're getting sued.
you saved his life. He admitted that.
we'll settle.
he's got a stub where his hand used to be. We have insurance.
case seems pretty solid to me.
ka-ching. The new American dream. Happy ending.
kid's gonna be just fine.
your guilt.
it's perverse and it makes you a crappy doctor.
it also makes you okay at what you do.
you figure a perverted sense of guilt makes me a good boss?
now, would the world be a better place if people never felt guilty?
makes sex better.
should have seen her in the last months of our relationship.
a lot of guilt. A lot of screaming.
I know this wasn't just because it was your roof.
you see the world as it is, and you see the world as it could be.
and what you don't see is what everybody else sees, the giant gaping chasm in between.
house, I'm not naive. I realize...
if you did, you never would have hired me.
you're not happy unless things are just right, which means two things.
that you're a good boss, and you'll never be happy.
by the way, why does everybody think you and I had sex?
think there could be something to it?
wilson: Cuddy feels guilty about not diagnosing psittacosis any earlier?
think so.
there's no way she could've.
no.
no way she could have.

# We might kiss #
# When we are alone #
it's raining.
# When nobody's watching #
# We might take it home #
# So why do you fill my sorrow #
# With the words you've borrowed #
# From the only place you've know #
# And why do you sing Hallelujah #
# If it means nothing to you #
# Why do you sing with me at all? #
Oh, he's gonna love it.
and it would be nice if you called him dad.
give me a big hug.
secret is the haas avocados.
I can e-mail you the recipe if you want.
Oh. This is the third time they've changed plans since friday.
these idiots think you can just add a 14th floor and the mayor won't notice.
I thought turning the garage into a nursery was complicated.
any luck on your end yet?
not for lack of trying.
Ted.
come on.
I have to go tell a client he's an idiot.
go kick some ass.
I have to take stella to karate by 3: 00
and birthday party at Julia's after.
you okay?
Yeah, I'll be back.
just make sure she's dressed.
Ah.
honey!
he's actually on time.
he's six minutes early.
something's happened. - I'm on it.
morning, jimmy.
anybody die while I was gone?
did--did you iron your shirt?
thought about shaving. Couldn't find a razor.
what the hell happened in baltimore?
sorry, chief. Never kiss and tell.
I think you just did.
there's no such thing as "just a kiss."
did you iron your shirt? Everybody's flash today.
has she left Mark? Is she going to?
I think I can hear cancer kids calling.
are you planning on asking her to leave mark?
not sure.
cameron keeps my calendar.
Hey, this is a big deal. This is an affair.
have you even talked to Stacy about what the hell this means?
didn't have a lot of time for talking.
if you know what I mean.
great. Breaking up a marriage. Fertile ground for high comedy.
we need to talk about this.
gosh, wish I could.
how did the hiv tests go?
did you study up?
I rescheduled for this afternoon. We have a new patient.
34-year-old female. Movement disorder.
movement disorder?
fascinating.
this isn't just gonna go away.
no. But maybe you will.
probably suffered head trauma in the car accident.
trauma leads to the dyskinesia.
according to her husband, the flailing started before she got anywhere near that car.
what does the flailing look like?
her arms spasm uncontrollably, and there's a mild facial twitch.
demonstration?
you want to know what it looks like, go see the patient.
Ooh, snarky.
was he like this the whole time I was gone?
patient's been a fertility regiment for the last 13 months.
excess estrogen in the system could explain-- - who finished the animal crackers?
sudden movement disorder could be a symptom of huntington'S.
if you finish something, don't just put back the empty box, throw it out.
Huntington's takes a day to confirm. We should put her on tamoxifen in case it is the fertility meds. Counteract the estrogen.
it's a great idea if you want to kill her baby.
movement disorder can present in the first trimester.
she's not pregnant.
peeing on a stick is only 99% accurate.
get a real pregnancy test.
you know, the one with the blood and the hormones and the rabbit.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's still your limo.
Whaddaya say, miss Daisy?
whatever you want.
lame duck's done quacking. - You quack, people shoot at you.
Cuddy just put me here to make you miserable.
another two days, you can go back to making yourself miserable.
okay. Get an mri.
see if it's in her head or in her uterus.
you're gonna want to paralyze her.
you run tests on a flailer, somebody's gonna lose an eye.
you think I'm pregnant?
we need to find out for sure.
would all this go away once she delivered?
it couldso be neurological. We need to get an mri.
can she do that if she's pregnant?
the risk to the fetus is extremely low.
but there is a risk.
I-I don't think we should do it until we're sure.
Ah.
Ted, I think you should take stella home.
I want to stay here. We should be with you.
you should take her out of the room.
we're going to temporarily stop margo's spasms.
you can do that? - Vecuronium.
it's a paralytic.
essentially cuts off the brain from the muscles.
don't worry. Your mom will be just fine.
it'll make running the tests easier.
and it won't be dangerous for the baby if you are pregnant.
let's go, stella. - I want to be with mommy.
we'll be just outside. We gotta let the doctors get her better.
it's okay, sweetie.
love you. - Love you.
your vitals will be watched closely.
I'm going to close your lids your eyesn't dry out.
just try to relax.
what the hell did you do?
were you just cold and lonely?
course he told you, he's an eight-year-old boy.
Hey, you're the one who kissed him.
why are you so worked up over this?
because you're married. - Not to you.
this is none of your business.
the last time you left,
I was the one stuck picking up the pieces.
Oh, right. He cried himself to sleep every night. That so sounds like him.
he's been pining for five years!
you' being dramatic. - No. Actually, I'm underplaying.
this is me being restrained.
it was one kiss.
are you being intentionally thick?
this was not just a one-night stand.
you can't toy with him. - I'm not.
he's probably toying with me.
I do--I don't know what I'm doing.
Oh, boy.
welcome back to the world. You're off the vecuronium.
could you wiggle your toes for me?
the mri was clear.
whatever this is isn't in your brain.
the mri.
so I'm not pregnant?
I'm sorry.
so what do we do next?
it could be a variety of things.
some treatable. Others more serious.
open up.
we're gonna run a genetic test for huntington's.
that one of the more serious ones? - Yeah.
it's also possible that this is just a symptom of the fertility treatments.
now that we know you're not pgnant, we're going to start you on tamoxifen to counteract the estrogen.
will that undo all the fertility treatments?
for the time being, yeah.
but it could cure you.
you can start trying again once we get you healthy.
damn it!
the spasms are going to get worse now that the vecuronium's wearing off.
what are you so scared of?
I'm still your mother. I'm just a little sick.
why did you even bring her here? I told you to leave her at home!
hypervigilance, sudden irritability
symptomatic of... lunch with Cuddy?
the patient now defines huntington'S.
then what do you need me for?
start her on huntington's meds.
before we get her test results back?
if we start her on valproic acid, it could destroy her liver.
could stroke.
if we wait, she could progress to full blown psychosis.
then her kid will never get the chance to say good-bye.
want to tell the class how that feels?
Huntington's patients don't progress to psychosis in a day.
she went from 0 to 60 in world-record time.
indicating it might be something other than huntington's.
we got a problem.
stay away from me.
Where's my daughter? What's happening?
she's having a psychotic break.
she is not yours. What do you ?
calm down. - Margo, you're gonna hurt someone.
push two milligrams of ativan.
I want my daughter!
she's not yours. I want my daughter.
no more experiments.
No!
how can her huntington's test be negative?
all the signs are there.
movement disorder, psychosis.
it should be huntington's.
Yeah. That'd certainly make your job easier.
well, good news for margo, it's not huntington's.
bad news for us.
her psychotic break eliminates fertility meds.
which means we have no idea what's wrong with her.
we give you so much. You give us so little.
you know, patient is prime age to develop spontaneous schizophrenia.
almost impossible.
no family history of mental illness.
how about toxins?
none of her family members are sick. Nobody at her office, her volunteer group, kid's classes, and pta members. All fine.
so she raises a daughter, runs a business, she does charity work.
she volunteers at school. Attends pta.
what makes mommy run?
you thinking drugs?
cocaine.
explains the psychosis and the flailing.
and the uncanny ability to bring home the bacon, fry it up in a pan, and never ever let Teddy forget that he's a man.
I'll go look for her stash.
take Foreman.
there's gotta be a reason for the stereotype.
I know you're in there.
I can hear you caring.
the door was locked.
means I didn't want to see anyone.
high school reunion?
it's for a patient. She can't roll.
now lock that door too.
paranoia.
must be the good stuff.
times like these, I wish i had cancer.
so what did she say?
that depends. What did you do, and who are we talking about?
we both know that as soon as we talked, you ran to Stacy so you could gossip and giggle.
I need to know what she said.
I have a crazy idea. Why don't you go talk to her?
because my bestest buddy says that could lead to trouble.
she sounds confused, but I don't think she is.
I think she's waiting for you to do something. Show her you're serious.
Wow.
it's a big jump from infidelity is morally wrong to do her.
I didn't say do her. I said do something.
what exactly did she say?
she didn't say it was a mistake.
she's not gonna leave Mark in the middle of his rehab.
too much guilt.
she left you.
harsh toke, dude.
house.
killjoy.
I could've covered this.
you need to get that test today.
I wish you guys remember my birthday instead of my hiv test.
forgive us for being concerned.
I got a bet with House.
he says you're too scared to get it.
I say you're too anal not to.
I'll cut you in.
that was a colossal waste.
who would've known?
searching a high end family home for illicit narcotics was such an obvious choice.
working moms practically live in their cars.
little bump on the run?
you were a car thief, right?
ha.
mama's little helper.
house.
Ritalin.
cocaine with a pg rating.
prescribed to her daughter.
mommy does everything for her family these days.
even swallows their pills.
it's possible the kid's meds are the kid's meds.
pop enough ritalin, it can explain everything.
well, ritalin maybe explains some tics, some involuntary
case reports have referred to chorea.
she's been cut off from her stash, so the flailing's tapered off and the psychosis hasn't returned. It's perfect.
tox screen will confirm that.
half-life's 12 hours. The drugs'll be out of her system.
we're done. Get rid of her.
we're not done.
we have to confirm the diagnosis before we send her home to die of something else.
Oh yes, the power tastes so sweet.
you just can't resist.
you're like a diabetic at the ice cream counter.
you want to say no, but you need that chocolaty goodness.
Yeah. Well, I'm still signing the charts.
so until tomorrow, you're not allowed to kill anyone.
wuss.
we've asked her three times if she's on any meds.
so we don't ask her.
candy striper.
so you like dogs?
that's not a dog.
smart kid.
are you always such a good little girl, or does mommy sometimes say you're the reason she needs a double martini?
who are you?
over here, kiddo. I'm talking to you.
focus.
it must be because you're off your meds.
who are you?
doctor and candy striper.
she's not on any medication.
well, that's strange cause this bottle has her name on it.
and I think these are medical pills inside.
what's he talking about?
doctor prescribed Stella...
a few months ago.
I never told you about it because I never gave her any.
hmm. That's funny cause the bottle's almost empty.
you missed a couple of days.
take five. - Stop.
do you need some water, sweetie? - I'm not taking ritalin.
come on.
all the cool moms are doing it. And tox screen says you're cool too.
you were on drugs while takingare of Stella?
I'm sorry, ted.
it's a cafeteria menu.
it should take a couple of hours to process her.
then you can take her home and divorce her.
working late?
or you just avoiding Mark?
it was one kiss, Greg.
so far.
I'm planning on keeping a chart.
I'm moving back to short hills. I think it's time.
you're leaving?
it's never meant to be permanent now that mark's getting better.
Yeah. Much better.
except for the whole walking thing.
he needs to get back to work.
right.
saving the next generation from making bad choices about acne cream.
you're running away because the kiss meant something.
I'm not running away. I'm going home.
with Mark.
I love Mark.
you love me more.
I don't want you to leave.
are we okay?
I'm sorry. - Let's just get you home.
that's a good idea.
mommy! - Hey!
call the code. - What's wrong, mommy?
what's going on?
this better be important.
you've gotta come back in.
no, I don'T. - Margo's stable, but
Oh, my god. Well, I'll be right there.
she had a stroke.
perfect.
gotta go back to work.
right now?
well patient's stable.
could maybe wait a half hour.
he should've been here 20 minutes ago.
doubt if he makes it all.
I saw him leave with Stacy.
he's probably just walking her to her car.
Oh, yeah. That sounds like House.
he's not an idiot. He's not going to hook up with a married woman.
I hope he is getting some. Maybe he'll mellow out.
what took you so long? It's midnight.
traffic.
you owe me 100 bucks.
you didn't take the test?
fear trumps anal every time.
it's not a big deal.
I had the viral load and antibody tests.
99. 9% that I don't have hiv.
and if you had the test and it's negative, you gain a tenth of a point.
but if it's positive, you lose...
nearly 100, right?
no arrhythmia.
so ritalin isn't the big problem.
something else is going on.
fine.
let's play doctors.
I removed the clot which caused the stroke.
problem is, we don't know where it came from.
did ultrasounds of her heart, arms, and legs. All clear.
could be a protein c deficiency.
wouldn't explain the movement disorder.
nothing explains everything.
what if it's a crime syndicate?
let's say ritalin and the fertility meds plotted a caper.
ritalin takes care of the psychosis, the flailing.
I still don't think ritalin-- - fertility meds are competitive by nature.
they gotta do something bigger. Something really unexpected.
fertility treatments have been known to cause endometrial cancer.
which could cause clots.
which could've caused her to stroke.
so ultrasound her uterus this time.
see if there's something growing in there at doesn't look adorable a ones.
Cameron.
I love you.
get your test results tomorrow.
the prescription for my heart condition.
a bit on the cheesy side.
I was trying for romantic.
still fits.
did you tell Mark?
I told him I had to work late.
you going to tell him?
how am I going to tell him?
still working on that phrasing.
how about,"know all the stuff"you worried about when we first came here, honey, you were right.
pithy.
everything's easy when you don't care if you hurt anyone.
you already did the hurting part.
he just doesn't know yet. - If I never tell hi it'll never hurt.
I want not to love mark.
I want to hate you. I want allf this to be simple, but it's not.
you can either have a life with me, or you can have a life with him.
it can't be both.
it's that easy. But it is simple.
no endometrial thickening.
no masses. - No cancer.
she's on fertility treatments. She had a blood clot. It's there.
millions of women are on fertility treatments, and they don't get cancer.
right. They get babies.
she had a blood clot and a stroke.
she'll get another one and probably die if we don't find that tumor.
do an endometrial biopsy.
biopsy's painful and unnecessary.
we just did an ultrasound.
what? - Ssh.
if you have a person issue that's interfering with
SSH, ssh, ssh.
what are we waiting for?
your four weeksjust expired.
your reign of terror is over.
mine is just begun.
no go stick a needle up her hoo-hoo and find that cancer.
Hoo-hoo?
he went to hopkins.
...has got 1, 500 horsepower blown and injected with alcohol.
Yeah, that baby really moves.
Oh yeah, the transmission...
what are you watching?
TV.
what are you doing here?
Ted's with my mom.
he asked the nurse to watch me.
what nurse?
she's not really watching me.
I got that.
do you still have the balloons?
no.
you want play something? - No.
when can mommy come home?
don't know.
what's wrong with your foot?
war wound. - Does it hurt?
every day.
is that why you're so sad?
Oh, aren't you adorable.
I'm not sad, I'm complicated.
chicks dig that.
one day, you'll understand.
that's what my parents say when they don't want me to know something.
they say that a lot?
only when they're talkingabout making babies and stuff.
when you catch them fighting?
they don't fight.
not ever?
people who love each other don't fight.
right. Forgot that.
what floor was that nurse onwho was watching you?
two.
good talk.
at your age, the type of uterine cancer that develops is not likely to metastasize.
it's very treatable.
hold still, Margo.
I'm--I'm feeling a little bit dizzy.
Oh, my god.
bp's dropping.
what's going on?
get him out of here.
what's going on? - heart rate's 98 and rising.
we gotta find that bleed.
What'd you do? Hit an artery?
with what? I hadn't even started the procedure.
Oh!
I need some advice.
whatever it is, can it wait?
Yeah.
what was Greg like after I left?
uh, an egomaniacal narcissistic pain in the ass.
same as before you left.
do you think he's capable of having a real relationship?
what happened in baltimore?
nothing. - Right.
maybe something. - Right.
technically, most of the something happened after baltimore.
Oh god, Stacy.
I don't know what to do.
are you seriously thinking about leaving Mark?
no. I don't know.
I can't.
and you want me to tell you it's okay?
it wasn't all bad with Greg. I was with him for a reason.
you left him for a reason.
I could swear I remember him being fun.
sorry for the scare.
just tell me she's okay.
ultrasound showed the bleed was coming from her liver.
it's rare, but t blood got into her fallopian tubes.
in a way, it was lucky. Let us know we were looking in the wrong place.
the tumor's in her liver.
is it cancer?
we're running some more tests.
there it is.
it's a liver tumor.
if it's malignant, at least she's only gonna leave one child without a mother.
do a biopsy.
we can't.
it's vascular.
house.
what?
I'm here about Stacy.
what about her?
I think I'm losing her.
your wife, your problem.
she won't talk to me.
so what, you're gonna talk to me instead? Talk to your shrink.
she keeps saying everything's fine.
find a bar and talk to a stranger.
you're the only one who's been through this.
I'm shutting her out.
I'm saying things and then hating myself for saying them.
how did you get past that?
didn't.
can you please be a human being for one minute and talk to me?
sorry. Gotta go. People dying.
you're not gonna outrun me.
house.
you're not ready for this.
I've seen the way you and Stacy talk to each other.
you're an idiot.
you probably just set your rehab back three months.
let go of me! Get off of me!
a" plus "b" does not equal liver tumor.
we gotta solve for X.
we gotta look at this differently.
what do we know about her?
side effects of ritalin caused the
no. We've examined the file up and down.
come here. Give me that.
why do you people always overlook the human element?
what do we know about her?
Margo...
Dalton. The woman.
she's a people pleaser.
she doesn't like to let people down.
who never fights with her husband.
she went to drugs instead of asking for help to manage her life.
so if she can't manage now, why does she want another kid?
foreman.
need your help here.
you want to pull a bank job.
would you go it alone?
if you're gonna rob a home, sure. It's a one or two man crew.
but a bank...
lookout, getaway driver.
I'm not saying anything until the metaphor plays itself out.
so here's the caper.
fertility meds create a distraction.
mommy had three refills on the ritalin in the last three weeks.
that team goes straight for the top floor.
has no problem taking out communications.
but they also need a specialist.
safe cracker.
all this guy does is stroke, blood clot, liver tumor.
foreman was right.
this bad ass even does flling.
come on.
only one guy I know does that kind of work.
birth control pills?
while the surgeons are cutting out a chunk of your liver, should I have them do a hysterectomy too?
a hysterectomy?
I'm trying to get pregnant.
you don't have to lie to me.
we're not married.
you're super mom.
you can do anything.
you work seven days a week.
you volunteer. Raise a kid.
yet you still somehow find the time to lieto hubby number two that you really really want to give him a child with his chin and pretty brown eyes.
what makes you think that I-- - because it fits.
birth control pills caused hepatocellular adenoma.
explains all your symptoms that aren't explained
that's it?
also.
I'll have the tuna on rye.
would you like to leave my room now?
tumor is benign.
stop taking the pill, and it'll go away on its own. I'm canceling the surgery.
what are you going to tell my husband?
that I'm canceling the surgery.
you can do the explaining.
it's tricky, huh?
it's one thing to say you can't have a baby.
it's another to say you don't want one.
personally, I'd make up some other lie.
could
could I die on the table?
could you die if you tell him the truth?
I need the surgery.
I'm not on the pill.
you can't cancel the surgery.
if she goes off the pill, the tumor goes away on its own.
you have no proof the birth control pills caused this.
you have no proof she's even taking them.
well, if we do the survey, maybe we'll kill her on the table.
then I can prove I'm right at the autopsy.
or we can forget the surgery, let the tumor grow, and kill her.
why don't you take iup with Stacy?
see which option minimizes your risk.
here's what I think she's going to say.
Oh, I love Greg.
but if you go against a patient's wishes, you're calling her a liar.
and if something goes wrong,
I end up in court having to defend the big, mean doctor albeit with dreamy eyes who wouldn't believe the nice suburban mom.
and even though his cane makes me melt, do the damn surgery.
shocking.
it's benign.
people do crazy things for love.
no. Crazy is hanging out at the park all day talking to pigeons.
Rgo knowswhat she's doing.
she gave up half her liver to save her marriage.
no. She surgically removed her fingerprints to cover her pathetic lie.
it's twisted and manipulative, I get that.
but it's also...
romantic.
I'm barely willing to put the seat down after I pee.
do we need to talk? - Nope. I'm fine.
so the surgeon got the whole tumor.
and it was benign. - That's good, right?
Yeah. Benign is good.
how could a benign tumor have caused all the symptoms?
we believe all your wife's symptoms will go away now.
Oh. Thank god.
look. I'm gonna pick up Stella.
I'll call you after I get the baby-sitter.
Dr. Foreman, you can help me.
you could tell my husband that...
because of all this...
I can't take any more fertility treatments.
confidentiality rules stop me from telling your husband the truth.
but my obligation to lie ends there.
are--are there
is there a birth control method, something that won't make me sick?
Margo, you're gonna have risks with everything.
especially if you're not telling your fertility doctor.
if you keep doing this, it's gonna kill your marriage and kill you.
you don't know.
in a few years, we'll give up, stoprying to get pregnant.
we'll hug, cry.
eventually, Ted will stop thinking about it.
and he'll appreciate Stella even more.
and we'll live happily together for the next 50 years.
something you need to see.
knowing is always better than not knowing.
it's a referral request.
right.
hiv thing came in earlier.
you're fine.
you won't read your mail, but you'll open mine?
it said confidential.
I wanted to know.
the most important letter of my life.
and you're still an ass.
comforting, isn't it?
Hey.
Hi.
I'm going to talk to Mark tonight.
then I'm going to stay here with you.
don't do it.
this isn't funny, Greg.
I know.
you...
spent all these months chasing me. Now I'm here and you start running.
what the hell changed?
nothing.
nothing changes.
I'm not going to change.
who asked you to?
mark is willing to do whatever it takes.
I'm not.
never was.
now you're introspective? Weren't so analytical the other night.
you were happy with Mark. You'll be happy again.
shut up about Mark. What the hell's wrong with you?
I can't make you happy.
what?
how do you think this is gonna end?
we'll be happy for what?
a few weeks, few months.
and then I'll say something insensitive, or I'll start ignoring you.
and at first it'll be okay.
it's just House being House.
and then at some point, you will need something more.
you'll need someone who can give you something I can'T.
you know I'm right. I've been there before.
Oh.
it doesn't have to be.
it does.
it does.
I don't want to go there again.
I'm sorry, Stacy.
50 bucks says they're divorced in a year.
six months tops.
I'll take that bet.
it's the perfect marriage.
there nothing to fight over if you never talk about anything.
what did you tell her?
I told her she's better off without me.
huh.
that's probably true.
you're an idiot.
you don't think she'd be better off without you.
right. I set her off on a whim.
you have no idea why you sent her off.
don't do this. - This was no great sacrifice.
you sent her away because you've got to be miserable.
that kind of psycho-crap help get your paents through the long nights?
or is it just for you?
tough love make you feel good? Helping people feel their pain.
you don't like yourself.
but you do admire yourself.
it's all you've got, so you cling to it.
you're so afraid if you change, you'll lose what makes you special.
being miserable doesn't make you better than everybody else, House.
it just makes you miserable.
you're weight is 1-1-3. 9 pounds.
are you gonna make me hurt you?
I didn't think so.
No!
are you all right?
did I hurt you?
Bob, what's wrong?
what happened? Talk to me.
Oh, my God.
okay, honey, hang on, hang on.
911. What is your emergency?
Yes, we need an ambulance at 10600 Xavier, unit 4B!
my husband can't breathe.
Oh, my God! He's turning blue.
you have to send someone now! Please, hurry!
you blow dry your hair?
Oh, sorry, did I wake you up?
you blow dry your hair?
excuse me for actually caring what I look like.
I think the word you're looking for is obsessing.
been at it for almost an hour.
if you wanted in, all you had to do is say so.
I don't want in. I want sleep.
it's about time you got up anyway.
it's almost 9: 00.
this isn't gonna work.
what?
you. Staying here.
you're kicking me out?
after one night?
what, you think we should try counseling first?
why do you want to sleep on a couch anyway?
you got money.
at least until the divorce is finalized.
I'll be out of your hair tomorrow. What's left of it.
it was three days ago.
my throat got really dry and then my tongue felt like it was blowing up like a balloon.
I assume somebody checked for food allergies?
well, the first two doctors, both did.
next one said it was a panic attack.
the one after that wanted to take his tonsils out.
the last one had no idea.
he just referred us to Dr. House.
it says the attack was preceded by some sort of strenuous physical activity.
Um...yeah.
what were you doing?
awesome.
a sex fiend with a swollen tongue.
just think of all the places I can make Foreman search.
he's not a sex fiend. He's a happily married man.
no such thing.
What're you doing?
testing a new caffeine delivery system.
he didn't get his beauty sleep.
Wilson's moved in and apparently has unusually loud toenails.
if they're into rape fantasies, S&M is on the menu as well.
neck trauma could cause vocal chords paroxysms, which could cause choking.
I didn't see any sign of trauma, and they were remarkably open.
I asked about STDs, and they admitted participating in a three some a few months ago.
hundred bucks says they're as miserable as the next couple.
another guy or girl?
girl. His wife's college roommate.
if he's not happily married, I don't know who could be.
they're looking for something.
if you're happy, you got nothing to look for.
his wife arranged it for an anniversary present.
and if you ask me, if two people really trust each other, a threesome once every seven years might actually help a marriage.
okay, I say we stop the DDX and discuss that comment.
I'll take the bet.
maybe the first doctor was right.
a food allergy explains the anaphylaxis.
could be neurological.
progressive Bulbar Paralysis would explain the symptoms.
no. ALS would affect his facial muscles before his throat.
what if the problem's not in his throat?
that'd be a little odd considering that's where all his symptoms are.
says who?
the patient.
since most patients can't tell their ulna from their anus,I'm guessing this guy also doesn't know the difference between choking and suffocating.
his throat might be fine. His lungs might be messed up.
get more blood, a chest CT, and a body plethysmograph.
unless of course, you think we should be asking the patient where his anus is first.
it, uh, feels like I have to urinate, and then when I try to go
pull up your pants.
it's my prostate, isn't it?
Nope. Not your prostate.
herpes.
herpes?
herpes.
your turn.
if it makes you feel any better, half the patients who come into this place have some sort of crotch rot.
uh, no, it doesn't.
look, this is impossible.
I've been married for 20 years.
you had any sex in those 20 years?
Yes, of course.
then that's how you got it.
the only person I've had sex with is my wife.
bummer.
take this once a day.
tell your wife to do the same.
it's not gonna cure it, but it'll lessen the frequency of the outbreaks.
but there must be some mistake.
you got any kids?
Yeah.
any of them take guitar lessons?
no.
tennis, art, acting?
my daughter does karate.
Why?
give this to her sensei.
Oh, wait.
does your wife play tennis?
no.
that's what I figured.
it never hurts to make sure.
[rip of paper] For Miyagi.
I'm gonna close the shutter now.
I need you to pant. Kind of like a dog.
that's good. Keep going.
can I ask you a personal question?
uh, I guess.
the, um...the threesome.
and...The role playing.
is that because things get boring?
no.
we just...enjoy our fantasies.
you married? - No.
you can go back to taking the deep breaths now.
marriages don't fail because couples get bored.
they fail because... while they're dating, people pretend to be the person they think their partner wants and then...well
there's only so long you can keep that up.
maybe they are that person while they're dating, but then they change.
people thinking their partner will change?
that's another reason marriages fail.
people don't change.
at least not in any way that really matters.
I think you've had enough caffeine.
you were right.
it's not his throat. It's his lungs.
plethysmograph revealed decreased lung capacity.
and the CT showed lung scarring.
it's definitely interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
what's not definite is the cause.
there's no arthritis, no sarcoidosis.
uh, he's not on any prescription meds.
and he's a wedding photographer so I doubt he got exposed to coal dust or asbestos at work.
cause could be idiopathic.
can't be idiopathic.
idiopathic means without a known cause.
what I meant was that
what you meant was you don't know what the cause is.
just say that, and we can avoid this conversation.
no applause?
what's his current condition?
stable.
then we can wait.
wait for what?
for whatever you can't figure out to cause something else.
you know it's going to.
it's possible the IPF could just continue to
there's something wrong with his skin.
okay, stop scratching. I gotta look at it.
I can't! This is driving me crazy.
stop scratching so
make it stop! Okay
make it stop!
something to discuss.
what causes both lung scarring and the itchy splotchy red blotchies?
it's obviously not a reaction to medication.
we haven't given him any yet.
but what besides what it's obviously not can cause both lung scarring and the splotchies?
where are you going?
to complete the second half of the caffeine delivery system.
either talk louder or get in here!
same color coming out as going in.
you think that's a marketing thing?
lupus could cause lung scarring and a rash.
or it could still be a food allergy.
we've already ruled out allergies.
did we?
Where's Cameron?
we're in the men's room.
we need an allergy expert in here!
this can wait two minutes.
you don't know that.
chase thinks that food allergies should still be on the table.
no, it wouldn't explain the lung scarring.
some homeopathic studies have found a connection between food allergies and autoimmune reactions, which could cause lung inflammation. Yeah.
and some homeopathic studies have also found that ground-up spiders can cure cancer.
can I go now?
no.
lungs, skin. Skin, lungs.
Sklungs?
lungs, skin.
throat.
heavy metal toxicity.
it explains the lungs, the itching.
the swelling in his tongue and throat.
I thought you didn't believe there was anything wrong with this throat.
I never said I didn't believe it.
I just said I had good reason to doubt it.
and now?
and now I have good reason to doubt those doubts.
patient's a little old to be chewing paint off the walls.
nor does he drink well water or eat fish every day or do anything else that could've exposed him to heavy metals.
he and his wife worked a wedding in Cabo San Lucas last month.
a lot of pottery in Mexico is contaminated with lead-based paint.
now aren't you glad you joined us?
search their house and screen his blood and hair for lead.
and test for mercury and arsenic while you're at it.
find out what the resort cooks with, and if they have repainted recently or did any plumbing repairs.
I don't speak Spanish.
then it'll be challenging.
good Lord.
what is that smell?
stuffed pepper.
stuffed with what?
vomit?
thought you were going to a hotel.
I found an apartment.
I can move in on Monday.
is that fast enough for you?
what's today?
Where'd you get all that stuff?
well, not from your kitchen.
don't you ever eat anything besides canned soup and peanut butter?
don't you eat anything that doesn't look like it's been rolled onto your plate by a dung beetle?
try it.
it's good, isn't it?
no.
just better than it looks.
how much beans and rice do you think you'd have to eat from a ceramic pot painted with lead-based paint to get enough lead into your system to damage your lungs?
are we talking a child or an adult?
adult.
then I'd say a lot.
you'd have to beans every day for months.
now, why do you have a season pass to the New Yankee workshop?
it's a complete moron working with power tools.
how much more suspenseful can you get?
I'm--I was watching something. No...
you were about to watch something.
I'm watching something.
see the difference?
if the water was contaminated, wouldn't I be sick too?
people can metabolize toxins at different rates.
we'll test it to be sure.
have you done any recent renovations?
no.
have any problem with bugs or rodents?
just the occasional ant.
use bug spray?
no. I hate the smell.
luckily both of us are pretty anal.
Yeah, I can tell.
you think ants are the problem?
can you stop stuffing your mouth with pancakes for one second?
these aren't pancakes.
these are macadamia nut pancakes.
Wilson made 'em and they're amazing.
she said she doesn't use bug spray, but
silver dollar slices of heaven.
some ants are poisonous. Maybe
forget the 72 virgins.
if I blow myself up in a crowded restaurant,
I'm gonna be asking for a plate of these babies.
is the ant big and red or small and black?
medium and brown.
halle Berry brown or Beyonc? brown?
is there a difference?
is there a difference?
army ants could devour, dissolve, eat a cow in a matter of hours.
australian bull ants on the hand are nasty little bastards, but they're more of a nuisance than a threat.
no surprise there.
Beyonc?
well, then that's not it.
how much clay did he eat at the resort?
it's a five-star, 400-a-night place.
they don't cook with ceramic pots.
tox screen?
no evidence of lead, mercury, or arsenic.
run 'em again.
call the resort.
find some disgruntled employee to talk to.
go back to the home.
it's not heavy metals.
Thesymptomssay it is.
Thetestssay it's not.
well, who you gonna believe?
the symptoms or the tests?
could also be a food allergy.
cameron says it's not.
if your tests can be wrong, why can't hers?
his diet hasn't changed since he was a kid.
his favorite food is Corn Flakes.
which I assume he eats with milk, one of the most common adult onset food allergies.
start treating him for lead poisoning.
it's the most likely heavy metal.
and yeah, you can test him for allergies for dairy, wheat, and legume.
I am not having an affair with my daughter's karate instructor, and I did not give my husband herpes.
found out where House is.
if your convinced it's allergies, why're you giving him drugs to treat lead poisoning?
we're not convinced of anything, yet.
I think I need something else. This cream isn't working.
we're doing everything we can.
sorry.
no, no, it's not my back. It's my feet.
I think I stepped in something when I went to the bathroom.
uh, it's on my socks. It's burning!
I don't see anything.
please take my socks off.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
Ow! Stop.
what did you just scratch him with?
if there was an allergic reaction, it'd be on his back, not on his feet.
Oh, God, it's burning! Please make it stop.
gonna need some gabapentin in here.
excruciating pain in the lower extremities.
not a sign of a food allergy.
means there's a neurological problem.
more significantly, it's yet another classic sign of heavy metals.
and I just did yet another hair and blood test for lead and everything else he could possibly have been exposed to.
it's gotta be something else.
lupus could cause-- No.
lupus progresses slower. There'd be joint pain.
so it's not a typical case.
we should get an ANA
it's not lupus.
symptoms don't match.
and the tests don't match heavy metals.
it's happening again.
he's not breathing!
tongue's swelling, airways closing.
he's not getting any air.
his lungs are clear.
we're gonna have to intubate.
try to relax, Bob, this is gonna help you breathe.
Oh, my God!
he's gonna aspirate. Need suction!
what's happening?
suction.
there's too much vomit.
we're never going to be able to intubate.
we need to trach him.
he's not breathing.
his urine has elevated proteins and red blood cells.
it's lupus-induced kidney failure.
if we don't start treatment
heavy metal toxicity could cause vomiting.
and so would lupus nephritis, and it also causes tissue swelling.
he's choking on his tongue, not his feet
the corticosteroids we gave him to control the inflammation can cause facial swelling.
it's still not his throat, but you're getting closer.
I'm doing an ANA and a serum compliment.
if you're so sure, why waste time with tests?
just start treatment.
Oh, no, wait, we can't do that because we already have and it's not working. Ergo
corticosteroids aren't the only treatment for lupus nephritis.
we could also try cyclophosphamide or immunosuppressants.
only if we confirm the diagnosis with an ANA, serum compliment, anti-DNA, IV pyelogram, and kidney biopsy.
so now you suddenly believe in tests?
the symptoms
the symptoms all point to heavy metal poisoning.
Yeah, we all get it.
unless you've got proof and can tell me which heavy metal it is,
I'm starting treatment for lupus.
systemic lupus erythematosus causes the immune system to become hyperactive.
attack normal tissue.
it could be what caused the lung inflammation as well as the swelling in his throat and now what appears to be damage to his kidneys.
the treatment's usually steroids.
but he's already on steroids.
if the tests confirm we're on the right track, there are other medications we can try.
and if those don't work?
well, lupus is a chronic condition, but it's generally controllable.
what do you mean, generally?
in rare cases, it can cause cardiovascular or renal failure.
cardiovascular and...renal.
that's, uh, the heart and the kidneys, right?
Yeah.
don't worry.
it'll be all right.
enjoying the salad?
there's no lettuce.
I'm aware that there's no lettuce!
do you know when I obtained this knowledge?
actually, I'm in the middle of
when I made it.
for myself.
well, how was I supposed to know?
well...I was hoping
this might tip you off.
that's kind of selfish. Don't you think?
I offered to make you some.
you said no.
Ah, that was before I tasted the pancakes.
it's a compliment, you should be flattered.
here.
it's Mrs. Lambert's herpes test results.
Mrs. who?
you've told more than one patient his wife is sleeping with his daughter's karate teacher?
you wanna stir the pot, you have to clean up the mess.
what would you do if you got herpes?
she's coming in at 5: 00, don't make me come looking for you.
actually, I know what you'd do.
but I mean a normal guy
and don't be calling in sick, or saying that your team needs you for some kind of emergency consult.
if he suspected that maybe his wife had also been playing pickle games, he could just keep it on the down low.
at least wait till she got infected.
you'd give your own wife herpes just to shift the blame onto
Oh, he'd give his own mother herpes if it got him out of clinic duty.
of course, maybe it was the wife.
maybe she was the one who
Where's Mrs. Nympho?
she's waiting outside. Why?
go search her.
what, you mean her medical records?
if I meant that, good chance I'd have said that.
you think she's poisoning him?
his symptoms should be getting better the longer he's here.
instead they're getting worse.
so either she's poisoning him or
it's not heavy metals.
we've done over ten different heavy metal tox screens
because there's no reason to test for the other 30.
they don't get into the air or food.
they only get in you if someone puts them in you.
and the only way we're going to find out what she's been sprinkling on his corn flakes
I am not going to accuse a woman of trying to murder her own husband
it's the only explanation.
we've eliminated every other possibility.
we have not eliminated every other possibility.
has he responded to the latest lupus treatment?
he's only been on it for a few hours.
he hasn't responded because it's not lupus.
it's not allergies, ALS, arthritis, or sarcoidosis.
she's all that's left.
do it!
I'm Dr. House.
mind if I take a look in your purse?
Why?
because I'm going to need to search it and you for whatever you're using to poison your husband.
Whywould I want to hurt my husband?
then you won't mind if I search your things.
go ahead.
you satisfied?
absolutely not.
she agreed to let me search everywhere else, but this she says no to.
doesn't that tell you something?
Yes, that she doesn't want some lunatic doctor searching her vagina with a flashlight.
Oh, Cameron could do that.
I'm not going to
the woman hasn't left the hospital since they arrived.
whatever she's using, she's obviously hiding somewhere.
she's not poisoning him.
it's the only explanation.
no, it's the only explanation your twisted mind can come up with because you're angry that you can't find the answer, and you're taking it out on her.
and you are protecting a complete stranger based on some childishly romantic notion that people are all so happily married they don't want to kill each other.
you calling me childish?
grow up.
shut up.
both of you.
and stay away from his wife.
sorry. I'm not giving you permission to assault someone.
let's see.
I'm thinking Colonel Mustard in the music room with the candlestick.
there's no music room. It's the conservatory.
same thing. No, it isn't.
if we don't find out what she's using and start treatment immediately, he'll be dead in a week.
if you're right.
if Foreman's right, you'd have basically raped an innocent woman.
my wife fired the maid.
apparently she's getting rid of everything that reminds her of me.
you did your maid?
I was nice to our maid, which...annoyed her.
God knows why.
maybe she was doing her.
no one was doing her.
all right? But, you still feel responsible.
even though nothing or no one was done, it's still your fault.
I offered to keep paying her salary until she found another job.
but she refused to take any money without doing any work, so
want someone to clean your apartment?
it's on me.
you're supposed to moving out, not moving more people in.
she's not moving in. She's gonna clean.
maybe I should just move out, and the the two of you
Oh, God! [machine beeps]
Oh, God, no.
call a code!
Oh, God, please.
charge it to 360. Give him epi.
clear!
still no pulse.
charging.
clear!
I got a pulse.
pupils are reactive.
you still with us?
he was without oxygen for less than a minute.
it can't be hypoxia.
could be a stroke.
honey, can you hear me?
Bob, talk to me.
honey, please.
Bob, can you hear me?
he's awake.
can you hear me?
honey?
Yes.
she is...quite the little actress.
she's not poisoning him.
there's nothing more to discuss.
we've got lung and kidney failure, neurological symptoms, and now cardiac arrest.
a systemic disease with multi-organ involvement is thedefinitionof lupus.
autoimmune suppressants aren't helping.
we should start him on cyclophosphamide.
see if it makes a difference.
Yeah. And interferon.
interferon isn't an approved treatment for lupus.
you're not still thinking
interferon isn't an approved treatment for heavy metal toxicity either.
true.
but it's pretty much the only thing we can do for a viral infection.
we didn't consider it because
because it doesn't make sense. There's no fever.
because he's got no immune system.
thanks to the immunosuppressants youprescribed for lupus treatment.
he didn't present with a fever either.
because atthatpoint, he was a post-viral autoimmune reaction.
which again
thanks to the immunosuppressants you prescribed for lupus treatment, his immune system basically rolled out the red carpet for the dormant virus, waking it up, turning it into a present viral infection.
give him interferon.
but if itislupus, interferon could make it worse.
suppress his bone marrow even further.
which is more likely?
a rapidly progressing, acute-onset lupus in a patient who's already on steroids, or a team of doctors missing a post-viral reaction?
we didn't miss anything.
well then, I'm wrong and you shouldn't
give him interferon!
intravenous interferon has been shown to be effective against some viral infections.
but, I thought you said it wasn't an infection.
you said it was lupus.
the increasingly rapid progression of the symptoms has caused us to reconsider.
and what if you're wrong here too?
what if it's not a virus?
there are risks with interferon.
especially in a patient who's already immunosuppressed.
look, at this point, you're lungs, kidneys, and heart are all failing.
we really don't have any choice.
[hoarsely] I cheated.
what?
9th grade...earth science.
Mr. Foley.
I sat behind you so I could cheat off of you.
and I let you cheat... so you'd sit behind me.
I thought we were gonna grow old together.
in 9th grade?
no. 10th.
what, you had to make sure I put out first?
no.
I knew you put out in the 7th grade.
I love you.
Yeah, I know.
say you love me.
no. [crying]
why not?
because... you're not dying.
say it anyway.
you gonna make me hurt you?
I love you.
it's not working.
both his lungs and kidneys are continuing to deteriorate.
up the dose.
we already have.
apparently not enough.
I don't think it's a virus. We've been titers for everything we could think of. They're all negative.
increase the interferon.
you got a better idea? Other than lupus?
no.
then up the dose.
Mr. and Mrs. Lambert's appointment was over an hour ago.
sorry. I was sick.
and my team needed an emergency consult.
your wife has herpes.
what?
that-- That's impossible. I don't have any
you haven't had an outbreak...yet.
don't worry, you will.
you rutty jackass!
me? I haven't been with anyone in 20 years!
but you're the one with the blisters on his
doesn't mean that he got it first.
you don't need to have an outbreak to spread the virus.
Yeah!
and you're the one always talking about wanting more sex.
from you.
and maybe I'd get more if you weren't actually getting it somewhere else.
well, you two obviously have a lot to talk about.
don't even think about dumping this on my lap.
there's gotta be someway to prove that it'shim.
I'm sorry. There is no test.
either you two ever sit on a public toilet?
of course.
herpes can live for short periods of time outside the body.
Dr. House, you know you can't get herpes
some politically correct doctors will tell you that it's impossible to get infected by a toilet seat, but they'll also tell you not to use the same bath towel to dry your crotch and your face during an outbreak.
see the contradiction?
I always use a paper cover.
always? Yes, of course.
what about you?
no.
I never knew.
Oh, please. This is ridiculous.
damn. I was sure it was Miyagi.
what?
he could believe that you can herpes from a toilet seat, or he could be cheating on you and just be happy to have an out.
the toilet seat makes sense, doesn't it?
sure, but she'd only refused to believe such a well presented lie if she were innocent.
and since you both can't be innocent...
you rutty jackass.
Oh, you
thanks a lot.
my pleasure.
honey. Wait!
please.
not bad.
she has a family history of arthritis, doesn't she?
Yeah, she does. What does--?
stop the interferon.
do another heavy metal screen.
only this time, test for gold.
you don't still think that she
and don't let her go to the bathroom.
why would you care if she
Hello?
I'm Lady.
What'd you do to my closet?
I cleaned it.
uh, Dr. Wilson said that I could go ahead
it's not Dr. Wilson's closet!
Where's the wood box?
a wood box?
Yes, the wood box.
it's made of wood, and it's box-shaped.
it's been in the back of this closet since the day I moved in.
I didn't see any kind of wood
you may not have seen it, but you've obviously moved it.
the question is where?
well, I did not move anything, I just
look, it was in this closet.
then you came. Now it's not in this closet.
okay, uh-- What type of box?
wood! Wood!
it's a brown wood box.
it's got a metal handle on the top.
it looks like a-- like a tackle or a toolbox.
Ah, you mean the chest?
the one that's under the bed?
do you need to fix something?
um. Thanks.
well, fine, then I'll go to one on another floor.
well, actually, they're not working there either.
Everybathroom in thewhole hospital is out of order?
well, they're, um
the water
I'm going to the bathroom.
where is she?
she had to go to the bathroom.
I told you not to let her.
what was I supposed to do?
tie her up?
why not? She likes that.
what are you doing?
uh, your hand is wet.
sorry. Must be nervous.
I got some bad news.
what?
the damage to your husband's lungs is permanent.
the kidney damage is reversible, and with the right therapy, he should regain full neurological function.
other than the fact that he's not gonna be running any marathons, he should be fine.
but that's good news, isn't it?
I'm not finished.
when I was a kid, my dad was stationed in a Marine base in Egypt.
we were in the middle of nowhere, and there was absolutely nothing for a kid to do except...
look for a mummy's tomb.
you didn't want me to go to the bathroom because you wanted to tell me my husband is going to be fine and that...you used to live in Egypt?
I didn't have a problem with you going to the bathroom.
I just didn't want you to wash your hands.
I never actually found a mummy.
but, I did learn a fair amount about the ancient Egyptians.
for example, they discovered that stannous chloride is not only great for toughening ruby glass, but if it's mixed with gold, it turns bright purple.
now either, your fingers actually are worth their weight in gold, or you've been sprinkling your husband's cereal with gold sodium thiomalate.
it's an arthritis remedy that it's rarely used here in the in the U. S. but it's still popular in Mexico.
gotta give you props.
I've never heard of anyone using gold before.
it's almost...
poetic.
it's ridiculous.
heavy metal tox screen for gold was off the chart.
why would I
because you were trying to kill him.
I'd love to know the why behind that why.
but, you're not gonna tell me, are you?
you're wrong. I
I love Bob.
I never said you didn't love him.
how does somebody do that?
sit by someone's bedside day and night, helping them, comforting them, and at the same time killing them.
maybe he was having an affair.
maybe she was having an affair.
or maybe she just gets her kicks out of slowly sucking the life out of a guy, watching him suffer.
he must've done something to her.
Yeah, he had it coming.
I didn't say he deserved it.
the only thing he did wrong was marry a sociopath.
or maybe she just got tired of being married.
didn't want to admit to family and friends that the marriage everyone thought was perfect wasn't.
shouldn't of us stay with her?
what is she tries to run?
Yeah. Cameron, go back there.
it'd be weird if we were all in the ladies' room.
we started chelation therapy with dimercaprol.
thrilled to hear it.
his kidney function hasn't improved.
it will.
he's gonna need a lung transplant.
he's becoming more attractive by the minute, isn't he?
you're pleased.
you think you've proved every marriage is a mistake.
do I look pleased?
ignorance is bliss.
you have one new message. [beep]
Hi, this is Blake Hanson calling for Dr. Wilson.
I got a better offer for the apartment.
now, I know offered it to you already, so if you match the offer, you can still have the place.
make sure you call me first thing in the morning and let me know, Message deleted.
Hey, guys!
guess he got away.
can baby shoes come out to play?
come on.
hands on your head, climb out.
I can't climb out if my hands are on my head.
just keep 'em where i can see 'em, man.
go 'head. Go 'head. Come on.
you high, popo?
Yeah, man.
catchin' morons makes me high.
take your shirt off by your collar and turn around.
whoo, would you look at that!
dude's got a weapon.
all right, you have the right to remain...stupid!
watch the gun.
anything you say will be completely incomprehensible.
seriously, man, careful!
seriously, man? Seriously?
does your mama know what you do?!
Aww...that's sweet.
your dad's proud. You made the local paper. --From my article.
give it a rest.
you read what he wrote in the margin?
our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up.
he's not proud of me. He's proud of Jesus.
everything I do right is god's work.
everything I do wrong is my own damn fault.
cop with a sense of humor.
differential diagnosis.
guy's in the E. R. Bleeding on everybody.
drugs?
he's a cop.
good point. How about...drugs?
tox screen was clean.
he did, however, get hit by a bullet.
just mentioning it.
he was shot?
no, somebody threw it at him.
I'm thinking trauma. He's got bullet fragments lodged in his brain.
according to baby shoes, the cop was laughing before he got shot.
baby shoes?
guy who shot him. --Reliable witness.
his name is baby shoes. How bad can he be?
fragments are in the wrong part of the brain to cause euphoria.
so let's expand the search. Factor in the cough and the cloudy lungs.
why are we ignoring the elevated heart rate?--'Cause he's in shock.
what if the heart was already fast before he got shot?
you mean after the foot race?
he's giddy. Indicates a blockage of oxygen.
carbon monoxide gas would elevate the heart rate and cause coughing and impair neurological functions.
he got co poisoning outdoors?
Yeah.
all 'cause those bastards didn't ratify Kyoto.
or he got co poisoning indoors and moved outdoors before he'd inhaled enough to make him drop dead.
test his arterial blood gas. If his carboxy hemoglobin levels are higher than 15%, stick him in a hyperbaric chamber.
you go check the cop car for gas leaks or
if it was the cop car, his partner would be sick.
well, maybe she is she just doesn't have as good a sense of humor.
also check his personal cars, work, and home.
I'll check the precinct.
blood tests confirm you have low-level carbon monoxide poisoning.
we're putting you inside a high-pressure chamber to...
you don't really care, do you?
do you live near a gas supply?
uh, yeah, me.
after, like, a huge enchilada.
anything toxic you have at your home?
any paint solvents, anything unhygienic?
uh, no.
no, I keep a pretty clean home.
if you start having trouble breathing, you can press this button, and the chamber will decompress.
like this?
don't now. If you have trouble.
Ah, it's broken.
all right, well, if you have problems we'll push it for you.
muscle contracture.
how bad does it hurt?
not...not at all.
looks wild, though, huh?
your brain's not getting enough oxygen. You're losing motor function.
we should start this right away.
should I be scared?
no, you probably have a carbon monoxide leak in your place.
we have a guy there checking things out.
sounds okay.
how about the gas intake valve?
looks great.
it's down in the furnace room.
your system's fine.
if you had a carbon monoxide leak, half the force would be sick.
then why are you here?
I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
Yeah. I've, uh...I've got a disability.
these are speeding tickets.
a lot of emergencies.
he's feeling better now, but...you never know.
I'll see what we can do.
Where's your partner sit?
place is a cesspool, but I don't think I need to test for anything.
Nope, waste of time.
you know about the marijuana?
I've heard rumors since junior high.
the cop's acting high because he is high.
he's got--legionnaires' disease.
it's a good thing Joe got shot.
the whole precinct would have got wiped out. Anarchy on the streets.
takes 48 hours to test for legionnaire's.
and only two seconds to recognize if the symptoms fit while staring at the rancid, unchanged water of an ac unit.
marijuana explains the high carboxy, the cloudy lungs, and the happiness.
pot doesn't explain the fact that he's gotten worse since he was admitted.
why don't we agree to disagree?
actually, why don't we agree that you'll disagree with me while treating him for legionnaire's? It's not as pithy, but...
I feel a lot better. The meds are working.
heart rate's normal. Cohp levels are down. No fever.
take some deep breaths.
you seem disappointed.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
you got a problem with cops?
please don't talk.
in my experience, people who just don't like cops have a reason
I need you not to talk.
no rales.
these clouded areas of the upperobes...they're the infiltrates we found yesterday.
not there anymore?
they're clearing up. You had legionnaire's.
now you don't.
so you didn't, um...you didn't find anything at my place?
Nothing...medically relevant.
so there's, uh...there's nothing I need to worry about, then?
not this time.
whatcha doing?
I want to make sure he sees what's involved.
what we found was fairly advanced.
these cloudy areas here, and here.
these parts of your lungs simply weren't functioning.
they're okay now, right?
everything's okay now?
I'm fine.
you're blind.
I bumped into something. That doesn't mean I can't see.
I'm sure it's frightening, but you only think
what's dr. Cameron wearing?
dark blue pants, white shirt. Black shoes.
Ooh, almost.'Cept for the pants, shirt, and shoes. You're blind.
he really thinks he can see?
he can physically see. His brain just can't process it.
no chance this is a practical joke?
no way.
Anton's blindness indicates damage to both occipital lobes.
must be from the trauma.
bullet fragments just happen to hit the same spot in both lobes?
stroke could cause anton's blindness and euphoria.
office Krupke is clotting in his brain.
start heparin to thin the blood, find the clot, and yank it out.
clot would be at the top of the bilateral vertebral arteries.
great. Chase...stick your fingers in there, grope around till you find it.
Oh, wait...when you turn him into a vegetable, then there's gonna be frivolous lawsuits.
you know what would be better? Contrast MRI.
do we have one of those?
you can't do an MRI. If the bullet fragment's magnetic, they'll move and rip his brain apart.
well, let's flip a coin.
heads, MRI; tails, he dies.
the police issue Kevlar vests don't have the ceramic plate insert that would shatter a bullet, they would just catch it.
so the bullet shattered on its own.
meaning baby shoes was using 0.38 caliber hollow points.
which, unfortunately, are ferromagnetic.
it's just so cool that you know that.
we could do an angio to find the clotting.
waste of time. The skull creates too much artifact. We'll never get a decent view.
next best thing to an MRI.--And a waste of time.
angio might show--oh, god, it's a coup!
fine! Go do your angio.
when you're do wasting your time, meet me down in the morgue.
we're going to snake a catheter in your femoral artery and up into your brain so we can check for clots.
keep this on throughout the procedure.
unless the pot's already made you sterile.
I have a stressful job. You got no idea.
I grew up with cops like you.
one part bully, nine parts hypocrite.
what is wrong with you?
just having some fun.
that man is sick and scared.
the man's a crooked cop.
maybe you should take yourself off the case, Foreman.
don't have to like someone to be their doctor.
Hey, how you doing there, buddy?
just sit still and we'll have you back out there scaring the crap out of people in no time.
happy?
what did the angio tell us?
what are you looking for?
I called my mom. She didn't pick up.
what did the angio tell us?
that Foreman should be off this case.
he's a neurologist.
unless you think the patient's optic nerve is in his spleen...
he doesn't like cops.
Foreman, policemen are our friends.
if you and I ever get separated shopping
I was just busting the guy's chops.
See?--He was just busting the guy's chops.
foreman is essential to solving this case.
medically, what did the angio tell us?
appears to be some clotting, possibly around the circle of Willis.
based on the progression of symptoms, the clot is growing.
we need to cut into
saying there appears to be clotting is like saying there's a traffic jam ahead.
is it a 10-car pileup or just a really slow bus in the center lane?
and if it is a bus, is it a thrombotic bus of an embolic bus?
think I pushed that metaphor too far.
angio can't tell us that kind of information.
Oh, so you're saying it's just a waste of time.
it gave us some information without killing him.
you don't know that an MRI will kill him.
the bullets have a ferrous base!
little tiny pieces trapped in his head. They're not going anywhere.
maybe it's worth attempting surgery to remove the fragments.
surgeons say inoperable, or the patient's on blood thinners.
other than that, perfect planning.
you got a better plan?
much.
bullets identical to the one that baby shoes popped Joe with.
let's see how magnetic it is.
did anybody hear a
I shot him. He's dead.
the bullet split into four fragments, no exit wounds.
only used a half load of gunpowder.
we won't be exactly precise comparing the location on an X-ray to an MRI.
how unprofessional was Foreman?
as him yourself. He's right here.
worse than usual. Better than you.
he berated Joe for being a bad cop.
berated or humiliated?
I'm not sure. I didn't have my thesaurus with me.
one implies that he took pleasure in it.
I wanna know if it was repressed black anger or just giddiness.
you think I'm sick?
I think that an appropriate response to watching your boss shoot a corpse is not to grin foolishly.
but the fact that I've grown bored by your insanity is proof of nothing.
Dr. Foreman, Dr. Chase requests your assistance.
I can't even imagine the backwards logic you used to rationalize shooting a corpse.
well, if I'd shot a live person, there's a lot more paperwork.
then it won't be a problem for you to stand beside the casket at the wake and explain why a cancer patient has a bullet hole in his head?
the man donated his body to science.
Yes, it's a tragedy. If I hadn't shot him, his body could have spent the next year letting first-year med students use the carpool lane.
he's set.
do not turn that on, House.
you're mad because I put a bullet in his head.
at worst, all I'm doing now is taking it out.
my bad.
they have to, uh, shut down the magnet to fix it.
MRI is gonna be out of commission for at least two weeks.
well, it doesn't matter.
we obviously can't use it on this patient.
No...but there are other doctors in this hospital, and other patients.
that helps explain how they can afford all the fancy equipment.
I'm sure I'm pulling my weight.
is doing nothing an option?
I'm just saying. Maybe the clot will break up on its own.
the giddiness seems to have gone away.
the blindness hasn't.
echo his heart.
looking for what? The problem is obviously neurological.
the clots are in his brain. The source of the clots may not be.
do a complete transthoratic echocardiogram.
maybe we get lucky. Maybe the clots are coming from his heart.
heart's clean.
where else can we look?
we could ultrasound his legs, look for a dvt.
I need you to move over.
Joe? You okay?
tachycardia. Heart rate 150 and rising.
he's bleeding out.
house wanted to thin his blood. Sure did a good job.
bp's crashing. He's going into shock.
intracranial bleeding. We need to relieve the pressure.
we need a surgical team.
Foreman, get out!
boy, is he screwed!
we clot his blood, he dies. We thin it, he dies.
am I the only one who finds this funny?
Oh, man.
I'm not sick!
did you hear the one about the guy who bled into his brain and had to have a hole drilled in his skull to relieve the pressure? Hilarious!
someone laughs, they're dying? That's absurd.
but not funny.
if I'm not sick, all you're doing is locking me up with the source.
I'll get sick, prove you right.
if you're not sick, it's not contagious. You've got nothing to worry about.
if you are sick, the two of you are staying in there until we find that why.
so you might want to make friends with the pig.
good news is I can finally get my MRI.
no, you can't!
you blew up the machine!
not the portable one, chuckles.
chase and Cameron are bringing it to scan your non-bullet-riddled head.
Wh-where are you going?
to the office. Got work to do.
eat your meals.
take your temperature every half hour and any meds i command you to take.
so I'm just a regular patient now?
no.
you get your own thermometer.
check your blood.
anyone with an elevated sed rate gets to be Foreman's new roomie.
he should be a part of this.
he's a patient.
he's not irrational.--He's not objective.
he's got the most motivation to get this diagnosed.
right, you're not even friends with him. Why would you care?
there's an area of increased t2 attenuation in the cingulate cortex.
kind of...mushy.
cingulate cortex controls emotions.
this mushy spot explains the euphoria. Question is, what's causing the mush?
question you might want to ask a neurologist.
foreman is a selfish jerk, but he's a neurologist, and he's the only one who's been in that apartment.
this is why he shouldn't be here.
you wouldn't call him a jerk if he was here.
if you think he screwed up at that apartment, you'd keep it to yourself.
no, I--well, we'll never know.
but as long as he's not here, he's just like any other patient.
which means we can dump him all we want.
what's eating the selfish jerk's brain?
west Nile or eastern equine encephalitis--test Foreman's blood.
given that he's the only one who got it, person-to-person transmission is less likely than some sort of deadly toxin Foreman picked up at the guy's home.
who wants to go next?
you're ready to sacrifice yourself for a guy who doesn't consider you a friend.
he's just a patient, right? It's the job.
hey...you don't have to go anywhere.
Joe's apartment is right downstairs in the lab.
foreman brought back samples of everything.
what was that, "who wants to go next?"
some kind of...test?
don't worry. You made the right call.
foreman stumbled into whatever it is without knowing.
he's way smarter than you are.
damn, Chase!
you suck at this.
sorry, it's this damn suit.
I can do it myself. And I'll throw that out.
What'd the MRI show?
I can't be a part of the differential, and I can't even know what the differential is?
you'd tell any other patient what you found out.
MRI showed a lesion on your cingulate cortex.
what's the thinking?
toxins are in the lead.
Viral's a distant second.
do you think the lesion could be an abscess?
it's just a small, soft area, more mush than
was there inflammation in the lining of the ventricles?
there was an increased signal there, yeah.
what are you thinking?
staph infection.
toxins lead to neurodegeneration, which causes the lesion.
not without a fever.
the cop had a fever.
mine could be coming. I could have got it directly from him, or a dirty dish towel at his place.
give us omaya reservoirs. Deliver linezolid directly into our brains.
and we're cured.
samples tested negative for toluene, arsenic, and lead.
what about the blood?
negative for west Nile and eastern equine.
we have to go back to Joe's apartment
no one goes back to that place till we know what we're looking for.
get some of that cop tape. Stick it over the doors and the windows.
I'll take all the hazmat precautions. The chance of infection is next to nothing.
I was never that great at math.
but next to nothing is...higher than nothing, right?
it's not your fault he got sick.
it would be his fault if we did.
we should get a sample directly from Joe's brain.
we can't do a biopsy.
there's too much edema from the bleeding because you gave him heparin.
well, I don't think this is the time to be pointing fingers.
I didn't give Foreman any.
you want to give Foreman a brain biopsy?
come on, really, who doesn't?
this could be a simple staph infection causing neurodegeneration.
without a fever? Not a chance.
Joe had a fever. --He also had legionella.
the mush might be forming an abscess.
and since there was inflammation of the lining of the ventricles, it makes sense.
the staph releases toxins, causes neurodegeneration, causes a lesion.
this is a waste of time.
we should put an omaya reservoir in Foreman's brain and start administering anti
if I'm gonna be arguing with Foreman, I may as well do it directly.
Kernig's sign, negative.
Brudzinski's sign, single positive.
patient Joe Luria, distal and proximal arm contractures, duration four seconds.
staph infection most commonly presents on the skin.
most commonly?
you wanna treat me like any other patient, do it.
but the House I know never uses phrases like "most commonly.
you're not laughing anymore.
no.
think that's a good thing?
sorta doubt it.
staph would be in your heart, lungs, spleen, liver, or kidneys before it gets to your brain.
your organs are clear. It's not staph.
the infection could be limited to a brain abscess.
which I would have seen in your MRI.
sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain.
let me see the MRI.
there was no abscess on the image.
let me see it, then.
I liked you better when you were jolly.
MRI was taken over an hour ago.
that soft spot could now be an abscess.
if it was staph, you'd have a fever. Which you don't!
what idiot gave you that?
put the omaya reservoir in my skull and treat me for the staph.
triangle.
this one?
Uh...circle.
next.
Foreman, why aren't you answering? Is there a problem?
uh, s-square.
tell me your date of birth.
is that House?--Yeah. Next.
a square again. Why is he here?
because my neurologist is having surgery.
thought I was just another patient.
you didn't believe that crap, did you?
date of birth.
the omaya reservoir is inserted in the parietal lobe.
my spatial recognition is the issue, not my memory.
did you say omaya?
I could have sworn you said biopsy.
Hey, I'm just messing with your head.
mother's maiden name, please.
get out of my temporal lobe, House.
Hello?
are you awake?
they told me somebody was sick like me.
I'm up.
your voice...
aren't you my doctor?
not anymore.
you're the guy who doesn't like cops.
Yeah.
can you see?
you can't?
not a thing.
you've been blind a while.
the fact that you're aware of it now...
it could be a sign of improvement.
it hurts so much. Doesn't it?
I'm okay.
it's gonna hurt.
the morphine barely takes the edge off.
I'm gonna die, aren't I?
you die, I die. It's not gonna happen.
why not?
you're just too stubborn to die?
they took a piece of my brain.
whatever's wrong with us...they'll find.
do you believe in prayer?
not really.
neither do I.
my dad always prays.
so does mine.
do you wanna try it?
try prayin'?
okay.
how is he?
still dying.
well, you've almost mastered another skill, though. That's good.
Foreman's biopsy results.
non-specific signs of inflammation.
that's it?
we also swabbed for staph. Negative. He's not even a carrier.
well, at least Foreman was wrong too.
Yeah, there's that.
can I go to Joe's apartment now?
no.
go back to the lab.
start retesting all the samples that Foreman collected.
for what?
everything.
bacteria, toxins, fungus. Anything that likes to feast on brain.
that's thousands of
better hurry.
cameron, suit up. You're gonna monitor foreman.
he's on to hand contractures. He'll be in anton's blindness soon.
run hourly checks, because when he does go blind, he won't be able to tell us.
we'll use the data to construct a timeline so we can see how far behind Joe he is.
why are you still here?
it's just another case, huh?
gee, I bet you can even have unprotected sex with your cancer patients without catching a damn thing.
boy, I wish I had your job.
biopsy showed nothing.
how can there be nothing? You cut out a piece of my brain.
it's nothing personal. We just didn't find anything.
can you up his morphine for god's sake?
he's already maxed out, 20 milligrams per hour.
what about toxins?
everything was negative.
there was a cupboard above the stove. Did you see it?
I didn't check all the food, but could be listeriosis.
we didn't go back. Follow right.
who did?
house said we shouldn't go. Too dangerous.
the answer's gotta be in that apartment. Not going is too dangerous!
I'm sorry.
you're thankful.
if House would have pointed at you instead of me, you'd be the one in here.
look straight forward, tell me when you can see
it's your job to go back! You're a doctor! You go where the disease is!
say when you can see the light.
I'm dying, and you're sitting here measuring how fast I go?
tell me when you can see the light!
my vision's fine!
your left-side periphery is reduced.
it's fine, I'll prove it.
Ow! Son of a bitch!
now we're both exposed.
you got two choices.
you can go tell House what just happened and get your own cot board in here, or you can go back to that apartment...
you save me, the cop, and yourself.
it's not sspe. I checked your past vaccinations against Joe's. No batch matches.
blood show antibodies for coxsackievirus?
guys, could you please shut him up?
he's over his limit on morphine.
Where's Cameron?
she said she has some stuff to do. Said she'd be back soon.
what are you doing?
stop! I can't take it!
imagine being constantly reminded of the...pain you're about to be in.
I can't take it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it, stop it.
mainline morphine into his carotid could stop his heart!
so could pain-induced stress cardiomyopathy.
either the morphine kills him or the pain does. --You're condoning this?!
I'm certainly not going in there to stop him.
that'll make you feel better.
Joe has a new symptom. Hyperalgesia.
the infection's spreading to the pain center of the brain.
make it stop! Make it stop!
his brain's telling him that his whole body's in pain, and because of the location, the painkillers do nothing.
suit up. Put the guy in a coma before the pain kills him.
what if he used cedarwood to hide the pot smell?
Aureobasidium fungus could grow there.
did you find any cedarwood anywhere?
no, but maybe--maybe what?
maybe somebody could go back, take a second look?
and why aren't you pissed off that Cameron's playing hooky while your life hangs in the balance?
why doesn't anyone listen to me anymore?
I decided you were wrong.
God, you're weak.
guy steals your article...
tells you you're not his friend...
and you still want to risk your life for him.
foreman broke my skin with a tainted needle.
Yeah.
God, you're weak. Guy tried to kill you.
first thing on my list of things to do would be to stab him back. Shoot him.
I've got a gun in my desk.
last thing on my list would be to lie to my boss about it and then give the bastard everything he wanted.
I'm not here for Foreman. I'm here to save myself.
even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim.
that's why you're wearing the suit.
you wanted to be here.
he just gave you the excuse.
what does that guy have to do to make you hate him?
give me the bag.
mildewed dish towel.--To retest for staph.
what is that, mouse droppings?
hamster droppings. Could carry toxocara. Explain the blindness.
now, that I recognize as oven crud.
could be meat with trichinella. Would explain the high fever.
what's with rye bread?
mold could be responsible for ergot poisoning, which would explain the contractures.
there are three loaves.--So?
you're going back in there.
guy who lives on take-out pizza does not buy three loaves of rye.
that's looking too far into the future.
unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.
you on the roof yet?
Yeah, I'm here. I don't see any birds.
whistle or something.
do that come hither thing.
they came that fast because it's their behavior pattern.
Joe's been feeding them.
now look down. You see a river of pigeon turd?
Uh...no. There's barely any.
it's not weird, it's cheap.
Joe's a guy who looks for the easy way.
probably been stealing cable from his neighbors.
why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings?
you see a shovel or a dustpan?
Mmm, found a scraper. Looks used.
sitting on a bucket.
bucket full of pigeon crap. Perfect home for cryptococcus neoformans.
Yep.
fungus enters the brain through the sphenoidal sinus, where it dances its triple threat of happiness, blindness, and intractable pain.
let's hope this experience teaches our cop a lesson.
don't cut corners when you're growing your pot. See you back home.
I was there.
I should have found it.
Yeah, you could have saved us a lot of time.
get me a flush of ampho b and flucytosine.
I'll start us both.
I was waiting for lab confirmation. Haven't heard from House yet.
look at his eeg.
theta band's been increasing steadily since--since we put him under.
guy's unconscious, but still in pain.
theta bands could indicate at least half a dozen different things.
one of which is pain.
the fact that he's no longer screaming makes us feel better, not necessarily him.
chase! How's Cameron?
she's not giddy.
fever's down. White count's improving.
has she said anything to you?
you mean like, "I completely understand why Foreman did what he did, and I hold no grudge?"
what I did...did save my life.
get in here and help! Forget the suit!
he's tachycardic! Wide-complex looks like v-tach!
it's not cryptococcus!
What?--House was wrong. The samples were negative.
so what is it?
we don't know!--Give him in the amio.
do we have any more leads?
that was our lead! Foreman!
so the treatment isn't doing anything.
Foreman! He's in v-fib!
no good. Hit him again.
come on, man. Come on, Joe.
hit him again!
give him an amp of epi!
nothing!
he's has multiple-system failure.
come on, Joe.
Foreman! Time of death.
no.
time of death.
he's got a temperature of 103.
and why do we care?
because we're human beings. It's what we do.
he said he was at a luncheon memeeting.
you took his history?
guy looks like Harpo. You should see him.
you asked him what book he's currently reading.
it's hilarious to watch him try and talk.
I asked him anything I could think of.
favorite color:
favorite dessert topping?
trust me, you never know what fact may prove the key to saving your life.
whipped cweam.
I asked him if he was sure.
where are you going?
you're an ass.
I know.
where are you going?
this is either a toxin, an infection, or an allergic reaction.
I assume you gave him epi, so that rules out allergies.
put him on antibiotics in case it's an infection.
and if it's a toxin, we'll keep him here overnight, let the swelling go down, send him home.
I'm going to the movies.
which one of you is House?
the skinny brunette.
no, that's Dr. Cameron.
I'm skinny. How do you know her name?
I was a patient of yours.
Oh, well, if you want to leave the chocolates downstairs
stay!
stay away from him.
shocking, isn't it?
who'd want to hurt you?
you're pathetic.
judging by the growth,
I'd say I've been unconscious for two days.
have you been sitting there the whole time?
no.
judging by the oily buildup in your hair,
I'd say you're lying.
I was scared.
pardon me for caring.
did I lose any organs?
the bullet to your abdomen pierced your stomach, nicked the bowel, lodged in the posterior rib.
well, I always say, if you're gonna get shot, do it in a hospital.
the one in your neck.
I don't remember that one.
went right through, severed your jugular.
the shooter turns out to be a guy
don't care.
you don't care why a guy walked into a hospital and shot a doctor?
shot you?
I assume his reasoning was faulty.
so what was it?
infection?
the surgery went fine.
you've had no post-op.
not me. Patient.
you just got shot, house. You should rest.
I got shot. Diagnostically boring.
big fat tongue, on the other hand... endlessly entertaining.
we biopsied his tongue.
and it was negative.
and the blood tests were negative.
I didn't say we did blood tests.
you don't biopsy a tongue unless you have to biopsy a tongue.
and you don't have to biopsy a tongue unless you've already come up with nothing on a routine battery of tests which don't involve torturing your patient.
any new symptoms?
other than the increased intracranial pressure?
any guesses on how I figured that one out?
you knew the next step would be a lumbar puncture.
a lumbar puncture would almost certainly give us a definitive answer.
since we don't have a definitive answer, we must not have done an lp, and the most common reason to not do an lp is increased intracranial pressure.
he was shot by security trying to.
house, what are you...
I'm talking to Cuddy.
lie down.
you've got to be in pain.
not today.
today I'm on morphine.
you're going to rip your stitches out.
check Harpo's trash.
forget about the patient.
come on.
you're curious.
trash?
you don't know what I'm talking about but you know it's good.
you can't just be walking around.
well, then stop me.
you've lost blood-- physically stop me.
you could damage-- you can't.
because that would involve physically touching me, and then things would't so sexually charged.
I'm twice your size.
get your hands off me.
everything that lives, eats.
everything that eats, poops.
that's why every organ has a sanitation department.
the lymph system.
whatever's doing the damage is dumping its waste in there.
that's what you meant by trash.
biopsy the lymph node under the jaw.
I'm sorry, I know it's crazy, but there's no other place.
it's the ICU.
it stands for intensive care.
he needs intensive care, so do you.
he needs to be shot again.
he is handcuffed to his bed.
he is sedated.
he's not going to hurt you.
if your security was any good,
I wouldn't have been shot in the first place.
he is where he's supposed to be.
where you're supposed to be-- who did my surgery?
gillick, why?
you going to send him a fruit basket?
he screwed up.
it's annoying enough dealing with your vicodin habit.
quit upping your morphine.
I'm not.
I'm reducing it.
and you're not in pain?
I'm feeling better.
Gillick is very good.
your recovery time.
my stomach kills me, my neck is throbbing, but my leg feels better.
that's amazing.
it's unbelievable.
since getting shot is not an FDA approved treatment for anything, it means something must have gone wrong in the surgery.
Yes, terribly...tragically wrong.
enjoy the mistake.
he must have nicked something in my peripheral nervous system.
if it's alleviating pain, who knows what else it's doing?
get back to the ICU before you rip out your stitches, and I have to chain you to your bed.
why did you try to kill me?
I didn't.
then the gun thing might have been a mistake.
if I'd have killed you, it would have been over.
I needed you to live.
because I want to see you suffer.
get the needle out of there.
he can't breathe.
the test was negative.
are you sure you want to be doing this?
I'm fine.
I think Cameron, you got my records?
they don't like to release patient's operative notes.
and yet you're holding them.
and whispering.
he's sleeping.
Yeah.
killer needs his rest.
otherwise, he's grumpy all day.
Hey! Wake up.
watch me save a life almost for sure it's some sort of infection.
we've got him on broad spectrum antibiotics, but it's not even slowing the thing down.
unless we figure out what type of infection, we can't treat, and we can't figure out what type because we can't do an lp.
do an lp.
see what I did there?
couldn't have done that if you'd killed me.
we would have done an lp two days ago if we could have.
but that much pressure, - something's bound to go - we would have done an lp two days ago if the risks hadn't so obviously outweighed the benefits.
we just cut a hole in his throat.
the equation has changed.
couldn't have put it better myself.
pressure...
120 millimeters h2o, with small visible excursions related to respiration and pulse.
well within normal, that's good.
no, that's weird.
you want to hear a story?
I have a rule.
people who shoot me forfeit the right.
my wife was sick.
none of the doctors could figure out why.
Oh, I know this story.
she died.
so you selected one of her doctors to kill, because that would make everything right again.
she lived.
you cured her.
I'm truly sorry I did that.
in the course of investigating her illness, you convinced me that everything was relevant.
you needed the truth.
I confessed to you that I'd had an affair.
but it turns out that it had nothing to do with why she was sick.
genetic predisposition to brain aneurysms.
you told her that.
you also told her about my affair.
and you caught crap, she left you, and now I've got to pay because you couldn't keep your little killer in your pants.
she killed herself.
what sort of hospital has glass walls?
that's my husband.
Really?
you thought I just liked watching people get needles poked in the back?
Nope.
I figured a coworker or a sister.
not wife.
Why?
don't worry. It's not insulting.
at least not to you.
you're satisfied by that answer?
you're Dr. House, aren't you?
you're not going to shoot me, are you?
you treated a friend of mine.
she told me you only talk to people if you have to.
and then you insult them while showing off how insightful you are.
sevens marry sevens.
nines marry nines.
fours marry fours.
maybe there's some wiggle room if there's enough money, or somebody got pregnant.
but you've got at least three points on your husband, and your frock says you didn't do it for the money.
and your breasts say that you haven't had any kids.
so you figure my marriage is a mathematical error?
numbers don't lie.
we're having trouble finding out what infection your husband has.
the most likely culprit is an std.
you want to know if I've had an affair with someone closer to my integer.
and I have to tell you the truth, or my husband will die.
is your friend single?
no.
and I've always been faithful.
Wow.
I would've bet money something would go wrong.
let's rotate him back.
he's bleeding into his ocular orbit.
lp wouldn't do this.
lots of pressure behind.
gotta relieve it.
what's going on? What-- what are they doing?
I should go.
I seem to have torn my stitches.
you collapsed in the hall.
tore your stitches.
I remember. I was there.
how's your gut? It's hurting?
you shoot the guy who sold her the gun?
she locked herself in the garage, and she started the car.
you shoot the guy who sold her the garage door opener?
you're an ass.
that is a bold position to take, given that I shot you.
the shooting just makes you an idiot.
you're an ass because you're trying to wrap it in the flag, like you did a good thing.
you're an ass and a hypocrite.
you don't believe in rules.
you do whatever you think is right.
that's all I did.
you were my role model.
watch out. You're getting crumbs on the flag.
I didn't commit to honor her.
I didn't commit to never lie to her.
well, if you'd kept your mouth shut, she'd be alive, and you wouldn't be shot.
if you'd kept your pistols in your pants.
it's my fault she's dead.
I know it.
but why can't you admit that it's maybe just a little bit yours. too?
that maybe it's not just medical mistakes that screw things up.
here's how life works.
you either get to ask for an apology, or you get to shoot people.
not both.
infections don't make your eyes pop out.
we should get back.
you're supposed to be chained to your bed.
I'm not done eating.
there's got to be some sort of bleeding disorder.
this is really stupid.
look, if my stitches pop out again,
I got three doctors to save me.
could be some sort of weakness in the lining of the ocular veins.
okay, I'll be you guys.
no way, mate.
too much blood to just be a vein.
no way, hizzie.
if it was an artery, he'd still be bleeding.
actually, he'd be dead.
he could have had a granuloma in his sinuses that bled, which could have been caused by Wegener's.
I think the surgeon would have noticed a giant growth while they were sticking the eyeball back in.
tongue and eyes are sick.
what about the nose?
it's right in between. Why isn't it sick?
so it's not spreading. It's got a common source.
which can only be what?
the brain, except the CT was clean.
check the brain's trash, see what it's hiding.
the brain doesn't have a lymph system.
I know.
all its garbage just blows off, gets caught in the snow fence by the side of the road.
you're referring to the blood-brain barrier.
what else?
biopsy the barrier.
wouldn't it be safer to make a few educated guesses first?
try some relatively safe treatments?
biopsy the barrier.
but first, start him on mebendazole in case it's a worm.
and levofloxacin in case it's an infection that slipped by the first antibiotic.
and azithromycin for stds.
I really don't think the wife is the kind to be messing around.
if I was married to her, I certainly wouldn't.
the patient isn't married. He's a widower.
really, it's more helpful if you do the prescribed rehab yourself.
my body is fine.
my mind, on the other hand...
maybe she was a girlfriend.
maybe she was just trying to jerk you around.
I spoke to every one of the nurses on that floor.
the patient had only had six visitors.
two females, no babes.
his mother and his aunt.
so they missed someone.
they're not security.
my posse never saw her or me talking on the other side of the glass.
they were a little busy trying to save the guy's life.
there's on one possible conclusion.
it was a hallucination.
what does that look like to you?
anesthesia?
no.
it's got to be six and a smudge.
let's say you're right.
it wouldn't be that uncommon after trauma.
after that much blood loss?
if my perceptions are compromised, then my judgment is compromised.
what if his wife told me that the patient just got bit by a rabid Vietnamese leper?
so pull yourself off the case.
and the next case?
you take two weeks.
you recover.
what if I don't?
what if it wasn't the shooting?
the guy who sees connections between everything sees no connection between being shot and minor brain disruptions?
what if it was the surgery?
what if it was the fact that you tore out your stitches and lost two pints of blood?
why did Gillick give me ketamine during my surgery?
working.
we need to talk.
get back to the ICU. Who un-cuffed you?
why would a surgeon administer Ketamine?
who showed you your surgical file?
how do you know it's mine?
because your patient hasn't had surgery, and you don't care about anybody else.
my anesthesia was almost nonexistent, and yet I wasn't awake.
for some reason, somebody decided to put me in a dissociative coma instead of just putting me out.
there are plenty of reasons to use.
fine.
I'll go beat the truth out of my surgeon.
gillick, right?
it worked.
there's a clinic in Germany.
they've been treating chronic pain by inducing comas, and letting the mind basically reboot itself.
there's about a 50% chance your pain will come back.
which of course means there is a 50% chance that it won't.
you had no right.
to heal you?
you messed with my brain.
why are you so upset?
are you experiencing any neurological symptoms?
dizziness, tremors, hallucinations?
no.
it's a point of principle.
test was negative.
no trash against the fence.
is your leg really better?
don't worry, I'm sure something else is wrong.
we did find blood.
on which side?
the wrong side.
first thing that makes sense.
the wrong side's the wrong side.
it can't make sense.
it'd mess with his brain.
wouldn't cause fever.
he's been sleeping a lot lately.
you worried?
I marked a change of meds on his chart.
foreign object.
body wants to get rid of it.
it causes the fever.
blood's a foreign object?
in the brain lining, it is.
blood dyscrasia means cancer.
find it.
all the tests-- have been negative.
what do you do if your trash cans are full?
you use your neighbors' trash cans.
except it's still light outside.
your neighbor will see you.
so you go out the back way, into an alley, and drop off your trash by their garage.
we'll check the lymphatic system in the chest.
you got that from trash cans in the alley?
the saliva glands from the tongue are connected to the lymphatic system in the lungs.
it's the next lymphatic system over.
Yeah.
go get lung lymph.
how did he know that?
I uldn't have hired him if he wasn't smart.
right.
because you have nothing but respect for him.
maybe he knew the answer because the question wasn't nearly as tricky as you thought.
maybe he's not getting smarter.
you're getting dumber.
you pretend to buck the system.
pretend to be a rebel.
you claim to hate rules.
but all you do is substitute your own rules for society's.
and it's a nice, simple rule.
tell the blunt, honest truth in the starkest, darkest way.
and what will be will be.
what will be should be.
and everyone else is a coward.
but you're wrong.
it's not cowardly to not call someone an idiot.
people aren't tactful or polite just because it's nice.
they do it because they've got an ounce of humility.
because they know that they will make mistakes, and they know that their actions have consequences.
and they know that those consequences are their fault.
why do you want so bad not to be human, House?
Oh, he's awake.
house, we need to talk to you.
how the hell did you know I was awake?
your nostrils flare when you sleep.
no, they do not.
fine, I'm lying.
test was negative.
you knew?
force of habit.
showed no cancer.
no reason why he's got a fever of 103, and no reason why his tongue won't fit in his mouth.
he's post-op. Chase is getting him up and around.
it's important that you're up asap after surgery.
you think you can urinate?
it's getting bigger!
what, you're...
getting aroused?
No! Not that part.
Oh, god, it hurts.
it's not stopping.
surgeons found no evidence of a burst artery.
the blood had to come from somewhere.
you took a shower in it.
trauma?
you think someone snuck in here just to kick him in the jewels?
and poke out his eye, and swell up his tongue?
keep riding.
I got a bet with my physio that I can do 100 klicks by friday.
what about blood from the kidneys?
kidneys drain into the bladder, which drains into the ureter.
there's no way it would mess with the scrotum.
Yeah.
basic human anatomy.
therefore, I think it's safe to assume that the problem lies elsewhere.
but given that this case doesn't make any kind of sense whatsoever, maybe we should even question the basics.
maybe he's not human.
an anatomical defect would seem more likely, but let's not rule that one out.
even more likely, he is human, his anatomy is where it's supposed to be, but he has testicular cancer.
we tested for cancer.
we tested the lymph system in his chest.
surgeons found no growth.
surgeons were just trying to put everything back where it was.
they weren't doing an inventory.
may have been lucky.
if you don't catch testicular cancer early, it kills.
probably eroded some vessel.
Yeah, I know.
the question is why I didn't think of it.
eyes popping out is a rather odd presentation.
sack blowing up, on the other hand...
if you could think of everything yourself, you wouldn't need a team to annoy.
I screwed up some basic anatomy.
and I missed connecting a testicular explosion with a testicular problem.
you think there's any way I would have done that before Cuddy messed with my brain?
she was trying to help you, and it worked.
Yeah, I can run like the wind, but I can't think.
and seeing as how I'm too old to become a professional athlete, it looks to me as if she screwed me over big time.
you don't want a healthy leg.
Oh, here we go.
if you've got a good life, if you're healthy, you've got no reason to bitch. No reason to hate life.
here's the flaw in your argument.
if I enjoy hating life, I don't hate life. I enjoy it.
I didn't say it was rational.
hiv testing is 99% accurate, which means there are some people who test positive who live with their own impending doom for months, or years, before finding out everything's okay.
weirdly, most of them don't react with happiness. Or even anger.
they get depressed.
not because they wanted to die, but because they've defined themselves by their disease.
suddenly, what made them them isn't real.
I don't define myself by my leg.
no, you have taken it one step further.
the only way you could come to terms with your disability was to somehow make it mean nothing.
so you had to redefine everything.
you have dismissed anything physical.
anything not coldly, calculatingly intellectual.
why are you protecting her?
because she's done nothing wrong.
you're completely comfortable with what she did to me?
Yeah, I am. Yeah.
you agonize over moral choices.
you're not completely comfortable with anything until you've taken days to get your head around every possible side.
I've known what she did for six hours.
how come you're acting like you've known for days?
what do I have?
you're not sick.
what do I have?
you need to calm down.
I have my brain! And that's it!
we were trying to help you.
Yeah, nobody tries to screw up! They just do.
you were out of control. You were shooting morphine.
I can make people better!
and you two decide to trade that for jogging shoots.
if you're suffering from side effects, then we can look at that.
you value the physical so much.
let me put this in terms you can understand.
you're unbelievable.
even when you're out of your mind with anger and fear, you still couch it in logical terms.
are you hallucinating?
Yeah, I'm hallucinating!
no, I mean right now.
are you hallucinating?
how did you know I was...
you were yelling at me.
you were calling me Wilson.
no.
you're losing it, House.
I never call Wilson by his name.
Oh, yeah, right.
the hallucinator is going to tell the hallucinatee what happened.
you're not the hallucinatee. Wilson was the hallucinatee.
you think maybe you're focusing on the wrong thing here?
Cuddy's office was the hallucinatee.
the bathroom was the hallucinatee.
bathroom. It figures.
what figures?
you wet your bed.
damn it.
test was negative.
no.
afp and beta hcg say no testicular cancer.
so, let's recap. We've just ruled out everything.
which doesn't make sense.
so the answer has to be something that doesn't make sense.
do a cystoscopy. Make sure he's human.
test was negative.
for him being human?
everything was right where it's supposed to be.
all the tubes go where they're supposed to go.
most likely scenario is some kind of bacterial prostatitis.
find out if his father hunche his father have trouble peeing?
his father have sex with his own mother?
if the answers to any of these questions is yes, assume you're right.
if the answers are no, assume you're right, but biopsy some prostate lymphs just to be sure.
but...
then we'd have to cut through his stomach.
and since he's clearly got a bleeding problem, this kind of surgery might
he doesn't clearly have anything.
how did I get here?
what are you talking about?
I was in the ICU.
and then I was coming down these stairs with you guys.
what happened in between?
I don't remember how I got here.
I'm taking myself off my case.
your patient's in critical care. He's had a fever unabated for two.
I'm losing my mind.
I'm having blackouts.
you said you weren't having any.
I lied.
if you are doing this to scare me, you made your point.
next time you get shot, I promise to only treat the bullet wounds.
I'm off the case.
why did you jump up when I came in?
I thought you were going to attack me again.
again?
Yeah, you were in my face.
you were-- no, I wasn't.
you came in here with Wilson and
that was a hallucination.
no, you.
which means this is a hallucination.
how can I tell what's real and what's not?
everything looks the same.
sounds the same.
tastes the same.
seems like I'd be the last person you'd want to ask.
why not?
you're obviously not here.
I'm obviously not here.
which means this is a creation of my mind, which means I'm really just asking myself.
well, if you're talking to yourself, that's a lot of unnecessary explanation.
Hey, I'm trying to work this out.
that requires give and take, even in my own mind.
what was the question?
how can I tell what's real?
does it matter?
that doesn't sound like something I'd ask.
all right.
your concern is at if you act in the real world based on information that's not real, the results are impossible to foresee.
with you so far.
but information is incapable of harm in and of itself.
ideas are neither good nor bad, but merely as useful as what we do with them.
only actions can cause harm.
that sounds like me.
so you do nothing.
you refrain from taking any actions.
continue to throw out your ideas as you always would, but if they're based on faulty assumptions, your team will point that out.
they won't do anything that could hurt him.
so I trust my team.
test was negative.
no blood in the prostate.
no structural abnormalities.
if something doesn't make sense, what does that mean?
it's not rhetorical.
I need your input on everything I ask, no matter how obvious it might seem.
it means you're wrong.
it means one of your assumptions is wrong.
because if something doesn't make sense, it can't be real.
so, what are our assumptions?
we don't have any. We're just guessing on testing.
we assume the tests are right.
we've already redone them twice. Let's go more basic.
what's more basic than the test results?
the tests themselves.
what does a biopsy consist of?
you take a sample.
define sample.
it's a small representative piece of whatever you think is the problem.
you go down to the shore, you fill a cup of water.
it's got no fish in it.
does that mean no fish in the ocean?
we can do another biopsy.
we could fill another cup of water. We gotta dive in.
we gotta see what's actually in there.
we can't operate. He's got a bleeding problem.
we assume he's got a bleeding problem.
Yeah, because he bled from where he wasn't supposed to bleed, causing parts of his body to blow up.
assuming that crazy assumption is correct, if we operate on him, we'll kill him.
what if we could find a way to do this surgery without giving him more than a paper cut?
you want to let a robot operate on me?
the technology is amazing.
it magnifies everything ten times. It's ten times the accuracy.
no way. I want a person.
a person will be controlling
people suck.
people have turned you from a guy with a swollen tongue into a guy with one eye, one ball, and a stapled-on face.
if you want someone to hold you while you cry yourself to sleep at night, choose warm and soft.
if you want someone to write you a poem, pick the sensitive loner.
but if all you care about is that something's done right, pick the guy with the metal head.
no way.
no way, no way.
you gotta see this thing in action before you say no way. Come on.
house. What are you doing?
nothing.
I'm not doing anything.
just throwing out ideas.
I think you should put him in a wheelchair, take him down to the O. R.
but I may be out of my mind.
relax, Cameron.
I'm not going to cut you.
I just want to show what this puppy can do.
it can make one-millimeter incisions.
you know how small that is?
it's small even in metric.
if I do something that doesn't make sense, even to you, stop me.
delicate, no?
does that hurt?
seen enough?
no.
that wasn't a question.
you either do this, or you die.
you've wasted your life.
Yeah.
if only I'd spent more time dedicating myself to finding someone worthy to shoot.
if I had killed you, would it have mattered?
not to me.
have you got a pen?
you don't care if you live or die?
I care because I live.
I can't care if I'm dead.
I don't want to hear semantics.
you anti-semantic bastard.
would anybody care that the world lost that wit?
working here.
that's all right. You don't have to say anything.
just let me soak into your subconscious.
you think that the only truth that matters is the truth that can be measured.
good intentions don't count.
what's in your heart doesn't count.
caring doesn't count.
but a man's life can be measured by how many tears are shed when he dies.
just because you can't measure them, just because you don't want to measure them, doesn't mean it's not real.
that does not make sense.
and even if I'm wrong, you're still miserable.
did you really think that your life's purpose was to sacrifice yourself and get nothing in return?
no.
you believe there's no purpose to anything.
even the lives you save, you dismiss.
you turn the one decent thing in your life, and you taint it, strip it of all meaning.
you're miserable for nothing.
I don't know why you'd want to live.
I'm sorry.
I know what's wrong.
house, get out of here. You're not sterile.
he'll be fine.
great.
what's he got?
how come you guys have never tried to yank me off this case?
I'm having hallucinations.
blackouts.
but you're always insane, and you're always right.
I'm almost always eventually right.
you have no way of knowing when "eventually" is.
every time I've had an epiphany on this one, you guys were right on board.
no challenges, no need to explain.
no offense, but either you guys are getting smarter, or I'm getting dumber.
I know the test results even before you enter the room.
we have identical knowledge.
how is that possible?
you're wrong.
if something doesn't make sense, one of your assumptions has to be wrong.
because if something doesn't make sense, it can't be real.
but what if the faulty assumption is that it's real?
house, you're losing it.
I've lost it.
why did you stop me?
because I think you're going to kill him.
no, you don't think that.
you know it.
because you're in my head.
as long as the delusion makes sense, my mind lets it go on.
I have to make it not make sense. I have to...
push it past the point where it can trick my mind.
Hey, hey.
if this is a nightmare, you're gonna wake up.
if it's real, you're killing a man.
it's also possible that I may already be dead.
but I don't believe in the after life.
house, go back to your room.
if this is a hallucination, it's a good one.
you're pain free, you can walk
it's not real. Therefore, it's meaningless.
I want meaning.
Oh, god.
goodbye.
he was shot. Twice.
once in the abdomen, once in the neck.
Hello.It's going to be okay.
you're gonna be okay.
you don't know nothing.
tell cuddy...
I want ketamine.
mark, would you please ask your father if he wants a burger?
I know, you're defending the free world. Please ask your dad if he wants a burger.
dad.
dad.
mom wants to know if you want a burger.
mom, I don't know what he wants.
you want a burger?
the guy drove his wheelchair into a pool. House would love that.
he'll be bored. It's a great visual, but it's diagnostically boring.
what about post-hair-transplant aphasia guy?
infection throwing clots. House'll shoot it down and call you an idiot.
Oh, well, I wouldn't want that.
what about yoga girl?
it has a good hook.
should we lead with it?
his first day back he might want to flex his sarcasm muscle.
maybe we open with one of the weaker pitches.
you ran here?
it's just eight miles.
why did you
why does a dog lick its workplace-acceptable euphemism for testicles?
because he can.
what do you got for me, boss?
I thought you said you needed eight weeks of rehab. You should've been back here
if I'd come back sooner, then I'd only be able to run six miles. I never would've made it in.
what do you got for me?
you're completely pain-free?
the ketamine treatment can wear off.
it's been two months. It's not wearing off.
what do you got for me?
it can takeas long as-- -why are we having this discussion?
NNA hear me ank you again? Thank you, dr. Cuddy
not just for removing the bullet, but thank you for putting me in a ketamine-induced coma and changing my life.
happy? I am.
middle-aged man had a hair transplant about two months ago
infection throwing clots. You're an idiot.
except you're not an idiot.
and she's holding a file for a 26-year-old female.
what do you really got for me?
girl was doing an inverted yoga pose. Neck snapped. Paralyzed from the neck down.
except the x-rays show no evidence of spinal injury.
and she's cute.
Oh, well played, sir.
what about stephen hawking trying to do the 500 butterfly?
forget it. Brain cancer, brain surgery.
there's nothing left diagnose. I would take the other one.
I'll take 'em both.
you don't think he had brain cancer?
course he had brain cancer. Even oncologists don't screw up for eight years.
so if there's nodiagnostic issue, why are you taking the case?
treatment can be interesting.
not to you. -I've changed.
no, you haven't. -No, I haven't.
so why are you taking the case?
guy tried to kill himself.
the guy had cancer. He's a lump.
he hasn't been able to touch his wife, speak to his kids.
he's been in that chair for eight years.
his muscles have atrophied. Maybe I can help him with the pain.
isn't that enough of a reason to want to help?
not for you.
I've changed.-No, you haven't.
then why am I taking this case?
let's start with the cute paraplegic.
welcome back.
you look
healthy.
quad with no broken neck. Struck me as odd.
uh, you could take a whole two minutes to ease into being back.
wouldn't taken a whole month to ease back.
but eight weeks is the maximum rehab time for a gunshot wound to the stomach and neck.
so go.
we heard they never found the guy. There's no new leads?
what, you think he might've shot this patient, too? That would explain her symptoms.
could be M. S.
see? It's not so difficult.
it's not M. S.
she had no symptoms before she climbed onto her head.
unless she's been upside-down for the last ten years, M. S. ain't it.
could be transverse myelitis, swelling in the disks choking off nerve function.
MRI was negative for that.
when did this turn into"what did you do over your summer vacation?
it's a little weird to discuss the case while you're staring at your blood on the floor.
I asked cuddy to replace the carpet.
I like the carpet.
what did you do over the summer?
I-- -redo the tests.
let's see if the source of the problem is in the limbs or the spine. Do an emg.
got a whole other quad to cover.
this guy's still got fluid in his lungs.
you don't think that's from the pool he drank?
get him an o-2 mask. His leg muscles have atrophied.
tendons have shortened from disuse, causing intense pain.
tendon surgery will make him more comfortable.
comfortable?
scoot.
thanks for being here.
not a problem.
my dad wouldn't kill himself.
you haven't spoken to him in over six years.
I know my dad.
mark, the doctor'sjust trying to
he wouldn't kill himself.
fine. I'm wrong.
you obviously havea better understanding of this man who droo in front of your TV set 24 hours a day.
Dr. House.
he must have been confused.
all right? It must have been an accident.
hope it was a suicide attempt.
if he was trying to kill himself, then he knows how miserable his life is.
it means there's still something there to kill.
it means your dad's still there.
sorry. Need you.
thank you.
we were doing the emg, but we never got past the insertion of the conduction pin.
did she just say"thank you"?
I loaned her some money. What went wrong?
nothing went wrong.
if nothing went wrong, then something went right.
you're not gonna tell me why she thanked you?
you're not gonna tell me what went right?
you did something for which she is grateful, and you're...
embarrassed?
for you.
she saw you coming up, thought you were a 14-year-old boy. I set her straight.
I am not telling you what went wrong. Or right.
until you tell me why she said thank you.
Oh, you've got me.
you know I need to know. I am so gonna fold.
except you're forgetting there's one thing I can do now.
it's either that or a reflex response or
what happened?
okay.
this is dr. House.
house, this is caren. -Pleasure's all mine. What happened?
when we inserted the conduction pin, she flinched.
she flinched! Did you hear?
does that mean I'm getting better?
how big is a flinch?
bigger than a twitch? Smaller than a spasm?
you smoke?
socially. Not a lot.
you do yoga and you smoke?
I know. It's hypocritical.
not at all. The world sees your legs.
no one's checking out your lungs.
how would smoking-- -it wouldn't.
I just needed a lighter.
Oh, my god!
the case was looking so promising.
Hey, I'm not faking.
you moved. Therefore, you can move.
get this lunatic out of here before she bores again.
I'm not faking!
I heard you were watching surgery with a patient's family.
talking to a patient's family.
it's because of your hallucination, isn't it? After you were shot.
you chose life. You decided you wanted meaning.
so you took a case with no mystery.
something any doctor could do.
a case with no upside except the satisfaction of helping another human being.
she thanked me.
and...you felt nothing.
I wasn't even sure what I was supposed to feel.
it's like your leg. It's atrophied.
keep working it. The feeling will come.
sorry.
need you. Again.
I told you to get rid of her.
it's a good thing we didn't. Tightness in her chest.
she can't breathe. It could bea pleural effusion.
right.
either that or she's holding her breath like a four-year-old.
relax.
I'm not gonna burn you again.
I'm going to stab you!
look, either you're faking or you've gota pleural effusion.
that's a buildup of fluidaround the lungs, which is very serious, and I'd have no choice but to stab you in the back with this needle and suck all the fluidout of you.
so. -we should give her a local.
that would defeat the point of me being nasty.
ready?
down. -She can't breathe if she's down.
down. -She can't
down, down, down! Come on!
that's not a pleural effusion.
the problem's in her heart.
can't fake that.
I've had to relieve the pressure three times in the last two hours.
so either we figure out what's causing blood to build up around her heart, or I follow her around with a needle for the rest of her life.
echo was clean. No structural abnormalities.
could be aninfectious process, tb.
or vasculitis would alsoplain the effusion.
but not the paralysis.
let's assume that she wasn't faking it.
she moved. Therefore, she could move.
she wasn't paralyzed.
doesn't mean she was faking. Could have been a delusion.
either she was faking and coincidentally got a real cardiac problem at the exact same time, or it's a delusion.
and the fake paralysisis a real neurological symptom.
you thinking vascular tumor in her spine?
her platelets are normal.
and she's been scanned up and down. It was all clean.
so open her up and find it.
so what do you want us to do?
start at her neck and just keep cutting down her spine until we stumble on something?
that should work.
her heart rate's a little high.
should I be worried?
probably just mean she's still in discomfort from the surgery.
I'm gonna up his morphine a little.
you've been so nice to us.
that's the job.
no, I mean, all the other doctors, all they did was obsess on the cancer, the treatment, the damage.
just trying to fix him.
you're the first doctor that's ever given a damn about the quality of his life.
his heart rate's come down.
morphine worked. I was right.
what a touching moment.
that's why we become doctors.
one of those rare moments when our hearts are warmed
would you like to get a drink?
are you serious, or are you just trying to change the subject?
no, I'm serious.
I drink. You drink.
we could do it at the same time.
at the same table.
do you eat?
we could do that, too.
I mean, if the answer is no, that's cool, but
no, it's just
you're just coming off the surgery, and you're not yourself yet.
and I work for you, and even though last year's...
you're smiling. I'm saying no, and you're smiling.
Oh, don't take it personally.
it's just 'cause you're full of crap.
you have no interest in going out with me.
maybe you did...
when I couldn't walk.
when I was a sick puppy that you could nurture back to health.
now that I'm healthy, there's nothing in it for you.
you are not healthy.
Cuddy wants to see you.
you've been back at work 24 hours, and you're already playing hide-and-seek in a woman's spine.
who won the pool?
there's no tumor.
her platelets are normal.
the scans didn't-- -what's the worst that can happen?
I paralyze her.
she wouldn't even notice.
her lawyers might.
you're not doing the surgery. And lower the morphine on your other patient.
fine, I'll lower it. If you'll let me do the surgery.
what?
you want to trade?
we're not swapping a couple of goats for your help putting up a barn.
you want something. I want something.
we compromise. It's the grown up way to resolve our differences.
there already is a mechanism for that.
it's called the employer-employee relationship.
I get what I want, and you don't.
you tried to swap?
ran a few more tests.
came back negative. Surgery's on.
you really don't give a crap, do you?
does that make me evil?
Yeah.
the girl's life is at stake. All we're talking about with the guy is
all we're talking about is the reason you took the case. To help someone.
too bad for them. -Too bad for you.
the reason we crave meaning is because it makes us happy.
the first level of happiness is
I'm not going away.
the fifth level of happiness involves creation.
changing lives.
the sixth level is heroin. The seventh level is you going away.
you're saving lives. Which is tantamount to creating lives.
but all you're taking away from this is the game.
you don't have to listen to them thanking you.
you don't have to change the cases you take or even how you handle them.
you just have to know that you made a difference.
house, you're not
I'm not an idiot.
house, leave her alone.
close her up.
wanna know why?
the room's no longer sterile.
true, but that's notthe most interesting reason.
that is not a sexy big toe.
you would never put that in your mouth.
what the hell has that got to do with-- -told you it was interesting.
it gets even better.
Scurvy?
Yeah. Drink.
like what sailors getwhen they don't eat right?
Aye-aye.
your arms and leg tissues are choked with blood.
makes it hard to move. Also damages your hairand toenails.
but I'm on this great diet. Lots of protein, lots of
no vitamin C.
now drink.
well, thank you.
and thank dr. House.
send him a note.
the nurse changed his morphine. I thought you were worried about the
it's just post-opdiscomfort. He's ready to go home.
so he won't have and pain?
eventually.
thank you.
everything else will be the same.
well, you took away his pain, and that--that changes a lot.
why don't you put him in some sort of facility?
someplace without a pool.
Yeah, I could dump him there.
except...
he's my husband.
he's my son's father.
right.
kids need a dad.
someone to play catch with, talk about girls.
mark's learned that you don't have to abandon someone
get a dog.
I'm taking care of him for the same reason you helped us.
some guy shot you, and you hallucinated?
I have a responsibility.
so he's just an anchor weighing you and your family down.
sapping your energy, wasting your life. That's the meaning you take from this.
I want to take care of him.
you enjoy this.
I can't abandon him.
so you don't want to take care of him.
taking care of him doesn't fulfill you, make you happy.
but not taking care of him would make you miserable.
okay.
here we go.
I don't need your help. I've done this a million times.
lay him back down.
do that again.
make that sound.
what was that?
that...
was talking.
you guys are lousy doctors.
you're in such a rush to make the patient feel better, you forgot to check what was wrong.
yoga girl walked out of here two hours ago. You fixed her.
not her. The other guy.
he had brain cancer. They removed it eight years ago.
his condition's been the same ever since.
until last night. He spoke.
What'd he say?
He...grunted?
you want us to dissect eight years of medical history with grunting in the differential?
sounds good. Call me when you're done.
you're fabricating a mystery because you're bored.
I am not bored.
damn it.
you didn't tell the wife it was only a grunt?
of course not.
because then she never would have consented to a bunch of dangerous tests.
I don't remember you being this bitchy.
the vicodin dulled it. In the sober light of day, I'm a buzz-kill.
you're giving false hope to a family that's been wrecked.
don't torture them.
let it go. Tell the wife it was only a grunt. Tell her to go home.
I can't let her down like that.
pumped her up with too much false hope.
Oh, I stuck that primo!
how rad am I?
2002, patient had dry eyes.
dry eyes plus a grunt.
it all makes sense.
could be a neurological issue.
I get hay fever, I put drops in my eyes. I don't go to a neurologist.
dry eyes could indicate an autonomic dysfunction.
goes on the board.
what about coughing?
or boogers? Should we include boogers?
I'm happy we're doing this.
I'd much rather do this than lengthen some guy's tendon.
patient's headaches increased.
doc scanned his head, found a tumor.
you like wasting your time?
I'm learning. -To do what?
reconsider solved cases because you don't want to deal with the real world?
he's pushing where there's nothing.
cameron, you are an excellent doctor.
you'll get lots of tearful thank-yous from grateful patients.
Yeah, am I such a bitch for wanting that?
well, it's not a bad thing. But it's not why I'm here.
I took this fellowship to learn from house.
he's teaching you to be a masochist.
dry eyes goes on the board.
in eight years, the patient experienced 214 symptoms, many of them repeating.
any patterns?
fever plus frequent urination could mean prostatitis.
or a urinary tract infection.
white count was normal. -No infection.
if you add pain into the mix, fever, frequent urination could indicate a kidney problem.
I like it.
no. Creatinine and bunwere both normal.
not the kidney part. The pain part.
abdominal pain plus all that stuff could equal pancreatic cysts.
perfect. You've managed to pick the one symptom he never had.
abdominal pain.
it's the first symptomon the board. Grunt.
grunting isn't pathognomonic for abdominal pain.
no.
the traditional diagnostic marker is compression of the diaphragm and vibration of the larynx, leading to the audible sound.
I have a painin my abdomen.
Richard's symptoms are culled from eight years of medical history.
they're not patterned. These are random, individual events over time.
illnesses have incubation periods.
do an upper endoscopic ultrasound.
his throat will collapse.
muscle degenerationin his neck won't tolerate the scope.
it's an automatic trach.
you're talking about him like he's an invalid.
we're insensitive.
does he drool? Can he hold his neck straight?
does he chokeon his food?
his neck's fine. His throat's not gonna collapse.
cameron, get consentfrom the wife.
open.
I need you to swallow.
sorry about that.
here we go.
passing through the lower esophageal sphincter, into the antrum of the stomach.
there's the tail of the pancreas.
looks clean.
moving medially, the body and the head of the pancreas look clean
get it out. Get it out.
it's stuck. I can't move it.
his throat's collapsed.
vitals are all overthe place. We're losing him.
I'm cutting.
we trached him, endoscopically removed the probe, and he's breathing again.
so, all in all, great idea.
did you get a look at the pancreas before the world ended?
it was clean.
which means, barring anything else, meaning you, he can go home tomorrow.
this man nearly died. How can you discharge him?
his throat collapsed because of what we predicted.
you stick something down someone's throat, they gag. Spasm.
which he did. It took us a half an hour to get that thing out.
except our patient's throat was sedated.
which means the brain should have sent a signal in not to do anything.
this could be cancer.
or some bizarre neurodegeneration. Even a new type of vascular
stop it.
you're enjoying this.
I find it interesting.
it's interesting only if you're right. If you're wrong, we're torturing this guy to amuse you.
half hour to remove the probe?
it's not a spasm.
his throat didn't collapse. It locked down.
brain is supposed to tell every muscle in the body to relax and contract at the same time.
this muscle was only contracting, which means a signal from the brain was not getting through.
there are no lesions his brain. Nothing to interruptany orders.
all it takes is one wire down.
you have no evidence of any wires down.
a few microtumors on the meninges, suddenly you're choking to death.
you wanna look at the lining of his brain?
the amount of contrast material you'd need to pump up there just to see
he'll bleed into his brain.
no, he won't. - Because that wouldn'tbe interesting.
you can get permission this time.
the brain is enclosed in a sack called the meninges.
does this mean the cancer's back?
no, no, no, no.
if we found cancer, it wouldn't be the original cancer. It'd be new.
so what? More surgery? More radiation?
might not be the worst thing.
if this isn't just ancient history, maybe it's something we can correct.
might even get some brain function back.
he could get better?
no.
but understanding what you're saying would be nice.
maybe you can figure out ways to communicate.
thank god he spoke to you.
Mrs. Mcneil.
the test to do this is very risky.
he could die.
he's already dead.
chase, go slow already injected into spinal canal next stop is brain contrast material entering into the fourth ventricle.
no parietal bleeds.
blood pressure's high. But it's holding.
meninges are intact. No bleeding.
Oh, god.
Foreman, get in here.
you are lucky he didn't die
I'm lucky? he is the one who didn'y die we told you he had haemorrhage you told me he bleed into his brain not out of his ear gotta drop this
I'm missing something. We did a dangerous test and something bad happened that's all. This is to give me tour of the brain. Foreman walk me through the scans 1998
what happened nothing next spec on the superior temporal region
it's regrowth, it's benign scar tissue from bioposy
house, every spec is not suspect, It's use of surgeon digging around his head. Let him go, we do every blood test he's ever had, re-scan his head. No, he's in sick in suffering for 8 years and I'm not gonna helping make it worse
I'm not gonna help you make interesting
that's okay. Foreman's better at that stuff than you are.
we need 5-millimeter cuts through the occipitaland hypothalamic regions.
no.
how many millimeters?
I can help him.
this is it? That's your argument?
seems like a good one.
if I thought for a second you wanted to help him, you'd have carte blanche.
you're doing this because it's fun.
does nobody in this hospital have anything better to talk about than my motives?
my motives have nothing to do with the case.
your motives have everything to do with your judgment.
for the first time in years, I've got no opiates in my body.
now you question my judgment.
24 times a year you comestorming into my office, spouting that you can help someone.
only you never say those words.
you say something like, "his pancreas is gonna explode because his brain is on fire."
you come here with medicine, not with platitudes.
I didn't want to bore you with the details.
there are no details.
you have a hunch.
house, you don't use hunches.
you always have reasons.
this hospital doesn't exist for your whims. I'm sorry.
as of 7: 00 A. M. Tomorrow morning, I'm sending your patient home.
the answer is no.
Cuddy called 30 seconds after you left and said you'd try an end around.
my leg hurt.
how bad?
enough that I'm telling you.
did it go away?
ached for a while.
first time I've felt anything there since the surgery.
but it went away.
it was muscular. There was some cramping.
what are you smiling about?
you're 40-something years old. You've been running god knows how many miles a day.
fallen 100 tim off that skateboard, and you're shocked to have some soreness?
just give mea prescription.
for vicodin?
house, people get aching joints, cramps, they put on an ice pack. They take some ibuprofen.
I know what the pans of middle age feel like.
no, you don't.
because you've been stuffing vicodin every five minutes since you turned middle-age.
the surgery didn't work.
don't play me.
Oh, you think this is a scam?
I think you want me to feel sorry for you and either do the end around on cuddy or give you the drugs.
either way, you get the high you think you need.
house, your surgery worked. You're fine.
it's just gonna take time for it to feel good.
the circumventricular system senses cytokines released in the early stages of the immune response.
but cvos releases prostaglandins that reset the hypothalamic set point upward, unless it's countered by anti-pyretic therapy.
so yeah, his brain is on fire.
the suicide attempt was not a suicide attempt.
he drove that wheel chair into the pool because he couldn't regulate his body temperature.
he had hypothalamicdys regulation.
and you discovered this...
when you stepped into the...
university pool?
fountain.
I can cure him. - Cure him.
even if the fountain proved anything, fixing hypothalamicdys regulation isn't gonna regenerate brain.
no, but if the scar tissue on his hypothalamus is restingagainst the pituitary, the adrenals would shut down.
Addison's disease.
you didn't see any scar tissue on his mri. His ct scans
his brain is functional. - His temperature's normal.
there is nothing wrong with his hypothalamus or his pituitary.
I can make him walk. I can make him talk.
this is a wild guess that came to you because you were sweating.
inject him with cortisol.
the guy'll have sex with his wife again. He'll hug his kid again.
hopefully that's the combination he was using.
be a shame if I cured a pedophile.
you're smiling. That's a bad sign.
you're high.
I told you I haven't had anything in three months.
this is as high as you get.
a theory that ties your case up in a neat little bow.
but you don't have a lick of substantiating proof.
your decision doesn't make any sense.
there is no risk to a cortisol injection. If I'm wrong, big deal.
he goes home a vegetable, like he already is. But if I'm right
this is not about downsides or risk management.
it is a big deal for you to understand the word no.
I'm sorry, house.
he's on his way out of here.
figured you'd be on your scooter racing down the halls to stab the patient in the neck with cortisol.
she was right to say no.
I had no objective reason to think that I was right.
just needed the puzzle.
hold on a sec.
is everything all right?
Yeah, it's just something I forgot.
what's that?
this is cortisol.
and it's to fight infection.
wanna hold onto that?
put a bandage on it.
let's see. Is he okay?
Yes.
can we go now?
you can go.
excuse me.
dad, you okay?
you're standing.
thank you.
he got up.
I have to go tell house. - No.
you can't tell him.
I have to tell him. He was right.
why did you do it?
why did you think he might be right?
because he's house.
medically. What made you think he was right?
nothing. - He got lucky.
that's all that happened.
telling him now as a good thing.
because next time, he won't get lucky. He'll kill someone.
just because he was right doesn't mean he wasn't wrong.
I see him every day.
I can't just...
everybody lies.
mom!
I'm thirsty.
I just gave you water.
I want juice.
it's bedtime.
close your eyes and go to sleep.
what do you want, Clance?
Oh. Hi, dad.
go to bed.
can I turn the TV on?
TV is only for the daytime. We have a deal.
go to bed.
dad, what if...
what if they come to get me again?
go to bed. Now.
mom!
mom!
come on, bud. It's time to get up.
I guess he's already up.
that's a first.
I-I will, uh, I'll see if he needs breakfast.
Hey, Clance, you hungry?
hon, he's not down here.
you sure?
where are you?
sweetie, are you hiding?
Clancy? - Where is he?
you're gonna being big trouble when I find you.
honey, come out right now, wherever you are. This is not funny.
Where's the sweat and the B.O.?
you've taken such pride in bathing us all in your musk.
showered at home.
and yet you're earlier than usual.
is this an intervention?
it's a little late, since I'm not using drugs anymore.
I am, however, still hooked on phonics.
if you did your morning run and showered at home, you'd be later than usual.
thought of you in the shower.
how's your leg?
you seem to be favoring your left side.
I was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday. Makes all the difference in the world.
you've taken the stairs every day. - Did I need a restraining order?
you slack on your rehab, the muscle will weaken.
and your leg will hurt again.
looks like the ketamine treatment might not stick.
or maybe we've made him depressed because we're lying to him.
telling him he got that case wrong.
we didn't hurt him. The pain isn't...
he gets depressed, he stops exercising.
he stops exercising, the muscle atrophies.
the muscle atrophies, the pain returns.
maybe he stopped exercising because the giant hole in his leg actually hurts.
the ketamine could work perfectly and he would still be back on his cane popping vicon again.
you can't tell him.
he got lucky. There was no medical...
he was right.
we tell him he was right, and we're feeding his addiction.
without vicodin, he's only got one to focus on.
well, he's not gonna O.D. on puzzles.
no, it's not gonna hurt him.
but he could just as easily have killed that patient.
we have a tiny window of time here where House may be healthy enough to change.
and based on that limp, the window's closing fast.
kid is a product of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy. Had all his vaccinations.
fractured his right ulna at age three, chicken pox at age five...
did he ever get his feelings hurt?
I'll need to know that too.
you are 0 for 1 since you came back. We just wanna make sure...
rectal bleeding plus alien abduction fantasies, most likely sexual abuse.
penetration causes the bleed, trauma causes the fantasy.
E.R. ran a rape kit, found no evidence of tearing, semen, or pubic hairs.
I think we should talk to the kid.
Why?
in case he's telling the truth?
you're a believer, aren't you?
I'm just not arrogant enough to think that of the 50 billion galaxies, 100 billion stars per galaxy and ten million billion planets in the universe, that we're the only ones with life.
no.
but I'm guessing we're the only ones who like shoving things through our backdoors.
there is new research indicating a link between neurological problems and bleeding disorders.
perfect. Especially if there were neurological problems.
what part of hallucinating an alien abduction isn't neurological?
it wasn't a hallucination.
what?
you think the kid... - Is having nightmares.
nightmares aren't a symptom of anything other than wanting to sleep with mommy.
which just leaves us with one symptom, the bloody tuchus.
which can easily be explained by a G. I. problemor a bleeding disorder.
check his coags with a PT/PTT, and bleeding time.
prep him for endoscopies from above and below.
gonna make a tiny nick in your forearm, okay?
then I'm gonna time how long it takes for you to stop bleeding.
this is gonna sting a little, so you might want to look the other way.
are those windows locked?
those windowsdon't even open. They're just here to let sunshine in.
good. 'Cause they know I'm here.
don't bother the doctor with this stuff.
no, it's okay. How do they know you're here?
they put a chip in my neck so they can keep track of me.
I can feel it back there.
clancy, you know there is nothing back there.
there is.
let me see. Lean forwards.
and they have this other thing. And they put it...in between these two ribs.
always on this side.
and then they move it around my insides. It hurts.
you know what, Clancy?
I think I might have found the chip back there.
and I think I might be able to get it out.
Really? - Mmm-hmm.
okay, lean forwards.
now hold very still, okay?
got it.
I'm seven... not three.
all you did was pinch my neck.
sorry.
his alien abduction story, the level of detail is...
I don't know where he gets it from.
the parents say he doesn't watch sci-fi, he doesn't read comic books.
great. You do any of that medical stuff we talked about?
upper and lower endoscopies were clean.
so, it's a simple bleeding disorder.
no. Blood tests were all normal. And he clotted in six minutes.
so it's a simple bleeding disorder and you screwed up the test.
I didn't screw up the test.
so it's a U. F.O.
unidentified flowing orifice.
either you screwed up the test or I screwed up my analysis of this case.
if you screwed up, I don't have to cry myself to sleep.
it's a simple bleeding disorder. Foreman, redo the test.
how could I screw up a simple bleeding time test?
maybe you were abducted and lost time.
kid's got a bleeding disorder.
you're sure?
I had to stop the bleeding myself after 25 minutes.
so you're saying Chase did screw up.
or Foreman screwed up.
big hand points to minutes. Maybe you got it mixed up.
Oh, snap.
Foreman's playin' the dozens. You're at a huge cultural disadvantage here, Chase.
take a couple minutes to think of a witty retort.
so we have contradicting bleeding time tests.
if we run labs to check his clotting factors, we can confirm which one's right.
Yeah, testing. Nice idea.
way better than trying to guess which doctor's incompetent.
looks better in the paperwork too.
Hey, Foreman, your mama's so fat, when her beeper goes off, people think she's backing up.
Where's Clancy?
he's asleep. He's...
clancy's gone missing.
Oh, no!
you take Alpha Centauri, Foreman can look on tatooine, and Cameron can set up an intergalactic checkpoint.
let's pray he hasn't gone into hyperdrive.
we'll never catch him.
I had to go where there are no windows so I could get the chip out like you said.
God.
I can feel it, I just can't grab it. - Clancy, stop!
there is no chip.
we're gonna clean you up and we're gonna go back to your room.
you can't do things like this.
your parents...
said it might not even be terrestrial.
Really?
no, you idiot, it's titanium.
like from a surgical pin.
like the kind the kid had inserted into his broken arm four years ago.
nice medical history.
that pin was removed six months after.
so a little piece broke off during removal.
titanium is used to build nuclear subs. Pieces don't just break off.
tell that to guys on the Kursk.
and how exactly did it get from his arm to the back of his neck?
body attacks any foreign object.
inflammatory reaction could erode it into a vein, fragment gets a free ride.
to his lungs, maybe. Not his neck.
Yeah, an alien chip makes more sense.
the real mystery is that you didn't actually screw up.
you okay?
fine. Tripped.
kid carved a hole in the back of his neck... and apparently didn't bleed to death.
now, that's weird.
he clotted on his own?
sure did.
so first there was no bleeding disorder, then there was, now there is not again.
which is impossible.
or Foreman screwed up. Two out of three tests agree with my findings.
well, lucky for us, the fourth test will be the charm.
so you're just gonna keep cutting him?
until what?
this test is different.
we draw some blood and see if any clotting factors are low or missing.
but why haven't the other tests...
we've got three results that haven't been consistent. One of them must be wrong.
or two of them.
is it possible the problem isn't his blood?
it's just psychological.
I mean, he almost killed himself.
he wasn't trying to hurt himself.
no...
he was just looking for an alien tracking device.
I have time for one more.
don't blame you for spending extra time down here.
heard the artist formerly known as gimp is back upstairs.
Oh, Dr. Cuddy wants that one.
she's busy. I'll take it.
Oh, my god. You're...
how...
you're okay.
have we met?
I was one of your doctors.
you were in a vegetative state when you left here last week.
Addison's disease.
all I needed was cortisol and my brain turned on like a switch.
this is amazing.
surprised you didn't know.
how would I know?
not quite my old self yet.
baby steps, the doctors tell me.
with rehab, you'll do great. What hospital did you go to?
how would I... - I wanna have sex with my wife.
and I was hoping that maybe...
you could...
Viagra? You're here for viagra?
a bucketful would be nice.
Dr. Cuddy.
Hi.
it's completely unethical.
he was reckless with a patient. - He was right.
but he didn't know that. He needs at least some glimmer of humility.
why does he need that? Because other people have that?
why does he need to be like other people?
he needs to be less reckless.
well, you did it.
he's dismissing symptoms, looking for easy solutions. He's in pain.
how much pain? - Why?
you know this is affecting him, don't you?
telling him that he got his last case right won't do anything to help him.
it'll make him less depressed. - Which might not help his leg.
but you don't know.
just let me run a PET scan on his parietal thalamic area to see if it's sensing pain.
if it is, the ketamine isn't working anymore and he's headed for a huge crash.
if it's not, the leg pain is my fault and I will tell him the truth.
too tight?
my parents think I'm crazy.
no, they don't.
they're just worried about you, that's all.
I'm not weird.
it's just that weird things keep happening to me.
slight pinch.
if you make me better, do you think the aliens will leave me alone?
I don't think they're gonna be bothering you for much longer.
you lying again? - No.
we figure this out, everything's gonna be okay.
you still with us?
pulmonary edema, stage two hypertensive crisis.
what is happening? - Wait outside.
get him oxygen. Start him on an I.V. drip of sodium nitroprusside.
get them outside!
he's in ICU. Systolic is hovering around 170.
I left instructions to lower it slowly so we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.
the trade-off being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke, M.I.And blindness.
I'm open to suggestions.
solve the case.
kidneys could explain... - Kidneys are clean.
tell me he's a mutant human hybrid.
it is a bleeding disorder. Clancy tested positive for von Willebrand's.
I didn't screw up.
how could he clot on his own two out of three times?
maybe he cheated. - Right.
kids always cheat on their bleeding time tests.
she was being metaphorical. She's trying to sound like me.
I have no idea what you meant, but I could smell what the rock was cooking.
I meant he's clotting right now and he's in hypertensive crisis.
maybe the two are related.
what if he was hypertensive the other two times that he clotted?
hypertensive crisis can activate clotting factors.
someone low on von Willebrand's could theoretically clot.
and the first time Clancy clotted, he was all worked up recounting his alien abduction.
he could have easily been hypertensive.
I know I get worked up when I cut microchip tracking implants out of my neck.
sounds like a cheat to me.
Yeah, we get it.
okay, what's the differential for seven-year-old boys suffering multiple hypertensive crises?
we think the problemis in your son's heart.
we need to do a procedure called a transesophegeal echo.
okay, and that will fix his heart?
that will tell us where the problem is.
hopefully.
then we can fix him.
listen...
this isn't really part of my job, but...
he's worried that you think he's crazy.
well, isn't he?
there are still plenty of other explanations for what's going on.
it's important he knows you believe in him.
even if you don't.
it's clean. His heart isn't the problem.
why don't I have a high-def in my office?
I'm a department head.
there are no structural defects. - Valves are intact.
tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of legos.
see, this is what I'm talking about.
Foreman, you gotta steal this thing for me.
let me ring up one of the homies.
the clearer the image, the clearer it is that there are no masses, no clots, no tears.
the problem's got to be somewhere else.
we're gonna need a bigger boat.
you're wrong, House.
think he'll make us break into the IMAX before he admits it?
there. - Where?
right there. Left side. No movement.
well, don't freeze it.
something's not moving. How do you see something not move if nothing's moving?
I need a laser pointer.
we don't havea laser pointer. - Well, why not?
who's gonna take us seriously if we don't have a laser pointer?
right here.
a few thousand myocytes' not beating with the rest.
so you found an arrhythmia.
that's not an arrhythmia. That's a no-rhythmia.
myocytes contract. These aren't movingat all.
go get me those myocytes.
I want to talk to them in my office.
how's the kid doing?
heart nearly exploded.
still beating, though.
most of it anyway.
why do they bother putting age restrictions on these things when all you have to do is click"yes, I am 18"?
even a 17-year-old can figure that out.
what's going on with the leg?
first tell me what's going on with the boobs.
if you're feeling pain... - They're firmer.
it's called an underwire.
I wanna get a PET scan of your brain.
I think it's hormones.
as long as there's no increased activity in the thalamus...
looks to me like those puppies are going into the dairy business.
then the pain can be good.
it could be muscle regenerating.
after you work out, you get sore. Pain doesn't mean the ketamine failed.
guess I should be saying. Who gets to pass out the cigars?
I'm not pregnant.
I need to geta PET scan of your brain.
boy or girl? You got a name picked out?
I'm not pregnant. - My leg doesn't hurt.
you're in denial. - No, I'm not!
Oh, you got me.
if I thought that my leg was deteriorating, don't you think I'd want to take steps to prevent that?
okay.
gotta go.
ha.
here's Clancy's DNA.
and here's the DNA from that piece of his heart we just biopsied.
that is impossible.
run it again.
we already did.
and once more after that.
the genes from Clancy's myocytes don't match the genes from the rest of his body.
alien DNA.
anybody watch any X-files that inspired an explanation?
there are ways DNA can become mutated.
extreme UV radiation.
that much sun, he'd be dying with a healthy bronze glow.
nitrous acid or ethidium bromide exposure.
first daddy was a rapist, now he's a chemist.
various species of fungus have been proven mutagenic.
not unless the kid's been eating barrels of celery or living in Indonesia or both.
is your leg hurting? - Is that question helping?
you're leaning. - You're sitting.
you're evading. - My head's hurting.
please, someone give me a plausible, terrestrial explanation for this kid's alien DNA.
we could search his home for toxins, fungals, and radiation.
who cares what caused it?
a kid comes in with a strep, we don't conduct a search to see which classmate he got it from, we cure it.
we know he's got this inside him. Let's get a scalpel and cut it out.
where do we cut? Chances are it's not just in his heart.
we got lucky with the heart.
myocytes contract, we could see that these weren't working.
I don't know how the hell we're gonna find it anywhere else.
what if we take the heart cells with the bad DNA and we tag them?
can you phrase that in the form of a metaphor?
it's the same way we search for cancer.
the bad DNA creates a unique protein on the surface of the affected cells.
we create an antibody that recognizes only that protein.
we flush it throughout his system and the similar cells light up like...
lightbulbs.
okay. Let's do that.
you have to tell him.
he said he wasn't in any pain. - He's lying.
of course he's lying.
we need another plan.
don't talk about it that way.
what way?
plan. Sounds like we're conspiring against him.
I'm gonna tell him. - No, you're not.
then come up with a cunning plan and fast.
she's not nearly as delightful as she thinks she is.
what's this machine do?
it makes a lot of noise.
and it's gonna help us figure out what's wrong with you.
you think House has lost a step?
he's fine.
there, a clump of affected cells in the bone marrow of the femur.
explains the intermittent bleeding disorder.
cause I don't need to subject myself to House's torture if there's no upside.
I'm telling you, he's fine.
we missed some affected cells in his heart.
explains the continuing hypertensive issues.
you said the last case really threw him. And now suddenly...
I was wrong.
so you changed your mind.
Why?
his brilliant ideas on this case have all been yours.
there's the reason for him needing glass.
apparently it's a symptom. Means the condition predates...
you don't change your mind without a reason.
what do you know?
didn't blow the last case.
Cuddy cured the guy using House's idea.
Cuddy and Wilson are trying to teach him some humility.
scan is complete. Three hot spots, but nothing in his brain.
house's original theory was right.
it is not neurological.
is he gonna be able to walk?
his leg should be functional after some rehab.
functional? What does that mean?
he's be able to walk but not run? He'll have a limp?
if everything goes well, he'll walk, he'll run.
he'll probably be even stronger than he is now.
when we close him up, we'll move over to his other leg.
snake a catheter up through the femoral artery and into his heart.
once the affected areas are removed, his normal tissue will set back in and do its job.
he should have no more problems with his blood pressure.
after confirming those areas are clear, we'll start the final procedure.
I'm gonna insert a needle through the pupil and get rid of the abnormal cells in the retina.
close your right eye.
can you see my face?
Yeah. It's clear.
you can throw away your glasses. We got it all.
get some sleep.
you're going home tomorrow.
thank you.
you wanna go for a run?
what do you want?
I want you to run.
when did you become an enabler?
I'm enabling you to exercise.
vicodin blocks the pain, you get through your rehab.
muscle strength increases, and pain decreases.
I'd rather not become dependent on pain pills to get through my day.
you're just like any other patient.
running away from knowledge that won't make you happy.
I'm as happy as a pig in poop.
you're scared the ketamine treatment's wearing off.
that it was just a torturous window to the good life.
what part of poop didn't you understand?
how can you be so sure it isn't just a sore muscle?
it's my leg.
we've known each other a long time.
you're not always right, House.
you've proven that lately.
what's happening to him? - He's seizing.
I need clonazepam. - I thought you got it all!
Yeah, yell at me. That'll fix the kid.
obviously we missed some foreign tissue. There's something still in him.
the hallucinations and seizures indicate problems in the temporal lobe.
sorry, House, it is neurological.
looks like you were wrong, again.
we didn't miss anything.
the brain scan was completely clean.
our tag must not have penetrated the blood brain barrier.
don't use an IV this time, get it right into the brain.
no cells are lighting up.
his brain is clean.
it is not neurological.
his symptoms are neurological.
his condition has to be neurological.
his scan was clean twice.
it's not there.
what if it is there, but didn't show up on the scan?
what if the tag just doesn't work in his brain?
brain cells are structurally different. They express a different protein.
so how do we find it?
where are we going?
I am going to think.
send the kid home.
what do you mean?
make sure his blood pressureis stabilized and send him home.
like nothing ever happened?
we cured his bleeding disorder and removed all the damaged cells we could find.
we don't know that we fixed anything. It's only been a day.
maybe these symptoms come and go like the blood disorder.
it's more probable that his remaining symptoms are just a nightmare.
he had a convulsion.
maybe epilepsy, maybe psychological.
maybe nothing.
if the kid gets sick again, that'll give us another clue and we'll start searching again.
if he doesn't, it doesn't matter.
send him home.
you're just giving up on this kid?
you gotta know when to stop.
you don't stop.
you never stop, you just keep on going until you come up with something so insane that it's usually right.
except on my last case.
don't be pathetic.
just forget the last case.
this kid obviously has something wrong with him.
when did you develop such strong opinions about my patients?
last week you were convinced that my patient wasn't sick.
now you're convinced this one is.
this one is a young boy.
his parents are desperate.
just get together with your team, spend a few extra hours...
well, I guess we could amputate his left leg.
it's where we found most of it. Maybe we should just remove his affected eye completely.
if you have reason to believe that that might help...
I'm not gonna start lopping off body parts.
but it's interesting that you give me the green light.
I just want you to do something.
you've been overly supportive this entire week.
well, either you're hormonal or you're guilt-ridden.
and it's too early in the pregnancy for this to be hormonal.
I'm not pregnant. - Then what did you do wrong?
he had Addison's.
your last patient. You were right.
I gave him one shot of cortisol and he woke up like Rip Van Winkle.
Oh, your mommy's in such trouble.
she's such a liar.
that's why you don't have a daddy. That's why she had to...
how does one person end up with two different sets of DNA?
we've been through this. - Our assumptions are faulty.
we've confirmed two different sets of DNA. We re-ran the sequence.
I didn't say the lab work was faulty, I said our assumptions were faulty.
we assumed he's a person.
of course. The aliens didn't just visit him, they replaced him.
you're being silly.
what if he's not a person? What if he's two persons?
I'm not getting the metaphor. - No metaphor.
chase said the mom used in vitro fertilization, right?
Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.
kid was right all along. He was implanted with something.
back when he was young. I mean, really young. Like 12 cells young.
in vitro increases the likelihood of twinning.
but he doesn't have a twin.
not walking around...
but in vitro fertilization costs around 25 grand a pop.
so doctors implant two to six embryos to make sure you get your money's worth.
the problem is, there's not always enough bedrooms for all the kiddies.
two brothers get stuck sharing, but there's no bunk beds.
so they cuddle up to keep warm and they never untangle.
he's two people in one.
it's called chimerism.
unfortunately, his brother's...
like a bad doubles partner.
the guy just takes up space, gets in the way.
clancy's body thinks he's gonna put away the easy winners, his brother just keeps swatting the balls into the net.
we gotta get him off the court.
so does that mean that you can find the bad cells in his brain or not?
sure, abandon the metaphor. Fine.
clancy thinks differently than his brother... because he thinks.
if we inducean alien abduction...
wait, what the hell are you talking about?
the foreign DNA has got to be in the portion of your son's brain that makes him believe that he's being abducted.
if we stimulate those neurons with an electric probe, we can trick your son's brain into hallucinating.
your son's neurons will light up, and his brother's cells will remain dark.
those are the ones we cut out.
you're talking about brain surgery.
I'm talking about really cool brain surgery.
one of your sons will die.
but the taller one won't be so annoying anymore.
so I have a twin?
not really.
what's on the card?
light bulb.
start us out at ten.
I'm not doing that.
it was all me, kid. Sorry.
you're in motor function.
try two centimeters back.
he lives inside me.
sort of.
that tickles. Stop tickling my feet.
you're in sensory. Getting closer.
what do you see on this one? - Moon and stars.
so...
I am kind of weird?
we're all kind of weird.
No!
Clancy? - We got something.
what do you see? - The light.
here they come. I think.
brain waves indicate mild hallucination.
neurons are lighting up. - Any dark spots?
area's too fuzzy. - Hallucination isn't strong enough.
turn up the juice.
his blood pressure's already at 160 over 110. Any higher and...
riding the short bus is better than not breathing.
take us to 100.
area's still too fuzzy to make any kind of distinction.
crank it up higher.
you've already exceeded the pre-set maximum.
next step's brain damage.
they're gonna get you. They're coming through the walls.
they're gonna take you, torture you.
you'll never see your parents again.
clancy, can you hear me?
you got them.
Yep.
we got 'em all.
close him up.
everything's gonna be normal again.
you believe what Cuddy tried to pull?
what now?
she lied to me.
she cured my patient with my diagnos, then she lied about it.
that doesn't sound like her.
you're right.
does sound like you, though.
what exactly did Cuddy tell you?
nothing that your body language isn't telling me right now.
so what was the plan?
I'd feel so humbled by missing a case...
that I'd re-evaluate my entire life, question the nature of truth and goodness, and become Cameron?
something like that.
more that if we told you the truth, that you'd solved a case based on absolutely no medical proof, you'd think you were god.
and I was worried your wings would melt.
God doesn't limp.
what are you doing down here?
I thought you usually had lunch with coma guy.
this is vegetative state guy. Better company.
Hey, tell him about those Sherpas you dropped acid within St. Patrick's Cathedral.
you stole my prescription pad, and you forged my name.
what did you tell the cop? - I lied.
they'd have put you away for ten years.
after they took your license to practice medicine.
so everything's good, then. - I lied to the cops.
there is no case unless they can prove that either I got the drugs illegally or I sold them illegally.
I didn't do the second. You lied about the first. Game over.
Yeah. Tritter's just playing.
he's gonna see how clever you are and then just walk away.
the important thing is that you keep prescribing the same amount of drugs to me, or it'll look suspicious.
here's another way to look at it.
having forced me to lie to the police, your first concern is securing your drug connection.
joining my father for lunch?
I should've called ahead for a table.
Dr. House was just-- - enjoying a reuben.
it's okay.
after ten years, anything that'll get doctorsin the same room as
what are you doing? - Nothing.
what are you doing?
chips?
wanna see something really cool?
I saw you leaving last Tuesday.
practically tripped over two guys on your way out, but you had no problem opening doors.
it's called akinetopsia.
you can't see things when they move.
and since you haven't been hit by a bus, I assume that it's intermittent.
it's probably accompaniedby seizures, which made me think that I could set one off by flashing them, god, I love this family!
I can see fine now.
I've had seizures before.
most of the time, they're small.
doctors ran me through all the tests.
couldn't find anything.
any history of epilepsy in your family?
the only things I know that run in my family are a lot of chutzpah and the ability to sleep for ten years.
although i'm not really an expert.
dad never really liked my mother's side of the family, and after she died and he came here,
I was raised by a guardian.
I wouldn't even know how to get in touch with him.
how about your father's side of the family?
any relatives we could speak with?
my father was an only child.
and my grandparents are dead.
well, who did you put down as the person the hospital should contact in an emergency?
I left it blank. - there's gotta be someone. A friend?
Oh, plenty of friends. Just...
no one that would care if I was here.
say, do you mind passing me my backpack?
hair of the dog.
could be infection. - or a brain tumor.
says he had a CT.
what's wrong with the simplest explanation? Trauma.
he didn't report any injuries.
he didn't report being an alcoholic, either.
drinking equals falling down, equals trauma, equals maybe it's inherited.
how would you jump to genetics from his eeg?
all you've got are some vaguely epileptiform waves.
it's not his eeg. It's his father's.
when it comes to cortical seizures, like father, like son.
small seizures aren't unheard of in a patient in a vegetative state.
similarities are interesting, though.
what caused the vegetative state?
his house burned down.
went back into get his wife.
firefighters found him unconscious three feet from the bedroom, asphyxiated.
not an inherited condition.
test his DNA.
start with a drenomyeloneuropathy.
check out the home.
he has a single bed. - They still make single beds?
could mean he just doesn't have sex-- though there were condoms in the apartment.
house asked you to check out the home for toxins.
no mold, no leaks, no pets.
MRI and lp are both inconclusive. Infection's still possible.
tumor's less likely, but-- -DNA?
Adrenomyeloneuropathy test was negative.
DNA test again. Try unverricht-lundborg and late-onset lafora's.
genetic tests take forever.
you can't just keep testing for every inherited condition you think it might be.
well, not me. I'll be leaving early. But you guys can.
you said no one's been sick, but what about delivery people, repair guy?
I wouldn't know. I work from home.
haven't been to the office in over a month.
visitors? - Haven't had any.
the only person I've seen in the last week was the pizza delivery guy.
and he looked pretty healthy.
there's gotta be someone you're close to.
actually, the person I see most often is my father.
he's asleep, so he can't stop me.
what is it? - Just feeling a little nauseous.
I--I think his liver's failing. - Oh, god.
Does--does that mean that I'm
I need a central line kit. Two units of packed red blood cells, type o negative.
he's unconscious and heading for a coma.
he's at a four on the RLA's scale.
stop all treatment.
you think this is a reaction to our meds?
well, they're obviously not helping.
given the fact that he's an alcoholic, there's a good chance his liver wasn't so hot when he came in.
anti-seizure drugs could have just pushed him over the edge.
we take him off those meds, what do we put him on?
I was hoping you'd know.
may be academic, but I just started him on dialysis.
kidney and liver failure.
not too many people come back from that.
trauma's out of the picture. It could still be infection.
or neurological. - Or genetic.
we needa better history.
did you miss the part where the patient lost consciousness?
L-dopa?
you're not waking Kyle.
you're waking his father.
I commend your observational skills.
you have no reason to think any amount of drugs will wake a man from a coma.
vegetative state. Much easier.
this guy's no Terry Schiavo.
his brain's all there. He moves around. His muscles have barely atrophied.
just waitingfor a fairytale kiss.
after I do that, stick a needle in him.
the amount of amphetamines alone would be dangerous, besides whatever the hell else you've got in there.
there are reports out of south africa about a pill that would temporarily revive someone in a vegetative state.
we've all seen awakenings. Made me cry.
I wanna cry.
put the syringe down.
I can out-draw you, mysterious stranger.
we don't experiment on helpless patients.
be reasonable. There's no way this is gonna work.
even if you woke him, it would only be for a few hours.
a day, two at the most. You're risking his life.
I'm risking getting sued. That's the only objection here.
you'll be torturing him. And his family.
good news for legal. The only family he's got is upstairs dying.
Hey!
I want this patient monitored for the next 24 hours.
I want someone with him at all times to make sure you didn't kill him.
I want your ass in my office
God. I'm starving.
I could really go for a steak.
do you know your name?
you know where you are?
Gabriel Wozniak. I don't know the name of this hospital.
how much are three and five? - Eight.
also known as 1/2 of 16, 1/4 of 32, two to the third power.
coolest thing ever.
any history of seizurein your family? - No.
liver disease? - No.
how long have I been here?
I--I got the feeling it's, um, been a long time.
interesting. If your internal clock kept ticking, how deep does that awareness go?
pick up scraps of conversations?
you have the vague sense that the hospital administrator dresses like a trollop?
or that the new Star Wars movies were a disappointment?
I know my wife is dead.
I don't know how long it's been.
ten years.
what's the last thingyou remember?
the fire.
my wife was in the bedroom. She had takena sleeping pill. I got...
Kyle out. Went back in for her.
I knew I didn't make it. - I'm sorry.
what about your wife's side of the family? Any history of seizures there?
your son Kyle is a patient here.
I'm afraid his condition is serious.
he may be dying.
no seizure issues on my wife's side, either.
what about that steak? Nobody ever answered me.
rumor in the cafeteria was caustic guy was waking up coma guy.
technically, vegetative state guy was woken by...
Yeah, caustic guy. - So what happened?
gotta get him a steak before I can ask him many more questions.
he doesn't want to talk about his son?
didn't seem to emotionally register that his son is sick.
brain issue? He was asphyxiated, spent ten years as asparagus.
who knows what damageis in there? - It's possible.
course, there's always the simple explanation.
maybe he just doesn't like his son.
only in your world would that be simple.
the delusion that fathering a child installs a permanent geyser of unconditional love.
maybe your father's feelings were conditional. Not everyone's...
Yes, well, of course, that would play into your romantic vision of human.
in terms you would understand, we have an evolutionary incentiveto sacrifice for our offspring, our tribe,our friends. Keep them safe.
except for all the people who don't.
everything is conditional.
you just can't always anticipate the conditions.
mind if we talk for a few minutes?
how many pills would you say Dr. House takes a day?
I'm uncomfortable setting a number.
mm, try.
six.
a day.
has he ever had you...
write prescriptions for him?
no. What is it you want me to say?
that he takes too many pills and is a danger to the hospital?
or he takes too few because he's selling them on the side?
either one is ridiculous.
I meant the former. - You're wrong.
can I ask what Dr. House has done to deserve your loyalty?
he's not known as a great boss. He's not even much of a friend.
I mean, look how he left Dr. Wilson holding the bag.
it's odd. You don't know about that.
you defend him, and he won't even tell you what's happening in his life.
I was paged. - Saw you with a cop.
What'd he want?
how many pills does House take, did I ever write him a prescription, that sort of stuff.
I told him six. - A day, or in a mouthful?
I was just hoping you guys would stay consistent with
he wants to talkto us, too? - You're next.
we've gotta tell House what's going on.
Tritter says no. - Then no it is.
cops have a thousand ways to make life difficult for you.
quick, what's the kid's status?
I gotta get back to our sleeper before he goes looking for the orgasmatron.
see, if that were rhetorical, it would mean that I could just turn around and leave now. Which I'm not doing.
from which you should deduce
he's off all drugs except the antibiotics.
his liver's just managing to hang in there.
he's still sliding into coma.
your barber sucks.
Hey.
coma diet. I could make a fortune.
vegetative state diet.
who gave you your clothes? - Dr. Cuddy.
I guess I'll need all new ones anyway. Everything went in the fire.
Ah, don't worry about it.
we use recyclable clothes now. Wear them once, then eat them.
your son's measles vaccination.
do you remember if he had it and what type it was?
man, you're a piece of work, you know that?
you weren't gonna tell me, were you?
I don't need new clothes. Dr. Cuddy says my body will adjust to the drugs.
that I'll be a vegetable againby tomorrow.
if I'm really lucky, the day after.
Yeah.
if I got a day to live, I'm not gonna spend it in a hospital roombeing grilled.
come on, where you gonna go?
your house burned down. Your wife's dead. Business was sold off.
the only thing you have left is down the hall heading for a liver biopsy.
used to be this little, um, hole in the wall.
run by a guy named Gian Carlo.
made the best hoagies in the world.
real italian rolls. Prosciutto. Provolone.
how far is Atlantic city from here?
you have one day to live. And you want a sandwich.
people on death row get a last meal. - State provides it.
who's providing for you? You got a car? Money?
you're negotiating with me.
take out another hundred for me.
and I need your car.
I'm not doing you any favors.
you'll get it back tomorrow. Two days, max. Road trip.
this is like trying to control the weather, but I'd prefer it if you didn't eat in the car.
I just had it detailed. - I drive.
Oh, the hell he does. - Sure.
aside from the fact he just woke upfrom a vegetative state, the guy doesn't have a license.
how about this? Cops stop us, we lie.
you know how to do that. Chips.
it's all the drugs pumping through his system.
right now, his reflexes are better than Dale Earn Hardt Jr's.
Hey, what's this? It says, "IPP-ODD."
I'm coming.
so let's talk about toxic exposure.
what was wrong with the old colors? I trusted brown.
do the purple ones have chocolate inside?
raspberry cocaine.
this house that burned down. Where was it?
Moorestown, New Jersey.
listen, I really need to know about the candy because I'm allergicto berries.
you didn't mention that. - Is it significant?
no.
so where else did you live? List everywhere, including vacations.
start with when your wife got pregnant.
we lived in Jersey. Then we moved to Jersey. From there, Jersey.
what are you waiting to hear?
about the little cottage in the amazon with the mosquitoes and the lead paint all over the walls?
Yes.
you know what?
I didn't let you come along so you could suck all the fun out of my one day of life.
well, you're outta luck, 'cause that's totally why I'm here.
okay. Rule change.
person with the money makes the rules.
or in this case, the person who's friends with the person with the money makes the rules.
well, you want answers more than I want money.
all right, so here's the game. Ask whatever you want.
but for every question I answer, you have to answer one first.
and why would you care about anything I have to say?
the day before I died, I was a successful man.
I had a factory with over 200 employees.
people listened when I talked. I liked power.
now the only power I have left is the power to annoy you.
took Wilson's assistant for coffee.
Why? - Something Tritter said.
she told me the police think that house stole Wilson's prescription pad and forged his name.
You...believe it?
do you? - Oh, absolutely. I do.
I'm just checking how naive you are.
he's not gonna steal his best friend's pad, jeopardize his career.
until his best friend says no to him.
house is a junkie.
junkies do whatever they have to do to get what they need.
Kyle's down to a three on the rlas scale.
he's only showing localized response.
I'll call House. Tell him we're gonna need an answer soon.
get in your right lane for 295. And pass me the twizzlers.
I'm curious. - No, you're not.
why would a man's first instinct be to drive away from the only family he's got?
No! This is no time for you to do your thing.
we don't care about his state of mind. We don't care if he's happy.
this factory of yours. What did you make?
so ask me a question. - I'm thinking.
only six left, by the way.
so sign my name. You don't need a doctor. You need a pen.
what is up with you two?
Wilson lied to the bulls to keep me out of the big House.
are you out of your mind? - Well, who's he gonna tell?
by tomorrow night, he's gonna b ea mindless stalk of celery.
since I answered that one, by the way, my turn.
what did you make in your factory? - Luxury boats.
have you ever been in love? - Wow.
going right for the closets with the embarrassing stuff.
good move. Yes. Describe the boats.
35- to 65-foot hulls. Twin engines, parquet floors in the galleys, staterooms with queen beds.
how'd you meet? - She shot me.
these boats. I assume you used mildew-resistant painton the hulls?
naturally. Shot you?
paintball. Doctors versus lawyers.
you ever take your son to the factory? - Sure.
he used to run all over the place, but it was perfectly safe.
ever love anybody else?
no more questions. I got my answer.
while dad's in the office, son's watching them spray-paint.
and what kid wears a mask?
mercury specifically targets the central nervous system.
are you saying this was my fault?
mercury poisoning explains the seizures.
the liver is likea big soup strainer.
soup runs through. Chicken dumplings stay.
for soup, read blood. For chicken dumplings
I get it, I get it. Mercury.
sits more or less idle until your kid pours tequila shooters into his liver.
when the liver goes, takes out the kidneys. Explains everything.
Yeah, it's me. Foreman, draw blood. Test for mercury poisoning.
chase. Start heavy metal chelation while we're waiting for results.
chase isn't here. I'll start the
where is he?
the lab.
how many pills does he take a day? - It's hard to say.
pain levels vary over time. Could be six, eight, ten.
ever write any prescriptions for him?
Yes. - Why? Did he tell you to?
he asked me to.
Medicine...attracts people who are attracted to power.
I know how he hates when he is defied by a patient.
I doubt he handles defiance from his staff any better.
now, you correct me if I'm wrong.
but I don't think Dr. House asks for anything.
I think he takes it.
and I think that you are stuck lying to the police to cover up something...
you didn't want to do.
we have been up and down st. James like a monopoly car.
it's not here. Gian Carlo has left the building.
we could still turn around and go back to Princeton.
No! We've come this far. I'm getting the hoagie.
if your son does have mercury poisoning, there's a good chance he'll respond to the chelation.
you might be able to have a few minutes with him before you lapse.
why are you so concerned about me?
deep inside, Wilson believes that if he cares enough, he'll never have to die.
your behavior isn't normal. - And you would know normal.
what could he have done that you won't forgive after ten years, when this is your last chance?
my son is what he is.
his mother's side? All drunken losers.
he's gone the same way.
house told you that drinking had damaged your son's liver.
I just said that.
but you didn't hear him say that till after we left the hospital.
so why did you leave?
maybe your son takes after your side.
seizures and an allergy to emotional connections. - Okay, okay, okay. Enough.
we're in Atlantic city, and my time's not up yet.
we'll find a hotel with a casino.
bp's starting to drop.
O2-sat's down to 70.
0. 3 milligrams of epi in.
what are you trying to do? Make him bleed faster?
check the pulse.
it's not his liver.
it's the heart.
I understand he's a french chef, but I'm sure he can handle this.
we need a 12-inch italian roll, oregano vinegar
no. Not balsamic vinegar. Oregano vinegar.
quid pro quo, Clarice. Game's still on.
I thought the answer was mercury poisoning.
what other questions would you care about?
if you each had one day to live, you'd look for one last meal, and house would look for one last answer.
no, can you just send the ingredients up here?
and I'll make it myself.
last ten years. How much awareness did you have?
I don't know. I knew it wasn't the next day.
I--I knew that-- I recognized your voice.
how often were you in my room?
no. You're wasting a question.
I have a better one.
why steal my pad? - Oh, my god. You're right.
I'm an addict. Thanks for opening my eyes.
no, I mean, why my pad?
Foreman, Cameron, and Chase's pads are just as convenient.
but their association with you is involuntary. They're employees.
I associate with you through choice.
and any relationship that involves choice you have to see how far you can push before it breaks.
this is easy.
you ask the questions, answer them, and make tasty snacks.
let's go try the casino.
and one day, our friendship will break.
and that'll just prove your theory that relationships are conditional, and you don't need human connection, or deserve it, or whatever goes on in that rat maze of your brain.
sorry. If I'd known he was gonna be this annoying,
I would've stolen dr. Cameron's pad and dr. Foreman's car.
at least she appreciates my brooding melancholy.
house's house of whining. State your complaint.
patient's bp just dropped like a stone. - Do an echo.
mercury isn't likely to damage-- - it didn't.
mercury test was negative.
do an echo.
I was wrong. Your son's still dying.
I need to go over every relative you ever had again.
this time, forget their diseases. Just tell me how they died.
we don't have time to take turns.
gimme the answers. You get a big one at the end.
you go for whatever you want. Destroy my privacy, my dignity.
your grandmother? - Heat exhaustion. Fourth of july picnic.
the woman was 92.
does anyone in the kitchen know the hoagie shop that used to be on st. James place?
your sister-in-law with the diabetes.
as far as you know, is she still alive? - She's not.
killed in a traffic accident driving home from a Phillies game.
I'm sure a lot of beer was consumed.Phillies lost.
your father? - Old age. Heart finally gave out.
your wife's father? - Hit-and-run.
walking the incontinent dog.
uh, hi. Do you guys deliver?
let me put it this way. If you deliver, there'll be a $100 tip in it for you.
Excellent! Victory.
ha, ha, the night is finally going my way.
Wilson, toss me a soda.
shall we go somewhere to talk?
house is an ass. But he obviously needs pain medication.
how much pain one person feels is not a call the government should be making.
so you think I'm a bureaucrat with a badge following some arbitrary guideline.
Yeah. I do. - Oh.
so you're saying I should... just trust him. Do you?
you're not qualified to make that-- - I'm not sure you are, either.
I've been a cop for 20 years, and not a day goes by that someone doesn't try to sell me someself-serving story.
if you had my job, you'd know.
everybody lies.
think you've run out of relatives.
so. It's my turn.
why did you become a doctor?
that's the big question?
I gave you complete license to humiliate me, and that's the best you can do?
well, okay. Let's discuss the wonder of the human body.
no, no, no. You're a curious guy.
you like to figure things out. Why not go into research?
why work with people when you... obviously hate people?
oedipal fixation.
I was seeking my mother's love, and she thought that Ben Casey was just the dreamiest
okay, fine. You don't think you'll need any more answers from me?
give me a hard time.
when I was 14, my father was stationed in Japan.
I went rock climbing with this kid from school.
he fell, he got injured, and I had to bring him to the hospital.
we came in through the wrong entrance and passed this guy in the hall.
it was a janitor.
my friend came down with an infection and the doctors didn't know what to do.
so they brought in... the janitor.
he was a doctor.
and a buraku.
one of Japan's untouchables.
his ancestors had been slaughterers, gravediggers.
and this guy, he knew that he wasn't accepted by the staff.
didn't even try. He didn't dress well.
he didn't pretend to be one of them.
the people that ran that place, they didn't think that he had anything they wanted.
except when they needed him.
because he was right.
which meant that nothing else mattered.
and they had to listen to him.
thank you.
need 20 milligram sof diazepam in a syringe.
heart beat's irregularand accelerating.
it's at 200. - He's gonna crash.
allergic reactionto the diazepam? - Better hope so.
it's either that, or his heart's done.
what happened on the night of the fire?
Yeah, I'm sure it's a stressful emotional question.
suck it up.
my wife had takena sleeping pill and gone to bed. It was christmas eve.
I let Kyle pop corn in the fireplace. He managed to...
knock loose some tinder.
wrapping paper caught on fire.
spread. So fast. I got Kyle out.
and when I went back in for
you're a disappointment.
you act as though you don't need anybody.
you--you just blame your son for what happened.
I don't blame him. He was a 12-year-old boy.
you don't blame a kid for an accident.
then what are we doing here? Why aren't you with him?
because it wouldn't matter!
I failed to keep my family safe!
I couldn't stop the fire. I couldn't save my wife!
now you want meto stick around watching while I fail to save my son.
thank you so much for waking me up.
how did your son dislodge the tinder?
he dropped the popcorn tray.
he had been complaining it was too heavy. I should've listened.
and the hit-and-run. Walking the pissy dog.
that happen at night? - I think so, yeah. Why?
car accident after the phillies lost. Night game?
ragged red fiber. It's an inherited condition.
dropping things, muscle weakness. Poor night vision.
makes people seem uncoordinated, accident-prone, careless.
it's transmittedin mitochondrial DNA.
so it only passes through the mother.
your wife's family weren't drunks. They were sick.
it wouldn't have affected his liver. - The kid is a drunk.
he thinks that he killed his mother and turned his father into a vegetable.
you know, I might have a few shots myself.
foreman. - Test his DNA for ragged rediber.
it's not gonna-- - Here's a thought.
why don't we not assume that the test is negative until we actually do it?
house. The kid has severe cardiomyopathy.
alcoholic. No shot at a transplant.
so yeah, maybe you figured out why. Good for you, but...
he's gonna die anyway.
I want to give Kyle my heart.
this thing--whatever it is-- you said he gets it from the mother. My heart's fine.
and it could go on being fine for the rest of your life.
Yeah. It's not like he's gonna do anything with it.
well, you woke him up once.
maybe someone will come up with some other answer.
we've both seen breakthroughs no one expected.
and ragged red fiber's treatable, but not curable.
even if he gets your heart, there's no guarantee.
he's my kid.
no. Did you really expect a different answer?
we have arranged transplants before when a patient is near death.
except he isn't near death.
he's saying,"kill me and cut out my heart."
are you out of your mind?
fine. I'll think of something else.
I'm sorry.
Wilson. Get out.
no.
you've lied to the cops enough for me.
maybe I don't wanna push this till it breaks.
pills are the simplest.
hanging has less chance of damaging the heart.
I'm okay with pain.
strangulation is better than breaking your neck.
which means this'll be slow.
I wouldn't get to see him even if we got in the car right now and broke the speed limit driving back, would I?
no.
tell him
I don't know what to tell him.
think it's my turn to ask a question, isn't it?
I don't think so.
cause you just asked me that thing about the speed limit.
what do you wanna know?
if if you could hear one thing from your father, what would it be?
it wouldn't help you. - Try me.
I'd want him to say...
you were right. You did the right thing.
Yeah. It doesn't help.
Hi. - Hi.
I'm Dr. Wilson. - I'm Mrs. Schaeffer.
I'm from Princeton.
my husband and I and our three children live in Philadelphia.
so, uh... do you like to swing?
no.
well, if you change your mind, I'm in
house. House! Is it room 622? 642?
Yeah.
alibi. - I figured.
they found an open bottle of aspirin by the body.
lucky he had a headache.
reduced trauma to the heart in transit.
lucky.
that can't be all.
well, you got a heart out of it.
how many organs do you want from the guy?
I mean, my father must have said something.
he couldn't just--he must have given you some kind of a message for me.
he said you were right. You did the right thing.
right about what?
what does that mean?
how would I know? He's your dad.
you know what I found interesting about this case?
that it proved that people can love unconditionally, and you can tell yourself it's not true, but you'll just end up in a hotel room in Atlantic city asking someone to cut your heart out?
the hoagie.
you thought this guy was emotionally confused and that the hoagiewas just a mask to hide his real feelings towards his son.
it was.
did you know Tritter was talking to your team while we were away?
Yeah.
and yet you moved heaven and earth to get him that mask with mustard and prosciutto.
which one of them told you? - All of them.
which means that none of them said anythingI have to worry about.
back to the hoagie.
you think that my addiction's out of hand.
your need to be needed is so strong that you'll give people what they want, what they need, what they think they need.
I don't think my enabling is anything you should be complaining about.
Yes, my name is dr. James wilson. Accot number 835687.
the ATM says I've got zero
what does that mean--a hold?
Yeah, okay. Thanks.
my accounts have been frozen as part of a police investigation.
they can't keep your money forever.
no, they can keep it till I agree to help send you to prison for ten years.
you're getting dinner.
all right, stand here.
you're just tall enough.
I--I don't--I don't think I am.
it just goes around.
there's nothingto be scared of, all right?
I didn't say I was scared.
it'll be fun. Come on.
when I was a kid, this was my favorite thing ever.
I don't like rides.
all right, all right. I just--I though tit'd be fun.
I shouldn't be making you do this.
uh...Let's go home. We can have fun at home.
no, daddy, wait.
the ride does look like fun.
Oh, this is awesome!
Alice, are you all right?
honey, you all right?
Alice! Alice, are you okay?
nothing happened. - something happened.
it was a little kiddie ride. - She hates those rides.
I don't understand why you insist on making
okay, I appreciate the fullness of your answers, but I just wanted to know if she had any historyof abdominal problems.
no. - No.
the admitting doctornoted no family history of
I have an aunt with Crohn's disease.
you didn't mention that? - I--I forgot what it was called.
your aunt has got a million things wrong with her.
if you paid attention for five minutes.
I doubt it's crohn'S. She has none of the other systems.
you're alone with her for eight hours, she ends up in the hospital.
I'm wondering if we can focus on answering the questions, Mrs. Hartmann.
I'm not Mrs. Hartmann. We're divorced.
I suspected.
and your pasgenerosity made me think of you.
we're half a million dollars from our goal.
of course, this is a naming opportunityfor your foundation.
is--is there a problem?
there's somethingon your face.
it's, uh--ahem.
excuse me.
Oh! - Oh, god.
I'm sitting in there hoping it's a sniper because at then the sociopa thisn't my employee.
this baby won me second place in the clinic's weekly "weirdest thing pulled out of an orifice" contest.
I am this close to putting a new lab in oncology.
you do not want to know what came in first.
house. - Rhymes with "fucchini."
give me his pills.
Where's my prescription? - No more free floating prescriptions.
princeton pd has already forced wilson to shut down.
a cop says boo, Wilson shuts down.
every doctor in this place is afraid to make a move without covering his ass.
do you think maybe you're shouting at the wrong person?
Tritter's obviously out to get me. He doesn't care
your forged prescriptions! - Allegedly.
your pain has become my pain.
from now on you get reasonable dosesat reasonable times.
but I hurt in an unreasonable way.
then dip into your secret stash. - Tritter took it.
then move onto your secret secret stash. - I ran out.
then move onto your secret secret secret stash.
parents say she's not on any med.
if the pancreatitis wasn't set off by drugs, and she hasn't been sick, that leaves traumaor some kind of structural defect. Put up the ct.
what's that density there? - Shadow. Looks normal to me.
we got a referral from-- - excuse me.
you stash your drugs in a lupus textbook.
it's never lupus.
who's got gallstones, and why do we care?
gallstones? - Biliary duct is dilated.
probably from a stonelodged in it. Must've caused a nasty caseof pancreatitis.
she's six. Six-year-olds don'tget gallstones.
so she didn't have pancreatitis.
your theory is an invisible gallstone?
his theory correctly predicted pancreatitis.
you might want to wait until he actually tells us his theory before you startkissing his theory's ass.
my theory is... vanishing gallstone.
she had it, and it passed. Those things travel in packs.
the rest of them are probably hiding out in her gall bladder. Do an ultrasound.
if I'm right, we'll take out the organ so we can analyzethe stones.
I wasn't kissing his ass.
it must've just looked that way from our angle.
you on your knees, House bending over. - He predicted the pancreatitis.
it's his dad's fault. - My dad was an ass.
but you did everything he wanted you to, and in return you got everything you wanted.
Yeah, It's that simple.
the strategy worked. Dad got him a cushy job. Paid for his cushy life.
cut me out of hisushy will.
I told you. It's just his nature. Poor guy's hard wired to kiss ass.
house was right. Gallstones.
I didn't know a kid could get gallstones.
it's unusual. That's why we need to see what's causing it.
we'd like to remove Alice's gallbladder and analyze the stones.
sure. - No.
just 'causeI said sure? - I am capable of my own thoughts.
it's a simple procedure. The gallbladderisn't essential
if the doctor thinks we should do it, we should do it, Edie.
you think maybe we should get a second opinion before we start removingour child's organs?
that's an effective use of taxpayers' money.
I'm actually off this week. - I'm guessing you don't have a family.
most people have enough going on in their lives that they don't have topersonalize every slight.
this isn't personal. Not anymore.
my head of oncology had to shut down.
my entire staff are afraid to make a move without covering their ass.
I think you're angry at the wrong person.
you think Dr. Wilson deserved to have his assets seized?
his entire practice ruined? - No.
so you just don't care?
this is how I get what I want.
I put pressure on people.
and if it doesn't work on Wilson, it'll work on you.
you punish the innocent.
none of you are innocent. Not one of you.
not one of you has told me the truth. About Dr. House.
the pills allow him to cope with the pain.
no, the pills distort reality. He is an addict.
he's not out robbinga liquor store or-- - No, he's treating people.
he needs to finda different way to cope before he kills somebody.
if he hasn'tdone that already.
if you're right, he has a medical problem.
it should be dealt with by doctors, not by
well, it's not being dealt with by doctors. Doctors are covering it up.
the whole point of the criminal justice system is to make things right when everything else fails.
with all due respect...You have failed.
sorry. Didn't know you wanted your kid dead.
although, for a couple of g's I could still make it happen.
who the hell are you?
I am complete stranger who apparently cares more about whether your kid dies than you do.
you're Dr. House. - You've seen my stage show.
she's not dying. She has pancreatitis.
once you've treated that, I'm taking her home.
and do what, burn sage? I want you to do the surgery.
my father had gallstones. They were totally harmless.
Alice had one bad one, but it passed. For all we know this is over.
and for all we know she could get sick again tomorrow.
then I'll take her to her pediatrician. She's six, Rob.
she shouldn't have unnecessary surgery.
or a moron for a mom, but what can you do?
you're the doctor. I'm the mother.
I out rank you. Live with iT.
I've read the file. You've got 15 minutes.
it's like people like this who killed copernicus.
Galileo. - Either way.
and they just locked Galileo up.
they killed his spirit. Nobody likes a showoff.
luckily, Alice Hartmannhas a dad who's willing to see reason.
reason as defined by slavishly deferring to you.
their doctor.
your honor, I've had no opportunity to consult my attorney.
there's no time.
all I want is a second opinion before-- - no time!
your testimony is their child will die if I don't grant this motion right now.
am I under oath? - Let's say yes.
my testimony is that this child might die if you don't grantthis motion right now.
literally no timefor a second opinion.
wouldn't be as good as the first opinion.
Dr. Cuddy, what do you think?
she's not a specialist in this area. Her opinion is worthless.
Dr. Cuddy, what doyou think of Dr. House? Is he as big a jerk as I think he is?
bigger. But he knows what he's talking about.
got a page. - She's complaining about her stitches.
nurse just said that's completely normal.
did you get the test results for the gallstones? - Any minute now.
no time for a second opinion but the test takes
my skin hurts.
I know I no longer have the right to demand it, but could you please take a look?
sure.
she's pissed, now she's just looking for things to go wrong.
you're right, I'm so petty I hope she dies so it vindicates my opinion.
I didn't mean that, sweetie. Mommy was being sarcastic.
she's a few years away from grasping sarcasm, don't you think?
guys.
I already gave you that number.
simple surgical procedure turns a little girl into the English patient. What gives?
must be allergic to something we used in the surgery.
this is my office. I'm talking.
there are people here who work for me.
they're not listening. Explain this to me.
Tritter froze my account.
they're checking theirs. I'm on hold with a lawyer.
call Wilson's lawyer. He'll tell you exactly how and why you're screwed.
this kid has no history of allergies. - You've gotta talk to Tritter.
you gotta make this go away.
Yeah, great plan. The man's obviously open to reason.
well, here's the plan. We do nothing.
we wile away the time diagnosing the patient.
the stones were calcium bilirubinante, pigment stones，which are non-conclusive.
kid presented with low-gradefever, mild anemia.
that plus the stones indicate bacterial infection.
bacterial infections don't cause a vesicular rash.
and doing nothing is not a plan. It's specifically a lack of a plan.
we cut into her belly. Bad boys escape.
they swarm over, colonize the wounds, and...
Ka-plow! Vesicular rash.
allergic reaction is 100% more likely with or without a history.
fever and anemia could've been symptoms of pancreatitis.
Hello?
thank you for your help.
they froze my accounts. - Thank you for your help?
it's not her fault. - He hasn't gotten to mine yet.
I'm gonna withdraw and much as I can as fast as I can. Lunch is on me.
do a scratch test. Check for allergies.
when it comes up negative, startbroad-spectrum antibiotics.
bullies bully. They don't get a reaction, they lose interest.
now go do what I ask before I stick your heads in toilets.
how'd otter get here? - Daddy got him last night.
it was at the dry cleaner. They close at 6: 00. How'd you get it?
I drove over there.
I knocked for about ten minutes. And then I begged.
how about some ice cream for when this is through?
my tummy hurts. - Ginger ale?
yeah?
I'll take over. - Be right back.
he's already been really good at the big romantic gestures, but ask him to do the dishes or show up for a meal on time or drive her-- - almost done here.
what are you doing here? - I work here.
passively-aggressively you gave up your practice.
I have clinic hours.
now, you're passively-aggressively spreading peanut butter with a big sign around your neck saying, "Wilson doesn't have enough cash for the cafeteria."
you know, before Lenny Bruce died of a drug overdose...
if you're gonna confront me with everyone who ever abused narcotics,
I think I'm gonna have to get something to read...
he was arrested on obscenity charges.
he went through a series of arrests and trials because he just couldn't stop challenging the police.
he became obsessed with his own legal problems.
and his act turned into long, humorless rants about fascist cops and the violation of his rights.
I get it, I get it. I need to change my nightclub act. You think more props?
house, scratch testis getting results. A lot of results.
how could she be allergic to everything? - She can't be.
it has to be an infection.
you see a positive allergy test and decide it's infection?
the bacteria got into the scratches in her back.
infections radiate. That shape of this isn't
eat this. - I don't feel like eating.
it'll make you better.
a sandwich? - Magic sandwich.
there's no such thing-- - just take a damn bite, okay, kid?
amazing how she didn't go into anaphylactic shock.
that's diagnostical lyridiculous.
right, she's allergic to everything except peanuts.
if she is allergic, antibiotics could cause a massive systemic reaction.
if she's allergic, but she's not.
chase, you're right.
the shape indicates allergy. The tests indicate allergy.
just because she's not allergic to peanuts doesn't mean she's not allergic to lidocane or
chase, hang the bag!
you can growa backbone tomorrow.
no, I'm not giving my daughter drugs that could shuther system down.
you know what else shuts down systems? Death.
sorry. I can't let you do this.
luckily, Alice Hartmann has a mom who is willing to see reason.
you were in here yesterday telling me her father's guardianship was best for her.
I honestly figured I'd get a different judge today.
you agree with Dr. House now.
now my kidactually is sick. - She was sick yesterday.
her pediatrician doesn't know what's wrong with her, says Dr. House is the best.
she loses guardianship. All of a sudden, House is a hero.
it's got nothing to dowith me deciding
Hey, zip it! I've heard enough.
this lawyering thing is easy. - You shut up too.
arguing over every decision is a waste of her time and mine.
since her parents can'tor won't agree,
I'm awarding temporaryguardianship to a doctor who will place the health of the child above all else.
I don't think dr. Houseis capable
Dr. Cuddy. - Yes, your honor.
no, I was finishingmy sentence.
the kid's all yours.
3: 00. Give me the pills.
I don't even know this kid. How am I supposed to decide what's best for her?
fine, I'll choose.
I'm gonna side with the angry doctor's opinion. Give me my pills.
we're not gonna gobroad-spectrum.
if there's any chancethat she's allergic
there is no chance. - Of course there's a chance.
I'm appealing. - No, you're not.
if you think it's bacterial, pick one antibiotic.
not gonna be enough. We need to go broad-spectrum.
it kills bugs. That's what you want.
we'll go with metronidazole.
you don't have to testify he's broken any laws.
though i'm sure you could.
just how many pills he takes in a day.
because I'm fairly confident I can prove that didn't, uh, have that many legitimate prescriptions.
I really hope no one dies while I'm sitting here not talking to you.
I--I had a, uh--I had a buddy at trenton pddo some digging.
your brother locked up for drugs.
your own flesh and blood, and you don't even visit.
but your boss practices medicine on drugs, time to start lying to the cops.
if I run out for coffee, will I get back before you make your point?
you, um, you testify...
I can make sure that Marcus goes free on parole in less than two months.
my brother and I...
we grew up in the same home.
but... I made something of myself.
he didn't.
Dr. Foreman, the way you talk, you'd think you never committed any crimes yourself.
you and Dr. House. You are both cold bastards.
you don't give a damn about your brother, and you can't stand House.
but I do expect you to take this deal because you hate hypocrisy more.
house has had a thousand chances. You had two chances.
why is your brother stuck at one?
well, if she was allergic to this antibiotic, we would've seen it by now.
I think we are out of the woods as far as that goes.
guess they occasionally get one right.
you're gonna be glib about this?
you almost killed her. - I made a choice.
the same choice you made yesterday. Only when I make it, I'm an imbecile.
every decision you have made has been wrong.
when this over, I'm suing for sole custody.
because I trusted doctors when you didn't?
because it's not just about the past two days.
like you have the hotline on what's best for Alice. She loves me.
she never does her homework when she's with you. She never brushes her hair
her heart's racing. Pressure's rising. The two of you, get out.
I'm her mother. You can't just
you fight. She has an anxiety attack.
the two of you are making her worse. Get out and don't come back.
how's the kid doing?
much better as of about two hours ago. You got any moneyfor lunch?
if you like parsley and croutons.
Tritter finally froze my accounts. - Really?
you surprised? Why wouldn't he?
well, I figured if he wassingling you out, you must've done something different.
what, like talking?
Yeah, and now that he's frozen your accounts, you probably will. You need the cash, right?
he doesn't freeze my accounts, I'm guilty. He does freeze my accounts, I'm guilty.
is Alice having some procedure done?
she's fine. She's resting. - Where?
in her room, where you're not supposed to
I was just at the window. There's no one in there.
her backpack wasn't there either.
you don't think her father could've
call security.
get a gurney. - She's stiff. She can't move.
I don't know what happened. I mean, she seemed fine.
help her, please.
on the plus side, she could medal in luge.
muscle rigidity is almost exclusively neurological.
Neuroaxonal dystrophy. She's the right age.
except that her liver's starting to shut down.
no dystrophy would-- - metronidazole. Great idea.
let's not go broad-spectrum. Let's not take any chances of actually curing her.
house, can you focus on the case? - No! Because I'm in pain.
because you think that compromise is the answer to everything.
I need more pills.
muscle rigidity plus liver involvement means Wilson'S.
no, no corneal ring. No mental changes.
then what?
I need more pills! - No, you are ona reasonable
what the hell does"reasonable" mean?
keep it quiet. Her B. P.Reacts to stress, and yelling is not
if you think that I'm not in pain, then don't give me anything.
keep me away from the aspirin.
but if I'm ina buttload of pain, I need a buttload of pills.
fine. You need more pills. You're not getting them.
you can have all the aspirin you want.
I say we draw straws. Loser drives down to trenton, scores him an eight-ball.
which one of you twogave her an aspirin? - What?
her symptomsfit reye's syndrome, which doesn't make any senseunless she took aspirin.
rob? - No way. She's a kid.
I've read the 800warning labels.
I'm not even angry. I just want her to be okay.
she's lying. She's angry. Because you kidnapped her kid.
she'll be angrier if the kid dies. - I didn't.
one aspirin combined with a pre-existing infection is all it takes to set off an attack.
I'm not lying.
well, sure, you've certainly earned our trust.
where was Alice the night before she came in?
with me. Well, at my House.
I went out. She stayed with a babysitter.
where were you? - None of your business.
you hired someone that might've poisoned our daughter.
she's 15. She's very responsible.
is she a 15-year-old pharmacist?
or just some kid from down the street who needed 20 bucks for lip gloss and coupleof tiger beats?
put your kid oncharcoal hemoperfusion.
shouldn't we see what the babysitter has to say?
I know what she's gonna say. She's gonna lie to save her business.
I need more pills.
we are gonna use this machine to clean your blood.
it goes out of you and through a filter like the filter in a fish tank.
it's kind of coolactually.
I'm scared.
it won't hurt.
it takes a while, so it'll be boring. But it won't hurt.
it's gonna makeyou better.
they hate each other, don't they? We're never gonna be together again.
well, you never know.
you gonna break out the rubber hoses, the bright lights?
I'm not gonna testify just because I have to borrow lunch money.
I know. Women don't give up guys that they're in love with.
I'm not in love with House.
the guy is unhinged and unethical.
does what he wants with no concern for others.
but you stand by him.
it can't just be loyalty and respect. - No.
I'm girl, so i must be in love with him.
not because you're a girl.
because ten years ago you got an "a" in calculus until you ratted yourself out.
showed your professor a mistake he missed.
because you marrieda man-- - don't go there.
you used to be someone who did the right thing.
house has changed you do you think it's all been for the better?
how's it going? - Boring.
told you. - So far, so good.
just like five minutes ago, ten minutes before that.
what's the matter?
she must've thrown a clot.
let's get her out of here. I'll call the O. R.
you said it wouldn't hurt!
found it. - She's burning up.
give me a sec. - Foreman, she is on fire.
almost there.
get me some cooling blankets now. - Right away.
every time we touch this kid, something goes wrong.
bad mojo is not a diagnosis.
you really had to flash your private stash in front of me?
you find it easier to lie for me if it's more subtle?
fine.
your told your associates thatI had frozen your accounts.
Yes. - Smart lie.
you figured they'd think there was a reason that you'd been singled out.
like that you had agreed to testify against House.
Yeah, I assume that's why you did it.
you have a reputationas a bit of an opportunist.
you already gave your boss up once from what I've heard.
to save my job. He goes down now, I lose my job.
you lose your job, you find another one.
you get fired...
chances don't look so hot.
why would he fire to me? - Because you rolled on him.
I haven't rolled on him. - I think you will.
and he's gonna think you already did.
as far as he knows, my accounts are frozen just like everyone else's.
in 24 hours, all three of you will have access to your accounts again.
why would you
see, I was looking at this as an outsider, I would say it was because detective Tritter had what appeared to be a very pleasant lunch with Dr. Chase.
Yeah.
the two of them appeared to be working together.
how the hell are there no ice packs in the O. R?
clot's out. Ice packs aren't going to hold her for long. Where are the blankets?
in the E. R. They're dealing with a four-car collision.
we need to coo lthis kid downbefore her brain melts.
what are you doing?
she got a major dose of heparin to thin her blood for the procedure.
could've induced thrombocytopenia.
that's unlikely. The charcoal would've absorbeda lot of the heparin.
she's been anemic. Could be a primary blood disorder.
or we never cured the infection. - Are you saying she never had reye's?
we just put that little girl through excruciating pain.
the pain wasn't House's fault.
even if the clot wasa reaction to what we gave her we still had
I don't need you to covermy ass!
what I need is my vicodin!
two pills every six hours. Like I'm on an allowance.
she's a given a cop leverage over medical decisions.
what the hell? Why don't we get a plumberin here, ask his opinion?
Hey, Cuddy, you know any rodeo clowns who can weigh in
where the hell is she?
look at her arm.
I told you it was an infection.
we fixed the infection. - Well, apparently not.
I asked you for broad-spectrum. You put her on the bare minimum.
it's a good thing you failed to become a mom because you suck at it.
what's good about this rash?
good guesses, but no.
it's on parts of her body that we haven't touched.
she's got a fever of 103. She's in and out of consciousness.
but it's not a reaction to anything we did.
her mojois off the table. Which means?
Oh, so close!
means that thanks to cuddy's candy-ass approach broad-spectrum antibioticsare no longer an option.
this thing has grown horns and fangs.
we gotta figure out what species it is.
go in with a spear to the heart.
okay, you guys are sulking.
I don't really care why, but apparently I can't do my job without finding out.
Tritter released our bank accounts. - Horrible, horrible news.
wow, I'm glad we didn't let that fester.
if she did have reye's, then it could be varicella. They're associated.
he released our money. You do know what that means.
the correct question is"how could it be varicella given that she's not itchy"?
Rickettisal pox causesrash, fever, and muslepain. - Pain, not paralysis.
rocky mountain spotted fever on the other hand. Rash, fever, anemia, paralysis.
and I didn't sayanything to tritter. - Neither did I.
maybe he wants us to think that one of us talked.
it worked. - You were with him.
we were all with him. - We weren't laughing with him.
maybe he just gave up.
start the kid on chloramphenicol for rocky mountain spotted fever.
can we talk? - Nope.
I really thinkeither you screwed meand you want absolution, or you didn't and you want applause.
either way I'm not interested.
busy.
you okay? - Yeah, sure.
what I meant by"are you okay"? Is what the hell did House do?
nothing. - What did he say?
I've seen House be rude a thousand times, usually to achieve something.
I have never seen him be mean just because he can.
Seriously?
what did he say? - Nothing. Doesn't matter.
well, I've seen House be rude to you a thousand times, but I've never seen it get to you.
people think House has no inner censor.
but the fact is he holds himself back, because when he wants to hurt, he knows just where to poke a sharp stick.
I have been trying to get pregnant, and House knew.
he told me I wouldf ail as a mother.
and you're this upset because you think he's right?
I've had three separate implantations.
the first two never took. The last one I lost.
I'm sorry. You didn't fail. Those where physical events.
a little girl is... scared and in pain.
I was awkward, terrified of doing the wrong thing.
that's normal. That's
I didn't hug her.
I didn't even reach outand hold her hand.
I told her it was gonna be okay.
she needed reassurance.
I told her her folks might get back together.
when I see people with their kids, it's so natural.
it's like they have an instruction book imprinted on their genes.
maybe I just didn'tget a copy.
maybe my wanting to be a motheris like a tone deaf person wanting to sing opera - or a paraplegicwho wants to-- - whoa, whoa, whoa.
well, I see what you mean about House pokingin the right spot.
chloramphenicol isn't working.
what dose did you give her? - Yeah, maybe Chase screwed up.
we always end up there. Just getting a jump on it.
I doubled her up.
the infection's morphed.
it's moved into her muscle sheath. - Necrotizing faciitis?
that's impervious to drugs.
the only treatment... is to cut away the infected area.
so we amputate. - Arm and leg?
we can't cut a six-year-old kid in half without a confirmed diagnosis.
moves too quicklyand we waited too long. We don't have timefor a culture.
we can at least observe herfor a few hours. Confirm the rashis spreading.
it spreads, she dies.
you're talking about crippling her.
we're not even certain this was an infection.
right! She's six! She's cute! She can't have flesh-eating bacteria!
it's just wrong! Let's cure her with sunshine and puppies.
cute kids die of illnesses. Innocent doctors go to jail.
and it because cowards like you won't stand up and do what's required.
you can sit around and moan about who's the bigger weakling.
I'm gonna go do my job.
what kind of quality of life will she have without
great thing about life.
it's got qualities.
and if we can't agree?
I don't know.
he's yelled at us before.
because he thought our theories were dumb. Not because our theories were sending him to jail.
he's going through withdrawal. Could be causing mild paranoia.
it'll pass, we just have to suffer thought.
we never ruled out allergy.
we gave her drugs. She had no negative reaction.
we cut open her belly. She got a rash on her belly.
we did a scratch teston her back. She got a rash on her back.
I know House ruled out mojo, but it can't be a coincidence
too late to be playing differential games, isn't it?
get that thing away from me. I don't want to get burned.
laser pointers don't burn you, genius.
skin, no. Retina, yes.
you don't trust my aim?
maybe you should cover any sensitive
he was wrong about the puppies.
house, you gotta stop the surgery.
she doesn't have necrotizing faciitis. - Oh, good.
she's got erythropoieticprotoporphyria. She's allergic to light.
it's genetic, either parent could've carried it.
I know what it is. Infection fits better.
she gets worse every time she goes under surgical lights.
dad takes her outside-- - liver's shot too.
she swallow a flashlight? - Stop the surgery.
get the hell out of my way. - No, I'm--unh!
light damagesthe blood cells.
the damaged blood cells contain protoporphyrin.
the protoporphyrinbuilds up in the liver.
that's why the liver'sshutting down.
stop.
how can she be allergic to light? She's never had thisproblem before.
the negative reactionstarts at birth.
it reaches critical massaround this age.
her blood cells create chemicals in reaction to light.
when they reach the liver, it tries to filter out the bad cells.
the chemicals damage the liver, and one byproductis gallstones.
so she'll just keep getting worse?
EP can be managed. We'll give her beta-carotene.
she's gonna need special light bulbs and filters on the windows.
she's probably gonna need to be home schooled.
her life will becomplicated, but she will live.
how do you getsomething like this?
it's genetic. So one of us...
both of youmust be carriers.
she's gonna want to see you when she wakes up. So...
don't screw it up.
so, what's new?
house missed one. - That's happened before.
he nearly maimed a little girl. I got it right.
and I told him, and it didn't matter.
chase, you solved one. You helped a patient. That better be enough for you.
Beckett was gonna call his play"waiting for House's approval"but decided it was too grim.
trust me. I'm not waiting anymore.
I'm gonna need 30 pieces of silver.
all right, stand here.
you're just tall enough.
I--I don't--I don't think I am.
it just goes around.
there's nothingto be scared of, all right?
I didn't say I was scared.
it'll be fun. Come on.
when I was a kid, this was my favorite thing ever.
I don't like rides.
all right, all right. I just--I though tit'd be fun.
I shouldn't be making you do this.
uh...Let's go home. We can have fun at home.
no, daddy, wait.
the ride does look like fun.
Oh, this is awesome!
Alice, are you all right?
honey, you all right?
Alice! Alice, are you okay?
nothing happened. - something happened.
it was a little kiddie ride. - She hates those rides.
I don't understand why you insist on making
okay, I appreciate the fullness of your answers, but I just wanted to know if she had any historyof abdominal problems.
no. - No.
the admitting doctornoted no family history of
I have an aunt with Crohn's disease.
you didn't mention that? - I--I forgot what it was called.
your aunt has got a million things wrong with her.
if you paid attention for five minutes.
I doubt it's crohn'S. She has none of the other systems.
you're alone with her for eight hours, she ends up in the hospital.
I'm wondering if we can focus on answering the questions, Mrs. Hartmann.
I'm not Mrs. Hartmann. We're divorced.
I suspected.
and your pasgenerosity made me think of you.
we're half a million dollars from our goal.
of course, this is a naming opportunityfor your foundation.
is--is there a problem?
there's somethingon your face.
it's, uh--ahem.
excuse me.
Oh! - Oh, god.
I'm sitting in there hoping it's a sniper because at then the sociopa thisn't my employee.
this baby won me second place in the clinic's weekly "weirdest thing pulled out of an orifice" contest.
I am this close to putting a new lab in oncology.
you do not want to know what came in first.
house. - Rhymes with "fucchini."
give me his pills.
Where's my prescription? - No more free floating prescriptions.
princeton pd has already forced wilson to shut down.
a cop says boo, Wilson shuts down.
every doctor in this place is afraid to make a move without covering his ass.
do you think maybe you're shouting at the wrong person?
Tritter's obviously out to get me. He doesn't care
your forged prescriptions! - Allegedly.
your pain has become my pain.
from now on you get reasonable dosesat reasonable times.
but I hurt in an unreasonable way.
then dip into your secret stash. - Tritter took it.
then move onto your secret secret stash. - I ran out.
then move onto your secret secret secret stash.
parents say she's not on any med.
if the pancreatitis wasn't set off by drugs, and she hasn't been sick, that leaves traumaor some kind of structural defect. Put up the ct.
what's that density there? - Shadow. Looks normal to me.
we got a referral from-- - excuse me.
you stash your drugs in a lupus textbook.
it's never lupus.
who's got gallstones, and why do we care?
gallstones? - Biliary duct is dilated.
probably from a stonelodged in it. Must've caused a nasty caseof pancreatitis.
she's six. Six-year-olds don'tget gallstones.
so she didn't have pancreatitis.
your theory is an invisible gallstone?
his theory correctly predicted pancreatitis.
you might want to wait until he actually tells us his theory before you startkissing his theory's ass.
my theory is... vanishing gallstone.
she had it, and it passed. Those things travel in packs.
the rest of them are probably hiding out in her gall bladder. Do an ultrasound.
if I'm right, we'll take out the organ so we can analyzethe stones.
I wasn't kissing his ass.
it must've just looked that way from our angle.
you on your knees, House bending over. - He predicted the pancreatitis.
it's his dad's fault. - My dad was an ass.
but you did everything he wanted you to, and in return you got everything you wanted.
Yeah, It's that simple.
the strategy worked. Dad got him a cushy job. Paid for his cushy life.
cut me out of hisushy will.
I told you. It's just his nature. Poor guy's hard wired to kiss ass.
house was right. Gallstones.
I didn't know a kid could get gallstones.
it's unusual. That's why we need to see what's causing it.
we'd like to remove Alice's gallbladder and analyze the stones.
sure. - No.
just 'causeI said sure? - I am capable of my own thoughts.
it's a simple procedure. The gallbladderisn't essential
if the doctor thinks we should do it, we should do it, Edie.
you think maybe we should get a second opinion before we start removingour child's organs?
that's an effective use of taxpayers' money.
I'm actually off this week. - I'm guessing you don't have a family.
most people have enough going on in their lives that they don't have topersonalize every slight.
this isn't personal. Not anymore.
my head of oncology had to shut down.
my entire staff are afraid to make a move without covering their ass.
I think you're angry at the wrong person.
you think Dr. Wilson deserved to have his assets seized?
his entire practice ruined? - No.
so you just don't care?
this is how I get what I want.
I put pressure on people.
and if it doesn't work on Wilson, it'll work on you.
you punish the innocent.
none of you are innocent. Not one of you.
not one of you has told me the truth. About Dr. House.
the pills allow him to cope with the pain.
no, the pills distort reality. He is an addict.
he's not out robbinga liquor store or-- - No, he's treating people.
he needs to finda different way to cope before he kills somebody.
if he hasn'tdone that already.
if you're right, he has a medical problem.
it should be dealt with by doctors, not by
well, it's not being dealt with by doctors. Doctors are covering it up.
the whole point of the criminal justice system is to make things right when everything else fails.
with all due respect...You have failed.
sorry. Didn't know you wanted your kid dead.
although, for a couple of g's I could still make it happen.
who the hell are you?
I am complete stranger who apparently cares more about whether your kid dies than you do.
you're Dr. House. - You've seen my stage show.
she's not dying. She has pancreatitis.
once you've treated that, I'm taking her home.
and do what, burn sage? I want you to do the surgery.
my father had gallstones. They were totally harmless.
Alice had one bad one, but it passed. For all we know this is over.
and for all we know she could get sick again tomorrow.
then I'll take her to her pediatrician. She's six, Rob.
she shouldn't have unnecessary surgery.
or a moron for a mom, but what can you do?
you're the doctor. I'm the mother.
I out rank you. Live with iT.
I've read the file. You've got 15 minutes.
it's like people like this who killed copernicus.
Galileo. - Either way.
and they just locked Galileo up.
they killed his spirit. Nobody likes a showoff.
luckily, Alice Hartmannhas a dad who's willing to see reason.
reason as defined by slavishly deferring to you.
their doctor.
your honor, I've had no opportunity to consult my attorney.
there's no time.
all I want is a second opinion before-- - no time!
your testimony is their child will die if I don't grant this motion right now.
am I under oath? - Let's say yes.
my testimony is that this child might die if you don't grantthis motion right now.
literally no timefor a second opinion.
wouldn't be as good as the first opinion.
Dr. Cuddy, what do you think?
she's not a specialist in this area. Her opinion is worthless.
Dr. Cuddy, what doyou think of Dr. House? Is he as big a jerk as I think he is?
bigger. But he knows what he's talking about.
got a page. - She's complaining about her stitches.
nurse just said that's completely normal.
did you get the test results for the gallstones? - Any minute now.
no time for a second opinion but the test takes
my skin hurts.
I know I no longer have the right to demand it, but could you please take a look?
sure.
she's pissed, now she's just looking for things to go wrong.
you're right, I'm so petty I hope she dies so it vindicates my opinion.
I didn't mean that, sweetie. Mommy was being sarcastic.
she's a few years away from grasping sarcasm, don't you think?
guys.
I already gave you that number.
simple surgical procedure turns a little girl into the English patient. What gives?
must be allergic to something we used in the surgery.
this is my office. I'm talking.
there are people here who work for me.
they're not listening. Explain this to me.
Tritter froze my account.
they're checking theirs. I'm on hold with a lawyer.
call Wilson's lawyer. He'll tell you exactly how and why you're screwed.
this kid has no history of allergies. - You've gotta talk to Tritter.
you gotta make this go away.
Yeah, great plan. The man's obviously open to reason.
well, here's the plan. We do nothing.
we wile away the time diagnosing the patient.
the stones were calcium bilirubinante, pigment stones，which are non-conclusive.
kid presented with low-gradefever, mild anemia.
that plus the stones indicate bacterial infection.
bacterial infections don't cause a vesicular rash.
and doing nothing is not a plan. It's specifically a lack of a plan.
we cut into her belly. Bad boys escape.
they swarm over, colonize the wounds, and...
Ka-plow! Vesicular rash.
allergic reaction is 100% more likely with or without a history.
fever and anemia could've been symptoms of pancreatitis.
Hello?
thank you for your help.
they froze my accounts. - Thank you for your help?
it's not her fault. - He hasn't gotten to mine yet.
I'm gonna withdraw and much as I can as fast as I can. Lunch is on me.
do a scratch test. Check for allergies.
when it comes up negative, startbroad-spectrum antibiotics.
bullies bully. They don't get a reaction, they lose interest.
now go do what I ask before I stick your heads in toilets.
how'd otter get here? - Daddy got him last night.
it was at the dry cleaner. They close at 6: 00. How'd you get it?
I drove over there.
I knocked for about ten minutes. And then I begged.
how about some ice cream for when this is through?
my tummy hurts. - Ginger ale?
yeah?
I'll take over. - Be right back.
he's already been really good at the big romantic gestures, but ask him to do the dishes or show up for a meal on time or drive her-- - almost done here.
what are you doing here? - I work here.
passively-aggressively you gave up your practice.
I have clinic hours.
now, you're passively-aggressively spreading peanut butter with a big sign around your neck saying, "Wilson doesn't have enough cash for the cafeteria."
you know, before Lenny Bruce died of a drug overdose...
if you're gonna confront me with everyone who ever abused narcotics,
I think I'm gonna have to get something to read...
he was arrested on obscenity charges.
he went through a series of arrests and trials because he just couldn't stop challenging the police.
he became obsessed with his own legal problems.
and his act turned into long, humorless rants about fascist cops and the violation of his rights.
I get it, I get it. I need to change my nightclub act. You think more props?
house, scratch testis getting results. A lot of results.
how could she be allergic to everything? - She can't be.
it has to be an infection.
you see a positive allergy test and decide it's infection?
the bacteria got into the scratches in her back.
infections radiate. That shape of this isn't
eat this. - I don't feel like eating.
it'll make you better.
a sandwich? - Magic sandwich.
there's no such thing-- - just take a damn bite, okay, kid?
amazing how she didn't go into anaphylactic shock.
that's diagnostical lyridiculous.
right, she's allergic to everything except peanuts.
if she is allergic, antibiotics could cause a massive systemic reaction.
if she's allergic, but she's not.
chase, you're right.
the shape indicates allergy. The tests indicate allergy.
just because she's not allergic to peanuts doesn't mean she's not allergic to lidocane or
chase, hang the bag!
you can growa backbone tomorrow.
no, I'm not giving my daughter drugs that could shuther system down.
you know what else shuts down systems? Death.
sorry. I can't let you do this.
luckily, Alice Hartmann has a mom who is willing to see reason.
you were in here yesterday telling me her father's guardianship was best for her.
I honestly figured I'd get a different judge today.
you agree with Dr. House now.
now my kidactually is sick. - She was sick yesterday.
her pediatrician doesn't know what's wrong with her, says Dr. House is the best.
she loses guardianship. All of a sudden, House is a hero.
it's got nothing to dowith me deciding
Hey, zip it! I've heard enough.
this lawyering thing is easy. - You shut up too.
arguing over every decision is a waste of her time and mine.
since her parents can'tor won't agree,
I'm awarding temporaryguardianship to a doctor who will place the health of the child above all else.
I don't think dr. Houseis capable
Dr. Cuddy. - Yes, your honor.
no, I was finishingmy sentence.
the kid's all yours.
3: 00. Give me the pills.
I don't even know this kid. How am I supposed to decide what's best for her?
fine, I'll choose.
I'm gonna side with the angry doctor's opinion. Give me my pills.
we're not gonna gobroad-spectrum.
if there's any chancethat she's allergic
there is no chance. - Of course there's a chance.
I'm appealing. - No, you're not.
if you think it's bacterial, pick one antibiotic.
not gonna be enough. We need to go broad-spectrum.
it kills bugs. That's what you want.
we'll go with metronidazole.
you don't have to testify he's broken any laws.
though i'm sure you could.
just how many pills he takes in a day.
because I'm fairly confident I can prove that didn't, uh, have that many legitimate prescriptions.
I really hope no one dies while I'm sitting here not talking to you.
I--I had a, uh--I had a buddy at trenton pddo some digging.
your brother locked up for drugs.
your own flesh and blood, and you don't even visit.
but your boss practices medicine on drugs, time to start lying to the cops.
if I run out for coffee, will I get back before you make your point?
you, um, you testify...
I can make sure that Marcus goes free on parole in less than two months.
my brother and I...
we grew up in the same home.
but... I made something of myself.
he didn't.
Dr. Foreman, the way you talk, you'd think you never committed any crimes yourself.
you and Dr. House. You are both cold bastards.
you don't give a damn about your brother, and you can't stand House.
but I do expect you to take this deal because you hate hypocrisy more.
house has had a thousand chances. You had two chances.
why is your brother stuck at one?
well, if she was allergic to this antibiotic, we would've seen it by now.
I think we are out of the woods as far as that goes.
guess they occasionally get one right.
you're gonna be glib about this?
you almost killed her. - I made a choice.
the same choice you made yesterday. Only when I make it, I'm an imbecile.
every decision you have made has been wrong.
when this over, I'm suing for sole custody.
because I trusted doctors when you didn't?
because it's not just about the past two days.
like you have the hotline on what's best for Alice. She loves me.
she never does her homework when she's with you. She never brushes her hair
her heart's racing. Pressure's rising. The two of you, get out.
I'm her mother. You can't just
you fight. She has an anxiety attack.
the two of you are making her worse. Get out and don't come back.
how's the kid doing?
much better as of about two hours ago. You got any moneyfor lunch?
if you like parsley and croutons.
Tritter finally froze my accounts. - Really?
you surprised? Why wouldn't he?
well, I figured if he wassingling you out, you must've done something different.
what, like talking?
Yeah, and now that he's frozen your accounts, you probably will. You need the cash, right?
he doesn't freeze my accounts, I'm guilty. He does freeze my accounts, I'm guilty.
is Alice having some procedure done?
she's fine. She's resting. - Where?
in her room, where you're not supposed to
I was just at the window. There's no one in there.
her backpack wasn't there either.
you don't think her father could've
call security.
get a gurney. - She's stiff. She can't move.
I don't know what happened. I mean, she seemed fine.
help her, please.
on the plus side, she could medal in luge.
muscle rigidity is almost exclusively neurological.
Neuroaxonal dystrophy. She's the right age.
except that her liver's starting to shut down.
no dystrophy would-- - metronidazole. Great idea.
let's not go broad-spectrum. Let's not take any chances of actually curing her.
house, can you focus on the case? - No! Because I'm in pain.
because you think that compromise is the answer to everything.
I need more pills.
muscle rigidity plus liver involvement means Wilson'S.
no, no corneal ring. No mental changes.
then what?
I need more pills! - No, you are ona reasonable
what the hell does"reasonable" mean?
keep it quiet. Her B. P.Reacts to stress, and yelling is not
if you think that I'm not in pain, then don't give me anything.
keep me away from the aspirin.
but if I'm ina buttload of pain, I need a buttload of pills.
fine. You need more pills. You're not getting them.
you can have all the aspirin you want.
I say we draw straws. Loser drives down to trenton, scores him an eight-ball.
which one of you twogave her an aspirin? - What?
her symptomsfit reye's syndrome, which doesn't make any senseunless she took aspirin.
rob? - No way. She's a kid.
I've read the 800warning labels.
I'm not even angry. I just want her to be okay.
she's lying. She's angry. Because you kidnapped her kid.
she'll be angrier if the kid dies. - I didn't.
one aspirin combined with a pre-existing infection is all it takes to set off an attack.
I'm not lying.
well, sure, you've certainly earned our trust.
where was Alice the night before she came in?
with me. Well, at my House.
I went out. She stayed with a babysitter.
where were you? - None of your business.
you hired someone that might've poisoned our daughter.
she's 15. She's very responsible.
is she a 15-year-old pharmacist?
or just some kid from down the street who needed 20 bucks for lip gloss and coupleof tiger beats?
put your kid oncharcoal hemoperfusion.
shouldn't we see what the babysitter has to say?
I know what she's gonna say. She's gonna lie to save her business.
I need more pills.
we are gonna use this machine to clean your blood.
it goes out of you and through a filter like the filter in a fish tank.
it's kind of coolactually.
I'm scared.
it won't hurt.
it takes a while, so it'll be boring. But it won't hurt.
it's gonna makeyou better.
they hate each other, don't they? We're never gonna be together again.
well, you never know.
you gonna break out the rubber hoses, the bright lights?
I'm not gonna testify just because I have to borrow lunch money.
I know. Women don't give up guys that they're in love with.
I'm not in love with House.
the guy is unhinged and unethical.
does what he wants with no concern for others.
but you stand by him.
it can't just be loyalty and respect. - No.
I'm girl, so i must be in love with him.
not because you're a girl.
because ten years ago you got an "a" in calculus until you ratted yourself out.
showed your professor a mistake he missed.
because you marrieda man-- - don't go there.
you used to be someone who did the right thing.
house has changed you do you think it's all been for the better?
how's it going? - Boring.
told you. - So far, so good.
just like five minutes ago, ten minutes before that.
what's the matter?
she must've thrown a clot.
let's get her out of here. I'll call the O. R.
you said it wouldn't hurt!
found it. - She's burning up.
give me a sec. - Foreman, she is on fire.
almost there.
get me some cooling blankets now. - Right away.
every time we touch this kid, something goes wrong.
bad mojo is not a diagnosis.
you really had to flash your private stash in front of me?
you find it easier to lie for me if it's more subtle?
fine.
your told your associates thatI had frozen your accounts.
Yes. - Smart lie.
you figured they'd think there was a reason that you'd been singled out.
like that you had agreed to testify against House.
Yeah, I assume that's why you did it.
you have a reputationas a bit of an opportunist.
you already gave your boss up once from what I've heard.
to save my job. He goes down now, I lose my job.
you lose your job, you find another one.
you get fired...
chances don't look so hot.
why would he fire to me? - Because you rolled on him.
I haven't rolled on him. - I think you will.
and he's gonna think you already did.
as far as he knows, my accounts are frozen just like everyone else's.
in 24 hours, all three of you will have access to your accounts again.
why would you
see, I was looking at this as an outsider, I would say it was because detective Tritter had what appeared to be a very pleasant lunch with Dr. Chase.
Yeah.
the two of them appeared to be working together.
how the hell are there no ice packs in the O. R?
clot's out. Ice packs aren't going to hold her for long. Where are the blankets?
in the E. R. They're dealing with a four-car collision.
we need to coo lthis kid downbefore her brain melts.
what are you doing?
she got a major dose of heparin to thin her blood for the procedure.
could've induced thrombocytopenia.
that's unlikely. The charcoal would've absorbeda lot of the heparin.
she's been anemic. Could be a primary blood disorder.
or we never cured the infection. - Are you saying she never had reye's?
we just put that little girl through excruciating pain.
the pain wasn't House's fault.
even if the clot wasa reaction to what we gave her we still had
I don't need you to covermy ass!
what I need is my vicodin!
two pills every six hours. Like I'm on an allowance.
she's a given a cop leverage over medical decisions.
what the hell? Why don't we get a plumberin here, ask his opinion?
Hey, Cuddy, you know any rodeo clowns who can weigh in
where the hell is she?
look at her arm.
I told you it was an infection.
we fixed the infection. - Well, apparently not.
I asked you for broad-spectrum. You put her on the bare minimum.
it's a good thing you failed to become a mom because you suck at it.
what's good about this rash?
good guesses, but no.
it's on parts of her body that we haven't touched.
she's got a fever of 103. She's in and out of consciousness.
but it's not a reaction to anything we did.
her mojois off the table. Which means?
Oh, so close!
means that thanks to cuddy's candy-ass approach broad-spectrum antibioticsare no longer an option.
this thing has grown horns and fangs.
we gotta figure out what species it is.
go in with a spear to the heart.
okay, you guys are sulking.
I don't really care why, but apparently I can't do my job without finding out.
Tritter released our bank accounts. - Horrible, horrible news.
wow, I'm glad we didn't let that fester.
if she did have reye's, then it could be varicella. They're associated.
he released our money. You do know what that means.
the correct question is"how could it be varicella given that she's not itchy"?
Rickettisal pox causesrash, fever, and muslepain. - Pain, not paralysis.
rocky mountain spotted fever on the other hand. Rash, fever, anemia, paralysis.
and I didn't sayanything to tritter. - Neither did I.
maybe he wants us to think that one of us talked.
it worked. - You were with him.
we were all with him. - We weren't laughing with him.
maybe he just gave up.
start the kid on chloramphenicol for rocky mountain spotted fever.
can we talk? - Nope.
I really thinkeither you screwed meand you want absolution, or you didn't and you want applause.
either way I'm not interested.
busy.
you okay? - Yeah, sure.
what I meant by"are you okay"? Is what the hell did House do?
nothing. - What did he say?
I've seen House be rude a thousand times, usually to achieve something.
I have never seen him be mean just because he can.
Seriously?
what did he say? - Nothing. Doesn't matter.
well, I've seen House be rude to you a thousand times, but I've never seen it get to you.
people think House has no inner censor.
but the fact is he holds himself back, because when he wants to hurt, he knows just where to poke a sharp stick.
I have been trying to get pregnant, and House knew.
he told me I wouldf ail as a mother.
and you're this upset because you think he's right?
I've had three separate implantations.
the first two never took. The last one I lost.
I'm sorry. You didn't fail. Those where physical events.
a little girl is... scared and in pain.
I was awkward, terrified of doing the wrong thing.
that's normal. That's
I didn't hug her.
I didn't even reach outand hold her hand.
I told her it was gonna be okay.
she needed reassurance.
I told her her folks might get back together.
when I see people with their kids, it's so natural.
it's like they have an instruction book imprinted on their genes.
maybe I just didn'tget a copy.
maybe my wanting to be a motheris like a tone deaf person wanting to sing opera - or a paraplegicwho wants to-- - whoa, whoa, whoa.
well, I see what you mean about House pokingin the right spot.
chloramphenicol isn't working.
what dose did you give her? - Yeah, maybe Chase screwed up.
we always end up there. Just getting a jump on it.
I doubled her up.
the infection's morphed.
it's moved into her muscle sheath. - Necrotizing faciitis?
that's impervious to drugs.
the only treatment... is to cut away the infected area.
so we amputate. - Arm and leg?
we can't cut a six-year-old kid in half without a confirmed diagnosis.
moves too quicklyand we waited too long. We don't have timefor a culture.
we can at least observe herfor a few hours. Confirm the rashis spreading.
it spreads, she dies.
you're talking about crippling her.
we're not even certain this was an infection.
right! She's six! She's cute! She can't have flesh-eating bacteria!
it's just wrong! Let's cure her with sunshine and puppies.
cute kids die of illnesses. Innocent doctors go to jail.
and it because cowards like you won't stand up and do what's required.
you can sit around and moan about who's the bigger weakling.
I'm gonna go do my job.
what kind of quality of life will she have without
great thing about life.
it's got qualities.
and if we can't agree?
I don't know.
he's yelled at us before.
because he thought our theories were dumb. Not because our theories were sending him to jail.
he's going through withdrawal. Could be causing mild paranoia.
it'll pass, we just have to suffer thought.
we never ruled out allergy.
we gave her drugs. She had no negative reaction.
we cut open her belly. She got a rash on her belly.
we did a scratch teston her back. She got a rash on her back.
I know House ruled out mojo, but it can't be a coincidence
too late to be playing differential games, isn't it?
get that thing away from me. I don't want to get burned.
laser pointers don't burn you, genius.
skin, no. Retina, yes.
you don't trust my aim?
maybe you should cover any sensitive
he was wrong about the puppies.
house, you gotta stop the surgery.
she doesn't have necrotizing faciitis. - Oh, good.
she's got erythropoieticprotoporphyria. She's allergic to light.
it's genetic, either parent could've carried it.
I know what it is. Infection fits better.
she gets worse every time she goes under surgical lights.
dad takes her outside-- - liver's shot too.
she swallow a flashlight? - Stop the surgery.
get the hell out of my way. - No, I'm--unh!
light damagesthe blood cells.
the damaged blood cells contain protoporphyrin.
the protoporphyrinbuilds up in the liver.
that's why the liver'sshutting down.
stop.
how can she be allergic to light? She's never had thisproblem before.
the negative reactionstarts at birth.
it reaches critical massaround this age.
her blood cells create chemicals in reaction to light.
when they reach the liver, it tries to filter out the bad cells.
the chemicals damage the liver, and one byproductis gallstones.
so she'll just keep getting worse?
EP can be managed. We'll give her beta-carotene.
she's gonna need special light bulbs and filters on the windows.
she's probably gonna need to be home schooled.
her life will becomplicated, but she will live.
how do you getsomething like this?
it's genetic. So one of us...
both of youmust be carriers.
she's gonna want to see you when she wakes up. So...
don't screw it up.
so, what's new?
house missed one. - That's happened before.
he nearly maimed a little girl. I got it right.
and I told him, and it didn't matter.
chase, you solved one. You helped a patient. That better be enough for you.
Beckett was gonna call his play"waiting for House's approval"but decided it was too grim.
trust me. I'm not waiting anymore.
I'm gonna need 30 pieces of silver.
merry Christmas. - And a happy go to hell.
what's he doing here? Is he with you?
detective Tritter and I... we worked out a deal.
already got a lawyer. Get out of my office.
I told him I didn't write those prescriptions.
I spoke with the DA.
he agreed to two months in a rehab facility in exchange for a guilty plea.
get out of my office.
no jail time. - Right.
I should get locked up in some place I don't belong in order to avoid getting locked up in some other place I don't belong.
I got you on forgery and fraud.
enough drugs - no sanctions to the Medical Board.
and you get your car back and your bank accounts and your precious tumor-ridden patients.
I did this to help you.
next Christmas, buy me a sweater. You punched out an employee.
you nearly cut a little girl in half because you were too strung out
I was in pain!
you need to believe that I've got a problem so that your betrayal has the illusion of nobility.
but you just selfishly - - Knock it off.
look, I don't care why Dr.Wilson is doing this.
and right now, it makes no difference to you either.
you need to deal with the reality of your current situation.
you want to stand on principle, you end up in a cell.
and you end up never practicing medicine again.
so you've got two choices. Your principles or your life.
get out of my office.
the DA put a clock on the deal.
you've got three days to decide.
house! Just give me a minute.
you're afraid of the pain. - You're not?
you can still have pain meds in rehab.
tramadol, gabapentin - - Those don't work.
they will once you're weaned off the Vicodin.
look, there's Jesus. Better go tell the romans.
fine, run to Cuddy.
you don't think she's gonna support me on this?
well, the stitches are healing nicely. There's no sign of infection.
whoa.
sorry.
just need her for a tiny moment. Small favor.
pills.
who's the wit? - Doctor.
don't worry. I'll be firing him soon.
wait in my office.
incision looks just big enough for a chest tube. Collapsed lung?
someone mistake you for a pinata?
delightful. Usually we just get the elf jokes this time of year.
no one trauma. Negative PPD.
what flavor dwarfs are you guys?
my daughter and I both have cartilage hair hypoplasia.
think you can make a pun out of that?
Yes, but I don't want to be insensitive.
she's got a bit of a short fuse, doesn't she?
it's a bleb. Wait in my office.
Bleb's not a diagnosis. It's an evasion.
we'll schedule an MRI to make sure.
but a certain number of these cases are idiopathic.
let me translate that into talking for you guys.
means Dr.Cuddy's got no idea why your daughter's lung suddenly popped like a balloon.
you think you do?
give me her chart. And my pills.
Santa needs us.
did you get that looked at?
I'm fine. - Great.
I just admitted a cartilage hair hypoplasia dwarf.
15 years old - - what are you gonna do?
I thought I'd get your theories, mock them, then embrace my own. The usual.
Wilson told us he ratted.
your choice of verb, I take it.
it's appropriate. He betrayed you. And you should take the deal.
unexplained lung collapse and anemia. Cuddy thinks it's idiopathic.
"cuddy" and "idiop" being the relevant parts of that sentence.
well, I'd say TB, but Cuddy's already ruled it out.
then you'd be just as big an "idiop" as her. Don't you people know your dwarves?
there are over 200 varieties of dwarfism, each with different medical complications.
you can't expect us to be intimately familiar with all of them.
the sick dwarves sure expect you to. - Cartilage hair hypoplasia.
they have compromises immune systems. - Gold star for Cameron.
for extra credit, explain to the special needs section the class why our patient's negative TB test is irrelevant.
a PPD involves planting a fragment of TB under the skin to see if the immune system recognizes it.
because of a compromised immune system, our patient could have TB but not recognize it.
the little people love you.
let's go see a dwarf about a gallium scan.
gallium is a radio active isotope.
it travels through your veins allowing us to see any bright spots that might indicate infection.
I'm 4'1. That's 1.5 canes in metric.
you don't look a day over four feet.
I saw in the file that her dad was normal-sized. - It's average-sized.
compared to you, I'm sure it was huge.
so did he have a fetish, or did he just fall in love with your long-legged soul?
he grew up in the circus. Said I reminded him of home.
seems like you're the one with the fetish.
I'm certainly curious about the logistics.
did you stand on a table? - House.
pretty much he'd flat and spin me. - Mom!
so, Abigail, you want to hop upon the table for me?
that's gonna be tough. - Oh, I'm sorry.
uh, let me give you a boost.
stop treating her like she's five.
just bring over a stool and let her climb up herself.
mom, it's okay.
I was just trying to be helpful.
she also hates Jews.
I've dealt with worse. Being different, you get used to people's idiocy.
still beats the hell out of actually being an idiot.
what?
care to go for a spin?
what the hell were you thinking?
you didn't think ratting out this hospital's best doctor merited checking with your boss first?
I didn't rat him out. I got him a deal.
which he'll never take.
he will if we - - How long have you known House?
did you think he'd suddenly become reasonable?
I made the deal. It's done.
you can either keep yelling at me, or you can help me avoid a complete disaster.
it already is gonna be a complete disaster.
he's not gonna take the deal. He's gonna go to jail.
because he's a child. He's too stubborn.
when a child misbehaves, what do you do?
you take away something he loves.
we can't take away his Vicodin.
not only will he be in pain, he'll start to detox.
we tell him the only way to get the pills back is to take the deal.
he won't be able to function. - That's the point.
you gonna explain that to his patient?
what choice do we have?
gallium scan shows no bright spots of any kind.
means it's not TB or any other infection.
there's no bright spots because the whole thing's too bright.
except for the liver.
the tech over exposed the image a bit, but it's nothing.
the liver looks fine. - Could be lung cancer.
tumor causes structural damage. Lung caves in on itself. Also explains the anemia.
doesn't explain the liver problem, though.
her lung collapsed. There is no liver problem.
you guys look at the liver on this thing?
there's no liver problem. - Seriously, look at the liver.
there's nothing there. - Why not?
because there's nothing wrong.
every organ in the scan is lit up like a 100-watt bulb.
except for her liver, which is hovering around 60 watts.
and not one of them good 60-watters, but an energy
you're saying her liver's shutting down because the lighting is off?
you just don't want a cancer diagnosis because then you'd have to deal with Wilson.
lung cancer is a lame diagnosis. Avoiding Wilson is an added bonus.
house, we need to talk.
not taking the deal. Glad we talked.
ultrasound her liver.
sit down. - Stand up.
your turn. - House, you're off the case.
your treatment privileges are suspended until you accept Tritter's deal.
well, I'm obviously not gonna take the deal just so I can have the fun of treating a dwarf.
so I assume there's more to this threat.
I'm also cutting off your Vicodin. - That could work.
I'm taking over as attending. Get an MRI of her lungs.
this is not lung cancer.
we'll find out as soon as we MRI her lungs.
you're gonna come begging me to save this girl long before I come begging your for pills.
I hope not. For everyone's sake.
this is wrong. - Cutting House off?
might not work, but it's not wrong.
bone windows looks clean.
Abigail, we need you to hold still, okay? - can I come out?
just hang in there two more minutes and we'll be done.
okay.
because it's effective doesn't make it right.
Cuddy's bending the rules to get a patient to do the right thing.
who'd work for a doctor like that? - And the ends justify the means?
if the ends involve us keeping our jobs, sure.
lung parenchyma is clean. No masses.
it's not lung cancer.
Abigail, you okay?
house was right. Her liver's failing.
endoscopy confirmed the vomiting was cause by variceal bleeding.
bloodwork also confirms House's hypothesis
I get it. House was right. It's the liver. Let's move on.
what causes liver disease and a collapsed lung?
schistosomiasis, the parasite - - There's no eosinophilia. - Cirrhosis could explain - - Could be a hepatoma.
she's 15. It's not liver cancer.
it's not unheard of.
cirrhosis fits better. The question is, what caused it?
could be hepatitis, Budd-Chiari. - Or drugs and alcohol.
if anyone has a reason to dull the pain, it's a teenage dwarf.
I'll do a liver biopsy to confirm.
I'll search the patient's home for drugs and alcohol.
cameron, you got a moment?
what exactly is your problem with me?
hepatoma is a weak diagnosis.
so this is all about the case? - What else would it be about?
I made this deal to help him.
and helped yourself at the same time.
this is not my practice. This is not about my car.
I gave both of them up to help House, and I would've gone on without them if hadn't almost maimed that little girl and if he hadn't punched out Chase.
was it an easy choice?
of course not, but it's right. - Then why wasn't it easy?
because he's my friend.
it's obviously complicated. - It's complicated?
when you decided to talk to Tritter, your life got a million times better.
how do you separate that out?
how do you pretend your windfall isn't relevant to this decision?
it was the right thing to do.
you pretending your motives are pure is why I have a problem.
Where's Cuddy? - In this drawer. It's a rescue mission.
but I got it under control. You can leave.
you were right about the liver failure.
patient had variceal bleeding which suggested cirrhosis, but
off the clock.
you predicted this. You obviously saw something.
obviously.
liver biopsy was negative for cirrhosis.
but it shows sclerosing cholangitis.
even weirder, there's no increase in alkaline phosphatase.
medical mystery.
sounds like the kind of thing I'd be good at.
breaking and entering. Sounds like the kind of thing you'd be good at.
I take it that's where Cuddy's been keeping your pills.
one theory, one drawer.
Really? I thought you'd be all for this "torture House plan."
it works, therefore it's good.
on the other hand, I don't want to talk you out of this deal by pointing out your hypocrisy, so patient's life at stake, blah, blah, blah, blah.
forget about the specific nature of the liver dysfunction. It's irrelevant.
the dwarf's problem is global. That's why the gallium scan was bright.
and it's gonna spread throughout her entire body unless you stop it.
if that were true, more than lungs and liver would be affected.
they will be. It'll spread though the biliary tree and hit her pancreas next.
strop retracing your steps. Get ahead of it.
forget the liver and focus on the pancreas.
cause after that - actually, after that doesn't really matter what it hits because pretty much all roads lead to a dead dwarf.
I get why you don't want to go to rehab.
but only an idiot goes to prison for being stubborn.
only an idiot stands between Ahab and his whale. Move.
sorry.
Santa's got gifts.
olive oil wasn't in the kitchen. It was in the medicine cabinet.
home remedy for ear infections.
ear infections are fairly typical among CHH dwarfs.
or it's a symptom.
certainly wouldn't indicate a pancreatic problem.
or House is wrong and it's a symptom.
laxatives. I don't think they were used to maintain her girlish figure.
again, intestinal problems are common - - Again, it might be a symptom.
and glucosamine suggests chronic joint pain
who ordered the Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency test?
I did.
you think the problem's in her pancreas?
well, I think it will be. I think we need to forget about the liver.
we just forgot about the lungs. Now we need to forget about the liver?
we need to stop retracing our steps and get ahead of this thing.
house, you've tanned.
you don't think I could've come up with this?
did you?
you suspended House because it'd be dangerous having him in charge, but getting his opinion
I'm sure he gave you that opinion simply because he was worried about the patient.
just because House wants his pills doesn't mean his theory is wrong.
no, the test results mean that. Your test was negative.
and the biopsy indicated severe duct inflammation.
do an ERCP to check the liver for bile duct cancer.
just because it wasn't Alpha-1 doesn't mean the pancreas isn't next.
you needed an organ. He needed a fix.
he'd have made up any story for a pill. You didn't give him anything, did you?
no.
there's no bruise or nothing, but it really hurts.
unfortunately, that pain and lack of bruising is typical of a zygomatic break.
that sounds bad. - Hmm, bones are aligned properly.
which ER did you go to after the car accident?
princeton Plainsboro. Here's my discharge slip.
okay. Gonna get you some acetaminophen with codeine.
I tried that, and it makes me nauseous.
uh, there's a drug called gabapentin which is good for certain kinds of pains.
great, 'cause I haven't slept in days.
Gabapentin's not really gonna help with the sleep.
is there something else you can give me?
uh, Vicodin's your best bet with sleep issues.
thanks so much.
unfortunately, our policy forbids prescribing opiates to new patients.
how can a clinic have a rule against relieving pain?
just with opiates. We find that it helps weed out drug seekers.
you think I'm a drug seeker? - I'm not saying that.
well, then give me the Vicodin. - I can't.
because you think I'm a drug seeker. - I just said I didn't.
no, you said that the policy was to stop drug seeking.
then you said I'm not a drug seeker. Policy doesn't apply.
I'm sorry. That's the policy.
gabapentin works on nerve damage. You're prescribing it for a broken face.
might as well hand out Band-Aids for a severed carotid.
you're a doctor.
not by this clinic's definition since I'm neither a moron nor a mindless drone.
security. - Forget it. I'll throw myself out.
that tube is going all the way down to my liver?
don't worry. You'll be sedated.
sometimes doctors have to do things that make people uncomfortable to help them.
but we always want to respect the patient's wishes and not shove things down their throats.
you haven't given her the sedative. - No.
she's unconscious.
check her airway.
airway's clear. Her breath smells fruity.
diabetic ketoacidosis.
hang an insulin drip at .1 mg per kg per hour.
pancreas is failing. You ready to call House yet?
you were right. The patient's pancreas is failing.
told you you'd come begging me for help.
her insulin production is almost non-existent
give me my pills or lose an arm. - The girl is dying.
so give me my pills. - Take the deal and I will.
you'd rather kill this girl than give me my pills.
I would rather lose one patient now than the dozens we will lose while you're in prison.
well, have fun explaining that to her itsy-bitsy grieving mother.
what if we sacrifice this girl and House still goes to jail?
I'd feel bad. Can we get on with this?
house correctly predicted the spread.
means we've got a global systemic illness affecting lungs, liver, and pancreas so far. Ideas.
langerhans cell histiocytosis attacks multiple organ systems.
histiocytosis usually starts in the brain, then moves to the internal organs.
Abigail's brain is fine. Cystic fibrosis.
exocrine function is normal. Hodgkins lymphoma.
it's a systemic cancer which her dwarfism predisposes her to.
do you have any ideas that aren't cancer?
cancer fits. - Autoimmune fits better.
we should treat her with prednisone for lupus.
that'll spike her blood sugar and put her back in a coma.
it's much safer just to run a double-stranded DNA test.
not if she dies before we get the results.
one of you is probably right. Why don't we hold the sniping until we find out which?
Wilson, do an IP for lymphoma. You guys, run an antibody test for lupus.
because of your daughter's dwarfism, we've had to pick a higher entry point for the lumbar puncture - which increases the risk. - So why not do the lupus test first?
in the interest of time, we think it's best to proceed on both fronts.
you have no idea what's wrong with my daughter.
we have several theories. - What does Dr. House think?
he's - he had to go home sick.
my daughter may be dying, and he's gone home with the sniffles?
he's not - -He was the only one who seemed to have any idea what was wrong with her.
he better be really damn sick.
he is.
unless you got Vicodin, go away.
house, it's me. I, uh
Oh, God.
I don't have-- - No pills, no eggnog.
what happened to your arm?
cut myself.
Wilson was wrong about lymphoma.
kid's not losing any weight, no night sweats.
Cuddy sends you?
no, she doesn't trust me not to give you pills.
is she right?
house, these cuts are straight in a row.
you did this on purpose.
cutting releases endorphins. Endorphins relieve pain.
you gonna get me some pills?
no. - Then you can leave.
no constitutional symptoms means soon as the kid gets cured, Cuddy's got no pressure to fold.
you really think she's gonna fold?
autoimmune fits better than cancer.
but lupus loves kidneys, usually attacks them first.
kidneys are fine, right? - Yeah.
house, take the deal. You can survive without Vicodin.
after you were shot, you stayed clean for months.
Yeah, I wonder if it had something to do with the absence of pain.
leave that. I want to be able to pour alcohol on it so I can distract myself.
then you can rip off the bandage.
kid been sick lately? There's a history of ear infections.
say Abigail's immune system is like a shy guy in a bar.
and the ear infections, they come in and try to coax him to--heh.
to hell with the metaphor. You get the point, right?
nerd gets drunk. Trashes the bar.
one of the autoimmunes triggered by a minor infection.
factor in her age, elevated sed-rate, anemia...
it's Still's disease.
you start her on prednisone, methotrexate, cyclosporin.
house. Stop this. Please.
What'd he say? - Still's disease.
it's chronic, but manageable. - A diagnosis that's virtually unconfirmable.
and with a treatment that's more dangerous than what we were considering for lupus.
how bad is he?
are you asking because you care, or because you're wondering whether to trust his opinion?
both.
he's detoxing. In agony.
he started cutting himself.
but he's still House.
I'll order the treatment.
your plan isn't working. Two days down, one to go.
figured I'd show you how much it isn't working.
Yeah, clearly the drugs have no hold on you.
we both know that my pride far surpasses my instinct for self-preservation.
you want to redeem yourself? Give up now.
and you'll go to jail.
I've done nothing wrong. - And you'll go to jail.
which makes this your last chance to do me a kindness before ruining my life forever.
the nausea's bad this time.
you can write me a scrip for metoclopramide so I can stop puking.
they'd give me that in rehab.
then you should go to rehab. I have a patient.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
I know it's little solace, but he went without pain.
well, look on the bright side.
at least you don't have to go by Mrs.Zebalusky anymore.
that's gotta be a relief. - You know this man?
I'm sorry. He's sick
did you hear my diagnosis on the dwarf? Still's disease.
did you even consider those ear infections, or you just wrote it off as a dwarf thing?
you sure he's dead? Dr.Wilson sometimes misses things.
trying to embarrass me in front of grieving widow crosses lines
right! I'm pathetic.
I'm strung out, I haven't slept, puking every hour, and I still out-diagnosed you.
but I'm supposed to let you decide what's best
please! Please leave.
sorry. I'm done.
you didn't come in here just to embarrass me. You could do that any time.
stealing oxy from a dead man.
Yeah, you don't have a problem.
how's the girl? - Much better.
house was right. - It happens.
I thought we could handle this.
Still's disease never crossed my mind.
don't beat yourself up. I didn't get it either.
I feel like a mob informant.
you wanna go inside?
got a cafeteria in there, right? - I can't testify.
drug addicts hurt the people around them with their habit.
house has hurt plenty of people, you included.
he saves lives. People that no one else can save.
and no matter how much of an ass he is, statistically House is a positive force in the universe.
the pills let him do that.
vicodin does not make House a genius. Whatever he does on the pills, he can do off.
he's just not willing to try.
I won't testify against him.
then we'll subpoena you.
and your previous statement will be read into evidence.
and you will be charged with interfering with an investigation.
and you will go to jail.
again, statistically, better me than him. - Statistically...
the two of you will be in jail.
Dr. Cameron! Dr. Cameron, come quick. There's something wrong with Abby.
couldn't be too severe. Her cardiac alarm didn't go off.
it's not her heart. She's bleeding.
picking up a scrip. Under Zebalusky.
this is, uh, Dr.Wilson's patient.
Yeah. Wilson's busy right now.
what with Mr.Zebalusky dying in agony on account of his metastic lung cancer and not having the pills to relieve that agony because of some moron pharmacist.
sign the book.
bleeding wasn't a ruptured eardrum, ear infection, or bleeding disorder.
her heart rate's climbing. Blood pressure's dropping. She's on the verge of a multi-system failure.
head CT was clean. Means it's not a neurological problem.
basically we have nothing. - Cancer is still on the table.
spinal fluid was negative for lymphoma.
what other - - Leukemia. We need to do a bone marrow biopsy.
none of the blood tests suggest leukemia.
cancer doesn't explain the collapsed lung.
unless a small clot lead to a pulmonary infarct.
it's a long shot. Autoimmune is way more likely.
autoimmune diseases respond to steroids, which we've given her.
and she got better for a while. We stopped the treatment too soon.
because she crashed.
all we're doing is bouncing back and forth between cancer and autoimmune.
we're going in circles.
give me half an hour.
can I have a French fry?
get your own. - You took the last ones.
what's wrong with you? - I got spinal muscular atrophy.
guess it not contagious.
nice bear.
it's a dog. - House. It's not Still's.
steroids helped until the patient started bleeding from the ears and mouth.
that's a bear. - His name is Bill. He's a dog.
you win. You can have Vicodin.
words have set meanings for a reason.
if you see an animal like Bill and you try to play fetch, Bill's gonna eat you because Bill's a bear.
are you on something?
you got your hands on pain meds.
bill has fur, four legs, and a collar. He's a dog.
it's between cancer and autoimmune.
see, that's what we call a faulty syllogism.
just because you call Bill a dog doesn't mean that he is...a dog.
we gotta X-ray our patient's leg.
her leg looks fine. - Weird, huh?
why aren't you detoxing? - Will power.
what - what
normal's not normal if you're not normal.
did you just take a pill? - No.
so how does a dwarf have completely normal growth plates?
it's impossible. We must be missing something.
how many pills have you taken?
not nearly as many as I'm gonna take. Forgotten how delicious they were.
I didn't give them to him.
can we forget my vices, get back to my virtues?
we were missing the fact that just because we called her a dwarf doesn't mean she is a dwarf.
everyone assumed she was because of her mother.
there's not test for CHH dwarfism.
so she lost an identity, but we gained a symptom.
if she doesn't have skeletal dwarfism, then her short stature must be caused by growth hormone deficiency.
and something's wrong with her pituitary gland. And based on her size, it's been wrong for a while.
so what connects a long-term pituitary issue with problems in the lungs, liver, and pancreas?
Oh, you guys and your bickering. Cancer versus autoimmune.
obviously you think it's something else. - Nope. I think it's both.
langerhans cell histiocytosis.
also known as, "you got your cancer in my autoimmune" disease.
the immune component responded to the Still's treatment.
lead to the short-term improvement. The cancer portion didn't.
we dismissed this earlier because there were no neurological symptoms.
Yeah. It's not your fault.
the only neurological symptom was her height.
who could've noticed?
this is your pituitary gland.
and this is the granuloma that's been crushing it.
no pituitary equals no growth hormone equals about that much.
she's not a dwarf?
just hormonally challenged.
what about my mom? - Your mom's the real deal.
but you're just a tiny little poser.
your recent ear infections caused your body to release a cascade of the same cells that made the granuloma.
they attacked your lungs, moved down to your liver, then hitched a ride over to your pancreas.
we can nuke them with a mild course of chemo and then remove the granuloma.
and then what? What will happen to her then?
let me see if I can make this clear.
this pill represents...a pill.
and my mouth represents your daughter's mouth.
we deposit the pill in the month.
you may never be tall enough to play in the WNBA, but you'll be able to post up your mom no problem.
what if I don't take the pills?
what if you remove the thing in my head and give me the chemo, but not the pills?
would I still get better?
your body needs growth hormone from lots of things. Like...to grow.
I like who I am now.
nobody your age likes who they are now. - I do.
you like needing help when you want something off a high shelf?
not being able to press an elevator button above the eighth floor?
having to smell ass every time you stand in line?
you don't need growth hormone. It's just your ticket out of the freak show.
can't you deliver a diagnosis without making her feel that her life isn't worth living?
I'm trying to help her.
you're trying to make her taller.
not too tall. Just tall enough to wipe her own butt.
are you high? - Higher than you.
if my daughter doesn't want to choose the easy path, I won't force her to.
then you're a lousy mom. You want your daughter to be a freak.
we're not freaks. - You want her to overcome adversity.
Yes. - Then why stop at height?
poke a stick in her eye. Imagine how interesting she'll be then.
being little is not the same as
you and I have found out that being normal sucks'cause we're freaks.
the advantage of being a freak is it makes your stronger.
now, how strong do you really want her to have to be?
tell her what you have to tell her.
tell her you lied.
even if you didn't.
this is who you were supposed to be.
you hate normal.
it's not that simple.
if I grow, I'll fade into the background.
I'll be boring.
we'll get you a funny hat.
you could never be boring.
you want me to be like everybody else?
I want you to have what I can't.
Abigail agreed - Abigail agreed to take growth hormone.
who's Abigail? - Your non-dwarf dwarf patient.
Oh, good.
then the growth hormone makes sense.
Christmas Eve. - Yeah, I know.
deal expires tomorrow.
you have plans for tonight?
you worried I'm gonna be popping more pills?
thought you might prefer people over pills.
Hey, mom. I guess you guys are already up at aunt Sarah's.
I'm sure dad's in the eggnog and you're probably suffering through another dried out turkey.
just wanted to say Merry Christmas.
house? Are you okay? I tried calling three times.
Larry Zebalusky. Dr. James Wilson. Take as needed. Not to exceed 4 per day. OXYCODONE
I'm ready to take the deal.
well, that's off the table.
the clock doesn't expire until
got new evidence. We don't need Wilson anymore.
the thing about addicts is, uh...
no matter how smart they are, they are dumb when it comes to drugs.
so, uh, I've been keeping an eye on the pharmacy log.
seems some patient of Wilson's named Zebalusky managed to pick up his oxy prescription after he died.
Jesus walks, huh?
merry Christmas.
hey
you got this all thing wrong, just rock star's supposed to be late, not the rock star photographer, sorry, it's morning sickness, touch the belly
it's first time I am being asked， come on, it's good luck
hit the kinos behind the drop.
so what do you think?
uh, I think people aren't gonna get it.
Oh, come on.
all-american rejects.
juxtaposing a classic image of Americana with modern pop culture, you.
Oh, yeah, everyone loves a good juxtaposition.
my fans were born in the '90s.
you know what? You do this picture, you'll gain 40 years fans.
yeah? - Yeah.
love the rockwell thing.
I thought so.
okay, kill the house lights, let's go.
hang on.
Hey, who's in charge of the backdrop?
Naomi? - Yeah?
what's wrong with it?
well, the words are completely jumbled.
what?
you can read that? - Of course.
you okay?
no. Oh, god.
I--I could be having a--a-- what's, --what's the mnemonic?
Uh...F...f is for face.
is my smile crooked?
what are you doing?
a...a is for arms. Arms...
you should really sit down.
can somebody get her some water?
s is...s is speech.
I'm slurring...
I'm slurring? Huh?
Oh, f-a-s-T.
t is time.
hurry, somebody, uh...
call 911, tell them I'm having a stroke!
Hi, I'm dr. House.
my boss says you're important.
personally, I don't get what's so hard about making scarlett johansson look pretty.
arms out in front of you.
your palms up, like you're holding a pizza.
close your eyes.
it's so easy, you should consider a career change.
probably make a lot more money.
Dr. Mackman tell you the clot was clear?
Yes.
and he said that you and the fetus are fine.
Yeah.
he didn't mention your pronator drift.
what's that mean?
it means mackman is an idiot.
may I?
Yeah.
so.
you take thousands of photos of someone, but only one has to look good.
kind a the opposite of my business.
it's not about looking good.
people are always hiding things.
I just keep shooting until I can see what's really inside them.
my eyes okay?
eyes are gorgeous.
vessels don't look so hot.
micro aneurysms predict further strokes.
this is gonna happen again?
unless I can figure out the underlying cause.
puff up your cheeks.
you should be able to keep the air in.
it means there's weakness around the mouth.
so where'd you learn to self-diagnose a stroke?
Oh, my, uh, baby's biological father is a neurologist.
he once told me the fast mnemonic could save my life one day, so...
interesting pet name.
most people go with "husband" or "pookie" .
he's gay.
just a sperm donor.
so when you
you turned him for a night?
just straight for one date?
okay.
he took a magazine and a cup into my bathroom.
man after my own heart.
different magazine, obviously.
I'm rescinding mackman's discharge order.
my lackeys will be in to do some tests, take some more blood, and empty your catheter bag.
not a moment you'll want to cherish.
this is definitely different.
it looks almost like...
he's caring.
find anything else in the patient's folder?
like a diagnosis?
urinalysis revealed excessive protein and red blood cells.
chem panel showed a creatinine level over 2. 5,so.
first she strokes, now her kidneys are shutting down--why?
ultrasound showed no tumors or stones, no signs of fetal distress, no urinary tract obstructions.
bp is fine, no preeclampsia.
any of you guys ever been to the galapagos?
was our patient there?
dengue fever, avian pox, even west nile.
no, I'm looking for a vacation spot.
that mean we get vacation?
how would that differ from your current status?
you're gonna do what, relax?
visiting family.
my uncle's a giant turtle.
what if the kidney failure came first?
kidneys could've caused the stroke, not the other way around.
kidneys don't often get stuck in the brain.
I'm saying it threw a clot.
early symptoms of kidney failure are nausea, vomiting, ankle swelling.
she could've mistaken it for morning sickness.
heart's way more likely to throw a clot than the kidney.
echo was normal.
history indicates no sign of cardiac problems.
no, but if one were to read the history closely, one would notice that she had six cases of strep.
in her throat. That's the one about ten inches above the heart.
let me rephrase.
six cases of untreated strep.
she was prescribed antibiotics.
no one takes them all.
they stop when they start feeling better.
all strep is untreated strep.
what happens when strep goes untreated?
it leads to rheumatic fever.
which leads to...cameron?
mitral valve stenosis.
which is a thickening in the valve of the...kidney?
no. Kidney doesn't have a mitral valve.
we'll go look at the heart.
it'll be easy to find.
it's the big red pumping thing about ten inches below her throat.
that was weird.
he was the way he always is.
which is weird.
very still, emma.
sorry. - No problem.
he caught us with your hand up my shirt.
he's gotta have a reaction to that.
you think that's what the vacation is?
Yes. The pain of losing you is obviously forcing him away.
coronal slice appears normal.
there's no way house just lets this slide.
he's gotta be planning something.
maybe he just doesn't give a crap.
sagittal slice is clean.
you think he just stumbled into that closet?
he knew we were there, and he wanted us to know that he knew.
or you wanted him to know, now he does, and you're annoyed because he doesn't care.
right there.
trans axial slice, calcified mitral valve.
barely. That's n big enough to throw a clot.
obviously it is, because it did.
house was right.
a valve in your heart is narrowed.
it caused the clot which led to your stroke, and the reduced circulation caused the problems with your kidneys.
and this'll fix it?
the balloon will force the valve back open.
and you'll be fine.
can I do this without a sedative?
it's very mild, there really is no risk to the fetus.
we'll monitor your baby's heart rate separately.
we won't allow it to decrease anywhere near dangerous levels.
thank you.
you're both gonna be fine.
go ahead, dr. Cameron.
listen to that heartbeat.
it sounds so...
start threading the catheter.
no, I don't want a layover in Frankfurt, Taipei, Singapore, or London, Ontario.
that's why I asked for a direct flight to phnom penh.
how hard is it to not land?
does it matter what I answer?
then fine, I'd be delighted to hold. What's new?
can you tell cuddy to stop interfering?
it's her job. What's new?
good news is emma's heart is fixed.
bad news is it's not her underlying problem.
her kidney'sare still failing.
you're vacationing in cambodia?
you gonna unwind in the killing fields?
Nope, gonna catch me a fish this big.
mekong giant catfish, weighs over 600 pounds.
aren't those catfish critically endangered?
that's why it's my last chance to catch one.
all of our operators are...
if the mitral valve had been properly fixed, the kidney should be getting better.
which leads us to the conclusion that you screwed up the procedure.
or you screwed up the diagnosis.
the mitral valve thickening was so insignificant, it probably wasn't the cause of the kidneys or the stroke.
probably never would've been a problem.
she needs dialysis, and we need a new theory.
there are only a few possibilities.
patient's pregnant, could be preeclampsia.
we eliminated it before
check for proteinuria and low platelets-- what else?
hypo perfusion, the fetusis basically a parasite stealing nutrients, minerals, blood.
put her on telemetry.
or the pregnancy's irrelevant.
could be infection, sepsis, hus/ttp.
a cholesterol embolism is just as likely.
tiny particles of cholesterol rain down and clog up the small vessels in the kidneys.
get a smear and ultrasound her vessels for plaque.
that's it, has to be one of those five.
you know what would be even better?
if we could narrow it all the way down to one.
thank you for holding.
we are experiencing extremely high call volume.
thank you for your patience.
she's 0 for 5.
either the differential was wrong, or she's faking it.
kidney failure has to be precipitated
by one of the five we've already ruled out.
the body only has so many ways of screwing with the kidneys.
the labs must be wrong.
we did the labs. No one else had access.
that's not quite true.
you put all your patients through this many tests, or just the important ones?
we wanted to explore all the possibilities.
And?
we've eliminated all the possibilities.
you telling me I'm dying and you have no idea why?
your body is functioning properly.
so why my kidney is failing the other body isn't.
there's something wrong with the fetus.
welcome to the world of maternal mirror syndrome.
mom's body is like an intricate German metro system.
all the trains run on time.
when she gets pregnant, it's like a new station opening in dusseldorf.
bunch of rookies running things, bound to be mistakes.
kids play on the tracks, get electrocuted.
before you know it, trains are backed up all the way to berlin, and you got a bunch of angry germans with nowhere to go.
and we all know that ain't good for the jews.
who are the jews in this metaphor?
a few things can happen to a fetus in distress.
it can become a miscarriage, still birth, very sick baby, or, on rare occasion, a time bomb that kills mom while it's dying.
good news is, we fix the fetus, mom gets better.
it's the diagnostic equivalent of a two-for-one sale.
I've read the outcome of mirror syndrome is almost always unfavorable.
Unfavorable... is that doctor speak for dead baby?
you think she'll be less upset if you phrase it nicely?
we can tell her the truth, that she'll be fine as soon as we diagnose a person who weighs about one pound.
can't touch it, can't ask where it hurts, can't see it.
if only there existed giant machines that could look through human skin.
mirror syndrome has a limited number of known causes.
tachyarrhythmia, fetal anemia, placental chorioangioma
all of which are fixable.
which would be un-unfavorable, right?
could also be trisomy 13, ebstein's anomaly, an aneurysm of galen's vein
then dr. Storm cloud rained all over the differential and killed the beautiful little baby.
heart's easiest to see, easiest to fix, so let's start tre.
when you did mom's mri, did you get a look at the fetus' heart?
it was in the range, but blurry.
the fetus was moving all over the place.
so we need another scan.
Yeah, we'll just ask the fetus to lie very, very still.
no need.
I'm going to paralyze it.
you want to paralyze emma sloan's baby?
let me guess. Cameron?
cameron and chase both had their concerns.
no, cameron had concerns.
chase just agreed with her because he didn't want to lose his all-access pass to her love rug.
they're sleeping together?
if by sleeping together you mean having sex in the janitor's closet.
here?
no, the janitor's closet at the local high school.
go, tiger cats!
do you have one of those camera phones?
cause I got a my space account.
I will deal with them after I deal with you.
Oh, come on, let's gossip some more.
I'm sure she's into bondage.
paralyzing a one-pound baby risks damaging
not paralyzing the thing risks not getting a clean mri of its heart.
which we need to save its life, which we need to do to save emma's life.
you're gonna need to get her consent.
that shouldn't be too hard.
sign here or you and your baby both die.
I'm going with you.
Oh, good.
you said sedation was risky. This sounds insane.
the injection goes into the umbilical cord.
the baby won't feel a thing.
fetus.
I'm lowering expectations.
it works here and on dates.
the benefits outweigh the risks, and the paralytic will wear off in an hour, okay?
must be easier to hear you might die than your baby might die.
but if there's anyone I would trust to save my baby, it would be dr. House.
fetus.
hold this.
Dr. Cameron. The mri results back?
the fetus' heart is structurally sound.
the problem's with the bladder. It's four times normal size.
let me see.
bladder's so engorged, it's taking up the whole torso, squeezing all the other organs.
there's no room for the lungs to develop.
the baby has a lower urinary tract obstruction.
we can fix that by inserting a shunt.
I'll give emma the news.
are you...taking over the case?
house won't care.
he has his diagnosis.
Dr. Cameron.
dating chase...
can only end in one of two ways.
house told you?
you get married and live happily ever after, or somebody gets hurt and you two can't work together, and I have to fire somebody.
I would hate to see my personal life become such a burden to you.
I'm telling you this for your own good.
well, I assume you're gonna have this same conversation with chase for his own good.
chase isn't the one that's gonna get hurt here.
there's only room for one.
though I could scooch over.
my social life is my social life.
couldn't agree more.
what goes on in the privacy of a janitor's closet is nobody's business except -
she told me to end it. Is that what you want?
I was actually hoping she'd fire one of you.
what are you doing?
trying to avoid altitude sickness.
couldn't score a direct flight to cambodia, so I've decided to scale argentina's infamous mount aconcagua.
perfect, except for the fact that you can't walk.
there's a tribe of mocovi Indians who actually carry the elders -
you're insane.
I'm an insane genius.
set the chamber to low pressure instead of high.
thinner air builds up extra red blood cells, creates new capillaries.
few more days in here, I can save myself six weeks in base camp.
Where's my mri?
there's a blockage in the urinary tract.
simple terms, your baby can't pee.
his bladder is swollen and it's crushing his lungs.
well, can you fix it?
we can insert a small tube in the baby's bladder that makes the urine come out straight through his belly for the duration of the pregnancy.
the bladder decompresses, and the lungs will be able to develop normally.
when the baby gets better, you should get better.
first we just have to do a test to determine whether the baby's kidneys are functioning properly.
a-and what if they're not?
if they're already too damaged, then there's really nothing we can do.
if this doesn't work out, you can always try again.
I miscarried twice when I was married.
after the divorce, I tried in vitro, like, four times before this.
I'm 42.
maybe it's, uh, just not meant to be.
what are you doing?
well, you're trying to be me, so I thought I'd try to be you.
you don't have the cleavage for it.
but I have a much tighter ass.
you think every day should be naked Thursday, or is that an oxymoron?
let me see the results of the bladder tap.
they aren't back yet.
they're gonna be inconclusive.
you think my diagnosisis wrong?
fetus doesn't pee, amniotic fluid should be low.
mom's level is fine.
doesn't mean I'm wrong.
could just mean we caught the obstruction early.
either way, your tests will be inconclusive.
the urine you collected has been sitting in that fetus' bladder for weeks.
and as my pappy always said, "stale pee is useless pee."
fine, then I'll do another tap.
just as useless.
old urine drops down from the kidney right after the first tap 'cause it's all backed up.
bladder tap number three will give you the freshest pee, and it's when you'll find out if this fetus has even a fighting chance.
thank you.
I'll run two more taps.
since when does the dean of medicine run bladder taps?
she's an important patient.
because she takes pictures?
or because she's you?
a woman in her 40s.
single.
using a turkey baster as a last gasp at motherhood.
and you wanna make sure she succeeds, so you'll still have hope.
can't be a good doctor if you're not objective.
it's your file.
I don't want it.
then why did you just say all that stuff?
to humiliate you.
you're taking the case back. - I don't want it.
your diagnosis is right. I wanna go on vacation.
you can go on vacation after you've cured her.
good news.
the fetus' urinehad appropriate levels of protein and electrolytes, so his kidneys aren't damaged.
we're gonna put the shunt in, your baby's lungs should have more room to grow, and your symptoms should go away.
but he'll still need surgery after he's born?
that's when we'll remove the blockage in the ureter.
you'll be the only mother on the planet who appreciates the value of a wet diaper.
Hey, could you hand me that?
I'm keeping a visual memory book of this entire surreal process, and this is the best part of the story so far.
Yeah, sure. - Thanks.
when did you take this?
Oh, she did the second bladder tap.
you should keep it.
Oh, I see her all day at work, I don't need it.
maybe you wanna see her after work.
I'm right, right?
I saw the way you look at her.
Thanks.
shunt is in the right position.
the bladder's starting to decompress.
no infection.
did house say anything else? About us?
I thought you didn't care about his reaction.
trying to make him jealous?
I like my job.
he can't fire you just because we're together.
we're not together, and house can do whatever he wants.
how's my baby?
doing just fine, emma. So are you.
my stomach is killing me.
that's not her stomach.
can you open your eyes, emma?
I just need to take a look.
what is it?
Emma's jaundiced.
her liver's shutting dowN.
figures.
I just booked my trip to johnston strait.
I thought you were climbing mount whatever in argentina.
apparently I'd have to live with the mocovi indians for 20 years before they'd consider me an elder.
decided to go kayaking with orca instead.
no legs required. - Can't leave yet.
liver failure puts her case back in the unsolved pile.
increased ast, alt, and her bilirubin's off the charts.
even fetuses lie.
we diagnosed a lower urinary tract obstruction because we saw one.
what if that's not the whole story?
what if the little bugger is hiding something?
real reason for the mirror syndrome.
have we looked under its bed?
have we checked its diary?
if it's not gu, it could be the heart.
hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
there were no structural problems. - Lungs.
we won't be able to get a good look until they develop. It'll be weeks.
he's not gonna last weeks.
what do you wanna do?
maternal mirror syndrome has one surefire cure.
deliver the fetus.
that's not viable at 21 weeks. You'lll the baby.
fetus.
semantics make you feel better? Pretend it's not a person?
can it play catch?
can it eat?
can it take pretty pictures?
who wants to tell her?
the swollen bladder was not the only problem.
we can't leave it inside you. We have to terminate.
well, can't you deliver him?
put him on a respiratory machine till-- till you figure out what's wrong.
we can.
it won't matter.
the fetus is still at least two weeks away from being viable.
Oh, well, I'll suffer through this for two more weeks, then.
you're on dialysis for your kidneys.
your kidneys can wait.
they don't make dialysis for your liver.
you're not gonna make it two more days.
I'm not gonna let you kill my baby.
it's killing you.
I'm not having an abortion.
it's not a baby.
It's...a tumor.
I understand dying for a cause, sacrificing your life so your child might live.
but that's not the choice here.
either it dies, or you both die.
or you fix him, and we both live.
I can't fix it.
I'm scheduling a d and C.
I won't consent.
so i guess you have two days to figure it out.
her kidneys are almost irreparable.
she's developed severe dic.
you have to force her to terminate.
did you give corticosteroids to speed the baby's lung development?
no, I dropped an anvil on its chest to prevent lung development.
I'm trying to extinguish the human race one fetus at a time.
give the lungs more time to expand so you can see inside them, see if they're the problem.
my real patient is dying. Very quickly.
like, I wouldn't advise her to buy any green bananas.
the fetus is nothing more than a parasite at this point.
removing it is an instant cure.
you're not gonna get emma to see it that way.
she's probably already named the baby.
read him books, had conversations with him.
you get it.
she'll listen to you.
no.
you let this woman refuse to terminate, you're helping her commit suicide.
as her doctor, my recommendation is against suicide.
if the baby had a doctor,
I think she would recommend exhausting all possibilities before taking its life.
then she'd be an idiot.
too bad she's your boss.
what if our original assumption is wrong?
it isn't.
if we assume she doesn't have mirror syndrome, then terminating her pregnancy isn't gonna help her liver at all.
we eliminated all other possibilities.
the fetus is hydropic and in distress.
Emma's kidneys and liver are failing.
the diagnosis is solid.
the ass-kisser won't agree with you.
you must be even wronger than I thought.
fine.
let's assume she had mirror syndrome, but we fixed it when we fixed the baby's bladder.
that means that her failing liver would be completely unrelated.
if it is, we can fix it.
and we don't have to terminate.
so her theory is that our patient's liver problems were just a giant coincidence.
it's not a surprising coincidence.
pregnant women can develop liver problems.
if this is the case, we can actually do something here.
don't you guys think that's worth exploring?
acute fatty liver of pregnancy would have the same symptoms.
thank you.
brown-noser.
viral hepatitis, hellp syndrome.
Oh, look, sticking up for your girlfriend.
who says chivalry's dead?
he's not joking?
be patient.
she's going through all of us, she'll get that jungle fever eventually.
I'm not going through anyone.
you love him?
this can probably wait until after you biopsy emma's liver, right?
we can't, her platelets are too low.
once we pierce her liver, it'll be next to impossible to stop the bleeding.
come in from above.
instead of going straight in through her abdomen, go in through the veins in her neck.
trans jugular hepatic biopsy.
if the liver starts to bleed, it'll bleed right back into her own veins.
why don't you start your vacation now?
threading the guide wire through the right internal jugular vein.
so...
the sleep lab?
you and cameron not sleeping.
how serious is it?
it's nothing.
she's only doing it to make house jealous.
then why are you doing it?
are you kidding?
approaching the inferior vena cava.
slow down.
you better not hurt her.
she already has a big brother. - She does?
you obviously care very deeply about her.
I'm not protecting her, I'm protecting myself.
a heartbroken, lovesick cameron...
would be even more unbearable than she is now.
you're through the hepatic vein.
firing the needle.
heart rate and bp spiking.
get that out of her.
fetus' heart rate just dropped to 50.
we've got contractions.
pre-term labor.
start a terbutaline drip.
we were able to control the pre-term labor with tocolytics.
the contraction shave subsided for now.
and the liver biopsy was negative.
this is definitely mirror syndrome.
her baby's doing this to her.
we're out of options.
did the biopsy cause the pre-term labor or did it happen on its own?
it doesn't make a difference.
pre-term labor can be a new symptom.
new information gives us new theories.
isn't that how it works?
not in this case.
her body's trying to do what you refuse to.
get the baby out and save itself.
patient's transaminases are ten times normal.
her liver's on the verge of shutting down completely.
a torch test could
we don't have time for more tests.
we have to terminate or she'll die.
then let's work faster.
medicine doesn't work faster just because you hope real hard.
but it could help to see what the baby's been hiding.
the only organ we haven't been able to look inside is its lungs.
the problem must be in there.
we haven't been able to see inside because they're under developed.
we've already got her on corticosteroids, - but it'll take weeks for them-- - then let's drown them in corticosteroids.
multiple courses, speed up their development.
giving the baby more than one course will suppress adrenal gland function.
have long-term adverse effects on fetal organ development.
worse than death? - emma's already on tocolytics.
the combination could put her into pulmonary edema.
you'll just kill her faster.
it's the only chance we have to see inside those lungs.
we're just gonna have to make the baby better faster than we make emma worse.
come on, this is the kind of thing house does every day!
house thought we should terminate six hours ago.
I'll do it myself.
anybody gonna stop her?
stopping the madness is her job.
somebody's gotta be cuddy's cuddy.
nurse!
pulmonary edema? - Who tattled?
doesn't matter.
there's a reason we don't give multiple courses of corticosteroids.
gee, thanks.
it's time to terminate.
that's not what she wants.
look at her.
she didn't want to be an incubator for a dead baby, but that's what you've done.
either get me a laryngoscope or get out.
you were right.
you were all right.
now the mom's lungs are shutting down.
she's dying faster than the baby's lungs are developing.
I had to stop the corticosteroids.
have you spoken to the family?
the only family she's got is that baby.
well, he's biased.
what do you think house would do?
house wants to terminate.
I mean if he didn't.
if he shared my position, what do you think he would do?
he wouldn't share your pain.
he'd be objective.
right.
he would prioritize his problems.
he'd terminate.
he wouldn't be afraid of screwing with her lungs if there was a bigger issue.
there is no bigger issue. She needs her lungs.
not right now.
she's already on a respirator.
the machine is breathing for her.
I can do whatever I want to her lungs.
if you're playing catch in the living room and you break your mother's vase, you may as well keep playing catch.
the vase is already broken.
Yeah, except that room can't breathe without that vase.
I'm putting her back on corticosteroids.
it worked. - What worked?
I got the baby's lungs to expand.
we should be able-- - cab's on its way.
I have to finish packing.
I have a whole new appreciation for what you do.
how hard it is to believe when everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong.
helps to know they're idiots.
do you think I'm an idiot?
you're not objective.
but you're not an idiot.
these lungs are still two weeks away from being viable.
but big enough for a diagnosis.
these tissue buds are new.
could indicate bronchopulmonary sequestration or diaphragmatic event ration.
I was thinking Broncho genetic cyst or bronchial atresia.
could be lung lesions, ccam.
what about
move.
I thought you started your vacation.
somebody had to save our boss' rotundus ass.
latest mri of the sloan fetus.
small buds in the lungs could indicate
Thanks, got that multiple choice all worked out.
question is, how do we pick between a, b, c, d and none of the above?
portable mri's in her room.
we could get a current image
fetal lungs are so tiny, an mri won't give us the details we need.
what would we do if this patient were not just a tadpole?
say it was an actual person.
He...is a person.
thanks for playing along.
pretend it's a one-pound adult.
forget the mom, forget the womb, the placenta.
how would we get a better look at what's in the lungs?
Transe sophageal echo.
can't access its esophagus.
high-resolution CT could give us a clearer -
too much radiation for a one-pound person.
you can't just shoot everything down, chase.
you're not me. Collaborate.
a ventilation perfusion scan would be next.
how do we get a fetus to breathe in a radioactive isotope?
idiot.
if it were really a person and we had no other options, we'd do an exploratory surgery.
cut into its chest and have a look around.
let's do that.
you're the one who insists we treat it like a person.
I'll put it back when I'm done.
me again.
your friendly neighborhood belly-squirter.
we're gonna do open fetal surgery.
we open the uterus, cut out the fetus so we can look around.
I know you can't talk, so
I need you to look petrified if you consent.
the umbilical cord won't be cut.
during surgery, your body will basically serve as the baby's heart-lung machine.
we find what's wrong and we fix it.
if we can.
don't lower expectations if you want them to do something.
she should know what she's facing.
this is incredibly dangerous.
it risks both your lives.
the only reason why we're suggesting it is because there's nothing else we can do.
you all here for the fetal surgery?
we are way over capacity.
mind each other's personal space.
there are sharp implements in the room.
like this one.
uterus is fully exposed.
and we're in.
start draining the amniotic fluid.
have you never sucked beer out the bottom of a keg?
Where'd you go to college? - Gimme that.
affix the pulse ox to the palm.
sorry.
I just realized I forgot to tivo alien.
fetal heart rate good, stats are stable.
position him for the incision.
all right, I see three well-defined lesions.
it's definitely ccam.
I should be able to resect them.
it's the mom. She's in v-fib.
charging.
clear!
I'm clear.
looks like asystole, paddling's not gonna do anything.
it's fine v-fib! I'm going again.
clear!
we're gonna lose them both. Clamp.
the surgery's not doing this to her, the fetus is.
step away, house, I'm going again.
the only way to save her is to cut away the anchor holding her down.
you keep going, you're gonna get electrocuted.
clear!
going again. Clear!
heart rate's returning to normal.
continue with the lobectomy.
so my kidneys, liver, and lungs are all fine?
just like that?
just like that.
that's amazing.
what's amazing is how blond your baby's hair is.
my baby?
you know, the thing in your belly that tried to kill you.
you've never called him a baby before.
any pain?
nothing I can't deal with.
you can only get out of bed to pee, poo, or shower.
and absolutely no sex, so stop flirting with me.
sorry.
so this really worked? He'll be...
normal?
if you call being born twice normal.
Hey, thank you.
don't thank me.
I would a killed the kid.
wanna grab a bite?
in a minute.
Emma asked me to bring up her camera.
I'll walk you.
When'd she take this picture of you?
you look so...
I'm smiling.
I have a nice smile.
no, I've never seen you like this.
she got you to...
glow.
what were you doing?
What'd she say to you?
I always glow.
need you to take a look at something.
I'm off the clock. - Just open it.
first class ticket to vancouver island.
shoot! It's the wrong envelope.
I think it's great. - Yeah?
who doesn't like canadians?
it's big. You're-- you're trying to have a life.
you're trying to enjoy yourself.
you didn't need to apologize.
I'm not, I told you why I'm
you screwed up.
I saved a life. I saved two lives.
you let your maternal instinct get the best of you and nearly killed two people.
case like this, you terminate, mom lives 10 times out of 10.
you do what you did, mom and baby both die 9. 9 times out of 10.
sometimes . 1 is bigger than 9. 9.
no, it's smaller.
exactly 9. 8 smaller.
always is, always will be.
well, not for emma.
and not for her son.
now go away.
and be happy.
are you alright?
all of a sudden you went away are you alright?
I hope you come back around some day are you alright?
I haven't seen you in a real long time are you alright?
could you give me some kind of sign?
are you alright?
are you sleeping through the night?
do you have someone to hold you tight?
do you have someone to hang out with?
do you have someone to hug and kiss you?
hug and kiss you hug and kiss you are you alright?
Jasper, hold still. Stop squirming. Hold still.
what did he do now?
he got in another fight.
and I can't get his nose to stop bleeding.
you have to apply much more pressure than that.
you had to do this today.
I got office hours. Supposed to have dinner with the dean.
you just can't lash out whenever you get angry.
he said I smell like a monkey.
well, you do. You can't refuse to take a bath and then hit kids who tell you that you smell. Damn!
don't you think we should call 911?
this isn't his first nosebleed. He'll be fine.
daddy! - Hey, lucy-goosey.
I'm playing doctor. - So am I.
can you go back and play?
when was this fight? - Over ten minutes ago.
I feel dizzy.
maybe you should make that call. - Okay.
daddy, look. I can help.
No--that's great, honey.
can you just please leave daddy alone?
one of my kids is bleeding profusely from the nose. Please hurry.
they're sending an ambulance.
call them back.
he'll be fine.
how you feeling, bud?
you light headed? - Lucy.
Oh my god.
Lucy, are you okay? Lucy.
Lucy, are you okay?
Oh, for god's sake.
stop. Don't move.
the way the soft...evening light catches your eyes.
the gentle caress of dusk on your hair as you turn around and leave my office without giving me that file.
restrictive pericarditis. - Boring.
she's in kindergarten. - Less boring.
or grandma's been held back a few years.
it's calcified and she's hypertensive.
better get her into surgery.
she already is in surgery.
tricky procedure. Gonna take all night.
sleep tight.
no congenital defects, no health problems.
but her heart is strangling itself.
fascinating.
since the pathology on the pericardium won't be back until after they remove it.
get started on her blood. you can test for viral infections, bacteria...
round up the usual suspects.
amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis...
heck. Go wild. Do all the osises.
all taken care of. Sleep tight.
this thing is already all around her heart.
if it gets into the muscle, she's dead.
best bet is coxsackie virus.
parvovirus b-19, cmv...
bacterial infection's more likely to turn constrictive.
it could be tb. - Right.
forgot about the part where she did time in a russian gulag.
her hematocrit's elevated.
a few extra red blood cells means nothing.
she's probably just dehydrated.
Yes, and I could assume three or four things to fit my theory too.
she's sick. She obviously hasn't been drinking
enough!
I take it you two aren't sleeping together anymore?
we do what house said. We test for everything.
good.
then I can go home.
since when does we not include you?
well, house is gonna call us idiots anyway.
might as well be a well-rested idiot.
you guys are idiots.
Why?
because we stayed up all night doing exactly what you told us to do?
no, because you stayed up all night doing exactly what I told you to do and have nothing to show for it.
we eliminated dozens of wrong answers.
I asked you what two plus two equals.
and a day later, you tell me, not 25.
pathology report just got filed.
found granulomas in lucy's pericardium.
indicates a fungal infection.
nice work.
he went home.
work smart, not hard.
find out which fungus. Biopsy a lymph node.
take "employee of the month" with you.
I would rather foreman-- - I know.
I don't want anymore shots. - I don't want anymore shots.
look at me, goosey. Squeeze my hand, okay?
this will tell us why you're sick, so we can make you all better.
where would she pick up a fungus?
anywhere moist. Around a pool, locker room, public shower.
she doesn't have any gym or swim classes.
she doesn't even like to play with kids outside.
haven't taken any trips? Gone anywhere new?
it's been hard to get away... since their mom.
my mom's dead.
I'm sorry. - Last year.
brain cancer.
you're gonna stick that thing in her arm? Cool!
the cool part is, your sister won't feel a thing.
nice necklace.
Thanks.
you like videogames?
love them.
that should do it.
you okay?
I want my bunny.
are you being silly?
I don't know which one to take.
what do you mean? What's happening?
so what does the double vision tell us?
slit lamp revealed the eye's anterior chamber is swollen. Uveitis.
means it's not a post-op effect and it's not neurological.
it's not fungal either. The lymph node biopsy was clean.
so we're back to square one.
one and a half. We've eliminated two more conditions.
Yes. Two plus two doesn't equal 12 or 16 either.
vision issues plus screwy heart equals some type of auto-immune.
lupus and kawasaki's are the most common in a six-year-old.
Yeah, tough to find a six-year-old who doesn't have lupusor kawasaki'S.
did you look at her knees?
those knobby things in the middle of her legs.
any scars or scabs?
what does that have to do... - most six-year-olds hurt themselves a lot.
the crash their bikes, climb trees, bungee jump.
dad said she doesn't like to run around outside.
because running around outside hurts.
she didn't mention anything about...
most six-year-olds are not familiar with the phrase, "my joints feel inflamed.
so two plus two equals...
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
we're checking her ana to confirm and giving her steroids to fix her vision.
some idiot gave me two tickets for a play tonight.
saved his life. Apparently worth $186.
sorry, I had to take a leak.
Oh, I...I didn't know you were seeing a patient.
it's an exam room. What did you think I was doing?
what you usually do--hiding from cuddy.
be stupid to do it in here. There's a patient in here.
you been drinking more? - Uh, no, I...
guy's peeing all the time.
the play, interested?
sure. You want me to pick you up?
I'm not going. You said two tickets.
you thought this was a date?
any other symptoms? - My stomach hurts.
I have back pain and muscle aches. I feel dizzy.
and I have trouble concentrating sometimes in class.
I really should...
you want the tickets or not?
why don't you wanna go with me? - It's a play.
dudes only go to plays if they're dragged by women they're hoping to see naked.
so why are you giving them to me?
maybe there's someone you wanna see naked.
I
all right.
any fever? - No.
anything in your pee other than pee? - No.
I'm gonna need a urine sample. - No.
Yeah, that last one wasn't a question.
you might have diabetes. - I can't pee in public.
we have bathrooms.
I can't pee in public bathrooms.
where can you pee?
I only live a few miles from here.
I thought arthritis was for old people.
Jra's an autoimmune disease.
her body's attacking itself, causing inflammation in the joints, her eyes, and her heart.
is it treatable?
it can be crippling.
but it can also go into complete remission.
well, the good thing is we caught it early.
gives her the best chance to have a positive outcome.
da
don't get up, goosey.
your stitches.
she's having a stroke.
stroke was caused by a clot in her middle cerebral artery.
started her on tpa.
should dissolve the clot and hopefully prevent brain damage.
but we won't know for sure until she regains consciousness.
or she has another stroke.
Arthritis...heart disease.
why can't this kid act her age?
jra doesn't affect the blood.
means the clot's a symptom of something else.
it's a symptom of polycythemia. She's fully hydrated.
her blood's still thicker than pancake batter.
thick blood explains the stroke.
can also have caused an auto-immune response.
which would explain the jra kicking into gear.
but what explains the thick blood?
lack of oxygen forces the body to over produce red cells.
what explains the lack of oxygen?
carbon monoxide fumes, cigarette smoke.
I doubt our patient's a smoker. Dad could be.
he's not.
he says he's not. - Hey!
don't make me turn the hose on you two.
chase is right.
you two go check the house. See if dad's a closet marlboro man.
you're intention ally punishing us.
by making you do your job? It does seem kind of cruel, doesn't it?
take along a carbon monoxide detector to check for leaks.
and you, start her on hydroxyurea to control her red blood cell production.
dig out a merck manual, medieval edition, tell you how to drain a pint or two so she doesn't clot again.
Dr. Cameron!
I got you flowers. For helping my sister.
that's so sweet.
does your dad know you're down here? - Yes.
congratulations on your bundle of joy.
something you forgot to tell me?
you should take these back to where you found them.
okay.
excuse me, can you make sure these flowers and this kid get back to where they belong?
sure. - Thanks.
let's go. Come on.
wait.
so you're just draining blood from her?
you're not testing it, you're not fixing it?
your daughter's vascular system is engorged with blood.
draining some reduces the chances of another stroke.
we're also starting her on a drug that suppresses the production of red cells so we don't have to keep doing this.
good chance she'll make a full recovery.
she hasn't spoken yet. - Give her time.
this is your boy?
where have you been? - Exploring.
see ya. - Thank you.
you know, you just can't run off without telling me.
okay. Can I have two dollars?
oven's a long shot. They'd smell the gas long before anyone got sick.
Yeah, right. House loves it when we skip something 'cause it's a long shot.
why'd you take the flower? Why'd you kiss him?
he did something sweet.
he stole flowers. - He's eight.
you were trying to make me jealous.
Yeah, I want you to profs your love for me.
Oh, wait, you already did that.
and it caused me to end our relationship.
you're enabling a thief.
and a delinquent.
letters from school.
fights, detentions, a parent conference.
Oh, I know, I know.
the bad boy is hard to resist.
it's a crush. It's harmless.
it's never harmless. - So I'm learning.
so this is us now?
we snipe at each other?
I'm not sniping, I'm looking for a vent.
her room's directly above the garage.
there's all sorts of co sources down there.
I found a vent.
I think there's something in it.
this isn't right.
you dumped me. You don't get to be mad.
we had a really good thing.
you broke the rules. I'm angry.
I'll get over it.
she's being abused.
a bloody t-shirt doesn't equal abuse.
kids get hurt all the time.
that amount of blood?
Oh, crap.
you two are agreeing again.
father's overwhelmed. Hectic job, his wife passed away last year.
he could easily be taking it out on the kids.
or she had a nose bleed and grabbed a t-shirt.
she's so ashamed of a nosebleed she has to hide the evidence in a vent under her bed.
she's socially isolated, the brother's always in trouble.
it's classic signs.
but no physical signs. No marks on her body. No bruises at all.
what if it's sexual?
we should call social services.
well, this sucks.
either it's abuse or it's not abuse.
which means either it's a symptom or it's completely irrelevant.
either way, we gotta waste half a day figuring out which.
full physical exam.
look for bruises we may have missed.
check her mouth and do a vaginal exam.
we can't do a vaginal exam on a six-year-old without the dad's consent.
and if he's abusing her, he'll never say yes.
never is just "reven" spelled backwards.
have you been abusing your daughter?
what? Why would you...
we found this hidden in a vent under her bed.
I don't know anything about this.
maybe she had a bloody nose.
we need to examine her for abuse.
you can't really think I...
maybe you, maybe the school bully, maybe the creepy neighbor.
I'm guessing you're not paying as much attention as you should be.
you even know where your son is right now?
Yeah, he was here just...here a minute ago.
she isn't being abused.
unfortunately, that answer doesn't help me.
if you have abused her, you're obviously gonna lie about it.
I'm not lying!
we need to do a vaginal exam. - No, she may be dying, she still can't talk, and you're gonna waste your time with this?
you consent, and we waste a few hours doing the exam, or you refuse and I call social services.
and they waste three days doing the investigation which ends with them doing the exam anyway.
I'm gonna look inside your mouth. Open wide.
I need to look at your chest and your back next, okay?
I know you can't talk so stop me if you get scared.
before you came here, did anyone hurt you?
make you bleed?
I need to look in your vagina now. Do you understand?
I'm a doctor, so it's okay, all right?
bend your knees, keep your ankles together.
and just let your knees fall to the side, okay?
Oh, my god.
she has cuts all over her genital area. Like slices.
some are almost healed, but some are new.
she could be doing it to herself.
she's a little young to be cutting.
she's a little young for a stroke.
depression accounts for the cuts.
molestation accounts for the depression.
but do the cuts account for all that blood?
they weren't deep enough.
so she's getting cut, but that's not the source of the blood?
the other obvious source is forcible penetration.
obvious source of the blood, not the cuts.
and there was no tearing. There was no evidence at all.
so we have no explanation for the cuts or the blood.
where is he?
what if our original assumption was wrong?
meaning what?
we found a t-shirt covered with blood hidden in the heating vent.
how do we know it's even hers?
her dad identified it.
not the shirt, the blood.
are--are those the urine test results? - Yes.
and... - I'm going to ask you for some blood.
Why?
to see if your answer will be, I can't bleed in public.
this wasn't your urine, was it?
why would I give you someone else's urine?
the usual reason is because you're on steroids.
I'm not an athlete.
second favorite reason is because you're on drugs.
I'm not. - I am.
third favorite reason is, you have insurance, but your friend eggs benedict doesn't.
so eggs describes a list of symptoms and you repeat them to a doctor.
which is particularly stupid because this is a free clinic.
need you. Now.
my work here is done.
am I okay? Is it diabetes?
no, you're pregnant.
six-year-old abuse victim and you haven't called social services?
she might have been abused? That's horrifying.
why are you wearing extra concealer under your eyes?
the law is clear. You suspect abuse, you call the authorities.
you don't proceed as usual while the possible abuser sits by her bedside.
dad consented to the exam, which means it's not the dad.
how late were you out last night?
it's always the dad. And I don't have a curfew.
panty hamster get a spin on its wheel?
I went to a play.
house, you are going back to your office.
you are picking up your phone, calling social services, and you are reporting suspected abuse.
do you understand?
what play?
you're trying to have sex with cuddy.
fries? - You took her to a play.
you only take women to plays because
no, you only take women to plays for that reason.
that's your theory.
okay, then why did you take her to a play?
she's a friend. - A friend with a squish mitten.
it is possible to have a friend of the opposite sex.
blasphemer!
she's not a friend of the opposite sex, she's a different species.
she's an administrator.
she's gonna eat your head after she's done.
Yes, I slept with her.
Seriously? - No.
Yes, you did.
Yes, I did.
Seriously?
no. You got a problem, house.
we just tested the blood on lucy's t-shirt.
it's full of endometrial cells.
so it's not her blood.
we tested that too. It is.
your six-year-old patient?
it's menstrual blood.
she's started puberty.
how can someone start puberty before they even start the first grade?
she was in diapers two years ago.
for some reason, her body has too much sex hormone.
caused her reproductive system to get confused.
start operating prematurely.
we need to find out the source of the hormones and cut it off.
she's so young.
I haven't even...talked to her about sex.
I doubt she even knows what a period is.
girls talk to their moms about that.
you're going to be okay, goosey.
I love you.
I...
want...
juice.
she got her period and didn't know what it was.
she was scared and confused.
her friend told her to put a t-shirt in her underwear.
when she started growing pubic hair, she snuck daddy's razor and tried to shave it off.
apparently, forgot to sneak the shaving cream.
tumors, most likely.
a pituitary adenoma would send her hormone level sky-high.
in puerto rico in the '70s, there was an epidemic of kids growing breasts because of estrogen in the poultry.
if it was in the food, it would be an epidemic.
we've got one kid. - She's six. She's tiny.
she lives on chicken fingers and milk.
dad doesn't look like the type to read labels.
he's probably buying stuff packed full of hormones.
excellent argument.
it's a tumor.
there's all sorts of environmental sources: Pesticides, soy products.
some shampoos are basically a placenta in a bottle.
if the tumor's not in her brain, it's her reproductive tract. Get an mri.
can I at least-- - waste your time?
wouldn't recognize you if you didn't.
frontal cortex is clean. Moving caudally.
for the record, cameron's the one who broke it off.
not interested.
no masses in the hypothalamus.
I wanted more.
she didn't share my feelings.
I feel like I'm in a similar position.
pituitary's clean.
you're an idiot.
either she's lying, or she's actually emotionally detached.
which one sounds more like cameron to you?
neither.
you have to choose one.
there's a bright spot on the left ovary.
looks like a solid tumor.
they printed my letter.
you were right.
of course I was. What are we talking about?
they printed my letter. - Great.
you wanna see her naked.
no, no, no. She wants to see me naked.
she sent me flowers.
she's just thanking you for the play.
see, some people feel an emotion called gratitude
there's a card. - I suspected.
explains how you knew who they were from.
let's do it again...soon. Xx, lisa.
x's are the kisses, right?
no, I think they're the gs. The o's are the kisses.
no, no. The x's are definitely the kisses.
soon" is its own sentence.
I gotta go!
I'll miss you.
you were a good friend.
they printed my letter.
how was the play, mrs. Lincoln? - What's up with wilson?
he's just a little freaked. - Why?
I sent him flowers.
Jasper, you' not supposed to be up here.
is that other doctor your boyfriend?
no.
your dad's probably looking for you.
he's got enough to worry about right now.
do you like him?
he's a friend.
do you like him like him?
we should get you back to your dad.
let me put this down and I'll take you there.
I could be your boyfriend.
I...
think that wouldn't be fair to the girls your own age.
he seems like a tool.
he's not. And that's rude.
I'm taking you back to your father.
mass is small--about a centimeter across.
firing the biopsy needle.
you nick an artery? - No.
she's in v-tach; no pulse.
charging 50. Clear!
clear!
clear!
arrhythmia must've been a reaction to the hydroxyurea.
we have to stop the drug therapy.
her bone marrow will just go back to over producing blood cells.
she'll keep having strokes, and we'll have to keep bleeding her...forever.
we resect the tumor, hormone levels go back to normal, her symptoms go away
great plan...
except for the fact that her tumor's not a tumor.
it's a benign cyst.
if it's not a tumor, that just leaves an environmental source.
feeling another late night.
I'm gonna leave you two alone.
you're kidding me, right? -What?
the answer's right there. It's just a question of finding it.
you don't need me for that.
don't get the mochaccino.
they screwed up and put hot chocolate in the dispenser.
thank you. -You were right.
the eight-year-old kid grabbed my ass.
I shouldn't have encouraged him.
well, I was a boy once. I know how they think.
you were a pervert at eight? -Maybe 11.
I didn't realize you were gonna get hurt.
I'm sorry I misled you.
you didn't.
you have feelings for me.
you come back to me again and again.
for sex. It's a simple, physical
you have feelings for puppies and patients that you barely know.
but when it comes to a guy that you've worked with for three years, had sex with, spent the night with...
you're telling me you feel nothing?
absolutely nothing?
get away from her! Don't touch her!
I'll kill you if you touch her! -Jasper!
get him off! Ah! He's biting me! Get him off!
what is he gonna do?!
he stopped and looked at him from the top rope.
but now he's scaling!
no way!
somebody better be dying.
Lucy's big brother's got a crush on me so he bit the crap out of chase.
and I care because...?
just thought you might wanna know when one of your employees gets attacked by a sociopath.
bees or monkeys, yes. Sociopaths, no.
doesn't have sense enough to know he wasn't pinned.
he's not a man. He is a monster!
no way!
we gotta take another look at this...
hello. -He's not a sociopath.
how do you know?
he's acting logically.
he's got a crush on you.
he's being aggressive about it.
not just regular aggressive...
he's out-of-his-mind-on-hormones aggressive.
you think he's-- -you better figure out what's killing the girl...
because her brother's got it too.
Jasper's got 100 times more testosterone than a healthy, eight-year-old.
but we scanned his brain and reproductive tract-- no hormone-secreting tumors.
not surprised. What's more likely?
brother and sister get the same type of tumor at exactly the same time or they both play in the same toxic sandbox?
Yes, you would think that if, for some reason, you were completely unaware of the fact we spent the entire night testing everything from that home.
it was all negative.
you went home?
good for you. Delegate.
we're not his subordinates.
making it all the more impressive.
what if it's genetic?
anyone else think it's more than a coincidence these kids have symptoms that could be caused by a brain tumor, which is exactly what killed their mom?
you just said there were no tumors. We scanned both their brains.
they looked clean.
so did their moms, until it didn't.
it can't be genetic.
mom had none of the same symptoms. -Yes, she did.
if the symptoms were pubic hair -and menstruation... -That's ridiculous.
if menstruation is a symptom of brain cancer, than I should be on chemo right now.
that's ridiculous. You're way too skinny to be menstruating.
what if the mom had other problems...
symptoms her doctors ignored on account of the fact she was already dying?
pull all her medical records. Find any similarities to our patients.
punch the little braton the nose so he doesn't have a stroke like his sister -I'm not sick. -Just trying to keep you that way.
I want dr. Cameron to do mine.
trust me. You don't want her cutting you right now.
So...jasper's behavioral issues...
could be a function of the increased testosterone.
hopefully, he'll be a delight as soon as we figure this out.
my tummy hurts! It hurts!
no, it doesn't. Don't be such a baby.
my tummy hurts! -Where in your tummy?
it hurts! It hurts!
stomach pain is from a cyst in her pancreas.
I found two more in her kidneys and one in her lung.
they weren't there 48 hours ago.
the hormones are making her body go haywire.
she gets one in her brain or heart, she's dead.
no pressure though.
mom was perfectly healthy until she got cancer.
she had none of the symptoms the kids have.
it's not genetic. It's not environmental.
it's gotta be a pituitary adenoma.
Yes, that would make complete sense if we had one.
just because we haven't found anything on the scan doesn't mean it's not there
you should remove her pituitary gland.
two siblings, same condition.
it's gotta be genetic or environmental.
we add in the same time and we're back to just environmental.
Yes, and that would make complete sense if there was anything in her environment.
that's 'cause we haven't found anything yet.
she's been out of her environment for four days and she's still getting worse.
I'm getting the father's consent. -No!
we have no evidence.
this is your process, house.
you asked us what two plus two is.
we've eliminated every number except for four.
she needs brain surgery.
the ovaries produce sex hormones in response to a signal from the pituitary gland
since we know the ovaries are fine, the most likely cause
most likely" means she wants to root around inside your little girl's brain without any guarantee that it'll work.
that's why she's holding off on doing your son.
Dr. House knows that unfortunately, we've ruled out every other option.
we need to resect lucy's pituitary before-- -who else visits these kids?
they don't have any family in town. -You got a girlfriend?
no one visits.
school? -They don't go to the same school. House, I've
nanny? -They don't have one.
they go to an after-school day care, but none of the other kids are sick.
yet.
it took your son twice as long to develop symptoms as your daughter.
maybe the other kids are just slow.
we wait and your daughter may die. -She does this, your daughter will need hormone-replacement therapy for the rest of her life
the treatments are extremely effective.
she should lead a relatively normal life.
and isn't that every parent's dream?
to have a kid grow up to be relatively normal?
my husband died of thyroid cancer that metastasized to his brain.
I've been there.
I know how terrifying this can be.
I am telling you that this is your best chance to save your daughter's life.
you did not just play the dead husband card.
my wife died because she signed a consent form that I didn't want her to sign.
died.
thank you.
how did you know?
know what?
that the other kids weren't sick.
you've been here for four days. -I just
I would've heard.
right.
do you have hair on your special place? -Miss janie!
can I help you?
I'm a doctor.
one of your kids are sick and I need to know why.
you think they got sick here?
I think you're dating their dad.
he told you?
no...
and I don't really care why he didn't.
I just need to know how often you go to their house and what you bring.
I don't. -Shampoos, fancy soaps?
kids get in your bag? -I've never been to their house.
they just lost their mom.
and we thought it was too soon.
why are you staring at me?
lip wax?
I just had it done over lunch.
mani-pedi?
No...just the wax.
women get a wax, it's part of the whole self-indulgent, beauty ritual.
pedicure, steam, cucumber masks.
no one runs out of lunch just to get a lip wax, unless you woke up looking like yosemite sam.
you're an ass.
Cameron. -It's always the dad.
excess facial hair in women.
it's a clear sign of hormonal imbalance.
exactly what the little kiddies have.
is there something wrong at the day care center?
there's something wrong in your pants.
she's a lot younger than I am.
I...use A...
male-enhancement cream to keep up with her. What does this have to do
it never occurred to you to get a prescription instead of some pumper loaded with testosterone?
I keep it at the gym.
I apply it daily in the shower just like it says on the bottle.
it's never been in my home. It's obviously never been near the kids.
but you have. -We been through that.
I'm not a pervert or a pedophile!
30% of our waste is excreted through our skin.
that sounds high.
that's why you stink after eating garlic.
Jack waters his bean stalk every day for a week.
he's oozing bean curd out of his pores for a month.
every time you gave the little tykes a hug, you gave them a dose of testosterone.
small for you, but more than their little bodies can handle.
so...I did this to them?
Just...holding their hands? -Uh-huh.
if I stop using it?
you'll be floppy, they'll be fine.
give it back -he'll still be eight.
you okay? -Yeah, I think so.
talk to cuddy? -No, not yet. I don't know what to say
just be straight with her.
I'm not sure what that is.
I can't stop thinking about her.
in what way?
maybe she's right. Maybe...
maybe this is worth exploring.
are you sure that she feels-- -she sent me flowers.
how do i do this? What do I say?
cameron would tell you to say how you feel.
me, I'd get her drunk.
I'm not gonna say anything.
I'm just gonna walk...into her office and I'm gonna kiss her.
that's A...bold move.
Cuddy likes bold.
Yeah, you're right. If you spoke, you'd say something stupid.
Yeah, I mean, I'll either get a girlfriend or get fired.
okay.
Yeah, okay. Okay.
all right.
you! You...you!
you were gonna let me do that?!
you made a compelling argument.
you sent those flowers to me! -Yes, because you took her to a play.
because actually you do want to march down there and kiss her.
no, I don't! -Yes, you do!
you're right.
Seriously? -No.
you're a jerk.
night, wilson. -Night, house.
they're beautiful.
I thought about what you said.
and I really don't want a relationship with you.
I know.
I also know you like flowers.
I don't get the whole may-December thing.
give him a break. It's may-October at worst.
well, why can't it be october-october?
may is when things start to get hot.
if that guy wasn't trying so hard to keep up with a woman half his age, he wouldn't have almost killed both his kids.
guy gets a little something-something... couple of kids have to die...circle of life.
so many people.
so much energy and drama just trying to find someone who's almost never the right person anyway
it just...shouldn't be so hard.
I got tickets to a play.
she almost took my head off!
your fault.You didn't guard your left side.
stop, stop, stop!
Addie... you're bleeding.
I never even hit her.
good morning.
this is funny.
people don't - not done reading. Go away.
most likely she coughed it up, which would mean it's from her lungs.
drugs, toxins, infection?
no fever, no elevated white count, which rules out infection.
and the blood panels found no drugs, no toxins.
the bronchoscopy was pristine. So much for the lungs.
good morning. - Not yet.
so then the blood came from her stomach, which would mean it's an ulcer or a gi bleed.
er also ran an upper and lower gi.
no occult blood in her stool.
which means no ulcer or gi bleed.
which means it's not from the stomach either, which means it didn't come from anywhere.
you guys get to the point where the blood didn't come from anywhere?
rupture in her sinus cavity? Drip through the back?
not that much blood. - Trauma from karate?
no trauma. Kicked the other guy's ass.
now a good time?
if you can tell me how blood can mysteriously appear.
now.
this includes you.
what's going on?
feel free to speculate amongst yourselves.
are you sure?
Yeah. - Why?
he's afraid of turning into me.
well, that's a good enough reason. Sign here.
that's not promising.
good luck.
thank you. - That's it?
you're not gonna tell him that we're a family, and families don't abandon each other?
you want me to? - No.
would it make any difference? - No.
good luck, Dr. Foreman.
so, where were we?
college sophomore coughing up blood.
not the case, the speculation.
the palace intrigue, the rising self-doubts.
did Foreman get a promotion? - I resigned.
what?
personally, I can't believe I've had the same three employees for three years.
the patient could have a heart problem.
Yes, life goes on.
look at the eager beaver combing his hair.
hyperdynamic heart could force too much blood into her lungs.
she coughed up the overflow.
it wouldn't leave a trace in her lungs because it's traveling through normal plumbing.
Foreman, go do a stress echo test to see if he's right.
cameron, check out the dorm, and redo the er labs.
I'll get going on Foreman's farewell party.
everybody good with a mermaid under the stars theme?
so why are you leaving?
or is it just some sort of power play?
you can have my parking space and my locker.
is it about House?
let me get all sensitive and confide in you.
Addie, pedal harder. We need your heart rate at 170.
why wouldn't you want to tell me?
I don't like you. Never have, never will.
you want me to share some more?
even if you do hate me, if you found another job, you'd tell me.
if House did something to drive you out of here, you'd tell me.
the fact that you won't tell me means that whatever the real reason is you're ashamed of it.
guys...
I'm at 170.
pulmonary artery looks good.
it's not a heart problem.
are you cold? - No.
scared? - I'm okay. Why?
on your arm.
addie has goose bumps.
Ooh... no recovering from those babies.
you don't have goose bumps for no reason.
they're a reaction to the body thinking it's cold.
she wasn't cold-- her temperature was normal.
but her body thought it was, which means...
what, a brain problem?
a messed-up hypothalamus could cause goose bumps, but they're not gonna cause her to cough up blood.
she has no neurological issues-- she had a shiver.
I think there's an infection.
we've ruled out infection because no fever, no white count.
I think there's an infection.
blood goes where it's needed. An infection likes nice wet places--her lungs.
start treatment.
all that cool stuff for bacterial, fungal, and atypical infections.
get a lung biopsy.
I want to see the little bugger up close.
why is Foreman quitting? - He wants to breed llamas.
interesting.
you're ashamed of the reason too.
no one writes tamoxifen like you.
well, I use a G.
foreman resigned.
I'm sorry.
it's okay, no biggie. - Right.
he give a reason?
he said he didn't want to end up like me.
I had a brilliant retort.
I can't remember what it was at the moment.
you don't want to end up like you.
good point. Can I resign?
what's up with that?
with what? - You yawned.
I just told you something interesting, so you're not bored.
it's 11: 00 in the morning, you're drinking coffee, so you're not tired.
I didn't yawn, so it's not a mirror-neuron reaction，which leaves symptom.
vasovagal issue.
maybe a heart problem. - My heart's fine. I was up late.
you're just deflecting having a conversation about Foreman.
I'm okay with Foreman leaving.
either you're lying, or you don't really think he's leaving.
or you just jumped right to acceptance.
sorry, I yawned because I was trying to communicate boredom.
you could try bargaining with him-- give him a raise.
how much do you think it would cost to make him want to be like me?
thanks for the coffee.
she seems fine.
she is fine. - She coughed up blood.
past tense. - She has diarrhea.
from the antibiotics for the infection.
lung biopsy says she doesn't have an infection.
well, then you screwed up the biopsy.
or you're wrong about infection.
if I'm wrong, then so is her body,
because it obviously thinks she's got an infection, or it wouldn't have gotten better from the antibiotics.
what is pandiculation symptomatic of?
Yawning's a symptom of fatigue or cholinergic excitation.
does this have anything to do with Addie?
let's say yes. - Cerebral tumor, epilepsy.
could also be a medication reaction to antidepressants, or some meds for end-stage liver failure.
let's say no.
you don't want to leave this job.
three years you've been here, you've never once laughed at anything he's said.
because I wasn't kissing his ass.
but now you are? No.
now you're nervous.
uncomfortable about your decision. It wasn't even that good a joke.
Oh, crap.
most of your jokes are excellent. I just meant in comparison.
shut up. I think she may not have an infection.
we better deal with her before she crashes.
she can't breathe! - Get off the bed.
we need a crash cart.
what's happening? - Let's get her down now.
the pressure's collapsing her lungs. She's not getting any air.
Oh, my god!
she couldn't breathe because she had a pleural effusion.
thoracentesis revealed low protein count.
effusion was transudative, which means she has cirrhosis of the liver, or she's in heart failure.
heart was fine, liver enzymes were normal.
there's something called "blude" in the pleural effusion.
Oh, it's not "blude,"it's blood.
Ha--which is great.
not for her, but for me.
because it means I think it's an infection.
the labs indicated minute traces of blood.
you can't ignore the blood because it's a minority, can you, Foreman?
if we count the traces of blood as significant, the differential isn't just infection.
it could be lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma.
great, go tell her she's got one of those.
or you can tell her that we haven't given her enough antibiotics for her infection.
double the dose, and check her lungs.
we checked her lungs, they're clean.
on the outside.
she needs an arteriogram.
it's about my bowel movements.
what isn't these days?
you sure you want to be here for this? - We do everything together.
of course. The toilet can be a lonely place.
drop your pants, I'll suit up.
they float. - Huh?
my bowel movements.
honey says they're not supposed to.
I'm a nutritionist.
Yes, I could tell from the cool toe-loop sandals.
thank you.
you're welcome.
and the natural-fiber clothing, I assume, means some kind of vegetarian denomination?
we're vegans.
at first I was a little concerned about the lack of protein, but honey showed me you can get it from lots.
well, whatever floats your poop.
and you've been together how long? Six months?
how'd you know?
because after six months, poop love fades.
and if you'd been together shorter than that, then
I'll explain right after this break.
three ten-milligram pills of your finest amphetamines.
arteriogram was normal.
which means her lungs are fine.
what if the clear arteriogram significant?
it is significant. It means there's no infection.
I think there's an infection.
infections don't come and go. People don't get better then worse in the same treatment.
unless your body can't finish out the fight.
maybe goes a couple of rounds, then gives up.
why would it give up? - Maybe its name is Foreman.
come on, where's that smile?
that laugh that makes the whole world sunny without contributing to global warming.
maybe she's missing a protein.
blood panel and enzymes show her proteins are normal.
you can't have tested for every protein.
I can think of at least one you can't test for at all.
complement factor H deficiency.
if she has that, she's dead.
no way to fend off bacteria.
she'll get one infection after another until her body shuts down.
maybe we can get ahead of the game. Manage each symptom as it comes up.
it would give her five miserable years instead of six miserable months.
there's no diagnostic test for complement factor H deficiency.
so we isolate the cells that are yummiest for it.
stick a needle in her eye.
you're cheating on honey.
What?! No, I'm not.
Oh, yes, you are.
it's okay.
I get it.
well, I was gonna say relax, but oddly enough you seem pretty relaxed already.
you're accomplished, you're funny.
you can have whatever you want--women are gonna
he's not cheating with another woman.
he's cheating with another food group.
what?
his floaters float because they're full of fat.
probably had a big cheese burger for lunch.
you're eating flesh? - It's just a hamburger.
not all the time. - You're disgusting!
the soy cakes taste like cardboard.
unsalted cardboard.
I'm accomplished.
I'm funny.
can I... have whatever I want?
can we wait a second?
what's wrong? - I feel good.
do you really need to put that needle
you felt good yesterday, and then you almost suffocated.
and you know that that thing is in my eye?
we think it could be.
if we find it, our hope is that we can treat it.
you hope? - Mom. Don't hang on every word.
he said he hopes. That means he doesn't know.
I just want to understand what's going on.
we won't know anything until we do the test.
Addie, this all looks really scary, but you'll feel nothing. Okay?
okay.
you rang?
you called me.
I bought you an espresso.
you've been buying me coffee for a couple of weeks, I thought I'd pay you back with one.
how did you walk with the cane and the two coffees?
why are you suspicious?
because it's either that or accept the fact that you've done something nice.
and then I have to deal with the horsemen and the rain of fire and the end of days.
you think I spat in yours?
or worse.
I stacked them.
what do you think of me hiring a nutritionist instead of a neurologist?
they sound almost the same.
I take it you've met a hot nutritionist.
don't cheapen this.
we had an in-depth conversation about proteins and fats.
I was about to examine her boyfriend's rectum.
you asked for a date while your finger was in her boyfriend?
got her number.
no, no. No way.
this is an employment application.
she doesn't want to go out with you, she's looking for a job.
Oh, god, she's 26.
with the wisdom of a much younger woman.
have you spoken to Foreman?
several times. We laugh
you're gonna lose him.
and that will be depressing...
and will only make me appreciate all the good things that I do have.
macular biopsy was negative, which means you're wrong.
there's no complement factor H deficiency.
the most likely cause of altering blood flow in the brain is a clot or a tumor.
we can rule out a clotting issue because she has a bleeding issue.
which means we should be looking for a tumor.
I think there's an infection.
just because the cells in her eye aren't dead yet, doesn't mean they're working.
so why did we do the test?
because if it had been positive, it would have proved I was right.
but negative doesn't prove you wrong.
that's the beauty of the test.
she needs an MRI of her brain.
Absolutely.
as long as you're scanning, you mind having a boo for an abscess, or something caused by an infection?
I didn't expect House to beg me to stay, but it seems like he's in a better mood since I quit.
nothing in the axial view.
you haven't asked me why I'm leaving.
I figured you'd tell me when you wanted to.
I don't want to be like him.
you're not a jerk.
thank you.
I mean, sometimes you are.
but I don't think we can pin that on House.
and you're a better doctor than when you came through the door.
I'm better at some things, worse at others.
again, not House's fault. It's a job.
you're supposed to take the good, and leave the bad.
it's easier for you.
why, because you think I need to toughen up?
you think I'm weak?
Yeah.
see, I am a jerk. I've gotta get out of here.
what's wrong, Addie?
my head hurts!
brain's clean. No tumor and no abscess.
we're all wrong.
my head!
my head!
Grody!
looks like massive tissue death.
who cares-her head blew up. How cool is that.
it's not pussy meaning you don't think it's an infection.
and you'd be right, if you weren't wrong.
here we go again.
she's got infections that come and go, which means...
it means it has to be something else.
good guess, but no.
it means either she's got a leprechaun in her colon, which is playing with the doggy door, letting bacteria in and out.
or she's got complement factor H deficiency.
are you enjoying this?
I'm saving a woman's life!
I'm saving a woman's life!
actually, I'm diagnosing her.
technically I'm diagnosing her with something that's gonna kill her, but other than that I am saving her life.
an autoimmune problem makes more sense.
you can't explain a transudative pleural effusion with giant cell arteritis.
you'd need three white boards and 100 different-colored markers.
no, it's much more likely she has an invisible protein that allowed bacteria to arbitrarily invade her lungs, then arbitrarily invade her pleura, then arbitrarily jump into her head.
if it's autoimmune, she can live.
but we have to give her steroids now, before her heart ruptures.
if you're wrong and you give her steroids, she dies now.
Foreman, you want a rundown on how it feels to go with your gut and kill a person?
we can get into the whole spiring out of control, self-doubt, resigning thing.
do it.
the worst that can happen is you quit.
cameron, want to explain to the parents why you'll be holding paddles while he's doing it?
because if her heart goes boom, it'll boom right away.
she really has to be awake for this?
if there's a problem, she can tell us what she feels.
relax.
we're scared.
I don't want you to be scared.
then get better.
okay, sweetie?
we love you.
I'm sorry.
ready?
ready.
my patient's about to have a heart attack.
it's gonna be massive.
Oh, well, that's too bad Because I just got tickets to a stroke on the third floor.
have you had a conversation with Foreman?
do me a favor.
you haven't... because then you would have to confront your own emotions.
is bile an emotion?
because I could definitely feel something here.
get me some licorice.
this is gonna be the best heart attack of all time.
Oh, it, wait, wait.
she's gonna shock her.
there's always tomorrow.
you wanted to see me?
pretty sure the label is straight.
are you really gonna leave?
where are you going? You lined up interviews yet?
I'm not sure.
you're pissed at House - I get it. You're symbolicating killing him.
Symbolicating? What?
Symbolic-a-lating-gosh, that's a hard word.
are you okay?
Hey, I'm not the one sym - I'm not the one symb.
I'm not the one pretending to kill someone. What would it take for you to stay? Is it money?
he wants you to stay. - He said that?
if I said he said that, would that make a difference?
are you sure you're okay? - Hello?
Ugh, I'm leaving now.
I'm late for a breast thing. You know he wants you.
you know he's good; you know he can make you good.
I don't know what I'm saying. You don't - I don't
you know what I'm saying and you know I'm right. I gotta go.
sorry it took me so long to get down here.
I'm Dr. Wilson. I guess Dr. Stein's gone. Don't worry about it.
I'll talk to him when we're done.
Dr. Stein said they're probably calcium deposits.
well, with your medical history you don't want to take any chances.
I can't seem to put on my gloves today. It's weird.
okay, well... that's fine. One's enough. Well, let's have a look.
you sure talk fast.
this is nothing. You should see me when we're busy.
I just winked at you. I just - I've never winked at a patient in my life.
I have no - I am so sorry. I have no idea what I was thinking.
it's okay.
no, it's not. I was hitting on you. I wasn't consciously hitting on you, but what else could you think?
that you were being reassuring?
Yeah, that would make sense. On the other hand, I feel like my heart's gonna explode.
are you okay?
I feel a little sweaty. Am I sweating?
Yeah.
is something wrong?
I can't - I can't.
I put on gloves to do a breast exam - perfect. Sorry.
it's 185.
excuse me, I have to go kill someone.
you dosed me!
Yes, I did.
but only because you didn't trust me, your best friend.
you could have killed me!
amphetamines aren't gonna kill you.
you don't know my medical history. I - I could have.
you could have given me a heart attack.
a heart attack is not gonna kill you. You were in a hospital.
a- ha! You yawned.
a- ha...
you tried to kill me.
I put you on uppers, and you still yawned.
means it's a symptom of being a big, fat liar.
yawning is a side effect of some anti-depressants
apparently the ones you're on.
I'm not on anti-depressants; I'm on speed.
that means it's a symptom of cerebral tumor. You got six weeks to live.
Mr. Well - adjusted is as messed up as the rest of us.
why would you keep that a secret? Are you ashamed of recognizing how pathetic your life is?
it's not a secret, House! It's-it's
it's personal!
how long has it been personal?
it's personal!
Yawning's recent, so either you just started or you changed prescriptions.
this is why I take them.
they're anti-depressants. Not anti-annoyance-ants.
you'd think this would naturally come up in conversation.
Oh, don't act hurt. You don't care.
on one of those occasions when you're pompously lecturing me on what to do to fix my life.
you wouldn't take them.
you'd rather od on vicodin or stick electrodes in your head because you could say you did it to get high.
the only reason to take anti-depressants is because you're depressed.
you have to admit that you're depressed.
gimme.
are you gonna admit that - nope.
I'm gonna prove that I'm not depressed.
well, I can't give you my prescription. You've got to meet with a psychiatrist.
you need a whole work-up.
give me a vicodin so I don't stroke.
I... wouldn't drink that.
my leg hurt, and I...
why didn't you pick up the phone? We've been calling.
I was sleeping.
what did you do?
nothing.
this is how regular people look when you wake them up.
chase was wrong.
addie's kidneys shut down.
hemolytic uremic syndrome shut down Addie's kidneys.
peripheral smear of red cells had schistocytes.
huh.
hus is usually caused by an infection or a protein deficiency.
what a coincidence.
I know a patient with an infection and a protein deficiency.
you think it's possible there's a connection?
I want to hear you say it, Chase. It will please me.
doesn't mean you're right. You predicted cardiac arrest- instant cardiac arrest.
there were only two choices.
since yours was wrong, mine must've been right.
either that or we missed the leprechaun.
if you're right, there's nothing to be done.
the steroid treatment we gave her means when the next infection hits, it'll hit hard.
liver failure, cardiac arrest
on the bright side, it confirms my diagnosis.
don't you see how incredible this call was?
a protein deficiency.
can't be tested, can't be seen.
I called it based on coughing blood.
you're happy about this.
she's going to die.
that's not my fault.
she's gonna die anyway.
but now, thanks to me, at least she'll know why.
I'm sure you'll see that gratitude in her eyes when you tell her.
I'm not telling her.
no one's telling her. Not 'til we're sure I'm right.
but we're gonna wait for her to stroke or have a heart attack to confirm before we tell her.
seems like the humane approach.
her heart went into v-fib.
brought her back. Barely.
Congratulations. You have your confirmation.
what's her name?
who? The co-ed? - Sure.
dead sophomore girl?
you know her father's name? - Dad. Her mother's name is mommy.
Ben and Jodie are about to lose their only daughter, Addie.
you think they're gonna give a crap if I know their names?
five years from now when the father's looking at photographs of his daughter graduating from high school they're not gonna remember the nice black doctor who called them by their first name.
you don't wanna quit.
you saying you don't want me to quit? - Didn't sound like I said that.
I'm saying that suddenly you're trying to turn me into a kinder, gentler ass.
because you know who you are.
and you figure if you can make me decent and caring, then maybe there's a hope for you
you are about to tell a girl she's dying. And you think it's about you.
God, I hope I'm not you.
I'm sorry.
Addie, you're dying.
are you sure? - Yes.
your infections will get worse. The toxins will spill into your blood.
how long? - Two days...Maybe less.
you have a condition called- - it doesn't matter.
it's, um, a very rare protein deficiency- -I don't want to hear it.
okay.
it's what's killing you. This is what's killing you.
you're not interested in what's killing you?
will that make any difference? Will I live any longer?
please, could you just leave?
what's the point of living without curiosity? Without craving the
so I'm screwing up my last few hours because I won't listen to you?
get out of here. - It's--it's--it's like the...
dark matter in the universe. - You're smiling.
no, I'm not.
you can only diagnose a problem by looking at what's --missing.
Oh, god. I have to go.
nineteen-year-old didn't want to hear the coolest explanation of why she's gonna die.
begged me to shut up.
if you can't shut up, at least talk quietly.
amphetamine withdrawal's a bitch. She thought that I was happy.
you were happy. - No, I was hazy.
I don't get hazy on vicodin or anything else I throw down.
which means I was throwing down something I didn't know I was throwing down.
which got me to wondering... Why didn't you give me those happy pills?
I told you; you gotta be checked out- -no, you just didn't want me double dosing.
you dosed me! Those coffees
they worked. You've been smiling. Relaxed...Happy.
a dying girl thought I was happy.
a moron thought I was happy. Who the hell doesn't want to know why she's dying?
house was happy. - Hazy.
happy. - Hazy!
Oh, right, a dying girl mistook hazy for happy.
because dying people see happiness everywhere.
she's miserable. - She wasn't miserable.
of course she was miserable.
you just told her she- - she's no different than she'd ever been.
she's no different than she'd ever been.
Oh, god. I gotta go.
I need a minute with your daughter.
Dr. House, get out of here before- - she's gonna live.
does that help? Now get out.
are you jerking us around? - Get out!
You...Have got leprechauns in ya.
depression manifests in lots of different ways.
some people can't get out of bed all day.
others have serial relationships and become oncologists.
I'm dying; I'm not depressed. - Wrong and wrong.
you tried to kill yourself by throwing down kitchen cleanser.
now, most normal suicidal morons would've just drank the stuff.
burn the hell out of their mouth and throat. Painful, but not deadly.
but being a college-educated, suicidal moron, you wrapped it in gel caps or gum which left no trace.
it burned a hole in your intestine.
but the body can repair almost anything... Which is cool.
in your case, scar tissue closed up the hole.
but it also formed a bridge between a vein and an artery.
now, veins are supposed to help the intestine flush bacteria away.
but the bridge allowed the bacteria entrance to the artery where they got a free ride everywhere.
can you fix me?
surgery can fix the bridge. Take about two hours.
Psychotherapy's gonna take you a little longer.
why'd you do it?
I don't know.
I just...have never been happy.
please don't tell my parents.
they'll blame themselves, and it's not their fault.
please, you can't tell them.
technically, all you have to do is promise me that you won't do it again.
then legally, I can't tell them.
I promise.
Yeah. Sure.
we can't thank you enough- - your daughter tried to kill herself.
that's why she's here.
legally, I'm supposed to keep that between me and her.
which makes sense. She's obviously an adult.
capable of her own well-reasoned decisions.
you're sure?
if she doesn't die in the next couple of hours... Yeah, I'm right.
how could she hide this?
everyone has secrets.
we'll take care of her. Figure it out.
make her happy? - Get her into therapy.
might want to try some meds too.
can we call you? If we have any questions.
no.
Sup? - Nothing.
you wanted to see me? - Yeah.
house's patient.
Yeah, the one that would have died if not for him.
subtle. - Thanks.
you're really scared you'll turn into him.
don't tell me I'm better than him. Don't tell me take the good, leave the bad.
cameron already tried.
I'm telling you there are worse things to turn into.
it's not worth it.
I didn't think you were gonna show. - Sorry.
surgery went a little late.
so you really think I have all the necessary qualifications?
I can't discuss this with a dry mouth. What do you got there?
peppermint tea.
I'm going to have a mug of peppermint tea, please.
this isn't a job interview, is it?
it's some kind of interview.
you're judging me, I'm judging you.
you have the upper hand. I don't know anything about you.
I'm on anti-depressants because a doctor friend of mine thinks I'm miserable.
I don't like them. They make me hazy. I eat meat. I like drugs.
and I'm not always faithful to the women I date.
you don't seem depressed.
you do realize you just skipped over several deep character flaws that most women would run screaming from.
you told the truth. - Yeah.
I don't always do that either.
well, how miserable can you be saving lives, sleeping around, and doing drugs?
were you on the debating team in high school?
Also...I hate...Tea.
she almost took my head off!
your fault.You didn't guard your left side.
stop, stop, stop!
Addie... you're bleeding.
I never even hit her.
good morning.
this is funny.
people don't - not done reading. Go away.
most likely she coughed it up, which would mean it's from her lungs.
drugs, toxins, infection?
no fever, no elevated white count, which rules out infection.
and the blood panels found no drugs, no toxins.
the bronchoscopy was pristine. So much for the lungs.
good morning. - Not yet.
so then the blood came from her stomach, which would mean it's an ulcer or a gi bleed.
er also ran an upper and lower gi.
no occult blood in her stool.
which means no ulcer or gi bleed.
which means it's not from the stomach either, which means it didn't come from anywhere.
you guys get to the point where the blood didn't come from anywhere?
rupture in her sinus cavity? Drip through the back?
not that much blood. - Trauma from karate?
no trauma. Kicked the other guy's ass.
now a good time?
if you can tell me how blood can mysteriously appear.
now.
this includes you.
what's going on?
feel free to speculate amongst yourselves.
are you sure?
Yeah. - Why?
he's afraid of turning into me.
well, that's a good enough reason. Sign here.
that's not promising.
good luck.
thank you. - That's it?
you're not gonna tell him that we're a family, and families don't abandon each other?
you want me to? - No.
would it make any difference? - No.
good luck, Dr. Foreman.
so, where were we?
college sophomore coughing up blood.
not the case, the speculation.
the palace intrigue, the rising self-doubts.
did Foreman get a promotion? - I resigned.
what?
personally, I can't believe I've had the same three employees for three years.
the patient could have a heart problem.
Yes, life goes on.
look at the eager beaver combing his hair.
hyperdynamic heart could force too much blood into her lungs.
she coughed up the overflow.
it wouldn't leave a trace in her lungs because it's traveling through normal plumbing.
Foreman, go do a stress echo test to see if he's right.
cameron, check out the dorm, and redo the er labs.
I'll get going on Foreman's farewell party.
everybody good with a mermaid under the stars theme?
so why are you leaving?
or is it just some sort of power play?
you can have my parking space and my locker.
is it about House?
let me get all sensitive and confide in you.
Addie, pedal harder. We need your heart rate at 170.
why wouldn't you want to tell me?
I don't like you. Never have, never will.
you want me to share some more?
even if you do hate me, if you found another job, you'd tell me.
if House did something to drive you out of here, you'd tell me.
the fact that you won't tell me means that whatever the real reason is you're ashamed of it.
guys...
I'm at 170.
pulmonary artery looks good.
it's not a heart problem.
are you cold? - No.
scared? - I'm okay. Why?
on your arm.
addie has goose bumps.
Ooh... no recovering from those babies.
you don't have goose bumps for no reason.
they're a reaction to the body thinking it's cold.
she wasn't cold-- her temperature was normal.
but her body thought it was, which means...
what, a brain problem?
a messed-up hypothalamus could cause goose bumps, but they're not gonna cause her to cough up blood.
she has no neurological issues-- she had a shiver.
I think there's an infection.
we've ruled out infection because no fever, no white count.
I think there's an infection.
blood goes where it's needed. An infection likes nice wet places--her lungs.
start treatment.
all that cool stuff for bacterial, fungal, and atypical infections.
get a lung biopsy.
I want to see the little bugger up close.
why is Foreman quitting? - He wants to breed llamas.
interesting.
you're ashamed of the reason too.
no one writes tamoxifen like you.
well, I use a G.
foreman resigned.
I'm sorry.
it's okay, no biggie. - Right.
he give a reason?
he said he didn't want to end up like me.
I had a brilliant retort.
I can't remember what it was at the moment.
you don't want to end up like you.
good point. Can I resign?
what's up with that?
with what? - You yawned.
I just told you something interesting, so you're not bored.
it's 11: 00 in the morning, you're drinking coffee, so you're not tired.
I didn't yawn, so it's not a mirror-neuron reaction，which leaves symptom.
vasovagal issue.
maybe a heart problem. - My heart's fine. I was up late.
you're just deflecting having a conversation about Foreman.
I'm okay with Foreman leaving.
either you're lying, or you don't really think he's leaving.
or you just jumped right to acceptance.
sorry, I yawned because I was trying to communicate boredom.
you could try bargaining with him-- give him a raise.
how much do you think it would cost to make him want to be like me?
thanks for the coffee.
she seems fine.
she is fine. - She coughed up blood.
past tense. - She has diarrhea.
from the antibiotics for the infection.
lung biopsy says she doesn't have an infection.
well, then you screwed up the biopsy.
or you're wrong about infection.
if I'm wrong, then so is her body, 'cause it obviously thinks she's got an infection, or it wouldn't have gotten better from the antibiotics.
what is pandiculation symptomatic of?
Yawning's a symptom of fatigue or cholinergic excitation.
does this have anything to do with Addie?
let's say yes. - Cerebral tumor, epilepsy.
could also be a medication reaction to antidepressants, or some meds for end-stage liver failure.
let's say no.
you don't want to leave this job.
three years you've been here, you've never once laughed at anything he's said.
because I wasn't kissing his ass.
but now you are? No.
now you're nervous.
uncomfortable about your decision. It wasn't even that good a joke.
Oh, crap.
most of your jokes are excellent. I just meant in comparison.
shut up. I think she may not have an infection.
we better deal with her before she crashes.
she can't breathe! - Get off the bed.
we need a crash cart.
what's happening? - Let's get her down now.
the pressure's collapsing her lungs. She's not getting any air.
Oh, my god!
she couldn't breathe because she had a pleural effusion.
thoracentesis revealed low protein count.
effusion was transudative, which means she has cirrhosis of the liver, or she's in heart failure.
heart was fine, liver enzymes were normal.
there's something called "blude" in the pleural effusion.
Oh, it's not "blude,"it's blood.
Ha--which is great.
not for her, but for me.
because it means I think it's an infection.
the labs indicated minute traces of blood.
you can't ignore the blood because it's a minority, can you, Foreman?
if we count the traces of blood as significant, the differential isn't just infection.
it could be lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma.
great, go tell her she's got one of those.
or you can tell her that we haven't given her enough antibiotics for her infection.
double the dose, and check her lungs.
we checked her lungs, they're clean.
on the outside.
she needs an arteriogram.
it's about my bowel movements.
what isn't these days?
you sure you want to be here for this? - We do everything together.
of course. The toilet can be a lonely place.
drop your pants, I'll suit up.
they float. - Huh?
my bowel movements.
honey says they're not supposed to.
I'm a nutritionist.
Yes, I could tell from the cool toe-loop sandals.
thank you.
you're welcome.
and the natural-fiber clothing, I assume, means some kind of vegetarian denomination?
we're vegans.
at first I was a little concerned about the lack of protein, but honey showed me you can get it from lots.
well, whatever floats your poop.
and you've been together how long? Six months?
how'd you know?
because after six months, poop love fades.
and if you'd been together shorter than that, then
I'll explain right after this break.
three ten-milligram pills of your finest amphetamines.
arteriogram was normal.
which means her lungs are fine.
what if the clear arteriogram significant?
it is significant. It means there's no infection.
I think there's an infection.
infections don't come and go. People don't get better then worse in the same treatment.
unless your body can't finish out the fight.
maybe goes a couple of rounds, then gives up.
why would it give up? - Maybe its name is Foreman.
come on, where's that smile?
that laugh that makes the whole world sunny without contributing to global warming.
maybe she's missing a protein.
blood panel and enzymes show her proteins are normal.
you can't have tested for every protein.
I can think of at least one you can't test for at all.
complement factor H deficiency.
if she has that, she's dead.
no way to fend off bacteria.
she'll get one infection after another until her body shuts down.
maybe we can get ahead of the game. Manage each symptom as it comes up.
it would give her five miserable years instead of six miserable months.
there's no diagnostic test for complement factor H deficiency.
so we isolate the cells that are yummiest for it.
stick a needle in her eye.
you're cheating on honey.
What?! No, I'm not.
Oh, yes, you are.
it's okay.
