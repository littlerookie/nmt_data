which you play so well. Thank you.
to travel to the year 1937,
it is a list of all of the past equestrianism winners.
it is a list of electronic components for a nuclear device.
it is a list of names, it should be garbage of the wedding.
it is a literary device that can effectively help bracket and, thus, organize and facilitate orderly expression of thoughts.
it is a literary interpretation rather than true textual research. No explanation of history is without bias.
it is a little - known fact that even when you're not having fun,
it is a little absurd, though.
it is a little bit forgettable. It is fun and young.
it is a little bit out of hand. It can be.
it is a little bit tarnished.
which you probabIy can't even see, 'cause it's so deep in the ear canal.
to travel. I like travelling!
seriously. We're gonna get you help.
and my temple accepts donations.
and my therapist says that I seek stability through relationships.
and my thesis was that our readers are odder than you'd think.
and my thing became weak sine then
and my thing is, see, I can make the stuff.
and my thing isn't tiny. It's average, so.
and my thought was, anyone in on the ground floor stands to profit hugely,
and my thoughts fly apart can this man be believed? Shall his sins be forgiven? Shall his crimes be reprieved?
and my three Easter rabbits
which you probably all think I am, anyway.
and my three Easter rabbits... No. Just the big things.
which you probably can't even see, 'cause it's so deep in the ear canal.
no, no. I'm a mail delivery man.
no, no. I'm a mug. I'm a cunt.
no, no. I'm a photographer.
no, no. I'm a supervisor now.
no, no. I'm afraid not.
no, no. I'm all grey and old. Great to see you.
no, no. I'm all over this.
no, no. I'm all right.
no, no. I'm already pregnant.
no, no. I'm an analyst. I don't go on missions.

I did. Well, I didn't hear you.
which you probably don't want to talk about, because she's your baby sister.
which you probably know, since I'm David stachowski.
which you probably say no to, so she scrunches.
which you promised the IRS, in writing,
which you really shouldn't have done.
which you refused to go because you're so busy...
which you said was a dream come true.
which you said you had never seen.
which you said you'd replace and you never did.
which you see here; my favorite amphitheater. The Colosseum is more famous.
and my three boys in particular.
I did. Well, I think you missed some.
can I help you? - Yeah. Thanks.
