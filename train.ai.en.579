the keynesian answer lies in the creation of an international institutional structure that would set the framework within which market forces can find the most efficient solution.
the keynesian approach is ill-suited to this kind of sustained economic management, which needs to be on a timescale of 10-20 years, involving co-operation between public and private investments, and national and local governments.
