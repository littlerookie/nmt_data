nothing is like it was.
Hey, man.
did you sleep in your car?
you did?
my dad kicked me out last night.
I left a bowl of soup on the table, and he told me to hit it.
that's insane.
Yeah.
his dad's got a little...
hurricane damage.
Yeah, my brother, too.
they both came back after the storm and were like, "hey...
what do we need our family for?
I'm just afraidthey're gonna toss my mom out on the street next.
better than tossing her in the water.
that's what kira's dad did to my mother. right, kir?
he didn't do it on purpose.
it just... happened.
right, it just...
Tom just happened to te my mom to the water in the middle yeah, just stop it, jesse. all right?
stop it.
see you around, brett.
sorry.
survival"-- an elemental word, yet it means different things to different people.
to some, it may imply mere existence.
to others, superiority.
to some, peace. others, war.
but to us, it just means the future.
we've all been changed for a reason
a reason that will become clear to us in the coming days.
but for now, it is incumbent that we maintain our unified community, that we believe in the vision of our leaders...
well, at least now we know where everyone is.
When'd they get an infomercial?
and as mr. szura writes in his book, we were able to adapt...
you think she's talking about that, um, robin hood cambrian thing?
I mean, virtually overnight, all kinds of new life appeared.
of what it is to exist...
what, do you think that's what's going on here?
you don't have to be an alien to wipe out a species, dave.
humans are pretty good at it, too.
we are all here because we were able to adapt...
so these hybridsre...
they're just another invasive species?
like the rabbits taking over australia?
melaleuca trees in the glades?
that would be the best case scenario.
what's the worst case?
that they're actually our next evolutionary upgrade.
like we're neanderthals...
and they're us?
maybe we should ask the priest.
sheriff tom underlay. i'm here to see colonel lopez.
she expecting you, sheriff?
no.
well, i'm sorry, sir, but without the prior clearance
get the clearance.
I'll wait.
right down the middle.
do it again. you can't do it again.
good. it's good. that was short. that was short, though.
there we go.
try again. you can't do it again. okay.
and another score.
all right. all right. cool.
okay, the kick is up...
sweet! extra point for the head shot.
man, i'm sorry, dude.
you know, maybe you guys should play somewhere else.
I'm sorry. are we bothering you?
cause last time i checked, this was a public place.
but if you've got a problem, maybe you should get out of here.
why don't you just take it outside?
damn it, that's my report.
why don't you clean that up, man?
what did you say?
you knocked over the man's drink.
why don't you clean it up?
Oh, look at this.
do you wanna go? come on, bring it, freak.
that's enough, guys. you can either all sit down in here, or you can sit with the principal.
it's okay, miss currie.
Oh, i'm sorry. yes.
I'm sure you can all work this out.
now... who wants to go?
you scream, and i'll cut your throat.
Where's szura?
I don't know.
Yes, you do. come on, get up. you're gonna take us to him.
for as long as we're the minority, "people will want to persecute us.
so we must live apart until our numbers are large enough to make a stand.
what "stand" is your leader talking about, huh?
he's not my leader.
so you're not one of his little merry men?
what's with this whole robin hood thing anyway?
is he planning some kind of big "steal from the rich, "give back to the poor" raid or something?
I have no idea.
how did you get here?
the sheriff sent me.
Why?
because i shot him.
you shot underlay?
how about that? a fallen priest.
why did you do it?
because he misled me.
but now i know differently.
and tom knew all along.
so what do you think saved you?
evil.
I don't think he's gonna like your theory much better.
you wanted your man, i got him for you.
but i'm confused about a couple things
when did he get back from iraq?
a few months ago. why?
well, you've got such a small hospital here, i figured, you know, you'd send him to the v. a. in miami.
is this what you came here to discuss, sheriff?
major.
excuse me?
well, if you're gonna make this formal, i retired as a major, colonel.
I did a little research on the way out here.
lieutenant william blount was a sonde operator for a c-130 weather plane out of biloxi.
that plane disappeared during the hurricane, and you yourself told me that you sent a search and rescue team to look for them, which was also lost.
three crewmen died.
half bleeding to death because he was attacked by something in the water.
his name was paxton, and when i told you that he was at homestead hospital, you asked to help get him back to you, which i did.
what happened to that man, colonel?
that's classified.
you also told me that you were worried about bad publicity then, too.
but i don't think you need to worry about the press anymore.
I think you should be far more concerned about me.
how many more crew members from that weather plane do you have locked in this place?
all of them.
we should be covered for tonight.
I'll see who's on call.
Hey, kira. why aren't you in school?
it's lunch. got a second?
uh... let me know if you're still short.
what's up?
I'm worried about jesse. i saw him this morning.
has he said anything to you?
about what?
he's pretty upset about it.
he thinks that dad did it on purpose...
to make you, you know, like him.
when did you tell him this?
yesterday. i thought he already knew.
I was actually trying to make him feel better.
I'll talk to him.
can you do it soon?
cause things are really weird at school right now.
which side"?
Yeah.
I'm just worried that jesse's in such a bad place right now, that whatever side he chooses is gonna be the wrong one.
that's szura's tent, but he may not be here.
he comes and goes to the mainland a lot.
there's no guards. no vehicles either.
there still may be a phone, though.
I don't care about a phone, dave.
I want szura, and i want him now.
just follow me and be quiet.
I don't think he's here.
he's got underlay's whole life in here.
the guy's a big fan.
Oh, wow. it's a war room.
he's got maps of every county in florida.
has szura told you what he and underlay ultimately hope to achieve here?
no.
how many people are on the island?
I don't know. a hundred?
what does he think he's gonna do with a hundred people?
I think evolution might be a little too slow for this guy, russ.
I think szura might be planning a little cambrian explosion of his own.
what are you talking about?
Russell believes that what's happened to you, what's happened to all these people, may be some kind of radical evolution.
I'm sure you have some quibble with that, but...
I... i never even considered it.
well, i'm not surprised.
Oh, no, no. i...
I'm not one of those people who believe that god and evolution are mutually exclusive.
like everything else in the universe, i believe that evolution was part of god's plan.
but... could it really be possible?
at this point, i wouldn't rule out anything.
Hey, russ.
it's a phone. it's a sat phone.
look, if we call in the troops, there's no going back.
the world's gonna know about everything that's happening in our town.
you...
and my kids...
they may lose their mother for good.
we don't have a choice, russ.
he's killed too many people.
make the call.
come on.
he could back here any second.
you don't really wanna face off alone with him.
Yes, islamorada station?
Yeah, this is florida parks ranger russell varon.
I need immediate coast guard assistance.
well, thank you, miss hundeen.
and again, i'm so sorry about all this.
it's all right. we've all been under a lot of stress lately.
the transition's been tough on everyone.
but we're gonna move on now. right, jesse?
what about the other kids?
Scott and greg
aren't you gonna talk to them, too?
of course.
but from what i understand, they didn't initiate this.
that's not true.
so not fair.
why did this happen?
because they're hybrid bastards, mom.
and it wasn't our fault.
what were they doing?
acting...
like they were better than us, which, well, i guess is true. right, mom?
I mean, isn't that why tom made you one?
Tom didn't make me anything.
Oh. right, i forgot.
you're on the other side now, so...
how am i ever gonna get a serious answer from you?
Hey, jesse! come here.
I am on your side.
no, you're not.
you're not even my mother.
your husband killed you.
so do me a favor. okay, mariel?
do me a favor and--and--and stop pretending that anything's ever gonna be the way it was again.
because it can't be.
you're not my mother.
you may find what i'm about to show you disturbing.
but i promise, we're all patriots here.
would you like to know what's in them?
sergeant, could you bring one down to the lab for us, please?
did you know those two kids that szura shot?
not really.
the young woman was pregnant.
why would he kill a pregnant woman?
if his goal is to build a majority, wouldn't he want all the people here having babies?
Yeah.
that might not be on his timetable right now.
or underlay's.
it's hard to lead an army while you're pushing a baby carriage.
Hey, they're here.
why are there two boats?
who's that guy in the little one?
how long has this operation been running?
since '96.
that's the same year your plane crashed, isn't it?
so you've been aware of these changes in people since '96?
well, not at this level. it's grown over time.
with each new hurricane, we've learned more.
but when we found the crew from this weather plane and discovered that they were all still alive...
well, you can imagine how excited we were.
what are you doing with them?
testing them.
and they've been incredible.
they've shown remarkable resiliency.
like you, after the shooting.
they really are amazing creatures.
they aren't "creatures.
I'm sorry, tom.
I meant no disrespect.
a lot of our funding has gone into testing, but even more has gone into cleanup.
in order to keep a project of this size under wraps, we've had to cover a lot of ground.
and... as i guess you know, each new being leaves a rather large footprint.
thank you, sergeant.
it's a lot to comprehend, isn't it?
so you knew about me since '96?
no, we just found out recently.
I've always considered you a loyal partner, tom.
what factions?
just know that everything that is happening here i am my community. what factions are you talking about?
the ones that would have you in here, if you push this you mr. varon? yeah.
we got your call.
what are you doing with him?
we picked mr. dennison up on the other side of the island.
murder's a pretty serious charge, sir.
and if one of his people has committed a crime
he committed the crime.
his name's not dennison. it's szura.
I'm afraid u're wrong about that, sir.
Mr. dennison runs a relief center here for the victims of the recent storm.
were you a victim of the recent storm, lieutenant?
where are these bodies you called in about?
they were right here.
they were right here!
you know, ranger, what community is that?
huh?
what community?
the community that supports the killing of innocent people?
the community that would take a mother away from her own children?
that community?
a community like him?
are you like him, or are you just on his payroll?
because either way, you're no better than he is.
will you be needing an escort, mr. varon?
why don't you let him come with us?
it's all right, russell.
whatever happens, it's all right.
so, father...
perhaps you'd like to stop by my house for a little confessional.
Mrs. wade says you're doing very well in spelling.
Yeah. yeah?
and i got all my words right.
all your words?
the hardest one is "united states,
because it's actually two words.
that's great, rose.
I bet your dad is gonna be so proud of you.
what was that?
Rosie, i want you to go inside and wait for me, okay?
and i will be right there.
okay.
what are you doing?
shooting.
I'm not too good, but...
where did you get that gun?
daddy tom.
Tom gave you that?
Yeah. wasn't he thoughtful?
you've been in a fight.
and you've been drinking.
what are you shooting at?
these are pictures of your family.
not my family.
no. you're more my family than they're my family.
and you're not even my family. you're just my dad's wife.
give me the gun.
no way.
now!
I'm sorry.
you can have the beer, but...
gun's mine
this ring is beautiful, it suits you
it isn't too flashy for everyday wear
it's our last pair
Chun, take a shot of this ring
tell me, which do you like best?
I like this best but there's no discount for this
this one is nice too, there's a 20% discount
the first one is better, but it's too expensive
the second one is not bad, its design is nice
it's hard to make a choice
take that one, just as you said
I want the most expensive pair
the ones without discount?
it doesn't matter. It's once in a lifetime,
I promise you won't regret it
what was that?
bomb! Bomb! Run!

what do you want now?
I've said it many times before
I didn't kill my wife
bugger off if you don't have enough evidence
pour a glass of wine for the Inspector
you've probably never tasted a $30, 000 bottle of wine
poor cops rarely taste the fine things in life
the wine is no good, it reeks of blood
if you have evidence, arrest me.
otherwise, don't mess with me!
yesterday we arrested the murderer you hired in Macau
next time, don't hire gamblers
look for yourself
the whole thing costs $300, 000

listen to me, we risked our lives
but we won't allow others to risk it for us

I asked you if you were the ones that robbed the truck

is there nothing to do at the police station?
now leave here! - We're leaving, sir.
get out!
how are the others?
Chun was stabbed three times.
he's still in critical condition
the other men should be discharged in a couple of days
don't get mad, I made you some soup
soup? Who asked you to make soup?
have you checked out the robbers like I asked?
we're looking into it but I want to see how you are first
what's there to see? There's nothing to see.
can't even get some information, and you say you're from intelligence
why don't you go?
go
fellow officers, the Chief is very concerned about the two officers
the purpose of this meeting is to see how we can nab the culprits
you have the details of Tien Yeng Seng
tien Yeng Seng is the mastermind, Tien Yeng Yee is next in line
they are suspects in an armed bank robbery 6 months ago
they got away with US $100 million
according to intelligence from Interpol
thai police, Vietnam and Cambodia have all been after them
they surfaced again in Hong Kong last night
they grew up together in flames of war
after finishing their military training
they formed a mercenary gang and created havoc
until the last time when we took down three of them
OK, this operation will be under SP Law and Wong
chief Inspector Sam will be assisting in the investigation
Yes, sir
actually I have already applied for early retirement
with vacation time, it'll only be about a month
sir, let me handle it
these men committed a crime in my district
good, that's settled then
you'll be working together, we leave it in your hands
it's no problem, sir.
in fact, I'm honored
you're great, holding on to 336
of course, I told you to follow suit
living the good life just beware of the anti-corruption guys
don't talk nonsense
Cheung, you're really loyal
why don't you throw this crappy car away?
I haven't used it for a long time.
that's why it's just sitting here
it's an old car, but still works
sp Law is our commander for this operation
sit 25th of August 2006
armored truck robbery in Central, 3 dead 16 injured
the stolen amount was US $100 million
yesterday
kowloon Bay, yesterday, 6 officers injured
two officers are still in intensive care
today, Sham Shui Po, an arms smuggler was killed 8 more officers were injured
officer Wai King Tat is a suspect
that's why we hope you can give us some information on your brother
or any other information that can help us
my brother wouldn't do such a thing
you're a police officer
you have a responsibility to aid us in our investigation
during his disappearance did Wai King Tat try to contact you in anyway?
no
did anything special happen?
do you have any information you can give us？
to find your brother?
no
you're in an awkward situation. Take time off.
if you have any news of Tat
Iet us know immediately
don't forget you are a police officer
can I ask you a question in private, sir?
leave us - Yes, sir
what do you want to know?
before he left, my brother said he had an important mission
did he go undercover?
you should know
tat is a suspect now
until the case is solved, everything is classified
sorry, sir
but if that is true, as his officer you should protect him
a commanding officer should protect his men
but he no longer works for us
whatever road he chooses, it's his problem
I know my brother too well
sorry, sir you know what he's like
no matter how white he was before
if he wanted to turn black, it would be so easy
I've said all I want to say
shit!
don't think about it. Serious Crimes will take over
they brought in a Wai King Ho for questioning
apparently his brother is connected to the robbers
Wai King Ho
Wai King Ho? Which precinct is he with?
shoot me any information
Hey, don't do anything impulsive
your info isn't much use.
just leave it to our other colleagues
Hey, cousin, do you get what I'm saying?
don't be a hero.
what's up
I'm looking for your brother Wai King Tat.
where is he?
don't just keep quiet.
you're not going till you say something
you're looking for my brother too?
don't pretend
how many, sir?
it's okay
iced tea
iced coffee
iced lemon tea
I know you're Carson Fong from Eastern
and you're Chan Chun who always gets into brawls
sir, so what have you found after following me all this time?
Wai King Ho, where is your brother?
your brother is involved in many big jobs, hand him over
I've already told the organized crime bureau everything
I'm a cop, not a criminal
your brother is a criminal
you're not so innocent yourself
I'm warning you
if I find out you're withholding information,
I'll cuff you myself
your brother has turned
if people find out about him you'd be disgraced
I'm telling you
your brother is like this glass of milk
it's already changed colors.
kid, you get it?
I believe my brother is still a good cop.
I know your girlfriend died because of these guys and you want revenge.
and you want to get your repute back.
you're both not fit to be good cops.
my business is none of yours
hey kid? Are you asking the questions or am I?
if your bullets are not clean, the toilet is over there.
Terry Dog is here. -- Boss...
hey OD... - -Terry...
get out, I don't want to serve you
get out
come with me, I'll pretend nothing has happened
Terry, you OK?
how many times have I said no?
go home, I won't spend the rest of my life with you
I'd choose someone better, you loser
your brother, Pau, is in hospital because he took his goods
you're not really that bad are you?
I'm getting blamed because Pao OD'ed?
my astrology sign matches him better than yours
I'm Gemini and you're Capricorn, we're not compatible
go home, you talk too much
OK, fine. Nothing more to say at this point
we should stop it just because it's unpleasant. Enough!
speak with you? You haven't earned the honor
quit pushing and shoving
OD please give us some face, don't make trouble
please talk outside
Help...stop it
you, let him go
police, what's going on?
show me your ID's, against the wall!
your friend?
are you OK, officer?
I thought you were from the Junior Police Call
you're charged with illegal assembly assault, and coercing the under aged
against the wall, and hand over your ID's
you're acting on pure arrogance
come out and show us then
don't fool around with the officer, look, he's going to cry
so what if they're cops?
don't think I'm afraid just because you're an officer
I'm saying you're rubbish you're a useless cop, so?
go away, cop!
Yeah, scram, officer!
I'm adding a new charge of mocking an officer
watch your step
throwing a fit
what's happening?
how's it?
your ID is here, come get it, pig cop!
attack!
get him!!
I'm also a cop
what did you say about cops just now?
you said we were rubbish
Yes, I say that only because the force rejected me
I'm just bearing a grudge
go
are you crazy? Stop it!
thank you...
thank you...
are you stupid?
follow me
hello report centre
there's a fight on Star Street, no officers responding
Hey, this ointment is priceless. Rub some on
is this your brother's room?
yes
so painful - -Wai King Ho -- Thanks
don't be a hero if you can't stand pain.
you're lucky to be alive
it is the duty of a policeman to maintain order in the society
to preserve justice, protect the lives and properties of the citizens
don't be pretentious
why did the two of you help me then?
had it not been for me you'd have been stabbed several times
we should just have let them kick each other's asses first
smarter to let our colleagues come and take out the dead
so your brother held the shooting record
useless now, I broke his record last year
and, runner-up trophies are just embarrassing.
that judo trophy is my brother's favorite, he enjoyed the contest
even a third prize was meaningful. What do you know?
what do I know?
those are the words of a loser
Hey, where is your brother?
I said I don't know.
your wound is very deep
you're crazy
not so hard
Gentler!
my back hurts a little, are the wounds serious?
you'll live
help me
be gentler...
not so hard, it hurts
granny, you're back
these are my colleagues, Chan Chun and Fong Yik Wei.
you...
fell down - -Cars crash
chasing crooks
what? Did anything come up?
the suspects tried to flee to Thailand after that job.
but they were stopped by SDU at Tai O Pier
three died, another four escaped
they only reappeared last night when they killed Tiger
and Tiger?
what's his connection to them?
tiger was brought in for questioning
they suspected him of selling arms to the gang
but they didn't have enough evidence to charge him
all the guards who're on the route died
except for the supervisor, Ho Wing Keung, but he's now insane
doctors said he suffered a nervous breakdown
he's been admitted into an asylum hasn't shown any improvement
ho Wing Keung is your cousin?
he's in special care unit, upstairs to the left of the stairs
he can't recognize anyone but you can always try
thanks
brother, drinking water is good
from the looks of you, your illness is pretty serious
but I think there's nothing wrong with your memory
who was the mastermind? Who betrayed us?
tell me
are you afraid to speak because you also played a part in it?
I recently went to see your wife
the kids are growing up fast
your son told me you were here
this place isn't bad, pleasant surroundings.
better than jail
your poor family split up like this
they're really suffering inhumanely
Hey, there's cop
run
you really should appreciating your family
they've stuck by you through your illness
we're different. We have no family.
let go!
but we are seven brothers
my brother
now there's only four of us left
the patient has suffered post-traumatic stress
he's not only lost his memory
he doesn't react to external factors
who betrayed us?
Kitty, is Ho Wing Keung in his room?
no, he's in the lounge, he has a cousin visiting
shit!
what's up? -- Mind your own business
could it be someone from OCTB?
would someone from OCTB say he is a cousin?
ho Wing Keung
ho Wing Keung
don't scare him
don't be afraid. We're from the police.
do you remember a robbery 6 months ago?
the suspects have reappeared
please let us know if you have any information on them
I don't care if you're faking it or for real
you're in grave danger now
they already killed Tiger, you're next
think about it
if you're clean, they wouldn't be looking for you
speak
there's a bomb, there's a bomb, there's a bomb...
bomb!
my car, hey, why are you in my car?
hurry...
safety belt...
watch out for the people. That asshole was pretending
mental patients are not lucid
did you think I wouldn't be able to find you?
Where's my wife and kids
relax, you'll see them in awhile
my money is in a safe place, I'll give it to you.
don't harm them
I don't want your money, I just want ours.
call him
I haven't seen him since that night.
I don't know where he is
who is he?
move
OK, I want to know my family is safe before I tell you
in front
no worries, ambulance is on its way
my leg... my leg...
hang on
hang on, sir...
get out, get out of the car
stop
ho Wing Keung
get out of the car
bastard
do you know how many lives you're responsible for?
they have my wife and kids,
I have to save them
they're just kids, you madman!
hey kid, don't look...
step over here
I promise you
I will tell you everything when I see my family
I promise you I will
he was really the one who betrayed us six months ago
but it's useless to hold him
you can see he hasn't the guts to steal your money
so what if you kill him?
is that going to make you a hero?
you speak sense, it's almost like you've known us for a long time
that's right
I haven't really answered your question
I was the one who committed the robbery six months ago, so?
six months ago, a woman was out shopping for some rings
wedding rings
she's dead now because of these robbers
you killed her, you all killed her
she was my fiancee
so this is all to avenge your girlfriend
we're quite similar in some ways
the seven of us grew up in an orphanage together
but you cops you killed three of us
you're killers and robbers, you have no right to accuse us
if I let you go now, wouldn't you kill me too?
so it's OK for cops to kill?
I vowed that you will die a horrible death
you think you can kill me?
I believe so, yes, because this is a righteous world
if you don't live past the next second
how would you know the world is righteous?
where is justice?
where was justice when I was starving?
I get justice through my own bare hands
remember, you have to have the ability
you promised your woman
I made a vow to my brothers
if there was justice in this world
I hope we keep both our promises
what's the point of all this rambling?
I dare you to let the kids go
looks like you want to eat me up,
I don't blame you for being pissed off
it's personal, you're not being professional
professional, my foot!
you're inhuman
being human is not important, surviving is
hold it
you look like my brother, but not in temperament
my brother is much kinder
he's called Wai King Tat, do you know him?
he's a cop, undercover cop, right?
where is he?
I already said he was undercover, do you think he's alive?
I killed him
your brother didn't suffer
it just took one shot
Why?
why did you have to kill him?
why did you have to kill him?
Why?
I'll put you behind bars
if you want revenge, you can come after me
I admired your brother, really
had he not been a cop we could have been friends
actually you're like your brother
you must be some kind of model cop
but let me tell you the person who betrayed your brother is also a cop
honey --Daddy. -- Kit.
Keung
daddy
I missed you
you're a good boy
what's happened to you?
it's nothing, just a misunderstanding
you said everything would be fine in 6 months
I'm fine now
let me tie up loose ends, I'll be back in a few days.
don't worry
Keung, don't leave us
there's some money in the safe deposit box, take it
you have to listen to your mum, OK?
be good - Listen to mom
come back soon
I'll be back once I've settled things.
look after him -- Come back soon -- OK
listen to your mum or I'll spank you when I come back
hurry back, Keung!
the phone number is 9238-0906
it's hard to get hold of you
you were so wrong not to get rid of all of us at Tai O Pier
rubbish we want our money back
take the money to the Tamar Carnival
I can't return empty-handed this time
take the money to the safety boxes in Tamar in one hour
don't try anything, don't make me go get you at the police station
give me the phone
damn it!
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
are you inhuman?
look at your friend, if you're not here within an hour...
kids, which of you has a hair clip?
is the money ready?
good, wait at the Ferris wheel
we'll come to the station to get you if there's even a penny missing
someone will bring a bag of cash to you at the Ferris wheel
get it for me, wait at the north entrance
you have 15 minutes
if you're late, your friend and the kids will die
remember, take off the handcuffs and people will die
get off the car
Sam sir
are you two mad? What are you doing?
do you even realize you're in deep shit?
hand over the money
what money?
we're here to catch crooks
they're holding more than 10 kids
the bombs will go off any time, we're out of time
freeze
don't come closer, I get a bomb
ask them to get away
calm down
you guys calm down, there's so many people here
bomb
get out
go
ask them to get away
go
chan Chun and Carson are holding Sam
how did this happen?
Sam got news the suspects would turn up at the Tamar
he went down with a team and next thing we knew, this happened
they're both cops
there are bad cops too
I'm SP Cheung how many hurt at the scene?
what's that? Is it a clock?
I haven't seen that
odd sounds
don't touch that, it's a bomb
what are you playing at?
you're cops
if you carry on like this, even the Chief won't be able to save your ass
Wai King Ho and the kids are in their hands
our hand was forced, sir
tien Yeng Seng is holding the kids hostage and asked you to bring the money
then what are you still investigating?
after the robbery 6 months ago
the mastermind took the money, now the gang wants the money
Really?
they killed Tiger first, then went for the truck's guard Ho Wing Keung
who's the mastermind?
don't know yet but he's a cop
the gang has just gone after him
OK I trust you. Quick, give me the gun
I'll get someone to save Wai and the kids
quickly, where is the location?
the bastards didn't come, only two cops
Carson Fong and Chan Chun
I said they didn't come
I told you not to mess with those bastards
they're going after you now
it's OK, I know what to do
Why?
no reason. One wrong step and there's no turning back
sorry
OK I believe you. Quick, give me the gun
I'll get someone to save Wai and the kids
he didn't need a gun to help us
Sam sir...
up there, after them!
what's written up there? - 28 sec.
go
Hurry...hurry...
hurry
run faster...
Where's my sister?
my little sister is missing
what can I do?
you run over there, quickly. Tell me who reaches first
what the hell, still sleeping?
get up...
Hey, I'm Wai King Ho
any news on the two of them?
they ran into trouble at the fair, no news since then
Hey, Lam Lam
where are you? How are you?
wait... How's Ho?
ho called.
he's coming back with the kids
are they all right?
remember this number
please check out the number for me
see who it belongs to, and where, OK?
that's it
it's hard to guess what will happen
Hey, your phone
Sam's dead. I know who you are
split your money 50-50
don't try anything funny... Talk later
what's the matter?
cheung sir, Law sir we found Sam's body at the fairground
what?
issue a warrant for their arrest, we have to get them no matter what
Yes, sir
lam, have you checked it out?
Yes, it's done
Yes, it's here in the station, it's SP Cheung
the call is from his office line.
that's it
it's Cheung Man Yiu
there are orders to arrest you what's happening?
where is SP Cheung?
he's still in his office
find out what other information there is.
let us know
sir, the Chief is here and he's demanding to see you
where is he?
he only said he wants you in the conference room
I'm on my way down
why did this happen?
why was Sam killed? Why?
did you take money?
did the gang pay you a lot?
I'm really perplexed
whether you believe it or not
cheung sir and Sam sir were the ones involved in the robbery case
you two have killed a Chief Inspector
don't think you can make up stories and get away with it
permission to speak, sir
say it
that day, only SP Cheung knew the route of the armored truck
no one else knew the gang would try to flee at Tai O either
or reappear at the fairground, sir
I don't have time to explain to you, sir
sp Cheung took their money and they're at the station to find him
where? At the station?
this is the station, as you know
you think this is a playground?
I'm just saying their target is Cheung Man Yiu
they will go wherever Cheung is, sir
enough, no more nonsense
you are under arrest
you have the right to a lawyer
if you have anything else to say tell it to the judge
law sir, someone to see you urgently from the intelligence unit
what? Why?
law sir, we've discovered something
cheung sir procured
Wai King Tat's file 6 months ago
after that Wai disappeared, and then...
are you telling me Cheung is in it with the robbers?
Yes, an hour ago Cheung already transferred all his money to a Canadian account
he's also booked on a flight to Canada tonight
if you don't go after him now will be too late
Hey, quiet, keep it down
now, go home and listen to your mum and dad -- OK? - -Yes!
uncle is going to go after the crooks now
be careful!
Bye!
Michelle, please send the children home
the kids are all here
you're getting big troubles - -Don't ask, just go. -- Thanks
right, wait for me out front.
don't be late
enough, stop!
I was wrong
but I didn't want to betray you
I wanted you to go and rob but you killed many cops.
what could I do?
you threatened to kill me,
I wasn't going to sit around and wait
you forced my hand, you would have done the same if it had been you
we're all in this for the money.
let's just split it
no use killing me.
you can take my share and split it
the cash is in the parking lot, I'll take you there
what?
I located Inspector Cheung, they're going to the parking lot
go
the money's here,
I didn't take any of it
give you back the money take it
don't kill me
take it, it's all there
the money's here,
take it all and let me go
cheung
why are you involved with the robbers?
why did you?
do you know how many have died?
how can you make it up to your brothers? To me?
were you so desperate for money?
if so, you could have borrowed from me. Say something
bastard, I can't be bothered
gasoline, run
go, I'm fine...
inform the others the suspects are disguised as cops, hurry!
go...
nobody move!
queue up...
stop -- Stop! -- Stop!
upstairs
sir, are you okay?
police! Freeze! - Hey...
stop running!
retreat
cheung sir...
area cordoned, sir
too dangerous, they have heavy artillery and bombs
tell them to back off
it's improper, sir
this is an order, retreat!
don't move
shoot then
shoot and avenge your brother
what are you waiting for?
your brother had a chance to kill me
but he was too soft, and I killed him in the end
shoot
shoot me here. It's where he got shot
I'm a robber, no one will blame you if you shoot me
then you would have paid tribute to your brother
quick
killing is such a thrill
is it really?
is that the only way to survive?
this world is not like that
I have no right to kill you,
I'm a cop. You're under arrest.
you're as stupid as your brother
my brother and I had a duty to catch you, not kill you -- Police, don't move -- I am...
you shot the wrong guy
idiot, why didn't you shoot?
put down all your weapons
your brother told me something once
but it's unfortunate
you and I are not alike
I exist in a dog eat dog world
if you don't kill, you will be killed
I'm a bad guy, I can't change
you won't understand
but you have changed.
the bomb didn't go off in the bus
it shows you have a conscience
Why?
why are you brave enough to kill but not to change?
give up, you can't escape
put down your gun, come out!
I promise you I'll be a good guy
in my next life
put down your gun
do you want to die before you'll give us the money?
I want you to go down and apologize to my girlfriend
you can't have revenge
you're in such pain,
I'd be doing you a favor in killing you
the money is here
brother
police
Wai King Ho
arrest him, arrest him, arrest him...
let go, he'll kill you
arrest him...
arrest him, arrest him...
Wai King Ho
Wai King Ho
I'm sorry, I tried my best
it's alright, you just lost some blood.
don't be afraid. It's fine
I'm not afraid my brother said I shouldn't fear if I was doing right
we know, you and your brother are good cops
wai, you're great
but don't be so anal
take things easy my friend
sorry, I haven't asked to see your photos
be worth her love for you
we are police officers
we've been friends for 20 years. I didn't want it like this.
if you don't die, I can't be get away with this
I wouldn't do this if I had a choice
put down your gun...
sir, are you all right?
let them go! Let them go!
shut up, shut up and listen to me
let the two of them go
let the two of them go, they're also police officers.
don't you hear me?
call the Chief of Police
I thought you were dead
it's OK, don't cry
shush
I'm sorry
what are you doing tomorrow?
looking for work. -- Find some for me.
see you
are you not showing me respect?
do you know who I am?
I play mahjong with your
csp Wong every night $320, that's nothing to me.
how about I give you $640?
bet you're not this efficient catching crooks
look at you, you're a mess
mister, if you continue like this
I can take you back to the station and charge you with abuse
dad, no...
we're waiting for you
Yes, sir
the field is out of the gate...
...headed straightaway for this feature race.
the track fast, weather clear, six furlongs out of the chute.
the flag is up. We may get a start any moment.
battling Fur at a little fraction. And there they go.
channel Boy breaks on top, Picassio's away at second...
...Harper's Ferry third.
that's all you gotta do, girlie?
what? -Feeding pigeons, for crying out loud.
Why? -Why not?
what? -What a park.
would you care for a peanut? -Would I what for?
peanut? Care for?
I bothering you? -No.
okay. So why you wanna bother me?
who's?
what a park.
you said it. A person can't even open their mouth in it.
Hey, how about you shut up? We're trying to play a serious game here.
look, girlie, I don't mind a pickup once in a while...
...only I like to do the picking, see?
how'd you like to watch some of your language?
who are you? -Nobody, that's who.
so, what are you trying to make a big stink?
who, me? -Sure, you. Not who.
comes in, walking in barefooty, sits down on the top of me...
top of? -...starts throwing around peanuts...
...gets all them dusty birds over.
top it off, she tries to pick me up, as if I ain't got enough troubles now.
listen, how'd you like a good smack in your face?
why don't you try it. -Because it's too hot's why.
what a park.
how'd you like that? -Not bad. A real interesting shot.
is there a water fountain around here?
Yeah. Come on, I'll show you.
my whole throat's dry from getting so mad.
no, no. Probably from the peanuts, no doubt.
have one? -Thanks.
What'd you say about a shot?
movie shot, grabbed it while you were screeching.
what's the idea? -It's my business. Documentaries.
what's that? -Well, I make movies.
only they're about real things. People, places, things.
this one I'm working on now is about Central Park.
well, I'm glad you think I'm a real thing.
Decidedly.
have a drink. On me.
what are you doing, following me around?
let's go, sunshine.
what a park!
you think he'll be all right? -I doubt it.
okay, son? -I'm thirsty.
come on, Michael.
ma, can I have a dime? -No, Michael.
I'm losing my patience with you.
I wanna get a bottle of soda. I'm thirsty.
no, Michael. You've had enough to drink.
no. I'm losing my patience with you.
wait till your father hears about this day.
are you a New Yorker?
only since about less than two years. Are you?
ten years, still not used to it. I'm from Westfield, New Jersey.
the one thing I can't understand about New York...
...is why everybody here's so unfriendly.
I've wondered too. Where are you from?
Binghamton. Upstate New York.
Pete Sheppard. How do you do? -Thank you.
well, do you have a name? -Of course.
well?
yeah? -Gladys Glover.
glad to know you, Gladys. -Thank you.
Gladys Glover, huh? -It's not much of a name.
why do you say that? -Because nobody ever heard of it.
and I guess nobody ever will.
you mind that? -Of course.
you're on the young side what that seems so important.
after a while, you won't care so much. -Sure, because then it'll be too late.
what's your line?
well, since this morning about 1 1: 30, nothing.
I got canned on account of three-quarters of an inch.
around the hips. -Well, think of that.
I had this good job modeling girdles.
you know what they are? -Well, sure.
this designer and the boss got into a whole hassle...
...on account of a couple of wrinkles. Back and forth. Back and forth.
I was in the middle.
so the designer says the girdle's the right size, I'm the wrong size.
so the boss says, "I'll bet you $50."
so Mr. Ostrander took the bet.
he's a designer.
they got out a tape measure.
just my luck. This morning, three-quarters of an inch too much.
so it would've been all right, except on account of losing the $50.
the boss tells me to go get my time.
I wouldn't get discouraged.
sometimes you lose a job just to get a better one.
I don't know.
I just wanna think it over. I mean, the whole thing over.
that's why I came here to the park.
I always think I can think better in the park.
that's why I took my shoes off.
I always think better with my shoes off. You ever notice that?
on or off, I have trouble.
but what I have to think about...
...is if I should stay in New York in the first place, or else go back home.
I mean, you take New York.
you never meet anybody to talk to...
...unless it's somebody you happen to know...
...or somebody fresh or looking for something they're not entitled to.
it's an extremely unfriendly community.
if you only knew how long it took me to save up the $1 000.
what $1 000? -That I saved up.
the reason I came to New York was to try and make a name for myself.
and I haven't even gotten started on it.
I'm getting nowhere. You know what I mean?
some people, when they get to that point...
...where they realize that they're getting nowhere...
...they just kill themselves.
but I don't feel like it.
well, that is a fairly drastic step.
the only other thing is to go back home.
do the same thing as everybody else.
go back to work in the shoe factory.
marry the first man that asks.
or the second.
and then...
...goodbye "name for yourself."
goodbye dreams.
in fact, goodbye, Charlie.
if you'll forgive me, Gladys...
...I'd better get back to being gainfully employed.
thanks for the peanuts. -You're more than welcome.
say, if you'd care to give me your address...
...I could drop you a postcard and show you this picture when it's done.
I'd give my right arm to see myself in the movies.
just give me your right address.
262 West 61 st. -Yeah? Fine.
room 9.
well, so long, Gladys.
I saw that in a French movie last week. I've been meaning to try it ever since.
good luck to you, Gladys. I sure hope you make a name for yourself.
lf that's what you want, you'll get it. -How?
it's just a theory of mine that not only where there's a will, there's a way...
...but where there's a way, there's a will. See?
so long. -Thanks.
yes? -What?
someone?
I want to see Mr. Pfeiffer, please.
who? -Mr. Horace Pfeiffer.
lsn't this his place? -This is the Horace Pfeiffer Company.
but there is no Mr. Pfeiffer.
excuse me. -Just what was this in reference to?
to...
about the sign on Columbus Circle.
yes?
it says it's for rent.
yes?
well, so who do I see in reference to it if there's no Mr. Pfeiffer like you say?
well, one moment.
well, that's Mr. Entrikin.
walk down the hall and turn left, on the floor below.
no, no. I don't want the average space.
give me the exact footage on each location.
come.
what was that? All right, go ahead.
good morning. Have a chair.
thank you.
go ahead.
you.
it's about the sign space you have for rent over there in Columbus Circle.
how many? All right.
Oh, yes, the double bulletin board.
I don't know what you call it. It's pretty big, all right.
right. I'll take it up with C. D.
Yes, that's available.
how much do you charge to rent it?
well, now, just whom do you represent?
Oh, just myself.
I see.
but what's your idea?
of what?
of making this inquiry. -Oh, I'm not making any inquiry.
I just wanna rent that sign.
that is, if it isn't too expensive.
I see.
well, it's something personal, if that's what you mean.
I'm sorry, but I'm too busy for this sort of thing.
what sort of thing? What's the matter?
well, here's to pay for it with and everything.
yes?
see if you can get an option.
of course, if you're too stuck-up...
...or you think it's right to treat somebody like some kind of a nut.
call you back.
I just happened to be walking along and the sign said for rent...
...and it said your name and your address, so I want it.
so you say you haven't got the time. What kind of a place is this anyway?
the space rate on that location is $21 0 per month.
three months minimum.
yes? -Never mind 1 1: 40. 1 1: 30's all right.
I'll take it. -What?
what's the matter?
nothing. Nothing.
wait a second. Wait a minute.
Hey. Hey, painters.
wait a minute. Hey.
Hey, sign painters, listen. Hey, listen.
what's that? -G. G.
What'd she say? -"Oh, gee."
not C, like you got it. G, like you haven't got it.
what?
not C, like you got it. G, like you haven't got it.
look at the paper.
what?
look at the paper.
sure enough.
Thanks, lady. -Thank you.
faster.
please, faster.
I don't want excuses. I just want that space.
but, Mr. Adams, you said you'd call me by Monday.
what about it? -Well, you didn't.
well, what about it? -Well, then I phoned you.
well?
and they said that you were still away on your weekend.
Oh, they did? -So I tried again on Tuesday
all right, all right.
then I just assumed you'd lost interest.
you know that the Adams Soap Company...
...has always used that space for every summer campaign.
you know how my father feels about that space.
he's very partial to it. -I know
why don't we all watch our blood pressure, Mr. Adams.
I'm sure it can be arranged. -Nothing to it.
don't smooth me, gentlemen.
right now he tells us it's tied up for three months.
excuse me. -Yes, but I'm quite sure that as soon
send her right in, please.
she's here. Troubles are over.
sit down, Miss Glover.
sit down.
go ahead.
now, Miss Glover, thank you very much for coming up.
I told you on the phone that you wouldn't regret it, and you won't.
these gentlemen are terribly keen to use that Columbus Circle space...
...which you have tied up right now.
now, they're fully aware that in asking you to give it up...
...they're probably interfering with some plans which you have.
after all, nobody hires display space just to put their name on it.
what they're prepared to do is this.
and in my opinion, it's a very handsome offer indeed.
reimburse you to the full extent of what you've spent so far...
...and in addition, make you a bonus of
I think the figure mentioned was $500.
I don't think so.
Oh, this is Mr. Evan Adams lll. Miss Gladys Glover.
how do you do? -How do you do, Mr. Adams lll?
why not? -Why not what?
would you care to make a counterproposal, Miss Glover?
what's that?
well, if you won't accept 500, what would you accept?
Oh, nothing.
come now. Surely you have some figure in mind.
no, I haven't.
you would take 5 million, wouldn't you?
Oh, certainly.
now, somewhere between 500 and 5 million...
...there must be an acceptable figure.
I don't wanna do this. In 73 days more, the whole thing will be over...
...and then you can have it back and do whatever you want.
I don't like being hollered at.
What'd I do anyway?
excuse me.
hello. -Hello.
Hello! -Hello.
well, what are you doing around here anyway?
I live here.
where? -Room 7.
since when? -Today.
gee, that's great.
I wasn't figuring on this much of a welcome.
you're welcome.
what's happened to you? Last time, you were ready for the river.
that's over now. I'm fine.
I haven't changed. I'm the same as I was before.
only in a different way. -I see.
well, I have to go up now. -Yeah, so do l.
say, you happen to be over around Columbus Circle lately this week?
no.
why don't you go up there sometime.
what for? -Oh, look around.
at what? -Different things.
such as what?
different signs.
signs? -Sure.
don't you ever look at signs? -I suppose.
take my word. If you go up there around Columbus Circle...
...you'll see something.
Gladys.
is it possible you've been out in the sun too much today?
well, not me personally, no. -What?
is that your room, seven?
you like to see it? My room? -All right.
not really settled down yet.
what kind of view is it from here? -Oh, enchanting.
what's a good place to eat around here?
room 9. -I meant for me.
glad to have you anytime.
I couldn't do that, unless you let me take you out
sure. Why not?
well, what about tonight? -Okay.
fine. -You wanna see my room?
sure thing.
my view wasn't so beautiful last week...
...but this week it's sensational.
notice anything?
no. What?
what's the matter with your eyesight?
nothing.
you got any ideas for after dinner?
I thought it would be nice to go over to Columbus Circle...
...and sit around.
well, sure, if you want to.
but that doesn't sound like entertainment to me.
wait and see. -Gladys?
l-- -Yes?
Oh, excuse me.
did you get your message? -No.
I left it by the phone. You have to call Mr. Adams.
the third? -No, he only called twice.
excuse me.
I guess you two are pretty old friends, huh?
Oh, yes, indeed.
I hear you have a movie machine in there.
Oh, that's right.
I'll show you some fascinating documentaries.
don't do me no favors. Pay your rent 5: 00 Fridays...
...no radio after 1 1, and we'll get along fine.
check.
well, sure, but I mean, what's the point, Mr. Adams?
well, I know, but it's not a question of any deal.
well, sure, I'm open-minded.
no. Why should I have anything against you?
what kind of a break?
okay, 7: 30.
goodbye.
yes?
Oh, look, about tonight, I'm sorry, but I can't.
it's sort of business, you know what I mean.
well, sure, if it's business.
well, maybe tomorrow night.
no. I have to go to Westfield for a couple days. Family stuff.
and I won't be back till Friday morning.
all right, what about Friday lunch? -Okay.
wish you'd told me before I got my hair brushed.
I'm sorry. -Yes, I am too.
I was looking forward to a big evening sitting around Columbus Circle.
Pete, listen.
everything's beginning to go great for me, just great.
in a way, it's all on account of you.
lt is? -Something you said.
well, it made me do something I did.
and, well, that's why. -Well, that's fine.
so thank you very much. -lt was really nothing.
thank you. -What for?
for coming out this way. -What way?
I mean, I appreciate it. -So do l.
Oh, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, no, wait.
wait. Where are you going? -What is it?
aren't you gonna go around Columbus?
what for? -To see it.
lt? -What this whole date's about.
what? -What I've got that you want.
what you've got--? -The sign.
Oh, the sign. Yes. Yes, of course.
every time I see it, I get a bigger one than last time. Boot.
would you drive around once more? -A pleasure.
if you knew what it means to me...
...how it makes me feel and all...
if you knew, you wouldn't ask me for it.
not even for your own soap.
I have another idea. -Like?
well, l-- -Once more?
what? -Around once more.
but just once more. I'm getting a little hungry.
what's food?
now, what I had in mind was this...
...that we share the sign. Then we'd all be happy.
I'm happy now.
when you think that last week I was nobody...
...and this week I've got my name on that big sign...
...and dancing in a place like this where everybody's somebody.
you said something up at the office. -Yeah.
something about 73 days more? -From tomorrow, 72.
now, my idea is this.
if you split the space with us, you could be up there for six months.
I could? -I'd see to it.
in writing?
if you like.
only not in such big letters, huh?
well, no.
look! -What?
Walter Winchell. -Oh, yeah.
that makes the seventh big name I've seen tonight.
what a night.
well, good night. -Good night.
thank you very much. -Not at all.
I had a real good time.
unusual. -So did l.
well, good night. -Good night.
well, good night. -Good night.
well, this is it.
what? -Where I live.
Oh, good. -So I guess I better go in.
very well.
because it's pretty late. -Yes, it is.
and besides, I don't think your car's safe down there.
no? -You don't know this neighborhood.
locked.
they don't need keys, not around this neighborhood.
I'm scared you'll lose your car.
I have another one.
shall we?
see that? -What?
you better go.
I'll call you tomorrow. -Okay, but
but I don't think I wanna give up my sign.
yes? -Open up.
who is it, please? -Open up.
what do you think--? -I wanna talk to you.
what about? -That thing up in Columbus Circle.
I went over there, all right.
first off, I couldn't believe my eyes. Then I thought, "What a gag."
since then, I have been thinking about it, and it gets my goat.
Why?
I smoked a pack and a half of cigarettes trying to figure it out.
what out? -And you.
cost money, doesn't it?
certainly. -Where'd you get it?
it's my own. I saved it up.
and is that the best you can think of to do--?
what sort of a fruitcake are you anyway?
no sort of.
so kindly get out of my room, please. -With pleasure.
it's none of your business.
lt is if there's a maniac on the loose. -I'm no maniac
just once, every so often, something really gets my goat.
and this is one!
to think I actually know a grown-up, civilized woman...
...who can take her hard-earned cash, just take it and throw it away...
...on a nonsense, as though it were garbage!
you hear me ask you what you do with your money?
don't bother, I haven't even got any. -All I did
all I did is happen to meet you in the park, by accident.
so I don't see where that gives you the right to tell me off.
correct.
and furthermore, different people do different things...
...that may seem crazy to other different people...
...but that doesn't make it.
correct.
and furthermore, do me a favor and butt out!
would you do me a favor? -Like what?
remember my name? -Sure, Pete Sheppard.
well, do me a favor and forget it!
ls it still on for Friday lunch? -Certainly!
thank you very much! -Don't mention it!
so the point that we're trying to make is just this...
...that there's no reason for you to be unreasonable.
I don't think I'm unreasonable.
you don't? -No.
I think I'm reasonable. You're the ones that are "un."
wait a minute. Here's something. -Where?
would this be a solution?
supposing we gave you two signs in trade for this one?
two?
possibly three?
how big?
I don't know offhand. We'd have to look into it.
but not as big as this one, huh? -Possibly not, no.
no soap. -What?
after all, Gladys-- Miss Glover, the size of the sign doesn't matter.
no? -No.
no, it's the location.
now, what if we found you four fine locations...
...and fitted them up for you?
how about six?
very well, six. -And where?
let me have the chart, will you, please?
well... -Most desirable.
and one in the 42nd Street subway station.
well... -Then there's one on the West Side.
yeah? -And one on the East Side.
yeah? -And one in Grand Central Station.
so now I'm all over the place.
this may be the best lamb chop I ever had.
one of them's an electric sign. Did I say that?
you sure know what to do with them.
I bet if I held out for eight signs instead of six, I would've got eight.
fish is what I like.
did you ever go down to the Fulton Fish Market?
no. -I'd like to take you down there.
how about tomorrow night? -Fine.
and on the way down, you can look at some of my signs.
the Central Park picture's practically finished.
Really? -I just need to get some music.
I'm dying to see it. -Next week.
you know what would be nice? -What?
if you took pictures of some of my signs and put it in.
you certainly are one fine cook, Gladys.
I bet I'm the only cook that's got her name up...
...on six signs all over New York.
what's the point of it? Where's it getting you? No place.
no place?
I started out with no signs, so then I got one sign...
...so then I got six.
so where do you get "no place"?
I don't know what it is, honey, but I cannot get through to you.
let me put it this way.
what most people, real people, want is privacy.
that's about the best thing anybody can have.
not me.
what is this craze to get well-known? -Why craze?
do you think everybody is so anxious to be above the crowd?
Yes. -But what's the point of it?
in the first place, everybody can't be above the crowd, can they?
no. But everybody can try if they want to.
but why isn't it more important to learn how to be a part of the crowd?
not me.
it isn't just making a name. Don't you understand that?
it's making a name stand for something.
names stand for different things. -So who said not?
want my opinion? -No.
my opinion is this. It's better if your name stands for something...
...on one block than if it stands for nothing all over the entire world.
I don't follow your point.
I wish you could. This thing is getting more in our way every day.
what do you mean "in our way"?
I mean that...
there's a lot of things, sensible things...
...we could talk about and do and try for...
...but I can't seem to get you down to Earth.
what's so wonderful about Earth?
well, when this whole thing is over...
...when the bubble bursts, I'll show you.
Pete?
do you like me?
I sure do, except for one thing.
well, if you do, don't you be the one to burst the bubble.
okay.
and another thing.
could I ask you one question? -Sure, Gladys.
would you come out and look at one sign?
best coffee I ever had in my whole mouth.
I think that one's my favorite.
Why? -I don't know.
it's so...
so clear.
let's go. -Wait. I wanna buy a few things.
some towels.
well, buy me one too, for my head.
could I help you, madam? -Yes, please. I want six of these.
you'll take them with you? -No, COD.
name? -Gladys Glover, G-L-O-V-E-R.
address? -262 West
what? -262
did you say Gladys Glover? -That's right.
are you her? Yourself? -That's right.
well, for heaven's sake. -Why?
well, we were wondering all last week about that.
miss Glover, would you mind? -What?
would you mind signing this for my little niece?
she collects them. She'll get the biggest kick.
Harold! Guess who this is. -Yes?
I give up. -It's Gladys Glover.
no kidding. -Why should l?
who? -Don't know, dear.
Gladys Glover. -Oh? Who's she?
see? -My, my.
she gave me her autograph, Harold.
would you mind? -Of course not.
me too.
would you sign here? -Will you sign this?
who is it? -I don't know.
please, Gladys, let me have your autograph.
you got a pencil I can borrow for a minute?
I must get her autograph.
Hey, quit shoving. I was here before you!
me next, Gladys.
do you mind, Miss Glover, signing my book?
who is it? -Nobody, believe me.
St. Louis 1 1, Philadelphia 8. Now for the National League.
there were only three games today.
Philadelphia at Milwaukee was rained out.
the Giants defeated Chicago 5 to 3.
Cincinnati beat St. Louis 1 0 to 9. Brooklyn...
three days more...
...and I'm nobody again.
Yeah, but I'll show you how to enjoy that.
if I only had the money.
it isn't a question of money, believe me.
I could have been on the covers of matchboxes, pencils...
...anything you can think of.
we're gonna have a long talk in a few days, Gladys.
in fact, several other talks.
ln fact, we may end up talking-- -What about?
what do you think? -Why not now?
because this is important.
and I've got to wait till I'm sure...
...that your ears and eyes and your everything...
...are just a little more ready to-- Well...
Gladys Glover. -Yeah?
Gladys Glover.
Gladys Glover.
Gladys Glover.
mean anything to you?
he's talking about me.
well, it's the subject for your Manhattan Nightcap for tonight.
new Yorkers are speculating as to the answer...
... to one of the most unimportant questions of the day.
namely, who or what is Gladys Glover?
did you hear that?
signs bearing this mysterious name are appearing all over our town.
but it's this department's guess that Gladys Glover...
...is a second cousin to the famous Kilroy.
that's 30 for tonight, friends. See you tomorrow.
good show tonight, Brod. -Naturally, thanks.
telephone, Brod.
yeah? Speaking.
who? Oh, can it. Who is this?
what?
it is?
Gladys Glover in person.
well, insulting in what way?
well, now, you can't blame folks for wondering, now, can you?
say, where are you anyway, and how long you gonna be there?
no, I just wanted to get the rest of the story.
Yeah, fine.
I'll be right down.
Gladys Glover?
the mystery woman!
correction. For "mystery woman" reads "screwball."
I'll let you know.
keep going, sweetie. -Well, that's about all.
except I was telling Pete...
...if I had money, I could've made myself...
...into one of the most well-known people around.
let me ask you something, Glover.
what if I could plant you around a few spots? You know, radio, TV.
would you do it? -Do what?
go on. -Yeah, but do what once I'm on?
look, Gladys-- -I don't know.
maybe just tell your story. It's funny.
funny? -Well, fascinating.
I might get scared? -No, you wouldn't get scared.
I think so. I better not. -Yeah, that's right.
might be some cash in it.
there would?
might. Of course, I'd expect my cut.
Oh, sure. Why not?
you're not hooked up in any way?
how do you mean?
well, like engaged or engaged to be engaged.
look, mister-- -Wait a second. Why?
I was just thinking, there's this TV turn.
they call it Man and Wife. You get married on the program.
I understand it's quite a haul. -Really?
what are you looking at? -I don't know.
Gladys, please don't get mixed up in anything more.
you wanna turn into a freak? How do you--?
there's The People Speak. They're looking for goofballs.
you hear? You're a goofball. -Now, that's just a figure of speech.
I happen to know this fella who runs the program.
let me sound him, see what happens, okay?
go ahead, sound.
ladies and gentlemen, you have just heard the story...
...of three very great and very brave men.
and so another miracle is entered into the annals of exploration.
gentlemen, thank you for an inspiring story.
now? -When he gives you a wave.
and here she is, the gal who believes in signs.
come on.
everyone wants to be famous, don't you?
everyone would like to see their name in lights, wouldn't you?
but as Mark Twain once said about the weather:
everybody talks about it, but nobody does anything about it.
well, Gladys Glover is one girl who decided to do something about it.
but let's get her own story in her own words.
well, Gladys, how did you get this idea?
lt just came to me.
I was walking along, and I happened to feel on the blue side.
and I just lost my job, and I realized that I certainly was a failure.
and I realized how the whole reason I came to New York in the first place...
...was to see if I could not make a name for myself.
and time was going by, and I was not getting any younger.
and it looked like I never would. And so then I saw this big
and then what happened?
and so then I saw this big sign up there on Columbus Circle.
and all of a sudden, I seemed to see my name on it.
that's happened to many of us, I'm sure.
Oh, yes.
and so then l...
...began to wonder how much it would cost.
so I went down and asked the man, and this is how it started.
I was in a store and somebody who saw my sign asked for my autograph.
that was some thrill, and this is too.
you mean, being with us on The People Speak?
that's right. Some thrill.
thank you, Gladys Glover.
and another thrill is I'm gonna get paid for it too.
indeed you are. Indeed you are.
do you mind telling us what you're gonna do with the money?
I'm gonna rent a lot more signs and put my name on them.
thank you very much.
she's all yours, man. -You were great, honey.
just do that all the time. Just say whatever comes into your head.
okay, whatever.
so the real value of discussion, say, on a program like this...
...or this sort, for example, is the point of view...
all she's got is nerve, far as I can see.
maybe that's all you need nowadays. Four programs in one week.
she's making a name for herself.
well, to get back to our topic:
at what age should a girl marry?
it seems to me, Dr. Manning, that it's very dangerous to generalize.
we have found now after many, many years
I quite agree with Ilka.
I know lots of girls who've been married at 1 6, and very happily too.
well, statistics show us that an early marriage
Connie, for a certain type, maturity is terribly important.
if you consider-- -Gladys, what do you think?
well...
I think, if they're big enough, they're old enough.
but, now, seriously, Dr. Manning.
don't you feel that the laws governing this whole matter...
...are very outmoded? -If you mean
of course, Ilka.
most of them were written too long ago.
and by men.
then, of course, there is the whole question of the parents' consent.
to do what?
may I just read--? -I'm terribly sorry. Our time is up.
good night, and thank you so much, Dr. Manning.
this is Ilka Chase saying good night.
give me a double. -A double what?
a double anything. What do I care?
anybody suggested to me that this Gladys Glover thing...
...was gonna mushroom like this, I wouldn't have believed it.
that's just the point.
we're more or less responsible for starting the whole promotion.
so why don't we get the benefit of it? -What's the angle?
the average American girl.
there's a lot of penetration there.
something the customer can identify with.
right. It's a whole new approach to the endorsement angle.
who endorses products now?
movie stars, opera singers, debutantes, six-day bicycle riders.
the whole thing's been done to death.
how's this?
stars use it. Celebrities too.
but more important...
...It's the favorite of average American girls such as Miss Gladys Glover.
I don't think she's so average. -Why not?
because she's unusual. -That's what you don't seem to realize.
what?
the average American girl is unusual.
how's that again? -Exactly.
he's got something there, B. P. -Wait a minute. Wait.
I see a big campaign...
...with photographs by, say, Con Cooley.
that's enough.
that's it.
not too languorous. Now, give us a smile.
keep it "Glover." That's it. Good, good. Hold it.
now, let's have the pose.
now, let's have the smile.
that's good. That's fine. Plenty of movement now.
that's it. Winter sports! Smile again.
enjoy yourself. Relax.
all right! Now, don't get excited. Take it easy.
is she all right? Is she all right?
okay, babe? You're all right. Don't be nervous.
everything is fine. You can't fall.
that's a girl. All right, let's go, fellas. Come on.
you all right, Con? -Smile.
smile, now. That's a girl. Plenty of movement. Come on. Enjoy yourself.
smile. Now, let's make this a good one.
fine, fine. Come on, smile.
come on, Gladys! Look lovable!
I'm pooped.
you know how much you earned today?
what's the difference? I'm too tired to count it.
what you need is a nice, long, cool drink.
or a nice, long, cool sleep would be better still.
how would it be if we stopped up at my place?
I don't know. How would it be? -Excellent.
I get a wonderful breeze up there from the river. We could relax...
...talk things over. -What things?
Oh, different things.
different things from what?
as a matter of fact, there's something...
there's something important.
I ought to take it up with you tonight. It can't wait.
lt can't? -No.
it's about a big cross-country personal appearance tour that I had in mind.
for me? -That's right.
Oh, I can't tonight. I've got a date, sort of.
Oh, to do what?
to drive out to Westfield, New Jersey, and meet these certain people.
that's a big drive after a long day's work.
Yeah, but I promised this person to meet these people.
what about our conference?
you see, I'd have to go to the board first thing in the morning.
if I don't, it'll be another two weeks.
then it'll be too late.
too late for the cross-country appearance?
well, for the arrangements.
well...
...maybe I could ask. -That's the way.
imported.
that's right. -Great little car.
I like it. -I like it too.
something?
what's a car like this worth?
Oh, about 5000.
Why? Do you want to buy it? -Yes, I do.
only, I don't have 5000 on me just now, and I don't get paid until Friday.
that's too bad.
you wouldn't take $1 1 and about 30 cents? I do have that on me.
no. -I didn't think you would.
Hey, that's a nice shirt you got on. -What?
I don't wanna buy it. I just noticed it. -Thank you.
I'm a great friend of Gladys.
Oh, is that so? -Yes, it is so.
she's a fine girl, Gladys. -I'm not so sure.
no? -I'm still thinking it over.
there's quite a lot to her on the one hand, but on the other hand, no.
what did you say your name was? -I didn't say.
Sheppard. -Adams.
I know. You're the fellow she's working for.
well, I wouldn't put it that way. -Well, what way would you put it?
just trying to help her get what she seems to want.
how's is she making out? -Beautifully.
how are you making out?
I can't complain. -I can.
what? -You wanna hear me?
no, thank you.
well, goodbye and bad luck, Mr. Adams. I enjoyed our little chat.
thank you.
Yes, who is it? -Me.
I knocked at your door. I wanna see you.
well, you've already seen me. -What?
you saw me, but didn't notice. I was on the stoop. You went right by.
Oh, I'm sorry. -There's this fellow waiting downstairs.
I know. Could you do this? It's stuck again.
should I tell him to go? -Well, he's waiting for me.
he is? -That's one of the things...
...I wanted to tell you. We have to do the Westfield thing another time.
it's sort of business.
look, Gladys, any other kind of date, you wanna break it, okay.
but this has been set up for a week.
and when I go to the trouble of calling my mother, and she fixes us dinner...
...and my father probably even shaved.
maybe tomorrow night? -Dinner will be cold by then.
I feel just terrible. -You should!
I have to tonight, for the board of directors.
what? -A cross-country personal appearance.
I don't know what you're talking about, and neither do you!
please don't be nasty. I'm so tired.
you're not too tired to see junior down there.
listen, Pete, I'm over 21. -From the neck down, yeah.
all right!
can't you try and understand?
that's the whole trouble. I do. I wish I didn't.
but it's business! -What kind of business?
that's some fine question, I must say! -Then how about some fine answer?
go ahead, Gladys. Go ahead. These stairs are killing you.
there you are. -Yes.
you feeling better? -Much.
there's nothing like champagne.
Yes, there is. -What?
more champagne.
it's a very interesting thing I found out.
all these different things-- I mean, the expensive ones, like champagne...
...and thick steaks and silk stuff.
what I mean to say is, it's very easy to get into the habit.
but then you take, like, different things.
like, once when I was at a boarding house...
...they gave bean sandwiches for lunch. That's a habit I never got into.
hello.
what's this? -What's what?
this. -Nothing.
I thought it was something.
no.
that's not nothing.
you're very sweet.
so, what about this...
...cross-country...? -This what?
the personal appear
I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry! -Fine place for vintage champagne.
Oh, I'm sorry!
was that an accident, or did you do it on purpose?
I'll tell you the truth. I don't know.
you don't know?
everything is so sudden.
incident
incidentally, that chap I met outside your house earlier tonight.
what chap?
sheppard?
Oh, Pete.
he said his name was Sheppard. -That's right. Pete Sheppard.
what about him?
Oh, he works on movies.
documentaries.
very interesting.
is it anything?
is what?
you and he. -Oh, no.
Oh, no!
he's just sort of a neighbor.
in fact, he doesn't even like me.
in fact, more like hate.
Why?
well...
...not exactly hate.
we just think each other are wacky.
I suppose it's because we probably...
...don't understand each other. -But you and l...
...we understand each other.
don't we?
we do? -Of course we do.
that's nice.
that was all right.
thank you.
thank you.
you must be pretty experienced, huh?
in what way?
well, I mean...
...I guess you do quite a lot of this, don't you?
I suppose I do my share.
you just live here alone?
by yourself? -Yeah.
I suppose that's why.
Why?
you must be on the lonesome side.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
you ever think of getting a parrot?
a what?
that would be nice company.
somebody to talk to.
I mean, something.
and, of course, there's lots of parrots can talk.
so then you could be talking to it, and it could be talking to you, and...
I mean, you probably wouldn't be talking to each other, but it'd be talk.
I'd rather have you. -Than a parrot?
Yeah.
I think I better be going. -Why?
because I'm not enjoying myself. -Oh, give me time.
I don't mind the way you're acting, exactly.
what I mind is the way you give the idea you're sort of entitled.
maybe I am. -Oh, well, sure.
if you wanna make it into a sort of business proposition.
well, that's what you're doing, isn't it?
if you want true romance, missy, the magazines are full of it.
the way it looks to me, Mr. Adams, there are two kinds of people:
the ones who do anything to make a name for themselves.
and ones who'll do almost anything. -And which are you?
I'll let you know. -Now, wait a second.
no. You didn't really wanna have a conference.
least not the kind I thought.
you just said that. -But after all
in the second place, this is the most important thing...
...soon there will be ads and signs saying I'm the average American girl.
your idea, wasn't it? -Well?
well, I don't think the average American girl should do this.
so good night.
remember this day, Gladys?
that was the first time I saw you.
you hadn't met me yet, but you were about to.
and when I made that close-up, I had no idea...
...you were gonna turn out to be someone special.
but a few minutes later, at the time I shot this...
...I had decided I was gonna make a try with you.
this was right after I left you. I followed you.
and a few days later, I moved in, right into here...
...right across the hall from you, and lived here.
I wonder if you realize how tough it's been living across the hall from you.
and I suppose it's all right now to tell you...
... that I sure never did get much sleep.
it was quite an uncomfortable thing...
... to lie there in the dark, night after night...
...knowing that you were only a few steps away.
well, at first it wasn't so bad, because I had hopes...
... that the trouble I was having was only temporary.
I was confident that things would develop with us.
but as time has gone by, I've realized more and more...
... that this thing is just never gonna work out.
now, maybe I didn't handle it as well as I should have.
maybe all of those times that I got sore at you, you thought I really was.
but I wasn't, Gladys.
no?
what I was sore at was that crackbrained idea of yours...
... that seemed to be taking up all of your time, your energy and interest...
...and attention, so you had no time to concentrate on anything else!
least of all me.
that's what I was sore about.
and the other day, when you drove up in that last straw...
...I knew my goose was cooked. Here I had gone along...
...figuring all the time that I was competing with your passion for fame.
and suddenly, in one fell swoop, I realized I'd been wrong all along.
now, it is just hopeless for me to try and compete...
... with a man who drives a foreign car and wears a silk suit...
...and, no doubt, real gold cuff links.
also, I had a good look at this Joe...
...and, well, I'm only being honest with myself when I say that...
...in my opinion, he's even better-looking than I am.
although I personally have reached a point where I sort of like my looks.
but then, of course, I've been around with them for quite a long while.
well...
...be that as it may...
...I never got around to bringing up the subject of "I love you.
but no doubt you're aware of it.
I'm sorry to bother you with all of this, but...
...I couldn't face handling it in person, and I can't write.
so this is probably the best way.
the reason I did not wanna just disappear...
...is because I wouldn't want you to ever think badly of me.
in fact, I hope that you can remember me...
... with some amount of affection...
...because that is the way I intend to remember you...
...for the rest of my life.
goodbye, Gladys.
what's doing?
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no!
what do you say? Time's a-wasting. -I hate this idea.
we'll talk later. Put it in your mouth.
no, I'm telling you-- -Just do it, will you, Gladys?
all right, let's have the pose.
just let your arms hang down. That's right.
and look miserable.
I can do that without even trying, mister.
and don't talk.
that's it. Let's get the next one. Snap it up now.
why did I let you rope me into this? -Rope?
this is one of the best touches we've hit.
I feel foolish, and I don't like to feel foolish.
why, sugar?
because. -Don't you realize that every place...
...that uses this display, we get $20? They're talking about 1 000 displays.
don't you understand what that means? 20, 000.
there's one thing you forget. -What?
it's a fake. -Oh, come on.
not only that, it's dishonest. -Well, don't worry about it.
and it's not dignified. -Well, isn't tomorrow dignified?
what tomorrow? -The Air Force.
I got them to name a plane after you and your picture taken...
...with generals and colonels and everything. Isn't that dignified?
well, yes, but this isn't.
well, will you let me run it, baby?
I've done a lot of things in my life, some stupid, but never crooked.
okay.
and certain people I know, they're gonna know it's a fake.
what do you care? -I don't mean everybody.
but a few people. One.
I care what they think. Him. He.
I don't even know where he is, but wherever he is
will you close your mouth?
I wrote a speech for you for tomorrow. You have to memorize it.
and wear something simple and dignified.
because tomorrow is dignified.
Yeah, but today isn't.
what do you say? -All set.
okay, clear it. Here we go, Gladys.
let's have the pose.
let's see a smile now.
Oh, no! A real smile!
think of the money.
think of not doing this anymore.
good! Hold it!
to think that of all the girls in America...
...you have
no. You men of the...military air transport service...have chosen me "the girl we would most like to...be up in the air with.
and all I can say, from the bottom of my...from the bottom of my... -Heart.
from the bottom of my heart. Let me read it from the paper.
gen. Dunkley, Col. Wiley and all you fine men.
this has been the greatest day of my life.
to think that of all the girls in America...
...you men of the military air transport service...
...have chosen me "the girl we would most like to be up in the air with.
hold it! Hold it! -Move in closer, fellas.
put your arms on them. Everyone look at her.
quiet, will you, please? We're trying to tape this. Start again, Gladys!
gen. Dunkley, Col. Wiley and all you fine men
kiss her, somebody! Kiss her! One on each side.
look like you enjoy it! -Quiet! Quiet! Start again, Gladys!
gen. Wunkley, Col. Diley and all you fi
fine men...
...to think that of all the girls in America, you men of the military...
...air transport service have chosen me:
the girl you would most like to be up in a plane with." And naming this...magnificent plane after me, I can only say, from the bottom of my...
heart. From the bottom of my heart, this means...
it's all right. She's just nervous. Stay there. We'll be back.
she's okay, nothing to worry.
what's the matter? -I don't know.
you sick? -No.
what are you trying to do? This wasn't easy to set up.
I don't care. -You don't care?
who are you not to care? Now, come on. Pull yourself together here.
get through with this, or I'll drop you like a hot potato.
I wish you would. I wish everybody would drop me. Just leave me alone.
where do you come off throwing temperament around here? You cluck!
what? -You heard me.
you're a nobody that I've blown up into a property.
you haven't done so much, Mr. Clinton.
you just made me a freak. -You were a freak...
...when I first met you, only I'm showing you how to cash in on it.
you've been doing all right too, right? -Sure, sweetie.
we've been doing all right, and we can continue.
and we can do better, only you have to stay in line.
No! -Why no?
because it's all over, the whole thing. The whole goofy thing.
there's no sense to it, no nothing.
what's the good of being above the crowd all the time?
what's wrong with being part of it?
what is all this? -Well, if you don't understand...
...I'm just sorry for you, that's all.
it isn't just making a name. What's that?
it's making a name stand for something...
...even on one block, instead of for nothing all over the world.
now, wait a minute-- -What most people want is privacy.
that's about the greatest thing anybody can have.
you know what's the trouble with you? You're not real.
I'm real enough to pop you one. -Try it.
all right. Now we blow off the steam.
now let's get down to the facts.
the fact is...
...there's only one thing I want.
like what? -You can't get it for me.
I don't even think I can get it myself.
but I'm gonna have to try.
what's happening? -Just a spin. Be right there.
Roger. -Yeah, yeah, roger.
now, listen, Gladys-- -Okay, I'll do it.
Thattagirl.
now, look, kid. I'll forget everything you just said...
...and you forget everything I just said. Fair enough?
look, honey, don't conk out on me. We got all this stuff going for us.
and listen, Gladys, the way the dough is rolling, I figure
and listen, Gladys, the way the dough is rolling, I figure
hold it, fellas. Ladies and gentlemen...
...on behalf of Gladys Glover, she just wants me to say that, well...
...she was a little overwhelmed, but she's all right now.
gen. Dunkley, Col. Wiley...
...and all you fine men...
...this has been the greatest day of my life.
not only because you wanna name a plane after me...
...but because today I found out I don't want you to.
and why?
I'm nobody to name a plane after.
I don't stand for anything.
but that plane does...
...and so do you fellas.
that makes you somebody, even if nobody knows your names...
...Whatever they are. Because every one of you are one of the crowd.
Hey, that's an idea.
why don't you call your plane One of the Crowd?
because that's what it is, and that's what makes it great.
gen. Dunkley, Col. Wiley...
...and all you fine men...
...hooray.
that's it. Laugh it up!
that's it. Don't go away, anybody.
so I really appreciate your help, folks.
you see, the idea is this. We're making this picture...
...on how the people who come here look to the animals. See what I mean?
now, the shot that we're trying for is you looking at the chimp, you see?
okay, here we go. Now, everybody watches me just as if I'm the chimp.
you see what I mean?
you know?
everybody's looking up at me.
that's it!
that's it! Everybody watches me. Let's go, kids.
all right. Somebody down front, throw a peanut at me, would you? That's it.
one at a time.
take it easy, will you?
that's it. Take it easy! Take it easy.
one at a time. One at a time. That's it.
everybody's watching the chimpanzee.
every...
well, wouldn't you know it? Just as we're getting it going almost.
Hey, Pete! Look, will you?
I figure we can make it to Pittsburgh before dark.
like to get just past and get a nice little room...in one of those motels and get right to bed.
then in the morning, get in an hour on the road before breakfast.
can't we have breakfast first?
I'll tell you what. I will get up first and bring you back your breakfast in bed.
how about that, Mrs. Sheppard?
fine.
I was born in the Caribbean, and even though I spent the first 30 years of my life here,
I know so little about the 7, 000 islands that make this area so extraordinary.
stretching from the coast of Florida down to South America, the Caribbean's history and its mix of people and cultures make it like no other place on earth.
the pristine private islands, the no-go areas, the stunning beauty, and the violent natural disasters:
the Caribbean has it all.
Hi, Sir Trevor.
good to see you again. - Good to see you.
there we go. My goodness, man!
in this series, my journey takes me 2, 000 miles across the entire Caribbean, to explore the contrasts of these incredible islands:
from Communist Havana...
it's not quite eight o'clock yet, but this guy's already on his first cigar for the day.
I've heard of people having one island, but never two.
...to a billionaire's private island.
when you're up close like this, it looks almost like a prehistoric ritual.
I get a rare glimpse of giant turtles laying eggs in Grenada.
I track down someone surprising in the Bahamas.
Hitler! How are you?
and his brother is Elvis. - Your brother's Elvis?
I think that almost makes up for it.
and I visit a former paradise wiped out by a massive volcanic eruption.
you read about these things, but you never think they have this effect.
I can't quite believe it.
this is the Caribbean as I have never seen it before.
this week, three Caribbean islands that typify the striking contrasts in this region:
Cuba, the largest of them all, and one of the last bastions of Communism in the world.
and, at the other end of the island chain, one of the most modern and wealthy islands, Trinidad...
blessed with oil reserves and now a sea full of natural gas.
it's the island where I was born, and I'll be there for the biggest day in its calendar.
but first, a place far removed from Communist Cuba, or even oil-rich Trinidad:
the British Virgin Islands, a little bit of Britain in the middle of the Caribbean Sea.
the Queen is still sovereign around these parts, and it's easy to see why Britain is keen to keep an influence here.
the natural beauty and its generous tax breaks make these islands a magnet for some of Britain's richest people.
the Caribbean offers the chance not just to own an island but to create a personal paradise, and I was about to meet a man who was one of the first to do just that.
richard Branson built a home here, but he also sells a bit of the Caribbean dream for those who can afford it.
Adam Simmonds welcomes the super-rich to Necker Island.
the price? A cool 30, 000 pounds a night.
that's Necker coming up on the horizon.
and just passing Mosquito Island. This is Richard's new island here, where he's going to build his house.
absolutely beautiful, the way it nestles between Mosquito and the rest of Virgin borders
it is, yeah. It's kind of unique, the way that it's out on its own.
and even from here you can see the nice beaches around Necker there.
Yes. That's another thing which does make it unique around here.
for the size of the island, it does have two very beautiful large beaches.
there's Richard, we can see right at the top there. Right at the top there.
there are at least two staff members for every guest on the island, each one charged with making Necker a true Caribbean fantasy.
how many guests do you accommodate here?
we take 28 guests and they basically book the whole island, so this is all theirs.
here we go. This is the main house here.
Richard. - How are you?
not too bad. Good to see you. - Lovely to see you.
thank you very much for allowing us in. - Come along in.
the main room. - This is wonderful!
this is more than just a holiday home for Richard.
for most of the year, this is where he and his family live.
he showed me round the house which he started building when he bought the island, over 30 years ago.
when did you first see Necker?
well, I was 26 years old.
I was in New York. I was chasing this lovely lady.
and so I rang up an estate agent, pretended I wanted to buy an island.
so it was a pretence in the first place? - A complete pretence.
and the estate agent said, "We'll lay on a house, we'll lay on a helicopter.
I thought, "This is all right." We pulled out a map, saw where the Virgin Islands were.
they looked like in a lovely part of the world, and I persuaded her to come down for the weekend, and we went looking for islands.
I didn't have the money, the wherewithal to buy it.
but I came back a year or two later, I'd made a few pennies.
and buying an island impressed the lady in question, did it?
it impressed her enough so that she's now the mother of my children, and we've been together for 32 years, so it worked well.
of course, island buying is no easy game.
necker was totally uninhabited.
everything had to be brought in and built from scratch.
but the other point about it is that you then had to provide all the energy, the water, the electricity.
Yeah. I mean, buying an island... - The entire lot.
that's the easy bit! - I bought this island for about 60, 000 pounds, so it was the equivalent of a very, very small house in England.
but there was nothing on it, so it's taken 30 years of love, and waiting for Boy George to have a hit or Phil Collins.
Phil Collins built this part of the island, and the Rolling Stones built Bali High.
as they had hit records we would carry on developing it.
richard was taking me to the crow's nest, the best place for the most spectacular views of Necker.
this, he assured me, was a view worth paying for, even on a cloudy day.
well, there is absolutely no question. This is the view.
there's nowhere more beautiful in the world.
on the day we arrived, Richard's guests were preparing to leave.
I was curious to know who would pay 30, 000 pounds a night to stay here.
then I met PJ, who was waiting for the helicopter to take her off the island.
how long have you been here? - I've been here...
we came in for about three nights.
three nights? Where do you come from for three nights?
erm... New York. - From New York? For three nights here?
that's a long way just for three nights.
Oh no, it's worth it. - Is it worth it?
when PJ comes, she doesn't waste a minute. She doesn't go to bed.
she got one hour's sleep last night.
Oh, so the parties which go on here go on all evening, do they?
Yeah, there's a party every night, which is why I have to retreat to stay sane.
at nearly 100, 000 pounds for a three-day stay, was it any wonder that PJ and her friends wasted little time sleeping during their holiday?
and they're not the only ones wanting to buy in to a ready-made Caribbean lifestyle.
so you bought it for about 60, 000.
if somebody were to offer you to buy this back, it would be more like... 60 million? probably more.
Yeah. No, I think, erm...
we've had an offer in excess of 200 million.
but it's priceless. We'd never sell it.
it's one of those things which is absolutely priceless.
you've had to make really big decisions in your life about business and so on.
has this been the sort of place where you come and it enables you to quietly think about strategies and what you're going to do next?
have you found it useful in that way?
Yes. I mean, my office is the hammock over there.
I've always worked from home.
erm... And that's meant I've had time to think about the bigger picture and not get bogged down by the minutiae of everything.
Yeah, this is my number one office. - So this is the office?
Yes, I can see a lot of hard work being done here.
well, there's a lot of thinking needed. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
especially in a hammock, looking out at this wonderful view.
it's not bad. - Yeah, not bad at all.
make sure we don't run over the tortoise.
Bye. - Go, go, go!
go, go! - Bye!
although he owns what many would regard as the ultimate fantasy island, the ever-restless Mr. Branson is now chasing his next Caribbean adventure.
watch it. Stay, water!
are your shoes all right? - Yeah, yeah.
necker is not enough.
he's now bought the island next door.
necker cost Richard 60, 000 pounds.
two years ago, he bought Mosquito for a slightly heftier ten million.
he says he wants to transform it into something unique among the thousands of islands across the Caribbean.
Richard, this is a very rocky bit of Mosquito, isn't it?
this side of the island gets big waves, very dramatic.
the other side that we're going round to is a very Robinson Crusoe sort of beach.
we're going to actually see if we can get your shoes off.
if you don't take them off, you're going to get wet.
so this may be the first time that Sir Trevor has ever taken his shoes off on camera.
it's a lovely beach. - It's a beautiful beach.
we have big, wonderful parties here.
right, roll up your trousers. - Good, good.
here we go.
richard has hired some of the world's most eco-friendly architects.
mosquito will aim to be completely self-sufficient, with its own power and water supply.
there'll be 11 guest villas and, of course, a new house for the Bransons.
mosquito will sell luxury with an eco conscience.
and we have, again, great views. - Spectacular views.
and this is... - And this is what it will look like.
so, Richard, if all this works, you are now going to have two islands to choose where you want to spend most of your time. Which will it be?
we... As a matter of principle, we run everything as a business.
a summer home and a winter home. - We could do, but...
no, Necker, erm...
necker we share. It's run as a business and it employs 70 people.
I'm sure we'll do the same with this island as well.
it's a nice position to be in.
it is a nice position to be in. I'm a lucky man.
I've heard of people having one island, but never two.
no, that is true. I'm spoiled, I accept that.
I pinch myself every morning. - So you should. So you should.
I do.
it had been an eye-opening day with Richard Branson on his two islands, and I left with a slight tinge of envy about the lifestyle of a man who runs a multi-billion-pound empire from a hammock.
the Caribbean is an area of extremes.
I left Richard's private paradise islands and headed to a place where billionaires are non-existent.
only 90 miles off the coast of America lies one of the last Communist countries in the world: Cuba.
at Havana Airport, I was met by Juan Hacomino Castilano, a local journalist.
my taxi was a very smart Chevy, built, would you believe it, in 1957.
havana was going to be an adventure.
as part of my journey across the Caribbean,
I have just arrived in the Cuban capital, Havana.
when Fidel Castro overthrew the Batista government and imposed a Communist regime here 50 years ago, the Americans enforced a trade embargo which, amazingly, lasts to this day.
as a result, most things here are half a century old, including many of the cars.
the entire city is enveloped by a sense of faded elegance.
buildings once grand and magnificent show signs of weary neglect.
Juan, the local journalist, was showing me round in a car that is even older than the Communist revolution.
who lives in these buildings now?
regular people. As a matter of fact, this is my neighbourhood.
I live about six or eight blocks from here. - OK.
this is a working class neighbourhood.
but when you say working class, aren't all Cubans more or less working class?
what I'm saying, what I mean is, more of the factory, industry-type workers.
I see. Because it is true that everybody is equal in what they earn, is that right?
it is true, it is true.
how do you find that, Juan? Is that a good idea?
it has its pros and cons. - I should say.
the professionals are suffering.
say, a doctor needs to live on his salary, while if you drive a taxi, you probably make more money.
america makes it difficult for its citizens to come here, but Cuba thrives on tourism.
every year, millions come from all over the world, bringing in the hard currency that helps to keep the country going.
despite its isolation, Cuba prides itself on having one of the best health systems in the world.
the average life expectancy here is 78, as good as in the United States.
but the hand of the state is everywhere.
the television stations, like the rest of the media, are under strict government control.
I went to meet one of the country's main news presenters, interested to see how different daily life was for my Cuban counterpart.
hello. Very nice to meet you. - Hello, Sir. Nice to meet you.
very nice to meet you. Are you just preparing to go on?
Yes. - You go on in about an hour?
at one o'clock. - At one o'clock.
Mariushka Diaz has been reading the news for four years.
she took me on a tour of her news studio.
this is the place... - This is the control room?
how do you do? - Very well, thank you.
everybody wants to kiss you. - I think so.
it doesn't happen to newsreaders in my part of the world, I must confess.
could I see where you sit? You sit there? - Mm-hm.
have a seat, please. - Ah, thank you.
well, I've achieved a great ambition, to sit on the set of a Cuban television station.
it's an honour. - It's a great honour for me.
are you very famous in Cuba? Does everybody know you?
well, so-so...
but do they stop you in the street?
do they ask you for autographs? Do they ask you to sign things?
I have to work in all programmes in Cuban television. people know me.
so everybody knows you? - Yes, I think so.
there is no celebrity culture here, with the exceptions, perhaps, of Fidel Castro and the ubiquitous Che Guevara.
people who work in television, are they enormously well paid?
do they get a lot of money? - No, no, no way, no way. Like other people.
and you do another job in the evenings?
by night I have to go to a... to a cultural place, called Gato Tuerto.
do you do that because you want to or because you think you have to?
well, I want to and I have to.
because of the money? You need the money?
Yes, of course.
the news studio is purely functional.
the presenters put on their own make-up as they prepare for the lunch time bulletin.
Oh, so the top story is the president in Russia, and there's some words from Fidel Castro, too. That's the second story.
now, we have a tradition in the UK of ending the news with something slightly funny, something slightly jokey, something idiosyncratic and out of the ordinary. Do you do that?
Yes, we do that. Sometimes we do that.
I'm delighted to know that the "And Finally" tradition lives on in Cuba, too.
but there were no amusing "And Finally" stories in the Cuban news that day.
the bulletin ended with a report about the 35th anniversary of a school named after the Communist icon, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.
five o'clock next morning and Havana is a hive of activity.
this is a local collection point for workers heading into the city.
the government says the unemployment rate is only around two per cent.
the biggest employer by far is the state.
it provides jobs for over three quarters of the working population.
I joined one group of workers as they clocked on in one of the state's biggest factories, making a rather well-known Cuban specialty... cigars.
the partagas factory has been making cigars for over 150 years, and is the oldest in Cuba.
the 600 employees make three million cigars a year, by hand.
I accompanied one of the workers, Lazaro, as he prepared for his eight-hour shift.
you have many friends here? - Yeah, sure.
he seemed extremely popular.
this is one of my friends. - Ah. Hello.
hello.
lazaro, you know everybody here.
and this is my best friend.
so, do you always greet all those people coming in like that?
Yeah, every time. Every time I go in. - Are they all your friends?
you know, eight hours working together...
now we can go to the raw material department.
you're picking up your stuff? - Yeah.
OK, let's do it.
every day, Lazaro collects his daily quota of tobacco leaves.
during his shift, he will have turned them into some of the world's finest cigars.
tell me something. Is this just the binding?
this is the binder, you know? The wrapper.
but for how many cigars do you think this will be, then?
I can show you here. See.
53 binders and 50, the filler. - OK.
taking his allocation of leaves, he fills them with fine tobacco.
and rolls them to produce cigars that sell for 30 pounds each in the West.
that's more than Lazaro's entire monthly wage packet.
the workers, they can smoke as much as they want.
it's not quite eight o'clock yet, but this guy's already on his first cigar for the day.
despite the constant chatter and the relaxed atmosphere, the work rate seemed impressive.
as a one-time cigar smoker, my resolve was already being sorely tested.
then, something unusual. The chatter stopped and everyone stood to attention.
it was time for the national anthem.
viva la revolucion.
after chants of "Viva la revolucion," the workers returned to their day's task.
but then, another surprise.
the morning's newspaper is read to them, as one of the workers, Ellie, explains.
he reads, every day, the newspaper.
so, for those people who don't have the time to read it, he reads the news.
for them. - That's an excellent idea.
keeps everybody informed. - Yeah.
fantastic. - But it's not only that.
he reads even in the afternoon, at 1: 30.
he'll start reading a book.
Oh, he reads a book? - Every day a chapter.
what kind of books? Are they novels? Or political journals?
it doesn't matter. Three months ago he finished reading The Da Vinci Code.
he read The Da Vinci Code here? - For a long time.
Ellie brought over the book reader to show me what the workers are rolling cigars to this month.
it wasn't exactly a bestseller.
Yes, I can see it's about the history of Egypt and Ramses and so on.
this is a substantial book. It's going to take some time.
how many weeks will this take?
he has been reading for four months.
for four months? - Yes.
and he reads every day ten pages.
Oh, ten pages every day.
imagine reading a book about the history of ancient Egypt to factory workers in Britain.
little has changed in the production line here in half a century.
it still relies on men and women rather than robots and machines, as I discovered when Ellie showed me the other stages of the cigar making process, like removing the veins from the tobacco leaves.
they have to remove about five pound of leaf veins every day.
so it's done very delicately?
that's why most of them are ladies.
he's a man and he's doing it perfectly well. - Yeah, he's a nice guy.
and these are the boxes we know.
these boxes are so familiar. They look so lovely.
these are panatellas.
looking at this reminds me of the pleasure I once had of opening one of these boxes.
it's a lovely feeling. - Yeah, you get it. You forget it.
27 different varieties of cigars are produced here, exported to countries around the world, except, of course, America, where the trade embargo means that Cuban cigars remain unobtainable.
and then the moment I'd been dreading.
you want to try? - It's enough to make me a smoker again.
I think I'll just... Ah! - Try it!
it's wonderful. - This is a wonderful cigar. Don't be afraid.
no, I know. I gave them up a long time ago and I must not return.
just one puff. Only one. Do it for me.
wonderful. - It's an amazing cigar.
now you're going to start smoking for sure. - I hope not.
I left behind the luxurious aroma, the book reader and the constant chatter of the factory, with a genuine admiration for the camaraderie among the workers.
it seemed to me that Cuba's isolation has instilled in its people a real sense of national pride.
but I was about to see a side of the country which to us in Britain would seem unimaginable today.
Cuba feels like an island of stark contrasts:
beautiful city squares and grand colonial buildings overlook scenes of real poverty.
but everywhere I found people fiercely proud to be Cuban.
and nowhere more so than in the numerous bars and clubs of Havana.
I was meeting up again with Mariushka, one of Cuba's main newsreaders.
after her day in the studio, it was time for her evening job,
mc at this local nightclub.
good to see you, too.
so this is the evening job?
Oh, yes. Welcome. This is the Cafe Concert.
Yes, yes. - A very nice place. You'll see.
and what time do you start?
in five minutes. - In five minutes?
I was impressed that Mariushka was as commanding a presence in this downtown club as she was in her news studio.
welcome, Sir. This is a very special place here.
you will enjoy the performance of our best singers.
the next day, I tried to find out a little more of what daily life is like for people in Communist Cuba.
I went to see Juan, who had been showing me around the city.
Hi. Morning, Juan. Good to see you again. - Good to see you.
I wanted to find out how much it costs to live in a two-bedroom flat, close to the centre of Havana.
what does this cost you?
Ah. No, no, very, very little indeed, Trevor, because the price of apartments in Cuba is Government price.
so this apartment, with two bedrooms, kitchen, living room, as you see, a bathroom, of course, the price was about 4, 000 Cuban pesos.
which, in dollars, was about 200 US dollars.
and the rent? - Oh, I don't pay rent.
I paid the full amount of the price of the apartment.
so I don't pay rent. I don't pay for this apartment.
so you virtually bought this place? - I bought it. It's mine now.
it's mine, but I can only sell it back to the government, which I bought it from, because the government doesn't want me to make money out of them.
so you now own this two-bedroom flat, which you bought for 200 dollars.
and this is yours now. - That's correct, Sir.
but flats are not the only thing the government subsidises.
every month, Juan has to pick up his food allocation.
a very nice neighbourhood...
every neighbourhood has a government shop, or bodega, where people collect their rations.
there are grocery stores all around the block, the neighbourhood, so that they are conveniently located.
OK.
our filming trip in Cuba had been carefully monitored, so I wasn't too surprised to find waiting for us an official from the Ministry of Internal Trade.
ministry of Internal Trade. - A-ha!
they heard we were coming. - I see.
so you've come to see what he's doing?
so what's this book?
well, this is the actual ration book. - And it records what you...?
so it records... You can read...
rice, grains... - It makes a record of everything you get?
a record of everything I get for a month and they mark.
the big board shows what people will get this month, and the cost of these subsidised goods.
this is meant for 11 million Cubans getting five pounds of rice every month, from the time they are born until they die.
we eat rice as if we were Chinese, Trevor. We eat a lot of rice.
and food is not the only thing that's subsidised.
do you get free cigarettes?
I am getting subsidised free cigarettes... - I'm not too sure that's a very good idea.
and matches. - Subsidised cigarettes and matches.
Yeah, yeah, everybody.
the bodegueros are quite a character in Cuban neighbourhoods.
there are even songs about the bodegueros.
Really? Because they're so important? - They're very important. They're key.
there may not be a huge variety on the shelves, but it's certainly affordable.
you have to pay now. You mustn't forget that.
all this, one month's supply, for you and your wife, has cost you, at least this lot, under two dollars.
under two dollars. - Under two American dollars.
no problem. No, no, I'll carry this.
food rationing is a daily reality in Cuba.
but what about other goods?
Juan took me to Havana's equivalent of the Lakeside shopping centre.
we went to the biggest electrical goods store in the country.
all that was missing here were some electrical goods.
consumerism not encouraged in Cuba.
Cuba doesn't want to be a consumer society, but a society where people meet their basic needs.
so consumerism is not encouraged? - It is not. It's actually discouraged.
the government puts a massive tariff on many electrical goods.
as a result, the cost of a television is more than Juan paid for his flat.
the average salary, as I understand it, is about 20 dollars a month.
so that it's... - More or less, but...
more or less. So it's very difficult to buy something like this.
Yes.
the Cuban government also bans the sale of some electrical goods outright.
bizarrely, you can't buy a toaster in Cuba.
good evening. Nice to see you again. - You, too.
on my final evening in Havana,
Juan and I went to dinner with Lazaro and Ellie, who we'd met at the cigar factory.
one more flight of stairs. - One more flight of stairs.
makes you look forward to whatever the place is.
well, I hope you like it as much as we do.
we went to La Guarida, the city's finest restaurant.
typically Cuban, it's housed in a crumbling old mansion.
it must have been glorious in its heyday.
even faded grandeur has a certain charm.
Juan, you sit here...
I wondered whether the era of a new American president would bring meaningful change to Cuba.
the sum total of what I get here is that you'd like to see some change, but Cuba very much wants to preserve what it thinks it has, which is very individual to this country, and of value.
and you don't want to see that dispensed with.
this is my country. please don't interfere.
that's something I never understood.
so many people try to say, "No, you have to do this." No, it's not like that.
does the image that you have of Cuba coincide with what you saw in Cuba?
it's a much, much better place than I ever thought.
it's... It's much better run. Its people are more friendly.
and Havana is a much more fascinating city than I ever thought it would be.
well, I think that's a splendid way to end an evening in Havana.
thank you. Yes, I think so.
I felt this place evokes in the visitor a real feeling of old world romance.
people I met seemed anxious to embrace change.
but it appeared to me that they wanted it only on their own terms.
leaving Havana, I headed 1, 500 miles south, to the island where I was born.
I was on my way to Trinidad, the island where I grew up.
at the end of a long Caribbean chain,
trinidad and Tobago sit just seven miles off the coast of South America.
my father came here from nearby Grenada, lured, like so many others before him, by jobs in the oil industry, which has made Trinidad one of the richest islands in the Caribbean.
it's also the most multicultural in the region.
the population are descendents of African slaves who were brought here to work on the sugar plantations, and Indians who were brought by the British after the abolition of slavery.
but people from almost every other race are represented here.
trinidad gained its independence in 1962, but it's always had a robust sense of its own identity.
and nowhere is this more evident than on the biggest day in Trinidad's calendar, Carnival.
the Trinidad Carnival rivals any celebration anywhere in the world.
numerous bands make up the carnival.
each one has its own social or historical theme, and could contain up to a thousand people.
this year, the Africa band is the biggest.
these girls will be on their feet for 15 hours or more.
what's that? Oh, sun stuff. You might need it!
Yeah, I just might. - Cos it's going to be a few hours in the sun.
what about tiredness? Do you ever get tired carrying all that stuff?
you may get a bit tired, but the music keeps you going.
working tomorrow? - Me? No.
I didn't think so, somehow. Why did I guess not?
I don't know.
they ain't seeing me till next week.
not till next week? - Yeah, next Monday.
next Monday? Right. Yes.
the bands are spectacular.
the elaborate costumes can be costly.
how much does a costume like that cost?
my costume was 10, 000.
10, 000 TT dollars? Which is roughly about a thousand English pounds.
Wow!
we need it to get it down to your waist. - Oh, to my waist? Oh, I see. Oh, gosh.
it's too big for you... You have to step into it.
too much work in the gym, you see. That's what it is.
there you go. Now, here you are. Ah, now, that's better.
my goodness me!
a slim waist, you see, that's the thing.
yeah? OK?
this is quite a performance.
here we go. My goodness me.
and now? Complete. A bit of movement. That's amazing!
this is a first.
carnival and its costumes are quintessentially Trinidadian, as is its instantly recognisable musical instrument...
.the steel drum.
how long does that go on until it looks like a half decent pan?
roughly, I would say, about three hours.
three hours? - Yeah.
Yes. Do you still have your hearing after that?
when we reach nine inches, what we do, we put in the measurements of the notes.
we do the layout, the configuration, OK?
roland Harrigan makes the steel drums that are the very heartbeat of Carnival.
and what notes are these? I mean, are these musical notes?
musical notes. - C and D and...?
Yeah. No, Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, like, erm... For instance...
like the notes on a piano. - This is like D. Two Ds.
you got A flats. You got Cs.
can you work that out just from seeing it? - Yeah.
you know this is A flat? And that these two are Ds?
Yeah, these two.
it's amazing that you can tell the notes just by looking. That's extraordinary.
well, to you it would be amazing, but to me it's...
you do it all the time. - We do it all the time.
all right, Trevor... - Ah, now, here are the instruments.
this is where I do my finished product. As you can see...
his drums are in demand all over the world, where they can fetch up to 7, 000 pounds each.
he showed me how he went about fine tuning the instruments.
you must see beauty, see and feel beauty.
you can't be angry and say that you're going to handle this. It wouldn't work.
so you have to be in the right mood? - You always have to be in the right mood.
you can't have had a quarrel before? - No, you got to be close...
in a serious way, you got to be close to God in order to achieve this.
that's a bit going too far, isn't it? - No, no, no, no, no! He created this!
this ain't going a bit too far! It's going quite correct, sir.
I never thought about theology in the business of the steel drum...
it's a spiritual thing. It's a drum, it's a dumb drum you're putting life in. I can't do that.
I take your word. - It's through the Master.
I'm just a vehicle to do this thing.
so you hit... There's a C.
hit D.
these days, teaching the steel drum is part of the national curriculum.
sadly, it was not in my day.
see, that was easy.
even I can do it. - Yeah!
after months of planning, Carnival hits the streets.
trinidad is actually a fairly conservative society, but not during Carnival.
as even our sound man discovered!
are you having a good time? - We always have a good time.
have you always played with this band? - No, it's the first time.
first time? - First time with this band.
are you already planning next year?
well, we live here, so every year we look forward to next year.
you have some white paint on you.
thank you. - Have a great Carnival.
carnival goes back 200 years, to when the island's British rulers held annual masked balls.
banned from joining in, the slaves came up with their own version, mimicking their masters' parties with costumes and masks.
when slavery was abolished, Carnival came out into the open and onto the streets.
wonderful, absolutely wonderful! - Are you back next year?
absolutely without a doubt. - Oh, good.
even if I'm dead, I'll be here in spirit.
well, I hope you're here. - I am going to be here.
watching the festival this year brought back for me a flood of warm memories.
for two days, Trinidadians put all their problems behind them, and lose themselves with abandon in a riot of noise and colour.
they know there'll be a more sober tomorrow, but that simply means 364 days till the next Carnival.
next week,
I visit 3 islands which on the surface couldn't be more different, but like the rest of Caribbean, are defined by money.
I travel to Barbados to meet a man who's said to own a great deal.
go, Philip! Go, Philip!
I mean this is it.
shoot him!
and then onto Jamaica and to downtown Kingston.
those guys have sub-machine-guns.
security people with sub-machine-guns.
strange feeling, knocking to get into a prison.
I'm getting rare access to Fort Augusta where British drug smugglers are in prison.
there's a lot of rats though, Trevor.
Really? - Of a night.
I get the chance to see one of the most expensive private islands in the Caribbean.
Mr. Copperfield, I pressume.
owned by the world famous magician.
david Copperfield.
that's Copperfield Bay, there.
who gave it that name? - I... well, I kind of did. I kind of...
I thought you did.
do you have anything a little different?
l'm not sure l get your drift.
do you have anything with unusual footwear?
high heels? Boots?
leather boots... with laces?
very good, yes. l'll take that.
um, do you have any other material that shows... restraint?
lt's a big favorite among certain customers.
the model is very popular.
do you have any more pictures like this?
l'll have to check the stockroom.
sir, l'm Detective Farrell of the New York Police Department.
we have to ask you a few questions about the material for sale in your shop.
we have reason to believe you are selling obscene and indecent literature on these premises.
any witness who feels that he or she may be embarrassed by the lights or by the TV and movie cameras
they will not be asked to testify for television.
because of the rules of the building, we cannot have smoking in the courtroom.
that is difficult for some, l realize
including the chairman.
since assuming the chairmanship of the Senate Subcommittee to lnvestigate Juvenile Delinquency, l have become increasingly concerned during each passing week with the effect pornographic material has on American adolescents and juveniles, and with the widespread distribution of this insidious filth.
father Egan, you think this pornographic literature is having a substantial and degrading effect?
l certainly do. lt is corrupting.
lt is rotting at the very roots of our nation.
communism will never defeat America.
no, it's something from within
within the nation that will rot and corrupt it.
dear Bettie, how are things in New York City?
we haven't heard from you in a while.
l guess you must be real busy with your modeling career.
here's a picture of you and me at Christmas after church.
lt was nice being together again.
hope you visit soon.
all my love, Goldie.
and they went forth and preached everywhere.
the Lord working with them, confirming the word with signs. " Amen.
l know, friends, that one of these days,
God's gonna call me home.
when he calls, l know it's gonna be-- praise God
to my eternal home.
but before he calls, he's gonna give you the chance to come to him. Yes, friends, don't you know the Lord...
gives every sinner man and every sinner woman the chance to come to him, seek him out?
l feel like singing an invitational hymn now. Brother John?
lf there be any unsaved souls here tonight
who feel like giving their hearts to Christ, come seek him out.
okay.
y'all, Mrs. Craddock is looking.
let her get an eyeful. - Who cares?
do we look like Ziegfeld girls?
girls, get on back in the house!
come on and do your chores. - Come on, let's go inside.
Bettie, l wanna see you.
come on up.
Oh! Oh, why thank you.
uh, ma'am,
are you gonna be all right waiting here like this on your own?
do you have a boyfriend or a husband or something to keep you company while you wait?
well, thank you for your concern, Officer,
but... no, l'm not married.
l'll be fine on my own.
...the fundamental principles of democracy is the people's right - to be represented... " - That's a pretty girl.
you wait here. l'm gonna go ask her for a date.
Billy, you fool, that's Bettie Page. Every guy in town wants to date that girl, but her mother won't allow it.
l'd sure like to meet you, but if l can't, l'd like to meet one of your sisters.
well, you can. They're prettier than me.
that's hard to believe. May l sit down?
well...
Hey!
one of the fundamental principles of democracy is the people's right-- "
did you write that? - Yes, l did.
l'm on the debating team. Got to memorize it by Friday.
l'd like to debate you sometime.
you're probably a lot smarter than me, - but l bet l could put up a good fight. - That's very interesting.
l was never much for studying.
they just passed me in school so l could play ball.
football?
Yeah, l've seen you play
against Hume-Fogg. - That's right.
you're a good ballplayer.
Yes, l am. l'm a good dancer too.
how good are you? - l know a few steps.
lf you come out with me, l'll show you.
well, l'd like to, but-- - Better hurry up.
you're gonna run out of time.
l signed up. - You're going overseas?
that's right-- the army.
well, my mother doesn't approve of dating.
that's a shame.
that's a darn shame.
you tell your mother Billy Neal would like to take you out.
maybe l will.
l'm gonna marry that girl.
no, you ain't gonna marry her. Everybody wants that gal.
l don't know. l'm gonna marry her.
let's see if l can get this right.
Oh. - Whoo.
see you Monday.
l bet it'd look good on you too.
lt's a beautiful night out, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
say, do you like dancing?
my buddy and his girl are going dancing, and they invited me along and l'm starting to feel like a third wheel. l really could use a date.
well, l do like dancing.
love to dance, in fact.
well, my-- my friends are just up the block.
l'd be thrilled if you'd come with us.
Yeah, l think l will if you don't mind.
great.
my name's Scotty. - Bettie.
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
thanks so much.
have you been to the Victory Ballroom?
l love to go there on a Friday night.
the band really cooks.
and l'd just bet you can really dance, can't you?
well, l like to dance.
lf the music's good, l like it.
this is Jake. - Hi.
Hi. - And Ray.
Hi. - Pleased to meet you.
the more the merrier. Ain't that right?
why are we...
leaving the city?
where is this place?
where are we going?
where are we going?!
don't try and run.
Oh, please, for the love of Jesus.
please. - Don't make trouble now.
can't nobody hear you around here anyway.
you know what we're here for.
just get in the back of the car.
please, l can't.
please, it's that time of the month.
shit, l thought you said we were getting some tail here.
well, she'll have to give us some kind of a satisfaction.
dear Goldie, l've decided to make a fresh start in New York City.
l've found an apartment just off Times Square and painted and decorated it myself.
l entered a beauty contest or two.
l won second prize in one, which was not too bad
a set of brand new Revere pots and pans, which l needed very much.
l hope this finds y'all well and healthy and you kids are staying out of trouble.
love to y'all. Bettie. "
can l ask you a question? - Well
don't be nervous. l'm a policeman. Let me show you my badge.
see?
l was just curious
have you ever done any photographic modeling?
well, not for photographs.
well, you look like a model. l'm a policeman, but l'm a photographer too-- on weekends, you know?
lf you let me take your picture, l'll give you copies for free.
take my photo? Right here? - Sure, why not?
looking like this? - Sure.
l don't know.
you're a southern girl, aren't you?
well, l don't wanna make you feel uncomfortable.
Oh, no no, it's not that.
don't get me wrong. l worked with a colored woman, and she was real nice. lt's just
well, l
Oh, what's the harm in it?
come on, over here. - Good.
l don't think the kids should see this.
good, Bettie. So where're you from in the South?
Nashville, Tennessee.
Ah, home of the Grand Ole Opry. - You know it?
l hear it on the radio sometimes.
my wife listens to it now and then.
could you lift your chin up for me, please?
a little more.
good. Now, uh...
head up and to the right.
great, Bettie.
good.
Hey, Officer.
uh...
well, it seems as if some of the people here aren't happy about me taking your picture, Bettie.
well, they're just prejudiced.
l used to be when l was younger, but l grew up and l learned better.
all we're doing is taking pictures. - There's kids here.
maybe next time we should use my studio.
let's go.
good.
good.
uh, give me friendly.
now, give me pert. Good.
one more.
and give me haughty.
good, Bettie. Good.
now, could you turn to the side for me, please?
l'd like to see your figure in profile.
okay.
all right. Now, this is a trick that a lot of photographic models use.
lf you put this in your swimming suit top, it will enhance your bustline.
this is all lumpy.
well, you have to put it underneath.
Oh...
Oh.
good. Now give me saucy.
good, Bettie.
great, Bettie. Great!
Yeah, the poses are great. Now, l have an idea.
would you mind if l changed your hairstyle?
come, please. You have a high, round forehead.
there's nothing wrong with it, but it catches the light.
but if we covered it...
it wouldn't catch the light, and it frames your face.
Yeah, l see what you mean.
yeah? Shall we try? - Sure.
austin, Green & Dunleavey. How may l help you?
Yes, sir. l'll connect you right away.
Hi, l'm Bettie. - l'm Art. Step this way.
did Jerry tell you what the setup is?
you can change in there. The other girl still has a half hour to go.
that's Maxie. You can learn from her.
she knows all about the three essentials
clothes, pose and expression.
clothes, pose and expression. " - Over here, over here.
Maxie, this way. - And look over here.
over here. - Down here to the right.
you'll get your turn. - Maxie, we're dying over here.
don't forget us boys in the corner.
Oh. - Very good, Maxie.
can you bend over on one leg?
no, like this. - Hey!
Hey, no touching! Do it again and you're out on your rear.
you don't have to worry about that.
there's no funny business here. l see to that.
you think you can do it?
l can sure try.
let's see that smile, kid.
turn to me.
lift that leg a little bit.
Yeah. And higher.
Mmm... - That's nice.
l saw it. l saw beaver.
you're dreaming. lt was a shadow. - l saw it.
Mm-hmm. - What's her name?
lt's Bettie. - Hey, Bettie.
can you bend over for us a little bit?
please? - Show us your keister?
Hello, keister. - Very nice.
nice.
that's good.
to want or need a mask to hide behind
comes from a distrust of ourselves.
lt comes from our fear that we ourselves are boring.
all right. Now, let's try to go back to that first object exercise
recreating two minutes of ordinary life when we're alone. Bettie, would you like to show us what you've been working on?
the curtain rises and you are sitting on stage.
you are alone. You sit...
and sit. At last, the curtain comes down.
nothing could be simpler, could it?
the curtain rises...
the curtain comes down.
Bettie, my angel, it's not necessary to remove your clothes.
l'd like to try the exercise next if l may.
okay, Marvin. Ahem.
curtain rises.
curtain down. You see,
Marvin sat...
and waited, and did not act anything.
now, it may not seem interesting to you, to sit and wait as you do it, but it's life.
now, that's all for today. l'll see you on Wednesday.
Thanks.
Hey, don't worry, Bettie.
lt's like he said-- it was a hard exercise.
l was terrible.
l couldn't concentrate. l felt silly.
no, no. l liked what you did.
l thought it was really interesting and very modern.
don't feel bad.
Hey, how about a milkshake?
that was back when l was trying to write a great American novel.
lt all seems so juvenile. You know, trying to be Ernest Hemingway.
but then a friend dragged me to Herbert's class, and, l don't know, acting just felt so...
inspiring. - l know exactly what you mean.
lt's like when you're in church. - Uh-huh.
well, sometimes with the preaching and the singing and all, you get lifted up-- up out of yourself.
lt's like you're taken to another place.
Yeah! Taken to another place, that's it.
Bettie, l feel like l've been talking about myself for hours.
so what about you? What drew you to acting?
well, l started in high school and did all the plays. l guess you could say - it ruined my life. - How so?
well, l was gonna be our high school valedictorian.
everyone said it was gonna be me.
the valedictorian gets a full scholarship to Vanderbilt University.
lt's a real big deal. - Hmm.
well, one day l-- l had a dress rehearsal and l cut one class-- one stupid art class.
so l got an A-minus instead of an A, and Martin Murphy got the scholarship.
and l got to be salutatorian and a place at a teacher training college.
and l hated teaching. All the boys whistled at me and acted up.
l just couldn't control the class.
l wanted that scholarship so much.
jeez, l'm sorry, Bettie.
Hey, you know, lt seemed so bitter at the time, but maybe it's fate telling you you were meant for something else.
well, l wonder.
l hope you're right about that.
Yes. Like this?
look at that over there. Here we go again.
l know it's coming.
listen, girls, l just want you to know
that Peggy is gonna be doing - some semi-nude posing today. - All very tasteful, of course.
lf you're feeling shy about that, bathing suits are just dandy with us.
although there's nothing more beautiful than nude modeling in open air.
art, l've told you, my boyfriend would blow his top if l did that.
of course, of course. lt's completely up to you.
thank you, Art, Frank.
we appreciate you telling us.
beautiful.
you know, sometimes when l get homesick, l just go to Central Park and walk around for hours.
gee, l like to do that too.
some people think l'm funny for spending so much time alone.
Oh, no, Bettie. You're in very good company.
many of the world's greatest thinkers spent most of their time alone.
they did? Well, l'll be.
l'm roasting. Do you wanna call it quits?
Oh, no, l'm fine. l love the sun.
well, we'd better move into the shade after these shots though.
you don't want get a mark from your bathing suit straps.
well, thank you, Charlie. That's very thoughtful of you.
you know, l could take this little old bathing suit top off if you like.
Really? Oh, sure, yeah.
if you don't mind. - Well, l've been thinking about it...
and what difference does it make, a little piece of cloth?
l agree. Absolutely.
Oh, thank you.
you know, Bettie,
you're the most popular model at our club.
flattery is the devil's tool, Charlie.
how's this?
l don't know how to say this, and don't be offended, but...
well, we've come this far...
do you think you could take off the bottom as well?
after all, it's just a little piece of fabric.
now, don't you go throwing my words back at me, Charlie.
l'm-- l'm sorry. l shouldn't have asked.
just kidding you. lt's fine.
sure, l don't mind.
um, um...
Bettie?
Bettie? - Yes?
lf we show too much, l could get arrested.
what do you mean? - The top is okay, but you have to hide that.
Oh...
Oh, l'll just put the bottoms back on.
no no no, you don't have to do that.
um, the backside's okay.
how's this?
Oh, thank you. That's perfect.
a copy of " She: the Man's Picture Magazine. "
Oh, Marvin.
A-ha, there she is.
ln roller-skates this time. - l know, they're silly.
gals think men are beasts!
this doll thinks a gorilla makes a safer boyfriend. You wolf! "
l'm not sure l like the idea of other men seeing you like this.
lt's a bathing suit, Marvin.
you make it look so good. - Come on.
Yeah, l know. l know.
yes-- yes? - Hi.
l got your name from Maxie. My name's Bettie Page. l'm a model.
Oh, yeah. She told me about you. Just one minute.
Yeah, we got some nice William Holden. Color 8x10.
Yeah, Stewart Granger we got, yeah.
just come into the store. Anything you want, we got, okay?
thank you so much. - All right.
so Maxie told you about us? - Yes.
she said there would be some unusual costumes to put on.
okay, great. Why don't you go right upstairs and talk to my brother lrv while l close up here, okay?
Klaw Studios featuring the largest variety of popular model photos in the world.
well, what are you interested in?
films, cartoons, pictorials?
we got some great new pictorials in, very high quality
just a moment. Hi, l'm lrving Klaw,
you hungry? We've got sandwiches over there
some beautiful sliced brisket. - Oh, l'm fine, thanks.
okay.
dressing room's through there.
uh, no more " Boudoir Beauties in High Heels. "
what about some fighting girl movies? No?
bound in Rubber, " " Pleasure Parade, "
and " Fearful Ordeal in Restraintland. "
now, that last one's an excellent seller, because of the quality of the poses, which in my personal opinion are among the most strenuous bondage photos ever made.
Whoa-whoa, how anyone walks in these old shoes is beyond me.
you don't have far to go. Jack, give her a hand.
Oh, hello. - Pleased to meet you.
nice to meet you. - These shoes are kind of unusual.
we get a lot of requests for them, don't we, lrving?
sure do-- 8 " stiletto heels, black seamed stockings, 1 2 different poses. High heels are very popular.
there you go. - Okay, sit her down there, Jack.
all right, Bettie. Let's go.
beautiful, Bettie.
Oh! l think we got a little problem. Something's peeking out.
Oh, yep. We better put another pair over them.
Yeah, we gotta put these over the ones you got on.
these will be okay, huh? As if the customers care.
lt's the shoes they want. Shoes and boots, boots and shoes
they can't get enough of them. - Why?
don't ask. lt takes all types to make a world.
what kind of types?
you see, the customers who want this stuff, they're very respectable, very high quality people
doctors, lawyers, diplomats...
even a judge. They're not people like us.
the pressures they've got-- they're not your average Joe.
so what if they want something that seems a little strange, right?
lf it makes them happy? - Sure.
sometimes they come into the store, and l can see they want something different.
Lrving says l can spot them a mile off.
Oh, she can. She's got an instinct. - lf l think it's shoes they want, l'll pull out a movie star-- Lana Turner, let's say, with a nice pair of high heels-- and l'll point to them and say, " Hmm, something like this, maybe? "
Oh, the look on their face-- like they're so relieved l understand.
and then l start pulling out the special stuff.
look at the time. We gotta go.
Jack, let's put some music on. - Okay.
let's put some music. You like music, Bettie?
Oh, yeah. - You okay, Bettie? The shoes hurting?
l'm fine. Just fine.
turn your backside to us so we can see the stocking seams.
nice nice.
wonderful, Bettie.
to me, turn to me. Great!
lt's nice, right? Just get into it, feel it.
gorgeous gorgeous. Oh, you're so happy.
she's great.
Oh, that's right, honey.
do that cha-cha, give me that.
great, Bettie. Gorgeous.
listen to this-- " you have long stretches of nervous letdown in playing your part, complete artistic impotence.
at such times your playing is lifeless, stilted. "
l think he was talking about me there.
no, no, he's talking about all of us.
l'm just so nervous. Uh, they liked the photographs l sent them, - but they never heard me speak. - lt's a western, right?
Uh-huh. - Well, maybe they'll need a good Southern girl. Just remember, acting is about truth.
you find truth in the character and no one will give a damn - that you're from Tennessee. - Settle down.
okay, start from here.
come on, turn.
not-- slowly slowly, not so quick.
and look at me with your beautiful eyes.
now, this way.
straight.
now, say something nice.
um...
l don't know know what to say.
come on, we're recording sound so you can say something.
l'm sorry. - Don't be so sorry, okay?
you're behaving like a six-year-old, okay?
come on, look at me with your beautiful eyes.
And?
ahem...
Hi, l'm Bettie Page.
um...
l'm from Nashville, Tennessee.
right. Okay, that's it. You're all done, sweetie.
l thought you looked really great under the lights.
you're a knockout. Real star material.
uh, you think so? l was awfully nervous.
you'll have to work on that accent, of course,
but it would be no fun if you were perfect.
say, why don't you have dinner with me tonight?
l could give you a few pointers. We could get to know each other better.
Oh, l'm sorry, but l can't. l already have a boyfriend.
Oh, come on. lt'll be fun.
lt's always an advantage to know the producer personally.
l really have to go.
you try and do a girl a favor...
still not tight enough.
l told you, it won't go any tighter. l've been trying for 20 minutes.
you'll ruin the whole thing because you're too lazy to do it properly.
Oh, come off it.
set the shot up the way l told you. - Okay, l got it, l got it.
Bettie, you're supposed to be here at 10: 00.
you're not on the clock, you don't get paid. lrving, you're in the shot.
okay. - Ahem.
give it in the eyes. Give it in the eyes, darling.
beautiful. - Can we see a bit of heel maybe?
a little bit of heel. - Uh, that's good,
a little bit of bum. l really like bum.
that's perfect. - Lovely bum, darling.
see, she's one of our best.
and then he admitted that he paid Roz 1 2 bucks an hour,
and they gave me 10. Cheek of it!
so l says to lrving, " Pardon me, but who's been freezing her derriere off every Saturday for the past six months? Not Roz Greenwood.
gee, that's not fair. Roz is real nice, but you're a better model.
everyone says so. - Hey, girls, how you doing?
Yeah, we're cold. Can we get another heater in here?
l'll see what l can do. Bettie, if you keep brushing your hair, it'll fall out of your head. Let me explain something to you.
this is one of our private sessions-- John.
we call him " Little John " to tell him apart from the other John, " Big John. "
he's the photographer out there.
anyway, Little John has some special outfits he'd like you to put on.
l'd say they're special. - Maxie.
Yeah, all right, some of them are a real hoot, but he's a very nice man.
Yeah, he's not normal, - but he's nice. - he's one of our best customers,
so will you try and do what he says?
what does she mean? - Oh, it's nothing bad,
you just have to scare him and act mean. Like this.
actually, it's kind of fun.
you're lucky. Wait until you see what l have to do.
Hey! Ouch, that's too tight.
well, that is rather the point, my dear. The tighter the better.
Paula. - Maxie, are they hurting you?
she's all right. Aren't you, Maxie? - l am not.
l'm getting rope burns. - All right. Let's get a move on.
Bettie, stand over there.
l'd like this young lady to look very strict.
he'd like her to look very strict.
he'd like you to look very strict.
come on, my dear, more passion. Fire.
more... tigress, huh?
whoa, very good.
dominate the men who adore you.
crush them with your exquisite high heels!
come, fill the cup. And in the fire of spring the winter garment of repentance fling. "
Oh, that's very nice. ls that from a poem?
not just a poem, my dear, the poem-- " The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. "
whoa-- oh, no, thank you. l don't drink.
come on, have a drink with me.
most of the time these last six months, l seem to be drinking by myself or with strangers whom l don't much like.
might l tempt you with a mushroom cap?
Oh. So what do you do, Little John?
he has a very successful legal practice - with many distinguished clients. - How is business, John?
you been keeping busy? - Uh, quite busy,
but mother hasn't been very well
so l've been spending a lot of time at home with her.
sorry to hear it.
and what about those legal difficulties you mentioned?
l had a letter from the postal inspector warning me about sending some of my pictures through the mail. What do you know - about getting around that? - The only court ruling that l know of on that issue is the case of this fellow, Al Urban.
the post office tried to prevent him from sending photographs of nude men through the mail.
they got the Civil Liberties Union involved
and the Chicago court eventually ruled that the materials - were not obscene. - We don't even have nudes.
he just had to be careful he was only sending his stuff to adults.
tell me, what do you think of all this tying-up business?
you seem to have a knack for posing.
and l'm always on the lookout for comely wenches who don't mind a bit of the old rope and gag.
well, it certainly was different.
l liked what you did with that riding crop.
lt's a treat to see a girl with so much spirit.
Oh, l enjoy acting very much.
l've been taking lessons.
Oh... we shall have to put you in a little film or something, shan't we?
little John old cock,
I was born in the Caribbean, and even though I spent the first 30 years of my life here,
I know so little about the 7, 000 islands that make this area so extraordinary.
stretching from the coast of Florida down to South America, the Caribbean's history and its mix of people and cultures make it like no other place on Earth.
the pristine private islands, the no-go areas, the stunning beauty, and the violent natural disasters, the Caribbean has it all.
Hi, Sir Trevor!
good to see you again. How are you? Good to see you.
there we go, my goodness me.
in this series, I've been travelling 2, 000 miles across the entire Caribbean, to explore the contrasts of these incredible islands.
from communist Cuba...
it's not eight o'clock and this guy's on his first cigar for the day.
I've heard of people having one island, but never two.
to a billionaire's private island.
when you're up close like this, it looks like a prehistoric ritual.
I get a rare glimpse of giant turtles laying eggs in Grenada.
I track down someone surprising in the Bahamas.
Hitler! How are you?
his brother is Elvis.
your brother is Elvis? I think that almost makes up for it.
I visit a former paradise wiped out by a massive volcanic eruption.
you read about these things, but you never think they have this effect.
I can't quite believe it.
this is the Caribbean as I have never seen it before.
this week, I'll be visiting three islands, which, on the surface, couldn't be more different, but like the rest of the Caribbean, are defined by money.
those who'll do anything to get it, and those who have so much, they don't know how to spend it.
I go to Jamaica, perhaps the most famous of the Caribbean islands, blighted by violence and drugs.
and then, on to Barbados to meet a man whose enormous wealth enables him to behave exactly as he pleases.
shoot him!
these dazzling blue waters and perfect beaches make the Bahamas a Mecca for tourists.
some of its tiny islands are the wealthiest in the Caribbean.
400 years ago, these islands were a haven for adventurers, like Blackbeard the Pirate, before they were colonised by the British.
the Bahamas are now independent, but many of its 700 islands have been bought by wealthy foreigners, often from America, just 60 miles away.
I was on my way to see one of the most luxurious and expensive private islands of them all, owned by the world-famous magician and illusionist, David Copperfield.
the resort's host, Claus Becker, has worked for David for two years.
you know, you hear about the beautiful blue Caribbean sea, but you never realise just how beautiful it is.
david always says that magic, to him, is not just making things appear and disappear, but he believes in magic as being magical.
when he got introduced to this chain, he thought this was magical.
david Copperfield owns 11 islands which make up the resort of Musha Cay.
guests have access to all 11, for a quarter of a million dollars a week.
Mr. Copperfield, I presume.
did you have a nice journey? - It was excellent.
thank you so much. - There you go. Welcome.
it's a pleasure to meet you. - My pleasure.
these are the landings. This is where we have one of our many dinners.
many locations for dinner.
and you have, at any one time for dinner, how many people?
24 people at a time.
who are these people who can afford to come to these marvellous islands?
amazingly, a lot of people, believe it or not.
um, you know, it's the people that you've heard of.
you know, lots of famous actors and, um, business leaders.
but, surprisingly, a lot of people that want to have a big anniversary, or big festive occasion.
a big, costly anniversary.
it does cost money, but it's amazing how expensive it is to run an island.
you have to remember, we have to bring in our own fuel, we have to make our own water here, everything. It's like a whole country.
visitors here are looked after by a staff of over 30, who cater to their every need.
there's everything you'd expect from a quarter of a million dollar a week resort, and a few surprises, too.
like this museum dedicated to David's hero.
he's obviously the big name in magic, but was he really the greatest?
he was a great escape artist, you know, really a terrific person, that actually created the whole idea of escaping from things.
you have moved this whole art on, amazingly.
I've tried to.
no, you've done better than try, making the Statue of Liberty disappear, walking through the Great Wall of China.
you have moved it on amazingly.
I... We have fun with it.
then from this room, you look out on this...
that's Copperfield Bay, there.
who gave it that name? - I...well, I kind of did. I kind of...
I thought you did. - I did.
many Caribbean islands acquired their names when Columbus came here 500 years ago.
today, if like David Copperfield you have enough money, you too can buy and give your name to a piece of the Caribbean.
few places on Earth are more accommodating to the super rich.
this is where I shall be tonight.
this is lovely. What a... Gosh.
people who come here must hire all 11 islands.
they are obviously prepared to pay a huge premium for complete privacy.
who else might be able to afford this?
I'm not allowed to mention names, contractually, but probably the biggest internet person you could think of, the biggest computer person you could possibly name.
I think we've got a clue. - Yes.
the biggest American TV hostess that has the most money...
Yes, I think I have a clue there, too.
I'm now absolutely convinced that I've developed a great inferiority complex having you tell me, your having told me about all these people.
no, no, no. You're in good company.
you have your own private beach, here.
my own private beach!
what I've always wanted.
and a private pier with no boats.
at night time, no light pollution, you look up at the stars they are just amazing.
I can come and sit here? - Just sit here.
david bought these islands five years ago for $50 million.
but that's actually less than he reportedly earns in a single year from playing 500 shows around the world.
was it love at first sight?
when did you first see these islands and thought, "I must have them"?
well, I found them in a very unusual way.
um...
I took...magical locations from around the world.
in your country, Stonehenge. - Yeah.
I drew a line from Stonehenge to the statues of Easter Island in Chile...
right.
on a globe.
and, I drew another line from the Statue of, um...I'm sorry, from the Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, to the Pyramid of the Sun in Mexico.
so, I had a line going this way and a line going the other way.
I'm waiting to hear what this has to do with these islands.
it makes an X and the X is right there.
right.
but while you explained that, you make it sound ever so cold.
I mean, didn't you look at these wonderful places and say, "Gosh, what beauty! What great fun it would be to have them.
that's exactly what I said.
on my map, those lines actually cross closer to the Canary Islands, but Mr. Copperfield isn't the first person to get his Caribbean geography confused.
Columbus thought he'd found India when he came here, and so christened the islands the West Indies.
we're heading to one of the most magical places on Earth, I think.
it's our amazing sand bar.
two miles long of pure white sand in the middle of nowhere.
so, it's in the middle of the ocean, but here you are, up on dry land on a sand bar.
it's pretty much like heaven probably is. I hope.
there you go. - Here we go.
if I was expecting another illusion, the sand bank, magical in appearance, was real enough.
if only for a few hours every day, at low tide.
this is a first for me.
I've never walked on a bit of dry land in the middle of an ocean before.
is this one of the things that charmed you about the island?
Yes, this is an amazing, one-of-a-kind, special place.
Wow. Well, this is...
I mean, to use one of your favourite words, pretty magical.
if you have the cash, the Caribbean allows you to design your own tropical paradise, and that's exactly what David Copperfield has done here.
with success, wealth and luxury, he has created the ultimate illusion that sitting here on an evening lit by a golden sun, all the world's problems disappear.
if Musha Cay felt unreal,
I was about to encounter the harsher realities of Caribbean life.
my next island stop was one of the most vibrant, but also one of the most violent in the region.
Jamaica has always had a very close association with Britain.
the names of the counties echo those of what was once the mother country.
the beauty of its landscape is justifiably famous.
but Jamaica does have a dark side...as I was about to discover.
if the Caribbean is a region of extremes, Jamaica proves it.
high up in the hills of Kingston, rich Jamaicans live well.
this neighbourhood is even called Beverly Hills.
down in the valley, it's a very different story.
massive debts incurred in the 1990s plunged the country into economic paralysis.
there's widespread poverty and crime.
for many Jamaicans, life is tough and often brutal.
I went to downtown Kingston with Colin Smikle, an ex-gang-member turned social worker.
they had sub-machine-guns. Security people with sub-machine-guns.
I haven't seen that a lot around, except in Beirut some years ago.
that's standard here now.
Really? - Yeah.
it's high-calibre weapons cos people are so afraid, and that's their solution to the problem.
more fire power, you know.
more fire power? - More fire.
we were heading into Coronation Market.
you'll find no tourists here.
like many areas in Kingston, this market is controlled by gangs.
the police are not welcome, nor are cameras, but Colin had arranged our safe passage.
it's the biggest market in the city, selling every variety of fruit and vegetables, brought in from the surrounding countryside.
on the surface, it was all very friendly.
how is business today?
business is going on fire, because these tomatoes them going off of the stall.
what happened to the tomatoes?
they're selling so fast. - They're selling so quickly?
Yes. You come late.
but it soon became apparent that people here live by their own rules.
marijuana is illegal in Jamaica, and anyone selling it can be jailed for over 30 years.
yet it was being openly sold.
the gangland battles to control the drugs trade, means that the murder rate in Jamaica is a staggering 30 times that of Britain.
the dominant culture here is that of the gun, as Colin knows to his cost.
I was shot right here.
were you? - Yeah. Right there.
you were shot right there? - Right there.
how did it happen? - I was walking down the road.
did they know you?
somebody who knew me or somebody... came up behind me...
you were shot in the leg? - Back.
in the back? - Yeah.
you're lucky to be alive. - Yeah.
Colin took me to Nannyville, an area of downtown Kingston ruled by the gangs, with an appalling history of violence.
in your experience, how bad did it get?
you had borders. You couldn't go across a certain lane or street.
so some people couldn't move from one community to another?
exactly.
if you did move, what would the consequence be?
well, anything from a cursing to death.
to death? - People have died.
how many people died?
our average murder rate now is over 1 , 500 a year.
over 1,500 a year? - Yeah.
Yes, that's pretty high. - Yes.
some people are standing up to the gangs.
Colin told me about two courageous young women.
Danille and Tisha live only five minutes away from each other, but the rules of the street meant they could never have met, let alone become friends, until music changed their lives.
they joined Area Youth, a project aimed at bringing young people in the ghettos together by playing music.
what did you think of each other before you met?
the first time I saw Tisha...
I thought she was a skettel.
a what? - A skettel.
what's a skettel?
one of those girls that don't have any pride, no ambition whatsoever.
OK. Wow. - Yes.
you obviously didn't think very much of her.
could that kind of attitude start a conflict?
Yes!
how serious?
because when I say that, it's going to offend her.
she's going to want to say something, and I'll be saying back something.
I'll be all up in her face and say, "Touch me now. Touch me now.
Yes. Yes.
well, I've known people behave in a similar way, but it doesn't always come to that kind of conflict.
well, not all Jamaicans.
most of them. - Majority.
them get very hostile towards one another.
Yes. - Yes.
area Youth got the gang leaders together, and persuaded them to let them run their project where, previously, there was gang warfare.
the gang's godfathers are now so supportive of this truce, that they are prepared to go to extremes to make sure it's kept.
anybody who breaks that peace is going to pay the consequences.
what consequences?
mm, now that's a very bad price. You're going to get killed.
no. Seriously? - Not necessarily.
or they will beat you, because you're not supposed to break the peace.
all right, this is peace that comes at a heavy price if it's broken?
Danille and Tisha's passion and their optimism were remarkable, for two very young women who grew up and live in inner-city Kingston, where illiteracy is high, and where 75 percent of the people are thought to be unemployed.
Hi, Sir Trevor!
later that afternoon, I met up with the girls and the other members of the Area Youth band.
they promised to give me a private performance of their hit song.
I was given a front-row seat. Well...a front-row tree.
comfortable? - Absolutely.
it's six o'clock and the sun goes down
someone is killed without guilt
baby in the crib was what it was
shot in the head and now he's dead
when you think of a mother crying over her first-born child
Oh, why I bother
I wanna shut this world down
Whoa-oh
we need to stop the killing
everybody, we can start feeling
so why with all our love and care
what about the things we used to share?
all this pain and hurt we bear
we need to stop we need to stop
sometime I feel the pressure, more time I feel the vibes
at time, never stare wide, open up my eyes
stand up to liberty, it never be surprised
that's what I come to look like, really lose this eye
cos everyone who come say peace not reached
cos man, I shot down, come and pick me up, police
you are a bad niece to the youth that my teach
and parents not practise what they preach
we need to stop the killing
we need to stop we need to stop
that really bad!
one of the lines of that song, you talked about a baby in a crib or something, who died.
did that actually happen?
Yeah, over by Rockfort. - Yes.
a baby was shot...in a crossfire.
and, gosh, a very young child. How old?
er, a nine-month-old baby? - Yeah, nine months.
so, all your songs are for peace?
it's reality.
we sing about things that actually happen, and we're telling the public that we want it to stop, because we can't bear it any more.
the inspirational Area Youth are the latest in a long line of artists who've tried to rise above the violence and poverty of Kingston.
the most famous of all was, of course, Bob Marley.
I drove up into the hills to the home of Island Records founder, Chris Blackwell.
this is where Bob Marley came to convalesce in 1976, after he himself was shot, a victim of gang violence.
I wondered whether Danille and Tisha would ever be totally free of their area's violence, to carry forward Bob Marley's legacy of preaching peace and one love.
Jamaica is frequently labelled the drugs capital of the Caribbean.
marijuana is cultivated here, and the island is an acknowledged transit point for cocaine, grown in South America and heading for the West.
but the authorities are not complacent.
I was on my way to meet a number of recently convicted drug smugglers.
I'd been given a rare opportunity to visit Jamaica's Fort Augusta, the country's only women's prison, that holds British girls caught trying to smuggle drugs to the UK.
strange feeling, knocking to get into a prison.
may I come in? - You're with the film?
Yes, I am. Yes. Thank you.
fort Augusta is just that, a fort, built by the British, 200 years ago.
hello. - Good morning.
can we go through?
are you checking the time I've come in?
Yes, I have to.
I hope you're here to report the time that I leave.
thank you so much.
today, this is one of only three maximum-security prisons in Jamaica.
superintendent Kelly was to accompany me at all times.
260 women are incarcerated here.
along with prisoners serving life for murder, there are 19 British women all doing time for drug smuggling.
Samantha Benjamin from Nottingham is one of them.
how long have you been here? - I've been here for...a month now.
and how long is your sentence? - Erm, I'll be going in May.
you go back home in May? - Yes. It was a short sentence.
a short sentence? - Yeah.
what for? - Erm, smuggling.
so what were you smuggling? - Cocaine.
why did you do that?
needs. Needs.
what? The thought of lots of money? - Yes. Basically, yeah.
what was your sentence?
must say, I was very, very lucky. God was on my side. I got six months.
I know other people that have done the same as me and they got two or three years.
so, I was very lucky. one of the lucky ones.
how come?
I don't know, maybe the judge just liked my face.
maybe he liked my face, I don't know, but he had pity on me that day.
do you remember the moment you were apprehended for trying to smuggle in drugs?
Yes, I do, it's something I replay in my head all the time.
what if I had done this? What if I had done that?
you know, when it first happened... - Did it happen at the airport?
Yes. When it first happened, I just sat there and thought, "Why am I sitting here?" , because I didn't have to do this.
it was, it's just my attitude, I'm a spontaneous person.
you said you had children? - Yes, I've got a son who is two.
I missed his birthday. I was here on the 22nd of February, which was his birthday, which was very, very hard.
and I've got a daughter who is seven.
I had to write her a letter and explain to her why I was out here and it took me three days to write that letter because...what was I going to put?
painful and very difficult.
Yeah. So, I told her that "Jesus needs some time with Mummy.
that's how I explained it. - That's ingenious.
Jesus needs some time with Mummy because Mummy needs to find herself.
and when Mummy comes back, she will have lots of blessings to pass on to you.
so, although I've made a mistake, God's still on my side.
thank you. - You're welcome.
nice meeting you. - Nice to meet you.
superintendent Kelly told me that the British women here are very much on the bottom rung of the drug-smuggling ladder.
they are probably asked to do it by other people.
other persons.
I suppose that's the problem about the drugs trade.
that you catch one slice of it, but the real people who are the operators behind the scene...
well, I would say a very thin slice.
a very thin slice? -Yeah.
cos, actually, some persons I caught, when you speak to them, they don't even know who they're working for.
Really?
as word of my visit went around, other British prisoners came forward.
hello. - Morning, sir. Good morning, Trevor.
Hello, how are you? - I've always seen you on the news.
Yes. - You've got grey hair now.
you have been seeing me since I had black hair?
Yeah. - You're not that old.
I'm 44 years old. - Oh, gosh, you look very young.
how did your action happen? - I'm guilty of three pounds of ganja, but I got set up by the guys who gave me the ganja, they hid cocaine in my suitcase. So, instead of me carrying...
you didn't know? - No, I didn't.
I knew I was carrying ganja, but I didn't know about the cocaine.
many here were first-time offenders, and very remorseful.
it was sad seeing these young women wasting away precious years in a Jamaican prison 4, 000 miles from home.
Lucy Wilkes from Birmingham was caught smuggling 29 pounds of marijuana last year and sentenced to 12 months.
it's hard at first.
you know, when you first come here, it is hard.
and, to get used to the food, the water...
I come out in spots all over my face, big bumps, you know.
I don't know if it was the change in water, the change in environment.
how old are you? - I'm 22. I was 22 last month.
my 22nd birthday.
what's it like celebrating your birthday in prison?
an experience and a half.
Yeah.
I forgot it was my birthday, you know.
I woke up and I forgot it was my birthday.
I forgot.
Lucy told me conditions in the prison were tough.
there's a lot of rats though, Trevor. - Really?
of a night, when everybody's quiet and everybody's asleep, they rule.
that's when the rats come out? - They're smart. They rule.
they're very clever things, you know.
they rule this place of a night.
what are you looking forward to doing when you go back to Britain?
erm...
what am I looking forward to do? Just get back into my lifestyle.
what was that like? - What was it like?
a book and a half.
to be honest, I don't want to get up to the things I used to get up to.
well, I hope what's in store is nothing like you did to get here.
I hope as well.
I think... - God knows.
I think you must more than hope. - Well, yeah, more than hope.
you must try and make sure. - I'll remember that, sir.
I don't want to sound like a counsellor. I'm not, so I wouldn't do that.
don't listen to me, but I think... - I'm glad I've met you, Trevor.
well, I'm glad to have met you, shame about the circumstances.
you look good, though.
Oh, thank you. - Yeah.
thank you. I take that as a compliment.
superintendent Kelly, thank you very much for allowing us to do that.
thank you so much.
all the British women had been incredibly candid with me about how they came to be at Fort Augusta.
perhaps it was because I represented a little bit of home, or perhaps because I was almost certainly their first visitor from England.
to see some of the more legitimate crops grown in Jamaica, the next morning, I found myself 2,000 metres up a perilous mountain road.
at the end of this road can be found one of Jamaica's rarest exports.
this is the home of Blue Mountain coffee, one of the most expensive in the world.
the terrain here is challenging and frequently unforgiving.
increasingly, hurricanes devastate plantations and ruin their owners.
david Twynam and his family have run a farm here for some 40 years.
what extraordinary weather.
it was very clear, and then, just like that, it clouded over.
how often does this happen?
most days. - Most days?
and sometimes all day. - Wow.
and it's, er... Sometimes this is the only view that you get.
blue Mountain coffee is among the most expensive in the world simply because it's so very difficult to produce.
the coffee is grown on 45-degree slopes, making picking the beans precarious.
it must be difficult business growing it here in these conditions, then?
it is, I think it is that edge that's it's on that makes it very difficult.
the weather, the soil, the climate, the heavy rainfall.
the mist that we see makes for a very long growing season, which is what makes the coffee so exceptional.
but, as well as that, it's the challenge of growing coffee in times of hurricanes.
Yes, that's not easy in this sort of, in these hills, because...
well, we're very exposed.
my goodness, it's clearing.
all of a sudden, we now have a view, a little bit of sunshine.
Ah, now that's the view!
so, is that a cultivated slope? - Yes, it is.
all of those... All those lines of bushes are coffee trees.
they are all equivalent to this, this is a coffee tree.
we headed down the bumpy mountain road to David's processing plant where the coffee beans are picked and sorted.
it took 45 minutes to travel barely half a mile.
in the rainy season, this road is almost impassable.
it all seems part of a very, very difficult commute, as it were.
it is a challenge, but to me it's wonderful, it's...
these bits of driving are some of the most enjoyable parts of what I do.
20 years ago, Hurricane Gilbert destroyed so many plantations that the entire industry was shut down for two years.
and there have been nine other hurricanes in the last decade.
looking across here, you can see bare bits of hillside where the hurricane has just literally ripped trees out of the ground.
it's just taken it all away. - Yes, it has.
that is just symptomatic as to what has happened throughout mine and other farms.
small areas, just small tornado-like parts of the hurricane, just decimating.
but that can be quite catastrophic to a crop.
well, it has. Not just the crop, but you're then losing the trees which take four or five years before they can come back and bear.
and financially it's...destroying, er...
you're removing not just that crop, but your years to come.
you have to be very philosophical to endure this.
you need broad shoulders and, hopefully, deep pockets.
coffee has been grown and hand-picked in Jamaica for nearly 300 years.
it's a time-consuming business.
it takes 25 people eight months to pick one season's produce.
these are what are ready now. - Are these ready for picking?
the one in your hand, no. - No.
but this one here is? -Yes.
look, right, you see, it has to be all red.
deep red.
Percy McCarty is David's plantation manager.
to get the stems off. Don't get the stems off.
you leave the stems on the tree to help to form the next crop.
these look very ripe. - They are.
those can go. You can pick those.
go. Right. - Yes. OK.
that's right. - There you go.
these are ripe ones?
this is what you shouldn't... - Oh, you shouldn't do. Ah. I erred.
there's an art in turning it to leave that on the tree.
Yeah, OK.
and then you pick all this and it's put in a bag of some sort?
Yes. - And then taken to the next stage?
to the pulpery where we... - Which is what?
there is a little machine we have, which extracts this red pulpy skin.
there is your coffee beans in there.
some of the leaves have gone bad, is this a fungus?
Yes, it is. Here is one of them with the actual spores on them.
see those spots? - Yes.
you try to get rid of those by using fungicide.
the more I hear about this, the more I think this is a very, very difficult process.
would you like to become a coffee farmer?
not from what I've heard today, but I'd like to think that people continue doing it so we can keep enjoying the coffee.
I've been doing it for 30 years, so I will continue.
once picked, the beans go through 1 4 processes, about twice as many as a regular high-street bean.
then they arrive here, where David's mother, Dorothy, is in charge of roasting them.
here they come. - Would you like to lift that for me?
this way? - Yes.
Ah, my goodness me. I've done something useful today.
they do look like beautiful coffee beans.
not that I would know the difference between ones which are unpretty, but they're wonderful.
these days very little of this coffee reaches our shores.
85 percent of it is sold to the Japanese, who are still happy to pay $50 a pound.
in your sort of world, is coffee drunk best if it's black coffee?
do you hate to see milk put in it, as people hate to see people put soda in Scotch?
I don't hate it, but it is definitely... - Not advisable.
this is the way to drink coffee. - OK.
and this is certainly the way to drink good coffee.
well, you'd like to know that I only drink black coffee.
well, I'm very glad. - Thank you very much.
as I enjoyed the fruits of David's labour, it was impossible not to admire his resolve.
if Jamaica is to throw off its image as the drugs capital of the Caribbean, crops like coffee could be its salvation.
in Jamaica I'd seen how the promise of easy money can lead straight to a prison cell.
but I was about to discover how, with enough money, it's possible to become a law unto yourself.
the island I'd come to next attracts more British tourists than any other in the Caribbean.
a quarter of a million British holiday-makers come every year to Barbados.
at the eastern edge of the Caribbean, this former British colony is only 21 miles long and 14 miles wide, but it's big on luxury.
Barbados sells its own version of the Caribbean dream...at a price.
sandy Lane is perhaps the most famous hotel in the Caribbean.
if you're prepared to pay up to $25, 000 a night, then this is the place for you.
everyone from Elton john to the Queen has stayed here.
sandy Lane may be the destination of choice for holidaying celebrities, but the most famous person on the island is someone few tourists have ever heard of.
I was on my way to meet the man who is said to own much of Barbados.
I'd come to see Sir Charles Williams, one of the biggest property developers on the island.
morning. - Trevor McDonald. Nice to see you.
nice to see you. Pleasure.
welcome to our home, and Barbados. - Thank you.
it's a pleasure. - Thank you. This is a lovely house.
well, it's a little on the old side. It's like the owner.
how old is it? It's an old plantation house, isn't it?
I'll show you exactly.
in those days, the mortar was molasses and lime.
OK. - And that was found... 1664.
so, the house dates to 1664? - 1664.
so it's a 17th-century house. - Yes.
four percent of the population of Barbados are white.
most are descendants of slave owners, but Sir Charles, the son of a farmer, has built his empire from scratch.
I started life working for $110 a month...and nobody has ever given me anything, or have I ever borrowed money that I haven't paid back.
and Mummy gave me an everlasting bit of advice.
son, save your money and buy land.
buy land. - Buy land.
I've never stopped. If I have a regret, I didn't buy enough land.
sir Charles lives with his second wife, Marie Ann and their pet pig, Hogey, who he assures me is fully house-trained.
come on, Hog, come and say hello.
Hey, Hoggy. - Come and say hello.
looking for the easiest point out.
come here, Hoggarts. - That's better.
actually coming to say hello.
you are such a... come here, Hoggarts, come.
you want a scratch, Hoggarts? - What wonderful eyes.
sir Charles may be eccentric, but he's also very driven.
polo was introduced to the island by the British in the 19th century.
today, Sir Charles is probably its biggest fan and promoter.
rather surprisingly, the polo field is one of the few bits of the island Sir Charles doesn't own.
but he does own every single one of the horses.
what a bowl! God almighty!
Oh, Philip, man. That's against the rules!
he was pushing him off.
is he a good loser? - No, appalling loser.
he hates losing. - Yes.
he says, "A good loser is always a loser.
turn, Richard. Turn, Richard.
go, Philip! Go, Philip!
and he misses it!
shoot him!
you're not a very good loser, are you? - No, I'm the worst loser in the world.
it's difficult to find a bit of real estate in Barbados that isn't his.
sir Charles' latest credit-crunch-defying project is a 400 million golf course...complete with luxury villas.
but his most prized development is the Port St Charles marina, named after himself, of course.
this is home to the high rollers.
Roman Abramovich, no less, moors one of his yachts here.
it's hard to imagine now, but this landscape was once very different.
where we are sailing now was solid rock, we had to excavate this from solid rock.
it was considered madness, but with a vision...
so, all this is... - All this is Port St Charles.
this is a huge development!
the marina took ten years to complete, carved out of thousands of tonnes of coral rock.
this is an empire built on creating something out of nothing.
sir Charles' critics say with some apartments here selling for over four million dollars, the only possible buyers are the super rich.
and his voracious land buying has caused concern at the highest levels.
the prime minister of the day made the message very clear, "Don't pull yourself up there any more.
he virtually kind of said, in not so many words, "Charles, I think you have enough.
Yes, he said it was having an impact on the social structure, or whatever you like to call it.
and I obeyed him, like a good, obedient boy.
look at these yachts. Look at them. They are magnificent!
I get the feeling this is the height of luxury.
not only to have your own very expensive waterside apartment, but also to have your yacht as well.
I mean, I've heard people have one or the other.
well, there was more ambitions, there was three ambitions I had, pretty wife, a nice sports fisherman, and a fast sports car.
I had all, and all three cost me a fortune.
Yeah, but you still have survived, you seem to have done pretty well.
this is what I used to enjoy on a regular basis, sports fishing.
one thing's for sure, Sir Trevor, I bought it with the name. I did not name it.
let's see the name... "Never Enough."
very aptly named. It is never enough.
in what respect? Is it the work is never enough?
the land is never enough? The developments are never enough?
I think he always feels he can do more.
always feels there's going to be more.
but he gives everything his all, and the boat is definitely appropriately named.
how has that impacted on your relationship?
do you find you get enough time?
Yes, it's very exciting, because there's always something new going on and there's always something exciting about to happen.
and, erm, no, it's definitely... it's a good ride.
sir Charles is not shy about selling his achievements of having risen from owning a single bulldozer to actually changing the landscape of an entire island.
living proof perhaps that if you have the money, anything is possible in the Caribbean.
next week, living with the forces of nature in the Caribbean.
sir George, how nice to see you.
I meet Sir George Martin on the once beautiful island of Montserrat virtually swallowed up by a massive volcanic eruption.
onto Grenada for rare sighting of giant turtle.
when you're up close like this, it looks almost like a prehistoric ritual.
and I visit the extraordinary Harbor Island.
you get on very well with Naomi Campbell?
Yes. The press have got her blown out of proportion.
Fee-fi-fo-fum.
ask not whence the thunder comes.
ask not where the herds have gone.
nor why the birds have ceased their song.
when coming home, don't take too long.
for monsters roam in Albion.
Jack, you're still up.
sorry, Father.
the giants woke me.
Jack, heh, it's a thunderstorm. - Mother used to say the giants made the thunder.
look.
where did you find that?
along with her old things.
will you read the rest to me?
all right.
Where're we up to?
the monks were trying to find God, so they made magic...
magic seeds. Aye.
I remember now.
with seeds they pulled from a magical pod the monks grew a pathway to seek out their God.
when they came to what they thought was heaven's gate...
they met with a terrible, grisly fate.
for between heaven and earth was a...
perilous place.
Gantua, home to a fierce giant race.
with a bridge now before them to the world of men, a plague of giants descends.
taking a cue from the richest of kings, they acquired a taste for acquiring things.
but the one taste that caused them to lose all control was a taste for the mankind blood, bones and all.
well, that's revolting.
too scary, Isabelle?
giants aren't scary.
not even their terrifying leader, a monstrous giant with two heads?
keep reading, Mother. It's just a story.
is it?
king Erik...
bade the monks return to dark arts...
to find some way...
to rule giant hearts.
so they melted one down...
mixed in magic and more...
and they crafted a crown unlike any before.
king Erik's magic crown.
this is my favorite part.
as soon as the king took the crown in hand...
the giants were slave...
to his every command.
he sent them back to the place of their birth.
their home now a prison between heaven and earth.
Erik severed the link between giants and men.
and peace returned to his kingdom again.
the mystical relics were all that remained safe with Erik through the years that he reigned.
and when time came at last for King Erik to sleep...
he took crown and seed with him for permanent keep.
and as the king's bones slowly crumbled away...
truth became legend.
or so people say.
what will happen when the giants come back?
they won't, son.
but what if they do? - Jack.
well, I guess the king's Guardians will have to cut them down to size.
I wanna be a Guardian.
you have the spirit. No doubt about that.
the king's Guardians must be born of noble blood.
there's not much in ours but dirt and sweat.
it's only a story, Jack.
giants aren't real.
but King Erik was real.
he was.
in some ways, he still is.
you're of his blood. - I've seen where he's buried.
in the royal catacombs? Sounds like you've been having some adventures of your own.
am I in trouble? - Not at all.
I want you to have adventures.
it'll make you a better queen. - How?
because you'll get to see how the world works.
and when you're queen, you'll have the power to make the world a better place.
now off to sleep.
sweet dreams...
Isabelle.
leave that one.
all right.
now get some sleep, son.
we have to be out on the field before first light.
father.
how do you know giants aren't real?
I don't.
and jealous eyes are looking down on peaceful fields in Albion.
an enemy vows will come a day when giants return and giants stay.
to wage a war...
and this time win...
and to eat the last of Erik's kin.
Jack...
when you're back from selling the horse...
get working on the weeds out back.
they're about to swallow the house.
I'll get to it, Uncle.
and, Jack? - Yes, Uncle?
don't get distracted.
come on, don't look at me like that.
I wouldn't sell you, but we haven't got much choice.
horse and cart for sale. Going for a price.
I'll be sad to see him go.
horse and cart?
Fee-fi-fo-fum.
ask not whence the thunder comes.
ask not where the herds have gone.
nor why the birds have ceased their song.
when coming home, don't take too long.
for monsters roam in Albion.
now let's turn that frown upside down.
here comes King Erik with his magic crown. - Hello, mates!
I'm Erik the Great.
Hello, Erik! - Would you like to hear how I defeated the giants? - Yeah!
in Gantua we set our scene where a stalk has grown from a magic bean.
and from there, beyond the reach of men...
a plague of giants did descend.
and what do we have over here?
Hello, pretty. And what might your name be?
none of your business.
very pretty.
where did you get that? - Nice.
from my mother.
now, please, let me be.
come on, go after her.
where do you think you're going?
what's the matter? Not enjoying the show? - Hands off.
Hey, that's no way to treat a, unh!
lady.
to be honest, you looked too drunk to do that.
what say we let the good lady go home...
and I'll consider forgetting this.
we're sorry, sir. We don't want any trouble.
good. Because that's what you're gonna get. Trouble.
Yeah. All three of you.
a whole lot of trou...
there's something behind me, isn't there?
what's your name?
Jack.
something wrong with your knees, Jack?
forward.
Where's my cart?
has anyone seen my cart?
Roderick!
Roderick. - What?
the king wants to see you. - Why?
princess has wandered off again. - Pfft.
you gonna let her do that kind of thing once you two is married?
when we're married, as far as I'm concerned, she can wander off a cliff.
I have bigger plans.
Roderick...
why do you think them monks shave their heads like that?
is that so God can see into their brains?
that's what I like about you, Wicke:
stuffed to the gills with insatiable curiosity.
now, that's a pity.
Oh, thank God, it's still here.
close the gates to the city...
take some men and find that monk.
and by the authority of the Lord High Constable of Cloister...
this gate will remain closed until I find what I am looking for!
I am looking for a thief!
if you ain't stolen nothing, you ain't got nothing to worry about! You!
there! With the bald head!
turn around, let me see your face! - Enough! Bow!
him!
on your knees!
horse for sale. Last chance, going for a great price.
he's a good horse for a cart if you had one. - I'll give you 10 coppers.
ten? Really?
I'm on an urgent mission. Life and death.
Yeah, all right, deal.
I don't have the money with me.
but there's money at the abbey.
I'm sure...
you're an honest man.
I'd much rather sell Anser to a man of the cloth than a butcher,
but I can't afford to go home empty-handed.
of course. Of course.
you idiot!
I wanna see their baldy heads!
which is why I'm offering you collateral.
beans.
not just beans.
they are holy relics, from a very special time long, long ago.
they look like beans to me.
they are priceless...
to the monks of Cloister.
worth more than 10 coppers.
whatever happens...
you must bring those beans back to the abbey.
take them to Prior Puffin and tell him that Brother Abel sent you.
you'll get your money.
brother Abel, these are just beans.
son, those beans have the power to change the world as we know it.
don't lose them.
and whatever you do...
don't get them wet.
stop that monk!
watch out!
you there! Stop!
grab him!
take him down!
block the exit! Grab him now!
stay where you are!
don't move!
Hello, monk.
I'm sorry, Elmont.
sorry for what, princess?
well, I don't mean to make your job so hard all the time...
it's just sometimes, I have to get out of here.
I don't ask for much in return for all those years I put food in your belly， clothes on your back, a roof over your head.
so, what do I have to show for it?
beans.
I'll take them to the abbey tomorrow and tell the monks what happened.
you believe that story?
I mean, he was a monk.
because he wore a robe? Funny haircut? - Yeah.
no.
monks have no money.
they're monks!
the man robbed you!
Jack, you have got to grow up.
you're 18 years old.
and I'm not...
going to be around forever.
Majesty.
Oh, apparently, I'm not supposed to move.
seems like cheating.
can't keep running off like this.
what if something were to happen?
you're the future queen of Cloister.
according to you, having a king is all that matters.
I've never said any such thing.
so why force me to marry someone twice my age whom I do not love?
I'm sorry, Roderick.
so that's what this is about?
Majesty! Please be still.
it's about your refusal to see...
that I'm not some fragile, helpless creature.
you are so like your mother.
just like your father.
head in the clouds. Useless!
look, I can fix this. I promise.
too late for that.
nothing left to fix.
never thought it'd come to this.
your parents' things.
should fetch a few weeks' worth at the market.
take my legs half the night to get there with no horse.
you can't sell those.
they aren't yours to sell. - Horse was. Cart too.
Jack, it was a simple task.
sell the horse, buy some thatch, fix the roof.
you've got to take responsibility.
then let me.
let me show you how responsible I can be.
let me get to know the people that I am meant to lead.
let me step outside without sending a dozen guards to rescue me.
your Majesty!
the day I lost your mother was the darkest day of my life.
I do not intend to lose you too.
darkest day of my life the day I lost your father to the plague.
made worse by the plague he left me.
yet if I were a prince...
you'd allow me to find my own way. Mother said...
I should marry for love, but in my own time.
please, Father...
let me show you that I am capable.
you belong in the safety of the palace.
you will marry Roderick.
there's nothing further to discuss.
so sayeth the king.
Isabelle!
well? Did you get anything out of him?
no. He wouldn't spill the beans.
I'm going to ask you just once:
where are they?
you should have left them where they were buried.
they are born of dark magic.
and once darkness gets a taste for light...
it will not stop...
until it has swallowed the sun.
you cannot hope to control it.
we will never let you succeed.
we owe it to God.
you owe it to God?
well...
give him my regards.
come on. You're not that stubborn, old man.
easy, boy. Easy, boy.
what?
fine. I'll go after him.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I saw...
your light and I'm lost.
well, come in, please.
I'm Jack.
how do you do, Jack?
what are you doing out in this nasty weather?
well, it wasn't like this when I set out. The storm...
just crept up on me. - What, and you just saw my light?
Yes.
you were riding alone?
at the moment.
do you do that often?
is this your farm?
Yes.
no. Sort of.
my uncle and I are tenant farmers. We just work the land.
and, uh, these books?
Yeah, they're mine.
it's unusual for a farm boy. - Judging by the cover...
are we?
what do you like reading?
I like a good adventure.
in books or in life?
till I can find a way to get off this farm,
I have to settle for books.
and, uh, that mark on your face...
was that an adventure?
I, um, got in a fight today. At the market.
what about?
I was defending the honor of the princess.
princess? Really?
you sure you didn't read that in one of your books?
how did you know it was the princess? - I didn't.
just saw she needed help.
it wasn't until the Guardians showed up...
that I realized who she was.
anyway, it happened very fast.
I wouldn't blame her if she didn't remember me.
what are you running away from?
who says I'm running away?
maybe I'm running toward something.
just looking for an adventure of my own.
well, so far you've run toward the light on my porch...
your Highness.
please stand.
you must think I'm very silly. - No.
I just wish that...
well, earlier...
at the market- Thank you...
for defending my honor, Jack.
anytime.
here, I'll take your coat.
and...
until you find your own adventure...
the Giants of Gantua.
my father used to read that to me.
that was always my mother's job.
I hope you find what you're looking for, Your Highness.
call me Isabelle.
Isabelle.
Isabelle!
Jack!
No!
help! Hurry!
get me out!
Jack! Please!
No!
Unh! - Jack! You came back!
no, no, no! No!
what is it? What's wrong?
heights. I'm not wildly keen on heights.
hold on, I'm coming!
it's stuck!
Unh! - Aah!
hold on!
No!
Jack!
what were you doing with my daughter's bracelet?
hmm?
down! - Hmm?
no, I didn't steal it.
I promise. She showed up at my house looking for shelter.
I was trying to help her, Your Majesty, and then...
and then?
all this happened.
wait a minute, I recognize you from the market.
your name is, uh, Jack.
let him up. - Beans.
and where is your house, Jack?
Elmont...
assemble a team. Men who can climb.
Yes, sire.
I'd like to accompany them.
with due respect...
this mission is likely to be arduous.
best left to the professionals.
I would like the chance to prove my worth to my beloved.
and to you.
very well. Just bring her back. - Jack!
no further!
Jack! What have you done?
who is this man?
he's my uncle.
your Majesty...
I want to volunteer.
Jack! - Your Majesty, please.
why don't we bring wives and lady friends?
let's not...
let's not be hasty.
I think the young man should come.
he's the only one who saw what happened.
he might shed light on this mystery.
your Majesty. - No, Elmont, Roderick's right.
he might be an asset.
now go. And may God help you bring back my daughter.
hold to a line soldiers!
please, sir, the other side of the tree.
that means move back.
please, sir.
move back.
what do you suppose...
is up there?
I'm not a superstitious man, Jack.
I never suppose.
I simply prepare for everything.
what, like giants? - No, everything real.
fear of falling.
fear of falling.
well, then don't fall.
Oh, that's great advice...
Yeah.
all right, let's get moving, chaps.
I hope you're not putting yourself through all this with the aim of impressing the princess.
what? No.
good.
you'd be barking up the wrong beanstalk.
even if she could...
avoid marrying Roderick, law dictates that...
she will never marry a commoner.
Tallyho.
your turn.
come on, Jack, it's not very far.
come on.
you want to know a little trick?
no. - When I'm afraid...
I imagine a big piece of cake...
floating right in front of me.
brilliant. Thanks.
like a reward waiting for you, just within arm's reach.
right.
can you see it?
not really.
then go get it!
Crawe.
am I dead?
not just yet.
help us! Pull us up! - Bloody hell!
help!
Wicke! Wicke!
I think it's time...
to lighten the load!
help!
Wicke...
what are you doing?
No! Please!
what's happening down there?
No! Please!
sorry, boys!
Roderick, what's going on?
the line!
it snapped!
they're gone! They're all gone!
Isabelle.
well, look at that.
well, she's not in the house.
this is the only other place she could've gone.
and if she climbed down...
we would've seen her.
she didn't climb down. She climbed up.
why would she do that? - If she were cold.
or hungry.
or looking for an adventure.
Crawe.
bald.
thank you, sir.
is this all you have?
the rations went down with my men.
Ah. - Where are the beans?
Shh.
my lord?
there are exactly three men in Cloister who can make a person disappear.
the Lord High Constable, the Lord High Steward...
and the Chief Advisor to the King.
unfortunately for you...
I'm all three.
come on.
come on!
come on!
and not a word. Or you and your uncle...
poof!
Crawe? It's her, yes?
course it's her. She's a smart girl.
Isabelle? - So she can find her way back.
keep up, or you'll be left behind!
all together now!
pull!
and heave! - Pull!
maybe he slipped.
Yes.
maybe they all slipped.
there's another mark. Half finished.
something happened here.
Isabelle!
Isabelle!
Isabelle!
Isabelle!
Isabelle!
Isabelle! - Isabelle!
I'm getting an awfully bad feeling about this, Crawe.
she's a resourceful girl.
we'll find her.
she hid in here.
I think something grabbed her.
why would you think that?
this is the book I gave her.
and look at those broken branches.
Crawe.
something big pulled her out of there.
she's in trouble. - Bald...
go with Wicke and Roderick.
take the high ground. We'll continue on this way.
don't engage in anything unless you have to.
our mission is to find...
and return the princess.
and we must assume that this is now hostile territory.
and that every story your fathers told you was true.
good luck.
anyone hungry?
Elmont! - Hold on!
Elmont!
me knife! I can't get me knife.
get the knife.
come on, man, cut it.
go on, lad.
come on.
Elmont, come on.
just cut us out! - Okay!
you wanna do it?
almost there.
just a bit more.
Crawe.
what was that?
help me get down. - Jack.
get out. Get out, lad.
get out now!
we'll have to go around.
your Lordship, stay here and get some rest.
I'll scout out the ridge and find the safest way across.
most considerate. Thank you.
Oh, look. There's Isabelle.
do you see her?
right there.
where?
we see you, my darling!
we're coming, my love! Right there! - Where?
is she okay?
Roderick? - Yes?
why is it, right, people always scream before they die?
do they think it's gonna help or some...? Aah!
put me down! Roderick!
do you believe in God?
well, do you?
of course.
would you like to meet him?
not yet, no.
then you will answer our questions.
how did you get here?
I won't answer.
I understand...
what telling you would mean.
and not telling us.
where are the others?
I came alone.
you think we are fools?
where you go, many more will follow.
you are a descendent of Erik the Terrible, are you not?
are you not?
Erik the Great?
that was so long ago.
have we...
faded into legend?
we have...
forgotten the look of his face.
we have forgotten...
the sound of his voice.
but we never forget...
a smell.
your blood betrays you, Your Highness.
your Highness.
my brothers...
at long, long last, the mankind have returned.
they're uglier than I remember.
and among them...
comes the blood of our jailer...
Erik the Terrible!
Erik.
hello there. - Oh, my God.
and today...
we will taste...
the sweet nectar of revenge!
revenge!
general.
fee, well done.
put us down! - Patience.
Elmont. Crawe!
your Majesty!
princess!
a delightful reunion.
I'm afraid we haven't met.
how many are you?
piss off, giant!
Crawe, quiet.
how did you...
get here?
where is the way down?
choke on my bones.
Crawe!
No! No!
out of the way! I want some!
Finn!
what is it? - Time to eat!
make way!
what have you heard? - I heard there was three of them.
three? How did they get up here? - I don't know.
perhaps they've learned to fly in the air like birds.
Nah, they're probably too stupid for that. Ha-ha-ha.
that's true.
come on.
let's see what all the fuss is.
so tell us how you...
got here...
or we eat her.
no, general.
I found her.
the right to eat her is mine alone.
we know the rules of the hunt, Fumm.
but she is different!
the general abuses his power.
you're not our king.
No!
I believe that distinction...
now belongs to me.
foe? Fye?
we had no choice, General Fallon.
he has the...
the crown.
Yes, the crown.
cut from the same rock as your hard hearts.
they are inextricably linked.
to deny the crown...
is to deny your very existence.
so on your knees.
lower.
lower.
Roderick!
on your feet, general.
prisoners of Gantua! - Well done, Roderick.
have them release us at once. - Ah-ah-ah.
I'm talking to giants at the moment.
by the way, darling...
wedding's off.
what?
so prisoners of Gantua...
I bring you the gift of freedom!
tonight we feast...
but tomorrow you shall return below with me as your new king.
first...
we'll take the kingdom of Cloister...
and then her neighbors.
and in time, we will...
test this Viking myth of a greater land across the sea.
are you mad?
Yes. It seems that power's gone directly to my head.
you traitorous bastard!
Yeah.
as I was saying...
gather your armor...
sharpen your swords...
and prepare for battle everyone! We attack at dawn!
Hail! Hail! Hail!
Hail!
stop! Please...
let us go! - Quiet, you.
don't worry, princess. Everything will be all right.
Jack.
let's see where I put that.
you're here.
you sound surprised.
Yeah, well, we're miles up and you're afraid of heights.
I'm not afraid. Just not wildly keen.
Fee-fi-fo and fum
get Elmont.
I like mankind.
served well-done.
Fallon likes them raw and red.
freshly snatched and not quite dead.
don't worry. I'll get you out.
I had this, Jack.
I took my eye off the ball...
but I had this.
careful.
watch out.
take this. - Got it.
tasty treats.
them's good eats
Elmont!
Hello, little one. - No!
put me down! - They brought me a duchess once.
quite a fat thing.
but you: all skin and bones.
they tell me you're a princess.
let's hope they haven't spoiled you rotten.
what's that?
kill him, Jack!
well done, Jack.
well done.
here.
Thanks.
come on.
I know the way out of here.
Where's Crawe?
a winner!
general Entin.
you called for me, sire?
you think we should cut it down.
such words have never passed my lips, sire.
I'm not asking what you said. I'm asking...
what you believe.
I believe what I see, sire.
and when you look at the stalk, what do you see?
I see a way up and a way down.
and I pray, as do all my men, that your daughter finds her way down.
and if something else finds its way down first?
well, that would mark a time when no man from noble birth to lowest would wish he were king.
sorry, general.
it looks like mankind is off the menu this evening.
you.
me?
no, not you.
huh?
I have a job for you.
it's a hell of a view, my old friend.
that should stop the bleeding. - What is it?
yarrow. It's just a weed that grows everywhere, but it can be useful.
you know a lot about the land.
ought to. Been working it all my life.
whereas I have merely owned it.
if I hadn't have run away, none of this would have happened.
a princess is such a useless thing.
if you hadn't run away,
Roderick would have taken over the kingdom with no warning.
your running away just might have given Cloister a fighting chance.
so no one's useless, least of all the princess.
that's why we need to get you back, because one day you'll be the queen...
and from then on you'll have the power to make the world better.
Isabelle...
imagine all the good things you could do.
that's what my mother used to say.
the bleeding's stopped. - Good.
so which way now, Jack?
follow the water. That'll lead us to the edge.
Roderick's handiwork, no doubt.
he must've sent him...
to block the entrance.
I've got an idea.
what?
we're gonna wake a sleeping giant.
well, that doesn't sound like a good idea.
this is a terrible idea.
have you ever killed a giant before?
and you've killed, what, one? Which makes you an expert now?
weren't you in an oven an hour ago?
all right, then.
the moment he clears that hole we make a run for it.
what the...?
bees!
why do these things always happen to me?
Whoa!
you did it, Jack.
you did it.
uh, right.
let's go.
princess, Jack.
go. I'll be down as soon as I can.
what? No, Elmont, we go together.
I'm not going anywhere without that crown.
that's not the mission.
find the princess and bring her home.
you complete the mission, get her to her father, leave Roderick to me.
but- Did you ever kill a man?
go.
thank you.
here.
thank you for saving...
my life.
you're one of us now, Jack.
I'm honored.
just come back to us...
okay? - I will.
go. Go.
Isabelle. Come on.
forward!
that looks nice.
general Entin.
sire.
cut it down.
but...
the legends are true.
for the sake of the kingdom...
cut it down.
did you hear me?
forgive me, Isabelle.
you heard your king.
we cut it down!
you know, for someone who's not wildly keen on heights...
you're doing awfully well.
I've been doing a trick. Crawe taught me.
what's the trick?
picture something just ahead of you within arm's reach.
something that makes you happy.
sounds easy enough.
it really is.
cloister.
I never thought I'd miss it.
Isabelle...
before you go back to your world and I'm back in mine...
whatever happens from here,
I just want you to know that I think...
look at all those lights.
what are they doing?
they're waiting to welcome us home.
we need two more.
I said get the carts moving! - Yes, sir!
pass it up! Come on, quicker!
I got it!
steady, now! Lift them up!
don't let those blazes go out!
get some water up here!
brothers, all together!
halt.
you there, Fye, Foe, set me down here.
Highness. - Your Majesty.
down we go.
help me!
dig them out.
come on, brothers.
come on, lads.
Unh! - Harder. Come on!
you thought that you were the hero of this story.
don't you know...
that we all think that?
I may not be the hero of this story...
but at least I get to see how it ends.
help me!
help me!
help me!
help me!
No!
all hail King Fallon!
Hail!
I need more men!
now!
get up, boy!
come on!
stand clear! Stand clear!
Oh, no.
hang on.
sire, quickly!
No!
Isabelle...
hold on tight.
ready? - Uh-uh.
jump!
Jack! Hold me.
well, that worked out better than I expected.
take cover!
your Majesty.
father!
Isabelle!
Oh, thank God! Ah.
I thought I'd lost you forever.
and the rest of the Guardians?
only Elmont survived.
but he stayed behind to confront Roderick.
Why?
Roderick betrayed you, Father.
he had the crown, the one from the legend.
he meant to use the giants to take Cloister.
Roderick?
I trusted him with my kingdom.
and worse, I would have trusted him with you.
Isabelle, I am so sorry.
it doesn't matter now.
it's a long ride back to the castle.
come, let us get you in your armor.
Where's Jack?
who's Jack?
the one I came down with.
the one who rescued me.
the farm boy?
Jack?
a word.
I sent my best Guardians up that stalk.
all heroes, sire. - Yes.
but you brought Isabelle back.
as a king, I can reward you with many things.
as a father...
I can never reward you enough.
that's very generous, Your Majesty.
it's more than I could ever ask for.
matching armor. Nice.
you look beautiful.
thank you.
they're waiting for you.
but...
to remember me by.
I won't need any help remembering.
goodbye, Your Highness.
Jack, I told you...
call me- Isabelle.
time to go.
not now.
what?
what?
bean!
are you ready, my brothers?
can you taste it?
here comes the thunder.
fee!
Fye!
foe!
Fumm!
onward and downward!
feast on the mankind!
sweet blood!
make way! Make way for the others!
to Albion!
remember, Fumm:
the princess is mine. - Mine!
so sayeth the king.
anser. It's good to see you, boy.
you've come a long way.
have I got a story to tell you.
what's the matter?
nothing, Father.
it's good to be back.
they're coming!
giants!
the monks haven't rung that bell in...
I don't think I've ever heard them ring it.
run!
run!
giants!
giants!
Isabelle!
Jack?
Jack!
what's he yelling?
giants!
giants!
Isabelle, run!
kill the mankind! - Rip their heads off!
you can't...
run from me!
father!
make way!
don't let them get to the castle!
the king approaches!
close the drawbridge!
it stays open till I give the command!
sir. - Form into ranks!
up to the battlements, now!
ready the archers!
release the oil!
steady, men!
ready!
wait for it!
wait for it.
light it up!
raise...
the drawbridge! - Elmont, no!
bring it up!
together!
keep running, boy!
come on, Jack!
wait!
come on, Anser!
Jack!
move in! - Draw!
fire!
Fumm!
what now?
get the hooks.
quickly, men!
get that bridge up and secure it!
that won't hold them for long.
Jack!
Isabelle. - Archers to the parapets!
princess! - Elmont, you made it!
Jack. That was a close one. - Yeah.
Elmont! - Your Majesty.
Roderick?
Roderick is dead, Your Majesty. - And the crown?
I'm afraid the giants have the crown.
form up, fast!
keep going! Keep going!
pull!
archers to the north wall!
Isabelle, in my chambers, there's a passage...
that leads to the top of Cloister Tower.
you'll find a beacon there. Light it.
warn the other kingdoms.
you can count on us, Father.
Jack?
look after her.
this way! This way!
men, support the drawbridge! - Men, to the gate!
come on, men! Pull!
we've got to pull it down!
looks like we got ourselves a fight!
I need help on these lines!
forward, to the gate!
stop here, Jack.
this way, come on.
what's this? - A shortcut.
get those scorpies to the battlements! Go!
sire!
go!
move!
to the ramparts!
where are we?
ancient burial ground for the royal family.
these aqueducts run everywhere underneath Cloister.
I used to play hide-and-seek here.
you have a lot of ancestors. - Yes, I know.
grave robbers?
apparently, I'm not the only one who knows about this place.
get those braces in here!
bring it up!
what's the matter, brothers? Aren't you hungry?
come on, men!
we're losing her!
let's go! Move it! Move it!
come on, don't you want to eat? Pull!
fall into formation on the south door!
be ready to load in position!
load them up! Aim high!
and fire!
get the scorpions out of here!
men to the ropes! Pull!
pull!
heave!
heave!
and pull!
so, what did you find out up there?
do these giants have any weaknesses?
move it!
not many, no!
it's just like my place.
Jack, come on.
are you expecting someone?
run!
hold fast!
hold fast to the rope!
that's it!
more trees!
do this together!
burn them all!
take their place!
stay on the ropes!
victory, I can almost taste it.
I got this.
take cover!
your scent is faint, princess.
mixed with smoke clouded by char.
but we can always smell fear.
how mankind likes to immortalize itself.
thinks it can live forever!
run!
Isabelle, hurry!
she's mine, boy!
Jack...
Hurry!
No!
it's the end of the line...
princess.
put me down!
Jack!
No!
who are you?
gack.
it's Jack...
you freak!
try not to kick going down, boy.
No!
Jack!
that's it. They're through.
all right, brothers, this is done.
all at once!
now!
close the portcullis!
guardians!
get the king to safety!
like hell!
fall back, defensive positions!
defensive positions!
form up!
stand strong, men!
you smell that, brothers?
don't you love it when their blood curdles?
Yeah.
let's cut a few of them down to size, shall we?
How...?
there's something behind me, isn't there?
and so returned the giant hordes.
the stalks cut down with giant swords.
the king struck down the law that read:
a princess must a noble wed.
then, such a wedding not seen since...
...of a princess and her farm boy prince.
you skipped a part. What happened in between?
in between?
well, um, you know, they courted for a bit...
no, not that.
what happened to the crown?
you never tell us what happened to the crown. - The crown?
Yeah. What if the giants come back?
don't worry. It's in a very safe place.
can you tell the story about the giants again?
again?
all right, but this is the last time tonight.
Fee-fi-fo-fum.
ask not whence the thunder comes.
ask not where the herds have gone.
nor why the birds have ceased their song.
when coming home, don't take too long...
for monsters roam in Albion.
ask not whence the thunder comes.
ask not where the herds have gone.
nor why the birds have ceased their song.
I smell the blood of an Englishman.
be he living, or be he dead...
I'll grind his bones to make my bread.
and there was a princess and a golden harp.
and a horse named Anser.
and he took the family horse to the market.
or was it a cow? - A cow.
right, a cow.
at the market, he met an old man who convinced him to trade the cow for some...
magic beans.
he traded a cow for beans?
magic beans.
and how would he know that?
well, Jack wasn't very bright.
then his uncle threw one of the beans out of the window.
no, it was his mother. And it was three beans.
fine. His mother threw three beans out of the window...
and three giant stalks grew high up into the clouds.
for monsters roam in Albion.
now, after the crown jewels were stolen from Westminster Abbey...
in the early part of the 14th century, the English government recovered them...
and brought them here to the Tower of London for permanent safekeeping.
okay, make way, make way.
we're going to go across now to Tower Green.
now, what's Tower Green famous for?
well, Tower Green is famous for...
come on, Roddy! Stay with the group! Let's go!
tower Green is where Anne Boleyn was beheaded.
holy shit!
Oh, fuck!
no, no, no!
Oh, shit!
Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville. Welcome to Jackass!
all right, boys and girls. It's time for a puppet show.
once upon a time, there was a hungry serpent and a lonely field mouse who needed a friend.
Hello, Mr. Serpent.
my name is Mr. Mousey. I wanna be your friend.
Yeah, just make sure my whole weiner's out. I wanna look good.
how about if I tickle him on the tail? Hey, over here.
that's not nice.
that's not the way we play back home.
that was not nice.
dude.
he's like an inch away.
here we go. Give me a little kissy.
a little kiss.
Oh, God!
Oh, God, that hurts!
it's got its tooth stuck in his dick!
I guess the puppet show's over then.
Oh, my God.
Hi, Jackass guys.
I heard you were staying at this hotel.
what the fuck is that? - Dude, look at that.
it's like... Someone like...
look at it. What is this? I can't even read it, dude.
read it out loud.
Hi, Jackass guys. I heard you were staying at this hotel.
my name is Stephanie and me and my friends love you.
some of you actually hooked up with my sister four years ago.
I don't care about that.
Oh! You fucking dick.
Oh, my God.
I was wondering why it was so fucking small.
did you see this?
fucking fans just wrote this, like, saying how much they want to fuck us.
and it says... Read it up close. It's fucking hilarious.
read it out loud for the camera. - Okay.
some of you actually hooked up with my sister four years ago.
it was probably you.
and I don't care about that.
me and my friends will totally rock your world.
I wanna fuck you all.
it's the fucking stupidest thing I've ever seen.
fans actually put that... Read the little part, dude.
get Wee Man's little ass up here but only if... No one be in the hall.
just, like, Bam. He's selling it so good. - Is there a chair out here?
wee Man, dude, some girl wants to rock your world.
dude, you got to read this. These fans put up this...
dude, stand on this.
read it out loud for the camera. It's perfect "behind the scenes," dude.
Hi, Jackass guys. I heard you were staying at this hotel.
my name is Stephanie and me and my friends love you.
some of you actually hooked up with my sister four years ago.
I don't care about that.
me and my friends...
Oh, my God, that was amazing.
he actually stood on the chair.
why would there ever be a chair in the hallway?
I'm Dave England, and this is the Firehose Rodeo.
fucking hell!
God damn it!
Oh, shit!
Bravo, homo. - Did you see how he slammed?
my ass hurts so fucking bad!
Hey, is it bleeding? - Yeah.
man, you are bleeding.
my ass is bleeding? - We have rectal bleeding.
another first for Jackass.
get back here, you little bastard! Get back here!
now it's time for a little Bicentennial BMXing.
all right. - Alley-oop.
hear ye, hear ye.
this is really going to suck.
why would anybody ride this shit?
it's like, what's the reasoning?
why wouldn't they just make two of the same-size wheel?
Oh, fuck.
you all right? - Yeah.
you didn't land it.
my head stopped my body from getting really hurt on that one.
Oh, fuck.
see, we have a weight going up and it's supposed to hit me in the nuts, but I'd prefer to have, like, a dildo instead of the weight and then, instead of the nuts, it'll be my ass. It'll go right in.
that's the way to do it.
could somebody make a dick run? Please?
today's debate. Is it wrong to be strong?
you be the judge.
now, Bam just took a golden dildo up his ass at high speed.
that's what happened.
my name is Gloria and I'm 90 years old.
and I'm a slut.
okay, I'm going to go get us a table now, okay?
Bye, Mama. Thank you. - Goodbye.
go ahead. I'm fine.
excuse me, sir. Could I use your cellular telephone?
what's the number?
I don't know what number. It's the driver.
Oh, yes. Could you dial it for me? - Yes, yes.
what is the number?
I don't know. What is his number? I don't know.
this happens every time I go to brunch.
is this okay for now? - Yes, thank you.
I'm Danger Ehren, here with Thor, and this is the Mini-Loop.
he can barely ride it.
fuck.
fuck!
all right, let Thor try it.
come on.
I hit my head pretty hard.
good thing I'm wearing that helmet. Safety first.
I love that confidence.
I'm not gay but I... I kind of want to fuck him.
come on, Danger, get on it. - How's the bike?
bike's good.
he's mocking the loop.
after this movie comes out, you're totally going to lose your virginity.
you almost pulled it off. - I don't think dudes count, Chris.
here we are at some random-ass ranch, and this is the Brand.
and it's gonna suck.
drop them. - Good luck.
Christ!
you have no hair on your ass. - It is pretty.
you ready? - No.
you better get ready quick. - That is a mini hard dick right there.
try not to move around. You don't want to have two of those things on you.
Oh, dear God. I wasn't bummed for you, till right now.
okay.
if I take it off, it's gonna go cold in a second.
I have to keep it on until we're ready to film.
fuck.
all right. You said 10 seconds, 20 seconds ago.
clean him off.
all right, you ready? - No.
don't move.
go, go, go! - Don't move.
press it hard, you idiot!
fuck! It's good.
no, it's not, dude. You got to hold it to it.
Oh, fuck! Dude, that hurts so fucking bad!
well, if you didn't jump out of the way, I would've had it done the first time.
you should've pressed, you asshole! - I did press! You went like that!
fuck! Oh, God damn, that hurt so bad.
turn around.
I'm not going to burn you again. I already got you three times.
three of them. - You gave me a hologram dick.
there's three solid dicks, there's one half-assed one right here and then you gave me a set of balls.
but a sweet set of balls. - Rad.
I'd rather rip my dick off and throw it in the river than to do that again.
God damn.
we're at Ape and Phil's house and I'm gonna present them the branded dick on my butt.
let me rephrase that. Dicks.
well, I gave him a present. - What present?
he loved it.
what? - It still hurts.
what? What am I looking at? - He gave me a dick farm on my ass.
Oh, my God! What is that? What is that?
I branded his ass. - It's supposed to be a dick but he did it six times, so now I have a dick farm on my ass.
is that permanent? - Yes! Look!
what is that, a tattoo? - It's a brand. A hot iron for cows.
bam, that is so infected!
that does not look good. Oh, my God, he's going to have that for life!
you're going to have that for life. - No shit.
if you have one on there, you should've made it bigger and more realistic.
that puny thing's embarrassing. - Ape, I got a muffed-up-ass butt.
I know, and you had the cutest butt ever and now you've ruined it.
no, Dick Farm Dunn ruined it. - Yeah, why'd you ruin it?
I tried to do it good. He jumped around. I was scared. I'm burning my own friend.
why would you burn him in the first place, Dunn?
because it was funny. - It's not funny.
get ready to be happy, ladies and gentlemen.
Johnny Knoxville is going to jump the entire lake.
he's amazing.
what happened? You were going about one mile per hour, then, all of a sudden, 60.
I thought you were gonna hang on.
there is no holding on to that motherfucker.
Oh, my God.
ladies and gentlemen, Mark Zupan is going to jump the entire lake.
mark, give our regards to the folks on the other side.
I thought they forgot to set it off and then it just took off.
I don't know what happened. - I don't either.
all I know is he almost made it. - He's a hero.
we're here in England with Mat Hoffman and he's about to jump the English Channel into Germany.
good luck, Mat.
that was fucking great.
what was so great about that? He didn't even go to Germany.
Oh, my God.
it's a lovely day for a swim in the Gulf of Mexico.
I'm Steve-O, and this is the Fish Hook.
Oh, man, that's gone through. I got you.
Oh, dude. - We got it? We're good?
that hurt to do that to you.
Yeah, it looks great.
Oh, my God. - All right, cast me out, God damn it.
now it's time for some man-fishing.
the hammerhead's right there. - Oh, my God.
thank God we brought Manny to make sure sharks would show up.
he's coming to get you, Steve-O. Act like a sick or wounded animal.
look at that fin right behind him.
dude, isn't this movie supposed to be a comedy?
I can't believe I'm fishing for sharks with Steve-O as my bait.
it's like a dream come true.
Oh, my God.
here comes a mako! - Oh, shit! Steve-O!
Oh, my God. He's right behind you, Steve-O.
I am the fuck out of here. - No, you're good, man.
stay in there.
the shark's coming right at you!
Oh, shit.
come on, stay out there, O! - You already got the fucking shot!
I want to hear Manny scream.
dude, I fucking kicked the thing in the fucking head!
get up here.
steve-o, do you know how lucky you are?
a mako almost bit your foot off.
I've been so lucky today.
fuck!
you are lucky.
fuck, that hurts. Damn it. Thank you so much, God.
you bastard.
this is champion card-thrower Jim Karol.
he's come to throw cards into Wee Man's ass.
what Wee Man doesn't realize is that he'll be sitting on the Electric Stool.
God, I hate picking on Wee Man.
wee Man, I'd say you're up. - Jump up on the stool.
all right, on three I'm gonna whip it at you.
you might feel it a little bit, all right?
on three. Ready? - Don't worry about it.
fuck! That fucking...
did it hit a nerve?
dude, it hit, like, right in there. - Oh, I'm sorry. I threw it too hard.
try one more. It didn't stick. He's going to get it to stick.
on three. One,
I don't fucking like that, dude. No, I don't fucking like that, dude.
that fucking hurts, dude.
tell the camera exactly what's happening.
all right, every time this dude throws a fucking card in my ass, it fucking jolts me, so I jump off.
I'm not going to fucking sit there.
let me do a pickup shot. - No.
the pickup shot is, you pinch the card in your butt.
just stick it in there so it's sticking out. - All right.
okay, go. - One, two, three.
it's still in there.
jump back up. - Do you want me to lift you on there?
wait... - Okay, fuckers!
no, there's a machine in here fucking doing it, you fucking fuckers.
Where's the fucking card-throwing machine?
Where's the fucking card-throwing machine, dude?
show him what it is. Show him what's funny.
Oh, the fucking chair's rigged!
Oh, my God.
there's a card-throwing machine in here, dude.
dude, Wee Man, I would never use a card-throwing machine on you.
that couldn't have gone any better.
I didn't know that Knoxville could do back flips.
it was, like, a front flip.
where do yaks come from? - That's from Siberia.
so that's why Eskimos don't have rodeos.
Yeah.
tell me about your original drawing for this.
see, when I come up with my ideas, I don't write them down.
I just draw a picture and fax it to Los Angeles.
I just drew a picture of a fat-ass and a little guy with a bungee cord connected.
Jason, how do you compare this kind of athleticism to what you guys do?
you guys are a hell of a lot more athletic than us and a lot crazier, too.
dude, look how nervous he is.
we're here in Miami Beach with Jason Taylor and this is the Bungee Jump.
are you ready, Preston? - Just go! Just go!
Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Oh, my God.
Preston. - That worked perfect.
did I yank you? - Oh, fuck, yeah.
okay, I went down, I'm upside-down, I see Preston coming.
once he was past me, he pulled me down more.
so, like, I slammed the water. - Oh, you were above the water?
Yeah, I felt the full pressure of the bungee.
that was intense. Really intense. Well, not really intense, but pretty intense.
what's your name again? - What? Irving.
Irving, yeah. - Irving Zisman.
Hey, can we get some fries, please?
some time today.
there you go. Take a sip.
that'll put lead in your pencil, kid.
you got a light?
shit.
Hey, little guy, is that a real cigarette?
piss off, man. - Is it?
he said, "Piss off!"
Jesus.
here, Gramps.
thank you.
don't hog it all, you little prick.
give me that.
this is LA. - What?
this is LA. - Yeah?
don't do what? - We don't drink out in public.
you don't drink out in public? - No.
well, maybe you should start, bub. - Yeah. Where are you guys from?
we're from your face. - Yeah?
mind your own business, asshole. - What?
I said, "Mind your own business" , asshole.
okay, you'd better be quiet, buddy. - What are you gonna do?
you wanna step outside? - We're already outside, numbnuts.
he asked me if I wanted to step outside.
you are from LA, ain't you, boy? - Do you want to go around the block?
Yeah, we'll go around the block.
we'll go around the block and see your mother.
this is bullshit. We're surrounded by cocksuckers.
all right, kid. It's time for Grandpa's massage.
you get massages with happy endings?
that's right.
say goodbye to the hippies. - Bye, hippies.
don't get beat up out here. - "Beat up out here"?
I don't have to worry about that in LA. Not with you skinny sons of bitches.
okay, Old Man River. Watch your mouth.
I hear a lot of talking.
you're letting that bulldog mouth overload that puppy-dog ass.
look at him. Look how tough he is.
you allow your nine-year-old son to drink?
it's my grandson. - I don't give a fuck.
wow, now you swear in front of him? What kind of role model are you?
what kind of role model are you?
get the fuck out of here and go back to Mississippi.
step over this line. Just step over that line.
Oh! You stepped over the line! - I didn't step over a line.
you stepped over the line.
that long hair don't cover that red neck, boy.
piss off!
let's go. - Go crawl back in your mama's ass!
what the fuck is that? What the hell is that?
we're sledding.
bam, what the hell are you doing? - We're sledding.
give me a ten! - What about my floor?
how's your belly feeling, dude? - I'm just a diarrhea machine.
is it like a baby? Is it kicking? - It's very similar to a baby.
is it kicking? - No, come on! No.
seriously, I'm not joking. Seriously.
are you gonna shit? Wouldn't you feel better?
we have a whole wardrobe van.
I don't want a new wardrobe. I just wanna not shit my pants.
so, the boys think they're arriving in a limo for a photo shoot, but little do they know, we have a shitload of bees we're going to put through the sun roof.
and we rigged the locks so they can't get out.
and when they do get out, we got a couple of marbles for them.
this is the Beehive Limo.
last movie, you shit in a damn van and now you get to shit in a limo.
Yeah, you're stepping it up. You're stepping it up, dude.
Oh, this isn't good.
dude, close that fucking sun roof, dude!
fuck! Fuck! We're locked in!
Oh, my God, that sucks!
they're fucking stinging my legs!
get the fuck off of me, dude! You're getting them over here.
you guys are fucking dicks, man. Fuck.
they're on my feet!
the poor driver's running around, freaking out.
that's so good.
sorry, bros.
I pissed myself.
one just got me, right now, as we speak. Look at that.
fuck.
that was real funny, fuckers. - Is there even a photo shoot?
we're here with the Three 6 Mafia, and it's time for the Rake Jump.
do it!
what an idiot.
I'm going to pay this motherfucker right here 200 smackeroos, it's not counterfeit, it's real, to eat horse shit.
but it's all furry, though.
eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! - Go! Go! Go! Go!
really eat it, though. Chew, chew, chew!
swallow it!
put your shades up! - Hold the 200.
come on, soldier! - Don't even think about not swallowing.
it's so dry!
don't even think about it!
swallow it! - Don't you even think about it.
don't you even think about it.
he ain't soft! - Swallow it! Swallow it, nigga!
give him a beer, give him a beer. Give it to him, give it to him!
really eat it, though.
I'm watching you. - Yes, sir.
here, man.
dude, your breath smells like shit!
we're here with Daniel Alvarez from ALS Technologies and...
why don't you explain what this is and what we're gonna be doing?
well, this is the 460 Stingmore Mine.
it has approximately 700 . 45-caliber rubber balls in it.
they'll fly out of there at about 500 feet per second.
they use these charges on the outside of embassies to protect the gates from people trying to break in.
looks like it's gonna suck. - It is. I promise.
fire in the hole.
fuck that, dude. - Fucking Christ!
that is great!
I'm about to, like, have an anxiety attack.
I just can't do this one. It's just too gnarly.
dude, Knoxville is...
if Knoxville goes in there, dude,
I'll French kiss him.
are you insane? - No. All you got to do is stand there.
Yeah, and get killed. Look at that thing. That thing blew the hell up.
it's just loud. It's loud. It's going to hurt really bad, but it's just loud.
you're nuts.
no, no, no. Come on. It's footage. - You're nuts.
son of a... Fuck you.
holy shit!
all you guys are fucking assholes.
you all right, Bam? - You all right?
my God.
are you crying? - I think he's hurt.
can we give Bam some water?
maybe a Shirley Temple.
I'm crying. I'm a fucking skateboarder and I'm getting shot.
they all went for my stomach.
I got hit in the legs worse.
those... Did any get me in the face?
you got hit in the stomach pretty good.
that was great. - That was.
Thanks, fellows. - Yeah. Appreciate it.
Hey, is this okay?
then we're good.
do you like painting models?
Yeah, but I don't need models for this type of work.
okay.
it looks very vaginal and feminine. - Well, thank you.
and sexual. - Thank you.
Yes, thank you. It's beautiful. - Thank you.
it's time to play a game with a bunch of these medicine balls.
and they're heavy as shit.
it's on!
this is Medicine Ball Dodgeball. - In the dark.
can't see anything.
what did you think? - That was fun. Let's never do that again.
ever!
holy...
who'd want to do that? You're not doing that.
who's going first? - What rhymes with Dunn?
fun.
ready, sailor? - No.
this is dumb. - This is going to be dope.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my God. Oh, jeez.
get me out of this!
you're a fucking dick.
that was mean.
he needs help.
that was so mean.
you are an asshole.
that was totally not me. I had nothing to do with it.
you pulled it down!
I didn't!
Oh, my God, my hip. I think I gave birth.
Hi, I'm John Waters, and this is the Magic Trick.
we're gonna make Wee Man disappear.
Where'd he go?
very nice.
that's great.
you're the best magician ever, John.
thank you so much. Thank you.
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville and I'm here with Mat Hoffman and Tony Hawk and this is the Gauntlet.
I just gave him a chest pass!
open the windows!
this is the Toro Totter.
it's me and Pontius vs. Dunn and Bam and the last man on the teeter-totter is the winner.
it's gonna be a bloodbath.
Oh, yes!
what did I do?
what did I do?
dunn, stay there!
so why did I agree to do this one?
Ryan, run! Ryan, run!
my God.
shit.
bam, where are you going?
I am not doing that.
fuck that.
down to two!
I got hit in the back good.
Hey, Knoxville. Oh, shit!
God damn it. Fucking shit. Fuck.
you all right? - Yeah. Hold on.
what do you mean, "Hold on"? The bull's not going to hold on.
Oh, my fucking leg! God damn, these bulls are strong.
Oh, God.
I'm not out!
Oh, my God.
I'm still not out!
all right, that's it. That's it.
Oh, my God.
keep God out of California!
tell Charlie Daniels to write a song about this!
God is out! He can have the other 48.
or 49, whatever.
God, I landed straight on my head. Oh, man, that hurt.
dude, I'm fucked.
I'm Steve-O and sorry, Dad, but nobody's going to miss this for the world.
this is the Butt Chug.
Oh, no.
I'll hold this while you bulldog it. - Get it in there.
ram it in there. - It's really got to get in there.
open wide! - Oh, my God.
take it.
just relax. Relax. Yeah, do your little...
I'm staring right down Main Street. It's not looking any good at all.
you're starting to enjoy that, aren't you?
Oh, shit. - There it goes! There it goes!
keep it going. - There we go.
chug, chug it!
take it all! - Oh, yeah!
take it. - I think your asshole's prehensile.
you got it! You got it!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
you got this! Keep on going!
come on, you've almost got it!
two more sips left.
Oh, my God. - Give me a profile, Steve.
he's peeing like a girl!
steve-o, if your asshole can't see the camera, then the camera can't see your asshole.
the camera's over here! - Right there, right there, right there.
look at Lance! Lance can't stop laughing.
he's doesn't know how to face the cameras when he's peeing.
Oh, my God.
I think we broke Lance. - I know.
I think I still have beer in my ass, but I can't get it out.
use the bottle. Put the bottle up your ass.
use the plunger! - Yeah, plunge his asshole.
you'd better shit piss, asswipe!
all right, let's go to the bar.
perfect.
fuck.
I'm Ryan Dunn, and this is the Rocket Cart.
Bye-bye.
I think I broke my tailbone. - Really? On the water?
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville and this is the Anaconda Ball Pit.
Oh, fuck!
I have on a cup and that still hurts.
anacondas are expert at camouflage. They're ambush hunters.
so, what does that mean? - They surprise you.
I don't know if I'm gonna be that surprised.
you guys got to catch these guys, man. They tried to kill J-Lo and Ice Cube.
Yeah, I know. I know.
something in your mike? - Don't fucking push me.
I'm on your team.
you got him.
get the other camera.
grab him.
fuck!
Oh, man.
dude, he is bleeding a lot. - Yeah.
he's starting to smell you guys.
dude, you guys are doing excellent.
real good. You guys got it.
get him. You got him.
got him! You guys got him.
Oh, no, Dunn's getting coiled. Oh, shit.
get your fucking hands off me!
you guys have been doing good.
Where'd his head go? - He's buried.
you got him! - Yeah!
I have seized the snake. - Yeah.
it's fucking wrapped around my arm.
just take him to Manny. Take him to Manny.
Hey, Manny, come here a minute.
I got him.
Oh, my God, you got nailed.
I didn't do anything. He did all the work.
all right. We seized the snake.
run, Ryan, run.
Oh, shit. We forgot about the other snake.
this is the Ice Horse.
see if your balls will stick to the horse.
come on! - You want me to do it?
for the bros.
it's for the bros. Come on.
it's not gonna stick. - Yeah, it can stick.
you just need a little water.
anybody got some water?
great. - Thanks!
don't think about it. Just do it.
you are assholes.
God, your legs are white.
here. You've got to really get the water on the balls.
Oh, that's horrible-looking!
it's yanking my hair!
are you done?
what an ass! - Oh, my God!
it ripped my skin off.
look at the blister.
look at him gallop.
Hey! There's poop, hair and more poop!
I'm Wee Man, and this is the Swamp Chute.
holy shit, dude. You all right?
what? I can't hear, kind of.
I can't hear, kind of!
you skipped across the water like a rock.
dude, you were at least an 80-mile-an-hour fastball.
Oh, my God.
when you step into this suit, magic happens.
today, we're in Carmen de Arrico with our friend Serg, and he is going to show us how to milk a horse.
the way we're gonna do that is, they're gonna bring over a stallion who's gonna be hot to trot.
and they're gonna have the mare here.
and as soon as the stallion mounts the mare, we're going to grab the stallion's penis and put it into this fake horse vagina.
the old switcheroo.
what a mean trick.
here we go. - Here comes the stallion.
he's got the craziest look in his eye.
I've seen that same look in your eye, Pontius.
it's game on, guys.
Oh, boy. Here we go. Here we go.
Oh, boy.
okay. We got the penis into the fake horsy vagina.
I think I feel the tip of it.
somebody cradle the balls.
he lasts longer than you, Steve-O.
success!
Oh, my God. - He just pleasured a horse.
is it okay to drink?
Yeah.
no problem.
if I do this, this gives me an out for something bad I'm going to do in the future.
Absolutely. Absolutely.
all right. It's on video. - Okay.
that is such a huge load.
I don't know, man. I could have pictured...
can you test that out?
that's semen, all right.
I never puke, ever, and I really almost puked then.
I'm ashamed of myself.
I really am.
I'm completely ashamed of myself.
ready? - Yeah, I'm ready. Are you ready?
you're not going to break through, anyway.
Pontius, you think you can do two boards?
Yeah.
what's Bruce Lee do? That power-breathing.
I think I got it.
Oh, my God!
I was so not ready for that!
we're at the Widowmaker and this is the Big Tire Race.
I can't get in this thing. - Yes, you can.
I guarantee you're getting in it.
Oh, crap.
on your mark! - Fuck!
get set! Go!
you are fucked. - Oh, shit!
I'm stuck in here!
dude.
we got you, buddy.
I hate that. I hate it so bad!
fucking sucky.
why do you hate it? - I'm bouncing in my fucking head.
you got it, Ehren. - Here, Ehren.
Jesus Christ, you got a fat fucking ass. - You got to help!
Oh, fuck!
we're here in India and we found a leech healer and these boys need a little healing.
doc, can you help us? - Yeah, why not?
that sounds good. Let's put one on Dave's nut.
well, don't hand it to me.
all right, gentlemen.
that's the biggest leech I ever saw.
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!
Oh, my God. - My God.
No!
he's on. He's on.
he's on. He's on.
fuck! Shit!
help.
you got to leave it on for a while.
fuck this.
you got to leave it on.
you got to let...
fucking shit.
please, take it off me.
please, will you take it off me? - All right, I'm gonna take it off!
please.
don't worry about a thing. - Take it off.
just get it off me. - This is gonna be so funny.
just get it the fuck off me.
wait, let's see what you got.
fuck you!
fuck!
and now for the grand finale, the leech monocle.
Thanks, Doc.
Jesus Christ. - Look over here. Look over here.
okay, this is the mouth.
here we go.
get him on there.
come on, leech.
Oh, he's eyeballing you.
I think we'd...
he's on my eyeball!
no, wait, wait!
okay, stand up and keep your eye open.
keep your eye open. Keep your eye open, Steve-O!
steve-o, keep your eye open! Open!
open! Open, toward... No!
look!
relax. Relax.
does it look cool?
Yeah. It got you about right there.
I just had a leech chomp my eyeball.
Yes!
way to go.
are these all for sale today?
Yeah. $5.
Oh, why, they're beautiful shirts.
they're beautiful colors.
this one's really nice.
do you think that... - Oh, shit.
I'd like to buy, maybe, the one...
Hey, your titty out.
what's that? - He said your shirt is open.
put this shirt on?
no, your shirt...
your thing is hanging out of your shirt, ma'am. What are you doing?
put your shirt back on.
which one was the one you thought I should get?
leave me alone!
bam is absolutely terrified of snakes, so we brought David Weathers here to surprise him during the next bit.
king cobra.
Jesus...
Oh, my God.
it's cool. It's been de-venomized.
I'm Bam Margera and this is the Wind Tunnel.
Oh, my God. What?
bam, cock out. Cock out.
no, no, no! No, no!
a fucking cobra, dude?
yo, yo, yo, I don't like him staring like that.
Oh, dude, you guys are fucking such total dickheads.
are you crying? - Yeah.
Oh, yeah!
he's on to you.
I'm done.
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Dave, Dave!
yo, that is coolest shit I've seen in long time.
white boy don't like snakes.
eh?
what's your strategy up there?
my strategy is staying up on the fucking van because I don't trust anybody.
I should have thought about it more, but I was sipping on beer.
I was like, "Why the fuck is snake dude in Louisiana"?
then I do my bit and then all of a sudden a king cobra comes into the fucking thing.
I'm like... Dude, I'm staying up here.
you fuckers are asses. I don't trust anybody.
and you made me waste my beer.
fucking hell. - Fuck this.
I'm Steve-O, and this is the Fart Mask.
I took a fucking shit in it!
there's shit in there.
I got a shitty ass. I got to go wipe it out.
that's like, the perfect poop.
I'm Dave England and this is my big, green ball.
I need you to put baby powder in my butt hole.
you need me to put...
put a lot in there. - Yeah, yeah. That's great.
who was that?
did it go "poof"?
did it go "poof"?
it did?
sorry.
Oh, sorry.
do you have these in size 11?
let me just see.
these are good.
sir! - Leave me alone!
you come on in here.
you go that way. I don't care, dude.
police!
he's a frisky little bugger!
I am so sorry!
Oh, my God! It reminded me of my ex-wife!
it's the middle of the night.
we're gonna wake up Phil and swap him with Preston, and Ape's gonna lose her mind.
this is the Switcheroo.
it's all right.
don't be afraid to get frisky.
I'm gonna kill you in a minute.
Phil, back up.
back up!
back up.
Oh, my God. What are you doing?
are you all right? Jesus Christ. Are you...
are you...
Phil?
Phil?
Phil?
what are you doing? What are you doing?
what? - What?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
who is that? Who is that?
who is that?
that's not your dad. Who is that? Who is that? Where's the light?
how you doing, ma'am? - What? Who?
I went to get a drink. What's going on?
Oh, my God!
man, I just felt like I was committing assault.
Phil, he copped a feel.
he got away with it, then.
have you ever been with another man before?
did he feel fatter?
did he feel fatter?
you can answer. I won't be mad.
I just assaulted you! You can say whatever you want!
no, you felt shorter.
no, you can say anything you want. - You felt that part?
that's it. I'm going to bed now.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, shit.
what was that shit? It's fucking in my eyes.
what the fuck was that?
Oh, my...
I fucking don't understand.
what the fuck did you do to me?
what the fuck was that?
that fucked me up, man.
let's go inside, man.
are you okay? - Oh, fuck, dude.
let's get inside. We got a medic inside.
it's moments like these when you know Johnny Knoxville is one gnarly dude.
I'm so glad I'm not the star of this movie.
Knoxville's gonna see what the moon's gonna look like.
he is gonna go definitely 60 feet up in the air.
he's gonna get annihilated. But I don't wanna tell him that.
you're gonna be just fine!
Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville, and this is my Big Red Rocket.
go.
what the fuck was that?
holy shit!
Oh, my God, he almost died and he's dancing.
usually, rockets fail backwards and forwards, I was told, but there was a rocket that came out the side.
if it had been, like, right here, that would have been a picture wrap on old Knoxville.
and now we're trying it again. It's rocket launch, take two.
I'm scared just watching.
I want a Lance helmet. - I have full, like, adrenaline.
even if the rocket doesn't blow up on me this time, there's really not a lot of great ways for it to end, anyway.
this isn't the best idea ever. - Yes, it is.
I'm Johnny Knoxville, and I'm going to the moon!
later!
are you okay?
give us a thumbs-up!
so what's going on, Preston? What are we doing today?
we're playing a prank on Danger Ehren.
I think that we're gonna decorate him up like a terrorist, with full makeup and wardrobe, and him and Dimitry are gonna call a cab, the idea being to play a prank on the taxi driver, that they wanna go to the airport,
I guess to commit some sort of terrorist act.
so, Ehren, where are you going? - Yeah, where are you going?
I'm going to Burbank Airport.
and, meanwhile, we've substituted the taxi driver with Jay Chandrasekhar...
and he is going to punch Ehren in the face and possibly pull a gun on him.
if he tries to say we're filming, just go, "Don't talk to me anymore!"
and slap him like this. You can slap him a lot, too.
I don't know how he'll handle this. It's pretty high-pressure.
and I don't think he does well under pressure.
all right, so here I am trying to contribute to Ehren McGhehey's new beard.
and I hope he knows that I skipped showering for about a week and a half just to make this a little bit more gross.
sorry, Ehren.
look at the mane on him!
someone's got to pick that out of their teeth.
I'd be so bummed if I was Ehren right now.
you, like, put powder in there?
Yeah, I put a little Gold Bond on this morning.
tickles!
one of the most toxic concoctions known to man.
it's a disease nest.
mine, you don't need a lot of.
it's like just a little bit of rattlesnake venom will get you.
is that the whole patch?
wait, I'm just wondering. Mike, is that a crab?
what's that white speck on top? - What is that?
that's a crab.
Mike's got crabs.
Hey, guys! Guys! Mike's got crabs!
what's that?
this? Spirit gum. It's like, the adhesive that's gonna keep the beard on.
how's the dialog? I mean, I've never, like, done this before.
it's a game, you know. - Compliment him, followed by an insult.
this is fucked, dude. - Just don't break the character.
all right, Ehren, the main thing, you cannot tell him you're from any country in particular.
this is such a good bit. It's muffed up, but it's great.
close your mouth. Relax.
we're making you look like what we think this guy expects a terrorist to look like.
you're not making fun of anybody. We're just trying to scare the cab driver.
I kind of already know that.
father. Hello, Father.
you shut up. I told you to come here earlier.
I'm sorry, Father. - You are late. You cannot be accepted.
I have disgraced you.
where have you been, you little bastard?
I have been making a number two. - Oh.
ehren, you are king.
thank you very much.
what are you laughing at? You people, you.
bam Margera and shit.
look how sweet the beard is, Jeff.
hello.
hello. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too.
I look creepy, man. I wish that I was born this way.
you sound like schtick now. Don't turn it into a comedy routine.
no, very good. I know what to do now.
no, I think there's gonna be some...
so, we have two cameras following...
excuse me.
Hello?
I'd like to say, for not ever having done makeup before your disguise,
I feel pretty... Like I've achieved something.
I feel like I'm eating pubes right now.
I got this shit all in my mouth.
is it on the corner? - Yes, it's like I'm chewing on this shit.
is this real hair? - No. Go like this.
I'm going to get it out of your mouth.
okay. Does that feel better?
well, I still got it on the back of my tongue.
there. Out?
Yeah, very good.
very expert. - Thank you.
Hello, my name is Ehren McGhehey and this is Terror Taxi.
now I shall call to taxi.
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the best skit of this movie.
the cab's here. We're on. We're on. Let's do it.
he has no clue. - I don't want the makeup to bleed.
we get to listen the whole time? - I'm so glad I hopped in this van.
Oh, my God.
he's feeling the part so hard and he has no clue.
it's all downhill from here.
to the Burbank Airport, please.
okay.
where are you guys from? - It's none of your business, I'm sorry.
you got any luggage or...
no, no luggage where we going.
I do not like this country very much, though.
I like the countryside, though. The countryside is good.
and the breasts.
Yeah, I'm married.
what size is your wife's breasts?
Yeah, well, let's just leave my wife out of it, okay?
very good, very good.
are they bigger than a D?
I love Ds.
do you want me to fucking pull over? I mean, is that the fuck...
no. I'm very sorry. I will not talk.
there's an airplane, there!
we are very, very close.
boom! We are very, very close.
what does that mean, "Boom"?
boom! Like, "Boom! Kaboom!" And all that.
there is the airport back there. Which way are you going?
where you going? Where are you going? Where are you going?
where are you going, man? Where are you going?
do not go down the alleyway. Very scary. Stop it! Fuck you!
fuck you! Fuck you! You are a crazy man. Fuck you up!
fuck you! Asshole!
shit fucker! Shit fucker! Asshole!
fucking money, I give you money, lots of money!
boom! Boom! Boom! I'll blow us up right now!
right now! Right now I'll blow you up!

I got a bomb, dude!
fuck you! I got a fucking bomb, dude!
dude, get the fuck off of me!
get the fuck off me! Get the fuck off of me!
we're just filming a skit!
get the fuck off of me!
what do you want me to do? - Get on the floor.
what do you want me to do? - Get on the fucking floor.
just get on the floor, dude.
lay down.
this is fucked.
lay down on your face.
what the fuck, dude? I mean, come on!
I fucking knew it, dude. He fucking carries a gun. This is bullshit.
just do what he says. Just do what the fuck he says, dude.
stay there. I'm gonna fucking call the cops.
this guy's got a fucking gun, dumbshits!
come on! Get the fuck out here!
don't fucking move!
don't point the gun at me anymore, you piece of shit!
then lay down!
fuck! - Just fucking relax, dude.
fuck, it's a gun, dude.
fuck!
what the fuck do you want from us? - Get up!
get up, Ehren. Get the fuck up.
Why? Why should I get up? You have me on the fucking ground.
ehren, he has a fucking gun.
just get the fuck up, dude. We gotta get the fuck out of here.
get in there. - No, fuck you.
just do what he says, dude. - Get the fuck in the trunk.
he's got a fucking gun pointed at me, fuckface, asshole, cocksucker!
get in the fucking trunk! - Dude, get in the trunk.
if you fuck me up, I will fucking find you, somehow, or something.
just get in. - Seriously.
why am I getting in the fucking back of this fucking cab, dude?
he's got a fucking gun! - Get the fuck back here!
dude, just fucking put the gun down!
you shut the fuck up!
Oh, fuck, dude! - Holy shit!
what the fuck, dude? - Get the fuck on the ground!
I'm fucking serious!
I'm bleeding.
no, no! Dude, we're filming.
fuck you! Get the fuck out of here! - No, we're fucking filming!
that's Bam Margera, dumbshit! He's famous!
look, there's cameras, there's a sound guy.
we're filming a fucking movie, dude.
this guy's got a dynamite vest on!
Hey, put the gun down, dude!
what the fuck?
he shot me!
Preston, you fucking idiot! Get me the fuck out of here!
fuck this! - Please, sir! Please, sir!
fuck! Fuck! - Sir, please!
please! Stop! - Sir, please!
what the fuck?
dude, get me out of here!
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
Oh, God, no!
Oh, fuck. I'm going to fucking die.
why the fuck did I agree to do this shit? Dude, it wasn't even my fucking idea.
fucking fuck.
Oh, my God, dude.
I can't believe that shit, dude.
what the fuck, are you an actor or some bullshit?
come on. - Fucking crap, dude!
I almost shit my pants. I'm not even kidding.
dude, that was so awesome.
Oh, God, dude, I'm so happy right now. Seriously.
Oh, my God. I was so worried.
fuck.
I get it. It's a prank on a prank, yeah.
he fucking pulled out a gun on me, dude.
look where your beard came from.
look, look! I'll show you!
look at my patch!
look! That's all our pubes.
you should try and get that off.
Oh, my God, dude, that sucks.
every time it gets fucking worse and worse.
you guys didn't fucking superglue that, did you?
No!
that sucks! I told you not to do that!
ehren, come on! Why are you getting mad at me?
I got your dick hair all over my fucking face!
this sucks, dude! Give me something to get this shit off.
this shit was in my mouth!
how are you going to explain crabs on your face?
this shit was all over my fucking mouth!
it wasn't from my dick. Some of it was from my ass.
Oh, God, this is so bad.
look at this. This is from Derek.
okay, who brought crabs to the party? Fuck me.
one of the guys had crabs!
seriously, like, was the dick hair necessary?
Absolutely.
like, was that the big payoff?
like, "Ha, ha, dick hairs glued on his face"?
is it itching? - It's in my mouth.
why'd you put it in your mouth?
I'm Johnny Knoxville and this is the Bear Trap.
get it off!
get it off! Get it off!
fuck!
I'll Jackass Two your ass. Do me a favor.
and you wonder why I drink? I drink to steady my nerves.
I was so steady, I couldn't move last week!
I had vodka and prune juice. It's called a piledriver.
I'll be okay.
please, God, don't let there be a Jackass Three.
please, please, God, don't let there be a Jackass Three.
I don't even like doing Two.
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville.
welcome to India!
can I get off his dick...
way to go.
I don't like this at all!
sorry, bro. I didn't see you there.
I was headed over to Produce.
you knocked out my tooth again!
look at Rick!
he fucking swallowed it?
horse cum!
I'm not getting paid to be on camera, you fucking dick.
that was great.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, what have you got?
marker.
don't drop your shit.
just act like it hurts, okay?
Wow. I actually feel energized after that.
Oh my God, look! Point it at the cameraman!
into the sink!
in the sink!
in the sink! - In the sink!
are you lubed up? - Yeah!
Hey, they're ready to go. Do you want to shoot it?
you all right, buddy?
I'm all right, man.
water-based lubricants. Friend or foe?
you be the judge.
okay, I can't breathe.
can you take it off, please?
Oh, is this your fruit? - No.
Oh, these are beautiful! They're so round and lush.
how much is the oranges? - $6.
okay.
I accidentally cut myself. I need a doctor, dude.
doctor!
some of them were on planes that landed in the middle of nowhere.
they've been walking for weeks.
they must have gone through hell.
Oh, my God.
there's a woman in that group of refugees that Bill is processing.
I think you should talk to her.
Hello, Rob. Someone on my team sold us all out.
you're smart enough to know that they would say anything to get you to talk.
gray: At current levels of consumption, we will be completely out of gas and diesel in two weeks.
we can live without power for now, but we won't see spring if we don't eat.
all right, look, the further out you get, the hairier the roads are, and food being as scarce as it is, there's bound to be trouble out there.
MIMI: Why are they following us?
stanley, hold on!
Jake! It's Mom and Dad, honey!
you're going to be all right.
so, I'm being watched?
Sarah: It's the Old Man.
he's coming for us, using us against each other.
if they kill me, they will never find the package.
I have something in my possession, and there's people out there that want it.
and that puts you, me and the kids in danger here.
then listen to me...
Sarah is not on our side.
I'm telling you, Robert, she's not here to help us.
the HUNTER: Hawkins is starting to put the pieces together.
he needs to be eliminated.
I know.
why are you stalling on this one?
because this one is different.
JOHNSTON: You won't make it out of Kansas with the fuel you've got, and you're not going to find another drop out there.
the folks who left last week are probably in Arizona by now.
if they weren't murdered on the highway.
it is suicide to leave, Ridley.
there's no food, no heat.
it's suicide if we stay.
stanley: This... this is everything.
I mean, it's every farm.
at least until the spring crops come in, and that could take months.
and what if we don't factor in the refugees?
they're a part of this town now.
a lot of extra mouths to feed.
they've done their part, Gray.
they've helped hunt, cut firewood...
resources they use up five times faster than they supply them.
when the windmills come in from New Bern, most of our fuel issues will be solved.
what about every day until then?
JOHNSTON: Ridley and his group are about to leave.
well, if people want to try and make it on their own, that's their right.
you know as well as I do that come springtime, we'll find their bodies out there.
well, what do you want me to do, Johnston?
wh-what am I missing that's not on that board?
you find it for me,' cause I don't see it.
without some "X" factor, we're not going to make it through the winter.
not all of us.
we have to make some hard decisions.
and I think the last ones in should be the first ones to go.
clear the streets!
we need to clear the streets!
who's in charge here?
um, I'm Gray Anderson.
I'm the mayor of Jericho.
glad to meet you, Mayor Anderson.
I'm Gunnery Sergeant Hill. Fourth MAR-DIV, Fourth Tank Battalion, Charlie Company.
so you're...?
sir, we're the United States Marines, and we're here to help.
they sent the marines?
hill: We were deployed to Western Kansas to set up a firm base and prep the outlying towns for the arrival of the Army Corps of Engineers.
now that we've won the war, it's time to start rebuilding.
war? What war?
you didn't hear?
no.
we lost all communications after the EMP.
well, we nuked the hell out of North Korea and Iran.
so they were behind it?
from what I hear, which isn't much, Iran financed it, North Korea supplied the bombs.
we've got troops all over the world going after the terrorists who snuck them in, but at least we took out the big dogs.
what happens now?
the largest reconstruction effort in the history of the country.
so there's somebody finally in charge?
the former secretary of HHS is now the president.
Jake: We heard there were six guys from six different capitals claiming to be president.
hill: Resolved.
the federal government is reunifying in Columbus, Ohio.
how did they decide on Columbus?
all I know is, my orders are coming from the commanding officer of the Fourth Battalion, and those are to restore lights, power and infrastructure to Kansas, one town at a time.
w-wait, wait. When is that going to happen?
should have your shelves full of Oreos and Hot Pockets by the end of the year.
welcome back to the grid, Jericho.
thank God for the US Marines.
Ooh-rah.
Hey! Hey!
it's over.
there are kids out here. Get a room.
come on. We should have been on the road yesterday.
well, I'm packed.
Hi. We're all fueled up.
how are we doing?
we'll be ready when we're ready.
I'll get the rest of my things from downstairs.
how many more times are we going to have to move?
this should do it.
Really? You're going to stay in one place from now on?
sergeant Green.
Oh... Marine Corps?
Ah, hell, no. Army Rangers.
well, I'll try not to hold it against you.
listen, Gunny, how long before the engineers get here?
could be two days, could be two weeks.
in the meantime, why don't you get a wish list of what you need, and I'll forward that on to Battalion Headquarters in Dodge City, and we'll start to get y'all back on your feet. Roger that.
just tell me how I can be of service.
uh, going to need a command post.
Oh, use the sheriff's office.
great.
excuse me. Uh...
if you guys are going to be here for a while, why don't I take your men over to my tavern.
Thanks, ma'am, my troops could use it.
Wymore! Front and center!
move it, move it!
muster up and follow this young lady here.
the liberty call is sounded, but remember...conduct yourselves like marines. Aye, sir.
don't you "sir" me, PFC.
I work for a living. Dismissed!
aye, aye, Gunnery Sergeant.
couple of months ago, I would have had that kid doing push-ups till he puked, but, uh, they've been through a lot.
I understand. Anything else we can do?
well, Sergeant, uh... one other thing.
corporal Mullin!
Hi. Uh, I'm looking to scavenge some replacement parts.
our radio, well, it took a couple of pretty good hits.
uh, do you have any idea where I could start?
Jake: Maybe I could help.
Oh, Lance Corporal Mullin.
so you're the town's electronics expert?
no, I'm not an expert at anything.
but I can improvise. -I'll take that.
we'll see what we can find.
Hey.
Hey.
so, uh...
I've been thinking...maybe leaving my family isn't such a good idea.
what?
Why? We've been over this.
they-they're not safe here with you.
I know. There are people out there who would hurt them in order to get to me.
but at least I understand the dangers.
I can protect them. -You're not thinking straight.
this is my family, Sarah.
it never mattered before.
Yeah, well, now it does.
what's it going to take someone slitting your wife's throat before you get it? -Hey, hey...
you're right.
we will drop them at the safe house, and then we'll keep moving.
it's the right thing for them.
Yeah.
I just realized... Hmm?
if the government is up and running, you know what that means, right?
no. -Paperwork.
they'll need accountants again.
does that mean I'm back in debt?
don't be so negative. New York made it.
come next summer, I'll be taking walks though Central Park.
what?
dude! This is awesome!
I could totally be a marine.
: dude! I could totally see that happening...
: except for everything about you.
God, I...
don't worry about her.
it's a phase, trust me.
the minute everything calms down, he's as good as gone.
Yeah, yeah, maybe you can give him a ride out of town on the way to New York.
thinking about leaving this town is not the same thing as thinking about leaving you.
no? Well, it adds up to the same thing, Mimi.
maybe you could come with me.
Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry. That's not my life.
well, this isn't mine.
I've missed you.
me, too.
we should get going.
Mm...
start loading up the truck, huh?
go on, get out of here.
Hey.
Hey.
I heard what happened. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm better than the truck.
be able to quit worrying about you one of these days, right?
Hey, Jake.
amazing, huh?
Yeah, it's great news.
so... I'll see you later.
how are most of the towns out there?
let's just say I haven't seen anything like this since we entered the CZ.
contamination Zone.
you're in CZ-12, and you're better off than most.
that's hard to imagine.
try taking a walk through what's left of Lawrence, Kansas.
what's it like?
buildings are all gone.
people who are left are fighting their neighbors for food and water.
makes you wonder if the survivors are the lucky ones.
Hey, Mary.
Mary... uh, we need a transistor for their radio.
can we take apart the jukebox?
Oh, you're going to take my music?
isn't there anything else you can take apart?
you've got three Spin Doctors albums on here.
trust me, it's a public service.
don't worry, there's an old ham radio in City Hall.
maybe we can take that apart.
thanks anyway.
Bye. Bye.
Oh, hey, big guy.
thank you.
you're welcome.
Hey.
I think you have something of mine.
sweetie, let's sit down on the couch.
your dad and I have some talking to do.
you go ahead, Sam.
just play with your coloring books.
this is what you want, right?
among other things.
you been lying to me, Robert.
when did you fall back in love with your wife?
it's okay.
you go back to your book. Go ahead.
we tried to institute rationing early on, but it took some time for people to accept that we were really on our own.
looks like you did a better job than most towns I've seen.
town's lucky to have a military man in charge.
well, I guess we made out all right.
with salt from my mine, we've been able to do some trading with nearby towns.
your town seems to have been blessed.
that said, uh...I can't say you'll be a priority on the list.
um, uh... Wait a minute-- what list?
we got detachments all over Kansas assessing each town's needs.
relief is given on an as needed basis. -Wait a second.
you're saying that because we planned better than others it'll count against us? -Now, Gray, we can make out for a while longer if we have to.
that's easy for you to say.
you're not being held accountable.
why don't you give me that want list and, uh, I'll see what I can do.
try that one.
perfect.
so you're really not going to tell me what happened?
doc says frostbite.
doctor also say who kicked your ass?
someone ran us off the road.
most of it's a blur.
just, uh, tried to stay alive, you know?
I do.
so, the marines, huh?
Yeah.
is it everything you hoped for?
there are moments.
but when I signed up, I never thought I'd be fighting Americans.
good people forced to do bad things.
that's got to be rough. I'm sorry.
it's not your problem.
what?
just, uh, wondering why someone like you would join the marines.
someone like me?
I had an office job until a few years ago, but I got bored.
I wanted to see the world.
have you? -I've seen Omaha.
you? -What, seen the world? Yeah.
Yeah, I just saw all the wrong places.
man, you have this brooding, bad-boy thing down to an art.
Robert: The video I was sent before the attacks, those people were not holding you captive.
you were just... what, you were playing me?
me playing you?
we were living together.
I showed up here and you have a family again.
Hey, it's okay. It's just a...a story, you know?
it's just a story we're telling.
go back to your book.
you made me promises, Robert.
who were the people in that video?
is that who you're working for? -I was.
now I'm working for myself.
so why don't you give me what I want, and then this story can have a happy ending.
so what are you going to do when the marines finally cut you loose?
I try not to think about it.
that means you have.
after everything I've seen...I'd like to find a nice little town and just settle in for the duration.
I don't think those exist anymore.
I just found out they do.
what about you?
you ever thought about flying again?
maybe for the military?
sure. Safer than being on the ground, right?
not if you're a radio operator.
I'm the safest of all. I get to ride in the tank.
but if you get to ride in the tank, how did the radio get shot?
what, you think a girl can't get out and kick some ass every once in a while?
okay...
who you trying to call on that thing anyway?
uh, division headquarters in Dodge City.
that's about 200 miles away.
this thing's made it farther.
of course, that was before it took some rounds.
fourth MAR-DIV.
fourth MAR-DIV, this is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
authentication "thunder." Over.
fourth MAR-DIV. Fourth MAR-DIV.
this is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
authentication "thunder." Over.
: Lima Charlie Thunder.
this is Charlie Company Actual.
we've been trying to raise you on this frequency for days.
division needs the entire fourth tank battalion RTB ASAP.
do you copy?
aye, aye, sir.
make that most tricky-tick, Corporal.
Roger that, Charlie Company Actual, out.
what's going on?
we just got ordered back to Dodge City.
what are you going to do with the package, Sarah?
sell it.
and get as far away from here as possible.
what happened to you?
the last few months,
I've learned two things.
everybody has a price.
and everybody lies.
Hey. Hey, no. No.
mom! Sit still, Sam.
take your... Stay there.
I was just having a conversation with your husband about what's more important to him, his job or his family.
Hey! Hey, Gunny! Gunny!
why are you leaving?
because we were ordered to.
sorry, but I can't reveal operational orders.
army Corps of Engineers will be through eventually.
eventually? How long?
sir, listen, I'm sorry, but I just don't know.
you ready to roll? Good to go, Gunny.
but I don't know about the tank.
don't know if we have enough fuel to make it back to Dodge City.
leave it behind if we have to.
we'll post Sigloch and Kent here till we can make it back.
sergeant, without armor we're sitting ducks for those highwaymen. -We're marines. We'll make do.
I can get you fuel.
not much, but enough to get you back to Dodge.
just give me an hour. -I'm listening.
plus whatever supplies you need.
but I just need assurances that Jericho will be taken care of.
there's three C-130s full of Red Cross supplies that are supposed to arrive in Kansas in 12 days.
I guarantee you'll be at the top of their list.
that's all I ask.
all right, people, listen up.
we're going to stand down for one hour.
when the relief effort comes, are you guys coming with it?
no. You're going have to flirt with a whole new batch of grunts.
and the Corps of Engineers are nowhere near as cute as I am.
you should think about coming back when you get out.
what would I do here?
well, that's a question we're all asking ourselves.
but you're a good fit.
you know, before all this started,
I might have agreed with you.
but, uh...
I won't make it back here.
corporal Mullin!
Yes, Gunnery Sergeant.
why is your gear not loaded up?
uh... Don't answer that.
we're headed over to the town hall.
the mayor wants to express his appreciation.
somebody needs to stay here.
you just drew the short straw.
aye, Gunny.
I'm going to go get the last of the supplies from the sheriff's office.
okay.
get the package.
you know I can't do that.
you think I'm going to believe a word you say?
come on. We can work this out.
you had your chance to go with me.
please! -Shut up!
you're losing something tonight.
I promise you that.
only question is, is it going to be something with a heartbeat?
okay.
okay.
I'll get the package.
please put that gun down.
why don't you get Allison down here, too?
man: Lima Charlie Thunder.
this is Charlie Company Actual.
do you copy?
Lima Charlie, it's cold as hell out here.
Hello?
this is Jake Green.
Jake Green, this is an official Marine channel.
get off this...
Hello?
hello. Are you taking fire?
gray: Hey, Gunny!
it's just a little something to remember us by.
hill: This is too kind, Mr. Mayor, but, uh, we really should press on.
gray: No, you can't take off on an empty stomach.
come on in, I got a little surprise for you.
just something to show our gratitude.
come on.
I need you to grab some of our guys from patrol and do a sweep of the area, all right? Take guns.
what, are you... are you kidding?
okay, okay. Well... what am I looking for?
a guy with a radio for starters.
check anywhere within earshot of the fireworks.
all right, maybe it's nothing. Just check.
Stanley? All right? Go! Okay.
I can't talk.
what? It's good talking to you.
ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen.
welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
honored guests.
I was very hopeful that former Sergeant Green might like to say a few words.
uh, well, ladies and gentlemen, um,
marine Corps has a motto-- "Semper fidelity.
always faithful.
and I think it's very fitting that in our darkest hour, it was marines who came to our rescue.
never before in our nation's history has a motto been so tried and so necessary.
so, uh, Gunny, Marines, semper fidelity.
Ooh-rah!
Hoo-wah!
woman: Thank you, thank you for your service.
you bet. Thank you.
so, Gunny, the Fighting Fourth.
seen more than your share of action.
from Iwo to Iraq.
if there's a war, there's the Fourth.
semper fidelity.
Ooh-rah.
Hoo-wah! Hoo-wah!
excuse us a second.
: what is the matter?
what's going on?
: downstairs.
I just, uh...
I heard the fireworks over the marines' radio, and Dodge City is 200 miles away.
what? They've got somebody on the edge of town pretending to be their headquarters.
I sent Stanley and a couple of the guys to check it out.
tell me I'm crazy.
if you are, so am I.
nobody calls an NCO "sir, and a marine would never say, "Hoo-ah.
that's an Army thing.
these guys did both.
Marines are all about detail.
well, if they're not marines, who are they?
people with enough firepower to wipe us out.
and we gave them half the town's supplies.
what do we do?
well, we've got to tell Gray.
how do we get Gray alone?
he's right next to them.
we got to do something about that tank.
that thing gets turned lose on Main Street, it'll be a bloodbath.
well, even if you get that tank, they'll still have a room full of hostages.
she's right.
we better get back before they start to wonder.
try to get a message to Gray, and I'll wait for Stanley.
I'll see what I can do about the tank.
Hey.
how was Dodge City picking up our fireworks?
we pick up pops and pings all the time...
don't! Don't lie to me!
stanley: Hello? Anyone out there?
stanley, is that you?
Jake, we found this guy camping out here with this radio.
says he's with the marines.
I'm going to bring him back.
is any of this real?
the gun's real.
I'm sorry.
you con people out of stale food and enough fuel to get to the next town?
you don't know how bad it is out there.
Yeah, I do.
where did you get all this?
there was a food riot in our refugee camp.
a dozen marines never had a chance against 10, 000 starving people.
so you killed them?
they retreated and we took what they left.
tried to get some food in the next town.
it worked so well, we kept doing it.
don't.
you're not leaving town with those supplies.
don't get yourself killed doing something stupid, Jake.
I don't want that on my conscience.
you don't have it in you.
open it.
step... back.
Darcy: My God.
this has been here the whole time?
it is not armed, and the lead blocks all the radiation...
you brought that into our house?!
we were almost out of here, and you told him, Maggie?
he figured it out.
he heard the fireworks on the radio.
so what do we do with him now?
what do you... what do you mean? Let's just leave.
and what, wait for him to tell the whole town when we're half a mile out?
it'll be Greenville all over again.
we're not killers.
I was a P. E. teacher who saw too many movies.
now I'm a marine.
I'm adapting.
no.
it's him or us.
JOHNSTON: I vote for you.
you know, ammunition being in such short supply,
I doubt those weapons are even loaded.
you want to take that chance?
JOHNSTON: I know damn well this one is.
son of a... bitch!
get your hands up! Get them up!
get up.
how dare you wear that uniform!
it's not a uniform... it's a costume.
half the towns we go through don't even fly the flag.
wait. Everything you said about the war, North Korea, it was all a lie?
some of it we heard, some we made up.
it's anybody's guess what's really going on out there.
well, we still have laws in Jericho, and tomorrow I'm going to let the town decide what to do with you.
we can't do that, Gray.
the hell we can't!
people need to know what we're up against. Not like this.
well, they're going to find out eventually.
Yeah, they will.
and by then, the worst of it will be over.
but food's not enough.
you said it yourself.
without some "X" factor, we don't make it through the winter.
well, this is it.
people need faith just as much as they need food.
and what the hell do we do with them?
then we give a hero's exit.
Ooh-rah.
how can I be sure you won't follow me?
I won't follow you.
not if I take your son with me, you won't.
hey...
my God.
I'll leave him just outside of town.
No!
Allison: Dad! Allie, get them out of here!
you okay? -I'm fine, Dad.
I'm sorry. -Dad...
I'm fine.
let me take this.
you are not fine.
Robert, we are not fine!
how long till-till more people come after you?
huh, after us?
come on, Darling,we're safe here. -Don't...!
we'll never be safe with you.
come on.
let's go. Come on. -Hey.
let's go.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too, baby girl.
move out! Let's go!
Jake: Hey.
look, you're a smart girl, you need to get out before these guys get you killed.
and go where?
towns aren't taking refugees, and there's only one thing they want women for.
stay here... all right, you'll be safe.
it's not going to work.
not after the story we told.
not now, Mimi.
like hell not now, Cornhusker.
Cornhuskers are from Nebraska.
I'm a Jayhawk.
what? What?
you drive me so crazy, and you know that I can't stay here forever, but...the truth is...I can't live without you, either.
Really?
Yes, really.
we got enough food to get all of you a few days down the road.
Hey, how about some water, man?
make do.
you'll leave your weapons on the tank, and you will move out.
do it.
come on.
let's go.
my mind is clearer now
at last, all too well
I can see where we all soon will be [ Sighs ]
if you strip away
the myth from the man
you will see
where we all soon will be
Jesus
you've started to believe the things they say of you
you really do believe
this talk of God is true
and all the good you've done will soon get swept away
you've begun to matter more than the things you say
listen, Jesus I don't like what I see
all I ask is that you listen to me
and remember I've been your right-hand man all along
you have set them all on fire [ Chuckles ]
they think they found the new messiah
and they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong
I remember when this whole thing began
no talk of God then we called you a man
and believe me my admiration for you hasn't died
but every word you say today
gets twisted round some other way
and they'll hurt you if they think you've lied
nazareth, your famous son should have stayed the great unknown
like his father carving wood, he'd have made good table, chair and oaken chest would have suited Jesus best
he'd have caused nobody harm, no one alarm
listen, Jesus, do you care for your race?
don't you see we must keep in our place
we are occupied, have you forgotten
how put down we are
and our conquerors object to another noisy sect
and they'll crush us if we go too far
if we go too far
listen, Jesus, to the warning I give
please remember that I want us to live
but it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour
all Your followers are blind
too much heaven on their minds, come on, Judas. It was beautiful but now it's sour. Don't believe that, Yes, it's all gone sour
listen, Jesus to the warning I give
please remember that I want us to live
so listen, Jesus to the warning I give
I, I just want us to live
it's all gone sour
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
why should you want to know
don't you mind about the future
don't you try to think ahead
save tomorrow for tomorrow
think about today instead what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
Oh, yeah, what's the buzz,tell me what's happening
I could give you facts and figures
give you plans and forecasts when do we ride into Jerusalem
even tell you where I'm going
when do we ride into Jerusalem
when do we ride into Jerusalem
when do we ride into Jerusalem
when do we ride into Jerusalem
why should you want to know
and why are you obsessed with fighting
times and fates you can't defy
if you knew the path we're riding
you'd understand it less than I
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
let me try to cool down your face a bit
let me try to cool down your face a bit
let me try to cool down your face a bit
let me try to cool down your face a bit
[ vocalizing ] Let me try, let me try to cool down your face a bit
let me try to cool down your face a bit
let me try to cool down your face a bit
Mary, ooh, ooh, that is good
while you prattle through your supper
when and where and who and how
she alone has tried to give me
what I need right here and now
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
what's the buzz, tell me what's happening
it seems to me a strange thing
mystifying that a man like you
can waste his time
on women of her kind
Yes, I can understand that
she amuses
but to let her stroke you, kiss your hair, is hardly in your line
it's not that I object to her profession
but she doesn't fit in well with what you teach and say
it doesn't help us if you're inconsistent
they only need a small excuse to put us all away
who are you to criticize her, who are you to despise her
leave her, leave her, let her be now
leave her, leave her, she's with me now
if your slate is clean, then you can throw stones
if your slate is not clean, then leave her alone
come on! Come on! Come on!
go on, Peter. Go on.
I'm amazed that men like you can be so shallow thick and slow
there is not a man among you who knows or cares if I come or go
no, you're wrong, you're very wrong
no, you're wrong, you're very wrong
you, you're wrong, you're very wrong
no, you're wrong, you're very wrong
how can you say that, how can you say that
how can you say that, how can you say that
not one, not one of you
try not to get worried
try not to turn on to
problems that upset you
Oh, don't you know
everything's all right, yes, everything's fine
and we want you to sleep well tonight
let the world turn without you tonight
if we try, we'll get by
so forget all about us tonight
everything's all right, yes, everything's all right, yes
sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you
and anoint you
myrrh for your hot forehead
Oh, then you'll feel everything's all right
Yes, everything's fine
and it's cool and the ointment's sweet
for the fire in your head and feet
close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
think of nothing tonight
everything's all right, yes, everything's all right, yes
woman, your fine ointment brand-new and expensive
could have been saved for the poor
why has it been wasted
we could've raised maybe 300 silver pieces or more
people who are hungry, people who are starving
matter more than your feet and hair
try not to get worried
try not to turn on to
problems that upset you
Oh, don't you know
everything's all right, yes, everything's fine
and we want you to sleep well tonight
let the world turn without you tonight
if we try, we'll get by
so forget about us tonight
everything's all right, yes, everything's all right, yes
surely you're not saying we have the resources to save the poor from their lot
there will be poor always pathetically struggling
look at the good things you've got
think while you still have me
move while you still see me
you'll be lost and you'll be so sorry
when I'm gone
sleep and I shall soothe You
calm you and anoint You
myrrh for your hot forehead
Oh, then you'll feel
everything's all right, yes, everything's fine
and it's cool and the ointment's sweet
for the fire in your head and feet
close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
think of nothing tonight, close your eyes
close your eyes and relax, think of nothing tonight
close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
everything's all right, yes, everything
close your eyes and relax, think of nothing tonight
close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
think of nothing
everything's all right, yes, everything's all right, yes
close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
think of nothing
close your eyes and relax, think of nothing tonight

fools, you have no perception
the stakes we are gambling are frighteningly high
we must crush him completely
so like John before him, this Jesus must die
for the sake of the nation, this Jesus must die
must die, must die, this Jesus must die
so like John before him, this Jesus must die
must die, must die, this Jesus must, Jesus must

all that I knew
my poor Jerusalem
you see the truth
but you live a lie

while you live
your troubles are many
poor Jerusalem
to conquer death
you only have to die
you only have to
die
I dreamed I met a Galilean
a most amazing man
he had that look you very rarely find
the haunting hunted kind
I asked him to say
what had happened
how it all began
I asked again
he never said a word
as if he hadn't heard
and next the room
was full of wild and angry men
they seemed to hate this man
they fell on him and then
they disappeared again
then I saw thousands of millions
crying for this man
and then I heard them mentioning my name
and leaving me
the blame
the blame

try not to get worried
try not to turn on to problems that upset you
Oh, don't you know
everything's all right, yes, everything's fine
and I think I shall sleep well tonight
let the world turn without me tonight
close your eyes, close your eyes
and forget all about us
tonight
tonight
I don't know how to love him
what to do how to move him
I've been changed
Yes, really changed
in these past few days
when I've seen myself
I seem like someone else
I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me
he's a man
he's just a man
and I've had so many men before
in very many ways
he's just one more
should I bring him down
should I scream and shout
should I speak of love
let my feelings out
I never thought I'd come to this
what's it all about
don't you think
it's rather funny
I should be in this position
I'm the one who's always been so calm, so cool
no lover's fool
running every show
he scares me so
I never thought I'd come to this
what's it all about
yet, if he said he loved me
I'd be lost, I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope
just couldn't cope
I'd turn my head
I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know
he scares me so
I want him so
I
love him
so
now if I help you, it matters that you see
these sordid kind of things are coming hard to me
it's taken me some time to work out what to do
I weighed the whole thing out before I came to you
I have no thought at all about my own reward
I really didn't come here of my own accord
just don't say I'm damned for all time
I came because I had to I'm the one who saw Jesus can't control it like he did before
and, furthermore, I know that Jesus thinks so too
Jesus wouldn't mind that I was here with you
I have no thought at all about my own reward
I really didn't come here of my own accord
just don't say I'm damned for all time
annas, you're a friend, a worldly man and wise
Caiaphas, my friend, I know you sympathize
why are we the prophets, why am I the one
who sees the sad solution knows what must be done
I have no thought at all about my own reward
I really didn't come here of my own accord
just don't say I'm damned
for all, all time
cut the protesting, forget the excuses
we want information, get up off the floor
we have the papers
we need to arrest him
you know his movements, we know the law
your help in this matter won't go unrewarded
we'll pay you in silver cash on the nail
we just need to know where the soldiers can find him
with no crowd around him
then we can't fail
I don't need your blood money
Oh, that doesn't matter, our expenses are good
I don't want your blood money
but you might as well take it, we think that you should
think of the things you can do with that money
choose any charity, give to the poor
we've noted your motives, we've noted your feelings
this isn't blood money, it's a fee nothing
fee nothing, fee nothing more
on Thursday night
you'll find him
where you want him
far from the crowd
in the Garden of Gethsemane
well done, Judas
good old Judas
well done, Judas
good old Judas
look at all my trials and tribulations
sinking in a gentle pool of wine
don't disturb me now
I can see the answers
till this evening is this morning
life is fine
always hoped that I'd be an apostle
knew that I would make it if I tried
then when we retire
we can write the Gospels
so they'll still talk about us when we die
the end is just a little harder
when brought about by friends
for all you care
this wine
could be my blood
for all you care
this bread could be
my body
the end
this is my blood you drink
this is my body you eat
if you would remember me
when you eat and drink
I must be mad thinking I'd be remembered
Yes, I must be out of my head
look at your blank faces, my name will mean nothing, ten minutes after I'm dead
one of you denies me, one of you betrays me
but who'd wanna kill us now?
I don't know, but it's not safe out here.
so no word from Jon?
no.
well, listen...why don't you come stay with me?
Oh, no. That's sweet, but I wouldn't wanna impose.
Oh, no. No. Think of it as doing me a favor.
I wouldn't have to worry about you being out there.
okay.
Rorschach's journal, October 21 st, 1985.
on 43rd and 7th, saw Dreiberg and Jupiter leaving diner.
they didn't know me without my mask.
an affair?
did she break Manhattan's heart to engineer his exile...make room for Dreiberg?
does Manhattan even have a heart to break?
Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife named Roy Chess.
at his apartment, I found clues.
seems he worked at Pyramid Transnational.
I've seen the logo before at Moloch's.
someone tried to shoot the world's smartest man today, Moloch.
guy worked for Pyramid Transnational.
more than a just delivery service, I take it.
last time I was here, I saw a pension check written from the same company.
I'm guessing it's a front set up by whoever wants us masks dead.
now, no more lies, Moloch. Who runs Pyramid?
Rorschach.
this is the police. We know you're in there.
no. No!
if there's anybody in there with you, send them out unharmed.
no. No, no, no!
framed. Walked right into it. Stupid, stupid, stupid!
never, never surrender.
all right. I hope you're ready, hero.
when you are.
one...
...two...
...three.
come on.
son of a bitch.
Christ, he stinks. - Get that mask off him.
I got it. -No. No!
my face! Give me back my face!
the masked vigilante Rorschach was apprehended...
...and identified as Walter Kovacs, a 35-year-old white male.
little's known about Kovacs, but he was charged with the murder of Edgar Jacobi, found shot in the head in his home in the Bronx.
police officers were injured and Jacobi's home was set ablaze during the violent course of the capture.
Rorschach!
I'm gonna fuck you like I fucked your mother!
come on out, Rorschach!
Walter Kovacs.
is that your name? Walter?
well, let me explain your situation here, Walter.
you cooperate with me...
...and I may be able to convince them that you should be treated medically.
in a hospital. I believe that would be good for you.
but the authorities wanna put you with the general population.
prison's a prison. -Uh-huh. Yes.
but the difference is, down there...
...you'd be eaten alive.
you're responsible for a lot of them being in prison here, Walter.
tell me what you see.
a pretty butterfly.
what about now? What do you see here?
mom?
is he hurting you?
you got a fucking kid in here. I get that at home.
bastard. I should have had that abortion.
some nice flowers.
I heard this guy's mom's a whore.
did you catch any diseases from her?
huh? Whoreson. Listen to me, retard.
Hey, you think she'd suck my dick for a dollar?
clouds.
tell me about Rorschach. Will you do that, Walter?
you keep calling me Walter. I don't like you.
you don't like me. All right, why is that, exactly?
you're fat.
wealthy. Liberal sensibilities.
you wanna know about Rorschach?
I'll tell you about Rorschach.
I was investigating a kidnap case.
blaire Roche.
six-year-old girl. I was young then.
too soft on criminals.
I let them live.
broke a man's arm to get a tip. Led me to the missing girl's location.
I knew the girl was here...
...but when I searched the place, I saw nothing.
and then I found her.
it was dark when the murderer got back.
as dark as it gets.
Oh, God. Who's out there? Who is it?
who is it?
what? What the fuck? Who the fuck are you?
what the fuck do you want? You killed my dogs, man!
you think I had something to do with that girl? I found that.
what evidence have you got? That's nothing.
okay. I confess.
I kidnapped her. I killed her.
arrest me.
what? Arrest me!
I did it! I said I did it!
Christ.
look, I've got a problem, man. Fucking take me in. I need help.
no, don't. Don't do that. Take me in. Don't! No!
men get arrested.
dogs get put down.
tremors of impact shook my arm.
warm blood splashed my face.
whatever was left of Walter Kovacs died that night with that little girl.
from then on, there was only Rorschach.
see, doctor, God didn't kill that little girl.
fate didn't butcher her and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs.
if God saw what any of us did that night, he didn't seem to mind.
from then on, I knew:
God doesn't make the world this way.
we do.
Hey, Rorschach.
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?
rorschach, I heard your mother was a whore.
Hey, you know what? I'm pretty famous too.
ain't that right? That's right. That's right.
maybe I can give you an autograph. What you say, big boy?
none of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you.
all right, that's it!
you're locked in here with me.
Laurie!
shit.
hold on. -Fuck.
I got it, I got it, I got it.
I'm so sorry. I was snooping and must have hit the wrong button.
are you hurt? -No, no.
okay. -I'm fine. I just feel so bad.
no, don't worry.
it's happened before. Comedian did it back in '77.
Archie survived that.
Archie?
Oh. Well, uh, short for Archimedes...
...Merlin's pet owl.
stupid nickname.
how did you ever afford all this stuff, anyway?
well, my dad was in corporate banking and left me a lot of money when he died...
...which always surprised me. I mean, he was...
I think he was disappointed I went into crime fighting instead of following him.
guess I was just more interested in birds and airplanes, mythology and...
must be nice having a secret identity.
a secret place that nobody knows about.
you can just come down here and hang out without anyone checking up on you.
nobody watching you.
wanna try those on?
there we go.
wow, these rock.
they amplify the spectral range.
thermal imaging.
they work even better in the dark.
you can see me, right?
I can see everything.
I remember, no matter how black it got, whenever I looked through those goggles, everything was as clear as day.
this must be the way Jon sees the world.
we should probably head up. Food's getting cold.
put those away when you're done.
Soviets are finding themselves bogged down in bloody house-to-house fighting.
casualties on both sides are said to be in the hundreds.
civilian deaths are also alarmingly high.
Dan.
jon sees a lot of things...but he doesn't see me.
well, uh...
Oh.
sorry.
come here.
what's the matter?
if you could just move a little... -Okay.
Yeah. There you go.
soviet ambassador to the U. N. had no comment when asked if Dr. Manhattan's disappearance has fueled Soviet aggression in Afghanistan.
Dan, what's wrong?
sorry, I...
Yeah, I just need a couple minutes.
Oh, hell.
it's been a long time, Rorschach.
big Figure.
small world.
I like that.
but you know, it is a small world in here.
and I've been in it for, how long now, Lloyd?
almost 15 years, Mr. Figure.
that's right.
fifteen years since you and that Owl fella put me away.
so...
...Rorschach, that guy you burned is dying. Could go any minute.
you know, by my count, there are more than 50 people in here that you put away.
I been talking to every one of them and they're all dying to get a piece of you.
this place is gonna explode!
then, you die by inches.
tall order.
I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole.
relax, Lawrence. Soon.
come on.
Dan?
is everything all right?
I'm tired of being afraid.
afraid of war...
...afraid of the mask killer......and afraid of this goddamn suit...
...and how much I need it.
me too.
so to hell with it.
let's take Archie out.
you're serious.
I used to be a masked avenger too, remember?
I'm used to going out at 3 in the morning and doing something stupid.
rapid burner. Be advised, all units.
tenement fire at 5th and Grand. Rapid burner.
let's go.
I can see it. All right, hold on.
Dan, there are kids in there.
everyone, stay where you are and remain calm.
we're gonna get you out of there.
the roof's starting to cave. Get me in there.
I'm gonna get you close.
let's go.
watch your step. All right.
we're all set.
is that everyone?
Bye. Bye!
I can't believe we did that.
they'll lock us up with Rorschach. - Who cares?
world War llI could start tomorrow.
right?
right.
come back here!
he's dead, Rorschach.
while everyone's distracted, we thought we'd bring you a housewarming gift.
something from the machine shop.
Hey, boss, you notice?
none of that "small world, tall order" crap.
he knows once we slice open his lock, he's next on the block.
fat chance.
you're dead, Rorschach!
we got a prison full of killers out here. What do you got?
your hands, my pleasure.
can't reach the lock. Should I cut the bars?
this riot won't last. I been waiting 15 years for this.
I'm sorry, Lawrence, but you're in the way of my revenge.
nothing personal, big guy.
boss! Wait!
now you find out what the score is.
One-nothing. Come and get me.
come on.
so I've been thinking.
I feel that we have an obligation to our fraternity. - I think we ought to spring Rorschach. What?
someone set him up.
and this whole cancer thing with Jon, it just doesn't make sense.
you didn't get it.
Yeah, but breaking into a maximum-security prison...
...is a little different than putting out a fire. -Yeah, you're right.
it'll be more fun.
hurry, Lloyd. I wanna smell this son of a bitch cooking.
Yes.
no.
never disposed of sewage with a toilet before. Obvious, really.
Two-nothing. Your move.
get out of the way!
no. No.
Where's my face?
don't kill me.
your turn, doctor.
tell me, what do you see?
don't move!
Rorschach.
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.
excuse me. Have to visit men's room.
Oh, for chris sake.
are you all right?
Yeah. Just...
...heavy, you know?
war, jail break.
don't worry about it. Okay? Everything's gonna be fine.
Hello, Laurie. -Jon.
TV said you were on Mars. - I am on Mars.
you and I are about to have a conversation there.
what are you talking about?
you're going to try to convince me to save the world.
Laurie, don't. - Dan, trust me.
I have to go.
beautiful, isn't it?
forgive me. These things sometimes slip my mind.
it won't happen again.
that's comforting.
Oh, my God.
I'm on Mars.
we need to hit up underworld contacts, squeeze people.
sure, why don't we just pick names out of a phone book?
you forgot how we do things, Daniel.
you've gone too soft. Too trusting. Especially with women.
okay, no. Listen, I've had it with that.
God, who do you think you are, Rorschach?
you live off people while insulting them...
...and no one complains because they think you're a goddamn lunatic.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that, man.
Daniel...you are a good friend.
I know it can be difficult with me sometimes.
forget it.
it's okay, man.
let's do it your way.
Oh, God.
pyramid Transnational. Anyone heard of it?
Oh, you bastards.
I buy everyone a round and you sell me out like this?
back off, or I'll stick this glass in your squidgy face.
everybody stay calm. We'll try to keep this brief.
Roy Chess. On Pyramid payroll.
tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Dead now. Did you know him?
no.
Yeah, yeah!
I hired him. I knew him from the inside. -You're a felon.
I was. I've been straight ever since I got out, I swear.
I barely knew Chess that well, but I was told to hire from the old life.
told by whom? -My contact, Miss Slater.
Janey Slater works for Pyramid too?
Yeah, she was real nice. She said hiring ex-cons was part of the company program.
give people a second chance. God, please let go! I'm telling the truth!
Janey Slater, Manhattan's old girlfriend.
Adrian might help us find out who's underwriting Pyramid.
follow the money.
this is where we hold our conversation.
in it, you ask me to stop the imminent nuclear war.
but why would I save a world I no longer have any stake in?
then do it for me.
if you really care.
when you left me, I left Earth.
does that not show you that I care?
my red world here, now...means more to me than your blue one.
let me show you.
bombers are fueled and ready, sir.
it's time, gentlemen.
take us to DEFCON one.
not in penthouse. Not in office.
what nocturnal proclivities entice a man with everything out into the night at this hour?
I'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary.
maybe he keeps on file.
something's not right. -Agreed.
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess all work for Pyramid.
Moloch said the Comedian mentioned list with his and Slater's name on it.
whoever owns Pyramid could be giving these people cancer.
setting Manhattan up.
funny.
ancient pharaohs looked forward to the end of the world.
believed cadavers would rise, reclaim hearts from golden jars.
must currently be holding breath in anticipation.
Pharaohs?
got a psych profile on Manhattan.
see what the corporate head-peepers say.
subject continues to retreat emotionally.
if the only remaining ties were to be severed...
...we predict total detachment from the human condition."
I'm in.
no.
congratulations, Mr. Veidt. Dr. Manhattan's energy reactor is online.
your support and your enthusiasm is what has led to this triumph.
on behalf of the research team, we salute you.
Cheers. - Cheers.
what in life does not deserve celebrating?
this is the new Karnak.
this represents the culmination of a dream more than 2000 years old...
...a dream now assured because of your unquestioning assistance.
and for this...I am ashamed...
...ashamed that you must now share such inadequate a reward.
to the pharaohs...
...their greatest secrets entrusted to their servants buried alive with them in sand-floored chambers.
sleep well, gentlemen.
our new, peaceful world will be indebted to your great sacrifice.
Bubastis.
Rorschach's journal. Final entry.
Veidt's behind everything.
Why?
what's his endgame?
I cannot imagine a more dangerous opponent.
used to joke he was fast enough to catch a bullet.
he could kill us both alone in the snow.
that's where we're going now: Antarctica.
whether I'm alive or dead upon this reading...
...I hope the world survives long enough for this journal to reach you.
I live my life free of compromise...and step into the shadow without complaint or regret.
rorschach, November 1 st.
can't you just tell me how this ends and save us the trouble?
it ends with you in tears.
tears? So you don't come back to Earth.
at some point, yes.
the streets are filled with death.
Jon, please.
you have to stop this. Everyone will die.
and the universe will not even notice.
in my opinion, the existence of life...
...is a highly overrated phenomenon.
just look around you.
mars gets along perfectly well without so much as a microorganism.
here, it's a constantly changing topographical map...
...flowing and shifting around the pole in ripples 10, 000 years wide.
so tell me...
...how would all of this be greatly improved by an oil pipeline?
by a shopping mall?
so it's too much to ask for a miracle?
miracles, by their definition, are meaningless.
Oh, God, Jon!
only what can happen does happen. - Just stop your bullshit.
land this thing. Now.
as you wish.
you know what?
you can send me back to Earth to fry with Dan and my mom...
...and all the other worthless humans.
but know that you were wrong. You said this ended with me in tears...
...and look: nothing. Maybe you were wrong about everything.
you complain that I refuse to see life on life's terms...
...yet you continuously refuse to see things from my perspective.
you shut out what you're afraid of. - I'm not afraid.
you want me to see things your way? Go ahead, show me. Do that thing you do.
magic. Dreams. That is what I had before. I was a hero, goddamn it!
it's not my fault you got old. What do you have to complain about?
I put food on the table for you and your child.
call your friend Eddie. Maybe he can give you a better life.
even the grimy parts of it...keep on getting brighter.
you're Sally Jupiter's kid.
you're the Comedian, right?
you were pretty cool in there.
you know, your mom, she was one of the all-time champion beauties.
you got her eyes, you know. You got... - Take your hands off her.
Hey, doll. Long time no see.
not long enough in my book, Eddie. Get in the car.
now.
are there no depths you won't sink to?
Jesus Christ, Sally. Can't a guy talk to his, you know, old friend's daughter?
drive.
it was a mistake. One time.
guy tries to rape you, and years later, you let him finish the job?
what? Were you drunk or just lonely?
am I ever gonna live this down?
Laurie.
no.
no, not him.
the Comedian...was your father.
no.
No! No! No!
my life is just...one big joke.
I don't think your life is a joke.
Yeah, well...
...I'm sorry if I don't trust your sense of humor.
will you smile if I admit I was wrong?
about what?
miracles.
events with astronomical odds of occurring...
...like oxygen turning into gold.
I've longed to witness such an event, and yet I neglect...
...that in human coupling millions upon millions of cells compete to create life for generation after generation...
...until finally, your mother...loves a man...
...Edward Blake, the Comedian, a man she has every reason to hate...
...and out of that contradiction, against unfathomable odds...
...It's you...
only...
...you...
...that emerged.
to distill so specific a form from all that chaos is like turning air into gold.
a miracle.
and so I was wrong.
now dry your eyes, and let's go home.
we got a bearing on that artificial structure. Heat signature's off the charts.
Veidt. - I don't like the way Archie's kicking.
the engines. - They're icing up. Hold onto something.
Daniel, you're coming in too low.
don't wish to interfere, but perhaps should pull up sharply...
I know! I'm trying. I'm trying to pull him up, goddamn it!
I'm gonna redirect the heat from the flamethrower to speed up deicing...
...but it's gonna take a while and we don't have time to wait.
you need something warmer.
fine like this.
what is it, girl?
Mm.
Adrian's a pacifist.
he's a vegetarian, for chrissakes. He's never killed anyone in his life.
Hitler was vegetarian.
you're squeamish, leave him to me. We won't get second chance.
gentlemen.
welcome. - Adrian, we know everything.
then what's there to discuss, Dan?
plenty. You killed Comedian.
may he rest in peace.
Blake figured it out first.
Nixon had him keeping tabs on us, making sure we weren't rocking the boat.
Blake found out what I was doing here in Karnak...
...and by the time he visited poor Moloch, he was cracking badly.
even I couldn't predict he'd be the one to have a change of heart.
so...I had to kill him.
then I neutralized Jon. No easy task.
I put roughly $2 billion into tachyon research...
...to block Jon's vision of the future.
you used his psych profile to manipulate him.
got him to leave the planet.
I've known Jon long enough to see he isn't devoid of emotion.
his subtle facial twitches wouldn't be noticed by the layman, but to me...
...he might as well have been sobbing.
all I needed to do was tug on the thread.
the sudden flood of emotion Jon felt when he came to believe he'd given cancer to the people he loved...
...was all the excuse he needed to leave Earth.
your bullshit assassin. You paid him to throw us off.
Mr. Chess gave his life in the service of a higher cause, Dan.
I put a cyanide capsule in his mouth...
...leaving only one loose end:
you, and your mask-killer theory...
...one you followed with the tenacity of a true sociopath.
I tipped off the police.
once you were in prison, I was able to move forward.
sorry to disappoint you.
we were supposed to make the world a better place.
Dan, that's exactly what I am doing.
nuclear war?
human extinction?
of course, my moral safeguards gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice.
a few key regions around the globe...
new York, Los Angeles, Moscow, Hong Kong.
disintegrated in an instant.
fifteen million people killed by Dr. Manhattan himself.
the world's punishment for flirting with World War III.
jon wouldn't do that.
a fact no one outside this room ever has to know.
the energy breakthrough I was working on just came to fruition.
all these years, Jon was helping me replicate his power...
...unaware of how I planned to use it.
you see...
...the Comedian was right.
humanity's savage nature will inevitably lead to global annihilation.
so in order to save this planet...
...I had to trick it with the greatest practical joke in human history.
killing millions. -To save billions.
a necessary crime.
you know, we can't let you do that.
"do that," Rorschach?
I'm not a comic-book villain.
do you think I'd explain my masterstroke to you...
...if there were even the slightest possibility you could affect the outcome?
I triggered it 35 minutes ago.
Jesus Christ, Henry.
why the hell didn't we get a launch detection?
it's not the Soviets, sir.
intel indicates the energy signature was generated by Dr. Manhattan.
Jon.
interference.
cataclysmic interference.
I can't believe it happened.
this wasn't caused by nuclear warheads.
it was me.
I...did this.
what do you mean, you did this? - Not directly.
it was made to look like I did it.
Adrian.
speak of the devil.
Jon. - I know.
must stop him. Killed Blake, killed millions.
wait here.
Adrian, stop this.
the tachyons were clever...
...but even if I can't predict where you are, I can turn the walls to glass.
I should thank you.
I'd almost forgotten the excitement of not knowing the delights of uncertainty.
forgive me, girl.
you're such an asshole.
Veidt, you bastard.
if you've hurt her, I'Il... -Dan...
...grow up. My new world demands less obvious heroism.
your...
...schoolboy heroics are redundant. What have they achieved?
failing to prevent Earth's salvation...
...is your only triumph.
I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.
I'm very disappointed.
reassembling myself was the first trick I learned.
it didn't kill Osterman.
did you really think it would kill me?
I have walked across the surface of the sun.
I have witnessed events so tiny and so fast...
...they can hardly be said to have occurred at all...
...but you, Adrian, you're just a man.
the world's smartest man poses no more threat to me than does its smartest termite.
what's that?
another ultimate weapon?
Yes.
you could say that.
came under attack.
millions of lives were suddenly ended in an act of evil perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself.
since the attacks, I have been in constant contact with the premier of the U. S.S. R.
putting aside our past differences...
...we have both pledged to unite...
...against this common enemy.
with the rest of the world...
...we will prevail.
this is a day we shall never forget.
and yet we go forward to defend the human race...
...and all that is good and just in our world.
thank you. God bless us all.
do you see?
two superpowers retreating from war.
I've saved the earth from hell.
we both have.
this is as much your victory as it is mine.
now we can return...
...do what we were meant to.
we were meant to exact justice.
everyone's gonna know what you've done. - Will they?
by exposing me, you would sacrifice the peace so many died for today.
peace based on a lie. - But peace...
...nonetheless. - He's right.
exposing Adrian would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again.
no. We can't do this.
on Mars...
...you taught me the value of life.
if we hope to preserve it here...
...we must remain silent.
keep your own secrets.
don't even think about it.
Rorschach.
wait.
never compromise.
not even in the face of Armageddon.
that's always been the difference between us, Daniel.
I've made myself feel every death...
...see every innocent face I've murdered to save humanity.
you understand, don't you? Without condoning...or condemning...
...I understand.
out of my way. People have to be told.
you know I can't let you do that.
suddenly you discover humanity?
convenient.
if you'd cared from the start, none of this would have happened.
I can change almost anything...
...but I can't change human nature.
of course you must protect Veidt's new utopia.
what's one more body amongst foundations?
well, what are you waiting for?
do it.
do it!
No!
I'm leaving this galaxy for one a little less complicated.
I thought you said you cared about life again.
I do.
I think maybe I'll create some.
goodbye, Laurie.
come on.
come on!
Dan...
...a world united and at peace,
there had to be sacrifice.
No! You haven't idealized mankind, you've deformed it.
you've mutilated it.
that's your legacy.
that's the real practical joke.
we repeat, there is nothing wrong with your television set.
you are about to participate in a great adventure.
you are about to experience the awe and mystery...
...which reaches from the inner mind to the outer limits.
sure you don't want a drink?
I'm okay.
Cheers.
there's something I need to get off my chest.
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.
Laurel.
what you must think of me.
I'm sorry I never told you.
I should have...
...but I don't know, I just felt ashamed. I felt stupid.
it doesn't matter.
people's lives take them strange places. They do strange things...
...and, well, sometimes they can't talk about them.
I know how that is...
...but I just want you to know...
...that you never did anything wrong by me.
you asked me why I wasn't mad at him.
because he gave me you.
Thanks, Mom.
I love you.
Hello, Miss Jupiter. - Oh, Sally, please.
excuse me. Gotta go freshen up. I'll be right back.
so how's it going up here? - Good. How's it going down there?
good. I think I've got everything working.
all of Archie's systems are upgraded. Finished the tinkering for now...
...so all we gotta do is take her out.
well, that sounds like a date.
are we gonna be all right?
long as people think Jon's still watching us, we'll be all right in the end.
I know what Jon would say:
nothing ends.
nothing ever ends.
seymour, we got nothing to write about anymore.
everyone in the country...
...every country in the world are holding hands...
...and singing songs about peace and love.
it's like living in a goddamn global hippie commune.
well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna be running for president in '88.
we could run a piece on that.
seymour, we don't dignify absurdities with coverage.
this is still America, damn it. Who wants a cowboy in the White House?
okay. I could look for something in the crank file.
crank file.
whatever. Take some initiative.
run whatever you like. I leave it entirely in your hands.
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.
tonight, a comedian died in New York.
some day yesterday, Cass.
yesterday was a three-ring circus.
I'm going to be with my father today.
my father has more big and huge for me.
without the zeros and ones, Cass, big and huge won't mean dick.
work here.
Two-stop bus ride, Dwayne, from lurking outside the door to fucking turning into a full-blown homo.
can I come in?
no, stay the fuck outside.
still brooming the spider webs off our website?
1244 hits.
1244 hits in, like, 24 hours.
no shit.
it's the halo effect from Shaun.
far out.
bottom line, I think Shaun needs his own site.
well, he's already on mytube, or whatever the fuck you call it.
a site, Butchie, commercial portal capacity, like five years ahead of the curve I thought to put in yours and you never fucking exploited.
you think that's where it all went wrong.
me not exploiting my portal capacity?
no, I'm not talking about you at all, Butchie.
I'm just saying, if Shaun doesn't do it, whoever sponsors him will, and he'll end up getting used like some street whore.
does any of that sound familiar to you?
I guess that makes sense.
well, you ought to go talk to him, and now's a good time 'cause Mitch is at the restoration center.
or whatever the fuck he's doing in Mexico.
I don't suppose you'd like to come with me.
Nah, I got a butt plug exploiting my portal.
what the fuck am I gonna say to him, Dwayne?
Yeah, okay.
in case he doesn't understand how I talk was all.
fuck, I used to work at the U. N. Baby.
now I'll have to cancel my many previous engagements.
Yeah, I'll have to cancel all of mine too.
that's right.
where are we looking? I'll meet you.
some gangbanger will hit you upside the head and I'll have to collect you with a spoon and blotter.
so don't even try to live green?
you got it, my brother.
Hey, Janie.
good or bad?
good.
everything's good.
good enough to get his boards out of storage?
that's why I'm here.
see that?
imperial beach, who's been here before?
a funky little beach town, a lot of history for our sport.
now...
Oh, my friend, spread that food around.
if you see any hungry conventioneers coming through here, feed them.
fires? - No fires, learning opportunities.
wonder boy...
e-commerce bitchfest.
tremendous learning opportunities.
we're rolling out those P.O.P. Incentives.
which you think is money pissed away.
a wise man once told me that "core shops are Stinkweed's soul.
did you believe him?
we upped the incentives to 4%.
year-to-date, domestic's nearly level, down 3% ...
within the parameters of plan.
international's 14 above plan.
eastern Europe's a minor disappointment.
china's on plan.
stalemate on that trademark headache.
latin America stays a pleasant surprise.
the Brazilians have a boner for our shoes.
Really?
you got a boner?
let me check.
break.
they start wearing suits or we do.
what happened in Huntington, Jake?
I thought that's what we'd be talking about in there.
I thought we would have talked about it before we went in there.
I don't know, dude, the fucking traffic, you know?
at Huntington, Shaun Yost won.
he wiped out and hurt himself at the end of the heat.
the doctor was wrong how bad.
I was there when they brought him out of the water.
he was drowned.
he broke his neck.
how is he alive?
a miracle?
I agreed he could be the next one.
all the family downside.
I agreed we'd go after him hard.
a miracle...half our base runs the other way.
do we make that up selling at shrines?
I'm here to try to figure that out.
and I'm your hire, Linc.
I'm supposed to tell you when people aren't happy.
some people never are.
tell them to go fuck themselves.
Yeah, I thought I wouldn't do that till after they bought us out.
let's go deal with these clones.
can I hang a couple days?
I get you to Tijuana, the kid can hear our confession.
lucky coincidence.
are we happy, wonder boy, when domestic sales are level?
level is on plan for the quarter.
wait a second, treading water is getting ready to drown.
the salmon makes me thirsty.
get a drink.
level's on plan 'cause domestic's a maturing market.
and do we suppose that domestics have matured due to e-commerce?
I don't know how you'd measure correlation.
we don't have an M. C. Paradigm?
no.
so what will you do, grab your balls and guess?
did I do something to piss you off?
eat your buffet. - I'd like to sit down.
go ahead.
you call that sitting down?
I want to go back to the table.
this is why I hired wonder boy...he just comes right from his fucking gut.
what are we doing here, Linc?
I'm not 100% clear.
maybe you'd like to google it and find out.
if this is a referendum on information technology, our target demographic's for it.
Oh, so that ship has sailed?
the best we can do is hope to jump on board?
does that summarize your position?
if you're treading water, you're getting ready to drown.
if I'm treading water, fuckface.
I am not swimming toward a ship that has set sail and begging them to pull me in their dinghy.
if I got a surfboard beside me, I'm getting on that fucker and I'm paddling out, turning around and flipping the bird to all the assholes on that ship.
and maybe 3% of them weren't sure they ever wanted to be on that boat to begin with.
some of them...they're diving off.
now them... them.
I give them a big fucking smile.
I ride up to them on my board and say, "hey, how would you like to buy one just like it?
or my jockstrap, or my boardshorts, wetsuit, ski jacket, snowboard that I always take with me when I'm surfing?
I am such a tremendous boardshort-wetsuit-ski-jacket-snowboard ripper.
what I'm not is a fucking asshole with allergies trapped on a boat or jerking off to the internet like 97% of my target demographic.
and the upside for me is, I like being on the water.
so if you're not too salty from your salmon, maybe I can interest you in a little ham.
give me a fucking break.
okay, we're done.
I'll be in Imperial beach till further notice.
I'll tell you something else:
that kid was saved by a miracle.
what room is she in? - 244.
Yeah, it's your wife, Mitch,
well, if you're not dead, just a quick message to go fuck yourself for not checking in to say you're all right.
and have loads of fun on whatever beach or whatever astral plane you're on.
Hi.
use the cafe across the street.
excuse me?
our toilets are for employees.
go across the street.
my question, or my desire, was how long has that ink store been open?
we don't sell bongs.
we don't sell incense or rolling papers.
a good reputation, that Pete, hmm?
no fatalities?
we're not a walk-in clinic.
the salamander was highly valued in certain...extinct island tribes.
God damn it!
my name is Mark Lewinsky.
I'm an attorney.
is this some slip-and-fall bullshit?
hardly, madam.
am I pointing at my neck?
is it painfully swollen and inflamed?
it's red.
tattoo, a tribute to my employer, possibly... fatal.
I am a counsel for mercy hospital, the place that saved your grandson's life, and I just need one signature to close Shaun's file.
all right, give me a pen.
certainly.
merest of formalities departure against medical advice.
here I go.
take off.
you won't have to ask me twice.
get out.
you're giving me a bad fucking feeling.
can't we at least accomplish our little bit of wrist business here?
get out of my store or you're gonna get kicked in the balls.
fine.
ma, is that you?
shut up.
they sent me home, ma.
principal sent me home.
strange way to show your appreciation, Mrs. Yost, to the hospital that saved your grandson.
bill's bird saved my grandson.
and I'm showing this form to Meyer Dickstein.
Oh yeah, the Errol Flynn look-alike on the back cover of the yellow pages.
Oh, you sure you wanna go there, Frank Enstein?
Oh...you got anybody I could call?
no, I can boil my own toast.
yeah?
I'm a friend of Linc Stark'S.
And?
and I work for him.
I'm vice president of his company,
what do you want from me?
Linc's having some sort of midlife crisis.
and you're here to help him through it?
10: 30 in the morning, no wonder they're going broke.
Hey, where is everyone?
she opened up and then she split with some little guy in her car.
what's going on, Shaunie?
nothing.
the shop's locked up.
put the joint out.
you know Dwayne?
how's it going? - How's it going, Shaun?
Dwayne wants to talk to you about some informational superhighway shit.
could we do it another time?
give us a second, Dwayne.
we can do it another time.
stand by the bicycles.
Hey, what's the matter with talking to him now?
I don't feel like it.
don't give me that smart look when you're sitting here smoking when someone wants to help you.
that guy from Stinkweed wanted to help.
you wouldn't let me sign with him.
the fuck if I wouldn't.
who told you that?
I haven't seen Linc Stark since you got hurt, Shaun.
it's been a busy couple of days.
so are you saying I can sign with them?
little weed on your brain, you get a real smart ass tone of voice going.
that guy looks like a tool.
that's just great, Shaunie.
hurt a person's feelings comes looking to help you.
I didn't say it so he could hear.
why don't you just leave me alone?
Yeah, good, great, fine, okay?
if I see Linc Stark,
I'll tell him to come sign you.
Oh yeah, I forgot, you signed me over to gram and gramps.
tell him to go talk to them.
Yeah, good. Let me get away.
me being a fuck-up doesn't mean I shouldn't try to give you good advice.
is my mom staying in I. B?
I don't know.
maybe you could give her some good advice and ask her to stay.
he'll be all right.
Yeah, looks like he's doing great.
that little pisspot.
so what should we do now?
well, Dwayne,
I guess you're gonna get your dipshit scooter out of my van.
Yeah, we can work this out later.
and I'm gonna get good and fucking high.
where are you, Kai?
the shop's locked.
Shaunie's out back smoking weed.
find a fucking shorter jingle!
inroom service?
a really good friend of yours wants to pay me ton your life.
doesn't work.
doesn't work either.
is it chilly in here, ma?
he's burning up...
maybe from your hot garlic breath.
why don't you get out of the line of fire?
well, twist my fucking arm.
boss, purple salamander, honoring a certain someone.
if yours hadn't have come out green,
I'd be having mine burned off as to not get us took for the bobbsey twins.
I was poisoned and miscolored?
right up here.
excuse me.
okay, we have docked.
is that the torturing murderer that casted my wrist?
it's me, Palaka.
I am fucked up, doc, to a fare-thee-well.
Hey, thank god me and you became friends, huh?
Yeah.
what does he need? I'll run to the pharmacy.
let's get him examined first.
when did you get that tattoo, Palaka?
today, yeah.
when did he get this?
he told you-- today.
Yeah, I'm asking when.
he came in my store, like, an hour ago, said he'd just got inked.
we're gonna need to get some antibiotics into you, Palaka.
won't be the first time, doc.
I been batting clean-up since little league.
we're gonna need more room.
here, come here.
come on. - This wall does need to come out.
come on.
get out of the way. - Put him in my room.
I have an account around the corner.
Cvs? - I'm happy to get that filled.
no, he needs an I. V. and a few other things.
I want to see what they have stocked.
you thinking of going anytime soon?
I understand you're concerned.
I'm not concerned.
I'll tell you what I'm fucking concerned.
nice working with you.
just shut your mouth, okay?
you're going to be fine.
Thanks, ma.
hello.
Hello, come in.
just miss me in time.
birds see.
can I have you Soda?
Twinkies.
no, thanks.
I see.
birds are good.
okay.
Hey, okay.
okay, goodness sakes.
no, I can't say.
and I would understand it anyway.
what does Mitch think?
Mitch is maintaining radio silence.
hello.
how are you?
why would they want me to sign that?
she's already shown it to me.
BUTCHIE is fucking Kai's brains out.
good.
not there anyone comes in.
she's never fucking work.
SHAUNIE could spending time with her.
his buddy still tease him after the accident?
this is a boiler plate for you.
the doctor's the sacrificial lam.
typically.
but ... actions against the doctor.
going on and on about what he's talking about.
sits there everyday, Dickstein, pretending to make a life out of maintaining Butchie's website, and he's so excited how Shaunie's accident effect his, halo effect, whatever the fuck all about?
I'm afraid to let them on the street on that stupid scootery, fucking drives.
then number of hits on Butchie's site, the halo effect.
what the fuck was I just saying?
43 days in...
82 days in...for you.
I got...for you, Doris.
don't let anything happen to that doctor.
that may not be in our hands.
how do you live in here?
thank you.
I'll use this ... in case what you got is transferrable.
I'll bring in fresh sheets.
stop answering if I'm talking to him.
know you fucking die.
you tell me your name, where you live and you marital status.
Tina Blake,...single.
California? - Right.
do you have any children, Tina?
one.
I gave him away the day he was born.
and do you know who Shaun's father was?
Yeah, I fucking know who his father is.
I left Shaunie with Butchie's parents.
and what do you do for a living?
adult film actress.
do you know Linc Stark?
Yes.
how did you meet him?
he picked me up.
and do you have a contractual arrangement with Linc Stark involving your son Shaun Yost?
he's offered me a contractual arrangement.
what are the terms?
$4, 000 a month for Shaun's under contract.
distinctly? - Yeah.
have you have sexual relations with Linc Stark?
I'm not going to talk about that.
have you ever been arrested?
Yes.
what was your charge?
extortion.
and did that involve blackmail?
I was quitted.
I bet that had a big relation ... - Are we done?
can be.
ever do drugs with Linc?
are you asking me to fib?
are you asking me to write you another check?
car is blue red.
I mean if he was really sick, you take him to the hospital, right?
I'm trying to remember, how I practiced before I met you.
was it without a fractured skull?
some of the ice is yellow with rust from the machine.
it's all right. - We don't have to use it.
the yellow is segregated in the silver pail.
just dump it all in the tub.
Now...a little pin stick.
Oh, christ.
how's our patient?
it's a holding action.
we have to let the antibiotics kick in.
was that all overdone about cigarettes?
no.
in any case, I now have some sense how the great astaire felt the day he put on tap shoes.
well, they're always looking for candy stripers.
Yeah.
what? You're shitting me.
could I get one of those thimblefuls?
Yes, Ramon.
orange juice?
no, thanks.
or, well, yes.
thank you.
excuse me.
please, Ramon, have another.
and know that I do not rise to your taunt about my cups because I am all nurse.
Butchie's about to get caught wrong.
isn't he alone in there?
got your message, shortened my jingle.
couldn't find Shaunie.
I copped. I didn't use.
I didn't want to use.
I think it's off me.
give me a break.
is it sound judgment, Palaka, treating you here, or fear of humiliation?
resigning my position to shield that boy.
grand self-sacrificial gesture-- that was one thing.
I'll go weeks without selling a sherbet.
not much grandeur for me steering you into the E. R.
like some defrocked storefront operator waiting hat-in-hand for a resident to decide to admit you.
I pray to god that's not what holds me back.
now now, ma.
let me avoid this lady's tone of voice.
have you seen Meyer Dickstein?
no, ma'am.
he hasn't arrived yet.
are they fucking in there?
hard to say.
what an hour has wrought.
water, sand and mud when you delivered our patient, now about to become concrete.
how is that guy?
well, we are waiting for the antibiotics to kick in.
are they fucking in there?
the merest beginning of our renovation.
I'm looking for Meyer Dickstein.
Yes, well, I haven't seen him.
I saw you out in the water this morning.
yeah?
I got your boards outside.
every call I make, afterwards I gotta use cuticle scissors.
it's Butchie. Leave a message.
message from bill jacks.
Shaunie's over here with me, so you may wanna call or just, you know, get over here.
voicemail. Not there.
now...
here's a book that deals with anniversaries of people who are dead.
you see?
there's various chapters, helping the bereaved be at ease.
now what in god's name this has to do with you
13 years old?
14 years of age.
and thank god you've lost no one to feel grief over the anniversary of.
now...
I'd like to say this:
people are sad for various reasons and sometimes an outside source is required even to help them know they feel sad...
or if they know, then offer helpful hints and suggestions, ways to deal with the problem, which is why I showed you the book.
can I be Frank with you?
sure, Bill.
you reek of marijuana smoke.
I smoked a joint today.
and you tell me that without shyness or remorse.
that doctor is about to get an ass-fucking from his hospital.
Hey, Cissy.
Yeah, good to see you.
I remember when we used to meet at work.
I feel like a duck at as shooting gallery.
Hey, ma.
hid 'em before I could sell 'em.
Shaunie's over here with me, so you may wanna call or just, you know, get over here.
it's Bill. Shaun's there.
I may take a ride over there.
did you tell the doctor?
no.
go ahead.
about the ass-fucking?
don't do nothing stupid, doc.
no, he needs to be in that ice bath.
if that's what he needs, then the regular doctors will ice him at the fucking hospital.
I am a regular doctor, and these are just the several hours that your friend shouldn't be subjected to the disruptions involved in being admitted to a hospital to resume treatment he's already getting.
fuck you. Open the fucking door.
Oh, another county heard from.
you're... fucking lucky I got my hands full.
take him back inside.
Thanksgiving. Make a wish.
all your smartass fucking talk, it was me that broke his fucking wrist.
it was a dirty needle got your friend sick, not a broken wrist.
stop trying to force an outcome 'cause you're upset for your friend.
quick review--how to put people at their ease?
I'm good.
upstairs.
talk amongst yourselves.
Twinkies, soda and the like.
Hey, dad. - Hey, Shaunie.
Where's Bill?
he went upstairs.
Oh, right.
you can go ahead and sit down, dad.
pretty pissed?
hit me, buddy. Come on.
I want to go back to normal.
I'm with you, brother.
what's fucked up about it is, as much as it pisses you off, the hand that you were dealt ain't going anywhere...
mine, your gram's, gramp's.
my mom's.
or your mom's or any-fucking-body else's.
so fighting it only gets your ass kicked.
so if you can learn that now instead of 20 years from now, fuck.
you know, just smack me in the back of the head.
I've been thinking about getting in the water.
you've been going out.
getting in the way I used to.
competing?
I don't know. I guess, maybe.
you wanna run by gram and grab your stuff, trade a few, see who busts bigger?
if you can handle being dusted.
that's not gonna be an issue, grom.
thanks for the room, Bill.
shaun and I are gonna go get wet.
fine. Good.
Thanks, Bill.
fine.
Stinkweed's in great shape.
you're the fucking mess.
Linc, the money wants you out.
I'm your friend.
you made the company. I'd like to see you go with your pockets full, but...
you are going, Linc.
buy you out, throw you out, blow you out, they'll play it the way it fucking lays.
Yeah, I fucking know who his father is
I left Shaunie with Butchie's parents.
and what do you do for a living?
adult film actress.
do you know Linc Stark?
Yes.
how did you meet him?
he picked me up.
and do you have a contractual arrangement with Linc Stark involving your son Shaun Yost?
he's offered me a contractual arrangement.
she's his mother.
the company wants him.
I don't want to have to play the rest of the tape for you, Linc.
go ahead.
no.
I've been your friend too long.
maybe it's what I need to hear.
do what you gotta do.
no, Linc.
I want you to leave the company so I can give you the tape.
you can do whatever the fuck you want with it and you can walk away rich.
are you asking me to fib?
are you asking me to write you another check?
cause I will if you will.
isn't that a felony in this state?
offering someone money to lie?
what's their number to buy me out?
$35 million.
$65 million.
with a five-year no-compete...
and you give me that tape.
okay.
money want the yes on tape?
I hope you're not saying they don't trust me.
watch your back with wonder boy.
pretty lady feeding the birds.
how did that go?
turned the tables on that cocksucker, thanks to your wily ways.
then I agreed to get bought out, which is what they'd sent him to do.
$65 million.
bonus is.
I get to be scared to death.
is that a change?
maybe not.
maybe not.
for a million, can I hold your hand?
when I strike, it's gonna be for the big money.
Hey, captain Kirk.
you were right about being more miserable.
getting dusted won't be an issue.
don't get hit by a bus.
I know I am getting better and stronger when...
I can be alone at home even though the person who died is no longer there.
where else am I gonna be?
memories of the person who died make me smile, not cry.
well, that one's easier said than done.
I laugh at my friends' stupid jokes.
I don't have any friends.
I make stupid jokes.
well, I try to amuse the kid.
I mean I'm not a comedian.
M. D.
it's not like I'm a doctor or anything.
Dale, veni, Dale.
what's that?
I don't know.
okay, this is for free, for nothing.
shape changer.
Oh, yeah?
if they weren't looking to embarrass the poor girl, they'd blur out where her dress came up.
Gracias, gracias.
shaun will soon be gone.
how much is that worth?
cause the big money is staying in escrow for whoever can tell me what the fuck is going on.
Hey, OLD MAN!
I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS THIS FAR DOWN.
I KEPT CATCHING THOSE REALLY LONG RIGHTS.
keep DOING THAT AND YOU'LL END UP IN ROSARITA.
Hey, I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTRUDE.
it's A LONG WALK BACK.
my CAR IS HERE IF YOU WANT A RIDE.
you SHOULD WATCH YOUR FEET. I STEPPED ON A SYRINGE HERE YESTERDAY.
Yeah, WELCOME TO THE SLOOZE.
who's THAT CHICK? IS SHE A FAN OF YOURS?
all MY FANS ARE IN RETIREMENT HOMES.
Mitch YOST, YOU PROBABLY DON'T REMEMBER ME,
but I MET YOU ONCE. PIPE MASTERS.
I WAS 15,
and I GOT TO TELL YOU I HAD A BIG CRUSH.
my NAME IS CASS. - GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK.
I DIDN'T NOTICE, HUH?
I WAS STILL KNOCK-KNEED WITH BRACES.
- WELL, EVERYTHING CHANGES.
Yeah, I MAKE MOVIES NOW.
uh, THANKS ANYWAYS, POP. I'M GONNA WALK AND GET SOME AIR.
all RIGHT, KAI. - NICE CAR, CHICK.
these ARE HARD TO FIND.
I LIKE VINTAGE. WHAT CAN I SAY?
so, I'M DOING THIS FILM. IT'S CALLED "LEGENDS."
I WOULD LOVE TO SHOOT YOU FOR IT.
I KNOW THIS REALLY ISN'T YOUR KIND OF THING,
but YOU KNOW MY NAME AND YOU'VE GOT MY NUMBER.
just THINK ABOUT IT.
okay.
why'd I HANG UP? I GOT TIRED OF BEING HELD ON HOLD.
good THING I'M NOT BEING ROBBED HERE.
I'm LOOKING INTO A NUTJOB,
ascertain IF HE'S WANTED OR MISSING.
I GOT HIS PRINTS HERE. I WANT HIM LIFTED.
why AM I CALLING AHEAD?
well, ANDERSON, THAT'S TO AVOID STANDING THERE
like A MOPE WITH MY HAT IN MY HAND SOMEPLACE I WORKED 16 YEARS
while MY REQUEST IS WALKED THROUGH CHANNELS.
what ARE THE PRINTS ON?
you ASK ME THAT, I THINK MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T TRIED THE WATER FOUNTAIN THIS MORNING.
his PRINTS ARE ON THE FUCKING HANDLE WHICH I AM IN FUCKING POSSESSION OF.
Hey, YOU KNOW WHAT? FUCK YOU.
where ARE YOU GONNA DRINK? TRY THE TOILET.
and WHILE YOU'RE IN THERE, GO FUCK YOURSELF.
but YOU REALLY OUGHT TO BE DOING IS UPDATING THE GODDAMN BULLETIN BOARD!
preparation FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THE MILLENNIUM
was A GODDAMN DISGRACE.
16 FUCKING YEARS.
how DID YOU SLEEP?
how DID YOU SLEEP?
I SLEPT, YOU KNOW?
you KNOW, I DO KNOW THAT I'M NOT FEELING DOPE-SICK RIGHT NOW.
what ARE YOU DOING? YOU GOT TO TAKE A HORRENDOUS DUMP TOO?
because I GOT TO TAKE A HORRENDOUS DUMP, PAL.
I GOT TO TAKE A HORRENDOUS DUMP.
fuck.
FIRSTIES ON THE CAN. I GOT THE FACE.
damn, BUT MAKE IT QUICK, ALL RIGHT?
drop YOUR PANTS. ASS ON THAT SEAT, BABY, AND PUSH.
I GOTS TO GO.
come ON.
Oh, SHIT. ARE YOU SHY ABOUT DOING YOUR BUSINESS, JOHN?
I'm SHY ABOUT DOING MY BUSINESS.
shit, I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU DUMP OR TAKE LEAK SINCE YOU GOT HERE.
do YOU WANT ME TO STEP OUTSIDE?
John: I DON'T KNOW BUTCHIE INSTEAD.
Hey, WE ALL HAVE OUR QUIRKS AND WRINKLES, PAL.
it IS ALL GOOD.
Jo JO GOT THROUGH HIS HEAT.
anyways.
I GOT YOUR DEMO, MAN. IT ROCKS.
it's ABOUT SHAUN,
and THE EVENT AT HUNTINGTON.
give ME TWO MINUTES TO TELL YOU WHAT I CAN DO.
well, HURRY UP.
Mitch WILL BE HOME ANY MINUTE.
what's SHAKING, RAMON?
dickstein SAID NEW OWNER'S COMING OVER.
strapped LIKE HE WAS YESTERDAY?
should BE RELEVANT TO YOU,
since YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GONE NOW.
you DUMPED OUT, JOHN?
I'm DUMPED OUT.
stand UP AND PULL YOUR PANTS UP.
the KID'S TURN ON THE CRAPPER.
there YOU GO. COME ON.
do THAT OUTSIDE. I GOT TO GO.
here.
park IT RIGHT HERE, MY MAN.
good, WELL DONE.
A-plus ON THE FUME-CONTROL, PAL.
radio SILENCE NOW, JOHN UNTIL FURTHER NOTIFICATION.
this IS A DUMP THAT A GROWN MAN CAN BE PROUD OF.
what THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?
Cissy: YOU NEED TO HEAR HIM, MITCH.
Shaun's BACK IN AT HUNTINGTON.
you MUSCLED HIM IN.
Yeah, THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES, SHAUNIE.
you MISS YOUR HEAT...
as LONG AS YOU CAN HEAR THE MONEY TALK, YOU GOT NO PROBLEM.
you JUST SIGN UP WITH THE MAN,
get THE SPONSOR'S PUSH, WIN YOURSELF A HUMMER.
just THIS ONCE, MITCH,
think WHAT SHAUN WANTS.
you KNOW, I WAS A GROM JUST LIKE YOU ONCE. ALWAYS IN THE WATER.
totally STOKED 24/7.
I FELT LIKE I WAS TAPPING INTO SOMETHING BIGGER.
and I'LL TELL YOU,
a LOT OF PEOPLE CAN PADDLE OUT THERE AND GET THAT RUSH,
but TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM A TASTE OF IT JUST BY WATCHING...
no, THAT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
and I NEVER HAD THAT.
not LIKE YOU AND YOUR DAD...
and YOUR GRANDPA.
but I COULD SEE THAT PEOPLE WOULD PAY TO SEE THOSE WHO COULD DO IT.
and I MADE SOME MONEY.
and I MADE SOME MISTAKES.
your DAD, BUTCHIE, WAS ONE OF THEM.
I WAS YOUNG, HE WAS CHANGING THE SPORT.
all I COULD SEE WAS THAT HIM BEING A BAD BOY
was GOOD FOR BUSINESS.
I THOUGHT THE IMAGE WAS THE THING.
what I SEE NOW
what's TAKEN ME YEARS TO SEE...
is THE THING ITSELF-- THAT'S THE THING.
and I DON'T HAVE TO SHOW THEM ANY MORE THAN THAT.
to GET THEM TO BUY THE THING THAT YOU WANT TO SELL THEM.
Well， WHAT IF I'M SELLING THEM THE THING FOR ITSELF?
I THINK YOU'RE A FUCKING SAINT.
well, I GOT ALL THE MONEY I NEED, CISSY.
Yeah, WELL, THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER.
it's THE WAY SOME OF US NEED IT.
does THAT RULE ME OFF THE TEAM?
Shaun: I'D LIKE TO COMPETE.
I LIKE IT.
Linc: IF YOU FEEL ME GOING OFF WITH SHAUN, JUST TELL ME.
I WOULD BE GRATEFUL TO HEAR IT.
no IMAGE.
just HIM AND SOME REALLY GREAT WAVES.
so HUNTINGTON'S CROSSED-UP SWELL.
what DO YOU THINK?
you WANT TO TRY
I MIGHT TRY IT.
a DAY LIKE THIS, JOHN,
if YOU CAN GET THE DEALER'S ASS OUT OF BED,
the PIER'S A NICE PLACE TO COP A FIX.
let's GET THE DEALER'S ASS OUT OF BED, BUTCHIE.
we're NOT HERE TO SCORE, MY BROTHER.
although I CAN'T SAY WHY I'M NOT GETTING DOPE-SICK.
found YOUR MAN, EH, FRAT BOY?
comfy COZY, SWEET PEA.
how DIDN'T I FIGURE YOU TWO WOULD KNOW EACH OTHER?
we DON'T. I DROVE HIM OVER TO YOUR PLACE YESTERDAY.
I NEVER GOT HIGH OVERSEAS LIKE I NEEDED TO GET AFTER THAT RIDE.
did YOU COME IN THROUGH THE SLOOZE, JOHN?
and DON'T GO OVER THE RAILING!
I CAME IN FROM THE SLOOZE AND I WON'T GO OVER THE RAILING, BUTCHIE.
Butchie: IS THAT WHERE YOU PICKED HIM UP?
you THINK HE MAY BE A MEXICAN?
I'm TRYING TO GET A LINE ON HIM, JOE.
why DO YOU THINK I NEEDED TO FIRE UP THAT FATTY?
Butchie: MY OLD MAN LEVITATED.
I'm NOT FEELING SICK. JOHN, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
John, YOU CAN BE HONEST WITH ME, MAN.
tell ME WHAT'S GOING ON.
John, TELL ME WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON.
what ARE YOU LOOKING AT OUT THERE, JOHN?
what DO YOU SEE?
what DO YOU WANT, BUTCHIE?
come ON, PAL. WE'LL FIGURE IT ALL OUT.
Butchie: JOE, SMOKE ANOTHER FATTY, BABY.
so HE SAID TO MEET HERE IN THE OFFICE?
specifically INSIDE THE OFFICE.
seemed IN GOOD SPIRITS WHEN HE CALLED.
yesterday TOO UNTIL HE PULLED OUT HIS GAT.

Barry: IS SO, RAMON.
I HAD A VISION, GENTLEMEN.
is THAT HOW YOU GOT THE NUMBERS FOR THE JACKT? - IN FACT, RAMON, YES.
I OFTEN GET VISIONS AFTER MY SEIZURES.
eventful DAYS LIKE YESTERDAY DO TEND TO BRING THEM ON.
Teddy AND I HAD QUITE THE SIEGE.
the NEXT DRAWING IS ON TUESDAY.
I LOOKED IT UP.
Barry: NO NUMBERS IN LAST NIGHT'S VISION, RAMON.
I AM CALLED, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
to LEARN TO SURF.
I HAVE THE PERFECT BOARD FOR YOU TO LEARN ON.

motel IS CLOSED.

he WENT OUT, BUTCHIE.
he's IN NUMBER F.
you COULD LEAVE IT ON THE DOOR,IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE A MESSAGE.
I'll GIVE IT TO HIM WHEN HE SHOWS UP.
Oh, PASTRY WHILE YOU WAIT?
why RAISE A BUILDING FOR WHAT ITS WALLS HAVE ?
why NOT IMAGINE IT'S SHUTTERED SALOON AS SOME HOMIER PLACE OF ENTERTAINMENT?
renovate THE GUEST ROOMS.
upgrade, LIBERATE THEM.
why NOT?
room 24.
excuse ME.
it's HIS JOINT.
he LOOKS LIKE THE BOWZER GUY FROM SHA NA NA.
it's OKAY.
it's OKAY.
it's OKAY.
no NO NO NO.
Yeah. - IT'S SHAUN, BILL.
Hey, SHAUN, COME ON IN. GIVE ME A HAND HERE.
I'm JUST ABOUT TO CLEAN THESE CAGES.
guess WHAT? - YOU FOUND A DINOSAUR EGG.
I'm BACK IN THE CONTEST.
is THAT SO?
that CONTEST AT HUNTINGTON I MISSED YESTERDAY.
this GUY IS GETTING ME BACK IN.
my HEAT'S IN TWO HOURS. - JESUS, THAT DOESN'T LEAVE US MUCH
my GRAM AND GRAMPS ARE TAKING ME.
is THAT SO? - THIS GUY TALKED TO THEM.
we LEFT MY DAD A MESSAGE. MAYBE HE'LL COME TOO.
good, FINE. - YOU WANT TO GO UP THERE WITH US?
my GRAM AND GRAMPS ARE RIGHT OUTSIDE. - RIGHT OUTSIDE?
Jesus, SHAUN. NO, I CAN'T.
this IS A FAMILY OUTING. THIS IS
this IS A FAMILY THING. I CAN'T GO.
no, YOU GO AHEAD.
bill's NOT COMING.
well THERE'S THAT. - Bill: THANKS ANYWAY.
I'll CHEER HIM ON FROM DOWN HERE. - THAT'S ALL RIGHT, BILL.
we UNDERSTAND. - I GOT TO GET AFTER THE ACCUMULATION.
they're CRAP MACHINES. MY BIRDS, THEY'RE CRAP MACHINES.
Ah. - YOU DO GOOD, SHAUNIE.
drive SAFE.
good FOR THEM.
maybe SHAUN'S NE'ER-DO-WELL FATHER
and HIS JERK-OFF SIDEKICK WILL GO UP THERE TOO.
that WOULD BE NICE.
Linc: She's like the kid's second mother.
I can't believe she saw you hit on Mitch this morning.
you KNOW, LINC, I ACTUALLY DO MAKE FILMS. - That's the trick.
that's what you're supposed to make her think you're here for.
arguably, IT IS WHAT I'M DOING HERE.
is IT... ARGUABLY?
I'll SEE YOU AT HUNTINGTON.
Yeah, YOU'LL SEE ME, BUT YOU WON'T FUCKING TALK TO ME.
Yeah, AND FOR CHRISTMAS, I WAS THINKING I COULD EITHER RUN YOU OVER IN THE STREET
or ENROLL YOU IN A TONY ROBBINS SEMINAR.
BUTCHIE, HEY.
I GUESS YOU AND YOUNG EINSTEIN ARE OUT.
anyway, SO CISSY JUST CALLED,
and SHE MUST HAVE SPIKED MITCH'S WHEAT GERM.
he's LETTING SHAUN SURF IN THE CONTEST AT HUNTINGTON.
I BET SHAUN WOULD LIKE IT IF YOU WENT UP THERE.
I'm NOT GOING. I'M HIP-DEEP IN CUSTOMERS HERE.
Huntington, SHIT-FOR-BRAINS.
did YOU GET MITCH IN YOUR PORSCHE?
you SHOW HIM HOW THE GEAR BOX WORKED?
I MAKE MOVIES.
I WANT TO MAKE ONE ABOUT MITCH.
it's OBVIOUS THAT HE RESPECTS YOU A LOT,
although IT'S NOT AS OBVIOUS
as YOU AND I GETTING OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT THIS MORNING.
no SALE, CHICK.
Mitch's WIFE JUST CALLED-- CISSY.
Shaun's IN AN EVENT AT HUNTINGTON.
first TIME MITCH EVER LET HIM ENTER.
well, MAYBE I'LL GO.
Yeah, MAYBE I'LL GO TOO.
you KNOW, THAT FAMILY'S GOT ENOUGH OF THEIR OWN PROBLEMS,
but CAN'T WE ALL STILL DO OUR LITTLE PARTS TO MAKE THEM WORSE?
I'll TELL YOU SOMETHING.
and I'M NOT A FRIGHTENED PERSON BY NATURE
but I'M AFRAID HERE SUDDENLY.
I'm FEELING A REAL GENUINE FRIGHTENED FEELING.
something's BEHIND ME OR WHATEVER THE HELL MIGHT BE GOING ON.
I'm AFRAID HERE TO EVEN TURN AROUND AND LOOK.
isn't THAT SOMETHING, ZIP?
brother.
is THAT YOU, LOIS?
is THAT YOU, HONEY?
I WISH SHE'D COME TO ME.
she USED TO COME TO ME IN DREAMS.
Barry: THE MOTEL IS HAUNTED.
at LEAST ROOM 24 IS HAUNTED.
you HAD MENTIONED YOU HAD AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE THERE.
it WAS ALL ONE IN MY MIND.
time FLIES WHEN YOU'RE HAVING FUN.
mega MILLIONS ARE NOT THE BROOM TO SWEEP ROOM 24 CLEAN.
must I SAY FOR ME?
isn't "FOR ME" UNDERSTOOD?
you're GETTING A LITTLE HARD TO FOLLOW.
not FOR GILBERT ROLLINS. HE CAN DO IT DEAD.
well, YOU'RE WITH US NOW.
you DON'T HAVE TO GO IN THAT ROOM NO MORE. - FUCK ROOM 24.
thank YOU.
thank YOU. - NO, IT'S OKAY.
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING HAPPY.
I MISTOOK THAT FREEDOM FOR POWER.
ghost SHOWED YOU WHAT WAS WHAT.
Yes. YES, RAMON.
our VISIONS ARE POWERLESS AGAINST OUR PASTS.
happiness IS HELPLESS IN PASSING.
please, GOD...
help ME LIVE.
I FORGIVE GILBERT ROLLINS.
I FORGIVE BUTCHIE YOST.
thank YOU FOR MY FRIENDS.
Amen. - AMEN.
Amen.
you DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING THROUGH, MARCO, BECAUSE HE'S HANGING WITH BUTCHIE.
and IF HE'S HANGING WITH BUTCHIE, HE AIN'T JUICED.
he's JUICED.
I AM HANGING WITH A MAN OF MEANS.
this IS MY BROTHER FROM ANOTHER MOTHER
from THE SIDE OF THE FAMILY WITH SOME CHEESE.
and IF THAT DOESN'T GO THROUGH, THIS WILL.
and THAT AIN'T MY COCK!
you ARE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE, MARCO.
that's RIGHT! THAT'S RIGHT, LADIES.
the LINE FORMS TO MY LEFT TO BLOW ME.
the LINE FORMS TO BUTCHIE'S LEFT.
okay, JUST TO SEE HOW MUCH FUEL WE HAVE IN THIS ROCKET,
I WILL TAKE HALF OF THE
no, I WILL TAKE THE WHOLE ROW OF CHIVAS REGAL.
could WE TRY MY DAD AGAIN?
sure WE CAN.
Shaun: CAN I CALL HIM?
then WHY DON'T WE GET OUT OF THE CAR
and BANG OUR HEADS ON THAT LAMP POST UNTIL THE LIGHT CHANGES?
do NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH THE CARDBOARD MODELS, JOHN.
papercuts ON THE PENIS-- VERY PAINFUL.
wait TILL THE-- NO NO NO NO.
Jesus, JOHN.
what THE FUCK? OKAY, FOLLOW MY LEAD.
I SAY THIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, BROTHER, AND WITH ALL THE LOVE
but I'M PICKING UP YOU DON'T DO TOO WELL WITH TRAFFIC, DO YOU?
I DON'T DO TOO WELL WITH TRAFFIC.
which LEADS ME TO BELIEVE-- COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
quick, FOLLOW ME.
leads ME TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE NOT FROM AROUND HERE.
I'm NOT FROM AROUND HERE, BUTCHIE. - OH YEAH, NO?
or ANY OTHER METROPOLIS FOR THAT MATTER.
I'm FEELING KIND OF A, YOU KNOW, SMALL TOWN.
not A FARM TOWN, BUT A SMALL TOWN.
a SMALL TOWN LIKE, YOU KNOW, I'M FEELING A LITTLE CINCINNATI.
I AM FROM CINCINNATI! - GET THE FUCK OUT.
you GET THE FUCK OUT. - GET THE FUCK OUT.
the HOUSING BRAIN UNIT'S OPEN 24 HOURS, BABY.
man: LINC, THIS IS BULLSHIT.
my KID EARNED HIS SPOT IN THIS ROUND.
what IS THIS?
what THIS IS, MR. DOLAN, IS YOUR SON'S MAIN SPONSOR,
who IS ABOUT TO SEND HIM AND YOU ON A MAG TRIP TO SUMATRA,
is SAYING TOMMY HAD TO TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM.
Dolan: YEAH, OKAY, TEAM IS ONE THING.
but BUTCHIE YOST'S KID, THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE.
Linc: YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET ME BE POLITE?
you DO NOT GET A VOTE ABOUT SHAUNIE YOST.
you GET TO VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU PASS ON SUMATRA.

FREDDY: NO, THAT CALL WAS A FUCKING FAVOR TO ME.
it REMINDED ME OF WHAT A FUCKUP YOU TURNED INTO,
instead WHO I WATCHED SURF ROCKY POINT.
I WAS PISSED OFF YOU BEAT ME ON THE FUCKING BUY.

reporter: I'd doubt the connection with the minor area temblors we've been reporting, Bob, have had much to do with this.
all we know at this point is that the young surfer broke his neck while competing at Huntington Beach and has en listed in grave condition at Mercy Hospital.
Bob: And this is the famous surfing Yost family?
that COULD BE SHAUN. WHO ARE THEY DISCUSSING?
where IS HE?!
what's HIS CONDITION FOR CHRIST'S SAKE?
Oh MY GOD!
don't YELL AT ME. DON'T YELL AT ME. DON'T YELL AT ME.
don't YELL AT ME. DON'T YELL AT ME.
don't YELL AT ME.
Anderson! ANDERSON, FOR GOD'S SAKE, DON'T HANG UP ON ME.
please HELP ME FIND AN INJURED FRIEND.
woman on P. A. Dr. Hurst, 4672. Dr. Hurst 4672.
I WON'T INTRUDE ON THEM, BUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING THEY NEED
the FAMILY, ERRANDS
or WHATEVER THE HOSPITAL DOESN'T PROVIDE,
I'm AVAILABLE TO DO THAT DAY OR NIGHT.
okay.
well,
I HAVE TERRIBLE NEWS TO SHARE WITH YOU.
shaun HAS SUFFERED DEVASTATING INJURIES.
the VERTEBRAE AT THE BASE OF HIS SKULL WAS CRUSHED WHEN HE FELL,
and THAT LEFT HIM PARALYZED AND UNABLE TO BREATHE.
a MACHINE IS BREATHING FOR HIM NOW, BUT THE TIME HE WAS WITHOUT OXYGEN
our TESTS SHOW THAT THERE IS
no ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN SHAUN'S BRAIN.
so YOU'RE SAYING HE'S BRAIN-DEAD.
you're SAYING THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO. - I'M SORRY, BUT I THINK THAT'S THE CASE.
we'll RUN OUR TEST AGAIN IN THE MORNING,
but I DON'T EXPECT TO SEE A CHANGE.
why PUT HIM THROUGH THE TESTS THEN?
before LATER DECISIONS CAN BE MADE.
Yeah, BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN NOW.
a PROTOCOL IS DEVELOPED IN THESE SITUATIONS.
your PROTOCOL'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS SUFFERING?
to TAKE A PATIENT OFF LIFE SUPPORT,
possibly MAKING HIS ORGANS AVAILABLE FOR TRANSPLANT,
those AREN'T CLIFFS YOU CAN RECLIMB.
why DON'T YOU LEAVE THE CLIFFS OUT OF IT?
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE SUFFERING TERRIBLY.
if IT'S ANY CONSOLATION, I ASSURE YOU,YOUR GRANDSON IS NOT.
you GET TO CRUCIFY HIM WITH ANOTHER 12 HOURS OF TESTS.
Mrs. YOST, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ASK ME?
no. DOCTOR, GO AWAY.
I'll BE WITH SHAUN.
you TAKE SHAUNIE OFF THAT MACHINE, MITCH,
you BETTER NEVER GET IN OUR BED AGAIN.
did YOU HEAR ANYTHING THAT ASSHOLE SAID?
he NEEDS IT TO BREATHE. HE STAYS ON THE MACHINE.
I WILL MURDER YOU IN YOUR SLEEP.
SHAUNIE IS BRAIN-DEAD, CISSY.
he's BREATHING AND I CAN HOLD HIM. - WELL, GET A DOG.
he's DEAD.
I WANT HIM OFF THE MACHINES.
you WANT TO GET BACK TO YOUR CLUBHOUSE, GO AHEAD.
get OUT, YOU COWARD!
get OUT AND LEAVE ME ALONE WITH MY GRANDSON.
you're AFRAID OF THE HOSPITAL, NOT ME.
I GOT USED TO IT, ALL THE MONTHS I SPENT LISTENING TO THE ASSHOLE I MARRIED WHINE ABOUT KILLING HIMSELF 'CAUSE HIS KNEE WAS GONE. HE COULDN'T BE KING OF THE WAVES.
Mitch YOST, THE BIG REALIST.
let's FACE IT, CISSY, HE'S GONE.
let's JUST PUT HIM IN THE GROUND.
well, WHEN THE TIME COMES, WHY DON'T YOU JUST SIGN WHATEVER PAPERS IT IS THEY NEED YOU TO SIGN?
should I GO IN? - I DON'T KNOW.
did HE DIE?
your MOTHER WILL EXPLAIN IT.
did HE DIE? - NO.
cissy IS IN THERE.
how's IT GOING?
did YOU DU OUT THIS MORNING?
Uh-huh.
you NEED TO DUMP OUT?
okay, COME ON.
he WAS GOING FOR A LITTLE COVER-UP ON THE INSIDE, THE WATER SUCKED OUT.
was HE DOING GOOD BEFORE HE ATE IT?
he HAD IT WON.
can WE GO SEE HIM?
he's DUMPING OUT.
this IS MY SON MITCHELL JUNIOR. SHAUN'S FATHER.
how DO YOU DO?
can WE GO IN? - PLEASE.
is IT OKAY II TOUCH HIM?
I THOUGHT ONE DAY, A DAY WITH NO DOGFIGHTS, I'D SQUARE THINGS.
you KNOW, SURF SOME SPOTS WITH HIM IN INDONESIA, MAYBE.
I THOUGHT WE'D HAVE THE TIME.
Cissy: THEY ASKED ABOUT DONATING SHAUN'S ORGANS.
Nurse: I SURF.
you WERE GREAT.
you KNOW, I COULD INTRODUCE YOU TO HIM IF YOU WANT.
or YOU COULD KEEP PRETENDING YOU DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER.
Hi, I'M LINC STARK.
Hi.
get WITH MITCH. - UH, CAN YOU HOLD THAT, PLEASE?
like MY HEART'S BEATING IN A CARTOON.
are YOU HERE TO SEE SHAUN?
Yes, I AM.
can I SEE HIM?
I DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE NOW ABOUT THE ORGANS, RIGHT?
I'd STILL HAVE THE 12 HOURS TO CHANGE MY MIND.
you've BEEN MORE FATHER TO HIM THAN I WAS.
excuse ME.
okay, ZIP.
now, DON'T HOLD BACK ON ME, PAL.
I JUST TOOK A DUMP A GROWN MAN WOULD BE PROUD OF.
Attaboy.
A-plus FOR FUME CONTROL, BUTCHIE?
A-plus, JOHN.
the END IS NEAR.
that's IT, ZIP. THAT'S IT.
and KISS SHAUNIE TOO AS LONG AS WE'RE BEING STUPID.
Jesus, MARY AND JOSEPH.
what are you stopping for?
I'm getting a little nervous.
how come?
I don't know.
he's in love, dummy.
I am not Mark.
come on, let's go.
wait.
I need to know if she's there before we go in?
you said she's helping during lunch time all summer.
I mean I think she is.
she's been in there 3 days in a row so
I'm just thinking she does.
her dad's the owner. She's in there. Let's go.
you go look first.
just to see if she's there.
this is stupid. - I'd do it for you, Albert.
alright.
alright.
she's in there.
okay, now I'm really nervous.
don't be nervous.
maybe we should just come back another day.
we're on your side, Dustin.
okay, but you guys better not embarrass me.
Hey, guys.
Hi, Tanya.
Hey, Tanya.
what can I get for you?
um, I'll have a hot fudge sundae.
okay, one hot fudge.
I'll have a banana split with two strawberries and one chocolate.
no pineapple syrup?
no, I don't like pineapple.
neither do I.
Dustin.
Oh, um, I'll get a hot fudge sundae too.
okay.
coming right up.
what are you doing talking so much with my girl?
what do you mean?
you know, talking to her about the pineapple and stuff.
you talked to her more than I did.
someone had to.
I'm telling you, Dustin, I think you're in love.
I am not.
I think you are.
I don't know what being in love is.
it's what you're feeling right now.
how do you know?
I just do.
how?
you've never been in love.
but my older sister is right now and she told me how it feels and she looks at her boyfriend the same way Dustin does when he sees Tanya.
O，o，o，o，o, Dustin's in love.
Dustin's in love.
come on guys, cut it out.
you'd better watch yourself, I think Nick likes her too.
but she doesn't like Nick.
she talks to him when he talks to her.
so that doesn't mean she likes him.
Dustin's right.
Tanya talks to a lot of people.
Nick.
I'd like to see someone knock his block off.
I hate him.
I think I'm going to ask Tanya out.
on a date?
I'm thinking about it.
you ever ask a girl out before?
no.
you?
no.
you, Albert?
no.
what are you going to ask her out to?
I don't know.
walk her home from the diner or invite her to my house.
I'd wouldn't do it.
not with Nick around.
I told you she doesn't like him.
Yeah, but he likes her.
that'll be enough to keep me away.
mom, I'm home.
Oh, hi, Dustin, I just wrote you a note.
Mrs. Farley called she'd like for you to mow her lawn tomorrow and I told her you'd call her back.
okay.
okay.
now I have a meeting tonight so I left you some money. Why don't you treat the boys to a pizza and
I should be back around 7: 30.
Thanks, Mom.
okay.
don't forget call Mrs. Farley.
I won't.
here we go, boys.
time to dig in.
great.
I'm starving.
me too.
I'll take this one.
Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, hi, Nick.
come on, Nick, this is our pizza.
you got a problem with something Alberta?
no.
didn't think so.
I hate it when he calls me that.
out of my way.
Hey, I was playing.
Oh Nick, I didn't know it was you.
I'd be careful if I was you.
Yep.
I hate him.
well, it looks like you've done a real good job here young man.
Mrs. Farley will be very happy.
Oh, thank you.
I've seen you at our church many times, haven't I?
Ah, yeah.
you're, um, you're Mr. Sperry, right?
that's right.
jonathan Sperry.
and your name is ah...
um, let me think.
Dustin.
Dustin Sharp.
Yes, I know your mother.
you know, I used to mow my own lawn there but, ahh, I'm not getting around like I used to.
so I think it would be a lot easier if I hired a professional like yourself.
so what do you think? You think you can fit me into your schedule and mow my lawn?
Yeah, of course.
um, I'll mow it as soon as I'm done with here.
well, that sounds just fine.
okay, ah.
I'll be over in a few minutes.
just let me know if you need anything.
Ah, okay, thank you.
no, thank you.
Mr. Sperry, I'm finished.
okay, Dustin.
come in, come in.
you did a very fine job.
here, come and sit down.
I was watching you from my window.
and it's very kind of you to rake the grass the way you do.
Thanks.
my mom wants me to a good job so, you know, I try.
well, you do. How about some freshly squeezed lemonade.
I make it myself.
Mmm.
it's good.
it's the best.
I've been drinking it that way for years.
you have a real nice house, Mr. Sperry.
do you live alone?
Yes, yes I do.
my wife passed away 4 years ago.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
finest Christian woman I ever knew.
the Lord allowed us to be together 46 years.
that's sure is a long time.
Oh. Yes.
seems short now.
anyway, how much do I owe you?
two dollars sound fair?
two dollars?
well, it did take me almost an hour and that's what I usually charge.
well, I don't think that's fair.
I was really thinking about three.
thank you, Mr. Sperry.
I'd like to have you come back again, say in two weeks or so.
sooner if we get some rain.
okay?
Yes, sir.
alright, then.
you have a good day and thanks for doing such a fine job.
thanks for the three dollars.
you earned it.
so long.
Oh, I almost forgot, I got a new customer today.
Oh, really.
Yeah, I was mowing Mrs Farley's lawn and Mr. Sperry comes over and asked me to mow his.
jonathan Sperry from church?
Yep.
well, good for you.
he is such a nice man.
and, he paid me three dollars.
Wow.
dear Tanya.
how are you?
no.
dear Tanya...
Where's the note?
I got it.
well, are you going to give it to her?
I can't just go up there and give it to her.
why not?
cause I can't.
I gotta get it to her in secret.
just go up there and give it to her.
no.
I'll go then.
no, you won't.
Hey, Tanya, here's a love letter from Dustin, right over here.
Shhh, come on guys.
I thought you guys were supposed to be helping me.
look, why don't you hand it to the other waitress and tell her to give it to Tanya.
no.
I think I'm going to just leave it on the table and when she comes over to clean it she'll find it.
are you going to leave a tip?
I was going to leave a quarter.
that guy just left fifty cents.
all I got is a quarter.
you got any money?
not me, I'm broke.
you Albert?
don't look at me.
you guys are no help.
don't worry about it.
a quarter is good.
woe, big time tipper.
that's all I got.
a quarter is good.
it will get her attention.
are you going to say goodbye?
no, I think I'm just going to play it cool.
here we go.
let's go.
bye Tanya.
what was that?
what, I said goodbye.
I wanted to play it cool.
now she'll think you left the money.
no, she won't.
Yes, she will.
look, you signed the note right, so at least she'll know that's from you.
Oh, Albert.
excuse me, Miss, may I please have a little more coffee?
sure.
thank You. - I'll get your table for you honey.
okay, Thanks.
so come on, are you going to tell us what you said in the note or not?
why should I, it's private.
you can tell us, we won't tell anyone.
yeah right.
I'm surprised you guys haven't called her yet and ruined the whole thing.
I tried to once but her phone was busy.
Albert.
I'm just kidding.
come on, what did the note say?
I just asked her if she wanted to get together with me and I'd be back tomorrow so she could let me know.
wow, Dustin might be going out on his first date.
Hey, there's my newest customer.
what do you mean?
Mr. Sperry, from church.
Yeah, I mowed his lawn yesterday.
Yeah, I've seen him before, he taught my older brother in Sunday school class.
and he gave me the best lemonade after I was done.
he makes it himself.
does he have any more?
would you like some more Albert?
Oh, sure.
it's good, isn't it?
Yes, it's very good.
mark?
Yes, sir.
I made it myself, you know.
thank you.
and Dustin?
no, thank you.
no, thank you.
you had three glasses yesterday.
no, this is enough.
he's too busy thinking about his new girlfriend.
girlfriend?
she's not my girlfriend.
you wrote her a note.
so, that doesn't make her my girlfriend.
her name is Tanya.
Tanya?
Albert.
she's a girl in our class that works at the diner.
her father owns it.
the problem is that Nick likes her too.
quiet, Albert.
Nick's a bully.
quiet.
I told him I thought it was a mistake.
Albert, will you be quiet.
what am I doing?
you talked.
I was just telling.
so, it's a delicate situation then?
Yeah, I guess so.
you know, I remember the first girl I had feelings for.
I was just about your age too.
her name was Martha.
a very pretty girl.
I liked her so much I couldn't even talk to her.
that's Dustin.
Oh, then I know how he feels.
I tried to pass a note to Martha during class one day and it dropped to the floor.
the Teacher saw it, picked it up and read it out loud to everybody.
I was asking Martha if she liked me.
boy was I embarrassed.
Oh wow, can you imagine.
if I only knew then what I know now.
what do you mean Mr. Sperry?
well, I failed to ask the Lord about Martha.
ask the Lord?
Yes, to see if he wanted me to spend more time with her.
turned out she wasn't interested in anything I thought was important.
could have saved me a lot embarrassment.
the Lord is interested in the girls we like?
Absolutely.
the Lord is interested in everything in our lives.
Yeah, I know.
the Bible is always saying don't do this, and don't do that.
Oh, I never look at it that way.
what do you mean?
everything in the Bible is there to make our lives better.
now the Bible says not to steal, do you want anyone stealing from you, Mark?
no.
well, I guess that's a pretty good thing then, isn't it?
Yeah, I guess it is.
and the Bible says not to lie.
do you want anyone lying to you, Albert?
no.
well, I guess that's a pretty good thing too isn't it?
I never thought of it that way.
I hardly ever read my Bible.
I'm not sure where my Bible is.
me neither.
I see.
I tell you what.
Ah, why don't you try to locate your Bibles and if you do, come by my house say Friday afternoon two o'clock.
I have something I want to show you.
and it has to do with chocolate cake.
chocolate cake?
Yes.
chocolate cake.
you like chocolate cake, don't you?
I love chocolate cake.
well then, can I expect the three of you?
I'm not doing anything, I can make it.
me too.
I love chocolate cake.
good.
I will see you around two o'clock.
but... remember you must bring your Bibles.
I'm getting a little nervous.
why, it's just a girl.
you're too young to understand.
what do you mean? I'm just as old as you are.
Yeah, but not in your brain.
what's that suppose to mean?
like I said, you're too young to understand.
cut it out, guys.
I don't think I can do this.
not again.
I mean what if she says no.
look, you said in the note you were going to come back today for an answer right?
right.
so, you need to find out sooner or later.
Yeah, come on.
think positive, maybe she'll say yes.
okay.
where is she?
huh?
I don't see Tanya.
maybe she's in back.
Ah, excuse me, ma'am?
I'll be with you boys in just a minute.
Where's Tanya?
Oh, she had a dentist appointment this afternoon.
what about the note?
Hey, Mom, can I ask you something?
Hmm-hmm.
how old were you when you met Dad?
how old was I?
I met him in high school, I was fifteen.
so, you guys started dating then?
we started to go out.
Where'd you go out to?
we went to football games, basketball games.
he'd walk me home from school, things like that.
why do you want to know?
Oh, nothing, just wondering.
now gentlemen, I have a brief lesson to share with you before we enjoy that chocolate cake that I promised.
first, I have hidden the cake.
I have written notes to the three of you to tell you where that cake can be found.
mark, you must run across the street to the Boone's house.
your note will be hanging from a tree.
that's the white one right?
that's right.
and Albert, you must go across the street to the Freeman's house. They have a bush in the front yard.
your note will be found there.
okay, I know that house.
and Dustin, the note I wrote for you is on this side of the street at the Rafino's house, it's taped to their porch, alright?
got it.
now. I told all these people what we were doing so there's no need for you to worry about them thinking it's strange you're coming to their houses.
but what you do have to worry about is to meet me in the next five minutes in the secret place.
and that secret place is written on your note.
okay?
okay.
alright gentlemen, your five minutes starts...
now!
Mr. Sperry.
we're back here.
where were you Mr. Sperry?
I went down to the end of the street, like the note said but nobody was there.
I couldn't even find my note.
even a couple of the neighbors tried helping me.
must have got blown off the porch.
you guys missed out on the chocolate cake.
Hey, that's not fair.
what happened Mr. Sperry, I did what the note said?
Yes, I know you did, Mark.
but apparently you had the wrong directions.
wrong directions?
at least you found your note.
I couldn't even find mine.
that's because there was no note to find, Dustin.
you mean I never had one?
so we don't get any cake?
I guess not.
you're so lucky, Albert.
and it was great too.
so do any of you understand the lesson here today?
Ah... no sir, not really.
well, what if finding this cake here represented finding heaven?
how come Albert was the only who found it?
because he had the right directions!
Yes, that's right.
so why'd you give me the wrong directions?
because, Mark, you represent all the people in the world who are misdirected.
what about me?
I'm afraid Dustin that you represent all the people that never even heard the name Jesus or even have a Bible.
therefore, they have no direction.
with that being said, do you see how really important it is to read this book?
if you follow its directions, I am sure there will be plenty of room in heaven for all of us.
thanks Mr. Sperry.
Yeah, thanks.
thanks again Mr. Sperry.
Yes, thank you.
would you enjoy another Bible lesson?
we could meet again next Monday afternoon at the same time?
what do you say?
sure, I can be there.
me too.
will there be more chocolate cake?
Albert.
well, I don't know, Albert, I've been leaning more towards chocolate ice cream.
alright.
alright. I'll see you Monday, Mr. Sperry.
good bye boys.
talk to ya later, Dusting. - See you guys.
Dustin, have you got a moment?
I really need you to do me a favor.
okay.
do you know Mr. Barnes that lives across the street there?
I've seen him but I don't really know him.
well, he's up in age like I am, but he's really having a hard time getting around.
I noticed his lawn really needs to be mowed, so I was hoping you might do it.
Oh, I'll pay you for it.
are you sure? I don't want to take your money.
Yes, I'm sure.
just do not tell him I am the one having you to do it, okay?
okay.
Ah, I could do it right now.
I mean, it's not too hot.
I could go over there and ask him.
that will be great.
I am sure Mr. Barnes will really appreciate it.
okay.
who's there?
Mr. Barnes?
Yes.
I would like to mow your lawn.
mow my lawn?
Yes, sir.
I don't need my lawn mowed.
Mr, you don't understand.
I want to do it for free.
for free?
Yes, sir.
nothing's free.
well, this is, sir.
I really want to mow it.
I said I don't need my lawn mowed.
why would he be so mean?
I was real nice to him.
I am sure you were.
I don't understand.
perhaps you should go see him in couple days, maybe he will allow you to do it then.
but, don't tell him who's putting you up to this.
okay?
okay, I won't.
I wonder why Tanya hasn't said anything to you about the note?
I don't know.
well, then go find out.
now?
why not?
I can't talk to her in front of all her friends.
I'll go then.
Albert, no.
I'm just kidding.
quit fooling around.
wait until you start liking a girl.
Dustin's right. He can't talk to her now.
I got an idea.
why don't you just walk over and pretend to do something nearby and we'll watch and see if she notices you.
I can't do that.
why not?
and if she notices you, then we know she's interested.
and if she doesn't then maybe that can save you the embarrassment of talking to her.
no, that's no good.
look, this is gonna be a long summer if we have to go through this every day.
if it was me, I'd wanna know if a girl likes me or not.
and if not, then I'd start liking someone else.
Albert, it's not something you can turn off and on like a water faucet.
if you like someone, you like someone.
okay, then I'm going to go over there and you guys see if she notices me.
then, when I get back, Dustin you walk over and we'll see if she notices you.
I'm not going over there.
well, I am.
Albert.
well, anything?
Nope.
she didn't even look.
well, I guess that's good then.
alright Dustin, it's your turn.
I'm not going to do this.
you have to.
this is a good idea.
if she looks up, it's a good sign.
I don't know.
mark, tell him.
he might have something here.
we could watch her and see how she reacts.
might give you a good idea if she likes you.
okay, I'm going to do it.
Oh, no...
how you girls doing?
hey Nick.
hey Nick.
perfect plan down the drain.
mark.
yes?
telephone.
be right there.
Hello?
hey Mark.
hey Dusting.
Hey, let me ask your opinion on something.
think I should write Tanya another note?
another note?
Yeah, she hasn't gotten back to me yet?
I don't want to call her.
I could ask her about the first one.
you really like her, don't ya?
Yes, I really like her.
and I'm not afraid to say it.
so what do you think I should do?
I don't know.
Oh, let me see what Albert thinks.
and that was the Big Tops on W. A. L. B. Radio.
next up we have a classic from 1953, but first we have the weather.
sunny today with a few scattered clouds and only a ten percent - chance of... - Albert.
yeah?
telephone.
Hello?
Albert.
Dustin.
hey Dustin.
do you think I should write Tanya another note?
what for?
because she hasn't answered my first one.
I wouldn't.
why not?
because Nick likes her.
but she doesn't like him.
you don't know that.
Yes, I do.
how do you know?
you're love blind.
I am not love blind, I just like her, that's all.
then you're like blind.
like blind, there's no such thing.
you're not helping.
I am too.
goodbye, Albert.
what did he say?
he says he thinks it's a mistake cause of Nick.
what does Albert know, he's so immature.
I think I should just write her another note.
wait a second, let's think this through.
you said in the first note that you were going to come back and see her at the diner for an answer right?
yeah and I did.
but she doesn't know that because she was gone.
Yeah, but what about today?
she had to notice us.
Yeah, but maybe there were too many people there and she didn't want to say anything.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
if I were you, I'd go back down to the diner tomorrow by myself and try to talk to her.
okay, I will.
excuse me, ma'am, where's Tanya?
Oh, Tanya and her family just left today for a vacation.
vacation?
well, ahh... Do you know how long they're going to be gone?
I think they'll be gone for at least three weeks.
three weeks?
can I help you with anything?
um, no, no thank you.
okay.
three weeks is a long time.
I wonder where they're going?
I don't know.
her dad probably makes lots of money so he can afford the trip.
Yeah.
I think you should just forget the whole thing.
Why?
because of one word, Nick
I already told you she doesn't like him.
Dustin is right, Tanya doesn't like Nick.
you don't know that.
and she might end up liking me.
Yeah, she might end up liking Dustin.
okay, why are you repeating everything he says.
because it seems that you need to hear everything twice so that it sinks in that skull of yours.
I know I wouldn't want to be liking the same girl that Nick likes. That's for sure.
don't listen to him, Dustin.
I'm not.
fine, don't listen to me, it's your funeral.
Dustin.
dinner's ready.
okay, coming down.
where you going there Dustin?
Hi, Nick.
Roy.
I said: Where you going?
going to visit a friend.
what's that ya got there?
it's just a book.
what book?
it's just a book.
what book?
it's a Bible.
a Bible?
Yeah, I'm going to Bible study.
in the afternoon.
what's this guy going to do, become a priest?
well, see you guys later.
wait a minute.
I didn't say you could go yet.
come on Nick, I gotta go.
let me see that book first.
come on, I'll be late.
let me see the book.
Nick, come on.
I want to see this book
I need the book back. I gotta go.
nice book.
here... Oh... Oops... Sorry.
okay.
now you can go.
sorry I'm late.
you know I always keep an extra copy of the Bible in case of emergencies like this.
you know, many men have attacked this book in order to keep people from reading it.
you see, I'm almost glad that this incident occurred today.
because it will not be easy for you to follow the Lord and there will be many trying times ahead as you live your lives.
but remember, the Lord is always with you.
here you go, your own new copy of the word of God.
I can't take this Bible from you.
it's yours.
no, my friend.
this is yours.
just agree with me you'll put it to good use.
thank you Mr. Sperry.
I will.
Yes.
Mr. Barnes?
you again.
sorry to bother you, sir.
but I noticed your grass is a little higher now and I still want to mow it if you don't mind.
I don't need no one to help me mow my lawn.
but I said I would do it for free.
what is your name?
Dustin. Dustin·Sharp.
who's having you do this?
well...
who?
I can't say.
was it your mother?
no sir.
your father?
no sir, I don't have a father.
what happened to your father?
he died before I was born.
Oh.
then who's having you do this?
I brought my mower.
it's real good, take a look.
I'm not going to let you mow my lawn unless you tell me who put you up to this.
I'll do a good job, you'll see.
now you listen to me.
thanks Mr. Barnes.
come on get it. Woah... double ball.
nice.
come on, get it.
come on Albert keep it going.
you're racking up all those points.
Oh get it. - Hit it, hit it.
I'm trying.
I'm trying.
come on Albert.
keep it going you may beat your high score.
I got a chance.
get it, get it.
I got it.
come on get in.
okay, it's my turn to play.
one minute, I'm playing.
it's my turn to play.
come on Nick, let him finish his game.
I said it's my turn to play.
hold on, I'm about to beat my high score.
I don't care what your score is, Alberta.
you're done.
just let me finish. - Unless you want to make something of it.
no, I guess I'm done.
he bosses people around and picks on whoever he wants.
Yeah, and then you can be playing pin ball and he just come and move you right out of the way and starts playing on your money.
and he's always taking our pizza.
I just wish someone could knock him.
I can't stand him.
Nick ruins it for everybody Mr. Perry, not just for us.
I see.
excuse me.
if you boys will, please follow me.
I have something I'd like to show you.
look around gentlemen take in this scene.
I come here often.
Yes, look around.
this is an important place to visit while you are still alive.
and to listen.
but I don't hear anything.
I don't either.
well, the Bible says in the book of Ecclesiastes it's better to go to a house of mourning than to a house of feasting.
and why?
because death is the end of every man and the living will take it to heart.
you see it makes us think about our own life, death and eternity.
that's why I come here.
alright, listen.
I don't hear anything.
alright stand closer to the tombstones.
and listen very carefully now.
but I'm still not hearing anything.
put your ear to the stone.
why... why didn't you tell me about Jesus?
why, why didn't you tell me?
I needed the Lord in my life to go to heaven.
keep Listening.
I am in agony in this place.
think of everyone you love gentlemen, everyone you know.
even people you may dislike.
and realize this.
one day, every person will die.
they'll either go to heaven or sadly... to hell.
there's no in between.
no second chance.
and no one can escape this fate.
now as for Nick, the thought that comes to mind are the words of Jesus.
love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you.
and in Matthew chapter 5 the Lord says, if a man strikes your right cheek, offer him the other side.
and if a man compels you to drive a mile, go with him two.
what's all that suppose to mean Mr. Sperry?
if your enemy takes a piece of your pizza, offer him two.
hi Mr. Barnes.
what do you want?
I just wanted to stop by to see how you are doing.
how I'm doing?
yes sir.
you trying to make me feel guilty for not paying you?
no sir.
I just wanted to stop by and say hi.
and who's the one having you mow my lawn.
I had fun mowing it.
I'm going to find out who it is.
do you know who Jesus is Mr. Barnes?
what kind of a question is that?
I just want to make sure you go to heaven when you die.
you don't worry about me.
I started reading my Bible every day.
in the Gospel of John that's where you can read about what Jesus says.
I'm going back inside.
well, okay, ahh... it was good talking to you, Mr. Barnes, and see you again soon, when your lawn needs mowing.
you have to put some weight in the cup, dummy.
weight? - Like a rock or something.
you gotta get it to go under.
it was a little scary in the cemetery yesterday.
Yeah, I know.
it gave me the creeps.
Mr. Sperry sure does know a lot about the Bible.
and he's been real nice to us.
we should do something for him.
like what?
I don't know, something.
we could buy him a present.
Yeah, but I don't have very much money.
he's probably got everything.
it would be nice to do something for him though.
Yeah, I know, he's always giving us food.
wait.
I got an idea.
I want to thank you gentlemen for this nice treat.
it was a pleasant surprise.
you're welcome, Mr. Sperry.
we figured we had to pay you back for all that chocolate cake and ice cream that you give us.
and don't forget the lemonade.
you do not have to pay me back.
it's been my pleasure.
but this pizza is a very nice gesture.
thank you my friends.
we eat pizza here a lot.
you know, when I was young, we never had a place like this.
we used to walk downtown and just stand on the corner.
Oh no, look who just walked in.
it's Nick.
Nick.
better hide the pizza.
that's the bully we've been telling you about.
I see.
he looks familiar to me.
I wish he was on another planet.
tell me...
hey Nick, look at that old man over there.
well, who do we got here.
hi Nick.
so Dustin, who's the old timer?
this is our good friend, Mr. Sperry.
Mr. Sparrow, ah, isn't that the name of a bird?
no, it's Mr. Sperry.
well, isn't it past your nap time Gramps?
cause I heard that all old people took afternoon naps.
come on Nick, leave him alone.
he's our friend.
Hey, I am just looking after Gramps' health, make sure he gets his rest.
okay, just leave him alone.
I'll talk to whoever I want to.
but he's a nice man and he's our friend.
I said I'll talk to whoever I want to.
got it?
you're Nick Meyers right?
Yeah, what's it to you?
Victor Meyers' son?
Yeah, so what.
I want you to know you can be very proud of your father.
proud?
what makes you say that?
well, we used to work together on a church committee.
and I got to know him very well.
he was a godly man did a lot of good for this community.
I know he passed away when you were quite young so if you would ever like to hear more about your father, feel free to drop by my home for a visit.
he was a wonderful man.
you can be proud of him, son.
very proud.
come on, Roy.
wow, that was great, Mr. Sperry.
Yeah, you shut Nick up without even have to fight him.
no gentlemen, this is no time for rejoicing.
but Nick's a big jerk like that all the time.
I don't want to make an excuse for him, and he's hurting inside.
so tonight, when you go home, pray for Nick and ask the Lord to help him.
Lord, Mr. Sperry asked us to pray for Nick.
I don't really think he wants to be mean like he is, but if you could help him... thank you.
Amen.
a couple years after you were born, your father came to a revival service at a church I was attending.
and during that service, he came to realize that he was a sinner, like all of us, and he needed forgiveness for those sins.
so he prayed and he accepted Jesus as his Lord and savior.
he was born again.
you might not know what that means, Nick, but it's a spiritual birth in the Christian faith.
a lot of people thought it just a fad with your father, but it wasn't, it was real.
and his life changed dramatically.
you know what your father did?
he went to all the people he wronged and asked for forgiveness and then he did everything he could to make things right.
it was marvelous to see.
but, sadly, your Mom couldn't accept his passion for God, and she left a year later when you were about 4 years old.
but he became a good man, Nick, a really good man.
my mother didn't think he was.
well, that's because she didn't accept his Christianity and it came between them.
now I know it was tougher on you growing up than most young men.
but son, that's no excuse for your behavior.
if your father were still here,
I'm sure things would be a lot different for you right now.
Yeah, what makes you say that?
because you wouldn't have to go around and act like a bully to get attention.
you would have had your father here to give you the proper attention.
I'm sure of it.
and that's what I think is really bothering you.
your mother works all the time.
she's tired, I'm sure she's cross with you at times, you live in the same house but she goes her way and you go yours.
so you think you got me all figured out?
I may be old, Nick, but my eyesight is still pretty good and I can see a hurting heart.
the Lord Jesus is here for you, Nick, just like He was for your father.
just call out to Him.
you know the path you're on is the wrong one.
I shouldn't have ever come here.
Nick, my door is always open to you.
always.
can I talk to you for another minute?
sure.
what did you mean by "call out to him"?
well, it's really, quite simple.
just talk to him.
he's always there.
Hah!
what did you do that for?
I could have got hurt.
what do you mean?
you're suppose to ride on the other side of the road.
I am not.
you could have ruined my mower.
you do have a pretty nice mower.
what's this thing?
it's my gas cap, I need that.
Yeah, you're going to have to come and take it from me.
come on, give it back.
it's right here. Awww, it's over there.
come on guys.
got it right here.
give it back.
come on Benny.
come on, give it.
Ah, come on Roy.
come on Roy.
give it.
you're going to have to come and take it from me.
come on, give it to me.
you're not going to get it that way.
I don't want to fight you.
so, what are you going to do about it, huh?
give me the cap.
I said, what are you going to do about it,
huh? Huh?
give it back.
give him the cap.
Oh, hey Nick, we've been waiting for you.
Dustin here has been giving us a hard time.
give him the cap, Roy.
no way, it's my cap.
give him the cap, Roy.
what do you mean, Nick?
you do this stuff all the time.
like I said, you're going to have to come and take it from me.
Roy.
I said give him the cap.
okay Nick, I was just playing around.
here's your stupid cap.
come on, Benny, let's go.
you coming, Nick?
no.
I got something I gotta do.
Nick, thanks.
father in heaven, I come to you now on behalf of Nick.
God... Jesus...
I don't know what to say...
draw Nick closer to you, Lord.
I know you love him just the way you loved his father many years ago.
I'm sorry for the way I am.
I'm sorry for the way I treated Mr. Sperry and for picking on those kids at school...
I just, I just wish I could be normal.
I just wish I could change.
he needs you, Lord, like we all need you.
keep your arms around him and guide him...
Larry, come with me.
me?
come with me.
anything wrong, Nick?
come with me.
Oh, you want someone to cheer you on.
we can do that.
come on Tyler.
no.
you play.
huh?
you play.
have fun.
okay, honey.
I'm off to work.
okay.
do you have any lawns to mow today?
Yeah, one.
and then we go to Mr. Sperry's.
alright gentlemen, I want you to stand right here by that tree and I'm going take this five-dollar bill and place it right over here on this table.
would you like to have this five-dollar bill?
I bet you could buy a pretty good pizza with it.
probably an extra large.
I knew you'd be the first to answer him.
but, you're going to have to work together in order to get the money.
now one of you must be touching that tree at all times and the three of you must be holding on to each other at all times and if you can touch this bill, then it's yours.
you can do with it as you wish.
but if you can't, then it remains mine.
is that clear?
clear.
alright.
so we can never let go of each other.
that's right, you must be connected to each other at all times.
so now, we ready to try?
alright come on guys, we can do this.
okay, strategy.
mark, you hold onto the tree.
Albert, you go next.
okay come on.
stretch!
come on, get it.
okay, come on Dustin, stretch.
I'm stretching.
got to get wider legs.
come on Dustin, stretch.
I can't reach it.
it's too far.
it's impossible.
no, it is possible.
it's impossible.
I can't do it.
let me try then.
come on Albert.
I can't reach it.
it's too far.
come on Albert.
it's impossible.
Mr. Sperry, we need your help.
no, There is a way.
come on, keep stretching, he says there is a way.
I'm trying, it's too far.
come on Albert, stretch.
it's too far.
I can help.
Nick?
what are you doing here?
I asked him to stop by.
you, Mr. Sperry.
Yes, I did.
but why?
I think Nick has something here to tell you.
Albert, Dustin, Mark, I came here to see Mr. Sperry a couple of days ago and we talked.
he talked about how my father became a Christian.
then, I went home and I thought about it and, I prayed.
I prayed to Jesus.
I'm sorry for the way I treated you guys.
I know I've been a real jerk.
but, if you will give me a chance,
I think that we could be friends.
if you would just give me a chance.
I know Nick has hurt the three of you in the past.
but, if he is truly come to Christ, then the Lord has forgiven him just like he has forgiven you and I.
the Bible says if a man be in Christ, he is a new creation.
old things have passed away, all things have become new.
this is the new Nick.
we understand.
and if you are still interested in that five dollar bill, there's one more person here to help so perhaps now, there is a way.
alright guys, let's go for it again.
Nick, we need your help.
mark, grab onto the tree.
me, Albert then Nick.
alright guys let's stretch.
come on.
let's go.
come on guys.
a little more.
come on Nick.
a little more.
fingertips... fingertips.
come on Nick, you can do it.
almost there.
come on guys.
I can't stretch any further.
I'm trying.
a little more.
I got it! I got it.
Yeah. Good job guys.
now we can buy that extra large pizza.
thank you. - It's going to be good.
it's gonna be tasty.
now, you don't need to do that. No more.
I can do my own lawn now.
turn that off.
hi Mr. Barnes.
what did you say sir?
I said turn that thing off.
Oh don't worry, it won't take me long.
I'll do a good job.
and I want you to tell me once and for all who put you up to this.
I hope you started reading your Bible Mr. Barnes.
if you give it a chance, I think you'll like it.
now you listen to me.
thanks for letting me mow your lawn Mr. Barnes.
Hello?
Tanya's back.
she is?
I just saw her.
I went with my Mom to the grocery store and she was there.
she didn't see me though.
okay.
are you still going to try to ask her out?
Yeah, I want to.
she'll probably be working the lunch time shift tomorrow.
Yeah, okay.
thanks for telling me.
hey Dustin.
hi Tanya.
what can I get for you?
get?
Oh um.
how was your vacation?
it was good, we just got back yesterday.
so it was fun?
Yeah, we had a nice time.
that's good.
vacations are normally good.
did you want to order something?
no, not really.
I had written you a note and I am here to get my answer.
your answer?
Yeah, to the question I had written you in the note.
what note?
I had written you a note before you left on your vacation.
no, I never got a note from you.
are you sure? Yeah. It was the day
me, Mark and Albert... we ordered sundaes from you.
I left it right over there on the table.
you didn't get it?
I never saw it.
what did the note say?
it said?
I was gonna...
never mind.
maybe I'll just write you another one.
is there something you want to tell me?
ahh,
I'd rather put it in a note form.
okay.
see ya.
see ya.
so, as I was saying.
the next day the guy I had met came back down to the beach but this time he brought his freshman friend, the one that was with him the day before that saw me, but I never saw him.
so she never got it?
that's what she said.
well, that will explain somethings.
Yep.
you should have just asked her right then.
you know I was going to but Cindy was there.
was she nice?
Yes, she was pretty nice.
that's a good sign.
maybe she doesn't like Nick.
what are you going to do?
I think I'm probably going to write her another note.
why don't you just ask her.
I already told her.
she's probably going to be at the pizzeria tomorrow.
I'll drop it off to her after we're done with Mr. Sperry.
I don't want to bother her at the diner again.
you're going to give it to her in front of everyone?
Yep.
you got guts.
dear Tanya.
I think you are a very nice girl...
dear Tanya...
the scripture says the tongue is a fire full of deadly poison.
it's one of the smallest parts of the body, but it can do the most good or the most harm.
so be careful what you say.
use your words to bless people, not to criticize or gossip about them.
it's easy to put people down, anyone can do that.
but, you, be different, stand up with your kindness, show the love of Jesus in everything you say, or, in some cases, what you don't say.
okay, my friends.
let's close in a word of prayer.
then he left his rainbow teddy bear...
now remember gentlemen, our hot dog cookout is scheduled for
friday at five.
I've ordered 4 dogs for each of one you, so please bring your appetites.
alright boys,
Bye-bye.
see you there.
I won't eat lunch on Friday.
don't you dare do it...
Dustin, are you going down there and give Tanya the note?
Yeah, planning on it but first I going to go home and drop off my Bible.
okay, we will too and then we'll meet you there.
okay, when you guys get to the pizza place save us a table.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
alright.
Hi, Tanya.
Hi, Sally. - Hi.
hey guys.
we're just here waiting for Dustin.
he's on his way to talk to you, Tanya.
talk to me?
Yeah, he's going to ask you out.
Albert.
I didn't mean to tell you that part.
you got such a big mouth.
I'm sorry.
and Mr. Sperry was just saying to watch what you say.
I'm sorry.
how you going to turn him down?
stop, you're making me all pressured and stuff.
ha Ha Ha.
stop.
hey guys, sorry I'm late.
hey Dust.
well, she's here.
this is my chance.
Ahhh, Dustin.
here goes nothing.
Dustin. Wait.
hi Tanya.
Hi.
can I talk to you for a minute?
Umm，
sure.
Tanya, I want you to know I think you're a very nice girl and I've been thinking a lot about you.
look, Dustin.
so, I wrote you this note, it expresses my feelings better, 'cause I've never really done anything like this.
I hope you at least read it.
Thanks.
come on guys.
let's go.
let me see what he wrote.
hey give me that.
it's my note.
but I want to see it.
he wrote it to me.
let me see what it says.
I'm going to read it first.
ahh, come on.
Oh alright.
I'll read it to you.
dear Tanya.
I think you're a very nice girl
I also think you are cool.
I want you to know that something great has happened in my life.
I started reading my Bible everyday and praying to the Lord.
I've come to realize that I need Jesus in my life especially if I want to go to heaven.
so I just wanted to encourage you to start reading your Bible, in the Gospel of John.
I think it will help you too.
well, that's all for now.
your friend, Dustin.
PS: I am mowing lawns this summer so if you don't have a
Bible, I'll be glad to buy you one.
okay, Mrs. Farley.
Yeah, I'll be right over.
Bye.
mom.
that was Mrs. Farley on the phone.
I'm going to go over right now and help her clean out her attic.
she's going to pay me.
okay, honey.
then I'm going to go over Aibert's.
have fun.
jonathan Sperry was a God-fearing man, who loved life, who loved his family, who loved people.
but most of all, we know that Jonathan loved the Lord and touched all of us in some way with the love that he had for Jesus.
jonathan would tell us not to weep for him today but to rejoice, because he is now in the presence of his Heavenly Father.
I know it's hard for us because we miss our dear friend.
but if Jonathan were still here, I am sure that he would tell us to live on for Christ and most of all, to tell others what Jesus did for them on the cross at calvary.
and now dear Jonathan, as we lay your body to rest, we believe that Jesus has ushered you into heaven by his saving grace, and may your memory continue to speak to our hearts as we continue on our earthly journey.
the Lord be with us all.
we need to go honey.
Dustin, please try to eat something, you'll feel better.
no, I won't.
I know this has been hard for you the past few days but you have to start moving forward again with your life.
I'm not hungry, may I please be excused?
Dustin, there's someone here to see you.
I don't want to see anybody.
it's Mr. Barnes.
Mr. Barnes.
I'm sorry to bother the both of you.
it's no bother, Mr. Barnes, please come in, sit down.
let me get you something to drink.
no, this will be fine, It'll just take a minute.
Dustin, I want to ask if you will still mow my lawn?
I will pay you from now on.
you don't have to pay me, Mr. Barnes.
I enjoy mowing your lawn and talking to you.
I know it was Mr. Sperry who put you up to this.
and I can't let you mow my lawn anymore unless you let me pay you, are we in agreement?
you don't have to, Mr. Barnes.
are we in agreement?
yes sir.
fine, that's settled.
now, I know you are feeling sad about Mr. Sperry and all.
we all are.
if there was ever a Christian man in this town, it was Jonathan Sperry.
so, you come mow my lawn next week if you feeling ready.
yes sir, I'll be there.
Oh, I thought you might like to know
I been reading my Bible.
just like you said, Gospel of John.
reading all about Jesus.
that's great Mr. Barnes.
you got a nice boy there, ma'am.
nice boy.
now you keep talking about Jesus, you hear, Dustin.
some folks out there just might be listening.
I will.
thank you all.
good evening.
can you believe that Mom?
Mr. Barnes started reading his Bible.
Yes, isn't that wonderful.
in the Gospel of John.
and it's because of you.
I can't believe it.
Mr. Barnes.
Yes, that is surprising.
what's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
no, what's wrong.
aren't you happy Mr. Barnes is starting to read his Bible?
Yes, honey, that's wonderful like I said.
then, what is it?
Dustin, did Mr. Sperry ever tell you how his wife died?
Yeah, she died in a car accident.
but did he ever tell you how it happened?
no, he just said that it happened four years ago.
Dustin, that accident was caused by Mr. Barnes.
he had been drinking and he was the one driving the other vehicle.
Mr. Barnes caused that accident?
Yes.
and Mr. Sperry paid me to mow his lawn?
Yes.
Dustin.
always remember, the Bible is your friend.
and so am I.
keep living for Jesus.
jonathan Sperry.
hello.
mark.
Dustin.
we need to have a Bible study.
a Bible study?
Yeah.
like the ones we had with Mr. Sperry.
when?
as soon as possible.
you call Albert, I'll call Nick.
we'll get them to call the rest of the guys.
we'll meet at my house tomorrow afternoon at 2: 00 o'clock.
but who's going to lead it?
guys, I'd like to thank you for coming.
if you would please follow me, there's something I'd to show you.
look around, guys, and don't be afraid.
this is an important place to visit while you're still alive.
and listen.
I don't hear anything.
neither do I.
the Bible says it is better to go to a funeral than a feast.
you know why?
cause everybody dies one day and when you go to a funeral you think about it more.
lean closer to the tombstones.
closer.
and listen.
really listen.
I can't control when I go.
Katie, I gotta leave!
you stole money from my house and then you took it to your lab to analyze.
Yeah, and you've been lying to me, Danny.
get the hell out of my house!
the bill in question was not counterfeit, but a leaked prototype.
okay.
cabbie described his passenger as a stocky Caucasian male with short, blonde hair.
it's okay.
it's all right.
what's your name?
Emily, just hang in there.
I'll get you some help.
Hey!
Hey, you got a phone?
Hey, you.
I need you to find me a payphone.
well, I can watch her for a minute.
why don't you go for help?
it's him.
what?
it's him.
Hey, hey...
officer, we need your help.
we gonna play this game every night?
dude, you cannot shut me down, not your problem tonight.
officer, I found her in there.
creep's got the little girl right there. -What girl?
the little girl from the news everybody been looking for.
who did this.
Hey, hey, hey-- take it easy, sport.
check it out.
is your name Emily Kelso?
officer, this jerkweed tried to crash our party.
sir, we can take it from here.
you don't understand.
is Emthiskeily lso.
she went missing in '92.
she was never found.
she was gone for years.
I saw him try to run away with her, dude, totally.
just step away from the girl.
all right.
Emily, it's all right.
step away, now!
all right, all right.
hands on your head!
Hey, hey.
come on! Turn around. on the car
keep your hands on your head!
this is crazy.
I'm the one who found her.
you'll have plenty of time to explain yourself later.
listen to me.
he was here, the guy who did this to her.
let's get you out of here, kiddo.
you have to let him go.
he's not the bad man.
it's okay.
simply put, Mrs. Vasser, it's bad behavior.
what kind of bad behavior?
well, he disobeyed and talked back to his teacher.
and last week, we had to sit Zack out of recess twice for fighting other children, it's become a concern.
I'm sorry.
we'll address it.
you need to understand that if it becomes necessary, zack will be suspended.
okay.
are there problems in the home?
no, just that zack's had some trouble sleeping.
I mean, between you and your husband.
Oh, no.
we're getting along all right.
um, my husband's been traveling a lot.
and I went back to work.
wasn't Mr. Vasser supposed to be here today?
he got called away.
last minute.
well, odd behavior, unexplained absences-- those sound like his symptoms?
something like that.
could be schizotypal personality disorder.
Schizo?
I'm not saying he's schizophrenic. -Oh, that's a relief.
but what about his behavior?
is he hearing voices? Is he paranoid?
no.
what about delusions?
Yeah, you could call them that.
so he disappears for hours at a time, no explanation.
sometimes he puts himself or his family in danger.
most of the time.
well, you could always do a 51-50.
whoa, whoa-- take him in?
Yeah, well...
it's not like you have to send a bunch of guys after him with butterfly nets.
just set an appointment for him with a shrink.
give him the chance to go in voluntarily.
so you're saying he's a nut job?
I'm saying he could be sick.
then he can stay that way.
I'm done.
one of these has got to work.
Katie, I'd rather not talk about this one right now. OK?
okay.
how was the meeting?
Oh, you know, our kid's about to be suspended, and, uh, mrs. Murray is convinced we're unfit parents.
I don't know why.
you're having a lot of fun over there.
have I seen you guys here before?
no.
so I got her to let me be room mom, see if we can't straighten Zack out.
I'm sorry, I should've been there.
Hey, it is what it is.
Jack could get you out of these.
that's the last person I want to see me like this.
Yeah, I know, but, you know, you are going to have to talk to him at some point.
next topic.
hey...
uh, should we, uh...
keep these?
Yes, if they'll keep you home.
Mm-hmm.
Hey.
on us.
not my style.
you want Dan Vasser, talk to Dan Vasser.
you want to know about the stories he's working on, read the paper...
somebody should.
actually, I've conducted an impromptu audit of your pages in the last six weeks.
not a lot of Dan Vasser bylines to speak of.
well, he delivers when it counts.
well, from what I've gathered, he's been busy chasing the famous Dylan Mccleen.
we're pretty sure he tested airport security for the story.
there's no story.
he may have come into the stolen cash.
there's no story.
how do you know that?
because he told me there wasn't.
look.
we're both interested in the same thing here.
Oh, that's a good one.
you practice that in the mirror?
we want the truth.
Mr. Vasser is investigating a federal crime, an unsolved crime.
if we could share some of his sources, it would be good for both of us.
you get a scoop, I get a criminal.
Oh, you want sources.
why didn't you say so?
I realize it's an unorthodox request.
unorthodox and impossible.
Dan Vasser did a couple of weeks behind bars because he wouldn't name a source for a grand jury.
you expect him to give it up for you?
I was hoping for a little cooperation. That's all.
you're the feds.
you want his browser history, phone records, even his grocery list, take it without asking.
isn't that what you boys do these days?
you practice that in the mirror?
just made it up.
I overslept, sorry.
Hey, it's 8: 10.
why don't you have your shoes on?
I don't need them.
Yeah, you do.
put 'em on, buddy.
he hasn't eaten anything.
he doesn't like my pancakes.
since when don't you like mom's pancakes?
I want you to make me eggs.
okay, Zack.
about your behavior at home and at school?
you know the thing you got upstairs.
the thing with the weird handles.
you swing it around and the little Italian painters kill all those mushrooms?
it's called a Wii.
right, so guess what?
wii's not gonna see you for the whole "Wii-kend."
what?
Yes, so socks, shoes, then three bites-- go.
what time did he go down?
doesn't matter, he was up again at 3: 00.
couldn't get back to sleep for another hour.
that's the second time this week.
third.
has he talked to you at all about...
your vanishing act?
no, you?
no.
I got to go.
this guy kept a little girl behind a brick wall for three months.
whatever happened to her?
she's a foster kid.
social services placed her with a new family, but she ran away.
I tried to find her to write a follow-up, you know, after the other girl disappeared.
what other girl?
another foster girl.
went missing about a year later.
turned up dead.
what?
Oh, the whole thing was a huge black eye for the city.
which gave me a lot of bylines.
and which brings me to you-- is this going to be an actual story, or another one of your snipe hunts?
who's this?
Oh, yeah.
he was trying to move some abandoned buildings down in Soma.
he managed the place where they found her.
he was never a suspect?
Yeah, but the cops cleared him.
Why?
I don't remember.
he's no killer, though, just trying to make a buck.
he actually turned out to be a pretty good source.
I'll bet.
you're not saying this is the guy.
I'd have to know that for sure, wouldn't I?
it's not like I was there or anything.
Jack Vasser, please.
Rudy's working pio.
if you want a statement, talk to him.
I'm not here for a story.
I can't help you then.
I need you to question somebody.
I need a weekend in Cabo.
you see that happening?
come on.
Dan, forget it.
you want me to apologize? Is that it?
no, I know you wouldn't do that, because you're never wrong.
what I want you to do is see a shrink and get some meds.
I think I'd rather have that trip to Cabo.
you need help, Danny.
you're afraid.
afraid of what?
that I might be right.
that I might actually be telling you the truth.
you calling me crazy is your way of staying in denial.
you're a piece of work, you know that?
I knew this was a bad idea.
I thought maybe for a second you could put our crap aside and just be a cop.
I was wrong.
what?
what?
did you get chased by the cops in 1995 for passing a counterfeit $20 bill?
Yes.
Yes, it was a $20 from 2003.
the cabbie sicced a cop on me.
I barely outran him.
how did you know about that?
Yeah, if I remember...
the whole Emily Kelso thing took place a couple of blocks that way, but that place is long gone.
Yeah, you can't stop progress.
not if there's profit in it.
so just take me back to '92.
police report says there was a rave party that night.
did you know about it?
wish I had.
those people were in and out of my buildings all the time.
you try showing a space after they've trashed it.
I hear you.
so, why's this coming up now?
we review these cold cases every now and again. It's routine.
all right, well, listen, anything you need, just give me the word.
you got it, and if I do turn anything up, you'll be the first to know.
okay.
there you go.
piping hot.
you're a prince.
thank you.
Hey, lady, you forgot your paper.
your really old paper.
best in the city.
really delicious.
okay, so who are we looking for?
that was swell.
I don't see her.
there's no tourists around here.
when you're a runaway, you look for the easy mark.
let's try over here.
why not?
listen, I know stumbling through the past gets old real quick, but you did save this girl.
Yeah, from a kidnapper who's still a free man and got away with murder.
so how's that for irony?
that's part of the job description.
you know I saw you.
what?
past you, in '92, at a rave party.
yeah?
Yeah.
I vaguely remember that phase.
right before we met, right?
right.
you were something.
best thing about '92, beat the hell out of '48.
I guess stumbling through history hasn't been all that bad, right?
I stumbled on you, didn't i?
no, I want to finish this!
I want my full commission!
ten bucks per head.
I get half!
Hey, let her go!
I'm sorry, prince valiant.
you want to mind your own business?
no, I want to mind yours.
take a walk.
see the sights.
Thanks.
sure.
you're...
Yeah.
I understand.
got it.
thank you.
Hey, pace yourself.
it's hard.
how'd you find me?
I'd rather know how you stayed hidden.
social services lost track of you.
you trying to disappear?
I don't like anybody they put me with.
so how are you?
I know it's been a few years since it happened.
I put all that behind me.
good.
is that why you never identified the kidnapper to the police?
I couldn't remember what he looked like.
didn't really want to.
is there a bathroom I could use?
I'd like to clean up a little bit.
sure.
towels are under the sink.
so what happened to her real family?
these caworker said her mother terminated parental rights when she was three.
and the father?
San Quentin.
15 years left.
my god.
it's amazing she survived.
it's part of the skill set.
so how are we gonna play this?
well, my past self's at work. Your past self is what?
interning at the D. A.'S office.
that's perfect-- you can take her to social services, get her placed in a good home -what are you gonna do?
what she never could-- find the man who did this.
and what? Put a bullet in his head?
connect him to the crime. Alert the cops.
I don't know.
Dan, didn't you learn anything from the earthquake?
this is different.
you showed up at the park because you're supposed to help emily, not be running with a vendetta.
Bennett's gonna kidnap another girl, if he hasn't already.
then let it happen.
are you kidding me?
it's history, Dan, let it stay that way.
you're supposed to be following your...
instincts, right?
so what happens if I don't?
it never ends well.
what does that mean?
Liv, I'm gonna do this.
whatever happens, I can handle it.
Hey, this, uh, this lipstick is kinda neat.
it's like...
rich.
it's vintage.
I like y'all's place.
it's not really our place.
isn't this all your stuff up in here?
it's complicated.
wow, whole new you.
Yeah, figured I should tame the look.
well, you look good.
except...
I think that lipstick might have been a bad idea.
Yeah, you're probably right.
the more adorable the better.
I'm gonna find you a really good family.
Hey, long as they feed me, I can deal.
it's like Tupac says, "keep your head up," right?
Yeah.
I'm not, um, gonna have to testify or anything, right?
about the kidnapping?
well, you need to talk to someone, Emily.
it's the only way you're going to get past all of this.
I could...
if people would let me.
Hi, there.
Yeah, just checking in.
okay, all right.
that's fine.
see ya.
uh, I got his number, right.
that's good.
you call up Mark?
Anthony, that's now how we treat other living things.
he started it!
dude, it's a whole new operating system.
so far, it's way more simple, yeah.
everyone went out for tacos.
I'm just, uh, I'm just hanging.
I can't get enough of this online stuff.
they've got this thing, it's called, um, it's called a "chat room."
it's like those old 976 party lines, except it's not three bucks a minute or whatever.
Yeah, you meet people.
all kinds.
whoa.
Hey, look, I gotta go.
Yeah, okay, I will.
excuse me.
can I help you with something?
I was just... - You mind putting that down?
you don't remember me, do you?
uh, yeah, afraid not.
about three years ago, a little rave party about four or five blocks from here?
these listings, which one's got the next girl?
or haven't you found her yet?
that's why you're cruising the net, right?
No!
no...
well, yeah, of course it hurts.
you hit him pretty hard.
well, zack's missing.
I still don't feel good. My head hurts.
well, I'll get you some medicine.
you hungry?
you want grilled cheese?
can I still play the...
the wii?
no.
for how long?
we'll let your dad decide.
Zack, where are you?
Hey. Oh, dan, god!
how did you...
I just...
got here.
well, Zack's missing.
what? - He disappeared.
he-he said that his head was hurting, and then he...
vanished.
Zack, you in here?
come on.
Oh, my god.
what are you doing?
I'm sorry.
it's okay.
I thought if I could disappear, then you would have to come save me.
you would have to come find me.
I found you, okay?
I found you.
Yeah, I remember her.
my parents volunteered for the search for her when I was a kid.
but she turned up eventually, right?
Yeah, mystery man at the scene.
he pulled her from behind a brick wall.
and Dan thinks that this Bennett guy went on to kidnap another girl?
kidnap and murder.
micaela Martinez also a foster kid.
she turned up dead in 2001.
Oh.
that's horrible.
Dan says the Bennett guy was cruising internet chat rooms as far back as '95.
back when that stuff just started.
they keep internet records back that far?
I don't know.
well, I mean, how does Dan know?
I mean, have you...
seen his research?
if you want to say something, Theresa, say it.
yesterday, you thought he was suffering from delusions, and now it seems you're buying into them.
no, I'm not buying into anything.
I'm just helping him out.
well, he certainly needs it, right?
I mean, it's a big story.
what, you think he's making all this up just to get a scoop?
come on, you don't know my brother.
if you find anything in there, I'm buying lunch for the rest of the week.
well, leave a nice tip.
what?
Hello?
you don't answer your phones.
where the hell you guys been?
I've been trying to reach you for 20 minutes.
Hey, quality time with Zack.
why, what's going on?
put Dan on.
uh, he can't. He's just...
Katie, put Dan on now.
hon?
it's jack.
he's, uh...
he's acting like jack.
Thanks.
what?
okay, Micaela Martinez?
here's the thing.
her last foster parents, they were software designers.
they had a lot of computers in their place and they said...
she spent a lot of time in chat rooms.
Yes.
can you do something or not?
well, I can dig.
no matter how much I dig, I don't think I can get chat room logs that far back.
so you can't connect her to Bennett?
I'll do what I can.
either way, I'm putting his ass under surveillance.
okay. Good.
everything cool?
Katie didn't sound like herself.
Oh, Zack got suspended today.
suspended? - Yeah.
it's a long story.
I gotta roll.
all right, go.
Jack, thanks.
does this mean you're...
coming around on my...
condition?
I'm not gonna worry about that now.
I'm just gonna stick to good, old-fashioned police work and maybe we can bring this thing home.
Yeah.
then everything will be right with the world.
right.
okay.
this guy had a ride through the real estate boom like you wouldn't believe-- all condos.
if I know which buildings he sold, then I can figure out where he put the next girl.
your brother faxed that.
she was arrested a couple of years after I left her for dealing ecstasy.
I'm sure you'll change her life.
Katie, I'm sorry.
I know it's been a hell of a day.
Yeah.
listen, we need to figure out what's happening to you, Dan.
we need to figure it out so we can fix it.
maybe if I can help Emily, maybe if I help enough people, it'll stop.
maybe.
maybe isn't good enough.
I am trying to be strong, I really a but it's not getting any better.
it's getting worse.
thought I'd run into you.
ha. That's funny.
is this 2001? - Yeah.
then we don't have a lot of time.
Hey.
Hey, you guys, want some?
what are you selling?
happiness.
comes in a pill these days.
maybe you're not taking enough.
Oh, my god.
how did you...
what are you guys doing here?
you didn't stay with your foster family.
look, um...
I'm really busy right now, but it was good seein' y'all.
don't walk away, Emily, or you're gonna end up with a family you don't want.
those two?
SFPD.
narcotics division.
they ran a couple of stings in this park.
you were one of their biggest catches, Emily.
you talk about it like it's already happened.
Emily, you're still hurting.
you haven't let go of what happened to you, of what Aeden did to you.
leave me alone.
he's a monster.
he kidnapped you.
No!
he didn't!
what are you talking about, Emily?
I saw where he put you.
I met him on a 976 line.
I snuck out of the house to meet him.
that's how he got me.
that's why you didn't identify him to the police.
you were afraid they'd find out.
please, just...
what the hell is going on?
well, look who's still running the business.
do I know you?
don't you remember me?
am I supposed to?
Emily's coming with us.
I don't think so.
Hey, hey...
she's with us.
now, get outta here.
Wow. Where did that come from?
foster kid.
y-y-you can't do this.
I have no place to go!
Livia's gonna to get you back to your foster family, trust me.
Emily, you don't have to worry about Aeden Bennett anymore.
Dan... - I need the car.
are you hungry?
get a soup, and give us a second, okay?
we're doing this again?
there's another girl.
she ended up dead, but it was later.
it was now, 2001.
she's not your mission. - Listen to me.
I know which condo he's building right now.
I know where Bennett is keeping her.
Bennett's not the issue. - How do you know?
whatever's doing this to us didn't stop me from finding him in the present.
even Jack thinks there's a connection.
Oh, Jack's helping you?
Dan, you are taking this way too far.
I am not going to let her die.
now give me the keys.
it won't end well.
Why?
tell me why.
cause you'll start to change something you're not supposed to change.
like what?
just trust me, Dan.
don't go off the rails.
you know what Katie said to me just now?
just now, just before I got here?
"it's getting worse," she said.
worse.
my life is slipping through my hands, and you're talking about some kind of order to all this-- all I see is chaos.
that's because you're blaming yourself.
what?
you're blaming yourself for Zack and Katie and you've no other way to take out your anger, so you're taking it out on Bennett!
do I get the car or not?
Hey, buddy.
you're supposed to be getting some shut-eye.
the universe is a crazy place, huh?
maybe one day we'll make sense of it.
no, no, no, no.
no.
no, no, no.
you gotta stay asleep, gotta go to sleep.
or daddy's gonna get caught.
and make a real mess of everything, you know?
Hey.
I am...I'm there...
I'm headed there.
you left with her. - Right.
I just forgot her present.
there's some, uh, prep involved.
and, Martha, uh...
I was never here, all right?
okay. - Great.
Thanks.
whe is she?
six years just flewy, right?
just a guy with a crowbar.
I found you.
Hey, baby.
what's the matter, you can't sleep?
you worried about dad?
Yeah.
do you get mad at him?
I don't know.
well, sometimes I worry about him, too.
come here.
and you know, sometimes I get mad.
but I miss him.
but then I realize that dad's job is important.
Why?
I don't know.
I think because he helps people.
like who?
I think that's one of those answers that maybe you're not old enough to understand.
maybe I'm not even old enough to understand it.
but he'll come home.
he always does.
nice work.
how's Emily?
I talked to her case worker who spoke with the last family she was with.
they're going to help her out until she can get an apartment.
is that Hugh?
Yeah, I called him up, gave him the tip.
listen, back at the park...
don't apologize.
you got a right to be steamed.
this thing we do, it's not an exact science.
is it even a science?
it happens.
just like the bumper sticker says.
I hope you're right about this one.
well, time will tell.
looking through my greatest hits, or just wallowing in your own inadequacy?
this is a pretty big scoop for you, isn't it?
got a tip in the middle of the night.
never did figure out who it was.
some tip.
Oh, I remember it.
Bennett was P. O. D.
kept ranting about how some guy set him up, tied him up for the cops.
well, that's gotta suck.
well, I guess the hoosegow set him straight.
did six years on a ten-year sentence.
got out a couple of months ago on good behavior.
heard he went to Thailand.
nice.
so how does this fill my pages?
it led me to a think piece on the Soma district.
15 years ago, it was all abandoned warehouses and rave parties, crime-ridden, all that...
now it's an ocean of condos.
overpriced, overbuilt, straining the resources.
is that progress?
I got a couple of city council members who think not.
mm, a piece like that is gonna make it hard for the sales jerks to move condo ads.
Yep.
I like it.
when do I get it? - Tomorrow.
right now I'm taking my kid for a haircut.
whatever.
see, Livia?
I was right.
Hey.
you got a second?
barely. What's up?
I just, uh...
I've been thinking about what's been happening with you
going back in time and seeing Livia...
right.
can I call you tomorrow?
I'm sorry, I got...
what are you doing?
we should talk.
it's a business card for a shrink, Jack.
Yeah, she's good.
she handles most of our edp's.
emotionally disturbed persons, Jack?
I set an appointment tomorrow morning.
I thought we moved past...
what?
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god, we never talked about Bennett.
who's Bennett?
we never had those conversations.
you never questioned him - what the hell are you talking about, Jack? -Because I sent him to prison six years ago, Jack.
I changed the time line... - All right, don't start.
I changed history, Jack, including yours.
you're sick.
okay, but you're also my brother.
you have an appointment at 8: 00 a. M.
I'm calling the doc at 8: 05-- if you haven't shown, I'm going to file a 51-50
and force you into 72 hours of court-ordered supervision.
okay, I got it.
I got it.
thank you.
can I go now?
has he talked to you at all about...
your vanishing act?
no you? - no.
I need to get back.
there's a felon in my house, I'm worried about Katie and Zack coming home.
I shouldn't have gone off-road to get Bennett arrested.
you're going to be tested, Dan, you have to be ready.
now, you listen to me, Katie you don't need him, you are a strong woman and you don't need anybody expect yourself - who are you? - Is me
No! I am sorry, Is not - I went to your funeral. - You deserve a long explanation,
what, you're worried that if Dan's crazy I might be crazy, too?
no. I'm worried about our child.
hello. - Dan?
yeah? - It's Elliott Langley.
are you finding that other people are interested in your work?
as a matter of fact, yes.
a person wielding that kind of power would be very valuable. Right?
do you think time travel is possible?
until you prove to me you can or can't, I don't know.
my sister's coming tomorrow, remember.
hard to forget that.
you think you guys can play nice for a couple of days?
you know I will.
that your Christmas present?
Yeah, you know, I've read the manual three times now.
I can't seem to figure it out.
you should give it to Zack. Maybe he can help.
Hey!
seriously, he's a whiz with my laptop.
you dare to doubt me?
okay, that needs to be erased.
what? No. - Yes.
I'm gonna post it on the web.
you want to take pictures?
Yeah.
fire away. - Oh, yeah?
um, how 'bout we make a movie?
okay, let's remember, there's a child in the house.
if this should get into the wrong hands...
Ooh!
erase, erase... - no.
Hey, come on. Give me that.
don't...
move!
who is he? - I don't know.
stop!
okay, what's going on?
we just crashed!
what? Where, into a boat?
no, I think onto the edge of a cliff.
okay. Wow.
I think I'm the only thing keeping us on land right now, so I'll just stay here.
you two move towards the back door here, one at a time.
uh, the boy first. Come on.
Christopher, go.
mom, you go first.
no, you!
somebody.
okay, please, come on.
we're gonna get you out of here.
the more weight we move to this end the better, all right?
Chris, come on. You first.
not without my mother!
you save your mother by moving first.
now come on!
come on.
mon get out there
come on.
I can't move.
what's your name? - Sandra.
Sandra, you can do this, all right?
you can do it. Come on.
just take my hand.
that's it.
that's it.
that's it. Go!
Hurry!
no oh, god!
Ow!
you know, if the stairs are a problem, we have elevators.
Thanks.
Yes, therapy.
no, - I'm not joking around.
I mean, you know, I'm a believer now.
I can see that traveling all the time could take a mental toll on you.
and who would I go to for therapy, Jack?
a specialist?
maybe you could say you travel all the time and leave the slaughterhouse - five stuff out...
or not. Whatever.
I need Garrity's file.
you said that he might have been tracking other people like me?
if there's a file, then it might shed some light on, you know, what's going on.
okay, well, I'll see what I can do, but we're talking the FBI.
Thanks. Nice.
dude, I need to talk to you about something else.
it's about Theresa.
Hey, can I get you some wine?
Oh, no, thanks.
it's the tail end of a cold. - Oh, okay.
so, how is she?
Oh, Annette's here!
Hey!
what?
Oh, it's cool. It'll wait. - What?
pour me a dirty Martini or I may strangle someone with my bare hands.
gin, not vodka.
coming up. - Hey, woman!
my god, it's like hugging a pretzel stick.
Theresa, may I introduce the reason that I was in therapy at the age of four?
this is Annette. - It's nice to meet you.
pleasure. - And of course...
how are you, Annette? - Hello, Hugh. I'm fine.
I'm just a little frazzled.
you know, it is getting worse trying to drive around this town.
well, the whole city grid was designed by gold rush drunks.
Hugh, can't your gays work that out?
my gays? - Danny.
how are you feeling?
I'm stronger, thanks. How are you?
I'm well, considering 36 hours ago I was peeing into a mud hole outside of chindu,
I'm pretty damn good, thanks.
inspector.
thank you.
and the girl has a pulse once more.
shall we move in here?
Hey, Dan, do you have the camera?
uh, no.
so how long you here?
Oh, just a couple of days.
I've got a conference up in Montana this weekend.
Where's my nephew?
aunt Annette!
there he is, my favorite nephew!
and you can tell your other cousins that I said that. - Okay.
Hey, want my olive?
Yuck! Tastes like gasoline.
Yeah, well...
Oh, damn it.
help you?
thank god, it's you.
I'm thanking god it's me, too.
will you help me, please?
uh, yeah.
here.
what?
Ha-ha.
let me ask you something.
if I accidentally left something significant behind on one of the trips, would that cause problems?
well, it depends. What'd you lose?
uh, a digital camera.
Oh, new technology?
never good to leave behind.
has anything changed?
uh, not that I can tell.
maybe no one found it.
going public has its upside, - maybe.
of course, but the bad news is Senfel systems now joins other silicon valley companies that are becoming a popular target of corporate espionage.
that's why from now on, you must carry this badge at all times.
and it's not just the private sector preying on success...
that's her. That's my target.
also beware of executives from foreign companies who approach you claiming to be a startup.
they can be fronts for foreign spies.
okay, then, thank you for your time.
Oh, my god, you're alive!
Hey, Christopher, look. Remember this guy?
he saved our lives.
Oh, you got out!
Hey, uh, mom, can we go now?
I'm supposed to meet some guys at the park.
honey, did you hear the part where I said,"he saved our lives"?
give me five minutes. - Okay.
Hey, thanks for saving our lives and everything.
mm, no problem.
I'm going back to school.
we're moving to Santa Cruz.
but relax, I won't be driving.
by the way, what were you doing in our camper that night?
I was just driving by.
saw the accident, stopped by to help.
what are you gonna be studying?
painting.
I don't really fit in here.
everybody's looking for the next wave; the miracle chip, the fastest microprocessor.
I guess I'm still a hippie at heart.
what about Christopher?
well, he's kind of aimless now.
Oh, please, start eating.
Where's Dan?
uh, he was called away; a story.
he was?
first time in a month.
Yeah, there's a big drug bust down at the pier.
I should get going there, actually.
couldn't say good-bye?
he didn't want to make a fuss.
Couscous? - Oh, yes, please.
excellent. - Theresa?
what kind of medicine do you practice?
I'm an er doctor.
I practice medicine in the er.
that's great.
how long have you two been dating?
Uh...four months.
that's a long time.
so you finally found a woman who doesn't want to bear your children, huh, Jack?
Yeah.
took a while.
can I have the...? - Pass the bread down.
the concentration of photosites are incredibly dense.
converting and compressing this much data...
I mean, we have to be talking about a 32-bit microprocessor, which is inconceivable for something this small.
japanese, of course.
Yeah, it even does 30 seconds of movies.
I'm Dewey. - Christopher.
uh, where did you say you got this?
from me.
I think you found my camera.
no, it's mine.
I found it. - Yeah. You found it at the crash site.
is that true, Chris?
I don't want this to be a big deal, but that is my camera, and I want it back.
Chris? - It's mine, mom. I found it at school.
did you try to return it, honey?
it fell out of my pocket, all right?
look. Leave him alone, okay?
if he says it's his, it's his.
do you really want to get into this?
maybe not.
thank you.
that's not yours.
thank you.
you'll have to leave the building.
Hey.
sorry. I had to step out.
Yeah. Heard you were on a story.
everything okay?
they put the fire out?
Yeah, they did.
well, you missed a great dinner.
Hey. - You're back.
sorry I had to leave like that.
it's okay. Come here.
kid in bed?
Yeah. Waiting for you to say good night.
good night, daddy.
who's this?
Where's Zack? - Who?
Zack. - What's going on, Dan?
where is our son?
what son?
Dan, what's wrong? Are you okay?
I don't know my daughter's name.
what?
you don't know Caroline?
that was the name we liked for a girl.
okay, you're starting to scare me.
I'm way past that.
and I think you're frightening your daughter.
you have no memory of us having a son?
what?
it's one thing that you can't take her anywhere alone, it's one thing that she's seen you disappear, but now you say you don't know who she is?
she saw me disappear? - Yes.
you remember everything?
me leaving the 747?
Yes, yes, yes. - Dylan Mccleen's hijacking money?
everything else is the same.
Hey.
Hi, Caroline. - Hi.
listen...
I just had a really rough day, you know?
I made you this in school.
it's a butterfly.
thank you so much.
um, mommy and I, we just need a minute to talk, okay?
yeah?
okay I need to ask you about a night eight years ago.
okay.
it was spring 2000, and it was, like, our fourth date, and it was the first time we went to the giants game, and it was cold, and we were under that blanket.
do you remember that? - Yeah.
my hands were trying to keep you warm, your hands were keeping me warm, and we both got, you know, excited, and we left the game in the seventh inning 'cause we couldn't wait to get home to have sex.
now, I drove through red lights.
we were kissing while I was driving.
we ran into that apartment and...
we didn't slow down. We just...
we didn't even make it to the bed. - No.
nine months later, our son was born. - No.
his name is Zack! - No, Dan. No
we went to see the Giants, and you left early.
what?
the paper called you in because the new, uh...
Nanotechs crashed at the register, and you lost the story you were working on.
nanotechs?
your computer at the register.
you went to work, Dan.
Caroline was conceived around that time, but it wasn't after a baseball game.
okay.
okay. Uh...
I need to get our life back tomorrow.
what?
are you done?
don't you change anything.
of course not. This is our family.
I wouldn't change a thing.
morning.
Ah, hey.
Hey. Sleep in?
Oh, tough night.
that Annette sure is an original.
Yeah. That's one way of saying it.
so you left to cover a drug heist story, and there's nothing about it on...
the Hennessey trial preview. I wanted to get a jump on it.
and I have five days with my sister-in-law so, yeah, I bailed.
Yeah. And left us behind to mop up.
this just came off the wire.
Hennessey's defense team leaked the deposition.
what am I supposed to do with that?
uh, read it, download it, I don't know, but it might help your story.
uh, sorry.
Thanks.
whoa.
morning. - Morning.
Caroline okay?
Yeah. Why?
I don't know. Her father's off his rocker?
he's not.
he's just been through some stressful things lately.
he always come and go at night as he pleases?
he's a reporter.
I'm lucky if I get him for dinner three nights a week.
okay.
you think he's having an affair.
I think he's a Vasser.
I trust him.
Hugh? - Yeah?
how long ago did we get the nanotechs?
seven, eight years ago. Why?
Oh, just curious.
Wow.
what about you?
what about me?
you're standing where a man was murdered a month ago.
can't be business as usual for you.
I know someone who could help you.
help me do what?
find some perspective.
get some clarity.
is that what I need?
you'll see your future roll out in front of you like a long stretch of desert road.
you'll be able to avoid the potholes.
what is he, a psychic?
Yes, she is.
Hello, Mrs. Cupper.
this is Dan Vasser from the San Francisco Register.
I was wondering if I could talk to you about your late son.
that's too bad.
please, don't hang up.
I didn't want to play this card, but I saved your life a long time ago.
you crashed your RV with your son in it.
Yes! Yes. I'm Dan.
Yeah, I did get thrown out of the place where you worked, but listen, I...
I want to help you.
please?
not bad shooting for a guy who sang men's chorale.
you think you can beat it?
Aw, you really want me to humiliate you in front of your buddies?
how's Garrity's family?
they were divorced.
he was a loner.
it's sad, really.
Yeah, it is.
so, listen... - can't do it, Jackie.
Jack, it's from the top.
all right, listen to me.
my brother was the subject of an illegal investigation.
I'm the only thing standing between this bureau and a federal lawsuit.
and don't think he doesn't have a strong case.
you got a rogue FBI agent looking for time travelers, Gus?
I mean, how's that gonna play in D. C?
Jack, we're friends.
I'm the one who confirmed that Garrity was rogue.
and this is how you thank me?
by threatening us with a lawsuit?
we just want to know what Garrity knew.
he was a nut and it got him killed, man.
if he'd been doing his job, he'd be alive today.
that's what you should do, Jack. Do your job.
ten minutes looking at his files you sit right next to me.
or we flip the switch.
thank you, counsel, we'll make sure that that's off the record.
Bye.
Dan Vasser? - Yeah.
how did you know I was...?
you have a very distinctive voice.
uh, please sit.
you know, you didn't have to come down here.
I-I could have come to you.
I don't like people to know where I live.
right.
how did you lose your eyesight?
diabetic retinopathy.
I'm sorry, I know you wanted to paint.
I took bart and three buses to get here, Dan.
you don't have to see to paint.
it's just that particular dream died with my son.
I'm sorry about Christopher.
he just disappeared?
Yes.
he went out one night to meet a friend and never came back.
could he have run away?
he would never leave me.
my eyes were going, he...
I understand if you don't want to talk about it.
I'm sorry, I have a dentist appointment.
what is it you want?
my son back.
you've lost a child? - Yes. Sorry.
never mind.
I'm sorry.
did Christopher have any enemies?
no.
but only a few friends.
someone who worked with you around that time.
his name was Dewey or something.
he worked at Senfel right around the time Christopher disappeared.
Dewey. - Yeah.
but what does all this have to do with your son?
do you think the same person took them?
no. Not quite like that.
tell me about Dewey.
christopher used to spend hours hanging around the office, waiting for me to get off work.
Dewey was young, Christopher looked up to him.
they loved computers.
so what happened to Dewey?
I don't know.
started his own company, I think.
did quite well.
there.
let's see.
Oh...beautiful.
thank your aunt.
thank you, aunt Annette. - You are welcome, my dear.
this comes from the finest children's shop in Hong Kong, so don't forget to tell all your friends.
Oh, don't give her any ideas, it's competitive enough out there.
one of the upsides of having a boy.
so go for it.
we were, but I don't think it's going to happen for a while.
why not?
not a good time.
there's still talk of layoffs at the paper.
Oh, Dan, could get work anywhere.
the internet is where it's all going, anyway.
Yeah, but Dan likes to get ink on his fingers.
you sure it's not because he works so much?
maybe.
Well...?
then pull the goalie from the net.
Dan does want a boy.
and, lately, I've been thinking about it, too.
I don't know why.
what's a goalie?
nice job.
have you heard of any of these people?
no.
were there other people Garrity was investigating?
you got two more minutes.
can I take this? - No.
you should really rethink that.
all I really do is read energy.
okay.
the future is nothing more than many little bits of the present strung together.
so by reading your energy in the present, we can get a clearer picture of where you're headed.
the seven of wands.
a time of great opportunity.
this card says you'll succeed at whatever you do.
you know what, my husband is actually coming home soon, so...
Katie, can't rush this.
it's okay.
you're anxious.
I understand.
this last one is called a "significator."
this is basically the essence of the entire reading.
sorry.
Uh-oh. What?
it's a big card, that's for sure.
something's falling apart in your world.
a situation under this roof, am I right?
there was an unfortunate event here about a month ago, yes.
the hanged man is about being suspended.
your life has been turned upside down.
you wouldn't be here if it wasn't.
so I'd call that a lucky guess.
something very profound is happening here.
something bigger than you or any of us.
the challenge is that you have absolutely no control over it.
so what should I do?
the cards don't predict the future.
they only illuminate.
the answers are always within.
Georgina Conrad, this is my brother-in-law, Dan.
Hi. - You're home.
Oh, my god.
I've never felt anything like it.
so, who is she?
a psychic.
Oh, Katie, come on.
you've lost something.
you're looking for something you lost.
it's small, but important.
something very small that has changed your world in a very significant way.
you're looking in the wrong place, Dan.
it's not where you think it is.
what isn't? - You have to find it.
find what?
honey, stay upstairs.
if you could give me your birthday that would help.
july 6, 1972. - Okay, I think we're done here.
Katie, come on. - Annette, get her out of here.
okay. - Katie, it's okay.
no, it's not okay.
it's not okay, Dan.
I won't do anything to disrupt your life, all right?
this is scaring me.
I saw the file.
all right.
it's lot of names... Diana Bloom, Neal Gaines...
it's got incident reports.
I mean, they wouldn't let me copy anything down, but...
I made a copy of the picture.
I recognize you, but who's the guy?
who's Elliot Langley?
a scientist, studies physics.
do you remember this picture?
no.
but I know who took it.
dad? - Yeah.
you've reached Elliot Langley.
it's Dan Vasser.
we've spoken in the past.
maybe you remember me.
I need your help.
I don't know where else to turn, Dr. Langley.
you seem to have some insight.
I need to get back.
you need to help me get my son back, Dr. Lang...
leave a message. - Damn it!
are you mad?
Yeah. Sorry.
I shouldn't have talked like that.
do you want to know what I do when I'm mad?
what?
sometimes I scream.
and sometimes I think of red licorice.
red licorice?
see, it works.
come here.
Hey, uh, honey, I need to go now.
where?
come on, baby.
come say good night? - Yeah, sure.
how bad is it?
Zack's gone.
what do you mean?
I erased my son.
Oh, my god. How?
wait, the camera?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm sorry.
so there's the boy that had the camera.
someone killed him for it.
I think maybe the friend that worked with him.
we get the camera back, you get your son back.
we can do this.
we have to.
I need to get home, too.
everything all right?
Henry wants to get married this weekend.
Why?
because he got drafted into the army.
what are you gonna do?
marry him.
I hope you're happy, Liv. I mean that.
I know you do.
there.
say good night.
good night, auntie Annette and uncle Jack.
good night, sweetie.
right here. Thank you.
well, I have to get up early so I'm gonna hit the sack, too.
okay, I'll lock up.
all right.
good night, guys. - Good night.
sleep tight - good night!
all right. Well, I should hit it.
Oh, come on.
bar's open.
Yeah, I would, I'm trying to cut back.
why not?
I never liked you, Jack.
okay, then. Cheers.
for how you treated my sister.
how you talked to her in public sometimes.
how you said you wanted kids, and then you didn't,
but despite all that, I'm still wondering.
if my sister married the right brother.
she did.
so...
what's the deal with Dan?
is he gambling again?
no. He's not gambling.
Annette, he loves Katie.
he's just, he's on the road a lot.
in fact, Dan's not even the most messed-up Vasser of the week.
Really? Who is?
Really? - Yeah.
Why?
I knocked up my girlfriend.
thank you.
Oh, your life is so over.
it's so strange that you live alone.
Yes.
in four different houses.
Oh...
what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
you got any ideas?
uh...Well, make the decision that's best for you and...
that will be...
the best for all.
and don't do it tonight.
I gotta bail.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
what's with you guys?
I came for the camera.
sure. - You got $10, 000?
is that what Dewey's gonna pay you?
I can't afford that.
I got a better offer.
well, then, fine. I'm done here.
I don't have a choice and you know it.
look, you're making a big mistake, man.
he's right, Christopher.
hitch your wagon with this guy.
I don't have time.
there's no scenario where he's gonna let you leave the building with his camera.
she's right.
I need it more than you, Chris.
and I need the money. - For what?
my mom.
she's diabetic.
she's losing her eyesight.
why do you think we crashed that night?
she's not gonna be able to keep her job.
she needs health insurance.
believe it or not, I still need it more.
it's just a camera.
it's not just a camera.
it's advanced technology, and people would kill to own it.
I mean, why do you think someone's willing to pay so much money for it?
look, you're on your own.
you know what your mom would want more than her eyesight?
her son. Alive.
give him back his camera, Chris.
come on.
who do you guys work for?
give it back!
don't worry, they will.
I have unauthorized personnel on level four.
what's going on?
they're trying to steal my camera.
sir, give the boy back his camera.
you're head of security, correct?
Yes. - Yet you're working graveyard?
you volunteered for this shift?
who's gonna buy this?
another company in the valley or some foreign government?
what are you talking about?
is this your buyer, Chris, or just the middleman?
I said, give him back his camera.
or you'll do what?!
go ahead.
call the cops.
you underestimate how seriously we take corporate espionage.
and you underestimate how much I want what's mine.
you have to come with us.
if he wants to stay, then let him. Come on.
Chris, is your mother around?
no.
just wait.
let them get outside away from the cameras.
wait in my car.
job done. We can go now.
Yeah. - Can we ever control it?
no, I haven't yet, but let me know when you do.
what are you watching?
uh, some kid I used to know.
he and his partner invented an occular implant.
riveting.
actually, it is, since we're about five years away from possibly giving sight to the blind.
thinking about going to Tatdich's for lunch. You want to go?
uh, no, I'm gonna go home for lunch today. Thanks.
okay.
Hey, you hungry?
starved.
why don't you let me do it?
I'll make my tuna Dijon on sourdough.
sounds fantastic, if only I had any of those things.
turkey on wheat?
sure. Fine.
you and Jack have fun last night?
uh...We did.
you know, it's too bad you got to him first.
I would've liked to have taken him for a spin.
go ahead.
situation couldn't get any weirder.
you know, I like Theresa, but I don't think it's gonna last.
wouldn't be so sure.
I think I know Jack.
Really?
I think I know Theresa's pregnant.
you got any cheese?
pregnant?
he told you and not me?
well, you and Dan, for whatever reason, are a little self-absorbed.
Where's Zack? - Right here.
Uh...dad.
what? - You're squeezing all the blood into my head.
sorry. Sorry.
what you drawing?
it's great.
how are you?
Theresa's pregnant.
okay. Did I cause that?
God, I hope not.
what a bizarre marriage.
who is it?
it's Georgina.
hello.
can we help you?
I've, um, I've done your birth chart, Dan.
it's...
remarkable. Phenomenal.
really.
you were born during an occurrence called the Joseph-Lee comet.
it's quite rare.
and not very well known except amongst metaphysicians, who believe it's...
mystical.
it's only happened twice in the last 100 years.
so, when was the other time?
march 3, 1923.
Dan, isn't that...? - March 3 is Livia's birthday.
I'm gonna be late for dinner tonight.
Why?
I'm sorry to bother you.
I can't seem to get you to return my calls.
yes?
um...
this is you and me.
now, my father took this and...
I remember where now.
it's when we went to NASA and...
you were working there, right?
I was.
so, what's going on, Dr. Langley?
I have to ask you a question.
sure.
who are you? - Pardon?
do you know this man, doctor?
I've never seen him before in my life.
you're kidding, right?
another one, huh?
so it seems. - Come back in.
we'll have him outta here in no time.
wait a minute.
this is 310.
we have a nonstudent loitering at the science building.
I can't control when I go.
who's the lucky woman who got my fiance?
so if it feels like a dream, then maybe it's something you're doing to yourself.
the MRI didn't find anything, but maybe it's something else.
Katie, I'm going back.
I can feel it.
Katie? - Yeah.
Jack's Katie?
did he tell you he saw Livia? It's interesting.
don't you think that whatever he's doing takes him right back to her?
what happens if you're traveling and you die? Do you come back dead?
I'm not gonna die.
I'm doing some research. - On what?
tachyons. - Tachyons?
particles that travel faster than the speed of light.
Livia knows what you do. - Livia does what I do.
welcome back.
I'm not trying to break you and Katie up, Dan. You're doing fine by yourself.
where you been?
what is that in your pocket?
and I'm not in the mood for a punch line.
don't worry. It's...
you can't keep going on like this, Katie.
it's complicated, Jack.
what else?
Oh, we need lemongrass and artichokes and heirloom tomatoes.
Lemongrass? - Yeah, I know.
mom's decided that we can't eat anything out of boxes or tubes anymore.
what about ice cream sandwiches?
she stops those, we're moving on.
sorry
who's he with?
doesn't matter. It's Jack.
she'll be somebody else next week.
Hey, Jack. - Hey.
what are you doing here?
apparently, my diet's lethal.
too many donuts, that it?
time to let the Holster out?
Oh, sorry. Theresa Sanchez, this is Katie, Dan.
nice to meet you up there.
Jack talks about you all the time.
Oh, really? Well...
so, how'd you guys meet? - In the er.
I'm stitching a guy up while he's taking a statement.
dream date.
you know me. I'm all about the romance.
Oh, yeah, yeah. - Cheese guy's here.
Oh, I love him.
Oh, so cheese is okay, just not cheesecake?
awesome.
cool.
how do they do that?
practice, buddy.
can you do that?
no.
Zack, listen to me.
we got to go, all right? - Not yet!
we got to find mom, all right?
got to find mom.
dad, my hat!
dad?
dad?
dad?
my god.
you are awful!
Jack, you seen Dan? - No.
he was just here.
he's pretty good at evaporating these days.
Yeah. Zack's with him.
I can't reach him on my cell. - Take it easy. How far could he have gone?
I don't know.
do you have any idea where they were heading?
no.
I think Zack might be separated from his father.
Hey, it's Vasser.
I'm at the corner of Collingwood and market. I got a priority 807.
don't worry. We'll find him.
is something going on?
my brother.
Where's my case?!
what? - Black plastic case!
you know where we are?
I don't even know when we are.
where is he? - Upstairs.
Where'd you go, Dan?
I got sick. Vertigo or...
what, you fall into the bay? - Jack...
why didn't you call? - Jack, stop.
come on! Lost his son in a public place, he can't call his wife and tell her?
look at him!
how can this be okay with you?
what the hell's going on here?
last week you had a handgun at a fundraiser.
Jack, this is a family matter. - Yeah, and he's my brother.
what the hell's going on?
Jack, we have a problem and it's serious and it's personal, and right now I just need you to trust me, okay?
okay. - Thank you.
wow, you, you've made enabling an art form, Kate.
we got careless, both of us.
Zack was terrified. He just...
how do we do this...
with you just vanishing? - I don't know.
right now, I just got to go and talk to Zack, okay?
Dan, clean up first.
I'm sorry about leaving you today.
where did you go?
I-I got sick.
got dizzy and I lost you in the crowd.
I thought you could see over people.
I can usually.
what's this, bud?
I'm making a sign for the 'niners game so mom can see us on TV.
all right, yeah.
want to help me?
I'd love to.
tomorrow after work, all right? - Okay.
I bought the tickets six months ago.
I promised him we'd go together.
well, things are a little different now.
I know, but this doesn't seem like the time to tell him that we can't go.
he's seven, Kate. He's not gonna understand any of this.
honestly, being seven might help.
1. 5% this quarter?
this month.
wait a minute. Down 1. 5 points of circulation this month alone?
that's a precipitous decline.
Precipitous?
that's a free fall, gentleman.
John, what's going on with the buyout of the senior reporters?
everyone's come forward.
we're pretty lean right now.
we're not lean enough. I see a whole lot of people running around out there.
Yeah, doing their jobs.
I don't doubt that they are, Hugh.
but you don't care.
and any additional cutbacks will leave us open to age and discrimination lawsuits.
Oh, yeah, and weaken the paper.
the one that got away
here we go.
1975.0
you got to like a guy who's got the bag to hijack a plane and bail out with a hundred grand.
no, you really don't.
so why you looking him up? - Story.
you got something on him? - Maybe.
cause that'd be huge.
Dylan Mccleen's just the name he brought the tickets under.
nobody knows who he really is. - I know that, Jesse.
you need any help? - What?
I'm a floater.
research a tattoo for me:
lightning bolt, star on the left, sun on the right.
see what you can find. - You got it.
this newspaper's bleeding, Hugh.
ad revenues are down 15% for the year.
internet has decimated our classified section and we have some reporters here who only file a couple times a year.
we're not vanity fair.
newspapers are never profit machines, Lane.
you want to make money, invent a search engine.
and that 1. 5 is better than last quarter.
what about Vasser? - What about him? He works hard.
and he's expensive.
Hey, you want to hurt this paper, get rid of Dan Vasser.
I don't want to hurt the newspaper.
I want to keep it running.
that's an army ranger tattoo. - You're fast.
do you really think that Dylan Mccleen was a ranger? - Could be.
well, they did long-range recon in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.
hasn't every morsel been picked from that carcass?
Dan's onto something new. - Like what?
a lead. - Who he was, or is.
Really? - How much would you love that?
quite a bit.
course, you have a better chance of getting a Q&A with Jimmy Hoffa, but surprise me.
can I come back?
excuse me.
how the hell do you keep finding me?
who are you? - I'm nobody.
are you Green Beret? - No.
how did you know my landing zone? - I didn't. I was just there.
in the middle of the woods at night?
you're special ops. - No.
I saw what you did out there. No one disappears that fast but us.
Dylan... - that's not my name.
why are you following me? - I have no idea.
who's the guy in the picture? You looking for him?
what? You want money? - No. I want to help you.
Why?!
you follow me again...
just gonna watch me get stabbed?
what do you want me to do, hurl myself onto his knife?
it doesn't work like that. - Oh, really?
Where's dad?
he's working late, sweetie.
he said he was gonna help me with the sign.
I know he did, honey.
he will.
this new job of his, it's real tough on him.
on everybody.
who is it?!
SFPD.
sorry to disturb you, Mrs. Vasser. Wilson Hargraves, SFPD.
is everything okay?
we're investigating a robbery at a liquor store the night of your fund-raiser.
it's a place a couple of blocks away.
Hey, honey.
could you go upstairs and play for a few minutes?
okay. - Okay.
come on in. - Thank you.
Dylan Mccleen. You haven't heard of Dylan Mccleen?
he's the guy who...he hijacked a plane.
I told you I haven't. What's your problem?
sorry.
I've been on the road a lot. It 's taking its toll on the family.
tell me about it.
do you have a family?
no.
well, I do. I've got a son.
his name's Zack.
that's nice.
I'm doing a lousy job of raising him.
I keep get sucked out of his life at all the wrong times.
right now he thinks that I don't love him.
that's hard. I'm sorry.
two hot dogs, two sodas, please.
you worried that I won't be able to handle that you have a husband and family?
no, Dan.
I know you can handle that.
why are you still here? Why are you keeping an eye on me?
what are you doing here?
how are you gonna pay for lunch?
I thought so.
it's becoming a problem. - I told you to buy old currency.
it's expensive. Katie checked it out.
$2. 95. - $2. 95? It's a miracle.
sticker shock.
you were co-chair of the benefit at the museum? Is that right?
that's correct.
I'd love to see a guest list, if I could.
I'd rather not.
we promise discretion to our donors.
we promise to arrest people who commit armed robberies.
can I get that to you tomorrow?
you were at the event all night?
I was co-chair. Yes.
and your husband?
he attended.
you didn't see anyone there with a gun, did you?
no. I never saw a gun, no.
okay.
well, um...
listen, get me that list by tomorrow, if you can.
here's my card.
well, I...I really hope you get the guy.
Oh, we have a half dozen witnesses, a cabbie who gave him a ride.
a camera phone shot.
I think we'll find him. - Can I ask you a question?
and I-I don't mean to be flip. - Sure.
did the owner of the store say it was a man in a tuxedo who robbed him?
I mean, isn't that where you should start?
well, the owner of the store was pistol-whipped within an inch of his life.
he's in a coma, so we can't start there.
you have a good night, Mrs. Vasser. - Yeah.
look at me. Do you really think I'd rob a liquor store?
no, but I didn't think you'd come armed to a black-tie fundraiser either.
and people go to prison all the time for crimes they didn't commit.
it's gonna be okay.
how's Zack?
he's not great.
Jack says he'll take him to the game.
you have to tell him that you're not going, Dan.
I will. I'll do it tonight.
how was your day? - Fine.
I think I got a story on Dylan Mccleen.
the hijacker? - Yeah.
you met him back there. - Yeah.
can you imagine?
uncovering the identity of Dylan Mccleen.
it sounds like you're enjoying yourself.
it has its adrenaline moments, that's all.
and the Livia part? - No.
you're anadrenaline guy, Dan.
you liked the action when you were gambling.
maybe you want two women in different time zones. - Katie...
no, I mean, you know, technically, it wouldn't be cheating if it's in the past.
I was sleeping with Jack.
maybe you should sleep with Livia back there.
so if I'm with Livia back there, you can start sleeping with Jack, right?
what? Not funny?
honey, I'd trade adrenaline rush for marital bliss any day.
I know.
maybe if I just held onto you. - We could try it.
I'm gonna go see Zack. - Okay.
right away, sir. - Excuse me.
a man is looking for you; he's a soldier.
does anyone speak English here? - Yes, sir.
not you. Can I, can I borrow your pen? Hey, wait.
Thanks.
captain Rich?
you speak English? Is that his name?
where are you going? Where do you live?
new job in the valley. We must leave now.
wait.
I need to speak to you about Captain Rich.
he leave me. He said he'd help get my family here, but he did not.
I wait long time for Captain Rich; he no come.
captain Rich has been looking all over this city for you.
I moved to Oakland.
now I move to Sacramento. I follow work.
he has the money now to help your family.
please, please don't leave.
my name is Choung Seng.
do you know his first name?
captain Rich.
my children call him "Chaka Chacout."
it means "crazy dog."
he gave me this.
he helped me to escape, to come here.
what happened to him? - I do not know.
he was supposed to help get my family out of Cambodia.
I never would have left without them, but...
He...promised he could get them out and then he leave.
where is he now?
I don't know. - You do not know?
you said he was here. - Where do you live? How can I reach you?
do you, you have a job? - I quit Pacific Dragon today. I have no job.
go back to Pacific Dragon, get your job back, and give me that medal.
no. - Please, I...
please, I just...I need it to help you.
no.
I'm sorry.
Hey!
good morning.
I need to know all I can about an army ranger named Captain Rich...
southeast Asia, special ops.
do you thinkthis is Mccleen? - Maybe.
uh, first name? - Don't have it.
okay, that's going to make it hard. - Yeah, probably.
how's Dylan Mccleen coming? - I think I'm onto something, Hugh.
like his identity?
can you give me another day?
we've waited 32 years for this story.
we can wait a day.
are you serious about this, Dan?
I think I'm onto something, Hugh, and if it's not, I'll kill it.
can I help you?
you're Dan Vasser. - Yes.
I'm Elliot Langley from Lawrence Livermore.
I was speaking at USF.
I thought since I was in the neighborhood...
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, hmm?
Yeah, uh, let's go somewhere we can talk.
so...
how do you know my father?
I had just started at NASA.
your father was covering the shuttle prototype.
you had questions about tachyons?
you know, I'm pretty sure we spoke on the phone once about ten, maybe15 years ago.
Really? - Yeah.
maybe I was looking for your father.
maybe.
you have a very good memory, though.
I'm not doing a story on funding at Stanford. - Is that right?
it's not something I...
like people to know around here, but...
I'm working on a book.
it has a science fiction element.
time travel? - Yes.
the rules haven't changed much since Einstein.
ultimately, whether it's worm holes or warp drives, - time travel requires you to go186, 000 miles per second. - The speed of light.
that's the rub because so far nothing has demonstrate Dan ability to do that.
what about tachyons?
theoretical particles, never proven to exist.
so time travel is impossible?
no, just not proven.
500 years ago, we knew Pluto didn't exist.
five years ago, we knew it was a planet.
now we know it's not. Did Pluto change? No.
did our understanding of Pluto?
Yes.
you're an expert, Dr. Langley.
do you think time travel is possible?
until you prove to me you can or can't, I don't know.
how does your protagonist get around? I...
dabble in fiction myself.
he just does.
actually, he wants to find a way to control it.
stop it.
he claims to be falling through time randomly.
maybe a wormhole.
how terribly inconvenient.
Yeah.
any idea what might be doing that?
spontaneous symmetry breakage.
perturbation in the local dark energy density.
God.
are people taking advantage of him?
not yet.
they should; a person wielding that kind of power would be very valuable.
right?
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
I hope I've been some help.
you have. Yes.
I should go.
let me know if you want to talk more about this.
I will. Thank you.
do you validate?
sadly, no.
well, then...
you're good at this. You could do this for a living.
can you get us on the field after the game?
I don't know if I can do that, bud. - Why?
I'm not sure that I can go to the game. - What?
I got to work. But uncle Jack's gonna take you.
you promised.
I know, I know, Z.
I got this big new project. I'm sorry.
I'll be two seconds, okay? Hello?
not doing so well on Captain Rich.
wow, they said you were good.
okay, first of all, it's special ops, so it's not like there's a facebook.
and second, a first name would help.
I'll take anything, an address, medical record of any vet named Captain Rich living in Sanfrancisco in the '70s.
I don't care if he was a chaplain.
aye, aye.
Katie, I got to leave!
Hey.
Hey.
sorry.
that sucks.
this assignment's a bitch.
they're all a bitch. - I just need a name.
if I could only find Mccleen's real name, I could find him.
what do you know about him?
he was special ops in Cambodia during the Vietnam war.
I just need my laptop. - Wait, Dan, listen.
how did people survive back here?
Dan. - What?
I know someone here you can talk to.
a photo journalist covered the Vietnam war.
no. - Why not?
I thought I wasn't supposed to mess with things.
you're not. Just get what you need and get out of there.
he won't know you.
let's go visit your father.
vertigo?
that's what he said.
that's usually an inner ear problem. How's his hearing?
Dan's? - Yeah.
I think he hears fine. He just doesn't listen.
well, they seemed really nice.
Katie's beautiful. - Oh, yeah, Katie's great.
so, uh, how many dates are required for a full disclosure?
normally, I'd say 20, but since you just brought it up...
I'm gonna go with five. - No, we'll go with 20.
no, buddy, you don't get to do that, open that door and then walk away.
you were a woman.
I'm hurt that you could even consider that a possibility.
I'm a doctor. I know what's possible.
and you have delicate hands.
