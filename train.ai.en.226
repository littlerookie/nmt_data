exxonmobil got a boost from rising oil prices during the quarter.

exxonmobil, bp, chevron, and france-based total are also working to form shale gas partnerships with chinese oil and gas companies, according to an august national geographic report.
exxonmobil, the world's biggest listed integrated energy group, yesterday blamed the government of kazakhstan for delaying the development of the world's biggest new oilfield, significantly raising the level of acrimony surrounding the troubled project.
