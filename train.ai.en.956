Taxi! Can you see him?
look, he's getting into the mechanical wagon.
Oh, no. Clearly that distance is too great...
off you go! No! Gutsy!
come on, Smurfs! Smurfabunga!
goodbye, blue world.
use your hat, you ninny!
couldn't we just have taken the stairs?
there we go. Not funny, Gutsy.
it was a little funny. Smurfs.
we're stopping. Hold on tight.
not to me, Grouchy.
Oh, did I do that? Sorry.
keep the change. Thanks, man.
master Winslow, we really need your help.
Hey. Right here.
what are you doing here?
what part of "we need a Stargazer" don't you understand?
you can't be out in public. Who are you talking to?
if we could just have a quick look around in your predicting parlor...
we really wanna go home. Come on, man, I gotta go.
fine. Just come here, come here. Please, please.
all of you. Trust me.
careful. Hey, watch the smurf berries.
I'm not going... Hey!
be quiet. It's dark in here.
all right, who smurfed?
Hey! Get your hand out of my kilt.
that's not my hand. Hey, ticklish.
morning. Morning. Good morning, Mr. Winslow.
congratulations on your promotion. Thank you.
I hope you guys like desk drawers, because that's where...
you're late. Odile!
you were in my office.
it's my building, and we have much work to do.
the launch for Jouvenel is tomorrow night. Is your concept ready?
close. I had a crazy morning.
what are you doing?
nothing. I'm excited. I'm excited about all the concept ideas.
and hungry. Sorry. Hungry for its success.
nervous energy.
nervous energy's what's going on up in here.
I like it. Yep.
the fear of failure is a fabulous motivator. True that.
Hey! Stop it.
Henri. Make it work.
you have no idea.
what is this? Why did I get the armpit?
stop pushing me. Go easy on the cologne tomorrow.
are you crazy?
you're gonna get me fired. My hair!
I couldn't even breathe in there. It smelled like the business end of a sheep.
I don't see a Stargazer. How you doing?
I'm sorry, Master Winslow, but we badly need to borrow your Stargazer.
I don't have a Stargazer, okay?
it's not something people of this century just have, especially here.
not happy. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to work.
well, perhaps we could sing to help things along.
and then we'll get the stargazer. Come along, Smurfs.
la la la la la la Sing a happy song
la la la la la la Smurf the whole day long
stop.
la la la la la la
stop!
sing a happy song
come on. None of you find that song just the tiniest bit annoying?
I find it annoying.
well, what do you sing at work?
I don't sing at work. What?
and you have to wear a leash. Harsh.
I know. How about if we hum?
huh huh huh huh huh Please stop humming.
I need to hone my message here.
I've got a message.
always chew with your mouth closed." Papa taught us that.
that's good. You should use that.
Or,Dance, and be happy.
how about, "Grab life by the grapes"?
turn that frown upside down." "Always bet on blue.
have a smurfy day." "I kissed a Smurf and I liked it"?
it's an embarrassment of riches.
they're giving you gold here.
thank you. Master Winslow, you'll know it's the right message if it comes from the heart.
right, Smurfs? Yeah.
you said it. Absolutely.
of course. Welcome to my world.
I love emerging dramatically through the smoke.
it makes... It makes me feel so deliciously mysterious.
also, it gives the skin a wonderful glow.
what?
where? Where?
what?
curses! So close.
what?
theirs is upside-down.
idiots. They painted it wrong. Come, Azrael.
Hi. Hello.
what are you doing?
just greening things up a bit.
that's so sweet. but, you know, I'm not so sure this stuffs gonna grow out here.
we'll see. Smurfs have a very blue thumb.
so where is everybody else?
they went to get a Stargazer so Papa can smurf a blue moon to get us home.
and they went without you?
Yeah. I mean, who knows why?
Hey! Sorry!
why don't we come inside?
Smurfs, where are you? Make sure to demonstrate that this new anti-aging cream can make any woman look beautiful, young, vibrant. It's almost magical.
astonishing, really.
I see no transformation.
your potion has no power. Excuse me?
well, she's still an eye-offending dogfish, if you ask me.
sir! This is my mother who you're speaking of.
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize.
how sad for you in 30 years.
Henri, escort this lunatic out.
lunatic? Security!
I am the great and powerful Gargamel!
could a lunatic do this?
Alakazootiful!
lit you, mama.
how did you do that?
Yes, and seriously, me next.
so sorry, but lunatics and great wizards never reveal their secrets.
come, Azrael! Now, where are my Smurfs?
no, no, no, no, no. Don't go.
I need to know what you just did. Not telling.
please, sir? or, Can you do that again?
you may attempt to persuade me.
what is it that you desire?
riches?
fame?
fortune?
with my help, the whole world will know the name that is Garbagesmell.
Gargamel.
Yes. With my help, the whole world will know the genius that is Gargamel.
I'm...
I'm sorry. Did you just say "genius"?
so, even though I'm what you might call accident-prone, on the bright side, I did land us all here in your little mushroom, and we got to meet you and Patrick.
you're so sweet. And I know how you feel. I'm so clumsy, too.
well, I used to be.
Really? Yeah.
so how long did it take you to...
gosh.
Un-fumble your feet?
well, about as long as it takes to realize that nobody's just one thing.
you can be anything you wanna be.
hero Smurf." Yeah.
probably not.
Hey, Brainy, help me figure this out. Let me show you.
first, you put your...
works every time.
la la la la la la Sing a happy song
this is a fascinating wind machine you have here.
Hi, Patrick. Grace, help. Help!
they are everywhere and they won't stop singing.
I cannot get a thing done. Please come and get these guys.
Gargamel, I'll be frank.
clinique, Lancome? MAC. They will kill to get what you have in that ring.
not if we Kill them first.
let's see, we're going to need some knights, preferably in shining armor, some bowmen, poison arrows.
I like the way you think.
and some spikes to mount their heads on.
well, it is all about the presentation.
and, of course, all of our testing would be animal cruelty-free?
what, they pay extra for the animal cruelty? Is that it?
get out of here.
you have a wicked sense of humor.
we like that, don't we? Hey, out of here!
Henri?
I said, get out of here.
se? or Gargamel, now you must assure me, darling, that you can recreate whatever it was that you did to my mother, but on a massive scale.
do that, and the world will worship you.
did you hear that, Azrael? Yeah.
worship." Oh, it rolls off the tongue like flesh from a... Not pilgrim...
oh,Heretic. Yes, thank you.
thank the gods, a chamber pot.
this swill that you call Dom PÃ©rignon has gone straight to my nether regions.
here, toss this out the window, quick, please.
now, to the matter at hand.
so do we have a deal?
not quite, my sweet maiden.
you see, first I must have my Smurfs.
you guys just have to understand that Patrick's under a lot of pressure right now.
so if you could just lay low for a little bit...
you have my word of honor, Miss Grace. My Smurfs will not move from this bag.
okay, good. Stargazer!
what? Stargazer! Let's go!
everybody out! Come on! No, no, no!
guys, let's go! No, no, no, no, no!
full Smurf ahead. No, wait, wait!
hit the deck!
Hey, I'm walking here! I'm walking!
save me! Hey, look out, Brainy.
can't everyone just slow down and enjoy life? Get off me. Get off!
wait for it.
I gotta get me one of those.
Oh, my gosh!
Hey, lady! Hey! Wait, wait. Hold on!
when we get inside, spread out and find that Stargazer.
come on, Smurfs!
Hey. Patrick, the Smurfs have gone awol.
grace, are you running?
no, no, I'm totally fine, but they need your help!
Patrick, I'm afraid they're gonna get themselves killed!
sweetie, they're fine. They can send us a tiny thank-you note when they get back to shroom town. Right after they invent paper.
Patrick, they need you.
honey... Patrick, I need you.
Oh, my gosh, please hurry!
all right. Where are you?
the man is a lunatic. It's not going to work. I don't know, he needs Smoops.
Smurfs." Smarps.
no, no, "Smurfs." "Smurfs" with an...
sorry. I'm so sorry.
you call that groveling, you fool?
every village has an idiot. What?
you're right. That's him! Stop! Stop! Smurf thief!
Smurf thief!
come on, guys, the dolls are here!
Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer. Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer...
so that's where all the unicorns went.
I'm not afraid to go off on my own, I thought you might like the company.
fine. Then hang on.
a Smurf cannon! The only way to fly.
perfect.
time to catch some air! Smurfabunga!
that'll put some air up your skirt!
gotta be a Stargazer up here somewhere.
predator!
Smurf droppings.
these are disgustingly tasty.
hello.
Oh, creepy.
I hope they weren't looking for a stargazer, too.
stargazers, stargazers...
dresses!
you mean I can have more than one kind of dress,oh my god?
what?
Papa, I'm telling you, we're never gonna find those...
stargazers. They're dangerously high.
you're right. We're gonna need something tall.
don't you think someone will notice us? Just act natural.
I'm a bear. Brainy!
I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming, guys.
hold still, stairs!
look at the stair-climbing toy!
Hey. What is that?
let me see it. Careful.
I want one, too, Mommy! Let me see.
I'm just tired of the whole dating game.
just say who you are and be who you say, right?
I can't seem to get it to scan.
my son wants one of those blue animatronic things.
can you help me out here? Do they come in pink?
my daughter wants pink. I'm sorry.
what aisle did you find this on?
I'll take the floor model. I was here first.
there's a line. Can I interest you in a Coldy Holdy Ice Bat?
what? Ice Bat?
it comes in pink.
Smurf thief ! stop!
do I use my grouchiness as a wall because I'm afraid to be vulnerable?
you bet.
Smurf!
but I've got feelings.
no. No, I can't be out already! What was I thinking?
wasting my only drop of Smurf essence on that old hag?
it's a big problem, sir. We don't seem to have it in stock.
Hey! Keep your smurfs to yourselves!
don't you people have any boundaries? Grab it!
I'm not a toy!
where is she? Where'd she go?
there she is! There she is!
Hey, this dress is mine!
Smurfette! Wait, I'm shopping.
let's shop later. Go! Come on!
Patrick! Patrick, help! Clumsy, come here!
a giant's after me! She's huge!
Hey, that's mine!
sorry, little girl, this one's not for...
mommy! Really?
don't ever forget that one magical moment our two worlds met.
and I wasn't grouchy, I wasn't.
can you just say one thing, please? I'm dying here.
Hey!
that's one!
technically, when loading cargo onto the head of a bear, one should distribute the weight... Brainy, just pull.
hurry up, What are ya waiting for? We're drawing a crowd.
show-off. Oh, dear. They think we're toys.
hold onto your knickers, boys, it's about to get grisly.
don't let me fall! Just hang onto that stargazer, you two!
Hey! Come on, Smurfs! They're getting away!
let's go, go, go!
I'll have you at ramming speed in no time.
hold on! I think we lost them.
again with the head. Oh, dear.
out of the way or I'll caber toss ya! Where did you learn how to drive?
you think you can do better? Yes, I do believe I can do better.
two more!
Brainy! Gutsy! Papa!
grace, that's Gargamel!
Oh, you again! Get your paws off me! No, no, no, no.
bad kitty!
Oh, I hate that Cat!
Gargamel.
Smurfette.
more lovely than ever.
Oh, Gargamel, I guess you've outsmarted us again.
or not!
Azrael. Azrael, what are you doing? Get out of my suckamajig!
get out! Let me help you with that.
Oh, thank you, kind... You! You...
yahoo!
Patrick. Hey.
impressive. Thanks.
I'll get the Stargazer. I'll get the Smurfs.
that's him! He took it right off my back! Leaf-blower thief!
please stand up, sir. You're going downtown.
do not resist. Do not resist! Unhand me. Unhand me, you heathens!
or suffer the wrath of the great and powerful...
let me... Let me see here...
how can you be the only girl in the village?
well, see, I wasn't brought by a stork like the others.
I was created by Gargamel to trap the other Smurfs.
Wow. And then what happened?
Papa saved me.
he cast a special spell and then helped me become the Smurf I was meant to be.
play it safe.
Odile, pending your approval, it's ready to go to the billboard agency.
well, here goes nothing.
Papa should be done by now. Yeah. Enough with the suspense.
I wanna go home. Me, too.
now that that wily wizard's got our scent, it's a whole new wager.
without that blue moon, we can't open the entry, all is gone.
well, it's off.
time to either celebrate or file for unemployment.
Hey, what's wrong?
I'm sure we'll be fine. Oh. It's okay.
that one's hypersmurfilating. Yeah, tell me about it.
it's all this waiting that's killing us. Yeah.
I know the feeling.
better yet...
I know the cure.
you just match the colors with the buttons.
you try.
Hey! Go, Grouchy!
you're good! Nice one!
Hey, look at me, guys! I'm shredding!
walk this way...
you sing.
talk this way Just give me a kiss
it's a rock face.
it's Gene Simmons. He's a... Huh?
never mind.
like this Like this
Smurfette sweetie is a classy kind of sassy
little skirts climbing way up her knee
not another single girl in the whole smurf in' world
and I can't believe she's lookin' at me it's a complete Surrender
to the power of her Gender
so I close my eyes and make a wish
I just want to Savor
all her smurf berry Flavor
so I smurfed her just a little kiss Like this
check out Clumsy. Whoa, Clumsy.
you found your niche. Yeah!
clumsy, holdin' it down. Look at him go!
come on, Gutsy! Here we go!
yay, Gutsy! Get down with your bad smurf!
go, Gutsy! That's right.
careful. Get your smurf on!
Gutsy! Nice!
Yeah! Thank you.
that was rare.
Hey, guys. How do you like my new dress?
Whoa! Is there a draught in here?
Oh, okay, that's not what I had in mind.
are you thinkin' what I'm thinking?
sorry, boys.
Yeah, that cools the giblets.
nothin' like a cool breeze through my Enchanted Forest.
it's approved. What?
she approved it. She approved the ad! She loved it?
well, she said "approved," so coming from her, that's love.
Oh, my goodness!
Patrick, yeah! You owned it!
Oh, my goodness! Yay, Patrick!
Yeah.
no jumping, no jumping, no jumping. No jumping, no jumping. Okay.
should I send it? I'm not going to. Yes! Do it!
do it this minute. I will do it. All right.
do it, do it.
go, go, go!
tomorrow this'll be on every billboard in New York City.
it's a go, laddie boy!
well done, Master Winslow. Oh! Hey, guys, Papa's back.
Papa, are your calculations done? Yeah!
I'm nearly out of smurf berries.
it's proving more difficult than I'd hoped.
but we are going home, right?
of course. Just not tonight.
now, off to bed.
I was hoping I'd be sleeping in my mushroom tonight.
I miss the other Smurfs.
me, too.
I've never spent the night away from home before.
well, there was last night. But who could sleep?
hush. Hush now, Smurfs.
everything's going to be just fine.
Papa?
do you really believe we're ever gonna get home to the other Smurfs?
don't worry.
we'll be reunited with the others soon enough.
if only the stars would align.
you know who I miss? Chef Smurf. Hefty Smurf.
Hey, Jokey Smurf. Greedy. Narrator.
painter. Baker. Harmony.
Oh, I miss Complimentary Smurf. He always has such nice things to say.
I'll tell you who I don't miss, Passive-Aggressive Smurf.
Aye. Yeah.
he's always so nice, but when he leaves you feel bad.
Ah, another wretched Smurf less night.
Oh, hello, little moth.
perhaps with your help I'll find a way to get them back.
Oh, you and I are kindred spirits, little one.
both of us meant to soar.
go now, and bring back an army of mighty eagles to free me.
fly, tiny eagle. Fly and bring back your brethren.
fly! Fly!
fly!
okay. Let's see here.
Hey.
I'm guessing you have a long night ahead of you.
you guys drink coffee? Is a Smurf's butt blue?
so tell me, that weird guy in the ratty bathrobe at the toy store?
Gargamel? He's not really a wizard, is he?
not the smartest of sorcerers, but dangerous just the same.
thank you.
back home, I could hold him at bay with a spell or two.
but here, without my books and potions...
well, today we got lucky. But next time, who knows?
well, what are you gonna do?
I'll do anything and everything I can do to get my Smurfs home.
I won't ever give up. They're my family.
and you never give up on family.
doesn't it freak you out sometimes having all those little guys depending on you?
I mean, what if you screw up?
how'd you know when you were ready?
here. Come sit on Papa's lap.
Yeah, right. Scratch that.
probably not the best idea. Yeah, yeah.
let me ask you something.
why did you come for us today when your Grace called?
she needed me. I could hear it in her voice.
that's what being a papa is.
when it comes time, you just do.
and knowing what to do doesn't come from up here.
it comes from here, where it matters most.
my spleen?
no, your heart.
I'm trying to have a moment here, you whippersnapper.
you're a good papa, Papa. And you'll be a good one, too.
come on, what you doing, man? Get that weight off there.
come on, baby, stop playing.
come on, you silly moth. Where are my eagles?
you know what happens to people who sit on my bench?
be gone with you, behemoth, for I have instructed a moth to summon forth a gaggle of noble eagles to free me from this confine.
get up, Grandpa! Hey.
you see? You see?
the dungeon isn't built that can hold the likes of Gargamel.
behold my glorious army of... Flies?
flies? I Said "to fly." "Fly." What is this?
not "flies," you light-loving moron.
all right, up, up, up, bother it all.
up! Up, you inglorious devils!
so long, scallywags!
well, don't do it again. Go around it, go around!
Oh, that's nasty. Go around it. Stupid flies.
wait, take me with you!
wait! Wait!
to my castle for more essence!
here they come, here they come.
pretty smurfy, if I do say so myself. Yeah.
come on, Elway, right over here. Good boy. Thank you very much.
Oh, my goodness. Here we go.
there we are. Clumsy.
blue thumbs. This is unbelievable.
I think there's too much pink.
just because your name is Grouchy doesn't mean you always have to be grouchy.
Yeah, it does.
Smurfette. Hi.
high five. High four. High four.
great news! The stars have revealed a perfect time to smurf the blue moon.
we're going home! Yay! I knew you'd do it, Papa!
all right! Smurftastic!
I never doubted it for a second.
it has to be done tonight, between first star and high moon.
that's our only chance.
but we'll need a magic spell that works in this realm to open the portal home.
master Winslow, a question, please. Yeah, shoot.
is there a place that sells spells?
no.
is there a place that proffers potions? no.
how about old books?
wait, there's an antique book shop right near where I work.
Yes. Dr. Wong's. Yeah. Dr. Wong's something.
perfect. That'll do. Oh, hear that, boys? We're almost home.
Yeah! I love being almost home.
Hey! Smurf hug!
Oh, I love you guys!
bring it in, big fella.
I wouldn't... Come on, we know you want to.
Yes. Yeah, come on, Patrick.
if I can do it, you can do it. Go on, big fella.
here he comes! Smurf hug!
we're going home! Hey there.
Hey, get up here.
that's it, laddie. Nice one. What's that?
Yeah. All of ya. All of ya!
Oh, look! We don't have to make a blue moon.
we've already got one.
Really? What?
look, guys, right over there. No, it isn't.
it is. Smurfette's right. Look at the blue moon.
that's the wrong ad.
what happened to my office?
we fixed it for the baby. Another smurf hug!
no. No, no, no. This isn't happening. This isn't happening.
someone sent this to the ad agency last night.
who messed with my computer? I dunno.
none of my Smurfs would... Wasn't me.
I might sort of, tripped.
Yeah, well, you Gargamel! sorta, just got me fired.
you sent the wrong file.
Patrick, it was just an accident. What am I supposed to do, Grace?
you said that they would bring good luck. This is anything but good.
I never should've let this happen. I should've said no.
I never wanted a house full of little people running around!
blue. Little blue...
okay...
Patrick.
what are you doing?
going to try to save my job.
we never intended to be a burden, Master Winslow.
I'm smurfilly sorry about what I...
stop saying "smurf" for everything. What does that even mean? Smurf!
Smurfitty-smurf-smurf-smurf!
there's no call for that kind of language, laddie.
see?
okay, Patrick, wait.
Hey, hey! Will you...
wait, Patrick. Maybe I can try to fix it.
just stop and listen to me for a second, please.
what? Look, I'm really sorry about your job, okay?
and I hope that you can straighten that out.
but you are so not seeing the big picture here.
I mean, look around. Look what's happening right now.
of all the people on the planet, those magical little creatures came to us.
they chose us.
don't you see how absolutely amazing that is?
this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, Patrick.
this is our blue moon.
and if you don't stop for just a second to see that, you're gonna miss it.
Hey, hey. Taxi!
come on! Come on! Blast. Blast you!
there's got to be some essence in here somewhere!
not now.
what?
very, very well done, my little friend.
and to think, I almost ate you that time.
come, Azrael. We must find this Patrick, the rouge merchant.
he will lead us to our elusive little blue quarry.
don't you just have a switch or something to shut them off?
tomorrow? Are you kidding me?
Ron, If I don't get those ads down now, I don't have a job tomorrow.
Odile
fix this, Or you're FIRED!
Smurf me.
baby's First Picture
which way to the bookstore, Brainy?
according to the searching device, we take the F machine two dots past the red circle to Chinaland.
look out, Brainy. "Chinatown," birdbrain.
Smurftito, smurftato. Here it is.
come on, everybody. Let's go, let's go.
mind the gap. Wait? Are we sure about this?
what? Jump!
Oh, my. Not happy.
come on, guys, Let's poke around this great steel carriage.
is it safe? Of course it is.
that was great.
I hope we find this place soon. I can't see out of this...
for smurf's sake.
I thought that's why we left Clumsy behind.
Oh, it smells like butter in here.
where do you suppose this magic bookstore could be?
wait a minute. There it is.
it's closed. Figures.
we have to find a way in. Come on.
I'm getting too old for this.
brainy. Gutsy.
everybody gets in.
Hey. Wow.
this place looks creepy to me.
it's not creepy, it's different. And I like it.
let's just get the book and get out here.
you're right. This book of spells is our ticket home.
I am but a simple wizard with a simple desire, limitless power and world adulation.
now why does it have to be so hard?
pardon me. Please, wise sir. Wise sir. Please, please.
wherever did you hear that ear-damning squall?
it's your little blue men.
I saw them going into the bookstore around the corner.
you know, that song is really annoying.
cautiously excited.
that's not it. That's not it. Hey! Oh, no, that's not it.
look at all these amazing books. It's gotta be in here somewhere.
no, this isn't it. You see anything, Smurfette?
nothing up here, guys. Look out below!
I've got somethin', lads. Great job, Gutsy.
Oh. Nearly there.
well done. Just a minute. That's it. There we go.
Ah, yes.
L'Histoire des Schtroumpfs.
Peyo.
that's us. Yes, this is the one.
look at that. Wow.
I'll be smurfed.
the secret runes are hidden in the drawing.
you see all that in there?
look here, at the patterns on this page.
Openous-lockicuss.
what?
you're right, Azrael. This does have "me" written all over it.
Oh, that's just plain naughty.
all that remains now is to return to the waterfall and invoke this spell, tonight.
and we can go home? And we can go home.
Oh, you're going home, all right. No.
to a little place I like to call BellVeedaRay Castle, where your essence shall finally be mine.
the dragon wand. No!
it's...
Oh, please, please, allow me.
it's Gargamel! Run, Smurfs!
come on, Smurfs! Go, go, go!
wait for me!
to the door! Smurfentine! Smurfentine!
Hurry! Yes, yes, do resist, little Smurfs.
after all, what is the hunt without the thrill!
No!
we gotta go! Move! Run!
get going , Smurfs! Faster, faster.
let's get outta here.
brainy, take the spell, brew the potion and smurf the moon tonight.
it has to be tonight.
me? Smurf the moon?
no, no, I'm not ready. You have to be.
go. And no matter what happens... Papa?
...do not come back for me. What?
Papa, no! No!
Papa! What are you waiting for, Gargamel?
come to papa, Papa!
just go! Papa!
Papa! No!
keep moving , lass.
do as Papa said. Papa!
is that all that you've got, Gargamel?
what's gonna happen to Papa?
Papa told us to smurf the moon, and that's exactly what we're gonna do.
come on. We don't have much time.
come on? where?
how are we gonna get back to Clumsy?
we ride. Come on!
be still, bird. I don't think they're friendly.
well, neither am I. But they carry disease.
and Smurfs. Let's ride.
whoa, bird, whoa! Come on!
but I'm not sure I can do this.
you can do it, Brainy. Hold on!
according to my calculations, this is dangerous!
it's getting dark.
Yeah. Yeah, I think we'd better go look for them.
Yeah.
Hi.
where are the others? We think they're still at the bookstore.
listen, Grace, I'm...
Hey, Odile.
Patrick...
listen, listen. Before you fire me,
I know that the ads that ran weren't the ads I sent.
but they're the ads I should have sent.
the ads I almost did send.
but I didn't 'cause...
I second-guessed myself.
I gave you what I thought you wanted, instead of what I thought was right.
but this is right.
it means something to me and... I don't know,
I think it's gonna mean something to others, too.
it's not just a moon, Odile, it's a blue moon.
once in a blue moon.
that means that there are only a few moments in your life when something truly memorable, truly magical, happens to you.
and, if you hesitate, if you're afraid, you might just miss it.
that's what that image means.
don't let those blue moon moments pass you by.
I will call you back to tell you if you're fired.
I so smurf in' love you.
Left-left, right! Right-right, bird!
brace for impact! The window's open, ya ninny.
we're outta control!
whoa, bird! Watch out for the...
that'll do, pigeon. Thank you, bird.
look! We got the incantation.
Where's Papa? Gargamel's got him.
what? Oh, no.
he took him to some place called BellVeedaRay Castle.
he's gonna... Don't say it.
BellVeedaRay. What is BellVeedaRay?
Belve... He's taken him to Belvedere Castle in Central Park.
to extract his essence.
what? we have to go get him.
No! Gargamel's more powerful than ever.
Papa said no matter what happens we're not to go back for him.
he's trying to protect us.
No! We can't leave Papa behind. It was a Smurf promise.
no, no, no. We can't.
we promised Papa we'd do exactly what he said.
that's right. I didn't.
I never promised him anything.
neither did I. And there is no way I'm leaving here without Papa.
Patrick, wait. I'm coming with you.
I'm in.
Aye. Me, too.
no Smurf left behind! Not Papa, and not you.
all for one and one for Smurf !
I 'll squeeze a few And tweeze a few
and steal their essence blue
very impressive, my dear, sweet little Papa!
Oh, look at this.
just a tiny little bit of your little tiny beard yields me all of this essence.
just imagine what I'll be able to harvest from your entire family of Smurfs.
Alakazookas!
behold my glorious Smurf magic machine!
no. No! The cages! No! No!
I'll steam the essence from their sweat. I'll tug it from their tears!
I'll snip it from their hair.
you're a fool, Gargamel.
my Smurfs are well on their way home by now.
Oh, yeah. Let's light this candle.
good luck, Gutsy!
into the breach! I'll see you there!
we all remember the plan, right? Let's get our smurf on.
brainy, what's happening?
I've added the ingredients. It's more powerful than anticipated.
I don't think I can do it.
okay, Brainy, you can do this. Just say the incantation.
I'll be smurfed!
I did it. I did it, Papa! I did it!
I don't believe it! Wow.
it's the Anjelou moon. How did she do that?
it's beautiful. Oh, Odile.
Oh, wow. That's wonderful.
now, I don't want you to worry, Papa.
that which doesn't kill you only makes me stronger.
yo! Huh?
Gargamel! Come out and play!
Oh, I think our tiny little guests have finally arrived.
No! Ah, well.
enjoy the ride, Papa!
and remember, keep your hands and feet inside the cart at all times. No. No! No!
Smurfs, run!
Smurfs.
you have our Papa. Prepare to get smurfed!
Yeah, what he said.
adorable.
two little smurfs come to save their beloved Papa.
Hey, Gargamel.
make that three little smurfs.
and I went home and got a few friends.
my, my, my god !
I think the whole village must be here.
whatever will I do with all this essence?
on me, boys.
fire!
let's get this hoedown started!
there comes a time when every Smurf must stand up...
watch it, you little hoodlums!
for what is good and cute and blue in the world.
and on this brisk New York night, that time is now.
Hey! Seriously?
sorry, it's kind of what I do.
eat yolk, Gargamel!
Patrick, can you do it?
go, go, go!
hurry, they can't hold out for long.
Smurfs!
you know, one bad apple can ruin your whole day.
full smurf ahead!
come on!
Hey, Gargamel, here's a little souvenir from the Big Apple.
out of the frying pan... And into the...
fire. Fire.
I'm too beautiful to die!
Oh, Papa.
no. No, Smurfette.
what did he do to you?
you shouldn't have come back for me.
Papa, I'm getting you out of here right now.
Smurfette!
hang on, Papa, I'll be back.
charge!
get him!
grab the wand!
going in! Go!
bombs away!
I'm going for a strike! Alakazam!
crikey. Look out, Gutsy!
Oh, ya blinking flip!
hang on, Papa.
Oh, onions!
get back, cat.
here, kitty, kitty...
Smurfette!
looking for me?
play time is over!
behold the awesome power of me!
Smurfette?
had enough, huh?
you're mine, kitty.
I'm done smurfing around.
you smurfed with the wrong girl.
I got you, Greedy. Oh, my cupcake!
what's happening, Papa?
No!
Gargamel!
not so fast, goody blue-shoes.
Oh, Papa!
now, it's time to break their little blue wills.
no. Are you watching closely, Smurfs?
Papa! Your beloved little Papa is about to meet his little blue end.
No!
Upsy-daisy!
Oh, no. Papa!
Papa!
No! No!
you again!
goodbye!
I'm really...
this ends here, this ends now!
really going to enjoy this.
gotcha!
freedom!
upstairs ,son of a smurf!
come back here!
go, Gutsy!
come back here right now with my wand!
Oh, no. Crikey.
I... I got it.
Oh, dear. Clumsy.
so this is how it ends. Our goose is cooked.
this is not gonna be good. We're doomed.
I got it! I got it!
the vision's never been wrong.
I got it!
my wand! Give me back my wand!
how dare you!
how dare you defy the great and powerful...
Oh, my God.
Smurfs!
are you dead?
nice one, Clumsy! Are you kidding me?
get up here, you! Yeah!
Bravo! thanks so much, Clumsy!
Patrick. Hey.
Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy!
clumsy, you're a hero.
I'm a hero?
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm a hero! I'm so sorry, guys. Definitely killed the moment.
clumsy, you little mook, you. It's Papa.
I owe you an apology, Clumsy.
I believed more in a vision than I did in you.
I'm so proud of you, Clumsy.
Thanks, Papa.
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
and now to get rid of this!
to the portal, everyone! There's no time to spare.
Smurfy'all later! Bye.
I'm not one for long goodbyes, but I did smurf together a few words I'd like to say.
Bye. Take care.
I hated this. So much less than I expected.
Bye, Grouchy. Don't get me wrong, I still hated it. Just less.
I'll not soon forget this place. Especially not with these!
I shall be back, Broadway. Tootles!
Hey, girlfriend. Wow.
I've never had a girlfriend before.
I'll never forget you. Smurfette.
high four.
high four, Grace.
Hey, Smurfette. And you.
Hi. You, the little hero, come here.
hero? Stop.
actually, you mind saying it one more time?
it's kinda got a nice ring to it.
Bye, Grace. Well, Master Winslow, thank you.
you saved me. So long!
you saved my whole family.
actually I think it was the other way around.
well, I should get going. I've got a Smurf village to rebuild.
your village has given me some ideas.
come here.
goodbye, Papa.
goodbye, Papa.
let's go home.
and so, the Smurfs left the strange city of New York, and I think they left it a little sweeter, a little wiser, a little smurfier.
and as that portal began to close for the last time...
Hey! Seriously, stop!
Bye, New York!
it's Odile. Hey, Odile.
Patrick, I just called to say thank you.
finally someone has given me what I want.
I think I'm not fired.
Wow!
Wow. So that's a new job, new baby, some unique new friends...
you know if you really want a bigger place. Bigger?
are you crazy? Then we'll be further apart.
Oh, Grace...
I smurf you.
Smurfs. Smurfs!
I wish I could quit you. Get out of here.
what are you looking at?
did you know there are more people with genius IQs living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States?
that can't possibly be true. It is.
what would account for that?
well, first, an awful lot of people live in China, but here's my question.
how do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SATS?
I didn't know they take SATs in China. They don't.
I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about me.
you got a 1600?
Yes. I could sing in an a cappella group, but I can't sing.
does that mean you actually got nothing wrong?
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.
or you could get into a final club.
or I get into a final club.
you know, from a woman's perspective, sometimes not singing in an a cappella group is a good thing.
this is serious.
on the other hand, I do like guys who row crew.
well, I can't do that.
I was kidding.
and, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.
have you ever tried? I'm trying right now.
to row crew? To get into a final club.
to row crew? No. Are you, like, whatever, delusional?
maybe it's just sometimes you say two things at once.
I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to be aiming at.
but you've seen guys who row crew, right?
no.
okay, well, they're bigger than me. They're worldclass athletes.
and a second ago, you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you had met one.
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it. You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.
okay.
should we get something to eat?
would you like to talk about something else?
no. It's just since the beginning of the conversation about finals club,
I think I may have missed a birthday.
there are really more people in China with genius IQs than the entire population...
the Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc.
which one?
the Porcellian, the Porc. It's the best of the best.
which Roosevelt? Theodore.
is it true that they send a bus around to pick up girls who want to party with the next Fed chairman?
so you can see why it's so important to get in.
okay, well, which is the easiest to get into?
why would you ask me that? I was just asking.
none of them. That's the point.
my friend Eduardo made $300, 000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won't come close to getting in.
the ability to make money doesn't impress anybody around here.
must be nice. He made $300, 000 in a summer?
he likes meteorology. You said it was oil futures.
you can read the weather, you can predict the price of heating oil.
I think you asked me that because you think the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance.
I... What?
you asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that that's the one where I'll have the best chance.
the one that's the easiest to get into would be the one where anybody has the best chance.
you didn't ask me which one was the best one, you asked me which one was the easiest one.
I was honestly just asking, okay? I was just asking to ask.
mark, I'm not speaking in code. Erica.
you're obsessed with finals clubs.
you have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about it who will prescribe you some sort of medication.
you don't care if the side effects may include blindness.
final clubs. Not "finals clubs.
and there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated.
Yes. There is.
well, you do. That was cryptic, so you do speak in code.
I didn't mean to be cryptic.
I'm just saying I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs.
Why? Because they're exclusive.
and fun, and they lead to a better life.
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president because he was a member of the Phoenix Club.
he was a member of the Porcellian, and yes, he did.
well, why don't you just concentrate on being the best you you can be?
did you really just say that?
I was kidding.
just because something's trite doesn't make it less true.
I wanna try to be straightforward with you and tell you I think you might want to be a little more supportive.
if I get in, I will be taking you to the events and the gatherings, and you'll be meeting a lot of people you wouldn't normally get to meet.
you would do that for me?
we're dating.
well, I wanna try and be straightforward with you and let you know that we're not anymore.
what do you mean? We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry.
is this a joke? No, it's not.
you're breaking up with me?
you're gonna introduce me to people
I wouldn't normally have the chance to meet?
what the... What is that supposed to mean?
wait, settle down. What is it supposed to mean?
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink right now is 'cause you used to sleep with the door guy.
the door guy"? His name is Bobby. I have not slept with the door guy.
the door guy is a friend of mine, and he's a perfectly good class of people.
and what part of Long Island are you from, Wimbledon?
wait. Wait, wait. I'm going back to my dorm.
is this real? Yes.
then wait, I apologize, okay? I have to go study.
Erica? Yes?
I'm sorry, I mean it. I appreciate that, but I have to go study.
come on, you don't have to study. Let's just talk.
I can't. Why?
because it is exhausting. Dating you is like dating a StairMaster.
all I meant is that you're not likely to... Currently...
I wasn't making a comment on your appearance.
I was saying that you go to BU. I was stating a fact, that's all, and if it seemed rude, then I apologize.
I have to go study. You don't have to study.
why do you keep saying I don't have to study?
cause you go to BU.
do you want to get some food?
I am sorry you are not sufficiently impressed with my education.
and I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat, so we're even.
I think we should just be friends. I don't want friends.
I was just being polite.
I have no intention of being friends with you.
I'm under some pressure right now from my OS class and if we could just order some food, I think we should...
okay, you are probably going to be a very successful computer person.
but you're gonna go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd.
and I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that that won't be true.
it'll be because you're an asshole.
Erica Albright's a bitch.
do you think that's because her family changed their name from Albrecht, or do you think it's because all BU girls are bitches?
for the record, she may look like a 34C, but she's getting all kinds of help from our friends at Victoria's Secret.
she's a 34B, as in barely an D hing there. False advertising.
the truth is, she has a nice face.
I need to do something to take my mind off her.
easy enough, except I need an idea.
I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie.
so what if it's not even 10: 00 p. m. And it's a Tuesday night?
the Kirkland facebook is open on my desktop, and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics.
Billy Olson's sitting here and had the idea of putting some of the pictures next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on who's hotter.
good call, Mr. Olson.
Yeah, it's on. I'm not gonna do the farm animals, but I like the idea of comparing two people together.
it gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel since people's ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than, say, choosing a number to represent each person's hotness, like they do on hotornot. Com.
the first thing we're going to need is a lot of pictures.
unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook, so I'm going to have to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in.
let the hacking begin.
first up is Kirkland.
they keep everything open and allow indexes in their Apache configuration.
so a little Wget magic is all that's necessary to download the entire Kirkland facebook.
kids' stuff.
next is Eliot.
they're also open, but with no indexes on Apache.
I can run an empty search and it returns all of the images in the database in a single page.
and I can save the page and Mozilla will save all the images for me.
excellent. Moving right along.
excuse me! Everybody!
you are at one of the oldest, one of the most exclusive clubs, not just at Harvard, but in the world.
and I want to welcome you all to Phoenix Club's first party of the fall semester!
lowell has some security. They require a user name/password combo, and I'm gonna go ahead and say they don't have access to the main FAS user database, so they have no way of detecting an intrusion.
Adams has no security, but limits the number of results to 20 a page.
all I need to do is break out the same script I used on Lowell and we're set.
Quincy has no online facebook. What a sham.
nothing I can do about that.
dunster is intense.
not only is there no public directory, but there's no directory at all.
you have to do searches, and if your search returns more than 20 matches, nothing gets returned.
and once you do get results, they don't link directly to the images.
they link to a PHP that redirects or something. Weird.
this may be difficult. I'll come back later.
Hey, Shark Week's on. What?
great white, beautiful fish. Nice.
leverett is a little better. They still make you search, but you can do an empty search and get links to pages with every student's picture.
it's slightly obnoxious that they only let you view one picture at a time, and there's no way I'm going to go to 500 pages to download pics one at a time.
so it's definitely necessary to break out Emacs and modify that Perl script.
done.
Hey, what's going on?
perfect timing. Eduardo's here and he's going to have the key ingredient.
Hey, Mark. Wardo.
you and Erica split up.
how did you know that?
it's on your blog.
Yeah. Are you all right?
I need you. I'm here for you.
no, I need the algorithm you use to rank chess players.
are you okay? We're ranking girls.
you mean other students. Yeah.
you think this is such a good idea?
I need the algorithm. Mark...
I need the algorithm.
give each girl a base rating of 1400.
at any given time Girl A has a rating Ra and Girl B has a rating Rb.
when any two girls are matched up, there's an expectation of which will win based on their current rating, right?
Yeah. And those expectations are expressed this way.
let's write it.
one on the left.
the right.
Yeah, still the right.
it works. Who should we send it to first?
who are you gonna send it to? Just a couple of people.
the question is, who are they gonna send it to?
Hey, guys, check this out.
someone go to the left. Dude, do left.
look at these girls. Right or left?
left is hot. Left? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
right or left?
that's my roommate.
Oh, my God. The girl on the left.
this is pathetic.
right.
left.
left. Left?
Oh, shit.
he blogged about you.
you don't wanna read it.
left.
is this yours?
I stole it from a Tranny.
get the hell out of here!
left. One on the right.
left.
man, that's an awful lot of traffic.
you think maybe we shouldn't shut it down before we get into trouble?
Hello?
wait, wait, wait, wait. What?
at 4: 00 in the morning?
well, there's a very unusual amount of traffic to the switch at Kirkland.
you're saying it's unusual for 4: 00 in the morning?
no, this'd be unusual for halftime at the Super Bowl.
all right.
I gotta go in.
what's going on?
harvard's network is about to crash.
you don't think...
I do.
go see if it's everybody's.
I can't connect.
the network's down.
unless it's a coincidence, I think this is us.
it's not a coincidence.
holy shit.
so you were called in front of the Ad Board.
that's not what happened.
you weren't called in front of the Administrative Board?
no, back. I mean back at the bar with Erica Albright. She said all that?
mark... That I said that stuff to her?
I was reading from the transcript of her deposition.
Yeah, why would you even need to depose her?
that's really for us to decide.
you think if I know she can make me look like a jerk, I'll be more likely to settle.
why don't we stretch our legs for a minute?
can we do that? It's been almost three hours.
and frankly, you did spend an awful lot of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg with the girl's testimony from the bar.
I'm not embarrassed, she just made a lot of that up.
she was under oath.
then I guess that would be the first time somebody's lied under oath.
the site got 2, 200 hits within two hours?
thousand.
what?
Twentytwo thousand.
Wow.
these guys are just freakin' fast.
is there any way to make this a fair fight?
jump out and swim.
I think we'd have to jump out and drown.
well, you could row forward and I could row backward.
we're genetically identical. Science says we'd stay in one place.
just row the damn boat.
you guys hear about this? What?
two nights ago, a sophomore choked the network from a laptop at Kirkland.
Really? At 4: 00 a. m.
how?
he set up a website where you vote on the hotness of female undergrads.
what were we doing that none of us heard about this?
I don't know.
a three hour lowrate technical row before breakfast.
full course load. Studying.
another three hours in the tank and then studying.
I'm not sure how we missed it.
how much activity was there on this thing?
twenty-two thousand page requests.
cam, this guy hacked the facebook of seven houses.
he set up the whole website in one night, and he did it while he was drunk.
twenty-two thousand?
well, how do you know he was drunk? He was blogging simultaneously.
you know what I think? Way ahead of you.
this is our guy.
Cameron" spelled the usual way.
Tyler spelled the usual way, and my last name is the same as my brother's.
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is an Administrative Board hearing.
you're also charged with being in violation of university policy, on distribution of digitized images.
before we begin with our questioning, you're allowed to make a statement.
would you like to do so?
I...
you know, I've already apologized in The Crimson to the ABHW, to Fuerza Latina, and to any women at Harvard who may have been insulted, as I take it that they were.
as for any charges stemming from the breach of security,
I believe I deserve some recognition from this board.
I'm sorry? Yes.
I don't understand.
which part?
you deserve recognition?
I believe I've pointed out some pretty gaping holes in your system.
excuse me, may I? Yes.
Mr. Zuckerberg,
I'm in charge of security for all computers on the Harvard network, and I can assure you of its sophistication.
in fact, it was that level of sophistication that led us to you in less than four hours.
four hours? Yes, sir.
that would be impressive, except if you had known what you were looking for, you would have seen it written on my dorm room window.
so?
six months academic probation.
Wow. Well, they had to make an example out of you.
they had my blog.
I shouldn't have written that thing about the farm animals.
that was stupid.
but I was kidding, for God's sakes. Doesn't anybody have a sense of humor?
I tried to stop you. I know.
how do you do this thing where you manage to get all girls to hate us?
and why do I let you? I know.
you can't do that. Wardo, I said I know.
okay, let's look at a sample problem.
suppose we're given a computer with a 16bit virtual address and a page size of 256 bytes.
the system uses onelevel page tables that start at address hex 400.
maybe you want DMA on your 16bit system. Who knows?
the first few pages are reserved for hardware flags, etc.
assume pagetable entries have eight status bits.
the eight status bits would then be...
anybody?
and I see we have our first surrender.
don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg.
brighter men than you have tried and failed this class.
one valid bit, one modified bit, one reference bit and five permission bits.
that is correct.
does everybody see how he got there?
you Mark Zuckerberg? Yeah.
cameron Winklevoss. Hi.
Tyler Winklevoss.
are you guys related?
that's good. Funny.
we never heard that before.
so, what can I do for you? Did I insult your girlfriends?
no. You didn't. Actually, I don't know.
Yeah, we never asked. We should do that.
no.
we have an idea we want to talk to you about.
you got a minute?
you guys look like you spend some time at the gym.
we have to. Why?
we row crew.
Yeah, I've got a minute. Great.
so, you ever been inside the Porcellian? No.
you understand we can't take you past the bike room, because you're not a member.
I've heard.
you want a sandwich or something? Okay.
mark, right? Yeah.
mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner. Hi.
we were really impressed with Facemash.
when we checked you out, you also built CourseMatch.
I don't know CourseMatch.
you go online and see what courses your friends are taking.
it's really smart, man.
mark. Yeah.
we were talking about CourseMatch.
it was kind of a nobrainer.
but you invented something in high school, too, right?
an app for an MP3 player that recognizes your taste in music.
anybody try to buy it?
microsoft.
Wow. How much?
didn't sell it. Uploaded it for free.
for free? Yeah.
Why?
okay, well, we have something that we've been working on for a while and we think it's great.
it's called the Harvard Connection.
you create your own page. Interests, bio, friends, pics.
and then people can go online, see your bio, request to be your...
Yeah, how is that different from MySpace or Friendster?
Harvard. Edu is the most prestigious email address in the country, man.
I mean, the whole site's kind of based on the idea that girls...
not to put anything indelicately, but...
girls wanna go with guys who go to Harvard.
Divya and my brother don't have trouble putting things indelicately.
the main difference between what we're talking about and MySpace or Friendster, or any of those other social networking sites is...
is exclusivity. Right?
right. Yeah.
we'd love for you to work with us, Mark.
I mean, we need a gifted programmer who's creative.
and we know that you've been taking it in the shins.
women's groups are ready to declare a fatwa.
but, you know, this could help rehabilitate your image.
Wow. You would do that for me?
we'd like to work with you.
our first programmer graduated and went to work for Google.
our second programmer just got overwhelmed with schoolwork.
we would need you to build the site and write the code, and we'll provide all the...
I'm in.
what?
I'm in.
awesome.
that's what you said?
it was three or four years ago. I don't know what I said.
when did you come to Eduardo?
I don't understand that question.
do you remember answering in the affirmative?
the affirmative?
when did you come to Eduardo with the idea for Facebook?
it was called The Facebook then.
this doesn't need to be that difficult.
I'm currently in the middle of two different lawsuits.
did you answer affirmatively when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Narendra asked you to build Harvard Connection?
did you say yes?
I said I'd help.
when did you approach Mr. Saverin with the idea for The Facebook?
I wouldn't say I approached him.
Sy. You can answer the question.
at a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.
what's that?
the Jewish fraternity.
it was Caribbean Night.
it's not that guys like me are generally attracted to Asian girls.
it's that Asian girls are generally attracted to guys like me.
I'm developing an algorithm to define the connection between Jewish guys and Asian girls.
I don't think it's that complicated. They're hot, they're smart, they're not Jewish, and they can't dance.
Hey, Mark's here.
be right back.
I think I've come up with something.
hang on. I gotta tell you something that you're not gonna believe.
what?
I got punched by the Phoenix.
are you kidding? No.
I mean, it's just the first of a fourstep process, but they slid the invitation under my door tonight.
I go to my first punch party tomorrow.
so...
you got punched by the Phoenix.
Yeah, but, you know, it was probably just a diversity thing.
it was just a diversity thing. Just ride that horse until...
what did you wanna talk to me about?
mark? Yeah.
you said you'd come up with something.
Yeah, I think I've come up with something. Come outside and let's talk.
it's 20 degrees outside.
I can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls, which has absolutely nothing to do with the Caribbean.
people came to Facemash in a stampede, right?
Yeah.
but it wasn't because they saw pictures of hot girls.
you can go anywhere on the Internet and see pictures of hot girls.
Yeah.
it was because they saw pictures of girls that they knew.
people want to go on the Internet and check out their friends, so why not build a website that offers that?
friends, pictures, profiles, whatever you can visit.
browse around. Maybe it's someone you just met at a party.
but I'm not talking about a dating site.
I'm talking about taking the entire social experience of college and putting it online.
I can't feel my legs. I know.
I'm totally psyched about this, too. But, Wardo?
yeah?
it would be exclusive.
you would have to know the people on the site to get past your own page.
like getting punched.
now, that's good.
Wardo, it's like a final club, except we're the president.
I told him I thought it sounded great.
it was a great idea.
there was nothing to hack.
people were gonna provide their own pictures, their own information.
and people had the ability to invite, or not invite, their friends to join.
see, in a world where social structure was everything, that was the thing.
it was a big project, and he was going to have to write tens of thousands of lines of code, so I wondered why he was coming to me and not his roommates,
Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. They were programmers.
we're gonna need a little startup cash to rent the servers and get it online.
so that was why.
did he offer terms? Yes.
we'll split it, 70/30.
70 for me, 30 for you for putting up the $1, 000
and for handling everything on the business end. You're CFO.
and you said?
I said, "Let's do it.
okay. Did he add anything else?
Yes.
it probably was a diversity thing.
but so what?
why do you think he said that?
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting, but whose discovery is this?
sy, if you'll let me continue with my line of questioning.
what are you suggesting?
that I was jealous of Eduardo for getting punched by the Phoenix and began a plan to screw him out of a company
I hadn't even invented yet. Were you?
Gretchen. Jealous of Eduardo?
stop typing. We're off the record.
ma'am, I know you've done your homework, and so you know that money isn't a big part of my life.
but at the moment, I could buy Mount Auburn Street, take the Phoenix Club and turn it into my pingpong room.
I'll let you know how the party is.
we recognize that you're a plaintiff in one suit involving Facebook, and a witness in another.
Yes, sir.
at any time in the weeks prior to Mark's telling you his idea, did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss,
Divya Narendra or Harvard Connection?
Yes. He said they'd asked him to work on their site, but that he looked at what they had and decided it wasn't worth his time.
he said even his most pathetic friends knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys.
these guys," meaning my clients.
Yes. He resented... Mark resented that your clients thought that he needed to rehabilitate his image after Facemash.
but Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything.
with Facemash, he'd hacked into the Harvard computers, he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board, he'd gotten a lot of notoriety.
Facemash did exactly what he wanted it to do.
were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building The Facebook, he was also communicating with the plaintiffs?
not at the time, I wasn't. But...
it really didn't have much to do with the Winklevosses' dating site.
how would you know? You weren't even there.
were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building The Facebook, he was leading the plaintiffs to believe he was building Harvard Connection?
you're offering a conclusion not found in evidence.
we are about to find it in evidence.
from Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss.
november 30th, 2003.
I read over all the stuff you sent me re: Harvard Connection.
and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement.
so we can talk about it after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night.
from Mark Zuckerberg to Cameron Winklevoss. December 1 st, 2003.
sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just got about three of your missed calls.
I was working on a problem set for my systems class.
from Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.
december 10, 2003.
this week has been pretty busy thus far with classes and work, "so I think it's probably best to postpone the meeting.
I'm also really busy tomorrow.
okay, anybody else feel like there's something up with this guy?
tell him okay, but we do have to make sure that we meet up before we all go off for break.
I know, I know. Yeah, watch out.
Hey, Mark.
I need a dedicated Linux box running Apache with a MySQL back end.
it's gonna cost a little more money.
how much more? About 200 more.
do we need it? Gotta handle the traffic.
do it. I already did.
Hey, guess what?
I made the second cut.
that's good.
you should be proud of that right there. Don't worry if you don't make it any further.
I'll get out of here.
from Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Narendra.
december 15th, 2003.
I have a CS problem set that I'm just getting started with "and it should be about 15 hours of coding, so I'll be busy tomorrow night.
I won't really be free to meet until next Wednesday afternoon.
I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.
I've basically been in the lab this whole time, and also I...
...won't be able to do Saturday, as I have to meet up with my parents.
as the plaque reads, this is John Harvard, founder of Harvard University in 1638.
it's also called the Statue of Three Lies.
what are the three lies?
Mr. Dowd.
the three lies. First...
shit!
take your pants off. I know.
Mr. Saverin.
one, Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638.
two, Harvard was not founded by John Harvard.
and three, that is not John Harvard.
who is it?
it's a friend of the sculptor, Daniel Chester.
keep your jacket on.
Thirtynine days after Mr. Zuckerberg's initial meeting with my clients, and he still hadn't completed work on Harvard Connection.
but on January 11th, 2004,
Mr. Zuckerberg registered the domain name The Facebook via Network Solutions.
to the best of your knowledge, had he even begun work on Harvard Connection?
not to my knowledge. No.
what in the world is this?
Hey, Cameron, I'm still a little skeptical that we have enough functionality in the site "to really draw the attention and gain the critical mass necessary "to get a site like this to run"?
we'll speak soon"?
this is the first time he mentioned any problem?
Yes, it was.
you sent 36 emails to Mr. Zuckerberg and received 16 emails in return, and this was the first time he indicated he was not happy.
that's correct.
he had 42 days to study our system and get out ahead.
do you see any of your code on Facebook? Sy, could you...
did I use any of your code?
you stole our whole goddamn idea.
fellas. What? Match. com for Harvard guys?
can I continue with my deposition?
you know, you really don't need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this.
if you guys were the inventors of Facebook, you'd have invented Facebook.
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder and watch you write us a check.
no shit.
let's continue.
february 4, 2004.
there is a girl in your art history class. Her name is Stephanie Attis.
do you happen to know if she has a boyfriend?
have you ever seen her with anyone?
and, if not, do you happen to know if she's looking to go out with anyone?
people don't walk around with a sign on them that says...
we were supposed to meet at 9: 00.
have you slept yet? I have to add something.
what?
shit, that looks good. That looks really good.
it's clean and simple.
no Disneyland, no "live nude girls." But watch.
What'd you write?
relationship Status." "Interested In.
this is what drives life at college. "Are you having sex or aren't you?
it's why people take certain classes and sit where they sit and do what they do.
and at its center, you know, that's what The Facebook is gonna be about.
people are gonna log on because after all the cake and watermelon, there's a chance they're actually gonna...
gonna get laid. ...meet a girl. Yes.
that is really good.
and that was it.
what do you mean? It's ready.
it's ready? Right now? Yeah. That was it.
and here's the masthead.
you made a masthead. Yeah.
Eduardo Saverin, cofounder and CFO." Yeah.
you have no idea what that's gonna mean to my father.
sure I do.
so when's it going live?
right now. Get your laptop out.
what? Why do we need my laptop?
because you got emails for everybody at the Phoenix.
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool with them that I spam their emails.
this is not spam. No, I know it's not spam.
if we send it to our friends, it's just gonna bounce around Dworkin.
I haven't gotten in yet.
these guys know people. And I need their emails.
sure. Good.
give me the mailing list.
these guys.
Yeah, they're literary geniuses because the world's most obvious Lewis Carroll reference is in...
they're not so bad. I'm just saying.
Yeah, you're right.
the site's live.
you know, let's go get a drink and celebrate.
I'm buying.
mark, are you praying?
whatever happened to Cole Porter and Irving Berlin?
it's a Valentine's Day theme. They're playing love songs.
good point.
cause Cole Porter and Irving Berlin never wrote any love songs.
honey, you should put your laptop away.
seven different people spammed me the same link.
kc. What is it?
I don't know.
but I'm really hoping it's Cats That Look Like Hitler, 'cause I can never get enough of that.
no, it's not.
what?
this isn't mine.
okay, what is wrong?
it's fine. It's fine. It's fine.
Hey!
not now!
we need 20 minutes!
okay.
I just wanted to let you know that Zuckerberg stole our website.
he stole our website.
it's been live for more than 36 hours.
Mr. Hotchkiss? Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad.
Yes, sir, I'm here with my brother Tyler and our business partner Divya.
welcome to The Facebook.
the Facebook is an online directory that connects people "through different social networks.
you must have a harvard. Edu address to register.
Yeah, I called earlier. I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg.
Yes, sir. He's actually quoted a couple times.
I can read it to you.
everyone's been talking a lot about a universal facebook within Harvard,' he says.
he" meaning Mark.
I think it's kind of silly that it would take the university "'a couple of years to get around to it.
I can do a classier job than they can and I did it in a week."'
tell him Divya Narendra called.
I know, that's how he talks. Appreciate it.
as of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said, "over 650 students had registered to use thefacebook. Com.
he said he anticipated that 900 students would have joined the site by this morning.
Yeah, Divya was just reading that 650 students signed up for it on the first day.
God, if I was a drug dealer I couldn't give free drugs to 650 people in one day.
and this guy doesn't have three friends to rub together to make a fourth.
all right. Yes, that's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss.
we'll put all this together and we'll email it to you.
well, you won't be able to go on the website yourself.
because you don't have a Harvard...
you know what, it would just be easier for us to email it to you.
I'm sure you're right.
he's a good guy and he's very bright and I'm sure he didn't mean to do...
Wow.
...what he did.
all right, thank you very much. And, Dad...
all right, love you, too.
this is a good guy? We don't know that he's not a good guy.
we know he stole our idea.
we know he lied to our faces for a month and a half.
no, he never lied to our faces. Okay, he never saw our faces.
fine, he lied to our email accounts and he gave himself a 42day head start, because he knows what apparently you don't, which is that getting there first is everything.
I'm a competitive racer, Div.
I don't think you need to school me in the importance of getting there first. Thank you.
that was your father's lawyer? It was his inhouse counsel.
he's gonna look at all this and if he thinks it's appropriate he'll send a ceaseanddesist letter.
what's that gonna do?
what, do you wanna hire an IP lawyer and sue him?
no, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat the shit out of him with a hammer.
we don't even have to do that. That's right.
we could do that ourselves. I'm 6'5," 220, and there's two of me.
I'm with this guy. Well, whatever.
I'm saying, let's calm down until we know what we're talking about.
how much more information are you waiting for?
we met with Mark three times, we exchanged 52 emails, we can prove that he looked at the code.
what is that on the bottom of the page? It says "A Mark Zuckerberg production.
on the home page? On every page.
shit, I need a second to let the classiness waft over me.
okay, look, we don't know...
cam, they wrote, "Zuckerberg said he hoped the privacy options "would help restore his reputation "following student outrage over facemash. Com.
that's exactly what we said to him. He's giving us the finger in The Crimson.
while we're waiting for Dad's lawyer to look this stuff over, we can at least get something going in the paper so people know...
what? ...that this is in dispute.
we're not starting a knife fight in The Crimson.
and we're not suing anybody.
why not?
I don't understand, I don't understand. Why not?
he's gonna say it's stupid.
what, who, me?
say it. Why not?
because we're gentlemen of Harvard.
this is Harvard, where you don't plant stories and you don't sue people.
you thought he was gonna be the only one who thought that was stupid?
during the time when you say you had this idea, did you know Tyler and Cameron came from a family of means?
a family of means"?
did you know their father was wealthy?
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.
it's not important you be sure why I'm asking.
it's not important to you. Sy.
did you know that they came from money?
I had no idea whether they came from money or not.
in one of your emails to Mr. Narendra, you referenced Howard Winklevoss' consulting firm.
if you say so.
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose assets are in the hundreds of millions.
you also knew Tyler and Cameron were members of a Harvard final club called the Porcellian.
they pointed that out.
excuse us for inviting you in. To the bike room.
please. So it's safe to say you were aware that my clients had money.
Yes.
let me tell you why I'm asking.
I'm wondering why, if you needed $1, 000 for an Internet venture, you didn't ask my clients for it.
they had demonstrated an interest to you in that kind of thing.
I went to my friend for the money because that's who I wanted to be partners with.
Eduardo was the president of the Harvard Investors Association, and he was also my best friend.
your best friend is suing you for $600 million.
I didn't know that. Tell me more.
Eduardo, what happened after the initial launch?
I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind addressing him as Mr. Saverin?
Gretchen, they're best friends. Not anymore.
well, we already went through this on the... Never mind.
Mr. Saverin, what happened after the initial launch?
it exploded.
everybody on campus was using it.
facebook me" was a common expression after two weeks.
and Mark?
and Mark was the biggest thing on a campus that included 19 Nobel laureates, 15 Pulitzer Prize winners, two future Olympians, and a movie star.
who was the movie star?
does it matter?
no.
it was a beautiful day and I was in my Radcliffe dorm room.
he brought that magazine up and he showed it to me and he said, "Look, it's gonna happen without us. We've gotta start now.
and I said, "Okay. Let's get BASIC out there.
now, most of you think you know the rest of the story, but you may not.
the beginnings of this industry were very humble.
that kit computer on the cover of that magazine had an 8080 processor in it.
unless you paid extra for a 1 K memory board, you got 256 bytes.
so the challenge when I wrote BASIC wasn't just to run at 4 kbytes, but I also had to leave room for the users to run their programs in 4 kbytes.
your friend. Is that Mark Zuckerberg?
Yeah.
he made The Facebook. Yeah.
I mean, it's both of ours. We're...
Yeah, we... Yes.
cool.
I'm Christy Ling. This is Alice.
Hi.
well, very nice to meet you.
facebook me when you get home.
you know, maybe we can all go out and grab a drink.
certainly.
absolutely do that.
she said, "Facebook me and we can all go for a drink later,
which is stunningly great for two reasons.
one, she said "facebook me," right? And then the other is, well, you know...
they wanna have drinks later.
Yes, have you ever heard so many different good things packed into one regularsized sentence?
excuse me, Mark?
yeah?
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your OS lab.
sure.
awesome job with The Facebook. Awesome job.
Thanks.
I'm Bob. How you doing?
you know, I could swear he was looking at you when he said the next Bill Gates could be right in this room.
I doubt it.
and I showed up late. I don't even know who the speaker was.
it was Bill Gates.
shit, that makes sense.
all right. Thanks, guys.
are you a moron? Are you medically stupid?
you can't tell Bill Gates is in front of you for an hour?
I wasn't wearing my contacts.
can I get a Glock and kill you?
it's time to monetize the thing.
what were their names?
hear what I just said? When?
I said it's time to monetize the site.
what does that mean?
it means it's time for the website to start generating revenue.
no, I know what the word means. I'm asking how you wanna do it.
advertising. No.
well, we got 4, 000 members.
cause The Facebook is cool, and if we start installing popups for Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool.
well, I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew, but at some point, and I'm talking as the business end of the company, the site...
we don't even know what it is yet. We don't know what it is.
we don't know what it can be. We don't know what it will be.
we know that it is cool.
that is a priceless asset I'm not giving up.
so when will it be finished? It won't be finished.
that's the point. The way fashion's never finished.
what? Fashion. Fashion is never finished.
you're talking about fashion? Really, you?
I'm talking about the idea of it and I'm saying that it's never finished.
okay. But they manage to make money selling pants.
mark, what is this?
what? This.
it's called a ceaseanddesist letter. What were their names?
who? The girls.
when did you get this?
about 10 days ago. Right after we launched the site.
Jesus Christ. Hey, the girls. What were their names?
the Winklevoss twins are saying that you stole their idea.
I find that to be a little more than mildly annoying.
Oh, well, they find it to be intellectual property theft.
look... Why didn't you show this to me?
it was addressed to me.
they're saying that we stole The Facebook from Divya Narendra and the Winklevosses.
I know what it says. Did we?
did we what?
don't screw around with me now. Look at me.
the letter says we could face legal action.
no, it says I could face legal action.
this is from a lawyer, Mark. They must feel they have some grounds.
the lawyer is their father's house counsel. Do they have grounds?
the grounds are our thing is cool and popular, and Harvard Connection is lame.
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code, I promise.
I didn't use anything.
look, a guy who builds a nice chair doesn't owe money to everyone who ever has built a chair, okay?
they came to me with an idea, I had a better one.
why didn't you show me this letter? I didn't think it was a big deal.
okay.
so if there's something wrong, if there's ever anything wrong, you can tell me.
I'm the guy that wants to help. This is our thing.
now, is there anything that you need to tell me?
no.
what are we doing about this?
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services and he told me to write them back.
and what did you say?
when we met in January, I expressed my doubts about the site.
where it stood with graphics, how much programing was left "that I had not anticipated.
the lack of hardware we had to deal with site use, "the lack of promotion that would go on to successfully launch the website.
this was the first time you raised any of those concerns, right?
I'd raised concerns before.
bullshit. Not to us.
gentlemen, I'm talking about at the meeting in January to which this letter is referring.
Yeah.
let me rephrase this.
you sent my client 16 emails. In the first 15 you didn't raise any concerns.
is that a question?
in the 16th email you raised concerns about the site's functionality.
were you leading them on for six weeks? No.
then why didn't you raise any of these concerns before?
it's raining. I'm sorry?
it just started raining.
Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?
no.
do you think I deserve it?
what?
do you think I deserve your full attention?
I had to swear an oath before we began this deposition and I don't wanna perjure myself, so I have a legal obligation to say no.
okay. No. You don't think I deserve your attention?
I think if your clients wanna sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall, they have a right to give it a try, but there's no requirement that I enjoy sitting here listening to people lie.
you have part of my attention. You have the minimum amount.
the rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook, where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing.
did I adequately answer your condescending question?
well, I have 12: 45. Why don't we say that's lunch?
back at 2: 30.
so what were their names?
their names were Christy and Alice, and they wanna have drinks tonight.
Wow.
Oh, my God.
I don't care.
Hey, man, sorry.
a couple girls are freshening up in there.
sweet.
we have groupies.
I'll be right back.
mark, where you going? Mark.
Hi.
I saw you from over there. I didn't know you came to this club a lot.
first time. Mine, too.
could I talk to you alone for a second?
I think I'm good right here.
I just... I'd love to talk to you alone if we could just go someplace.
right here is fine.
I don't know if you heard about this new website I launched.
no.
the Facebook? You called me a bitch on the Internet, Mark.
that's why I wanted to talk to you.
on the Internet. That's why I came over.
comparing women to farm animals.
I didn't end up doing that.
it didn't stop you from writing it.
as if every thought that tumbles through your head was so clever it would be a crime for it not to be shared.
the Internet's not written in pencil, Mark, it's written in ink, and you published that Erica Albright was a bitch, right before you made some ignorant crack about my family's name, my bra size, and then rated women based on their hotness.
Erica, is there a problem? No, there's no problem.
you write your snide bullshit from a dark room because that's what the angry do nowadays.
I was nice to you. Don't torture me for it.
if we could just go somewhere for a minute...
I don't wanna be rude to my friends.
okay.
good luck with your video game.
Hey, that was great. That was the right thing to do.
you apologized, right?
we have to expand.
sure. Mark?
is he mad about something?
okay, we are expanding to Yale and Columbia.
Dustin, I want you to share the coding work with me.
Chris, you're gonna be in charge of publicity and outreach, and you could start by getting a story in the BU student newspaper.
it's The Bridge.
they hate doing stories about Harvard.
somebody at the newspaper will be a computer science major.
tell them that Mark Zuckerberg will do 10 hours of free programing.
why do you want a story in the BU newspaper?
because I do. Now here's the arrangement.
Eduardo is CFO and owns 30% of the company.
Dustin is vice president and head of programing, and his 5% of the company will come from my end.
Chris is director of publicity, and his compensation will depend on how much work he ends up doing.
any questions?
who are the girls? Sorry. They're Christy and Alice.
Hi. Hi.
hello. Hi.
is there anything we can do?
no, that's it.
Yale and Columbia, let's go. And Stanford.
what? Stanford.
it's time for them to see this in Palo Alto.
you don't want any lunch?
no.
you're welcome to some salad.
no, thank you.
this must be hard.
who are you?
I'm Marylin Delpy. I introduced myself when we first...
I mean, what do you do?
I'm a second year associate at the firm.
my boss wanted me to sit in on the deposition phase.
what are you doing?
checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.
Bosnia.
they don't have roads, but they have Facebook.
you must really hate the Winklevosses.
I don't hate anybody.
the Winklevi aren't suing me for intellectual property theft.
they are suing me because for the first time in their lives, things didn't work out the way they were supposed to for them.
he's expanding.
what?
he's expanding to Yale, Columbia and Stanford.
it's gonna be in The Crimson tomorrow.
Really? Yep.
well, looks like that ceaseanddesist letter really scared the shit out of him, huh?
I wanna hire a lawyer to file for injunctive relief and get the site taken down now.
every minute the site is up, Harvard Connection becomes less valuable.
I want an injunction. I want damages. I want punitive relief.
and I want him dead.
Yeah, I want those things, too.
then why aren't we doing anything about it?
because we're gentlemen of Harvard?
no, it's because you're not thinking how it's gonna look.
how's it gonna look?
like my brother and I are in skeleton costumes chasing the Karate Kid around a high school gym.
cam, he's violated Massachusetts state law.
when he goes to Connecticut, New York and California, he'll have violated federal law.
and, by the way, he's in violation of Harvard law.
there's no such thing as Harvard law.
wait. Yeah, there is.
harvard Student Handbook.
every freshman is issued one of these, and somewhere in this book it says...
you can't steal from another student.
this is what we needed. We're going to Summers.
well, you can't get a meeting with Larry Summers.
my brother and I, we pay tuition at this school.
we carry a 3. 9 GPA at this school. We've won trophies for this school.
and we'll be rowing in the Olympics for this school.
I want a meeting with the goddamn president of this school.
why Stanford?
why do you think?
I'm sorry.
I'm late for biochem.
okay.
you don't know my name, do you?
is it Stanford?
I should just kick your ass.
how do you go to a party and you meet someone...
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy. You're from Orinda.
your father's in commercial real estate and your mother's 10 years sober.
what's my major?
trombone. Really?
I remember something about a trombone.
French.
your major's French.
and yours? Mine?
I don't have one. You haven't declared?
I don't go to school.
you're kidding. No.
well, where did you go to school?
william Taft Elementary, for a little while.
Seriously?
you're not like 15 years old or anything, are you?
no.
wait, you're not like 15, are you?
no.
so, what do you do?
I'm an entrepreneur.
you're unemployed. I wouldn't say that.
what would you say?
that I'm an entrepreneur.
well, then, what was your latest preneur?
well, I founded an Internet company that let folks download and share music for free.
kind of like Napster?
exactly like Napster.
what do you mean?
I founded Napster.
Sean Parker founded Napster.
nice to meet you.
you're Sean Parker?
you see, the shoe's on the other...
foot? Table, which has turned.
I just slept with Sean Parker?
you just slept on Sean Parker.
you're a zillionaire. Not technically.
what are you?
broke. There's not a lot of money in free music, even less when you're being sued by everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.
this is blowing my mind.
I appreciate that.
I gotta hop in the shower and get ready for class.
Biochem, even though you're a French major whose name is Amy.
you passed.
I'm a hard worker.
there's juice or anything else you can find. Help yourself.
you mind if I check my email?
Yeah, go ahead.
Jesus.
Amy! Can you come out here? Yeah?
just a second.
there's a snake in here, Amy.
what?
where?
there isn't a snake, but I need to ask you something.
are you kidding me? I could've been killed.
how?
by running too fast and getting twisted in the curtain.
what do you need to ask me?
Yeah, I went to check my email and there's a website open on your computer.
Yeah, after you passed out last night I went on The Facebook for a little bit.
what's that? The Facebook?
stanford's had it for, like, two weeks now.
it's really awesome, except it's freakishly addictive.
seriously, I'm on the thing like five times a day.
mind if I send myself an email?
Yeah, is everything okay?
everything's great.
I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.
I've never been in this building before.
this building's 100 years older than the country it's in, so do be careful.
we're sitting in chairs.
Yes.
very good. You can go in now.
that's their own stupidity. I should've been there.
well, darkness is the absence of light, and the stupidity in that instance was the absence of me.
Catherine, I've got students in my office now.
students. Undergrads.
I don't know.
from the looks of it, they want to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.
all right, byebye.
good morning. Good morning, sir.
I'm Cameron Winklevoss and this is my brother, Tyler.
and you're here because...
either of you can answer.
I'm sorry, sir, I thought you were reading the letter.
I've read the letter.
well, we came up with an idea for a website called Harvard Connection...
we've since changed the name to ConnectU. And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea...
I understand.
and I'm asking what you want me to do about it.
well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook, which is distributed to each freshman, under the heading "Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community,
it says the college expects all students to be honest and forthcoming in their dealings with members in this community.
students are required to respect public and private ownership, and instances of theft, misappropriation or...
Anne? Yes, sir?
punch me in the face. Go ahead.
...or unauthorized use will result in disciplinary action, including the requirement to withdraw from the college.
and you memorized that instead of doing what?
what my brother and I came here today to ask of you, respectfully, of course...
sir, it's against university rules to steal from another student, plain and simple.
and you've spoken to your House Master?
Yes, sir. And the House Master made a recommendation to the Ad Board, but the Ad Board won't see us.
have you tried dealing with the other student directly?
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding to any of our emails or phone calls for the last two weeks.
he doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland, and the closest I've come to dealing with him facetoface is when I saw him on the quad and chased him through Harvard Square.
you chased him?
I saw him and I know he saw me. I went after him and then he disappeared.
I don't see this as a university issue. Of course this is a university issue.
there's a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both.
you enter into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other.
I'm sorry, President Summers, but what you just said makes no sense to me at all.
I'm devastated by that.
what my brother means is, if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer, that would be a university issue.
I really don't know. This office doesn't handle petty larceny.
this isn't petty larceny.
this idea is potentially worth millions of dollars.
millions? Yes.
you might just be letting your imaginations run away with you.
sir, I honestly don't think you're in any position to make that call.
I was the US Treasury Secretary. I'm in some position to make that call.
letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told to do in your freshman address.
well, then I would suggest that you let your imaginations run away with you on a new project.
you would?
Yes. Everyone at Harvard's inventing something.
harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than finding a job.
so I'll suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project.
I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point. Please, arrive at the point.
you don't have to be an intellectual property expert to understand the difference between right and wrong.
and you're saying that I don't?
of course I'm not saying that, sir. I'm saying that.
Really? Sir.
Anne, how did they get this appointment?
colleagues of their father.
let me tell you something, Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss, since you're on the subject of right and wrong.
this action, this meeting, the two of you being here is wrong.
it's not worthy of Harvard. It's not what Harvard saw in you.
you don't get special treatment.
we never asked... Just start another project?
like we're making a diorama for a science fair?
if you have a problem with that, Mr. Winklevoss...
we never asked for special treatment.
...the courts are always at your disposal. Is there anything else I can do for you?
you can take the Harvard Student Handbook and shove it...
thank you very much for your time, sir.
Whoops.
broke your 335 year old doorknob.
Eduardo, spring break, you and Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.
Yes. What was the purpose of the trip?
well, as CFO, I had set up some meetings with potential advertisers.
who paid for the trip?
it was paid for out of the $1, 000 account I had set up a few months earlier.
at this point, your $1, 000 was the only money that had been put into the company?
Yes. How did you feel the meetings went?
they went terribly. Why?
mark was asleep.
I was not asleep.
can I rephrase my answer?
I wish he'd been asleep.
so we're in 29 schools now, with over 75, 000 members.
people who go on The Facebook tend to stay on longer than almost any other website.
now, here's the most impressive statistic.
91% of people who try it once will come back.
now, if you'll allow me... Excuse me one second.
what sound is he making? Is that like a tsk?
it wasn't a tsk.
it was...
like a glottal stop.
almost a gag reflex.
guys, what is this?
there was one more meeting scheduled for the New York trip.
Yes, it was a dinner.
it was set up through my girlfriend at the time.
would you say that Mark was excited about this meeting?
Yes. Very.
look, they're not gonna card us. They might.
I mean, look around. It'll be embarrassing.
tell him they're not gonna card us. They're not gonna card us.
mark... Are you gonna talk about ads again?
unless you're the ballet theater of Hartford, the purpose of a business is to make a profit.
it isn't a business yet.
that's tough for me, 'cause my... Never mind.
he's 25 minutes late.
he founded Napster when he was 19. He can be late.
he's not a god. Then what is he?
he's 25 minutes late.
I think Wardo's jealous.
I honestly wasn't jealous. I was nervous.
Why?
well, I didn't know him at all, but I had done a search and I'd asked around.
and he struck me as kind of a...
a wild card.
Why?
he crashed out of two pretty big Internet companies in spectacular fashion, he's had a reputation with drugs...
he also founded the companies.
we don't need him.
he's here.
no, no, take your time.
and he does own a watch. Stop it.
I'm Sean Parker. How do you do?
you must be Eduardo. And Christy. And Mark.
great to meet you. Great to meet you.
you guys don't have anything in front of you.
we were waiting.
Hey, baby boy. Can you bring out some things?
the lacquered pork with that ginger confit. Tuna tartare?
and the lobster claws, that'll get us started.
Christy, what do you like to drink?
an appletini.
great. Four of those.
from that point on, it was a Seanathon.
the question was, "What did you talk about?
he took us through his episode with Napster.
I didn't wanna spend my 20s as a professional defendant.
who knew? The music industry doesn't have a sense of humor.
we tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said we owed in royalties, but I guess to them that was a little like selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas.
so we said screw it, declared bankruptcy.
but you made a name for yourself. And you are dry.
Tori! No, no, I'm good.
and then he went on to his second business venture, which was an online Rolodex that he got thrown out of by Case Equity.
and I wanted to do it nice this time.
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes, but nobody wants to take orders from a kid.
so let me tell you what happens to a 20yearold at the top of a hot dotcom.
I'm not a psychiatrist, but... I'm glad we've got that on the record.
you're not a psychiatrist, but what?
a psychiatrist would say that he was paranoid.
they'll hire private detectives who'll follow you day and night.
you're a target for highpriced escorts.
I can't prove it, but I know they tap my phones.
whatever it is that's gonna trip you up, you've done already.
private behavior is a relic of a time gone by.
and if somehow, someway, you've managed to live your life like the Dalai Lama, they'll make shit up.
because they don't want you, they want your idea.
and they want you to say "thank you" while you...
excuse me.
...wipe your chin and walk away.
that's what happened to you?
and delusional.
Yes. But there'll be payback at Case.
I brought down the record companies with Napster and Case'll suffer for their sins, too.
sorry, you didn't bring down the record companies.
they won.
in court. Yeah.
you wanna buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?
and he told story after story about life in Silicon Valley, and parties at Stanford and down in LA, and friends who'd become millionaires...
but mostly how Mark had to... He had to come to California.
and then he got around to The Facebook.
so, tell me about your progress.
well, we're in 29 schools now. We got over 75, 000 members.
tell me about the strategy you're using. Okay.
for instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas, but Baylor already had a social network on campus.
so instead of going right after them, we made a list of every school within 100 miles...
you put The Facebook on those campuses first.
pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw their friends on our site and we were in.
it's called the Little Bighorn. That's smart, Mark.
Thanks, that was mine. Easy.
Hey, you know what? Settle an argument for us.
I say it's time to start making money from The Facebook, but Mark doesn't want advertising. Who's right?
well...
neither of you yet.
the Facebook is cool, that's what it's got going for it.
Yeah.
you don't wanna ruin it with ads because ads aren't cool.
exactly.
it's like you're throwing the greatest party on campus and someone's saying it's gotta be over by 11: 00.
that's exactly right.
you don't even know what the thing is yet. Exactly.
how big it can get, how far it can go. This is no time to take your chips down.
a million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool?
you?
a billion dollars.
and that shut everybody up.
and that's where you're headed. A billion dollar valuation.
unless you take bad advice, in which case you may as well have come up with a chain of very successful yogurt shops.
when you go fishing, you can catch a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.
you ever walk into a guy's den and see a picture of him standing next to 14 trout?
no, he's holding a 3, 000pound marlin. Yep.
that's a good analogy. Okay.
but we all know marlins don't really weigh 3, 000 pounds, right?
have you seen the big ones up close?
no, but I don't think the guy's holding a marlin the size of a Range Rover.
that would be a really big fish and a very strong guy.
you think we might be getting away from the point?
I don't have a dog in this fight. I'm just a fan who came to say hi.
he owned Mark after that dinner.
he picked up the check, he told Mark they'd talk again soon, and he was gone.
but not before he made his biggest contribution to the company.
drop the "The." Just "Facebook.
it's cleaner.
shit.
goodbye, sweetie.
Yeah.
that's gotta be some kind of land speed record for talking.
you wanna end the party at 11: 00.
I'm trying to pay for the party. There won't be a party unless it's cool.
so, what do you think?
Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The.
I meant to catching the marlin instead of the 14 trout.
doesn't that sound good?
if you're a trout.
I'm going to enter this into the record.
incorporation papers for Facebook, an LLC registered in Florida.
why Florida? It's where my family lives.
and ask the respondent to stipulate that the articles of incorporation state the ownership as follows: 65% for Mark Zuckerberg, 30% for Eduardo Saverin and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz.
Yeah, we stipulate.
and that was April 13th, 2004. You can mark it.
you have anything here?
Yes. Thank you.
Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything that might be considered legitimate grounds for termination?
no.
you never did anything to embarrass the company or even seriously jeopardize it?
no. No?
no.
you were accused of animal cruelty.
wait. You weren't?
this is not happening.
I have here an article from The Crimson...
Jesus Christ.
I can't have this, Wardo.
come on, man. This is bullshit. This is another club playing a prank.
I'd gotten into the Phoenix.
I'd been accepted, and as part of my initiation I had to, for one week, carry with me at all times and take care of a chicken.
they identify you as one of the founders of Facebook.
junior Eduardo Saverin...
I'm not the expert, but being connected to torturing animals is probably bad for business.
I did not torture the chicken. I don't torture chickens. Are you crazy?
no, and settle down, please. I have here an article from The Crimson...
this is scathing. 956.
I was having dinner in the Kirkland dining hall with Mark, and I had the chicken with me, because I had to have the chicken with me at all times.
this was college.
somebody's gonna have to answer for this. 969.
and the dining hall was serving chicken for dinner, and I had to feed my chicken, so I...
well, I took little pieces of chicken and I gave it to the chicken.
someone must have seen me, because the next thing I knew
I was being accused of forced cannibalism.
I didn't know you couldn't do that.
I dealt with the various animal rights groups,
I dealt with the associate dean of the college.
this was all resolved.
988
someone from the Porc or the Fly must have reported it.
for all I know, it was the Winklevosses.
all right, let's just forget about it.
this is absurd. I'm being accused of animal cruelty.
it's better to be accused of necrophilia.
it is better to be accused of necrophilia.
now I have to explain this to my father. I'm gonna have to explain this to everybody.
what is happening on that?
I have my final coming up for Postwar and Contemporary Art and I haven't been to class.
I'm supposed to write about these four paintings.
that's a Facebook page?
Yeah. I opened it under an alias.
I posted the paintings and asked people to comment.
every once in a while, I hop on and stir the pot to get a good debate going.
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating on his final exam?
I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen. And why not?
because I'm not suing him for cheating on his final exam.
that's not what friends do. Well, you just told us he was cheating.
Oops.
you told your lawyers I was torturing animals?
no, he didn't tell us about it at all.
our litigators are capable of finding a Crimson article.
in fact, when we raised the subject with him, he defended you.
Oops.
993. We are so close.
Yeah, that reminds me, we're gonna need more money, Wardo.
Yeah, no, I agree. More servers, more help.
I'm interviewing two interns to come to Palo Alto and we're gonna have to pay them something.
sorry, what? I already found a house for rent on a street two blocks from the Stanford campus.
it is perfect and it's got a pool.
when did you decide to go to California for the summer?
you mean when did I actually decide?
was it somewhere in the middle of the Sean Parker Variety Hour?
he was right, California's the place we've gotta be.
what, you're Jed Clampett?
I didn't know you guys got The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil.
Yeah, got the show in Brazil, it was genius.
what is your problem with Sean? He doesn't bring anything to the table.
he doesn't have money. Dustin's a better programmer.
he's got connections to VCs. We don't need VCs, we need advertisers.
and I have connections to VCs. No real players. Look.
and as somebody who's just really embarrassed the company in a bad way...
it was the Winklevosses, Mark. Hang on.
hit "Refresh.
150004
150, 000 members, Wardo.
congratulations, dude. Congratulations.
you don't think it was strange that he was followed by private detectives?
who came up with nothing.
enough to get him out of the company. The drugs, the girls.
we don't know that any of that's true. You can read about it.
I can read about you torturing birds. Since when...
okay, don't fish eat other fish? The marlins and the trout?
what's he talking about?
I'm interviewing interns at 10: 00 tomorrow night in the CS lab.
get on board with this, man.
you know, I don't really know what else to say.
you can do one more! One more!
yo! Mark!
what's going on?
they have 10 minutes to get root access to a Python web server, expose its SSL encryption, and then intercept all traffic over its secure port.
they're hacking.
Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall Emulator. But here's the beauty.
you know I didn't understand anything you just said, right?
I do know that. So what's the beauty?
every tenth line of code written, they have to drink a shot.
Hacking's supposed to be stealth, so every time the server detects an intrusion, the candidate responsible has to drink a shot.
I also have a program running that has a popup window appear simultaneously on all five computers.
the last candidate to hit the window has to drink a shot.
Plus, every three minutes they all have to drink a shot.
three minutes! Drink one now!
Hey, can I ask, what part of the intern's job will they need to be able to do drunk?
you're right.
a more relevant test might be seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.
that was mean. Here.
what is this?
I opened a new account and put $18, 000 in it.
will that get you through the summer?
here! Mark?
right here!
welcome to Facebook.
$18, 000? Yes.
in addition to the $1, 000 you'd already put up.
Yes. A total of $19, 000 now.
Yes. Hang on.
I'm just checking your math on that.
Yes, I got the same thing.
may I continue?
after expressing misgivings about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company and moving it to California for the summer, why did you put $18, 000 in an account for his use?
I figured we were partners. I wanted to be a team player.
I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns could work on the site while I was generating advertiser interest in New York.
but mostly I figured, how much could possibly go wrong in three months?
go, go, go, go, go.
I didn't die. I know.
I made it. You did.
okay, ready?
that was like an 8. That was like a 2.
it was better than that. Yeah.
I'm okay.
you sure? Yeah.
Yikes.
that's the doorbell.
I didn't know we had a doorbell.
Andrew, get the door! No, he's wired in.
that's gonna cut into your security deposit.
Andrew. Not now.
good boy.
do you live here? Yeah.
do you?
we were right across the street. We saw the chimney...
is anybody hurt? No. You live across the street?
I'm Sharon.
this is my... Sharon. She lives across the street.
I was helping her move out, we saw the chimney...
we had a zip line to the pool.
you came to California.
Yeah.
you made the right choice.
here you go.
I'm so sorry.
no problem. I didn't know you were gonna...
here you go. No, no, no. Wait!
this house and this team are great. It's exactly what it should be.
I'm Sean Parker.
Oh, he's wired in.
that's what I'm talking about.
Where's Eduardo?
he got an internship in New York.
Eduardo didn't come out?
I was crashing there for a little bit while I'm taking care of some things, but she's done for the summer so she's back at her parents' place.
the homeless rock star of Palo Alto. All right.
what's your plan for the summer?
I'm sorry. I was looking at the architecture.
I asked what your plan for the...
a hundred schools by the end of the summer.
we're gonna go to the restroom. Okay.
Yeah, I'll go with you.
your date looks so familiar to me.
she looks familiar to a lot of people.
what do you mean?
a Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond wants to buy his wife some lingerie, but he's too embarrassed to shop for it in a department store.
he comes up with an idea for a highend place that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.
he gets a $40, 000 bank loan, borrows another 40, 000 from his inlaws, opens a store and calls it Victoria's Secret.
makes a half million dollars his first year.
starts a catalog, opens three more stores, and after five years, he sells the company to Leslie Wexner and The Limited for $4 million.
happy ending, right?
except two years later, the company's worth $500 million, and Roy Raymond jumps off the Golden Gate Bridge.
poor guy just wanted to buy his wife a pair of thighhighs, you know?
was that a parable?
my date's a Victoria's Secret model. That's why she looks familiar to you.
God. Don't be impressed by all this.
I read your blog.
you know, no, that was for web cretins.
you know why I started Napster?
the girl I loved in high school was with the cocaptain of the varsity lacrosse team, and I wanted to take her from him.
so I decided to come up with the next big thing.
I didn't know that. Napster wasn't a failure.
I changed the music industry for better and for always.
it may not have been good business, but it pissed a lot of people off.
and isn't that what your Facemash was about?
they're scared of me, pal, and they're gonna be scared of you.
what the VCs want is to say, "Good idea, kid, the grownups will take it from here.
but not this time. This is our time.
this time, you're gonna hand them a business card that says, "I'm CEO, bitch.
that's what I want for you.
so where the hell is Eduardo?
he's in New York. Sucking up to ad execs.
he's got an... An internship.
the company's here. A billiondollar company's here.
do you live and breathe Facebook? Yes.
I know you do.
Wardo wants to be a businessman and for all I know he's gonna be a good one, but he shouldn't be in New York kissing Madison Avenue's ass.
this is a once in a generation, "holy shit" idea.
and the water under the Golden Gate is freezing cold.
look at my face and tell me I don't know what I'm talking about.
do you ever think about that girl?
what girl?
the girl from high school with the lacrosse thing.
no.
if you guys are gonna talk about bandwidth, we need shots.
a hundred schools by the end of the summer?
Yeah.
tell you what. Gesture of good faith.
while you're getting into 100 schools, I'll put you on two continents.
two...
if you don't have a place to crash,
I think you should definitely come and live with us.
let's line up some shots.
excuse me! Yes, sir.
you can take this away and bring back the 1942.
absolutely, Mr. Parker.
attention... Go!
at the barrier, Hollandia is leading Harvard University by one length.
approaching the grandstands,
Hollandia maintains a lead of three quarters of a length.
come on!
whatever.
Mr. Winklevoss. Tyler.
tremendous race. Thank you.
and this is my brother, Cameron. Excellent.
sir?
his Royal Highness Prince Albert.
your Highness, this is Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.
of course. Brilliant race. I've never seen a race that close.
Yes, Your Highness.
my grandfather, Jack Kelly, was one of the premier rowers of his day.
I've been coming to Henley for 30 years and I'd never seen a race that close.
have you? Have you seen a race that close?
no, Your Highness.
mile and a half races are more commonly won by a boat length or two.
Yes, that's absolutely right. Brutally close.
may I introduce my teammates?
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse us.
on to the Dutch.
sorry you flew all the way out here to see that.
wouldn't have missed it, brother. How was the royalty?
I just wanted him to tell me a couple more times how close the race was.
just brutal, brutally close. Brutally excruciating. Jesus.
the guy is the prince of a country the size of Nantucket.
relax, it's fine.
boys. Divya. Dad.
Mr. Winklevoss. That was a tough beat.
I'm sorry that you and Mom had to fly out here to see that.
no, don't ever apologize to me for losing a race like that.
don't ever apologize to anyone for losing a race like that.
boys. Mr. Kenwright.
dad, this is Mr. Kenwright, head of the host family for this week.
pleasure to meet you. Good to meet you.
I've just had a phone chat with my daughter.
she told me that she and her friends are already talking about the race, which they've just seen via their computers.
a new website called Facebook. Do you have this in America?
I'm gonna find your mother.
have I said something wrong?
your daughter doesn't go to school in the States?
no, no. Cambridge.
majoring in French literature, though I wasn't aware there was such a thing.
and they have Facebook at Cambridge?
and apparently Oxford and the London School of Economics.
that's where her friends are.
that's awesome.
good race, boys. Take the bitter with the better, eh?
I'm gonna go watch the race film.
if this is online, I wanna see it.
stop it.
stop it, Cam.
knock it off.
I don't mind that we lost to the Dutch today by less than a second.
that was a good race, and that was a fair race.
and they'll see us again.
what I mind, and what you should mind, is showing up on Monday for a race that was run on Sunday.
we tried talking to him ourselves, we tried writing a letter, we tried the Ad Board, and we tried talking to the president of the university.
now, I am asking you for the last time, let's take the considerable resources at our disposal and sue him in federal court.
come on.
I need a real drink.
screw it.
let's gut the friggin' nerd.
that's what I'm talking about!
no, no, no, no, no.
but check it out, I saw him today.
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham, my Case Equity guy.
hang on.
are you guys using Spikes or Ghost Missiles?
we don't know, we're just shooting at each other.
use Sweet Kamikazes.
like we know what that is.
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera and he saw me, too.
I know he did.
don't. Don't sweat it. I'm on a landline.
bong hit.
does anybody hear that banging?
you don't hear anything. You're writing code.
dude, somebody's at the door.
it's not a dish best served cold. It's best served immediately and relentlessly.
I'm gonna call you back.
what's up?
mark was supposed to pick me up at the airport an hour ago.
I've been calling his cell.
he was on a 36hour coding tear, so he took a nap for a couple of hours.
what happened here?
not happened. Happening. The next big thing.
Hey, man.
back to work. Okay.
the more bad I get at this, the more wasted I get.
I mean the more wasted that I get...
we understand.
how old are they, Sean?
it's not polite to ask.
Sean, how old are they?
you think you know me, right?
I've read enough.
you know how much I've read about you?
nothing.
Wardo. Hey, man.
I waited an hour for you at the airport. What time is it?
it's midnight. Or 3: 00 a. m. In New York, where I just came from.
you gotta see some of the new stuff we got. Hey, Dustin. Show him the Wall.
I'm just calling it the Wall.
forget the Wall, tell him about the meeting I've got set up.
you know Peter Thiel?
Nope. No reason you should.
he just runs a $2billion hedge fund called Clarium Capital.
Why's he setting up meetings?
thiel might wanna make an angel investment.
I don't care if he's an actual angel. Why is he setting up business meetings?
you've had a long flight. No, I had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK, then a long wait at the passenger loading and unloading zone at SFO, and in between there was a long flight.
I'm the business end of this company.
and he is a house guest living here rent free on a very generous grant from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.
I heard about your big ticket ad buys. Gary's Tuxedos.
Hey, man... Harvard Bartending Course.
you're just a small step away from bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.
you wanna talk to me alone for a minute? Sure.
bong hit.
I'm so high. No, you're not.
so how's it going?
how's the internship? How's Christy?
how's the internship? Yeah.
mark, Jesus, I quit the internship.
we talked about this on the phone. I quit on my first day.
I do remember you saying that.
so how is Christy?
Christy's crazy.
is that fun? No.
I mean, she's actually psychotic.
she's insanely jealous, she's irrational, and I'm frightened of her.
still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.
I do not want that guy representing himself as part of this company.
you gotta move out here, Wardo, this is where it's all happening.
did you hear what I just said? The connections, the energy...
mark, you got...
I'm afraid if you don't come out here, you're gonna get left behind.
I want... I need you out here.
please don't tell him I said that. What did you just say?
it's moving faster than any of us ever imagined it would.
it's moving fast. What did you mean?
and Sean thinks we have... Sean is not part of this company.
we have over 300, 000 members, Wardo, and we're in 160 schools, including five in Europe.
I'm aware of that! Mark, I am the CFO!
we need more servers than I ever expected we'd need.
we need more programmers and we need more money, and he set up the Thiel meeting. He set up meetings all over town.
he set up other meetings? Yes.
without me knowing anything about it. You're in New York.
I'm in New York riding subways 14 hours a day, trying to find advertisers!
and how's it going so far?
what did you mean, "get left behind"?
Hi. Can I help you?
I'd like to freeze this bank account and cancel all existing checks and lines of credit.
may I see some ID, please? Yeah, sure, sorry.
Sean, he'll be right with you.
no problem.
you know this is where they filmed Towering Inferno?
that's comforting.
Hey, guys. Come on back.
she offer you some waters? Oh, yeah. We're cool.
Sean, how are you? Come on in.
you must be Mark. Hi.
we took a look at everything, and congratulations.
we're gonna start you off with a $500, 000 investment.
Maurice is gonna talk to you about some corporate restructuring.
we'll file as a corporation in Delaware and come up with a stock structure that allows for new investors.
now, let me ask you something.
who's Eduardo Saverin?
Jesus Christ.
when did you get back?
you scared me. I need you to knock.
when did you get back?
I got back this afternoon.
and when were you gonna call me?
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip and I was tired...
Yeah, or answer one of my 47 texts. Did you know I sent 47 texts?
I did, and I thought that was incredibly normal behavior.
are you mocking me?
I brought you a present.
why does your Status say "single" on your Facebook page?
what?
why does your Relationship Status say "single" on your Facebook page?
well, I was single when I set up the page.
and you just never bothered to change it?
what?
I don't know how.
do I look stupid to you?
no, calm down.
you're asking me to believe that the CFO of Facebook doesn't know how to change his Relationship Status on Facebook?
it's embarrassing, so you should take it as a sign of trust that I would tell you that.
go to hell. Take it easy.
no, you didn't change it so you could screw those Silicon Valley sluts every time you go out to see Mark.
not even remotely true, and I can promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts don't care what anyone's Relationship Status is on Facebook.
please, open your present.
your phone does work.
it's Mark.
okay, this is gonna be tricky.
open your present. It's a silk scarf.
have you ever seen me wear a scarf?
this'll be your first.
you froze our account? I did.
you froze the account. I had to get your attention, Mark.
do you realize that you jeopardized the entire company?
do you realize that your actions could have destroyed everything I've been working on?
we have been working on.
without money, the site can't function.
let me tell you the difference between Facebook and everybody else.
we don't crash ever!
if the servers are down for even a day, our entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed.
look... Users are fickle. Friendster has proved that.
even a few people leaving would reverberate through the entire user base.
the users are interconnected. That is the whole point.
college kids are online because their friends are online and if one domino goes, the other dominos go.
I am not going back to the Caribbean Night at AEPi!
holy shit.
what is wrong with you?
did you like being nobody?
did you like being a joke? Do you wanna go back to that?
hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
that was the act of a child, not a businessman, and it certainly was not the act of a friend.
you know how embarrassing it was for me to try to cash a check today?
I am not going back to that life.
maybe you were frustrated. Yeah!
maybe you were angry. I was!
but I am willing to let bygones be bygones, because, Wardo, I've got some good news.
I'm sorry.
I was angry, and maybe it was childish, but I had to get your attention.
Wardo, I said I've got some good news.
what is it?
Peter Thiel just made an angel investment of half a million dollars.
what?
half a million dollars. And he's setting us up in an office.
they wanna reincorporate the company. They wanna meet you.
they need your signature on some documents, so you gotta get your ass on the first flight back to San Francisco.
I need my CFO.
I'm on my way.
Wardo? Yeah?
we did it.
you're going back there already?
Yes.
and also, I'm breaking up with you.
somebody stop her!
four documents.
the first two are common stock purchase agreements, allowing you to buy stock in the newly reincorporated Facebook, as opposed to the old shares, which are now worthless.
the third is an exchange agreement allowing you to exchange the old shares for new shares, and then finally a voter holding agreement.
how many shares of stock will I own?
1328334
Jesus Christ.
that represents a 34. 4% ownership share.
why the increase from the original 30%?
cause you may need to dilute it to award shares to new investors.
I love working with business majors. I'm telling you.
economics. Right.
you should know that Mark has already taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.
well, Mark doesn't care about money and he needs to be protected.
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6. 81%.
Sean Parker, 6. 47%.
I can live with that.
and Peter Thiel, 7%.
would you like to use my pen?
can you please repeat the question?
no, it was an outrageously leading question the first time around, and now you want us to hear it twice?
Yes. Would you read it back, please?
well, go ahead.
and when you signed these documents, "'were you aware that you were signing your own death certificate?"'
no.
it was insanely stupid of me not to have my own lawyers look over all the...
in all honesty, I thought they were my lawyers.
I was your only friend.
you had one friend.
my father won't even look at me.
okay, Eduardo, did Mr. Zuckerberg say anything to you after you signed the papers?
there was a lot of handshaking, a lot of congratulations.
he'd already told me that he wouldn't be coming back to school for at least a semester, so we were saying goodbye for a while.
and then before I left he said...
but you gotta come back.
somewhere around the end of November or early December.
Peter wants to throw us an amazing party when we hit a million members.
it's gonna be out of control. You gotta come back for it.
a million members?
Yeah.
remember the algorithm on the window at Kirkland?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be here.
you sure about this?
you're 20 minutes late.
you're gonna walk in there and say you overslept and didn't have time to get dressed.
they're gonna pitch you. Case Equity is going to pitch you.
they're gonna beg you to take their money.
you're gonna nod, you're gonna nod, you're gonna nod, and then you're gonna say, "Which one of you is Roth?
no, not Roth. Manningham.
which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?" And he'll say, "I am.
and then you say, "Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you."'
walk out.
okay.
in late November, I got the email from Mark telling me to come out for the millionth member party.
what else did the email say?
it said that we had to have a business meeting.
that Mark and Sean had played some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity, and that Manningham was so impressed that he was now making an investment offer that was hard to turn down.
so I went to California, and I went straight to the new offices.
I didn't know whether to dress for the party or for the business meeting, so I kind of dressed for both.
but it didn't matter. Why not?
because I wasn't called out there for either one.
what were you called out there for?
an ambush.
Mr. Saverin. Hey. Right over here.
Hey, man.
how are you? Good. How are you?
good, good, good, good, good. Good to see you.
at first I thought he was joking. Giving me more contracts to sign.
but then I started reading.
wait, what is this?
well, as you know, we had some new investors that have come in.
what is this?
Mr. Saverin.
mark? He's wired in.
sorry? He's wired in.
is he? Yes.
how about now? Are you still wired in? Call security.
you issued 24 million new shares of stock!
you were told that if new investors came along...
how much were your shares diluted? How much were his?
what was Mr. Zuckerberg's ownership share diluted down to?
it wasn't.
what was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership share diluted down to?
it wasn't.
what was Sean Parker's ownership share diluted down to?
it wasn't.
what was Peter Thiel's ownership share diluted down to?
it wasn't.
and what was your ownership share diluted down to?
you signed the papers. You set me up.
you're gonna blame me because you were the business head of the company, and you made a bad business deal with your own company?
it's gonna be like I'm not a part of Facebook.
it won't be like you're not a part of Facebook.
you're not a part of Facebook.
my name's on the masthead. You might wanna check again.
this because I froze the account?
you think we'd let you parade around in your ridiculous suits, pretending you were running this company?
sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's!
along with my hoodie and my fuck you flipflops, you pretentious douchebag!
security's here. You'll be leaving now.
I'm not signing those papers. We will get the signature.
tell me this isn't about me getting into the Phoenix.
you... You did it. I knew you did it. You planted that story about the chicken!
I didn't plant that story. What's he talking about?
you had me accused of animal cruelty. Seriously. What the hell's the chicken?
and I'll bet what you hated the most is that they identified me as a cofounder of Facebook.
which I am. You better lawyer up, asshole.
cause I'm not coming back for 30%. I'm coming back for everything.
get him out of here. It's okay, I'm going.
hang on.
almost forgot.
here's your $19, 000. I wouldn't cash it, though.
I drew it on the account you froze.
I like standing next to you, Sean.
it makes me look so tough.
well...
that's it, that's our show for tonight, people.
and look, I wanna see everyone here geared up for a party.
we're gonna walk into that club like it's the Macy's Parade.
mackey, put it up on the big screen. We've gotta almost be there.
you all right? Yeah.
you were kind of rough on him.
that's life in the NFL.
you know you didn't have to be that rough on him.
you didn't have to be that rough on him.
he almost killed it.
I'll send flowers.
speaking of flowers, I'm putting together a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.
Ashleigh's a sister.
Ashleigh? The intern.
Yeah. I know who she is. Are you guys...
Ashleigh? Me? No.
well, a little bit.
Why?
no. Nothing, I just... Excuse me. Mark?
we were just talking about you. Just that you're doing a really good job.
Thanks. I appreciate that.
these came in for you.
put them on my desk.
what's the package?
nothing.
Mackey. Yes, sir.
refresh.
sweet!
and you're not a hugger.
one million!
who's got champagne? Huh?
I've got champagne.
the next transformative development, a picturesharing application.
a place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life.
it is the true digitalization of real life.
you can use a CD. You can do it off of me.
you don't just go to a party anymore.
you go to a party with a digital camera, and then your friends relive the party online.
and tagging. The idea...
would this be easier without the bra? It's worth finding out.
all right, shut the music down!
the party's over!
everybody, go home!
I've spent hours watching what people do when they log on.
how they check their friends' status updates.
wait. That's weird. Why did the music stop?
check to see which one of their friends changed their profiles, changed their photos...
seriously, what happened to the music?
we lived on farms and then we lived in cities, and now we're going to live on the Internet!
Sean, stop. I think something's going on downstairs.
ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?
it's time for you to go home. The party is over.
then it's all good.
it's the cops. What?
shit! Shit.
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Okay, it's okay. Be cool.
good to see you, Officer. What can I do for you?
what's going on?
was the music too loud? We were having a celebration.
miss, I need you to button your blouse.
I can tell them to turn the music down.
that's not mine.
okay, we're gonna need identification. Keep your hands where we can see them.
Oh, my God.
you got anything else in your pockets I should know about?
no, sir. No.
don't be stupid, now. I don't, I don't.
what's this?
that's an EpiPen.
and this? That's my inhaler.
how old are you?
Twentyone.
Twentyone. I'm 21.
lying only makes it worse.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.
hello.
listen, something's happened.
shit.
no, it's all right. It's gonna be all right.
I posted bond, and I wasn't doing anything. I mean, I've got allergies.
interns.
it was just a party.
this is gonna be news, Sean. It's gonna be online any second.
I know.
you know with an intern...
no, it's cool. I have it under control.
I will get it under control.
I will call someone and see what the next move is.
but this is gonna be news now.
you don't think Wardo was involved, do you?
I mean, do you think...
no.
or Manningham. One of them.
somebody. Somebody sent the coke in there, because it got in there.
you believe me. God, this is gonna be fine.
right?
go home, Sean.
we're done for the day.
Yeah. Yeah, I was just sitting here.
what happened to Sean?
he still owns 7% of the company.
all you had all day was that salad. Do you wanna get something to eat?
I can't.
I'm not a bad guy.
I know that.
when there's emotional testimony, I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.
and the other 15?
perjury. Creation myths need a devil.
what happens now?
sy and the others are having a steak on University Avenue.
then they'll come back up to the office, and start working on a settlement agreement to present to you.
they're gonna settle? Oh, yeah.
and you're gonna have to pay a little extra. Why?
so that these guys sign a nondisclosure agreement.
they say one unflattering word about you in public, you own their wife and kids.
I invented Facebook.
I'm talking about a jury.
I specialize in voir dire, jury selection.
what a jury sees when they look at a defendant.
clothes, hair, speaking style, likeability...
likeability.
I've been licensed to practice law for all of 20 months, and I could get a jury to believe that you planted the story about Eduardo and the chicken.
watch what else.
why weren't you at Sean's sorority party that night?
you think I'm the one that called the police? Doesn't matter.
I asked the question, now everybody's thinking about it.
you've lost your jury in the first 10 minutes.
farm animals.
Yeah.
I was drunk and angry and stupid.
and blogging. And blogging.
pay them.
in the scheme of things, it's a speeding ticket.
that's what Sy will tell you tomorrow.
do you think anybody would mind if I stayed and used the computer for a minute?
I can't imagine it would be a problem.
Thanks.
I appreciate your help today.
you're not an asshole, Mark.
you're just trying so hard to be.
mom and me versus You and Dad.
long. -That looked pretty good.
lt was out. -lt did look good.
Frank, it was out. -lt's my call. Out.
if you can, try and hit it at your mother's backhand.
lt's pretty weak. -Got it.
Yes! -Don't gloat, Walt.
five to three, we're in the lead.
fuck! Come on, Bernard. -Bernard, don't curse.
l'm cursing at myself.
nice shot. -Thanks.
Walt, watch out. -lt's part of the game.
Fifteen-love.
Joan, l'm sorry. lt was an accident.
you gotta get a second serve.
Frank.
did you just put that peanut up your nose?
no, it's Cashew.
pickle, that is such an idiotic, stupid thing to do.
no, it's out. l got it.
we're reading A Tale of Two Cities in English. ls that any good?
lt's minor Dickens. Popular in schools.
but l think David Copperfield or Great Expectations is much richer.
what is it about high school that you read all the worst books by good writers?
you should read it and see what you think of it.
l don't wanna waste my time.
what are you doing?
just fixing up the couch.
did you sleep there? -Yeah, our bed is hurting my back.
lsn't the couch worse than the bed? For backs?
no. This is better.
when does Mom's story come out in the magazine?
lt's not a magazine. lt's a literary journal.
next month, l think.
lt'll be weird having two writers as parents.
Yeah, well, dad influenced her. She never wrote before she met him.
l haven't read any of dad's books.
l've looked at them. They're great. Very dense.
he needs a new agent. lt's been too long.
the publishing world isn't receptive always to real literary talent.
maybe Mom will be famous instead.
no, Dad's the writer. -Maybe Mom's better.
that's way off base, Frank. That's way off base.
lvan hit with Arthur Ashe once.
wasn't he ranked, like, 402 or something?
lvan could've been a champ if he hadn't hurt his knee.
okay, my brother, let's see some groundstrokes.
you gotta ease up, my brother.
Jimmy Connors hits as hard as he can...
...but we can't all get away with that, right?
all right, let's see the backhand.
two hands. Two hands. Hey, my brother.
who taught you these junkyard strokes?
my Dad. He's self-taught.
l heard that. Hey, Bernard.
you teaching my brother here these junkyard chip shots?
a one-handed backhand is an elegant stroke.
my brother here doesn't want a weak chip shot for a backhand.
l don't care. -lt's McEnroe's stroke.
he's the master of the chip game.
all right, fellas, that's it for today. -lvan, you wanna hit a little?
l got a few minutes.
Frank, you and Carl hang out. Give me your racquet.
are you interested in any arts? -l wouldn't mind being a pro.
lt's very hard to be a professional player.
as good as even lvan is, he's not in a league with McEnroe or Connors.
Oh, l don't mean a pro like that.
l mean, like a pro at the bubble. Like lvan.
you don't wanna be a pro.
l'm sure l've lost my parking space. We're gonna have to drive around.
can you drop me off? -No.
l picked you up, the least you can do is ride around with me.
terrific, honeys.
Walt, did you write that song? -Yes.
Frank had some good ideas too. -Very dense. Very interesting.
Yeah. l signed up for the talent thing they have at school.
great. Just make sure you practice a lot.
mom, l'll be fine.
remember, you'll be in front of a lot of people.
don't ruin the whole thing for me. -You'll win.
lf you don't, something's wrong with them.
which is probably the case, actually. People can be very stupid.
l'll get it.
Walt, you wanna come to my class tomorrow after school?
Yeah. - Could l come?
you have tennis. You're gonna be doing that, which is its own thing.
look how young Dad looks. -That's funny. Dad, can l have this?
okay. -Would you write something in it?
Thanks.
'l absorb sex indiscriminately, numb and impartial.
l suck men of their interiors.
a fuck that unites John, Dan, Scott, whomever...
...in the popular lust and paternal hunt for my possession.
he was a large man, though his arms were thin.
the upper part soft, but not fleshy. Like a young woman's.
he had long, delicate fingers and plump palms similar to a raccoon's.
with finesse, he plied the meat from a crab claw...
...and sucked oysters from their shells. "
she's a very risky writer, Lili. Very racy.
l mean, exhibiting her cunt in that fashion is very racy.
Lili has her influences in postmodern literature, a bit derivative of Kafka.
but for a student, very racy.
did you get that it was her cunt? -Oh, yeah.
did you like it? -Yeah. A lot.
you'd like Kafka, one of my predecessors.
particularly The Metamorphosis. -Metamorphosis?
no fucking spaces.
l'll keep you company while we look. -Thank you.
dad, what were your wives like before Mom?
"wife, " really. The first one was annulled.
l was 1 9. -What was she like?
the annulled one? -No, the one you'd call a wife.
difficult.
that's Mom.
Yeah, that's Mom.
what was she wearing?
no, l guess l've seen that before.
what are you writing?
l'm working on the Peugeot story.
did you take my note about the ending?
some of it. -Does he still die?
Yeah. -Then you didn't take my note.
boys, make sure you come home right after school.
Why? -We're having a family conference.
what's that? -A talk. Just come home.
what about? -We'll go over it tonight.
can't you give us a hint? -No, just-- Tonight.
we'll go-- Everything-- We'll go over it tonight.
just waiting for your mother.
mom. -Sorry.
okay. -Okay. All set?
Yes.
okay.
your mom and l...
okay, yeah. Mom and l are going...
we're going to separate.
you're not gonna be leaving either of us.
we're gonna have joint custody. Frank, it's okay.
l've got an elegant new house across the park.
across the park?
ls that even Brooklyn? -lt's only five stops on the subway.
lt's an elegant block. The fillet of the neighborhood.
we'll have a Ping-Pong table. -l don't play Ping-Pong.
we'll both see you equally. -How?
we're splitting up the week. -Why?
l love you. l wanna see you as much as your mom does.
but there's seven days. -Right.
how will you split evenly with seven days?
l've got you Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday and every other Thursday.
every other? -That's how we each have you equally.
that was your father's idea.
don't do this. -How will we get to school?
there's a subway four blocks from the house.
four or five. No more than six blocks.
and what about the cat?
shit, the cat. -We didn't discuss the cat.
your father will pick him up on those days when you switch houses.
l'll drive here two more times a week?
you got a place on the other side of the park.
lf it was near here, it wouldn't be a problem.
this neighborhood got expensive. lt's painful for me to stay in this neighborhood. Don't be difficult. l feel banished.
Oh, Pickle.
dad, what will happen with the cat? -We'll figure something out.
ls it because Dad isn't as successful as he used to be?
now that you're publishing and he isn't, is that it?
that's not nice to say. -This is a great family.
why are you screwing it up?
lf we could avoid it, l would. -Why now?
you've been together 1 6 years. -Seventeen.
l can't imagine living like this.
don't most of your friends already have divorced parents?
Yeah, but l don't.
well, now you do.
l think you're doing a foolish thing. -l understand how unhappy you are.
l'm unhappy too. And l don't want you or Frank to blame yourself for any of this.
lt has nothing to do with you.
lt's okay. Go back to sleep.
are those your books? -Yes. These are my books.
why are they going under my bed?
because l bought them, and l don't wanna lose them.
we'll put them back on the shelf when your father leaves.
until things are certain, we shouldn't say anything to anyone yet.
Why? -Because we never know.
and l don't want people to know our business.
l told Carl.
already? -l called him last night.
l also told Matt and Dale.
and Dale? Shit, now everyone will know. Jesus, Frank.
mom says we should tell people. -Mom doesn't go to school.
stop crying.
joint custody blows. -l was told it's better.
lt's miserable. My parents didn't wanna uproot me and Rebecca.
so we stayed in the house. They took separate apartments, and switched off coming to us. Then my mom met Dexter.
my dad freaked out.
and then they sold the house, and l go back and forth anyway.
God, joint custody blows.
Thanks. Yeah, l forgot to take these. She has a few of my books still.
she wrote her maiden name in them when she knew we were splitting.
but these were mine.
are you and Walt stealing from Mom? -These were mine, Frank.
watch it! Jesus!
Hey, brother. Walt.
Bernard, Joan says you have a check for me.
she said that? No, tennis is hers.
our separation agreement says she handles tennis and winter coats.
l do sneakers and camp. -Okay. l'll take it up with her.
Walt.
lvan's a bit of a half-wit, isn't he?
lt was important to me to have a place like your mother's.
l'm gonna cook and run the household like you're used to.
this is nothing like our house. -You mean, your mother's house.
what? -This isn't like your mother's house.
that's what l said. -You said, " Our house. "
that's your mother's house. This is your house too.
no, this is your house. -lt's our house.
l hate Nastase. You know that. lvan met Nastase and said he was an asshole.
well, l couldn't find Vitas Gerulaitis. -l have a Vitas poster at home.
at Mom's. And all my turtles.
we can get some turtles. l know you like amphibians.
turtles are reptiles.
here's a desk for you to do your homework.
dad, this is for a lefty.
dad got me a lefty desk.
don't be difficult. We need to be supportive of Dad.
l hate it here. -Don't be a chick.
you can get a righty desk later. -Why do l want a desk at home?
l don't want a chalkboard or a bell going off every 45 minutes either.
he likes being with us. -He likes having us in the house.
you got books. l didn't get books.
because these are the books Dad knows l like.
l wanna go back to Mom's. -Why? She caused this, chick.
l'm not " chick. " -Yes, you are.
chick, this is Mom's doing. -Stop calling me chick!
mom told us they'd never get divorced. So Mom's a liar.
fuck! That hurt!
l'm not being a chick, you fucking ass man.
you're hurting me, really hurting me.
one turtle would've made a difference.
you live in Park Slope, right?
my mom does. And l do sometimes.
l live on the other side of the park half the time.
prospect Heights? -l'm not sure.
the street's Stratford Road. My dad's moving there.
l hear it's the fillet of the neighborhood.
you like Franz Kafka? -l don't know him.
he's great. The Metamorphosis is a masterpiece.
sounds good. -Yeah, it is.
have you read This Side of Paradise? -No, but it's minor Fitzgerald.
ls it? l loved it. -lt's a minor work.
gatsby is his masterpiece. And Tender is the Night is dazzling.
last Tycoon, had he finished it...
l hope you like it. Your notes were awesome, Bernard.
l loved your idea for the change in tense at the end.
lt could be the coup of the story.
l reread A Hunger Artist on your suggestion and stole a couple things.
see if you can spot them. -Good story to steal from.
fuck! -Frank.
sorry.
how long were you and Mom not getting along?
a couple of years. l thought we would work it out.
l wanted to. l tried. As you know, l tried very hard.
your mother wasn't interested in that. -Why not?
l think it has very little to do with me. -Shit! Fucker!
Frank! -She could never make up her mind.
she'd pull away and then get angry at me for not being more aggressive.
her affair with Richard made it difficult for me to save the marriage. lt became a fait accompli.
affair? -With Richard.
who's Richard? -A man from the neighborhood.
l think she met him at one of Frank's Little League games. A shrink.
seems sort of like an ordinary guy. Not an intellectual.
how long was she having the affair? -About four years.
you're kidding. -No. l thought you knew this.
no. No.
fuck that cock shit!
Frank, you gotta relax, my brother.
Hey, Mom. -Hey, honeys.
what are you doing? -Just changing things around a bit.
l've come by to tell you l'm not staying here anymore.
Why? -You know why.
l don't. -Frank, do you know why?
no. -Why don't you tell me?
because you cheated on Dad.
how did you hear that?
your father told you. -Yeah, he told me.
why did you, Mom?
l was having a hard time.
where were we during this? Did you bring men home?
not while-- Not...
not when your father was in town.
you actually met Richard, both you boys.
he came over for takeout once.
you talked about the Stones.
Oh, God. Under our noses. Like a brothel. Men coming in and out.
shut up. -lf you want me to explain, l will.
l don't wanna hear it. -l do.
Walt doesn't, so l won't say anything.
Walt can leave. -You disgust me.
you weren't even a writer until recently.
you bailed on Dad because he's not successful and hasn't got recognition.
you sound like your father. -l'm glad. You disgust me.
you're being a shit, Walt.
l'm taking the cat. -You can't have him. lt's his night here.
okay, you can kiss me now.
no, the moment's ruined.
l'll go sneak up and surprise Chrissy. -lt's not her birthday.
she also had an affair with some therapist.
l don't wanna know. -And Otto's father, Don.
Otto's father? -Yeah, but it's over.
she said the affairs have been miserable for her.
she's dating now, but nothing serious.
she's crazy. She should keep her affairs to herself.
l'm not going back. -You have to, joint custody.
fuck joint custody.
ls Mom letting you drink soda? -Beer.
since when do you drink beer? -Since recently.
you think Don and she did it?
l don't wanna think about it. -lmagine Don's dick in Mom's mouth.
who are you? Stop it. -Do you think they do that?
you think she gets anal sex from Don? -Stop, okay.
lt's disgusting.
don't.
we have the same bone structure. -No.
you have your dad's features.
Really?
fuck it. -Frank.
l thought l had your bone structure. -No.
you're ugly.
pickle, why would you say that?
because l think it's true. l think Carl thinks you're ugly.
l'm not though, sweetie.
l found out something last night. -What's that?
that your dad was fucking my mom.
what? -You heard me.
supposedly going on for a year or so about two years ago.
l'm so horrified by this. -Thanks.
no, l don't mean by your mom. She's very attractive.
lt was just an affair. A fuck. We're not gonna be brothers.
she said your dad's pretty fucked up with women.
why'd she sleep with him then?
l don't know.
because she's an asshole.
l read The Metamorphosis. You were right, it's great.
Yeah. So bizarre. What do you think is happening at the end, with the sister?
Yeah, l think she's...
l mean, it's ambiguous, really. -Yeah.
l mean, it's gross when he turns into a bug...
...but l love how matter-of-fact everything is.
Yeah, it's very Kafkaesque.
because it's written by Franz Kafka. -Right.
no, l mean, clearly. -lt would have to be.
you're shoving the whole tongue in me.
no, it's okay. Just do it a little-- Like, little licks.
like this? -Yeah.
l wish you didn't have so many freckles on your face.
not really, though.
l'm feeling kind of feverish.
do we have any Tylenol? -l don't know.
l didn't see any. -Then there isn't any.
can we get some?
ls this enough? -Get a small one.
l don't have enough money. -Okay.
l got it. -You have any change?
wanna play Ping-Pong?
l'm gonna lie down. -One game.
fucking shit. -Nineteen-7.
have you given more thought to what you're interested in?
come on.
you have to try. lt's no fun for me if you don't try.
l wanna be a tennis pro like lvan. -You don't wanna be a tennis pro.
why not? -lt's not serious.
l mean, McEnroe. Borg is an artist. lt's like dance.
Connors has a brilliance. But at lvan's level...
lvan is fine, but he's not a serious guy.
he's a philistine. -What's a philistine?
lt's a guy who doesn't care about books or interesting films and things.
your mother's brother Ned is also a philistine.
then l'm a philistine. -No.
you're interested in books and things. Liked The Wild Child when we saw it.
lots of people liked that movie.
no, l'm a philistine.
when am l going to meet the famous Sophie?
l don't know. She's not gorgeous, but she's cute.
you have plenty of time to sleep with gorgeous women.
goddamn it!
they fell on the floor.
when my first novel came out, l had a lot of opportunities.
l was with your mother, so l didn't partake.
l've never had an affair with a student, though many have come on to me.
that's why you might not wanna be attached at your age.
lt sounds like Sophie's good for now.
why'd you yell, " Goddamn it " ? -l burned myself.
the cutlets are great. Dad, did you hear from that agent?
not yet. -But if he likes your novel...
...then you get it published. -Basically.
what happened to your old agent, Fred?
he pissed me off.
made a disparaging remark about the Knicks at a party.
said they played like thugs. l found it offensive.
he's kind of a jerk.
lt was important to your mother that l achieve some sort of commercial success.
and when l didn't meet her expectations in that area...
you're going to witness a Greenberg family tradition.
friday night Chinese at Hunan Palace. l hope you're prepared.
Hey. -Hey.
why'd you let go of my hand?
what? -When we passed Wendy, you let go.
l didn't realize.
Walt, anything you'd like to order?
l'm happy to have the same amount of dishes as people.
lt's always one dish less the number of people.
that's our family tradition, not ordering enough food.
that's funny. Oh, he's funny, Sophie. -l know.
you're early. -Hi, Joan.
don't feed him the generic stuff. -What?
Frank says you're feeding the cat generic food.
get Purina, it's what he likes.
lt's the same damn thing. -lt's not, but
he's my cat too.
remember when he got stuck in a wall in New Hampshire and l rescued him?
l know how to handle him. -lt was a radiator.
what? -He got stuck in a radiator.
you trimmed your beard.
Yeah, it was starting to get a little feral.
you look well. -Yeah?
Thanks. -Things are good here.
teaching is going well.
and l'm playing the best tennis of my life.
maybe that's an illusion...
...but it feels that way.
that's good.
l was thinking we should sit together at Walt's performance next month.
okay. -lt'd be nice for him...
...if we're both there together.
maybe we could all go out afterwards.
l don't know. Maybe.
okay, maybe.
l think he's getting good at guitar.
l know.
the stuff he's writing is really wonderful.
have you met his girlfriend? -No. He talks about her with me, though. -Good.
l'd appreciate it if you didn't tell him about things like Richard.
my father told me you called him.
l did, yeah.
he said you...
he said you were upset. -Yeah.
l wanted to...
l like him.
you know that.
l just wanted to say-- l don't know.
l just wanted to say hello.
he called me right after. He said:
"Bernie, l think you can save your marriage. "
l told him...
...l didn't think there was anything else l could do.
l did try everything.
Bye, Bernard.
Bernard?
l was wondering if you knew of any apartments.
l'm being kicked out of my sublet.
unless l, l don't know, blow the super, l'm out on my ass.
Oh, l don't. No.
l guess you don't know either, huh?
no.
l have an extra room in my house. You could stay till you find something.
you wouldn't have to blow your super.
l guess...
l'd hate to put you out. -No, no.
or your kids. -No. No.
the Mother and the Whore.
looks like a cool movie. -A classic.
l had it in my room. -Bathroom is across the hall.
you'll share with the kids. They can use mine.
l don't care. As long as Walt remembers to put the seat down.
thank you, Bernard. Thank you, Walt.
Joan says you don't like your sheets. -They're fine.
and you disapprove of the food l feed the cat.
you should tell me these things, not her.
fuck! -Fifteen.
Fifteen-20.
motherfucker! -My serve.
l wasn't ready. -Yes, you were.
Frank, l was not ready.
this is Mother Hubbard. There is nothing to eat or drink. No soda.
we're not allowed soda. -Goddamn it!
l guess there's two kinds of parents:
those who allow soda and sugar cereal, and those who don't.
we're not supposed to use paper towels to wipe our hands. Cloth is for that.
you're cute.
Thanks.
l don't believe this shit.
shit! -Good game.
lt's hard to beat your father.
Hey!
watch it! -Suck my dick, ass man.
where you going? -The movies.
and then to a party with Sophie.
what are you gonna do? -l don't know.
Frank won't leave his room. He's being difficult.
you wanna come to the movie?
okay.
not the party, but the movie.
so we were thinking Short Circuit.
blue Velvet is supposed to be quite interesting.
l love you! Love me!
he put his disease in me.
tell me it's all right. l opened myself to you.
no.
stop, Frank.
no.
a student of mine writes very racy short stories you might like.
she has one that Chronicles Her Vagina.
dad. -That sounds interesting.
very feminist, but very interesting.
Frank, l'm back.
Frank?
Frank?
what were you doing? -l was going to Mom's.
you don't do that on my night. Ever. You hear me?
Yes. -l'm your father.
you listen to what l say.
but you were out. -lt's still my night, damn it.
okay, okay.
shit! Someone's taken my space.
goddamn it. Son of a bitch. -Sorry.
Frank!
Hello?
Hello?
Frank, what are you doing here? lt's not your night with me.
l don't wanna look like Dad. -Looks aren't everything.
lt's not your night with me, sweetie.
did you have a party? -l celebrated.
knopf is publishing my novel. Pickle, you should be at your dad's.
yeah? -Yeah.
l need some nights without you guys sometimes.
what's up, brother?
nothing.
Hello?
he just took off and went to your mother's. lt's my night, he knows that.
you think we could ease up on whose night is whose?
l wanna see you guys. l love you.
did you like Sophie?
Yeah. l think she's fine. ls she a Knicks fan?
l don't know.
you think she's pretty? -Sure, yeah.
but she's not the type l go for.
you just have to decide if you wanna be attached.
lt's good to play the field at your age.
Lili is pretty.
would you go ring the bell? l hate walking up those steps.
lt's very uncomfortable for me. Very painful.
l used to live in this house.
as you know.
your dad and Walt are here. They're gonna take you back to Bernard's.
l'll be right out. -l'm sorry about
l'm sorry about your seeing lvan like this.
l would've liked to have told you before you saw him.
your mother.
l wanted to talk about lvan so you don't hear it from anyone else.
Frank may have already said something.
Yeah, he did.
l've been seeing him a short time.
but l like him.
and l thought you guys should know that.
and do you have any questions? -No.
there was something else l was gonna say.
l ran into Celia, Lance's mother, on the street, and she was telling me how wonderful she thinks you are.
how polite and funny and...
she said you did something with the salt and pepper shakers.
a little play or something? -Yeah. lt was kind of stupid.
l said, " l already know all those things about him. But it's nice to hear it. "
l remember what else l was gonna say.
l wanted to know if you'd be interested in coming to dinner Saturday. l'm having the Dicksteins over.
no. l'm going to a party on Saturday. l'm sleeping at Jeffrey's.
that's okay. -l'm gonna go to bed.
okay. Good night, Chicken.
night.
you think she likes you? -l get a feeling, yeah.
what about Sophie? -lf l can lose it to Lili, l'll do it.
l mean, l bet she's great in bed.
she can probably move her pussy muscles the right way...
...so you blow your load in seconds. -Yeah. lt'd be pretty great.
maybe do them both. Why not?
Hey, brother.
how's the grip?
do you think you and l are philistines? -Frank.
what's a philistine?
someone who doesn't like books or interesting movies or things.
you're still here. lt's my night. -l know.
l just thought l'd watch him hit.
you married?
no.
the whole thing's very complicated.
mom's dating lvan.
Really?
lvan, back there lvan? -Yeah.
are you sure?
why didn't you say something?
why is your mother dating all these jocks?
very uninteresting men. -lvan is very interesting.
lvan's not a serious possibility for your mother.
l think he is.
l don't wanna badmouth lvan.
but l don't know what Joan is thinking.
l think lvan-- -Frank.
sorry. ls that too hard? -Yeah, a bit. A bit.
ls that better?
Yeah.
Yeah. That's good. That's
l guess...
l don't know what...
why that happened. -Oh, it's okay. Yeah.
lt's okay. -Okay.
shit. Sorry. -Don't be sorry.
l don't know why l didn't last. l usually go longer.
lt's okay. l guess l can take it as a compliment.
did you take your shirt off for Nelson Barton?
l don't wanna talk about it, Walt. -lt's important.
why is it important? -l need to know what happened.
well, he felt me up, and l touched him.
down his pants? -Walt, yeah.
l just...
from what l could tell, not an intellectual.
l'm a virgin.
so am l.
when's your next book coming out? -Soon, l hope. Soon.
who's publishing it? -Well, l'm looking for a new agent first.
a friend of mine's an agent with Binky Urban.
lf you like, l'll show it to him. -Oh, that'd be great.
Hello?
could l stay the night at Sophie's? -Thanks for doing that.
okay, l'll see you tomorrow.
or Tuesday. l'll see you Tuesday.
you don't need me home for anything? -No. Everything's fine.
lf you're interested, Walt and l are taking a road trip to SUNY Binghamton in a couple of weekends.
l'm giving a reading. And an ex-student of mine, now friend Jeb Gelber, is feting me with a dinner.
excellent.
you should read the cathedral scene from Underwater.
l've done that one a lot. l thought l'd do something new.
but okay, well, maybe.
sorry, my nose is running.
l'm your teacher.
l've wondered for a long time what it'd be like to fuck you.
l think we should wait.
Really?
Yeah. Yeah, let's wait.
okay, up next, Walt Berkman...
...who is going to play us a song.
thank you.
l'm going to play lead guitar and do vocals on a song l wrote.
that song was so good! -Thank you.
Oh, Dad, you remember Sophie.
and Lili. -Hi.
how much did you win? -Hundred bucks.
come by my room tonight before you go to bed.
l wanna show you something. -Okay.
and this is my mom and Frank and lvan.
Hi.
some song, brother. -Thanks.
Hey, Bernard.
l thought we'd have dinner.
lvan suggested Gage & Tollner. We'd celebrate my book and your song.
l'm gonna go with Dad. -Well, your dad and l talked about all of us going. -l don't wanna do that. See you.
lvan and l came to see your show. Don't treat us that way.
you think you hate me, but l know you don't.
Where'd you come up with those lyrics?
they were very dreamlike.
reminds me of my second novel, End of the Line.
a rock-star character in that. -l love that novel.
classic. Scenes with the baby in the middle are based on me as a baby.
right. lt's Mailer's favorite of my books.
and l loved your wife's piece in The New Yorker.
Really? ln The New Yorker?
did you know about this? -l guess l did.
how'd that happen? -lt's an excerpt.
she's getting a novel published. -Really?
Walt showed it to me. lt was kind of sad, but really good.
the portions are very big here. You only need half an order.
okay.
Jesus, $ 1 5 for parking.
what do you think l should do about Sophie?
you'll make the right decision.
l regret sometimes l wasn't more of a free agent when l was younger.
a woman approached me at a party at George Plimpton's after my first book.
she was very sexy. l could've gone home with her.
why didn't you?
l was with your mother. -Oh, right, of course.
you should've probably done it. lt didn't stop her.
maybe you should sleep with her once. See if you like it.
lt doesn't mean you can't see other women too.
l don't know if Sophie will go for that.
well, after your performance tonight, things might change for you.
wanna go to my house? We could-- -Jesus!
you really wanna do it, don't you? -l don't know.
what's the obsession with sex? -lt's not an obsession.
l'm not so sure l wanna do it either. l'm scared too.
scared is not the issue. Everything is so serious suddenly.
we're not getting married. -What are you saying?
nothing. l don't wanna feel this pressure.
do you like someone else? Your dad's girlfriend?
no. No. Why...?
no. And she's not his girlfriend.
my dad said you had a weak handshake, a sign of indecision.
his hands are huge, l can't get a good grip.
my mom said you don't have a good model for relationships because of your parents. -What?
your mother doesn't know anything.
l thought it went well. You told me she said l was hilarious.
don't be difficult. Please.
you want a beer?
l couldn't take relying on your dad's shopping habits anymore.
you can have anything you want whenever.
Thanks.
l'm gonna read you a draft of my new story.
l wanna hear your thoughts first. Then l'm gonna show it to your dad.
you like Pink Floyd, huh?
what? -Don't worry.
l used to hand in Lou Reed lyrics in my poetry class and pass them off as my own.
although l hope you don't get caught. l always did.
do you--?
fuck! -Sorry.
shit! -Lili, sorry.
lt's okay. lt's just a...
lt's just a bloody nose. -l'm sorry.
l might take a bath, okay? -Oh, okay.
okay. -Good night.
Hey. -Hey.
when's Bernard coming to get you? -ln an hour.
plan on 30 minutes. He's always early to get you.
and late to bring you back.
l wish l could come with you guys. -l heard that.
l know. But Dad's got you on Saturdays.
do you like his girlfriend? -ls she his girlfriend?
l thought so. She lives with you.
he doesn't say? -No.
l think Walt loves her.
so they like the same women now too. -What?
lt's nothing. You got our number in Maine. Remember to lock up.
l will.
see you next week, Pickle-oo. -Just Pickle, please.
l'll see you next week, just Pickle.
good grip, brother. -You too, brother.
dad, it's me.
are you there?
pick up.
how are you? -Good to see you.
'lt has been a long, emotionally draining day and night.
who is that boy?' someone in the pub asks.
l'm sorry about the turnout. Kids go home early for Passover.
they seemed to like it.
l mean, masturbating is his own issue.
but Hector witnessed the locker incident and then later, semen was found in the library.
who's Hector?
how do you know they were both Frank's?
well, l suppose it's possible other kids are masturbating...
...and spreading their semen around the school as well.
lt's possible, but somewhat unlikely.
Oh, it happens, l'm sure, more than we know.
Bernard, have you ever done anything like this?
l'm not going to answer that.
has anything been going on at home that might've provoked this behavior?
well, Bernard left him behind for three days last week.
of course, Frank's mother divorced me earlier this year.
which also might have something to do with it.
ms. Berkman, l read your story in The New Yorker.
l thought it was quite moving. -Thanks.
thanks a lot.
you're living with a 20-year-old.
lt's none of your business. -lt is when you have our kids.
lt's confusing for them.
Frank says Walt's in love with her.
Walt has a girlfriend.
fuck off, Joan.
l don't ask about you and lvan. Stay out of my life.
l can't believe you'd talk to me like this.
you left all those fucking ticket stubs and letters lying around.
you wanted me to know.
lt was fucking torture, Joan.
fucking torture.
he made his own interpretation.
he's still gonna have to give the prize money back.
but obviously it's a bigger problem. He isn't doing his schoolwork either.
his paper on Gatsby was quite brilliant, l thought.
lt's one of his favorite books.
that may be, but l don't believe he's read it.
you both should talk to him.
l think Bernard has to do it.
he wants you to see a therapist.
l don't need that. -That's what l said.
does Simic know both your parents have Ph. D.'s in literature?
l mentioned it. -l think he's full of shit.
these public schools tend to hire well-meaning but ultimately unsophisticated bureaucrats. -Yeah. l don't like him.
but you might have to do it. Just to please the school.
l don't need it. -l know.
and unfortunately, probably a guy with a BA in psychology.
not a real shrink.
l have an MA in developmental psychology from the Yale Child Studies program. -Did you get a Ph. D?
no, an MA is a Master's.
right.
any thoughts about why you're here? -Not really.
you said you wrote the song you played in assembly.
Why? -l don't know.
did you have a reason?
l felt l could've written it. -Okay.
but you didn't.
lt was written by Roger Waters of Pink Floyd.
l think you know that. -But l felt l could've.
so the fact that it was already written was kind of a technicality.
l see.
l can imagine this is a little uncomfortable for you to talk about.
l guess. lt's hard to explain. -l wonder how you're feeling right now.
l don't know.
why don't you tell me about something less uncomfortable.
like a nice memory, maybe.
lsn't that a stock question for a shrink?
Yes. That's more or less how this works.
l can't think of anything right now. -Just think.
come on. -Just something.
meet me halfway here.
all right, let's see.
okay.
when l was around 6, my Mom and l...
...ducked out of Julie Glynn's birthday party...
...to watch Robin Hood together on our TV.
that sounds like a nice memory.
l liked Errol Flynn. -Errol Flynn.
that's all? -And...
...l was glad she let me leave the party to watch the movie.
she and l loved that movie.
it's like we were pals then, and we'd do things together.
we'd look at the knight armor at the Met.
the scary fish at the Natural History museum.
l was always afraid of the squid and the whale fighting.
l could only look at it with my hands in front of my face.
when we'd get home, after my bath, she'd go through...
...all the different things we saw that day at the museum. And...
and we'd get to the squid and the whale, and she'd describe it for me.
which was-- lt was still scary...
...but it was less scary.
anyway, it was fun. lt was fun to hear about it.
did your dad live at home back then?
Yeah, why? -You didn't mention him.
where was he during all of this?
he was...
l don't know exactly. He was...
he was downstairs, maybe.
he didn't ever come to the museum. This was before my brother was born.
lt was before...
lt was earlier.
Hello?
Hello?
not now, Bernard. -Why not?
l'm just not, okay?
put me in your mouth. -Walt!
Hi. -Hey, Walt.
Hi.
l'll be right out. We can hang out.
Hi. ls Walt here? -No.
l'd like you to come to my house.
lsn't it Mom's night? -Yeah, but l'd like you to come over.
l have to put on my shoes.
come in, l guess.
place looks different. -She got some new furniture in Maine.
that was my TV. l bought that TV.
that's my Jude the Obscure.
wanna take it? -No.
she still has some of the books you wrote.
dad, why are you taking me to your house on Mom's night?
just a minute.
Hi.
Frank let me in. l didn't realize you were here.
l'm here. lt's Monday. -l'd like to take him for just tonight.
l'll give you two Thursdays in a row or something.
mom. -lt's my night. He wants to stay.
be careful. That's an antique.
Where's Walt? -l don't know where Walt is.
he's not up there. Bernard!
he doesn't come here.
you should go. You'll see him tomorrow.
tell Walt to call me.
l dunked my head in that pond in the park.
the one near the zoo? Oh, sweetie, that's filthy.
l hope you didn't drink any of it.
some may have gotten in my mouth. l tried not to swallow.
l shouldn't have broken up with Sophie.
why did you? -l thought l could do better.
better how?
l don't know.
that's good. You miss her.
but l don't see myself as a person who is in this situation. l just don't.
l don't see myself this way.
well, this is how it is.
did you ever love Dad?
because if you didn't, why did you ever marry him?
lf you were gonna leave, why put us through this?
lt wasn't planned. When we first met, he was unlike anyone.
ln Columbus, there was no one like your dad.
l had had an affair with a man before your father.
he worked at the bookstore. We made love in the stockroom.
mom, l don't wanna hear about your affairs, please.
l'm sorry.
l don't know what l can say to you.
you say things in a way that l don't wanna hear them.
l know, Chicken.
lt's something l do. lt's a bad habit.
do you remember when we watched Robin Hood?
he knocked on my window. -Bernard, what are you doing?
Joan, let me ask you something.
the work l did at the end of our marriage...
...making dinners, being attentive. lt never was gonna make a difference.
you were leaving. -You never made a dinner.
l made burgers when you had pneumonia.
only after l insisted. -lf l had made more dinners...
...would that have made a difference? -l was ready to leave long ago.
l just didn't know it then.
l've been giving it some thought. You called my father at the last minute.
whatever you said, he thought l could save the marriage.
you felt l wasn't aggressive enough. l'll make more of an effort to do stuff.
l've been cooking and doing chores at my house.
l make veal cutlets, which the boys love.
why don't we all have dinner and talk more about this?
l'm sorry.
lt's just Burgers.
l'll sue you, Joan. You know l will.
you had an affair for four years with that fucking shrink...
...that ruined our marriage. l can get the kids.
Eddie Goodman works on these cases. And l have an open-and-shut case.
Frank, Walt, get in the car. -Sue me?
that's-- l can't
you only wanted joint custody because you pay less child support that way.
because it's cheaper for you.
Walt, Frank!
l don't wanna go. -l don't give a shit! Get in the car.
Frank! -Let him stay. Let him stay.
l'm just asking this one thing. -He wants to stay.
let him. l'll go. -Fine.
hold on.
you want him tonight?
okay. Thanks.
that's all right, my brother.
the cat!
l got him. Joan, l got him.
l got him.
goddamn it.
dad! You see him go--? -l'm moving it!
fuck off.
whoa, Bernard! You all right?
l had him. -Joan, call an ambulance!
Walt, get in the car.
what?
lt means " bitch. " Don't you remember?
you're calling me a bitch?
no, don't you remember the last line of Godard's A bout de souffle?
Belmondo calls Seberg a bitch.
we saw it at the Thalia with the Dicksteins.
l got you in for the children's price. You were pregnant with Walt.
like six weeks.
l still got you in for a children's ticket.
you told me you didn't like Godard. You thought the jump cuts were
l'd check for the cat behind the ashcans...
... under the Golodners' stoop! -Okay.
l didn't write it.
l know. -Pink Floyd did.
do you think we'll find him?
l hope so.
l don't know, Pickle.
lvan and l could take you to the country on Saturday to see real turtles.
Saturday is Dad's day.
there's my son. -Hey.
are you okay? -l'm fine.
thought it was a heart attack, but l think l'm just exhausted.
doctor said l'm exhausted.
too many veal cutlets? -Maybe.
that a good book?
Oh, this is pulp. lt's not serious.
lt's hard to read a good book in the hospital, but this isn't bad of its kind.
Leonard is the fillet of the crime genre.
l'd like you to stay here for the day. l need the company.
okay.
Lili moved out.
do me a favor, go out in the hall, get me another pillow.
my neck is hurting.
maybe we could even things out, and l could stay at Mom's a few nights.
l've been staying more at yours. -lt's not a good time.
l'm not gonna be 1 00 percent for a while. l'd like you around.
l don't wanna come for a while. -lt's not up to you.
you're a minor. You're in my custody. My home is your home too.
l'm not coming.
Why?
that hurts my feelings.
don't be difficult.
lf you like, we can get you some more posters, make your room better.
paint it a different color.
l can lend you my first edition of The Naked and the Dead.
as a present.
let me get you a pillow.
you used to be very emotional when you were younger.
did l look pretty silly out there, falling on the concrete?
Yeah.
what? What are you laughing at?
that was funny how you said, " Yeah. "
good comic timing. -Thanks.
why don't we get some breakfast.
see if you can find a nurse out there.
try to get the blond. She looks like a young Monica Vitti.
Oh, excuse me.
the man in that room wants to order some breakfast.
okay.
okay, you've got to make a wish.
but I married you to take care of us.
okay, everybody ready for cake?
your family is doing well in protective custody.
did you do it?
yay, okay. Everyone sing Happy...
don't you understand? You help me you help yourself.
I love it, Daddy.
so you're saying you can't or you won't intervene in Salt Lake City?
look, Mason, you're not my superior. I don't take my orders from you.
I asked you nicely.
so what is there in Salt Lake City that scares you?
the Jazz?
look, it's none of our business.
it's Bureau business and it started in our jurisdiction.
all right, if you really think our presence there will make the difference,
I'll contact them and get a copy of the report.
but for the record, you're still not my boss.
yet.
he's back.
then the red cart, that would represent her childhood.
so as you can see, random objects can in themselves trigger profound reversal of some forms of retrograde amnesia, which in many cases can result in a recaptured memory.
excuse me.
was it really him? - I'm fine. And you?
I'm sorry. It's good to see you.
you know, it might have been him. I showed his photo to Seattle SWAT.
And? - Well, they saw a resemblance.
but this guy, he was a dirty down-and-outer.
besides, they only got a brief glimpse of him before he ran.
why did he run? - He killed a guy.
it actually was in the act of saving a little girl's life.
that sounds more like him.
the local PD was running a ransom exchange.
a local lawyer recorded some incriminating conversations with the son of a big mob boss.
kid got spooked, kidnapped the lawyer's daughter.
I guess our guy was in the right place at the right time.
was it really him? - Give me back my baby.
I gave you what you wanted. Now let her go.
maybe I should just keep her.
she is a pretty little thing.
for God's sake help me, please.
please help me.
you just killed her.
say goodbye to your little...
they tried to kill him for his efforts.
this is it.
God knows how he is, but he got away.
now we're not the only ones looking for him.
let them join the club. See if they have any better luck.
they think he's been here for about six months, but they couldn't make a positive ID without prints.
you can't leave prints when you don't have any.
Mason.
it's another digit.
he's starting to remember.
so what do we do now?
same thing we always do... we wait.
what are you gonna do with that?
if we see him again, it could be a key to unlock some of his buried memories.
I want to thank you for sticking through all this.
he is my patient.
I need to see this through.
and you don't miss me at all?
it was one night.
I think we should leave it at that.
so he got away again?
Yes, sir.
and the last time we had any contact with him was?
10 months ago. Tucson. No collateral.
but there's been more than enough collateral on this case, hasn't there, Agent Reese?
but he's potentially a major source of embarrassment for us, sir.
not as embarrassing as an over budgeted case with no results.
look, somewhere in that screwed-up head of his he knows who the mole who's been tipping off the Russian mob is.
don't we want to be ahead of that?
sure. But we haven't been so far, have we?
let it go.
even in these alternate states, the clues to the true self can always be found in the metaphor that the mind is playing out.
if we look at each piece of the larger puzzle then we can discover...
we can discover that they fit together to tell the story.
but putting the puzzle together, now that's something that only the patient can do and only when they're ready.
that's it for today, class. Paper is due tomorrow.
thank you.
what are you doing here?
has something come up with the extension of the numbers?
no.
I mean, I don't know.
look, Grace, there's no way to sugar-coat this.
they've killed the case.
what? You can't do this.
it's not up to me.
but I don't understand.
it's Chief Pickar.
he's wanted to shut this down ever since our guy went rogue.
he's not rogue. He's sick.
he needs help.
it's out of my hands.
so that's it?
you just forget about it? Act like he never existed?
he has.
grace, I can't go against orders.
well, maybe you can't.
but...
but if I can find him...
I can help him.
it's not a good idea.
look, you work for the FBI, not me.
now for this first interview
I'm just gonna ask you a few simple questions, okay?
I'm not crazy.
is that what you think? That I think you're crazy?
well, you did say you found me covered in blood trying to break into the Seattle shipping docks.
well, yes, there was that.
so if I'm not crazy, then what am I?
the mind is an amazing thing.
when things become too much for us to bear, it can protect us without us even knowing.
I believe you saw and or experienced some kind of trauma that initially triggered this state.
amigos.
gracias.
make sure the gringo is dead.
Vamos.
is it someone that you know?
fuck.
big bad ass, this one.
I keep telling you.
I don't know who they are.
maybe you don't, amigo.
but you know where you were taking them.
I am going to show you...
I am going to show you what we do to cop killers in this country.
is it a child that you're drawing?
don't do it.
Hello?
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
I don't know who I'm calling here.
it's the only number I can remember.
where are you?
I'm sorry for bothering you.
Oh no, you're not bothering me. Please don't hang up.
I'm a friend.
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
Hey!
Yeah, I called the number back.
it's a gas station just north of the California-Oregon border.
slow down. Are you sure it was him?
definitely. He may be retracing his steps.
look, he sounded very disoriented.
I'm looking at some pretty gruesome photos of an all-out slaughter - at the Tijuana Police Department. - And?
and they were interrogating a coyote that fits his description when he went ballistic and took down the whole police force.
and you think that it's him?
or whoever he thinks he is these days.
look, just the fact that he called means he's remembering.
it's a cry for help.
Mason, we have to do something.
we've been warned to leave it alone.
no.
you've been warned.
he remembered her number.
I guess that's progress.
good. Then what are we doing here?
she wants to try and track him down.
but if we go against orders it'll just draw suspicion.
what's going on?
they're in my computer.
so what did you find out about my computer problem?
I don't think you want to know. I don't think I want to know.
I'm a big boy. I can handle it.
all right, okay. Look, nobody can access our system from the outside. Nobody.
so it is from inside the Bureau. - Yeah, but here's the thing.
only two people have the access code to get into the individual files.
and I'm one of them. - And the other is?
who do you think? Pickar.
I figured.
don't sweat it. It's not like he was checking up on you personally.
you're cool. - What do you mean?
you know what he's searching for? - Yeah. Dude, she's hot.
who is that?
what, dude?
I think it's a mistake. - We'll be okay.
is it a child that you're drawing?
they killed a man.
you okay there?
Hey, pal, can I help you with something? You look a little lost.
believe it or not, my grandmother was from Moscow.
I could really use the work.
Katya.
Dedulya, where have you been?
I've been shopping. Here, put this in the galley.
and don't eat all the chocolate.
Dedulya.
so you ever work a boat before?
Oh yeah, all my life. East Coast, lobstering.
huh. Well, here we are salmon, sablefish, some swordfish, occasional squid.
I can handle nets if that's what you're fishing for.
Mikhail. Welcome aboard, Jake.
you can hand me the first there.
thank you.
excuse me. Hi. - Hi.
have you seen this guy?
Yup.
headed to Coos Bay.
boy likes riding fish trucks.
Hey, you're pretty good at that.
I noticed your boat is named Igrushka Katya...
Katya's Toy.
so that must make you the famous Katya.
I am.
my daddy named it after me.
he was a fisherman.
what do you mean was? Isn't he your daddy?
who? Oh, Dedulya.
no, he's my grandfather.
that's a cute granddaughter you've got.
Yeah.
she's all the family I have left.
her mother died during her birth and her father...
well, her father was not smart.
this used to be his boat.
are you sure you've never met a Vladimir Korchekoff?
no, can't say that I have.
he was Katya's father.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
what's up, baby?
hold on a second.
what can I get you?
uh, a glass of Chardonnay.
uh, box or jug?
surprise me.
what can I get you? - Beer, thanks.
I'm looking for this man. Have you seen him?
what, are you a cop or something?
I'm his doctor.
Nope, sorry.
I think I'd remember if that guy walked in here.
if you do see him, I'm staying at the Bellevue.
okay. I will do.
Thanks.
thank you.
I wonder if she's give me a physical examination.
keep the change.
Hey, Mickey. How'd you do today?
eh, we didn't get out.
too much to fix on that old tub.
we'll get out tomorrow.
but I did find a new mate.
Billy, meet Jake here.
Hey, some bird was just in here a few hours ago looking for him.
for Moscow? - Yeah.
must be mistaken. - Yeah?
well, if you think she ain't, she's staying up the block at the Bellevue.
you work fast, my friend.
they told me you're looking for me down at the bar.
Yes, of course. Please come in.
do we know each other?
um...
I just want to talk with you.
about what?
about you. And some things that I know.
please come in.
you know, we've actually met four times before this, you and I.
I think I'd remember you.
I'd like to tell you a story if you don't mind.
please, have a seat.
my name is Dr. Grace Bishop.
you and I met for the first time two years ago.
an FBI agent named Mason Reese called me in when the police found you on the docks covered in blood.
at the time you said you worked on a Russian freighter.
look, lady...
later at the hospital you couldn't recall any of it.
and two days after that you escaped.
then four months later you were found again, this time believing yourself to be Jonathon Bower, a dock worker.
and then again you disappeared.
look, I don't know who you think I am, but you definitely got...
six times you've awoken that I know of.
this last time we believe you were taken into custody trying to truck illegals over the border from Mexico.
sounds like I've been busy.
okay, look, this isn't a joke. Please, just...
please.
this is who I'm looking for. And him.
you won't remember any of this because your mind won't let you.
this person you think you are now, you made him up.
these people you've made up.
I'm trying to help you. You have to believe me.
Shh.
let's just stay right where we are.
Dr. Grace Bishop, come on out.
we just want to talk with your friend here.
tell her to come out.
come on, tell her to come out.
what's this all about?
we're just gonna wait here for a while.
Why?
it's for your own safety.
so that gun is for my safety?
no. Don't!
is he dead?
he's not exactly the picture of health, is he?
who was he? - I don't know.
he must have followed me home from the bar.
what do we do now?
let's get the hell out of here.
my car is around back.
let's go. Just stay close.
okay.
right here.
are we safe here? - Yeah, for now.
is this yours?
no, the owner said I could stay. I'm working for him.
can I get you something?
you gonna take care of that?
no, it's good. I'm good.
so who do you think that was?
according to you, I don't even know who I am.
you really don't recognize me?
it's like I said before.
I'm trying to but I just don't.
you did this?
Yeah. Kind of a hobby.
I should probably stick to fishing, right?
Where'd you get that?
you gave it to me during one of our first sessions.
look, all I know is before these episodes
I was told that you were an FBI informant inside the Russian mob.
you were involved in busting some drug-trafficking ring.
and then, I don't know, something happened.
Dr. Bishop has quite an obsession with this guy.
I can't believe Agent Reese kept her involvement from us for this long.
I just heard from the Portland field office.
someone meeting our guy's description just confronted one of their agents in Coos Bay.
he fled the scene and now the agent's in critical condition.
you want me to organize transportation?
no, let Portland deal with it.
with this guy's track record he's probably long gone by now.
Where's Reese? - Can't locate him.
he hasn't checked in for hours. - Find him.
I want this. Take it all down. - Yes, sir.
you heard him. Bag it, please.
Uh-huh.
and you know where that is?
all right.
who was that? - A friend.
someone that can help.
he's with the FBI.
right after college a friend and I headed off to Maine.
we spent a summer learning to lobster.
and it was the mornings that got me, you know?
there was always this crispness in the air, the salt on your tongue.
sometimes it was so cold you'd think your fingers were gonna fall off.
the waves and the seagulls, the hum of the motor...
it was the most connected to anything I've ever felt.
and you're telling me I made all that up?
that it never happened?
I don't know if it happened.
maybe.
maybe some of it.
parts of it.
maybe none of it.
I can still taste the salt on my tongue.
how am I supposed to believe this...
what did you call it?
dissociative view.
it just takes over anytime and I won't even know it's happening?
that's how it works.
Why?
to protect you.
there's something that happened, some trauma.
your mind needed to escape and this is how it dealt with it.
by becoming other people?
Yes.
what was the trauma?
truthfully, I don't know.
don't!
you son of a bitch.
it took me a while to put it all together.
I am old man. I don't remember things so good.
but my son told me everything before those Mexicans came and made my Katya an orphan.
I don't know what you're talking about.
you set my son up!
he believed you.
but when you didn't pay them they filled him so full of lead I could use his body as an anchor.
you son of a bitch.
you sorry bastard!
I hope your big ass floats.
for what it's worth, I felt bad for you and your granddaughter.
but I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.
get a warrant to track the doctor's cell.
Yes, sir.
have we heard anything from Reese?
nada.
I want you to go through those tapes.
see if we can come up with any leads.
Yeah.
Hey, you know what's at stake here.
you don't go home until it's done.
Yeah.
you seem to be very popular with people you don't know.
those Russians were about to kill both of us and you don't remember them at all.
no, not a clue.
do you remember when those pictures were taken?
no.
who am I?
look, you're probably inbetween fugue states.
you're more like an amnesiac who just doesn't know who they are.
and that's better?
you're starting to remember who I am, and that's a beginning.
both of you okay? - Barely.
look, we have to get away from here right away.
you know that guy you put into the ICU, he was an FBI agent.
how did he know where we were?
Pickar broke into my computer trying to steal information.
on him? - No, on you, Grace.
on me?
Why? - Why do you think?
they figured you'd lead them to him, and they were right.
and now unfortunately Pickar realizes that he's not gonna go get lost or come in quietly.
he reopened the case and he's heading it up himself personally.
this is crazy. - Look, Pickar is crazy.
he will stop at nothing to erase any evidence against him.
does he remember anything else?
you know, like the numbers?
what numbers?
what the hell could I have done to cause all this?
not something you've done.
it's something you know.
look, follow me. I've got to find us a place to hide.
I'll figure this out.
dude, you have no idea. I mean, no idea.
this place is like turned upside down.
you're now a fugitive. I could go to jail just for talking to you.
who is saying what? - You know that agent in Coos Bay?
he died. Everybody is saying everything.
and your man just made the Most Wanted list.
I am so fucked. - Not if you help me.
that's how I got fucked in the first place.
Harris, you help me you help yourself.
Mason, you need to come in. - I will.
but first I need you to get a message out to Agent Daniels for me.
Harris, are you with me?
a message to Agent Daniels, yeah I can do that.
I need you to tell him that I'm bringing our guy in.
what, the guy? - Just tell him.
tell him to give me about eight hours. He knows the place.
can I count on you, Harris?
what are my options? I can do that, yeah.
where the hell is he? - Just relax. He's taking a shower.
is he all right in there?
just let him take a shower.
grace...
that agent died.
he died?
what was he doing there in the first place?
that's what I've been trying to tell you.
Pickar would just as soon see us all dead before we can prove he's the mole.
he's the FBI. - So am I.
we just need to hold out for a few hours.
Yeah, okay.
grace, our guy wasn't an informant for the Bureau.
he was an agent.
you lied to me?
he was part of a task force whose job was to infiltrate the Russian mob as they were making the move to traffic for the Tijuana drug cartel.
the Bureau bankrolled him and he got in so deep that eventually he became their dealmaker.
and you couldn't tell me that?
nobody knew except Pickar, Daniels and myself.
the mother and daughter we didn't even tell.
we just tucked them away into protective custody.
it just wasn't something you needed to know.
how do you know what I need to know to do my job?
look, before he went crazy, he discovered that there was a mole in the Bureau.
I need him to remember who it was.
but you know it's Pickar.
Yeah, but there's no way I can make a case without his testimony.
and what's with the numbers?
it may be to a safety deposit box, a storage bin where he stashed the Bureau's money that he never paid the cartel.
what are you saying?
that he's in it for the take?
truthfully, I have no idea.
but what I do know now is Pickar would like to see him dead.
and he wouldn't mind if we go too.
has anyone told his family?
you like it?
you're moving us to God knows where.
No!
you know, he's been in there a long time.
what's he doing, curling his hair?
Hey, you okay?
Hey, come on out.
Hey, open the goddamn door.
Damn! - Don't shoot him.
Hey! Hold it right there!
you hear me? I'm counting to three.
one, two, three...
what the hell is wrong with you?
shooting him isn't gonna solve anything.
for Christ's sakes, Grace, I wasn't trying to kill him.
he's our last chance at surviving this without getting heavy jail time.
that's if we don't get killed first.
so you're that good of a shot that you were just aiming to wound him?
I'm not gonna let him disappear on us again.
this is what you're looking for?
Hey, look,
I wasn't actually trying to shoot you, all right?
we're here for your own good.
just put the gun down, please. He's telling the truth.
why don't we all just take a nice little walk?
don't do anything rash. We're all in this together.
together?
I don't know who the hell you all are.
now come on, turn around. Let's start walking.
No!
don't shoot.
you have to listen to me.
give me the keys.
you're just a little confused right now.
you have to believe me. I want to help you.
get in.
get in!
Nope, but it sure feels that way.
how long ago did they leave you, your wife and daughter?
two months.
cleared out everything.
can you tell me anything about what happened before your wife and daughter left you?
was there a fight? An argument?
it was because of my job at the docks.
I wasn't there for them.
look, I just need to know that you're safe.
and how am I supposed to know you're safe?
the Russians are making the deal with the Tijuana cartel.
I need to take this chance.
everything okay?
I have to go to the bathroom.
it's here.
people are after us. Do you understand?
I remember the FBI.
Yeah, them too.
the person you are right now wouldn't happen to know how to hot wire one of those?
find anything on those tapes?
not really.
but just heard from an Oregon Highway Patrolman who says he spotted the doctor's car at a gas station.
thinks it was them that gave chase on a motorcycle.
three people on a motorcycle?
just two. Sound like the doctor and Tomashevsky.
no Agent Reese? - No.
let me guess, they got away.
Yeah, but we did manage to get a lock on the doctor's cell phone.
do you want me to contact the Washington Troopers?
have them put an APB out? - Sure.
but we should be there. - Sir.
you seemed pretty comfortable on the back of that Harley.
I grew up on one.
you rode Harleys?
my brother was a rider.
no kidding? Does he still ride?
no.
he's dead.
I'm sorry.
it's all right.
it's just I don't really talk about him that much.
it was a long time ago.
I understand.
guess it really doesn't matter. You're not gonna remember it anyways.
he killed himself.
do you know why?
he suffered from a mental illness.
I tried to do everything I could to help him, but in the end...
it wasn't enough.
well, we're almost out of gas.
where are we going?
without Mason I'm not sure.
who?
the man that you beat up last night, believe it or not, he was trying to help us.
what are you talking about?
I'm gonna see if I can get ahold of him.
Dr. Bishop. - Yes?
this is Agent Fleming of the FBI.
we know you're in this junkyard with a federal fugitive.
we have this place surrounded.
they're here. - Who?
the FBI.
we do not want to hurt you.
what are we gonna do?
come out now.
we have this place surrounded.
get in. Get in.
in here? - Get in. Don't make a sound.
agent Tomashevsky.
agent Tomashevsky, we know you're in there.
this is Bureau Chief Ronald Pickar.
you'll be helping her and you if you turn yourselves in.
agent Tomashevsky, you're surrounded.
you have no choice. Do the right thing.
give yourself up and no harm will come to you.
it's the end of the line, Tomashevsky.
make the easy choice and we can all go home.
I got him.
get down! Move!
over there! Over there!
you can save him, Dr. Bishop.
just get him to turn himself in.
save yourself, save him. Do it.
come on. - No.
this is Bureau Chief Ronald Pickar.
we've got Dr. Bishop.
it'll be a lot easier on her and you if you turn yourself in.
he's gonna run.
let's see. Just hold on.
come on out. - Hands up.
hands up.
hands up! Behind your head.
turn around.
I don't know.
come on, Tom, you can make this a lot easier on yourself if you just cooperate.
Tom? Tom. Tom.
look, Tom, I don't need you to understand every aspect of this operation.
Tom.
come on.
Where's the money, Tom?
I don't know what you're talking about.
all right, this is your choice.
Pete.
hold him still. Hold him still.
come on, man.
Jesus, you can't treat him like this. What are you giving him?
it's just sodium amobarbital.
we're hoping it'll jog his memory.
you don't get it, do you?
he's not hiding anything by choice.
sodium amobarbital has no credibility.
the subject can be coerced into having a false memory.
that's why you'll be doing the interview.
do you realize that you're protecting someone who has put your life in great danger?
he would never hurt me.
I'm not talking about Agent Tomashevsky, although, I wouldn't be so sure about that.
I'm talking about Agent Mason Reese.
what did he tell you about all this?
you should know.
you're the one that closed the case.
you're the one that's trying to have us killed.
no one's trying to kill anyone here, Dr. Bishop.
and I didn't close the case. That's why we're all here.
we want lawyers.
this has got to come to an end.
how do I know that you're not the leak?
if you please.
Tom.
Tom!
Dr. Bishop would like to speak with you.
how do you feel?
dizzy.
they shouldn't have given you that stuff.
I don't know how they can get away with this stuff.
Hey, what's going on? Hey! - Sit down.
Hey, are you okay?
do you know the name Tomashevsky?
because apparently that's who you are.
No! - I love it, Daddy.
that's a really lovely picture. Is it someone that you know?
I remember the name Lucy.
Lucy.
Lucy.
Lucy? I...
your daughter.
is your daughter named Lucy?
what are you doing here? - Come here.
it's okay. It's okay, I'm Agent Daniels.
we met before with... - Mason. I remember you.
that right. He sent me to get you guys out of here.
you've got to help. You too.
get yourself up. - I don't know if this is a good idea.
ASAP, let's go. Lift.
the gray sedan right over there.
you know, Grace, as soon as Pickar gets that number he gonna want to cover his tracks.
that means you too. It means all of us.
here, get him on here.
I can't take this information to Pickar without your voice mail.
ronald Pickar?
Yeah, that's right. He's remembering.
that's good. That's good.
run. Run.
just go. Run.
just go. Run.
grace! Grace, come back here!
grace!
come here.
I remember the name Lucy.
Lucy.
what are you gonna do with that?
if we see him again it could be a key to unlocking some of his buried memories.
three... three... three...
30... 30... 30...
3041.0
a phone.
what am I supposed to do with this?
enter your password.
what's the password?
you have one unheard message.
press 1 to play.
why did you want to see me?
I needed to take this chance.
are you wearing that wire I gave you? - No.
good. - You sure no one can find us here?
old Heller Mill.
unfortunately shake roofs fell out of favor years ago.
and how's my good old friend Boris doing?
well, he may be an old friend of yours, but he's not such a good friend of mine right now.
look, Tom, I understand you've been through a difficult time.
but I can tell you that your family, they're doing fine in protective custody.
you still got that money I gave you?
you told me not to give it to them and I didn't, even though they killed a man and probably want me dead as well.
I don't need you to understand every aspect of this operation.
but what I can tell you is the Bureau thinks the money is gone.
Yeah, but we know it isn't.
where is it now?
I've got it.
good.
when this is all over, we'll both take a split.
wait a minute.
you told me that with holding that payment would smoke out the rat in the department.
well, it worked.
I should have known you were the mole.
the Bureau's not gonna want their money back?
they think it's gone.
Hey, listen.
if that money doesn't eventually show up, I'm dead...
either from the Russians who know I never made the payment or the Mexicans who never got paid.
the Russians got their dope.
let them have their war.
that's what this whole operation was about.
let them kill each other while you and I get rich.
you're kidding, right?
not when my career and life is on the line.
I'm offering you a partnership where you can make some real dough for all the sacrificing you've done for our country.
that's it if I live.
you can join your wife and daughter in protective custody.
I didn't mind screwing the Tijuana cartel. That was my job.
but I'm not gonna die for a few lousy bucks.
I wouldn't call $2 million a few lousy bucks.
you can buy that pretty little Lucy a whole lot of swing sets.
no.
I'm out.
and so are you.
what do you mean, so am I?
you're wearing that wire, aren't you?
you're wearing that goddamn wire.
I'm not wearing a wire, but you did leave one hell of a message.
Hey, stop right there.
you're making a big mistake, pal. Give me that phone.
it's over, Mason.
don't you understand? You help me, you help yourself.
come back here, you son of a bitch!
look, I just need to know that you're safe.
and how am I supposed to know you're safe?
Hey, I can take care of myself.
wake up, Tomashevsky.
you remember this place, don't you?
you sure no one can find us here?
no, old Heller Mill.
unfortunately shake roofs fell out of favor years ago.
I figured since you've been here before it might jog your memory.
you told me that with holding that payment would smoke out the rat in the department.
well, it worked.
what started here is about to end here one way or another.
either you're gonna remember where you put my money and that recording, or you'll be taking it to your grave.
what is it? Getting dead, as you like to put it.
stiff the Mexicans. Stash the cash.
now what would that do getting me dead?
I've been through a lot of crap with you, including a pair of sore arms.
and just so we understand each other,
I'm emotionally prepared not to get what I want.
there is a number.
I need that number...
and what it belongs to.
304.0
No!
think.
think.
think!
is it a safety deposit box?
what bank? I need some answers.
this is some serious money. - It's 3...
your family is doing well in protective custody.
0...
I can take care of myself, right?
I married you to take care of us.
4...
like it? - I love it, Daddy.
is it a post office box?
a combination? What?
it's 3... - No!
0... 4.
this is the last time we'll be coming here for a while.
if they ever trace you back to the Bureau...
I get it.
your source was right.
the Russians are making a deal with the Tijuana cartel.
I'm telling you, it's someone high up in the Bureau.
everything we know, they know.
so why are we here?
I'm risking my cover to tell you what we already know?
that's precisely why you're here.
this will smoke out the mole in the department.
this is some serious money.
get in between the deal.
stiff the Mexicans. Stash the cash.
now what would that do other than getting me dead?
well, drive the mole crazy.
look, he's gonna be the only one who knows that the money didn't get to the destination. It'll break him.
I know it's 304.
what are the rest of the numbers?!
mental case.
do something.
I think you know by now that he's not kidding.
so if I were you,
I'd give him what he wants.
thank you for the meeting. - Not a problem.
but why me?
I don't know who else to talk to.
I'm trusting you with some very damaging information.
I understand.
do you have the cell phone with you?
no, it's safe.
and the money? - Safer.
Hey, I'm in a lot of jeopardy here.
I understand your situation. - I don't think you do.
agent Reese needs to be brought into custody before I turn the money over.
I...
I can't take this information to Pickar without the voice mail.
did you happen to make a copy of it?
I'll figure out how to get it to you when the time is right.
he's the only superior you ever talked to.
not only do I see your memory improving...
but I see a marked improvement in your reasoning skills.
so reason this...
if I don't hear those numbers from your mouth in the next three seconds,
I'm gonna blow your head off.
just wanted to let you know that I'm not kidding.
not when my career and life is on the line.
I didn't mind screwing the Tijuana cartel. That was my job.
but I'm not gonna die for a few lousy bucks.
you set my son up!
they filled him so full of lead I could use his body as an anchor.
how's my dear old friend Boris doing?
well, he may be an old friend of yours, but he's not such a good friend of mine right now.
come back here, you son of a bitch!
I know where your family lives!
No!
so for the last time...
3...
0...
4...
1.0
you were almost right, Mason.
it was a post office box. But the money wasn't there.
what?
that's it?
it was a four-digit number?
Where's my money?
you were dead right about one thing.
he did record the conversation.
I'm sorry you heard that.
what did you do with the recording?
I gave it to my new best friends.
and they'll be here any second.
you went to Pickar, didn't you?
and you sent that agent to Coos Bay, didn't you?
but I didn't tell him to attack you.
well, you're very thoughtful.
but you always were thoughtful, weren't you?
all right, basket case.
Where's my money?
I think it's a mistake.
we've been over this before. It's my job.
it's your job pulling your daughter out of school, away from her friends, moving us to God knows where?
okay, everybody ready for cake?
okay, you've got to make a wish.
Yay. Okay. Everyone sing.
look, I just need to know that you're safe.
and how am I supposed to know you're safe?
Hey, I can take care of myself, right?
but I married you to take care of us.
we'll be okay.
I don't want to be away from you for a year.
what if something happened to you?
Hey, stop that now.
when this is over, I promise I'll come in and do a 9: 00 to 5: 00.
I love you.
I love you.
if that money doesn't eventually show up, I'm dead.
did you do it?
the wife's car is rigged to blow the next time she starts it.
good, that should get his attention.
all right, who wants cake?
got one more for you.
here you go.
you like it?
Yeah, I love it. I love it, Daddy.
so...
for the last time, what did you do with the money?
come on, you know you lose.
don't!
don't let go.
please.
help me.
you help me, you help yourself.
don't you understand? You help me, you help yourself.
Tom, don't let go.
please, pull me up.
did you do it?
the wife's car is rigged to blow the next time she starts it.
good, that should get his attention.
now I know why I couldn't remember who I was.
it was too hard to remember what I lost.
please, don't.
don't!
you okay?
we got the phone and I heard the call.
we got enough to indict Mason.
you're too late.
too late? Too late for what?
they're dead.
all of them?
no, Tomashevsky is gone.
he acted in self-defense.
if he acted in self-defense, then why is he running?
that's what I've been trying to figure out.
sir, Agent Reese and Daniels are deceased.
Tomashevsky? - No sign.
keep looking. - Sir.
you're not gonna find him.
your car was impounded.
let me give you a lift.
Hello?
Dr. Bishop, this is Tom Tomashevsky.
Tom.
you know you've been totally cleared of everything?
the Bureau just wants their money back.
Oh, they're gonna get their money back.
if you ever need me, I'm here for you.
Tom, have you come to grips with who you are?
I'm still not 100% sure who I am.
but I remember what I've got to do.
the Sunset Limited
so what am I supposed to do with you, Professor?
why are you supposed to do anything?
well, like I said, this ain't none of my doing.
when I left out of here going to work this morning you wasn't no part of my plans, but here you is.
doesn't mean anything. Everything that happened doesn't mean something else.
what's it mean then?
doesn't mean anything. You run into people.
and maybe some of them are in trouble or whatever, but it doesn't mean you're responsible for them.
Mm-hmm.
anyway, people who are always looking out for perfect strangers are very often people who won't look out for the ones they're supposed to look out for, in my opinion.
if you're just doing what you're supposed to, you don't get to be a hero.
and that would be me?
I don't know. Would it?
I can see how there might be some truth in that, but in this particular case I got to say I didn't know what sort of person I was supposed to be on the look out for or what I was supposed to do when I found them.
in this particular case but one thing to go by.
and that was?
that was that they is standing there and I have to look at them and say, "Now he don't look like my brother, but there he is, so maybe you'd better look again."
and that's what you did?
well, I got to say you was kind of hard to ignore.
your approach was pretty direct.
I didn't approach you. I didn't even see you.
what I don't understand is how you come to get yourself in such a fix.
Yeah.
are you all right? Did you sleep last night?
no.
well, when did you decide that today was the day?
was there something special about it?
no.
well, today is my birthday, but I certainly don't regard that as special.
well, Happy Birthday, Professor.
thank you.
so you seen your birthday was coming and that seemed like a good day?
who knows? Maybe birthdays are dangerous, like Christmas...
ornaments hanging from the trees, reeds from the doors and bodies from the steampipes all over America.
that don't say much for Christmas, do it?
Christmas is not what it used to be.
now I believe that to be a true statement. I surely do.
I've got to go.
you always put your coat on like that?
what's wrong with the way I put my coat on?
I ain't said nothing was wrong with it.
I'm just asking if that's your regular method.
I don't have a regular method. I just put it on. - Mm-hmm.
it's what... Effeminate? What?
I'm just studying the ways of professors.
well, I've got to go.
let me get my coat.
get your coat? - Yeah.
where are you going? - Going with you.
what do you mean? Going with me where?
going with you wherever it is you're going.
no, you're not. - Yeah, I am.
I'm going home. - All right.
all right? You're not going home with me.
sure I am. Let me get my coat.
you can't go home with me. - Why?
you can't. - Oh, what, you can go home with me but I can't go home with you?
no. I mean, no, that's not it.
I just need to go home.
you live in an apartment? - Yes.
what, they don't let black folk in there? - No.
I mean, yes, of course they do.
look, no more jokes. I've got to go. I'm very tired.
all right, long as you don't run into no hassle about getting me in there.
you're serious. - Oh, I think you know I'm serious.
you can't be serious. - I'm serious as a heart attack.
why are you doing this? - Me? I ain't got no choice.
of course you have a choice. - No, I ain't.
who appointed you my guardian angel?
you know who appointed me your guardian angel.
now look, I ain't ask for you to jump into my arms - down at the subway this morning. - I didn't jump into your arms.
you didn't? - No.
well, how'd you get there then?
what? Now we ain't going?
do you really think Jesus is in this room?
no.
I don't think he's in this room.
I know he's in this room.
it's the way you put it, Professor.
it'd be like me asking you if you think you got your coat on.
it's not the same thing. It's a matter of agreement.
if you and I say that I have my coat on and Cecil says that I'm naked and have green skin and a tail, we might want to think about where we should put Cecil so he doesn't hurt himself.
who's Cecil?
he's not anybody. He's just a hypothetical.
there's not any Cecil. He's just a character
I made up to illustrate a point.
made up? - Yes.
so his view of things don't count?
no. That's why I made him up.
I could have changed things around. I could have made you the one who didn't think I was wearing a coat.
and was green and all that other shit you said?
Yes. - But you didn't.
no. - You load it all off on Cecil.
Yes.
but Cecil can't defend himself on account that he ain't in agreement with everybody else, so his word don't count, aside from the fact that you made him up and he's green and everything.
he's not the one who's green. I am. Where is this going?
I'm just trying to find out about Cecil.
I don't think so.
can you see Jesus?
no, I can't see him.
but you talk to him. - Don't miss a day.
and he talks to you. - I have heard him, yes.
do you hear him, like, out loud?
no no, not out loud. I don't hear a voice.
I don't hear my own, for that matter.
but I have heard him.
but why couldn't Jesus just be in your head?
he is in my head.
well, then I don't understand what it is you're trying to tell me.
I know you don't, honey. Look, the first thing you got to understand is
I ain't got an original thought in my head.
if it ain't got the lingering scent of divinity to it, - I ain't interested in it. - The lingering scent of divinity.
Yeah, you like that? - It's not bad.
heard it on the radio... a black preacher.
the point is, is I done tried it the other way.
I don't mean no chipping neither.
I mean blindfold, running through the woods, bit in my teeth...
Lord, didn't I try it!
if you can find somebody gave it a better shot than me,
I'd like to meet him, I surely would.
and what you think that got me?
I don't know. What did it get you?
life in death is what it got me.
life in death.
too dead to even know enough to lay down.
I see.
I don't think so.
let me ask you a question.
all right.
you ever read this book?
I've read parts of it. I've read in it.
have you ever read it?
read the book of "Job."
have you ever read it?
no.
but you is read a lot of books? - Yes.
how many, you say? - I have no idea.
ballpark.
two a week, maybe 100 a year for close to 40 years.
two a week...
40 times 100 is 4000.
I'm just messing with you, Professor.
tell you what... Give me a number, any number you like, and I'll give you 40 times it back.
4720 - 4720. - Yep.
the answer is the question. - Say what?
that's your new number. - 4720?
that's a big number, Professor. - Yes, it is.
you know the answer? - No, I don't.
let me see that.
how do you do that?
numbers are the black man's friend...
butter and eggs, crap table.
you quick with numbers, you can work the mojo on your brother, confiscate the contents of his pocketbook.
you get a lot of time to practice that shit in the jailhouse.
I see.
let's get back to you and all these books you read.
you say you done read 4000 books?
probably, maybe more than that.
but not this book.
uh, no, not the whole...
why is that? - I don't know.
well, what would you say is the best book ever wrote?
I have no idea.
well, take a shot.
there are a lot of good books.
pick one.
maybe "War and Peace." - All right.
do you think that book's as good as this one?
I don't know. They're different kinds of books.
this "War and Peace" book... It's a book somebody made up, right?
well, yes.
so is that what makes it different from this here book?
no, in my view they're both made up.
ain't neither one of them true?
not in the historical sense, no.
hmm.
well, what would be a true book?
I suppose maybe a history book.
gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" might be one.
at least the events would be actual events.
they would be things that had happened.
hmm.
so you think that book is as good a book as this book?
the Bible? - The Bible.
I don't know. Gibbon's is a cornerstone. It's a major book.
and a true book. Don't forget that. - And a true book, yes.
but is it as good a book?
I don't know.
I don't know as you can make a comparison.
we're talking about apples and pears.
we ain't talking about no apples and pears, Professor.
we're talking about books.
is that "Decline and Fall" book as good a book as this here book?
answer the question.
I'm gonna have to say no.
used to say right here on the cover fore it got wore down...
the greatest book ever written.
think that might be true? - It might.
you read good books. - I try to, yes.
but you ain't read the best book.
why is that? - I've got to go.
you don't need to go, Professor. Just stay here and visit with me.
you afraid I'll go back to the train station.
you might, so just stay here with me.
what if I promised I wouldn't?
you might anyway.
don't you need to go to work?
I was on my way to work.
a funny thing happened to you on the way to work.
Yes, it did.
will they fire you?
no, they ain't gonna fire me.
you could call in. - Ain't got no phone.
anyhow, they know if I ain't there by now
I ain't coming. I ain't a late sort of person.
why don't you have a phone? - Don't need one.
junkies would steal it anyway.
get a cheap one.
don't get too cheap for a junkie.
let's get back to you.
let's stick with you for a minute.
can I ask you something? - Sure you can.
where were you standing? I never saw you.
you mean when you took your amazing leap?
Yes. - I was on the platform.
on the platform? - Yeah.
well, I didn't see you.
I was standing on the platform, minding my own business.
here you come hauling ass.
I looked all around to make sure there was no one there, particularly no children.
there was nobody around.
no, just me.
well, I don't know where you could have been.
fixing to get spooky on me here, Professor?
maybe I was behind a post or something.
there wasn't any post.
so what are you saying... You're looking at some big black angel got sent down here to snatch your honky ass out of there at the last possible minute and save you from destruction?
no, I don't think that.
such a thing ain't possible? - No, it isn't.
well, you're the one suggested it.
I never suggested any such thing.
you're the one who put in the stuff about angels.
I never said anything about angels. I don't believe in angels.
well, what is it you believe in?
a lot of things.
all right.
all right what? - All right, what things?
I believe in things. - Give me a for instance.
um, cultural things, for instance, books, music, art, things like that.
all right.
those are the things that have value to me.
they're the foundations of civilization.
well, they used to have value to me.
they don't have so much value anymore, I guess.
what happened to them?
people stopped valuing them. I stopped valuing them to a certain extent.
I'm not sure I can tell you why.
that world is largely gone now.
soon it will be wholly gone.
I'm not sure I'm following you, Professor.
there's nothing to follow. It's all right.
the things I loved were very frail, very fragile.
I didn't know that. I thought they were indestructible.
they weren't.
and that's what sent you off the edge of the platform?
it wasn't nothing personal?
Oh, it's personal. That's what an education does.
it makes the world personal.
well, them's some very powerful words, Professor.
and I can't say that I got an answer to none of that.
and it might be that there ain't no answer.
but still I got to ask.
what's the use of having notions such as them if they won't keep you glued down to the platform when the Sunset Limited is coming through at 80mph?
good question. - I thought so.
I don't have an answer to any of that either.
maybe it's not logical. I don't know. I don't care.
I've been asked, didn't I think it odd that I should be around to witness the death of everything?
I do think it's odd.
but that doesn't mean it isn't so.
somebody has to be here.
but you don't intend to hang around for it?
no, I don't.
let me see if I got this straight.
you're saying that all this culture stuff is the only thing between you and the Sunset Limited.
it's a lot. - But it busted out on you.
Yes.
you're a culture junkie.
maybe you're right.
maybe I have no beliefs.
I believe in the Sunset Limited.
damn, Professor.
damn indeed.
no beliefs?
the things I believed in no longer exist.
it's foolish to pretend they do.
WESTERN civilization finally went up in smoke in the chimneys of Dachau, and I was too infatuated to see it.
I see it now.
hoo!
you're a challenge, Professor, you know that?
well, there's no reason for you to become involved in my problems.
I should go.
have you got any friends? - No.
come on, Professor, not one? - Not really, no.
tell me about that one. - What one?
the "not really" one. - I have a friend at the university...
not a close friend. We have lunch from time to time.
but that's about as good as it gets?
Yes.
What'd you do to him?
What'd I do to him? - Yeah.
I didn't do anything to him.
what makes you think I did something to him?
I don't know. Did you?
no.
what is it you think I did to him?
I don't know. I want you to tell me.
there's nothing to tell.
you didn't leave him a note or nothing - to tell him you've taken the train? - No.
your best friend? - He's not my best friend.
I thought we just got done deciding he was.
you just got done deciding he...
did you ever tell him you was thinking about this?
no. Why should I? - 'Cause he's your best friend.
he's... I told you, we're not all that close.
you're not all that close? - No.
he's your best friend, only you ain't all that close?
if you'd like.
not the way you'd want to bother him with a little thing like suicide?
look, suppose I were to give you my word that I would just go home and I wouldn't try to kill myself in route.
suppose I was to give you my word that I wouldn't listen to none of your bullshit.
so what am I, a prisoner here?
you know better than that.
you was a prisoner before you got here...
a death row prisoner.
what did your daddy do?
what?
I said what did your daddy do...
what kind of work?
he was a lawyer.
a lawyer? - Yeah.
what kind of law did he do?
he was a government lawyer. He didn't do criminal law or anything like that.
what would be a thing like criminal law?
I don't know. Divorce law maybe.
Mm-hmm.
maybe you got a point.
What'd he die of?
who said he was dead?
is he dead? - Yes.
what did he die of?
cancer.
cancer. So he was sick for a while?
Yes, he was.
did you go see him? - No.
how come? - I didn't want to.
how come you didn't want to?
I don't know. I just didn't.
maybe I didn't want to remember him that way.
mm, bullshit.
did he ask you to come?
no.
but your mama did. - She may have. I don't remember.
come on, Professor. You know she asked you to come.
okay, yes.
what did you tell her? - I said I would.
but you didn't? - No.
how come? - He died.
no no, that ain't it.
you had time to go see him, but you didn't do it.
I suppose.
you waited till he was dead.
okay, so I didn't go see my father.
your father is laying on his deathbed dying of cancer.
your mama's sitting there with him, holding his hand.
he's in all kind of pain.
they ask you to come see him one last time before he died.
and you tell them, "No, I ain't coming."
please tell me I got some part of this wrong.
if that's the way you want to put it.
well, how would you put it? - I don't know.
well, that's the way it is then, ain't it?
I suppose. - No, ain't no suppose.
is it or ain't it? - Yes.
Whoo!
let me see if I can find my train schedule, see when that next uptown express is due.
I'm not sure I see the humor.
I'm glad to hear you say that, professor, cause I ain't sure either.
I get more amazed by the minute.
how come you can't see yourself, honey?
you're clear as glass.
I can see the wheels in there turning, the gears.
I can see light too... good light, true light. Can't you see it?
no, I can't.
well, bless you, brother.
bless and keep you, cause it's there.
when were you in the penitentiary?
a long time ago. - What were you in for?
murder. - Really?
now who would claim to be a murderer that wasn't one?
you called it the jailhouse.
Yeah.
do most black people call the penitentiary the jailhouse?
no, just us old country niggers.
we make a point to call things what they is.
I'd hate to think how many names there is for the jailhouse.
I'd hate to have to count them.
do you have a lot of jailhouse stories?
jailhouse stories? - Yeah.
I don't know.
I used to tell jailhouse stories, but they kind of lost their charm.
why don't we talk about something that's a little more cheerful?
you ever been married?
married?
Yeah. - Oh man.
what?
Oh...
maybe we ought to take another look at them jailhouse stories.
Oh my.
hoo!
do you have any children?
no, professor. I ain't got nobody.
everybody in my family's dead.
I had two boys, but they died a long time ago.
just about everybody I ever knowed has died, for that matter.
you ought to think about that.
I might be a hazard to your health.
were you always in a lot of trouble?
Yeah, I was.
I liked it.
I think I still do.
I done seven years hard time.
could have done a lot more. Hurt a lot of people.
I used to smack them around, and they wouldn't get up no more.
but you don't get in trouble now? - No.
but you still like it?
well, maybe I'm just condemned to it, bit in the ass by my own karma.
but I'm on the other side now.
you want to help folk that's in trouble, you pretty much got to go where the trouble's at.
you ain't got a lot of choice.
how long have you been here?
Oh, six... going on seven years.
I don't understand why you live here.
as opposed to where?
anywhere.
well, this pretty much is anywhere.
I could live in another building, I suppose, but it's all right.
I got my bedroom over yonder where I can get away, got a sofa where folk can crash...
junkies and crackheads mostly.
of course they're gonna walk off with all your portables, so you can't own nothing. But that's good.
you hang out with the right crowd, you pretty much get over all your worldly cravings.
they took the refrigerator one time, but somebody caught them out there on the stairs, made them bring it back up.
now I got that big sucker over yonder...
traded up.
only thing I miss is the music.
I aim to get me a steel door.
then I can have me some music here.
but you got to buy the door and the frame at the same time.
I'm working on that.
I don't care nothing about television, but I sure do miss the music.
you don't think this is a terrible place?
a terrible place?
Yes.
what are you talking about?
this place. It's a horrible place full of horrible people.
Oh my.
you must know that these people are not worth saving even if they could be saved, which they can't. You must know that.
well, I like a challenge.
I started a ministry fore I got out of prison.
now that was a challenge.
there was a lot of brothers who showed up.
they ain't care nothing about it.
they ain't really care nothing about the word of God.
they just wanted it on the resume.
resume? - Resume.
you got some brothers in there had done some real bad shit.
and they weren't sorry about a damn thing except getting caught.
but the funny thing was a lot of them did believe in God, even more so than a lot of these people out here on the outside.
I know I did.
you ought to think about that, professor.
I think I'd better go. - Oh, hey hey.
you ain't got to go, professor.
let me ask you something.
you ever had one of them days where everything was just weird all the way around when things just kind of fell into place?
I'm not sure what you mean.
just one of them days kind of magic, one of them days where everything turned out right.
I don't know. Maybe. Why?
well, I'm just wondering if it ain't been maybe sort of long dry spell for you till you took up with the notion that that's the way the world is.
the way the world is? - Yeah.
and how is that? - You know, long and dry.
but the point is that even if you feel that way, what you got to understand is that the sun don't shine up the same dog's ass every day.
you understand what I'm saying?
if what you're saying is that I'm simply having a bad day, that's ridiculous.
I ain't saying you're having a bad day, professor.
I'm saying you're having a bad life.
you think I should change my life?
what, you shitting me? - I have to go.
look, just hang with me a little while longer.
what about my jailhouse story?
you don't need no jailhouse story.
why not?
well, you're suspicious about everything already.
you think I'm trying to put you in the trick bag.
and you're not?
well yeah, but I don't want you to know it.
well, in any case, I have to go.
you ain't ready to go back out there on them streets.
I have to. - I know you ain't got nothing you got to do.
how do you know that? - Cause you ain't even supposed to be here.
I see your point.
what if I tell you a jailhouse story?
will you stay then?
all right. I'll stay a while.
all right! The man says all right.
okay, here go my jailhouse story.
is it a true story?
Oh yeah, it's a true story.
I don't know no other kind.
one day I'm in the chow line and I'm getting my chow when the nigger in the line behind me gets into it with the server, says the beans is cold.
so he throws the ladle down in the beans.
well, when he done that there was beans splashed up on me.
well, I didn't want to get into it over no beans, but it did kinda piss me off some.
I'd just put on a clean uniform...
you know, khakis, shirt and trousers.
and you only get two a week.
so I said something to him like "Hey man, watch it" or something like that.
but I went on. I'm telling myself, "Just let it go. Just let it go."
but then the nigger said something.
so I turned back.
and when I done that, he stuck a knife in me.
I ain't even see it coming. Blood's just flying everywhere.
this wasn't no jailhouse shiv neither.
this was one of them Italian switchblades...
one of them black-and-silver jobs.
well, I ain't do a thing but duck and step back under the rail.
and I reached out and I got hold of this table leg.
and it come off in my hand just as easy.
it had this long screw sticking out the end of it.
and I went to wailing on that nigger's head!
and I ain't quit!
I ain't quit till you couldn't tell it was a head no more!
that screw was stick in his head and I'd have to put my foot on him to pull it out.
What'd he say? - What'd he say?
I mean in the line. What did he say?
I ain't gonna repeat it. - That doesn't seem fair.
don't seem fair? - No.
here I am telling you a bona fide blood-and-guts tale from the big house, the genuine article, and I can't get you to fill in the blanks about what the nigger said?
do you have to use that word? - Use that word?
Yes. - We ain't making much progress here, is we?
it just seems unnecessary.
you don't want to hear "nigger,"
but you about to bail out on me cause I won't tell you some ugly shit the nigger said? Is you sure about this?
I just don't see why you have to use that word.
it's my story, ain't it?
anyway, I don't remember there being no African-Americans or people of color in there.
to my recollection there was only a bunch of niggers!
go ahead.
now at some point
I musts pulled the knife out and...
and dropped on the floor somewhere.
meanwhile, I'm still wailing on this nigger's head, but his friend has got ahold of me from behind.
but I got one hand on the rail so I ain't going nowhere.
but what I don't know is that this dude musts picked up the knife and he's trying to gut me.
I felt the blood. I turned around and I bust him in the head.
and he went skittering off across the floor.
and by now somebody done pushed the button and the alarm is going.
everybody's down on the floor and we in lockdown.
the guard up on the rail...
he got his shotgun pointed at me and he's hollering, "You! Get on the floor and drop the weapon!"
he's about to shoot me when the lieutenant tells him, "Hold your fire! You! Throw down that club!|"
I looked around, and I was the only one standing.
I see the nigger's feet sticking out from under the counter where he'd done crawled.
so I throwed the thing down.
I don't remember much after that.
they... they told me
I had lost almost half my blood.
I remember slipping around in it, but I thought it was the other dude's.
did the man die?
no, he didn't.
everybody lived.
they thought he was dead, but he wasn't.
he wasn't right after that, so I ain't really had no more trouble out of him.
he walked around with his head kinda to the side, lost one eye, arm's hanging down, didn't talk right.
they shipped him off to another facility.
but that's not the whole story.
no, it ain't. - So what happened?
I woke up in the infirmary.
they had already done operated on me.
my spleen was cut open, liver, I don't know what all.
I come pretty close to dying.
I had 280 stitches holding me together and, whoo, I was hurting.
I didn't know you could hurt that much.
and still they had me in leg irons and had me handcuffed to the bed, if you can believe that.
now as I lay there,
I heard this voice just as clear, couldn't have been no clearer.
and the voice said, "If it was not for the grace of God you would not be here."
man, I tried to sit up and look around, but I couldn't.
wasn't no need to nohow, cause wasn't nobody there.
I mean, there was somebody there all right, but wasn't no need for me looking around to see if I could see him.
you don't think this is a strange kind of story?
Yeah, I do think it's a strange kind of story.
no, what I mean is that you didn't feel sorry for this man.
Oh, you getting ahead of the story.
the story of how a fellow inmate became a crippled one-eyed halfwit so that you could find God.
Whoa-ho. - Well, isn't it?
I don't know. - You hadn't thought of it that way?
Oh yeah, hell, I thought of it that way.
well, isn't that the true story?
look, Professor, I don't want to get on the wrong side of you.
and you seem to have a powerful wish for that to be the story, so I got to say that is one way of looking at it.
I gotta concede that. Gotta keep you interested.
string me along. - You all right with that?
and then put me in the... What is it? The trick bag?
Yeah. - Right.
you got to remember - this is a jailhouse story. - All right.
which you specifically asked for. - All right.
the point is, Professor,
I ain't got the first notion in the world about what makes God tick. I don't know why he spoke to me.
I know I wouldn't have. - But you listened.
what choice would you have? - I don't know.
not listen.
you think he goes around talking to people he knows ain't gonna listen to him in the first place?
you think he got that kind of free time?
why is it you people cat just accept it that some people don't even want to believe in God?
I can accept that. - You can?
sure I can. Meaning I believe that to be a fact.
I mean I'm looking at it every day, so I'd better accept it.
then why can't you leave us alone?
Oh, to be hanging from steampipes and all that?
if that's what we want to do, yes.
because he said not to.
it's in here.
don't you want to be happy? - Happy?
what, you got something against being happy?
God help us. - What, I done opened up a can of worms?
what you got against being happy?
it's contrary to the human condition.
contrary to your condition. I gotta agree with that.
happy?
what, like there ain't no such thing?
not for nobody?
no.
how did we get ourselves in such a fix as this?
we were born in such a fix as this.
suffering and human destiny are the same thing.
each is a description of the other.
we ain't talking about no suffering.
we're talking about being happy.
you can't be happy if you're in pain. - Why not?
you're not making any sense.
Oh, them is some hard words from the Professor.
the preacher has fell back.
he's clutching his heart.
his eyes is rolled back in his head.
wait a minute. Wait a minute, folks.
the preacher's blinking. He's coming back.
he's coming back.
the point is, Professor, that if you ain't got no pain in your life, how would you even know when you was happy?
as compared to what?
you don't have anything to drink around here, do you?
no, I don't.
is you a drinking man?
are we about to get a temperance lecture? - Not from me.
it's been a difficult day.
I take it you don't drink.
no, I don't.
I've done my share of it in my time though.
are you in A. A?
no no, no A. A. I just quit.
I've had a lot of friends who was drinkers though...
most of them for that matter. Most of them dead too.
from drinking?
well, from drinking or reasons not too far from it.
I had a friend get run down not too long ago by a taxicab.
now where you think he was headed drunk?
I don't know. Where was he going?
to get more whisky.
he had plenty at the house, but drunks are always scared they're gonna run out.
was he killed?
I hope so. We buried him.
I suppose there's a moral to this story.
just a story about what you get and what you want.
pain... happiness.
let me tell you another one.
one Sunday we are all sitting around the house drinking... a Sunday morning.
well, here come this friend of ours with this girl Evelyn.
now Evelyn was drunk when she got there, but we told her, "Go on and get yourself a drink."
well, directly, my buddy Reg...
he goes in the kitchen to fix himself a drink.
only now the bottle is gone.
now Reg has been around a few drinking people in his time and commences to hunt for the bottle.
he looks in the cabinet, looks behind everything, but he can't find it.
of course he knows what's happened to it.
so he comes back in the living room, sits down, looks at Evelyn sitting there on the sofa drunk as a goat.
and he says, "Evelyn, where you put the whisky?"
Evelyn says...
he says, "Evelyn, where did you hide the whisky?"
and she...
well, Reg is sitting there and this is beginning to piss him off a little, so he gets in her face and he says,
and she says, "I hid it in the toilet."
that's pretty funny.
Oh, I thought you'd like that.
and is that where the whisky was?
Oh, yeah yeah. That's a favorite place for drunks to hide a bottle.
but the point is that the drunk's concern ain't that he's going to die from drinking... which he is...
but that he's going to run out of whisky before he get a chance to do it.
is you hungry?
cause I can come back to this. I ain't gonna lose my place.
no, I'm all right. Go ahead.
if you was to hand a drunk a drink and tell him he don't want it, what do you think he'd say?
I think I know what he would say.
sure you do. And you would be right.
about him not really wanting it? - Yes.
because what he wants he can't get, or thinks he can't get, so what he really don't want he can't get enough of.
so what is it he really wants?
well, you know what he really wants.
no, I don't. - Yes, you do.
no, I don't.
you don't know what he wants?
no, I do not.
he wants what everybody wants.
and that is?
he wants to be loved by God.
I don't want to be loved by God.
see, I love that. I love the way you cut right to it.
see, he don't either, according to him.
all he wants is a drink of whisky.
now you're a smart man, Professor.
now tell me which one makes sense and which one don't.
I don't want a drink of whisky either.
I thought you just got done asking for one.
I mean as a general proposition.
we ain't talking about no general proposition. We're talking about a drink.
I don't have a drinking problem. - You got some kind of problem.
well, whatever kind of problem I have, it is not something that I imagine can be addressed with a drink of liquor.
Mm! I love the way you put that.
well, what can it be addressed with?
I think you know what it can be addressed with.
the Sunset Limited.
Yes.
that's what you really want.
that is what I want, yes.
well, that's a mighty big drink of whisky, Professor.
that I don't really want? - That you don't really want, yes.
well, I think I do want it. - Of course you do, honey.
if you didn't, we wouldn't be sitting here.
I disagree with you.
all right, but that's the hand I'm playing.
I don't think you understand that people such as myself look upon this yearning for God as something lacking in these people.
sure I do. I couldn't agree more.
you agree with that?
Yes. What's lacking is God.
I am sorry, but to me this whole idea of God is just a load of crap.
Oh lord have mercy!
Jesus help us.
the Professor's done gone and blasphemed all over us.
we ain't never gonna be saved now.
you don't find that an evil thing to say?
no, Professor, I don't. But you does.
no, I don't. It's simply a fact.
no, it ain't simply no fact.
now that's the biggest fact about you.
in fact, it might just be the only fact.
but you don't seem to think it's so bad.
no, cause I know it to be curable.
now if you're asking me what the man up there thinks about it, well, I imagine he done heard it so much that it don't bother him all that much.
I mean, what if somebody told you you didn't exist and you was sitting right there listening to him say it?
that wouldn't piss you off, would it?
no, you'd just feel sorry for them.
right, and you might even try to get some help for them.
now in my case he had to holler out loud, me laying on a slab in two pieces, sewed back together where some nigger done tried to core me like an apple.
but God being God, he can speak to your heart at any time.
and furthermore, if he spoke to me...
which he did...
he can speak to anybody.
wonder what this crazy nigger's fixing to do now.
he's liable to put the mojo on me.
he'll be speaking in tongues here directly.
I need to get my ass out of here.
he's liable to steal my pocketbook.
I need to get my ass on down to that depot 'fore something bad happens to me.
Hey!
what are we gonna do with you, Professor?
look, I know I owe you a great deal, at least in the eyes of the world.
couldn't I just give you something and we could call it square?
I'll give you some money, something like that.
I can give you $1000.
well, that's not very much, I guess.
I can give you $3000, say.
you ain't got no notion of the trouble you're in, do you?
I don't know what you mean. - I know you don't.
I'd just like to settle this in some way.
ain't me you got to settle with.
do you really think I was sent to you by God?
no, it's worse than that.
how do you mean?
belief ain't like unbelief.
if you're a believer and you finally got to come to the well of belief itself, then you ain't got to look no further. There ain't no further.
but the unbeliever's got a problem.
he's set out to unravel the world.
for everything he can point to that ain't true, he leaves two things laying there.
do you really believe everything that's in there... the Bible?
the literal truth?
Yes.
probably not, but then you already know I'm an outlaw.
what is it you would disagree with?
probably the notion of original sin...
you know, when Eve ate the apple, turned everybody bad.
I don't see people that way.
I think for the most part people was good to begin with.
I think evil is something you bring on your own self, mostly from wanting things you ain't supposed to have.
but I ain't gonna stand here and tell you about me being a heretic when I'm trying to get you to quit being one.
are you a heretic?
is you trying to put me in the trick bag, Professor?
no, I'm not.
are you?
no more than what a man ought to be, even a man with a powerful belief.
I ain't a doubter, but I am a questioner.
what's the difference?
a questioner wants the truth.
a doubter wants to be told there ain't no such thing.
you don't think you have to believe everything that's in there - in order to be saved? - No, not at all.
I don't even think you have to read it.
I ain't even for sure you even got to know there is such a book.
I think whatever truth is wrote in the pages of this book is wrote in the human heart too, and was wrote there a long time ago, and will be wrote there a long time hence, even if every copy of this book is burned... every copy of it.
and what Jesus said... I don't think he made up a word of it.
he just told it.
this book is a guide for the ignorant and the sick at heart.
a whole man wouldn't need it at all.
and if you was to read this book, you're gonna find there's more talk in here about the wrong way than there is the right way. Why is that?
I don't know. Why is it?
why don't you tell me?
I'll have to think about that.
okay. - Okay what?
okay, go on and think about it.
it might take me a little longer than you to think about something.
that's all right. - That's all right?
Yeah. I mean, I can take that statement in one or two ways.
I'm going to take it the good way cause that's my nature.
that way I get to live in my world and not yours.
what makes you think mine is so bad?
I don't think it's so bad.
I just know it's brief.
all right.
I think the answer to your question is that the dialectic of the homily always presupposes a ground of evil.
man. - How's that?
that's strong as a mare's breath, Professor.
Whoo! Wouldn't I love to lay some shit like that on the brothers. Whoa.
it's just the two of us sitting here in private, talking.
What'd you just say?
your question...
the Bible is full of cautionary tales...
all of literature, for that matter...
telling us to be careful. Careful of what?
taking the wrong turn, the wrong path.
how many wrong paths are there?
their number is legion.
how many right paths? Just one.
hence the imbalance that you spoke of.
man.
you know, you could go on TV, Professor, a good-looking man like yourself. You know that?
stop. - I'm serious.
I wasn't even sure you was a Professor till you laid that shit on me.
now I think you're having fun at my expense.
no, I ain't. - Well, I think you are.
honey, I swear I ain't.
I couldn't say a thing like you just got done saying.
I admire that.
and why do you keep calling me honey?
that's just the old South talking. It don't mean nothing.
I'll try and stop if it bothers you.
I'm just not sure what it means.
it means you're among friends.
it means quit worrying about everything.
that might be easier said than done.
Yeah, you're right. It might.
but we're just talking... talking.
tell me something. - Sure.
why are you here? What do you get out of this?
you seem like a smart man.
me?
I'm just a dumb country nigger from Louisiana.
I done told you, I ain't never had the first thought in my head.
if it ain't in here, I don't know it.
sometimes I think you're having fun with me.
I don't see how you can live here.
I don't know how you can feel safe.
well, you got a point, Professor, about being safe anyway.
you ever stopped any of these people from taking drugs?
not that I know of.
then what is the point? I don't get it.
I mean, it's hopeless. This places is a moral leper colony.
damn.
moral leper colony. Where's my pencil at?
I ain't never gonna want you to leave. Put this in my book.
in the moral leper colony.
I like the sound of that.
I still don't see how you can live here.
why not go someplace where you can do the world some good?
as opposed to someplace where good is needed?
even God gives up at some point.
there's no ministry in hell that I ever heard of.
no, there ain't. And that's well put.
ministry is for the living.
that's why you're responsible for your brother.
once he quit breathing you can't help him no more.
he's in the hands of other parties.
so you got to look after him now.
you might even want to monitor his train schedule.
you think you are your brother's keeper?
I don't believe "think" quite covers it.
and Jesus is part of this enterprise?
that all right with you?
and he's interested in coming here to this cesspool and salvaging what everybody knows is unsalvageable.
why would he do that? You said he didn't have a lot of free time.
why would he come here?
what would the difference be to him between a building that was spiritually and morally vacant and one that was just plain empty?
mm, Professor, you're a theologian here and I ain't even know it.
you're being facetious.
I don't know that word.
but don't be afraid to talk down to me.
you ain't gonna hurt my feelings.
it means... I guess it means you're not being sincere, that you're being...
you don't mean what you're saying in a cynical sort of way.
mm, you don't think I mean what I say?
I think you say things for effect sometimes.
mm, well, let me say this for effect.
go ahead.
suppose I was to tell you that if you could bring yourself to unlatch your hands from around your brother's throat, you could have life everlasting?
there's no such thing. Everybody dies.
that ain't what he said.
he said you could have life everlasting, have it now, today, hold it in your hands, see it. It gives off a light, got a little weight to it... not much.
warm to the touch just a little...
life, and it's forever.
and you can have it now, today.
but you don't want it.
you don't want it cause to get it you got to let your brother off the hook.
you got to actually take him in your arms and hold him and don't matter what color he is or what he smells like or even if he don't want to be held.
and you won't do it cause you don't think he deserves it.
and about that there ain't no argument.
he don't.
you won't do it 'cause it ain't just.
ain't that so?
ain't it?
I don't think in those terms.
just answer the question, Professor.
I don't believe in that sort of thing.
I know you don't. Just answer the question.
there may be some truth in what you say.
that's all I'm going to get?
Yes.
all right, all right. I'll take it.
some is a lot. We down to breadcrumbs here.
I really have to go home.
no no no, just stay, just a little.
we can talk about something else.
you like baseball?
tell you what... Why don't I fix us something to eat?
I'm not hungry. - How about some coffee?
all right.
but then I really have to go.
all right. The man says all right.
you know, ordinarily I wouldn't be this rude...
a man come in my house, sit at my table and me not offering nothing.
but with you I got to strategize, play the cards right, keep you from slipping off into the night.
it's not night.
depends on what kind of night you're talking about.
let me ask you a kind of personal question.
this will be good.
what you think is wrong with you that you finally narrowed all your choices down to the Sunset Limited?
I don't think there's anything wrong with me.
I think I've just been driven to finally face the truth.
if I'm different it doesn't mean I'm crazy.
different? - Yeah.
different from who? - Anybody.
what about all them other folk out there trying to off themself?
what about them? - Well, maybe they are the folk you is like.
maybe they're your natural kin, only you all don't get together all that much.
I don't think so. - Don't think so?
no, I've been in group therapy with those people.
I've never found anyone there that I felt any kinship with.
hmm, what about all them professors? There ain't no kinship there?
good God. - I'll take that as a no.
I loathe them and they loathe me.
well, just cause you don't like them don't mean you ain't like them.
and what's that word "loathe"?
loathe. - That a pretty powerful word, ain't it?
not powerful enough, I'm afraid.
how come you be loathing these other professors?
I know what you're thinking. - What am I thinking?
you're thinking that I loathe them because I'm like them, and I loathe myself.
let me ask you this...
is you on any kind of medication?
no. - There ain't no medication for pilgrims out there waiting to take the Limited?
for suicidal depression? - Yeah.
Yeah, there is. I've tried them. - And what happened?
nothing happened. - You ain't get no relief?
no. Your coffee's percolated. - Yeah, I know.
does these drugs work for other people?
Yes, for most.
but not for you? - Not for me, no.
hmm, what you make of that?
I don't know. What am I supposed to make of it?
I don't know, Professor. I'm just trying to see if we can find you some constituents out here.
constituents? - Yeah, you like that?
is that a word they use on the streets?
no, I learned that word in the jailhouse.
you hear things from these jailhouse lawyers and then it gets used around.
be talking about your constituents, some other cat's constituents, your wife's constituents.
you take cream and sugar?
no, just black.
just black.
why do I have to have constituents?
I ain't saying you got to, Professor.
I'm just wondering if maybe you do and we just ain't looked hard enough for them.
they could be out there. There could be some other drug-proof terminal commuters out there could be your friends.
terminal commuters? - Mm-hmm, you like the sound of that?
it's all right.
nobody?
nobody, no. - Hmm.
I'm not a member. Never wanted to be and never was.
not a member? - No.
look, I could eat a bite.
and I think you could too.
you break bread with a man, you've moved on to another level of friendship.
I heard that's true the world over.
probably.
probably?
I like probably.
probably from you is worth a couple of damn rights anywhere else.
Why? Because I don't believe in anything?
well, I don't think that's the problem.
I think it's what you do believe that's carrying you off, not what you don't.
let me ask you this.
go ahead.
you ever think about Jesus?
here we go.
well, do you?
what makes you think I'm not Jewish?
what, Jews ain't allowed to think about Jesus?
no, but they might think about him differently.
Oh.
is you Jewish?
no, as it happens I'm not.
had me going there for a minute.
what, you don't like Jews?
I'm just pulling your chain, Professor, just pulling your chain.
I don't know why I like to mess with you, but I do.
now you need to listen or you need to believe what you're hearing, cause the point of where this is going...
which you wanted to know...
is that there ain't no Jews, there ain't no whites, there ain't no niggers... people of color.
there ain't none of that.
at the deep bottom of the mine where the gold is at, there ain't none of that.
there's just the pure ore, that forever thing that you don't think is there, that thing that keeps people nailed down to the platform when the Sunset Limited is coming through, even if they think they want to get aboard, that thing that allows you to ladle out benediction on the heads of strangers instead of curses.
and it's all one thing.
and it ain't but one thing, just one.
and that would be Jesus.
I got to think about how to answer that.
maybe one more heresy won't hurt you.
pretty loaded up on them already.
here's what I would say.
I would say...
Mm!
I would say that thing we're talking about is Jesus, but Jesus as understood as that gold at the bottom of the mine.
he could not come down here and assume the shape of a man if that form was not done shaped to accommodate him.
and if I said ain't no way for Jesus to be every man without every man being Jesus, well now, I think that would be a pretty big heresy.
but that's all right. It ain't as big a heresy as saying like man ain't no different from a rock, which is how I see your point of view.
it's not my point of view. I believe in the primacy of the intellect.
mm, and what's that word?
Primacy? It means first. It means what you put first.
and that would be intellect?
Yes.
well, what about the primacy of the Sunset Limited?
Yes, that too.
but not the primacy of the people waiting on a later train?
no, no primacy there.
hmm.
you tough, Professor.
you tough.
you see yourself as a questioner.
but about that I got my doubts.
the quest of your life is your quest.
and you're on a road that you laid.
and that fact alone might be all the reason you need for sticking to it.
as long as you're on that road you can't get lost.
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.
Oh, I got my doubts about you not understanding anything I say, Professor.
I'm fixing to say grace.
Lord, we thank you for this food and for the many blessings we have received from your hand.
we thank you for the life of the Professor which you have returned to us and ask that you would look after him, cause we need him.
now I don't know why we need him.
I just know we do.
Amen.
tell me how you like this.
it looks good.
this is good.
this is very good.
supposed to be good. It's soul food, my man.
it's got what in it? Molasses?
mm, you a chef, Professor? - Not really.
but some? - Some, yes.
bananas, of course. Mangos?
got a mango or two in it, rutabagas. - Rutabagas?
rutabagas. Them's hard to find.
it's very good.
you know, it gets better after a day or two.
I just fixed this last night.
you gotta heat it up a few times to get the flavors right.
like chili.
like chili. Yeah, that's right.
you know where I learned to fix this?
in Louisiana? - Mm-mm.
right here in the ghettos of New York City.
there's a lot of different influences in a dish like this.
many parts of the world in that pot over yonder, a lot of different countries, different people.
any white people?
not if you can help it.
Really?
I'm just messing with you, Professor, just messing with you.
you know them chefs in them uptown restaurants?
not personally, no. - You know what they like to fix?
no - Sweetbreads...
brains, tripe, all that shit don't nobody like to eat.
you know why that is?
because it's a challenge. You have to innovate.
you're pretty smart for a honky.
that's right. It's a challenge.
the stuff they fix... dead cheap.
most folks throw it out, give it to the cat.
but poor folks... They don't throw nothing out.
I guess that's right.
anybody can make a porterhouse steak taste good.
but if you can't buy no porterhouse steak and you still wants to eat something that tastes good, what do you do then?
innovate. - Innovate. That's right.
and who is it that's got to innovate?
poor people. - That's right. Poor people.
you fixing to get an a+.
so how you like this?
it's very good.
you don't think a glass of wine would have been good with this?
I do think a glass of wine would have been good with it.
but you wouldn't drink it?
Oh, I might. Just one glass.
Jesus drank wine... he and his disciples.
Yes, he did. Says so right here in the Bible.
of course it don't say nothing about him hiding it in the toilet.
is that really a favorite hiding place?
Oh yeah. I've known drunks to lift the lids off toilets in strange places just on the off chance.
is that true? - No.
it could be though. Wouldn't surprise me none.
what is the worst thing you ever did?
more jailhouse stories? - Why not?
which why not you want to hear?
is bludgeoning the man in the prison cafeteria the worst thing you ever did?
no, it ain't.
it isn't? What's the worst?
I ain't gonna tell you. - Why not?
cause you'll jump up, run out the door hollering.
it must be pretty bad.
it is. That's why I ain't telling you.
now I'm afraid to ask. - No, u ain't.
did you ever tell anyone?
Yeah.
it wouldn't leave me alone.
who did you tell it to?
I told it to a man of God who was my friend.
what did he say? - He didn't say a word.
but you're not curious about the worst thing I ever did.
Yeah, I am.
but you won't ask me what it is.
I don't have to. - Why is that?
cause I was there. I seen it.
well, I might have a different view.
Yeah, you might.
you want some more?
no, I'm stuffed.
hungrier than you thought?
Yes, I was.
good.
is this some kind of test of your faith?
what, you? - Me, yes.
it ain't my faith you're testing.
you see everything in black and white.
it is black and white.
I suppose that makes the world easier to understand.
you'd be surprised how little time I spend trying to understand the world.
you try to understand God.
no, I don't.
I try to understand what he wants from me.
and that's everything you need?
if God ain't everything you need, then you in a world of trouble.
I don't make a move without Jesus.
when I get up in the morning,
I try to grab ahold to his belt.
sometime I go into a manual override.
I catch myself.
manual override? - Yeah, you like that?
it's okay. - I thought it was pretty good.
so you come to the end of your rope and you admit defeat and you're in despair.
and in this state you seize upon this, whatever it is, that has neither sense nor substance, and you grab hold of it and hang on for dear life.
is that a fair portrayal?
that might be one way to say it.
it doesn't make any sense.
well, I thought when we was talking earlier you was saying that there was none of it made no sense...
talking about the history of the world and some such.
well, it doesn't on a larger scale.
but what you're telling me is not a view of things.
it's a view of one thing and I find it nonsensical.
what would you do if Jesus was to speak to you?
do you imagine that he might?
no, I don't. But I don't know.
I'm not virtuous enough.
no, Professor, it ain't nothing like that.
you ain't got to be virtuous.
you just has to be quiet.
now I can't speak for the lord, but it has been my experience that he will talk to anybody who will listen.
you damn sure ain't got to be virtuous.
if I heard God talking to me,
I would be ready for you to take me up to Bellevue, as you suggested.
what if what he said made sense?
wouldn't make any difference. Craziness is craziness.
don't make no difference if it makes sense? - No.
well, that's about as big a case of the primacy as I ever heard.
I've always gone my own way.
what's that you talking?
it's German. - You talk German?
not really. A little. It's a quotation.
ah well, it didn't do them Germans much good though, did it?
I don't know. The Germans contributed a great deal to civilization before Hitler.
and then they contributed Hitler.
Yeah, if you like.
I gather it to be your belief that culture tends to contribute to human misery, that the more one knows, the unhappier one is likely to be.
as in the case of certain parties known to us.
as in the case.
well, I don't believe I said that.
I think maybe it was you who said it.
I never said it. - Do you believe it?
no. - No?
I don't know. It could be true.
well, why is that? That don't seem right, do it?
it's the first thing in that book there...
the Garden of Eden, knowledge as destructive to the spirit, destructive to goodness.
I thought you ain't read that book.
everyone knows that story. It's probably the most famous story in there.
hmm, why you think that is?
I suppose from the God's point of view all knowledge is vanity.
or maybe it just gives people the unhealthy illusion that they can outwit the devil.
damn, Professor.
where was you when I needed you?
you'd better be careful. You see where it's gotten me.
Oh, I see. That's the topic of discussion here.
the darker picture is always the correct one.
when you read the history of the world you are reading a saga of bloodshed and greed and folly the import of which is impossible to ignore.
and yet we imagine that the future will somehow be different.
I've no idea why we are even still here.
in all probability we won't be here much longer.
them's some pretty powerful words, Professor.
that's what's in your heart though, ain't it?
Yes.
all right, well, I can relate to them thoughts.
you can? - Sure I can.
that surprises me.
but you could be wrong, you know.
I don't think so.
that ain't something you have a lot of in your life, is it?
what isn't? - Being wrong.
I admit it when I'm wrong. - Oh, I don't know about that.
well, you're entitled to your own opinion.
Oh yeah, here it is.
story on page three.
Ah.
friends reported that the man had ignored all advice and stated that he intended to pursue his own course.
a close confidant stated...
and this here is in quotations...
you couldn't tell that son of a bitch nothing.
now can you say that in the paper...
"son of a bitch"?
blood-spattered spectators at the 155th Street station...
continued on page four...
155th Street station...
who were interviewed at the scene said that the man's last words as he hurtled toward the oncoming commuter train were, 'I am right.'
very funny.
Oh, Professor, you an amazing man.
I'm glad you find me entertaining.
Oh, I think you're pretty special. - I don't think I'm special.
you don't? - No, I don't.
you don't think you view those other commuters from a certain height?
I view those other commuters as fellow occupants of the same abyssal pit in which I find myself.
and if they see it as something different,
I don't know how that makes me special.
Mm.
I hear what you're saying.
but still I keep coming back to these commuters, them that's waiting on the Sunset.
I can't help but think there's got to be something a little special about theirselves.
I mean, they got to be in a deeper pit than us day travelers... deeper and darker.
I ain't saying they down as deep as you, - but pretty deep maybe. - So?
so maybe they your brothers in self-destruction and despair.
I thought misery loved company.
I'm sure I don't know.
let me take a shot at it.
what I think is that you got better reasons than them.
see, their reasons is that they just don't like it here, but yours says what it is not to like and why not not to like it.
you got more intelligent reasons, more elegant reasons.
you making fun of me? - No, I ain't.
but you think I'm full of shit? - No, I don't think that.
but I don't doubt that it's possible to die from being full of shit.
but I don't think that's what we're looking at here.
what do you think we're looking at?
I don't know. You got me in uncharted territory.
you got these world-class reasons for taking the Limited where these other dudes... all they got is, well, maybe they just don't feel good.
it might could be that you ain't even all that unhappy.
you think my education is driving me to suicide?
no, I'm just posing the question.
well, wait a minute for your answer.
okay, go ahead.
I think that's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard.
I think that's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard.
very clever. What's the point?
the light is all around you but you don't see nothing but shadow.
and you're the one causing it.
it's you. You're the shadow.
that's the point.
well, I don't have your faith.
why don't we just leave it at that?
you ain't never thought about just starting over?
I did at one time. I don't anymore.
well, maybe faith is just a case of not having nothing else left.
well, I do have something else.
well, why don't you just keep that in reserve?
just take a shot at starting over.
I don't mean starting again. Everybody's done that.
over means over. Just walk away.
I mean, if everything you are and everything you have and everything you done has brought you at last to the bottom of a whisky bottle or bought you a one-way ticket on the Sunset Limited, you can't give me one good reason on God's green earth for salvaging none of it, cause there ain't none.
if you can bring yourself to close the door on all of that, it will be cold and it will be lonely and there will be a fierce wind blowing.
but you don't say nothing.
you just turn your collar up and keep walking.
I can't. I can't.
you want some more coffee?
no, thank you.
why do you think it is folks take their own life?
I don't know. Different reasons.
is there anything these different reasons has got in common?
I can't speak for others.
my own reasons center around a gradual loss of make-believe, a gradual enlightenment as to the nature of reality, of the world.
them worldly reasons. - If you like.
them elegant reasons. - That was your description.
you ain't disagreed with it.
it's them reasons that your brother don't know nothing about hanging from his necktie from a steampipe down in the basement.
he's got his own dumbass reasons.
but if we could find a way to educate him to them more elegant reasons and make them available to him and his buddies, then there'd be a lot of folk out there could off themselves with more joy in their hearts. What you think?
now I know you're being facetious.
I think you're right. I think you done finally drove me to it.
Mm-hmm.
professor done gone to laying mm-hmms on me.
I guess I'd better watch my step.
you better had. I might be warming up the trick bag.
you think your reasons is about the world, and his is mostly about him.
I think that's probably true.
I think I see a different truth sitting across the table from me.
which is?
that you must love your brother or die.
I don't know what that means.
it's another world from anything I know.
well, well, tell me how your world is.
you don't want to hr it.
sure I do. - I don't think so.
Yeah, go ahead.
all right.
it's that the world is basically a forced labor camp from which the workers, perfectly innocent, are led forth by lottery, a few each day, to be executed.
I don't think that's just the way I see it.
I think that's the way it is.
are there alternative views? Yes.
will any of them stand close scrutiny?
no.
so do you want to take a look at that train schedule again?
if this ain't the life you wanted, what was?
I don't know. Not this.
are you living the life you had planned?
no, it ain't.
but I got what I needed instead of what I wanted.
sometimes that's the best kind of luck to have.
Yeah, well...
you can't compare your life to mine though, can you?
no, I can't.
I just can't.
Oh, I'm sorry. I should go.
you don't have to go. - I've offended you.
look, my hide is thicker than that.
don't go. You ain't hurt my feelings.
I know you think I should be thankful. I'm sorry not to be.
I don't think no such thing. - I should go.
I'm digging a dry hole here, ain't I?
I admire your persistence.
what can I do to get you to just stay just a bit?
Why? Are you hoping that if I stay long enough, God might talk to me?
no, I'm hoping he'll speak to me.
I know you think I at least owe you a little more of my time.
I know I'm ungrateful.
but ingratitude is not the sin to a spiritual bankrupt that it is to a man of God.
I don't think you owe me nothing, Professor.
you really think that? - Yeah, I do.
well, you're very kind. And I wish there was something I could do to repay you, but there isn't.
so why don't we just say goodbye? You can get on with your life.
suppose...
suppose I have to tell you you could wake up tomorrow and you wouldn't want to be jumping in front of no train.
suppose all you had to do was ask. Would you do it?
that just depends on what I would have to give up.
see, I started to write that down on a piece of paper.
what is it you think I'm holding on to?
I don't know!
what is it the terminal commuter cherishes - that he would die for? - I don't know.
no no.
you don't.
you don't want to talk to me no more, do you?
I thought you had a thick skin.
it is, but it ain't hide to the bone.
why do you think there is something that I won't give up?
I don't know.
I think any man anxious to get run over by a train has got to have something on his mind.
I mean most of us would just settle for maybe a slap upside the head.
you say you don't care about nothing, but I don't believe that.
I don't think death is ever about nothing.
you asked me what I think you're holding on to and I got to say I don't know.
or maybe I just don't have the words to say it.
and maybe you know but you just ain't telling.
what I believe is that when you took your celebrated leap, you was taking it with you and you was holding on to it, holding on for grim death.
I'm just looking for the words, Professor.
I'm looking for the words cause I know the words is just the way to your heart.
well, I can't help you.
letting it all go is the place I finally got to.
it took a lot of work to get there. And if there's one thing
I would be unwilling to give up, it is exactly that.
is there another way you could say that?
the one thing I won't give up is giving up.
I expect that to carry me through.
I'm depending on it.
the things I believe in were very frail, as I've said.
they won't be around very long and neither will I.
but I don't think that's really the reason for my decision.
I think it goes deeper than that.
you can acclimate yourself to loss.
you have to. I mean...
you like music, right?
yeah yeah, I do.
who is the greatest composer that you know of?
John Coltrane, hands down.
do you think his work will last forever?
well, forever's a long time, Professor.
so I got to say no.
that doesn't mean it's worthless, does it?
no, it don't.
you give up the world line by line.
you become an accomplice to your own annihilation.
there's nothing you can do about it.
everything you do closes a door somewhere ahead of you.
finally there's only one door left.
that's a dark world, Professor.
maybe you just need to admit that you're in over your head.
I do admit it, but that don't let me off the hook.
I got no choice.
okay.
maybe you're right.
well, here is my news, reverend.
I long for the darkness.
I pray for death, real death.
and if I thought that in death I would meet the people I knew in life,
I don't know what I would do. That would be the ultimate horror, the ultimate nightmare. If I thought I was gonna meet my mother again and start all of that all over, only this time without the prospect of death to look forward to, that would be the final nightmare,
kafka on wheels.
damn, Professor. You don't want to see your own mama?
no, I don't.
I want the dead to be dead forever.
and I want to be one of them.
except of course you can't be one of them. You can't be one of the dead because that which has no existence can have no community.
no community.
my heart warms just thinking about it...
blackness, aloneness, silence, peace, and all of it only a heartbeat away.
I don't regard my state of mind as some pessimistic view of the world.
I regard it as the world itself.
evolution cannot avoid bringing intelligent life ultimately to an awareness of one thing, and one thing above all else.
and that one thing is futility.
if I'm understanding you right, you're saying everybody that just ain't eat up with the dumbass ought to be suicidal.
Yes. - You ain't shitting me?
no, I am not shitting you.
if people could see the world for what it truly is, see their lives for what they truly are, without dreams or illusions,
I don't believe they could offer the first reason why they should not elect to die as soon as possible.
I don't believe in God. Can you understand that?
look around you, man. Can't you see?
the clamor and din of those in torment has to be the sound most pleasing to his ear.
and I loathe these discussions...
the argument of the village atheist whose single passion is to revile endlessly that which he denies the existence of in the first place.
your fellowship is a fellowship of pain and nothing more.
and if that pain were collective instead of merely reiterative, the sheer weight of it would drag the world from the walls of the universe and send it crashing and burning down through whatever night it might yet be capable of engendering until it was not even ash.
and brotherhood, justice, eternal life?
good God, man.
show me a religion that prepares one for nothingness, for death.
that's a church I might enter.
yours prepares one only for more life, for dreams and illusions and lies.
banish the fear of death from men's hearts...
they wouldn't live a day.
who would want this nightmare but for fear of the next?
the shadow of the axe hangs over every joy
every road ends in death, every friendship, every love.
torment, loss, betrayal, pain, suffering, age, indignity, hideous lingering illness...
and all of it with a single conclusion for you and every one and every thing you have ever chosen to care for.
that is the true brotherhood, the true fellowship.
and everybody is a member for life.
you tell me that my brother is my salvation?
my salvation?
well, then damn him.
damn him in every shape and guise and form.
do I see myself in him? Yes, I do.
and what I see sickens me.
do you understand me?
can you understand me?
I'm sorry.
how long you felt like this?
all my life.
is that true? - It's worse than that.
I don't see what could be worse than that.
rage is really only for the good days.
the truth is there's little of that left.
the truth is that the forms I see have been slowly emptied out.
they no longer have any content.
they're shapes only... a train, a wall, a world, a man...
a thing dangling in senseless articulation in a howling void, no meaning to its life, its words.
why would I seek out the company of such a thing?
Why?
damn.
so you see what it is you've saved?
tried to save. Still trying, trying hard.
who is your brother? - Who is my brother, yes.
is that the reason I'm here in your apartment?
no, that's why I'm here.
you asked me what I'm a Professor of.
I am a Professor of darkness, the night in day's clothing.
and now I wish you all the very best, but I must go.
just stay a little while longer.
no, no more time. Goodbye.
we can talk about something else, I swear.
I don't want to talk about something else.
don't go out there, Professor! You know what's out there!
Oh yes. Indeed I do.
I know what's out there and I know who is out there.
I rush to nuzzle his bony cheek.
no doubt he will be surprised to find himself so cherished.
and as I cling to his neck
I will whisper in that dry and ancient ear, "Here I am. Here I am."
now open the door! - Don't do this.
you're a kind man. I've heard you out and you've heard me. There's no more to say.
your God must once have stood at a dawn of infinite possibilities, and that is what he's made of it.
you tell me that I want God's love. I don't.
perhaps I want forgiveness, but there is no one to ask it of.
and there's no going back. There's no setting things right.
there's only the hope of nothingness.
and I cling to that hope.
now open the door. - Don't do this.
please open the door.
thank you. Goodbye.
professor,
I know you ain't mean them words.
I'm gonna be there in the morning.
I'm gonna be there, you hear?
I'm gonna be there!
I'm gonna be there.
you know he didn't mean them words.
you know he didn't.
you know he didn't.
I don't understand why you sent me down there.
I don't understand.
if you wanted me to help him, then how come you didn't give me the words?
you give them to him. What about me?
that's all right. That's all right.
if you don't never speak again, you know I'll keep your word.
you know I will. You know I'm good for it.
is that okay?
is that okay?
consider outer space.
from the time of the first NASA mission, it became evident...
that being in space has a profound effect on the human psyche.
during the first Gemini mission, some thought was actually given...
to the notion of sending up a man and a woman together.
Really?
a cosmic Adam and Eve, if you will...
bound together in a sophisticated nerve center...
at the head of the largest, most powerful known rocket...
its giant thrusters blasting into the dark void...
as they hurtled towards their final destination:
the gushing wellspring of life itself.
how would you like a sexual encounter so intense...
it could conceivably change your political views?
would you like to dance? -Yes, please.
l'll take that as a no.
consider outer space. -What?
private Gibson! lncoming!
what is this? " Lonely man sitting on a hill " ?
lt's over, Lance.
lt's gone, l've lost it.
high school.
l started off so hot. Sophomore year, two times.
junior year was excellent. Four times.
and not all with the same girl.
senior year looked like the best. The first day of classes, then nothing.
what do you mean, nothing your senior year?
what about that time with Barbara DeVillebis in the high-jump pit?
that was you.
l just can't motivate myself the way l used to.
maybe l'm past my prime.
lt's not you. lt's these high school girls, here.
they're simple.
they're never gonna stimulate a complex guy like you.
maybe you're right. - Of course l'm right.
anyways...
after tonight, you'll never have to deal with these simple high school girls again.
but won't these same girls be in college? -Yeah, but it'll be different.
Why? -Because they'll be college girls.
l'm gonna miss you.
lt's your own fault. You could be coming out to California with me.
Yeah, right.
get a totally bitchin' education out there, dude.
California.
you could be coming to New England with me.
what are you, crazy? The lvy League stinks.
they've only got those ugly, intellectual girls...
with Band-Aids on their knees from playing the cello. No, thank you.
l'm really gonna miss you.
we're college men now.
dear Lance, the campus here is beautiful.
I've never seen so much corduroy in one place.
classes are classes.
one of them even looks like it might be interesting.
you never know.
you're wrong about the women here.I haven't seen one Band-Aid.
in fact, there's plenty of action.
my roommate andI have an understanding.
hope things are going as good for you. Your pal, Gib.
P. S. All of the above is bullshit.
I'm floundering in a sea of confusion and total despair.
but, knock on wood, I still have my health.
this week's assignment is to rewrite last week's assignment.
remember, " As the dog returneth to his own vomit...
'so does the fool to his folly. "
sorry l'm late, but there was this big problem...
and l'm late because of it.
Katherine, when l told you that you should develop your own style...
l didn't mean that you should dot the i's with little flowers.
and this lavender ink... Would you lose that?
lt strains the eye.
you sure take a lot of notes.
miss Duran, this is very interesting.
ordinarily, the conclusion comes in the end of the paper, but...
l like that. -Thank you.
go on.
Mr. Gibson? -Yes, what?
l know what an important part voyeurism plays in your daily life...
but would you mind if l take up a moment of your time?
sure. -Thank you.
see, l want to tell you...
that l really enjoyed your paper.
you did? -Yeah.
l don't remember the last time...
that l have seen this much detail expressed on:
'how to eat pizza without burning the roof of your mouth. "
unfortunately, whatever whimsical qualities that your paper evokes...
are obscured in a morass of marginal grammar...
creative spelling...
and, as l believe, sausage stain.
pepperoni.
clean it up.
ms. Bradbury.
you, on the other hand...
express your ideas very clearly.
thank you.
except that your paper is...
well, it's dry.
there's not enough of you coming through.
loosen up, Alison. Have some fun.
sleep when you feel like it, not when you think you should.
eat food that is bad for you, at least once in a while.
have conversations with people whose clothes are not color coordinated.
make love in a hammock!
life is the ultimate experience.
you have to experience it...
in order to write about it.
Yes, Alison. -What did you say after " hammock " ?
l want you. -All right.
you're a dead man, dead meat. You'll hear footsteps.
set!
Gibson, all-pro safety out of Grambling, makes another sparkling defensive jam.
l thought Grambling was all black. -So what?
what are you doing tonight?
l'll tell you, l am not rewriting my English paper. l have a social life.
that's right, l forgot. You've got to go to a mixer.
stand in the corner for three hours, and not ask anyone to dance.
lt's the girls at this school.
all they want is to stay indoors, smoke cigarettes and relate. l don't like them.
why do you have to like them?
you're dead meat.
what does Taub mean, l have to live life?
ln high school, l was delegate to the mock UN in New York City.
twice.
when l was nine, l broke my brother's nose, boxing.
on a tour of Graceland, l passed out in Elvis' bedroom.
l think l've done my share of living, haven't l?
what do you think of that guy Gib? -l don't.
l think he's got a cute ass.
him? -Yeah.
Gibson, with the interception! And he's got some running room!
he's to the 30, to the 40...
and he's run out of bounds at midfield by Jimbo Maccavechi!
that's Gibson's 9th interception of this very young season.
he's having an outstanding year.
'Life's the ultimate experience. "
forget it. She likes the intellectual type.
l'm intellectual, and stuff.
you're flunking English. That's your mother tongue, and stuff.
the only way she'd go out with you is out of pity.
Mastin, you're a genius. -Stop and go, on 1 .
break!
both y'all are dead. -Ready down. Set.
hut one. Hut two. Hut three. -Watch it, now.
nice D. -Go!
nice.
where are you going? -Come on!
the ball!
l'm flunking English. l was wondering if maybe you could help me out.
nice swimsuit.
lf l flunk English, l'm out of here.
kiss college goodbye.
l don't know what l'll do.
l'll probably go home.
gee, Dad will be pissed off. Mom will be heartbroken.
lf l play my cards right, l get maybe a six-month's grace period...
and then l got to get a job, and you know what that means.
that's right. They start me off at the drive-up window...
and l work my way up from shakes to burgers...
and then, one day, my lucky break comes.
the French fry guy dies, and they offer me the job.
but the day l have to start, some men come in a black Lincoln Continental...
and tell me l can make a quick $300 just for driving a van back from Mexico.
when l get out of jail, l'm 36 years old...
living in a flophouse. No job...
no home, no upward mobility, very few teeth.
then one day they find me, face down...
talking to the gutter, clutching a bottle of paint thinner. And why?
because you wouldn't help me in English. No!
you were too busy to help me!
too busy to help a drowning man!
okay.
okay, what? -Okay, l'll help you.
you will?
when?
how about tonight?
let's see. Friday.
5: 30, dinner. 6: 00, calculus.
7: 00, news. 7: 30, shower.
7: 45, phone call. 8: 00?
8: 00, l don't know. That's when l rearrange my sock drawer.
do you want me to help you, or not? -l do.
l was just kidding, there.
1899/12/31 0: 08: 00
see you then.
where? -McKenzie Hall.
great!
lt's Friday night!
'l'm a freshman at a small Northeastern college.
'l never thought those letters were true, until a few days ago...
'l had an experience that changed my mind.
'l just had to share it with you.
'l had resigned myself to another night of reading your magazine...
'when there was a knock on my dorm room door.
'and when l opened the door, l could hardly believe my eyes.
'there were two of the foxiest twins l had ever seen...
'with long brunette hair, legs that wouldn't quit...
'and firm tits. "
how does that sound?
change " tits " to " generous scoops of mouthwatering flesh. "
and have them defy gravity.
ls this shirt good?
Yeah. You think they'll know that " scoops of flesh " means " tits " ?
l don't think it sounds specific enough.
where else are you gonna find scoops of flesh?
how's this for an opening line:
'did you know that Nietzsche died of syphilis? "
how do you spell " zucchini " ? -Z-u-c-h-i-n-i.
nietzsche's too obscure.
how about, " Did you know that Shakespeare died of syphilis? "
she probably knows it isn't true. l don't know what to say.
lt's not what you say that counts, but how you say it.
use sincerity. lt's the best technique. -What?
come here.
you know, l've never met anyone like you before.
usually, when l meet someone new, l feel awkward and shy.
but with you, it's different.
l can talk to you.
you know what l'm thinking, without my having to explain it to you in fancy terms.
l love you.
that is the most enormous pile of horseshit l've ever heard in my life.
get out of here, you piece of slime. -No chick would ever buy it.
that's where you're wrong. lt's how l got Lucy.
lt's horseshit. -Effective horseshit.
get a life.
lt's true.
lt's open.
l'm so far behind, l haven't even picked out a theme for my English Lit term paper.
of course l'm still coming out there for Christmas.
you think l'm gonna leave you alone with all those UCLA girls?
l just can't afford to fly. My parents will only pay if l go to see them.
don't worry. l'll figure something out.
they have this bulletin board where they list rides.
l really want to see you.
l will send you the article on civil liability, l promise.
do you ever eat food that you think is bad for you?
l didn't think so. lt's not important.
you tell me first.
l love you, too.
Bye.
who's that, your lawyer? -Someday.
ready? -Yeah.
'when l recollect my most truly excellent experience...
'recurrent images buzz through my brain:
'the big bubbles of crust that expand right up through the sauce...
'glistening pools of oil as still and inviting as a mountain...
'lake...
the ropy knots of cheese that gather to a chewy perfection in the center as the slices are pulled apart."
lt's good. -This is all wrong.
there's no punctuation. lt's all one sentence.
so? -lt's a mess.
you neglected to mention the most important thing.
l talk about the cheese-to-sauce ratio right there.
you didn't state your topic, that this is gonna be a paper on pizza.
but that is completely inferred.
lmplied. -Whatever.
look, what do you say we blow this off and go exploring?
nothing gets done on a Friday night. Come on.
where are you going?
lt's too stuffy, let's go get some air.
you can't go in there. -l can.
this is America, you can go anywhere.
we're not supposed to be up here. - See that?
that's Ursa Major, the Big Bear.
we could get into trouble. - That's Ursa Minor, the Little Bear.
up to the north there, that's Cassiopeia.
that's Cassiopeia?
she was the mother of Andromeda, right? - Who?
Cassiopeia. - Really? l just know the names.
Andromeda's there, too, next to Cassiopeia.
Andromeda. She was the princess who was chained to a rock.
she was to be sacrificed to a sea serpent.
did he get her? - No.
Perseus rescued her at the last minute. - Perseus, good man.
he's up there, too, next to Andromeda.
you know a lot about astronomy. - Yeah.
when l was six, l wanted to be an astronaut.
you know, all the Tang you can drink.
you'll never believe what l wanted to be when l was six.
a classics professor. - No.
l wanted to be a princess.
you know, Alison, l never met anyone like you before.
usually, when l meet someone new, l feel awkward and shy.
but with you it's different. l feel l can talk to you.
you know what l'm thinking, without me having to explain it to you in fancy terms.
we speak each other's unspoken language...
what? -...fluently.
l love you.
what?
did l hurt you? -No.
l'm sorry!
you're not. You had this whole thing planned.
excellent.
what? -Don't you have an 8: 00?
what time is it? -7: 51 .
shit!
Oh, God!
wait up.
l feel really terrible about Friday night.
l was rude, insensitive, selfish...
asshole. - Exactly.
but that wasn't me.
l don't know why l said those things, l'm really not like that. Please.
l'm really sorry.
can you forgive me?
please.
come on, we're gonna be late for class.
'he was a man, that's all.
'a man like any other man.
'a man like no other man. "
that's very interesting, Marsha. - Thanks.
you have a feel for ambiguity.
anyone else want to volunteer?
me? -Give me your paper.
here you go.
no pepperoni today? - lt's clean.
'l am a freshman at a small Northeastern college.
'l never thought these letters were real...
'until a few days ago, when l had an experience that changed my mind.
'l just had to share it with you. "
miss Taub, l don't think that you-- -Take it easy.
'l am 6'2 " , with dark hair...
'athletic build from football, and l'm considered good-looking by my friends.
'l'm not boastful, but l must explain...
'for the sake of clarity, that l am relatively well equipped...
'with 10 inches of solid man-meat.
'Still, it has been a dry season as far as girls were concerned. "
l'll get it.
lt's for you, Gib. Long distance. -Thanks.
l'm coming.
buddy, you getting any?
l'm talking to you cordless. What are you doing for Christmas break?
l do. You're coming to California.
what don't you know?
my roommate's got a convertible. We cruise to Palm Springs.
l got exams after Christmas.
we are talking SoCal, here. lt's 80 degrees outside.
my roommate's got this beach house in Malibu.
l can't afford the flight.
listen. Can you hear that?
hear that? Those are waves calling out to you.
they're beckoning.
come to California. " - lt's too sunny out there.
there's a certain someone l want you to meet.
forget it.
she's a very special person.
l can't deal with striking out on both coasts.
you're not gonna strike out.
she was released from parochial school. She's in her experimental phase.
will you forget it?
she loves sex. -What does she look like?
you remember that last snapshot l sent you?
the blonde in the string bikini? Get it.
l can't right now. -That's an order, Private Gibson.
excuse me.
that's new.
Yeah. -You got it?
Yeah. -Good. Now look at it.
fixate on it.
are you fixating on it? -l'm fixating.
are you sitting down? -Yes.
she's a sure thing.
a sure thing.
I don't need to explain the deep significance of those words.
I told her all about you, and she's dying to meet you.
but you gotta drag your ass out here by the 22nd...
because she's leaving the next day for a semester at sea.
so, think you can make it?
are you Gib? - Yeah.
Hi, welcome aboard.
l'm Mary Ann Webster. - And l'm Gary Cooper.
but not the Gary Cooper that's dead.
hop in.
Alison, this is Gib. -And Gib, this is Alison.
l knew l should've taken the bus.
what, and wind up sitting next to some sleazebag?
some sleazebag you don't know?
you two know each other. - We're old friends.
we're not old friends. We're acquaintances.
very distant acquaintances.
kids, come on. Let's make this a fun trip, okay?
you guys know any show tunes? - That's a great idea.
when the moon is in the Seventh House
and Jupiter aligns with Mars
then peace will guide the planets
and love will steer the stars
this is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
the age of Aquarius!

take good care of yourself you belong to me!

be careful crossing streets
don't eat meats
cut out sweets
you'll get a pain and ruin your tum-tum I never met anyone like you before. Usually, when I meet someone new...
l feel awkward and shy.
but with you it's different.
l feel l can talk to you.
you know what l'm thinking, without me having to explain it to you in fancy terms.
we speak each other's unspoken language fluently.
before you go any further, let's be honest.
you want it. l want it.
you know l want it. You don't have to bullshit me to get it.
and even if you do bullshit me, you still get it.
wear your flannel underwear when you climb a tree
take good care of yourself, you belong to me
honey, what's the matter? You're not singing.
l'm not gonna sing if they're not gonna join in.
come on, honey -- No, they're ruining it for everyone.
what do you think you're doing?
l'm going to bed. -Not with me, you're not.
l'm not going to bed with you.
l'm going to bed in a bed that you happen to be in, also.
l won't try anything, l swear.
trust me.
you are sleeping on the floor. l worked out a schedule.
lt's not my schedule. - lt's both of ours.
they never shut up. What does she see in him?
lt's a twisted relationship.
you want to sleep in the bed? - l do.
fine, l'll sleep on the floor.
you don't have to sleep on the floor.
do you intend to sleep in the bed? -l do.
then l intend to sleep on the floor.
good night.
great breakfast. -Protein, good for you.
cheese balls, anyone? Gary? They're good.
cheese balls? -No, thank you.
you would think that was funny.
as a matter of fact, l think that's hysterical.
l think it's a scream. An absolute laugh riot.
what the hell's the matter with it? - lt's stupid.
everything's stupid with you.
all right. lt is stupid. What's wrong with being stupid once in a while?
does everything you do always have to be sensible?
Gary, they're at it again.
haven't you ever thrown water balloons off the roof?
didn't you ever sprinkle lvory Flakes on the floor...
because you wanted it to snow in July?
didn't you ever get really shitfaced, and make a complete fool out of yourself...
and still have an excellent time?
Gary, do something.
don't you feel great when you do something totally spontaneous?
something totally off the wall?
spontaneity has its time and its place.
Alison, do you know what you are?
you're repressed. - l'm not repressed.
you are.
l can be as spontaneous as anyone. - Prove it.
what do you want me to do?
l don't have to prove anything to you. - You can't. You're repressed.
you don't have to be stupid to be spontaneous.
repressed. - ls that spontaneous?
sticking your butt out of a car? - Repressed!
face it, you're repressed.
you want spontaneity?
l'll give you spontaneity! - Repressed!
l'll give you... Watch this!

lock the doors. - Let's be reasonable, Gary!
you can't do this! You can't leave us here!
you can't. Gary, please!
l'm pleading. - Lock the doors!
l'll do anything!
l'll sing show tunes!
feelings, nothing more than feelings
trying to forget my feelings
feelings of love!
they'll be back.
just a little mad.
there's a town up ahead. l saw a sign. We can hitch.
where you going?
we're in the middle of nowhere, cold, there's no cars! You stay and hitch.
you gonna walk? lt's almost 20 miles. - And don't follow me!
fried pork rinds, anyone?
this doesn't change anything, okay?
suit yourself.
you know, junk food really doesn't deserve the bad rap it gets.
take these fried pork rinds.
this particular brand has one percent of the RDA...
that's " recommended daily allowance, " of riboflavin.
you ever noticed there's three kinds of junk food?
there's your starchy, fried, greasy type
listen, l appreciate the food. But l'm not in the mood...
to listen to any more of your scientific observations.
you didn't have to come over here and sit down.
you're right. l didn't.
want a ride?
l wouldn't take that ride, if l were you.
you're not me.
Hello!
how far are you going? - Los Angeles.
Los Angeles is a long way for a little girl like you to be going.
this thing's like an old woman. You've got to kick her to get her in gear.
l got up at 6: 00 this morning, and l've been driving ever since.
you're the first person l've talked to all day.
wish l could say that.
l hope he gets a ride, but some people just don't know when to put a lid on it.
a day like this, you get to thinking you're the only person on Earth.
lt gets lonely on the road.
l know. l can't wait to get to California to see my boyfriend.
l got my CB. But that's not real talk.
lt's not a real person, just a voice. -Let's see if l...
you never get to know what they look like, or who they are.
...By Thursday night, or Friday morning at the latest.
you look nice.
why are we stopping here?
what are we doing?
lt gets lonely on the road.
don't touch me! - Don't be scared.
l wouldn't hurt you. - Don't!
thanks for the ride. l've been out here all day.
am l interrupting anything?
me and the wife are just having a little squabble.
lt's not easy getting rides, you know?
most people are afraid to pick up hitchhikers.
you never know who you might pick up.
l mean, l could be some crazed slimeball.
l mean, a real deranged, violent psycho. You know what l mean?
l mean, a guy who would rip your heart out...
and eat it, just for pleasure!
l'm talking about a total maniac!
do you know what l mean?
why aren't we moving?
don't you want to give me a ride?
l'm only going about another mile. - Then what the hell did you pick me up for?
you think l got nothing better to do with my life...
than to sit here and to pass the time with you?
Shitbrain!
l don't think l want this ride after all.
and l think l'll take your wife, if you don't mind.
shit. - The luggage!
Gib, are you okay?
told you you shouldn't have taken that ride.
that's because you know everything, right? -That's right.
then you should also know that you make it virtually impossible...
for anyone to be grateful for anything nice you might have done.
l'm sorry, okay?
Yeah. - You okay?
why did you get on the back of that truck?
because l'm the kind of guy that likes to live on the edge.
l just want to get on that bus, and tilt the seat back...
and fall asleep, and wake up in California.
check out those guys. Wonder what they majored in.
where to? - Los Angeles.
that'll be $89. 50.
bus number 33, now boarding outside. -Thank you.
where to? -Nowhere. Just browsing.
tell me, those guys over there? Do they sleep here all night?
come on, l want to get a good seat.
where to?
Where's your ticket?
l've been thinking it over. l'm gonna hitch.
the way l see it, l'm not getting any younger.
this could be my last chance to see the real America, really relate to the people.
loan me $1 .
change a $5?
how much money do you have? -That's $1 .
l got money. - That's $2.
how much? - Enough.
can you loan me $1 . 23? - Sure.
how much do you got there?
how did you expect to get to California on $18. 77?
l'll get by.
l have $20. You can have $50.
l can't take that. - You can. Come on.
you can pay me back after Christmas. Take it.
l won't forget this. - You will. But l'll remind you.
last call for bus number 33, leaving for St. Louis...
Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Albuquerque, Tucson and Los Angeles.
there's your bus. You better hurry.
are you sure you'll be okay?
don't you worry about me. You go have a good trip.
see you. -' Bye.
back. Give Hercules some room.
Hercules stands no chance against the sea monster.
anything good on?
your bus just left. - l know.
why weren't you on it?
l'm the kind of gal who likes to live on the edge.
we're gonna have to use a towel, here.
this could get very messy, if you don't know what you're doing.
this is called shotgunning beer.
lt's an ancient tribal custom. Originated in Southeast Asia, l believe.
take the beer. Poke a hole in it, as l will do now...
using any household appliance. l'm using a pen.
make it just big enough to fit your mouth over it.
eighty-six the pen, and then in one swift...
now listen to me, it's very important.
ln one swift, deft motion, you're gonna take it...
pull it up, and then release the cork. Not the cork, this thing...
and all the beer will slide down to your throat in two seconds.
now wait. Are you sure you're ready? -l'm ready.
for all you kids watching, this is very dangerous.
let's not try this at home, all right?
sure you're ready? - l can't believe l'm doing this.
lt's good for you. - Mom, forgive me.
swallow, swallow!
'Danger, Will Robinson! "
definite shotgun potential. - But it went up my nose.
for a beginner, it's amazing what you just did.
really nice.
Really?
l just remembered, l got to check something.
listen, tonight l'll sleep on the floor.
l don't think so. - l don't want any arguments from you.
l mean, it's only fair. Last night, l slept on the bed.
Jason, l don't think so. lt's gonna take me a bit longer than l anticipated.
today's the 19th. Better not expect me...
till the 22nd or 23rd, at the earliest.
everything's fine. Really.
l'll call you tomorrow.
promise.
l miss you, Jason.
l've got this great big bed, and no one to share it with.
what are you doing? - l'm going for a walk.
lt's almost midnight. - lt's too stuffy in here.
l'm here.
are you 21?
okay, Dr. Levinson, what'll it be?
double bourbon and a beer chaser.
come on, Giblet, one more time.
l can't. Tomorrow, l promise.
lt was so good.
lt was so masterful. Relentless...
but with a delicate touch.
confident. Creative.
l was overwhelmed.
you're a true artist.
just let me sleep awhile, regain my strength.
five minutes. A grace period, if you will.
please.
what the heck.
Howdy.
mind if l sit here? - Sure, buddy, go ahead.
thank you kindly.
two beers. - And another double bourbon.
l got one of them sweepstakes flyers in the mail today...
and l can't figure if it's worth the effort to send it in.
you think l should bother?
probably not.
she says she's from Paris.
l don't believe that.
Paris women...
don't give you a hard time, like they do here.
to a Paris woman, sex is an art.
l was in Paris once, with my wife.
boy, am l glad she's dead.
one tequila eggnog.
l had fried food again for lunch today.
l know l shouldn't have had it...
but l couldn't help myself.
you think l lack self-discipline?
what's wrong with me? l'm a good-looking guy.
you are a good-looking guy.
and l'm a good-looking guy.
you are. - l am.
we're all three good-looking guys.
that's right. We are.
and it's Christmastime, and l'm gonna buy you a drink.
what are you drinking? - Something light.
what, like a nice Chablis? - A spritzer.
barkeep, give this man a trough of spritzer.
and you, cowboy guy, what do you want to drink?
l'll have a beer. - Get cowboy guy a beer.
lt's on me tonight. Drinks are on me.
they're on me.
chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir and folks dressed up like Eskimos
everybody knows that turkey and some mistletoe
Where've you been?
this guy, Jason...
may be a real brain and all, but can he do this?
don't worry, Mom, l'll take the garbage out in the morning, l promise.
chestnuts roasting on the fire
come on, let's go.
okay, do you have everything? - l have everything. You have everything.
sure? - We all have everything. Everything's fine.
let's go. - You can't rush me.
she's checking under the thing. What is under there, l don't know.
a bathroom. Again with the bathroom. - You can't rush me!
we've got to travel by day. So let's go.
look at the time. We got to go. - We're all proceeding, here.
just check everything. - We got everything, here.
we're out of here.
God, l'm starving.
how does it feel? - Needs more bulk.
we can't eat for 200 miles.
what are you telling me, woman?
l worked out a schedule. - Another schedule. Great.
l computed exactly how much money we have...
how long it'll take us to get there, how many meals we have to have.
lt came out to one meal every 200 miles.
after 700, though, we can have a snack.
good. Cheetos in Albuquerque. l can hardly wait.
what do you think, nine months? - More like 15.
excellent. Very pregnant.
what are you gonna name it? - What?
the baby.
the baby.
lf it's a girl, Cynthia.
and if it's a boy...
those are lovely names.
Elliot? You're gonna name the kid Elliot?
you can't name the kid Elliot.
Elliot is a fat kid with glasses who eats paste.
not gonna name the kid Elliot. Got to give him a real name.
give him a name.
like Nick. - Nick?
Nick's a real name. Nick's your buddy.
Nick's the kind of guy you can trust, someone you can drink beer with.
kind of guy who doesn't mind if you puke in his car.
God. - Vomit, l'm sorry.
thank you. - Merry Christmas to you.
l'm gonna have a huge orange juice, three eggs, two sides of bacon...
home fries, four pieces of toast, and then lunch!
you sure we can eat? l don't know if we've gone 200 miles.
l don't want to throw your schedule off.
leave me alone. l'm a pregnant woman.
how could you lose your money?
l put it in my schedule book. - How could you lose your schedule book?
that's the most important thing in your life, that stupid book!
you wouldn't even remember your name without it. This is just excellent!
l'm starving.
thank you.
l'm freezing to death.
my feet are killing me.
l just swallowed my gum.
your incessant complaining isn't doing us any good.
can't you try and look on the bright side?
over there!
over there. There's a trailer, come on.
lt's locked! This is very good.
lt's important that this place should have an airtight security system...
in the middle of nowhere!
wait, l might have a nail file.
l have a credit card.
credit cards work on a completely different kind of lock.
l don't think you understand. l have a credit card.
you have a credit card?
my dad told me, specifically, l can only use it in case of an emergency.
maybe one will come up.
too bad this is the only place that takes credit cards.
real shame.
here, try some of my veal.
only if you try some of this salmon.
l'm not a big fish guy, so you take it.
l'm not gonna eat that, but you try the veal
l'm not gonna-- - Try it.
lt's good? See, l told you.
so, you were saying?
anyway, my father... He grew up on a farm.
he always thought it was a real shame that we only saw the suburbs.
he used to take us on great camping trips. Want more wine?
one night, l was sleeping in my pup tent with my younger brother.
l must have been, what, six or seven.
l woke up in the middle of the night, and l had to get outside.
l don't know why. l just really wanted to go outside.
lt was dark. l mean, totally dark.
not like in the city, or even in the suburbs.
l'm talking absolute blackness.
you couldn't see two inches in front of your face.
but there's one thing you could see.
millions of things, really.
you could see the stars.
there were more stars out that night than l've ever seen since.
believe me, l've looked.
l'm standing there, looking up at the sky, and l'm thinking...
that each one of these dots of light is another world.
l didn't know the difference between the stars and the planets, then.
but it made me feel really small.
lonely.
do you know what l mean?
then l thought, maybe on each one of these other worlds...
there's a kid like me. Only, he's shaped like a sponge...
or a pinball machine, or something. Whatever, but he's up there.
maybe he's on a camping trip, and he's looking up at the stars.
l decided l want to meet this guy.
a rose for the lady? - Would the lady care for a rose?
would the lady care to advance the gentleman the cost of a rose?
put it on the bill. That'd be great.
for you.
thank you. - lt was nothing.
you don't have to sleep on the floor.
what?
you don't have to sleep on the floor.
are you sure?
l won't try anything, l swear.
l trust you.
good night.
how's your lawyer?
my lawyer?
what's his name? Jimmy, Jeremy.
how is Jason, anyway?
Jason's fine.
l guess you really miss him. - l haven't seen him since last summer.
what's he like?
Jason is very directed. He's a real achiever.
l know, but what is he like? l mean, what kind of beer does he drink?
ls he funny? Does he make you laugh?
he is everything a girl looks for in a guy. - He sounds perfect.
we both want the same things out of life.
we're both gonna be lawyers. Damn good ones.
we might even open a practice together, up in Vermont.
somewhere in the country. - l get it.
Jason is the real outdoorsy type.
clear, freshwater streams, fragrant meadows...
biodegradable toilet paper, the works.
lt's just that we both like old farmhouses.
we thought it'd be nice to find one and restore it ourselves.
Jason thinks it would make a good investment.
l just want it to be nice and warm and cozy.
kind of like this.
and we're both crazy about basset hounds.
l guess that sounds kind of tame to you.
lt sounds nice.
good night, Alison.
good night, Gib.
l didn't try anything, l swear. -l know.
you were on my side of the bed. - lt's all right.
nothing happened. - l know.
l'm just gonna go out on the veranda thing for a while.
where you headed? -Los Angeles.
lt's your lucky day. Come on, let's go!
l got it.
so what's in California?
a girl.
what's wrong with her? - She's got a boyfriend.
too bad.
what's she like? - Who?
your girlfriend. - l don't know. l've never met her.
you never met her.
you're going across the country to see a girl you never met.
my best friend, Lance, set it up.
supposed to be a sure thing.
a sure thing?
a sure thing, no questions asked, no strings attached
no guilt involved.
a sure thing.
my whole life, l never had a sure thing.
probably never meet her anyway. She's gonna be gone in 24 hours.
you pay for the traffic tickets, l'll get you in the saddle.
thank you. - Thanks a lot.
l hope you fully appreciate the magnitude of your impending good fortune.
l do.
Alison, where are you going?
wait up.
what is it with you?
you haven't said two words to me since Arizona.
see you around. - That's it?
'see you around " ? -lsn't that what you want?
no questions asked? No strings attached? No guilt involved?
have fun with your sure thing.
l bought this for you. - l bought it!
lt's the thought that counts.
here we are.
here, let me take that from you. lt's really great to see you.
l cleared out this drawer for you.
and you can use this half of the closet.
l bought some of those hangers you like so much.
we'll just put your bags up there after you've unpacked...
get them out of the way.
lt's so good to see you.
look.
flannel sheets.
you know, the longer you use them, the softer they get.
by the time we find our farmhouse...
my goodness, they'll be incredible, won't they?
are you all right?
Yes. Great.
l guess l'm just exhausted from the trip. - Tired.
those sheets are great.
l know what you need. - What?
a good hot mug of tea.
restores both body and spirit. Let's see what we have this week.
let's see, we've got some Darjeeling...
english Breakfast.
that's more of a studying tea, isn't it?
let's see, Lapsang Souchong, for those rainy mornings.
remember that camping trip to Vermont?
of course. China Black.
how about a good hot mug of China Black?
do you have any beer?
private Gibson, incoming!
how are you doing, buddy?
how are you? - Good to see you. Looking good.
looking good. Glad you made it. Welcome to California...
home of the waves and the babes. l want you to meet some people.
guys, this is Gib, the guy l told you about. l said he'd make it.
Hey, dude. - Nice to meet you.
3, 000 miles just to get laid? l really respect that.
tonight is the night, Gib, man.
merry Christmas. - l love you.
l don't think she believes me.
why is that, man? - l don't know.
you are gonna love California. You ever make it with an avocado?
party!
gin.
let's see, that makes 25 for me...
plus...
so, 25 plus 43 is...
can l borrow that?
sorry.
there you go.
...which makes the score 233 for me...
and 8 for you.
charming.
lt sounds like someone's having a party. Let's go. lt'll be fun.
you know how we feel about parties. They're hot, loud and crowded.
the only reason anyone goes to them is to pick someone up.
now, why would we want to do that?
let's go to Disneyland. - Disneyland is for children.
let's do something pointless, something totally crazy.
all right. l tell you what. - What?
l'll spot you 50 points. That'll add some excitement to the game.
l really don't want to wear this stuff. l really don't.
what do you mean? You look fantastic. - Come with me.
what's the first thing you'll do when you meet her?
shave my head and join a Polynesian monastery.
what do you mean? - Tito. lsn't that nice?
what are you doing? - Like that?
what's going on? - l look like a moron.
what do you mean, you look like a moron? Look at me.
you don't like green? ls that it?
l'll get you blue, or the red. - l don't want anyone.
come on. - Because l don't.
what do you mean, because you don't? What is that?
you know what?
you happen to be developing a very bad attitude, young man.
don't move, because she's here.
lt's her. Look.
tonight is the first night of the rest of your sex life.
you're gonna kill me. l don't think l can go through with this.
l knew it. The breasts are too small? - Breasts are fine.
Hi, how you doing? - How are you?
this is a drink for you. - ls that him?
Yeah. - He's cute.
he's kind of going through a little climate adjustment.
and so we're gonna be with you in just a minute.
so why don't you just go over there and look for something, okay?
all right. -l love you, babe. You look good.
what's the problem? What's wrong with you?
l don't know. l'm almost 19. Maybe l'm getting too old for this.
what do you want? A goddamn relationship?
l don't know what l want.
maybe it's a moral issue. -Moral issue?
this is Lance you're talking to. You have no morals.
you're just in a slump, that's all. lt happens to the best of us.
lt could happen to me someday. l doubt it, but it could. You nervous?
get out!
you're nervous, because you haven't done it in a while.
lt's like riding a bike. You just got to climb on and keep pedaling.
and wear something white at night.
you want a relationship? That's fine.
just remember that every relationship starts with a one-night stand.
you came 3, 000 miles for a reason, didn't you?
would you look at that reason?
go for it, you've earned it.
Lance, you're right. - That's right.
l'm not being unfaithful to anyone.
hell, l could use a torrid night of cheap, meaningless lust.
that's right, buddy. There you go.
look at these people.
they probably think they're having a good time.
let's dance.
since when do you like to dance? -Since tonight.
that's a nice shirt.
from Hawaii.
lt's been a long time since l've held you like this.
l know.
lance said you were very shy around girls.
did he mention what a great dancer l am?
what else did Lance tell you about me?
he says you're a real gourmet.
and you're a virgin. - What?
he thinks you might be gay.
l didn't say it. Lance said it.
excuse me, won't you?
l have to go kick the shit out of someone. Just one second.
you told her l was a virgin? - l exaggerated a little.
girls like virgins. They find them a challenge.
you told her l was gay! -lt's a bigger challenge.
keep your shirt on, buddy, you're doing great.
excuse me. l see a sweet young thing whose sarong needs adjusting.
get out of my life.
excuse me, l'd like to get some punch.
please, allow me.
thank you. - You're very welcome.
she's got lovely skin, and so much of it.
she happens to be an excellent judge in quality shirt wear.
she should try wearing one, sometime.
would you like a cup for Justin? - Jason.
whatever. He probably eats paste. -J ustin's twice the man you'll ever be.
he's loyal, he's trustworthy-- -Housebroken?
do you know this person?
not really.
would you like a drink? - No, thank you.
Jason, let's go to bed.
careful, she hogs all the blankets.
you snore. - Not tonight, l won't.
l'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
how would you like to go up to Lance's room for a drink?
all right.
let's go.
good night.
he doesn't even know that girl! - How do you know that guy?
lt was all set up by his friend.
he thinks love is something you order on the phone, like a pizza!
how do you know he snores? - He thinks he knows all about stars.
he doesn't know Cassiopeia's the mother of Andromeda.
how's he know you hog the blankets? - The crap he eats...
cheese balls and beer for breakfast!
how do you know what he eats for breakfast?
come on in.
want to sit down?
do you want me to? - Why don't you sit down?
all right.
do you want a drink? - Sure.
great.
Thanks.
that's strong.
lance sure does drink a lot of beer.
a lot of it's imported.
are you all right? -l'm fine. Why, don't l look fine?
l don't know, it just seems like - l'm not.
ls it that girl at the punch bowl? -No.
lt's nothing. Particularly not that girl at the punch bowl.
why didn't you tell me about him?
because he's not worth mentioning. He's a creep.
you made love to him, didn't you?
did you make love to him? - No.
honest? - Honest.
do you love him?
l have to go to the library. l'm really behind.
that's what l should've done. l didn't study all this week.
me, neither.
want some?
good morning, everybody.
you're gonna have to talk to me sooner or later.
no, thank you. -All right. Here we go.
l've got a very pleasant surprise today. Comes from an unlikely source.
lt is called The Sure Thing.
" lt could be tonight,' he thought...
'as he stood in the corner, pretending to have a good time.
'he would meet her tonight.
'all his young life, he had dreamed of a girl like this.
'5'6 " , silky hair...
'trim, nubile body... "
'Nubile, " by the way, is spelled with a " u. "
'...nubile body that really knew how to move...
'and soft, deeply tanned skin.
'now, as for personality traits, she needed only one.
'she had to love sex, and all the time.
'to arrive at this moment, he had traveled vast distances...
'enduring many hardships:
'abject poverty, starvation...
'show tunes, you name it.
'from across the room he saw her. She was perfect.
'he knew almost nothing about her, and she didn't know much more about him.
'lt was exactly how it was supposed to be. He brought her to his room.
'the lights were soft, the moment was right.
'then she leaned over and whispered in his ear:
" do you love me?'
'thoughts raced through his mind. Did she really want him?
'what had he done to deserve this bounty? Does God exist?
'who invented liquid soap, and why?
" do you love me?' Staring into her eyes...
'he knew that she really needed to hear it.
'but for the first time in his life, he knew these were no longer just words.
'and if he said it, it would be a lie.
" do you love me?' she whispered. 'Do you love me?'
'lt would not be tonight.
'the answer was 'no. " '
he was a traitor!
you didn't sleep with her?
still seeing Jason?
we broke up.
that's too bad.
from the silence
from the night
comes a distant lullaby
soul, surrendering your soul
the heart in you not whole
for love
for love
walked out
cast into the dark
branded with a mark of shame of Cain
lf I could just go back.
if I could rub everything out, starting with myself.
starting with borrowing a jacket.
Oh, such fleeting paradise
such innocent delight
to love
be loved
a lullaby
then silence
most likely you'll know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf.
I couldn 't help noticing your jacket.
Yes.
class of '56.
how is Dickie?
we've enjoyed meeting you.
I do hope that you'll come out and see us.
thank you. That's very kind. -Both of you.
Herbert? - Yes, yes. I very much hope so.
of course, Dickie's idea of music is jazz.
Oh, dear. - He has a saxophone.
to my ear, jazz is just noise.
just an insolent noise.
very nice to meet you. - And you.
sir. - We'll see you at the shipyard.
I hope to. - Good.
I have to run! I'm very late!
Ah, you were great! - You were great.
darling couple, aren't they?
Yes, they are. Exceptional young man.
thanks a lot for the jacket. - Thanks for filling in for me.
take care of that wrist. Bye, Fran.
believe me. Buy I. B.M. now, before it splits.
you'll make yourself a fortune.
you think so?
sorry. Sorry.
sorry.
you've probably heard Dickie's been living in Italy.
Mongibello. South of Naples.
no kind of place at all.
good morning, sir. - Frank.
Marge, his young lady, is supposedly writing some kind of book.
God only knows what he does.
by all accounts, they spend the whole time on the beach or in a sailboat.
that's my son's talent-- spending his allowance.
could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom?
persuade my son to come home?
I'd pay you a thousand dollars.
well, I have always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but
good. Now you can go for a reason.
count Basie.
Duke Ellington? I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
dizzy Gillespie.
my funny Valentine
my funny Valentine.
sweet, funny Valentine
I don't even know If this is a man or a woman.
Charlie Parker?
Charlie Parker. I know it. It's Bird.
Yes!
Ugh.
here. I'll take it. - Thanks.
that thousand bucks should come in handy.
Yes, sir. - I'll get that.
thank you. - Sir. You're gonna have a great trip.
Mr. Greenleaf is personal friends with the Cunard people.
I can tell you, the Greenleaf name opens a lot of doors.
do you speak English? - What's your name, please?
Ripley. - Follow me. No problem.
here, Signor Ripley. - Okay.
uh, there. That one.
this one. - Wait, is that all? Count them.
Attenzione. Just one suitcase, Signor Ripley?
Si. - Attenzione.
what's your secret? - Excuse me?
no, it's just that-- You are American, aren't you?
no, it's just that
I have so much luggage, and you're so, um, streamlined.
it's, you know, humiliating.
I'm Meredith, by the way.
Hello, I'm Dickie. - Meredith Randall.
um, Dickie Greenleaf. - Hello.
you're not the shipping Greenleafs.
Oh, trying not to be.
trying to jump ship.
so, uh, did they put your cases in the wrong pile?
it's just that, uh, you were in the "R" stand.
I thought I saw you there.
my father wants me back in New York.
he builds boats. I'd rather sail them.
so I travel under my mother's nameï¼which is--- Emily.
I'm just kidding.
you know, the funny thing is,
I'm not Randall either.
I'm Logue.
as in-- - As in the textile Logues.
trying to shrug off the dress.
I travel under my mother's name too. - Randall.
right.
so, Rome, Rome, Rome. - Oh.
we're partners in disguise. Bye. - Bye.
bird.
this is my face.
so I guess you didn't look at my new chapter.
I will, Marge. I promise.
it's just been too hot.
if I make dinner at my place tonight, maybe you could look at it then.
Dickie Greenleaf?
who's that? - It's Tom. Tom Ripley.
Tom Ripley?
we were at Princeton together. - Okay.
did we know each other?
hello. Well, I knew you, so...
I suppose you must have known me.
princeton's like a fog.
america's like a fog.
this is Marge Sherwood. Tom-- Sorry, what is it?
Ripley. - How do you do?
how do you do, Marge?
what are you doing in Mongi? - Nothing.
nothing much.
just passing through.
passing through? - Yeah.
you're so white.
did you ever see a guy so white, Marge?
gray, actually.
it's just an undercoat.
say again? - You know, a primer.
that's funny.
margie likes that 'cause she's so white too.
Yes, I do, and you're not funny.
you should come and have lunch with us before you go.
Yes, Dickie? - Sure, anytime.
well, coincidence.
I don't remember him.
that's so funny.
Silvana! Hey!
I've been looking all over for you.
Where've you been hiding?
today you're looking for me. Where've you been the rest of the week?
you're always working. Come on. Get on.
with the American girl?
hold on to me. - I hate you.
huh? - I hate you!
did you suddenly forget where I lived?
I know. I'm late. I'm a swine.
it's 4: 00. - I just woke up.
Ohh. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
you just woke up. - Fausto and I took the boat out.
we were fishing, and then it was dawn, and we caught absolutely nothing.
Mmm, yes, well, we ate everything without you.
we? - Yes.
Tom Ripley's here. - Who?
Tom. Hello. - Hi.
hello. -How are you? Thought you'd disappeared.
we were gonna send out a search party. - No.
no, still here. - Tom was telling me about his journey.
made me laugh so hard I almost got a nosebleed.
is that good? - Shut up.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm despicable. But I love you.
do you love me? Do you love me? - I'm intruding.
can you mix a martini?
sure. - I'll do it.
Ohh. - I make a fabulous martini.
everybody should have one talent. What's yours?
forging signatures, telling lies, impersonating practically anybody.
that's three. Nobody should have more than one talent.
okay, do an impression.
now? - Yeah.
the only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
what? - Oh, I like to sail.
believe me, I love to sail.
instead, I make boats. - Stop!
other people sail them. - It's too much!
you're making all the hairs on my neck stand up.
Oh, yes. Jazz. Oh, jazz. Let's face it.
it's just, uh-- It's just insolent noise.
I feel like he's here.
horrible, like the old bastard's here. - Good.
that's brilliant.
brilliant! How do you know him?
Oh, I met him in New York.
Marge! Marge, this is scary.
you've got to hear this. Meet my father,
herbert Richard Greenleaf I.
pleasure to meet you. Dickie's made a fine catch.
uncanny! - I know Emily thinks so.
I don't get it. - It's uncanny.
could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, and, uh, bringing him back?
what? - I'd pay you.
if you would go to Italy, persuade my son to come home, I'd pay you a thousand dollars.
I'm never going back.
to actually hire somebody to come all the way here...
to drag me back home
got to be a little insane, doesn't he?
Ciao, Fausto.
this is Tom. - Ciao, Tom.
I'm never going back. - No, I think
your mother, her illness, I think that's
it's got nothing to do with my mother.
she's had leukem-- This is what makes me boil about him.
he wants me back. He wants me back.
it's got nothing to do with my mother. - Look, I don't know
go back. Go back to New York.
or call him, if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard.
Hi, Tom. - Hi.
Marge, Tom's saying good-bye.
Oh, I'll come down.
so, uh, did you speak to my father?
Oh, you were right... about the telephones.
I told you. - There are no lines.
there's some problem. - That's Italy.
Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Oh, back, I suppose, as slow as I can. Oh!
this bag!
Hey. You like jazz.
I love jazz.
this is the best.
baker, Rollins.
Marge says she likes jazz, but she thinks Glenn Miller's jazz.
I never said that! - Bird.
that's jazz.
bird? Ask me the name of my sailboat.
I don't know. What's the name Of your sailboat?
look! Look! Bird!
which is ridiculous. Boats are female.
everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
he's not a man. He's a god. - Okay, we're going to Naples.
there's a club-- It's not a club, it's a cellar.
it's vile. -Yes, it's vile. You don't have to come.
it's great. It's-- It's great. You're gonna love it.
how are you?
Oh!
that'd be cool. Bring him up.
Tom Ripley!
come on! Get on up here!
Yeah!
I'll tell you when to join the chorus.
come on.
okay. Together!
I bumped into an old friend from Princeton, - a fellow called Tom Ripley.
he says he's going to haunt me until I agree to go back to New York with him.
afternoon.
what time is it?
Oh, God. - "Go back to New York with him.
here-- - You always type your letters?
that should be two T's. - I can't write, and I can't spell.
it's the privilege of a first-class education.
your room's upstairs at the back.
I think Ermalinda made up the bed. Ermalinda!
this is so good of you. - Don't say it again.
now that you're a double agent and we're going to string my dad along, what if we were to buy a car with your expense?
okay. - Great.
Hello, Tom. - Hello.
Marge, Marge, what do you think?
little Ciquencento with my dad's money?
Oh, please, Dickie. You can't even drive a car.
you can't even drive. - What we need urgently is an icebox.
what do you think? Agree with me, and I'll be your friend for life.
I absolutely agree with Marge. - Hmm.
icebox. Icebox.
so, what, is he gonna move in with you?
it'll just be for a little while. He can be-- He makes me laugh.
okay, darling. - Promise you'd say?
no, I like him. - Marge, you like everybody.
don't like you.
then I'll go to your place. And you can move in with Tom.
I like him.
Marge, you like everybody.
no, I like him.
Marge, you like everybody.
now you'll find out why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast.
it's not love. It's my coffee machine.
ever since Ermalinda showed him how to make his own espresso. He feels like quite the grown up.
I bought the coffee machine. - Oh, darling, is that for me?
this is for Tom, because he didn't complain.
that ring is superb.
Oh, Tom, I love you. See?
Ooh! I had to promise, capital "P," never to take it off.
otherwise, I'd give it to you. -Isn't it great? I found it in Naples.
I had to bargain for it for about two weeks.
I hope it wasn't cheap, Marge.
Oh, it was.
I have to get a birthday present for Frances, so perhaps you could help me.
engaged? You're a dark horse, Ripley.
who is she? - Your parents met her.
Oh, God. Oh, I can just imagine.
if only Dickie would settle down.
doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild?
Oh, God. Never. Never.
I swear on your ring, Marge, I'm never going back.
say when to pull. - Pull now. Pull.
it's not pulling. I'm doing it wrong.
better now, huh? - Okay, okay, okay.
we'll make a sailor of you yet.
you're doing really well.
all right. Bar's open. - Yes, please.
Hey, can we sail to Venice? - Sure. I love Venice.
"see Venice and die." Isn't that right? Or is it Rome?
is it Rome? - I have to see Venice.
you do something and die, don't you? Okay. Venice is on the list.
and Rome.
do you ski?
Ah, no, no. Don't tell me.
you're a lost cause. That's the next thing to deal with.
Christmas, we're planning a skiing trip to Cortina.
excellent skiing. Excellent. Marge. - Yes?
unbelievable. Tom can't ski either.
we'll have to teach him that too. - Thank you.
such low class, Marge. Does this guy know anything?
good thing we're not getting married soon.
we'd have to invite Tom on our honeymoon.
Oh, I hated New York. That whole Park Avenue crowd.
so I fled to Paris to work on my book.
and I was always going to this cafe in Monmartre with Jean-Jaques.
and Dickie would play "My Funny Valentine."
it was only later that I found out he only knows about six songs.
anyway, I looked forward to seeing him, I suppose.
Hey, hey, Signor Greenleaf!
you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
okay, fine. - Oh, Dickie!
Oh, hold on. Hold on.
Silvana, Silvana
you make me smile
I need to talk to you.
you're breaking my ribs! - What?
you're breaking my ribs!
but don't
change a hair for me
not if you care for me
stay, little Valentine
stay
each day is Valentine's Day
Ohh!
I could fuck this icebox, I love it so much.
so, what did you actually do in New York?
played piano in a few places. I told you.
well, that's one job. You told me a lot of jobs.
few places. That's a few jobs.
the mysterious Mr. Ripley.
Marge and I spend hours speculating.
anyway, I don't even want to think about New York.
are you ready?
cold beer. Thank you, Dad. - Okay.
copy out from here.
you bring this with you to Europe? - You gonna write something?
I love the fact that you brought Shakespeare with you but no clothes.
Ermalinda says you wash out the same shirt every night. Is that true?
no. I have more than one shirt.
she can do that for you.
anyway, just wear some of my stuff.
wear anything you want. Most of it's ancient.
now your signature.
not Dickie. Your signature.
without the glasses, you're not even ugly.
I don't need them because I never read.
how do I look? - Like Clark Kent.
now Superman. - Superman.
okay. - I know.
it's like a kid's. See this, the "S" and the "T"? Fine, vulnerable.
that's pain. That's secret pain.
well, that must be a very deep secret, 'cause I don't know about it.
hmm. There's nothing more naked than your handwriting.
see how nothing's quite touching the line?
that's vanity. - Well, we certainly know that's true.
do you have any brothers?
no.
no brothers, no sisters.
me neither.
nor does Marge.
all only children.
what does that mean?
means we've never shared a bath.
and I'm cold. Can I get in?
no.
I didn't mean with you in it.
okay.
get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
it is me. It's an old picture.
every time! "Is it you? It doesn't look like you.
God!
letters-- Greenleaf and for Ripley.
Ooh. Fran. "l miss you. When are you coming home?
stop telling me what an incredible time you're having.
how much you love Dickie. - Whoo!
and Marge and Mongibello.
and this one, I think, is from your father.
let me see it. What does he say? - He's getting impatient.
he wants me to reassure him that you're going to be home by Thanksgiving.
you've got to get a new jacket. Really.
you must be sick of wearing the same clothes.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
I love how responsible you are.
my dad should make you Chief Accountant or something.
or when I take over, which is never, I will.
okay. When you take over, which is never, I'll accept.
let me buy you a jacket. When we get to Rome, there's a great place
Battistoni. - Battistoni.
roma, we're taking Tom to Roma
we're going to a-Roma
buon giorno. Nice sweater.
where do we get a carrozza for the Forum?
can we just hire any of them? - Relax.
relax!
it's just there's so much to do in a single day.
the most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Freddie?
Freddie. Freddie Miles.
Freddie's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
Oh.
Oh, here he is.
Frederico! - Comestai?
Oh, God, don't you want to fuck every woman you see just once?
only once? - Absolutely. Once. Ciao.
Tom Ripley, Freddie Miles. - Tom.
I mean, hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying.
you look gorgeous. - As always.
so, mangiare.
Si. I got us a table outside at Fabrizio's. Tommy.
outstanding. I tell you, - I'm so cabin-crazy with Mongi. - I know. I was there.
look, Tom, we got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's.
the best thing is, if you want to be a tourist, grab a cab now, and I'll meet you at the railway station.
what club?
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd.
come if you want, but I thought you wanted to go sightseeing.
I do, and then maybe get the jacket and what have you.
Dick! You gotta hear this.
listen, just take one of mine when we get back.
don't worry about it.
come on!
Ciao. Have fun, okay?
you said to make sure you didn't miss the train. Leaves at 8: 00.
have a good time.
see ya, Tommy.
if I meant anything to her
I'd be brave, and here's the song I'd bring to her
I'd sing to her
may I be the only one
to say I really fell in love the day I
first set eyes on you - May I - What are you doing?
Oh. I was just amusing myself.
sorry. - I wish you'd get out of my clothes.
do you have my shoes on too? - You said I could pick out a jacket.
did you get undressed in your own room?
thought you missed the train.
freddie drove me back in his car.
is Freddie here? - He's downstairs.
I was just fooling around.
don't say anything. I was just fooling around.
sorry.
God. A corduroy jacket in Italy.
good morning, Tom. - Morning.
come join us.
Hey. I want this job of yours, Tommy.
I was just saying, you live in Italy, you stay at Dickie's house, you eat Dickie's food, you wear his clothes, and his father picks up the tab.
if you get bored, you let me know, 'cause I'll do it.
I'll do it. - To the mainland!
you really should go in. It's marvellous.
I'm fine.
are you okay?
sure.
the thing with Dickie
it's like the sun shines on you, and it's glorious.
and then he forgets you and it's very, very cold.
so I'm learning.
when you have his attention, you feel you're the only person in the world.
that's why everybody loves him.
it's always the same. Whenever someone new comes into his life
Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley.
he's wonderful. Have you met him?
especially you.
and that's just the boys.
come get him! Come get him!
tell me, why is it that when men play, they always play at killing each other?
he's drowning me! He's drowning me!
I'm sorry about Cortina, by the way. - What about Cortina?
didn't-- Didn't-Didn't Dick say?
he spoke to Freddie, and-and apparently it's not going to work out.
it's because everyone else can ski, and it affects where you stay, and
come on, Freddie.
at least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
the whole town comes out-- - I don't think so.
I have my own, uh, Madonna backin Rome. Why don't you come back with me?
a lot of ladies. Ooh.
Oh, God. - You want to take over?
Yeah, sure.
just point her at Capri. Avoid the rocks.
where are you going?
Marge maintenance.
Aye-aye.
don't.
Dickie
Tommy. How's the peeping?
Tommy, how's the peeping?
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.
is someone getting an ambulance?
is someone getting an ambulance?
what's the fight about? That's her fianc, isn't it?
I don't know. Why are you asking me? - Are they blaming him?
how can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
she was already dead, darling, wasn't she? So I suppose
I don't know why people say this country is civilized.
Dickie! - It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
I'll go see what's the matter.
I'll go.
I know why you're upset.
I know about Silvana, Dickie.
I know about you and Silvana.
what about us?
you don't have to clean up! Really!
like what? - Forget it.
she was pregnant. Did you know that?
Silvana was pregnant.
do you know what that means in a place like this?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
what are you talking about? - You've been so good to me.
you're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
I would do anything for you, Dickie.
she came to me for help.
she needed money.
I didn't help her. I didn't help her.
now she's drowned herself, and it's my fault.
I'm not going to say anything to Marge, to the police or anybody.
it's a secret between us, Dickie.
and I'll keep it.
dear Tom. In view of the fact Dickie shows...
no more signs of coming home than before you went--" blah, blah, blah
um
l hope that the trip has afforded you some pleasure...
despite the failure of its main objective.
you no longer should consider yourself obligated to us in any way.
can't blame him.
you could hardly expect this to go on forever, Tom.
well, you can write again.
especially now we're brothers. - I can't.
how can l, in all decency.
you said it yourself. It's my dad's money you're spending.
we've had a great run though, haven't we?
well, we'll still go to Venice. We could stick to that plan.
I don't think so, Tom.
you can't pay your own way, can you?
it's time we all moved on.
I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now, with everything
I really want to move to the north.
I need to check out San Remo next week.
find somewhere new to keep the boat.
it would be great, though, if you came with me to San Remo.
there's a great jazz festival. We could say good-bye in style.
what do you think?
our last trip!
sure.
why do you do that thing with your neck?
what thing?
on trains, you always do that thing.
spooky.
Spook-- k-k-- k-k-- k-k
spooky.
Oh!
didn't I tell you San Remo was crazy?
this is more like it! Come on!
Grazie.
to Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
to Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
did I know you at Princeton, Tom?
I don't think I did, did I?
why are you asking all of a sudden? - No reason.
because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there.
Why? - I mean it is a compliment.
you've got such great taste.
most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste.
I used to say, "the cream of America: rich and thick."
Freddie's the perfect example.
then I'll take it as a compliment.
I knew it! I knew it.
Marge and I had a bet.
do you even like jazz, or was that for my benefit?
I've gotten to like it. - Oh, yes!
I've gotten to like everything about the way you live.
it's one big love affair.
if you knew my life back home in New York
I'm thinkin' of givin' up the sax.
what do you think about the drums?
what? - So cool.
I'm gonna rent a boat tomorrow, take a look around.
this is how I found my place in Mongi.
took a boat out...
around the bay, first thing I liked,
I got it.
Whoa! - Come on, Dickie. Don't go crazy.
Dickie. Slow down! - Hold on.
wait a minute! It's gonna tip! Oh, God!
stop it! Somebody! Somebody! Stop it!
Oh, I love it here!
I love it here! I'm gonna move here!
beautiful.
I want to tell you my plan.
so tell me. - Well, I thought...
I'd come back in the new year under my own steam.
Really? To Italy? - Of course.
and I figured, just for argument's sake, say I got a place.
or say we split the rent on a house,
I could get a job, or, better still, if I got a place in Rome, and then when we're there, we could be there, and when we're here, we could be here.
I don't think so. - Particularly with the Marge problem.
you just blame me.
Marge and I are getting married. - How?
how? - Yesterday, you were ogling girls.
today you're getting married? That's absurd.
I love Marge. - You love me. You're not marrying me.
Tom, I don't love you. - No, I don't mean that as a threat.
to be honest, I'm-I'm a little relieved you're going.
I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
what? - You can be a leech!
you know that!
and... it's boring.
you can be quite boring.
the funny thing is, I'm not pretending to be somebody else, and you are.
boring. -I've been absolutely honest with you about my feelings.
boring. - But you-- First of all,
I know there's something.
that evening, when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious.
what evening? - It's too dangerous for you to take on.
Oh, no, no. We're brothers.
Hey. And then you do this sordid thing with Marge-- fucking her...
on the boat, while we all have to listen, which was excruciating.
and you follow your cock around like a-- And now you're getting married.
no, I'm bewildered. Forgive me.
you're lying to Marge and then you're getting married to her.
you're knocking up Sylvana, ruining everybody-- You want to play the sax.
you want to play the drums. Which is it, Dickie? What are you actually
who are you? Huh? Some third-class mooch? Who are you?
who are you to say anything to me?
who are you to tell me anything?
actually, I really, really do not want to be on this boat with you.
I can't move without you moving. - Shut up. Shut up.
it gives me the creeps. You give me the creeps.
you shut up. - I can't move without "Dickie, Dickie, like a little girl all the time.
shut up!
Oh, God, Dickie.
God's sake. - Oh-- Oh God!
okay. Okay.
we have to get you-- Okay
I'm gonna kill you! Kill you!
you're dead!
stop! Stop! Please! Please!
stop it! Stop!
Dickie, let go! - I'll kill you!
stop! Stop! Stop!
stop! Stop! Stop!
Hi. Can I have my key, please?
of course.
you must be very cold. Uh, Signor Greenleaf, yes?
no. I'm
Hello, Marge.
Tom!
you startled me!
sorry. How are you? - You're back!
your book going well? - Yes.
I'm on a good streak, Thank you.
I was just... looking at you. So quiet.
Where's Dickie?
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Rome? Ahh. Did he say why?
I don't understand Dickie. Your guess is as good as mine.
what does that mean?
Oh, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not.
one day, we're one family, then the next day he wants to be alone.
you tell me.
is that what he said? He wants to be alone?
he was thinking of you. He asked me to deliver this.
thank you.
he knows I love this.
but why it couldn't have waited. I-- - Errand number one.
deliver Marge's perfume.
errand number two:
pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
how long is he staying for?
search me. I guess we're abandoned.
God damn it!
are you okay?
there was a letter from Dickie in with my perfume.
you realize it's more than just a few days.
he's thinking of moving to Rome.
the thing is, the night before he left, we
we talked about moving together...
somewhere north, and I suppose I...
put some pressure on him about getting married.
I just
I just might have scared him off.
there's a side to him when our heads are on the pillow...
I know no one else sees that's so tender.
the king's forgotten his visor.
I almost died! Don't you understand?
I have no heir. Only a daughter and a bastard son.
all my father's work finished and it's my fault!
there is to be a summit between king francis and king henry.
now he's not only charles v, the king of spain, he's also the holy roman emperor!
it may suit us better to do business with him than
together, how could the french withstand us?
is the emperor in fact sincere about this treaty?
of course he is.
the emperor has won a great victory against the french.
the french king was also captured on the battlefield.
he's now the emperor's prisoner.
the king of portugal, your future husband, loves and respects you.
you must love him in return.
remember your promise. When he dies, I marry whom I choose.
take care of her.
I will.
I have no doubts.
some men who seem at the peak of health suddenly collapse and die.
some old men, they can go on for years.
do you tease me because it amuses you?
why else?
because you love me.
how do our affairs proceed?
the king makes no obvious declaration but it's possible to detect it in the way he glances at her.
you must know I desire you with all my heart.
now everything has changed.
I married my brother's wife and god has punished me.
I want a divorce.
and you will get one for me.
you think you know a story.
but you only know how it ends.
to get to the heart of the story, you have to go back to the beginning.
WBITEBALL PALACE LONDON
sir thomas boleyn, you are by order and permission of his majesty, king henry!
today created lord rochford.
arise my lord.
Majesty.
Henry fitzroy.
Henry fitzroy, you are, by order and permissionf f his majesty, king henry, today created duke of richmond and of somerset, and earl of nottingham.
arise, your grace.
his eminence, cardinal wolsey.
your majesty.
I see his majesty's bastard son is made a duke.
does this mean he is next in rank to his majesty?
next in line to the throne?
above my daughter?
Yes. Technically.
he is set above all others, except for... a legitimate son.
his majesty loves our daughter.
he has shown it on many occasions.
I cannot believe he wishes to place his bastard child above her!
I do not believe...
that his majesty was personally responsible for this action.
after all, our daughter is engaged to the emperor.
then your majesty has not heard.
the emperor has married princess isabella of portugal.
apparently he decided it was not worth waiting for your daughter to grow up.
and who is to say but perhaps he was influenced by the fact that the beautiful isabella brought with her a dowry of 1 million pounds.
he broke his word.
my lord.
how your tokens and signs of affection frighten me.
how can I be to you what you think me to be?
you know I am a commoner and I think myself unworthy of your love.
thither offer of it and the passion of your majesty's words and looks touch both my heart and soul.
you have flattered me with so many and such wondrous gifts.
allow me to send you this token in return,
small though it is.
and allow me to remain,
in all things,
your everloving servant.
Anne.
your grace.
mama!
now, henry, listen to me. You are going to own your own house now.
you'll have lots of servants to help you and look after you.
but you must promise me to be a good boy and thoughtful and kind to those around you.
you may be set above them but if I find you have grown too proud I will be sad and displeased.
Yes, mama. I promise.
and I promise I'll come and see you as often as I can.
and I'm sure your new house will be very grand!
I love you, my darling boy.
I love you.
do you think they were suspicious? Ever?
of course they were suspicious!
didn't you see the way his servants looked at you?
but his son was overjoyed. I mean, his majesty was overjoyed.
after all, he had waited many years for the crown.
the old man had hung on grimly.
you need not tell me about that!
what are we going to do?
isn't this enough?
no. Well, yes and no.
we shall come to england eventually.
marry me.
what?
you heard me.
marry me.
my poor sister.
indeed.
to be made queen for just a few days. It seems incredible.
a tragedy.
upon her return she is to be treated to every comfort and kindness, while she mourns.
as to the great matter of your majesty's annulment.
I have set up an ecclesiastical court with archbishop warham to consider and decide on the matter.
it will meet in secret, if your majesty agrees.
make sure they come to the right decision.
quickly.
I have some further news.
about the emperor.
he has released king francis.
What?!
I have it on good authority.
under what terms?!
I have yet to find out.
why wasn't I consulted? We're supposed to be allies!
what's he playing at?
tell his ambassador I want to see him.
Anne! Anne!
Anne.
I want to say something to you.
if it pleases you to be my true, loyal mistress and friend;
to give yourself up to me, body and soul
I promise I'll take you as my only mistress.
I won't have a thought or affection for anyone else.
if you agree to be my maitresse en titre,
I promise I shall serve only you.
maitresse en titre?
your official mistress?
Yes!
and you will have everything you need.
everything within my power to give to you. It's yours, just ask.
what is it?
what have I done to make you treat me like this?
done?
what fault have I committed? Tell me!
tell me.
your majesty I have already given my maidenhead into my husband's hands.
and whoever he is, only he will have it.
Anne...
because I know how it goes otherwise.
my sister is called "the great prostitute" by everyone.
I'm sorry if I offended you.
I did not mean to.
I spoke plainly of my true feelings.
your majesty.
Majesty. - Open the door!
Mary. Mary.
go to your room. I will come later.
another visit, your eminence!
Majesty, I have some good news.
since his majesty has given his son, the duke of richmond his own establishment, he considers it only should also have hers.
what do you mean?
his majesty intends to send the princess to ludlow castle in the welsh marches.
she will be under the care of lady salisbury, her lady governess.
her tutor, dr. Fetherston will also accompany her, along with 300 members of the princess's household.
she is to be taken away from me?
no. His majesty is according her the true honours of a princess.
this is your idea.
madam, I am often accused of things that are not my fault or responsibility.
some people are always prone to speak evil without knowledge of the truth.
I fear they may have poisoned your majesty's mind against me.
you are taking my child from me!
my child!
you are tearing her from me, as if you were tearing her from my womb.
I do as his majesty commands.
no.
you are my enemy.
your majesty is unfair.
get out of my sight.
Mary.
Mary!
the ambassador of his highness the holy roman emperor.
senor mendoza,
I am not pleased to see you.
Majesty?
your master has broken all his promises.
he has taken our money but used it against us.
he has negotiated a separate peace with the king of france and his holiness the pope while neglecting his friend and ally!
he has not kept faith.
Charles has nothing but words for me!
deeds he keeps for others!
the emperor would never betray your majesty. Never!
he regards you as his uncle he his fucking uncle!
how old am I?
well, your highness must consider that you, yourself, may not always have kept to your obligations.
after all, we received only half the amount of gold that was promised.
your accusations are totally false!
unacceptable!
I will answer for my honourable conduct, whoever contradicts me!
leave.
my lord rochford.
Yes, your honour.
the emperor sends you his warmest congratulations on your elevation.
what does the emperor care about my elevation?
he cares to have friends at the english court and pays for the privilege.
does he have many friends here already?
several.
you would know them.
and what does friendship pay?
1000 crowns a year.
I will certainly consider his highness's gracious offer.
your grace.
my lord!
so how did you find the imperial ambassador?
stimulating.
indeed.
I find him a man of great principle.
indeed.
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah indeed.
my lord.
no, I was just listening.
Yes. I...
you have such a talent.
Orpheus himself would be jealous, I think.
sir.
good day, sir william.
a very good day to you.
isn't the music divine?
Yes, I quite agree.
ladies.
sir william.
no, george! Please. Give it back!
I have given you my heart now I desire - to dedicate my body to you. - Don't! Please.
written by the hand of him who in heart, body and will is your loyal and most ensured servant, hr. Aw...
and look! He's drawn a little heart between the lett h and R.
just imagine, the king of england writing to my little sister promising to be her servant.
it's incredible.
give me the letter.
he's in love with you.
give the letter!
you're not in love with him are you?
he wants a divorce?!
it's not a divorce.
the king wants an annulment on the grounds that he was never married in the first place.
by marrying his brother's wife he has offended the laws of both god and man.
he simply wants that recognized.
the pope gave him a dispensation to marry katherine!
indeed he did.
no one denies it.
but the king feels more beholden to god than he does to the pope.
his conscience is genuinely stricken, and tender.
he has disobeyed god's injunction and there's nothing his holiness can say or do that can alter that fact.
the pope is god's representative on earth.
he speaks for him.
Oh, come, come thomas. What are you pretending?!
kings get divorced all the time.
and popes always find an excuse.
I know you're an idealist but you're not stupid!
if henry wants an annulment who's to stop him?
alright. You talk of fact.
let me give you a fact.
Catherine of aragon is not only a great queen and the daughter of great kings, she is also immensely popular throughout the whole of the country.
God forbid that the king should abandon her just to ease his own conscience.
I don't think the english people would ever forgive him.
does she know yet?
does she know yet?!
LAMBETB CBURCB

good people of lambeth.
on this good friday the queen's majesty will distribute alms to you unfortunate but true and loyal subjects of their majesties...
in the christian spirit of charity and love.
bless you.
and you.
God be with you.
in good faith.
your majesty, I beseech you, help me.
God bless you.
do not be afraid. You are god's child.
bless you.
wanna see our business?
sorry, love.
my dear william.
Charles, welcome back, good to see you.
you too. Come, sit down, have a drink.
I just don't understand. Why here?
we've been expecting you back at court.
how is the king?
anxiously awaiting his sister to share her grief.
we're married.
what?
she... and me!
we're married.
you and...?
Yes.
here you are, sir.
you have to tell him.
you have to tell the king.
I have to tell him? Why do I have to tell him?
because it'd be better coming from you.
what's the matter, charles? Have you lost your nerve?
this is no laughing matter.
then why did you do it?
you know me.
I don't always think.
yes you do.
just not with your head! Huh?
Henry? You katherine, I have something to tell you.
as far as I'm concerned our marriage is at an end.
actually... there is no need to end something which has never been.
you and I were never truly married.
there was a misunderstanding of scripture and a papal misapplication of canon law.
it's true I...
I did not know about these things before but...
but it has been brought to light by learned opinion.
and it weighs down my conscience.
it has forced me to give up your bed and board once and for all.
all that remains is for you to choose where to live and to retire there as quickly as possible.
I swear to you all will be done for the best.
your grace, my lords...
I believe you know why we are gathered here, in private.
we are here at his majesty's bidding.
his majesty has requested an inquiry into the nature of his marriage to catherine of aragon, for the tranquility of his conscience and the health of his soul.
for as it says in leviticus:
if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an impurity;
he has covered his brother's nakedness;
they shall be childless.
now, if my lords, we are able to agree between ourselves that the marriage was, in fact, never legal, and was proceeded with against both canon and ecclesiastical law as his majesty, to his great regret, has come to believe then it is my understanding that, as papal legate,
I myself have the power and authority to dissolve and end it.
but of course I would be grateful to hear the opinions of your lordships' on this great matter.
your grace?
I am inclined to agree with your eminence, though I reserve judgment until I have heard all opinion.
my lord fisher.
I see no merit in the king's case, so expressed. None whatsoever.
if there was any obstacle to the king's marriage then it was overcome by the pope's dispensation.
the marriage was therefore legal and as your eminence knows, divorce is disallowed by the church.
that is my opinion.
madam.
lady salisbury's here.
your majesty.
I have brought your daughter to say goodbye.
my baby.
your majesty must be reassured.
the princess will be well taken care of, as befitting her station.
you will be sent regular reports of her health and accomplishments.
and naturally you will visit her during the course of your majesty's progresses.
you must make sure she practices her music.
she has a great facility for music.
be STRONG MY DAUGHTER, REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE.
the DECEENDENT OF ISABELLA AND FERDINAND OF CASTILLE.
the ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF ENGLAND.
be STRONG , AND BE TRUE AND ONE DAY...
one DAY YOU WILL BE QUEEN.
Yes, mama.
is he sorry?
does he repent it?
tell me! Does he beg my forgiveness?
your majesty knows his grace.
you mean he does not?!
send in my sister.
you are not wearing black.
no, your majesty.
but you are in mourning.
your husband is dead.
I said your husband is dead!
he's alive!
my husband is alive.
I gave you no permission to marry brandon.
nor would I ever!
you gave me your promise! I was free to choose.
I made no promise! You are mistaken!
how dare you look at me?!
I am your lord and master not your brother!
you are both banished from court.
you will relinquish your london houses.
you will remove yourself from my sight.
do you understand?
yes...
your majesty.
and margaret?!
what?
I have yet to decide whether to make your bedmate a head shorter.
say yes.
say yes.
you're married.
so?
so...
why deny me?
I do not love you.
is that all?
for me. Yes.
you're so beautiful, tom.
you're a lord.
what am I?
a genius.
what is it?
a parcel, your majesty.
who is it from?
the lady anne boleyn.
a ship with a woman on board. What is a ship?
a ship is protection, like the ark that protected noah.
the diamond?
what does it say in the roman de la rose?
a heart as hard as a diamond, "steadfast...
never changing.
she is the diamond and I am the ship.
she says yes!
king francis is eager for a rapprochement with your majesty.
he is disgusted at the treacherous behaviour of the emperor towards you behaviour he knows only too well having suffered it himself at first hand and offers you instead a true and lasting friendship.
it is true, the emperor has betrayed us.
perhaps he was never sincere in the first place.
even so, he still has friends at court.
which friends?
my agents intercepted this letter.
the letter is from the queen.
she asks why the emperor doesn't write to her more often.
and promises, as always, to be his true and humble servant.
his servant not mine.
tell the french ambassador that we are in the mood for a rapprochement with king francis.
tell him to send delegates.
let us be allies against this emperor.
my lady.
I lay claim to your maidenhead.
and I make you this promise:
when we are married, I will deliver you a son.
no.
I shall honour your maidenhead until we are married.
no less can I do for love.
Oh my love.
love...
and by daily proof you shall me find, to be to you both loving and kind.
I hate you!
you said it would be alright! You said he would believe you!
that's what you said! That's what you promised!
for the love of god, wife!
don't call me wife.
I don't want to be your wife. I hate you!
no, you don'T.
Yes, I do.
if it weren't for you I would still be the queen of portugal.
and now what am I?
you are drunk and you are foolish!
Henry will forgive us. He is just standing on his pride.
we just wounded his vanity. Believe me.
huh.
why should I?
I don't know if you're really brave or if you're just a fucking fool.
neither do I.
Oh god...
thank you, alice.
I know you've talked to wolsey.
and I know you do not approve of what I am trying to do.
it's against your conscience.
and I'm not gonna try and change your mind.
that's unlikely, in any case.
but I need you to understand, thomas.
I need to explain.
I have been living with my brother's wife and I have come to believe their marriage was consummated.
if that is true, then I have been living in sin.
can you understand what that feels like, thomas?
that is why I asked the cardinal to examine the matter.
but what if it can be proved that the pope's dispensation was valid and that there was no sin?
then I shall be the happiest man alive.
I shall be content to live with catherine until the end of my days.
wait.
I ask you again if the king is so troubled by his conscience, why has he waited so long to bring this matter to a head?
because of his love for the queen, he has denied the truth to himself.
but her failure to produce a living son, is proof of it!
then he wants to remarry?
if his marriage is annulled, then yes I am certain he will remarry, in the hope of producing an heir.
he has an heir!
I do not believe for a moment that the english people will accept his bastard son as a legitimate heir and nor does the king!
he has a legitimate daughter!
my lords, english history is littered with the tragedies of those who have tried to pass on their crown to a daughter!
then...
he has a new wife in mind?
he has a mind to take one, yes.
it stinks!
I think you should be careful, my lord.
as should you!
one of the great advantages of having a library, your eminence, is that it is full of books.
and some of these books contain ecclesiastical law.
and according to those books you have no authority to judge this matter.
it is for the pope alone it is for the pope alone or those whom he appoints.
it seems that in this case, your eminence, your reach has exceeded your grasp!
so, I have invited a french delegation to visit your majesty's court, to discuss a new treaty, binding us together in the face of the emperor's intransigence and aggression.
good. Excellent.
and since the emperor has reneged on his promise to marry your daughter, it could perhaps be politic to resurrect her betrothal to the dauphin.
or if the dauphin has already promised, perhaps to the duke of orleans, king francis's youngest son.
and what of your secret sessions?
have they come to a decision?
how soon can I expect my annulment?
your majesty should not be concerned but uh...
we were not able to come to a conclusion.
not able?
the matter is a complex one.
Really? How?
it is my considered opinion that we should apply to his holiness, pope clement for a ruling on this matter.
since he loves your majesty I am certain he will rule in your favour.
Oh, I hope so.
I certainly do hope so.
for your sake.
you can always tell the french.
Oh, yes. The ponces.
they never did anything so clever as giving wolsey a pension.
he's never failed them.
we must wait and see.
when the wheel of fortune has reached its zenith, there is only one way for it to go.
Mm hmm.
move aside! Out of my way!
I bring most important news!
your majesty! Rome has been sacked!
let him through!
your majesty, I bring most terrible and calamitous news.
Rome has been captured and sacked by the german and spanish mercenaries of the emperor.
they have plundered and befouled its churches, destroyed its relics and holy treasures, tortured and killed thousands of its priests.
what of his holiness?
the pope is a prisoner in the castel sant'angelo.
he is the emperor's prisoner?
Yes.
lady blount.
he caught the sweating sickness.
there was nothing we could do.
he complained this morning of feeling ill.
by this evening he was in the hands of god.

Thanks, Mr. Devlin.
Thanks, everybody.
well, you're trying to get a mission to accomplish.
planning for a second date.
the people dig for me.
what is so hard?
you don't have to say something like "excuse me."
you want to get some coffee?
when I see beautiful woman, I can't talk.

there's a beautiful woman in the gallery.

it's just no guys will do anything for me like what you did for her.

Yeah, nice working with you too.
Hello?

I only drink organic green tea.

fine, coffee.
I love coffee. You learn quickly.
is that your happy face or your horny face?
I'll tell you later.
so beautiful.
we're the same temperature now.
Hey, Bella, you're a lot stronger than I am right now.
it's your turn not to break me.
I love you.
I love you.
Renesmee.
she's incredible.
where is she? I have to see her.
wait. Wait.
you need to get your thirst under control.
Yeah, you'll need to hunt.
close your eyes.
what do you hear?
Bella, don't!
Bella, stop!
I'm sorry, I didn't realize there'd be people this far from the trails.
I have to get outta here.
okay, I can help you.
or not.
well, I'm amazed.
you ran away from human blood mid-hunt.
even mature vampires have problems with that.
you're still here.
so are you.
I didn't expect you to seem so you.
except for the creepy eyes.
I would keep my distance for now.
it's safer for the baby to see how you do with me first.
since when do you care about Renesmee?
all right.
take a whiff.
well, I can see what everyone's been talking about.
Jake, you really do stink.
you guys really look great together.
want to come meet our daughter?
welcome to the family.
you look amazing, Bella.
someone's been waiting to meet you.
rose.
beautiful.
what was that?
she showed you the first memory she has of you.
showed me? How?
how do I hear thoughts?
how does Alice see the future?
she's gifted.
I've only been out for two days?
her growth rate is unprecedented.
all right. That's enough experimenting for one day.
Jacob.
she's doing great.
Yeah. Let's not push it though.
what's your problem?
Oh.
do tell her, Jacob.
this should be good.
hold on a second.
Bella.
look, it's a wolf thing.
what's a wolf thing?
um...
you know we have no control over it.
we can't choose who it happens with.
and it doesn't mean what you think, Bella. I promise.
take Renesmee out of the room.
Oh.
Edward, don't touch me right now.
I don't want to hurt you.
Oh.
you imprinted on my daughter?
it wasn't my choice!
she's a baby!
it's not like that.
you think Edward would let me live if it was?
I'm still debating it.
I've held her once!
one time, Jacob!
and already you think that you have some moronic wolfy claim on her?
she's mine!
it's fine, Leah.
you're gonna stay away from her.
you know I can't do that.
stop her, Edward.
he said it's fine.
she's amazing, right?
do you remember how much you wanted to be around me 3 days ago?
that's gone now, right?
long gone.
because it was her.
from the beginning it was Nessie who wanted me there.
Nessie?
you nicknamed my daughter after the Loch Ness monster?
Seth, are you okay?
Seth, I'm sorry.
he'll be all right.
Bella, you know me better than anyone.
all I want is for Ness and Renesmee to be safe. Happy.
look, nothing ever made sense before.
you. Me. Any of it.
and now I understand why.
this was the reason.
finally.
my turn.
where does she sleep?
in my arms. Or Edward's or Esme's.
happy birthday.
I stopped aging three days ago.
well, we're celebrating anyway. So suck it up.
I still hate surprises. That hasn't changed.
you'll love this one.
welcome home!
we thought you guys might like a place of your own.
what do you think?
I think it's perfect.
go inside.
have fun.
this will be Renesmee's room.
closet.
Wow.
Alice stocked it for you.
clearly.
this is our room.
vampires don't sleep.
it's not intended for sleep.
you really were holding back before.
I'm never gonna get enough of this.
we don't get tired.
we don't have to rest or catch our breath or eat.
I mean, how are we gonna stop?
Rosalie and Emmett were so bad, it took a solid decade before we could stand to be within five miles of them.
I think we might be worse.
definitely worse.
Wow.
done already?
Where's Renesmee?
blondie stole her.
break a lot of stuff?
Emmett.
no.
is that Charlie?
he's been calling twice a day.
he's in pretty rough shape.
eventually, we'll have to tell him you didn't make it.
he needs to mourn, Bella.
okay. We'll do it tomorrow.
I'm gonna miss this place.
we'll come back. We always do.
wait.
nobody said anything about leaving.
once people believe Bella's dead, we can't risk anyone seeing her.
so you just disappear?
jacob, we don't have another choice.
Hey.
you heard anything?
Charlie,
Bella is...
uh...
no, she's not.
no, no, no, I mean, she's fine.
she's back home and she's feeling better.
why didn't you say so? That's great.
wait.
there's something you need to see first.
I need to see Bella.
look, in order for Bella to get better, she had to change.
what do you mean, "change"?
here goes nothing.
what the hell are you doing?
you don't live in the world you think you do.
jacob, put your clothes on.
now, this may seem strange.
really strange. But stranger things happen every day.
trust me.
holy shit!
look, I solved a problem.
you were leaving.
what did you expect me to do?
you don't realize the danger you've put him in.
the Volturi will kill anyone who knows about us.
no, I didn't tell him about you. Just me.
I only said you were different.
and that we have a niece who we adopted.
I mean, seriously, Jake, he's not just gonna let that go.
did you consider the physical pain he'll put Bella through?
it'll be like sticking a white hot branding iron down her throat.
and that's assuming she can control her thirst.
look, Charlie's been in hell.
and I know you'll be much happier with him in your life.
jacob, don't try and pretend you're doing this for anyone but yourself.
sorry you feel that way because he'll be here in 10 minutes.
what?
these will irritate your eyes at first.
the main thing is not to move too fast.
try taking a seat. Crossing your legs.
maybe a tad slower. Hmm.
and blink at least three times a minute.
good.
for a cartoon character.
hold your breath. It will help with the thirst.
just don't forget to move your shoulders so it looks like you're breathing.
and don't sit so straight.
humans don't do that.
okay. I got it.
move around, blink, slouch.
good luck.
Hello, Charlie.
Where's Bella?
Bella.
Hi, Dad.
are you okay?
never better.
healthy as a horse.
you don't turn into an animal, too, do you?
she wishes she was that awesome.
let's give them some privacy.
uh, Jake said that this this was necessary.
what does that mean?
I really think it would be better...
I wanna know what happened to you.
I can't tell you.
I think I deserve an explanation.
you do.
but if you really need one, I can't stay here.
Oh, come on! No!
no more going away!
dad, you're just gonna have to trust that for whatever reason,
I'm all right.
I'm more than all right.
can you live with that?
can I live with that?
well, I don't know, Bella.
I mean, I just watched a kid I've known his entire life turn into a very large dog.
my daughter looks like my daughter.
but doesn't.
can you please just believe that I'll tell you anything that you need to know?
and I don't need to know this?
no.
really, you don't.
well...
not gonna lose you again.
I can't.
then you won't.
I promise.
I missed you, Bella.
so much.
I missed you, Dad.
Charlie.
this is Renesmee.
your niece?
our daughter.
right.
the adoption.
Renee-semee?
she's got your eyes, Bella.
need to know, I guess.
well done, Bella.
never seen a newborn show that kind of restraint.
I'm not sure she is a newborn.
she's so tame.
Emmett, don't antagonize her.
she's the strongest one in the house.
please.
don't hurt yourself, Emmett.
all right. On 3.
1, 2, 3!
did you see that?
thank you.
my time as a human was over.
but I never felt more alive.
I was born to be a vampire.
everything was falling into place.
even the Volturi seemed to accept my new status.
though they'd want proof eventually.
it seemed we had only one enemy left.
time.
Renesmee was growing too fast.
we all worried about how long we would have with her.
it just made every moment more precious.
look, a snowflake.
it's beautiful.
why don't you go get another one?
edward thinks that we'll find answers in Brazil.
there are tribes there that might know something.
who was that?
I think that's our cousin from Denali.
Irina!
Tanya convinced Irina to come reconcile with us.
it looks like she changed her mind.
seeing Jacob must have been too much for her.
wish I could have just spoken to her.
she's family. She'll come around.
what a pleasant surprise.
what do you want?
hmm?
I have to report a crime.
the Cullens...
they've done something terrible.
allow me, my dear.
Oh, my.
what is it, Alice?
the Volturi.
they're coming for us.
Aro, Caius, Marcus, the Guard.
and Irina.
honey, come here.
Why?
what did Irina see in the woods?
we were just walking.
ness was catching snowflakes.
of course.
Irina thinks Renesmee's an Immortal Child.
the Immortal Children were very beautiful.
so enchanting.
to be near them was to love them.
but their development was frozen at the age they were turned.
they couldn't be taught or restrained.
a single tantrum could destroy an entire village.
humans heard about the devastation.
stories spread.
the Volturi were forced to intervene.
since the Children couldn't protect our secret, they had to be destroyed.
No!
No!
No!
their creators grew very attached and fought to protect them.
long-established covens were torn apart.
countless humans slaughtered.
traditions, friends, even families. Lost.
no, no!
mother! - No!
mother!
so the Denalis' mother made an Immortal Child?
Yes.
and she paid the price.
well, Renesmee's nothing like those children.
she was born, not bitten. She grows every single day.
so can't you just explain that to the Volturi?
aro has enough proof in Irina's thoughts.
so we fight.
their offensive weapons are too powerful.
no one can stand against Jane.
Alec's even worse.
well, then we convince them.
they're coming to kill us, not to talk.
no, you're right.
they won't listen to us.
but maybe others can convince them.
Carlisle, you have friends all around the world.
I won't ask them to fight.
not fight. Witness.
if enough people knew the truth, maybe we could convince the Volturi to listen.
we can ask this of our friends.
at least we get to go to London again.
we haven't been there in a long time.
all right. Let's get this show on the road.
Alice asked me to give you that.
she and Jasper crossed our lands to the ocean last night.
Carlisle?
they've left us.
Why?
she didn't say.
can I see that?
gather as many witnesses as you can before the snow sticks to the ground.
that's when they'll come.
Alice's instructions were clear, but the question remained.
why would she and Jasper leave at the moment we needed them most?
what did they know?
our search for witnesses began with a trip north to our closest relatives.
Edward, is everything all right?
why didn't you tell us you were coming?
is it Irina?
have you heard from her?
not directly.
why is your bride waiting in the car?
and why have you brought a wolf with you?
I can smell him from here.
my family is in danger. I need your help.
what's happened?
it's hard to explain but I need you to be open-minded. Can you do that?
of course.
okay.
time to meet some new people.
what if they don't like me?
they'll love you. - They will.
once they understand you.
they just haven't met anyone like you before.
okay.
the Volturi will come for all of us.
you get that thing out of here.
she's not what she looks like.
this is a crime!
stay back!
she has blood in her veins.
you can feel her warmth.
I can feel it.
I'm her biological father.
Bella is her mother. - Impossible.
it's true. She was born while I was still human.
I've never heard of such a thing.
she can show you, if you let her.
Tanya, you owe us this much.
we're all under a death sentence because your sister didn't let us explain.
don't be afraid.
this is how she communicates.
it's true.
she's not immortal.
I knew the rest of our family would face this fear as well.
fear of the unknown.
fear of the Volturi.
amun, please!
I cannot help you, Carlisle.
I wouldn't ask if it weren't urgent.
you must go.
I'd like to hear about it.
I never get to meet any of Amun's friends.
he likes to keep me hidden.
I can't imagine why.
Carlisle. - Benjamin.
benjamin can influence the elements.
and here I get super self-control.
who are they?
senna and Zafrina.
from the Amazon.
the arrival of Senna and Zafrina meant that our plea was being heard in even the most remote corners of the world while others searched for witnesses closer to home.
a patriot Carlisle first met on the battlefield at Yorktown would become our most unlikely ally.
shut up!
I hated the first British Invasion.
and I hate the second one even more.
even the Beatles?
really, Garrett?
old habits die hard.
Carlisle needs you.
sounds interesting.
help!
but first I'd better finish my meal.
help me! Help!
each of them was won over.
each was made to see.
Carlisle convinced his Irish friends to make the journey to Forks.
although we were grateful for their help, their thirst for human blood complicated the situation.
the nomads Rosalie and Emmett sent were even more unpredictable.
especially Peter who had fought alongside Jasper as a newborn.
lotta red eyes around here.
they agreed not to hunt in the area.
but they'll feed somewhere.
as more vampires set foot in their territory, more Quileutes turned.
their nature compelling them to join the pack.
Hey, easy there. Hey!
it's all right.
you're gonna be okay.
finally, Carlisle and Esme returned with our last witness.
how many came? - Eighteen.
you have some good friends.
and Alice?
we'll all be on Aro's list now.
centuries on the run. That's what you've brought me.
some friend, Carlisle.
alistair, come meet everyone.
I already told you, if it comes to a fight, I won't stand against the Volturi.
it won't come to a fight.
I'll be in the attic.
he's not a people person.
we opened our home to 18 vampires.
many with gifts of their own.
Zafrina had power over the mind.
she could make anyone see what she wanted them to.
if she weren't holding my hand right now, I could swear this was real.
I don't see anything.
Edward, you didn't tell me your wife is a shield.
what's a shield?
the ones I've met are so different.
it's a defensive talent.
it's why I couldn't read your mind, even before.
it's why Aro couldn't.
you have a very powerful gift.
Oh, yeah, she's a shield, all right.
shoulda put her on her ass.
or your voltage has been exaggerated.
maybe it only works on the weak.
Garrett, I wouldn't.
you are an amazing woman.
now, you guys can do some serious damage.
which is why you'll need to control your phasing.
if your mom pisses you off, you don't want to tear her head off.
whoever's coming wasn't invited.
Whoopa!
Vladimir, Stefan, you're a long way from home.
what are they doing here?
we heard the Volturi were moving against you.
but that you would not stand alone.
we didn't do what we were accused of.
we do not care what you did, Carlisle.
we have been waiting a millennium for the Italian scum to be challenged.
it's not our plan to fight the Volturi.
shame.
Aro's witnesses will be so disappointed.
they enjoy a good fight.
Aro's witnesses?
Aww.
still hoping they'll listen?
when Aro wants someone from a coven it's never long before evidence turns up proving that coven committed some crime.
so he's done this before?
it happens so rarely, I never realized it was a pattern.
apparently he always pardons one person whose thoughts he claims are repentant.
this person always has an ability.
and they're always given a place with the Guard.
this is all about Alice.
he has no one like her. - Which is why she left.
why does he need witnesses?
to spread the word that justice has been served.
after he slaughters an entire coven.
Benjamin, Tia, - we're leaving. - And where will you go?
what makes you think they'll be satisfied with Alice?
what's to stop them from going after Benjamin next?
or Zafrina or Kate or anyone else with a gift? Anyone they want.
their goal isn't punishment, it's power.
it's acquisition.
Carlisle might not ask you to fight, but I will.
for the sake of my family. But also for yours.
and for the way you want to live.
the packs will fight.
we've never been afraid of vampires.
we will fight.
this won't be the first time I fought a king's rule.
we'll join you.
no.
I will do the right thing, Amun.
you may do as you please.
we will stand with you.
so will we.
that didn't take much.
let's hope it doesn't come to that.
we'll see.
everyone showed courage.
though we knew that Aro's army was moving against us.
soon we would face the dark gifts of Jane.
and worse, the paralyzing vapor of her brother Alec who could rob you of sight, sound and touch.
I refused him!
I refused him!
I'm not with Carlisle!
Alec?
I will never go against you.
of course not, my dear Toshiro.
it seems Carlisle is still expecting you.
Carlisle is all but ensuring his own destruction.
sad, isn't it?
aro will want us incapacitated before he attacks.
Jane and Alec will try and take me out first because I can anticipate their moves.
too bad we don't all have your shield.
doesn't help me fight, though.
no, but you could help the rest of us, if you could project it.
what do you mean?
I mean shield someone other than yourself.
is that possible?
gifts can be developed. Over time.
at first, mine was just in my palms.
now I can radiate it all over my body.
how do you do it?
tell me. - Ow.
you need to visualize it.
see how it moves.
what color it is.
now picture it expanding.
will it to go beyond you.
I think she needs something to motivate her.
no. - It's all right, I can take it.
he says that now.
focus, Bella, or he's gonna be hurting.
Edward, I'm not ready to do this yet.
I'm sorry. I said that I wasn't ready.
dude, you're not motivating her.
you want to try?
Kate!
you seem to lack incentive.
shall I go see if Renesmee's awake?
are you crazy?
all right.
this one's on full power.
it's painful, but it's bearable.
okay, we should go again.
Emmett.
I'm good.
there's sweet music here that softer falls than petals from blown roses on the grass.
or night dews on still waters between walls of shadowy granite in a gleaming pass.
music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies.
mom.
hmm?
did Aunt Alice and Uncle Jasper run away because we're gonna die?
no.
I think they left to keep us safer.
that's what all these other people are here for, too.
I'll never let anybody hurt you.
come here. Go to sleep.
it's strange.
physically, I feel like I could demolish a tank.
mentally, I just feel drained.
how about a bath?
I do remember how to undress myself.
Yeah, I just do it so much better.
Bella,
I've had a bad habit of underestimating you.
every obstacle you've faced,
I'd think you couldn't overcome it.
and you just did.
you're the reason they have something to fight for.
my family.
I'm gonna get the water running.
Alice made sure only I would get the message.
because only my mind would be safe from Aro.
I'm surprised you took a break from Jedi training.
if I don't take Renesmee to my dad, he'll come to us.
27 vampires, one human.
not so great.
I know that's what you told Edward.
whatever.
I'm just glad to get away from all those reeking bloodsuckers.
I'm sorry.
I know.
they're the good guys.
but come on,
Dracula One and Two are creepy.
there she is. Come here.
Oh!
Wow! Look at you.
you've grown half a foot!
seriously.
like 6 inches.
come on inside. Lunch is on the table.
we got a tree to decorate, huh?
I've actually got a few errands to run, guys.
I'll be back soon, okay?
come on. Let's go.
Alice's note gave me a new sense of hope.
maybe she had a plan for us after all.
and maybe J. Jenks was the key.
I'm meeting Mr. Jenks. - Right this way.
Mrs. Cullen. - Hi.
I'm so happy you called.
I always meet my private clients here.
it's more comfortable than the office.
and it's more public.
Ah.
what type of work do you do, J?
Oh, you know, this and that.
it's always different, which keeps it interesting.
have you known Alice and Jasper long?
I've been working with them for more than 20 years.
and my late partner knew Jasper 15 years before that.
he is, uh, unusually well-preserved.
Yes, he is.
I trust that Mr. Jasper is enjoying his vacation.
he didn't tell you where he was going, did he?
no, no, no, he just mentioned that he was leaving when he came by to place his order.
I assume that his order is ready?
of course.
I've never been late with a delivery.
there a problem?
no.
my husband and I thought that we'd all be traveling together.
Jasper said only two were traveling.
his instructions were very clear.
it's my mistake.
apparently, that's not going to happen.
Alice's vision was clear.
Renesmee would have a future.
but Edward and I wouldn't be a part of it.
how ya doing?
my dearest Renesmee,
I thought we would have forever together.
but forever isn't as long as I'd hoped.
I know now why Alice left me clues.
it was to keep you safe.
everything you and Jacob will need is in this pack.
jacob will protect you.
and he'll help you learn about the Ticuna legends.
it's a romantic notion, isn't it?
that a righteous few can defy a great evil.
I must admit, you even had me believing.
for a moment.
well, good luck. You're gonna need it.
Cheers.
the snow is sticking.
Hey, we still have today.
I'm so glad Charlie found somebody to take care of him.
Bella, no one's giving up here.
all right! Present time! Let's go!
Seth, Leah, stop eating.
Jake, you start. Get it going.
what did you get me? - I'm not giving you anything.
Hey! No, come on, what did you get me?
well, Dad, we didn't have time to wrap yours, but here it is.
it's a 5-day fishing trip to Fraser River.
it's for you and Sue.
you leave tomorrow.
wow, that's really nice. Thank you.
tomorrow? I can't leave tomorrow.
I made arrangements for you at work.
sneaky.
and extravagant.
and non-refundable, I'm afraid.
you two trying to get rid of me?
because it's working!
fraser River. That means we'll be chasing Cutthroat.
we might even hook a Rainbow or some Bulls.
woman knows her trout.
Hey, beautiful. Let me see.
jacob make this for you?
wanna put it on?
it's so pretty.
it is really pretty.
that's what I'm talkin' about.
a little pre-battle bonfire.
telling war stories.
or just standing there like freackin' statues.
name any American battle. I was there.
little Bighorn.
I came this close to biting Custer.
but the Indians got him first.
try Oleg's assault on Constantinople.
he didn't win that one on his own.
if you're talking battles, you're talking the Eleven Years' War.
no one does rebellion like the Irish.
you lost the Eleven Years' War.
Aye. But it was one hell of a rebellion.
when we ruled, everything came to us.
prey, diplomats, favor seekers.
such was our power.
but we never put on white hats and called ourselves saints.
we were honest about what we were.
we sat still for a very long time.
we didn't notice we were beginning to petrify.
perhaps the Volturi did us a favor when they burned our castles.
we've been waiting 1, 500 years to return that favor.
we have been ready to do battle for ages.
I can't help thinking, all these people are putting themselves in danger because I fell in love with a human.
you found your mate.
you deserve to be happy.
but at what cost?
everyone here has something to fight for.
I certainly do.
Carlisle, I've never thanked you.
for this extraordinary life.
this means "More than my own life."
that's how much I love you.
tomorrow I'm gonna need you to stay with Jacob.
no matter what.
even if I tell him that...
that he has to take you somewhere.
Hey.
baby, it's all right.
you're gonna be safe.
always.
if we live through this,
I'll follow you anywhere, woman.
now you tell me.
the Redcoats are coming! The Redcoats are coming!
Aro's looking for Alice.
Aro, let us discuss things as we used to.
in a civilized manner.
fair words, Carlisle.
but a little out of place, given the battalion you've assembled against us.
I can promise you, that was never my intent.
no laws have been broken.
we see the child.
do not treat us as fools.
she is not an Immortal!
these witnesses can attest to that.
or you can look.
see the flush of human blood in her cheeks.
Artifice!
I will collect every facet of the truth.
but from someone more central to the story.
Edward, as the child clings to your newborn mate,
I assume you are involved.
I'd like to meet her.
Ah.
young Bella.
immortality becomes you.
I hear her strange heart.
Hello, Aro.
Magnifico!
half mortal, half immortal.
conceived and carried by this newborn while she was still human.
impossible!
do you think they fooled me, brother?
bring the informer forward.
is that the child you saw?
I'm not sure.
Jane.
she's changed. This child is bigger.
then your allegations were false.
the Cullens are innocent.
I take full responsibility for my mistake.
I'm sorry.
Caius, no!
Irina!
blind them.
give me my sight back.
Tanya, this is what they want.
if you attack now, we'll all die.
pain.
it's working.
Aro, you see there's no law broken here.
agreed.
but does it then follow that there is no danger?
for the first time in our history humans pose a threat to our kind.
their modern technology has given birth to weapons that could destroy us.
maintaining our secret has never been more imperative.
in such perilous times, only the known is safe.
only the known is tolerable.
and we know nothing of what this child will become.
can we live with such uncertainty?
spare ourselves a fight today, only to die tomorrow.
no.
Alice.
Alice!
my dear, dear Alice, we're so glad to see you here, after all.
I have evidence the child won't be a risk to our kind.
let me show you.
brother?
it doesn't matter what I show you.
even when you see.
you still won't change your decision.
now!
take care of my daughter.
get them.
Hmm!
take her away.
let her go!
Jacob!
Jacob!
Jacob!
Jacob!
watch out!
Bella!
finally.
now you know.
that's your future.
unless you decide on another course.
we cannot alter our course. The child still poses a grave threat.
but what if you were sure she could remain concealed from the human world?
could we leave in peace?
of course. But that cannot be known.
actually, it can.
I've been searching for witnesses of my own among the Ticuna tribes of Brazil.
we have enough witnesses. - Let him speak, brother.
I am half human, half vampire.
like the Child.
a vampire seduced my mother, who died giving birth to me.
my aunt Huilen raised me as her own.
I made her immortal.
how old are you?
150 years.
at what age did you reach maturity?
I became full-grown seven years after my birth.
I have not changed since then.
and your diet?
blood, human food.
I can survive on either.
these children are much like us.
regardless, the Cullens have been consorting with werewolves.
our natural enemies.
dear ones, there is no danger here.
we will not fight today.
such a prize.
we have them on the run. Now is the time to attack.
not today.
you're all fools!
the Volturi might be gone.
but they will never forgive what happened here.
you have a beautiful family.
she's gonna be around for a long time, isn't she?
a very long time.
I'm glad she has you.
so should I start calling you "Dad"?
no.
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah. We're all gonna be together now.
I wanna show you something.
what?
I'm Edward Cullen.
how did you do that?
been practicing.
now you know.
nobody's ever loved anybody as much as I love you.
there's one exception.
will you show me again?
we've got a lotta time.
forever.
forever.
they should been down a week ago
tell me you're proud of this.
tell me this job was done right
to start with, the frame is supposed to be 36 inches wide.
this is 31.
explain how a wheelchair is supposed to fit through here.
because I measured it!
Jonas: Never mind. Your assistance is no longer required.
Hello, serena.
Serena: We're getting pancakes!
we were gonna see if you guys...
you know what? I'll do it myself.
it has to be done before...
and I said I will do it.
before our friends arrive.
like I said, I will do it.
and I would appreciate...
maybe I can...
I would appreciate it if in front of our friends you will tell me why you doubt my word.
I mean, am I know as a man of my word?
MOLLY: Not when it comes to housework, no.
you know what? I will swear by anything that you name that I will finish this door before our friends arrive.
Serena: Pancakes! Pancakes! [Telephone rings]
and i'd be more than happy to help.
no, I don't need your help.
because when I vow to do a thing, there's not a thing in this world that I cannot do.
Yes, he's right here.
this is blane.
Yes, sir.
get your things. We're being deployed.
the door will have to wait.
tell ron and ruthie sorry I wasn't here.
mommy, when do I get my pancakes?
the best two points to hit the defense minister are here and here.
and intel's sure the convoy's taking that route?
two teams are deploying. They better be.
we bag Hasan, Taliban's down for a year.
and someone in d. c. Gets his ticket punched.
first chopper in should cover the north post.
we'll do it.
could be a tough landing.
we've had worse.
altitude's higher, less oxygen.
nothing we can't handle.
it is a better position for the shot.
he's putting his head up for the first time in 3 years.
I don't mind aviating to nail that son of a bitch, right?
seeking glory was napoleon's downfall.
and those who claim not to, lie.
I'll flip you for it. Fine.
Uh-uh.
this time I'll think I'll use my own coin.
OK. It's only fair that we toss it, then.
dares wins the first shot at this guy.
call it. Heads.
alpha team stakes their fortunes on heads.
tails gives it to bravo team.
you have the first chopper.
until then, then.
see you in the tall grass. You got it.
boss? I'm listening.
Ryan wants me to lead my own team.
he came to me yesterday.
is there a problem?
I told him I don't know.
I mean, this team's just starting to gel.
it was rough losing pickney, but brown's working out.
and if I'm gone, you'd all be at square one breaking in another newbie.
you want me to talk you out of it?
no, i just don't want to abandon you guys.
sooner or later, you were gonna get tapped.
either or.
if you ain't got any more information, it's time to make a decision.
there's no one I'd rather take on a mission, but you can't be my number two forever.
if I'm not sure I'm ready?
go for blane.
first time on a huey.
I can't believe the navy still uses them for transport.
it's the desoto of the ariel world.
I didn't know they shook so much.
6, 000 parts flying in close formation.
Coots: Snake doctor, this is bushmaster, over.
bushmaster, this is snake doctor, come in.
our bird's having some engine problems.
we'll have to put her down.
give us your coordinates.
we'll come back and pick you up, over.
this is kilo-6-alpha.
be advised you are on a time-sensitive mission, over.
Roger that, kilo-six-alpha.
snake doctor, this is bushmaster.
you're team can take the north l-z.
I say keep going, but it's your call, over.
Roger that. We'll keep flying. Snake doctor out.
tell me that's not what I think it is.
a baby spoon?
a lucky charm.
it's Serena's. Kim likes me to carry it.
knew a superstitious ranger once.
wouldn't put his blood type on his boots.
carried a saint michael's medal.
the guy was like a walking 4-leaf clover.
first mission to desert storm, he makes a halo jump.
his chute doesn't deploy.
I'm just trying to keep the missus happy.
keep your team happy.
next time I see you packing crap instead of ammunition, i'll strip you naked and start from scratch.
I know. I usually leave it in my locker, let her think that i've got it on me.
I just forgot to leave it this time.
Oh. Well, never mind the sermon, then.
sergeant blane, flight two says they can't fix the helo.
they went in hard and bent the bird up.
they're 150 kilometers behind.
how far to our l-z?
about 30 minutes.
after we insert, go back and get 'em.
can do easy.
Coots: Snake doctor, this is bushmaster.
we're under attack.
locals must have seen us land.
I repeat, we're under attack.
bushmaster, this is snake doctor.
any casualties, over?
Coots: Two alpha is... wait! We're getting hit here!
heavy small-arms fire!
bushmaster, say again.
Coots: His legs are trapped in the helo. We gotta cut 'em out.
base commander, on radio: Bushmaster, this is kilo-six-alpha.
can you secure a perimeter?
Coots: We're trying. Hostiles coming from all directions.
they got us pinned.
heavy effective fire now. We need an extraction.
Roger that, bushmaster.
we're headed your way.
base commander: Snake doctor, stand by.
we turn back now, we won't have enough fuel to get to the target l-z.
how long will it take you to refuel?
turnaround time: 2 hours.
base commander: Snake doctor, this is kilo-six-alpha.
advise you complete your mission.
we will extract the bravo team shortly.
you got another bird available?
negative. After you reach the target l-z, your helo will return to extract, over.
that'll take too long.
Bravo team will have to sit tight.
are you superseding my command?
negative. Just offering analysis and support.
we've only got cover of darkness for a half hour more.
Roger that, kilo-six-alpha.
we're moving to extract bravo team.
snake doctor out.
we got two alpha out, but he's down with a busted knee.
Jonas: Are you near the helo?
negative. Negative.
destroyed the crypto gear.
made it down to the valley.
we're in a ditch near some rocks about...
about 30 degrees south.
bushmaster, we see your position.
Coots: Things are quieting down now.
looks like some of the tribesmen are leaving.
Jonas: Roger that.
base commander: Snake doctor, get in and get out.
Wilco.
fly low, but don't land yet.
pull out! Pull out! Pull out!
baited ambush! Oh, yeah!
this is bushmaster.
they're dropping mortar rounds.
we'll have to come in another way.
go back to that pocket on the first ridge.
that far out?
it'll take a little longer, but we need the protection of distance.
space for time.
kilo-six-alpha, we need a uav overhead.
base commander: Wilco, snake doctor. You'll have one shortly.
once you're in, I don't have fuel to wait for you.
do what you have to do.
MOLLY: Jonas was hoping you would be here.
Jonas did that?
the post engineer was very helpful.
you did that!
from Idaho. What's this?
deer jerky.
you still salt it with gunpowder?
Oh, I've been know to.
feed me. [Both laugh]
they want you to practice the unveiling.
unveiling? Yes.
there will, of course, be an actual plaque at the shooting range.
did they spell my name correctly?
awful close. Like to see?
they also want you to fire the first round to christen it.
hmm. Is that jonas' idea?
we can't thank you enough, the both of you.
where is he?
on deployment.
Yeah, but where?
I'd tell you if I knew myself.
I believe I'll use that new facility now.
Ruthie, I need my kit. It's in the car.
no.
I need it.
I don't think you do.
I have to shave.
you had your kit 2 hours ago at the rest stop.
you could have shaved there.
[Chuckles] I'll get it myself.
Ron, no! No!
not here! Not in their home!
Ruth, the last time we talked, he was doing well, you said.
his recovery's as complete as it's gonna get, physically.
that's what the doctors tell him.
well, what?
you'll have to ask him.
Jonas wanted very much to be here.
Ron needs him.
Jonas wanted to talk to him about a job here on the base.
high-level post in training and selection.
they're saying it calls for a veteran.
I told jonas I didn't know how you'd feel about it.
you'd be against it most likely.
you shouldn't have worried.
what I think doesn't matter.
why is that?
I'm gonna leave him.
Albright: Alpha team on deck. Returning to base.
base commander: Roger that, flight one.
bushmaster, snake doctor. How you holding?
Coots: Mortars coming from 6 o'clock.
just about got us bracketed.
we got you spotted.
base commander: Snake doctor, we have a uav over your location.
we have good video.
so long as I'm with him, I'm the hero.
so brave. How does she deal with it?
but then if I do leave him...
say something, molly.
ask me what you want to know.
you'd shun me, wouldn't you, you and the other wives, if I left him.
no. Why do I care?
I'm not here anymore.
I swear to god, this would be so much easier if he were whole.
God forgive me.
Ron, can l...
I'm fine.
and the lord sayeth, "it is not good that he be alone.
and I will make a helpmate for him.
what if I talked to ron, told him to take the job?
then you'd be back here living on the base.
I don't know.
you wouldn't be alone.
Hello, leona. Molly.
Oh.
Hi. Are you sergeant major cheals?
Ron cheals, yes.
this is my wife ruth.
such an honor. I'm leona mullens.
leona's married to one of our younger operators.
she's going to be singing at your dedication.
very nice.
Molly tells me you used to be jonas' team leader, saved his life a couple of times.
that was a while ago.
well, I wanted to consult with molly about the music, but... well, now that you're here, maybe I can ask you, sergeant major?
which would you prefer?
God bless america's traditional, but... I don't know.
sometimes it can sound like a memorial, you know what I mean?
Molly was saying how you like all them old cowboy songs...
Leona, this will have to wait.
Ron has to get to rehearsal.
OK. Sure.
MOLLY: Is it ok if I ride with you, ron?
Ruthie might want to stay here, freshen up, get some rest.
Mack: Where are these mortars coming from?
damn, spotter's got to be nearby.
you see that? Yeah.
missed by 8 meters.
Yeah, wind shifted.
two minutes left. Dial it in.
observe my shot, adjust for me.
Aah!
he won't do that again.
guess they know we're here.
Coots: Snake doc, it's getting ugly down here.
we're gonna make a run for that ditch about 500 meters up valley.
bushmaster, I see your tree line.
fraid you're gonna be easy pickings for that machine gun.
sit tight. We'll deal with the gun.
Coots: What about the mortar?
we killed the spotter.
they're firing blind.
Coots: Sure about that?
affirmative.
snake doctor.
orbit your drone 400 meters northwest.
over. Base commander: Wilco.
found them.
D. J: You're listening to ktml, the missile firing at you with all hits all the time.
so that's a real job?
do they have money for fake ones?
well, they pay the officer corps.
Jonas wanted to be the first to tell you about it.
he has more about the details.
is he sure that I accept?
he didn't think he'd have to talk you into it.
Ron, I'm sorry.
did I say something?
just having a bit of a hard time here.
the thing you saw this morning between ruthie and me.
Ruthie thinks...
jerk!
Hey, you you cut me off!
take a hike.
Hey!
you come out of there!
OK! Ron.
what?
what do you want to say to me?
huh? What? What?
it's cool.
it's what?
no problem, brother. Forget it.
just remember to buckle up while you're on base.
Hey! You get back over here!
Hey!
Hey!
we're gonna be late.
I need to make a stop.
it's the v. a. It's on the way.
dirt, Diver, Moreno, you guys OK?
Yeah, we're ok. You?
couldn't be better.
bushmaster, this is snake doctor.
Coots: Roger, snake doctor.
machine gun has been neutralized.
appreciate it.
when you guys make it to the next big ditch, we will rendezvous at...
Bushmaster! Bushmaster!
do you read me?
bushmaster, come in!
Jonas: No, we killed the spotter.
we got a lucky hit.
we're going down for an assessment. Over.
base commander: Advise against that, snake doctor.
flight one has refueled and heading back to your p-z.
then you need to send a little bird to extract bravo.
send one as soon as I get one.
you mean by nightfall. They could be wounded.
we're not seeing any movement down there, and we've lost all radio contact with bravo.
it could be their radio got shot out.
Roger that. Your priority...
I know what my priorities are, and I'm giving orders.
you send that little bird now.
I'm going to check on survivors.
snake doctor out.
anything? Nope.
thermal imaging?
too hard to make anyone out.
I'm going down.
you'll need this, then.
how about mortar?
take care of that for me, will you?
Hi. Are you...
maybe you can help me.
I'm Kim Brown. I'm here about the internship.
Why?
Why?
you're listening to KTML, the missile, firing at you with all hits all the time.
stay tuned for the area road report, next.
Yeah, why this place?
I feel I got to ask, seeing as how I'm the general manager.
you? Oh.
so... you also do on-air?
Yeah, whenever one of my personalities fails to show up, or quits.
all right.
well...
can I be honest?
it's the fastest way to get credits.
I want to get my degree in a couple of months.
I have another thing scheduled.
yeah? What?
another thing I have to do.
what?
it's just... another job?
no, I'm pregnant.
you gonna tell me that's a problem?
Nope. You married?
uh, yes. My husband works on base.
Oh. Army wife.
something funny?
let's just say i've had experience...
ahem... experiences.
Uh-huh. Well, I'm a self-starter.
I'm reliable. Great.
my husband has no problem with me working off base.
it's an opening in our business department.
Yes, I understand it includes marketing, sales, maybe even some copy writing?
and there's a couple of other candidates.
Oh.
well...
here's what.
go to this address.
collect a check.
it's for an ad run. They're past due.
you bring a check back, i'll consider you for a position.
Lacey lou's kitty kat korner?
it's not a pet store.
I know what it is.
is there a problem?
no.
the area road report is brought to you by dale's custom mufflers.
you can hear the road report every half hour here on ktml, the missile.
I'm Kim Brown. I'm from KTML.
you want to talk to me?
you the owner?
Lacey lou, yep.
I'm Kim Brown.
from the radio station?
that's right.
all right.
I'm here for a check.
it's, um, for the last 20 days ad rotation, and if you want to pay for the next in advance...
why would I want to pay for the next 20 days for an ad that hasn't done nothing for me for the last 20?
I'm sorry...
I got the same number of people come here, maybe less.
your ad, that's doing nothing.
plus we got a sales guy, sold me on the idea of 50 cent beer night Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdays.
net result...
I'm losing money.
I don't see anybody doing anything to make up for it.
thing is, you should be paying me.
well, I don't...
but you, uh, got a better idea... no, l...
like taking it out in trade?
listen, why don't you give me a minute?
let me take a look at your order?
welcome now teena, the fabulous teena.
she can do it this way, she can do it that way.
she's flexible.
she'll bend over backwards to please.
why don't you stick around?
lunch is when I try out the new girls.
good-bye, old friend.
Wirth! Can you hear me?
Oh, yeah.
wirth, you ok?
snake doc...
Yeah, kid.
it's me.
kilo-six-alpha, this is snake doctor, over.
base commander: Snake doctor, this is kilo-six-alpha.
sergeant wirth is alive.
I say again, sergeant wirth is alive.
base commander: Roger. Any other survivors, over?
negative. Require immediate medevac, over.
base commander: Be advised flight one is on the way, over.
Roger that. Snake doctor out.
how bad is it?
it's not so bad.
it'll be ok once I find the femoral artery.
Aah!
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
I know that hurts like the devil.
did you find it?
Yeah. Yeah, there it is.
Ugh! All right.
I got it.
the trouble is the artery's retracted.
I can't get a clamp on it.
so I have to apply pressure to keep the bleeding down.
you gotta put in your own i. v.
can you do that?
I'm saying that's the wrong phone number.
that's the number for the px.
and I'm saying his name is dr. Russ dominick, and he's at the pocatello va.
I know, but I can't call, sir.
Jeremy, this is ron cheals, one of our most honored veterans.
I understand, Mrs. Blane, but we have safeguards...
safeguards?
do I gotta see another doc?
Yes, and I can make you an appointment...
never mind.
Mrs. Blane, is he chewing them instead of swallowing them?
I don't get it.
there's a time-release coating on the pills.
if he's chewing them, or crushing up, it means he's not taking them for pain.
he's going for the hit.
they're going to start wondering where we are?
do I know him?
his daughter's married to earl baptiste in c squadron.
I remember earl.
I'd like to meet him.
all right.
Hank, this is ron cheals.
he served with my husband jonas.
hello. Hello.
you served with him in that particular organization?
Yes, sir, I did.
giorgio pass in the apennines, september 1944.
85th infantry. Yep.
amazing, isn't it? 60 years in one of these.
it's the other things that kill ya.
emphysema, in my case.
you here by yourself, hank?
most always. A lot of waiting.
Yeah, it gets pretty lonely where I am, too.
I'll disable the mortar.
wait. There's got to be 2 other guys somewhere.
I don't see anyone.
all right. I'll cover you.
snake doctor, this is...
get down!
dirt diver, this is snake doctor. Come in.
Mack: Snake doctor, this is dirt diver...
dirt diver, moreno, come in.
damn.
what? Your back.
Mack: This is dirt diver. Snake doctor, come in.
this is snake doctor. Over.
the mortar has been disabled.
things got a bit hinky, but I say again, the mortar has been disabled.
Roger that.
we're heading your way. Dirt diver out.
phone.
come again?
to call my wife.
all right.
put this around your head.
I know. I know.
there you go.
MOLLY: I called over, and everything's fine. Ruth will meet us.
we'll get there in time for the actual ceremony.
very kind of you, molly. Thank you.
so long, old soldier. I appreciate it.
been good talking to you.
MOLLY: You find a lot to talabout?
well, one generation cometh, another generation passeth away.
Hey. Hey!
what's this? Money?
I didn't do it for the money.
I wouldn't do this for no money in the world.
I gave you them pills.
Hey, I don't know what he's talking about.
l... I wouldn't sell anybody my prescription.
and you wouldn't either.
you take them pills. God knows you earned them.
you all right to drive?
what's that supposed to mean?
I mean, are you all right to drive?
I'm fine.
if you want to talk to jonas...
I'm ashamed you had to see that.
but I did see it.
if I don't... if I don't get...
if I don't take those pills, molly, I'm gonna be in a bad way.
after you take the pills, what are you gonna do?
what am I gonna do?
you can't go back to idaho like this.
ruth will leave you. Yes, she will.
stay here, get clean, take the job, and you have a chance.
but I can't let you take it if you're hopped up and stuck.
you have to tell me that will change, or I will tell jonas, and it will cost you the job.
come home now, ron. Please.
uh, miss.
think I figured out your problem.
my problem?
you ordered a rotation of two ads per hour between 4: 00 and 6: 00.
Yeah, that's drive-time.
Yeah, but on the base?
those are still duty times.
you don't want to run these ads when the guys are at work.
you want the single enlisted guys?
you got to run these on their down-time when they're in their bunks with the radio on or driving in their trucks going to get a beer, missing their girlfriends.
and you don't want to advertise cheap beer when you're selling them a fantasy.
your ad copy is a male voice, correct?
telling his guy friends about these hot chicks.
your sales manager said that...
well, yes, he's wrong.
the voice should be female. Mm-hmm.
telling 'em she's ready to make all their dreams come true.
listen.
you want to know what a woman truly wants?
I won't tell you.
I spend all my time "thinking about what you want.
what does a woman want?
we won't tell you, but we'll show you.
the erotic dancers at Lacey Lou's.
my friends are waiting for you right now.
what you think?
Oh, yeah, that one does it every time.
so keep listening, 'cause the missile is airborne.
more hits coming at you.
pretty good.
you can leave that with jeanine.
just "pretty good"?
did you know he was gonna cancel the account?
how many interns you got coming through here?
you expect them to quit?
can't quit if you're not hired.
I rewrote the ad.
told him I'd get him a more targeted rotation.
you know, you got a sales manager who isn't doing you any favors.
I'm the sales manager.
all right, then.
he also said he'd extend the buy on the condition that I read the copy.
says he likes my voice.
great.
you'll be the first intern to...
I want a 10% commission on all future sales against 200 a week guaranteed.
you still want the credit?
plus my full credits, yes.
well, what can I say?
how 'bout "agreed"?
[Sighs] Agreed. You know...
good. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some things to do.
damn.
they said it'd be just a few more minutes.
we're just waiting...
Ruthie, I think there's something that I need to say.
I'm quitting the pills.
why this time?
because I want to come back.
I want to take a job back here with the unit.
if they'll take me back, will you?
I don't know.
you...
I need time.
Ruth, don't go.
I need time to think.
I just wanted to tell you I think we have your music, sergeant major.
ruth told me about this one song you and your team always asked for when you were back from a mission.
the old shaker song about homecoming.
man: Ladies and gentlemen, the garrison commander.
fort griffith is proud to welcome you to the dedication of our very own...
ladies and gentlemen, please remain standing for the playing of our national anthem.
Jonas: Did you get through?
woman, on machine: Leave a message, and i'll call you back.
Hi, baby. It's me.
just wanted to hear your voice, say that I miss you.
can't wait to see you and the kids.
OK.
I love you so much.
dirt diver, this is snake doctor.
can you read me?
Mack: Roger, this is dirt diver.
dirt diver, you got company.
behind you. 9 o'clock.
I see 'em.
base commander: Snake doctor, this is kilo-six-alpha, over.
kilo-six-alpha, this is snake doctor.
control is showing us a sizable enemy contingent on the ridge at 4 o'clock.
you may want to direct your men over there, over.
my men have their hands full.
say again, over.
I said, my men...
radio check, over.
you're coming in broken and stupid.
Albright: Snake doctor, this is flight one, over.
flight one, this is snake doctor.
good to see you.
I'm gonna land on the far ridge where there's a plateau.
negative, flight one.
you need to land in the valley.
I have a man who's injured.
it's too dangerous.
you can't see what I can.
there are heavily armed men hostiles crawling out of the woodwork.
no, you're not hearing me.
if I move this man, he'll die.
we can't land in the valley.
we'll be sitting ducks out there.
you're gonna land in this valley, or by god I will shoot you out of the sky myself!
Roger that.
coming in hard and fast.
let's go!
forget them. Now.
let's go. We got to go now.
kilo-six-alpha, this is flight one.
base commander: This is kilo-six-alpha.
kilo-six-alpha. Over.
he's shot.
someone give me the kit now!
how's he doing?
stable... for now.
can't waste time getting to a hospital.
he's gone. Lost too much blood.
every call you made today was the right one, boss.
just bad juju.
I don't need my own team.
I want to be with you.
Leona: in yonder valley there grows sweet union, let us arise and drink our fill the winter's passed, and the spring appeareth the turtledove is in our land, in yonder valley there grows sweet union let us arise and drink our fill the winter's passed, and the spring appeareth, the turtledove is in our land in yonder valley, there grows sweet union, let us arise and drink our fill, in yonder valley there grows sweet union, let us arise and drink our fill
Wirth: Hi, baby. It's me.
just wanted to hear your voice, say that I miss you.
can't wait to see you and the kids. Ok.
I love you so much.
all right, now I need you over here.
you believe that no one can get past you, no one can get past you.
officer.
sir, sir.
sir, please, I must speak with your superior.
what's the... I have a message. It's life and death.
I know who you are.
you have been here 31 days to train the new troops for the democratic government.
I don't know what you think you...
your cover name is Daniel.
your call sign is whippoorwill.
what do you want?
I cannot say. Not to you.
please, I need to speak to the person of the highest rank, the American you are picking up in that car.
the person of the highest rank you're gonna speak to is right here. --Sir, please.
how 'bout you tell me... Mr. Daniel.
God bless America.
please, this is a misunderstanding.
what am I supposed to do?
MOLLY: Kim. They're towing my car.
Jonas: Well, that much we figured out. What's up?
it's all registered under bob's name, and without power of attorney I can't pay the bills.
didn't Bob give you... he did, but it expired.
he can only reinstate it himself, and he's out of town.
isn't Bob due back soon?
he offered to extend beyond 30 days.
to get the pay bump.
if I could just talk to him for five minutes, see how he wants me to handle this...
let me take care of it.
that's nice of you.
I can make some phone calls, try to get bob on the horn for you.
I'm in charge of the T. O.C. Tonight.
should be pretty quiet.
I will handle it.
I'm heading to the office, get some work done.
call me if you need anything.
thank you... both.
Hey.
Hey, what's the good word?
fella puts his spoon down on his napkin.
looks down at his bowl of chili.
lieutenant says, "Are you finished with that?"
man shakes his head.
lieutenant says, "well, then, do you mind?"
private pushes the bowl over to him.
lieutenant begins to eat.
all the way down to the bottom of the bowl, where he finds a dead mouse.
lieutenant throws up, all of it going back into the bowl.
private says, "Yeah, that's about as far as I got too."
you my second this evening, Kayla?
I am, sergeant major.
Jonas, Kayla. It's just Jonas.
otherwise we're gonna have a long night.
papua, new guinea?
we have a new task force... garden gate.
goes in tonight at 2200.
Tikrit?
joint task force rain barrel.
reports artillery firing in the region of Balal.
and following up on task forces Khandahar, Bali, Han river?
all reporting situation normal, unchanged.
good. Let's make a phone call.
when they answer, you talk first.
woman: All city trust.
Hello? Yes, can you hear me?
Yes. All city trust?
Yes, may I help you?
this is sergeant...
who am I speaking with?
this is Marissa. Marissa.
Marissa, I'm calling on behalf of an american fighting man overseas about some diddy-assed problem caused by you towing his vehicle away.
who is this? Who am I?
I'm general Eugene Bask.
I'm calling from the pentagon.
one minute, general, while I contact my supervisor.
so I want to know how... [woman translating]
how a civilian, a stranger, a man I have never in all my born days had knowledge of or played darts with, knows my name and call sign.
private Zemede. Yes, sir.
I am not here.
sir?
I am not a soldier. I am an advisor here to teach.
nothing more.
and what am I teaching you?
what am I training you to be?
a soldier, sir.
a warrior, defender of your new democracy, a fighter for the precious brand-new freedom that your family...
your wives and many children... may enjoy.
correction: Your several wives and girlfriends may enjoy.
and what does it take to be a soldier?
discipline.
the discipline not to shoot your mouths off.
I find out anyone, anyone has been talking on the outside about who I am or why I'm here, I will personally, so help me, I will personally see to it that he gets a job guarding a pumpkin patch.
now... show me how we keep our guest safe second he steps off that plane.
don't face me. Face out, damn it.
object is security, not face-time.
intruder, Mr. Daniel.
hold the line. Don't.
not till I give a command.
hold on. Hold your...
Yeah, get me the center.
I'm reporting a code four, four, alpha, india, juliet.
he's dying, Mr. Daniel.
Yeah, I would think so.
this is whippoorwill.
Jonas: No, I don't know sergeant Brown's mother's maiden name, and I will not be put on hold.
I don't understand.
why do you know these other...
because it is my business to know every other detail about sergeant Brown.
and I know a little bit about you too, Marissa.
that in fact you are calling me from Peshawar, India.
you cannot be sure of this.
shall I tell you the exact address and floor?
would you like to speak to a supervisor, sir?
Yes.
I would be happy to be connected to your superior.
in fact, why don't you find me the bank president?
one moment, sir.
whippoorwill.
this is Dog Patch.
snake doc, you minding the herd tonight?
moving us up to a two-level cipher.
my men just shot a guy coming at me with a steel pipe he used to pry a hole in the fence.
is he still alive?
he's in the final boarding process.
he's jabbering. He's not coherent.
no I. D. On him.
I'm sending you pictures and fingerprints though.
Kayla: Coming in now.
here's the thing.
subject approached me about a half hour before.
wanted to talk to my principal...
the guy we're picking up.
for the U. S. And southern hemisphere.
Yeah, that's the one.
look here.
this guy, he knew my cover name and call sign.
you've been compromised.
we should call the mission off?
Mr. Daniel.
my translator.
the man, the stranger dead.
dog Patch, subject just died.
means we'll get nothing from him now.
Jonas, it's a managing director, all city trust.
tell him he has to hold.
Mr...
whippoorwill, we're gonna tell your visitor not to land.
meantime...
co-director of the pentagon interagency high committee on finance.
dog Patch, this is whippoorwill. Out. [Beep]
as you know, our group is charged with approving and rating all financial services doing business with our troops.
you were talking to him.
what was he saying?
it... it was nonsense.
he said that, um, he was happy to be back home, back on his grandfather's farm.
this is Jonas Blane.
I'm looking to reroute the chairman's plane.
it's under the auspices of the state department.
Yes, I'd be happy to repeat.
the plane needs to be rerouted.
that can't be right.
get me Brown.
already got him.
whippoorwill, you there?
go.
you better be alone for this.
all right, I got some cover noise.
did you call off the chairman's plane?
I didn't call it off, and it ain't a chairman.
chairman's visit was a cover.
you're to escort another passenger arriving 0130 your time.
who is it?
u. S. Secretary of state.
you still there?
Yeah, yeah.
give me the chapter headings.
he's on his way to Riyadh.
this will be an unannounced layover doing a routine refuelg.
Jonas: He's gonna be meeting with the country's president.
secret summit under the cover of night.
they're counting on complete secrecy with this one.
cause you can't kill a guy if you don't know he's here.
Jonas, look, I can't vouch for his safety.
get me Tom Ryan on the phone.
your troops?
he's O. T.A.
my troops are...
he leave a number?
on leave. Call it.
a guy with a homemade weapon knew I was here.
Kayla: Eric White please. Room 137.
you listening?
you're the man on the ground. What's your read?
tell ,Mr. White it's about his children.
call it off. You agree?
it's forwarded.
I'll get back to you. Thanks.
Mr. White, it's Nancy. Please return.
get me the state department.
worldwide operations center.
their order explicitly states... now please.
see ya.
excuse me.
I was in here a few weeks ago, and I spoke to a man: Kyle.
I'm sorry, he's already gone home.
but my escrow closes tomorrow.
I've sold my home, but I haven't received the check.
Kyle didn't give you the check?
not Kyle. I decided to sell the home myself foolishly.
I couldn't afford it otherwise, but I found a new...
ma'am, we're closing for the day.
there's really very little I can do for you.
I understand.
thank you for your time, miss...
thank you.
your husband? Mm-hmm.
my husband Darryl brought me this back from Vietnam.
bronzed currency.
Yeah.
from a country no longer exists.
that's a nice piece of history.
your husband still in the military?
he's no longer with us.
tell you what.
sit down.
maybe I can advise you on your situation.
state acknowledges receipt of advisory from sergeants Blane and Brown.
can't it go any faster?
it's encrypted.
please be advised, threat does not...
repeat, does not... merit stand-down order.
proceed with mission as planned.
why would...
the secretary of state ignore our advice?
well, okay, because a...
to skip this meeting would threaten a fledgling democracy in africa and would weaken our position in the region.
and b?
because the man fancies himself a cowboy.
pull up the names of the officers working shift tonight at the pentagon operational watch.
Jonas, shouldn't we... I've already got it.
there.
I'm rear admiral Irwin Pettijohn, acting watch officer.
shunt this line.
make it look like it originated from room E-12, department of defense.
I can do that.
you're my assistant, lieutenant Myers.
you found a buyer for your home.
mark Harris. He's a realtor.
he negotiated the sale so I wouldn't have to pay fees to an escrow company.
I see.
he gave me a check for 10% up front and promised that i'd have the rest in time.
I mean, I've already put money down on the new house in minnesota.
is that sale contingent on selling your property here?
no. Means I'll lose the down payment, doesn't it?
I need your current address.
my business card.
do you have the title to your property?
Oh, yes, right here.
Linda's clip 'n' curl.
Yeah, I work from home.
you're a hairstylist?
for pets.
was something I could do no matter where Darryl was stationed.
you want to pay the bills as an army wife, you got to get creative.
you're preaching to the choir.
you say you sold your current property.
your buyer, this Mr. Harris...
he arranged the sale, but I just haven't gotten the final check.
Linda, you haven't received a check because nobody's bought your home.
mark said escrow's closed.
he hasn't even opened it.
why don't you give me Mr. Harris' phone number?
excuse me, are you...
mark Harris. Molly Blane?
I'm running late.
thank you for meeting me.
about Linda Kaplan...
it's my sale. You understand?
this is my find, and it's my sale.
you haven't bought it.
not yet, but I gave her the deposit.
you're delaying escrow long enough for the price to rise, find another buyer, and flip the property.
in the meantime you've got a poor lady in limbo.
what I'm doing isn't illegal.
it's immoral.
she's moving tomorrow.
you told her the property was sold.
what's your interest?
common decency.
is there no such thing as an innocent victim?
I can file a grievance.
look, this property is very valuable.
it's in a low-income housing str...
listen to what I'm saying.
Conway-Holtzblatt is planning on building a mall on that property.
it isn't public. I don't...
look, power and light just received an application from c-h to run 50 new power lines under that land.
the announcement won't be public for another month.
can check it out yourself.
doesn't change anything. Changes everything.
the value of that house just skyrocketed.
she's selling it for a song.
why not just buy the house yourself?
looks like you can afford it.
I don't have time for talk.
easier to sell it to someone else, get a hefty finder's fee for yourself.
don't file a grievance.
don't file it and i'll let you in.
damn right it's the admiral.
they're standing at attention, Kayla. I can hear them.
you tell him for me...
man: That information's been locked out, sir.
what do you mean it's locked out?
Kayla: It's Bob Brown.
brown: Dog Patch, you there?
we got a problem.
it's lieutenant Myers.
he's already landed.
they're telling me they can't interrupt traffic control.
Kayla: It's coded red. It's imperative that...
he gets off that plane.
you got to bluff him back on.
Mr. Secretary.
I just received a message from admiral Pettijohn,D.O.D. Operations. What is it?
it's coded red. Prompt response.
they want you back on that plane, sir.
man: What cipher they using?
what cipher they use to secure that line?
it was a 10-12-3-12. Don't have it on me.
both those expired two days ago. Didn't you re-key?
I re-keyed on the red cipher as per the date.
what is the red cipher? He's lying.
what is that message? Who are you?
Daniel, sir.
Daniel, you just screwed yourself out of a military career.
we will go forward as planned.
you will get me to this meeting.
and a further 150 million in direct military aid in return for a clear-cut timetable for the next elections.
go, Dog Patch.
we're trying to trace the identity of the attacker.
no hits on the fingerprints.
he spoke fluent english? Possibly american educated?
he had some American inflection.
no prints means he must have entered the country before september '01.
wearing a soccer jersey.
team logo?
San Francisco state. Won't mean much though.
there's secondhand american clothes everywhere.
they import it by the ton.
all we've got.
hold on.
follow car, what's that headlight?
says, "I don't know. He should not be there."
Jonas: What's the problem?
a headlight where there shouldn't be.
road's been blocked off.
all cars, pick up speed.
man: 66 degrees and partly cloudy...
I'd like to get paid in advance this month.
that's not how it usually works.
Where's Serena?
she's with her grandparents in Texas.
about getting paid?
I'm still waiting on that ad copy.
I wrote a couple different versions.
take your pick.
you have a gun.
you want to reconsider that advance?
Bob got me a permit for it.
is that loaded?
silly to carry it otherwise.
offend your sensibilities?
uh, just don't believe in 'em.
I'm more the poetic type.
you don't find a pistol poetic?
you ever hear of poetic justice?
okay. [Chuckles]
so then there's no sale?
no. There is good news.
I confirmed there are plans...
it doesn't matter, Molly.
I needed to move to Minnesota tomorrow.
Linda, listen to what I'm telling you, and think about your future.
I don't have a future. I'm sick.
I'm sick. It was detected late.
where?
it's ovarian.
I'm moving to Minnesota for the treatment.
I'm sorry.
I'm not looking for pity.
I'm only telling you so that you understand I have no concern for my future.
all that matters to me is tonight and tomorrow.
I may have a solution then.
Hey, Kim, I'm gonna go find an ATM.
you gonna get me that cash?
well, you need it, right?
and there's someone here to see you.
Jonas has a message.
he still can't put that call for you through to bob yet, but he's making some progress at getting your car back for you.
well, that's good of him.
you come out here just to tell me?
actually, I wanted to speak with you about our investment fund.
an opportunity...
an investment opportunity may have presented itself.
what?
it'd be taking advantage of a particular situation.
we'd also be helping someone, but it'd be taking some advantage.
but for us it would be very lucrative.
how?
I haven't consulted with the other wives.
it's your money too.
I can't...
Molly, when we started the investment club what we were doing was agreeing to trust you.
is this a good deal?
this is a great deal.
well, there you go then.
what's the plan here, soldier?
who the hell are they, and what are we doing to get some distance from them?
if you don't know, then get on that thing and ask someone.
there appears to be two men on the cycle.
their faces are covered.
get us out of here! Call someone.
sir, shut up.
follow to limo, the motorcycle is preparing to overtake.
he's passing on the right. Block him, follow.
throw open your doors.
follow, block them.
he says he thought the motorcycle was on the left.
he got confused, you ordered us not to.
dog Patch, this is whippoorwill. We've been attacked.
report.
principal is unharmed, repeat unharmed.
and the men?
training's broken down. They all went belly up.
they're like the rangers.
you give 'em a 5-minute break, they all need to be taught again.
you're the man on the ground.
give the orders.
the assassins turned tail and ran.
look, I've got no idea if they're gonna come back of if they got someone waiting up ahead.
Daniel, what do we do now?
Kayla: Routing through centcom. Office of the nsa.
put him through to the white house.
how the hell do I know? We're off the map.
he changed the route.
Jonas: Correct move. Thanks.
lead car, right, 150 meters ahead.
all cars follow.
Jonas: I got the U. S.S. Carl Vinson standing by off the coast.
... if we get there. Give me that line.
we can get a helo to you in less than three hours.
how do we do this?
ask the man in front.
we take the back roads.
use the scenic route. I kill anything that moves.
you got a question for me, Dog Patch?
your follow car also failed to respond?
Yes.
I got one more. Just yes or no.
your translator, elsabet, she learned her english in the U. S. far as you can tell?
Yes.
that is all.
get me the dossiers on Bob's crew.
right.
and find me what division san francisco state plays and what conference.
men's soccer.
but we just determined...
soccer players sometimes exchange jerseys.
trade shirts after a game.
if he didn't play for them, he might have played against.
find out for who.
wait.
now it's the president of all city trust.
he says he's willing to re-open brown's records if general Bask...
tell him the general's will have to call him back.
ktml, this is Kim.
man: I want to request a song.
I'm sorry, tonight's show was prerecorded.
tell me the song. Maybe we can get it in tomorrow night.
treat menice. Elvis presley.
you sound too young to be an elvis fan.
Yeah. My dad loved that song.
made my mom crazy though.
I don't see much of 'em anymore.
no?
I'm getting shipped out all the time and relocated.
I just got reassigned.
where to? Philippis.
know anything about it over there?
not much, but I know how it is to be on the other side of the world from the ones you love.
I'll bet your folks are thinking about you.
maybe.
treat me nice. That the one?
Yeah.
maybe I can play it here in the booth if you just want to listen.
that'd be really nice of you.
what's your name, soldier? Mike.
all right, Mike, let me find it for you.
Linda, I'd like to buy your home, but I have to be honest with you.
it's not a fair deal.
it isn't? For you.
there are plans for a mall on the site. I checked it out.
your property is very valuable, more valuable than you realize, more valuable than mark harris represented.
my friends and l... some of the wives on the base...
we have an investment club.
you deserve more for your home, and I wish I could offer you full-market value.
what I can offer is all we have.
it's more than what mark harris was going to give, but less than what the property is worth.
is it enough to close on the new home in minnesota so I don't lose the down payment?
more than enough.
that's all I care about.
you do understand...
Molly, you're doing me a favor.
San Francisco plays in division two in the California Collegiate Athletic Association.
go, Dog Patch.
Jonas: Restrict yourself to yes or no.
we've identified your dead john doe.
his name's Ammanuel Uday.
he earned an engineering degree from the University of California, San Diego, in 2000.
soccer scholarship.
returned to his homeland in 2003.
arrested by the former regime for pro-democracy political dissidence.
refusal to be conscripted in the army.
Yes.
Jonas: He also has a sister.
sponsored her coming over a couple of years behind him.
same school.
sister's your translator.
there's another party joining us on the line:
doctor Ghebre Michael, state's language school, east african division.
Dr. Michael: Good evening.
thank you, doctor.
Bob, you're gonna do two things.
first, you're gonna sign off.
make it look like you're turning off your phone, but leave it on speaker so we can hear what the others in the car are saying.
doctor Michael will translate. Got it?
Yes.
tell your drivers to reverse course.
give no explanation.
this is whippoorwill. Out.
all cars halt.
Dr. Michael: He's asking her, "what is he doing?"
and she says, "I don't know. Wait."
all cars, at my command, reverse.
ready.
now.
halt.
Dr. Michael: "Do you think he suspects?"
for the sake of god, don't do anything now.
there are two killers, and they're with you in the car.
lead car, doors open.
follow car, doors open.
follow driver, lead driver, exit your vehicle and approach.
drive. Go, go, go!
what the hell... sir, shut up, get down.
tell the truth now, or I will kill you.
I will shoot you.
the only reason you're alive is so you can tell the truth.
[Speaking foreign language] Shut up!
they forced me.
they told me if I didn't cooperate they would torture me again.
they tortured me and my brother.
your brother?
[Speaking foreign language] Shut up.
turn here.
the one who climbed the fence and got shot?
[crying] Yes. Oh, god, yes.
he was trying to warn you.
he loved America.
did you forget something, Rory?
excuse me, can l...
I'm Mike. Are you Kim?
Yes.
I found you.
you found me?
why were you looking for me?
you played me a song.
Oh, well, Mike.
Yes, you're welcome.
it was really nice what you did.
I didn't know you were pregnant.
if I'd known you were pregnant, I might not have come down here.
Mike, you don't move. I'm just gonna be a minute.
you know what I wish?
I wish that you were pregnant by me.
what?
I wish that you were pregnant by me.
well, I'm pregnant by my husband.
he's in the mps, my husband.
Uh-huh. There he is now.
that ain't you. That ain't you.
I heard you on the phone.
that's why I came down here.
you're gonna stay...
you're gonna stay in this damn chair, you hear me?
what did I tell you?
please. Please what?
please what? Please what?
I'm gonna tell you what I want you to do.
now, I know that a woman in your situation is very delicate, and I will respect that.
Mike, Mike, all right, all right.
why did you come down here?
just tell me why you came down.
your husband ain't here.
you're a soldier. You have a sense of honor.
you can do something honorable right now.
Mike: Shh, shh, shh.
no, no, I'm begging you. I have children.
I have a child.
she drew me a picture.
she's gonna show it to me when I come home.
please, I need to see her picture.
I need to see her face.
get away from her.
take it easy, man.
we were just having a conversation.
move away.
or what?
I'm gonna kill you, or you can leave.
you're okay. Here, sit down.
[crying] You let him go.
I'm sure his fingerprints are all over the place.
it's all right, it's all right.
it's all right, I'm gonna call the cops.
Jonas: This had to have come from up top.
from the defense ministry.
she says isaias was a plant along with some others.
plan was to stage an attack on a high-ranking american, blame it on terrorist muslim insurgencies.
it was the generals.
they wanted you to back a coup, overthrow the president, make them your allies in your war on terror.
has a ring of truth.
Daniel, I need to speak with washington.
Kayla: Jonas, how can we be sure she was coerced?
I pulled up her student records.
her real name's Hajdah.
she led antl-u. s. Protests on campus before heading back africa ahead of her brother.
whippoorwill.
I heard.
how you feeling?
better.
he's in custody.
guy's a suspect in half a dozen rapes in the past four months.
killed the last one.
you were lucky.
he came back.
Hello?
Bob: Hey.
Jonas said you needed to talk to me.
never mind. It was nothing.
in the grand scheme of things, it was really nothing.
your voice sounds strange. Everything all right?
fine. Everything's fine.
just... i just want you home and safe.
well, I love you. I'll see you soon.
love you too.
nice home.
be a mall before you know it.
good memories.
I usually just keep the bottom locked.
thank you.
well, I...
I guess I better get on the road.
I'll wire you the money.
you should have it by the time you arrive.
the house hasn't been swept.
it's full of cat hair, and...
I'll take care of it.
you take care of yourself.
here.
Linda, no.
it's a military token.
belongs with a military woman.
it's from a country no longer exists, but maybe it's still a nice piece of history.
piece of our history.
thank you.
state's reporting the secretary's plane's in the air en route to Riyadh.
any mention of disciplinary action?
for sergeant Brown? Or me.
clean as a whistle.
then that's a very good night's work.
Hey. Riyadh, Tigrinia, Italy.
keep a watch out on that.
it's colonel Ryan.
[beep] Betty blue. Sir.
Yeah, we had a leak in the dam, but I put my thumb in it.
no, not at all, sir.
we... we tried, but the kids are in bed and we put the dog out.
now, you get a good rest.
now, what I'm gonna do now that I'm queen for a day?
bust into the boss' office and get a hit of his schnapps.
you come along?
good morning.
it's J. Phillip Swain, president of all city trust.
and who are you?
Yes, this is colonel Wallace.
Mr. Swain, you're calling about the account of one Robert Brown.
Mr. Swain, my office at the pentagon takes...
Yes, sir, takes the financial welfare of our fighting men quite seriously.
you will?
major Carstairs, please note that all city trust will reinstate sergeant brown's account without prejudice.
one moment please. [Beep]
this is general James Booth.
who am I speaking with please?
Mr. Swain, I would take it as a personal favor...
Oh, no, no, no, I do understand that you are reinstating sergeant brown's credit rating.
I don't want it reinstated. I want it raised.
well, sir, the pentagon will take that most kindly in you.
thank you now. Bye-bye.
schnapps time.
can I help you?
Oh, the key is stuck.
excuse me? What are you doing here?
I'm just gonna clean up.
Why?
I just bought the house from Mrs. Kaplan.
Linda Kaplan does own this house.
I am Linda Kaplan, and I didn't sell it to you.
that's her. She's the one.
we've had her on our records for some time.
trouble is, she's awful good at disappearing.
but the money?
it's not in Minnesota.
we tracked the account where the money was wired.
it's an offshore account.
can't trace the exact location.
how do I get it back?
don't know that you can.
it wasn't mine.
if it wasn't yours, then whose was it?
it wasn't only mine.
it was entrusted to me by my friends.
it was all we had.
Hey, you.
I'm running a little late.
Yeah, I got home, couldn't help but notice.
didn't get everything finished last night.
everything at the T.O.C? It's fine.
everything's fine.
same here. Be home soon.
good. Love you.
well...
love you too.

is THAT A DIRECT ORDER, MR. PRESIDENT?
Yes, IT IS.
RAJA?
he FANCIES HIMSELF A GENERAL. WE DO NOT KNOW WHY.
he STUDIED ART HISTORY AT STANFORD.
he HAS SERVED IN NO KNOWN MILITARY,
and HE'D LIKE TO OVERTHROW THE DICTATORIAL REGIME
who KILLED HIS DADDY, THE KING.
he, UM, HE'S PASSED A MESSAGE ALONG TO ME.
says HE HAS ALL THE PIECES IN PLACE FOR A COUP,
just NEEDS AMERICAN SUPPORT.
now, THIS COULD BE A ONCE IN A GENERATION OPPORTUNITY FOR PEACEFUL REGIME CHANGE.
should IT BLOW UP,
we SHOW OUR HAND TO THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT,
it PUSHES THEM, MAYBE THE WHOLE REGION, TOWARD CHINA.
how 'BOUT THAT?
well, YOUR ADVISOR SURELY WOULD
Mm-mmm. MY ADVISORS HAVE NEVER MET RAJA.
the REPORTS THEY GIVE ME ARE BASED ON INTERVIEWS
with HIS CLASSMATES HAVEN'T SEEN THE MAN FOR 15 YEARS.
no, I NEED SOMEONE TO FIND HIM IN HIS HIDEY HOLE.
look HIM IN THE EYES, TELL ME WHAT HE'S MADE OF.
what IS HIS PLAN? WILL THIS PLAN WORK?
and LOOK AT YOU-- YOU'RE ALREADY GOING DOWN THERE.
you WANT ME TO VANISH OFF THE CENTER OF THIS PROTECTION DETAIL,
find RAJA IN COUNTRY, AND REPORT BACK TO YOU.

she's SUPPOSED TO BE DELIVERING
food AND MEDICINE TO EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS,
but SHE CAN'T RESIST CHEWING ON ANY HAWKISH BONE.

she MIGHT EVEN TRY TO CONTACT RAJA HERSELF.
you KEEP HER TO THE ITINERARY WE GAVE HER.
Yes, SIR.
one MORE THING.
my JOB AIN'T A BIT EASY.
but IT'S A HECK OF A LOT BETTER THAN GETTING SHOT AT.

sir.
MADALU Southeast Asia
Oh, LOVELY COUNTRY.

Ah, WHAT EXOTIC FLOWERS.
they CERTAINLY ARE.
Where's THE CARD?
ma'am?
the CARD THAT CAME WITH THE FLOWERS.
I COULD NOT SAY.
it WOULD BE A GRAVE DIPLOMATIC BREECH FOR SOMEONE IN THEIR GOVERNMENT
to CONFISCATE A PERSONAL COMMUNICATION.
which, IT FOLLOWS, LEAVES YOU AS THE CRIMINAL.
do YOU NEED TO SEARCH YOUR POCKETS?
or IS IT YOUR SINCEREST HOPE THAT I SEARCH THEM FOR YOU?
Mr. GREEN, SOME OF GENERAL RAJA'S SUPPORTERS WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO ME,
so YOU WILL ACCOMPANY ME TO A RESTAURANT THIS AFTERNOON.
ma'am...
you're NOT CLEAR TO LEAVE THE HOTEL TILL TOMORROW MORNING.
by WHOM?
that PYGMY 10-POT DICTATOR?
this IS A CHANCE FOR REAL DEMOCRACY.
democracy, WHICH CONTRARY TO RECENT WORLD OPINION, IS STILL A GOOD IDEA.
you WILL GET ME THERE TODAY.
I CAN'T GUARANTEE YOUR SAFETY.
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH GENERAL RAJA.
that DOESN'T ALTER THE CASE.
a MAN WITH OPINIONS.
ma'am, IT COULD BE A TRAP. WHY?
raja AND HIS FORCES,
or ANYONE ELSE TO DRAW YOU OUT.
Why? WHY WOULD THEY WISH TO DO THAT?
to KILL YOU, TO EMBARRASS THE GOVERNMENT.
perhaps YOU SHOULD JUST LEAVE THE POLITICS
to THE POLITICIANS, SOLDIER.
Yes, MA'AM. I AM A SOLDIER.
and IT IS MY MISSION TO KEEP YOU ALIVE.
you're SECURITY?
I AM THE PREMIERE'S HEAD OF SECURITY.
how MAY I HELP YOU, MADAME SENATOR?
I'll BE TRAVELING INTO THE CITY THIS AFTERNOON.
an UNPLANNED TRIP?
Ah, WELL, THAT'S CORRECT.
my SAFETY IS BEING GUARANTEED BY THESE MEN.
see, I'M THEIR FAIRY GODMOTHER WHEN IT'S TIME TO CUT THE CHECKS.
they're RETURNING THE FAVOR BY MAKING SURE I GET BACK HOME IN ONE PIECE.
all I EXPECT FROM YOU AND YOUR MEN
is COMPLETE PRIVACY.
will THAT BE A PROBLEM?
of COURSE NOT, MADAME SENATOR.
I've TAKEN CARE OF MY END.
the REST IS UP TO YOU.
you MUST TALK TO YOUR PRINCIPAL.
you UNDERSTAND I'M UNDER ORDERS?
I AM TO LOCATE AN APPROPRIATELY AUTHENTIC RESTAURANT FOR HER TO DINE.
our COUNTRIES MAY HAVE FEW MUTUAL INTERESTS,
but YOU AND I, WE BOTH WISH FOR THE SENATOR'S SAFETY.
naturally.
let ME SEND SOME MEN WITH YOU.
look, SHE WANTS TO MIX WITH THE LOCALS.
she WANTS TO HEAR THEIR STORIES OF THE EARTHQUAKE
and WHAT KIND OF AID IS MOST NEEDED,
and SHE WANTS NO INTERFERENCE.
a MAN OR TWO?
you UNDERSTAND THAT SHE HAS HAMSTRUNG ME?
the ONLY ALLY I HAVE LEFT IS SECRECY.
if NO ONE KNOWS WHERE SHE'S GOING,
there WILL BE NO ONE THERE TO MEET US TO DO HER HARM.
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND.
as SHE WISHES.
welcome.
my FRIEND SAID I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO STOP IN HERE FOR THE
the SOUP?
well, THAT'S RIGHT. THE SOUP.
your FRIENDS ARE ALSO AMERICAN?
they ARE.
it's DISAPPOINTING YOU ARE HERE ALONE, THEN.
unavoidable.
but THEY ASKED ME TO REPORT BACK TO THEM WITH ALL MY GOOD IMPRESSIONS.
let ME SAY WHAT THE COOK CAN PREPARE FOR SUCH A SPECIAL GUEST.
that WOULD BE LOVELY.
senator WEBB, I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST
you ALLOW SOME OF MY MEN TO ACCOMPANY YOU INTO TOWN,
as A MATTER OF SAFETY.
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN, BUT
this IS STILL OUR COUNTRY,
and I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY HERE AS WELL.
I REALLY MUST INSIST.
I'll ALLOW ONE MAN TO JOIN US.
one MAN UNDER MY ORDERS.
of COURSE.
if IT IS TO BE ONE MAN, IT SHALL BE ME.
very WELL.
is THIS HOW YOU TREAT THE VISITORS TO YOUR COUNTRY?
I JUST SERVE THE FOOD, MISTER, I DON'T COOK IT.
perhaps I SHOULD SPEAK TO PERSON THAT DOES, THEN.
please
no, I NEED TO SPEAK TO THE OWNER.
if YOU FEEL YOU MUST.
not HERE. THE WALLS ARE THIN.
no, NO, YOU STAY OUT HERE WITH HIM, WATCH THE ENTRANCE.
you ONLINE?
loud AND PROUD.
why DID YOU INVITE HIM?
give A MAN A FRONT ROW SEAT, HE DOESN'T GENERALLY ASK WHAT'S BEHIND THE CURTAIN.
I THOUGHT I MADE MY WISHES CLEAR.
leave THE POLITICKING TO YOU. YES, MA'AM.
welcome.
thank YOU.
that's ALL SHE WROTE.
all VISITORS GET THIS TYPE OF WORK?
take OFF YOUR CLOTHES.
you ALREADY SEARCHED ME.
take THEM OFF!
put THAT ON.
what IS THE DELAY?
maybe SOMEONE GOT SPOOKED.
maybe THIS WAS ALL A GAME.
I IMAGINE YOU DON'T GET STOOD UP VERY OFTEN.
not SINCE HENRY LATHAM IN THE 11th GRADE.
and WHERE IS HE NOW, RIGHT?
I NEED TO USE THE RESTROOM.
when IN ROME...
Hi, MOLLY,
Hi, KIM.
Jeremy. NEED US TO FIND CRYSTAL FOR YOU?
no, I CAN'T TALK LONG.
we're TRAVELING OUT SOON.
I NEED YOUR HELP.
sure, ANYTHING.
I'm ON A PLANE THERE IN 10 HOURS.
what's WRONG?
Hello? JEREMY?
Hello? I THINK THIS STORM'S GETTING WORSE.
can YOU HEAR ME? WHAT'S WRONG?
it's A SURPRISE. I'M GOING TO PROPOSE.
you're GONNA PROPOSE TO CRYSTAL!
I SEE!
Jeremy, THAT'S WONDERFUL.
can YOU HELP ME OUT?
I WON'T HAVE TIME TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS.
is THERE SOMETHING YOU CAN DO?
I'm SORRY, THERE'S MULTIPLE POWER OUTAGES REPORTED TO BISK RES.
and I HAVE TO GET CRYSTAL A RING,
any ONE SHE WANTS. YOU PICK ONE OUT.
of COURSE WE WILL.
and I NEED HELP MAKING ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS.
I WANT IT TO BE PERFECT FOR HER.
it WILL BE. WHAT DO YOU NEED?
I WANT TO GO TO THE--[STATIC]
to THE WHAT?
can WE GET HIM BACK?
we've GOT A LOT DO. IN NOT MUCH TIME.
how ARE WE GONNA FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF RING CRYSTAL'D LIKE?
sounds LIKE MAN'S WORK.
thank YOU. YEAH, ANY TIME.
senator?
senator?
senator, I'M COMING IN.
Betty BLUE. BETTY BLUE.
get IN HERE, SHE'S GONE. WHAT?
the YELLOW ROSE, SHE'S GONE. I REPEAT,
the YELLOW ROSE IS MISSING.
she WAS IN HERE, DOOR WAS NEVER OUT OF MY SIGHT.
wait.
hole WAS CUT RECENTLY.
who ELSE DID YOU TELL WE WERE HERE?
no ONE.
your MEN, THEY FOLLOWED YOU, THEY TRACKED YOU, WHICH IS IT?
No! WHERE IS SHE?
I DON'T KNOW.
who ARE YOU? WHERE AM I?
where HAVE YOU TAKEN ME?
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH?
this IS WAR.
you ARE DECLARING WAR ON A SUPER POWER!
Yes, COLONEL.
Yes.
he SAYS HE SAW NO ONE BACK HERE.
the SOONEST WE CAN HAVE MORE MEN HERE IS 12 HOURS.
I WANT YOUR ENTIRE ARMY HERE NOW.
where IS YOUR OTHER MAN? WHERE IS YOUR TEAM LEADER?
he HAD THE BACK.
he MUST HAVE BEEN NEUTRALIZED AS PART OF THE KIDNAPPING.
this WAS NOT US.
because THINGS ARE SO FRIENDLY BETWEEN OUR 2 NATIONS?
because SUCH AN ACT WOULD HARM US MORE THAN YOU.
as INDEED IT WILL.
I THOUGHT THE ENTIRE POINT OF A DICTATORSHIP
was TO EXERT CONTROL OVER ITS PEOPLE.
I THOUGHT-- THEN YOU EXERT THAT CONTROL.
my COLONEL WANTS OUR PRINCIPLE BACK.
get word out on the news.
offer a reward for her safe return.
the NEWS STATIONS WILL NOTIFY THE PEOPLE.
a REWARD WILL BE OFFERED.
what ARE YOU DOING NOW?
this AREA IS POPULAR WITH GENERAL RAJA'S SUPPORTERS.
I ASSURE YOU THIS ATROCITY WAS THEIR DOING NOT OURS.
for WHAT PURPOSE?
to BAIT YOU INTO ATTACKING OUR SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENT.
No! THIS SNATCH JOB TOOK INTEL AND PLANNING.
your PEOPLE ARE THE ONLY ONES
who KNEW THAT THE SENATOR WAS LEAVING THE HOTEL.
were WE?
the SENATOR'S TRIP WAS PURELY SOCIAL? IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD?
are YOU SURE SHE DIDN'T TRUST SOME OF RAJA'S PEOPLE?
your MAN RUNS THE GOVERNMENT,
allegedly WITH AN IRON FIST.
you're STANDING IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW,
so, I'M HOLDING YOU PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE.
do YOU KNOW WHAT MY COLONEL JUST INFORMED ME?
right NOW BOMBS ARE ROLLING OFF AN ASSEMBLY LINE IN OHIO
and BEING LOADED ONTO PLANES. GUESS WHERE THOSE PLANES ARE HEADED.
if YOU DON'T HELP ME FIND THE SENATOR SAFE AND PRISTINE
before THOSE BOMBS HIT YOUR AIRSPACE,
my SUPERIORS WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING
not NAILED DOWN BY GOD HIMSELF.
you THINK AN EARTHQUAKE DESTROYED YOUR COUNTRY, FRIEND?
let THE GOOD SENATOR DIE,
and SEE HOW THIS HOME OF YOURS STARTS ROCKIN'.
what DO YOU THINK?
I THINK IT'S PERFECT. WE'LL TAKE IT.
a LOVELY RING FOR A LOVELY COUPLE.
Oh, THANK YOU.
it's A LITTLE LATE TO BE BUYING YOUR WIFE AN ENGAGEMENT RING, DON'T YOU THINK?
well, YOU KNOW WE WERE TOO BROKE WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,
so I FIGURED IT'S TIME TO MAKE IT RIGHT.
well, TIFFY'S VERY LUCKY.
I JUST GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GIVE IT TO HER.
got ANYTHING PLANNED?
figure I'LL TAKE HER SOMEWHERE NICE.
well, YOU SHOULD TAKE HER SOME PLACE SPECIAL TO THE TWO OF YOU.
like?
well...
you AND JEREMY HAVE A PLACE?
Yes, WE DO.
what IS IT?
it's WHERE WE HAD OUR FIRST DATE.
I DON'T THINK IT'D SUIT YOU.
Why's THAT?
well, FOR STARTERS IT'S IN KALAMAZOO, MICHIGAN.
and FOR FINISHERS?
come ON, A SEVENTIES-THEM RESTAURANT.
Yep, SHAG CARPET, LAVA LAMPS--THE WORKS.
you're KIDDING.
waitress IN POLYESTER AND GO-GO BOOTS.
couldn't MAKE IT UP IF I TRIED.
Jeremy AND CRYSTAL ARE INTO THAT KIND A STUFF?
no. I THINK.
has SENTIMENTAL VALUE?
thank YOU.
I SPOKE TO THE TOURISM OFFICE IN KALAMAZOO.
Wow.
luckily THERE IS ONLY ONE SEVENTIES DINER IN THE AREA.
rainbow ROOM.
crystal WASN'T KIDDING. IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY.
Tiffy: IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER THAN THAT.
Jeremy GETS BACK TONIGHT.
it's WHAT CRYSTAL WANTS, WHAT WE PROMISED HIM.
JEREMY'LL UNDERSTAND. MOLLY, THERE'S NO TIME.
we WILL DO THIS.
uncover his eyes.
keep YOUR MOUTH SHUT.
good day, officer.
your paper.
who is he and where are you going?
to the bridge to finish our work.
he's hired help.
where are his papers?
he just arrived from Nigeria today.
I have four workers and an African with no papers.
8.0
we're backing up out here. Are you letting them through or not?
go ahead.
my ORDERS ARE 24 HOURS TO LOCATE THE SENATOR.
after THAT, WE'RE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY IN CASE BOMBING BECOMES NECESSARY.
you UNDERSTAND THE DEAL HERE?
every SOLDIER IN THE ARMY'S GOING DOOR TO DOOR IN THE CITY CONDUCTING SEARCHES
a BENEFIT OF OUR FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
no WARRANTS NECESSARY.
what ABOUT INTERROGATING YOUR OWN SECURITY OFFICERS?
as I SAID, WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.
well, THAT'S QUITE A BET YOU'RE PLACING.
that's HIS CHIPS IN THE POT.
we HAVE COLLECTED VARIOUS SUPPORTERS OF GENERAL RAJA'S CAUSE.
also, EMPLOYEES OF THE RESTAURANT.
I AM CONFIDENT ONE OF THEM WILL BE ABLE TO TELL US WHO HAS TAKEN YOUR SENATOR.
with YOUR PERMISSION, I WILL BEGIN AGGRESSIVE INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES
until ONE OF THEM REVEALS THE AUTHORS OF THIS CRIME.
torture?
you DO NOT NEED TO BE PRESENT IF IT MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE.
how HIGH IS THE REWARD YOU'VE OFFERED YOUR PEOPLE FOR THE SENATOR?
one MILLIONS RUPLES.
what IS THAT?
it IS A FORTUNE TO DREAM OF TO ALMOST EVERYONE ON THIS ISLAND.
well, I WOULD STRONGLY URGE YOU TO DREAM BIGGER.
keep an eye on them.
Molly, THERE'S NO WAY.
they're ONLY GETTING ENGAGED ONCE.
I SENT JEREMY OVER THERE.
the LEAST I CAN DO IS GIVE HIM A SPECIAL NIGHT.
Oh, WELL HOW SPECIAL IS IT GOING TO BE
if SHE FINDS ME AND THE OTHER WIVES TAPING CARPET TO HER PATIO?
just KEEP WORKING.
I'll BE HAPPY IF I NEVER SEE PINK OR GREEN CARPET AGAIN.
you AND THE REST OF THE WORLD KEEP WORKING.
crystal: HELLO. BYE.
Hi, BABY. HOW WAS SCHOOL?
fine.
Hi, CRYSTAL.
Hi. AUNT MOLLY, WANT TO SEE MY NEW DOLL HOUSE?
not NOW, BABY.
it HAS A CHANDELIER.
it DOES? WANT TO SEE?
later, BABY. GO PLAY.
OK.
crystal: WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE?
uh, THANK YOU GIFTS FOR THE F. R. G. FUNDRAISER.
I FOOLISHLY OFFERED TO STORE THEM IN MY LIVING ROOM.
Mmm. GENEROUS YOU.
don't YOU HAVE TO GET TO WORK?
actually, I'M THINKING OF CALLING IN SICK.
you're SICK?
no. BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG WEEK.
I THOUGHT I'D SPEND A QUIET NIGHT AT HOME.
but YOU HAVE TO GO TO WORK.
what? WHY?
because... BECAUSE...
because IT'S A MATTER OF RESPONSIBILITY.
well, IT'S JUST ONE NIGHT.
responsibility TO YOUR LOVED ONES IN THE FIELD.
what DO YOU MEAN?
save YOUR DAYS OFF FOR WHEN YOU CAN USE THEM WITH JEREMY.
who KNOWS WHEN HE'LL BE BACK.
you're RIGHT.
who IS THIS?
I'm HERE TO SEE GENERAL RAJA.
he WILL SEE THE SENATOR ONLY.
I DON'T SPEAK FOR THE SENATOR.
I'm HERE FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
general.
the PRESIDENT SENDS HIS GREETINGS.
before WE BEGIN,
I FEEL I MUST TELL YOU LOCAL RADIO IS REPORTING YOUR SENATOR HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED.
what?
I AM SORRY.
from WHERE? AND BY WHOM?
I DO NOT KNOW.
but I SWEAR TO YOU NEITHER I NOR MY ASSOCIATES HAVE DONE THIS.
if YOU CHOOSE TO LEAVE NOW TO SEARCH FOR HER,
you're FREE TO GO.
holy HELL!
you've GOT ONE HOUR TO CONVINCE ME 8
I TELL YOU EVERYTHING-- ALL MY PLANS.
I've JUST TOLD YOU HOW TO STOP ME.
how's IT GOING TO GO DOWN FOR YOU WITH U. S. SUPPORT?
we'll FOLLOW THE STRATEGIC MODEL SET UP BY THE VIET CONG.
the PRESIDENT TRAVELS ON THE 18th.
by SUNDOWN ON THE 19th, WE WILL CONTROL THE COUNTRY.
casualties? NONE.
Mm-hmm. AND THIS?
at THE HOUR OF THE COUP, WE WILL TAKE OVER ALL RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS.
Ah, THE OPPOSITION CAN'T REACT IF IT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.
we DON'T SIMPLY SHUT OFF THE BROADCASTS,
we TAKE CONTROL OF THE AIRWAVES-- ANNOUNCE SUCCESS.
announce THAT WE HAVE ALREADY SEIZED POWER. WHY?
world WANTS TO BE ON THE WINNING TEAM.
we SEIZE CONTROL OVER VILLAGES,
and THE VILLAGERS WILL FOLLOW.
a COUNTRY OF 14 MILLION.
looks LIKE YOU HAVE AT BEST 15% IN ARMS.
I NEED ONLY HAVE ACTIVE SUPPORT OF 15%
and THE ABILITY TO ESTABLISH POSITIVE CONTROL OVER 25.
general MAO.
you're A MILITARY HISTORIAN.
and I THOUGHT YOU WERE AN ART HISTORY MAJOR.
I STUDIED MILITARY STRATEGY DATING BACK TO ROME.
you DON'T WIN WARS READING BOOKS.
Yes.
this IS WHAT I'VE LEARNED, PRECISELY.
we've GOT 10, 000 OF THESE STOCKPILED.
but WE NEED MORE.
and WE NEED ECONOMIC AND MILITARY SUPPORT.
what IS YOUR PRESIDENT'S OFFER?
your COUNTRY IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE TO SECURE THESE THINGS.
china?
among MANY OTHER PLACES.
but, OF COURSE,
america IS MY FIRST CHOICE.
our CAMP IS FAR FROM CIVILIZATION,
but I THINK YOU MAY BE SURPRISED AT THE AMENITIES.
such AS?
my CHEF TRAINED AT THE CORDON BLEU.
to THE ACTIVE SUPPORT OF 15%.
I'm CURIOUS, GENERAL.
why YOU PREFER AMERICA TO THE CHINESE IN THIS MATTER.
certainly, THEY'RE THE CLOSER NEIGHBORS.
Ahh. MY ESTEEMED CHEF QUOT.
at COLLEGE IN YOUR COUNTRY, I SPENT 4 YEARS FALLING IN LOVE WITH AMERICA.
the GENERAL GRADUATED SUMMA CUM LAUDE.
your FATHER MUST HAVE BEEN PROUD.
my FATHER WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE.
once, WHEN THE CAMPUS WAS CELEBRATING A FOOTBALL VICTORY,
my FRIENDS AND I, WE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A STREETLIGHT.
someone SNAPPED A PHOTO. AND THE NEXT DAY IT APPEARED IN A NEWSPAPER.
my FATHER WAS FURIOUS.
he WAS TOO HARD ON YOU.
I THOUGHT SO.
until HE WAS MURDERED THE NEXT WEEK.
and MY FAMILY WAS CHASED INTO EXILE.
that MUST HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT.
21 YEARS OLD, A STUDENT IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
it WAS A DARK PERIOD.
but I WAS BORNE THROUGH IT BY DESTINY.
destiny?
do YOU KNOW WHAT THE NAME RAJA MEANS?
king, I BELIEVE.
you're WELL INFORMED.
these ARE CHAOTIC TIMES.
and THE MANDALUAN PEOPLE NEED A LEADER.
it IS MY BIRTHRIGHT,
and I INTEND TO FULFILL IT WITH OR WITHOUT AMERICAN AID.
on YOUR LIST THE REQUESTS,
I DON'T SEE ELECTION OFFICIALS OR BALLOT BOXES.
the MOST SUITABLE AID
would BE M4 SUBMACHINE GUNS
and C-130 TRANSPORT PLANES.
which YOU CAN PROVIDE THROUGH THE ANTI-TERRORISM ACTIVITIES FUND.
security FIRST.
then ELECTIONS.
Ahh. EXCELLENT.
foie GRAS WITH TRUFFLES.
how LONG HAS YOUR CHEF BEEN WITH YOU?
over A DECADE.
and HE TASTES EVERY DISH
I WON'T BE BETRAYED LIKE MY FATHER WAS.
I SEE.
the EMPEROR CLAUDIUS DIED FROM A PLATE OF TAINTED MUSHROOMS.
hmm. SO, TELL ME, MR. GREEN.
what WILL YOU REPORT BACK TO YOUR PRESIDENT?
that YOU'RE AN IMPECCABLE HOST.
Hey. I WENT TO 4 DIFFERENT PLACES BEFORE I FOUND THESE LAMPS.
I USED TO HAVE ONE OF THESE IN MY ROOM AS A TEENAGER.
feelin' DATED?
a LITTLE BIT.
you HAVE THE OUTFITS.
got 'EM. WE SHOULD GET MOVIN'.
I GOT TO GET BACK TO BLACKTHORN TO MEET JEREMY.
see YOU AT THE RAINBOW ROOM.
you ALL SET?
I CAN'T FIND THE RING.
you're SURE I WAS THE LAST ONE TO HAVE IT?
I'm POSITIVE. I WATCHED YOU PUT IT ON THE COUNTER.
well, IT'S NOT ON THE COUNTER.
why WOULD IT BE IN THERE?
I DON'T KNOW, KIM!
look, I PAID FOR THIS RING WITH MONEY THAT I DON'T HAVE.
so, I INTEND TO FIND IT.
Jeremy WILL PAY YOU BACK.
not IF HE DOESN'T GET IT.
well, I'LL PAY YOU BACK THEN.
with WHAT? I SEE.
I ASKED YOU FOR YOUR HELP.
I LOST THE RING. SO, IT'S MY FAULT.
look, FOR THE SAKE OF TIME,
let's SKIP PAST THE "I'M SORRY, YOU'RE SORRY.
and JUST FIND THE RING. HOW 'BOUT THAT?
where ELSE WERE YOU WORKING TODAY?
in THE LIVING ROOM.
Oh, NO. WHAT?
the F. R.G. FLOWER BASKETS. THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE.
every MISSION HAS ITS SACRIFICES. COME ON.
clock's RUNNIN'.
the PREMIER AGREES WITH YOUR RECOMMENDATION
and HAS INCREASED THE REWARD TO 100 MILLION RUPLES.
well, I SEE WISDOM ISN'T COMPLETELY ABSENT IN THESE PARTS.
however, HE SUGGESTS THAT WE PROCEED WITH THE INTERROGATIONS.
look, ONE LIE UNDER TORTURE COSTS US ABOUT 6 HOURS.
and I DON'T CARE TO BE MADE A PART OF HOW YOU ABUSE YOUR CITIZENS.
perhaps WE COULD GIVE THE REWARD AN HOUR.
if THERE'S NOTHING BY THEN,
then WE'LL LEAVE YOU TO LEARN WHAT YOU CAN.
Ugh! PLEASE, GOD, DON'T HURT ME. PLEASE.
thank YOU.
please.
yes
I believe I know where the missing American may be.
your MEN STAY BEHIND US. NO SHOOTING UNLESS WE FIRE FIRST.
we GOT HER!
no ONE ELSE IS HERE.
we GOT THE ONLY THING WE CAME FOR.
are YOU INJURED?
are YOU ALL RIGHT?
Yeah.
you SURE? YEAH.
OK. HERE WE GO.
please. OHH.
please JUST GET ME BACK TO THE HOTEL.
that's THE LAST OF THEM.
people WHO MADE DONATIONS WON'T GET MUCH OF A THANK YOU
unless THEY WANT SOME BITS OF SHREDDED PAPER.
no RING. BUT AT LEAST THEY'LL HAVE A HELL OF A STORY.
maybe YOU TOOK IT HOME.
I DIDN'T. MAYBE TIFFY TOOK IT WITH HER
she DIDN'T.
then, WHERE IS IT?!
is THERE ANY ROOM THAT WE HAVEN'T CHECKED?
Oh, THANK GOD.
little GIRLS, SHINY THINGS.
we WERE BORN WITH IT.
Oh, NO. NO.
no.
it's NOT TOO LATE. WHERE WOULD SHE HAVE PUT IT?
I DON'T KNOW. SHE'S 6.
well, WE MUST BE MISSING SOMETHING.
the CHANDELIER.
what?
dollhouses DON'T COME WITH CHANDELIERS.
at LEAST NOT THE KIND WE CAN AFFORD.
what IS THIS?
good EVENING. WELCOME TO THE RAINBOW ROOM.
right THIS WAY.
would YOU LIKE TO ORDER NOW?
or WOULD LIKE TO WAIT FOR THE OTHER MEMBER OF YOUR PARTY?
the OTHER?
have YOU GOT HIM?
not YET. IT'S CONNECTING NOW.
you're SURE HE WASN'T ON THAT FLIGHT?
I GOT HIM. NEVER MIND, THANK YOU.
Molly. WE'VE
Where's JEREMY EARHART? TELL ME HE WASN'T INVOLVED.
I'm SORRY.
no...
he WAS SUPPOSED-- HIS FLIGHT SHOULD HAVE ARRIVED ALREADY.
he's DUE HOME.
why DIDN'T YOU CALL ME EARLIER?
it's--it's BEEN CHAOS ALL DAY.
details ARE STILL COMING IN.
tell ME WHAT YOU KNOW.
executive JEREMY WAS DRIVING
there WAS AN ATTEMPT ON THE CAR.
Jeremy TOOK EVASIVE ACTION,
but THERE WAS A HEAD-ON COLLISION, SOME SHOTS. FIRE.
is HE...
we DON'T KNOW YET. HIS INJURIES ARE SEVERE.
he's BEEN BURNED.
how SEVERE?
it's BAD.
it's REAL BAD.
no, CRYSTAL.
it's MOLLY.
to YOUR SAFE HOMECOMING.
always WORTH DRINKING TO, SIR.
I HAVE TO THANK YOU FOR EXCEEDING MY EXPECTATIONS.
how's THAT, SIR?
the SENATOR'S KIDNAPPING. YOU GAVE ME A PRETEXT
to EITHER SUPPORT THE COUP, OR, IF I SIT OUT,
it's ALREADY MADE THE GOVERNMENT THERE A WHOLE LOT MORE OBEDIENT.
just TRYING TO KEEP THE FINE SENATOR OUT OF HARM'S WAY.
well, WELL DONE.
thank YOU.
so, DID YOU MEET WITH GENERAL RAJA?
Yes. EYE TO EYE?
soldier TO SOLDIER? YES.
does HE HAVE A PLAN? YES.
is IT A GOOD PLAN?
rock SOLID, SIR. THE GENERAL HAS ALL THE PIECES.
he JUST NEEDS SOME AMERICAN GLUE TO HOLD IT ALL TOGETHER.
and THE MAN-- HOW DID YOU FIND HIM?
smart. CHARISMATIC.
a LEADER. BUT?
I WOULDN'T GO HUNTING WITH HIM, SIR.
well, IT SEEMS LIKE I HAVE 2 CHOICES.
and THEIR NAMES ARE NOT GOOD AND BETTER.
seems TO ME THIS IS THE QUESTION. WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,
will HE STICK BY US OR WILL HE SELL US OUT TO THE CHINESE?
I AIN'T IN THE OFFICER CORPS, SIR.
no, BUT YOU LOOKED HIM IN THE EYE.
I LOOKED YOU IN THE EYE OVER A DRINK.
does HE SELL TO THE CHINESE?
only FOR A DOLLAR MORE.
he's NOT THEIR GEORGE WASHINGTON.
I'd SETTLE FOR WARREN HARDING.
there's ONE THING YOU FORGOT TO MENTION ABOUT MR. HARDING THE LAST TIME, SIR.
his MISTRESS.
he LATER FATHERED A CHILD WITH HER.
Ohh. YOU'RE A READING MAN.
speculation HAD IT THAT WHEN HARDING'S WIFE DISCOVERED THIS,
she POISONED HIM.
suppose THERE'S A LESSON THERE SOMEWHERE.
sir, WATCH YOUR 6.

marc granger, you're a reporter for the "washington tribune."
we're gonna take you home.
where exactly this t-1 line?
they deserve our help.
get a chest tube in me.
who's the doctor here?
he's unconscious.
scapula is broken up. Could have cut the artery.
Yeah, he's stable. And the package is secure.
you did it again. - All right. Let's go!
sniper!
get us out of here!
beirut, Lebanon
four shooters... heavy gun!
we're not gonna be able to shake 'em. Reloading!
I got to get out of here!
you talk, I will put a hood over your head and strap it down tight.
you got that? - Give me a hand grenade.
the next time we turn,I want you to shoot for the left side of that truck.
I want them to see tracers.
force them wide right.
Betty Blue, Hammerhead is gone.
hammerhead is dead!
you're gonna have to save yourself now.
breathe.
breathe.
keep your heart rate down.
I'm gonna lift your feet up. Why is that?
face is red, raise the head; face is pale, raise the tail.
right. What does that mean?
I got to keep the blood in my brain or I'm gonna die of shock.
now you're thinking.
what's your mission? - Stay alive, sir.
dog patch zero-six, this is snake doctor.
status report. - Send your reports.
one kilo, india, alpha...hammerhead.
whiskey, india, alpha...betty blue.
three ok.
snake doctor, say again. Casualties, over.
I say again, hammerhead is down.
sergeant medawar, alert graves registration.
pull the file on sergeant hector williams.
right away.
we are exfilling to the secondary extraction site.
confirm the beats.
snake doctor, do you have the precious cargo?
affirmative.
amigo, you know that we did not rescue you out of the kindness of our hearts.
what do you want?
you interviewed abu saeef, the butcher.
four months ago. - His location.
I don't remember... - yo're journalist. You're paid to remember things.
I don't know!
you see this man? Look at him.
he died for you.
and I kind of liked him.
and it's the butcher's people that did this.
now, I'm going to ask you one more time:
what is the location of the butcher?
they drove me to a building, 10 minutes from the commodore.
up a steep hill and then it got flat.
I heard airplanes right above us.
how close?
ten minutes from his hotel puts us in this radius.
planes approach the airport along this path.
the only hill with a direct line from the approach is here and a plateau here.
that's where the butcher was four months ago.
no, that's where he is now.
we checked with nsa. There's been chatter in that location.
we have a voice signature. And a possible visual here.
the butcher is 14 clicks out from here.
snake doctor, your job is done. Return to base.
I'm sending in the bravo team. They'll clean up the butcher.
no.
this is either a job for a thousand men or one.
snake doctor!
get him back.
there's no response.
a mr. Sack, sir, from the white house. - Which line?
everybody out.
I just lost a man on your mission.
now, we have a problem...and it's bigger than one man.
is that so?
this mission was covert, black in, black out. Your team screwed up.
that was the old plan. Welcome to the new one.
UPI is going with a story that american forces rescued a hostage in Beirut.
the white house denies american forces were involved because we weren't involved.
do you read me?
your team needs to be out of Beirut now.
we got the location on the butcher.
let's go get him. - No.
get in the boat.
you can't go there alone. - One man.
I'm not gonna tell your wife I've lost another.
you want me to tell your wife? Your wife is tougher than my wife.
get in.
I'll see you in Cyprus.
American? - Citizen of the world.
my password is salma.
Oh, that's not today's password. - That's my password.
and what does it mean? - Beautiful woman.
what took you so long?
I wasn't going to kill you up until right now.
I have something your boss wants.
forward Base, Cyprus
how did we get here, buddy?
if we'd left from the south exit, we could have covered the rooftops for snipers.
if we'd flanked the truck...
don't bother. It's not worth the time.
I don't want any toe-taggers touching his body.
one of your men never showed... jonas blane.
is that so?
well, here's how I square it... either you purposefully lied to me or your man's gone rogue.
these are my choices?
did you order your man back in? - I did.
is there a reason you neglected to tell me? - Operational security.
I have a-16 clearance. - How happy you must be.
I have the clearance. - Then you know what the mission was:
rescue the hostage, see if he can lead us to abu the butcher.
get this blane character the hell out of there.
we lost radio contact. - How is that possible?
I told him to shoot the radio.
I'm telling you that I'm not wearing a saddle, so stay off my ass.
you've got some loose ends. - And what might those be?
the journalist.
your little secret operation's going to end up on cnn. - I've got a check-rein on it.
you'd best have.
the president is going on national television tonight to announce his mid-east peace accord.
he calls it his legacy.
so if you can't change that reporter's mind, the saddle's going on.
you're wounded. - It's not my blood.
how is he? - Somebody did some heroic field surgery.
a bullet that close to his artery. Which one of you?
well, your friend is going to make it.
he's in pain but stable enough to be medevaced home.
you look like a rock star.
drugged up and strung out.
looks good on you, dude.
they're going to medevac you. - Where's hector?
he's right behind you. - Then I'm staying.
we're going to get you home.
Hector's on his way.
there's a concern about loose ends.
I understand what i have to do, colonel.
the journalist was not rescued by Americans.
no, sir. - Tell me what you need.
well, he's been stockholmed... thinks that we're the bad guys.
so I'm going to need a couple days to put his head back where it belongs.
18 hours, he's being fed to a press conference.
and if we can't break him down? - Mack will stay with Williams' body.
get it clean. We're running play 16.
Roger that.
Colonel, any word from snake doctor? - No.
I'm not going to hurt you.
I do something for you.
you do something for me. And I need your help.
no, I'm not doing anything for you.
I'm an American. And I'm a journalist. I've got rights. You can't hold me.
nobody knows you're here.
as far as the world knows, you're dead inside a prison or dead in a ditch.
there's going to be a press conference.
at that press conference, we need you to say that there were no Americans involved in your rescue.
no. No. I'm not going to lie.
we saved your life. One of our men died for you.
no, I did not ask you to come in - and kick down doors and shoot innocent people. - Your captors were going to kill you.
they told me they weren't going to kill me. - They lied to you.
they killed 11 hostages before you.
they are terrorists.
now, maybe you think that the butcher is a deeply misunderstood man, but let me tell you something. He kills Americans.
I got pictures. You want to see them?
four months in that prison, man. I know they tortured you.
I know it. I've been tortured. I know what that's like.
they forced you to say things, they forced you to believe things.
I get it. - And now...
and now you want me to lie. - No.
no. I want you to understand the stakes to which you expose us and the next American in trouble...
the next granger that we are tasked with getting out.
I tell the truth.
you're a journalist.
that's right.
OK, tell me, have you ever had to slant a story in order to get to a deeper truth?
no. - You're a liar.
you've lost weight. - You just never saw me in this shirt.
you somehow have gotten uglier.
you want me to shoot him?
give him back his guns.
and these guns...
made in America.
long way from home.
I need your help.
and what are you offering me?
the butcher's head.
the butcher can't be found. - And yet I did it.
I'm half-blind and rolling in money.
I am the enemy of your enemy.
and thus I call you friend.
and you want your friend to do your dirty work? - No.
I do your dirty work. - And what's your plan?
a bomb?
I need a garage, welding supplies, and a few of your men.
And?
when I'm done, you can drag the butcher through the streets.
grey's stable, but he's still in a lot of pain.
he's landing at 17ï¼00.
when can we see him?
doc says he'll be out in a week. - And hector...
we all know the drill, and I thank you all for your help.
I don't think I'm the best person.
these are the orders.
Hector's family?
I gave his parents your address.
they're gonna come by and collect hector's key.
I'll tell Annie. - How close were they?
he wanted to marry her. - Did she know what his work was?
she was ex-army...two tours.
she didn't hear the words, but she knew.
Annie, I...
I have news about hector...
bad news.
Annie, he's gone.
