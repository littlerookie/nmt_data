the garage.
that's where i work. Yeah.
no, i-I-I've got the day off.
[ Chuckles ] good thing.
that lawn looks like it could use some mowing.
you want to mow the lawn?
are you kidding me? I'd love to mow the lawn.
knock yourself out.
you'd think you've never mowed a lawn in your life.
I don't believe it.
Ugh! Jessica.
good to see you, too, dean.
I can't breathe, okay?
Hey, look at you.
you're with jessica. I don't believe it.
Yeah.
Where'd you guys come from?
we just flew in from california.
California. Stanford, huh?
law school, i bet.
that's why we're here.
don't tell me you forgot.
well...
Wow. That looks awesome.
all right. To mom.
happy birthday. Happy birthday.
thank you.
I was really worried about you last night.
Oh, i'm good.
I'm really good.
okay.
what do you say later we get you a cheeseburger?
Oh, god, yes.
how did i end up with such a cool chick?
I just got low standards.
uh, you want to tell them?
they're your family.
all right. What?
tell me what?
Oh, my god!
that's so wonderful. Thank you.
Congratulations.
I just wish your dad were here.
Yeah, me, too.
congratulations, sammy.
Thanks.
I'm really glad you're happy.
so, dean, what was all that back at the restaurant?
Oh, i thought i saw someone.
I'm sure it's nothing.
well, i had a lovely birthday.
thank you.
good night. Night.
Yeah, well, i'm beat.
ready to turn in?
sure.
night, guys.
wait a second. Wait a second.
come on. It's not even 9: 00 yet.
let's go have a drink or something.
Yeah. Yeah, maybe another time.
come on, man. Look at us, huh?
we both have beautiful women on our arms.
you're engaged.
let's go celebrate.
guys, can you excuse us? I want to talk to my brother for a sec.
sure. Thanks.
come on, carmen.
come here.
what?
okay.
what's gotten into you?
what do you mean?
I mean this whole warm, fuzzy, ecstasy-Trip thing.
I'm just happy for you, sammy.
Yeah, right. That's another thing.
since when do you call me "sammy"?
Dean, come on.
we don't talk outside of holidays.
we don't?
well, we should. I mean, you're my brother.
you're my brother"?
Yeah.
that's what you said when you snaked my atm card
or when you bailed on my graduation
or when you hooked up with rachel nave.
who?
uh, my prom date -- On prom night.
Yeah, that does kind of sound like me.
well, hey, man, i'm sorry about all that.
no, look, it's all right, man.
I just -- You know, i'm not asking you to change.
I just, uh -- I don't know.
I guess we just don't really have anything in common,
you know?
wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yes, we do.
Yes, we do.
what? Hunting.
hunting?
I've never been hunting in my life, dean.
Yeah, well, then we should go sometime.
I think you'd be great at it.
get some rest.
my favorite.
I guess you know me pretty well.
afraid so.
you all right?
Sammy and i -- We don't get along.
well, you don't really spend a lot of time together.
I just think you don't know each other all that well.
for the record, he doesn't know what he's missing.
I can fix things with sam.
I can make it up to him...
to everyone.
okay.
what's gotten into you lately?
this isn't gonna make a lick of sense to you.
but i kind of feel like i've been given a second chance.
and i don't want to waste it.
you're right. It doesn't make any sense.
you know, i get it.
get what?
why you're the one.
well?
whatever's gotten into you, i like it.
Oh, come on!
don't do this to me now. I've got to get ready for work.
you got to work now?
I told you.
I've got the night shift on thursday.
you work nights at the, uh...
...hospital.
I'm dating a nurse.
that is so respectable.
Oh, no. I stopped that crash.
everyone that you saved, everyone sammy and i saved...
...they're all dead.
and there's this woman that's haunting me.
I don't know why.
I don't know what the connection is -- Not yet, anyway.
it's like my old life is coming after me or something,
like it doesn't want me to be happy.
of course, i know what you'd say.
well, not the you that played softball,
but you'd say, "go hunt the jinn.
it put you here. It can put you back.
your happiness or all those people's lives -- No contest.
right?
but why?
why is it my job to save these people?
why do i have to be some kind of hero?
what about us, huh?
what, mom's not supposed to live her life?
Sammy's not supposed to get married?
why do we have to sacrifice everything, dad?
it's...
Yeah.
that was so easy i'm embarrassed for you.
what the hell are you doing here?
I was looking for a beer.
in the china cabinet?
that's mom's silver.
what, you broke into the house to steal mom's silver?
it's not what it looks like, okay? I didn't have a choice.
Oh, really? Why?
what's so damn important
that you got to steal from your own mother?
you want the truth?
Yeah. Yeah, i do.
I owe somebody money.
who?
a bookie. I lost big on a game.
I got to bring him the cash tonight.
I can't believe we're even related.
Sam, i'm sorry.
I'm sorry that we don't get along.
and i wish to hell i could stay and fix it.
but i got to do this.
people's lives depend on it.
what are you talking about, dean?
nothing. Forget it.
just, uh...
Hey, tell mom i love her.
I'll see you, sammy.
get out of the car. I'm going with you.
you're just gonna slow me down. Tough.
this is dangerous, and you could get hurt. And so could you.
Sam -- Look, whatever stupid thing you're about to do,
you're not doing it alone, and that's that.
I don't understand. Why are you doing this?
because you're still my brother.
bitch.
W-what are you calling me a bitch for?
you're supposed to say "jerk.
what? Never mind.
[ sighs ] what's in the bag?
nothing.
nothing? Yeah, nothing.
fine.
you don't want to do that. Oh, really?
what the hell is this? Blood.
Yeah, i can see that it's blood.
what the hell is it doing in here?
you don't really want to know.
no, i do really want to know.
I really, really do.
well, you're gonna find out sooner or later.
I needed a silver knife dipped in lamb's blood.
you needed a silver knife dipped in lamb's blood. Why?
because there's this creature, a jinn, and i have to hunt it.
okay, um, stop the car.
I know how it sounds. Great.
just stop the car.
it's the truth, sam.
there are things out there in the dark.
there are bad things.
there are nightmare things.
and people have to be saved,
and if we don't save them, then nobody will.
I want to help you. I really, really do.
but you're having some kind of psychotic breakdown,
so i just
I wish.
what the hell was that, dean? That was my phone.
I'm not going to a rubber room, sammy,
and we got work to do.
I was just trying to help you out, dean.
I don't want you to get yourself hurt.
you protect me?
Yeah! Oh, that's hilarious.
why don't you just sit tight
and try not to get us both killed?
where are we?
well, we're not in kansas anymore.
Illinois. Illinois
and you think something's in there?
I know it is.
see?
there's nothing here, dean.
look, carmen's got to be worried sick about you, dean.
come on. Let's just go.
what the hell is that?
stick behind me and keep your mouth shut.
what the hell?
it's her.
Dean, what's going on? Shh.
Where's my dad?
no.
no.
Where's my dad?
sleep.
sleep.
this is real?
you're not crazy?
she didn't know where she was.
she thought she was with her father.
what if that's what the jinn does?
it doesn't grant you a wish.
it just makes you think it has.
look, man, that thing could come back, all right?
Dean, please.
what if i'm like her?
what if i'm tied up in here someplace?
what if all this is in my head?
I mean, it could, you know
maybe it gives us some kind of supernatural acid
and then just feeds on us slow.
no, dean, that doesn't make sense, okay?
what if that's why she keeps appearing to me?
she's not a spirit.
it's like more and more i'm catching flashes of reality
you know, like i'm in here somewhere, i'm catatonic,
and i'm taking all this stuff in, but i can't snap out of it.
okay. Look. Yeah, you're right. I was wrong.
you're not crazy, but we need to get out of here fast.
I don't think you're real.
did you feel that?
you feel this? I'm real. This is not an acid trip.
I'm real,
and that thing is gonna come down here and kill us for real.
now, please. There's one way to be sure.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
what are you doing?
it's an old wives' tale.
if you're about to die in a dream, you'll wake up.
no, no, no. That's crazy, all right?
maybe.
you're gonna kill yours-- Or i'm gonna wake up.
one or the other.
look, this isn't a dream, all right?
I'm here with you now,
and you are about to kill yourself, dean.
???
...like 90% sure,
but i'm sure enough.
wait!
why'd you have to keep digging?
why couldn't you have left well enough alone?
you were happy.
put the knife down, honey.
you're not real.
none of it is.
it doesn't matter.
it's still better than anything you had.
what?
it's everything you want.
we're a family again.
let's go home.
I'll die.
the jinn will drain the life out of me in a couple of days.
but in here, with us,
it'll feel like years, like a lifetime.
I promise.
no more pain, no more fear.
just love and comfort and safety.
stay with us.
get some rest.
Jessica: you don't have to worry about sam anymore.
you get to watch him live a full life.
we can have a future together, have our own family.
I love you, dean.
please.
why is it our job to save everyone?
haven't we done enough?
I'm begging you.
give me the knife.
I'm sorry.
Oh, god. Come on.
Hey, wake up.
wake up, damn it.
Hey. Hey.
thank god.
I thought i lost you for a second.
you almost did.
Oh, god.
let's get you down.
she's still alive.
I got you.
I got you. We're gonna get you out of here, okay?
I got you.
I got you.
okay.
uh, well, thank you so much for the update.
okay, bye.
that was the hospital. The girl's been stabilized.
good chance she's gonna pull through.
that's good.
Yeah.
how about you? You all right?
Yeah, i'm all right.
you should have seen it, sam.
our lives.
you were such a wussy.
so, we didn't get along, then, huh?
no.
Yeah.
I thought it was supposed to be this perfect fantasy.
it wasn't.
it was just a wish.
I wished for mom to live.
mom never died, we never went hunting,
and you and me just never, uh -- You know.
Yeah.
well, i'm glad we do.
and i'm glad you dug yourself out, dean.
most people wouldn't have had the strength. They would've stayed.
Yeah, lucky me.
I got to tell you, though, man
you had jess.
mom was gonna have grandkids.
Yeah, but, dean, it wasn't real.
I know.
but i wanted to stay.
I wanted to stay so bad.
I mean, ever since dad...
all i can think about is how much this job's cost us.
we've lost so much.
and we've sacrificed so much.
but people are alive because of you.
it's worth it, dean. It is.
it's not fair,
and, you know, it hurts like hell,
but it's worth it.
dad's gone now.
he wants us to pick up where he left off.
what do you say we kill some evil sons of bitches and we raise a little hell?
then
bela talbot's her real name, which means seriously bad luck for you.
- Pretty freaking far from a hunter.
I procure unique items for a select clientele.
I think you'll find that belongs to me.
you're not gonna shoot anybody.
the hell is wrong with you?!
I'm busting my ass trying to keep you alive, dean, and you act like you couldn't care less.
truth is, I'm tired, sam.
I don't know. It's like there's a light at the end of the tunnel.
it's hellfire, dean. - Whatever.
you're my big brother.
there's nothing I wouldn't do for you.
and I don't care what it takes. I'm gonna get you out of this.
well, what can I do for you, sam?
you can let dean out of his deal right now.
I'm just a saleswoman. I got a boss, like everybody.
he holds the contract.
and who's your boss? - I can't tell you.
I'm sorry, sam, but there's no way out of this one.
so, I've been waiting since maple springs. You got something to tell me?
it's not your birthday. - No.
happy purim?
dude, I don't know. I have no idea what you're talking
there's a bullet missing from the colt.
you want to tell me how that happened?
I know it wasn't me. So unless you were shooting at some incredibly evil cans...
Dean. - you went after her, didn't you?
the crossroads demon. After I told you not to.
Yeah, well...
you could have gotten yourself killed! - I didn'T.
and you shot her.
she was a smartass.
so, what? Does that I'an m out of my deal?
don't you think I might have mentioned that little fact, dean?
no.
someone else holds the contract. - Who?
she wouldn't say.
well, we should find out who.
of course, our best lead would be the crossroads demon.
Oh, wait a minute...
that's not funny. - No, it's not!
it was a stupid freaking risk, and you shouldn't have done it.
I shouldn't have done it?
you're my brother, dean.
and no matter what you do, I'm gonna try and save you.
and I'm sure as hell not gonna apologize for it, all right?
red Sky At Moring
but I don't understand.
I already went over all this with the other detectives.
right, yes. But, see, we're with the sheriff's department, not the police department --different departments.
so, mrs. Case...
please. Ms. Case.
okay. Um, ms. Case, um...
you were the one who found your niece, correct?
I came home, she was in the shower.
drowned? - So the coroner says.
now, you tell me, how can someone drown in the shower?
how would you descbe sheila's behavior in the days before her death?
I mean, did she seem frightened?
maybe she said something out of the ordinary?
wait a minute.
you're working with alex, aren't you?
Yep. Absolutely.
Alex and us, we're like this.
why didn't you say so?
Alex has been such a comfort.
but I'm sorry. I thought the case was solved.
well, no. No, not yet.
I see.
so, anyways, we were talking about your niece.
well, yes.
Sheila mentioned something quite strange before she died.
she said she saw a boat. - A boat?
Yes. One minute it was there, then it was gone.
it just disappeared right before her eyes.
you think it could be a ghost ship?
Alex thinks it could be a ghost ship.
well, uh...
...Could be.
well...
you let me know if there's anything else I can do for you.
anything at all.
what a crazy, old broad.
Why? Because she believes in ghosts?
look at you. Sticking up for your girlfriend. You cougar hound.
bite me.
not if she bites you first.
so, who's this alex? We got another player in town?
maybe, maybe not. Doesn't change our job.
and what looked like a ghost ship, right?
Yeah. It's not the first one sighted around here, either.
Really? - yeah.
every 37 years, like clockwork, reports of a vanishing three-mast clipper ship out in the bay.
and every 37 years, a rash of weirdo, dry-land drownings.
so, whatever's happening is just getting started.
Yeah. - What's the lore?
well, there are apparitions of old wrecks sighted all over the world.
the S. S. Violet, the griffin, the flying dutchman
almost all of them are death omens.
so, you see the ship and then a few hours later, you pucker up and kiss your ass goodbye?
basically.
what's next stEp?
I got to I. D. The boat.
that shouldn't be too hard.
I mean, how many three-mast clipper ships have wrecked off the coast?
I checked that too, actually. Over 150.
Wow. - Yeah.
crap.
this is where we parked the car, right?
I thought so.
Where's my car?
did you feed the meter?
Yes, I fed the meter.
Sam, where's my car? Somebody stole my car!
Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.
I am calmed down! Somebody stole my ca
Oh, dean. hey, hey, hey, Take it easy.
the '67 impala? Was that yours?
I'm sorry. I had that car towed.
you what?!
well, it was in a tow-away zone. - No, it wasn't!
it was when I finished with it.
what the hell are you even doing here?
a little yachtG.
you're alex.
you're working with that old lady.
gert's a dear old friend.
Yeah, right. What's your angle?
there's no angle.
there's a lot of lovely old women like gert up and down the eastern seaboard.
I sell them charms, perform seances so they can commune with their dead cats.
and let me guess, it's all a con.
the comfort I provide them is very real.
how do you sleep at night?
on silk sheets, rolling naked in money.
really, sam, I'd expect the attitude from him. But you?
you shot me. - I barely grazed you.
cute. But a bit of a drama queen, yeah?
you do know what's going on around here. This ghost-ship thing, it is real.
I'm aware.
thanks for telling gert the case wasn't solved, by the way.
it isn'T. - She didn't know that.
now the old bag's stopped payment and she's demanding some real answers.
Look...just stay out of my way before you cause any more trouble.
I'd get to that car if I were you...
before they find the arsenal in the trunk.
Ciao.
can I shoot her?
not in public.
Hello?
no.
the police said that he drowned, but I don't u-understand how...
I am so sorry for your loss, mr. Warren.
now, if you could just tell me one more time about the ship your brother saw.
ma'am, I think this man's been through quite enough. You should go.
but I just have a few more questions. - No, you don'T.
thank you for your time.
sorry you had to deal with that. They're like roaches.
so, we heard you say your brother saw a ship.
Yeah, that's right.
did he tell you what it looked like?
it was, uh... like the old yankee clippers.
a smuggling vessel.
the rakish topsail, a barkentine rigging. Angel figurehead on the bow.
that's a lot of detail for a ship your brother saw.
my brother and i were night diving.
I saw the ship, too.
excuse me, officers, I'm not sure those men are detectives.
all right. Well, we'll be in touch. - Thank you.
I see you got your car back.
you really want to come near me when I got a loaded gun in my hands?
now, now. Mind your blood pressure.
why are you even still here?
you have enough to I. D. The boat?
that guy back there saw the ship.
yeah? And?
and he's going to die, so we have to save him.
how sweet.
you think this is funny?
he's cannon fodder.
he can't be saved in time, and you know it.
Yeah, well, see, we have souls, so we're gonna try.
well, I'm actually gonna find the ship and put an end to this.
but you have fun.
Hey, bela, how'd you get like this, huh?
what, did daddy not give you enough hugs or something?
I don't know. Your daddy give you enough?
don't you dare look down your nose at me.
you're not better than I am.
we help people. - Come on.
you do this out of vengeance and obsession.
you're a stone's throw from being a serial killer.
whereas I, on the other hand, I get paid to do a job and I do it.
so, you tell me -- which is healthier?
bela, why don't you just leave? We've got work to do.
Yeah. You're 0 for 2. Bang-up job so far.
anything good?
no. Not really.
I mean, both brothers are duke university grads.
no criminal record.
I mean, a few speeding tickets.
they inherited their father's real estate fortune six years ago.
how much? - $112 million.
nice life. - Yeah.
I mean, nice, clean, aboveboard.
so, why did they see the ship?
why sheila, too? What do they all have in common?
maybe nothing.
no. There's always something.
Hey, you!
I think we've been made.
what are you guys doing?! You watching me?!
sir, calm down. Please.
you guys aren't cops!
not dressed like that. Not -- not in that crappy car.
whoa, hey. No need to get nasty.
we are cops, okay? We're undercover.
we're here because we think you're in danger. - From who?!
if you just settle down, we'll talk about it.
look, you guys just stay away from me!
wait.
Hey, you moron! We're trying to help you!
that can't be good. - No.
get the salt gun.
s
you want to say it, or should I?
what?
you can't save everybody, sam.
Yeah, right. So -- so, what? You feel better now or what?
no. Not really. - Me neither.
you got to under-- - it's just lately I feel like I can't save anybody.
dear god...
are you actually squatting?
charming.
so, how did things go last night with peter?
that well, huh?
if you say "I told you so," I swear to god, I'll start swinging.
look, I think the three of us should have a heart-to-heart.
that's assuming you have a heart.
Dean, please.
I'm sorry about what I said before, okay?
I come bearing gifts.
such as?
I've I. D.'D the ship.
in 1859, a sailor was accused of treason.
he was tried aboard ship in a kangaroo court and hanged. He was 37.
which would explain the 37-year cycle.
aren't you a sharp tack? There's a photo of him somewhere.
here.
isn't that the customer we saw last night?
you saw him?
Yeah, that's him. Except he was missing a hand.
his right hand. - How did you know?
the sailor's body was cremated, but not before they cut off his hand to make a hand of glory.
a hand of glory?
I think I got one of those at the end of my thai massage last week.
Dean, the right hand of a hanged man is a serious occult object.
it's very powerful. - So they say.
and officially counts as remains.
none of this explains why the ghost is choosing these victims.
I'll tell you why.
who cares?
find the hand, burn it, and stop the bloody thing.
I don't get it. Why are you telling us all this?
because I know exactly where the hand is.
where?
at the sea pines museum.
it's a macabre bit of maritime history.
but I need help. - What kind of help?
what is taking so long? Sam's already halfway there.
with his date.
I'm so not okay with this.
what are you, a woman?
come down, already.
all right. Get it out. I look ridiculous.
not exactly the word I'd use.
what?
you know, when this is over, we should really have angry sex.
don't objectify me.
let's go.
sea pines marttime museum
are you chewing gum?
try to behave as if you've lived this life before. Yeah?
this will get their tongues wagging, eh, my adonis?
just remember, we're on business.
Oh, but sometimes business can be pleasure, hmm?
right.
you know, uh, could you excuse me for a moment?
great. Thanks. Thanks.
exactly how long do you expect me to entertain my date?
as long as it takes.
look, there's security all over this place, all right?
this is an uncrashable party without gert's invitation, so...
we can crash anything, dean. - Yeah, I know.
but this is easier, and it's a lot more entertaining.
you know there are limits to what I'll do, right?
Aw, he's playing hard-to-get. That's cute.
come on.
I want all the details in the morning.
thank you
to us.
private security? - I don't think so.
look at the way they're standing. They're pros.
probably state troopers moonlighting.
posted to every door, too.
Yeah. I don't think we're gonna be able to just waltz upstairs.
what do you suggest?
I'm thinking.
don't strain yourself.
interesting, how the legend is so much more than the man.
you got any bright ideas, I'm all ears.
okay.
honey? Honey? Are you all right?
waiter...
Hi, uh, my wife has a severe shellfish allergy. There's no crab in that?
no, sir. - No?
Oh, they're excellent, by the way.
what seems to be the trouble?
uh, the champagne.
my wife -- she's a lightweight when it comes to the sauce.
is there somewhere I can lay her down till she gets her sea legs back?
follow me. - Right.
thank you.
come on, you lush.
you think she's a pain in the ass now, try living with her.
thank you very much.
Hey, maybe next time give me a little heads-up with your plan.
I didn't want you thinking. You're not very good at that.
Oh, look at you.
searching for a witty rejoinder?
screw yo very oscar wilde.
room 235.
it's in a locked glass case wired for alarm.
I'm sure that won't be a problem.
Where's alex and your friend? They're missing a great party.
I'm, uh -- I'm sure they're entertaining themselves.
naughty.
then I guess we'll just have to entertain ourselves.
whoa. Uh...
y-you know, um, mrs. Case...
Ooh, ooh, ooh. - I'm sorry.
ms. Case, I don't want to give you the wrong idea.
call me gert.
okay.
you remind me of my late husband. He was shy, too.
till we got belowdeck.
you're just firm all over.
sir? Ma'am? Everything all right?
Hi.
feeling better, I see?
Yes. Much. Thank you.
so if you're...done with the room?
well, not exactly. Could we have a few more minutes?
uh, yes, ma'am.
stop it. That tickles.
sorry. It's, uh... nature called.
thanks for looking after my wife.
Oh, she's being looked after, all right.
any trouble? - Nothing I couldn't handle.
the hand?
may I? - No.
it might be more inconspicuous in my purse. - Nice try.
just trying to be helpful.
well, sweetheart, I don't need your kind of help.
man, this is one long song.
I hope it never ends.
how's the investigation going?
these things take time.
people are talking about the warren brothers' deaths.
strange.
do you think it's connected to sheila's?
Yeah. Yeah, we think so.
I think they had it coming, you know, in a biblical sort of way.
what do you mean?
you know about their father.
no.
come here. I'll whisper it to you.
uh... -people say...
that the old man didn't die of natural causes.
then how?
rumor is the boys did it.
nothing was ever proved, but people still whisper.
O-okay, okay. So, did -- did sheila have any connection to them?
well, none that I know of.
did sheila have any kind of tragedy in her life?
Yes.
as a matter of fact, there was a car accident when she was a teenager.
what happened?
her car flipped over.
well, she was okay, but her cousin brian was killed.
Why? Is that important?
well...having a nice time?
he's delightful.
he wants me.
I'm going to get gert into a cold shower.
great idea.
see you at the cemetery.
you stink like sex.
you got it, right?
tell me I didn't get groped all night by mrs. Havisham for nothing.
I got it. Mrs. Who?
never mind. Just let me see it.
what?
I'm gonna kill her.
Oh, no.
you know what? You're right.
I'm not gonna kill her.
I think slow torture's the way to go.
Dean, look, you got to relax. -Relax?! Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'll relax.
I can't believe she got another one over on us!
you.
what?
I-I mean, she got one over on you, not us.
thank you, sam! It's very helpful!
Hello? Could you open up?
just let me explain.
I sold it. I had a buyer lined up as soon as I knew it existed.
so, the whole reason for us going to the charity ball was...
I needed a cover.
you were convenient.
look, you sold it to a buyer. Just go buy it back.
it's halfway across the ocean. I can't get it back in time.
in time for what?
what's going on with you, bela? You look like you've seen a ghost.
I saw the ship.
you what?
wow, you know, I-I knew you were an immoral, thieving, con-artist bitch, but just when I thought my opinion of you couldn't get any lower...
what are you talking about?
we figured out the spirit's motive.
this is the captain of our ship, the one who hung our ghost boy.
so?
so, they were brothers.
very cain and abel.
so, now our spirit, he's going after a very specific kind of target
people who've spilled their own family's blood.
see, first, there was sheila, who killed her cousin in a car accident.
and the warren brothers, who murdered their father for the inheritance.
and now you.
my god.
so, who was it, bela? Hmm?
who'd you kill?
was it daddy? Your little sis, maybe?
it's none of your business. - No.
right.
well, have a nice life -- you know, whatever's left of it.
Sam, let's go.
you can't just leave me here.
watch us.
please.
I need your help.
our help?
well, now, how could a couple of serial killers possibly help you?
okay, that was a bit harsh, I admit it. But it doesn't warrant a death sentence.
that's not why you're gonna die.
what did you do, bela?
you wouldn't understand. No one did.
never mind.
I'll just do what I've always done. I'll deal with it myself.
you do realize you just sold the only thing that could save your life.
I'm aware.
well...
...maybe not the only thing.
do you really think this is gonna work?
almost definitely not.
Sammy, you better start reading.
stay close!
behind you!
Sam, read faster!
You...hanged me!
I'm sorry.
your own brother!
I'm so sorry.
you boys should learn to lock your doors. Anyone could just barge in.
anyone just did.
did you come to say goodbye or thank you?
I've come to settle affairs.
giving the spirit what he really wanted -- his own very clever, sam.
so here
it's $10, 000. That should cover it.
I don't like being in anyone's debt.
so, ponying up 10 grand is easier for you than a simple thank you?
you're so damaged.
takes one to know one.
goodbye, lads.
she got style. You got to give her that.
I suppose.
you know, dean, we don't know where this money's been.
no...
...but I know where it's going.
ha ha!
Seriously? Atlantic city?
hell yeah.
play some roulette. Always bet on black.
Hey, listen, I've been doing some thinking.
um, I want you to know I understand why you did it.
I understand why you went after the crossroads demon.
you know, situation was reversed, I guess I'd have done the same thing.
I mean, I'm not blind.
I see what you're going through with this whole deal
me going away and all that.
but you're gonna be okay.
you think so. - Yeah. You'll keep hunting.
know you, you'll live your life.
you're stronger than me. You are.
you are. You'll get over it.
but I want you to know I'm sorry. I'm sorry for putting you through all this.
you know what, dean? Go screw yourself.
what? - I don't want an apology from you.
and by the way, I'm a big boy now. I can take care of myself.
Oh, well, excuse me.
so would you please quit worrying about me?
that's the whole problem in the first place! I don't want you to worry about me, dean.
I want you to worry about you.
I want you to give a crap that you're dying!
so, that's it? Nothing else to say for you?
I think maybe I'll play craps.
look, dad's gone now.
we have to carry out his legacy.
and that means hunting down as many evil sons of bitches as we possibly can.
then
if you want to stick around for a while, you're welcome to stay.
I can'T. I got a lot of work to do, and it's not my life.
bela talbot's her real name.
I unocure ique items for a select clientele.
a thief. - A great thief.
Sam, you want to break dean free of that demon deal, you ain't gonna find the answer in no book.
then where, bobby? - Kid, I wish I knew.
I've been busting my ass trying to keep you alive, dean, and you act like you couldn't care less.
I don't want you to worry about me, dean. I want you to worry about you.
I want you to give a crap that you're dying.
every damn demon, they were all human once?
every one I've ever met.
the answer is yes, by the way
the same thing will happen to you.
there's no way of saving me from the pit, is there?
no.
now
Oh. I'm sorry.
sir?
wake up.
wake up. Wake up! You hear me?
wake up!
sir, wake up! Help!
I need some help in here!
dream a little dream of me there you are. What are you doing?
having a drink.
it's 2: 00 in the afternoon. Drinking whiskey?
I drink whiskey all the time. - No, you don'T.
what's the big deal? You get sloppy in bars.
you hit on chicks all the time. Why can't I?
it's kind of slim pickings around here.
what's going on with you?
I tried, dean.
to do what?
to save you.
can I get a whiskey? Double, neat.
I'm serious, dean. - No, you're drunk.
I mean, where you're going... what you're gonna become.
I can't stop it.
I'm starting to think maybe even ruby can't stop it.
but, really, the thing is, no one can save you.
what I've been telling you. - No, that's not what I mean.
I mean, no one can save you because you don't want to be saved.
I mean, how can you care so little about yourself?
what's wrong with you?
Hello?
Yes, this is mr. Snyderson.
what?
where?
so, what's the diagnosis?
we've tested everything we can think to test. He seems perfectly healthy.
except that he's comatose.
Mr. Snyderson, you're his emergency contact. Anything we should know?
any illnesses? - No, he never gets sick.
I mean, he doesn't even catch a cold.
doctor, is there anything you can do?
look, I'm sorry, but we don't know what's causing it, so we don't know how to treat it.
he just...
went to sleep and didn't wake up.
so, what was bobby doing in pittsburgh?
I don't know, unless he was taking an extremely lame vacation.
I mean, he must have been working a job, right?
well, you think there'd be some sort of sign of something, you know?
Research...news clippings.
a friggin' pizza box or a beer can.
how about this?
good old bobby - always covering up his tracks.
you make heads or tails of any of this?
silene capensis," which, of course, means absolutely nothing to me.
here - obit.
Dr. Walter gregg, 64, university neurologist.
how'd he bite it? - Um, actually, they don't know.
they say he just went to sleep and didn't wake up.
that sound familiar to you?
all right, um...
so, let's say bobby was looking into the doc's death, you know, hunting after something...
that started hunting him. - Yeah.
all right, stay here. See if you can make heads or tails of this.
what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna look into the good doctor myself.
so, you're dr. Gregg's lab assistant.
that's right.
well, his death must have come as a shock to you.
Yeah, it did.
but, still, go in your sleep, peaceful - it's what you wish for, right?
Yeah, right.
Dr. Gregg, uh, studied sleeping disorders? Dreams?
I don't understand. I went over all of this with the other detective.
you already spoke to another detective?
Yes, a very nice older man with a beard.
well, I'd love to hear it again, if you don't mind.
thing is, I'm sort of busy. Maybe we could do this later?
sure. Yeah.
I'll just bring you down to the station later this afternoon and get your statement on tape, do it all official-like.
look, okay, I didn't know about dr. Gregg'sexperiments- not until I was cleaning out his files.
his experiments - the ones he was conducting on sleeping?
no one knew, okay? Not the university, not anybody.
I already spoke with a lawyer, and he told me that I can't be held liable for anything.
maybe you couldn't, but that was before the new evidence came to light.
new evidence?
what new evidence?
I'm not at liberty to say.
look, I'm just a grad student. This was a gig to cover tuition.
maybe so, but, still, this - this - this could go on your permanent record.
unless you hand over the doctor's research to me - all of it.
look, I don't know what the R. A. Said, but, uh, I was growing ferns.
take it easy, phish. That's not why I'm here.
Really?
Oh, thank god. Okay.
I want to talk to you about dr. Gregg's sleep study.
Yeah. Dr. Gregg just died, right?
you were one of his test subjects, right? - Yeah.
unless you're on duty or whatever.
I guess I can make an exception.
now, dr. Gregg was testing treatments for a charcot-wilbrand syndrome, which means...
um, I, uh, I can't dream.
I had this bike accident when I was a kid, and I banged my head pretty good, and I haven't had a dream since.
till the study...uh, sort of.
What'd the doc give you? - It's this yellow tea.
it smelled awful - tasted worse.
what did it do? - Just passed right out.
and I had the most vivid, super-intense dream.
like a bad acid trip, you know? - Totally.
I mean, no. - That was it.
I dropped out of his study right after that. I didn'T...like it.
to tell you the truth...
it kind of scared me.
how is he?
no change. What you got?
well, considering what you told me about the doc's experiments, bobby's wall is starting to make a hell of a lot more sense.
how so? - This plant, silene capensis, also known as african dream root, it's been used by shamen and medicine men for centuries.
let me guess - they dose up, bust out the didgeridoos, and start kicking around the hacky.
not quite.
if you believe the legends, it's used for dream-walking.
I mean, entering another person's dreams, poking around in their heads.
I take it we believe the legends. - When don't we?
but dream-walking is just the tip of the iceberg. - What do you mean?
I mean, this dream root is some serious mojo.
you take enough of it, with enough practice, you can become a regular freddy krueger.
you can control anything.
you could turn bad dreams good. You could turn good dreams bad.
and killing people in their sleep.
for example.
so, let's say this doc was testing the stuff on his patients tim leary-style.
somebody gets pissed at him, decides to give him a little dream visit, he goes nighty-night.
but what about bobby?
I mean, if the killer came after him, how come he's still alive?
I don't know.
help me!
somebody help me! Help me!
so, how do we find our homicidal little sandman? - It could be anyone.
yeah? - Yeah.
anyone who knew the doctor, had access to his dream shrooms.
maybe one of his test subjects or something?
possible, but his research is pretty sketchy.
I mean, we don't know how many subjects he had or who all of them were.
what?
in any other case, we'd be calling bobby and asking him for help right now.
know what? You're right.
what? - Let's go talk to him.
sure. I think we might find the conversation a bit one-sided.
not if we're tripping on some dream root.
what? - You heard me.
you want to go dream-walking inside bobby's head?
Yeah, why not? Maybe we could help.
we have no idea what's crawling around in there.
how bad could it be? - Bad.
dude, it's bobby.
Yeah, you're right.
one problem, though - we're fresh out of african dream root.
so unless you know someone who can score some...
crap. - What?
crap.
you're actually suggesting we ask her for a favor?
I'm feeling dirty just thinking about it, but yeah.
Hey, sam.
I didn't think there was a chance in hell you'd show up.
well, I'm full of surprises.
though, truthfully, you want to know why I'm here?
okay.
because of you.
uh, what are you doing?
I can't stop thinking about you. - What?
are you sure?
Sam, wake up!
dude, you were out.
and making some serious happy noises. Who were you dreaming about?
what? No one. Nothing.
come on. You can tell me. Angelina jolie?
no.
Brad pitt? - No! No.
dude, it doesn't matter. - Whatever.
whatever.
I called bela.
bela? Yeah?
w- what'd she, you know, y?
she's... gonna... help us?
shockingly, no, which puts us back to square one.
I've been trying to decipher the doctor's notes.
unfortunately, he has worse handwriting than you do.
you gonna come help me with this stuff?
Yeah, yeah. Just give me a sec.
bela, as I live and breathe.
you called me, remember?
I remember you turning me down.
well, I'm just full of surprises.
Hey, bela. What's going on?
I brought you your african dream root.
nasty stuff. And not easy to come by.
why the sudden change of heart?
what, I can't do you a little favor every now and again?
no, you're not.
now, come on. I want to know what the strings are before you attach 'em.
you said this was for bobby singer, right?
well, I'm doing it for him, not you.
Bobby? Why?
he saved my life once...in flagstaff.
I screwed up, and he saved me, okay? Are you satisfied?
maybe.
so, when do we go on this little magical mystery tour?
Oh, you're not going anywhere.
I don't trust you enough to let you in my car, much less bobby's head.
no offense.
none taken.
it's 2: 00 A. M. Where am I supposed to go?
get a room.
Oh, they got the magic fingers, a little "casa erotica" on pay-per-view. You'll love it.
you...
nice to - s-seeing you...
well, shall we dim the lights and sync up "wizard of oz" and "dark side of the moon"?
Why?
what did you do during college?
wait, wait, wait. Whew.
can't forget this.
here.
what the hell is that? - Bobby's hair.
we have to drink bobby's hair?
that's how you control whose dream you're entering. You got to drink some of their, uh...
some of their body.
well, guess the hair of the dog's better than other parts of the body.
bottoms up. - Yeah.
feel anything?
no.
you feel anything?
no.
maybe we got some bad schwag.
Hey, when did it start raining?
when did it start raining upside down?
okay, I don't know what's weirder - the fact that we're in bobby's head or that he's dreaming of better homes and gardens.
wait. Wait a second. Imagine the place without the paint job, more cluttered, dusty, books all over the place.
it's bobby's house. - Yeah.
I'm gonna go look outside. - No, no, no. Stay close.
dude, I'll be fine. Just look around in here.
look, we got to find him.
don't do anything stupid.
who's out there?
Bobby, you in there?
Dean? - Yeah, it's me. Open up.
Hey.
how the hell did you find me?
Sam and I got our hands on some of that dream-root stuff.
dream root? What?
Dr. Gregg - the experiments?
what the hell are you talking about?
hurry.
what's going on? - She's coming.
okay, you know this is a dream, don't you?
w- what, are you crazy?
it's a dream, bobby. None of this is real.
does that look made up?
no.
Bobby, who is that?
She's...she's my wife.
why, bobby?
why did you do this to me?
I'd have rather died myself than hurt you.
but you did hurt me.
you shoved that knife into me...
again and again.
you watched me bleed...watched me die.
Bobby, she's not real.
how could you?
you were possessed, baby. You were rabid.
and I didn't know what I know now.
I didn't know how to save you.
you're lying. You wanted me dead.
if you'd loved me, you would have found a way!
I'm sorry. - Come on.
who are you? - Who are you?
you don't belong here.
you're one to talk. You're in my friend's head.
well, you got a poor choice in friends. This is self-defense. He came after me.
h- he wanted to hurt me.
that may be because you're a killer.
you should be nicer to me.
in here, you're just an insect. I'm a god.
I'm telling you - all of it, your house, your wife - it's a nightmare.
I killed her.
this is your dream. You can wake up.
hell, you can do anything.
just leave me alone. Let her kill me already.
look at me. Look at me.
you got to snap out of this now. You got to snap out of this now!
you're not gonna die. I'm not gonna let you die.
I'm not gonna let you die. You're like a father to me.
you got to believe me. Please!
I'm dreaming? - Yes! Now, take control of it!
I don't believe it.
believe it.
now, would you please wake up?
sweet dreams.
Hey, bobby...
that, uh, that stuff - all that stuff with your wife...
... that actually happen?
everybody got into hunting somehow.
I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry.
if it weren't for you, I'd still be lost in there...or dead.
thank you.
so, uh, stoner boy wasn't in his dorm. My guess is he's long gone by now.
he ain't much of a stoner. - No?
no. His name's jeremy frost - full-on genius - 160 I. Q.
which is saying something, considering his dad took a baseball bat to his head.
here's father of the year.
he died before jeremy was 10. - Looks like a real sweetheart.
injury gave him charcot-wilbrand. He hasn't dreamt since.
till he started dosing the dream drug. - Yep.
how did he know how to dig up your worst nightmare and throw it at you?
Hey, he was rooting around in my skull. God knows what he saw in there.
Yeah, how'd he get in there in the first place?
isn't he supposed to have some of your hair, your dna, or something?
Yeah. - Yeah.
before I knew it was him, he offered me a beer.
I drank it. Dumbest friggin' thing.
Oh, I don't know. It wasn't that dumb.
Dean, you didn'T.
I was thirsty. - That's great.
now he can come after either one of you.
well, now we just have to find him first.
we better work fast... and coffee up.
cause the one thing we cannot do is fall asleep.
two days later
I mean, this jeremy guy's not a friggin' ghost. Where the hell could he be?
Dean, you sure you don't want me to drive? You - you seem a little...caffeinated.
well, thanks for the news flash, edison!
jeez.
tell me you got something!
the strip club was a bust, huh? - Yeah.
that was our last lead. - What the hell, bobby?!
don't yell at me, boy. I'm working my ass off here.
sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just - I'm - I'm tired.
well, who ain't? - What's bela got?
what do you got, bela? - Sorry.
sometimes the spirit world's in a chatty mood, and sometimes it isn'T.
she's got nothing. - Great!
well, I'm just gonna go blow my brains out now!
let me ask you something.
what are you doing helping us?
Bobby, I'm surprised you don't remember.
Flagstaff?
Oh. Yeah. Right.
Flagstaff.
all right, that's it. I'm done.
what are you doing? - Taking myself a long-overdue nap.
what? Dean, jeremy can come after you.
that's the idea. - Excuse me?
come on, man. We can't find him, so let him come to me.
on his own turf - where he's basically a god?
I can handle it.
not alone you can'T.
what are you doing? - Coming in with you.
no, you're not. - Why not?
at least then, it'll be two against one.
cause I don't want you digging around in my head.
too bad.
for the love of god.
what are we still doing here?
I have no idea.
there's someone out there.
stars shining bright above you night breezes seem to whisper "I love you
Hey.
you gonna sit down?
come on.
we only have an hour before we have to pick ben up from baseball.
say nighty-night and kiss me
I've never had this dream before.
just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me stop looking at me like that.
sorry.
I love you.
Where'd she go?
okay.
Hey, dean.
well, aren't you a handsome son of a gun.
we need to talk.
I get it. I get it.
I'm my own worst nightmare. That it? Huh?
like the "superman iii" junkyard scene - - a little mano y mano with myself?
joke all you want, smartass.
but you can't lie to me. I know the truth.
I know how dead you areinside...
how worthless you feel.
I know how you look into a mirror...
and hate what you see.
sorry, pal. It's not gonna work.
you're not real. - Sure I am.
I'm you. - I don't think so.
cause, see, this is my siesta...not yours.
all I got to do is snap my fingers, and you go bye-bye.
I'm not going anywhere. Neither are you.
like I said...
we need to talk.
Hey. Wake up.
boy, you just don't know when to leave well enough alone, do you?
you're a psycho.
you're wrong. - Yeah? Tell that to dr. Gregg.
the doc?
no, no, the doc's the one who got me hooked on this stuff, and then he took it away.
but I needed it, and he wouldn't let me have it.
so you killed him.
I can dream again.
you know what that's like - not to be able to dream?
Y- you never rest - not really. I- it's like being awake for 15 years.
and let me guess - that makes you go crazy.
I just want to be left alone.
I just want to dream.
sorry. Can't do that.
that's the wrong answer.
I'm getting better and better at this
stronger and stronger all the time.
but you and your brother...you're not waking up...
not this time. I'm not gonna let you.
I mean, you're going to hell, and you won't lift a finger to stop it.
talk about low self-esteem.
then, again, I guess it's not much of a life worth saving, now, is it?
come on, dean. Come on. Wake up.
I mean, after all, you got nothing, outside of sam.
you are nothing.
you're as mindless and obedient as an attack dog.
that's not true. - No?
what are the things that you want?
what are the things that you dream?
I mean, your car - that's dad'S.
your favorite leather jacket - dad'S.
your music - dad'S.
do you even have an original thought?
no. No, all there is is "watch out for sammy.
look after your little brother, boy.
you can still hear your dad's voice in your head, can't you?
clear as a bell. - Just shut up.
I mean, think about it.
all he ever did was train you...boss you around.
but sam...
Sam, he doted on.
Sam, he loved. - I mean it. I'm getting angry.
dad knew who you really were
a good soldier and nothing else.
D...'s blunt little instrument.
your own father didn't care whether you lived or died. Why should you?
you son of a bitch!
my father was an obsessed bastard!
all that crap he dumped on me about protecting sam - that was his crap!
he's the one who couldn't protect his family!
he's the one who let mom die!
who wasn't there for sam! I always was!
it wasn't fair! I didn't deserve what he put on me!
and I don't deserve to go to hell!
you can't escape me, dean. You're gonna die.
and this - this is what you're gonna become.
you can't stop me.
there's nothing I can't do in here.
because of the dream root.
that's right. - Yeah?
well, you're forgetting something. - What's that?
I took the dream root, too.
no. No. Dad?
you answer me when I'm talking to you, boy!
you did a little dream- weaving of your own in there, huh?
Yeah, uh, I just sort of concentrated, and it happened, you know?
didn't have anything to do with...
you know, your psychic stuff?
no.
I mean, I don't think so.
good. Good.
Hey, you guys seen bela? She's not in her room. She's not answering her phone.
she must have taken off or something.
just like that? That's a little weird.
well, if you ask me what's weird, it's why she helped us in the first place.
I thought you saved her life.
what the hell are you talking about?
the thing in flagstaff.
that thing in flagstaffwas an amulet. I gave her a good deal. That's all.
well, then, why did - - you boys better check your pockets.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
the colt.
bela stole the colt.
damn it, boys!
pack your crap. - Why? Where are we going?
we're gonna go hunt the bitch down.
Hey, sam, I was wondering
when you were in my head, what did you see?
uh, just jeremy. He kept me separated from you.
easier to beat my brains out that way, I guess.
what about you? You never said.
nothing. I was looking for you the whole time.
Sam... - yeah?
I've been doing some thinking.
and...
well, the thing is...
I don't want to die.
I don't want to go to hell.
all right, yeah.
we'll find a way to save you.
okay, good.
you can't escape me, dean. You're gonna die.
and this - this is what you're gonna become.
your brother is heading down ebrnatural.
okay, I'm in.
he's gonna find out, and if it's not from you, He's gonna be pissed.
he's gonna pissed anyway.
you satisfied?
why do you trust her so much?
I told you, Dean, she helped me go after Lilith.
well, thanks for the thumbnail -- real vid.
something major must've happened While I was downstairs, cause I come back and -- and you're bff with a demon?
you want to fill in a little detail?
sure, dean. Let's trade stories.
you first. How was hell?
don't spare the details.
now
Hey.
what?
Ted's kind of cracking the whip, isn't he?
you think I like coming home late?
I'm working my ass off.
okay.
sorry.
no, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
long day.
Oh, hey. I ran into Jill Martin today.
Gary's turning 40 on Saturday.
yeah?
she invited us to the party.
What'd you tell her?
that we'd go.
you're kidding.
what? You like Gary.
Yeah, that doesn't mean that I want to waste my Saturday night with him.
I thought you'd want to go.
I don't believe you.
I -- it's fine. I'll
I'll call Jill and tell her we can't make it.
what's with you night?
it's like you want to have a fight or something.
sex AND VIOLENCE
Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.
no storms, No -- no bad crops, nothing.
Yeah.
Yeah, I will keep looking.
you keep looking, too, Okay?
all right, talk soon.
Hey.
up and at 'em, kiddo.
you're up early. What are you doing?
nothing. I was in the can.
yeah?
Yeah. Want me to draw you a picture?
no, I'll pass.
I found a job -- Bedford, Iowa.
guy beat his wife's brains out with a meat tenderizer.
Yikes. -- And get this
third local inside two months to gank his wife.
no priors on any of them, all happily married.
sounds like "Ozzie and Harriet."
more like "the shining."
all right, well, I guess we better have a look.
why does the P. D. keep sending you guys?
I already said I don't want a lawyer.
they're lining up the firing squad.
I'm pleading guilty.
all right, look, you don't want us to represent you -- That's fine.
in fact, it's probably not a bad idea, between you and me.
we just want to understand what happened.
that's all.
Mr. Benson...
please.
what happened was...
I killed my wife.
and you want to know why?
because she made plans without asking me.
when it happened, how did you feel?
disoriented? Out of control?
like something possessed you to do it?
I knew exactly what I was doing.
I was crystal clear.
then why did you do it?
I don't know. I loved her.
we were happy.
9 g's.
that's a hefty bill.
where did you get that? -- Doesn't matter. We have it.
see, certain charges -- Ones you don't want the missus to know.
they show up under shady names Like "M & C entertainment."
Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, you're dropping plastic at a nudie bar, for instance.
we just...
want to know the truth, Mr. Benson.
her name was...
she was a stripper?
dude, her name was jasmine.
I didn't mean for it to happen.
I don't like to go to strip bars.
my buddy was having a bachelor party, and...
there she was. -- Jasmine.
she came right up to me.
and...
I -- I don't know, s -- she was just...
perfect.
everything that I wanted.
well, you pay enough, anybody will be anything.
it wasn't about the money.
it wasn't even about the sex. It was
I don't know.
I don't know what it was.
it's hard to explain.
and your wife found out?
no, she never had a clue.
then why'd you kill her?
for jasmine.
she said we would be together forever,
if -- if only j -- Vicki was...
Muerte.
afterwards, me and Jasmine were supposed to meet, and she never showed.
I don't know where she lives. I don't know her last name.
I don't even know her real first name.
I'm an idiot.
and you didn't think to tell this to the cops?
what for?
the stripper didn't do it. I did it.
and I know what I deserve.
judge doesn't give me the death sentence, I'll just do it myself.
rough night? -- Fun night. Rough morning.
can I help you?
uh, yes.
I'm special agent Stiles -- FBI.
you're Dr. Cara Roberts? -- Far as I know.
you do some work with the sheriff's department?
Yeah, when I'm not slogging it through the E. R.
it's a small town. We multitask.
well, I have some questions about a case.
about several cases, actually. You mind if I sit?
great. Uh, Adam Benson, Jim Wylie, and Steve Snyder?
Oh, yeah. The men who killed their wives.
you handled the work-ups, right?
Mm-hmm. Autopsies for thwives and tox screens for the perps.
two-for-one special.
you find anything? -- Not really.
I mean, C. O. D. on the women was pretty clear.
there was nothing unusual in their system.
what about the husbands?
can I see your badge again?
there was one thing
um, an anomaly in the blood work.
and I remember thinking how strange it was that it showed up in all three of the men.
that what showed up? -- Oxytocin.
and their levels were crazy high.
uh, oxytocin?
Mm-hmm, It's a hormone that's produced during childbirth, lactati, and sex.
ay.
people call it the love hormone.
um, you know how it feels when you first fall in love,
the whole weak-in-the-knees, tattoo-you-on-my-chest thing?
that's oxytocin.
of course, it eventually fades,
and then you're stuck with every relationship ever,
that and the painful regimen of tattoo removal.
What'd I miss?
this is my partner -- Agent Murdock.
please, "agent" sounds so formal.
you can call me Dean. -- I'm Dr. Roberts.
so, um...
can I help you with anything else?
Uh...Sure. Just one more thing.
this chemical, this... -- Oxytocin...
oxytocin
what would cause those high levels that you found?
nothing that I've ever seen.
okay. That's it. Thanks, doc.
by the way, uh, try a greasy breakfast.
best thing for a hangover.
watch it, buddy. I'm the only M. D. here.
dude, You totally c-blocked me.
so, Wylie and Snyder fessed up, huh?
one emptied his I. R. A. The other, his kid's college fund
all on the same thing.
live nude girls?
club called The honey wagon.
these guys have affairs, too, with a stripper also known as Jasmine?
yes and no. This is where it gets interesting.
each guy hooked up with a different chick.
so, what, these girls all connected somehow?
well, they all described their stripper in the same way, the exact same way.
perfect and everything that they wanted.
Yeah, at least they'll dream Barbie convinced them to murder their wives.
there's that.
you know, it's almost like they were under some kind of love spell.
sure seems that way.
which caused them to become totally psychotic.
Absolutely.
you seem pretty cheery.
strippers, Sammy. Strippers.
we are on an actual case involving strippers.
finally.
I'm looking for three girls -- Jasmine, Aurora, and Ariel.
you seriously think those names mean anything to me?
one's a red head about 5'9." The other one's Asian about
do you have any idea how many girls I deal with?
fake names, fake hair, fake...
you got to have some sort of paperwork, check stubs,
some way to keep track of the strippers.
please. Exotic dancers
independent contractors working for cash.
I stay out of their hair.
they stay out of what little I have left.
three of your customers murdered their wives.
you don't think that that's weird?
Yeah, I think that's super-freakin' weird.
but you know what it ain't?
my problem.
any luck?
no. You?
a little. I just talked to bobby.
we officially have a theory.
what's that? -- Siren.
like greek - myth siren? Like "the odyssey"?
Hey, I read.
Yeah, actually, but the siren's not actually a myth.
it's more of a beautiful creature that prey on men,
entice them with their siren song.
let me guess -- "Welcome to the jungle"? No, no.
warrant's "cherry pie"?
their song is more of a metaphor.
like their call, their allure, you know?
so they shake their thing and the guys zombie out?
basically, yeah.
sirens live on islands. Sailors would chase them,
completely ignoring the rocky shores, and dash themselves to pieces.
sounds like Adam and his buddies. -- Yeah.
if you were a siren in '09 and looking to ruin a bunch of morons,
where would you set up shop?
so, whatever floats the guy's boat, that's what they look like?
Yeah. You see, sirens can read minds.
they see what you want most, and then they can kind of,
like, cloak themselves -- You know, like an illusion.
so it could all be the same chick,
morphing into different dream girls?
Yeah, actually. Probably.
sirens are usually pretty solitary.
how do we kill it? -- Bobby's working on it.
but even if we figure that out...
how the hell are we gonna find It? It could be anybody.
Hi, belle.
thought you'd never come.
it's okay. She's asleep.
Lenny, you're amazing...
taking care of her Like this.
most guys would have put her in a nursing home.
it's no big deal.
she's my mom. -- Like I said
amazing.
baby...
I love you so much.
the way you take care of me and your mom
you're so sweet...
and strong.
I just wish you didn't have to carry it all.
I mean, your mom takes up all your time.
as long as she's around,
we can't really be happy.
she's not so bad.
I could be with you...
forever...
if only your mom wasn't here.
don't you want to be with me forever?
Yeah.
Yeah, you know I do.
then bash your mother's brains in.
baby, do it for me.
do it, baby. -- Yeah, okay.
if you say so.
I love you.
calling 219-555-0124
Hey, Sam.
Sam? You there?
Lenny Bristol was definitely another siren vic.
you got in to see him? -- Yep.
said he brought a stripper home named Belle.
couple hours later, he offed his mother.
belle, of course, went m. i. a.
wait. He killed his mom?
woman he was closest to.
Yeah, you, uh...
forgot your cellphone.
Hey, Bobby. Sam, did you find her yet?
uh, no, And doesn't seem like she's slowing down any. What about you?
got anything?
well, some lore from a dusty greek poem.
shockingly, it's a little vague.
Oh, hold on a sec. I'm gonna put you on speaker.
it says you need "a bronze dagger"
covered in the blood of a sailor under the spell of the song.
what the hell does that mean? -- You got me.
we're dealing with 3, 000 years of the telephone game here.
best guess? -- well, the siren's spell ain't got nothing to do with any song.
it's most likely some kind of toxin or venom. Something she gets in the vics' blood.
that makes them go all manchurian candidate.
uh, what do you think? She infects the men during sex?
maybe.
supernatural std.
well, however it happens,
once it's done, the siren's got to watch her back.
if she gets a dose of her own medicine...
it kills her.
like a snake getting iced by its own venom.
so we just got to find a way to juice one of the O. J. S in jail?
it's not that easy.
none of those guys are under the spell anymore.
haven't got a clue where you're gonna get the blood you need.
I think I might have an idea. -- Be careful.
these things are tricky bastards.
wrap you up in knots before you know what hit you.
Dr. Roberts. -- Agent Stiles.
can't stay away, huh?
actually, We're here on business about the blood samples,
the ones with the high...
you know, oxytocin.
do you still have them?
good. We need them.
what for?
excuse me, Dr. Roberts? -- Yeah?
excuse me.
uh, we're a little busy here, buddy.
Yeah, so am I, pal.
doc, could you give us a sec, please?
sure.
what's your name?
Nick Monroe. What's yours?
I'm special agent Sam Stiles. This is my partner -- Dean Murdock.
what office you from?
Omaha -- Violent-crimes unit.
my S. A. C. sent me down here to see about the murders.
you? -- D. C.
our assistant director assigned us.
which A. D?
what are your badge numbers? -- You're kidding, right?
I'm just following protocol.
look, man, whatever. Just...
call our A. D. He'll sort things out, huh?
uh, yeah, assistant director Kaiser, please.
hold on a second.
Yeah, sir, hello. It's agent Nick Monroe.
I'm calling about...
two of your men -- Stiles and Murdock?
uh, it seems that they've been put on my case by mistake.
are you questioning my authority?
no, no, no, sir. I'm not questioning.
you could have fooled me.
last time I checked, son, D. C. has jurisdiction.
or am I wrong?
uh, no, sir. -- Well, good.
well, the next time you want to waste my time with stupid questions, don't.
left to right: FED Marshall, FBI, CDC, Police, Health Dept.
those idjits.
well, I'm sorry, guys.
just don't let it happen again.
so, where are you at with this?
where are you at with this?
well, I was about to run the perps' blood work.
I already checked. It's a dead end.
Oh, yeah? -- Yeah.
well, get this
I feel like I found something that connects all the murders.
Really?
they were all banging strippers
from the same club.
you don't say.
what do you say we go down there and check it out?
well, here's the thing, Nick.
see, we're kind of lone wolves
you know what? That sounds like an excellent idea.
just give me a second with my partner.
and we'll, uh -- One second. Come here.
dude, you got to stay with him.
what?
keep him out of the way.
why me?
cause I got to get the blood samples.
what the hell am I supposed to do with him?
just take him to the strip club, keep an eye out for the siren.
come on, dean, just
just focus on the naked girls. You'll forget he's even there.
I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it for the girls.
we're taking my ride. No complaining about the tunes.
no way.
you drive an Impala? -- Yeah.
it's a '67, right?
it's a 3274-barrel. -- Yeah, actually.
it's a thing of beauty.
Thanks.
how the hell did you talk the bureau into letting you drive your own wheels?
and you want this blood because...
we'd like to run some tests.
you know, I've run every test there is. It's, um...
my job.
notice the lab coat.
we know a specialist who would like to try out a theory.
if you say so.
what the hell?
what?
the blood's gone.
nobody's fault but mine.
Oh, oh, oh, Zeppelin recorded it,'75.
it was a cover of a blind Willie Johnson tune.
nice.
you shook me.
69, debut album, Written by Willie Dixon.
And? -- And what?
written by Willie Dixon And J. B. Lenoir.
dude. Dude!
you know, for a fed, you're not a total dick.
aren't we both feds?
Yeah. No, I just, you know
not a lot of feds as cool as us, huh?
so, what the hell with this case, man?
how does a girl talk four different johns into murder?
crazy world. -- I guess.
Hey, Can I level with you?
I found something kind of weird.
Oh?
you brought your weird to the right spot.
lay it on me.
I went to the crime scene this morning.
saw them bagging this up.
so I went back through all the files.
it turns out a flower just like that was found at every crime scene.
like it was left on purpose?
I mean, you know, sometimes a serial killer will leave an object behind, like a calling card. But with this case?
to tell you the truth...
I got no idea what's going on.
I think I might.
I've seen a flower like this before.
we've watched them twice. Whoever took the blood...
must have tampered with the tapes.
who has access to your office? -- Everyone. I don't lock it.
you what?
I've never had this problem before.
what is so important about the blood, anyway?
I think someone drugged the men, made them commit murder.
what?
what kind of drug?
uh, I'm not sure yet.
I don't know.
I mean, I interviewed those guys, and they had their reasons.
Yeah, but they all loved their victims.
I'm sure they did.
come on.
haven't you ever been in a relationship where you really loved somebody and still kind of wanted to bash their head in?
sounds like you're speaking from experience.
Yeah.
look, I'm sorry. I-i n't mean to pry.
it's okay.
I was the one who brought it up.
Really?
it's medicine.
I'm a doctor.
his name was Carl.
and we were married.
so what happened? -- Life happened.
I don't know. I mean, I loved him.
I still do, I guess. But, um, I don't know. It's just like one day I looked up, and I was living with a stranger. And...
you know what I mean, right?
I guess. Or...
I don't know. Maybe.
people change.
God, I know I did.
but it's nothing to feel guilty about. It happens.
so you two split up?
Yeah, I suppose that's a word for it.
you need to get that?
no. Not right now.
whatever.
we've all got our own sad stories, so...
screw it.
have fun, no regrets,
and live life like there's no tomorrow.
for instance, I have been thinking about you all night.
well...
parts of you. -- Just parts?
like your lips.
they're very distracting.
it's a problem.
and I can't stop thinking about kissing them.
that so?
so...
what the hell, huh?
Sam, where the hell have you been?
with Cara. -- Oh, it's "Cara" now.
and you're not picking up your phone.
we were trying to find the blood samples. Someone stole them.
Yeah, I'll bet. -- What's that supposed to mean?
Nick found flower petals at the crime scenes.
hyacinths.
so? -- Hyacinths?
Mediterranean, from the
from the island where the whole freakin' siren myth started in the first place?
okay. -- Sam, Cara had hyacinth flowers.
you think Cara's the siren?
well, I did a little checking up on her.
she's only been in town for two months.
Yeah, and? -- And she has an ex-husband.
a dead ex-husband -- Carl Roberts.
dropped like a stone,
no warning, supposedly a heart attack.
well, maybe it was a heart attack.
you're kidding me. -- Look, I just don't think it's her.
and what makes you so sure?
I don't know. A hunch. -- A hunch?
I'm giving you cold, hard facts here, and you're giving me a hunch?
did you sleep with her?
no.
holy crap. You did.
middle of "basic instinct" and you bang Sharon Stone?
Sam, you could be under her spell right now.
dude, I'm not under her spell.
unbelievable, man. I just don't get it.
what?
nothing. -- No. Say it.
no, it's just
first it's Madison, and then Ruby, and now Cara.
it's like what is with you and banging monsters?
look, dean, I'm telling you. It's not Cara.
I feel fine. -- I'll bet you do.
you don't trust me.
no because this could be the siren talking.
look, Just tell me where you are.
I'll come meet you, And we'll figure things out.
no.
are you serious? -- I wish I weren't.
got to handle this, Sam, by myself.
Sam's in trouble, Bobby.
I think the siren's worked her mojo on him.
give me a call as soon as you get this.
Hey, man. What's up?
I need your help.
uh, sure. With what?
canvassing. We got to find somebody.
she went in Just a second ago. -- Nice work.
should we follow her in?
no, no, no. I don't want to tip her off.
I'm just waiting to see who she comes out with.
so you think, what...
she's drugging these guys?
pretty much.
I know how it sounds.
are you sure about that? 'Cause it sounds like crazy on toast.
all these different strippers,
they're magically the same girl.
but then they're not strippers at all -- It's Dr. Quinn?
it's kind of hard to explain,
but I have my reasons, and they're good ones.
so you're just gonna have to trust me on it.
Yeah. Okay.
I guess.
thank you.
that's actually nice to hear.
so, let's say she is drugging her vics.
how's she pulling that off?
she could be injecting them,
you know, or passing the toxin through physical contact.
or it could be her saliva.
you really should have wiped the lip of that thing before you drank from it, Dean.
I should be your little brother.
you can't trust him.
not like you can trust me.
in fact, I really feel like you should get him out of the way
so that we can be brothers...
forever.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
Nick, what are you doing here?
I got to tell you,
you're one butt-ugly stripper.
well, maybe.
but I got exactly what I wanted. I got dean.
Dean, come on, man. This isn't you.
you can fight this. Let me go.
why don't you cut him just a little on his neck right there?
Dean's all mine. -- You poisoned him.
no, I gave him what he needed.
and it wasn't some bch in a g-string.
it was you.
a little brother that looked up to him
that he could trust.
and now he loves me.
he'd do anything for me.
and I got to tell you, Sam,
that kind of devotion
watching someone kill for you...
is the best feeling in the world.
is that why you're slutting all over town?
I get bored.
like we all do.
and I want to fall in love again
and again and again.
tell you what, I have fought some nasty sons of bitches,
but you are one needy, pathetic loser.
you won't feel that way in a minute.
no, no.
so, I know you two have a lot you want to get off your chests.
so why don't you discuss it...
and whoever survives can be with me forever?
well, I don't know when it happened.
maybe when I was in hell.
maybe when I was staring right at you.
but the Sam I knew, he's gone.
that so?
and it's not the demon blood or the psychic crap.
it's the little stuff
the lies, the secrets. -- Oh, yeah?
what secrets? -- Phone calls to Ruby, for one.
so I need your say -- so to make a phone call?
that's the point.
you're hiding things from me.
what else aren't you telling me?
none of your business.
see what mean?
we used to be in this together.
we used to have each other's backs!
okay, fine.
you want to know why I didn't tell you about Ruby?
and how we're hunting down Lith?
because you're too weak to go after her, dean.
you're holding me back.
I'm a better hunter than you are
stronger, smarter.
I can take out demons you're too scared to go near.
that's crap.
you're too busy sitting around feeling sorry for yourself,
whing about all the souls you tortured in hell.
boo-hoo.
you're not standing in my way anymore.
do it.
do it for me, Dean.
tell me again how weak I am, Sam, huh?
how I hold you back.
no. No!
Thanks.
soda?
you boys are driving, ain't ya?
Thanks, Bobby. You know, you
you hadn't shown up when you did
done the same for me, more than once.
of course, you could have picked up a phone.
only took one call to figure out that agent Nick Monroe wasn't real.
you boys gonna be okay?
Yeah, fine. -- Yeah, good.
you know, those sirens are nasty things.
that it got to you
that's no reason to feel bad.
you gonna say goodbye to Cara?
Nah. Not interested.
Really? Why not?
what's the point?
Dean, look, you know I didn't mean the things I said back there, right?
that it was just the siren's spell talking?
of course. Me too.
okay.
so -- So we're good?
Yeah, we're good.
your brother is heading down a dangerous road, Dean.
okay. I'm in.
you gonna tell Dean about what we're doing?
I just got to figure out the right way to say it.
he's gonna find out,
and if it's not from you, he's gonna be pissed.
he's gonna pissed anyway.
you satisfied?
why do you trust her so much?
I told you, Dean, she helped me go after Lilith.
well, thanks for the thumbnail -- Real vivid.
something major must've happened while I was downstairs, 'Cause I come back and -- And you're bff with a demon?
you want to fill in a little detail?
sure, Dean. Let's trade stories.
you first. How was hell? Don't spare the details.
Hey.
what?
Ted's kind of cracking the whip, isn't he?
you think I like coming home late?
I'm working my ass off.
okay.
sorry.
no, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
long day.
Oh, hey. I ran into Jill Martin today.
Gary's turning 40 on saturday.
yeah? - She invited us to the party.
What'd you tell her? - That we'd go.
you're kidding.
what? You like gary.
Yeah, that doesn't mean That I want to waste my saturday night with him.
I thought you'd want to go.
I don't believe you.
I-it's fine.
I'll -- I'll call Jill and tell her we can't make it.
what's with you tonight?
it's like you want to have a fight or something.
Yeah, that's what I'm telling you. No storms, no
no bad crops, nothing.
Yeah. Yeah.
OK，I will keep looking. You keep looking, too, okay?
all right, talk soon.
Hey.
up and at 'em, kiddo.
you're up early. What are you doing?
nothing. I was in the can.
yeah?
Yeah. Want me to draw you a picture?
no, I'll pass.
I found a job -- Bedford, iowa.
guy beat his wife's brains out with a meat tenderizer. - Yikes.
and get this -- Third local inside two months To gank his wife.
no priors on any of them, all happily married.
sounds like "ozzie and harriet.
more like "the shining.
all right, well, I guess we better have a look.
why does the P. D. Keep sending you guys?
I already said I don't want a lawyer.
they're lining up the firing squad.
I'm pleading guilty.
all right, look, you don't want us to represent you
that's fine.
in fact, it's probably not a bad idea, between you and me.
we just want to understand what happened.
that's all.
Mr. Benson...
...please.
what happened was...
I killed my wife.
and you want to know why?
because she made plans without asking me.
when it happened, how did you feel?
disoriented? Out of control?
like something possessed you to do it?
I knew exactly what I was doing.
I was crystal clear.
then why did you do it? - I don't know.
I loved her. We were happy.
9 g's.
that's a hefty bill.
where did you get that? - Doesn't matter. We have it.
see, certain charges
ones you don't want the missus to know
they show up under shady names like "m & c entertainment.
Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, you're dropping plastic at a nudie bar, for instance.
we just... want to know the truth, Mr. Benson.
her name was...
she was a stripper?
dude, her name was jasmine.
I didn't mean for it to happen.
I don't like to go to strip bars.
my buddy was having a bachelor party,
and... there she was.
jasmine. - She came right up to me. And...
I-I don't know, S-She was just...
perfect.
everything that I wanted.
well, you pay enough, anybody will be anything.
it wasn't about the money.
it wasn't even about the sex. It was
I don't know.
I don't know what it was. It's hard to explain.
and your wife found out?
no, she never had a clue.
then why'd you kill her?
for Jasmine.
she said we would be together forever,
if -- If only j--Vicki was...
Muerte.
afterwards, me and Jasmine were supposed to meet, And she never showed.
I don't know where she lives. I don't know her last name.
I don't even know her real first name.
I'm an idiot.
and you didn't think to tell this to the cops?
what for?
the stripper didn't do it. I did it.
and I know what I deserve.
judge doesn't give me the death sentence, I'll just do it myself.
rough night? - Fun night.
rough morning.
can I help you?
uh, yes.
I'm special agent stiles -- FBI.
you're Dr. Cara Roberts? - Far as I know.
you do some work with the sheriff's department?
Yeah, when I'm not slogging it through the e. R.
it's a small town. We multitask.
well, I have some questions about a case -- About several cases, actually.
you mind if I sit? Great.
uh, adam benson, jim wylie, and steve snyder?
Oh, yeah. The men who killed their wives.
you handled the work-Ups, right?
autopsies for the wives and tox screens for the perps.
two-for-one special.
you find anything? - Not really.
I mean, C. O.D. On the women was pretty clear
there was nothing unusual in their system.
what about the husbands?
can I see your badge again?
there was one thing
um, an anomaly in the blood work.
and I remember thinking how strange it was
that it showed up in all three of the men.
that what showed up? - Oxytocin.
and their levels were crazy high.
uh, oxytocin? - Mm-Hmm, it's a hormone That's produced during childbirth, lactation, And sex.
okay.
people call it the love hormone.
um, you know how it feels when you first fall in love
the whole weak-In-The-Knees, tattoo-You-On-My-Chest thing?
that's oxytocin.
of course, it eventually fades, And then you're stuck with every relationship ever,
that and the painful regimen of tattoo removal.
What'd I miss?
this is my partner -- Agent murdock.
please, "agent" sounds so formal.
you can call me Dean. - I'm dr. Roberts.
so, um...
can I help you with anything else?
Uh...sure. Just one more thing.
this chemical, this... - Oxytocin...
oxytocin
what would cause those high levels that you found?
nothing that I've ever seen.
okay. That's it. Thanks, doc.
by the way, uh, try a greasy breakfast.
best thing for a hangover.
watch it, buddy. I'm the only m. D. Here.
dude, you totally c-Blocked me.
so, Wylie and Snyder fessed up, huh?
one emptied his I. R.A. The other, his kid's college fund
all on the same thing.
live nude girls?
club called c dhoney wagon.
these guys have affairs, too, With a stripper also known as Jasmine?
yes and no. This is where it gets interesting.
each guy hooked up with a different chick.
so, what, these girls all connected somehow?
well, they all described their stripper in the same way, The exact same way
perfect and everything that they wanted.
Yeah, at least they'll dream Barbie convinced them to murder their wives.
there's that.
you know, it's almost like they were under some kind of love spell.
sure seems that way.
which caused them to become totally psychotic.
Absolutely.
you seem pretty cheery.
strippers, sammy. Strippers.
we are on an actual case involving strippers.
I'm looking for three girls
jasmine, Aurora, and Ariel.
you seriously think those names mean anything to me?
one's a redhead about 5'9." The other one's asian about
do you have any idea how many girls I deal with?
fake names, fake hair, fake...
you got to have some sort of paperwork, check stubs,
some way to keep track of the strippers.
please. Exotic dancers
independent contractors working for cash.
I stay out of their hair.
they stay out of what little I have left.
three of your customers murdered their wives.
you don't think that that's weird?
Yeah, I think that's super-Freakin' weird.
but you know what it ain't? My problem.
any luck?
no. You?
a little. I just talked to Bobby.
we officially have a theory.
what's that? - Siren.
like greek-Myth siren? Like "the odyssey"?
Hey, I read.
Yeah, actually, but the siren's not actually a myth.
it's more of a beautiful creature that prey on men,
entice them with their siren song.
let me guess -- "Welcome to the jungle"?
no, no. Warrant's "cherry pie"?
their song is more of a metaphor
like their call, their al, you know?
so they shake their thing and the guys zombie out?
basically, yeah.
sirens live on islands. Sailors would chase them,
completely ignoring the rocky shores, And dash themselves to pieces.
sounds like adam and his buddies. - Ah.
if you were a siren in '09 And looking to ruin a bunch of morons,
where would you set up shop?
so, whatever floats the guy's boat, That's what they look like?
Yeah. You see, sirens can read minds.
they see what you want most,
and then they can kind of, like, cloak themselves
you know, like an illusion.
so it could all be the same chick,
morphing into different dream girls?
Yeah, actually. Probably.
sirens are usually pretty solitary.
how do we kill it? - Bobby's working on it.
but even if we figure that out...
how the hell are we gonna find it? It could be anybody.
Hi, Belle.
thought you'd never come.
it's okay. She's asleep.
Lenny, you're amazing...
taking care of her like this.
most guys would have put her in a nursing home.
it's no big deal.
she's my mom.
like I said
amazing.
baby...
...I love you so much.
the way you take care of me and your mom
you're so sweet......
and strong.
I just wish you didn't have to carry it all.
I mean, your mom takes up all your time.
as long as she's around, we can't really be happy.
she's not so bad.
I could be with you...
forever...
if only your mom wasn't here.
don't you want to be with me forever?
Yeah.
Yeah, you know I do.
then bash your mother's brains in.
baby, do it for me.
do it, baby.
Yeah, okay.
if you say so.
I love you.
Hey, Sam.
you there?
Lenny bristol was definitely another siren vic.
you got in to see him? - Yep.
said he brought a stripper home named belle. Couple hours later, he offed his mother.
belle, of course, went m. I.A.
wait. He killed his mom?
woman he was closest to.
Yeah, you, uh...
forgot your cellphone.
Hey, Bobby.
Sam, did you find her yet?
uh, no,
and doesn't seem like she's slowing down any. What about you? Got anything?
well, some lore from a dusty greek poem.
shockingly, it's a little vague.
Oh, hold on a sec. I'm gonna put you on speaker.
it says you need "a bronze dagger
covered in the blood of a sailor under the spell of the song.
what the hell does that mean?
you got me.
we're dealing with 3, 000 years of the telephone game here.
best guess?
well, the siren's spell ain't got nothing to do with any song.
it's most likely some kind of toxin or venom.
something she gets in the vics' blood.
that makes them go all manchurian candidate.
uh, what do you think? She infects the men during sex?
maybe.
supernatural std.
well, however it happens,
once it's done, the siren's got to watch her back.
if she gets a dose of her own medicine...
it kills her.
like a snake getting iced by its own venom.
so we just got to find a way to juice one of the o. J.S in jail?
it's not that easy.
none of those guys are under the spell anymore.
haven't got a clue where you're gonna get the blood you need.
I think I might have an idea.
be careful.
these things are tricky bastards.
wrap you up in knots before you know what hit you.
Dr. Roberts.
agent stiles.
can't stay away, huh?
actually, we're here on business About the blood samples, the ones with the high...
...you know, oxytocin.
do you still have them?
good. We need them.
what for?
excuse me, Dr. Roberts?
yeah? - Excuse me.
we're a little busy here, buddy.
Yeah, so am I, pal.
doc, could you give us a sec, please?
sure. - Thanks.
what's your name?
Nick Monroe. What's yours?
I'm special agent Sam stiles. This is my partner -- Dean murdock.
what office you from?
Omaha -- Violent-Crimes unit. My s. A.C. Sent me down here to see about the murders.
you? - D. C.
our assistant director assigned us.
which a. D?
what are your badge numbers?
you're kidding, right?
I'm just following protocol.
look, man, whatever. Just call our a. D. He'll sort things out, huh?
uh, yeah, assistant director kaiser, please.
Yeah, sir, hello. It's agent nick monroe.
I'm calling about...
two of your men -- Stiles and murdock?
uh, it seems that they've been put on my case by mistake.
are you questioning my authority?
no, no, no, sir. I'm not questioning.
you could have fooled me.
last time I checked, son, d. C. Has jurisdiction.
or am I wrong?
well, good.
well, the next time you want to waste my time with stupid questions, don't.
those idiots.
well, I'm sorry, guys.
just don't let it happen again.
so, where are you at with this?
where are you at with this?
well, I was about to run the perps' blood work.
I already checked. It's a dead end.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
well, get this -- I feel like I found something that connects all the murderers.
Really?
they were all banging strippers
from the same club.
you don't say.
what do you say we go down there and check it out?
well, here's the thing, nick.
see, we're kind of lone wolves
you know what? That sounds like an excellent idea.
just give me a second with my partner. And we'll, uh
one second. Come here.
dude, you got to stay with him.
what?
keep him out of the way.
why me?
cause I got to get the blood samples.
what the hell am I supposed to do with him?
just take him to the strip club, Keep an eye out for the siren.
come on, Dean, just
just focus on the naked girls. You'll forget he's even there.
I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it for the girls.
we're taking my ride. No complaining about the tunes.
no way.
you drive an impala? - Yeah.
it's a '67, right?
it's a 3274-Barrel.
Yeah, actually.
it's a thing of beauty.
Thanks.
how the hell did you talk the bureau into letting you drive your own wheels?
and you want this blood because...
we'd like to run some tests.
you know, I've run every test there is. It's, um...
my job.
notice the lab coat.
we know a specialist who would like to try out a theory.
if you say so.
what the hell?
what?
the blood's gone.
nobody's fault but mine.
Oh, oh, oh, zeppelin recorded it, '75.
it was a cover of a blind willie johnson tune.
nice.
you shook me.
Oh, '69, debut album, written by willie dixon.
And?
and what?
written by willie dixon and j. B. Lenoir.
dude. Dude!
you know, for a fed, you're not a total dick.
aren't we both feds?
Yeah. No, I just, you know
not a lot of feds as cool as us, huh?
so, what the hell with this case, man?
how does a girl talk four different johns into murder?
crazy world.
I guess.
Hey, can I level with you?
I found something kind of weird.
Oh?
you brought your weird to the right spot.
lay it on me.
I went to the crime scene this morning.
saw them bagging this up.
so I went back through all the files.
it turns out a flower just like that was found at every crime scene.
like it was left on purpose?
I mean, you know, sometimes a serial killer will leave an object behind, like a calling card.
but with this case?
to tell you the truth...
I got no idea what's going on.
I think I might.
I've seen a flower like this before.
we've watched them twice. Whoever took the blood...
must have tampered with the tapes.
who has access to your office?
everyone. I don't lock it.
you what?
I've never had this problem before.
what is so important about the blood, anyway?
I think someone drugged the men, made them commit murder.
what?
what kind of drug?
uh, I'm not sure yet.
I don't know.
I mean, I interviewed those guys, and they had their reasons.
Yeah, but they all loved their victims.
I'm sure they did.
come on.
haven't you ever been in a relationship where you really loved somebody
and still kind of wanted to bash their head in?
sounds like you're speaking from experience.
Yeah.
look, I'm sorry. I-I don't mean to pry.
it's okay.
I was the one who brought it up.
Really?
it's medicine.
I'm a doctor.
his name was Carl.
and we were married.
so what happened?
life happened.
I don't know. I mean, I loved him.
I still do, I guess. But, um,
I don't know. It's just like one day I looked up, And I was living with a stranger. And...
you know what I mean, right?
I guess Or...
I don't know. Maybe.
people change.
God, I know I did.
but it's nothing to feel guilty about. It happens.
so you two split up?
Yeah, I suppose that's a word for it.
you need to get that?
no.
not right now.
whatever.
we've all got our own sad stories, so...
...screw it.
have fun, no regrets, and live life like there's no tomorrow.
for instance, I have been thinking about you all night.
well...
parts of you.
just parts?
like your lips.
they're very distracting.
it's a problem.
and I can't stop thinking about kissing them.
that so?
so...
...what the hell, huh?
Sam, where the hell have you been?
with Cara.
Oh, it's "Cara" now.
and you're not picking up your phone.
we were trying to find the blood samples. Someone stole them.
Yeah, I'll bet.
what's that supposed to mean?
Nick found flower petals at the crime scenes.
hyacinths.
so? - Hyacinths?
Mediterranean, from the
from the island Where the whole freakin' siren myth started in the first place?
okay. - Sam, Cara had hyacinth flowers.
you think Cara's the siren?
well, I did a little checking up on her.
she's only been in town for two months.
Yeah, and? - And she has an ex-Husband.
a dead ex-Husband -- Carl Roberts.
dropped like a stone, no warning, supposedly a heart attack.
well, maybe it was a heart attack.
you're kidding me.
look, I just don't think it's her.
and what makes you so sure?
I don't know. A hunch.
a hunch?
I'm giving you cold, hard facts here, and you're giving me a hunch?
did you sleep with her?
no.
holy crap. You did.
middle of "basic instinct" and you bang sharon stone?
Sam, you could be under her spell right now.
dude, I'm not under her spell.
unbelievable, man. I just don't get it.
what?
nothing.
no. Say it.
no, it's just
first it's Madison, and then Ruby, and now Cara.
it's like what is with you and banging monsters?
look, Dean, I'm telling you. It's not Cara. I feel fine.
I'll bet you do.
you don't trust me.
no because this could be the siren talking.
look, just tell me where you are. I'll come meet you, and we'll figure things out.
no.
are you serious?
I wish I weren't.
I got to handle this, Sam, by myself.
Sam's in trouble, Bobby.
I think the siren's worked her mojo on him.
give me a call as soon as you get this.
Hey, man. What's up?
I need your help.
uh, sure. With what?
canvassing. We got to find somebody.
she went in just a second ago.
nice work.
should we follow her in?
I'm just waiting to see who she comes out with.
so you think, what...
she's drugging these guys?
pretty much.
I know how it sounds.
are you sure about that? 'Cause it sounds like crazy on toast.
all these different strippers -- They're magically the same girl.
but then they're not strippers at all
it's Dr. Quinn?
it's kind of hard to explain,
but I have my reasons, and they're good ones.
so you're just gonna have to trust me on it.
Yeah. Okay.
I guess.
thank you.
that's actually nice to hear.
so, let's say she is drugging her vics.
how's she pulling that off?
she could be injecting them,
you know, or passing the toxin through physical contact.
or it could be her saliva.
you really should have wiped the lip of that thing before you drank from it, Dean.
I should be your little brother.
...you can't trust him.
not like you can trust me.
in fact, I really feel like you should get him out of the way
so that we can be brothers...
forever.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
what are you doing here?
I got to tell you, you're one butt-Ugly stripper.
well, maybe.
but I got exactly what I wanted. I got Dean.
Dean, come on, man. This isn't you. You can fight this.
let me go.
why don't you cut him just a little on his neck right there?
Aah!
Dean's all mine.
you poisoned him.
no, I gave him what he needed.
and it wasn't some bitch in a g-String.
it was you.
a little brother that looked up to him
that he could trust.
and now he loves me.
he'd do anything for me.
and I got to tell you, Sam,
that kind of devotion
watching someone kill for you...
...is the best feeling in the world.
is that why you're slutting all over town?
Oh.
I get bored.
like we all do.
and I want to fall in love again
and again and again.
tell you what, I have fought some nasty sons of bitches,
but you are one needy, pathetic loser.
you won't feel that way in a minute.
no, no.
so, I know you two
have a lot you want to get off your chests.
so why don't you discuss it...
and whoever survives can be with me forever?
well, I don't know when it happened.
maybe when I was in hell.
maybe when I was staring right at you.
but the Sam I knew, he's gone.
that so?
and it's not the demon blood or the psychic crap.
it's the little stuff
the lies, the secrets.
Oh, yeah?
what secrets?
phone calls to Ruby, for one.
so I need your say-So to make a phone call?
that's the point.
you're hiding things from me.
what else aren't you telling me?
none of your business.
see what I mean?
we used to be in this together.
we used to have each other's backs!
okay, fine.
you want to know why I didn't tell you about Ruby?
and how we're hunting down Lilith?
because you're too weak to go after her, Dean.
you're holding me back.
I'm a better hunter than you are
stronger, smarter.
I can take out demons you're too scared to go near.
that's crap.
you're too busy sitting around
feeling sorry for yourself,
whining about all the souls you tortured in hell.
you're not standing in my way anymore.
tell me again how weak I am, Sam, huh?
how I hold you back.
no.
No!
Thanks.
soda?
you boys are driving, ain't ya?
Thanks, Bobby.
you know, you -- You hadn't shown up when you did
done the same for me, more than once.
of course, you could have picked up a phone.
only took one call to figure out
that agent nick monroe wasn't real.
you boys gonna be okay?
Yeah, fine.
Yeah, good.
see you
you know, those sirens are nasty things.
that it got to you -- That's no reason to feel bad.
you gonna say goodbye to Cara?
Nah.
not interested.
Really? Why not?
what's the point?
well, look at you. Love 'em and leave 'em.
Dean, look, you know I didn't mean
the things I said back there, right?
that it was just the siren's spell talking?
of course. Me too.
okay.
so -- So we're good?
Yeah, we're good.
Lilith is trying to break the 66 seals to free lucifer from hell.
who are you? - Castiel.
I'm an angel of the lord.
Anna, you all right?
I remember now who I am.
I'm an angel.
you can't run...Dean.
this is Uriel, a specialist.
Pamela Barnes, best damn psychic in the state.
he took me off the rack, and I tortured souls,And I liked it.
no matter how many people I save,I can't fill this hole.
it's not the psychic thing I got a problem with.
Yeah, I know what you got a problem with,but tough.
it's the only way. - no.
I know what you did to that demon, Sam.
goodbye, sister.
what the hell?
ruby will meet us outside cheyenne.
she's been tracking some leads.
look, I know she's not exactly on your christmas list,but if she can help us get to Lilith.
man, work with ruby, don't. I don't really give a Rat's ass.
what's your problem?
Pamela didn't want anything to do with this,
and we dragged her back into it, Sam.
she knew what was at stake.
Oh, yeah, saving the world.
and we're doing such a damn good job of it.
I'm tired of burying friends, Sam.
look, if we catch a fresh trail，we follow it.
I know.
like I said, I'm just -- I'm just getting tired.
well, get angry.
home, crappy home.
Winchester and Winchester.
Oh, come on!
you are needed.
needed?
we just got back from needed!
now, you mind your tone with me.
no, you mind your damn tone with us.
we just got back from Pamela's funeral.
Pamela -- you know, psychic Pamela?
you remember her.
Cass, you remember her. You burned her eyes out.
remember that? Good times!
Yeah, then she died saving one of your precious seals.
so, maybe you can stop pushing us around like chess pieces for five freakin' minutes!
we raised you out of hell for our purposes.
Yeah, and what were those again?
what exactly do you want from me?
start with gratitude.
Dean, we know this is difficult to understand.
and we...don't...care.
now, seven angels have been murdered, all of them from our garrison.
the last one was killed tonight.
demons?
how they doing it?
we don't know.
I'm sorry, but what do you want us to do about it?
I mean, a demon with the juice to ice angels has to be out of our league, right?
we can handle the demons, thank you very much.
once we find whoever it is.
so, you need our help...
hunting a demon?
not quite.
we have Alastair. - great.
he should be able to name your triggern.
but he won't talk.
alastair's will is very strong.
we've arrived at an impasse.
Yeah, well, he's like a black belt in torture.
I mean, you guys are out of your league.
that's why we've come to his student.
you happen to be the most qualified interrogator we've got.
you're our best hope.
no.
no way.
you can't ask me to do this, Cass -- not this.
who said anything...about "asking"?
damn it!
this devil's trap is old enochian.
he's bound completely.
fascinating.
Where's the door?
where are you going?
hitch back to cheyenne, thank you very much.
angels are dying, boy.
everybody's dying these days.
I get it, you're powerful, you can make me do whatever you want,but you can't make me do this.
this is too much to ask. I know.
but we have to ask it.
I want to talk to Cass alone.
I think I'll go seek...revelation.
we might have some further orders.
well, get some doughnuts while you're out.
Ah, this one just won't quit, will he?
I think I'm starting to like you, boy.
you guys don't walk enough. You're gonna get flabby.
you know, I'm starting to think junkless has a better sense of humor than you do.
Uriel's the funniest angel in the garrison.
ask anyone.
what's going on, Cass?
since when does Uriel put a leash on you?
my superiors have begun to question my sympathies.
your sympathies?
I was getting too close to the human.
you.
they feel I've begun to express emotions,the doorways to doubt.
this can impair my judgment.
well, tell Uriel or whoever...you do not want me doing this, trust me.
want it? no.
but I've been told we need it.
you ask me to open that door and walk through it...you will not like what walks back out.
for what it's worth...I would give anything not to have you do this.
heaven.
I'm in heaven.
and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
I seem to find the happiness I seek.
when we're out together dancing.
cheek to cheek.
I'm sorry.
I...
this is a very serious, very emotional situation for you.
I shouldn't laugh.
it's just that, I mean, are they serious?
they sent you to torture me?
you got one chance.
one.
tell me who is killing the angels.
I want a name.
you think I'll see all your scary toys and spill my guts?
Oh, you'll spill your guts, one way or another.
I just didn't want to ruin my shoes.
well...
now answer the question.
or what? you'll work me over?
but then, maybe...
you don't want to.
maybe...
you're a-scared to...
not entirely.
you left part of yourself back in the pit.
let's see if we can...get the two of you back together again, shall we?
you're gonna be disappointed.
you have not disappointed me so far.
come on.
you got to want a little payback for everything I did to you，for all the pokes and prods.
no?
then...
how about for all the things I did to your daddy?
I can still smell them.
seriously, Sam, I'm not exactly dying to tangle with angels again.
I need you to find out where they took Dean.
not sure I see the problem.
you know they have Alastair strung up six ways from Sunday.
Dean cuts himself a slice,Al's reduced to a quivering heap.
and the good guys get the goods.
what's wrong with that?
he can't do it.
look, I get it.
you don't want him going all torture master again.
no, I mean, he can't do it.
he can't get the job done.
something happened to him downstairs, Ruby.
he's not what he used to be. He's not strong enough.
and you are?
I will be.
had your pop on my rack for close to a century.
can't stall rever.
John Winchester -- made quite a name for himself.
a hundred years.
and after each session,I'd make him the same offer I made you.
I'd put down my blade if he picked one up.
just give me the demon's name, Alastair.
but...
he said, "nein......"each and every time.
damned if i couldn't break him.
pulled out all the stops.
but John -- he was... made of something unique.
the stuff of heroes.
and then came Dean.
Mmm, Dean Winchester.
I thought I was up against it again.
but daddy's "little girl."
he broked.
he broked in 30.
just not the man your daddy wanted you to be, huh, dean?
now...
now we're getting somewhere.
holy water?
come on!
grasshopper, you're gonna have to get creative, Alastair?
you know something, Alastair?
I could still dream, even in hell.
and over and over and over, you know what I dreamt?
I dreamt of this moment.
and believe me......I got a few ideas.
let's get started.
let me know if you want some more.
there's plenty left.
go directly to hell.
do not pass go. do not collect $200.
relax. The fire is our friend.
besides, the only part of the map we need is the "where's Dean" part.
out.
there. your brother is there.
and it's a good thing angels aren't concerned with hiding their dirty business.
not used to being spied on.
I mean, who'd be stupid enough to try?
ruby, it's been weeks.
I need it.
you don't seem too happy about it.
you think I want to do this?
this is the last thing I...
but I need to be strong enough.
it's okay.
it's okay, Sammy.
you can have it.
it's okay, Sam.
there's that little pig poker.
I wondered where it went.
do you really think this is gonna fix you?
give you closure?
Oh, that is sad.
that's really sad.
sad, sad.
I...carved you into a n-new animal, Dean.
there is no...going back.
maybe you're right.
but now it's my turn to carve.
Hello, Castiel.
your human body.
it was destroyed. I know.
but...
I guess I'm sentimental.
called in some old favors, and...
you shouldn't be here.
we still have orders to kill you.
somehow, I don't think you'll try.
Where's Uriel?
he went to receive revelation.
right.
well, it's your professionalism that I respect.
why are you letting Dean do this?
he's doing God's work.
Torturing?
that's God's work?
stop him, Cass, please.
before you ruin the one real weapon you have.
who are we to question the will of God?
unless... this isn't his will.
then where do the orders come from?
I don't know. One of our superiors maybe.
but not him.
who's murdering the angels?
the father you love...
you think he wants this?
you think he'd ask this of you?
you think this is righteous?
what you're feeling...
it's called doubt.
these orders are wrong,and you know it.
but you can do the right thing.
you're afraid, Cass.
I was, too.
but together, we can...
together?
I am nothing like you.
you fell.
go.
go.
just not getting deep enough.
well, you lack the resources.
reality is just...
I don't know.
...too concrete up here.
honestly, Dean...
you have no idea how bad it really was...
and what you really did for us.
shut up.
the whole bloody thing, Dean.
the reason Lilith wanted you there in the first place.
okay, then I'll just make you shut up.
s-sorry.
something caught in my throat.
I think it's my throat.
well, strap in.
cause I'm just starting to have fun.
you know...
it was supposed to be your father.
he was supposed to bring it on.
but in the end, it was you.
bring what on?
every night, the same offer, remember?
same as your father.
and finally you said, "sign me up."
Oh, the first time you picked up my razor,the first time，you sliced into that weeping bitch...
that was the first seal.
you're lying.
and it is written that the first seal shall be broken "when a righteous man sheds blood in hell."
as he breaks, so shall it break.
we had to break the first seal before any others.
only way to get the dominoes to fall right.
topple the one at the front of the line.
when we win...
when we bring on the apocalypse and burn this earth down...
we'll owe it all to you...
believe me, son.
I wouldn't lie about this.
it's kind of a......religious sort of thing with me.
no.
I don't think you are lying.
but even if the demons do win......you won't be there to see it.
you should talk to your plumber about the pipes.
you've got a lot to learn, boy, so I'll see you back in class,bright and early, Monday morning.
Oh, almost.
looks like god is on my side today.
you know...
like roaches, you celestials.
I really wish I knew how to kill you.
but all I can do is send you back to heaven.
stupid pet tricks.
who's murdering the angels?
how are they doing it?
you think I'm gonna tell you?
Yeah, I do.
how are the demons killing angels?!
I...
Don't...know!
right.
It's...not...us!
We're...not doing it!
I don't believe you.
Lilith... is not behind this.
she wouldn't kill seven angels.
she'd kill 100...
1000.0
Oh, go ahead.
send me back...
if you can.
I'm stronger than that now.
now I can kill.
Sam -- - get in there and heal him.
miracle -- now. - I can't.
you and Uriel put him in there! - no.
because you can't keep a simple devil's trap together.
I don't know what happened. That trap...it shouldn't have broken. I am sorry.
this whole thing was pointless.
you understand that?
the demons aren't doing the hits.
something else is killing your soldiers.
perhaps Alastair was lying.
no.
he wasn't.
I received revelation from our superiors.
our brothers and sisters are dying, and they...they want us to stop hunting the demon responsible.
something is wrong up there.
I mean, can you feel it?
the murderers -- maybe they aren't demonic.
Sam Winchester said the demons have nothing to do with it.
if not the demons, what could it be?
the will of heaven.
we are failing, Uriel.
we are losing the war.
perhaps the garrison is being punished.
you think our father would...
I think maybe our father isn't giving the orders anymore.
maybe there is something wrong.
well, I won't wait to be gutted.
Anna, please.
decided to kill me after all?
I'm alone.
what do you want from me, Castiel?
I'm considering disobedience.
good.
no. it isn't.
for the first time...
I feel.
it gets worse.
choosing your own course of action, it's confusing...
it's terrifying.
that's right.
you're too good for my help.
I'm just trash...
a walking blasphemy.
I don't know what to do.
please tell me what to do.
like the old days?
no.
I'm sorry.
it's time to think for yourself.
you called?
what do you say, Castiel?
will you join me?
will you fight with me?
it's strange...
strange how...
a leaky pipe can undo the work of angels.
when we ourselves...are supppped to be the agents of fate.
alastair was much more powerful than we had imagined.
no.
no demon can overpower that trap.
I made it myself.
we've been friends for a long time, Uriel.
fought by each others' sides,served together away from home...
...for what seems like...forever.
we're brothers, Uriel.
pay me that respect. Tell me the truth.
the truth is...the only thing that can kill an angel......is another angel.
you.
I'm afraid so.
and you broke the devil's trap,set Alastair on Dean.
alastair should never have been taken alive.
really inconvenient, Cass.
Yes, I did turn the screw a little.
for the murders of our kin?
not murders, Castiel.
no.
my work...is conversion.
how long have we waited here?
how long have we played this game by rules that make no sense?
it is our father's world, Uriel.
our father?
he stopped being that, if he ever was,the moment he created them.
humanity.
his favorites.
his whining, puki larvae.
are you trying to convert me?
I wanted you to join me, and I still do.
with you, we can be powerful enough to...
to?
to raise our brother.
Lucifer.
you do remember him.
how strong he was...
how beautiful.
and he didn't bow to humanity.
he was punished for defending us.
now, if you want to believe in something, Cass,believe in him.
Lucifer is not God.
God isn't god anymore.
he doesn't care what we do.
I am proof of that.
but this?
what were you gonna do, Uriel?
were you gonna kill the whole garrison?
I only killed the ones who said no.
others have joined me, Cass.
now, please, brother. don't fight me.
help me.
help me spread the word.
help me bring on this apocalypse.
all you have to do...
is be unafraid.
for the first time in a long time......I am.
you can't win, Uriel.
I still serve god.
you haven't even met the man!
there is no will!
no wrath!
No...god.
maybe or maybe not.
but there's still me.
are you all right?
no thanks to you.
you need to be more careful.
you need to learn how to manage a damn devil's trap.
that's not what I mean.
uriel is dead.
was it the demons?
it was disobedience.
he was working against us.
is it true?
did I break the first seal?
did I start all this?
Yes.
when we discovered Lilith's plan for you......we laid siege to hell,and we fought our way to get to you before you jump-started the apocalypse.
but we were too late.
why didn't you just leave me there, then?
it's not...
blame that falls on you, Dean.
it's fate.
and the righteous man who begins it is the only one who can nish it.
you have to stop it.
Lucifer?
the apocalypse?
what does that mean?
Hey!
don't you go disappearing on me, you son of a bitch.
what does that mean?
I don't know.
bull!
I don't.
Dean, they don't tell me much.
I know...
how our fate rests with you.
well, then, you guys are screwed.
I can't do it, Cass.
it's too big.
alastair was right.
I'm not all here.
I'm not -- I'm not strong enough.
well, I guess I'm not the man either of our dads wanted me to be.
find someone else.
it's not me.
then and why would an angel rescue me from hell?
because we have work for you.
you got a lot to learn, boy.
did I break the first seal? Did I start l this?
Yes.
why didn't you just leave me there, then?
the righteous man who begins it is the only one who can finish it.
yo have to stop it.
our fate rests with you.
find someone else.
it's not me.
now
pr morning news

cayenne and maple syrup. Are you serious?
how much did you lose?

great. Anytime.
Hey. Yo.

she's okay.
might have to hit that.
Oh, dude, that's totally age-inappropriate.
experience.
uh, trifocals. -There's a milf there, Sam. I just know it.
maybe a gmilf. Come on.
coffee break? - Yeah, for sure.
Paul, time for a refuel, buddy.
sorry. No time.
since when?
dude, we get paid by the hour. -Working!
okay. -He seems stressed.
probably just freaked 'cause he got busted surfing porn on the internet.
no, no, no. Wait. When?
he got sent up to H. R. yesterday.
guess they put the fear of god in him.
Ian! Dude! -Just doing a little shopping. Running low at home.
so, Sam...had any of those dreams lately?
what? Don't be like that.
come on. It's the highlight of my day.
I never should have told you in the first place.
they're genius! Don't hold out on me, dude.
share with the class. -You're just gonna be a dick about it.
What?! No way!
I won't say a word -- total respect.
go.
I dreamt that I saved a grim reaper named Tessa from demons.
classic!
how much d&d did you play when you were a kid?
Oh, my. Okay, so you're rescuing the grim reaper. You're a hero.
I mean, thank god, we got "harry potter" here to save us all from the apocalypse.
Dick. - Wird.
can I ask you a question?
look, man, I told you, I'm not into the --oh, dude, come on. I'm not either.
I just want to ask you one question.
sure.
what do you think about ghosts?
ghosts?
do you believe in them?
uh, tell you the truth, I've never given it much thought.
vampires? -What? Why?
cause I've been having some...weird dreams lately.
you know what I mean? -No, not really.
So...you've never had any...weird dreams?
all right, look, man, uh... I don't know you, okay?
but I'm gonna do a public service and, uh, let you know that -- that you over-share.
did you turn it off, then on?
all right, well, let's try that.
no, no, it's fine. I'll wait.
is it printing now? Oh, that's great.
anytime.
whatcha doin'?
nothing.
you get an e-mail from human resources?
no. Why?
damn it. Guess it's just me, then.
I'm supposed to, quote, "report to H. R." unquote.
well, they're probably finally busting you for snaking all those office supplies.
I hope they spank me.
no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on!
don't do this to me. Please!
Hey, man. You okay?
it froze. They're crap, Paul.
they freeze all the time. You don't understand.
when -- when I rebooted, everything was gone. A whole day's work --deleted.
well, did you back up? -No, I didn't back up.
I wish to god I backed up, but I didn't.
I'll get it back. I'll find it.
it's somewhere.
find it!
Paul, it's okay, man. These things happen.
come on! Come on!
come on!
come on!
please! Please!
all that work... gone.
failed.
something seem not right to you?
uh, yeah.
try the whole thing.
I'm telling you, man... I'll never eat popcorn again.
Yeah, right.
two weeks?
Hey, why would someone kill themselves two weeks before they were supposed to retire?
I mean, Paul was two weeks from freedom.
he should have been... happy, right?
I don't have time for this, Sam.
that's very funny.
what's with you? -I'm working.
it's important.
H. R. bust your balls or something?
you're wearing the shirt.
did you shave?
tech support. This is Ian.
be right up.
I have to go up to 22, speak to a manager.
Hi. "Ian," is it? Mm-hmm. Yeah, come on in.
yesterday, you filled out a 445-T.
and, uh, no problem -- just a -- just a few errors.
I mean, we did just switch over to vista, so I'm sure you're used to filling out the dash-r's, am I right?
Oh, no.
no, no, no. It's fine. It's fine.
I just need you to redo one today so I can get the show on the road with the invoicing.
Oh, my god. -No, it's fine. Just re-file it, and we're square.
I can't believe I did this. I can't --I can't believe it. I...can't believe I did this.
Hey, guy, come on --no, no.
it affected profits. It -- I screwed up.
I-I can't --I can't -- I am so sorry.
how could I do that?
I failed sand over.
I failed the company. -Uh, why don't you sit down, Ian?
no. -Ian. Ian! Hey!
Ian, hey.
just chill out, man. Okay?
H-hey, maybe we should get out of here, huh?
come on. Ian.
look at me.
somebody help me!
I, uh, I-I followed him into the bathroom.
he was, uh...he was standing there in front of the mirror, and then...and, uh, he stabbed himself in the neck.
I'm sorry. That's, uh...
tech support. This is Sam.
I need to see you in my office -- now.
come on in. Shut the door.
who the hell are you?
I'm not sure I know.
what the hell does that mean?
I started here three weeks ago.
all right.
you cornered me in the elevator, talking about ghosts.
and now...
now what?
now nothing. I,uh...
so, you started working here three weeks ago, huh?
me too.
it's, uh, master cleanse.
you tried it?
phenomenal. Detoxes you like nobody's business.
when you were in that bathroom with Ian...did you see something?
I don't know. I don't know what I saw.
wait. Are you saying that -- did you...see a ghost?
I was freaking out.
the guy penciled his damn neck.
you did, didn't you?
okay, listen -- what if these suicides...aren't suicides?
I mean, w-what if there's something...not natural?
so, what -- ghosts are real?
and they're responsible for all the dead bodies around here?
is that what you're telling me?
I know it sounds crazy.
but yes -- that's what I'm telling you.
based on what?
instinct?
I've got the same instinct.
Seriously?
you know those dreams I was telling you about?
I was dreaming about ghosts.
and then it turns out that there's a real ghost.
so you're telling me that your dreams are special visions and you're some kind of psychic?
no.
I mean that would be nuts.
so I've been digging around a little.
I think I found a connection between the two guys.
you broke into their e-mail accounts?
I used...some skills that I happen to have to...satisfy my curiosity.
nice.
Yeah, okay.
so, it turns out Ian and Paul both got this same e-mail telling them to report to H. R. Room 1444.
H. R.'s on 7.
exactly.
should we go check this out?
Like...right now?
no.
no, it's getting late. You're right.
I am dying to check this out right now.
right?
Hello?
Hello?
how'd you know how to do that?
I have no idea.
holy crap, dude.
Yeah.
I could use a beer.
Oh, sorry, man. I'm on the cleanse.
I got rid of all the carbs in the house.
Hey, how the hell did you know that ghosts are scared of wrenches?
crazy, right?
and nice job kicking in that door, too.
that was very jet Li.
what are you -- like, a black belt or something?
no.
I have no clue how I did that.
it's like...we've done this before.
what do you mean, "before"?
like "shirley maclaine" before?
no.
I just can't shake this feeling like I ...like I don't belong here, you know what I mean?
like I should do something more than sit in a cubicle.
I think most people who work in a cubicle feel that same way.
no.
well, look, it's more than that.
like -- like I don't like my job.
I don't like this town.
I don't like my clothes.
I don't like my own last name.
I -- I don't know how else to explain it, except that...it feels like I should be doing something else.
there's just...something in my blood.
like I was destined for something different.
what about you?
you ever feel that way?
I don't believe in destiny.
I do believe in dealing with what's rightn front of us, though.
all right.
so, what do we do now?
we do what I do best, Sammy.
research.
okay.
did you just call me "Sammy"?
did I?
I think you did.
Yeah.
don't.
sorry.
Oh, jackpot!
what you got?
I just found the best site ever.
these guys are genius.
check it out.
instructional videos?
we know why you're watching.
you've got a problem.
a ghost problem.
a ghost-related problem.
a-a ghost -- it's like a ghost-adjacent.
it's like a problem, and the ghost -- whatever.
well, you've come to the right place.
the only decent place, really, because the ghostfacers know how to solve it.
period.
watch and learn.
see, the first step in any supernatural fight...Figure out what you're up against.
that's him. That's the ghost.
P. T.Sandover -- died 1916.
devoted his life to his work.
no wife, no kids.
used to say he was the company and his very blood pumped through the building.
so, slight workaholic.
maybe he's still here, you know, watching over the company , even killing for it.
Plus, turns out this isn't the first time people started killing themselves in the building.
1929 -- the crash.
Yeah, but lots of guys jumped off of lots of high-rises that year.
how many companies had 17 suicides?
okay, so, P.T. Sandover -- protector of the company.
his ghost wakes up and becomes active during times of grave economic distress.
well, I mean, the worst time we've seen since the great depression...is now.
Yeah, now sucks.
my portfolio's in the sewer. I don't even want to talk about it.
so, Sandover's helping the bottom line...by zapping some model employees.
I mean, Ian and Paul ， it was like he turned them into different people.
perfect worker bees -- exactly.
so devoted to the company that they would commit hara-kiri if they failed it.
one more interesting fact.
the building wasn't always that high.
used to be 14 floors.
and the room where the ghost attacked, 1444，once upon a time, that was the old man's office.
once you've got that thing in your sights... you kill it!
using special ghost-hunting weapons.
first, salt.
it's like acid to ghosts.
burny acid. -Not lsd.
it's a bad trip for ghosts.
next up -- iron.
that's why the wrench worked.
pure power in your hand -- dissipates ghosts instantly.
next little trick, we learned this from those useless douche bags...that we hate...the Winchesters.
gun. -Shotgun shell.
pack it up with fresh rock salt.
very effective.
v-very effective.
Winchesters still suck ass, though.
affirmative.
suckage -- major.
where do we even get a gun?
gun store?
isn't there, like, some kind of waiting period or something?
I think so.
then how in the hell?
I don't know, man. It seems pretty impossible, honestly.
right.
the aforementioned super-annoying Winchester douche-nozzles also taught us this one other thing.
you have to burn the remains.
sometimes you might have to dig up the body.
sorry.
it's illegal in some states. -All states.
possibly all states.
Sandover was cremated.
what?
so, what do we do now?
now, if the deceased has been cremated...don't panic.
don't panic.
you just got to look for some other remains.
hair in a locket, maybe, fingernails, baby teeth，milk teeth.
genetic material.
you know what we're talking about.
go find it.
fight well, young lions.
Godspeed.
set your cellphone to walkie-talkie in case we get separated.
how the hell are we gonna find some ancient speck of DNA in a skyscraper?
well, that creepy storeroom used to be sandover's office, right?
what the hell are you doing here?
nothing.
I just --come with me.
man, l-listen -- it's okay.
I-I work here. -Whatever.
tell it to the cops.
well, come on.
what?
last time this happened, it took them two hours to get here.
let's just wait.
seriously -- I'll wait.
look, I don't have the rest of my life here.
Hey. You okay?
call you back.
Dean? You there?
Yeah. Listen, I think I got it.
meet me on 22.
just, uh...take the stairs.
that's a lot of blood.
Yeah, I know.
right.
so, uh, in there.
P. T.Sandover's gloves.
how much you want to bet there's a little smidge of DNA in there?
you know, like a fingernail clipping or a hair or two. Something.
so, you ready?
I have no idea.
me neither.
go for it.
right.
nice!
nice catch. -Right?
that was amazing!
right?
right?
man, I got to tell you, I've never had so much fun in my life.
me neither.
it was a hell of a workout, too, wasn't it?
we should keep doing this.
I know.
I mean it.
there got to be other ghosts out there.
we could help a lot of people.
Yeah, right. We'd be like the ghostfacers.
no, really.
I mean for real.
what?
quit our jobs and hit the road?
exactly.
how would we live?
come on. You got to be kidding me.
how would we get by -- with stolen credit cards?
eating diner food enched in saturated fats?
sharing a crap motel room every night?
that's all just details.
details are everything!
you don't want to go fighting ghosts without any health insurance.
all right.
confession.
what?
remember those dreams I told you about, with the ghosts?
Yeah.
I was fighting them.
with you.
we were these, like hunters.
and we were friends.
more like brothers, really.
I mean, what if that's who we really are?
I mean, you saw us back there, working together.
t-the ghost was scrambling people's brains.
what if it scrambled ours?
that's insane.
is it?
think about it for just one second.
what if we think this is our life...
but it's not?
Hey, man, the ghost is dead, and we're still standing.
I mean, I'm sorry, but --look, all I know is, this isn't who we're supposed to be.
no.
I'm Dean Smith, okay?
director of sales and marketing.
I went to Stanford. My father's name is Bob, my mother's name is Ellen, and my sister's name is Jo.
when's the last time you talked to them?
to any of them?
you're upset. You're upset, you're confused.
Yeah, "cause I only moved here."
but I called her number and I got a damn animal hospital.
okay, what are you saying?
y-you trying to say that -- that my family isn't real?
that we've been injected with fake memories? Come on!
all I know is, I got this feeling in my gut.
and I know -- I know that, deep down, you got to be feeling it, too.
we're supposed to be something else.
you're not just some corporate douche bag.
this isn't you.
I know you.
know me?
you don't know me, pal.
you should go.
got a minute?
sure.
of course.
how are you feeling, Dean?
great.
you look a little tired.
been working hard, I guess.
Ah, don't be modest. I hear everything.
and I'm pleased with what I'm hearing.
that's why it's important to me that you're happy.
how's that for a bonus?
very generous.
purely selfish. I want to make sure you're not going anywhere.
are you sure? -Positive.
you are Sandover material, son，real go-getter, carving your own way.
well, thanks. I try.
I see big things in your future.
maybe even senior V. P. Eastern great lakes division.
don't get me wrong. You'll have to work for it seven days a week, lunch at your desk, but in 8 to 10 short years, that could be you.
uh, well, thank you.
thank you, sir.
it's, um...
but...
I am giving my notice.
this is a joke.
you're kidding me, right?
no, I...I recently -- uh, very recently realized that I have some other work I have to do.
it's, uh...very important to me.
other work? Another company?
no, I -- it's hard to explain.
it's just that this...this is,it's just...it's not who I'm supposed to be.
what?
finally.
what the hell?
why am I wearing a tie?
my god, am I hungry.
welcome back.
wait.
did I -- did I just get touched by?
you're an angel, aren't you?
I'm Zachariah.
Oh, great. That's all I need, is another one of you guys.
I'm hardly "another one," Dean I'm Castiel's superior.
believe me, I had no interest in popping down here and into one of these smelly things.
but after the unfortunate situation with Uriel, I felt it necessary to pay a visit get my ducks in a row.
I am not one of your ducks.
starting with your attitude.
Oh, so, what? This -- this was all some sort of a lesson?
is that what you're telling me?
well, very creative.
you should see my decoupage.
gross.
no, thank you.
so, what, I'm -- I'm just hallucinating all this? Is that it?
not at all. Real place, real haunting.
just plunked you in the middle without the benefit of your memo.
just to shake things up?
so you guys can have fun watching us run around like ass-clowns in -in monkey suits?
to prove to you that the path you're on is truly in your blood.
you're a hunter.
not because your dad made you.
not because gocalled you back from hell.
but because it is what you are.
and you love it.
you'll find your way to it in the dark every single time, and you're miserable without it.
Dean, let's be real here -- you're good at this.
you'll be successful.
you will stop-- I stop what?
the apocalypse, huh?
Lucifer? What?
be specific, man!
you'll do everything you're destined to do.
all of it.
but I know, I know.
you're not strong enough.
you're scared.
you got daddy issues.
you can't do it, right?
angel or not, I will stab you in your face.
all I'm saying is it's how you look at it.
most folks live and die without moving anything more than the dirt it takes to bury them.
you get to change things to save people.Maybe even the world.
all the while, you drive a classic car and fornicate with women.
this isn't a curse -- it's a gift.
so, for god's sakes, Dean, quit whining about it.
look around.
there are plenty of fates worse than yours.
so, you with me?
you want to go steam yourself another latte?
or are you ready to stand up and be who you really are?
you left.
your brother and me -- We needed you.
you walked away, sam.
you walked away!
you're the one who said "don't come back," dad.
you're the one who closed that door, not me!
Sammy, i just couldn't accept the fact That you and me
we're just different.
we're not different. Not anymore.
ruby, it's been weeks. I need it.
do you even kn eff the reservation you've gone?
how far fyour ??
Brit's alreadyded down a dangone ??? too far, sam.
if i didn't know you,
I would want to hunt you.
No! Go away!
No!
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
???
Oh, god. Oh, lord.
Ah??? Oh, god.
Oh, g.
okay. God.
Hey.
how'd you sleep?
how do you think?
I'm starving. Let's get breakfast.
where? We're like two hours from anything.
but i'm hungry now.
there's probably a sandwich in the backseat still.
???
ist that dad' done?
Hello?
is this john?
he can't come to the phone. Can i help you?
no. I really need to talk to john.
???
well, sorry to be the one to break this to you, pal,
but john died more than two years ago.
who is this?
I'm his son.
Dean, look, best i can tell, adam milligan is real. Um, born september 29, 1990, to kate milligan.
no father listed on the birth certificate.
he's an eagle scout, graduated from high school with honors,
and currently goes to the university of wisconsin
biology major, pre-Med.
Dean? You listening?
this is a trap.
Dean, i'm telling you -- The kid checks out.
great, so he's an actual person on the planet earth.
sucks he's got a demon in him.
Hi. Welcome to cousin oliver's. - thanks - Can i -- - We're actually waiting on somebody.
thank you.
what are you
holy water? - Yep
one sip of jesus juice, this evil bitch is gonna be in a world of hurt.
and what if he's not possessed?
then he is a shapeshifter.
hence the silver.
look, either way, this thing is gonna bleed. I mean, using dad as bait?
that's the last mistake of its short, pitiful life.
what?
what? - Dean...
listen -- There's an entry in dad's journal From january of 1990
saying he's headed to minnesota to check out a case.
that's, roughly, oh, about nine months before the kid was born.
coincidenc - coincidenc
next two pages of the journal
torn out.
you're not ?? buying this, ???
?? to believe ??? I'm just saying it's possible.
I mean, dad would be gone for weeks at a time,
and he wasn't exactly a monk.
I mean, a hunter rolls into town,
uh, kills a monster, saves the girl...
sometimes the girl's grateful.
well, now i'm thinking about dad sex. Stop talking.
maybe he slipped one past the goalie.
dude!
you sam?
Yeah. Uh, this is dean.
Hi.
so um...
...how ?? my dad?
uh, we worked together.
how did he die? - On the job.
he was a mechanic, right? - A car fell on him.
Hey, adam. How you doing?
Oh, i'll take that. I am very thirsty.
the usual, adam?
uh, yeah. Thanks, denise.
so, uh...
when's the last time you -- You saw john?
I don't even know. It's...a couple years.
w-why did you decide to call him now?
I didn't know who else to call.
he's the only family i got.
my mom's missing.
Really? I'm sorry. Uh, for how long?
it's tragic -- Really.
but if you're john's kid, Hocome we've never heard of you?
cause john and me didn't really know each other.
not until a few years ago, anyway.
what do you mean? - My mom never talked about him.
I knew some stuff. - What kind of stuff?
?? nurse, And ???
hunting accident or something.
and i knew his name -- John winchester.
that's about it. We're not exactly a nuclear family.
Yeah, well, who is these days?
so, when did you, uh, when did you finally meet him?
when i was 12.
my mom had one of his old numbers, and...
and after i begged her -- God, 247
she finally called him.
God, when john heard he had a son, he raced to town.
I mean, he dropped everything. He drove all night.
there you go. - Thanks.
well, that's heartwarming.
you mind? - No, please -- Dig in.
he would swing by once a year or so,
you know, called when he could. But still...
he taught me poker and pool And even bought me my first beer when i was 15.
and, uh...
he showed me how to drive. Dad
he had this beautiful '67 impala.
Oh, this is crap. You know what -- You're lying.
no, i'm not. - Uh, yeah, you are.
I'm sorry, but who the hell are you to call me a liar?
we're john winchester's sons, that's who.
we are his sons.
I've got brothers? - No, you don't have brothers.
look, man, i don't know if you're a hunter Or what kind of game you're playing here.
I have never been hunting in my life.
whatever. I'm out of here. Come on, sam.
I can prove it.
he took you to a baseball game?
Yeah, when i turned 14.
dad was around for a few of my birthdays.
september 29, 2004.
one word -- "Minnesota.
he took you to a freakin' baseball game?
Yeah,
Why? What'd dad do with you on your birthday?
Oh...
Adam, you said you called dad because your mom was missing.
Yeah. - How long has she been gone?
three days.
who was the last person to see her?
Mr. Abbinanti, our neighbor.
he saw her come home tuesday night,
but she never showed up to work on wednesday.
did you call the police? - Mom's supervisor at the hospital did.
and then i drove down here as fast as i could.
I should have been here.
What'd the, uh, what'd the cops say?
that they, uh, they searched the house.
they didn't find anything.
she wouldn't leave without telling anybody.
it's like she just dropped off the face of the earth, you know?
the, uh, nightstand was knocked over. Was there anything else?
Oh, not really. The sheriff said there's no sign of a break-In.
what -- You think the cops missed something?
maybe.
they don't have my eyes.
you're a mechanic.
Yeah. That's right.
Dean, what else can you tell me about dad?
you knew him.
not as well as you.
trust me, kid
you don't want to know.
give us a minute.
you talk to the cops?
Yeah. Like adam said, no leads on his mom.
Ocker there. - But i did find this. Um...
here.
in 1990, there were 17 grave robberies in windom.
you think that's why dad came through here?
I'd say so. Check it out.
all right, so he was hunting something. What?
??? se-Snatchinghoa were the pages started up again --Journal.
but last month, ???
??? Bodies from the local cemetery.
so whatever heer??? , he didn't kill it. It's back.
and...What -- It's stepped up its game to fresh meat? I mean, kate's missing, and, uh...
so is a local bartender -- A guy named joe barton.
Hey, does your mom know joe barton?
uh, i don't think so. Why?
what is it? - Watch out.
give me a hand with the mattress.
every time.
why didn ??? paper?
who the hell are you?
Adam, hey. Take it easy.
no, don't tell me to take it easy, okay?
my house is a crime scene, my mom's probably dead, And you two
well, you tell me to call the cops, But you got to bail before they show?
so, who are you really?
cops didn't know where to look for my mom, dean, but you did.
and i heard you talking earlier -- Something about grave robberies.
you're not mechanics.
I just want to know what's going on.
please.
we're hunters.
Sammy! - He deserves to know, dean.
what do you mean, "hunters"?
okay, so...
Godzilla's" just a movie.
we hunt them.
so did dad.
okay.
okay"? That's it?
what am i supposed to say?
that we're liars, that we're crazy.
nobody just says "okay.
you're my brothers.
you're telling me the truth, right?
Yeah. - Then i believe you.
now, what took my mom?
we're not sure.
something's in town stealing bodies -- Living and dead
but we don't know what.
there's a long list of freaks that fit the bill.
you think maybe she might still be alive?
Oh.
how can i help?
you can't.
this thing killed my mom. If you're hunting it, i want in.
no. - Dean, look, maybe
maybe what?
he lost his mother. Maybe we can understand what that feels like.
why do you think dad never told us about this kid, sam?
huh? Why do you think he ripped out the pages?
because -- - Because he was protecting him!
dad's dead, dean.
that doesn't matter!
he didn't want adam to have our lives, okay?
and we'anre gonna respect s wishcb.
do i get a say in this? no! - no - Basid??? - Whe g?
I'm going out!
is he always like that?
welcome to the family.
here.
I'm gonna teach you a few things.
uh, dean said
I know what dean said.
and i know what it's like to want revenge.
this tomb was built in 1926.
four generations of the millsap family were interred here.
they don't build 'em like this anymore.
tell me, agent nugent, have you thought about Where you might like to spend eternity?
all the damn time.
so, three bodies went missing. Any idea who did it?
hooligans -- Sick, deranged hooligans.
this isn't blood. What is this?
no, it's embalming fluid.
whoever committed this crime didn't just take the corpses.
they opened them up.
firsbeer's on the house fops. ???
??????? Cbhat ss? E l esanyoveot at "w ???
so, what's the fbi doing in windom?
I'ing to the dippearance of jn.
I assume you knew him?
a little.
I'm his wife. Lisa.
well, ???
same thing can you tell me i told the sheriff. Sappearance?
he stayed late friday before last to do inventory
never came home.
d the police?
nothing.
uth is, i was scared they stopped looking.
but now you're he joe was a cop?
for a little wle.
at was a long time ago.
he didn'het happen to work the, uh, te, e
the grave-Y case '90?
he did. Yeah.
Joe was the one who found those bodies.
he got an award for that.
that was an interesting case.
he ever tell you how he did it?
most of the time, he said good, solid police work.
but after a few beers, he'd admit he had a little help.
from who?
a "specialist" -- T"'s all he'd say.
cops ever find the guy that stole the bodies?
no.
but when i asked joe about it, he'd say not to worry
that "we took care of what done it.
how did dad really die?
demon.
you hunted it down?
got revenge?
Dean killed it.
so it's over for you.
it's never over.
what the -- - Shh.
stay here.
It'itin t vents t
go!
Where's your car?
over here.
???
here.
Dean, help!
I winged it. Did you see anything?
I didn't get a good look.
what the hell is this thing?
why -- Who -- Should we go after it?
no, no.
in that maze? That thing's long gone.
all right, so, we don't know what it is, But we do know who it's going after
Joe barton, adamo's mom. - and adam.
it was under his truck, just waiting for him.
it set a trap, and i walked right into it.
doesn't matter. You're right -- There's a pattern.
Joe barton was a cop.
I'm pretty sure he helped out dad. So we've got him, dad's girl...
and his son.
all the people dad knew in town.
at least we know why it's back.
it wants revenge.
grab your stuff. We'll hit the road.
we shouldn't leave.
Yeah, let's stay here, the kid's mom got gankgot - Good one. - I'm serious.
no, sam, we're gonna take the kid, We're gonna drop him off at bobby's,
are gonna come back here And finish what dad started.
how?
we got no leads, no witnesses.
we do have what this thing wants.
you want to use the kid as bait?
that's why you want to stay here?
maybe this thing will come back. We could train adam
get him ready.
he could die, sam.
we could all die, dean.
even if we do kill this thing, There are tons of other freaks that want revenge
on dad, on us.
what if they find the kid instead and he's not ready?
I'll do it.
whatever it takes, i'll do it.
I want to do it.
whoa. - It's easy.
just feel the recoil and time the trigger pulls.
three taps.
yeah? - Go ahead.
beginner's luck, right?
Nah, man. You're a natural.
good shooting. - Thanks.
so, then we lit it on fire.
with a homemade flamethrower?
Yeah. They're easy to build.
I'll show you.
that is some job you got, man.
being a hunter isn't a job, adam.
it's life.
you're pre-Med. you got a girlfriend, friends?
not anymore you don't.
if you're really gonna do this,
you can't have those kinds of connections -- Ever.
they're weaknesses.
you'll just put those people in danger -- Get them killed.
that's the price we pay.
you cut 'em out, and you don't look back.
there's only one thing you can count on
family.
can i talk to you?
what the hell was that?
what?
hunting is life. You can't have connections.
dad gave you that exact same speech, remember?
it was just before you ditched us for stanford.
you hated dad for saying that stuff, And now you're quoting him?
Yeah, well... turns out dad was right.
since when? - Since always.
Dean, when i look at adam, you know what i see?
a normal kid. - No. Meat.
because the demons and monsters out there, That's all he is.
I hated dad for a long time. ??
but now i think i understand.
so we didn't have a dog and a white picket fence.
so what? Dad did right by us.
he taught us how to protect ourselves.
Adam deserves the same.
listen to yourself, man. - You think i'm wrong?
I think it's too late for us.
this is our life. This is who we are, okay?
and it's fine. I accept that. But with adam, he's still got a chance, man. He can go to school.
he could be a doctor. - What makes adam so special?
what, are you jealous of the kid? - Are you?
all this...
it's not real.
the dad adam knew -- He wasn't real.
the things out there in the shadows -- They are real.
the world is coming to an end. That's real.
everything else is just part of the crap People tell themselves to get through the day.
dad didn't have a choice with us, okay? But with adam, he did.
Adam doesn't have to be cursed. - He's a winchester.
he's already cursed.
no.
no, whatever's hunting adam, i'm gonna find it.
you already looked everywhere, dean. - Well, then i'll look again.
?? S cb home sweet h scb
sloppy joe.
Oh, son of a bitch!
son of a bitch.
all right.
we've closed off every other way into the house.
if this thing's coming, it's coming through there.
you were saying?
?? - Mom?
no. - Mom!
mom.
Adam, no! Wait!
it took me, but i got away.
?? - I got away.
Adam, step away from her.
Sam, what the hell?!
she's not your mother!
Adam, who -- What is going on?
get away from him! - What is going on?
you listen to me. - It's really her, okay?
there was too much blood. Your mother's dead.
there was too much blood in the vents!
shoot it! - He's crazy! It's me!
look -- Adam! - It's me!
that's not your mother!
?? - Shoot it! It's not human!
I know.
silver.
??
you're not shapeshifters.
you know, i find that term racist.
fresh meat. So much better than what we're used to.
I should have known.
it was the fresh kills that threw me.
ghouls don't usually go after the living.
see, you're just filthy scavengers, Feeding off the dead
taking the form of the last corpse you choke down.
and their thoughts. And their memories.
like adam, for instance.
well, we are what we eat. - You're monsters.
you know, you use that word a lot, sam.
but i don't think you know what it means.
his blood -- It tastes different.
our father was a monster?
Why?
because of what he ate?
he never hurt anyone, sam.
living, anyway.
no.
he was no monster.
but the thing that killed him was.
a monster named john winchester.
holy crap.
?? Thanks ur daddy, ?? brother and i grew up on our own.
at least we had each other.
like you and your brother
inseparable.
actually, it was very hard to get you on your own.
like you said, sam, the only thing you can count on is family.
and for 20 years, we lived like rats.
graveyard after graveyard, all that stinking flesh.
then we thought, "hey, why not move up to fresher game?
and we knew just where to start.
revenge -- It's never over, is it, sam?
first, it was john's cop friend,
and then his slut, and then his son.
then i called john, but...
the son of a bitch was already dead.
so i guess you and dean will have to do instead.
Dean won't interrupt us this time.
we're gonna feed on you nice and slow
like we did with adam.
Oh, and, by the way,
he really was your brother.
you should know that.
he was still alive when we took our first bites.
and he was a screamer.
Sam, the more you struggle, The faster you're gonna bleed out.
so you might as well lie back and relax.
Hey!
Dean, they're ghouls!
which means head-Shot.
?? Come on. Come on. Come on.
hang on.
all right, here we go.
here we go.
hang ouddy.
?? Ght. All right.
thank you.
that's what family's for, right?
keep pressure on that.
you sure we should do this?
ghouls didn't fake those pictures.
they didn't fake dad's journal.
Adam was our brother.
he died like a hunter. He deserves to go out like one.
maybe we can bring him back...
get ahold of cass, call in a favor.
no, adam's in a better place.
you know, i finally get why you and dad butted heads so much.
you two were practically the same person.
I mean, i worshipped the guy, you know?
I-I dressed like him, i acted like him,
I listen to the same music.
but you were more like him than i will ever be.
and i see that now.
I'll take that as a compliment.
you take it any way you want.
Lilith is trying to break the 66 seals
to free lucifer from hell. Lucifer will bring the apocalypse.
you're possessing some poor bastard?
this is...a vessel.
I had to give my consent to invite him in.
we have a life. You've been using it to write your books.
Dean, let him go. - This man is to be protected.
Why? - He's a prophet of the lord.
who are you? - I'm zachariah. I'm castiel's superior.
and how am i gonna ice lilith? - You're not.
Lilith's going to break the final seal.
you don't want to stop it, do you?
you are chosen. You will stop it.
just...not lilith or the apocalypse, that's all.
I'm sorry.
Sammy, let's go. - Dean...
he's coming.
come on.
what the devil is your name?
sa-- s-s-- uh...s-s-- yo-yosemite sam!
yosemite sam?
hmm, let's see. Sam...Ah, here it is.
what the hell?
I don't know.
folks, quick word from the flight deck.
we're just passing over ilchester, then ellicott city,
on our initial descent into baltimore...
Ilchester? Weren't we just there?
so if you'd like to stretch your legs,
now would be a good time to
holy crap!
saying it's very unlikely an abandoned convent Would be a target for terrorists, - Either foreign or homegrown. - Change the station.
hurricane kinley,
unexpectedly slamming into the galveston area...
...announced a successful test Of the north korean nuclear...
...baffled... ...swine flu...
Dean -- Don't. Don't say anything.
it's okay.
we just got to keep our heads down And hash this out, all right?
Yeah, okay.
all right, well, first things first --How did we end up on "soul plane"?
angels, maybe?
I mean, you know, beaming us out of harm's way?
well, whatever. It's the least of our worries.
we need to find cass.
Geez!
Yeah! - Hey, chuck.
so... You're okay?
well, my head hurts.
no, i mean -- i mean, my -- my last vision.
you went, like, full-on vader.
your body temperature was 150. Your heart rate was 200.
your eyes were black.
your eyes went black?
I didn't know.
Where's cass?
he's dead. Or gone.
the archangel smote the crap out of him. I'm sorry.
you're sure? I mean, maybe he just vanished into the light or something.
Oh, no. He, like, exploded.
like a water balloon of chunky soup.
you got a...
uh...right here?
uh, the...
Oh, god.
is that a molar?
do i have a molar in my hair?
this has been a really stressful day.
Cass, you stupid bastard.
stupid? He was trying to help us.
Yeah, exactly.
so, what now? I don't know.
Oh, crap.
what?
I can feel them.
thought we'd find you here.
playtime's over, dean. Time to come with us.
you just keep your distance, ass-hat.
you're upset.- Yeah -- a little.
you sons of bitches jump-started judgment day!
maybe we let it happen. We didn't start anything.
right, sammy?
you had a chance to stop your brother, and you couldn't.
so let's not quibble over who started what.
let's just say it was all our faults and move on.
cause like it or not...
...It's apocalypse now.
and we're back on the same team again. - Is that so?
you want to kill the devil. We want you to kill the devil.
It's...synergy.
and i'm just supposed to trust you?
cram it with walnuts, ugly.
this isn't a game, son.
Lucifer is powerful in ways that defy description.
we need to strike now, hard and fast
before he finds his vessel.
his vessel?
Lucifer needs a meat suit?
he is an angel.
them's the rules.
and when he touches down, We're talking four horsemen, red oceans, fiery skies
the greatest hits.
you can stop him, dean.
but you need our help.
you listen to me, you two-faced douche
after what you did, i don't want jack squat from you!
you listen to me, boy!
you think you can rebel against us?
as lucifer did?
you're bleeding.
Oh, yeah.
a little insurance policy in case you dicks showed up.
No!
learned that from my friend cass, you son of a bitch.
this sucks ass.
here.
hex bags. No way the angels will find us with those.
demons, either, for that matter.
Where'd you get it? - I made it.
how?
I... I learned it from ruby.
speaking of...
how you doing?
are you jonesing for another hit of bitch blood or what?
I-it's weird. Uh, tell you the truth, i'm fine.
no shakes, no fever. It's like whoever...
put me on that plane cleaned me right up.
supernatural methadone.
Yeah, i guess.
it's okay. You don't have to say anything.
well, that's good.
because what can i even say?
I'm sorry"? "i screwed up"?
doesn't really do it justice, you know?
look, there's nothing i can do or say That will ever make this right
so why do you keep bringing it up?!
look, all i'm saying is,
why do we have to put this under a microscope?
we made a mess. We clean it up. That's it.
all right, so, say this is just any other hunt.
you know? What do we do first?
we'd, uh, figure out where the thing is.
all right. So we just got to find...
the devil.
all right, keep it together.
keep it together, man.
it's you, nick.
you're special.
you're chosen.
and then sam touched
no.
...caressed dean's clavicle.
this is wrong,' said dean.
then i don't want to be right,'
replied sam, in a husky voice.
Oh...my...god.
you.
you're... - Carver edlund, yeah. Hi, becky.
you got my letters.
and my marzipan.
Yeah, yeah. Um...yummy. But, uh
I am your number-one fan.
you know, i'm samlicker81.
I'm sorry. You're -- you're what?
Webmistress at morethanbrothers. net?
Oh, yeah. No, yeah. You're my...number-one fan.
that's why i contacted you.
you're the only one who will believe me.
are you all right?
no.
I'm being watched.
okay, not now -- at least, i don't think so.
but i don't have much time.
I need your help.
you need my help?
that's right.
I need you to get a message to sam and dean.
okay?
look, mr. Edlund...
Yes, i'm a fan, but i really don't appreciate being mocked.
I know that "supernatural's" just a book, okay?
I know the difference between fantasy and reality.
Becky, it's all real.
I knew it!
but then how would you explain an earthquake,
a hurricane, and multiple tornadoes,
all at the same time, all around the globe?
two words -- carbon emissions.
Yeah, right, wavy gravy.
you okay, lady?
Sam...is it really you?
and you're so firm.
do i know you?
no. But i know you.
you're sam winchester.
and you're...
...not what i pictured.
I'm becky.
I read all about you guys.
and i've even written a few
anyway...
Mr. Edlund told me where you were.
he's got a message, but he's being watched.
angels.
nice change-up to the mythology, by the way.
the demon stuff was getting kind of old.
right. Just, um... What's the message?
he had a vision.
the michael sword is on earth. The angels lost it.
the michael sword?
Becky, does he know where it is?
in a castle, on a hill made of 42 dogs.
42 dogs?
are...you sure you got that right?
it doesn't make sense, but that's what he said.
I memorized every word...
for you.
um...
Becky, c-- uh, can you...quit touching me?
no.
Hey, bobby.
good to see you boys all in one piece.
you weren't followed, were you?
you mean by angels, Demons, or sam's new superfan?
you heard. - I heard, romeo.
so... Sword of michael, huh?
you think we're talking about the actual sword From the actual archangel?
you better friggin' hope so.
that's michael -- toughest sumbitch they got.
you kidding me? Tough?
that guy looks like cate blanchett.
well, i wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley, believe me.
he commands the heavenly host.
during the last big dust-up upstairs,
he's the one who booted lucifer's ass to the basement.
did it with that sword.
so if we can find it...
we can kick the devil's ass all over again.
all right. So, where do we start?
divvy up and start reading
try and make sense of chuck's nonsense.
kid?
you all right?
no, actually.
Bobby, this is all my fault. I'm sorry.
Lilith did not break the final seal.
Lilith was the final seal.
Sam, stop it.
I killed her, and i set lucifer free.
you what?! - You guys warned me about ruby,
the demon blood, but i didn't listen.
I brought this on.
you're damn right you didn't listen.
you were reckless and selfish and arrogant.
I'm sorry. - Oh, yeah?
you're sorry you started armageddon?
this kind of thing don't get forgiven, boy.
if, by some miracle, we pull this off...
I want you to lose my number.
you understand me?
there's an old church nearby.
maybe i'll go read some of the lore books there.
Yeah.
you do that.
I never would have guessed that your daddy was right.
about what? - About your brother.
what john said
you save sam or kill him.
maybe...
maybe what?
maybe we shouldn't have tried so hard to save him.
he ended the world, dean.
and you and i weren't strong enough to stop him proper.
that's on us.
your dad's right.
dad.
it's got to be in here somewhere.
what the hell are you talking about?
here. i don't believe it. I don't believe it.
what the hell is it?
it's a card for my dad's lockup in upstate new york. Read it.
castle storage. 42 rover hill.
castle on a hill of 42 dogs.
so you think your dad had the michael sword all this time?
I don't know. I'm not sure what else chuck could have meant.
Yeah.
okay.
it's good enough for me.
I always knew you were a big, dumb, slow, Dim pain in the ass, dean.
but i never dreamt you were so v. i.p.
I mean, you're gonna ice the devil?
you?
if i'd have known that, I'd have ripped your pretty, pretty face off ages ago.
try again. Go back further.
these are the days of miracle and wonder, dean.
our father's among us.
you know we're all dreaming again For the first time since we were human?
it's heaven on earth.
or hell.
we really owe your brother a fruit basket.
my god, you like the sound of your own voice.
but you, on the other hand,
you're the only bump in the road.
so every demon -- every single one
is just dying for a piece of you.
get in line. - Oh, i'm in the front of the line, baby.
let's ride.
what is that -- peanut butter?
you know, your surrogate daddy's still awake
screaming in there.
and i want him to know how it feels Slicing the life out of you.
No!
now!
No!
Heya, sammy.
you miss me? 'Cause i sure missed you.
it's not so easy without those super-special demon powers, Huh, sammy?
No!
N-No! No! No! No! No, god, no!
need some help here!
what happened? - He was stabbed.
can we get a gurney?
just wait here.
no, no, we -- we can't just leave him!
just don't move. I've got questions.
Sammy, we got to go. - No. No way, dean.
the demons heard where the sword is.
we got to get to it before they do, If we're not too late already.
come on!
I see you told the demons where the sword is.
Oh, thank god. The angels are here.
and to think...
they could have grabbed it any time they wanted.
it was right in front of them.
what do you mean? - We may have planted that particular piece of prophecy
inside chuck's skull, but it happened to be true.
we did lose the michael sword.
we truly couldn't find it.
until now. You've just hand-delivered it to us.
we don't have anything.
it's you, chucklehead.
you're the michael sword.
what, you thought you could actually kill lucifer?
you simpering wad of insecurity and self-loathing?
no.
you're just a human, dean.
and not much of one.
what do you mean, i'm the sword?
you're michael's weapon.
or, rather, his...receptacle.
I'm a vessel?
you're the vessel.
Michael's vessel.
how? Why -- why me?
because you're chosen!
it's a great honor, dean.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, life as an angel condom.
that's real fun.
I think i'll pass, thanks.
joking. Always joking.
well... No more jokes.
bang. - God!
you son of a bitch!
keep mouthing off, i'll break more than his legs.
I am completely and utterly through screwing around.
the war has begun. We don't have our general.
that's bad.
now, michael is going to take his vessel
and lead the final charge against the adversary.
you understand me?
how many humans die in the crossfire, huh?
a million? 5, 10?
probably more. If lucifer goes unchecked, you know how many die?
all of them. He'll roast the planet alive.
there's a reason you're telling me this
instead of just nabbing me.
you need my consent.
michael needs my say-so to ride around in my skin.
unfortunately, yes.
well, there's got to be another way.
there is no other way.
there must be a battle.
michael must defeat the serpent. It is written.
Yeah, maybe.
but, on the other hand...
eat me.
the answer's no.
okay.
how about this?
your friend bobby -- we know he's gravely injured.
uh, say yes, and we'll heal him.
say no, he'll never walk again.
no.
then how about we heal you from...
Stage-4 stomach cancer?
no.
then let's get really creative.
uh, let's see how... Sam does without his lungs.
are we having fun yet?
you're going to say yes, dean.
just kill us.
kill you?
Oh, no.
I'm just getting started.
how are you...
alive?
that's a good question.
how did these two end up on that airplane?
another good question.
cause the angels didn't do it.
I think we both know the answer, don't we?
no.
that's not possible.
it scares you.
well, it should.
now, put these boys back together and go.
I won't ask twice.
you two need to be more careful.
Yeah, i'm starting to get that.
your frat brothers are bigger dicks than i thought.
I don't mean the angels.
Lucifer is circling his vessel.
and once he takes it, Those hex bags won't be enough to protect you.
what the hell was that?
an enochian sigil.
it'll hide you from every angel in creation, - Including lucifer. - What, you just brand us with it?
no. I carved it into your ribs.
Hey, cass, were you really dead?
Yes.
then how are you back?
you're dreaming, nick.
but it doesn't mean this isn't real.
I'm not your wife, nick.
I'm an angel.
an angel?
my name is lucifer.
sure.
naturally.
Um...could you do me a favor there, satan,
and remind me to quit drinking before i go to bed?
I'm here because you're special, nick.
there's very, very few people like you.
is that so?
you're a vessel -- a very powerful vessel.
meaning what, exactly?
I need to take control of your mind and your body.
to be honest...
it'll probably be unpleasant for you.
but it is necessary.
okay, look...
if it's just the same to you, i think i'd like to wake up now.
I told you -- this is real.
don't be afraid.
this is your choice.
you need to invite me in.
even if this is real --Which it's not, but assuming it was
why the hell would i do something like that?
you people misunderstand me.
you call me "satan" and "devil," but...
do you know my crime?
I loved god too much.
and for that, he betrayed me
punished me.
just as he's punished you.
after all, how could god stand idly by While that man broke into your home
and butchered your family in their beds?
there are only two rational answers, nick
either he's sadistic...
or he simply doesn't care.
you're angry.
you have every right to be angry.
I am angry, too.
that's why i want to find him
hold him accountable for his actions.
just because he created us Doesn't mean he can toy with us, like playthings.
if i help you...
can you bring back my family?
I'm sorry.
I can't.
but i can give you the next best thing.
God did this to you, nick.
and i can give you justice.
peace.
how do i know you're telling the truth?
because, contrary to popular belief,
I don't lie.
I don't need to.
what i need...
is you.
Nick, i need you to say yes.
then yes.
BOBBY: "unlikely to walk again"?!
why, you snot-nosed son of a bitch!
wait till i get out of this bed!
I'll use my game leg and kick your friggin' ass!
Yeah, you better run!
you believe that yahoo?
screw him. You'll be fine.
Sam: so, let me ask the million-dollar question.
what do we do now?
well...we save as many as we can for as long as we can, i guess.
it's bad.
whoever wins, heaven or hell, we're boned.
what if we win?
I'm serious.
I mean, screw the angels and the demons And their crap apocalypse.
they want to fight a war, they can find their own planet.
this one's ours, and i say they get the hell off it.
we take 'em all on. We kill the devil. Hell, we even kill michael if we have to.
but we do it our own damn selves.
and how are we supposed to do all this, genius?
I got no idea.
but what i do have is a g. e.d.
and a "give 'em hell" attitude, and i'll figure it out.
you are nine kinds of crazy, boy.
it's been said.
listen, you stay on the mend.
we'll see you in a bit.
I was awake.
I know what i said back there.
I just want you to know that...
that was the demon talking.
I ain't cutting you out, boy.
not ever.
Thanks, bobby.
you're welcome.
I deserve a damn medal for this,
but...you're welcome.
you know, i was thinking, dean
maybe we could go after the colt.
Why? What difference would that make?
well, we could use it on lucifer. I mean, you just said back there
I just said a bunch of crap for bobby's benefit.
I mean... I'll fight.
I'll fight till the last man, but let's at least be honest.
I mean, we don't stand a snowball's chance, And you know that.
I mean, hell, you of all people know that.
is there something you want to say to me?
I tried, sammy.
I mean, i really tried.
but i just can't keep pretending that everything's all right.
because it's not.
and it's never going to be.
you chose a demon over your own brother,
and look what happened.
I would give anything -- anything
to take it all back. - I know you would.
and i know how sorry you are. I do.
but, man...
you were the one that i depended on the most.
and you let me down in ways that i can't even...
I'm just --I'm having a hard time forgiving and forgetting here.
you know?
what can i do?
honestly?
nothing.
I just don't...
I don't think that we can ever be what we were.
you know?
I just don't think i can trust you.
Hey, BABE.
nice to see you, too.
honey?
are you okay?
you expect me to believe you're CDC?
excuse me?
it's just that you're a day early.
first time in history I haven't sat on my ass waiting for you people.
new administration.
a change you can believe in. -Right.

date of birth -- April 3, 1984.
I know.
I ran the dna twice. That's definitely him.
well, he wasn't big on the sunscreen, huh?
so, what's your theory?
all I know is, decedent's male, 25 years old,
and he died of old age.
you were right about this one. It's definitely a job.
thought so.

how long has he been missing?
Oh, I knew right away When he didn't come home Tuesday night.

a favorite bar?
no. Tuesdays, he always works a bit late,
but he always comes straight home.
may I use your facilities, ma'am?
working late," my ass.
well, at least he's consistent.
same room every tuesday, hourly rates.
hope I got that kind of kick when I'm his age.
Yeah, like either of us will live that long.
true.
so... what do you think's in there?
a wrinkly, gooey corpse.
Oh, god! oh, god! Oh! Oh, god!
what the...
Oh. God.
it's gooey.
sorry. Got the wrong room.
close the door!
nice tattoo.

never heard of him.
well, that's weird.
cause you're carrying his wallet.
your wife told us about your, uh, birthmark there. That's nice.
well, you look great, Cliff.
did you get some work done?
could you give us some privacy?
Thanks. Thanks. Bye.
please don't tell my wife.
slow down. -I'm begging you. as far as she knows, I'm dead.
for the love of god, let's keep it that way.
how can you possibly be Cliff Whitlow?
I can't tell you.
well, either you tell us or we tell the missus.
okay! Okay! It was a game.
what's xbox?
what is that supposed to mean?
look, I know it sounds crazy.
guy comes up to me at a bar, invites me to play.
gives me 25 of these weirdo poker chips, right?
chants some mumbo humbo over them, Says now they're 25years.
I'm laughing... But then I come out up.
and look at me.
what was he chanting?
how should I know?
all I know is, my bad hip's good, I threw away my glasses.
one of those ladies was here for free!
man's some kind of miracle worker.
what does this miracle worker look like?
just a guy. Maybe 35, brown hair.
irish accent. His name was patrick.
all right, all right. Where's this game at?
he said he likes to keep moving. Never stays in one bar long.
and he finds you.
thank you, cliff.
Oh, and, uh... Stay classy.
it sounds crazy, right?
no. there's lore on it.
goes back centuries.
traveling card player pops into town.
you beat him, you get your best years back.
course, most folks lose.
well, that would explain the crunchy corpse.
supposedly, this player's a hell of a card shark.
got a lot of years in the bank.
you find the bar he's working in yet?
there's a lot of dives in this town.
we're gonna have to split up.
well, why you still talking to me?

Yeah, a whole bunch of squat. You?
no, not a thing.
all right.
well, you come up dry, circle back to the motel in two.

you wouldn't happen to know of a poker game Going on in back, would you?
it's a bar, not a casino.
my friend Ben told me you'd know.
don't know any Ben. -Sure you do.
you know, balding, smart-ass, real ladies' man?
listen, pal, I told you -- I don't know any Ben.
I don't know nothing about a game.
you sure?'Cause, uh... ...
he sure seems to know you.
round back. Take the elevator down.
what the hell are you doing here?
planting daisies. What's it look like?

And? -I lost.

25

she used to be a dancer.
not much of a drinker.
very independent.
looking for adventure.
Hey, man. Excuse me.
can I borrow you for a sec?
of course. Great. Good to see you.
would you two please excuse me?
sorry to cut you short With mr. And mrs. Easy marks over there.
Oh, no big. Wasn't a total loss.

you owe my friend some years.
Oh, that's what this is.
I'm sorry. He lost. Them's the breaks.

lozenge?

dude, relax. It's me.
Hi.
what the hell happened?
I, you know... found the game.
you f-- I thought you said you were g-good at poker.
I am. Shut up.
so, you were just gonna shoot some old guy? Is that it?
I didn't know what you were. I mean, h-have you seen you?
you look like -- The old chick in "titanic. I know. Shut up.
I was gonna say "emperor palpatine.
I see you met John Mccain there.
either of youf want to tell me what happened?
Bobby's an idiot. That's what happened.
Hey, nobody asked you to play.
right. I should have just let you die.
and for damn sure, nobody asked you to lose!
it's like "grumpy old men.
shut up, Sam!
what the hell were you thinking?
he's a witch.
he's been playing poker since guys wore tights.
you just don't get it.
Yeah, I get it, bobby.
you saw a chance to turn the hands of the clock back
and get out of that damn chair.
pretty tempting.
I can imagine.
no, you can't.
you got me. I never been paralyzed.
but I tell you something -- I've been to hell,
and there's an archangel there wanting me to drop the soap.
look at me! My junk's rustier than yours!
you hear me bellyaing? huh?
A-actually, yeah.
I'm having a heart attack.
no, you're not.
what is it? - Acid reflux.
guys your age can't digest certain foods.
you're gonna need to put down that cheeseburger.
so, you want to keep emoting
or you want to talk about solving this little issue of yours?
it's got to be about the chips.
I slid 'em across, Patrick did his little witchy number,
and you prettied up in a hurry.
I mean, what are you all thinking?
some kind of magic chips or something?
definitely.
you remember what he chanted?
Yep -- every word.
all right, then let's find out where he stashes his chips.
and steal me 50.
benjamin button me back into burger shape.
what do you think?
I think you ought to put some clothes on.
ready for housekeeping, sir?
born ready.
you're just like my grandfather.
he hits on anything that moves, too.
you're adorable.
and dangerous.
can we just go?
guys, get some help! He came out of nowhere!
what the hell?
I got to say, I kind of like the guy.
well, I'm out.
elevator out of order
dime-store model. Piece oj cake.
it's like "mission: pathetic. watch or Ii could have done that.
what are you doing?
Hey, babe. Aren't you the chick from the bar?
I'm a lot more than that.
it's all right, sweetheart. It's all right. they're harmless.
you boys want chips? Take 'em.
they're just chips, einsteins.
it's showmanship. This may come as a shock,
but the magic does not lie in a pile of crappy plywood
or in any phony abracadabra.
it's in the 900-year-old witch.
you boys want years?
score 'em the old-fashioned way. Texas hold 'em.
fine. Let's do it.
what card am I holding up?
that's what I thought.
if your eyesight's that bad, what about your memory?
I'm not a murderer.
you, on the other hand...
no, Sam. -Dean
what, Sam not much of a player?
okay, well, happy trails, Dean.
enjoy the twilight of your life.
should have taken better care of that ticker, though.
you're free to go.
Oh, but, Sam... Your brother's situation -- That's punishment enough,
but I can't let you leave Without a small parting gift.
what are you doing?
you'll find out soon enough.
let's get out of here, Sam.
dude...
I believe that he-witch gave you the clap.
little help here?
you know, I still think I should play.
no, no, no. You're not good enough.
I'm better. Bobby's way better. We both lost.
exactly. - So, what? So I don't get a say in this anymore?
Sammy, when you get to be our age -- - You're 30, Dean!
look, I've watched you hustle plenty of poker
knowing the game is not enough, Sam.
it's not about playing the cards.
it's about playing the other guy. I know that.
well, hooray for you. All I'm saying is, I played this guy.
I know his style. I can take him.
no, Bobby. You don't have enough years in the bank.
I got enough. - No, you'll die if you lose, Bobby.
so what if I do, huh?
what exactly am I living for, huh?!
the damn apocalypse?!
watching men die bloody while I sit in this chair,
can't take a step to help 'em?
Bobby... - No, no. It's the facts.
I'm old... And broke down...
and I can't...
I ain't a hunter no more.
I'm useless.
and if I wasn't such a coward,
I'd have stuck a gun in my mouth Day I got home from the hospital.
Bobby, you are not playing again.
I'm not... letting you do that.
there's another way out of this. There's got to be.
and I'm gonna find it.
take it. It'll help you.
what is this? - The most powerful reversal spell you've ever laid your eyes on.
and it reverses what?
Patrick's work -- all of it.
you -- you saying I could be normal again?
you and everyone else he's ever played.
who's still alive.
why the hell should we trust you?
trust me, don't trust me. I don't care.

and me, too.
I look good for my age.

why would you want that?
I have my reasons.
do it quick. We leave town tomorrow.

I sense you've got me by the jewels on this one, Hesh.
I fold.

Thanks, Patrick.
Hesh here is gonna live To see his granddaughter's bat mitzvah. Isn't that right, Hesh?
thanks again, Patrick. - Shalom, my friend. Shalom.

I'm a nice guy.
what can I do you for?

jawbone of a murderer.
great.
you know, this really sucks.

we don't. But we ain't got a plan "b.

one little grave.
then you do it.
fine. I'll hop right in.
well, least your legs are numb.
shut up and dig, grandma.

can you straighten up?
Yeah, but a little sympathy wouldn't hurt.
butt cheek tingling?
well, that's kind of personal.
so "yeah"?
it's sciatica. You'll live. Keep digging.
you know, Bobby... Killing you is officially on my bucket list.
I like you, Sam. I do.
you're smart, and your heart's clearly in the right place.
I can tell a lot about a guy by looking.
you mean you're psychic. - No. That'd be cheating.
I'm talking about good old-fashioned intuition.
right. Let's just play.
we are playing.
does your big brother know you're here?
bet five.
didn't think so.
I raise.
here you are, right...
trying to clean up their mess,
and they still want to sit you at the kiddie table.
you're not the little brother anymore, Sam.
then again... ...maybe you are.
you're in over your head here, Sam.
I mean, you can keep making these moves
you know... Playing it cautious, Playing the percentages.
but I'm still gonna kick your ass into the nursing home.
does this armchair-psychology routine Usually work for you?
you tell me. You're the one who's losing.
little break?
how's it going in there?
how do you think it's going?
what about you? You have everything you need?
we still need a little he-witch DNA.
he was chewing it. Hurry up, Dean. Please.
all right. Just keep him busy.
and, Sammy... Don't lose.
drop it in.
well? How do I look?
question -- Is this what you meant to give your big brother?
the one you gave him never passed my lips.
won't do a scrap of good.
I don't like cheating, Sam.
stop it! Patrick, let him go!
he tried to kill us! - I did it! I gave him the spell!
what?
why... Why would you do that?
you know why.
you know.
Keep...playing.
everything we put in that spell was kosher.
Yeah, everything except the damn toothpick.
you got to go get a speck of DNA.
strap on your track shoes.
Oh, goody. More stairs.
it's too damn clean in here.
first which I ever heard of Didn't spew bodily fluids all over the place.
toothbrush, comb -- anything.
well, look at you -- The percentage player betting the farm.
awful transparent of you, Sam.
I mean, if I had a monster hand like you have, I'd trap you.
but you get so excited, You bet yourself right out of a big pot.
I fold.
set of ladies, I'm guessing.
nice bluff.
if we had time, I could make a real player out of you.
I got time.
maybe.
but I can't say the same for Dean.
your brother's gonna be dead soon.
and when I say "soon..." I mean minutes.
the game's not over till I say it is.
blinds.
so, when it's about your brother, You get so emotional,
your brain just flies right out the window.
good to know. - Go to hell.
I'm all-in.
don't do that, Sam. - I can't leave until it's over?
fine. It's over. Now, where's my brother?
look, there's poker and then there's suicide. - Just play the hand.
Dean? Dean, you there?
fine.
I'm sorry, kid6 Aces full.
you're crying.
for a witch, you're so nice, it's actually kind of creepy.
it's okay.
it was a great hand.
just...
...not as great...
...as four 4s.
well played.
you know, that whole...
Going-out-of-your-head bit -- Very method.
well, there's more to you than meets the eye.
cash these in for Dean, please.
with pleasure.
Dean, you hear me?
damn it, Dean!
idjit.
Yes, you can.
don't make me.
I don't want to win.
I buried my daughter.
and she looked like this.
it's not natural.
you knew...
when you decided to come with me.
this is what you wanted.
you're still young. You're so beautiful. You have me.
I miss my family.
I'm sorry, Patrick.
I thought you loved me. - I do.
sweetheart, of course I do.
I thought I was cut out for this, But i'm not.
I don't think I can do this without you.
you got on okay for a long time before you met me.
check.
all-in.
all-in.
thank you.
no tricks -- you actually beat the guy?
how the hell?
just lucky.
Hey. I'll see y'all guys later. Where you going?
uh... Mm, nowhere.
a booster shot. Don't say it.
well, I guess we can get the van loaded.
I shouldn't have called you an idiot.
which time?
I'm sorry.
I mean, I actually -- I-I... I get it.
getting old ain't a bachelor party.
and dealing with the crap you got to deal with...
don't you go on pity patrol.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just...
I'm saying, you know, if I was in your shoes...
you'd never stop complaining.
fair enough.
you're not useless, Bobby.
okay. Good talk.
no, wait a minute. Listen to me.
you don't stop being a soldier 'Cause you got wounded in battle.
okay? No matter what shape you're in, Bottom line is, you're family.
I don't know if you've noticed,
but me and Sam, we don't have much left.
I can't do this without you.
I can't.
so don't you dare think about checking out.
I don't want to hear that again.
okay. - Okay.
good.
Thanks.
now, we done feeling our feelings?
cause I'd like to get out of this room Before we both start growing lady parts.
Yeah, we're done.
let's go, ironsides.
Oh, that one's sticking, huh?
??
I remember now. I'm an angel.
I have a death sentence on my head.
Why? - I disobeyed.
you really shouldn't have come.
you have to stop it. - Stop what?
1973? Mom?
my parents are Mary and John Winchester.
and I am your grandson.
Mary gets killed by a yellow-Eyed demon in 1983.
now, if we don't catch this thing now and kill it
and it gets away... then mary dies.
No!
I couldn't stop any of it. She still made the deal.
she still died in the nursery, didn't she?
destiny can't be changed, Dean.
all roads lead to the same destination.
???
cool drink of water such a sweet surprise! - Oh, I take it all back.
tastes so good make a grown man cry - I love the devil.
sweet cherry pie - Now, that's what i call peace on earth.
I was just, uh, working on a case.
this is what you dream about.
this is awkward.
why are you gate-crashing my head? Why don't you just swing by the motel?
I can't find you.
Oh. Cass did this thing.
Cass. Right.
now, there's a friend you can count on.
what?
he didn't tell you?
tell me what? - Where i've been.
of course not. Why would he?
where have you been?
prison.
upstairs.
all the torture, twice the self-righteousness.
why wouldn't he have told us where you were? - Cause he's the one who turned me in.
don't look so shocked. He was always a good little soldier.
did anything under orders. - I didn't know. Are you okay?
no. And I don't have long.
I broke out -- Barely.
they're looking for me.
if they find me -- - Okay. What do you need?
meet me. 225 industrial.
and, please, just hurry.
Hello?
who's there?
Hello, Anna.
well...
if i didn't know any better...
I'd say the Winchesters don't trust me.
they do. I don't.
I wouldn't let them come.
and why is that?
if you're out of prison, it's because they let you out.
and they sent you here to do their dirty work.
and what makes you so sure?
because I've experienced... heaven's persuasion.
you mean when you gave me to them.
that was a mistake.
Anna, whatever they sent you here to do -- - They didn't send me.
I escaped. - No one escapes.
all these centuries, and you're underestimating me now?
if you're not one of them, then what do you want?
I want to help.
you want to help? - Yes.
then what are doing with that knife?
I'm not allowed to defend myself?
against whom? That blade doesn't work against angels.
it's not like this one.
maybe you're not working for heaven. But there's something you're not telling me.
Sam Winchester has to die.
I am sorry. But we have no choice.
he's Lucifer's vessel.
he's not the only one. - What? That guy Nick?
he's burning away as we speak.
no.
Sam is the only vessel that matters.
you know what that means.
if lucifer can't take sam, his whole plan short-circuits.
no fight with michael, no croatoan virus,
the horsemen go back to their day jobs.
even if you could... kill sam, Satan would just bring him back to life.
not after I scatter his cells across the universe.
they'll never find him -- Not all of him.
we'll find another way.
how's that going?
how's the Colt working out? Or the search for god?
is anything working?
if you want to stop the devil, this is how.
the answer is still no.
?? Sam is my friend.
you've changed.
maybe too late.
but I have.
Anna, we've been through much together.
but you come near Sam Winchester,
and I'll kill you.
Oh, my god.
Hey. - Oh, my god.
you okay?
we have to get her to a hospital. Come on.
Really? Anna?
I don't believe it. - It's true.
so she's gone all glenn close, huh? That's awesome.
who's Glenn Close? - No one.
just this psycho bitch who likes to boil rabbits.
so, The -- The plan to kill me -- Would it actually stop Satan?
no, Sam, come on.
Cass, what do you think? Does Anna have a point?
no.
she's a... Glenn Close.
I don't get it. We're looking for the chick that wants to gank Sam?
why poke the bear?
Anna will keep trying.
she won't give up until Sam is dead.
so we kill her first.
I found her. - Where is she?
not where.
when.
it's 1978.
what?
why 1978? I wasn't even born yet.
you won't be... if she kills your parents.
what?
Anna can't get to you because of me.
so she's going after them. - Take us back right now.
and deliver you right to Anna? I should go alone.
they're our parents, Cass. We're going.
it's not that easy. - Why not?
time travel was difficult Even with the powers of heaven at my disposal.
but you're cut off.
so, what? You're like a delorean without enough plutonium.
I don't understand that reference.
but i'm telling you,
taking this trip, with passengers, no less...
...it'll weaken me.
they're our mom and dad.
if we can save them, and not just from Anna
I mean, if we can set things right...
we have to try.
ready?
not really. - Bend your knees.
did we make it?
unless they're bringing pintos back into production,
I, uh, I'd say yes.
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.
take it easy. Take it easy. You all right?
I'm fine.
I'm much better than I expected.
he's breathing... sort of.
what do we do?
I mean, the mustaches alone...
so I paid for cass for five nights up in the, uh, honeymoon suite.
I told the manager, "do not disturb no matter what."
you know what he said to me?
Yeah. Don't sweat it. Want to buy some dope?
dope.
we ought to stick around here, buy some stock in microsoft.
Yeah, we might have to if cass doesn't recover.
is he all right?
what do I look like -- Dr. Angel, medicine woman?
he'll wake up.
he's, you know, tough for a little nerdy dude with wings.
if he landed like that, hopefully, so did Anna.
should buy us some time. - So, did you find them?
Yeah. Uh...the Winchesters. 485 robin tree.
let's go pop in on the folks.
Sam. Sam. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Dean, Anna could be here any second.
what exactly are we gonna march up there and tell them?
uh, the truth.
what, that their sons are back from the future .To save them from an angel gone "terminator"?
come on. Those movies haven't even come out yet.
well, then tell her demons are after them. I mean, she thinks you're a hunter, right?
Yeah, a hunter who disappeared right when her dad died.
she's gonna love me.
just follow my lead.
how was work?
it was, uh, great.
Ah! Not until you wash up.
I love when you get bossy.
Hi, Mary.
you can't be here.
I'm sorry if this is a bad time. - You don't understand. I'm not...
I don't do that anymore.
I have a normal life now. You have to go.
I'm sorry, but this is important, okay?
sorry, sweetie, they're just...
Mary's cousins.
Yeah, we couldn't stop through town 。Without swinging by and saying "hey," now, could we?
you look familiar.
Really?
Yeah, you do, too, actually, you know?
we must have met sometime.
small towns, right? Got to love them.
I'm John.
this is Sam.
Sam. Uh, Mary's father was a Sam.
uh, it's a -- It's a family name.
you okay, pal? You look a little spooked.
Oh. Oh, yeah.
just a...long trip. - Yeah.
well, Sam and Dean were just on their way out.
what? They just got here.
real happy to meet folks from Mary's side.
please come on in for a beer.
twist my arm.
are you sure you're okay, Sam?
wow-- Oh.
Yeah, yeah. Um, I'm just, um...
you are so beautiful.
he means that in a non-Weird, Wholesome, family kind of a way.
Yeah, right. - We haven't seen Mary in
in quite some time, and
see, she's the spitting image of our mom.
I mean, it's -- It's -- Eerie.
so, how are you guys related?
you know, uh, distantly.
Oh. So you knew Mary's parents?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Mary's dad was, uh...
pretty much like a grandpa to us.
Oh.
that was tragic -- That heart attack.
Yes, it was.
so, uh, what are you guys doing in town, anyway?
uh, business, you know.
Oh, yeah? What line of work? - Plumbing. - Scrap metal.
Oh, gosh. It's almost 7: 00.
I hate to be rude, but I got to get dinner ready.
maybe they could stay. - I'm sure they have to leave.
uh, look, please stay.
you know, it would mean a lot to me.
I-I haven't met much of Mary's side of the family.
look, Mr. Woodson, I'm begging you to reconsider.
I'd like to, John. You're a great mechanic.
but times aren't exactly rosy.
even just part time. I really need this job.
all right, look. Come on in right now, let's talk.
maybe we can figure something out.
you serious?
I'll see you in 10 minutes. Don't keep me waiting.
you have to leave. Now.
okay, just listen -- - No, you listen.
last time i saw you, a demon killed my parents.
now you waltz in here like you're family?
whatever you want -- No. Leave me alone.
you and John are in danger.
what are you talking about? - Something's coming for you.
demon? - Not exactly.
well, what, then?
it's kind of hard to explain, okay? It's -- It's
an angel.
what?
there's no such thing. - I wish.
but they're twice as strong as demons... and bigger dicks.
why would an angel want to kill us?
it's a long story, and we'll tell you the whole thing,
but right now, you've got to trust us, and we got to go.
look at my face and tell me if I'm lying to you.
okay.
where do we go? - Out of here. We got to move now, though.
okay. But what do I tell john?
just tell him
??
Mr. Woodson?
you still here?
I wish I could say it's good to see you, Anna.
you too, Dean.
I'm sorry.
sorry.
it's not that easy to kill an angel.
no. But you can distract them.
monsters.
monsters? - Yes.
monsters are real.
I'm sorry, I didn't know how -- - And you fight them? All of you?
Yeah.
how long?
all my life.
John, just try to understand -- - She didn't exactly have a choice
shut up, all of you!
look, not another word, or so help me, I will turn this car around!
Wow. Awkward family road trip.
no kidding.
place has been in the family for years.
devil's trap.
pure iron fixtures, of course.
um, there should be salt and holy water in the pantry,
knives, guns.
all that stuff will do is piss it off.
so, what will kill it? Or slow it down, at least?
not much.
great.
he said not much, not nothing.
we packed.
if we put this up...
and she comes close,
we beam her right off the starship.
this is holy oil.
it's kind of like a -- Like a devil's trap for angels.
come on. I'll show you how it works.
Hey, what's the deal with the thing on the paper?
it's a sigil. That means
I don't care what it means.
where does it go?
on a wall or a door.
how big should I make it?
John... - What?
you all might have treated me like a fool, but I am not useless.
I can draw a damn...
whatever it is -- A sigil.
why don't you go help Sam out?
okay, Because this has got to be done in...
it's got to be done in human blood.
so, how big?
I'll show you.
what?
all of a sudden, you -- You really remind me of my dad.
that's really good.
you come to check on me?
uh...
I wanted to say I-I'm sorry about all this.
I-I know it's a lot.
look, how long have you known about this...
hunting stuff?
pretty much forever.
my dad raised me in it.
you're serious?
who the hell does that to a kid?
well, I mean, for the record, Mary's parents did.
I don't care.
you know, what kind of irresponsible bastard lets a child anywhere near
y-you know, you could've been killed!
I, uh... came kind of close.
the number it must've done on your head...
your father was supposed to protect you.
he was trying.
he died trying.
believe me...
I used to be mad at him. I-I mean, I used to...
I used to hate the guy. But now I-I...
I get it. He was...
just doing the best he could.
and he was trying to keep it together in --in
in this impossible situation.
see...
my mom, um...
she was amazing, beautiful,
and... she was the love of his life.
and she got killed.
and...
I think he would have gone crazy if he didn't do something.
truth is, um...
my dad died
before I got to tell him that...
...I understand...
...why he did what he did.
and I forgive him for what it did to us.
I do.
and I just
I love him.
you look well. - You shouldn't have called.
we're under strict orders not to come down here,
much less take a vessel.
you're not the Anna of now.
no, but 30 years from now, I'm still your superior.
I need you to kill some humans.
always happy to do some smiting.
but what's going on?
in the future, these people are going to kill you, Uriel.
I'm giving you the chance to kill them first.
thank you.
okay.
you said you'd explain everything when we had a minute.
we have a minute.
why does an angel want me dead?
bcause they're dicks.
not good enough.
I didn't even know they existed, and now i'm a target?
it's complicated.
fine.
all ears.
you're just gonna have to trust me, okay?
I've been trusting you all day.
it's kind of hard to believe.
all right, then. I'm walking out the door.
I'm your son.
what?
I'm your son.
sorry. I don't know how else to say it.
we're from the year 2010.
an angel zapped us back here...
not the one that attacked you -- Friendlier.
you can't expect me to believe that.
our names are Dean and Sam Winchester.
we're named after your parents.
when I would get sick,
you would make me tomato-rice soup,
because that's what your mom made you.
and instead of a lullaby...
you would sing "hey jude..."
...Bcause that's your favorite beatles song.
I...
I don't believe it.
no.
I'm sorry, but it's true.
I raised my kids to be hunters?
no. No, you didn't.
how could I do that to you?
you didn't do it...
...because you're dead.
what? What happened?
YELLOW-EYED demon.
he killed you, and...
...John became a hunter to get revenge.
he raised us in this life.
listen to me.
a demon comes into sam's nursery
exactly six months after he's born -- November 2, 1983.
remember that date. And whatever you do...
do not go in there.
you wake up that morning and you take Sam and you run.
that's not good enough, Dean.
wherever she goes, the demon's gonna find her...
find me.
well, then what?
she can leave Dad. That's what.
you got to leave John.
what? - When this is all over, walk away...
and never look back.
so we're never born.
he's right.
I-I can't.
you're saying that you're my children,
and now you're saying
you have no other choice.
there's a big difference between dying and never being born. And trust me, we're okay with it, i promise you that.
okay, well, i'm not.
listen, you think you can have that normal life that you want so bad...
but you can't. I'm sorry.
it's all gonna go rotten.
you are gonna die,
and your children will be cursed.
there -- There has to be a way.
no, this is the way.
leave John. - I can't.
this is bigger than us.
there are so many more lives at stake
you don't understand. I can't.
it's too late.
I'm...
I'm pregnant.
Hey, we got a problem.
those blood things, the sigils -- They're gone.
gone as in... - I drew one on the back of the door. I turned around.
and when I looked back again, it was a smudge.
he's right.
there's no more holy oil.
who the hell are you?
I'm Uriel.
Oh, come on. Go.
here goes nothing.
I'm really sorry.
...I didn't know.
goodbye, Uriel.
what did you do to John?
John is fine.
who - What are you?
Shh...
well, I'd say this conversation is long overdue, - Wouldn't you? - Fix him.
first...
we talk.
then I fix your darling little sammy.
how'd you get in my dad, anyway?
I told him I could save his wife, and he said yes.
I guess they oversold me
being your one and only vessel.
you're my true vessel but not my only one.
what is that supposed to mean?
it's a bloodline.
a bloodline?
stretching back to Cain and Abel.
it's in your blood, your father's blood,
your family's blood.
awesome.
six degrees of heaven bacon.
what do you want with me?
you really don't know the answer to that?
well, you know I ain't gonna say yes, so why are you here?
what do you want with me?!
I just want you to understand what you and I have to do.
Oh, I get it.
you got beef with your brother.
well, get some therapy, pal. Don't take it out on my planet!
you're wrong.
Lucifer defied our father, and he betrayed me.
but still...
I don't want this any more than you would want to kill Sam.
you know, my brother - I practically raised him.
I took care of him
in a way most people could never understand,
and I still love him.
but I am going to kill him
because it is right and I have to.
Oh, because god says so? - Yes.
from the beginning,
he knew this was how it was going to end.
and you're just gonna do whatever god says.
Yes, because I am a good son.
okay, well, trust me, pal. Take it from someone who knows
that is a dead-end street.
and you think you know better than my father?
one unimportant little man
what makes you think you get to choose?
because I got to believe that I can choose what I do
with my...unimportant little life.
you're wrong.
you know how I know?
think of a million random acts of chance
that let John and Mary be born,
to meet, to fall in love, to have the two of you.
think of the million random choices that you make
and yet how each and every one of them
brings you closer to your destiny.
do you know why that is?
because it's not random. It's not chance.
it's a plan that is playing itself out perfectly.
free will's an illusion, Dean.
that's why you're going to say yes.
Oh, buck up.
it could be worse.
you know, unlike my brothers,
I won't leave you a drooling mess when i'm done wearing you.
well, what about my dad?
better than new.
in fact, i'm gonna do your mom and your dad a favor.
what? - Scrub their minds.
they won't remember me or you.
you can't do that.
I'm just giving your mother what she wants.
she can go back to her husband, her family
she's gonna walk right into that nursery!
obviously.
and you always knew that was going to play out
one way or another.
you can't fight city hall.
he's home...
safe and sound.

one ex-blood junkie,
one dropout with 6 bucks to his name,
and Mr. Comatose over there.
it's awesome. - It's not funny.
I'm not laughing.
they all say we'll say yes.
I know. It's getting annoying.
what if they're right?
they're not.
I mean, Why - Why would we, either of us?
but...I've been weak before.
michael got dad to say yes.
that was different.
Anna was about to kill mom.
and if you could save mom...
what would you say?
Where'd you even get it?
garage sale. 25 cents.
well, I'm glad to hear that, anyway.
Hey.
I mean, you really don't think it's just a little cheesy?
Mnh-mnh. I think it's sweet.
I can't even put my finger on why i like it.
I just...like it.
well, then, I love it.
Ohh...
quite a kick there.
troublemaker already.
it's okay, baby. It's all okay.
angels are watching over you.
then and these specific omens - they're prelude to what?
the four horsemen.
and which one rides the red horse?
war. you can't kill war, kiddos.
Oh, we know.
the ring. the ring.
you can't stop thinking about it
ever since you saw it dripping off the blade of that knife.
blood, blood, blood.
I'm not some junkie!
I think that the "dean and sam" story sucks!
it is not fun.
it's not entertaining.
it is a river of crap
that would send most people howling to the nuthouse!
how many people do you have to save? - All of 'em.
how do you get up in the morning?
that's a good question.
I'm just tired, man.
and I'm done.
I am just done.
now
first date.
I had a really good time tonight, russell.
can I see you again? Sunday, maybe?
I just don't want to be alone On valentine's day...
again.
I know what you mean.
I'm sorry. I just -- I
I don't want you to think I'm the type of person who
no, I should apologize
Oh, god.
I respect the crap out of you right now.
shut up!
your neck! I think I bit you.
it's okay. It's good.
I've been so alone.
so empty...
I know. Me too.
I want you, russell -- All of you...
inside me... - Yes.
there was blood everywhere...
and... Other stuff...
I think alice was already dead.
but russell wasn't?
I think he was, mostly, Except...
he was still sort of...
chewing a little.
how do two people even do that
eat each other to death?
that's a really good question.
now, the last few days, Did you notice her acting erratically?
how do you mean? - I mean, did she seem...
unusually hostile, aggressive?
no way.
Alice never drank, never even swore.
she was a nice girl.
and I'm talking, like, a nice girl
like she still had her promise ring, If you know what I mean.
she was a virgin? - No premarital.
I used to wonder how she did it.
I mean, you know, didn't do it.
it was her first date in months.
she was so excited.
apparently, they were both pretty excited.
how'd it go?
um... No emf, no sulfur.
ghost possession and demonic possession Are both probably out.
hmm. That's where I was puttin' my money.
Nope.
well, then what, then? Oh, dude!
at the coroner's - you didn't see these bodies.
I mean, these two started eating A-and they just...
kept going.
I mean, their stomachs were full.
like -- like... Thanksgiving-dinner full.
talk about co-dependent.
well...
I mean, we got our feelers out.
all right. I'm just gonna go through some files.
you can go ahead and get going.
sorry? Go ahead. Unleash the kraken.
see you tomorrow morning.
where am I going? - Dean, it's valentine's day.
your favorite holiday, remember? I mean, what do you always call it
uh, unattached drifter christmas?
Oh, yeah. Well...
be that as it may... I don't know.
guess I'm not feeling it this year.
so you're not into bars full of lonely women?
Nah, I guess not.
what? - It's when a dog doesn't eat
that's when you know something's really wrong.
remarkably patronizing concern duly noted. Nothing's wrong.
we gonna work or what?
Ouch! No me gusta.
have you been proofing this thing, jimbo?
sorry?
tell me you are not checking your cellphone again!
man, she's got you on a leash.
I'm not on a leash, brad.
she just wants to know where I am.
she just wants to know that you're whipped.
it's not like that. - Oh, yeah. It's like...
Brad, just give me two minutes.
no, man. No. I'm the project leader on this thing,
and I'm not gonna half-ass it Just 'cause my wingman has gone mental
over some chick he met, like, a week ago.
holy crap.
where were you?
I know. It's just I had to
you can't choose work over me, jim!
I won't, janice. I'm sorry
Jimbo, due respect, but honestly, bro
what are we gonna do, jimmy? - I don't know, baby.
seems like whatever we do,
something in life is always gonna keep us apart
work, family, sleep.
now prison, maybe...
maybe.
but I think I have an idea...
how we can stay together...
forever...
you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
agent marley, you just can't stay away.
heard you tagged another double suicide.
well, I just finished closing them up.
Dr. Corman, this is my partner, special agent cliff.
agent cliff. I've finished my prelims.
I pulled the organ sets and sent off the tox samples.
great. You mind if we take a look at the bodies?
not at all. But like I said -- Their...
Good-an d-plenties are already tupperwared.
super.
leave the keys with marty up front.
and please, gentlemen...
refrigerate after opening...
be my valentine?
wait a second.
these hearts both have identical marks.
check this out.
it looks like some kind of letter.
Oh, no.
what?
I think it's enochian.
you mean like angel scratches?
so you think it's like the tagging on our ribs?
Dean, I don't know.
Ah, hell.
Cass, it's dean.
Yeah, room 31-c, basement level...
St. James medical center.
I'm there now.
Yeah, I get that.
I'm gonna hang up now.
right.
you're right, sam. These are angelic marks.
I imagine you'll find similar marks On the other couples' hearts as well
so, what are they? I mean, what do they mean?
it's a mark of union.
this man and woman were intended to mate.
okay, but who put them there?
well, your people call them "cupid.
a what?
what human myth has mistaken for "cupid
is actually a lower order of angel.
technically it's a cherub, third-class. - Cherub?
Yeah, they're all over the world. There are dozens of them.
you mean the little flying fat kid in diapers?
they're not incontinent.
okay, anyways. So, what you're saying
what I'm saying is a cupid has gone rogue.
and we have to stop him - before he kills again.
naturally.
of course we do.
so, what, you just happen to know He likes the cosmos at this place?
this place is a nexus of human reproduction.
it's exactly the kind of
... Of garden the cupid will come to
to pollinate.
wait a minute. You're not hungry?
no.
what? I'm not hungry.
then you're not gonna finish that?
he's here.
where? I don't see anything.
there.
you mean the same-sid e-of-the-booth couple over there?
meet me in the back.
Cass, where is he?
I have him tethered.
manifest yourself.
so, where is he?
here I am!
help! - Oh, help is on the way.
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
Hello, you!
this is cupid? - yes.
and look at you, huh?
no. - Yes! Yes, yes, yes!
is this a fight? Are we in a fight?
this is... Their handshake.
I don't like it. - No one likes it.
what can I do for you?
why are you doing this? - Doing what?
your targets -- the ones you've marked
they're slaughtering each other.
what? They are?
listen, birthday suit, We know, okay?
we know you been flittin' around,
popping people with your poison arrow,
making them murder each other!
what we don't know is why.
you think that I
well, uh...
I don't know what to say.
should... Should somebody maybe...
go talk to him? - Yeah, that's a good idea. Give 'em hell, cass.
um... Look.
we didn't mean to, um...
... Hurt your feelings.
love is more than a word to me, you know.
I love love. I love it!
and if that's wrong, I don't want to be rht!
Yes, yes. Of course. I, uh...
I have no idea what you're saying.
I s just on my appointed rous.
whatever my taets do ter that That's nothing to do withe.
I-I was followinmy orders.
mind. Y nd ll see.
he's telling the jiny chrisas. Thank you.
it, wait, you id
you said you were just following orders?
whose orders?
heaven, silly. Heaven.
why does heaven care if harry meets sally?
you know, certain bloodlines, certain destinies.
Oh, like yours. - What?
Yeah, the union ofand mary winchester
very big detairs, top priority arrangement. Mm.
aryou saying that you fixed-up our parents?
well, not me, but... Yeah.
well, it wasn't easy, either.
Ooh, they couldn't stand each other at first.
but when we were done with them
perfect couple. - Perfect?
Yeah. - They're dead!
I'm sorry, but...
the orders were very clear.
you and sam needed to be born.
your parents were just, uh...
meant to be.
a match made in heaven heaven!
son of a bitch!
where is he? Where'd he go? !
I believe you upset him.
upset him? !
Dean. Enough!
what?
you just punched a cupid!
I punched a dick!
are we gonna talk about What's been up with you lately or not?
or not.
you said you wanted to hear about Any other weird ones.
okay.
pulled his records.
looks like this gentleman used to weigh 400 pounds or so,
till he got a gastric bypass,
which brought down his weight considerably.
but then for some reason, last night,
he decided to go on a twinkie binge.
so, he died from a twinkie binge?
well, after he blew out the band around his stomach,
he filled it up till it burst.
when he could no longer swallow,
he started jamming the cakes down his gullet With a...
with a toilet brush, Like he was ramrodding a cannon.
so, what do you make of it?
I'd say that it was A very peculiar thing to do...
Hey. So, uh, this guy was not marked by cupid,
but his death is definitely suspicious.
Yeah, well, I just went through the police blotter,
and counting him, That's eight suicides since Wednesday And 19 o. D. S
that's way out of the seasonal batting average.
Yeah, if there's a pattern here, it ain't just love.
it's a hell of a lot bigger than we thought.
Yeah, all right. I'll see you in 10.
Yeah, okay.
I ow what you are, damn it.
I could smell you.
what the hell does a demon got to do with this, anyway?
believe me, I got no idea.
you okay?
Yeah, yeah. I'll be all right.
let's crack her open.
what's the worst that could happen, right?
what the hell was that?
it's a human soul.
it's starting to make sense.
now, what about that makes sense?
and when did you start eating?
exactly. My hunger -- it's a clue, actually.
for what?
this town is not suffering From some love-gone-wrong effect.
it's suffering from hunger.
starvation, to be exact -- Specifically...
famine. - Famine?
a-as in the horseman?
great. T-t-that's freaking great.
I thought famine meant starvation, Like as in, you know, food.
Yes. Absolutely. But not just food.
I mean, everyone seems to be starving for something
sex, attention, drugs, love...
well, that explains The puppy-lovers that cupid shot up.
right. The cherub made them crave love,
and then famine came, and made them rabid for it.
okay, but what about you?
I mean, since when do angels Secretly hunger for white castle?
it's my vessel -- jimmy.
his, uh, appetite for red meat Has been touched by famine's effect.
so, famine just rolls into town And everybody goes crazy?
and then will come famine riding on a black steed.
he will ride into the land of plenty...
he must devour the souls of his victims.
so, that's what was in the briefcase
the twinkie dude's soul?
Lucifer has sent his demons to care for famine,
to feed him, make certain he'll be ready.
ready for what?
to March across the land.
hungry.
the vessel -- He's here.
where?
at the hospital.
we fought, but he got away.
I...
I got this off him.
good. Yes. After lunch.
now, where is it?
sorry?
the one who loves cream cake so much.
where is his soul?
I am sorry. No. The
Winchester took the case from me.
uh, he had the knife. I
I lost it.
but I'm hungry!
I'll get another.
I-I won't be 10 minutes.
hungry! Now!
delicious!
famine?
Yes.
we should stop it.
Yeah, that's a great idea. How?
how did you stop the last horseman you met?
war got his mojo from this ring.
and after we cut it off, he just tucked tail and ran.
and everybody that was affected,
it was like they woke up out of a dream.
you think famine's got a class ring, too?
I know he does.
well, okay. L-let's track him down and get to chopping.
Yeah.
what are you, the hamburglar?
I've developed a taste for ground beef.
well, have you even tried to stop it?
I'm an angel. I can stop anytime I want. Whatever.
Sam, let's roll.
I, um...
I can't.
I can't go.
what do you mean?
I think it got to me, dean.
I think I'm hungry for it...
hungry for what?
you know.
demon blood?
you got to be kidding me.
you got to get him out of here. You got to beam him to, like, montana.
anywhere but here. - It won't work. He's already infected.
the hunger is just gonna travel with him.
well, then, what do we do?
you go cut that bastard's finger off.
you heard him.
but, dean...
before you go, you better...
... You better lock me down.
but good.
all right, well, just hang in there. We'll be back as soon as we can.
be careful. And... Hurry.
is dr. Corman around?
you haven't heard?
heard what?
guy's been dry for the last 20 years,
but this morning, he left work, went home,
and drank himself to death.
it's famine.
pardon? - Would you give us a minute, please?
sure. - Thanks.
crap!
I really kind of liked this guy.
they haven't harvested his soul yet.
well, if we want to play "follow the soul" To get to famine,
our best shot starts with the doc, here.
are you serious?
these make me...
...very happy.
how many is that?
I lost count. It's in the low hundreds.
what I don't understand is...
where is your hunger, dean?
but so far, you seem unaffected.
Hey, when I want to drink, I drink.
when I want sex, I go get it.
same goes for a sandwich or a fight.
so... You're saying you're just well-adjusted?
God, no. I'm just well-fed.
there.
guys?
guys, what happened?
I don't think it worked. I think I'm still
... Still hungry.
look at this.
someone trussed you up for us.
boss says we can't kill you...
... But I bet we can break off a few pieces.
get him off! Get him off!
wait your turn.
demons.
you want to go over the plan again?
Hey, happy meal. The plan?
I take the knife, I go in, I cut off the ring hand of famine,
and I meet you back here in the parking lot.
well, that sounds foolproof.
this is taking too long.
the other mr. Winchester.
what did you do to him?
you sicced your dog on me.
I just threw him a steak.
so this is your big trick? Huh?
making people cuckoo for cocoa puffs?
doesn't take much -- hardly a push.
Oh, america -- all-you-can-eat, all the time.
consume, consume.
a swarm of locusts in stretch pants.
and yet, you're all still starving
because hunger doesn't just come from the body,
it also comes from the soul.
it's funny, it doesn't seem to be coming from mine.
Yes.
I noticed that.
have you wondered why that is?
how you could even walk in my presence?
well, I like to think It's because of my strength of character.
I disagree.
Yes. I see.
that's one deep, dark nothing you got there, dean.
can't fill it, can you?
not with food or drink.
not even with sex.
Oh, you're so full of crap.
Oh, you can smirk and joke and lie to your brother,
lie to yourself, but not to me!
I can see inside you, dean.
I can see how broken you are, How defeated.
you can't win, and you know it.
but you just keep fighting.
just...
keep going through the motions.
you're not hungry, dean, because inside, You're already... Dead.
let him go.
Sammy, no! - Stop!
no one lays a finger on this sweet little boy.
Sam, I see you got the snack I sent you.
you sent?
don't worry. You're not like everyone else.
you'll never die from drinking too much.
you're the exception that proves the rule.
just the way...
Satan wanted you to be.
so...
...Cut their throats.
have at them!
Sammy, no!
please, be my guest.
all YOU CAN EAT
no.
well... Fine.
if you don't want them...
then I'll have them.
I'm a horseman, sam.
your power doesn't work on me.
you're right. But it will work on them.
No!
guys, help!
that's not him in there.
not really.
I know.
Dean, sam just has to get it out of his system.
then he'll be -- - Listen, I just, uh...
I just need to get some air.
please...
I can't...
I need some help.
please?
then.
Sam starring as Lucifer. Dean starring as Michael.
you're gonna suck it up, accept your responsibilities,
and play the roles that destiny has chosen for you.
why didn't the stake kill you?
I am the trickster. - But maybe you're not.
Hello, Gabriel. - The archangel?
this isn't about some prizefight between your brothers.
this is about you Being too afraid to stand up to your family!
are you gonna do something stupid?
like what? - Michael stupid.
come on, Sam.
things are about to get really bad.
the people that I'm gonna see next,
they're not gonna get anything from me Without agreeing to a few conditions.
whatever you're thinking of doing, don't do it.
I have to.
you're finally ready, right?
you know there's no other choice. There's never been a choice.
the answer is yes.
of course, I have a few conditions.
what changed your mind? - The damnedest thing.
I mean, the world's ending, The walls are coming down on us.
I just didn't want to let you down.
so screw destiny.
I say we take the fight to them, do it our way.
now.

Hello?
Hello?

have you seen them?
Mr. and Mrs. Logan -- The honeymooners?
they checked out.
is something the matter?
they checked out? - Mm-Hmm. Mm, just now.
Really?
it sort of seemed like they were, um...
...in the middle of something.
Yeah, it's kind of weird for honeymooners to, uh, check out without this.
Oh, dear.
I'll just put that right in the lost and found.
don't you worry.
is there anything else I can help you with?
uh, no. No, we're good.
Super-Fantastic.

sorry to interrupt.
the last guest just arrived.
so everything's ready? - As it will ever be.
Pantry's full.

thank you, Mercury.
okay. Let's get this show on the road.
an elephant? - Yeah.

so what the hell is...

so, what? The roaches check in, they don't check out?
think about how we got here.
that detour on ?
the friggin' hurricane?
you saying we were led here?
like rats in a maze.
please be tomato soup. Please be tomato soup.
motel hell.
help us! Get us out!
hurry up! - I'm going as fast as I can.
there's somebody behind me, isn't there?
??
???
??
???
something tells me this isn't a shriner convention.
dinner is served.
ladies and gentlemen...
our guests of honor have arrived.
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming.
well, in all my centuries, I never thought I'd see this
this many gods under one roof.
gods?
now, before we get down to brass tacks, some ground rules
no slaughtering each other.
curb your wrath.
Oh, and, uh, keep your hands off the local virgins.
we're trying to keep a low profile here.
Oh, we are so, so screwed.
now, we all know why we're here.
the judeo-Christian apocalypse looms over us.
I know we've all had our little disagreements In the past,
but the time has come to put those aside and look toward the future.
because if we don't, we won't have one.
now, we do have two very valuable bargaining chips
michael and Lucifer's vessels.
the question is...
what do we do now?
anybody have any bright ideas, speak up.
this is a safe room.
??
??? - Oh, I don't like his tone.
kill them? Why?
so the angels here can bring them back again?
I don't know what everybody's getting so worked up about.
this is just a couple of angels having a slap fight.
it's no armageddon.
everybody knows when the world comes to an end,
the great Serpent Jormungandr rises up,
and I, myself, will be eaten by a big wolf.
??
Oh, yeah? And why is that?
because your beliefs are so much more realistic?
the whole world's getting carried around on the back of a giant turtle.
give me a break.
??? - What are you gonna do about it?
??
you watch your mouth when you talk to me, boy!
??? - No one's ever proved that.
stay.
we have to fight.
the archangels -- The only thing they understand is violence.
this ends in blood. There is no other way.
it's them...or us.
with all due respect... madam...
we haven't even tried talking to them.
Kali.
who asked you?
can't we all just get along?
it's always wrong place, worst time with you muttonheads, huh?
Loki.
Baldur.
good seeing you, too.
I guess my invitation got lost in the mail.
why are you here?
to talk about the elephant in the room.
not you.
the apocalypse.
we can't stop it, gang.
but first things first.
the adults need to have a little conversation.
check you later.
okay.
did that...Holy crap.
Yeah, tell me about it.
by the way, next time I say "let's keep driving,"
uh, let's keep driving. - Okay, yeah, next time.
uh, all right, so, what's our next move?
I-I
I don't know.
we grab those poor saps out of the freezer, I guess
bust them out.
gank a few freaks along the way if we're lucky.
and when are you ever lucky?
Oh, you know what? Bite me, Gabriel.
maybe later, big boy.
I should have known.
I mean, this had your stink all over it from the jump.
you think I'm behind this?
please.
I'm the costner to your houston.
I'm here to save your ass.
you want to pull us out of the fire? - Bingo.
those gods are either gonna dust you or use you as bait.
either way, you're uber-boned.
wow -- 'Cause a couple of months ago,
you were telling us that we need to play our roles.
you were uber-boning us.
Ohhhhh, the end is still nigh.
michael and Lucifer are gonna dance the lambada.
but not tonight. Not here.
and why do you care?
I don't care.
but...
me and kali, we, uh...
had a thing.
chick was all hands.
what can I say? I'm sentimental.
do they have a chance?
against satan? - Really, Sam?
you got a better idea, Dean?
it's a bad idea.
Lucifer's gonna turn them into finger paint.
so let's get going while the going's good.
okay, great. Why don't you just zap us out of here, then?
would if I could.
but Kali's got you by the short and curlies.
it's a blood spell.
you boys are on a leash. - What does that mean?
means it's time for a little of the old black magic.
okay. Yeah. Well, whatever.
we're gonna take the hors d'oeuvres in the freezer with us.
forget it.
it's gonna be hard enough sneaking you mooks out of here.
they called you "Loki," right?
which mean they don't really know who you are.
told you -- I'm in witness protection.
okay, well, then how about you do what we say,
or we tell the, uh, legion of doom about your secret identity?
they don't seem like a real pro-angel kind of crowd.
I'll take your voices away.
we'll write it down. - I'll cut off your hands.
then people are gonna be asking, "Why are you guys running around with no hands?"
fine.
leave.
you always did play hard to get.
I've moved on. - I noticed.
Baldur? Really?
baldur's uncomplicated.
No!
no, no! No! No! Stop!
No!
it's too late.
I never took you for the type.
romantic? - Pathetic.
you're the one who called me here.
because I thought you might take this seriously.
I'm taking this seriously.
ship's sinking. Time to get off.
I mean, screw this marble. Let's go check out Pandora.
it doesn't have to be like that.
afraid it does.
if we fight... - You die.
and what makes you such an expert?
I've tussled with those winged Ass-Monkeys once or twice.
Kali... No more tricks.
I'm begging you -- Don't do this.
I have to.
can't blame me for trying.
still love me?
no.
where the hell is Gabriel?
you must take me for a fool...
you're bound to me
now and forever.
Ghostfacers! - Ghostfacers!
ghostfacers . we face the ghosts when the others will not we're the ghost, ghostfacers they leave the kitchen when the kitchen gets hot.
is the intern position open?
you're hired!
Really?
see my face - Right in your little box? - Yeah. yeah.
okay, my face has got to be right in your box.
OK. Ghostfacers. we face the faces . we face the ghosts,ghostfacers
if you're dead, you better stay dead.
Yep. - Because if not, we're gonna kill you.
how long have you known?
long enough.
how's the rescue going?
well, surprise, surprise.
the trickster has tricked us.
Kali...Don't.
you're mine now.
and you have something I want.
an archangel's blade.
from the archangel... Gabriel.
okay! okay!
so I got wings. Like Kotex.
but that doesn't make me any less right about Lucifer.
he's lying.
he's a spy.
I'm not a spy. I'm a runaway.
I'm trying to save you.
I know my brother, Kali.
he should scare the living crap out of you.
you can't beat him.
I've skipped ahead -- Seen how this story ends.
your story -- Not ours.
westerners -- I swear, the sheer arrogance.
you think you're the only ones on earth?
you pillage and you butcher in your god's name.
but you're not the only religion.
and he's not the only god.
and now you think you can just rip the planet apart?
you're wrong.
there are billions of us.
and we were here first.
if anyone gets to end this world...
...It's me.
I'm sorry.
this is crazy.
they can die.
we can kill Lucifer.
all right, you primitive screwheads. Listen up.
are you out of your mind?
I'm out of options.
now, on any other given day, I'd be doing my damnedest to, uh, kill you,
you filthy, murdering chimps.
but, uh, hey...
desperate times.
so even though I'd love nothing better Than to slit your throats, you...
dicks...
...I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna help you ice the devil.
and then we can all get back to ganking each other, like normal.
you want Lucifer?
well, dude's not in the yellow pages.
but me and Sam, we can get him here.
how?
first, you let those main courses go.
then we talk.
we can either take on the devil together
or you lame-ass bitches can eat me.
literally.
come on, everybody! Let's go!
let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
all right. All right. Go! Go! Go!
get out of here!
don't look at me!
act natural.
get in.
man, there is nothing natural about this at all.
I thought you were dead.
you think I'd give kali my real sword?
that thing can kill me.
then what do they have in there?
a fake.
made it out of a can of diet orange slice.
so, uh...
go snag our blood, would ya?
what? - I heard you in there.
Kali likes you. You can get close.
lift the plasma, then we vamoose.
no.
hand over the real blade.
better yet, why don't you sack up and help us take down Lucifer?
you can't be serious. - Deadly.
since when are you butt-buddies with a bunch of monsters?
that's all they are to you, aren't they?
all right, you know what? Sam was right. It's nuts.
but it's the best idea I've heard. So unless you have a better one...
well, good luck with that.
me, I'm blowing jonestown.
those lemmings want to run off a cliff, That's their business.
I see right through you. You know that?
the smart-ass shell, the whole "I could give a crap" thing.
believe me, it takes one to know one.
that so? - Yes.
and maybe those freaks in there aren't your blood,
but they are your family.
they just stabbed me in the friggin' heart!
maybe, but you still give a crap about them, don't you?
Dean -- - Now, they're gonna die in there without you.
I can't kill my brother.
"Can't"or "won't"?
that's what I thought.
so, you're going to summon Lucifer?
sort of.
I just need you to squeegee some stuff from my ribs,
and he'll come running.
breaking them would be easier.
show's over.
sword's a fake.
and Gabriel --He's still kicking.
I hate to break it to you, sister, but you've been tricked.
checking in.
Lucifer. Thanks for coming.
Oh, you did right calling me.
it's just...
the way the talk is heading in there, it's...
it's insane.
you know, I never understood you pagans.
you're such... petty little things.
always fighting...
always happy to sell out your own kind.
no wonder you forfeited this planet to us.
you are worse than humans.
you're worse than demons.
and yet you claim to be gods.
and they call me prideful.
what's happening?
it's him.
how? - Does it matter?
shazam us out of here, would you?
we can't.
of course you can't.
you didn't say "mother, may I?"
Sam, Dean. Good to see you again.
Baldur...don't.
you think you own the planet?
what gives you the right?!
no one gives us the right.
we take it.
are you okay?
not really.
better late than never, huh?
guard this with your life.
I'm home.
not this time.
guys!
get her out of here.
over a girl.
Gabriel, really?
I hope you didn't catch anything.
you're my brother, and I love you.
but you are a great big bag of dicks.
what did you just say to me?
look at yourself.
boo-hoo.
daddy was mean to me, so I'm gonna smash up all his toys.
watch your tone.
play the victim all you want.
but you and me
we know the truth.
dad loved you best.
more than Michael.
more than me.
then he brought the new baby home, and you couldn't handle it.
so all this is just a great big temper tantrum.
time to grow up.
I'm not getting in that thing.
just get in the car, princess.
Gabriel, if you're doing this for Michael
screw him.
if he were standing here, I'd shiv his ass, too.
you disloyal
Oh, I'm loyal.
to them.
who?
these...
so-called gods?
to people, Lucifer. People.
so you're willing to die for a pile of cockroaches? Why?
because dad was right.
they are better than us. - They are broken, flawed abortions.
damn right they're flawed.
but a lot of them try...
to do better.
to forgive.
and you should see the spearmint rhino.
I've been riding the pine a long time,
but I'm in the game now.
and I'm not on your side or Michael's.
I'm on theirs.
brother, don't make me do this.
no one makes us do anything.
I know you think you're doing the right thing, Gabriel.
but I know where your heart truly lies.
here.
amateur hocus-Pocus.
don't forget
you learned all your tricks from me, little brother.
all preformamer in this film are over the age of 18,have consiented to being photographed.
and have provide proof of age18 U.S.C.section2257.
casa erotica.
dear diary...
being a high-Powered business president is super-fun
but so exhausting
sometimes I just need to relax.
I need...
casa erotica.
room service.
come in!
Gabriel wanted you to guard this with your life?
maybe he's a fan.
it is a good one.
I've got the kielbasa you ordered.
Mmm. Polish?
Hungarian.
what the hell's going on?
you're probably wondering what the hell's going on.
well...
if you're watching this...
I'm dead.
Oh, please!
stop sobbing.
it's embarrassing for all of us.
without me, you've got zero shot at killing Lucifer.
sorry.
but...
you can trap him.
the cage you sprung lucifer from is still down there.
and maybe -- Just maybe -- You can shove his ass back in.
not that it'll be easy.
you got to get the cage open, trick my bro back into it,
and, uh -- Oh, yeah
avoid Michael and the god squad.
but hey, details, right?
and here's the big secret
Lucifer himself doesn't even know.
but the key to the cage
it's out there.
actually, it's keys -- Plural.
four keys.
well, four rings.
from the horsemen.
you get them all, you got the cage.
can't say I'm betting on you boys, But, uh, hey, I've been wrong before.
and, Dean...
you were right.
I was afraid to stand up to my brother.
not anymore.
so this is me standing up.
and this is me...
lying down.
Oh! Oh, man.
horsemen, huh?
well, we got war's.
we nicked famine's.
that's two rings down. Collect all four.
just need pestilence and death.
Oh, is that all?
it's a plan.
us daily monitor.
what the hell?
does this stuff make you drowsy?
I got a lot of driving to do.
blue ones make you sleepy.
red and orange ones are okay for daytime.
this is
this is awful.
what would I do without you?
No! Sam!
something turned him into a monster.
what are we dealing with? Do you know?
Croatoan. It's a virus of plague and pestilence.
who knows how far this thing can spread?
it's Crowley, right?
and why exactly would you want the devil dead?
survival.
if Lucifer manages to exterminate humankind,
we're next.
I'm just glad we got something to offer people.
well, I'm sorry. It's a load of crap
pure profit-Driven crap.
well, swine flu -- It's an epidemic.
Yeah, well, if niveus was really worried about the epidemic,
they'd be giving the vaccine out for free.
this supposed new formula?
well, they say it's faster-Acting.
maybe it is, but human trials this week?
Yeah, it does seem a little rushed.
a little rushed?
have you even seen the new vaccine?
no. - Yeah. Neither have I.
I have.
who the hell are you?
I'm running the experiment.
what the hell?!
relax. You're part of it, too.
well, looks like it works.
check it out -- I look like the king of pop.
too soon?
too soon.
don't get me wrong -- I'm glad the cdc is here,
but what we really need is vaccine.
you got that right.
well, tell me,
have you noticed anything unusual about the strain
any signs of behavioral change,
like aggression, maybe?
excuse me?
have the flu victims shown any signs of, uh,
homicidal tendencies?
symptomatically speaking, we're looking at
a relatively mild case of swine flu here.
probably add up to a miserable week off of work, - And that's about it. - So nothing unusual.
day and a half ago, we didn't have a single case.
now we're looking at over 70
the infectious equivalent a briefcase bomb.
so, yeah, I might call that a little unusual.
day and a half?
that's the Same time those statues started crying.
Yep. - I'm sorry.
what was that? - What was what?
did you just say a bunch of statues started crying?
what? Why, no. No. W-Who would
who would say that, huh? Crazy people.
exactly. - Yeah, which we are not.
no.
just... get us some vaccine.
let me guess -- Another steamin'-Hot pile of swine flu.
Yep.
doesn't make any sense, Bobby.
pestilence touched down here. I'm sure of it.
but why is he dealing them soft ser like swine flu
when he's got the croatoan virus up his sleeve?
I-I-I don't get it.
doesn't matter what the sick son of a bitch is doing.
what matters is this is the fourth town he's hit That we know of
and we're still eating his dust.
did you get anything?
we got even a snowball at probable next target?
uh, no pattern we can see.
okay.
hold on.
well, far as I can tell, he's still heading east,
so... head east, I guess.
East? East?
Bobby, we're in west nevada.
east is practically all there is.
Yeah, well, you better get to drivin
say...
I've got an idea.
did you get him? - He's gone.
fancy a fag and a chat?
you're upset. We should discuss it.
not here, but
you want to talk? Afte what you did to us?
after what I -- What I did to you?!
I gave you the colt!
Yeah, and you knew it wouldn't work against the devil!
I never! - You set us up.
we lost people on that suicide run
good people!
who you take on the ride is your own business!
look, everything is still the Same.
w-we're all still in this together.
sure we are.
call your dog off -- Please.
give me one good reason.
I can give you pestilence.
what do you know about pestilence?
I know how to get him.
that's got your interest, doesn't it - Are you actually listening to this? - Sam
are you friggin' nuts?! - Shut up for a second, Sam!
shut up, the both of you!
look...I swear...
I thought the colt would work. It's an honest mistake.
it's all part of the learning process.
but nothing's changed. I still want the devil dead.
well... one thing's changed.
now the devil knows that I want him dead.
which, by the way, Makes me the most buggered son in all of creation.
holy crap. We don't care.
they burnt down my house!
they ate my tailor!
two months under a rock, like a bloody salamander!
every demon on hell and earth's got his eyes out for me!
and yet... here I am...
last place I should be
in the road, talking to Sam and Dean Winchester,
under a friggin' spotlight!
so come with me. Please.
do you want the horsemen rings or not?
ye I know all about that.
shall we?
here we are
my life on the lam.
how the mighty have fallen.
single-pane glass,
used contraception in the fireplace.
the water damage alone
my heart's bleeding for you.
now, how do you know about the rings?
well, now...
I've been keeping a close eye on you lot.
we ot hex bags. We're hidden from demons.
all but one.
that night you broke into my house,
our first date,
my valet hid a tracking device in your car
a magical coin That easily trumps your little bags o' bones.
it allows me to hear things, too
and, my, the things I've heard.
so you want to cram the devil back in the box?
cunning scheme.
I want in.
you said you could get us pestilence.
well, now...
I don't know where pestilence is...
per se.
but I do know the demon who does.
he's what you might call the horsemen's stable boy.
he handles their itineraries, their personal needs.
he's who you want -- Believe me.
he'll tell us where sneezy's at.
well, how do we get him to spill?
rip out his toenails?
no.
nuts at his pay grade don't crack.
we bring him here, then I sell him.
sell him?
please. I've sold sin to saints for centuries.
think I can't close one little demon?
all right, so where's this demon of yours?
I don't want to hear "weeks.
I want to hear "days.
but the lab isn't even finished testing yet.
you let me worry about the lab.
but, sir, you're asking for distribution On an unprecedented scale.
well, we have an unprecedented outbreak.
the nation... is terrified of swine flu.
they want our vaccine. They need our vaccine.
it's called "demand," people. Now, supply!
we're doing our best.
Oh, you're doing your best?
you're doing your best?
well, then do the best of somebody better!
you wanted to see me?
Mitchell, yes. Come on in.
look, mr. Brad I know how important this is,
and I-I'm sorry if I sounded
no apologies.
Mitch, I need people like you.
Really?
really
in fact, there is a position in communications
that I think you would be perfect for.
sounds great.
is great. So what do you say?
you ready to enter The cutthroat world of upper management?
awesome.
awesome.
watch the shoes, please.
get the rest later. Thanks.
sir, great news.
the vaccine trials -- The results have been...
...really quite grotesque. I think you'll be pleased.
how soon?
distribution on this scale -- I mean, we do need some humans.
we can't possess them all.
and don't even get me started on the teamsters.
I know. I'm doing my best.
Yes, sir.
the best of someone better.
I will. Of course.
why are we even listening to him, Dean?
this is totally insane. - I don't disagree.
one big happy family, are we, then? Fantastic.
you ready to go?
Yes. Yes. I am. Sam, keep the home fires burning.
what are you talking about?
Sam's not coming. - And why the hell not?
because I don't like you...
I don't trust you...
and -- Oh, yes
you keep trying to kill me.
there's no damn way.
this isn't gonna happen!
I'm not asking you, am I? 'Cause you're not invited.
I'm asking you. What's it gonna be?
gentlemen...
enjoy your last few sunsets.
wait.
I'll go.
what can I say? I believe the guy.
and then Dean just walks...
...right out the door with Crowley.
well, look, Sam, I got no love for demons,
and, yeah, this whole thing is crazy, But...
I don't know.
after a year of chasing up zilch,
maybe it's time to go crazy.
Yeah, maybe.
Hey, Bobby?
yeah?
remember that time you were possessed?
Yeah. Rings a bell.
when Meg told you to kill Dean, you didn't.
you took your body back.
just long enough to shank myself, yeah.
well, how'd you do it?
I mean, how'd you take back the wheel?
why are you asking, Sam?
say we can open the cage.
great. But then what?
w-we just lead the devil to the edge And get him to jump in?
you got me.
what if you guys lead the devil to the edge And I jump in?
it'd be just like When you turned the knife around on yourself.
one action -- Just one leap.
are you idiots trying to kill me?! - Bobby
we just got done talking your brother off the ledge,
and now you're lining up to say "yes"?
it's not like that. I'm not gonna do it.
not unless we all agree.
but I think we got to look at our options.
this isn't an option, Sam.
why not? - You can't do it.
what I did was a million-To-One,
and that was some pissant demon I was brain-Wrestling.
you're talking about Taking back control from satan himself.
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
kid...
it's called "possession" for a reason.
you, of all people, ought to know.
I'm strong enough. - You ain't.
he's gonna find every chink in your armor, Sam,
and use it against you
your fear, your grief, your anger.
and let's face it -- You're not exactly mr. Anger management.
how are you gonna control the devil
when you can't control yourself?
demons?
Nah. Human shields.
the demons are up top -- 12th floor.
all right, then. We'll have to find a way in through the back.
you Winchesters make everything so complicated.
Ah, crap.
Oh, crap.
crap!
door's open!
what?
you killed them?
we're on a tight schedule.
come on.
now you're squeamish? Please.
go get 'em, tiger.
wh
you're not coming?
Oh, no. It's not safe up there.
there's demons. - Yeah, I get that.
look, just do what I told you,
a-and try to be convincing.
it'll work like a charm. Trust me.
what, no appointment?
kind of an 11th-Hour thing, you know?
well, then, you're just on time.
have a seat.
how's your brother?
well, down to business, then.
what can I do for you?
actually, it's about what I can do for you.
Really?
me and Sam dropped two of your jockeys. I think you know that.
Yes. I got the memo.
well, we kept their, uh, - secret power rings. - Mm.
which is why I'm here. - mm.
I heard some folks saying that you wanted them back - And you were willing to pay. - Hmm.
where are they? - Not here.
but you want them, you'll come with me
nice and civil
we'll get out of your little batcave here,
and we'll discuss a transaction.
who says I want them?
what?
Who...says... I want them?
you know... Folks.
see...
...war and famine,
even if I could cram the rings back on their bony fingers,
I doubt it would do much good.
they're withered husks right now
fetal position on the floor
all thanks to you.
so I don't want the rings.
what I want is retribution.
and I'm gonna rip it right out of your ass!
this...
...is so good.
therapeutic, for sure. You know, Dean,
I really owe you one, buddy, 'Cause I feel...
so...
much...
better!
Dean! Dean, where are you going?
??? We're just getting started!
good meeting, Dean.
you know, I'm excited.
evening, uncle.
what the hell was that?
that was perfect
perfect?
he didn't want the rings. He wanted me.
imagine the surprise on your face.
what?
your ignorance and misinformation -- I mean, completely authentic.
you can't fake that.
what? I-It went like clockwork.
not for me, you son of a bitch!
Hey, hot stuff, watch the upholstery!
up yours, mate.
this bit of carving will tie our friend here down.
no zapping off, no smoking out
locked in the meat suit...
an important piece of our bargaining strategy.
now, up here, we don't want I-50.
take 93 north.
what are you talking about?
look, we can't take this guy back to your brother.
why the hell not?
they got history, all right?
you want to go anywhere, you start talking.
what history?
Where's Dean?
now...
for the record, I'm against this.
negotiating a high-Level defection
it's very delicate business.
what are you talking about?
I begged Dean not to come back.
we should be miles away... from you.
he replied with a colorful rejoinder
about my "corn chute.
so, go ahead.
go -- Ruin our last best hope.
it's only the end of the world.
what's going on, Dean?
I need you to stay on mission, okay?
focused.
I don't understand. What's all this about?
I'm doing this 'cause I trust you.
trust me to what?
Sam, is that you?
Brady hasn't been Brady in years.
not since, oh... middle of our sophomore year?
what? - That's right.
you had a devil on your shoulder even back then.
all right, now, let it all sink in.
you son of a bitch.
you son of a bitch! You introduced me to Jess!
Ding, ding! I think he's got it!
damn it, Sam! I'm gonna kill you!
Hey! That's enough!
get out of my way! - No.
get out of my way, Dean.
there is only one way to win,
and it ain't by killing that thing in there.
well...
sounds like you got him nice and fluffed.
thanks so much.
listen to me.
we need pestilence to get at the devil,
and we need Brady to get to pestilence.
Why? Because Crowley said so?
because we trust him now?
like I trusted Ruby?
or like I trusted Brady back at school?
look... do the math yourself.
if Lucifer wins,
he'll turn this place into his kingdom.
when the morningstar cleans house,
we all get the mop.
he created us.
why would he destroy us?
that makes no sense.
look at who
at what he is.
then take a look at what we are.
maybe you should be a little less worried
about our necks
and be a little more worried about yours.
has crossed my mind. That's not really the point.
actually, Crowley, that is the point.
no one will know greater torment than you.
Lucifer is never gonna let you die.
as for me, I know the score.
I'm dead, whether I tell you anything or not.
so I think I'll die on the winning side, thanks.
good talk.
Cheers.
well, how'd it go? He buy your girl scout cookies?
not yet.
Where's your moose?
he's cooling off.
all right, then.
get bent.
you going somewhere?
well, he won't budge,
so now I go stick my neck out.
what are you gonna do?
exactly the kind of desperate swashbuckle I've been trying to avoid.
now I go kick open a hive of demons.
this whole bloody ring business better work.
Oh Sam Come on
hey
open the door
open the door
well, here we go.
we doing last words or no?
sophomore year, huh?
Brady, here, he was a good kid
straight arrow. I mean, your best friend, really.
perfect point of access.
Thanksgiving.
Yes, sir.
remember when I came back from break all messed up
dropped out of pre-Med, the drugs, the bitches?
that was the new Brady. That was me.
remember how much time you spent
trying to get me back on the right track?
you really were a good friend.
but ol' yellow eyes didn't send me back to be your friend.
no, we could tell we were starting to lose you.
you were becoming a mild-Mannered, Worthless sack of piss.
now, come on. We couldn't have that.
you were our favorite.
so I hooked you up With a pure, sweet, innocent piece of tail.
and then I toasted her on the ceiling.
that's right -- Azazel might have put the hit out on Jessica,
but, man, I got to have all the fun!
you know, she thought we were friends, too.
let me right in.
she was baking cookies.
she was so surprised...
so hurt when I started in on her.
come on!
do it if it'll make you feel better!
do it, Sammy! Do it! Come on!
come on
come on.
Hey, hey, hey! All right! Wait!
I'm gonna open it.
what happened? - Nothing.
my ass. - Dean, I'm fine.
yeah? And what about Brady?
like you said...
...we need him.
God. The day I've had.
good news.
you're going to live forever.
what did you do?
went over to a demons' nest -- Had a little massacre.
must be losing my touch, though
let one of the little toads live.
OO.
so might have given said toad thimpression
that you left your pos last night
because you and I are
wait for it
Lors in league againssan.
Hello, darling.
so, now death is off the table.
now you get to be on the boss' eternal-torment list
with little old me.
Oh,no,no, no, no
something else we have in common
apart from our torrid passion, of course
Craven self-preservation.
so, now, why don't you tell me where Pestilence is at?
Oh, God, Growley
was that a hellhound
I say yeah.
why was that a hellhound
what's that
remember I was telling you about my crafty little tracking device?
yeah
demons planted one on me.
you're saying a hellhound followed you here?
well, technically, he followed this.
get me out of here. I'll tell you anything you want.
shut up. - Ok, well, then we should go.
sorry, boys. No one knows more about the hounds than I.
you're long past the point of go.
damn it. I told you!
Oh, well, good for you.
luckily, we have salt in the kitch.
I'll watch Brady.
watch me?
get me the hell out of here!
salt?
damn it, get me out of here!
shut up! Shut up!
great. Just great.
hey
you're back?
I'm in invested.
currently.
stay
you can control them?
not that one
I brought my own
mine bigger.
si him, boy!
I'll wager $1,000 my pup wins
Yeal. I'm sure pestilence will be there.
Thanks.
what do you think?
it's good.
you got no reason to lie, have you?
like I said before, you're in my boat now.
you've screwed me -- For etnity.
Nah.
won't last that long.
trust me.
where are you going?
I'm going to do you a favor
I expect we'll be in touch.
what is this?
all those angels, all those demons,
all those sons of bitches
they just don't get it, do they, Sammy?
no, they don't, Dean.
you see, Brady...
we're the ones you should be afraid of.
I bet this is a real moment for you, big boy.
gonna make you feel all better?
it's a start.
gonna make up for all the times
that we yanked your chain
yellow eyes, Ruby, me?
but it wasn't all our fault, was it? No, no, no, no.
you're the one who trusted us.
you're the one who let us into your life,
let us whisper in your ear over and over and over again.
ever wonder why that is, Sammy?
ever wonder why we were so in your blind spot?
maybe it's because we got the same stuff in our veins
and, deep down, you know you're just like us.
maybe you hate us so much
Becausyou hate what you see Every time you look in the mirror.
you ever think of that?!
maybe the only difference
between you and a demon...
is your hell is right here.
interesting theory.
Yeah, I followed up.
nasty omens,
but none of it's death with a capital "d.
well, just give me a ring if it turns into anything.
and, Rufus...
you watch your ass out there.
chin up. Cavalry's arrived.
charming.
that won't work on me.
name's Crowley.
maybe you've...
you're Crowley?
in the flesh -- Of a moderately successful
literary agent out of New York.
I see you have heard of me.
I liked this suit.
what are you doing here?
looking out for Crowley.
Meaning...?
the boys are on to ring number 3,
but we still need number 4.
I'm here to help.
you know where death is?
no. Haven't the foggiest.
well, then get the hell off my property
before I blast you so full of rock salt,
you crap margaritas.
that's a mite unfriendly,
seeing as I could be getting you death's location
in about the time it'd take you to reload.
you're just gonna chat some demons up
and hope they don't recognize you?
God, no. Th could get me killed.
but there is this little spell that I know.
that so? - Results are 100% guaranteed.
okay. Then why are you snake-Oiling me?
well, it's a little bit...
...embarrassing.
there's this... technicality.
I need a little something to get the magic going.
and what's that?
you make a wish.
I can give you anything you want, mate
up to and including death's coordinates.
all I need is...
my soul.
I've done more with less.
let's just say when they're getting their grammys,
they shouldn't all be thanking god.
it's worth it, Bobby.
think.
okay.
here's my counter.
bloody hell!
feisty.
get out.
I'll give it right back.
you think I'm a natural-Born idiot?
quite the contrary.
look, you're right to be suspicious.
but I'm your ally.
enemy of my enemy and all that.
I need the devil back in his stock.
in fact, my delicate ass depends on it.
I promise you -- Temporary loan.
I'll give it... right...back.
what would I do without you?
No! Sam!
something turned him into a monster.
what are we dealing with? Do you know?
Croatoan. It's a virus of plague and pestilence.
who knows how far this thing can spread?
it's Crowley, right?
and why exactly would you want the devil dead?
survival.
if Lucifer manages to exterminate humankind,
we're next.
I'm just glad we got something to offer people.
well, I'm sorry. It's a load of crap
pure profit-Driven crap.
well, swine flu -- It's an epidemic.
Yeah, well, if niveus was really worried about the epidemic,
they'd be giving the vaccine out for free.
this supposed new formula?
well, they say it's faster-Acting.
maybe it is, but human trials this week?
Yeah, it does seem a little rushed.
a little rushed?
have you even seen the new vaccine?
no. - Yeah. Neither have I.
I have.
who the hell are you?
I'm running the experiment.
what the hell?!
relax. You're part of it, too.
well, looks like it works.
check it out -- I look like the king of pop.
too soon?
too soon.
don't get me wrong -- I'm glad the cdc is here,
but what we really need is vaccine.
you got that right.
well, tell me,
have you noticed anything unusual about the strain
any signs of behavioral change,
like aggression, maybe?
excuse me?
have the flu victims shown any signs of, uh,
homicidal tendencies?
symptomatically speaking, we're looking at
a relatively mild case of swine flu here.
probably add up to a miserable week off of work, - And that's about it. - So nothing unusual.
day and a half ago, we didn't have a single case.
now we're looking at over 70
the infectious equivalent a briefcase bomb.
so, yeah, I might call that a little unusual.
day and a half?
that's the Same time those statues started crying.
Yep. - I'm sorry.
what was that? - What was what?
did you just say a bunch of statues started crying?
what? Why, no. No. W-Who would
who would say that, huh? Crazy people.
exactly. - Yeah, which we are not.
no.
just... get us some vaccine.
let me guess -- Another steamin'-Hot pile of swine flu.
Yep.
doesn't make any sense, Bobby.
pestilence touched down here. I'm sure of it.
but why is he dealing them soft ser like swine flu
when he's got the croatoan virus up his sleeve?
I-I-I don't get it.
doesn't matter what the sick son of a bitch is doing.
what matters is this is the fourth town he's hit That we know of
and we're still eating his dust.
did you get anything?
we got even a snowball at probable next target?
uh, no pattern we can see.
okay.
hold on.
well, far as I can tell, he's still heading east,
so... head east, I guess.
East? East?
Bobby, we're in west nevada.
east is practically all there is.
Yeah, well, you better get to drivin
say...
I've got an idea.
did you get him? - He's gone.
fancy a fag and a chat?
you're upset. We should discuss it.
not here, but
you want to talk? Afte what you did to us?
after what I -- What I did to you?!
I gave you the colt!
Yeah, and you knew it wouldn't work against the devil!
I never! - You set us up.
we lost people on that suicide run
good people!
who you take on the ride is your own business!
look, everything is still the Same.
w-we're all still in this together.
sure we are.
call your dog off -- Please.
give me one good reason.
I can give you pestilence.
what do you know about pestilence?
I know how to get him.
that's got your interest, doesn't it - Are you actually listening to this? - Sam
are you friggin' nuts?! - Shut up for a second, Sam!
shut up, the both of you!
look...I swear...
I thought the colt would work. It's an honest mistake.
it's all part of the learning process.
but nothing's changed. I still want the devil dead.
well... one thing's changed.
now the devil knows that I want him dead.
which, by the way, Makes me the most buggered son in all of creation.
holy crap. We don't care.
they burnt down my house!
they ate my tailor!
two months under a rock, like a bloody salamander!
every demon on hell and earth's got his eyes out for me!
and yet... here I am...
last place I should be
in the road, talking to Sam and Dean Winchester,
under a friggin' spotlight!
so come with me. Please.
do you want the horsemen rings or not?
ye I know all about that.
shall we?
here we are
my life on the lam.
how the mighty have fallen.
single-pane glass,
used contraception in the fireplace.
the water damage alone
my heart's bleeding for you.
now, how do you know about the rings?
well, now...
I've been keeping a close eye on you lot.
we ot hex bags. We're hidden from demons.
all but one.
that night you broke into my house,
our first date,
my valet hid a tracking device in your car
a magical coin That easily trumps your little bags o' bones.
it allows me to hear things, too
and, my, the things I've heard.
so you want to cram the devil back in the box?
cunning scheme.
I want in.
you said you could get us pestilence.
well, now...
I don't know where pestilence is...
per se.
but I do know the demon who does.
he's what you might call the horsemen's stable boy.
he handles their itineraries, their personal needs.
he's who you want -- Believe me.
he'll tell us where sneezy's at.
well, how do we get him to spill?
rip out his toenails?
no.
nuts at his pay grade don't crack.
we bring him here, then I sell him.
sell him?
please. I've sold sin to saints for centuries.
think I can't close one little demon?
all right, so where's this demon of yours?
I don't want to hear "weeks.
I want to hear "days.
but the lab isn't even finished testing yet.
you let me worry about the lab.
but, sir, you're asking for distribution On an unprecedented scale.
well, we have an unprecedented outbreak.
the nation... is terrified of swine flu.
they want our vaccine. They need our vaccine.
it's called "demand," people. Now, supply!
we're doing our best.
Oh, you're doing your best?
you're doing your best?
well, then do the best of somebody better!
you wanted to see me?
Mitchell, yes. Come on in.
look, mr. Brad I know how important this is,
and I-I'm sorry if I sounded
no apologies.
Mitch, I need people like you.
Really?
really
in fact, there is a position in communications
that I think you would be perfect for.
sounds great.
is great. So what do you say?
you ready to enter The cutthroat world of upper management?
awesome.
awesome.
watch the shoes, please.
get the rest later. Thanks.
sir, great news.
the vaccine trials -- The results have been...
...really quite grotesque. I think you'll be pleased.
how soon?
distribution on this scale -- I mean, we do need some humans.
we can't possess them all.
and don't even get me started on the teamsters. I
I know. I'm doing my best.
Yes, sir.
the best of someone better.
I will. Of course.
why are we even listening to him, Dean?
this is totally insane. - I don't disagree.
one big happy family, are we, then? Fantastic.
you ready to go?
Yes. Yes. I am. Sam, keep the home fires burning.
what are you talking about?
Sam's not coming. - And why the hell not?
because I don't like you...
I don't trust you...
and -- Oh, yes
you keep trying to kill me.
there's no damn way.
this isn't gonna happen!
I'm not asking you, am I? 'Cause you're not invited.
I'm asking you. What's it gonna be?
gentlemen...
enjoy your last few sunsets.
wait.
I'll go.
what can I say? I believe the guy.
and then Dean just walks...
...right out the door with Crowley.
well, look, Sam, I got no love for demons,
and, yeah, this whole thing is crazy, But...
I don't know.
after a year of chasing up zilch,
maybe it's time to go crazy.
Yeah, maybe.
Hey, Bobby?
yeah?
remember that time you were possessed?
Yeah. Rings a bell.
when Meg told you to kill Dean, you didn't.
you took your body back.
just long enough to shank myself, yeah.
well, how'd you do it?
I mean, how'd you take back the wheel?
why are you asking, Sam?
say we can open the cage.
great. But then what?
w-we just lead the devil to the edge And get him to jump in?
you got me.
what if you guys lead the devil to the edge And I jump in?
it'd be just like When you turned the knife around on yourself.
one action -- Just one leap.
are you idiots trying to kill me?! - Bobby
we just got done talking your brother off the ledge,
and now you're lining up to say "yes"?
it's not like that. I'm not gonna do it.
not unless we all agree.
but I think we got to look at our options.
this isn't an option, Sam.
why not? - You can't do it.
what I did was a million-To-One,
and that was some pissant demon I was brain-Wrestling.
you're talking about Taking back control from satan himself.
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
kid...
it's called "possession" for a reason.
you, of all people, ought to know.
I'm strong enough. - You ain't.
he's gonna find every chink in your armor, Sam,
and use it against you
your fear, your grief, your anger.
and let's face it -- You're not exactly mr. Anger management.
how are you gonna control the devil
when you can't control yourself?
demons?
Nah. Human shields.
the demons are up top -- 12th floor.
all right, then. We'll have to find a way in through the back.
you Winchesters make everything so complicated.
Ah, crap.
Oh, crap.
crap!
door's open!
what?
you killed them?
we're on a tight schedule.
come on.
now you're squeamish? Please.
go get 'em, tiger.
wh
you're not coming?
Oh, no. It's not safe up there.
there's demons. - Yeah, I get that.
look, just do what I told you,
a-and try to be convincing.
it'll work like a charm. Trust me.
what, no appointment?
kind of an 11th-Hour thing, you know?
well, then, you're just on time.
have a seat.
how's your brother?
well, down to business, then.
what can I do for you?
actually, it's about what I can do for you.
Really?
me and Sam dropped two of your jockeys. I think you know that.
Yes. I got the memo.
well, we kept their, uh, - secret power rings. - Mm.
which is why I'm here. - mm.
I heard some folks saying that you wanted them back - And you were willing to pay. - Hmm.
where are they? - Not here.
but you want them, you'll come with me
nice and civil
we'll get out of your little batcave here,
and we'll discuss a transaction.
who says I want them?
what?
Who...says... I want them?
you know... Folks.
see...
...war and famine,
even if I could cram the rings back on their bony fingers,
I doubt it would do much good.
they're withered husks right now
fetal position on the floor
all thanks to you.
so I don't want the rings.
what I want is retribution.
and I'm gonna rip it right out of your ass!
this...
...is so good.
therapeutic, for sure. You know, Dean,
I really owe you one, buddy, 'Cause I feel...
so...
much...
better!
Dean! Dean, where are you going?
??? We're just getting started!
good meeting, Dean.
you know, I'm excited.
evening, uncle.
what the hell was that?
that was perfect
perfect?
he didn't want the rings. He wanted me.
imagine the surprise on your face.
what?
your ignorance and misinformation -- I mean, completely authentic.
you can't fake that.
what? I-It went like clockwork.
not for me, you son of a bitch!
that's what you get -- Working with a demon.
Hey, hot stuff, watch the upholstery!
up yours, mate.
this bit of carving will tie our friend here down.
no zapping off, no smoking out
locked in the meat suit...
an important piece of our bargaining strategy.
now, up here, we don't want I-50.
take 93 north.
what are you talking about?
look, we can't take this guy back to your brother.
why the hell not?
they got history, all right?
you want to go anywhere, you start talking.
what history?
Where's Dean?
now...
for the record, I'm against this.
negotiating a high-Level defection
it's very delicate business.
what are you talking about?
I begged Dean not to come back.
we should be miles away... from you.
he replied with a colorful rejoinder
about my "corn chute.
so, go ahead.
go -- Ruin our last best hope.
it's only the end of the world.
what's going on, Dean?
I need you to stay on mission, okay?
focused.
I don't understand. What's all this about?
I'm doing this 'cause I trust you.
trust me to what?
Sam, is that you?
Brady hasn't been Brady in years.
not since, oh... middle of our sophomore year?
what? - That's right.
you had a devil on your shoulder even back then.
all right, now, let it all sink in.
you son of a bitch.
you son of a bitch! You introduced me to Jess!
Ding, ding! I think he's got it!
damn it, Sam! I'm gonna kill you!
Hey! That's enough!
get out of my way! - No.
get out of my way, Dean.
there is only one way to win,
and it ain't by killing that thing in there.
well...
sounds like you got him nice and fluffed.
thanks so much.
listen to me.
we need pestilence to get at the devil,
and we need Brady to get to pestilence.
Why? Because Crowley said so?
because we trust him now?
like I trusted Ruby?
or like I trusted Brady back at school?
look... do the math yourself.
if Lucifer wins,
he'll turn this place into his kingdom.
when the morningstar cleans house,
we all get the mop.
he created us.
why would he destroy us?
that makes no sense.
look at who
at what he is.
then take a look at what we are.
maybe you should be a little less worried
about our necks
and be a little more worried about yours.
has crossed my mind. That's not really the point.
actually, Crowley, that is the point.
no one will know greater torment than you.
Lucifer is never gonna let you die.
as for me, I know the score.
I'm dead, whether I tell you anything or not.
so I think I'll die on the winning side, thanks.
good talk.
Cheers.
well, how'd it go? He buy your girl scout cookies?
not yet.
Where's your moose?
he's cooling off.
all right, then.
get bent.
you going somewhere?
well, he won't budge,
so now I go stick my neck out.
what are you gonna do?
exactly the kind of desperate swashbuckle I've been trying to avoid.
now I go kick open a hive of demons.
this whole bloody ring business better work.
Oh Sam Come on
hey
open the door
open the door
well, here we go.
we doing last words or no?
sophomore year, huh?
Brady, here, he was a good kid
straight arrow. I mean, your best friend, really.
perfect point of access.
Thanksgiving.
Yes, sir.
remember when I came back from break all messed up
dropped out of pre-Med, the drugs, the bitches?
that was the new Brady. That was me.
remember how much time you spent
trying to get me back on the right track?
you really were a good friend.
but ol' yellow eyes didn't send me back to be your friend.
no, we could tell we were starting to lose you.
you were becoming a mild-Mannered, Worthless sack of piss.
now, come on. We couldn't have that.
you were our favorite.
so I hooked you up With a pure, sweet, innocent piece of tail.
and then I toasted her on the ceiling.
that's right -- Azazel might have put the hit out on Jessica,
but, man, I got to have all the fun!
you know, she thought we were friends, too.
let me right in.
she was baking cookies.
she was so surprised...
so hurt when I started in on her.
come on!
do it if it'll make you feel better!
do it, Sammy! Do it! Come on!
come on
come on.
Hey, hey, hey! All right! Wait!
I'm gonna open it.
what happened? - Nothing.
my ass. - Dean, I'm fine.
yeah? And what about Brady?
like you said...
...we need him.
God. The day I've had.
good news.
you're going to live forever.

enemy of my enemy and all that.
I need the devil back in his stock.
in fact, my delicate ass depends on it.
I promise you -- Temporary loan.
I'll give it... right...back.
then
what would I do without you?
No! - Sam!
something turned him into a monster.
what are we dealing with? Do you know?
Croatoan. It's a virus of plague and pestilence.
who knows how far this thing can spread?
it's Crowley, right?
and why exactly wouldyouwant the devil dead?
survival.
if Lucifer manages to exterminate humankind, we're next.
the cage you sprung Lucifer from
you can shove his ass back in.
the key to the cage
four rings from the horsemen.
well, we got war's.
we nicked famine's.
that's two rings down.
collect all four.
just need pestilence and death.
Oh, is that all?
now
I'm just glad we got something to offer people.
well, I'm sorry it's a load of crap
pure profit-driven crap.
well, swine flu -- it's an epidemic.
Yeah, well, if niveus was really worried about the epidemic, they'd be giving the vaccine out for free.
this supposed new formula?
well, they say it's faster-acting.
maybe it is, but human trials this week?
Yeah, it does seem a little rushed.
a little rushed?
have you even seen the new vaccine?
no. Yeah.
neither have I. - I have.
who the hell are you?
I'm running the experiment.
what the hell? !
relax. You're part of it, too.
well, looks like it works.
check it out -- I look like the king of pop.
too soon?
too soon.
don't get me wrong -- I'm glad the cdc is here, but what we really need is vaccine.
you got that right.
well, tell me, have you noticed anything unusual about the strain any signs of behavioral change, like aggression, maybe?
excuse me?
have the flu victims shown any signs of, uh, homicidal tendencies?
symptomatically speaking, we're looking at a relatively mild case of swine flu here.
probably add up to a miserable week off of work, and that's about it.
so nothing unusual.
day and a half ago, we didn't have a single case.
now we're looking at over 70
the infectious equivalent of a briefcase bomb.
so, yeah, I might call that a little unusual.
day and a half?
that's the same time those statues started crying. - Yep.
I'm sorry. What was that? - What was what?
did you just say a bunch of statues started crying?
what? Why, no. No. W-who would
who would say that, huh? Crazy people. - Exactly.
Yeah, which we are not. - No.
just... Get us some vaccine.
let me guess
another steamin'-hot pile of swine flu. - Yep.
doesn't make any sense, Bobby. Pestilence touched down here. I'm sure of it.
but why is he dealing them soft serve like swine flu when he's got the croatoan virus up his sleeve?
I-I don't get it.
doesn't matter what the sick son of a bitch is doing.
what matters is this is the fourth town he's hit that we know of
and we're still eating his dust.
did you get anything?
we got even a snowball at probable next target?
uh, no pattern we can see.
okay. Hold on.
well, far as I can tell, he's still heading east, so...
head east, I guess.
East?
Bobby, we're in west Nevada.
east is practically all there is.
Yeah, well, you better get to drivin'.
say... I've got an idea.
did you get him? - He's gone.
fancy a fag and a chat?
you're upset. We should discuss it.
not here, but -- you want to talk?
after what you did to us?
after what I -- what I did to you? !
I gave you the Colt!
Yeah, and you knew it wouldn't work against the devil!
I never! - You set us up.
we lost people on that suicide run -- good people!
who you take on the ride is your own business!
look, everything is still the same.
w-we're all still in this together.
sure we are.
call your dog off -- please.
give me one good reason.
I can give you pestilence.
what do you know about pestilence?
I know how to get him.
that's got your interest, doesn't it?
are you actually listening to this?
Sam -- - are you friggin' nuts? !
shut up for a second, Sam!
shut up, the both of you!
look... I swear... I thought the Colt would work.
it's an honest mistake.
it's all part of the learning process.
but nothing's changed.
I still want the devil dead.
well... One thing's changed.
now the devil knows that I want him dead.
which, by the way, makes me the most buggered son in all of creation.
holy crap. We don't care.
they burnt down my house!
they ate my tailor!
two months under a rock, like a bloody salamander!
every demon on hell and earth's got his eyes out for me!
and yet... Here I am...
last place I should be
in the road, talking to sam and dean winchester, under a friggin' spotlight!
so come with me. Please.
do you want the horsemen rings or not?
Yes, I know all about that. Shall we?
here we are
my life on the lam.
how the mighty have fallen.
single-pane glass, used contraception in the fireplace.
the water damage alone
my heart's bleeding for you.
now, how do you know about the rings?
well, now...
I've been keeping a close eye on you lot.
we got hex bags. We're hidden from demons.
all but one.
that night you broke into my house, our first date, my valet hid a tracking device in your car
a magical coin that easily trumps your little bags.
it allows me to hear things, too
and, my, the things I've heard.
so you want to cram the devil back in the box?
cunning scheme.
I want in.
you said you could get us pestilence.
well, now...
I don't know where pestilenceis...
but I do know the demon who does.
he's what you might call the horsemen's stable boy.
he handles their itineraries, their personal needs.
he's who you want -- believe me.
he'll tell us where sneezy's at.
well, how do we get him to spill? Rip out his toenails?
no.
nuts at his pay grade don't crack.
we bring him here, then I sell him.
sell him?
please. I've sold sin to saints for centuries.
think I can't close one little demon?
all right, so where's this demon of yours?
I don't want to hear "weeks."
I want to hear "days."
but the lab isn't even finished testing yet.
you let me worry about the lab.
but, sir, you're asking for distribution on an unprecedented scale.
well, we have an unprecedented outbreak.
the nation is terrified of swine flu.
they want our vaccine.
they need our vaccine.
it's called "demand," people. Now, supply!
we're doing our best.
Oh, you're doing your best? You're doing your best?
well, then do the best of somebody better!
you wanted to see me?
Mitchell, yes. Come on in.
look, Mr. Brady, I know how important this is, and I-I'm sorry if I sounded
no apologies.
Mitch, I need people like you.
Really? - Really.
in fact, there is a position in communications that I think you would be perfect for.
sounds great. - Is great. So what do you say?
you ready to enter the cut throat world of upper management?
awesome. - Awesome.
watch the shoes, please.
get the rest later. Thanks.
sir, great news. The vaccine trials -- the results have been...
really quite grotesque.
I think you'll be pleased.
soon?
distribution on this scale -- I mean, we do need some humans.
we can't possess them all. And don't even get me started on the teamsters. I
I know. I'm doing my best.
Yes, sir.
the best of someone better.
I will. Of course.
why are we even listening to him, Dean?
this is totally insane.
I don't disagree.
one big happy family, are we, then?
fantastic.
you ready to go?
Yes. Yes. I am.
Sam, keep the home fires burning.
what are you talking about?
Sam's not coming.
and why the hell not?
because I don't like you...
I don't trust you...
and -- oh, yes -- you keep trying to kill me.
there's no damn way.
this isn't gonna happen!
I'm not asking you, am I? 'Cause you're not invited.
I'm asking you. What's it gonna be?
gentlemen...
enjoy your last few sunsets.
wait.
I'll go.
what can I say? I believe the guy.
and then Dean just walks...
right out the door with Crowley.
well, look, Sam, I got no love for demons, and, yeah, this whole thing is crazy, but...
I don't know.
after a year of chasing up zilch, maybe it's time to go crazy.
Yeah, maybe.
Hey, Bobby?
yeah?
uh... Remember that time you were possessed?
Yeah. Rings a bell.
when Meg told you to kill Dean, you didn't.
you took your body back.
just long enough to shank myself, yeah.
well, how'd you do it?
I mean, how'd you take back the wheel?
why are you asking, Sam?
say we can open the cage.
great. But then what?
w-we just lead the devil to the edge and get him to jump in?
you got me.
what if you guys lead the devil to the edge and I jump in?
Sam. - It'd be just like when you turned the knife around on yourself.
one action -- just one leap.
are you idiots trying to kill me? ! - Bobby
we just got done talking your brother off the ledge, and now you're lining up to say "yes"?
it's not like that. I'm not gonna do it.
not unless we all agree.
but I think we got to look at our options.
this isn't an option, Sam. - Why not?
you can't do it.
what I did was a million-to-one, and that was some pissant demon I was brain-wrestling.
you're talking about taking back control from Satan himself.
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
kid...
it's called "possession" for a reason.
you, of all people, ought to know.
I'm strong enough. - You ain't.
he's gonna find every chink in your armor, Sam, and use it against you
your fear, your grief, your anger.
and let's face it -- you're not exactly Mr. Anger Management.
how are you gonna control the devil when you can't control yourself?
demons?
Nah. Human shields.
the demons are up top -- 12th floor.
all right, then. We'll have to find a way in through the back.
you Winchesters make everything so complicated.
Ah, crap.
Oh, crap. Crap! Crap!
door's open!
what?
you killed them?
we're on a tight schedule. Come on.
now you're squeamish? Please.
go get 'em, tiger.
you're not coming?
Oh, no. It's not safe up there. There's demons.
Yeah, I get that.
look, just do what I told you, and try to be convincing.
it'll work like a charm. Trust me.
what, no appointment?
kind of an 11th-hour thing, you know?
well, then, you're just on time.
have a seat.
how's your brother?
well, down to business, then.
what can I do for you?
actually, it's about what I can do for you.
Really?
me and Sam dropped two of your jockeys.
I think you know that.
Yes. I got the memo.
well, we kept their, uh, secret power rings.
which is why I'm here.
I heard some folks saying that you wanted them back and you were willing to pay.
where are they? - Not here.
but you want them, you'll come with me
nice and civil
we'll get out of your little batcave here, and we'll discuss a transaction.
who says I want them?
what?
who... Says... I want them?
you know...
folks.
see...
war and famine, even if I could cram the rings back on their bony fingers, I doubt it would do much good.
they're withered husks right now
so I don't want the rings.
what I want is retribution.
and I'm gonna rip it right out of your ass!
this is so good.
therapeutic, for sure.
you know, Dean, I really owe you one, buddy,'cause I feel...
so... Much... Better!
no.
Dean, where are you going?
we're just getting started!
good meeting, Dean. You know, I'm excited.
evening, uncle.
what the hell was that?
that was perfect.
perfect?
he didn't want the rings. He wanted me.
imagine the surprise on your face. - What?
your ignorance and misinformation -- I mean, completely authentic.
you can't fake that.
what? It went like clockwork.
not for me, you son of a bitch!
that's what you get -- working with a demon.
Hey, hot stuff, watch the upholstery!
up yours, mate.
this bit of carving will tie our friend here down.
no zapping off, no smoking out
locked in the meat suit...
an important piece of our bargaing strategy.
now, up here, we don't want I-50.
take 93 north.
what are you talking about?
look, we can't take this guy back to your brother.
why the hell not?
they got history, all right?
you want to go anywhere, you start talking.
what history?
Where's Dean?
now...
for the record, I'm against this.
what are you talking about?
I begged Dean not to come back.
we should be miles away... From you.
he replied with a colorful rejoinder about my "corn chute."
so, go ahead.
go -- ruin our last best hope.
it's only the end of the world.
Sam. - What's going on, Dean?
I need you to stay on mission, okay? Focused.
I don't understand. What's all this about?
I'm doing this 'cause I trust you.
trust me to what?
Sam, is that you?
Brady hasn't been Brady in years.
not since, oh...
middle of our sophomore year?
what? - That's right.
you had a devil on your shoulder even back then.
all right, now, let it all sink in.
you son of a bitch.
you son of a bitch! You introduced me to Jess!
Ding, ding! I think he's got it!
damn it, Sam! - I'm gonna kill you!
that's enough!
get out of my way!
no.
get out of my way, Dean.
there is only one way to win, and it ain't by killing that thing in there.
well...
sounds like you got him nice and fluffed.
thanks so much.
listen to me.
we need pestilence to get at the devil, and we need Brady to get to pestilence.
Why? Because Crowley said so?
because we trust him now?
like I trusted Ruby?
or like I trusted Brady back at school?
look...
do the math yourself.
if Lucifer wins, he'll turn this place into his kingdom.
when the morningstar cleans house, we all get the mop.
he created us.
why would he destroy us? That makes no sense.
look at who -- at what he is.
then take a look at what we are.
maybe you should be a little less worried about our necks and be a little more worried about yours.
has crossed my mind.
that's not really the point.
actually, Crowley, that is the point.
no one will know greater torment than you.
Lucifer is never gonna let you die.
as for me, I know the score.
I'm dead, whether I tell you anything or not.
so I think I'll die on the winning side, thanks.
good talk. Cheers.
well, how'd it go? He buy your girl scout cookies?
not yet.
Where's your moose?
he's cooling off.
all right, then.
get bent.
you going somewhere?
well, he won't budge, so now I go stick my neck out.
what are you gonna do?
exactly the kind of desperate swashbuckle I've been trying to avoid.
now I go kick open a hive of demons.
this whole bloody ring business better work.
come on, Sam!
Sam, come on!
open the door!
well, here we go.
we doing last words or no?
sophomore year, huh?
Brady, here, he was a good kid
straight arrow. I mean, your best friend, really.
perfect point of access.
Thanksgiving. - Yes, sir.
remember when I came back from break all messed up
dropped out of pre-med, the drugs, the bitches?
that was the new Brady. That was me.
remember how much time you spent trying to get me back on the right track?
you really were a good friend.
but yellow eyes didn't send me back to be your friend.
no, we could tell we were starting to lose you.
you were becoming a mild-mannered, worthless sack of piss.
now, come on. We couldn't have that.
you were our favorite.
so I hooked you up with a pure, sweet, innocent piece of tail.
and then I toasted her on the ceiling.
that's right -- Azel might have put the hit out on Jessica, but, man, I got to have all the fun!
you know, she thought we were friends, too.
let me right in.
she was baking cookies.
she was so surprised...
so hurt when i started in on her.
come on! Do it if it'll make you feel better!
do it, Sammy! Do it! Come on!
come on.
come on.
Hey, hey, hey! All right! Wait! I'm gonna open it.
what happened?
nothing. - My ass.
Dean, I'm fine. - Yeah? And what about Brady?
like you said...
we need him.
God. The day I've had.
good news.
you're going to live forever.
what did you do?
went over to a demons' nest
had a little massacre.
must be losing my touch, though
let one of the little toads live.
also might have given said toad the impression that you left your post last night because you and I are
wait for it
lovers in league against Satan.
Hello, darling.
so, now death is off the table.
now you get to be on the boss's eternal-torment list with little old me.
Oh, no, no, no, no. No.
something else we have in common
apart from our torrid passion, of course
Craven self-preservation.
so, now, why don't you tell me where pestilence is at?
Oh, god, Crowley.
was that a hellhound?
I'd say yeah.
why was that a hellhound?
what's that? - Remember I was telling you about my crafty little tracking device?
Yeah. - Demons planted one onme.
you're saying a hellhound followed you here?
well, technically, he followed this.
get me out of here. I'll tell you anything you want.
shut up. - Okay, well, then we should go.
sorry, boys. No one knows more about the hounds than I.
you're long past the point of "go."
damn it. - I told you!
Oh, well, good for you.
luckily, we have salt in the kitchen.
I'll watch Brady.
watch me?
get me the hell out of here!
salt?
damn it, get me out of here!
shut up! - Great. Just great.
you're back?
I'm invested. Currently.
stay!
you can control them?
not that one.
I brought my own. Mine's bigger.
SiC him, boy!
go
I'll wager $1, 000 my pup wins.
what do you think?
it's good.
you got no reason to lie, have you?
like I said before, you're in my boat now.
you've screwed me -- for eternity.
Nah. Won't last that long. Trust me.
where are you going?
I'm going to do you a favor.
I expect we'll be in touch.
what is this?
all those angels, all those demons, all those sons of bitches
they just don't get it, do they, Sammy?
no, they don't, Dean.
you see, Brady...
we're the ones you should be afraid of.
I bet this is a real moment for you, big boy.
gonna make you feel all better?
it's a start.
gonna make up for all the times that we yanked your chain
yellow eyes, Ruby, me?
but it wasn't all our fault, was it? No, no, no, no.
you're the one who trusted us.
you're the one who let us into your life, let us whisper in your ear over and over and over again.
ever wonder why that is, Sammy?
ever wonder why we were so in your blind spot?
maybe it's because we got the same stuff in our veins and, deep down, you know you're just like us.
maybe you hate us so much because you hate what you see every time you look in the mirror.
you ever think of that?!
maybe the only difference between you and a demon...
is your hell is right here.
interesting theory.
Yeah, I followed up.
nasty omens, but none of it's death with a capital "d."
well, just give me a ring if it turns into anything.
you watch your ass out there.
chin up. Cavalry's arrived.
charming.
that won't work on me.
name's Crowley. - Maybe you've... - You're C rowley?
in the flesh of a moderately successful literary agent out of New York.
I see you have heard of me.
I liked this suit.
what are you doing here?
looking out for Crowley.
Meaning...?
the boys are on to ring number 3, but we still need number 4.
I'm here to help.
you know where death is?
no. Haven't the foggiest.
well, then get the hell off my property before I blast you so full of rock salt, you crap margaritas.
that's a mite unfriendly, seeing as I could be getting you death's location in about the time it'd take you to reload.
you're just gonna chat some demons up and hope they don't recognize you?
God, no. That could get me killed.
but there is this little spell that I know.
that so? - Results are 100% guaranteed.
okay. Then why are you snake-oiling me?
well, it's a little bit...
embarrassing.
there's this... Technicality.
I need a little something to get the magic going.
and what's that?
you make a wish.
I can give you anything you want, mate
up to and including death's coordinates.
all I need is...
my soul.
I've done more with less.
let's just say when they're getting their Grammys, they shouldn't all be thanking God.
it's worth it, Bobby.
think.
okay.
here's my counter.
bloody hell!
feisty.
get out.
I'll give it right back.
you think I'm a natural-born idiot?
quite the contrary.
look, you're right to be suspicious.
but I'm your ally.
enemy of my enemy and all that.
I need the devil back in his stock.
in fact, my delicate ass depends on it.
you think adam's okay?
No! N-No!
doubt it.
cass either.
the cage you sprung lucifer from
you can shove his ass back in.
key to the cage -- Four rings from the horsemen.
well, we got war's. We nicked famine's.
that's two rings down.
collect all four.
I can give you pestilence.
do you want the horsemen rings or not?
what are we dealing with? Do you know?
croatoan. Virus of plague and pestilence.
more like demonic germ warfare.
they want our vaccine.
they need our vaccine.
it's called "demand," people. Now, supply!
sir, great news.
the vaccine trials -- The results have been...
...really quite grotesque. I think you'll be pleased.
Oh, hello, death.
you make a wish.
I can give you anything you want, mate
up to and including death's coordinates.
all I need is...
my soul.
say we can open the cage.
but then what?
what if you guys lead the devil to the edge
and I jump in?
now
Dr. Green, how was your trip?
Oh, very productive.
and how are we tonight, celeste, my favorite patient?
the nurse says you can't sleep.
Oh, I just feel worse and worse.
well, that's
because you're suffering from a combination Of the common cold...
dengue fever...
and a nasty, nasty case of japanese encephalitis.
what are you...
I'm sorry. I
Oh, you heard me.
Oh, and look at that.
you never had chicken pox as a child.
Oh, this is gonna be fascinating.
but I -- H-How could I...
have all those diseases at once?
well, it's a proprietary blend.
I mix it up in a petri dish
the petri dish being... you.
try and relax. It'll be all right.
are you... gonna c-Cure me?
no.
you're going to die.
in four, three... Two...
interesting.
what the hell is wrong with you?
Dean -- - No, don't "dean" me.
I mean, you -- You have had some stupid ideas in the past, But this
d-did you know about this? - What?
about sam's genius plan To say yes to the devil?
well, thanks for the heads up! - Hey, this ain't about me.
you can't do this. - That's the consensus.
all right. Awesome. Then, end of discussion.
this isn't over.
Hello?
is he okay?
we all thought you were dead. Where the hell are you, man?
a hospital. - Are you okay?
no.
you want to elaborate?
I just woke up here.
the doctors were fairly surprised. They thought I was brain-Dead.
S-So, a hospital?
apparently, after van nuys,
I suddenly appeared, bloody and unconscious, On a shrimping boat off delacroix.
I'm told it upset the sailors.
well, I got to tell you, man -- You're just in time.
we figured out a way to pop satan's box.
how? - It's a long story, but, look -- We're going after pestilence now.
so if you want to zap over here...
I can't "zap" anywhere.
what do you mean?
you could say my batteries are -- Are drained.
what do you mean? You're out of angel mojo?
I'm saying that I am thirsty and my head aches.
I have a bug bite that itches no matter how much I scratch it,
and I'm saying that I'm just incredibly...
human.
Wow.
sorry. - Well, my point is
I can't go anywhere without money For...
an airplane ride.
and food.
and more pain medication, ideally.
all right. Well, look, no worries.
Bobby's here. He'll wire you the cash.
Dean, wait. - I will?
you said "no" to michael.
I owe you an apology.
Cass... I-It's okay.
you are not the burnt and broken shell of a man
that I believed you to be.
thank you.
I appreciate that. - You're welcome.
be careful.
so this is dr. Evil's lair, huh?
it's kind of more depressing than evil.
it's like a four-Color brochure for dying young.
of course, to pestilence, it's probably dollywood in there.
great.
a whole building full of people.
we don't know who's human, Who's demon, and who's pestilence.
so what do we do?
hang on.
Hey. Hi. Uh, I'm looking for my nana.
her name is eunice kennedy.
go around front and see the nurse.
you mind just helping me out, sir?
she's about, uh, about that small And gray hair, wears diapers.
that's the beauty about improv, sammy.
you never know what's gonna come out of your mouth.
so, what are
Hey.
what are we even looking for?
well, he's pestilence, so he probably looks sick.
everybody looks sick.
Hey.
Oh, now we're talking.
Dr. Green, how was your trip?
Oh, very productive.
and how are we tonight, celeste, my favorite patient?
sir...
...the winchesters are here.
we should go.
are you kidding me?
they have a track record with horsemen.
you mean my brothers.
what they did to my brothers.
no.
the only reasonable thing to do here is to...
take it out of their healthy young asses.
we're under strict orders not to kill the vessels.
Oh, if satan wants them so bad, He can glue them back together!
come. Come.
now then.
page me if she's dying. - ???
must be getting close.
you think?
the doctor will see you now.
come right in.
you boys don't look well.
it might be the, uh, scarlet fever.
or, uh, the meningitis.
or the syphilis.
that's no fun.
however you feel right now?
it's gonna get so very, very much worse.
questions?
disease gets a bad rap, don't you think?
for being filthy. chaotic.
uh, but, really, t-that just describes people who get sick.
disease itself...
very...pure...
single-minded.
bacteria have one purpose -- divide and conquer.
that's why, in the end...
it always wins.
so, you've got to wonder why god pours all his love into something so messy...
...and weak.
it's ridiculous.
all I can do is show him he's wrong, one epidemic at a time.
now...
on a scale of 1 to 10, how's your pain?
how'd you get here?
I took a bus. don't worry, I
well, look at that.
an occupied vessel, but powerless.
Oh, that's fascinating.
there's not a speck of angel in you, is there?
maybe just a speck.
it doesn't matter.
it's too late.
well, it's nice to actually score a home run for once, ain't it?
what?
last thing pestilence said.
it's too late.
he get specific?
no.
we're just a little freaked out that he might have left a bomb somewhere.
so please tell us you have actual good news.
chicago's about to be wiped off the map.
storm of the millennium.
sets off a daisy chain of natural disasters.
three million people are gonna die.
I don't understand your definition of good news.
well...
death, the horseman -- he's gonna be there.
and if we can stop him before he kick-starts this storm, - get his ring back -- - yeah, you make it sound so easy.
well...
Bobby, h-how'd you put all this together, anyways?
I had, you know...help.
don't be so modest.
I barely helped at all.
Hello, boys.
pleasure, et cetera.
go ahead. tell them.
there's no shame in it.
tell us what?
world's gonna end.
seems stupid to get all precious over one little...soul.
you sold your soul?
Oh, more like pawned it. I fully intend to give it back.
well, then give it back!
I will. - now!
did you kiss him? - sam!
just wondering.
No!
why'd you take a picture?
why do you have to use tongue?
all right. you know what? I'm sick of this.
give him his soul back now.
I'm sorry. I can't. - can't or won't?
I won't, all right? it's insurance.
what are you talking about? - you kill demons.
gigantor over there has a temper issue about it.
but you won't kill me...
as long as I have that soul in the deposit box.
you son of a bitch.
I'll return it.
after all this is over, and I can walk safely away.
do we all understand each other?
let me guess. we're about to have a talk.
look, Dean, um...
for the record...
I agree with you.
about me.
you think I'm too weak to take on lucifer.
well, so do I.
believe me, I know exactly how screwed up I am.
you, bobby, cass...
I'm the least of any of you.
Oh, sam... - no, it's true. it is.
but...
I'm also all we got.
if there was another way...
...but I don't think there is.
there's just me.
so I don't know what else to do.
except just try t-to do what's got to be done.
and...
scene.
there's something you need to see.
niveus pharmaceuticals is rushing delivery of its new swine-flu vaccine to "stem the tide of the unprecedented outbreak.
uh, shipments leave wednesday.
niveus pharmaceuticals.
get it?
you two are lucky you have your looks.
your demon lover, brady?
V. p. of distribution, niveus.
Ah, yes, that the sound of the abacus clacking?
we all caught up?
so, pestilence was spreading swine flu.
Yeah, but not just for giggles.
that was step one. step two is the vaccine.
and you think -- - I know.
I'll stake my reputation
that vaccine is chock-full of grade-a, farm-fresh croatoan virus.
simultaneous, countrywide distribution.
it's quite a plan.
they don't get to be horsemen for nothing.
so, you boys better stock up on...
well, everything.
this time next thursday, oh, death oh, death oh, death won't you spare me over another year?
but what is this that I can't see with ice-cold hands taking hold of me?
watch where you're walking, pal.
when god is gone and the devil takes hold who will have mercy on your soul?
Oh, death oh, death my name is death, and the end is here what's your problem?
this is what they mean by "the 11th hour," right?
pretty much.
well, it's the 11th hour, and I am useless.
all I have is this. what am I even supposed to do with it?
point it and shoot.
what I used to be
are you really gonna bitch -- to me?
quit pining for the varsity years...
and load the damn truck.
all right, well...
good luck stopping the whole zombie apocalypse.
Yeah.
good luck killing death.
Yeah.
remember when we used to just... hunt wendigos?
how simple things were?
not really.
well, um...
...you might need this.
keep it. dean's covered.
death's own.
kills, golly, demons and angels and reapers and, rumor has it, the very thing itself.
how did you get that?
hello -- king of the crossroads.
so, shall we?
Bobby, you just gonna sit there?
no, I'm gonna riverdance.
I suppose if you want to impress the ladies.
Bobby, bobby, bobby.
really wasted that crossroads deal.
fact -- you get more if you phrase it properly.
so, I took the liberty of adding a teeny little sub-a clause on your behalf.
what can I say?
I'm an altruist.
just gonna sit there?
son of a bitch.
Yes, I know. completely worth your soul.
I'm a hell of a guy.
Thanks.
this is getting maudlin.
can we go?
yes" to lucifer.
then jump in the hole.
it's an interesting plan.
that's a word for it. - so?
go ahead and tell me it's the worst plan you ever heard.
of course.
I am happy to say that if that's what you want to hear.
but it's not what I think.
Really?
you and dean have a habit of exceeding my expectations.
he resisted michael.
maybe you could resist lucifer.
but there are things that you would need to know.
like?
michael has found another vessel.
what?
it's your brother adam.
you must have considered it.
we were trying not to.
if you say yes to lucifer and then fail...
this fight will happen.
and the collateral...
it'll be immense.
there's also the demon blood.
what? what are you talking about?
to take in lucifer, it would be more than you've ever drunk.
but...why?
it strengthens the vessel.
keeps it from exploding.
but the guy he's in now
is drinking gallons.
and how is that not the worst plan you ever heard?
Yup, they're loading up hotshots of croatoan in the trucks.
okay. first truck don't leave for an hour.
we get in, we plant the c-4 every 25 feet, - then we pull the fire alarm. - that truck is leaving.
balls!
okay, new plan.
it's the winchesters.
well, then, let's bake them up a little treat.
help! - side door!
help me, please! help!
get back!
go. come on. go.
help me! please! help!
there's still people here.
Sam, no!
wait here.
damn.
Hey, let's stop for pizza.
are you kidding?
just heard it was good. that's all.
up ahead. big, ugly building.
ground zero.
horseman's stable, if you will.
he's in there.
how do you know?
have you met me?
cause I know.
also, the block is squirming with reapers.
I'll be right back.
boy, is my face red.
death's not in there.
you want to cut the cute and get to the part where you tell me where he is?
sorry. I don't know.
whoa, whoa, whoa. wait a minute.
you don't know?
signs pointed. I-I'm just as shocked as you.
Bobby sold his soul for this!
relax.
all deals are soul back or store credit.
we'll catch death in the next doomed city.
millions, crowley.
millions of people are about to die any minute.
true.
so I strongly suggest we get out of here.
you okay?
go! go!
so, what?
call in a bomb threat? 1, 000 bomb threats?
I mean, how the hell am I supposed to get three million people out of chicago in the next 10 minutes?
come on!
what?
I can't hear you!
I said I found him.
death --he's in there.
you coming or...
...not.
go! go!
all clear.
actually, these things can be useful.
can we commit our act of domestic terrorism already? let's go.
thanks for returning that.
join me, dean.
the pizza's delicious.
sit down.
took you long enough to find me.
I've been wanting to talk to you.
I got to say
mixed feelings about that.
s-so is this the part where...
...where you kill me?
you have an inflated sense of your importance.
to a thing like me, a thing like you, well...
think how you'd feel if a bacterium sat at your table and started to get snarky.
this is one little planet in one tiny solar system in a galaxy that's barely out of its diapers.
I'm old, dean.
very old.
so I invite you to contemplate how insignificant I find you.
eat.
good, isn't it?
well, I got to ask.
how old are you?
as old as god.
maybe older.
neither of us can remember anymore.
life, death, chicken, egg.
regardless
at the end, I'll reap him, too.
God?
you'll reap god?
Oh, yes.
God will die, too, dean.
well, this is way above my pay grade.
just a bit.
so, then why am I still breathing, sitting here with you?
W-what do you want?
the leash around my neck --off.
Lucifer has me bound to him.
some unseemly little spell.
he has me where he wants, when he wants.
that's why I couldn't go to you.
I had to wait for you to catch up.
he made me his weapon.
hurricanes, floods, raising the dead.
I'm more powerful than you can process, and I'm enslaved to a bratty child with a temper tantrum.
and you think...
I can unbind you?
there's your ridiculous bravado again. of course you can't.
but you can help me take the bullets out of lucifer's gun.
I understand you want this.
Yeah.
I'm inclined to give it to you.
to give it to me?
that's what I said.
but what about...
Chicago?
I suppose it can stay.
I like the pizza.
there are conditions.
okay. like?
you have to do whatever it takes to put lucifer in his cell.
of course.
whatever it takes.
that's the plan. - no. no plan. not yet.
your brother.
he's the one that can stop lucifer. the only one.
what, you think -- - I know.
so, I need a promise.
you're going to let your brother jump right into that fiery pit.
well, do I have your word?
okay, yeah. yes.
that had better be "yes," dean.
you know you can't cheat death.
now, would you like the instruction manual?
well, how'd it go at the rockettes audition?
well, high kicks -- fair.
boobs need work.
I walked up and down stairs all night for no damn reason.
I'm sore.
feels so good, I'm scared it's a dream.
but then I remember that the world's dying bloody, so, drink?
check it out.
so death told you how to operate those? the whole deal?
Yeah. it's nuts.
of course, I got bigger problems now.
Really? like?
what do you think death does to people who lie to his face?
nothing good. - yeah.
What'd you say?
that I was cool with sam driving the bus on the whole lucifer plan.
so death thinks sam ought to say yes, huh?
I don't know. yeah.
but, I mean, of course he'd say that. he works for lucifer.
against his will, I thought he said.
well, I'd say, take his sob story with a fat grain of salt. I mean, he is death.
exactly. he's death.
think of the kind of bird's-eye view.
Seriously?
I'm just saying -- - well, don't.
I mean, what happened to you being against this?
look,
I'm not saying sam ain't an ass-full of character defects. but...
but what?
back at niveus?
I watched that kid pull one civilian out after another.
he must have saved 10 people. never stopped. never slowed down.
we're hard on him, dean.
we've always been.
but in the meantime...
he's been running into burning buildings since he was, what, 12?
pretty much.
look, sam's got a...
darkness in him.
I'm not saying he don't.
but he's got a hell of a lot of good in him, too.
I know.
then you know sam will beat the devil...
or die trying.
that's the best we could ask for.
so I got to ask, Dean.
what exactly are you afraid of?
losing?
or losing your brother?
then
Hey, Dean.
how long you been back? - About a year.
what have you been doing? - Hunting.
you been back practically this whole time?! -You finally had what you wanted, Dean.
I wanted my brother, alive.
you wanted a family.
you only gave it up because of the way we lived.
but you had something, and you were building something.
I need you to go. You're a hunter.
and now you know your brother's out there. Things are different.
you don't want to be here, Dean. - Yes, I do.
me and Ben will be here, and...
and you really think we could pull something like that off?
it's worth a shot.
archangels are fierce.
they're absolute.
they're heaven's most terrifying weapon.
Raphael.
come and get me, you little bastard.
when the oil burns, no angel can touch or pass through the flames, or he dies.
I'm warning you. Do not leave me here.
I will find you.
what are you gonna do now?
return to heaven, I suppose. - Heaven?
with Michael in the cage, I'm sure it's total anarchy up there.
now
Oh, come on.
what the hell?
come on, man. Let's get going.
ed, I think I'm bleeding.
the THIRD MAN
Hey, you.
Hey.
don't stop on my account.
I'm done.
last night was a...
high point, if you don't mind me saying.
good.
all right.
well, I see you need to start your day.
when did you say you were heading out?
you didn't. Right.
damn, you know how to play that mystery card.
right.
I almost forgot.
next time...You can call me on my night off.
if you want.
okay.
okay.
Hey. - Hey.
I'm about eight hours out of the Campbell Base.
uh, change of plans.
I need you to meet me. I'm in P. A. Town called Easter.
what are you doing in Pennsylvania?
caught a case.
a case?
when? It's been like a day and a half.
I like to work. - Apparently.
glad we hashed that out.
call me when you roll into town.
who died and made you boss?
Oh, you could do better than that.
why are you calling me?
he's dead, right? That's it.
now, I don't want to talk about it.
we do what we do
we go to work, we go to the funeral.
calm down.
this is nothing to do with you and me.
you're just working yourself up. Don't call me.
idiot.
God!
God!
dispatch, this is
please, I -- I need...
please.
Ben...I know you're lying.
because I lie professionally, that's how.
now tell your mom that you broke the damn thing and take it like a man.
okay? Ok okay.
Wow. - What?
you molding the minds of tomorrow. Who knew?
Yeah, tell me about it.
how'd it go? - With?
you and Lisa. How'd she take it when you bailed?
shockingly cool, actually.
better for everybody.
Yeah, I suppose.
still driving the plastic piece of crap, huh?
what's your mileage, again? - Shut up.
740 lincoln ave police department
officer Gerald Hatch 17-year veteran, found dead in the ready room three days ago.
somebody was over-hydrated.
basically, yeah. The guy just... Liquefied.
most of the meat, bones, dense tissues
they just turned to blood.
okay, I don't get it. - Nobody gets it.
no. I mean, I get that.
I'm saying, if the guy was a mop job, then what are we doing in the morgue?
what's left of him to look at?
not here to look at him.
here.
Ooh. Bad news.
officer Toby Gray.
they brought him in yesterday.
found him dead in his patrol car, sitting at a speed trap on the outside of town.
extreme allergic reaction.
Yeah. Boils. Covered from head to toe.
Yeah, on the inside, too. It says his airways are chock full of them.
this startin' to look a little witchy to you?
that was my first instinct, but I found zero signs of hexwork anywhere.
far as I can tell, witchcraft was not involved.
there's got to be some sort of link between, uh, skid mark and bubble wrap here.
no question. - All right, well, can I get a witness?
Yep.
officer Ed Colfax.
saw Hatch go from a solid to a liquid.
another cop? - Hatch's partner.
were you, uh...
were you racing me?
no.
I was kicking your ass. - Very mature.
Hello? Officer Colfax?
lookin' sharp, Kojak.
who the hell are you?
we're the Fed, Ed.
we're here to ask you a few follow-up questions about your partner's death.
don't worry about it. It's nobody's business.
officer Colfax - don't worry about it!
dude!
officer Colfax?
Hey, man, you all right? - Don't worry about it.
right.
look, Officer Colfax Ed.
we think that your partner died of unnatural causes.
did he have any enemies that you know of?
you might say that.
Oh, yeah?
who's that?
they both had it coming. Me too.
I'll be the next to go, and then it'll be over.
and God will be satisfied.
why does God want you all dead?
cause of Christopher Birch.
Oh, damn it.
who's Christopher Birch?
he has no face.
officer, you all right?
who is Christopher Birch, Ed?
christopher Birch is a kid with no face...
...and a planted gun.
uh, you, uh...
you got a little something...Yeah.
damn. My head's been itching like a dirty jock.
dead.
you hear that?
sweet. Blood, boils, locusts.
three of your more popular Egyptian plagues.
Yeah, but these guys...
ate their way out of a cop's melon.
I don't quite remember that in the King James.
meanwhile, a kid named Christopher Birch was shot in the head last month after a vehicle pursuit.
hatch, Gray, and Colfax were the three officers involved, and they all filed the exact same police report.
suspect exited vehicle brandishing a firearm. We were forced to fire.
just a kid with no face and a planted gun.
bunch of dicks.
so they pop the kid, plant the piece.
maybe Colfax is right.
you know, maybe heaven has a hate-on for bad cops.
so we're listening to the guy with the bug in his custard?
that's that's the, uh, the theory you want to go with?
Dean, angels got to have something to do, right, now that we're post-apocalypse?
Yeah, maybe.
we should call cass.
you're kidding, right?
Dean, I tried.
it was the first and second and third thing I did, soon as I got topside.
son of a bitch won't answer the phone.
well, let's give it a shot.
now I lay me down to sleep. I pray to Castiel to get his feathery ass down here.
you're an idiot. - Stay positive.
Oh, I am positive.
come on, Cass!
don't be a dick.
we got ourselves a...
Plague-like situation down here.
and...Do you...Do you copy?
like I said...
the son of a bitch doesn't answer
he's right behind me, isn't he?
hello.
hello.
Yes.
hello.
Hello"?
uh, that is still the term?
I spent all that time trying to get through to you.
Dean calls once, and now it's "Hello"?!
Yes.
so, what, you you like him better or something?
Dean and I do share a more profound bond.
I wasn't gonna mention it.
Cass, I think what he's trying to say is that...
he went to hell for us.
I mean, he really took one for the team. You remember that?
and then he comes back without a clue, and you can't take five friggin' minutes to give him some answers?
if I had any answers, I might have responded.
but I don't know, Sam.
we have no idea who brought you back from the cage...
or why.
So...It wasn't God?
no one's even seen God.
the whole thing remains mysterious.
what the hell does that mean?
what part of "I don't know" escapes your understanding?
Cass, look, if Sam calls, you answer.
okay? You wing your ass down here, and you tell him,"I don't know.
just because we have some sort of a - a bond or whatever...
you think I came because you called?
I came because of this.
Oh, well, it's nice to know what matters.
it does help one to focus.
wait, so so you and the Halo Patrol, you guys aren't the cause of these killings?
no.
but they were committed with one of our weapons.
there's only one thing that could have brought this into existence.
you call it the Staff of Moses.
the Staff?
it was used in a dominance display against the Egyptians, as I recall.
Yeah. That one made the papers.
b-but I thought The Staff turned, like, a-a river into blood not one dude.
the weapon isn't being used at full capacity.
I think we can rule Moses out as a suspect.
okay, but...What is what is Chuck Heston's disco stick doing down here, anyway?
I mean, don't you guys put away your toys?
before the apocalypse, heaven may have been corrupt, but it was stable.
the staff was safely contained.
it's been chaos up there since the war ended.
in that confusion, a number of...
powerful weapons were...Stolen.
wait, you you're saying your nukes are loose?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
but you've stumbled onto one of them.
we must find the weapon that did this.
I need your help.
that's rich. Really.
Sam, Dean, my "people skills" are "rusty.
pardon me, but I have spent the last "year
as a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent.
but believe me, you do not want that weapon down here.
help me find it.
or more people will die.
all right. Okay. Well, if the angels didn't pull the trigger, then that brings us back to motive.
what?
back to the case.
right now, we got three dead cops.
only thing linking them...
...is this.
father of slain suspect calls for investigation.
come on, dad. How many times are you gonna read that thing?
you know what? We should just throw it away.
go out back and play.
Oh, cass, a little warning next time. - What the...
how'd you get in here?! - Mr. Birch, settle down.
federal agents. - But you can't just walk in here!
quite a collection you've got there, huh?
what are you trying to - look, we know the truth, all right?
Chris didn't have a gun on him when those cops shot him.
they set him up. - Yeah.
they're all getting theirs.
and who's giving it to them, Darryl?
did you kill Toby Gray and the others? - Me?!
I didn't kill anyone! Look at how they died!
you smote them with the Staff of Moses!
the hell kind of Fed are you?
we don't have time for this.
where is it? - Leave my dad alone!
is that...? - Yes.
shouldn't it be bigger? - Yes. It's it's been sawed off.
leave him alone! It wasn't him! - Aaron, get out of here!
what did you do to him? - It's all right. He's just sleeping.
Cass, take it easy!
listen, we're not here to hurt you, okay?
but we need to know...
where did you get this thing?
please don't kill my dad.
it was me. I did it.
okay, nobody's killing anybody.
what's your name?
okay, Aaron Birch, where did you get this?
you won't believe me. - Try me.
it was an angel.
an angel?
those liars, they killed my brother, and nothing bad even happened to them.
it's not fair.
so I prayed to God every night he would punish them.
God didn't answer.
but he did.
his name did he give you a name?
no. He just said I could have justice, but I was gonna have to take it myself.
he...he gave me the stick.
he just... Gave it to you?
Ah, come on.
he didn't just give it to you, did he, Aaron?
I bought it.
you bought it?
with what?
what's your allowance?
what did the Angel want for it?
what did you give him for it?
my soul.
you sold your soul to an Angel?
can that even happen?
it's never happened before.
an Angel's buying souls.
that could explain why he cut the staff into pieces.
Why? - More pieces, more product.
more "product"? Who is this guy?
we'll find him.
what did you do that for? - Portability.
Cass, you realize you just kidnapped a kid?
if the Angel we seek truly bought this boy's soul, when a claim is laid on a living soul, it leaves a mark, a brand.
what, like a - like a shirt tag at camp?
I have no idea.
but I can read the mark and find the name of the angel that bought the soul.
how?
well, painfully for him.
the reading will be excruciating.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.
Dean. - He's a kid, Cass.
a ki - Sam?
Oh, well, yeah, then by all means, stick your arm right in there.
Dean! If I get the name, I can work a ritual to track the angel down.
and I'm all for that. But come on.
there's got to be another way. - There is no other way.
you're gonna torture a kid?
I can't care about that, Dean!
I don't have the luxury.
he'll rest now.
did you get a name? What is it?
I thought he died in the war.
what, he he was a he was a friend or something?
a good friend.
Yeah, well, your frat buddy is now moonlighting as a crossroads demon.
Balthazar. I wonder...
so we can find him now, right? - Balthazar.
Thanks, Castiel. We'll make good use of the name.
and by the way, Raphael says hello.
my car.
okay. Silver lining.
he's gone.
alright Cass, who was that guy? - A soldier of Raphael.
he must have followed me when I answered your call.
Raphael? The archangel?
I'm sorry, what's going on here?
I can explain later. Right now we have to no, not later. Now. Stop, all right?
too many angels, Cass! I don't know who's on first, what's on second.
what is "second"?! - Don't start that.
it is simple Raphael and his followers, they want him to rule heaven.
I and many others the last thing we want is to let him take over.
it would be catastrophic.
you're talking Civil War.
technically, yes.
which is why we have to find Balthazar and his weapons before Raphael does.
whoever has the weapons wins the war. - Help yourself.
and what happens if Raphael wins?
what what does he want? What he's always wanted to end the story the way it was written.
you mean the apocalypse, the one that we derailed?
Yes. That one.
Raphael wants to put it back on the rails.
Why?
I need myrrh.
myrrh?
friggin' Angels.
why does Raphael want to bring back all this crap?
he's a traditionalist.
Cass, why didn't you tell us this?
I was ashamed.
I expected more from my brothers.
I'm sorry.
now I need your blood.
whoa, whoa! Hey! Ahh! Why don't you use your own?
it wouldn't work. I'm not human.
uh, Cass, how long does this spell take?
got him. Let's go. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about him?
don't you think the police will take him home?
I was expecting more Dr. No, less Liberace.
you're here.
Balthazar. - It's so good to see you.
he told me you were floating around.
he?
Oh, you know, the old frog in the throat.
even i know that that's a bad joke.
I grieved your death. - Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry about that, you know.
I wanted them to think, you know, so...They wouldn't come looking for me.
What...is all this?
what are you doing? - Whatever I want.
you stole the Staff of Moses.
sure, sure.
I stole a lot of things.
you were a great and honorable soldier.
we fought together.
Yes, too many times to count.
I know you. You're not some common thief.
common? No.
thief? Eh.
I need your help. - I know.
I've been hearing all about you, and as far as I'm concerned, you and me, Cass...
nothing's changed.
we're brothers. Of course I want to help you.
thank you.
I need the weapons. - Don't ask that.
why take them? Why run away? - Because I could!
what? What? I me you're the one who made it possible.
the footsteps I'm following they're yours.
what you did, stopping the big plan, the prize fight?
you did more than rebel.
you tore up the whole script and burned the pages for all of us.
it's a new era.
no rules, no destiny. Just utter and complete freedom.
and this is what you do with it? - Hey, screw it, right?
I mean, dad's not coming back.
you might as well blow coke and jump on the bed.
you proved to me we could do anything, so I'm trying everything.
what difference does it make? - Of course it makes a diff - it's Civil War up there! - I know.
if we can beat Raphael, we can end this!
just give me the weapons.
do you know what's funny about you?
you actually believe that you can stop the fighting.
it will never stop.
my advice grab something valuable and fake your own death.
you've gone insane.
your little holiday is over.
Raphael knows you're alive by now.
Oh, Raphael can try me anytime.
I'm armed.
I'm sorry, Cass. All else aside, I'm really, really happy to see you.
even though you still have that stick up your ass.
was that you?
Oh, that's my cue then.
tell, uh, Raphael to bite me.
watch them. They're all snakes.
Hey, there.
Yeah, I got one of those, too.
you think you can knife fight an Angel?
who's fighting? Peace out, douchewad.
you're making a mistake.
please. There is another way.
brother, please. I don't want to hurt you.
why won't any of you listen?
they don't listen, Castiel, because their hearts are mine.
somehow, I don't think God will be bringing you back this time.
Hey!
look at my junk.
no.
same thing happened to Lot's wife.
iodize the poor sucker, and your kitchen is stocked for life.
you came back.
well, now Raphael will have to go shopping for a new vessel.
should give me a nice long head start on him.
until next time.
next time.
no time like the present.
holy fire.
you hairless ape! Release me!
first you're taking your marker off of Aaron Birch's soul!
am I?! - Sam?!
unless you like your wings extra crispy,
I'd think about it.
Castiel, I stood for you in heaven.
are you gonna let - Castiel: I believe...
the hairless ape has the floor.
very well.
the boy's debt is cleared. His soul is his own.
why you buying up human souls, anyway?
in this economy?
it's probably the only thing worth buying.
do you have any idea what souls are worth?
what power they hold?
Now...Release me.
suck it, ass clown. Nobody said anything
Cass, what the hell?
my debt to you is cleared.
fair enough.
Cass, are you out of your mind?!
Oh, friggin' Angels! Come on!
Yeah, well I didn't realize I had this much stuff back here.
well, I need some space.
kind of picked up some stuff along the way.
what the hell is that?
Oh, it's, uh, Ben's Halloween costume.
wendigo? - Yeah.
accurate.
Hey, so, uh...
...are you okay?
me?
Yeah, I'm great.
Really? 'Cause there's been a few times that you got me wondering.
come again?
well, like where were you when Cass was, uh, giving the Holy taser treatment to that kid?
I was right there. - Really?
cause honestly, I felt like I was the only one raising a card.
right. Uh, I mean, I was with you, but...
I don't know. W-we needed the intel.
Yeah, I know, but we tortured that kid to get it.
I just didn't get the feeling that you
that you even cared.
you're wrong.
man, I'm just trying to figure this out because...
something's different with you.
you know that. - Yeah. Yeah, I know.
Really? - Yeah. I mean...
I've been hunting nonstop for the past year, kind of...Kind of out in the wild, you know?
so, yeah, I suppose I'm a little rough around the edges.
Yeah, I get that.
I just don't think I'm getting the whole scoop.
you went to hell, Sam.
and believe me, I know what that does to a guy.
to you. - What?
you know what it does to you.
it it tortured you. You know?
I think it still does.
but, Dean...
I'm okay.
so you're saying, what, that that you're stronger than me?
no. Just saying we're different.
soon
monsters lately.
is it me or is it weird?
look out!
vampires?
these aren't vampires, man. These...
these are douche bags.
explain to me what's going on out there.
lis, I can't bring this crap home to you.
you're talking about your work. - I'm talking about my life.
anyone in town who asks aloud for the truth invokes veritas.
and she doesn't just give it to you. She slams you with it.
whoa, why the hell am I telling you this? - Because I'm cursed.
I'm saying I asked for the truth, and, uh, guess what? I'm getting it.
so, like I said, I have a few questions for you.
Dean, you all right?
it's Sam, Bobby.
you got my back.
no matter what happens, I can always count on you, right, Sammy?
then
Hey, Dean.
how long you been back? - About a year.
what have you been doing? - Hunting.
you been back practically this whole time?! -You finally had what you wanted, Dean.
I wanted my brother, alive.
you wanted a family.
you only gave it up because of the way we lived.
but you had something, and you were building something.
I need you to go. You're a hunter.
and now you know your brother's out there. Things are different.
you don't want to be here, Dean. - Yes, I do.
me and Ben will be here, and...
and you really think we could pull something like that off?
it's worth a shot.
archangels are fierce.
they're absolute.
they're heaven's most terrifying weapon.
Raphael.
come and get me, you little bastard.
when the oil burns, no angel can touch or pass through the flames, or he dies.
I'm warning you. Do not leave me here.
I will find you.
what are you gonna do now?
return to heaven, I suppose. - Heaven?
with Michael in the cage, I'm sure it's total anarchy up there.
now
Oh, come on.
what the hell?
come on, man. Let's get going.
ed, I think I'm bleeding.
the THIRD MAN
Hey, you.
Hey.
don't stop on my account.
I'm done.
last night was a...
high point, if you don't mind me saying.
good.
all right.
well, I see you need to start your day.
when did you say you were heading out?
you didn't. Right.
damn, you know how to play that mystery card.
right.
I almost forgot.
next time...You can call me on my night off.
if you want.
okay.
okay.
Hey. - Hey.
I'm about eight hours out of the Campbell Base.
uh, change of plans.
I need you to meet me. I'm in P. A. Town called Easter.
what are you doing in Pennsylvania?
caught a case.
a case?
when? It's been like a day and a half.
I like to work. - Apparently.
glad we hashed that out.
call me when you roll into town.
who died and made you boss?
Oh, you could do better than that.
why are you calling me?
he's dead, right? That's it.
now, I don't want to talk about it.
we do what we do
we go to work, we go to the funeral.
calm down.
this is nothing to do with you and me.
you're just working yourself up. Don't call me.
idiot.
God!
God!
dispatch, this is
please, I -- I need...
please.
Ben...I know you're lying.
because I lie professionally, that's how.
now tell your mom that you broke the damn thing and take it like a man.
okay? Ok okay.
Wow. - What?
you molding the minds of tomorrow. Who knew?
Yeah, tell me about it.
how'd it go? - With?
you and Lisa. How'd she take it when you bailed?
shockingly cool, actually.
better for everybody.
Yeah, I suppose.
still driving the plastic piece of crap, huh?
what's your mileage, again? - Shut up.
740 lincoln ave police department
officer Gerald Hatch 17-year veteran, found dead in the ready room three days ago.
somebody was over-hydrated.
basically, yeah. The guy just... Liquefied.
most of the meat, bones, dense tissues
they just turned to blood.
okay, I don't get it. - Nobody gets it.
no. I mean, I get that.
I'm saying, if the guy was a mop job, then what are we doing in the morgue?
what's left of him to look at?
not here to look at him.
here.
Ooh. Bad news.
officer Toby Gray.
they brought him in yesterday.
found him dead in his patrol car, sitting at a speed trap on the outside of town.
extreme allergic reaction.
Yeah. Boils. Covered from head to toe.
Yeah, on the inside, too. It says his airways are chock full of them.
this startin' to look a little witchy to you?
that was my first instinct, but I found zero signs of hexwork anywhere.
far as I can tell, witchcraft was not involved.
there's got to be some sort of link between, uh, skid mark and bubble wrap here.
no question. - All right, well, can I get a witness?
Yep.
officer Ed Colfax.
saw Hatch go from a solid to a liquid.
another cop? - Hatch's partner.
were you, uh...
were you racing me?
no.
I was kicking your ass. - Very mature.
Hello? Officer Colfax?
lookin' sharp, Kojak.
who the hell are you?
we're the Fed, Ed.
we're here to ask you a few follow-up questions about your partner's death.
don't worry about it. It's nobody's business.
officer Colfax - don't worry about it!
dude!
officer Colfax?
Hey, man, you all right? - Don't worry about it.
right.
look, Officer Colfax Ed.
we think that your partner died of unnatural causes.
did he have any enemies that you know of?
you might say that.
Oh, yeah?
who's that?
they both had it coming. Me too.
I'll be the next to go, and then it'll be over.
and God will be satisfied.
why does God want you all dead?
cause of Christopher Birch.
Oh, damn it.
who's Christopher Birch?
he has no face.
officer, you all right?
who is Christopher Birch, Ed?
christopher Birch is a kid with no face...
...and a planted gun.
uh, you, uh...
you got a little something...Yeah.
damn. My head's been itching like a dirty jock.
dead.
you hear that?
sweet. Blood, boils, locusts.
three of your more popular Egyptian plagues.
Yeah, but these guys...
ate their way out of a cop's melon.
I don't quite remember that in the King James.
meanwhile, a kid named Christopher Birch was shot in the head last month after a vehicle pursuit.
hatch, Gray, and Colfax were the three officers involved, and they all filed the exact same police report.
suspect exited vehicle brandishing a firearm. We were forced to fire.
just a kid with no face and a planted gun.
bunch of dicks.
so they pop the kid, plant the piece.
maybe Colfax is right.
you know, maybe heaven has a hate-on for bad cops.
so we're listening to the guy with the bug in his custard?
that's that's the, uh, the theory you want to go with?
Dean, angels got to have something to do, right, now that we're post-apocalypse?
Yeah, maybe.
we should call cass.
you're kidding, right?
Dean, I tried.
it was the first and second and third thing I did, soon as I got topside.
son of a bitch won't answer the phone.
well, let's give it a shot.
now I lay me down to sleep. I pray to Castiel to get his feathery ass down here.
you're an idiot. - Stay positive.
Oh, I am positive.
come on, Cass!
don't be a dick.
we got ourselves a...
Plague-like situation down here.
and...Do you...Do you copy?
like I said...
the son of a bitch doesn't answer
he's right behind me, isn't he?
hello.
hello.
Yes.
hello.
Hello"?
uh, that is still the term?
I spent all that time trying to get through to you.
Dean calls once, and now it's "Hello"?!
Yes.
so, what, you you like him better or something?
Dean and I do share a more profound bond.
I wasn't gonna mention it.
Cass, I think what he's trying to say is that...
he went to hell for us.
I mean, he really took one for the team. You remember that?
and then he comes back without a clue, and you can't take five friggin' minutes to give him some answers?
if I had any answers, I might have responded.
but I don't know, Sam.
we have no idea who brought you back from the cage...
or why.
So...It wasn't God?
no one's even seen God.
the whole thing remains mysterious.
what the hell does that mean?
what part of "I don't know" escapes your understanding?
Cass, look, if Sam calls, you answer.
okay? You wing your ass down here, and you tell him,"I don't know.
just because we have some sort of a - a bond or whatever...
you think I came because you called?
I came because of this.
Oh, well, it's nice to know what matters.
it does help one to focus.
wait, so so you and the Halo Patrol, you guys aren't the cause of these killings?
no.
but they were committed with one of our weapons.
there's only one thing that could have brought this into existence.
you call it the Staff of Moses.
the Staff?
it was used in a dominance display against the Egyptians, as I recall.
Yeah. That one made the papers.
b-but I thought The Staff turned, like, a-a river into blood not one dude.
the weapon isn't being used at full capacity.
I think we can rule Moses out as a suspect.
okay, but...What is what is Chuck Heston's disco stick doing down here, anyway?
I mean, don't you guys put away your toys?
before the apocalypse, heaven may have been corrupt, but it was stable.
the staff was safely contained.
it's been chaos up there since the war ended.
in that confusion, a number of...
powerful weapons were...Stolen.
wait, you you're saying your nukes are loose?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
but you've stumbled onto one of them.
we must find the weapon that did this.
I need your help.
that's rich. Really.
Sam, Dean, my "people skills" are "rusty.
pardon me, but I have spent the last "year
as a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent.
but believe me, you do not want that weapon down here.
help me find it.
or more people will die.
all right. Okay. Well, if the angels didn't pull the trigger, then that brings us back to motive.
what?
back to the case.
right now, we got three dead cops.
only thing linking them...
...is this.
father of slain suspect calls for investigation.
come on, dad. How many times are you gonna read that thing?
you know what? We should just throw it away.
go out back and play.
Oh, cass, a little warning next time. - What the...
how'd you get in here?! - Mr. Birch, settle down.
federal agents. - But you can't just walk in here!
quite a collection you've got there, huh?
what are you trying to - look, we know the truth, all right?
Chris didn't have a gun on him when those cops shot him.
they set him up. - Yeah.
they're all getting theirs.
and who's giving it to them, Darryl?
did you kill Toby Gray and the others? - Me?!
I didn't kill anyone! Look at how they died!
you smote them with the Staff of Moses!
the hell kind of Fed are you?
we don't have time for this.
where is it? - Leave my dad alone!
is that...? - Yes.
shouldn't it be bigger? - Yes. It's it's been sawed off.
leave him alone! It wasn't him! - Aaron, get out of here!
what did you do to him? - It's all right. He's just sleeping.
Cass, take it easy!
listen, we're not here to hurt you, okay?
but we need to know...
where did you get this thing?
please don't kill my dad.
it was me. I did it.
okay, nobody's killing anybody.
what's your name?
okay, Aaron Birch, where did you get this?
you won't believe me. - Try me.
it was an angel.
an angel?
those liars, they killed my brother, and nothing bad even happened to them.
it's not fair.
so I prayed to God every night he would punish them.
God didn't answer.
but he did.
his name did he give you a name?
no. He just said I could have justice, but I was gonna have to take it myself.
he...he gave me the stick.
he just... Gave it to you?
Ah, come on.
he didn't just give it to you, did he, Aaron?
I bought it.
you bought it?
with what?
what's your allowance?
what did the Angel want for it?
what did you give him for it?
my soul.
you sold your soul to an Angel?
can that even happen?
it's never happened before.
an Angel's buying souls.
that could explain why he cut the staff into pieces.
Why? - More pieces, more product.
more "product"? Who is this guy?
we'll find him.
what did you do that for? - Portability.
Cass, you realize you just kidnapped a kid?
if the Angel we seek truly bought this boy's soul, when a claim is laid on a living soul, it leaves a mark, a brand.
what, like a - like a shirt tag at camp?
I have no idea.
but I can read the mark and find the name of the angel that bought the soul.
how?
well, painfully for him.
the reading will be excruciating.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.
Dean. - He's a kid, Cass.
a ki - Sam?
Oh, well, yeah, then by all means, stick your arm right in there.
Dean! If I get the name, I can work a ritual to track the angel down.
and I'm all for that. But come on.
there's got to be another way. - There is no other way.
you're gonna torture a kid?
I can't care about that, Dean!
I don't have the luxury.
he'll rest now.
did you get a name? What is it?
I thought he died in the war.
what, he he was a he was a friend or something?
a good friend.
Yeah, well, your frat buddy is now moonlighting as a crossroads demon.
Balthazar. I wonder...
so we can find him now, right? - Balthazar.
Thanks, Castiel. We'll make good use of the name.
and by the way, Raphael says hello.
my car.
okay. Silver lining.
he's gone.
alright Cass, who was that guy? - A soldier of Raphael.
he must have followed me when I answered your call.
Raphael? The archangel?
I'm sorry, what's going on here?
I can explain later. Right now we have to no, not later. Now. Stop, all right?
too many angels, Cass! I don't know who's on first, what's on second.
what is "second"?! - Don't start that.
it is simple Raphael and his followers, they want him to rule heaven.
I and many others the last thing we want is to let him take over.
it would be catastrophic.
you're talking Civil War.
technically, yes.
which is why we have to find Balthazar and his weapons before Raphael does.
whoever has the weapons wins the war. - Help yourself.
and what happens if Raphael wins?
what what does he want? What he's always wanted to end the story the way it was written.
you mean the apocalypse, the one that we derailed?
Yes. That one.
Raphael wants to put it back on the rails.
Why?
I need myrrh.
myrrh?
friggin' Angels.
why does Raphael want to bring back all this crap?
he's a traditionalist.
Cass, why didn't you tell us this?
I was ashamed.
I expected more from my brothers.
I'm sorry.
now I need your blood.
whoa, whoa! Hey! Ahh! Why don't you use your own?
it wouldn't work. I'm not human.
uh, Cass, how long does this spell take?
got him. Let's go. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about him?
don't you think the police will take him home?
I was expecting more Dr. No, less Liberace.
you're here.
Balthazar. - It's so good to see you.
he told me you were floating around.
he?
Oh, you know, the old frog in the throat.
even i know that that's a bad joke.
I grieved your death. - Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry about that, you know.
I wanted them to think, you know, so...They wouldn't come looking for me.
What...is all this?
what are you doing? - Whatever I want.
you stole the Staff of Moses.
sure, sure.
I stole a lot of things.
you were a great and honorable soldier.
we fought together.

why take them? Why run away? - Because I could!
what? What? I me you're the one who made it possible.
the footsteps I'm following they're yours.
what you did, stopping the big plan, the prize fight?
you did more than rebel.
you tore up the whole script and burned the pages for all of us.
it's a new era.
no rules, no destiny. Just utter and complete freedom.
and this is what you do with it? - Hey, screw it, right?
I mean, dad's not coming back.
you might as well blow coke and jump on the bed.
you proved to me we could do anything, so I'm trying everything.
what difference does it make? - Of course it makes a diff - it's Civil War up there! - I know.
if we can beat Raphael, we can end this!
just give me the weapons.
do you know what's funny about you?

you went to hell, Sam.
and believe me, I know what that does to a guy.
to you. - What?
you know what it does to you.

no matter what happens, I can always count on you, right, Sammy?
then - You're sure it's vampires? - Definitely.
their alpha's building an army.
we don't scare them anymore.
I'm your grandfather.
we all thought you were dead.
we're guessing whatever pulled Sam up pulled me down.
so, whatever this is, we're both a part of it.
but you don't know what that is.
Dean, you all right? - It's Sam, bobby.
he's just -- he's different. Something's not right to me.
what is wrong with him?
I don't know, Dean. I'm sorry.
almost like you let him get turned.
get a man on the inside,
help us find that alpha vamp we've been looking for?
you think I'd do something like that, risk my own brother?
you got my back.
no matter what happens, I can always count on you, Right, Sammy?
Yeah. Of course, Dean.
what are you? You're not human.
please, just let me explain.
why the hell should I believe anything you say?
there's something wrong with me, really wrong.
I need help.
now
you're right. He looks terrible.
you did this?
what's -- let me go.
has he been feverish? - Have you?
no. Why?
is he speaking in tongues?
are you speaking in tongues?
no. What are you...
are you diagnosing me?
you better hope he can. - You really think that this is
what, you think that there's a clinic out there
for people who just pop out of hell? Wrong.
he asks, you answer!
then you shut your hole. You got it?
how much do you sleep?
I don't.
at all?
not since I got back.
and it never occurred to you That there might be something off about that?!
of course it did, Dean.
I-I just never told you.
what? - Sam...
what are you feeling now?
I feel like my nose is broken.
no, that's a physical sensation. How do you feel?
well, I think -- - feel.
I...Don't know.
what? Uh...
this will be unpleasant. - What
bite down on this.
if there's someplace that you find soothing,
you should go there.
in your mind.
did you find anything?
no.
so that's good news?
I'm afraid not.
physically, he's perfectly healthy.
then what?
it's his soul.
it's gone.
I'm s-- I'm sorry. One more time, like I'm 5.
what do you mean, he's got no
somehow, when Sam was resurrected,
it was without his soul.
so, where is it?
my guess is...
still in the cage with Michael and Lucifer.
so, is he even still Sam?
well, you pose an interesting philosophical question.
well, then, just get it back.
Dean. - Well, you pulled me out.
it took several angels to rescue you,
and you weren't nearly as well guarded.
Sam's soul is in Lucifer's cage.
there's a difference, a big difference.
it's not possible. - Okay, well, there's got to be a way.
so, are you gonna untie me? - No.
listen, I'm not gonna -- - Sam, how the hell Am I even supposed to let you out of this room?
Dean, I'm not some psycho.
I didn't want you to get hurt.
I was just trying to stop the vamps.
I'm sorry.
it won't ever happen again.
please let me go.
you're kidding, right?
well, what are you gonna do, just keep me locked up in here forever?
you say that like it's a bad thing.
okay, fine, look, I get it. I get it, Dean. I was wrong.
but I'm telling you I-I'm trying to get right.
it's still me.
is it? - Yes.
so just let me go.
no way in hell.
I didn't want it to come to this.
you're not gonna hold me, Dean
not here, not in a panic room, not anywhere.
you're stuck with the soulless guy,
so you might as well work with me.
let's fix this.
I'm gonna be watching every move you make.
fine.
sounds about right to me.
Cass, clean him up.
all right, if we're gonna figure out what happened to your soul,
then we need to find who yanked you out.
you say you don't know?
no idea. - Then we start a list.
if it's so hard to spring someone out of the box,
then who's got that kind of muscle?
I don't know.
you have no memory of your resurrection?
I woke up in a field. That's all I got.
no clues? None?
I've got one.
gramps throw a barbecue, leave us off the e-vite list?
Dean. - Hello, Newman.
Where's the man?
come right on in.
need to ask you a few questions.
what's wrong?
the day you got back, what happened?
we've been over this.
well, recap it for our wingman.
this Castiel?
you're scrawnier than I pictured.
this is a vessel.
my true form is approximately The size of your Chrysler building.
all right, all right, quit bragging.
so, you were dead, and...
and, pow, I was on Elton ridge.
don't know how. Don't know why.
I got nothing to hide, guys.
well, you mind if Cass here double-checks?
whoa, whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay.
it's okay. - What the hell?
angel cavity search.
I'm fine, Christian. Just give us a minute.
but -- - Just give us a minute.
what the hell was that about?
his soul is intact.
what?
of course I have a
what's going on, Sam?
whatever dragged me out...
left a piece behind.
did you know? - No, but I...
I knew it was something. I...
you're a hell of a hunter, Sam, but...
the truth is, sometimes you scare me.
so, what's the deal here? How do we fix this?
how do we get his soul back?
we don't know yet, but we have to.
well, I'm here to help, of course.
what leads you working? - A bunch of dead ends and you.
well, then, we'll just have to dig.
I have to get back.
you're leaving?
I'm in the middle of a civil war.
you better tear the attic up, find something to help Sam.
of course. Your problems always come first.
I'll be in touch.
would've asked him to stick around for a beer.
so, what's with the book club outside?
putting together a hunt.
that's a lot of guys for one hunt.
you found him, didn't you?
who? - He's got a lead on the alpha vamp.
do you?
maybe.
Yeah.
how'd you track him down?
we're good.
that's all i get? "We're good"?
when's the run?
dawn.
you didn't call me? Why?
cause of me.
you don't trust me very much, do you?
especially when it comes to big game like this.
that's not true.
okay, well, then, we're in.
no offense, but
so you don't trust me.
no, i just don't know you.
not like i know sam.
all right.
you call the plays.
100%. I'm here to listen.
since when?
big daddy bloodsucker?
I ain't gonna miss that.
but this is your deal. Okay? I get it.
I'll follow your lead. I trust you.
I don't trust him.
dude's hiding something.
what? - I can feel it.
and if you weren't robo-Sam, you'd feel it, too.
huh. - What?
Just...you.
saying you don't trust family.
look, we hang close, we blend in, we see what we can pick up.
you think samuel's connected to this whole soul thing?
I still think he's the only lead we got.
you lost, dean?
had to make a phone call. Just needed some privacy.
Oh.
samuel's locked office is pretty private.
wasn't locked.
who you calling?
your wife. Let her know i'm not gonna make it over tonight.
you know, i've tried playing nice, dean, But i think i'm done.
wait, are you trying to tell me That you're a bigger knob than you've been letting on?
I'm the guy who's been here, doing my job.
who are you? You think we need you here?
you walk around like you're playing pro tennis.
only action you seen lately Is between your slut girlfriend's legs.
you sure you want to come with us tomorrow?
accidents happen.
don't worry, man.
I got your back.
the house is just over the hill.
about a dozen vamps and the alpha.
we got one shot at this son of a bitch.
Christian, take flank.
the rest of you are with me and sam.
Dean, gwen...
hang back, sweep any stragglers we flush out.
problem, dean?
no, sir. - I'm in the rear with the reject?
all right, let's go.
don't worry. It's fine.
no, nothing's fine. You're not fine.
go. Go.
sorry about the "reject" thing.
Ah, i've been called worse.
just, uh, get sick of getting left behind.
think it's probably 'cause i remind him Of his daughter or something.
well, you just speak your mind.
I'll take that as a compliment.
you should.
you're welcome.
we're supposed to wait here!
careful, now! - yeah. Got him.
??? Get in.
where were you?
everything all right here?
just, uh, chopped up a runner. No big deal.
how'd it go?
rough, but one alpha down.
where is it?
want to pay my last respects.
well, bring marshmallows. Already on the pyre.
things go okay back there?
fine.
nothing weird?
I saw you walk that alpha out the door, sam.
now, call me crazy...
but that seems weird.
Oh.
Oh.
you weren't supposed to know about that.
know what? - It's just something samuel's been doing.
catching things, taking them somewhere,
grilling them for info.
grill. Torture, right?
and not telling me -- That was his idea?
no, it was mine.
Why?
honestly?
cause you'd mess it up.
you shoot first, ask questions later, And we needed to ask questions.
you know, i-I don't care if you've got soullessness
or the freakin' mumps, man -- You know better than this!
do you even want your soul back?
how does that have anything to do
have you been to the place where samuel takes them?
I mean, have you been in on these interrogations?
no, but i hear
and what does he want? And why?
and did it ever occur to you that this is really shady?
he's our grandfather. - Yeah.
Yeah, a guy who talks a great game.
but you can't assume that family means The same thing to him as it does to us.
he's not dad.
Wow.
you don't see it, do you? - What?
you've got no instinct.
I mean, you are seriously messed up.
Thanks. I'm not kidding, man.
nobody's forcing you to work with me, okay? But if we do this...
I drive the bus, I call the shots,
and you tell me everything, Whether you think it's important or not,
because -- trust me -- you can't tell the difference.
or, you know what, go -- go with Samuel.
see how that goes.
it's up to you.
damn, kid. Learn how to knock.
Where's your brother?
gone. - What do you mean, "gone"?
I mean he left about an hour ago.
he and I just weren't seeing eye-to-eye anymore I guess.
that's too bad.
I want in.
in?
on the interrogations, on everything.
I can help.
this family -- this is it for me now.
whatever you need, I'll do.
Yeah, I know you will. - Great.
but until we can figure out this soul business of yours,
I need you to keep doing what you're doing.
but I can -- - No. You can't.
I'm sorry.
right.
Hey.
you didn't think I'd come back.
I figured 6040.
so, Samuel didn't take the bait.
so I went with plan "b.
we had a plan "b"?
fired up the GPS on one of his cellphones.
we should be able to track him right to the alpha.
the old man won't notice? - Trust me.
he thinks velcro is big news.
there. Got him.
dead man's blood?
smart.
lock the place down with vamp repellent.
where is it?
answer the question. Where is it? How do we find it?
Ouch. Stop. That hurts.
this
this is club med compared to what we have planned for you.
I got -- I got all the time in the world.
well, that makes two of us.
are you two going to hide all night?
come on out, boys.
how can I help you?
we got some questions for you, skippy,
since you're going nowhere fast.
don't be so sure. - Yeah?
locked down pretty tight.
and with all that dead blood rushing through your veins,
not sure you got enough juice To fire up that psychic bat-signal of yours, do you?
true.
not near enough juice for that...
I didn't realize we were on a first-name basis.
of course we are.
after all, you were my child...
for a time.
Dean, tell me...
did you enjoy it?
I'm asking the questions here, fright night.
when your kind first huddled around the fire,
I was the thing in the dark!
now you think you can hurt me?
I have all night, boys. You do not.
anyway, I'm happy to tell you whatever you want to know.
Why? - why?
because soon, I'll be ankle-deep in your blood,
sucking the marrow from your bones.
so you're really it.
the first of your species.
the very first.
but if you're the first...
who made you?
we all have our mothers.
even me.
what does that mean?
and what's with the big surge of vamps lately? I mean, it's like
like we're going to war.
Why? What's going on? Why did Samuel bring you here?
you smell cold.
you have no soul.
what an oddity.
do you feel how empty you are?
what is it like to have no soul?
answer my question. - You first.
you're the one in the cage.
the thing about souls -- If you've got one, of course
is they're predictable.
you die, you go up or down.
where do my kind go?
all right, enough with the sermon, freak.
I'm trying to answer the question.
now, when we "freaks" die...
where do we go?
not heaven, not hell.
so?
Legoland?
little rusty on our dante, boys?
purgatory.
purgatory? Purgatory's real?
stupid cattle.
of course!
and it is filled with the soul of every hungry thing like me
that ever walked this earth.
now, where is it? That is the mystery.
and that is what your kindhearted granddaddy
is trying to beat out of me.
samuel brought you here...
to find out where purgatory is?
I keep telling him -- how would I know such a thing?
but he refuses to untie me.
you know exactly where it is.
why does Samuel care about any of this?
he doesn't care.
he does as he is told.
well, if the old man's kermit...
whose hand's up his ass?
evening, guys.
wow, you know, I have seen some stupid in my time,
but you take the crown.
putting jaws in a fishbowl?
how do you think that's gonna end?
I don't know what kind of game you're running
what, do you think I'm doing this for kicks?
I think you got the rest of these feebs convinced that you're john Wayne.
so whatever you're doing, whatever you're hiding...
it's gonna put you and everyone around you in the ground.
Hi.
and I thought we had something special.
are you scared of me?
I would be.
go ahead.
grab your stuff.
???
how long till the alpha's 100%?
hour. Maybe less.
we need to get him dosed up and back in the cage.
no.
what do you mean, "no"? - I mean, I don't know what your big plan was, - But playing catch is not on the table. - Dean
we take the thing's head off, or it kills us all!
you know that.
okay.
we split up. Clear every room.
you get a shot, you take it.
it's not gonna kill him, but dude will move a lot slower without any kneecaps.
and if we make it through this, you, me, and Sam
are having one hell of a family meeting.
you think he ran out?
No!
the boy with no soul.
I've got big plans for you.
it's amazing how that pesky, little soul gets in the way.
but not for you.
you will be the perfect...
animal.
well, that was dramatic.
Hello, boys.
what an unexpected treat.
bring Christian back now.
I'm sorry?
my nephew! The one you just crammed a demon into!
Oh. No. I had him possessed ages ago.
samuel, really.
I keep an eye on my investments.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. You two know each other?
not in the biblical sense.
more of a business relationship, I'd say.
you're Crowley's bitch.
it's not what you think.
it's precisely what you think.
that alpha he's caught me is getting him a gold star.
since when do you give a crap about vampires?
since, uh...
what's today -- Friday?
since, let's see -- mind your business.
you may as well share with the class, Crowley.
we know you're looking for purgatory.
so you heard about that?
Yeah. You want to tell us why?
isn't it obvious?
location, location, location.
I'm a developer.
purgatory is vast, Underutilized, and hell-adjacent, - And I want it. - What for?
best shut your gob.
employees don't question management.
we ain't your employees. - Of course you are!
have been for some time now, thanks to gramps.
I don't keep captain chromedome around for his wit, do I?
samuel knows things.
more than any of you, actually.
walking encyclopedia of the creepy and the crawly.
and I knew...
you two are so hung up on family-loyalty nonsense,
he said jump, you'd get froggy.
Yeah, well, the game's over.
Yeah, well, afraid not,
not if you want to see Sam's soul ever again.
you're bluffing.
tell them, Samuel.
he pulled us both back, me and Sam.
what? You knew?
no, Cass says it takes big-time mojo To pull something like that off,
and you're nothing but a punk-ass crossroads demon.
was a punk-ass crossroads demon.
now? King of hell.
believe me, I've got the mojo.
I snap my fingers, Sam gets his soul back.
or you can be...You,
and I shove Sam right back in the hole.
can't imagine what it's like in there...
and I can imagine so many things.
so, we clear?
me, Charlie... You, angels.
job's simple enough -- bring me creatures.
aim high on the food chain, please.
everybody wins.
it's been a pleasure. See you soon.
??
you're letting a demon call the shots?
nothing's changed.
we hunt. Period.
don't worry about him. I'll take care of it.
you trust me or not?
get the van, Gwen.
working with a demon, huh?
you're not who I thought you were.
you don't know anything about me, son.
so, what's so important
that you're the king of hell's cabana boy, huh?
What'd he offer you? Girls? Money? Hair?
I got my reasons.
you gonna make a move, go ahead.
or what? - Or nothing.
I'm not gonna do anything to you, Dean.
you boys...
...you're my family.
so the way I see it, you got two choices
put a bullet in your grandfather or step aside.
he sold us out.
I know.
let it go.
Why?
get out of here.
so, what now?
we can't work for Crowley. - Are you sure about that?
I don't think you understand. Demons bone you every time.
Oh, no, I get it. I do, believe me.
just running the math -- Do we really have another choice?
we could stab him in his throat.
and get my soul back how?
I'm just saying, seems like we got to play ball,
at least for the moment.
I have done some stupid things in my time,
but punching a demon's clock?
look, just till we find another way.
and then?
and then we track Crowley down
and give that son of a bitch what's coming to him.
you with me, Dean?
a freak animal killing machine by moonlight.
I mean, werewolves are badass.
we already know how to bring these suckers down.
one of these bad boys right to the heart.
there's something wrong with me, really wrong. I need help.
how much do you sleep? - I don't.
at all? - It's his soul. It's gone.
so, where is it?
still in the cage with michael and lucifer.
what the hell was that thing?
it may have been an alpha. - An alpha? Like
the first one who spawned all the others. There's tons of lore about it.
bring me creatures.
aim high on the food chain, please.
we ain't your employees. - Of course you are!
you're nothing but a punk-Ass crossroads demon.
was a punk-Ass crossroads demon.
now? King of hell.
I snap my fingers, Sam gets his soul back.
or I shove Sam right back in the hole.
did he eat?
you gave him a bath, right?
well, did you take him to the park?
and did he make pee-Pee and poo-Poo?
good. Tell him daddy loves him.
be home soon.
what the...
I know, bobby, but there's got to be another way.
I don't know. Keep digging.
I mean, if crowley thinks we're just gonna
Crowley thinks you're just gonna what, Dean?
is that bobby singer?
give him a kiss for me.
I'll call you back.
good news, boys!
I've got a job for you.
I'm gonna say this once.
you can take your job and shove it up your ass.
is that any way to talk to your boss?
you're not my boss, dickbag.
Dean, Dean. Been through this. Quit clutching your pearls.
you've been working for me for some time now. Sam here, longer.
we didn't know.
like that makes a difference to you.
you'd sell your brother for a dollar right now if you really needed a soda.
look, I'm sending you -- - No.
beg pardon?
I've done some shady stuff in my time,
but I am not doing this.
no.
10 quid says you will.
you like pain, Sam? You like hell?
you need to stop thinking of this as some kind of deal.
this is a hostage situation, you arrogant little thug.
I own your brother! Do you understand me?
come on, Dean, smile.
it's not that bad.
here's incentive
you bag me a live alpha,
and I'll give you little Sammy's soul back, with a cherry on top.
what, alpha vamp not good enough for you?
best mind where you poke your nose,
if you want to keep it.
your merry little hike up the food chain starts here.
businessman found dead in his car
chest ripped open, heart missing.
sounds like? - Werewolf.
no, it's not a full moon.
werewolves turning on the full moon -- So '09.
he's right.
samuel and I ganked one about six months back on the half-Moon.
things have been out of whack for a while now, I guess.
Yeah, I guess.
so, it's settled then.
you bag the howler, bring it home to papa.
see you soon, boys.
so, the vic's a real class act.
owned a bunch of slum-Grade apartments.
couple houses, too.
so this is it? This is -- This is what you're gonna do?
what am I doing?
he's so far up our asses we're -- We're -- We're coughing sulfur,
but you -- You're just gonna work the case?
well, he's got us by the short and curlies.
what else are we supposed to do?
it's just -- You know, man, I...
I'm working for a demon now.
I don't even know who you are. I just...
I just need a second to adjust.
Look...this is a crap situation.
I get it.
but, Dean, I am still me
same melon, same memories.
I-I still like the same music.
I still think about suzie heizer.
biology class suzie heizer?
can you blame me?
look, I know you don't trust me.
??? And I did.
but I'm going to prove it to you.
I'm still your brother.
how you doing? Agents holt and wilson.
feds? - Yeah.
what are the feds doing here?
Oh, we're specialists.
they call us in to answer the questions of mouth-Breathing dick monkeys.
so, you gonna walk us through this, or, uh...
dock worker. Guy on the morning shift found him
chest ripped wide open.
same as the body in the car?
Yeah, ???
internal organs missing on both vics?
like their hearts?
looks like it, yeah.
how'd you know?
so, this guy, he -- He have any enemies?
Yeah, plenty, but, uh,
I don't think it was a wolf or possibly a cougar that had a beef with the guy.
you do realize these were animal attacks?
an animal out here.
what, you think it came for the sailing?
morning.
you didn't sleep.
cause you don't...sleep.
right.
Yeah. That's not creepy at all.
not like I can help it.
so, you gonna just lay there staring at me, or you want to hear what I dug up?
all right.
so, we know that werewolves are basically id gone wild, right?
I mean, whoever they hate, they kill when they wolf out.
so, I've been playing connect the victims.
And?
and I think I found a common denominator.
so come on. Uh...
get the lead out, huh?
let me get dressed, robocop.
Yes, can I help you?
is cal garrigan at home?
we've got a few questions we'd like to ask him.
Yeah. Um, come in.
Oh, god.
honey,
why don't you go play in your room for a little while, okay?
Yeah. - Okay.
excuse the mess.
please sit.
can I get you guys anything?
no, thank you.
so cal is your boyfriend?
that's right.
and where is he?
sleeping, I think.
you mind telling him up and at 'em? He's got some guests.
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
lucky, shh!
these are agents...
Holt and wilson. Morning...ish.
Hey.
what's this?
you out late last night, cal?
just, uh, you know, a couple beers with friends.
how many's a couple?
I don't know. Three, four tops.
if all you had was beer, then how come you're sweating vodka?
and looks to me like you slept in those clothes. Am I right?
I don't know. I-I guess.
so what you're saying is, you got blind drunk, you blacked out.
something tells me this isn't the first time.
so, cal, truthfully,
who knows what you've really been up to at night?
look, what's this about?
we're investigating the death of ronald garrigan.
my brother?
sorry for your loss.
Yeah, I thought that was some kind of animal attack.
no love lost between the two of you, huh?
look, we had our differences, I guess.
you love your brother, of course, but...
Ron had a lot of problems. He was, uh,
volatile.
last time he was here, you called the cops?
Yeah, look, he came in here all messed up,
and he was yelling.
he shoved mandy. So, yeah, I called the cops.
I don't see how that has to do with
your landlord were you aware of that?
saw it in the papers. Why?
well, you two were pretty far behind on your rent, right?
he had sent eviction papers?
I-I'm sorry. That was an animal attack.
funny enough, yeah -- Both of 'em were.
so, great, great. Yeah, guys.
what in the hell do you think I had to do with 'em?
just following procedure.
had to ask.
you two have a good day.
so, cal's a prince.
Yeah, doesn't know where he was last night.
bag him now?
no. We make sure.
Really? - Before we hand him over to a lifetime of demon
Yeah, really.
boy, cal just doesn't quit.
three scuzzy bars, one scuzzy strip club,
a chili-Dog joint, seven or eight nightcaps, and now...
scotches in the library.
I'm getting cirrhosis just watching this.
other than that, we got squat.
let's just see.
dude, sun's up.
this guy's still on two legs. In theory.
he ain't wolfing out.
well, not tonight, anyway.
let's head back. We can re-Attack this in a couple hours.
catch you later, man.
what are you doing?
EW! Oh, lucky, that's enough.
typical.
Oh, lucky. Honestly.
you are the only decent boyfriend I have ever had.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that it's not cal.
masterful deduction, sherlock.
I mean, a werewolf attack in daylight?
this whole thing is just weird.
dogs and cats living together -- Mass hysteria.
so, you know this means that we're down to one suspect, right?
I know. - I mean, mandy is right at the deep end of the
can you do it?
do what? - Shove her in the trunk, serve her up to crowley.
Yeah, Sam, I can do it.
Hey. Ugh.
you still feeling hot, baby?
here, have some juice. Make you feel better.
okay.
Hey, see? Lucky knows you're not feeling well,
and he wants you to feel better.
he loves you, doesn't he?
there's a good boy.
he loves a squeak. Yeah.
Uh-oh.
the leg broke off. Lucky, look what you did!
next up on the buffalo midday news,
we'll talk to animal control about the recent animal
but first, the weather.
what, am I interrupting the morning show? Come on. Let's go
Hey, is that blood?
have you killed a bird again?
bad dog!
okay, okay. Bye-Bye. - See you later. Bye.
ma'am?
agents. What are you doing here?
nobody called you?
called me about what?
I'm sorry.
I just can't believe it.
I'm really very sorry.
ma'am, I know this isn't the best time, but we'd like you to
Why?
you think I have something to do with this? With cal?
of course not.
we just got a few questions -- I's and t's, mostly.
I, uh...
uh, could we do it later?
I'm afraid not.
Oh.
my s-- My kid has the flu, um, and he was up all night, so
well, is there a neighbor or a friend who can watch him while
I'm sorry. You said your boy was up all night?
uh, yeah. - Were you with him all night?
um...
well, I had, um, half an hour of sleep, maybe.
can I talk to your son? - Why?
Yeah, what difference does that make, agent holt?
trust me. It's important.
please?
well, it wasn't her.
you don't know that.
she's got an alibi. She's lying.
you heard the kid, dude. She's not lying.
fine. She still had time to wolf out, Dean.
the last werewolf was in bed, with me,
and she wolfed out.
don't make this personal.
look, all I'm saying is that between this and the daylight
something's not adding up.
I'm not just gonna hand her over to crowley until we figure
okay. Okay. I understand.
how 'bout you go check out cal's crime scene, see if we're
I'll come back and keep an eye on amanda.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. How 'bout you go and I'll stay
Dean, I still know how to do my job.
I'm just gonna watch her. That's all.
trust me.
Uh-huh.
???
???? Thank god he's still breathing.
Hey!
wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait! Mister!
Hey, mister, wait! That's my dog!
that's my dog.
Hey.
Hey, man, it's me.
well, I got bupkes here.
I definitely got something. It ain't a werewolf, for one.
Yeah, what is it? - Skinwalker.
a skinwalker? As in...
as in, the family dog seriously needs a neuter.
Wow.
I haven't of a skinwalker in years. I'm actually a little
you and me both.
uh, I just got the low down from bobby.
they can change anywhere, anytime. Skinwalkers infect you with
otherwise, they're basically a werewolf cousin
silver will drop 'em, they chow hearts like snausages.
so what happened? Did you catch him?
not exactly. But I have some idea where he might be.
Hiya, lucky.
bad dog.
first thing's first.
you see this? This is silver.
don't say I didn't warn you.
okay, time to go.
now, we can either do this the easy way -- Hmm?
or the hard way.
what? Soul or not, that's funny.
well, I got to tell you, lucky,
you got us stumped.
I mean, why shack up with the family?
is it a kinky thing?
do you like to play with your food?
roll over, lucky. Speak.
go to hell. - Already been. Didn't agree with me.
so, look, how about I take this silver knife,
and start carving some dog until you behave?
you do what you got to do.
hang on, Sam.
listen, you don't have to tell me why you're with the family.
I get it.
Oh, you do, do you?
you killed every threat that came near them.
you care about them,
in your own whack-A-Doodle kind of way.
it's obvious.
what I want to know is,
who was that guy you were kibitzing with?
he a skinwalker, too?
look, I can't say anything.
but if you don't, then you're gonna put
the girl and the little boy in danger.
and sooner or later, all this crap is gonna come for them.
now, look, we don't give a rat's ass about you.
we want to help them.
that's our angle. That's it.
Yeah, that guy, he's a...
whatever it is I am.
and he's not the only one.
how many are you?
about 30. We were all -- We were kind of recruited.
recruited?
Yeah. Me, I was living on the streets.
they found me. They told me one small bite, I'd be strong, I'd be fast.
sniffing people's butts? Yeah, that's a real step up.
well, it was for me.
where is this little scooby gang of yours?
everywhere.
we're out there finding families, and once they take us in,
we lay low.
lay low"? What the hell's that mean?
well, we're waiting for the word.
what word?
once we're settled, we get the signal...
...and we all turn on our families.
we change them, all in one night.
30 becomes 150.
God, you're a sleeper cell.
Yeah, well, that's one way to say it.
so you're waiting for word from who?
who organized you?
there's a pack leader.
your alpha? - What's an alpha?
the -- The first skinwalker, the strongest.
well, he's plenty strong, but, no, I-I don't think so.
I'm pretty sure there's guys like him in other towns.
we're not the only pack out there.
fantastic. Then you can help us stop him.
Oh, no, I can't. No.
Yes, you can.
no, you guys don't get it. No one can.
these guys who turned me -- They're ruthless.
Sam, not helping.
fetch this, dick.
listen to me.
what are you gonna do to that family, really?
you gonna put your jaws around that little boy's throat?
clamp down, listen to him cry for his mom?
cause I'm gonna guess that these are the only people
who in your pathetic life have ever showed you any kindness.
so it's either that...
or you can help us stop it.
so...
how are we supposed to get near something
that can smell us 100 yards off?
we don't.
the pack leader.
we're taking him down?
Yeah. Got a better idea?
no, I...
Crowley's not gonna be too happy about that.
who gives a rat's ass?
we let that thing live one second,
and it sends out that psychic dog whistle and pchew!
on the other hand, it could lead us to an alpha.
then crowley would give me my soul back.
are you kidding?
150 people turned into monsters. That's what you want?
no. Of course not. I...
just asking.
all right, you know what? That's it. - What?
you say you're "just folks," yeah?
that -- That you like baseball and apple pie or whatever.
but truth is,
I don't know what you are 'cause you're not Sam.
Dean, come on.
I mean, it's your gigantor body and -- And maybe your brain,
but it's not you.
so just...stop pretending.
do us both a favor.
wouldn't you be?
I'd double-Cross us.
I mean, he's got to realize that's his best bet,
if he wants to keep breathing.
Nah, he'll go through with it.
you mean 'cause he loves that family?
Thanks, dexter. That's reassuring.
just making conversation.
take him out. - It's not clean.
we got one shot at this -- Literally.
take the shot.
come on, come on, come on. Ahh.
so, plan "b"?
we've got one?
please, whatever you want.
just please let my son go.
look, man, there's nothing I can do. The boss is pissed.
so, you with us or not?
Yes, of course I am.
fine. Prove it.
what is that?
mommy! - It's ok
Mandy! Come on, come on.
who are you?! I don't even know you!
here, baby, go under here.
okay, stay there, honey. You'll be safe.
you're protecting them?
after what I did for you?
I gave you your life back!
them?
you're nothing to them.
you're a dog.
I-I was gonna turn them.
but now I'm gonna kill 'em.
so you think this is gonna be a dogfight?
I got a better idea.
silver bullet, lucky.
Hi.
one...
I'm not here to bother you.
I just...uh, I just want to say one thing.
you and aidan...
you're the only family I ever had.
and I know
I know that sounds -- I know...
I know what I am. It...
get away from this house, you psycho.
and if you ever,
ever come near me or my son again,
so help me...
I know I probably deserve...
I'll never look at a dog the same.
what?
how many packs are out there.
what if they're all just waiting for the signal, you know?
so...I was thinking.
I'm not your brother.
I'm not Sam.
okay.
like lisa and ben, right?
is this supposed to make me feel better?
you wanted the real me. This is it.
and you're clearly not gonna stick around for much longer
unless I give it to you straight, so...
I've done a lot worse than you know.
I've killed innocent people in the line of duty.
but I'm pretty sure it's not something the old me could've done.
and maybe I should feel guilty.
but I don't.
Sam, get to the punch line.
look
I don't know if how I am
you get the job done, and nothing really hurts.
that's not the worst thing.
but I've been thinking.
I was that other Sam for a long time.
and it was...
let's just say I think I should probably go back to being him.
that's very interesting.
it's a step.
so?
then
Yeah, I think these are John Winchester's boys.
Hey, I'm Ellen. That's my daughter, Jo.
the can of whup ass I ought to open on you.
you better put me on speed dial, kid. - Yes, ma'am.
all-out hell happened out there.- Who let the dogs in.
we have to make a break for the building next door and I can wait here with my finger on the button.
if I can get us a shot on the devil, we have to take it.
but I will not leave you here alone.
it's civil war up there! - I know.
if we can beat Raphael, we can end this!
you did more than rebel.
you tore up the whole script and burned the pages for all of us.
do you have any idea what souls are worth?
Rufus Turner? - No.
I ain't asking for no help. - Never seen that dick.
I'm not asking for your permission. - Just like old times.
long as I get to drive.
what are you? - Eve cooked me up herself.
the mother of all of us...
she has a message for you.
it was my fault.
now
Chester, pennsylvania
piece of crap.
damn it.
my HEART WILL GO ON say something.
you
no. You.
you two just gonna stand there like the ugly girl at the prom, or you gonna pitch in?
this so-called Eve, mother, whatever ain't gonna gank herself.
what's wrong with you two?
Bobby, you haven't slept in days.
I sleep. What are you, my wife now?
I'm just saying that, you know, taking five might be a good thing.
for whom?
look, Bobby, it was... it was tough for all of us, - seeing Rufus go like that. - You think this...
this ain't about Rufus.
Bobby, he wasn't just a poker buddy.
you know when I knew Rufus was done for?
the day I met him.
the only question was, who first... him or me?
now, you want to stand there and therapize, or you want to get me some coffee?
make it Irish.
well, he's doing fantastic.
Yeah. This isn't about Rufus at all.
well, what do you want to do?
I mean, we can't just sit here and watch him poop out his liver.
well, we could get him out of the house. There's a job.
Really? What do you got?
look. Chester, Pennsylvania.
three people got kicked off in the last week, all freaky.
last guy got karate-chopped by his garage door.
and these are all blood relatives.
what are you thinking, family curse? - Could be.
Hey, grumpy...
you, uh... - I don't want to do crap. Leave me alone.
just...get out of my house, both of you.
you're driving me nuts.
now!
for the love of Pete.
you know, maybe we should wait till she gets back.
dude, she just called from the road, said she'd be here in "two shakes.
you really want to sit around and smell him stew in his juices?
Yeah, yeah. Drive.
what the...
tell me you haven't been drinking this whole time.
you're worse than the boys. I'm working.
my God. I'm gone a week, and this place goes completely to hell.
what is wrong with you, Bobby Singer?
get a pen. It's a long list.
you smell like a bar, you know that?
you don't exactly smell like a rose yourself.
Yeah, I been hunting with Jo. What's your excuse?
if I need one, I got a good one.
I know. And I'm so sorry.
he meant a lot to me, too.
go wash up. I'll fix us something.
anybody ever tell you you're a pain in the ass?
that's why you married me.
go.
don't tell me what to do, Ellen.
Chester, Pennsylvania
not a bleep.
well, not a vengeful spirit, then.
so what is it?
whatcha got?
what is that, Christmas tinsel?
I don't know.
it's gold.
you mean, like, gold gold?
why would a handyman have gold just lying around in his garage?
I don't know.
there is definitely a skeleton in this family's closet.
I mean, accidents don't just happen accidentally.
you know what I mean.
all right. How about I'll go check family records, you go with next of kin?
Yeah.
on the courthouse steps... for the deposition.
no, I told you, 3:00 P. M.
no, my usual fees.
I got to go, Ma.
I'm sorry. Uh, what department?
genealogy. From the university.
W-W-WE'RE doing a study on local families, and, well, the Russos are a big one...
Yeah, you know what? I got to tell you, - I am extremely busy right now, so...- Yeah, I-I'm sure you've had a rough week.
I, uh, read about the recent tragedies. Your cousins, right?
Yeah. It's a shame.
but I'm not that close with my family, so, uh...
is this gonna take long?
no. Five minutes. Five minutes.
uh, can you... can you tell me anything noteworthy about the Russos?
noteworthy? No.
I mean, not exactly... average, you know, big, from Italy.
I see. was anyone ever killed or maimed in a war
or... you know, some other violent thing?
what do you mean? - Like something so dark that it would Sully future generations.
no.
good. Good stuff.
anyone own a slave?
what? - Routine question.
any ties to the Nazi party?
excuse me? - Did grandma ever piss off a gypsy?
okay, you know what?
I don't know what kind of study you're doing, but it's over right now, - so, if you don't mind...- Okay, I-I'll just cut to the chase here.
your life is in danger.
what? What is that, a-a threat? Are you threatening me?
no, no, no. No, no. I'm not threatening you.
I'm just simply saying that...
if you don't watch your back, you're gonna die.
get the hell out of my office. - Okay.
now!
Hey. - Sam.
find anything?- One ass-hat in a shiny suit. You?
not much. Great grandparents born in Calabria.
emigrated 1912. Been here ever since.
what, no severed horse head?
four generations of picket fence.
if these people are the Waltons, then why the hell are they dying?
well, how about Cuba?
it's beautiful this time of year.
and the new Trump casino... amazing.
don't worry about the kids. There's a wave pool.
Oh! Sure, yeah!
look, if you like cigars, Cher, or the circus, it's all about Havana.
Yes, I've seen the Shatner ads.
but you know what they don't have?
personal touch.
okay, then. I'll e-mail you some details.
you too.
we sure she's not a Russo, a second cousin twice removed or something?
no, I checked the records twice. She's not related.
Oh, if this isn't a family curse, then what the hell is it?
you got me. I got nothing.
hold on.
not nothing.
so, we found another piece of this, I don't know, shiny string.
I was afraid of that. - Why? What's up?
Oh, these so-called accidents... we're seeing 'em nationwide.
about 75 so far.
I got Jo and her crew working on a cluster in California.
blood relatives?
some yeah, some no. She's got about what you do...
pile of bodies and a whole bunch of gold thread.
so what's it mean? - I don't know.
I got Bobby working on it right now.
how's he doing, by the way?
Oh, don't worry. I'm kicking his ass back to health and happiness.
who asked you to? To hell with you.
I heard that.
he'll be okay.
are you okay? - Oh, honey, you're sweet.
you know me. I just worry about you boys.
Yeah, well...
all right, so, all these corpses...anything relate 'em?
well, actually, I did dig up one thing.
I just don't know what to make of it. - Hit me.
well, it's a weird one, and it was buried pretty deep, but
Bobby and me were combing through the family trees on all the victims, and we started seeing, the families all came over to America the same year.
Yeah. 1912. But here's the real weird part...
they all came over on the same boat.
Really? - Yep.
all right, so what's so special about the boat?
nothing. It was a boat. It did what boats do.
what was it called? - The Titanic.
you ever hear of it?
no.
Yeah, me neither.
I'll keep digging. - All right.
does the name Titanic ring a bell?
Titanic?
no.
the RMS Titanic was the largest passenger steamship in the world "when it made its maiden voyage across the north Atlantic in 1912.
so what's the big friggin' deal? It's a ship. It sailed.
Yeah, I don't know.
Oh, looks like there was a close call. Ship almost hit an iceberg.
almost? So?
so, uh, looks like the first mate spotted it just in time.
good for him. There anything else?
wait a second.
what? - this first mate...
Mr. I. P. Freeley.
well, that's not suspicious.
you got a picture of old Freeley?
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
let's see.
first Mate I. P.Freeley RMS Titanic
boys, boys, boys. Whatever can I do for you?
we need to talk.
Oh, you seem upset, Dean.
the hell with the boat, Balthazar.
what boat? -The Titanic.
Yeah. The Titanic. Yes, well, it was meant to sink, and I saved it.
what? - It was meant to bash into this iceberg thing and plunge into the briny deep with all this hoopla, and I saved it.
anything else I can answer for you?
Why? - Why what?
why did you un-sink the ship?
Oh, because I hated the movie.
what movie? - Exactly.
wait, so you saved a cruise liner because...
because that God-awful Celine Dion song made me want to smite myself.
who's Celine Dion?
Oh, she's a destitute Lounge singer somewhere in Quebec, and let's keep it that way, please.
okay, I didn't think that was possible.
I thought you couldn't change history.
haven't you noticed? There's no more rules, boys.
the nerve on you.
so you just, what, un-sunk a giant boat?
Oh, come on. I saved people.
I thought you loved that kind of thing.
Yeah, but now those people and their kids and their kids' kids...
they must have interacted with so many other people, changed so much crap, you totally butterfly-effected history!
dude. Dude. Rule one, no Kutcher references.
Ah, yes. Unfortunately, there's still an Ashton Kutcher.
and you still averted the Apocalypse, and there are still archangels.
it's just the small details that are different, like you don't drive an Impala.
Yes, yes. "What's an Impala?"Trust me, it's not important.
and, of course, Ellen and Jo are alive.
Ellen and Jo? What?
Yes, they're supposed to be dead.
you see, I save a boat, one thing leads to another, which leads to another thousand things, and yada, yada, yada.
to cut a long story short, they don't die in a massive explosion.
anyway, let's agree I did a good thing.
one less Billy Zane movie, and I saved two of your closest friends.
but now somebody is killing the descendants of the survivors.
And? - And that's maybe like 50, 000 people.
And? - And we need to save as many as we can, but we need to know who's after 'em.
Oh, oh, sorry.
you have me confused with the other angel...
you know, the one in the dirty trenchcoat who's in love with you.
I...don't care.
goodbye, boys.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
son of a bitch!
so, Balthazar un-sank a boat, and now we got a boatload of people who should never have been born.
Yeah. Like 50, 000. - Makes sense.
how does any of this make sense?
because I got an idea who we're up against.
what?
fate.
you mean... - I mean Fate, like the Fates.
or one of 'em, at least.
you mean like Greek mythology? Like the sisters?
bingo. - Nerd.
these ladies are responsible for how you go down, literally.
so if you get creamed by a garage door or crunched by a copy machine, they're the ones who hammer out the details of how you die.
spin out your fate on a piece of pure gold.
gold thread.
and then one of 'em writes it all down in her day runner of death.
high-level stuff.
anyway... fits. Now we know what Balthazar did.
it seems to me that maybe fate is just trying to clean up the mess.
so, how do we stop it?
how do we stop fate? Good question.
well, there's got to be a way. - Or there ain't.
I mean, this is fate we're talking about here.
you know, the easiest way would be to get that angel to re-sink the boat.
no. No way. Forget it.
big difference between dying awful and never being born, Dean.
we are not sinking the boat, Bobby.
okay? Don't even think about it. - Well, okay. What's got your panties in a clench?
nothing.
try that again?
it...
look, it... it... it doesn't even really matter, but...
But?
apparently, a crap-load of dominoes get tipped over if the Titanic goes down.
and, bottom line...
Ellen and Jo die.
okay, you two. Listen up.
you make sure...
keep those angels from sinking that boat.
you understand me?
Yeah. Yes. - Yeah, Bobby, of course.
he's bad enough with her.
think how he'd be if she was gone.
Yeah.
so, what do we do?
I mean, how do we save 50, 000 people?
I got no freakin' clue.
Yeah. We don't even know who they are.
well, we know one.
that's him. Let's go.
hello.
Yeah. What? - Mr. Russo!
I don't care. Send him a fruitcake.
Shawn! Who's the judge?
all right, send him a nice bottle of champagne.
Shawn! - But nothing more than $30... ah, no. 20 bucks.
believe me, this guy... he owes me a favor.
Russo, stop!
get off of me.
and you... I told you to leave me alone, didn't I?
look, we're just trying to help you out, okay?
help me? You almost killed me, you lunatic.
give me that. Unbelievable.
just be glad I'm not suing your ass!
you've got to be kidding me.
Sam, check it out.
what?
too soon?
Yeah, Dean. I'm pretty sure six seconds is too soon.
I think I saw her.
right over there.
her? Like Fate her? - Yeah.
What'd she look like?
kind of like a librarian.
your kind of librarian or my kind of librarian?
well, she was wearing clothes, if that's what you mean.
all right.
wait, wait, wait. We can't just walk over there.
we're not on the hit list.
we have nothing to do with the boat. Let's go talk to her.
talk.
Yeah, you know.
talk. Worth a shot, right?
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, come on.
you got a lighter? - Yeah.
Oh, come on. It's out of juice or something?
it shouldn't be.
Hello, Dean. Sam.
where are we? - White Russia.
what?
are you aware of what your frat bro did?
I'm aware. Balthazar can be impetuous.
well, riddle me this...
if fate's going after the boat people, why'd she try to waste me and Sam?
well, I imagine she harbors a certain degree of rage toward you.
what did we do?
nothing of import... just the tiny matter of averting the apocalypse and rendering her obsolete.
I think maybe she's a little irritated about that.
and then you go and dangle yourselves in front of her...
so we've pissed fate off personally.
if I know her... and I do...
she won't stop until you're dead.
awesome.
so what do we do?
kill her.
kill fate?
do you have another suggestion?
no, I'm... I just mean, uh...
can you even do that?
Balthazar has a weapon that will work against her.
of course he does. Yeah.
boy, that guy's just got it covered, doesn't he?
you need new friends, Cass.
I'm trying to save the ones I have, Dean.
we'll have to draw her out.
all right, well, uh, she's gunning for us.
she's bound to surface again eventually.
we'll make it easy for her.
I think you have an expression for it.
tempting Fate.
Yeah, well, you just be careful.
that was Jo. 30 more dead on the west coast.
what exactly do those boys think they're gonna do?
if anybody can pull this out of their ass, it's those two.
Yeah, you ever hear the saying "you can't stop fate"?
you know, cleanest fix would just be to sink the boat.
why would you say that?
well, because, right now they're all dying bloody.
it's not the same as never being born.
you're talking about people...
people who are loved...
who would be missed.
what the hell is up with you?
nothing.
Oh, please. You are a neon sign.
so, I can beat it out of you, or we could just skip that part... dealer's choice.
so, not just me, but Jo, too?
they're not gonna sink the boat. I promise.
the boat stays. You don't have to worry.
well...
if it was meant to be, then...
I guess whatever happens, happens.
but that's just my point. Nothing's "meant to be.
whether we're together is at the whim of some dick angel.
Oh, Bobby, relax. - I can't.
we need you.
especially me.
I know.
okay, so, we're just gonna meet our fate at any time, right?
Yeah.
just walk. Act natural.
okay.
that's fine.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Sam, they're juggling knives.
and hatchets. - Yeah, I know.
can't avoid fate.
all right. I don't get it.
I don't either.
who do you got to kill to get killed around here?
maybe Cass was wrong.
look out!
Atropos.
you look well.
I look like stomped-over crap, because of you.
all right, let's talk about this.
talk? About what?
maybe about how you and those two circus clowns destroyed my work.
you ruined my life.
let's not get emotional.
not get emotional?!
I had a job.
God gave me a job.
we all had a script.
I worked hard.
I was really, really good at what I did...
until the day of the big prize fight.
and then what happens? You throw out the book!
well, I'm sorry.
but freedom is more preferable.
freedom? This is chaos! How is it better?
you know, I even went to heaven just to ask what to do next, and you know what?
no one would even talk to me.
there are more pressing matters at hand.
but I don't know what happens next.
I need to know. It's what I do.
I'm sorry.
but your services are no longer required.
you know what?
I've kept my mouth shut.
I could have complained, I could have raised a fuss, but I didn't.
but you know what the last straw is?
Un-sinking the Titanic.
you changed the future. You cannot change the past.
that is going too far!
it's Balthazar. He's erratic... - Bull crap.
this isn't about some stupid movie.
he's under your orders.
you sent him back to save that ship.
no, I didn't.
why would I?
Oh, maybe because you're in the middle of a war and you're desperate?
come on. This is about the souls.
you don't know what you're talking about.
that angel went and created 50, 000 new souls for your war machine.
you're confused.
no.
you can't just mint money, castiel.
it's wrong...
it's dangerous...
and I won't let you.
you don't have a choice.
maybe I don't.
so here's a choice for you.
if you don't go back and sink that boat,
I'm gonna kill your two favorite pets.
I won't let you.
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?
do you really want to test me?
okay. Fine.
but think about this...
I've got two sisters out there.
they're bigger, in every sense of the word.
kill me...
Sam and Dean are target one.
for simple vengeance.
you're not fighting a war or anything, right?
you can watch them every millisecond of every day.
because maybe you've heard...
fate strikes when you least expect it.
Balthazar, stop.
awkward.
set things right before I flick your precious boys off a cliff just on principle.
uh, sweetie, before we go, um,
I could remove that stick from your...
don't try me.
Oh. We'll leave it inserted, then.
all right, then.
let's sink the Titanic.
dude, what time is it?
I-I just had the weirdest dream.
20 bucks says mine was weirder. I am not kidding.
no, no. I'm not kidding either.
I-I mean, it was...
just bizarre.
mine had the actual Titanic in it.
what?
something on my face?
d-did it, uh...
not sink, because Balthazar...
had a hate on for Billy Zane?
why are you having my dreams, dude?
wasn't a dream.
wait, what?
you're saying this actually happened?
that t-the whole... whatever... t-that was real?
Yes.
so, what happened?
well, I insisted he go back in time - and correct what he'd done. - What?
Why?
it was the only way to be sure you were safe.
so...
so, you killed...
50, 000 people for us.
no, I didn't. They were never born.
that's far different from being killed, wouldn't you say?
Ellen and Jo?
I'm sorry.
hold on.
so, if you guys went a-and changed everything back, then that whole timeline or whatever, it just got erased?
Yeah. More or less.
well, then, how come he and I remember it?
because I wanted you to remember it.
Why?
I wanted you to know who fate really is.
she's cruel and capricious.
I'd go so far as "bitch.
well, yeah.
you're the ones who taught me that you can make your own destiny.
you don't have to be ruled by fate.
you can choose freedom.
I still believe that that's something worth fighting for.
I just wanted you to understand that.
so, wait.
did... Balthazar really, uh, unravel the sweater over a chick flick?
Yes.
Absolutely. That's what he did.
Wow. Well, might be time to take away his cable privileges.
Besides,"Titanic" didn't suck that bad.
winslet's rack.
I'll tell you one thing about Cass, he does not appreciate the finer things.
I guess things are back to normal, huh?
normal." Awesome.
poor bastard.
doesn't even know how good he had it.
Yeah, well, what he doesn't know won't hurt him.
I say we keep our mouths shut.
Yeah. I'm with you.
should we wake him?
that's probably the best he's felt all week.
I don't believe it.
Wyoming? What does that mean?
each of these x's is an abandoned frontier church
all mid-19th century, built by Samuel Colt.
samuel Colt -- the demon-killing, gunmaking Samuel Colt?
Yep. He built private railway lines connecting church to church.
it just happens to lay out like this.
it's a devil's trap.
a 100-square-mile devil's trap.
1973
what is this? - What does it look like?
is it real? - Very.
okay, so, what, angels got their hands on some DeLoreans?
how did I get here?
time is fluid, Dean.
it's not easy, but we can bend it on occasion.
but I'm thinking you know "Purgatory.
this is all about opening a door to let something in.
what? - I'm working on it.
could you give us something?
I got a name."Mother of all.
we got zero on ganking her.
we have so much to do. Let's get started.
she has a message for you.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
you're all gonna die.
it's here, somewhere. I know it.
help me move this.
I'll be damned.
welcome to the Campbell family library.
so, Samuel collected all this stuff, huh?
apparently.
all right, well, what are we looking for?
well, anything that'll put a run in the Octomom's stockings.
pick a row.
bingo.
either of you jokers ever heard anything about a Phoenix?
river, Joaquin, or the giant flaming bird?
it says here that the ashes of a Phoenix can burn the mother.
the mother?
great. Where do we get one?
you got me. I thought it was a myth.
all right, great.
well, let's see if we can find something out about a Phoenix.
guys. Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, check this out.
march 5, 1861."Sunrise, Wyoming.
gun killed a Phoenix today.
left a pile of smoldering ash.
Really? Whose gun?
Colt's.
colt? Colt like - like the Colt.
from...
...Samuel Colt's Journal.
What?!
that's his? - Yeah.
dude, no. - Dude, yes.
well, let me see it. - Get your own.
well, what else did he say about the Phoenix?
what does it look like? Has it got feathers?
it just says "Phoenix.
did he say where he tracked it? - No.
all right, so I guess we got to find one of our own, whatever it is.
I know where we can find one.
march 5, 1861. Sunrise, Wyoming.
we'll "Star Trek IV" this bitch.
I only watched "Deep Space Nine.
it's like I don't even know you guys anymore.
star Trek IV." Save the whales.
we hop back in time, we join up with Samuel Colt, we hunt the Phoenix, and then we haul the ashes back home with us.
time travel? - Yeah.
that's a reasonable plan?
we got a guy who can swing it.
the, uh, fate of the world is in the balance.
so, come on down here.
come on, Cass, "I Dream of Jeannie" your ass down here pronto.
please.
Jeannie?
Rachel.
I understand you need some assistance?
how can I help you?
well, uh, we kind of need to talk to the Big Kahuna.
I'm here on Castiel's behalf.
where is he? - Busy.
busy? - Yes.
well, we've got a line on the mother of freaking everything, so
I'm sure your issue's very important.
but Castiel is currently commanding an army, so
so we get stuck with miss Moneypenny.
so you need to learn your place.
look, I don't know who you think you are
I'm his friend. - What, you think we're not?
I think you call him when you need something.
we're fighting a war. - We get that.
entitled little pie - Rachel.
that's enough.
I told you I'd take care of this.
it's all right. You can go.
you're staying? - Go.
I'll come when I can.
Wow. Friend of yours?
Yes. She's, uh, my lieutenant.
she's... committed to the cause.
now, what do you need?
where the hell's Dean?
supply run, he said. I don't know.
um, about your plan.
you'll only have 24 hours.
wait, what? Why?
Yeah, aim lower.
the further back I send you, the harder it becomes to retrieve you.
24 hours is all I can risk.
if I don't pull you home within that time, you'll be lost to me.
well, then we better get you a watch.
what the hell's all that?
we are going native. Got to blend in.
Sam. - Dean, I can -- I can wear this.
and look like a spaceman?
look, just because you're obsessed with all that Wild West stuff
no, I'm not. - You have a fetish.
shut up. I like old movies.
you can recite every Clint Eastwood movie ever made, line for line.
even the monkey movies? - Yeah. Especially the monkey movies.
his name is Clyde.
at least wear the damn shirt.
Dean, this is stupid. I look stupid.
you going to a hoedown?
now, is it - is it customary to wear a blanket?
it's a sarape. And, yes. It's, uh...
never mind. Let's just go.
what's this?
where you're goin', they don't take plastic.
I'll send you back to March 4th.
that should give you time to find the Colt...
... and this Phoenix creature.
all right, well, see ya at High Noon tomorrow.
Oh, now we're talking.
I have to go. - What about getting the boys back?
pray for me in 24 hours, and I'll return.
I'll pray for all of us.
all right. Let's go find Samuel Colt.
Hey, we should try the Saloon first, uh, see what we get from the locals.
sure. Whatever, Sundance.
think we'll have time to hit on saloon girls?
I'm kidding. Come on.
Oh, damn it. Come on.
you know what that is?
Yeah, it's horse - Authenticity!
we stand here today -- March 4th, 1861
to execute justice upon Elias Finch for the murder of his own wife.
Wow. Talk about authenticity.
sentence handed down by myself,
Tye Mortimer, duly appointed judge of the Wyoming circuit.
you will be hung by your neck until you die.
you got anything to say?
you're gonna burn for this.
every one of you.
good times.
so where do we find Sammy Colt?
no idea.
huh. I think I know who to ask, though.
nice blanket.
sheriff? Can we have a word?
depends who's askin'.
marshal Eastwood.
Clint Eastwood.
this here is, uh, Walker.
he's a Texas Ranger.
so, what can I do for you boys?
uh, we're looking for a man.
I'll bet.
nice shirt, there
what's wrong with my shirt?
you're very clean.
it's dirtier than it looks.
we need to find Samuel Colt. Do you know him?
the gun maker? - Yeah. Is he in town?
not that I know of.
might try asking elkins over at the Saloon.
been here longer than God.
this is not awesome.
Hi. What'll you have?
Oh, uh, okay. Great.
I'll have your top-shelf whiskey.
only have the one shelf.
that'll do just fine. And he'll have a sarsaparilla - You Elkins? - One and only.
you know a man named Samuel Colt?
he passed through here about four years ago.
he still around?
rumor is, he's building a railroad stop 20 miles out of town, just by the Postal road.
middle of nowhere.
the Devil's Gate? - Location fits.
howdy, boys.
Darla's my best girl.
try me. You want a kiss?
s-so much more germier than I pictured.
Ah. Judge.
nice to see you.
I thought we had a date.
wow, that was a close one.
I guess it's good to be judge. - Yeah.
Ohh. It's like gasoline.
sarsaparilla ain't half bad.
you okay, Sheriff? - 'Course I'm okay.
it was a ghost! - It wasn't a ghost.
unless ghosts leave footprints.
I am telling you, Elias Finch was here.
he did... that, and then he walked out that door.
rope didn't kill him. Seen it before.
well, you got any idea where he could be?
could be a thousand places.
well, you got a way to flush him out?
course. We're gonna form a posse.
then we're gonna string Finch up right.
put a bullet in his head for good measure.
that actually sounds like a good plan.
you two should come along.
meet downstairs at dawn.
Yeah, we'll be there.
get yourselves some real gear first, huh?
well, I think we ought to pay our respects to Finch.
I was thinking the same thing.
you thinking what I'm thinking?
rose from the ashes, burned up its victim?
you know, maybe we're not looking for a flaming bird.
maybe the Phoenix is actually walking around in cowboy boots.
that makes sense, right?
could be Finch.
so, question is, how do we put this thing out?
well, we do know one thing that'll kill friggin'anything, right?
Yeah, the Colt. - So, you go get the gun.
but isn't the gun coming here?
I mean, according to Samuel Colt's journal?
Yeah, but people here barely even know who Colt is.
maybe you got to go find him and make history.
I'll stay here, hook up with the posse.
cause you know me --I'm a posse magnet . I mean, I love posse.
make that into a t-shirt.
you done?
look, the problem is, Colt's 20 miles outside of town.
how am I supposed to get there and back before noon?
ride 'em, cowboy.
wh-- uh, try -- try the other side.
Yeah, good boy. - Right. Yeah. Right.
Hey. This actually feels all right.
all right, take it -- just take it easy.
Yeah, you bet. I'm good.
all right, 11: 00 A. M.right? - Don't be late!
okay. - All right. Go on. Go. Hyah!
I'm okay!
that poor horse.
forgive me! I'm sorry!
you had your chance.
tell it to the judge.
we need to talk.
you summoned me here?
Castiel, I've been hearing things.
things I don't want to believe.
just tell me if it's true.
if what's true? - You know.
your dirty little secret.
I have to defeat Raphael. - Not this way, Castiel.
Rachel. - We put our faith in you, and.
... look what you're turning into.
I don't have a choice.
then neither do I.
I'm sorry.
what the hell is going on?!
are we running or fighting?
we're...
balls.
new hat.
I look good.
Where's the posse?
I must be early.
or you're the only greenhorn dumb enough to go chasing after a ghost.
what are you talking about? Sheriff's tough as nails. He'll be here.
Oh, God! The Sheriff's dead!
or not.
great.
who's the Sheriff now?
what. What...
now...
congratulations, Sheriff.
you have the wrong drunk, gentlemen.
have a nice day.
we've been looking for you, Colt.
and who might "we" be?
listen...
I've long since hung it up.
I'm tired, and I'm too damn old for this, and I'm sure as hell not looking for any trouble.
well, it's found you anyway.
we know you built that Devil's gate, Colt.
so you're gonna open it for us.
that is, if you fancy keeping your lungs in your chest.
walk away, gentlemen.
well, I think we'd rather rip you to ribbons, you soft
Ah, that's a shame.
a damn shame.
who's there?
Candygram for Mongo.
howdy, pilgrim.
I ain't no pilgrim.
all right, back up.
is that any way to, uh...
greet your new boss?
missed you at the posse this morning.
I was a one-man wolf pack, thanks to you.
what's going on here?
going to visit my sister.
well, she'll have to wait.
but if I don't-- -Finch said he was coming back for the former Sheriff...
...Judge Mortimer...
... and you.
that's two down and one to go.
then just let me go!
you really think you can outrun him?
he is going to kill you.
unless...
unless what?
unless we gank him first.
Gank"? What's "gank"?
mister, you're crazy.
no way. You're on your own.
I'm not asking you to throw down with him.
I'm asking you to play your part.
my part? - Yeah.
bait.
Hello?
okay, not a demon! Not a demon!
just -- just a hunter. Sheesh.
you're what?
you Samuel Colt?
my name is Sam Winchester.
I'm -- I'm a hunter from the year 2011.
prove it.
all right.
a-all right?
that's -- uh, that's it?
well, when you've done this job as long as I have...
...a giant from the future with some magic brick doesn't exactly give you the vapors.
I need your help killing a Phoenix.
a Phoenix? They exist?
well, you shoot one in about three hours.
if you say so.
I don't.
you do.
that's...
I'm either too drunk or not drunk enough.
so what is it I'm about to exactly do?
well, the Phoenix is in sunrise, so, uh, if we leave now, you can
I appreciate your situation, but I'm not gonna be of any help to you.
I'm booked.
right, but -- but you say right here
don't believe everything that you read.
but you're a hunter.
retired.
there's no such thing. - I'm out.
there is no getting out.
look, for what it's worth, in my time, you're a hero.
me? - Yes, sir.
now, look, we -- we need to kill this Phoenix.
its ashes are the only thing that can kill the monster I'm hunting.
so stow your crap for a few hours, and let's go.
we got to go now.
so, either you're coming with me, or I need the gun.
what gun?
the gun.
Oh, that gun.
I lost it in a game of Stud.
you're lying.
am I?
now, that doesn't sound like me.
you shot a couple of demons with it less than an hour ago.
how do you figure?
two pairs of bootprints.
cabin reeks of sulfur.
not bad.
you don't want it.
it's a curse. Believe me.
great. Then let me take it off your hands.
you go put on a few more miles and come back, and we'll talk.
trust me, I've got plenty of mileage.
I'm doing you a favor. Believe me.
so, what? You can really just sit there?
I've given my whole life to this.
I'm done. -- So it doesn't matter what happens.
no, it doesn't. -So everything you did, it all means nothing?
give me the gun.
Cass, you -- you like you went 12 rounds with truckasaurus.
what happened?
I was, uh...
I was betrayed.
Rachel, uh...
he corrupted her. She turned on me.
sorry.
girl was a real... peach.
she's... dead.
I... was wounded. I needed...
safety. Thank you.
what's with the finger painting?
it's a warding symbol against angels.
how bad's it hurt?
I'll heal.
well, good... 'Cause we got less than an hour before you pick up the kids at Frontierland.
I can't.
come again?
this fight... Drained me.
well, if you're up on blocks, then call in another halo who can get the job done.
I can't.
well, there's got to be something that can juice you up.
a spell -- something.
there is one thing that might work, but...
it's extremely dangerous.
shocker.
so, lay it on me.
it's your soul.
what do you want me to do?
make another deal? Seal it with a kiss?
I need you to let me touch it.
touch it? -The human soul -- it's pure...
energy. If I can siphon some of that off,
I-I might be able to bring Sam and Dean back.
and the catch is...?
doing this is like...
putting your hand in a nuclear reactor.
I have to do it very gingerly.
or...?
or you'll explode.
well.
keep both hands on the wheel.
let's do this.
never been late in your damn life, Sam, and now you're dragging ass.
so this is your big plan, huh?
just let me rot in here till Finch comes?
pretty much.
Why's he gunning for you, anyway?
I guess you missed the part where we hung him?
no, I'm thinking to a thing like Finch, that's no big whoop.
he would've just blown town, but he came back.
that seems personal.
I'll tell you what you let me out of here, and we'll talk.
no can do.
open up that cell.
open it yourself.
you melt people's faces off.
I'll bet you got the juice to tear that apart easy, don't you?
unless you can't.
just like you couldn't break those cuffs when they strung you up.
iron shackles...
...iron bars, iron nail. See a pattern?
don't worry. Most creatures I meet can't get it up for iron.
it's a common monster problem.
so you're a hunter.
slash sheriff.
you know what this son of a bitch did?
do tell.
I was married to a woman. Good woman -- human.
we lived outside of town, didn't bother anyone.
sure, freak with a heart of gold.
you want to call me "monster," fine.
but all we did was go into town.
I go into the bank for five minutes. I come out, she's gone.
and then I heard her scream.
this... man had her pinned in the alley.
I go to stop him, he pulls his gun, shoots me, then her.
she died in my arms.
course, I don't die.
the shots brought the Sheriff.
next thing I know, I'm in iron.
that's why I want him just where he is
trapped, scared.
I saved the best for last.
is that true?
so tell me
are you really willing to die to protect this piece of filth?
honestly, I could care less about him.
he's a dick and a coward. - Hey!
but this ain't about him.
I know what you are.
Really?
Yeah.
so... I got to kill you.
well, if you know what I am, then you know you can't.
wow, I should've seen that coming.
Sam, come on, come on!
Hey, where's Colt?
he's not coming. - What?!
but he sent this.
Hello, beautiful.
all right. - Come on.
are you sure?
well, we can't just strand those idjits in Deadwood, can we?
the risks... Just...
don't explode me.
get out here, Finch!
what are you doing?!
come on! Let's do this!
so, this is how you want to die.
fine.
the ashes!
Dean, look at him. He's fried.
I never want to do that again.
Bobby, you -- -I'm still kickin', Annie oakley.
be back good as new in...
a decade or two.
and we screwed the pooch.
Bobby, I'm sorry.
is there a Sam Winchester here?
who's asking?
look, this is nuts
me and a couple guys made a bet.
so... this thing's been laying around the office since... ever!?
uh, with a note on it saying to bring it here today.
it's from a-a Samuel Colt?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's -- that's mine.
great. Thanks. Thanks.
dear Sam,
I got this address and date "off your thingamajig, "and I thought the enclosed might come in handy.
regards, Samuel Colt.
is that what I think it is?
ashes of a Phoenix.
you know what this means?
Yeah, I didn't get a "soulonoscopy" for nothing.
hello. - Bobby singer?
my surgeon is a monster please get your ass here to, sioux falls general hospital.
they're like shapeshifters, only a lot more into eatin' folk.
and... Nothing can kill 'em.
anything else? - Yep. They bleed black goo.
.Hi, Dean.
the spell only lasts for a few days.
the stuff you don't talk about doesn't just go away.
what the hell are you talking about? - I'm talking about whatever you're not telling me about!
we're good. Right? - We're good.
you sure about this?
trust me.
good morning... Megan.
that is a really, really pretty dress.
thank you. It's vintage.
well, it looks new on you. - Aren't you sweet, sir?
call me Dean.
how can I help you today, Dean?
um, well, I don't actually have an account at this bank, but I was wondering if there was any way...
I could get change for that?
I think I can make an exception... Just for you.
Thanks.
how do you want it, Dean?
well, I'm gonna have to take a rain check... And all your money.
hands in the air! Hands in the air!
your money's insured, so no heroes, okay?
you ready? - Yep.
okay, Chet. Let's see how you like a little fruit of the poison tree.
isn't that just a legal expression?
you're gonna wish it was.
oaky.
similar finish to holy water, not as bitter as rock salt.
and how are my two favorite meat-sicles?
is he still sucking air?
greatest hits didn't do the trick.
I'm down to B-sides and deep cuts.
well, you better figure out something quick.
that whammy that witch dude put on him is only gonna last for a few days.
he gets his spinach back, we're gonna end up having to drop a car on him just to stop him.
actually... Edgar walked away from that car.
he's fine. Well, he is a little pissed at you, but ...
you didn't know? - Why don't you shut your caketrap?
Bobby... You've been using all this stuff and he still won't talk?
huddle over, coach?
how'd you find us?
it was easy.
I used pattern-recognition software and a basic heuristic algorithm to track your known aliases.
great. Just what we need --a Mensa monster.
all right. Let's just start with the start.
Where'd you get our aliases?
from your trench-coated friend, obviously.
when we were all nestled in at Camp Cass, kind of got the full download.
that's just how we do.
so why are you talking to us, Chet?
you're not dumb. Why you spilling state secrets?
cause I'm not scared of you.
you can't stop me.
you can't stop any of us.
we can't be killed, you stupid little chewtoys.
you are aware that I'm the least of your concerns, right?
Oh.
you haven't watched the news today, have you?
the two men, who up until today were presumed dead, locked the doors and opened fire, leaving no survivors.
Sam and Dean Winchester are now the subjects of a manhunt throughout the state of California.
busy morning, you two? - Those sons of bitches xeroxed us.
but I don't understand how.
I don't know.
maybe one of 'em touched you at the hospital.
it was the hair!
not too hard to lift some DNA out of a motel shower drain, guys!
you can copy people like that? - Awesome.
well, what is their plan, exactly? - Squeeze us.
turn us into the most wanted men in America.
all right. Well, that settles it.
we find these ass monkeys, and we kill them ourselves. - Wait a sec.
