I did steal your party theme.
Oh, no, did you go for the discount,
Swizzler, garbage-party theme too?
Oh, god, no. I finally had some sense pecked, scratched,
and clawed into me And realized that people just wouldn't get it.
so I went with my original your original idea
the orgy dome and whatnot.
um, attention, everybody.
I, um-- we all have so much.
but now I would like to show you a presentation
of some people who have so little.
well, I must be going.
I can't keep my ecstatic guests waiting.
Oh, no, wait, Emmy will be devastated.
I'm asking you as a friend,
please just stay till the end of her presentation
and act like you're having a good time at my...
interminaball"? Fine.
I'll be stiffly watching from over there By that coat rack.
I have been living in peru for the last six years,
very far from the comforts And the pampered life of neverwood.
for those of you who have a squeamish stomach,
you may want to step out for the sequence entitled "when left untreated.
lights!
and that's when things went really south.
seven years in the jungle In just under seven hours,
just look at the misery in this impoverished village.
here's some more misery.
here I've got a wider angle of the misery.
and just as the birds regurgitate the worms... - things went from bad to worse.
to feed their young,
here we see the tribes members themselves
regurgitating the birds they've eaten To feed their families.
steve was trying to be a friend,
but he was the only one.
this is a nightmare.
I honestly think you're the only one I can count on as a friend to stick around
you're a balloon!
and then came slide 279.
and so once the weights have been released,
Makunta now sports the pagantu of a man And not the pacunca of a boy.
unfortunately, this one did get infected.
no, no, no, Lights! Lights!
what the hell are you doing?
we are at a party.
no, we're not.
the party's over. There is no party.
well, I hope you're not blaming me for that.
of course I am.
you drove everybody out with slide 279.
it's not my fault if your friends didn't like your party.
of course it's your fault.
I turned myself inside out trying to convince everybody
that this awful party was somehow ironic.
I don't even know what that means!
neither do I, but it happened.
you asked me to do this.
you're the one who wanted to totally change me.
you wanted me in this fancy dress,
so what, I'd fit in with your rich friends
and your fine wines and your fancy breakfasts
and your stupid, big, giant...
Oh, you're not gonna be able to
wow, you are really not tired.
I get a lot of sleep.
well, I guess we were the couple who lost it at the party.
I'm just happy that you're willing To refer to us as a couple now.
I'm not. - I'm kidding. Come on.
I'm sorry.
I think I am still intimidated to be here.
it doesn't matter how many years I've been away.
the second I get back here, it's like I'm the housekeeper's daughter again.
it just brings out the worst in me.
I feel really bad that I ruined Your wonderful party for no good reason
for no good reason.
you didn't ruin it.
honestly, I've never even had fun at these things.
maybe if I'd had you to...
hang out with after?
Yeah.
I'm asking you to change.
so maybe I need to be open To changing a little bit as well.
maybe I need to learn to have a little bit of fun.
I love this idea.
in many ways, I prefer it to me becoming less fun.
what do you say We head over to fa'ad's and have a drink?
I would love that. That'd be a lot of fun.
after all, you sat through half a slideshow About the real Emmy Kadubic.
I should go to a party That shows me the real Steven Wilde.
you're telling me there's another half Of the slideshow that's all about you?
man, I want to learn more.
Hey, lights.
my name is Melinda Gordon.
I'm married.
I live in a small town.
and I own an antique shop.
I might be just like you.
except that, from the time I was a little girl.
I knew that I could talk to the dead.
it's all right, honey.
earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.
they're stuck here because they have unfinished business with the living and they come to me for help.
in order to tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.
that looks great on you. With a top hat and a whip, fabulous.
if you need help getting out of that, I'm right over here.
God, I love Halloween.
my parents use to make such a big deal out of it.
when I was a kid, they used to decorate the house up like this big movie set.
it was so great.
were your parents into Halloween?
um, my mother hated it.
I don't know how my father felt.
Oh, why not?
he left when I was little.
I'm so sorry. - No, it's ok.
you know what? I think this table would look nicer next to the window.
can you help me? - Oh, sure.
has anyone in your family died recently?
what?
your extended family. It's pretty much intact?
Yeah. Amazingly long-lived, my family.
both of my grandmothers are still alive, and I have a great-great uncle who's 102.
Wow. Amazing! Everyone's still alive.
Hey, do you want to see the great undead lipstick that I got for Halloween?
sure. - Let me show you.
Oh, by the way, I am judging the pumpkin-carving contest at the school tonight.
you want to come?
I would, but I have plans with a friend.
Oh, well, friends are good. The more, the merrier.
she's not in a position to come, but thanks.
OK.
I swear I put it in here.
I don't know why I couldn't just tell her I was coming here.
I mean, Delia's a really nice person.
she's got a good sense of humor.
maybe it's just kind of hard to talk about.
I miss you so much, Andrea.
you will always be my best friend.
save a little piece of that light for me, ok?
ghosts! Ghosts! Ghosts! Ghosts!
this is wrong. - What's wrong?
this.
who are you? - This is wrong.
where am I? - Look, I know that you're confused.
it's only been a couple of months.
not me. - Excuse me?
I can't be here. I can't be.
Yes, you are here. I just saw you come out of that grave.
but it's not mine.
are you saying?
help me. I'm in the wrong grave.
can you see us?
so, a cemetery. It seems like a natural place for a ghost.
no, actually, it's not. Ghosts get their energy from the living.
there's more ghosts in a shopping mall than at a cemetery.
that explains all the lousy parking.
ghosts tend to go where the problem lies, and this ghost's problem is the cemetery.
how does someone get buried in the wrong grave?
hmm. Makes you wonder what they're doing at those mortuaries.
Oh, you don't want to know that.
no, I really don't.
so, assuming this guy is right, does that mean that the wrong body's in his grave?
makes sense. - Then what could I do about it?
not much, unless you can find the family.
I mean, they can order an exhumation.
you're going to need a lot more evidence than, um, "I talked to a ghost."
makes you wonder how they didn't know it was that guy.
the body must have been pretty messed-up.
Yeah. It was pretty bad.
cold? - No. It's just kind of creepy.
my work is usually on a higher plane. I'm not so used to the whole dead body thing.
you want to try getting used to the live body thing?
Ooh, that sounds nice.
I don't want to do much talking here.
go. Go!
go away! I'm not him!
stop it!
excuse me?
wow, stop this weather!
something like this happens every time I come here.
I think it's his way of telling me he knows I'm here.
that's a really nice way to think about it.
you look familiar to me. Have we met?
my name is Melinda Gordon.
I own an antique shop in town, same as it never was.
Yes, I love that place.
I bought a vase there last year from one of your employees.
lovely girl.
Yeah.
I'm Shelby Burris.
and this is my husband Steve.
I'm so sorry.
they say it gets better with time, but it doesn't seem to.
no, it doesn't.
he was kind and caring. He loved to laugh.
he sounds like a wonderful man.
were you actually there when they buried him?
did you get to say good-bye and see him one last time?
only in spirit.
there was so much damage, it had to be a closed coffin.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
it's ok. It's better to talk about it than keep it bottled up inside.
it was nice to meet you, Melinda.
I didn't ask, do you have a loved one buried here?
Yes.
the lovely girl from the store.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
life is so fleeting, isn't it?
you can be happy, things are going great, and then...
a sudden bolt of lightning can wipe it all out.
Yeah, that's true.
well, life is for the living, right?
what are you doing here?
that woman. She comes every day. She cries so hard...
but not for me.
is that why you're trying to get rid of her?
she thinks that you're her husband.
but I'm not.
who are you? - Godfrey.
do you know how you died?
it was a flash.
bright, hot.
I just--I don't-- I don't know.
I know that this is hard, and you feel really confused right now, but it's going to get better.
do you have a family? Anyone who can help us?
I was alone. I was always alone.
find my grave.
please.
wow, Adam Godfrey's a writer.
what's that?
Oh, sorry. Nothing.
Adam Godfrey? Great writer.
haven't you ever read<Lost Delusions> ?
honey, I saw you look right at me yesterday.
don't pretend you can't see me now.
I cannot talk.
sorry. I just had to cash her out. Did you need me?
no, no. I'm just looking for this book, < Lost Delusions >.
Oh, yeah. Our book club read that last year. Great book.
but the author was kind of a one-hit wonder, right?
well, let's see.
we all read it 3 or 4 times.
we tried to get the country club to name a sandwich after the main character.
it's about a young man struggling to find his ace in the world and failing miserably. Depressing, yet oddly uplifting.
Yep, that's the one.
I still have it at home, if you want to borrow it.
by the way, are you hungry? Because I am starved.
I totally lost track of time. Please go to lunch. I'll cover for you.
did you and Andrea ever just close up for a bit and go and have lunch together?
you know what? I-I can't, because I have an errand to run, so maybe some other time.
Hi. - Oh. Hi.
what are the chances? Twice in 2 days.
well, not so strange for me. I come every day.
can I ask you a question?
does the name Adam Godfrey mean anything to you?
no. Should it?
I just thought maybe he was one of your husband's friends.
steve had so many friends. How would I know him?
um, he was a writer. He's passed away now.
I'm sorry. I don't remember him.
if I do, I'll let you know.
can I ask you how your husband died?
Yeah. I thought I told you. A bolt of lightning.
what?
I know it sounds crazy, but that's how he died.
he was struck by lightning.
lightning? - That's what she said, but my ghost said that he died, and then there was a big flash of light.
and so?
so, what if they both died from some sort of electrical shock?
is it possible that they're psychically connected in some way, or that their souls have swapped bodies?
you know, I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but that's crazy.
right. It is. I'm listening to myself say it, and it sounds crazy.
then again, why not? It's almost Halloween.
it's true. My grandmother always said that the veil between the living and the dead got thinner around Halloween.
the only way to prove something like that...
would be if you found where the other body was, right?
Yes, and then I could talk to the ghost.
but I have searched the internet, and I can't find anything on Adam Godfrey's death.
I even checked with his publishers.
Oh, yeah? What did they say?
clueless. They didn't even know he was dead.
wait a minute. You didn't tell them, did you?
how I can I? I can't prove it.
tricky.
now, Steve Burris, on the other hand, I did find something on him. His obituary.
and he is nothing like Adam at all.
listen to this. A staple on the social circuit with a taste for luxury, adventure, and the good life.
and your guy was a hermit, huh? It's not as if their paths were to cross very often.
coming.
Hey, Jim. I hope it's not too late for visitors.
not at all.
Hey, Delia, come on in.
Oh, I'd love to, but I really just wanted to drop this book by on my way home.
it's a little dark, but guess I like that kind of thing.
me, too. Thanks.
you sure you don't want to stay? We're about to dig into dessert.
dessert? I'd die for something chocolate.
Oh, dear. It sounds great, but I really should get home.
Ned accidentally agreed to let me watch a movie that has no murder, mayhem, or violent explosions in it, so I'd like to watch as much of it as I can before he realizes his mistake.
boring.
OK, then. We'll see you tomorrow.
OK.
Hey! - Are you ok?
Yeah. Gosh, I'm such a klutz today. Bye.
can't I just see what's for dessert?
it's not like I'm worried about trans fats anymore.
wait a minute. Was she accompanied?
Yep. And her ghost is a chocoholic.
I really don't know what I'm going to do about that.
I knew it.
Hey, listen to this dedication.
to Jean, without whose loving support this book could not have been written.
sounds like a wife to me.
you know, he told me that he was alone-- always alone.
maybe she abandoned him.
you're a hopeless romantic, you know that?
OK. There is a Jean Godfrey who owns jean's pet shop in sunset park.
what do you think- man or a woman?
only one way to find out.
you know what? It's fun to brainstorm this stuff with you.
you know, I read somewhere.
ghost busting keeps a marriage strong.
Oh, I can't! No, I can't.
honey, are you all right?
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.
I just promised my husband that I wouldn't come home with something soft and fluffy and--oh.
Oh, yeah. Well, the reptile section's right over there, if that's any help.
actually, I am looking for a human being.
you're looking at her.
Oh, oh, hi. I'm Melinda Gordon?
are you related to the writer Adam Godfrey?
well, if being married to him counts as related.
he's your husband? - Was, long time ago.
I kept the name, though. So why do you ask?
I'm so sorry. He's dead.
Oh, ok.
Tony, could you take the counter, please?
let's talk outside.
sorry, but I really have to do this.
I'm not going to light it, I just go through the motions.
quitting's a bitch.
that's what I hear.
so Adam's dead.
how did it happen?
there was an accident. I don't have all the details.
you the girlfriend?
no. I just met him recently.
he told me that he'd always been alone.
well, I guess he kind of was, actually, even when we were married.
Yeah. It was really good at first. It was just...
he was kind of a hard guy to get close to.
so I assume you've read<Lost Delusions> .
it was pretty much the story of his life.
tortured young guy too smart for his own good, doesn't really fit in.
I guess I thought that I was going to be the one to bring him in from the cold.
you know what? Don't ever think that you can save those tortured young artists.
I think that they actually like being tortured. It's what makes them artists.
he was successful for a while, though, right?
Oh, yeah. When<Lost Delusions> came out, it was a big deal.
and then his second novel came out.
critics had a feeding frenzy.
Adam was devastated and he said he needed to move to the cabin to have some isolation to write.
at first, he came home every weekend, then once a month, and then there was the talk.
the one where you know it's all over.
if you want someone reliable, you get yourself a pet.
thanks for the advice.
Yeah. Thank you for letting me know about this.
Oh, man.
this is going to be really hard for Kate to hear.
Kate? - His daughter.
Yeah. Death can be hard to explain to children.
well, she's hardly a child. She's a junior at state U.
she hasn't seen or heard from her father since she was 3.
3? - She'd never admit it, but I think that she always thought that she'd see him again.
hell, maybe even get an explanation.
well, that's not going to happen now, is it?
well, thanks. I just...
I wanted to let you know.
what are you doing here? - I'm not sure.
I feel like I'm near something that used to be important.
I need to talk to you.
why didn't you tell me that you had a wife and daughter?
a wife and daughter?
no, I didn't have a wife and...
Oh, my god.
Jean and Kate.
Yeah, Jean and Kate, who you abandoned when she was 3.
why would I do that? - That's what I'd like to know.
all I know is I had a lot of demons. It was hard being around people.
I think I felt that I wasn't good for either of them.
so you ditched them?
no, I freed them to lead happier lives without me.
what? - That's classic.
you don't understand. - No, you don't understand.
how do you think your daughter felt when she had to watch you walk out of her life forever?
free? You're her father.
it was complicated. I'm not proud of it.
good,'cause you don't deserve to be happy.
you deserve to be exactly where you are-- in the wrong grave, doomed to listen to a woman grieve a good man, knowing that he isn't you.
so anyway, I'm standing in this alley, and I'm yelling at this ghost.
why did I let myself get so emotional?
not gonna read it, huh?
I don't want anything to do with this ghost.
why would I help someone who would run out on his family, abandoning his child?
whose family are we talking about now?
OK, I admit it, I have a personal thing going on here. So what?
so nothing. Just know where it's coming from.
and then he had the nerve to expect me to make it right for him.
in his defense, there aren't too many other people he could go to.
you're defending him?
I'm pointing out you're a little emotional right now.
I don't have to help every ghost that comes along. It's my call, right?
I mean, you've heard me tell ghosts to leave me alone.
only when you thought you couldn't help them.
you really think I can help this one?
Yeah, I do. And I think you do, too.
I can't talk about this right now. I have a headache.
Ooh, that's fabulous.
is it for sale?
Oh, no, I'm sorry. It's mine.
Lucy and Ethel would die for that bag.
may I?
Oh, sure.
there you go.
careful with that clasp, liberace. You trying to break it?
Ow. There must be a pin sticking out of it somewhere.
I don't see it.
OK. Thank you so much, and please come back again soon.
I will. You girls have great taste.
that really is a nice bag. I haven't noticed it before.
Yeah. I got it a couple of days ago at an estate sale.
Ah. That explains a lot.
you know, there are some figurines in the back. Could you go and get them for me?
you might have to dig around a little bit.
sure, no problem.
so it's the bag.
of course it's the bag. I don't even know that woman.
what's your name? - Marilyn Mandeville.
why are you the only one who can see me?
it's a long story. So how did you die, Marilyn?
I was at a charity event, one of those horrible things where no one can remember the charity, but they all sure as hell know where the photographers are.
well, I wasn't in the mood to be in the papers.
I knew I looked all red and blotchy from crying over luca.
Luca? - My boyfriend.
hot-headed, bad-tempered, just this much dangerous.
all the things I love in a man.
anyway, a friend told me that she saw him out with another woman, so...
I kicked him out of the house.
Aha. React first, ask questions later.
but I loved him.
anyway, I was just about to leave the party, when suddenly I saw him across the room.
he saw me, too.
he wrote something down on a napkin. He gave it to a waiter to give to me.
I tell you, my heart was pounding so hard, I thought everybody could hear it.
well, what did it say?
I didn't want to look desperate to read it.
so I tucked it in my bag.
I finished my drink and then I practically knocked over tables and chairs to get outside to read it.
but then...
you died.
heart attack.
I never got to read the note.
Marilyn, I hate to tell you this, but the chances of that note still being in the bag.
please, will you just check?
God! The interruptions in this place.
Shelby. Hi.
I just had to come by because the strangest thing happened to me.
you asked me if I knew a man named Adam Godfrey, right?
right.
well, he just called me. - What?
I was just about to have dinner when the phone rang.
I said hello, but all I heard was silence and a click.
I looked down at the caller I. D. And it said Adam Godfrey.
but didn't you say that Adam Godfrey died?
Yes, I did.
that's what I thought, so I wrote the number down.
Melinda, you may find this hard to believe, but I think your friend is trying to reach you from the afterlife.
I didn't think you'd come back.
I didn't plan to.
well, I'm glad you did.
I have one question and I want you to be really honest.
how do you walk away from your family?
you tell yourself your daughter will never feel the loss.
she won't miss you because she never knew you.
your wife will find love somewhere else and be better off.
you tell yourself that your work will be the thing that lives on after you, and that's what's important.
well, maybe you needed to learn this, Adam.
that guy whose grave I'm in...
he was really loved.
he must have been a good man.
Shelby thought so.
the woman who's been crying at his grave, the one you called to reach me.
I--I didn't call that woman. - You didn't?
who knew I could even use a phone? I'm dead.
does this number look familiar to you?
that's my phone number at the cabin.
do you remember where this is?
I think so. Why?
because somebody's in this cabin and I think we should find out who it is.
does this road look familiar to you?
no.
wait a minute... yes.
I was here.
it was late at night and my car had broken down.
no, wait a minute, I was out of gas.
the guy who picked me up, he seemed upset about something.
and I asked him about it, but he wouldn't talk, not until he heard my name.
turns out that he had read lost delusions 4 times, and so he wanted to know all about me.
I told him I lived in a cabin miles away from everything.
but I asked him about himself and he got tense.
"you wouldn't want my life," he said.
he didn't really know his way around, so we stopped at a bar.
I remember the bartender said there was a gas station 3 miles down the road, but my new friend said that he wanted a drink, and so did I.
he said he was a businessman who--who had the golden touch, at least until lately, and now things were going sour, he couldn't catch a break.
and he got some inside information about something, like a big merger.
gambled everything he had left on it, and it tanked.
now I remember. He said that his wife didn't know anything about this.
I can't tell her...
and he said he couldn't stand to see her have to give up the life that they had.
all that he had left was this insurance policy.
I'm worth more dead than alive.
this guy, he was so in love with his wife, and I just felt empty.
I never loved anyone like that.
did he tell you his name?
well, if he did, I don't remember.
do you think he killed himself?
looked like he was heading that way.
it was starting to rain, so I decided to cut my losses and walk.
help!
help me! Help!
what are you doing?
and that's how he became you.
that man, he was the name on my tombstone.
and I'm guessing he's in your cabin.
but why would he do that?
why would he throw away everything he had, the woman that he loved?
why not? It's what you did, wasn't it?
this is it? - This is it.
yes? - Who are you?
who are you? - I'm Kate Godfrey.
who are you?
my daughter.
you're Adam's daughter.
put it this way-- he's half the reason I was born.
second time, who are you?
sorry. Melinda Gorden. I live in Grandview, and I know your father.
you're the one that told my mother he was dead.
Yes.
well, that was helpful of you, considering it's not true.
what does that mean?
Oh, I'm sorry, can I come in?
it's not my place.
So...What makes you think that he's not dead?
no accident report, no body, no obituary.
do you want me to go on?
no, I'd look for them, too.
so not finding them it makes sense you think he's dead.
I know he is.
look, I know that this is gonna sound hard to believe。
I'm sure it will.
I've spoken to your father's spirit.
Oh, wow, you're one of those.
please believe me. It's true.
I know my father attracted some eccentric fans, but this takes it to a whole new level.
do you know much about your father?
no. I've never even read his books. - Why not?
it was the great god of literature that made him leave us.
frankly, I'm not interested.
Kate, your father gave me every detail about what happened to him the night that he died.
I'd be happy to tell you if you like.
do you know what I'd like? Is for you to leave me alone.
my mother tells me she hears from you that he's dead.
she asks me to come here and gather his effects, I come out here and what do I find?
a full fridge.
cigarettes in the ash tray. Newly opened mail.
dead, my ass.
I just hope I can get out of here before he comes back.
Kate...the man who's been living here, his name is Steve Burris.
there was a mix-up the night the night that your father died and he was mistaken for him, but your father is here now.
and he really wants to talk to you if he can just make some peace.
are you aware that you aren't even remotely believable?
Adam, please tell me something that Kate will understand. Help me.
just that she was such a beautiful child.
he thought you were so beautiful.
that's it? Oh, come on. Didn't you do your research?
the name of My Fuzzy Bunny, my favorite pet.
what about a cute nickname? Come on. Make me weep.
I--I can't.
he told me before that the only reason he left was to free you from having him as your father.
he didn't feel like he could give you what you needed, and that you would have a better life without him.
damn straight I did.
look, I know how you feel.
he did a terrible thing, and you've thought about him every day of your life with anger and resentment, I know.
you know? - Yes, I do know, but, Kate, for one minute, just--just imagine that what I'm saying to you is true.
that he's here and that he loves you and he feels really bad about not being in your life.
if you could tell him one more thing, what would it be?
I'd tell him to go to hell.
I'm so sorry.
don't be. She's right.
she did the only thing she could do.
she hardened her heart to me, she got on with her life.
there's no reason she should forgive me. No reason at all.
wow, you should have seen her. She was so bitter, so hard.
is that what I'm like when I talk about my father?
listen, everybody's gotta put the hard shell on, you know?
that means yes.
no, that means no.
you know, I can feel the hurt.
look, the good news is, you overcame the hurt.
helped somebody else and maybe, in the process, you helped yourself.
you always know the right thing to say.
I used to always know the right thing to say.
yesterday you wanted to bite my head off.
Oh...you were saying the right thing yesterday, I just didn't know it.
I can't sleep.
I'm Steve Burris.
are you gonna make trouble for me? I need to know.
you heard me talking to Kate.
I was on my way back from the mailbox when she drove up.
I stayed by the side of the house waiting for her to leave, and then you came.
that stuff you told her, how did you know all that?
Adam told me.
right. I heard that whole bit about how you talk to the dead.
come on, tell me the truth. How did you really know?
I wasn't lying. Adam told me about the night that he ran out of gas.
how you picked up, you told him about your money troubles, and you told him that you would be worth more dead than alive.
no one knew that.
he said he was killed in the storm, and that you stole his wallet so that you could fake your death. Now he's in your grave.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know what else to do.
I was on the verge of suicide, and...
when this happened, it seemed the only answer.
you found him.
he found me.
Adam's here now.
please...
if he's really here, make him understand I was desperate.
tell him I know, I've been there, but this isn't the way to go.
he says he understands, but this isn't the answer.
you can't just leave him in the wrong grave.
he has to hear Shelby crying everyday.
Shelby cries?
for me?
tell him he's lucky. I threw away the people who love me.
Adam only wishes he could have had what you have.
but he told me . he needed to be free. I understood that.
that's what I wanted, too!
no, it's not freedom, I was wrong.
he was wrong. He doesn't feel free. He feels...
very, very, sad.
and he wants you tell Shelby that you're alive.
I can't. She'll-- she'll never forgive me.
you gotta risk it. Look at all the other risks you took.
he says you have to risk it.
and tell him I forgive him for the rest.
and he forgives you for the rest of it.
he does?
he does.
Steve... she will, too.
you should feel good about what you said to him.
even if nothing comes of it, you're a good man.
that's nice of you to say, even if we both know it isn't true.
Melinda? Hi, I got your message.
Um...yes, there's something that I have to tell you.
OK, the night that Steve died, you said that he was alone, and that's not really true. It isn't?
how do you know?
my friend, the one that I was telling you about, Adam Godfrey, he was with him that night.
he was? But you said he's dead.
he is. He died that night.
but they only found one body.
I know. And it wasn't Steve's.
it was Adam's.
Melinda, what are you trying to tell me?
what I'm trying to tell you is...
what I'm trying to tell you is to look over there.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! Steve!
you're alive!
Oh, Shelby, I missed you so much.
how is this possible? What happened?
Oh, my god, I'm seeing your face again! I love you so much!
Shelby, I have a lot to tell you. I've done something you're not gonna like, it's something bad.
there's gonna be lawsuits and trouble.
I don't care, I don't care!
as long as you're alive!
thank you.
in my version, he'd probably drop dead of a heart attack as soon as they left the cemetery.
I don't think so, I read your book.
you did?
I did. Last night, it was beautiful.
and I can understand why the writer would need to live alone.
I'm not sure I understand.
you need to forgive yourself a little.
she'll never come, will she? My daughter.
she'll never visit her father's grave.
you never know. - Yes, I do.
this is one story that won't have a happy ending.
look, Adam, I'm not your daughter...
but I guess you've noticed that I have some issues of my own.
but you know what? If I was as your daughter, I would...
I would find it in my heart to forgive you.
Why?
maybe it's because I read your book.
or maybe it's because I realize that everybody has their own story.
and you just don't know it.
so how's your story going to end?
happy.
it's all you can ask for, right, is a happy ending.
no...
don't tell me it really exists.
it does.
well, I'll be damned.
actually, that's not the idea.
but...why do i get to see it?
I mean, I pretty much failed on every level of my life.
because you found some peace.
at least a little bit. Am I wrong?
no. You're not wrong.
thank you.
you're very welcome.
Damn!
what happened?
I tripped over this bag again and I twisted my ankle.
stuff like that has been happening to me for the past 3 days.
well, maybe it's the curse of that pirate outfit you're wearing.
look, I am going to a great Halloween party. Do you want to come?
Ugh, no. I'm gonna go home, take a hot bath, and think about anything but ghosts.
you know, I don't get you. Ghosts and spooks are fun.
Yeah.
will you do me a favor?
sell this bag. Ever since I got it, I have had the worst luck.
I thought you didn't believe in anything like that.
Yeah, well, I don't. Just shows you how desperate I am.
I will be happy to sell it for you.
Hey, Delia, tomorrow why don't we close up and go to lunch together?
sounds good. - Happy Halloween.
about time. I thought I'd never get rid of that girl. Now, look inside.
I don't see a note. - Check the lining.
nothing.
there's a little rip in the lining. You have to feel around.
all right!
I found it!
Oh, I'm so sorry, Marilyn.
I don't you're gonna like what this has to say.
what? What does it say?
rip my heart out, why don't you.
he still loved me. Luca still loved me!
it's what we said to each other after every break-up when we got back together.
rip my heart out, why don't you.
it meant everything was going to be ok now.
Oh...I get it.
Oh, I really have to find him now.
Oh, let me stop you right there--you don't want to do that.
do you see a light?
Yes.
Yeah, well then, you should go into it and wait for him.
that could take a long time.
it won't seem that long. Trust me.
go. Wait for him to rip your heart out.
sorry! I ran out of candy a couple of hours ago.
Bye.
5 signs death will come...
hide it, hide it. It's fresh bread. - Oh, thank you.
be careful, hide it, I don't want my father to know.
please, give me some bread. - You, be quiet!
I want some! I want some! - Quiet!
EvangeIisti! EvangeIisti!
EvangeIisti, will you sell me some cheese? - My name isn't Evangelisti, it's De Santis.
they told me you are EvangeIisti and sell cheese? - We are of the Evangelist religion.
what does that mean?
nothing, only we live by the Gospel. - What about the cheese, do you sell it?
well, no, but I can give you some, - What's wrong with that sheep? - That sheep is going to be a mother any minute now.
such a small one! - You want two?
how much for one? - 1, 000 lires each one. - Is it gold?
better, it's hard to eat gold, but cheese you can eat.
does the Gospel teach you to ask such prices? - If you don't want it...
before, I could have bought a house with this.
don't take it, Signora. If you take it at my price, you'll be mad at me, and if I sell it at your price I'll be mad at you.
gospel wants men love each other.
you're worse than all them. - Peace, little sister.
if you want a lamb for Easter, let me know. - No, you won't cheat me anymore.
good.
it's good.
good.
where could I find flour? - Who has flour.
if Rosetta gets sick, I'll get a knife then you'll see flour!
one of these days we'll go see the peasants with guns! Then we refugees will get flour.
that's the way! - If you ever do that, I will kill you!
who's talking to you? - He doesn't understand, he doesn't have children.
what are you teaching the children? - You want to teach me?
go back to your mother! - You try it and see if I don't do what I say!
I thought you'd left. - I'm leaving soon. - Where? - Down.
we haven't seen you lately. - I'll walk with you to Fondi.
are you crazy? The Germans will shoot you. - There's a friend there who might sell us food.
you mustn't risk it. - Something could happen to you.
you don't know me very well. If a German gets too close...
what's the world coming to? Horses eating grain!
Via!
they were eating grain. - Please do not be afraid. I'm not German.
you're Russian. - Russian, traitor.
you seem like Ukrainian girl. Ukrainian eyes, beautiful.
is the road safe? - You can go.
last days for Germans. For me too, I think.
he's beautiful! Is he really a Russian? - A deserter.
they never tell you that they make them like that in Russia!
can you tell me where I can buy some sugar, flour...
some tinned food, some honey, little sugar? You know, anything you can get.
if I tell you, you won't tell the Germans where I've hidden my food?
I swear I won't tell anyone.
the last time, do you know what I said? "I have nothing." And they said: "Oh, you have nothing?."
ta, ta, ta, ta, ta...
you can have this milk, if you like. I don't need it anymore. What for?
they killed Gaetanino, my baby. Who will I give it to?
you want it? Who wants milk?
who wants my milk?
hurry up, hurry up!
Michele, where did you come from? - Sant'Eufemia, everyone's all right.
this is a friend of ours, a refugee. - Please, Signora, come in.
this way.
these are old friends. This is the commander of the German anti-aircraft station.
Michele!
Cesira, a friend of the family. - Sit down. - Help yourselves.
may I ask you how it is that you managed to procure this loaf of bread?
a soldier made us a present of it and we gave him a present. You know, it's wartime...
an exchange, in other words. - That's right.
that's forbidden. Who was the soldier?
I will go and make the coffee. - I'll give you a hand.
sit down. - I'll help you, I'll help you.
Michele, eat some cake.
your occupation? - I'm a graduate.
and what did you study? - Literature.
I studied philosophy at the university of Rome.
then you can understand how we Italians can take whatever happens to us philosophically.
no, I don't. In Italy there are many things I find confusing, especially the great class distinctions.
people like you who have everything and your peasants have nothing.
this is not our usual daily meal. My mother... cooked it in your honor.
yesterday I went to look at some of your peasants... Like swine, dear sir, they all live like swine.
you don't understand, they live that way because they want to!
you! You are the leaders of Italy! It's your fault!
and please, you won't hush me with one dinner! I speak the truth.
mamma mia!
we have to stay on the right side of him. He eats here every Saturday afternoon.
I'd poison his soup!
we Germans are devoted to the truth! - Do you think you're the only ones, because you're not.
I think you Germans will be surprised when you find out the truth is not only your property.
he always drinks more than one bottle, always. - Excuse me. - Eat whatever you want.
may I take some leftovers? - Take what you want.
now what? - He always make him sing. - Could I have some sugar?
and some flour?
you... and Michele...
the coffee!
grind it for me. - Sure.
you Germans have war in their blood. - War?
war, my dear friend, is an experience without which a man cannot say he is a man.
if that's true, I would rather be castrated.
that is the way all you Italians feel, and so we are forced to waste valuable men here.
it is not true, you were beaten before you started.
Ach, instead of dreaming, put in your heads,
you and all the rest of you Italians, you will have to pay the price of your faults!
pay! Pay! You understand? And your children will have to pay with bitter tears!
what have the children got to do with it? - Tell me.
we met a woman driven crazy by you, but you won't drive me crazy! - Don't listen to her! She's only a woman.
Oh, let's get out, let's get out! - Hurry, Mama!
God help us all! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, help me! - Okay Mama, just hurry.
Cesira, come!
I can't see! I can't see!
what are you doing?
if Rosetta had seen us, we'd have made a pretty picture.
you know what? I think you're old enough to have a new hairdo.
I'd like you to do my hair like yours, Mama. - I'll try.
you're two inches taller since we are here.
I'm going into the mountains. Good-bye.
and how you'll arrive there? - I'll be all right.
take care. What are you going to do? - Something good.
so long, Rosetta. - Will we see you, in Rome?
maybe I'll send you some books anyway.
you have our address? - I'll be able to find you two, don't worry.
Hey, come and see! There are Germans in the haystack! They're retreating!
in a few days we'll leave!
you will give us something to eat.
I said you will give us something to eat! - Here nobody has anything. We are hungry ourselves.
I gave an order.
we better do something. Get him some bread, go on.
we need one of you to come with us to show us the quickest way. We have to get down to the next valley.
you - I'm not from here. I don't know these hills - He doesn't know.
you then.
anyone here can tell you that we are from Ceprano. We are just refugees.
we need water.
water, hurry up! - Somebody get some water!
hurry up!
come on, run!
you will hand me that bread! We are the mad dogs!
you come with us. - He's my son!
my son doesn't know these mountains. He reads, he is a student! He studies the Bible!
move or I'll fire.
pick me. Pick me! I know these hills.
I'll show you the fastest way over.
I'll go, Mama. I'll go.
come on, let's go! There's a long way to go.
you are an old man, I want the young one. It's a duty.
don't worry about me, I'll be back before tonight.
Bye, Mama. I'll be back.
my son! Michelino!
he'll come back, don't worry.
forward.
the Americans are coming! Look the Americans! - Michele understood the situation so he cut back through the valley. He's waiting in Fondi.
I'm sure. - But Michele was supposed to come back here.
michele knew what would happen. When the American army broke through, he knew we would all leave.
and he would be right, everybody is leaving.
come on, FiIippo. - I'll put your things on a mule.
let's go together and see what happened to Michele. - Signora, in a few days you'll be in Rome.
Paride, come here! Luisa wants you! - I'll be right back.
stay here with your wife, we'll be all right. - It always takes her all day to have a baby.
some are born, and some die.
michele has a head on his shoulders. He won't be fooled by those Germans!
come on, let's go.
everything is over! Everything is over!
I still don't know whether the shelling is American or German.
the Germans are on the run. If the Allies keep this up, soon they chase them up to Milan.
can we go back to Rome? - A matter of hours. - It'll take longer than that.
don't they have to liberate us? Look! The Americans!
Ehi, Signorina! Signorina!
Signora Cesira. - What does he want?
he asked you to show your legs. Because he wants to take your picture. - Ask your sister!
I'm sorry, she won't.
we can't get to Fondi. They're all bombing all along the road.
we have to wait until the Americans have gone through.
we are from the next village, just a short way down the road. - God be with you.
may the Virgin protect you.
mama, what can we do? - FiIippo, I want to know about my boy. Let's go- Yes, you're right.
Paride, I think we have got to go to Fondi. Michele might be waiting.
mama, come on! - My angel, it's a mess!
this is no time to go to Fondi. I'm going back to Sant'Eufemia. - Not for me, no!
we left too soon. - Let's go.
good bye. - Good luck.
wait, be careful, Maria.
take my arm.
let me know about Michele! - They're all out of their minds. They'll be right in the middle of the bombing!
good-bye, Signora. - Good-bye.
Bye, Rosetta. - Good-bye.
Signora, come with us. - No, no, good-bye.
come on, let's go! Look at the crazy girl!
what's Michele to you? Father, brother, what? Come one or I'll smack you!
are you coming or not? Rose!
hurry up, Rosetta! I want to go back to Rome, understand?
run!
damn you!
let's go.
you won't get back to Rome?
want to eat something?
Yes.
here.
I wonder who they are. - They're Allies, Mama.
come, let's find some shade.
Oh, my legs!
feel like taking a little nap? - Yes.
all right, lay down.
want this off? - No, no.
Rosetta.
Rosetta. - What? - Did you see? We'd better out of here!
Rosetta!
run, Rosetta, run!
Rosetta!
mama!
Rosetta!
mamma!
Rosetta.
sweet angel.
do you think you can walk? - Yes.
Rosetta.
Rosetta.
do you know what they have done those "heroes" that you command?
do you know what your great soldiers have done in a holy church under the eyes of the madonna? Do you know?
peace, peace.
Yes, peace, beautiful peace! You ruined my little daughter forever!
now she's worse than dead. No, I'm not mad, I'm not mad!
look at her! And tell me if I am mad!
rotten crazy bastards!
Rosetta.
Rosetta!
Rosetta!
Rosetta.
wait, let me help you.
are you in pain, my daughter? - No.
baby, please speak to me. - What is there to say?
you seem angry with me, sweet angel. You must be strong.
tomorrow we'll be in our house, I'm sure of it.
we'll find a place to sleep and leave tomorrow.
what's the use? - What's the use? You'll drive me mad.
we've been through terrible things together. This will pass. - Mama, don't talk about it anymore.
come on, sweet angel. We left our things up on the road. Someone might steal them.
come.
come, my angel come.
why don't you lean on me? Come on, Rose.
you had nothing to do with those Moroccans? - I told you no.
at Vallecorsa this morning they raped half the village.
if they touched my sister, I would killed them all.
where will you drop us? - After Fondi.
if you want to stop at any place my mother has an extra bed. - We are on our way to Rome.
it's too dangerous. Wait a few days, let the Americans go first.
you like to dance?
to dance!
well, then, what about the girl?
you...you like to dance? - Leave her alone, she's not even 13!
what's the difference? My regular girl's only 15. Girls grow up quick around here.
tonight we're going to throw a little victory party. - Tonight we have to get some sleep.
who wants to sleep? I want to enjoy myself.
don't you like to sing, kid?
Yes. -Then come on, let's sing!
that's it, beautiful, sing!
Rosetta?
Rosetta!
the dress!
Rosetta.
Rosetta!
what's the matter, Signora? - Signora, what is it?
she might have gone to Fondi to look for Michele.
out all alone like this at night! She must have gone to Fondi!
how far? How far is it from here to Fondi? - I'll take you there, Signora. It will only take us half an hour.
but why, why didn't she tell me?
all right let's go to Fondi, to FiIippo's grocery, Michele's father. - I'll just go get my shoes on.
they killed FiIippo's son.
they found him up in the hills tonight.
Michele.
sure it was Michele?
that's right. A friend of mine saw the Germans shoot him.
his mother is dying of sorrow!
Signora, your daughter she's out with my son, my FIorindo.
where? - Not far, they went dancing. - Where are they? - Not far, I told you!
what kind of a pig is your son? She's only a little girl, I'm going to kill your rotten son!
if she went out with him, she wanted too. No one forced her.
what's happened to her, God.
what have I done wrong? Tell me what I have done wrong...
she'll come back. Go to bed.
why didn't you tell me what you were going to do? - You were asleep.
you two arranged this before last night - Yes.
who gave you these? - FIorindo.
and what for? - To wear.
to wear? - Sure.
don't you ever say "sure" to me like that!
do you hear? You will not put those stockings on! You will not put them on!
you will not! Now I'm going to smack his face, that dirty pig!
she doesn't even cry...
too stupid.
he was right, Michele.
escape, escape...
but you can escape from this...
you haven't even asked about Michele.
he's dead. Michele!
mamma.
angel...
sweet angel.
forgive me.
please forgive me.
stop it, Rosetta, please.
come here, Rose. Come, sweet angel.
please stop crying, please.
please, Rosetta, please...
please, Rosetta.
my sweet angel.
sleep.
my angel, my angel.
sleep.
sleep.
sleep.
bombs! - They're bombing us!
Rosetta!
Rosetta! Rosetta!
Oh, my God, she's going to die! Arnaldo, get me some water.
will you get me a glass of water!
Rosetta!
Signora...
please, Rosetta. Try to drink some water.
it's all over, they are gone. We'll be all right. Look at me, look at Mamma.
they are gone, drink. Please, drink.
mamma! - Rosetta!
you see, Mamma was right, they are really gone. Please don't cry, my darling.
we've got to close the shop and get out of Rome. But don't cry.
it's all over. They're gone.
if I was a man, I would shoot them all! They're dirty murderers!
want me to open up? - Sure, sure!
I can't. It's all out of shape. - It's all over, Rosetta. You can thank the good Lord
Madonna, look at the smoke! That's my house!
Arnaldo, what's happened? They hit one of the houses down the street.
a lot of smoke from the Tiburtino! Here the ledge over the door came down.
"his Imperial Majesty has arranged to give the governor of Rome a relief fund of one million lire."
who, the Pope? - Of course not.
"his Imperial Majesty arranged to give the governor of Rome ..."
"all the people Count," Sforza said yesterday in his timely speech have welcomed with dignity and
his Holiness, Pope Pius XII has sent a telegram to President Roosevelt...
Giovanni, you've got to help me out.
I want my daughter out of Rome. - It's all right, sit down.
she has a weak heart, I'm afraid she might have an attack.
you'll go where? - Away from Rome!
those lunatics will come again, even the Pope they don't respect.
fine! Then the war will be over sooner, maybe. - Oh, are you crazy or something? We'll all be killed!
what's Mussolini doing? - That's what I'd like to know, that madman!
he's got to say something. - You women will believe anything.
before they came to bomb us, we weren't doing so badly. Business was good.
Oh! Sure, it was. - I'll leave you the keys to the store.
you might look in now and then and check the house, too.
if you trust me... - Sure.
we'll make up an inventory, just between friends.
Buonanni will buy the stuff that might go bad. - I'm sorry you're going.
why don't you get away? - What will I use for money, Cesira?
it would only be for a few weeks, no more. Isn't it? - Sure.
take this to Covelli. Come back in an hour. - Why an hour? - An hour.
if something had happened to Rosetta I would have murdered someone.
who would you have murdered?
I'm wasting your time, Giovanni.
I'd do anything for you.
I know, you were a good friend to my husband.
come on, you were with him then. Did you love him?
I married him. - But you didn't love him!
you make me sick.
I'd like to see you living like I did, sleeping in a shed! And we ate once a day, that's all.
so, I went with the first one that said "I will bring you to Rome." I married Rome, not him.
well, how was it? With an old man?
don't make me think about it.
come on, sit down.
he used to tell me about you, you know.
what did he tell you? - Everything.
Really? - Once when we were out fishing, he told me how you were built. He bragged about it. I felt like shoving him into the water!
he should have told you that for the last two years I slept alone!
and with whom did you sleep?
your mind's a sewer! When you're raising a daughter, you think about other things!
look... didn't you ever want to?
that's my affair.
what are you doing?
there's no business at this hour.
no one's likely to come in.
you can shut what you want, Giovanni. You don't own me after all.
you like me a little bit, don't you?
but think about your wife... - My wife!
I hope a bomb falls on her, then I can marry you.
no, don't, Giovanni. Please, Giovanni.
Oh, Giovanni, be good!
Ah!
did you hurt yourself? - I could murder you!
where did I hurt you? - Here...
here?
Giovanni!
Giovanni, you must never let my daughter know about this - Or else I'll do something crazy. - Sorry about it already?
you better understand that for me nothing at all happened. We are like we were before.
go on. I'll see you tomorrow.
you think you can treat me like that? Nobody can treat me like that! I'm nobody's property!
thanks a lot for the wine!
you'd better put a new lock on the store right away.
don't worry. I said Gaetano. - That's fine.
if there's is anything new, I'll write you. - I can't! I won't write you.
it takes me an hour to write one word!
a postcard's all right... - Maybe you could come see us some Sunday?
I already thought of that. Ciao!
Ciao.
Rosetta, sit down.
listen, Mamma, don't they sing well?
dirty...
who are you angry at, Signora? - Everyone. -I just hate one person...
what are they singing about? - As always, something sad.
it makes you feel so melancholy!
you know who has the right to be melancholy? We Italians!
my daughter was so excited about living that she didn't sleep last night.
that pig!
what is it? Where are we? - Who knows?
they bombed the rails ahead of us. - Am I supposed to walk to Naples?
it will take for or five hours to repair it.
fuck! - You should thank heaven the trains are running!
I'm not thanking anybody, especially not heaven! - That's your affair!
look, that's Mount Forcella.
Where's Sant'Eufemia? - It's over there. We'll walk, we'll get there sooner.
can we get off the train? - Sure, why not?
we'll have to walk many miles. All right? I like to walk, Mamma.
will you hand me down our stuff? - All right, get off, Signora.
Oh, the sack! Where is the sack?
[German accent] Signora, hold on!
thank you. - Please.
when is this war going to end?
we'll get home for Christmas.
Din-don! Din-don!
bells, Christmas and this all will be over.
and who understands you?
he says it will be over by Christmas. - Damn it! Another six months? It's much too long.
tell that to them! - It all will be over at Christmas.
Din-don! Din-don!
here's how you do it, Rosetta. Look.
watch out!
you have to feel it sitting on the middle of your head, Rosetta. Don't keep your neck so stiff.
easy, like this.
I've lost the skill myself, damn it!
Arrivederci!
Arrivederci! - Arrivederci!
those Germans aren't so bad after all. - No, mamma.
what pretty creatures you are! My sons' eyes are popping out of their heads.
Rosario, hurry up with that. When you're through go to the house and get yourself some food and for Luigino some slices of salami.
what time can we leave tomorrow? - Rosario, when do you think the pretty lady can leave?
whenever she wants. I've got the mule. - I made you a good price.
the room for the night was included. - I didn't have any choice!
what? Why are you complaining? I didn't even ask you for any money in advance.
in this time, who knows? I don't know you, pretty lady. - Don't worry, don't worry.
you know what this is? - Jesus, Joseph and Mary!
I never saw so much money before! Rosario, the lady's a bank!
here the Monkey arrive!
what are you doing here, monkey? - You know what we are doing here.
looking for bread? Some wine? - You are trying to be clever. I am cleverer.
where are your sons?
in Albania! They're fighting in the war. Everyone knows that. They're fighting for the King and Mussolini.
of course. Look in there.
who's using this bicycle, Vincenzo? - My poor old husband doesn't have the strength anymore.
I use it. - Sure, why don't we have a race sometime?
who are they? - People from Rome. They're spending the night with me. They're on their way to Sant'Eufemia.
I gave them a bed. We're Christians...
you know that your sons are deserters. And you know that if we catch them we have to shoot?
I say all deserters should be shot!
here's the wine. Now, let's drink to my sons. Drink, monkey!
give it to me.
what's new in Rome, Signora?
they are dropping bigger bombs every day! - Wait a few more weeks, you'll see...
we have decided to get it over with. - Let's hope so. - Stay here in Fondi, Signora.
here you can eat. In Sant'Eufemia, they won't even sell you flour.
that's where I come from. They know me. - We could put you up at headquarters.
you and the girl could help us out. - Especially in the kitchen.
what are you saying? I'm not servant. Not just servant. To help the militia, it's an honor.
and you? You'd like it?
or would you rather go starve with the goats?
keep that for your sister! - Shut up. I'll tell you when to talk.
you tell who when to talk?
keep your hands to yourself, you miserable pig!
stay away from her, or I'll smash your face! - They're respectable people. They're Fascists!
this woman deserves to be shot. - They're women, maybe you'd better leave them alone.
put that rock down. - Do what he says! - Mamma!
we could force you to come to headquarters. Make her understand.
I will talk her into it, Monkey.
Rosetta. Rosetta.
let's go. It will be light any minute. - I'm sleepy! - Damn it!
those men will come back today. I didn't sleep all night.
Rosetta.
mamma.
Oh, mamma mia! Put this on. Quick, quick, quick!
I shouldn't have showed them all my money, they all look like dirty thieves!
with this, we can go where we want. Please, hurry, sweet angel, hurry!
you've never ridden a mule, have you? - Never, mamma.
when I was young, I loved to ride them. I used to hit them to make them go faster.
Hey, where could we get two mules to take us over to Sant'Eufemia?
I don't know. People doesn't move like before. - I can pay.
my daughter had enough walking. - I'm from the next village, Forcella. I can't help you here.
I bet you anything they're on her way to Rome again. Good bye. - Good bye.
you're not scared, are you? - No, Mama, I'm not scared now.
that idiot tried to kill us!
but why, Mama? - Who knows!
let's go. Come on.
we'd better go round this way... - The poor man... - I know, but we couldn't help him, child.
you are Paride. - And you are Cesira.
you still need a shave. - We're not rich like you people in Rome.
this one made a fortune in Rome! You recognize her?
Luisa!
with a son on the way! - He gave me three already!
sit down, Signora. - Sit down, Cesira. - Thank you.
Signora, this is my niece. - Hello.
we're celebrating a miserable day, my wedding anniversary!
come here, Rosetta, come here!
she's my daughter. This air brings back memories. Like when my mother used to say [She speaks dialect]
do you understand me? - I don't. - It means that a person doesn't stand still.
it means: " Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow I'm carrying my heart in a quagmire " .
where is my aunt? - In Naples with her daughter.
Armando? - He's dead.
that's where I was born. It's rented, Signora. I'm waiting for my relatives from Formia.
could you put us up for a month? - I have no room with all this people who are since spring.
I felt at first it was time to escape.
Paride, give them the weaving shed. You can put the loom in your place.
Paride, don't make me beg. Aren't we relatives? - We're all relatives here.
I'm not going back to Rome, nor to Fondi. This morning we almost got ourselves killed. - How?
an airplane. It killed an old man. - We're safe from that here.
we pass the time among friends and we eat. - The English will be here soon.
english or German... who wins, wins. - I'd wish they'd hurry! - Who doesn't?
if the Germans win, I will kill myself.
what have they done to you anyway? - To me personally, nothing.
and then? - So, enough politics. Eat some more. And you play!
what would you like to hear? He used to have an orchestra in Fondi. - Here he plays for nothing.
play "Vivere"!
living... without being jealous...
Signora, you have a store? - And what a store! - What kind? - A grocery.
everything can change world, but not for someone with a grocery store. Filippo De Libero, I have a store in Fondi.
people will always need groceries. - Unless the Russians come. - What do you mean?
the Russians don't believe in business. Life without business is nothing.
you accountants know anything! - What does the Pope think, Signora?
he made a speech yesterday. Everybody cried.
bombs killing women and children! - Don't our bombs kill?
you're the ones who wanted the war! - Me? - Yes, you, too.
if I... - You're wearing your Fascist pin.
so what? - I have one, too. Does that mean I wanted the war? Play something!
that won't change anything! The harm is done. - You talk as if you weren't Italian.
I'm not, if it means stay here and stuffing my face while the rest of the country is dying.
we're pigs. That's what we are! All pigs!
why do you always have to spoil everything, Michele?
he's not a bad boy, Signora. - No, Signora, he's really very nice.
my son should thank God that I'm around to earn money!
he's an idealist. - That's it! - So everybody makes a fool of you.
let's play " Faccetta Nera " [A Fascist song].
maybe I could buy some food for you.
once there was enough of everything here. Money was all you needed.
not now.
you can buy me fifty sacks of flour... twenty sacks of corn meal...
you want some split peas, beans, lentils?
how are the prices? - People around here are still honest.
a jar of lard and some olive oil.
who's got olive oil these days? - I'll get her some, Mama.
don't worry about them, Signora. They come almost every night.
why didn't they wash before dinner? - Ladies don't work on the land.
when I was young, we were worse off than you are!
your land was poor. You sowed the field with wheat and the priests took all the harvest. - You hear, Rosetta?
Papa.
in a little sack there are 60 nuts. Ten persons want an equal share.
do I multiply or divide?
why ask your father? You went to school, you have to teach us.
do you see this piece of bread?
if I want to give one piece to you and one piece to me, what do I do?
stupid! - Leave him alone! The school is closed, it is not his fault.
your uncle will teach you when he comes back. - He can wait. Go to your mother.
he'll never come back. - Where is he? - In Russia.
those Russian women, they only like foreign men. - There are no men in Russia?
peppino will come back!
he wants to be near his little girl. - He left her before she was born.
you want some of these carrots? - We fed these to horses. - War changes things.
Antonio, they're dropping the big lights!
the big lights! Look! There they are! You see the big lights?
how lovely, Mama, makes me feel like praying. - Then pray, my angel, pray.
I beg your pardon, I didn't want to offend you.
it would take more than that. What are they doing with those lights?
they are checking troop movements. - Can they see us? - Very clearly.
isn't there some safe place in the world?
you can't escape. And it is better so.
you see everything so black! What's on your conscience?
sins, like everybody? - There are no sins on my conscience.
well, you might count one... the day before yesterday.
you see? - It was not a sin for which I should die.
and where do the children come into it?
you're getting a real behind like a woman! Signora!
Michele!
Signora, I wanted to... I didn't know, I'm sorry. - Don't worry, she's only a little girl.
I'm inviting you both for a walk. - Dry yourself, dear.
ask the girl to excuse me. - Forget about it, will you? Come back later.
no, mamma!
don't make such a face. - I never want to see him again.
he couldn't have seen you. The sun was in his eyes.
the boy's a bit mad. His father spent a fortune to educate him and all he gets are insults.
the things he said were true. - What do you know about life?
if you talked to me the way he does, I would slap your face.
you should have seen him run!
we must be nice to him.
his father has hams, pasta, everything!
I'm first, I'm first, I won!
you're a real mountain goat! What's that book? - History, I failed it.
what school do you go to? - The convent.
in convents, you never learn how things really are. - Why?
michele says it's wrong to send me to the convent.
there's such a thing as public school, isn't there?
she goes to the best school in Rome. It costs a fortune.
that's right, in Italy, the more money you have the more you go with the priests and the nuns.
Rosetta! - Rosetta! - Ah, you and your smart ideas!
I'm sorry but sometimes I have to say what I think.
do you ever go to church? - Me? - Yes.
a few years ago, I wanted to become a priest.
you wanted to become a priest? - Yes, I did.
why didn't you go ahead and do it? - I realized I didn't have the vocation.
or rather that I did, which is why I didn't become a priest.
Rosetta! - I don't want to come!
come on! - You mustn't say things like that to her.
rosetta's a saint. I'm not even worthy to be her mother.
no, you're something better than you think. - What am I?
a shopkeeper. But in spite of that, you're a good person.
what's wrong with selling things? - You're the same as before. - What?
a peasant. - Thank you for the compliment.
it is one, nowadays. - What do you mean?
the uncivilized people are in the cities today. They are the evil ones.
but peasants could begin again after the war.
what does that mean?
they are the ones who could build something new, but that won't happen while the others control the government.
I'm sure you're wrong, you'll never change the peasants or cheat them.
I made a little money because I am like them,
I never trust anybody. A four-leaf clover!
it will bring you luck, here.
damn it!
damn it, I would give anything to be in Rome right now!
don't you even smoke?
no.
you have a girl? - No.
what's the matter? Didn't you ever have one? - No.
today if a man can't sacrifice a little, he's of no use to himself, his family or country.
right, you can do without a lot of things but not love.
Ehi, little one, come here! - Oh, what do they want?
what do you want? - Glad to see you again.
I was asking were the shortcut to Sella is. - Down there, straight ahead.
it's Filippo's son, the professor. You remember, he's of the good ones.
in that case, he'll be glad to hear what happened. Tell him.
I'd like to see his face when he hears it. Tell him.
we'd better go. - Tell him, tell him!
they have put the Duce in prison. - What are you talking about?
they put Mussolini in jail, like a thief, the one who made the Empire.
and what will happen to Italy now? Twenty years of glory ruined in a day, in an hour!
he was a fool, the Duce, for not getting rid of you traitors at the start.
you don't need reason with traitors. You use this!
put that away, will you? Let him alone, the Germans will get him. Let's go.
if it's really true, I will day happy. Go ahead!
No! - Be quiet, Rose, he will not fire.
the Germans will show you how they handle traitors!
they will make you lick dirt with your tongue! Go on, eat dirt!
let's go, Secretary. And you thank God we are kindhearted. Secretary...
they are going, my daughter, look, you see. Did you believe him Michele? It's like a comedy.
it's true, they're running away. - It's impossible! It can't be true.
but it's true. A new life is beginning.
we can go back to Rome. - Go wherever you like, we're free!
I'm going back, I'm going to tell everybody!
you know something? It's all crazy as hell.
excuse me, Rosetta.
we'll, I'm glad that they've liberated Mussolini, poor man. He has a wife and children, too.
just between us, Mussolini, as a man, I mean... what do you think of him?
as a man? - He would scare me.
how can you make love with that man? I'd freeze up.
all you have to do is switch off the light.
what are you laughing at? - Go and read your book.
I want to know. - We were talking politics.
Signora, tell us what's so funny. - Aren't we playing cards? One moment. Open up, there.
I win! - That's right.
come in.
these two are English. They need assistance.
their submarine brought them to Italy on a mission.
this is no business of yours. - We could hide them for a few days, before they go to South.
but the other people can protest.
they don't protest, they shoot! - Well?
you must explain to them we have a duty toward our families.
there are many spies. If the Germans found out, what a mess!
they'd take us all to Germany, Michele.
Yes, we must think about our children. - You don't have any.
you can't always think about yourself. - You're wearing your Fascist pin.
this way. - Michele.
we could give them some bread. - Isn't she stupid?
she wakes up hungry during the night, yet she wants to give away food. Come on.
they go right after, eh? - I knew you were a decent person.
damn it, anyway. - You should put something on it right away.
I'm used to it from slicing in the shop.
thank you. This wine should be good, because it was given by someone good.
to the English.
to the other English.
to Michele.
a drop for Rosetta, and to me.
to victory. - To a new world.
many of us hope that after the war there'll be a great change.
it will change, but first I'm afraid we'll have to beat the Germans.
it's very good.
viva Giovanni! - Giovanni!
who's Giovanni? - A little more, mamma.
you want to get drunk? My ears are hot already.
there are lots of good things in Italy. - You don't know Italy.
Oh, we know Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo. - They are dead.
you don't know the ones who are alive. Look at those eyes.
show the English your eyes, sweet angel. They're like two stars.
they're pretty. - Beautiful.
instead of landing your armies so far south you should have landed much further up, you would have bombed fewer cities.
and fewer children like this one would have been killed.
headquarters ordered it, it had to have a reason.
headquarters give orders, but they haven't seen these eyes.
why don't you ask him if the war will be finished by spring?
they know less than we do.
well, thank you very much. We don't want to abuse your hospitality.
where are they going to sleep? I've gone this far.
in the mountains, Signora. We're strong enough now.
there are caves up above here in the mountains.
thank you. - That's all right.
thank you, Signora. - Arrivederci.
Arrivederci. - Wait, I'll go see if it's all right.
come on!
put the things away. I'm going out for a breath of air. Feel my forehead.
how warm you are, mamma!
you just keep going straight ahead. - Good bye. Thank you.
when I have a drink, it goes right to my head.
who is Giovanni? - Are you still asking me that? Why do you want to know?
no reason. - He is a friend, one that I can trust.
do you love this Giovanni? - Do you love...?
Why? Can't I love if I want? A widow, she can't be loved?
he has a wife and two kids, anyway.
does it seem right to you that a person has to stick to someone he doesn't love?
it's terrible to go to bed with someone you don't like. Every night, all your life...
come on, Rose, come on.
this horseman is a donkey.
good night, Michele. - Good night. - At least, Michele! - The mice don't respect anything.
they have gnawed off even the Bible. - Put yourself in the middle.
we are not at church, you wanted to read us a story.
Michele, read whatever you want.
here you have beautiful stories, even better than in the novels.
I read of when Jesus walks on the sea. Better, the Lazarus' resurrection.
mama, come here, don't stand up.
no, I have to prepare the grass for dinner.
who's that? - He's the son of refugees just arrived. His mother is ill.
now we have become like goats, eating grass.
please, read. - Who has the flour, does not sell it. - Please, read.
the farmers buried it.
impossible to find the salt.
we ought to help each other. - We are all Italians. - Please read, Michele.
"a man named Lazarus - at Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister were living..." - Why have not you call me before?!
Mary is that person who anointed the Lord's feet with perfume and wiped them with her hair.
it was her brother Lazarus that was ill. - Amen.
so the sisters sent him this message: "Please, Master, you dear friend is ill."
Jesus said: "This illness will not result in death."
no, it is to promote the glory of God. Through it, the Son of God is to be glorified.
now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus...
can you give me some bread? - Be quiet.
he tarried, it is true, for two days in the place where he was.
Achille! Did you buy some oil? - No, they it was too expensive.
stupid, it will become even more expensive. You ought to buy!
a postcard for Serafino and one mail for Cesira.
did you listened at radio? - They failed to land because of a woman.
but now they'll carry out the offensive. - This time it's true.
Signora Cesira, here we are! - The Battista's son came back.
we're going to talk later. - See you...
Michele, let's go on.
he remained for two days in the place where he was. Then after this he said to his disciples:
"let us go back to Judea."
the disciples said to him: "Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and you want to go back there?"
Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in a day?"
if one walks during the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world. But if one walks at night...
they tried to steal at home, but Giovanni cheated them!
he's better than a brother!
they could to ruin me. The Rosetta's dowry was in the wardrobe.
you are all dead, deader than Lazarus.
with your flour, with your thieves' scare, your wealth walled up not even Jesus Christ could resuscitate you!
Michele!
what's wrong? - Nothing
mama, was listening to him!
Michele's right.
please stop! What's wrong?
nothing. - You called us dead!
we'll die by starvation for sure! - Me too I'm dead. - You, so young?
you have always to say what is in your heart, right or wrong...
I have not the nerve to talk aloud. - You're even too much sincere.
I am not sincere with you. - With me?
sure, with you.
Shoo! Even the goats! I'll have to clean up everything here.
the gate is broken since I went away.
let's go, it's raining.
I love you, Cesira.
in such a trouble, do you mind to that? - I have to tell you.
you could too give me a smack in the face, but it's true.
these stupids are here to see the scene!
don't you mind to such a things? - Me?
you mind, you mind. You have someone in your heart.
only my daughter.
I've decided to go back home, Rosetta. - Se vuoi, mamma.
they won't bomb Rome anymore. They'll start bombing here. - True, mamma.
how skinny you got. You need more to eat. We have plenty to eat, in Rome.
how cold she is! Come here, Rosetta.
mama, why doesn't he come anymore, Michele? - I don't know.
he loves you, Michele. - Go on.
I can see why, you're so beautiful.
he's 25 years old! Never go with a boy younger than yourself.
but he's the nicest man in Sant'Eufemia. - Being a nice man these days isn't much help.
damn draft!
you know what I think Michele is? A subversive. - What's that?
someone with a good heart who doesn't like work.
we'd better give him back his book. - But he gave it to me. - He'd make a good husband.
he has no vices. If you were a few years older, I'd let you marry him.
what are you saying, mamma! - You'll have to think about such things someday, no?
listen to her laugh!
did you fall in or something?
seriously! You're going to make us late for school!
I told you, go away.
take it easy.
it's 7: 25. Why aren't you guys dressed?
we would be...if Ariel would get out of the bathroom!
she's been in there for, like, 20 minutes.
okay, okay. Ariel, you all right in there?
just go away, Dad.
just go... go use me and Mom's bathroom.
but my toothbrush is in this bathroom.
all right, just your finger. Go on, go on.
whatever it is, we'll figure it out, okay?
No! You can't figure this out.
you want me to go get Mom?
No! Mom can't help me. No one can.
Ariel, come on, now!
all right, open the door. I'm serious.
you want me to go get the key?
Ariel?
help me, Daddy.
what's wrong with me, Daddy?
what's happening to me?
Oh, no.
Ariel, honey, what are you doing up?
it's 3: 58 in the morning. You promised me you weren't going to study past 12: 00.
uh, I... I wasn't planning to.
I just took a practice quiz and realized I had a lot more studying to do.
what are you doing up?
weird dream.
thought I'd get a glass of milk. Do you want one?
mom, I'm trying to stay awake.
honey, come on.
you know I don't like you pulling these all-nighters.
you're not going to learn anything new at 3: 58 in the morning.
I know.
I know. I just...
I need, like, ten more minutes.
and that glass of milk sounds really nice, actually.
while I'm young, Mom.
right.
while you're still young.
Hey, you can't have soda for breakfast. Master Chocolatiers since 1845.
Hey, I'm pretty sure I can.
soda, Ariel, really?
I think it's a little early in the morning for caffeine and sugar, don't you?
but I need sugar and caffeine because I need something to keep me awake for my AP Chem. exam.
more like you need something to keep you awake for your new boyfriend.
did I just hear the "B" word?
Yeah, he's got a name.
never heard of him.
should I have heard of him? - Nope.
nothing to hear about. He's just a friend, and he took AP Chem. last year.
so, he lent me his old notes.
what kind of person keeps their old notes from a high school class?
what are you talking about? A got a whole box full of notes from college.
in the garage.
there's nothing wrong with that. What?
that sounds smart to me.
well, Liam is smart.
uh, and if he keeps a 4. 0 this year, he gets a full scholarship to Stanford.
Hey, can I have some of that coffee? Cause that doesn't have sugar.
you know what? I don't like the way your eyes look.
I know I told you that you could take the car today, but...
I don't think I want you behind the wheel.
not on a couple hours sleep.
no, but I-I need the car.
I'm babysitting Brendan for the Kerrigans tonight.
I need to get there before you get home.
don't worry about it. Come on, we'll work it out.
but I'm going to give you a ride to school.
but...
all right, everyone, pencils down and pass your answer sheets forward.
brutal.
Yeah.
that was a-- that was a tough one.
you look a little tired, Ariel.
are you sure you're going to be able to babysit Brendan tonight?
uh, absolutely. 6:30, right?
thanks again for coming on such short notice.
it's always hard for me to get out of the house when my husband's out of town.
I'm grateful, really.
was there something else?
no.
sorry, I'll...
I'll see you at 6: 30.
she's lost it.
I'm sorry, I mean, I know you like her, and I know you babysit for her, but that test was cruel and unusual.
I'm worried about her.
worried about her? Worry about me.
I'm the one on the verge of flunking.
seems like she's changed a lot since last year.
I mean, I don't know. She just seemed happy.
I guess.
she was the yearbook advisor, and she chaperoned all the field trips, and now she just teaches.
and she doesn't seem to like that very much either.
well... she did just have a baby.
after my mom had my little sister, she couldn't go ten minutes without crying for, like, three months.
speaking of beautiful babies...
hottie at 11: 00.
here he comes. And here I go.
no, no, no, where?
where are you going?
Ariel, come on, you're into this guy.
and I've got about four days of freedom before my parents find out how I did on that exam.
I'm not going to waste them being a third wheel.
I don't-- I don't like him like that.
right. You know, denial is such an ugly shade on you.
Hey, Liam. Hey.
how'd your big test go?
well, if I did even halfway decently, it's totally thanks to you.
and if I didn't, it's cause I stayed up all night studying.
hmm. Yeah, well, you got to pace yourself.
is that how you get a full ride to Stanford?
well, I kind of wish you would've told me that a little sooner.
I have a Spanish presentation sixth period, and I'm starting to worry I might doze off right in the middle of.
well, I don't recommend a steady diet of all-nighters, although I've pulled one or two in my day.
but, uh, if you're really wiped,
I think I got just the thing for you.
hold out your hand.
come on.
okay.
there.
your keys.
Yeah, th-the big one in the middle is for my car.
wait, I don't get it. You want me to drive your car around - so that I stay awake during Spanish? - No.
it's a station wagon. If you fold the seats down, it's actually a pretty good place to take a nap.
it's been my secret exam weapon ever since my mom gave me the keys.
you sleep in your car during school?
Oh, yeah, sure, as long as I have a free period that day.
how else do you think I keep up my GPA?
but I don't know. What if somebody finds me out there?
that's never happened to me.
you want me to wake you up after fifth period?
thanks for the offer, but I don't...
ready to give that presentation?
what?
sixth period bell just rang. Nap time is over.
I don't understand. How did-- how did I get here?
you really were wiped, huh?
no, no, you don't understand. I really don't remember how I got here.
the last thing I remember was...
you and me were on the quad, and you-you offered me your keys.
and now I'm here.
I mean, in between, nothing.
you know what I mean?
it happened again.
Hey, Brendan.
Hi.
no, it's okay.
Oh, oh, oh, I know. I know. Shh, shh.
you want your mommy? Yeah?
Yeah, you want your mommy? I think I want my mommy, too.
okay, okay, okay.
let's see if we can get them on the phone first, okay?
okay. Come on.
miss Dubois.
you ready to give your statement now?
statement about what?
what...
uh, wha-what's happening to me?
Where-where did all the cars come from?
how did I get here?
you called 911.
I was the first officer on the scene, remember?
no, actually, I don't.
what time is it right now?
it's about 8: 30. Why?
it happened again.
Oh, I'm sorry, what happened again? - Ariel!
it's okay, I'm here. Your father's on his way.
everything's gonna be okay.
it's not okay.
okay, something is wrong with me. Something is happening to me.
honey, what are you talking about?
I keep losing time.
in one second, I am one place, the next, I am someplace else.
they are asking me to give a statement about what happened to Mrs. Kerrigan, and I don't remember anything.
I don't remember calling 911.
sweetie, look at me.
it's okay. Whatever it is, we are gonna figure it out.
it's okay. It's okay, I promise.
you okay?
Sarah Bishop.
ms. Bishop.
from down the street.
we just moved in a few doors down from you.
we met last weekend, remember?
I'm sorry, I don't feel well.
I need to call my mom and dad. I need to get home.
your mom and dad?
okay.
I just finished up my last class. If you're sick, I can take you home.
feeling any better?
uh, no. Sorry, I just really want to get home.
well... good news.
we're here.
I thought you said you knew where I lived.
I do.
isn't this your house?
you're home early.
hey there, neighbor. You and Bob finally get all your stuff unpacked?
ready to give that presentation?
Liam, what are you doing here?
I left you a message. Didn't you get it?
my meeting got pushed, so... I came home a little early.
uh... what... what are you talking about-- "home"?
this isn't your home.
I've seen your home.
what's going on?
there's nothing going on, and this is my home.
it's your home, too. We live here-- you, me, and Anna.
who's Anna?
uh, three-foot-eight, likes birthday cake and drawing on the wall in permanent marker, came out of your womb, like, five years ago?
any of that ring a bell?
mommy!
you're home!
six years ago, right after you got your master's.
Bridgette was your maid of honor.
my dad was the best man.
you really don't remember, do you?
no.
when I woke up this morning, I was a teenager, okay, and now apparently, the last ten years of my life have disappeared.
I'm... married.
I have a child.
honey...
please don't call me that.
I'm not your honey, I'm not your wife.
okay, I-I can't be.
I'm in high school.
you teach high school, Ariel, the same as our neighbor Sarah.
okay, I know, I know, you told me that, and I, and I know that you're just trying to help me, but I don't belong here.
okay, I... I need to go home, I need to go to my real home.
okay, I need to talk to my parents.
okay.
okay? - Sure. Why not?
maybe they can figure out what this is all about.
they always have a much better handle on this kind of stuff than I do.
wait, you know?
you know about me, you know about my mom?
Ariel, we're married.
okay, so then, then you think maybe these gaps in my memory, all this time that I've lost, you think it might have something to do with that?
I don't know, but let's go ask the experts. Shall we?
honey, what is it? You look like you've been crying.
mom. Mom.
Oh, slow down.
I don't recognize her.
I don't know who she is.
I mean, Liam keeps telling me that she's mine, but... for that matter, I barely know Liam.
and he's supposed to be my husband?
mom, the last ten years of my life are gone, okay, and I don't know, I was just hoping that maybe you could help me get them back.
so the last thing you remember is the night that Mrs. Kerrigan died?
um, I was with Mom outside her house.
there were police everywhere, and they said that I was, was inside when Mrs. Kerrigan was shot, but I don't remember that.
okay, I don't remember anything except for finding the body.
I mean, I still don't know what happened to her.
well, no one does, not really.
all the police could figure out for certain was that it was an execution.
the killer didn't steal anything, didn't assault her in any way.
just went in and shot her and left.
the police questioned her husband, her ex-boyfriends, even a student that she failed, but no one could ever figure out who did it.
do you think maybe that-that's why I'm here?
maybe I'm supposed to help them find the person who did it.
what are you talking about?
you're here because this is your life.
you're here because you've always been here.
you keep saying that.
you believe that, but I am telling you, to me, I just woke up in this place.
I don't know, may... maybe I'm ill, okay?
maybe there is something wrong with my brain.
maybe there has been something wrong with my brain for the last ten years of my life.
listen, the night that Mrs. Kerrigan died, you told your mom that you were having some problems with your memory, and we took you to see a specialist, a neurologist, and he did every test.
he ran every test he could and he didn't find anything wrong.
and you've been fine ever since--no blackouts till today.
I - I suppose we could run some more tests.
I'm sorry, okay?
it's just, I am so scared.
so much time has gone by.
I have lost so many memories already, and I just-- I don't... I don't want to lose anymore.
first thing tomorrow, we'll take you to another doctor, but in the meantime, just remember, you are surrounded by people who love you
me, Daddy, Liam, Anna.
come on, you-- there you go, oh.
I don't want to go home with them.
I want to stay here tonight. This is, this is my home.
you are my family.
Ariel, whether you remember her or not, you have a child now.
we have a grandchild.
imagine how frightening this must be for her.
don't you think your place should be with her right now?
daddy told me you're having trouble remembering stuff today.
you still remember me, right?
of course, sweetie.
how could anyone forget you?
good night, darling.
you mean "Good night, Panda Bear," don't you?
panda Bear-- isn't that what I said?
panda Bear?
good night, Panda Bear.
I'll see you in the morning.
all right.
she's so beautiful.
Yeah, well, she kind of takes after her mother that way.
what?
do you want me to cover up?
maybe I'll just
I'll cover up.
sorry, I just-- I have a lot of getting used to.
what?
so... let me ask you something.
um, wow, how do I put this?
are, are you here... right now?
I mean, am I having this moment, making this memory all by myself?
no, I'm here right now, I promise.
good... good, because I'm here, too, for you, whatever you need.
so, another crazy question:
um, you and me
as far as you're concerned, we never, um...
no.
no, I may be the only woman who has a child but can't remember losing her virginity.
my cousin the priest would probably say you're the second.
so what do you do for a living?
I manage a hedge fund...
and I'm pretty good at it.
do you remember how we...?
um, it was right after Mrs. Kerrigan died, and you were pretty shaken up and I took you to this restaurant and you started crying right in the middle of dinner, and then I felt so bad for you.
but then we just ended up going to my car and...
and just talking for a really long time...
and I'm pretty sure that was the night I decided I was never going to let you out of my life.
and you don't even remember.
no.
but, uh, what I... what I do remember is, when we were in high school, and you let me take a nap in your car, and you had that orange key chain, and...
...you put it on my wrist like it was a bracelet.
and our hands touched, and I...guess it just hit me that you were the one I wanted to be with.
okay, so, uh, sleeping arrangements.
we should probably make a plan.
if you want, I will stay here with you, but I'm also happy to go crash in the guest room.
guest room it is.
I love you, Ariel.
it's okay.
you don't have to say it.
you just have to know it.
I'll see you in the morning.
Oh, my God!
it's you.
did you honestly think I wouldn't recognize you behind that mask?
no, you can't.
you wouldn't.
not to the mother of your own son.
you don't remember any of this?
Mrs. Kerrigan's husband told the police he was in the Army Reserves.
he was training at a base a hundred miles away that night.
he's lying.
I don't know. His alibi's good. That sounds pretty solid.
I'm telling you, Liam.
he shot Mrs. Kerrigan, and he was wearing a mask, but she knew it was him.
he said it right before he shot her.
so, he-he was wearing a mask, but she still knew it was her husband?
you... saw that?
she called him the father of her child.
and don't you see? Maybe this is why all this is happening to me.
maybe if I prove that Mr. Kerrigan killed his wife, then all of this...
memory thing, this time-skipping thing
it'll just stop.
I mean, that's how it worked for my mom.
okay.
but how do you prove that this guy's lying?
I mean, that was a long time ago.
does my mom still work for the district attorney?
for the district attorney?
no. Not exactly.
Mr. Kerrigan.
thanks for coming in. It's, it's been a while.
Mr. Chief of Police.
Yes. I was surprised to hear from you.
you already know our district attorney, Allison Dubois.
and, of course, Manny Devalos was the D. A.during the investigation.
Mr. Mayor, nice to see you again. - Please.
so, uh, don't keep me in suspense here.
what's going on?
as you know, my daughter Ariel was actually there that night.
it's been our mutual frustration that's she's never been able to remember anything at all about it.
Yes, of course, I remember.
how is Ariel, by the way?
she was always my son's favorite babysitter.
Oh, she's fine, thank you.
as a matter of fact, she's finally starting to recover memories from that night.
are you serious?
well, that's... that's amazing.
does she... Does she know who killed Lisa?
actually, she does.
in light of that, we thought it might be productive to talk to you, see if there was any chance you would like to revisit your account of where you were on the night in question.
what do you mean? Why would I want to do that?
with all due respect, Mr. Kerrigan, your, uh, alibi was never exactly airtight.
I was in the Army Reserves.
I was stationed 130 miles away that night.
is Ariel seriously saying that I killed Lisa?
we're all aware that you supposed to be sleeping at the base that night, but the sergeant in charge noted here that you weren't at that afternoon's marksmanship drill.
you also missed final bed check that night.
I was doing extra... - ...phys... Extra physical training.
by yourself in the middle of the night. We remember your deposition.
but that leaves an awfully big hole in your day.
a man could get a lot of driving done in that time.
what the hell is going on here?
what, are you two up for reelection or something?
are you trying to grab some headlines?
what's going on is, we're offering you a chance to cooperate with us.
you tell us the truth, you can expect a little leniency.
but either way, my office is going to pursue this theory of investigation to its conclusion.
I can't believe you people are making me do this.
you're right.
I didn't tell the truth about where I was that night.
I was seeing someone near the base, a woman.
we met when I first joined the Army Reserves, and every time I went up there, I...
I made sure I got the chance to see her.
even if it meant slipping a 20 to the guard on post so that I could slip off base for a while.
I never told you because I didn't think I had to.
I didn't think I had to because I didn't kill my wife, and because I had hoped to spare her family the knowledge that I was sleeping with another woman on the night she was murdered.
this woman you were seeing-- can she confirm that?
Yes.
her name's Rebecca Moore.
I haven't seen her since I left the Reserves, and we didn't exactly leave it on good terms, but I don't think she wants to see me go away for murder.
you don't remember me?
Brendan Kerrigan. You used to babysit for me.
Oh, uh, of course I - I remember.
I just, um...
I don't understand why you're doing this to me.
either you are a very confused or a very malicious, young lady.
why are you mad at Ariel, Dad?
because she made a mistake.
a terrible, hurtful mistake.
come on, son.
surprise! Happy birthday!
Oh, your twenty-fifth.
it was a fun night.
well, I'll have to take your word for it.
I was just kind of hoping that some old movies would jog my memory, but...
nothing?
it's weird.
these people are my friends. You know, they...
...know me, I know them, but I couldn't tell you one of their names.
you know what you need?
wine.
I know you're only 16, sort of, but the 26-year-old you has a glass of merlot when she can't sleep.
trust me.
works every time.
got a bottle I've been holding on to for a special occasion.
does amnesia count as a special occasion?
thank you.
Oh, my gosh, we're at dinner, and she's, like, "Oh, I'm so tired.
I'm, like, "What, tired? You can't be tired!
you're the one who said you had to work. - Ariel?
Hey. Your mom's on the phone.
Oh, I'll take it in here.
Hello?
sweetie, I know it's late.
I need you to come over here right now.
can you do that, please?
Hey, Mom, what's going on? You okay?
I'm fine, but I need you here.
I need to speak to you in person.
but-but why? - I just had a dream, Ariel.
I know what's going on.
everything that's happened to you, everything you've gone through-- I think I understand it now.
it's about Brendan Kerrigan.
I was always about Brendan Kerrigan.
wait. I don't understand what you're saying to me. What's about Brendan?
I know who killed his mother, Ariel.
I know who killed Mrs. Kerrigan.
but I need to explain it to you in person. I need to...
mom?
can we go now?
Anna, is that you?
mom, who else would I be?
what is it? You look like you're gonna be sick or something.
I was just at home, and I was about to go see Grandma.
we did go see Grandma.
she's right there.
where is she?
inside.
what's wrong with her, Daddy?
seven years.
my mother's been dead for seven years.
she was murdered.
my dad was out of town on business.
burglar came in the house and shot her in the back of the head.
never caught him.
I know.
I didn't.
apparently, it happened the night she called to tell me about her dream.
she said she knew what all this was about.
everything that was happening to me.
she was just about to tell me, and...
...then I was in the cemetery.
with Anna seven years later just like that.
I don't know if I could go through this again, Ariel.
the last time this happened, you never got your memories back.
and you and me-- we...
we had to start over.
I know you don't remember, but...it was...tough.
you sound angry with me...
I'm not angry, Ariel.
I'm not.
I'm just tired.
okay, so who killed Mrs. Kerrigan?
when my mother called, she said she knew who killed her, and then, I just blanked out.
we never finished our conversation, but that doesn't mean it wasn't finished.
your mother wanted to speak to you in person, so you left.
by the time you got to her house, she was dead.
you were the one who found her body.
okay, uh, the last thing that she said to me was that everything was because of Brendan Kerrigan.
that-that it's all about him.
so maybe he knows something.
maybe he, uh...
maybe he learned something about what happened to his mom.
I have to talk to him, or I may-may never find out.
my God, Ariel, do you really want to upset those poor people all over again?
those poor people.
what about us?
what about me?
please... just let it go.
let it go and stay with me.
stay with Anna.
I'm begging you, for the sake of our family.
I...
I can't.
Ariel. What do you want?
I know I'm the last person you want to see, but I wouldn't have come unless it was really important.
I need to speak to your son.
and what could you and Brendan possibly have to discuss?
I'm not sure, not exactly, but I think it has to do with what happened to Mrs. Kerrigan.
the last thing that my mom said to me before she died was that Brendan was the key to everything, that he had always been the key to everything.
Really?
Ariel, your mom was killed seven years ago.
why are you coming here now?
I need to talk to your son, please.
I think you should go.
dad?
is everything okay?
it's you.
you wouldn't.
not to the mother of your own son.
my God.
are you okay, Ariel? What are you doing here?
she was just leaving, Brendan.
you talked to Brendan?
I didn't have to.
I just had to look at him.
Brendan's your son.
you were sleeping with Mrs. Kerrigan. You killed her.
I had to.
she was pregnant. I was 18.
she wanted to tell everybody what we were doing.
she kept saying that she loved me, that she wanted to be with me, that she wanted Brendan to be with me.
I was going into college.
I was planning a life.
I couldn't let her take that away from me.
or my mother.
I always knew there was a chance one of you would get to the truth.
that's what I bought into when I married into your family.
when she called that night,
I listened in on the extension.
I knew she was about to tell you everything, so I drove over to her house.
I beat you there by a couple of minutes.
we're a family, Ariel.
I had to fight to protect what we have.
we don't have anything.
I barely know you.
you lost that time, not me.
you might not know who I am. I know you.
you're the love of my life, Ariel.
stop it!
you killed...my mother.
you told Brendan everything, right?
you didn't?
no.
why would I?
because I followed you here tonight, Ariel.
I knew that if I wanted to keep what we have,
I couldn't let you see Brendan, and the only way to keep you from seeing him was to take away everything that we have.
Oh, God, please. Please don't.
couldn't bring myself to do it before you walked in there.
I love you way too much.
but now I had time to think.
now I know I have to for Anna.
I have to protect Anna.
No! Please!
ready to give that presentation?
Dubois. What gives?
Hey, what...?
don't ever touch me.
I just got the call.
it's done.
and he went to the house?
with the gun?
it was his father's.
he told the police that he was afraid he was going to lose his scholarship.
that he didn't know what else to do.
and Mrs. Kerrigan?
she's fine.
I mean, just shaken, but she's fine.
you know, she's gonna lose her job over this.
I know.
honey, you did the right thing.
you saved a life.
mom?
Yeah.
will you call me Panda Bear?
Oh, I love you, Panda Bear.
I love you, Mom.
the last time mark had a problem, he was away from me testifying in one of his cases.
why can't you remember everything?
because I was loaded, okay?
before he turned around, the flash-forward ended.
so I don't think he saw me.
his son's your patient.
my son's condition makes him a little hard to read.
Dylan's autistic.
you're panicked over what might happen.
but we've gotta use these flash-forwards to our advantage.
Hey, mark.
we got our funding. Mosaic's still alive.
I know what caused the flash-forwards.
you don't believe me.
well, of course I do.
the world's greatest mystery's been solved by a boozer on a train bound for Los Angeles.
can you connect to the internet with that?
real quick, do an image search for "quantum physicist genius.
go on. I'll wait.
which popped up first--me winning the Robert Wilson award or the jaunty one of me holding lab goggles over my genitals
hold up.
you really... - I'm obviously wasting my time.
I'm sorry.
I've just heard that line a hundred times before.
you genuinely want to know?
of course.
the flash-forwards were caused by you.
it's simple quantum mechanics, really.
whenever a heavenly body carries such an intense force of attraction, the universe just goes... bananas.
sounds technical.
helps if you have a Ph.D or two.
if my calculations are correct, your dark energy could bring about another catastrophe at any moment.
luckily, I've pinpointed the one location on earth that has an irresistible enough force to counteract you.
let me guess
your sleeper car. - Grab your purse.
we've not a moment to lose.
I thought for sure that would work.
maybe for a 21-year-old sorority girl.
but, um, I've learned never to go anywhere unless I'm gonna get the real thing.
the actual cause?
I have a theory, but the, uh...
the science is a little complicated.
I'm a complicated girl.
the most basic concept you need to understand is quantum superpositions.
are you aware of the double slit experiment?
well, there was that one time in college... - What about Schrodinger's cat?
no, I'm not that kinky.
close your eyes.
give me your hand.
okay.
now imagine you have a cat...
B. L.'S a liter in the field and only one P. I.V.
we need access here!
a teeny, tiny cat...
what have we got? - We've got a gunshot wound to the abdomen.
we need to set up a peripheral.
Janis? - We need access here!
that fits in the palm of your hand.
you also have a poisonous sardine.
once we close your palm, there are two possible scenarios.
bring the code cart.
come on, let's go.
clear.
either the cat eats the sardine and dies, or the cat doesn't eat the sardine and lives.
no response.
going again.
quantum physics says until we open your hand to discover the cat's fate, both eventualities occur at the same time.
clear.
still no response.
do C. P.R.
for us, the cat is both living and deceased.
but how can that be?
that's the miracle of quantum mechanics
the observer gets to decide.
the kitty's already made up its mind.
alive or dead?
see for yourself.
Hemoglobin's holding at 12.
Hallelujah.
okay.
Fascia's closed.
o" silk on a driver to dr. Varley.
I'm gonna be honest.
a few hours ago, I didn't think we'd get this far.
close the silk.
let me know when she wakes up.
this is mark. leave it here. I'll get back to you.
Hi. It's me.
where are you?
I have been calling and calling.
I tried Demetri and Stan.
I just can't get through.
I tried the office, and they're just stonewalling me.
after this thing with Janis, I don't know, I'm worried.
can you just call me?
please?
I love you.
I love you.
again, daddy, again.
you're not bored with this one?
No!
cards.
make the cards.
okay.
I'll turn around, and you choose.
so, Dylan, you know it's almost time for you to leave the hospital.
we're gonna go to Palo Alto.
which one?
which one?
did you pick a card?
okay, now look at it and remember.
okay?
okay.
so now it's just you and me.
I was thinking that the best idea is you come and live in my house with me.
no.
cards.
we all lived there before your mother and I...
I mean, you'll have your own room.
it' be great.
cards!
please.
I need you to go along with this.
okay.
uh... is this your card?
it's my house, too.
Hey, buddy.
almost time for trick-or-treating.
that's today?
Yeah, it's the 31st.
it's Halloween. The kids go from room
no, no, no, I know. I just forgot to get him a costume.
um, I'll be right back, okay?
excuse me.
playing cards, bud?
it's my house, too.
how's Janis?
two uniformed cops outside her room.
only her doctor an FBI badges are allowed inside.
good work.
no one will be able to get to her.
but what about you guys?
whoever it was that came after you last night, what's to stop them from trying again?
nothing.
Hey!
are you okay? What happened?
Yeah, yeah. It's nothing. It's nothing.
but you have blood on your shirt.
well, now listen.
there's a room full of FBI agents that need a doctor to tell them if Janis is gonna make it.
okay. - All right.
okay.
we had her in surgery for five hours.
the bullet did some damage, but there shouldn't be any lasting effects.
And?
and she's in recovery.
she's sedated.
we'll know more when she wakes up.
Olivia, you saved her life.
thank you.
all right, everybody, it's been a long night for all of us.
it'll be a while before we know anything more.
the hospital doesn't need us clogging things up.
so I got your numbers. Get some rest.
I'll call you if I hear anything.
you, too, Demetri.
I'm sorry, boss, no.
I'm either staying here to see her through, or I'm going out and finding the people who did this to us.
there are already two dozen agents working this who didn't have a grenade launched at them last night.
now I'm serious.
get outta here.
and if it helps, consider it an order.
you tired?
well, Wedeck told us to go home.
no.
he said for us to get out of the hospital.
it's a surface wound. Just leave it.
are you kidding me? I want to see what those D. C. Doctors did.
Oh, Livy, it's nothing.
come on.
you want to tell me what happened?
you don't... - I want to know.
we were attacked.
um, pretty bad firefight.
Wedeck and Demetri killed one of them.
the others escaped.
it's gotta be connected to the guys who came after Janis.
simultaneous attacks.
because you're investigating the blackout?
why would anyone want to kill you because of that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
still trying to figure it all out.
Oh, see?
I knew I shouldn't have told you.
no.
no, it's not that.
it's... when they brought Janis in,
I couldn't get ahold of you.
my imagination just ran wild
I mean, not knowing where you were, not knowing what was going on.
it was horrible.
but I'm here, and I'm okay, all right?
I'm all right.
we have just been so... obsessed with what we saw, and with the future, with what might or might not happen.
and it's-- It's a distraction.
it's just pulling us out of today, and today, right now this moment is all we have, babe.
it's all we have.
I don't want to miss it.
me neither.
Hey, Dewey.
how is she?
a lot better than these guys.
do you mind?
got no I. D...
no cell phone, no keys.
no fingerprints, no dental records.
it's just like our guy in the parking garage in D. C.
we got nothing.
got nothing.
there's no question now we're up against real pros.
what about, um, medical history, Dewey?
so far just one removed appendix here, one Achilles surgery there.
I'm checking for radial keratotomy scars as we speak.
Hey, Demetri.
yeah? What?
you doing okay in here?
Yeah.
Why?
you put yourself on mosaic.
you think there's anybody in the office who doesn't know by now?
but the point is, you just got shot at 12 hours ago.
now you're standing in a morgue acting kind of weird.
listen, Al, you've been acting kind of weird for a couple of weeks yourself, all right?
um, you want to talk about our feelings, or you want to get back to work?
work sounds good.
this guy's right eye is covered with corneal scarring.
no big surprise there.
what assassin worth his salt doesn't get like?
should practically be a union requirement.
wait.
you see that?
it's like a hand stamp from a bar.
no, it's a blue hand.
it's a clue from mark's board.
something about Baltimore-- a hand--a blue hand.
this son of a bitch is gonna be useful after all.
that costume is super fly.
it was the last thing they had left in his size.
no, I like it. Really, it's cool.
although he doesn't seem to like this very much.
Yeah, it's hard to tell with him.
I think 's mad at me about the move.
Oh, I was just wondering if in the next couple of days dr. Benford might come by so we could, say our good-byes.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, I'll let her know.
great, thanks.
Hey.
I'm glad she's okay.
Yeah.
it's pretty scary stuff for all of us.
Yeah.
listen, it's been a rough week, and maybe I said some things that were out of line.
let's take a deep breath and get back on track here, hmm?
this only takes quarters.
I got it.
there. - Thank you.
we're even now.
the guys who came after you, the guys who shot Janis-- all Asian.
why don't I head over to Huang's office, see if blue hand has some special significance in Cantonese or mandarin?
Mandarin?
come on, man.
according to the CIA, China might have caused the blackout.
if they did, trying to blow up a team of federal agents seems a little showy, don't you thk?
well, in their minds, I mean, it could be as simple as neutralizing a threat.
well, then why come after us?
the CIA agent who testified at the hearings yesterday is fine, but mark talks about D. Gibbons, suspect zero, the crows for the first time outside of this office, and then eight hours later, it's... China is a dead end.
I don't want blue hand to become one, too.
all right, do you know where you are?
I am in a hospital?
very good.
do you know who I am?
no.
but for some weird reason,
I get the feeling that your husband is a little bit of a neat freak.
I don't know.
something about how he doesn't let his black pens to touch his blue pens.
does that sound familiar?
she's back.
you're an amazing doctor. - And an overworked one.
I wish I could be with you guys tonight.
Oh, we'll take pictures.
can you make sure she doesn't eat too much candy?
sure. - Just, like, a couple of pieces or something.
couple?
20.0
I'll see what I can do.
Bye.
when mark had you pin the blue hand card to the board, he knew it was somehow related to the word "Baltimore."
Yes, that's what I'm saying, sparky.
okay, Baltimore street is 5 miles away.
let's go check it out.
but you were attacked last night in D. C.
so Baltimore, Maryland, is the better bet.
Yeah, but the guy who had the blue hand stamp on him was in L. A. All right?
Baltimore street is in silver lake.
if I'm wrong -- We've wasted an hour.
what?
so you believe in these visions now?
it's--it's complicated.
no, I get it.
I mean, if I hadn't had a flash-forward,
I'd be doing everything I could to prove those visions weren't true.
listen, if we had anything to go on at all here, any real-life lead whatsoever, believe me, I'd be the first guy talking to ballistics or forensics or whatever, all right?
but we don't.
I just want to find the animal that are trying to kill us, and Baltimore street is the only thing I can think of, all right?
so come on.
I'll buy you a pressed sandwich from the Cuban place.
sold.
one out.
super shark has monkey-see and monkey-do in his helmet!
he's trying to eat them!
daddy, that pulls.
just be still. I've almost got it.
I can't believe you don't have a costume.
you always have a costume.
I've been a little busy lately.
I can finish up with her if you want to get in your costume.
Thanks, Nicole, but I'm not wearing a costume.
you could go as Tim-Tim's dad, Jim tim.
what does Tim-Tim's dad look like?
don't say a word, Obi-Wan.
you've got to be kidding me.
was that a kangaroo?
that is the best costume I have ever seen.
Hey, got some milk from the nurses' station to...
I'm--I'm sorry.
I seem to have lost my son.
what's he look like?
uh, he's about this big, uh, wearing, um... well--well, a pimp's outfit.
I mean, I only turned my head for a second.
haven't seen him, but there are tons of kids around.
you might want to check the nurses' station.
okay, thank you.
sir, you don't have to stay here with me.
I'm sure after everything that happened last night, the office is chaotic.
I'm right where I need to be.
I just feel really uncomfortable in this gown and...
I associate those crappy gowns with my wife delivering our son.
after you've seen a thing like that...
was it awful?
just the opposite.
it's... primal.
you feel like you're there at the beginning of something...miraculous... a new life.
you'll see.
what's that?
that little monitor up there.
Janis, I'm sorry. We have to take you back to the O. R.
bring the type specific.
what's wrong? - Your blood count's dropping.
get her on a portable. - What--what's going on?
don't know.
times Square.
april 29th.
the estimates on the mosaic web site have us at half a million people already.
the ball is gonna drop and everything.
half a million people going to their future.
it's a glorified new year's party.
do you have something better to do?
Yeah, you could say that.
who is she?
Oh, come on.
I told you mine.
he... had a neck like an ox...
smelled like a meat locker...
what the hell were you guys doing?
I had my hands around his neck.
I don't know where I was or who the man was...
but I felt my thumbs press down on his trachea...until something snapped.
and then I let go...
looked down at his lifeless body, quite satisfied.
aren't you glad you asked?
I found this on the south exit camera.
Yeah, that's him.
how long ago was this?
17 minutes.
where could he be heed this time of night?
I have no idea.
you getting on? Then get on.
come on. We gotta go.
Hey, kid, you gotta pay the re!
Hey, kid.
you gotta pay the fare.
now do you have it or not?
are you lost?
to our friends at 25696 sawyer court, Los Angeles, California, 90024.
what is he, brain damaged or something?
is he one of those... - I'm gonna put you down like a sick dog if you don't shut up.
it's my house, too.
that's your house?
you know that address?
Yeah, and he's gonna need a transfer.
that's $1. 55.
don't worry, kid.
do you know any magic tricks?
no, Mijo.
I don't do magic.
you said an hour.
it's been over three.
she's back in surgery.
she'll pull through.
Why?
she had a flash-forward, so she has a future?
450 out, and she's tachy in the 130s.
what are we waiting for?
we only have one real option here.
5-0 vicryl.
with all due respect, dr. Benford...- We're gonna do a b-lynch.
did I ever tell you about the night before she and I graduated from Quantico?
no.
we're at some dorm room getting hammered.
I get us a beer. We finish.
she gets us a couple more, then a couple of shots, and, uh,
I'm starting to worry that nerdy little girl's gonna have to have her stomach pumped, right?
there's no guarantee that a b-lynch will contain the bleeding.
a b-lynch is a far less invasive procedure.
gives her a fighting chance of still having a normal, healthy uterus.
Ba next thing I know, it's 4: 00 A. M.
I wake up on linoleum, got a foot in the toilet.
I look over. Janis is at the kitchen table playing quarte against herself.
her insides are stronger than any bullet.
I'll tell you that much.
be honest-- would you be making the same decision if you didn't know this patient personally?
5-0 vicryl.
let me get this straight
you blacked out after five drinks, and they let you keep your badge?
that's... you know why?
because I'm always right about everything.
it's like the hand on mark's board.
trick or treat!
Hey, guys.
dig in, cowboy, princess.
a very cool costume.
And?
Hey!
it's my house, too.
you really should see a dentist.
my parents couldn't afford braces.
thanks for coming out tonight.
I love Halloween.
and, uh, I was worried about you.
it's good to see you out doing normal stuff.
Yeah, I think it's a good idea for all of us to start...
let's get going! - Okay.
paying a little bit more...watch her.
Hey!
stop! FBI! Stay where you are!
same hand, only this one's missing some fingers.
and, um, the other way.
that was the orientation on our assailant.
am I crazy, or does it look like it's pointing that way?
I just threw some toilet paper!
where did you get this mask?
99 cents store, man.
you're not gonna call my dad, are you?
Yeah, Nicole?
I'll be right there. - Makes sense.
you run an underground club, you want to make sure only the right people find it.
if the hand's positioning is the direction, why the missing fingers?
the last hand had three fingers, right?
we just drove three blocks.
that's it.
nice.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I tried Olivia first.
she's in surgery.
you did the right thing.
he came out of nowhere, and he had on this hospital bracelet that I was able to get off and call his dad.
he's on his way over.
I'm mark.
what's your name?
my name is Dylan.
my favorite book is "Harry Potter," prisoners of Azkaban.
my dad does magic.
okay, um, Dylan, does your dad know you're here?
this is my house, too.
no, Dylan, this is my house, and I'm trying to find out how you got here from the hospital.
go ahead. It's your house, too.
how did you know this address?
to our friends at 25696 sawyer court, "Los Angeles, California, 90024.
Hey, Dylan! - Hi, Charlie.
nuts to you, Squirrlio!
toot, toot!
what was that?
it's from the cartoon.
Charlie, do you-- do you know Dylan from school?
no, he's just my friend.
what?
hello.
I think my son is here.
Yeah, he's right here.
come on in.
Oh, my god. Are you all right?
he seems fine. - He just slipped out of the hospital.
I-I can't believe he'd just wander off.
um, thank you for taking such good care of him...Mr...
and I didn't catch your name.
this is my son Dylan.
wait.
are you somehow related to Olivia -- dr. Benford?
I'm her husband.
of-- of course.
that-- that makes perfect sense
your name being Benford, her name being Benford.
trick or treat!
Hey, honey.
you're her.
not yet.
you know, Charlie... Why don't we double check your candy in the kitchen?
Nicole, you want to come? - good idea.
what's going on?
I thought you might know.
Dylan came here.
Why?
this is my house, too.
it's your house, too, Dylan.
he keeps saying that.
Dylan is autistic the repetitive speech... - I don't need a diagnosis.
now I understand.
what?
why I made her-- Why I made you so
uncomfortable? - Yes.
okay, clearly, um, this is an unusual situation.
no kidding. - Mark, don't be like that.
I can make this comfortable for everybody.
you leave... you don't come back.
I'm very sorry if we've caused you any inconvenience.
thank you... both... for the kindness you've shown Dylan.
thank you.
it's my house, too.
good night, Olivia.
come on, Dylan.
let's go. - Good night, Dylan.
looks like the party's over.
definitely over.
this came from a friend of yours named Maya... worried about you.
you okay?
when I got shot...
the bullet... bounced around all over the place.
the only thing they said they could do without taking the whole thing out...
Olivia did this thing called a b-lynch.
but with all the scarring...
they said that it's gonna be almost impossible...
why am I crying?
I never even wanted to have a baby.
it's gonna be all right.
I can see why you like him. He's very charming.
I don't like M. Come on.
can you stop so we can actually talk about this?
I don't like him.
he's the father of one of my patients. - I know who he is.
what I want to know is how his son found his way here.
I have no idea.
Really?
Yeah.
well, I'm a little confused, because I thought you said you had Dylan moved off your rotation.
I did.
you did?
then why are you listed as the attending on his wristband?
Oh, god.
I had nothing to do with that. My boss made the decision.
your boss also tell you not to say anything about it?
no, I didn't say anything about it because I thought it would make a horrendous situation that much worse.
Oh, so you thought hiding it was a better plan.
that's not what was going on, mark.
don't turn me into someone I'm not.
don't you turn this around and make it about me.
the man you might be sleeping with in six months' time was just in our living room, and I sure as hell didn't bring him into our lives.
you did!
that's not fair.
just be honest.
just be honest.
have -- have you been talking to him at work?
Oh, come on!
come on, Mark.
have you done anything else I should know about?
mark, don't interrogate me.
then be honest with me!
I am!
are you being honest with me?
Oh, what are you talking about?
all the old patterns are back, mark.
you're out of the house all the time.
you're more and more secretive.
so I'm asking you the same thing that you asked me... be honest.
are you hiding anything from me?
in my flash-forward... I was drinking.
here we are again.
Olivia this isn't like before.
the lying's already started.
what?
no, it hasn't.
this isn't the same. Don't condemn me for something I haven't done yet.
did you even hear what you just said?
you've been punishing me this whole time for an imaginary relationship.
but when it comes back to you, you want to be let off the hook.
but our past together, mark-- all we've been through with your drinking... that's real.
that still hurts.
I'm not going through it again.
I promise you... I'm not gonna drink.
but it's not about the drinking.
you know that.
it's about trust.
it's about trust, and we don't trust each other anymore.
so, everything we said at the hospital today about only living in the moment, well... all that was a lie?
it's not a lie.
it's what I want.
I just don't know if it's possible anymore...
not now... not with us.
Hey, Demetri?
am I missing something?
I mean, on the same night our guy tries to kill Janis, he's hanging out here?
I don't know, but they found this on one of the bodies.
remember the Rutherford case?
we were talking about a case that I don't think even exists yet -- the Rutherford case.
it begins tonight.
all right.
it was quite a day, huh?
is it gonna be Halloween again tomorrow?
no.
just today.
good, 'cause it was kind of scary.
Yeah.
Yes, it was.
I'll see you in the morning.
thanks for coming to get me, daddy.
Oh, damn it, Simon. You scared me half to death.
did you ever take the train down the coast, Loyd?
breathtaking.
what do you want?
you disappear to Los Angeles.
you don't return my calls.
I'm worried about you.
we all are.
Yeah, well, I made it perfectly clear I don't want to see any of you right now.
I don't care.
we have to talk.
our experiment killed 20 million people, Simon.
what more is there to say?
repeat-- all units, all frequencies, stand by.
all 16-Adam units, stand by. CHP are in pursuit.
westbound 210 Freeway approaching Paxton.
westbound 210 Freeway approaching Paxton.
16-Adam-12 reports vehicle is in excess of 100 miles an hour.
vehicle is exiting the freeway at Paxton.
repeat-- vehicle is exiting the freeway at Paxton.
suspect is wanted for evading.
all units stand by.
it has been more than a year since the Rodney King beating.
the twelve jurors in the trial of the four white officers...
have just returned with a verdict...
after deliberating for several days.
the four officers accused of assaulting Rodney King...
are on the way to the courthouse here in Simi Valley...
along with their lawyers.
as soon as they get here, the judge will call the jury...
back into the courtroom...
and the clerk will begin to read the verdicts.
we expect it will happen very, very soon.
on the other side of the courthouse...
a large crowd is developing.
these are people who have been monitoring this trial.
they are anxious to find out what the verdict is.
there it is. Come on.
hang a "U." Turn around.
Jack O'Hearts. That's it.
they ain't getting off.
the jury don't have fucking eyes?
Rodney King's getting his ass beaten, man.
they beating the black out of homeboy's ass.
bust me.
you ragweed-mouth motherfucker.
check this shit out. I wouldn't give a fuck...
if it was motherfucking Martin Luther King...
got clapped off, nigga, it don't matter.
ain't no brothers on that jury out there, fucker.
it's Simi Valley.
all good, decent white folk like yourself.
that's why they moved the venue. The cops are protected.
it's on videotape. You can't fuck with that.
they going down.
if they go down, I'll buy you some old-fashioned black pussy.
if them motherfuckers walk, you gotta spot me a ho.
and no white ho. I want a Puerto Rican.
where you gonna find a Puerto Rican in L. A?
I'll get you some Mexican shit.
I don't want no clumsy-ass Mexican.
I want me a badass Puerto Rican bitch.
I don't give a fuck if you gotta swim.
let's shake. It's about that time.
we do this short, simple, and clean.
detective Keough...
if you had a little time machine...
and you could travel back to the day of the shooting...
to the afternoon that you killed Mr. Robertson...
I'd like to hear what you'd do differently.
I wouldn't do anything differently, sir.
he drew down on me. I did what I was trained to do.
if anything, sir, I should've acted quicker.
the last man Robertson pulled a gun on isn't with us anymore.
thank you, Detective.
I think we've kept Detective Keough long enough.
chief Barcomb, I have a few questions.
fire away, Chief Holland.
I know it's been a long day...
and I know those chairs aren't well-padded...
so I promise to be quick.
you OK?
three weeks in SlS...
and you've made your first kill.
would you say you've proven yourself?
respectfully, sir...
I think the shooting board has to decide that.
do you think it could've been avoided?
no, sir, I don't.
it says here that you and your partner...
had Mr. Robertson bumper-locked...
for two days before the shooting.
why didn't you bust him for the weapon?
because we weren't sure he had the weapon.
the informant who told us is highly unreliable.
but you tailed him anyway for 680 man-hours.
he was on parole. You could've shaken him down...
but you let a two-time felon stroll around downtown L. A...
with a. 357 Magnum stuck in his jeans.
Why? Why?
we didn't want to get him on a bullshit weapons charge.
thank you, Chief Holland. We have to wrap it up.
officer Garcia, will you bring Sergeant Perry in?
sergeant Perry, we're not quite through beating up on you.
I have one final question before we adjourn.
time machine, sir?
Yes, the time machine.
chief, I'd get real proactive.
if I had a time machine...
I'd go back a decade and take out G-Bone
his street name-- before he killed a man for $10.
the time machine doesn't go back that far.
it goes back one week...
to the day Detective Keough chose to use deadly force.
what would you change about that day only?
nothing, sir. It was textbook.
the bullets were in the bad guys, not us.
we expect department personnel to use deadly force
only as a last resort, which it was, sir.
Bobby Keough's a good cop with a lot of potential...
and he dropped a menace to society.
it was a good call.
thank you.
thank you, Sergeant Perry, Detective Keough.
you gentlemen are dismissed.
we'll issue our findings at 9 A. M. tomorrow morning.
proceedings are closed.
call me.
it is the second full day of deliberations...
in the Rodney King beating trial.
no word on when the jury might reach a decision.
reporters, photographers and news media covering this case...
are sitting in the parking lot of the courthouse...
waiting until we get word that there is a verdict.
reporting live from the Simi Valley courthouse in
they should've wasted that worthless motherfucker's ass.
here. Settle your stomach.
Thanks, Jack.
how'd my nephew perform? - He aced it.
say hello to the department's new poster boy.
no, I'm telling you, I'll get suspended.
I'll end up being a fucking security guard at Taco Bell.
Bobby, you go down, I go down.
I go down, Jack goes down.
and Jack ain't going down...
so have some faith in the system.
a man is supposed to be nervous...
in front of his first shooting board.
listen, kid. Here's my advice...
for what it's worth.
live with it! - Jesus Christ.
good hands! - Held on to it.
I'm never going to live it down, am l?
don't go getting sad and weepy on us.
one mistake means you're human.
two mistakes means you're fired.
holy shit. It's a royal visit.
look what descended from the sixth floor.
Hey, Jimmy. - Jack.
how are you holding up, son?
I'm good, sir.
you should've seen this kid. He was outstanding.
ever thought about doing a tour with public affairs?
we could use a good-looking son of a bitch like you.
he's a good young cop, Jimmy, and he's mine.
well, I tried.
the board voted.
in policy.
you're off the hook, kid.
there you go. - Congratulations.
have a cigar.
the report will be ready in the morning.
you guys can get back into the field.
so, the vote...
the vote was four to one.
what? Who the fuck pissed backwards-- Holland?
Affirmatron.
I'd like to see his bald-headed black ass...
back in a radio car in South Central.
we don't need that shit.
he actually said "out of policy"?
Holland began contacting outside agencies a month ago.
he's doing civil service testing with the city of Cleveland.
he's leaving to run their P. D. Didn't hear it from me.
didn't hear it from you.
fuck Holland. Good riddance.
have to pin his stars on another brother...
or the community will go apeshit.
Jesus, Eldon, you sound like your old man.
it's true. - It's not such a bad thing.
everything I know--his old man.
a toast to Bobby. Right between the eyes.
thank you, guys. I mean it.
thanks for giving me the chance to prove myself in SlS.
Amen, Bobby. To Jack's squad.
Eldon, Jimmy has something to tell you.
you made lieutenant.
you're next on the transfer list.
fuck you, too, Jimmy.
no. We're not pulling your dick.
it's about fucking time.
it's about fucking time! All right!
Where's my badge?
the badge ceremony's Wednesday at the Academy.
a dozen lieutenants being promoted.
the biggest in department history...
if you can make it on time, Mr. Smart Ass.
I'll try to shove it into my busy schedule.
thanks for dropping by.
thanks for the cigars, Jimmy.
good luck, kid. - Thank you.
we'll hoist a few next week.
that'd be good, Jack, anytime.
looking forward to it.
that's our next chief, gentlemen.
that's a scary fucking thought.
I mean-- God help us.
I can't stand much more of that dump.
did you see that drunk tonight trying to paw me?
what drunk?
does it matter, what drunk?
what's the matter with you tonight, darling?
that's the third time you started to tell me something.
we shouldn't have any secrets from each other, Sue.
you're a fucking alcoholic.
Thanks.
there's goulash in the crockpot.
I'm not hungry.
did you just get home?
eleven prisoners got early releases.
I had to process them out.
Sal...
I made lieutenant.
you're kidding.
finally. - Yeah.
when will it show up on your paycheck?
not till after the ceremony, honey.
who the fuck is calling 900 numbers?
if it's anyone, it's you, and you don't remember.
the department tapes for manual labor.
watch this. It's the damn kid.
welcome to Sorority Slut Hot Line.
Yeah. Sorority Slut Hot Line.
fucking pay it. At least he's not a fag.
no, he's not a fag.
your damn kid has a girlfriend.
know that, Detective?
no. No shit?
she's very pretty, very sweet.
that's excellent. The boy's finding his dick.
I work in a jail. Do I have to listen to that at home?
OK, OK.
I'm sorry.
aren't you going to ask how the shooting board went?
aren't you going to at least ask me...
how the shooting board went?
I'm sorry, honey.
I have a hard time keeping track of all your shootings...
and investigations and interrogations and inquiries.
how did your shooting board go?
ln policy. - Like it would be anything else.
what is this? I recognize this.
I've seen it before somewhere.
Bobby's strutting around like a little bantam rooster.
you're just jealous of him because he's cute.
cute.
you are so lost in space...
you have no idea what the fuck's going on.
jealous of Bobby?
Bobby's a fucking coward.
Bobby's not a coward.
he's not?
OK.
chicken shit.
let me tell you how that Robertson case really went down.
my gun's gotta cool, because I blasted that freak in Pacoima.
it's time Bobby gets tested.
we're out there in this alley waiting.
robertson comes running out, smacks into Bobby.
they eyeball each other with their shit hanging out.
robertson says, "Boo," Bobby drops his gun...
and Mandingo goes track star.
Bobby dropped his fucking gun.
I don't want to hear this.
no, listen, because this is good.
so, I reach down, I pick up Bobby's gun...
and I go, Hey, yo, G-Dog!
or GQ, or whatever the fuck his name is.
he turns around and-- Boom!
I split this guy's eyeballs. It was a lucky shot.
the point is, I let Bobby take the triggerman slot...
to save his ass from big-time embarrassment!
how do you like that for "cute"?
fuck.
fuck it. Goulash? Oh, boy.
and you wonder why I drink.
Jesus Christ.
is that all you got?
Yeah, for now. For the moment.
man, you sure you're a cop?
just call me Sarge.
but no last name.
we've known each other for three weeks without last names.
I'm afraid if you tell me, you're going to...
what? Turn into a pumpkin?
something like that.
want to know my last name? - No.
no, I don't want to know your last name...
your division, your partner.
I like it like this.
nothing too serious...yet.
what just happened was pretty serious to me.
ready to go again?
whatever you say, Sarge.
that's what I'm talking about-- money.
orchard! Sidwell! - Did you hear that?
open up! I know you're in there!
orchard! Sidwell!
Where's the safe?
dump that shit.
Where's the money?
give me all the money now...
or I'll put you back in your cages.
this it? - Yeah.
what about our half?
I'm keeping your half...
because you couldn't control yourselves.
why did you dumb fucks kill those people?
what the fuck you think?
we're gonna let people walk out after they've seen us?
I don't give a fuck.
you live and breathe and walk the streets...
because of me and me alone.
you know that, don't you?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
your whore is dead. Dump her, too.
get off your asses.
I'm putting you in a fresh-blood case.
there was a quadruple homicide on Jefferson yesterday.
two coloreds fucked up a robbery.
monkeyshines. Why call us in?
the shit fairy paid me a visit. It's rolling downhill.
I hate it when the shit fairy visits.
one of the vic's was an LAPD dispatcher.
I got four bodies in the morgue.
this Rodney King shit has the department...
on the ropes, so get these gorillas.
show the world LAPD looks after its own.
Eldon, can we do this?
sure, Jack, we can do this.
help the guys out in South Bureau.
peltz and Sapin. They're overworked.
they'll be happy if SlS take point on this.
Bobby. - Yes, sir.
this could be a second chance for you.
I hope so, sir.
what's the deal with this new girl, Bobby?
what are you talking about?
I am a detective. Give me some credit.
what's her name? - Beth.
what's she do? -I don't know.
she works in the building.
bullshit. She's a cop.
I bet she's the only blue suiter...
who didn't drop her drawers when you flashed your shield...
and now you're intrigued.
I'm more than intrigued. Remember the stenographer?
Bobby, don't do that. You fucking idiot.
you'll regret that when you're my age.
I'm sure I will.
the latest now on the Rodney King beating trial...
Hey, Lefty. Let's see.
I'll have a...
couple of coffees, regular. - Two black coffees.
can we turn this shit down? - Thanks, man.
guys, getting your swerve on?
Eldon, what's shaking?
no, that's fine.
so, how's Sally?
Sal? She's my angel.
what brings you south of King?
please tell me Jack gave you our case.
van Meter's all over this one.
he wants us to help you guys out.
Eldon, it's dog shit.
it's crazy-man stuff.
these dumbasses hotfooted it without tapping the till.
hypes or cranksters. They gotta be ex-cons.
any wits? - The fifth victim.
did you interview him?
no. He's in surgery at Drew King.
metro's on him 24 hours.
that's all we know. You're welcome to it.
all right, partner.
gentlemen, thanks for the help.
thanks a lot, guys. - You bet.
keep ducking.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
they called again about the shooting board report.
send it back without my endorsement.
attach this cover letter.
do you know what you're doing?
declaring war.
that's crazy. You can't upstage a hard-ass like Van Meter.
he has a weak spot-- Eldon Perry.
weak don't come to mind when I think of that redneck.
Perry and his little partner...
iied through their teeth for eight hours straight.
Perry killed Robertson, not his partner...
and I'm going to prove it.
I'm going to get their badges. Will you help me?
whatever you want.
I need copies of every piece of paper with Perry's name on it.
every ratings report, every division log...
payroll, medical, commendations, everything.
his partner, too.
Arthur, this is some dangerous shit.
Sailboats-- I don't understand them.
I prefer a big boat with a big motor...
on a big lake behind a big dam.
how about you, Arthur? You a motor or sail guy?
I don't like boats, and I don't like you.
has this department been so bad to you...
you feel driven to humiliate it?
don't hide behind LAPD blue.
it's not your color.
no one buys your sudden transformation...
into this beacon of higher consciousness and moral right.
the last thing your ham-fisted political ploy...
will get you is four stars.
you should rethink this-- very seriously.
very seriously.
I know how you fight.
I'm ready for you.
we can handle this like gentlemen...
or we can get into some nigger shit.
so you do whatever it is you feel you have to do.
I plan to, nigger.
they didn't get a dime?
no. They're crazy.
they shoot and run.
they're like dogs. They have no heart.
no, sir, they don't.
you have any problems with anybody in particular...
in the neighborhood-- any troublemakers?
no video, huh?
camera not work.
what's upstairs there, apartment?
I live with my daughter.
my wife...
we married 22 years.
Mr. Kim, we will get the guys that did this.
give me a call if there's anything you need.
we're here to help. - Thank you.
please. Excuse me.
it's all right, man.
what are you doing?
I'm just getting a feel for the scene.
how'd it go down, Sherlock?
I don't get it.
one suspect kills Mrs. Kim and hops the counter.
shooter two pops each vic as they walk in.
this is what I don't get.
he moves the bodies over here...
hiding them from the street.
that must've taken some time.
keep going.
all right.
outside they run into Mr. Lewis.
one of them shoots him in the neck.
they get into the car and they're gone.
I'm sorry. That does not make any sense.
it never does, Bobby.
what do we do now?
why don't you ask Mr. Kim for a broom...
and bag everything in this gutter for the lab?
let's get that gutter, too.
heads up.
let's jack these motherfuckers and rattle some cages.
what's up, Maniac? - Ain't nothing happening.
you know I be shaking it down.
Yeah. - What it look like, man?
I'm trying to get my paper, that's what it is.
up against the wall, boys. You know the drill.
let's go. Palms on the bricks.
man, we ain't do nothing.
you, in the gorilla suit, turn around.
turn the fuck around, man.
man, I ain't do nothing.
think this bullet gives a shit how tough you are?
you're under arrest. -For what?
give me your elbow! Don't do that!
hook him up. Let's go.
calm the fuck down, man.
fuck you, man. - Calm the fuck down!
what the fuck I did?
why did you shoot my car?
I ain't shoot your fucking-- Oh, man!
get in there. Let's go, come on.
get down. Get in there.
man, that shit sting!
I know, man, he's crazy.
just cooperate with us. What's your name?
maniac, man. They call me Maniac.
who the fuck are you, Metro?
Yeah, we're Metro. I'm Detective Smith.
this is my homeboy, Detective Jones.
somebody dropped a dime on you, big guy.
you robbed a liquor store and dumped four good citizens.
now your ass is getting gassed.
why you running that bullshit at me?
how about this?
you're fucking killing me with that shit.
I'll find an alley and empty this can up his nose.
he's fucking crazy, all right?
man, fuck him! - He'll do it again.
he cool-ass people.
he be throwing us out with 40s and shit.
we keep our eye out for him.
somebody came in blasting the other day...
on a civilian, man. That shit ain't cool.
speak fucking English!
he's a good dude, bro, so we gonna handle this.
shut the fuck up. I want to know who did this.
if you help me bring these guys down...
I'll bust a doper and give you his shit.
two motherfuckers that ain't from around here.
somebody gonna get drunk and brag about it.
he went up against Mr. Kim and did his wife.
why is somebody gonna do that?
because he a player. He got game.
game? What's he play, golf? Speak fucking English!
word on the street, he got strip club...
Iadies and stuff like that.
he selling that flat-ass booty.
you're telling me fucking bedtime stories.
check it out, cop.
hold still now.
this hurts a lot less without a broken nose.
I told you! Kim's a straight-up gangster!
he a pimp like that.
I hope you're not fucking with me, Maniac.
ed, it's Detective Smith.
Yeah. Do a make for me?
Yeah. Thanks, Ed.
kim's in the gang book.
suspicion of loan sharking and pandering.
he's got a club on Olympic, just like you said.
unhook him.
where you going?
I gave you what you wanted, right?
what do you want?
I want a goddamn cheeseburger.
Tommy's or Fatburger?
Fatburger, double king with cheese.
sounds good. Let's go. Get in.
he's tripping, huh?
shit, I'm getting in the front seat this time.
so, you little sneak...
you're smitten with this broad with no last name...
and you're dumping stenographers.
but I don't know anything about her?
sometimes you're clueless.
you'll make a great Pogue someday.
how about a fifth of scotch over here?
I admit it, Bobby.
I get played now and then because I'm trusting.
I like giving people the benefit of the doubt.
when my trust is abused...
it drives me out of my fucking mind.
not as much as she's driving me out of my mind.
she's black, Eldon.
that's why I don't talk about her.
you be dating a sister.
I didn't know you were an ebony and ivory man.
I don't want to hear a bunch of black jokes.
amigo, you think I care about...
the size, shape, color, or political party...
of some sweet thing you're rolling around with?
while you're thinking about pussy...
I'm talking about Henry Kim...
and his "struggling immigrant from South Central" tap dance.
he's a gangster.
think it was a hit on his wife?
it wasn't a hit.
it would've been in and out, a couple of vics.
these guys lingered.
back to robbery.
I bet this place moves five or six Gs of pussy weekdays...
and double that on weekends.
that's a lot of cash, Bobby.
let's go fishing.
what do you want?
half an hour ago, I wanted this drink...
now I want to fuck that girl.
sorry, she can't do that.
find me one that can, slick.
you got eight girls here. You're not pimping them?
I'm not talking to you.
you're LAPD. You beat Rodney King.
I did not kick Rodney King's ass...
but I'll have some serious fun kicking your ass!
did you take Kim's money, you son of a bitch?
talk to me!
did you put on a ski mask and take his damn money?
get the fuck back inside! Now!
did you kill his fucking wife?
no, no, no! I didn't do that!
get the fuck out of here now!
now! Move! Now!
his family is like my family. I didn't steal!
I heard they got 200 grand.
no, look, they took a safe.
but it only has 1 50.
anybody show up for work late this morning?
anybody in your little sewing circle blow town?
give me a fucking name!
du Ku. He's not home. I don't know where he is.
this guy doesn't own one fucking chair?
there's nothing in there.
Holy...fuck.
Oh, man.
I guess that's what they mean by chilling out.
shit. - They tortured this guy.
he sang, man. - He hit a high fucking "C.
all right.
our bad guys have turned on to Henry Kim's business somehow.
snatched the bag man...
tortured him to find out where the money was hidden.
they go in, kill four people...
come out, wing a fifth...
torch the getaway car...
and take off in a second set of wheels.
this thing's coming together, Bobby.
let's call this in and take another shot at Kim.
Yeah, good.
morning, Matt.
morning, Sergeant.
here.
thank you.
the verdict might be today.
I bet they get off.
that's my opinion. What about you?
Jesus, you talk about everything else...
from dog racing to foreign policy.
how come you never talk about the King thing?
Bobby, I avoid the subject...
because it pains me to see real criminals free...
while four of my brothers eat political shit...
because the Pogues outlawed the choke hold.
when they got rid of the choke hold...
it left us with a stun gun and a baton.
the choke hold saved lives...
but nobody ever got elected saying that.
they don't give those guys enough cars, radios...
equipment or live bodies to man the watches.
then they take away the tactics that work...
and indict them for using approved tactics that don't?
Bobby, this is simple.
either four good cops are going down...
because they followed the department manual...
or they get off and we're back in the Summer of '65.
I don't know about that. You really think so?
if they get off, this city burns.
Perry.
I got it. Let's go.
the wit's conscious.
freeway bags for these?
how's he doing?
in the last couple of hours, he's moved around a bit.
good.
Mr. Lewis, how you doing?
I'm Detective Keough. This is Detective Perry.
sir, we'd like to ask you a couple questions.
he's whacked out on painkillers.
he can't speak. His larynx has been removed.
the bullet shattered it.
sir, can you write?
here.
Mr. Lewis, could you identify the race of the attackers?
one was white, and one was black.
Hey, Jack.
Hi, guys.
brief me on Jack O'Hearts.
I've been getting calls all day.
my two best guys are on it, giving 200%.
tell me you got the suspects in your trunk.
my trunk has nothing but a spare tire and underwear.
you gotta have some breaks.
I interviewed the "K" who owns the crime scene...
who I sniffed out as a lesser light of the underworld...
and it turns out he's got a strip club.
he's pandering, a cash-and-carry businessman...
and he had a safe with a buck-fifty in it.
that's real money. You guys found a body.
kim's bag man. - Your shooters are Korean.
that's what we thought till we interviewed the wit.
he can't lD them. They had ski masks.
he can lD race. It was a salt-and-pepper team.
a safecracking spook and a blue-eyed peckerwood.
who does that sound like?
how about Orchard and Sidwell?
always Orchard and Sidwell with you.
what is that?
you're not dumping my two best informants.
Jack, your pets, your science projects
whatever the fuck they are-- the evil shits did this.
it's time we put these slick twists down.
your job is not to think.
it is to follow orders, to execute plans...
and to be a good soldier.
you're a goddamn great soldier...
because you leave the planning and fixing to me.
are you listening? - I'm listening, Jack.
listen to my philosophy. It's very simple.
I am a performer of unpleasant tasks...
so that the majority of people...
are free to perform pleasant ones.
the last thing I care about is what you think.
I got it, Jack.
good. Open your fucking ears.
orchard and Sidwell were in San Diego working for me.
you and Bobby will do whatever it takes...
to clear Jack O'Hearts.
find some bad guys and get a search warrant!
you listening? - I'm listening, Jack.
you better be listening!
I don't need you making shit up!
take the warrant and serve it with Rico's platoon.
do what you do.
OK?
OK? - OK.
where are you going?
OK. OK.
it'll be a beautiful thing.
pull this off, you'll be sitting on waterskis...
sucking fumes from my new boat...
a couple of kegs and hookers in Lake Havasu.
stick this in Holland's mailbox...
and get your asses back on the street.
forget finding the real guys? Did I hear that right?
Hey, Perry.
you guys get anywhere with that Jack O'Hearts case?
we just had a breakthrough. How are you guys doing?
just got a drive-by murder-suicide
a 12-year-old wasted an ice cream truck driver.
another normal day.
good luck nailing those bastards.
keep us posted.
sit down, Bobby.
we're going to find a couple of assholes...
and bury them in the Jack O'Hearts.
we cannot pin four murders on patsies.
no fucking way.
the real shooters need to be taken off the streets.
I absolutely agree with you.
they're vermin and should be exterminated.
but you got a crime and you got criminals...
and if you're meticulous, somehow you make a match.
we're in the getting-shit-done business.
what are you talking about? You know who did it.
come on!
how can Jack involve us in this type of shit?
what the hell's he thinking? - How fucking dare you!
who the fuck are you to question Jack Van Meter?
you don't question his orders. You follow them!
I ought to kick your ass, man!
you know jack, Bobby!
you were tested and failed!
that's my daddy's gun.
you see those? Eleven men.
he and Jack were partners...
and the only goddamn reason this city's here...
is because they made it possible.
they built it with bullets!
hunted down evil fucking parasites...
that would've committed thousands of crimes...
would've ruined hundreds of lives.
they protected the good people, Bobby...
so that they could grow and not the cancer!
who the fuck are you to question anybody?
Eldon, please. Take it easy!
come on, take it easy. I'm with you.
good. - We're going to do this.
OK?
how do we get a search warrant?
sergeant Perry?
I'm from the paper. You got a minute?
no.
I heard SlS is attached to the Jack O'Hearts killings.
that's a little overkill, don't you think?
is there some political motivation here?
I know you've said you've been misquoted in the past.
that's why I brought a tape recorder.
you give me a quote, and I'll run it...
exactly as you say it-- word for word.
the question is this
why has an elite force like SlS been asked to solve...
a routine multiple robbery homicide in South Central?
unless there's something that we don't know about.
quote
get your fucking head out of my ass...
and stop writing that cocksucking criminals...
are victims, instead of the pigs they are...
and let motherfucking cops do what motherfucking cops do.
end quote. Print that.
Hey, Deena.
sergeant.
how you doing? I'm Detective Keough.
Hi. Good to meet you.
what brings SlS to my office?
the quadruple on Jefferson...
and a linked mayhem homicide in Koreatown.
dead dispatcher. - That yours?
we're helping out South Bureau. You know Peltz and Sapin?
the Bourbon Brothers? Good Homicide guys.
we're taking point because they're overloaded.
we found the gentlemen that did it.
we need a search warrant.
better have more than on that Hollywood Hills double.
I got hell from the judge on that one.
you could finish the story.
his Honor signed, and I nailed the bastard.
you got lucky. Let's see what you got.
it's a little thin, but these are some bad hombres.
this guy sodomized an 80-year-old woman for two days.
this one raped a little girl in front of her family...
during a home invasion. Read the file.
calling these circumstantial would be a compliment.
I can't issue on this. No judge will sign it.
we're not going to trial, for Christ's sake.
it's a search warrant. There's probable cause.
don't bullshit me. I can't process this.
you can process it... and you will.
and by tomorrow morning...
those two young bucks will be dressed out...
and strapped across the hood of my Chevy.
so says the playbook, Deena, so do it.
be a team player.
Jesus Christ, you got Alzheimer's?
you know the deal.
you want to change it?
give me your phone.
do you have any shame? - I try not to.
I'll issue the search warrant, but no judge will sign it.
the judge is my problem.
we'll wait, Deena.
fine.
I'm lost. What just happened?
Deena went to USC.
good sorority, Dean's list, the whole thing.
she's a sharp gal, but like a lot of young girls...
away from home for the first time...
she experimented and got into team sports.
the whole football team, man.
fight on for old S. C!
it was a hell of a videotape. I never saw it.
she married some CEO from Century City who doesn't know...
and that's the way she wants to keep it.
and that's the deal.
there's always a deal.
judge Russo, I'm sorry.
I really appreciate this, sir.
you're sure about this one?
these guys are a couple of sick puppies, Your Honor.
it's all here if you want to read it.
raise your right hand and repeat after me.
as the affiant, do you swear that everything...
contained in this affidavit is true...
to the best of your knowledge...
so help you God? - I do.
how's Sally? - She's great.
Mrs. Russo feeling better?
much better, thank you.
this is Bobby Keough, my new partner.
judge Russo. - Hi.
great. Thank you very much, sir.
appreciate it.
sign out a car and paint "Enola Gay" on the side...
because we're gonna drop the bomb on Holland.
take a look at these.
who's the female?
Beth Williamson-- LAPD Sergeant.
she's Holland's assistant.
who took them?
me.
some people call that "doggy-style.
I like "Bow wow wow.
call this one Girl on top.
wait. Who's wearing the high heels here?
and let's see. Oh, yeah. Missionary.
although I am not quite sure what religion that would be.
what do you want me to do with these?
stick them in Holland's mailbox.
then you're off till 21：00. Get some sack time.
you look like shit, Bobby.
I'll see you.
what's up with the blue suit?
public relations.
so people see everyone who wears it...
isn't like you, Detective.
would you like a menu?
why don't you tell Holland he's a great pimp?
what the hell are you talking about?
I think I was falling for you.
Yeah, I really do.
do you deny you're sleeping with him?
the secret files. The gossip.
the dirty little stories whispered...
in the men's rooms and hallways of Parker Center.
you're a part of that? - I know what happened.
he was my station house fling.
I was a patrol supervisor, and I was attracted to him.
I thought he was a great man.
it was a brief affair.
then he told me he wasn't leaving his wife.
that was five years ago.
we walked away like adults.
it's long over, and it is my business, his business...
and not yours or anyone else's.
Yeah, it is my business.
it is my business when you're spying on me.
you're the goddamn spy.
you work for Van Meter, not me.
who approached who first?
I never wanted to know anything about your work.
I never asked.
now... I know more than I want to.
what do you know?
chill, man.
honey, we're running late.
I want out of the marriage, Arthur.
listen.
please, just listen.
I'm glad the time you put into the department...
is paying off for you.
but the time I put into you isn't paying off for me.
I want to have a life while I still can.
don't worry. I'm still down for you, baby.
I think you'll make a wonderful Chief...
and I'll do my part to help you make it.
and when you do...
I don't see myself staying around.
I'm sorry.
that happened five years ago.
you know it. We dealt with it.
you said you would forgive me and try to forget.
it's hard to forget when you got a mailbox full of those.
I didn't know about those pictures.
LAPD doesn't miss a trick, does it?
is it possible to have a secret inside that department?
no.
Perry, you know the Xs and Os.
you'll be in the observation post in the alley.
you guys are lucky the verdicts didn't come in today...
or we'd be in the south end on standby.
it took my guys a day to locate these assholes...
and two more days to pat them down.
we finally tailed them into Charcoal Alley.
you know Bobby Keough, my number two on this one.
how you doing? - Yeah, I know Bobby.
congratulations on the shooting board.
you ever get tired of SlS, come down to Metro.
we could always use a good man.
that's not gonna happen, but thanks.
what do you say we hit the bricks?
what's going on, man? This ain't your style.
political as it gets, Rico.
they want this one on the front page...
so make as much noise as you want.
I'd like to introduce a member of our congregation...
who has spoken to us on many occasions...
assistant Los Angeles Police Chief Arthur Holland.
praise the Lord!
ladies, listen up.
Perry and Keough will give you some background on the players.
these are the two shitbirds that took out...
one of our dispatchers and a few other innocents.
no one fucks with our family.
and remember-- SlS doesn't have a jail...
so if you knock one of these pricks down...
make sure he stays down.
I remember one fine spring day...
about 25 years ago.
I had just graduated from the Police Academy.
I felt so proud with my brand new blues...
coming to church that Sunday.
I felt so proud with my new badge on my chest.
bottom line, gentlemen, watch your asses...
and pay attention to your fields of fire.
once we have secured the location...
we turn it over to Perry and his people.
sergeant, take over.
a couple of weeks ago...
some gentlemen from Cleveland called me.
they wanted me to move out to Ohio...
to become the Chief of their police department.
that opportunity is knocking mighty loud...
and my LAPD badge doesn't seem to glow anymore...
and I'm not as proud of my blues as I used to be.
today, I called those gentlemen in Cleveland...
and I told them I'm staying put.
questions?
we'll be pulling out in 15 minutes.
I stand before you tonight...
to declare my goal of becoming...
the first African-American Police Chief of Los Angeles.
what happens if they take these guys alive?
getting out alive isn't part of the drill.
no, I know.
for all I know, you'll hand these dicks your Roscoe...
and they'll shove it up your ass.
shut the fuck up about that. I'm serious.
shut the fuck up about it.
hate me right now? - You're damn right!
good. Stay in that zone.
what are you doing? - Calling the suspects.
Why?
making sure they're up. You can't shoot a man in bed.
Hey, dumb ass, take a look out your window.
the cops are crawling all over your place.
flash bang!
on the ground now! Get the fuck down!
all right! - Get your fucking hands up!
all right! I'm cool.
get the fuck down! Now!
take my piece. There you go. Here.
there you go. Safety's off.
you drill him, I'll take the heat.
who's that?
all right Hey!
take this worthless piece of shit down right now!
I never did shit to you.
shut up! - Be cool.
shut the fuck up! -I ain't got no gun.
go to work, Bobby! We're running out of time.
man, go to work! We're running out of time here!
I ain't got a gun. - What?
the King's Speech
you're live in two minutes. Your Royal Highness
sir
thank you
let the microphone do the work, sir.
I am sure you will be splendid. Just take your time.
time to go.
good afternoon.
this is the BBC National Programme and Empire Services taking you to Wembley Stadium for the Closing Ceremony of the Empire Exhibition.
where His Royal Highness the Duke of York will read a message from the his father, his Majesty, King George the fifth.
58 British Colonies and Dominions have taken part, making this the largest Exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
your Majesty, 3 flashes, and steady red means you're live.
using the new invention of radio
the Opening Ceremony was the first time his Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
at the close of the first Season
the air to the throne His Royal Highness the Prince Wales made his first broadcast
and today, his younger brother his Royal Highness, the Duke of York will give his inaugural broadcast to the Nation and the World.
I have received from his Majesty the...the...the ...the King
inhale deep into your lungs, your Royal Highness.
relaxes your larynx, does it not?
cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.
if Your Highness will be so kind as to open your hand...
sterilized.
Now...if I may take the liberty?
...Insert them into your mouth.
excuse me, Doctor. What is the purpose of this?
it's the classic approach that cured Demosthenes.
that was in Ancient Greece. Has it worked since?
now if you would be so kind as to read. A wealth of words.
fight against those marbles Your Royal Highness.
enunciate!
a little more concentration your Royal Highness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
thank you so much, Doctor, it's been most interesting.
your Royal Highness
insert marbles!
he can insert his own bloody marbles...!
tick, tock, tick, tock.
you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
I know. Promise me
promise me: no more.
Harley Street
Dr. Chapman, L Logue, Speech Defects
australia is calling; Sydney bridge celebrations mar 1932
hello. Is anyone there?
I'm just in the loo.
hello Mrs Johnson, there you are.
sorry I don't have receptionist. I like to keep things simple "Poor and content is rich and rich enough"
for?
Shakespeare. How are you?
how do you do
ahh, traveling alone
now, this is slightly awkward
but I'm afraid you're late.
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
Where's Mr Johnson?
he doesn't know I'm here.
that's not a very promising start.
no. My husband has seen everyone to no avail. He's given up hope.
he hasn't seen me.
you're awfully sure of yourself.
I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
of course he wants to be cured.
my husband is required to speak publicly.
perhaps he should change jobs.
he can't.
indentured servitude?
something of that nature. Yes
well we need to have your hubby pop by...
tuesday would be good...
he can give me his personal details and I'll make a frank appraisal.
and then we can take it from there
doctor, forgive me.
I do not have a "hubby." We don't 'pop."
and nor do we never talk about our private lives.
you must come to us.
sorry, Mrs J, my game, my turf, my rules.
you'll have to talk over with your husband
and then you can speak to me on the telephone
thank you very much for dropping by.
good afternoon
and what if my husband were the Duke of York?
the Duke of York?
yes the Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for "Johnson"?
forgive me, your Royal...? -- Highness.
your Royal Highness.
johnson was used during the Great War when the navy didn't want the enemy to know 'he" was aboard.
am I considered the enemy?
you will be if you remain un-obliging.
you'll appreciate the need for absolutely discretion
of course.
how did you find me? Your Royal Highness
the President of the Society for Speech Therapists
Eileen McCleod? She's a sport.
she warned me your antipodean methods were "unorthodox and controversial."
I warned her...they were not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
but for my method to work
I need trust and total equality here in the safety of my consultation room.
no exceptions.
well then, in that case...
when can you start?
still sounds a bit rough.
you make me drive too slowly, Dad!
did you pick mum up from Bridge?
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
may I be please leave the table?
how special is special?
you must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents" inane conversation.
Thanks, dad!
and mum. --And mum!
me too -- You're meeting Jean?
no, someone else
doctor? Doctor? Don't you help you brother with the washing up
I'm fine
who is it Lionel?
why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
myrtle, just a woman looking to help her husband.
and I had a 'call." For an audition -- One of my favourates.-- Aren't they all.
could be a lot of fun -- I'm sure you'll be splendid
in the amateur scene, they're a highly regarded group
from Putney.
that's all girls. Tomorrow, Chapter 4, The Flight --I long to know they fly to -- I can't wait
Oh, to fly away!
weren't they lucky!
now Papa tell a story!
could I be a penguin instead?
now I want to a penguin story.
very quickly
once there were two princesses
princesses Elisabeth, and Princesses Margret
their papa was a penguin
this was because he been turned into by a wicked witch
this was inconvenient for him because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms and you can't do that if you're a penguin, because you have wings like herrings.
herrings don't have wings.
penguins have wings which like the shape of herrings.
and what make matters worse she sent him to the South Pole which is an awfully long walk back if you can't fly.
when he reached the water
he dived in, through the depth so fast that he was in Southampton Waters by lunchtime.
from there he took the 2. 30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction and asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.
he swam up the Thames and out through the plughole, giving the cook mama and Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.
when the girls heard all the commotion
they run to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
and as they kissed him guess what he turned into?
a handsome prince!
a short-tailed Albatross.
with wings big enough that he could wrap them both around his two girls together
now girls, time for bed. Come on
take the horses to the stable
you have exactly a minute
good night feed them brush them and to bed.
will Mrs Simpson be there?
my brother's insisting.
is he serious?
about our coming to dinner?
no. About her!
a married woman? He can't be.
she can. By the way I think I found someone rather interesting.
on Harley Street. A doctor.
out of the question. I'm not having this conversation again.
the matter's settled.
his approach seems rather different...
now?
now!
"now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer by this sun of York."
and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
thank you.
lovely diction, Mr...
Logue. Lionel Logue.
well, Mr Logue,
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.
Sydney? --Perth.
major theater town, is it? -- Enthusiastic.
Ah. -- I was well reviewed.
Yes...well...Lionel,
I think our dramatic society is looking for someone slightly younger and a little more regal.
you have to shut that one first.
close that one first, that
where did you find this...physician?
classifieds, next to "French model, Shepherd's Market."
he comes highly recommended.
charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?!
he has no receptionist. He likes to keep things simple.
the Johnsons.
you can go in now, "Mr. Johnson."
Lionel says...wait here if you wish, Mrs Johnson.
or, it being a p-pleasant day, p-perhaps take a stroll.
was that alright...Lionel?
marvellous, Willy
you can stay here and wait for your mum.
Mrs Johnson. Mr. Johnson, do come in.
would you like a sweetie
he's a good lad, Willy.
he could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
my boys made those. Good, aren't they.
please, make yourself comfortable.
I was told not not to sit too close.
when speaking with a prince, one waits for the prince to choose the topic.
waiting for me to... commence a conversation one can wait a rather long wait.
do you know any jokes?
timing isn't my strong suit.
cuppa tea?
no thank you.
I think I'll have one.
aren't you going to start treating me Dr Logue?
only if you're interested in being treated.
please, call me Lionel.
I... I prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel. What'll I call you?
your Royal Highness, then Sir after that.
a bit formal for here. I prefer names
prince Albert Frederick Arthur George?
how about Bertie?
only my family uses that.
perfect. In here, it's better if we're equals.
if we were equal. I wouldn't be here.
I'd be at home with my wife and no-one would give a damn.
please don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
my physicians say it relaxes the throat.
they're idiots.
they've all been knighted.
makes it official then.
my "castle," my rules.
thank you
what was your earliest memory?
what an earth do you mean?
your first recollection.
I'm not here to discuss personal matters.
Why're you here then?
because I bloody well stammer!
you have a bit of a temper.
one of my many faults.
when did the defect start?
I've always been this way!
I doubt that.
don't. tell me! It's my stammer!
it's my field. I assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
when did it start?
four or five.
that's typical.
so I've been told.
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that. Do you hesitate when you think?
don't be ridiculous.
how about when you talk to yourself?
everyone natters occasionally, Bertie.
stop calling me that!
I'm not going to call you anything else.
then we shan't speak!
are you charging for this, Doctor?
a fortune.
I'll just save that brew
so, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
of course not!
that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
what do you think was the cause?
I don't know! I... don't care!
I stammer. And no one can fix it.
I'll bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
and if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.
and if I win?
you don't have to answer them.
one usually... wagers money.
a bob each to keep it sweet? Let's see your shilling.
I don't... carry money.
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you. And you can pay me back next time.
if there is a next time.
I haven't agreed to take you on yet
so please stand, and take a look at that, from there
I can't read this.
then you owe me a shilling for not trying.
"To. to.be or not to be,
that... is." damn
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice
and then play it back to you on the same machine.
this is brilliant. It's the latest thing from America: a Silvertone.
pop these on?
there's a bob in this, mate. You can go home rich!
you're playing music. -- I know.
how can I hear what I'm saying?!
surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
you're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
hopeless. Hopeless!
you were sublime.
would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
let me play it back to you -- No.
alright then, I'll get to ask you the questions.
thank you Doctor, I don't... feel this is for me.
thank you for your time. Bye
sir?
the recording is free.
please keep it as a souvenir?
no
ah well.
bugger
for the present the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility within our borders, to regain prosperity in this time of depression without self-seeking and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years has disheartened or overborne.
God bless you.
and off air
easy when you know how.
sir?
have a go yourself.
congratulations, Sir.
Ah, Mr Wood. Splendid fellow.
chap taught me everything I know:
let the microphone do the work.
sir.
thank you.
sit up, straight back, face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare its quare in the eye, as you would any decent Englishman.
show who's in command.
Papa I don't...think I read this
this devilish device will change everything if you won't.
in the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
now we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
this family has been reduced to those lowest beast of all creatures...we've become...actors!
we're not a family, we're a firm.
yet any moment some of us may be out of work.
your darling brother... and future king
the only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!
he's broken off with Lady Furness.
and taken up a Mrs Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!
I told him straight no divorced person can ever be received at court.
he said she made him sublimely happy.
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word" this is what he said "I give you my word, we've never had immoral relations,"
stared square into his father's eyes...
and lied.
when I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months.
who'll pick up the pieces?
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe,
Marshall Stalin the other half?
who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss? You?
with your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
have a go yourself.

lying bastard.
you're playing music. -- I know.
how can I hear what I'm saying?!
surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
you're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
"to be, or not to be, - that is the question":
..."Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
and by opposing end them.
to die, to sleep no more
and by a sleep to say we end
the heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to? 'tis a consummation..."
hopeless! Hopeless!
strictly business. No. personal nonsense.
I thought I'd made that very clear in our interview.
got the shilling you owe me?
no I haven't
didn't think so.
besides, you...tricked me!
physical exercises and tricks are important
but what you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
is that that's sufficient? Ah, no.
as far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
maybe just deal with that.
I.I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue...
Lionel.
are you... willing to do your part?
alright. You want mechanics?
we need to relax your jaw muscles and strengthen your tongue.
by repeating tongue twisters for example.
"I am a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
because I am a thistle sifter."
fine.
you do have a flabby tummy,
we'll need to spend some time strength in your diaphragm.
simple mechanics.
that is all we ask.
and that's about a shilling's worth.
forget about the blessed shilling!
perhaps, upon occasion,
you might be request to assistance...
in coping with...some minor event.
will that be agreeable?
of course.
that will be the full extent of your services.
shall I see you next week?
I shall see you every day.

isn't that what public speaking is all about?
my wife and I are glad to visit this important...

sandringham Estate 1936
Hello, Bertie. -- Hello David -- I see you've been coming out -- Not at all
been waiting long? For Christ, bloody freezing
Where've you been?
been busy.
so was I. Elizabeth has pneumonia.
I'm sorry. She'll recover.
father won't.
I'll drive.
old bugger's doing this on purpose.
dying?
departing prematurely to complicate matters with Wallis.
Oh for heaven's sake, David.
you know how long he's been ill.
wallis explained. She's terribly clever about these things.
... Whereas by letters patent under the Great Seal, bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh June 1912
his Majesty King George V did constitute, order and declare that there should be a guardian, - what's going on here? - Custos Regni, in the form of Councilors of State.
I cannot follow you. I'm confused and I don't understand - ... What you're taking about - It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.
would you do that? - So we may act on your behalf.
not clearly I'm afraid...I'm still confused...
but Approved. Thank you.
let me help you sir -- Alright -- Thank you sir -- Thank you
feeling a little better Sir?
no. I'm not feeling any better. I feel dreadful.
been ice-skating?
no, George.
Yes, he's alright. Of course.
I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do far too often lately.
David, the dinner - I'm on with Wallis
it's Bertie.
no, it's not important. No. I don't want to
no, telephone me later? Right, bye
wallis misses me terribly.
mama says you're late for dinner.
she forgets Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast!
how is the king? I hope he is not in pain.
no, no, His Majesty is quieter now.
thank you
David, if your father were here, tardiness would not be tolerated.
none of this unpleasantness would be tolerated
you know sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father
both in outlook and temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried in your interest to present it in a most favorable light.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I'm fear our vigil will not be of long duration.
please continue, thank you just commend our brother George to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
long live the King.
I hope I will make good as he has made good.
what on earth was that?
poor Wallis. Now I'm trapped!
and in these last 25 crowded troubled glorious years
if there's one thing that King George has taught
it is the art of the leader with also a brother to his followers
as long as he lives he was the guiding star of a great nation
dad?
time for a Shake, dad?
you sure? -- Go on
put your thinking caps on.
bet its the Scottish Play.
no, I bet it's Othello. It's always Othello.
"art thou afeard? Be not afeard"
Caliban! -- Oh! For heaven's sake. that was a lucky guess!
don't listen to egghead. Go on, Dad.
"the isle is full of noises,
sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
sometimes a thousand twanging instruments
will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices,
that, if then I had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again:"
alright, clever clogs, what comes next?
"and then, in dreaming, Me thought the clouds" - the clouds me thought "The clouds me thought would open,
and show riches Ready to drop upon me; that..."
...when I waked, I cried to dream again."
it's such a sad thought.
my next patient must be a bit early. You better go lads, I'm sorry.
won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie, they told me not to expect you.
sorry about your father.
I don't wish to intrude.
no. Not at all, please come in
I've been practising. One hour a day.
in spite of everything.
what's going on there?
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.
do you feel like working today?
a Curtis bi-plane.
I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue, I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
still makes me sad.
I can imagine so.
what did you father do? -- He was brewer.
Oh. -- At least there was free beer.
here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact, my father's ...last words were:
"Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together."
he couldn't say that to my face.
my brother.
what about him?
try singing it. -- I'm sorry?
what songs do you know?
songs? -- "Swanee River"
I love that song. -- Happens to be my favorite.
sing me the chorus. -- No. Certainly not.
I always wanted to build models.
father... wouldn't allow it. He collected stamps.
we had to collect stamps.
you can finish that off. If you sing.
"my brother David, doo-dah" -- I'm not going to sit here wobbling
you can with me.
because... you're peculiar.
I take that as a compliment.
rules are rules
I'm not...crooning "Swanee River!"
try "Camptown Races" then.
"my brother D, he said to me, doodah doo-dah..."
continuous sound will give you flow. -- No
does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?
tell you the truth, It was a relief...
knowing I wouldn't be King.
but unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
and your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
"you're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor."
"Lionel," You didn't stammer.
of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!
well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
your boy wouldn't mind? -- No, not at all
david and I were very close.
young bucks... You know.
did you chase the same girls?
david was always very helpful in arranging introductions.
we shared... the expert ministrations of "Paulette" in Paris.
not at the same time of course.
did David ever tease you?
Oh yes they all did.
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie."
father encouraged it.
"get it out, boy!"
said it would make me stop.
said..."I was afraid of my father, and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me."
are you naturally right handed?
left. I was... punished. Now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
anything other corrections?
knock knees.
metal... splints were made...worn...day and night
that must have been painful.
bloody agony. Straight legs now.
who were you closest to in your family?
nannies. Not my first nanny.
she loved David...hated me.
when I was presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she'd...she pinch me so I'd cry, and be...handed back to her immediately, then she wouldn't...
sing it -- Then she wouldn't feed me, far far away."
took my parents three years to notice.
as you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems. Still.
what about your brother Johnnie?
were you close to him?
Johnnie, Sweet boy.
Epilepsy...and...he was 'different'.
he died at 13, hidden from view.
I've been told it's not catching.
do you want a top-up? -- Please.
you know, Lionel, -- you're the first ordinary Englishman... -- Australian.
...I've ever really spoken to.
when I'm driven through the streets and see, you know, the Common Man staring at me,
I'm struck by how little I know of his life, and how little he knows of mine.
thank you -- What're friends for.
I wouldn't know.
balmoral Castle, Scotland "I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thick sieves.
I sifted seven...
isn't that enough darling? No? -- I have to keep doing this
this is your fault.
I sifted seven -- Oh no
one hundred year old spruces removed to improve the view!
who do you think she is?
Nonetheless...we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.
you know she calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook"?
you're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
you seldom cook.
I sifted seven. -- Shut up!!
I sifted...
3, 2,1 and booze -- Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
how lovely to see you both.
welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
your Majesty - All right - Sorry we're late
very nice to see you, Mrs Simpson
very nice
hello David.
making... some changes to the garden I see.
I am. I am not quite finished yet.
don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.
on the contrary, your Royal Highness.
etiquette decrees royalty should be greeted by the official host:
in this case: the King. Not a commoner.
thank you. -- What is her hold on him?
I've no idea.
apparently she has certain...skills, which she learnt in an establishment in Shanghai.
david - just be a sec, darling
excuse me.
David, I've been trying to see you...
I've been terribly busy.
doing what? -- Kinging.
Really?
Kinging is a precarious business these days!
where is the Tsar of Russia?
where is Cousin Wilhelm?
you're being dreary.
is Kinging laying off eighty staff and buying yet more pearls for Wallis while there are people marching across Europe singing "The Red Flag"?
stop your worrying. Herr Hitler will sort that lot out.
who'll sort out Herr Hitler?
Where's the bloody 23"?
and you've put that woman into our mother's suite?
mother's not still in the bed, is she?
that's not funny.
here it is, Wally likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you show up for duty in the morning!
wallis is not just some woman I am carrying on with.
we intend to marry
excuse me?
she's filing a petition for divorce.
good God.
can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
I'm not having her as my mistress.
the Church does not recognise divorce and you are the... head of the church.
haven't I any rights? -- Many privileges...
not the same thing. Your beloved Common Man may marry for love,
why not me?
if you were the Common Man, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?!
sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.
sounds like you haven't.
is that what this is all about? Bashing up?
hence the elocution lessons?
that's the scoop around town.
I'm trying to...to...
yearning for a larger audience are we,
B-b-b-Bertie?
D-don't...
what's that? I'm sorry.
young brother trying to push older brother off throne...
Po...Positively medieval.
wallis - where have you been all this time?
I've been talking to.
never mind.
it's very complicated little king you're - I tried to be
all that work, down the drain.
my own brother... I couldn't say a single word to him in reply!
why do you stammer more with David than you do with me?
because you're bloody well paid to listen!
bertie I'm not a geisha girl.
stop trying to be so bloody clever!
what is it about David that stops you speaking?
what is it about you that bloody well make you want to go on about it the whole bloody time?
vulgar but fluent. You don't stammer when you swear.
bugger off!
is that the best you can do?
well bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
a public school prig can do better than that.
shit. Shit, shit, shit!
defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?
because I'm angry!
Ah. Know the f-word?
fornication?
Oh Bertie.
fuck. Fuck, fucking, fuck!
bugger, bugger, bugger!
fuck Fuck ass -- Balls Balls Fuckity -- Yes! You see! Not a hesitation!
Willy, shit and Fuck, and tits
dad? What's going on?
sorry. Just finish your homework.
well that's a side of you we don't get to see all that often.
no. No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.
let's get some air.
no Logue, I don't think that's a good idea.
what's the matter? Why are you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
my brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice
she's asking for a divorce
and he is determined to marry her.
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.
that's not right. Queen Wallis of Baltimore?
unthinkable.
can he do it? - -Absolutely not.
but he's going to anyway. All hell's broken loose.
can't they carry on privately?
if only they would.
where does that leave you?
I know my place!
I'll... do anything within my power to keep my brother on the throne.
is it that serious? Your place may be on the throne.
I am not an alternative to my brother.
you can outshine David... -- Don't take liberties!
that's bordering on treason.
I'm just saying you could be King. You could do it!
that is treason!
I'm trying to get you to realize you need not be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this!
What're you afraid of?
your poisonous words!
why'd you come to me?
you're not middle-class banker who want elocution lessons...
so you can chit-chat at posh tea parties? -- Don't attempt to instruct me on my duties!
I'm the son of a... King...
the brother of a King...
you're the disappointing son of a brewer!
a jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!
you're nobody. These sessions are over!
through here sir.
garden Entrance. Prime Minister's Office 10 Dawning Street
it's not just because she's an American.
that the least of it, it's because she is soon to be a twice divorced American, and the King, as the head of Church of England...
can not marry a divorced woman.
and sir, I apologize for the nature of this, but...
according to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possess exclusive rights to Mrs. Simpson's favours and affections, sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr Guy Trundle.
in addition, it is also rumored that Hitler's ambassador,
count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day...
should His Majesty continue to ignore the advice of His Government,
he must abdicate. Otherwise His Government has no choice but to resign.
prime Minister, you'd leave the country without a... government?
does the King do what he wants, or does he do what his people expect him to do?
as crowds on Donning Street watch Ministers come and go
there raised an age-old problem.
can the King separate his personal life from his public duty?
what's the matter, love? -- I'm just having trouble with a patient -- It isn't like you. Why - He's scared.
frightened of his own shadow.
isn't that why they come to you?
this fellow could really be somebody great. He's fighting me.
perhaps he doesn't want to be great.
perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
apologize. Deep of good.
I'm very sorry, Mr Logue, the Duke is busy
I'm happy to wait. Or I could come back later.
as I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
thank you
thank you
parliament will not support the marriage.
but there were other reasons for concern.
he was careless with state papers.
he lacked commitment and resolve.
there were those that worried where he would stand when war with Germany.
we're not coming to that?
indeed we are, Sir. Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
war with Germany will come, and we will need a King we can all stand behind united.
I fear my brother is of sound mind at this time
have you thought what you will call yourself?
I...I...
certainly not Albert, Sir. Too Germanic.
what about George? After your father?
george the sixth.
it has rather a nice continuity to it, don't you think.
David! Thank God. You look exhausted!
how are you bearing up?
Bertie. The decision's been made. I'm... I'm going
I cannot accept that. You are in no condition to make that decision.
I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
my mind's made up. I'm... sorry.
that's a terrible thing to hear.
nobody wants that. I least of all.
at long last I am able to say a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything
but until now, it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
a few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.
now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
this I do with all my heart.
you all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne.
but you must believe me when I tell you
that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love...
and I want you to know, this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country...
...and with his fine qualities will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the empire.
accession Council. St James's Palace. 12th Dec, 1936
I meet you today in...in circumstances which are .
I'm sure you'll love it.
thank you darling, saddles, Margret
yes mom.
good boy.
mama, here's the Wilson saddle -- Thank you
don't worry, we'll get you food in a minute
mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?
of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.
curtsey.
your Majesty.
how was it?
I'm trying to... familiarise myself with what a state paper looks like.
a despatch from Mr Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
the Christmas broadcast -
I think that might be a mistake.
don't worry about that
plans for the Coronation. I think that's an even bigger mistake.
I'm not a King.
I'm a naval officer. That's all I know
I'm not a King, not a king.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -- No. Dear.
dear, dear man...
I'm sorry.
you know, I refused your first two marriage proposals,
not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the idea of a royal life
could bear the idea of a life of tours and public duties, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
then I thought...he stammers so beautifully...
they'll leave us alone.
waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
this is home. Myrtle's at bridge.
I've made sure the boys are out.
it's lovely. Absolutely lovely.
may I sit down? -- Yes, of course
would you like some tea, Ma'am?
Yes. I'll help myself.
off you go now. Or must I knock your heads together?
here's your shilling
I...understand what you were trying to say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way. I'm sorry.
so here I am.
is the nation ready for two minutes of radio silence?
every stammer always fears they will fall back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
if I fail in my duty... David could come back.
I've seen the placards "God Save Our... King!"
they don't mean me.
every other monarch in history succeeded someone who was dead,
or about to be.
my predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
bloody mess! I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.
like your Dad used to do? --Precisely.
he's not here anymore.
yes he is. He's on that shilling I gave you.
easy enough to give away.
you don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
or your brother.
you don't need to be afraid of things you were afraid of when you were five.
you're very much your own man, Bertie.
right
your face is next, mate.
Lionel? Dear?
myrtle!
is this your wife? -- Yes.
Bertie, come here - Are you alright, Logue? -- Yes.
shall we go through?
trust me it's important.
what is it?
your... your...
it's "Your Majesty," the first time.
after that, "Ma'am," as in ham, not Ma'lm as in palm.
I haven't told her about us. Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
your Majesty, you may call me Mrs Logue, Ma'am.
very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue - Logue, we can't stay here all day. --Yes we can.
Logue. -- Look, I need to wait for the opportune moment.
you're being a coward! -- You're damn right.
get out there, man!
Oh! Hello, Myrtle darling! You're early.
I believe you two have met!
I don't believe you know...King George VI?
it's very nice to meet you.
will their Majesties be staying to dinner?
we would love to, such a treat, but alas a previous engagement. What a pity.
archbishop.
welcome your Majesty.
what a glorious transformation, Sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue our preparations.
now, allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
we begin, of course at the West Door, then into the nave.
I see all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box.
I'm afraid I've also had to permit the newsreel cameras.
the product of which I shall personally edit.
without momentary hesitation.
this is Dr. Logue from Harley Street.
he's... my speech therapist.
your Grace
had I known Your Majesty was seeking assistance
I would've made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue will be attending the Coronation.
well of course I shall speak to the Dean, but it will be extremely difficult.
I should like... the Doctor to be seated in the... King's Box.
but members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.
that why it's suitable.
and now, if you don't mind, your grace we need the premises.
my dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
the Church must prepare his Majesty.
my preparations are equally important.
with complete privacy. If you don't mind.
those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I will place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal...this evening.
your Majesty.
look, he again. Come on.
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
everything alright? Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, "Doctor" Logue.
call me Lionel
true, you never...
called yourself 'Doctor'. I did that for you.
no training, no diploma, no. qualifications.
just a great deal of nerve.
the star chamber inquisition, is it?
you asked for trust and. total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley,
I was there.
my son Laurie said "Do you think you could help that poor man?"
what, as a failed actor!?
it's true, I'm not a doctor, and yes I acted a bit,
I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.
when the Great War came, our soldiers were pouring back from the front, shell-shocked and unable to speak and somebody said,"Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.
do you think you could possibly help these poor buggers."
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
those poor young blokes had cried out in fear, and no-one was listening to them.
my job was to give them faith in their voice and let them know that a friend was listening.
that must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
you give a very noble account of yourself.
make inquiries. It's all true.
inquiries have been made!
you have no idea who I have breathing down my neck.
I vouched for you and you have no...credentials.
but lots of success! I can't show you a certificate there was no training then.
all I know I know by experience, and that war was some experience.
may plaque says, 'L Logue, Speech Defects."
no Dr. No letters after my name.
lock me in the Tower.
I would if I could!
on what charge?
fraud! With war looming, you've saddle this nation with a voiceless King.
you destroyed the happiness of my family...
all for the sake of ensnaring a star patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist!
it'll be like mad ...King George the Third, there'll be...Mad King George the Stammerer, who let his people down so badly in their hour of need!
What're you doing? Get up! You can't sit there! Get up
why not? It's a chair.
no, it's not, that is... Saint Edward's Chair
people have carved their name into it!
that chair is the seat on which every King and Queen
it's held in place by a large rock!
that is the Stone of Scone, - you are trivialising everything -- I don't care.
I don't care how many Royal arses have sat in this chair
listen to me... ! listen to me... ! listen to me... !
listen to you?! By what right?
my divine right, if you must! I'm your King!!!
Noooo you're not! Told me so yourself.
said you didn't want it. Why should I waste my time listening to you?
because I have a right to be heard!
I HAVE A VOICE!!!
yes you do.
you have such perseverance, Bertie, you're the bravest man I know.
you'll make a bloody good king.
what on earth's going on, Sir?
it's quite all right, Archbishop.
mr Logue, you should know that I have found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials. Hence, your services will no longer be required.
I'm sorry?
your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
you didn't consult, but you've just been advised.
now I advise you: in this personal matter I will make my own decision.
my concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that Archbishop but it's my head!
your humble servant.
thank you Bertie.
shall we rehearse?
come on, up on your perch
now when you and Elizabeth enter through West door, you'll be greeted with the hymn "I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me."
you won't actually be that glad, because they sing it for a great long time.
then your friend the Archbishop will ponce up the stairs towards you and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The Oath"?
"I am willing."
course you are! I'll see what it sounds like from the cheap seats so even your old nanny can hear.
"will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland,
canada, Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs?"
I solemnly promise so do so.
Louder! I can't hear you up the back.
"I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!"
very good! "Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?
"I will." "I WILL!"
then a long bit about upholding the faith goes on, rubbish, rubbish
to which you finally say...
"these things which I have here before promised,
I will perform and keep. So help me God."
that's all you have to say. Four short responses, kiss the book and sign the oath.
there you are: you're King.
easy.
you nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!
someone had removed the thread marking the front of the Crown, Sir.
try not lose the thread, Archbishop.
archbishop, your missing Papa.
very good, very good. Archbishop.
well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
you can switch that machine off now.
no, wait, keeping going.
do have a seat, Archbishop.
Papa, what's he saying?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
sir, I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
it's a matter of principal. I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the World so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler, but the world might be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive War.
Churchill was right all along. This was always Hitler's intention.
I am only sorry to leave you in this great time of crisis.
I am very much afraid Sir,
that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room of 10 Downing Street.
this morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.
at last. Sir, here's your speech. You are on air at six.
I've timed it to just under nine minutes.
the wording is fully approved.
the Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast which will go out live across to the Nation, the Empire and to our Armed Forces.
get Logue here immediately.
there are the barrage balloons.
Yes, they got them up there quickly.
should we pull over and find shelter?
no, go straight there. We'll be alright.
yes sir? -- Lionel Logue, Major Harding is expecting me
this is my son Laurie -- Thank you Laurie --Good luck dad -- The King's speech, we have about 40 minutes to the broadcast -- Thank you
thank you very much. Thank you "There may be dark days ahead, and...
try again.
"there may be dark days ahead, andw-... "
turn the hesitations into pauses, and say to yourself, "God save the King."
I say that continually, but apparently no one's listening.
long pauses are good: they add solemnity to great occasions.
then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
if I am a King...where is my power?
can I form a Government,
can I levy a tax or declare a war?
No! Yet I am the seat of all authority.
Why? Because the Nation believes when I speak,
I speak for them. Yet I cannot speak!
let's take it all again from the top. In this grave hour...
"in this grave hour fuck fuck fuck perhaps the most fateful in our history bugger shit shit
I send to every household of my p-p
the 'P" is always difficult even when I'm singing
bounce onto it 'a-peoples'
"a-peoples both at home and overseas,..."
beautiful.
..." This message, doo-dah, doodah...
spoken with the same depth of feeling...doodah for each one of you as if I able to fuck shit bugger cross your threshold and speak to you m-my - ..."
in your head, now: "I have a right to be bloody well heard!"
bloody well heard, bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
now Waltz. Move! Get continuous movement.
"for the second time in the lives of most of us we are at wa - ..."
pause. "we are..." Take a pause.
I can't do this.
Bertie, you can do it. Have a look at the last paragraph.
Bertie...it's time.
archbishop -- Your Majesty
a great moment, sir.
prime Minister. -- Your Majesty
nice to see you again, so soon.
good of you to be here, I'm sure you've had rather a busy day.
let's hope we have no more interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.
or the wretched dogs.
Congratulations. First Lord of the Admiralty. -- Your Majesty.
the long walk.
good luck, Sir. I too dread this...apparatus.
had a speech impediment myself, you know.
I didn't. -- Family secret. Tongue-tied.
an operation was considered too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
thank you, Mr Churchill. - Sir.
darling
how long, Logue?
just under three minutes, Sir.
mr Wood.
good luck, Your Majesty.
mr Wood.
you've redecorated, Logue. -- I made it cozy.
some fresh air.
there you are, darling.
I am thistle sifter, I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.
I am thistle sifter, I have a sieve of sifted thistles
Bertie, darling, make sure it's not switched on!
remember the red light will blink four times and then I've asked them to turn it off, because we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
one minute, sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
40 second, sir
Logue, however this turns out,
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.
knighthood?
twenty seconds.
forget everything else and just say it to me.
say it to me, as a friend.
in this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history,
I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself.
for the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war.
over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies.
but it has been in vain. We have been forced into a conflict.
for we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.
such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right.
for the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
it is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm, and united in this time of trial.
the task will be hard. There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
but we can only do the right as we see the right and reverently commit our cause to God.
if one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help, we shall prevail.
that was very good, Bertie.
you still stammered on the "w."
had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.
congratulations, your Majesty. A true broadcaster.
thank you, Mr Wood.
congratulations, your Majesty.
congratulations, your Majesty.
thank you.
ready? -- Good
perfect
your first war time speech. Congratulation.
expect I shall have to do a great deal more.
thank you, Logue.
well done. My friend.
thank you... Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
thank you...
...Lionel.
Onwards?
congratulations, Sir
couldn't have said it better myself, Sir
your Majesty, I'm speechless.
congratulations, Sir
gentlemen.
so how was Papa, Elizabeth?
halting at first, but you got much better Papa.
bless you.
and how about you, Margret?
you were just splendid, Papa.
of course I was.
you're all ready?
come on girls.
king George VI made Lionel Logue a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1944.
this high honour from a grateful King made Lionel part of the only order of chivalry that specifically rewards acts of personal service to the Monarch.
Lionel was with the King for every wartime speech.
through his broadcasts, George VI became a symbol of national resistance.
Lionel and Bertie remained friends for the rest of their lives.
don't be late. - Yes, sir, sergeant sir.
sorry I'm late. They keep changing scheduling in here.
they do that. I'll be quick.
I need you on sentry duty for the next 3 days.
I'm about to raise a little hell out there, And I need you to tell me when division responds.
got it. What are you gonna do?
something I should have done a long time ago.
be ready.
sorry. - No worries.
you're pretty good at that. - Thanks.
you look just like your dad.
you knew my dad?
thank you.
Lisa, don't move.
Oh, God. Please don't hurt us.
that would be a mistake.
since when do you own a gun?
since you killed my husband.
relax your hand.
if I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.
your husband, Victor, he was a good man.
what did he tell you about his work with homeland security?
his work was classified. He never told any...
he was trying to take down the red circle triad.
they deal in slave labor for some of the major fashion houses.
6 years after his death, their business is booming.
that's why I'm here, Lisa.
I'm going after the triad.
but you work for the triad. - No...
but I believe they hired the people I used to work for.
they used me to get close to your to gain your trust.
well, that worked, didn't it?
I didn't have a choice 6 years ago. I do now.
I'm going to bring down the bosses who called the hit,
but I can't do that until I know you're safe.
you're going to take that car.
you and Sophie. You're gonna drive it upstate to a Lake house.
you're gonna stay there till you get my call.
no. No way.
listen to me.
once I go after these people, They are going to come looking for you.
the only way to be safe is to take that car
and drive to the address on the navigation system.
Lisa, I'm not asking for your forgiveness.
I'm asking you to protect your daughter.
well, that's what we agreed.
you know, I don't care.
talk them down, or I'm pulling the line.
sandy, call wholesale and make sure they get that price.
ms. Wiles . Roxanne Barnes. I'm the buyer from midland.
Midland. I thought you were coming next week.
I know. Our schedule got shifted.
I hope it's OK.
and I just want to get it out of the way...
personally, I'm a huge fan.
Ah, so, you're here to put all my clothes
beside lawn mowers and shotguns all across America.
the world, actually.
we have 3, 600 stores. Beautiful.
the quality's amazing, considering where it's made.
excuse me?
Oh, Ms. Wiles, midland has no problem keeping costs down.
your secret is safe with us.
I'm sorry. I'm not following you.
Oh, well, I've got samples. Maybe this will help.
here we are.
what is this?
it's just 63 people who were going to be your employees.
port authority found them last week, suffocated.
a tragic accident of human smuggling.
your clothes are all made in sweatshops.
the red circle triad?
they provide your slave labor, don't they?
who are you?
somebody who would never buy your crap.
tell me where the sweatshop is.
you've had your lawyers running interference on this,
so I know you know where it is.
tell me. - Get out of my... ohh!
you scream, and I will snap your neck.
not so glamorous, is it, feeling powerless?
now be a good slave
and give me the address.
good morning.
as you are called upon for field work, you can count on one thing...
you'll be asked to perform highly involved tasks in exigent situations.
what we like to call grace under fire.
you've all been schooled in basic ied interdiction,
but can you do it in a pinch?
there's a bomb under this car.
you have 30 seconds.
who wants to go first?
Alex, you're up.
and begin.
I can't move.
get me out of here.
stop!
get me out of here!
it's OK. It's OK.
it's all right. It's all right.
I got this. - It doesn't look like it.
what, are you checking up on me?
not at all.
you're wanted in operations.
she ided herself as Roxanne Barnes.
that's the name of an actual fashion buyer
apparently Nikita broke this lady's wrist.
she's pissed off about something.
so what does Tonya wiles do?
you mean besides providestylish ready-to-wear fashion
here's a flag.
she was questioned last year by customs
about a forced labor scam run by the red circle triad.
everybody lawyered up. It went nowhere.
she's going back to her first mission.
her first kill.
got a bead on her yet?
well, she took on Tonya in Manhattan.
uh, 27th street fashion district.
am I missing something here?
why would Nikita follow up on a kill she made 6 years ago?
the case is way closed.
maybe she's re-opening it.
Nikita, have a moment?
I've been down here a year.
I got nothing but moments.
good,'cause I'm on a schedule.
what have you got behind your back?
nothing.
I may just have to fight you for it.
you scared?
terrified. - Well, OK.
one arm behind my back?
it's your funeral.
Ohh! Michael.
want to even the odds?
that was pretty good.
that's the big secret?
a key card?
it's your ticket to the outside world.
you've been activated for your first op.
I get to leave?
no, the activation's provisional.
you have to come right back here after you complete the assignment.
like a learner's permit.
but you have to see Amanda first.
such a tease.
don't attack so hard.
I thought that was the point.
Kobudo's about defense.
if all you do is thrash at your opponent, you're gonna get nailed.
you still haven't let go of what happened this morning, huh?
Hey, where you going?
I gotta go to the computer lab.
right now?
2 out of 3 after lunch?
Yeah, I'm there.
Amanda would like to see you.
Yeah, I gotta go... - now.
what do I always say about preparation?
it's the key to success.
your first provisional assignment.
it's a big step.
please don't say,"you're a woman now.
well, you have grown up over the last year.
I take some measure of pride in that.
the truth is, you've earned our trust.
what is my first assignment?
just remember.
trust is not something you win.
it's something you build.
and that's your assignment...
to build a trust so powerful that it would make someone welcome you into their family.
family?
congratulations, Nikita.
your references are stellar.
I can see why my wife wants to hire you.
Oh, it's not just that, Victor. It's Sophie.
she likes Nikita. I can tell already.
honey. - Oh, sorry.
no one said this thing was going to take over my life.
sentry 1 to sentry 2, front yard is clear.
what is it you do, Mr. Han?
I work for this new agency called homeland security.
bush just created a new, uh, cabinet post for it.
you work for the government?
Yes.
and I've got a few enemies already.
stop asking him questions.
you're supposed to be gaining their confidence, not blowing it.
if you feel uncomfortable, Nikita...
no, I just...
I didn't know this is what I'd signed up for.
complete the mission.
OK, then...
it's fine.
I was an Au pair for an expat family in Shanghai.
they had all kinds of armed guards around.
then we're good.
you'll be safe, and so will my little girl,
as long as we keep her away from peanut products.
no, that's your thing, honey.
we don't know that princess is gonna have
the same little peanut allergy as daddy, do we?
welcome to the family, Nikita.
I gotta go. Protect the homeland or whatever.
I was hoping not to use that.
this is pointless.
I had a freak-out. So what?
you had a panic attack, Alex.
an involuntary reaction. To what, I'm not sure.
let's talk about it.
I'm fine.
I've seen this a thousand times, Alex,
especially with new arrivals.
we take you in, turn you into something new,
even better than you were before.
but there's always something you can't let go of.
what triggered the attack, Alex?
what was going through your mind?
you really want to know?
it's this place.
it reminds me of how I used to live.
how I was forced to live.
when you were held by the Russians.
why don't we just say it?
when I was a sex slave.
they locked me in a hole and woke me when it was time to perform.
at least they had the decency to keep me high the whole time.
you make a good point.
and you're obviously suffering from post-traumatic stress.
here. Let me help you.
there. Happy? I feel better already.
we still need to work on your manners.
sorry to ruin the whole day-spa vibe you've got going in here,
but I don't need your help.
Alex, you don't have a choice.
OK, so what is this place?
headquarters for the red circle triad in New York.
nothing much going on right now, But at night it turns into a pretty happenin' spot.
lady gaga was there last Friday.
that's great. Where's the boss?
name is Chen lo, according to the Intel group.
he runs the business from a back room in the northeast corner.
give me a second.
OK, I got eyes inside.
see for yourself. The guy in the suit is Chen lo.
you catching that?
Yeah, congratulations.
looks like Nikita hit the sweatshop,
but she let the sweatshop boss get away.
let him get away?
that's not in her DNA.
exactly. Run a scan.
see if you can snag any wideband Rf transmissions.
got a signal coming from that room.
she put a tracker on the sweatshop boss so she could follow him to Chen lo.
crafty.
she have to be nearby to track it?
no. Military-grade transmitter.
she could be anywhere in the city.
man, Nikki's all hard-core about this, huh?
kinda crazy how she's going back to her greatest hits,
no pun.
just have the team on standby, all right?
Nikita, I'm gonna head out to the farmer's market.
I want to get some stuff for dinner. You good?
Yes, we are, mama. Yes, we are!
we're very, very good.
I thought so. I'll be back.
Bye-bye.
we'll be here.
Bye-bye, mama.
take the baby for a walk.
of course, my husband can't come.
just had to work on Sunday.
Hey, I'm trying to protect an entire nation.
it's gorgeous out.
I think I'm gonna take her for a walk.
good idea.
don't want the hubby home alone with the young nanny.
Oh, all right.
you just may have to pay for that.
just make sure to take one of the guys with you, Nikita.
that's good. Keep walking.
give me the baby.
what do you want with a baby?
give me the baby now.
I'm not giving her to you. Or to him.
we're not going to hurt her, Nikita.
this is roan.
standby for abort and clean.
do not get ahead of yourself, do you hear me?
control your asset, or I will.
Sophie will be returned to her mother.
we have orders to not hurt them.
so Victor Han is the target.
why does he have to die?
look, if you don't do this, division will call a clean.
that means they clean everything and everyone, including you and that child.
and there's not a damned thing I can do about it.
you got that?
we don't have a choice. Give me the child.
put the device in the crib, arm it and leave.
Hey, hey, hey.
she asleep?
out like a light.
I'm gonna go enjoy some more of the day.
go for it.
Nikita. Thank you.
I don't know what we'd do without you.
clear.
Alex, where are you?
do you like it?
it's part of our spring collection.
get this off of me.
it's not up to me. It's up to you.
the jacket has an electronic lock which is synchronized
with the heart rate monitor around your chest.
if you can bring your pulse down to 51 beats per minute,
the lock will release.
you panicked during a simple exercise, Alex.
division won't tolerate that kind of physical liability in a recruit.
you have to prove you can pass this test,
or it may be your last.
I got nothing.
Birkhoff, anything?
no, but I like this channel.
keep your eyes on the models.
you know how she likes to dress up.
I should have known.
when they told me some crazy bitch burned down my factory, I wasn't sure.
all these years, I thought I killed you.
you were triad.
well, like they say...
no, you couldn't have pulled this off on your own.
and homeland wouldn't have stood for it.
you made a deal with Percy.
that's why we faked your death.
he's gonna get an earful from me after today.
how could you?
you had a wife and a daughter.
the insurance took care of them, Nikita.
everyone came out a winner...
except you.
in a matter of seconds, you're going to be surrounded.
what do you think you're doing?
I hate chatting online.
let's do this face-to-face.
it's bulletproof.
so you gonna take down the triads now? Is that it?
it was just gonna be their man in New York.
then I found out Victor Han is their boss.
what?
you don't know.
Victor Han is alive, Michael.
of course you don't know.
you never asked.
you probably don't even know why he was a targeted.
he had to be dirty.
Oh, he was.
he was a double Agent for the triads.
he got a big fat promotion thanks to Percy's bait-and-switch.
not for long.
I need a location on Victor Han in Hong Kong.
who've you been talking to?
no, let me guess.
What'd she say?
how could Percy do such a thing, Michael?
make a deal with a criminal?
you want to know how?
I assume you had your reasons.
and you knew never to ask.
I always loved that about you.
did the right thing, Michael.
the government came to me with a serious situation.
a triad double Agent had worked his way so high up into homeland security,
he was attending NSC briefings at the West wing.
now, maybe you don't recall,
but this was 2 years after 911.
homeland was brand new.
do you have any idea what would have happened if that information had gone public?
it would destroy their agency.
the government came to us with a problem, and we solved it.
making him into a martyr was my idea.
Yeah, but to keep him alive. Why?
wouldn't want any blowback from the triads.
of course, you didn't take any money from them, either.
you better get going.
I'll text you Han's address.
Nikita's probably on her way to Hong Kong as we speak.
madam, don't you think you should have declared these
before returning to Hong Kong?
hmm. Yes, I was.
I was going to. I'm sorry.
is this the part where you tie me up?
listen, I will pay the fine. It's fine. It's totally fine.
I just... I don't want to go back in that line out there
because it's a little long,
and isn't there a side door or something I could go through?
certainly. - There you go.
something wrong?
no, I just didn't know we had company.
51 beats per minute. Then you'll be free.
face the flame.
breathe in through the nose, exhale through the mouth.
without blowing it out.
tell me about your pain, Alex.
it's the only way to let it go.
maybe I like my pain.
there was a girl who used to say the same thing.
turned out to be one of our best.
but she didn't become great until she set herself free.
by confronting her deepest, deepest fears.
I was 13.
I was with my parents.
we were driving.
there was an accident, and we fell into the River.
we were sinking.
and there was so much...
water.
my papa lost control.
I tried to scream, but I couldn't.
my parents died in that car accident.
and you people put me under that car.
I'm proud of you, Alex.
you really do remind me of Nikita.
you flew all the way out here for me.
that is just simply stupid.
I just had to see you again.
I spoke with Percy.
it's funny.
he didn't want to get into it.
Percy's not really a talker.
that's OK, I worked it out.
so you went and grew a conscience, Nikita?
now you're a thorn in Percy's side 'cause you think you can, what?
make a difference in the world?
you in prison being man-raped.
that'd be different.
you're going to tell me who knows about this.
did you tell Lisa and Sophie?
Oh, you remember their names.
don't get sanctimonious.
you know all about living a lie, Nikita.
Victor Han was a name I created to infiltrate homeland.
as for the wife and kid,
they were just my cover.
they were your family.
I have a family, here.
a wife and two children, and I want to keep it that way.
I'm not really a talker, either.
that's OK.
my boys here got a few power tools to help bring you out of your Shell.
you think you're gonna break me?
nobody likes a crusader, Nikita.
I tried it for a few months. I got blown up.
I can't believe I ever thought you were cute.
I can't believe I never had my way with you.
you couldn't handle me.
not then, not now.
the nice thing about the slave business
is that I can handle anything I want.
honestly, I think we would clash.
sort of like lipstick and peanut oil.
Please...Please.
shut up before I change my mind.
Victor Han, a former high-ranking official
in the United States department of homeland security,
a man thought to be dead,
found on the steps of the police department, Bound and gagged.
apparently left there by an unknown crusader.
no, it's not going to be a problem.
it's going to be an opportunity.
for who? For you.
Yeah. No, no.
easy, easy.
look, we both agree Victor was sloppy.
but you... you could take over the operation, couldn't you?
no, you're right. No... no commission.
for the time being.
when they returned her to me...
the people you used to work for...
they threatened me.
told me not to talk.
who knew her own father was behind it?
he'll pay for what he did.
I decided I'm not going to tell her.
as far as I'm concerned, Victor died that day.
you said you didn't want forgiveness,
but you deserve it, Nikita.
at least from me.
thank you.
the people who made you do this, can you ever stop them?
it's going to take some time.
what else you got?
pulse never broke 60.
damn, girl. What'd Amanda do to you?
I don't know. We just, uh, talked.
guess it worked.
Yeah, well, wait till I get under there.
thanks for pulling me out the first time.
you would have worked it out eventually.
I mean it, Thom.
so, uh, didn't you say 2 out of 3 with the Bo staff?
I did, didn't I?
you really want to get your ass kicked by a girl?
girls get no mercy.
that's the first rule of kobudo.
yeah? What's the second?
so how'd you do it?
I'm not done.
what do you mean?
she's hiding something.
sorry I missed you earlier. Got caught up.
how'd it go on your end?
you're supposed to be in logistics.
just tell me, straight.
why did we have to kill an innocent man?
one that works for our own government?
we don't ask questions.
you'd follow him over a cliff, wouldn't you?
just like that.
Percy gave you a gift.
he gave you a second chance.
he can have it back.
you don't have a choice.
what about you, Michael?
do you have a choice?
grow up.
why are you so loyal to Percy?
Why?
because I owe him my life.
all prisoners...
all prisoners, report to level B, now.
the taking of a life...
is no minor matter. Nor do we do it lightly.
this man has killed, and he will be killed.
he will be taken down, his head will be shaved.
he will be given confession, if he wishes it.
and then, we will test the apparatus.
once, twice...
the third time, his soul will be in that new place.
and I leave it to you to conjecture where that new place will be.
I've no doubt but that your thoughts will be troubled.
keep them to yourselves. I want no demonstrations.
I want no comments.
take him down. - Move.
so long, guys. - So long, Bobby.
no talking.
What're you gonna do to him, take away his commissary, you son of a bitch?
keep it down, Jim. - Son of a bitch.
I can't believe it. Can you believe it, Neddy?
I can believe most anything. My problem is, I just don't care.
taking Bobby to bakery. - Sometimes it works that way.
that the guy's gonna die, and that's it?
what's your question?
that that's the end of it? That he goes in that room...
goes in that room, they light him up, and that's the end of it...
there's no eternal life for his soul, and the cruelty of the world?
is that the thing? Is that your problem this fine evening?
Yes.
why don't you talk to the chaplain? - I'm talking to you.
I'm busy. I've got my mind on higher things.
I feel bad, Ned. - Well, do your own time.
you two, put these on.
what is it?
just tell me what it is. - Shut up! Keep walking!
life's a hellhole, pally.
you two were talking?
answer me.
you two were talking during my speech.
I... - You swine.
you little swine. Hold him down.
you want order?
I'll give you order.
you want a lesson? Is that what you want?
you want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.
is that what you want?
warden? They're ready, sir.
keep them here. We'll beat the other one later.
Yes, sir.
it's all right. It's all right, Jim. - I'm in bad shape, Ned.
for the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants...
when he seeth that their power is gone...
and there is none shut up, or left.
and he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted...
nobody move! Get back. Get down!
don't do this, my son.
open that door.
I'm gonna count to three. One...
go on, open it!
get in there.
here, put these on.
come on!
what do we do now?
tell them you got a man for the morgue.
man for the morgue! - Where's your pass?
come on!
I'm not sure this is such a good idea. - Nobody's asking you, Ned.
Bob, they catch us now, they'll kill us.
welcome aboard.
come on.
come on!
are we going, or are we dying?
come on.
come on!
all right, let's go.
look, Bob... - What?
get out!
ever hear the phrase "nothing to lose"?
get after them!
my God, you goddamn fools!
go!
wake up, Jimmy. Wake up.
rip it off. Rip the number off.
I'm cold.
I'm cold, too. Come on, walk it out.
I'm cold.
what happened to Bobby? You think they got him, Neddy?
look at this.
do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers...
for thereby some have entertained angels, unawares.
hebrews 13: 1. - Very touching.
Hebrews.
wait a second.
hello.
who the hell are you?
do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers...
for thereby some have entertained angels, unawares.
hebrews 13: 1.
what are you? Priests?
Yeah, that's right, we're priests.
you put her down, I'll give you a ride.
into the town, across the bridge, and we're free.
I'm sure they're looking for you.
what? - I'm sure they're looking for you.
who's looking for us? - The monastery, your fellow priests.
Yeah, I'm sure they're looking for us.
what, are you missing morning prayers?
Yeah, we're missing the whole program. What do you care?
I don't care a damn thing. I told you, it's all superstition, far as I'm concerned.
that's fine. Now you just drop us off at the town.
I'll tell you what else. You get people worked up.
you get people worked up over that shrine of yours, that Weeping Virgin.
we'll get out here.
won't be one more minute, I'll have you down.
no, we'll get out here.
well, I could use your help...
carry my deer to the butcher.
I'll tell you what, you go down to the garage...
and we'll come down and help you carry your deer for you.
why don't you just come with me?
we need a moment to compose our thoughts.
if it weren't for you, I'd never have killed that deer.
well, thank you for your courtesy. God bless you and all that.
can you swim, Jimmy? - No.
neither can I.
you think Bobby made it, Neddy? - Not like this, he didn't.
gotta ditch these togs.
come on.
what are you gonna do on free street, Neddy?
I'm gonna do it all, pally, and I'm gonna do it again.
and I'm gonna get two of the best of everything...
and anybody muck with me, they're going down!
come on.
ready?
I wonder what happened to Bobby. I wonder if he got across.
what happened, happened, Jim.
maybe they got him back. I'm not going back there.
that's right, we're not going back.
we look like a couple of Hoosiers. - That's right, let's go.
okay, let's go.
coins in the pocket. Coins in the pocket, that's good luck.
that's good luck, don't you think? - Right.
Oh, God. - It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
I can't go back there.
nobody's going back. It's gonna be just fine.
I gotta get some smokes, man, I'm telling you.
okay.
we'll get your smokes, and then we'll go across.
you take care of me, Ned, 'cause I got to get across.
keep walking. - I gotta get across.
just keep walking.
right with you.
just want a pack of tailor-mades.
Yeah, right with you.
bunch of damn nonsense.
all them damn priests in town at the shrine.
don't buy a damn thing...
but if they want something, you'd better have it on hand.
Thanks, Mrs. Harris. - Thank you.
be with you gents in a second. - We just want a pack of tailor-mades.
mementos of the shrine...
postcards, key chains of the Weeping Virgin.
not a penny in it, but they want it every year.
priests and tourists, put on that dumb show.
two packages of oatmeal. Set 'em down, will you?
account's getting a bit long.
well, I need it. Set 'em down.
I got a hungry kid. You'll catch me later.
what are you looking at?
Yeah, that's right.
special kind of smokes? - Luckys will do.
that shrine, talking about it, didn't mean to offend you.
kind of probably put my foot in it...
and you're tourists, come to see the shrine.
where are you folks from? - Here and there.
something I can interest you in that case?
we ought to be about going now.
we ought to be about going now!
you forgot your change. - That's okay.
sir, change. Let's see if we can't spend it in your store.
did you folks hear about the jailbreak?
no, can't say that we have.
where did you say you're from?
Yes, sir, it seems there were these three convicts...
shot their way out.
there you are. I told you I needed your help.
are these friends of yours, Caroline?
my help? - My car is stalled down at the garage.
I need you to haul that deer down to the butcher's.
you know these folks? - Know them? Yeah, they're priests.
this is Father...
I didn't catch your name.
priests? Oh, God.
Oh, God. I'm sorry, gentlemen... Father...
what I'm saying, rambling on...
I offended you. No hard feelings?
that's fine.
you gonna help me with that deer?
I mean, I'd die if I thought I'd offended you.
no big deal. - Or anybody associated with the shrine.
here, a little token. Take them, please.
take some back to your friends.
we've got the Weeping Virgin on one side...
thermometer on the other. Awful handy, really.
well, it's a cool day out. Button up.
no hard feelings, Father?
go with God.
I have that same coat.
Harry, here's a list.
also need a few shells for the old 12-gauge.
damn car is all stove in, fender busted, need a new radiator.
how am I gonna afford that?
I should sure enough go to your church, I swear to God.
why don't you?
everything's so expensive. Canned goods.
cheaper to shop in Canada. - Why don't you?
cause my car's wrecked.
if I walk over, how am I gonna get my groceries back?
after what you've done for us...
we'll go with you and fetch your things back.
very Christian of you.
you know what the Bible says.
what? What's that?
you know.
matter of fact, I usually do my shopping over there.
wouldn't let on to Harry.
you think that's dishonesty, you just go on and think it.
I can't do it. - You can, Jim, it's a piece of cake.
I can't do it.
you wanna kill yourself, that's fine...
but there's two of us here, and I'm counting on you.
so you buck up, Jimmy, and you act like a priest!
hail Mary, full of grace...
morning, Mrs. Blair. - How are you today?
you're working hard? - Well, we're looking...
for those convicts that escaped.
convicts...
Hey, I found 'em for you!
I found your two lost priests.
where have you been?
well, you know.
sheriff, you know who these are? - No.
Caroline has found our lost priests. This is Father Brown and Father Riley.
thank the Lord.
we thought maybe the convicts got you.
convicts. - Had a jailbreak.
got me some killers on the loose. That's all right, boy.
but where have you been? And where are your clothes?
they got lost when... You know.
found 'em coming through the woods.
looked like a couple of raggle-taggle gypsies.
gypsies? Do you know who these are?
this is Fathers Brown and Riley.
brown and Riley, A New Look At Revelation?
you're lucky. You say you were lost in the woods...
you're lucky one of my boys didn't get on to you, take you for the convicts.
what would they've done? - Done? Why, they would've shot you.
we've been meeting every bus for two days.
that's all right, boys, you let 'em through.
now you have a good day, now, Mrs. Blair.
we'd best be getting back now.
we gotta help Mrs. Blair with her groceries.
George!
run along over with Mrs. Blair and help her with her shopping!
we wired Arizona when you didn't arrive on time...
but they said they had no clue.
your monsignor is quite worried.
then the storm, and these prisoners...
I don't know. - I'll tell you something.
nothing was gonna keep us from coming here.
shall we go in?
get these chains knocked off at the blacksmith's...
then into these priest duds and back over the border.
you call it, Neddy.
coming? - Yeah.
I know this must be quite a moment for you...
having written so much about the shrine...
having never seen it.
that's why I took you back from the border.
I knew how much you wanted to be here.
thank you.
the Weeping Madonna.
I'm sure you'll find something here that'll fit.
God bless you both. - God bless you, Father.
God bless you.
father, we've been waiting for you eagerly.
we prayed for you.
we got delayed.
you know, you don't look a thing like your pictures.
fasting and prayer.
Yeah, it's such an honour to have men of your learning...
and of your reputation here.
we were so worried about you. - Yeah.
we wired the diocese in Arizona.
Yeah, he told us. We appreciate it.
well, thank the Lord you've come.
what's this?
you don't know what that is?
no.
it's a clothespin.
but, Father, why were you wearing it in your collar?
the thing of it is...
you know what it is?
no.
it's a reminder.
any of us could be snatched at any moment.
of course.
I'd like to add one special prayer of thanksgiving.
my brothers and guests here today...
a special prayer of thanksgiving for the safe arrival...
of Father Riley and Father Brown.
many of us are acquainted with their work...
and we are all, I'm sure...
glad of the opportunity to meet them in person.
we're thankful for their presence, their scholarship...
and their participation in the procession of the shrine.
today, a special blessing.
father Brown, would you render it for us?
I think you're Brown.
I think you're Brown. - You're Brown.
father Brown.
Bishop Nogalich points out it's his turn to say the grace.
please tell the Bishop we appreciate his courtesy...
in ceding his position to our new arrivals.
let him read. It's his turn.
I don't wanna get in anybody's face here.
no, Father Brown. Please. Honour us.
father...
if you could follow me to the lectern?
you know what?
let's just say something appropriate.
here's a good grace.
be nice to strangers, 'cause sometimes you're a stranger, too.
this is not a fitting grace.
what's wrong with it?
it's a bit unusual, but quite to the point, I thought.
what are we, Protestants?
as soon as we pop off the leg irons...
you listening?
Jimmy, get out of it, will you?
lay low here for a while, I'm gonna find some way...
to pop us out these chains and then we head across the river.
we're safe staying right here, Ned. - Yeah.
until the real priests show up, we're safe.
I hope you'll participate in our lectures later on in the shrine.
I'd like nothing better.
we get these leg chains off, then straight across the river.
you lay low around here. Half an hour, meet you right back here.
father Brown. - Who's Brown?
you are.
shall I enter your name in the lottery?
what's the prize?
don't bother.
no, I never won anything. - You can never tell. I'll put you down.
afternoon, Bill.
sheriff.
going to need them horses back this afternoon.
going back up in the hills again?
they got to be somewhere.
they got no food, prison clothes.
either they're up there in the woods or they're gonna cross down over here.
you got the bridge staked out pretty good, do you?
you best believe we do.
we're bringing out the dogs. The dogs will be here any minute.
we've got the prison staff, come down to stand guard on the bridge with us.
we'll catch them. Don't you worry.
bring them back whichever way they want.
you ask me, though...
I think it'd be a lot less problem, shoot to kill.
that's what the Bible says, isn't it?
they killed and they shall be killed.
yeah? - Yeah.
what was that? - Well, I don't know.
there she goes.
bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
it's been three weeks since my last confession.
I can't help myself.
please, Father.
what? - Help me.
okay, what is it? I can't help you if you don't tell me.
I've been sleeping with this woman.
all right, and you're not married to her?
no. - You're married to someone else?
my wife. - Your wife know about this?
no. - What are you worried about, then?
forget about it, stop whining. - But I broke my vow.
I'm such a sinner. Help me.
okay, look, try to break off seeing this broad.
say 10 Hail Marys, make a good act of contrition...
you see the girl again, pop back in, no big deal.
God bless you.
I can't, Father. I can't help myself. You have to help me.
now, look, I did what I could. You know, there's a time...
when a man's got to stand up, take a stand.
why don't you take a few days off...
no, I can't leave town till we catch those convicts.
I'm stuck here in town. I'm in a state of constant temptation.
please, I can't control myself. I need your help, Father.
you're a good man. You're a pious man. Help me.
how can I help you? - Come with me.
talk to her, talk to us together. - Look, buddy...
I've dragged her in sin, Father. - I'm sure you'll...
father, please, I'm begging you!
please, help me! - Get up.
please, Father, please. I need your help.
all right, okay.
okay. - Okay.
thank you, Father.
come on, get in there. Back, come on.
come on, take it out.
wait a minute. Take it out.
and I prayed.
I prayed to the Blessed Virgin, and I prayed to Saint Anne...
and I asked myself, "Why? Why am I so weak?
why am I branded?" And I say, "Lord...
I am a fornicator.
what am I doing to myself and to my wife?
I am a fornicator.
she can't hear, the poor child's deaf and dumb.
up here, Father.
I brought this priest here to avow our sins.
I don't care.
whore, we have sinned.
Hey, I don't care. And I told you I don't care.
you did what you did. If you think it's a sin, you live with it.
now, I'm busy now.
please, help me.
you got a problem? Stop coming here.
you think you're filthy? You think you're a swine?
all those names you say while we're doing it?
I'm gonna be sick.
you be sick, you be sick somewhere else.
well...
he's got no cause to be coming here like that.
you don't like the guy, what'd you go to bed with him for?
for $5.
what, do you have $5? I'll go to bed with you, too.
what, you think that's a sin? You think I care?
your mumbo-jumbo. You think I...
I slept with him, yeah, and I'll sleep with anybody that comes up with $5.
that's evil? Yeah, throw me out.
what you priests pay me to work here, do your own goddamn washing.
and don't you talk to me about God. Don't you tell me about sin.
your religion's so good, your God, get him to cure my little girl.
cure that girl out there. Your blessed shrine...
your Saint Anne...
your Weeping Virgin, yeah, cure my little girl.
get out of here. You've got your nerve.
I need a man.
I need a husband.
my little girl needs help.
I got nothing.
are you gonna give me those things?
are you gonna give me those things?
I wish I could.
I wish you could, too.
but you can't...
so why don't you just get the hell out of my life!
father, here.
what's this for? - It's for your beautiful project.
it's for the restoration of the shrine.
I can't thank you enough. God bless you.
it's for a good cause.
you don't know the half of it.
here, have a key chain. - Thank you.
actually, I got $5... - Get out of here!
I've had enough of your bullshit for one day.
come on.
son of a bitch. I knew it. Those convicts are here.
here, get the scent, quick, come on.
Yeah, who is it?
father? - Yeah, what is it?
I wanted to ask you...
a New Look At Revelation, you approached 10: 19...
love the stranger, for you yourselves "were strangers once in the land of Egypt.
and you used the word, a "sacrament.
you liked that?
Yes, I appreciated it.
and what I believed was an echo of the Gnostic.
the ecstatic mode.
that is say, a true...
well, that is to say...
a non-interpretive understanding of the text.
you got it.
I did?
I mean, I thought that I did. I just...
forgive me if I'm running on.
you know, here at the monastery...
we're enjoined to silence for most of the year.
yeah?
and, you know, it's such a pleasure when the bonds are lifted...
for the feast of the shrine.
and then, this week, to have all this company...
it's a heady thing.
well, and then we heard your bags were stolen, and...
well, in line with that verse, kindness to the stranger...
I wanted you to have these.
get out of here.
no. It's an honour.
it's an honour meeting you.
back at you. Hey, thanks.
well...
Oh, God.
here. We got to get out of here.
sheriffs are all over the place.
I really wanted to ask you, will you sign my book?
sure, give it to me.
we all especially enjoy your section about the shrine.
you liked that? - Yes, very much.
which one am I?
I think Father Brown and I, we have to talk.
father? Fathers?
will you be coming in the procession tomorrow?
depends on how things falls out. I can't give you a definite yes or no.
if you'll excuse us, we have to talk about writing things.
of course.
what took you so long? - I got lost.
look, that kid gave me his beads. - I'm very happy for you.
hold still.
thank you.
now, a dash across the river and it's free street, baby.
I'm with you, Neddy.
some booze and some broads and this country can kiss my ass!
we hit the border, you make the sign of the cross over the guy...
I make the sign of the cross... - Afternoon, Fathers.
afternoon.
open your book. Look in your book. Mumble something. Here we go.
open your book.
what do you think happened to Bobby? - I don't know. We'll talk about it later.
what's the first thing you're gonna do when you get free, Ned?
keep your mouth open, Jim...
and we'll talk about it on the northern side.
I'm gonna do something important. - Yeah, that's fine.
figure you're only alive so long...
you might as well do something with yourself.
piece of cake. Head in the book, read the book, mumble, over we go.
I just wanted to thank you. - You don't owe me anything.
it's so rare that someone cares, you know.
you didn't say I was weak. - You know, that's...
and I think I'm gonna tell my wife, just put it all at her feet.
that's a great idea. - Father, would you do me the honour...
of shaking my hand? - Sure.
thank you.
put Fathers Brown and Riley through.
thank you, Father.
George!
stand over here! Not there, here!
almost home free. We're almost home free.
head in the book.
good day, Fathers.
Oh, no. - What?
it's the warden.
no, don't run. It's okay. We're okay. It's okay.
one more minute, and over we go.
I can't go back to the joint, Ned.
you don't have to. Just read the book.
father, I'm looking forward to the procession.
friends of mine tell me you two are the authors of some pretty deep books.
you know, it depends on your taste.
I'd like to read them sometime, if I could.
I think of myself as a good Catholic.
we'll send you some. - I did a little writing myself once.
did you, now? That's great. - But I didn't have any luck selling it.
I was just wondering if you just might have look at this for me...
my goodness! Did we say our solemn prayer?
we're busy right now. - I understand.
gentlemen, it's all right. Let them through.
let them pass, please. Father.
sheriff, come here.
you instruct your men to shoot on sight or at my command.
$100 on the head of each man, dead.
you understand that? $100.
father?
you didn't answer my question.
is your shrine going to cure my little girl?
I mean, you told me to be true and I thought about it...
and I thought I would be true.
I'd be glad to be true. What's in it for me?
you understand? If I believe...
I can't talk to you now.
you could talk to me before, when all you had was shame and all.
why can't you talk now?
you're making a scene.
what's that compared to eternal life?
they've gotta be in this area...
or they would have frozen in the woods.
you got a lot of spunk. Why don't you get out of here? Beat it! Get out of here!
screw you, Your Holiness!
you think I didn't see...
the way you looked at me when I said I'd go to bed with you?
will you, for Christ's sake, will you shut up?
what are you, too scared or too cheap?
if God really made the world, he should have put some men in it.
you want to answer my question, Father?
I can't do it.
you want to lead us to the shrine?
you want to wash away our sins? I'm ready to change.
get this thing up!
damn you!
I'm already damned, Father. I'm damned to hell for adultery.
I'm damned for eternity.
what's a little rudeness going to get me? Two more weeks?
that's what I want to know. Everybody's saying how I...
go away. Get out of here.
you had no business to come to my room.
get out of here. - What, was that the act of a man?
Yeah. Who are you? You don't know what your life is.
you don't know what my life is. Who are you? Live your own life!
Hey, why don't you? Who the hell are you to talk to me?
why are you stuck up in a monastery? Watch my little girl.
we have a populace. - You do not have a populace.
when I am gone, you have a populace.
until then, all you've got is a bunch of suspects.
all right, how do we get past the warden?
she's deaf.
okay, we can do this.
just need a little thought. We need a plan. We're not gonna panic.
every house, clear it out!
send in the dogs! Smoke them out! - People live here.
I don't give a goddamn! People can live here when those men are dead.
now, just go easy. - Easy?
you've got the wrong man.
you got the convict clothing? - What? Yes.
we're going to go house to house.
take some men around there. Go around there.
do it.
you stay here on the side with me. - Get the dogs, come on.
follow me, over here. This way.
we've been in tougher spots than this before.
he's over there!
easy, boy!
who's in there?
good evening. - Hi there.
good luck on the lottery tomorrow.
you're not wearing any shoes.
brings us closer to the earth.
so this is the statue that cries? - I guess it is.
and what does it do? It grants wishes?
Yeah.
I know what I'd wish for right now.
I'd wish for two new pairs of shoes.
please, lady, give me and Ned two new pairs of shoes.
I say we try the river tonight, Ned.
what do we do? Walk on the water?
steal a boat?
they got the waterfront sewed up tighter than a football.
Hey, what are you... We're not going back.
I mean, Bob got across.
you don't know that Bobby got across.
we got to believe that, Ned. We got to.
we do? - Oh, yeah.
Why?
because if we don't, what are we going to believe?
where you going?
to prayers and dinner.
get back!
I'm telling you, nobody lives here except for the goddamn... monks.
lady, I know you think I'm a bad guy, but I know...
I know you been watching me. But I'm not a bad person.
please, don't let them take me back.
please don't let them take me back.
please...
the Weeping Madonna.
Hello, Father.
that's the wonderful thing about what you've written.
you and your friend.
we must never forget that it's simply a hole in the roof.
Yeah.
that's why we were so glad you could come.
you know, your notion on the true meaning of a miracle...
I just want to thank you.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
no, I was just...
the word you're looking for is "praying," I believe.
it's not easy being a priest all the time. I understand.
don't worry.
it'll be all right, my son.
sometimes...
sometimes I...
I just need help.
there is no help.
did you ask her?
I suppose I did.
for what?
for help to get from one place to another place.
she's never let me down.
will you be marching in the procession tomorrow?
no, Father, in truth, I have other things to do.
I understand.
that is a long walk into Canada.
into Canada?
Yes, it's a long walk, all the way with the shrine, into Canada.
are we still doing that? - What?
we're carrying it, the thing, into Canada?
Yes, we're still doing it.
across the bridge to our sister church on the Canadian side.
thank you.
I changed my mind. I want to march in the procession.
it's too late. - What do you mean, too late?
you're late. You're a day late. - We got delayed.
we've just closed up the list.
well, open the list up. - Can't do it.
what do you mean, you can't do it?
can't do it.
you want me to go above your head?
he doesn't understand the meaning of the phrase.
he doesn't? It means, I'm going to go to the head man...
I'm gonna rat you out. I got a problem. I got a right to march in that procession.
you sign me up!
this is not a Christian attitude.
you know what? You tell him, "tough!
he says that there's something wrong about you.
yeah? You tell him he don't know the half of it...
unless he puts my name on that list.
all right.
who will your afflicted be?
I'm sorry?
he says, "Are you deaf?" Who will your afflicted be?
afflicted?
who will be the afflicted person you will be escorting in prayer...
for the intercession of the Virgin?
we just thought we'd be going ourselves.
Yes, that's lovely. Let's live our lives with no rules at all.
now, who will be the sick or crippled or disabled person...
whom you will be escorting across?
Hey!
Where's your mother?
Where's your mother?
Where's Mommy?
Mr. Holiness.
let me help you with this. - No. I don't need your help.
I want to ask you something.
you want to take me upstairs for a ride? You've got your nerve.
Yeah! I'm a sinner!
big of you to say so.
but I want to change. - Good luck.
I want to take your little girl on the procession of the shrine.
you go to hell! - Why, what's the matter?
you don't believe... - I told you, piss off!
I don't need your magic show.
if God wants to take your little girl...
I told you, I don't want your goddamn mumbo-jumbo.
and I won't let you curse my kid with it.
wait a second. Please.
isn't there anything which would change your mind?
what could I do to change your mind?
I'll tell you what would convince me. - What?
Jimmy. Jim... Father Brown?
Hey, Ned. - I have to talk to you.
is there anything else I should know? I mean, at all?
is this too scratchy? - Jimmy!
you get used to it.
I have to talk to you.
not now, Ned. - Jimmy.
I've got it whipped, okay? I made my mind up.
what?
I'm going to check into a deal here. - What deal?
father Brown was going to join our order.
what?
it's three squares and a cot. - Jimmy!
I told you, Ned, I'm not going back in.
I got the way out, Jimmy.
you do? - Yeah.
we're about 300 feet from freedom and I can get us across.
don't go native on me now.
what are you trying to do? Shanghai my pal?
changed our minds. Sorry, changed our mind.
I can't believe it, Ned. They're going to catch us.
no, I promise you.
all we need is $100 off that shrine out there.
when the procession starts...
I am going to be holding on to a part of the float.
okay, good.
then Father Levesque will say:
suffer the little children to come unto me.
here, take one of these.
then I will hold out my hands...
then you will come forward with the child...
bring the afflicted child forward... - Okay.
...so that the child can join the group...
of afflicted children.
I'm trying to explain these rules to you...
I'm listening.
...so that you will be able to follow them when the time comes.
okay, good.
then the child will stand in the group.
you will stand near the child... - Okay.
...and wait for the signal from Father Levesque.
okay, good. - Are you following this?
because we won't be able to discuss it at the time.
we can only discuss it now.
hail Mary.
now, first, we will all gather into the square.
and then there will be the brass band, and the children's choir...
will say the Ave Maria.
and then they will raise the crucifix.
the altar boys will gather.
father Levesque will raise his hand, and then you say what?
I say, "Follow...
I will pray for the inter...
the intercession. - "Intercession...
for the unfortunates. - Yes.
you got my money? The procession's starting in 15 minutes.
excuse me, aren't we going to finish discussing this?
Yeah, it's going be fine, will you?
Hey, you are one money-grubbing bitch! What's the matter with you?
whatever, but the kid don't march in the parade without I get $100.
you're going to get your goddamn money!
how'd you get this way?
none of your business. What are you to me? Nothing.
you want me to pray, you want me to screw...
you want me to march in the parade? Pay me.
nice talk in front of your kid.
she can't hear you. She's deaf!
they shot him!
they shot who?
the one they were looking for, the convict.
he was trying steal the money.
Jimmy!
they shot the convict!
he tried to get away, but they had to shoot him.
ah hell, Jimmy. Where?
he ran inside the general store.
they chased him inside the general store and he tried to get a gun.
move!
coming through.
warden, I was just about to...
send for the doc. Get some more men over here.
it's him. We've got our convict.
I think he needs a priest.
I'm a priest.
father, I've been shot.
I'm very happy for you.
he was trying to steal. I saw him over by the gun case...
come on, get him out of here. Get him locked up.
he's gonna die, let him die in jail.
it's a priest. Let him through.
Jimmy, I'm so sorry I told you we got to get out of here.
what are you talking about? I ain't gonna die.
get this goddamn priest out of here!
Bobby!
this man is on his last leg. Come on, hurry up.
get out of the way, move back.
come on, get that goddamn thing in here.
gently. - Come on, get him down there.
now, look, he give you any sass, you let him drown in his own blood.
Ned?
wait a minute! Get me that priest!
I want to talk to that priest!
father, this way now.
I want to confess my sins!
you son of a bitch, ain't there a Christian among you?
all right, Father. This way.
he don't look that sick.
excuse me. - I don't think he's religious.
get me that priest!
forgive this poor boy for what he did.
he knew not what he did. Deliver him from evil. Amen.
let him...
let his soul rest in some peace for all the terrible sins he did.
he was a bad person, but he repents for his sins.
bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
I thought you were dead.
it's been a long time since my last confession.
Yeah, but why'd you have to shoot that deputy, Bob?
cut the comedy, you would've done the same thing.
I'm not asking you where you got the priest togs, am I?
that's your business.
just tell me how we get out of here.
I'm sorry for you, Bob.
you're what?
you stand to gaff for the men you shot. I am so sorry.
and if there's anything I could do to make you more comfortable...
what, are you joking?
what can I do, Bob? You know...
you!
doc says you're going to live long enough for us to fry you.
escape from prison.
murder of two guards.
murderous assault on an officer.
now, Father, you finish up here.
I'm coming back in here in five minutes.
and then you're going to tell me where those other two men are.
that's right.
what can I do, Bob? What can I do to get you out of here?
I don't know, but you better do it, or I'm gonna turn you in.
they'll send us back inside. - Inside?
no, you won't be going back inside. I rat you out...
we're all gonna fry for those guards we shot.
excuse me?
you shot the guards, Bob.
no, I think not. I think you shot the guards.
no. You shot the guards, Bob.
no, I think you shot them!
I think that you shot the guards.
and I think that that's going to be my dying confession.
so what are you going to do to get me across that border?
father, are you about done? - Yeah.
I believe he's dying.
I'm going back. I have to get another priest...
to help me administer the last rites.
we'll be upstairs, Father.
here, put this on. I couldn't get the $100.
where the hell you been? - Bobby's in the slammer.
what? - Yeah.
he's in the jail. He shot a cop, and they shot him.
they got him here?
look, he saw me. He knows we're here.
he's gonna rat us out unless we help him escape.
we have to take him with us.
I don't get it. He says he's gonna rat us out?
let him rot in there! - I'm way ahead of you.
he says either he sees us coming back to save him...
or he blows the whistle before we can get across.
he's giving us five minutes. - How are we gonna get across?
I have no idea.
and now, as is traditional at this time before our procession...
we will have the drawing of our lottery.
and now, I call up to stand beside me...
father Brown.
father Brown?
there he is.
father Brown.
it's another Father Brown.
no, it's another Father Brown. It's not this one.
Ned...
father Brown.
I never won anything before.
I'm really anxious to get back down there...
so the procession will go on.
it is with great happiness that I present to you Father Brown...
whom, we may say, the hand of G|od himself...
has chosen to deliver this year's sermon...
on the miraculous properties of the shrine of the Weeping Virgin.
father Brown.
God...
have you ever felt completely alone?
alone in a world of danger, and no one to rely on?
danger on every hand.
in a world fraught with danger.
and at the brink of death...
I felt in my pocket...
and what did I find?
what did I find?
nothing.
there's nothing there.
it's all in your head.
they can take the money from you.
they can take the position from you.
I don't know, they can whip you.
people turn their back on you.
everything happens to everybody.
and you ain't gonna find nothing in your pocket that can stave it off!
nothing can stave it off!
pain.
affliction. We say, "power.
power doesn't do it.
cause you'll never have enough.
money?
I don't know. You know anybody who has enough? Still...
trouble befalls us.
everyone has that sadness in their heart.
some people are meant to be hard.
I don't know. It seems like they are.
we meet them.
is G|od good?
I don't know.
all I know is...
something might give you comfort.
and maybe you deserve it.
if it comforts you to believe in G|od...
you do it. That's your business.
people have guilty...
you know, guilty secrets.
but if that's yours...
that you want to go believe in something...
well, that's not so bad.
all right. I don't want your money.
just take the kid on the procession and pray for her.
and just you be careful and hold her hand.
what's this?
this is our ticket across the bridge.
we got to get out of here. We got 10 seconds.
don't move.
if there's any trouble, I'm coming out shooting.
if there's any trouble, it's too late.
trust me, you'll be the first to go.
what's he doing here?
how'd Bob get here?
I'll tell you later. Come on, let's get out of here.
they take the Madonna that belongs jointly to us...
and the sister parish across the river in Canada...
and the priests, they just walk it over there and...
he's gone!
tell those men to go down to the river.
come on, let's go!
warden, I'm so sorry.
for all those who labour and are heavily laden.
my God.
nobody move!
Hey! Come back here!
any trouble?
not the girl, Bob, not the girl.
shut up!
Molly!
no. - Molly.
get her!
No! Rosie.
damn, just let me go!
so long.
No!
Rosie!
help me! Please!
Fred, help them out.
that's okay. I'm gonna get back across.
back across with the shrine. Have to get...
father, thank you. You saved my little girl.
thank you so much. - Don't thank me, thank God.
she's talking. Oh, my God, she's talking.
my baby's talking.
he...
convict.
you've got to keep my secret. Please.
I cannot.
please. Do good works count for nothing?
come on, please, don't betray me.
he's a convict.
is this true? - Yes.
you're a convert?
Yes, we were both born... Lutheran.
God forgives you.
George!
quite a show yesterday.
true bread and circuses. - You liked that, huh?
it's a true misapplication of the teachings of Christ.
you know, we're all entitled to that now.
you keep smiling.
about time.
something funny.
I'd have been just as happy staying here.
isn't that funny?
Yeah, it's hysterical. Come on.
father Brown!
we missed you at Matins.
I kind of missed it, too. But what are you going to do?
are you coming to Lauds?
I think Lauds have their place...
but as it is, we got to get over to Canada.
you know how it is. - Father Brown.
I'd like to stick around and enjoy your hospitality and so forth.
father Brown!
we all enjoyed your sermon last night.
that's good. I'm glad you did.
are you leaving with the others?
Yes, I think we are. We have to.
father Brown.
we got to go. - Father Brown.
funny, right? I could have stayed in there.
Yeah, I told you it was funny. Now calm down, okay?
we get to the border, you make the sign of the cross over the guy...
I make the sign of the cross over the guy, over we go. Okay?
okay.
see you at vespers. - You bet your life.
I suppose I should thank you.
happy to serve.
Yeah, I suppose it's a miracle.
still asleep?
Yeah, doc says she should sleep till noon.
thank God.
what was she shouting at us yesterday?
speaking in tongues.
you worked a miracle. Is that the truth?
believe what you want to believe.
are you still trying to pick a fight with me? Still?
No! No, I'm not picking a fight.
no, matter of fact, I was moved.
I was thankful what happened. What, is that so strange?
no, not strange at all.
then, what about this?
I was moved and I'm thinking about I'll take holy orders.
holy orders? - Yeah.
you sure that's what you want to do?
well, can you think of a better idea, Father?
a better idea?
Yeah. Maybe I can.
a better idea?
you want to share it with me, Father?
all in good time.
this is all you have to do right now, and it is enough.
come on.
breathe, rachel.
mother of francis!
No! Jo friday, off!
Hello! A little help!
come on! The play's at second! - What are you doing?!
well, at least somebody's appreciative.
Hey! Jo fri - Off, jo friday.
Jane, what are you doing? - Why'd you give the dog our burgers?
you want food? Go hunt and gather, all right?
okay, if that's a pizza, i'm sorry for anything I have ever done, especially, tommy, when I locked you out of the house and pretended like I didn't know who you were.
did she really do that? - Still crying over it.
daddy.
so, you gonna invite your old man in, or what?
level of decomposition suggests she's been here for at least two days.
she's still not picking up. - She does have a personal day.
still... This is the first case they're working together since the shooting.
look at this.
professional frenemies? Cop shoots medical examiner's mob father.
Sheesh. That's bad.
Jane didn't have a choice.
paddy would have pulled the trigger on us.
you and I know that, but how would you feel if I shot your father?
my father's not a mobster.
you having a hot flash?
your cologne not working for you today?
the medical community is debating if men go through menopause.
you could be experiencing a decrease in testosterone.
I got plenty of testosterone.
how about you, Frost?
love the smell of deco in the morning.
Ooh, maggots like it, too. Look here.
steam from the pipes has accelerated decomposition.
you know, few students know about these old tunnels.
21/4 miles of them run beneath the university.
they were constructed to house steam pipes...
they should just apologize for whatever they said to each other in that cat fight.
cat fight"? Women hate that expression.
they do?
damn. So many new rules.
Hey, janie, you got any more chips?
can you believe the contract they gave this guy, huh?
calls himself a pitcher. Can't even throw the speed limit.
good one, Tommy.
Oh! What are you doing?
pilgrims lost 8-7. - Jane
you disappear for a year, and then you show up to "bro-out" over a day-old dvr'd ballgame?
I came here...
to give you this, okay?
once upon a time, two wonderful people fell in love"?
you're gonna love lydia. She's a dynamite lady.
Tommy, something you want to say?
leave your brother alone.
Tommy? - No. I mean...
look, We see each other when I'm in town, all right? - When you're in town?
you know, tommy's the only one who never - Who never judged me.
well, tommy's always been so flexible about what's right and wrong.
I don't want you bullying your baby brother. - That doesn't work anymore, pop.
talk, tommy.
I introduced him... To lydia.
wait till you meet her.
you're divorced, so how do you plan on having this big catholic wedding?
Yeah, the church kind of frowns on that.
just some paperwork I got to fill out.
what kind of paperwork?
Oh, my god.
you're gonna try to get an annulment, aren't you?
janie, it's a piece of paper. It means nothing.
does ma know she didn't mean to have kids?
look, I have no desire to hurt your mother, all right?
she doesn't know, does she?
you haven't even had the guts to tell her.
so, I guess that makes us all bastards.
Hey. Where you been?
my father remembered he had a family and popped by.
Wow. My dad's a too.
no, I'm busy feeling sorry for myself.
now I got to feel sorry for you, too?
well, this'll cheer you up.
we got a body.
Rachel lawson, 25.
grad student in earth and planetary sciences.
now I feel sorry for her, too. Where's the body?
Where's the body? - It's down there.
how long she been there?
looked like a couple of days, but you could ask
relax, Frost. I'll ask Dr. Isles.
victim rented a car. It's parked outside. There's nothing in it.
here's the rental car agreement.
BCU campus car." She was a v. i. p.
she rented a car every weekend for the last 20 weeks?
Yeah, it's a lot of mileage. See?
maybe she was going home. - She's from boston.
she wasn't due to return the car until tomorrow.
well, where was she going, and why'd she come back early?
studies show that 5% to 7% of the male pop
hello... Detective rizzoli.
Hello, Dr. Isles.
well, I don't see any drag marks.
no. Lividity confirms that she was killed here.
she's passed through rigor.
so she's been dead at least 36 hours.
she's in workout clothes. What was she doing down here?
she was strangled.
thank you, doctor. I can see that.
looks like the weapon was a garrote. - Garrote.
gee, I would love a history lesson on the... garrote.
wouldn't you, frost?
well, it was most popular in the 17th century when it was used as a means of silent assassination by the thuggee cult in india.
well, let's be on the lookout for the thuggees.
what are those red patches?
urticaria. - Urticaria?
uh, maybe you'll know what this means.
the yucky red stuff is a rash.
thank you for clearing that up. - yes, that was a good explanation.
let's go.
you stay.
you have any idea what rachel was doing in the steam tunnels?
steam tunnels? What steam tunnels?
you have any idea what this is?
it was rachel's?
okay, let's take it with us.
uh, Where's her bedroom?
should I be worried?
in horror movies, they always get the roommate next.
the campus is on high alert, and there are campus police outside your apartment.
you'll be safe.
and here I thought I missed out on the whole "roommate bonding" thing.
Oh, what a relief
cruelty free cotton.
I hate it when people are mean to cotton.
and vegan shoes. Can you say "vugly"?
says the woman who's been wearing the same boots for the past two years.
Oh, snap!
okay, rachel had a "skinny" section and a "fat" section.
how do you know about "skinny-fat" clothes?
I've tried on all sizes.
Oh, snap again!
all right, what do we got here?
loofah, aloe vera toothpaste...
a crystal... - That's a deodorant.
how do you know?
told you - all sizes.
Oh, hello!
here's a sure way to keep the weight off.
cocaine.
Why?
why would somebody do this?
Rachel was the kindest person.
did rachel mention any problems she was having? Maybe with friends?
no. She was there to study environmental geology.
she was very dedicated.
she worked very hard.
was she seeing anyone? - no.
she wouldn't have talked to you about that.
Mr. Lawson, did you just come from a business trip?
no. Why?
your watch is set to a different time than your wife's.
are you separated?
Yeah.
did you tell rachel?
I told rachel I was leaving her mother...
when I brought her back to school after winter break.
that's when she started going down into the tunnels, isn't it?
we don't know why she was there.
why do you say that?
Rachel wasn't an only child.
she had an older sister.
Emily died when rachel was 7.
Rachel would go down into the basement.
she would sit there in the dark for hours.
when she was really suffering, she'd find a place...
it was my fault she was in those tunnels.
this may not be my place...
but this beautiful girl loved you both very much.
honor her by being kind to each other.
you just pulled a midnight. What, did you take another shift?
all this stuff with pop, i'd figured I'd at least make some overtime.
you talk to maura yet?
Frankie, I don't think we're ever gonna be friends again.
we just keep making it worse.
okay. Thank you. Yes.
dad hasn't told her? - no.
I ran a check on her. On lydia.
Frankie, you can't be doing that.
they watch stuff like that, all right?
What'd you find out? - You don't want to hear it.
no, I don't. Tell me everything.
she's 28 years old.
she's younger than us!
Hey, rizzoli. You got a minute? - Yes, sir.
Hey, frankie. - Hey. Lieutenant.
look, how we doing with that murdered bcu girl?
I'm getting a lot of heat from the brass.
parents are going nuts over there.
Yes, I haven't actually... Spoken to maura - Dr. Isles...
just sign it, and then everything is fine.
are you okay, rizzoli? Is everything all right?
just do me that favor. Okay? - Sure. Sure, I'll sign it.
good. - Over your dead body!
all these years I had to put up with your snoring!
my snoring?! What about your creams and your - and your flossing?
in the bed, you flossed! - That's right!
in our marriage bed, where we made three children! - Ma, come on.
that's right, and you still treat them like kids. Okay, move on, angela!
Frank, come on. This isn't the time or place. Let's take it outside.
this is not your business. I'm talking to my wife. - Your ex-wife.
I will not dishonor our children! I won't do it!
I idolized you. You know that?
Janie... - No, no. I don't want to hear it.
you need to go, pop.
ma...
Hey. Maura.
how you doing?
how'd you get down here? - Oh, I got my ways.
Tommy, this area is secure.
Yeah. I'm on the job.
Murphy's funeral home need more pick-up guys.
guess your people are too busy with murders, so they hired me to pick up the ones that just croak.
well, great. Congratulations.
so, listen, I, um... I kind of need some advice.
from me? Sure. Shoot.
well, you know my dad's back.
I heard about what happened at the cafe.
Jane told you?
no. Jane and I are... Not so,
close as - As we used to be.
well, you know my dad's getting remarried, right?
Yeah, he told us today.
no wonder jane was so off.
well, I mean, it's kind of a good thing that you and jane aren't talking.
Oh, no, it's not. It's awful.
well, I just mean, you know, now that you're not talking, - maybe we could - Tommy.
what? A guy's got to dream, right?
advice. You said you needed advice.
right. I'm gonna tell you something, but you can't tell anyone.
I'm a vault.
I, uh...
I kind of...
know... My dad's fiancee.
know." As in the biblical sense?
Yeah. That sense.
I - I mean, I only "knew" her one time, but that's just still wrong, right?
I mean, do you think I should tell my dad?
lower extremities are well-muscularized, no evidence of trauma.
results are in on the white powder.
what, from the victim's apartment?
was it cocaine?
negative for cocaine.
well, what was it? Heroin? Crystal meth? Ketamine?
sodium. Bicarbonate.
tricky. Baking soda.
thank you, susie. - Uh, you're welcome.
nice work, senior criminalist chang.
nice work, chief medical examiner maura.
well, that explains why rachel had white powder in her shower caddy.
caddy"?
livor mortis is indiscernible.
okay. I'm sorry.
please explain to me why she had baking soda in her caddy.
you were just being nice because you want information.
she used it to wash her hair.
it's less toxic to the environment than shampoo.
well, that's commitment.
she's really fit, yeah?
she's had anterior dislocations to both her left and right humerus bones.
I'd love to know why that's relevant. It's too bad you don't guess.
well, you're in luck. It's national guessing day.
are you celebrating? - I am.
she has these injuries because of repeated chaturanga dandasana to urdhva mukkha svanasana.
I know what that is - Yoga.
are you breaking out in hives from the guessing? - Not yet.
and her rash is the result of "defatting,
the chemical dissolution of dermal lipids.
what's that in "yucky rash" lingo?
she was submerged in icky stuff.
Oh, submerged, great.
so the vegan girl is bathing in chemicals - great.
what? I thought we were done.
okay.
Rachel was not snorting coke. - What was she doing with it?
washing her hair.
that's expensive shampoo. You
it was baking soda, all right, frost?
so why was she in the tunnels, who was in there, and why did they kill her?
Jane, you should, uh - - Did you check her financials?
she owed bcu 27 grand, which - Which is weird because...
it was all covered with student loans and grants.
so what'd she do with all that money?
I'll get a subpoena for her bank records.
Yeah, we got to figure out what this is.
Oh! Nice t. p. Tail.
what?
why didn't you tell me?
tell you what? - We didn't even notice.
Yeah, right. They can see it from across the street.
God, can this day get any worse?!
sorry.
I found the symbol on rachel's tile.
there it is. It's trademarked.
sensel matta yoga.
Rachel's bank shows automatic monthly payments to the same place.
she spent $25, 000 on yoga?
in five months? Enlightenment is expensive.
owner's name is... Sensel matta.
well, that's not the name his mother gave him.
yoga studio is nearby. Come on, let's go talk to him.
he went to a lot of trouble to hide his identity.
maybe we keep it on the down low so we don't spook him?
stop!
frost, track his business records, find out what his real name is.
come on, korsak. Let's go do some yoga.
crap. - What?
floater just beached himself on the north bank of the charles.
man, you're lucky.
it's probably a suicide. You'll make detective.
Yeah, when I'm 104.
come with me.
Really? - Yeah, come on.
would you pay 25 grand to look like that?
Nah. I'd rather drink my six-pack. Have a boston whaler with a tuna tower.
welcome. Love and light.
Oh, I'm sorry, this is a caffeine-free zone.
I'm - I'm sorry. We had no idea.
Oh, that goes in composting. The middle one.
it's so wonderful when couples come in together.
Oh, we're not a - - Accustomed to... Such a nice yoga studio.
yoga is an excellent way to keep up with the demands of a young wife.
and I'm very demanding.
whew, you sure are... Babe.
I teach a beginners' class in a few minutes. You'll take it.
Oh, no, no, no. No. We're not dressed for yoga.
actually, we would like to meet sensel matta.
nobody meets the master until after class.
you have anything a little less... Stretchy?
his eyes and his tongue are gone.
that's from fish activity, right?
looks different in the books.
he's got moobs. - It's from the bloating.
he's been in the water a... A while.
Hey. Look at his forehead. You think that's fish activity?
it could be blunt force trauma.
so it might not be a suicide. Right?
come here. Grab his arm. We can pull him out ourselves, right?
I'll get him.
Tommy. What are you doing here?
working. What?
you think you and jane are the only rizzolis that can look death in the face?
move.
all right.
how about you? Can you look death in the face?
and as we easily hold our balance, take your gaze to the ceiling and breathe.
with your right hand flat on the floor, take that left arm and extend it to the ceiling and reach.
as we move from half-moon ardha chapasana, into an easy variation king dancer...
if it's so easy, why doesn't she come up with something harder?
I'm scared. - Can you please stay on your own mat?
if you can't do this simple pose, just do adho mukha svanasana.
I'd like to adho mukha svanasana her. - I'll help.
apparent skull fracture.
holy crap, it's my first murder.
stop right there! I can't take it. I can't do it.
what? W - what'd I say?
this man might have hit his head when he jumped.
or slammed into rocks when his bungie cord snapped.
for all I know, wile e. Coyote dropped an anvil on his head.
it was just a gut feeling. I
this is a scientific process. Do you understand, officer?
you do not guess, leap to conclusions, speculate, theorize, wonder, or tell me about your gut. Am I clear?
Yeah.
clear.
I hope you experienced a little bit of love and light transformation.
words cannot begin to express.
Yeah, we're so transformed, we're ready to meet sensel matta.
he rarely leaves his spiritual retreat in western massachusetts.
but you said after - - It's a ways, but it might be worth it.
what's the address? - You can't know that until you ascend.
that girl, hon - What was her name? Rachel...?
Oh, rachel lawson, the one that told us about this place.
that's the one, yes.
she said she'd been to the retreat.
Rachel ascended very quickly.
huh. Must be flexible.
sensel matta believes rachel is, uh... Spiritually gifted.
I'll get you packets to fill out.
now that you're ready to ascend, you'll put a credit card on file.
Rachel's parents said she didn't have a boyfriend.
Yeah. Bet they didn't know she was "spiritually gifted," either.
I got a bad feeling. - Me too.
anything? - Yeah. A lot.
got a name - matthew moore. That's your sensel matta.
well, how are we gonna find his retreat in all of western mass?
what are these shaded areas? - I've been busy.
sensel matta yoga bought 20, 000 acres there, all within the last year.
it's all protected land. how?
using their nonprofit religious exemption.
now I really have a bad feeling.
I've also been through all of bcu's security footage of tunnel entrances.
Rachel started going in five months ago.
right after her parents separated.
then she stopped for months. Started going again two weeks ago.
I want to know what happened two weeks ago. - Me too.
last time was three days ago, the day she was murdered.
no one followed her.
there's a lot of tunnel entrances in campus buildings. Somebody was in there.
the victim's rash was caused by benzene and 1, 4-dioxane, likely from a fresh water source.
I've narrowed it down to seven lakes in western massachusetts.
are you saying those lakes are polluted? - I'm not.
the ph levels and mineral content are.
swell.
my sprout troop used to have sleepover camps at one of those lakes.
you were a sprout trooper?
Yes. Why is that so hard to believe?
you mean because it is your "duty as a sprout trooper to be kind, friendly, generous"?
I was so sweet and kind, I won "sweetest camper.
two years in a row. So, ha ha ha.
was anyone else there?
to watch you... Accept your award?
nice recovery.
the pollution must be recent because it's not showing up in any of the water quality reports.
bet you that's where rachel was driving that campus car to.
well, it's a small needle in a big haystack.
I am going there and doing my own water quality testing.
Hey! Dr. Isles...
since you're going anyway, would you get a statement from matthew moore?
goes by the name of sensel matta.
you can't have a medical examiner go get a statement from a suspect.
that's my job.
Hey! You two can go together.
I'm sure she's taking a different road.
there's only one. - You're right. I am.
I have to go get a few things.
I'll tell cavanaugh.
swing and a miss.
Where's your car?
Hey, mo, it's korsak.
Hey! My car!
what are you doing to my car?! - Uh, my job.
I don't know how many times I've told you about parking here.
I park here every day, mo. - Oh, not today.
have a great rest of your day, all right?
I'm gonna rent a car. - Yeah, me too.
don't forget your lunch!
what is that? - Mortadella on foccacia bread, with a little roasted red pepper.
Korsak put you up to this?
all I'm going through, and you two can't be civil?
don't you dare pull the annulment card.
he wants me to sign a paper that says I didn't want you kids!
ma, we're grown-ups. We know you wanted us.
if you're such a grown-up, then act like one and stop this!
just saw big mo towing your cars.
you want to borrow mine? - Oh, you're good.
one little thing for your mother, and you can't do it?
it is more energy efficient if we take one car.
fine, but I'm driving. - Why do you get to drive?
because it's an unmarked, and because I'm a cop, and becau - Just get in the car, maura!
have a good time, girls.
I am not listening to led zeppelin. - I'm not listening to yo-yo ma.
I don't listen to yo-yo ma...
...in the car.
Oh, that's right, pardon me.
yo-yo ma's just for the jacuzzi.
put your seatbelt on! - it's on!
the next lake is 42. 3910 degrees north.
longitude? Really? Can you just tell me to "turn left at popeye's chicken"?
there is no popeye's chicken in western massachusetts.
72. 3830 west.
the acoustic vibrations of hard rock have been shown to increase the risk of an accident.
did you pass gas?
no, I did not!
okay.
Hey, ma. - Are you girls having fun?
Oh, yeah, we're great.
Maura's having gastrointestinal issues. - I am not!
Jane used to fart on long car rides and blame her brothers.
did you just say "fart"?
have you listened to the audiobook yet? It's in the cooler.
what to do when your former best friend is a bitch
Really?
too bad it's wet!
have fun. Love you both.
Bye, ma.
our charles river floater is paul mcnamara.
he was a professor at waltham university.
professor of hydrology. Studied groundwater.
fracking is an invasive way to extract natural gas.
proponents say it will liberate the u. s. From dependence on foreign oil.
but my research indicates it will destroy the environment.
750, 000 views. wow.
popular professor.
not everybody loved him. Listen to this comment.
what does this idiot tree hugger want us to put in our gas tanks?
how about his blood?
somebody killed him. - We don't know that, frankie.
you saw the front of his head.
Oh, wait. you - You didn't, did you?
remind me not to invite you to my next floater.
go straight past the coniferous spruce.
maybe I'll pass a hemlock, too.
Oh, look. A homo sapien.
Oh, crap. In a guard booth.
love and light. - Love and light.
you here for the retreat? - yes.
okay, what's your name?
our names may not be on your list.
we - we just ascended. Today, in fact.
well, unless you have your double platinum soul certificate,
I can only allow you go as far as the public picnic area.
well, we understand.
love and light. - Love and light.
let's hope he doesn't run that.
there's the lake.
nothing gets past you.
hurry up.
shoot!
we need to leave. - No, I need to talk to matthew moore.
no. Listen to me. We're in danger.
those don't look like yogis. What did you take a picture of?
I'll tell you in the car.
please! Trust me.
Rachel definitely swam in that lake. And I know why it's so polluted.
I saw fracking equipment. - What is fracking?
it's a controversial process to drill for natural gas.
they pump hundreds of chemicals thousands of feet underground.
it pollutes groundwater. - You've got to be kidding me.
that's why we pulled a thelma and louise?
well, Jane, it's illegal here.
Rachel was a geologist.
maybe sensel matta didn't bring her here to sleep with her.
maybe he brought her here to help. - Yeah, but she wouldn't have helped.
her interest was in the environment. - Exactly.
so maybe she saw what you saw, she uncovered the fracking, and that's what
you okay?
I - I think so.
Oh, crap. My phone is wet.
what? What? Can you move your leg? - No, it's stuck.
okay.
get down! Get down! Get down!
Maura, get out of the car. - I can't get my leg out!
Maura, get out of the car! - My leg is stuck!
Maura, go! run!
stay down. Stay down.
go for the tree line. Go! Go!
I got jane's voicemail again. Cell service is iffy, though.
maybe they're yelling so loud, they can't hear their phones.
what is that?
looks like a partial impression of a shut-off valve, a big one.
you only find equipment like this in boiler rooms.
I think your floater was in the tunnels.
where we found rachel's body?
Yeah, I think his head was smashed against a shut-off valve somewhere in the tunnels.
we might be looking at a double homicide.
so, how'd he get in the river?
there's an outflow of the tunnel that dumps right into the charles.
look for a link between rachel lawson and paul mcnamara.
come on. We got to try to keep going. Come on.
we haven't seen them in hours. I need to stop.
okay! - What? What? Did you pull something?
no.
take it off. - All right, all right.
Oh, my god, maura.
your leg, I-it's hard, and it's cold. It's like a dead body. What is that?
it's compartment syndrome. - Well, what does that mean?
the post-tibial artery must have ruptured in the crash.
but you've been walking on it!
blood from the artery is leaking. The pressure built.
and now the blood is trapped in one of the lower compartments of my leg.
okay, bottom line it for me.
the blood supply to my lower leg has been compromised.
I'll lose my leg unless - - unless we get you to a hospital.
Maura, come on! - No, unless you do a fasciotomy.
I need something sharp.
what? No, maura, I
Maura, I'm not gonna cut your leg off with a nail file.
do you have sugar packets? - No, why, did you bring coffee?
I could use it to dress the wound.
do you still have your phone?
Yes. Yes. Why didn't I think of that?
that's luck. We can call 911.
Oh, it's busted!
the touch screen is gorilla glass.
no, maura.
I'm - I'm not gonna do this. - It'll work. Okay.
you're gonna make a six-inch incision right here.
and a five-inch there.
okay, just try not to cut the superficial peroneal nerve.
no. I can't do this. - Take off your shirt.
what? Okay, now I know you've suffered a head injury. And let's go.
to bind the wound. Okay, come on.
Oh, god, maura. Please - Please don't make me do this.
listen to me. Listen to me.
you just keep on cutting, okay, till the blood starts to flow.
Maura, I'm sorry. I can't do this. - You're a sprout trooper! Okay?
just - once you make the double incision, you massage the wound like this.
okay, the blood will be black.
I can't. I can't. I'm so sorry. I can't do this. I'm sorry.
I really like my leg, jane.
please. Come on.
Oh, god.
okay.
okay. - Okay.
all right. All right.
you ready? - Okay.
use more pressure. I'm okay. - You're all right?
I'm not okay!
Rachel was a phd candidate in geology at bcu, mcnamara is a professor of hydrology at waltham university.
too close to be a coincidence.
she didn't take any classes with him. - Nope.
any e-mail correspondence?
no. No phone calls, text messages, nothing.
maybe she watched his "fate of the earth" talk.
searching rachel's browser history.
hold on.
there it is - His "fate of the earth" talk.
so, she knew his work on fracking.
they were talking to each other.
I found a thread in the comments section between mcnamara and "rockrachel.
what's it say?
I have evidence of fracking.
can you meet today in tunnels under geo building?
that's two weeks ago.
looks like they met again...
the day rachel was killed.
meet me. Same place. 3: 00. Bad news.
where the hell is jane?
come on, maura, it's time to wake up.
I dreamt we were camping.
I voted for you.
can you turn the heat down?
come on, we got to get you out of here.
you won sweetest camper again.
I didn't win.
my leg hurts. Why - why does my leg hurt?
sensel matta, I presume?
and you are officer... - Detective rizzoli.
detective?
kind of stupid to drive a car registered to the boston police out to my retreat.
don't you think, detective?
get up. Both of you.
my friend's hurt. She can't move.
get her off the ground.
let's go.
it's all right. It's all right.
what if their car crashed?
try not to worry, ma. I'm sure they're okay.
the state police would have called bpd, Mrs. Rizzoli.
all right, thanks.
that was my contact in army personnel records.
Matthew moore is an ex-army ranger.
he was a blackwater operative, too. - Sounds like one bad ass yogi.
I don't like it. I'm gonna take a ride up there.
take a ride? They could be at any one of those seven lakes.
I got to do something. Jane and Dr. Isles are out there.
how'd you make the transition from yoga to fracking - Hard left at fraud?
this land is full of black gold - all from shale rock.
I just needed capital to tap its potential.
and a religion hide behind?
so you swindled vulnerable college students?
I was already a martial arts master.
didn't take much to repackage what I knew and sell it.
you figured out that rachel was a brilliant geologist, and you brought her here to analyze your rocks for free?
actually, she paid me for the privilege.
she was very obedient.
and she... Helped until she realized that you were destroying this wilderness.
she stole shale samples from me, gave them to an environmental conspiracy crackpot.
I guess you could say we were at cross-purposes.
I'm a homicide detective. Every cop from here to boston will be looking for us.
too bad you can't look behind you.
you'd have a nice view of the water when it comes through.
see, you're in a spillway for one of my reservoirs.
a few million gallons of water's gonna come pouring through here.
it's pretty toxic from all the fracking.
if I were you, I wouldn't drink it.
let's go.
come on!
come on!
try your phone.
I can't, maura.
it's busted, and it got wet.
call your mom.
tell her we're friends again.
okey, okey.
Hey, ma
Oh, crap, it works!
the microprocessor dried. yay!
maybe just texting. Wait.
crap. No. I - I can only send symbols. Son of a...
type 42-point...
okay, thank you, maura.
it's morse code.
nice job, maura.
what the hell?
that view is not okay.
Jane? Maura, you down there?
Korsak?! Down here! Help!
you okay? - Yeah.
we got to get maura out of here, all right?
the spillway to the reservoir is open. Hurry.
did sergeant korsak come on our camping trip?
great job with the morse code.
the coordinates put me almost on top of you.
watch her leg! Watch her leg!
can you walk? - uh, I can hop.
you stayed with her.
I wouldn't leave her.
Frankie, come help! They're back from the hospital!
okay, I got her. - You got her?
all right? - Yeah.
I spoke to korsak. They got sensel matta and his guys.
got her? - Yeah.
are you sure you're okay? - yeah.
let's get her some water. - Thank you.
so, I didn't tell my pop about knowing you-know-who.
I think that's wise.
you think I should tell my ma? - no!
Tommy, did you hurt her? - no.
no, no, he didn't.
my surgeon was very impressed with jane's incisions.
I always wanted a doctor in the family.
well, too bad. You got two cops and... - An undertaker.
no, no, no. No. Not doing that ever again.
I got three great kids.
I think you got a doctor, too.
Thanks.
and thank you for saving my leg, jane.
I think you two should apologize to each other.
butt out. - Butt out.
I'm sorry if you are.
okay, but I'm less sorry.
no, we were both jerks.
you were both assholes.
ma! watch your language!
and...
...I didn't really win "sweetest camper" award.
you didn't?
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
no, no, the insider trading charges were dropped.
very expensive lawyer. - She was a wonderful nanny...
until she was deported.
Whoa!
do you think they're gonna hear us?
only if we keep doing it right.
what?
I forgot to tell you -- You need to speak to Cameron.
she dropped out of school last week.
if we did it like this when we were married, we might still be married.
or just very, very tired.
ceo Reveal Cosmetics
geez.
anybody ever told you about seconds?
Hey, huge, here's a little tip for you
next time, two trips.
think of the second one as cardio.
Hector. - Mr. Brody.
Where's the shrimp?
I'm sorry, Mr. Brody. We're out of shrimps.
what do you mean you're out of the shrimp?
people wait a whole year for this shrimp.
Yes, but -- - no, no, no. What are you telling me?
that the dish I wait 12 months for is no longer available because "the human planet" over there decided to build the Mayan pyramids out of shellfish.
the shrimps -- they're for your wife, Mr. Brody?
can you hook a brother up?
there may be some left in the lower kitchen.
I'll run it down to the pool at once.
you are the man, Hector.
Hey, babe.
your shrimp are on the way.
if you're happy, I'm happy.
founder Alpha Crisis Management
I'm sorry, sweetie, but I told you
after the barbecue I need to get right to the office.
no, it's a crisis.
distribution mixed up our shipments of Viagra and chewable vitamins.
Yeah, boys all through the Midwest are getting...
spontaneous erections.
so, don't wait up, okay?
french toast for breakfast sounds great.
of course I love your french toast.
you know I'm always honest with you.
okay, bye.
God, this is the first and last time I'm having an affair.
ceo Devotion Pharmaceuticals
your wife's a very lucky woman, sir.
thanks for meeting me. - My pleasure.
so, tell me
since my Christmas bonus.
thank you for that, by the way
I hope it won't be awkward running into eh other here.
why would it be awkward?
we see each other at the office every day.
because I'm letting you go.
what? And the board?
the board doesn't know yet. Nobody does.
but when I present my reorganization plan tomorrow, they won't have any choice.
you'll land on your feet, James.
that's why I hired you in the first place.
Oh...
since you're new here, make sure you try the shrimp.
it's one of life's true pleasures.
golden Boy Amerimart Industries
soon-to-be-former Golden Boy Amerimart Industries
there you are.
Hey.
Hey, the kids were looking for you.
come here.
it's good to see you.
everything okay? - Yeah, yeah.
what did he want?
Oh, you know, just -- just work stuff.
work stuff? Today?
Yeah, you know, quarterly reports.
s. E.C. Poking around. The usual.
listen, I'm gonna go find the guys.
I'll meet you and the kids for s'mores later, okay?
okay. - Okay.
that dress still kills me, you know.
Rapido! Rapido! Where's the shrimp?!
Rapido! Es para la esposa de Mr. Brody!
he fired you?
no one knows yet. It won't be official till tomorrow.
he's threatened by you. It's obvious.
you're younger, better-looking, and, worst of all, you got a hotter wife.
Hey, absolutely -- hot-wife envy.
every time Mrs. C.E.O. Stepped out of that show, you were one step closer to the unemployment line.
things change.
when Lisbeth and I were married, she couldn't have been less interested in sex.
but now that we're both single again -- mmm, mommy.
can't keep our hands off each other.
maybe you should remarry her.
Yeah, right.
then sex in the wine cellar becomes "don't touch me. I'm exfoliating.
and what's wrong with you? He feels guilty.
that's right.
because I'm cheating on the saint who plans my breakfasts in advance.
well, it could be worse.
you could be spending your days begging grown men for shellfish.
Hey! Rapido!
that can't be good.
help!
my boss. - My shrimp!
what happened?
I took a shortcut to keep the shrimps cold.
he came out of nowhere. - Call 911.
I'm sure he'll be fine.
you can forget 911.
I think things are suddenly looking up for you, huh, James?
hell of a barbecue.
good morning, sir.
good morning, Susan. - Mr. Walker.
death by golf cart.
I thought the old man was gonna outlive us all.
well, make yourself at home, by the way.
Hey, I'm an exec V. P. Too.
how come I don't get a swivel chair in my office?
probably 'cause the company finds me more valuable than you.
come on. We're late for our friends upstairs.
rumor is that the frontrunner for the C. E.O. job is that jerk from G. E. That hit on me at the sun valley conference.
wait a minute. Didn't you sleep with that guy?
I said he was a jerk, not that he wasn't hot.
I mean, I must sound like a cliche but...
sometimes I wonder if Karl is seeing someone else.
are you, Karl? - Yes.
my staff of 1, 200 employees who count on me each and every day.
and we barely do anything together anymore.
last week I asked Karl to go to the movies
to see "the nanny diaries."
he said he had to work. On a Sunday.
I run a billion-dollar pharmaceutical conglomerate.
people need antidepressants on the weekends, too.
sometimes I just wish he could look at me like he used to.
Karl, as a gesture to Wendy, could you find the time to take her to the movies?
I think this would be a small but important step in repairing this marriage. Marla: I miss your penis.
Karl, could you?
Karl! - Yes. Sorry.
I forgot to switch off my penis -- I mean phone.
no significant accomplishments?
you're being too modest.
you've branded reveal as the industry leader in personal grooming.
Oh, that.
and I'll be honest
I won't leave the house without first applying your toner and blush.
well, I'll be honest
it's working.
that should about do it.
if all goes well, you'll be entrepreneur's cover boy in November.
but I do have one last question.
I'm an open book.
do you spend much time in Yonkers?
YONKERS?
I don't understand. - You see, there are rumors
rumors that might interest your shareholders.
and what kind of journalist would I be if I didn't ask?
I can assure you I haven't been to Yonkers in...
20 years. - That's what I thought.
in any case, since your profile doesn't go to press for another six weeks,
I'll have plenty of time to look into those rumors.
good day, Duncan.
sorry.
what end of the club are you using, man?
sorry, sorry. My instructor says sometimes I break my wrist too soon.
no, Tiger Woods sometimes breaks his wrist too soon.
you just suck.
so, not only am I still employed, they've decided to promote from within.
they're interviewing every upper-level exec for the C. E.O.'S job, including myself.
well, enough about you.
I got real problems.
lady Macbeth wants me to throw her a birthday party at the club next week.
so?
she wants me to plan it to show how much I care about her.
I said, "sweetheart, I did not go to harvard business school to study party planning."
you said that? - No.
that woman tolerates no dissent.
it's like being married to Dick Cheney.
you're late. - I got trouble.
wait, I thought you said you were arrested for a D.W.I.
no, no. That was just my cover for why I needed bail money.
you lied to us.
Karl, we're men.
when it comes to sex, money, or a criminal proceeding, we're allowed to lie.
so, what happened in Yonkers?
I was coming home from a hunting trip.
you don't hunt. - Fine. I was antiquing.
can we just stick to the subject here?
I was getting tired, so I pulled into a truck stop for some coffee to keep me awake for the drive home.
there was a woman there.
dark, beautiful, sexy as hell.
she smiled at me, and we began to talk a little.
don't tell me -- she was a pro.
I was lonely.
one thing led to another, and before I knew it, we we in the men's-room stall for a little business transaction.
why do I feel dirty?
but in the midst of our transaction...
a state trooper stumbled in.
arrested us both.
so, you got pinched for solicitation?
it's not something you want on the resume - but it could have been a lot worse. - Let me finish.
this dark, beautiful woman
well, she was full of surprises.
unfortunately...
her penis was one of them.
you got a knobbier from a tranny?
how do you think I felt? Every inch of her was woman.
she looked like a model.
unfortunately, she was modeling penises.
that's very supportive.
it's just personal preference. When it comes to women, I'm not a penis man.
guys, let's just focus for a second.
if this journalist gets corroboration, it could cost Duncan his job.
you've come to the right guy. This is what crisis management is all about.
first year of law school
if there's no corroborating witness, then it's all hearsay...
until they get ahold of the tranny.
exactly.
you just got to find a way to keep her
or him -- quiet, and you're home free.
the reporter cannot touch you.
track down the tranny.
track down the tranny.
you all right?
this is the place I reserved for Janelle's party this weekend.
if she smells formaldehyde, I'm a dead man.
Mrs. Storrs, I'm James Walker from Amerimart.
I'm very sorry for your loss. - That makes one of us.
uh, I believe this belongs to you. It was left behind at the scene.
apparently my husband found someone more deserving than me.
excuse me.
Hey. - Hey.
but the necklace -- not for the loyal wife.
for the other woman.
probably gave it to her before he died.
son of a bitch. - I know.
guy's worth $40 million and not even a sniff in my direction.
is she okay?
Yeah. You know Stacey. She takes things hard.
when our Springer Spaniel died, she was a mess for...
are you okay?
James? You all right?
Hey, James.
nice wake.
but let's be honest
cash bar? Oh, tacky.
you okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
just got a call from an old friend of mine.
he thinks his wife might be having an affair.
rite of passage for men.
loss of virginity. First threesome.
discovery of the cheating wife.
the trifecta.
you, too? - My second wife, after Lisbeth.
of course, I encouraged her to do it. Spice things up a little.
your friend -- how's he doing?
just trying to breathe.
well, I better run.
I'm off to break bread with a woman who hates me.
your ex? - No, my daughter.
vodka tonic.
that's your third, you know.
I didn't know you were keeping score.
I didn't know you had to get loaded to face your daughter.
you should try facing her. You'd get loaded, too.
look, I appreciate the Cobb salad, Duncan, but I told you
I'm not going back to school.
I mean, your life turned out fine without a degree.
professionally, at least.
dad, okay? Call me "dad," please.
dad was the guy who raised me since I was 8 and died of a stroke last year.
you're biology, Duncan. That's it.
and you don't need to worry about me, okay?
I'll find a decent job. - Really?
what's the market out there for overentitled 19-year-olds with smart mouths?
you know, this has been fun...
in a really not-fun kind of way.
do me a favor. The next time you want to pass judgment, send an e-mail.
so you can reduce me to dna?
God forbid I should open my mouth to you.
sit down.
whatever you think of me, I'm still your father.
fine.
you want to act like my father?
step up to the plate. Prove it.
how?
give me a job.
I -- I think I should get you in touch with my trademarks department.
there are some things you just did we might want to get a patent on.
I'm glad I make you happy.
you deserve it.
can I ask you a question, Karl?
you and your wife...
do you still sleep together?
no. No, I told you -- not in months.
to be honest -- ooh!
after being with you,
I'm not even sure we were doing it right to begin with.
but you still do other things with her, right?
and I love you so much, I want to do those things with you, too.
to tell you the truth, the only thing we do together anymore is couples therapy two mornings a week.
couples therapy? - Yeah.
then that's what I want to do with you.
but... we're not even married.
plus we get along great.
we don't need couples therapy.
Oh. I see how this works.
I do things to you that you've fantasized about since junior high school, but the second I ask for one tiny thing...
let me ask you
how are you gonna like having to call your wife the next time you feel horny, Karl?
I'm not afraid of the hard work, doctor.
uh, Mr. Mixworthy? - Yeah?
a word.
this is highly unorthodox. - Look at her, doctor.
she's an interior designer by trade, but you know what her real skill is?
making a short, insecure, lactose-intolerant man feel like a porn star.
that's very touching -- - I'll double your fee.
done. My contractor's bleeding me dry.
no. No, sweetie.
it's no problem.
okay. I love you, too.
Bye, hon.
I have an MBA, I drive an S-class, and I run a 6-minute mile.
and you know how she judges me as a man?
if I can get her favorite dessert here from a little cafe on the left bank in time for her party this weekend.
till death do you part.
sometimes it just sounds like a threat, doesn't it?
how am I gonna get 500 Napoleons here by this Saturday?
this is it.
classy spot.
Oh, yeah.
I can see how the vending machines would really put a guy in the mood.
so, is she gonna be here?
she told me this was her regular spot and her pimp just promoted he she got promoted to this?
boy, she must have kicked ass at the slaughterhouse.
by the way, you never told me her name.
you hooked up with someone named Dontrelle and for a second didn't think that might be a dude?
that sounds like the middle linebacker.
I told you it was dark.
cause Dontrelle went 6'4," 320, and blocked out the sun.
hold on. Hold on.
there's someone.
Hey. - Hey, yourself.
you boys looking for a good time?
no. I'm married.
I'm done with good times.
actually, we're looking for Dontrelle.
Dontrelle don't work exit 47 no more.
another promotion, perhaps.
do you know where I could find him -- uh, her?
sorry. Can't help you.
I might be able to track Dontrelle down through this old John I know.
tell her to call me at this number, and tell her it's really, really important.
she was that good, huh?
let's just say when it comes to sex...
she's the man.
Hey.
kids are asleep. Florie said that they were angels.
well, you know, I'm kind of tired.
so I think I'm gonna go up, too, okay?
first time I saw you -- freshman year at Madison, econ 101.
Yeah. What's this about?
you walked in.
I was already there, of course, because
I was 15 minutes early everywhere freshman year.
and I thought to myself, "if I could just sit across from that girl and have a cup of coffee, my life would be perfect."
well, you got more than a cup of coffee.
I know.
but my life isn't perfect.
Hey, what's wrong? What
what's going on? Are you nervous about the interview tomorrow?
no, I was just thinking about that first time I saw you and wondering if my boss felt the same way the first time he saw you.
wh-- what are you talking about?
you were sleeping with him.
the necklace you had yesterday -- he gave it to you before he died, didn't he?
don't talk to me like you love me. Just answer me.
I do love you. - Answer me.
were you having an affair with him?
and I'll respect you a hell of a lot more if you tell me the truth.
Yes.
Yes. At least you can't say I'm a liar.
no, I am.
because I don't respect you one bit.
James, James, wait. Let's talk about this.
don't walk out on me. - I may be leaving...
but I'm not the one who walked out.
James, wait!
James, don't go!
market share is up.
the fall campaign has cemented our brand recognition.
we are the darlings of wall street.
sir, aren't you worried about hurting someone?
nonsense.
Adam has it taken care of.
Hey, moron!
sorry! Sorry.
even in success, Reveal must be a leader, not a follower.
you know by the year 2015, the most rapidly expanding population group will be women over 60?
why not make them feel beautiful, too?
why shouldn't women in nursing homes have access to the best foundation and base available?
why not market a line of hair products specifically for wigs?
Really? Cause, actually...
the way to reach seniors is to appeal to the girl in them, - not the old woman. - Excuse me?
come on, Duncan. Everybody knows women don't like to think of themselves as old.
the exception being your last three teenage girlfriends, of course.
I give you a job, I give you responsibility.
Yeah, to get non-fat lattes. - That's not the point.
do you know what a 19-year-old girl would do for an opportunity like this?
no, but I have a feeling you do.
do you want this job, Cam?
Yeah. - Then you need to zip it...
and prove that you belong here.
how?
you'll see.
I want this place in shape by Monday morning or
or what?
I guess you'll find that out Monday morning.
beautiful.
I need to end it... with Marla.
we have nothing in common.
the only books she reads are about the differences between good carbs and bad.
so end it. What's the problem?
how do you break up with a woman who wears underwear like this?
Mr. Walker? They're ready for you now.
has led us to search for his successor.
do you find tragic deaths amusing, Mr. Walker?
no, not usually. But this one -- maybe a little bit.
thank you for your time, Mr. Walker, but we have other candidates waiting.
serious candidates. - Done already, huh?
okay.
I guess I'm not
just -- just one thing.
this company is in trouble, and Walter Storrs knew that when he died.
Amerimart has been an industry leer for nearly half a century.
Hey, look, you might not think that Amerimart will ever falter.
I'm here to tell you that one day you might wake up and realize that while you slept, the ground shifted, and everything you thought was so firm and so solid
guess what -- it's not anymore.
the world is changing so much faster than we are, ladies and gentlemen.
right now, somewhere in a garage, two kids are inventing something that's gonna put us out of business one day.
we shouldn't be ignoring these kids. We should be hiring them.
because you know what they'll call us if we don't?
available office space.
now, I'm sure your dream candidates all have perfect resume, unblemished lives, and have succeeded at everything they've ever done.
but if I were you,
I'd hire someone who knows what it feels like to lose something, because he will never let that happen again.
and now I'll let you get back to your serious candidates.
I wish I hadn't eaten all that bread at lunch.
nothing worse than bad carbs.
if I may...
we've had quite an adventure, you and I, but like every great adventure, - there comes a time when you -- - damn.
I forgot to go to a cash machine.
can you lend me $20 for a cab?
pants pocket.
like I was saying, everything has its time and place, - but ultimately, you discover -- - you saw "the nanny diaries"?
Wendy was dying to see it.
but you said -- hmm.
you said you don't spend time together anymore.
we don't. The couples' therapist thought it would be a good idea.
but back to what I was trying to establish
don't I feel like a fool!
you had me convinced that you and your wife were practically strangers!
we are!
well, I don't go to the movies with strangers, Karl. Do you?
I mean, what kind of man would be so deceitful as to lie to the woman he's cheating on his wife with?
I bet Wendy would like to know what her loving husband is up to when he's not at home.
what are you saying?
you're gonna tell her about us?
not everything.
just the part about the sex and the hotel rooms.
Marla, wait.
cupcake!
sweetheart!
Marla, hey!
Marla, wait!
Marla! Let's discuss this in couples therapy!
come on, Karl. The mistress never tells.
just buy her something nice, like some jewelry or a low-carb bar.
I was seconds from ending it, and now...
I mean, Wendy and I may have grown apart lately, but the thought of losing her...
you know what's so funny? You're so worried about losing her.
what makes you think you haven't lost her already?
what's he talking about?
how do you know she's not spending her afternoons in a hotel room, too, lying in bed with your contractor, having the same conversations about you?
Wendy hates our contractor. He was completely unreliable.
what's wrong, James?
Stacey was having an affair with my boss.
I don't know what to say. - Well, I do.
that sucks.
I'd offer to take him out myself if Hector hadn't already done it for us.
okay. All this genuine emotion is making me a little uneasy.
that's it.
look at us.
I mean, we're supposed to be these alpha males, right?
but now James' wife is sleeping around on him, Karl can't control his crazy mistress, and I'm so whipped, I can't tell my wife that the delivery company can't seem to find her shipment of Napoleons.
men...
we're the new women.
what fresh hell?
give me good news.
what do you mean they're in Tampa?
well, how does that help me?
guys, I have pastry issues. I'll see you guys later.
what do you mean the cream filling won't clear customs?
it's a dessert, not an explosive.
I always said Brody had a real Napoleon complex.
Yeah, I should go, too.
see if Wendy's had the accounts frozen.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Me, too.
thank you.
keep the change.
Hi. Can I help you?
actually...
maybe I can help you.
you say you first met him a month ago?
I can't believe you.
to keep this from me -- all I can say is I'm shocked.
right. About that
why didn't you tell me you hired a decorator?
Marla and I were just discussing ideas for the guesthouse.
Oh. Good. The guesthouse.
it's so unlike Karl to take an interest in decorating.
Oh, isn't it amazing to be married to a man for all these years and not have the faintest idea who he is?
Duncan, what are you doing here?
my date is gonna be here any minute.
I need to talk to you about Cameron. She's headstrong, belligerent.
you can't tell her anything she doesn't already know.
you should be happy -- proof that she's yours.
vodka tonic. - To go.
I just don't think it's gonna work out with Cam.
well, she'll be disappointed, but it won't be the first time.
what's that supposed to mean?
she's angry at you, Duncan
not that she can admit it, but she is.
angry? I've given her everything she ever asked for.
but did you ever notice that after she turned 12, she stopped asking?
look, you may not have been the greatest father to date, but you're a good man.
and the best thing about being a father
every day is a chance to do better.
prettier.
you never stopped long enough to notice.
your date -- if it gets serious, no more wine cellars for us.
that's right, Duncan.
so I don't have to obsess.
you know, if we ever did get back together, you'd lose interest in me completely.
try me. - Maybe.
just not tonight.
what the hell's going on?
I didn't tell her about us, if that's what you mean.
then what are you doing here?
well, I came here to tell her, but then I realized Wendy's not the one I want to hurt.
and then we got to talking, and you know what?
we kind of hit it off.
you -- you hit it off with my wife?
she's smart and sweet and so funny.
funny? Wendy's funny?
Karl, how you can not appreciate her is beyond me.
she's a gem. I have half a mind to fix her up with my trainer.
here you go, hon. Sorry if it's a little strong.
perfect. I just need a couple more.
I never liked her, you know.
even when I said I did, I didn't.
but, of course, if you decide to take her back, I'll deny ever saying that.
who told you?
not you.
I had to find out the old-fashioned way.
Ah, office gossip.
well, what are they saying?
the men hate her, and the women are trying to figure out when you'll be ready to date.
you know, the heart is a complex little muscle.
but you're a great guy, and there are a lot of women out there that can see that, even if your wife can't.
you sure you're?
they called.
before you came in.
who called?
the board.
I've just been named C.E.O. of Amerimart.
you're kidding. - No.
they said they wanted new blood, new direction.
you're not kidding.
congratulations, James.
Thanks.
guess I'd better go. I'm late for a conference call.
don't want to get off on the wrong foot with the new boss.
these women that think I'm such a good guy
do I know any of them?
just the one that's gonna take your job if you screw it up.
Bye, boss.
can I help you?
I'm looking for Duncan Collinsworth. Do you know him?
as a matter of fact, I do.
unbelievable.
my wife finally makes a friend, and it's my mistress.
what are the odds?
well, at least you have something to talk about in couples' therapy.
Oh...
Hi! - Boy.
Duncan, there's someone I think you'd like to speak with.
Hi, sweetie.
just smile.
Hey, Janelle's thrilled.
she's having a great time.
this makes you happy, doesn't it?
Yeah, I know I bitch.
but, you know, she's got this other side, and I know you don't see it.
I don't see it as much as I should. But...
we just fit, you know?
Yeah, I know.
I see the Napoleons made it?
Nope, theye in Tampa.
found a little place in New Jersey -- boom. Knocked them out in two hours.
Janelle never knew the difference. - Nice.
so, remember...
if that reporter asks any questions, you never met me.
for a grand, I can forget almost anything.
perfect.
am I gonna be invited back? - Oh, absolutely.
guys.
this is Dontrelle.
Dontrelle, the guys. - They're cute.
they know you're packing. - Worth a shot.
come on.
Bye.
Wow.
I'm not asking you not to be angry at me, okay?
then what are you asking me?
if you're ever gonna be able to stop.
when I was promoted yesterday, you know what I thought?
I thought how I wished I could call you just to hear your voice.
and at the company dinner, how you should have been right beside me, wearing your little black dress.
that was the day I'd been dreaming of since business school, and all I could think of was what I'd lost.
it doesn't have to be that way, James. Why don't you just come home?
no. I can't.
C.E.O. of Amerimart.
world's most eligible bachelor, huh?
that's not what I wanted for myself.
not since econ01.
Bye. Bye-bye, sweetie.
good night. - Bye.
you and Dontrelle are not just old squash partners, right?
don't tell your mom, okay?
you know, Duncan, we're more alike than I thought.
we both have trouble getting out of our own ways.
are you gonna stop embarrassing me at work?
probably not.
are you gonna stop judging me? - Not likely.
at least we know where we stand.
good night, Duncan.
I'll see you Monday. - Hey...
you can call me "dad," you know.
I know.
good night, Duncan.
baby steps.
all right, ladies, my turn.
a toast to my new best friend Marla.
one. Just one for me.
the one over there with the cute little forked
what are you guys talking about?
the number of women in our lives that drive us absolutely crazy.
two for me.
God help me.
I'm with Brody.
one.
Yeah.
ask him again in six months.
what about you, Dunc?
2 1/2. - 2 1/2?
there's Lisbeth, obviously.
cameron, of course.
and I think Dontrelle's worth a half, don't you?
to Dontrelle.
he seemed like such a nice guy.
I don't know why you needed me to tape him.
because a thousand words paint a very nice picture.
great party.
16-piece band.
Janelle said it was the best birthday she has ever had.
gentlemen, I may actually have a shot with my own wife tonight.
just in case, I still have Dontrelle's number.
e-mail me.
now there's the Batman.
Oh? You wanna play, come on!
come on!
he missed!
you can't stop here, we're like sitting ducks!
come on, come on, come on...
come on, come on, I want you to do it, I want you to do it, come on!
come on, come on! I want you to do it! I want you to do it, Come on, hit me, hit me!
come on, hit me!!! -- Argh!!!!!!!
hit me!!!
could you please just give me a minute?
we got you, you son-of-the-bitch!
Gordon!
you do like to do things pretty close to the chest. -- We got him, Harvey.
Mr. Dent, Mr. Dent, how does it feel to be the biggest hero in Gotham?
no, I am no hero. Gotham's finest, they are the heroes.
did you and your office have been working with the Batman all alone? -- No, but I trusted him to do the right thing.
such as? -- Saving my ass.
all right people, that's enough. Let him be, let him be! -- Thank you, Detective.
I've got a date with a pretty upset girlfriend. -- Thank you, counselor.
stand away! All of you!
I don't want anything for his mob lawyer to use, you understand?
back from the dead?
couldn't risk my family's safety.
what we got?
nothing. No matches on prints, DNA,dental...clothing is custom no labels.
nothing in his pockets but knifes and lint.
no name, no other alias. -- Go home, Gordon.
that clown we'll keep till morning, go get some rest, you gonna need it.
tomorrow, you take the big job.
you don't have any say in the matter, Commissioner Gordon.
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety
what's up fat bastard? -- I don't feel good.
you're a cop killer, you're lucky to be feeling anything below the neck!
Please!!! -- Step away from the bars. -- My insides hurt.
did Batman save you, Daddy?
actually this time...I saved him.
has he said anything yet?
evening ...erm..."commissioner."
Harvey Dent never made it home. -- Of course not.
what did you done with him? -- Me?
I was right here.
who do you leave him with? Hmm?
your people?
assuming of course, they are still "your" people, and not Maroni's.
does it depress you? Commissioner
to know, just how alone you really are?
does it make you feel responsible for Harvey Dent's current predicament? -- Where is he?
what's the time? -- What difference does that make?
depending on the time, he maybe in one spot, or several.
if we are going to play games
I'm gotta need a cup of coffee.
Ah, the good cop, bad cop routine?
not exactly.
never start with the head, the victim get all fuzzy, he can't feel the next
see? -- You wanted me, here I am.
I wanted to see what you'd do.
and you didn't disappoint me.
you let five people die.
then, you let Dent take your place.
even to a guy like me, that's cold. -- Where is Dent?
those Mob fools want you gone, so they can get back to the way things were.
but I know the truth, there's no going back.
you've changed things...Forever. -- Then why do you want to kill me?
I don't want to kill you. What would I do without you?
go back to a rip 'em off mob dealers? No, no.
no, no. You...you complete me.
you're garbage, you kill for money. -- Don't talk like one of them. You are not!
even if you'd like to be.
to them, you're just a freak...like me!
they need you right now.
when they don't, they will cast you out like a leper. See their morals, their code
it's a bad joke.
dropped at the first sign of trouble.
they're only as good as the World allows them to be.
I'll show you, when the chips are down
these...err...these civilized people, they'll eat each other.
see, I'm not a monster.
I'm just ahead of the curve.
where is Dent? -- Have all these rules, you think they'll save you?
he's in control. -- I have one rule.
Oh, then that's the rule you'll have to break to know the truth. -- Which is?
the only sensible way to live in this world is without rules.
and tonight, you're going to break your one rule. -- I'm considering it.
you know there's only minutes left, you're gonna have to play my little game, if you want to save one of them.
them? -- When I threw her out there
I thought you really were Dent. The way you threw yourself after her.
look at you go.
does Harvey know about you and his little bunny
where are they? -- Killing is maybe a choice.
where are they? -- Choose between one life or the other.
your friend, District Attorney or his blushing bride-to-be.
you have nothing, nothing to threaten me.
nothing to deal with all your strength.
don't worry! I'm gonna tell you where they are!
both of them, and that's the point.
you'll have to choose...he's at 250-52 streets and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.
which one are you going after? -- Rachel!
we're going to get Dent!
250-52. Street!
Hello?
anybody hear me?
Hello?
Rachel? -- Harvey.
Oh Harvey, thank God! Are you OK?
I'm alright, I'm in a...I'm in a warehouse, they got me wired to these oil drums.
I am too... Harvey ...
I want...my phone call.
what. -- I wanna...I want my phone call.
that's nice.
how many of your friends have I killed?
I 'm a 20 year man, and I know the difference between punks and the illness reside manners
and a freak like you, would just enjoy it.
you killed 6 of my friends. -- 6?
please, my insides hurt. -- I don't really care, back away!
boss said that he'd make the voices go away.
he said he'd go inside and replace them with bright lights
like Christmas! -- You're out of your mind pal, back off!
medic make way to the holding tank! Come on. Get the door open! -- You guys back off!
listen. We don't have a lot of time.
he told me that only one of us is gonna make it
and that they're gonna let our friends choose.
OK, Rachel
it's gonna be fine, it's gonna be alright, they're coming for you.
OK, listen to me, I'll help you, just talk me. Talk me through what's going on with you.
can you find something, anything sharp? -- I'm trying.
what? Harvey?
Harvey, what's happening?
all available units converge to 250-52 street.
do you want to know...why I use a knife?
guns are too quick, you can't savor all the little emotions.
you ...you see, in their last moments
people show you who they really are.
so in a way, I know you friends better than you ever did!
would you like to know which of them are cowards?
what's that? -- Jesus!
he's got some kind of...contusion.
I know you're gonna enjoy this.
I'm gonna have to try enjoy it, even more.
let him go! -- Drop the weapon now!
just shoot him! -- Let him go now! Drop the weapon on floor now!
what do you want?
I just want my phone call.
what...What...What's happening?
just talk to me for just one second.
alright. -- Come here.
is that a ... Phone?
move the car!!!
Harvey, just in case...I wanna tell you something, OK?
don't think like that, Rachel, they're coming for you. -- I know they are, but I don't want them to.
I don't want to live without you and I do have an answer for you.
my answer is yes.
No! No! No, Not me!
Why're you coming to me? No!
Rachel! Rachel!
Harvey ...
OK. -- Rachel!
Harvey, it's ok. It's alright. Listen, some
No! -- Rachel!
hello there.
back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.
with Lau?
the Joker plan to be caught.
he wanted me to lock him up in the MCU.
dear Bruce.
I need to be honest and clear.
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.
I love him and I wanna spend the rest of my life with him.
when I told you that if Gotham no longer needed Batman
we could be together, I meant it.
but now I'm sure that the day won't come when you no longer need Batman.
I hope it does.
and if it does, I will be there
but as your friend.
I'm sorry, Harvey.
I'm sorry to let you down
if you lose your faith in me, please keep your faith in people
love, now and always. Rachel.
I prepared a little breakfast.
very well then. -- Alfred.
Yes, Master Wayne?
did I bring this on her?
I was meant to inspire good, not madness, not death
you have inspired good, but you spat in faces of Gotham's criminals
didn't you think there might be some casualties?
things are always gonna get worse before they got better.
but Rachel, Alfred? -- Rachel believed in what you stood for.
what we stand for. Gotham needs you.
no, Gotham needs its true hero
and I let that murderer, sycophancy blow him half to hell.
which is why, for now you gonna have to make do with you.
she was gonna wait for me, Alfred.
dent doesn't know, he can never know.
what's that? -- It can wait.
that bandit, in the forest in Burma
did you catch him? -- Yes.
how? -- We burned the forest down.
he's a credible source and M. N.A. lawyer for the prestigious counsultancy.
he said he's waited as long as he can for the Batman to do the right thing.
and now he's taking matters into his own hands.
we'll be live at 5 with the true identity of the Batman.
I am sorry about Rachel.
the doctor says you are in agonizing pain, but you won't accept medication
that you're refusing to accept skin grafts
remember that name you all had for me when I was at Internal Affairs
what was it, Gordon? -- Harvey ...
say it...
say it!
two Face...Harvey Two Face ...
why should I hide who I am?
I know you try to warn me. I am sorry.
Wuertz picked you up, is he working for them?
do you know who picked up Rachel?
Harvey, I need to know which of my men I could trust.
why would you listen to me now?
I am sorry, Harvey.
no, no you're not.
not yet.
this craziness ...it's too much...
you should have thought about that before you and the clown out of the box.
you want him?
I can tell you where he'll be this afternoon.
not so crazy as you look! -- I told you, I'm a man of my word.
Where's the Italian?
all tactical units will converge on the location in 20 minutes.
I want auxiliary units to cover all possible get away routes.
wait! Joker man, what you do with all your money?
you see, I'm a guy with simple taste.
I enjoy err...Dynamite,Gunpowder and Gasoline!
what the ...
and you know the thing that they have in common?
they are Cheap.
I want to know how much they are paying you to say who Batman really is
this is our chance! I want Lau alive, the Joker...either way.
hey Jim, get a look at this! -- Let's take the next caller.
Harvey Dent didn't want to give in to this maniac. You think you're better than him?
I think that if we could talk to Dent today, he may feel differently.
and we wish him a speedy recovery... God knows, we need him now.
you said you were a man of your word. -- Oh, I am.
I'm only burning my half.
all you care about is money.
this town deserves a better class criminal.
I'm gonna give it to them.
tell your men they work for me now. This is my city.
they won't work for a freak! -- A Freak?
why don't we cut you up into little pieces and feed you to your pooches, hmm?
and then we'll see how loyal a hungry dog really is!
it's not about money...it's about sending a message...
everything burns.
who is this? -- I had a vision of a world without Batman.
the Mob ground down a little profit, and the police tried to shut them down, one block at a time
and it was so...boring. I'd have a change of heart.
I don't want Mr. Reese spoiling everything but why should I have all the fun?
let's give someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese
isn't dead in 60 minutes, then I'll blow up a hospital.
I want you to call every officer, tell them to head their nearest hospital start evac and search!
call the transit authorities, school board, prisons... Get every available bus down to a hospital!
the priority, is Gotham General!
wheel everybody out of that place right now! You, you and you, you come with me.
where are we going, Sir? -- To get Reese.
I need you plugged in, checking Gordon's men and their families.
looking for? -- Hospital Admissions.
will you be wanting the Bat Pod, Sir? -- In the middle of day, Alfred?
not very subtle. -- The Lamborghini then.
much more subtle.
excuse me, let me through. Excuse me, ok.
sir, could you help, please?
I'll go find a bus for him.
sir, Commissioner, do you really think ordinary citizen will try to kill this man?
get the cars around back!
go, keep walking.
I see O'Brian, Richards...
no immediate family member admited to a Gotham Hospital.
they are trying to kill me. -- Oh, maybe Batman can save you.
Davis, I've got space. Bring him out.
Davis!
I saw Burnes and Zachary?
nothing on them. -- And a patrolman I don't know.
so what now? What do we do now? Where are we going?
send the information to Gordon.
get out of here.
Davis!
ma'am, we gonna have to move him now.
it's Berg, is it? -- Commissioner.
you OK, son?
Hah...Hi.
you know ...
I don't want there to be any hard feelings between us, Harvey.
when you and err ... -- Rachel!
Rachel were being abducted, I was sitting in Gordon's cage.
I ... I didn't rig those charges. -- Your man, your plan.
do I really look like a guy with a plan?
you know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars.
I won't know what to do, even if I caught it.
you know I just "do" things.
the Mob has plans, the cops have plans, Gordon got plans
you know, they are schemers.
schemers trying to control their little worlds.
I'm not a schemer. I try to show the schemers
how pathetic, their attempts to control things really are.
so when I say ... uh, come here.
when I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal
you know that I'm telling the truth.
I'm gonna need your weapon. -- What?
why, because my wife's in the hospital? -- Yeah, that'll be why.
it's the schemers, that put you where you are.
you were a schemer, you had plans
And...look where it got you
the police force are taking every possible precaution urging everyone not to take matters into their own hands.
I just did what I do best
I took your little plan and I turn it on itself
look what I did, to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets?
know what? You know what I noticed?
nobody panics when things go according to plan.
even if the plan is horrifying.
if tomorrow I tell the press that like a gangbanger will get shot
or a truck load of soldiers will be blowing up
nobody panics, because it's all part of the plan.
but when I say that one, little old Mayor will die
well then everyone loses their minds!
introduce a little anarchy.
upset the established order
and everything becomes ... Chaos.
I'm an agent of Chaos.
Oh and you know the thing about Chaos?
it's fair.
you live. -- Mm hmm?
you die!
now we're talking.
Mr. Reese?
it's Mr. Wayne, huh? That's a very brave thing you did.
trying to catch the light? -- Were you...you weren't protecting the van?
Why? Who's in it?
well, you think I should go to the hospital? -- You don't watch a whole lot of news do you, Mr. Wayne?
south East... its Gotham General.
did you clear the building? -- Yeah.
we must know how they were inside, you've got patients with roll calls!
sir, right now we're showing 50 people missing, one bus.
are these all the buses we're heading off to other hospitals?
my guess is, we missed one. -- Yeah? Well where your guess about Harvey Dent is?
keep looking! And keep it to yourself! Anybody ask, we got him out!
get me the Mayor Office on the line, we gonna need a national guard.
people are still missing, including GCN's own, Mike Engel
I'm now being told that we're cutting to a video GCN has just received.
I am Mike Engel, for Gotham Tonight. What is it take to make you people want to join in?
you fail to kill the lawyer. I've gotta get you off the bench and into the game.
come nightfall, the city is mine.
and anyone left here plays by my rule.
Mr. Fox, security has showing up break in at the R&D Department.
if you don't wanna be in the game, get out now.
but the bridge and tunnel crowd are sure for surprise. Haha Haha
sweet Jesus.
shouldn't you be out there... You know, doing something?
it's my day off.
I gotta take a leak. Keep an eye up for me, will you?
now what? You need someone to shake it for ya? -- Hello!
Dent? Jesus, I thought you was dead! -- Half.
who picked up Rachel, Wuertz? -- Must be Maroni's men.
shut up!
are you telling me that you're gonna protect the other traitor in Gordon's unit?
I don't know! He never told me! Listen Dent
I swear to God, I didn't know what they were gonna do to you!
that's funny, because I don't know what's gonna happen to you either.
beautiful, isn't it?
beautiful, unethical, dangerous.
you've turn every cell phone in Gotham into a microphone.
and high frequency generator receiver.
you took my sonar concept, and applied it to every phone in the city!
with half the city feeding you sonar, you can image all of Gotham.
this is wrong. -- I've got to find this man, Lucius.
at what cost? -- The database is null-key encrypted.
it can be only access by one person. -- There is too much power for one person.
that's why I gave it to you, only you can use it.
spying on 30 million people isn't part of my job description.
this is an audio sample. If he talks within range of any phone in the city
you can triangulate his position. -- I'll help you this one time
but consider this my resignation. As long as this machine is at Wayne Enterprises
I won't be. -- When you finish
type in your name.
my officers are going over every inch of the tunnels and bridges. But with the Joker's threat -- They're not an option. -- Land route east?
backed up for hours. Which leaves the ferries with 30 thousand, ready to board.
plus I'm gonna use the ferry so I can get some of those prisoners off the island.
the men you intend put away, those are people I'm worried about. -- You should be.
whatever the Joker's planning, its a good bet that Harvey's prisoners might be involved.
I want to get them out of here.
so where is Harvey? -- We haven't found him.
Oh Jesus.
how long can you keep this quiet?
don't stop for lights, cops, nothing!
going to join your wife?
you love her? -- Yes.
you ever imagine what it'd be like to listen her die?
look, take it up with the Joker. He killed your woman.
he made you ... like this. -- The Joker's just a mad dog.
I want whoever let him off the leash.
I took care of Wuertz, but who's your other man inside Gordon's unit
who picked up Rachel? Must have been someone she trusted.
look, if I tell you...you let me go?
it can't hurt your chances.
it was Ramirez.
but you said... -- I just said it could hurt your chances.
you're a lucky man.
but he's not. -- Who?
your driver.
hey man! That ain't right! We should be on that boat!
you wanna ride across with them? Be my guest!
sir, they've stopped their engines. -- Right, get on the radio
tell 'em we'll come back and pick 'em up once we dumped the scumbags.
liberty, this is Spirit, come in. -- What the heck was that?
fox, there's something going on the ferries.
get down to the engine room now.
captain, there're hundred barrels down there ready to blow, and this...
Oh My God! -- Looks like some kind of detonator.
why would they give us the detonator to our own bomb?
tonight, you're all gonna be a part of the social experiment.
I'm ready right now to blow you all sky high
liberty come in, over?
it's dead. -- Anyone tends to get off their boat, you all die.
I'm zeroing in. -- Each of you has a remote
blow up the other boat -- -- The voice is on the ferry, but
it's not the source
west.
Gordon. -- I have the Joker's location.
Prewitt building, assemble on the building opposite.
at midnight, I blow you all up, if however
one of you presses the button, I'll let that boat live
so, who's it gonna be? Harvey Dent's most wanted scumbag
collection or the sweet and innocent civilians?
you choose. Oh!
and you might wanna decide quickly because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.
stay back! -- What and...who are you to decide?
we ought to talk this over, at least. -- We would all have to die?
those men had their chance. -- We are not going to talk about this.
why aren't we talking about? -- We're talking over the same exact thing on the other boat.
let's put it to a vote. -- Yes!!!
barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.
Jim needs you to pack up and put the kids in the car right away.
but there're units outside. -- Those cops can't be trusted.
Jim needs you away from them, as soon as possible!
I'll call them off for 10 minutes, and you'll have to move fast!
Where...where am I suppose to take them? -- 250-52 street.
be there as soon as the patrol car pulls out. -- OK!
she believe you? Because she trusts you!
just like Rachel did!
I didn't know what they were gonna -- -- Didn't know what they gonna do!
you're the second cop to say that to me.
what exactly did you think they were gonna do? -- They got me early on, my mother's hospital bills
don't! -- I am sorry.
live to fight another day, officer.
we found the missing hospital bus. -- Then we have a hostage situation.
this is a shooting gallery. Why would he chooses spot with such good windows?
we have clear shots on five clowns.
snipers take them out, smashed the windows, a team repels in
a team moves in by the stairwells, two, three casualties max.
let's do it. -- It's not that simple, with the Joker, it never is.
what simple is that every second we don't take him, those people on the ferries get closer to blowing
that won't happen! -- Then he'll blow both of them up!
we do not have time for paper -- -- I want everybody
to put their votes on this piece of paper.
if anyone's got pen, pass it along.
we need to get these voting quickly.
I need 5 minutes alone. -- NO! There's no time!
we have clear shots! Dent is in there with them, We have to save Dent!
I have to save Dent!
get ready!
two minutes. Then we breach.
fox, I need picture.
Jim, we're in trouble!
OK, we got POV on Alpha
omni on Beta.
looks like clowns and hostages are on two floors.
the SWAT team on stair way.
another SWAT team on the roof.
dives clear!
barbara, calm down. -- He has the kids!
Hello, Jim. -- Harvey ...
Where's my family? -- Where my family died.
blue team, acquire the target.
entry team, take the charge.
fox, the SWATs are targeting the wrong people! The clowns are hostages!
red team go, Red team go!
keep moving, go!
don't move.
take the shot.
those SWATs are coming in now. -- Clowns, put down your guns!
doctors get down! -- We're ready to fire! Drop your weapons!
Freeze! Stay in there and you
look up! See those bad guys on the floor above?
they're waiting for ambush the SWAT team coming up the elevator.
60 seconds.
here it is, 140 against 396 vote.
so go ahead! Do it!
we are still here
and that means they haven't kill us yet either.
go, go, go!
touble on the floor above.
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot!
we will shoot you, drop the officer! Please drop the officer
on your knees! -- We got him. He's out of the game.
step away from the edge!
stay down! Don't move!
be advice, clowns are hostages, doctors are targets
Ah, you made it! I'm so proud! -- Where's the detonator!
go get him!
no move!
you don't want to die, but you don't know how to take a life.
give it to me
these men would kill you and take it anyway.
no one wants to get their hands dirty?
fine! I'll do it.
those men on that boat, they made their choices
they chose to murder and steal
don't make any sense, for us to die too.
all the old familiar places.
standby.
red team, all secured hostages are safe!
give it to me.
you can tell them, I took it by force.
give it to me, and I'd do what you should did
ten minutes ago.
we really should stop this fighting, otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.
there won't be any fireworks.
and here we...GO!
what were you trying to prove?
that deep down, everyone is as psycho as you? You are alone.
can't rely on anyone these days, you gonna do everything yourself, don't we?
that's ok, I came prepared.
it's a funny world we live in, Speaking of it, you know how I got these scars?
no, but I know how you got these!
Oh...you...you just couldn't let me go, could you?
this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immoveable object.
You...truly are incorruptable, aren't you?
you won't kill me, out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness
and I won't kill you,
because you're just too much fun.
I think you and I, are destined to do this forever.
you'll be in a padded cell forever. -- Maybe we could share one?
then we'll be doubling up the rate this city's inhabitants are losing their minds.
this city, just showed you
that its full of people, ready to believe in good!
until their spirit breaks completely
until they get a good look at the real Harvey Dent
and all the heroic things he's done.
you didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul in a fist fight with you?
you need an ace in the hole
mine is Harvey. -- What did you do?
I took Gotham's White Knight
and I brought him down to our level
it wasn't hard. You see madness, as you know
is ... like gravity.
all it takes, is a little push!
dent!
this is where they brought her, Gordon. Have your man handed her over.
this is where she died. -- I know, I was here.
trying to save her. -- But you didn't
I couldn't. -- Yes, you can have...if you had listened to me.
if you stood up against corruption, instead of doing your deal with the devil.
I was trying to fight the Mob!
you wouldn't dare try to justify yourself if you knew what I'd lost!
have you ever had to talk to the person you love most, tell them its gonna be alright
when you know it's NOT.
well, you're about to know what that feels like, Gordon.
then, you can look me in the eye, and tell me you're sorry!
you're not going to hurt my family... -- No.
just the person you love most!
so, is it your wife?
put the gun down, Harvey... Harvey, put down the gun...
please, Harvey. Please! Oh God!
God damn it, will you stop pointing that gun at my family!
No! -- We have a winner.
no, Jim! Stop it!
Harvey! Harvey!! -- Don't let him
I am sorry!
for Everything!
please don't hurt my son.
you brought your cops? -- All they know is there's a situation
they don't know who or what, they're just creating a perimeter.
you think I want to escape from these? There is no escape from these!
you don't want to hurt the boy, Harvey.
it's not about what I want, it's about what's FAIR!
you thought we could be decent men, in an indecent time?
then you were wrong, the world is cruel
the only morality in a cruel world, is chance.
unbiased, unprejudiced...Fair!
his son's got the same chance she had. 50 - 50
what happened to Rachel wasn't chance. We decide to act. We three!
then why was it me, who is the only one who lost everything!
you wasn't. -- The Joker chose me.
because you were the best of us! He wanted to prove
that even someone as good as you, could fall!
and he was right. -- You're the one pulling the gun, Harvey.
so point it at the people responsible...
fair enough.
you first.
my turn.
Harvey, you're right.
Rachel's death was my fault.
please don't punish the boy
please punish me. -- We about to.
tell your boy it's gonna be alright, Gordon.
lie, like I lied.
it's going to be alright, son.
dad, Daddy, is he OK?
thank you. -- You don't have to thank me.
Yes, I do.
the Joker won.
Harvey's prosecution, everything he fought for
undone.
whatever chance you gave us of fixing our city, dies with Harvey's reputation.
we bet it all on him
the Joker took the best of us and tore him down.
people will lose hope -- -- They won't.
they must never know what he did. -- 5 dead
2 of them cops, you can't sweep that off.
but the Joker cannot win.
Gotham needs its true hero.
no ... -- You either die a hero
or you live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I can do those things because I'm not a hero, unlike Dent.
I killed those people. That's what I can be. -- No, no, you can't. You are not
a hero. Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we needed.
nothing less than a knight... shining.
they'll hunt you. -- You'll hunt me
you'll condemn me
set the dogs on me
because that's what needs to happen.
because sometimes the truth isn't good enough.
sometimes people deserve more.
sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.
Batman?
Batman!
why is he running, Dad?
because we have to chase him. -- OK, we're going in! Go, go! Move!
he didn't do anything wrong.
because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now
so we'll hunt him
because he can take it
because he's not our hero
he's a silent guardian
a watchful protector
a Dark Knight.
I was expecting the Piersons as well, but they're not coming.
please.
Oh! My goodness.
of course. Here, take mine.
I appreciate that both of you are here.
what happened?
the children were at the water fountain during gym and Sally told Becky Pierson she should save some for the fish.
Becky ignored her.
Sally hit the back of her head and her face went into the spigot.
and then Becky went after her.
hair pulling, scratching.
she didn't need stitches in the end, I understand?
this girl-This Becky Pierson, Sally told me she's a bruiser.
she's heavy.
the children poke pencils into her sides when she's sitting because they think she can't feel it.
Sally doesn't do that, does she?
no.
but this bad behavior is new.
I know that you're expecting a child, but she already has a little brother.
I guess what I'm asking is, has anything changed at home recently?
my, um.
my father passed away last week.
the week before two weeks now.
I feel terrible for bringing that up for you.
well, it-it has not been easy.
is this grandpa Gene we're talking about?
Oh, that poor thing.
Sally didn't mention it?
why didn't you call us or send a note?
I don't think she missed a day.
did she go to the funeral?
why would we put her through that?
I don't think children belong in graveyards.
no, of course not.
now I realize why she was asking all those questions about Medgar Evers' murder.
she was?
I'm sorry.
I have to use the ladies' room again.
we can talk about this another time.
no, I'm not as upset as I look. I can't help this.
I am mortified.
it's not a good time.
no, and it really should be, shouldn't it?
Sally does need more attention.
she's grieving.
there is a very special pain to losing someone at that age.
I don't know if you can understand that.
I can.
Mrs. Draper, I was just talking to your husband and this really can wait.
are you sure?
because I just want to put it behind us.
I just really want everything to be okay when the baby comes.
it's going to be a beautiful summer.
hat-check tip 50.
dinner ，$19. 44.
it's better to have a bit of Don Draper than no Don Draper at all.
I'd like that in writing.
it seems strange that the two of you went on the same overnight trip and you put in for $70 and he put in for $82.
if I were lying, wouldn't I have made it a round number?
not that Don's lying.
I signed his receipts, didn't l?
which brings us to the undocumented portion of my assessment.
the amount of pencils, pens, pads, paper and postage that are currently being consumed suit a company four times our size.
it has also been brought to my attention that a credenza has disappeared.
a theft that I believe necessitates a conspiracy.
people forget that Karl Marx was the greatest economist who ever lived.
and whatever you think of his solution, the problem he posed was about the catastrophic up and down of the marketplace.
tell the folks at admiral that Karl Marx says everything's okay.
boom and bust. Bull and bear.
I need a TV. I have a TV.
damn it, Paul, someone helped Ken cherry-pick all of Burt's successful accounts and I've been left with the dogs.
Admiral is not a dog.
sales are flat. It's all over their memos.
and now I have to look then in the eye with nothing...
except maybe new creative.
stop it.
now you're interested.
there are some areas of growth, and I mean literally areas.
atlanta, oakland, chicago, detroit, newark, D.C. Great jazz cities.
and I left out St. Louis and Kansas city-- Also growing.
what does that mean? - Great jazz musicians?
seriously, is it possible that these Admirals are being bought by negroes?
Lois caught her scarf putting paper in the xerox.
maybe when joan leaves I can finally get rid of her.
can you pretend like you're back in the media department and tell me what this says to you?
look at the cities.
is it possible that negroes are outbuying other people 2: 1?
you could jump to that conclusion, I suppose.
did you hear about Lois?
you've got a winner there, Kinsey. Did you see it?
I did.
so what's everybody doing tonight?
baby. Married. Kinsey?
do you want to go to the Mets game?
tickets and a watch.
why, thank you, birds eye.
does the watch say "birds eye" on it?
no, it says "hamilton electric."
what time is it?
what time isn't it?
Admiral is happy. We're happy.
they're not happy!
Morris, comma, in reference to retooling the factory for London fog children's and young adults.
I thought I'd bring you the minutes of the meeting, since you had to run off.
you're wasting paper.
I'd have to make 1, 000 to keep up with your department.
they waste paper because they throw out bad ideas.
they waste paper because they use it to sop up spilled drinks right after their mid-afternoon naps.
you came here because we do this better than you, and part of that is letting our creatives be unproductive until they are.
pennies make pounds, and pounds make profits.
Oh, I don't want to talk to you this way.
I've tried it before and it never works.
I'm not usually this emotional.
you want to make money?
start getting your nails dirty with Bert Cooper and Harry Cane.
clients love to pay for media and creative needs pencils.
I suppose I hadn't necessarily thought of it that way.
and lay off of expense accounts.
think of the men's moral, not just your own.
you've obviously seen "bridge on the river kwai.
I've seen everything.
you have my ticket stubs.
your uncle Herman is on the line.
he won't leave a message.
uncle Herman?
my goodness, is aunt Alice all right?
who is this? - It's Peter, Dottie's boy.
you called me. - It's duck-- Duck Phillips.
duck. - Sorry for the cloak and dagger.
I didn't want to set off any alarm bells.
my name is Herman, you know that.
except that I actually have an uncle Herman and he's 91.
that's a sick joke. I apologize.
it's been too long.
I don't know if you heard, but I'm at Grey now.
what's that like?
people walking around the halls all the time, laughing their heads off?
we're going to have lunch, you know.
I don't know, Duck.
it doesn't sound like a good idea.
Campbell, this is beyond "no hard feelings."
I won't waste your time.
haven't I always been on your side?
when? - I'll have my girl call your girl.
I'll say it's Clorox.
Hello?
anyone home?
I'll get it.
hello. - Mr. Draper?
Yes.
this is Suzanne Farrell, Sally's teacher.
I'm not interrupting dinner, am I?
no.
I just felt I should call and apologize about our meeting this morning.
Why?
well, I..
what I mean is my father died when I was eight and I might have overdone it, relating to Sally in that way.
I didn't mean to upset your wife.
I guess I can get a little caught up in things and lose perspective.
I don't know why I'm calling.
I'm embarrassing myself.
no, you're fine.
if there's anything I can do-- - Don?
thanks for the call.
it's time to go.
okay, we're going. Let me get my keys.
they're in your hand.
Francine took the kids.
who was that?
no one.
if you're parked in emergency, you'll have to move soon.
of course, let's make sure it's not a false alarm.
this is my third time.
we sent you home before? - No, third baby.
your job's done.
the solarium's down the hall to the right.
hang in there, Betts.
I came in early to cover for a friend, so there's a chance I'll see you the whole way through.
daddy!
you can scream and yell as much as you want in this hallway, but we're about to pass the nursery.
of course.
excuse me.
I know it's silly, but I seem to be having trouble with this pen.
I believe it's empty.
I've gotta go.
are you planning to give the baby the breast?
no.
the last time you ate? - Lunch
toast, cottage cheese, pineapple.
pineapple?
what were you thinking?
anything else, sweetheart?
life savers.
has your water broken?
my water never breaks.
when will Dr. Aldridge be here?
I'm dennis hobart.
that's good to know.
I haven't seen anybody an hour.
what's going on?
well, we've had a shift change.
my wife Pam, Pamela Hobart.
she's fine. The baby's breech.
we're calling in a specialist.
what?
didn't somebody get your permission?
damn it, what is with you people? I don't know a damn thing!
please don't raise your voice.
now I apologize, but we need your permission.
do whatever you have to do.
we'll update you religiously. I promise.
this is not how I pictured it.
Where's all the backslapping?
you know, I brought this because I thought it'd be a party in here.
it's not, but I'll have one.
right now?
whenever you want.
I left work this morning.
I've been here all day.
I am so bored.
I even called in.
like the prison can't run without me.
have you done this before?
twice.
you know, I never thought to bring a bottle.
well, what are we supposed to do?
my daughter took forever.
I remember being pretty worked up.
the nurse said, "don't forget，your wife's in the boat, you're on the shore."
the other one a boy?
Yes.
you throw the ball around?
not enough.
all right, Mrs. Draper, I'm going to need you to get on the bed so I can prepare you for delivery.
this part should be familiar.
I'll shave you and then give you a quick low enema.
well, the good news is time has stopped.
I'd like to have a gold watch one day, but I can't, you know?
you don't want to have anything on you like that.
do they attack you?
I knew it was just a matter of time before you started with the questions.
I bet you have a nightmare where you end up in Sing Sing, right?
everybody does.
I do.
so what's it like?
you're outnumbered, but you've got the power.
kind of like being a king.
except your subjects want to kill you.
maybe, but they don't cause they know I'm dangerous and I've got a badge, which they respect.
how do they know you're dangerous?
well, they're not all bad.
there's extremes.
we've got death row and then we've got the baseball team.
in '29 they played the yankees.
everybody in stripes.
you're a funny one.
Oh, I tell a lot of jokes at work.
you hear some doozies.
I have to watch what I do when I leave work, be careful not to bring it home.
especially with a kid, right?
just yesterday I was in a block and I thought "every single one of these animals, their mother had them, they were a baby."
and I think, "there they are, on the other side of the fence."
and you know what?
every one of them blamed their mom and dad.
that's a bullshit excuse.
that's true, Don.
you have little veins.
breathe and think about the beauty parlor.
do you need to call someone else in?
it's in.
the medication will help with the pain and put you in a twilight sleep.
where is Dr. Aldridge?
he's in the city.
he went to mama Leone's for his anniversary.
isn't that sweet? - Is he drinking?
cause my aunt emma, her doctor was drunk, and he ruined her bladder.
Dr. Mendelowitz, the obstetrician, is on duty and will fill in.
I don't want him. I don't know him.
he's our top man. - I want Dr. Aldridge.
you have absolutely nothing to worry about.
I don't want another doctor. I want my doctor.
sit back. You're at 5cm.
that's halfway from here to the Hebrides and other mountain ranges which we are currently studying in chapter 12.
the doctor will be here and there.
the Hebrides are islands.
try it now.
thank you, sister.
what do you make her for? 16?
Pam was screaming at me in the car.
don't think that's unusual.
that's my girl in there.
if something happens to her, I just don't know what I'd do.
and then there'd be that baby. How could I love that baby?
our worst fears lie in anticipation.
you're so sure about that?
I want to go home, you bitch!
please relax.
let go of me! Get your hands off me!
Where's Don? - He's in the waiting room.
she can't hear you. - The hell I can't.
where is he? Where's Don?!
he's in the waiting room.
bullshit.
he's never where you expect him to be.
have you seen him?
have you been with him?
7cm. She's starting transition.
someone call him.
I don't want to be here.
a push of demerol, 25mg.
I'm just a housewife.
why are you doing this to me?
Mr. Hobart?
Congratulations. You have a little baby boy.
Oh my god.
your wife and your baby are doing fine.
can I go in? Can I see her?
not right now.
she lost a lot of blood and had a transfusion.
what? Oh, please, I have to see her.
please, she's in recovery, resting.
but you can go to the nursery and look in at your son.
it's just down the hall.
thank you.
a baby boy.
Congratulations.
you're all right, Don.
I'm sure yours is gonna be good too.
you know what?
I know it.
Thanks, Dennis.
you're an honest guy.
believe me. I'm an expert.
go see your baby.
why do they put up with us?
we don't deserve it.
this is a fresh start.
I don't know who's up there, so I'm saying this to you.
I'm gonna be better.
I'm gonna be a better man.
tell me you heard me.
I heard you.
don't fight the urge to bear down.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't do it.
either you can do it or we will, but it's going to come out some way.
daddy?
who are you? - It's me.
I don't know you.
it's me-elizabeth.
you do know me.
okay, so it's me.
what are you doing here?
I had to go away.
well, don't you Miss me?
of course.
listen.
nobody knows I'm here, okay?
am I dying?
ask your mother.
tell her, Ruthie.
Elizabeth, shut your mouth.
you'll catch flies.
I left my lunch pail on the bus and I'm having a baby.
do you see what happens to people who speak up?
be happy with what you have.
you'll be okay.
you're a house cat
you're very important and you have little to do.
she's beautiful.
that's a boy.
you look terrible.
how do you feel?
I need to put my face on.
you look beautiful, Betts.
what did you say?
his name is Eugene.
we don't have to decide that now.
did you get any sleep?
no, and I don't expect to for the next six months.
I wasn't sure where to put it all.
Mr. Draper's office.
please hold.
it's Mr. Sterling. Are you in?
daddy.
where are you? - Down the hall.
how's Betty? Did she perform like a champ?
she did. - I need his initials.
Jane's gonna put them on the back of her yacht or something for him.
no name yet.
there's a lot of guys twiddling their thumbs down in art.
why were you in the art department?
lane was.
apparently we're all backed up.
no one will move forward without your approval.
I missed half a day.
well, Betty had the baby, not you.
I'll see what I can do.
good.
that guy's a tick.
see you at the traffic meeting.
can I get some coffee?
you know what it's like in that office.
no one ever buys me lunch.
I like the turtleneck.
Really?
come. Join us.
what is she doing here?
don't worry about it. I know what I'm doing.
no, you don't.
have a nosh.
two months at Grey and you're already having a nosh?
I didn't know until I got here.
look.
I woke up one day and had a realization.
you two have a secret relationship.
what? That's ridiculous.
come on.
the way you handled that Freddy Rumsen thing so that she could move up?
I've been doing this a long time. I know what I saw.
that's not what happened.
you can be modest if you want to, but that kind of focused ambition is rare in advertising.
thank you.
I want to take you both with me to the promised land.
at Grey an account man is expected to have ideas, and creatives are expected to be geniuses.
you'll be sitting on velvet pillows, showered with riches, awards.
we're not going anywhere.
well, she can.
do we have to go together?
Pete, I know you have ideas and you're a risk-taker.
sterling Cooper is never going to reward that.
well, thank you.
anything else? - Don't be a baby.
you should be taking meetings like this twice a week.
if you want to woo me, you'll have to buy me my own lunch.
maybe I should leave too.
why would you do that?
you're so talented.
you should strike while they iron's hot.
what does that mean? - It means the sky's the limit.
no mortgage, no family.
you're a free-going career gal with great ideas.
am I wrong?
I don't know.
this is your time, Peggy.
let me ask you something, Hollis, what type of TV do you have?
an RCA. - Really?
color?
why did you get it?
to watch TV.
but why an RCA specifically?
I didn't see any difference, I guess.
16.0
good afternoon.
a lot of negroes prefer Admiral.
I've done research.
I have an RCA.
so do your friends buy Admirals?
I'm sorry, sir. I can't really say.
look.
this is important and I'd really like to have an honest conversation with you.
I don't want to get into trouble.
it's just us.
it's just hollis and-- - Mr. Campbell.
do you think I'm a bigot?
I just want to know why you bought your TV.
I don't know. I don't remember.
it's your TV.
it's a big purchase.
I don't even watch the damn thing.
Really? Why not?
why should I?
we've got bigger problems to worry about than TV, okay?
you're thinking about this in a very narrow way.
the idea is that everyone is going to have a house, a car, a television
the American dream.
it's my job.
every job has it's ups and downs.
you don't watch baseball?
I don't believe you.
what are you doing out of bed?
I smelled something.
what are you making? - A snack.
do you want some? - Uh-huh.
I didn't know you could cook.
mommy's much better at it.
are you looking for a chick?
I am.
miss Farrell told us about that when we went to the farm.
but she says that those eggs can never become a chicken, even though they come out of a chicken.
Why's that?
because they're from the store.
and you know what else?
if you hold an egg up and it has veins in it, you can shake it then eat it.
Really? - Mm-hmm.
it's called addling.
is the baby gonna live in grandpa Gene's room?
it's not grandpa Gene's room.
it's the baby's room.
I thought it was gonna be a girl.
well, I thought you were gonna be a boy.
not all surprises are bad.
everything's gonna be fine.
that's what miss Farrell said.
well, then I guess it must be true.
Burt Peterson's firing was undignified.
building security-- That's all I'll say.
confirm a couple of rumors.
did he throw a desk chair against a window only to have it bounce back and knock him over?
not that I know of.
did he make a #2 in a file cabinet?
Burt Peterson lived hard and loved hard.
so Harry here is an expert in media.
Television-- The air, not the sets.
now Admiral television sales are flat...
we know that.
...but as we studied your indices we realized that they're not flat everywhere.
in fact, among negroes sales are actually growing.
we know that too.
you do?
no, of course you do.
these are your numbers, but I think we've discovered an interesting strategy.
this is "Ebony."
by negroes for negroes.
jet.
space in these magazines costs far less than what you currently spend
daily newspapers that go just to this market for pennies on the dollar.
And?
shift a portion of the media budget from lower-indexing white areas to this market where it can do more good.
they already like it and we can make them buy more by increasing the exposure.
a 5% sales bump in Detroit alone would make you the same profit as a 2% increase systemwide.
and ads on television geared to this market and white markets will have double the effect.
a negro ad and a white ad?
so, Campbell, you're making twice the ads for us now.
no, do them together.
integrate it.
I don't think that's legal.
of course it's legal.
look, this conversation is not worth having.
who's to say that negroes aren't buying Admiral televisions because they think white people want them?
miss Olson is here to see you.
send her in.
Oh, sorry.
I know he doesn't need clothes, but don't return it.
I'm the youngest. I never had anything new.
you didn't have to do that.
I did.
no one told me they were all going in on it together.
I heard you were back at work, but now I wonder if that's true.
I invited you in.
I don't know if this is the best time.
I don't know. It's kind of serious.
I've been thinking about my situation here and I'm so grateful to you for all you've done.
I just...well,you know I'm paid very little.
my secretary doesn't respect me because I make $71 more a week than she does.
maybe we need to get you a cheaper secretary.
paul Kinsey doesthe same work that I do, and not as well sometimes.
and I don't know if you read it in the paper, but they passed a law where women who do the same work as men will get paid the same thing.
equal pay.
it's not a good time.
it's not a good time for me, Don.
do you know how expensive the city is?
it's not gonna happen, Peggy, not now.
I'm fighting for paperclips around here.
third time.
it must be old hat.
you're gonna be fine, Peggy.
I look at you and I think "I want what he has."
Really?
you have everything, and so much of it.
I suppose that's probably true.
what do you want me to say?
I don't think I could have been any clearer.
you see what's been going on here the last six months?
what if this is my time?
Hey.
where are you going?
to the ladies' room. You want to join me?
did you tell Don about Duck?
that's none of your business. - Sure.
they hear you're shopping around, they'll want you more.
but me, I'm sharing my job with Kenny.
I'm already redundant.
you have relationships with your clients.
that's leverage. - Did you say something?
it's my decision, Pete.
your decisions affect me.
if it isn't Martin Luther King, I shoud drop kick you off the roof.
Admiral television has no interest in becoming a colored television company.
but they are.
it seems illogical to me that they would reject an opportunity to make more money.
then again, I'm in advertising.
this is a sensitive issue.
businesses hate that.
let me put it in account terms.
are you aware of the number of hand jobs I'm gonna have to give?
am I being taken off the account?
I'm going to have to pretend I had you killed!
sales are flat. I had to do something.
I don't know if anyone's ever told you that half the time this business comes down to "I don't like that guy."
are we done with the flogging?
it's never as good as you think it's gonna be.
if I may.
Burt, Roger, it does seem as though there's money to be made in the negro market.
obviously not with Admiral, but I don't think it would be wrong of us to pursue it in some way.
Really?
I've just moved here.
I'm a stranger in a strange land, but I can tell you that there's definitely something going on.
we'll look into it.
you can go.
we're here! -she's here! - Mommy! Mommy!
welcome welcome.
mommy!
Ooh, careful.
here, let me take him.
I missed you so much.
wait till you see your fridge.
if there's a power outage, you can feed the entire street for a month.
Hi, baby. I'm your brother Bobby.
remember: you have to be careful.
how was it?
you know.
it Was all a fog.
you're making a mistake not forcing Carla to stay.
she's been away from her family, and I can manage.
I know some girls.
you want something to eat?
sure. - I've got it.
come on.
see, that feels good, doesn't it, huh?
all right, well, I'm off to the office.
to start off, are there any of you that have any particular problems you'd like to tell me about?
don't be bashful. You're among friends.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
let him be, 'cause he's learning how to kind of settle in with you.
a lot of times, rather than helping people with horse problems, I'm helping horses with people problems.
and for a lot of people, they want it all to be fuzzy and warm and cosmic, but it is no different with a horse than with a kid.
you can't always be the kid's best friend.
first you have to be the parent.
a horse like this isn't any different than a kid that takes everybody's milk money on the way to school or beats up old people.
maybe it isn't the kid's fault.
maybe the parent ought to be in jail.
boy, do you feel like a fool and kind of like a failure?
you know? - Aw, it's all right.
people bring a lot of baggage to the table when they come to these.
sometimes they're here for a different reason other than just getting to where they can ride their horse a little bit better.
if you find a way to fit this thing right here, it'll make you better.
it'll make you better in areas that you didn't think related to horses.
good job, buddy.
horses are my life, and because of some of the things I've been through as a kid, I found some safety and some companionship in the horses.
I was just looking for kind of a peaceful place to be where I wasn't threatened, where my life wasn't threatened.
so I have an empathy for horses that when something is scared for their life, I understand that.
he's a pretty nice horse, six years old.
making some good progress, anyway.
just a youngster, just telling him...I want him to be aware of me.
if I slow down, I want him to slow down.
see, if I go like this...I have to practice my old man walk.
so when I'm really old, it might take me an hour to get over there.
he ought to be able to just go with me, as slow as I want to go, and not crowd me.
might be a little slower than what he'd like to go.
if I stop, he ought to stop.
if I go back, he ought to go back, and I ought not to have to beg him.
right now, I walk at a little faster pace, but I'm always testing him to see if he's with me.
when I first seen him, I thought, "What kind of voodoo stuff is this, you know?
how are you getting this done, you know?
he walks into a round pen.
in five minutes, he's got a horse following him around like a dog.
he and I go together.
most of us have a bag of tricks, and Buck has an arsenal.
Hey, boys.
morning.
Hello, how you doing?
good. - Good.
colt starting is always interesting because most of the youngsters have never been saddled, never had anyone on their back or a bit in their mouth.
so there is a lot of fear in both the horse and the human.
the way I do these colt classes, you guys, you'll have to get them exposed to a lot of things that seem perfectly normal to you, but it doesn't seem normal to the horse.
you walk up to them smelling like a Big Mac, you know, or something...
your diet is gonna make you smell different to the horse, and then you're gonna tell the horse, "Don't worry. I want to crawl on you...
in a similar posture to how a lion would attack and kill a horse.
they jump right up in the middle of them, and they reach their front claws around, and as they're biting down on their spine, they're cutting their throat with their claws.
you're asking the horse to let you be in that posture and crawl on him.
and then about the time he says, "All right, maybe,
and then you say, "Oh, oh, one more thing.
I want to strap some hides of other dead animals around you before I crawl on you.
you damn sure have to have some trust.
he's got to believe in you to let you do that, and amazingly enough, they'll let you do it.
now, the first thing that I'm gonna show you is leading the horse by.
step in here. Extend the front over like that.
then he'll go on forward around me.
this takes some practice to get good at.
your horse might be afraid to move.
it's a real trust thing between the two of you.
what's your name, dear?
Martha?
okay, Martha, you want to go the other way.
you got your horse leading by good, just the wrong direction.
that's all right.
tap her.
don't be afraid of tapping her with that flag.
you aren't gonna hurt her.
it would be like you getting spanked with a sock.
there, yeah.
Dave, lead with the right hand.
Yeah, it's in your left hand.
the other left.
walk to the hip.
no, walk to the hip.
you're at the head. That's the eating end.
this is always a hard one for folks.
Pam, that walking on you.
now, your horse is kind of naughty.
you guys make a big old circle around me.
this horse, it knows to get away, 'cause she's pretty fearful.
no, you won't get away.
she said, "I thought I had the angle on you there.
see that head slinging to the outside?
that's unacceptable.
but she doesn't know the difference.
she said, "Well, up to this point, I've had some pretty damn good luck with that technique.
see there where she went to run me over?
that means she's trying to protect herself.
but when I get done, I will not have to close my hand on the end of this rope.
now, I'd touch her here on the neck.
I'd say, "You find out this flag won't hurt you.
nobody's here to hurt you.
one of the things that really struck me was that you always grow up hearing about breaking horses or breaking broncos or something.
there's a whole element of abuse, really, of, it's...
man is stronger than this big animal.
we can break them down almost like Parris Island and a drill instructor, and I think it first clicked for me with Buck at the whole concept of starting.
my early exposure to horses was severe:
tying horses to posts with an inner tube tire so that when the horse pulled back, they would slam back into the post.
it was really brutal, really, truly brutal.
it was heartbreaking.
I didn't know any difference. I was a child.
but I remember crying a lot.
I felt very, very bad for the animals.
so when I met Buck, I was the instant convert.
you can't be a good guy when you leave the barn and a bad guy when you get to the barn.
and if I treat animals this way, do I treat people that way too?
we all know the answer to that.
I met Buck probably at his first clinic that he gave.
if I wasn't at his first clinic, I was probably at his second.
there was a nice change.
and the first time I saw was amazing to me.
l... l... it just blew my mind.
it just blew my mind that it could be done in a way that the horse would cooperate, like the people, and not be scarred up and afraid for life.
I couldn't believe what that man could do with a horse without anything on it.
I mean, he could load horses in a horse trailer without touching them.
I mean, it... the horse has never been in a trailer.
that's phenomenal.
why let an animal live in fear?
why not fix it?
that's pretty good.
you notice how I don't have to have a death grip on the doggone lead rope now.
in this particular discipline, if you want to be great, you have to be a sensitive person.
that vulnerability, that sensitivity to feel the subtle change is what makes you great.
that's why so many of the folks that are really good at this are... you know, sometimes they're tortured souls, you know?
I've seen some kind of dark things in my life, but everybody has a bit of a burden to bear of some sort, so it's all relative.
it's all I ever wanted to be was a cowboy.
I grew up as a trick roper.
that wasn't necessarily by choice, but the first thing is, we were entertainers, my brother and I.
I started doing rope tricks when I was three years old.
you wouldn't think that a three-year-old could be doing rope tricks, but I was doing rope tricks.
I turned professional when I was six.
and as far as I know, we are still the youngest kids to ever get a PRCA card, which was the RCA in those days, Rodeo Cowboy Association.
and we went to fairs and rodeos and performed all over.
but we really enjoyed the attention of the crowds.
we were kind of childhood celebrities, you know.
we were the Kellogg's Sugar Pops kids.
you know, fancy roping takes hard work, plenty of sleep, and good nutrition every day.
here's a good hardworking breakfast.
Oh, it must have been 1970, '71, right around in there.
it was just before my mom passed away.
that was quite a thing.
and all I remember about that commercial, it should have been real fun, 'cause it was a big thrill to all the kids in school that we were on national television doing these TV commercials.
all I really remember about that is that my dad beat us unmercifully for not putting on a perfect performance, and then he drove us home, and, heck, he couldn't even wait till we got home.
he stopped and knocked on us a little bit more.
I remember my mom would drop us off at school.
the last couple of years she was alive, she was working as a waitress in Ennis, Montana, and I would beg her not to leave,
every day, I would cry, because I was just terrified of the fact that I was gonna be five or six hours alone with our dad when we got home from school before my mom would get home, 'cause things always went better when she was around.
but then when my mom died, I knew my life was over as I knew it, and I no longer had my protector.
well, after my mom passed away, my dad really fell apart, and night after night after night, he would come yank us out of the bed in the middle of the night and make us sit at this kitchen table, this oak table.
I could draw the grain in that table for you to this day, 'cause you'd just stare down at the table, because even to just look at my dad when he was ranting and raving in a drunken stupor, he would take that as an aggressive expression.
and one night, I just said, "I'm not gonna get beat up again tonight.
I'm just... I can't do it.
and I made a mad dash outside and not thinking about the fact that I wasn't very well-dressed for being outside in the middle of the winter, 'cause it was cold.
it was somewhere between 10, 20 below zero.
well, damn, then I was really stuck, because I knew if I went back inside, he was gonna beat me half to death, and I just couldn't go back in.
I just couldn't.
we had a dog, and his name was Duke, and I loved that dog.
it sounds real trailer park, I know, but he lived in a 55-gallon barrel with straw in it for his bed, and I crawled in that 55-gallon barrel with that bloodhound.
it wasn't warm, but it kept me from freezing, and I finally, after two or three hours, went back in the house, and he just looked at me like, "Where have you been?
Reata, I can't believe you answered your phone.
where are you?
Oh, cool. What are you doing?
for your mom or for school?
for school.
all right, well, I'll call her back, and then I'll talk to you tomorrow, huh?
okay, sounds good.
okay, love you, buddy.
Bye.
I was watching Oprah.
I don't know if I should admit to that.
but I was watching Oprah, and she said that the greatest aphrodisiac there was for a man was to have a vacuum and to actually run it in the presence of his wife.
so she knows quite a bit, so I thought, "Well, I'll... it can't hurt.
you know, you never know where you're gonna get some information.
Hey, you.
gonna put the smaller one in the back.
there's not quite as much room.
we got 27 years in now.
Yeah, 27 years.
I get to where I don't even worry about what day it is.
all I know is, it's just all in four-day intervals for me.
I don't know; you get in a rhythm by doing this, and you... oh, after just a few days of being somewhere, you're kind of ready to go to the next one.
Hey, Mary, it's just me.
good. What are you doing?
got the clinic done here. Didn't make anybody cry.
talk to you later on.
all right, Mary, I miss you.
I do this 40 weeks out of the year.
for the rest of the year, you could say, "Where are you gonna be on such and such a day?
and I could tell you exactly where I'm gonna be till about Thanksgiving.
Walkertown, North Carolina.
huntsville, Alabama.
limerick, Maine.
Bay Harbor, Michigan.
cedar Rapids, Iowa.
Longmont, Colorado.
Thermopolis, Wyoming.
bend, Oregon.
bozeman, Montana.
Libby, Montana.
Yeah, there's some loneliness.
you know, it's truck stops and driving late at night and just trying to get to your next spot, and you're alone, you know?
that's when you really miss your family, and you want to be home, and you think of what it would be like just walking barefoot across the living room and going to bed.
but there is no way that's ever gonna be anything other than what it is.
how are you? - Hey, how are you?
she's gonna make me a Manhattan.
and I can make more than one if somebody wants one.
they're in the back.
were you at that clinic in Ellensburg when it was so cold, when Bob Blackwell...
Yeah, that was 17 years ago.
that was my first clinic with you.
and they brought them in, these horses in, in stock trailers, literally.
they opened up the door, and they went into the round pen, and there was 15 or 17 colts, and he roped every one of them.
a mutual friend invited me, and I was pretty skeptical about the clinic and the approach.
and I went pretty convinced that I wasn't gonna appreciate anything that I saw.
and then he started working with all these babies...
and I was blown away.
I mean, I couldn't believe what I saw and the rapport that he had with them.
you know, it just kind of stopped me in my tracks.
my whole life has been encompassed around Arabian and half-Arabian show horses from the time I was a little girl.
I was showing horses and thinking that everything was cool, the way I was doing things and the way I saw things being done, and I'm proud of a lot of those prizes that I won, but I'm equally ashamed of a lot of them too.
horses are put into forced positions that they're neither mentally or physically prepared to handle, and these practices aren't used nearly as much now as they were years ago, but the horses would be put into hock hobbles that would go from the hocks up through the snaffle and back down so that every time he took a step with his hocks, you know, it'd take ahold of his face to teach him to stay into that real infixed position.
but there's no connection for the horse.
there's no understanding of that except for it hurts.
so they're gonna stay away from those pressures and learn to infix themselves into those positions because... through intimidation.
and I just thought that that's the way you did it.
and that's what the horses had to do to be show horses, and you don't realize how unjust it is until you...
until someone shows you a different path.
come on.
let's say the horse needed you to be firm.
there's a difference between firm and hard.
let's say I needed to take ahold of the horse with 20 pounds.
the way I go about getting to 20 pounds is gonna have a lot to do with whether you're successful or not.
hold on to that.
I'm gonna pull on you some, so don't let me get it away from you.
okay, so close your hand on that, or it's gonna come away from you, and don't give to me.
let's say I needed to pull on this horse about that hard.
the way I took ahold of you wasn't really offensive, and wouldn't make you afraid.
but let's say I was abrupt and had hands like a butcher and I took ahold of the horse like that.
now, I'm pulling about like what I said, but it's how I got there.
be ready.
it's how I got there that could be rude to the horse.
now, watch Robert closely.
I'm just riding with bad hands.
Oh, you braced.
I didn't hit you. Why'd you do that?
he's protecting himself.
once I've done this a few times with him, he'll brace all the time like that.
see him brace? You can't help yourself.
and I'm even telling you you're gonna do it.
and you still can't help it.
but if I took ahold like this, you might give to me, and then I'd give to you.
but it's the way I go about it, and whenever you're ready, maybe you'd give to me, see.
otherwise I'll just wait here.
nobody's gonna get any lunch today.
when you started to soften, so did I, and you both feel together.
if you were real sensitive to me when I feel of you here, you'd already be giving, see?
that means something to my horse.
that's what a soft feel...
that's what I do to get a soft feel right there.
and I want you to get at least a mental picture of what a horse operating on a feel is to where hopefully it looks good to you, that you'll want that, that you'll strive for that.
so this is one example of a feel, see.
I could even take on this rope right here like this, see.
that's operating on a feel, see.
I could do this and say, "Get back.
and I could do this and say, "Get over.
without touching him, your energy moves the horse.
most people think of a feel as when you touch something or someone and what it feels like to your fingers, but a feel can have a thousand different definitions.
sometimes feel is a mental thing.
sometimes feel can happen clear across the arena.
that's what I'm looking for there.
sort of an invitation from the horse to come to you.
it's not always physical. Sometimes it's mental.
when you have the physical working for you when you're younger, you ride with 90% physical and 10% mental.
but if you could learn how to use 90% mental and 10% physical, you'd be better off.
I'm looking for the horse to learn how to follow a feel.
it's supposed to take that much.
little bit more. There.
left, right, left, right, left, right.
everything is a dance.
everything you do with a horse is a dance.
now I'll open him up a little bit here.
problem is, when a lot of folks can't get a horse to operate on a feel, they'll get a little more bridle, get a little more shank on it, drive a spur through the horse's shoulder, then tie his head down, then get a bicycle chain over his nose.
I mean, it doesn't stop.
it becomes medieval.
now, I'm gonna tip the life up in him here.
we're moving on a feel.
you know, a horse is pretty sensitive.
a horse can feel a mosquito land on their butt in a windstorm.
every movement you make on a horse, there is a perfect position of balance that takes no energy from the horse.
he doesn't feel like he is pushing you along with him or dragging you along with him.
he's built to fit a horse, you know?
God had him in mind when he made a cowboy, you know?
I've never actually seen him whisper a horse, but I guess if there's a horse whisperer out there, it's Buck Brannaman.
I don't know, you know?
originally, I got connected to The Horse Whisperer through Nick Evans, and he said, "I'm researching some characters for my book, and I'm trying to find a way to bring this character to life.
and I was doing a clinic in California, and kind of a hippie-looking guy came up, and he said, "I'm a movie producer.
he said, "I was wondering if you could meet with me and Bob.
I said, "Bob?"
in my business, artificiality is part of the business.
you look for authentic people.
and so when I met Buck, my first thought was, "Well, what the hell is this?
a guy walks into an office in Santa Monica.
he's got a big hat on.
he's got his vest and so forth.
he looks like he's got a costume on, and I thought "Oh, my God, you know, what's..."
and his compatriot who was with him, the same outfit, and I thought, "Oh, jeez, what have I gotten into here?
and then the etiquette, the politeness, the humanity that kind of came off real quick and kind of erased that, and then we sat in the office for about an hour and a half and talked about things that were authentic, and so I realized that I was really dealing with what I would call "the real deal."
no-nonsense guy, no-nonsense, you know, whether with the animal or people.
he was an advisor that I brought on that slowly worked his way into the core of the filmmaking because he just knew more.
so Buck contributed everything as a model and also as a player.
I used him as a double.
so he was a huge part of the fabric of the film, and he was able to do things that the hired trainer could not do.
there was a scene that Scarlett was supposed to go into the stall with the horse, and it was her first time being near the horse since the accident, and the action for the horse was, he was supposed to sort of paw the ground and show a little aggression and then come to her and respond to her and more or less put his head in her arms, and it was an, "Aw, gee," a real touching scene, and they couldn't get the shot because the horse was a trick horse, and they are trained to not take their eyes off the trainer.
the horse nuzzled the wood. The horse nuzzled the frame.
the horse nuzzled the boots of the trainer but wouldn't nuzzle Scarlett.
the meter was ticking, and, you know, time is money and all that stuff.
so I was going into a panic.
they said, "What are we gonna do?"
I said, "What do you mean, what are you gonna do?"
he said, "Well, we never got that shot."
I said, "Yeah, we sure spent a long time at it too."
he said, "Yeah, eight hours. You got any ideas?"
I said, "Yeah, why don't we use my horse, Pet?"
and at first, everybody said, "Well, you know, you don't understand, Buck .You know, we use Hollywood trick horses for this because they're performers, and they can do things on the mark so we can pull a focus on a certain place, and you just don't understand that."
"we don't... not downplay your thing, Buck," "but it's like... but Pet," "he doesn't know how to work on a mark."
he's not an actor.
I said, "No, he's a horse."
I said, "What do you have to lose?"
so I dinked around with my horse and got him where I could lead him by front foot with a rope on him, and I got him where I could jiggle that rope, and he'd paw the ground on the mark.
so he came up, and he just put his head right in her chest, and she wrapped her arms around that horse, laid her head on his forehead, and everybody was crying.
God, within 15, 20 minutes, it was done.
so Buck played a greater role than a lot of people realize.
he contributed everything.
there was a humanity and a kind of gentleness of spirit that I adopted for that character because of Buck.
when I saw the finished product, he looked good.
I told him, "There is some potential there, Bob, if this movie thing doesn't work out for you, I think I could probably get you to where you could make a living doing this."
this one you want me to take right here?
Yeah.
okay, Reata.
I might have you check on Charro and see if he's eaten.
okay.
I've been traveling with Dad during the summers, usually from end of June till end of August.
it's been two months since I've seen my dad.
my dad's on the road nine months out of the year, and it's tough, but I'm kind of used to it now.
I mean, I've been doing it since I was... well, forever, so...
heads up.
we've got a few sacks of feed to schlep across here.
Reata, you and Nevada need to go wrap up all the sound.
Yeah, Nevada's going with me.
my partner in crime.
I just started traveling with them last year.
I spent a month with them.
I think we're helpful to a point.
sometimes maybe we're in the way, 'cause he has, like, a way of doing things, you know?
what are you doing?
bring you breakfast.
what is it? - Sticky buns.
I might just have one.
I don't want the...
that'll do me.
Thanks, mate.
so I guess you got a lot of songs transferred for me on my iPod.
traveling with Dad, it can get pretty stressful sometimes just because he is, like, a travel Nazi.
make sure you plug that little deal... give me that.
cause he has his own way of how he does everything, and we kind of mess up the process sometimes.
Aw, Reata.
Aw, you put the top on backwards.
but then when it comes to, like, cleaning pens and saddling his horses and stuff like that,
I think he kind of appreciates us.
how'd you do?
nasty.
Hey, Reata. - Yeah.
bring me back a sack for trash when you...
after you feed.
sure.
I ride every summer.
I usually take one of my horses.
step up in here and get a dally on and stop my horse.
I get a lot... I learn a lot on it.
every clinic that we go to during the summer is different.
the horses are different, different people.
there, you followed by feel.
the horse world can be pretty cliquey.
well, we don't go for cliques around here.
there are probably some people here that it's just pittance, pocket change for them to come, and some of them save all year long just to be able to go to this clinic.
put on my Madonna microphone.
how we fixed here, Maggie?
you getting his chin down a little bit?
you want to release as quick as you can.
he's gonna give in a second.
there, there.
pet him. That's the way.
my daughter, she had a hard time releasing.
I'd say, "Reata, your arms," and she'd go like that.
spread your hands a little more. Get them a little lower.
there you go.
nice.
you want that horse to be an extension of you, but then you don't control your legs.
you think you're just gonna control this part of the body.
this is a body. The whole thing is a body.
if all of you didn't have a horse here and I was trying to talk to you, wouldn't that be weird if you said, "Hey, I don't have control of my legs.
all of a sudden, they just tear off, and you're like, "Oh, jeez, sorry.
waiting on the coffee.
he's got to have his coffee.
black, I'm sure that comes as a big surprise.
he has the coffee, and then he lets down, and it kind of smooths out.
go to Sheridan, Montana.
Sheridan, Montana, is there, and we're up here, probably seven hours.
not too long.
Yeah, it's a great bunch of folks at this clinic.
good to see you. - Good to see you.
welcome to Montana.
a lot of them, I've known since I was a kid.
some of them, I went to school with.
some of them, I went to school with their parents.
it's like... it's coming home for me here.
it's gonna be a busy week, 'cause Mom's gonna be in Sheridan.
Hi.
how are you? - I'm good.
how are you?
I haven't seen Mary for a couple of months.
Hi, Dally. Hi, buddy.
so it's been an awful long run.
Mary, she doesn't like to travel as much, but I'd sure like her to go with me a little bit more, and she may go with me a little bit more once Reata goes off to college.
so this is Twyla, Rudy. This is Dally.
Oh, Dally. - Hey, Rudy.
Rudy's grown a little bit since I left.
I don't know how many dogs you need before you have enough dogs.
they worked their way up the food chain past me, but my wife loves them, and I love my wife, so if it makes her happy...
makes me happy.
I actually do like traveling on the road.
it's fun. It's really fun.
I mean, you get to meet a lot of different people and see a lot of different beautiful places.
like, this place is amazing.
but I like staying home too, though.
okay, are there any of you that have any real problems with them that you'd like to kind of mention?
he runs me over.
he runs you over?
okay, lovely.
well, a baby like that, they're not trying to be pushy.
they might be sort of crowding you just a little bit because they still might be scared.
they kind of think that maybe if they get real close to you, they'll get some comfort.
and the big thing, you guys, is, don't be overly critical of them, 'cause they're just babies.
if he feels like you're angry at him at all, he will shut down.
I don't know where Buck draws his real personal strength from, because he's lived through a lot.
I mean, it...
he came out of such dire straits and, you know, was virtually, I think, plucked from his home in the middle of the night sort of a thing.
it's a real hard story to tell, 'cause, you know, you see him now, and, you know, I don't even think about that.
ace was real hard on those boys.
you knew there was something wrong there maybe, but you weren't for sure what.
you know, he kept it hid pretty well, I guess, until the point when Coach Cleverly...
you know, seen his back.
Ah, that's a hard story to think about.
Bob Cleverly was a typical football coach that you loved but feared too, you know, and he'd actually made Buck shower in PE, and when he didn't want to shower, you know, and he told him to, you know, get undressed and get in the shower, you know, as soon as Buck started taking his shirt off, he seen the whip marks, and the thing of it is, is, you know, he just basically told him, he said, "Your dad will never beat you again.
"I'll make sure of that," you know.
and then that's when Johnny France kind of started the ball rolling to get Buck and Smokie to a safe place.
I was present when the boys were forced to disrobe, and on their legs and their little buttocks were these big whip marks where their dad had beat them.
when I looked at these little boys, I said, "No, we'll have none of that.
I took them to the Shirleys.
they were two frightened little boys, but it wasn't too long before the two boys were just...
they just turned into Shirleys.
my mom had...had just died.
and she was very loving, wasn't she?
Yeah. - She was a very loving lady.
so she became my new mom, and, boy, that was something I really needed.
sleep good?
I did.
they have a wonderful relationship, and she's a guiding force.
may God bless you and watch over you.
there's no sense that, "Okay, you're raised. You're gone.
I mean, she's their mother.
she's truly their mother, and I think Betsy raised something like 23 foster sons.
I mean, all boys, all boys.
when our kids were little, it was like a zoo, and it was every man for himself and survival of the fittest.
my motto that's stood me in good stead is, "Blessed are the flexible, for they shall not get bent out of shape.
my foster dad taught me how to shoe horses.
I was 12 years old.
when I first went to live with them, he told me, "Kid, you might not ever amount to much, but you better learn how to ride a colt and shoe a horse."
and then you'll always be able to eat.
even if you can't get much of a job, you'll always be able to eat.
so he taught me how to shoe a horse over a period of time.
there were so many things that I learned while I was with my foster parents.
when I first got dropped off at the Shirley ranch, I was so terrified of men, and my foster-dad-to-be, he pulled in in the truck, and, gee, he was tall, 6'4," just looked like he was made out of rawhide and barbwire
but he walked right up to me, and he said, "You must be Buck,"
and I shook his hand, but I couldn't even speak.
it's real; you can be so scared that you can't say anything.
no words come out.
I just sat there, and my little knees were just about knocking together.
I was a little guy.
and then he spun around, walked back to the truck, and opened the door, and my heart just stopped.
because it's almost like a colt that's had some trouble.
you don't have to do too much to make them suspicious, just even move in a little bit of a way that they don't understand or can't comprehend, and that quick, they...
they think they need to save themselves.
so when he went back to that truck and opened the door, I didn't know what to do.
scared me to death.
he came back, and he threw me a pair of buckskin gloves.
he said, "Here."
he said, "You're gonna need them,"
and, gee, they were just beautiful, and they fit me perfect.
I was so proud of them.
and he looked over at the ranch truck, and he said, "Get in.
so we got in, and he always had fencing tools in the truck.
so we took off, and we built fence all afternoon, pounding steel posts into rocks and pulling wire, but I wouldn't wear those gloves.
there was just that... that took act of kindness, just giving me something like that.
Oh, gee, it meant so much.
I didn't want to get them all tore up, so I kept them in my pocket, and I just worked with the barbwire with my bare hands.
and he realized that I didn't need someone to just pity me for what I'd been through.
he knew I just needed something to do.
I needed a job to do.
and that's when things started to head in the right direction for me.
so I learned that about the horses years later.
I thought, "Oh, yeah."
that's kind of what Forrest did with me, come to think of it.
you see the expression on that horse?
it moves, but he's crabby.
flagging the tail, it's annoyed.
it's like asking your kid to go take the garbage out.
they take the garbage out, but they flip you the bird on the way out of the room.
it's without respect, and respect isn't fear.
it's acceptance.
he bucks whenever I saddle him...
not when I saddle him but when I get him to go through transitions.
I've never started a colt ever in my life.
I've always been around really well-broken ones.
so this is my first shot at it.
and he's got a little bit of Buck in him.
so you must be Bill.
I am Bill.
that's why I asked Bill Seaton to ride him, 'cause Chief needs a confident rider for that first ride.
I bought Chief about a year and a half ago.
he was one.
he had never had any human contact.
born out in the field, wasn't touched, handled, nothing.
it's just a rodeo and disaster waiting to happen.
it's not his fault.
he's like a kid that just didn't have any good parenting.
he just doesn't know what's to be expected of him.
I want to check your horse out.
if you're gonna do anything shocking, I'd rather you did the shocking stuff right here than when you're on their back.
right here.
step over.
he says, "Well, I prefer you beg me."
not a chance.
there's the good deal offered.
there's not so good a deal.
that's the thing with a horse.
you can't just love on them and buy lots of carrots.
bribery doesn't work with horses.
no different than trying to bribe a kid.
all it does is make a contemptuous, spoiled horse.
but you don't want them afraid of you.
you can be strict, but you don't need to be unfair, and like I say, it's not personal.
I don't feel any different about him than I do my own horse I just stepped off.
we're not mad at you.
one of the biggest challenges of a horseman is, is to be able to control your emotions, because a person might be quick to get all mad.
there you go.
that's better.
let's go this way.
I said that way.
you allow a horse to make mistakes.
the horse will learn from mistakes no different than the human.
but you can't get him to where he dreads making mistakes for fear of what's gonna happen after he does.
sometimes I'll just move this flag around, and I don't want him to be afraid of it.
I'm saying just live with that.
now we'll start again.
there's a change.
Attaboy.
buck says when you start handling horses, your own personal issues start coming out.
and I was so anxious to see the saddle on Chief,
I rushed him to it, and now I've built...
I feel like I've built this fear and this insecurity in him.
but see, I'm an insecure person, so they... horses, they mirror you.
they can't lie.
there. Good boy.
horsemanship, fine horsemanship, becomes a way of life.
it's not about controlling the horses.
it becomes how you treat your spouse, how you treat strangers.
will you give people a chance, just like you give the horses a chance?
it becomes how you discipline your children.
you know, you can discipline and discourage, or you can discipline and encourage.
you can say, "I see you tried that. What do you think you should try instead?'
tentative, but he tried, and I'd pet him with this.
you can just leave him be for a little while.
just kind of hang with him and let that soak in.
that's a more building sort of approach than, "That's wrong. That's wrong. That's wrong."
all right, it's time.
go on out that end. Go into the round corral.
we're gonna go for a little ride here.
how you getting along, Bill? - Great.
looks pretty good.
sure does, doesn't it?
see if you can get on a lope.
good. Well done.
coming through. - There you go.
way to go.
that should have felt pretty good to you, Bill.
it did.
kind of where you end up your ride on a horse is so important, you guys.
it's a little bit like when you guys were younger and you were dating.
that last two minutes of the date can be a real deal breaker.
with these horses, it's the same thing, you know?
you got to quit on a good note.
that was a good day.
all right, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
raspberry and peach cobbler, which would you like?
going for raspberry.
Oh, that one?
Hey, Buck, why don't you do some rope tricks?
this is kind of a tricky one here.
this is the move I used to always do for Mary when I was trying to trap her.
he was just a very ordinary boy, didn't show signs of early genius.
Thanks, Mom.
there was one point he thought maybe his trick roping would be his avenue to success, but when he first saw Ray Hunt doing his thing, he was so fascinated, he focused on that.
pretty much anybody that's been involved in the horse world knows Ray Hunt, and Ray brought this style of horsemanship to the world.
Tom Dorrance was sort of the godfather of all of this.
Tom Dorrance taught Ray Hunt.
ray Hunt taught Buck Brannaman.
that's kind of the lineage, as it were.
I met Ray right after I got out of high school.
one of my teachers told me about this guy that could start a horse and get on him in just a few minutes and ride him around with no bridle on, and I thought, "Right.
I'd grown up on a ranch.
I was pretty punchy.
rode a lot of colts and a pretty fair bronc rider for a kid.
I thought, "Yeah, another song-and-dance man, some horse show dude."
I had an opportunity to go get this cowboying job at a place called Madison River Cattle Company.
they said, "Well, in order for you to get hired, you're gonna have to go talk to the manager, and he's at a Ray Hunt clinic."
and I thought, "Aw, great. Here's this Ray Hunt guy again."
so I go into the fairgrounds, and Sat about as far away as I could so that I could show that I was not interested in this.
and then in came Ray Hunt.
I saw him do more things with a horse in a couple of minutes than I'd ever figured anybody could do with a horse.
he worked with a colt that was pretty touchy, and I had been around enough to know what a touchy horse looked like.
you could tell the horse truly understood what he was expecting of her.
he could take those feet anywhere he wanted.
they were his feet.
it was just an extension of him.
it was like a beautiful dance.
I took right to it as soon as I saw it.
I thought, "I don't even know what it is, but whatever it is, I need this."
so that was the beginning for me.
I went to Ray's clinics, if not every week, every other week, for the next four or five years.
I was right down in the arena hanging over the round corral watching this guy lift a rein or move a foot.
I might not have known all what he was doing, but I was seeing it.
we got to be very close, and even though he said it wasn't that important that I pleased him or that people pleased him.
I looked for his approval, you know, the same way you would a father figure.
and later on, when Ray passed away, I shed way more tears for him than I ever did for my dad.
now, you guys don't have to ride like Ray Hunt or Tom Dorrance, but that's the choice I made.
first clinic I ever did, I probably wasn't, you know, a real effective teacher.
I was a pretty decent hand by then.
I could get a little bit of stuff done with a horse.
but I'm sure I just sounded like I was parodying Ray Hunt.
I didn't have anything original of my own to really talk about, and I was so introverted at the time, and I felt so uncomfortable.
I committed right then that I was gonna do enough little local clinics to conquer that.
buck has worked so hard to overcome his shyness.
the clinics were so small when he first started, he would offer to haul the horses for free just to get 'em to go to his clinic.
and he couldn't have eye contact with you.
I mean, he was very shy, and to see him work that hard to overcome that...
and I think it amazes him to this day that people want to even listen to what he has to say.
ray used to say that he thought horsemen were born, but an average person can be extraordinary at this.
but if you don't have any guts, if you don't have any try, you'd be damn lucky to be ordinary.
you're gonna find out what it's like to actually use a horse and how nice they can be when they get used.
to work a horse properly on a cow, that's the coolest feeling there is.
let the games begin.
I want you to be able to learn things and do things in real life if you were on a ranch where you had a job to do.
it's one turn and then a race.
one turn and then a race.
give him a job.
figure out how to build on the horse's pride.
make him feel good about himself.
and I wasn't just talking about the horse.
Reata, that's good.
nice, nice.
Mary.
as long as you can stay between your cow and the herd, you're in charge.
dang, out. I'm out.
see what happens when you're married to him?
Britt, you're up.
go move that cow.
there's really nothing more fun than chasing cows at top speed and just trying to react.
that's crazy fun, but that's not really what you're supposed to do.
so it's this constant battle to bring it back to some place that's controlled.
stop.
see, you turned without stopping.
you know, that's the other half of why this is a really interesting thing, 'cause it carries over into every other aspect of your life, and I think it's made me a more resourceful and balanced human being on top of just less likely to get killed on a horse.
I love working cattle with my dressage horses.
I think it's fabulous for them, because dressage is a sport where there are really fine ballet-type movements that you're asking the horse to do.
it gives meaning and purpose to the dressage work, and then when you take that purpose back into the dressage ring, the horse says, "I'm practicing working cows,"
and it makes sense to the horse, and then he will do it with a greater joy, because it has meaning to him.
it's not simply an exercise.
and I think that dressage work gives the cow horse skills that even cowboys could use.
there you go.
horses get discouraged by riders who shut the doors, and Buck's really good at opening doors.
and you get to artwork or anything else that you do, you start to look at it for the open doors, and then you learn how to walk through those.
you guys want to throw a few heel shots?
I knew that Buck was really a special guy, and because of his background, which I learned about, and the abuse that he had suffered as a kid, it was even more impressive that he could come through that abuse and, rather than repeating it, that he went the other way and decided, "I'm not gonna have that in my life."
bill, I'll start with you first.
what's your stage name?
Smokie Brannaman. - Smokie Brannaman.
and how about you, Dan? What's your stage name?
they call me Buckshot, and I'm seven years old.
well, who taught you to perform?
our father did.
and that's Ace Brannaman, right?
did he ever do this type of thing?
was he... did he ever do...
the way my dad treated me when I was little, the way he approached us as kids...
we've arranged a short demonstration, right, fellas?
I wouldn't attribute any of my positive virtues to my dad in any way whatsoever.
I know you're not supposed to hate anybody, but the hurt that he caused me, I never really got over it.
so I live in the moment.
I like to live in the moment.
you worry about yesterday or last week or 20 years ago, it's not gonna work out too good for you.
you can't live in two places at once.
you know, I mean, you never forget, but you don't have to keep living in the past.
I mean, there's a whole bunch of things I learned from all the dark stuff that happened to me.
there's a hell of a lot of things I learned.
now, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anybody, but it made me what I am.
Yeah, it got a little warm there for a while today, didn't it?
thank goodness my daughter...
she's never gone through anything like that, and now she's almost grown up, so...
you can just saddle them inside the round corral.
I think if a kid is living in an environment like I was when I was little, sometimes the way you protect yourself is, you just really don't communicate with anybody, and you try your best not to be noticed, and you just sort of withdraw, and you'll see a horse sometimes that they've been mashed on by somebody to where you just look in their eyes, and they look like they're dead.
yet that's the time when you try to encourage your kid to be outgoing and gregarious and be able to talk to not only other kids but adults.
then just see if you can lope him right out of his tracks, 'cause that's what you might have to do if you're gonna jump out of your tracks on a cow or something.
you know what I mean? There.
he got it.
he kind of got it done in spite of you, didn't he?
dang it.
we'll make a cowgirl out of you yet.
you're only doing this so you can laugh.
Reata and I are an awful lot alike.
thank goodness she kind of has her mother's looks.
mentally, she's a lot like I am.
you know, Mary'll say, sometimes in frustration, "She's just like you,"
and I think, "What's the downside to that?"
but she may not be seeing it just that way at the time.
and I look at her and the way she's developed, and I think, "I probably could have been that way when I was her age.
that was in there all the while.
do it again.
there.
that was a little better.
Yeah, I could feel it.
buck, either before you get settled or when you get settled, you signed these books last year, and I need a translation.
it's Spanish or Latin.
Latin.
gentle in what you do, firm in how you do it.
Yep. - Good words.
how are you, Charlene? Nice to see you.
it's good to see you.
I wanted to tell you I was all signed up to ride with you, and a couple of weeks before the clinic, I found out I'm having a baby.
well, all right. - Good for you.
I always learn even when I'm watching.
good, all right.
okay, you guys can come on over near the round corral here where you can get a good chance to see.
I'll work with this one first here.
evidently he's a little naughty.
I guess you can see a little disrespect there, huh?
he had to come up and stick his nose right in my face.
so I'll work with him, and we'll see the same things on about all the colts, but...
Dan?
this guy's a paint, and he was an orphan as a baby, and he was oxygen-deprived, apparently.
Dan, do you want to...
which way do you guys want to bring him in?
I'm gonna talk to Buck, see if he wants him or not.
he may want to...
cause that horse might hold up the whole progress of the whole class.
so wait until noon.
so he might want to wait until, yeah, when it's convenient for Buck.
maybe even after the whole deal. I don't know.
I think we have a problem child we have to work yet.
all right, you can bring that one on in, Dan.
they make it sound like they're bringing in a Siberian tiger.
was he hard to catch even in the trailer, Dan?
he just kind of wanted to be a little aggressive in there.
bite maybe. - Uh-huh.
just a lot of threatening, you know?
how old is he?
he's three.
Uh-huh, how much have you worked with him?
I got my back broken in two places.
so he has not been handled.
so he was more or less raised like an orphan.
Yeah.
those can be the worst kind.
the orphans are always the worst, 'cause they don't learn anything about respect that they would have learned from their mother or from other horses.
they don't respect anything or anybody.
you know, people thought I should put him down.
they thought maybe he had some brain damage.
he's extremely dangerous, and he attacks cars.
I'm sure you're anxious to get that one in here, Dan.
don't get hit.
step in behind him there.
when he was an orphan, I didn't have a barn, 'cause my house burned down, and my barn burned down.
so I raised him...
it was cool, so I raised him in the house.
it was cold, and l...
so I bottle-fed him every couple of hours.
and l... how do you say it... potty-trained him.
it started out a good relationship.
it's just, somebody else has to come in and help me.
he's different.
and he's a stud too?
Yeah, I'd do that the sooner, the better.
I mean, it looks to me like the last thing you need is a damn stud.
if you're gonna have one, a lot of you guys, you just as well get you a grizzly bear, an orangutan.
I've known Buck for over 20 years, and I've seen one other horse besides Kelly, a stallion, that stands out, but I've never ever witnessed anything quite like that, that dangerous and unpredictable.
is somebody planning on trimming his feet someday?
Yeah. - Any shoers here?
come on, you cowards.
you want to shoe him right now, or would you rather I got him a little better?
you're booked.
cause Dan's gonna saddle him and ride him around here.
a lot of you that don't understand much about a rope, you'll find out I can stop him, and that's gonna come in handy for you, Dan.
when you're on him, you're gonna be really glad that I can stop him, once you understand how much more control I have by hind foot than I would by a halter on his head.
you already know you can't control him with a halter on his head, 'cause he's been chewing on people and has already been aggressive and wanting to attack people.
Hey, I want you guys to understand.
you can't hold it against him for kind of how his life has been.
little bit, he'll lead soft.
okay, Dan, you can come on in.
we're just gonna kind of love on him for right now.
you just kind of ease up beside him and just pet him.
come on over with your blanket.
you'll just go up and rub him.
Yeah, good.
good. Go get your saddle.
and you kind of... while his frame of mind is kind of humble like that, you can cuddle him and kind of love on him too, so just pet him on the hind leg.
now just see if you can just gently pick up the hoof.
that's the way.
there you go.
you can go around the front.
rub him on his face there when he's being a good guy.
watch him, though.
block him when he wants to bite you, block, block.
that's the biggest thing is, nobody's ever blocked him.
we had to put up a sign that says "attack horse," because if somebody did walk into the pasture, he would have taken 'em out.
one time, some people started teasing him, and I went up to him about 12 feet away in this golf cart, thinking that would bring him away from the fence, and instead he looked back at me, pinned his ears, ducked his head, and did that aggressive horse behavior and came right at me.
going, striking, feet, everything, and he pretty much came up over the golf cart and nailed me.
now go for a little walk with him.
now we're gonna stop him.
pet him.
you're the good cop there, Dan.
you just love on him.
rub him down that hind leg.
looks good.
just get on him like he's Grandma's horse.
all right.
pick your lead rope up so it's not dragging there.
so you can kind of bend him if you need to, to the left.
pet him.
you just rub him all over like you're just totally in love.
there you go.
okay, walk off again.
Yeah, go ahead, just say, "Come on. Let's go, Yeller."
there you go.
pet him. Pet him when he goes, see.
you got to remember that. Now maybe we can lope him.
you got an opportunity.
there. Go ahead.
go on. Pet him. Pet him.
rub him on the butt.
we don't want him to think every time he feels anything back there, he's just gonna get whacked.
good job. I'm gonna stop you now.
okay, you can step off him nice and clean.
this isn't open for discussion.
at this point, Dan is the only one permitted to lead this horse anywhere, and then later on, maybe a little short evening session, you can work him on the end of your lead rope in here when it's just you and him by yourself.
I was really embarrassed, because he said nobody should have a stud horse, and I'm thinking, "God, if he only knew I had a whole pasture full at home, that I have."
and then he said not letting him get his head over so he can bite, well, it's healed up pretty well, but I'm gonna have that the rest of my life, yeah.
you know, I have thousands of horses under my belt and lots of experience.
and, hell, the safest place around this son of a bitch is on him.
you felt fine when you were on him.
but around him on the ground, he's treacherous 'cause of what he's, you know, gotten to be.
and he could hurt Dan or me or you or anybody else just in being spoiled, and he doesn't want to be that way, but he doesn't know any other way to be.
he's as close to having been turned into a predator as you're gonna find.
cause he's... he's been wrecked.
I'd want to give the older horses a chance to get him some manners.
he's run with some studs, and they take...
you're nuts for having that many studs running together, lady; I'm telling you that.
most people don't need studs, and for God's sake, they don't need 18 of them.
I don't know what you're trying to prove.
and if you got a lot going on in your life, probably a lot of it's a lot bigger story than this horse.
Yeah.
you ought to be a SEAL team member or something, as much risk as you like to take.
why don't you learn how to enjoy your life?
life's too damn short.
this horse tells me quite a bit about you.
so this is just an amplified situation of what is.
maybe there... maybe there are some things for you to learn about you that maybe the horses is gonna be the only damn way you're gonna learn it, 'cause you might not listen to somebody else.
well, that's all right.
sometimes I don't either, and I should.
ask my wife.
I love the horses, but I have a responsibility to my fellow human too, you know, if I think maybe you might do something to get yourself hurt and you don't even see it coming, if I see it coming, l...
you know, I have a moral obligation to say you're in big trouble here.
sound fair?
okay.
he's right.
I mean, he's right.
l... you know?
he's right, and I'm not...
it's not just the horse.
he's... he's right about my life.
Yeah.
so, Dan, if you feel safer just roping him, can you rope him?
I need to get my horse kind of warmed up a little bit.
Dan, Dan, Dan!
watch out! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
he's a psychopath.
get out. You're bleeding really bad.
he got you in the head. Get out.
that's it.
you're done.
you got it?
here, Dan. Hop down.
just hop down.
well, I need to stay here.
I know. I know. I know.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Dan, you've got a huge hole.
you need sutures.
it's a huge hole.
that's pretty bad, and you always carry something with you just in case.
I'm gonna have to put him down.
you want a ride in and throw some stitches on?
no, no. - Not your chin.
Oh, look what he did to my hat.
he bit you.
he bit you in the head?
holy shit.
then he knocked me over.
okay, go sit down in my mom's car right there.
Why?
cause I'm taking you to get stitches.
it's deep.
you could see the bone in the...
big fuss they make about it, just get it cleaned and closed.
Mr. Brannaman, you need to talk a little sense into Dan, and I figure you're probably the only one that can do it.
dang.
about the third time I got that saddle blanket up over his back, boy, I didn't even see him, man.
he hit me with his teeth, boy, and knocked me flat.
get it stitched up.
what you gonna do?
we're gonna have to put him down.
I won't give him off to somebody who's gonna beat him to a pulp with a 2x4.
it's not something you do, and he... he's dangerous.
I'm gonna put him down, and that's the most humane thing to do for him.
Yeah.
get out of there.
Dan.
Dan, Dan, Dan! - Hey!
Yeah, do not get close to him.
step back away from him.
is Buck coming? - Yeah.
please step back away from him.
I was just backing up to get the shot.
how are they gonna get him in that trailer?
come on, Kel.
come on, Kel. Come on.
just sit still.
just wait.
come on, Kel. Come on, Kel.
come on. Up.
sit still. Just sit still.
just sit still.
just don't do anything.
okay, we'll see if you have any questions here.
well, I'll talk to you right now.
the colt, when it was born, was not breathing when they got to it, and they didn't know for how long.
so the vet even figured that the horse had been oxygen-deprived for quite a long period of time, but he still could have made it in spite of his handicap that he was born with.
he could have made it.
if you just would treat this as if that horse, because of the oxygen deprivation, had some sort of a learning disability.
well, number one, they should have worked with him like you might work with a disabled child and said, "Look, you might need a little bit of extra education because of where you're coming from."
so you could have taken that disabled child and turned him into something of value to himself and everyone else, and he may have ended up just a kind, nice little horse that didn't have a lot to offer mentally but was just kind of okay with people, and he might have packed someone around.
he might have been the absolute opposite of what he is.
but you know damn good and well, she would go home, and she would either get hurt, get killed, or someone else would get hurt that was totally innocent.
the human failed that horse.
the human is that X factor.
that horse is a mirror.
all your horses are a mirror to your soul.
and sometimes you might not like what you see in the mirror.
sometimes you will.
what were you thinking when you were just being so kind and patient with that horse to get him in there instead of just, "You're no good," shut the door, and go?
to have contempt for the horse never would even occur to me.
that's not...
maybe... maybe 30 years ago, it would have, maybe.
one of the biggest challenges of a horseman is, is to be able to control your emotions, and it's a...
you know, probably more of a challenge for me...
has been, you know, not so much now, but it has been...
because my dad had a violent temper.
he was a terrifying person.
so that kind of followed me around a little bit, thinking, "Am I gonna be just like that old fart," you know?
no.
no, you got a choice.
you can make choices.
you can't blame the whole damn thing on somebody else.
and, you know, I can't help but think that all you guys here, when you have a youngster, that you're gonna be thinking, "Hoo, hoo, hoo, I've got some responsibility."
I'm gonna take care of things and try to make this "as good a life for him as I can" and not let things get out of hand and teach him something," I hope.
I hope.
so we're headed from Chico to Red Bluff to the stock horse and ranch roping contest there.
the Californios is the deal every year in Red Bluff.
buckaroo, vaquero-style roping, this is it.
Reata's doing the kid's class.
they call it the heritage class.
she's really looking forward to that, and this'll be her last year to do the kid's class.
then she'll be too old.
the Californios is one of the highlights of my dad's season, 'cause he's been on the road traveling, living in his horse trailer, meeting a bunch of new people, having to memorize their names.
so I think it is definitely one of his highlights.
she won this event last year, Reata Brannaman, and she's showing a lot of these guys how to throw that thing.
that's about the most fun for me is out there roping with my daughter.
she wants to be...
she emulates everything her dad does.
she wants to be just like him.
she's her father's daughter.
we did teach her how to ride, but it was already in her.
she could ride from the very beginning.
I mean, the very first time I ever watched her rope,
I thought, "Who's been teaching you?"
okay, we're good to go.
Reata Brannaman and her lovely assistant.
Yes, lovely assistant.
the way this works is, they've got seven minutes to do this.
Yeah! Yeah!
gee, she's a handy kid.
Outropes most men now.
there'll come a time when she'll be beating me, and that'll be fine.
it'll be time to turn it over to her.
then I'll just sit around in the grandstands and talk about all the stuff I used to be.
but hopefully that'll be about another 30, 40 years.
people say they're too old when they're, like, 40, and you think, "Shut up. Too old."
bill Dorrance was roping when he was 94.
that's how I want to be when I grow up, if I ever do.
Oh, it's always neat to see them after I've been gone for a long time, yeah.
but it's always hard to leave too.
you know, once you're around them for a few days, kind of start getting used to being around them.
then you go back to your life of solitude.
so I'm still on the move.
I'm getting better, because I'm still studying.
I still want to be a better horseman.
I've learned so many things, and I thought originally I was just gonna be there to figure out how to get a colt started and figure out how to be a little better cowboy.
that's what I thought it was about.
come to find out, that wasn't what it was about at all.
out of a group like this, there might be some who become artists, where you become creative, and you use your imagination.
now, that was a thing of beauty.
you look like one mind and one body.
if you got a taste of it, if you got a taste of what I'm talking about, you couldn't get enough of it.
you'd rather do that than eat.
you may spend your whole life chasing that, and that's possible, but it's a good thing to chase.
this is Buck's favorite joke.
it's a pirate scene, and the guy up in the crow's nest says, "One enemy ship coming on the horizon!"
and the captain says, "Quick, bring me my red shirt, because if I get wounded in battle, the blood won't show, and my men will fight on."
so they had the battle, and after a bit, the guy in the crow's nest says, "Ten enemy ships on the horizon!"
and the captain says, "Quick, bring me my brown pants!"

Roger, five echo.
watch our 6: 00.
Semper.

we're clear.
they're in there, kids,
I promise.
now, go in there and try and find them.
they're dressed just like me.
ready? Go! Come on!
let's go, let's go, let's go!
man down! Man down!
he's not in his cammies.
that's his dress blue delta uniform.
off-duty clothes.
he's not part of the demonstration drills going on today.
single stab wound to the chest.
one drop of blood on the sleeve.
you know, he's off the path.
this doesn't look like a shortcut, so I'm guessing that he was dragged into the bushes.
this marine's seen action.
global war on terrorism service medal, navy and marine corps achievement medal with a combat "v,"
combat action ribbon, Iraqi campaign ribbon.
he's been overseas.
and this is how we welcome him home.
ambush in central park.
something's not right.
the shirt is tucked in.
his pants are creased.
there's no abrasions on his knuckles.
no dirt under his nails.
evidence there wasn't a struggle.
corporal Price was a decorated marine trained in combat.
so why didn't he fight for his life?
out here in the fields
I fought for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight to prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven,
found blood up on the path, Mac.
gravitational drops.
body temp's 82. 1.
he's been dead roughly 11 hours.
T.O.D. Around midnight.
more blood.
directional drops leading away from the body.
swept the area twice, Mac.
killer didn't dump the weapon.
unfortunately, lowlifes know it's fleet week, also.
servicemen are easy targets 'cause they're easy to spot.
uniform isn't a bull's-eye.
it's a badge of honor.
once a marine, always a marine.
if you attack one of us, you've attacked us all.
C.O.D. Was straightforward:
transection of the vena cava.
is there anything distinct about the wound that would help narrow down or specify a weapon?
wound is average in every way.
single-edged blade about three to four inches long.
there is, however, extensive bruising.
that's strange.
nothing on the scene or on his clothing to suggest he defended himself.
Oh, no.
that's because, um...
the bruising happened well before he died.
see that?
Yeah.
already a yellowish color.
few days old.
he fought with someone, and it was one hell of a battle.
sir, I'm captain flood.
I have orders to assist you in any way possible.
detective Mac Taylor.
battalion co tell you why I'm here?
Yes, sir.
corporal Price was a member of my platoon.
he's been murdered.
you were his company commander?
Yes, sir, I was.
his body was severely bruised.
his injuries are inconsistent with his murder.
I believe that his bruises were a result of your orders.
put him in the bull-ring, didn't you?
you understand, in combat, facing the enemy, a marine needs to know that the man next to him will do his job, and do it well.
a corps of well-trained marines will kick the crap out of anyone else in the world, but the platoon is only as strong at its weakest link.
corporal Price was the weak link in your platoon, so you put him in the bull ring to toughen him up.
sir, I put corporal Price in the ring for the betterment of the platoon.
training against him made everyone stronger.
corporal Price was an outstanding marine.
there's not a devil dog he served with that would wish him harm.
what about out there in the city?
he know anyone?
not that i'm aware of, sir.
I'll need to know everywhere the platoon went.
well, that's the thing, sir.
corporal Price didn't come with us.
he said that there was something he needed to take care of alone.
Hey.
what do we got?
windows slightly cracked open, blacked out, bubbling paint...
and this.
victim's unrecognizable.
soot stains on the roof and outside the door, but the engine compartment is undamaged.
think it's a torch job?
fire burned hot and fast.
there's no water damage or fire extinguisher residue.
why didn't the fire department put this out?
no need.
windows weren't open enough to sustain the flames.
once the oxygen burned out, the fire extinguished itself.
burn patterns are contained in the front seat.
the rest of the vehicle just has surface charring.
this wasn't about torching a car.
it was about hiding a body.
ran the plate.
no alarm on the car.
hasn't been reported stolen.
registered owner is a Charles Wright.
I can assure you this is not Charles Wright.
in fact it's not even a "he."
the fire destroyed the external tissu, but the internal organs were somewhat preserved.
see what I mean?
two circular bodies: Ovaries.
triangular organ here: Uterus.
victim's definitely female.
did she suffer?
Yeah, but not because of the fire.
no smoke in the lungs.
C O.D. Was blunt force trauma.
your killer showed no mercy.
Oh! Multiple fractures: Frontal bone, zygomatic arch...
wow, left ulna.
ribs nine and ten on the right side.
she was beaten to death.
sexual assault?
collected a kit, but any physical evidence was likely destroyed by the fire.
any leads on her name?
fingerprints were burned off.
d dental comparisons only help to confirm identity, not tablish it.
as of now, she's jane doe.
means I need to bring her back to life.
Hey. - Hey.
found a strange indentation in the armrest.
and on the window...
I found a print.
it's an ear.
a left ear. - Huh.
whoever it belongs to was facing the wrong way in the passenger seat.
right.
and it looks the wrong size to be the victim's.
I think it's the killer's.
ear print is great evidence, it's just too bad it's not searchable in any database.
which is where this comes in.
Charles Wright, our R. O.
is alive and well.
in fact, he just called in and reported that he witnessed his Cadillac being stolen outside of his brownstone an hour ago.
that's impossible.
we found the car three hours ago downtown already burned to a crisp.
there's no way he saw it being stolen.
exactly.
why is Charles Wright lying?
that's a sketch of the female victim from the burned Cadillac.
this is a fastscan image of the face.
a fastscan is a digital representation.
the resulting facial reconstruction isn't 100% accurate.
that's a scaled photo of the skull.
this is a photo I pulled from the official NYPD file.
it's her, Mac.
we're going to get the son of a bitch who did this.
she was murdered in your car, Mr. Wright.
I don't know anything about a murder.
that girl burned beyond recognition in your front seat?
she was a detective.
this is a mistake.
I didn't ... I didn't hurt anyone, okay?
I didn't burn my car.
you're lying!
all the evidence points back to you, Charles.
I want the truth.
tell me right now!
I can't.
it'll ruin me.
I don't care.
this isn't about you.
it's about her.
I cheated, okay?!
I cheated on my wife.
not with her, the detective.
I don't know her.
then with who?
a prostitute.
a man.
I meet him once a week...
after work, at this cheap hotel off 11th avenue.
I park around the corner.
I saw him last night late.
afterwards, I went to my car, but it was stolen, it was gone.
okay, I didn't know what to do.
if this got out, if my wife knew...
I took a cab home,
I went to sleep, and today I acted like my car was stolen from in front of my house so my wife wouldn't know where I'd been.
but I had nothing to do with a murder or a fire.
you have to believe me.
no, I don't.
listen, whatever I have to do to prove I didn't do this, I will.
DNA, fingerprints, anything.
for now I want your prints, starting with your left ear.
mac, is this him?
this is the scumbag that killed Aiden?!
Danny, get out of here.
just let me talk to him. Oh!
I will get him to crack,
I promise you that.
how?
by tuning him up?
Stella's got the case, she knows what to do.
this is Aiden.
she's one of our own, Mac.
that's why we can't make any mistakes.
we do this one by the book.
understand?
you're right. I just wanted to help.
I know.
me, too.
the accelerant used to torch charles wright's car was lighter fluid.
easily purchased.
untraceable.
Yeah, unfortunately.
how well did you know her?
well enough to know that if one of us had been killed, she wouldn't sleep until the killer was caught.
is that the indentation I found on the passenger armrest? - Yeah.
and I have no idea what it is.
Hey. - Hey, man.
you hear anything on your end regarding Aiden's case?
nothing new.
just rumors.
really.
we were supposed to have dinner this weekend.
actually, I was hoping she'd offer to cook.
she knew her way around the kitchen?
she made phenomenal chicken parm.
all right, listen to me.
I reached out to Corporal Price's family, he had an older brother.
now as far as his brother knew, our vic didn't know anyone in the city.
Really?
cause I found this...
in his pocket.
why wasn't he wearing it?
I don't know.
check out the back.
I'm your girl. Ellie.
I spoke to every marine in Price's platoon.
no one mentioned a girlfriend.
that's just one of the many mysteries, Flack.
check this out.
exhibit a
stain on his pants.
it's not blood. - No.
it's not biological at all.
I don't know what it is.
same as this.
shoes immaculately polished.
tells us the scuff mark's out of place.
Yeah.
not as out of place as this.
a lima bean? - Yeah, a lima bean.
dried. One of them.
found it in his pocket.
what the hell's that about?
depends. Could be nothing.
could be a major break in the case.
find any cash in his pockets?
nothing.
pockets weren't turned out, so I don't think this was a robbery.
I don't think it was a robbery,
I think it was a fleecing.
yo, dude, you're dead wrong you'll never have the skills like mine
I have the real tight rhymes...
come on, now, follow it, follow it.
don't blink.
here we go.
okay, my man, where's the bean?
that one.
damn, man.
service trained you well.
one more time.
give a brother a chance to win back some of his green.
double or nothing?
five will get you ten.
ten will get you 20.
20 will get you plenty.
go time, sailor.
Where's it at?
right there.
snap! Told ya!
don't blink.
who's next?
who wants to play?
I'm feeling lucky.
rondo's closed.
that's a hell of a shiner you got.
dangers of doing business.
dangers of scamming people, you mean.
Hey, they put up their own money.
I ain't picking their pockets.
Yeah, but you don't play fair, either.
why you hassling me?
because of a marine we found dead in central park.
I'll lower my flag to half mast.
you know what?
don't you test me today, Rondo,
I'm telling you right now, 'cause you won't win.
what, you sticking this on me?
I don't know any marines.
well, the lack of cash...
and the lima bean in his pocket would beg to differ.
and how does that single me out?
well, it's fleet week, Rondo.
the city's flush with money and your shell game, it's a dying art.
there's only a few crews still running it in the city.
and you're the only guy that got busted that uses a lima bean as a mark.
so I'm thinking you scammed him, maybe he popped you in the eye and that pissed you off.
so you followed him into central park, ambushed him.
you sure?
corporal Trevor Price.
take a good look.
that guy.
man, I didn't hurt him.
that brother was cool.
okay, sailor.
Where's it at?
there.
he lost.
he took the bean as a souvenir.
said "only in new york."
lesson learned.
walked off.
that was around 9: 00 last night.
never saw him again.
how'd you get the shiner?
the rest of the fleet wasn't so forgiving.
the next mark tagged me after I took him for two bills.
I didn't kill that marine.
all right, well, then you won't mind giving me a dna sample then, right?
made the notification to Aiden's father.
he's going to take care of the arrangements, keep us informed about dates and times.
we get a match?
not even close.
the ear print left on the car window definitely did not belong to Charles Wright.
doesn't clear him.
still could've killed Aiden.
when was the last time you saw her?
we spoke on the phone about a month ago.
you?
just last week, by chance.
Hey! - How are you?
I'm great. - How are you?
I'm good.
I'm real good.
I'm working on my P.I. License. - Good.
Yeah, and another side project that I've been waiting to finish for a long time now.
you want to sit down?
you have a minute?
Oh, not really.
I have someplace to be.
but when it all comes together, you'll be the first call I make.
I promise.
take care. - Take care.
she never called.
I never called her, either.
all I had to do was pick up the phone.
we have no idea what was going on in her life.
let's go find out.
Hey, Mac, come take a look at this.
it's D. J. Pratt.
she was working her own investigation.
this photo was taken two days ago.
Pratt's attorney claimed NYPD was following his client.
my client, Mr. Pratt, says he's being harassed by someone in your department.
D. J. Pratt is a suspect in an ongoing criminal investigation, but I don't have anyone assigned to surveillance at this time.
we were never following him.
no, but Aiden was.
mac, what if pratt found out it was her?
suddenly, the hunted became the hunter?
D. J. Pratt killed Aiden.
NYPD, what a surprise.
was my lawyer not clear with you, Detective Taylor?
stop harassing me.
or do I have to file a suit?
we know the truth, Pratt.
you're not going to slip through the cracks this time.
what are you accusing me of now?
murder.
I didn't kill anyone.
we're going to get you, I promise.
sounds like a threat to me.
I'm calling my lawyer.
good, make sure he starts preparing your defense for trial.
Hey, Pratt?
for real?
looks that way.
you didn't lock him up?
mac, he's dirty.
we're letting this guy walk around the city like he owns the place.
look, I know you're upset, and I am, too, but our hands are tied right now.
his lawyer's watching every move we make.
I don't want to make a mistake and have him get off on a technicality.
all right, so until we have the evidence to charge Pratt, the law's going to protect him.
where we at with Rondo?
he scammed Corporal Price, took his cash, but not his life.
rondo's DNA doesn't match the sample from the vic's shirtsleeve.
what about corporal Price's footlocker?
where is it?
that's in transit.
it'll be here soon.
I do have a lead.
the vic was playing a shell game in times square at 9: 00 P. M.
and was found dead in central park at midnight.
so where was he in between?
exactly.
I found a scuff on the vic's shoe and it had traces of ammonia, paraffin, naphthene and aromatic hydrocarbons.
they're all components of a stoddard solvent.
a metal polisher.
I'm thinking brass cleaner, because I also found a stain on his pants -- beer, but not from your average six pack
which had traces of propylene glycol and isoamyl acetate.
artificial flavoring.
banana, to be exact.
okay, so we got brass cleaner and banana beer.
you're thinking specialty bar.
boom.
and I found one, the yard bar, three blocks from where Corporal Price was murdered.
their microbrew specialty is banana ale.
Flack's already there.
my name's Detective Flack.
can I ask you a couple questions about a customer who was in here last night?
sure, but I won't be much help
I was off last night.
Damon, can you take this?
I'm sorry.
what's going on?
remember this guy from last night sometime between 9: 00 and midnight?
Yeah, the marine, Price.
fleet week's big for the strip clubs.
we don't see any troops up here, so when he came in, people noticed.
come on in.
welcome home, son.
come and have a beer.
beers are free for you tonight.
here, take my seat.
an impromptu welcome home party.
the guy's putting his ass on the line for us, the least we could do is show him we appreciate it.
how long did he stay?
until 11: 30 or so.
said he was looking for someone and he needed to find her.
her?
Yeah, girl named Ellie.
he thought she worked here.
it's what brought him up this way in the first place.
but she doesn't work here?
no.
I've been here three years.
last night's the first time i've ever even heard the name.
Thanks.
D. J. Pratt is the prime suspect in aiden's murder, which means Charles Wright might have been telling the truth about his car being stolen.
I don't get it.
D. J. Pratt is a rapist.
why is he stealing cars?
I don't know, but if we can tie him into the car theft, we can put him at the murder scene and that's all I can think about.
Danny talks about her a lot...
they were close.
I wish I could have met her.
you would have liked her.
I got some scratch marks here.
it was a slim jim.
tells us how they broke into the car.
doesn't tell us who.
well, this might.
there are tool marks in the ignition switch.
that's not all he left behind.
our thief popped the ignition with a paint-speckled tool when Mac and I confronted pratt this afternoon, he'd been painting an apartment.
well, that makes these flecks pretty solid evidence.
Mack, so Flack checked in.
seems the vic went down to the yard bar to meet a girl named Ellie.
I'm thinking it has something to do with the watch I found in his pocket.
the problem is, Ellie wasn't there.
so he left to look for her.
that was 11: 30.
a half hour later he's dead.
any leads on Ellie?
Flack's following up.
right now she's a ghost.
amylase test came back on the blood from the shirtsleeve.
it's positive for mucus.
the killer's nose bled on Corporal Price's sleeve.
so how does that get us closer to knowing who the killer is?
price had been through the bullring.
he knew how to fight, he knew how to defend himself.
I'm glad you're here.
I want to try something.
you be the killer.
I'll be Corporal Price.
I want you to come at me like you're going to stab me in the chest overhand.
ready?
okay, disarmed you of the weapon, made sure you can't pick it back up.
Yes, you did, with a blow to my elbow.
all right, right around the joint, most likely causing a dislocation.
followed by an elbow to the nose, breaking it...
and finishing with a figure-four rear choke.
and my busted nose is going to cause me to bleed, explain the blood on the sleeve.
corporal Price was an experienced marine.
he would have no problem overtaking a civilian attacker.
which is why there was no evidence of a struggle.
he also would have held that choke hold for at least 13 seconds
cutting off blood flow until the attacker passed out.
that doesn't work, because if he was out cold, how's he gonna stab the vic in the chest?
means there was a second attacker.
one Corporal Price never saw coming.
one of the attackers has a severely-damaged right elbow and a broken nose.
two injuries that do not heal on their own.
no.
so one of our suspects is in the hospital.
find him.
Hey, Lindsay, what do we got?
well, the top spectrum has a chemical id of the paint I pulled out of the ignition system, and the bottom spectrum is the chemical id of the paint taken from the apartment D.J. Pratt was painting.
he stole the car.
we got him.
not exactly.
the name of the color is Navajo white.
it's extremely popular.
it's used in almost every building in the city.
look, you know Pratt did it, I know Pratt did it.
but I don't think this paint is strong enough evidence to prove it.
we're exactly where Aiden was eight months ago
staring the criminal right in the face and powerless to bring him to justice.
how could this have happened, Mac?
Aiden was smart.
she was a great cop.
she knew Pratt was dangerous.
why would she get so close, following him, all these photos?
this case haunted her.
Aiden sacrificed her career trying to get D. J. Pratt.
wait a minute.
she didn't make a mistake.
she made a choice.
this woman lived in the building that Pratt was painting.
Aiden would know if she fits Pratt's M.O.
Pratt used this blonde to lure Aiden into his trap.
what she didn't know is that he set the whole thing up.
Hey! Hey! Wait up!
he was targeting Aiden.
he stole Charles Wright's car with the intention of killing her in it.
mac, that indentation on the armrest of the burned-out car?
bite mark.
Pratt's?
that's what I'd hoped for, but no go.
bite belongs to Aiden.
I casted the maxillary dentition.
perfect match.
she bit down on the armrest during the attack.
Aiden left us everything we need to nail D. J. Pratt for good.
his name's Keith Gale.
he's got a busted right elbow, fractured nose and a bruised trachea, just like you thought.
when was he admitted?
last night.
12: 10 A. M.
Flack, that's ten minutes after our estimated time of death.
the crime scene's three blocks from here.
it's walking distance.
this guy was unconscious.
he didn't get up and walk here on his own.
EMT respond to a call in the park?
no, he was dropped off.
by who?
his wife.
the second attacker.
Where's the knife, Stacey?
this wasn't my fault.
Oh, yes, it was. - Look at me.
Where's the knife?
I dropped it in the gutter.
at 72nd and fifth avenue.
look, you gotta understand, this was an accident.
I didn't have a choice.
Yeah, you had plenty of choices.
you know, you just chose the wrong one.
your husband abuses you, and you filed, how many, four complaints in the last year alone.
and each time you dropped the charges.
look, sometimes, when keith gets drunk, he loses his temper.
but he always apologizes.
I mean, he loves me.
right, right.
this is how he shows you?
by squeezing your arms so tight that you bruise?
by, by splitting your lip?
by punching you in the jaw?
you don't know Keith.
Oh, I do know Keith.
last night, you two walking in central park.
probably had a few drinks.
he had one too many, again, and his demons come out -- on you.
does that sound familiar?
look, I had it under control.
all the marine had to do was just keep walking.
stop! You're hurting me!
I thought he'd killed my husband.
no. No, he just saved you.
and now he's dead.
you two happy?
finally got me.
I'm under arrest.
course, ten minutes from now,
I'll be at Ray's enjoying a mushroom slice for lunch.
you're not going anywhere.
no?
you picked me up on an unpaid parking ticket on my van, a crap charge if ever there was one.
maybe.
but we got you in custody.
hmm.
my lawyer is going to have a field day with you, Detective Taylor.
bring him on.
see, we knew the first thing you'd do is cry harassment, so we covered ourselves
documented every single part of your booking.
this way you can't go whining to your lawyer about being mistreated.
Yeah. I remember the photo shoot.
there's an hour of my life I'll never get back.
see this?
it's an ear print from the passenger side of a window of a burnt-out Cadillac.
and that's your left ear.
perfect match.
puts you in that Cadillac.
lift up your left sleeve.
no.
I'm not saying another word without my lawyer present.
you don't have to.
Aiden told us everything we need.
another photo from your booking.
that's a bite mark on your forearm.
Aiden bit you.
we know what you did.
just so you know...
your lawyer can't protect you anymore.
and we have the evidence to make sure you never see freedom again.
this folder...
will be right here on my desk till we get him.
how did you know that Aiden biting that armrest also meant that she bit Pratt?
homicide case six years ago.
a single mother was robbed and murdered on her way home from work.
I had a suspect, but only circumstantial evidence, not enough for a warrant.
so the case wasn't going to pan out, but there was this young detective who refused to give up.
wherever the suspect went, the detective was watching, waiting for him to make a mistake.
well, did the suspect make a mistake?
the detective was so in his head that he lashed out, took a swing, and that was enough to arrest him.
patting him down later on, the detective noticed a wound on his arm, a bite mark.
from the victim.
and that young detective was Aiden.
Aiden had to know that Pratt was going to kill her, that she was going to die.
so she left a clue.
she knew I'd understand.
I can stick around, if you want.
that's okay.
there's actually something I need to take care of.
well, that's the thing, sir.
corporal Price didn't come with us.
he said that there was something he needed to take care of alone.
seems the vic went down to the yard bar to meet a girl named Ellie.
I'm thinking it has something to do with the watch I found in his pocket.
I don't know how I can help you.
like I told the other detective,
I wasn't working last night.
I know, but, uh...
I still think you may be able to answer my question.
this photo belonged to Corporal Trevor Price.
that's him on the left.
do you know who the other man is?
that's my fiance.
he died last year in Iraq.
but I don't understand.
this man, Corporal Price, I don't know him.
no, but, uh,
I think he knew about you.
corporal Price came here last night on a mission.
to find a woman.
he was looking for you.
it's not very common, but a nickname for Alexandria...
is Ellie, isn't it?
only my fiance called me Ellie.
no one else.
but why would he share that information with Corporal Price?
I think your fiance wanted you to have something, and he knew he wouldn't be able to give it to you himself.
this belongs to you.
thank you.
no, this is no lie.
she, Aiden, gets in my face, right?
you know how she did that.
and she tells me, "keep dreaming, messer."
you know, I think you're cute, but I am way out of your league.
I am, she could just cut you down like nobody else.
Hey, Mac, glad you made it.
wouldn't miss it.
thank you.
all right.
to Aiden.
to Aiden. - To Aiden. - To Aiden.
the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event.
2005/5/20
first round's on me, ladies.
I'm all right, Roy. Think I'll get some real food.
Nah, you're coming down to Shiny's.
come on, Mike. You don't like vodka breakfast?
got to work on my boat, fellas. Thing's a frigging master piece by now.
well, I'm taking it to Florida this year.
Yeah. I'll bet you a round he doesn't do it.
double or nothing, next five years, he still doesn't do it.
funny. - Yeah.
um, you guys just, um...
I'll see you.
Hello?!
Hello?!
are you okay?
what's, um...
Hey, what's wrong with her?
Oh, God. She's burning up.
Hey. Hey.
I am taking you out of here.
no. - Yes.
you're sick. I'm taking you.
here we go.
feds have been building a case for years against an Eastern European criminal.
big-time guy, goes by Nachalneek.
Nachalneek? Russian for " boss. "
he's the puppet master of a brutal organization.
they have him? - He's a phantom. Never been ID'd.
what do his puppets do? - Human traffic at the docks.
port of Philadelphia's been ID'das a hub for importing young girls.
forced prostitution.
perfect access for New York, Jersey, DC.
had a female floaterin the Delaware yesterday.
Jane Doe so far. - Think she was trafficked?
dental work's Eastern European. Poor quality, metal fillings.
how she connect to Nachalneek? - Right age, ethnicity.
other signs of his MO.
like? - Cigarette burns.
soles of her feet.
south detectives are working the Jane Doe floater.
where do we come in?
got any cold jobs like her?
solve that, might help the feds' case against Nachalneek.
don't recall any Jane Does like this.
but we had a guy.
polish name.
cigarette burns on his feet. '05 job.
you know him, boss? - Case caught my eye.
he was a longshoreman at the port.
working the docks, he could've crossed paths with Nachalneek.
might be the key to solving this guy's murder.
and catching a ghost.
Mike Chulaski, 35,
longshoreman at Harrison Marine Terminal.
no family. Six days before anyone reported him missing.
guy was invisible. Barely left a footprint.
workers on the docks said he never missed a day.
and this...
was his pride and joy.
nice boat.
wouldn't mind one like it myself.
Mike lived on it. Went missing after he was killed.
I'll start looking for it.
motel he was found in was on the other side of town.
they were working a theory Mike was killed by a pimp.
bludgeoned with a lamp. Lots of prints, no matches.
motel clerk said another guy rented the room. Can't describe him.
no-tell motel for you.
copies of the bills of lading for the boxes that came into the terminal.
boxes? - Containers.
the FBI says the ones with the human cargo arrived when Mike's dock gang was working.
so maybe Mike was in on it? - We can't tell.
but in shipping, nothing happens without the foremanknowing about it.
says here that was Roy Gardecki.
Mike's boss. I'll go talk to him.
know a lot about the port. - I worked on the docks when I was 16.
boxes from your terminal were used to transport young girls, Roy.
fellas, I already talked to the FBI.
not about Mike Chulaski's murder.
could be just what they need to push their case through.
and you get 20 years inside.
the feds don't know what it's like down here.
of course they don't.
they don't know about the low lifes coming around, preying on the working man trying to earn a decent wage.
and you do?
worked here when I was a kid.
things I saw.
then you know it's backbreaking.
it's hard work. Lot of temptation for the easy money.
regular guy like Mike Chulaski gets tempted.
ends up dead, right, Roy?
so you and Mike line your pockets, look the other when those containers came in.
money was good.
Mike never knew about it. - Why not cut him in?
wasn't that kind of guy. He had no idea.
till that morning.
no, it's okay.
what are we gonna do, Roy?
she's so young.
where are her parents? - Alright, easy there.
fifteen.
not so young.
I'm calling the cops. - Mike, think about what you could be getting into here.
phone.
Kiril...
for job.
for me.
no, no, no, no, no. You don't wanta job with that guy.
come here.
look.
you can put her back.
right now. Kiril will kill you if you don't.
let me...go.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
you got anybody in America that we cancall right now?
family?
no.
no family, anywhere?
from orphanage.
ukraine.
I don't have family either.
orphan.
me.
what if that was you lying on that couch, huh?
sick kid? - These people are running a business!
she doesn't have any one in the world!
you know what that feels like?
no one to look out for you.
I do.
you're gonna keep her?
it's crazy.
I'm not putting her in that van, Roy.
and if you tell meto do it one more time...
well, maybe...
you and me...
we'll go to the cops together.
who was this Kiril she wanted to reach?
American. Transported the girls.
middleman.
got a number for him? - Look, I told you what I know.
meet you back at the car, Nick.
I know the waterfront, Roy.
Mike stood up against the low lifes.
it got him crushed.
you looked the other way.
now's your chance to make it right.
I'm not asking.
give me a number for Kiril.
never had one.
runner dropped a message, which box to set aside, he'd show up to unload.
that's it.
any idea who he was working for?
called him Nachalneek.
Kiril was terrified of the guy.
What'd Mike do with Lena? - Took her to his boat.
said he was gonna help her. - He say how?
try and get her a visa, take her to some community center for advice where people would know about that stuff.
we don't deal with illegals.
must get a few in here.
I mainly deal with exchange students who want to stay.
occasionally, these girls show up.
girls like Lena?
they lie about how they got here, but...
we all know.
out of the containers.
any of the girls mention the name Nachalneek?
no.
they never give any details.
I do what I can for them, but...
they're not supposed to be here.
you try helping Lena? - Can't help someone who doesn't want it.
I have no money, Mike.
this lady helps you for free.
in America people do stuff'cause they're kind, you know?
not 'cause they want something from you.
you okay?
she doesn't qualify for the T1 visa.
why not?
she wasn't prostituted, was she? No, course not.
then technically, she's here illegally.
that's how the embassy will see it, and they willdeport her.
that doesn't make sense. - Back to Ukraine?
No!
Lena. Don't go.
you don't understand what could happen to you.
can't go back.
no money. No family. Nothing there.
you got someone who cares about you now.
you don't have to go it alone anymore.
I'm hungry. Can I have candy bar?
why don't you eat a real meal? Get your strength up.
better than nothing, I guess.
I got some change.
machine's that way.
growing upon your own...
it's hard.
people treat you like a punching bag.
I don't want that to happen to her. Knocks the life out of you.
there's not much you can do for her, I'm afraid.
I can look out for her, you know?
like family.
young girl.
can be difficult.
she makes a phone call and she's gone.
I wish I could've helped more, but there's a new one every day.
think of anything else, you can reach us here.
there's only one person Lena wanted to call.
so she goes to meet him? - And Mike knows it. Tracks them down.
gets himself killed, playing hero.
what do you got?
I...need some lost hours.
I didn't know who else to call since the husband took off.
I last saw her a week ago.
she won't answer the door.
okay.
she's always saying how her daughter's got a good job.
smart girl.
is she?
so, I thought maybe you cod take care of the rent.
due three weeks ago. - Yeah, sure.
you said it's been a week?
Yeah.
mom? - She all right?
mom?
no.
call 911.
you said you'd clean up this time.
nice job. Ending up in the ER.
I gotta go home.
you're not going anywhere.
I'm going home, Lilly... Oh.
doctor said you can't drink again.
help me out here, will ya?
Where's my coat?
you have late-stagecirrhosis.
you're getting admitted.
you can't...
have another drink again.
not one.
I'm fine, Lilly.
Yeah, you look great, Mom.
what do you want from me?
you'll have to come stay with me.
I thought you were"getting too old for this. "
I said that when I still had a choice.
Kiril's in custody. Tracked him to a pay-as-you-go cell.
Kiril faces federal trafficking charges.
any deal's possible if he points to Nachalneek.
even if he killed Mike Chulaski? - Any deal. US Attorney's gunning for Nachalneek.
it's all aboutthe big fish, huh? Never mind a poor working guy getting offed.
Nachalneek's the prize.
Prize...is locking up Mike's doer for life.
not for the feds. Yeah, we'll help them get their phantom.
good.
ain't gonna cut a deal with a murderer, though.
don't go cowboy on us, okay?
what the hell does that mean?
the Burrell job, Scotty.
vigilante dad?
you screwed up.
don't screw this up.
I put dirt bags away. You do the paperwork.
can't handle a strong woman, can you?
no, maybe I just don't like you.
broken wing's more your type.
you don't know me. - Yeah. I do.
can't stand it, huh? - Stand what?
that I can handle you.
so, how'd it go, Kiril? Mike steals away one of your girls, so you have him killed?
my girls?
I'd love to help you gents, but you got the wrong guy.
cut the BS.
a witness saw you loading those girls into a van.
Oh, look, I was just a driver.
picked up the girls, TVs, whatever needed delivering.
you work for Nachalneek?
Nah, just, just heard the name.
but friendly advice.
you might as well stop looking. Why's that?
you talk about Nachalneek, you disappear.
so where'd you take the girls and the TVs?
that's where my memory fails me.
sorry, gents.
lay of the land, Kiril.
you're looking at 20 in federal prison.
for what?
trafficking.
witness, remember?
unless you prefer a murder charge for Mike Chulaski.
I never killed nobody.
help us with Mike's murder, do a reduced sentence.
so where'd you take Lena?
some...
crap building.
12 Pearl Street. - What went on there?
dump full of underage tail?
what do you think?
and Mike? - Oh, Mike was a dumbassof epic proportion.
he find you on the docks after Lena disappeared on him?
Yeah. Wanted something wasn't his property.
excuse me.
what? - Excuse me. Can you, uh...
I gotta talk to you. Can you...?
what? - Where's Lena?
curly hair. Yea high.
she's one of your girls.
Oh.
you're a rube. You're way out of your depth.
better walk away. - I want her.
what's that? - I want her!
you think you can get your rocks off for free?
Hey, wake up. It's America. Nothing's for free.
she's a kid. It's not like that.
you're begging for this girl, and you say it ain't for sex?
so what, you wanna watch TV together?
admit it.
all right!
all right what?
I want to...
bang her.
you were right.
just...
tell me where I can do that.
12 Pearl Street.
knock yourself out.
guy was just a horny perv like all the rest.
that's all I know.
so...
I'm done, right?
sit your ass down.
your next stop'sthe federal pen.
12 Pearl Street's abandoned. Previous tenantsall fake names. Dead end.
so, Kiril played us? - Not quite.
found a 911 call for an overdose to that address two years back.
gave the girl's real name.
Accurint's got an address for her in Long Island. Town called Bellport.
if Kateryna workedat Pearl Street, maybe she knew Lena.
and saw Mike when he came looking for her.
didn't think you were coming in.
me neither.
we've got everything covered if you gotta be somewhere else.
I'd rather be here than where I was.
fair enough.
you have an appointment? - Kateryna Yevchenko?
detectives Valens and Miller, from Philadelphia.
we're lookinginto a homicide. Mike Chulaski.
ring a bell?
he came to Pearl Street looking for a girl named Lena.
long time ago.
I don't remember.
that why you OD'd?
what went on in that place, Kateryna?
bad as you imagine.
worse.
we were slaves.
how'd you get out?
after I am too old for Pearl Street,
I go on my own.
I am good, so I get nest egg.
what about this guy Mike?
I take money from Mike to bring him to Lena.
she wasn't with the others?
in different room because she resisted.
another $50.
Lena. Oh, God.
they lied about job, Mike. - I know.
they lied. - I'm gonna get you out.
they won't let you. They will kill her.
what's wrong? - My feet.
cigarette burns. She can't walk.
you get her hopes up, you make it worse for her. You cannot save her.
I'm not leaving you here Lena. - I can't walk, Mike.
Nachalneek's coming.
listen, this necklace, you see this?
it's St. Nicholas. He'll keep you safe until I came back.
I've seen you before.
you should know better, Katya.
get him out. - Mike, no, don't leave me here.
Mike, don't leave me here.
don't leave me. Don't leave me here!
don't leave me here! - I'll come back for you, I promise!
come back and you're dead.
Nachalneek was Boyka?
I will never testify against her.
that was her thing? The burning?
what she did to us.
punishment.
so Mike promises he's going back for Lena...
winds up Boyka cigarette on him.
so you're the famous Nachalneek.
lot of people looking for you.
Nachalneek just means boss.
could be anyone.
there's a witness.
this person wants to testify?
the FBI is charging you with violation of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.
and this person wants to testify?
that's their issue. We have you for murder.
I don't know who that is.
you met him when he came looking for Lena, one of your girls.
winds up dead with your trademark cigarette burns on him.
someone has framed me.
you got to do better than that, boss.
I'm happy to.
honesty is the best policy.
let me in!
I'm not leaving!
you are risking your life for nothing.
what do you want for her, money?
I need a young one.
take Kateryna instead.
blonde, beautiful, doesn't complain.
I want Lena.
everybody left her, but not me.
I won't. - You can't afford Lena.
I'll give you $50, 000.
you have this kind of money? - I'll get it.
she has potential, but...
she's difficult.
get the money, you can have her.
Kiril will contact you.
so Mike and Kiril met up? - Starlight Motel.
Kiril went for my money, but I never saw it or Lenaor Kiril again.
you're locked up, Boyka. - On what charge?
prostitution and conspiracy.
I'll be in jail one night.
don't fool yourselves.
but thank you for finding him.
Kiril.
he's in custody. You can't touch him.
Oh, no?
you got stones, Kiril.
turned on Nachalneek.
pocketed Mike's money, killed him at the motel swap.
who told you that?
Nachalneek herself.
aka Boyka.
she know I talked to you? - Yeah.
you two got a lot to sort out. - Maybe they should talk face-to-face.
you got to get me out of general population.
you want that, you better start singing.
for starters, how is it you're in a motel room with Mike, and he ends up with his head bashed in?
okay, I'll tell you.
just protect me from her.
listening.
I got two rooms at this motel in Point Breeze.
why two?
I met Mike in one; Lena's in the other.
the plan was, when I got the cash,
I'd call Lena, bring her to him.
that was pretty cloak-and-dagger. - Was Boyka's idea.
that way, Mike would never know where Lena was, if he got stupid.
Mike bring the money? - No. The dumb ass got stupid again.
50000
I got eight grand here. And I got the rest coming from a loan.
I'll give the rest as well.
deal's off.
I got a bo.
it's a beauty.
perfect, actually.
I don't need a boat. - You'll make money on this.
you could sell it, get $70, 000 in a heartbeat.
70? How do you figure?
I spent the last ten years of my life fixing it up.
I mean it. It's a prize.
that's coming from you, though.
you're a capital "T" tool.
go look at it. Tacony Marina, slip 220.
keys. - I'm not giving them up without Lena.
forget it, then.
you take the boat.
I take her.
she's my family now.
your boyfriend's acting like a dumb ass, as per usual.
so sit pretty. I'll be back in an hour.
stay put.
Mike was still alive when you left?
Yeah.
watching me from the door, that idiot. - Yeah.
and when you got back?
head's smashed in, boat keys missing.
Lena still in the other room? - You think I stuck around to find out?
I screwed up a job for Boyka. That's the end of the road.
fine. Thanks - I got lost.
Miller found Mike's boat.
the marina up in Connecticut.
find an owner? - Guy says he bought it in cash here in Philly from a young girl, - foreign accent. - Lena.
kid didn't have a heart of gold after all.
guard.
Kiril give this up? - New house run by Boyka.
thinking one of these girls knows where Lena ran?
locked in a house together. Must've shared something.
don't really want to see this.
I'm not Lena.
Lena, we found Mike's boat.
stop calling me that. It's not my name.
you want to forget who you used to be?
when you first came here, met Mike.
he saved you.
I know you remember.
cause you kept his necklace.
that thing.
I don't know what it is. - You remember, Lena.
how Mike told you'd always be safe with this necklace, and how you betrayed him.
me betray him?
I did not! - You took his money, and you left him to die.
he is dead?
he was murdered.
Mike said...
in America, people do things to be kind.
but they don't.
Mike didn't want anything from you.
that's right.
not from me.
his house is a boat.
I make you look nice. Sit still.
and he says that you never are dizzy after you live there for a few days.
and he say I can go to school for free, no problem.
I don't want you to get your hopes up, little duck.
but Mike promised me.
how many time I've seen people in this country tell lies.
not Mike.
he is different from everybody.
your boyfriend's acting like a dumbass, as per usual.
so sit pretty. I'll be back in an hour.
it is Mike?
I am so sorry.
what? - It is good you did not hope too much.
what did he say?
Mike wants a girlfriend.
for sex.
he asked for me, the pretty one.
my poor little duck.
he said he would come for me.
he wants me now.
stay here.
someone will come for you.
I gave up hope like she said.
doesn't hurt anymore.
wait. He came for you.
not Kateryna.
she lied, not Mike.
no.
they all lie.
he gave up his boat to get you from Nachalneek.
his boat is... is where he live.
and he was willing to give it up.
for me?
he was killed trying to save you.
he said...
that you were his family.
get what you wanted, Kateryna?
I earn it all.
I work very hard to get what I deserve.
the American dream.
now I can be new person, hold my head up.
every dream takes sacrifice.
what was yours?
I sold my body.
does things to you. Makes you desperate.
you were at the motel. Went to Mike's room, night he died.
you lied to Lena. Said Mike didn't want to save her.
he didn't. He was like all the others.
like the other men who hurt you?
why'd you take away her chance to have a decent life?
I was dying in that house, too.
so you killed a man.
finally get something for yourself.
you don't understand what it was like.
how could you?!
ten men a day?
spitting on you, ripping you apart.
when I first got there,
I resisted, too
I used to believe someone would come and take me away.
but no one came.
Mike did.
not for me.
you've seen Lena?
where has Kiril gone?
uh, to see my boat.
I'm giving it to him for Lena.
Where's Lena? Is she okay? - She is not here.
now relax, Daddy.
Yes, yes.
did something happen to her?
okay. Get off me!
choose me instead. I am much better.
you want me to be sister, daughter?
please. I will. - What are you doing?
don't make me go back to that house.
Mike, you are a nice man.
I give you anything.
I just want Lena. That's all.
no, no. Help me.
I'll help you once I've got her, okay?
please. - Can't let her down.
I'm all she has.
I want somebody to care for me so I am not alone.
I'm sorry.
I got to find Lena.
what about me?
I got to go. I'm sorry.
what about me?!
what about me?!
if yesterday was thanksgiving and today is christmas, what's tomorrow?
Saturday.
are we going to exchange gifts?
you know, christmas gifts?
some small token of partnership?
I'll check in again with you closer to the big day.
how was your thanksgiving?
my dad's still gone, my mom got drunk, and I did the dishes. You?
Ted made some kind of bird.
it was either a very large chicken or a very small turkey.
maybe a baby turkey.
do they sell those? Baby turkeys?
it tasted like chicken though.
fell from up there someplace.
Yeah, but fell slipped, fell pushed, or fell jumped?
neck snapped. Died instantly.
what do you say? You're the first jumper of the holiday season?
sorry. Sorry.
got me a solid column of the wife's stuffing and gravy starts at my neck runs straight down to my...
well, straight down.
first jumper of the season?
it seems a little early, but you never know.
you get an I.D. on him?
head of mall security.
Dave, these are detectives Crews and Reese.
head of security.
crime scene's all battened down.
good to know that, dave.
do you know this man?
sure. Mitchell Clark. He worked up on the second level.
doesn't seem that far to fall.
not from down here it doesn't.
how well did you know mr. Clark?
I saw him around.
you know, I try to familiarize myself with all the employees for security reasons..
he seem depressed?
that I wouldn't know.
do you think he killed himself?
Oh, I hope he didn't kill himself.
well, if he didn't kill himself, then someone probably pushed him.
you mean killed him?
the world coming to an end?
kind of. It's 6: 00 A. M. The mall's opening.
the mall's opening?
I thought you said you'd secured the crime scene.
well, I put out this yellow tape, but you think I closed the mall?
I can't close the mall. I just work here.
anyway, it's black friday.
biggest shopping day of the year?
hold up! Wait! Wait!
wait, wait, wait! Hey, hey, hey! No, no, no!
stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
the crime scene!
crime scene.
the body's gone?
the body's gone.
it's a miracle.
a genuine miracle.
you know, I lost a girlfriend at a mall once, but it was to the guy who can stand motionless for hours.
so, you know, they had that in common.
but a body, a dead body -- wait a minute.
could it be a christmas miracle?
if someone took the body, they took it for a reason.
perhaps it's all the "everything must go" signs.
probably not.
if someone took a body like that
maybe it was gonna tell us something.
it did tell us something.
it wasn't a suicide.
the killer took the body.
all right, K9, you find the body.
you find the killer, and I'm going to everything-on-a-stick to find some breakfast.
where were you last night?
isn't that the kind of question you ask a suspect?
I was at my sister's.
it was thanksgiving.
and you were there all night?
she lives in Ojai. I slept over.
you can ask her. Or the little brat whose room I took.
came in this morning and sat on my head, full diaper.
Thanksgiving.
Mitchell was scheduled to open for me today.
he's always so punctual, I thought something was wrong.
we need to know where you were last night.
it was thanksgiving. I was with my family. Wasn't everyone?
we need the phone number for the victim's next of kin.
he didn't list anything.
he split with his wife a couple of years ago.
she moved back to Minneapolis or one of those states back there.
there's a rumor that you all lost his body, but I just say that's silly.
you're right. That is silly.
was Mitchell having trouble with anyone at work or in the mall?
he never said anything.
did he have friends here?
well, he didn't think I knew, but I think he was dating Erika from the hat kiosk.
she's way too young for him.
you can't miss her.
she dresses like a tramp.
try lost and found on level two.
heard you're looking for a body.
that's a strange reaction.
yeah? Why's that?
because we heard you were dating Mitchell Clark.
dating the shoe store guy? Who said that?
his manager at sole fix.
Oh, her.
she's just jealous because guys ask about me.
I mean, look at her. Look at me.
where were you last night?
I was off. It was thanksgiving.
ate some turkey with the family?
kind of.
clay and I went to the pocket stop for pot pies and rock-it fuel.
didn't see Mitchell Clark?
I said no.
I'm sure he's got friends his own age.
you should ask him when you find him.
I have to get back to work.
is this store all key chains?
they're called fobs.
fobs? Just fobs?
do you get a lot of repeat business?
clay, did you know Mitchell Clark from the shoe store?
no. I heared you lost the body.
Oh, you heard that, huh?
if there's no body, how do you know someone's dead?
we have a test. It's called the dead test.
Mitchell Clark passed.
Oh, dude, I'd hate to take that test.
clay, do you want some potato chips?
why would I want potato chips?
Oh, it just seems like you might like some.
do you know Erika over there?
Yeah, yeah.
was she dating Mitchell Clark?
the shoe store guy? No. No, I mean, look at her. Look at him.
well, look at him when you find him.
who works over there?
I don't know. - Come on. Thanks.
who doesn't come to work on the busiest shopping day of the year?
have questions? Call Zak Sutter...
is this Zak?
it's detective Crews, the lapd.
Yeah, we saw you weren't at work.
we saw the sign and called you.
we have some questions we'd like to ask you.
he says he's sick. Won't be here until tomorrow.
Hey, hang on. Hang on a minute. You're cutting out.
I see. Okay.
that was mall music.
he's in the mall.
Hey, you don't know the guy who works five feet from you?
no, man, sorry.
kiosk people kind of come and go.
don't know him.
you lose him too?
he's here someplace.
Yeah, but it's the seventh largest mall in the world.
I heard it was the fifth.
can you show me how you do that thing when you block the caller I. D.?
your dad still gone?
Yep.
maybe he'll come back.
or maybe he won't, and then I'll finally get what I want for christmas.
I'd say so.
I guess he didn't see the sign.
guess he didn't see that one either.
good place to hide a body down here.
okay, okay. Who are you?
I'm detective Crews.
I spoke to you on the phone, Zak.
anything here you want to show us?
no, no, no, no--wait, wait, wait! Don't open that!
let me tell you something.
when I grew up, the idea that the mayor of Los Angeles would call me his friend was not something a kid like me would dream about.
but I've been lucky here.
lucky to have been a police officer for the city of los angeles.
how does an ex-cop get that kind of money?
maybe he worked for it.
and holds land all over the city, three hotels, owns a big piece of that development going up in the marina.
owns the afina ghting franchise.
we should go to a match.
and now if somebody will just give me a shovel, I'll show you.
Charlie, isn't that your ex-wife?
what is she doing here?
I don't know.
well, maybe we should go.
what are you doing here?
it was ted's idea.
something about a tax deduction. What about you?
me? Oh, you can't imagine how many of these things we have to go to.
we?
my husband.
he's around here somewhere on a call.
I got a car. It has a back seat.
it got-- it got shot up.
I mean, I shot it up, but, you know, it still drives.
what do you want, Charlie?
what do you want to do?
I want to go back.
back where?
there.
I want to go back there.
Yeah. But we can't go back.
because we're here now. - Yes.
I know. We're here now.
Charlie, I have to find my husband.
agent Bodner?
we need to talk, but not here.
your father died of cancer, october 2007.
your mother in a car accident a month later.
you and Carin were supposed to enter foster care.
they don't know us.
you can't become Carin's legal guardian until you're 21.
you plan to live in the mall for the next four years?
I have a job there.
I can take care of her.
Zak, did you know Mitchell Clark? - No.
I heard you lost the body though.
bet your boss is pretty mad about that.
when the mall closed down last night, did you hear anything unusual or see anything?
when we're in our room, we stay in our room.
Really? You have the mall to yourselves. I'd go out.
well, that's you.
when can I talk to my sister?
how long have you and your brother been living at the mall?
since your mom died?
Yeah.
Carin, you know you can't live at a mall, don't you?
I have Zak.
he's a good brother.
what about my things?
your things are at the mall, and we'll have them brought to you.
brought to me?
Why? Where am I going?
I want to go home.
what's it like, living in the mall?
well, it's the second largest mall in the world, so, you know, a dream come true.
Zak, what's it like living in the mall?
well, it's the second largest mall in the world, so, you know, a dream come true.
Yeah.
okay, Zak, you know the state's gonna want to hold you.
because we're minors.
because you're minors. Because you were trespassing.
and, Zak, because a man died.
so we might need to talk to you again.
when can I see my sister?
I'll call children's services to take custody.
they're children. I have to call children's services.
they wanted to split them up.
who wanted to split what up?
those kids.
children's services would have separated them.
after their parents died, they ran.
all they've got is each other.
I still have to call them.
unless someone wants to ask me to do them a personal favor.
all right. I'll see if I can find somebody to track down a relative.
while they wait here.
detective Reese-- are we still on for dinner?
only if you never say it out loud again.
tidwell.
they were living in a mall.
for almost a year.
lived right here, in a mall.
he was taking care of his sister.
you know, not a lot of kids would do that.
Yeah, but if two kids have been living here unnoticed, what else is going on?
let's split up.
Crews? Did you go shopping?
it's black friday, Reese.
everything's on sale.
man, my dogs are tired.
I thought we were supposed to find out what else was going on here.
Oh, I found out a lot of things.
I found out you really can't get everything at everything-on-a-stick.
you can get papaya, which some people think tastes like barf.
I don't.
Oh, the girl at the bubbles told me you shouldn't wash your face with soap.
did you know that?
all my life I've washed my face with soap.
the guy in the bookstore, he told me that in four days I could learn to speak dutch.
four days, Reese.
by tuesday, what I'm saying to you now, I could say to you in dutch.
Oh, the woman at opticals told me that with the shape of face you have, you should be wearing these frames.
put them on.
how does she know the shape of my face?
I described you.
by tuesday, I could describe you in dutch. Put them on.
she was right. They do look good.
you're what they call a "pinched ovoid."
don't take it personally. Did you get me anything?
the girl at lola's, she told me
I don't think I want to know this.
no, you do.
the girl at lola's told me that the dead shoe store guy and the hat kiosk girl are in there a lot, together.
together together?
together together.
so clay and Erika lied to us about knowing Mitchell.
let's go to the kiosks.
no, they're working at the gift wrap hut. I saw them there today.
do you want these?
they have a patented breathability patch. Microfibers.
I can't return them. You can't return underwear.
it's about time.
these things are heavy.
just get in the back. These people need their presents wrapped.
he says they're fighting about fruitcake.
there's no fight about fruitcake. Everyone hates fruitcake.
it's fruit and it's cake. What's not to like?
that it's the heaviest substance known to man?
what did you just say?
that I hate it?
no, the other thing.
if I gave you one of these, would you wrap it up and give me back an x-box?
because we think people are giving you x-boxes, and you're handing them back fruitcake.
now what kind of holiday spirit is that?
bad elf.
Hi, Charlie.
Hi, Jen.
this place looks exactly the same.
exactly. Right?
remember the night your dad caught us here?
I remember how nervous you were the first time we checked in.
no, I wasn't nervous.
Yes, you were.
I was too.
I thought you said we couldn't go back.
we can go back tonight.
who did this to us, Charlie?
I don't know.
but you're gonna find them?
Yeah.
I loved you, Charlie.
so much.
I loved you too, Jen.
the fruitcake gag, you think it up?
kid wakes up christmas morning, opens up a box of delicious fruitcake.
who wouldn't like that?
that's a lot of fruitcake.
you don't want to go down for the full freight on this.
full freight? - Homicide.
you mean murder?
that's what it means.
for Mitchell Clark's murder?
you're trying to trick me.
well, Mitchell's alive. I know that for a fact.
how do you know that, clay?
Oh, look at all this stolen merchandise we found at your apartment, Erika.
my partner and I, we work robbery/homicide.
but there's a little play in the robbery charge, as long as it helps us solve a homicide.
there is no homicide.
Mitchell isn't dead.
he is.
you had a relationship with him you don't want to talk about.
this is all about hurting Mitchell.
that won't happen.
Mitchell cares about us.
you don't care about us.
maybe he cared about you, Erika, but not anymore.
Mitchell Clark is alive.
they swear he's not dead.
this is why we like to have a body in these situations.
it helps keep things simple.
are you liking that?
there is a distinct possibility that this isn't fruit or cake.
they mean it when they say he's not dead.
but he is dead.
Yeah, he is.
but they mean it when they say he's not dead.
so... he's Risen? He's elvis?
what?
don't you "what" me.
the kids. Where's Zak and Carin?
it's been a full day.
detective, a police station is no place for kids.
back me up on this, Crews.
I'm gonna be switzerland here.
they had nazi gold.
you sent them to children's services.
I couldn't find a relative.
there wasn't anybody who wants them.
detective, they are children.
children's services are where they need to be.
now, I've got two thieves in there.
and from all that swag, it looks like they've been at it for quite a while.
and a good guess is that the dead guy who they lied about not knowing was a thief too.
so I'm waiting for you two to tell me who killed him.
fruitcake?
Reese, come on.
how would you get rid of me?
tidwell said find the killer, not the body.
you do everything tidwell says?
the question isn't who killed him.
it is if you're homicide cops, which we are.
no, the question is why do they think he's not dead?
come on, it's weird, right?
to think he's not dead?
you're sCaring the children.
Reese, come on.
how would you get rid of my body?
would you put me in one of these big boxes like a present?
they've been searched.
would you cut me up into tiny pieces?
no blood, no knife, no time.
would you drag me across the parking lot and put me in the trunk of your car?
that's a long way to go with a body.
you know, if I want to get rid of you, I'd put you in the nearest store.
but the cadaver dogs have been through the mall and didn't find anything.
maybe they didn't find anything 'cause there's too much there.
you like goldfish?
no. What did you find out?
K9 didn't bring the dogs into here.
said there's too much animal scent to get a hit.
the uniforms have scheduled a visual search.
they haven't done it yet?
Hey, Reese, ever had a bunny?
cedar chips in the cage.
smells like a walk in the woods.
Mitchell Clark, there you are.
Yeah, but who put him there?
black friday we did not open at 6 A. M.
what time did you open?
no one wants a lizard at 6 A. M. No one.
and where were you?
Thanksgiving, I was with my family.
isn't everyone?
who has access to the store?
the owner, in tahiti.
my partner, in rehab.
security.
security. - Dave.
what do you want for christmas? What do you mean you don't know? How can you not know? Come on.
moonlighting?
Oh, I do this every year.
I like to spread a little cheer.
now, you'll have to wait your turn like good boys and girls, detectives.
Hey, santa, guess what?
we just got an early christmas present.
Oh, what's that?
Mitchell Clark's body.
in the cedar chips, back of paws and claws.
well, I'd imagine that'd be a big help to your investigation.
it is.
Yeah, see, the store was closed, but guess who had the access code?
as the head of security, I can assure you that 18 people have access to that store.
come on, son.
and we've already established where I was when Mitchell went off that balcony.
and of course, I was with you when he went missing.
this isn't-- is this real?
it's real.
but he was here. You had him.
who told you that?
Erika, who told you Mitchell was still alive?
that we had him? - Was it dave?
were you stealing from Mitchell?
we all were.
then, friday morning, Mitchell was gone.
Dave said you had him.
that if we did what he said, Mitchell would get out and come back to us.
so we did what dave said. I...
I did what Dave said.
you want to tell us about Mitchell?
I'd do anything for him.
everyone would.
anything he said, ever since I left home.
he was everything.
how old were you when you left home?
young.
and Mitchell was everything.
and you did what he said too?
Erika, how old were you when he started with you?
too young.
do you know who killed him, Erika?
could Dave have done it?
Dave is the one that likes to keep everybody in line for Mitchell.
Dave liked to do that.
keep people in line.
except for Zak.
Zak isn't like the rest of us.
he and his sister.
Dave was worried Zak would talk.
I found the aunt. The kids' aunt. In phoenix.
remarried, changed her name. See that? Happy ending.
Yeah, this is detective Reese. You have a Carin sutter.
she came in with her older brother Zak.
Yeah. Okay. I got it.
they're gone.
they jumped out of the car at a stop light.
carin and her brother, they're--they're gone.
we'll find them. We'll put out an amber alert and we'll find them.
Dani-- detective, we will find them.
Dave was worried Zak would talk.
what if he finds them first?
carin wanted to go home.
she just wanted to go home.
it's so stupid. So stupid. Stupid!
if you run, you'll only die tired.
I really wanted to shoot him.
no, you just really wanted to shoot someone.
no, he would have done just fine.
watch your head.
where did that blood come from, Dave?
I cut myself.
Carin, it's okay.
Where's Zak?
Carin? Come here.
Where's your brother?
don't!
Carin, it's okay. Let it go.
we can book dave for the assault, but not for the murder.
because the killer's right here.
is he going to hurt my brother?
no.
no. No, sweetie, he's not.
Hey, Dave swears he's not good for the killing.
he said he hid the body so it looked like Mitchell was still alive, but did not kill him.
and get this, when I asked him how he got the body across the floor without being seen, Dave told me he took the dead guy's arm, put it around his shoulder, and walked him out.
weekend at bernie-ish.
everyone was looking for the sales, no one even noticed.
I got something else too.
Yeah, what's that?
the kids' aunt.
she'd been looking for them.
she wants to take them home.
time for you to go home.
but what about Zak?
when we came in before, down there, your sister, with that stick, she protected you.
you protect her too.
don't you, Zak?
we protect each other.
Yeah, but you're the big brother.
you're the man, Zak. Right?
we know what Mitchell did to Erika.
we know how old Erika was when Mitchell started in with her.
you protected your sister.
you protected Carin, so Mitchell would not do that to her.
I did what I had to do.
you know, I--I-- I had to stop him. He had her.
so I chased him up the stairs, and he was right next to the railing.
and he tripped. - No, he didn't.
he tripped and fell.
right over the railing.
there was nothing you could do.
sometimes people just fall.
Hey, that looks like your aunt over there.
let me get you up.
how about that body?
what?
the one you and your partner found in the pet store. That was good work.
Thanks.
you don't mind if I--? - No, no. I don't mind.
I, um, I thought you weren't coming.
because of the kids.
because I, uh, sent the kids to children's services.
I thought you'd be pissed.
well, that was the job.
the job's the job.
you did what you had to do.
so, you know, let's just leave it back there.
all right. Good for you. The job's the job.
Yep, that's the way I like to do it.
some people, though, they can't-- they can't leave it back there, you know?
they have to take it home with them.
runs around in their mind all night long.
me, I just-- I leave it at work.
but someone like that, they'd probably be pretty pissed off at someone like me.
you okay?
you know what? I am pissed.
you know something?
you look a lot bigger from the side.
Hi, this is Jennifer.
I'm not here right now, but please leave a message for me for when I am here.
special agent Bodner.
federal Bureau of Investigation.
what happened to homeland security?
I was just on loan there.
now I'm back where I belong.
who shot your car?
I did.
you did?
my partner helped.
Yeah. Okay.
is this the part where you tell me there's something I should know?
Yeah, what you should know is that I know you want mickey Rayborn.
and that's not gonna happen.
are the FBI investigating him or protecting him?
sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.
but if you want Rayborn, you'd have to come at us.
and if you come at us, you'll find yourself and no ginchy little civil rights lawyer is gonna get you out this time.
gum?
Thanks.
tropical fruit?
it's the only kind I chew.
don't look so worried.
it's my job.
no, it's not. You're a housewife.
Yeah, punk?
you see my house around here?
a housewife.
they don't have a mother.
she might be somewhere else.
maybe she got eaten.
everything is food for something else.
could you be more obvious?
here, enjoy.
are you trying to buy my silence with fruit?
of course not. There's also jerky.
will you please tell me why your dad has a secret barn full of walkers?
it's creepy. - Shh.
you know that, right? - Shh.
just trust me on this, okay?
but I suck at lying.
I can't even play poker. It's too much like lying.
you have to keep this to yourself.
you have to. Please.
Dale, here's some peaches for you.
mm, thank you.
morning. - Morning.
what's up? - Nothing.
nothing's up. Why?
Hey.
this is not that great, but...
what, no pictures?
I'm so sorry. I feel like shit.
Yeah, you and me both.
I don't expect you to forgive me,
but if there's anything I can do...
you were trying to protect the group.
we're good.
but hey, shoot me again, and you'd best pray I'm dead.
what did Rick say?
you didn't tell him?
okay.
but you have to.
you're pregnant.
you need vitamins, medicine, a nice pillow.
here.
you can have my share.
honey, I don't want your food, okay?
eat.
you need to eat. You're too skinny.
and if you're not gonna let
Rick take care of you, then someone has to.
Lori, you have a medical condition.
I'll make another run into town.
just tell me what you need.
I need you to be quiet about this.
all right? Please.
Hey! Peach man.
the creek flows south, past that farmhouse Daryl found.
maybe Sophia dropped the doll there,
the current brought it downstream.
so what, you think she took this road here and then she went north?
Yeah. What's up that way?
a housing development.
it went in maybe 10 years ago.
take a run up there after gun practice.
I'll hold down the fort here, but take backup.
after what went down with daryl,
I don't want anyone going out alone.
we stay in pairs.
I'll take suggestions on a partner.
see how they do on the range, then take your pick.
Thanks.
my binoculars.
yeah yeah.
okay, bye.
we'd like to join you for gun training today.
Hershel's been very clear.
I can't involve any of you in what we do without his okay.
he doesn't like it, but he consented.
Otis was the only one who knew guns.
now that he's gone, we gotta learn to protect ourselves.
her father saw the sense in that.
no offense, but I'll ask Hershel myself.
dude, nice lid, man.
what's going on?
I want to learn to shoot too.
can you teach me?
well, man, that's-- that's up to your parents.
can you talk to them? They'll listen to you.
we'll see, okay?
Hey.
let me see what you've got there.
how the hell did this happen?
well, it's my fault. I let him into the R. V.
he said he wanted a walkie, that you sent him for one.
so on top of everything else, he lied.
what's he thinking?
he wants to learn how to shoot. He asked me to teach him.
now it's none of my business,
but I'm happy to do it. It's your call.
I'm not comfortable with it.
Oh, don't make me out to be the unreasonable one here. Rick?
I know. I have my concerns too, but
there's no but. He was just shot.
he's just back on his feet and he wants a gun?
better than him being afraid of 'em.
there are guns in camp for a reason.
he should learn to handle them safely.
I don't want my kid walking around with a gun.
but how can you defend that?
you can't let him go around without protection.
he's as safe as he'll ever be right here.
look, everything you're saying makes perfect sense. It feels wrong.
I mean I didn't feel good about him following you out into the woods.
and I wish I'd said something.
I should've gone with my gut.
he's growing up, thank god.
we've got to start treating him more like an adult.
then he needs to act like one.
he's not mature enough to handle a gun.
I'm not gonna play with it, mom.
it's not a toy.
I'm sorry I disappointed you, but I want to look for Sophia and I want to defend our camp.
I can't do that without a gun.
Shane's the best instructor I know.
I've seen him teach kids younger than Carl.
you will take this seriously and you will behave responsibly.
and if I hear from anyone in this camp that you're not living up to our expectations
he won't let you down.
Yeah.
now if you're gonna do this, you listen to Shane.
okay, dad. - All right? You be careful.
you coming? - I gotta help Dale clean the spark plugs on the R. V.
he said he's gonna teach me mechanics.
I should probably go look for him.
you found me.
he's a good learner.
spark plugs, huh?
want to tell me what's going on?
you're old.
you're-- you know things.
so.
what if somebody told you something that somebody else should know--?
Glenn, stop being dramatic. Spit it out.
there's-- there's walkers in the barn and Lori's pregnant.
Hey, come on, man. Don't give me that gangsta shit.
good work.
don't be discouraged.
you'll hit the target eventually.
who says I didn't hit my target?
try this one. It's heavy.
you get better balance, twice the rounds.
I'd say she's got the hang of it.
I'd say she's ready for the advanced class.
it might be worth your while after the rest of us head back to camp.
sure. Why not?
how's it feeling? - I like the weight.
so you decided not to leave us.
something change your mind?
got it. - That's a great shot.
nervous Nelly?
she find her way home?
found her in her stall this morning.
I love your fields.
took a long walk this morning.
I ended up by the barn.
I heard the moans.
that's unfortunate.
I'm sure you have your reasons for keeping this a secret.
I saw the broadcasts before they stopped, saw the irrational fear, the atrocities, like the incident at my well.
we put down a walker.
you killed a person.
well, if you watched the same broadcasts I did,
you saw walkers attack, kill. They're dangerous.
a paranoid schizophrenic is dangerous too.
we don't shoot sick people.
with all due respect, you are cut off from the outside world here.
but I've seen people that I cared about die and come back, and they're not people.
my wife and stepson are in that barn.
they're people.
I'm sorry.
let me help.
I'll speak to Rick. He's a good man.
we can make the barn more secure, keep everybody safe.
the barn is secure.
keep this to yourself if you want to help.
Rick is a man of conscience, but are you so sure about everyone in your group?
afternoon.
I take it your boy did well.
not bad, actually.
be grateful you don't have a daughter.
if only things were as simple as wanting to shoot.
Carl's getting that chance, thanks to you.
and I'm eternally grateful for what you did and your hospitality.
we'll earn our keep.
I appreciate that, but with Carl getting better,
I imagine you'll be moving on soon
fort Benning, I hear.
still a virgin. - The target's too small.
come on, that's crap. Half-hour ago
I saw you nail a bull's-eye at 25'.
it wasn't moving.
you think a walker's gonna hold still for you?
focus and reload, go again.
Uh-oh, did I piss you off?
come on, girl, you've got walkers all around you.
they're the woods. They're in the R. V.
you're gonna need more than a damn screwdriver.
stop badgering me. - You're too damn emotional.
you need to shut it down. Take all that guilt, take that fear, that being pissed off, take it out.
right, 'cause you're so calm.
see that? See, I can be pissed off.
I could be whistling "Dixie" and I'll always hit the target.
but you, god, you shoot like a damn girl.
you stand here and you point your weapon.
point like you point your finger. Do not think about it.
I'm talking about muscle memory, girl
muscle memory.
now go on, shoot that son of a bitch.
he's coming for you! He's 10 feet away!
he's 9 feet-- he's 5 feet away!
right there, that's the walker that got Amy.
now you shoot that son of a bitch! Shoot him!
Hershel expects us to leave?
does anybody else know?
not yet.
were you gonna tell me? - Of course.
when? How long have you known?
not long. You don't need to worry about this.
how can you expect me not to worry? We have shelter here and food and water and medical care.
I've been talking with Hershel. It's not carved in stone.
he thinks it is.
we have to fix this.
people are settling in here. They'll be devastated.
I know. I'm working on it.
maybe I can talk to him too and plead our case.
no, things are uneasy. The best thing right now is to give Hershel some space.
don't look at me like that.
like what?
like you're scared. Like you don't trust me.
I can take it from everyone else, but not from you.
I don't understand how you could keep something like this from me.
Carl's barely on his feet. And Sophia's missing.
and Daryl and T-dog are hurt. How can we leave?
it's not what I want either, but if we have to go,
I'll do whatever it takes to make sure
you and carl are okay.
we'll get by. We will.
okay.
come on, let me give you a lift.
my feet work just fine.
look, I'm just trying to get you rattled,
give you an idea
what it's like when the shits starts to fly.
is that an apology?
I crossed the line when I brought amy into it.
Yeah, it's an apology.
you're a real dick sometimes.
Yeah, I acknowledge that. I'll tell you what:
I've got a lead on sophia. I'm gonna go check it out.
why don't you come with me, be my backup?
my wife was pregnant once.
she miscarried
and we didn't try again after that.
I'm so sorry.
the thing that I remember most
is how nauseated she became
at the smell of cooking meat.
and she was a meat-eating gal-- my wife,
but with the pregnancy
that thanksgiving,
the turkey
she couldn't be in the house
for two days until it was aired out,
poor thing.
glenn told you?
what did you expect? The boy has no guile.
I haven't told Rick.
I can't.
because of Shane?
was it that obvious?
no no, I don't think anyone knew.
I didn't, not for sure.
look, I thought my husband was dead.
and I felt like I died with him.
and I
I wanted to feel something-- anything.
and now I hate myself for it.
and the baby?
it's Rick's.
none of the rest of it matters.
then what's your concern?
memories are what keep me going now.
memories of what life used to be.
and I
I've got a deep well to draw on.
I still remember joy.
but I think carl's well is already running dry.
and this baby
the baby won't have any good memories at all,
only fear and pain.
you can't think like that.
we can still find joy
and we can still take strength from each other.
do you really think this baby has a chance,
that it could grow up and live a happy life?
look me in the eye and tell me
that my baby will grow up to be your age
and die happy.
tell me. Tell me you believe that.
I'm sorry. I'm-- it just came out. And it was dale.
it's okay. I never should have put you in that position.
I've been thinking about what you said
about needing help.
and you're right that I do.
name it. Yeah.
if you're still willing to make a run into town for me...
I'm your man.
thank you.
it's okay. It's not a big deal really.
you didn't have to come.
you could hate me from a distance.
please say something.
Maggie, I-- - I asked for your trust and you betrayed it.
now my dad's pissed at me.
your turn.
so your dad thinks they're sick?
you agree with that?
even after what you saw at the well?
I'm not sure what I saw at the well.
Yes, you are.
look, if you'd seen Atlanta,
you would not have a barn full of walkers.
I wish you'd stop calling them that.
what do you call them?
mom,
Shawn,
Mr. And mrs. Fischer, Lacey, Duncan.
what does she want now?
I can't say.
so when one of them asks you to keep your mouth shut...
crawl out of my butt
and help me look, please.
you've got to be kidding me.
No!
No! No!
Glenn!
Maggie! - Glenn, help me!
help! Glenn!
get it off me! Help!
did it get you? Did it bite you?
Glenn.
we're gonna have to go house to house.
we'll start at the far end and we'll work our way back.
if Sophia got this far, she has a real shot,
don't you think?
Hey! We got your stuff.
Maggie, hang on, please.
come on in here.
Why? Nothing to hide. We got your special delivery right here.
we got your lotion, got your conditioner, - Your soap opera digest. - Maggie.
next time you want something, get it your damn self.
we're not your errand boys. - Honey, I
and here's your abortion pills.
that was not cool. - Which part?
the part where that bitch almost got us killed?
I should've gone alone.
if you want to blame anybody, blame me.
right, take the blame.
you know, for a smart guy, you're really stupid.
okay, I'm confused,
because I think you just paid me a compliment, but you made it s
I've already lost three of the people
that I care about most in this world.
Maggie-- - shut up.
you're smart. You're brave.
you're a leader. But you don't know it.
and your friends don't want to know it.
they'd rather have you fetching peaches.
there's a dead guy in the well? Send glenn down.
you're walker bait.
I can't take you becoming one of them.
Sophia?
anyone?
Sophia?
they walled off the hallway?
they tried to make a stand here.
Sophia?
she was never here,
was she?
I don't know how to tell Carol this was another dead end.
come on, let's move.
cover that street. I'll clear the car.
Oh shit.
focus now. Clear the jam. Focus.
are you kidding me? - I got your back. Go.
Andrea, Andrea, let's go.
come on.
Andrea, come on.
the blood on Maggie's shirt
she was attacked.
are you guys all right? How bad was it?
it was pretty close.
I'm so sorry.
I should never have asked you to go.
I offered.
I thought the town was safe, but if you hadn't come back
but we did. I always do.
the morning-after pills-- will they even work?
I don't know.
and I don't know if I want them to.
then I got these too,
just in case.
prenatal vitamins.
that's a hell of a choice.
I'm glad it's not mine.
Lori, we're friends, aren't we?
with everything we've been through-- yeah.
I can't tell you what to do.
I could never tell you something like that.
but your choice
maybe you shouldn't make it alone.
come on then.
get over here. Get over here.
anything?
not today.
I'm so sorry.
we'll cover more ground tomorrow.
what happened out there?
um, I
the place was overrun. - Yeah.
let's go get you cleaned up.
Shane, shane,
I was thinking, you've got that nice new ride of yours, plenty of fuel, more than enough for you to get far from here.
what, you telling me to leave?
I know you've been planning to.
maybe now is a good time.
is this about Andrea?
I'm looking out for the group.
you think the group would be better off without me, Dale?
why don't you tell that to Rick or Lori?
their boy would be dead if I hadn't put my ass on the line.
and Otis's.
you've been vague about that night, about what happened.
Otis died a hero.
so you've said.
a little boy lived because of what went down that night.
I think you ought to show some gratitude.
I wasn't there. - No, man, you weren't.
but I was the time that you raised your gun on Rick.
come on. Jesus. - You had him in your sights
and you held him there.
I know what kind of man you are.
you think I'd shoot Rick?
that is my best friend.
that's the man that I love.
I love him like he's my a brother.
you think that's the kind of man I am?
that's right.
well, maybe we ought to just think that through.
say I'm the kind of man
who'd gun down his own best friend.
what do you think I'd do to some guy that I don't even like when he starts throwing accusations my way?
what do you think?
is there something you need to tell me?
we can't leave. I'm pregnant.
are you?
I threw them up.
you can yell if you want.
you can scream if you have to, but...
talk to me.
how long have you known?
does it matter?
days? Weeks? And you didn't tell me?
I'm telling you now. - No.
I found these.
so glenn knows, right?
instead of going to me, you sent him to get pills?
I panicked. You tell me we have no roof and no walls
do not put this on me!
you tear into me for keeping secrets when you're holding onto this?
you want me to bring a baby into this?
to live a short, cruel life?
how can you think like that?
we can't even protect the son we already have.
so this is the solution?
Rick, I threw them up.
I screwed up.
I don't know how we do this.
we can make it work.
how? Tell me how.
we'll figure it out.
shouldn't we try to figure it out?
you threw up the pills.
you want this baby. I know you do.
not like this.
not giving birth in a ditch.
not when its life will hang by a thread from the second it's born.
not when every cry will put it, and Carl, and everyone we care about, in danger.
that's not right.
not even giving it a chance isn't right either.
maybe this is why I didn't want to tell you.
I still-- I still don't understand why.
you really think I'd make you have a baby you don't want?
no, so that if I went through with it, it would be on my conscience and not yours.
maybe that's true, but
I can't live like this anymore,
Lori.
we can't live like this.
is there anything else i should know about?
Shane and I.
I know. Of course I know.
you thought I was dead.
the world went to shit and you thought I was dead.
right?
Yeah.
five mins - Yes all day.
dinner.
see You. - Bye.
we're not going to the Green Briar next week.
michael has to finish a policy paper and can't get away.
mommy, mommy, Chloe's teasing me!
I am not! She's teasing me, mommy!
didn't you need some time away from them?
Oh.Never.
I have to ask. -No, you don't.
when you picked up yesterday's outfit off the floor this morning,
did you think no one would notice?
no comment. - You're on the walk of shame.
you're holding my arm, so technically, it's our walk of shame.
although, it hardly seems fair you get the shame and no fun.
who is it?
that is so funny that you think I'm gonna tell you.
Hey. Conference room, guys.
Joan. The sound of your necklace gives you up.
I only like that trick when you do it to other people.
special activities division is en route to brief you.
this week, you belong to them, but we're goa let you operate out of here because...
not everyone has a braille keyboard and an embedded document reader with voice recognition?
because I know you like your desk arranged just so.
this drone is programmed to drop hellfire missiles on a meeting of all-star tribal leaders.
what's wrong with this picture?
no one was there. They knew we were coming.
this is the third mission in two weeks that has been compromised.
after the first, we shut down assets in Syria and Iraq...
to no avail. So it's happening on our side.
that was the theory. We also limited briefings to essential personnel in clandestine services.
mission details still got out. - Who could it be?
there's really only one possibility left. A United States senator.
more specifically, a member of the intelligence committee.
they have compartmented clearance higher than top secret.
only they have access to these missions.
I don't have to tell you all how big this is.
no member of the senate's been convicted for treason since 1797.
but how? The senate intelligence briefing room is secure.
no documents. Not even notes can be taken out.
well, that's where all of you come in.
each of you will use your undercover to gain access to a targeted senator.
Jai's running point on his.
okay. Read-in privileges. There are none.
this is completely off book.
if the senate knew we were spying on them in their own backyard,
we'd have another fisa situation.
why are we doing it?
because you're young and you're nobody.
you'll fit in perfectly on Capitol Hill.
who'd ya get? - Darton.
lame duck facing ethics charges. I like my chances.
I got Wallenberg.
isn't he the only one who opposed the war?
Oh, yeah. Who'd you get?
Gil jarvis. The committee chair.
he's not the leak. - Joan basically said that.
senator Jarvis's office. Please hold.
