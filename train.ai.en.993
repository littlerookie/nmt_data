Yeah, I'm here. I don't see any birds.
whistle or something.
do that come hither thing.
they came that fast because it's their behavior pattern.
Joe's been feeding them.
now look down. You see a river of pigeon turd?
Uh...no. There's barely any.
it's not weird, it's cheap.
Joe's a guy who looks for the easy way.
probably been stealing cable from his neighbors.
why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings?
you see a shovel or a dustpan?
Mmm, found a scraper. Looks used.
sitting on a bucket.
bucket full of pigeon crap. Perfect home for cryptococcus neoformans.
Yep.
fungus enters the brain through the sphenoidal sinus, where it dances its triple threat of happiness, blindness, and intractable pain.
let's hope this experience teaches our cop a lesson.
don't cut corners when you're growing your pot. See you back home.
I was there.
I should have found it.
Yeah, you could have saved us a lot of time.
get me a flush of ampho b and flucytosine.
I'll start us both.
I was waiting for lab confirmation. Haven't heard from House yet.
look at his eeg.
theta band's been increasing steadily since--since we put him under.
guy's unconscious, but still in pain.
theta bands could indicate at least half a dozen different things.
one of which is pain.
the fact that he's no longer screaming makes us feel better, not necessarily him.
chase! How's Cameron?
she's not giddy.
fever's down. White count's improving.
has she said anything to you?
you mean like, "I completely understand why Foreman did what he did, and I hold no grudge?"
what I did...did save my life.
get in here and help! Forget the suit!
he's tachycardic! Wide-complex looks like v-tach!
it's not cryptococcus!
What?--House was wrong. The samples were negative.
so what is it?
we don't know!--Give him in the amio.
do we have any more leads?
that was our lead! Foreman!
so the treatment isn't doing anything.
Foreman! He's in v-fib!
no good. Hit him again.
come on, man. Come on, Joe.
hit him again!
give him an amp of epi!
nothing!
he's has multiple-system failure.
come on, Joe.
Foreman! Time of death.
no.
time of death.
Hello!
Yes, this is Harold Angel.
Yes, initial A, like in the phone book.
excuse me?
hold on a second!
mackintosh. I've got it!
of course I know what an attorney is.
it's like a lawyer, only the bills are bigger.
sure, I'll hold.
asshole!
Hello, Mr. Winesap? Harold Angel.
Yeah, I could be free.
would this be with your firm?
gimme that again.
Louis . . . how do you spell that?
Cyphre . . . okay. What is it . . . foreign?
is your client a foreigner?
Mr. Winesap, could you give me a few more details?
okay, I know the place.
it's a long way up, but I can be there.
Hallelujah! Show right now how much you love God!
I want you to show! It's your time!
open up your hearts and open up your wallets!
open your purses!
open your pockets!
and give it up! Praise the Lord! Somebody has been talking about me riding around in a Cadillac. If you love me and want to give to me, then I should be in a Rolls-Royce!
would you come with me, please?
an unfortunate husband of one of Pastor John's flock took a gun to his head. Most unpleasant.
Mr. Angel? Please?
allow me to introduce my client, Monsieur Louis Cyphre.
Hi, Harry Angel. - Pleased to meet you, Mr. Angel.
I don't want to appear impolite, but do you have any l. D? - Sure! Here . . .
how's that?
gun PERMIT
nothing personal. I'm a little over-cautious.
you know how these things are. - I know. So . . .
how did you hear about me?
I guess you guys just looked in the phone book.
usually that's what happens. Because my name is "Angel," it's under "A" . . .
people are lazy. They see the first name and . . . - Johnny Favorite.
excuse me?
do you by chance remember the name Johnny Favorite?
Johnny . . . no, I don't think so.
you never knew him? - Am I supposed to?
he was a crooner before the war, quite famous in his way.
well, I tell you, Mr. Cyphre . . .
I'm sorry!
I usually don't get involved in anything very heavy. I usually handle insurance jobs, divorces, things of that nature.
if I'm lucky sometimes I handle people. But I don't know no crooners or anybody famous. - His real name was Liebling.
I don't know any Liebling, either.
what do you want from me?
does this man owe you money? - Not quite.
I helped Johnny at the beginning of his career.
you were like . . . his agent?
No!
nothing so . . .
Monsieur Cyphre has a contract.
certain collateral was to be forfeited in the event of his death.
,and his head and face was badly injured.
he had . . . - Amnesia. I think you call it . . .
shell shock. - Exactly! - I know how that feels.
Why? Were you in the services? - I was in for a short time.
but I got a little fucked up.
excuse me! They shipped me home, and I missed the whole shebang:
the war, the medals, everything. I guess you could say I was lucky.
Johnny wasn't so lucky. He returned home a zombie.
his friends had him transferred to a private hospital upstate.
there was some sort of radical psychiatric treatment involved.
but you know how it is.
he remained a vegetable, and my contract was never honored. - I see.
I don't want to sound mercenary.
my only interest in Johnny is in finding out if he's alive or dead.
each year my office receives a signed affidavit confirming that Johnny Liebling is indeed among the living.
but last weekend Monsieur Cyphre and l, just by chance, were near the clinic in Poughkeepsie.
we decided to check for ourselves, but we got misleading information.
the run-around!
I didn't want to cause a scene, I hate any sort of fuss.
I thought, perhaps you could subtly and in a quiet manner . . .
you want me to check it out. - Check it out!
I have a feeling I've met you before.
I don't know, I don't think so.
do you remember the name Johnny Favorite?
his real name was Liebling.
my only interest in Johnny is in finding out if he's alive or dead.
may I help you? - My name is Harry Conroy from the National lnstitute of Health.
is there anyone in particular you want to see?
the lnstitute is conducting a survey of incurable trauma cases.
I understand you have a patient here fitting that description?
we can't let you see anyone without an appointment.
I appreciate that, but maybe you could check the files and make sure I'm on the right track.
I don't want to bother anybody unnecessarily.
okay? Thank you.
what's the name of the patient? - Liebling, Jonathan Liebling.
one moment please, I'll check.
were you working here last weekend?
no, day off. - Did you do anything nice?
my sister's wedding.
we did have a Mr. Liebling, but he was transferred.
you sure? - That's what it says.
and when was that? - Years ago, in December '43.
may I take a look at this? Thanks.
is this recent?
it's an old file. - It's in ballpoint!
they weren't big on ballpoint in '43.
is that ballpoint?
well, I'll be! They didn't have ballpoints back then?
no.
this here
Dr. Fowler, does he still work here? - Just part-time, he's old.
thank you.
time for your evening fix?
who are you? How did you get in here?
through the mailslot. I'm a private detective.
breaking and entering is a crime, whoever or whatever you are. - Hey man, call the police!
which you won't do in case they discover your opium den in the icebox!
I'm a doctor. I'm perfectly entitled to keep pharmaceuticals at home.
tell it to somebody else! We're not talking about a Band-Aid or a tube of unguent. How long you been hooked? - What do you want?
information about Johnny Liebling.
I treated a patient of that name many years ago.
I'm not fooling around.
either you give me some answers or I'll call the police myself.
I've seen the works cooking upstairs, and it ain't Mr. Salk's vaccine.
he was an entertainer during the war, a neuro case.
no chance of recovery, so I transferred him to a V. A. hospital in Albany.
I hate to shake you up, but I checked, and he's not there.
you faked the transfer.
because he recently had a visitor, the first in 12 years.
popular guy, eh?
where is he now? - I don't know . . . - Come here!
I haven't seen him since he was a patient here.
you're in a cold sweat! Look at you!
you can't wait for me to leave so you can raid the icebox.
the sooner you get out with it, the sooner you can shoot up.
I'll ask you again: Where is he?
I don't know.
some people came one night years ago. He got in the car with them and left.
he got into a car? I thought this guy was a vegetable.
at first he was in a coma but he quickly recovered.
but he still suffered from amnesia.
the friends.
who were the friends? - His name was Kelley, Edward Kelley.
the young lady I don't know. She stayed in the car.
where did they take him? - Down South. The man said: "We're taking him home."
and what was the deal? - $25, 000.
for what? - I was supposed to pretend that he was still a patient in hospital.
didn't the administration suspect? - Why should they? I kept the charts up to date. And no one asks questions when the bills get paid.
tell me about Johnny Liebling.
what did he look like? - No idea. His face was damaged.
he had facial reconstruction. He was in bandages the day he left.
what can you tell me about Kelley?
it's too long ago. I only have a vague memory.
he was well dressed and had a southern accent.
I truly don't remember. - All right, Doc. Have a lie down.
I'm going out to grab a cheeseburger.
maybe a few hours cold turkey will refresh your memory.
watch yourself!
we're going to take a little nap, sit your ass down.
we're going to clear your mind.
I'm going out. When I get back,
I'll fix you some goodies from the icebox, alright?
tell me what I want to know and you'll get rid of me forever.
I'm back, Doc! I brought you a little something!
I didn't think you'd want a cheeseburger . . .
I will! Bye!
Hi, Ellie!
is that your boyfriend?
he's got a car and everything?
see you later!
did you see him? - No.
why not? - It would've been difficult. - Why?
Why? Because he's not there.
Johnny Favorite walked out of the clinic 1 2 years ago, in his best suit, with a new face wrapped in bandages and a headache.
he left with a guy called Kelley and a girl. Do you know this Kelley?
it seems this Kelley paid off some bent doctor called Fowler to pinch hit for your guy. He's covered up for him all these years.
looks like our Johnny has a perfect disappearing act. - It seems so.
but you know what they say about slugs.
no, what do they say about slugs?
they always leave slime in their tracks.
you'll find him. - No, I won't find him.
because I left out one little detail.
this Dr. Fowler ended up dead with his fucking brains blown out.
did you kill him? - No!
but the cops might think I did.
I took on a $1 25-a-day missing persons job for you.
now, I'm a murder suspect. That's it! I'm out.
such are the hazards of your profession. If the fee bothers you, we'll adjust it.
you bother me!
the closest I ever come to death is watching a hearse go by on 2nd Avenue. That's the way I like it.
are you afraid?
Yeah, I'm afraid.
I'll instruct my lawyer immediately to send you a check for $5, 000.
if you don't want the job, I'll engage someone else.
you want this Johnny pretty bad, eh?
I don't like messy accounts.
some religions think the egg is the symbol of the soul, did you know that?
no.
would you like an egg?
no, thank you. I got a thing about chickens.
it's after eleven, you're late. - I'm sorry.
you get it? - If I lose my job,
I'll come and be your secretary.
I couldn't pay you what the "Times" pays. Besides, they won't miss it.
Hi, Johnny, where the fuck are you?
he really was a crooner, like you said. I didn't realize he was so big.
he was in a band called the Spider Simpson Orchestra. They're all dead.
only Spider is here in town. - Where? - I wrote it all down.
the dyke in the archive is suspicious.
my boss hasn't researched the story in years.
you can get the files.
spider is in an old people's home on 138th Street.
Oh, I get to go to Harlem again.
there was a picture of Johnny with Toots Sweet, a guitar player.
no one's heard of him for years!
Johnny was engaged to a rich broad,
Margaret Krusemark. Her dad owns half of Louisiana.
met him at a high school prom. Johnny shit on her, and she went back to Daddy.
there's lots on their spells.
spells, what do you mean, spells?
the eye of a newt, toe of a frog and that kind of shit? - Seems she was a bit of a crackpot.
casting spells at society do's and stuff.
didn't go down too well with the lvy League stiffos.
she was known as the Witch of Wellesly.
did I do good?
great! So what've I got: A religious loonie as a client.
I gotta find Johnny "Golden Tonsils" and we don't know where he is.
and he probably doesn't know who he is.
I got a geriatric bandleader in a home in Harlem.
I got a guitar player called Toots Sweet.
what else have I got?
a hard-on?
are you okay?
january 3rd, 1 955. Client: Louis Cyphre. Copy: Winesap & Mackintosh, attorneys. As reported, Johnny Favorite has not been in the Sarah Dodd Clinic in Poughkeepsie for the last 12 years.
he was taken away by a man called Edward Kelley and a girl.
the girl is unidentified.
kelley paid a Dr. Fowler $25, 000 to falsify reports stating that Favorite was still in the hospital.
the doctor is now deceased.
before Johnny's accident it seemed like his career was going great, until he started to dump on everyone. I tracked down Spider Simpson,
Johnny's old bandleader. He resides at the Lincoln Presbyterian Hospice on 1 38th Street. Johnny also had a good buddy, a guitar player called Toots Sweet. Toots went back to Algiers.
that's Algiers in New Orleans.
I think maybe Margaret went back there, and maybe Johnny, too.
Oh, yeah! According to Spider, Johnny had a secret love.
a black lady called Evangeline Proudfoot.
Evangeline ran some kind of spooky store in Harlem called "Mammy Carter's.
you don't need to know that, Cyphre. I think a secret love should stay secret.
the only person who Johnny was seeing regularly was a palm reader in Coney lsland called Madame Zora.
are you lzzy?
looks like the last bit of sun, eh?
the guy in the arcade over there told me you might be able to help me.
I'm looking for Madame Zora. - I know her, friend of the wife before the war.
she was a fortune teller, right? - And then some!
I hate those hocus-pocus bitches! Her and the wife got along real well.
wife's a baptist. Oh, here!
have a nose shield!
go on, take one. I found a whole boxful under the boardwalk.
there's not much sun right now.
Yeah, but it keeps the rain off too.
ever hear of a Johnny Favorite?
the singer? - Yeah, he used to visit Madame Zora.
heard of him, but don't know nothing. Ask the wife.
she always sings stupid tunes off the radio. She knows all that shit.
she likes the water, eh? - She hates it.
she's getting on the heavy side. She thinks it's good for varicose veins.
alright, thanks.
what do you do here in the summer?
bite the heads off the rats.
and in the winter? - The same.
excuse me!
I was just talking to your husband.
I was inquiring about Madame Zora.
Yeah, I knew her before the war, Madame Zora, you say?
Yeah, she was a gypsy fortune teller!
had the booth across the boardwalk from me. She was a debutante not a gypsy, and she did more than just read tea leaves.
did you ever see her with a guy called Johnny Favorite? - Yeah, he was cute.
she was stuck on him. He was called "Golden Tonsils." I knew all his tunes.
have you ever heard of a Margaret Krusemark?
don't be a gazoony, fellah! Madame Zora was Margaret Krusemark.
well what happened to her?
packed up her stuff and went back home, down south.
you have any idea where I could find Johnny Favorite?
no, maybe the cemetery. Want to hear one of his tunes?
thanks for the nose shield. I'm going to need it where I'm going.
in Brooklyn? - Louisiana. - Nice.
Where'd he go?
for COLORED PATRONS ON LY
Mr. Angel? Sorry to keep you waiting, but you're a little early.
I had a bad line. I didn't know if you said 4: 00 or 4: 30.
this is a wild place you got here! - Yes, I've been very happy here.
I've never had my fortune read before. Does it take long?
I'll take the details now. It usually takes a couple of days to do a chart.
tea?
do you want some tea?
Yes, thank you.
darjeeling, jasmine or oolong?
not many people like oolong.
do you play the piano?
no, not exactly.
sing?
I can carry a tune, but no . . . not really.
who is this mean looking guy?
my father.
I'm sorry!
don't worry, he hates it too.
he looks like one of those guys in an old pirate movie. What's his name?
well, I tell you, I never saw any of Ethan's movies.
do you speak French?
I'm from Brooklyn.
I would prefer it if you didn't smoke. - That's okay.
cream or sugar?
straight up is fine, thank you.
I need your exact date of birth.
sure!
I was born on February 14th . . .
. . . 1918, on Valentine's day.
how curious! I used to know a boy who was born on that exact same day.
well, you know how it is.
maybe we could pull your friend's chart and save ourselves some time.
I don't think so. Every person is very different. I don't think you'd like his chart.
place of birth?
Brooklyn, New York. Was your friend a jerk or something?
you could say that.
I guess you didn't get along.
you and Johnny.
you and Johnny Favorite?
who are you? - I was an old army buddy.
I thought you two were kinda . . .
look, I ain't no army buddy, I'm just a guy who was paid to snoop around.
to tell the truth, I wasn't born on Valentine's day.
it's Johnny's future I'm interested in.
Johnny has no future, he's dead.
he died 1 2 years ago. I'd like you to leave.
I know you're thinking who is this creep poking his snitch in everything.
I don't want to sound nosy, but . . . - He's dead, Mr. Angel.
and if he isn't, he is to me.
he must've hurt you pretty bad!
we all have our scars.
I don't know too much about the guy, but he must've been stupid to let you go.
lies and cruelty come very easily to some people.
pity, I really would've liked to have gotten my palm read.
then I could have held your hand just a little longer.
I don't think you'd like what I see.
very pretty necklace!
you got any High John the Conquerer root? - Powdered or hanging?
I'm not really sure.
caught in the rain, eh?
two roots, $1 . 20.
I have a question. I had an acquaintance in Harlem who used to deal in the root.
name was Evangeline. Heard of her?
practically everyone around here is called Evangeline. After the poem.
do you know it?
Yeah, I know it.
this acquaintance had a store in Harlem and it was the same name:
Carter." - Everybody uses the name, mister.
like "Howard Johnson," but this is the real place.
her name was Proudfoot.
I knew her. She used to come back all the time when she lived in New York.
do you know where she is now? - She got sick and died.
she went back to the Holy Shelter swamp and was buried in Armandville.
she was waiting on some fellah. - Just like in the poem? - Yep.
who was the guy? - She never told.
okay, thanks.
a week, you say? - At the most.
what is it?
why are you crying?
we're going to Grandma. What's there?
grandma.
grandma.
let's go.
give me your hand.
I'm sorry! I got these off a guy in Coney lsland.
some crazy guy.
I'm sorry.
stop crying.
I was hoping I could talk with your mother.
you're a little late. Did you know her?
no, I never met her but I was hoping she could answer some questions for me.
are you a cop?
no, my name is Harry Angel.
I'm a private detective.
so what's . . ? - Epiphany.
your mama left you with a very beautiful name.
and not much else.
actually, I'm looking for a friend of your mother's, a guy called Johnny Favorite.
I met all her friends but never anyone called Favorite.
shit!
I got a thing about chickens.
this Favorite was friends with your mother in New York city before the war.
well, she never told me. Mama had a lot of guys. She liked men.
how about a guy called Toots Sweet?
he was a friend of Favorite. Know him? - No. - He was a good guitar player.
I was going to catch his act tonight.
I'm going to be staying in town, in a hotel.
if you remember anything that might help me, give me a call.
you're a very pretty girl, Epiphany, your name suits you.
these crazy chickens!
what are you after him for, Johnny Favorite?
I'm not after him. I'm just being paid to find out where he is.
he could be 6 feet under. - Then I'll have to buy a shovel.
how are you, sugar?
some beautiful tune you were singing there, Mr. Sweet. - Toots, son! Thanks. - Buy you a drink?
mine's on the house. Special cocktail. Whatever's in it gives a big kick.
you know, I heard you play years ago in New York.
before the war at the old Dickie Wells Bar.
you were having it up pretty good with a guy called Johnny Favorite.
Yeah, I vaguely remember. - You and he were buddies, weren't you?
no, he recorded one of my songs. Say, are you a dick or a book writer?
neither. I'm a journalist and I'm doing this piece about Johnny and the Spider Simpson Orchestra.
spider played them drums like two jackrabbits fucking!
haven't got much time. Got to piss, spit and get back to work.
try one of those cocktails. Then you can make the whole thing up as you like.
that's what you usually do, anyway.
I can't even take a piss!
I just wanted to talk about Johnny Favorite and Evangeline Proudfoot.
I'm too big to go hiding under beds. I don't know nothing.
I'm only interested in cocktails. Fuck!
what's going on? - Nothing! Mind your own business. I want to piss!
get outta here, or you'll wish your little white ass was never born.
please! I've got a thing about chickens.
end of bullshit time!
I've had a good look at you and young Epiphany doing your hot shoe number with the chicken.
listen!
I ain't up on this voodoo shit. I'm from Brooklyn.
we ain't all Baptists here. - What's with this Proudfoot girl?
she's a mambo priestess, like her mom. Has been since she was 1 3.
when was the last time you saw Johnny Favorite at a chicken dance?
he used to run around with Ma mambo. - I ain't seen him since before the war.
and the chicken foot in the john? - It means I got a big mouth.
it's not big enough. What's this fucking star in your mouth? I'll tell you what.
I'll give you my hotel number. Gimme a call if you hear anything.
you never know.
next time you get a delivery of a chicken foot, you might need help.
as far as I'm concerned, any dead chicken is a good chicken.
only cops and bad news don't knock.
only private dicks sleep late.
quite a dream you were having! - I was on my way to Mandalay.
shit! There's some leak up there!
here! ls this your name?
that your hotel?
you're standing in it, ain't you? - Your handwriting?
I think so.
then perhaps you can tell us why we found it in the hand of a dead guitar player.
Toots Sweet is dead?
this one wasn't so quick, this one took time.
how did he die?
technically? Asphyxiation by his own genitalia.
and not so technically?
they cut his dick off and choked him with it.
then redecorated his apartment with his blood.
when did you see him? - I interviewed him around 1: 00. - About what?
a missing person.
who?
a guy who took a walk 1 2 years ago.
there was a photo of him and Toots. - Who is the party you're looking for?
I can't say. I'm working for a New York lawyer.
name? - Come on, man!
Winesap! You want his number, his address?
ask Tess Truehart over there, it's in the book.
under "W," genius! - Do you know Ted Williams, the baseball player?
alright, is that it, guys?
that's it.
you can go eat lunch, but don't stroll too far.
not until we talk to this lawyer.
ever watch the "Mickey Mouse Club"?
do you know what today is?
today is Wednesday.
it's "anything can happen" day.
hey man, do you want a tune?
Yeah, I got a tune for you.
Hiya, boys!
I'm getting kinda hungry.
do you want to sell some of those?
10 cents a sack. - Sure, give me a sack.
listen good! Margaret Krusemark's old man wants you on the first train home.
take that fucking thing away from me!
don't, or the dog will bite your fucking face clean off.
what happened to you?
a dog bit me.
so, what do you want?
right now, I need a laundry.
listen, Epiphiny . . . - Epiphany.
there's something I want to ask you.
the other night I saw you and Toots boogying with the cock-a-doodle.
looked like you were having some party.
what's your problem? It's a free country.
not for chickens. - Oh yeah, your thing about chickens.
listen, Toots is . . .
Toots is dead. - I know, I heard.
you set him up. - No, I didn't.
you were the only one that knew I was seeing Toots.
you sent the gift-wrapped chicken foot, didn't you?
Toots had a big mouth.
I guess he did, judging by what the cops found in it.
quite a cute religion! - Nailing a man to a cross ain't so cute either!
you've got to kill the chicken to make the soup, eh?
we don't go around murdering people. What about your Johnny Favorite?
now you remember him after all. - Yes, he was my father.
I'll pick the baby up later, okay? - He'll be all right.
anything you're holding out, now is a good time to tell.
nothing to tell.
Johnny never came back from the war.
mama waited and Mama died. Sad and simple.
there's too many dead bodies floating around, even for Louisiana.
I'd tell your old man to look out for you.
you do have a husband? - No.
no?
Jesus, you've got beautiful eyes!
really.
the kind of eyes that tell what's going on inside.
right now, you're scared. - I'll manage.
listen . . . - Yes, I'll call you if I hear anything.
call me if you don't.
alright?
I have a message for you.
thank you. - You're welcome.
I'm so glad you could come. - I didn't know you were in town.
I'm speaking in Baton Rouge and thought I'd catch up on your progress.
I'll tell you, the progress ain't too good.
I've found out a lot of stuff, but so far . . . no Johnny Favorite.
how unfortunate! - All I've got is a belly full of hocus-pocus and . . .
3 stiffs.
dead bodies, Mr. Cyphre.
murders.
I got Fowler, Johnny's doctor, bumped himself off.
this old voodoo guy Toots Sweet.
he got choked to death with a part of the body meant for pissing with . . .
this is a church!
the whole thing has to do with religion. It's very weird.
I don't understand it. It's ugly.
they say there's enough religion to make men hate each other but not love.
do they say that?
I'll tell you something. There wasn't much love around for Johnny Favorite.
he was bad luck!
it's starting to rub off on me. I'm a murder suspect already in two cases.
the police found my name and my address in Toots Sweets' hand.
I know, Winesap told me. You must be careful, Mr. Angel.
and the third murder?
I checked out Johnny's old society girlfriend, Margaret Krusemark.
do you know her? - Vaguely.
Vaguely? I'm a little fed up with fucking vaguely.
Vaguely" is putting a noose around my neck and I'm choking, so . . .
did you know her or not?
I knew about her, but I never actually knew her.
tell you what, she was doing my chart.
I gave her Johnny's birthday, February 14th.
except someone got to her and took out their own Valentine's card.
they slit her open and cut out her heart.
I guess she couldn't predict the future for herself.
the future isn't what it used to be.
and your conclusions? - I haven't any.
all I know is that Johnny is running around bumping off everyone he knew.
and more and more, it's me who's on the line for it.
I'm being set up and it's scaring the shit out of me.
so why don't you just level with me and tell me what the fuck is going on?
just Johnny Favorite and the debt that's owed to me.
I have old-fashioned ideas, about honour.
an eye for an eye, things like that.
who the fuck are you?
watch your language!
I don't give a fuck, if this is a church.
I don't like churches. - Are you an atheist?
Yes, I'm from Brooklyn.
I'll be in town for a day or two, let me know what else you find, and if you need more money . . . - No!
but if I'm not careful, that 5, 000 bucks you gave me could buy me a seat on the electric chair.
frightened eyes never lie.
come on! Come inside!
Where's your child? - He's at Mincie's. She'll bring him.
she's got 14 of her own, so he'll be okay there.
you're welcome to stay here, or I can get you a room.
no, it's okay.
I'm going to have a drink. Want one?
well, have one anyway.
I've been thinking . . .
what the hell did your mother see in a guy like Johnny Favorite?
I don't know. Whatever he had, it sure stole her heart away.
to tell you the truth, the guy was a creep.
she sure missed him.
what does a lady see in a guy who runs around chopping up pigeons?
they say it's always the bad-asses who make a girl's heart beat faster.
did she ever say anything about him?
just two things. - What?
that Johnny Favorite was as close to true evil as she ever wanted to come.
what else?
that he was a terrific lover.
how old are you?
kind of young to have a kid, isn't it?
old enough.
where did the father go? - I never knew him.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I took this room.
I can't believe this!
it was a Bambouche. When spirits possess you, it's called "chevalier."
I know that: Chevrolet.
Chevalier. - That's what I said: Chevrolet. - Mounted by the gods.
so the gods got you pregnant? I understand now. I'm sorry.
I'm not. It was the best fuck I ever had.
want to dance?
here?
Yes, here.
I got bit by a dog this morning, I can't move around.
you won't feel a thing.
alright, I'll dance with you.
but you've got to promise. - What's that? - No chickens!
alright, I'm coming!
I should've recognised the knock.
at least you got a reason for sleeping late.
down here we don't mess with jigaboos. The colored folks keep to themselves.
I'm not from down here. - You cut yourself?
dog bit me.
somebody called Margaret Krusemark figure in your missing persons case?
no, why? - She's dead. That nigger guitar player of yours, he didn't matter a shit. He was into voodoo.
but this Krusemark dame, she comes from a Louisiana money family.
two people bumped off in a week, what's the connection?
similar circumstances!
did she have her dick cut off too? - No!
some fucker cut her heart out, neat as a butcher.
look, mine's a missing persons, it's not a murder.
I want the name of the party you're looking for. - Talk to the lawyer.
I did. A fancy mouthpiece, gave me the same big city shit as you.
what should I say? Why don't you and Effie Klinker just fuck off and leave me alone? - You ass-wipe!
you play jump rope with Louisiana law and I'm going to stick your big city smarts right up your New York ass.
this Krusemark was into black magic and all that shit.
nothing is worse for a cop than people who get killed for nutso reasons.
sorry about the mess. Maybe your nigger can clean it up.
what are you singing?
it's by Johnny Favorite. My mother used to sing it all the time.
you okay?
shit!
what do you want, Mr. Angel?
I thought you knew. - Why should l?
two of your morons with a matching poodle have been chasing me for days.
I'm looking for Johnny Favorite.
as far as I know, that dance band scumbag is dead.
that dance band scumbag probably killed your daughter.
who is employing you? - I can't say.
I'll pay. - So do they.
12 years ago, you and your daughter snatched Favorite from the nut hatch.
you gave a junkie doctor 25 grand to pretend Johnny was still there.
you did a good job until a week ago.
you used the name Edward Kelley.
let's go over here. It's a little private and you can sample our Gumbo.
I've got an acid stomach. Cajun cooking kills me.
pity about your stomach! You'd have enjoyed our Gumbo.
I was Edward Kelley. It was me who paid Fowler the 25 grand.
did Favorite know you? - No.
he acted like a sleep walker. He looked out of the window at the lights.
where were you taking him? - Times Square. New Years Eve, '43.
we dropped him off in the crowd, and he disappeared forever.
or so we thought.
you're telling me you paid 25 grand for a guy and lost him in a crowd?
I did it for my daughter.
some sort of hocus-pocus she and Johnny were fooling with. She was obsessed.
I know, I found a mummified hand in her room.
the hand of glory. It's supposed to open any lock.
it was the right hand of a murderer, cut off while his neck was in the noose.
that's what Margaret believed.
black magic! - Black, white, what's the difference? Margaret was always . . .
evil. - Evil as a dunghill.
everyone speaks about someone else. Margaret wasn't evil.
she was a strange kid! She was into Tarot cards before she could read.
who got her started? - Some maid, or governess, who knows.
everything you tell me is a crock of shit!
you got her started!
you're a devil worshipper! - The Prince of Darkness protects the powerful.
shit! - I can't help if you don't believe it.
come straight with me, you slime-bag, or I'll save the state an execution!
I introduced Johnny Favorite to my daughter.
I watched him conjure up Lucifer in my home. He was deeper in it than me.
he made a pact with Satan. He sold his soul.
you expect me to swallow that? - I don't give a damn!
that's a crock of shit, you lying toad!
he sold his soul for stardom. - For stardom?
Satan rose from the depths.
but he tried to outwit the Prince of Darkness.
when he made it big, he tried to duck out of it.
that's a crock of shit!
Johnny found an obscure rite in an ancient manuscript. He needed a victim.
someone his own age. - Why? - To steal their soul.
Toots and Johnny picked up a young soldier.
who? - Just a soldier celebrating New Year's Eve in New York.
they took him back to Johnny's hotel, where they had the ceremony.
what ceremony?
the boy was bound naked on a rubber mat, there were complicated incantations.
a pentacle was branded on his chest.
Margaret gave Johnny a virgin dagger.
he sliced the boy clean open and ate his heart.
it was still beating when he wolfed it down.
Johnny wanted to become that soldier.
before he had worked it out, he was drafted, injured and sent home without even knowing who he was.
who was the boy?
only Johnny knew. He put the dog tags in a vase and gave it to Margaret.
it was Margaret's plan to drop him off in Times Square.
the last place he remembered before it happened.
he needed a victim. Someone his own age.
to steal their soul.
he sliced the boy clean open and he ate his heart.
who was the boy?
Johnny wanted to be the soldier.
maybe he gained the guy's soul, but he still looked like Johnny to me.
I know who I am!
alas . . .
how terrible is wisdom if it brings no profit to the wise, Johnny.
even your name is a dime store joke.
Mephistopheles" is such a mouthful in Manhattan, Johnny.
do you think posing as the devil, just because it scared a superstitious old guitar player, and that witch, and that nutty old man, do you think it's going to scare me? It ain't, because I know who I am.
you killed them, and you're trying to pin it on me.
I know who I am.
if I had cloven hooves and a tail, would you be more convinced?
you're crazy.
I know who I am. You're trying to frame me.
you're trying to frame me.
I know who I am. You murdered them people! I never killed nobody!
I didn't kill Fowler,
I didn't kill Toots, and I didn't kill Margaret or Krusemark.
I killed no one.
I'm afraid you did, Johnny. - My name's not Johnny!
all killed by your own hand. Guided by me, naturally.
you were doomed from the moment you slit that young boy in half.
you've been living on borrowed time and another man's memories for 1 2 years.
I want to tell Winesap, he knows! - He's dead.
nasty accident!
don't worry, no one will mourn one less lawyer. Death's everywhere these days.
but what gives human life its worth, anyway?
because someone loves it, hates it.
the flesh is weak. Only the soul is immortal.
and yours belongs to me!
I know who I am.
that's it Johnny, take a good look!
however cleverly you sneak up on the mirror, your reflection always looks you straight in the eye. - I know who I am.
I know who I am!
why did you come back?
I live here.
who is she?
she ain't: Angel, Harold.
she's my daughter.
bullshit! Who is she?
she stayed here for a little while.
long enough for you to kill her? Or ain't that your gun up her snatch?
you're going to burn for this.
I know.
in hell!
Gaby, I'm getting married.
and I was married when we got together.
that is not how I'm gonna be married.
Lynette got the support she needed for chemotherapy.
Katherine, who liked everything in its place...
Yeah, I've seen a lot of cable, so I get it.
I hope we can live up to your stereotype.
I should go.
the odd-Looking boxes were delivered to the home of Bob Hunter and Lee Mcdermott early on a Tuesday morning.
it wasn't long before workmen had opened them and begun assembling the various parts and pieces.
happily, it only took three hours to turn the contents into a finished work of art.
sadly, it only took 15 minutes for e residents of Wisteria Lane...
what the hell is it?
to become art critics.
I think it's a sculpture.
I think it's crap.
of a the gay men in the world, we have to get the two without taste.
what are we gonna do about this?
I say we keep smiling and look for the hidden cameras.
I think we're about to get punk' d.
I don't think there's anything we can do.
it's not our lawn.
it's our neighborhood,
and we have rules against this sort of thing,
or at least we did when I used to live here.
who's running the homeowners association?
well, it was Mary Alice, but as you may have heard...
and a husband who's been looking for the doorknob.
what? You've met him.
Ooh! They're coming.
good morning, ladies. - Hi.
uh, we were just talking about your sculpture.
that's what I love about art-- The way it provokes discussion.
although it would've been nice if you had discussed it with us.
what, you don't-- You don't like it?
well, we're not saying that.
it's just a little, uh...It's an eyesore.
Really?
you hear that, Bob?
we flew to Finland and paid $24,000 to commission an eyesore.
I don't mind it.
not to brag, but I went to art school.
community college.
and they taught us that art is subjective.
thank you, Susan.
Susan's need for approval aside, this clearly is not appropriate for the street.
Wisteria Lane has a traditional look.
well, maybe you'd like it better if we covered it with a gingham throw.
ladies, uh, I'm sorry.
we honestly thought that people would like it, but even if you disapprove, we hope that you will respect our right to decorate as we see fit.
have a nice day, Philistines.
Yes, art came to Wisteria Lane on a Tuesday morning, and by Tuesday afternoon...I think it's time to reconvene the homeowners' association.
all in favor?
Aye.
war had come as well.
as word of the sculpture spread, Bob and Lee began to wonder if any of their neighbors would be supportive.
but when the sculpture's true function was unveiled the next day, whatever support they did have...was quickly washed away.
come on.
it's 6: 00 a.m.
what is that?
I don't know, but make it stop.
Oh, my God.
it's a fountain, too.
we would have mentioned that yesterday, but your friends were a little uptight.
Yeah, they can get like that.
so do you think that you can just turn it off for a second?
what's up?
I was just wondering, um, do you think you could move it to your backyard?
Why? I thought you liked it.
remember? You said,"art is subjective."
Yes.
quiet art is subjective,
but you see, Mike is working really long hours lately, and he can't sleep with all that noise.
we're not gonna turn it off
because we need it to drown out all the stuff we hear coming from your house.
like what?
let's see. You yakking to your mom on the phone.
you grunting through your Pilates DVDs.
you in the shower, butchering the score to Brigadoon.
I have a lovely voice.
whoever told you that is not your friend.
he's a little cranky.
I think someone needs his French toast.
come on, Lee.
no, no, no, no. No, no, we're not done here.
as your neighbor, i have a right to be heard...
and I say that simple human decency dictates that you turn off that fountain right now!
Hey, guys.
do over, Parker.
Hey, guys, I got your snack.
what you playing?
action figures.
wanna play, mom?
she does awesome alien voices.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Hello?
Oh, yeah. Hi, Dr. Iller.
okay, that's my white blood count.
Uh-huh, but as long as it's higher than 4.0, That means I don't have neutropenia, right?
well, that's great.
thanks for calling.
Yeah, you, too.
Bye.
what?
you can't talk about doctors up here.
or about being sick.
if you do, you have to go.
that's the rule.
well... that's a good rule.
although it wasn't bad news.
it was actually-- - Doesn't matter.
we voted.
it's a rule.
got it.
sick talk done, okay?
you guys have fun.
freeze power.
do over, Parker.
that guy doesn't have freezing power.
if his guy can fly, my guy can freeze.
Hi. It's, uh Mrs. Hodge.
may I please speak with Danielle?
muffins.
hands off.
we're bringing these to Dielle for her birthday.
what do you mean, she's gone?
and you believed her?
you idiot!
I should sue your irresponsible yeah, Well, good day to you, too, reverend mother!
what happened?
those stupid nuns at the convent let Danielle's grandmother kidnap her.
she claimed I'd given her permission for a weekend visit.
it's me.
you can screen your calls all you want to, but trust me, old woman, you are in a world of trouble.
I know where you live, and I am coming for you.
shouldn't we be worried?
no, I think we're ready for her.
now show me again how you kill the zombies.
why can't I go?
I play golf.
and I'd love to meet you...College buddies.
Edie, me and the guys have only two rules for these weekends?
no women
fine.
be that way.
and to think, I got you a gift.
Hey, golf balls.
they're monogrammed.
wait. These are your initials.
exactly.
while you're out there playing, want everyone to know who your balls belong to.
good work, boys, but I have to head out in a few minutes, so make sure you put all the stuff back in the garage.
Hello?
Hey, on my way.
meet you at the hotel, okay?
I'm leaving in five minutes.
uh, Brett, could you come here a second?
how long has that van been parked over there?
couple hours.
hours?
are you serious?
Oh, my God.
I think he's just waiting for someone to come home.
Brett, when's the last time a cable guy waited for anyone?
I see a lot of lawn mowing in your future.
Hey, it's me again.
you're not gonna believe this.
before Victor left on his business trip, he hired someone to tail me.
Oh, man. Should we call this off?
no way.
it's gonna take more than a guy with mini binoculars and a bag of doughnuts to keep me under lock d key.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
boys, time to get paid.
come on, Eddie!
come back here!
are you taking the bus home?
as soon as we get around the corner, we're gonna have to adjust this horn.
Gabrielle. Hey.
h-hi.
look at you.
what a surprise.
Oh, uh, this is Gaby.
this is my wife Tammy.
Tammy, this is Gabrielle.
wow, look at you.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
it wasn't planned.
okay.
so... are you guys staying here?
no, we just came for some lunch.
daddy owns this place.
that's right.
you're a hotel heiress.
Yeah, but not one of the skanky ones.
how do you two know each other?
I used to be Gabrielle's gardener.
Oh! Well, as you can see, he's certainly married up from lawn boy.
Tammy. - What?
forget it.
so I heard you married the mayor.
you're married to Victor Lang?
he and daddy go hunting together.
I told John if he would just be nicer to daddy, he could hang out with people like the mayor and make important contacts.
and I keep telling you that I don't need to kiss your father's ass to have a career.
uh, yeah, so I married the mayor.
kooky, huh?
so, um, is he here with you?
uh, no.
he's away at a conference, so I decided to treat myself to a spa weekend.
you should definitely get the full body massage.
Oh, I plan to.
good to see you.
you, too, Gaby.
sorry about that.
a complete shock. I mean, of all people to run into.
who were they?
just an old friend and his idiot wife.
come on. Let's go.
Bree, how lovely to see you.
cram it, Phyllis.
you got a lot of nerve stealing Danielle from a convent we prepaid for.
she didn't steal me.
I'm a mature person capable of making my own decisions.
well, good. You can decide to pack, because we are taking you back to the convent.
I'm turning 18 this weekend, so you can't boss me around anymore.
I'm staying with grandma,
and I'm gonna have my baby delivered here.
we have an excellent medical staff.
it's a retirement village.
all these doctors know how to deliver is bad news.
I don't care.
I'm staying, and I'm gonna raise the baby here, too.
what?
entirely her idea.
a baby is god's most precious gift.
I will not have mine raised by a cold, emotionally unavailable woman like you.
emotionally unavailable.
gosh, I wonder where she picked up that little phrase.
like I'm too dumb to think of it myself?
you're always mean to me, just like you were to dad.
you emasculated him.
well, you're not gonna emasculate me.
you don't even know what that means, you petulant sock puppet!
who cares?
I'm going to the store.
buy a dictionary.
so that's all settled.
would you like some iced tea?
you aren't joining the lunch mob?
uh, you mean Katherine's homeowners thing?
Yeah, I think I'll sit this one out.
no, no, no. You can't do that.
you've got to pick a side.
art or mindless conformity?
see, this is one of the upsides of having cancer.
you get to excuse yourself from petty neighborhood squabbles.
you won't think they're so petty when she comes after you.
me?
why would she do that?
did the homeowners' association approve everything in your yard?
the fence?
that swing?
the tree house?
I don't think Katherine will bother herself over a tree house.
first, they came for the fountains, and I did not speak out because I had no fountain.
what?
then they came for the lawn gnomes, And I did not speak out because I had no gnome.
you're comparing Katherine to a Nazi?
then they came for my tree house,
and there was no one left to speak out for me.
thank you, ladies.
I so appreciate your input, and I think we can all agree that the fountain has no place on our street.
Yeah, we gotta show those gays we mean business.
Ida, again, the issue is not Bob and Lee being gay.
it's t fountain.
well, can't it be both?
anyway...
if you elect me president, my first act will be to eliminate the so-called work of art.
hear, hear.
Yes, Lynette.
after you get rid of this fountain, that's it, right?
I don't follow.
I mean...You're not gonna start checking everyone's yards for things that don't fit in?
Oh, of course not.
as long as those things meet the association's guideline.
and what if they don't?
are you referring to something in particular?
my kids' tree house.
can you promise you'll leave it alone?
well, it's not up to me.
that's the whole point.
there are rule that sounds like a no.
if I make an exception for you, then I have to make one for everyone,
and surely, you realize that the whole neighborhood can't revolve around your little tree house.
now since I am running unopposed, I just need someone to second my nomination.
Oh! Thank you, Lynette no, actually, I'm nominating myself.
I am now running for president...
against you.
you know, running for president in your condition?
I don't think it's a good idea.
Tom, I don't want your opinion, just your vote.
if you want to save the tree house, why don't you let me run instead?
because you'd never win.
bossy women rule this street. You know that.
I know one rules my life.
I'm sorry. I didn't catch that.
nothing.
look, this is not just about a tree house or a fountain.
this is about what kind of neighborhood we want to live in.
do we get to make our own choices, or do we let the taste police make them for us?
Ah, now I get it.
this about you wanting to take on Katherine.
No!
this is about personal freedom?
honey, if you're looking for something to fight, how about your cancer?
Hey, a tumor is a tumor whether it's in your body or living across the street.
I don't know why you buy those things.
they just end up on the floor.
because I want to feel pretty and feminine.
my chili cheese fries!
just a second!
it's me--John.
John who?
uh, okay.
you know that old friend I ran into in the lobby?
it might have been John Rowland.
maybe.
I'm not sure.
but just to be safe, you may wanna hide in the closet.
what? I'm not hiding from that guy.
Really?
because his father-In-Law goes hunting with Victor?
John, what are you doing here?
when I ran into you last fall, you wanted to start up our affair again, and I wasn't ready.
well, I'm ready.
Hey.
listen, I promised Tom I wouldn't knock myself out campaigning for this homeowners thing, so I was hoping you could help me?
I would love to, but...
but what?
this is awkward.
uh, I told Katherine I'd vote for her.
you're picking her over me?
uh, it's not like I'm pro-Katherine.
I'm just anti - fountain.
Oh, don't give me that look.
I made her a promise.
okay.
if I vote for you, do you promise to get rid of that fountain?
see, that's awkward for me.
this is about personal freedom. You know?
I'm running as a libertarian.
well, I'm voting as a light sleeper.
it's right outside our bedroom window.
seriously, Lynette, it's like living next to splash mountain.
but it's my kids' tree house.
they really need it.
well, we need our sleep.
why don't you get earplugs?
why don't you get...tree house plugs?
what?
that doesn't even make sense.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
you know, tired people aren't witty.
seriously, John, you have got to get out of here.
no.
please.
I need to be with you.
what about your wife?
you met her.
she's dumb, demanding, totally self-centered, especially in bed.
I mean, she's awful.
awfully pregnant.
I know.
I-I'm completely trapped, just like you were with Mr. Solis.
what...
I-I wasn't trapped.
what do you mean?
all you'd ever talk about was what a selfish pig he was.
well, I think you're paraphrasing.
okay, seriously, you have to go.
come on.
you know it could be hot, just like old times.
remember how great our sex was?
Oh, I don't think we need to get into that.
what about the time we were doing it in the shower?
Mr. Solis drove up?
uh, does not ring a bell.
come on.
and I hid the closet?
and you looked so hot, Mr. Solis pulled you down on the bed.
and you had to fake an orgasm just so he wouldn't catch on.
Yeah, good times.
anyways, uh, that's a negatory on the affair... - What?
and I will see you later.
come on, but we're so good together.
Gaby-- Please!
boy, that was a close one, huh?
you faked it with me while that wax job was hiding in the closet?
Yes, I had an affair.
old news. Move on.
Where's that room service?
so you're not gonna apologize for humiliating me in my own bed?
you deserved it.
all you cared about back then was work.
Hey, I was not that bad of a husband, and somebody had to support your Italian shoe addition.
I shopped because I was bored and lonely?
Yeah, with our teenage gardener!
I should have snapped that kid's neck two years ago.
Oh, let it go!
John Rowland didn't do anything to you that you're not doing to Victor.
you can't even compare the two!
it's completely different!
is it, Mr. Man in the closet?
Yeah, you heard me.
who's John Rowland now?
Katherine, what are you up to?
just visiting a friend.
liar.
you're campaigning.
Cookies--Nice touch.
Ditto on the scarf.
Edie, you got a moment?
I am running for president of the homeowners' association,
and I want to talk to you about that horrible fountain.
screw the fountain.
you want my support?
make Ida Greenberg ditch that screen door.
looks fine to me. It's hardly ripped at all.
in fact, if you give me your support...I'll make Mrs. Burkette prune those roses.
it's a garden, not a jungle, and you shouldn't have to...pay for a fence you don't even want.
that's not how you make good neighbors, and I don't care if...The Mustafas don't celebrate Christmas.
you're asking them to hang a few lights, not convert.
when I'm president, I promise...you can keep that satellite dish.
in fact, this is practically a first amendment issue.
the way I see it...the entire neighborhood should be a testament to symmetry and beauty.
So...Have I got your vote?
um, I'm not sure yet.
keep rubbing.
Bree, I know you're upset, but you've got to eat.
I'm just so mad at myself.
I should have realized is so strong, that even Danielle would develop it.
what's so funny?
you know those animals who eat their young?
even they have more maternal instinct than Danielle.
then why would she want the child?
you've known her how long, And you still haven't figured out how that lentil she calls a brain works?
there's no need to insult your sister. - Let him talk.
all right, Danielle cares about three things
Danielle, fun, and, uh...
wait. I was wrong. It's just two.
and a retirement village is fun?
compared to what you're offering her?
a crappy job and county college.
I mean, you think grandma's gonna make her do any of that?
so Danielle's only doing this because Phyllis is offering her a cushy life?
Yeah.
if you want that baby, you're gonna have to outbid grandma.
what are you doing here?
Hi, John.
I wanted to talk to you.
it'll be very friendly. No hitting.
what's up?
this is gonna sound weird, But, uh, I've been doing some thinking lately,
and, well, I've decided that it's time for me to forgive you.
for sleeping with my wife.
Yeah, well, I didn't just sleep with Gaby.
I fell in love with her.
I forgive you for that, too.
why are you doing this?
you in some kind of 12-Step program?
let's just say I've recently learned
how loving someone makes you forget the difference between right and wrong.
anyway, that's pretty much it. I should go.
Hey.
do you still talk to Gabrielle?
occasionally. Why?
I just want to know if she was happy.
I think she is.
well...
good for her.
all right, before we vote, are there any more questions for the candidates?
anybody besides Lee? - It's not a question.
I just want to remind everyone that a vote for Katherine is a vote for fascism.
what is it with you gay people and clothes?
fascism, Ida, not fashion.
although if you ever do want to talk fashion, we're here for you.
all right, debate's over.
all in for Lynette okay, and those for Kathrine?
that's 14 for Lynette and 14 for Katherine.
so what do we do? It's a tie.
Ah!
no, it's not. Susan voted twice.
did I?
well, that's obviously wrong.
you only get one vote, sweet cheeks. Who's it gonna be?
Susan, we're waiting.
it's up to you, honey.
Katherine. - Oh!
okay, it's official. Katherine is our new president.
thank you.
thank you, everyone, and I promise to do my best for this neighborhood.
and, Bob, Lee, Mr.Mustafa, I'll be in touch regarding your various infractions.
Oh. And you, too, Lynette.
meeting adjourned.
Oh.
I'm sorry you know, Phyllis, we cannot thank you enough for accepting our apology.
well, I think we should try to stay on good terms for Danielle's sake.
I'm glad you suggested that we eat out here.
I never think to do this.
Oh, damn, I forgot the napkins. - Oh, no problem.
I'll go get some.
so now that we have a moment alone,
your mother and I would like to say how proud we are of you.
Yeah, right.
seriously, we hadn't realized you'd matured enough well yourself grandma's gonna help.
she'll do what she can, but you mustn't overtax her.
her heart is not very strong.
she seems nice to me.
well, knock wood.
we'd hate to see you forced to take care of a baby and a sick old woman.
Whoa! Mah-Jongg.
don't see that much anymore.
Hey, hey.
Danielle, you should introduce yourself.
these people are your new friends.
and you're going to learn more from their experience and wisdom
than you ever could have learned at that college in Florida.
wait. I thought I couldn't go there.
you said it was just a party school.
well, actually, we checked into the curriculum, and it's very strong, but no matter. You'd be happier here.
Yes, and with a grandmother's unconditional love, Who needs frat boys who only like you for your convertible?
whoa. When did I get a convertible?
well, we were gonna surprise you with one for your birthday,
but since you're keeping the baby, You'll want a more practical gift.
we're thinking a diaper service.
Oh, look, they have water aerobics.
up!
out.
you should sign up.
you know, maybe I should go to college.
I mean, for the boy's sake.
how can support it without a degree?
but you can't raise this child in a Miami dorm room.
you'll need to leave it with someone you can trust to take care of it properly.
sorry. The elevator's outi...
I have to catch my breath.
grandma?
we need to talk.
what's this? - I thought we might toast my victory.
I'm kind of in the middle of something here.
Oh.
So...you haven't congratulated me yet.
I know.
would you like to tell me what's bothering you?
I just want you to think about what you've been doing for the past few days.
you've mounted a crusade against a metal thing that shoots out water.
I'm trying to keep the neighborhood beautiful. I love this street.
Yeah, you keep saying that
how happy you used to be here,
but ever since we've moved back, All I've seen is an unhappy woman who needs to control everything.
when you lose control.
should again
tell you something else we learned there.
when the chips are down, it helps to have friends.
and you certainly haven't made us any lately.
Congratulations.
Bye, grandma. - Good-Bye, dear.
tell your stepfather I'll be right out.
Oh please, Phyllis.
even you have to agree that a girl who'd trade her baby for a convertible isn't ready for motherhood.
she'd have changed once the baby came.
she's her father's daughter.
that's a nice picture of Rex.
Oh, I have a lot of pictures.
all of the women here do.
they're what we have left of the things time has taken from us...
youth, homes and husbands...And for the unluckiest, children.
I thought I was getting back a part of Rex.
but now...
I know you're lonely, Phyllis, But I can't give up this child just to make you feel better.
you should go.
your family's waiting for you.
Orson and I go to our club almost every Saturday night, if you're...Interested in babysitting.
you mean it?
how will you explain me to your friends?
I'll say that you're broke and needed the money.
can't you just say that you like having me around?
I need something that will fly, Phyllis.
Hey. What's going on?
we need to talk.
so here's the deal.
I think it's time for us to do the right thing.
I don't think I like where this is going.
we have to end this affair - you serious? - All this...Sneaking around, wearing disguises, hiding in closets?
it's just wrong.
we're better than this.
so what are you suggesting, we stay with Victor and Edie?
no, we break up with them.
look, it'll hurt, but at least it's honest.
and then when enough time has gone by and they've moved on,
we can be together.
how long are we talking about?
I don't know. Six months?
six months?
nobody takes that long to heal anymore.
it's a breakup, not a face-lift.
Hey, look, I want us to be together, too, but I also wanna myself good about it.
don't you?
Yeah.
I do.
you're such a good guy, Carlos.
I really hate that about you.
I know.
so...I guess this is it.
this kiss has to last six months.
you better make it good.
Hey, Lynette.
Hey, Judas.
okay, fine. You're still angry, but I'm gonna make it up to you.
when they come after that tree house, they're going to have one Susan Mayer chained to it.
don't do that.
I wanna be sad when they knock it down.
Lynette! - What?
you think you can just walk over here and cute your way out of what you did?
we're supposed to be friends.
exactly, and friends don't put friends in this kind of position.
I love you, but you can't ask me to put your kids ahead of my husband.
no, Parker, that guy doesn't have freezing...
you're right. I shouldn't have done that.
but that tree house is the one place my kids can go and not hear about body scans and white blood cell counts.
it is their getaway from this horrible thing that I've brought into the house.
brought?
sweetie, it's not your fault that you're sick.
I know that...here.
but here...it feels like I've ruined their childhood.
okay, if anybody needs me, I'll be at the hardware ore buying chains.
Oh, Jeez. Get over here.
hello there!
Oh, look, it's our new queen... Katherine of arrogant.
Hey, where's the wrecking ball?
actually, I came to tell you the tree house can stay.
Oh, my God. That's great!
Yes.
if anyone complains, we'll say it was grandfathered in under the previous administration.
Wow.
Thanks.
Why?
clearly, it means a lot to you, and I wanna be a good neighbor.
what's with you? Sometimes you act like an ice queen, and then you do something really nice.
you are one complicated lady.
well, I've had one complicated life.
I've had a lot of men in my life, but I never let myself fall in love before.
I thought it was because I didn't wanna get hurt, but...now I know the pain you feel isn't the worst part.
it's the hate.
could you make it out to "cash"?
Hello, Katherine.
you here about the fountain?
Yes, but don't worry. There's no strict deadline. You can...have it removed at your earliest convenience.
Yeah, I don't think it's going anywhere.
Oh, boys, boys, the war's over.
Yes, it is.
we know all about Chicago.
come again?
my ex is on the board of Chicago memorial hospital.
seems your husband made quite a stir there...whole hospital still buzzing about what he did.
whatever you heard is a vicious lie...every word of it.
still, it was enough to...make you leave town, which begs the question, do you like living here?
Oh, good. We're in agreement. The fountain stays.
thanks for stopping by, Katherine.
it's the same for all of us.
we try not to get too close to the people who live next door.
it's easier to give them a polite nod than to ask what's wrong.
it's safer to keep walking by than to get involved...
you right now. Okay, I don't wanna work...
true, we sometimes do get to know the people we share a fence with and end up lifelong friends.
thanks for everything. - Thank you.
but mostly, we keep our distance because we'd rather our neighbors know nothing about us...than know too much.
my name is Oliver Queen.
after five years in hell,
I have come home with only one goal...
to save my city.
now others have joined my crusade.
to them, I am Oliver Queen.
to the rest of Starling City, I am someone else.
I am something else.
there's a lot of good people, they lose someone, they lose themselves, which is why they come in here to work off that rage.
Roy, are you OK?
you look a little tired.
I just haven't been sleeping much lately.
if I had accepted my life, I would be a cocktail waitress in Vegas like my mother, and I never would have believed some crazy guy in a hood when he told me I could be more than just some it girl.
you're not moving very quickly this morning.
I just didn't sleep much last night.
you're not boxing, girl.
you're not even fighting.
you're just lashing out.
come on!
impressive.
how do normal people spend their morning?
four...
five.
Mrs. Fernandes!
I already told you, I haven't seen your...cat.
I haven't seen him, either.
or is the cat a girl?
was I being misogynist just now?
or is it misogynistic? I never know.
Ray...What are you...
nice place you've got here. Lots of space.
so it occurred to me this morning, what's the one thing that Queen Consolidated has that we don't use to its maximum potential?
a doorbell?
have you heard of a process called cogeneration?
I haven't even looked at a cup of coffee yet.
well, cogeneration is...
the repurposing of waste heat given off by electricity production.
exactly. It's a principle of thermodynamic efficiency, which occurred to me could be applied to a building which generates over 240, 000 watts of electricity.
like Queen Consolidated.
I did some preliminary calculations on the drive over.
you want to sell QC's excess energy back to the city?
if by "sell" you mean "give away for free," then yes.
energy is something that should be given freely to the masses.
uh, you still haven't found Mrs. Fernandes' cat, I'm guessing.
Oh, my beautiful girl!
very friendly with your neighbors, I see.
mom...
mom?
what are you doing here?
honey, I came to see you.
for a visit.
look, look, look.
didn't you get my text?
mom, to send a text, you actually have to press "send" on the text.
Oh, OK, not a big deal, I'll do it right now.
are you adopted?
hmm.
Oh! I'm so sorry.
I didn't know you had somebody staying over.
Oh, no, he's not staying over.
he's not, like, we're not...
this is my boss.
it's a pleasure to meet you, Miss Smoak.
Hi. You can call me Donna.
mom...
I'm Ray.
Oh, my god.
you're that watch guy.
we like to call them smart wearables.
I bought one of your watches!
look!
see?
felicity here thinks I don't pay attention to all of her tech things.
Yeah, I see you've got a 3GS.
I'm actually wearing a prototype for the new six.
Yeah, it basically replaces your computer.
very fancy. You know what?
it's yours.
Oh, no. Seriously?
I'll let you two catch up.
let me know what you think about those cogeneration numbers, and Donna, hope to see you again soon.
well, don't count on it.
she'll probably be really busy...
planning my funeral after I die of embarrassment.
you are standing in an open field west of the White House with a boarded front door.
what are you doing?
I just finished coding a Linux emulator for Zork.
it is Pitch Black.
you are likely to be eaten...by a Grue.
I guess you'll have to protect me.
why can't you just quietly have sex under a comforter like most college students?
you found an exploitable note?
now I just need your super computer virus to crack the firewall.
I really wish you wouldn't call my x-axis bi-numeric algorithm a "super-virus."
spoofing the IP, switching to MD6, and...
somebody take a screenshot.
we have to post this to hacker forum, to brag that we actually got in!
hold on.
30 seconds until the firewall goes back up.
Cooper, what are you doing?
I think the world would be a much better place if there weren't any student loans, don't you?
you can't wipe out all the loans, they'll never think it's a glitch.
they're going to track us down and find us!
10 seconds.
I'm not going to jail for you, Cooper, and you shouldn't, either.
I almost had it!
what were you thinking?!
ever heard of hacktivisim?
instead of posting to web forums, we could be doing some real good in the world.
and going to prison in the process.
it's all about what you want to be when you grow up, babe...
a hacker, or a hero?
Hello?
speedy?
just signed the lease.
what do you think?
Thea, you're signing a lease on a spot that you can't possibly afford.
I can, actually.
whose money?
Malcolm Merlyn's.
his estate, I mean.
when I left Starling City, I mentioned something to Ned Foster about Malcolm being my father, and there's a lot of legal stuff I didn't understand, and...
he left you money?
the entire world thinks he's dead.
so, yes, legally, his estate goes to his last living heir.
and, ahem, last week when you told me that you had investors for the club, that was a lie?
I was afraid you wouldn't react well to the idea of me taking his money.
it's blood money, Thea!
you don't know what Malcolm Merlyn is capable of!
I know what his money is capable of...
renting me this really sweet loft.
listen to me.
he's alive, and if you take his money, he has a hold on you.
I think you're being a little melodramatic.
I'm his daughter, OK?
he's not going to put me in danger.
he's responsible for the death of 503 innocent people, including your brother.
now that is a card that you do not get to play.
you are my brother, but that does not mean you have the right to tell me what I can do with my life.
I am my own person.
the movers are coming tomorrow, so you can stop by with popcorn or not stop by at all.
Oh, please.
what is going on?
you OK?
disguised voice: We are Brother Eye.
judgment has been rendered against this city.
its sentence carried out.
an earthquake.
a siege.
this is what comes next...
a new life you will live on your knees, and it will take nothing more than a push of a button.
we are in control now.
and this is just the beginning.
let there be light.
Ooh, a nightclub.
you know, I'm really not dressed for a nightclub.
Really?
you think?
my friend owns the place.
he just needs a little help turning the power back on, so...
why don't you...
come, come. Stay put.
stay here?
right here.
OK. - Mm-hmm.
Hey. Any luck tracking this...
hello.
Hi.
uh, please tell me this is your friend.
no.
mom, this is Oliver... - Queen.
very nice to meet you.
Yes, it's so nice to meet you, too.
how many billionaires do you know?
Diggle, meet Felicity's mom.
mom.
John Diggle. - Hi.
very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too.
Oh! Hello!
who is this little nugget?
this is my daughter Sara.
Ooh! - - Mom. Mom. Ahem, mom!
what?
we have to go downstairs.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to stop you.
I'm so sorry. Little baby moment.
so sorry.
it's great to meet you, finally.
Yes, yes, definitely.
why is Sara here?
Lyla's on on assignment in Santa Prisca and the nanny called in sick.
why not, Oliver, who's she going to tell?
well, she...
I'm not comfortable with her down there.
God help me.
my mother loves babies.
Really?
whoever this Brother Eye group is somehow got access to the city's protected network and uploaded a system-wide virus.
oliver: Any way to trace it?
no, it deleted itself as soon as it completed its task.
they said the power outage was just the beginning.
then let's find them before there's a next time.
Hey, Laurel, are you all right? Did you get here OK?
I'm fine. I was close.
but why do I get the emergency services alert?
why don't they call the district attorney?
cause he's visiting his niece in Coast City.
you are the acting district attorney.
Congratulations.
Hello, Detective...Captain.
look, you're on this Brother Eye thing, right?
we are.
good,'cause there's no one here knows computers better than you.
no, for the last time, I am not interested in buying a fake ID.
I am hanging up now. Bye.
my mom says hi.
you still angry at me?
I was past the firewall and into the account network.
I had 3, 000 debts wiped by the time you pulled the plug on me.
well, think of how many accounts you could go to prison for if I hadn't stopped you.
relax.
the DNS wasn't configured.
they can't backtrace me.
they can.
the subroot was configured.
by accessing the accounts, you set off a packets feedback that anyone could trace back to.
you are gorgeous when you're being a chicken.
come on, I'm serious. - I'm serious.
don't move You are under arrest.
What?!
No! No, No, No!
you're under arrest for violation of U. S.Code title 18, section 1030.
don't!
you have the right to remain silent.
let go of him, let him go!
brother Eye: We said this was just the beginning.
electricity is not the only power in the city.
consider money, for example.
the banks are next to go dark.
your beloved dollars wiped away as your accounts will finally all be equal, at zero.
Felicity... - I'm working on it.
I set up some trace IP packets before Brother Eye's last broadcast.
as soon as he opened up the channel, I scooped up the bread crumbs.
bread crumbs we can follow?
I hope so.
Where's Captain Lance?
coordinating squad car patrols for dispatch.
Why? What's wrong?
there's a situation at Starling National.
send in an ESU squad.
sorry, ma'am, but you don't have the power to...
I'm acting district attorney.
the city charter gives me operational authority in times of crisis, which this clearly is.
I'm not letting anyone get hurt.
send in an ESU now.
what's going on?
SCPD just dispatched a riot squad to Starling National.
it's like fighting a fire with gasoline.
suit up.
this group is ordered to disperse!
back!
back behind the line!
Oliver, the riot is getting out of control.
you need to hurry up.
back!
back behind the line!
get away from the bank!
the teargas is dispersing them, but we can't calm the entire city, Felicity.
the trace led me to the virus they're using.
I'm combing through now.
no, No, No, No, No, No!
what's wrong?
the virus...
I can't stop it!
how do you know?
because it's mine.
I wrote it five years ago.
OK, OK, before you say anything, just know that I never imagined the virus being used for something like this.
I mean, sure, I could have imagined it.
I actually have a very vivid imagination.
like cronuts! I had a vision of them before...
Hey.
relax.
take a deep breath.
good.
now start at the beginning.
I was in this, I guess you could call it a group, in college.
we were "hacktivists."
for lack of a better word.
civil disobedience via the World Wide Web.
I created this.
that could give us root access to any infected server.
we could expose government fraud and start virtual sit-ins and digitally deface criminals.
I guess you could say it was my first attempt at being a hero.
why didn't you tell me about any of this?
do we even know a fraction of what happened to you the five years that you were away?
who else had access to the program?
he was my...
I had a boyfriend in college, and Myron was his roommate.
and he was a member of this hacktivist group?
what about the boyfriend?
Oh, he couldn't have done this.
he's...
not in the picture, but Myron always had somewhat of an edge.
can you get me an address?
sure.
just one small problem...
not small, necessarily, but short.
just take the alleyway entrance.
are you OK?
I've been better.
I talked it over with Myron, and I'm going to tell them I wrote the super virus.
you can't do that.
I can't let you rot in prison, Coop.
you can't tell them you wrote that virus...
cause I already told them I did.
I always said I'd protect you from the grues.
this isn't... - It's better this way.
I wiped out those loans.
there's no reason both of us should be in prison.
I love you.
love you, too.
Hey. Got a minute?
congratulations, you called in a riot squad, you nearly started one!
and! You did it behind my back.
you were busy, and the situation at Starling National was escalating.
you escalated it, Laurel!
please tell me you can at least see that now.
OK.
I'm sorry.
Laurel, baby...
what's gotten into you?
you're angry, you're distant, you're reckless.
tell me you're not boozing again.
no.
then what the hell's going on?
because this isn't you.
look, I haven't said anything because I was hoping that you would say something,
I can't talk about it with you.
OK.
but listen, you don't have to talk about it with me.
but talk about it with somebody.
cause secrets hurt, baby.
sometimes more than the truth.
back-up generator keeps that locked. Or...
so they told me.
I could never get that stupid door to open.
contractor says the entire sub level is flooded, though.
it was a water main break.
what are you doing here, Ollie?
a super hacker is trying to take over the city and I'm worried about you.
I still get to be worried, right?
Yes.
and if you really have to, you can even be judgmental...
occasionally.
someone told me recently that a family is pretty precious.
and love, in spite of everything, is what makes it precious.
right now, the Queen family is just you and me.
so let it just be you and me.
and don't take Merlyn's money.
I'm trying to meet you halfway here, Ollie.
the other half is up to you.
you have failed this city.
tell him he has to retract all the infected packets from subsystem mainframes within the city.
tell me how to shut down the virus.
do it now.
you think I'm behind the cyber attacks?
sounds like a Brother Eye to me.
I swear to god, I'm not.
I head up the IT department of an accounting firm.
I drive a hybrid. It's blue.
I'm one of the sheep lunatics like these guys hate.
why would I do this?
digital fingerprints are all over this code.
there's an x-axis bionumeric algorithm.
the code's an x-axis bionumeric algorithm that you've used before!
in college.
my roommate and his girlfriend.
Yeah, yeah, sure, we developed it.
we called it a super virus, but that doesn't mean I'm the eye guy!
have you tried Felicity Smoak?
she's innocent.
then it's got to be someone else.
after we graduated, I might have showed the code off to a few people.
who were they?! - I don't remember.
it was five years ago.
I didn't think it was a big deal.
we were just kids playing with matches.
I am running out of expletives!
we need to track down whoever Myron shared your code with.
I hacked all of his emails and all his text messages from five years ago and all I got was depressed.
OK. What about your ex?
I already told you, he didn't do it.
Why?
because he's your ex-boyfriend?
because...
my senior year of college, Cooper and I did a stupid thing.
he got arrested and he went to prison.
so he went to prison.
maybe he got out.
he didn't.
how do you know?
because he's dead.
he hung himself before sentencing.
Felicity, I...
I just really need to be alone right now.
Ah. I'm glad you're here.
when I launched my plan to rebrand Starling into Star City,
I didn't count on cyber terrorism.
I'm looking for a partner with whom to drown my sorrows and you definitely look like someone who could use a drink.
I'm sorry.
my mother...
I didn't have anywhere else to go.
you OK?
you're an inventor.
did you ever create anything that you didn't think was important, turns out, it's very important?
of course.
those turn out to be the best inventions.
not always.
you want to talk about it?
of course I'd find you here.
could you just wait one second? - Wait?
I'm sorry; I've already waited two hours for you at your apartment, and before that, it was two hours in the club.
is there any way that you could be anywhere else but here?
Thanks, Mom.
that wasn't the least bit mortifying.
only half as bad as parents' week in freshman year.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I've been reduced to stalking my own daughter.
because you can't seem to comprehend that I can't make the whole world stop because you decided to show up on my doorstep.
I have responsibilities!
Yes, I know, Felicity.
you have work.
you have work, work, work, work.
no, No, No,you don't understand.
it is so much more than work.
but all you care about it my love life or how much cleavage I don't show.
that is not true!
that is completely true!
and I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I'm terminally single.
I'm sorry I have an actual job.
I'm sorry that I don't dress like a porn star!
which I realize is a compliment to you.
so I'm so sorry that I am such a disappointment to you!
I'm not as smart as you, Felicity, or your father.
I know that.
even when you were only six years old, I could barely keep up with you two.
and...
maybe I wasn't always the mother you wanted, but I was always there.
I stayed and I tried.
he...
he left me.
he left us.
but when I look at you, all I see is what he gave you.
there is nothing of me...
in you.
you know, it's so funny. I was...
I was always so afraid that one day, you were going to leave me, too.
but now I finally realize...
you already did.
there are people on the other end of this thing, right?
people we can hit?
we need Felicity.
I'm here.
the super virus has 3, 407 traceable access notes.
hopefully I didn't put a firewall in every one, though.
of course I did, because I'm smarter than that.
seriously, if I had two less IQ points, we never would have gotten in this mess.
are you all right?
Where's your mom? - I don't know.
probably back at my place, wishing she had a different daughter.
it's a long story.
so go see her. Take an hour.
the city is under attack.
you're our best chance of stopping it, but not like this, Felicity.
your head's not in the game.
I will get it together.
your tracer hack's running.
take an hour.
go talk to your mom.
I do not have anything to say to her.
you know, earlier today,
Thea told me that she literally has to put up with me because family is precious.
and that it's love, in spite of everything, that makes it precious.
go.
Where's Sara?
the nanny came to pick her up.
said he was from a company called A. R.G. U.S.
I don't know, I've never heard of it.
I think that's the point.
well, I'm glad you're still here.
you are a terrible liar, Felicity.
might be the only thing we have in common.
I have blonde hair.
you dye it.
you're right.
we're different, and it's always going to be that way.
and it's not easy...
no, you know what, it's...
it's totally my fault for just showing up here uninvited.
seriously. I think I just got so excited about this free flight.
what?
my plane ticket.
I got an email that said I'd won some contest.
free first class round trip to Starling.
email?
mom.
someone wanted you to be here.
mom!
baby! - Mom!
are you OK? - I'm OK.
Oh! Oh, thank god!
where are we?
felicity Smoak, just the woman I wanted to see.
what the hell do you want from me?!
who are you?
you really don't know?
I thought you'd never forget your first love.
you died.
they told me...
that I committed suicide, right?
the NSA needed a hacker with game for cyber espionage, and I needed to not be in prison for the rest of my life.
because of what the NSA wanted me doing, it was...
advantageous for me to be dead.
when I found out you died, I was devastated.
I loved you.
I loved you, too.
after I finished my time with the NSA, I was going to find you.
to let you in on this.
and then I discovered you'd become this corporate lap dog.
broke my heart.
you changed.
if you ever thought I was capable of doing something like this, you never really knew me at all.
when you wrote this virus, Felicity, you knew exactly what it was capable of.
all I'm doing is unleashing the true potential of what you made.
Why?!
this isn't who you are!
five years with the NSA, you learn a lot about how the world works.
how we can't be saved or salvaged.
how it's every man for himself.
you also learn that when a city bank goes under, say, financial cyber attack, the mayor will reach out to the Treasury Department and request an influx of fresh cash.
cash which is transported by armored trucks navigating according to a closed-end GPS system, which directs them to City Deposit.
if the drivers deviate from the route, the trucks are shut down.
but you're going to hack into the system and direct the cash to come here.
it was about money, and I'm the sell-out?
no. No, babe.
you're the one who's going to help me.
see, breaking into the treasury's asymmetric encryption is beyond even my capabilities.
I'm going to politely decline.
don't!
that's why I flew some motivation into town for you.
she's been MIA for over an hour.
well, you did tell her to go home.
I just had an A. R.G. U.S. agent pick up Sara there.
I could have them go back, check things out.
Yep.
OK.
Felicity's never more than five feet from her phone.
something's wrong.
No! No!
that terminal's configured to only connect with the Treasury's IP.
I mention this so you don't try to do anything stupid, like alert the police.
I'm so sorry.
mom...
right now's not really the best time, OK?
but it might be the last time, hon, and I want you to know that all I've ever wanted...
is for you to be happy.
let's say we hit pause on the Dr. Phil episode.
it's done!
it's done.
that quick?
there's a reason you wanted me, right?
they'll be at your front door in five minutes.
guards will be armed.
stay put, OK?
just because we used to screw doesn't mean I won't use this gun.
what's that?
huh?
Oh, that, that's the watch.
it's the watch Mr. Palmer gave me.
it chimes on the hour, and I guess when we're about to be killed.
we're not going to be killed.
we're going to get out of here.
it basically replaces your computer.
you know I don't know what that means.
it means it has Wifi.
Really?
when they're in range...
you know what to do.
I did what you wanted.
you don't have to kill us.
Really?
who would have thought that I'd become the grue?
Hey! Hey.
you want to wave that gun at me, fine, but don't you dare threaten my daughter.
here I thought you were all nails and hair.
try single mom who's worked 60 hour weeks in six inch heels for tips in order to raise that genius child you see right there.
I may not understand all this cyber whatever, but I know without that gun, you wouldn't last 10 seconds against my girl.
too bad she doesn't have 10 seconds.
oliver: I disagree!
put the gun down.
you were always good, Felicity.
so good.
but so am I.
cooper: Motion sensored.
they can hit most any target.
something's wrong.
clear.
this is all your fault.
mom! Mom, are you OK?
are you OK?
before, you were right to keep pressing on Cooper.
turns out he's not as dead as I thought.
I've had some experience with that.
and you learn not to judge.
Yes.
are you OK?
I guess so.
old lovers have a way of opening old wounds.
lovers...
sounds creepy no matter how you say it.
I want you to know that whatever experiences you had to go through,
I'm glad that you did.
they shaped the person you are today.
and you know how I feel about her.
I should head out.
you were right.
we have to love our families.
no matter what.
you here?
what happened to you?
this is me now.
you were right.
something is going on with me.
and my father, he...
he noticed it as well.
he told me I should open up to someone.
my sister, she...
she died.
well, she...
she was murdered.
did they ever catch the...
no. No one knows that she's gone except for me.
and I can't tell anyone.
so, yes.
Yes, I am angry.
I'm going to help you with that.
see, before, Laurel, you were swinging at your sister's killer.
that's a target you're never going to hit.
don't train for that.
all right, train for yourself.
see, now I know how to teach you.
so what's it going to be?
red or black?
black.
definitely black.
it was popcorn, right?
you said you were meeting me halfway.
this is me doing my part.
I missed you, Speedy.
let's not miss each other anymore.
I mean, it was so much easier to be in each other's lives when we were underneath the same roof.
So...Why don't you move in with me?
I mean, clearly I have enough space.
and I...
I swear once the club starts making a profit,
I will donate all of Malcolm's money to an earthquake relief charity thing.
I can live with that.
you got a TV in here?
well, I'm officially off.
I mean, my flight doesn't leave till tonight, but I figured you'd be working, so we can...
we can just say good-bye now.
you were right.
about what?
I haven't always been appreciative of you.
you were always there for me every day, and night.
so if I haven't said thank you enough, thank you.
but you were wrong, too.
Mm-hmm?
when you said all you saw in me was dad; there was nothing of you in me.
well, I can't really explain it, but over the past two years,
I have been through a lot.
and I have learned that I am a lot tougher than I thought.
that...
I get from you.
don't cry.
so I took another look at those cogeneration numbers.
you want to...
Oh.
hi again.
Hi.
how's that new smart wearable working out for you?
Oh, it's, um, it's a real life saver.
Yeah.
ray, I can't come into work today.
I am...
calling in sick.
feel better.
thank you.
see you later.
that's actually pretty genius.
Hello, Sara.
what are you doing here?
I need Karen Hayes to go away.
I understand, sir.
I need the president to sign off on my proposals.
she's gone from being an irritant to an obstacle.
I want to talk about your husband's incompetence, and your covering it up.
I did nothing illegal or incorrect.
your resignation within the hour.
Mr. President, I am tendering my resignation.
is there anything I can do to change your mind?
no, sir, there is not.
walid has earned their trust.
these men know something about the bombs that we don'T.
I don't think these guys you're tracking are connected to anyone.
they're not terrorists.
I'm getting Walid the hell out of there.
you spied on us?
you're worse than they are!
son of a bitch!
a nuclear bomb just went off, like, 25 miles from here.
when I'm done with this deal,
I may just buy you a small country.
have you found an engineer?
I told you I'd find someone and I will.
it's just taking longer.
start talking, Gray!
I made a mess.
dad's trying to clean it up.
what happened?
I hired Mccarthy to oversee the job, but...
so the nukes that these terrorist are in possession of, including the one that was just detonated in Valencia, was supplied by Mccarthy and stolen from you.
Yes.
I'm heading to Mccarthy's office in Simi valley.
we have teams standing by.
let me know.
stop.
he's my son.
what are you doing here, jack?
Jack: I know what you're trying to cover up, dad.
gray already told me.
McCarthy's not here.
Hey, what are you doing?
put the gun down!
you work for me.
no, dad, he doesn'T.
you don't think I'd let you run loose without keeping an eye on you, do you?
this is insane.
I am at the edge of the safe zone.
behind me is the nuclear blast.
emergency medical teams are being overwhelmed by the number of injured.
in what president Palmer has confirmed was a tactical nuclear weapon detonated just a little over two hours ago in this Valencia neighborhood north of Los Angeles, more than 12, 000 people are estimated to have perished in the blast.
LAPD is spread thin, but on an encouraging note, we've heard that they are receiving a flood...
I just heard about Karen's resignation.
I'm sorry for the loss.
are you really sorry, Tom?
because your words seemed somewhat hollow to me.
it's no secret Karen and I butted heads the last few weeks.
nevertheless, I respected her as an adversary.
she never gave me a concrete reason why she resigned, but there was something...
something she wasn't telling me.
this may have something to do with it.
this is a draft of the executive order I presented this morning.
Karen found out I was going to resubmit it to you for your authorization.
and so she quit?
that makes absolutely no sense to me, Tom.
she's never been afraid of a fight.
maybe she finally realized her arguments are invalid and that this is the only possible response to the danger we're facing.
you want to tell me why I would sign off on something that I rejected six hours ago?
because, sir, six hours ago, we didn't know Fayed had nukes.
even so, Tom, you're talking about suspending habeas corpus, extending the length and broadening the criteria for those detention centers.
those actions will constitute a brazen abuse of executive power.
those actions will degrade Fayed's network, limiting his ability to make use of these remaining nuclear weapons.
sir, Fayed's sole intention here is the destruction of our country, its infrastructure, social order, entire way of life, and he's got the will and means to make good on that threat.
Tom, have you stopped to think about the fact I would be forcing the people who elected me to give up the rights and freedoms that define the essence of this country?
sir, if one more nuke goes off, it would have been Fayed who's redefined our country.
pass this out to the cabinet.
we'll convene in 30 minutes.
you're doing the right thing, Mr. President.
call the cabinet in for an emergency session.
tell general White we're ramping up.
does that mean the president is signing off on this?
he wouldn't convene the cabinet unless he was.
good work, Reed.
well, I'm just doing what needs to be done, sir.
getting rid of Karen is distinctly unpleasant, but she left us no choice.
girl, I'm sorry I'm late with the briefing.
tell the president we're still tracking Fayed through Mccarthy.
bill, I've just had to resign.
resign? What are you talking about?
can't get into it right now, but I've asked to be reassigned to cut as an on-site liaison.
Karen, you can't leave the president today, of all days.
bill, do you think that I would do this if I had any other choice?
Lennox has something to do with this, doesn't he?
I cannot talk about this right now.
I will see you in a few hours. Okay?
Mr. Buchanan.
what is it, Chloe?
I've been trying to reach Jack on his cell phone;
he's not answering.
try his backup teams.
I tried; they're not answering either.
maybe he had them all go dark.
he wouldn't do that without telling us first.
send in the support units, see if they can get a visual.
all right.
and keep trying Jack.
so after we're done, where do you want us to meet you?
I'll be here another hour dumping hard drives.
we'll meet you back at the house, then.
just make sure it goes exactly according to plan.
don't worry.
it's my job to worry.
it was all for you, Jack.
everything I worked for, everything I built
it was all for you.
after you left, I tried to convince myself that Graem was capable of heading the family...
protecting the company
I guess, on some level, I always knew the truth about him.
I just wasn't willing to admit it to myself.
I don't know what you want me to say.
I want you to understand that after you left, Graem was all I had.
I pushed you away, didn't I?
I'm really sorry.
get out.
come on.
don't do this, sir.
whatever Graem's paying you, I'll double it.
just keep it moving.
get down on your knees, both of you.
no.
you son of a bitch.
at least have the guts to look me in the eye.
I needed to question him.
they were gonna kill us, Jack.
search his pockets for the keys.
damn it!
bill, it's Jack.
Jack, we haven't been able to reach you.
are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine, but all the members of the backup team have been killed.
have you found Mccarthy?
not yet, but I know how to get to hiM.
how?
my brother.
you said your brother wasn't involved when Mccarthy brokered the nukes.
he lied to mE.
he didn't tell us everything.
based on what?
he just tried to have me and my father killed.
bill, I need you to set up a perimeter around his house.
I'll send a field team right away.
have them do an immediate recon, confirm that he's there.
I want Burke standing by with an interrogation kit.
what?
as it stands now, Mccarthy is our only lead to Fayed.
we need to find Fayed before he arms the nukes.
I'll get back to you as soon as I make contact with the field team.
we need to go.
where do you think you're going?
I'm hungry.
there's a candy machine in the lobby.
don't worry. We'll be leaving soon.
you said that an our ago.
sit down, Rita.
yes?
good news.
I found someone to program the trigger codes for your bombs.
who?
I've just you sent his profile, employment record, education, the whole curriculum vitae.
you should have it on your screen.
I'm looking at it now.
he seems qualified.
Oh, he'll get the job done, but he won't work willingly.
he'll need to be coerced.
okay, when will you have him?
within the hour.
call me when you do.
Mr. Buchanan, you need to listen to this.
what?
NSA intercepted a stream of chatter
part of it's an audio recording.
they've identified one of the voices as belonging to Fayed.
let's hear it.
good news.
I found someone to program the trigger codes on your bombs.
who?
I've just sent you his profile, employment record, education, the whole curriculum vitae.
it should be on your screen.
I'm looking at it now.
he seems qualified.
he'll get the job done, but he won't work willingly.
he'll need to be coerced.
okay, when will you have him?
within the hour.
call me when you do.
second voice matches the sample we pulled off Mccarthy's voice-mail.
they lost Numair in the explosion, so Mccarthy found someone else to arm the nukes.
send the file to audio forensics.
have them scan for any background artifacts that could give us a location.
Yes, sir.
I had Morris working on something, too.
we also found an image file inside the data stream.
NSA thinks it might be a photo of the engineer.
is this it?
Yeah, it got all corrupted during the intercept.
I'm writing a salvage utility.
I should have a new code in a second.
getting an image of the engineer may be our only way of stopping those nukes.
give me an estimate.
well, that's hard to say.
could be ten minutes, it could be an hour.
who's the agent in charge?
my name is Jack Bauer.
Mr. Bauer, I'm Hal Turner.
I'll be on point.
are your men in position?
Yes, sir.
we've sealed off a one-block radius, and our recon has confirmed your brother's inside
his wife and son are in there as well.
I want you to inform your team to use nonlethal force.
we need to take my brother alive.
understood.
let me go in with you.
no.
you wait here.
I need to question Graem alone.
what are you gonna do to him?
whatever it takes to find out what he knows.
I'm not stupid, Graem
I know something is wrong.
everything's fine, Marilyn.
you're a lousy liar.
you always have been.
you know, if you insist on being here, why don't you make some coffee?
why don't you make your own coffee!
will you two stop fighting?
that's all you guys ever do is fight.
I'm sorry, honey.
we're just all a little tense today.
what's going on?
nothing.
nothing. Why don't, why don't we leave your father alone.
he needs to work.
put the weapon down!
drop the gun!
what the hell is this, Jack?!
put it down!
do it.
get on the floor!
take it easy, Jack!
I want you take him into the next room, have Burke prep him for questioning.
I want every hard drive, every memory stick in this house uploaded and sent over to CTU.
pick him up.
go. Go.
what are you doing to my dad?
Josh, I'll explain as soon as I can, but right now I need to speak to your mother.
please, just take a seat.
please, son, come on.
let's go.
let go of me!
stop looking at me like this has something to do with us, because it doesn'T.
Graem just tried to have me and our father killed.
Why?
why would he try and kill you?
they nuclear bomb that was detonated earlier today
the terrorists acquired it from the family's company!
gray's been trying to cover it up.
I'm sorry, Marilyn.
I understand how difficult this must be for you to believe.
it's not.
I may not know the details of what he's done, but I know what he's capable of.
there are four more other bombs out there.
we need to get them back
is there anything that you can tell me?
like what?
did gray talk about a man named Mccarthy?
no.
are you sure?
he hasn't confided in me in years.
he probably never did.
Marilyn, thousands of lives are at stake.
please, just think.
I wish I knew something, I really wish I did, but I don't know anything.
and Josh doesn't know anything, either, and he doesn't need to know.
I'll do everything I can to protect him.
No!
I've seen what happens when you try and protect people.
I just want to get my son, and I want to get out of here!
sir, we found two computers, both linked to one network.
he was trying to erase files
we're sending what's left over to CTU.
okay, good.
my sister-in-law and my nephew don't need to stay here.
have them transported back to CTU.
they can be debriefed there.
Yes, sir.
Mrs. Bauer.
we're taking you and your son back to CTU.
grandpa.
you okay?
not really.
wait in the car, baby.
Jack told me what Graem did, what he was involved with.
is it true?
it's complicated.
but it's true.
you make sure he keeps Josh out of this.
I panicked, Jack.
that's all there is to it.
you panicked?
that's your excuse?
you panicked?!
you tried to kill me and our father.
I was backed into a corner.
I was just protecting my ass.
you knew about a tactical nuclear weapon on American soil.
you are responsible for the death of thousands and thousands of people.
you think I really wanted that bomb to go off, Jack?
I think you knew more about Mccarthy than you told me.
how do I find him?
I don't have a clue.
how do I find him?!
I just told you I don't know.
there are four more bombs out there.
this isn't a joke, Gray.
tell me now, how do I find Mccarthy?
I told you everything I know, Jack.
respiration and temperature patterns indicate deception, especially his last reply.
set up the interrogation package.
you don't want to make me do this, Gray.
we grew up together, Jack.
in all those years, I could never make you do anything you didn't want to do.
I need to talk to you.
what is it?
over here.
it's Morris's brother.
he's on his way to horizon regional hospital.
on-site paramedics confirmed he has severe radiation exposure.
it says he's in critical condition.
I'll tell him.
wait, Chloe.
I think we should hold off.
Why?
Morris is the best hope we have for restoring that file.
if we drop this on him now, he might completely shut down.
it's his brother-- we can't keep it a secret.
I understand.
this might sound insensitive, but for a second, put aside your personal feelings for Morris and consider what's at stake.
we need him to finish writing that salvage utility.
I know Morris; he can handle it.
I hope so.
Yes, darling?
I have some bad news.
it's about Timothy
he's been taken to the hospital.
I'm sorry.
well, this can't be right
it says he was pulled...
from his car by rescue workers just north of Valencia.
operator.
Yes, could you connect me with horizon regional hospital, please?
what was he doing in Valencia?
I'm sorry, sir, all circuits are busy.
Yes, I realize that the lines are busy
this is CTU, Los Angeles, calling
I need an emergency breakthrough.
I cannot help you at this time, sir. - I know...
sorry.
I-I have to go out there.
Morris, hey,
I know it's hard, okay?
but we are in the middle of a crisis.
we need to find the engineer before Fayed does.
you can't just leave.
you can't expect me to sit there when my little brother is dying in the hospital.
I'm sorry, Milo.
listen.
12, 000 people are dead.
if Fayed finds an engineer, it'll be many, many more.
four bombs is about a million people.
think about this.
you can finish writing the program
you can do it.
Yes, I can-- but you started already.
it will take me half an hour to figure out what you've done.
you need to stay here and do your job.
please.
okay.
Thanks.
bill, it's Jack.
did Chloe pull anything off the hard drives?
no, she came up empty.
but 15 minutes ago, the NSA picked up a conversation between Mccarthy and Fayed.
McCarthy's found another engineer to arm the four remaining nukes.
he's delivering the engineer within the hour.
the nukes could be operational within 45 minutes?
that's right.
I'll get back to you.
CTU just confirmed that Mccarthy is looking for an engineer for Fayed.
they're gonna arm the nukes.
then you're wasting time talking to me, Jack.
you're holding something back.
that machine doesn't lie.
then it must be broken because I've told you everything I know.
that's hyocine-pentothal.
it's a neuro-inflamatory, designed to induce pain.
all you have to do to stop me from using it is tell me how to find Mccarthy.
your guess is as good as mine.
come on, come on.
I can take this to seven cc'S.
you will experience pain I can't even describe.
at eight cc's, I run the risk of inducing a heart attack.
make no mistake about it, I will go there if I have to.
please, just tell me what I need to know.
please.
I don't want to hurt you.
you sure about that, Jack?
please, Gray, just tell me what I need to know.
how do I find Mccarthy?!
do it.
breathe.
just breathe.
just breathe.
please...
just tell me what I need to know.
how do I find Mccarthy?!
damn you.
that's eight cc's total, Jack.
his vitals are spiking across the line.
four cc's!
Jack, don'T.
the machine knows you're lying!
I know you're lying!
tell me the truth!
it has nothing to do with Mccarthy.
it has to do with Palmer.
I gave the order for his assassination.
and agent Tony Almeida...
and agent Michelle Dessler
your co-workers
they're all dead because of me.
I arranged everything.
I set the timetable,
I paid off the killers,
I even lured you out of hiding to take the fall.
today wasn't the first time I tried to have you killed, Jack.
Why?
because I love my country!
and in the real world, sometimes that means you have to do things, terrible things...
even unforgivable things, for the sake of your country.
but you know all about that, don't you, brother?
we're the same.
I mean, look at me.
we're the same!
we are not the same!
you want me to kill you?!
do it!
I'm gonna do it my way!
four more cc'S.
I can't do that.
pick up the syringe!
do it!
now!
son of a bitch!
-Get me somebody in here now.
you want to die?
drop your weapon!
drop it!
you're gonna die.
shut down the iv.
shut it down.
I'm here, baby.
I'm ashamed.
what do you mean you're ashamed?
for spying on those men.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
I was wrong.
you did the only thing that you could do...
okay, and that was the right thing.
you're the bravest, most principled man I've ever known.
you get some rest, okay?
Hello?
it's Wayne.
I just heard what happened to Walid.
I am so sorry.
is he going to be all right?
Yeah, I think so.
what they told me is confusing.
they said Walid was working undercover to expose some plot.
there was no plot.
the men weren't part of any conspiracy.
they were just bystanders.
they tell me these men had information about the nuclear weapons.
one of the men pulled it from the internet and showed it to his friends.
Sandra, they should've reported that.
they were afraid they were going to get into more trouble than they're already in.
most of these men were pulled from their jobs and their homes on trumped-up immigration charges.
and now they're facing deportation.
Wayne, you are detaining without due process the people whose help you need the most.
how do you expect for them to help if they don't have any legal protection?
I'm scared.
I know.
everything's gonna be all right.
what's the status?
program's finished.
I just ran it, but this is all we got.
I still don't have a clear image.
what are you doing?
I'm downloading an unlicensed application from a hacker's site.
it might kick-start things.
or it could corrupt the file.
I know these guys.
they write really good code when they're not serving time.
unbelievable.
that's what Graem was holding back?
not only was he responsible for David Palmer's assassination, but he directed the entire conspiracy.
he was trying to protect the company.
that's what he's trying to do now.
incredible.
I wish it got us closer to the nukes, but it doesn'T.
he doesn't know where Mccarthy is.
were you able to pick up anything on NSA chatter?
we think it may contain an image of Mccarthy's engineer.
how long till you know for sure?
can't say. The file's badly corrupted.
Morris is working on it now.
as soon as my brother's ready for transport,
I want him sent back to CTU for further debriefing.
I've redirected a chopper to Jackson middle school, four miles west of your position.
Thanks, Bill.
dad, Graem made his own choices after you let him start running the company.
you can't make yourself responsible for that.
that's not fair.
I'll tell you what isn't fair.
you deserved a better family, Jack.
not this.
not us.
I can just imagine what you must be feeling.
all that time we lost...
what I wouldn't give to have some of it back.
me, too.
agent Bauer.
Yeah.
your brother's been stabilized.
he'll be ready to move in ten minutes.
thank you.
dad, I want you to go back to CTU.
okay.
I need a few minutes.
of coursE.
they're sending a chopper for me.
I have to go.
there.
what?
the plug-in's working.
how long's it going to take?
it's restoring.
you'll have a photo of the engineer in two minutes.
just don't touch anything.
now I have got to go and find out what's happening with my brother.
save it, Milo.
thanks for trying to help.
I'm leaving.
watch my station, okay?
be careful.
call me when you find anything out about Timothy.
I will.
congratulations, Tom.
it's an excellent plan.
well, thank you very much, Mr. Vice president.
it's about time someone in this administration stood up to these people.
to be honest,
I didn't think this president had the stomach for the cure.
I think we're about ready for kickoff here, sir.
I'm going to put you on speakerphone.
is the vice president with us?
I'm on the plane, sir.
I'm assuming everyone here has read executive order 1066?
Tom first proposed his plan to me very early this morning, and I rejected it.
sacrificing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the constitution seemed like, like too steep a price, even for the promise of securitY.
but then Fayed murdered 12, 000 innocent Americans with a nuclear weapon.
I felt compelled to revisit my earlier position.
after careful reconsideration,
I remain convinced that my initial response was in fact the right one.
that implementing this plan
would be a terrible mistake.
I cannot and I will not endorse these actions.
some of you actually seem to feel that the constitution is somehow valid only during times of peace, but not during wartime.
that is not what the founders intended.
with your indulgence, sir, George Washington's enemies wore bright red coats and marched in a straight line.
the founders could have never conceived of a stateless enemy, hiding among us, that targets not our soldiers, but our civilization.
your plan would only hinder the efforts of law enforcement to stop Fayed.
how does my plan hinder law enforcement, sir?
by marginalizing and thereby radicalizing the very people whose help they need to enlist.
the American muslim community is our best line of defense against these terrorists.
but we Americans need to demonstrate that we are governed by the rule of law and never, never by the politics of fear.
Mr. President.
Yes, Noah?
before you make any unilateral decisions, maybe you should hear some other people's thoughts.
I'm sorry, Noah.
the discussion on this matter...
is over.
this better work.
Jack's on his way back to CTU.
I want holding "a" and "b" prepped for interrogation and put together a clearance package for him, no restrictions.
Yes, sir.
we have it yet?
it's gonna be a few more seconds.
as soon as we I.D.The engineer,
I want it posted on the interagency subnet.
we need all eyes possible on this.
Yes, sir.
Oh, my god!
it's Morris!
it's his CV, personal history, everything.
where is he?
on his way to horizon regional hospital.
we got to call that.
his brother was hurt in the blast.
he just left.
security.
this is Bill Bhanan.
has Morris O'brian left the parking lot?
he just drove out, sir.
damn it!
Milo, contact lapd.
put an apb out on his car.
Chloe, see if you can raise him on his cell phone.
Jack, we just id'ed the engineer.
it's Morris O'brian.
Yes.
the file we intercepted was Morris's photo and CV.
McCarthy was sending it to Fayed.
there is no doubt Morris is the engineer.
fine. Put him under a protective watch.
we can'T.
he's gone.
he got a call claiming his brother was in the hospital.
he just left.
we're trying to raise him on his cell.
Morris, hold on.
he's on line one.
we got him, Jack.
patch me through.
Morris, it's Bill Buchanan.
we're on the line with Jack Bauer.
where are you?
I'm on my way to the hospital.
you need to come back to CTU immediately.
I can't do that.
Morris, this is Jack.
listen to me.
there is nothing wrong with your brother.
it's a setup.
the engineer Mccarthy's looking for, it's you.
me?
it was your photo Mccarthy was sending to Fayed.
Morris, you need to turn the car around now.
okay, okay.
get out of the car or the next one's in your head!
what the bloody hell do you want?
don't talk, move!
come on. Let's go.
Jack, they got him!
it sounds like they're transferring him to another vehicle.
Chloe, bring up a satellite feed five-mile radius of CTU.
hurry.
drive.
yes?
we're on our way.
how soon can you be here?
15 minutes.
we'll be waiting.
with my money.
you'll get paid as soon as I have what I want.
let me be clear.
I'm just delivering him.
you'll have to make him cooperate.
he'll cooperate.
agent Burke,
I'd like to speak to my son.
all right.
five minutes.
Thanks.
how am I doing?
you're doing great.
everyone thinks Jack is so tough.
maybe he is...
but so am I.
it's nice to know that I can take anything he can dish out.
you told him about Palmer.
I had to give him something to make him think I cracked, but I kept you out of it.
it's gonna get a lot worse.
he's not finished.
he knows you didn't tell him everything.
and I won'T. You know I won't, dad.
they're going to take you to CTU.
they'll do things there that'll make this seem like a cakewalk.
well, like I said,
I can take it.
I'd like to believe that.
the problem is, I have to be sure.
well, you can be.
I'll hold my mud, dad.
everything's going exactly according to plan.
Jack bought the ruse.
Oh, I know.
I'm sure we convinced him that you were going to have me killed as well.
Yeah, that makes me the bad guy and you the good guy.
I take the rap, do some time, you skate free.
get me out when you can.
meanwhile, the company lives on.
dad, stick to the plan.
that's what you've always said, right?
make a plan.
stick to it.
sometimes you have to make adjustments.
I would never betray you, dad.
I love you.
I love you, too, Graem.
you've been a good boy.
done everything I asked.
only this time, I asked too much.
sorry.
dad...
my son's had a seizure!
get in here now!
hurry up!
what happened?
is he going to make it?
I don't know. Please, give us the room so we can work.
get CTU medical now!
my god, if you people killed my son, I swear...
you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Victor?
Victor, I need your help with something.
honey, I got water boiling.
dinner can wait.
want to help me out of this?
Whoo.
you get it hard on an old man, don't you?
I do, don't I?
Ugh.
how did I get so lucky?
you didn't.
I'm using you for sex.
I love you, Clara.
I love you more.
I'll be back in an hour.
where are you off to?
strawberries.
champagne.
don't you leave this bed.
uh.
Oh, my God, Leo.
what am I going to do?
did you kill your husband?!
no, I did not. I loved my husband.
if you're acquitted, you'll be a billionaire.
how does that make me feel?
my client has no comment.
what's it like sleeping alone now?
by the way, how was the sex?
get her inside.
what station are you from?
where are your credentials?
this is a public street in a free country.
I don't need credentials.
you're no journalist.
someone told you to ask those questions.
look. I'm just doing my job.
I think I can guess who for.
so, what are you getting off Mrs. Musso?
well, it's more sadness than guilt really.
well, the evidence is rock solid.
there's a partial print on a syringe containing cyanide.
there's no sign of forced entry in her apartment.
and she is the primary beneficiary of the will.
well, you got all that going for you, Crosby.
I mean, what do you need me for?
never underestimate the value of an expert witness.
doc, you wanna do this?
hello.
how was the sex?
Oh, hello, Zoe. Well it's been a long time.
what do you need? You need a reference?
I haven't had any trouble getting offers so far.
you sent one of your minions to ask vicious and personal questions to my client.
just so you could read her reactions on TV.
I can't hear you. No, can you say that again.
hear me now?
Oh.
clear as a bell.
counselor. - Counselor.
I'd like to speak with my ex-husband in private, if that's all right.
Absolutely.
I'd like an answer by the end of the business day, if you don't mind.
otherwise, I gotta go to Rayder Firm, and I don't really want to do that.
so, end of the day?
fair enough.
let me guess.
he wants you to be his expert witness?
Yep. Your client is hiding something, Zoe.
probably of a sexual nature, granted that is wishful thinking on my part.
but, you see how she's bringing that hand up to her face?
she's got a secret.
I will tear you apart on the stand, Cal. And you know it.
nice charm, that is.
so, you really think she didn't kill her husband?
Yes, I do.
what makes you so sure?
all the evidence is circumstantial.
and as for motive, there is none.
my client didn't want for anything.
it was a loving and faithful marriage.
she got an alibi?
uh.
how much is she paying you?
exactly what I'm worth.
well, drinks are on you then.
still... no alibi.
well, the trauma of finding her husband dead caused Clara to lose her memory for the 40 minutes between the last time she saw him alive and when she discovered his body.
look at it. I mean, really.
she is pushing those tears out, she is.
I mean, she's faking it.
we both know that this "science" of yours has a serious margin for error.
and it just won't cut it in a court of law.
and what will?
tears for a dead husband that left her $1. 2 billion?
I know why you're doing this.
and you're not going to get under my skin.
or my skirt.
you know that's a lie, that is.
I mean the skin part.
is this funny to you? The most important case of my career?
I haven't even taken the bloody job yet, Zoe.
you know, unlike you, I don't need to have studied amazonian pigmies for 6 years to know that that's a lie.
you want me to do this. You do.
you don't know why you do. But you do.
did I say "serious margin for error"?
I was being generous.
or couldn't you tell.
you know, it's going to be a shame to disappoint you in the courtroom.
how can anyone think Clara killed her husband?
I've been friends with her for almost 10 years.
there's no way she could have done this.
gotta love how everyone comes out of the woodwork on cases like this.
well, they've gotta get their 15 minutes somehow.
by turning this woman's life into a circus.
Yeah. Well, we're all part of that circus now.
prosecution. Foster, you're prepping witnesses.
you two, you get jury watch.
you want us to read the jurors for the whole trial?
track 'em individually, see what makes them tick.
but then look at them as a group.
I want to know which way they're leaning.
you know, the leaders, the followers.
well go on.
you're not just doing this to push Zoe's buttons.
there's something else going on here.
this is about justice, Foster.
there's something else. Zoe-related.
justice for a murder victim.
by avoiding my question, you just answered it.
I just hope for all our sakes, you know what you're doing.
join the club.
6 of the jurors look convinced Clara is guilty just from the opening arguments.
you could see approval on their faces every time the prosecutor talked.
maybe. But these 2 are for the defense.
and they've already emerged as leaders.
jurors 6, 7, and 11 were looking at them the whole time,
gauging their reaction.
which way you two leaning?
maybe he wasn't dying fast enough for her.
I mean, the guy was 30 years older than she is.
so? - So...
it can affect the power dynamic.
imbalance of power in a relationship can lead to victimization.
Oh, that struck a nerve.
that's interesting.
studies show that the most successful marriages are the ones where husbands are at least 5 years older than their wives.
so, being with an older man broadens your horizons, does it?
I'm sure Clara learned a lot from Victor.
Yeah. I'm sure she did... about denture cream.
you see, you're not listening, again.
Loker, what Torres is saying is that she needs to be stimulated and challenged.
by experience.
so, who was this old fart then, eh?
I was talking about Clara.
Nah. You weren't.
you connected with a memory, which I proceeded to be little.
sorry about that.
Oh, you cannot sing the praises of older men and then not give up details.
watch me.
all right.
what? You couldn't take me one-on-one?
Nah. Been there, done that.
ow, Loker, let go!
I promise to play nice today.
last time you said that you left claw marks.
do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
that's not possible.
excuse me.
well, no one can tell the whole truth, your honor.
I mean, it's subjective. It's filtered through our own experiences.
and that's the real truth.
well, how about promising to be honest to the best of your ability?
now, you're talking.
please, be seated. - Thank you, your honor.
Dr. Lightman, your resume speaks for itself.
you're Oxford educated. You're a doctorate in psychology.
and you're a consultant for the FBI.
as you well know, the key question in this trial is where was Clara Musso the night her husband was murdered?
the defense wants us to believe that the trauma of finding her husband dead has left Mrs. Musso unable to recall the 40 minutes between leaving him and discovering his corpse.
Dr. Lightman, in your expert opinion,
does this claim of memory loss pass the sniff test?
no.
could you elaborate?
Yeah.
it's been proven that some trauma
warfare, child abuse...
can cause memory loss.
do you have experience with such cases?
Yeah. Plenty.
I've worked with soldiers, rape victims.
memory loss is caused by degradation or abuse.
shock of a dead spouse, I mean, that'd be a first.
how about a shock of committing murder?
killers have been known to experience amnesia.
forensic psychologists call it red out.
how common is it to lie, claiming memory loss?
well, 9 out of 10 people claiming memory loss are lying.
why would they do that?
well, it's easier to say, "I can't remember." than tell the truth.
I have nothing further.
your witness, counselor.
Ahem.
permission to treat Dr. Lightman as a hostile witness?
granted. - Dr. Lightman!
I'm sorry. Won't happen again, Your Honor.
thank you.
Dr. Lightman was born hostile.
he also happens to be my ex-husband.
guilty as charged.
but, you know, it was my loss.
cause truly she is an angel.
the prosecution has touted your credentials, Dr. Lightman.
are we to understand that you possess the gift of being able to distinguish between truth and lies?
no. No. 20 years of research is not a gift, is it?
you and I know, it's a bit of a curse, really.
indeed it was.
in fact, do you recall being jeered off the stage while keynoting the Harvard Global Psychology Conference in 2005?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I do. Yeah!
Yeah, and it's bonkers.
right? Because I could have sworn that they were cheering.
they called it pop psychology.
voodoo science.
I think it's because they're scared of me.
4 years ago when we were still married,
you accused my boss of sleeping with me.
the gloves are coming off now, eh?
Objection! Your honor, that's immaterial.
Dr. Lightman, last warning.
overruled.
didn't it come out eventually that my boss...
a man... was in fact gay?
Yeah. Yeah, it did.
Yeah. I was way off the mark on that one.
but I mean, I was jealous. I was young.
I was head over heels in love. You know.
by day I'm a scientist. But by night, I'm fallible.
I'm only human.
well, I'm not questioning your humanity.
and certainly not your fallibility.
Oh, that's a relief.
you are here because of your expertise in psychology and lying.
I'm challenging that.
your flagrant manipulation of the jury notwithstanding.
OK. But when you say that your client is innocent,
you don't fully believe that.
again, you misjudge my thoughts
because I know my client is innocent.
why don't you want to hear the science then?
your testimony is limited to scientific context not specific opinions on who's lying.
all right, well, you want to hear the whole truth?
that woman over there... your client...
the black widow over there...
control yourself!
when she says she doesn't know...
Dr. Lightman.
control yourself.
well, she's lying. And that's a fact.
control yourself or I will have the judge control you!
her? Do me a favor, look at her.
she's having a tough enough time controlling herself.
Marshall, please remove this witness before I hold him in contempt.
I mean, look at her. Bulging eyes, the guilt all over her face.
I think it's the booze.
get him out of here!
Oh. Hello, darling.
what?
I hope that was part of a careful plan in there.
Careful's for lawyers and accountants, right?
I think it's very interesting of her when I called her a black widow,
she got a little pout.
her feelings were hurt.
Really? - Surprising.
shocking, huh?
I'm heading back to the office to prep more witnesses.
you coming?
I'll catch up with you.
OK. Behave.
you're right.
Hey, you need a lawyer? No, I'm only joking.
what judge you got?
Denton. Why?
Oh, Denton. He's a complete softy.
he's a pushover.
he's a bleeding heart liberal, vegetarian.
I mean, the most you're looking at there is a slap on the wrist. Well done.
no. No. I didn't do anything. It was that guy.
he mugged my wife.
Really?
I'm sorry about that.
I mean, it's just luck of the draw.
I mean, keep your chin up.
that was my wife! That was my wife!
come on! Let me go!
shouldn't my lawyer be here if you're going to talk to me?
three's a crowd, love.
excuse me? - Don't get me wrong.
she's a terrific lawyer.
she's really top-notch. And I mean that.
seems there's a lot of chemistry there between you and your ex-wife.
well, there's a lot of chemistry in Chernobyl.
you know what's interesting, Dr. Lightman.
we both have something in common.
Oh yeah.
we both married up.
Hah.
you really miss him, do you?
Victor?
you're the expert.
when I say I loved my husband, what do you see?
well, you can love a man and kill him.
or have him killed.
look me in the eye and tell me you believe I killed my husband.
tell me about those 40 minutes you can't remember.
find whoever murdered Victor and I'll tell you whatever you want.
Oh, I see. You got someone in mind then.
Victor gave me more than I ever wanted.
we were partners in everything.
all the charities.
I converted to catholicism so I could share that with him too.
why would I end that?
what the hell is going on?!
I'm tampering with your client.
are you always this relentless?
to the point of self-destruction. Officer!
you wanted your father's money, didn't you?!
you were desperate and you wanted his money so, you framed your stepmother.
the hell I did! That's crazy!
see, that's wrong.
I mean the worst thing you can do is match your questioner's intensity.
instead give a firm, deliberate answer.
here, watch.
the reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.
you lie!
it's not true.
the president clenches his jaw, slight hints of anger, but then he modulates his voice and folds his hands. Ok.
now, Mr O'Sullivan, did you murder Victor Musso?
certainly not.
good. Simple. Direct.
truthful.
see, I know how to handle myself under pressure, Dr Foster.
I was Vic's right hand for 25 years.
riding his coattails for 25 years.
I was CFO for a "Fortune 500" company.
one last tip.
women require more eye contact than men to feel a connection.
so, I want you both to focus your attention on the female jurors.
got it?
anything to put that gold-digger away.
where was that loyalty when your father was alive?
Hey, she came onto me, ok?!
well, since it was my client you illegally tampered with,
judge Quinn has given me the authority to either keep you in here or release you.
Oh yeah? You bought her a drink or then?
give me one good reason I should let you out of here.
one good reason, all right.
Yeah. Just one. - Well...
how about you need me?
you know, a room like this in our house could have saved our marriage.
goodbye, Cal.
your client's innocent, by the way.
I found out while I was tampering with her.
think I'll take a nap.
don't pretend you don't need my help, Cal.
why do you do it?
do what?
you know, keep forcing us together like this.
paging Dr Kinsey.
do you want to switch to my side?
what? And stop all this fun we're having here?
you must be joking.
the fact of the matter is, your client's innocent and the jury are about to convict her.
no, they're not. - Yeah, they are.
please.
fair enough. You're the boss.
stop it.
a little role playing never hurt anyone.
I should let you rot in here.
can't argue with you there, darling.
Marshall, here's the authorization for what I'm sure will be a huge mistake.
Clara didn't care about me.
she didn't care about my father.
she just wanted his money.
all right, let's pretend the jury's watching. Ok?
now, tell them exactly how Clara seduced you.
Ah, it was a week after she had interviewed my dad about the clinics he built in Africa.
and she was at our ranch.
I didn't know that they had already become involved.
she wanted a tour.
I was showing her the wine cellar.
and that's when it happened.
all right. That was good eye contact and posture, Damien.
but remember, fold your hands to avoid fidgeting.
got it.
how many times did you have sex?
maybe 6 or 7.
then maybe undercuts your credibility with the jurors.
especially with these 2.
all right.
give them a specific number.
7
but when she found out that I didn't have any money and that it was all in a trust until I was 40, she dumped me. The next thing I know, she's engaged to my father.
and he is changing his will.
where was the last place you and Clara had sex?
I don't know. They all kind of run together.
let's get some caffeine. You know, it always helps me focus.
so, tell me what happened in the wine cellar.
I was showing her my dad's collection, and she asked to see my belt buckle.
and you took it off or did she?
she did.
help yourself.
all right, you just watch the images.
and we'll monitor your reactions on the outside.
give me the finger.
Ah, that's charming, isn't it?
are you this hands-on with all your clients?
well, I'm not afraid to get a little dirty when necessary.
hmm.
all right, so you...
say you didn't kill your husband.
I believe you're innocent.
well, I can't say this feels like a vote of confidence.
well, you still don't remember what happened that night, so, a few faces from the case might jog your memory.
have fun.
how is this supposed to help jog her memory?
it's not. It's nonsense.
but since she's lying to us about those 40 minutes, we're coming at it from another angle.
Oh, flag that one.
contempt when she looks at Damien.
well, your stepson says you're sleeping together the same time you're bedding daddy... that can bring contempt.
Yeah, and in my country, a new member of the royal family.
flag that one.
push in on her hand.
Ooh.
who's that woman she's reacting to?
that's Tanya Wilson. It's a close friend of Clara's.
she comes to court every day to support her.
well, that hand closing like that... is anger.
what happened in the 40 minutes you left Victor?
what... I... I don't remember.
that's bullocks, Clara.
do you know who killed your husband?
you know I don't. - That's enough, Cal.
too right it is.
you're lying. I can't help ya.
uncooperative witness... that's common.
uncooperative client... that's rare.
well, Crosby hired us as experts.
can't you just tell her you're sure she didn't do it?
it's a matter of pride for Crosby at this point.
you know, what passes for truth in a courtroom isn't necessarily the whole truth.
I love you too.
out.
Clara was trying to hide her anger toward Tanya.
Yeah, I need some background on that one.
right. And we saw Clara's contempt for Damien.
what does she say about her affair with him?
she's adamant it never happened.
Damien came onto her. She said no.
it's he said, she said.
when I was prepping him, I asked them about their last sexual encounter, and he just stood there holding a pot of coffee.
I mean, he couldn't fill his cup while giving the details.
manual tasks are harder to integrate when you're faking a story.
Yeah, but I believed him the first time around.
what if his story is an obsessive fantasy?
if he played it out in his head enough, he could have said it really happened without showing any signs of deception.
so, Clara rejects Damien for his father, who's shadow he lives in.
it could have driven him to murder.
we need to get Damien back in here.
now, that's dangerous.
hmm.
you think I need more prep work before I testify?
there are a few more techniques Dr. Lightman wants to go over.
anything for my father.
you slut.
that's pure science. How was it?
all right, come on.
Damien! Damien, you lied!
you were never involved with Clara were you?
she seduced me!
you're pathetic, Damien.
you're pathetic!
how could you do this?!
we wanted to see how angry it made you to see her with somebody else.
you think I killed my father?!
no. No. But you've been lying about an innocent woman.
she is a gold-digger!
how can you say that?!
this was your plan all along!
I loved your father more than anything!
no, you used him! You wanted...
Ohh! Whoa. Whoa! Whoa!
Hey!
let's go!
let it go.
fair enough.
I expected a little bit more than a slap from the world's most notorious murder suspect.
Yeah. Well, I guess I've been respectable for too long.
I think I can help you with that.
Hey, doc, Damien Musso called my office this morning.
he said you all but accused him of murder.
well, Clara didn't kill her husband, right?
I see. You switched sides.
I mean, how can I compete with legs, cleavage & associates.
you can't.
Hah.
you know that affair Damien said he had with Clara?
he was lying. Call him to the stand. It's perjury.
we had a contract, doc.
look, I render my services as an expert.
we prepped your witnesses for ya. We read your jury. Job done.
well, it's going to be a long time before you get any business from my office.
I'm devastated.
Really? - Yeah.
I'll see you in there, counselor.
that's interesting.
what?
he's not worried at all about Damien.
and, uh, he doesn't give a toss about me coming over to the other side.
if anything, he's more confident than usual.
he's up to something.
Mr. O'Sullivan, why did you hire a private investigator to look into Clara's past?
I'd been friends with Victor since we were 10 years old in catechism at St. Bernard's.
when I realized Victor was getting serious about Clara,
I wanted to make sure her intentions were sincere as a friend first and as a business partner.
and did the investigator find anything criminal?
no. She reinvented herself though.
new name. New hair color. New resume.
well, breaking with the past isn't always easy.
to your knowledge, was Victor happy in his marriage?
Yes. But he didn't have all the facts.
reviewing the estate yesterday, I discovered something...
objection, Your Honor. Any information he has about the estate should have been brought forth in deposition.
are you certain that you made the discovery yesterday?
Yes. I'm certain.
no, he's lying, Your Honor.
he's been sitting on it. So has the D. A.
that's absurd.
your Honor, I move to clear the whole gallery.
muzzle your ex, Ms. Landau, or I will.
proceed with your finding.
when I looked at Victor's sub-accounts,
I discovered monthly withdrawals of roughly $90, 000, spread across the last year and a half.
Clara was stealing from him.
he's not lying.
motion for recess, Your Honor.
I need time to research these claims.
you can recall the witness when prosecution rests, Ms. Landau.
you're leaving?
Yeah. That jury's 12 to nothing to convict.
you're screwed.
so, if Clara stole money from her husband, why did we switch sides.
Lightman screwed up?
well, Foster always says, the closer you are to someone emotionally, the harder it is to get a true read.
Yeah, but Clara is a stranger.
Zoe isn't. Anything she touches, Lightman is going to bring baggage to it.
Hey, speaking of baggage, you want to unload some of your own, like that memory that Lightman saw?
Loker. - What?
what kind of age difference are we talking about here? 10 years?
we're not discussing this.
did you violate state laws or something?
no.
decency laws?
it was a totally legal and healthy relationship.
that's exciting. Come on. Give me something.
what are you hiding? At least give me his name.
Denise Watson.
Tanya Wilson, as I live and breathe.
Clara's best mate.
Why's she so angry with you then?
I didn't know that she was.
Really?! How long have you two been friends?
I don't have to talk to you.
that's true. That's true.
but I'll see to that while you explain to a jury why you got so scared when Leo testified that Clara was stealing from her husband.
I was scared for Clara as a friend.
Ahh. Were you two in it together?
were your robbing the old man blind.
as I was going through a tough time. Clara was helping me out.
see, there's that fear again.
I think you're hiding something.
I think you're here just to make sure she keeps her mouth shut.
ridiculous.
I smell blackmail.
of a sexual variety. What is it?
is it you and Clara?
you and Victor?
no, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait a minute. Three's a crowd, right?
you and Victor and Clara.
what you got on him? You got photos?
you got video?
you got dirty knickers?
I had nothing to do with his death.
my money's on video.
I think you got a sex tape.
about 90 grand a month's worth.
Clara met him through me.
her life was supposed to be mine.
it's not like they were going to miss it.
well, thanks for that.
now, if you want to stay out of jail,
I'm gonna need that sex tape.
it was Vic's 60th birthday, and I wanted to do something he'd never forget.
in every other way he was conservative.
but this was a fantasy of his.
so, Tanya and I got together.
we were friends at that point or so I thought.
so, those 40 minutes that you claim you can't remember...
all right...
that's when you nipped out to pay off Tanya. Yeah?
it was meant to stop. But when I got there, she said that the were going to keep going.
but you couldn't tell your husband about the blackmail?
or your lawyer?
it would have confirmed everything that people had been saying about me.
and his reputation meant the world to him.
you're willing to go to jail to preserve that reputation?
true love.
I know. It's absolute insanity.
hmm.
I'm innocent, Zoe.
and I thought maybe you could somehow make the jury see that.
well, speaking of the jury, we've been reading them, and they're 12 to nothing to convict.
I mean, it's one thing to say you're innocent.
but, you gotta show them who's guilty.
well, we know we can rule out Damien.
who else has access to your house?
the only other person with a key was Leo.
he just smeared you in court.
I was stealing.
he stands to benefit financially if you're convicted.
he's the executor of the estate.
there is no way. Vic and Leo were more than business partners.
they were like brothers.
Yeah, well so was Brutus and Caesar.
put me back on the stand again.
what?
just ask, Loker.
so, you sleep with women too?
Wow.
you just went to a whole new level of blunt.
well, it has serious ramifications.
my competition may have just doubled.
I was curious, ok?
Denise was funny and interesting.
and I liked her smile.
Mm... hmm.
I didn't make a life choice.
right.
so, just to confirm.
not bisexual then.
it was experimenting, Loker.
OK.
and you know, why can girls do it and guys can't?
Where's the fantasy in that?
anyways, who really cares what people do in their bedrooms.
everyone.
so...
this experiment.
what were your findings?
you know, scientifically speaking.
you hold yourself out as an arbiter of people's honesty, yet time and again you've reversed yourself, Dr. Lightman.
Yeah. Yeah, well, scientists, see, they admit their mistakes.
ex-wives... that's an entirely different story.
the fact is your science is completely unreliable.
I mean, you're a glorified fortuneteller. A hack.
all right, well, let's see if the jury agrees, shall we?
the foreman, he's high as a kite, and he has been all along.
that one, she's getting off on Clara's misery, she is.
and those 2 over there, they're having an affair.
they're doing the dirty back at the hotel.
both of them married to different people.
and that one has got a serious foot fetish.
Dr. Lightman, for God's sake!
well, no. My point is I can read anyone here.
right. Not just the defendant or the judge.
if you're hiding something, I'll know it.
and yet you never turn that scrutiny on yourself, Dr. Lightman. Why is that?
that would terrify you, wouldn't it?
to be striped bare the way you strip the people around you.
I'm not a killer, counselor.
but neither is Clara Musso.
move to strike, Your Honor.
sustained.
the real killer has been hiding in plain sight all along.
he's in this very courtroom as we speak.
Objection! Speculation!
Dr. Lightman, this court has indulged you more than enough. Step down now, please.
please. Please step down before I have you arrested.
if you're gonna arrest somebody, you should arrest Leo O'Sullivan.
he killed his best friend, right, Leo?!
Marshall, remove him from the court.
you bastard! I didn't murder Vic. I'd never!
Oh, that's the truth, see. You didn't murder him, but you did kill him, didn't you?
all right. Dr. Lightman is out of court.
what does that mean...
Leo killed Victor but he didn't murder him?
well, when he said he didn't murder Victor, there was no sign of deception, right?
but when I asked him if he killed his friend, he flashed regret.
look, if I recall Leo to the stand...
we crack the case.
he's right on the edge. He just needs one more shove.
spit it out then.
well, since you asked. When is killing your friend a good thing?
please be seated.
I thought I kicked your ex-husband out of my courtroom, counselor?
Dr. Lightman is essential for my client's defense, Your Honor.
he's just here to observe.
he won't be a nuisance to the court.
well, if he is, he will be the guest of the county for the next 30 days.
are we clear, Dr. Lightman?
as a bell, Your Honor.
proceed.
Mr. O'Sullivan, I wish to remind you that you are still under oath.
I'd like to apologize for the previous outburst.
it's clear to me and to everyone in this courtroom how close you were to Victor Musso.
you were his best friend, his lifelong confidant.
and you would do anything to protect him.
and his reputation.
that's true.
I'd like to show the witness some photos, if I may.
Objection! - No. No. You can't.
there were no pictures submitted during discovery.
easy love, jury's watching.
sidebar, Your Honor?
please.
you can't let them see those pictures.
everything Vic worked for would be ruined.
if you try and stop this, I'll do those 30 days with bells on, just after I finish blurting it out to the jury.
these could do irreparable harm to the reputation of the deceased.
I don't know how this is germane to the case.
it speaks to the accusation that Clara was stealing from her husband.
I don't want to besmirch a good man if I don't have to.
but I do reserve the right to present these in open court.
I take your point, counselor.
all right. Please.
thank you.
you want to see Clara Musso locked up for murder.
she betrayed a man who loved her.
she was sleeping with his son for God sakes.
well, thanks to Dr. Lightman, that's been exposed as a lie.
she was stealing from him.
which you knew about. And yet you never said a word.
he was completely under her spell.
I was protecting him.
well, I submit to you that Clara was doing the same.
protecting him.
and the money you say my client was stealing from him was in fact being put to a good and noble cause.
am I being clear enough here, Mr. O'Sullivan?
perfectly, counselor.
you also knew she didn't kill her husband, sir.
but you thought she deserved to go to prison anyway, didn't you?
because after all, you had built a company and a reputation side-by-side with Victor for 25 years.
and overnight, your best friend became a different person.
Clara had displaced you.
No! When it mattered, Victor called me.
there we go. Watch this.
hold on to your seat, love.
like when it came to his health?
that's fear.
but without shame.
he's proud of what he did.
you didn't murder him, Leo.
he asked you to end his life, didn't he?
Objection!
overruled.
how was Mr. Musso's health just prior to his death?
you're under oath.
he was...
secretly very sick.
and that's why he wanted you to help him end his life, to assist his suicide. Isn't that right?
objection, your honor!
the court is very interested in Mr. O'Sullivan's answer.
he had a degenerative brain disease.
doctors gave him a month or two.
you bought the cyanide and the syringe.
he called you to his home.
and you gave him that injection, didn't you?
your honor! - Take your seat.
Victor was devout.
I mean, to him suicide was a mortal sin.
I couldn't say no to my friend.
which is why you never told him that Clara was stealing, because he was dying.
why break his heart on top of everything else?
do you have proof it wasn't a murder?
he left a video explaining.
now that right there.
that is shame.
I think his widow has a right to see that.
but I didn't imagine that I'd meet a woman who would understand me so completely.
our marriage was a gift, Clara.
happiest 10 years of my life.
I wouldn't let anything tarnish that.
Zoe says that Leo is pleading guilty to obstruction of justice and manslaughter.
and they're working out a deal.
that's good then.
thank you for everything.
I should have trusted you sooner.
well, I could say the same thing.
I've got a meeting waiting.
she's a beautiful woman.
she's my Leo.
what about Zoe?
well, to say you stopped loving someone you once loved more than anything else in the world, I mean that would be a lie.
but you move on.
don't you?
you have to move on.
she's my daughter's mum.
sometimes sparring partner.
any other women populating your life?
none you need to worry about.
I'm taking over Victor's businesses and charities.
Oh yeah?
people are going to come after me. They think I'm weak.
I need someone I can trust.
well, you got my number.
so to speak.
my point is, right, that the reason that we won was because the whole truth came out, which... no, cause it doesn't normally happen in a courtroom.
Mm-hmm.
why'd you take this case?
I thought it'd be a bit of fun.
that's not it. Not really.
well, it's your first time out there.
it's a big national case.
you were protecting me?
Oh, that's so sweet.
and paternalistic and patronizing.
Yeah. You got a point there. - Hmm.
no, but look. If you get a guilty woman off, you're a punch line.
if you convict an innocent man, you're a joke.
you've worked far too hard to get where you are.
you deserve a bit of respect.
not infamy.
still waiting for you to get what you deserve.
well, I'm 2 steps ahead of the hangman.
Emily's sleeping at a friend's.
what? The whole night?
all right. - I'll get the check.
Yeah.
my father worked for 25 years spilling sweat and blood.
without him, they'd be nowhere.
and now new owners come in, and they want to put him down like an old horse.
as God is my witness, I won't let them get away with it.
little over the top.
sit down, Amelia. You're making me nervous.
she's making you nervous?
Hey, how did we spend $200 on handkerchiefs?
I'm studying magic.
Lucha Libre has been in our family for generations.
they want me to retire based on my age.
they want me to lose a fight, have my mask taken off in the ring.
I think I deserve a fair shot.
and why you keep looking at my daughter?!
uh, I- I wasn't. I, um
I- I thought I saw something behind your daughter. - Daddy, stop.
I agree with you, ultimo. He was talking to you. But he was looking at your daughter.
no, I- I wasn't. - He kind of was.
no, I was looking to see if there was- You were looking at my daughter!
eh, just joking.
I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.
it's a simple arraignment.
I thought budget cuts did away with night court.
no, I asked for it. To throw off the media jackals.
if we enter a plea now, they miss a news cycle.
Oh, perhaps another athlete will text photos of his genitals
wipe this mess off the front page.
good evening, Your Honor.
due to the seriousness of this case
actually, why don't you let her do the talking?
sorry, Your Honor.
force of habit.
Brett caiman, Your Honor.
your reputation precedes you.
thank you.
to the charge of murder in the first degree, on behalf of my client, Stanton Infeld, we enter a plea of "Not guilty.
Mr. Infeld is prepared to surrender to custody.
the defendant is remanded. No bail.
bailiff, take him into custody.
Ow! No!
I haven't done anything yet!
man, he is hopeless. Ultimo, show me.
you've never been to the Santa Monica Pier?
it's the eighth-highest Ferris Wheel in America.
did you just make that up?
Yes. I did. Just now.
isn't there something about lawyers and their clients...?
which is why I'm not asking out your father.
otherwise, I would,'cause he's right in my wheelhouse, but... Uh, I got to take this.
Hey, guys, did you see this?
Peter and Jared, in the office.
urgent. - Yeah.
okay, okay. U-u-ultimo, I have to go.
Hey.
does anyone know what's going on?
I have an idea.
if this is one of Infeld's trust-building exercises
it's not.
I'm Brett Caiman. I'm with the -- - New York office.
what's going on?
Stanton is in lockup. He's being held without bail.
for what? - Murder.
I get it. - Yeah.
this is one of those murder-mansion mystery things.
Oh, I love those! Love these things. - Vintage Infeld.
all right, who's the victim?
Gibson Hawke. - That's a cool name!
he was one of my Uncle's best friends.
disappeared 15 years ago. They were climbing Mount McKinley together.
which is where his body was found five days ago.
I don't have much more information yet.
I'm starting to think- This is real?
Yeah, we should stop talking now.
but why are we hearing this from you?
new York wanted someone sent out to oversee things until the situation plays itself out.
well, enjoy your stay,'cause I don't work for you.
actually, you do.
Karp, Franklin, and Bash, you're trial team-- Stanton's call.
there's a surprise.
everything case-related goes through me.
that's it for now.
I'll be handling discovery.
I'll need two of you overseeing...
is Stanton okay? - What's with her?
she's been a trial assassin.
now she works the cases from behind the scenes, you know, manipulates the media.
Why? We got this.
Yeah. For once, you and I agree.
I'm gonna go see Stanton. - Let's go.
you two busy? I've got something to show you.
actually, we're gonna go see Infeld right now.
Yeah, it's not a request.
meet you outside in five minutes. I'll drive.
when I started out at the D. A.'s office, they taught me it was critical to see the most important witness, the one the jury never gets to hear from-- the victim.
why are his eyes open?
uh, let me guess -- uh, your first corpse?
not mine. Premed.
one medical man to another, I noticed the decedent is still clothed.
Yes, well, due to the condition we found the body in, we were only able to conduct a partial autopsy.
fantastic, can we just concentrate on the second-most important person on the case?
there's no way Stanton's guilty.
he told authorities 15 years ago that, when the blizzard hit,
Hawke insisted on heading out for help, and they never saw him again.
he was 20, 000 feet up in a blizzard!
Yeah. There's all kinds of ways to die up there, right?
Yes, but Mr. Hawke died from a 6-inch stab wound to his abdomen.
what?
he was, uh, stabbed to death. And unless he was mugged by a Yeti, I'd say
Aah! - Ohh.
he moved! He moved.
he didn't move! - Interesting.
uh, it could be contractions as the ice molecules dissipate, but he's not, uh...
he's thawing out?
okay. Excuse me for a second.
Hey, hey, hey, look. Hey, okay, okay.
you're thinking "Encino man"?
can't happen. Okay?
you're in a safe place. Okay?
sorry.
here's the murder weapon-- a climbing knife, scrimshaw handle.
okay, there's got to be hundreds of knives like this.
with the name "Stanton Infeld" inscribed in the handle?
we need to see our client.
so, Stanton, we got to ask.
what? If I'm guilty?
a good lawyer never asks his client whether he's guilty or not.
come on, Stanton. You're not a client. You're family.
listen. There is a good reason why the story I told 15 years ago is inconsistent with the way that Gibson's body was found.
see? I told you so.
I lied to the police.
that's not a good reason at all.
look, Hawke and I were great friends.
I mean, we were golf and tennis partners. We even pursued the same women.
and let's just say that... More than a few wagers were made over the years, but...
that night... He was different.
he was... angry, irrational.
our guide ordered us down when we were only 200 feet from the summit.
well, Gibson refused. He said he was going on with or without us, and he
he grabbed the last oxygen container.
I- I- I tried to reason with him. I...
but he attacked me... Viciously.
so... I killed him.
you didn't have a choice.
Yeah, if he'd taken your oxygen...
he would have not only killed you but the rest of your climbing team.
well, that works for me.
it was self-defense.
we're still stuck with Infeld's lie when he came down.
Hawke was a pillar of the community.
his scholarship endowment still sends hundreds of kids to college every year.
so to preserve that...
and protect his memory for his wife and kids...
... He lied to cover up the death of a man he killed with his own hands.
well, when you put it like that... Look, Infeld's trying to protect him.
would you want to be remembered for your worst moment?
say, the Halloween you went as Hannah Montana.
not my worst moment.
and I was dressed as Miley Cyrus.
if we're gonna admit that we lied about Hawke's death, then we have to make Infeld look like a Saint through the rest of his life.
dig up whatever you can.
already did.
it's not good.
what are you doing?
compiling character testimonials for Brett.
we got trouble. - What?
private bank account in the Bahamas.
Stanton's? - Hawke's.
closed out right around the time he died.
all right, well, could be nothing, but let's check it out.
and don't tell anybody.
we've started to put together the character wi-- oh, wow!
I'm sorry. I should have-- I should have knocked.
uh, I'll just, um, leave these?
relax. I, um, need your help with something.
okay.
it involves you looking at me.
I'm going on "Anderson Cooper," see if we can't influence the jury pool a little.
which outfit's better?
that works for me.
I need to look powerful and feminine but not provocative.
what about your character evidence?
testimonials on his honesty, his character for nonviolence, the charity work.
and they've all been subpoenaed?
done.
what was that, a couple of minutes ago?
what do you mean?
I heard you say not to tell anyone.
Yes. Jared had his first full body wax.
frankly, I think he took manscaping way too far. I told him, I said
Peter... Are you sure you're keeping me looped in about everything?
hold my hair.
you're totally looped. I swear.
I know you and Franklin bend the rules.
I won't have it, not on this case.
the stakes are too high.
of course.
and I want Karp off the trial team.
K-- wha-- Karp may have a stick up his ass, but he's a good lawyer.
Yeah, and he's also Stanton's nephew.
if he argues his innocence, the jury will think, "Of course he's saying that. He's family.
well, Jared and I will handle argument.
karp is better at motions, case citations
you mean boring, grown-up stuff that wins trials?
exactly. That's why we need him on the
Yeah, it's decided.
you and Franklin.
don't screw it up.
Hanna, I heard you signed Triple B Electronics. That's a huge get.
good news travels fast.
you know, I wanted to make sure that you're okay about not being on the trial team.
I pushed for you.
I am not gonna second-guess Stanton.
well, if you're ready to work where female partners are given more than lip service...
I'm happy here.
worth a shot. - Mm.
if you don't mind keeping this between us...
not a problem. - It's New York. Excuse me.
Hanna's gonna take over the case. Maybe she can get them to listen to reason.
who are these guys?
Dalton and Jacks, the league owners.
you should be represented by counsel, gentlemen.
unless he's your lawyer.
we're lawyers. - We're also...
then, who's this?
el presidente.
we are making him the next ultimo.
look, I know this is an emotional issue, but
uh, not for us. We own the league.
which means we own all the characters in the league, including Ultimo.
you like letting women speak for you?
I'll tell you what -- why don't you give me the mask, and I'll find you a skirt?
why don't you shut up? - Okay, Amelia.
they're just trying to get a rise out of us. Let's just stay calm.
that's weird. She wasn't too upset last night in my room.
why don't you say that to my face?!
you want to be a dead man?
I'll handle this, J.
and who's gonna teach me, huh? You, old man?!
soon. Someday soon.
I should be on this case.
if it were any other trial.
you're the most promising attorney.
Yeah, I could care less what you think of my lawyering.
but you do care what the judicial selection committee thinks.
wh-- h- how do you know
that you want to be a judge?
one of my law-school professors is on the committee.
I got you bumped up the list.
I'd prefer to keep it between us. It's a little sensitive.
you need to let me help my Uncle.
you want to help? Step aside.
it's the toughest thing to do. But sometimes, it's the smart move.
I found a croquet set.
where would you like it set up?
uh, on the south field.
Oh, wait a minute. The Rolling 40 Crips are playing softball now, aren't they?
listen, set it up 3: 00. - Yes, sir.
Hello, Damien. - Hi.
you-you heard that Brett took me off the case?
Yes, I'm -- I'm sorry, Damien.
but, you know, I hate to admit this, but she probably did the right thing.
Oh, by the way, I saw her last night on "AC360.
Wow! Is she ever compelling.
Stanton, this is serious.
look, appearances to the contrary, Damien... I am concerned.
but to be honest with you, I've been half-hoping that this day would come, when I could be judged for what I've done.
that was an honest moment.
there was, uh, no zen-master, Yoda-style deflecting.
the D. A. has to prove that Stanton Infeld killed Gibson Hawke.
I'll save her some time. He did.
he stabbed him, walked down the mountain, and lied about it.
that's the Stanton Infeld the D. A. wants you to know.
but you're gonna meet the real Stanton, the one I know, the one who sees the good in everyone and everything...
the Stanton Infeld who took a shot on two lawyers who were, well, let's just say, not setting the legal world on fire.
objection.
while I agree with Mr. Franklin's characterization of himself and his partner, uh, can he make one thing not about Franklin & Bash?
fair enough.
let's talk about two other people you'll hear from-- Mike Lane and Rachel Ford.
again, objection. Those witnesses haven't been provided.
that's because Mikey is 11 and Rachel's 9.
where are you going with this?
your Honor, obviously, Mike and Rachel were not on the mountain.
but their grandfathers -- both on the climb, since deceased after long, full lives -- were.
and had it not been for Stanton Infeld's heroism,
Mike and Rachel would have never known their grandfathers.
because Gibson Hawke would have killed everyone up there...
...including himself.
I got this in El Paso-- an exposed nail in the ring.
and how much time did you miss?
I fought the very next night.
we object to this testimony. It's irrelevant.
no one's disputing his commitment.
we thank him and invite him to take all the time he needs, starting now.
the contract -- - Let's forget the contract.
I'm sure she'd like that.
miss Linden, this is a court of law. We can't "forget" the contract.
all we're asking is that you look at the spirit of the contract.
I mean, we can't bargain for a man's dignity.
Ah, but you can for ownership of a character in the league.
Oh, wait. We did. Paragraph 2, subsection "b.
I'm sympathetic, but I'm bound by the law.
you may step down, sir. I'm sorry.
your Honor, please.
I am ordering all parties to return tomorrow so that you may return the mask.
Hey, make sure you wash the mask before you bring it back.
I'm an officer with the Alaskan Police Department, Denali District.
have you encountered the defendant, Stanton Infeld, before?
I have.
how do you know this guy?
I have no recollection.
and I think I would remember that mustache. It's quite impressive.
and where did the two of you meet?
at the Denali police station. I took his statement.
objection, Your Honor, we've already admitted that our client stretched the truth when he came down from the mountain.
duly noted, but this is something he said the night before they went up.
officer Werth, what were the circumstances that led you to take Mr. Infeld's statement?
it was in our drunk holding cell, after he had been booked for assault.
Mr. Infeld had been in a fistfight.
Oh, my! With whom?
your Honor, we have the defendant's booking photo from that night.
officer Werth, tell me
did Mr. Infeld say anything as he was being booked?
he was looking for Hawke.
he said, "If that son of a bitch doesn't pay up, he's a dead man.
well... He turned out to be as good as his word on that.
Objection!
withdrawn.
I didn't lie.
that looked a lot like you in the mug shot.
I'd ask,"How'd the other guy look?" But we kind of know.
honestly, I- I had forgotten.
how do you-- how do you forget an ass-whipping like that?
you don't know this about me. I used to live pretty hard.
I am from Liverpool.
I mean, I could never have just one drink or sleep with one woman.
or be second-best, ever!
I mean, I'd have a row the same way you guys squabble over oatmeal.
who fights over oatmeal?
Precisely!
you want to say it or should I?
you think he's guilty?
it's hard to argue self-defense when he called his shot three days before he did it.
sounds like specific intent to me.
we got the crap beat out of us in court today. We need something good.
Hey. Uh, come on in.
this is what they want.
do we really have to be there tomorrow?
Yeah, I'm sorry about what happened in court.
if you could just give us one second,
I'll, uh, figure out how to handle tomorrow, okay?
as far as Infeld's testimony -- - Dude, stop.
what? - She digs you.
God knows why, but, yeah, it looks like she does.
go comfort her. - We're in the middle of a case.
even Frodo took breaks when returning the ring to Mount Doom.
never mind that. Just go.
we've been at it all night. Take five.
Lucha used to just be his job. But when my mother died...
I'm sorry.
...he got wrapped up in his character.
I thought it was to avoid mourning.
then I realized that's how he mourned.
we're not giving up on this, Amelia.
it's not just about him.
being a Lucha fan isn't like rooting for the Lakers.
Ultimo stands for good.
he's a folk hero.
I know it sounds dumb, but it's-- - No, what it sounds like is awesome.
you don't meet many folk heroes.
you'd have made a good Luchador.
Yeah, I would have.
Yeah, but not as good as me,'cause I know all the moves.
you know all the-- - Mm-hmm.
all right. Bring it. Let's see. Break 'em out, Sally.
all right.
Oh, I could do that. Ow. Okay.
all right, that's effective.
Oh, wow! Okay. - There.
I could make you tap out in 15 seconds.
well, you could try, but-- okay!
I'm tapping out. There it is.
my father came up with it.
well done. - Yeah.
all the Luchadors use it, along with a bunch of other holds he developed.
let me try it on you. Fair is fair.
okay. - All right.
so this arm goes here and-- whoa!
I don't know what move that is, but you should copyright it.
wait.
what's wrong?
what you just said -- your case.
okay, don't move.
I'll be right back. - Okay.
okay! All right. I really have to go.
Hey, I was just coming to find you.
I'm about to have sex-- crazy Lucha sex with the daughter of a man who could, and most likely will, just tear my head off.
but I got to tell you something quick, so go ahead. - No, no, go first.
no, you look like -something's wrong. - No, go.
we got to get Hanna on the phone, get her over here now.
you thinking threesome?
no. Maybe. No.
no. Look, Amelia was showing me some of Ultimo's moves, and then I figured out how to win the case, all right?
I'm gonna say two words, then I'm gonna get back to having the sex I so richly deserve-- "Copyright law.
good, but I don't think you're gonna have time for that threesome, - or even the twosome. - No, no, you said
come on. Come on.
tell him.
I accessed the banking system in Jamaica.
Accessed"?
well, if they spent less time smoking giant blunts and not washing their hair and more time on building firewalls
Whoa! Whoa! I can't even believe you just said that.
you know what, if you spent less time in your little germ-free fortress
no, that's what they do.
they smoke blunts and-- You're racist!
I'm not white. I can't be racist. - Yes, you are.
stop! Both of you!
Gibson Hawke's bank account was closed out three days after his death.
by Infeld.
you know, Hawk and I were like brothers
well, so were Cain and Abel.
you know, we had a slush fund in the form of an offshore account for gambling.
if anything happened to the other, who was ever left would empty the account and disburse the money to charity.
well, because of the way I lived, I always assumed that it would fall to him.
Stanton, I don't know how to say this, but maybe we should consider, you know, pleading guilty.
Yeah, that's- that's smart.
a-a lawyer should always be dispassionate.
so you want us to...
look, if I thought for one moment that I murdered my friend,
I would have pled guilty that night.
now, although I can admire your skepticism, if you guys want to step aside,
I'd be happy to represent myself from here on out.
that's not gonna be necessary.
we're gonna win this for you.
I made it clear that you were to surrender the mask
we're filing a counterclaim against the league for violating Ultimo's intellectual-property rights.
I want that mask! It's my time!
Mr. Jacks, please tell your associate to pipe down, or I'll have my bailiff...
escort him out of the courtroom. - What?
while the league owns Ultimo, they don't own whatever moves he developed while he was
that's ridiculous, Your Honor. The moves are part of the character.
can you show me where it says that?
your Honor, you said you were bound by the contract, which lists all rights granted to the league, but it doesn't mention moves.
it's weak, Miss Linden.
weak? It's-- it's comatose, Your Honor.
it's enough to take it to trial.
your client may keep the mask...
... Until the issue has been further litigated.
nice work.
it's in the bag, and you do the comatose joke.
the trial won't be for another three months, so until then
they can't take the mask. I know.
and I know, to you, it's just a mask.
and I know how I must look.
you don't look- I kept this for 25 years by fighting for it.
and thank you for fighting for me, really, but I didn't climb into the ring every night to have some piece of paper tell me whether or not I deserve this mask.
that night on the mountain, when you stabbed Mr. Hawke, you had no choice, isn't that correct?
I had a choice.
I could have let the rest of my team perish on that mountain, or...
I could have killed my best friend.
and lied about it.
look, I've had occasion to re-live every moment.
Ah, of course I have regrets, but protecting the name of my best friend, even if I had to lie about it, isn't one of them.
thank you. No further questions.
you said you and Mr. Hawke beat each other up and that was just part of your competitive natures.
Yes, that's right.
and you had no motive to kill him?
no. I loved that man.
hmm, then, perhaps you can explain why you emptied out his bank account three days after his death?
Objection! - You've been a lawyer a long time.
wouldn't you agree that money is a pretty compelling motive
objection, Your Honor! - Your Honor!
counsel, approach.
she cannot blindside us with new evidence in the middle of trial.
well, it shouldn't be too much of a surprise, seeing as how we got it from someone at Infeld/Daniels.
what are you up to?
why don't we take this in my office?
you mean Stanton's office?
what, you don't want everyone knowing that you're helping the D. A. convict him?
I'm not going to apologize for following the rules.
it's the responsibility of both parties to turn over all evidence
that you plan on using in court, which we weren't.
which I'd know if I was kept in the loop.
I hear you talking about a bank account, it shows up on the firm's server...
so you send it to the D. A?
along with hundreds of other documents.
I don't know what your motive is here, other than helping the other side send Infeld to prison, but we're done taking orders from you.
we got a case to win. Our way.
I hope you do.
for all your sakes.
that's right.
Franklin and Bash! No one tells us what to do!
except Infeld.
and Carmen. - Yeah.
karp sometimes. - Speaking of Karp...
I heard about court today. I was just gonna go see Stanton.
you want back on the trial team?
hell, yeah. But what about Brett?
you gonna let her tell you what to do?
last time I checked, we run this place.
uh, no, you don't. I'm in.
trial team group hug? - Let's do it.
no.
Hey.
what have you been talking about with Brett?
she's offering me a senior partnership in New York.
thought it was something like that.
don't trust her.
Why? Is she lying?
worse.
she
you may have fooled the judge, but when he's forced -to look at the con
what's up?!
what the-- what the hell's going on here?
we invited him.
you know, there are better ways to handle all of this.
Yeah, the Lucha way.
I'm not afraid. You afraid?
hell, no. Let's do this.
okay, we- We decide when a fight is sanctioned, so
then sanction it!
your guy wins, you get the mask.
Ultimo wins, he keeps it and gets to defend his title.
either way, you get to promote the fight and collect the gate.
done. - Done.
I already said "done." - Well, I just wanted it clear.
she knows.
we're done.
thank you.
don't thank me. Kick his ass.
bend your knees.
Ernie, uh, take over.
Hey, stick with the wuji. - Yeah.
you okay?
Yes. Thank you for asking. I'm okay.
you know we still have a shot.
you know, you boys did yourself, and me, very proud.
I still wish there was someone else to tell the story.
well, unfortunately, dead men tell no tales.
actually, Stanton, they do.
call the court. Tell them we have one more witness.
stay with Stanton.
just another moment, Your Honor.
you have conducted yourself with surprising decorum.
I only hope that when Mr. Bash arrives, he doesn't have one of your desperate stunts up his sleeve.
no, Your Honor. - I'm here!
as its final witness, the defense calls... Gibson Hawke to the stand.
told you it wasn't a stunt.
over my dead body.
got a minute?
I've got one.
what can I help you with?
go back to New York, for starters.
excuse me?
we've been looking at the firm's charter, at the line of succession here in the L.A. office.
and if my Uncle's convicted, I'm next in line.
then me, but if we're not around...
Yeah, say, if one of us becomes a judge and the other one goes to New York...
I have no intention of staying in L.A.
Really? That's weird.
because you've been looking at houses in Bel Air with a broker.
and how would you know that?
involving yourself in a murder trial where you stood to gain by your client being convicted.
that's not gonna play well on "Anderson Cooper," is it?
step aside, Brett.
it's the toughest thing to do. But sometimes, it's the smart move.
that was like a minute, right?
Yeah. - Yeah. Awesome.
I've cleared the courtroom, and I have my special "Contempt of the court" pen at the ready, gentlemen.
I hate that pen.
you are asking to bring a corpse into my courtroom?
no, t-that would be ridiculous.
we want to bring the court to him.
jury field trip to the morgue.
a field trip? Really?
you sure you got signed permission slips from your moms?
actually, we got one from yours.
last night. - Enough!
if you can find me one case where a body was brought into the court
Formosus. Not the most current case. It's from '96.
Yeah, that's 15 years ago. That's fine.
actually, Your Honor... 896.
so 1, 100 years ago.
no, Your Honor, please wait. - Your Honor, Your Honor, papal courts of Rome. They dug up Formosus and tried him posthumously.
I meant a case from this millennium or the last millennium.
okay, well, since we're talking about dead people, let me mention another one-- Thomas Jefferson.
he wrote a little thing called the Constitution.
you are kidding, right?
maybe the founding fathers are a joke to D. A. "Nutella," but not for us.
the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment.
it states that a defendant is entitled to face his accuser.
took con law three times.
face his accuser? He's dead.
look, the prosecution's theory has been that our client hated Gibson Hawke.
we've argued that Infeld would never hurt Gibson Hawke.
all we're saying is, enough talk from the lawyers.
well, I can't disagree with that.
let the jury gauge for itself how Mr. Infeld reacts to facing his friend.
you said if we cited a case, Your Honor.
your words.
okay. Let's have a field trip.
you want to sit together on the bus?
no, I want to stab myself in the eye with your tiny body.
think she likes me.
have you had further occasion to conduct analysis on Gibson Hawke?
Yes, I've taken samples of brain tissue.
we have an implement that allows us to drill directly
okay, we get-- we get the picture.
your Honor, a moment with counsel?
you look pale. - He's smiling now.
okay, all right. Tag out, Lucha style. I got this.
what my woozy partner meant to say was, why didn't you do it before?
well, based on the stab wounds, the cause of death seemed clear.
and what did your new autopsy show?
at the time of his death, Mr. Hawke was suffering from hypoxia, otherwise known as mountain fever.
and what are some of the symptoms?
uh, psychotic breaks, irrational rage, extreme violence.
so, if Mr. Hawke was in one of these rages, a person acting in self-defense could have had to stab Mr. Hawke in order to stop him.
objection. He's creating his own scenario.
based on the evidence. Same as you.
the only difference is, you have to prove yours beyond a reasonable doubt.
overruled.
Mr. coroner man
uh, Mr. Conti. Bruce Conti.
isn't it possible-- excuse me
reasonable that my client was acting not only in defense of himself but the entire climb team when he killed Gibson Hawke?
I- I would say, uh... More than reasonable.
no further questions.
decent dog and pony show.
it must've been more than decent, or you wouldn't be talking to us.
he pleads guilty to filing a false report
three years probation and 2, 000 hours of pro bono work.
seems a bit stiff.
I accept.
um, but I just have two requests. Make it 5, 000 hours.
uh, you understand how negotiating works, Stanton?
and a moment, please, with Gibson.
I never got to say goodbye.
farewell, dear friend.
perhaps now you will... Rest in peace.
that's what I've always wanted for you.
Oh, my.
come on, Ultimo!
come on, get up, get up!
whoa, whoa, whoa! This is ruenos perno. The thunderbolt.
finish him! Come on!
I taught him that!
one of the benefits of jail-- you get to realize the value of economy of space.
I mean, who needs all this room?
I just wanted to welcome you back.
I expect you're wondering why I kept you off my trial.
Yes, actually.
and you think that I value Damien, Jared, and Peter more.
it's hard not to see it that way.
you know... I kept you off my case because you mean more than they do.
you're gonna have to explain that one.
look, this firm is bigger than any one person, a-and you just won the Lucha case.
that old fighter's needs were no less important than mine.
which is why I've decided that if and when I step aside...
I want you to run this firm.
not Damien?
Oh, no. Damien, he wants to be a judge.
besides... I have my heart set on you.
welcome back.
Hey! Congratulations.
Ah, hey! Ultimo.
and Ultimo's giant friends. Congratulations, huh?
thank you. - Yeah.
we heard from the league.
they're broke. Dalton and Jacks took off.
they owe Ultimo his share of the gate.
and us our attorney fees.
right. - That blows.
it doesn't blow too bad.
they're in default, so we get whatever asset they have left.
wait. You mean
you're 50% owners of the Fuerte Lucha League.
along with me.
Yeah!
you come here. I want to talk to you.
we can talk right here.
uh, yeah, okay, um, it's good right here.
but, Ultimo, we won. You don't have to take
you're with my daughter now. That's like family.
I- I like Amelia, but I don't know if we're together, you know,"with" so much, you know.
business partners.
business partners.
thank you.
found that fake head you put in my bed.
you liked that, huh?
solid effort. - Thank you.
but I just want you to know that if we were somewhere and you started acting all crazy, it would be my honor to kill you.
Aww. I'd kill you, too, buddy. - Hey.
all right, you get to choose how and where you die.
game 7, World Series, Dodger Stadium
Jessica Alba and I making love in a luxury box.
the minute the Dodgers clinch, boom, struck by lightning-- dead.
put a lot of thought into this. - Yes, I did.
what about you?
eaten by lions. - Really?
no sleeping with Marisa Tomei or jamming with Keith?
that's selfish, man.
we gonna join, or we gonna sit back?
no, I can't.
you coming?
all right, stand here.
you're just tall enough.
I--I don't--I don't think I am.
it just goes around.
there's nothingto be scared of, all right?
I didn't say I was scared.
it'll be fun. Come on.
when I was a kid, this was my favorite thing ever.
I don't like rides.
all right, all right. I just--I though tit'd be fun.
I shouldn't be making you do this.
uh...Let's go home. We can have fun at home.
no, daddy, wait.
the ride does look like fun.
Oh, this is awesome!
Alice, are you all right?
honey, you all right?
Alice! Alice, are you okay?
nothing happened. - something happened.
it was a little kiddie ride. - She hates those rides.
I don't understand why you insist on making
okay, I appreciate the fullness of your answers, but I just wanted to know if she had any historyof abdominal problems.
no. - No.
the admitting doctornoted no family history of
I have an aunt with Crohn's disease.
you didn't mention that? - I--I forgot what it was called.
your aunt has got a million things wrong with her.
if you paid attention for five minutes.
I doubt it's crohn'S. She has none of the other systems.
you're alone with her for eight hours, she ends up in the hospital.
I'm wondering if we can focus on answering the questions, Mrs. Hartmann.
I'm not Mrs. Hartmann. We're divorced.
I suspected.
and your pasgenerosity made me think of you.
we're half a million dollars from our goal.
of course, this is a naming opportunityfor your foundation.
is--is there a problem?
there's somethingon your face.
it's, uh--ahem.
excuse me.
Oh! - Oh, god.
I'm sitting in there hoping it's a sniper because at then the sociopa thisn't my employee.
this baby won me second place in the clinic's weekly "weirdest thing pulled out of an orifice" contest.
I am this close to putting a new lab in oncology.
you do not want to know what came in first.
house. - Rhymes with "fucchini."
give me his pills.
Where's my prescription? - No more free floating prescriptions.
princeton pd has already forced wilson to shut down.
a cop says boo, Wilson shuts down.
every doctor in this place is afraid to make a move without covering his ass.
do you think maybe you're shouting at the wrong person?
Tritter's obviously out to get me. He doesn't care
your forged prescriptions! - Allegedly.
your pain has become my pain.
from now on you get reasonable dosesat reasonable times.
but I hurt in an unreasonable way.
then dip into your secret stash. - Tritter took it.
then move onto your secret secret stash. - I ran out.
then move onto your secret secret secret stash.
parents say she's not on any med.
if the pancreatitis wasn't set off by drugs, and she hasn't been sick, that leaves traumaor some kind of structural defect. Put up the ct.
what's that density there? - Shadow. Looks normal to me.
we got a referral from-- - excuse me.
you stash your drugs in a lupus textbook.
it's never lupus.
who's got gallstones, and why do we care?
gallstones? - Biliary duct is dilated.
probably from a stonelodged in it. Must've caused a nasty caseof pancreatitis.
she's six. Six-year-olds don'tget gallstones.
so she didn't have pancreatitis.
your theory is an invisible gallstone?
his theory correctly predicted pancreatitis.
you might want to wait until he actually tells us his theory before you startkissing his theory's ass.
my theory is... vanishing gallstone.
she had it, and it passed. Those things travel in packs.
the rest of them are probably hiding out in her gall bladder. Do an ultrasound.
if I'm right, we'll take out the organ so we can analyzethe stones.
I wasn't kissing his ass.
it must've just looked that way from our angle.
you on your knees, House bending over. - He predicted the pancreatitis.
it's his dad's fault. - My dad was an ass.
but you did everything he wanted you to, and in return you got everything you wanted.
Yeah, It's that simple.
the strategy worked. Dad got him a cushy job. Paid for his cushy life.
cut me out of hisushy will.
I told you. It's just his nature. Poor guy's hard wired to kiss ass.
house was right. Gallstones.
I didn't know a kid could get gallstones.
it's unusual. That's why we need to see what's causing it.
we'd like to remove Alice's gallbladder and analyze the stones.
sure. - No.
just 'causeI said sure? - I am capable of my own thoughts.
it's a simple procedure. The gallbladderisn't essential
if the doctor thinks we should do it, we should do it, Edie.
you think maybe we should get a second opinion before we start removingour child's organs?
that's an effective use of taxpayers' money.
I'm actually off this week. - I'm guessing you don't have a family.
most people have enough going on in their lives that they don't have topersonalize every slight.
this isn't personal. Not anymore.
my head of oncology had to shut down.
my entire staff are afraid to make a move without covering their ass.
I think you're angry at the wrong person.
you think Dr. Wilson deserved to have his assets seized?
his entire practice ruined? - No.
so you just don't care?
this is how I get what I want.
I put pressure on people.
and if it doesn't work on Wilson, it'll work on you.
you punish the innocent.
none of you are innocent. Not one of you.
not one of you has told me the truth. About Dr. House.
the pills allow him to cope with the pain.
no, the pills distort reality. He is an addict.
he's not out robbinga liquor store or-- - No, he's treating people.
he needs to finda different way to cope before he kills somebody.
if he hasn'tdone that already.
if you're right, he has a medical problem.
it should be dealt with by doctors, not by
well, it's not being dealt with by doctors. Doctors are covering it up.
the whole point of the criminal justice system is to make things right when everything else fails.
with all due respect...You have failed.
sorry. Didn't know you wanted your kid dead.
although, for a couple of g's I could still make it happen.
who the hell are you?
I am complete stranger who apparently cares more about whether your kid dies than you do.
you're Dr. House. - You've seen my stage show.
she's not dying. She has pancreatitis.
once you've treated that, I'm taking her home.
and do what, burn sage? I want you to do the surgery.
my father had gallstones. They were totally harmless.
Alice had one bad one, but it passed. For all we know this is over.
and for all we know she could get sick again tomorrow.
then I'll take her to her pediatrician. She's six, Rob.
she shouldn't have unnecessary surgery.
or a moron for a mom, but what can you do?
you're the doctor. I'm the mother.
I out rank you. Live with iT.
I've read the file. You've got 15 minutes.
it's like people like this who killed copernicus.
Galileo. - Either way.
and they just locked Galileo up.
they killed his spirit. Nobody likes a showoff.
luckily, Alice Hartmannhas a dad who's willing to see reason.
reason as defined by slavishly deferring to you.
their doctor.
your honor, I've had no opportunity to consult my attorney.
there's no time.
all I want is a second opinion before-- - no time!
your testimony is their child will die if I don't grant this motion right now.
am I under oath? - Let's say yes.
my testimony is that this child might die if you don't grantthis motion right now.
literally no timefor a second opinion.
wouldn't be as good as the first opinion.
Dr. Cuddy, what do you think?
she's not a specialist in this area. Her opinion is worthless.
Dr. Cuddy, what doyou think of Dr. House? Is he as big a jerk as I think he is?
bigger. But he knows what he's talking about.
got a page. - She's complaining about her stitches.
nurse just said that's completely normal.
did you get the test results for the gallstones? - Any minute now.
no time for a second opinion but the test takes
my skin hurts.
I know I no longer have the right to demand it, but could you please take a look?
sure.
she's pissed, now she's just looking for things to go wrong.
you're right, I'm so petty I hope she dies so it vindicates my opinion.
I didn't mean that, sweetie. Mommy was being sarcastic.
she's a few years away from grasping sarcasm, don't you think?
guys.
I already gave you that number.
simple surgical procedure turns a little girl into the English patient. What gives?
must be allergic to something we used in the surgery.
this is my office. I'm talking.
there are people here who work for me.
they're not listening. Explain this to me.
Tritter froze my account.
they're checking theirs. I'm on hold with a lawyer.
call Wilson's lawyer. He'll tell you exactly how and why you're screwed.
this kid has no history of allergies. - You've gotta talk to Tritter.
you gotta make this go away.
Yeah, great plan. The man's obviously open to reason.
well, here's the plan. We do nothing.
we wile away the time diagnosing the patient.
the stones were calcium bilirubinante, pigment stones，which are non-conclusive.
kid presented with low-gradefever, mild anemia.
that plus the stones indicate bacterial infection.
bacterial infections don't cause a vesicular rash.
and doing nothing is not a plan. It's specifically a lack of a plan.
we cut into her belly. Bad boys escape.
they swarm over, colonize the wounds, and...
Ka-plow! Vesicular rash.
allergic reaction is 100% more likely with or without a history.
fever and anemia could've been symptoms of pancreatitis.
Hello?
thank you for your help.
they froze my accounts. - Thank you for your help?
it's not her fault. - He hasn't gotten to mine yet.
I'm gonna withdraw and much as I can as fast as I can. Lunch is on me.
do a scratch test. Check for allergies.
when it comes up negative, startbroad-spectrum antibiotics.
bullies bully. They don't get a reaction, they lose interest.
now go do what I ask before I stick your heads in toilets.
how'd otter get here? - Daddy got him last night.
it was at the dry cleaner. They close at 6: 00. How'd you get it?
I drove over there.
I knocked for about ten minutes. And then I begged.
how about some ice cream for when this is through?
my tummy hurts. - Ginger ale?
yeah?
I'll take over. - Be right back.
he's already been really good at the big romantic gestures, but ask him to do the dishes or show up for a meal on time or drive her-- - almost done here.
what are you doing here? - I work here.
passively-aggressively you gave up your practice.
I have clinic hours.
now, you're passively-aggressively spreading peanut butter with a big sign around your neck saying, "Wilson doesn't have enough cash for the cafeteria."
you know, before Lenny Bruce died of a drug overdose...
if you're gonna confront me with everyone who ever abused narcotics,
I think I'm gonna have to get something to read...
he was arrested on obscenity charges.
he went through a series of arrests and trials because he just couldn't stop challenging the police.
he became obsessed with his own legal problems.
and his act turned into long, humorless rants about fascist cops and the violation of his rights.
I get it, I get it. I need to change my nightclub act. You think more props?
house, scratch testis getting results. A lot of results.
how could she be allergic to everything? - She can't be.
it has to be an infection.
you see a positive allergy test and decide it's infection?
the bacteria got into the scratches in her back.
infections radiate. That shape of this isn't
eat this. - I don't feel like eating.
it'll make you better.
a sandwich? - Magic sandwich.
there's no such thing-- - just take a damn bite, okay, kid?
amazing how she didn't go into anaphylactic shock.
that's diagnostical lyridiculous.
right, she's allergic to everything except peanuts.
if she is allergic, antibiotics could cause a massive systemic reaction.
if she's allergic, but she's not.
chase, you're right.
the shape indicates allergy. The tests indicate allergy.
just because she's not allergic to peanuts doesn't mean she's not allergic to lidocane or
chase, hang the bag!
you can growa backbone tomorrow.
no, I'm not giving my daughter drugs that could shuther system down.
you know what else shuts down systems? Death.
sorry. I can't let you do this.
luckily, Alice Hartmann has a mom who is willing to see reason.
you were in here yesterday telling me her father's guardianship was best for her.
I honestly figured I'd get a different judge today.
you agree with Dr. House now.
now my kidactually is sick. - She was sick yesterday.
her pediatrician doesn't know what's wrong with her, says Dr. House is the best.
she loses guardianship. All of a sudden, House is a hero.
it's got nothing to dowith me deciding
Hey, zip it! I've heard enough.
this lawyering thing is easy. - You shut up too.
arguing over every decision is a waste of her time and mine.
since her parents can'tor won't agree,
I'm awarding temporaryguardianship to a doctor who will place the health of the child above all else.
I don't think dr. Houseis capable
Dr. Cuddy. - Yes, your honor.
no, I was finishingmy sentence.
the kid's all yours.
3: 00. Give me the pills.
I don't even know this kid. How am I supposed to decide what's best for her?
fine, I'll choose.
I'm gonna side with the angry doctor's opinion. Give me my pills.
we're not gonna gobroad-spectrum.
if there's any chancethat she's allergic
there is no chance. - Of course there's a chance.
I'm appealing. - No, you're not.
if you think it's bacterial, pick one antibiotic.
not gonna be enough. We need to go broad-spectrum.
it kills bugs. That's what you want.
we'll go with metronidazole.
you don't have to testify he's broken any laws.
though i'm sure you could.
just how many pills he takes in a day.
because I'm fairly confident I can prove that didn't, uh, have that many legitimate prescriptions.
I really hope no one dies while I'm sitting here not talking to you.
I--I had a, uh--I had a buddy at trenton pddo some digging.
your brother locked up for drugs.
your own flesh and blood, and you don't even visit.
but your boss practices medicine on drugs, time to start lying to the cops.
if I run out for coffee, will I get back before you make your point?
you, um, you testify...
I can make sure that Marcus goes free on parole in less than two months.
my brother and I...
we grew up in the same home.
but... I made something of myself.
he didn't.
Dr. Foreman, the way you talk, you'd think you never committed any crimes yourself.
you and Dr. House. You are both cold bastards.
you don't give a damn about your brother, and you can't stand House.
but I do expect you to take this deal because you hate hypocrisy more.
house has had a thousand chances. You had two chances.
why is your brother stuck at one?
well, if she was allergic to this antibiotic, we would've seen it by now.
I think we are out of the woods as far as that goes.
guess they occasionally get one right.
you're gonna be glib about this?
you almost killed her. - I made a choice.
the same choice you made yesterday. Only when I make it, I'm an imbecile.
every decision you have made has been wrong.
when this over, I'm suing for sole custody.
because I trusted doctors when you didn't?
because it's not just about the past two days.
like you have the hotline on what's best for Alice. She loves me.
she never does her homework when she's with you. She never brushes her hair
her heart's racing. Pressure's rising. The two of you, get out.
I'm her mother. You can't just
you fight. She has an anxiety attack.
the two of you are making her worse. Get out and don't come back.
how's the kid doing?
much better as of about two hours ago. You got any moneyfor lunch?
if you like parsley and croutons.
Tritter finally froze my accounts. - Really?
you surprised? Why wouldn't he?
well, I figured if he wassingling you out, you must've done something different.
what, like talking?
Yeah, and now that he's frozen your accounts, you probably will. You need the cash, right?
he doesn't freeze my accounts, I'm guilty. He does freeze my accounts, I'm guilty.
is Alice having some procedure done?
she's fine. She's resting. - Where?
in her room, where you're not supposed to
I was just at the window. There's no one in there.
her backpack wasn't there either.
you don't think her father could've
call security.
get a gurney. - She's stiff. She can't move.
I don't know what happened. I mean, she seemed fine.
help her, please.
on the plus side, she could medal in luge.
muscle rigidity is almost exclusively neurological.
Neuroaxonal dystrophy. She's the right age.
except that her liver's starting to shut down.
no dystrophy would-- - metronidazole. Great idea.
let's not go broad-spectrum. Let's not take any chances of actually curing her.
house, can you focus on the case? - No! Because I'm in pain.
because you think that compromise is the answer to everything.
I need more pills.
muscle rigidity plus liver involvement means Wilson'S.
no, no corneal ring. No mental changes.
then what?
I need more pills! - No, you are ona reasonable
what the hell does"reasonable" mean?
keep it quiet. Her B. P.Reacts to stress, and yelling is not
if you think that I'm not in pain, then don't give me anything.
keep me away from the aspirin.
but if I'm ina buttload of pain, I need a buttload of pills.
fine. You need more pills. You're not getting them.
you can have all the aspirin you want.
I say we draw straws. Loser drives down to trenton, scores him an eight-ball.
which one of you twogave her an aspirin? - What?
her symptomsfit reye's syndrome, which doesn't make any senseunless she took aspirin.
rob? - No way. She's a kid.
I've read the 800warning labels.
I'm not even angry. I just want her to be okay.
she's lying. She's angry. Because you kidnapped her kid.
she'll be angrier if the kid dies. - I didn't.
one aspirin combined with a pre-existing infection is all it takes to set off an attack.
I'm not lying.
well, sure, you've certainly earned our trust.
where was Alice the night before she came in?
with me. Well, at my House.
I went out. She stayed with a babysitter.
where were you? - None of your business.
you hired someone that might've poisoned our daughter.
she's 15. She's very responsible.
is she a 15-year-old pharmacist?
or just some kid from down the street who needed 20 bucks for lip gloss and coupleof tiger beats?
put your kid oncharcoal hemoperfusion.
shouldn't we see what the babysitter has to say?
I know what she's gonna say. She's gonna lie to save her business.
I need more pills.
we are gonna use this machine to clean your blood.
it goes out of you and through a filter like the filter in a fish tank.
it's kind of coolactually.
I'm scared.
it won't hurt.
it takes a while, so it'll be boring. But it won't hurt.
it's gonna makeyou better.
they hate each other, don't they? We're never gonna be together again.
well, you never know.
you gonna break out the rubber hoses, the bright lights?
I'm not gonna testify just because I have to borrow lunch money.
I know. Women don't give up guys that they're in love with.
I'm not in love with House.
the guy is unhinged and unethical.
does what he wants with no concern for others.
but you stand by him.
it can't just be loyalty and respect. - No.
I'm girl, so i must be in love with him.
not because you're a girl.
because ten years ago you got an "a" in calculus until you ratted yourself out.
showed your professor a mistake he missed.
because you marrieda man-- - don't go there.
you used to be someone who did the right thing.
house has changed you do you think it's all been for the better?
how's it going? - Boring.
told you. - So far, so good.
just like five minutes ago, ten minutes before that.
what's the matter?
she must've thrown a clot.
let's get her out of here. I'll call the O. R.
you said it wouldn't hurt!
found it. - She's burning up.
give me a sec. - Foreman, she is on fire.
almost there.
get me some cooling blankets now. - Right away.
every time we touch this kid, something goes wrong.
bad mojo is not a diagnosis.
you really had to flash your private stash in front of me?
you find it easier to lie for me if it's more subtle?
fine.
your told your associates thatI had frozen your accounts.
Yes. - Smart lie.
you figured they'd think there was a reason that you'd been singled out.
like that you had agreed to testify against House.
Yeah, I assume that's why you did it.
you have a reputationas a bit of an opportunist.
you already gave your boss up once from what I've heard.
to save my job. He goes down now, I lose my job.
you lose your job, you find another one.
you get fired...
chances don't look so hot.
why would he fire to me? - Because you rolled on him.
I haven't rolled on him. - I think you will.
and he's gonna think you already did.
as far as he knows, my accounts are frozen just like everyone else's.
in 24 hours, all three of you will have access to your accounts again.
why would you
see, I was looking at this as an outsider, I would say it was because detective Tritter had what appeared to be a very pleasant lunch with Dr. Chase.
Yeah.
the two of them appeared to be working together.
how the hell are there no ice packs in the O. R?
clot's out. Ice packs aren't going to hold her for long. Where are the blankets?
in the E. R. They're dealing with a four-car collision.
we need to coo lthis kid downbefore her brain melts.
what are you doing?
she got a major dose of heparin to thin her blood for the procedure.
could've induced thrombocytopenia.
that's unlikely. The charcoal would've absorbeda lot of the heparin.
she's been anemic. Could be a primary blood disorder.
or we never cured the infection. - Are you saying she never had reye's?
we just put that little girl through excruciating pain.
the pain wasn't House's fault.
even if the clot wasa reaction to what we gave her we still had
I don't need you to covermy ass!
what I need is my vicodin!
two pills every six hours. Like I'm on an allowance.
she's a given a cop leverage over medical decisions.
what the hell? Why don't we get a plumberin here, ask his opinion?
Hey, Cuddy, you know any rodeo clowns who can weigh in
where the hell is she?
look at her arm.
I told you it was an infection.
we fixed the infection. - Well, apparently not.
I asked you for broad-spectrum. You put her on the bare minimum.
it's a good thing you failed to become a mom because you suck at it.
what's good about this rash?
good guesses, but no.
it's on parts of her body that we haven't touched.
she's got a fever of 103. She's in and out of consciousness.
but it's not a reaction to anything we did.
her mojois off the table. Which means?
Oh, so close!
means that thanks to cuddy's candy-ass approach broad-spectrum antibioticsare no longer an option.
this thing has grown horns and fangs.
we gotta figure out what species it is.
go in with a spear to the heart.
okay, you guys are sulking.
I don't really care why, but apparently I can't do my job without finding out.
Tritter released our bank accounts. - Horrible, horrible news.
wow, I'm glad we didn't let that fester.
if she did have reye's, then it could be varicella. They're associated.
he released our money. You do know what that means.
the correct question is"how could it be varicella given that she's not itchy"?
Rickettisal pox causesrash, fever, and muslepain. - Pain, not paralysis.
rocky mountain spotted fever on the other hand. Rash, fever, anemia, paralysis.
and I didn't sayanything to tritter. - Neither did I.
maybe he wants us to think that one of us talked.
it worked. - You were with him.
we were all with him. - We weren't laughing with him.
maybe he just gave up.
start the kid on chloramphenicol for rocky mountain spotted fever.
can we talk? - Nope.
I really thinkeither you screwed meand you want absolution, or you didn't and you want applause.
either way I'm not interested.
busy.
you okay? - Yeah, sure.
what I meant by"are you okay"? Is what the hell did House do?
nothing. - What did he say?
I've seen House be rude a thousand times, usually to achieve something.
I have never seen him be mean just because he can.
Seriously?
what did he say? - Nothing. Doesn't matter.
well, I've seen House be rude to you a thousand times, but I've never seen it get to you.
people think House has no inner censor.
but the fact is he holds himself back, because when he wants to hurt, he knows just where to poke a sharp stick.
I have been trying to get pregnant, and House knew.
he told me I wouldf ail as a mother.
and you're this upset because you think he's right?
I've had three separate implantations.
the first two never took. The last one I lost.
I'm sorry. You didn't fail. Those where physical events.
a little girl is... scared and in pain.
I was awkward, terrified of doing the wrong thing.
that's normal. That's
I didn't hug her.
I didn't even reach outand hold her hand.
I told her it was gonna be okay.
she needed reassurance.
I told her her folks might get back together.
when I see people with their kids, it's so natural.
it's like they have an instruction book imprinted on their genes.
maybe I just didn'tget a copy.
maybe my wanting to be a motheris like a tone deaf person wanting to sing opera - or a paraplegicwho wants to-- - whoa, whoa, whoa.
well, I see what you mean about House pokingin the right spot.
chloramphenicol isn't working.
what dose did you give her? - Yeah, maybe Chase screwed up.
we always end up there. Just getting a jump on it.
I doubled her up.
the infection's morphed.
it's moved into her muscle sheath. - Necrotizing faciitis?
that's impervious to drugs.
the only treatment... is to cut away the infected area.
so we amputate. - Arm and leg?
we can't cut a six-year-old kid in half without a confirmed diagnosis.
moves too quicklyand we waited too long. We don't have timefor a culture.
we can at least observe herfor a few hours. Confirm the rashis spreading.
it spreads, she dies.
you're talking about crippling her.
we're not even certain this was an infection.
right! She's six! She's cute! She can't have flesh-eating bacteria!
it's just wrong! Let's cure her with sunshine and puppies.
cute kids die of illnesses. Innocent doctors go to jail.
and it because cowards like you won't stand up and do what's required.
you can sit around and moan about who's the bigger weakling.
I'm gonna go do my job.
what kind of quality of life will she have without
great thing about life.
it's got qualities.
and if we can't agree?
I don't know.
he's yelled at us before.
because he thought our theories were dumb. Not because our theories were sending him to jail.
he's going through withdrawal. Could be causing mild paranoia.
it'll pass, we just have to suffer thought.
we never ruled out allergy.
we gave her drugs. She had no negative reaction.
we cut open her belly. She got a rash on her belly.
we did a scratch teston her back. She got a rash on her back.
I know House ruled out mojo, but it can't be a coincidence
too late to be playing differential games, isn't it?
get that thing away from me. I don't want to get burned.
laser pointers don't burn you, genius.
skin, no. Retina, yes.
you don't trust my aim?
maybe you should cover any sensitive
he was wrong about the puppies.
house, you gotta stop the surgery.
she doesn't have necrotizing faciitis. - Oh, good.
she's got erythropoieticprotoporphyria. She's allergic to light.
it's genetic, either parent could've carried it.
I know what it is. Infection fits better.
she gets worse every time she goes under surgical lights.
dad takes her outside-- - liver's shot too.
she swallow a flashlight? - Stop the surgery.
get the hell out of my way. - No, I'm--unh!
light damagesthe blood cells.
the damaged blood cells contain protoporphyrin.
the protoporphyrinbuilds up in the liver.
that's why the liver'sshutting down.
stop.
how can she be allergic to light? She's never had thisproblem before.
the negative reactionstarts at birth.
it reaches critical massaround this age.
her blood cells create chemicals in reaction to light.
when they reach the liver, it tries to filter out the bad cells.
the chemicals damage the liver, and one byproductis gallstones.
so she'll just keep getting worse?
EP can be managed. We'll give her beta-carotene.
she's gonna need special light bulbs and filters on the windows.
she's probably gonna need to be home schooled.
her life will becomplicated, but she will live.
how do you getsomething like this?
it's genetic. So one of us...
both of youmust be carriers.
she's gonna want to see you when she wakes up. So...
don't screw it up.
so, what's new?
house missed one. - That's happened before.
he nearly maimed a little girl. I got it right.
and I told him, and it didn't matter.
chase, you solved one. You helped a patient. That better be enough for you.
Beckett was gonna call his play"waiting for House's approval"but decided it was too grim.
trust me. I'm not waiting anymore.
I'm gonna need 30 pieces of silver.
well if my old man find something about biking with you he'll kill us both.
Oh, yeah? If your old man was a man, I might be worried.
Wayne, you got to get me back, I'm serious.
I'll get you a ride.
what if he doesn't stop?
Oh, he'll stop.
Hey!
stop!
you stupid bastard!
when I get through with you you're going to wish...
you were dead!
he's dead.
massive internal bleeding in the abdominal cavity, Gerald.
that's enough.
my young friend, you must have been in acute pain for many hours.
what kept you from seeking help, I wonder?
run the gut for me, would you, please, Gerald?
not a problem.
it's definitely a blockage.
it's strange, through. It seems to consist of a cluster of objects.
gallstones?
Oh, my, no.
gallstones that large could never pass through the cystic duct.
and even if they did, they wouldn't all be expelled at the same time.
although I did find a gallbladder once with almost a kilo of large stones.
of course, the victim was a sumo wrestler who weighed over 200 kilos.
he was in the middle of a bout. He just went
they're stones, doc.
not gallstones.
emeralds.
it was lodged in his gastrointestinal tract causing perforation of the peritoneum, internal bleeding, infection and death.
he swallowed emeralds. - He did, indeed.
I'm going to take a wild guess here, doc.
he smuggled them into the country.
it's from where he smuggled them in, Jethro.
our sailor just arrived from Guantanamo bay, Cuba, where he was a translator.
petty officer second class Khalil sa'id, naturalized american citizen, born in Egypt.
worked as a translator at camp Delta, fluent in arabic, uyghur, pashtu.
died in his car on route 522 near Fredricksburg.
almost killed a pair of bikers.
vroom-vroom bikers or pedal bikers?
I said bikers, Tony, not cyclists.
bikers is a term that refers to both cyclists...
next of kin? / None in the states. No U. S. Address, either.
and apparently he rotated from our naval station in Bahrain to Gitmo five months ago.
Where'd he get those emeralds?
Gitmo exchange?
sorry.
get your gear. We're going to Gitmo.
that's a good one, boss.
he was kidding, right?
I don't think so.
we're going to cuba! Ha-ha!
Hey, Gibbs.
I've got a gemologist coming over to look at the rocks.
he's my mother's friend's sister's son.
does he know his stuff? - I went out with him, like, once.
didn't get very far.
this all from the car?
Yeah.
it was a rental.
any classified material? - Not in the suitcases.
they could've swapped his hard drive before he left.
check it, anyway.
these were in the suitcase.
stamped, no postmark.
all the same return address.
NCIS special agent Paula cassidy.
you know her? - No, but I will.
okay, smell this.
do those turn you on, Abby?
turned somebody on.
box of condoms, half empty.
the price tag says they'refrom the Gitmo exchange.
Hey, maybe it was a package deal.
see if you can brand the cologne.
why, you want some?
Nope, don't use cologne.
the women I date think the smell of sawdust is sexy.
that's why I don't date many women.
Oh!
sorry.
you had better have a good reason for spilling my coffee.
I do.
I booked us on the first AMC flight to Gitmo tomorrow.
Unbook it.
I knew it.
I told Kate you were pulling my leg.
the navy's giving us a priority ride today.
you mean it?
you do mean it.
normally, I hate priority rides, but who cares if it's going...?
what's wrong with priority rides? - Come on, boss.
tell me you like sitting on canvas seats slung between cargo pallets.
Yeah, it makes me feel like I'm back in the corps.
I love priority rides.
boss, this is the best.
I miss canvas seats.
check this out.
what do you want?
get to work. - I already started.
Guantanamo enjoys a year-round tropical climate, cooled by the breezes from the windward passage.
some of the more popular pastimes include skin diving, sunbathing and horseback riding.
I would be the last one to rain on your parade, Fidel, but you're logged onto an official navy web site.
it's PR.
this isn't.
it's the NCIS file on special agent Paula cassidy.
she's an interrogator at camp Delta.
special agent Cassidy is not to know that Sa'id is dead.
we're not working with her?
Sa'id was carrying five unmailed letters of hers.
until we find out how she was involved with him, she's out of the loop.
I can't believe we're in a $40-million gulfstream.
I mean, it's got to be CNO's or SECNAV's.
you know, Tiger woods has one of these.
Tom cruise, all the big movie stars. This is their ride.
Yeah, boss? - Can we get to work?
sure thing. Just...
check this out.
it's a gulfstream.
so much for the element of surprise.
welcome to Gitmo.
I'm special agent Paula cassidy.
special agent Jethro gibbs.
special agent Kate todd, / Hi. how are you?
special agent Anthony dinozzo Hey. / Hello.
I heard you all were coming.
nice ride.
you are so right there.
this is yours.
there's a map in it.
they've put you up in one of the nicest houses on the base.
we appreciate that, special agent Cassidy.
so is there something going down that I should know about?
no.
it's just that all my transcripts have been pulled, my interrogations have been canceled, and then you all arrive on a navy gulfstream.
how would you connect the dots?
I wouldn't.
okay.
enjoy your stay.
okay.
we'll set up here.
tomorrow morning, we'll be joined by the senior FBI translator, covering transcripts of Sa'id's translations.
the interrogator...
special agent Cassidy.
no way!
it's the only bedroom with a bath.
I know, and I picked it first.
women take baths, men take showers, Tony.
why does the woman thing come up when a ship is sinking or when there's only one bedroom with a bath?
Gibbs. / Well, you were right about Sa'id's laptop.
his system's a virgin.
well, we'll track down the hard drive he had here and ship it to you.
when is your rock boy coming?
in the morning.
my mother's very excited.
find anything else? - Yeah, I picked up another scent on his shorts and his T-shirts.
what did Sa'id do, bathe in the stuff?
no, it's not his.
it's peach and musk with vanilla as a top note.
it'd definitely feminine.
well, tag it.
perfume is expensive, Gibbs.
I can't just hang out at the macy's tester tray with my lab kit.
they frown on that sort of behavior.
buy what you need to, Abby. We'll deal with it later.
bold, Gibbs, bold.
we're finished. - And we need to talk to you.
whatever. It'll have to wait till the morning.
it's kind of important.
appreciate that.
I'm going to bed.
talk to you manana.
any preference on the remaining bedrooms?
no. They're both equally crappy.
you pick. - Ladies first.
night.
God!
Halt!
I need coffee.
Where'd you get this, Abby?
if I told you, I'd have to kill you, Benjamin.
this is very sweet, but you did not have to bring me a gift.
well, I wanted to.
and your mother said it was something you could use.
Oh, right on. Thanks.
Benjamin, this is great.
so, the emerald, is it real?
Oh, it's very real.
color grade 2. 5,
tone one to two, clarity I-one.
it's at least worth $20, 000.
and the color's quite distinct.
it's bluish-apple green.
and the fluid inclusions are quite different than colombian stones.
this emerald was mined in the Panshir valley.
Where's that?
afghanistan.
bill. Senior translator, camp Delta.
we've been expecting you. Special agent Gibbs, special agents Dinozzo and Todd.
when the fbi relaxes their dress code, they sure go for it.
these are the transcripts of the interrogations of Nasser al jazair you requested.
the translator was Sa'id?
that's right. Apparently there's a problem?
did you know him? - Only to say hello.
he worked with your interrogator, Paula cassidy.
you might want to think about keeping that door shut.
iguanas have been known to wander inside.
Nasser arrived in june from Afghanistan.
Yes. Insists he was picked up by mistake.
ha. weren't they all.
agent Cassidy did especially well with the subject.
younger detainees feel more comfortable with female interrogators.
once rapport's been established, prisoner is only interrogated by that team.
I understand agent Cassidy's not in the loop on this?
correct.
I booked you an interrogation room for this afternoon.
we'd better get started.
okay, I want to know more about agent Cassidy.
who her friends are in Gitmo. How she spends her free time.
where she hangs out.
is she involved with Sa'id.
sure. / No problem.
did I say both of you?
well, you didn't not say both of us, Gibbs.
Yes, she's kind of got a point there, boss.
well, I'm saying it now.
DiNozzo, you go.
Kate will stay here and help me with this.
got it.
do you mind telling me why he...? - Yeah.
agent Cassidy has a lot of friends, I'll say that.
mostly male friends, and mostly either interrogators or translators.
Where's she hang?
club on base called El floridita.
check it out.
observe her if she's there.
can I drink? / Sure.
sasparilla.
sasparilla? - Who drinks sasparilla?
who's shane?
alan ladd.
who's Alan ladd? - Maybe you should check her out, Kate.
I'm on it.
Where's agent dinozzo?
drinking sasparilla.
they'll bring Nasser down as soon as the evening prayers are finished.
why aren't you praying?
I'm presbyterian.
how do you say good cop, bad cop in arabic?
I learned my arabic at the defense language institute in monterey.
that phrase wasn't in the syllabus.
Nasser should be here in about five minutes.
watch his body language.
fortunately, Nasser speaks some english.
so, Jack palance shoots Elisha cook.
the slug lifts his body off the ground, and splat, right into the mud.
you ever seen the maltese falcon?
Nope. / Oh, you young people don't know what good movies are.
all this violence today, so sad.
splat isn't violent?
what are you drinking?
sarsaparilla.
root beer.
so you're on duty? - Maybe I just like sarsaparilla.
Cosmo, Jimmy.
coming up.
that's funny. I knew you were going to order a cosmo.
are you here to check me out?
define checking out.
come on, what are you doing here?
straight up?
no, I.I want you to lie to me.
you turn me on.
here, let me pay. - No, thanks.
I buy my own drinks.
so, Jack palance shoots Elijah wood?
he asks who we are.
name is Gibbs.
u. S. Naval criminal investigative service.
sit down.
where is Paula?
she's been replaced...
by me.
Why?
I think you know why.
no.
well, sit down, Nasser. I'll tell you why.
Sa'id is dead.
he's praying.
thank you.
miss me?
like herpes.
that confuses me.
Really? / Absolutely.
if you don't like me, then why do you keep coming over here for refills?
I like the game.
me, too.
your move.
you've been here eight months, and you haven't hooked up.
well, how do you know?
you danced with five different guys. Nothing going on with any of them.
you're counting the men that I'm dancing with?
I'm the jealous type.
huh. Jimmy, does he seem like the jealous type?
I thought so...
see? / Till he flashed his badge when I wouldn't answer any questions about you.
more info than she needed, Jimmy.
Oh, I'm disappointed.
what if I told you I was checking out the competition?
I'd say you were lying. - No, it's true.
I'm checking out the competition.
for your investigation.
and for me.
so, what are you going to write in your report?
that you have rules about hooking up with men you work with.
accurate?
incomplete.
I have rules about guys that investigate me, too.
never broken a rule?
have you?
if the risk is worth it.
Jimmy, un tequila y una cerveza, por favor.
let's dance.
Sa'id was a good man.
he gave me hope I would see my family again.
he said america does not hate islam...
that Allah knows we are here.
don't you want to know how he died?
or have you guessed? - He guessed.
how would I know?
we have no contact here with the outside world.
he swallowed these.
they killed him.
think he got them from you.
I don't understand.
says he's never seem them before.
he'd like to return to his cell, so he can pray for his friend's soul.
tell him he's not going back to his cell.
he's being transferred to isolation.
he says he was promised a transfer to minimum security.
who promised him that?
special agent Cassidy.
one second.
back at the house...
be there in five.
I'm back on duty.
well, that's too bad.
so are you.
why'd you recommend transferring Nasser to minimum security?
reward for cooperation.
that's the idea around here. - We read the transcripts.
he didn't tell us anything we didn't know.
well, that's not the point. He told us all that he knows.
are you sure?
it's a judgment call, but we get a lot of flack around here for holding people too long.
are you going to tell me what's going on?
are you going to tell us what was going on between you and Sa'id?
we worked together.
that's all.
these were found in Sa'id's luggage.
well, he was going to put them in the mail for me.
couldn't find the post office?
mail is slow out of Gitmo.
Sa'id was on his way to the states, and I asked him to throw them in the mail for me.
you mind of we open them? - Yes, I mind.
they're private. - We'll get a court order.
what the hell is this about?
why do you have these letters?
something happen to Sa'id?
he's dead.
Oh, my god.
how? what happened?
tell me how he died.
internal bleeding from a perforated bowel caused by the presence of hard objects in his intestines. / Hard objects, what the hell is that supposed to mean?
look...
I have been a damn good NCIS agent for over six years now.
I really don't deserve to be treated like this.
all we asked is, can we open these letters?
sure, go ahead. Open the damn things.
thank you.
they're to my family. Would you like to...
search my apartment while you're at it? / I will.
okay.
sorry, Paula.
check out Sa'id's apartment, too.
first time I've seen you apologize to a suspect.
how would you feel if I was going to search your apartment?
violated beyond belief.
you know why you're attracted to her, though, don't you? / Who said I was?
it's endorphins. - Well, thank you, Abby.
Oh, you were so excited about going to cuba and riding in the jet.
it stimulated the hell out of your endorphins.
the first woman you saw was like honey to a bear.
you were the first woman I saw on my endorphin high.
Yeah, well, we work together, Tony. It's like a brother-sister thing.
never had a sister.
that's probably a good thing. - You just passed Sa'id's room, sis.
need some help?
no.
Tony, wait.
Sa'id had a key to her apartment.
well, she doesn't have a key to his.
women like making love in their own bed.
now, wait a minute, just 'cause you're a woman and you enjoy doing it in your own bed. / you're right, I misspoke.
does not mean that all women - I was wrong, Tony.
insist on doing it in their own bed. - Let it go.
going to read me my rights?
you have the right to be reimbursed for postage.
put it on your expense report.
Thanks.
you might want to take that chip off your shoulder.
gladly.
just treat me as a member of the team.
we're in the same agency, not on the same team.
is this interrogation over?
Yeah. Yeah, almost. Uh...
why is special agent Dinozzo sorry?
he blew his chance to get laid.
this just came for you from Guantanamo bay.
it's Sa'id's hard drive.
excellent.
Ah...
quite a collection.
Yeah, I'm trying to match a scent I found on Sa'id's clothes.
I don't see chanel number five.
does anyone wear that anymore?
my mother does.
Really?
ever since Marilyn monroe confessed that chanel number five was all she wore to bed.
so, does your mother...?
unfortunately, yes.
makes for terribly awkward slumber parties.
Nasser is extremely upset.
feels he's been cooperative and now he's in a cell with no windows.
well, maybe after losing all this luxury, he'll be even more cooperative.
a psychiatrist examined him and is worried for his mental health.
I'm not all that interested in the mental health of people who want to kill me.
you certain Nasser's a terrorist?
isn't it possible he is what he says he is.
a man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time?
Yeah, and it's also possible that he's the man who gave Sa'id those emeralds.
why would he do that?
are you that naive?
or did Nasser pass some of those emeralds on to you?
what are all these bottles, Abby?
that's the perfume you said I could buy.
did we have to buy so many?
I only got 30.
there's more than 2, 500 on the market.
you're kidding me.
perfume is the most powerful accessory a woman can wear.
Yeah, well, how much did all this power cost us?
around $1, 500.
$1, 500?
well, that's not including the tax.
I stuck to the 30 most popular scents, hoping we'd get lucky.
Ah...
how fiscally responsible, Ab.
thank you. / So, we get any bang for our 1, 500 bucks?
we did.
the perfume on Sa'id's clothes is called escada.
never heard of it.
you wanna hear about his hard drive?
what's it going to cost me?
it's pretty much synonymous with his sex drive.
our boy deleted 20 gigs of porn before he turned his drive in.
he was trading with a porn pal on a hotmail account that doesn't exist anymore.
anything good on it?
nothing with sawdust yet.
agent Cassidy's?
Yeah. Uh...
nothing else of interest in her apartment, except...
what?
she had a bottle of escada on her dresser, and Sa'id had a key to her apartment, but she did not have a key to his.
most women prefer their own beds.
so, she and Sa'id were doing the horizontal salsa.
not according to the bartender at El floridita.
what, lovers register with him at Gitmo first?
bartenders know this kind of stuff, boss.
he said she went there most nights, danced with a lot of guys, but...
always went home alone.
What'd you find out, Kate?
Sa'id's place wasn't just clean, it was sterilized.
there were some towels, soap and a half a roll of toilet paper.
I think Sa'id copied Paula's key without her knowing it.
now, which brain is thinking that, Dinozzo?
I'm hitting the rack.
get this off to Abby first thing in the morning.
you know, Gibbs, - sometimes you can be a real... - bastard?
Yes.
Yeah, well, my gut is telling me agent Cassidy's telling the truth.
so, then, what's the problem?
romance between agents, Kate...
it never works.
you speaking from experience?
Sa'id and I were not lovers.
who told you that?
room key.
had yours on his key chain.
that's not possible.
how would he get my room key?
you gave it to him.
no, I didn't.
I lost a key.
had to replace one.
Sa'id could've stolen it.
are you just remembering now that you lost a key?
I was just told that somebody else had it.
okay.
okay, let's say that I buy that.
why would he want a key to your room?
to get to my computer.
but how does he get my password?
if you don't keep your doors shut, the iguanas get in.
we did so many interrogations together...
he could've watched me type it in.
why would Sa'id want to get into your computer?
to read my interrogation reports.
I don't know.
lately, I noticed that his conversations with Nasser seemed longer than his translations.
I even noted that in my computer.
Sa'id... took leave and left the next day for the states, right after I wrote that.
his room was empty. He wasn't intending to come back.
I should've had bill come and sit in on one of the interrogations and check my suspicions.
I blew it.
these are the hard objects that Sa'id had in his stomach when he died.
emeralds?
I think he got them from Nasser.
but how did Nasser get them past our body search?
Nasser complained of constipation when he arrived, and they gave him a laxative.
he got them in the same way Sa'id got them out.
what are you looking at, Abby?
it's just sex, Ducky.
just sex?
Yeah.
you know, biological act between creatures within a species in response to neurological and physiological stimuli.
between creatures within their species?
usually.
this isn't yours, I hope.
no.
it's off Sa'id's hard drive.
but something's wrong.
the files are too big.
not just the files.
Easter eggs.
what the hell are easter eggs?
Easter eggs are hidden messages within a computer program.
if you don't know to look, you don't know they're there.
they were hidden in the porn?
my cursor has moved across places that would make Tony blush.
what kind of messages?
there's a diagram of the camp, and a bunch of stuff in arabic.
it's coming to you now.
something tells me it's not a greeting from the bunny.
Sa'id arrived Gitmo april 23.
april 28, he writes,
son-in-law located.
may 11,
son-in-law moved to minimum security.
may 23, he gets a response.
leader disavows son-in-law.
he will be eliminated by the one who is victorious.
leader?
bin laden.
my god, we've got one of Bin laden's son-in-laws here and didn't know it.
the one who is victorious?
why does he start talking in riddles all of a sudden?
I don't think he is.
I may not be translating that accurately.
it's old arabic for the one who is victorious.
I, uh, owe you an apology, Gibbs.
if I transferred Nasser into minimum security...
you didn't. Don't worry about it.
how do we find this son-in-law?
easy.
we transfer Nasser to minimum security so he can kill him.
in camp Delta, the security buck stops with me.
if Nasser kills a detainee, it'll be my ass.
yeah...
but once the son-in-law learns that Bin laden ordered him murdered, he's going to sing like a bird in islamic paradise, and maybe that prevents another 9/11.
what's your plan, Gibbs?
we transfer Nasser to minimum security.
from isolation to minimum security? He's bound to be suspicious.
new interrogator'll have to deliver the news convincingly.
since we know he trusts women, that's me.
no, that's me.
I'm the one he trusts.
you promised him minimum security. He got isolation.
he won't believe you have the authority to move him.
he will when I order the guards to remove the shackles.
that's too risky. - Tony's right.
Nasser and Sa'id did this right in front of me.
you're an interrogator, not a translator.
you couldn't have known.
but I did.
I had suspicions about Sa'id, and I let them slide.
it's inexcusable.
Yep.
let me make up for it.
how good an actress are you, agent Cassidy?
ask Tony.
he bought my act.
icing me was an act?
no.
letting you think I was melting was.
Tony, she'd say anything to get in that room.
Kate, it's not a problem. We were both playing a game.
yeah...
who won?
Hello, Nasser.
I did not expect we'd meet again.
neither did I.
remove the shackles.
now, please.
where is Gibbs?
recalled to washington.
his superiors determined that his concerns were unfounded.
he's not buying it.
he will.
agent Gibbs has had problems in the past.
agent Cassidy, this isn't appropriate.
he deserves to know.
he has a history of building cases at the expense of the facts.
tell him.
she's good.
I was locked up like a dog.
it was out of my hands, Nasser. I'm sorry.
I've arranged to have you returned to your cell.
just answer one question.
do you have a conscience?
I have a moral awareness of my actions.
good.
because I've trusted you, Nasser.
I'm glad you are back.
so am I.
she's ending the session. What is she doing?
playing him.
he's asking about the transfer to minimum security you promised him.
I'll try.
we have 120 detainees in minimum security at present.
20 to a unit.
barracks 20 is the one Nasser is assigned to, and this...
that's the inside surveillance cam.
how many guards do you have inside the barracks?
two. One on each exit, front and rear.
odds are six-to-one against his target being billeted in the same barracks as him.
that means Nasser is going to have to kill his target in the exercise yard.
what does secret service think?
three sharp shooters, there, there, and one in the watchtower.
I have an idea.
it's about time.
Nasser has to change his jumpsuit - when he transfers, right? - Spanking brand-new white one, so?
so I want to add a little trim.
you're being transferred to minimum security, Nasser.
you have kept your word.
does that surprise you?
no.
don't betray my trust, Nasser.
I will not.
right there. they're bringing him out now.
talk about your own personal web-cam.
we only did enough of the search to keep it legitimate.
you think he already has a weapon?
Oh, yeah, I do. Probably a shiv.
it makes sense. Easy to conceal.
how does he make a shiv in max security?
a comb, a toothbrush, something innocuous ground to a point.
you're good.
bet you could've made it in hollywood.
I don't know if I'm hoping you're right or wrong about Nasser.
he's a killer.
it's in his eyes. / Yeah...
the eyes always give you away.
Oh, yeah.
your target is the fifth detainee to exit.
acknowledge when you have him in your sights.
Roger that.
okay, I've got him.
that's a diversion.
lost target. Repeat, no shot.
My.my sniper's lost his target.
he's heading in the opposite direction. He switched groups.
he's going into barracks 21.
he's made his man.
where are your guards, colonel?
NCIS, open it up!
DiNozzo, go around back!
got it!
go!
get down!
I'd have killed him.
and make him a martyr?
no.
this is worse than death.
she looks awfully lonely back there.
so?
so... I think one of us should go and keep her company.
Why?
she is one of us.
what?
well, I can't let her ride alone.
why is it that women always want to fix what doesn't need fixing?
makes us feel all warm inside.
so does scotch, but it doesn't cost you a house.
I didn't really think... - I didn't think that...
you go.
watch this.
it's a gulfstream.
tell us a little bit about yourself.
um, I'm 14.
I like to run.
and... I love Beyoncé
you have a boyfriend?
I don't know.
what do you mean? Come on.
do I?
Yeah. Definitely. If you want.
daddy? - Hi, Commander Rehme.
you're videotaping my daughter in a hot tub?
it's not like that. - Get out of here. Now.
Yes, sir.
you should go to bed.
Daniel, are you there?
daddy?
help me!
help! Help me!
Oh, no! No, no, no... no, no.
help me!
I mean, that really exists?
I thought that was some urban legend.
I didn't think people actually had that. - I do.
you're really afraid of clowns. - Yeah.
what kind of clowns are we talking about?
clowns like Deeks? Or clowns like, uh...
no, real clowns. Orange hair. Fat-toed shoes.
so, we bust in on some terrorists, they pop on a red nose, and you're gonna freeze up on me?
I reveal a vulnerable part of myself, and you mock me?
hell, yeah. - Well, I have chaetophobia.
fear of hair?
impressive. Gold star for the new girl. - Way to go, Nell.
I didn't see that in your "Romancing the One" profile.
how did you know that I... - I do now.
go, Deeks.
well, you'll never find it. It's an alias.
starting off the relationship with a lie?
how's that ever going to lead to true love?
are you afraid of all hair?
back hair.
shaggy back hair. On men specifically. It's...
I shouldn't have brought it up. - You really shouldn't have.
you got me out of the clown thing.
is that your, uh, porn star cover?
how did you find that? No, no, no, Deeks. Don't do this.
dentures, hoarders, prison records.
setting the bar pretty high there, huh? - Deeks.
martial arts, techno music, and first dates at the zoo.
don't most animals have hair on their backs?
that's how she faces her fears.
ladies and gentlemen, make haste.
let's move it, Charlene.
commander Jason Rehme designs and maintains the cryptographic logons
he's a computer tech.
no, no. I know this guy. Read all his stuff.
commander Jason Rehme literally holds the keys to the navy's classified kingdom in his head.
to call Jason Rehme a computer tech is to call...
lady Gaga just a singer.
still lovin' the Gaga, huh?
commander Jason Rehme is missing.
he had a department meeting at 06: 00.
he never showed.
he hasn't answered any calls, texts or e-mails.
he'd be a prime target for both domestic and international terrorists.
so as of 0600, we are compromised.
he's been missing for an hour and a half. Send me his last known whereabouts.
let's move.
detective Deeks?
I will always love the Gaga.
door's locked.
Kensi, Deeks. - Let's go.
no one here.
still warm. Someone made coffee.
coffee could have been on a timer. Bed was slept in.
no sign of a mom living in the house. He's got a daughter, though.
Amanda, 14.
guys, I found blood.
no drops. Smearing, like somebody was dragged towards the woods.
property backs up to Angeles National Forest.
blood starts here.
I found the commander.
it's my daughter's.
I upset her last night. I went looking for her.
in the woods?
she goes running on the trails in the morning.
you don't run in flip-flops.
why didn't you call the cops?
once you get in the woods, there's no cell service.
I wanted to find her quickly.
what was your fight about?
she had a boy over. It was stupid. I made him leave.
the boy's name?
Daniel something. Daniel Proffer.
her mom died?
four years ago. How did you know that?
divorcees don't normally have pictures of their ex all over the house.
I just wanted to tell her I was sorry.
you can tell her when we find her.
the, uh, forest service is calling in all the rangers,
they'll start a search.
Daniel, the boyfriend, was home in bed.
I got agents heading over to confirm.
what is it?
it says it's from Amanda, but it's not her email address.
it's a web link to a video. It's linked to my email.
Oh, God.
see if Eric can get a trace on this. - Done.
Oh, no. No.
FBI Agent Rand, Sam Hanna.
is the father secure? He shouldn't see this.
commander Rehme's outside with our agents.
play it.
three other girls have been kidnapped and left to die in boxes buried underground.
two of the girls' bodies were found, but one was never recovered.
I remember this. - You got this guy.
Yeah, we did. Two years ago. Lucas Maragos.
Maragos would send the video to the parents of the girls.
he got off on torturing their families.
can you bring our video up here?
the video we got is a dead ringer for these.
look at the killer's hands. Same blue surgical gloves.
then we have a copycat.
were these tapes released publicly?
they were used as evidence during the trial, so there was access.
what if Maragos has a partner?
there was no evidence of a partner.
but I'll go back through the files and see if any names pop up in connection with him.
I need you to hold this match. - Okay.
don't let it go out. We only got three left.
I'm going to push the top. Try to bend it open.
the FBI will take it from here. Thanks, guys.
can I talk to you?
of course.
I don't know these guys.
I'm navy, born and bred. I trust NCIS.
is there a way you can stay on this?
it's no longer our jurisdiction.
I lost my wife.
I can't lose my child. Please.
I understand. But there's nothing...
we'll see what we can do.
you want to tell me what that was all about?
Sam, talk to me.
why did you tell him that?
because that's what I'm going to do.
I want to stay on the abduction case.
it doesn't fall within our purview, Mr. Hanna.
I think it does.
because copycat.
while the FBI is running around looking for a killer,
that's an interesting theory.
I'm taking a leave of absence.
that's very dramatic.
Sam, please don't turn your back on me.
I would never do that to you.
find her.
the Angeles National Forest is close to 650, 000 acres.
if Amanda is buried somewhere in there, finding her is going to be next to impossible.
what about infrared off a satellite?
if she's buried, her body temperature is dropping.
it's not going to work.
what's this?
equestrian center. There are horse trails here.
uh, there's a kids' camp here, only open in the summer.
can you bring up the kidnapper's video again?
Yeah.
these are three FBI videos and Amanda's.
the M. O. is really consistent.
the same camera angle, same size boxes.
same blue surgical gloves.
searching the nearest surveillance cams, we got a black '09 Chevy Malibu possibly headed from the park at 4: 30 a. m.
can't see the driver.
no plates. Somebody's hiding something.
it's got a fender bender on the rear driver's side.
09 is new. You'd make an insurance claim.
I got two matches in the L. A. area.
one, the insurance photos don't match.
the other looks like our car.
all right, it's leased to Galea Shipping.
they're a Greek company that operates out of the Port of L. A.
Oh, this one is assigned to the president of the company.
what is it?
the president of the company is Andre Maragos.
he's the brother of Lucas Maragos.
the guy convicted of the first three murders.
Deeks, can you get out to U. S. Penitentiary at Victorville and...
talk to Lucas Maragos, see if I can make some sense of this? Done.
now, according to FBI files, all the boxes were buried at the same depth, and the dimensions of the boxes were exactly the same.
calculating the remaining oxygen...
Amanda's got about nine hours to live.
I want a countdown on screen-- nine hours.
I want it on the big monitors with her picture.
I want everybody in the office to see it.
Eric, you get anything off the security camera?
no go, it's a closed circuit, and the alarm company indicates no recorders.
Thanks.
may I help you? - Federal agents to see Mr. Maragos.
Kensi, hang back, then see if you can find the Malibu.
nice place.
this way, please.
you men are federal agents?
Mr. Maragos, do you drive a black Malibu?
no. What is this about?
your company Galea Shipping leases a Chevy Malibu that may have been photographed near the scene of a crime.
my company leases probably close to 50 cars.
go. - Found the Malibu.
how did you get in here?
the garage was locked with an alarm.
Oh, my bad, I'm so sorry. I was looking for the ladies' room.
teeny, tiny, little bladder.
Eric matched the dent. It's the car.
you lied to a federal agent, Mr. Maragos.
is this the car Jennifer uses?
our personal assistant drives this car.
I'm sorry, I wouldn't know a Malibu from a Taurus.
I don't think I've ever even seen this car.
I park mine in the driveway.
Jennifer drives the boys to school in the morning.
my husband leaves the house before they're even up.
where was Jennifer last night?
alaska, backpacking.
Mr. Maragos, is this you and your brother?
Yes.
Oh, God.
you were in camp together?
he's, he's mentally ill, but I have no connection to him whatsoever.
one more time-- were you in camp together?
Yes.
where is this camp located?
the Angeles National Forest.
exactly where a young girl was kidnapped this morning.
is all that jewelry really necessary?
they have trust issues. - You've got ten minutes, huh?
guy buries three girls in the ground, I guess it's understandable, right?
well, they only found two girls.
Yeah, I'm actually not here to debate the details of your case.
God is in the details and so is my freedom.
another girl was kidnapped. That's a detail which means
I may not have to spend the rest my life in here.
was the M. O. the same?
exactly the same.
you got a partner on the outside?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Check my call records, my e-mail.
I did. The only phone calls you make are to your brother Andre.
so is that it?
you and your brother like killing together?
yeah? Bury the girls and then sit there giggling with each other while they suffocate to death?
I didn't kill those girls.
of course not. - No.
is there any evidence at all that points to my brother?
he could have committed all these murders.
we're related. The DNA's got to be close.
nobody checked my brother's DNA.
you and your brother went to camp together in the Angeles National Forest.
remember that?
we think the latest girl could be buried there.
I help you find her, you reopen my case.
you have nothing to do with it, sure.
when we were kids at that camp, there were feral cats that were all over the place.
Ah, the golden summers of a sociopathic youth.
I know where he buried them.
okay. Show me.
if my brother has something to do with this,
I will help you in every way I can.
a 14-year-old girl is buried alive in a box and running out of air.
does that sound familiar?
of course, but my brother's in prison.
so where were you last night?
at home with my wife.
Really? What were you doing?
I ate, exercised, took a shower...
Kensi? - Yeah.
Andre says he was home with the wife last night.
I'll see what I can do.
just wanted to say sorry for all of this.
thank you. - The boys are okay?
if you don't mind me asking, was your husband home last night?
Yes.
absolutely not.
he might be a lot of things, but Andre couldn't do something like that to a young girl.
I agree. I don't think he did it, but I don't think he was home last night either...
and I bet you'd like to know where he was.
was your husband home last night?
wait, I didn't give you my answer.
Yeah, you did.
go.
she didn't say it, but Andre didn't come home last night.
got it. - What'd you eat?
I mean, I can't remember.
your wife just gave you up, told us you weren't home last night.
I'm sorry, my mistake.
you're right, I was at work all night.
and now for those magic words:
I want a lawyer.
was anyone else with you? - Conversation over.
guys, Andre was at work.
I tracked his cell phone; it was there all night.
I don't buy it. - Yeah.
so his phone was in a drawer.
I want witnesses or camera confirmation.
okay.
Andre's lawyer is going before a judge.
he's trying to get an order of release.
we can't hold this guy forever.
Andre is a flight risk. He's got money.
he may go to a country with no reciprocity, and we'd never get him back.
let's go, I want everything monitored
phones, credit cards, everything.
why are we on this case?
the FBI is welcoming our assistance. - Hetty.
I respect Sam's privacy, I do, but I need to know what's going on.
he never said anything.
in our line of work, we're all haunted by nightmares.
stay close to your partner.
Andre was at work, but then look.
his phone and car stayed at work.
he took a company car.
but not the black Malibu. - Eric, give me Sam.
sat coms work in the woods. That's good news.
got Deeks for you. - Go.
Sam, you need to get out here now.
let's go.
any other sites?
you should ask my brother-- these are his.
you seem to be enjoying the attention. Give me the keys.
take a walk with me.
Hey, man!
where are you taking me? Where are we going?
you either tell me where there's another site, or I tell everyone how you went for my gun, and I was forced to defend myself.
Yeah.
Yeah, come to think of it, there were a few other sites Andre used to bury the animals.
show me.
that's a box.
move, move, move! - Box.
get on your knees!
come on! - Stay back.
Amanda! - Keep shoveling.
I guess we found your number three, right, Lucas?
something tells me there's not gonna be a lot of brotherly love.
then let's use it to our advantage.
you're destroying my life, you know that?
I could say the same thing.
I've just spoken with the Federal prosecutor.
if Amanda Rehme is found dead, buried underground and suffocated to death, it's gonna constitute special circumstances.
why have I been brought here?
special circumstances translates to the death penalty.
you're wasting your time with me.
I know your dark side, Andre, I know what you're capable of.
but this time you can't pin it on me, because I was in prison.
I've just gotten a court order to get a DNA sample from you and compare it to the DNA found on the bodies of the first three girls.
swab him.
you sure you got nothing to say now?
he walks you up to his last victim, and you're looking at me?
he obviously has a partner.
you weren't at work last night. Where were you?
open your mouth.
which one of them did it?
we don't know. Could be neither of them.
how long does my daughter have to live?
and don't tell me you don't know.
we estimate she has about six hours of oxygen left.
Oh, God. - We're not giving up.
Andre's lawyer just showed up. He's got an order for release.
stay with the commander. One moment.
ms. Rebecca Turman has testified that she is Mr. Maragos's mistress.
Mr. Maragos was with her last night.
in light of her testimony, the judge has granted an order of release.
let's go.
why did you leave your cell phone at work and then switch cars?
don't answer.
cause his wife tracks him on his GPS.
same with the cell phone.
you just gonna let him go?
we don't have a choice.
where are you going? - To find Amanda.
keep going?
it's too far from any road to go any further.
what happened in Bosnia?
you spoke to Hetty? Then you know.
okay.
my SEAL team was
another SEAL, Brian Dickerson, was with me.
we were taken to a mass grave filled with murdered Muslims.
turned out to be a trap set by the Serbian paramilitary.
I was beaten.
Brian was shot.
they didn't want to kill us until they interrogated us.
out in the woods, there wasn't anywhere to hide us, so they buried us... in a shallow grave...
along with the other bodies.
Brian was bleeding out.
there was nothing I could do.
try to keep pressure on it, okay?
what are you doing? - Trying to get some air.
it's work... it's working a little. Try to take a breath.
the best thing I can do for you is... is die fast.
try to take a breath.
I save you...
...you save someone else.
that's how it's supposed to work.
I said, take a breath.
you would do the same for me.
I don't know how much time passed.
I lit the last match.
glad you told me.
guys. - Go.
I just found a flight plan out of Burbank.
Andre Maragos is trying to leave the country.
tell them to stop.
air traffic control has repeatedly told the pilot not to move toward the runway.
he's just gonna go for it.
7650 Sierra Hotel, acknowledge.
you are not cleared to taxi.
you are not cleared to runway eight.
stop!
he's not gonna stop!
shut it down!
shut it down!
everybody out of the plane now!
I was free to leave the country.
why'd you offer the pilot a million dollars to get you to Venezuela after the tower told you to stop?
my lawyer told me that I was free to leave.
I just wanted to get out of the country until this was over.
having a brother like Lucas has destroyed my family.
I just wanted to get away.
I'm not buying it.
Sam, we've got something.
the FBI double-checked.
all DNA on the dead girls was a rock-solid match to Lucas.
there's no DNA match to Andre.
we also got proof that Andre was with his mistress last night, because they made... a little memento.
show me what you got.
that's all you get.
could've made this last year.
no. Look.
Where's my wine?
there's a date and time stamp from the news report from last night.
he was there all night.
trust me, you do not want to watch this whole tape.
Andre was all we had.
it made sense to keep looking at him.
so we got no suspects, no idea where Amanda is.
no nothing!
Hey, take a look at this.
when he picked up the camera, he pulled off the glove, changed the M. O.
that makes sense. Glove would've been shredded from all the digging.
okay, G,hear me out on this.
what does this guy do with his gloves afterwards?
well, first thing, you would, uh, burn them, shred them;
it's full of DNA.
what if he's going fast, got careless, left a glove behind, like a box or in the dirt in the hole.
case is closed. I mean, we catch him the second we find that glove.
but there is no glove.
we don't know that.
maybe neither does the killer.
he's going fast, he's scared.
he tosses everything, only to realize he left a glove behind.
right, but he... but he didn't.
but we can make him believe that he did.
exactly. - Nice.
as long as he destroyed the tape afterwards.
well, Lucas did.
like it was in the hole and got covered with dirt.
Yeah, I can do that. - Then we show it to Andre and Lucas.
I'm telling you, this is connected to those two.
we show them that there's a glove that's been left behind.
I don't know if it was them or a partner.
whoever did it's gonna get scared and go back and get it.
and we stake out the park. It's a long shot.
we're gonna need that video fast. - I'm on it.
you see that little sucker right there?
it's a glove that got left in the dirt, and it is filled with DNA.
is this really necessary?
whoever's behind this left that little glove in the dirt.
it's filled with DNA.
what's going on? - Go in the other room.
we may not find Amanda alive, but we will find her eventually.
and when we do, we'll know exactly who did this.
sorry to bother you.
guys, Kensi slipped a GPS under the bumper of the black Malibu.
it left Andre's house.
looks like it's headed towards the western part of the park.
that's us.
the car just headed onto a road that's not even on a map.
who knows the park that well?
Rangers. Hikers, campers.
what are you thinking, Eric?
can you find me some photos from Camp Wild Forest?
uh, recent photos?
guys, that Malibu stopped. - How far, Eric?
you're closing the distance. He's a half a mile away.
I spent the last two hours organizing satellite coverage.
it's overflying and coming on task... now.
I've got a heat signature. He's moving west.
you can't get it clearer than that?
satellite's still moving into position.
we're at his car. What have you got?
Eric, what are you seeing? Is he at the burial site?
we can't move until he's right on top of it.
he might be stopping. I don't know.
Eric, should we move?
come on, Eric. We're running out of time.
okay. He stopped moving just a hundred yards west of you. Go!
there are two of them. They were moving together.
what are we looking for?
that. - Of course.
Amanda went to the camp. It was right near her house.
what?
where is she?
the boys went to the same camp as their father and uncle.
they knew Amanda.
they targeted her.
where is she?!
I'll show you.
get up!
I save you...
you save someone else.
that's how it's supposed to work.
okay, okay. You're safe. You're safe.
good job.
it's for good luck.
there's your father.
Amanda. - Daddy. Oh, Daddy.
are you all right?
I'm okay.
I love you.
well, all the signs were there.
the string of dead pets in the neighborhood, school records indicating anger issues.
boys talk? - Yeah.
they said they wanted to know what killing felt like.
apparently, Uncle Lucas paid a lot of visits to them before he went to prison;
told them that if they buried the victims alive, the feeling would last for days.
wish that was the worst thing I'd ever known.
you know what really scares me?
you mean, besides clowns?
losing my partner.
I'd hug it out with you, but, uh,
I saw you sitting on some poison oak back in the woods.
trained in wilderness survival, G.
I know what poison oak looks like.
it's on my butt, isn't it?
yes it is, Mr. Hanna, and there's nothing like a good, thick slathering of calamine.
remove your pants. I won't look.
I had to do this for Ollie North in Nicaragua.
twice.
the man really was an ass.
Mr. Hanna? Mr. Callen?
gentlemen!
baby, you're worth every dollar, every nickel, every penny.
I'm begging you, shut up.
so...
michael Jones. Oxford, class of '98,
Rhodes scholar, Nobel Peace Prize winner,
time magazine's man of the year.
he ran drugs from Beach 14th to Beach 20th.
should have stayed home.
should have stayed home?
I should have stayed home.
a lot of glass.
a lot of work.
this is precisely why your mother tells you to wear clean underwear.
why does anybody need their mother to tell them that?
is everybody running around wearing dirty underwear?
help me turn him over.
it's board game money.
don't ask me why, but Smokes McGee here was counting out stacks of tens, 100s and 500s while catching up on reruns of Heckle and Jeckle.
more of a Tom and Jerry fan myself.
mighty Mouse, enough said.
that there is your murder weapon.
it was still warm when I got here.
pretty cold-blooded.
a knock on the door.
vic goes to answer.
must have been expecting someone.
but when he opens it...
game over.
looks like he had money to burn.
the marijuana joint's rolled with one of the board game bills.
only there's no board game.
this paper's too thin.
this was intentionally designed as rolling paper.
doesn't appear he was killed for the drugs.
clearly he pissed someone off.
perp did his business, didn't care about leaving the gun.
you know, four out of five doctors surveyed actually recommend smoking a doobie while having an asthma attack.
you got a name?
the apartment belongs to a Michael Jones.
this, however, is not Michael Jones.
the neighbors know him only as Scooby.
Scooby?
Dooby-Doo.
so, where is Michael Jones?
probably up at the haunted house pulling the mask off of Old Man Withers.
I'll track him down.
I know it was gonna be a late night, but I suggest coffee.
Yeah, found them in the vic's pocket.
best guess is Ecstasy.
probably dealing, based on the amount.
sounds about right.
the girls sitting with the vic said that he was the go-to guy, although they all swear they say no to drugs.
right, and they all swear they didn't see the shooter's face?
too dark and too fast.
the two sitting on this end said they saw a guy at a blue hoodie at a table over there.
they were about to do a round of drinks when...
he dropped the gun?
that's what they said.
some pill popping whack job split with the murder weapon.
how do you know the person who has it pops pills?
how do you know he doesn't?
because he's a she, and I am clean as a whistle.
who's got it on me?
nobody.
one of the girls saw it get kicked under one of the tables.
so, the night's not a total bust.
but I still have to deal with this.
perp's DNA and fingerprints could be right in front of us.
it's moments like this that I love that I'm not a lab rat.
he's got semen trace on the boxers.
I've had some bad sex, but nothing that would warrant killing the guy.
very little blood.
no spatter.
he was dumped, probably from the car that was parked right here.
so, where is our primary crime scene?
I think the car was our primary crime scene.
there's, uh, blood on the glass.
so, killed in the car and tossed on the curb.
shooter was outside the car.
look at this.
hackle marks.
now, the perpendicular end is always opposite the side of impact.
and based on the curvature of the glass, our shooter approached from the outside.
so, who took off in the car?
was it, um, the paper airplanes or-or the dancing?
it was the dancing, wasn't it?
I mean, I don't have to dance, and look, I know I say,"What up?" a lot, and I'll definitely limit the number of times that I say it, but you just need to tell me, boss, what I need to do and what I don't need to do, and I'll do it or I won't do it, you know,'cause this...
Adam, Adam, take a breath.
what are you talking about?
you-you don't know?
know what?
um... you're letting me go.
in a month. I...
I got one month left.
so, you don't... you don't happen to know anyone that's looking for a...
dedicated yet quirky yet, uh, devastatingly handsome lab geek, do you?
cause I...
this isn't about your job performance, Adam.
I knew there would be cuts.
you're just the low man on the totem pole carved by people trying to justify their jobs.
for what it's worth, sir, it, um...
it means a lot knowing that the decision didn't come from you.
you're not going anywhere.
I'll take care of this.
go back to work.
three bodies, all killed on the same night at virtually the same time.
and COD on all three is a complete mystery.
you serious?
well, they all seem to have this strange hole in their face that, prior to their being dead, didn't exist.
the bullets did them in, but they weren't concerned about living too long anyhow.
drug abuse?
you name it, it was in their systems.
Uh...ecstasy, barbiturates, cocaine, THC, meth.
this one had THC, PCP and albuterol, strangely.
we found an inhaler at the scene.
but he's not asthmatic.
his lungs are far from healthy, but no indication of asthma.
anything to chase?
well, these four marks are only a few days old.
stun gun burns.
maybe the killer graduated from stun guns to real guns.
that's a good guess.
Dr. Hammerback.
hmm, prints came back on all three.
this one had ID-- Michael Jones.
Yeah.
that was the name of the listed owner of the loft where that guy was killed.
Luther Stanton, and...this guy here
wow, he's got a great name.
you know him?
I know all three.
opening statements were supposed to begin promptly at 9: 00, people.
I see 12 jurors, I see one DA, and I see three defense attorneys, but I think we're missing some people.
care to enlighten me, Counsel?
your Honor, our clients...
I might be able to help with that, Your Honor.
detective Taylor, you know the whereabouts of the three defendants?
they're at the morgue.
all three defendants were gunned down last night around the same time at separate locations.
if we weren't looking at three different shooters,
I'd accuse you of trying to protect your undefeated record.
my case was rock solid.
well, you're damn right it was.
I collected the evidence.
even without the murder weapons, I was able to connect all three to the shooting.
it was retaliation, if you ask me.
when you kill a big player in the drug game, you've got to know people will be coming for you.
I thought these guys would plead out within a month.
here we are a year later.
must have thought they had a case.
Stanton, Labranche, and Jones were going down and they knew it.
week before trial, they tried to make a deal.
said they had good information on a pusher with a couple of bodies attached to him.
you get a name?
didn't get that far.
told them putting three drug dealing murderers back on the street in exchange for one defied logic.
what was their response to that?
they wanted to know what "defied" meant.
it's possible the guy they wanted to rat out got wind of it, decided to take them out before his name became a topic of interest.
maybe.
their statements to their attorneys are no longer privileged.
one of them might be willing to give me a name.
who's my best bet?
try Jake Donovan, Michael Jones' lawyer.
he's always been straight with me.
yo.
DNA and fingerprints?
you're a genius.
no sweat.
uh, how many more you got of these?
just five... large boxes.
awesome.
uh... just out of curiosity, what are you gonna be doing during this?
bang, bang.
I never get to play with guns.
you'll have to excuse the mess.
we just had the place fumigated.
clearly, they did a bang-up job.
but I guess it's just as well.
we come from the same species, right?
what? You don't like lawyer jokes?
I don't like lawyers.
right, and you're here because you want to give Michael Jones' eulogy or, uh, maybe you want to send flowers to the funeral.
marijuana plant would actually be more appropriate.
the DA tells me you were looking to deal?
Michael, Duckens, and Luther thought about giving up a name.
Yeah, thought about it.
Natalie Greer shot that down...
could have closed a couple more homicides maybe.
you willing to part with that name?
are you serious?
I know who you are, Mr. Donovan.
I know you represent scumbag homicidal drug dealers and the scumbag homicidal drug dealers they rat on.
I'm giving you a chance to do the right thing here.
and, uh, doing the right thing is, uh, signing my own death warrant?
what do they say about a thousand dead lawyers under the sea?
a great start?
what?
you don't like lawyer jokes?
is this how you always try to get information out of somebody?
no, usually I'm a lot less charming.
Petrix Derosier.
operates between Beach 21st and Beach 30th in Far Rockaway.
sometimes even scumbag lawyers have a heart.
just don't tell anybody.
you live by the gun, you die by the gun.
literally, my friend.
what's up?
I ran the bullets from the murder weapons recovered at the loft and the nightclub.
they were used to commit a homicide a year ago.
you got a hit to the case the vics were on trial for-- the Manny Sky case?
they were killed with the same guns that they shot Manny Sky with.
the guns were never recovered.
find the third one, two to one it was also used to kill Manny Sky.
what's the deal with your funny money?
the value of the fake dollar just went up.
check this out.
whoa, what do we got? An opiate?
oxycodone.
hundreds are laced with crystal meth and the five hundy-- PCP and albuterol -
when rolled with marijuana, provides varying degrees of an extra high.
weed isn't enough?
what's the deal with the albuterol?
it's commonly used in asthma inhalers, opens up the lungs.
adding it to PCP maximizes the intake and the hallucination.
where do they come up with this crap?
Ah...Far Rockaway.
they're called high rollers.
sold by a new crew, run by a mope named Petrix Derosier.
mac turned me on to him after he spoke to one of the vics' lawyers.
apparently, the vics were going to give Petrix up to the DA.
the funny money is his new cash cow.
what are we looking at-- a war here?
I mean, what are the vics doing with his product?
let's go ask him.
all right.
goon number one, goon number two.
how you doing there, big guy?
Hey, Petrix.
little far from Rockaway, huh?
moving on up?
well, now, if it ain't the murder police and the cleaning crew.
you boys are always nice enough to clean up after we do what we got to do.
it's just a matter of time before you're mopping up floors at Rikers, Petrix.
no doubt.
you guys are able to find a fingerprint on the tip of a needle nowadays.
something tells me you haven't quite found what you're looking for, or else I'd be wearing them shackles over there.
so, what, you want to play Red light/Green light or is there something else?
there is, as a matter of fact.
you got change of a hundred?
listen.
officers, if you needed a bump, you should have come directly to me.
I'll give you the cheap suit discount.
Oh, what happened?
watch yourself. Yeah, give us a reason.
all right, it's all right.
relax. Relax.
see, Linus and Lump over there don't have the same sense of humor I got.
apparently not.
so what you got there?
you guys doing buy-and-busts now?
Nah, I found a stack of them over at Michael Jones' place.
Luther Stanton was actually counting them out right before he took a bullet to the head.
Jones, Stanton, Labranche-- they got Beach 14 to 20, you got 21 to 30.
everything's peaceful.
they jack some of your new product, put it on the street.
suddenly things ain't so peaceful anymore.
you and your girlfriends here go and take them out, right?
solid motive, no?
you guys got it all figured out now, huh?
actually, no, I don't.
see, the three of them were killed with their own guns.
so where'd you get the guns, Petrix?
pay y'all too much money.
Yeah.
nobody jacks my stuff, you hear me?
don't you read The Wall Street Journal?
three stooges who have what you got because there was speculation of a merger.
you, uh, were going to do business with them?
so what does that say? If you can't shoot them, join them?
the fact is: their murder cost me money.
I'm not pleased about that.
now, if that's all, Officer, I got some new investors to meet with.
y'all take care.
so what do you think?
nightclub, Mercedes, loft.
I'd like to be able to put him at one of the scenes.
do you really think that we wouldn't run the plates of a homicide victim and put a bulletin out on the car?
bitch, I don't know nothing abouno Duckens or Clickins.
it's Duckens Labranche, and you call me bitch one more time,
I'll make sure that your pimp knows that you're turning tricks without his knowledge.
now, Duckens Labranche-- you're driving his car.
gave it to me.
he gave you his $150, 000 Mercedes?
I'm that good, bit...Detective.
did he give it to you before or after he got shot in the head?
did he get shot in the head?
after.
it was his last dying wish.
what was I gonna do, not obey his last dying wish?
not if you're the one who told him to make it.
let me guess.
he gave you this, too.
I never seen that before.
y'all planted that.
what about the blood on your bra?
plant that, also?
we're gonna take your clothes in, and get that blood tested, Vivian, and we all know who it's gonna come back to.
you were driving his car with the murder weapon inside of it, and you got his blood on...
all right, all right. Damn!
all I know is, you're looking for some guy in a blue hoodie.
it was all I could see from my...position.
you couldn't tell at all what his skin color was-- black, white?
no. It happened too fast. I freaked out.
I thought about calling 911, but that Mercedes is a nice payday.
besides, he's lucky someone came and shot his ass before I put 100 bullets in him like Sonny Bono.
you mean Sonny Corleone.
whatever.
Cluckens was gonna stiff me.
all he had in his wallet were play money.
what did you do with it?
tossed it.
what am I gonna do with that?
it's useless.
get her out of here.
come on.
no, Chief, I haven't forgotten who I'm talking to.
I'm not interested in your bureaucratic chain of command.
I run this division, you hear me?
and decisions affecting my personnel, affecting the lives of people who work their ass off for me...
get back to work.
will be brought to my attention before they're made!
I'm quite certain I've worked hard enough and saved your ass enough to earn that privilege.
let me guess. Sinclair?
if he thinks he can just let people go without talking to me first, he's seriously mistaken.
he's the Chief of Detectives, Mac.
he could let you go if he wanted to.
whose side are you on, Stella?!
okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait a second. Let's go back.
I don't even know what the hell this is all about.
city's making cuts.
our people are taking a hit.
Adam and six other lab techs.
sacrifices shouldn't be made in the manpower.
where then?
Sinclair said if I can find another $200, 000 in the budget, no one has to go.
what if we hold off on those automated DNA stations we ordered until after this budget thing blows over?
you're kidding me, right?
I mean, we've been waiting for over a year for those.
what Adam brings to the lab is worth waiting another six months.
they do ten times the work overnight.
it would take us a week.
come on, Mac.
you said yourself, the way they analyze DNA in masses-- I mean...
they can get a rapist off the street a day or two faster.
that means, a day or two that he doesn't rape another victim.
Yeah, yeah, and how many rapists can Adam help catch in the six months we wait?
how many murderers has he helped put away since he first started here?
fingerprints, hairs, fibers.
not to mention his expertise in computer-related investigations.
I'll take Adam every time.
he works his ass off.
losing him could hurt the city even more.
you think I don't know that?
I love Adam, Mac!
but passing on those automated work stations -
that keeps our lab a year behind in the technology.
let's say we wait.
who's to say Sinclair will actually pay for them in six months?
I don't think you have a choice here.
mac, you have a minute?
unless you're asking for money.
the gun we recovered from the Mercedes was also used in the Manny Sky homicide, just like the others.
we're looking for new evidence now, Lindsay.
somebody used that gun to kill Duckens Labranche.
well, I wasn't able to get any prints off the gun, but you know what they say?
when life hands you lemons...
limonene.
citrus terpene from fruit rinds.
I found significant traces of it on the grip and the barrel.
it's used in various cosmetics, cleaning solvents, even biofuel, so maybe we can link one of those uses to our perp.
we better.
ready to be shocked?
at this point, Stella, I'm not sure that's possible.
the barb wounds on Labranche's neck were caused by something like this.
it fires a wireless charge with four barbs.
packs a 1, 500 volt punch for up to 20 seconds.
believe it or not, that's not the most shocking part.
see, whoever used this on Duckens Labranche probably wasn't walking around with something this big, so I looked it up on line, and they sell handheld stun gun versions.
after going through customer sales lists for the last year,
I came up with this name you might find interesting.
Yeah. She was scheduled to testify against our victims.
that's not possible.
Why?
because I told her she wouldn't have to.
you saw something, and we need your help catching these guys.
they laughed after they shot that man.
they stood over him, and they laughed.
good, Maggie.
what can you tell me about them?
if I tell you, I'll be a witness.
I can see that that doesn't happen.
if we find these guys, and I collect enough evidence, you won't have to take the stand.
not what you were expecting, huh, Detective?
when did this happen?
a week ago.
after I got the subpoena.
I'm on my way.
well, you'll just have to wait and see, but you're gonna like it, trust me.
it's my specialty.
okay. I love you. Bye-bye.
listen to me very carefully.
I'm gonna make this clear as I know how.
you get on that witness stand, you die.
you hear me?
just in case you think I'm playing...
we gonna leave you with a little reminder.
thankfully, I started carrying a stun gun.
let's get out of here.
God knows what I would have looked like if they'd have kept going.
clearly, your word doesn't mean much, Detective.
so much for promising her she wouldn't have to testify.
Kevin... don't.
do you guys even care?
do you realize what it means to ask someone to be a witness?
my sister put her life on the line so you could close a case.
if we find these guys, and I collect enough evidence, you won't have to take the stand.
you promise me?
I promise.
make that promise to all your witnesses?
when I asked you to tell me what you knew a year ago,
I was trying to protect you, Maggie.
if you didn't talk to me, the DA would have subpoenaed you anyway, and by that time, it would have been too late.
part of my job is allowing the evidence I collect to speak for the living, as well as the dead.
you're lucky she's not dead.
enough, Kevin.
my brothers aren't quite as forgiving as I am.
based on what I collected after speaking to you, there was no reason for you to testify.
take that up with the DA.
you can bet on that.
I still would have testified, you know, even after this.
I wasn't scared anymore.
but they got what they deserved.
Maggie... I'm sorry, truly.
Yeah.
counselor, what the hell happened in the Manny Sky case?
why did you subpoena Maggie Hall?
she was a witness, you know that.
I collected enough evidence to keep her off the stand and put those bastards away for a very long time.
the evidence was suppressed.
what do you mean, suppressed.
Why?
don't worry.
nothing to do with your team.
well, I'm sure it didn't.
who screwed up?
it's not completely clear.
chain of custody issues.
someone removed the evidence from the property clerk without signing it out.
you can't be serious.
you know was well as I do these things happen.
with budget cuts, fewer employees-- things just fall through the cracks.
including peoples' faith in the system.
why are you so worked up over this?
Maggie Hall was not supposed to testify.
mac, she was a witness.
she made a statement.
the prospect of her being called by the prosecution shouldn't be surprising to you.
I promised her.
I promised she wouldn't have to take the stand.
why would you do that?
because if I didn't, you wouldn't have had a case.
I collected that evidence based on statements she made to me.
I promised her, damn it!
Yeah, well, don't get pissed at me for making a promise you knew you couldn't keep.
Petrix Derosier had more motive for killing Stanton, Jones and Labranche than we actual have for still being here.
I agree with you, Detective, but Derosier has been public enemy number one at the DEA for the past eight months.
you haven't put a case together in eight months?
we're thinking long term.
I mean, Derosier's big, but we're after all his connections as well, so...
we're using all the gadgets.
we've had Petrix and his crew under 24-hour wire surveillance, and cell phone tower records have helped us track their individual positions.
so you're saying they have an electronic alibi.
Petrix and his men could've easily passed their phones off to someone else.
we thought so, too.
well, you tell our friends in Brazil if they want a piece of the action, they should quit watching turtles lay eggs on the beach and get their asses on a plane.
we've got confirmed voice recognition for Petrix and his entire crew.
so Petrix is dirty, but clean.
that still leaves us Luther Stanton, Duckens Labranche, Michael Jones -
three defendants murdered on the eve of their trial.
if this wasn't about a drug war, then why the hell were these guys killed?
here's a twist.
remember the limonene trace I got on the gun that Stella found?
it turns out that one of Maggie Hall's brothers stocks fruit at a supermarket.
which brother? - Kevin Hall.
he works at a produce warehouse on the West Side Highway.
strong motive.
two more at home just like him.
three brothers, three shooters.
three victims.
maybe Maggie's brothers turned murder into a family affair.
look, all I'm saying is, if that was your sister who got cut up like that, the bodies of the guys who did it, they'd be unrecognizable.
you kidding me? You wouldn't find the bodies.
exactly.
and that's what the jury members are going to say about these guys.
Yeah, but come on, straight-up acquittal?
I give the jury a little more credit for following the law.
it's not even going to go that far.
I mean, the right play would be to cop a plea, man one, no life on the back end, they're guaranteed to get out at some point.
we're going to need more if the DA wants to leverage a plea.
your guy's not talking either?
he's got plenty to say, just not about the homicides.
these guys look good for it, but...
how did they get ahold of the three guns the vics' used to commit the homicide they were on trial for?
there's no trace of these guys at any of the scenes.
we got motive up the wazoo, but I mean, they were good.
they covered their tracks like they did it before.
mac, what if it was your sister?
I'd kill 'em.
okay, Mac, nobody at the bar where Michael Jones was killed remember seeing any of Maggie's brothers.
bartenders, bouncers-- they weren't scanning IDs.
recanvassing of the Tribeca loft didn't get us anything.
none of the neighbors recognized the photographs.
alibis?
as you know, they're not talking so we can't confirm or deny whatever story they plan on concocting, but I was able to verify that all three were not working that night.
and there were no phone calls from their home phone lines within an hour of the shootings.
cell phones?
multiple calls between all three brothers up to two hours before the shootings.
all right, both of you get in touch with Anti-crime.
find out if any of their informants remembers one of the brothers trying to buy a piece.
I want to know how they got the vics' guns.
all right.
Adam, give me something.
I need to put one of Maggie's brothers at the nightclub.
I'm working as fast as I can, boss.
half of these bottles need to be reconstructed in order to get a print off them, and as far as DNA goes, um, well, to be honest with you, those robots wouldn't really help.
these are all completed?
Yeah, I'm running them through AFIS as we speak.
if you get a hit, call me immediately.
Absolutely.
what they did to Maggie pushed you over the edge.
and you weren't going to let them get away with it.
sometimes, even scumbag lawyers have a heart.
nine times out of ten, I feel like jumping across this table and ringing the person's neck, you know.
I have to admit, right now I'm torn.
I almost feel like buying you a beer.
I'm just throwing this out there, but killing your clients can't be good for business.
right?
I mean, how do you expect to get referrals?
you and your co-counsel met back in 2001 working at Legal Aid.
city attorneys are required to be fingerprinted.
those prints are still on record.
they're also on a shot glass that we found on the table next to Michael Jones' body.
I'm guessing you had to steel your nerves.
the guns...
when the print came back to you, I kept asking myself how you got hold of the murder weapon.
then it hit me.
they gave them to you.
handing the gun to an attorney was the safest place.
Jake Donovan couldn't reveal that he had it, it's privileged information, so he shoved it in a drawer.
but when his office was fumigated the other day, we found trace amounts of a pesticide containing limonene on one of the guns -
the gun they gave to you.
these are your phone records.
every day for the past two weeks you called your client at 8: 00 a. m. presumably to remind him to get his ass out of bed and get to court.
but the day the trial started, you didn't call.
now I wonder why that is.
every other case was about some dope dealer killing some dope fiend or...
someone getting killed over whose corner was whose.
so when they said don't worry about a witness or that witness disappeared,
I never gave it a second thought.
one less crackhead on the streets looking to rob some old lady for a fix.
Yeah, b-but that girl...
you talk the other two into it?
I didn't have to talk anybody into anything.
she was still going to testify.
did you know that?
she was going to do the right thing.
I suppose a confession is too much to ask for?
I may have a heart, I'm not stupid, Detective.
you know what the great thing about all this is?
right now there's a young, cocky, naive lawyer, just like I was, and I'll work the system and I'll get off.
I'll walk.
can you honestly tell me I shouldn't?
yo, boss.
Danny, what's up?
I put in for that vacation next month.
that's right-- the trip to Costa Rica.
Yeah, Costa Rica.
well, it fell through, so you can put me back on the schedule, all right?
all right, I'll do that.
just let me know when you want to take the time.
all right. Thanks.
Hey.
remember that wedding in Italy I told you about in March?
girlfriend from college?
very good.
well, they decided to postpone. So...
you want back on the schedule?
Yeah.
no problem.
Thanks.
Hey, Mac...
hold on.
don't tell me-- trip to San Francisco in January?
Yeah, turns out San Francisco is closed in January.
strangest thing.
get out of here.
go home.
I should've known you'd orchestrate something like this.
it's only temporary.
everybody giving up a week of paid vacation for Adam buys him a little time.
the department doesn't just transfer vacation days.
how did you do it?
I have a friend at the union who has a friend in the city council who has a friend, who has a friend.
Yeah, well, you're a good friend, Stella Bonasera.
and don't you forget that.
so what about Buenos Aires?
would've been a good trip.
you know, I know this nice little Argentinean restaurant down the block that might due.
great. You buying?
they got my daughter.
she was here, but jericho found her and took back to afghanistan.
you're going to afghanistan?
sure am.
it's about the raven river experiments.
that's what my friend wanted to talk to you about. he texted you.
what do you know about the text?
the flash-forwards... The blackout... We can't solve it without you.
we engineered thousands of flash-forwards.
we have to protect ourselves from the effects of another blackout.
we have to anchor consciousness if another wave happens.
you' gonna be saved by the lady you see every day.
I have to get pregnant now.
I wantthatbaby. i want this specific child.
it was supposed to happen this weekend.
if it's baby-making you need, i will take one for the team.
that night in somalia-- - oh, demetri.
I'm pregnant.
I reviewed your uncle teddy's autopsy x-rays.
you murdered him to send a message.
message received.
I should have known--two moles, in case one is caught.
and not one person in the office would suspect it's you.
the yellow brick road-- a 6-mile killer obstacle course.
every quantico graduate dreads it, but we all do it.
I never intended to be an fbi agent.
I was a lawyer and hated my life.
then i had this friend who joined the bureau.
stop being such a girl!
Oh, stop being such a bitch!
I never thought of myself as particularly patriotic.
but it sounded cool.
I like the idea of being part of something, actually trying to make the world a safer place.
nice going.
you're not gonna tell everybody i almost didn't make it, right?
no, i'm just gonna show 'em this picture.
last one to the barbed wire is a wuss.
that was a $5 camera!
I loved it. i loved every second of it.
Quantico made me strong.
it taught me what mattered, and it showed me i'm capable of tackling problems i never thought possible.
of course, i've never lived in los angeles, so we'll see how i survive this.
I'm sure you'll do just fine.
are you married?
Oh, no.
I don't really have time for a serious relationship.
good to know.
I'm sorry.
I've been going on and on.
um, what was your name again?
I'm lita.
we'll take two more.
so what do you do?
I'm a headhunter.
I find talented people like yourself and... Offer them opportunities.
well, i just started at the bureau, and i'm not really looking to quit.
who said anything about quitting?
I know all about your job.
I'm just talking about a little multitasking.
the originals are being analyzed by forensics right now.
the only other thing of potential relevance is frost's final bon mot
in the end you'll be saved by the lady you see every day.
I can't speak on balf of everyone, but i'm still contemplating the unbelievable fact that we had the possible mastermind of the global blackout in our hands, and just before he's able to divulge any real information, he's killed by a terrorist who, just mere hours before, was in our custody.
now how the hell does that happen?
I don't know. what i do know is demetri noh is alive.
Yeah, and alda's free again, which means demetri was right all along
that she's been involved in this thing since the beginning, even before you guys started surveilling her.
believe me, i want her back just as much as you do.
in the meantime, frost did confirm that there will be another blackout.
he was coming in from the cold, and these blueprints and photographs are what he was bringing with him.
that alone makes them vital to our investigation.
this man was insane.
how do we know that anything he's even giving us is credible?
because crazy as he was, he was always true to his word.
but if you want to kick over more anthills
mark, this isn't about what i-- - can we please dial back the testosterone?
that's enough.
thank you.
Janis is running point on photos and blueprints, high priority.
shel, dem said frost referenced something called raven river as the place where the flash-forwards started happening.
see what you can find out about it.
this tracks something i was already running down.
so keep running.
when demetri gets back, he can jump in with you.
look, we're clearly on the right track.
the bad guys were obviously desperate to keep us from getting to frost.
let's take that as a sign we're getting warmer and push on.
okay, soa9 run his labs.
start an i. V. i'll be there in ten minutes.
Yeah. bye.
it's important, olivia!
how did you get in here?
I know you. - my husband is fbi, okay?
so there's an agent right out front.
I'm gonna call him, and he's gonna take you-- - the pixies. the pixies.
you were there. you were there.
you wore a purple beret.
the drink spilled on the lady in front. she got mad. she got so mad.
I was there, too, with my handler, barry.
Barry lost his job for taking me to a pixies concert.
they closed with "wave of mutilation.
the summer after med school?
I was at scott's wedding at the vineyard.
remember scott's wedding at the vineyard?
your dress was turquoise. you cried.
it was sad. it was ssad.
they served mini corn dogs.
I don't know who you are. what do you want from me?
I'm gabriel mcdow. i told you that.
I said--i definitely said that already.
you have to remember things, olivia.
like i said, my husband is fbi, so there's an agent out front.
I'm gonna call him, and he's gonna take you away. - he's not your husband. lloyd
you know lloyd? lloyd is. - what?
Yeah, you made a mistake. you should be with lloyd.
I tried to stop you, only you don't know that, because i onlytriedto stop you.
I have to tell you all about it.
it was a thursday. there's so much i need to tell you.
it's all at raven river.
get the hell out of my house!
no, don't go! don't go!
the proof of the pudding is in the eating!
don't buy coffee today from the man that looks like mr. clean!
don't buy coffee today! don't buy coffee, today! - dan, there's a man in my house!
Janis, thank you for coming in on such short notice.
I'm worried about your baby.
Why?
I thought you said everything looked good.
you're anemic, and you haven't gained enough weight.
I want you to see a perinatologist to get a high-resolution ultrasound.
now she'll make sure that the placenta's okay and the baby is growing.
and what if it isn't?
first things first.
get that ultrasound, and get it soon.
you've got to protect your baby.
I can't believe this is happening right now.
Yeah, but, mark, he was in our house.
I mean, i could have been killed.
Charlie must have been terrified.
no, charlie was already at school.
why would this man be stalking you?
I don't know. l i know is that there's something incredibly wrong with him.
okay, look, i'm gonna have to call you back.
soon. - okay. bye.
Ralph, what happened?
some teenager driving and texting jumped a curb and hit a couple people waiting for coffee out front.
he was going, like, 80.
doesn't look good.
don't buy coffee today from the man that looks like mr. clean!
Oh, my god.
can i help you, hon?
Yeah. i'm looking for some red flower dragon heads.
you mean some red dragon flowerhorns?
Yeah.
do you have any here?
I might. do you have a freshwater tank oraltwater?
I'm sorry. i was supposed to ask for carline.
that's me.
um... I'm janis.
lita sent me to you. - i know.
so let's get you set up with an aquarium, shall we?
Yeah, i don't actual really need an aquarium.
I think a 5-gallon tank ought to do the trick.
we got your blue coral here, a power supply, air filter, water conditioner, a couple of plants and some incandescent bulbs.
I'm a little confused.
honey, if you're going to be coming in here every couple of weeks to talk to me, then you need an excuse.
Yeah, i don't really like fish.
you do now.
so what do you think-- neon tetras or zebra fish?
the... Tetras, i guess.
I'm sorry. what exactly is it that i'm supposed to be doing?
well, for now, your job.
be the best special agent at the l. A. bureau that you can be.
watch, wait, win their trust.
and while you're at it, keep us apprised of what they're up to.
now these swordtails can be very aggressive.
sometimes they eat each other.
fish are like that.
here we go.
the photos that we found on frost are platinum prints, which dates the photos between 1890 to 1917.
but the guy from the getty says that it's likely the latter part of that time period.
we were able to recover two sets of prints
frost's, of course, and alda hertzog's.
alda? how would she have gotten her hands on these photos?
maybe she was with him before he met with you?
no.
she barely would have had time to make it to the desert before killing frost.
they must have crossed paths even earlier.
another weird thing-- forensics analyzed these photos and the blueprints for trace chemicals, and they found particulate matter specific to soil in the kunar province of afghanistan.
Yep, u.S. department of agriculture keeps a soil database.
what would frost be doing in afghanistan?
don't look so alarmed.
you will only draw more attention.
who are you?
I'm here at the request of our mutual friend stanford wedeck.
you're malik? - and you are looking for your daughter.
but now is not the time to exchange biographies.
we need to leave.
you already said that.
those men over there-- one of them is making a phone call.
the best outcome of that call is a man on his way here to kidnap you.
the worst--that man with a bomb strapped to his chest.
I believe that is what you call a loselose situation.
you don't blend as well as you think.
thank you, professor corey, for looking at these.
if these blueprints can be authenticated, this would be an incredibly cool find.
kind of reminds me a lot of the antikythera mechanism.
I'm not familiar with that.
it's one of the great mysteries of modern science.
it was a bronze artifact discovered in the mediterranean in 1901.
turned out to be this incredibly sophisticated sort of calculator from second century b. C. greece.
they've got it on display at the national archaeology museum in athens.
and you think this is something like that?
Yeah, looks like it.
the antikythera calculated dates of solar eclipses, but i'll be damned if i can figure out what this calculates.
if you'll let me keep these, i'll scan them, do some 3-d imaging, translate the ancient greek and, uh, see what i can come up with.
call me when you know something.
who has copies of these?
we've got an antiquities professor studying the originals right now, and benford's got a copy on his board.
get them back.
what do you mean?
I mean get me the original and destroy every copy that's been made.
what's so important about this thing?
I don't recall answering questions being part of our arrangement.
the inrmation goes one way, period.
get me these blueprints.
sweetie, you want me to make you that frozen pizza?
no. i'm all full on popcorn.
okay. squirrlio.
I'll give you 20 bucks for it.
what are you doing?
what are you doing, janis?
I totally screwed up, mark.
that's an understatement.
you broke into my office, and you're removing things from the mosaic board.
I know. i'm an idiot.
professor corey called me.
professor corey?
the antiquities professor.
he misplaced the blueprints that i gave him.
so make him another copy.
I gave him the originals. you have the only other copy.
you didn't check the originals into evidenc no.
I had a doctor's appointment, so i just brought 'em with me.
how'd you get in?
you gave me your passcode. - wh?
that time... You were in washington with wedeck, and you need me to get...The geyer file for you.
right.
this is a rookie mistake, janis.
hand back the blueprints. you can get your copies tomorrow.
you should know better.
I know. i'm sorry.
I'm telling you, shel, he seemed to know a lot about me.
I mean, look, there he is again.
and you're sure you don't know this guy?
no, believe me. i would have rembered him.
that's weird.
and he brought up raven river again, like he did the other day.
do you have any idea what that is?
Yeah.
that's an interesting thing. there's a suspect we were tracking with the mosaic investigation.
well, he had mentioned something about raven river to demetri, so i did some research.
well, that's crazy. does mark know about this?
I'm putting the report together for him now.
there's a few raven rivers.
there's one in wisconsin, one in illinois.
there's a tennis club in ohio and a raven river hospital in arizona.
well, what kind of hospital?
psych hospital. it's been shut down for about 20 years now, and there was some controversy in the late '80s--abuses.
what kind of patients?
schizophrenics, and they were the first hospital in the country to deal with autism.
autism?
W-what about savants?
she was trying to get away from them.
that's why she came home.
but jericho-- they got eyes everywhere.
now they brought her back here.
how do you know they have not killed her?
I know.
you have proof?
she's alive.
I've seen it.
you seem confident in your beliefs.
I envy you.
you must know that what you're asking is no smallundertaking.
kandahar is not baghdad, mr. stark.
it's not even kabul.
finding a single person anywhere in this country is next to impossible.
there was someone else there, someone think can lead us to her.
who? - his name's khamir dejan.
he's a doctor-- friend of tracy's.
he knows the location where i found her.
we find him, he can lead us there.
it's not that simple. evenf he is in this region, it will take time.
where she was, there was writings on the wall.
does that mean anything to you?
eyes on the mountain.
it's a medical relief organization, nongovernmental.
you said that khamir was a doctor.
Yeah.
this group--they have bases all over the country.
if he is working for them, we can find him.
and the roadblocks?
I know all of them. i know how to get around them.
where do we start?
we head south towards the mountains.
I've seen the test results from dr. weaver.
let's have a look, shall we?
there's your baby, and there's the heartbeat.
is she okay?
is she too small?
no, the head size is normal.
placental blood flow, it's--it's okay.
but the abdominal girth isn't what i'd want to see.
I know your work is very demanding, janis, but you're going to need to take better care of yourself.
get eight to ne hours of sleep a night, eat a high-protein diet and...
reduce your stress.
you know those are not supposed to be on in here.
look, i know life is complicated. everyone's is.
but the health of your baby depends on your ability to - -to stay off your feet and lower your stress.
I'm serious. otherwise, you could lose this baby.
I'm sorry. i have to take it. it's my boss.
Hey, mark.
professor corey's sitting in my office, and he's just given me some very interesting information.
I think you better get back here.
professor corey.
ms. hawk. weirdest thing happened yesterday.
therwas a power failure in the entire building, erased every hard drive in the joint.
Really? - yeah.
and i can't seem to find those blueprints you gave me...
which is why it's a damn good thing i took pictures on my phone and printed 'em out.
I wanted to get a head start.
great.
I, uh, did some quick and dirty 3-d imaging of the device.
seems to be some kind of mechanical, astronomical clock...
with gears and levers designed to calculate a certain date, or rather, a series of dates.
what dates?
when i do the math, the first date i keep coming up with is october 6, 2009...
the date of the blackout.
Janis hawk. - it's benford. get wedeck. suspects are on the move.
mark, i'm putting you on speaker.
what do you got?
Khalid, omar and an unidentified caucasian woman.
we're e-mailing you pictures right now.
who is she?
uh, that's the "unidentified" part, sweetheart.
get these to digital forensics and run 'em by i. S.O.
okay. - thanks.
you've had a partial abruption, ms. hawk.
the good news is you've stopped bleeding.
you're gonna have to really watch your physical activity from here on out.
do you want to know the sex of your baby?
well, considering the circumstances...
get up - i want out. - it's normal to be upset.
millions of people died yesterday, carline.
I lost friends, people i know and work with.
nobody told me this was the plan when i was recruited.
you said there was gonna be an event, but you never said it would be like this.
did you know this was gonna happen?
I don't answer questions, janis.
we've already been over this.
I don't want to do this anymore.
I want outnow.
I'm really sorry you feel that way, janis, but you can't get out.
you're in way too deep.
surely you're bright enough to realize that.
you know, it's funny. i never heard you complaing when you were pocketing all that money.
you didn't think there was a price?
you're a despicable person.
man up, sweetheart.
this is what we do, and even if i wanted to cut you loose, that's not my call to make.
okay, then i want to talk to the person whose call it is.
that's not gonna happen... Ever.
if i were you, i'd go on home, pour yourself a couple of stiff ones, lick your wounds, because tomorrow i expect you back in here spilling your guts.
it's like the setting in one of those slasher movies.
I'm more of a clint eastwood type guy, myself.
I hope you told someone where we were going.
Ah, so they'll know where to find our bodies?
here you go.
Oh, thank you.
mildew.
I'm gonna look around down here.
okay. you call me if you get lost.
you're not gonna find... What you're looking for there, olivia.
I knew you'd be here.
you're always here.
I'm heading out.
what's up with you? hmm?
you've been distracted.
you haven't been yourself.
you've been coming in late, disappearing for lengths of time.
what is it?
I'm pregnant.
that's... Congratulations.
your flash-forward really is coming true.
and there was a question of the health of the baby.
so i just... I don't know. i guess i just lost it.
I lost my edge.
but i'm okay.
everything's good.
great.
mark, i just hope that you know you can still count on me.
Janis... I never doubted that.
Thanks.
you know, i can't stop thinking about frost's last words
in the end, you'll be saved by the lady you see every day.
what the hell does that mean, hmm?
well, clearly, that means m gonna save your ass, mark.
no. i don't know.
maybe it means olivia's gonna save my ass.
let's go over this again.
what do we know about dyson frost?
we know he went under the alias "d. gibbons." - and he played chess brilliantly.
and faked his own death once upon a time.
D. gibbons escaped. we got a white queen.
chess...
the lady you see every day.
in chess, the queen's known as the lady, right?
no.
crazy son of a bitch was right.
your family?
I'm taking you where you want to go.
what else do you need to know?
how about what you saw? that's a start.
my wife and daughter-- we're in a car together.
we black out. the car goes over the embankment.
I survive.
it doesn't matter what i saw.
a future without them is no future at all.
I'm sorry.
you know, i envy that you believe in the possibility of good.
Taliban?
I don't know.
I thought you said you knew all the factions. isn'at why wedeck sent you to me?
I don't know this one.
I'll take care of it.
how'd you find me?
well, you... Don't blend in as well as you think.
my--my friend-- the one who texted you-- he--he was here.
we--we were here.- olivia!
we were here. he was here. we--we were here together.
you okay? - yeah.
do you understand now? tell--you understand now?
no, gabriel, i don't understand anything.
how--how did you know about the car accident at the hospital?
I sait.
well, what did you mean when you said that i made a mistake about lloyd?
uh, it's what i saw.
Lloyd and olivia sitting in a tree, k-i-s-- okay, stop.
stop.
s what i saw.
you saw it?
this is where they did it. - gabriel, where are you going?
this is where they did it.
this is where they did it.
where they did what? - this is where they did it... The experiments.
what experiments?
every other day for two years... We came here.
theyut us to sleep.
they put us to sleep.
I never knew where i'd end up.
sometimes it was a short trip.
I was eating a tuna sandwich.
cat jumped on the table. kitty likes tuna.
sometimes it was a long trip.
he watches from there.
who?
the doctor...
he told us we were special 'cause we could remember things... Everything.
and then when we came back, we had to write it all down, every--every little detail.
that's the way the cookie crumbles.
the...- Flash-forwards?
you're talking about flash-forwards.
he--he said we were special because we could remember the future.
I said that already. did i say that already?
I'm sorry i said that already. - it's okay. it's okay, gabriel - it's okay. - i said that already.
youarespecial. you're-- you're a savant. you all were.
he used you for your eidetic memories like human recorders.
when they finished with us...
when they used us all up...
he told them to kill us so we wouldn't tell.
he's dead now.
you don't have to be afraid of him anymore.
the early worm catches the bird.
I've been waiting.
I've been waiting. - gabriel, why have you been following me?
it's an emergency.
you're-- you're going the wrong way.
so i-i have to turn you around, olivia,'cause you're going the wrong way.
what wrong way?
in the futures i saw, i always sawyou, olivia.
me? - yeah, and you're always with lloyd.
at harvard, by the pipe shop, i-i tried to smoke that day, but i threw up.
and--and we were friends.
we were friends because i was the janitor in the-- no, gabriel.
I didn't go to harvard. i came to california. i went to u. C.L. A.
I married mark.
in the futures i saw, you're supposed to be with lloyd.
you're always with lloyd-- not that other one.
Lloyd.
harvard was a fork in the road.
you have to listen to me, olivia.
you have to--have to rember these things, because they're important.
you have to be here for things to come.
you're a piece of the puzzle. they--they can't solve it without you!
gentlemen, it's been p. E.T. scanned, c.T. scanned and subjected to neutron emissions analysis.
what the hell is it-- some kind of little electronic kryptonite?
no, no, no. this is more complicated.
our analyst is saying it makes our current tech look kind of primitive.
they have no idea what it is.
that's why i've invited simon and lloyd to join us.
suspect zero has one, too.
you think he and dyson frost were working together, huh?
possibly. we know that d. gibbons--frost-- made numerous calls during the blackout.
as far as we know, they were the only two people in the world awake during the blackout.
suspect zero was wearing a ring, and frost had this one in his possession.
it's a q. E.D. - what?
a quantum entanglement device.
my god. it exists.
this is what we were discussing in our flash-forwards.
english, gentlemen. english, please.
okay. let's start with the basics, all right?
theoretically, frost and his pals ramped up our linear accelerator to such extreme energies that it sent shock waves through the consciousness field and jolted all of humanity's awareness to a different place in space-time--the flash-forward.
now suspect zero and frost were awake during the time of the blackout, correct?
they were in some way protected.
clearly. so you think this ring
is a device which anchored their minds to their current location in space-time.
in other words, it helped them stay conscious.
you're saying this little thing kept those guys from blacking out?
maybe this is why they were so anxious to attack our offices on april 29th.
maybe they weren't coming for me. they were coming for this.
and nothat we know that, we can figure out a way to stop them.
Mr. vogel? janis hawk.
I was told to meet you by assistant director bramwell.
Yes, ms. hawk. please sit.
congratulations on graduating today.
surviving quantico is no small accomplishment.
thank you.
I was told this is about a special assignment, but i'm actually starting in the l. A. office next month.
ms. hawk, i'll get right to the point. i'm not with the bureau.
as i'm sure you're aware, historically, the bureau and the agency haven't always cooperated as closely as they might have.
we're trying to change that.
you're cia.
as a part of a still-classified operation, we've assessed your graduating class and found half a dozen candidates potentially vulnerable to hostile recruitment.
and i'm one of them? - yes.
your financial situation, your sexual orientation, your unconventional upbringing
they all make you a potential target.
well, that's ridiculous. you're wrong.

washed up on the bay. They think it could be Carlie Richardson.
and I'm supposed to know who that is?
Yeah. Disappeared a year ago, she was pregnant.
come on, Bones. You have to get a TV, you know.
or at least just thumb through a People at the checkout stand.
was it in the Journal of Forensic Anthropology?
Oh, you know, I forgot to renew my subscription. You know what, Bones?
you really need to take up some other interests.
I'm reading Ted Joya's History of Jazz. Was she mentioned in there?
or maybe in McGee's Science and Lore of the Kitchen.
or perhaps I should develop an interest in the mainstream media's exploitation of crimes for their entertainment value.
it's amazing, Bones. You can really be snotty sometimes.
so, Carlie Richardson?
Carlie Richardson, newlywed. Everyone assumed that she was murdered.
husband was cheating on her, there was evidence that they had a fight that day.
he was covered in scratches. Witnesses said that they saw him down by the marina.
but, hey, you know, without the body, they had to kick him free.
well, if she's been in the water for a year, the bones will be saturated.
I'll need nylon mesh bagging and...
cam's bringing in everything on the truck.
well, after a year, there's not going to be a lot of flesh for Cam to deal with.
well, you know, hey, Bones, you know, Cam, she's in charge now.
she runs the place, it's her call.
then let's hurry. I don't want my remains compromised.
okay.
I don't care if she's the boss.
the bones belong to me.
booth. Oh, yeah.
Rebecca. Whoa, wait a second. Slow down, okay?
this is my weekend with Parker, okay?
I am his father, all right?
Stu is your boyfriend.
we're gonna be in the water, Doc. Remember to bring Traxon and soluble tape.
does she think I'm new at this?
I developed the use of Traxon...
on the phone, Bones. - I know. Get off. We have to go.
Rebecca, he's spending a lot of time with Parker and I don't even know this guy.
she took Zack. Zack's mine.
because you know what?
I just want to make sure that he's a good influence.
the fact that he, you know, rocks, rocks your world, surprisingly that...
really, you know doesn't concern me.
I'll just meet you there.
doesn't concern me.
I got to run, okay, Rebecca? We'll talk about this later.
wait up!
why can't you go faster?
I don't see why I couldn't drive.
because you're agitated. - I am not.
you know what? You've turned this into a competition between you and Cam.
I just like to be first on the scene, that's all, to protect the evidence.
she's not going to disturb anything.
no, it's all tissue and blood and DNA with her.
she doesn't appreciate the skeletal system.
you could take the I-70. It'll be quicker.
don't backseat drive, okay?
Oh, I think I know who's agitated.
someone is annoying me, okay? That's different.
your ex. - Huh?
that's who's annoying you. Because she has a new man in her life.
that's funny, you know, okay? I am concerned about my son.
I want to know what kind of guy this new boyfriend is.
and you know what? If she's not going to tell me, I'll find out on my own.
are you gonna run a background check on him?
when you have kids, we'll talk.
it's a lot to ask for a little conversation.
if you make a right, we can cut through Grafton.
fine.
she beat us here and she was in a truck.
well, you know, you're the one who wanted to go through Grafton.
well, you could have used the siren. I mean, why do you have one if you're not going to use it?
Oh! What's that smell?
Zack, I need some sterile tubes before she's fertilizer.
okay, that's the smell.
Caucasian, female, 25 to 30.
barnacle and small mussel encrustation indicates she's been in the water for about a year.
no. They have.
God.
the size of the fetal bones indicates the fetus was viable.
how could someone do this to their own kid?
multiple fractures.
they could be from an assault or from being battered by rocks and debris while in the water.
stab wounds evident on ribs, manubrium and clavicle.
and ulna, radius, one to the sphenoid.
this was a very violent attack.
you find the murder weapon?
not yet. The scuba guys just got here.
tell them to look for a left leg and missing fetal bones.
looks like we finally get to put Richardson away.
I love being a hero.
a heroine.
mm, sounds too druggy. I'm going with hero.
whoa, what are you doing?
scraping the adipocere from the hands.
no, you could compromise the bone.
you should use suction back at the lab if you want a conviction.
of course, it's your call.
are we gonna have another murder here, or what?
no, no. I have the utmost respect for the doc.
glad she works for me.
good.
the clothes, they match the ones she was last seen wearing.
the rope could be a match of the type found in Richardson's house.
while you two do your thing, I'm gonna go bring the son of a bitch in.
Where's Richardson? - I don't know!
he saw this and then he took off.
I tried to stop him, but then he hit me.
he said he's never coming back!
sources indicate both mother and her fetus were stabbed to death.
Kyle Richardson remains the chief suspect.
is the evidence taken from Kyle Richardson's house a year ago.
so, we got rope, the plastic sheeting, knife set, one knife missing, Richardson's DNA results.
file says witnesses placed Richardson at the marina on the bay the night she disappeared.
looks like he's not walking this time, Seeley.
ironic since he's running now.
Hodgins, you know Booth is bigger than you, right?
right.
wasn't your fault, dude.
let's focus, people. This should be a slam dunk.
we screw this one up, I'm gonna look like a fool and someone's gonna have to pay for that.
we just started collecting evidence.
there are boxes of evidence. The remains are icing on the cake.
let's just hand the prosecutor what she needs so I can have a nice weekend knocking back shots and playing poker.
Yeah, that should motivate us.
I'm going to strip the flesh and adipocere, remove anything from under the fingernails.
here lies a dead fish in the plastic.
Ooh, and it's not even my birthday.
he saved the fish.
stomach contents and particulates could give us drift patterns, show where she was left before she washed ashore.
not much left of the organs.
looks like I can still find a few surprises from what's left of this lung.
looks like some liver here.
I'll take any tissue that stuck to the plastic.
there'll be sediment and organic particulates.
what do you want?
george Clooney naked on a white sand beach, but I can give you faces after the skull's reconstructed.
Zack will start on them right away.
after you've stripped any tissue,
I would like to reassemble the victim and the fetus.
sounds like fun. Let's do it.
it was male.
he, not it, Bones.
I'm going to go talk to his girlfriend. No mistakes on this one.
he always was a little touchy.
Yeah.
I didn't know Kyle then.
we started going out after his wife went missing.
Mm-hmm. Did he ever mention the night she disappeared?
of course. It was terrible for him.
I just tried to support him and help him get past it.
he looks like he had a lot of people to help him.
and he looks really, really broken up.
I know he dated other women, but he's not who you think he is.
no, of course not.
Oh, my God! - Agent Booth, is that necessary?
just trying to help her remember.
he would never do this.
he could never do this.
he hit you when he was leaving, didn't he?
I know. That is because I wanted to go with him, and he knew everyone would be after him.
he was just trying to protect me.
Yeah, he's a real prince.
if he contacts you...
call.
otherwise, you're looking at obstruction of justice, aiding and abetting, and I'm surewe can find a few other charges to make it worth the money you're paying your lawyer.
there's another gash on the second rib, right side, approximately 45 degrees, left to right.
why didn't he just divorce her?
why did they have to get married in the first place?
it's an antiquated ritual.
Carlie Richardson believed in it, trusted her husband, and look what happened.
so this is marriage's fault?
committing yourself to one person isn't in the interest of the species.
I mean, you have multiple partners.
don't say it like that.
I date.
the notion of a committed relationship's fantasy.
look at Booth. Fighting with his ex, his son caught in the middle.
we make our lives out of chaos and hope and love.
someday you'll meet somebody.
I don't need anything more than I have now.
talk about a fantasy.
the skulls are in multiple pieces, but the damage is from debris in the water.
then let's start on the stab wounds.
I'd like you to confirm the type of knife used in each of these.
Oh, these all appear to be from the knife that was missing from the set taken from Richardson's.
appear?
no conclusions without corroboration.
but Dr. Saroyan seems certain that Richardson...
seems? You're my grad student. You work for me.
remember, Doc, we're building a case here, not getting our rocks off on research.
rocks and sediment are Hodgins' specialty.
you're serious?
okay.
brought your hand back.
I found organic material under the fingernails. Should match Richardson.
and I found something else I'd like you to look at.
it's right here in the lung.
it's a locket.
must've been around her neck and melted into the lung during putrefaction.
before I remove it,
I wanted to see if any of your cyborgs can do anything with the photo paper.
there's not enough left. It's liquefied.
it's probably just another picture of the lovebirds anyway.
Oh, what's this?
Oh, no. - Who's Kenny?
I don't know. I don't want to know. I just want it to be Richardson.
that's right because of the drinking and the poker.
Yeah, I know there's a lot of animals at the zoo.
monkeys... monkeys are Daddy's favorite.
they're just like people.
actually, three million base pairs of the genome differ in protein encodg and other functional areas.
what?
genetic differences between chimps and humans.
I'm talking to a four-year-old, Bones.
Oh, yeah...
you're spending a lot of time with Drew, huh? Oh, that's great.
okay, you've got to go eat. Okay, go eat. Make sure... okay, I love...
Yeah.
her boyfriend spending a lot of time with your son?
Yeah.
so you got any, uh, new information for me, Bones?
I'm sorry. Nah, it's no need.
it must be hard not being able to see him when you want to.
you see, this is information that I already know, Bones. Why don't you
let's say we just discuss the case, hmm?
sure.
you know, I'm his father.
you know, Parker knows that.
I mean, that's-that's what's important, not some stupid trip to the zoo.
Yeah, absolutely. - Right.
Yeah. - Done. Of course. Boom.
well, we found this in her lung.
what?
her lung? - It was enveloped during decomp.
any reference to a Kenny in the case file?
no, but whoever Kenny is liked her enough to get her a locket.
maybe Kyle wasn't the only one who was cheating.
opens up a lot of possibilities.
I say we just go talk to Carlie's friends and see if they know who Kenny is.
the four of us got so close being in the same Lamaze class.
losing Carlie was like losing a sister.
it was her idea to start this baby group.
we all felt so connected, feeling someone growing inside, waiting to meet them.
do you have kids? - He does.
they make you feel whole.
it's just a release of serotonin necessary for the survival of the species.
huh?
never mind, um... we found this, uh... locket on Carlie's remains, it says, uh,"I love you, Kenny." Did she ever mention a Kenny?
Yes. She talked about Kenny all the time.
he's never mentioned in the police report.
Kenny was her dog.
her dog?
Kyle bought her the dog when things we better between them. She loved that dog.
there used to be a picture of the two of them in there.
Oh, where is her dog now?
it died. Mary took care of it.
I'm a vet; they brought it in a few months before Carlie disappeared.
Kyle said he backed over it accidentally.
Rlie always felt he did it on purpose.
he was a real piece of work when he got mad.
a dead dog? Excellent.
so, we're back to one suspect: Richardson.
I like this. Good work.
do you want children?
what? - Children?
maybe, if I could find one that sleeps late and cleans.
does this apply to the case in any way?
no, just curious.
most people think it's odd when a woman doesn't want children, but, obviously, you don't.
are you pregnant?
no... I'm not.
why are you looking at me?
well, as long as you're not leaving the lab every two minutes to pee.
no intention of it.
so all this back and forth was for nothing.
good to know.
now, unless the liver has a written confession in it by a pet parakeet, we should have enough to build a solid forensic case against Richardson for the prosecutor.
I found something that might put a new wrinkle in things.
great.
Oh, God.
the fish was a Pomatomus saltatrix, a bluefish, common to Delaware Bay.
and there were dinoflagellates consistent with the saltwater in the bay.
dozing off, Hodge-podge.
but I also found didinium, a ciliate, and oomycota, a mold, both of which are found in freshwater.
so, the body was in fresh and salt water.
exactly. Freshwater first for at least six months.
okay, now we have witnesses that put Richardson at the marina that night; there is no freshwater what's going on here?
richardson is the only logical suspect. Are we working for the defense now?
I'm working for the victims and we have to be open to the evidence as it presents itself.
the knife, the rope, the plastic sheeting are all from Richardson's house, that's been confirmed.
we're trying to build a case here, people.
we don't ignore facts just because they might change the outcome of a case.
not asking you to, Doc, I just want you to fill in the blanks.
there must be freshwater close enough for Richardson to have dumped the body.
it has to have the same sediment, larvae, archaea, helminths...
great. Whatever the hel- minths those are find them.
and if we find a body of water that matches, it has to be dredged for additional body parts.
we're still missing the left patella, tibia and calcaneus.
and the fetus is missing the... - Okay, fine.
just stop talking and do it.
Hey, so... is this the only freshwater near the bay?
the only body of water that might have algae and sediment that could match what we found on the remains.
Whoo! Seems to be a lot of gamophyta.
is that good?
I won't know until I compare it to the samples in the lab.
then why'd you act so excited?
I guess I just like gamophyta.
you know, you really don't have to act any geekier.
the whole outfit does it for you.
geek chic, dude.
agent Blondie over there thinks I'm hot.
how ya doing?
anything?
another Top-Flite.
you know, I went out with a woman who had a little kid once.
aren't you supposed to be looking for slime?
the kid hated me, you know, he said I used too many big words.
well, he got that right. - He hit me in the head with a Tonka truck.
I could never sleep with his mom again.
well, you know, at least the story ends well.
I was good to him, though, you know? I mean, I did not deserve an 18-wheeler to the parietal bone.
Ooh, nematodes and planaria.
does that mean anything?
not sure.
anything?
bones. Could be from the fetus.
Hamate, triquetral, portions of the phalanges and another Top-Flite.
according to the reconstruction with these new bones, the fetus has seven fingers.
and two right hands.
I don't understand. Was there another victim?
double the magnification.
look at the structure of the phalanges.
the bones from the lake are from a raccoon.
the formation of the hands is almost identical to an infant's hand.
how did you do?
we found a raccoon, you?
the sediment and organic material from the lake doesn't match what was taken from the remains.
I have to look for another body of freshwater. I don't think it's around here.
what have you got?
nothing.
and the next body of freshwater that might be a match is over 60 miles away.
richardson couldn't have been there. It wouldn't match the timeline.
I've got the board of the Jeffersonian, the federal prosecutor and Nancy Grace ready to devour me if I don't hand them enough to indict Richardson.
well, if you want us to manufacture evidence...
no, I want us to find out who killed Carlie, and I'm pissed 'cause whoever did it is messing with me and I don't like that.
I like doing the messing.
then we have to determine whether we're wasting our time on Richardson.
tell me what you need.
his plates were found in a ditch on Route 432.
his car in a vacant lot in Huntsville.
he could be using another car or he could be hiding out.
can anybody I. D. him?
I've got I. D.s coming in from all over the place.
this is where the concerned citizens all come out for the reward.
excuse us, Agent Booth?
let me know if you find something. - Sure.
I'm Dennis Campbell. This is my wife, Patricia.
we're Carlie's parents. - Yes, I know. Please... sit down.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
well, at least now our daughter can rest with her baby and Kyle can never touch them again.
the reason we're here...
we were going through some photos for the funeral and...
we came across this one.
Kyle used to go out of town on business.
his firm had an office in Boston.
Carlie went with him once.
this is them with some people in Boston.
that woman on the news, Karen Tyler, she said she met Kyle after Carlie disappeared, but here she is looking at him.
he admitted to being involved with those other girls.
why did he lie about knowing her?
may I keep this photo? - Of course.
we need em to answer for this.
she was our little girl.
she wasn't supposed to go before us.
that's not the way it's supposed to be.
I know. We'll find Kyle.
I promise.
you want me to what?
stab the body for me.
we need match force with the injuries recorded on the remains.
okay, I'm stabbing the body.
well... it's a replica.
we're all going to do it, you're just the closest to Kyle Richardson.
okay, you know what, that's great.
I'll be there in 20, but in the future you just have to ask me differently, Bones, because you know what, come over to your place to stab a body, that is just freaky.
Seeley, you son of a bitch.
Oh... I, uh, Rebecca, wow, you look great.
Yeah, okay, save it, cause I need a lot more than compliments from you right now.
okay, just keep it down for a little bit, you know, cause I'm at work, all right?
you sent agents to investigate Drew because you're going to stop that now.
okay, listen, I'm just being cautious.
what do you really know about this guy anyway, huh?
I know...I-I-I know that he has a good job.
and I-I know that he fixes stuff around the house when he says he's going to.
and I know that Parker is crazy about him and he's not terrified every time he goes off to work that he's going to get shot and I know that I love him.
I love him.
and now everyone at work thinks he's a criminal.
well, he's been spotted with explosives.
he is a construction foreman, He does demolition,
I mean, you must've figured that out when you were doing all of your snooping.
look, I have a right to know who's hanging around my son.
all right, he spends more time with Parker than I do.
okay, you think that I would put Parker in danger?
let me ask you a question, Rebecca. Why is it that you keep all the men in your life such a secret?
because you always interrogate them or intimidate them and it freaks them out.
well, I mean, come on, a lot of them are a little strange, I mean, the guy with the tattoos on his neck.
hold on, I don't even have to let you see Parker, okay, not-not legally.
that's one of the upsides of not being married.
don't.
I'm a good father. You know that.
you have got to stop trying to run things.
I've got things in my life that have nothing to do with you.
all right, look. You know what? We are always going to have something to do with each other because we share a son.
drew's a good man, and you need to back off, or you're not going to see Parker again, I swear.
you back off.
here comes Kyle.
ha, ha, funny. Don't we have something to stab?
this. I hate my job.
from the depth of the stab wounds, we can tell the approximate force required in newton meters to inflict the marks we see on the bones.
so, we have to measure the amount of force generated when we stab to give us the the size, weight, and body type of the assailant.
you had to dress her up.
the clothes she wore figure in the resistance to the blows.
the knife is consistent with the one that caused the wounds.
we fitted it with an instrument and blade that will give us a digital readout of the newton meters of each stab.
it's a dual mass drop system.
all I hear is blah, blah, blah.
cliff Note's version-- we all stab, one of us is the killer.
thank you. Sort of like a real creepy party game.
the violence of the attack shows rage, so everyone should stab as hard as they can.
this better work!
that was weird.
okay, okay.
results?
the force used to make the injuries on the bones was 24 newton meters.
and the winner is, with 24 newton meters...
what?
Congratulations.
Really?
height and weight?
Oh, God. Uh, uh...
five, eight, one hundred and.
what? - 135.
it's all muscle.
five-seven and 132 pounds.
so, Kyle's girlfriend kills Carlie so they can be together?
well, then, why did Kyle run?
maybe he didn't. It sounds nuts but if she's the killer, maybe Karen got rid of him, you're sure that there's no way Richardson could have made these wounds?
with his strength, the blows would have sliced deeper into the bone.
well, these seemed to go right through.
well, those were delivered after she was on the ground.
so, Karen does the killing because they know everyone will be suspecting Kyle.
I'd prefer not to make any more assumptions.
there are particles in the knife marks.
when she was on the ground, the knife passed through the body and picked up sediment from the dirt.
the next stab imbedded that into the bone.
if I can get enough information from these particulates,
I might be able to locate the site of the murder.
DNA results came back. It was Kyle under her nails.
so he was there, too?
maybe. But we know he had a fight with her earlier that he admits.
fortunately, there was also the skin of somebody else.
test showed it was a woman.
we should get her DNA drawn as soon as possible.
smart. Let's go.
I didn't do it. I swear, I would never hurt her.
hmm. And the other day, you said you and Kyle didn't know each other until after Carlie disappeared.
because we both knew what everyone would think.
Karen, please don't say anything.
mm, even your lawyer thinks you did it.
Kyle thought we should separate and meet up in a few months, so, you know, it wouldn't look so bad.
well, that didn't work out, now, did it?
open your mouth.
do I really have to do this?
they have a warrant.
when you were sleeping with Kyle, didn't it matter to you that you're destroying a family?
we were in love.
Oh. Love. Sorry. Now it's a beautiful story.
open again.
Ouch!
Oops.
Kyle was going to tell her. We were going to be honest.
Mm,'cause you know you do that so well.
I would never hurt her.
and neither would Kyle.
right, the love of your life who no one has seen for two days.
can you see why I'm leery of relationships?
we hit paydirt.
actually, we hit silt containing the feces of the gypsy moth, some quartz, and mica.
that and the zinc levels in the dinoflagellates from the freshwater as well as the Pinaceae pollen led us to a patch of pitch pines outside of Gloucester City, New Jersey.
she was killed right here.
and when did they move her to the bay?
they didn't. They left her in New Jersey.
in the Rancocas Creek. She made it to the bay on her own.
Oh, what, she take the shuttle? - Basically.
two days after Carlie disappeared, there were thunderstorms in Central New Jersey.
heavy, heavy rains.
the body must have been flushed down the Rancocas and into the Delaware River.
th, she slowly made her way down the Delaware and into the bay.
the movement and the battering on the rocks loosened her weight, so she floated to the surface and washed ashore.
I'm pretty sure Karen didn't see that coming, hmm?
now you're sure this is it?
zinc, mica, feces-- this is the place.
uh, it's beautiful here.
Yeah, because, you know, that's important for a murder.
okay, the bodies were wrapped on the bank of the river.
sift the soil for the missing bones.
agent Booth?
over here.
look at that-- "C. R."
Carlie Richardson's initials.
you don't pack face cream and a nightgown if you're being abducted.
lot of vacation cabins nearby.
if she was upset, this would be a good place to unwind.
Oh, Karen Tyler said that she liked Carlie.
she could have befriended her to lure her up here.
maybe Carlie's friends knew that she and Karen were getting chummy.
did Carlie know about her?
I thought they just started going out.
no. They knew each other from before.
that bastard.
Carlie knew Kyle was cheating on her. That's why they were fighting.
and why she didn't want the baby.
did she say that? - I don't care what's happening.
to say that you don't want your child when you're getting ready to give birth
it's not right.
I think I did see this woman.
I was driving home from work. They were in front of a Starbucks.
I'm not sure if it was the day she disappeared, but I'm pretty sure it was around the same time.
Thanks.
your kid's eating sand.
I don't know how they can do it.
self-obsessed. They have no conscience.
I don't know.
they destroy anything that gets in their way. They're not even human.
the mothers? - Huh?
well, I was talking about the mothers.
I'm talking about the killers.
I understand killers.
I just don't know how mothers can do it.
I mean, dogs can be trained in a couple weeks.
with kids, mothers have to give up their lives for years.
I don't know. When you're looking at your kid, you don't even feel like you're giving up anything.
so you'd do it again? - What?
you'd have Parker even with everything you're going through.
what kind of question is that?
wouldn't it be easier if Parker wasn't caught in this drama of yours with Rebecca, the new boyfriend?
God, no, no. Bones, he's my son.
whatever we're going through, it's-it's not about that. He knows that.
that's what parents say when they want to justify themselves.
you know, I haven't walked out on Parker, all right?
I would never have done what your parents did.
well, I didn't say you would. I just...
I don't know.
you're the father. I don't know anything about raising kids, so...
Parker's fine.
it's not Karen Tyler. - What?
the DNA from under Carlie's fingernails doesn't match.
and something else is weird.
tissue from the fetus shows evidence of escitalopram.
what's that?
it's a drug prescribed for depression.
it's not weird.
Carlie Richardson was having emotional problems with her husband.
Carlie Richardson wasn't taking the drug.
hold on. None of this is making any sense.
I agree.
the only way the fetus could have the drug in its system is if it were passed from the mother in utero.
or through breast milk.
how do you breast-feed an unborn child?
an infant skull is made up of several separate bones that are... eventually fuse together.
look at the molding here.
Oh, my God.
I don't believe it.
Yeah.
okay. Now everybody knows but me.
this is not a fetus.
the skull bones have shifted and overlapped because this child passed through the birth canal.
this baby was born alive and lived about two weeks.
but Carlie was pregnant when she was last seen.
this isn't Carlie Richardson's child.
the escitalopram in its system came from breast milk.
then what happened to her baby?
the baby was cut out of her and stolen.
this child replaced it.
this child was dead before Carlie was murdered.
you can see the traces of blood pooling in the cranium.
abusive head trauma.
evidence of shaken baby syndrome.
Oh, God.
you said the little guy was only two weeks old.
whoever the mother was was probably taking the mediation for postpartum depression.
she got upset with the baby
crying's the most common cause
and she shook him to quiet him down.
it can take as little as five seconds for an infant to die by shaking.
five seconds?
the veins that attach the brain to the inside of the skull detach.
blood pools, the brain swells...
okay, I get it.
all right, so what you're saying is that the mother kills her own son and replaces him with Carlie's.
fits the pattern-- she feels the guilt about what she's done and needs to make it right, prove to herself that she's still a good mother, so she takes Carlie's child and makes it her own.
it's only been two weeks. Not many people have seen her kid.
who would know? - Yeah, but the stab wous?
all of Carlie's stab wounds are to the upper part of the body.
the killer was careful not to hit close to the uterus because she wanted the baby alive.
your report indicas there were knife marks on the lower ribs.
they seem to be made by whatever instrument was used to remove the child after Carlie was dead.
Yup. I'm working on identifying it.
we might be able to use the child's most prominent genetic characteristics to see similarities with the mother.
can you input the information from the infant's skull to give us a face?
sure.
Yeah. Right away.
they've found Kyle Richardson.
got to wonder if he even cared, you know, finding out that his wife is dead.
he didn't kill her. - No, but he ran.
how do you just cut your family out of your life like that?
well, what about Abraham?
Oh, you're going to throw religion in my face right now?
I thought you found answers in what you believe.
I mean, that's just one Bible story that I just don't like.
I mean, God commands Abraham to kill his own son, and he does.
no, Abraham does not kill Isaac.
but old Abe, you know, he had theintention.
I thought what he had was faith.
look, I have faith, but if God himself came down, pointed at Parker and said, "I want you to...
you know? That ain't gonna happen.
well, God's messenger stopped Abraham?
Yeah. You know, grabbed his hand at the last second, right before the knife was about to go in.
okay, then the lesson I would learn from this myth...
myth?
well, it fits the definition. - Okay, fine.
that when it comes to your children, your love has to be absolute.
the messenger represents goodness, what you know to be right.
ergo, you have to remain open to what you know is true.
are you sure you're not religious?
science all the way.
science all the way.
Hey, even an empiricist can have a heart, Booth.
too bad Richardson doesn't.
just lock me up. I can't go through this anymore.
we know you didn't do it.
what?
evidence doesn't fit you.
then who was it? Who killed him?
you ran. Seems like you'd be the one who'd know.
I would have told someone if I knew.
right, cause, you know, you're such an honorable guy.
the knife, the rope, the sheeting-- it all came from your place, and why didn't you tell the police it was missing?
Oh. What, you check out what's in your garage every day?
if you didn't know anything, why'd you take off?
because I'm a bastard.
I'm a selfish, pathetic bastard, and everyone had already decided that I was guilty.
that's true, Booth. - Bones.
no wanted to find another suspect.
I kept on insisting.
thank you.
I didn't do it for you.
you are a pathetic bastard.
your wife was having your baby.
look, I did want to leave her, yeah.
I was out that night, trying to figure out how to tell her.
what with the baby and everything.
but for God sake, I didn't want them to die.
so, you have no idea who did this?
I should, shouldn't I?
I mean,
I ignored her for so long.
it's like this whole thing is my fault anyway.
you know, if I had been there that night, maybe they'd still be here.
we think your child might still be alive.
I-I don't understand. The bodies you found?
that wasn't your child.
whoever killed Carlie took your child and left theirs.
Oh, my God.
so, where's my kid?
we don't know.
Zack is working on the other knife mark.
I saw some staining in the groove it left, so I did some tests.
the stain is from Betadine.
it's an antiseptic used to prep patients for surgery.
Oh, someone was being really careful when they were cutting her up.
it was the baby they were concerned with.
were you able to get enough detail from the skull for a digital reconstruction?
Yeah. Since someone this young is still being formed, the, uh, features are generalized.
the last place I worked had a drunk sketch artist.
Wow.
it's a baby. It looks like every baby.
that's why I ran the reconstruction through an aging matrix.
it posits the most likely growth pattern the skull would follow.
now, as it ages, the features become more distinct.
by the time he's about ten, he shows very definite genetic characteristics.
don't eat that, honey.
Hey, there you go. There you go, there you go!
the mark on the ribs was from a scalpel.
the woman is a vet, so she has medical training, which also explains the Betadine.
look at her, huh? Playing with the kid.
okay.
miss Corbus?
I'm gonna have to ask you to hand us the child.
what? Why?
I think you know why.
no. You want me to give you my son? No.
he's not your son.
we know what happened.
he is. Robby is my son.
we have a warrant to take a DNA sample from you, Miss Corbus.
it'd be pretty hard to argue with that.
she didn't want him.
she told me she wished she had never gotten pregnant.
it was wrong for her to have him.
and killing your own child wasn't wrong?
that was a mistake. I am a single mother.
I'm alone. I just... I just wanted him to stop crying.
it was just... it was just a few seconds.
the doctor said I was sick, but I'm all better now.
I know, sweetie.
miss Corbus?
you can't take him from me. I'm a good mother.
you can ask anybody. I'm a good mother.
give us the child.
I'm a good mother.
Mary Corbus, you're under arrest for the murder and kidnapping of Carlie Richardson and the murder of your son Robert Corbus.
no, that's my Robbie, that's my Robbie.
Oh, my God!
I'm a good mother. I'm a good mother.
he's fine?
he's perfect.
and you're sure... - He's yours.
when I thought he was gone, and Carlie
I wished I could have changed how things had been.
don't you want to hold him?
I don't know, um...
the kind of guy I am...
I'm no father.
you don't get to decide that.
you have a son.
step up. Take him.
Hey.
thank you.
thank you.
so you think Richardson can rise to the occasion?
be a decent father?
he's got Carlie's parents to help him and I like to think that people can change.
faith and hope, right?
right.
Ange will throw in love, too.
love is good.
daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Parker! - Look what I did!
wow, look at that.
um, listen, you stay here with Dr. Brennan, okay?
I'm going to go talk to your mommy, all right?
all right?
so this is how it's got to go down.
I've got to meet your boyfriend with Parker here.
look, man, we're here because we want...
I'm talking to Rebecca.
look, this was Drew's idea.
and, you know, I told him it was going to be a bad one.
dad, look. - One second, bud.
Parker wanted you to see what he made for school.
and he kept saying how much he wanted us to meet.
and we'd be friends.
look, I got a kid I don't get to see much myself.
I know what it's like.
and I swear, the explosives were for work.
okay, look, look, look, look.
we are what we are.
and you can fight it if you want, but you're just going to fight with yourself.
maybe this isn't a good time.
maybe later.
no, no, it's a good time.
let me buy you a cup of coffee, all right?
let's go grab a seat. - Seriously?
Thanks, man.
that's okay, Bones, you can stay.
it's a family thing.
Bye, Parker.
Bye. - Bye.
all right, what do we got here, huh?
a diorama.
it's the zoo. Drew helped me.
the zoo? I hoped you thanked him.
he did. Yes, he did.
we gotta go to the zoo.
he knows all the animals.
all the animals?
Wow. Okay, well, maybe afterwards we could all go out to dinner if that's okay with your mom.
Yeah, that sounds good.
my dad knows a burger place.
I used to take him there after his T-ball games.
tell Drew about the burgers.
he says they're as big as my head.
as big as your head. We can all go.
we can even bring Stu...
my father worked as a lawyer for the richest family in new york until his plane went down in long island sound.
he left me his biggest client, the Darlings
Tripp, the empire builder, Letitia, the sophisticated socialite,
I want to marry Nick.
let me help you.
Brian, the man of god...
what about Brian jr?
I'm taking him back to Brazil.
you can't just uproot him.
he has a life here now.
Patrick, the principled politician...
the three of us are gonna sit down together and set some ground rules.
you, me and who?
and Jeremy and Juliet, the well-behaved twins.
I want a job.
what can you do?
gracias.
you will not believe the girl whose car I'm parking.
darling Plaza? was our first home in manhattan.
convince Tripp to throw Darling Plaza? into the pot.
it is simon elder.
he has stolen my son.
I want to destroy him.
good morning.
Hey.
you ready to paint the living room?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I love painting.
I love the mess, I love the smell.
okay, which one?
all right, let me see.
Yeah, it's a custard theme.
are you sure you're going to be able to finish this before thanksgiving at my parents'?
it's only two days.
Yeah.
Yeah, I have very little to do today.
I just have to meet with Tripp briefly and help Brian with his custody hearing, and then I am free for the entire holiday weekend.
five days without Nick George...
won't the Darling dynasty crumble into dust without you?
it just might.
but it would be very expensive dust.
anything going on with Darling Plaza??
not yet.
we transferred the deed over to simon elder two weeks ago.
he's given me no indication of his plans.
is that it, then?
he just wanted to steal my soul, rob me of...
the building where my kids were raised, rob me of my son?
my son, Nick.
have you heard from Patrick lately?
not since the wedding.
he hasn't returned any of my calls.
you can't imagine what it's like, Nicky.
you come tthe end of your life so many years of work, so many years of achievement and then right in front of your face, it's all being spirited away by this capricious man.
Patrick is still your son, Tripp.
no matter what kind of political alliance he forms with simon elder for whatever reason, he's still your son.
Yeah.
arrange a sit-down with Patrick and simon elder for me, will you?
a sit-down? Okay.
the sooner, the better.
tomorrow evening, up at valhalla.
wait, Tripp.
you expect him to leave the city the day before thanksgiving and go 60 miles up the hudson river valley for a sit-down?
you handed him the deed to Darling Plaza? to gain influence with him, right?
Yeah.
so use your influence.
cash it in.
all right. I'm on it.
you'll be there at my side, okay?
Tripp, it's-- it's thanksgiving weekend.
I made plans with the family.
I'll get you out really early thursday morning.
promise.
what do you want me to tell Patrick to just tell him simon elder will be there.
that'll make him feel safe.
you leave the rest up to his vanity.
how much longer are we gonna be staying at this hotel?
living out of a suitcase, eating room service all the time, it's a little tiresome.
thank you for being so patient.
have you set up the meeting with Carmelita yet?
I'm not sure this is the best time for her.
uh, she's got finals coming up.
Oh, she's in school.
what school?
uh, cosmetology.
well, it's always something, isn't it?
when would be a good time...
for her?
uh, wh-what is it you want to talk about?
just make it happen.
if you want to stay married to me, quit stalling and make it happen.
I-I understand -- today.
okay.
thank you for coming on such short notice, giorgio.
anytime you get divorced, karen, I'm here for you.
but, you know, we don't have to do this only after you get divorced.
Yeah, actually, we kinda do.
was that giorgio?
what a trooper, always being there for you like that.
it's really, like, inspiring.
mm, it takes a village.
something was off last night, though.
it wasn't the same.
do tell.
well, usually when giorgio and I have...
meaningless post-divorce sex, it feels a little less meaningless, like we're somehow...
planets whose orbits intersect every ten years?
no.
just...
hornier.
Oh, well.
you gonna eat those?
no.
replenish.
what's the matter with you?
I miss my son.
Brian jr. Left? Where'd he go?
his mother came and took him away a week ago, karen.
I'm fighting for custody.
Brian, hey, look, you-- you know how the justice system works.
whoever has the most money wins, right?
you've got nothing to worry about.
well, thanks for the advice.
thanks for the pancakes.
was Brian wearing clive christian number 1?
Nah, that's me.
and it's number 2, unreleased to the public.
why are you wearing cologne?
there's this girl who parks at the garage.
she won't go out with me.
she thinks I'm, like, just a valet.
Oh, so you're gonna knock her unconscious with your cologne, and then, what, shanghai her?
just tell her you're Jeremy Darling.
no.
Natalie pretended to be pregnant just to get my money.
I want this girl to like me for me.
honey, that's not gonna happen.
you're a Darling.
as soon as she finds that out, things are never gonna be the same, trust me.
I guess she can never find out then.
that is a good plan.
good plan, my friend.
he's not asking you to move back in.
he's not asking you to do anything except sit down with him and simon and talk.
well, Nick, that's the last thing on earth I would ever consider doing.
I know, but, Patrick, he is your father.
it's taken me over 30 years to--to muster the courage to break free from him.
I'm not about to go ruing back into shooting range.
okay.
but I'll do it.
I'll do it, okay?
I just need one...
little favor.
she just wants to talk.
I can't do it.
I can't face her.
I'm sorry.
tell Patrick no.
Carmelita, just put yourself in Ellen's shoes, just for a second.
she's not asking Patrick to end the affair.
she's not asking you to vanish.
she just wants to talk.
you know, who knows?
maybe the three of you can somehow, I don't know, complete each other.
you really think that's possible?
well, I think that life is very creative and surprising, and sometimes we find solutions where we thought there weren't any.
Patrick is so lucky to have someone like you in his life.
I'll do it.
good.
a sit-down?
that's what he called it.
wait.
and--and what are the terms?
Ah, no terms.
well, because it sounds so old-world, I figured there must be terms.
Nope, just the three of you sitting down to talk, and me.
okay, does this have anything to do with Darling Plaza??
I don't think so I think it has to do with the fact he feels he's lost his son to you.
that's what he's troubled about right now.
okay, so you're being straight with me about this little...
sit-down?
you promise me that I'm not gonna be walking into some sort of classic Tripp Darling ambush?
uh, yeah, I promise.
Yeah. Okay.
I'll go.
actually, I think it could be beneficial.
good.
it's not every day two men like us sit down and break bread together.
it should be interesting.
done.
the Country House
I think we can all agree it's in everyone's best interest to settle this without going to the judge tomorrow.
what you think, Mr. George, is aside the point.
my client's settling for nothing less than sole physical and legal custody.
are you out of your freaking mind?
I know what's best for my child.
says the tramp who slept with me last week to get him back.
Brian, let me handle this.
then handle it!
given Brian jr.'s feelings for his father, do you think that moving to brazil is really what's best for him?
these two have bonded since you first deposited your son with Brian and then subsequently disappeared.
was this before or after he deposited the child with you?
beat it, you prissy little creep.
Brian, let's just cool it. Okay?
let's just stop.
I think I have come up with what is a very fair proposal for joint custody.
you will be wellompensated provided you stay in the city, and it puts your son's best interests first.
I'll give you $1 million to get up and walk out of here right now.
excuse me?
Hey, that's not what we're here to do, Brian.
let me finish.
$2 million.
are you trying to buy my son?
I'm trying to buy our son.
nobody is buying anybody.
this is ridiculous.
we're leaving.
$3 million.
we both know it's all about the money with you anyway.
now I remember why it didn't work with us.
you are not a human being.
don't look at me like that.
$3 million was more than fair.
Hey.
Hey.
how you doing, baby?
this better not be your way of saying you're missing thanksgiving.
I am not missing thanksgiving.
good.
I just have to postpone the painting until the weekend.
and I'm gonna catch up with you and Kiki at your parents'.
I have to go up to the Darlings' country house tomorrow.
Tripp is having a sit-down with Patrick and simon elder.
he wants me there.
I'm sorry.
you know what? It's okay.
okay.
Yeah, I knew you wouldn't get to it, so maybe I'll start painting, cause I'd like it done before the holidays.
because, you know, I actually care.
Hey, lisa, you know what?
why don't you come with me.
we'll--we'll drop Kiki off at your folks' first, and then this weekend, we'll all paint together.
I am not going to stay in the same house as the Darlings.
italy was bad enough.
Oh, come on, Lisa.
I am not gonna stay the night at the same place you and Karen Darling spent a dozen magical summers together.
you know what?
how about you go, you enjoy a nice, long weekend with her, and I will stay here and I will paint?
Lisa, I don't particularly want to go, but I have to.
and since I have to, I would like you to come with me.
coming right up.
actually...
is it possible to leave my car here overnight?
I think I drank a little too much wine atinner.
I'm so on board with that.
you know, both myself and the garage encourage responsible, yet heavy drinking.
okay, wonderful.
thank you.
I'll just go and take a catnap.
let me...
let me help you out there.
what do you got going on in there?
french fries with truffle oil.
you know, I-I could just drive you home.
that way--that way you have your car in the morning.
I don't think so.
come on.
I'll cab it home.
no muss, no fuss.
in and out.
boom.
that's so sweet of you.
it would help me out a lot.
well, I will--I will-- I will go fetch your chariot.
why do I have to come to Valhalla for thanksgiving?
Brian's not gonna be there.
your brother Brian has a custody hearing.
he's presiding over two funerals this weekend.
the holiday season die-off has commenced.
uh, I-I told you I'd help you with Nick.
so trust me.
just come.
what if daddy sends me and Nick to India-- or, no, wait, Bali-- to set up an orphanage for the really starving children?
and we'd have to live alone in a grass hut on the beach.
well, as wonderful as that sounds, coming to Valhalla is all you really need to do.
but she'll be there.
won't she?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Oh, she will.
of course she will.
she's his wife.
it's so her to come along, isn't it?
just relax, my dear.
everything is gonna work itself out.
door-to-door service with a smile.
thank you for this.
boy, Brooklyn is, uh, far away.
I mean--I mean, I-I forgot how far it is.
it's like...
it's like a whole other world.
are you gonna be all right getting home?
Yeah, yeah, like I said, I'll--I'll call a cab.
maybe I'll hobo and hop a boxcar.
the subway is two blocks away.
right, yeah.
the--the subway.
there you go.
listen, Sofia...
the answer is yes.
to what?
I will go out with you.
but I don't even know your last name.
well--well, I-I don't-- I don't even know your last name.
I'm Sofia Montoya, and you're Jeremy...
I'm cool with just Jeremy, babe.
Yeah, well, you know, it's a-- it's a common american last name.
it's right on all those lists beside Smith Wong and White.
well, thank you and I'll see you tomorrow, Jeremy...
Yes.
Yes, you will.
Hey, hey, Clark, um, do you mind coming to get me?
I am, uh, I am...
somewhere in Brooklyn.
you're sure about this, right?
what are you gonna do, not answer the door?
well...
isn't this something?
I've heard a lot about you.
I wish I could say the same.
unfortunately, I've been kept completely in the dark.
I have, too, in a sense.
come in.
please.
you can have one saturday night a month, but the rest of the weekends are ours.
you can have one tuesday or wednesday night every other week to do whatever it is that the two of you do as long as he is home in time to put the kids to bed before he does it.
this's less than I get him now, so why exactly would I do this?
because it's more than you'll ever have otherwise.
trust me.
starting now, this is the new normal.
Sweetheart...are you sure you want to please, Pat, stay out of it.
don't you think I should participate in this conversation?
Patrick, maybe you should take a walk.
okay.
okay.
he'll spend holidays with us, family birthdays and obviously all campaign-related events are completely off-limits.
the only way that this is gonna work is if I get him two nights every week.
or Patrick's gonna end up sneaking out, and neither one of us wants that, do we?
family is the only thing that matters to me.
and as the arbitrator in this case, I'm sure you can appreciate that.
and that's why I believe, as a father and a minister, that I should share custody with Brian jr.
and she should not be able to whisk him away to frigging Brazil.
thank you, reverend Darling, for your forthrightness.
Mr. Mitchell?
Reverend Darling, who is Gustav?
go ahead, tell him.
Gustav is my, uh, pet name for Brian jr.
it's a Nickname, kind of.
nickname, really?
Yeah.
it's a rather unremarkable occurrence between a father and son.
is it true you forced Brian jr.
to lie to your wife and pretend he was a swedish orphan whose parents died in a car accident?
no.
no?
it was a bullet train accident, not a car.
get your facts straight.
but you did make him lie.
no.
I offered him an opportunity to work with me to smooth the way towards building a new family structure by soft-pedaling, as it were, the nature of his involvement with me, and by making it a fun game.
isn't it also true, reverend Darling, that you kept Brian jr. On a diet of swedish foods, including fermented milk and reindeer?
it was once.
it was a 1-day thing.
and didn't you forbid him to tell the truth to your wife until he was so paralyzed by fear and guilt of hellfire and damnation that he had to confess the truth himself?
I need help.
I've got this little romantic rendezvous tonight, and, uh, I -- I was wondering if you could hook me up with a place to eat.
a restaurant?
this girl I like, she doesn't know who I am.
you know, she thinks I'm this normal parking attendant, and, uh, you know, I just-- I-I wanna keep it that way.
so...
W-where--where do people like you go out?
people like me?
Yeah, you know, like poor--poor people.
Where--where do you eat when you go out?
you know, Jeremy, I actually make a pretty decent living working for your family.
I've--I've seen you eating your bag lunch, and, you know, I don't know what's going on with the whole silent-movie-star moustache, but it seems pretty...poverty-related.
you're right, Jeremy.
I...
can't actually afford a beard.
that's a good one.
in the interest of full poor disclosure, uh, maureen and I do enjoy, occasionally, going out for pizza or a walk down the Brooklyn promenade.
that--that's sweet and simple.
I like it.
sometimes, after, we'll take a bottle of wine up on the roof and...
if the stars are out and the mood hits us, well...
you know us poor people.
you do the deed alfresco?
Yep.
Clarksdale!
you're like the--the fountain of middle class romance-formation.
I been called that before.
you should prepare yourself, Brian.
we may lose.
do you think?
you're the worst.
did you even go to law school?
what did you want me to do?
you've lied about this kid from day one, Brian, and everybody knows it.
I'm sorry I can't change reality.
well, then you suck.
I had a plan, and you sabotaged me every step of the way.
just go out there and--and get them back in here and get a retrial or a mistrial or something.
this isn't a trial.
the arbitrator makes her recommendation to the judge based on testimony, and your little performance in here didn't help.
the fact is, Andrea raised Brian for seven years, and you had him for two months.
and you made him pretend to be swedish.
so why don't you let me worry about the law?
go see Andrea alone, reason with her, make her understand how you feel about Brian.
she's his mother.
she wants him to be happy.
good luck.
Hey. What are you doing?
Hey.
I don't think there is an article of clothing kiki owns that she is not taking with her.
taking where?
to my parents'.
we'll drop her off.
I'm going with you to the country house.
you decided to come with me?
Mm-hmm.
you sure?
Yes.
I am not going to let the Darling drama rob me of a chance to breathe some clean air with my husband.
good.
Yeah, and they only use it, like, four times a year.
buon giorno, cari.
Oh, leave those.
Albert will get them.
told you she'd come.
it'll be fine.
told you she'd come.
it'll be fine.
Hi, dear.
Hi, Lisa.
lovely to have you here.
would you look at that?
here we go.
Oh, hello.
well, you must be Simon.
it is a pleasure to meet you.
Hello, mother.
great to see you.
Simon, how are you? This is my wife Lisa.
and this is Karen Darling.
Hi.
the Karen?
Yes.
I'm sure everybody could use a little drinky-poo.
Hey, you're just in time.
so what are we hunting?
quail.
might get a pheasant or two.
this late in the season?
sure.
you're not planning on shooting him, are you?
come on, Nick.
you know me better than that.
everything's just terrific, mother.
thank you.
you're not liking that qua?
I'm all for sport hunting and responsible wildlife management, but actually...
I don't eat meat.
Oh, but that's all the yummy stuff.
do you eat anything yummy?
down, girl.
shut up.
well, we can have them cook you something else.
there's trout.
no, no, no, the salad is enough.
everything's wonderful.
thank you.
Lisa, you must come with me after dinner to the east wing.
I've been meaning to show you something.
a little art collection.
okay.
sounds great.
it's an hour-and-a-half wait.
should we just go?
Nah, let me see what I can do.
Jeremy, it's okay.
no, no, hold on.
I can be charming.
excuse me.
could you please double-check about a table for two?
actually, it looks like I might have a table, Mr. Darling.
one more thing.
should just be a few.
Really?
Babeson, party of two?
you got us a table.
I told a teeny lie.
happy birthday to you that was so embarrassing.
my birthday is in march.
it was the only way I could get a table.
just, you know, pretend.
I'm having a great time tonight.
me, too.
you know, it's, uh, kinda nice going out on a normal date.
and how does this normal date ends?
how about a walk on the promenade?
how about we go back to your place?
uh, that--that is-- that is a much better idea.
except I can't.
I-I got a friend crashing at my place for thanksgiving tomorrow.
you know, he--he's, uh, he's a little down on his luck, kinda poor, so...
too bad.
there is another option.
isn't there some way that we can...
work something out, just between us?
Brian, it's too late for that.
when that arbitrator delivers her recommendation to the judge, it's all over, and I'll abide by that.
well, of course you will, cause it's all gonna go your way.
not his and not mine, yours.
Brian, that first day that I met you at church, you sat and talked with me for hours about faith and solace.
Yeah, so what about it?
so you are the one who taught me to bring my problems in life to god.
have you thought about doing that?
I-I know this whole get-together may seem a little old-fashioned, but...
I thought it was time to cut through the haze of go-betweens and talk in person.
Hey, I couldn't agree more.
I'm glad you came.
thank you.
as long as everything's moving forward, dad, I'm happy.
no hard feelings.
so...
what are you doing with my son?
doing?
what?
no, what is the nature of your alliance?
h-hold on a second.
are you kidding?
this is none of your business anymore, dad.
you don't have to answer that.
no, no, no, I'm happy to.
I'm ecstatic.
I've--I've simply offered myself to Patrick as an advisor and a--and a friend during this time of transition.
so you're not using him as a pawn to enact revenge against me, huh?
um, I think...
that Patrick's pedree combined with his passion for social justice is going to make him a very effective senator.
I'm excited to be on his team, that's all.
dad, try not to make a fool of yourself, okay?
what's this all about, Tripp?
it's about the chilling heartlessness of a man determined to tear asunder the long-standing family ties in the course of his vendetta.
do you want to tell them why you want to destroy my family, or shall I?
you know, Lisa, I,um...
I've been meaning to apologize to you, but I-I keep putting it off.
you know, for the wedding, for Karen's...behavior.
she can be so rash and thoughtless sometimes.
and I-I know how proud she is, and she'd never come to you herself.
what are you talking about?
you present yourself as a-- some sort of modern-day saint.
but that's not who you are at all.
you're not motivated by benevolence.
you're driven from your very core by an obsessive malevolence against me and my family
I-I've gotta get going.
paddy, hear this out.
Tripp, none of this is personal.
it's business.
so...
your family's history with my family has nothing to do with it?
what are you--what are you talking about, Tripp?
I didn't know what his real name was before.
but as soon as I found out, everything fell into place.
his parents used to work for our family, for a long time.
do you want to continue, or shall I?
what happened?
Oh, it--it was nothing, really.
I'm sorry.
I, uh...
well, I-I assumed you knew.
you and Karen have been so chilly that -- wh-what happened?
I would love to hear what you think you know.
your father was my mother's lover.
well, that was the rumor, and my father couldn't live with those rumors, true or false, so he dismissed his parents, and they fled to the soviet union with the belief that communism spoke more clearly to the plight of african-americans.
but it wasn't so rosy over there, was it?
his family ended up in a siberian work camp, and they died there, leaving you an orphan.
is that true?
it touches on the truth.
well...
you know, Karen was in a bit of a depression, you know, post-divorce, and a little intoxicated, and she...
well, she apparently kissed Nick and declared her undying love for him.
she can be so impulsive.
no, it is the truth.
and it's the truth that you hold me personally responsible for the death of your parents.
see, I don't need some desiccated old man to tell me my history.
Siccated?
especially one who gets it all wrong.
my parents didn't go to Russia by choice.
your family forced them there.
Oh, no. You've got it all wrong.
I'm not dried meat, and your parents were not deported from this country, and you know it.
no, no.
but once their names had been handed over to the state department, they were, for all intents and purposes, hounded out of this country, so, yeah, their deaths lie at the feet of your family, completely.
all right, I've heard enough.
look, I don't know who's telling the truth here, okay?
but the fact that you lured all of us up here for this little performance of yours and then get everyone else involved with your game, that arrogance is precisely why I stopped trusting you years ago, and why I will never trust you again.
do you understand?
if you see Ellen, tell her I've gone out.
I'll head home as well.
I wish this had ended differently.
well, it ended exactly as I expected it to end, with a crafty denial.
night, Tripp.
good night.
well, at least it's out there for everyone to know.
excuse me.
it's so sick.
you told me this wasn't an ambush.
I didn't know anything about it.
you need to stop lying to me.
I will not be played.
no one is playing you.
if that fossil wants a war, that's exactly what he'll get.
that's what you'll both get.
Simon, this was all Tripp.
I had nothing too with it.
that's the truth.
the tru--oh, the truth.
Oh, the truth is pretty malleable around here.
all right, all right.
all right.
just...
listen, if we're gonna go any further, I need to know one last time whether you're with me or not.
well, if all you're doing is exacting revenge, then no, I'm not.
Nick, I'm not exacting revenge.
but Tripp Darling owning half the city is not good for the people of new york.
he is a dangerous man.
look, I know that Tripp has made some shady business deals, but dangerous?
Yes.
do you remember Kenneth Darling, Tripp's brother?
Simon, come on.
the only people who think that Tripp had anything to do with Kenneth Darling's assassination are crackpot conspiracy theorists on the internet and two people who are actually suspects in the killing, both of whom have since been completely discredited.
Yeah, you're-- you're probably right.
because bad things don't really happen.
it's all just a story.
right?
Where's Nick?
I'm not sure.
scotch?
Uh-oh.
it's empty.
sorry.
were you this drunk when you kissed my husband and told him that you loved him at your wedding?
actually, no.
I was sober, and so was he.
Hey, there you are.
be careful.
she just found out about our kiss at the wedding.
it was not "our kiss," Karen.
unbelievable.
you are unbelievable.
why do you do that?
I didn't tell her, Nick.
I thought it was gonna be our little secret.
how did you think to come up to this place?
Oh, my dad works for them.
uh, he told me they're all out of town, so...
so what does Mr. Babeson do?
who?
your dad, silly. Mr. Babeson.
Oh, right.
um, he-- he's the limo driver for this family, the Darlings.
you've never heard of them?
no, should I have?
no, no.
you-- no, you absolutely shouldn't have.
you know what's so amazing about you?
what?
being with you...
I-I feel like it doesn't matter how much money I have or don't have.
it's like it's just ycoou and me, you know?
dear god...
I don't ask you for much.
Well,'cause I know I don't deserve much.
but please help the arbitrator to understand that I love my son.
I'm so sorry.
and please give her the good sense...
I think this is yours.
no, it fell out of your-- from reverend Darling.
to accept my generous donation.
thank you.
Amen.
so you're just gonna leave right now?
I'm going to my parents' house.
I need some time to regroup.
Lisa, the only reason that I didn't tell you was that I didn't want to waste our time arguing over nothing.
it was basically a-- a peck on the cheek-- her lips, my cheek.
how many times does she have to kiss you before you put a stop to it?
I can't control what Karen does.
is that going to be your excuse when you two sleep together?
she's delusional, Lisa.
I've told her over and over there will never be anything between us.
but she lives in this world where she thinks she can have anything she wants.
Yeah, well, there is a pattern here, Nick.
and for the first time, I feel like you are taking part in it, whether you believe it or not.
you know what? I have been pissed offt karen, but I have never worried about you.
now I am.
Hey, baby.
what are you working on?
you went to see her, didn't you?
wheris she?
I-in a motel...
a few miles from here.
could you at least take a shower?
w-we didn't...
do anything.
it just--I...
look, it's been a rough night, and I-I needed to talk to someone.
I...
I can...
I can tell her things.
What--I...
Simon left so abruptly.
how was the meeting?
ultimately?
Wearying.
sometimes I think I'm almost ready to leave, you know...
this life.
I'm glad I married you.
I'm glad I married you.
what theell was that?
so this was not an assassination attempt on Patrick Darling?
no, this was a simple, run-of-the-mill hunting accident.
where are the wounds?
Mr. Darling sustained injuries-- minor injuries--to his leg, and he is expected to make a full and speedy recovery.
who shot him?
nobody shot him, per se.
this was an accident.
fine.
who pulled the trigger?
Charlie mickelson--a longtime Darling family friend.
he is devastated the incident, and we obviously request that you respect his privacy.
where is Ellen Darling?
why hasn't she been here to see him?
Ellen is resting at the imperial, and she's also quite devastated.
and we all hope that we can just put this unfortunate episode behind us and enjoy the holiday as best we can.
why was the attorney general hunting at night?
no further questions.
looking forward to the turkey festivities this evening?
I am, I am.
I, uh, don't know how festive it's gonna be with Patrick's leg in a sling, but I finally have something to be thankful for.
let's go, clark.
I didn't--I didn't know you were gonna be here today.
you know, the-- thanksgiving and all.
what's all this?
uh, th-this? This is oh, of course. That's your father.
how sweet of him to pick you up from your work.
Yeah, he is-- he is the sweetest.
you--you are--you-- thank you.
thank you, pops.
what the hell's going on here?
be cool, Clark.
just know you're my father and our last name is babeson.
got it.
this is my dad.
Ah, Babesons don't shake.
Babesons hug.
okay.
how are you?
I'm good.
thank you for doing this, Charlie.
happy to help out, Tripp.
what did I shoot him with again?
double-barreled shotgun.
purdy, 20-gauge, birdshot-- both barrels.
right.
happy thanksgiving.
you, too.
tell Helen we'd love to see you sometime.
will do.
thank you.
you bet.
how's Patrick doing?
doped up on sedatives.
Ellen?
also doped up on sedatives.
you know, this could be...
well, you know...
I mean, it's not going to get out, s it?
I'm just thinking of Patrick's campaign.
shouldn't be a problem.
he's my son.
you okay?
I said I'd never lie for the family, and all of a sudden I'm making up stories for the press about hunting accidents.
doesn't seem like a step in the right direction.
hey...
you told dutch you were too busy to see him, and you weren't.
come on.
come on, Nick.
life's messy.
why didn't you tell me that elder's parents worked for the family?
the whole point of this is for him to trust me.
I didn't want to put you in a position where you would have to lie.
and I could not take a chance that his faith in you would be in any way diminished.
so all that was true, about elder's parents?
Yeah.
I-I mean, he got it wrong about my parents reporting his parentto the authorities.
that wasn't them.
it was my father.
Yeah.
that was dutch my dad, he was-- he was fit to be tied.
if he'd had his way...
I mean, you know, it was the 50s.
they were different times.
dutch got into it, got them safely put on a boat to russia.
you know...
if you're looking for a motive for...
who killed your dad, I mean, if Simon Elder knew that it was dutch who did that...
what?
isn't that Darling Plaza??
Oh, god.
that's the third time I've seen it today.
it doesn't get any easier.
darling Plaza? was demolished today as part of billionaire Simon Elder's redevelopment plan for a new, greener manhattan.
according to the demolition team, the 15-story building...
there is nothing that that man is not capable of doing...
caused minor delays in the morning commute.
I was hoping it'd be you.
happy thanksgiving.
such as it is.
I'm sorry I left, Nick, but sometimes it is really hard to deal with this whole situation.
well, I'll quit.
why don't I-- why don't I quit?
I don't want you to quit.
I feel like you're slipping away, like things are just spiraling out of control, for--for both of us.
why don't I drive up there right now?
no.
we're just about to sit down and eat.
just take the night, relax.
we'll still be here tomorrow.
all right.
well, I'll drive up in the morning.
I love you, Nick.
and I'm...
I'm really--I'm trying.
you know that, right?
Yeah, I know.
I'm trying, too, lise.
we'll get through this.
I know we will.
all right.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I just want to go.
it's okay.
what special talents do you have that the Company might make the decision that you are worth more to them alive than dead?
be careful, Alex.
they will be buried here.
were you able to find my book? Yeah.
but there was this guy.
he took it.
he said to tell you that Scofield's brother has it now.
you have to break them out of there.
Sara!
you're never going to try anything like that again.
but just to make sure,
I left you a little something in the garage.
what's so interesting out there, other than our freedom?
finds are alive, so the fence is dead.
yeah? Everyone in here knows is that fence doesn't work, and it doesn't mean a bloody thing, because there are soldiers out there that'll shoot you dead before you get within 30 yards of it.
well, I guess I got a lot of work to do, don't I?
listen, mate, I get what you're doing with my book.
they hold your girlfriend, you hold what they want.
countering needs. Churchill 101.
soon those bastards are going to ask me what progress I've made in figuring out what they want, and I'm going to say nil, 'cause Lincoln Burrows has the book.
you know what?
threatening the brother of the guy who's supposed to get you out of here might not be the smartest move.
I'm not threatening-- we're on the same team.
but if we play games with that book, people who want me out of here will take ac "I never worry about action, only inaction."
Churchill 101.
now, like I said, I got a lot of work to do.
Linc, you all right?
I'm sorry, man.
just all this stuff-- it's starting to get to me.
you know?
listen, our situation could change very, very soon.
the grave digger for the prison.
I need you to reach out to him.
and tell him what?
it's all written down.
but we got to get started now.
what are you not telling me?
all these people that have been hurt because of me.
I'm so sorry, Michael.
they did this, not you.
okay?
it's not your fault.
just get to the grave digger.
I feel like we're running out of time.
Sara.
I am just a soldier in this war, Lincoln, just like you.
I did not want to do that.
can you even comprehend the intimacy of the mechanics of what I had to do to that woman?
it's horrible!
now, if you and your brother are done playing games,
LJ will be fine.
if not, the last thing I want to do.
but if you push me, eces of him to you.
and not even that far, I will.
I'll do anything you want.
just don't hurt my son.
that's really up to you.
I know the past few days have been hard, for me, as well.
if you want to talk about it,
I know what this pain feels like.
I just want to get your boy out of Sona and get my son back.
Michael's got a plan.
I need details.
we need to bring someone who works at the prison onto the team.
who?
the grave digger.
get it done.
lincoln, I'm going to need that book.
the Company did handwriting analysis on the one you gave me, and yours hasn't changed since high school.
just soldiers, Linc.
different armies, but soldiers just the same.
nice.
I was the best in my school.
all girls?
kiss my ass, bro.
20 bucks says you can't do that again.
bet. Wait.
adjust for wind.
shut up.
just a bit outside.
Hey, bro, you know I don't have that kind of verde lying around.
it's going to take a while.
well, the thing is, I don't have a while.
so, unless... No, no more favors.
all right.
can I borrow that cross of yours?
I'll take it in trade. My dad gave me this.
besides, it's not even real gold.
that's why I need it.
look, I'll give it back, okay?
it's just a loan.
come on.
this time, I want to know why.
it's light again.
someone's getting fat off of everythg I built while I rot in here.
don't get upset.
I only have a few more hours.
let's be nice.
this motherless bitch.
Alex?
you just get here?
Yes.
listen,
I've been thinking about and, uh, you're in.
I'm in.
okay.
just like that? Right.
I really don't have a choice, do I?
what's the plan?
I'm working on it.
meanwhile, I could use your help.
what do you need?
a black felt-tipped pen.
a pen? Yeah.
Why? Some documents that need altering.
I'll explain it to you later, but right now, I need that pen.
okay? Yeah.
and I'll tell you what else I need.
I need you to get your act together.
I need you to bring yourself under control, because you're attracting attention, and that we don't need.
I'm under control.
of course you are.
this is what happens when a system is overloaded.
see? Look.
son of a... Power is out.
fix it.
I'm a truck driver.
Hey, Alex.
Hey, glad I found ya. Just wanted to see how you're holding up in here. Just dandy.
Yeah, well, I've been having a tough time of it myself.
and I was figuring shouldn't be that way for us, seeing as how we're the only lawmen here in Taco Hell.
Hey, whoa, hang on a second there, Alex.
you and me-- we were a team on the outside, remember?
I was your dog, and I still got a lot of bark left in me.
I'm busy, Brad. What do you want?
you and Scofield-- you're up to something, right?
you can tell me, one badge to another.
I can help.
do you have a black felt-tipped pen?
not on me.
then you can't help me.
I know.
you know what?
I know you're trying to escape from here with that man, Scofield.
sweetheart... Please, don't lie to me.
Lincoln Burrows, he told me everything.
there are some very powerful people that want me out of here.
and they want those brothers to get me out. Why?
I'm not sure.
has something to do with a charter I did in Seattle.
what I do know is their end game is exa the same as ours, and that's me out of this hellhole.
and once that happens, you and I will disappear... forever.
but I don't want to involve you in this mess.
I want to help.
that's way too dangerous.
I'm not asking your permission, James.
I'm telling you.
I can do this on my own, or you can tell me what you know and we can work it through together.
I don't understand everything that's going on, but these brothers, they're obviously trying to find out what they can about me.
let's see what we can discover about them.
find out what their plan is, see what they're all about.
they're trying to get you out, and you don't trust them?
I don't trust any of these guys.
and yoshouldn't, either.
if you insist on getting into this, promise me you'll be careful.
because God knows I will die if anything happens to you.
Hey.
Michael.
here.
I said I need a black felt-tipped pen.
that's black.
it's not what I need.
keep looking.
he's playing you.
he's playing you.
do not trust him.
your amigo, the American.
he's a builder, an engineer, no?
he's no amigo of mine, boss.
and trust me, you do not want to get under the covers with that...
is he or is he not an engineer?
well, yeah, but...
Scofield.
yeah?
what do you know about the electricity?
only that we don't have any right now.
let me tell you something.
this phone keeps all the food coming to the gate.
it keeps my business running, it keeps Sona running.
electricity die, phone die.
phone die, we die. We die or you die?
boy, you have enough education, but you're not being smart.
now, I come to you, that is an opportunity.
be wise and take advantage.
now, can you fix the electricity just like you fixed the water?
it's not that simple.
the water pipes are inside the prison.
the electrical lines are probably running underground along an exterior wall, which means they're out there somewhere in no-man's-land.
so, you can fix the power?
last I checked, they shoot prisoners who go out there.
so I'm thinking the answer is "no."
you listen to me, and you listen closely, water boy.
like it or not, soldiers or not, you're going out into no-man's-land.
it's a suicide mission.
I'll make some calls.
and you're going to keep meafe? As best I can.
I don't think I can do this.
no, no, no, no, no. You will help me with this.
look, I will do something for you.
I'll get you a new pillow, goose-feather like mine, or a small TV.
all right.
get me that.
Why? It's the first one to get sunlight in the morning.
you get me that cell, I'll get you electricity.
Hey, Linc.
look, bro, um, I'm going to be out of your way real soon.
I saw these flyers for migrant workers in Colombia.
it's coffee bean season, and they're letting Panamanians in, so I figure, with a good ID, I can pass.
bus leaves today, okay?
all right, well, before you get out of here, man, I...
I'm meeting someone, and I need a translator.
Linc, uh... I appreciate everything you've done...
it'll just be a couple hours.
just a couple hours, that's it.
when I was 15, my cousin told me about a job that only lasts a few hours and, uh, I got three months in juvie.
I can't do this without you.
I'm in Panama, I don't speak the language...
and I can't miss that bus.
I'm going ake money and send it home.
underground or not, I'm going to be a dad, Linc, and you out of all people should understand that.
I spoke to James.
he confirmed what you told me about the escape.
you and I, we both have people in there we care about.
please... let me help you.
your Spanish as good as your English?
Yes, Colonel.
I just have one favor to ask.
it's just outside of the gate.
you, you can bring your men.
the phone dying.
make him one.
this is it?
not everyone has it yet.
we let credit go a week, and there is still time.
the money's in your veins.
no. I don't use anymore. I swear to you.
I swear to you. No.
I swear to you. I swear to you.
chin up, pal o' mine, Chin up.
Colonel.
Yes, thank you, Colonel.
we'll be right there.
come with me.
excuse me. Do you, um...
do you have a-a, a pen?
pen. Not, um...
not... not the brush but the pen. Pen. Pen.
no, pintura.
Yeah, yeah, pintura. Yeah.
he's leaving you.
he's leaving you, he'll be gone, and you'll be stuck in this maze... forever.
thank you for arranging this for us, Colonel.
I'm getting something out of this as well,
I assure you.
you know you can fix this electric problem?
I won't know for sure until we can start digging, but yes, I think so.
my men will shoot you in t back of the head if you so much as look at the fence, eh?
and you, if anything goes wrong.
it will not only be his life that is lost.
you have my word on that.
no worries, Colonel.
I'll keep this boy in line.
I'll dig.
I don't need your help.
Hey, come on, now, don't be proud.
I heard you talking just yesterday.
talking to Mahone.
you know, about how us Americans should stick together.
help me down the road, right, Mike?
what is it, a '66 or a '67?
Erdon? Your car.
66.0
Uh-huh. What is it, 325 horses?
375
375
what's he saying? Recognizes me, but he doesn't realize it was at the prison.
ask him does he want to make enough cash to get this car cherry by next week?
he knows we're not talking about cars.
that's right.
come on, Scofield, I know you're getting out of here.
I heard it all about you and the limey.
I'm just fixing the electricity, Boss.
Yeah, right, and I'm just single cause I'm choosy.
don't make me tell anyone what I know.
what is it you think you know?
somebody called "the Company" wanted you in here to work with that Whistler guy.
am I warm? What's the Company?
what do they want with Whistler?
I don't know, but you do.
doesn't sound like you know much after all.
I don't need to know how to change a diaper to know when it stinks to high hell.
you're doing something here, Scofield.
you're right. I am.
I'm fixing the electricity.
now, you wanted to help dig?
dig.
Hey, this is it.
I assume we're doing more than just than playing electrician.
don't worry.
we're exactly where we need to be.
heat's getting to me, Scofield.
it's quitting time.
you mind telling me why he's even out here with us?
he knows something's up.
how the hell does he know that?
let's just say I have a bit of a rep.
from Fox River?
I know who you are, mate.
figured it out just lately.
finally made sense why they pick you of all people to send here.
no worries.
it's in my interest to keep your little secret.
but Bellick?
can't be trusted.
I can handle Bellick.
he's not in on this.
okay, good.
but Mahone is.
Mahone?
he's looking abouts stable as a three-legged chair, and he's escaping with us?
no, he just thinks he is.
he needs his meds.
without them, he'll self destruct.
it's just a matter of time.
and if he doesn't?
I'll string him along, tell him what he wants to hear, and then I'll cut him loose.
how do I know you're not going to do the same thing to me?
you don't.
you need a hook-up, my friend?
no.
take your time.
I don't hard sell.
my pduct speaks for itself.
outside, I took something.
it's a prescription drug called Varatril, and I was wondering if you...
this ain't no farmacia.
but what I got right here...
it's bter than anything your doctor gave you back in the States.
that's tar.
just take a taste.
you know, keep it in check.
I don't have any money right now.
then I don't have any drugs.
but there are a few ways for a man to make a few dollars in Sona...
servicing the needs of others
not something I'm into...
you think I'm a punk?
I'm just helping you get well, friend, just helping you get well.
ser Lechero?
what do you want?
look, I know you're a busy man, but I wanted to tell ya,
I don't know exactly what he's doing, but Michael Scofield's taking you for a ride. No,
I don't think so.
listen, I heard him talking about escape yesterday
about breaking outta here. It's he's talking about escape, why are you here telling me and you're not going with him, eh?
I would if he'd let me, but he's already cut me out.
he says he's square, but I know the son of a bitch is up to something.
so I figured, if I ain't running, I might asl tell you and make my time in here a little bit easier.
every man fantasizes about escaping from Sona.
Yeah, but they aren't all in no-man's-land with shovels.
I'm gave him the shovels. Get him out.
I gave him shovels too, and guys to work with, just like you.
I worked in the prison he broke out of.
he said he was doing me a favor
fixing damage from a fire he started.
and you know what I got?
hog-tied and left in a pipe under my own prison.
there's nothing he can do.
the soldiers are watching him.
that's what I thought, until he tunneled out ofy guard's room.
he's buried something in a junction box out there and covered it with dirt-- I saw him.
go see for yourself.
if I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.
trouble keeps finding you here in Sona, doesn't it?
let's take a walk, eh?
there are rumors about that you are trying to trick me.
I'm just doing what I'm told.
Oh? Let's hope for your sake that's true.
Hmm?!
but just make sure, let's go on out to no-man's-land and see what you buried there.
just want to make sure my men are doing a good job for the colonel.
get in there.
get in there.
open it.
move the dirt.
now!
it's duct tape.
to fix the frayed wires.
that's why the power was so inconsistent.
I didn't want the tape to come loose, so I packed it down with dirt.
beautiful.
where are you going?
I got to turn the main power switch back on.
I had to turn it off, so we could work on the wires safely.
I'll come with you.
it's just a switch.
I can handle it myself.
you can... but you won't.
Hey, water boy, it's back here.
I don't need the chain, just the cross.
it's the perfect size and it's not real gold, so it won't conduct current.
keep the circuit open
no power even when the main switch is turned on.
take the cross out...
Sona lights up again.
Lechero find out you messed with his electric...
you're dead.
that's why he can't ever find out.
now, don't make me come get you.
nobody back there can help you.
uh, it's...
it's some kind of mistake.
it should be working.
the only mistake I made was trusting you.
transformer delay.
it's an old prison.
now, if you don't mind...
I'd like to move into my new cell.
thank you for your words before, blanco.
working for Lechero, not an easy field to plow, comprende?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I comprend.
you and me, we're amigos, Nieves.
when Lechero is in a better mood,
I'm going to put in a goodord, help you, how you say,"move up the ladder."
I appreciate it, compadre, but I was always taught that God helps those that help themselves.
$15, 000...
Why? Because that's what he wanted.
relax. I'll get you the money.
and I will meet you there. Okay.
how are you holding up?
I just want to get this done.
good.
stay here.
I'm coming with you. Stay here.
you expect me to stay here and wait? I don't care what you do.
you don't care? Who the hell are you to say you don't care?
you're not the only one affected by this.
Yeah, I know; that's the problem.
but you will still just run off and do whatever you want?
what kind of a man are you that just...
they killed Sara and put her head in a box!
and they've got my son!
Oh, Linc, I'm... I'm sorry.
you still here?
Lechero wants to talk to you.
I was just about to get a little trim.
Lechero said I was looking all bhuttu!
it'll wait.
did you know about this?
did you know anything about this?!
me? No! No! Nieves...
Nieves-- we was friends, man.
that's right!
if you knew he was using and didn't tell me...
his death is on your head.
I don't know nothing about drugs.
I don't. I don't.
I mean, hell, I...
I tried me some reefer when I was 12,
I almost coughed up a lung.
good.
that's good.
teodoro.
there appears to be an opening on my crew.
mcgrady, here's your cross back.
and, uh... thank you.
you're a real smart guy.
what the hell are you doing in prison?
here.
it's perfect.
how did you get it?
it's what you wanted, right?
Yeah.
good work.
so what's the next step?
uh... we wait.
and... I'll keep you posted.
you know what you need to do.
what do you think?
when I fix electricity for reason, but it can't have been to make that fence sizzle like the third bloody rail.
unless you want to make the colonel happy.
actually, it's in both of our best to make that fence as deadly as possible.
now all we have to do is wait for my brother to come through with the grave digger.
this is good for a start.
but I want more.
he wants more.
you said $15, 000.
you said $15, 000!
fifteen to listen.
you said $15, 000! You said $15, 000!
we got it, Linc! I got it!
I want big cash understand?
calm down if it's money you want.
no, no, no!
what the hell are you doing?!
we need him! He will sell us out to the cops after he takes as much as he can from us.
he's packing up to go.
kill him.
he's going to betray you. Kill him.
good news, Agent Mahone!
due to the untimely demise of Ser Juan Nieves,
I have now been promoted manager in charge of retail distribution and customer liaison.
get away from me.
all in due time.
now, I'm not your momma, and I ain't one to wipe other's noses, but let's just say you've looked better.
I want nothing from you.
but sure seems you need something.
on the arm.
no strings attached.
get your head straight, Alex.
come on in, man.
come watch the match. Come.
Oh, yeah. You guys call this football down here, right?
very good, very good.
it's World Cup-- football without the silly hats you wear in America, where they all jump on t each other like a bunch of batty boys.
have a seat.
come.
teodoro.
caf?
the only thing I hate more than a rat is a rat with bad information.
Yeah, look, I'm sorry about all that, but my information was good.
it's just that Scofield is a tricky bastard.
he'll try something again. You'll see.
wait! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
come on, you guys. What are you doing to me?
come on! I gave you good information!
Scofield's planning to escape! I'm telling you!
he's a smart bastard!
come on, you guys. Come on. What are you doing?
no. No.
No! No.
look, I gave you good information.
U said something this morning about, "If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'."
just be thankful I don't hold you to that.
come on, Bagwell.
help me here, man! Come on.
Bagwell!
you left this in your old cell.
Thanks, Alex.
you're welcome.
it's funny that you could forget something as important as this is.
well, I'm glad you found it for me.
Yeah.
Oh. Oh, look.
you are breathing only by my grace, Michael.
now, you remember the next time that you're going to send me on a goose chase.
okay? I didn't.
no, no. You did.
and you think you can manipulate me, just like you did to Sucre... and Tweener and Haywire.
I'm not your errand boy.
I'm going to go with you when you escape, and if you think, in any way...that you'll leave me,
I will put this piece of metal right in that very small space right between your eyes. I will.
how's LJ? How's Sara?
they told me they're fine.
listen, uh, the grave digger is gone.
what do you mean, he's gone?
Linc, we can't do this without him.
we know, we know, that's why we went to his supervisor
the guy who approves any hires for that job.
turns out he could use some cash.
Oye, man. Mail call.
this is we're getting out?
Yes.
with a little help from an old friend.
what is that?
it's a chemical that kills the odors caused by decomposing bodies.
and when heated to a certain degree...
...it eats through steel.
your name is roman nevikov?
my name is roman nevikov.
aren't you supposed to be in prison?
no man is supposed to be in prison.
okay.
but the federal authorities believe that you're in prison.
Yes, they believe that.
so how can you be here?
a man I know has kindly offered to serve my time for me.
that was very nice of him.
people like to do favors for me.
always have. I don't know why.
maybe it's because you'll kill their families if they don't.
Yes, maybe.
can we talk about charlie crews?
isn't that why you are here?
if you could say one thing to charlie crews, what would it be?
one thing? Anything?
Yes, anything.
okay. Okay.
this is what I would like to say to charlie crews.
my friend.
beautiful.
would you like to say hi?
Oh, we'd better change this tape.
if anyone's seen where we are, yes?
okay. Go ahead. Say it.
play it again from the beginning.
okay. Go ahead. Say it.
crews, he says he wants rayborn.
he says you bring rayborn to him...
you bring rayborn to him and I can go. Crews
but rayborn is dead.
I know that.
so why does roman nevikov think mickey rayborn is alive?
maybe he knows something we don't.
well, you got about five minutes to figure out what that is.
the brass saw that tape. Now they're coming down here to see you.
and I could care less what they do with you,
but you will tell me why nevikov thinks rayborn is still alive
and you will tell me what I need to know to get reese back.
you want her back?
well, i should go before the brass gets here.
okay, where's your first stop?
our friends at the f. b.i.
no, last time we asked them questions they stonewalled us.
last time I asked them questions like a cop.
this time it'll be a little different.
I should, uh, maybe leave this. - No, no. Keep it. It'll help.
but leave your phone. They'll track you on it.
here. Take mine. They won't look for it.
detective crews. You go get her.
got nothing else to do today.
Where's detective crews?
you see where crewsent?
find him.
what we learned as children, that one plus one equals two, we know to be false.
one plus one equals one.
we even have a word for when you plus another equals one.
that word is
I need to see rayborn's body.
and you think that crews is gonna give you what you want?
he'll find you, but he won't give you what you want.
he'll give you something else.
and what is that?
I think you know what that is.
you're connected to me.
I'm connected to crews.
he'll find you. - Connected.
that was our friend.
he says crews is probably headed back this way.
and he wants you to pick up his shirts.
you do that for him? - Yeah.
hello.
detective crews. It's seever. Do not go to the f. b.i. There was a shooting.
the people you're going to see are no longer there.
there's three dead.
you have the names of the f. b.i. Dead?
Yeah.
any of them bodner? - No.
they catch the shooter? - No.
not my phone. Not my numbers.
Tidwell's phone. Tidwell's numbers.
but I can...
I can get the number that just dialed me. I can do that, right?
this is jane seever. Leave a message.
Seever, go to my phone. I need bodner's number. Call me with it.
Roman send you?
Yeah.
I'm done.
I'm done, aren't i?
Charlie, i got that number. I'm gonna text it to you, okay?
okay.
got it. Hey, bobby. Get rid of my phone.
Charlie, get rid of your car.
but I just got it back.
that'll kill you. The coffee. It'll kill you.
you could have killed me. - But I didn't.
but you could have.
I saw his head by the window.
how did you know I wasn't standing right next to him?
because if he were here to kill you, he'd have made you stand over there.
what if he wasn't here to kill me?
then i'd have to kill you.
agent bodner, if he wasn't here to kill you, you're still working for roman.
and i'd have to kill you.
what's going on out there?
Roman has reese.
so what does roman want with you? - Rayborn.
but rayborn's dead.
Roman wants him anyway.
we should go.
we can't take that. - I just got it back.
my wife and kids are still gone. Maybe we can take her...
her what?
her minivan.
smooth ride.
four-star rating.
two dvd players. 16 cup holders.
what if roman was right?
what if rayborn is still alive?
I saw the pictures of that boat. How do you live through that?
people live through a lot of things you never thought they could.
yeah? Okay.
everyone's looking for roman nevikov.
maybe we should look for rayborn.
well, l.a. p.d.f. b.i.and that fancy security expert can't find his body.
his body. His sick body.
rayborn was sick, was having treatments almost every day.
if he is still alive, then
he still needs those treatments.
let's go see his doctor.
Mr. Rayborn was being treated for a very rare form of cancer.
Charlie would like the name of his doctor. Do you have that?
Yes, i do.
he never went anywhere without one of our men.
except the night he went missing.
he would take his boat out on his own.
I tried to dissuade him of that practice but he'd assured me that there were no pirates in los angeles.
this is the name of his doctor.
Thanks, ted. Stay there.
we might need ms. Puryer's services again.
sippy cup.
how long you been married?
20 years. Still love her.
Where'd you meet? - In the bureau.
we were partners.
there is something else you could do for me.
you wish me to find your olivia now?
my? She's not "my" olivia.
clearly.
we've got a dead f. b.i. Agent in there.
not the one who lives here.
we've got detective crews' car but no detective crews.
and we've tracked detective crews' cell phone to the trash can in your break room.
you find crews. He's on my cell.
you up for this?
Oh, yeah. I'm up for this.
that information is privileged.
look, doc, your patient might still be alive.
if he is, he's getting treatment somewhere.
you're not still treating mickey rayborn, are you?
no. I'm not still treating him.
doc, I'm gonna have to lock the door now.
you understand me?
you are l. a.p. d?
Yeah, but not at the moment.
and you're f. b.i. - but not at the moment.
then who are you at the moment?
I'm just a guy with one question-- what did mickey rayborn suffer from?
it's a very rare form of cancer.
and the treatment?
it's very technical.
but it made him weak.
it made him pale.
what did we find on that boat, agent bodner?
we found a lot of blood.
weak? Pale?
those are symptoms of blood loss, right, doc?
okay. I'm gonna lock the door.
he wasn't sick. He wasn't.
and the treatments? - I was stockpiling his blood.
it's a common practice.
patients do it before surgery all the time.
but he wasn't having surgery.
no. He wasn't.
it was for that boat.
to make us think he was dead. Enough so that we wouldn't question it.
he's been planning this for a while.
Yeah, he has. But why?
this is your plan?
my plan is on the way.
they put you away for killing that guy you owned that bar with?
you did 12 years hard time?
and you got $50 million?
now you're eating burgers in the back of a minivan on the run from half the cops in l. a.
you've made some interesting career choices.
I am where I am.
how far back you go with rayborn?
I don't go back with rayborn at all.
but that guy you owned that bar with.
you and him were laundering money for rayborn, right?
no, not me and him. Just him.
just him?
he was your friend and you didn't know?
I guess I didn't know him.
is this a private club or can anyone join?
that depends on if you got me what I asked for.
it's not zen, charlie.
it'll just have to do until zen comes along.
Charlie, i know she's your partner, but maybe you should let someone else
everyone else go after her.
Roman wants me. - Yeah.
why is that?
what is it, roman?
things not going according to plan?
he's getting closer, isn't he?
he's out there, but he's getting closer.
and you're hiding in this basement.
connection by connection...
until he's right in front of you.
that is where I want him.
sounds like you're in love, roman.
go ahead.
go ahead, cry. I will understand.
it runs in your family.
your father...
he cried before I killed him.
crews, he says he wants rayborn.
he says you bring rayborn to him...
you bring rayborn to him and I can go. Crews
there's something in the back.
we've e. q.ed out everything.
in the back we have dogs, russian techno, men's and women's voices
no, it's something else.
some other, uh, music. Keep working it.
captain tidwell.
may I see your phone, please?
my-- - your phone. Your cell phone.
it's in my office. I'll have to go get it.
I can't seem to find it.
I'm always losing it somewhere.
maybe someone picked it up by accident.
is it possible detective crews picked it up by accident?
anything's possible.
pull the vehicle over to the curb.
keep your hands where I can see them.
sure hope you kids got just cause for pulling us over because this man here is a federal agent and me?
I'm just in a real bad mood.
sir, i need to see your phones.
Oh, what do you know.
must have walked off with my captain's phone by accident.
they catch you with me, you're back in uniform-- if you're lucky.
they catch me with you, i'll say I'm bringing you in, i get promoted, and luck has nothing to do with it.
fair enough.
fair enough.
disposable phone.
who are you calling?
rayborn likes his pleasures.
if he disappears, he's going first-class.
his money is all still here.
come on, ted. A guy like rayborn must have undisclosed wealth.
well, undisclosed to the government, yes. But not to us.
we provide total protection, all aspects.
well, not all aspects.
we hadn't counted on having to protect mr. Rayborn from himself.
it's all there, charlie.
how much?
he's big. Bigger than you.
even bigger than I ever was, and we all know how big that was.
well, what about the cars, boat, jet?
it's all where he left it. He-- he just left everything sitting there.
took nothing but a plan. Thanks.
you never asked exactly what he was dying of?
well, i assumed he was reticent to speak of it.
I mean, powerful men are often loath to consider their own fragile mortality.
I'm a grandfather.
his name's ted, my grandson.
it's all over after that, right?
you're all done after you're a grandfather.
spain.
your olivia. In spain now.
I know. She's not "your" olivia.
rayborn leaves with nothing but a plan.
how do you live with no money?
how do you live with no money?
that's what I just said.
it's a good question.
how does he live with no money?
homeless shelters were part of mr. Rayborn's philanthropy.
how many shelters does he operate?
the rayborn foundation operates five homeless shelters in the greater los angeles area.
does he visit them? - Yes. Frequently.
does anyone from your office go with him?
of course.
does he visit all of them?
let me check his account.
no, he did not.
he only visited four of them.
so there's one where rayborn has never shown his face?
but I did know him.
Tom seybolt was my friend.
detective crews?
could I ask you to do something?
I need you to get a murder case file.
the seybolt killings.
okay, yeah. Sure.
you want to do this first?
found me, huh, kiddo?
I always knew you were a good cop.
crews, he says he wants rayborn.
not music but I know that sound.
says you bring rayborn to him...
you hear that? Listen.
I'm sorry, i don't hear anything.
it's a subway.
listen.
crews, he says he wants rayborn.
don't give me that look.
I know what a subway sounds like.
even if it is, there must be a truckload of places in l. a.
you could hear the subway from that level.
then we send a truckload of cops.
easy, kiddo.
I'm a dying man.
except you're not dying.
we're all dying.
some sooner than others.
detective crews.
this will not bring detective reese back.
Where's your partner, kiddo?
don't call me "kiddo.
get her back from whom?
you know the answer to that.
from roman nevikov.
what's he want for her?
you know the answer to that, too.
he wants me, does he?
I fooled everyone but the russian.
he would need to see my body.
even with all that blood, he'd need to see it.
so what are you going to do?
I'm gonna give you to roman.
it goes through six shell companies and two cousins but that building belongs to roman nevikov.
I know what a subway sounds like.
we got a body here.
captain, we have not secured that area yet!
follow him!
what does roman want with him?
Roman wants his money.
let's go get your partner back.
how do we let roman know that we have him?
that part is easy.
you are not under arresting me?
I was hoping we could work something out.
that will not be problem.
I just need you to talk.
okay.
you want me to be bad girl?
I need you to talk to your friends, and then they'll tell their friends,
and then roman will hear what charlie crews wants to tell him.
and-- and what is that?
head on out the 10.
I already read it.
the case file from your arrest.
when I found out I was assigned to you, i read it.
eh, you like to be prepared.
what do you want to know, detective crews?
I think you'd need to see it.
no, i don't.
I have a-- - photographic memory?
eidetic is the technical term, but yes, I have the ability to recall text with extreme accuracy and in abundant volume.
the man I owned that bar with-- the man who was murdered
what did they find in his desk?
the cops pulled evidence from his desk.
tax forms, uh, drawings that his kids made, a photo of you two fishing, an application.
for a cab license?
a cab license.
does that mean anything?
it means he needed a second job.
it means he need money.
I-if your friend was laundering money, why would he need a second job?
I knew my friend.
what if he wasn't laundering money?
if he wasn't dirty, then he wasn't killed because he was skimming.
so why'd they kill him?
if my friend was clean, if tom was clean, then maybe they went to lean on him to try to get him dirty.
he was a run-of-the-mill bar owner.
why get him dirty?
because he owned that bar with a cop.
if you get him dirty, you get a cop dirty.
you own him, you own a cop.
but that cop is you.
Seever, pull the car over.
the journey, kiddo, always leads back inside.
ain't that grand?
no, no, no.
you have to save reese.
you always knew I was a good cop?
what do you mean by "always"?
how long have you known me?
you are a good cop because you listen.
always" means before the killings, the arrest, the trial.
I saw you at the academy.
you had that look.
there.
that look.
what were you doing at the academy?
I knew someday i'd be old.
we'd need a younger man to run this thing.
I looked at every cadet, and I chose you.
I was gonna get that tom seybolt a little dirty so you would have to help him out.
now, that family was not supposed to die.
you were not supposed to go to jail.
but they did.
and you did.
but just look at you.
I chose you, kiddo.
and I was right.
I was right.
don't call me "kiddo.
it's always been about you, charlie.
even that animal roman knows that.
where is he?
where is rayborn?
I didn't bring him.
did you bring reese?
okay. Okay.
I do not trust you.
you do not trust me.
how do we do this?
easy.
I just need you to tell me one thing.
I need you to tell me why you want rayborn.
because I do.
no.
that's just how bad you want him, not why.
is it just the money? 'Cause I don't think it's just the money.
if you want reese, you bring him to me.
then tell me why you want him.
okay. Then you can't have him.
but you can have this.
that's the bullet you wanted bodner to kill me with.
it's my gift to you.
this-- this is why he
this is why he what, roman?
nothing.
nothing.
there can't be nothing.
I am not attached to that gun.
thank you ever so much.
where are you going?
the police have mr. Rayborn and detective seever.
I am going to fetch mr. Rayborn now.
what about charlie?
seems to have gone missing.
how did they find them?
rayborn and seever.
how did the police find them?
well, i told them where to look.
why would you do that?
Cliome mr. Earley.
you and detective crews are terribly sweet and serious gentlemen, but mickey rayborn's my client.
now, i must do my job, mustn't i?
rayborn told the brass you saved his life.
got you a promotion.
you know why he did that, right?
Yes, i do.
because now I owe him.
crews was gonna trade rayborn for reese.
that's right.
so what's he gonna do now?
you want me to talk again?
Yeah.
and what shall I say this time?
I'll write it down for you.
Charlie wants to know if roman likes oranges.
you own this orange grove?
bought it when I first got out.
don't get out here as much as i'd like to.
not sure I understand you.
not sure I do, either.
having a little trouble with my math today.
math?
now I'm sure I do not understand you.
detective new money.
you are there?
I am here.
I am bringing her to you.
is rayborn there?
Yes.
let me hear you say it.
rayborn is here.
okay.
I see any other cop cars, helicopters, i shoot reese in the head and leave her on road.
what do you mean, your math?
Oh, you know.
adding things up.
well, i guess I understand that.
how's the family, agent bodner?
getting along.
still on holiday?
you must miss them so.
okay.
I don't see rayborn.
sure you do.
he's right here.
but he's not. Shoot her.
this is why he what, roman?
you know what I'm talking about.
wait, wait.
what you said to me-- it's why he what?
why rayborn what, roman?
why he didn't choose you?
is that what?
where is rayborn?
well, as I said, you're looking right at him.
whatever you want from rayborn, you can get it from me now.
his accounts, his connections-- everything he knew, i know.
but it's just the money, right?
that's all you want.
you for her.
me for her.
bring her out.
just breathe.
no, no. No touching.
no tricks.
search him.
what was his plan getting in that s. u.v?
his plan was getting you out of that s. u.v.
he calls you an animal.
he calls you an animal.
but it's not so bad, because I've seen him with his dog, and he loves
he loves that animal, so you know.
it's not so bad.
I'll need his account numbers.
foreign and domestic.
keys to safety deposit boxes.
combinations to home and office safes.
you will give me these things.
sure.
but that's not what you want.
what you want is what rayborn gave me.
you want him to choose you.
you want what he gives his dog.
you want his
what are those numbers?
do you want to know how I got through 12 years of prison?
your zen?
like that.
whatever he had on you and your families is gone.
so we can start over right now, or we can go on killing.
you fellas do speak english?
what we learned as children,
we know to be false.
went to spain
one plus one equals one.
we even have a word for when you plus another equals one.
that word...
is love.
Smeagol!
I've got one!
I've got a fish, Smeag. Smeagol!
pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on. Pull it in.
Deagol!
Deagol?
Deagol.
give us that, Deagol, my love.
Why?
because...
...It's my birthday and I wants it.
my precious.
they cursed us.
murderer.
murderer" they called us."
they cursed us and drove us away.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gollum.
and we wept, precious.
we wept to be so alone.
and cool So nice for feed.
and we only wish to catch a fish.
so juicy sweet.
and we forgot the taste of bread...
the sound of trees...
the softness of the wind.
we even forgot our own name.
my precious.
wake up!
wake up!
wake up, sleepies.
we must go, yes.
we must go at once.
haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?
I've gone and had too much.
must be getting late.
no.
it isn't.
it isn't midday yet.
the days are growing darker.
come on!
must go! No time!
not before Mr. Frodo's had something to eat.
no time to lose, silly.
here.
what about you?
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Leastways, not for lembas bread.
Sam.
all right.
we don't have that much left.
we have to be careful or we're going to run out.
you go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.
I've rationed it.
there should be enough.
for what?
the journey home.
come, Hobbitses.
very close now.
very close to Mordor.
no safe places here.
hurry.
I feel like I'm back at The Green Dragon...after a hard day's work.
only, you've never done a hard day's work.
welcome, my lords...
to Isengard!
you young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on...
and now we find you feasting and... and smoking!
we are sitting on a field of victory...
...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
the salted pork is particularly good.
salted pork?
Hobbits. - We're under orders from Treebeard...
who's taken over management of Isengard.
young Master Gandalf.
I'm glad you've come.
I can master wood and water, stock and stone .
but there is a wizard to manage here...
Iocked in his tower.
and there Saruman must remain under your guard, Treebeard.
well, let's just have his head and be done with it.
no.
he has no power anymore.
the filth of Saruman...
is washing away.
trees will come back to live here.
young trees.
wild trees. - Pippin!
bless my bark!
Peregrin Took!
I'll take that, my lad.
quickly, now.
tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country.
hail the victorious dead.
Hail!
I am happy for you.
he is an honorable man.
you are both honorable men.
it was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory.
don't listen to me.
you are young.
and tonight is for you.
Oh, you can search far and wide. You can drink the whole town dry
but you'll never find a beer so brown.
as the one we drink in our hometown.
you can drink your fancy ales. You can drink 'em by the flagon
but the only brew for the brave and true,
comes from The Green Dragon!
thank you! I win!
no news of Frodo?
no word. Nothing.
we have time.
every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.
do we know that?
what does your heart tell you?
that Frodo is alive.
Yes.
Yes, he's alive.
too risky. Too risky.
thieves.
they stole it from us.
kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.
quiet! Mustn't wake them.
mustn't ruin it now.
but they knows.
they knows.
they suspects us.
what's it saying, my precious, my love?
is Smeagol losing his nerve?
no. Not.
never. Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.
Smeagol wants to see them dead.
and we will.
Smeagol did it once. He can do it again.
it's ours!
ours!
we must get the precious. We must get it back.
patience! Patience, my love.
first we must lead them to her.
we lead them to the Winding Stair.
Yes, the stairs. And then?
up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go...
until we come to the tunnel.
and when they go in...
there's no coming out.
she's always hungry.
she always needs to feed.
she must eat.
all she gets is filthy Orcses.
and they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious?
no.
not very nice at all, my love.
she hungers for sweeter meats.
Hobbit meat.
and when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes...
then we will find it.
and take it for me!
for us.
Yes. We meant "for us."
Gollum. Gollum.
the precious will be ours...
once the Hobbitses are dead!
you treacherous little toad!
No! No! Master!
no, Sam! Leave him alone!
I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us.
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly.
he's a horrid, fat Hobbit...
who hates Smeagol...
and who makes up nasty lies.
you miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!
Sam!
call me a liar? You're a liar!
you scare him off, we're lost! - I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.
I won't wait around for him to kill us! - I'm not sending him away.
you don't see it, do you?
he's a villain.
we can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide.
I need you on my side.
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.
I know, Sam. I know.
trust me.
come, Smeagol.
the stars are veiled.
something stirs in the east.
a sleepless malice.
the Eye of the enemy is moving.
what are you doing?
Pippin!
Pippin?
Pippin.
what, are you mad? - I just want to look at it.
just one more time.
put it back.
Pippin.
No!
Pippin.
he is here.
I see you.
Pippin!
help! Gandalf, help!
someone help him!
Pippin!
fool of a Took!
look at me.
Gandalf, forgive me.
look at me.
what did you see?
a tree.
there was a white tree...
in a courtyard of stone.
it was dead.
the city was burning.
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?
I saw...
I saw him.
I could hear his voice in my head.
and what did you tell him?
speak!
he asked me my name. I didn't answer.
he hurt me.
what did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?
there was no lie in Pippin's eyes.
a fool...
but an honest fool he remains.
he told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.
we've been strangely fortunate.
Pippin saw in the palantir a glimpse of the enemy's plan.
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.
his defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.
he knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.
men are not as weak as he supposed.
there is still enough courage, strength to challenge him.
Sauron fears this.
he will not risk the peoples of Middle-earth uniting under one banner.
he will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...
before he sees a king return to the throne of Men.
if the beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan must be ready for war.
tell me...
why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours?
what do we owe Gondor?
I will go. - No!
they must be warned. - They will be.
you must come to Minas Tirith by another road.
follow the river and look to the black ships.
understand this:
things are now in motion that cannot be undone.
I ride for Minas Tirith...
and I won't be going alone.
of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst.
Hurry! Hurry!
where are we going?
why did you look?
why do you always have to look?
I don't know. I can't help it. - You never can.
I'm sorry, all right?
I won't do it again. - Don't you understand?
the enemy thinks you have the Ring.
he's going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here.
and you...? You're coming with me?
merry?
come on.
how far is Minas Tirith?
three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.
and you better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.
here.
something for the road.
the last of the Longbottom Leaf.
I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pippin.
but... But we'll see each other soon.
won't we? - I don't know.
I don't know what's going to happen.
merry. - Run, Shadowfax.
show us the meaning of haste.
merry!
merry!
take her by the safest road.
a ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.
it waits to carry her across the sea.
the last journey of Arwen Undomiel.
there is nothing for you here...
only death.
lady Arwen...
we cannot delay.
my lady!
tell me what you have seen. - Arwen.
you have the gift of foresight.
what did you see?
I looked into your future, and I saw death.
but there is also life.
you saw there was a child. You saw my son.
that future is almost gone.
but it is not lost.
nothing is certain.
some things are certain.
if I leave him now...
I will regret it forever.
it is time.
from the ashes a fire shall be woken.
a light from the shadow shall spring.
renewed shall be blade that was broken.
the crownless again shall be king.
reforge the sword.
your hands are cold.
the life of the Eldar is leaving you.
this was my choice.
whether by your will or not...
there is no ship now that can bear me hence.
we've just passed into the realm of Gondor.
Minas Tirith.
city of kings.
make way!
it's the tree.
Gandalf. Gandalf.
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.
the tree of the king.
lord Denethor, however, is not king.
he is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.
now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.
to give him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise.
and do not mention Frodo or the Ring.
and say nothing of Aragorn either.
I n fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.
hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion, lord and steward of Gondor.
I come with tidings in this dark hour, and with counsel.
perhaps you come to explain this.
perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.
Boromir died to save us...
my kinsman and me.
he fell defending us from many foes. - Pippin.
I offer you my service, such as it is...
in payment of this debt.
get up.
my lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir...
but it is not now.
war is coming.
the enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged with the defense of this city. Where are Gondor's armies?
you still have friends. You are not alone in this fight.
send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.
you think you are wise, Mithrandir.
yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom.
do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind?
I have seen more than you know.
with your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor.
and with your right you'd seek to supplant me.
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
and I tell you now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North...
last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship.
authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king, steward.
the rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.
come.
so I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.
I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting.
do they? - You're in the service of the steward now.
you're going to have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took, guard of the Citadel.
it's so quiet.
it's the deep breath before the plunge.
I don't want to be in a battle...
but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse.
is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?
there never was much hope.
just a fool's hope.
our enemy is ready.
his full strength's gathered.
not only Orcs, but Men as well.
legions of Haradrim from the south...
mercenaries from the coast.
all will answer Mordor's call.
come on.
this will be the end of Gondor as we know it.
here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.
if the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...
...the last defense of this city will be gone.
but we have the White Wizard. That's got to count for something.
Gandalf?
Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant...
the one who will lead Mordor's armies in war.
the one they say no living man can kill.
the Witch-king of Angmar.
you've met him before.
he stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.
he is the lord of the Nazgul...
the greatest of the Nine.
Minas Morgul is his lair.
the Dead City.
very nasty place. Full of enemies.
quick. Quick.
they will see. They will see.
come away. Come away. Look, we have found it.
the way into Mordor.
the secret stair.
climb.
no, Mr. Frodo! - Not that way!
what's it doing? - No.
they're calling me. - No.
hide! Hide!
I can feel his blade.
we come to it at last.
the great battle of our time.
come away, Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.
the board is set.
the pieces are moving.
Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done.
another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.
you must not fail me.
quiet.
to the river. Quick. Quick. - Go. Go.
come on.
faster.
draw swords.
hold! Hold!
what?
amon Din.
the beacon. The beacon of Amon Di n is lit.
hope is kindled.
the beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!
Gondor calls for aid.
and Rohan will answer.
muster the Rohirrim.
assemble the army at Dunharrow.
as many men as can be found. You have two days.
on the third, we ride for Gondor and war.
forward. - Very good, sir.
Gamling. - My lord.
make haste across the Riddermark.
summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.
I will.
will you ride with us? - Just to the encampment.
it's tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men.
the men have found their captain.
they will follow you into battle, even to death.
you have given us hope.
so it is before the walls of Minas Tirith...
the doom of our time will be decided.
now is the hour. Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.
now, fulfill them all. To lord and land!
Faramir!
we can't hold them. The city is lost.
tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith.
Nazgul.
take cover!
Nazgul!
fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!
fall back!
retreat! Retreat! - Come on!
the age of Men is over.
the time of the Orc has come.
take cover!
take cover, my lord!
it's coming!
it's Mithrandir. - The White Rider!
pull!
Mithrandir.
they broke through our defenses.
they've taken the bridge and the west bank.
battalions of Orcs are crossing the river. - It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.
long has he foreseen this doom. - Foreseen and done nothing.
Faramir?
this is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path.
no.
you've seen Frodo and Sam?
where? When? - I n lthilien.
not two days ago.
Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale.
and then the pass of Cirith Ungol.
what does that mean?
what's wrong? - Faramir, tell me everything.
careful, master. Careful.
very far to fall.
very dangerous are the stairs.
come, master.
come to Smeagol.
Mr. Frodo.
get back, you!
don't touch him!
why does he hates poor Smeagol?
what has Smeagol ever done to him?
master?
master carries heavy burden.
Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.
fat one cannot know.
Smeagol look after master.
he wants it.
he needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.
very soon he will ask you for it. You will see.
the fat one will take it from you.
send forth all legions.
do not stop the attack until the city is taken.
slay them all.
what of the wizard? - I will break him.
what of Theoden's riders?
will Rohan's army come?
Mithrandir.
courage is the best defense that you have now.
here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor...
in peace or war...
in living or dying...
from...from this hour henceforth...
until my lord release me...
or death take me.
and I shall not forget it...
nor fail to reward that which is given.
fealty with love.
valor with honor.
disloyalty with vengeance.
I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses...
defenses that your brother long held intact.
what would you have me do? - I will not yield the river in Pelennor unfought.
Osgiliath must be retaken.
my lord, Osgiliath is overrun.
much must be risked in war.
is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord's will?
you wish now that our places had been exchanged...
that I had died and Boromir had lived.
Yes.
I wish that.
since you were robbed of Boromir...
I will do what I can in his stead.
if I should return, think better of me, Father.
that will depend on the manner of your return.
what are you up to?
sneaking off, are we?
sneaking?
sneaking?
fat Hobbit is always so polite.
Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find...
and they say "sneak."
sneak?
very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious.
very nice, very nice. - All right. All right!
you just startled me is all.
what were you doing?
sneaking.
fine. Have it your own way.
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.
we have to be moving on.
it's dark still.
it's always dark here.
it's gone!
the Elven bread. - What?
that's all we have left.
he took it. He must have!
Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.
Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread.
you're a lying wretch! What did you do with it?!
he doesn't eat it.
he can't have taken it. - Look.
what's this?
crumbs on his jackets. He took it!
he took it.
I seen him. He's always stuffing his face when master's not looking.
that's a filthy lie!
you stinking, two-faced sneak!
Sam! - Call me...
stop it!
Sam!
I'll kill him! - Sam! No!
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to go so far. I was just so... So angry.
here, just... Let's just rest a bit.
I'm all right. - No.
no, you're not all right. You're exhausted.
it's that Gollum.
it's this place.
it's that thing around your neck.
I could help a bit.
I could carry it for a while.
carry it for a while.
I could carry it... I could carry it.
share the load... Share the load... the load... the load.
get away!
I don't want to keep it.
I just want to help.
see? See?
he wants it for himself.
shut up, you!
go away! Get out of here!
no, Sam.
it's you.
I'm sorry, Sam.
but he's a liar.
he's poisoned you against me.
you can't help me anymore.
you don't mean that.
go home.
Faramir!
Faramir!
your father's will has turned to madness.
do not throw away your life so rashly.
where does my allegiance lie if not here?
your father loves you, Faramir.
he will remember it before the end.
can you sing, Master Hobbit?
well...
Yes.
at least, well enough for my own people.
but we have no songs for great halls...
and evil times.
and why should your songs be unfit for my halls?
come, sing me a song.
home is behind
the world ahead
and there are many paths to tread
through shadow
to the edge of night
until the stars are all alight
mist and shadow
cloud and shade
all shall fade
all shall
fade
March! March!
March! March! March!
make way for the king.
make way.
the king is here.
my lord.
hail to you, sire.
Grimbold, how many?
I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.
we have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.
where are the riders from Snowbourn? - None have come, my lord.
six thousand spears.
less than half of what I'd hoped for.
six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.
more will come.
every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.
we have till dawn, then we must ride.
the horses are restless...
and the men are quiet.
they grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.
that road there...
you ever seen anything like that?
I don't even know what I'm looking at.
that's just wrong.
lucky for you, for this type of crisis.
it's a mercy killing on a burrito this bad.
whoa, whoa, whoa, girl. You sure about that?
control, this is CSI Brody.
we've got a single-car collision, Tropicana, block east of Nash, injuries.
paramedics are on their way.
he's got a pulse, but he's lost a lot of blood.
he's got a really nasty head wound here.
we've gotta move. Engine's going up.
all right, I'm gonna try to get him out of here.
come on, boy, I got you. - I'll get his legs.
come on. Come on.
okay...
get him far enough back now. - I'm trying.
Ah, that's good, that's good.
Wes Clyborn. Seven Hills address.
Wes, Wes, my name's Nick.
you hang in there now. Help's on the way.
damn. - What?
he didn't hit his head. This is a gunshot wound.
I didn't hear a shot before the crash.
I definitely didn't hear two. I think that's a second GSW to the abdomen.
looks like the same caliber.
They're-they're-they're bleeding.
what are you trying to say, Wes?
they're dying.
who's dying, Wes? Wes, talk to me.
who's dying?
grab those doors for us?
hang in there, Wes.
you're in good hands now, bud. They're gonna take care of you.
we've got a GSW to head and abdomen.
okay. Get him on the monitor. Full set of stat labs.
type and cross for packed red cells for transfusion.
we have O-neg standing by.
16 or 18 gauge.
excuse me, Nurse, I'm with the Crime Lab.
I'm gonna need to take the clothes he's wearing with me, okay?
I'll see what I can do.
prep him for a central line.
code blue. He's in V-Tach.
okay. Clear the room.
that includes you, Crime Lab.
Yes, sir.
thank you.
morgan called. Told me you'd followed the victim here.
wow, look at you. You all right?
uh, yeah. I'm fine.
but, man, this guy's in really bad shape.
and here's the thing.
he said that there are others, and that they're dying or dead.
I'm not really sure what to make of it.
so you think there's another crime scene out there?
maybe more victims, too, you know what I mean?
okay.
why don't you clean yourself up. I took the liberty of bringing you a shirt from your locker.
Thanks.
you hang here, if our guy pulls through, maybe he'll tell you something.
more than just "thank you."
Hey, Nick...
way to go.
that took a lot of guts.
Thanks.
registration belongs to Elena Perez, 35.
Vartann's checking out her address.
no known employer.
looks like she's been living here.
blood on the headrest is from transfer from Wes Clyborn's head wound.
no high-velocity blood spatter. No gunshot.
no HV on my side, either.
significant blood pool on the driver's seat.
probab from the shot to the abdomen.
that's a lot of blood.
so... not shot in the car.
Shotefore he got in the car.
losing blood, losing consciousness, he runs into the billboard tru
you know, considering his condition, he couldn't have gotten more than a mile or two.
couple of square miles... and still a lot of ground to cover.
our primary could be anywhere.
crime Lab.
well, I'm Nick. Stokes.
what's your name? - I'm Lauren.
Lauren, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too.
Yeah, thanks for your help. - Sure.
I have the patient's clothing for you.
okay. Good.
sorry. Got a little scissory.
Oh, that's okay.
so... how's he doing?
he's good. Out of surgery. Stable.
the doctor removed this from Mr. Clyborn's abdomen.
fortunately, internal damage was minimal.
only one bullet?
the one that penetrated his brain's gonna require more attention.
a neurosurgeon's flying in from L. A.
you've done this before.
Yeah, more times than any one person should have to.
the owner of the Grand Am, Elena Perez, was evicted from her place a month ago.
and no one has reported her missing.
so I'm working on a warrant for her cell phone records.
that might be the only way to track her down.
what about the cell phone that Nick recovered from the victim?
Yeah, Wes Clyborn. He's a popular guy.
I traced most of the calls to his friends.
and no one has ever heard of Elena Perez, and nobody knew where he was last night.
one thing, though-- the last few calls, they were all made to the same number.
do we know who?
there's no way to know. It was a "pay-as-you-go" cell.
Oh, great. So totally untraceable.
bullet entered the left middle temporal lobe. Houses the hippocampus and related structures.
those are areas related to his memory, right?
right.
generally, retrograde amnesia exhibits a temporal gradient.
last in, first out.
so things he learned in school, his mother's name, sense memories, there's a good chance they remain.
but the memory of who shot him last night...
may or may not be there.
okay. So is he conscious?
fully.
soon as the neurosurgeon arrives, we prep him for surgery, take him in.
what are his chances?
I don't think we'll know till we get in there.
so if you're going to talk to him, do it now.
appreciate it.
look at that. He's conscious.
how you doing, man? You look good.
thank you.
Yeah.
no.
thank you.
the nurse said you saved me.
Yeah.
you don't remember any of that, huh?
no. I'm sorry.
wait, you don't have to apologize to me, man.
you got a massive head wound. It's gonna take some time.
so it's bad if the beeps stop, right?
it's not good, no.
but don't worry about that. That's not gonna happen.
do me a favor, Wes.
let me see your hands.
if you were in a struggle with somebody, we might be able to find something that can help us out here.
Yeah, sure. Whatever you need.
Ooh, looks like you put up a hell of a fight.
why would anyone want to hurt our son?
did someone try and rob him?
we don't know that, sir. That's what we're trying to find out.
you guys have any idea where he was last night?
no.
well, do you know who he might've been with?
Wes has a lot of friends.
okay. But he still lives at home th you, right?
Yeah, since he graduated in May. From 'SC.
he's still exploring his options.
we give Wes his space. He comes and he goes.
not much more we could tell you.
except that he's a good boy.
do you recognize this woman?
no. Why?
name's Elena Perez. She's the owner of the car that Wes was driving.
I've never seen her before.
you're sure she's not a friend of his?
I've seen enough of Wes's friends to know this woman would definitely not fit in with any of them.
now, if you'll excuse us... we'd like to see our son.
dad's not exactly Mr. Warmth, is he?
I think I found our other victims...
the ones the guy in the hospital was talking about.
what do you mean found them? Where?
here. They're all over his shirt.
no surprise I found the victim's blood. But I found three other contributors.
three other people.
I know.
is Elena Perez one of them?
based on exemplars from her car, yes.
what about the other two?
one is male. Familial match to Elena.
I ran it through CODIS and got a hit on her brother, Juan Perez.
convictions for assault, armed robbery... and, oh, yeah, carjacking.
paroled six months ago.
what about the last contributor?
unknown female.
look at all that carnage.
wonder what the hell happened right before Wes Clyborn got in that car?
I don't know.
I can't get you any closer to the primary.
I don't have any answers about what might have happened or how. Or why.
all I have is blood.
sometimes blood is all you need.
Oh, boy. Wish me luck.
where are you going?
we need a blood whisperer.
no signs of forced entry.
victim probably knew her assailant.
could have been a hotel employee who had a key... who had access.
M. E. estimates time of death around midnight.
C. O.D. is blunt force trauma, consistent with the claw hammer.
Yeah.
you're killing me. Tell me something I don't know.
guys, your bosses are paying me a lot of money for this seminar.
come on!
okay, I'll give you a hint.
look at my body.
the position of my body.
right, sorry, got it, um...
your hand appears to be extending outward.
good, good. Why is that significant?
look at the blood smear.
I've made a blood angel here. Why?
well, at first blush, it looks like you're trying to reach your cell phone that fell under the lamp there, but the blood angel shows that your arm stopped, so you didn't get the phone.
you didn't call 911.
you got any ideas?
the assailant's still in the room.
she's afraid to call.
Jules, what do you say?
I say he's close, and there's only one person in the world who would dare to call me Jules.
okay, guys, that's a 482. We'll pick up after lunch.
I know what you're thinking.
of all the mock crime scenes in all the world...
no, that is not what I'm thinking.
it's good to see you. I like your scene.
are you on the registration list? - Uh, no.
because I know you don't like to make social calls unless, of course, you want to make your wife happy, and I don't see her around.
so what do you want, Mr. Russell?
straight to the point, as usual.
okay, uh... I need a little help.
open case-- blood's all we got, but, oh, it's a good one.
we know how it ended last time.
Yes, yes, that's true, uh, but this is just one case.
I'm already working a crime scene.
you sure? - Yeah.
okay. Well, worth a shot.
Oh, yeah, uh, before I go, I almost forgot.
the assailant was still in the room, uh, but your arm was reaching out but not to grab your cell phone but to motion to your daughter to tell her to stay hidden.
I know you... you think you hate me, but the whole, uh, lying on the floor, playing the victim thing kind of says you miss me.
or not.
okay.
Lauren. Got your message.
what's going on?
it's Wes Clyborn.
is he all right?
he's a little worked up.
what do you mean? Why?
I don't know, he won't talk to me. Keeps asking for you.
all right, cool, I'll talk to him.
Thanks.
Hey, it's good to see your appetite.
but you didn't eat the Jell-O.
I remember something.
okay. Remember something from last night?
I was in a room.
a room. What kind of room? Do you recognize it?
no, I'd never been there before, but th-there was a man.
and he had a gun.
you recognize him, know his name?
no.
was it that dude?
I tried to fight this guy off.
don't worry about it. He had a gun.
next thing I remember, I was running.
I had car keys, but they weren't mine.
I-I took her car.
her? Do you mean Elena? Elena Perez?
I don't know.
it's all right. Is that her?
Yeah, yeah, sh-she was there, but... th-th-there was somebody else, another girl.
who?
I can see her, she... She was beautiful.
you, uh, you hadhis pendant in your pocket.
you were carrying it around. It must be important.
think it was hers?
Vicky? Her name is Vicky? - Yeah.
all right, all right, that's good. That's going to help us out.
listen, Wes... you and I are going to figure this out together.
we're gonna find Vicky and we're gonna find out who did this to you. I promise.
Hey, ran ballistics on the bullet that was pulled out of Wes Clyborn's stomach.
it matches a round fired at a liquor store robbery four weeks ago.
perp's still out there along with the gun.
liquor store robbery would match Juan Perez's M. O.
and grabbing up two rich kids at gunpoint fits with what Nick has gotten from Wes Clyborn up to this point.
so does Henry's DNA report.
the bullet had Wes Clyborn's DNA.
well, that makes sense.
it also had tissue that belongs to our unknown female.
well, that means...
the bullet traveled through our unknown female...
before landing in Wes Clyborn.
Clyborn says he remembers a girl named Vicky.
she was with him when he was shot. Girlfriend maybe.
through-and-through. The tissue on the bullet says it wasn't a head shot.
she could still be alive.
she hasn't called for help.
well, maybe she can't. Maybe she's still being held.
bleeding out on a floor somewhere.
Wes might have been the lucky one.
think you're getting kind of forgetful.
must be all of that Zen master living-in-the-moment stuff.
Yeah.
at least you remembered to put on socks.
did you take a look at it?
Yes, I did.
it is a good one.
Yeah. So?
I want to have some ground rules. - Okay.
all right, number one, you are not to call me Jules in front of other people.
it is Finn. - Finn.
number two, we are never going to talk about the past.
sounds to me like you want to live in the moment.
and when that Zen crap starts, we need to have a safe word.
pick one.
"stop." Would that work?
you got it.
all right. And what about you-- do you have any rules?
I'm gonna have to hire you on a temporary basis, uh, as a consultant.
I've already run that by HR. - Of course you have.
and... legally, we need to pay you a consulting fee.
figured the case was so fascinating, you'd want to do it for nothing.
you know me so well.
and you know blood better than anybody I know.
all right, I want your best DNA person.
I don't want your best tech. I want your best mind.
you got it.
you got me.
Wow. The case file did not do this justice.
Sanders, right?
uh, Greg.
you know, I get the whole E. R. urgency over evidence thing, but did you cut out all these samples?
no. But if I were still working DNA, I would have.
no, no, no, it's not you. DNA is king these days, but people don't understand that blood spatter can often tell you more than any test tube.
Russell says you're the man.
Oh, did he?
I try my best.
God, I hope somebody got some pictures before the DNA moths got to this.
great.
we're not totally screwed.
Yeah, we're pretty good about using cameras around here.
okay, we're going to reconstruct all the blood events on these clothes and we're gonna map every inch by DNA contributor.
I have the DNA reports right here.
Oh, good.
Oh, do you have a dummy?
wow, you truly are the Blood Whisperer.
stop.
okay, so we've got five blood events.
my logic suggests a certain order.
okay, let it bleed.
all right, so your victim remembers a struggle with Juan Perez.
here is Juan's blood on Wes's shirt.
pattern indicates blunt force trauma, close quarters combat.
but I don't think that Juan was the only one in there fighting.
so... brother and sister were both mixing it up with Wes.
both getting their blood on him, and then, according to Wes, Juan goes ballistic-- literally-- firing a bullet...
through our unknown female and into Wes.
okay, so that could be girlfriend Vicky.
could be.
here's her HV spatter from the through-and-through.
of course, nothing says "fight over" like a good shot to the head.
and so do the gravitational drops from Wes's head shot, leaving the final blood-soaked area from the abdominal gunshot wound.
nice job.
thank you.
so... our kid wrestles with two assailants, gets shot twice.
but how the hell did he get out of there?
maybe he was left for dead.
well, that does not bode well for Vicky.
I talked to Juan Perez's PO. He hasn't heard from Juan in a week.
no current address and no job on file.
on the bright side, I think I found Vicky.
Really? How'd you do that so fast?
I just did a web search, man.
I punched in Vickys with a connection to Wes Clyborn.
of course.
I think I got a lot more than I bargained for.
a newsletter from Jonah Clyborn's financial firm?
take a look at the Christmas candids.
former assistant to John Clyborn, filed for unemployment two months ago.
it looks like she's hoing onto the boss pretty tight before he let her go.
Yeah, maybe because she found another Clyborn to hang onto.
what do you mean?
I went by Vicky Sheldon's place; she wasn't there.
landlord said that he hasn't seen her the past 24 hours, but he has seen plenty of Wes Clyborn the last few months.
well, maybe this Juan Perez dude graduated from carjacking to hit man.
and maybe my next search turns up a connection between him and the dad.
you really think the old man would put out a hit on his own son?
Hey, over a woman?
anything's possible, I guess.
look, you said it yourself, right? This guy isn't exactly Mr. Warmth.
no. No, he's not.
Mr. Clyborn?
thank you for coming down.
I know you've already spoken to my colleagues at the hospital, but I just have a few more questions for you.
what about?
she worked for you as your personal assistant for over a year.
that is, right up until... two weeks ago, when she was fired.
Vicky was one of several personal assistants.
Yeah, but probably the only one who's dating your son. Am I right?
news to me.
so, that wasn't the reason why she got her pink slip?
and... how long have you known about the relationship?
Wes told me about it a month ago.
do you approve?
Wes is an adult. He makes his own decisions.
that wasn't a yes.
honestly, I think she was using my son.
how's that?
while Vicky was employed by my husband,
I learned that Wes was supplementing her wages with checks drawn from Jonah's business account.
I told Jonah to fire her.
Mrs. Clyborn, are you sure that Wes was the one that was paying her bills?
what exactly are you suggesting?
okay, let's see. Three days ago, a car crashed into the wall outside of Vicky Sheldon's home.
just barely missed going through her picture window. - So?
so... by the time the police arrived, both the car and the driver were gone.
and Vicky didn't want to talk about it, and nobody saw anything but the car.
not many fender-busted Bentleys get sold for scrap around here.
Oh, yeah, and, um, car's registered in your name.
I wasn't driving it.
Wes told me he hit a fire hydrant.
well, that's got to be a little infuriating.
more engine than he could handle.
no, I mean, kid lives at home, spends your money, wrecks your car.
late at night, outside the home of your ex... assistant.
that's got to grind at you.
I know you aren't accusing me of something.
if Wes wanted to go slumming with the help, that was his prerogative.
kid didn't deserve to get killed over it.
but that's on him. Not me.
new lab coats.
although, I ordered periwinkle, not royal blue.
they're not for you.
this work smock is from the trunk of Elena Perez's car.
and this one, I just found searching Vicky Sheldon's apartment.
Vicky and Elena worked together?
identical smocks.
and they definitely know each other.
I found Elena's number written on a note in Vicky's place.
working with a lady who's living in her car.
that's a doozy of a drop from Vicky's previous job.
so maybe Vicky wanted to cushion the fall with some Clyborn money.
got Juan and Elena to help her rob Wes, the rip-off went bad, and Wes escaped?
"Laverne and Shirley" gone femme fatale. Love it.
and I would love to know where those smocks were employed.
can you please check them for trace? Any answer could help us find our primary.
finally got cell phone records for Wes, Juan and Elena last night.
last calls were made at the same time in the same vicinity.
got the cell phone towers.
let's see where the coverage overlaps.
overlap places all three callers...
here.
arroyo Horizons Business Park.
why would they all be there on a Saturday night?
LVPD.
site manager said this was the only facility that wasn't locked down.
got blood. Shoe impression.
Yep.
looks like it's coming from back there.
body's cold. She's been here for a while.
same story here.
it's hard to tell from what's left of her face.
what the hell happened in here?
well, it's not like Wes Clyborn can really help us out right now.
no, but I know who can.
Yeah, the only guy we know who walked out of here.
he's got a lot to answer for.
fabulous Las Vegas.
not so fabulous for her.
Elena Perez's car said she was down on her luck.
looks like her luck ran out.
still in full rigor.
T. O.D. is approximately 18 to 24 hours ago.
same time frame as this poor girl.
Vicky Sheldon, GSW through and through.
there's quite a blood pool here.
bullet probably severed her left hepatic artery.
well, if that's the case, she lost consciousness and then bled out rather quickly.
got off easy compared to her friend.
massive blunt force trauma.
nearly every bone in her face is smashed.
overkill. Rage.
the wounds show a distinctive pattern.
could be brass knuckles maybe.
maybe.
but how do you explain the punctures?
I might be able to answer that question.
brass knuckles included.
could have a partial palm print here.
looks like what happened in Las Vegas kind of stayed on Las Vegas.
well, I see your palm print, and I raise you a knee impression and a footprint.
what kind of shoes was Wes Clyborn wearing?
uh, dress shoes. Why?
these aren't dress shoes. They're work boots.
and they look like they are hauling ass out of here.
right out the back door.
work boots weren't the only thing hauling ass.
tire treads.
got some paint. Could be transfer.
it looks like we've got some trace here.
white and crusty.
not much different than what's in your fridge.
sodium bicarbonate.
trace from the boot print is baking soda?
specifically, the chemical formulation used in industrial cleaning supplies.
still pretty generic. Doesn't get us any closer to tracking Juan.
well, if you want unique, I've got just your color.
royal crimson metallic.
auto paint transfer from the loading bay at the crime scene.
used exclusively on one vehicle model, Austin Healy B-100.
from 1955 to 1957.
that's a hell of a nice car.
I don't see Juan Perez owning it.
maybe he was working on it.
soda blasting.
sodium bicarbonate applied through compressed air.
used by auto-detailing places to prep a car that's about to be repainted.
perhaps with royal crimson metallic.
maybe Juan borrowed the car.
if you owned a classic ride like a '56 Austin Healy, I doubt you'd take it to the corner body shop.
no. I'd go to the best to pimp my ride.
that guy there.
LVPD.
your parole officer's been looking for you.
so have we.
I guess you found me.
that had to hurt.
maybe you can fix that dent before we take you downtown.
what took you so long?
I've been busy today.
we recovered Juan Perez's gun. We're running it.
well, I can tell you right now that Juan fired that gun.
all right.
blood pools from Wes Clyborn's two gunshot wounds.
he was shot standing, falls.
Blee from the head and the gut.
and over here, HV spatter, another blood pool.
which comes from Vicky Sheldon's GSW, the through-and-through, which ends up in Wes.
okay, so, bang, bang.
two gunshot victims.
efficient, expedient.
nothing in common... with this.
the beating of Elena Perez.
Yeah. Look at all of that blood.
not efficient. Not expedient.
no. I calculated roughly ten to 12 blows to the head with the murder weapon.
and then this knee impression.
at first, I thought that it was the killer.
but the void from the castoff and spatter is actually on the other side of her.
so, the killer was on this side, which means that the knee impression was not from the killer.
it was from somebody who came after the beating.
maybe somebody who wanted to help.
somebody like a brother.
where are you going with this?
Juan may have pulled the trigger, but I don't think he was the trigger.
it's a little Zen.
okay, so, our current assumption is that Juan Perez held Wes Clyborn here at gunpoint, right?
right.
so, let me ask you a question.
you're an ex-con with a gun at my back.
okay.
and you are ready to use it.
Where's my safe word?
you don't need one. You have a gun... and I don't.
and all of this blood says that I managed to punch you in the face, not once, but over half a dozen times.
a rich kid takesown an ex-con with a gun?
how does that happen?
it doesn't.
you make a good case.
Juan Per's blood makes the case.
he may have walked out with that gun, but I don't think he brought it.
doesn't look good, Juan.
career criminal running from the cops, gun with your prints found in your work locker.
so why all the talk?
I mean, you got me, and you got the gun.
and ballistics confirms that you used it against Wes Clyborn and Vicky Sheldon.
if you don't mind, I have one question.
am I going to give it up, right?
why el you think I'm sitting here without some half-asleep, court-appointed, public pretender sitting next to me?
that wasn't my question.
we have your sister Elena's cell phone records that shows that she called you the night of the murders.
my question is, why?
why do you think?
I think she needed you because she was scared for herself and her friend Vicky, whose ex had been calling her all night long.
he tried to ram his car through her apartment a couple of days before that, but now he had a bigger head of steam going.
he wanted what was his...
and he came for it.
it's over!
you got that part right.
what's going on?
how am I doing so far?
you were just trying to protect your sister.
you just didn't count on the rich boy having brought a street gun to the party.
you came to, you saw Wes beating your sister, and you had to stop him.
you had to protect the family.
get off her!
Juan, put the gun down, please!
you had no other choice.
your sister was already dead.
you knew how things would look, so you ran.
this is your lucky day.
there's the pen, and there's the paper.
write it down.
Yeah, I was always the troublemaker.
life wasn't fair, so I made it fair.
but Elena never complained.
Elena worked hard.
Elena had faith.
and the one time that she needed me-- someone like me...
I failed her.
how the hell do you know what went on in that room?
I have a very smart friend.
she's your friend, too.
give us a minute, will you?
tried to take my hallway walk.
cops wouldn't let me leave.
I'm not going home... am I?
no.
did I hurt Vicky?
you hurt 'em all, Wes.
two people are dead because of you.
I remembered something this morning.
I loved her.
I know I did.
the person you say did this...
I don't even know him.
neither do I, man.
that was very nicely done.
you did all the work.
I did, didn't I?
and here's your... dollar back.
like you said, I'm not really in it for the money.
don't you ever miss it?
I mean, you've been out of the game now, how long?
you know how long.
you want back in?
you asking?
Oh, come on. Don't make me beg.
I like it when you beg.
I have my own envelope.
my expenses.
party table rental, two smocks, some paints. It's all in there.
come on. What do you think?
I don't know. I really don't know.
okay.
I will think about it.
I may call you.
I may answer.
nobody calls me Diebenkorn around here. It's D. B.
... who was asked by the city of Philadelphia...
... if she cold offer psychological conseling to Cambodian refgees...
... boat people, who had recently arrived in the city.
deborah was danted by the task. These Cambodians...
... had sffered genocide, starvation, relatives mrdered before their eyes...
... years in refgee camps, harrowing boat trips to the West.
how could she relate to their suffering?
how could she help these people?
so guess what all these people wanted to talk about...
... with my friend Deborah, the psychologist.
it was all, "I met this guy in the refgee camp.
I thought he really loved me, but when we got separated...
... he took up with my cousin. Now he says he loves me...
... and keeps calling me. They're married now. What shold I do?
this is how we are.
may I help you?
I'm Liz Gilbert. I'm writing a magazine article on Bali.
I wanted to meet a medicine man.
everyone said I should meet Ketut Liyer. Am I in the right place?
wait.
I mean, here I am with a ninth-generation medicine man...
... and what do I wanna ask him about?
getting closer to God?
saving the world's starving children?
happy to see you. I am Ketut Liyer.
Nope. I wanna discuss my relationship.
you are a world traveler.
you will live a long time...
...have many friends, many experiences.
you will have two marriages. One long, one short.
am I in the long one or the short one?
can't tell.
also you will lose all your money.
I think in next six to 10 months.
don't worry. You will get it all back again.
and you will come back to Bali...
...and live here for three or four months and teach me English.
I never had anybody to practice my English with.
and then...
...I will teach you everything I know.
wait.
I have this for you.
keep grounded so it's like you have four legs.
that way, you can stay in this world.
also, no looking at world through your head.
look through your heart instead.
that way, you will know God.
which is why you came here, no?
see you later, alligator.
I proofread all of her manuscripts.
my wife is very, very beautiful, but she can't spell for anything.
look at Uncle Stephen.
and Auntie Liz.
I'm counting the minutes for this to be over so I can get in my big-girl pants.
you look fantastic. You just had a baby.
Oh, you're lying. I'm fat, I'm exhausted...
...I can't keep two thoughts. I feel like Liza Minnelli.
Stephen, can you hold Jack?
I'm gonna introduce you to Walter. - Yeah.
Hey, dude, you wanna grab a beer or something?
my new book comes out in April. Thank you for asking.
great. - May.
may. May.
this is Andre. You two are Times' Most Notable nominees.
so glad to finally meet you. - Nice to finally meet you.
I fed him nachos. Is that bad?
you look comfortable. What'd you feed him, chloroform?
give him to his dad. - I told you, nachos.
know what? I'd be asleep too if I had a dump like that.
we'll give him to his mom. - Come here then.
wanna help me change his diaper? - Yes, I do.
Hey, how's the vintage car thing going?
Oh, no, no, no. I changed jobs. I'm a pastry chef now.
you mean you're a baker. - Yeah.
you wanna get baked?
I know, I know.
it's hard, isn't it?
Oh, no. This is so much fun.
did you know the exact moment you wanted to have a baby?
I can't remember, but I've had the box since before I got married.
what box?
it's girly and embarrassing, and you'll laugh at me if I tell you.
I will laugh at you, but you still have to tell me.
come on.
under the bed.
I've been filling it with baby things...
...waiting until Andy was ready to be a father.
so sweet.
does this come in my size?
I have a box just like this, except it's filled with National Geographics...
...and The Times travel section.
all the places I wanna see before I die.
Liz, having a baby is like getting a tattoo on your face.
you kind of wanna be fully committed.
so my trip to Aruba next week, which is just a basic, you know...
..."where to sleep, swim and stuff your face" piece...
I got a new bikini.
and it turns out, I have unlimited minibar access.
you know what that means? - Jet lag?
you, me...
...macadamia nuts.
that was cute.
you know who I was talking to at the party who was really inspiring...
...was Tara's friend. - Brian.
Brian. Unbelievable. He's a teacher, you know that?
he's a substitute teacher, isn't he?
Yeah. He was talking about the budget cuts that are happening now.
there's no money for anything.
there's no music classes, there's no arts classes.
they're volunteering their time to do all of this after school.
they're educating our kids, you know?
I think you'd make a great teacher, honey.
thank you, but I was thinking more of like...
...education. Getting my master's, going back to school. I don't know.
you know?
... You know...
going back to school. - I'm just thinking out loud.
I was getting the sinking feeling that Kett's prophecy was coming tre.
was I in the shorter marriage?
we'd only boght this hose a year ago.
hadn't I wanted this?
I had actively participated in every moment of the creation...
... of this life.
so why didn't I see myself in any of it?
the only thing more impossible than staying...
... was leaving.
I didn't wanna hrt anybody. I wanted to slip qietly ot the back door...
... and not stop rnning ntil I reached Greenland.
instead, I made a decision.
to pray.
yo know, like, to God.
and it was sch a foreign concept to me, that I swear I almost began with:
I'm a big fan of yor work.
Hello, God?
nice to finally meet you. I...
I am sorry I've never spoken directly to you before...
...but...
...I hope I've expressed my...
...ample gratitude for all the blessings you've given...
...to me in my life.
I'm in serious trouble.
I don't know what to do.
I need an answer.
please, tell me what to do.
Oh, God, help me, please.
tell me what to do and I'll do it.
go back to bed, Liz.
I don't wanna go to Aruba.
I don't wanna be married.
you know, there's a whole divorce section downstairs.
pepper grinder. - She's having...
...a nervous breakdown. - This is what girls do.
she's processing. - Why doesn't she get drunk or laid?
that's what I would do if you left me.
no, you wouldn't.
no, I wouldn't. - She moved out, she filed for divorce.
they were together eight years. She's got no home.
legacy.
every word in Italian is like a truffle. A magic trick.
honey, I get it. It's your life raft right now.
when Andy and I broke up for two weeks, I bought a loom.
a frigging loom. And he tried to start a microbrewery.
I don't know how you guys aren't sick of me now. I'm sick of me.
are you kidding me? We love having you.
it's kind of like having a writer in residence.
but you are a writer. You should be writing something.
maybe I could write about a woman who goes to Italy to learn Italian.
call it Carbohydrates and Conjgations.
I'll start looking for a place.
I'm falling in love with you. - I'm not who you think I am.
I'm just your fantasy.
no, that's bullshit. You're real.
your scars, your talent.
the fact that I own a piece-of-crap bar...
...and you accept that that's all I'm gonna do.
okay, this sucks.
I second that. - Don't be rude.
I love your pain.
and I love that when we're together, I can make it go away.
Oh, he's good. - Your love...
he's hot, there's a difference. ...is like a hot panini.
and when I look into your eyes, I hear dolphins clapping.
I did not write that line.
here's what he doesn't know yet.
I disappear into the person I love.
I am the permeable membrane. If I love you, you can have it all.
my money, my time, my body...
...my dog, my dog's money.
I will assume your debts and project upon you...
...all sorts of nifty qualities you've never actually cultivated in yourself.
I will give you all this and more...
...until I am so exhausted and depleted...
...the only way I can recover...
...is by becoming infatuated with someone else.
Elizabeth, hi. - Hi.
Oh, really?
how you doing?
Cheers.
thank you. - I owe you an apology.
for the walkouts. - Well, I'm not everyone's cup of tea.
I doubt that.
I, on the other hand, was shit.
although I was trying very hard. - "Shit" is a strong word.
thank you.
you seem shorter in person than on the stage.
Really? I hear that a lot. - Sorry.
it's good.
it's unnerving when...
...a total stranger sees you more clearly than you see yourself.
that's what I mean by saying you're short.
are you hearing dolphins clapping right now?
I took a few liberties with your material.
I give you full permission to make fun of me. I know you're dying to.
you're far too charming to make fun of.
I'm still hearing them.
is that your guru?
you're joking, but, yes, it is.
she's beautiful.
Yeah. A friend told me about her.
I was out of work and feeling pretty desperate for something.
not the last time I was out of work, the time before that.
and I just had this feeling like I was looking in all the wrong places.
looking for what?
God.
she has an ashram in India. I'm dying to go, but...
...you know, you have to get, like, three stages of hepatitis shots...
...and my insurance always runs out.
I'll go when the time's right.
there's a gathering of her students every morning.
if you want, I could take you sometime.
if you're not unnerved by 100 crunchy people chanting in Sanskrit.
I need to be unnerved.
David. A yogi from Yonkers.
I didn't exactly fall in love with the gy.
what happened was I dove ot of my marriage...
... and into David's arms...
... exactly the same way a cartoon circs performer...
... dives off a high platform and into a small cup of water...
... vanishing completely.
your underwear, my queen.
he just folded my delicates.
Oh, my God, baby, you are in so much trouble.
Thirty-six?
my client is simply not interested in a divorce.
is he serious?
is he really representing himself?
one semester of law school right here, baby.
great. Well, what would it take to interest your client?
okay, so here's the deal. You have screwed up my life...
...but what I wanna know is why couldn't you find yourself...
...in our marriage? Why didn't you say what you were thinking?
I did. You never listened to me. - No. You never said:
Hey, you know what? You suck. I'm deeply unhappy.
you just took off. You never gave me a chance to address those problems.
that's not fair. That's just quitting. I took vows.
till death. And I take them seriously.
I believe this is just a phase and I'm willing to wait it out.
you are always waiting, Stephen.
waiting for me to come home, to wanna have kids...
...to make you dinner. I don't know why we can't accept...
...we don't wanna live in unhappiness anymore.
I accept the fact that I am occasionally unreliable...
...and I often get sidetracked, but I thought you liked that about me.
I thought it was okay that I had hopes and dreams.
have a dream. Stephen, great, fine. Do that. Just pick one.
okay, I pick one. I pick you.
I know this is awful.
but I believe with every molecule of my body that you will find the person...
...that wants just what you want.
that will give you what you want and what you deserve. I'm not her.
well, you obviously know nothing about what I want.
my client would like to submit a song he wrote...
...that he believes is relevant to these proceedings. Goes something like this:
are you kidding?
quitter, quitter, quitter!
how about I take the blame? I am the one who couldn't deal...
...with another weekend roaming some box-shaped superstore...
...buying appliances on credit...
...and pretending to be a couple that neither one of us ever knew how to be.
you wanted that toaster.
you like faking it, fine. You're stellar. I'm the failure. I suck at faking it.
it was not my finest hour. - So where do things stand now?
we're prepared to offer half of everything...
...including my client's retirement accounts.
take it all then. Everything.
he still said no.
he hates me now. - He doesn't hate you.
his heart is broken.
I think he hates you.
I'm never letting you out of the basement.
why don't we talk next week and we'll see where things stand?
okay. - These things have a way...
...of working themselves out.
so why'd you become a vegetarian?
I saw some cows slaughtered one time.
barely touched your dinner.
he's 28.
this is hard for him, isn't it? And you?
the meditations help.
Liz.
you remember a couple of years ago, when you threw yourself into...
...the renovation of your kitchen? You were consumed...
...with being the perfect wife and cook.
I was trying to make it work.
well, I think chanting and meditation is the same thing...
...in a different costume.
definitely give me that documentary.
I've been thinking about vegetarianism.
my triglycerides are through the roof.
Yeah. Thanks for everything.
great to meet you.
what? - Nothing. It's just...
...you know, you used to look like Stephen.
now you kind of look like David.
you know?
what I meant was, you know how people start resembling their dogs?
why would he say that, we look like the same dog?
he was joking. - Not funny.
well, he had five Heinekens. He was bombed.
well, not funny.
we don't look like the same dog.
if anything, you're a collie and I'm a Tibetan mastiff.
don't you wanna give me a chance to miss you?
yo wanna go away for a year?
do yo know what I felt when I woke up, Delia?
nothing. No passion, no spark, no faith, no heat. Absolutely nothing.
I've gotten past the point where I can be calling this a bad moment.
and it just terrifies me. Jesus, this is like worse than death to me...
...the idea that this is the person I'm gonna be from now on.
this happens to people.
they fall in love in their 20s, get married...
...do the granite countertop, white-picket fence in their 30s...
...and somewhere they realize, "This is not for me.
so they fail and they fall down, they hurt like hell, they straighten up...
...and march their asses to the shrink's office.
they can't just check out. - I am not checking out.
I need to change.
you have a support system here, Liz.
you have friends and family who love you.
and do you feel my love for you? My support for you? No.
there's, like, nothing. I have no pulse.
I am going to Italy. - Italy. Why Italy?
what did you have for lunch? - I don't know. A salad.
exactly. I used to have this appetite for food, for my life...
...and it is just gone.
I wanna go someplace where I can marvel at something.
language, gelato, spaghetti, something.
you're talking like a college kid. - I've been acting like one.
since I was 15, I've either been with a guy or breaking up with a guy.
I have not given myself two weeks of a breather...
...to just deal with, you know, myself.
what's going on with you and David?
what, did you fall out?
I don't know how to be here.
you wanna know how to be here? Stop constantly waiting for something.
I'm going to Italy and then I'm going to David's guru's ashram in India...
...and I'm going to end the year in Bali.
that's what I'm gonna do.
that's harder to argue with. The beaches are nice. But why?
Ketut told me I would. - Guy with no teeth.
when you're desperate...
...and some guy who, yes, looks a little like Yoda...
...hands you a prophecy, you have to respond.
do you need a Xanax? - Always.
okay, I'm just gonna say it. I'm gonna say it and be done with it.
what if it doesn't work?
my whole life fits in a 12-foot-square box.
you know how many times I hear that in a day?
most of them never come back for their whole life.
Hello? - Liz.
good news. Stephen just signed the divorce papers.
I'll probably be back in a week, penniless with dysentery.
you're my hero.
Hey.
if you stay, we'll go out for Indian every night.
you never asked me to stay.
go, go, go.
there is a wonderfl old Italian joke...
... abot a poor man who goes to chrch every day...
... and prays before the state of a great saint, begging:
dear saint, please, please, please let me win the lottery.
finally, the exasperated state comes to life...
... and looks down at the begging man and says:
my son, please, please, please by a ticket.
so now I get the joke.
and I've got three tickets.
you heat the water on the stove.
so if I want to bathe?
you put the water in the tub.
okay.
Yeah. It doesn't really seem like enough water to bathe in.
not enough.
Yes, it's enough.
fill it up three, four, five times.
everything that's important gets cleaned.
is this safe? This...
...scaffolding?
it holds up the ceiling.
otherwise it will fall apart.
everything falls apart, my dear.
the only thing permanent in life is family.
you're not married.
no, divorziata.
why divorced?
we broke it.
you're more happy now?
I have one rule.
no strange men spending the night.
you American girls when you come to Italy...
...all you want is pasta...
...and sausage.
I'll take it.
good. You chose well.
cappuccino.
it's a zoo in here. - And my Italian sucks.
how long have you been here? - Two weeks. You?
six weeks. You'll get better.
two cappuccinos, please.
and warm the milk this time.
yesterday it was too hot and burned my tongue.
you like Napoleons? - Of course.
and two Napoleons, please.
your Italian is fantastic.
I have a wonderful tutor. I'll give you his number if you like.
he's really good and he needs work. - Oh, great.
are you Dutch? German?
Swedish. Even colder people, if you can imagine.
I'm Liz, by the way. - Sofi.
you can say:
it's past.
too fast, but okay.
you can say:
what a beautiful word.
come on, it's "let's cross over." It's so ordinary.
no, it's the perfect combination of Italian sounds.
it's the wistful "ah," the rolling trill, the soothing "ess."
that's true. - I love it.
all right, let me teach you a word.
therapist.
therapist.
come on. - Good. You gotta learn humor.
it's not. - Come on. Cheers.
shall we continue Tuesday at 5? - Yes.
with another bottle of the therapy? - Of course.
you're doing very well, Liz. - Thank you.
and you must be very polite with yourself...
...when you learn something new.
Yes. Grazie, I agree.
but your English... How are you even talking to me like this right now?
I think you're gonna teach me more than I teach you.
you have good Italian. Very good.
all right.
I am alone.
I feel so guilty. I've been in Rome for three weeks...
...all I've done is learn a few Italian words and eat.
you feel guilty because you're American.
you don't know how to enjoy yourself.
I beg your pardon? - It's true.
americans know entertainment, but don't know pleasure.
this is Luca Spaghetti, by the way, you know.
your name is Luca Spaghetti?
Yes, that's what our family is called.
we invented it. I'm serious. Listen to me.
you want to know your problem? Americans.
you work too hard. You get burned out.
then you come home and spend the whole weekend...
...in your pajamas in front of the TV.
that's not far off, actually.
but you don't know pleasure. You have to be told you've earned it.
you see a commercial that says, "It's Miller time..."
...and you say, "That's right. Now I will go to buy a six-pack.
and drink the whole thing and wake up the next morning and you feel terrible.
but an Italian doesn't need to be told.
he walks by a sign that says, "you deserve a break today..."
...and he says, "Yeah, I know."
that's why I'm planning on taking a break at noon...
...to go over to your house and sleep with your wife.
we call it "dolce far niente.
it means...
...the sweetness of doing nothing. We are masters of it.
he's right. He says...
...you can't learn Italian like this.
you don't speak the language just with your mouth, speak it with your hands.
like this?
okay. Is yelling.
"that MEAL WAS EX CELLENT!"
"suck IT!"
all this gives me a stomachache.
"screw YOU!"
I think that's my neighbor Lorenzo. - Charming.
another way to say "SCREW YOU..."
so anyway, to start off I'd say...
excuse me.
come here.
for the table...
...a big platter of artichoke alla giudia...
...prosciutto with melon...
...and eggplant with ricotta affumicata.
then spaghetti alla carbonara...
...pappardelle with ragu of rabbit...
...and linguini with clams.
then tripe alla romana...
...and saltimbocca.
and two more liters of the vino sfuso from Genzano.
thank you.
you did it. Yes.
Liz Gilbert, you are a Roman woman now.
no, only honorary.
that is a real Roman woman.
Yeah, with a lot of international friends.
that one, I'd bite.
maybe you and Rome just have different words.
different words? - Yeah.
Yeah. It's like each city has a word, if you really think about it.
like, what is the word for London?
I would say "stuffy." - I would agree with that.
what's the word for Stockholm? - Are you kidding? "Conform."
and New York?
"ambition" or "soot."
what's the word for Rome?
it's kind of difficult to think about.
it's classic.
sex.
of course.
so, what's your word, Liz? I'm curious. I can't figure it out.
well...
it might be...
it started as "daughter." I was good at that. And then...
..."wife." Not so good.
girlfriend.
not so good.
my word's "writer."
Yeah, but that's what you do. That isn't who you are, no?
maybe you're a woman in search of her word.
Hey, Sofi, it's Liz. Let's go to Naples. Maybe my word is "pizza."
listen, lady, I am only 7, but I can tell you're a complete moron...
...because I am from Naples.
I love this place, but Giovanni said to watch out.
his cousin got mugged here in a museum.
are you serious? - Watch out for the scooter. Yeah.
I'm in love. I'm having a relationship with my pizza.
you look like you're breaking up with the pizza. What's the matter?
I can't.
what do you mean, you can't? This is pizza in Napoli.
it is your moral imperative to eat that pizza.
I want to, but I've gained, like, 10 pounds.
I mean, I've got this...
right here. What's it called? What's the word?
a muffin top.
I have one too.
I unbuttoned my jeans five minutes ago just looking at this.
let me ask you a question.
in all the years you've ever undressed in front of a gentleman...
hasn't been that many. - All right, well...
...has he ever asked you to leave?
has he ever walked out? Left? - No.
because he doesn't care.
he's in a room with a naked girl. He's won the lottery.
I'm so tired of saying no and then waking up in the morning...
...and recalling every single thing I ate the day before.
counting every calorie so I know exactly...
...how much self-Ioathing to take into the shower.
I'm going for it.
I have no interest in being obese. I'm just through with the guilt.
this is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna finish this pizza...
...and then we're gonna go watch the soccer game.
and tomorrow we're gonna go on a little date...
...and buy ourselves some bigger jeans.
giovanni likes a muffin.
Attagirl.
he's saying, "For whom are you playing?"
per chi, for whom.
pull, pull. I'm sucking it in.
put some Swedish muscle into this.
you think this happened to Sophia Loren?
there it goes. Almost got it.
go, go, go. You're not trying.
I've almost got it. I've almost got it. I did it.
Oh, that's beautiful. You should get it.
for whom?
for you, Liz. Just for you.
no, I'm happy just with my big lady pants.
thanks for the day. And the leg room.
it was fun.
we're gonna go for food. Wanna come?
no. No, I'm good.
the sweetness of doing nothing.
please. Please get off the floor.
will you please just? Will you come up here?
what if we just acknowledge that we have a screwed-up relationship...
...and we stick it out anyway?
we accept that we fight a lot...
...and we hardly have sex anymore...
...but that we don't wanna live without each other.
and that way we can spend our lives together...
...miserable...
...but happy not to be apart.
dear David:
we haven't had any commnication in a while...
... and it's given me time I needed to think.
remember when yo said we shold live with each other and be nhappy...
... so we cold be happy?
consider it a testimony to how mch I love yo...
... that I spent so long poring myself into that offer...
... trying to make it work.
bt a friend took me to the most amazing place the other day.
it's called the Agstem.
Octavian Agsts bilt it to hose his remains.
when the barbarians came, they trashed it along with everything else.
the great Agsts, Rome's first tre great emperor...
... how cold he have imagined that Rome...
... the whole world, as far as he was concerned, wold be in rins?
during the Dark Ages, someone came in here and stole the emperor's ashes.
in the 12th century, it became a fortress...
...then a bullring.
they stored fireworks in here after that.
nowadays, it's a bathroom for the homeless...
...so you better watch your step going down.
it's one of the qietest and loneliest places in Rome.
the city has grown p arond it over centries.
it feels like a precios wond...
... like a heartbreak yo won't let go of becase it hrts too good.
I like it messy.
we all want things to stay the same, David.
I guess the guy before me must've been some angel, huh?
settle for living in misery...
... becase we're afraid of change, of things crmbling to rins.
then I looked arond in this place, at the chaos it's endred...
... the way it's been adapted, brned, pillaged...
... then fond a way to bild itself back p again, and I was reassred.
maybe my life hasn't been so chaotic. It's jst the world that is...
... and the only real trap is getting attached to any of it.
rin is a gift.
rin is the road to transformation.
Hey.
you ready?
Yeah.
even in this eternal city, the Agstem showed me...
... that we mst always be prepared for endless waves of transformation.
both of s deserve better than staying together...
... becase we're afraid we'll be destroyed if we don't.
my mother's stuffing. Stale bread, walnuts, got those.
will you get me some more potatoes?
Oh, I'm always getting you more potatoes.
it's my dream, a real American Thanksgiving.
the perfect way to say goodbye to our Liz.
so...
...you leave this week, huh? - Yes.
and where are you going? Iran?
india.
Liz is making us an American meal tonight.
you are not married, yeah? - No.
what's wrong with your friend, is she a lesbian?
no, Mama, she's not a lesbian. And she understands Italian.
how's she going to find another husband and start a family...
...when she's on the other side of the world?
if a man said, "I'm going to travel for a year and meet wonderful people...
but she's not a man.
it's more difficult for a woman to feel that she has the right to make choices.
it takes a lot of courage. - Exactly.
you call it courage, I call it stupidity.
mama, enough.
I know a number of people who would agree with you.
Luca?
what time will the turkey be ready?
the turkey...
I haven't defrosted it yet.
Oh, shit.
you only had one thing to do and you screwed it up.
I was distracted! It can happen!
too much good food!
too many women!
and I forgot!
now, before we eat, everyone...
...it is Thanksgiving, so let us give thanks.
Yeah. Come on, join hands. - Okay.
so we just say what we...
what we thank God for tonight. Sofi, why don't you start?
I am grateful for you, Liz...
...for helping me appreciate life...
...with all that comes with it...
...muffin tops and bad times.
and for Giovanni...
...for making me feel...
...Ioved and secure.
I thank God for...
...fear...
...because for the first time...
...I'm afraid the person next to me...
...will be the one who wants to leave.
Liz?
well, this all makes me so grateful.
seeing all you happy people...
...who know how to love each other and take care of each other.
I look at the amazing women I've met who I admire so much...
...and the great men, taking care of their women...
...and putting their children to bed.
I just feel happy...
...to see it and to be part of it.
I'm the luckiest girl in the world.
it's a good breakfast, huh?
I will take this to your room.
it has already started.
I fell asleep. - Yeah. Pity.
probably the only person in the world who ever fell asleep during meditation.
this leads to the meditation garden. - Is the guru here?
she's always here. - I know, but is she "here" here?
she's at her ashram in New York.
but I came from New York to see her here.
sounds like one of her little tricks.
the meditation cave.
it's open 24l7 and it's air-conditioned.
Corella?
this is Liz Gilbert. - Hi. Nice to meet you.
where did you get that button? - They sell them in the bookstore.
that is exactly what I need. I need something like that. I don't listen.
I never have. My mom used to call me Little Miss Chatty Cathy...
...because I just ramble. I am a rambler.
I am rambling now. I'm sorry.
silence is a wonderful spiritual practice...
...but if Corella could speak, she'd tell you it's more challenging than it looks.
wait till you've been here for a while. - Okay.
thank you, Corella. I'll be sure to tell her.
what did she say? - No idea.
change into your work clothes. I'll take you to your seva.
it's a Hindu word for "selfless devotional work."
it's required of everyone who stays. - Okay. Thank you.
is there anything in this world skinnier than an Indian teenage boy?
I'm Tulsi. - Liz.
where are you from?
the next town. My parents have been devotees of the guru for many years.
we spend a lot of time here.
but...
...they are trying to marry me off. That's the custom.
that's not what you want? - No way. It sucks.
I want to study psychology, just as our guru did when she attended college.
I prefer to be with God than boys my age.
no one in my family understands my coming all the way to India.
do you ever look at them and wonder, "What am I doing in this family?
you have no idea.
it is most commendable that you ended your marriage.
you seem like such a happy, free person now.
I think my ex-husband would describe me as selfish.
you mustn't be angry with yourself or disappointed.
you don't have to make children or be married to have a family.
Oh, man. They got mosquitoes here big enough...
...to stand flat-footed and screw a chicken.
I love you. - Liz, have you met...
...Richard from Texas? - Hello, Richard from Texas.
nice to meet you, Groceries. - Groceries?
Yeah. Yeah, I heard you eating before I saw you.
I never seen anybody eat so much at one time.
you sure do enjoy your groceries.
you know, it's been a rough day, and if no one takes it personally...
...I'm going to take my large meal someplace else to eat it in silence.
Oh, no, stay. I'm done.
looked like you were working through some...
...pretty rough stuff this morning.
stuff with your ex-husband?
I got an ex-wife.
she thinks I changed my name to "Motherfucker."
I...
I just spent some time in Rome and I came here feeling so great.
and now here I am, at the source...
...and I feel more disconnected than ever.
why'd you come here?
I just want some peace.
peace?
you wanna get to the castle, Groceries...
...you got to swim the moat.
here, you can finish that. I know you can.
okay.
simply empty yor mind.
breathe.
what am I going to do when this year is over?
where am I going to live?
well, maybe Chicago.
Oh, my God. I cold bild a meditation room...
no. Stop thinking. Why is this so hard?
screw you, Corella. How the hell does she do this?
she looks like frigging Mother Teresa.
Oh, my God, kill me.
who's in the moat today? - Shut up.
sounds like you wrestled some big-ass crocs.
you know what? If you're so goddamn smart, what are you doing here?
if you're here, it makes you smart already.
do you wanna talk about what...? - No, not to you. Thank you.
I'm the only one here. You're gonna talk about it sooner or later.
I cannot focus in there.
all I think about is my meditation room and how to decorate.
are you shitting me?
are you kidding me?
the meditation room is within, Groceries. Decorate that.
do you always talk in bumper sticker?
I do, and here's another one.
you have to learn to select your thoughts the way you select...
...your clothes every day. That's a power you can cultivate.
you wanna come here and control your life so bad, work on the mind.
that's the only thing you should control.
if you can't master your thoughts, you're in trouble.
I am trying.
Yeah, hello, that's the damn problem. Stop trying. Surrender.
go out into the garden and just sit there and still your mind...
...and you watch what happens.
why don't you just let it be?
has anyone ever told you you look like James Taylor?
every day.
God, he really does.
my prayers were always the same.
please, God, please. Open my heart, send me a sign...
...because we both know I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.
look at you, floating through Calcutta.
looks like you had a great meditation.
I probably have malaria now.
the bites will go away.
eventually everything goes away.
you ever done that, Groceries? Begged for a sign?
that sounds vaguely familiar.
be careful what you wish for. You just might get it.
what is your problem?
did you fall in love with the wrong woman or something?
excuse me, Miss Gilbert.
you have a phone call.
how's the Gr Gita treating you?
fine. You'd like her.
did you get my e-mail?
Yeah. I'm sorry I didn't call sooner.
why didn't you?
becase if I didn't respond...
...we were still having a conversation. I was still in it.
I'm sorry. We were just bad timing.
I just wanted things to be easy. We were good when things were easy.
it's not that I need "easy" right now. I just can't have "so hard.
well, you sound good.
stronger.
so do you.
Yeah, well, I'm an actor, Liz.
I got a part.
it's off-Broadway, bt it's pretty cool.
I'm happy for you.
all right.
well, I'll see you around, kid.
check you out.
I have never seen you so focused.
you need a Thums Up.
no, no. No lips on the bottle.
first rule in India is never touch anything but yourself.
Oh, good God. That's, like, five times sweeter than Coke.
I think it might have methamphetamines in it.
we can only hope.
I know you feel awful.
but your life's changing.
that's not a bad thing.
and you're in the perfect place for it. Surrounded by grace.
I thought I was over him, but...
...I love him.
big deal.
so you fell in love with someone. - I really miss him.
so miss him.
send him some light and love every time you think of him, then drop it.
you know, if you could clear out all that space in your mind...
...that you're using to obsess over this guy...
...and your failed marriage, you'd have a vacuum with a doorway.
and you know what the universe would do with that doorway?
rush in. God would rush in.
fill you with more love than you ever dreamed of. Man.
groceries.
I think you have the capacity someday to love the whole world.
what do they sell over there?
Ganesh. Remover of obstacles.
I'm gonna need a lot of these.
speaking of elephants, there's a rogue elephant on the loose in the area.
he was with carnival.
they say he is very, very unpredictable and volatile.
that just makes him more attractive to her.
how'd you get to be so smart? I'll bet it was the hard way.
don't change the subject.
well, when is this grieving phase going to pass?
you want a day on a calendar you can circle?
can you give me one? - No. You got to do the work.
meditate and go to seva...
...and most important, get your butt down to the Geet every morning...
...and something'll change.
I just cannot get through the Gr Gita. I can't find that feeling of devotion.
okay. Devotion's love. Pick somebody or something you wanna devote it to.
it doesn't have to be the guru. It's all the same to her.
this is about you.
can I tell you something, Groceries? You got some serious control issues.
is it obvious?
all right, Richard, get out from inside my head now.
shut the door.
that's him? - That's him.
he's hideous. - No, he's not. He's cute.
he's a Sagittarius.
he studies computer programming in Delhi.
he has very good grades.
and his family is very, very wealthy.
1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE 5: 28 PM
division
division TWELVE HOURS EARLIER
saying your good-byes?
more like good riddance.
my trip to Washington was very fruitful.
the president came through. We're getting our pardons.
should have them by week's end.
she kept to her word.
that's because she's afraid of us.
she knows what we know, what we could do to her.
she's one of the only people in the world who knows about Division.
she should be afraid.
Nikita, is there something you want to say?
now's not the time to do anything rash, Nikita, or I may have to do something rash in return, like push the trigger to activate the nanotoxin in Michael's blood.
I just can't believe the end is in sight.
Yeah.
there were plenty of times I didn't think we'd make it.
so you're okay with letting go of pursuing Amanda?
michael convinced me to move on.
Yeah.
now, that is what I call true love.
what did you want to show me?
remember when Nikki went hunting for Amanda in that aqueduct?
you mean when your comms went out?
Yeah, see, my comms don't just go out.
not like that.
I ran some tests.
there's nothing wrong with the tech.
well, maybe Shadownet's not up to snuff yet. Shadownet's got plenty of snuff.
it's got snuff coming out of its ears.
no, I did some digging
there was a jamming field dropped over the entire area.
jamming field?
last time we saw one of those, it was- - Amanda.
she used it in Colombia when you guys went after Ramon.
I checked.
it's the same power signature.
why would Amanda jam that aqueduct?
she didn't want us to hear something, or someone.
Nikita said there was no one down there, just her.
Yeah, see, that's the other thing.
Nikki was out of contact for 22 minutes.
that's a long time to be wandering around a supposedly empty aqueduct.
you saying she lied?
if the power signature fits--look, Mikey, we still don't know what Amanda did to her in that chair.
we've seen this before, the lies, the cover ups.
it's Alex all over again.
where is she?
I need more time.
my conditions were clear.
I gave you 24 hours to kill the president.
I need-- I need tactical plans.
I need mission support. I need a team.
no. No help from anyone.
you tell anyone, and Michael is dead before you finish the sentence.
listen to me, you bitch
this is not a negotiation. - I could't
they say every good plan allows for some unpredictability, but I confess, I fail to see the need to enlist as volatile an element as Nikita.
the group wants the president dead.
I want Nikita branded a killer for the whole world to see.
our interests dovetail perfectly.
trust me, this is how we all get what we want.
Ryan, you really need to see this.
this is Dr. Tolcher.
the scientist who developed the poison?
not just a poison. A nanotoxin.
microscopic particles that lie dormant in your blood until someone triggers them to release a toxin.
scientifically, it's an incredible achievement.
what's your interest?
this guy was experimenting on human subjects.
where did they come from?
in other words, human trafficking.
how does a guy like this get hooked into that world?
the Pormise of Nanomedicine
how does he get mixed up with some shadowy global organization that trades in innocent lives?
this is medical.
Yeah, Sonya, is Nikita down there with you?
no. - Has anyone seen her?
she was in Ops.
well, she's not here anymore.
Why? What's wrong?
we think Nikki's been acting weird.
like Amanda weird.
hang on.
someone just started the car lift.
she's headed up top.
where are you going?
to take care of a few things.
I'm in a rush.
is that what it feels like?
like what you have to do is so important that it just can't wait?
Michael-- - It's not real.
Amanda has gotten into your head, just like she did with Alex.
that's not it.
Nikita, put the gun down.
think about what you're doing.
this is--this is Amanda. We've seen this before.
Yes, we have.
I'm sorry, Michael. I can't help it.
she's in my head. I can't shut her out.
I don't want to hurt you, but I will.
Nikita, you can fight this.
let me help you.
there's so much I want to say.
not now.
not until we can be alone together.
I wish I knew when that will be.
sorry, Michael.
I can't help it. She's in my head.
I can't shut her out.
I don't want to hurt you, but I will.
Nikita, you can fight this.
let me help you.
something's not right.
what Amanda does isn't possession.
when I did the things that I did, my actions felt natural, the result of my own choices.
I wasn't aware that I was being manipulated.
so you're saying this isn't one of Amanda's Jedi mind tricks?
I don't think so.
Nikita's doing this on her own?
doing what? And why the act?
to send us a message.
Georgetown
Georgetown 9: 12 AM
Susan?
Janet Malcolm.
president Spencer's personal aide. We met in Toronto during the G20.
I arranged for you to get into the gala.
Yes, of course. How are you?
good. - It's good to see you.
you too. Well, what are you doing here?
I'm teaching a seminar at Georgetown.
the press department was looking for you in Toronto.
Yeah, they wanted to do a little media package on your close relationship with the president, get you talking about her impact on your life.
she has had an impact.
Janet, I'm glad I ran into you.
I need to ask you something.
I need to get on the President's calendar today.
today? - I know it's short notice, but I have something very important I need to speak with her about.
well, I'm sorry, but no one gets on the President's calendar that fast.
I mean, not unless World War III is breaking out.
and plus, the Secret Service would still have to pre-screen
I'm sorry. I really am.
but I'm not asking.
she said there were things she wanted to say, but we had to...
wait until we can be alone together.
wait until we can be alone.
maybe she knew we were watching her on security cams?
or maybe Amanda was listening.
when Amanda forced me to be her mole,
I couldn't tell any of you, because I knew that she was monitoring me.
that's why Nikki was acting so squirrelly.
Nikita was trying to tell us she's been bugged.
Tolcher's subcutaneous comm.
Amanda could have implanted one in Nikita.
Birkhoff, can you reverse engineer the chip in Tolcher?
isolate the frequency Amanda's using?
we might be able to use that to
to track the comm that's in Nikki.
Yeah, I think so.
you want to go play operation?
call in, tell them you'll be out sick, and get me on the President's schedule.
I don't have the authority to do that.
Janet, I found you.
I can easily track where your home is, your family.
Tracy. Could you do me a favor?
I forgot to put someone on the schedule.
a Susan Mason.
okay, I got a lock on the frequency.
it's coming from D. C.
she's in Washington?
I just checked the armory.
in addition to her Glock, she took a silencer, a PSG-1 sniper rifle and scope, plus match grade ammo.
that's a kill mission kit.
she told me Spencer should be afraid of her.
she was trying to warn me.
warn you of what?
she's going to try and kill the President.
look, I'm not going to hurt you, all right?
a construction crew will be here in a few hours.
they'll find you. You'll be fine.
you try to get by Secret Service without clearance, and they will shoot you.
if I fail, there'll be no reason to live.
Amanda, the president is inside the White House all day.
no chance to sniper from long range.
but I did get an appointment to see her.
I knew you'd find a way.
I still have to get past White House security.
I told you I needed a team for this.
not that you would know anything about needing friends.
Oh, I know all about how valuable having the right friends can be.
get me Stirling.
Nikki, I'm talking to you through your car's onboard navigation system.
Birkhoff? - No time to explain.
we have a very short window.
win window for what?
you have to get out of here now.
let me go.
you don't know what you're doing.
we know about Amanda's bug.
Birkhoff's jamming it.
no.
you can't. She'll know.
no, it's disguised as interference.
she'll think you went through a tunnel or something.
as long as we don't cut her out for too long.
just long enough to stop you from killing the President.
we know. We got your message.
I've lost Nikita's signal.
if you can't clear it up in a few seconds, let me know.
yes Madam.
we know Amanda didn't alter your brain, so what did she do to you?
she didn't do anything to me.
she did something to you.
the nanotoxin is embedded in the carbon fiber bone of your new hand.
if I don't fulfill her mission, she won't give me the antidote.
I kill the President, or you die, Michael.
I have to go. Amanda's going
there's no way I'm letting you go through with this.
what happens to you if you do? I'd rather
you'd rather die?
that's why I didn't tell you.
you can't just-- - What choice do I have?
why did you give us clues if you didn't want us to stop you?
because if I have to go through with this, I wanted you to know why.
what if there's another way?
we take the nanotoxin out of play.
we know there's an antidote.
no, we already used the last dose on Maryam Hasan.
okay, so we find more.
in the research, we found another scientist.
his name is Kang.
if anything, it looks like Tolcher was working heavily from his theories.
he may be able to make more antidote.
I can't go. Amanda's watching.
we can.
stick to your plan so she doesn't suspect.
we'll go find the antidote.
I can buy you some time.
Michael, if you want to save me, save yourself.
how do we know Dr. Kang isn't working for the Shop too? - We don't.
part of me hopes he's dirty.
at least I could punch someone.
Alex, look.
if this goes bad, I'm worried about what it'll do to Nikita.
make her understand that her family, the one that she's built, is there for her.
she started this journey by herself.
I need to know she will not end it alone.
she won't.
I promise.
excuse me. You can't be here.
Dr. Kang, CIA.
we need a moment of your time.
white HOUSE
white HOUSE
white HOUSE
I'm here on Commander Evan Danforth's orders.
you have anything about this?
this is Blue 1.
we have an unsub in the tunnels and are investigating.
lock it down.
this is...
this is outrageous.
so you recognize what Tolcher was doing?
he took my nanoparticle drug delivery system and weaponized it.
how did he get this?
the people he's working with have eyes everywhere.
so someone's spying on my lab?
possibly. More importantly, is there a way to counter the nanotoxin?
I don't know. Maybe.
nanocells are designed to mimic human tissue, so they can't survive without a live host for more than 20 minutes.
doctor, yes or no?
Yes. Yes, if I had a live, infected subject to work with.
well, you've got one.
these tunnels are classified.
how did you get access?
I'm a covert operative for Commander Evan Danforth.
he told me to use them.
commander Danforth is dead.
I know.
but my mission is still active.
I couldn't risk being seen going through a public route.
I have very important intel for the President.
regarding what?
for her ears only.
we'll check out your story.
I'm going to need supplies.
we have a lab ready to go.
why can't I just work here?
security could be an issue.
well done.
so Dr. Tolcher had you infect Kang with the nanotoxin?
Yes, sir.
a failsafe in case Kang ever discovered that we had been hacking his research.
excellent foresight.
let's--let's keep this between us, shall we?
Amanda might feel compelled to do something rash in response to this action, which wouldn't be prudent for anybody.
of course.
come with us. - Where are we going?
uncuff her.
return to your posts.
sir, we really should stay with
I said, dismissed.
I've cleared agents from the blue sector for the next ten minutes.
I can get you as far as the Oval Office.
you'll need this.
how much did Amanda pay you to betray your country? - I don't work for Amanda.
but the people I do work for want to make sure she gets what she needs, and this has nothing to do with money.
then why are you doing this?
be a good girl and take the gun.
I told you, Nikita,
I know all about how valuable it is to have the right friends.
then why not have him do the job?
do you really need to ask?
you're the one who has to suffer, so you're the one who has to take the fall for this.
now, no more excuses or unforeseen problems, because I've thought of everything.
Birkhoff, do you have a read on Nikita's position?
just give me a sec.
if I'm not careful, Amanda's going to figure out she's on a party line.
you find the Doc?
he's dead. Where is she?
just outside the oval. - Can you patch me in to Nikita over Amanda's command - without Amanda hearing? - Are you nuts?
if Nikita's signal drops out now, Amanda's definitely going to know something's up.
I just need a few seconds. Can you do it?
technically, yes-- - Then do it.
single shot to the head. Make it count.
ms. Mason, you can go in now.
thank you.
what are you doing here, and how the hell did you get on my schedule?
there's something I have to do.
I've settled everything with Fletcher.
you have no more obligation to me or the government.
this is about saving someone.
have you ever had to decide between two impossible choices?
of course.
but if you step back, you'll usually see that one is more important than the other.
Nikita, can you hear me?
Michael? - What?
it's okay. Amanda can't hear us.
do you have the antidote?
have you lost your mind?
okay, look, I-I don't have a lot of time, so
Michael, do you have the antidote?
tell her.
we don't have it.
Yes. We have it.
the threat's been neutralized. You can abort.
Oh, thank God.
I love you.
I love you, too.
there's something you need to know.
there are people trying to kill you.
a lot of people are trying to kill me.
I'm the President of the United States.
I'm talking about your inner circle.
one of your Secret Service gave me this to kill you, to take you out.
that's from my security?
Yes, it is.
I know who, but there could be more.
do you understand what I'm telling you?
do you know what you have to do?
I know exactly what I have to do.
get trauma down here now.
eagle is down. Eagle is down.
eagle is down.
I told you...
I've thought of everything.
eagle is down. - Lock down castle.
alert the M. U. Eagle is down. We need a trauma unit.
get the Vice President to the bunker.
initiate priority security protocol.
put it locked on.
use the tunnels. No eyes. Go. Go.
please tell me that didn't just happen.
it happened. It--it really happened.
the President is dead.
and somehow, Amanda was responsible for it.
this was all a trap to frame Nikita.
it was a contingency.
Amanda made sure Nikita would go down for the assassination even if Nikita couldn't pull the trigger.
the game was rigged all along.
but how?
could she have gotten in Spencer's head?
somehow gotten her in her chair?
Oh, how would she gain that kind of access?
and if she did, why not kill the President then?
guys, this is the Shop we're talking about.
it's got to be some kind of
none of this matters.
what matters is we have to save Nikita.
the Secret Service is going to be all over her by now.
that's if they haven't already dropped her in the deepest hole they got.
where are you going?
getting her out.
Michael, you're at risk-- - Screw that.
look, Michael, we will rescue Nikita, but you can't do anything if you're dead.
I'm dead already. Kang is gone, as is any chance of me getting an antidote.
and I'll be damned if I stand around while Nikita's in trouble.
wait, you're not dead yet.
look, I've been thinking, Kang said that the nanocells react just like living tissue.
they die when the host body dies.
so?
so what if the host body dies?
I get it.
we kill Mikey, we kill the nanocells.
then we revive him.
it's what Amanda did to me to deactivate my kill chip.
we don't have that time.
you remember what Nikita said?
to save her, you have to save yourself.
what's that? - It's to lower your body temperature.
we have to stop your heart for 20 minutes.
that's how long Kang said it takes to kill the nanocells.
the only way to prevent brain damage is to induce hypothermia.
preventing brain damage would be good.
you're trying to figure out why I did it this way, aren't you?
see, my associates needed the President dead, but they also needed a specific narrative.
so I gave them an assassin with an axe to grind.
from now until the end of history, every man, woman, and child will know your name.
booth, Oswald...Nikita.
you know, it's funny, I'm the only one who hasn't gone through this.
all of you have already done this resurrection thing.
well, it's about time you joined the club.
your story's not going to hold up.
you're right.
your testimony could confuse matters, which is why I can't allow you to speak to anyone, ever.
stand down.
there's been a change in orders.
sir?
return to castle. The suspect's coming with me.
no, stop. Don't listen to him.
sir, the protocol is very clear.
we're changing the protocol.
now turn her over. That's an order.
he's working with the people who killed the President.
agent, you've lost control of your prisoner.
will you shut her up?
this is Stirling.
I have control of the situation.
all agents stand down. All agents down. - Wait a minute.
he's on Amanda's frequency.
I might be able to overload the relay.
