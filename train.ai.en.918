Tommy. What are you doing here?
working. What?
you think you and jane are the only rizzolis that can look death in the face?
move.
all right.
how about you? Can you look death in the face?
and as we easily hold our balance, take your gaze to the ceiling and breathe.
with your right hand flat on the floor, take that left arm and extend it to the ceiling and reach.
as we move from half-moon ardha chapasana, into an easy variation king dancer...
if it's so easy, why doesn't she come up with something harder?
I'm scared. - Can you please stay on your own mat?
if you can't do this simple pose, just do adho mukha svanasana.
I'd like to adho mukha svanasana her. - I'll help.
apparent skull fracture.
holy crap, it's my first murder.
stop right there! I can't take it. I can't do it.
what? W - what'd I say?
this man might have hit his head when he jumped.
or slammed into rocks when his bungie cord snapped.
for all I know, wile e. Coyote dropped an anvil on his head.
it was just a gut feeling. I
this is a scientific process. Do you understand, officer?
you do not guess, leap to conclusions, speculate, theorize, wonder, or tell me about your gut. Am I clear?
Yeah.
clear.
I hope you experienced a little bit of love and light transformation.
words cannot begin to express.
Yeah, we're so transformed, we're ready to meet sensel matta.
he rarely leaves his spiritual retreat in western massachusetts.
but you said after - - It's a ways, but it might be worth it.
what's the address? - You can't know that until you ascend.
that girl, hon - What was her name? Rachel...?
Oh, rachel lawson, the one that told us about this place.
that's the one, yes.
she said she'd been to the retreat.
Rachel ascended very quickly.
huh. Must be flexible.
sensel matta believes rachel is, uh... Spiritually gifted.
I'll get you packets to fill out.
now that you're ready to ascend, you'll put a credit card on file.
Rachel's parents said she didn't have a boyfriend.
Yeah. Bet they didn't know she was "spiritually gifted," either.
I got a bad feeling. - Me too.
anything? - Yeah. A lot.
got a name - matthew moore. That's your sensel matta.
well, how are we gonna find his retreat in all of western mass?
what are these shaded areas? - I've been busy.
sensel matta yoga bought 20, 000 acres there, all within the last year.
it's all protected land. how?
using their nonprofit religious exemption.
now I really have a bad feeling.
I've also been through all of bcu's security footage of tunnel entrances.
Rachel started going in five months ago.
right after her parents separated.
then she stopped for months. Started going again two weeks ago.
I want to know what happened two weeks ago. - Me too.
last time was three days ago, the day she was murdered.
no one followed her.
there's a lot of tunnel entrances in campus buildings. Somebody was in there.
the victim's rash was caused by benzene and 1, 4-dioxane, likely from a fresh water source.
I've narrowed it down to seven lakes in western massachusetts.
are you saying those lakes are polluted? - I'm not.
the ph levels and mineral content are.
swell.
my sprout troop used to have sleepover camps at one of those lakes.
you were a sprout trooper?
Yes. Why is that so hard to believe?
you mean because it is your "duty as a sprout trooper to be kind, friendly, generous"?
I was so sweet and kind, I won "sweetest camper.
two years in a row. So, ha ha ha.
was anyone else there?
to watch you... Accept your award?
nice recovery.
the pollution must be recent because it's not showing up in any of the water quality reports.
bet you that's where rachel was driving that campus car to.
well, it's a small needle in a big haystack.
I am going there and doing my own water quality testing.
Hey! Dr. Isles...
since you're going anyway, would you get a statement from matthew moore?
goes by the name of sensel matta.
you can't have a medical examiner go get a statement from a suspect.
that's my job.
Hey! You two can go together.
I'm sure she's taking a different road.
there's only one. - You're right. I am.
I have to go get a few things.
I'll tell cavanaugh.
swing and a miss.
Where's your car?
Hey, mo, it's korsak.
Hey! My car!
what are you doing to my car?! - Uh, my job.
I don't know how many times I've told you about parking here.
I park here every day, mo. - Oh, not today.
have a great rest of your day, all right?
I'm gonna rent a car. - Yeah, me too.
don't forget your lunch!
what is that? - Mortadella on foccacia bread, with a little roasted red pepper.
Korsak put you up to this?
all I'm going through, and you two can't be civil?
don't you dare pull the annulment card.
he wants me to sign a paper that says I didn't want you kids!
ma, we're grown-ups. We know you wanted us.
if you're such a grown-up, then act like one and stop this!
just saw big mo towing your cars.
you want to borrow mine? - Oh, you're good.
one little thing for your mother, and you can't do it?
it is more energy efficient if we take one car.
fine, but I'm driving. - Why do you get to drive?
because it's an unmarked, and because I'm a cop, and becau - Just get in the car, maura!
have a good time, girls.
I am not listening to led zeppelin. - I'm not listening to yo-yo ma.
I don't listen to yo-yo ma...
...in the car.
Oh, that's right, pardon me.
yo-yo ma's just for the jacuzzi.
put your seatbelt on! - it's on!
the next lake is 42. 3910 degrees north.
longitude? Really? Can you just tell me to "turn left at popeye's chicken"?
there is no popeye's chicken in western massachusetts.
72. 3830 west.
the acoustic vibrations of hard rock have been shown to increase the risk of an accident.
did you pass gas?
no, I did not!
okay.
Hey, ma. - Are you girls having fun?
Oh, yeah, we're great.
Maura's having gastrointestinal issues. - I am not!
Jane used to fart on long car rides and blame her brothers.
did you just say "fart"?
have you listened to the audiobook yet? It's in the cooler.
what to do when your former best friend is a bitch
Really?
too bad it's wet!
have fun. Love you both.
Bye, ma.
our charles river floater is paul mcnamara.
he was a professor at waltham university.
professor of hydrology. Studied groundwater.
fracking is an invasive way to extract natural gas.
proponents say it will liberate the u. s. From dependence on foreign oil.
but my research indicates it will destroy the environment.
750, 000 views. wow.
popular professor.
not everybody loved him. Listen to this comment.
what does this idiot tree hugger want us to put in our gas tanks?
how about his blood?
somebody killed him. - We don't know that, frankie.
you saw the front of his head.
Oh, wait. you - You didn't, did you?
remind me not to invite you to my next floater.
go straight past the coniferous spruce.
maybe I'll pass a hemlock, too.
Oh, look. A homo sapien.
Oh, crap. In a guard booth.
love and light. - Love and light.
you here for the retreat? - yes.
okay, what's your name?
our names may not be on your list.
we - we just ascended. Today, in fact.
well, unless you have your double platinum soul certificate,
I can only allow you go as far as the public picnic area.
well, we understand.
love and light. - Love and light.
let's hope he doesn't run that.
there's the lake.
nothing gets past you.
hurry up.
shoot!
we need to leave. - No, I need to talk to matthew moore.
no. Listen to me. We're in danger.
those don't look like yogis. What did you take a picture of?
I'll tell you in the car.
please! Trust me.
Rachel definitely swam in that lake. And I know why it's so polluted.
I saw fracking equipment. - What is fracking?
it's a controversial process to drill for natural gas.
they pump hundreds of chemicals thousands of feet underground.
it pollutes groundwater. - You've got to be kidding me.
that's why we pulled a thelma and louise?
well, Jane, it's illegal here.
Rachel was a geologist.
maybe sensel matta didn't bring her here to sleep with her.
maybe he brought her here to help. - Yeah, but she wouldn't have helped.
her interest was in the environment. - Exactly.
so maybe she saw what you saw, she uncovered the fracking, and that's what
you okay?
I - I think so.
Oh, crap. My phone is wet.
what? What? Can you move your leg? - No, it's stuck.
okay.
get down! Get down! Get down!
Maura, get out of the car. - I can't get my leg out!
Maura, get out of the car! - My leg is stuck!
Maura, go! run!
stay down. Stay down.
go for the tree line. Go! Go!
I got jane's voicemail again. Cell service is iffy, though.
maybe they're yelling so loud, they can't hear their phones.
what is that?
looks like a partial impression of a shut-off valve, a big one.
you only find equipment like this in boiler rooms.
I think your floater was in the tunnels.
where we found rachel's body?
Yeah, I think his head was smashed against a shut-off valve somewhere in the tunnels.
we might be looking at a double homicide.
so, how'd he get in the river?
there's an outflow of the tunnel that dumps right into the charles.
look for a link between rachel lawson and paul mcnamara.
come on. We got to try to keep going. Come on.
we haven't seen them in hours. I need to stop.
okay! - What? What? Did you pull something?
no.
take it off. - All right, all right.
Oh, my god, maura.
your leg, I-it's hard, and it's cold. It's like a dead body. What is that?
it's compartment syndrome. - Well, what does that mean?
the post-tibial artery must have ruptured in the crash.
but you've been walking on it!
blood from the artery is leaking. The pressure built.
and now the blood is trapped in one of the lower compartments of my leg.
okay, bottom line it for me.
the blood supply to my lower leg has been compromised.
I'll lose my leg unless - - unless we get you to a hospital.
Maura, come on! - No, unless you do a fasciotomy.
I need something sharp.
what? No, maura, I
Maura, I'm not gonna cut your leg off with a nail file.
do you have sugar packets? - No, why, did you bring coffee?
I could use it to dress the wound.
do you still have your phone?
Yes. Yes. Why didn't I think of that?
that's luck. We can call 911.
Oh, it's busted!
the touch screen is gorilla glass.
no, maura.
I'm - I'm not gonna do this. - It'll work. Okay.
you're gonna make a six-inch incision right here.
and a five-inch there.
okay, just try not to cut the superficial peroneal nerve.
no. I can't do this. - Take off your shirt.
what? Okay, now I know you've suffered a head injury. And let's go.
to bind the wound. Okay, come on.
Oh, god, maura. Please - Please don't make me do this.
listen to me. Listen to me.
you just keep on cutting, okay, till the blood starts to flow.
Maura, I'm sorry. I can't do this. - You're a sprout trooper! Okay?
just - once you make the double incision, you massage the wound like this.
okay, the blood will be black.
I can't. I can't. I'm so sorry. I can't do this. I'm sorry.
I really like my leg, jane.
please. Come on.
Oh, god.
okay.
okay. - Okay.
all right. All right.
you ready? - Okay.
use more pressure. I'm okay. - You're all right?
I'm not okay!
Rachel was a phd candidate in geology at bcu, mcnamara is a professor of hydrology at waltham university.
too close to be a coincidence.
she didn't take any classes with him. - Nope.
any e-mail correspondence?
no. No phone calls, text messages, nothing.
maybe she watched his "fate of the earth" talk.
searching rachel's browser history.
hold on.
there it is - His "fate of the earth" talk.
so, she knew his work on fracking.
they were talking to each other.
I found a thread in the comments section between mcnamara and "rockrachel.
what's it say?
I have evidence of fracking.
can you meet today in tunnels under geo building?
that's two weeks ago.
looks like they met again...
the day rachel was killed.
meet me. Same place. 3: 00. Bad news.
where the hell is jane?
come on, maura, it's time to wake up.
I dreamt we were camping.
I voted for you.
can you turn the heat down?
come on, we got to get you out of here.
you won sweetest camper again.
I didn't win.
my leg hurts. Why - why does my leg hurt?
sensel matta, I presume?
and you are officer... - Detective rizzoli.
detective?
kind of stupid to drive a car registered to the boston police out to my retreat.
don't you think, detective?
get up. Both of you.
my friend's hurt. She can't move.
get her off the ground.
let's go.
it's all right. It's all right.
what if their car crashed?
try not to worry, ma. I'm sure they're okay.
the state police would have called bpd, Mrs. Rizzoli.
all right, thanks.
that was my contact in army personnel records.
Matthew moore is an ex-army ranger.
he was a blackwater operative, too. - Sounds like one bad ass yogi.
I don't like it. I'm gonna take a ride up there.
take a ride? They could be at any one of those seven lakes.
I got to do something. Jane and Dr. Isles are out there.
how'd you make the transition from yoga to fracking - Hard left at fraud?
this land is full of black gold - all from shale rock.
I just needed capital to tap its potential.
and a religion hide behind?
so you swindled vulnerable college students?
I was already a martial arts master.
didn't take much to repackage what I knew and sell it.
you figured out that rachel was a brilliant geologist, and you brought her here to analyze your rocks for free?
actually, she paid me for the privilege.
she was very obedient.
and she... Helped until she realized that you were destroying this wilderness.
she stole shale samples from me, gave them to an environmental conspiracy crackpot.
I guess you could say we were at cross-purposes.
I'm a homicide detective. Every cop from here to boston will be looking for us.
too bad you can't look behind you.
you'd have a nice view of the water when it comes through.
see, you're in a spillway for one of my reservoirs.
a few million gallons of water's gonna come pouring through here.
it's pretty toxic from all the fracking.
if I were you, I wouldn't drink it.
let's go.
come on!
come on!
try your phone.
I can't, maura.
it's busted, and it got wet.
call your mom.
tell her we're friends again.
okey, okey.
Hey, ma
Oh, crap, it works!
the microprocessor dried. yay!
maybe just texting. Wait.
crap. No. I - I can only send symbols. Son of a...
type 42-point...
okay, thank you, maura.
it's morse code.
nice job, maura.
what the hell?
that view is not okay.
Jane? Maura, you down there?
Korsak?! Down here! Help!
you okay? - Yeah.
we got to get maura out of here, all right?
the spillway to the reservoir is open. Hurry.
did sergeant korsak come on our camping trip?
great job with the morse code.
the coordinates put me almost on top of you.
watch her leg! Watch her leg!
can you walk? - uh, I can hop.
you stayed with her.
I wouldn't leave her.
Frankie, come help! They're back from the hospital!
okay, I got her. - You got her?
all right? - Yeah.
I spoke to korsak. They got sensel matta and his guys.
got her? - Yeah.
are you sure you're okay? - yeah.
let's get her some water. - Thank you.
so, I didn't tell my pop about knowing you-know-who.
I think that's wise.
you think I should tell my ma? - no!
Tommy, did you hurt her? - no.
no, no, he didn't.
my surgeon was very impressed with jane's incisions.
I always wanted a doctor in the family.
well, too bad. You got two cops and... - An undertaker.
no, no, no. No. Not doing that ever again.
I got three great kids.
I think you got a doctor, too.
Thanks.
and thank you for saving my leg, jane.
I think you two should apologize to each other.
butt out. - Butt out.
I'm sorry if you are.
okay, but I'm less sorry.
no, we were both jerks.
you were both assholes.
ma! watch your language!
and...
...I didn't really win "sweetest camper" award.
you didn't?
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
Eve? No!
Jane, stop playing with the doughnuts and help.
I'm not playing. This is playing.
I still don't get why you agreed to host this thing and why they don't bring their own clothes.
well, the convention center doubled their rate after last year's ...issue.
what issue?
she left a severed head in the hotel fridge.
Dominick, delivering the bread again.
I can't find a new delivery guy. Oh. I don't mind.
it's nice to get out from behind the counter.
Jane, you remember Dominick.
Yes! How are you? - Good.
it's nice to see you, Jane. - Good to see you.
you, um, you used to love fresh ciabatta rolls.
Oh, yeah! Yeah! Bianchi's bakery!
Oh, I haven't been there in years. Maura, you got to try one of these.
white flour only uses the endosperm.
it's awful to eat with you.
Dominick, whenever you get backed up,
I'm more than willing to swing by and pick up my order... in my new car.
what? Since when?
since I became "Can'o Espress'o's sales person of the month."
a crappy canned coffee gave you a car?
a Camry. She's beautiful. Wait till you see her.
is he with the band?
Hello, Dr. Pike. It's nice to see you. Detective Rizzoli, you look stunning.
hmm. Stunning? Thank you.
Oh, hello, Dr. Isles.
Hello, Dr. Pike. You brought quite a few things.
well, when you're a cutting-edge forensic scientist, you have an obligation to share that knowledge with your less-skilled colleagues.
the colleagues that can't tell the difference between a . 38- and a . 45-caliber bullet?
Oh, look! More cutting-edge forensic scientists.
hello. I am delighted to welcome you all to the "Annual bullet and blast injuries symposium."
well, this is real nice of you, Dr. Isles.
Dr. Billy Ray Higgins. - Of course. Nice to see you again.
I look forward to your powerpoint presentation on the pathophysiology of blast injuries.
Hey, girl! Um...
me? He called me a girl?
can I help you? - Yeah, take this. Goes in the freezer.
when I need, you bring.
Oh, not again! - What?
I-I don't know. I guess my phone number is close to some guy's wife's number.
I keep getting all these weird texts, like, "hon, pick up my dry cleaning.
hon, I think we're out of milk.
Dr. Isles, I specifically requested a special meal，steel-cut oats with dried-fruit topping.
this better be a murder. - Mm.
it is! Come on. - Excuse me!
have a doughnut. No endosperm.
Hey.
double homicide. - Looks like a . 38.
who are the victims?
husband and wife shrinks. No sign of forced entry.
no surveillance cameras inside or outside the building.
that's bad. What, you think we're looking for a patient?
maybe. Frost is talking to the office manager.
W... Dr. Eve Parker?
what, the Dr. Eve?
media's gonna have a field day with this. -Why? Who's she?
someone who hated children. - Jane, that's not true.
Really? She wrote "no womb for children."
she advocates childless marriages.
ma used to listen to her radio program when she was mad at us.
well, I am only familiar with the work of her husband, Dr. Rod Parker.
Yeah, did he hate kids, too? -He was an expert in delusional disorders.
Mm. Soot on the clothing. Stippling on the skin.
Yeah, his was a close-contact through-and-through.
hers was from maybe three feet away.
look at the way the bodies are positioned.
she's on her way out to the bathroom, which suggests our shooter was lying in wait.
maybe the husband was talking to the shooter, and she surprises them?
maybe. Or she comes out first, he hears the gun go off, runs out.
what... what we need to know is, were they both targets or just one of them?
office manager found the bodies when she came in at 7: 00 a. m.
did you get a patient list from her? - No. I got a search warrant going.
she gave me yesterday's patient sign-in sheet, though.
okay, so, Dr. Eve's last patient was at 5: 00, Dr. Rod's at 6: 00.
what, patients only sign in with their initials?
it's a privacy issue. - Well, thank you, doctor.
I had no idea grandly deluded people wanted privacy.
Hey, Maura, you got your tweezers?
look. It's a piece of latex from the shooter's glove.
latex has many uses ... balloons, pencil erasers, spandex.
okay, I'm going to guess that the shooter wasn't wearing spandex or carrying balloons.
I hope it's enough to recover a partial print.
a single bullet penetrated the left ventricle.
that size hole says it's in the . 38-caliber family.
Oh, bullets have families in Texas, do they?
it was obviously a . 45. Female victim also died from a . 45.
I'm thinking we got a different horse galloping here.
Oh, really? A morab? A mustang?
well, you're saying the bullet that made that hole is a draft horse, and I'm saying it's more like a Shetland pony.
this is waste of time. - I'm sorry?
it's classic murder-suicide.
but both victims died instantly, and the gun wasn't recovered.
it's so obvious. Kindergartner would know.
husband shoots wife, then shoots his chest, just has enough time to toss the gun out in the window.
it's like chicken whose head cut off.
Dr. Popov, human beings don't move once the cerebral cortex has been s...
I think you're wasting your breath.
I'd like to take this opportunity to unveil the most significant new development in the forensic world.
the particle-vac!
Dr. Pike, please turn that thing off.
capable of fully adjustable suction up to 50 kilopascals.
step aside, please. - Please turn that off!
we are here to advance each other's knowledge of gunshot wounds!
Whoa! Now look what you've done!
I'm gonna have to bill you for that.
Hey. Crime lab is working on that piece of latex.
maybe we'll get lucky, get a partial print.
Dr. Eve had a huge web presence. She just released her newest book.
no need to breed. Here she is promoting the book.
you can choose not to be a mother. You do not have to breed.
judge Allen denied our request for patient files and phone records.
he won't even allow us to get a list of names.
now what are we gonna do? - We'll go see Allen in his chambers.
Mm. Okay.
but Dr. Eve had a book signing at the literate mind bookstore a few hours before she was murdered.
that's interesting. - So is this.
Dr. Eve had a lot of haters. Here's a blogger with a big following ...
Valerie Miller. "Waak..." wives are about kids.
looks like she's aiming a rifle at our victim.
"this fiend hates your child "?This from a mother of nine?
she's sure plugged in to social media for someone who homeschools all those kids.
check out her timeline. - Translation, please?
Oh, she leads such a fascinating life, she wants everyone to know what she's doing at all times.
where was "Mrs. Waak" yesterday?
the "Literate mind" bookstore, where Dr. Eve had the book signing.
where was she last night?
don't know. She stopped checking in.
well, I don't think "Mrs. Waak" was getting a signed copy of "no need to breed."
don't you feel a little funny driving this? - Why would I feel funny?
it's the nicest car I ever had. Come on.
let's get these groceries inside, and I'll take you for a spin.
Oh, I-I can't right now.
they just gave it to you?
I have to do a little promotion.
it's voice-activated.
can'o espress'o added the loudspeaker.
can you hear me? Uh, yeah, Ma.
come see! It has voice-activated bing search capabilities.
cool!
Frankie, you look so handsome in your uniform.
Oh, my god. Ma, stop!
Why? Am I embarrassing you ...
Oh, my god! Somebody hit my car!
my brand-new car! What the...
well, I didn't hit it very hard, did I?
Oh, yeah, good. It's just a little dent. -A little dent? It's a brand-new car!
ma, take the headset off. -Uh, I-I... Shoot! I'm sorry.
I'll get it fixed. - Oh, you bet you will!
don't you look where you're driving?! -Can I just give you cash?
I mean, is, um, $30 enough?
are you kidding me?! Frankie, tell me she's kidding me.
let ... let me help you.
ma! - What?
come on.
um... how pregnant are you? - Seven months.
all right, all right. Don't cry. We... we'll call your husband.
Fiance?... ex. - Oh.
he dumped me. - I'm sorry to hear that.
uh, here. That's a lot of unpaid parking tickets.
thank you. That's why I'm here.
you're gonna boot my car if I don't sign up for a payment plan.
there isn't really a payment plan. - Then what am I gonna do?
I lost my job. My roommate kicked me out. I live in my car.
Lydia? - Yeah.
Oh, my god. You're sure? Lydia "Lydia"?
dad's fiancee? Lydia? - Yeah.
Yeah, I saw her name on the parking notices ... Lydia Sparks.
and you're sure she's pregnant? - She's out to here.
well, what do we do?! - How the hell should I know?
well, should we call pop? - No, she says he dumped her.
do we just not know him, or is he having some deranged, late midlife crisis?
janie, she's living out of her car.
what if that's our...?
our brother or sister? Oh, my god.
uh, isn't there someone the children can stay with while we talk?
maybe an older sibling? - My children are very well-behaved.
Yeah.
take a look at that. You didn't like Dr. Eve much, did you?
not even a little bit. - That's a pretty violent image.
I thought it made my point in a very visceral way.
so did shooting her. That made your point, too.
she's a despicable person.
I don't even want to share gender by calling her a woman.
but I wouldn't stoop to killing her.
Hey! Finger out of your nose. Do you have children, Detective?
I do not. - It figures.
how does it figure? - Your waist.
even you would have trouble finding a flattering bathing suit after nine children.
luckily, that's the only downside.
is that why you shot Dr. Eve? She didn't have stretch marks?
Oh, I'm very proud of my womb.
Oh, please don't show me your womb, Mrs. Miller.
okay, where were you last night?
with my children... and 20 other mothers and their children at my "wives are about kids" meeting.
it's already on youtube. Would you like to see?
what makes you think that coming here in person will make me change my mind, Detectives?
we need that patient list, your honor.
there is nothing in your affidavit to support your assumption that evidence of a crime will be discovered if I allow you to trample the rights of these patients.
all due respect, your honor ...
both doctors were killed in their offices, where they see their patients.
I'm not convinced.
absent a stronger link between your crime and these patients, this is merely a fishing expedition. Have a good day.
judge Allen, this is important. - So's the law, Detective.
we understand, your honor, but without those names ...
if you ever want me to sign another warrant for you again,
I suggest you leave my chambers.
Hey. Where are all your little "Dr. Death" friends?
enjoying a lecture on using silicone scalps for terminal ballistics testing.
mm, and you're missing it?
I know! Cause I needed to get away from Dr. Pike.
I think Pike is on the take. - What?
he is using his position to privateer.
he's... attacking foreign ships during wartime?
I think he is taking kickbacks to hawk a forensic vacuum.
Maura, this is very serious.
it is? - No! You haven't started the autopsy yet?
pike is handing out hats and pens and travel mugs.
that is swag, Detective. - I'll get our swag unit on it.
I need to know how to entrap him.
okay! Take it easy, Serpico.
can we please solve our double homicide first?
okay. Help me undress her.
think you can be childless and have a fulfilling marriage?
no. With or without children, marriage is miserable.
Oh, not so. Studies show that parents' happiness has remained steady since 1972, while non-parents' happiness has dropped.
did I tell you I'm starting a new organization called "S. A.W."?
that's a hostile acronym. - It stands for "stuck at work.
and I'm gonna be stuck here longer if you don't get on it.
okay.
it's a shell casing.
Where's the bullet that went through Dr. Rod?
which means she was shot first, then he was shot, and the casing flew off into her sleeve.
damn. No prints. Wait.
Thanks. Here.
come on. Not again with this weird husband guy.
look. "hon, don't forget your brazilian-wax appointment.
what ... I mean, how many times I got to tell this guy?
I'm not your wife.
Oh, forgot to tell you, Frankie met Lydia today.
you're looking very, very guilty. What are you not telling me?
I promised Tommy that I-I wouldn't say.
huh. This looks very sharp.
okay.
okay. But don't get mad.
What?!! Tommy slept with Lydia?!
I thought there wasn't any surveillance footage of the victims' offices?
there isn't, but I found a private security camera aimed at the building next to theirs.
thought I'd see if maybe the killer walked by.
and how would you know if it was the killer?
probably wouldn't. But I did find this.
smart, Frost. What ... that's a city car collecting footage of Boston.
Yeah. And it drove by the Parkers' building at 5: 56 p. m. yesterday.
what?
that's right before E. A. had an appointment with Dr. Rod.
check this out.
she's headed right toward their building.
you think we have enough landmarks for facial recognition?
won't know till we try.
okay, she's pretty close.
frost, the man is closer.
Oh, my god. E. A. is Eugene Allen.
judge Eugene Allen?
no wonder he wouldn't sign the warrants.
Yeah, because he's a patient. Well, maybe he's a killer, too.
you want me to go with you?
no. No, this one belongs to me and Korsak.
go get him.
you can't go into his chambers. You can't go in there.
how dare you enter my chambers? Why wasn't that door locked?
you're asking us?
well, stop staring and shut the damn door.
I believe I told you not to return until you had a stronger link between your crime and Dr. Parker's patients.
that strong enough?
did you kill him because he knew your secret?
Dr. Parker helped me.
I'm finally enjoying my life, my work,because he encouraged me to be myself.
behind closed doors,
I am Eugenia Allen.
okay, Eugenia.
sign these warrants for Dr. Eve and Dr. Rod's phone and patient records.
you think you can blackmail me?
you think you can block a homicide investigation to keep your personal life quiet?
need a pen... uh, ma'am?
thank you.
you have no idea how fun medical examiners' parties can be.
talk about the case ... you'll fit right in.
okay...
okay, so we got the patient lists. It's like over 200 people.
well, I'll take a look at the doctors' sessions notes.
maybe I can eliminate the nonviolent patients.
okay. I mean, I think that Dr. Rod was the target.
I think Dr. Eve just picked the wrong time to go to the bathroom.
for you, Detective Rizzoli. And since you're so good at stabbing people in the back...
I haven't reported you to the BBVB yet.
bullet and blast violation board. - Oh, my god.
Jane! - Hmm?
swag!
attention, all swag units.
we have swag distribution in progress at the Dirty Robber.
this is very serious.
you could lose your bullet and blast certification.
not again! - What, another murder?
another weird "hon" message. "Hon, waiting up for you."
guess I should hurry home since I've had my Brazilian.
I think you should tell your mother. - Where I wax is my business.
Lydia's baby might be her grandchild.
that baby might also be her ex-husband's bimbo's kid.
it's a good thing Tommy's fishing in the gulf. I want to kill him.
maybe that's why your father called off the engagement.
because Lydia told him that it might be Tommy's baby?
no, no, no, no. No, no, no. This can't be happening.
no, no, no, no, no. - Are you calling your father?
no, I'm gonna call Frankie.
well, you can't tell him he might be an uncle over the phone.
but...
Oh, it's so nice to let my hair down and enjoy a few Long Island iced teas.
how many have you had, Dr. Pike? - Not more than four.
or is it five? - Well, perhaps that's enough.
you look stunning tonight, Dr. Isles.
excuse me? - You're like a wildcat, aren't you?
lapping up that liquid with your delicate pink tongue.
please, stop. - I've been in love with you, okay?
since the outdoor remains recovery course.
What?! - But I've been desperately afraid.
I lost everything with my quest to develop the perfect forensic vacuum.
I invested everything in particle-vac, Maura.
everything! - Okay. Stop. Stop.
Hey. - What?
lady says go away, Pike. - Buzz off, Popov.
you have as much chance with woman as dead Dr. Parker.
no. The corpse has better chance. -Come on. You want a piece of me?
let's go. - Okay!
here, let me help you.
put up ducks. - These are "dukes," you moron.
Oh, yeah? - Uh ...
what the hell?! You call me moron, huh?
pike declared his love for me. - What?!
Hey! Hey! You two are drunker than old cooter brown!
Hey! Hey!
if you don't quit, I'm gonna whip you both so hard, you won't be able to sit down for a week!
thank you. - Sorry about that.
how's your, uh, case going?
you know, we don't have much forensic evidence. I found a shell casing, but there's no prints.
I've been working on this new technique I studied over in England where sweat can sometimes corrode the brass casing.
what, so you think you might be able to pull up a print?
I might. I can look at it for you tomorrow.
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you very much.
all right, party's over. Let's go.
and you're telling Frankie. - I'm telling Frankie what?
what do you want to tell me?
Maura knows about Lydia. - That's what you wanted to tell me?
no. Uh, okay.
it's about Tommy. And he, uh ...
I can't believe I can't say this. - He slept with Lydia.
he what?! - Maura!
Oh, my god, Maura, she needs your help.
Ohh, I don't feel so good.
this is Lydia Sparks. She ran into my new car.
it's nice to meet you. - Yeah.
can you tell the doctor what's wrong?
Yeah, she's pregnant with your first grandchild, and she's drunk.
Oh, god. - Come on.
uh, uh, let's get her on the couch. Okay, easy. I got it, Ma. I got it. I got it.
here we go. Here we go. All right. - Take it easy, Frankie.
okay. Easy, easy, easy, easy. Okay.
I like couches. - Yeah, well.
Oh, you're really cute.
uh, Ma, why would you bring a drunk pregnant stranger into Maura's house?
she came to the cafe to apologize. She felt bad.
so, you cheered her up with malt liquor?
we had dinner ... pasta, salad, some water.
Oh. I have to pee. - Again? Sh-she just went.
Lydia, are you thirsty? - Uh-huh. I'm really thirsty.
okay, Frankie, call an ambulance. - What? I need E. M.S...
get her some orange juice. -Can't she just sleep it off in her car?
she has gestational diabetes. - Well, how bad is that?
bad. She's slipping into a diabetic coma.
will you hold my hand? I'm really scared.
okay. Um...
it's gonna be okay, all right? W-we're gonna take care of you.
it's like my mother has a homing device for trouble. That's where Tommy gets it.
and we're throwing Lydia back in the pond as soon as she gets out of the hospital.
okay, but we're telling your mother who she is first.
I'm calling a family meeting. - What? It's not your family.
well, it's my guest house. And I only have a one-guest policy.
okay, let's see if we can solve these murders first.
w-what? Fine, I will get Frankie and Ma to the Dirty Robber later today.
good morning, Dr. Isles. You don't look very well-rested.
guess you don't know your limit. - You don't remember?
did you do something inappropriate?
now, if you'll excuse me, I have to prepare my presentation on entrance and exit wounds.
you look stunning, Detective.
got my fingerprint-enhancement device. You ready to try it?
Yeah, follow me, Dr. Rube Goldberg. - I'm surprised you know who that is.
Oh, Maura, 25% of the population uses the internet.
Oh, not fair. It doesn't count if you have to use Google.
can't get these in a forensic-supply catalog.
I put this together myself. - Never would have guessed.
so, the idea is the electrostatic charge allows the fingerprint powder to adhere to the brass casing.
Yep.
Dr. John Bond at Leicester university developed it. Classic electrostatic physics.
shoot, I'm only an expert in common electrostatic physics.
that's unbelievable. You got a partial print.
but there isn't enough ridge detail.
all I need is enough to compare it to a list of patients.
no tented arch on this one. - This one, either.
how many patients did we get elimination prints from? -110 out of a total of 203.
still got Detectives out there trying to get the rest of them.
what the hell?
what is it? - Nothing.
what?
that's my phone number.
I...
Oh, my god!
you thought I was one of Dr. Parker's patients? -Nothing to be ashamed of.
I think you've hidden your delusional disorders rather well, Detective.
he called you three times last week.
I wonder why.
Wha... no. Hey, Dominick.
uh, do you know how long you're gonna be?
this is my car right here. - Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry.
that's okay. - Um...!
it's okay.
C...can you just put that back on the rack? - Yes.
I'll move the truck. - Okay, thank you.
Hey, you know what? Why don't you grab a bag of ciabatta?
it's still warm. It's on the last rack.
okay. Thank you. - Sure.
this one? Yeah.
thank you so much.
I'll see you later. Thank you...
I thought this would help ease tensions in the family meeting.
what is it? - It's a talking stick.
they've been used for centuries by native Americans.
Hey. What's going on?
Where's Jane? She said we were having a family meeting.
she will be here any minute. Sit down, Ma. Take the talking stick.
I don't want the talking stick. I want to know what this is about.
well, uh, the talking stick has been used by many cultures to designate who has the right to speak.
which means the both of you have something awful to tell me.
is this about Tommy?
give me that stick!
because I have a feeling that I'm going to have to use this stick to knock some sense into your brother.
her car is still here.
she's not answering her phone. She left over an hour ago to meet you guys.
she did? Oh, my god. Where is she?
ma, come on. I'm gonna get you home.
I'm gonna try and track the GPS on her phone, maybe get a location.
I'll be back. Find her, okay?
no signal on her phone. Can't track it.
come on, think! We're in the middle of this double-homicide case.
we don't know if it's related. - We know Dr. Parker called Jane.
the dead guy? Why'd he call her? -Don't know.
wait, wait. He... he treated patients with severe delusional disorders.
it'd be his ethical obligation to call and to warn her if he was treating someone who was a danger to her.
put up the patient list, Frost.
and she was getting strange text messages.
someone on this list knows something.
Oh, this could take all night. We can't sit in here and go through lists!
okay, what about the partial print from the casing?
Korsak, what if we tried to put the two partial prints together?
the one from the glove and the shell casing? It's a long shot.
we need a few more points.
rotate it to the left just a bit.
that might work. Run it.
that's the man who delivers bread to the cafe?
Dominick Bianchi... served eight years for stalking and maiming?
he was Parker's patient. - You got an address?
it's just the bakery. - Oh, hell.
Dominick has erotomanic delusional disorder.
doesn't sound good.
so, he thinks Jane's in love with him?
Hey, honey. You missed your Brazilian wax.
you were the one who was texting me?
of course I did, honey. You're my wife.
you took off my clothes? - Oh, yeah.
do you like your new outfit?
Yes. - Yeah?
I love pink and ruffles and kitten heels.
Oh, good. Oh, you look so beautiful.
thank you. Dominick, um, my wrists really hurt.
is there any way that we could loosen these up just a little bit?
Ooh. Oh, you are sly.
no.
I'm gonna go out and get dinner for us. Okay?
give me something! Checking his financials.
okay, wait. He bought a bunch of computer equipment recently.
looks like he set up a webcam. Maybe I can use an inmap to run a port scan.
what, you think you can track him through the bakery website?
trying a telnet port.
Yes! I'm in.
he's sending this feed to his bakery so he can watch her 24h.
Oh, god, Jane.
that's her apartment!
no, stay here.
sergeant Korsak, I don't see Dominick.
damn it! She's not here.
I couldn't see everything in your bedroom, so I figured as long as I got it close...
are the sheets okay? - Yeah, they're fine.
I don't remember having you over.
you know the building across the street?
if you go up the fire escape, you can see in your window when you leave the shades open.
right.
you remember Hawaii?
Dominick, you know we never went to Hawaii. Yes, we did!!
we had our honeymoon there.
we kayaked. You surfed for the first time.
we went to that all-you-can-eat Luau with the pig, remember?
Yeah. Yeah, I remember now.
liar. Don't play me.
we didn't go to a Luau.
don't be like Dr. Parker.
did you tell Dr. Parker about me? Yeah.
I'm allowed to talk about my wife with my therapist.
of course you are.
damn right!!
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
Oh, baby, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I deserved that. I'm sorry.
Oh, god. - What's she doing?
she has to try to make him stay in the fantasy.
what if he comes out of it?
we have to find her. He's live-streaming, but he's smart.
he's hiding the I. P. address. I can't find it.
Oh, my god.
Jane. - She sees it.
I-I love computers, Dominick, just like you.
I couldn't use one for a long time, but I-I read a lot about them at Bridgewater state.
did you miss me? - Yes, I did.
no, you didn't. I wasn't there because of you.
I was there because of Emily.
what happened to Emily? -I will always love her.
he threw acid in her face ... blinded her. Oh, my god.
I read about you in the paper.
I liked you when we were little and you used to come into my parents' bakery.
you knew that you'd grow up to marry me, didn't you?
Oh, yeah.
wouldn't it be fun if we put ourselves on TV as Mr. and Mrs. Bianchi?
that's only for me. No one else can watch you!
where do you watch me?
are you ready for dinner?
if you're as good as I know you are, you can see me right now.
please tell me you can see me.
frost, find me.
please.
I'm praying that somebody can hear me.
tell us where you are, Janie. Come on.
tell us where you are. Please let somebody hear me.
please.
okay.
I hear, um, airplanes landing.
must be close to the airport. Less than ... than half a mile.
and ... and I-I hear a bell.
a warning bell. - The Chelsea street drawbridge.
chelsea street drawbridge.
and ... and I smell fish.
the processing plant. - No, that's not enough.
there are hundreds of buildings in that area.
frost, zoom in on the radiator and the window frame.
that's a cast-iron radiator, manufactured in 1890, and a wooden window frame from the same era.
so, we're looking for something built in the late 1800s that's still standing.
by the processing plant? They've all been torn down.
maybe we're not even close. -Please, Frost, please come find me.
I got a building on Falcon street ... built in 1891.
that's it. Let's go.
come on! Just eat!
no, thank you.
I would rather feed myself. - Fine.
starve, then! I heard you talking.
I know you were talking to someone! -Dominick, I was talking to myself.
don't hurt her.
I'm gonna have to make sure that you never look at anyone or talk to anyone ever again!
police! Police! Police!
don't move! Hands up, you son of a bitch!
Jane, you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay.
Frankie, get me out of here, please.
I got you. It's okay.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
well, the worst part was the outfit.
pink shoes. Vomit.
I think Dominick killed Dr. Parker because he was trying to warn you.
poor guy.
and Dr. Eve got shot just 'cause she had to pee.
I mean, that's just wrong. - In Dominick's mind, Dr. Parker was breaking up your marriage. And what a marriage it would have been.
did I show you my honeymoon pictures?
Oh, you went on a honeymoon? - My head did.
apparently, we missed the Luau. I always wanted to go to a Luau.
I'm thinking of freezing my eggs. -Okay, how much wine have you had?
not much. I just don't think marriage is for me.
but I'd like to preserve my option to have children.
okay. I'm gonna leave my eggs right where they are.
and we're gonna talk about something else.
like what? - You and Dr. Pike.
what a cute couple you'd make. - Mm, very funny.
very, very funny.
bet he's Luau kind of guy.
Jane, stop playing with the doughnuts and help.
I'm not playing. this is playing.
I still don't get why you agreed to host this thing...
and why they don't bring their own clothes.
well, the convention center doubled their rate after last year's...
issue.
what issue?
she left a severed head in the hotel fridge.
Dominick, delivering the bread again.
Dgh, I can't find a new delivery guy.
I don't mind. it's nice to get out from behind the counter.
Jane, you remember dominick.
Yes! How are you?
good. It's nice to see you, jane.
good to see you.
you, um, you used to love fresh ciabatta rolls.
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Bianchi's bakery!
Oh, I haven't been there in years.
Maura, you got to try one of these.
white flour only uses the endosperm.
it's awful to eat with you.
Dominick, whenever you get backed up, i'm more than willing to swing by and pick up my order...
in my new car.
what? Since when?
since I became can'o espress'o's salesperson of the month.
a crappy canned coffee gave you a car?
a camry. she's beautiful.
wait till you see her.
is he with the band?
Hello, dr. Pike. it's nice to see you.
detective rizzoli, you look stunning.
stunning? thank you.
Oh, hello, dr. Isles.
Hello, dr. Pike.
you brought quite a few things.
well, when you're a cutting-edge forensic scientist, you have an obligation to share that knowledge with your less-skilled colleagues.
the colleagues that can't tell the difference between a . 38- and a . 45-caliber bullet?
Oh, look! More cutting-edge forensic scientists.
hello. I am delighted to welcome you all to the annual bullet and blast injuries symposium.
well, this is real nice of you, dr. Isles.
Dr. Billy ray higgins.
of course. nice to see you again.
I look forward to your powerpoint presentation on the pathophysiology of blast injuries.
Hey, girl!
me? He called me a girl?
can I help you?
Yeah, take this.
goes in the freezer.
when I need, you bring.
Oh, not again! - what?
I-I don't know. I guess my phone number is close to some guy's wife's number.
I keep getting all these weird texts, like,"hon, pick up my dry cleaning.
hon, I think we're out of milk.
Dr. Isles, I specifically requested a special meal -- steel-cut oats with dried-fruit topping.
this better be a murder.
it is! Come on.
excuse me!
have a doughnut. no endosperm.
double homicide.
looks like a . 38.
who are the victims? - Husband and wife shrinks.
no sign of forced entry.
no surveillance cameras inside or outside the building.
that's bad.
what, you think we're looking for a patient?
maybe. Frost is talking to the office manager.
w-- dr. Eve parker? what? the dr. Eve?
media's gonna have a field day with this.
Why? Who's she?
someone who hated children.
Jane, that's not true.
Really? She wrote "no womb for children.
she advocates childless marriages.
ma used to listen to her radio program when she was mad at us.
well, I am only familiar with the work of her husband, dr. Rod parker.
Yeah, did he hate kids, too?
he was an expert in delusional disorders.
soot on the clothing.
stippling on the skin.
Yeah, his was a close-contact through-and-through.
hers was from maybe three feet away.
look at the way the bodies are positioned.
she's on her way out to the bathroom, which suggests our shooter was lying in wait.
maybe the husband was talking to the shooter, and she surprises them?
maybe.
or she comes out first, he hears the gun go off, runs out.
what what we need to know is, were they both targets or just one of them?
office manager found the bodies when she came in at 7: 00 a. m.
did you get a patient list from her?
no. I got a search warrant going.
she gave me yesterday's patient sign-in sheet, though.
okay, so, dr. Eve's last patient was at 5: 00, dr. Rod's at 6: 00.
what, patients only sign in with their initials?
it's a privacy issue.
well, thank you, doctor. I had no idea grandly deluded people wanted privacy.
Hey, maura, you got your tweezers?
look. it's a piece of latex from the shooter's glove.
latex has many uses -- balloons, pencil erasers, spandex.
okay, I'm going to guess that the shooter wasn't wearing spandex or carrying balloons.
I hope it's enough to recover a partial print.
a single bullet penetrated the left ventricle.
that size hole says it's in the . 38-caliber family.
Oh, bullets have families in texas, do they?
it was obviously a . 45.
female victim also died from a . 45.
I'm thinking we got a different horse galloping here.
Oh, really? a morab? A mustang?
well, you're saying the bullet that made that hole is a draft horse, and I'm saying it's more like a shetland pony.
this is waste of time.
I'm sorry?
it's Classic murder-suicide.
but both victims died instantly, and the gun wasn't recovered.
it's so obvious. Kindergartner would know.
husband shoots wife, then shoots his chest, just has enough time to toss the gun out in the window.
it's like chicken whose head cut off.
Dr. Pov, human beings don't move once the cerebral cortex has been s
I think you're wasting your breath.
this guy don't know his butt from a hole in the ground.
I'd like to take this opportunity to unveil the most significant new development in the forensic world.
the particle-vac!
Dr. Pike, please turn that thing off.
capable of fully adjustable suction up to 50 kilopascals.
step aside, please.
please turn that off!
we are here to advance each other's knowledge of gunshot wounds!
now look what you've done!
I'm gonna have to bill you for that.
crime lab is working on that piece of latex.
maybe we'll get lucky, get a partial print.
Dr. Eve had a huge web presence.
she just released her newest book.
no need to breed.
here she is promoting the book.
you can choose not to be a mother.
you do not have to breed.
judge allen denied our request for patient files and phone records.
he won't even allow us to get a list of names.
now what are we gonna do? - we'll go see allen in his chambers.
okay. dr. Eve had a book signing at the literate mind bookstore a few hours before she was murdered.
that's interesting.
so is this. dr. Eve had a lot of haters.
here's a blogger with a big following -- Valerie miller.
Waak" -- "wives are about kids.
looks like she's aiming a rifle at our victim.
this fiend hates your child"? this from a mother of nine?
she's sure plugged in to social media for someone who homeschools all those kids.
check out her timeline.
translation, please?
Oh, she leads such a fascinating life, she wants everyone to know what she's doing at all times.
where was "mrs. Waak" yesterday?
the literate mind bookstore, where dr. Eve had the book signing.
where was she last night?
don't know. She stopped checking in.
well, I don't think "mrs. Waak" was getting a signed copy of "no need to breed.
don't you feel a little funny driving this?
why would I feel funny? it's the nicest car I ever had.
come on. let's get these groceries inside, and I'll take you for a spin.
I-I can't right now.
they just gave it to you?
I have to do a little promotion.
it's voice-activated.
can'o espress'o added the loudspeaker.
can you hear me?
uh, yeah, ma.
come see!
it has voice-activated bing search capabilities.
cool!
Frankie, you look so handsome in your uniform.
Oh, my god. ma, stop! - why?
am I embarrassing you -- oh, my god!
somebody hit my car!
my brand-new car!
what the...
well, I didn't hit it very hard, did i?
Oh, yeah, good. It's just a little dent.
a little dent? it's a brand-new car!
ma, take the headset off.
uh, I-i... shoot! I'm sorry.
I'll get it fixed.
you bet you will!
don't you look where you're driving?!
can I just give you cash?
I mean, is, um,$30 enough?
are you kidding me?!
Frankie, tell me she's kidding me.
let -- let me help you with that.
ma! - what?
come on.
how pregnant are you?
seven months.
all right, all right. don't cry. we-- we'll call your husband.
fianc?
- ex.
he dumped me.
I'm sorry to hear that.
uh, here. that's a lot of unpaid parking tickets.
thank you.
that's why I'm here.
you're gonna boot my car if I don't sign up for a payment plan.
there isn't really a payment plan.
then what am I gonna do?
I lost my job. My roommate kicked me out.
I live in my car.
Lydia? - Yeah.
Oh, my god. you're sure?
Lydia lydia? Dad's fianc? e,lydia?
Yeah. Yeah, I saw her name on the parking notices --lydia sparks.
and you're sure she's pregnant?
she's out to here.
well, what do we do?!
how the hell should I know?
well, should we call pop?
no, she says he dumped her.
do we just not know him, or is he having some deranged, late midlife crisis?
janie, she's living out of her car.
what if that's our...?
our brother or sister?
Oh, my god.
uh, isn't there someone the children can stay with while we talk?
maybe an older sibling?
my children are very well-behaved.
Yeah.
take a look at that.
you didn't like dr. Eve much, did you?
not even a little bit.
that's a pretty violent image.
I thought it made my point in a very visceral way.
so did shooting her. that made your point, too.
she's a despicable person.
I don't even want to share gender by calling her a woman.
but I wouldn't stoop to killing her.
finger out of your nose.
do you have children, detective?
I do not. - it figures.
how does it figure?
your waist.
even you would have trouble finding a flattering bathing suit after nine children.
luckily, that's the only downside.
is that why you shot dr. Eve? she didn't have stretch marks?
Oh, I'm very proud of my womb.
Oh, please don't show me your womb, Mrs. Miller.
okay, where were you last night?
with my children and 20 other mothers and their children at my "wives are about kids" meeting.
it's already on youtube.
would you like to see?
what makes you think that coming here in person will make me change my mind, detectives?
we need that patient list, your honor.
there is nothing in your affidavit to support your assumption that evidence of a crime will be discovered if I allow you to trample the rights of these patients.
all due respect, your honor
both doctors were killed in their offices, where they see their patients.
I'm not convinced.
absent a stronger link between your crime and these patients, this is merely a fishing expedition.
have a good day.
judge allen, this is important.
so's the law, detective.
we understand, your honor, but without those names
if you ever want me to sign another warrant for you again, I suggest you leave my chambers.
where are all your little "dr. Death" friends?
enjoying a lecture on using silicone scalps for terminal ballistics testing.
mm, And you're missing it?
I know!
cause I needed to get away from dr. Pike.
I think pike is on the take.
what?
he is using his position to privateer.
He's...attacking foreign ships during wartime?
I think he is taking kickbacks to hawk a forensic vacuum.
Maura, this is very serious.
it is? - no!
you haven't started the autopsy yet?
pike is handing out hats and pens and travel mugs.
that is swag, detective.
I'll get our swag unit on it.
I need to know how to entrap him.
okay!
take it easy, serpico. can we please solve our double homicide first?
okay. help me undress her.
think you can be childless and have a fulfilling marriage?
no. With or without children, marriage is miserable.
Oh, not so.
studies show that parents' happiness has remained steady since 1972, while non-parents' happiness has dropped.
did I tell you I'm starting a new organization called "s. a.w."?
that's a hostile acronym.
it stands for "stuck at work.
and I'm gonna be stuck here longer if you don't get on it.
okay.
it's a shell casing.
Where's the bullet that went through dr. Rod?
which means she was shot first, then he was shot, and the casing flew off into her sleeve.
damn. No prints.
wait. Thanks.
here.
Ugh, come on.
not again with this weird husband guy.
Look."hon, don't forget your brazilian-wax appointment.
what -- I mean, how many times I got to tell this guy?
I'm not your wife.
Oh, forgot to tell you, frankie met lydia today.
you're looking very, very guilty. what are you not telling me?
I promised tommy that I-I wouldn't say.
this looks very sharp.
okay.
okay. but don't get mad.
What?!! tommy slept with lydia?!
I thought there wasn't any surveillance footage of the victims' offices?
there isn't, but I found a private security camera aimed at the building next to theirs.
thought I'd see if maybe the killer walked by.
and how would you know if it was the killer?
probably wouldn't.
but I did find this.
smart, frost.
what -- that's a city car collecting footage of boston.
Yeah. and it drove by the parkers' building at 5: 56 p. m.Yesterday.
what?
that's right before e. a. Had an appointment with dr. Rod.
check this out.
she's headed right toward their building.
you think we have enough landmarks for facial recognition?
won't know till we try.
okay, she's pretty close.
frost, the man is closer.
Oh, my god.
E. a. Is eugene allen.
judge eugene allen?
no wonder he wouldn't sign the warrants.
Yeah, because he's a patient.
well, maybe he's a killer, too.
you want me to go with you?
no. No, this one belongs to me and korsak.
get him.
you can't go into his chambers.
you can't go in there.
how dare you enter my chambers?
why wasn't that door locked?
you're asking us?
well, stop staring and shut the damn door.
I believe I told you not to return until you had a stronger link between your crime and dr. Parker's patients.
that strong enough?
did you kill him because he knew your secret?
Dr. Parker helped me.
I'm finally enjoying my life, my work...
...because he encouraged me to be myself.
behind closed doors, I am eugenia allen.
okay, eugenia.
sign these warrants for dr. Eve and dr. Rod's phone and patient records.
you think you can blackmail me?
you think you can block a homicide investigation to keep your personal life quiet?
need a pen... uh, ma'am?
thank you.
you have no idea how fun medical examiners' parties can be.
talk about the case -- you'll fit right in.
Oka-- okay, so we got the patient lists. it's like over 200 people.
well, I'll take a look at the doctors' sessions notes.
maybe I can eliminate the nonviolent patients.
okay.
I mean, I think that dr. Rod was the target.
I think Dr. Eve just picked the wrong time to go to the bathroom.
for you, detective rizzoli.
aand since you're so good at stabbing people in the back...
I haven't reported you to the bbvb...
...yet.
bullet and blast violation board.
Oh, my god. - jane!
swag!
attention, all swag units.
we have swag distribution in progress at the dirty robber.
this is very serious.
you could lose your bullet and blast certification.
Ugh, not again!
what, another murder?
another weird "hon" message.
hon, waiting up for you.
guess I should hurry home since I've had my brazilian.
I think you should tell your mother.
where I wax is my business.
Lydia's baby might be her grandchild.
that baby might also be her ex-husband's bimbo's kid.
it's a good thing tommy's fishing in the gulf.
I want to kill him.
maybe that's why your father called off the engagement.
because lydia told him that it might be tommy's baby?
no, no, no, no. no, no, no. this can't be happening.
no, no, no, no, no.
are you calling your father?
no, I'm gonna call frankie.
well, you can't tell him he might be an uncle over the phone.
but...
Oh, it's so nice to let my hair down and enjoy a few long island iced teas.
how many have you had, dr. Pike?
not more than four.
or is it five?
well, perhaps that's enough.
you look stunning tonight, dr. Isles.
excuse me?
you're like a wildcat, aren't you?
lapping up that liquid with your delicate pink tongue.
please, stop. - I've been in love with you, okay?
since the outdoor remains recovery course.
What?!
but I've been desperately afraid.
I lost everything with my quest to develop the perfect forensic vacuum.
I invested everything in particle-vac, maura.
everything!
okay.
stop. Stop.
what?
lady says go away, pike.
buzz off, pov.
you have as much chance with woman as dead dr. Parker.
no. The corpse has better chance.
come on.
you want a piece of me? let's go.
okay!
here, let me help you.
put up ducks.
these are "dukes," you moron.
Oh, yeah?
uh -- what the hell?!
you call me moron, huh?
pike declared his love for me.
What?!
you two are drunker than old cooter brown!
if you don't quit, I'm gonna whip you both so hard, you won't be able to sit down for a week!
thank you.
sorry about that.
how's your, uh, case going?
you know, we don't have much forensic evidence.
I found a shell casing, but there's no prints.
I've been working on this new technique I studied over in england where sweat can sometimes corrode the brass casing.
what, so you think you might be able to pull up a print?
I might. I can look at it for you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Yeah, that'd be great. thank you very much.
all right, party's over. let's go.
and you're telling frankie.
I'm telling frankie what?
what do you want to tell me?
Maura knows about lydia.
that's what you wanted to tell me?
no. uh, okay.
it's about tommy.
and he, uh -- I can't believe I can't say this.
he slept with lydia.
he what? - maura!
Oh, my god, maura, she needs your help.
Ohh, I don't feel so good.
this is lydia sparks. She ran into my new car.
it's nice to meet you.
Yeah. - can you tell the doctor what's wrong?
Yeah, she's pregnant with your first grandchild, and she's drunk.
Oh, god. come on.
uh, uh, let's get her on the couch. - okay, easy.
I got it, ma. I got it. I got it. Here we go. Here we go.
all right. take it easy, frankie. - okay. Easy, easy, easy, easy.
okay.
I like couches.
Yeah, well.
you're really cute.
uh, ma, why would you bring a drunk, pregnant stranger into maura's house?
she came to the cafe to apologize. she felt bad.
so, you cheered her up with malt liquor?
we had dinner -- Pasta, salad, some water.
I have to pee.
again?
sh-she just went.
Lydia, are you thirsty?
I'm really thirsty.
okay, frankie, call an ambulance.
what? - I need e. m.s...
get her some orange juice.
can't she just sleep it off in her car?
she has gestational diabetes.
well, how bad is that?
bad. She's slipping into a diabetic coma.
will you hold my hand?
I'm really scared.
okay.
um... it's gonna be okay, all right?
w-we're gonna take care of you.
it's like my mother has a homing device for trouble.
that's where tommy gets it.
and we're throwing lydia back in the pond as soon as she gets out of the hospital.
okay, but we're telling your mother who she is first.
I'm calling a family meeting.
what? it's not your family.
well, it's my guest house.
and I only have a one-guest policy.
okay, let's see if we can solve these murders first.
w-what? fine, I will get frankie and ma to the dirty robber later today.
good morning, dr. Isles.
you don't look very well-rested.
guess you don't know your limit.
you don't remember?
did you do something inappropriate?
now, if you'll excuse me, I have to prepare my presentation on entrance and exit wounds.
you look stunning, detective.
got my fingerprint-enhancement device. you ready to try it?
Yeah, follow me, dr. Rube goldberg.
w-- I'm surprised you know who that is.
Oh, maura, 25% of the population uses the internet.
Oh, not fair. it doesn't count if you have to use google.
can't get these in a forensic-supply catalog.
I put this together myself.
never would have guessed.
so, the idea is the electrostatic charge allows the fingerprint powder to adhere to the brass casing.
Yep.
Dr. John bond at leicester university developed it.
classic electrostatic physics.
shoot, I'm only an expert in common electrostatic physics.
that's unbelievable.
you got a partial print.
but there isn't enough ridge detail.
all I need is enough to compare it to a list of patients.
no tented arch on this one.
this one, either.
how many patients did we get elimination prints from?
110 out of a total of 203.
still got detectives out there trying to get the rest of them.
what the hell?
what is it? - nothing.
what?
that's my phone number.
I -- oh, my god!
you thought I was one of dr. Parker's patients?
nothing to be ashamed of.
I think you've hidden your delusional disorders rather well, detective.
he called you three times last week.
I wonder why.
wha-- no.
Hey, dominick.
uh, do you know how long you're gonna be? This is my car right here.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
that's okay.
it's okay.
c-can you just put that back on the rack?
Yes. - I'll move the truck.
okay, thank you.
Hey, you know what?
why don't you grab a bag of ciabatta?
it's still warm. it's on the last rack.
okay. Thank you. - sure.
this one? - yeah.
thank you so much.
I'll see you later.
thank you.
I thought this would help ease tensions in the family meeting.
what is it?
it's a talking stick.
they've been used for centuries by native americans.
what's going on?
Where's jane? She said we were having a family meeting.
she will be here any minute.
sit down, ma.
take the talking stick.
I don't want the talking stick.
I want to know what this is about.
well, uh, the talking stick has been used by many cultures to designate who has the right to speak.
which means the both of you have something awful to tell me.
is this about tommy?
give me that stick!
because I have a feeling that I'm going to have to use this stick to knock some sense into your brother.
her car is still here.
she's not answering her phone.
she left over an hour ago to meet you guys.
she did?
Oh, my god. where is she?
ma, come on. I'm gonna get you home.
I'm gonna try and track the gps on her phone, maybe get a location.
I'll be back. find her, okay?
no signal on her phone.
wan't track it.
come on, think! We're in the middle of this double-homicide case.
we don't know if it's related.
we know dr. Parker called jane.
the dead guy? why'd he call her?
don't know.
wait, wait. he -- he treated patients with severe delusional disorders.
it'd be his ethical obligation to call and to warn her if he was treating someone who was a danger to her.
put up the patient list, frost.
and she was getting strange text messages.
someone on this list knows something.
Oh, this could take all night.
we can't sit in here and go through lists!
okay, what about the partial print from the casing?
Korsak, what if we tried to put the two partial prints together?
the one from the glove and the shell casing? it's a long shot.
we need a few more points.
rotate it to the left just a bit.
that might work. run it.
that's the man who delivers bread to the cafe dominick bianchi -- served eight years for stalking and maiming?
he was parker's patient.
you got an address?
it's just the bakery.
Oh, hell.
Dominick has erotomanic delusional disorder.
doesn't sound good.
it's a serious psychiatric disorder.
he believes a stranger, most likely someone of a higher status, is in love with him.
so, he thinks jane's in love with him?
Hey, honey.
you missed your brazilian wax.
you were the one who was texting me?
of course I did, honey.
you're my wife.
you took off my clothes?
Oh, yeah.
do you like your new outfit?
Yes.
yeah?
I love pink and ruffles and kitten heels.
Oh, good.
Oh, you look so beautiful.
thank you.
Dominick, um, my wrists really hurt.
is there any way that we could loosen these up just a little bit?
Oh, you are sly.
no.
I'm gonna go out and get dinner for us.
okay?
give me something!
checking his financials.
okay, wait.
he bought a bunch of computer equipment recently.
looks like he set up a webcam.
maybe I can use an nmap to run a port scan.
what, you think you can track him through the bakery website?
trying a telnet port.
Yes! I'm in.
he's sending this feed to his bakery so he can watch her 24/7.
Oh, god, jane.
that's her apartment!
no, stay here.
sergeant korsak, I don't see dominick.
damn it!
she's not here.
I couldn't see everything in your bedroom, so I figured as long as I got it close...
are the sheets okay?
Yeah, they're fine.
I don't remember having you over.
you know the building across the street?
if you go up the fire escape, you can see in your window.
when you leave the shades open.
right.
you remember hawaii?
Dominick, you know we never went to hawaii.
Yes, we did!!
we had our honeymoon there.
we kayaked. you surfed for the first time.
we went to that all-you-can-eat luau with the pig, remember?
Yeah. Yeah, I remember now.
liar. don't play me.
we didn't go to a luau.
don't be like dr. Parker.
did you tell dr. Parker about me?
Yeah.
I'm allowed to talk about my wife with my therapist.
of course you are.
damn right!!
Oh, baby, I'm sorry. oh, baby, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I deserved that. - I'm sorry.
Oh, god.
what's she doing?
she has to try to make him stay in the fantasy.
what if he comes out of it?
we have to find her.
he's live-streaming, but he's smart.
he's hiding the i. p.Address.
I can't find it.
Oh, my god.
Jane. - she sees it.
I-I love computers, dominick, just like you.
I couldn't use one for a long time, but I-I read a lot about them at bridgewater state.
did you miss me?
Yes, I did.
no, you didn't.
I wasn't there because of you.
I was there because of emily.
what happened to emily?
I will always love her.
he threw acid in her face oh, my god.
I read about you in the paper.
I liked you when we were little and you used to come into my parents' bakery.
you knew that you'd grow up to marry me, didn't you?
Oh, yeah.
wouldn't it be fun if we put ourselves on tv as Mr. And Mrs. Bianchi?
that's only for me.
where do you watch me?
are you ready for dinner?
if you're as good as I know you are, you can see me right now.
please tell me you can see me.
frost, find me.
please.
I'm praying that somebody can hear me.
tell us where you are, janie.
come on. Tell us where you are.
please let somebody hear me. please.
okay.
I hear, um, airplanes landing.
must be close to the airport.
less than -- than half a mile.
and -- and I-I hear a bell.
a warning bell.
the chelsea street drawbridge.
chelsea street drawbridge.
and -- and I smell fish.
the processing plant.
no, that's not enough.
there are hundreds of buildings in that area.
frost, zoom in on the radiator and the window frame.
tThat's a cast-iron radiator, manufactured in 1890, and a wooden window frame from the same era.
so, we're looking for something built in the late 1800s that's still standing.
by the processing plant?
they've all been torn down.
maybe we're not even close.
please, frost, please come find me.
I got a building on falcon street -- built in 1891.
that's it. Let's go.
come on! Just eat!
no, thank you.
I would rather feed myself.
fine. starve, then!
I heard you talking.
I know you were talking to someone!
Dominick, I was talking to myself.
don't hurt her.
I'm gonna have to make sure that you never look at anyone or talk to anyone...
...ever again!
police! police! Police! don't move!
hands up, you son of a bitch!
Jane, you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Frankie, get me out of here, please.
I got you. it's okay.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
well, the worst part was the outfit.
pink shoes.
vomit.
I think dominick killed dr. Parker because he was trying to warn you.
poor guy.
and dr. Eve got shot just 'cause she had to pee.
I mean, that's just wrong.
in dominick's mind, dr. Parker was breaking up your marriage.
and what a marriage it would have been.
did I show you my honeymoon pictures?
you went on a honeymoon?
my head did.
apparently, we missed the luau.
I always wanted to go to a luau.
I'm thinking of freezing my eggs.
okay, how much wine have you had?
not much.
I just don't think marriage is for me.
but I'd like to preserve my option to have children.
okay. I'm gonna leave my eggs right where they are.
and we're gonna talk about something else.
like what?
you and dr. Pike.
what a cute couple you'd make.
mm, very funny.
very, very funny.
bet he's luau kind of guy.
my class, no running. Let's form one straight line.
I wish...
okay, kids, everyone in line on the count of three.
one, two, three!
michael B. I'm surprised I have to tell you twice. Let's go.
but, Miss Johnson, the statue is bleeding.
my class, everyone here ... now!
well, I think it would be cleaner if you just...
I think it would be cleaner if you don't make me hurt you.
Oh, go back to your autopsy cave.
I can't wait to see his face when he sees his new desk.
now, are you certain that Frankie has this in the sack?
in the bag, Maura.
Cavanaugh said it's between him and someone from another unit, so it's got to be Frankie.
are you giving him the Chogokin doll?
action figure. Yeah.
make him feel good on his first day. He needs a proper welcome.
we superglued your desk drawers your first day. Yeah. Yeah, they still stick.
Oh, there's lieutenant Cavanaugh.
Frankie's in a suit. - Somebody's getting promoted.
please let it be good news.
morning.
you know, it's a big deal when we promote someone to the homicide squad.
today, that honor goes to somebody who's been out there, putting their life on the line for a number of years.
please say hello to Detective Riley Cooper.
Congratulations.
sergeant Detective Vince Korsak.
welcome. - Thank you.
I'm sorry we met under such weird circumstances.
Yeah. Me, too.
welcome aboard. - Thank you.
homicide's been a dream of mine for a long time.
Really? Was part of that dream playing us both for fools?
Hey, I'm sorry. - No, Frost.
you never worked undercover. It's not easy.
Oh, so that makes it okay that you used us to get information so you could get the promotion?
Frankie, I'm so sorry. - No. C'est la vie.
Oh, you're smart. Now, I'll give you that.
it's not the best way to introduce yourself to us. Yeah, I know.
so, you knew who I was when you moved across the hall?
I was living in a U. C. pad. Stuff went down. I feel safer living near another cop.
excuse me. Rizzoli.
detective Cooper? - Yeah.
get familiar with these open cases. - Okay.
welcome to homicide.
we got a possible body dump near Grant Museum of fine arts.
Jane, give Riley your open cases.
I spent a year setting up that final bust. I couldn't afford to let anyone know who I was.
I understand. The part I'm having trouble with is...
the part where you lied on my partner and my brother.
I actually like 'em...both of them.
good. Then you'll figure out a way to make it right.
Frankie has a right to be upset. She did earn it.
I mean, she's been a Detective in the drug unit for five years.
disappointment is a dangerous emotion if it isn't processed.
I'd just hate to see him set himself up for a life of misery.
no, that's ridiculous.
well, read the research. And I'm worried about your mother, too.
she's knitting. - Oh, yes. That is worrisome.
I think it's a baby blanket. The yarn is a 50-50 cotton-acrylic blend.
okay, yes. Now we do have a problem.
all units, be on the lookout for a woman who is so desperate to be a grandmother, she's knitting a blanket for the baby of Lydia, the slut who slept with her ex-husband and her youngest son.
she's worried about what kind of future that baby's gonna have.
and I'm not? Lydia could barely tie her own shoes.
easy, there. - Oh.
let's turn her. - What, did you pull something?
I smell something...decomposition.
let's tilt her sideways first.
I cannot believe you can smell decomp in bronze.
well, it's a heavy particulate odor detectable by some animals for miles.
looks like the Venus de Milo.
I've been to the Louvre, Dr. Snob. No! Oh!
it's not bronze. It's plaster.
she's very cool.
a dead woman masquerading as a statue is cool?
no, the body...it's cold, and it's exhibiting signs of delayed decomposition.
so, she was frozen? - No, likely kept in cold storage.
so, "refrigerated," not "frozen." Got that?
the difference between 32 and 33 degrees is enormous, Jane.
museum was updating their electrical system.
no power to the cameras. - So, no security footage?
what about the maintenance crew?
the last guy here says he fished trash out of the water just before he left at 7: 00. She wasn't there yet.
whoever killed her went to an awful lot of trouble and took a huge risk.
okay, I think it sucks.
ma, you're like a truck driver since you started working here.
Hey. - Yeah, whatever.
I'm sorry, Frankie.
however, I think it's an excellent opportunity to start, you know, practicing recovering from disappointment ...
not now, Maura. - No, it's fine. I don't care.
I care.
what a deceptive little bitch. - Ma!
okay. Riley was already a Detective. You mean a professional liar?
she went out with me and Frost to get information on the homicide squad.
I think you should protest.
ma, come on. What's he gonna do, walk around with a sign?
that could actually increase feelings of disappointment.
Look...all right, you got to strap 'em on, take this like a cop, okay?
Frankie, come on. You'll get your turn.
no, I won't. I'm gonna be taking 911 calls for the rest of my life.
Ohh. Aw, Frankie, come on.
Oh, my god. What is he doing here?
good question. - Oh!
isn't he the really handsome guy you used to go out with?
the one that never called again?
Maura, just who I was looking ... oh, sorry.
that guy seems a little down. Maybe I should give him a copy of my book.
release your inner winner and win.
Yeah. - Nice photo.
Oh, thank you. It's on the best sellers list.
Congratulations. - Thank you.
detective, we should get started on the autopsy. - Yes.
uh, oh, can I...can I just talk to you for a second?
I've been traveling, promoting my book. I - I should've called or at least sent an e-mail.
Yeah, you should've. - Ma.
I'm having a book signing today. It's right down the street.
it'd mean so much to me if you could come. I can't.
and excuse me. We do need to get back to work.
Oh, it is going to be a long day.
I'm fine. - No, you're not.
you like that idiot. - Oh, shh! I do not.
Oh, please. You so do, too.
he disappears for three months, and now I'm supposed to just drop everything to be a groupie at his book signing?
I think you'd make a good groupie.
Oh, Dennis. Will you release my inner winner?
that's good. You should go.
how about I release my inner bitch?
any guy who spends that much time grooming is not someone you want to share a bathroom with.
did you notice the Cruella de Vil streak in her hair?
Hypopigmentation. She's got track marks on her neck.
it's a long-term junkie if she's using the jugular vein.
how long was she kept in cold storage before she was turned into a statue?
I could narrow it down to between 2 to 6 months. Oh, yes. Gee, that is narrow.
can't you find some freezer fuzz to help out?
you could store a body right above freezing temperatures indefinitely.
it took Dennis three months to take me out of cold storage.
Maura, let that jerk go.
I am trying.
she appears to be in her 50s. Cause of death was asphyxiation.
no dental care for decades.
so we can't identify her with dental records. And without hands ...
uh, yes. Thank you, Maura.
Yes, no fingers, no fingerprints. Yes.
I, uh...I checked VICAP.
I found four unsolved murders of prostitutes in Minneapolis,
St. Paul, Jacksonville, and St. Louis, all strangled.
were any of them put in cold storage before they were dumped?
no, but look at this.
all of them had their arms cut off and all were encased in plaster.
did any of them have the deep cuts in their face like this one?
no.
so, this one was more personal. We're looking for a serial killer.
forensic psychiatry research indicates that most serial killers are men ...
with overwhelming hostility and rage toward women, often their mothers.
and displaying his "work" means he has a massive ego.
he wants recognition. Frost, where were the other four women found?
two playgrounds, a T-ball field, and in front of a daycare center.
all locations used by kids. And the four other women were prostitutes.
maybe that's where we start with our victim.
Hi. You ever work bay village?
Yeah. What do you need?
can you take that around, see if anybody recognizes her?
Yeah. - Thanks.
make her work the open cases. I'll go.
that's a good idea, Frost. Detective Frost is gonna go with you.
what?
Riley's a homicide Detective now. You make it work.
fine. I am a professional.
good. Take Frankie with you. Remind him he's a professional, too.
you got any pants? - In my car. Why?
a skirt won't help you in homicide.
how's it going? - Fantastic. She's fitting right in.
you know, the head of the drug unit showed me her record. Pretty impressive.
she got long-term undercover, and she got big scores because of her work.
Yeah. I mean, she deserves the spot. I don't have a problem with her.
well, I'm glad to hear that, Rizzoli. You know, she has almost as much potential as you did.
but I'm never gonna see another Jane Rizzoli.
thank you, sir.
you think Cavanaugh was saying that Frankie isn't gonna get his gold badge?
Maura? - Ow! What was that for?
I hate to be ignored. - Dennis ignored me for three months.
Oh, my god. Like, he didn't even text?
Really? You want to know busy? Like, I'm supposed to be solving a serial murder.
I have never once had an inner monologue like that. Okay.
trace report is back.
the plaster is a common type used in construction.
I also found these burns on the soles of our victim's feet.
so, the killer put out his cigarettes. - Likely inflicted perimortem.
so, he tortured her while he was killing her. What else?
delivered one child via cesarean section, then had a tubal-ligation procedure.
healed scar tissue indicates it was 30 to 40 years ago.
so, I'm guessing she didn't want a house full of kids.
okay, let's go. It starts in 15 minutes.
what starts? - The book signing.
the one you're not going to?
I changed my mind. - I didn't.
the lab results are gonna take about 30 minutes, and I haven't had a lunch break in three years.
I'm not spending a lunch hour that I never take listening to Dennis "I love myself" Rockmond.
that sounds like a character from "the Flintstones."
Hi, I'm Dennis Rockmond.
Maura. Maura! What?
Hey, man, did you... - Did I what ... sleep with her?
Why? Did you? - Nothing here.
so, Detective, what's your next move? I'm just a lowly uniform.
and I've never been undercover. What should we do, Detective?
you could start by growing up.
this from a woman who practically showed us her nipples at "hello."
detective Frost, how old is the victim?
50s, maybe. - Could be why no one recognizes her.
Oh, I can't keep up with all this complicated Detective talk.
excuse me. Do you recognize her?
Oh, sure. That's Cruella. - Cruella?
Yeah. Evil-ass Cruella. I know 'cause she had that little skunk streak right here.
looking up "Cruella" in the alias file.
listen, Rose, when did you last see Cruella?
Oh, beats me. That was one evil heifer.
be yellin' at me from across the street.
Hey, ho! I got your tricks! What you gonna do about it?
did, uh, Cruella have any regulars?
Oh, child, she was lucky to make enough just to feed that fix of hers.
got a name...Rachel Dugan, 54 years old.
you sure you can't remember the last time you saw her?
Oh, yeah. I saw her 'bout three months ago.
I remember because I had just bought this wig here.
Ooh, it's kind of shedding. But, uh, how you like it?
so, here I am...
perfect childhood, loving parents, failing out of college and blaming the world.
he's a very dynamic speaker. - I don't like him.
when the person that I needed to look at was myself...
well, how can you say that? - Maura, he didn't even bother to e-mail you.
but he had speaking engagements...I took responsibility for my life...
but why don't you like him? - I don't like his hair.
or his teeth. - Shh!
so, I want to thank you all for your own commitment to releasing your inner winner.
thank you guys for coming.
thank you.
don't forget...your inner bitch. - Mm-hmm.
Maura, I'm so glad you came. Ah, Detective.
Oh, no. Not a hugger, remember?
Oh, that's right. Uh, listen, will you have coffee with me?
I'll just sign a few books, and then we'll be out of here. Please, please, please?
Oh, gosh, Maura. I'm just desperate to get back to our case.
aren't you? - Um, yes.
thank you. I can't.
okay.
great talk. Good luck with the book sales. Maura, come on.
it was good to see you. - You, too.
what is it? - We've got another body dump.
ride's been closed for repairs. 911 caller saw the thing spinning and called it in.
okay. Can somebody turn off this merry-go-round?
carousel. 1926 Spillman Eng/Looff original.
extremely fine, hand-carved horses.
Yeah, with an extremely un-fine, hand-carved corpse riding it.
listen, I got uniforms holding 'em back, but the media are going nuts.
can you blame 'em? Dead women inside statues is a hell of a lot sexier than a city council meeting.
well, we got to manage this. - We're working it as hard as we can, sir.
a killer who takes this kind of risk is gonna be hard to stop.
Jane, you've got to see this. What, another power outage with the security cameras?
no. This guy is smart.
the I. Q. of most serial killers falls between 105 and 120 points.
well, this guy is Ted Bundy. Look what he did with the security cameras.
he took out the cameras with a laser pointer.
crap. There goes my fishing trip.
six dismembered bodies, all dumped in places that cater to children.
this is ego, Jane. He wants us to know these statues.
these dead women are his creations.
what is it? What's wrong? - Nothing.
it just reminds me of Hoyt. - Jane, he's dead.
but he trained two apprentices. There could be another one out there.
my head went there, too, Jane. - Okay, Frost.
can you see if there were any persons of interest on those other cases with a tie to Hoyt?
on it.
same cause of death...asphyxiation. - Was this one refrigerated?
Nope. Death occurred in the last 24 hours.
cigarette burns. - Yes. I've noted them.
she recently stopped lactating. She just had a baby?
second victim's tox screen came back.
this one's positive for heroin, too. - Thanks.
I found evidence of scar tissue indicating excessive sexual activity.
so, another junkie prostitute? Maybe we're looking for a trucker.
could the first body have been kept in a refrigerated truck?
it's possible.
I just find it interesting that the majority of serial killers aren't reclusive social misfits or monsters.
I find it terrifying. I think the guy that shovels your driveway is a serial killer.
you do? No, but I don't know if even I could tell that he was.
okay. I'm gonna go show this around.
what, now? It's 9: 00 at night.
Yeah, well, I can't go home knowing this animal is out there.
Jane... - Yeah?
did you notice that I didn't mention Dennis? Yes, you did.
thank you.
we're striking out in bay village. I texted Rondo. He's always in the combat zone.
maybe he can help us. How's it going with Riley?
Oh, me and Frankie are holding steady with the grudge.
that's productive. - Yeah.
vanilla!
you see that? You ring, I come runnin'.
Oh, you workin' with the brother? - Yes, she is. Hey, Rrondo.
we think she works combat zone. You ever seen her?
Oh, yeah, sure. That's Chrissy.
can you give us anything more ... a nickname, maybe?
uh...I think...I think she goes by...
uh...I think she goes by... "Rainbow."
she services the, uh, hard-core johns. You know the names of any of her johns?
Nah, nah. They ain't too friendly. Jane, I think I got her ... Christine Sullivan.
wait, wait, wait, wait. That's my homey.
she'll be able to tell us. Kitty! Come on.
Hey, Kitty, hey. These are my friends.
somebody killed one of the girls in the zone.
Oh, no! Poor Rainbow!
um, did she have regulars? - Sure ... lots of 'em.
did somebody choke her? - How'd you know that?
it was "Bear." Had to be. - Who's Bear?
he pays you extra if you let him choke you.
rainbow needed to feed that habit. She'd do anything.
can you give us a description? White? Black?
a white guy. - Did you see his vehicle?
he drives a blue pickup. Did you ever see anything in the back of the truck?
tools and things. I think he does construction.
construction. Plaster, Frost.
okay. Thanks, Rondo. Thank you, Kitty.
so, let's put a bolo out. We'll check construction sites tomorrow.
I haven't been training this bonsai. It's getting too big.
Oh, you should try knitting. It's very soothing.
unless you're knitting it for a baby that could be your husband's love child or your first grandchild.
Oh, Angela, I'm so sorry. - I wish I could just walk away.
but that baby didn't have anything to do with how he or she got made.
are you expecting someone? - It might be Amazon.
I ordered some more of this soft yarn. They deliver late.
Dennis. - Hi.
I know it's late. I couldn't sleep.
I need to tell you something. - Okay. Come in.
Oh. Hello. - Hey. Good night.
uh...it's for you. - Thank you.
well, you know, the day you saved me...
literally brought me back to life on that autopsy table...
all I planned to do was thank you.
you did thank me.
and I'm a doctor, Dennis, so you don't owe me anything.
I know. It's...it's not that. It's...
look, it's...
my parents, they have the perfect marriage...
30 years and they're still in love. They're soulmates.
why are you telling me this?
I was so knocked over by you that... that I got afraid.
and I jumped on a plane. I buried myself in work.
I tried everything not to think about you.
you did? - Yeah. I did.
I want what my parents have, and I never thought that I'd find it. But...
with you...
...it feels possible.
well, you either got a lot of sleep, or you did some "sleeping" that didn't involve sleeping.
Dennis stopped by. - Mm-hmm.
but I didn't sleep with him. I haven't slept with him.
the last time, it was because, um, well, I hadn't made my bed.
what stopped you this time? What, visible dust bunnies?
good. Keep playing hard-to-get. Okay, they picked up our suspect and his vehicle.
Todd Brown, nicknamed "Bear.
Oh, I always wanted a good nickname. - What's wrong with "Poindexter"?
the same thing that's wrong with "Roly-poly" Rizzoli.
all right, well, come on. I need you to observe Mr. Bear.
what? I have work to do downstairs.
please? You're the one with the degree in forensic psychiatry.
no, I did one clinical rotation in behavioral neuroscience.
that's one more than me. We need to determine if this guy is our serial killer.
I should examine him in a medical setting.
get in!
you can't do this...arrest me and seize my truck!
I think we just did. Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.
we've got a little time while our team tears your truck apart.
I got to tell you, Mr. Brown, we really admire your work.
don't show me dead hookers. - I didn't say they were hookers.
we have a witness who's seen you with this hooker, Christine Sullivan.
so? I've been with a lot of hookers, and I'm not looking at their faces.
besides, I got back problems. I can't even lift my own toolbox right now.
I'm not out there cutting up hookers.
excuse me while I consult with my colleague.
what do you think? Well, he seems to be rationalizing maladaptive behavior.
what does that mean? Well, psychopaths have a sparse emotional life.
he doesn't appear to be a psychopath. His emotions feel genuine.
he threw construction tools at the officers who arrested him.
I mean, that says he's easily provoked and violent.
ask him about his nickname. - Okay.
Where'd you get the nickname "Bear?" When I was a kid, I looked really cuddly and chubby.
and when some kid called me "bear," I beat the living crap out of him.
name stuck. - Okay, Bear.
we're charging you with assault with a deadly weapon.
What?!
the trowel that you threw at the two officers? That's against the law.
we found plaster of paris in the back of his truck.
we have hookers who can testify he choked them.
we need to know if he has any connection to Charles Hoyt.
Hoyt liked to have other nut jobs kill for him.
Plus, Brown was in the military. I'm gonna run his records.
I'll check credit cards.
maybe we can tie him to cities where we had body dumps.
Jane, what is it? - Uh, looks like a letter from the killer.
dear boss, do you like my work?
make sure you don't give the wrong sculptor credit. I'm about to sculpt my finest piece of work.
we got another body.
what? Where? - The zoo.
Oh, I can see the headlines now...
medical examiner sniffs out clues.
heavy particulate odor. There is definitely a body inside.
that is why we're here.
you're not gonna believe this. He took out the security cameras again.
how the hell is he doing this right under our noses?
what is it, Frost?
I just got an e-mail from a St. Paul homicide Detective working their dismembered prostitute case.
And? Any connection to Hoyt? - His name is Frederick Stone.
you're scaring me, Frost. Cut to the chase.
Frederick Stone once shared a cell with Charles Hoyt.
I'm not seeing any bruising to indicate that this victim fought back.
same as the other two...probably because they were nodding out on heroin.
maybe she was, too. Here's the tox screen on the third victim.
Thanks.
not heroin. But she tested positive for very high levels of cocaine.
well, that doesn't make any sense.
cocaine would make her agitated, so why wouldn't she fight back?
unless she was given a sedative.
Susie, run a wider panel. Check for sedatives.
latent checked. Trace checked. DNA lab checked. There's nothing on the letter or the envelope.
told you he was smart. That's why we have seven bodies.
Maura, there has to be a way to figure out how long Cruella was in cold storage.
two to six months is...is a pretty big window.
well, there's no traces of mold, which indicate that she was kept in a controlled environment at exactly 33 degrees.
so, the window could actually be much larger...
several weeks to many months.
did you make it larger because I said I hated Dennis' hair?
no.
possibly. - Hives.
serves you right.
so, maybe Frederick killed Cruella, stuck her in a refrigerator, and then went on a killing spree.
one per city till he got back to Boston?
this does seem like home.
what? - What is it?
can you guys keep this moving? Something's up with my mother.
Whoa! Relax. Breathe. - Oh, it hurts!
Jane! Help! I think Lydia is going into labor.
a maternity ward's a great place to have a baby.
you want me to call your mom, have her meet you there? No, no, no. She hates kids, especially babies.
and there is no way I am going to a hospital.
she already sent away a team of paramedics. I left a message for Tommy to tell him to get over here.
it's his baby. He has to know. - What if it's Dad's?
Oh, he tore up his parent card when he slept with someone younger than us.
I want my baby to be born with his family.
okay, we need to get her to a hospital. - Oh, no. I am an adult.
you cannot make me go there if I don't want to.
this is not your family. Why did you come here?
it's my baby's family, and you're such good people.
my little baby didn't do anything wrong.
Frankie, you pulled me off a car-washing job.
what's the emergency? You lose your handcuffs?
uh, hey. Uh, good to see you.
Oh, my gosh. False alarm.
Oh, Mrs. Rizzoli, do you think you could forgive me?
I'd love a hamburger. - Oh, me, too.
okay. I'm a little conflicted here, okay?
you had intimate relationships with both Tommy and my creep of an ex-husband, and you never bothered to tell me who you were when we met?
Oh, I can see why you don't want to get her a burger, but what did I do?
that! - I didn't do that.
did I do that? - Maybe...
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Rizzoli, you know?
but now that I'm bringing a new life into this world, I'm gonna turn over a new leaf.
and what about you, Thomas?
well, I'm definitely wearing condoms from now on.
okay, as a sign of goodwill, I'm...I'm gonna make you both burgers.
but nobody is gonna call me "grandma" until I know who the father of that baby is.
what?
so, what's the plan now, dad? - I don't know. Huh?
maybe I could get a job painting houses.
Oh! Yeah! He's totally ready to become a father.
wait, whoa, whoa. Where are you going? I'm sorry, Frankie.
I got three dead women, okay? I'm going back to my case.
no. Jane. Jane!
Oh, my god. You scared me.
I am so sorry. I - I...
it's probably not okay that I came through the back, is it?
well, now that you have, why did you?
well, it's my birthday. - Happy birthday.
and I-I needed to come here today.
I wanted to relive the highest and the lowest parts of my year.
this is, uh...this is where they wheeled me in.
you'd been declared dead.
Yeah.
if it wasn't for you, I'd be in the ground.
I'm...I'm sure you probably can't, but...
but what?
I would give anything to celebrate my birthday with you.
uh, well, I'm...I'm actually waiting on some results.
birthday dinner? - Wow. Yes. That...wow.
that would be...that would be incredible.
got an I. D. on the third victim...21-year-old Debbie Rowlings.
prostitute? - Yeah.
she was also arrested for child endangerment.
her newborn was taken from her a few weeks ago. Another new mother.
frost, did the other four victims all have children?
Yeah. Looks like it.
so, our killer deeply resents mothers.
all the drop locations are symbolic to him and seem like a big "'f' you" to mothers and children.
why cut off their arms and pose them like statues?
well, the Venus de Milo is aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty.
it says here the arms broke off and the draping's supposed to make her more sensual and erotic.
so, in our killer's mind, she's some crazy mixed-up symbol of love and eroticism.
all right. Come on in. - Thank you.
Oh, wow. What a gorgeous space.
the one thing I hate about my job is having to be gone from here.
you have a private elevator. Yeah, sorry we had to take the stairs.
I have to get it repaired. Oh, careful.
wouldn't want you falling three stories.
so, how old are you today? - 36.
Yeah, my mom called me this morning to remind me.
she always calls me first thing and sings me "happy birthday."
that's very sweet.
Yeah. I couldn't ask for a better mother.
Cheers. - Cheers.
Thanks. Jane, good news.
Frederick Stone turned up. - Where?
arrested two nights ago in Denver on a D. U.I.
still there. Couldn't post bail. - So, he's not our killer.
Nope. And Todd Brown isn't our killer.
okay. All of our victims had really young children except for Rachel Dugan, A. K.A. Cruella, who's much older than everybody else.
what do we know about her kid? - Think it was a son.
Yeah, right here...Mark Dugan. He'd be 36 now.
what happened to him? Says he was taken away from her after repeated episodes of abuse.
she ever burn him with cigarettes?
Yeah. On the soles of his feet.
we need to find him. He was made a ward of the state when he was 5.
keep digging, guys. I'm sorry. I got to take care of something.
don't you touch me! Don't you friggin' touch me!
Ohh! - I called Maura. She's not answering.
Oh, god. - Oh, god! Get it out!
okay, Lydia, Lydia, Lydia, let's let the nice paramedics take you to the hospital.
no!! - Geez, this girl's got some pipes.
okay, okay. I think the baby is coming.
listen. Lydia, push. - No, Lydia, don't push!
it's really stuck! Tommy, help! - Okay, okay. Is that it?
Oh, geez!
okay, now she wants someone with medical training. Get in there.
where are you going? - Away from that!
Aw, come on...find anything on Mark Dugan?
should we do something? - Babies are born every day.
we got a serial killer on the loose. You turn around.
I don't need you passing out. What'd you find on Dugan?
you want to talk...You want to talk about that right now?
what?
she's between contractions. Talk fast.
well, he bounced around from foster home to foster home.
lots of abuse. He ran away at 8 and found his working-girl, drug-addicted mother.
she abused him some more before she dragged him back to another foster home.
Whoa! - Everything okay?
Yeah. Fine. - Uh, okay.
one of the senior criminalists was looking for you. Tox results are back on the third victim.
do you have them? - Nobody knows me down there.
I'll see you upstairs. - Okay.
come on. I'll introduce you to everybody. Don't you want to know if it's a boy or a girl?
why don't you text me when you find out who the father is?
come on, pop. Let's go. - Go where?
so, I try to make sure that I can be here whenever Dr. Isles does an autopsy.
Maura? - Hello, Detective.
I have the results on the additional tox screen.
Oh, great. Thanks. Uh, this is Detective Cooper.
she just joined homicide. Where's Dr. Isles?
Oh, I-I think she stepped out to have dinner with Mr. Rockmond.
you found Inderal in the third victim's system?
Oh, no. - What is it?
inderal was used as a sedative so the killer could kill our third victim.
Dennis Rockmond nearly died of an inderal overdose.
I still don't understand.
and... he sculpted this hand for Maura.
Riley, get all units to Dennis Rockmond's address!
frost, get Korsak! Meet me outside...now!
classic art idealized the human form, but artists often didn't understand key aspects, like the layering of intercostal muscles. You do.
I take tremendous pride in everything I do.
that's probably why you're such a wonderful public speaker.
come here. Let me show you my work.
dugan, get your hands off of her!
Maura, you okay? - What are you doing?
look behind you, Maura.
you see that pedestal, Maura? - Don't you dare cut her throat!
see that? Oh, that's where I do my real work.
you were gonna be my next creation. I was gonna honor you.
just like my mother, you gave me life.
you must think you're real smart, huh, Detective?
no, no, no. No. We're just lucky. You're much smarter than us.
you're damn right.
not even the genius Dr. Isles could keep up with me.
please, please!
are you begging me, huh? Keep begging.
God, I like it when they beg. - Oh, my god!
no, no, wait, wait, wait! Look, look, look.
we're all in your hands, okay? We're all in your hands.
you find my mother's hand? - Yeah.
you understand why I had to take both of them, right? So she couldn't hurt you anymore.
I left my creations at all the places that I wanted to go with my Mommy.
wait! W-w-wait! Why hurt Maura? Come on.
because her healing hands brought me back to this Earth! That's why!
Oh, my god!
and now mothers maybe will finally listen...
treat your kids right.
because you never know who they'll grow up to be.
Oh, my god! - No!
it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
Oh, god.
no. How could I not know? - No. Come on. Listen.
he evaded four different jurisdictions, okay?
including us. Okay? You said it yourself...
they're not all reclusive monsters, okay?
you couldn't have known. You couldn't have known. Oh, god. I should've known...
you haven't said a word in over an hour, Maura.
I'm just trying to process the worst day of my life.
stop beating yourself up, Maura.
we all met him. None of us spotted him.
you know, the best behavioral psychiatrists in the world will tell you that serial killers get away with it because they appear so normal.
why couldn't you two do something else for a living?
I thought about being a ballerina.
and then I wanted to be a goalie in the NHL.
Oh, that must be my yarn. - My god, woman.
how much yarn do you need for a baby blanket?
and speaking of babies I guess I have to ask, girl or boy?
is it the yarn?
it's Lydia's baby.
she left him on the doorstep.
Hi, baby.
no, I can't. I feel like crap. Okay, come on.
I told ma that we'd meet her At the bunker hill parade, okay?
she has T. J. It's historically incorrect.
the battle of bunker hill was fought on breed's hill. Okay.
we will tell them that when we get there, okay? Come on.
the doctor cleared you to work out weeks ago. No, Maura.
Maura, Maura, Maura. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm - I'm sorry. All right. We'll take it slow. Okay.
I still think it's amazing
they can suck out an organ through a straw.
it's called a laparoscope,
and they do not use it to "suck out" your kidney.
minimally invasive," my ass. You're gonna feel much better
when you get back in shape, okay? Come on.
are you saying that I'm fat and out of shape?
no. I am saying that you have got to stop hoping
that they're gonna send you Some "thank you for your kidney" fruit basket.
giving the gift of life Is the only reward that I need, okay?
I'm very happy with my decision.
then why are you still such a whiny pain in the ass?
did you just call me a whiny pain in the ass?
no.
ever since you gave That ungrateful half-sister of yours your kidney,
you just - you just haven't been yourself.
okay?
and I'm not the only one that sees it. Just - you've been talking about me?
my best friend gossiping after what I've been through?
Ooh, it's cold! I'm gonna run.
wait. Did Sergeant Korsak say something?
or was it Angela? Is she complaining?
you know, after I bought her da hong pao tea.
Hey, T. J. you like the parade? You like the music?
what the heck is that? Nice, right? I just bought it.
want to go for a ride? No. Motorcycles are dangerous.
only if I drop it on my foot. I can't get it started.
good.
Hey, ma. Hi.
Frankie, did you get it? Did you get it?! It's not official.
Angela, if you have an issue with my mood
your mood? Well, Jane said that you were complaining about me.
I did not say that, ma. Look, sweetheart, we're worried about you.
wouldn't you be happier If you just talked to your mom and sister?
Dr. Phil, can this wait, all right? Frankie has an announcement.
I'm getting promoted to Detective. Yes!
in the drug unit. That's why I bought this.
it's my cover. Congratulations, sweetheart.
that's great. Great job.
well, at least you get to go undercover as a biker
instead of a prostitute.
it wasn't my idea. Did it cut out suddenly?
Yeah. How'd you know? Electrical.
unless - what kind of a sound did it make?
was it a cough or a wheeze?
like a
but did it also sputter?
like a ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka?
no, it was more like kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh.
Hi! Hello!
can you two please get a room - preferably a soundproof one?
carburetor. Oh.
if you get it over to my house, I'll help you fix it. That'd be great. Thanks.
well, unless you have a problem with my mood, too.
Maura, let it go.
Oh, look, there's Senator Malcolm Humphrey.
well, ex-Senator. I worked on his campaign.
Oh, look, and right behind Is his beautiful daughter, Erica.
such a great story. She won his seat.
it must be nice To follow in your father's footsteps.
what? No.
I'd be a plumber, and you'd be a mob boss. Well, okay, all I'm trying to say is,
it would be lovely to have A father/daughter relationship that works.
I'm sorry, sweetheart. It's not your fault pop's a jerk.
gun!
ma, get T. J. Out of here.
Oh, my God! Senator!
get E. M.S. Here! Get all these people out of here now!
Frankie! This way.
give me the gun.
no. Move.
clear. Clear.
a decent deer hunter could have made that shot.
it's no more than 70 yards. Should we try to find him?
we don't know who we're looking for.
but I don't think we're looking for a professional. What makes you say that?
he puked after he shot her.
I wonder what that blue stuff is.
get CSRU in here and have them collect it. Get DNA from vomit?
not usually.
process it anyway.
dad! Let me through! Let me through!
Jennifer! That's my sister! Let her through!
Oh, dad! I heard screaming!
Oh, my God! Do you want someone to take your baby?
it's Erica's baby.
it's okay, Liam. It's okay, baby.
Jennifer, she's gone. Erica's gone.
Oh, my God!
get the bullet out yet?
what are you doing? Biting on a pencil.
Yes, I can see that. But why?
it activates the muscles used for smiling.
well, those muscles are a little out of shape.
I'm going to ignore you and attempt to improve my mood.
okay.
so... Biting pencils works?
well, holding your teeth in this position
engages the zygomaticus major and the risorius muscle.
I can't understand you. Some studies show that you can trick your brain
into thinking you're happy by moving certain muscles.
it's petty. Small-minded.
should be enough to know that I saved someone's life.
Maura, if mother Teresa gave her kidney
to a half-sister she barely knew, Even she would expect a call from her mother
saying, I don't know, "thanks for the organ.
I told hope not to contact me, And I never want Cailin to know I'm her donor.
great way to spend a Sunday. All right, I'll talk to you later.
news crews outside? It's a gang bang out there.
Sawing-type wound with jagged edges. Two punctures.
it was approximately 2. 9 centimeters.
Maura, I'm pretty confident She didn't die from tetanus.
no, she did not, and you know how I know that?
because you were there when she was shot?
cause this wound looks about five days old.
you think that's from barbed wire? Looks like that to me.
okay, Maura, um... I don't want to rush you
or tell you how to do your job, But maybe you could dig out the bullet first
so we could get started on ballistics?
I think there might be something trapped in the wound.
well, there's definitely a bullet trapped in the skull.
it'd be good to look at that bullet. It sure would.
excuse me a minute.
Oh, boy. You think the old Maura's ever coming back?
man, I hope so.
husband wasn't at the parade. What do we know about him?
he's a former environmental lawyer, like Erica was.
they were married for 10 years. Two kids.
a six-year-old and the toddler We saw with the sister at the parade.
the sister was her chief of staff.
maybe a radical political organization, An opponent, a whack job.
it seems to me there's a lot easier ways To kill a State Senator.
no, I was thinking the same thing.
small staff, no bodyguards.
what did she make, like 60k a year?
$61, 132. 99.
okay, I came upstairs to tell you That the bullet fragmented when it hit the skull.
how big are the pieces? Basically shavings.
damn. We'll have a hell of a time tracing that.
Susie's running the body through x-ray To make sure I didn't miss any pieces.
that's not cool.
okay, that's mean.
how come I don't have one of those chicks in my household?
Jane, um... Can I talk to you?
Yeah, sure. I'll call you later.
or... Uh...
Maura, have you seen the new break room? It's the old break room.
they just took all the old stuff
thanks for taking the bullet out.
you have your own refrigerator. Impressive.
okay, what did you want to talk to me about?
could you ever be married to a caretaker?
and this is a pressing question because...
Oh, I was just thinking about you and Casey.
well, stop. I haven't heard from that guy in three months.
Plus, I don't really think he's the househusband type.
probably just fell in love with his nurse Or physical therapist.
very common.
I know what you're doing. I don't know what you're talking about.
misery loves company.
I hate seeing you so sad, And whatever you're feeling,
it's okay to feel it, all right? Just say it.
okay.
I did want a fruit basket. Yes.
I did, and it should have had D'Anjou pears
and - and - and a nice prosecco
and gourmet chocolates and spa stuff.
so pick up the phone and tell her.
I can't.
Maura, okay, look.
it is okay for you to want a relationship with your mom.
you'd be even weirder than you are
if you didn't want to know your biological mother.
okay, so, now I am a whiny, weird pain in the ass.
I'm trying to be patient.
that must be very hard for you. It is!
well, I'd at least like to know If Cailin is taking care of my kidney.
well, so, what? You want to spy on your kidney?
there you are. This is nice.
what is it, Susie? I thought you'd like to know that I was analyzing
the stomach contents from the victim, And I noticed blueberries in it.
blueberries? I found blue chunks in vomit at the scene.
Yeah, I know that. I was analyzing that, too.
did you compare both the samples? Yes.
so, Erica and her killer Both had the same batch of blueberry waffles
two hours before Erica was shot.
wow, that is a huge break If we can figure out who she ate breakfast with.
I say it's the husband. He's got motive.
which is? He's fed up with being a househusband.
he was a big lawyer when they met. She worked for him.
well, we could rule out her staffers,
and her opponent's right there.
thank you so much.
I love Massachusetts, and I love your big hearts.
and we're live As slain Senator Erica Humphrey-Miller's husband, Jeff Miller,
enters the State house just hours after the shooting.
first thing he does is go to his wife's office? He killed her to take her seat?
let's go talk to him. Take Frost. I want to go look at the bullet fragments.
governor just called. And you know how much I hate it when the Governor calls.
not only was our victim a State Senator, Her father has friends in high places,
so let's get this shooter as fast as we can.
Yes, sir.
I'll meet you downstairs.
okay.
I heard your mother was at the parade with T. J.
how's she doing? Why don't you call her?
I mean, I'm sure she'd love to hear from you. Well, I don't want to bother her.
she just watched a woman get gunned down.
she's already pretty bothered.
well, tell her - give her my best.
no matter what, my wife's work will continue.
she was committed to all of you And to the people of Massachusetts.
Yeah, sounds like he's running for office.
you were there. Yes. I'm Detective Jane Rizzoli.
this is Detective Barry Frost. We're very sorry for your loss.
thank you.
I'll do whatever I can To find the people who murdered my wife.
did she have any enemies? Anyone she was afraid of?
Erica was pushing to pass new environmental legislation.
the bad guys didn't like that. You think that got her killed?
Yes. I think it was a fringe group.
she'd always gotten nasty letters, but...
this felt organized.
did you call the police? She didn't want to.
did she have a breakfast meeting scheduled for this morning?
no.
you sure? She left the house at 7: 00. Well, she didn't get to the parade until 8: 30.
where was she for 90 minutes? No idea.
I handled her schedule.
all she had today was the parade. What does "THT" stand for?
it's right here on Tuesday, June 11th.
I don't know. Her calendar was packed last week.
it's wide open this coming week.
deliver GBS tomorrow. " what does that mean?
I don't know. Erica put it in the calendar.
why weren't you at the parade? One of us had to take our six-year-old
to his soccer game. Our children were very important to us.
we didn't want them to have the childhood Erica had. We were campaign kids.
we spent every spare minute with my dad.
we got to do sports, though.
she was a great skier.
um... I'm sorry.
we're gonna need to collect her computer.
it's in her office.
uh, excuse me, Mr. Miller.
uh, where was your son's soccer game? Breed's park.
that's not far from the parade. What's that supposed to mean?
I didn't shoot my wife. We found some evidence at the scene.
well, check with the other parents. They'll confirm my alibi.
I intend to, And I'm sorry to ask, but I'd like to do a cheek swab.
I'm also an attorney, Detective.
you need to show some probable cause, And since you don't have any,
I'm going home to my motherless children.
I really hope he didn't kill her.
What'd you find? I got her computer.
uh, what do you make of this?
I found four of these under the Senator's desk.
dirty water?
her sister doesn't know why she was keeping them. I don't know.
we'll take it to the lab and have them analyzed.
it's Maura, and she's out front.
I have no idea why. I got this. I'll meet you back at the ranch.
okay, thanks.
do you see her?
no.
her Facebook page said she'd be here. Is that her?
is that a triple shot with three pumps of caramel?
well, it's better than three shots of tequila.
that is not a very respectful way To treat someone else's kidney.
Oh, God! Get down! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Slouch!
Oh, did she see us? Did she see us?
I don't know, Maura. The window's over there.
what are you doing? I'm reading an e-mail from Susie.
Really? Wait. I can listen to it.
her Facebook page
says Cailin has checked in at the college caf? Well, thanks for the tip.
this is awkward.
well, you are spying on her. I am spying on my kidney.
that is very different. Okay.
go talk to her.
no. Go!
and please hurry. We have a lot of work to do.
I feel very silly. You're gonna feel even sillier When I push you out with my feet.
Cailin, wait. Let me - let me explain.
no. You don't have to.
I've owed you an apology for a long time.
I'm really sorry about everything that I said And all the crap that I pulled.
I really appreciate you saying that.
I can't ever really thank you enough.
for what?
come on, Maura. I'm premed.
I knew it was your kidney, But you confirmed it when you got out of the car.
does it still hurt?
not too bad.
thank you for checking up on me.
that is what you were doing, right?
I was gonna send this.
it belongs to you. To me?
you'll understand once you open it.
I wrote you a letter, too.
text me. Um...
Yes. Yes, I'd like that.
okay. Cool.
all right. Um... Bye.
Bye.
so...
she gave me this.
Wow. Scrimshaw. It's really pretty.
I think that's real whalebone. It's a family heirloom.
hope gave it to Cailin on her 18th birthday.
well, that was sweet of her to give it to you.
or not.
it was a gift to hope on her 18th birthday.
who gave it to her?
a man who's about to go on trial for 15 murders.
my father, Paddy Doyle.
okay, so, this website, "stop bad people,
looks like the same organization That sent this to Erica's office.
I checked Erica's credit cards. She didn't use them today.
the only calls she made were to her husband and her sister.
what about the bullet fragments? No, it's a dead end.
no way we'll get enough ballistics to even run it.
but based on weight, it's a. 22. Well, that's something.
Yeah!
I am the man. "stop bad people" has a Boston address.
437 Claremont street. Check this out.
they're anti-women, anti-environment, anti-aura?
who's anti-aura? Oh, well, look at this.
whoever administers that hate site Is a registered gun owner.
Hey, king of the world, if you're not too busy.
any DNA yet? No. I'm sorry, Detective.
damn. Have you seen dr. Isles?
a gravity inverter.
and we're inverting because...
I'd rather not say. Okay.
but if you think it's because of that necklace - What, this?
why would a necklace that your mob-boss father
gave your pregnant teenage mom upset you so much
that you're hanging upside down like a bat?
well, inverting equalizes cerebral fluid And eases the strain on the vertebrae.
you're worried about Paddy's trial, aren't you?
I was so wrapped up in recovering from surgery
that I didn't have time to think about him, too.
it's very overwhelming. What do I do?
I think you know what you should do.
reach out to hope. I'm sure she's dying to talk to you.
no.
I'm fine.
not with this in your mouth. Come on. Come on.
we have a murder to solve. And I need your help.
take him on down to the interrogation room, Tony.
w- is that the "stop bad people" guy?
come on. You'll get a kick out of this guy.
you're a Detective? Yeah.
Hey, Ismail, stop drooling over Detective Rizzoli
and talk to me about this gun. You pulled the guts out.
Yeah, the - the plastic ones that come with the game suck.
he used this for video games?
Uh-huh. Yeah. A- are you a fan?
do you - do you like - do you play video games?
Oh, yeah.
how about if you tell us a little bit About your operation?
um, I-I don't know what you're
what - what you're... Talk- talk- talking about.
cyber bullying is a federal crime, Ismail. A federal crime.
okay, the service I provide isn't bullying.
it's legal harassment. Okay.
you want to tell us why you were legally harassing Senator Erica Humphrey-Miller?
what?
Oh, that - that - you don't
I didn't have any personal animosity towards her
or any of the people my customers hire me to harass.
so that's your business?
you build hate websites and send hate mail?
well, I - I wouldn't describe it quite like that.
who hired you to harass the Senator? I don't know.
I swear. I don't. It's part of my business model.
I use a pay service That assures anonymity for all my clients.
we've seized all his computers.
okay. Let's go see if you are telling the truth.
why - why would I lie?
I'm a businessman, not an assassin.
it was - it was - It was really nice to meet you, Detective.
we should do something sometime or
Hey, should I - should I wait here?
Yes, why don't you?
sass!
he's telling the truth about the pay service.
it's a pretty complex money transaction. I'm not sure I can track where the funds come from.
I'll tell them to let him go.
Hey, release that kid, Ismail. Thanks.
so, all we know Is someone orchestrated a nasty campaign
against the victim. I'm telling you, the husband had time.
soccer parents only remember seeing him At the beginning and the end of the game.
that's not enough to arrest him.
we need something that shows they had breakfast together.
Yeah, the blueberry waffles are the key here.
if she really left her house at 7: 00,
she had 90 minutes Before she was first seen at the parade.
so, where'd she go? Well, she couldn't have driven
more than, say, 20 miles each way.
so...
we look...
20 miles in every direction.
that's a lot of area to cover. 1, 256. 6 square miles.
area... Equals pi "r" squared.
I thought he got promoted. Not yet.
glad you're not my sister. Do you want to do it?
no.
DNA?
no. Results on the water From the bottles you found under the victim's desk.
it's well water mixed with soil.
that's it? There's no contaminates? Nope.
Erica's hard drive had the results
of groundwater and soil studies She'd had commissioned over the last six months.
why in Reedville? I don't know. But everything was normal.
didn't seem worth mentioning. Is there any way to see if the water in those bottles
came from Reedville, too? I'll have the crime lab look into it.
what'll that tell us? I don't know. Just following a hunch.
what? You're not tired? I'm fine. I'm just sick of you yawning.
I've got to call it a night. My dog walker called in sick.
and what's your excuse?
slave driver didn't show up to race the dog team?
cats having a fashion show? Hamsters made you dinner?
Yeah. All of the above.
good night. Hey, Jane, let's run.
it's not too far to your apartment. Now you want to run?
come on. I finally feel like it. The things I do for you.
who is that? I don't know.
what are you doing? I don't know what I did with my pepper spray.
I knew I should have brought my gun.
Oh, my God. It's Casey.
he looks very good. I hope all of his parts are working. Oh, Maura.
Hey, there. Hi.
I called the station. They, uh, they said you were on your way home.
what are you doing here? You look great.
well, I feel pretty good. Wow, I mean, you've recovered most of your mobility.
are you wearing thermoplastic braces?
you've got good eyes.
Yeah.
I mean, how is that possible? You had cauda equina.
it isn't treatable. Well, I'm still trying to believe it myself.
I got lucky. I was, uh, I was misdiagnosed thanks to a bad MRI.
but you still had neurosurgery. Oh, yeah.
they opened me up, And they found shrapnel pressing against my spinal cord.
took it out. That's incredible.
it really is. And what about sexual function?
Dr. Isles, this is actually not one of your patients.
sorry. Sorry.
I'm gonna go finish my run. I'll see you tomorrow.
no, Maura, come on. I'll take you home. It's...
so happy this isn't awkward.
I have to walk Jo Friday.
I mean, do you want to
Yeah. I'd really like that.
okay.
I never know how long You're supposed to let a dog sniff.
you're not. She's marking territory.
look sharp!
Cesar, the dog whisperer. He uses that expression.
it's from the north of England. It means be quick and do your business.
she only did that because you're a soldier And you have a hint of an accent.
I don't have an accent. Yes, you do.
it was worse when we were in high school, But I can still hear the north of England in you.
that's something I love about you
that you've known me for so long.
it was my massive crush began on you when I was 15.
I wrote about 100 e-mails to you in the hospital, More when I was recovering.
I never got them. I didn't send any of them.
it wasn't just the physical injuries that stopped me.
it was, uh... It was PTSD.
I know a little about post-traumatic stress disorder.
someday, if - if you want to hear it, I'll tell you what happened.
right now, I'm just so happy to see you.
I see the neurosurgeon fixed that, too.
he did.
God, you're beautiful. You're beautiful.
I'm thinking something, Jane.
what? No, no, no. No thinking. No thinking.
Yeah.
I'm thinking that...
I want us to be in love before we do this. I can't just show up
Ugh. God, you're good. What's that supposed to mean?
well, you just said the best line To get a woman to take her clothes off.
I did? yes.
you know you did.
you don't leave a chef an awful lot to work with.
jar of pickles and marmite that expired five years ago.
wait. Put that back. Maura gave that to me.
I might use it to kill her someday.
good morning. Morning.
somebody needs to take care of you.
I should have told you this last night.
no, if this is about your STDS or your ex-wives or
just please save it for after breakfast.
I'm going back to Afghanistan.
just for a few months.
I've been asked to go with a team of psychologists.
I'm getting training in virtual therapy for combat soldiers.
is that what helped you? Virtual therapy?
then I understand.
I knew you would.
when I get back, I think it's time you and I give it a shot.
me too. Go all domestic together.
Yes, but there has to be rules Before you throw out my marmite.
I'll get you another jar,
and I'll also teach you to get Jo Friday to look sharp.
maybe.
only if you keep the accent.
I... Don't have an accent.
Yes, you do.
you do have an accent.
Hello? Help.
you're supposed to set it for your height. I was thinking about the case.
I think you were thinking about the Case-y.
well, I came to see you, But someone was taking their sweet time
in coming to work.
well, that's 'cause you wouldn't stop talking When I was trying to get dressed.
you call me.
he'll be back, Jane. You said he'd be at the Bagram Air Base.
Yeah, but he still has to go to Kandahar. By plane.
he said no road travel.
you know, when he told me, I was so sad and terrified.
but I was also...
Oh, my God. It can't be.
what? Tell me. I was relieved.
is that all? What do you mean, is that all?
you've been pining over this man for a year now.
it's simply fear talking.
you're afraid that if you allow yourself to get involved,
you'll get hurt, So you're looking for reasons to withdraw.
I am not.
he moved the cereal boxes.
and he threw out my shredded wheat. You've had that box for five years.
I just opened it.
I mean, what if this is the gateway
to mom jeans and baby slime
and - and arguments over the remote control
and clipping coupons and buying in bulk?
okay, go back to telling me about the part When he had you pinned against the building.
Oh, yeah.
some of the results are in
on the particulate found in Erica's scratch. Disturbed soil.
disturbed soil?
that just means it's from an old industrial area. Looks like Readville.
Readville. Again.
and again. The second round of water results are back, too,
and the water in the bottles from Erica's office Was also from Readville.
Hey. What do you got? I cannot wait until 5: 00 on Friday,
when my promotion becomes official
and I don't have to be your personal patrol-officer slave.
just tell me if you found a diner That serves blueberry waffles in Readville, please.
why didn't you tell me it was in Readville? Do you know how many places I called?
394, Jane.
I didn't know we were looking in Readville, Frankie. That's what you do when you're a Detective.
you detect. All right.
thank you.
Hey, Maura. Morning, Frankie.
Jane, the yellow pollen in her scratch
is from the lonicera hirsuta,
also called the hairy honeysuckle flower.
does the horny honeysuckle grow in Readville?
hairy. No. It only grows in the berkshires.
then you can tell me about the hairy horny flower later. Let's go get blueberry waffles.
Oh, I already ate. No - I did, too, but you're coming with me.
no, I'm not. Yes, you are. I might need you to take some water samples, okay?
come on. The key to this is Readville.
good morning.
Hi. Do you have blueberry waffles? Oh, we just ran out.
but the corned beef hash is really good.
that's our victim. What are we gonna do now?
senator Erica was the only one who'd listen. See that little boy?
he's so sick now he can barely hold up his head.
cancer.
and that little girl and that one, too.
something is poisoning us all here.
I'm sorry.
let me get you two a table.
thank you. Mm-hmm.
okay, that's why Erica was doing soil and water testing Here in Readville.
nonspecific symptoms and unrelated illnesses
don't necessarily mean That environmental toxins are getting in the water supply.
you know, don't ever eat in hospital cafeterias.
Oh, and avoid anybody in scrubs. Anything else?
why do you have to be like that? Like what?
like every time you have a random thought, I got to get into your random-thought caravan.
well, hospital uniforms are teeming with bacteria.
I'm giving you a tip to be healthy. Maura, that's it.
what's it? Oh, now I'm supposed to get in your caravan.
they're factory workers. Look at the logos - that horny flower.
hairy. What makes it distinctive is the fuzzy leaves.
wait. Let me see your tablet.
hairy honeysuckle battery company.
you said this only grows in the berkshires. It does. It's endangered.
looks like they transplanted it.
the vines are growing on the barbed wire.
you found that same pollen in soil in Erica's scratch. We'll see...
she must have snuck in the factory. What was she looking for?
well, they recycle lead-acid, nickel cadmium,
nickel metal hydride batteries. How toxic is all that?
newer batteries are reasonably clean,
but older batteries, they release lead and cadmium.
could the workers carry that out on their uniforms?
Yes, it's known as take-home toxins.
thts - take-home toxins.
Erica had written that down in her calendar.
these men are probably covered in toxins.
and Erica figured that out, and whoever killed her
didn't want her making that public.
bill Davenport owns the factory.
problem is, he was in San Francisco yesterday.
so, unless he hired someone, he's not our shooter. Look at this, Jane.
Erica Humphrey-Miller wrote up a grant proposal.
to the department of energy? Why?
it looks like the grant money was supposed to fund
environmentally friendly practices. Hairy honeysuckle got 2 million bucks.
why am I paying taxes? So they can give them to Bill Davenport?
does he look like he needs the money?
well, it's used to pay for safeguards Like showers and air regulators,
in addition to disposable uniforms.
which they weren't using.
what if they took the government handout And then paid off an inspector to look the other way?
OSHA doesn't monitor take-home toxins With inspectors yet.
they rely on outside regulators. Frost, scroll to the end of that document.
look who was in charge of compliance.
you said you didn't know what THT meant.
I don't. -Then I'll decode that for you. It means "take-home toxins.
where are we going with this? You said you had a development in the case.
we do.
these are straps for a. 22 caliber rifle, Aren't they, Jennifer?
Erica and Jennifer were both biathletes.
what does this have to do with my daughter's murder?
senator, you need to hear this.
doesn't say you failed the bar three times.
no husband, no children.
Erica threw you a bone making you chief of staff.
detective Frost, please tell us what you found.
the person who paid "stop bad people
to harass Erica used a pay service That hides their customers' identities
by sending the money through a Boston bank, A Nashville bank, and, finally, a bank in London.
those documents there trace a transaction
right back to your office computer.
what? -What the hell is going on here?
I think Jennifer knows.
that's pretty cold, Jennifer. We found gun oil inside the baby's backpack...
and what's left of a blueberry waffle.
three months ago, Erica started testing The water and the soil in Readville
because the children were so sick, But the water was fine, the soil was fine,
so it didn't make any sense...
unless the toxins were coming From the only new thing in town
the honeysuckle battery factory. Oh, no, no, no, no. That's not possible.
Erica got them a $2 million grant to prevent that.
I bet it was hard for Erica to believe That her little sister would take a bribe
and let children die.
deliver GBS.
tell your father, Jennifer. What did that mean?
it meant...
deliver goodbye speech.
Oh, my God.
Erica was gonna resign and expose you,
and I'll bet she was even gonna take the responsibility
and clean up the environmental mess that you made. I want a lawyer.
I bet you do.
I'm sorry, Senator.
at least her children won't be orphans.
even more reason to marry a househusband. I'm glad I don't have a sister.
well, Cailin's not gonna shoot me.
you know, that motorcycle would make a beautiful caf? racer.
come on. He's in the drug unit, not the espresso unit.
the Harley look is pass?
1960s British rockers are back.
actually, caf? racer could be a better cover
for busting dealers selling in clubs and colleges.
I'm in. Can you get it running?
well, the intake vacuum pressure pulls the fuel through
and mixes liquid with air
before it sucks it into the combustion chamber.
Mm. Go on.
violent explosion rams the big piston down
with great force.
long connecting rod forces the crank pin into rotation,
which is what you want.
God, I would love to have my crank pin rotated
right about now. I knew you'd miss him. Mm.
okay, you guys are making me really uncomfortable.
Oh, stop it, you big lug. You would not have done
I didn't know you were here.
hello. Hi, Lieutenant.
we were just gonna make dinner together.
I hope you two don't mind. No.
no. How nice.
night.
night"? What the hell?
Shh! They can hear you! I hope they can hear me!
they shouldn't be doing Whatever it is they're planning to do.
Frankie, go in there.
me? I'm not going in there. You go in there.
no. hope you don't mind,
I'm gonna toss your mother around a bit, all right?
Yeah, you know what? I mind!
we are minding! Toss? Them? I can't. No.
got something for me? - Right here.
everything cool? - Yeah.
Hey, there.
you got a second?
tell me! - It's just me, I swear!
no one else knows ... I swear!
didn't you just detail it?
the only time I wash my car is right before I sell it.
it only has to be detailed again because you spilled your triple power latte, and it smells like a deco.
what's deco? - A decomposing body.
how do you know it was me? - You know, Europeans have it right.
car engineers design them without cup holders.
where do you put your coffee?
you drink it at a café, you do not slosh it around in your car.
I don't slosh, and where are you going?
to a rave with your friends Atticus and Tallulah?
no, feels more like Cafe Ace with London rockers.
can you two go inspect someone else?
that's very yellow. - Thank you.
you know, you should be very careful around ovulating women.
the University of Texas study determined that ovulating women are attracted to biker types in order to fertilize their eggs.
ha! Explains what happened with, uh, me and your father.
whoa, pop rode a motorcycle? - I'd rather not remember.
I thought if I looked the part, I might get a U. C. assignment faster.
did you hear we have a new boss at DCU?
you ever meet him, Jane? Lieutenant ... - Rafael Martinez.
it's been a long time, Rizzoli.
Rafi, when did you crawl out from under the covers?
I don't think we ever met, sir. - So, you're the other Rizzoli.
Yeah, yeah, I guess so, sir.
okay, other Rizzoli. My office in 10.
sure.
did you two ... - Maura, not now.
Oh, I cannot get a break. - Frankie, come on!
what did you two do?
I have to get this. Don't you?
Dr. Isles. - Jane!
Yeah, we'll be right there.
Jane! - Bye, Ma.
well, thanks to you, I don't have a change of clothes in my car ...
it's getting ... detailed.
how many times do you want me to apologize?
here. You can borrow these.
fine. Ruin your $200 Zambonis.
Zanottis. These are Giuseppe Zanottis. They're $550.
550 bucks! I Hope they gave you the rest of the cow.
you know, for that, they should give you the whole herd.
mother... phooey.
morning, Sergeant. - Morning.
so, Martinez is back, huh? - It'll be fine.
Oh, no, it's wicking. - Oh, no. What's wicking?
it's being absorbed into the leather.
well, that wouldn't have happened if you were wearing these.
we got a good, old jurisdictional turf war with the staties.
tide is going out. Body'll be on the sand in 15 minutes.
we'll have to work this case with the state police.
that is bullshit.
why do they get jurisdiction over the beaches?
all right, we got to get her to float back into BPD territory.
we can't move the body now, Jane.
Hey, Rizzoli! Since we got this, you mind grabbing us some coffee?
Oh, yeah, sure, right after I solve this homicide, okay?
I can't stand Bob Thatcher. - Yeah, officious and competitive.
want to help me twist off his balding head?
can we make it look like a suicide?
I never liked him, either. The body is almost on the beach.
I guess I'm gonna be working this with the state police.
Oh, my gosh, look, Maura! There's a ... there's a horseshoe crab!
right there! - Where?
right there! - Yeah, yeah, I see one right there.
there haven't been any horseshoe crabs in Dorchester bay in 25 years.
they're back.
Oh, look, there's another one right there!
now, be careful. They're endangered.
what? Where? I haven't seen one since I was a little kid.
Dr. Isles, I ... I think I see an egg.
okay!
you are in a delicate mating area of the limulus polyphemus!
okay, I need crime-scene tape and barricades now! Hurry!
Oh, look at that! She's in the surf! Guess this one's ours!
Oh, that's cute, Rizzoli! That's real cute!
listen, since you're not doing anything, Can you grab me a triple power latte?!
thank you! - Korsak.
she's so young. - We didn't find any I. D. on her.
we also didn't find any horseshoe crabs.
I'm sorry. It was all I could think of.
it's pretty symmetrical gashes.
I mean, these aren't from banging into pilings.
look at this. It takes a lot of force to pull hair from the scalp right there.
somebody slammed her head into something.
you think that's what killed her?
well, froth in the nose and mouth indicates drowning, but I'll need to do a full autopsy.
you're gonna have a hell of a time pulling prints off of her.
early stage maceration.
a saline injection should restore fingerpads.
how long was she in the water? - Floaters are a unique challenge.
the ocean is a very effective medium for destroying forensics.
how did I know you'd say that? - I'll give you a window.
she was in the water for 8 to 10 hours.
given the tidal flow and the current, she was dumped from somewhere inside the harbor.
saw that from the crow's nest, did you, sailor?
I'm not even gonna dignify that with an answer, gym rat.
I know that because she's not halfway to Bermuda.
inside the harbor? That's still a big area to cover.
we got to find the crime scene where this poor girl was killed.
you're still wearing my boots. You know I want 'em back.
now? They're so comfortable.
okay, fine. You can keep 'em.
Really? - Yes.
as long as you promise to wear them with all your yellow outfits.
I will change out of them as soon as I get a minute.
Hey, Maura, what is this abrasion?
it's sticky.
what is Martinez doing down here?
uh, well, DCU's evidence is getting processed in-house now.
what happened with him?
can we talk about this when he's not ten feet away?
Dr. Isles.
I should have introduced myself. Rafael Martinez.
it's a little overwhelming coming back here after being gone for so long.
gone? So, you're returning to BPD?
and here I thought Detective Rizzoli had told you all about me.
it didn't even occur to me.
it's very nice of you to introduce yourself.
if you need anything, feel free to contact me or my staff.
thank you.
I finally get promoted to Detective, and my boss hates Rizzolis.
Hey, thanks, Jane.
well, maybe it's not maybe it's police work.
no, it's Rizzolis.
you slept with Rafael.
we didn't sleep, Maura. - Oh, it's nothing to be ashamed of.
rafael is very attractive. You're very attractive.
rafael wasn't your boss, was he?
can you please stop calling him Rafael? And, no, he wasn't.
rafael is his name. - In a harlequin romance.
at work, here, it's Martinez.
okay, so, other than in the biblical sense, how do you know Lieutenant Martinez?
we worked together when I started in the drug unit.
we had to play a couple and go to clubs and dance and blend in and drink and bust people.
I was hoping I'd never see him again.
Oh, no. Jane, was he married?
no. Actually, that would have been easier.
we got my C. I. killed.
I'm so sorry. - Yeah, and then we had a falling out, and then he took an assignment with a federal task force, and that was eight years ago, and I haven't seen him since.
Dr. Isles? Your sister's upstairs.
my sister? - That's what she said.
you do have a sister, Maura.
Oh, right. Yes, tell Cailin to wait for me in the caf?
you know, you're a little harlequin romance-y yourself.
what do you mean? - Well, in the space of two years, you found out your biological dad is a gangster who's about to star in his own R. I.C. O. trial, and mom, a renowned humanitarian, who is nice to everyone but you.
what else? Let's see. Am I forgetting something?
I gave my kidney to a half-sister I don't know.
I think I'm more of s Dickensian character.
Yeah, or a really good guest on "Jerry Springer."
come on. - Where am I going?
to offer moral support in case Cailin wants another one of my organs.
no, thanks. Unless... - Unless what?
love your wellies.
you drive a hard bargain. Cailin.
what a surprise. You shouldn't bite your nails.
it's very unsanitary and bad for your teeth.
you'll have to excuse her.
believe it or not, you make your big sister nervous.
me? Why? - Well, she wants you to like her.
25% of all young adults bite their nails.
you'll grow out of it. - See? It's nerves.
sorry. Sorry.
no, I'm ... I'm sorry to just show up here.
would you like to talk to Maura alone? - No. I'm glad you're here.
it's about my Mom. Our Mom.
you want to sit down? - Yeah.
is she all right? - I'm not sure.
some men came by the house last night. - What kind of men?
scary ones. I mean, they wore suits, but they had this, like, dark energy.
well, do you know what they wanted? - No, but they seemed pissed.
she told me to go to my room and lock my door.
lock your door? - They were talking pretty quietly, but I heard them ask her about M. E.N. D.
medical Emergency Network of Doctors.
that's Hope's charity.
well, could it have been about fundraising?
it sounded like they were threatening her.
she says we're going back to London.
well, isn't that a good idea? I thought you missed London.
I love it here now.
but... I don't know. It's too full of ghosts for her.
I ... I don't mean you.
you mean Paddy Doyle? - Yeah, I see her reading the papers.
she's following his R. I.C. O. pre-trial hearings.
I'm glad you're wearing it.
it's very sweet of you to give it to me.
I got to get back to class.
I'd really appreciate it if you'd talk to her, - find out what's going on. - Okay.
now what? - No idea.
I can't think in these boots.
come on, let me do it. - No.
let me at least run the search. - No way!
nothing in AFIS or NCIC.
who the hell is she?
you got to go to the seminar and read the manual.
it's not your personal toy. - And it's not an arcade game.
move. I want to run the training session.
stop!
stop messing around. - I'm not gonna break it.
stop it! - You're gonna break it.
whoa, hey, hi! Could you kids please share your toys?
well, he hogs the thing like he owns it.
Yeah, because one swipe from bear paws here will take out the whole system.
so, no I. D? She's still a Jane Doe?
we got to wait on dental records.
preliminary results are back on the tissue samples from her lungs.
lungs? Wasn't cause of death drowning?
Yes, but not from seawater. - Sparkling water?
no, she aspirated rainwater.
we're looking for a crime scene with a bucket full of rainwater?
well, we know the body was tossed in the ocean somewhere near the harbor.
Yeah, maybe she was killed near the harbor, too.
are there any tests you can run?
I'll have Susie run the water from the lungs through the mass spectrometer.
it is a long shot, though.
Hey, what are you doing for lunch? - Nothing. Why?
come on, Maura. You can do this. Come on.
no, I don't like to be tricked twice in one day.
I said we were having lunch. I didn't say where.
Oh, it was wise of you not to tell me what lunch was, either.
what, you don't like cold, greasy corn dogs?
you know, this used to be a methadone clinic, but thanks to Dr. Hope Martin, it's the first M. E.N. D. clinic in the U. S.
look, I do not object to her saving women and children, but I do object to her calling me a liar and then ignoring me until she needed my kidney.
you're a good person.
why do we always feel this tug when we're related by blood?
what does the research say? - Nothing that explains how I feel.
name?
detective Rizzoli! - Hi, Shandra.
girl, you are still as skinny as the day you locked me up.
how are you? You look great. - Thank you.
this woman is the reason I quit drugs and finished nursing school.
look at you. - Thank you.
sorry it's so crazy in here today.
no, that's all right. We're actually here to see Dr. Martin.
Bye-bye.
Maura. Detective Rizzoli.
is Cailin all right? - Yeah, she's fine.
she's a little concerned about you, though.
about me? Why?
where did you get that necklace? - Oh, I'm ... I'm sorry.
I-I thought you knew that Cailin gave it to me.
Oh, of course.
Shandra, could you please put Mrs. Reynolds in room two and weigh that Perez baby? Thanks.
let's go talk in my office.
teenagers can be so dramatic.
those "big, scary men ..." they're my accountants.
well, I'll talk to her. - Your accountants come at 11: 00 at night?
well, I am too busy during the day.
she's afraid for you, Hope. - And that's silly.
and although I'm very sorry that she put you through this,
I really am glad to see you, Maura.
I don't want to pry into your life.
I just feel a responsibility to Cailin. I told her I would talk to you.
and I so appreciate it, but, really, it's just M. E.N. D. business.
is that why you told Cailin to lock the door?
and why are you moving back to London? Is someone threatening you, Hope?
sorry, Doctor. We're getting a little behind.
I will be right there. I'm sorry, but I have to get back to work.
how can you go back to London with all these people depending on you?
every clinic that I open has to run without me eventually.
and I do have to think about Cailin.
she wants to move back to London. Thank you.
too bad line that give her hives.
maybe she has bad lying a reason, Jane.
what ... the truth gives her eczema?
you don't like her, do you? - No, I don't like the way she treats you.
Cailin's an adult. Have a relationship with her.
you know, you don't have to have contact with Hope.
and, by the way, what does Constance say about all this?
she raised me. She's my mother. I don't talk about it with her.
Hey, Frost. What's up?
got something, although bear paws might take the rest of his life pulling it up.
you know, some research indicates that a wide hand with stubby fingers correlates with high intelligence.
see that, smart ass? - Okay. Got our victim.
Brenda Thomas, 20. She was a BCU student.
and a Psi Beta Tau.
same type as in my day. Betas were smart, foxy.
you didn't go to college, Korsak. - I went to a lot of toga parties.
I wouldn't use that. Expired lipstick grows bacteria.
is it pinkish red in a black tube? - Yes.
she's had that since I got promoted.
ignore him, Jane. Victim's parents live in Dedham.
we'll make the notification, then hit the sorority house.
all right, I'll meet you back at BPD.
what's wrong? - I forgot to get my dry cleaning, so I'm gonna drop you off and pick it up.
okay.
you said this was about my daughter, so get to it.
call your boys off Maura. - What the hell you talking about?
the thugs you got following Maura. Call them off, Paddy.
is she okay? Is Maura all right?
Yeah, she's fine. Why are your guys following her?
are these the same guys that you sicced on Hope?
did you get a look at 'em?
they're not your guys, are they?
I don't think you need me to answer that one for you, Rizzoli.
why are the feds after Hope? Why are they surveilling Maura?
I'm done here. - No, wait a minute!
why are they surveilling Maura?
Thanks, Gabriel. I really appreciate it.
that was awkward. - Thank you for calling Agent Dean.
I know that was hard. What did he say?
he said he really shouldn't be talking to me, but here's what he knows.
the organized crime division of the FBI is investigating M. E.N. D. and Hope.
Oh, my god. For what? - He said he didn't know.
but think about it, Maura. it's got to be connected to Paddy.
and you should have seen Paddy's face. He knows why.
okay. She started M. E.N. D. in 1993. That's 20 years ago.
which means they were in contact after I was born.
maybe even when he was a fugitive.
they're following you, too. - The feds?
Yeah, I saw them today. - Why?
I don't have anything to do with M. E.N. D. or with Paddy.
what do I do? - Nothing.
I mean, there's nothing you can do once they're surveilling you.
all right, I got to go talk to the victim's roommates.
go. Go, it's okay.
you seeing anything? - Just a bunch of girly stuff.
I think I just found some study aids.
"BCU gold dust." Looks like cocaine.
Jane's stuck on memorial drive. - We have to get DCU involved.
what's the deal between Jane and Martinez?
it is a long story.
Rachel? Come in here, please, would you?
did Brenda snort a lot of cocaine?
no way. She was so against drugs.
she didn't even drink.
she told me that her brother died from an O. D.
help your friend out, Rachel.
we need to know what Brenda was into. - School.
how about the rest of you? You recognize this?
I don't know why she had that, but she was not using it.
did she have a boyfriend? - No.
she studied so much, she'd fall asleep in the library.
that's why we weren't worried when she didn't come home.
what was she studying?
Brenda wanted to be an investigative journalist.
like Woodward and Bernstein?
no, like Christiane Amanpour.
she got an "A" on this investigative report.
Yeah, she got an "A" on everything.
who is T. F? - Her adviser, Tyrell Feeney.
Brenda called him "Touchy Feeney."
maybe touchy Feeney did more than just touch.
looks like Brenda didn't want her sorority sisters in her computer.
she password-protected everything and stored it in the cloud.
there's no way I'll get in without a password.
did you try "password"?
password? - Yeah. It's the most common password.
what do we know about Mr. Touchy Feeney?
well, he was a part-time adjunct professor at BCU, wrote about crime for the "Boston dispatch."
okay, this is interesting.
he owns a boat. - Does he?
I wonder if he took Brenda for a ride.
nice boat.
we found it when we were doing a little digging into a dead girl's relationships.
Brenda and I didn't have a relationship.
she was an exceptional student. That's all.
how so? - She was truly gifted.
she could write, and she could get anybody to talk to her.
when she thought she had a story, you couldn't shake her loose.
what was she working on?
I had all my students working on investigative pieces for the "Boston dispatch" college contest.
what was she investigating? - I don't know.
you were her adviser. - I made an exception.
maybe I shouldn't have, but, like any good journalist,
Brenda was protecting her sources.
well, maybe she just didn't want any contact with you, Tyrell.
you are a hugger.
that was me just being friendly and encouraging.
you hug all your students? - She was 21.
even if I did hug her, which I didn't, it isn't a crime.
not unless you killed her. - I did not kill her.
where were you last night?
out with my wife. She can verify that.
next time you guys would like to talk to me, call my lawyer.
Frankie. Oh, come on, Frankie.
what? - You look terrible.
Thanks.
what can I do? - Fix it.
whatever happened between you and Martinez, undo it.
well, you know what, Frankie? It's not that easy, all right?
I'll just suck it up while Martinez shuts me out of any real drug work.
DCU's working my homicide, okay? I'll get you on it.
Oh, fun! Maybe you'll let me answer your phones.
you know what, Frankie? - Hey!
other Rizzoli. Been looking for you. Come on.
wait, Frankie, come...
you and Martinez should've worked this out eight years ago.
Vince, come on. This is my business, all right?
but we're all caught up in the middle of it, Jane.
clean it up.
Oh, good, Jane. I've got something.
I may be able to narrow down the location of the crime scene.
that's great news. How?
well, the water in Brenda's lungs showed low levels of salinity plus CO2.
as bicarbonate anion, fish scales, and rust.
what kind of rust? - Heavy-gauge tin.
saline, fish scales, and rusty tin.
that all says one of the old warehouses near the harbor to me.
Yeah, me, too.
what's bicarbonated anion? - Rainwater.
Hey, Frost, can you check the Seaport district?
see how many abandoned warehouses are down there?
you don't know how to use that.
Oh, yeah? I read the whole manual.
there are only seven processing plants still standing.
let's go check 'em out.
this is number four.
well, look at that.
looks like we found our bucket of rainwater.
water from the roof is leaking right into it.
I'll compare the water in here to the water from her lungs.
that's blood, and that's hair.
get CSRU here, have 'em process everything.
the water is a match. - Okay, this is our crime scene.
found a wireless mike. It's greasy.
looks like someone crushed it with his heel.
maybe she was wearing a microphone. - That explains the adhesive we found.
she had a mike taped to her chest. - These mikes are pretty cheap, but they give a near-broadcast-quality recording.
Near-broadcast quality. She wanted to be like Christiane Amanpour.
maybe she was wired for an ambush interview.
well, that'll get you killed.
Yeah, especially when you're writing about drugs.
think about it. She didn't do drugs.
she was writing an investigative piece.
what about those bindles we found? - She had 'em arranged like evidence.
maybe she was cataloging them for the story?
I've tried getting into her cloud. We need her password.
I'm telling you, try "password." - Try "BCU gold.
we're in!
crap. Almost.
the audio files are individually password protected.
try "password." - If you say that again,I don't care how big your bear paws are...
trying "BCU gold."
no.
Yes! This one's opening.
please! Please!
don't!
Hey, Korsak, you ever wish you went to college?
Yeah, sometimes. You?
I saved my acceptance letter to Boston Cambridge Uuniversity.
I don't know why. - I do.
it's damned impressive that you got in, and unbelievably selfless that you chose not to go.
I'm the daughter of a plumber. My parents would still be paying it off.
what is it? - There's something in here.
looks like you got another C. I. killed.
what the hell are you talking about?
Brenda Thomas. You recognize her?
cause we pulled her body out of the harbor.
you knew.
Cavanaugh told me after they found the cocaine in Brenda's room.
we got brought in to investigate, yes.
well, you seem pretty calm for someone who just lost a C. I.
she wasn't my C. I. - No?
then why does she have your card and your safety word?
because all your informants are expendable, right?
just one more dead one. One more dead one like Yolanda.
Brenda asked for an interview for a story about campus drugs.
I talked to her because she told me she could get me into a big operation.
we've been trying to bust the guy supplying to all the colleges in Boston.
with BCU gold? - With a lot of cocaine, yes.
so, you send this little college kid to do an undercover drug buy?
one time, Rizzoli!
do you know another way to bust drug dealers?
you use C. I.s. Nobody likes it, but that's how it is.
well, why didn't you tell me about all this?
I thought we were working together. - Are we?
I want to know everything you know about the supplier.
I got nothing.
well, you better get something because this naive kid, who didn't want anybody O. D.ing, l ike her brother, was drowned in a fish trough. And that's on you, Martinez.
we already picked up the guy from the buy Brenda made for us.
we're trying to get him to make an introduction to one of my undercovers.
one of your under... Who, Frankie?
do me a favor. Don't get my brother killed.
what the hell happened to the dirty robber?
new owners committed to locally sourced organic food.
Yeah, well, I'm committed to finding a burger and fries.
Oh, no, come on. Just try it.
come on. There's a table right there.
anything?
frost can't get into the rest of Brenda's files.
thank you.
what about you? You thinking about Hope?
Jane, are they here? - Who?
the feds. - Yes. You see that guy right there with the nose ring and a bolt through his ear?
that's their lead agent.
Yeah. No, Maura.
no? - No.
what ... now, why are you eating their plants?
fresh lavender. Try it.
smells like hand lotion.
well, they do have burgers.
this sounds good, this scrambled tofu patty.
yummy. Get it with a side of mung bean fries.
I can't stop thinking about Brenda.
me, neither.
we didn't get her killed, Maura. I did.
you're not talking about Brenda, are you?
I guess that's why I've been so mad at Martinez.
eight years ago - Are you sure you're okay? - Um, yeah.
we're gonna be right here listening the whole time.
you have any problems, just say the word "cricket."
Yeah, we use the word cricket so you won't slip up and make a mistake, all right?
you only use it if you're in trouble. - Okay.
I just so desperately wanted my own C. I. and I leaned on this sweet, screwed-up girl named Yolanda.
you good to go?
let's do it.
she wasn't ready, but I offered her up, anyway.
what are you doing? - I told you I'd be here.
you have it with you? I have the money. - Who's with you?
nobody's with me. I'm alone.
she's in trouble. - No. Wait for the safety word.
no, don't! - You wired?
cricket! Cricket! - We got to go!
BPD!
Oh, no, no. Come on.
come on, baby. Yolanda, it's me. Yolanda?
what is it? - Frost got into the other three files in Brenda's cloud.
she taped three buys from student and drug dealers.
here's the last one. Recorded the afternoon she died.
I really need something to get me through finals.
I got you covered. - You're a sweetheart.
you could sell so much BCU gold to my sisters if you'd just come to the house.
I already told you, it's too risky. I heard someone got arrested there.
so? Introduce me to your connection. I'll do it, cut you in for 40%.
I don't know. - Come on, it'll be easy.
well, she got that introduction, and whoever's running this thing killed her, so how do we find that student?
I'll get on it first thing tomorrow.
what? What is it? - Cailin.
the feds just left Hope's house.
I've got to show you something.
just when I thought I'd seen everything.
I figured out how to do it when I was 9.
my parents didn't want me watching TV, so they locked it up.
it's over here.
Ooh, Maura, you've been down here before.
God, this is so unlike you.
maybe not. I am the spawn of a mobster, after all.
well, is that why you come down here?
when Paddy got arrested, I started poking through all these files.
they go all the way back to his father. - Your grandfather.
Yes.
Maura, come on. You're not like him.
you're not like any of 'em.
well, something in these files is gonna tell us why the feds were looking at me and at Hope.
1993 ... that's the year Paddy became a fugitive.
there's not a lot here while he was on the run.
I bet the FBI has a ton.
look. She came back once a year on my birthday.
well, that's touching.
Maura, she thought you were dead.
okay, what if she wasn't coming for me? - What do you mean?
I have a hunch. - Oh, no, here we go.
Maura, I told you never to hunch. You're not made for hunching.
okay. Cailin told me that Paddy gave this to Hope on her 18th birthday.
that would have been 1976.
that's not possible because this scrimshaw commemorates something that was built in 1993.
the year Paddy disappeared? - Yes.
and the year that Hope was working as a relief doctor in a war-torn area, Sarajevo.
so, I did some research, and I looked up photos on the internet of this bridge.
and it was near a secret tunnel that was built during the siege of Sarajevo by people trying to get humanitarian aid into the city.
humanitarian aid? You think your mother helped build it?
they named it the Tunnel of Hope.
Oh, my god. - Paddy was a fugitive in 1993.
he could have easily traveled to the Balkans.
so, you think Paddy and hope met in Sarajevo?
it's worse. Hope started M. E.N. D.
thanks to a $2. 5 million donation from an anonymous donor... in 1993, Jane.
Oh, my god. That's why the feds are sniffing around.
she took his dirty money.
why am I here? - Take a look at that.
they're the financial statements from M. E.N. D.
and why are you looking at them?
I don't think we're the only ones looking.
I don't know what you mean.
who gave you the money to start M. E.N. D?
I don't know, but I will be forever grateful to him or her.
because, thanks to that money, we've been able to save thousands of women and children.
I need to know.
was it Paddy?
I have sick patients that I need to see.
you won't be able to help them if you're named as a co-conspirator.
is that why the feds are putting pressure on you?
were you laundering money for him?
I can't ... - Can't what?
I can't involve you. - I am involved!
they're following me, too. - What?
Oh, god, Maura. No.
I need to see him, and I need to talk to him.
I need to make this stop.
Maura. - Don't talk to me. Talk to her.
you told me she was dead.
you told me that our baby... was dead.
I had to ... to protect you. - Why?
my father would have killed you both.
you have another chance to protect them, Paddy.
how's that?
you're going to plead guilty. - You know I'd kill for either of you.
but I will never plead guilty.
Oh, mother... phooey.
did anything CSRU processed from the crime scene yield any prints or DNA?
I'm sorry, nothing.
Oh, wait. There was one thing, though.
the residue on the wireless mike is transmission fluid with 41-40 steel particulates.
that's a transmission grinding itself up.
Jane, I think these are metal particulates, and I am almost certain that what I stepped in was transmission fluid.
from the parking lot of the first crime scene?
Yes. Susie, run both sets of metal particulate through the SEM-EDX and analyze the fluids from the shoe and the microphone using the HPLC.
same thing when we found her body? - Yes.
CSRU usually takes photos to establish the location of the crime scene.
Yeah, Frost, are there any photos from the parking lot?
right here.
so, it's one of these cars?
wait a minute ... we can't know our killer left that fluid on the day we fished her body out of the drink.
Yeah, we can. I can even tell you which car was leaking.
Oh, that multi-touch interface is talking to you, Tom Cruise?
it's right here in the vehicle maintenance records.
for the state police.
our killer's a state trooper.
Martinez. - Hey, Vinnie, what's up?
we're on our way to arrest Brenda's killer.
Yeah, you can come with us, if you want.
Yeah. I'd like that. Where to?
we tracked the suspect on the GPS in his unmarked.
it's a cop? - Yeah, it's a state trooper.
looks like it was the college supplier Brenda was telling you about.
where is he? - BCU campus ...
probably there to collect his last payments before he splits.
you got plates? - Yeah.
no, no, I don't want campus police pulling him over.
I'm not calling campus police.
I'm calling someone to make sure he doesn't get away.
Hey! Can you move that?
Oh, I can't seem to get it to turn over.
all right, I'll help you push it out of the way. I'm in a hurry.
Frankie, get out of the way! Thatcher, it's all over!
no, you don't! No, you don't!
you stay together or I will blow his head off!
don't do it.
anything happens to my brother, I won't need this gun to kill you.
this is as much on you as it is on me.
looks like you got nowhere to go, dude.
all right, you drop the bike, and you get in my car.
lift it up! Get it up!
you're under arrest, Thatcher.
my brother's good, huh? - Yeah.
all right, just relax.
almost as good as you.
don't even. - What?
I know I've failed you
but please, lord, please help me.
I was afraid you wouldn't come back.
I got scared.
but you know what?
maybe we'll get through this.
come on. What are you doing? - I got it.
Maura, w-we should use plastic. - For a christening?
it's sparkling cider. And T. J. doesn't care.
I care. It's my first grandchild.
Tommy, you're helping us clean these.
Why? - 'Cause he's your kid.
Rondo? - Vanilla. Look at those legs!
bro!
Hey! - "Bro"?
man, I was on my way to a barbecue.
brought you something for your special day.
Hey, little man, you being good?
you got him a Rolex?
no. Got a guy, got me a good deal. Looks real, don't it?
have I just been transported to some parallel universe......
when did you two start a bromance? - Oh, we go way back.
Yeah, we met at the caf ? last week.
Tom-Tom, have fun, my man. - All right. Thanks.
Hey, make sure his baby mama don't mess with him.
he's a good daddy.
what, is there something going on between Lydia and Tommy?
Oh, Frankie! Why did you leave this mess?
Jane, it's okay. - No, it's not.
I thought you were gonna restore it for your new undercover job.
Oh, there's no point.
I'm not exclusive to the drug unit anymore.
they made me a "floating" detective. - Oh, cool.
Yeah. I get to try out everything. Look at this.
what ... BPD cuts to affect all detectives.
it won't happen.
um, everybody, we should go.
I got the baby. I got the baby!
well, this should be awkward.
because of Lydia?
no. That's the priest that Tommy ran over in the crosswalk.
well, why didn't he choose another church?
because ma said that we owed it to Father Crowley to let him baptize the... next generation of Rizzolis.
you don't think he's still mad, do you?
Oh, why would he be mad? You just broke both his legs.
Hey, I spent three years in prison. That's plenty of penance.
you didn't talk to him, did you?
uh, I meant to...
God, Tommy. You see why he got all the attention?
he needed it? - Angela: Father Crowley, thank you so much for doing this.
the parish appreciates your kind donation, Angela.
Hello, Thomas.
you do plan to raise this child in the catholic faith?
uh... sure. Why not?
it's the role of the mother and father to present the child to the church.
and who are the parents?
we are. - We are.
Oh, uh, and me.
Stuart! Everyone, this is Stuart.
m-my friends call me "Strawberry."
we are not your "friends." - Tommy.
Mr. Strawberry, we are in the middle of a service.
what is this guy doing at my son's christening?
I invited him. He has every right to be here.
what are you doing? - Something smells.
Yeah, it's probably T. J.'s diaper. Stop.
no, I-I'm smelling something else. - Yeah, somethin' does stink.
Tommy, we're in a church.
tell her. She's the one who brought her lover.
he's my fianc?
what?
your what?
you cannot go up there.
okay. Father, if you would just baptize this ... this little guy, we'll ...
we'll get out of your hair. - No. Not with this guy here.
place the infant over the baptismal font.
what name do you wish to give your child?
there are human remains in there.
Strawbridge. - Strawbridge? Over my dead body.
you sure? - Well, I can't be sure unless I take a look, but...
in the name of the Father and the Son - and the Holy Spirit, I ... - What a lovely service.
thank you so much. We have to go.
come on. - Okay, Jane, we didn't even ...
ma, that's a wrap.
Frankie, can you help me get everybody out of here, please?
okay, everybody, come on. Let's go.
I knew T. J. should've been a methodist.
I should've picked a better mom for him.
you didn't "pick" me. We got drunk and did it in my car, and then you on passed me on to your father. Remember?
is that why I no longer see Frank Sr. at mass?
is there any way that we could just tell our little family stories outside, please?
I'm so sorry, Father. We're usually not like this.
okay, take it slow. It's heavy.
let's get it over here.
in the baptismal font? Is nothing sacred?
it appears to be a young female.
she looks like old shoe leather.
okay, Frost, go talk to Father Crowley. Ask him when the last time - the water in the basin was changed. - Yeah, okay.
any idea what that white powder is?
it has the odor and texture of agricultural lime.
ag-lime. I use that in my garden.
you garden? I didn't know that, Sergeant.
what do you grow?
well, let's see, I got tomatoes, basil, kitchen herbs.
I think I'll have a really good crop of green beans this year.
Oh, you know, I had great luck with french beans.
okay, farmers. Let's work on the almanac later. All right?
why would someone put ag-lime on her?
it accelerates desiccation and masks the odor.
huh. How was she killed? - There are ligature marks.
so she was strangled. - Well, I didn't say that.
I did. Well, how long has she been dead?
it was poured on her within an hour of her death.
okay. That helps.
says to me that she was killed in the church.
it doesn't say that to me.
well, a murderer isn't going to strangle her and then drag her all the way in here, dump her in there, then run all the way back out and get the ag-lime.
bet we'll find ag-lime on the grounds.
what did Father Crowley say? - He said...
Tommy Rizzoli has always been trouble.
did he say when the church was locked?
between midnight and 4: 00 A. M.
who has keys? - Staff, janitors, gardeners, choir, and anybody who uses the meeting rooms.
and 500 other parishioners. There's an awful lot of suspects.
if we have this ag-lime anywhere, - it would be in our shed. - Thank you.
father Crowley: Mateo. - Good morning, Father.
hope you like petunias. We're replanting the flower beds.
Yes, of course. Hello, Samuel.
samuel: Hello, Father. - Back from Britmore so soon?
actually, we're just back on break. - Britmore. That's a really good college.
he's a hard worker. Getting straight A's.
dad.
father, is everything okay up at the church? I saw police.
do you use ag-lime on the church grounds?
Yes.
where do you keep it? I'd like to see it.
sure. Sal, open the shed, would you?
show them the ag-lime? - Yeah, okay.
right there. - You keep the shed locked?
no. It's a church. Who's going to steal from it?
same person who's gonna murder in one.
I'll get a sample and have the crime lab run it against the powder on the body.
thomas Edward Rizzoli, what do you think you're doing?
eating cake.
come in.
Yeah, why not? It's not a party without T. J.
did somebody say "party"?
you people need party lessons.
I'm screwed. She's got a new guy. - That little ho?
pardon me? - Sorry, Mrs. Vanilla.
by the way, how long has Mr. Strawberry fellow been in the picture?
I don't know.
you're the father. It's your job to know.
what's it matter? Stuart's gonna take him from me.
he can't, Tommy.
unmarried fathers are entitled to the same rights.
Yeah, you have a custody order. - There. You see?
well, what if... you, like, got the papers filled out - and you're about to file them... - You didn't file the custody papers.
I meant to.
like you "meant to" put the parking brake on the Cutlass?
what happened with the Cutlass?
it rolled through Mrs. Sutter's garage and blew apart her pool.
that above-ground pool sucked, anyway.
wait. If you have no rights to T. J.neither do I.
I gotta go to work.
that smell in the church was a dead body.
on our first family baptism?
wait. Wait. Can you and Jane fix this Stuart thing?
not everything's "fixable."
unbelievable. I... I don't know what to do. Do you?
well, she hasn't had dental work.
okay. So we can't I. D. her with dental records.
no. And her iliac crest is fused, but it's recent.
she's between the ages of 17 and 22.
did you do a vaginal exam? - Yes. She wasn't raped.
Where's the magnifying thingy?
Yeah. Thank you.
what do you make of those marks? - Marks from the ligature.
quite distinctive ... symmetrical and evenly spaced.
it's not from the locket she was wearing.
chain's too thin.
you think that little girl's our victim?
hmm. It's possible. Similar bone structure.
okay, uh, we'll go out on a limb here. The woman with her ...
so dangerous to make wild leaps ... is it her babysitter?
you're not going to make me say that it's her mother.
I think she just did.
uh, there's something dried on her pants.
Mm. I'll have Susie test it.
there's a receipt in her pocket. - For what?
I don't know. It's faded.
thermal paper doesn't use ink. Fades immediately.
I'll have the crime lab look at it.
her shirt and her pants are both Off-93 apparel.
that's a pretty common brand. I-I can track it, though.
Yeah, do that. - Oh, a tattoo.
Oh, the tissue is inflamed.
it was done within eight hours of her death.
it's homemade. Whoever did it used a ballpoint pen.
maybe she just got out of prison or it's a gang tattoo.
want me to track it through the gang tattoo database?
considering it's the only tattoo database we've have, yes, please.
I live to float.
I'll scan her prints, but I'm not optimistic unless she was arrested.
even if she was a gang-banger, she has a mother.
Hi. I think this is our victim. How old does she look to you?
seven, maybe? - Did you run her prints?
no hits. I'll get an X-ray of her skull from Dr. Lsles and use this photo and do a computer age progression.
I ran a check on the sexual offenders that live near the church ... there's a half a dozen of them.
I don't think we're looking for a sexual offender. She wasn't raped.
is this everybody with keys to the church?
or access to them, yeah. - Any of these guys have a record?
I'll call the Vatican and see what Father Crowley's been up to.
he's a good suspect. He hates everybody, especially Tommy.
how was the christening? - Oh, think of your worst family holiday, - and multiply by ten. - Oh, I'm sorry, Jane.
well, Sal Perez did five years for a string of B&E's.
maybe our victim caught him stealing something from the church?
Yeah, check and see if anything's missing.
Oh, Frankie came by. No hits on that tattoo.
he seems to be taking the new assignment pretty well.
you think this budget-cut story is accurate?
I heard it could happen.
Yeah, but they're not gonna make cuts in homicide, are they?
I don't count on anything.
mayor White laid off 250 cops in the '80s.
I was out for a year.
you were a Shorty Pasquale pizza boy?
I had to pay the rent.
I keep this to remind myself to be grateful.
all right, Maura's got something.
evidence of two spiral fractures ... right radius and left ulna.
so, two people held her down and broke both her arms.
that's one possible scenario. The fractures are small.
it happened within 24 hours of her death.
that's not enough, Maura. I need an hour when she died.
well, adline makes that impossible.
Jane, if I can't narrow down the time of death, you certainly can't.
Strawbridge, Strawberry... - Are you doing what I think you're doing?
how did you know I'm looking at porn?
no, wait, I logged in as you, so Dr. Isles is looking at porn.
Oh. What?! Move over.
Oh, I guess it's all right to be looking up Stuart.
he's a home wrecker. Look.
a rocking farewell to Strawberry.
my new family.
he's taking T. J. to Abilene.
it'll be okay, Ma.
Yeah, Strawberry's a stable guy.
he seems nice. He's got a job. T. J. could do worse.
Tommy couldn't even fill out his papers, Jane.
Yeah, but he loves T. J. Frankie. And so do we.
there's only one thing we can do.
please don't suggest kidnapping to two cops.
we need to get Tommy and Lydia back together.
okay, but they never were "together."
Tommy had a one-night stand and then introduced Lydia ...
I don't care.
I will do whatever I have to do to get my grandbaby back, especially since neither one of you are making any.
ma! Ma.
I know Tommy likes Lydia. - What, did he tell you that?
didn't have to. She likes him, too. That's why they act like 7th-graders when they're around each other.
are you sure that's not a brain problem?
Jane. - What?
well, what if we got the two of them together ...
I mean, in the same place.
well, so, what, we're in "the parent trap" now?
Oh, that's a great idea. - What ... what are you doing? Frankie.
Hey, Lydia. It's Frankie. Jane asked me to call you.
present? No, I didn't get him one yet!
no, she's gonna be stuck at work all day today, so...
it would really mean a lot if you could come by.
great! Yeah, bye.
what the hell? Where am I gonna get a present?
just get Lydia to your apartment, and I'll get Tommy there.
that's a genius idea!
that's a terrible idea. - What, you got a better one?
No?!
that doesn't look good. What?
I can't take any more bad news today. - It's a letter from the brass.
they're saying there might be layoffs. - What?
we might be "reallocated"? What does that mean?
might put us back in uniform, add 911 calls to the job.
can they do that? - Yeah.
at least yours won't suggest you take early retirement.
what about me? Last man in, first man out.
detective Frost, you did a really nice job on the age progression,
I would just extend the nose a little bit and take - another pass on her ears. - All right.
what's wrong? - Jane: Oh, nothing.
we can't identify a dead girl, my nephew is moving to Texas with a Strawberry, and I might have to wear my uniform to work.
Oh. Well, then, this won't help.
the crime lab wasn't able to restore anything on the receipt.
can I see it? What did you try? - Uh, a dry iron and U. V. light.
I might be able to show them an old-school trick. It's worth a try.
come on, Maura. My visitor's here.
come on where? - To your office. It's an emergency.
what kind of emergency?
the kind where you don't ask me any questions and trust me.
I don't like that type of emergency.
I-I wanted to get T. J. something special.
it's a developmental mask.
you can play a really stimulating game of peekaboo.
and research shows that it boosts I. Q. by ten points.
ten whole points? - Mm-hmm.
we're gonna need a lot more masks.
you're such a good aunt. - Oh, well, you know, we all love T. J.
the proposal was real sudden. But Abilene has good schools, and T. J. will be able to have lots of dogs, and...
strawberry will be a good dad. - Mm, a good dad, like Tommy?
he'll change his diaper and sing him to sleep and clean the spit-up... it was so sweet.
Maura: Tommy is so good with that baby.
but T. J. is his son, so... - Yeah.
but we'll have a house, and T. J. will have brothers and sisters.
Stuart wants his own kids.
"his own kids"? Poor T. J.
Oh, yeah. That sounds nice. Call me.
yeah ... we... uh, no. Uh, t-tonight.
what a good idea. - Oh, I can't...
Really? Oh, that's too bad... 'cause with all the budget cuts, tonight's my last night here.
it is? - Yes. They are transferring me...
to Guam. - Whoa, all the way out by Braintree?
farther.
Yeah, let's have a girls' night.
yeah? Okay. - Yes! Yay!
uh, so, um, tonight? 7: 00?
okay. - All right.
okay. - Guam?
sergeant Korsak is in the crime lab, working on the receipt.
okay. I want to get our victim's profile out to the media.
will you please help me with Lydia? - Of course.
but, Jane, that ring that he gave her ... it's a cubic zirconia.
the nerve!
vidal Sassoon always came through for me.
moment of truth.
you did it. There's a name. Cortez Bodega.
there's a date, too. Friday the 28th ... two days ago.
Cortez Bodega is located on Cortez Street... wait a minute.
that's across the street from the Off-93 apparel factory,
which is the same brand of clothing that the victim was wearing.
maybe our victim worked at that factory.
that's why she was shopping at a Bodega across the street.
I'll get Frost and Frankie. We'll check it out.
we'd like to show you a computer-generated photo of what we think she looked like.
and you think she worked here? - We do.
it looks like Isabella. That's her.
she's the daughter of one of our seamstresses.
she started working in packaging two months ago.
do you recognize this woman? - Bianca Valdez, Isabella's mother.
is she working today? - Yes.
I'll go get her.
I talked to the Bodega owner. He remembers the victim.
I got the security-camera video from Friday.
did he remember what she bought? - A religious candle...
and a pregnancy kit. - Oh, boy.
is it Isabella?
she's dead, isn't she? - Yes.
did your daughter go to St. Evillius?
Yes. Every Sunday.
she made her first communion there.
is there any reason she would've been there Friday night?
I don't think so.
she was beautiful. - Inside, too.
so smart, so sweet.
she was accepted into every college she applied to.
why didn't she go?
look, we don't care about your status, okay?
once they knew... - That she was undocumented.
help us find her killer.
we need a list of her friends. - They all went off to college...
and left her behind to work in a factory, - like her mother. - Did Isabella have a boyfriend?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
um, this is our chief medical examiner, Dr. Maura Isles.
I am terribly sorry to tell you that your daughter was four weeks' pregnant.
Oh
I'm so sorry.
can you tell us what this tattoo means?
four Corners. - The Four Corners gang?
we both worked Four Corners drug cases. Never saw one like that.
we found the same mark on your daughter. - It's only for the chosen few special girls the gang leaders want for themselves.
did you know that your daughter was in a gang?
she wasn't in a gang.
four Corners took her, and they killed her.
why do you say that?
once that mark is on you, you're their property.
they kill you if you leave before they're done with you.
my poor girl.
we're gonna do everything we can to find your daughter's killer.
I know you will.
you brought her home to me.
I asked Maura to look up that tattoo in old autopsy photos, see if maybe there were any victims before she was the M. E.
that's a good idea. Isabella's mother said the Four Corners would kill a girl who tried to leave.
Isabella didn't have time to leave. She was killed the same day they inked her. Something else happened.
Jane, I think I found what you're looking for in the archives.
frost, can you look up a cold case ... Araceli Ramirez?
there might be more. I just went back through 2004.
araceli Ramirez was killed near Four Corners in 2004.
all three suspects were gang members.
where are those suspects today? - Two are in prison. One dead.
Isabella clocks in for work at 7: 00 A. M.
goes to the Bodega during lunch, works until 4: 00.
did Frankie say if there was a bathroom in the Bodega?
Yeah, in the back. - So, Isabella takes a full hour for lunch.
maybe she takes the pregnancy test in the store bathroom.
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
and what does an 18-year-old practicing catholic girl with no money do when she finds out she's pregnant?
she definitely doesn't have an abortion. - She talks to a friend.
Yeah. And Isabella didn't have a cellphone, so maybe it was a work friend.
maybe someone with ties to Four Corners.
let's pull employee records and run them.
frost, look for any Off-93 employee who has gang affiliations.
Oh, my god. It's 6: 30, Jane. - So?
so, at 7: 00, people are showing up at your apartment.
Oh, my god. I totally forgot. - Go. We got this.
Thanks, guys!
it's so nice of you to make a homemade dinner.
Yeah. It's not a problem. I love to cook.
isn't she such a good dog? - Oh, yes, she is.
Yes, you are a good doggie. Oh, yes, you are.
so, how fun that you are moving to Abilene.
you can go to the rodeo, and ... and celebrate the pioneer spirit, and, you know, what else are you gonna do?
I just can't wait to fill a house with doggies and kittens and babies.
right, Jo Friday? Who's a good doggie?
who's a good doggie?
Oh. Only you and Tommy can get her to do that.
she doesn't do that for anybody else.
Yeah. Tommy and T. J. would, you know, play with her and take her for walks.
it will be so sad that Tommy can't do that anymore.
yeah... that is sad.
you should hear T. J. laugh when he plays with Tommy.
sad he isn't gonna have his Daddy.
Lydia, can you get that for me?
I-I have a neighbor returning something.
Lydia. - What are you doing here?
moving the couch. - Oh.
uh, where'd you want it, Vanilla? - Where it is.
Frankie said he'd give us 200 bucks to move it.
did he? - Tommy, you should stay for dinner.
Yes, you should. And we'll help you move the couch later.
so sorry for your trouble. - Oh, no ... no trouble. No trouble.
Mmm. That's home cooking. Mmm. That smells good.
why you gotta be like that? - Get out.
get out. - That's no ... Okay. All right.
okay.
here. Sit down. Dinner will be ready soon.
get the dog. - Why?
just do it!
it will just be a couple more minutes.
Oh, Jo Friday! Bad dog!
Oh, your pot roast. Jane.
she sure loves pot roast. - That's so cute.
so, Maura, we should probably get some take-out, right?
Yes. Yeah. - Okay. We'll be fast.
but you two should stay here and keep an eye on Jo Friday.
how come? Well, she could choke on that pot roast.
she has a small gullet.
Bye. Bye.
what are you doing?!
what am I doing? What are you doing?
move.
Jo Friday really likes you.
okay. Okay, she just said that jo Friday really likes Tommy.
well, that's good. Verbal compliments often serve as foreplay, which then lead to the release of dopamine and oxytocin.
Oh, dope and oxycontin? They gonna have a good night.
so, that's the ring he gave you, huh?
he just asked about her ring.- Uh-oh.
do you think he'll notice it's a cubic zirconia?
I think he'll notice it's the size of a grain of sand.
must have cost him a whole $10.
Yeah, he noticed.
at least he has a job! - Ohh, the big box copy boy!
well, it's better than taking money for moving his sister's couch because she feels sorry for you!
Ouch.
wow, you got that food fast. Look, I'm sorry. I just ...
we'll have to do this all in Guam. I have to go.
that went well.
Frankie helped me cross-reference the gang database and Off-93 employee records.
so, did you find Isabella's work friend? - Think so.
Josie Garcia. A member of Four Corners.
she's was arrested six times for assault and battery, - four times for drugs. - Nice friend.
she worked with Isabella in packing. I'm getting Josie's phone records, see if she texted her gang buddies to help her beat up Isabella.
okay.
the substance that Frankie noticed on Isabella's pant leg - Is red candle wax. - She bought a candle at the Bodega.
we need to come up with a way to get rid of Strawberry.
sounds like a conspiracy I don't want to be part of.
I'm gonna grab some coffee. Want any?
no thanks. "Get rid of"?
sounds like the words of a mob boss's daughter.
which I am. Think about it ... everybody has a dark side.
we simply exploit Stuart's. - Really? What's his "dark side"?
did he make copies of his butt at the big box store?
I don't think that's enough.
no, I know he hasn't been arrested. - Oh, did a background check.
you abused your authority.
why don't you keep your voice down, all right?
Yes, I wanted to know if a grown man that goes by "Strawberry"
was ever arrested for child abuse or urinating in public.
the only dark thing I noticed about him were his periorbital circles.
dark circles under his eyes. Stuart has severe allergies.
okay. Well, thank you. That's very helpful, Maura.
but I don't think Lydia's gonna turn down a house and medical insurance and her doggies because Stuart...
has allergies. Oh, my god.
Allergies! - Severe allergies.
that's it! It's ...
warrant came through. I've got Josie's texts...
okay, now we're talking.
to Tito ... "the one you like is pregnant."
it's time-stamped right at her lunch.
and there's a response from this "Tito" person.
"beat her down and ink her." What does that mean?
you can read Latin but you can't understand that?
gang unit lists Tito Varela as the leader of Four Corners.
he's out on parole. - So, Tito wanted Isabella.
and Josie made it her job to deliver. - Sounds right.
Josie texted her two friends after she heard from Tito.
"ball up ink party 4 on Cortez." Latin is simpler.
no, they planned to ambush Isabella on Cortez Street...
until she curled up into a "ball." "4" means 4: 00 ... right after work.
maybe Tito finished her off in the church.
Yeah, check and see if Tito's parole requires electronic monitoring.
Yeah, he's on an ankle bracelet...
but he didn't leave his house from Friday to Sunday.
so that means Tito's not our killer.
let's go see Josie.
is it okay if I take Frankie? He was really helpful.
Yeah. He could use the practice.
take a good look, Josie.
she thought you were her friend. - She was dumb, then.
dumb to tell you she was pregnant.
we didn't do that to her. We inked her. That's all.
you did a little more than that. You broke both of her arms.
not on purpose.
Tito told you to ink her. Why? He want a relationship with her?
"relationship"? Nah. He saw her, her wanted to bang her.
so he wasn't the father of her baby? - No. That's why I had to tell Tito.
she thought she could break away, didn't have to be part of Four Corners.
do you know who the father was? - Some college boy.
what's his name? - I don't know.
think hard, Josie.
you're still looking at murder. - What?!
some guy she met at church. That's all I know.
Jane's told me bits and pieces about Tommy's predicament.
Yeah. I can't imagine losing this little baby.
that's the mother of the girl we found in the church.
ms. Valdez?
good morning.
sergeant, I found something in the back of my daughter's closet.
is that your baby?
Oh, gosh, no. It's ... it's my grandbaby.
I'll never have a grandchild.
could I get you something? A cup of coffee?
no, no. Thank you.
um, Sergeant, please, look inside. I don't know what it means.
Britmore college. - Do you know who it belongs to?
I might.
the church gardener's kid, Samuel Morales, goes to Britmore.
running him.
no arrest record.
I'll get his phone records and his credit cards.
I'll grab Jane. We'll bring him in.
Jane: Samuel, we have the records right here.
you took the 6: 00 P. M. train from New Haven to Boston on Friday.
you came to Boston after Isabella called you on the prepaid phone you bought for her, didn't you?
did Isabella join a gang? She start seeing somebody else?
she make you jealous, Sam? - Isabella wasn't in a gang.
she should've gone to Britmore with me.
she was brilliant.
they inked her because she didn't want be part of Four Corners.
when did you see Isabella's tattoo? - In the church.
I met her there. - Why did you kill her, Samuel?
my father told me that we couldn't be seen together...
or the Four Corner gang-bangers were gonna kill us both.
I left her in that church. Why did I do that?
you left her after you strangled her? - He said he would take care of it.
I want to talk to Father Crowley.
get out of here! I want to talk to Father Crowley!
okay.
I think he might want to confess.
even if he does, it won't be admissable because I can't testify.
understood, Father. But maybe he'll talk to us once he talks to you.
he's in here.
frost! Help us! We've got to get him down!
father, he's still alive! Call an ambulance!
Hey! Someone! Ambulance!
watch his head, watch his head.
come on, Samuel.
come on, buddy. Come on, buddy.
alright. Thanks.
he's in critical condition, but he's alive.
what about brain damage? - They don't think so, but there's a lot of damage to his larynx.
damn. As soon as he gets out of the hospital, he'll be going on trial for killing his girlfriend.
why did Samuel say his father wouldn't let him and Isabella be seen with gang-bangers?
frost, can you look up Mateo Morales?
Yeah. "he said he'd take care of it." What did that mean?
Mateo Morales, Sam's father, was once a Four Corners gang member.
look at the rosary. - Explains the ligature marks.
St. Margaret of Cortona, Patron Saint of single mothers.
Isabella would have given up Samuel and taken care of their baby by herself if she thought that'd give Samuel a better life.
but you knew Samuel would never give up Isabella, didn't you?
you told your son you'd take care of it. He thought you meant that you'd help take care of him and his pregnant girlfriend.
instead, you wrapped that rosary around Isabella's neck and strangled that 18-year-old girl.
I bet we find Isabella's DNA on that rosary.
she belonged to them. - She wasn't a gang member.
she was once they made her one.
I had no choice. She was their property.
they would've killed my son for trying to take her.
you're under arrest for the murder of Isabella Valdez.
it's really nice of you to babysit.
come here, baby. Come here!
copy department knows how to throw a party, that's for sure.
T. J! What's up, buddy? - Oh. Oh, no. I...
I-I-I can't be near animals.
here you go, take that.
I got to go. I got to go. - Wait. Y-you're allergic to dogs?
all dogs? - Take a shower.
and call me ... Oh. Oh. Oh.
take a shower?
uh, well, you know, we can still babysit.
Yeah, um, if you want to go somewhere, you know, or do something.
take advantage of the free babysitting.
well, I can't go to the big box party, so...
we could go for a walk?
Yeah, sure. I'd like that.
have fun. - Bye.
who's that? Who's that?
Yeah! High five, baby.
you don't want to go with that weirdo Strawberry. No.
what do we do if Lydia chooses Strawberry over pets?
then auntie Jane goes rogue again.
we need to discuss your lawless behavior.
not in front of the nephew, Maura.
me. Me. - Can I hold you?
it's okay. It's me ... Daniel.
are you okay? Do you need help?
Jane! I'm double-parked by someone... come on.
just give me a second.
you know, I've given you 1, 200 seconds.
I've been sitting outside waiting for you.
just chill out. - My ... in a bad mood.
maybe the flat tire was an omen and you should just stay at home today.
have you even showered? - No.
this is what you look like when there's no running water.
again? - Yes, again.
I did tell you not to buy it.
when it was an apartment, it was perfect, and then it found out it was becoming a condo, and then everything started falling apart.
you can have it for a cup of coffee.
all right, come on. We'll stop on the way.
that better be the building manager.
uh, hey, Jane.
I thought you would be gone... by now.
why, because I've been waiting for you since yesterday, Gilbert?
Gil. Man. Impatient, right?
she hasn't showered. - Or had a cup of coffee.
please, tell me. When did Boston join the Third world?
I have seven renters to keep happy. Condo owners are last priority.
you can always sell.
you know what? Don't start again with that, okay?
just get me some water ... please.
I'll see what I can do.
is that it? - Yeah, that's it.
was he just staring at my boobs?
47% of men look at a woman's breasts during a conversation.
every time? - It's unclear.
why would you bring the poop inside?
Hey, Maura. - Hello, Tommy.
just make sure that Gilbert skeevy doesn't go through my underwear.
clean ones or dirty? - Oh, my god, Tommy.
could you ... don't! Throw that away.
outside.
non-fat, no-foam latte for Maura.
thank you.
triple latte for Claire. - Thank you. Have a lovely day.
excuse me. I ordered before her.
Double-frap, no whip for Bill. - Thank you.
and I ordered before him. - Be patient.
she says, as she drinks her latte. - I'm gonna go get some stevia.
I'm gonna watch people who ordered after me get their coffee before me.
Oh, I love your outfit. It's so cute.
thank you. - You're welcome.
have you seen the stevia?
Yeah. Right here. Oh, love this stuff.
double-shot espresso for Reggie.
Hey, thanks. - You're welcome.
Hey, we got a call.
how long ... did you go to Costa Rica to get the coffee beans?
how long does it take to make a latte?
some people are so grumpy. Jane.
thank you.
first I'm freezing, and then I'm sweating.
it's like, global warming is so upsetting.
excuse me.
excuse me.
excuse me.
I didn't hear you. You don't have to be rude.
just trying to get to work. - Well, someone's in a bad mood.
it'd be better if you would just share the milk and sugar.
okay. - All right.
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. - Oh, god.
what happened? - Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my god, what ... Jane, what happened?
Oh, your friend threw her coffee at me.
no. No, no, no. I didn't. It was an accident. I'm so sorry.
it was on purpose.
no, no. You bumped into me.... - I bumped into you? You burned me.
I mean, I wasn't moving fast enough for you.
I'm really, really sorry. Are you okay? Are you burned?
don't touch me. Don't... don't touch me again.
I didn't touch you at all.
I'm a doctor. Can I ... can I help you?
just ... everyone just get away from me, okay?
it was an accident. - Okay, Jane. Let's just go.
what a bitch.
okay. Let's just get out of here.
I didn't mean to. - Of course you didn't.
and I didn't get any coffee. - Here, take mine.
what about you? - It's okay. Let's go.
it's a fluid situation in this usually quiet Boston neighborhood.
what we know so far ... an elderly man holed up inside...
homicide's running the scene?
only till SWAT gets here.
we think the guy in the standoff killed somebody inside.
sir, please, step back.
dude... who's that?
damn. She must be from the new crop of rookies.
does she know how hot she is?
why don't you go over there and tell her?
detective.
stop checking out the pretty cop and make yourselves useful.
I need eyes around the back.
Hey, excuse me.
any idea how long my street's gonna be blocked?
might be a few hours. Do you know the guy in the house?
Leroy? Uh, he's crazy. - What do you mean by crazy?
you know, nut-ball conspiracy theorist.
he's always going off about, uh, U.F. O.s and government spies and...
well, I guess I better call my office, huh?
officer Hansen? Let me introduce you.
detectives, this is officer Charlotte Hansen.
Oh, Charlie. Nice to meet you.
we need eyes in the back.
take Charlie, show her the ropes. I'll be out front.
Yeah. Right here. - Okay.
Oh. You look like you've already had a bad morning.
me? Oh, no. I haven't showered,
I had a skeevy building manager check out my boobs,
I spilled 16 ounces of hot coffee on some perfect stranger.
Yeah, no, I'm great.
operations said there was a body inside?
well, all we know for sure is what the gunman told the 911 operator.
911. What is your emergency?
they're watching me, stealing from me!
sir, please stay calm. I need your address.
Oh, no, no. Daniel's dead.
it's possible he's suffering from persecutory delusions.
who's Daniel?
we think it's a sanitation worker ... Daniel Raine.
we found his truck at the end of the block.
what do we know about the gunman? - Leroy Grovner.
72-year-old retired engineer, lives alone, no relatives.
do we know if he's on any medications?
Oh, he doesn't trust doctors.
last time he saw one was in the E. R. six months ago.
psychotic break? - Broken hip.
first responders said they tried to talk to him but he said, if he talks, it will only be to a lady cop.
stay away from my house!
hold your fire!
hold your fire! You see what I see? - Yeah. Smoke. He's shooting blanks.
all right. Everybody just stand down.
Hey, stand down. He's shooting blanks. - Maura, come on.
it's all right ... easy.
Mr. Grovner. It's okay.
what do you want? - It's all right, okay?
we... we just want to ... we want to help Daniel.
okay? Can we do that, please?
I'm a doctor. If you let me see him, maybe I can help him.
Oh, all ... all right.
but it ... but it's a ... it's a mess down ... down there.
can I hold that for you?
it's all right. All right. Thank you.
stand down!
all right. It's all right. You know what?
why ... why don't we go sit down in one of the cars, okay?
why don't you take this? Go check on Daniel.
all right.
let's ... just go right over here. Okay? - Okay.
Maura? - Down here.
he's been dead for a few hours. - When's the power coming back on?
if we get lost down here, they're never gonna find us.
public works doesn't know why it went off, so they're having a hard time restoring it.
Yeah. It's a garbage man, all right.
Daniel Raine. Works for the sanitation department.
what's he doing down here? - Overtime?
you have enough light?
enough to see a penetrating wound resulting in a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
what's unusual is the wound pattern.
somebody hit him hard. That's a lot of blood.
what did they hit him with? A lawn mower?
sewing machine? Crock-pot?
I think we can rule out the crock-pot.
whatever it was, it had a very sharp, jagged edge.
we talked to the neighbors.
they said Leroy started screaming about space ships and little green men.
Yeah, right after the lights went out. Then he started shooting.
okay, so the aliens landed, and he lost his marbles.
well, maybe they're down here. Seems like everything else is.
except the murder weapon.
all right, let's, uh, let's start a search.
Hey. An 8-track player. And a flowbee.
I always wanted one of these. - Next birthday. On me.
Hey, Korsak, let's you and I go back and interrogate Leroy.
frost, Frankie, you guys do the search, okay?
okay. - Why me?
well, it's either hoarder duty or liquor licenses for me.
I'm gonna have to get this body back to the morgue.
well, leave Frankie, then I can start the background investigation.
all right. - Detectives. Need anything else?
uh, yeah. Detective Frost was just...leaving.
well, I could use your help.
okay.
you know what, Detective Frost? Why don't you stay?
Yeah. Yeah, uh, there's a lot of work to do here.
Yes, there's a lot of work to do here.
crazy, right? Almost 49, 000 hits already.
it's going totally viral.
okay, how do you get it off of this thing?
I don't want people to see this. - It's funny, Ma.
Aww. Isn't that nice?
enjoying a video of your sweet daughter. - You saw it?
several times, along with everyone at headquarters. Let's see it again.
it really gives me a chuckle.
you trying ... you trying ... you trying ...
I didn't touch you at all. I didn't touch you at all.
Oh, you must be very proud.
it's awesome. - Get away.
she's gonna be famous, mom. I'm gonna send her the link.
don't you do that!
you catch the garbage man stealing your stuff, you whack him over the head.
maybe you didn't mean to hit him so hard.
I don't like it in here. I'm only talking to the nice lady.
I got this.
it's okay, Leroy. I'm here.
why don't you just tell me what happened?
not you. You took my gun. The nice doctor lady.
I'm Dr. Maura Isles. Can you tell me your name?
Leroy. Leroy Grovner.
Hello, Mr. Grovner. - Let's start with...
no one likes it when someone steals your stuff.
I don't see the value in stating the obvious.
but ... but it's ... it's my name, and you asked.
just say it.
I'm sure you felt frustrated when your belongings were taken.
I thought I was going crazy at first. And I'm not crazy, you know.
my things, they were disappearing into thin air.
but then I realized who it was ... them.
them?
they've been sniffing around, spying on me.
ask him who.
who's been spying? - Them ... stealing and spying.
who's "them"? - Poor old guy, I wonder if he even knows.
so, the next time I heard them over me, I used the bug zapper. Got them good.
okay, ask him what he means by "got them.
how did you get them? - Took them down.
they were mad. They came looking for me because I had it.
you had what? - They got ... they got Daniel instead.
okay. Ask him about the bug zapper.
is that the murder weapon?
Leroy, is that how Daniel died? You zapped him?
no, I ... I didn't kill him. He was my friend !
he gave me good stuff from his ... from his garbage route.
he even gave me a TX-78 sump pump.
you think Daniel was bringing stuff for the basement, - and then Leroy got confused and killed him? - Yeah, maybe.
I hate to speculate. We don't know what Daniel was doing there.
Hey, who are you talking to?
are they here? - I....
they're here. - No, Leroy. Nobody is here.
it's not gonna work. You can't have my things!
how does a frail 79-year-old with a hip fracture take out a guy Daniel's size?
adrenaline? Fear?
no one's here but me.
that may be a killer ass, but it's not the murder weapon.
Yay.
glad the power's back on. - Yay.
she's not your type. - Oh, oh, that's my type.
in your dreams. - Well, so she's your type?
she's exactly my type.
I mean, do you guys know what the murder weapon looks like?
I'll have more information once I hear back from the medical examiner, but look for anything that could be used as a club.
okay, yeah. I'm getting a lot of electric blankets and blenders.
me, too. I mean, I got a pogo stick, a dentist drill.
and... what the hell is this? - Oh, my gosh. That's an aebleskiver pan.
my grandma, she's Norwegian. Uh, she makes them all the time.
they're, like, these cute little pancake balls.
Yumy. Introduce me to your grandmother.
okay.
uh, so, do we just bag it all, or... - Um, well, uh...
he's pretty junior. I'm in homicide, so...
let's bag everything near where the body was.
got it.
whoa, sir. This is a crime scene.
Oh, no, it's okay. I live next door.
no, it isn't okay. I need to ask you to leave now.
I, uh, brought you some lemonade. I thought you guys might be thirsty.
no. We're not thirsty. Come on. Let's go.
Yeah, well, why don't I... I'll just leave it here?
you can bring the pitcher back later.
the yellow house with the white picket fence.
no, you can't leave that here. Come on.
let's go.
Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah.
Oh, listen, uh, Leroy, uh, borrowed a bunch of stuff over the years and never returned it, so if you happen to come across a metric wrench set or, uh, a pair of old hockey skates, uh, I'd really like to get them back.
we'll keep an eye out. - Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
he was struck at least twice, and whatever instrument was used left an odd pattern in the wound.
can you narrow it down?
it's interesting.
symmetrical linked hexagons, like a honeycomb.
would be the first time anybody died from being bashed in the head with a beehive.
it's not a beehive.
I'm putting my money on an electric toothbrush.
or maybe the knitting machine.
you know, I've never seen anything like it.
okay. - There's particulate in the wound.
I'll run it through GCMs. - Okay.
that's Frost and Frankie.
want to tell them what to look for.
Hey, Dr. Isles.
we're still sorting through junk. Nothing promising so far.
well, the murder weapon is approximately the size of a baseball bat.
Yeah, and it has a beehive attached to it.
a what?
it has an edge that will look like a honeycomb.
so... it's not robotman?
you know what, Frankie?
why don't you try acting like a real Detective?
Oh, you mean like this?
out of my way, or I'm gonna throw my extra-hot triple latte on you!
Oh, no! Please don't, officer!
wait a minute. How do you know about that?
you haven't seen it? - Seen what?
go on Youtube.
okay.
okay, now type in "mean Detective Jane.
I didn't touch you at all.
it was on purpose.
you know what? Don't... don't touch me again.
I didn't touch you at all.
what a bitch. - Here, take mine.
wait. No. I didn't say that!
they must have lip-dubbed you. That is expert editing.
okay, wait, now you're an expert on viral videos, too?
come on, it's funny.
et tu, Brute?
well, it is kind of funny. - Not if you're me.
Hi, honey. - Oh, yay. I'm pregnant.
don't I have to have sex to be pregnant?
okay, for heaven's sake, we had a party for Darlene in accounting.
I thought you could use some cheering up.
why would I need cheering up?
just because my video is more popular than that monkey flinging his poop?
so, you spilled a little coffee. - Or threw it.
I did not throw it!
mm, in slo-mo, it kind of looks like you might've.
okay. I'm going to leave this in case you want any later.
none for you! - Thanks, Ma.
okay, turn that off or I will throw Darlene's cake at you.
what do we know about Leroy?
well... Leroy was telling the truth.
he and Daniel were friends.
Leroy seems harmless. My gut says he's no killer.
Yeah, me too.
but we're putting him in lockup with a bunch of creeps.
all right, so let's get him a psych eval, buy him some time in the hospital.
at least he'll stay alive.
good idea. - What about Frost and Frankie?
they come up with the murder weapon yet?
not yet.
stuff's coming into the crime lab for processing, though.
why don't we remove the pretty rookie and they can get focused?
another good idea. I'll call it in.
echo 4-0-2. I'm off on an L-20 here.
Yeah. - Frankie, look at this.
what is it? - I think Leroy made an E. M.P. gun.
an electromagnetic pulse gun?
Yeah, with an old-school approach.
does it work? - I don't know.
maybe we should find out.
echo 4-0-2. I'm off on an L-20 here.
where you gonna aim it? - Uh, definitely not at the houses.
uh, maybe there? - Go for it.
10-4. On my way.
Hello?
Ah, I think we just took out the electrical systems in the cruisers.
uh, that could be expensive. Let's get back in the basement.
Oh, hey, you guys?
uh, something just happened to the radio in my car.
weird. - Oh, that happens all the time.
Oh. Phew. Thought I did something.
just call the guys in the shop. They'll take care of it.
okay. Thanks.
why don't you talk to him, nice lady?
Hello, Leroy.
is that my stuff? - Yes.
better all be there. - It was all inventoried, but why don't you check through it to make sure?
I want to go home.
they're probably in there right now, taking my things.
Mr. Grovner, you understand you're not being released?
the judge has ordered that you have an evaluation at a hospital.
Yeah, cause they all think I'm ... I'm crazy.
everyone thinks I'm crazy. I'm not crazy.
I believe you.
I'll do anything to prove I didn't kill Daniel.
he wasn't stealing from me. It was someone else.
uh, can I borrow your notepad?
Thanks.
Mr. Grovner, why don't you describe to me the items that you're missing?
um, my, uh, my circuit boards, and an antique bird cage, and hockey stuff.
circuit boards, antique? - Yeah.
bird cage. Hockey equipment.
my dad was an equipment manager for a hockey team.
saved all of it and gave it to me before he died.
yeah? Okay. I'll file an incident report and see if I can get you your things back.
I'm ... I'm sorry. - Why do you say that?
I thought that you weren't a nice lady, but ... but you are.
thank you.
okay. Come on, Leroy. You're gonna be just fine.
Yes, sir. - In my office ... now.
is it too late to call in sick?
you want a union rep? - Why, do I need one?
well... you might.
excuse me. Excuse me.
someone's in a bad mood.
just trying to get to work.
get away ... get away ... get away from me.
don't touch me.
it was an accident. - Yeah, we all know that, but that woman says you gave her second-degree burns.
Oh, my god.
we have to investigate you. - What? Why?
because she's filed a police-brutality complaint against you.
it's not the end of the world. - Yeah, I know.
I'd be amazed if anybody outside BPD even saw it.
it has 79, 000 hits, Maura.
well, I'll bet you they're mostly Europeans.
europeans?
Hey, Coop. Hey, Cooper.
hey ... Coop, it's me. What?
Cooper. He must be picking up on your anxiety.
my anxiety? - Yeah, we're late for Mah-jongg.
wait, what ... what anxiety? - Uh, come on, Cooper.
I'm not gonna let her spill anything on you, I promise.
so, Ms. Billings is European?
Oh, hey, look.
it's that cop that throws coffee at people.
Hey, all right, move along. - Oh, yeah.
do you throw doughnuts at little kids on school buses, too?
okay, that's harassment.
Oh, yeah? Why don't you come arrest me?
no, ignore him. Come on.
I just want to take a shower.
just want to take a shower. That's it.
yo, sister.
Hey. Did Gilbert fix my water?
Gil is cool. - Tommy, did he fix my water?
I don't think so.
he had to take another call, but he did do that.
Tommy! How could you let him do that?
there's a leak in the building, Jane. It might even be black mold.
think we'll have to wear those mask thingies?
I don't see any signs of mold. - How am I supposed to take a shower?
Jane, come on. You can stay at my place.
Gil was asking about you. I think he likes you.
swell.
Oh, oh, here it is. Here it is.
and if you think you've had a bad day, be glad you're not Boston Detective Jane Rizzoli, who finds herself in hot water after spilling scalding coffee on a stranger.
is he? Is that?
we talked to her brother to find out if there is more to this story.
Oh, Jane has a temper, all right.
Oh, yeah. When we were growing up, nobody messed with us, cause if they did, Jane would kick the crap out of them.
you did an interview in my apartment?
thought this was a condo. - In my apartment?!
I mean, I said a lot of nice things about you.
Tommy! - They must've cut them out.
why would you ... get out.
get out now! Get out now.
Jane Rizzoli? - Yes.
you've been served.
I can't ... I... She sued me. - Goodbye.
Vince... thanks for coming.
sure. Is she here? - Yep.
upstairs taking a shower.
this lawsuit looks like a boiler plate. Thought they filed it fast.
boiler plate? So, it's bullshit?
sorry, I'm ... I'm upset.
you're right. You never know what a jury will do. Poor Jane.
you know, I liked it better before the computer media cloud stuff.
me, too. You could have a conversation.
you want some coffee? - Love some.
you want a little irish whiskey in it? - Sure, but skip the coffee.
half a million bucks? That's what she wants?
can you believe it?
Vince, Jane doesn't have that kind of money unless she sells her condo.
it won't come to that. She was on the job.
the city has to cover legal costs. - Well, I'm still gonna help her.
you're a good mom.
Oh, I didn't know you were in here. - My back hurts.
high cortisol levels from stress.
why would I be stressed?
just a coffee-throwing b-b-b-b-b-bitch.
stop. It was one moment in a life.
one moment caught on tape.
well, let it go. Ujjayi breath. - "Ooh-jie" who?
it's a deep, cleansing breath. Just focus on the present.
I'm trying, but you're vibrating.
it's Susie. The particulate found in the victim's head wound was fiber-reinforced polymer.
is that animal, vegetable, or mineral?
mineral. It's a fine mixture of glass, carbon, and basalt.
and what's that used for? - High-tech applications.
it's used as a structural component in everything from skyscrapers to aircraft.
high-tech murder weapon.
wonder if Leroy found something and drug it into his basement.
you're a very good Detective. And a very good person... Once you've had your coffee.
Yeah, I let the little things get to me today.
we all do, Jane.
just take a deep breath and stay in the present.
why does work always know when I'm trying to stay in the present?
what? When?
all right, get two more uniforms over there. Thanks.
what is it?
somebody tried to break into Leroy's basement.
all right, thank you. - Morning.
that was the sergeant at the crime scene.
they kept the flood lights on all night. So far, so good.
that's got to be our killer, don't you think?
and what is so valuable in there that you would risk getting caught?
good thing the guys on watch were paying attention.
maybe Daniel was down there looking for the same thing, and that's why he's dead.
who left these here?
I don't know, but they'll get sick of teasing you pretty soon.
Oh, it's still hot. Thank you.
it's very thoughtful.
did, uh, Frost and Frankie find anything that could be the murder weapon?
maybe. You said high-tech? They found something.
CSRU is bringing it in for Maura to have a look at.
all right, this is Maura.
she's confirmed it's made of fiber-reinforced polymer ...
the same stuff she found in the victim's head wound.
sounds like our murder weapon. - Yeah.
you want to be Claire or Maura?
doesn't matter, as long as you don't throw the other one at me.
good one. - Thank you.
any idea what it is? - I'm not sure.
it looks pretty small to be the murder weapon.
it's not the murder weapon, but it might be made of the same materials.
Yeah. It's really light.
stiffness and strength at a very low weight. It's because of this.
you see the honeycomb-like structure?
Yeah, it looks like the marks that were pounded into Daniel's head.
now, what the hell is it?
you said high-tech applications?
I mean, it's a long shot, but what if we did a patent search, find out what we're looking for?
two days in a hoarder's basement. I'm officially claustrophobic.
Ah, we're almost done.
I don't believe this. B. O.number 4?
do you know whose skate this is? - Can't be. No.
it's the right size. - Did we just find Bobby Orr's skate?
I think we did.
Hey, wait.
you remember that neighbor guy who tried to bring us lemonade?
Yeah. Yeah, and he had that story about lending Leroy his hockey skates.
what guy brings lemonade? - You're right.
and if this really is Bobby Orr's skate, it's crazy valuable.
maybe friendly neighbor is really friendly neighborhood murderer.
which means we're looking for the murder weapon in the wrong house.
that's him ... Mac Hazlet.
he's quite the successful e-bay entrepreneur.
antiques, collectibles, hockey memorabilia.
started raking it in about six months ago.
Leroy broke his hip six months ago.
frost, see if you can find the E. R. admissions report.
you thinking Mac discovered Leroy's antiques road show in his basement - and started stealing his stuff? - Yep.
Wow. Was Mac. He's listed on the report.
says he heard Leroy's cries for help and called 911.
you know something?
mac needs to pick on someone his own age.
you sold Terry o'Reilly's hockey glove, Phil Esposito's stick.
you just listed one of Bobby Orr's skates.
the left one. I wonder where the right one is.
be a lot more valuable as a pair. I'm a Big Bruins fan.
where do you find this great stuff? - Um, uh, here and there.
uh, flea markets, private collectors.
so, not next door in Leroy's basement?
I took a few things.
I mean, you know, it was just sitting there collecting dust.
I wanted to put it in the hands of guys like you who really appreciate it.
Oh, that was really nice of him, wasn't it, Sergeant?
what murder weapon?
the metal club you used to kill the garbage man.
I didn't kill anybody.
our colleagues are tearing apart your house as we speak.
you can't do that. - A judge said we can.
you could make it easy on everyone.
just tell us where the murder weapon is.
I'm not telling you crap. - You're under arrest for larceny.
7: 59 A. M. Do you know what that means?
it was one minute before 8: 00?
and what time do you go on duty? - 8: 00.
the good news is, this is no longer a police-brutality case.
Oh, that is good news.
what's the bad news? - It's a civil matter.
and because you weren't on the clock, the city's refusing to indemnify you.
you can't be serious. So I'm on my own?
look at that ... another 17 cents.
I wonder if F. Lee Bailey will take your case now.
if I tell him to shut up, do you think he'll put it on Youtube?
I wouldn't put it past him. Okay, where's Maura?
I want to know what that lawyer said.
well? - I brought Matcha tea.
it's from Utashinai. You want to try some?
Maura, what did he say?
Oh, look, another 50 cents.
Rizzoli, get over here and help your customers.
Yes, Mr. Stanley. - Okay, just tell me what he said.
he said it would be expensive to defend.
I just spilled coffee. - I know.
it's a frivolous lawsuit, but he looked at the video, and if she has medical expenses or compensatory damages ...
for crying out loud. Just ... how much is it to hire him?
he wants a $25, 000 retainer.
Oh, my god. Maura, every cent I have is in my condo.
I know.
I know. I could live in Leroy's basement.
Oh, come on. Let me help you.
you know, I'll just cash out some mutual funds.
no. I can't take your money.
don't look at that.
I can't believe I'm gonna lose my home over this.
Maura, look at her blouse.
no.
that. You see it now?
her blouse is repelling the droplets of coffee.
wait, that could be made of a scald-proof nanofabric.
help for the fashion-challenged.
Teflon-nanotube coating is used on some textiles to produce scald-proof fabrics.
so, she set it up.
she even had somebody there to tape it.
you think she wanted you to spill your coffee so she could sue?
but how'd she know you were a cop?
I'll be damned. - What? What do you see?
whirls and ridges.
whoever videotaped it left a fingerprint on the camera lens.
we should run that.
Yes! Yes!
Oh, yes!
I found the patent. I know what this is.
it's a piece of a new type of rotor blade from a drone.
from a drone? - Yeah. Manufactured by JFP.
Jarvis Flight Project.
that would explain the honeycomb interior.
and the edge of the rotor blade is consistent with the wound pattern.
how does a piece of a drone end up in Leroy's basement?
maybe he dragged it inside after he shot it down with the bug zapper.
E. M.P. would destroy the drone's electronic system ...
probably cause a power outage, too.
Yeah, but do we know if that even works?
Oh, yeah. It works. - Really? How do you know that?
well ... - Have anything to do with the two cruisers who got their brains fried at the crime scene?
I think I'll take the fifth.
drones can be used for corporate espionage.
and Leroy was convinced that he was being watched, spied on.
spy on an old man's house with a million-dollar drone?
maybe they were spying on the neighborhood.
frontload Tech just moved its R&D offices right nearby.
Yeah, but there would be a ton of firewalls to protect proprietary information.
Yeah, but look at all these houses sold. Frost, who lives around Leroy?
frontload Tech engineers. A lot of them.
that's it. You take your phone and your computer home.
if I wanted to steal, I would send a drone, fly it over your home.
it was doing a war-drive ...
piggybacking on wi--Fi networks and downloading everything.
frost, look up JFP's website. - Got it right here.
what else does JFP do?
they offer intelligence-gathering services.
look who's head of the division.
we saw him outside Leroy's house at the standoff.
Jim Blackman ... former Navy Seal, specializes in military-intelligence gathering.
said he was a neighbor.
Yeah, except he lives 20 miles away.
could you track the drone sent out back to Leroy's basement?
Yes. It had a GPS locator.
this is a picture of Jim at the crime scene.
he told me he had to get to the office,
the break-in last night.
but what? I mean, we went through everything.
what did Leroy have in his pockets when we brought him in?
69 cents, package of tums, a rabbit's foot.
and a miniature hard drive. Can you punch in on that?
it's ... it's hard to see, but I'm pretty sure it's stamped "JFP.
JFP ... Jim Blackman's drone-manufacturing company.
we need to find Jim. I'm gonna make sure Leroy's safe first.
Hey, this is Detective Rizzoli. I need a status report on Leroy Grovner.
he's been released.
Where's the hard drive you stole? - Stop it.
tell me where it is! - Leave me alone!
you're the reason your friend is dead. - You shouldn't have killed Daniel.
and you shouldn't have shot down my drone and taken it apart.
now, where is it? Where's the hard drive you stole?
police have it. - You're a liar!
you tell me where it is or you're a dead man.
Jim, it's over. Put the gun down.
no. Don't move or I'll blow the old man's head off.
let's all just calm down.
like I said, Jim, it's over.
I'm not going down. I'm gonna take you with me.
what? With Leroy's shotgun? - Damn straight.
Leroy, you load that like you did before?
sure did. - You're a military man, Jim.
you ought to recognize the difference between live ammo and blanks.
that's for Daniel, you miserable yo-yo.
come on, Jim. Quit your whining.
Leroy, you okay?
all my stuff. My whole ... my whole life.
it's all ... it's all gone. - I-it's not gone, Leroy.
we'll get your stuff back.
Yeah.
we got a hit on that fingerprint. You recognize that name?
Yeah. I sure do.
I was thinking desert tones with a pop of cactus green.
what do you think?
I think you're a little too far East for a Southwest decor.
especially in a historic building. - Jane, I can explain.
to a judge. What? You did this for my condo?
that's crazy.
it's even crazier to leave your fingerprints on the camera lens, and that's all over youtube, too.
it was, uh, Gil's idea. I was happy living on the ground floor.
Oh, right.
baby, please, could we convert the third floor?
it's the nicest spot in the building. Please, please, please?
I do not talk like that. - You see what I'm dealing with?
okay. We'll get you separate cells. You're under arrest for fraud.
I cannot believe I hooked up with you!
you hooked up wime. - Right. Oh...
hold on, I want to show you something.
come here. - What?
if I'm in it, I don't want to see it.
I'm sorry. - Why do you say that?
I thought you weren't a nice lady, but ... but you are.
you know, we live in a dual-party consent state.
I could sue you for secretly taping me.
go ahead and try. I have a good attorney.
it has 11 hits, Maura. - Give it some time.
what? For the "Europeans" to discover it?
okay, maybe we need to spice it up, add a little music.
Yeah. We can dub in... "b-b-b-b-bitch!
that was good. I could rap for you.
that's ... that's spitting. That's ... that's not rapping.
that's what they do. - No. No.
here. You're all right. Got some...
I don't like quinoa. It's too grainy.
it's not a grain. It's a chenopod.
well, I don't like "keenopads." - Chenopod.
quinoa is closely related to beets, spinach, and tumbleweed.
tumbleweed?
Yes, put that at the top of my "do not serve" list, too.
are you having second thoughts? - Well, I can't back out now.
I mean, Dr. Nolan asked us to do this presentation six months ago.
and, yes, I do not enjoy thinking about Hoyt.
I mean, serial killers go after complete strangers.
how'd I manage to get the one who wanted to get personal?
well, you presented a unique challenge to someone like Charles Hoyt.
so you're saying it's a compliment that he tried to kill me?
I suppose.
let's go over the presentation again. - Okay.
all right, two setups at the blood cottage.
the first is the West Roxbury mansion, where we found Martin Yeager's body.
his wife, Gail, was missing, but we found evidence of a second body and eventually discovered Gail's body in a remote area.
Mm. - What's the matter?
just remembering the motile sperm I found on her body.
Yeah, right? It's not bad enough that he's a serial killer.
no, no. Can be a necrophiliac, too.
Yay. Three-Day symposium where we can re-live our four-year nightmare.
only Dr. Nolan could convince me to do something like this.
did you finish it? - Yes, I made myself, but I thought she did a really good job with the forensics.
Yeah, I did, too. She sold 100, 000 copies so far.
america loves a serial killer.
Oh, can you get it? - Yeah.
Dr. Nolan. Hi. Thank you. Please come in.
so nice to see you both. - Welcome.
this is my research assistant, Jack Roberts, and my publicist, Tim Felding.
so nice to meet you, Detective, Doctor.
I've heard so much about you both. - Oh?
we've been together for six months on my book tour.
tim humors me by listening to my stories. Hardly humoring you.
there is a reason that your book's a best-seller. Well, congratulations on the success.
thank you, but I'll be glad to get back to my research. Would you like to join us for dinner?
Oh, that's very nice of you, but I need to make some phone calls, get ahead of any controversy over tonight's presentation.
you think the blood cottage will be controversial?
we have had press ask to cover it.
my worry is it might appear to be a bit gratuitous to the layperson.
well, let the press know that it's a powerful investigative training tool.
what a great way to spin it.
what time should we pick you up? Um...
uh, we can take you. - Thank you. That's very kind of you.
great. Well, we'll see you there. - Lovely.
my new role as a book author came with an entourage.
well, who doesn't love an entourage?
Mmm. This is so delicious.
Mm. Props, even for the quinoa. - Thank you.
Dr. Nolan, what is forensic psychiatry, exactly?
it's a branch of medicine that focuses on the intersection of law and mental health.
and why did you decide to specialize in serial killers?
mom. - It's all right. I get asked that a lot.
during my psychiatric residency, a 5-Year-Old boy was referred to me for treatment.
Why? What happened to him?
ma. - I want to know.
he'd strangled his puppy. - A 5-year-old?
Yeah. So, see? Tommy's not so bad after all.
not funny. - Okay.
but what made you decide to focus on these three?
they were a good sample.
Charles Hoyt was a brilliant medical student, which is unusual. - Why?
well, most serial killers are of average intelligence.
Yeah, like these two ... Gilbert Dean Reeder was a trucker.
david James Johnson was married with children.
so, he had a family? Isn't that unusual?
no, not really. - How could his wife not know?
well, not every serial killer is a social misfit or a monster, Ma.
unfortunately, they're so normal, they hide in plain sight.
that's what makes them so hard to stop.
well, we should get going.
why can't I go with you?
I told you, it is only for law enforcement.
even I find the blood cottage disturbing.
it looks real, Ma.
the crime-scene techs, they set up forensic dummies.
how do they make the dummies look real? - You'd be surprised.
they bleed synthetic gel. It's not pretty.
okay. Who thinks of this stuff?
we agree on the definition of a serial killer ...
three or more murders ... but what we don't agree on are the investigative techniques, and that's why we're here.
tonight, we begin with Detective Jane Rizzoli and Dr. Maura Isles.
if you've read my book...
you know that these two were instrumental in the capturing of serial killer Charles Hoyt.
thank you. It's very nice to be here.
putting a stop to Hoyt's killing spree became very personal for me.
during the course of my investigation,
Hoyt developed an obsession with me and tried to kill me more than once.
the truth is, this is difficult to talk about.
I'm glad that he's dead...
because he can't hurt anyone else, ever.
but I will never stop wondering why. - We know about 70% of serial killers were abused as children, and 60% have brain damage.
but we also know that every society has them.
so tonight, we focus not on why but on how ...
how we investigate.
what you're about to see is a staged crime scene. It's what we call a blood cottage.
we will show you how we analyzed the forensic details of the murder of Martin Yeager and his wife, Gail.
when we arrived at the crime scene that you're about to see,
martin Yeager was duct-taped and slaughtered, and his wife, Gail, was missing.
um, this teacup was one of Hoyt's signatures.
he, uh, would place it on the man's knee and ...
and use it as a warning device.
does he look a little too real to you?
what's going on? - I don't know.
excuse us just for a second, please. He looks real because he is real.
whoever did it wanted to get to us ...
wanted to get to all of us. - It worked.
Jenkins. - What do you need, Detective?
keep everybody at least 10 feet away from the stage, okay?
it's a crime scene, even if they are cops.
you got it. - Thanks.
Hi. - Hi.
you okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
what did you get from campus security?
well, they said it's an all-cop symposium, so there was no need for additional security.
they got that wrong. - Yeah.
what about access? - Auditorium is always open.
all right, tell the uniforms not to let anybody leave.
these guys are all cops, Jane. - Well, they're all suspects now.
all right.
you were right ... both BPD crime-scene techs.
found their uniforms and badges backstage.
I don't recognize either one of them. Do you?
no. - What's in the box?
props they brought to dress the crime scenes.
all right, we're gonna need all of the campus security footage, okay?
made the calls. It's already coming in.
what do you make of this?
everybody here had experience with serial killers.
this is like some taunt ...
like, "I can do this, and you can't stop me."
smacks of Hoyt, doesn't it? - Yeah... I'm not sure.
but what about the teacup, Jane?
it's the same pattern as the Yeagers' crime scene.
is there a teacup in the prop box?
Yeah.
okay. That means the killer brought his own.
there are 100, 000 copies of Dr. Nolan's book out there.
is there a photo of the teacup in the book?
right there.
Yeah, you can just make out the pattern.
so whoever has this book could've re-created this.
Yeah, it may not be connected to Hoyt at all. So we're looking at, what ...
8, 000 BCU students, 950 faculty and employees?
and all those cops. - Can you estimate the time of death?
I measured their core temperatures.
they were both at 35 degrees celsius. They died about two hours ago.
let me show you something over here.
looks like a burn.
Hoyt used a stun gun. That's not from a stun gun.
I found an identical mark on our male victim's arm.
is that a burn or a branding?
Yeah. Um, go talk to her. Maybe she can help.
what should I do? - The Detectives think that we should keep the symposium going.
Why? - The suspect might be here.
you think he might be part of the law-enforcement community?
I'm wondering how I should respond to the press.
you should let the public information officer handle it right now.
I have seen so many grisly photos and videos of crime scenes, but I've never actually seen...
Dr. Nolan, are you all right?
doctor, take a seat. - No, no, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I just ... - You want some water?
no, no, no. I knew them, the crime-scene techs, June and Kent.
I asked them to do this. I feel responsible.
no, you are not responsible.
I can't believe that we were enjoying dinner while this was happening.
Dr. Nolan, I know this hard, but we are going to need your help.
organized, controlled, chose random victims, fearless.
because he took out two police-department employees at a symposium for serial killers.
although until there's a third murder, technically, he's not a serial killer.
the theatrical staging indicates he wants to play.
with us. - Which means this will escalate.
you think there'll be more? - I do, yeah.
the burns are significant.
none of Hoyt's apprentices ever added their own signatures.
trace evidence is doing a complete work-up on the bodies.
I won't be able to do the autopsies till tomorrow, but I'll be able to tell you more about the burns then.
uh, we can wait downstairs if you're not finished.
is it all right if I head back to the hotel?
of course, yes. Thank you so much for your help.
we went through all the security footage.
there are no cameras monitoring the auditorium.
we're trying to track every person who was on campus at the time of the murders.
that'll be thousands. - Yeah.
I matched credentials for all law enforcement against their registration for the symposium.
everyone's who they said they were. It's 2: 00 A. M. Let's go home.
all right.
you can stay with me tonight. - No. I'm fine.
it's not him, Maura. - I know, but it's still stressful.
I want to go home, take a bath, and pet my dog.
I got to check on Kojak. She had puppies.
Kojak had a sex change? - Ha ha ha.
can we meet back here in six hours?
Hey, Jo. Hi.
you'd be barking like crazy if somebody was in here, right?
you can't wag your tail and make friends if it's a bad guy, okay?
okay, Jo. I'm overreacting, right?
come here, sweetie.
on days like today, I think I'd like to be you.
Hello, Jane.
I'm sorry to have to wake you.
you looking for this?
come in.
I wanted you to meet Theo. Yeah.
did I ever tell you how I learned to kill? Hmm?
my first pup was named Rascal.
you remember what we talked about, right?
I still remember that first time, when I could feel Rascal's pulse as the blood was pumping.
you know what I did, Jane, right?
you can't ... no.
No!
Hey, Jo. Jo, come here.
sorry, sweetie. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Maura, somebody's at the door.
it's Jane. She just called.
Hi.
thank you. - Yeah. It's okay.
Hey, Ma.
I just had the worst nightmare.
Oh. What was it about? - Rather not say.
okay. Sit. You want some eggs?
no, just ... just coffee, please.
okay. - Thanks, Ma.
okay. I want to know if I have PTSD.
I don't know. I'm not an expert. - But you've thought it.
anybody who's gone through the trauma you've gone through with Hoyt would likely suffer from post-traumatic stress.
I just thought these nightmares would have stopped by now.
at least 75% of people suffering from post-traumatic stress do have nightmares.
so I have it? - No, I didn't say that.
can you just forget about it?
well, actually, no. No, don't forget about it.
there is something called imagery rehearsal therapy.
you replay the dream, Jane, but you change the way it ends.
okay. I can do that. It's just so real.
it was like it meant some... Do you think it meant something?
the science behind dreams isn't well-established.
Maura, I just want your opinion. It doesn't have to be peer-reviewed.
themes and patterns in dreams may be telling you something your frontal cortices ignore when you're awake.
take a sick day.
have Sergeant Korsak and Detective Frost handle it.
please, baby, stop.
come on. Look at you.
you know I can't do that, Ma.
trace evidence didn't find anything on the duct tape, the clothing, or the body.
that's too bad.
you see the pattern in the burn? - Yeah.
well, there's a similar pattern in the male victim's burn.
so you think the killer used the same object to brand them?
possibly. I'm taking an impression of both burns.
I'll have Frost run a description of both burns through the VICAP database.
but I'm not holding out hope.
we're gonna get a hit on anyone that's ever been burned with a cigarette.
anything? - Not yet. It's still drying.
hoping to get a negative of a negative. - A who?
well, a burn is a negative impression, so a latex is a ...
Negative-negative. Got it. Okay, skip to the part where you tell me what it was that burned them.
you know, I think it's healthy that you've begun to process your trauma.
I knew I opened a can of PTSD worms today. What...
can we just not talk about it, please? - No, your reaction is normal.
okay. Have you talked to Dr. Nolan today?
Yes. She thinks that we should have all of the symposium's participants do a personality test.
all cops have taken it. I've taken it.
Yeah. Me too. It's a requirement to get your license renewed.
and if the killer is law enforcement, he'd have taken it, which means he'll know what we're trying to do and try to beat the test.
Yes. But I plan on comparing our results to the ones on file.
Oh, good idea. - Mm-Hmm.
neither impression is very clear. - So, four negatives.
bummer.
CSRU didn't find anything at the crime scene.
nothing? No hair, no fingerprints?
no saliva, no blood, not a damn thing. Not even a footprint.
no one is this good the first time out.
stupid friggin' way to try to solve a double homicide.
how many have you collected?
59. But everyone on the list signed in. We should get all 120.
and you've been confirming identification? Yes. They've been showing me photo I. D.s.
I've got better things to do. You'd think they do, too.
if anyone gives you a hard time, let me know.
Oh, I can handle these guys.
why would the killer re-create the Yeager murders?
that question kept me up all night.
there are different categories of serial killers.
this one seems to fall into either thrill killer or power-seeker killer.
if I fail your test, am I a thrill man or a power man?
thank you, Detective Fletcher.
you know, in Pittsburgh, we wouldn't be farting around giving personality tests to cops.
we'd have them help, probably even have an arrest by now.
thank you for your input. - Any time.
take my card. You call me when you're ready to solve this.
grandiosity is the hallmark of psychopathy.
I can't wait to score Detective Fletcher's test.
we've identified these three ... Detective Mike Clemens, from Omaha,
detective Reggie Jones, from New York, and this one ... Detective Chuck Fletcher, from Pittsburgh.
all show the signs of evasiveness, inconclusive responses, and defensiveness.
they tried to beat the test? - We think so.
we compared our tests to tests their departments had on file.
so trying to beat it got them caught.
we noted high scores for ego and hostility in all three of these, along with an absence of empathy.
they're psychopaths. - Or sociopaths.
I'd need to do some more testing. It's enough to round them up and interview them.
did Detective Frost get anything on the VICAP search when he ran the burns?
over a thousand hits. Not much help.
Jane okay? - Yeah. Are you?
Yeah. You know all our stories.
you've probably read my statements.
Yes, I did. This must be very difficult for you, too.
you once rescued Detective Rizzoli from Charles Hoyt.
I did. Worst night of my life.
wish I'd killed the son of a bitch.
okay, thanks.
clemens and Jones are in a seminar at the symposium.
Chuck Fletcher didn't sign in. You look at Fletcher's file?
Yeah, got it right here. He's a 15-Year veteran with a lot of black marks on his record.
45 complaints for use of excessive force? That's a lot.
got passed over for a promotion recently.
disciplined for drinking on the job...
serial killers are often substance abusers.
we got to find Chuck Fletcher.
sergeant Korsak.
okay, we're on it. Get Jane.
they found a body at the BCU campus.
is that dumpster emptied on a regular schedule?
I'll find out. Why?
I'm just thinking whoever dumped that body was looking for maximum impact.
killer knew once that dumpster was moved, everybody's gonna get a good show.
dead guy's a cop. - What?
guess we can rule out Chuck Fletcher. - You're right, Jane.
dumpster gets emptied at 10: 05, right as classes let out.
all right, come on. Let's take a look at the body.
stabbed. One wound under the solar plexus.
and look at his wrist. - That's the same burn.
so somebody lured him here. That's why his gun's still in the holster.
Yeah. Either he knew his killer or he wasn't afraid of him.
both ears were severed, and the damage to his eyes appears to have been inflicted post-mortem.
see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.
Oh, god. - What is it?
the second killer that Dr. Nolan profiled ...
that's what he did to his victims.
you think the serial killer is working his way through my book?
I don't know.
but this could be directed at me? - I'm not a Detective...
I don't have any family, and no one has threatened me.
all three of our victims had ties to law enforcement and the symposium.
but what do you make of the copycat aspect?
serial killers like to play out their own individual fantasies.
exactly. So why play out someone else's fantasy?
with the exception of the burn, our killer is just re-creating murders.
perhaps he's saying, "you solved this the first time, but you won't solve it a second time."
he's certainly giving us a challenge.
the third killer in your book is David James Johnson.
could that be next?
he looks like the perfect family man.
doesn't he? He used to chain his victims to a wall.
drive knives, nails, or scalpels through their hands and feet, usually while they were still alive.
4% of the population is either a sociopath or a psychopath.
well, luckily, they're not all serial killers.
and I do think law enforcement serves as a deterrent.
unlikely. Serial killers are impulsive by nature, fearless of consequences.
Jane, it's me! - Why are you yelling?!
I didn't want to scare you.
what are you doing here? - Spending the night.
what ... no, Frankie. I don't remember inviting you.
some whack-job has taken out three cops in the last 24 hours.
I'm not sleeping alone tonight. Neither are you.
well, I'm not sleeping with you.
come on.
if something happened to you, I couldn't forgive myself.
nothing's gonna happen to me.
please, get yourself a beer. - Thanks. I got one.
Jane, it's just me!
I got some food. - Hi, Ma.
Hi. Hey, Frankie. - Hey, Ma.
so, let me guess ...
you're here to make sure the boogeyman doesn't get me?
Yes. That's what mothers are for.
so, who wants some lasagna?
but we could start with some... chocolate!
Hey! - Hey!
you always get it first! - I want the hearts.
Frankie ... fine. I will give you the hearts.
I'm taking an impression of his burn.
let's hope it's a better negative-negative this time.
let's not anticipate results, but I think it might be.
I see something.
looks like snakes on a stick. Are those wings?
I think it could be the Rod of Asclepius,
which often gets confused with the Caduceus.
who would get confused?
well... the Caduceus is two snakes entwined around the magic wand of Hermes, topped by wings.
right. Who doesn't know that? - You'd be surprised.
and Asclepius was an ancient Greek physician, and that symbol is one snake, encircling a staff.
the medical symbol? - Yes.
do you think June and Kent were burned by the same thing that made this mark on Chuck Fletcher?
I think they were all burned by an object that is approximately 1. 9 by 1. 5 centimeters.
that's his signature.
let's run it through VICAP.
six hits with burns that sort of look like the ones on our victims.
Maura, was the same object used to brand them?
the burns look similar, but the images just aren't good.
I can't be sure. - First murder was in 1988.
there wasn't another murder with that burn until 1999.
why stop for 11 years? - Killer could've been incarcerated.
many serial killers stop for long periods.
frost, can you pull up the case file on the first murder?
it's a double murder ... a prominent Cleveland pediatrician and his wife.
Dr. Sheppard Appleton and his wife, Susan, were shot to death in a home invasion.
and their daughter survived by hiding in a closet.
so the first victims weren't law enforcement.
what about the other four murders? - No ties to cops. All random people.
what else do we know about that double murder?
doctor was shot twice in the chest while watching TV.
wife was hit in the abdomen, crawled, shot another five times at point-blank range.
can you say "overkill"? So these may or may not be related.
if they are related, then our killer went from guns to copycat serial murders.
well, it's not unheard of in the research for a serial killer to change his M. O.
Jane, what if none of these six unsolved murders have anything to do with our three?
then we're back to square one.
are you sure you don't want something?
I know it's a police station, but the food is good.
no, I'm good. Thanks.
I had Jack burn DVDs of all my interviews.
thank you, Jack. - I'll meet you outside.
I hope it helps. I can't imagine how, but you're welcome to go through them.
did any of these three men ever mention communicating with anyone on the outside?
I don't think so. But I do know that they all got fan mail.
explain that one to me. You got any copies of those?
no, I'm sorry.
I'm a simple guy. I don't care why. Just want to stop them.
I had a thought about how Detective Fletcher might have been lured behind that dumpster.
Really? - Well, I want to confirm it first.
but I can take a look at the area on my way to the next seminar at 4: 00.
I'd like to go there with you.
dog alarm. Got a new litter of pups.
mom won't leave them.
luckily, I live close by. I could meet you there.
well, why don't I send Jack ahead to get my powerpoint presentation ready?
and we could swing by your place and then take a look at the dumpster.
I don't want to slow you down. - My dog died right before my book tour.
it would be so good to just pet an animal today.
well, come on, then.
Hey, Frankie, can you take these DVDs upstairs?
sure.
you on puppy watch? - Yeah.
any instructions? - Jane and Frost know what to look for.
so, what we're looking for is any mention of someone on the outside. - Okay.
Oh, Jane, let me listen to the Hoyt interviews.
that's okay. I got it.
so, please talk to me about your family history.
I'd like to know the details of the first time that you killed a living thing.
so, can we go back for a second and talk me through that first murder again?
I'd like to ask you about Detective Rizzoli.
well, I love to talk about Detective Rizzoli.
don't be jealous.
we have a special relationship, too, Victoria.
tell me why you like her so much.
I love your neck. It's so beautiful.
and your breasts...
very firm.
tell me, Jane ... what would you like to do to me?
I'd like to get my gun... - Mm-Hmm.
and put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.
okay?
guns are so impersonal. We're trained doctors, Victoria.
so was Sheppard. "Sheppard"?
just think ... think how exquisite it would've been to feel Sheppard's pulse as the blood drained out.
and Susan's, too, as she crawled...
Hoyt knew about the double murders in Cleveland.
what?
you think Hoyt did it? - No. There ...
there's no way he could have. He was training at fort Stewart.
those murders are the key.
are those all the photos? - Oh. Just got one more.
Oh, my god. Push in on his left wrist.
you see his cufflink?
the medical symbol. That has to be it, Maura.
it's the right size, and it would make a similar impression.
Where's the other cufflink? Frost, push in on his right wrist.
it's not there.
spearmint okay? - Sounds delicious.
Oh. Who do we have here?
the dark one is Starsky, and the little white one is Hutch.
they're rescues.
you're not married? - No.
three wives, not one of them ever looked at me the way my dogs do.
they think I'm the greatest man who ever lived.
always glad to see me, aren't you, fellas?
mom's hungry.
nursing takes a lot of calories. Come on.
the daughter, Tory, was taken to a local hospital and treated for shock.
we should find her and talk to her.
she says in her statement to police she never saw the killer.
well, maybe she did and was too scared to say.
she'd recently given birth.
who? The wife? - The 14-year-old.
that's what the medical exams revealed. Well, she didn't mention it to the police.
no. There are no hospital records of her giving birth.
well, her father was a pediatrician. Maybe it was a home birth?
was she ever treated for broken bones?
Yes. Uh, more than once.
but no reports of abuse? - No.
check to see if Dr. Appleton had privileges at the hospital where Tory was treated.
he did.
so everyone who cared for his daughter worked for him.
that's why no one reported the abuse.
I think you might be right, Charles.
knives and scalpels might be more satisfying.
perhaps because it was my first time.
I was still conflicted. - You needed some distance, yes.
big risk, giving us that interview.
hardly. Your colleagues won't be able to put my complicated puzzle together.
you killed your parents. And started again 11 years later?
in medical school? - Yes.
after I read about unsolved murders that turned out to be the work of Charles Hoyt.
so organized, controlled, meticulous.
why me? - You're a "simple guy."
you come home every day at 3: 30 to feed your nursing dog.
I'll get Jack started, and I'll still make it to the symposium by 4: 00.
with my alibi and one for Jack, too, no one will question me.
do you think of yourself as part of the system, Sergeant?
I don't know what you're asking me.
have you ever interviewed a teenage girl?
many times. - And what would you do if that girl ...
who is... 14, let's say ...
told you that she had been repeatedly raped by her prominent father?
I'd arrest him.
liar! You would hide behind the system.
my mother hid behind her perfect home and her respectable husband ...
Dr. Appleton, pillar of the community.
do you know how they explained my son to people?
Oh, I already know the story. Please. I like hearing it.
tell me.
they said he'd been abandoned at my father's office, - and they put him up for adoption. - I'm sorry.
Yeah.
hello.
do you know that you can desensitize a child by having him practice violent behavior?
makes sense. Is that what you did to Jack?
when I finally found him, yes.
remember when you were 5... and I taught you how to kill a puppy?
Yeah, mom.
I do. - Don't.
we're not here for the puppy.
we're here for you.
OK, thank you.
that 14-year-old girl who witnessed her parents' double murder went into foster care.
why do you look so ominous? - Because she changed her name - from Tory Appleton to Victoria Nolan. - Oh, my god.
it's Dr. Nolan? - Yeah.
how? I... She was with us when the murders occurred.
she has a partner.
68% of female serial killers kill in teams.
where did you get that from?
her introduction. - Where is she right now?
uh, she's gonna be at the symposium in 30 minutes.
Korsak's not back yet? - Yeah, where is he?
he's taking his sweet time today.
maybe he's getting a little more than puppy love.
what do you mean?
what? He and Dr. Nolan went back to his house to feed his dog.
Jack, use the carbon-steel scalpel. - All right.
you trained him well. - Haven't I?
I let him do the last three on his own.
how many have you done together? - Not enough.
tell him what we have planned. - Charles Hoyt preferred to go between the palmar interosseous bones.
like he did with Jane.
but David felt it was more painful to split the ulna and the radius bones.
don't make your son do this.
I don't make him do it. He enjoys it.
Oh, I do.
I have so many good memories of doing this with my mom.
this isn't random. This is personal.
Yes, it is. I hold you responsible for what happened to Charles.
a little help down here!
you cut his work short. He had so much left to do.
it's time. Jack, give me his gun.
Charles taught me guns ruin the experience.
how many?
murders? Oh, it's crass to count.
we don't brand them all. It'd make it too easy.
but we'll brand you. Not yet.
take the scalpel. - Yes, I know the sequence.
carbon steel...
why do you let her tell you what to do?
she doesn't tell me what to do.
stop wasting time, Jack. - Sorry, mom.
and here I thought you were doing this all by yourself.
obviously. You've been at the crime scenes. You've seen my work.
no. What I've seen is your mother telling you what to do.
his hands, Jack, now.
all right! - How old are you? 25?
you let your mother tell you what to do? - Finish it!
Yeah, I'd never put up with that.
shut up! - You telling me or you telling her?!
I said finish it! - Shut up!
now look what you made me do!
don't move, you piece of crap.
call an ambulance. - You okay?
not for me, for them. There's bolt cutters in that tool bag.
Yeah, I need E. M.S. at 6424 Dorchester Avenue.
Oh, let him die. He's always reminded me of my father.
make her walk, Frost. - Come on.
you sure you're okay? - Yeah.
I am glad to see you, though. - Well, I always did want to rescue you.
come on.
Oh. Pretty cold, huh?
her telling us to let her son die.
psychopaths are incapable of forming relationships.
poor kid.
that "poor kid" hit you in the head with a 2x4.
he was gonna drive a scalpel through you.
I'd have shot him through the nuts, if they'd hurt my dogs.
well I really like your porch, Sergeant. It must be nice to have a porch.
Yeah, you can check out your neighbours.
got any cute ones? - Yeah, three sisters live next door.
your age or our age? - Go knock, check for yourself.
it's nice to finally see your house Vincent.
it's nice to having you. Next time bring some food.
yeah...
we're rushing over this time. - Yeah, ok, that was good thinking.
Cheers. - Thanks.
back off, Merton. Back off.
Shh! Quiet!
do you want the neighbors to complain again?
it doesn't get any better than this, does it, Merton?
Yes! Done!
every follow-up report. What's my prize?
two days off to hang with your boyfriend. Mm! First days I've taken in a year.
bpd owes me 116. - That's nothing. They owe me 243.
why are you two competing over who takes the fewest vacation days?
because we're studs. - Ahh!
so what do you and Casey have planned?
well, he's only on leave for 72 hours, so nothing.
he sent seven letters in the last five days.
he's bored. He'll get a new prison pen pal eventually.
I'm curious. For all I know, Paddy could be confessing to another crime.
Oh, I'm sure that's it.
they're releasing him. - They're what?
they can't. He's awaiting trial for the murder of Cavanaugh's wife and baby son.
no, I-I don't mean Paddy. His father ... Patrick Sr.
Paddy's father's still alive? - Yeah, he's the first Boston mob boss to ever to go down for R. I.C. O.
he's been locked up for ... what? ... 30 years.
31. - What? Let me see this.
of all the people guilt-tripping ...He wants you to take in his father.
didn't Patrick Sr. threaten to kill Hope when he found out Paddy got her pregnant?
Yes. He did. And who was Hope pregnant with?
I can't really remember... Oh, yeah! You, Maura!
the parole is conditional. They'll revoke it if he doesn't have a place to live by tomorrow.
paddy says he won't last much longer in prison. Well, is it bad form to say, "yay"?
he's on a waiting list for public housing. It might just be a few days.
I could at least put him up in a hotel. - No, you can't.
he has to have a permanent address.
Dr. Isles. - Rizzoli.
Yes. - Okay.
all right.
all right, we got it. We got a floater in a hot tub.
first responders aren't sure if it was an accidental drowning.
please, please don't let this mess up my plans with Casey, please!
you want me and Korsak to take it? What the hell is that, Frost?
I put "shot alert" on my computer to track city shootings myself.
okay, here we go. Moss Hill gym and Racquet Club.
dispatch.
looks like we got a victim there. You take that.
Jane and I will take the floater. - Then who's helping me?
Martinez got you on anything? - No. What do you need.
there's your help.
well, at least she was having a good time. Wine, weed, and cheese doodles.
Oh, there was a boom box in there with her. She was electrocuted.
I can't be certain of cause of death until I dissect her lungs.
she seems to have a significant amount of adipose tissue.
and this sheen appears to be glycerol.
body fat and lotion. That would slow down conductivity.
Yeah, boom box was pushed into the hot tub.
we got ourselves a murder. - Pink froth around her lips and nose.
you have a tell when your head's not in the game.
I don't know what you mean.
pink froth"?
not "cytoplastics hematoma liquidity at a cellular level"?
no.
you still ruminating over your messed-up family? Paddy Doyle isn't my family.
but he is part of my genetic makeup, as is my grandfather, and I want to meet him.
Oh, so now you're Heidi, and you're gonna climb the Alps with gramps and feed the goats?
pink froth is a result of hemolysis due to rupture of red blood cells and the release of cytoplasm into surrounding fluid.
so she inhaled water. You see anything that suggests she was held under?
I see some bruising on her shoulders, yes.
Hey. - Hi.
that's the friend who found the body. The victim is Rhonda Clark.
she's a Professor in the sociology department at B. C.U.
the ladies had a weekly date in the hot tub.
Yeah, with Mr. Chardonnay and Mrs. Cannabis.
Yeah, I sent officers to B. C.U. to get the husband.
he's a sociology Professor, too. - Okay.
Hey, Merton! Here, boy! - Robert Merton was a famous sociologist.
he developed the concept of unintended consequences.
can you make him stop? - Watch this. Hey.
here, Merton. Here, boy.
good dog!
quiet!
nice try, dog whisperer. Can you put him back in the house?
wait, Korsak, did we get any complaints tonight from the neighbors about a dog barking?
I can ask. Why? - Well, he's a barker.
if he's not barking his head off when his master's getting murdered - then that means he knows the killer. - Good thinking.
Hey, Frost, what do you got? Sweet ride.
you never see this color. It's called "beluga black."
I meant the victim.
Oh, uh, sorry. Sorry. Mark Cabot, 37.
he was the very wealthy head of Annisquam Investments.
the Cabots are an old family ... Boston brahmins. He's a member of this club.
parks his expensive car by itself in the "platinum circle."
witnesses? - None, and the security cameras were in the process of being upgraded.
that's convenient. Robbery?
as his wallet and very nice watch are still here, so I don't think so.
we'll process the scene and wait for Dr. Lsles. I'll be there as soon as I can.
okay, Frankie, you got to do the notifications.
me? - He's married.
his wife and his sister worked with him.
I called the company. They're still at work.
it's an awful part of the job, but you got to get used to it, okay?
you can do it. - Okay.
Merton is quite the barker. We got a long list of complaints, but none tonight.
and the dog wasn't barking on the 911 call.
that's interesting. - Nothing seems disturbed upstairs.
this must be the husband.
I wonder where he was tonight.
I told her so many times to be careful in the hot tub.
this is tragic. Just as she was about to get everything she wanted.
what was that? - Tenure.
we were that ... that lucky academic couple.
what do you mean, because you worked at the same university?
that never happens, especially not with a liberal-arts subject like sociology. It's so competitive.
did you have tenure?
Why? - It must have been difficult being married to someone who was about to have tenure before you. She deserved it.
can you tell us where you were this evening? - Why?
my wife drowned, didn't she? - She was murdered.
where were you? - Just what the hell are you asking me?
okay, I loved my wife, all right?
we ... we were partners. We did everything together.
where were you? - With my students.
okay, my office hours are from 5: 00 to 9: 00 PM. You can ask them.
you know what? Better yet, why don't you ask big brother?
NSA isn't the only agency that's watching us. I got a parking fob, I got a building pass.
this is my ATM card. You check my digital footprint if you don't believe me.
that's a good idea. I think I'll do that now.
the older one's the sister.
that's the wife. God, how do I do this?
you just got to do it.
maybe I'll stay in drug unit. If I can look at dead bodies, you can do this.
can I help you? I'm Detective Frank Rizzoli, Boston homicide.
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but ...
Boston homicide? - God, it's not ...
please, no. - Jenny, it isn't ... it isn't Mark.
I'm afraid it is. - What?
we found his body. - What?
I'm so very, very sorry. - Oh, my god.
got it, Jane. Thanks. That was my partner.
big brother just gave you the thumbs-up.
she'll meet you downstairs with your card and keys.
I told you. - Apologies for the tough questions.
look, all that matters now is that you find out who did this to Rhonda.
we think your dog might have known the killer.
how well would Merton have to know someone before he'd stop barking? - Really well.
how many people did he know that well? - A lot of people.
Rhonda had office hours at home, so there were students there all the time, and faculty, and she had a lot of friends.
I'll call you if we have anything. - Thank you.
excuse me. - Excuse me.
Hey, uh, the victim's wife and sister asked me if they could have a Sergeant with them in the interview room.
did Frankie screw up the notification?
no, but they sensed how green he is. - We sure they're not suspects?
positive. I checked their parking cards.
they never left the building's garage. - In their cars, anyway.
I checked the office's online server, too. They were both logged in when he was gunned down.
okay. Come on. Let's talk to them.
we need to ask both of you if Mark had any enemies.
you'll find this out soon enough.
my brother was an acquired taste.
he was a really wonderful human being... if he liked you.
but... he wouldn't win any popularity contests.
he headed up a leading arbitrage company.
you don't make friends buying companies to tear them apart.
competitors called him "darth raider."
I mean, to his face. He was really funny about it.
he'd just... smile.
I think I'm hearing you say he had a long list of enemies.
it shouldn't matter what people thought of Mark.
business acumen and arrogance shouldn't get you killed!
it shouldn't, but it might have. We need a list of anyone you think might be responsible.
okay. We can do that.
we'll also need all former and current clients ... anyone that Mark did business with.
Yeah, Leslie handles all that.
Yeah, it's a family-owned company. I'll give you everything.
initial tox screen confirmed she had a 0, 01 blood alcohol level, and a high level of cannabis in her system.
Oh, well, add electricity to that, and she wouldn't be hard to hold underwater.
Oh, put him over here on the table. - Is that the shooting victim?
Yes. He was shot at close range. The bullet's still lodged in the skull.
how did Frankie do at the scene?
good. Very composed. But he had a good teacher.
Oh, I need Frost's magic fingers.
wait. Okay, here we go.
Rhonda and Rick Clark were both experts in anomie, whatever that is.
the study of social instability ...
environment has a significant effect on genetic expression.
one more reason to be thankful that Paddy Doyle didn't raise you.
so, she was about to get tenure, and he wasn't.
well, that will put a strain on a marriage of academics.
Sayre's law ... the politics of a university are so intense because the stakes are so low.
seems so surprising that even smart people can't get it together.
why is that surprising?
I just can't understand why you would even lift a finger to help him.
well, I... I could say it's the compassionate physician in me.
but the truth is, I'll never not be Paddy Doyle's daughter.
I just want to know where he came from.
Why? - Why does anybody trace their heritage?
you didn't get the bullet out yet? - Yeah, Maura. Come on.
the body's been here at least 30 seconds.
Oh. Sorry.
so what should I do while I wait for ballistics?
Korsak said the wife and sister gave you a list of enemies.
and a long one.
the gym managers high-fived when we told them who the victim was.
sounds like the whole place wanted this guy dead.
get this ... when he lost a squash match, he peed in his opponent's locker.
wait. He urinated in it? - That is what "peed" means, yes.
his tires were slashed multiple times. Car was keyed.
any idea who did it? - No idea.
that's why they were setting up the new security cameras.
mark Cabot demanded it. - Okay, so start with the gym members.
find out who's a registered gun owner.
great. Thanks, Jane. - Yep.
are you looking through my personal files?
well, if you don't want anyone looking, don't label them "personal."
"personal" ... related to a person's private affairs. You got Patrick Sr.'s medical records?
congestive heart failure, arthritis, emphysema...
this man needs assisted living. Maura, you can't take this on.
it's temporary, Jane.
I think you're nuts.
I got a delivery now?
you got a delivery?
what are you doing here?
you're a day early.
okay. I can come back. - No! Get over here.
Mm. No, I'm ... I'm at work. - I don't care.
there you are.
why didn't you wake me? - I didn't want you in my way.
Wow. You cook, too?
where did you get the eggs and all the vegetables?
farmers' market. - Really?
you're like a 17th-century wife. - Is that good or bad?
well, it's fantastic. I've always wanted a wife.
what do you want to do today?
watch me churn butter or help me beat the dust from the rugs?
Oh, Casey, I have to go to work. - Oh, my bad. I showed up early.
well, I know. I just ... I ... what happened in my fridge?
it met a bucket of soapy water and a sponge. Did ... did you throw the orange juice out?
it was empty. I tossed it.
what ... no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't throw the ketchup out.
Jane, you make enough money to eat food that didn't expire in 2007.
you were growing things in there. - And you did the laundry.
never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
well, I just ... I feel guilty.
well, I was hoping you'd feel loved.
Yeah. - Hmm.
I do feel loved?
you do? - Mm-hmm.
do you? - Yes, I really feel loved.
Mm. - Morning!
good morning, Ma!
okay, well, don't let me interrupt... Charles.
someday, I'm gonna make you call me "Casey."
look, I know you two are grown-up, but I still don't approve.
Oh, really? This coming from the woman who's canoodling with my boss.
Jane, for heaven's sake, what's wrong with you? What are you doing here?
your brothers are slobs, and I needed a place to stay.
is that...
fresh garlic and sea salt ... you want some?
Yes. - Wait. Do not encourage ...
wait. - What?
did Maura kick you out so she could move in grandpa Patrick?
she said she needed the guest house for somebody who couldn't climb stairs.
who's Patrick? It's good.
Patrick Doyle, Sr. - Paddy's father?
Mm-hmm. - She gave my guest house to a criminal?
it's not exactly "your" guest house, Ma.
well, I certainly don't want to stay with him, nor do I want to stay where I am not wanted.
Really? That's good news.
unless it's with family. - Hmm.
excuse me. - Are you sure, Ma?
because, you know, me and my lover are going to be doing lots of things that you don't approve of.
go ahead. - Wait. But, Ma, look.
you could get some tips for you and Cavanaugh.
Oh, for crying out loud, Jane! That's disgusting.
no, come on. I was kidding. Where are you going? Ma, come on.
I'm gonna go to Maura's spare bedroom.
what about Patrick Doyle? - Well, if he can stand it, so can I.
if you make her an honest woman,
I'll call you anything you want, Charles.
goodbye, Jane. - Bye, Ma.
did you get Frankie's bullet out?
Yes. And your mother hates me.
no. She loves your guest house. And you, too.
she hardly said one word to me. Well, enjoy the silence for a while.
she'll be fine, unless Patrick puts a hit out on her.
too soon? - You have a tell, too.
and what is my tell?
your jokes get a little edge when something's bothering you.
it's Casey? - I can't take my day off to be with him because I have yet another homicide to solve.
that is a lie.
I could have totally taken a day off today, and I didn't.
you want to know why? - Yes, I do know why.
because you love solving homicides. You love your work.
Yeah, and... I can't tell him that. I feel guilty.
besides, the guy's been in town 10 hours ... he's already washed my underwear.
my thongs, Maura.
that's awkward. - Yeah, tell me about it.
and he cleaned out my refrigerator. - Now, that, I approve of.
there are alternaria spores and maybe even rhizopus on your pastrami.
Jane, this isn't about Casey. It's about you.
Yeah, it is.
I can't be me and be his, too.
so, tell him. - How do people make this work?
I mean, I love him. I want him to stay.
and I want him to go. - Those are mutually exclusive desires.
Yes, this much I know, Maura.
hmm, look what I'm seeing in the mucosa of the primary bronchi.
Oh, thank god for mucosa.
a hair.
it's a canis lupus hair. - A dog. She had a dog.
Yeah, but it's not Merton's. It's not from a labradoodle.
maybe our killer had a dog, too.
Hi, how many students had office hours with Rhonda at her home?
just about to head over to B. C.U. to get a list of everybody ... we can ask.
okay. We need to find out how many of them own dogs.
Hey, I've been going through all of Mark Cabot's business dealings ...
customers, vendors, clients. So far, no one stands out.
what's the matter? - Oh, I was hoping you had something.
no hits on the bullet Maura recovered from Mark Cabot's body.
well, don't get discouraged. I've solved a lot of cases without ballistics.
what else you got? - Nothing.
except they don't make bigger douche bags than Mark Cabot. What about the other gym members with the gun licenses?
49 gym members have guns. - That's a hell of a lot of guns.
we should check 'em all.
the dean of the sociology department has that list prepared.
let's go. - Okay.
they're releasing him in two hours. I can't face him alone.
I can go to B. C.U. alone.
Maura can't go to Souza-Baranowski prison alone. Go, Jane.
Oh... the things I do for you.
sign there, there, and there. - Thank you.
you have to sign for his wheelchair?
well, it's government issued. He'll have to give it back.
Oh, yeah, 'cause you're really tempted to steal a used wheelchair.
there are prisoners here in their 90s, Jane. Well, this guy's a spring chicken.
that's my grandfather.
Hello, Mr. Doyle. I'm ... - I know who you are.
you look like that, uh... that woman, that, uh... that Hope.
she's my biological mother. I'm Dr. Maura Isles.
"Biological." Put a lot of stock in that, do you?
biology?
you gonna tell me that you're, uh, Paddy's daughter 'cause my son knocked up some college girl?
you should have never seen the light of day.
put him back, Maura.
your girlfriend's right. Listen, sweetheart.
leave me here. I like it here.
I don't want anything to do with you.
great. Sit here and rot. Maura, let's go.
Oh, no, you don't. - Oh, yes, we do.
you signed the paperwork.
Patrick Doyle's not our problem anymore. He's all yours.
I'm warning you. Don't push me where I don't want to go.
you don't got a choice. - This is just temporary. As I told you, you'll be in assisted living in just a few days, Mr. Doyle.
and as I told you, take me back to my cell, and don't you call me "Mr. Doyle."
what should she call you? Number 2492?
I said, take me back.
Hey, you heard the man! You're our problem now!
until I can give you back to the state.
I can see where Paddy got all of his lovely traits.
come on. We got to get back to work. Jane.
he is a hideous human being, but I can't just leave him here alone.
take me to Southie.
that's great idea. We could dump him at 8th.
I got plenty of friends in Southie.
Oh, yeah? Like who, huh?
Mikey Kelly? Big Murph? Huh?
duba Shaughnessy? They're all dead, Patrick!
don't you call me Patrick, lady.
No! No! Damm it!
I know. I know. I'm coming back soon.
you said you'd be here an hour ago. I've got all of Rhonda's files here.
let's close this sucker and get you off to canoodle.
who's barking?
Elsie. - Hey, Sergeant.
uh, is ... is Casey there? - Yeah. Jane.
Hey, babe. How come you're not at work?
it's a long story. Listen.
um, Elsie was trained to assist soldiers in wheelchairs, right?
Yeah, why? - I need a favor.
okay, that's enough, now. Huh?
you're beginning to bug me a bit, huh?
good girl. Yeah, you're a big girl. - Don't read anything into that.
even psychopaths like dogs.
I know. - All right. Okay. All right. That's enough.
but thank you for bringing her. At least he's stopped complaining.
I'll get her comfortable with him, and then we'll try some stuff.
he's like the soldiers with disabilities I see all the time. - Except he's a crook.
might be hard for you to believe, but he's scared.
of me, I Hope. - Scared of change.
see it in the military ... guys used to that life.
some start to think they can't live outside the system.
anyway, you two go back to work. - What? No. You can't stay here.
I want you to go back to work so you get home sooner.
go. I got it. - Thank you.
don't get too friendly. He's not moving in with us.
"us," huh? I like the sound of that.
how do we get Patrick out of Maura's house?
I know a guy in the housing authority.
Really? You could pull a fix? - Not a "fix." A favor.
just get him off the wait list and out of your hair.
okay, yeah. Don't tell Maura, but do it.
what did you get at B. C.U? - I spoke to the dean.
professor Rhonda Clark had a stellar reputation.
I brought her files and her personal belongings from her office.
Wow! Is that Rhonda? - Yeah. Hard to believe, huh?
what do we blame ... the weed or the crunchy snacks?
any of her students stand out? - Yeah, this one. Peter Kaufman.
he was actually Rick's student, but it was up to Rhonda to decide whether to let Peter into their PHD program.
And? - And according to the dean,
Rhonda washed him out. Peter didn't take it well.
she recorded his final oral presentation.
if this has anything to do with gruel for Patrick or where to hide the good silver, - I'm trying to catch up. - It's about dog hair.
Oh! Did you find the breed? - Yes. It's a German shepherd.
high levels of dander, which explains the mucosal edema I found in the lung tissue samples.
she was allergic? But she had a dog.
Merton was labradoodle. No dander.
but if she had a histamine reaction, doesn't that mean that she inhaled the hair?
Yes. - And since she was still breathing, the hair wasn't in the water.
it means the hair could have been on the killer. Maybe the killer had a German shepherd.
the root ball's still intact. I could test the dog hair.
find out if the dog was on any medication.
that might help us identify it. - I'll see what I can do.
let's look at this student, Peter. He had motive. Maybe he had a German shepherd.
Peter's giving his oral presentation. Guess it's like an audition to get into the PHD program.
sorry, Peter. I have to stop you.
I've listened to your presentation with grave concerns.
where is this material from? - That's Professor Rhonda.
my own research, Professor.
I have reason to suspect this is plagiarized. - No, it isn't.
I suspect your logistic regression analysis is also based on someone else's research.
plagiarism is cause for immediate expulsion.
you can't just sit there and accuse me of plagiarism, you fat bitch.
Hey, Peter! That is enough!
no. No! - You will not be continuing in this program.
you need to leave right! - You can't do this to me!
you understand?! - Wow.
Hey, hey, hey! Back off, pal!
that is one angry graduate student. Let's pick him up.
smell that?
weed.
maybe Peter was Rhonda's dealer.
how much do you want?
all of it.
killed her? What are you talking about?
I feel bad that she's dead.
she accused you of plagiarism. - Okay, that pissed me off, and, yeah, maybe I shouldn't have smoked that blend before I gave my presentation.
it makes me kind of paranoid. - Kind of?
listen. She was good people. Way smarter than her husband.
I always wished that she was my adviser, not him.
when we got stoned together ... - You smoked with her?
in the hot tub and at the house.
we'd talk about the mismatch of social mores in capitalist culture, the lack of legitimate aspiration, - the breakdown in social bonds ... - That's all very interesting, Peter.
let's talk about why you attacked your hot-tub buddy when she kicked you out of the program.
you spend four years in college, two years in graduate school, and then, boom, someone says the "p" word, and ... you're out.
that was original work. It's all on this drive.
run it on one of the plagiarism search engines.
where were you last night? - In my apartment with friends.
getting high? - What else do I have to do now?
we're gonna need a list of names to confirm that.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
don't ever apologize for being dedicated to your work.
so... did your grad student have an alibi?
Oh, of course, so that's another dead end. What about the German shepherd?
there are 500 of those dogs in Boston, so ...
wait, no! Why are we talking about my work? No.
did grandpa Patrick make you want to jump on a cargo plane back to Afghanistan?
don't hit me, but I, uh ... I kind of enjoyed being with him.
Ow! I said don't hit me.
well, Korsak found him a spot in public housing, so I can probably can get him moved in a day or two.
he's spent almost half his life in prison.
and you've spent almost half your life in the service.
Yeah. You can get used to anything, even come to depend on it.
Hey, you should congratulate me.
I'm a Colonel. - Oh, my god! Casey! That's ...
Congratulations! Oh, my ... Oh, we need some champagne.
could be I'll never ...
never do anything as well as I do that.
what are you saying?
I'm about to hit 20 years. I have a decision to make, Jane.
well, what kind of decision? - Stay or go.
I'm right where I thought I wanted to be.
Where's that? In line to become a General.
I feel like an anthropologist.
he's actually kind of fascinating. He's very regimented.
he has to eat exactly at 7: 00 A. M.
are you making powdered eggs? - Yes. He likes them overcooked.
do you cut the crusts off his toast, too?
no. Just burn the edges and cut them into squares.
Oh, so no triangles? - Your tell is showing. What's wrong?
Casey. Here I was thinking that he wanted to settle down.
he told me that he had to either accept or decline his orders next month.
what does that mean? - I think it means that he loves the army more than me.
Oh, Jane.
I don't want to talk about this, or I'll never make it through the day.
when do we get the results back on the root ball?
Oh, uh, Susie called this morning.
the German shepherd was on a drug for arthritis ... carprofen.
Oh, my god. It's 6: 58. - Oh, my god.
I told you ... if he doesn't eat exactly at 7: 00, then he's not gonna eat at all.
there he is. Will you give him his breakfast?
what? Why me? - I'm wearing my pyjamas, Jane.
I'm not hungry.
but it's powdered eggs and burnt toast and freezer hash browns.
you eat it, then. - I don't like prison food.
I didn't either. But I got used to it.
so eat your breakfast.
no reason anymore. - There was a reason in prison?
you think I'm some sort of pathetic mobster.
but inside, I'm still somebody in that prison.
well, life has given you another chance to be somebody other than some forgotten mobster.
now eat your damn breakfast and thank Maura for her trouble!
Patrick Jr. was my only son.
I was all he needed...
until that ... that woman, that ... that Hope, came along and ... and changed things, turned him away from me.
Yeah, well, that isn't Maura's fault. It's her fault I'm gonna die out here.
paddy asked her... to take you!
he what? But...
Yeah. He's punishing me.
I wanted to stay where I was. I...
I-I told him, I...
he put me outside...
because...
he wants to see me die...
as a nobody.
maybe he put you out here so you could see the one good thing he's done ...
Bruno. He looks nice. - Mm, yes, he does.
did you just make an online-dating love connection?
funny. I'm pulling up all the registered German shepherds.
I always wanted one ... the good ones are direct and honest, - but not hostile, like you. - Thank you.
I'm sorry I made a joke. Is that my tell?
your what? - What tell?
you have no idea what I'm talking about, do you? Is this a trick question?
I'm so thankful that some of the people I work with are guys.
No! Let's talk dogs, Korsak.
for a guy running a billion-dollar company, this Mark Cabot sure had a lot of time to go to the gym.
you still thinking he was killed by another member?
maybe. He was there every day and on every tournament team.
I asked myself the same question, so I looked through the company's minutes.
mark was never there. Guy was a slacker.
well, maybe somebody on the board wanted him out.
his wife and sister were on the board, right? Yeah, but they both have solid alibis.
and Mark gave everyone motive.
he controlled everything, made all the big decisions, took all the credit.
I found six German shepherds that live within 10 blocks of Rhonda's house.
Jane, there's a dog park near Rhonda's house.
dogs need special tags to use it. I'm pulling up all the German shepherds.
wait a minute. Your VET has to sign off on the forms.
I bet we can find out if any of those dogs were on that drug that we found in the dog hair.
look at that name ... - "Jaco" the German shepherd.
owner is Leslie Cabot.
what the hell? Leslie Cabot is our victim's sister.
it's here in the dog's records.
Leslie Cabot's German shepherd was on carprofen.
I don't get it. These two victims were strangers.
so why is his sister's dog's hair in her lungs?
the murders are connected.
ever see "Strangers on a train"? - Hitchcock.
two strangers each want someone dead.
they agree to do it for each other. - The perfect murders.
you can't set up a perfect murder in today's world without talking to each other.
we can connect them through e-mails or texts or phone calls.
you can check, but I doubt you can find anything.
remember what Rick said to us... "big brother's watching"?
he made sure that we couldn't make a link - between him and Leslie Cabot. - How?
frost, check to see if Rick's dog is registered at Leslie's dog park. - That's it, Jane.
Yeah. Both Merton and Jaco have dog tags and used the park.
that's where they met. That's where they planned the murders.
and they probably agreed never to contact each other unless it was at that dog park.
smart. - Very.
all right, let's talk motive.
why would Leslie want her brother dead? - She got fed up with doing all the work - while he took the credit? - Wait, wait. I found this in the minutes.
it was the one meeting Mark attended.
last week, he had a secret vote to remove a board member.
who was the board member? Who wasn't at that meeting?
you think Leslie figured out that Mark was getting rid of her? What about Rick Clark?
you think he wanted Rhonda dead because she let herself go?
frost, can you do a search?
see if this graduate student plagiarized the material on this drive. - Sure.
what do all university Professors want?
tenure. - That's right.
she got it. He didn't. - You think that's the motive? Jealousy?
okay, this is odd. There it is.
the material on this drive was published in a sociology journal.
so, Peter's thesis was published a week after she kicked him out of the program?
Oh, look who claims he wrote it ... Rick Clark.
that's why Rhonda thought Peter plagiarized it ...
she probably read Rick's article before it was published.
well, tenure is all about publication. So, Rick must have felt the pressure, which means he was competing with his wife for the same tenure slot.
I'll call the dean and find out. Yeah, but we still don't have enough to arrest them.
why not? - We don't have any evidence to connect them to the victims.
Yeah, were there other contenders in line for that tenure slot?
Yes. Yes. All right, thank you.
you were right ... Rick and Rhonda Clark were in line for the same tenure spot.
now that she's dead, it's his, isn't it? The dean's gonna announce it today.
that's motive ... that and the fact that they grew apart.
there has to be a way to get them, Jane.
wait, there is.
let's pit them against each other.
Mr. Clark? Yes, hello. This is Detective Rizzoli.
uh, we've found some security footage from one of your neighbors.
uh, we believe that it's your wife's killer, but we can't identify her.
would you be able to come down and look?
Yes, identify her.
do you see Rick Clark or Leslie Cabot?
not yet. - Thanks for doing this.
you know, you're not supposed to use your personal car for work.
it's new, and I like it, - and would you rather be sitting in a police car? - No.
Hey, Casey, you want to see a movie later? - Sure.
what are you doing? - I'm looking up movie listings.
here, boy. Here, boy.
Hey, Merton. - Hey, buddy.
stay close, Casey. Company.
Hey. - That's not Leslie Cabot.
that's Jenny Cabot ... Mark's wife.
well... Merton knows her. He's not barking.
look at that ... those dogs are friends.
so they met here. Talked dogs, bad marriages.
the police called me. - What?
one of my neighbors got you on their security camera.
what do you mean? They have a recording of me?
they haven't identified you yet. If I'm going down, you're going down, too.
how could you not know your neighbor had a camera Aimed at your damn house?
would you relax, okay? It'll be fine.
Yeah, fine for you, you'll be. I made sure there were no cameras.
hell, I even got you the gun.
which is where? Your house? Your car?
dumbass. - In the ocean.
Oh. What about you, huh? Did you tell your girlfriend you weren't just taking her dog for a walk, huh?
you think Leslie maybe ought to know that you had her brother killed - so that she could save her job. - Don't you dare.
looks like Jenny married the wrong sibling.
wonder if Mark knows his wife was having an affair with his sister.
let's go. - All right.
unless, of course, you want me sending an anonymous letter to your dean.
at least, I didn't have my wife killed so I could take her job.
I hated my wife. - Yeah, well, I hated my husband...
funnily enough, that remains the number-one motive for murder.
we have some good news and some bad news.
the good news is ...
we don't have you on security cameras, Jenny. The bad news ...
you see that dog over there with her collar?
that's a parabolic mike, so we do have you both admitting to murder.
Oh, my god.
you said you wanted to live in Southie. It's a good facility.
just ... just leave me. I'm fine. Leave me.
we'll visit you. - Why?
because it's the right thing to do.
because you're a lonely, angry, old gangster.
but you're also my grandfather, and you don't have anybody else, so take it before I change my mind.
you ... you look just like Paddy right now.
maybe there is something to this biology thing.
so, blood is thicker than water.
the density of blood plasma in circulating blood cells is roughly twice the density of water.
Oh, my goodness! Patrick!
there, see? He's gonna be fine.
bunny? - Yes!
look at you, James Dean. - Well, we grew up on the same block.
Casey's going back to Afghanistan.
for how long? - I don't know.
he said he hadn't decided whether to re-enlist.
he will, unless... - Unless, what?
unless I marry him.
Hey. Baby, will you buy me a drink?
no. Thank you. - Whoa. Come on.
give it to me. - It's my know.
No! No one takes anything else from me tonight!
take it, then, you little bitch!
now? - No.
I'm so tired, my taste buds are asleep.
what are we eating? - A gluten-free almond cookie.
so it's supposed to taste like cardboard.
Oh. Come on, Frankie!
Maura and I put in an 18-hour day. I want to go home!
hold on! - Oh, let him impress you.
okay, she's ready.
Ta-da!
What?!
that looks amazing!
pop.
why are you here? I need a reason to see my family?
we haven't heard from you in over a year.
I'm sorry. - We're gonna need more than that.
come on, guys. Give him a break.
he just wanted to see the baby.
Really? Well, I don't see the baby. Do you, Frankie?
I know I should have called, but, uh, I wanted to surprise you kids.
great. We love your surprises.
surprise! I'm leaving your mother!
surprise! I slept with Tommy's girlfriend!
surprise! I left all you guys holding the bag when I stiffed the I.R.S. to the tune of 27, 000 bucks!
all right, all right, you know, could we not do this in front of people, please?
what pe... that's Maura!
I'm gonna go make some tea. Excuse me.
I'm here to speak to your mother. - About what?
I'll talk to you when you're not with him.
then you won't be talking. - How you doing, Frank?
how am I doing? Better before I saw you.
and what are you doing with my wife? Ex-wife, Frank.
and unless you're here to explain why you left me holding the bag with the I.R.S.
I want you to leave!
pop, w-why don't you just leave, okay?
where are you staying at?
I-I'm staying at the, uh, Lighthouse motel.
okay, so, you know, w-we'll talk tomorrow.
we? Speak for yourself.
good night, Frank. Kids, come inside for a cup of tea.
I'll see you later, Pop. - Yeah.
I-I-I gotta go to work, okay? - Y-you work too hard, Jane.
can you just go to the motel, please?
he has yet to apologize for taking off to Florida and hooking up with a bunch of bimbos.
well, apologizing is a major threat to identity and self-esteem if you're someone who struggles to manage strong emotions.
body's in the bathroom.
could be a robbery gone bad, no sign of a wallet or cellphone.
no I. D? - No.
who found her? - Manager.
people have been complaining for a while that the john was out of order.
so whoever killed her had time to get out of here.
did you find the weapon? - No. But we got people looking for it.
okay. Is this the victim's guitar?
I think so. We're gonna dust the guitar and the case for prints.
Hey, Frost, give me a bag, would you?
look at this.
looks like a piece of that stuff they put in gift baskets.
definitely a guitar player. She has calluses on her left fingertips.
look at the velour.
it's indented, like something hard was hidden in the case.
well, if she brought a guitar, she was planning on playing.
did you see the lineup? - Yeah, it's camp fire night at the Argot.
a bunch of female singer-songwriters. But she doesn't look like anyone on it.
they have an open mike from 10: 00 to 10: 30.
penetration wound to the posterior between the fifth intercostal rib and scapula and anterior between the fourth and fifth ribs in the cardiac notch.
can you tell the murder weapon we're looking for? Not until autopsy.
that'll be after I get some sleep.
let's get her to the morgue.
sleep deprivation is as much of an impairment as inebriation.
I do not like to make mistakes.
can you give me a hint? - Oh, do I have to?
what, do you want this conversation to end and go to bed?
well, you are looking for something with a sharp tip, although the wound is not incised laterally.
so, a knife with a pointy tip and dull sides.
I didn't say a knife. - We're looking for an SPT.
sharp pointy thing. - I am comfortable with that, yes.
everybody in here has a smartphone.
I'll call Frankie, get him to look at what's been posted on Instagram, - Vine, Twitter, Snapchat... - Stop, you're making me feel old.
you are old.
okay. I guess we're done here.
what are you doing here? - I needed to speak to you.
have you started drinking again?
Yeah. I needed my old friend.
what is it, the back-taxes thing? What?
I got cancer.
when did you find out?
a few weeks ago. It's prostate.
how bad? - They don't know yet.
they sent me here for a second opinion at mass general.
I'm sorry, Pop. - Yeah.
Jane, I just want... - Do you have any idea what you did to us, what you did to Ma?
I... look, it's hard for me to open up.
well, try. You put your family through hell, and I for one would like to know why. You were a good Dad.
we were a-a good family. We had good times, right?
Yes, we did. So, why ... why would you sleep with Lydia?
why would you do that to Ma and then just take off like that?
look, I loved your mother for a long time.
and when you kids were home and the business was good, we were happy.
but then you guys grew up and left.
business went bad, and there was just me and her.
I was just so unhappy, Janie.
so you're only back because you need us. I was hoping that you need me, too.
look, Jane, would you tell your mother about the cancer?
I need her, too.
and I know if it comes from you, she won't turn me down.
pop, I can't. I'll be here for you, okay? But...
you got to ask her for forgiveness before you can ask her for help.
Oh, Jane. Come on in.
can I get you some tea? Uh, no, thanks.
why did he tell me? Why do I always have to be the oldest?
prostate cancer is one of the most survivable cancers if it doesn't spread.
do you know what stage it's in? He didn't know.
I had to stop him when he started worrying about his manhood.
well, the good news is that 40% to 60% of men who were able to have erections before surgery are able to after.
please, spare me that good news.
are there any visible symptoms of prostate cancer?
you know, like a prostate limp or something?
no, Jane. Why?
it just... I'm not really sure I believe he has cancer.
why would he lie?
I don't know ... to get sympathy, maybe.
that's why he came back?
he's sick, isn't he?
and he wanted you to tell me, didn't he?
ma, he ... he told me because he's afraid to tell you.
he should be.
what does he have?
he has cancer, Ma.
prostate cancer. - I see.
okay.
I'll deal with him.
and I'll tell your brothers.
you go home. You get some sleep, okay?
I'm sorry to dump this on you, Ma.
you didn't, baby. You didn't. He did.
Thanks, Ma.
where are we on the case?
we I.D.'d the victim with her prints.
she was 21, a student at the Massachusetts music conservatory.
Natasha Osmanski. Why were her prints on file?
she was booked on a D.U.I. charge six weeks ago.
it's still pending. - Did you notify her parents?
told them early this morning. It was rough.
they're coming in later. Dad's apparently famous.
apparently? It's Alexi Osmanski.
I know him. He was left wing for the Bruins.
actually, he's a very famous composer and conductor.
all right, what about her stolen wallet, - and has anybody used her credit cards? - Not yet. Flagged them all.
anybody post any photos online of our victim?
tons of postings, but I haven't seen any photos of her yet.
I'll keep checking. - Yeah.
she doesn't have a facebook page.
even I have a facebook page. - With three friends.
I'll be your friend. - You already are.
all right, Maura's doing the autopsy. Uh, call me when the parents get here, okay?
stomach contents ... smell them. You know my policy.
unless that bile stew can help me track her movements before she was stabbed,
I do not sniff. I just thought you would recognize vanilla.
what, she had a drink with vanilla in it?
I don't know if it was a drink, but her blood-alcohol level was 0. 06.
so that's one or two drinks for a girl her size. What about her tox screen?
clean for common prescription and street drugs. Okay, talk to me about the murder weapon.
still unclear, but I did check the, uh, toolmark database.
there are hundreds of possibilities ...
knives, daggers, letter openers, nail clippers, and bayonets, - stilettos. - Stiletto shoes?
Yes, and stiletto blades. - Maura, you were supposed to narrow it down and not tell me we're still looking for a sharp pointy thing.
what's with the black stuff on the swab? Oh, I found it when I swabbed the posterior entry wound.
I was just about to give it to the crime lab.
you didn't sleep, did you? - No, not much.
Cavanaugh knows. - Well, of course he does.
he and your mother are a couple.
I mean, it's not like I want my parents to get back together, but...
Mnh-mnh. You don't think it's icky that my boss is...
sleeping with my mother?
no. But I-I can see why you do.
you're never old enough to hear the details of your mother's sex life.
ma just told Tommy and Frankie she needs moral support.
got a hit on the victim's credit card. Guy was using it right down the street at a 7-eleven.
they've taken him to interrogation. - Great. Let's go talk to him.
uh, Jane. What about your mother?
I have an interrogation to do. - No.
no? - You can't, Jane.
go take care of your mother.
but he's a suspect, Vince. - And Frost and I can handle him.
Where'd you get that shiner? - What shiner?
I'm guessing it happened when you took Natasha Osmanski's wallet.
who? - More like, "what" ?
dumb move to leave it in your glove compartment, Wayne.
no idea how it got there. This isn't a picture of you using her credit card?
it sure looks like you. - Hey, man, she gave me that card.
Oh, now she gave it to you. Was that right before you murdered her?
you two be tripping.
we were talking. She was into me.
she gave me that card to buy us some drinks. When I came back, she was gone.
we checked. Her card was not used at that bar.
so...
are you ready to stop wasting our time here?
okay, I took it. All right?
but that bitch was crazy. - Before or after you stabbed her?
I didn't stab her. I was just playing around.
but she started freaking out. "No one else is taking anything from me tonight"!
maybe because you took her wallet.
no, that was after she hauled off and hit me with her guitar case, dude.
so you followed her to the ladies' room, and you stabbed her.
no.
all right, the wallet was on the floor, so, yeah, I kept it.
a little payback for smashing my face. I'm the victim here.
take off your clothes, Wayne. - Oh, I don't swing that way, boys.
now you "be tripping," dude.
we're looking for Natasha's blood on your clothes.
strip. - I don't need to watch this.
I've seen it before.
Hey! You can't do this! - Oh, hey, sorry, forgot to mention.
you're under arrest ... for larceny and forgery.
now take off your clothes.
it's gonna be okay, right, Jane? - I don't know, Tommy.
let's get all the information first, okay?
Yeah, you know, we can't control the cancer, so let's just help Ma.
and if she wants to be there for him, whether he deserves it or not, then we be there for Ma.
what are you doing here? I'm taking your father to his oncology appointment.
your mother's been a godsend.
that's too bad you just figured that out.
you're wrecking it. Would you stop?
will you stop, Tommy? Listen, I know I don't deserve your forgiveness.
all I'm asking for is one last family dinner before it's too late.
please. - Okay, fine.
we'll do it at Maura's tonight, okay? Ma, you can't ask Maura to do that.
let's do it at Mario's. You know, just us family.
family? Maura is family.
she took me in when I had no place to live after you left me.
and you want our support?
well, it has to be done my way with my family.
okay. - Okay.
all right, let's go to the doctor. Call me when you're done, okay?
Yeah, listen, I was wondering. - Can you just...?
damn it. - Well, what's the matter?
we can't tie the guy who took our victim's credit cards to her murder, so we can only charge him with larceny.
I was wondering if you kids want to come to the doctor with me.
Yeah, Pop. Y-yeah.
Frankie and I got to get back to work, Pop. Sorry.
back to work.
okay. Sure.
come on.
we should go with them. - Yeah, we should.
I have results. - Dr. Isles, you seen Jane?
uh, she just texted me. She's looking for Angela.
what happened with Frank? - I don't know.
she said to get started without her.
so, the black, gritty substance I found in the wound was transferred from the weapon.
it's keratin hydrolysates, acetate nitrocellulose, - and zinc sulfide. - I hear "fingernails" in there.
was the rest of it nail polish? - Black nail polish ... very good.
so the killer was a woman. You might want to update the era you're living in.
guys wear nail polish now. - Some guys.
so what's the weapon? A nail file?
possibly. A steel eight-inch nail file is consistent with the wound tracks.
sounds like a crime of opportunity. Girl in a bar goes to the ladies' room.
she's attacked and stabbed to death with what could have been a nail file.
only real motive we have is she had something in her guitar case the killer wanted.
I wish I could tell you what made that indentation.
all I know for sure was that it was a hard cylinder, roughly 10 inches tall with a 5-inch circumference.
could be a lot of things. - What about stomach contents?
mostly bile, but we were able to identify althea officinalis.
it's a marshmallow root. That bar serve marshmallow root?
uh... they don't serve much.
no, I'm not seeing anything with marshmallows in it.
so she was somewhere else before the bar.
you know, althea officinalis is also an herbal remedy for gastrointestinal distress, colitis, and urinary-tract infection.
did she have any of those... issues?
I have ordered her medical records. And they are on their way.
you want to talk?
is it bad, Ma?
it looks bad, honey.
victim's parents are here.
your daughter was adopted, then? - Yes.
there were so many unwanted babies in Russia. We fell in love with her.
we didn't know it would be so hard for her ... for us.
like many orphans, Natasha had an attachment disorder.
by the time she was 3, Alexi realized she was a music prodigy.
one time she was on my lap, and I missed a chord. And she says, "you missed one, papa."
and she plays "E" major for me.
perfectly.
and she continued to play piano? - Uh, yes, yes.
she was, uh, awarded a scholarship.
at the Massachusetts conservatory of music. That's very prestigious.
when did she add guitar? - Guitar?
she didn't play guitar.
did you know your daughter had been arrested for driving under the influence?
Yes. - It was my fault she drank.
I push her. - No, we ... we both did.
she was so shy.
I-I think she drank because she was terrified to perform.
her, uh, doctor suggested she enter an addiction-treatment program.
that's where she's been for the past month.
stanza rehab center. She was there yesterday?
that's what we thought, but apparently they were allowing her to leave.
did she have a cellphone or a computer in rehab?
uh, we kept her phone. Stanza didn't allow it.
and she wasn't allowed use of the internet, either.
but she had a computer? - For school work, yes.
did Natasha have a boyfriend? - No.
how about friends? - She was never good at making friends.
I-I can't imagine her going to a bar.
she brought a guitar to the bar. Why would she do that?
it doesn't make sense. She didn't play.
she wouldn't go to a bar. - But she was there, Alexi.
Oh, god, how did we get it so wrong?
we are both so sorry for your loss.
what the hell?
I cannot confirm or deny.I cannot confirm or deny.
stanza rehab won't even confirm Natasha was a patient.
we're gonna need a warrant to get her records.
I've been going through her wallet. She had a Boston city all-transit pass.
victim had a B-cat pass? - Everything okay?
no. But thanks for asking.
okay, uh, did you trace the pass? Yeah, it's just coming up.
okay, this is weird. She only took the green line, and she only got on and off at one station ... Symphony.
she rode around in circles? - Maybe she never left the station.
Yeah, there are a lot of buskers in that subway station.
what the hell is a busker? - It's a street performer.
I hear the good ones can make like 700 bucks a day. We are in the wrong line of work.
Hey, you need to have a talent. - I got talent.
one that people will pay to see.
B-cat transit makes you register with them and issues a performer permit and I. D. badge, don't they?
Yeah. - I'll check to see if she had a permit.
her mom said she was terrified of performing, though.
apparently that's what began the drinking.
Nope, she wasn't registered.
Hey, maybe we need to check out "American Idol."
that's where kids go to get discovered nowadays, right? No, man.
you blog and post and try to get yourself on one of the big music sites, like Pitchfork.
pitchfork? What kind of name is that?
a review on that blog is like making the cover of Rolling Stonin' your day.
her parents said she didn't play guitar.
those calluses on her fingers say different.
doesn't play guitar, doesn't drink, and yet we find her dead in a bar with alcohol in her system and with a guitar.
Yeah, on a night with a half-hour of open mike - for female singer-songwriters. - She was there to sing.
odds are she was in Symphony station to sing, too.
maybe our shy, friendless classical musician was leading a double life.
frost, can you do a search to see if she posted anything with her singing?
no, nothing using her name.
I'm gonna try "girl, Symphony station, guitar."
Yeah, here's something somebody else posted. Let's see what it is.
wow, what a voice. - Yeah, she's the real deal.
nice lyrics.
Hey, bitch, that's my spot! - Hey, leave her alone!
Hey, mind your own business! And don't let me catch you here again!
this is my spot! - I'm so sorry.
we need to find that guy.
Hey, Delroy, you got a minute? The name's Busta Bucket.
put some money in, and I might talk to you.
I thought your name was Delroy. - Yeah. Delroy King?
you did 10 years at Walpole for manslaughter.
you five-oh?
I'm cool. I got my performance license.
which is for inside the subway at your assigned spot, not out here on the public street.
how come you left your spot down below?
come on, man. This is hard work. It's hot down there.
where were you last night from 9: 00 to 10: 00?
with my old lady, banging a different kind of drum.
Yeah. You know this girl?
no.
mind your own business! And don't let me catch you here again!
this is my spot! She came back, didn't she?
that's why you followed her and stabbed her.
hell, no! I didn't stab her!
I tried to scare her off, but... the girl could sing.
so I let her work my spot, and she gave me some of the money.
well, she's dead now, Delroy. - I didn't touch that girl!
all right, pack up your buckets.
what? Nah, I can't leave my station.
Yeah, you can. You're gonna come down to our station till we can check out your story. Let's go.
Oh, is this the crinkled paper I found in her guitar case?
you know, the crime lab found traces of cacao-bean extract on it.
chocolate? - Yeah.
where was she between rehab and the bar?
and what was she hiding in the guitar case?
what about Mr. Bucket?
dead end. Busta's alibi checks out.
he was with his old lady. The neighbors saw him come home.
what if this is just some random killing that we can't solve?
don't say that. - Well, I mean, there are a lot of homicide departments that have piles of unsolved cases like this one.
why are you talking like this?
my father's PSA numbers came back, and they're through the roof.
it's not a-a very reliable test.
numbers can rise with a routine prostate examination or even digital stimulation during sexual experimentation.
Maura, stop. - Have they done his ultrasound yet?
it's tomorrow. You want to come over for dinner?
crap, I was gonna ask you the same thing. What does that mean?
I'm so sorry.
tuna casserole.
Vienna sausage wrapped in bacon with water chestnuts.
Jello mold, Boston cream pie.
um, where are the vegetables? - Right here. Canned corn.
Frank's favorite. We'll eat extra kale tomorrow.
how hard is it to remember where the fork goes? I'll show you where the fork goes.
boys, knock it off! Our guests are gonna be here any minute.
wait. Guests, plural?
I'll get it.
Hey, Pop. Hey.
how you doing? All right.
how's my boy? All right? - I'm good.
Hi, Frank. - Hi.
nice flowers, huh, Ma? - Yeah. Thanks.
Hi. - Blue carnations?
they're actually white. But dip them in blue dye, with capillary action, you get that.
listen, I don't think this is a good idea tonight.
well, it's one bottle for six people. It's all right. Come on.
it's okay.
who's that? - I told you we're gonna do things my way.
Hey. - Hi, honey.
thank you.
well, uh, we certainly have an interesting case that we're working on, don't we, Jane?
Yeah. Uh... yeah, why don't you tell them about it?
um, well, it's tragic, really. - I'll say.
the case. I mean, the victim.
she was a child prodigy.
I was a prodigy. I could skate backwards when I was 3.
that was me skating backwards holding you up.
you were no prodigy. He ... he was like an idiot savant.
but that was because of the way he could play chess.
useless at everything else.
Tommy did a lot of things well, Pop.
and Frankie here ... see this kid? This kid had a million-dollar arm.
I thought you'd be playing for the Red Sox.
Yeah. Me too. - He kept whining about his sore elbow.
want to know why? You know what coach Tony said?
Tommy, don't waste your breath. - No, I'm gonna say it.
you made him throw so many curve balls, he threw his arm out.
Nah. He was a quitter!
and you. Be honest, you babied him.
Frank, you know what alcohol does to your tongue.
don't embarrass me here.
it's okay. I'm sober. - I'm sober, too, Frank.
it's okay, Pop. We all know what alcohol does to you.
Yeah, and for the record, uh, Frankie is a great Detective.
and Tommy is a great father.
you know, on that note, I got to go see my kid.
Yeah. I'm gonna get out of here, too.
thanks for dinner, Ma.
Hey. Hey, I...
Hey, I was just busting balls. I'm just kidding!
where you going?! I'm busting balls!
I think I should go, too. - I'll walk you out.
no, let him go! I want to talk to my wife.
but she's not your wife no more, Frank. And you're gonna show some respect starting now.
Yeah, come on. You gonna make me?!
yeah... - No, no! Come on. Stop it!
stop it! Pop, stop! - Come on!
let me take you to the motel, okay? - Look at yourself, Frank.
okay? Come on. Come on.
come on. Let's go to the motel.
just like I thought. You're a coward. - That's it, Frank...
no, stop it! - Stop. Sean.
please, Daddy... - Go ahead, hurt Angela again.
it won't be the prostate that kills you, Frank.
Sean, come on... - Please, Daddy. Please.
just get him out of here! - Just stop!
pop, come on.
I'm sorry.
you know, all that crap that you say to Tommy and Frankie ...
you can't ever take that back, Pop!
I'm sorry, Maura.
coffee? Danish?
what's the occasion? - We just want you to know we care.
thank you. My Dad's an asshole, too.
okay, well, let's get back to work so I don't spend the day in the fetal position.
frost, you said the creep that stole Natasha's credit card said she was upset about having other things taken?
Yeah. He said she said something about, "nobody else is taking anything from me tonight."
could she have meant something other than her purse? Well, now we're talking.
we just got a warrant to dig through Natasha's stay at Stanza. Let's take a ride to rehab.
I'm not happy to be presented with a warrant with such a broad scope.
it's one thing to invade Natasha's privacy.
this is a homicide investigation.
but Natasha wasn't killed here. Check the visitors log.
she signed out at 7: 35 P. M. - Thank you. I think we will.
if you don't allow cellphones or access to the internet here why would you allow your patients to come and go at their own will?
we provide structure here, but we also provide freedom.
it's not a prison. - Are Natasha's things still in her room?
Yes.
Oh, I got her computer.
this doesn't get played much.
does that mean something? I don't think it's Natasha's guitar.
her action was set up perfectly.
this one, the action's wrong. It's high, uneven.
holy crap. Where'd you learn to play like that?
I taught myself. You could make real money on the subway.
then I wouldn't get to look at you all day long.
um, did Natasha have a roommate? - Kelsey's in the music room.
she's leading Natasha's memorial service.
it's the same song Natasha was singing in the subway.
Natasha had a much better voice, though.
I'm having trouble believing she's gone.
was there anyone here who had a problem with her?
anyone that she didn't like? - God, no.
I can't imagine anyone hurting her.
she was like a kitten or a puppy. She barely talked.
how was she doing in rehab? - Okay, I guess.
she said she liked music therapy as long as she didn't have to play in front of people.
play piano or guitar? Or both?
she only played piano. - But she had a guitar.
Yeah, but I never heard her play it. So you didn't know she was performing in the subway?
I-in public? Natasha? No way.
that's why she wanted to leave the conservatory. I wonder how her parents felt about that.
she said they flipped.
the conservatory's all about performance. By senior year, that's all you do.
Natasha couldn't perform unless she was loaded.
I'm guessing she was trying to decide between sobriety and performing.
according to Stanza's visitors log, the only people who ever visited her were her parents.
so I'm just wondering who did this. - Did what?
some of the files on Natasha's hard drive have been wiped out.
actually, it's a lot of them.
can you get it back? - No.
and it wasn't password-protected. Anybody could have done it.
I can't tell when, either. I went through Natasha's medical records at Stanza.
there's nothing to indicate she was taking any kind of marshmallow-root supplement.
then how did that get in her stomach?
you know, I'll check again to see if there are any other uses for althea officinalis.
frost, you're sure the bar didn't sell any food or drinks - that has marshmallow root in it? - Yeah.
maybe somebody gave her a supplement?
well, that's interesting. - What? What did you find?
it's speculation. - It's homicide. We speculate up here.
well, that's the flower for althea officinalis.
that's the marshmallow-root flower. - On the bottle of Mallow vodka.
which means there's marshmallow root in it. It doesn't list the ingredients.
it doesn't have to. Look at the shape of the indentation.
that's what Natasha had with her.
liquid courage. She was gonna sing that night.
but why would the killer take the bottle? I've been looking at Natasha's homework.
she was supposed to be composing classical symphonies.
but she's writing something else here.
that's the song that Natasha was singing in the subway.
what, you think she composed it? - Maybe. But why hide it?
maybe because her classical-musician father - didn't approve of indie rock.
Natasha's roommate, Kelsey, got a gift basket delivered at 7: 00 P. M.
Natasha signed for it. - That's how the vodka got in.
that rehab place doesn't check deliveries.
Barbara said Natasha left the rehab facility at 7: 35, right after that gift basket was delivered.
the crinkle-cut paper had chocolate on it.
Yeah, and what would you put in a gift basket that you were giving to someone who was performing on camp fire night?
the ingredients for s'mores. - Yeah, chocolates and marshmallow vodka.
that's what Natasha had in her guitar case, and that's why the killer took the bottle.
it sounds better when Natasha sings it, doesn't it?
I'm ... I'm rehearsing. I've got a show.
your shy roommate didn't know how valuable her songs were, but you did, didn't you?
Natasha told you she was gonna take that microphone and sing her own song in front of the record company that signed you.
broad Sound records wanted to hear their new star.
because it's my song. That's why Broad Sound records signed me.
when did you write it?
about a month ago. - How did you do that?
it was posted on youtube six months ago. - You don't even play that, do you?
that's just a prop. You're no singer-songwriter.
when you couldn't get your music career going, you started to drink.
rehab turned out to be just the break you needed.
too bad about that damn gift basket. There it was on the card for Natasha to read.
what did it say ... "Congrats on your new hit.
see you at the Argot"? Natasha stole my gift basket so she could get drunk.
she was already unstable. She showed up here angry and out of control.
she showed up to sing. And when Broad Sound heard her voice and her story ...
that you'd stolen her music and her lyrics ... your new career was over.
nice black nail polish. It's a new coat?
we need a sample to see if it matches the stuff we found in Natasha's stab wounds.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
they all kept telling me, no, they wanted singer-songwriters, so I took some of her songs.
I recorded them, and I put them up.
they went viral, and then it spun out of control.
you're under arrest for the murder of Natasha Osmanski.
what are you doing here?
he came here to tell you something... himself.
I came here to apologize... to you, Jane.
and you, Maura.
I was a pig last night.
don't blame it on the wine, Pop. - I said some terrible things.
I screwed up. I'm sorry.
well, thank you for apologizing.
that must be hard for you.
it is. It always has been.
but I got some good news. I do have cancer, but they said it was... stage 2.
that's very treatable.
I'm glad to hear that.
I want you to forgive me, Jane. Please.
you're my number-one daughter.
I'm your only daughter, Pop.
okay, so, now what?
I'm thinking about moving back to Boston.
you have a new life in Florida, Frank. I have a new life here.
what are you saying, Ang? - I'm saying...
you're not my husband anymore.
you'll always be our children's father.
and I'll be here if you need me.
but you should go back.
Jane? - No, stay in touch, Pop.
it's a short flight. Come back anytime.
okay.
you take care of yourself, Angela. - You too, Frank.
goodbye, my sweet big girl.
I love you, Daddy. - I love you, too.
all right.
okay.
so...
now that we're all good and depressed, what should we do?
I have some jello from last night.
nobody ate it. - Well, that's a shock.
I have some cookies. - The ones that taste like cardboard?
the night just gets better and better!
Oh, good, well, I'm glad I saved some for you.
I'm really proud of the way you handled yourself, Ma.
I'm proud of you, Jane... and your brothers ...
that's who I'm proud of.
and thanks for putting up with us nut balls, Maura.
what do you mean, putting up with you?
you're my nut balls! You're my family.
okay! Harder! Harder! Don't stop!
don't ever stop! Keep going!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
this ain't some fancy workou, girls, and it sure ain't yog.
my workout will get you in shape. You'll become a fighting machine.
you work out with me, and I'l turn you into one tough broa.
we're doing it all here. Come on. Work out.
see her form? See what she's doing? Yes! Ye!
you are one tough broad!
enough already.
you're only gonna be gone for three days.
you're pregnant. You're vitamining for two.
do we need to revisit the pictures of the iron-deficient spleen?
I'm so excited for your medical examiner's convention.
is there anything I can do that will help you get out the door?
take your pyridoxine. - Is it the one that looks like Fred Flintstone or Barney Rubble?
I'm gonna miss you. - I'm gonna miss you, too.
Mwah! But I'm excited I'm gonna get to spend some one-on-one time with Jane.
so, there will be a temporary fill-in M. E.
and Susie will be available at the crime lab. And, of course, I'm always available by phone.
day or night. - Everything is gonna be fine.
Yeah, but, I mean, I don't know. What if something goes wrong with the house?
or we have another big case? Maybe I should just stay.
I thought you were really looking forward to this. I was.
but ... ?
Graywoods casino.
food by Wolfgang Puck. - Oh.
table magic by David Blaine. - What?
sounds incredibly awesome.
I know. Way better than my convention.
what? The one you hosted? It was a big hit.
Yeah, but it just wasn't ... fun.
well, medical-examiner conventions aren't supposed to be fun.
that's not the point. They're supposed to be educational.
andrea Bocelli. Double hubba-hubba.
I'm marrying you off before Maura gets back. Good luck.
Rizzoli. - Isles. Yes. I'll be right out.
okay. I'm on my way.
cab. - Homicide.
maybe I should stay. - Go to the convention. Save a life.
okay, we're walking. We're moving. We're going.
see. You're having fun already.
sergeant Korsak. - Morning, Jenkins.
guy just left this for you. Bobby Symanski.
Korsak. I'll be right there.
Hey. - Hey. The temp M. E. is on his way.
deceased is Judith Barnett, 40.
multiple stab wounds on her back. Weapon?
two round blood smears on either side of her, - so the killer was kneeling over her. - No sign of forced entry.
neighbor saw a white truck gunning away from the curb.
license plate? - No. And no description of the driver.
neighbor saw the open door, came in, found the body, called 911.
what about relatives? The victim's husband, Alan, is a dentist.
he's been with a patient, in surgery. Here's the address.
all right. Let us know what you turn up.
we'll go talk to Alan.
Dr. Barnett should be finished any moment.
are you sure I can't help you, detectives? Uh, no, thank you.
we really do need to speak to Dr. Barnett.
here you go, sweetie. Thanks.
see you tomorrow. Oh, here he is.
you have someone coming to pick you up, right?
my son ... Sam. - Excellent.
very good driver, Sam.
I'm sure. Good to see you, Marion.
Dr. Barnett. These detectives from the Boston police would like to speak with you.
Oh. Really? Why?
what time did you leave the house this morning?
6: 15. Judith was asleep.
I met Mrs. Gold here at 6: 30.
and your receptionist can confirm that? - What?
no. She comes in at 8: 00.
I was alone with Mrs. Gold for the gum graft.
she needs extra attention.
I told Judith that something like this might happend.
what do you mean? - Judith was big all her life ...
as a girl, when I met her, when we got married.
and I loved her. Just the way she was.
but she didn't love herself. She tried dieting. Never worked.
then, a year ago, she found tough broad.
the workout. - She lost a hundred pounds.
and I was really worried for her. - Could explain that for us?
she was a grown woman who'd never learned how to deal with men's advances because no one was ever interested.
most woman develop some kind of defenses as teenagers.
Judith was getting a lot of attention from men. She didn't know how to handle it.
excuse me.
Frankie. Was there a specific man giving your wife attention?
no, but ...
guys were starting conversations with her in the supermarket.
waiters were fawning over her. The mailman hung around to chat.
okay. Thanks.
did that bother you? - Me? No.
I was proud.
I was the guy with this amazing wife.
was Judith expecting anyone at your house this morning?
our handyman. He's been putting in new insulation.
and what is his name? - Luis Benitez.
we'll be in touch, Dr. Barnett.
we are very sorry for your loss.
what's up? - That call from Frankie.
they found the knife used to stab Judith.
it's got the initials "L. B." carved into the handle.
let's have some uniforms bring Luis Benitez in for a chat.
let's.
he's got a long rap sheet.
multiple arrests for breaking and entering. Multiple incidents of assault with a deadly weapon.
wild guess on the weapon ... a knife? - Wild and correct.
Korsak. He did so much work for the Barnetts, they set up an account for him at factory hill hardware.
he bought locks a month ago. So he'd have a key.
could this get any easier?
when the uniforms went to pick up Luis, he was gone.
his mother said he went out of town ... took some clothes, left in a hurry.
so our guy's not ready to jump into cuffs just yet.
what's up, Chang? - Jane!
uh, Dr. Crosby gave me the initial findings from the crime scene.
well, why didn't he give them to me?
Oh, there's a reason why he works in a one-man office in Maine.
Anyhoo ... these are Judith's wounds.
the length and the shape of the knife found at the scene match the wound pattern.
the edges were serrated, which is why ribs were broken and bone was sawed off.
what about the blood on the knife? - Matches the victim.
no fibers or hair on the body that weren't hers.
so you think the killer snuck up behind her and stabbed her?
I can't say. - Well, take a guess.
I'm a scientist. - So's Maura. She does it.
I'm not Dr. Isles.
I know that, but she's not here. So, throw out a theory.
stretch your wings and grow. It's your time to shine.
that's a mixed metaphor.
okay, see. There you go. That's very Maura.
Nope. Okay.
# You thought you were tough # - Oh, hey, Angela.
# You thought you were hard # - Hi. Who's that?
Bobby Symanski, my friend Peter's grandson.
he's good. - Very.
I like that song.
his grandfather wrote it. We used to have a band.
Wow. He must be proud.
# Come on and take a little walk ... # - He's dead.
I'm sorry.
Oh, it's a long time ago. Bobby dropped this off.
he's playing in Boston.
that's great. You gonna go see him?
he wants me to play with him. - Vince, even better!
I don't play those songs anymore. It's not who I am.
you know, in one lifetime, we lead a lot of different lives.
well, that one's over. - If ... you want it to be.
tell Jane I was looking for her. - Sure thing.
luis was an almost constant presence at the house the last year.
so he witnessed Judith's total transformation.
Hi! - Hold on.
no more shots for Carla. - I'm not driving!
more shots for Carla! - Whoo!
continue. Well, they spent a lot of time together.
uh, maybe that allowed Luis to think there was something more going on than her just being nice.
what is going on in your room?
I've turned it into a hospitality suite with an open bar.
Ah! Good job, Gary!
he hit the bull's-eye. - Great.
well, it looks like you're having fun. - Jane, it's a nightmare.
Carla is out of control, and they've wrecked my room.
and now they think I'm this crazy party person.
you're not?
look, don't do anything that makes you uncomfortable, all right? Just be yourself.
right. Absolutely. Good advice.
Dr. Isles! We're dry over her!
well, give me that bottle of rye, and I'll show you how to make a Dr. Pecker!
Hey, Frankie.
uniforms spotted Luis' car in the South end.
okay. Where are you?
in an alleyway near the corner of Mass and Columbus.
there he is, Jane. I gotta go.
he's coming out the back. Move. Move!
Freeze! Boston police!
put your hands on the car.
get your hands on the car!
okay! Ow! Okay!
didn't you learn anything the last time you got arrested, Luis? Don't run.
makes you look guilty. No, I'm innocent, man!
tell us what happened yesterday morning.
I showed up for work at the Barnetts'. I knocked on the door.
no one answered. So I used my key.
I walked around, and I found Mrs. Barnett.
but I didn't do it. - Then why did you run?
because I've got a record. Because I know how it looks.
cause no one believes an ex-con. Do you have your initials on all your tools?
no, just my knife.
to remind me that what's used for evil can also be used for good.
and where is that knife now?
I don't know. I can't find it.
you've got multiple priors for robbery,
breaking and entering, three separate stabbings.
all that time in the house with Judith.
you must have thought that could go somewhere.
so you made a move on her. And when she refused, you got mad.
that could have happened. - It did happen.
no. But it could have.
I had no self-control.
when I got out of prison the last time, even moms told me she wasn't gonna be there for me, that I had shamed her, that I ... that I had shamed God.
and I heard her.
I went back to our church. I went to A. A.
moms gave me my room back, and I moved in so she could see I was trying.
and I changed.
well, Judith was changing, too. That must have been attractive to you.
Yes. Yes, it was.
I-I ...
she became a different person. S-s-she ...
it gave me hope. I told her so.
she inspired me.
Padre nuestro, que estas en el ciel.
what does your gut tell you? We need evidence.
he knew the victim. He was in her house.
the murder weapon belonged to him.
what about motive? - I can think of 10.
me, too, but none of them feel right.
we've got no witnesses and nothing but the knife to tie him to the murder.
what do you want to do?
give me five minutes.
Susie! I was, uh, just coming to talk to you.
Oh, I'm not there. I'm here. To show you how I shine.
okay. Great.
what's that? - It's my theory.
your theory's in a box? It's a "die-o-rama."
Oh. D-I-E. - Yes.
for dead people. - Well, not all of them are dead.
but it's a representation of how they got to be. It's amazing.
Yes.
and the killer is wearing a Tyvek suit. Yes.
because there was no forensic evidence found at the crime scene, which means the killer was wearing some sort of protective outerwear.
the handyman had Tyvek suits in his truck.
Yes. - You made all this just to tell me that?
no, I made this to figure it out. I'm a visual thinker.
well ... it's fantastic.
really. Susie, thank you. We got him.
except the handyman didn't do it. - Okay, but you said ...
the handyman's too tall to make the stab wounds at the angle of entry they were made on Judith's body.
see, this killer is to scale, but your suspect would not be to scale.
but the Tyvek suit ...
he uses them a lot. Maybe someone knew that.
you just guessed. - I ... theorized.
you guessed. No, no. You guessed.
that was a guess. That was ...
you don't use these things to illustrate stuff - in your personal life, right? - Uh ... okay.
Luis, you spent a lot of time at the Barnett house.
did you ever see anything unusual?
mostly Mrs. Barnett was alone.
the only person that came by was the tough broad guy.
Mickey Rizzo. - Yeah, the boxer.
he was over all the time ... private coaching.
they always closed the door.
we talked to Luis Benitez's parole officer, his A. A. sponsor, his mother, his bible-studies group.
they all tell the same story ... he's a changed man.
the knife wounds are precise and deliberate.
not what you'd expect from an ex-con with anger issues.
and Susie says he's not to scale. What?
we'll talk about Susie when you get back. Hey.
I think it's time we go meet the man - who turned Judith into a tough broad. - I've got another lead to pursue.
take Frankie. - Sure. You okay?
great.
did you get a chance to go over those case files I sent you?
Jane, you shouldnt have sent these.
it's a serious violation of protocol. This is Dr. Crosby's case.
he's the only one authorizd to release these files.
well, I didn't want to bother him. He was too busy going slow.
well, this makes e very uncomfortable.
just take a look, please. See if you see anything.
come on, Maura! We're playing "autopsy jeopardy!
well, I see you've turned it back into your kind of convention.
Oh, yeah. Last night was a bit much.
Carla threw my toilet seat out the window.
one game, and then we're watching my slide show.
Oh, no, don't do that to the ...
Hey, Vince! - Hey.
this thing is huge!
if Maura ever kicks me out, I'm gonna move right in.
what's that? - My old guitar, from when I played with Bobby's grandfather.
I'm gonna give it to Bobby. That's nice. It's not what he wants.
Yeah, but it's family history. - History is for old people.
well, what do you think he wants? - Come on, Vince.
you're smarter than that. Think about it.
Bye! - Bye-bye.
how well do you know Judith Barnett?
very well. She joined the gym a year ago.
Hey, what she did with her body took a lot of work and a lot of time.
you gave her a lot of personal attention, make her feel special.
I mean, yeah. That's a big part of my job.
Really? - Look, these women ...
they don't get a lot of attention from their husbands.
they come here to feel better about themselves.
and if part of that's me flirting with them, well, hey, that's good for business.
you ever go to her house? - I set up her gym.
are we gonna find your DNA in her bedroom? Why are you asking about DNA?
were you having an affair with Judith Barnett?
no. Look. You know what? Judy was a client.
where were you yesterday morning between 7: 00 and 9: 00?
asleep. - Alone?
you know what?
I'm not gonna answer any more questions, all right? Okay.
we're gonna need a list of your clients and your investors.
and we'll let them answer the questions.
Hey, you know what? I'm the pride of East Boston, all right?
I'm golden gloves in two weight classes.
that's great, but it does ... - Hey, you know, it's taken me years to build this business and gain these women's trust.
you were alone when she was murdered. That doesn't help you.
you see how this looks, Mickey?
all right, look. I wasn't alone.
what's her name? - This could ruin me.
prison will ruin you.
look, you got it all wrong. It's not like that.
I mean, these women here, they're all great, but ...
I'm gay.
it would kill my business if it got out.
all right. All right. It won't get out.
thank you. - Yeah.
look, Judy wasn't doing anything with anyone.
she spent all her time working out. But this dentist, he just ...
I don't know. He lost interest in her.
did she talk to her husband about this?
for sure, she did. She invited him to come down here, see what this place was all about, but he never came.
you know, she thought they'd work out together once they got the gym in the house, but he never did.
all he did was go to his old cabin every weekend and leave a beautiful woman at home, alone.
Thanks, Mickey. We'll let you know if we need anything else.
well, he was doing something. - Or someone.
it's not exactly something a married man leaves out in the open when he's cheating.
one toothbrush, a can of shaving cream, a single disposable razor.
no sign of another person being here, let alone a woman.
Yeah, same thing here ...
a couple of single-serve frozen dinners from the trash, water bottles.
he wasn't here to fish, either. No poles, no tackle, no boat.
well, so what? He comes up here to get away from it all and practice his dentistry skills?
something you should see outside.
is Alan opening a fruit stand? - It's not a great location.
better be some interesting garbage.
I think it's a bullet hole.
I think Alan used these for target practice.
so what? The victim was stabbed.
I know it doesn't make any sense, but ...
no. You're right. It's crazy.
Alan's amazing wife is waiting at home and he's out here in woodlandia, playing with his dental tools and shooting at watermelons?
Why? There's got to be more to it.
let's get all this back to the crime lab, - have Susie take a look at it. - Yep.
did you find anything yet? What's that?
it's not watermelon, but it came from inside of one.
the broken watermelons all have it.
well, can you take your best guess? Chalk?
I shouldn't. I can't.
Jane, Susie has been trained not to guess.
Really?
well, can she tell me what made these holes?
Circumferentially, they're the same dimension as a 22-caliber bullet.
Jane, it took you one whole day to corrupt senior criminalist Chang.
pbht! - I'm so sorry, Dr. Isles.
detective Rizzoli means well, but you cannot let her impatience influence your methodology.
you forgot to activate the cone of silence.
well, can we at least talk about ...
whatever it is you two are doing here?
Susie's pursuing an interesting line of inquiry, a forensic examination of the victims.
Victims"? What ... what victims?
those aren't victims. Those are watermelons.
I am conducting a "fruit-opsy."
that's funny. - Hilarious. I'll check in later.
I'm going to go get a sus-ictionary.
there you go.
Hey, Vince. - Hey, Angela.
well, you can keep it from me, Vince, but you can't keep it from yourself.
it's a lot more complicated than the loss of an old friend, Angela.
complications. Secrets. Pain. Happiness.
they're all the spices in the soup.
you leave one out, it doesn't taste as good.
Peter & Vince.
we had a meeting with an A&R record guy from New York.
he took us out on the town. He wined us. He dined us.
at the end of the night, Peter wanted to go home. He wanted to see his wife and kid.
but not me. I was flying.
I didn't want that night to end.
I let him walk home alone, drunk.
he took a shortcut across some railroad tracks.
he fell. He hit his head.
never woke up. - Mm.
it snowed that night. Took a couple of days to find his body.
so ... how do I tell Bobby I killed his grandfather?
Oh, come on, Vince. You know that's not true.
well, I should have ...
no, this is not about you, my friend. This is about Bobby.
it's about what he wants, what only you can give him.
what the hell could I possibly give Bobby?
how about a little piece of his grandfather?
because he's still alive here in your heart.
detective Rizzoli, I have the lab report.
and another box. - It's my findings from the fruit-opsy.
they're a little hard to explain, so I did the only logical thing.
you made another die-o-rama. - To scale.
okay, well, Frankie said that he thought the watermelons were being used for target practice.
I agree.
the bullet traveled through and through this one.
the projectile struck the back wall of the watermelon and tore out a chunk.
but in that watermelon, the bullet didn't come out.
there were no bullets in the watermelons. Could you have missed them?
Oh, no, the external examination of the subjects showed no other means of exit.
and the X-rays were negative for any foreign bodies within.
e-except ... - Except what?
nothing. - Psst.
Maura's not here.
that stuff I found was dental plaster. It's made from gypsum.
and it was different in each watermelon.
almost as if they came from different batches.
he was trying to make a bullet that couldn't be detected in an autopsy.
he was? - Well, of course he was, Susie.
everyone knows the die-o-rama doesn't lie. I'll be careful.
Oh, no! I should have wrote "handle with care" on that one.
alan was trying to make a bullet out of dental plaster, something that would break apart once it entered Judith's body.
is that even possible?
air marshals use bullets that won't pass through a body and hurt an innocent passenger or damage the structure of the plane.
is that Susie's die-o-rama?
it's very realistic. And to scale, and the detail ...
focus, Maura.
well, I just think that detailed work deserves appreciation.
okay.
the plaster bullet that did this was too hard.
it went all the way throug, and it didn't break apart. So he mixed and remixed the plaster.
that would explain all the broken-up watermelons in the compost bin.
that's right. Until he found the perfect formula.
maximum damage with no exit wound. And there'd be no ballistics.
I'd like to remind everyone, again, that Judith Barnett was stabbed to death.
I'm not so sure of that.
I mean, there's something about the nature of the knife wounds that's been bothering me.
Frankie, can you pull up the X-rays?
see, this wound is narrow and it's not as deep as the surrounding damage.
is that a fragment from the dental plaster?
no, according to the autopsy report, it's a bone fragment that penetrated the pericardium.
it broke off. That's what happens when you are stabbed.
Yes, she was stabbed. But the wound track here is too narrow.
that bone fragment was not driven into the wound by the knife.
Jane, I'd like Susie to examine the bone fragments from the wounds.
okay, and I want her to test Judith's clothes for gunshot residue.
why would he shoot her first and then stab her?
because if Alan snuck up on this woman with a knife and she caught him, she'd kick his ass.
if Alan wanted to make a dental-plaster bullet, he'd need two things ...
he'd need a gun and something to make a cartridge.
well, the holes in the watermelons were the size of a .22-caliber.
I borrowed some from ballistics.
he'd need to pull out the lead bullet from the casing and then replace it with the one he made.
he spent a lot of time pulling teeth with these things.
I believe he could take ... a bullet out of a cartridge.
well, that was easy enough. No gun license in Massachusetts or anywhere else for Alan Barnett. None for Judith, either.
so, how the hell did he get a gun?
I don't see Alan Barnett going out and making a street buy.
he didn't have to. This is a crime-scene photo of the cabin.
I had that part blown up.
young Alan Barnett had a Ruger Bearcat, . 22 caliber.
good little squirrel gun. I know Dr. Crosby says death by stabbing.
he's not Maura.
what have you got? - Hi, Detective Rizzoli.
I was just about to give my results to Dr. Isles.
well, you have done a wonderful job of not guessing and preserving your scientific mythology.
thank you. It's methodology, Jane.
I say tomato, you say "tomaht-ology"
what have we got? GSR on the clothes?
Susie, would you describe for us what you're seeing in the microscope?
Yes, of course, Dr. Isles.
there are no bone-growing cells or proteins present in these bone fragments.
these bone fragments are from cadaver bone, not your victim's ribs.
the bone fragments have to be part of the bullet that Alan made.
it's brilliant, really.
I mean, all he had to do was add pieces of cadaver bone to the dental plaster before it hardened.
he created the perfect delivery system.
and the knife wounds were meant to splinter the ribs to hide the cadaver bone in the wound tracks.
and to set up the handyman.
alan used Luis' knife. He knew he had a record.
it's a great plan, actually.
except for the one part that doesn't make sense.
why would a happily married man kill his wife after she a lost a hundred pounds?
cause he liked her just the way she was.
when he was the only man who paid her any attention.
Thanks.
trace evidence section found gunshot residue on Judith Barnett's crop top.
Jane, this changes everything.
now I need to notify Dr. Crosby of my findings.
although the stab wounds are significant injuries, given what I know now,
I'm revising my initial cause of death to gunshot wound.
it's time we had a talk with Alan Barnett.
thank you for coming in.
I know you must be very busy with your wife's arrangements.
detective Rizzoli and I are very sorry for your loss.
thank you. It has been very hard on me.
she was my friend, my partner, my lover.
she was everything to me.
you two must have had a great life together ...
travel, restaurants, weekends at the cabin.
did you go fishing up there? Hiking?
no. Not much.
no.
no, you wouldn't have.
no, you'd rather watch hiking on your TV.
in your big, soft chair, with Judith right next to you.
that's what we enjoyed. Yeah, but she stopped enjoying it, didn't she?
then she joined tough broad, got in shape, lost the weight, and good-looking men started paying attention to her.
big, strong men.
men like Luis and Mickey.
of course. She looked great.
and that made you happy.
it made her happy. That's what we want for our loved ones.
what a generous little man you are.
Hey! - Well, considering that your wife started a new life that you were no longer a part of.
my wife loved me. She would never leave me.
you were watching TV alone. Going to the cabin alone.
you two no longer had anything in common because she'd already left.
No! I would never have allowed ...
am I being placed under arrest?
you're free to go, Dr. Barnett. - Of course I am.
because you have a theory but no evidence.
I'm not much of a fisherman. Neither are you.
you've got nothing. And that's all you'll ever have.
he thinks he's smarter than us.
maybe he is. - Bullshit.
Where's Frankie? - We're meeting him in break.
you got something? - Yeah.
I had Susie take a blood sample from the patient that Alan was with the morning of his wife's murder.
ketamine? The animal tranquilizer?
according to Maura, dentists use it.
but an elderly patient like Mrs. Gold should be administered a very low dose.
she had a detectable level of ketamine still in her system.
48 hours after her surgery.
Mrs. Gold was really out of it of ketamiwhen we saw her.
Yeah, he knocked her out and gave himself the perfect window of opportunity.
strike one. I found the best route from Alan's office to his house.
no traffic cameras, no homeland security cameras.
15 minutes each way. Okay.
so, the handyman was scheduled to arrive at Alan's house while he was performing the gum graft.
but Judith had to be dead by then for the plan to work.
but she couldn't have been killed before he left for work or that would skew the time of death.
the receptionist said Alan was in with Mrs. Gold when she got there at 8: 00. Her appointment was 6: 30.
so, he worked on Mrs. Gold, made sure she was completely anesthetized, left at 7: 00?
this is me on the route to his house. He gets there at 7: 15.
pulls on a Tyvek suit, gloves and a mask, shoots Judith before she can kick his ass, and then stabs her with the knife that he stole from the handyman.
he drops the knife for us to find, takes off the Tyvek suit, heads for the office. 7: 40?
Yeah, but he's still got to get rid of the gun and the bloody Tyvek suit.
I had some uniforms look through all the dumpsters and trash barrels.
public works searched the storm drains and sewers. Nothing.
Yeah, he's too smart to leave anything close to the crime scene.
I know where Alan got rid of the gun and the Tyvek suit.
strike two!
thank you.
I'll take that.
you can't just ... - We called your courier service.
they said you were expecting a delivery.
you have no right. - This gives us that right.
when you absolutely, positively have to have it overnight.
which you did. Ruger, Bearcat, . 22 caliber.
it was a slick move, mailing yourself the only evidence that'll tie you to your wife's murder.
all you had to do was throw the gun in the nearest lake and burn the Tyvek suit in the woods.
pretty smart. - But not smart enough. Strike three.
at least I'm to scale.
you are so, so not to scale. Look at those things on your chest.
those things are perfect in form and balance.
look at you. You're all leg.
well, I'm exactly to scale because, you know, Susie doesn't guess.
well, she does now. Ooh, here she comes.
Hello, senior criminalist Chang. Very nice to see you, Susie.
Dr. Isles, detective. You both look nice tonight.
what? Did ... she didn't even notice.
you had your right arm up a bit more. - I was not.
you weren't ... you weren't bending your foot right.
I don't bend my feet. Objects in the die-o-rama appear bigger than they are.
well, hers. - Which ones?
general comment. Angela talked to you.
Yeah. That's why I'm here. - Me too.
I was thinking, when I go to next year's convention, you should come with me.
will they have "autopsy jeopardy!"? Yeah.
then I'm gonna schedule surgery for that weekend.
Hey, look who's back in town.
Hi. Hi, honey. - Hi, Ma. Mwah.
Hey, aren't you two a little too old to be playing with dolls?
what? We brought them for Frankie.
Oh, you're a riot, Janie.
Hello, Boston! Hello.
uh, tonight's a very special night.
I'm gonna do some songs my grandfather wrote, the way they were meant to be sung and the way they were meant to be played.
ladies and gentlemen, I am Bobby.
and I'm Vince.
Whoo! - Whoo! All right.
and tonight, we are Bobby & Vince.
Whoo! - Nice!
Thanks.
Exterior's well-kept.
yard's in good shape.
cleaners need to be brought in for full top-to-bottom service.
there's a strong, musty odor that needs to be investigated.
possible leak.
power in the basement is out. Probably just a breaker.
no visible signs of water damage.
odor is significantly stronger down here, Where there is a...
wine room.
approximately 15 by ...
Hi, there. - Tasha?
she's okay. She had a very good surgeon, and she came through with flying colors.
I wouldn't move around too much. Your spleen, kidneys, and liver are bruised.
the baby? - I'm so sorry, Jane.
I'm sure that...
I don't... - Yeah.
everyone's been by ...
and your mom's been here the whole time. She just went home to take a shower.
she's gonna be very upset you woke up when she was gone.
I'll fake sleeping when I hear her coming.
what is that? - A baseball bouquet from Jack.
they're all Grover Verben.
it's his great-uncle. Jack has hundreds of them.
so he didn't pay $500 for the... - No.
he thought you could give them out as "thanks for visiting" gifts.
that's a very... odd idea. - I know.
you guys are perfect for each other.
Dr. Isles.
okay, go ahead and take the photographs and ask a technician to collect the vitals.
I'll be there as soon as I can. Okay. Yes, I'll talk to you soon.
Maura ... - I know what you're going to say.
I have a job to do. - You have a job to do.
go to the crime scene.
I'll be fine. - You'll be fine.
I'm sure you will.
but that person isn't gonna be any less dead if I wait just for a little bit.
a panda needs to consume ... - Find your true love.
here's a special important ...
Hi, sweetheart.
I know you're faking.
what, did you go to a carnival? - Isn't it adorable?
it's... big. - It's a "hug me tight" teddy bear.
I wanted you to have something to hold when I'm not here.
I thought you might be hungry. I made you a sandwich.
white bread and cheese.
it's what you always wanted when you stayed home sick from school.
I was thinking more hot wings.
no. How about a little gin rummy?
I don't know, Ma. - Afraid I'll beat you?
you haven't beaten me since I was in grade school.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna take advantage of your weakened state.
all right.
everything's gonna be okay.
yeah? How do you know that? - Because I've been there.
what does that mean?
I had a miscarriage about a year before you were born.
Oh, Ma, I never knew that.
I kept it to myself. That's what we did. - Was pop there for you?
I think it was hard for him to understand how I felt.
how did you feel? - Sad.
devastated.
I was also confused. I-I couldn't understand how I could have such a sense of loss for something that I never really had.
I think you should share how you're feeling with somebody.
Yes. I just don't think I'm ready to talk about it yet.
you'll know when the time is right.
come on. Play cards with me.
I'm feeling very lucky.
Jane's doctor said she should be able to leave the hospital by the end of the week.
how are her spirits? - Well, when I left, she made me promise to call her and fill her in on the case.
sounds like she's already feeling better. I hope so.
you were right. This body is beautifully preserved.
I don't think I said "beautifully." I'm pretty sure I compared her to beef jerky.
and this is the perfect environment to preserve it ...
cool, dry, just like the Egyptians created for their mummies.
I never understood why they went to all the trouble.
so their eternal spirits could recognize their earthly bodies after death.
why couldn't they just keep it simple and wear funny hats?
I don't think simple was their objective. They went to great lengths for their preparations.
for instance, did you know that the brain was pulled out through the nasal passages with a special hooked wire?
no. Kind of wish I didn't know it now.
well, there are no visible external injuries ...
no entrance wounds, blunt-force trauma, or blood loss.
no, and nothing we found in the house points to foul play.
makes me wonder if she died of natural causes.
with this much decay, how long will it take to make a determination?
well, it took me five seconds. This woman didn't die of natural causes.
she was poisoned.
she looks like I feel after sitting at my desk all day.
maybe you need to get up and stretch more often.
duly noted. Any idea how long she's been dead?
well, it's difficult to say. More than 2 years, less than 10.
is that based on the dryness of the corpse? No ... the collar of her shirt.
that was a very popular style in the mid-aughts.
who says fashion doesn't have a place in forensics? Certainly not me.
you gonna be able to tell what poison was used with her tissue samples?
no. Uh, even though the skin was intact, the organs inside the body liquefied and, over time, turned to dust.
so we're screwed? - Not quite.
the diptera larvae ... the maggots ...
they feasted on the victim's flesh, died of the same poison before they morphed into flies.
so you are...? - Making a maggot milkshake.
I've collected the maggots' tissue, casings, and feces, so I can extract trace elements of poison.
I hope you didn't bring that blender from home.
What?! - I said I hope ...
never mind.
this is a nice room. You can rest, watch baseball on TV...
...play along with the game shows.
you suck at small talk. - I don't know what to say.
you okay? - I'm fine.
really ... you don't have to worry about me.
what kind of brother would I be if I didn't worry about you?
Oh, Janie.
I'm so sorry.
what can I do?
why don't you tell me about the case? - Yeah. Yeah, okay.
uh... our victim's name is Fran Clark, 38 years old, single female.
cause of death was poisoning.
did you figure out when she died? - 4 12 years ago.
what? One day, she's using her phone and credit cards.
the next day, she wasn't. How did the body stay undetected for that long?
all of her bills are on Autopay, her lights are on timers, mail went to a P. O.Box, a gardener takes care of her yard.
she didn't have anybody that noticed she was missing?
no friends, family, co-workers? No, the neighbors said she kept to herself.
and according to some messages I found on her answering machine from her stepfather, she and her mother were estranged.
I'd love to hear those messages. - I thought you'd say that.
Fran, it's Howard. I'm calling again because the cancer's gotten worse.
you two have to patch things up before it's too late.
he left her another message after the mother passed away.
Fran, your mother died this morning. The funeral's on Wednesday.
I know you two had trouble, but come and say goodbye.
I don't want you to regret it later. Any sign that she went?
I guess we'll find out. The stepfather's coming in.
Hey. - Hey. What are you doing back so soon?
well, I figured out what kind of poison was used, and I figured you were dying to know.
it was Hemlock. - As in ancient Greece?
well, the way that she died ... alone ...
poisoned by something that no one's used since socrates killed himself 2, 000 years ago...
you should have Korsak ask the stepfather - about Fran's mental health. - I'll call him.
thanks for keeping me in the loop. - As if we have a choice.
four years, and nobody noticed?
not that we know of. - Poor thing.
so, Howard, you say you were married to Fran's mother for six years.
Yeah. What were she and her mother fighting about?
my wife never really wanted to talk about it.
I'm not sure I know anything that's gonna be helpful.
look, we need to figure out what happened to Fran.
and although it's not what we would have wanted for her, it's better to know the truth.
are you sure there's nothing you can tell me?
well, I hate to say this, especially now, but I didn't like her.
she was mean, difficult. She broke her mother's heart.
I tried to bring them back together when my wife was on her deathbed, but after she passed away, I never wanted to see Fran again.
I can understand that. - Frankly, I'm not surprised she died.
she never went outside, never got any exercise, survived on frozen food, candy bars, red wine.
what about friends? - None that I knew of.
how about work? On several financial filings, she listed her occupation as "freelance contractor.
she wrote computer code for banks, but she never went to the office.
man.
when you start talking about all this, this is so sad.
I bet there's not one person who misses her.
do you think she was capable of taking her own life?
maybe. I hope not.
may I help you? - Yeah.
uh, can I have Tasha Williams' room number, please? Are you family?
not exactly. - Then I'm sorry.
since Tasha's underage, I can't give out her room number.
okay. Well, um, she's a witness in a homicide investigation, so I need to know her room number - and everything related to her care. - Really?
everything that Detective Rizzoli said is true.
though she might have fudged some causal connections.
218. I'll give you a few minutes, but then she needs her rest.
thank you. You like baseball?
was Ted Kennedy a liberal? - Here.
grover Verben, the Lefty Lion? - Yeah.
why are you giving this to me? Just my way of saying thanks.
for what? - For taking care of Tasha.
this is too much. Mm.
Dr. Yates to surgical step down. Dr. Yates to surgical step down.
um, this is Dr. Maura Isles, - who you spoke to on the phone. - Hello.
what's that thing? - That?
that is a "hug me tight" teddy bear.
you know, in case you get lonely.
I'm not really a hugger. And that's not really a bear.
I didn't want to say anything, but she's right.
it's a panda ... ailuropoda melanoleuca.
which literally translates to "black-and-white cat foot," not "bear foot" ...
more closely related to raccoons than to bears. Yeah, I am afraid not.
a recent national science study of DNA concluded that pandas are actually more closely related to the spectacled bear of South Africa than to raccoons.
maybe. But their skull and dental structures don't resemble bears, their feet don't have heel pads, and they don't hibernate.
so if they are bears, then they're all alone on their own little bear island.
so, we're agreed ... it's part panda, part bear, part raccoon, part cat.
I'm not agreeing to that. - Jane, that is ridiculous.
Yes, it is ... absolutely ridiculous that a stuffed animal could be genetically incorrect.
the real reason we're here is to tell you that you're safe.
we got the guy that was after you.
I... wasn't really worried.
I'm sorry, ladies, but visiting time is over.
that wasn't a few minutes. - Our patient needs her rest.
see you later.
Jane. - Yeah?
thank you for helping me. - You're welcome.
Frankie, what do you got?
we went back and combed through all the victim's Autopay accounts and found something strange.
Fran's gardener, Joe Martin, got a pay raise. Six months after Fran died.
according to the bank, it was entered from her regular I. P. address, using her password.
hemlock is a plant-based poison. And who knows more about plants than a gardener?
we found your fingerprints on Fran's computer.
you gave yourself a raise. Anything else you helped yourself to?
okay, look, I knew she was dead, but I didn't kill her.
you knew she was dead?
Yes. I-I found her that way in the basement.
when? - Uh, four years ago-ish.
I went in to turn the sprinklers off for the winter, and there she was.
she didn't look exactly like that, but she was definitely dead.
so you just forgot to tell someone about it?
I should have, but I was low on cash, so I just figured that I'd wait for the next Autopay money to go through.
then one thing led to another, and... I didn't.
so you could keep collecting the payments?
I figured somebody else would find her.
and since she was dead, you thought you'd just help yourself - to her bank accounts? - No.
look... a few months after I found Fran, my girlfriend kicked me out.
so I moved into the room above the garage. A-and occasionally, I'd go into the house.
and her password was right there by her computer. So I gave myself a raise because I deserved it.
I'd been doing lots of extra work around the house ...
you know, since she couldn't. - Unbelievable.
if you think I killed her for the money, then why didn't I take more?
I had ... I had plenty of time to steal everything.
I liked Fran. She was nice to me.
did you see anyone else at the house before she died?
well, there ... there was this one guy I saw a couple of times.
he's a skinny white dude with a beard.
so, can I go now? - No.
we're gonna leave you here and see if somebody finds you.
detective Rizzoli, this is Cathy Graff, Tasha's social worker.
I informed her you needed to be kept in the loop, uh, since Tasha is a witness in one of your cases.
Yes, um...
we ... we just need to know what social services' plan are so BPD can maintain contact with her.
well, we always like to place children with a family,
but because of Tasha's age and years on the street, adoptive parents and foster families will be suspicious of drugs, prostitution, emotional difficulties.
well ... well, she doesn't have those problems. Still, potential guardians may be suspicious.
well, uh, you could spend five minutes with her, and you know she's a good kid.
that may be true, but this is a complex situation.
there is nothing complex about it. It's very simple.
this is a girl who needs love, guidance, and rules.
I have a girl just like Tasha who is a thriving college freshman.
I'm not saying it's right. I'm just telling you it's the reality of the system.
the likelihood is that Tasha will be placed in a group home with girls of a similar age.
that sucks. - I'm sorry.
I'll call you when we have a placement.
how long is Tasha supposed to stay in the hospital?
a week ... 10 days tops.
thank you.
Hey, Korsak.
I talked to several of the gardener's customers.
they said he was honest, reliable, trustworthy, heck of a good guy.
I've been through all of Fran's bank records.
nothing else is missing. All he took was the extra $25 a month.
well, with the password, he could have cleaned out her accounts.
okay, so maybe he didn't kill her, but not telling anyone she was dead probably disqualifies him from the "heck of a good guy" award.
I tested the wine residue on the glass that we found next to the victim.
the wine that evaporated from that glass was a cheap domestic table wine without a trace of Hemlock in it.
how's that possible?
the killer could have put poison in her glass, then poured it out when she was dead, then cleaned the glass and replaced the good wine with a cheap one he brought with him.
there were 500 bottles of wine in that cellar.
why bring a cheap bottle when you could just open one that was already there?
wine collectors often keep lists of their inventory online.
perhaps the killer was concerned that the bottle would be noticed as missing.
well, at least we finally know one thing for sure ...
somebody concocted an elaborate scheme to make it look like fran died of natural causes.
all we have to do is figure out why.
how's the mutant?
a bit lumpy, anatomically incorrect, and highly flammable.
social services came by today. - I know. She came and talked to me.
I told her I can take care of myself. - Yes, you can.
and you have.
but now that someone like me is involved, you can't do it by yourself ... not anymore.
I don't need your help. - That's not the point.
look, when you turn 18, you can do whatever you want.
but until then, we have to find you someplace to live.
no one wants a kid like me. - Tasha.
if you think that you can stick me in some crappy group home, then you're wrong.
I'll run away again. And this time, you won't find me.
the password we got from the gardener also worked on Fran's smartphone.
remember what the gardener said?
that her only friend was a skinny white dude with a beard.
the firewall is for my protection, Bill. It gives me a say in how things are done.
but nothing's getting done, because you've blocked me out!
well, I guess now you'll have to listen to me. Listen, you little bitch, if you don't take that damn firewall down, I'll kill you.
don't push me.
the only thing the gardener got wrong about this guy was that they were friends.
if you don't take that damn firewall down, I'll kill you.
I didn't mean "kill" kill her. - What kind of kill did you mean?
you know, the funny kind. - I'm not laughing.
look, Fran and I worked together at the bank.
she wrote code. I had an idea for an app.
we got into an argument. She locked me out of the program.
I-I got pissed. That's all you see there.
look, I found her like that. I had nothing to do with it.
you found her? - What? No. Uh...
Frankie, we should just let this guy keep talking.
he's doing a fine job of hanging himself. Bill.
we now have a recording of you saying "I found her," which puts you on the scene.
her financial stake in the app gives you motive.
and the nuance of "I didn't do it" is something a jury might not care about.
after the fight on the video, I knew that we couldn't work together.
so I offered her some royalty payments in exchange for notes on code.
it actually worked for a few weeks.
then she stopped sending me notes. - So you went to her house?
well, not at first, but after four months, I started to think that she was mad at me, that ... that she might sue me for breach of contract. That's when I went by.
and found a dead woman in her basement. Did it dawn on you to call someone?
I did. - Who?
I made an anonymous phone call to the police.
And? - Nothing happened.
so you figured, if no one knew she was dead, no one would know that you owed her money?
Yes.
why did it take you four months to check in? I thought Fran was busy doing other things.
and it's not like she needed my money. - What do you mean?
she had money ... a lot of it.
her inheritance.
that guy was telling the truth about the welfare call.
police got an anonymous call, went by the house to check.
everything looked fine. No one answered the door.
well, hard for a mummy to run to the door. How about the inheritance?
Fran's mom had less than $90, 000 in net assets when she died.
she gave it to the stepdad. But Fran's father died seven years ago.
there are no court records of a will, and his lawyer is dead, but he had almost a million dollars in property at the time of his death.
no other relatives? - None that I've found.
well, that money had to go somewhere.
we can't find any sign that it went through Fran's accounts.
What'd she do ... turn her dad's estate into "Die Hard" bearer bonds and hide them in the mattress?
and we need to dig into her background, starting from when her father died.
somebody knew she'd gotten a pot of gold. We have to figure out who it is.
how are you feeling today?
Hey. Well, I've beaten my mother 30 consecutive times, so... pretty good.
Yeah. She's cheating. I just don't know how.
well, I spoke to your doctor, and he says you're being a very good patient.
Yeah. I'm hoping for early parole based on good behavior.
gin.
have you checked under her pillow for a secret deck?
whose side are you on? - Mine.
what? Okay. I'll be right there.
you're supposed to stay in bed! - Jane, your mother is right.
you cannot be getting out of bed.
ple... - Jane, where are you going?
fran bought a plane ticket two months after her father's death.
plenty of time to get control of her inheritance.
where was she headed? - The Caymans. She stayed 24 hours.
if you're on vacation, you stay longer than that.
it's a stop-and-drop. - Yeah. And I found the hotel.
the room was comped by the Grand Cayman National Bank.
how are we gonna get a subpoena for an offshore bank?
got to get a federal judge and some evidence of a violation of international banking law.
it's not gonna be easy.
is it still wire fraud if you don't actually send the money?
thank you for calling Grand Cayman National Bank. How can I help you?
I need my account balance, but it's kind of embarrassing ...
I've forgotten my account number. What's the name and the address on the account?
fran Clark. 2020 Bingham Drive, Boston.
your password, please?
7, 9, capital "G," 2, 0, "p," hashtag, 11.
at today's current rate of exchange, the balance in that account is $878, 529. 17.
is there anything else I can do f you, Ms. Clark?
no. Thank you.
and that's why you shouldn't have the same password for all your accounts.
how long has she been gone? - I don't know.
what about the security cameras? - I've got people watching every door, and we've reviewed the tapes from every exit since she was last seen. There's been no sign of her.
okay, um, can you check the stairwells, unoccupied rooms, and ... and supply closets?
we're looking everywhere.
you need to check all the delivery services and see if they had trucks here at the hospital.
she could have climbed inside one of those.
I'll get someone on it. - Thank you.
Korsak is sending patrol units to search around the hospital.
I spooked her. - No, you were trying to help.
same result.
look, there are a lot of people looking for her. She won't get far.
should we go back to your room?
no. And ... and ... and you got to get back to work.
no, I-I-I don't. - Yeah, you do. Go.
okay. Um, I'll come back tonight?
okay.
how'd you find me?
well, it was pretty smart ...
knowing that security would be watching the doors.
stay hidden down here until they stopped.
you're good at your job aren't you?
most days.
not today, when I came to talk to you about social services.
I need to get a doctor to check you out, make sure you're okay. I'm okay.
that's not exactly the medical assessment I was hoping for.
look...
out on the street, I've kept my grades up.
if I could just...
if I could just graduate high school,
I could get a job ... maybe go to college.
but if I get stuck in some group home, it'll be impossible.
I'm not gonna let some group home full of girls screw up your GPA.
I promise.
but I need you to trust me.
please.
I'm not gonna let you down, baby.
I can't find anyone who knew about the inheritance.
what about the stepfather? - Said he couldn't help.
he married the mom after Fran got the money. But I called the neighbors, trying to find someone who knew - her mom back then. - Any luck?
Yeah, the lady down the block said that she and Fran's mom were good friends.
she told me what a wonderful woman she was and that it was a real shame ...
she looked like she was getting better, then died suddenly.
suddenly? I thought she died of cancer.
well, that's what we heard. I called her doctor.
he wouldn't talk to me. Did you have better luck?
the threat of an official visit from the medical examiner works every time.
Yeah. Who wants you sitting in their waiting room, right?
no. Not ... not "you.
it's ... it's ... it's the office.
okay. I get it. I get it. - It's ... it's ... it's ...
so, our victim's mother had stage IV lung cancer. When traditional drugs failed, she was accepted into a trial for a new A. L.K. inhibitor. It worked.
she went into remission, and the doctor thought that she would have a meaningful recovery.
but she didn't? - No.
she died unexpectedly two weeks later. - Was there an autopsy?
since she was a cancer patient and under a doctor's care, there was no autopsy, and her husband had her cremated the next day.
so the stepfather killed the mom, too?
first, he killed Fran, thought he'd get all the money when his wife died.
but then her remission meant she wasn't dying fast enough, so he felt like he didn't have any choice.
well, I don't know what you were thinking.
if your stitches had opened up, you could have bled to death before Detective Rizzoli had found you.
but I didn't. - By the grace of god.
but since you've shown that you clearly don't have any sense, we're gonna have to keep an eye on you night and day.
careful.
take your meds.
Cathy, it's Detective Jane Rizzoli. Uh, we were talking about Tasha Williams.
Yes, um, I have a question.
what does it take for a single woman to become a foster parent?
I guess if you have a reclusive step daughter and a dying wife, that 800 grand seems like easy pickings.
Ah, what are the odds of two people tripping over the same body and not doing anything about it?
well, if he hadn't have killed his wife, we might never have known.
the problem is, we can't prove any of it.
what if we got the wife's ashes? Would that have forensic value?
cremation requires temperatures in excess of 1, 100 degrees, and that destroys DNA, so even if you could detect some pathogen, you wouldn't be able to say it came from the mother's body.
we'll just have to just keep grinding away at it. We'll get something, eventually... hopefully.
that "hopefully" made you sound a little less confident.
can I have pizza?
Yes, when the doctor clears you for solid foods. I had a sandwich today.
your mother? - Yeah.
well, I hope it was delicious, because if it causes a blockage, you will not be happy.
I got it.
a blockage? - No.
an idea of how to throw a monkey wrench into Howard's plan.
Mr. Ames. - Oh.
thanks for coming in. - Of course.
we're done with our investigation, and we've concluded that Fran was poisoned.
there's no evidence to suggest that it was at someone else's hand, so...
we think she committed suicide. I'm sorry.
thank you.
our investigation is done, but you'll likely be contacted by an investigator from Grand Cayman Bank.
the Caymans? - She had an account there.
well, what do they want to talk to me about?
we can't officially close our investigation because we couldn't find any financial or chemical evidence that Fran was in possession of the poison.
Cayman law requires a clear cause of death before they'll allow transfer of assets to an estate.
because we can't provide one, their policy is to send in their own investigator before they deny the transfer.
okay.
I know you and your stepdaughter weren't close, but...
...I'm still very sorry for your loss.
so, they released you? - They did. They sent me home.
but the doctors still have me on a short leash.
and you get released at the end of the week. Yep.
well, you know, there's still that bit of business that we need to take care of before I go ...
that group-home thing.
I think we've found an alternative.
social services has agreed to allow Gwen to be your foster parent,
and she has graciously agreed to take you in.
I've got a daughter who's in college, so I have the room and I have the time.
but there's gonna be some rules. - Rules?
for starters, you have to be home for dinner by 6: 00, unless we've agreed to something different.
okay. - I'm gonna go...
...and let you guys work out the details. I'll see you soon.
Bye, Jane.
homework needs to be done before you surf the net or watch TV.
of course. And I know that you're old enough to date, but only on the weekends and only if I've met them first.
it's gonna be great.
you got greedy, Howard.
this isn't an active crime scene. You can't be here.
actually, the bank owns the house, and they said we could come in.
technically, you're breaking and entering.
Frankie, you mind looking in that bag?
look at this, Korsak. He's trying to provide the investigators with the evidence they need to prove Fran's suicide.
I'm sure you'll find traces of Hemlock in that bag, too, which would be okay, if we'd told you what killed her.
read him his rights. Howard Ames, you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
okay. I put your stuff in a drawer. - Thank you.
and I bought you some of that shampoo you like ...
you know, the one with all the fruity-smelling chemicals.
but you said that was like washing my hair with dry-cleaning solution.
Yeah, but it's like fruity-smelling dry-cleaning solution.
it's in the green bathroom.
how's it taste? - It's... cold.
Mm. What? You're having a beer?
well, you're choosing the menu tonight.
I actually like it. - Yeah, no. See, that's how it starts.
I will not be blamed if you start chugging beers and belching the alphabet.
so, how are you doing?
how am I supposed to be doing?
I have no idea. - Yeah, me neither.
who's that? - Probably your family.
Ohh. I don't know if I'm ready for all of them to pile in here and try to make me feel better.
I just wanted to relax and ...
feel like everything's heading back to normal again.
okay. Well, I'll tell them. I'm sure they'll understand.
Hi. - Hail, hail. The gang's all here.
Hey! - Hey, Janie.
we got pizza now. You can have pizza, right?
I forgot the key. - The game's already on, - so we're gonna watch. - Look who I found!
come on, get it on. What channel's it on here?
it's 12. It's 12. - 4 or 12.
janie, can you get me an opener?
someone put lead in your shoes? No. Get it yourself.
should I tell them to go?
we got anchovies. - You did not!
they look disgusting. - Yes!
Nyah!
get in here. - All right.
where are they? - Get your pizza.
they're just awful. - The spin on that!
Ugh! Get off me. - Oh! Please!
this guy can hit. Oh, come on!
and strike 3 called.
Yeah, if you're a farmer's wife.
ma, come on. My birthday was last month.
it's fine.
well, we're not leaving until we find something that we both like.
did you bring food and water?
all right. Do me a favor. Try this one on.
no ! let me see.
every girl needs a little black dress.
not me. I...got vaccinated to black dress.
come on!
let me see it.
that is one stunning
little black dress is so nice.
and, Jane?
you look beautiful.
mom, where am I gonna wear this?
a murder at the Boston pops?
okay, we're not leaving until we buy it.
okay, okay. Fine. Get the damn dress.
it'll look fabulous in my closet.
thank you.
Hey. Mom! Knock! Come on!
what? Like I haven't seen that before?
okay, frost. I'll meet you there.
okay.
Yeah.
no, no. I'll be right there.
all right.
I love you.
no, not... no, not you. Bye.
okay. I'll see you later. Okay.
thank you, mom!
damn. Look how young he is.
no obvious signs of injury. It's odd.
listen. I can promise you
that we are working tirelessly for justice in this case.
no, no, no... yeah, "Tirelessly. " Look at him work.
lower your voice,somebody might hear you.
but as you know, uh, Boston has some of the...
I wonder if that guy has, like, a satellite for the news van.
no, he's not a cop. All right?
he's a police officer. He's a climber.
he's an ass!
well, he's got a lot of pulp.
juice." We say, " Guy's got juice.
and you're gonna be drinking yours out of a sippy cup If you don't lower your voice.
who killed this kid? I don't see anything.
there's no... no knife wounds...
no bullet entry or exit wounds.
no external sign of trauma to indicate a beating.
wasn't killed for his stuff.
his school I. D.
15... God.
I'm never having kids.
what do you got for me, Rizzoli?
don't you want to wait for the camera crews?
there's no obvious cause of death.
I'll know more after the autopsy.
Hey, hey. Hey.
don't touch anything in my crime scene, all right?
so as to not contaminate.
right.
you might want to take a look under there.
I'm not finished processing the scene.
well, I bet that you could match those shoe prints to that skateboard.
if you tried.
I'd do it myself,
but I don't want to contaminate your crime scene.
thank you. That's very helpful.
you're welcome.
Bye.
that went well.
find something.
No!
no, no, no, no.
no, no, no.
he didn't come home last night.
I even called his father.
you're divorced?
since he was 10. We are fighting.
over custody of Mathias?
all he wanted to do was skateboard.
I told him it's not safe out there!
he wouldn't listen.
the devil got into my boy.
and left me alone with his curse.
what do you mean "The devil"?
he was not the same after he met those boys!
the skateboarders.
we'll need their names.
I don't know them.
I just know they are bad.
Mrs. Senna...
I understand that you don't trust us right now.
but we want to find your son's killer as badly as you do.
and I promise you we will do everything...
everything we can to find the person who did this.
thank you.
he was all I had.
how much you know about Cape Verde?
you mean, do I have any special insight because I'm black?
Yeah.
the gangbangers I've arrested are usually somewhat suspicious of white female cops.
it's a pretty isolated culture.
uh, not that I really know much.
they think of themself as more creole than black.
this Mathias was a good kid.
he's got no arrests, good grades.
all right, let's look at everything.
pull up sex offenders and predators in the area,
see if anything pops.
got it.
that comment from his mother.
made about the devil getting into her son...
let's see if there's any tie to local gangs, devil worshipping.
and we narrow it down to skateboarders.
nice. I'll check with Bric.
you see Korsak?
coffee shop.
again?
Hey, Korsak. Shh!
would you like coffee, Detective?
no, thank you.
who's she?
new.
what are you doing here?
working... on my testimony for the O'Reilly murder.
I'm up tomorrow.
Yeah, but why are you working here?
uh...It was cold at my desk.
all right. How's the trial looking?
bunch of idiots on the jury who watch too much TV.
waiting for the presto-bango magic DNA.
Yeah.
listen. You still got your connection at family court?
okay, I got a juvie victim named Mathias senna.
what do you need me for?
well, I need to know now what is in that custody hearing.
Oh, sure. I'm not doing anything.
Thanks.
and switch to decaf.
lungs are congested and heavy,
but overall organs appear normal.
so what's the cause of death here?
I don't have one.
mees lines...
possible indicators of toxins in his system.
so he was poisoned? Mm. Doubtful.
a few pinpoint petechial hemorrhages Could indicate asphyxia.
so he was suffocated.
no airway obstruction or external indication Of strangulation.
Hello? Cause of death.
do you think lieutenant Grant was sexy?
you know, in a male kind of way?
do you like him?
not my type.
you know, I'll do a tox screen on arsenic and heavy metals...
both of which can cause mees lines.
you just said he wasn't poisoned, Maura.
I said it was doubtful,
based on the evidence.
God, woman.
grant is a brass-kisser.
even when we were young,
he had all the nuns wrapped around his little finger.
Oh, I'll erase the board for you, sister Mary pat.
at recess, he would yell out, "Roly-poly Rizzoli eats cannoli.
Oh, you were overweight?
no. I was athletic.
maybe I was a little chubby.
Why? What'd they call you?
Maura, the bore-a.
you know.
they meant "Boring," But it doesn't rhyme.
do you think maybe I was?
what is that?
crime lab confirmed the presence of candle wax.
what? Hold your questions.
these dark particles?
those are burned feathers.
okay, let me guess.
he was smothered with a burning down pillow While...He drank candle wax.
no.
Maura, I know it makes you break out into hives If you have to guess,
but I need a theory, okay?
just... just one.
the medical evidence is consistent With what I would expect to find
if the victim went through an exorcism.
he was killed by an exorcism?
I didn't say that.
the dad's not religious. It's the mom's church.
it's a storefront.
well, it may not look like a church,
but it's an urban crystallization of a larger American pattern of religious choice.
Yeah.
it's also a good scam.
even the drive-thru chapels are tax-exempt.
well, commercial spaces can still be sacred.
this is the guy who runs it.
father Osorio Kokou,
leader of the Cidade Velha church.
born "Reginald Perry..."
in and out of jail since he was a kid.
robbery, assault.
Oh, check fraud.
started his church while he was on parole.
so he's raking it in,
exorcism goes bad, he dumps the boy's body.
excuse me. This is an awful lot of speculation.
it's a theory. It's different.
besides, who in this day and age is performing exorcisms?
well, the catholic church has been performing exorcisms
since the second century, and they still do.
it's an effective ritual for expelling demons.
good to know.
this is father Kokou, my priest.
hello. Jane: Hello.
we're investigating the death of Mathias.
did you perform an exorcism on him?
we performed purification rituals on the boy.
Yes.
and did you "Purify" him the night he disappeared ?
father Kokou would never hurt Mathias.
he was helping.
exorcisms are very powerful.
is that what she said?
no.
is that what you said?
no.
I said " May God give his soul rest.
and she thanked me by saying " Stay in God's peace.
we were fighting hard for Mathias.
the devil was strong in him.
and the devil killed him.
see, we don't think the devil killed him.
we think Mathias may have been killed by an exorcism.
think? So you don't know.
you're good, Reginald.
we're not finished.
thanks for stopping by.
this is a house in mourning.
it's time for you to go.
Beatrice, that's up to you.
please do as the priest said.
the forces of evil are powerful.
I can handle evil.
not this kind.
I was disrespectful?
father "Cuckoo" Back there is my number-one suspect.
father Kokou.
Maura. I was making a point.
well, "Kokou" is the most popular boy's name with cape Verdeans.
okay, I don't need a history lesson. Thank you.
very intriguing culture.
descendants from the Portuguese explorers and slaves from the Cape Verdean islands.
I'm impressed!
I can Google, too.
and that father kokou...
or... or whatever is a phony.
did you check out that poncho he was wearing?
a grand boubou.
I said I know.
Oh, you knew? What that robe was called?
a "Boo-boo"?
well, it's popular With the Christians in west Africa.
though the swahili in east Africa sometimes say their language.
like their boo-boos?
Yes.
that's not funny.
okay.
okay, give me the address.
okay.
I'll see you back at the ranch.
I'm gonna go talk to the boy's father.
I'll get you a boubou.
a "Boo-boo"?
I tried to get Matt away from his mother and that crazy voodoo priest.
I should have just taken him.
do you think that your ex-wife May have had anything to do With Mt's death?
not... not Beatrice. No.
maybe the church.
you did everything you could, Malcolm.
and my son is dead.
when did your ex-wife join the church?
after the divorce.
that priest is a crook.
he got her to give him all of her money,
even the child support.
he spent every last dime on lawyers,
fighting for custody.
I mean, we even put off having our own children...
Alicia, I have a child already.
I know.
I had.
the judge was just about to rule in our favor.
we were gonna bring him home.
get settled, be a family.
dad's story checked out. He was getting full custody.
so maybe the mom killed him.
Yeah, I'll e-mail the whole file to you.
um, I'm guessing she's in the waitress-protection program,
and you're working here because...
you're her new bodyguard.
I'm working a case here, Rizzoli, undercover.
and you're undercover to get her...
Beans-to-water ratio?
someone's been stealing from her till.
I said I'd help her out.
I have a fresh batch of blondies, my mother's recipe.
do you want one?
don't want to insult your mother.
I will insult your mother if it keeps my ass smaller.
I hear ya.
how much is missing?
$11. 01 yesterday. $14. 99 the day before.
Wow. 26 whole dollars.
now I understand why you don't have the time to do homicide cases.
I got a full load here!
and I'm in the middle of a trial.
you got time for blondies.
Oh, you're gonna tell me again how much you hate Grant?
you don't keep your mouth shut,
and I'll go tell her how much you like her.
this is a nasty custody battle.
mom and her church against dad.
something there?
maybe. What do you got?
tracking Matt's friends and, uh, child predators.
okay.
Hey, ma.
look who I found in the lobby.
well, you weren't answering your phone,
and the brand-new officer O'Connor wouldn't let me up.
all right. Well, I'll talk to him. Thanks.
Hey, do you have Matt's autopsy report?
Yes, I'm waiting on tox and micros,
but I can tell you this conclusively.
it was not a natural death. Really?
you could knock me over with a chicken feather.
uh, and what are you doing here?
I brought you the dress that you're going to wear tomorrow when you come to dinner.
it's just the solernos, mom.
so? You cat look nice?
Oh. Look at this. Oh, wow.
look at the detailed ottoman ribbing.
Yeah, it's got that, uh, Grecian v-neck.
Oh, gorgeous woven-edge hem.
Jane. Yeah.
um, listen, when you two are done playing "Project runway,
I got work to do.
I know you always forget to eat.
thank you.
I love you. Love you.
well, look at that.
want some? Is it okay?
Yeah. All right.
look at this.
Oh. What is that white substance?
fluff.
light, downy particles of cotton?
it's marshmallow.
and the brown substance is called peanut butter.
it's ground-up, heavy, oily particles of peanuts.
what, they didn't have that in your fancy boarding school?
Oh, it's really good.
two hits on pedophiles that like Matt's type...
both in custody when he disappeared.
all right, what about his skateboarder friends?
gang unit says Matt was hanging with some bad kids.
ran the names...
they've all been brought up on minor drug charges, except Matt.
this is the gang leader.
A. K.A. Jerome, 18...
and the only adult.
he recruits juveniles on skateboards to run drugs for him?
maybe Matt said no.
the origin of gang names is actually quite fascinating.
a nickname signifies a change in status or identity.
you're not a true member until you have a nickname.
yo, Dr. Death.
Jane needs a cause of death,
not a seminar on gangster nicknames.
maybe there's something to what docter is saying. Thank you.
if Matt had a nickname,
could mean he was in Cruncha's gang.
so maybe it's time to talk to Cruncha.
yo.
do you know this guy?
Yeah, that's, um, that's the homie Ollie right there, man.
we used to skate.
so Ollie was Mathias' nickname?
Yeah, he was, uh, he was bad on the board.
but, uh, I'm done talking to five-oh's.
so you can bother someone else, dude.
you mind, Jane?
I, uh...
didn't make it to the gym today.
Yeah, be my guest.
let me go! Let me go, poosh!
let me go!
I'm not a dude. I'm a Detective.
if you disrespect that, I will hurt you!
you got that?
you got that?!
Yes, I got it! I got it!
now, your boy got killed out here.
look, I ain't killed nobody, man.
you go ask his mother!
crazy cape Verdeans and they - they hexes!
and... they... they evil, man!
them brothers and sisters at that church are off the chain!
so, just let me go, man!
I didn't do nothin', man.
get out. Get out of here.
so, what are you thinking?
my gut says he's right.
church and the priest are evil,
but it's not enough for a warrant.
nice move.
another set of micro and tox reports came back...
all negative.
I could run tox screens every day...
every day for the rest of my life And still not have a cause of death.
gee, that's encouraging.
all right, what about, um, herbs That they use in exorcisms?
can you run those?
Yeah, already on it. It'll be in the next screening.
this is so frustrating. This poor kid!
poor parents.
what is it?
I hate snakes.
you can't take me off this case.
I'm not taking you off the case. Okay?
but you can't ignore a threat like that.
it's a crazy priest and some garden snakes!
come on! Yeah. I understand what it...
Hey, Jane, whoever did this covered the security lens with spray paint.
no prints. Nothing on the tape.
do exorcism priests tag?
Hey. Hey! No jokes.
okay? This is a very dicey political situation.
we cannot be seen as persecuting a priest or the church.
what if he did it?
come on, Joe, is that all you care about,
is how this is gonna affect your career?!
no, what I care about is you going about this in a smart way so it sticks!
so you believe me?
Yes.
get kokou.
just be careful.
okay. Thank you.
yet another tox report that came back negative.
he didn't die from an herb commonly used in exorcisms.
well, look for the uncommon ones.
it's still thousands. We have to narrow it down.
Maura, I can't go after that priest Until I know what Matt died of.
well, I'm not gonna guess.
all right, well, what if you were to guess?
just hypothetically guess.
what would be your guess...
hypothetically?
I found several cases of people in the literature...
who were hexed to death.
Muader by hex.
all right, enough guessing.
well-documented cases.
victims who were so convinced that they were cursed that they suffered
catastrophic catecholamine-induced arrhythmia.
I don't even know what that is.
heart attack.
a heart attack because they were scared?
my kid didn't die of fear.
well...
haven't you ever been afraid of anything?
witches.
my family went to Salem when I was little.
see? You were very impressionable.
Yes, I had to sleep with a night-light.
Why? What were you scared of?
Chromobacterium violaceum.
what's that?
it's a flesh-eating bacteria.
crawls inside your ear or your nose,
and it starts eating you from the in... okay.
I got it.
thank you.
it's horrible.
every culture has an exorcism ceremony.
you know, and there's no law against being a charismatic religious leader.
Yeah, yeah, like Jim Jones and kool-aid
and David Koresh and Waco.
what could go wrong?
I feel like going to church. You?
we're about to do a ceremony.
I'm about to serve a search warrant.
this is a very disruptive way to observe a foreign culture.
well, at least one of us will fit in.
you could have told me you had a warrant.
she didn't.
we didn't have time.
you lied?
no.
I said I was about to serve a warrant.
I didn't say when.
your rituals could seem as strange to others as ours do to you.
blood into wine,
bread into flesh.
he's right.
it's no different than the poteau-mitan,
linking heaven and hell.
is it?
you know about the poteau-mitan?
you were in doctors without borders?
why can't you just say that?
please.
let us complete the ceremony,
help sister Beatrice.
then you can do your search.
only if we can observe.
if you wish.
don't worry.
no. Why worry?
we're just locked in a room with an ex-con Who's about to do an exorcism.
this is great.
snakes!
Sna... shh!
she believes the devil that possessed her son is inside of her.
think of an exorcism as a...
as a massive therapeutic intervention.
weapon.
passed from her son's heart to her!
get everybody out the back! Go!
out of the back! Let's go! Let's go!
stop!
Where'd you get the sweatshirt?
my homie Ollie gave it to me.
right before you put a pillow over his head And smothered him to death?
look, I'm... I'm a skater, not a killer.
that's cute, Jerome.
you just threw a Molotov cocktail at a cop.
you think you can scare the cops off this case with some snakes and firebomb?
what are you talking about snakes, man?
brother ain't messing with no damn snakes.
and the firebomb?
look, the voodoos killed Ollie.
I want a lawyer.
okay, we're done.
take him to lockup.
he has kids do petty crimes to cover for his ass,
but he throws a revenge bomb himself?
no. He didn't kill him.
so you make the priest for it?
Oh, big daddy voodoo isn't saving souls.
I haven't ruled out the parents, either.
damn it. I am late for dinner.
my mom's gonna kill me!
you were firebombed, Jane.
it's a good excuse!
Yeah. You don't know my mother.
will you call her and tell her I'm on my way?!
okay?!
Yeah.
come on.
Hi, ma. Hi!
I'm sorry.
no worries. Mwah! I'm glad you're here.
like it? Yeah.
okay. Okay.
help me out? Go entertain. Okay.
okay, okay, okay.
wow, you look amazing.
thank you.
what the hell, ma?
Where's pa and the solernos?
they went to go pick up ice cream for later!
no, they didn't.
there's no one else here?
I made ragu bolognese.
you made me wear this dress for Joe Grant?!
what? No!
I don't know what you're talking about.
ma!
I need to know you're taken care of.
by him?
are you kidding?! He's cute!
he's not cute! He's very cute.
so what?!
go! You go!
be a girl!
I love you.
so, I, uh, haven't seen you in a dress Since, what, senior prom?
with Charlie Krenz.
he was a dork.
Yeah, he was a dork.
what, are you gonna tell me I've filled out nicely?
and risk being brought up on, uh, harassment charges?
maybe.
you look good.
I had no idea she was inviting you.
she didn't invite me. I broke in the window.
Yeah, you always were funny. Yeah.
thank you.
you're welcome.
how did she convince you to do this?
your mom? You kidding me?
she, uh, she wouldn't take no for an answer.
she told me it was a reunion or something.
Yeah, apparently. Yeah.
so, I, uh
heard about your little incident at the church.
you gonna write me up?
maybe.
you gonna write me up, uh, for harassment?
maybe.
but you'd have to do it first.
I think you look perfect.
thank you.
you are welcome
dinner's almost ready!
set the table, Jane!
okay!
I can't believe my mother.
Yeah. It's just the two of us, right?
Yeah.
my mother still... Oh...
Yeah.
my mother still likes to tell me when it's gonna rain outside.
that's why I bring an umbrella, you know?
Yeah.
no, no. She... you know, she just wants you to be happy. That's all.
well, no offense, but I don't need a guy to make me happy.
and no one's proposing here, so...
what's that supposed to mean?
this is a bad idea, huh?
Yes. Yes.
it is a bad idea.
all right. Well... Okay.
tell your mother I said hi.
tell her yourself.
why are you laughing?
no, I mean, Se... do I look stupid?
no. Are you kidding?
really, you don't know?
you're gorgeous, my friend.
then why are you laughing?
Really? Okay. Well...
tell my mother that.
she thinks I'm some sort of pity project.
she just loves you. That's all.
want some cheese?
no.
no. Not out of the dead fridge. No.
if she loves me so much,
why did she hand me off to that creep?
I don't believe you think he's a creep.
well, I do.
I've known him since he was 5. You know he used to lisp.
so?
so?
you get rid of guys if they have receding gums.
that's true. That is true.
but you're always complaining that the guys you date Don't understand or like your job,
and he respects you.
stop.
really.
you think he's this political animal,
but it's just that it comes out of him
when he's around you because he wants to impress you.
it's mating behavior.
I think it's sweet.
I think you're insane.
I'm off to solve a murder.
night-light on or off?
on.
I can't wait till we solve this one.
thank you.
it's in there.
there are almost always explanations for these phenomena.
almost?
well, maybe the dog knocked the flowers over.
Maura, it's four feet off the floor.
Hey, you know, maybe ghosts are real.
maybe I could pick the winning lottery numbers today.
maybe I am losing my mind.
I could do a brain scan if you like.
thank you. That's very helpful.
Thanks.
can you run one more tox panel?
okay.
what do you want me to look for?
I can't even believe I'm saying this.
okay?
purple poisonous plants.
purple?
Yeah.
you said that Mathias was holding purple flowers. Yeah.
monkshood is a purple flowering plant That grows in Boston.
is it poisonous?
Yes.
and it works very quickly,
and it's extremely hard to detect.
but I can try.
tox report on monkshood... Positive.
low levels were detected,
but enough to determine the cause of death.
Mathias was poisoned.
I know why I had that dream,
because I know where I've seen that plant before.
can you type the genetics of the monkshood in Matt's body
and match it to the plant that it came from?
no.
can you lie about that?
no. I don't lie.
well, it's not a lie.
well, yes, it is.
I know when it is. I start to hyperventilate.
okay, it's a white lie.
it's still a lie.
you've never lied to a guy
and tell him he was good when he wasn't?
no.
like this shirt with this jacket?
not really. No.
we're sorry to tell you, but your son was poisoned.
what? How?
actually, with a... A plant like this one right here.
I didn't poison my son.
that church.
beatrice's crazy church.
that's how they did it.
we don't think so.
what's interesting is that, uh,
Dr. Isles can type the genetics of plants,
which means she can match the monkshood That was found in Matt's body
to the plant that it originally came from.
isn't that right, Dr. Isles?
Yes. We do do genetic typing.
basically, someone would just have to soak the monkshood in a bottle of water.
find Matt on his skateboard. Offer him a drink.
that's right.
this is crazy.
if...if I may.
Malcolm wouldn't have a child with you.
is that right?
wait. How do you know that?
it's in your custody papers.
it's one of the reasons that the judge gave you Matt.
it's because of your commitment to him.
there you have it. Right?
he didn't do it.
Yeah, you... you didn't want another child. You had Matt.
but you wanted one of your own, didn't you?
you knew that Malcolm was winning the custody battle.
and you knew it was never gonna happen.
no.
no.
you knew about the exorcisms because of the custody dispute,
and you figured that the church and his mom would be blamed.
you know she never would have stopped fighting for custody.
and we would have spent all our money on the lawyers,
and it just was trapping us in the past,
and I swear, Malcolm, I swear, I did it for us.
No!
Hey! Hey! No!
Mr. Senna! Mr. Senna, okay!
No! No! Come on! Mr. Senna!
Malcolm, I'm sorry.
calm down.
you have the right to remain silent. Calm down, sir.
anything you say can and will be held against you... Malcolm.
...in a court of law.
your mother tell you it was gonna rain?
Naw.
your mom?
no.
how long you been sitting here?
you're soaked.
longer than I expected.
I got to leave for D. C.
soon.
just wanted to come by and see you before I left.
say bye if that's okay.
what's in D. C?
big job I wasn't expecting.
wait , they appoint you to the supreme court or something?
no.
not that big.
they appointed me to be a liaison between the city of Boston and homeland security.
Ah, that is big.
guess I'll be out of your hair now.
that's cool. I mean...
you know...
for you.
right.
sorry I called you "Frog face"
what about "Roly-poly Rizzoli"?
Yeah, that too.
I liked you.
Really? Yeah.
for a long time.
I mean, like.
a really, really, really long time.
you're leaving.
Yeah.
well, have fun in Washington.
I'll miss you.
immediate attraction is pure narcissism.
Oh, I don't agree.
look, they're talking about his t-shirt.
it takes quite a lot of effort to attract a mate.
that right there is the beginning of true love.
people are attracted to people who are attracted to them.
well, there goes that theory.
something tells me we're not getting in much of a run.
Hey, Russ. What do we got?
Russ: hey, Rrizzoli. How you doing? Got a floater.
when did you pull him out? - 20 minutes ago.
how long's he been in?
well, it's hard to tell once the body has been in the water for over an hour.
couldn't find an i. d.
we don't need an i. d.
Maura... You know him?
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.
it's Adam fairfield.
I was, uh, I was involved with his brother Garrett.
of the fairfields?
was it serious?
I was 20. Everything felt serious.
look at the back of his head.
Yeah, it's common with drowning victims.
most likely from getting struck against the rocks.
you want to go with me when I notify the family?
no.
but I will. I owe him that.
holy crap.
well...
the castle in Scotland is much bigger.
place on the cape is beautiful, too.
you could've been a fairfield. How do we not know this?
could you stop saying that?
this is a spyker! C8 laviolette.
that's 400 horses up under there.
I've only seen these in magazines.
Garrett's here. He's always liked the finer things in life.
Yeah. He liked you.
I should have known. Somebody like the mayor beat us to it.
nothing happens in Boston without the Brahmin families knowing about it.
right. Brahmins.
upper... crust.
is that the manifest from the may flower?
look -- Balthazar fairfield.
is that him?
made his money like all the first families.
right, from shipping?
yeah -- Rum, wine, slaves.
they don't seem to rember that part of their history.
the Brahmans have been Boston's social elite for centuries.
they live conservatively.
it would be considered class? To flaunt your wealth.
this isn't flaunting?
well, considering that they're billionaires, no.
I'm so sorry.
I hear you're running the medical examiner's office now.
this is, uh, Jocelyn Adam's wife.
I'm so sorry about Adam.
at least he was doing what he loved.
uh, what was that? - Sailing.
I - I can't believe he drowned.
we can't be sure that's what happened.
we're gonna need a description of the boat.
I think we should notify the Boston harbor and the coast guard.
who are you?
Jane, can this wait?
no.
I'm detective Rizzoli. This is detective frost, Boston homicide.
homicide? Why?
we look into all unattended deaths.
when was the last time you saw your husband?
they're just being thorough.
last night. He left very early.
do you know if he was wearing a life jacket?
never. He said he could sail before he could ride a bike.
I'm so sorry.
thank you for coming.
detectives...
I'm Robert Colburn, legal counsel for the fairfield estate.
thank you for coming so quickly.
of course.
the family would like to cooperate in any way they can.
get me any questions you have in writing, and I will respond to them in 24 hours.
that's not really how we operate.
well, I'm sure you can understand that the family is
excuse me.
I flew in for the foundation gala.
I can't believe it's gonna be a memorial now.
Maura. This must be Garrett.
I'm sorry, Mr. Fairfield. I was explaining to the detectives
that it's critical we get statements as quickly as possible.
isn't that right, Maura?
well, I'm sure the family will be more than happy to answer all of your questions as soon as they're ready.
I don't even have a cause of death.
we should just give them their space.
space? How much space do they need?
Yeah, maybe we can, uh, set up some interviews over the next few days.
do you not get it? They're not setting up interviews.
quit looking at the car!
that's not a car. That's a work of art.
Yeah, you're a tool.
do you get tired in the afternoon?
forget where your keys are, your phone?
well, polynesian people are among the healthiest and happiest people on the planet.
now science knows why.
and it comes in a bottle.
how long has this been going on?
a while.
I got the two-bottle special.
Oh. Your mother's really a good saleswoman.
if you buy now, I'm offering a two-for-one special.
come here, ma. Come on.
excuse me one second. My son.
what? - What are you doing?
I'm the authorized sales associate for the polynesian anti-aging lychee fruit flush.
did you know that polynesians were among the healthiest
since when are you doing this?
since it single-handedly cured Carla talus's colitis.
Carla talucci? - Yeah.
the only woman in the neighborhood who actually fell for the nigerian bank scam?
take a bottle on me.
take it three times a day with meals.
it'll change your life.
do you have to do this here, ma?
the people here will be astonished at the change in their lives
digestion, bowel movements
ma!
what?
just bring this to Jane.
maybe it will help both of you with your irritability.
the body of Adam fairfield was found floating early this morning in Boston harbor.
now, fairfield was only 42 years old, but he was the head of the fairfield empire, a collection of Boston-based corporations, financial institutions, philanthropic groups, things like that.
he was also, though, a member of one of the oldest, most...
why are you doing the autopsy on a Sunday?
did they cancel all the kundalini-pulao-riku yoga classes?
kundalini is sacred energy work, pulao is a savory rice dish, and I'm pretty sure that you made up that last word.
well, I'm sorry i'm not as educated as you and your deluxe friends.
thanks for the support with them, by the way.
their brother just died.
I'm sorry I couldn't stand there and just let you badger his family.
badger?
is that how you describe how I do my job?
and since when do you rush the science? - I'm not rushing anything.
you're scrambling to finish out the autopsy.
the governor called. He would like the reports right away.
of course he did. Did you have a nice chat?
maybe tonight you could attend the opera with some senators, and then afterwards go out on the veranda and smoke big rolled-up wads of $100s.
these people are not the enemy. - Yeah, neither was Columbus.
tell that to the native Americans he killed with smallpox.
the fairfields helped build this city.
my grandfather was an iron worker. He helped build this city.
okay, so -- so what are we arguing about here, history or are you just mad at me for who my friends are?
this is about work. Okay?
I - I've just never seen you hugging suspects before.
we don't even know what happened here.
if this was an accidental drowning, there are no suspects.
so you're hoping it's an accident.
are you hoping it was a murder?
I'm doing my job like I always do. Why don't you do yours?
I am. And as a medical examiner, it is my job to determine the cause and the manner of death, so I'll tell you whether there is a case here or not.
maybe I'll just figure it out for myself.
FROST: this is great.
what? - Our suspects.
never seen so many rich, white faces.
it's "clue"
Jocelyn fairfield in the parlor with a knife.
their money goes back to Plymouth rock.
Oh, they made plenty of enemies in the last four centuries.
check this out.
the tabloids say Adam fairfield's marriage was on the rocks.
what about his brothers, Sumner and Garrett?
the victim was the oldest brother.
you know, doctor Isles dated the middle brother.
no kidding.
makes sense, I guess.
these people think they're royalty.
but look, even though Adam was the oldest, Sumner, the youngest, took over the family firm.
maybe Adam was a screw up.
not for long. He took over the business five years ago.
what about Garrett, the middle brother?
he owns a successful clothing company in Milan.
look at this
fraud allegations against Sumner.
that's why Adam took over.
Sumner fairfield now finds fulfillment with hands-on work at a food pantry.
no one comfortable in a mansion the size of my neighborhood chooses to do hands-on work of any kind.
let's go talk to him.
when did you last talk to harbor patrol?
two minutes ago. You were right here listening.
you tell them to find Adam's boat?
no, I left that part out.
I ran the company for six years while Adam partied and raced yachts.
so is he came back and took over because of fraud allegations?
you really don't know how the game is played, do you?
no, I never played the entitlement game.
I played the south Boston game, on asphalt with broken bottles, used needles. Educate me.
Adam got sick of clubbing, so I gave him a job.
next thing I know, the board's accusing me of fraud, and he is CEO.
why didn't the business go to him in the first place?
I mean, he was the oldest.
he and my dad fought a lot.
he waited until dad was dead before...
before what? Setting you up?
Yeah, he set me up. Guys, Tim! No, these go to the westerville pantry!
how bad did you want to even things up?
fairfields will do a lot of things to each other, detective, but brothers don't kill brothers.
Yeah. Where were you Saturday afternoon?
motorcycle ride. Beacon hill to new Redford. Beautiful day.
you guys want to see the gas receipts?
anyone go with you?
no. I ride alone.
come on -- Westerville pantry. Wrong palette!
you guys are way off.
it wasn't me. Adam was an experienced sailor.
so he didn't just fall off the boat.
well, what do you think?
I think I'd like to see a picture of Sumner on his bike.
cashmere.
well, those are from Garrett's line.
the sweaters start around, oh,$1, 000.
what's it made of, spun platinum?
the downy undercoat of cashmere goats.
this texture should be softer.
must be from the sea-salt exposure.
or maybe the goat was getting even.
that depression on the bone, what's that from?
Oh, it's hard to tell.
maybe the victim fell and hit his head on the edge of the boat.
Hey, doctor
you want to tell me why i'm really here on Jane's case?
Oh, well, I-I thought I could get the benefit of your sailing experience.
I got a little sunfish I throw in the back of the truck and take out to the cape.
well, you know, it -- it seems like the victim, you know, hit his head on the boat, maybe slipped, fell overboard.
W - what's your take?
my take is that you are the chief medical examiner, and this is not your first floater.
it -- it is my, uh, my 43rd.
Yes, my -- my 43rd.
I've been a cop a long time.
I know when people aren't telling me the whole story.
Jane's mad at me. - Oh, boy.
she thinks i'm being biased because I'm acquainted with the family.
acquainted? I heard it was a little more than that.
it was. - That's not it, though.
when you grew up like Jane, you're gonna have an attitude about people who, uh, who are entitled.
that's a form of prejudice.
where people like me and Jane come from, we didn't have a lot.
but we had each other's backs.
sounds to me like all Jane wants to know is, do you have hers or not?
so ma's got a new job. Selling that.
can you have the crime lab run a test on it?
I just want to make sure she's not gonna kill anybody.
Yeah, sure.
what's up?
ma is wearing lipstick every day.
she just bought some new clothes.
big new job hawking anti-aging potion. It makes sense.
what if there's more to it than that?
I mean, maybe she's thinking about leaving dad.
Colburn: detective Rizzoli.
all right, I'll see ya.
Mr. Colburn...
we subpoenaed aloof records from the estate.
I don't see you carrying any files.
there are sensitive international finances involved.
we can't have those documents floating around.
so the fairfields are above the law?
not at all. We're giving our complete cooperation.
Yeah, I can see that.
look, I'm not fooled by your $5, 000 suit.
I ran your background. I know where you come from.
St. Luke's parish. That's a tough neighborhood.
well, I've come a long way from there.
maybe too far when you're blindly protecting rich bosses.
my father collected trash.
I'd be doing the same if it wasn't for the fairfields.
their foundation put me through college and law school.
they gave me a job, they let me rise to where I am now
what, they "let" you?
I have assurances from the top authorities in the state that this matter will be handled swiftly and discreetly.
you got that?
I will handle this case the way I handie all my cases.
you seem like a bright young woman with a promising future.
I'd hate to see your career path cut short.
I had Boston detectives go through 27 hours of security footage on Sumner's bike route.
let me guess -- no sign of him or his motorcycle.
Nope. Nothing.
Jane's getting stonewalled by colburn.
can't get near the wife.
no idea if the wife even has an alibi or not.
can't talk to Garrett, either.
he flew in from Los Angeles by private jet Sunday morning.
after the murder.
preliminary autopsy report.
why give that to us instead of Jane?
don't go there.
there's evidence of blunt-force trauma, which could have happened when he fell off the boat.
pulmonary edema from drowning.
his stomach contents were "unusually well-preserved."
it's odd because I was able to determine that he had belong oysters at his last meal.
belon oysters? They're supposed to be amazing.
what are you, a friggin' foodie now?
well, they are prized for their unique tannic seawater flavor.
I read about them in the weekly.
only a couple restaurants in town serve them.
maybe we can figure out where he ate lunch.
any restaurant near a harbor?
Hey, I like oysters. They fry them, right?
what? No, no, no.
they serve them raw on the half shell.
come with us. - I will. Thank you.
belon oysters served raw with a touch of natural sea salt, and the chef recommends you not chew them.
food you can't chew. And you pay for that?
have you seen this guy in here recently?
I can't say that I have. - Lot of that going around.
damn, that's good.
dry, metallic,delicious.
you can't look at a dead body, but you could slurp that snot down?
that's what it is, you know -- oyster snot.
receipt from a corporate card -- Sullivan control systems.
it's a fairfield subsidiary.
John Hancock. That's hardly creative.
Hey, pal, can you pull the order off this receipt?
sure you're not gonna eat that? More for me.
dressing on the side.
it's chick food.
well...
no, no, no. Y - you're accurate.
I do prefer my dressing on the side.
may be a guy watching his cholesterol.
over fine wine at a romantic, seaside restaurant?
maybe he loves his wife.
uh, Jocelyn said she didn't see him that day.
so who did?
it's got 24-karat gold flakes in it.
are you making fun of me?
No! I thought it would be fun to try.
will you run some tests on this please?
what case? - Is Jane's mother poisoning the neighborhood?
sure.
so, you gonna try the chocolate?
what are you so dressed up for?
no reason. - Is this an apology?
for what? - Oh, boy.
you ask her.
Jane thought maybe Garrett would tell you the name of the woman his brother had lunch with before he died.
so this is a bribe.
tell Jane that if she thinks that chocolate will induce me to use my personal relationship with Garrett fairfield, she doesn't know me very well.
tell Maure that I didn't realize I need to bribe her with the hope diamond...
my phone. - ...to ge
I got to take this.
you looked really at home in that world.
it's where I'm from.
it's not where I chose to stay.
well, what are you doing down here slumming with us?
the same as you! I'm catching bad guys.
indeed the job. You don't.
look, I want my life to have meaning and purpose, the same as you.
sounds good, Maura.
I - I don't know what to believe anymore.
I'm not even sure whose side you're on.
your form still looks good.
so does yours.
you still running marathons?
once a year. I don't really have time for more. Work's pretty busy.
is that why you're here?
please tell me you didn't learn how to lie.
that was one of your most endearing traits.
the investigators think that your brother had lunch with a woman before he died.
they were hoping you might know who.
there's a reason I based my clothing company out of Milan.
I think I know why.
we used to talk a lot, remember?
it mightn't just been talk if it wasn't for you.
you inspired me to take a risk, go out on my own, get away from the clutches of my family.
and you did it. You got out.
Sumner and Adam, they fought a lot.
so what are you saying, that
that Sumner had something to do with Adam's death?
no.
fairfields will do a lot of things to each other, but...
brothers don't kill brothers.
you're not married, are you?
no.
I have to come back to Boston and run the business.
I can't leave it to Sumner. He's a mess.
do you know who Adam was seeing?
would you tell me if I promise to be discreet?
there hasn't been anyone serious for a long time.
how long?
college.
Rizzoli. - Jane.
Maura, I'm sorry.
it's okay. Listen, I don't have a lot of time.
Adam had a mistress. Vanessa Waldemar.
why -- why are you doing this?
because I have your back.
I gotta go.
Thanks.
miss me? - Yeah.
Rizzoli just called. Nicoise-salad eater has a name.
Vanessa Dewald. Adam fairfield's mistress?
Rizzoli tracked her down, talked to her.
her alibi checks out, but she had this interesting tidbit
Adam was divorcing his wife.
rich guys have prenups.
Jocelyn stood to lose hundreds of millions of dollars if Adam divorced her.
that's hundreds of millions of motives.
great. On our way.
harbor patrol found the boat.
I'll call Jane.
excuse me, gentlemen.
officer: boat was found in our waters.
it's a federal investigation now.
it's -- it's a nice ventriloquism act.
Yeah, I can barely see your lips moving.
our tow boat's on the way to take this craft to our slip.
that "craft" is our crime scene.
it's our jurisdiction. Move.
you want kids?
I would move.
you win. Blood on the boom.
hit his head, he got disoriented, fell overboard.
it's an accident.
I got his wallet and some sort of inhaler.
he had asthma.
Furling rig, twin helms, graceful shear, teak-capped railed, french
she's a beaut.
man, you need to get some.
this from a man who makes love to an oyster?
Jane, I did a once-around the hull -- No scrapes, no fender marks.
nothing docked with her at sea.
man, I'm cool, all right? I can admit when I'm wrong.
call it an accident.
I wish I could.
but it wasn't an accident.
Adam fairfield was murdered.
the mikrosil casting came back.
we got a partial impression of the object that struck Adam fairfield's skull.
it wasn't the boat's boom?
there's nothing on that boat that matches the impressions left on Adam's skull.
so somebody planted the blood on the boom.
that's the only explanation I can come up with.
so, the killer hides on Adam's boat, he waits until Adam is out to sea, hits him over the head with a weapon and then throws the weapon and the body overboard.
Yeah, but how does he or she get back to shore?
maybe a boat or a dinghy.
Korsak said there was nothing docked against the boat.
then there's an accomplice on another boat nearby.
it's a pretty perfect murder.
except that the imprints of the skull would match the weapon.
which is 20, 000 leagues under the sea.
Oh, ac-- that's actually a reference to unit of distance.
leagues across the ocean, not depth.
it's at the bottom of the ocean. Do you have a plan of finding it?
not a good one.
what?
there's just something about these fibers on Adam's cashmere sweater.
I'm gonna have the lab take another look at it.
you want to get a drink?
will it have gold flecks in it?
no.
the Cabernet here is chalky.
have a beer. It's cold.
I don't drink beer.
right.
well, we know for a fact that it's a murder, and we have two solid suspects with motive
the wife,cause she didn't want a divorce, and Sumner, because he's pissed at Adam for pushing him out.
and Colburn, who won't let you near them.
please don't talk to me about that guy.
you want to tell me what happened with Garrett?
there's not much to tell.
I loved that guy.
you know when you're so in love, you feel like you took some kind of a substance?
Oh, That's just narcissism.
maybe.
by the way, i,uh, I ran some tests on your mother's miracle juice.
it's 98% water.
the rest is sodium citrate, monopotassium phosphate.
anything harmful? - no.
but there's nothing helpful, either.
I should tell Frankie.
Oh, i,uh, I brought you a -- A present.
apology or bribe?
the fairfield family invite you and a guest to a memorial.
uh, Maura, this is tonight. - Yeah, I wasn't gonna go.
but you wanted access to my deluxe friends, Sumner and Jocelyn.
I want you to be my guest.
won't I embarrass you?
probably. But haven't I embarrassed you?
no... More than half a dozen times.
cocktail dress required.
can't I just go like this?
if you're going to embarrass me, at least do it in the proper clothes.
come on. I have most of my money tied up in charitable endowments, but not all.
I feel like i'm at my junior prom.
what?
okay, I think i'm getting a wedgie. Cover me.
Oh, god.
can't you do this in the bathroom?
no, it'll just take a second.
thank you. - Thank you.
- Thanks.
that is good.
lefevre Brut.
can't get that at 7-eleven, can you? Man. How much?
how much? I don't know.
guess. - no.
100 bucks?
maybe. I-I don't know.
100 bucks a bottle? Wow.
a glass.
Really? God, no wonder it's so good.
my mother would be trying to smuggle it home in her purse.
can you hold this? Thank you.
Oh, the results came back for the fibers on Adam's sweater.
do you mind if I just send this to frost to check it out?
no. Go ahead.
you look beautiful.
thank you.
you remember my friend, Jane Rizzoli.
of course. - Hello.
you're both absolutely breathtaking.
thank you. - Thank you.
usually, this would be a celebration, a big gala to raise money for Boston charities.
tonight, it's for Adam.
I guess it falls on me to commission a painting of him.
and the trophy we won when we were 8 and 10.
we used to trade it back and forth.
I brought it home for him.
it's a lovely gesture.
excuse me.
of course.
give me that. Give it to me.
I am hungry.
branzino with a meunire reduction.
Ugh, it -- It's looking at me like I personally put the hook in.
how am I supposed to eat that?
use your fish knife.
it's next to the melon spoon.
second from the right.
hold it like a pencil.
okay? Use the tip to cut the backbone.
then you cut the tail, and you place it on the side of the plate.
use this edge of the knife to remove the skin, and place it at the head of the plate.
there we go. Okay?
okay, uh, thes is how we do it in my family.
it's okay. Just eat it. It's delicious.
why do they serve beef wellington after fish?
and why does everything have to be so juicy?
that's interesting.
that explains why their alibis don't check out.
because they were probably with each other.
killing Adam fairfield.
detective. A moment.
right after I talk to your two pals about killing Adam fairfield.
please.
now, you've wondered what I've been covering up? Well, now you know.
they're having an affair.
no kidding.
but I know for a fact that they didn't kill Adam fairfield.
Oh, what do you got? We love facts.
while Adam was sailing, they were in a suite at the Ritz.
all afternoon.
so we just went from two suspects to none.
actually... I think we may have a new one.
I looked into that fiber for you.
good cashmere is 14 microns thick. This is 24.
subpar materials. W - why would Garrett be using cheap cashmere?
because he is broke. I called his suppliers.
he's behind on everything
uh, materials, warehousing, manufacturing, packaging.
the guy hasn't paid a bill in months.
okay, that makes no sense. He inherited a fortune.
looks like he burned through it all and then some.
okay, just because his company's in trouble doesn't mean that he's a killer.
I don't know.
maybe killing off your brother and inheriting the family empire, paying off your debt, turns you into one.
but he flew in after the murder.
flew in from Milan.
frost, uh, we can't get into that private jet manifest, can we?
no, we can only track the plane.
looks like it stopped in Los Angeles to refuel.
got stuck there for three days. Engine trouble.
and he and the plane arrived in Boston after the murder.
can we prove he was on that plane?
takes, what, three days to drive from Los Angeles to Boston?
you think he did it in the spyker?
Maura, I'm sorry.
you okay?
I should've seen it.
you did.
there is a reason that you didn't commit to him after college.
there is a reason that you're holding back now.
it's called gut instinct.
but there were clues, and I -- I couldn't put them together.
you did.
you did it subconsciously.
the oysters. That's how I missed it.
the oysters, and it was right in front of me the whole time.
okay, come on. I - I'll take it from here, okay?
look, I-I thought that Adam had asthma.
but he was taking a drug to treat panlobular emphysema, which is why he couldn't digest food.
he wasn't a smoker.
that is great for him.
the damage was caused by a disorder called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
s- sweetie, I- I'm sorry.
I - I don't know why you're telling me this.
it's inherited.
the illness that Adam had, all of the fairfield children should have, but they don't.
because Adam had a different father.
and that's who carried the fatal gene.
Adam was a half-brother.
so that's why he didn't inherit the family business.
because he wasn't part of the bloodline. He wasn't a Brahmin.
wait -- why didn't the father give it to Garrett?
he was next in line.
because they had a terrible relationship.
Garrett always used to say that he wanted to make his own way in the world.
and I'm not sure he had a choice.
and then that didn't work because he was going bankrupt.
Garrett said that brothers don't kill brothers.
I think he justified what he did because inhismind, Adam wasn't his brother.
it's motive, but it's not proof.
maybe Garrett didn't do it. - Jane, he did it.
and I think I know where the proof is.
it's how he got from Los AngelesTo Boston.
there's only one person I know who could've committed a murder one mile out at sea and still gotten back without a boat.
a triathlete.
Maura. - You know, you said brothers don't kill brothers.
but you knew that Adam had a different father, so in your mind, that meant that he wasn't really your brother.
Maura, come on. You know me.
the murder weapon left a unique impression in Adam's skull.
like this one.
it's the same pattern, isn't it, Maura?
we found it in your trunk.
run tests, Maura. You won't find anything on that.
cause this one is new.
the one that you used to kill your half-brother is at the bottom of the ocean.
have security escort the two ladies out. - Step out of the pool.
I think you should step out of the pool, Mr. Fairfield.
Colburn, what are you doing? You work forme.
I work for the fairfields.
okay.
here we go.
Yeah, I-i'm not really in a champagne kind of a mood.
good. It's beer.
I thought we would celebrate the simple things in life.
I don't really drink beer.
that's cause you've never had my beer.
okay, well, can we at least drink it your way?
Yes, we can. Let's -- Let's get this right.
remember when you asked me why I was slumming?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
well, now you know.
okay.
Cheers. - Cheers.
okay.
that's delicious. - Right? Wait till you try a spuckie.
I don't know what that is, but it sounds really
we need more water!
hill, Flynn, Grant! - Yes, sir?
we got to get this under control.
we got old, combustible buildings in a tight space.
grant, you're with Hill.
where do you want us, chief?
I need you guys to spread out inside.
knock it down as much as you can, okay? Now, go!
all right, listen, I'll take the rear.
I got the roof. - I'll take the front.
let's all go home.
let's go! Let's go!
come on, Jo. Pee.
Hey, potty.
you know what? Fine.
stay out here by yourself. Fine.
Oh, I'd hate to report you for doggie abandonment.
what are you doing here?
I was, um... In the neighborhood?
thank you.
it's good to see you.
more than good to see you.
no, don't be nice to her. Don't -- Jo, you're not getting out of this.
what are you doing here? You on leave? - No.
I, uh... I asked to be reassigned -- D. C.
Ah, so no more foreign wars.
for now.
is that... Bad?
no. It's just -- it's just unexpected.
well, you probably have to get to work.
so... - What, you're going?
Yeah. But I'm hoping to see you soon.
what's the card say?
read it.
call me.
hello.
good morning. - Damn it.
that's an awful lot of trouble for a cup of coffee.
well, my mother is an espresso enthusiast.
Yeah, it's the burden of being a super taster.
my mother is also a super smeller.
I used patchouli oil once in college, and you said you could smell it on me - when I came home for Christmas. - Oh, dreadful stuff.
how did you sleep?
surprisingly well.
her father snores.
I don't miss that part of marriage.
excuse me. Thank you.
Dr. Isles.
all right. Okay.
I'm sorry. I have to go to work.
a factory caught on fire early this morning.
we'll be fine.
I make a mean eggs Benedict.
Dean asked me to dinner.
so go!
what about Casey?
I wonder if they know each other.
well, they were both in Afghanistan.
Yeah, Maura, all 30, 000 of them know each other.
well, Dean only went to Afghanistan because you said you wouldn't read the Sunday paper in bed with him.
I was not ready for that big of a commitment.
you're not even ready for the commitment of calling him by his first name.
"Gabriel." It's just -- it's so weird.
it's so... Biblical.
firemen's formation. I hate it when they lose one of their own.
sad.
order! Arms!
I'll check out the body. - Okay.
arson squad's working it, but they're saying it looked accidental.
faulty space heater started a fire.
what do they make in here? - Denim jeans.
Denim" jeans?
as opposed to... Green polyester jeans?
see that guy?
old guy in the skinny jeans and the shades?
he's not that old.
I busted him at least three times in the '80s.
felony fashion crime?
would you two like a moment alone so you can fight?
he borrows my unmarked, and he brings it back empty!
Hey, it had gas!
busted Whistler for cocaine. Now he owns a jeans factory.
does he have any reason to burn it down?
maybe. Check it out, Frost.
sure. When you fill my tank back up.
with super.
his face shield is pitted.
he wouldn't have needed to take more than a few breaths before the smoke inhalation killed him.
it's a damn shame.
I'm so sorry, chief.
I sent him in there without any backup.
it's not your fault, Joe.
we've been fighting these blazes without enough people.
that's what budget cuts will get you.
this city's killing good men.
forced layoffs, station closing.
well, we can't do anything about budget cuts, but let's make sure there was nothing else at work here.
I never understood guys who wanted to run into burning buildings.
you chase murderers.
not if they're on fire.
do you know why firefighters call their outfits "bunker gear"?
their "outfits"?
Yes, because they keep their outfits next to their bunks.
darn!
Hey, did you know the first helmet was developed by luggage maker Henry Gratacap?
does your brain ever get tired?
no. Why?
well, just with all the useless information -- no?
God, how hot does a fire have to be to melt the face shield?
this can withstand heat up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.
and he's got scorched gloves.
if his gloves are scorched and his face shield is melted, shouldn't the rest of his body be badly burned, as well?
not necessarily.
the fire suit can withstand heat up to 1, 300 degrees.
pulmonary parenchymal damage consistent with inhaling air above 265 degrees.
odd.
what... Odd?
he takes a breath or two, and boom -- he's dead by smoke inhalation.
the soot build-up on the walls and windows -- that's evidence of a low-oxygen fire.
but his face shield and lungs say it's a high-oxygen fire.
I wrote about this once in the journal of Combustible Science.
Yes. It was a fabulous article. I loved the photos.
I'll print it up for you.
Maura... Why waste paper?
I'll --I'll read it online.
you're not gonna read it.
no, probably not.
but you are going to dinner with Gabriel.
how'd you know I was going to dinner?
you brushed your teeth.
I-I always... Brush my teeth... At work... Sometimes.
I have a reservation at the Ivory Table.
I could call and make it four. We could double-date.
Really? Why? Who's your date?
my mother.
Oh, so, you, me, Gabriel, and your mother.
how can I say "no"?
you're being sarcastic, aren't you?
very. If it was anyone but you, I'd say that's the creepiest idea ever.
the arson squad released the space heater to my team.
hmm, did you just say the "a" word?
no. Yes. - So you think it was arson?
no. Yes.
no. Anything?
I think it's this heater that was recalled in 1997, but it's covered in debris, so I'm not sure.
fire can be a very clever opponent.
Yeah.
take it apart. Look for any anomalies.
I've requested all Boston fire department records for the last year.
that's like 4, 000 fires.
4, 082 building and structural fires.
well, if you're looking at the incident reports for a possible pattern, then you are thinking the "a" word and I need to let the arson squad know.
I think Gabriel is a really good match for you.
nobody ask you, Yenta.
whistler, our old guy in the skinny jeans, is a pervert.
okay, what would you like me to do with this information?
check this out -- five different lawsuits.
women suing him right and left for sexual harassment.
two seamstresses, an accountant, a model, and... Really? A cleaning woman.
strong libido. Apparently it doesn't take him much to get interested.
apparently.
pretty expensive to fend off five lawsuits.
Yes, it is.
maybe Arnold burnt down his only asset to collect the insurance money.
let's go talk to him.
do you have an eye condition?
excuse me? - The sunglasses.
it's safe to remove them. Our lights are harmless.
I've advised Mr. Whistler that this interview is 100% voluntary.
he's not required... - it's all right, hon.
I've got nothing to hide from these people.
did you just call your lawyer "hon"?
christie is my daughter.
she's Harvard law, right, hon?
I handle all matters pertaining to Arnold Whistler.
then you're handling all the sexual harassment claims against your father?
nuisance lawsuits.
it's a bunch of angry single women.
those are a lot of angry "hons," Mr. Whistler.
those fat bitches are suing me for being nice?
tell them I'm gonna sue them for leaving their space heaters on.
I'm the victim.
my business is destroyed. What about me?
what about the firefighter who died trying to save your factory?
well, those are the breaks. It's his job
Hey, dad... - hon, don't interrupt me.
listen to me, Mr. Whistler.
we're going to dig into your life, and if we find out that you had anything to do with setting that fire, you're gonna wish you were on the inside sewing jeans when it went up.
I don't appreciate your tone, detective.
me, neither. Come on, hon.
your father never lets me eat garlic -- never!
I'm so glad you liked it.
it's delightful just being able to see you.
I wish we'd done this more.
come to see me? - Me too.
no. It's... I...I wish... - You wish what?
I wish that I had stopped being busy and... Just enjoyed you.
stop, mom, it's okay.
no. It's not.
it's really true that your life gets lived while you are doing other things.
come on. Come on, let's go home.
let's have some tea.
you know me. Tea's not gonna do it.
mom!
somebody, call an ambulance!
call 911!
you look amazing.
you look like you're about to eat here.
hope that's okay. No?
no, it's okay. I just... I feel silly.
I'm a little overdressed for take-out.
don't. I want to look at you.
and I want you all to myself.
you know what? You can take me out.
I'm not gonna run away with the busboy.
what smells good? What'd you bring? - Hey.
let's do this right. Do you have some plates?
gosh, I usually just throw the food on the counter.
okay, just... One sec.
Hey, Maura. What's up?
I'm so sorry.
are you okay?
contusions and scrapes. I'm fine.
Where's your mom?
she's still in surgery.
it's bad, Jane.
they wouldn't let me in the ambulance with her.
he just drove into her, and then he left her.
Oh, God.
um, uh, what can I do?
turn the clock back.
did you see the car?
no. It all happened so fast.
I sound like all those people that we see every day, don't I?
it's okay.
she pushed me out of the way, Jane.
my mother saved my life.
Oh. How is she?
it was a severe open pelvic fracture, just like you thought.
okay. Uh, and how's the bleeding?
we performed an anterior pelvic open reduction and internal fixation.
and the head and the cervical CTS?
there's some cranial bleeding, but we're doing all that we can, Dr. Isles.
I know you are. Thank you, doctor.
you're welcome. Just hold on.
Oh, my God. What if she dies?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
my father's in Tanzania.
even if I could reach him, it would take him two days to get here.
Maura, she's not gonna die.
she's not.
this is Frost.
he's already working on the hit-and-run re-enactment.
go. - No, no, no.
Yes. Yes. Please.
go and do what you do better than anyone I know.
find the bastard who did this.
please.
go.
who are you dressed for?
a person. Shut up.
well, nice to see you, too.
I think you look great.
thank you.
now, show me what you're gonna show me, or I'm getting out.
the hit-and-run driver came from that direction.
minimum speed the vehicle was traveling at the time of impact, 40 miles per hour.
okay, you're just doing this to show off your car.
I could have read that in the report.
can you talk to detective Rizzoli? Because I can't.
I asked Frankie to do a hit-and-run work-up for the fatal-accident team to help him get into homicide faster.
so you want to see what I found out, or you want to pick your toes?
I'm not picking my toes. My feet hurt.
so don't wear dumb shoes.
show me!
all right, yeah, so, there are no skid marks prior to point of impact.
so that means the driver never applied the brakes.
well, maybe he didn't see them.
Frankie's got a different theory.
see those?
locked wheel skid marks.
those say that the driver stopped after he hit Constance.
so he didn't just take off.
but not because he had a conscience.
take a look at the back-up cam.
he hit reverse.
that's where Maura fell. Right between those parked cars.
spin burn marks.
this wasn't an accident. He was trying to hit her.
don't scream, Maura. Okay?
what the hell are you doing here?
I came as soon as I heard.
you came for what? - For her.
she's a good woman.
what do you know about my mother?
I'd like you to leave.
not until I know she's okay -- and you're okay.
you're here to knock heads? You think that's gonna help?
you'll see one day when you have a child -- Give it up. You're a murderer.
I'd rather not be reminded that you fathered me. Go!
Maura... - I'm gonna scream on the count of three.
one... - look...
I'll tell you who your mother is.
that's my mother.
you once asked me...
don't like to be toyed with. Two.
I will tell you one day.
when you're calm.
get out.
did he say why he came?
not really.
but he seemed like he knew her.
he knew Constance?
he said he'd tell me who my biological mother is.
do you want to know that?
well, he can't just keep popping in and out of your life like this, okay, Maura?
we'll get him.
I don't know if I want you to.
well, it's not up to me.
but you've got a more serious problem right now, okay?
somebody tried to kill you.
skid marks can mean a lot of things.
someone tried to run you over. All right?
we've got to figure out who that is before they try it again.
Jane, I have testified in hundreds of murder trials.
any one of those men and women convicted could want me dead.
I put a uniform outside. Do you want me to stay?
no. No, just keep digging.
I'll be okay.
you know, I'll never tell you that it'll be okay when I don't know that it will.
but I am here for you. Okay?
so nice of you to bring these for Jane.
and I always wanted to try these.
you'd look great in those -- dark-wash skinnies, our top seller.
what size are you? A four?
I haven't been a size four since
since never. Step away from the jeans, ma.
I was too a size four. How would you know?
what's the matter with you?
the person that you're flirting with happens to be a suspect in a possible arson murder.
what do you think -- that bribing my mother is gonna clear your name?
listen, hon, you're tying up my money with that insurance company.
you bet I am. Take your jeans and go.
Really?
crime lab found microscopic traces of black isocyanate paint embedded in the broken watch crystal.
it's automotive paint, Jane.
Oh, really? What makes you think that?
because she was hit by a car?
okay, how do I get you to talk to me like you talk to Frost?
well, don't state the obvious, first of all, all right?
did you run it through the automotive paint database?
Yeah. Went back 30 years. Didn't find a match.
so we're thinking custom paint job, maybe.
okay, see? That's... Better.
I mean, it's still kind of obvious, but it's better.
could be an older car. What's the next step, Frost?
he's about to impress you.
we sent it to the Toronto forensic lab.
okay. I'm impressed.
Oh, it's the largest automotive paint database in the world.
back to obvious. Unimpressed.
Dr. Isles' mom gonna make it?
I hope so.
crime lab tech came by to bring you some photos.
Yeah, she was supposed to take apart the space heater.
they found all the components but the thermal cut-off switch.
what, you think somebody tampered with it?
crime lab can't say till they have Dr. Isles look at it.
you really think we're looking at an arson?
maybe.
but I don't think that Arnold Whistler stopped harassing women long enough to take a space heater apart.
maybe we should check out those fire records that Maura was asking for, see if there's a pattern.
will you check with arson and see what is taking them so long?
Yeah, sure. - Thanks.
okay, what I'm about to say doesn't leave this room.
paddy Doyle's back in town.
Oh, man. - For payback.
his daughter was a target in a hit-and-run.
and... I didn't put a BOLO out on him.
makes sense -- let him watch her back until we find out who's after her.
she's the one person we know he'll keep safe.
hell, Jane, for all we know, this all could be connected to Doyle.
a rival trying to draw him out.
I'll reach out to a southie C. I.see what he knows.
okay.
I mean, we got to put Doyle away at some point.
how's Maura gonna be with that?
after all this, I hope relieved.
did you have a nice day?
Oh, yeah. It was great. You?
is Maura okay?
no.
are you okay?
sort of.
I came back for one reason.
why, you need someone to drink a six-pack with you?
Yeah. You.
um... Things might have gotten a little... Complicated.
there may be someone else.
I don't care.
I'll take my chances.
I came back for you.
there was something on my cheek.
was it your hand?
you got to lay off the boxing, lady.
it's all right. I should have asked.
you don't have to ask.
Oh, crap.
what? - I got to go check on Maura.
anything I can do?
Yeah, um, you can go away.
you're very distracting.
no, you know what?
um, actually... Actually, there is something you can do for me.
I don't really want to go away.
no, come on. No, it's not that.
can you just be Gabriel?
please.
Oh, my God. You just said my name. That's so weird.
come on.
just... Not be agent Dean.
can you do that for me, please?
Yeah.
paddy Doyle is back in town.
you think the hit-and-run is connected to him?
I mean, if one of his enemies wanted to get back at him, Maura's the perfect target.
and things could get a little ugly, huh?
that's why you're telling me.
Yeah. How will I protect her?
paddy Doyle is one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives.
Oh, God. Okay.
well, I guess we'll always have south Boston.
so that's it?
I... I pursue an organized crime boss, and you and I are
I don't know. I don't know, Dean.
but this always happens.
I gave you my word I'd just be me.
I won't do anything until you tell me I can.
I'm not leaving until you finish those pancakes. I added quinoa.
Dr. Oz says they're very good for you.
thank you.
you're here.
her vitals stabilized.
she's still critical, but she's a little better.
I really had to get back to work.
good.
Hey, ma, can I have some pancakes?
Yeah. I-I tried a new recipe.
how are they?
gritty.
Yuck.
"yuck"? What do I do with "yuck"?
do you have any macaroni and cheese?
for breakfast? - Yeah.
Dr. Oz would not approve.
mac and cheese has a very high fat content, empty calories due to white flour.
do you have to ruin everything?
sorry.
my mother would never let me eat anything like that.
well, you were deprived.
I used to think that kids who had bologna on white bread were lucky.
turns out I was the lucky one.
I used to think that kids who had really big allowances and never had to go to church were lucky.
turns out they were.
that would probably be a lot better with some grated pecorino Romano.
Yeah. - I got ketchup.
Thanks, ma.
Hey, Jane. I got 'em.
you okay? - Yeah.
thank you.
toronto lab found something.
the transfer paint on your mom's watch matched "black diamond"?
that's an old paint used on '70s police cruisers.
that's encouraging.
I mean, how many 40-year-old cars are still on the road?
can you take this upstairs to Frost?
tell him to put out a BOLO.
we're looking for a 1970s old Chevy impala.
copy that.
Thanks.
okay. So, I have to tell you something.
I told agent Dean that Paddy is back in town.
well, you have to do what you have to do.
okay, but he's not gonna do anything until I tell him to, because... I told Gabriel instead of agent Dean.
thank you.
arson squad sent over the fire incident reports.
this isn't even all of them, Jane.
all right. We'll divide them up.
about 400 have already been investigated by the arson squad.
the rest were ruled accidental.
great. That only leaves us 3, 700.
they found the car! - How do you know?
same model, same paint.
excellent. Come on, let's go.
kind of reminds me of the Blues Brothers car.
w-who are the Blues Brothers?
you did not just say that.
no prints. It's wiped clean.
do you recognize it?
no. All I saw was the headlights and the tail lights.
all right. Well, this is definitely hair.
and this is blood.
Maura, it's okay. We got this. All right?
I wanted to see it, I know it's just an inanimate object. I just
it's okay to be upset. - No, come on.
I can't cry at work. It's unprofessional.
I'm just gonna go to the hospital.
I'm gonna have a uniform follow you home.
Jane? - Yeah.
transmission fluid.
nobody's driven this for a while.
Yeah, there's a trail of it.
car must have broke down.
that's why he left it here.
no plates or tags, no VIN number.
vehicles made before 1981 just had an I. D. Tag.
how we gonna trace it? - We can't without the tag.
what is this? It's like a decal or an emblem was here.
can you put some fingerprint powder right there?
good idea.
might stick to the adhesive there. - Yeah.
what was here?
uh, can you take some pictures of this?
a lot of 'em. - Got something.
what is that? - A washer for something.
there's a stain on the floor mat on this side.
doesn't look like blood.
Hey, could you collect the floor mat and swab it before you take it to the lab?
I think our bad guy was in a hurry.
she's doing much better.
it was nice meeting you, Mr. Isles.
you told her you're my father?
I said I'm your uncle.
I wanted to keep an eye on your mom while you checked out the perp's car.
how did you know that?
I don't miss anything if it relates to you.
I never knew you were there.
I wanted to be the kind of man who could be this little girl's dad.
so why weren't you?
I couldn't be anything but what I was -- a low-class thug from south Boston.
my dad, my uncles, hell, my grandfather -- all Irish mob.
and I grew up wanting to be just like them.
until I met your mom.
I mean your birth mom.
she was so different, so... Special.
I wanted to be good enough for her.
why did she give me up?
she was only 18.
she was brilliant, like you.
what the hell did she see in you?
you know how many times I've asked myself that?
mom?
mom?
what's happened?
mom, you've been in an accident.
somebody was here... Talking to me... Telling me...
I must live for my daughter.
was it Patrick?
Hey. What are you doing here?
I'm distracting myself because if I don't fill my brain with "useless" information,
I start crying, okay?
okay.
uh, any idea what this is?
Where'd you find it?
I thought maybe one of my techs misplaced it when they took the heater apart.
how's that possible? We just found it.
no, this is the thermal cutoff switch from this space heater.
for this space heat?
Yes. Where did you find it?
in the car that hit your mother.
what?
a-are you sure? - Yeah.
so whoever tried to kill you in that car started the fire.
but why would I be a target? - Think about the timeline, okay?
the arson squad says it's an accident.
you ask to check the space heater.
and then, next thing you know, a hit-and-run driver is taking a shot at you.
I have results on the stain in the suspect's car.
Thanks.
dextromethorphan, guaifenesin, glycerol.
commonly referred to, for those of us with a PhD in organic chemistry, as...?
cough syrup.
great.
low-oxygen fires don't burn at a temperature necessary to do this to his gloves.
I can't explain the damage to his airway, either.
sorry, Dr. Isles, but you said you wanted the gas chromatography results when they were in.
thank you.
this is the analysis of the substances I found on Craig Hill's face shield.
there's something here.
gas chromatography is used to separate and analyze compounds that can be vaporized.
could you say that in earthling?
there are trace levels of potassium permanganate on his face shield.
even more earthling.
you see this?
cough syrup. We found traces of that in the hit-and-run driver's car.
glycerol is the chief ingredient in cough syrup.
this is potassium permanganate.
watch this.
stand back.
when glycerol is used as an accelerant, potassium permanganate becomes extremely combustible.
no kidding.
the outside edge of Craig Hill's face shield was coated in it.
and then glycerol was added.
the cough syrup.
so somebody must have thrown it in his face.
that's why his face shield melted.
but what about his gloves? Why'd they catch fire?
well, it's possible the gloves ignited because they were coated, too.
so he never had a chance. Somebody wanted him dead.
somebody who was in the fire with him.
maybe it was personal.
maybe.
bunch of white guys sued the Boston fire department in 2001.
claimed that their affirmative action hiring plan was discriminatory.
Craig Hill was African American.
not bad for the old white guy.
now, that's harassment, Frost.
what, the "old" part or the "white" part?
find out if any of the firefighters from engine company 15 were part of that lawsuit before Korsak sues you, Frost.
here's the original complaint. Yeah, Jim Grant.
he was named.
we talked to him. He fought the Whistler fire with Craig Hill.
how many times I got to tell you? Check my damn alibi.
we are. And it's a good one, Jim.
consoling dead firefighter's wife.
ask her.
you didn't like the fact that Craig Hill had a lower test score, but he was hired before you, did you?
no. Would you?
no.
wasn't Craig's fault.
department changed its policy.
my dad was a firefighter. My granddad.
and they're telling me "no" because of the color of my skin?
alibi checks out.
Craig Hill's widow said he was there at the time of the hit-and-run.
I thought we were talking about a fire.
you can go now.
Craig was a damn fine firefighter.
we all miss him.
we're sorry for your loss, man.
this is what was on the back of the hit-and-run car.
one of these.
that's a St. Florian cross.
Boston firefighters union used to hand these out in the '70s.
well, none of them are old enough.
maybe it was a legacy.
Yeah, Jim Grant said his dad and grand dad were Boston firefighters.
one of them could have given him the cross.
no, Grant's got an airtight alibi.
it's got to be someone from engine company 15.
well, we could interrogate all of them.
no, you can't. There's not gonna be any more interrogations.
grant complained to his union, and every firefighter in the city is lawyered up.
and they're pissed at us.
well, that's not good. - No, it's not.
Oh, thanks.
this is the last of the arson squad's fire reports from last year.
they're all from engine company 15 -- where were they?
that's weird. Craig Hill had them checked out.
our victim?
Craig Hill is looking into every fire that his company responded to in the last year, and then he ends up dead?
what the hell was he about to find?
carbon build-up, electrical fire, water heater explosion
all of these were ruled as accidental.
happens all the time.
nothing I'm looking at looks suspicious, either.
okay, but here's what's weird.
all of these fires started at 6: 00 A. M. ... On a Tuesday in district 21.
does anybody know what's special about Tuesday in that district?
garbage day is all I can think of. - Yeah.
and the fires all began at commercial businesses in the early morning before garbage pick-up.
Yeah. And what's a great source of fuel for a fire?
garbage.
so Craig Hill must have figured out that somebody was deliberately setting fires in his district.
somebody that was good enough to make them look accidental.
so when I requested the files to review them, I became the next target.
so now what do we do?
well, our suspect is probably a firefighter.
we got to flush him out.
how? - I might have an idea.
thank you.
I'm sorry for this, but as the medical examiner,
I am entitled to collect forensic evidence from city property.
anything else? My men aren't too happy.
I can see that. And I'm sorry.
there is something else.
I'd like the plans for the Whistler factory.
more evidence collection?
Yes.
look, I can't guarantee the safety of that building.
it's quite all right. I know what I'm doing.
thank you.
you looking for where Craig died?
Yes.
it's Kevin Flynn.
we found him right about here.
and my grandfather died fighting the '72 Vendome fire.
I'm sorry.
city kept cutting back and cutting back.
how do you fight all these fires without enough firefighters, huh?
you followed me?
you shouldn't have come here by yourself.
why not? - You know why not.
I had to make sure people understand that they just can't keep laying us off.
how did you do that, Kevin?
you know how. I burned a few buildings.
and then Craig started digging around.
just like you.
you both should have just left it alone.
Kevin, don't! Don't!
drop your weapon, Doyle!
Gabriel, no!
No!
what the hell?
No!
hope... - Hope? What do you hope?
hope... Maura!
"Hope..." What do you hope?
Oh, God. Maura...
don't touch him! - Maura!
no, I mean it!
don't you dare touch him.
this hurts.
pain is only in the mind.
right leg up, and flip your dog.
it feels like my leg.
back to downward dog.
my mind has a cramp.
you know the guy that keeps smiling at you... Jorge?
he just broke up with his girlfriend.
Really?
Mm-hmm. Double date tomorrow night.
No!
sorry.
what does he do? Medicine.
Oh, all right.
okay.
mindful awareness is what can subdue the primitive consciousness and bring the physical body under control of the will.
I totally agree.
I have to go.
Yeah, you can't leave before savanna.
corpse pose.
Maura, let's go.
thank you.
Namaste.
come on!
you got her to do yoga.
no, it was my idea. I love yoga.
we had to leave before Ardha Chandrasana .
I feel very unbalanced.
she was dragged here.
Oh, that's all been photographed and inventoried.
gaynor Randle. 32.
ATM $100. Scratch robbery.
did you find what was used to beat her?
not yet.
vintage. She had a flair for clothes.
hm, she was sexually assaulted.
reddish-brown stains on the inner thighs and external genitalia.
I hear an echo.
she was married.
pager's totaled.
it's not a pager.
it's a glucose-management system - Insulin pump.
she was diabetic.
Yep. Needle sticks.
she probably had to check her glucose level about 5 to 10 times a day.
maybe this.
Yeah, she kept careful records.
her last glucose-level reading was over 400.
is that good or bad? It's extremely high.
is that good or bad?
bad. She wasn't getting any Insulin.
she probably had slurred speech, trouble walking.
that explains why there's no defensive wounds.
she couldn't fight back.
murder weapon has a rectangular edge on it.
I can't confirm that.
Hey, Frost, we're looking for a 2x4...
frost, we're looking for an idiot.
that your way of saying you want to talk to the husband?
what's it say about relationships that the husband or the boyfriend's our first suspect?
are you getting ready for an "I hate men" speech?
I like men, just... Not the ones that kill.
it may not be the husband.
because she didn't have a husband.
we're sorry for your loss, Mrs. Randle.
I prefer "Mel."
and it's Gaynor-Randle. We took each others names.
the commonwealth recognizes our marriage.
I have a right to know who did this.
of course you do. We want to know, too.
when was the last time you spoke to her?
5: 00 A.M, maybe?
did she always work late?
always... on my night out.
I'm the, uh, captain of the LGBT bowling league.
Lesbian-gay- bisexual-transgender.
uh, what time did you get home? About 10: 00P.M.
I called Katie's office, her cell.
by midnight, I was calling the E. R. and you guys over and over again.
you can check with my alarm company, my cell records...
...the bowling alley.
we will have to verify your whereabouts.
understood.
I suppose it's always the first suspect.
I'm sorry. That's okay.
Oh, come on. It's not like she has to worry about the scar.
don't rush me.
well, multitask, then. Time of death?
the core temperature I took hepatic ally was 31.3 degrees.
killed between 2: 00 and 3: 00 A. M.
jorge say anything about me?
yoga Jorge?
no, jaunty lube Jorge.
oil change? I don't go there.
total ripoff. Maura, come on. What's he say about me?
he said, "sure."
when Brock asked about having a double date.
no, I'm not going. Oh, Jane.
what about DNA substance from the sexual assault?
no semen, but I did collect some deerskin fibers.
so we're looking for Bambi.
no, deerskin from apparel.
W... Moccasins, a tepee?
no, tepees are generally constructed from buffalo hides.
W... Wow you are so literal.
but deerskin actually has great tactility.
small pores make it soft, tough...
work gloves.
so no prints.
Oh! What?
jorge thinks you're hot.
forget it.
come on, Jane. Listen to me.
every time he looks at you, he contracts his orbicular is oculi and pars orbitalis.
gross. It's facial muscles. Please.
only if you tell me what killed her.
there should be more blood associated with her facial lacerations.
I'm gonna have so much fun on my couch, alone.
and it looks like the assault and the rape happened post-mortem.
what, she was raped and beaten after she was killed?
so what killed her?
I don't know yet.
well, I don't know when I'm gonna have time for dinner.
an adrenaline response to panic over stressed her heart, which was already compromised by diabetes.
so, why rape and beat her once she was dead?
look at this.
means "girl" in welsh.
since when do lawyers have club stamps?
Yeah, she came in Monday nights like clockwork.
she was here last night.
did you see her leave?
it was packed.
did you see her, uh, with... with her wife?
no, but she talked about her.
I mean, it seemed like a - like a good relationship.
as far as marriages go.
Yeah. We have that in common.
rob was here last night. He worked the door.
last name?
thatcher. It's not him, though.
I checked him out before I hired him.
he's clean enough to squeak.
detective Rizzoli. This is detective Frost.
I heard about it on the radio.
Yeah, she slid up in here right before happy hour ended.
drinks go up after 7: 00.
did you see her with anybody?
we have a lot of good-looking ladies here.
did you see her leave? No. Sorry.
God, I hate this.
if she'd just gone someplace else, she'd still be alive.
Why? Cause it's a lesbian bar?
Yeah.
I didn't take these psychos seriously.
it's Massachusetts. Same-sex marriage is legal here.
can we take this?
Yeah, it's yours. Thanks a lot.
if you think of anything...
all right.
escalating threats.
desecration of Katie's body.
looks to me like we got ourselves a hate crime.
uh, "sons and daughters of Adam."
that's your catchphrase, isn't it?
I'm offended to see sacred words associated with pornography.
how about associated with murder?
I-I think it's interesting that they sent a female and an African-American to interview me about a homosexual murder.
you don't like women or African-Americans either?
well, I have a right to my opinion.
only if you don't enforce it with a 2x4.
we're gonna need to see a list of your members.
Oh, surely. I came prepared.
those are all members?
we're national.
Satan is using homosexuals to destroy the kingdom of God.
be on the lookout for a man in a red cape with a tail and pointy ears.
I will pray for you.
no, thank you. I'll do it myself.
and, so, this drunk, with a knife, is outrunning my old partner, Korsak.
he finally catches up to him.
he grabs him by the shorts - true story...
and...they rip right off.
please tell me he's wearing underwear.
no. No, he's not.
no. No.
so, that was my first week on the job.
I got to tackle a naked guy. Nice.
Yeah.
I think that sounds like fun.
anyone for some, uh, dessert, some coffee?
actually, it - it's getting kind of late.
you know, I think I need to use the ladies' room.
Oh. Jane?
will you join me?
no, no, no. I don't need to go.
I think you do.
I need to go to the ladies' room, if you'll excuse me.
please.
what are you... Oh!
Shh! Come on.
I thought you needed to go to the restroom!
that was a ruse. Well, do you like him?
he's sexy. Mm, yeah, I think you should take him home.
Maura. What? You said he was sexy.
well, just because I like the way he looks in yoga class doesn't mean I'm gonna like the way he looks in my bed.
right.
but did you know that sex releases immunological "a"?
it wards off colds.
no. Not tonight.
a-and I didn't shave my legs.
nice try.
what kind of person are you?
you're like a racecar...
finely tuned... beautiful...
fast...
I'm not that fast.
Hey! Wow, look at you.
Aw, I should take her for a walk.
Hm? Okay.
let's take her for a walk. Come here, little boo-boo.
come on. Okay.
uh, Maura said that you're in medicine.
are you a doctor?
no.
Uh...E. M.T?
nurse.
a male nurse. That is so cool.
you should get the biodegradable ones.
right.
uh, so, what happened between you and your girlfriend?
Oh, we didn't agree about kids.
Oh, she wanted them, you didn't?
no.
I just love the idea of being a stay-at-home daddy.
but she wanted to stay home, too.
someone's got to work, right?
Yeah. Wow. I'm surprised.
Why? Because I'm Hispanic? It's a new world.
see, I am looking for a really strong woman.
someone who knows how to hold warrior two, like you.
come on. Let's go. Come on.
coming? Yeah.
come on. Okay.
let's go for our walkie-kins. So much fun!
Really?
that bad?
I thought you said you couldn't lie.
what do you mean? I can't. You did.
only one time, when I said I'd finished my homework and I hadn't, and I immediately went vassalage.
fainted.
Jorge's in "medicine"?
technically, yes, he is.
what's his specialty? Lactation?
orthopedics.
Joe Grant was a detective, he was sexy, and he was a perfect match for you.
well, I kind of liked him.
Yeah, well, you butted heads with him until he moved to Washington.
so you hooked me up with nurse Jorge.
Wh... I... I just... Yes.
it's not funny.
Hey. Anything come up on those background checks?
still waiting on that, uh, bouncer from the club, and no red flags on anybody here.
somebody's got a boyfriend.
someone should mind his own business.
what... No.
your eyes are like pools of midnight!
No! Come on. What? What?
Your-r-r lips are like... Tempur-pedic pillows.
Really? Just give this.
dinner. Saturday. I'm already in the kitchen.
sounds kind of sissy to me.
Hey, guy cooks.
Yeah, I know.
it's a match.
excuse me? The bouncer.
"Robert Thatcher..." it's an alias.
real name is "Roy Tompkins."
so, that's why he lied. Look at this.
outstanding warrant... New York City for criminal sexual assault.
come on.
Hey, Roy. We need to talk to you.
Oh. I wouldn't do that, Roy.
been holding out on me, Bruce Lee!
we can do this all day, Roy. What happened to Katie?
look, I can't tell you what I don't know!
what is so important?
jorge dropped off lunch for you.
that's not why I interrupted you.
I extracted the killer's DNA from the murder weapon.
who is he?
well, there was no match in CODIS, but it's not a "he."
it's a "she."
the killer is a woman?
were off the killer's glove?
seams were breached, and DNA tests confirmed that the sweat was from a female.
Yeah, we already know that, and a male accomplice raped her.
no, injuries are consistent with a non-biological phallus-shaped object.
you mean a dildo?
Yes, I believe that is the popular term for it.
but did you know that a 28, 000-year-old stone phallus was recently found in a German cave?
ice-age men were using it for knapping flints.
Yeah, ice-age women were using it for making sparks, too.
Yeah, okay.
so, if she wasn't raped, it's probably not a hate crime.
it wasn't a robbery.
I'm beginning to think this was personal.
I wonder if Jorge read the chump study.
chump study. Probably wrote it.
chocolate happiness undergoing more pleasantness study.
Yeah, I-it actually concluded that chocolate makes us happier.
chocolate from Jorge makes me sadder.
Mmm. Flowers.
flowers have been shown to reduce depression.
come on, Jane. Jorge's a catch.
if you don't want them, can I have them?
Jorge? Yeah, he's all yours.
maybe if I get fat, he'll stop calling.
I just think if you allow him to see all sides of you, then he'll stop calling.
you know what?
I just heard what that sounded like, and that is...
what I meant to say was that...
human beings have good and bad traits, you know, and you have, you know...
some characteristics that are a little...
n-not as, um...
wow, fudge clusters.
Katie was deleting her...
search history on her computer.
Why? What was she hiding?
have we checked the wife's alibi?
solid.
tracked all her calls... E. R. 911.
alarm company confirms she activated her home alarm 03 P. M. didn't break the circuit again till 6: 17 A. M.
she didn't do it. How do you know?
got Mel's scorecard from the night of the murder.
she's a hell of a bowler. She had a turkey.
why would she do that?
that's three strikes in a row, Maura.
Oh. Wish I could get her for our team.
but you got to be divorced.
can you try to restore all that history that Kate deleted?
let's give it a shot.
really yummy.
sorted by popularity.
hmm, spent a lot of time on cupid4girls. com...
Lipstidate. com.
online hook-up services.
so, Katie was cheating on her wife.
somebody posted a message for her the day she was killed.
liked our time at the merch. Want to play again?
our victim was having more than a drink after work.
can you trace the I. P. Addresses?
smart. What?
they set up the website to hide all I. P. Addresses...
protects their customers.
Yeah, and hides the cheaters.
why work so hard to get the right to marry...
to do the same thing that straight couples do?
I don't know.
Hey, Korsak.
they kind of...
resemble each other.
Jane and the victim.
you're right. Be a shame to waste an opportunity like that.
no. We could...
no way.
we could try and bait a trap.
post the same kind of message Katie did, attract the same kind of woman.
arrange dates, get DNA, see if we get a match.
how? We stick a fork in them?
you buy her a drink, you take the glass.
club owner seemed like she had cooperate.
Jane could...Possibly... Wear a wire.
no.
no, I'm not gonna go undercover to troll for lesbian dates on the random chance that we catch a killer, no.
I think she loves the idea.
me too.
why do they do this?
the categories are such stereotypes.
"femme," "boy next door," "sporty," or "fine."
Jane's definitely "fine."
I'm just saying, for the purposes of the advertisement, you know, to draw the best response.
Yeah. Right.
okay, I-I j-just have to check a box, so, "femme," "butch, " "lipstick," "chapstick,"
sporty.
I've seen her break a chair over the head of a meth-crazed gangbanger.
So..."Butch"?
Yeah.
I mean, she took him out.
no. No, no, no, no.
she's... no, no. She's my friend.
I-I'm not putting "butch."
she's... I'm putting "sporty."
just check what the victim checked, huh?
Oh. Let's see. "Lipstick lesbian."
I love undercover.
nice and supportive doesn't mean weak.
please.
Jorge...is more submissive than my dog.
Aww, yes, he is! Aww!
maybe I should be a lesbian.
Aww, well, wishes can come true.
frost and korsak wanted to fill out your dating profile.
I typed.
you what?
if it wasn't for me, you would be "butch."
y... you put my photo and profile on a gay-dating website?
it's your best shotat getting DNA and breaking this case.
no, it's our best shot. You're going with me.
no.
Yes, doctor Isles.
W... I don't have time to train a female detective how to collect and preserve DNA.
W... You're going.
there. Look.
all these women think you're hot.
you realize one of these women could be Katie's killer.
and not this one. Listen.
she likes to hike, has season tickets to the Celtics.
what?
front row? Oh, I might flip for that.
I don't understand online dating.
people reveal too much about themselves.
I want to connect with someone who can make me more of who I am.
...who can be strong without needing me to be weak.
I wonder what kind of women we would like if we liked women.
What?!
well, um, first of all, I would be the guy.
because.
because you're bossy?
so are you.
no, I'm not. Yes, you are.
you're just soft and polite when you're bossing people around.
well, it's a good thing you're not my type.
what do you mean I'm not your type?
that is so rude.
well, you don't know how to relax.
and you wear your shoes and your clothes to bed, and you just admitted that you're bossy.
okay, yeah. I'm bossy. Right.
you put my picture and profile on a gay-dating website and I'm bossy.
right. Okay.
after I said no, by the way.
what are you doing?
meditating. It's too stressful to argue with you.
well, just think...
because of you, by this time tomorrow,
I could be on a date with a killer.
it's okay, buddy. It's just me.
what are you doing here?
I guess I fell asleep while I was meditating.
well, at least you don't snore.
Oh, well, you kick.
no, no, no. That's not me.
that was Jorge. She runs in her sleep.
myoclonic contractions.
dogs have dog dreams.
maybe we should take a look and see if...
if anybody else signed up to hook into you.
that's not how you say it. It's "hook up with you."
whatever.
whatever? I'm the one hooking up.
well, pretending to.
that's easy for you to say.
I can't believe I'm actually hoping that the killer wants to meet me.
damn it. Jorge.
Jorge.
Oh, in case I missed his first e-mail...
and his 10th... Jorge.
he's so nice. God.
maybe that's what you need.
you need somebody... Loving and supportive.
like a hamster.
what?
well, I mean, y... What you think of as a "great guy"
is an average woman.
you know, I mean, if I wanted someone to walk the dog with me and talk about my feelings, I would be gay.
you're not gonna say that to him, are you?
I will if you don't. You got me into this, so get me out of it.
please.
Uh-oh. What?
now I understand why you always look like this.
excuse me?
you have nothing to wear.
this is completely appropriate.
Mm. You know, I-it's perfect.
where exactly am I going to hide the camera and the wire?
I know... in my thong.
well, maybe you could wear a brief.
no.
mark twain said, "the clothes make the man."
he also said, "naked people have little or no influence."
this is very serious.
Maura, come on. I-it'll be fine, all right?
w-we're trained professionals. We know what we're doing.
we've actually been undercover a few times before, so, um... let me handle this.
okay. It's fine. You don't want my help.
it's like trying to dress a squirmy 6-year-old, anyway.
everything's too short, too itchy.
I can't walk in that.
Maura, we all love the fact that you dress like you're about to strut down a Paris runway.
it's... it's...Interesting.
it's endearing. Sexy.
it's, uh, it's... it's - it's fashionable.
Oh, so... so that's what you think?
you think this is all about fashion for me?
this is gonna be good.
Um...No? I-I-it's not about fashion?
no, it's not.
what is it about, then?
do you know what I mean?
Yes, the Rizzoli family vacations there every summer.
have you ever tried... to appreciate...
euler's number "e,"
you know, the beautiful equation that connects three constants of mathematics?
have you?
Yeah, I tried it once.
I am in awe of what human beings can do.
I am in awe of... of the hand-knit channel stitching on this sweater.
I am in awe of the artisan who molded and shaped this shoe.
I cannot wait to see what you're gonna wear.
there's a... there's a back room that way. Just...
w-why don't we do it right here? Yeah?
guys must eat you up.
Why? Why do you say that?
cause you're just like them.
beautiful... dominant energy.
if you ever feel like getting adventurous...
I'll... I'll give you a call.
doctor Isles is...
...not very doctorly.
...At all.
your table's ready, miss.
Oh, my God. Put this on.
no. I'm undercover. Follow me.
Oh, my God.
I'll be right back with your.
thank you.
there she goes. First date.
I finally work up the nerve, you know, and call them.
I get the machine.
so I go, "mom, dad..."
I'm gay!
how did you do it?
well...
I...
ladies, may I get you something to drink?
no. We're good.
may I take that for you?
we're good, right, Miranda?
my real name's Mary Anne.
Hi, mom, dad. I'm gay.
whatever happened to "call me back"?
I mean, you leave your most personal information on an answering machine.
a friend of mine asked for a divorce by texting.
no manners anymore. Yeah, you had it down.
so much more polite to serve divorce papers.
I always fall for girls like you.
like what?
Oh, smart, tough...
...Complicated.
mm, my hands are sore from...
volley ball.
you're gonna break my heart.
Mm. Wow. They get right into it.
all they talk about are their feelings.
they're women.
Oh, and you're... you're an expert?
I been married 20 years.
to three different women. So?
so, that's not a very good track record, detective.
Yeah, look where you're spending your Friday night, Romeo.
Oh, real ladies' man.
Rizzoli's good at this.
at what? Being a lesbian? Yeah.
No! Shut up. I'm listening.
no, you're not. You're talking.
Oh, my God!
I like tall brunettes.
I'm Jane.
I know. I saw your profile.
I'm Claire.
uh, can I get you another drink?
no, I've, um... I've had enough to get brave.
the next stage is "weepy."
that's okay. I don't mind.
she is creeping me out.
Rizzoli? No, the other one.
this is gonna freak you out, but you kind of look like that girl who was killed.
Katie...Somebody.
did you see her picture in the paper?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's... it's so scary, isn't it, that...
it could have been any of us.
you want to hear the weirdest part? Yeah.
I think I was her last date.
Really?
reel her in.
did you tell the police?
no, I don't know any thing
w-we chatted online, met up here.
we really hit it off. Then I saw her ring.
I don't hook up with married women.
I don't hook up with "married women"?
she's saying she doesn't cheat.
is that cheating?
are you serious?
well, what was she like?
I really liked her.
she shouldn't have lied about being married.
and if she hadn't...
...she might still be alive.
none of the allele frequencies correspond to the DNA isolated from the 2x4.
the blood on the weapon didn't match any of my dates?
W...Not even Claire? No.
Hey.
CSRU went through Katie's papers.
look at this.
Hey, our victim inherited half a million dollars while she was still single.
she keeps it in the event of a divorce, but if she dies...
it all goes to the grieving widow.
hell of a consolation prize.
widow's got motive.
Yeah, but she's got a titanium alibi.
she can prove she was bowling.
you know, Katie was very careful about controlling her diabetes.
I counted nearly 100 needle sticks.
so it just doesn't make any sense that she wouldn't know she needed Insulin.
maybe she did. Was the pump working?
it was so compromised, I can't tell.
what if... I don't like sentences that begin with "what if.
let's assume...
why is that better?
...that Katie tested herself, her numbers were high, she gave herself some Insulin...
or what she thought was Insulin.
no, b-because I tested the residue in the pump...
pure Insulin.
her tox screen came back negative.
no signs of poisons in Katie's body.
unless... there's something that couldn't be detecte in her bloodstream.
if somebody put something in the pump...
there should be fingerprints on it.
it's clean. Okay.
why aren't Katie's prints on it, at least?
someone might have attached it to her body and wiped it clean.
that's good. I'm just guessing.
all right, so, Katie's regular Insulin pump was switched to one full of poison.
she thinks she's giving herself Insulin.
she's actually killing herself.
who had access to Katie?
Mel, the wife, who was at home when Katie was being beaten.
she had an accomplice. Mm-hmm.
smart killer, because it's impossible to prove without evidence.
which we don't have.
yet.
Katie was here with women, so, obviously, she was cheating.
did you know her wife, Mel?
well, I run a bar, not a church.
you know that, right?
come on.
all right, well, did Katie ever mention anything like she thought Mel was seeing someone?
no, she never did.
sorry.
hmm? No, I'm done. Thank you.
well, um...
you have my number.
Yeah, I do.
if you have any new thoughts...
you know, you said if I was ever feeling adventurous...
yeah? Yeah.
I need you to swab my neck for DNA.
I'm not even going to ask why.
you have 10 seconds. There is a bus coming at you.
you can either be on it or under it.
that cop is fishing. Stay strong.
Yeah, I had to stand there and watch Katie die.
you know...
Hey. Shh, shh, shh. It's okay.
it's okay.
you weren't there. She was... she was so sick.
what did you put in that pump?
fentanyl. It can't be detected.
mixed it with water, swapped out the pumps.
what if we screwed up? We didn't.
look, we get the money in 90 days.
I...
Shh. It's okay, baby.
Hey, wait. What about the fingerprints?
you left prints?
no, that's what I'm worried about.
Katie's prints should have been on the pump, but there were no prints.
wait, how do you know that?
cause she decided to get on the bus.
arms behind your back.
same old story - kill your wife for the money.
how could you do this?
this...Is as adventurous as I get.
crap. Maura. Maura.
look, I-I just want to say that I...
support your choice, Jane.
okay.
thank you.
and thank you for the flowers and the chocolates and...The lunch.
and the car battery, even though mine was fine.
sure. You're welcome.
glad we live in a state that women like you can get married if that's what you want.
okay.
you told him I was gay.
no, he assumed. It's different. Right.
okay, let's begin.
feet shoulder width apart. Relax your shoulders.
he assumed?
just close your eyes and breathe.
and breathe out.
you better hope this calms me down.
well, I could always tell him you like him.
don't you dare.
Oh, I wouldn't dare. Shhhh!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
what are you doing?
caught me. I was eating into the profits.
I told you to leave the load, pick it up in two hours.
sorry. I'm on my way. Wait.
boss wants to meet you first.
sure.
come on.
get on your knees.
don't.
please.
I can forget about it.
put your hands up.
boss wants to see if you can catch.
somebody's here.
Maura, you're staring at Chuck's biceps.
I am.
females are wired to be attracted to the strongest, most dominant males.
it's natural selection at work.
you're making me uncomfortable. Stop.
what? I'm just appreciating his sternocleidomastoid.
excuse me.
you have beautifully developed musculature.
what, am I embarrassing you?
no, not at all. Why don't you tell him he's got a nice ass, too?
and a wonderfully proportioned gluteus maximus.
I am never working out with you again.
right.
Hey, where you going? That was only 20 minutes.
Oh, Bass is ill.
he won't even eat any organic spinach.
I got to go check on him.
you brought your turtle to work?
tortoise.
I couldn't get his usual caregiver.
Rizzoli.
Hey, it's Murray.
hey... Murray. What's up?
can't find your parents about the head count.
figure they must be at church.
head count for what?
the surprise party.
surprise party for who?
whom.
what are you talking about?
Oh, I thought you knew.
sorry, didn't mean to bother you.
too late, I'm bothered.
what? Hey.
know anything about ma and pop throwing a surprise party today?
Oh, no.
"Oh, no" is right.
what is this?
cups. You wanted cups.
why can't you ever do what I ask?
they were 70% off, Ang.
I wanted the toile ones, with the blue-and-green pattern.
it's a cup, Ang. It's a cup!
sorry about that call. I think they wanted to surprise you.
Yeah.
surprise.
I couldn't reach you. What are you doing?
we're gonna have a family get-together, and I was gonna call you the minute we were set up.
Really? Pop, you want to, uh, spit it out.
ask your mother.
he's coming home?
he's getting out today.
bus gets in at 2: 00.
he's getting out early?
for good behavior.
Oh. Too bad he can't behave unless he's behind bars.
don't say that about your brother.
he made a mistake. He served his time.
everybody makes mistakes, Jane.
running a priest down in a crosswalk on your third D.U.I. conviction is not a mistake.
father Crowley has forgiven him.
why can't you?
you're throwing him a party in a bar, mom. Are you crazy?
technically, we're a bar and grill.
and we're only serving soda pop.
I thought that was just till the cake.
what makes you think he's gonna make it out here?
easy, Jane. Take it easy.
she's right. You have to have a plan.
he comes back, he works for me.
Oh, and he sleeps in his bunk bed and plays with his toy soldiers.
Yeah, that ought to straighten him right out, pop.
that's my son, and it's your brother.
look, if you and Frankie don't want to come, don't.
fine. Not coming.
me either.
you're gonna turn your back on this family?
come on, ma.
ma. Ma, we're both cops.
you can't expect us to do this.
Rizzoli.
what?
what? Oh, no.
okay. What happened?
we got a cop shot.
Danny Clark, drug control unit.
he was in my class at the academy.
wife, two kids.
knew his father. I knew Danny since he was this tall.
it's a damn shame.
one shot to the head.
looks like a large-caliber firearm.
it's a 45-caliber.
abrasions on his sternum.
and some hair's missing.
there's a piece of tape. Hey, Joe.
photograph this, mark it, and bag it, okay?
he was wearing a wire.
he was working for us.
homicide?
Yeah. Since when?
I sent him under to get information about the two dead truckers from Charlestown you were working.
my case? Without telling me?
it's my decision.
everyone fall in over here.
what the hell?
let's go.
I want every cop and detective down here working the streets on this.
get everyone from headquarters.
the only cop I want there is Manning the front desk until further notice.
you. You!
if you'd kept us together on this, Danny wouldn't be dead.
come on, easy, easy. He wouldn't be dead!
you better have a good reason for sending him in alone.
a good reason.
look, I need you, Rizzoli.
Yes, sir.
I want you to interview Bobby.
he may not even know what he knows.
now, you're the best at this.
take him to headquarters.
I- I can interview him here.
no, no, no, no. Get him out of here.
Yes, sir.
I know. I know.
Jane. Yeah?
that's the only thing I found in his pockets.
okay.
I'll, uh... I'll bag it and get it to evidence.
Frankie, you want to...?
Hey, man, come on, come on. Let's... let's go.
okay?
Ugh! Sunday.
what? No, no, no. No, no, no.
$20's, uh, overkill.
you're only a jerk if you don't leave anything. Here.
God, when was that made? November?
marino wants a cup of coffee. There's none upstairs.
guy's a wreck.
I've tried everything...
british strawberries, Fennel, Bok Choy.
are... are we in the same conversation?
sorry. I-I was talking about bass.
Oh. You're obsessing over your turtle again?
tortoise.
he likes salt in his coffee?
Oh, damn it.
you know, when people lock their keys in their car or sprain their ankle, usually indicates that something significant is bothering them.
Yeah. A cop was murdered.
Yeah. But that's...
that's not why you're salting your coffee.
it's my brother Tommy.
I always wondered about him.
well, Frankie and I became cops.
and Tommy went to prison for hitting a priest in a crosswalk.
Oh.
it was his third strike while driving under the influence.
your poor parents.
and, you know, they keep saying, "if the priest that he hit has forgiven him, then why can't we?
this isn't about forgiveness.
you know, Tommy is - is really troubled.
and the more they deny it, the more he screws up.
you really care about him.
I just think that we need to face reality.
you know, Tommy needs help.
this isn't like he broke his leg and it'll heal.
I'm really sorry.
thank you.
don't worry about it. Come on.
we got too much to do today to worry about Tommy.
you wish you were out there?
Yeah.
we'll get the shooter.
I'll call you as soon as I get the results.
all right.
Oh, I got to log this into evidence.
I got to take this to Marino.
I'll see you later.
Jane. Yeah?
if you want to talk about your brother...
or just avoid the subject, I'm here.
I know.
according to Danny's notes, you guys were making in roads into the trucker homicides.
why'd you stop working the case?
Cavanaugh pulled me off the murders.
went back to working drugs in Charlestown.
and then there's - there's nothing.
do you know what was Danny doing for Cavanaugh?
beats me.
got real secretive all of a sudden.
what? You guys were partners for years.
why would he shut you out?
we were partners for nine years.
Danny was the best.
I know.
but...
I mean, you worked drugs. You know what it's like.
all that money's...
well, I knew Danny, too, Bobby. What are you trying to say?
Hey. Help me out here.
I think Danny was dirty.
yeah?
sector six officers brought in a woman they arrested outside the warehouse last night.
what, where Danny was shot?
Yep. They grabbed her for crack.
she says that she can give up the shooter.
if we broom her case?
Yeah.
she's waiting in the interview room.
okay.
want me to go talk to her?
Yeah, yeah. All right.
okay, I'll be right back.
Bobby. Hey.
did you see his face?
I'm not saying anything until I know that I'm not doing time.
you withhold information about the murder of a Boston cop, and you're going back - no trial, no nothing.
you'll be eating dinner in jail.
he was a cop? I didn't know that he was a cop, okay?
this is bad. This is really bad.
this is so bad!
sit down. You're not going anywhere.
did you see his face?
Yeah.
I did... the both of them.
they are really bad guys. They're really bad guys.
and they're gonna come here, and they're gonna kill me.
can you pick them out?
Yeah.
but I don't know what to do. What am I supposed to do?
okay. I have no p- What am I supposed to do?
okay, listen to me.
if they were willing to shoot a cop, they won't think twice about killing you.
okay, thanks. I'll let them know.
what can I do for you, fellas?
Yeah, my vehicle got towed. How do I get it back?
you have to head over to division.
get his weapon.
set up the cellphone jammer. Kill the power.
go to the roof. Take out the antenna and the junction box.
keep eyes on the streets.
you, cover the back exit by the morgue.
you're coming with me. We don't have much time.
Oh, my God. They're here! What? No.
they're here. I told you.
I told you. It's a power failure. Calm...
no, they're here.
everybody meet at the loading docks in 10 minutes.
go.
Jimmy, the power's out.
get his weapon.
let's go.
Oh, shoot!
the power's out, okay?
Hey, buddy, but I still need you to eat something.
sweetie, here we go. Come on, sweetie.
there. Quick, quick!
right there in the evidence locker.
hit it.
I don't see.
damn it!
it's not here. Let's go.
they know I'm here. They know I'm here!
I got to get out of here!
I got to get out of here. No.
I'm getting out of here. I got to get out of here right now.
my gun.
come on, go. Go to that door.
go, go.
I got to get out of here!
go up!
I got to get out of here. I got to get out of here.
go up! Go up! Up, up, up.
I'm going.
there, right there. Go in the corner.
Yeah. Shh.
don't leave me. Don't leave me.
okay.
okay.
don't go.
I got to go back down there and help them, okay?
I will be right back. You're safer here.
don't leave me.
don't leave me.
are you okay?
she's dead.
got here a second too late.
not for me. Thank you. Can you walk?
Yeah.
but we can't get out of here.
they're watching all the exits.
who are they?
I don't know.
I told her I could protect her.
if they were here to kill a witness, why aren't they gone?
What'd she say?
she said she saw Danny's shooter.
said she could I. D. him.
you get a name?
no, no, nothing.
they ripped apart all the desks in the squad room.
what are they looking for?
I don't know.
the, uh... that walkie - is it working?
only channel 12. All homicide is out of range.
what do you think?
I got to find Maura and get her out of here.
it's Jane. It's Jane.
Jane. I was hiding.
there are men. There are men shooting in here.
Yeah. Both of them have been shot.
no, I'm fine, I'm fine. Take care of him.
Oh, my God. What happened? He's been hit twice.
it's all right. My vest stopped it.
okay, get him up here.
the table? Already? Really? The dead-person table?
come on.
God. Okay, careful. Careful, careful.
keep this, okay? A- and watch the doors.
I'm gonna stay with Frankie.
okay.
take his shirt off.
Jane, what is going on?
the phones don't work. There are men shooting here.
I know, I know.
and I think we're trapped in here.
what about that?
no, that's... that's only for homicide cops, and... and no one's in range.
okay, lift his shirt up.
okay, okay, okay.
I think I just got the wind knocked out of me. That's all.
you sure did.
hand us that binder - the binder on the desk.
we need to keep his head up.
Jane, give me your jacket. Okay.
careful, okay? We're gonna put you down. All right.
okay, got your head.
lower your head. It's okay.
got it? Okay.
ABC's...
airway, breathing, circulation.
I should've taken an emergency-medicine rotation.
all right, take a deep breath.
I- I-I can't.
what are you hearing?
okay.
J- Jane, you can't... Hey.
it's all... it's fine, okay?
it's fine.
it's bad, isn't it?
massive blunt-force trauma caused internal bleeding.
it's worse than bad.
Peruvian flake always looks like mother of pearl.
why'd they leave the drugs?
killed a cop. Something must've spooked them.
was there a drug aspect to your two murders?
no.
investigation showed random shootings...
two truckers hauling freight from New York.
I don't want anybody in here who doesn't belong.
I want you to go over this truck top to bottom...
obviously, there's a lot more to this case.
I want the wheels checked, everything.
why wouldn't Cavanaugh tell you he was putting Danny undercover?
I don't know!
but what do you want to bet my two dead truckers were muling coke?
what do you think Cavanaugh had to do with it?
nothing, I hope.
let's find out.
pull up Danny's files on the truckers.
why does everybody always use their birth date? Here it is.
got their application for commercial driver's licenses.
when did they join the interstate truckers union?
both got their I.T.U. cards 18 months ago...
on the same day.
check the union-card prints, see if either one of them has a criminal record.
didn't you check their autopsy prints?
of course I did. They came up clean.
just run the union-card prints, would you?
they're clean, too.
okay.
compare the prints from his union card with the prints we took at the autopsy.
can't fake your prints when you're dead.
look at those whorl patterns.
there is no way those are from the same guy.
did Danny keep their files in his personal records?
right here.
okay, open those.
look at this.
our trucker has multiple arrests for possession of class-B cocaine.
he used someone else's prints to get his license.
somebody pulled their records off the system.
and somehow Danny got hold of them.
call Jane. I want to talk to Bobby.
getting voicemail.
she's probably still interviewing him.
see what Danny has on our second dead trucker.
I need an MRI or CT scan, an - an X-ray machine...
something to check his internal injuries.
I was afraid of that.
what?
tension pneumothorax.
Maura, he's having trouble breathing. Do something.
I'm a pathologist. I am not a surgeon.
Jane, I could make it worse.
what is it again? Say it again.
t- tension pneumothorax. Okay.
what are you doing?
tension pneumothorax results in death if not... if not treated immediately.
Oh, God.
Jane, I'm just guessing, okay?
I... I would need to confirm it.
you don't have time to confirm it!
your guess is better than most doctors'.
I could be wrong.
aggressively manage with needle decompression to chest.
I've never done it. Maura!
Geez! G-get a needle. Do it.
do it now! All right.
get a... get alcohol and a cotton ball and... and tape.
I got it. I got it.
all right, now, hold on, okay? Okay.
okay, okay.
give me the tape.
okay, hold this.
Hey, bud. Hey, buddy.
you're okay.
Hey, you're all right. You're all right.
the integrity of his chest wall has been breached by a broken rib.
we got to get him to a hospital.
there's at least three men inside this building, maybe more outside.
what are they carrying?
I saw two MP5s.
N- no. No. No, he looks better. He... he looks better.
no, not for long.
I think he has a partial tear on one of his lungs, maybe other internal organs.
which... which means what?
it means that he needs surgery.
how soon?
now!
Hey, Ang.
remember when we took the kids to Lake Winnipesaukee?
you know, when we took them all fishing?
Yes. And we had the rowboat that leaked.
Oh, yeah!
and Janie caught that largemouth bass, you know?
she was holding it up. She was so proud.
Oh, God, and Tommy had to throw it back in because he didn't want that fish to die.
I still believe that person is inside of him.
Yeah. Me too, honey.
is that me?
Hello?
Oh, baby, it's so good to hear your voice.
what?
of course you are.
we're all here waiting for you.
w- what's he saying, Ang? G- give me the phone.
Tommy, please. Tommy.
we are all so happy that you're coming home.
Hey, give me the phone.
Tommy, listen to me.
Tommy, you come home!
gimme.
what? T-Tommy, no.
no. W... listen.
don't do this to your mother.
Tommy, please.
Danny and Bobby both worked Charlestown for nine years.
Yeah. And both our dead truckers lived in Charlestown.
any connection to Danny or Bobby?
nothing I can find.
Cavanaugh worked Charlestown.
I want to talk to Bobby. Try Jane again.
voicemail.
try the front desk.
getting a recording.
I don't like it. Come on, let's go back to headquarters.
it's okay, buddy. We're gonna get you out of here.
there's blood clotting it.
Oh, turn him on his side! What's happening?!
Oh, my God.
his lung is filling up with blood.
well, how do we stop it?
we can't. We need a trauma center.
I- I-I don't have equipment for this.
but you helped him before.
the problem is his heart right now, Jane, okay?
there's too much pressure from the bleeding.
his heart can't pump.
Gah! Please don't let him die, Maura, please.
we... we can't get him out of here, okay?
what can you do right now that will help him?
I don't know!
I don't know what more I can do with what I have!
he is going to die right here on this table if you don't do something... Think!
okay. Okay.
you're the only one that can save him.
it's all right, buddy. All right.
Rizzoli's car is still here.
Where's it coming from?!
on the roof! North and south corners!
get to the radio. Why me?
on me. I'm closer to retirement. You ready?
go!
we're taking fire!
we got shooters on the roof of headquarters!
get me some help down here now!
this is a hospital procedure.
okay. Just do it.
I don't have anesthetic.
it's all right, Maura. Just do the best you can, okay?
this is gonna hurt, okay?
I have to drain the blood from your lung so you can breathe.
Maura, hurry.
I need you to hold him down for me.
okay.
it's okay, bud. It's all right.
have to insert the tube to drain the blood. Okay.
we trust you.
this is painful.
okay. Bud, listen to me.
Hey, hey! Look at me, all right?
this is gonna hurt, okay?
I want you to squeeze my hand as hard as you can, Frank.
get down! Shooter on the roof!
what do we got? A mess is what we got!
you tell me right now what you had to do with this!
if you're any part of it, I'll kill you myself!
who the hell you think you're talking to?!
I sent Danny in there by himself!
his murder's on me!
okay.
we got to get people out.
we think Rizzoli and Marino are in there.
Dr. Isles and Frankie are probably in there, too.
one shooter at the rear entry to the morgue.
snipers are moving into position. How many inside?
we've got a visual on one, in the lobby.
got to figure out how to communicate.
we're gonna go old school. Use channel 12.
frost, give me a walkie.
Jane never carries hers!
maybe we'll get lucky.
Jane, you hear me?
Jane, can you hear me?
do you copy?
Korsak, is that you?
Jane. Where are you?
w- we're in the autopsy room.
are you okay?
we got a-at least two dead, two wounded.
Marino's got a gunshot wound to the thigh.
Frankie took two to the chest. He's... he's hurt real bad.
can you hold them off, Jane?
not for long.
th-they're looking for something.
Oh, wait, wait.
they... they... they were looking for something in the evidence lockers.
B- but they didn't find whatever it is.
what, you're telling me this now?
I'm sorry. I kind of had my hands full.
Jane, did you log in any evidence from the crime scene?
only the - the pack of cigarettes, but I haven't logged them in yet.
Why? What... what do they want with Danny's cigarettes?
Danny doesn't smoke. His old man died of lung cancer.
so there's something in the cigarette pack.
Yeah, like what? Where is it?
Oh, it's right here.
drop it.
you...
drop the radio.
Jane? Jane, what's happening?!
give me the cigarettes.
you got till I count to three, or this cop is dead.
one...
two... Aah!
all right, all right! They're right there.
don't you screw with me.
just stop, all right?
they're in my jacket, under his head.
get them.
it's all right.
here.
give them to Bobby.
smile.
you're on Danny's camera.
Danny didn't know that you were running the drug ring, but he must've suspected something.
that's why he was wearing a wire and carrying a hidden camera.
he just couldn't stop digging.
that was Danny.
I wasn't planning on killing him, but he showed up at the warehouse.
he didn't leave me any choice.
you killed the other witness, too, didn't you?
what's one less crack whore, right?
you son of a bitch.
Nah. I'm not a son of a bitch.
I'm a freakin' hero.
now that I got what I need...
...I'm just gonna sit tight...
and wait to be rescued.
that is, after I shoot the three of you.
I wouldn't do that, Bobby.
Bobby, it's over.
sniper 1, you've got a green light on that shot.
take it.
get your team into the morgue now!
team 1, move, move, move! Team 3, move, move!
come on, come on. No, no, no, no!
it's fine.
tell them to hold their fire!
hold your fire! Hold your fire!
I've got a visual - one shooter, one hostage.
Bobby, let her go! It's over!
can you make the shot?
he's got her too tight.
Bobby, please, this is over! Please!
drop the gun, Bobby! Don't make it worse on yourself!
let her go!
please! Frankie is bleeding!
shut up and do it! Take out your keys!
shoot him!
just shoot him!
put your guns down, or she's dead!
no, don't! Frankie's bleeding! There's no time!
your brother's probably already dead.
No-o-o!
kill her.
kill her. She's done.
you're wicked.
burn her. Burn her.
Boston police department
okay.
egg whites for you, doctor, and house special for you, honey.
thanks... Honey.
at...
okay. You know what?
at work, make normal pancakes.
I'd love bunny pancakes.
do not encourage her.
so we're clear, no zoo-animal shapes at work.
rabbits are not zoo animals.
well, except for the Washington pygmy, which is being bred in captivity.
talk about breeding...
I could make bunny pancakes for grandchildren.
mom.
you know what that means.
drop a fork, expect a female visitor.
are you still menstruating, Mrs. Rizzoli?
wha- Maura! God. No.
other kind of visitor- The person kind.
she's very superstitious, my mother.
she believes in all that stuff about cats and umbrellas and ladders.
had me convinced I was gonna paralyze her if I stepped on a crack.
step on a crack, break your mother's back.
you believed that?
I was 5.
don't you have other customers?
Oh, my God. What is she doing here?
who's that? Frankie's ex.
Oh. Looks like your mother likes her.
uh, no.
that would be her "I can't stand you" hug.
but she way too polite to call her the word that rhymes with "witch.
bitch? Shh! - Jane?
look who I found!
Theresa, how, uh, how you doing?
long time.
what are you doing here at...
Boston police headquarters? - Just moved back to town.
and you just thought you pop by the police department?
job application.
Ah. You're being fingerprinted?
it's mandatory for everyone applying.
sure. Sure.
especially for people who have other people co-sign a car loan and then default on that loan.
good seeing you, too, Jane.
see you around.
you just gave her your "I can't stand you" hug.
Sheesh. Uncomfortable.
you want uncomfortable?
try paying off Theresa's car loan while she skips town and leaves you holding the bag.
well, perhaps you should've had her fingerprinted first.
no. Not me.
Frankie. It's the love of his life.
she's very symmetrical.
excuse me?
well, studies have shown that women who have symmetrical facial features are the most attractive to men.
you're not helping.
okay. I'll be right there.
yummy.
Theresa's back to get her manipulative claws in Frankie.
maybe she came by to pay back the car loan. People change.
Oh, yeah. That's it. Maybe she added seven years of interest.
what have we got?
fire investigators think it was set in the middle of the night.
did you find an I. D? - No.
he can't even... He can't even tell if it's male or female.
it's interesting.
might have to do a full autopsy before I can tell the gender.
I don't know. This is definitely male.
Oh, no.
the less-pronounced supraorbital ridges indicate female.
Yes! Okay.
so our victim's definitely female. That is not fair.
so an accelerant was used.
not gasoline. Lighter fluid, maybe?
variation on pugilistic pose indicates that her wrists and her ankles were bound.
I think she died right here. There's no sign of drag marks.
think she was alive when she was set on fire?
I know, I know. You need time and endless tests.
one thing's for sure...
we're not gonna get any fingerprints.
pine scent.
it's right where a jacket pocket would be.
think she was wearing air freshener?
no. I think it might be Amber.
what's the shiny thing?
Fixed-bearing prosthesis.
it's a titanium joint.
it's a knee replacement.
we don't need fingerprints. We got a serial number.
Thanks.
manufacturer shipped the knee joint to a Boston orthopedic group.
they're checking patient records.
should have a name any second.
we're distinguish our victim by her knee replacement.
cool.
so, how's everything?
good.
anything... new today?
Nope. Not a thing.
was she here to see you?
who? - You know who.
you guys want some privacy? I can...
what, you mean because my sister is butting into my business?
I knew it. You were meeting with Theresa if you guys are gonna fight right now...
she was here getting fingerprinted for a job. And it's none of your business.
did she pay you back for that Camry? Also not your business.
you bought a car for a chick?
Mm-hmm. - Dumb, bro.
excuse me, bro.
we had to scrape him off the ceiling every time hurricane Theresa blew into his life.
Oh, you want to go there. Fine.
let's talk about Steve Sanner.
who's Steve Sanner? - No one.
Oh, she was nuts about him.
she started wearing dresses. You should've heard her on the phone.
Hi. Steve?
I'm, like, good. You?
OOP. Hello.
implant belonged to Helen Downey, 43.
she's got a license but no car.
she lived in Hyde Park.
that's close to where we found her. Let's go check it out.
bro.
car?
you need to put your shoulder into it. Please. Show me.
that's a new guy's job. I've been the new guy for two years.
I will tell you when you're not the new guy anymore.
there's no sign of struggle, so Helen wasn't taken by force.
what is that smell? Kitty litter box. Needs changing.
Kitty! Kitty! Kitty! Kitty! Kitty! Kitty!
Kitty!
pretty little kitty-kitty.
Oh, no. I don't like black cats.
it's not a black thing. It's just... It's your cat baby talk.
hello... Worthington.
you're a good boy.
poor guy.
she painted his nails pink? Oh, they're nail caps.
keep you from tearing the furniture.
hmm. That, to me, says that Worthington was an inside cat.
epicurean cat. Pampered, too.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, this cat's hungry.
he's been alone for at least 24 hours.
it's walking distance to the clearing where we found her.
so maybe Helen knew her killer and met him there.
not much of a social butterfly, that Helen.
didn't do much entertaining.
box of historical records. This goes back to...
man. Look at this.
1690. Looks original.
she kept everything. Piles of mail, too.
I'll get Crime Scene Response to box it up and bring it in.
where does this go? It's locked.
Hey, new guy.
if I end up on disability, it's on you.
Korsak, that looks like disability.
Oh, this reminds me of "The Devil's Rejects."
you ever see that one? - I hate horror films.
haven't you got enough on your mind? Hm. You're missing out.
ever see, uh, "Zombies Invade Boston"?
how is it you can't look at a dead body but you can watch zombies chew their own arms off?
Hi, Maura.
crime lab identified the substance in Helen's pocket.
fossilized tree resin... Amber.
okay. That's great. But I'm a little busy right now.
Oh, you got to see this.
can you see what we're looking at?
that table looks like an altar.
that looks like a human skull.
I have Helen's cause of death. What was it?
did she die by curse? - No.
I found soot lining her airway, edema in her lung tissue.
Maura, is it possible that Helen Downey was burned at the stake?
Why?
because I think Helen Downey was a witch.
it's blood, right? I don't know yet.
well, why did you rush all the way over here if you're gonna take as long as you take in your lab?
can you hover somewhere else?
somebody did get a visitor today.
look at all these weird things.
I had these crazy wiccan neighbors. Aggressive bunch.
they took all the parking spaces.
do you think Helen was a wiccan witch?
wicca is a Neo-pagan religion.
its practitioners use white magic to bring about good.
this altar doesn't look like it's up to anything good.
I agree.
it suggests a darker, more traditional form of witchcraft.
I don't even want to know how you know that.
phenolphthalein test indicates it is blood.
human? This is an altar, not a crime lab.
these bones have holes in them. Perforations.
this is from an articulated skeleton.
connected... like for a science classroom.
Yes. It's perfectly legal. You can buy it on eBay.
Yeah, but you can't buy bowls of blood on eBay.
well, those who practice the dark arts give blood to use in spells.
again, never tell me how you know this.
black is used to cast an evil spell.
is that hair and fingernails?
Mm. A love spell.
Helen never heard of online dating?
what's this for?
amber. It's used to ward off disease.
that's the same stuff that we found on Helen.
okay. What is she doing to this guy?
angelica root. It's used for protection.
so we've got evil, healing, love, and protection.
adds up to one weird victim.
you had to take a witch's cat.
I'm fostering Baretta till he can find a loving home.
didn't want to go through life as Worthington.
Mm. He tell you that? What else he tell you?
leave him alone. He's the sweetest cat in the world.
Helen collected genealogies.
look at these family trees.
this is incredible. Look at the date... 1692.
that's when the Salem witch trials began. Maybe Helen was descended from witches.
take any history at Southie High?
puritans persecuted anybody who was different.
Yeah. Witchcraft was a felony punishable by death.
Oh, okay. This is cool, too.
it's a deed of trust from the land where we found Helen's body.
it's been modified, but the original date is 1680.
the land where Helen was killed belonged to her family for centuries.
three acres in Hyde park. What's that worth?
a lot. She could used the money, too.
letters from her landlord. She was behind in her rent.
Helen was a descendant of William and Mary Warrick.
Wow. Early settlers of Salem.
land was passed to her through all these generations.
slaves came with it back in the day.
good times in colonial Boston.
Hey, women were considered property.
what are you looking at me for? I don't even have a cleaning lady.
what's with the registered letters? All from the same guy.
real estate agent. Robert Cranston.
Hi. I'm Robert Cranston. And if you...
Hey, that's the guy that's getting the evil curse in Helen's basement.
he's also a real estate developer who's been buying up all the land around Helen's property.
what for? - He's building a monster mall there.
he offered Helen $3 million for her land.
so he owns all the parcels except Helen's Lone holdout.
looks like Helen kept him from building his mall. That cost him.
do you have her will yet?
no. - Okay.
she's not married. No will.
maybe Cranston can't get her land unless he kills her and buys it from the estate.
well, that would be an offer she couldn't refuse.
we appreciate you coming in. I don't have a lot of time.
we're going to need to know where you were Saturday... day and nighttime.
I was in Worcester, at the grand-opening celebration of my newest gated community.
and then I was asleep at my hotel. Check. You'll see.
could you turn that off, please?
it's business. I do a lot of it.
did you ever meet with Helen Downey? Once. That was enough. She's nuts.
cause she wouldn't sell her property to you?
I offered her $3 million for that weed patch...
double what it was worth. She said it was sacred.
why did she think it was sacred?
something to do with her ancestors, witches.
who knows? Whack job.
we're investigating Helen Downey's murder.
am I under arrest?
no.
then I know both my rights and my way out.
too bad we can't hold him for being a sleazebag.
guy that rich wouldn't dirty his own hands.
Yeah. Probably not. He'd hire somebody.
I'll check out his alibi, run background checks on his employees.
the blood in the bowl didn't belong to Helen.
any chance we'll get a DNA hit? - Possibly.
I'm still waiting on the results from the fingernails and hair from the altar.
did you find anything to confirm that Helen was crazy?
Korsak said that the real estate developer claims she was a nut bar.
you know, the genetics of mental illnesses are much more complex than the genetics of many of the rare, single-gene diseases.
"yes" or "no..." Perfectly good answers.
no.
I'm going as fast as I can.
three sandwiches. Big lunch.
Yeah. I'm meeting some people.
is that why you're wearing all that cologne?
it's quite lovely.
hints of orange blended with notes of cedar and...
verbena.
Yeah. Thanks. Ma, I got to run.
okay.
see ya. Bye.
enjoy! Where's he off to?
a picnic at the public gardens.
is it with Theresa? - Oh, I hope not.
I mean, how could he not remember how much pain she put me through?
you?
ma, he was depressed for months when she found a new guy and dumped him on his ass... again.
I remember. - That can be quite serious.
broken heart syndrome, also known as stress cardiomyopathy.
it can cause rapid and severe heart-muscle weakness.
Oh, my God. You got to do something.
you see him? No.
it's hot, and I smell like a French fry.
that's because we're in direct sunlight.
I know that, 007. That's why I'm hot.
you feel that? Ventilation fan.
magic.
no.
solar panels on the roof of my car.
they automatically generate enough electricity to cool us off.
how green. Isn't it?
does it get rid of French-fry smell?
how is it that you can't lie but you can talk me into spying on my brother?
we're not spying. - We're not.
we are gathering data to test a hypothesis, which is the first step of scientific inquiry.
nice try.
we... you and I... are snooping, meddling.
we are sticking our noses where they do not belong.
Oh, my God.
I just turned into my mother.
hypothesis confirmed...
I would recognize that cheap dye job anywhere.
it's Korsak. Rizzoli.
and Isles.
we found Helen Downey's will.
she left her land to three people. They all live in old Salem.
sending you the photos now.
see the goofball with all the piercings? Yeah.
Grayson Bennett, 33.
who's the beautiful one with the lip stud?
sage Molette, 29. And the young one is Sabrina Scott.
Sabrina is a very old Welsh name.
it's also a name of the teenage witch.
all three of them work at the Spellbox.
Oh, that's an occult store. What, you shop there?
I've bought gifts.
got to go.
Hi. What are you doing here? You followed me.
we did.
but we're just testing a hypothesis. We are not snooping.
Oh, really? What's your hypothesis?
if I meet Theresa for lunch, it's your business?
no, we were trying to determine whether you're getting back together.
please stop talking. Hypotheses require rigorous testing. It's...
you want to know what I'm doing here? - No.
fine.
this is my daughter.
Lily, say hi to your Aunt Jane.
hi
hello.
you want a french fry?
no. My mom says they make you look fat.
Lily is adorable.
she looks like Frankie.
Yeah, she's really cute.
and innocent, unlike her mother.
my gut says Theresa's broke and she's using her kid to get Frankie back.
paternity is very easy to check.
Oh, sure, Maura. I'll just ask Lily for a little saliva.
we got a lot of work to do. Let's get to Salem.
they call it "city of peace" now.
that's very nice of them, since they put 19 innocent people to death in the witch trials.
what? Salem was my favorite field trip.
I've been there six times.
I can't believe she's gone.
what was your relationship to Helen Downey?
we were members of the same coven.
make sure to get the names of the other nine.
what? - "Coven."
it's the middle English word for "convent."
it's an assembly of 13 witches.
are there 13 members of your coven?
only four.
but Helen was working on building our membership.
we're hereditary witches.
that means... - Six field trips.
I got this. Okay.
that means you inherited your practices and rituals and magic from ancestors.
that explains all the genealogy stuff we found at Helen's.
would it surprise you to know that Helen named the three of you in her will?
no. We were her family.
and yet there's only a photo of you on her altar.
seems she was attempting a love spell.
were you ever involved with Helen?
Yes.
but I realized for our coven to function...
each of our lives had to be equally intertwined.
did you all intertwine in Helen's basement?
we performed rituals. Yes.
okay.
we're gonna need to collect DNA samples from you.
I'm gonna need to swab the inside of your mouths, if that's all right.
also, do any of you recognize this man?
it's the Reverend William Scott.
that's your last name, isn't it? Is he your father?
Yes. Were you aware that Helen had cast a protective spell against him?
my father wasn't happy that I had joined.
did your father ever make any threats against Helen?
he would never hurt anyone. He's a man of God.
man of God.
same men who've persecuted us for hundreds of years.
do you know of anyone that would want Helen dead?
you know what? Why don't we ask Helen?
we'll have one tonight... at her home.
you're welcome to attend.
what ever happened to the good old-fashioned interrogation?
come on. It'll be fun.
like traveling to Borneo.
investigative work is not supposed to be fun.
that's why they call it "work." Borneo? Really?
well, my work is fun.
you think Frankie told your mom? - No way.
did you hear the good news? I'm a grandmother.
isn't it wonderful? - Okay.
ma, slow down, all right? Isn't she adorable?
she uses a napkin and she chews with her mouth closed.
unlike her mother.
listen, Lily can't help it her mother is a bit... a-a bit flaky.
look, let's let bygones be bygones.
it's very healthy to move past old grievances.
no one asked you.
and I'm not ready to withdraw my grievances against Theresa.
doctor Isles...
could I possibly trouble you to host a little family get-together?
no. - Of course.
thank you. What was that?
hospitality? No, Ms. Buttinsky. It was butting in.
got Helen's phone records. - Oh.
Sabrina's father, the reverend, called her hundreds of times in the last six months.
so he was harassing Helen.
Helen convinced my daughter she had inherited mystical powers.
how's she do that?
Helen found Sabrina, showed her our family ancestry.
my daughter didn't know we are related to Sarah Good.
the Sarah Good...
who was put to death for witchcraft in 1692?
you don't believe your ancestor was a witch, do you?
I know that Sarah Good was a devil worshiper.
that's what Helen was, too.
she made my daughter reject her faith and her family.
that must made you angry.
Yes.
and it also broke my heart.
in her restraining order, Sabrina said you tried to abduct her.
I hired a deprogrammer.
I was trying to get her away from those that were leading her astray.
can you blame me?
only if you killed Helen Downey.
as God as my witness, I did not.
well, don't go anywhere. We may need to speak to you again.
okay. Let's put someone on him 24/7.
guy gives me the creeps, too.
Ugh. What is she doing?
a feeding ritual.
in the Hua society of New Guinea, feeding and sexual intercourse are believed to transfer the vital essence, nu.
I'm leaving if sexual intercourse is next.
I'm not. Me either.
we call upon the powers that be to open a doorway to the other side and allow us to conjure, stir, and summon the spirit of Helen Downey.
I don't like this.
it's okay.
if you get scared, you can hold my hand.
Helen...Are you with us?
fig.
Ooh. Spooky.
I just had one in your honor, Helen.
she loved figs.
no kidding.
no, Maura. No kidding.
Helen, do you know who killed you?
Yes.
how reliable is that thing? I am your vessel.
tell me... Who killed you, Helen?
my killer... is near!
Helen said her killer was near.
Really? "Helen said"?
well, you're right.
that sounded a little silly. - A little.
I don't suppose you've heard of the ideomotor effect.
sure. That's when idiots pretend to talk to the dead.
unconscious muscular actions in response to a thought or idea.
it could be why the board moved.
fake. Phony.
like Theresa, who I now get to watch chew with her mouth open, thanks to you.
okay. It's heavy.
okay!
Frankie, you get to do the honors. You sure?
Yeah.
okay.
ma's never let anybody but pop cut the meat before.
well, now that Frankie is a father.
we don't know that, Maura.
so, how's the job interview go? - Good.
they said they'd let me know by the end of the week.
so, uh, you looking into the food-service industries?
I haven't worked in a fast-food restaurant in years.
I'm in medicine now. Medicine? Really?
I'm a nurse. Oh. Nurse's aide.
Oh, wow. That's great.
so you, like, change sheets and empty bedpans... That sort of stuff?
I'm getting certified. That's wonderful.
I'm sure you're a very nurturing person.
Yeah, that's... that's what we've always said about her.
isn't that right, mom? - Hmm?
we sure did. Would you like a potato?
so, uh, what brings you back to Boston?
I wanted my daughter to have some stability.
be around family, you know?
of course. Family is the...
how are your parents?
thank you.
Wow. Lily, my goodness. You are so grown-up.
how old are you?
seven. - Seven?
you are almost as old as your mommy's Camry.
Jane, come help me in the kitchen.
I'm not finished. This will just take a second.
Hey, Frankie, get me some more wine.
uh, Lily, would... would you like some more milk?
Yes, please. I'll get it for you, baby.
she is so well-mannered.
that's the mother of my child. You sure about that?
she's always taken advantage of you, lied to you... cheated on you.
will you stop? - No!
I can't stand to see this happen again... Not to you and not to that little girl.
Lily is not some car you can buy with Theresa.
she deserves to know the truth, Frankie, and so do you.
you are really lucky there's company around.
Frankie. Come... come here!
Yeah, Frost. What's up? What? When?
all right. We'll be right there.
what's the matter?
we got to go. Another witch got attacked.
get your purse. What?
get your purse.
Oh, my God. I'm going straight to hell.
I'm stealing the sippy cup.
go to the car. Go.
we know what happened? - Sabrina was alone, closing out the register, when she was attacked.
was it a robbery? - Don't think so. The money's still there.
she was lucky. Weren't for that sculpture, she'd have been crushed to death. I want to talk to her.
she's pretty shook up. - Okay.
Hi, Sabrina.
you remember me? I'm detective Rizzoli.
I'm a doctor. I can check her out.
Hi, Sabrina.
can you follow my light with your eyes?
can you tell us what happened?
I...
I don't know.
do you remember how the bookcase fell over?
someone pushed it onto me.
did you see who that was? No.
I heard a voice. Was it a male or a female voice?
what did the voice say?
thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
she needs a cat scan.
this bookcase weighs hundreds of pounds.
somebody strong must have pushed it on her. Question is, how did they get in?
door was locked. Police officers had to break in.
Helen the witch is burned alive.
Sabrina almost gets crushed to death.
maybe this is a witch-hunt. I think it's a real estate hunt.
look what I found by the cash register. Well, well, well.
our sleazebag real estate agent stopped by.
well, you said Helen's will divided her land evenly between the three coven members.
you think Cranston was trying to get all three to sell?
if he was, my money's on Grayson.
Sabrina and Sage don't pee without his permission.
he had the motive, the muscle, and the keys to this place.
let's go find him.
Hey. New guy.
Boston police!
you're the only other one with a key to the Spellbox.
no... no, it's not me.
I didn't do this.
I was in Needham teaching a candle-making class.
Sabrina's dead, isn't she?
no.
she's in the hospital.
they're trying to kill us.
it's as it was before... Burning, pressing... drowning.
all means of execution for witches.
there aren't any witches.
I'm scared.
I'm so scared.
real estate developer has got a solid alibi. What about the reverend?
police officer says he never left his house.
we don't have enough to hold her.
you're free to go. No. No. Please.
can I please stay here? That's a first.
suspect who wants to spend the night.
I'm so afraid. Please.
maybe we put her up in a hotel until all this is over.
what about my cats?
can't leave your cats.
you live in Salem, right? We'll escort you home.
we'll notify Salem police to increase patrol presence - in your neighborhood. - Thank you.
what makes people put all those holes in their heads and in their... Ugh!
tongue and both nipples? It's nothing new, though.
Roman Centurions used to attach their capes to their nipple piercings.
okay. That's good.
perimortem bruising around his face, his neck, and his chest.
he was forcibly drowned? - Yes.
and there's skin and blood under his fingernails. He's trying to loosen his attacker's grip.
we might have our killer's DNA. I'll process it.
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have a solvent that will dissolve the glue on Baretta's plastic claws, huh?
well, they're designed to fall off eventually, but I can try slicing the caps off with my scalpel.
No!
well, I won't hurt him.
okay.
I don't suppose anybody is gonna adopt him with pink claws.
where is it, Maura? Where's the princess cup?
I should go. W-well, let me cut the caps off first.
never mind. Pink's nice. I know Jane took Lily's cup.
where is it? - Don't be mad at Jane.
she just did it because she loves you.
what's your excuse? Well, I have a bigger purse.
and access to superior paternity testing.
Oh, yeah? Well, guess what.
I'm getting my own paternity test.
and if Lily turns out to be mine, I-I'm gonna be the dad that she deserves.
and Janie's just gonna have to accept it. That's very admirable, Frankie.
clearly, Theresa needs a good guy like you in her life.
well, I'm never getting back with Theresa. It's about Lily now.
ma? - Whoops.
Oh, I must've gotten lost.
uh, what's that behind your back? Nothing.
Oh, doctor Isles is working. I'd better come back.
Hey. Oop. - That's okay.
I can still talk while I analyze stomach contents.
what's this in the bag?
you got to be kidding me.
I'm sorry, Frankie. I have to know for your sake.
I have to talk to Jane.
just got a breakthrough in this case.
but you're welcome to stay here and finish this argument.
gee, thanks.
Yes. Put me off of Fig Newtons for life.
they're still in his stomach. Signs of mastication, but very little enzymatic or acid activity.
so... he was dead before they had time to digest.
for no longer than an hour before he was killed.
you're saying Grayson was killed before Sabrina was attacked.
Yes. And you found skin and blood under his fingernails.
DNA back? - Not yet.
our killer will have defensive wounds.
well, it wasn't Sage. She didn't have a mark on her.
frost, can you pull up a picture of Sabrina?
Sabrina had abrasions on her face.
Yeah, but I didn't see her arms. She was wearing long sleeves.
I got crime-scene photos from Salem P. D. Look at Sabrina's hands.
okay. Could those gouges be from Grayson's fingernails?
it's possible.
so Sabrina... could've killed Grayson and then staged her own attack at the Spellbox.
how? Grayson was held underwater.
Yeah, and those bookshelves weighed hundreds of pounds.
crime-lab results are back from the blood in the bowl at the altar.
all right, Helen's attempt at a healing spell...
who was she trying to heal?
Sabrina's blood was in the bowl. Anything in Sabrina's tox screen?
I mean, drugs could explain the superhuman strength.
if she was on PCP, that would explain it.
no. There's no drugs in her system.
well, something was wrong with Sabrina.
because Helen was trying to heal her.
Yeah.
Jane, I think you're right.
Sabrina's DNA results show that chromosome 8 and 13
are at 8p22-p21 and 13q.
later that same day...
many of those accused of witchcraft were suffering from mental disorders.
No! You mean they weren't really witches?
Sabrina Scott was descended from Sarah Good.
Yes, who was one of the first women put to death in Salem.
and Sarah Good was probably suffering from schizophrenia.
which can be inherited, right?
Yes. And it usually strikes in early adulthood.
it's characterized by hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior.
Oh, God. Like... like thinking you're a witch.
Sabrina does have the genetic markers for the disease.
you know, I've arrested schizophrenics in the middle of a psychotic break.
they are crazy strong and... and out of control, like being on PCP.
Hi. Yeah. This is detective Jane Rizzoli.
I need to put a security detail on Sabrina Scott, please.
W-when?
okay. Thank you.
Sabrina checked out of the hospital A. M.A.
against medical advice?
we got to find Sabrina before she gets to Sage.
all right, Korsak. Thanks a lot.
Sabrina's not at her apartment, she's not at the store, - and she's not at her father's house. - All right.
that was Salem police. They can't find Sage either.
well, Sabrina's taken out two members of her coven.
she's not gonna stop until she finds Sage. Think, guys. Where would she be?
well, what probably caused her schizophrenic break is this conflict between her adoption of witchcraft and her religious upbringing.
okay. That's a "why," not a "where."
she heard scripture during her attack at the store.
that's it.
the voices in her head are telling her to go back to her old faith.
thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
kill her. Evil shall be punished.
do it! Evil must be destroyed.
Sabrina, stop!
stop. Put the gas can down, okay?
No! Do not try to stop me.
we must die by fire.
put the torch down, all right? You don't have to do this.
all she perceives is a threat.
she's in the middle of a psychotic break. I'm not gonna let her kill Sage.
distract her. Talk to her.
death to witches.
don't think that you need to punish Sage the way that you punished Helen.
Helen was a devil worshiper!
Grayson worshiped Satan.
they were the dark ones... Witches.
she must die. - Die.
sage is evil. A devil worshiper!
she must die. - No. Sabrina...
Yes! She is! - No. You aren't evil.
die. Sabrina!
please help me. I have sinned!
it's okay.
it's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
poor Sabrina.
they took her to Bridgewater.
at least doctors there will keep her stabilized, keep her from having psychotic episodes.
it was sad. Yeah.
schizophrenia is a terrible illness. Better than being burned at the stake or drowned in your bathtub.
what the hell happened to you? Nothing.
those look like cat scratches.
Baretta got a little uptight when I took the caps off.
Oh, the sweetest cat in the world?
how many stitches, Ace Ventura?
six. - Ow.
didn't hurt.
what you eating? Humble pie?
I deserve that.
I'm sorry, okay? I'm a jerk.
Yeah, you are.
Lily's a... she's a nice girl.
and I'm gonna be a great aunt, okay? I promise.
Nope. You won't be.
got the paternity test back.
Lily's not my daughter. I'm sorry, Frankie.
Yeah. You know what? So am I.
you'll make a really good father someday.
Yeah. Someday.
that's too bad.
I was really looking forward to holidays with Theresa.
what are we gonna do about ma?
she like cats? Oh, don't even think about it.
Baretta is very sweet. Okay. It's your house.
come here. Sit down. Let me buy you a beer.
love you.
you got everything out of your cell?
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, you finally made bail. Huh, kid?
Yeah. Thought I'd never get out of this hell hole.
here, fill out and sign your inventory and property receipt, then you can change your clothes in the bathroom down the hall on the left.
Hey. Don't let me see you in here again.
you won't. All right.
your own personal sleep coach?
why does Jane need a sleep coach, and what's a "zq"?
Oh, this machine measures R. E.M...
rapid Eye Movement.
see, you just wear this while you sleep, and it calculates your sleep cycles.
she'll never get married. Send it back.
okay.
then what am I gonna get her for her birthday?
oprah says you should give to charity. That's a good idea.
Yeah, but it's not much of a gift unless you give Jane the tax deduction.
listen, I'm gonna go to the party store.
we're gonna have a surprise party.
and I am gonna celebrate even if Jane doesn't like it.
good luck with that. You know she hates surprises.
Hi. Come in.
um, I'm sorry. Uh, what are you doing down here?
Oh, I'm assisting Frankie with his anxiety.
sweetheart, why are you anxious?
is it because you put on a little weight? - What?
No! Ma... I didn't... I didn't put on any weight.
it's muscle, so...
if you say so.
can you go? - Mm-hmm.
I-I'm having my detectives exam today, and Dr. Isles is giving me some relaxation tips.
good luck, honey.
I'm gonna fail. No, you're not.
I have been reading the Mayo Clinic research on treating anxiety through hypnosis.
sit down.
okay.
now, close your eyes.
you two should at least close the blinds.
that's a very good idea. - It's not what you think.
I know. I just bumped into ma.
you better kill on that exam today, little brother.
there's nothing like a little more pressure.
come on.
there's been a stabbing at the Brimmer Street Jail.
victim probably won't survive his wounds. Let's go.
no, that's okay. I didn't want to be a detective anyway.
then why is he taking the exam?
that's sarcasm.
using irony to convey contempt?
are you trying to drive me crazy?
No!
well, what did I say?
whoa, whoa.
Boston homicide. We've been called in by the warden.
Yeah, I know. Warden Price will be here in a second.
take off your shoes and your jacket.
give me your bags.
we need to get into the infirmary and talk to the victim.
you need to go through full security, detective.
this is bullshit.
they're very thorough here.
reminds me of when I flew to Tel Aviv.
price used to be a big-time defense attorney.
before he used his juice to get this job...
Korsak and I went up against him in a few murder trials.
we beat he every time. He hates us.
she needs a pat-down. Oh, come on. She's the Chief Medical Examiner.
turn around. Spread your legs.
well, I couldn't possibly hide anything -- up there!
surrender your weapon. I know the drill.
you making this personal only wastes precious time.
this isn't personal, detective.
warden Price.
okay.
stabbing victim was just pronounced.
great... thanks for hurrying so we could talk to him before he died.
you knew him?
Yeah. His name's Graham Randall. He was only 22.
I just processed him. He made bail this morning.
poor kid.
and how long was he here? - Three weeks.
on what charge? 94C-34.
possession of class "B" cocaine. That's a misdemeanor.
he was being held here until he made the $5, 000 bail.
looks like it cost him his life. This is about three liters of blood.
well, I'm surprised he made it to the infirmary.
only because he was young and healthy.
all right.
so, no camera in here? We don't have them in the release areas.
well, you might want to re-think that. I'll need Graham's records.
once I see the appropriate subpoena.
you're really gonna make it harder for us to find this kid's killer?
because whether you like it or not, you're on our side now, counselor.
you seem a little hysterical.
did you really just say... Did he really just say that?
Jane, why don't we go take a look at the body?
it's a good thing my gun is locked up. God!
when did you start patting down police officers, Price?
it's standard for mid-level-security jails.
Yeah, in Kabul.
Korsak, will you come with me to view the body?
frost, can you start working on getting subpoenas?
price being a dick? - Yes.
he called me "hysterical."
I'm surprised his balls aren't in his throat right now.
no kidding.
he bled out.
two stab wounds to each of his kidneys.
Ouch.
it's an excruciating way to die.
Yeah, but quick. All you need is a shiv. They practically teach it in here.
any idea what the shiv was made of?
no. Looks more like puncture wounds.
the edges are surprisingly clean.
something very sharp.
like Jane.
what the hell?
do your hands hurt, Jane?
no. It's like it never happened.
well, as long as you're here, come closer.
I have so much to tell you, Jane...
and so little time.
what's he doing in a jail Infirmary? - He killed nine people, Price!
he's supposed to be in a maximum-security unit!
he's receiving treatment for cancer at Boston General's oncology unit.
you're moving him back and forth?!
even prisoners are entitled to medical care, detective.
you know he escaped before... by faking appendicitis!
you think I'm faking cancer?
do you want to see what I'm reading?
I love murder mysteries. Don't you? Oh, shut up!
I want to see his medical records. Jane is right ...
he went to medical school. He could be faking.
not without his permission.
you're gonna sign a form that lets us look at your medical records, you piece of crap.
now, Jane...
you know that's too private, even between us.
come closer. - Oh, son of a bitch.
don't you want to hear something very interesting?
something very, very bad that I did?
you wouldn't want me to die before I told you, now, would you, Jane?
don't get sucked in, Jane.
nobody knows, Jane... Nobody knows, but I'll tell you.
and the good doctor can hear, too.
but the fat cop... Get him out of here.
wait for me outside. Please.
tape this.
talk.
you have my attention for 30 seconds.
do you remember where you were in the fall of '05?
no.
the leaves were beautiful.
even the weeping willows turned yellow that year.
you said that you did something very bad.
did you murder someone in the fall of '05?
I love the feel of velvet.
virgin white velvet.
a young eagle lost its family of four.
did you know that eagles don't drink water?
I'll bet you did, Dr. Isles.
did you come through the west gate?
it is possible that the cancer has metastasized into his brain.
you don't think he knows what he's talking about?
I don't know, Maura.
I'm just saying it's possible.
I'm glad you're dying.
it's something very bad that I did, Jane.
so do one good thing with your life and if you're gonna confess to something, do it straight up so I can bring a family some peace.
I'm not looking for peace. Mnh-mnh.
and I'm bored talking with you.
are you okay?
why, because I saw my own personal boogeyman today?
no.
God -- I'm gonna have nightmares for months!
Really?
do you think you might need your own personal sleep coach?
what?
it's a good thing they didn't search us on the way out.
Maura, what are you doing?
you stole a vial of Hoyt's blood?
well... technically, sort of.
gosh, I guess it is stealing.
if he files charges, I'll be your character witness.
I don't want to get arrested! - You're not gonna get arrested.
take it to the crime lab.
I only need enough to do a staining, just to see if cancer cells are present.
great. "Scientific Inquiry." Not stealing. Let's go.
you're sure?
Yes, I'm positive.
and e-mail me the video you took with the phone, okay?
okay.
Yeah!
got Graham's Bureau of Probation records.
all of his personal belongings, too.
price can't say no to a subpoena.
and we recovered three shivs from separate cells.
nice, let's take them to Maura... See if one of them is the murder weapon.
okay, why is there a torts law book in his things?
he was in for three weeks.
how'd he plan to be a jailhouse lawyer?
well, he worked in the library. Maybe he read everything else.
did you find anything in his file?
college graduate. No priors.
he ran a red light, got caught with a couple grams of cocaine.
so who'd he piss off in jail?
Maura, did you find a shiv to match his wounds?
well...
this is a sharpened prison toothbrush.
notice the knitted handle.
Mm. There's a new take on an old favorite.
was that the murder weapon? No.
this one appears to have been made with a straightened chain-link fence.
hmm. Was that it? No.
this is a ballpoint pen embedded with a disposable razor.
was that the murder weapon? Definitely not.
okay, what's with the show-and-tell?
I just think it's so interesting, don't you?
it's a little like "Project Runway."
you know, they -- they move into the jail, they get the same items, but they all fashion different homemade shivs.
Really?
well, I think it's interesting.
you weren't even gonna tell me?
about what? About Hoyt!
I don't want ma to hear... she'll flip out.
Hi, there, you two!
Hey, ma. - Hey, ma.
someone's gonna tell her. It's all over headquarters.
we'll give her something bigger to think about so she doesn't have time to gossip. Like what?
like...
I know she's throwing me a surprise party.
no, she's not.
tell her I want a "My Pretty Pony" party.
"my Pretty Pony"?
so, you're turning 9 again?
they've been discontinued.
she'll drive all over town looking for pony party supplies.
okay.
no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! I forgot. I'm sorry.
how'd you do on the exam?
terrible. I bombed.
no, you didn't. All right? Everybody thinks they bombed.
I thought I bombed. Yeah, well, I did.
I'm gonna be on patrol for the rest of my life. No, you're not. Come on.
Hey, what's the matter with you two? You look like you lost your favorite pair of mittens.
mittens? Really? Ma.
how about a cream cheese and jelly sandwich?
that'll make you feel better.
no.
no, thanks, ma.
come on. Hey...
whoa. Don't have to take it out on her. She told me I looked fat.
I said you put on muscle weight!
no, she didn't.
you do look kind of chunky.
shut up.
Ow! Nice muscles.
do you remember where you were in the fall of '05?
he says something about eagles like right... here.
a young eagle lost its family of four.
did you know that eagles don't drink water?
why eagles? - Why are you doing that now?
Yeah, that's a good question.
I just got off the phone with Warden Price.
Sean, you know he's posturing because he's gonna run for office.
Yeah, yeah, he's an asshole. But he had a point.
Rizzoli, you're supposed to be solving an inmate's murder, not listening to some crackpot serial killer... With all due respect for what you went through.
I'm sorry. I have been working the case.
yeah? Which case?
Graham Randall's mother is here.
how about you tell me who killed that kid, Rizzoli. Hmm?
Korsak... Can you take this with Frost?
Maura just found something in the body. Sure.
I couldn't get the bail money together.
$5, 000 was just too much for me to raise.
but Graham said he was okay.
when did you last talk to him? He called me yesterday.
Graham said an angel would be coming by with his bail.
an "angel" paid your son's bail?
who? He said he was a lawyer.
he showed up at my door about an hour after Graham called with an envelope full of money.
that strike you as odd... a stranger just showing up, giving you that much cash?
I didn't care where it came from. I just knew my prayers had been answered.
I could get my son out of jail.
do you know why Graham had a law book with him?
he was going back to Boston College.
he had been accepted to the law school.
and I thought everything was finally gonna be okay.
I may have found a bowel obstruction.
hold your breath. This will smell. Come on, Maura...
I don't need to see... or smell... this.
Oh, my God.
what?
he swallowed something.
what is it? Dope?
let's see.
no. Teeth.
what the hell?
from different people.
how many different people? - Four different people.
these two are both number 8s, adult incisors, and the other two are number 29s, pre-molar bicuspids.
they're primary teeth, Jane.
you mean from children? - Yeah.
they were all removed perimortem.
before they died.
Graham Randall was a mule, smuggling out a balloon full of human teeth...
this doesn't make any sense.
I've never seen anything like this. I'll do DNA testing on each one.
okay, they could hear that on the fourth floor.
well, I turned up the audio so that I could hear Hoyt's blood results when they came in.
uh, oops. A hot-air balloon ride?
well, it's a rather unfortunate coincidence that I just found a balloon full of teeth today, but this is completely different.
I had zero interest in a balloon ride before the teeth.
well, then, what am I gonna get you for your birthday?
what is that, the duck boat ride?
no. That's Hoyt's blood results.
he has cancer.
pancreatic. Stage IV. He's definitely dying.
okay, well, that's the only birthday present I need.
teeth.
Yeah.
four of them.
Maura found them in Graham's intestines.
he swallowed them. Question is, why?
you can get anything in and out of prisons.
but who smuggles out teeth? Yeah, this is a weird one.
okay, stranger bails out our victim a few hours before he's stabbed to death.
mother said he had a law book because he was going to law school at Boston College.
B. C.'s mascot is an eagle.
so? So, that's the connection to Hoyt.
he was just playing me.
where were you in the fall of '05? Maybe that's where we should be looking.
at cold cases? You heard Cavanaugh solve this kid's murder.
Hoyt's involved.
did you find anything that put Graham anywhere near Hoyt?
maybe his library runs, but the prison doesn't keep any records.
Jane, Hoyt is dying of cancer. He didn't stab Graham Randall.
Yeah, but maybe he had somebody else do it.
he's already had two apprentices, made them kill for him.
you think Graham was Hoyt's apprentice? I don't know.
frost, stay here.
just call me if Cavanaugh comes looking for us.
who's "us"?
you and me.
where are "we" going?
to the basement, to look at cold cases.
you're going?
you know how persuasive she can be.
Korsak! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
you think this is a wild-goose chase, don't you?
Hey, I'm here, okay?
if there's something to find, we'll find it.
Thanks, Korsak.
I know what you went through.
what we went through.
nothing.
we've been through every unsolved murder from 2004 to 2006.
let's call it a night, Jane.
you go. I'm gonna stay.
there's something here! - No.
there isn't.
go home. Get some sleep.
we'll tackle Graham's murder in the morning.
good night.
you think she's still downstairs?
I'll go check.
I found it! I found it.
okay, Hoyt said, "A young eagle had lost its family."
lost.
that's why we couldn't find anything.
so I finally went to missing persons.
and found a missing family of four from the fall of '05.
Oh, my God, Jane. [family missing after taking son to college]
the Wilson family... Father, mother, two daughters.
Mm-hmm. And a son.
family dropped him off at college and were never heard from again.
this is friggin' tragic...
son was the only suspect in their disappearance.
about to start his first semester at Boston College.
Yeah, the same college where our victim, Graham Randall, was headed to this fall.
I want to go back and talk to Hoyt. Cavanaugh gave us our marching orders...
work on Graham, stay away from Hoyt. We need more.
okay.
Dr. Wilson was a Professor at the Emory School of Medicine, same medical school that Hoyt went to.
that's another connection to Hoyt.
do we even know that Hoyt was in Boston in '05?
frost, check with the B. C. Campus Police.
see if Hoyt had any connection to that college in 2005.
the thing is, it's all speculation unless we can link those teeth to the Wilsons' DNA.
Yeah, well, we find the son, we compare his DNA.
can you find a driver's license for Jacob Wilson? Yeah.
that was easy.
he still lives in Boston.
a cheek swab from Jacob will tell us whether the teeth that Graham smuggled out of jail belong to the Wilsons.
Yeah, and if they do, then both these cases got "Hoyt" written all over them.
I'm sorry. Thank you.
it's okay. I'm used to being interrogated by the police.
first time you wanted my DNA, though. Why now?
we, uh, have found some new evidence that could help us solve this case.
what evidence? We can't say.
this is your family? Yeah.
this is the last time I saw them. My new roommate took that picture.
the youngest girl is in a white velvet headband.
Hoyt said that he loved the feel of white velvet.
how fast can you check the DNA?
I'll push it right through.
I thought about lying, saying I had something to do with the disappearance, just to get you guys to look for them.
we know you didn't have anything to do with this.
you do?
we need you to tell us about the last day you saw your family.
I, uh-- was about to start college...
talk us through that day, everything you can remember.
we went to the family pancake breakfast, then a campus blood drive.
my dad was big on donating blood.
then they took me back to my dorm room.
and they said goodbye.
do the Westgate Woods near the B. C. campus mean anything to you?
Yeah. My mom and dad met there. They both went to B. C.
got something.
excuse me.
Hoyt was in Boston in '05.
B. C. Police went through their security log.
Hoyt was working as a phlebotomist for a mobile blood drive.
nice work, Frost.
does this man look familiar to you?
maybe. I don't know. Dig into your memory.
anything unusual happen at that blood drive?
the only thing that seemed weird was my dad talked to the guy who drew his blood for a while.
did he say what they talked about? The guy was one of his students.
could this be the man that your father recognized as a student that he taught in medical school?
maybe. Yeah. My dad was surprised the guy ended up in a dead-end job.
okay. Thank you, Jack.
please...
I know they're dead.
did he do it?
I just can't take not knowing anymore.
I won't stop looking for them until we find them.
okay?
okay.
Hoyt is behind the murder of Graham Randall, and the disappearance of the Wilson family. I need to talk to him.
warden Price's gonna let you go at Hoyt again. And frankly, I wouldn't either.
you're too close to this. Sean, Hoyt's given us clues we can't ignore.
but you haven't given me anything that proves he had anything to do with this family's disappearance. He could just be yanking your chain.
you think he was yanking Graham's when he gave him a balloon full of teeth to swallow?
trophies from his victims that somebody smuggled into jail for him?
you don't know who those teeth belong to, Vince.
yet. Okay, fine.
if you won't let me talk to Hoyt, then, please, just listen to our theory.
did you come through the west gate? Okay.
Westgate Park.
right near B. C. - And?
and we think that Hoyt's ego got bruised when he ran into his old Professor...
so he followed the family into the park and murdered them.
we think he dumped their bodies somewhere in that park. This park is over four acres of land.
and even with cadaver dogs, you've got to narrow the search.
what about using GPRS? Ground-penetrating radar?
you're talking about a $100, 000 fishing expedition.
and I still don't get what one case has to do with the other.
and we won't unless we go look for those bodies.
come in.
I've got the DNA results. I know you've been waiting for them.
it's the Wilsons. - Can we go fishing now?
come on. Find something damn it.
we've been out here eight hours, Rizzoli...
nothing... no sign of any human remains.
those bodies are out here. We got to keep looking.
we've combed all four acres.
crap. Press.
we're done here. - Hey, Rizzoli.
what are you digging in Westgate Park for?
we're, uh, looking up a lead in a cold case.
Aw, come on, an official at the jail told us you're not out here looking for Graham Randall's killer.
I don't have a comment on the Randall case.
Oh, so a prisoner who gets murdered in jail, Rizzoli... that's not important to you?
come on, come on, come on. Come on.
an "official at the jail." Gee, I wonder what is. Warden Price.
I'd like to hand him his nuts right about now!
eagles, westgate...
leaves, white velvet...
where are they?
if you over-secrete glucocorticoids you won't be able to think.
try to relax.
Oh, yeah, sure. I know...
why don't we take a midnight hot-air-balloon ride?
I thought it would be a unique experience, okay?
okay? But that's fine. It's all right.
you know, just save me a lot of agony, and tell me what you want.
a horse.
Really? - Yes.
a thoroughbred. And I'll name him Walter.
and he can live here in the apartment, with me, and I'll ride him every day to work.
a lot of people wouldn't put up with your abuse.
okay, don't get me anything. Pretend it's not my birthday.
I hate my birthday.
well, what is the big whoop?
I mean, why can't you just let people do something nice for you?
did you just say, "what's the big whoop"?
what's wrong with that expression? Nothing. I love it.
I'm gonna say it all the time now.
