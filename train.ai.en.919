what's the big whoop? Okay, well, what is it?
all right, fine... You want to know why I don't like my birthday?
because it never turns out the way I imagined it.
and you don't like to be disappointed.
Yeah.
help me find the Wilsons.
the leaves were beautiful.
even the weeping willows turned yellow that year.
maybe that's what we missed... The weeping willows.
no. I didn't miss anything.
and there are no weeping willows in Westgate Park.
well, many of them died from crown gall.
and I need to know this because...?
well, weeping willows grow near water...
lakes or ponds.
Hoyt said...
eagles don't drink water.
well, they get most of their hydration from their diet, but they do on occasion.
no, he said, did you go through the west gate?
that's it!
not in the park... Leaving the park!
well, who are you calling? - Korsak.
I know where the Wilsons are.
1996 baby blue Mercury wagon.
that's the Wilsons' car.
they were in this pond the whole time.
Hoyt even put 'em in their seats. Damn.
that's how they disappeared off the face of the earth.
we still have to tie Hoyt to Graham's murder.
what about the bail money?
probably still with the bail commissioner. I'll go check it out.
okay.
why would Hoyt decide to tell me now?
bastard just wants the credit for this before he dies.
Yeah, maybe.
it's my opinion, suffered a lateral incised wound...
that would have encompassed both left and right carotids and jugulars.
so their throats were slit.
Yes.
probably just eating sandwiches, enjoying a beautiful fall day, and Hoyt came across them.
my guess is he went after one of the children first, used her to keep everybody else in line.
okay.
and the warden okay'd that?
Yeah, I-I'll be right there.
Hoyt's dying, and he told the guard he wants to see me.
do you think that's a good idea?
he says he's prepared to give up the names and burial sites of every person he's murdered.
I'm going with you. - Why?
Hoyt's on a massive dose of morphine.
I might be able to help you navigate what's true and what's drug-induced fantasy.
you're not gonna believe this.
bail commissioner didn't know what to do with the envelope of bail money after Graham was killed, so he locked it up.
maybe we can lift prints.
I'll take you to the infirmary.
is Hoyt lucid? Doctor said he won't last through the night.
you got a half-hour with him, understand?
you don't tell me how long I can talk to him.
I'll talk to him till he's dead if that means solving one more of his murders.
and I hope that's not too "hysterical" for you.
just the bail commissioner's prints.
Graham's angel was too smart to leave prints on the envelope.
let's try the money.
we got 50 $100 bills here. Let's do iodine fuming.
why doesn't she ever talk to me about it?
what did he do to you, Rizzoli?
a little help down here!
what Hoyt did to her, you can't talk about.
just leave it alone, Frost. You were with her when it happened.
she's my partner, too, Korsak.
you see what it does to her.
I can't help her if she won't talk to me.
the only thing that's gonna help her is to shovel dirt on that bastard's grave.
give me the bill on the bottom.
looks like the angel touched the money.
let's hope so.
probably a thumbprint. I'll get it entered into AFIS.
he's been in and out of it.
it's not fair. Maybe he'll still be able to talk to you.
it's not fair because...
how could a person who tortured so many people get to go out so peacefully?
come closer.
I have more bad things to tell you.
I'm here.
Aah! Get him off me!
I think I'll watch.
happy Birthday, Jane.
we got a hit.
who is it? Candidate... Rod Mason,
Brimmer Street Jail. He's a guard.
that's not good, Frost. He's Hoyt's guard.
damn. Rod Mason is Hoyt's apprentice. I'm getting a recording at the jail.
they're in lockdown.
I was so hoping you were smart enough to put together my clues.
was it fun? Like a murder treasure hunt?
I should have killed you when I had the chance.
Yeah. You should have.
the taser.
I could turn it on if you like.
No!
I always finish what I start.
he played you, Mason. Just like he plays all his little apprentices.
I'm not the one wearing zip ties, detective.
what was in it for you?
well... it was fun.
kid was all proud of himself, you know.
going off to law school. Big deal.
idiot was dropping off mystery books for a serial killer.
I love mysteries.
so you were the one that set up his bail. Yeah.
all he had to do for the 5k was swallow a balloon.
it was too good to be true when little Graham told me he was off to Boston College to be a double eagle.
I knew then that he would be the perfect envelope for my letter to you.
it's time.
you killed him.
that's why the edges of the stab wounds were so clean.
that's very good, Dr. Isles.
though rod doesn't wield his scalpels with the same finesse, he did get Graham here so I could be here with you.
I'm dying, and I want company.
I think I'm gonna take you and Dr. Isles with me.
it's locked! From the inside. Bypass it from the guard station!
get on that radio... now!
hold her down.
No! - I win, Jane.
Hoyt, don't you touch her!
you're gonna feel a little pinch, doctor.
No! Stop it!
shut up!
I win.
and you're going to hell alone.
you okay, doc?
you okay?
you okay?
Yeah.
you're okay.
okay, yeah, yeah... "Surprise!"
Hello?
surprise.
surprise! Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!
God almighty!
I looked everywhere for "My Pretty Pony."
I hope this is okay.
this is fantastic, ma. Thank you. Happy Birthday.
thank you. Wow.
Dr. Finicky drinking beer out of a can?
and a lot of it after today.
although I can taste the aluminum.
well, I got my wish. Hoyt's dead.
a gift to the world. Happy Birthday, Jane.
Hey. - What?
happy Birthday.
you got a 96 on your exam?
Oh, yeah, you really bombed it.
he had a pretty good tutor. Why are you taking the credit?
I taught him everything he knows.
huh? - All right. All right.
Oh, boy. - Well...
this looks a lot smaller than Walter the thoroughbred.
I hope you like them.
they're...
driving shoes. Racing shoes.
they're fully lined with fire-resistant Dupont Nomex.
and... I need these...
because...
racing school?
you're sending me to racing school?!
well, you know, Walter's highest speed is 40 miles per hour.
and the Lamborghini Murci√©lago LP640's highest speed is 211!
well, do you like it? Yes! Yes! Thank you so much!
Oh, it's so much better than a horse!
Oh my God!
well, I had help from the guest of honor. He's a remarkable sous-chef.
didn't even know what that was till this afternoon.
Tommy, the vegetables were delicious.
ma, he sliced a celery stalk.
I cut up the broccoli, too.
okay, so, when do we get to see this fabulous apartment of yours?
soon as I have the money to get the lights turned on.
well, I told you i'd be happy to cosign.
no. - no.
no.
but if you need help moving in...
actually, I moved in today. A buddy of mine helped me.
look at him. My baby's leaving the nest again.
and this time, he's on the straight and narrow.
your baby's 32.
stop it.
you're back.
Yeah.
we really didn't get a chance to talk.
I'm gonna miss our chess games.
me too.
anyway, a token of my appreciation.
this is a 1994 chateau de gordes.
it's very rare.
yeah...
like you.
I should finish these dishes.
Yeah. Okay.
well, good night.
wait, tommy. - No, I got to go anyway.
enjoy the wine.
you've been so great to me.
everybody on the ground! Facedown! Now!
you trip the silent, I blow his head off! Get up!
if I don't see cash from that vault in 30 seconds, you die.
move it!
get up! Get up!
empty the cash in the drawers. You two, don't move!
come on!
fill it.
give me the bag. Get on the ground.
don't move. - Come on, come on!
let's get out of here.
go! Go! Go! Go!
what do we got? - Dead bank manager.
three employees witnessed the robbery and the shooting.
FBI's inside talking to them.
what are you doing out here?
the fbi has a pretty high opinion of itself and a pretty low one of local law enforcement.
they let maura and korsak in. - To process the body.
well, come on. The action's inside. - no. I'll wait out here.
it's good.
excuse me. I'm detective jane rizzoli, boston homicide.
can you direct me to the agent in charge?
you're looking at her. Special agent anna farrell.
I'm so sorry. - It's okay. I'm used to it.
a girl running the task force? Gee, it never happens to me.
I've allowed your superior and the medical examiner in while we interview the witnesses.
okay. Well, it may be your bank robbery, but it's our murder.
you can never have too many detectives. - Actually, you can.
a neighboring p. d. managed to bungle a similar investigation two weeks ago.
Yeah, I heard about cambridge.
it's always amateur hour when campus police are involved.
boston's the real deal. Okay?
so, you think it's the same crew that did the cambridge robbery.
appears to be. They made off with 30 grand in that robbery.
today's take was almost $100, 000.
Why's the window shattered? - They went out that way.
door in cambridge had a sensor.
it triggered a time-delayed transmitter hidden in the money.
what was the time delay on the dye pack?
10 seconds. We figure it went off in the getaway vehicle.
they're smarter this time...And more lethal.
witnesses say he didn't resist. Didn't try to set off an alarm.
so why'd they shoot him?
who is he? - Paul lanford, 34.
suffered what appears to be a single gunshot wound to the chest.
that's a shame. - What?
quite a bit of intra-abdominal fat. It's belly fat.
you know, it's linked to high cholesterol, high insulin levels.
I don't think he's worried about his cholesterol level, maura.
I found a witness who got the first three digits of the van's license.
I'll put out a bolo. - I already did.
detective frost, this is...
I should go check in with my team.
what was that? - Stared at her like she was a perp.
you think he stared? Casual fixation with no attention to detail?
I think he scrutinized - Close, attentive examination.
a tad hostile for our friend barry.
I think they've met before.
Boston police department.
couldn't have been on the job. Otherwise, I would have met her, too.
maybe it was when he was in uniform.
it seemed personal. Did you get the sense that they'd slept together?
I'm not very good at figuring out who's sleeping with whom.
stick with what you're good at. What does his body tell you?
the track of the projectile is through the right lung, into the heart...
and through the left lung.
and there it is at the fifth intercostal.
it's a 40 caliber.
the bank robber shot him at point-blank range.
he was cooperating. Why would he do that?
perhaps your suspect has a smaller amygdala and prefrontal cortex.
it results in poor impulse control.
not everyone with a small brain shoots people.
you sound like my mom making excuses for tommy.
his dyslexia made him do it.
have you heard from him? - Who...tommy? no.
just wondering if he got turned on.
the lights.
got his lights turned on.
B. p.d. Unit found the getaway van.
Oh, that's great! - No, it's not.
the fbi is sitting on it. - Why are they running surveillance?
this is bullshit. I want that thing processed. Let's go out there.
feds. Always make it that much harder for us to do our jobs.
she dumped your ass, didn't she?
when and where?
about three years ago at the corner of "none of your business" and "don't ask.
agent farrell. - Detective rizzoli.
detective frost.
we're running a surveillance operation. Why are you here?
you really think they're coming back to ride around in a van they used in a bank robbery?
the plates on the van were stolen from a mall last night.
we've been sitting on it for an hour. - It's been dumped.
and we need to get our people from the crime lab in that van.
no. We're sitting tight.
great. Well, you sit tight and watch that empty van while our killers are out there robbing banks and shooting people.
okay, what happened between you two?
he, wouldn't put the toilet seat down.
okay.
can I take a look? - Sure.
thank you.
wait! What are you doing!?
police!
95. 6.
liver temp indicates he's been dead about two hours.
CSRU says the van's been wiped down pretty clean.
no prints on the wheel or doors.
okay. Let's get latent prints out here, see what they can find.
perhaps this will help.
a hair.
do you see a root ball? - yes.
I'll have it run through codis.
blood spatter indicates he was shot inside this van.
this is strange-looking blood.
do you see why I will only commit to a reddish-brown stain?
this is not blood.
well, what is it, then, dr. Smarty pants?
paint. Yeah.
see? I see flecks of avocado green, tiffany blue enough, picasso. Okay. So, this van was used for commercial painting at some point.
agent farrell, look.
you see the red spray on the roof?
they tried to wipe it off.
Yeah. That's from the dye pack.
must be from the cambridge robbery.
I'm gonna run this vin number.
well, if we're lucky, it'll be registered to the dead guy.
do you recognize him?
he was on our list of suspects.
John polk, 31.
convicted of bank robbery -Released last spring after serving 10 years.
that's ricky dunn, his partner in that robbery -Also recently paroled.
I'm thinking they reunited.
frost, bring up the bank surveillance footage.
how tall was john polk?
6'2."
and what about ricky dunn?
5'7." - Got it.
freeze it.
well, that looks about right, don't you think?
John polk, our 6'2" dead guy, is the shooter.
Ricky dunn is his 5'7" accomplice.
what do you know about dunn?
we checked with his parole officer. He hasn't reported in for the last two weeks.
so, when you told us he was on your list,he was really your prime suspect.
do we need to speak privately, detective frost?
no, I'm good.
well, that's quite a history.
Ricky dunn is prone to violence.
history of drug use, gambling. - But not john polk.
he came from a middle-class home. No drug use, no violence.
till he robbed a bank with dunn.
but this time, polk kills the bank manager. Why?
got nervous. Accidently pulled the trigger.
Yeah, maybe.
frost, can you slow it down?
so, polk turns to go, but then he turns back.
it's like he's making a decision. - Yeah.
to kill him.
frost, try a search with both names -John polk and paul lanford.
you think they knew each other?
if they did, this is an inside job.
Yeah. Look.
robber and bank manager played on the same all-star hockey team.
maybe paul lanford got the job at the bank to set the whole thing up.
detective frost, can you check lanford's - credit report?
I'm already doing it.
you think polk double-crossed lanford? - Maybe.
he was already splitting the money with his partner, dunn, plus the getaway driver.
okay.
so, Maxed out on his cards.
behind on all his payments.
serious debt. Lanford need to rob his own bank.
this will be awkward, then. Paul lanford's widow is in the conference room.
be right there. - I'm joing.
frost, you coming? - I'll sit this one out.
Mrs. Lanford?
we're sorry for your loss.
if it's all right with you, we'd like to ask you some questions about your husband.
okay.
can you tell us how long paul worked at the bank?
just a few months.
he'd been unemployed for a year. Things were finally looking up.
do you know this man? John polk.
no. why?
your husband did.
they played hockey together.
I'm confused. This was years ago.
but both were in the bank when it was robbed this morning, and now both are dead.
my husband was at his job. What are you saying?
we have reason to believe that he may have been involved in the robbery.
he was killed by the robbers.
we've looked into your financial records. - Paul would never do anything illegal.
you were having some serious troubles.
please understand that we just need to explore all the possibilities.
I understand.
but I don't understand her.
let's get these out of here.
tactful warmth isn't my strong suit. You're amazing.
Oh. Well, I've just been at it a long time.
a lots of families, a lot of grief.
I don't think paul lanford had anything to do with it. You?
I'm not sure.
I hope I didn't screw that up.
it's okay. You'll get there. It's okay. You'll get there.
you okay? That doesn't look good.
just something I have to handle right away.
all right. Well, let me know if something develops in the case.
sure thing.
John polk's parents are on a cruise. Found a brother - david.
we're gonna have to do a notification.
okay. I'll go with you.
I like her.
so did frost - a lot.
look what I found.
they were engaged?
no wonder he's so grumpy. - Man with a lot of secrets.
come on. Let's go tell john polk's brother the bad news.
the wheels on the bus go 'round and 'round 'round and 'round,'round and 'round hang on, kids.
can I help you?
Yeah. Hi. We're looking for a david polk.
that's me.
could we speak to you in private, please?
I'll watch phoebe.- Phoebe, honey, I want you to go with miss sophie.
play with timmy so daddy can talk, okay?
I'm sergeant korsak. This is detective rizzoli.
are you able to reach your parents?
no. They're traveling. What's the matter?
it's about your brother, john.
What'd he do this time?
he's a suspect in a bank robbery that occurred this morning.
he just got out of prison.
if you're looking for him, I don't know where he is.
we're sorry to tell you...Your brother john was shot and killed.
what?
Oh, my god.
who shot him?
we think it was connected to the bank robbery.
do you know this man -Paul lanford?
Yeah.
I helped coach the hockey team my brother and paul played on.
I couldn't play 'cause my achilles tendon snapped.
paul was a manager at the bank. - "was"?
he was killed during the robbery.
did my brother do that?
do you know this man?
Yeah. Ricky dunn.
I warned my brother to stay away from ricky.
10 years of hard time they did.
I told john, "stay away from all your ex-con buddies."
do you know any of the names of those ex-cons?
we believe there was a third person involved in the robbery.
no.
my brother and I lived in two totally different worlds.
daddy.
I'm sorry. My daughter needs me.
I'll try to find my parents.
thank you.
red particulate.
residue from the exploded dye pack.
it's still moist, which is curious since the first bank robbery was two weeks ago.
Dr. Isles, I'd like you to take a look at the latent-print findings.
on the van? You got a hit?
three, actually. You should have the report.
John polk's prints were on the gas cap.
Ricky dunn's were on the interior ceiling.
we found a third partial print on the rear-view mirror.
presumably the van's driver? - yes.
it's not here.
I have the only hard copy.
this can't be right. It's tommy.
this matter is under investigation by a federal grand jury.
by virtue of title 18, rule 6e, neither you nor any member of your team is to disseminate any information about said individual as it relates to this case under penalty of prosecution.
there has to be some other explanation.
none of this is to be shared with anyone in boston p. d.
that includes the suspect's sister, detective jane rizzoli.
sign here.
prison tats.
we notified his brother at a "mommy and me" class.
can't believe they're from the same family.
birth order is a significant factor.
the oldest child is typically highly motivated, like you, - while the youngest - Robs banks?
I was gonna say, they tend to be coddled.
pick interests diametrically opposite to their older siblings.
tend to be... Risk-takers.
I see you've read the rizzoli family study.
have you heard from tommy yet?
no. And that's the second time you've asked me.
look who's coddling.
are you okay? You're acting weird.
stomachache.
you don't have stomachaches.
you have gastro-stomach-opolitis aches.
from what? - Gastralgia...From stress.
so stop staring at whatever's under that microscope.
it's the hair I found in john polk's coveralls.
we got a dna match in codis. It belongs to ricky dunn.
well, that's no surprise.
we know that john polk and ricky dunn liked robbing banks together.
the crime lab also found a trace compound on it.
zinc stearate.
which is?
it's a chief ingredient in fanning powder.
fanning powder?
they use that on decks of cards.
to decrease friction, yes.
Yeah, the fbi profile on dunn said he was prone to gambling.
and he's got his share of 100, 000 bucks to launder.
hang on a second.
frost. I want to know about every underground gambling operation in boston..
dice, cards, whatever.
okay. Thanks.
I got to go.
how bad is this stomachache?
bad.
I'm gonna finish up here and go home.
all right. I'll call you later.
sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
what are you doing here? - Look, maura...
sometimes I do stupid, crazy things.
I feel -I feel terrible. I'm really sorry.
Tommy, you are in serious trouble.
what, did you tell jane? Does she know?
I can't discuss this with you.
FBI! Get your hands up!
get your hands up!
stop! You're hurting him!
get off me! I didn't do anything. - Let him go!
let's go. - Get off me! I didn't do anything!
wait! Tommy! - didn't do anything!
let's hit him quick. Dunn's got a history of violence.
get those hands up!
it's dunn! I got him. I got him! I got him!
let me see your hands.
I'm not going back to prison. - Drop your weapon, dunn.
is that ricky dunn? - yeah. He's dead.
that's two. Just leaves the getaway driver.
we just took him into custody.
his prints were discovered in the van by the latent team.
Really? Who is he?
another ex-con.
does jane know?
damn it! You didn't tell her?!
second-degree mid-dermal burns from the exploding dye pack.
Yeah, that's what you do - You hide behind science.
you knew the fbi was about to arrest tommy.
check your messages. I called you the second that I could.
you should have called me before he was arrested.
look, title 18 forbids me from... - I don't give a damn about title 18!
there are ways to tell me without telling me.
Really? Well, the justice department could have indicted me for the mere act of disclosing my knowledge of their intent to arrest tommy.
that is 10 years in a federal prison, plus the loss of my medical license.
you didn't trust me enough to protect you.
and you didn't protect me. - Jane...
and what is this? Farrell tells me that you were with him when he was arrested.
I can't wait to hear the explanation for that.
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I forgot. You can't talk to me.
he found me in the parking lot. He wanted to apologize.
Oh, yeah?
Hi, maura. i'm sorry I was the getaway driver in a bank robbery.
sorry somebody got gunned down.
I think he wanted to apologize for trying to kiss me.
what, did tommy make you sign a title 18, too?
we were embarrassed, okay?
I thought it'd be better if we just forgot about it.
Jane, farrell got to cavanaugh.
I'm sorry. He made me and korsak the lead on the two homicides.
okay.
you see that, maura?
that's what friends do. They tell you.
excuse me. I have to go check on something.
I'm off the case, frost. My brother is a suspect.
this is all farrell. You know what? She doesn't even
what the hell went down between you two?
she married the job instead of me.
this is her fault.
she's just doing her job.
so was maura.
what, did farrell make you sign a title 18, too?
no. She made Dr. Isles, didn't she?
I'm going to talk to david polk.
Jane, you can't. - I'm not going as a cop.
I'm going as tommy's sister.
thanks for seeing me, mr. Polk. - no. Please, call me david.
sorry about the mess. Phoebe's with her mom today.
we're... Separated.
I'm a really bad housekeeper. - It's fine.
please don't worry about it.
I was just wondering if you would look at a picture and tell me if you recognize this person.
Yeah.
that's one of john's ex-con buddies.
he's my brother.
was he part of the robbery crew? - It's looking that way.
the fbi thinks that he was possibly the getaway driver.
I'm sorry.
does it help that I know exactly how you feel?
I just never thought i'd be on this side of this, you know.
if it's any consolation, at least you can still ask your brother why.
I need to talk to you.
give us a minute.
I told you you couldn't see him.
let me talk to him, please.
all I can give you is two minutes.
Thanks.
Jane. Thank god.
Why?
how could you be a part of this?
that bank manager is dead.
John polk is dead, too. God, tommy...
Jane, are you crying? Don't cry.
I'm not crying. - I didn't do this!
your fingerprints are all over the rear-view mirror...
in the getaway van.
John let me use his van to move.
John was my friend. That's why my prints were there.
then what about ricky dunn?
he's john polk's partner.
they used to rob banks together. Did you know him, too?
not all of us ex-cons know each other.
tell me where you were yesterday morning.
I was in my new place, sleeping.
it's a crap alibi, but it's the truth.
and why did you borrow a van from a convicted bank robber?
John served his time.
he was starting a house-painting business.
he was working his ass off to turn his life around.
he asked me to work a job with him -A house-painting job.
janie, I told them all this. They don't believe me.
but I thought you would.
time's up.
all right, all right!
Tommy, look at me.
did you do this?
no.
then I won't let you go back to prison. I promise.
he said john polk was painting a house during the time of the robbery.
we found paint in polk's van.
if john polk was still alive, i'd be charging him with bank robbery and felony murder, just like your brother.
what if he's telling the truth?
that's for a jury to decide.
I'm sorry.
too bad you can't live in your microscopic world.
makes more sense than the macro world right now.
Yeah.
my brother's facing a life sentence.
the faint red that you noted in the van is disperse red 9 aerosol.
it was the dye pack.
so, the same paint you found under polk's nails.
uh, no. That is an oil-based paint.
a house paint? - yes.
I found the same paint particulates in his nostrils.
the moisture levels indicate that he'd been painting within the last 24 hours.
so tommy was telling the truth.
John was painting yesterday morning.
if he was doing that, he couldn't possibly be robbing a bank.
unlike electrons, human beings can't be in two places at once.
physical laws of quantum mechanics.
I kind of love that you know that. - You do?
so, you don't hate me?
no. I still hate you. - Okay. I'll work on hating you, too.
wait a minute. The only one that we know for sure who robbed that bank was ricky dunn.
what if tommy and john had nothing to do with it?
my stomachache would go away. - Yeah, me too.
can you isolate the manufacturer of that red paint and find out where it was being used?
if we prove that john was painting, then at least a piece of tommy's story is true.
there are 285 shades of red.
multiply 285 by the names that paint companies assign to the shades really.
Yes. - Good.
and I'll do my gumshoe thing.
there's only like, you know, 3, 000 streets in boston.
I kind of love that you can do that.
Well...Then I hate you a little bit less.
I think we still have two bank robbers out there. I got to go.
Jane...Do you know how long you're going to hate me for?
it's too soon to tell.
they got tommy's fingerprints. - And he's a convicted felon.
Tommy's fingerprint are in the van because he was moving his stuff.
and he called john because he needed to borrow that van.
20 calls? - They're friends.
Plus, john was trying to find tommy some work.
don't put on mom's rose-colored glasses, jane. Please.
just hear me out, all right?
what if ricky dunn borrowed john's van, too?
but not to move - To rob a bank.
okay. We know the robbery went bad. Paul lanford gets killed.
Yeah, and paul was john's old friend from hockey.
you know, john hears about the robbery, hears about paul's murder.
maybe he confronts ricky.
Ricky panics, kills john, frames him.
leaves the body with the mask in the getaway vehicle.
how does any of this prove that tommy didn't do it?
it doesn't.
it's colonial red.
Yes. It's very expensive.
used primarily on doors and trim in historic home renovations.
okay. There are only three neighborhoods with colonial houses still standing.
what do you need us to do?
okay.
patrol's got no houses getting painted red in the north end.
nothing in haymarket either.
keep units going up and down every block of boston.
okay. Hang on a second. I'm gonna put you on speaker.
it's frankie. He says he's got something.
okay. Go ahead. - We found the house.
it's in dorchester. - Give me the address.
1772 mayfair drive.
got a foreman who will testify that john polk was here painting during the time of the robbery.
thank you, frankie.
you were right. John didn't do it.
Yeah, but now we got to prove tommy didn't either.
but first we got to find two bank robbers who are still out there.
can you play the bank-robbery tape again?
it gets me every time -He shoots an innocent man, but he walks away like he's got all the time in the world.
I still say it looks like they knew each other.
it doesn't make any sense now that we know that that's not john polk.
can you rewind it and slow it down?
Why? What are you seeing?
a physical reason for his deliberate pace. There.
I don't see anything.
wait. That's it.
watch lanford's eyes. He looks down...
at polk's ankle.
achilles tendon, actually. It ruptured and atrophied when it healed.
that's what causes his slight limp. You see it?
Yeah.
Lanford saw it, too. Polk must have felt lanford watching him and realized that lanford recognized him from his limp.
John polk and david polk were the same size, same build.
it's david polk, the good brother.
the one who stopped playing hockey when his achilles tendon snapped.
Thanks.
david polk dropped phoebe off 20 minutes ago and took off.
she said he did the same thing two days ago.- The day of the bank robbery.
and I think I know who the driver is.
Carl parker. - The other dad we saw?
apparently, he left with polk - both times.
pull up david polk and carl parker's credit reports.
david polk declared bankruptcy last year. He's divorced.
Oh, man. Both polk and carl parker lost their houses.
first bank they hit foreclosed on carl parker's house.
and the second one turned down polk for a small business loan.
look at the bank that took polk's home.
Copley square bank.
call farrell. Get fbi over there.
emergency dispatch to copley square bank. - Oh, crap. It's already on.
come on.
he shot a hostage? - he demanded a helicopter. He didn't get it.
how many hostages? - Half a dozen.
there's a second suspect.
sniper hit him? - yes.
were we right? Is it carl parker?
matches his description. The one who shot the hostage is probably david polk.
damn it.
all right. Let me talk to them. - No.
that hostage is bleeding out.
unless you've got a helicopter getting them, I'm going in.
Jane, don't even think about it. - Forget it.
we need a go on that shot.
this is special agent anna farrell. Take the shot.
you don't have a shot. He's got a human shield. - Jane, don't!
what the hell is she doing?! - Tell your snipers to stand down!
stand down, stand down.
stand down. All teams, hold fire.
I'm unarmed. It's all right.
okay. My name is detective jane rizzoli.
I- I am unarmed. I just want to talk.
stay back!
okay, okay.
this woman needs medical treatment. All right?
please. You can take me instead of her, okay?
please don't let her die. - Stay back.
...don't let her die.
bringing the hostage out now.
it's okay.
I know why you're doing this, okay?
you lost your jobs. You lost your homes, your pride.
my wife left me.
I was just a name on a spreadsheet to this bank.
so you looked up your brother's - 'cause you knew john wouldn't help you. - Shut up!
and you borrowed his van.
but john discovered what you did, so you shot him.
I didn't kill him.
he was my brother.
and he wouldn't have talked.
so it was carl. - He was gonna turn us in.
this was your idea. You're the one who got me into this.
I think you got yourself into this. - Yeah, well, we're gonna get out.
the only that is protecting you two right now is me.
I'm standing between you and a sniper's bullet.
I'm your only chance.
come on. You guys still got something to live for.
no, I don't. Not anymore.
Yes, you do. Think of phoebe.
all right? And timmy.
come on, come on.
they...they don't want to see you die.
it doesn't matter what you've done.
come on, give me the gun. Come on.
come on, david. Give me the gun.
come on.
come on.
No!
get on the floor!
stay put. Don't move.
I swear to god, tommy. If you were involved in this, I was gonna kill you myself.
Oh, yeah. That's all we need -Another rizzoli charged with murder.
thank you so much, janie. - You're welcome.
next time you need help moving, just call me, okay?
all charges have been dropped.
I spoke with your parole officer. He's waiving your violations.
thank you. - Thank you.
come on. We'll drive you home.
ma, stop.
you gonna put the job ahead of her?
she did.
I heard that you wouldn't put the toilet seat down.
she told you that? - Yeah.
she said that was the only thing she didn't like about you.
I'm having grilled cheese.
it goes with anything. It's a 1994 chateau de gordes.
again? I'm so sick of that.
it's sheer perfection. I've only had it once.
listen, I don't want to stand in the way of a great romance, okay?
what do you mean? - You and tommy.
I mean, clearly, opposites attract.
it's an evolutionary strategy to ensure healthy reproduction.
okay. Why do you got to go straight to breeding?
all right? With my brother?
look,
I like tommy. A lot.
but I love you.
and I hate it when you hate me.
so I don't want to do anything to compromise our friendship.
good, 'cause I hate it when I have to hate you.
sip it slowly.
how Much was this? - $625.
did you just spit out a '94...
de blah-blah? yes.
my god, some smart shopper tommy is.
he wasted a month's rent on a bottle of rancid vinegar and old garlic.
no, no. It just needs to breathe and release its tannins.
Really?
Yeah.
you might be right.
what are you doing? - I'm gonna pour it back in the bottle - so tommy can take it back. - They're not gonna take it back.
they'll take it back.
et voil.
what? Don't make a face. It's cute.
Yeah, if you're playing mahjong.
so, why'd you buy it? - 'cause it was half off.
donations pile.
no, I want to look sexy but not like I'm trying too hard.
you know, fun but not slutty.
you want Casey guessing what kind of lacy balconette bra you have on.
donations?
No! No, no, no! Maura, no, I was gonna wear that.
okay. Well, let's hope he likes the athletic look.
did you shave your legs? - Yes. Pits too.
I just - I hate that I have to go to my high-school reunion to get Casey back here.
you know, there are three reasons that people avoid their high-school reunions.
Yeah, one - They hated high school.
two - they hated everybody in high school.
what's the third one?
embarrassment over getting fat.
then there's fear of running into your ex or you're an abject failure.
why are you avoiding? - Abject failure.
I have no husband, no kids, no south end brownstone.
that was, you know, the thing when I was in high school.
I can see your point.
okay, if I wanted support like that, I would have called my mother.
sorry.
what time's Casey's plane landing?
should be getting in now.
aren't you a little worried he's gonna be too jet-lagged?
well, unless he arrives dead, I think he'll be up for some sex, no?
this is him.
what? - He's telling me to open up a chat room.
you know what? He better not be standing me up.
you don't look like you're at logan.
I'm not. My squad was sent on a mission. I've just got back to base.
obviously, I'm not gonna make the reunion.
that's okay. It's - it's no big deal.
Yes, it is. Tell him you miss him.
who's that?
she said, you know, it's a shame you're gonna miss it.
Jane, I-I really wanted to see you.
I, they wouldn't even let us contact anyone.
I'm so sorry.
don't apologize.
making the world safe for democracy.
thanks for understanding.
I, I got to go. Okay? I'll call you soon.
okay. Bye.
Bye.
crap.
I'm sorry.
you know what? - Come on.
I am going to be your designated driver so you can go drink with your high-school nemes.
it's " - sis." Isn't it "nemesis"?
"Ses" when it's plural. I'm sure you have several formidable enemies.
Oh, and how are you so "sure"?
okay, yes, fine. There was one group of mean girls
Debbie and Emily and Kate.
great! So, let's go show Debbie, Emily, and Kate how fabulous you turned out to be.
I knew it. You just want to tag along so you can go all Jane Goodall on me at my high-school reunion because you got imprisoned in an all-girls'
I was hardly "imprisoned." But, yes, I will admit that the co-ed experience interests me.
no. No. It's not gonna happen.
I'm not going. And if I'm not going, you're not going.
94th HIGH-SCHOOL REUNION
okay, see? Co-ed high school.
you happy now? Let's go.
Oh, another reason I didn't want you to come.
hello.
you two are still.
together? Yes. Yes, we are still together.
get off me.
shouldn't you run along?
isn't there some "barf of the week club" member you should be talking to?
"barf of the week"?
won it five times. It's nice you two are still together.
the longest relationship I ever had was 34 days
well, 35 if you count break-up sex.
we'll count that.
Hi,G.
hot, right?
Hi. You know, you look just like Maria Korkman.
but kind of like a hot, skinny version.
Giovanni... Oh, you remember her. Man, she was fat, all right?
Hey, Maria. - Hey, Jane.
I've been working out.
no way. You know, you look so smokin' hot, we're gonna need a garden hose to cool you down.
God...
reason number four that people hate high-school reunions
mean girl Debbie Nichols.
relational aggression typical of adolescent females.
but she's long past that.
Oh, my god. Jane Rizzoli.
Oh, it's probably not "Rizzoli" now. It's Mrs...
Mrs... Detective Jane Rizzoli.
there's no "Mrs." you?
I'm Mrs. Eddie Tibbet.
you married Dddie Tibbet? - Yeah.
Hey, Jane. - Hey, Eddie.
look at you, in a suit!
can you believe it? Me and Eddie?
you mean because you were part of the "mean girls" clique?
Eddie, and, now, what clique were you a part of?
the computer-geek clique.
Oh, me too. I'm a science geek.
I'm a geek now, too.
home and garden columnist for the boston dispatch and a plant activist.
guess someone has to give a voice to plants.
she dumpster-dives behind nurseries.
okay, well, you know, we...
...we should probably get moving.
don't want to keep the name-tag line held up.
nice to meet you. Bye. - Okay. Bye.
I've always wanted to go to a high-school reunion with a punch bowl.
there's a jello mold over here. Try not to hyperventilate.
come on. Come on. Let's go.
come on, come on. - I'm getting punch.
okay, look. Purple dress. Big boobs.
is that your bete noire?
if that means former BFF, yes. That would be Emily.
what? Is that the one that dumped you in the 8th grade?
well, who would need me when you could get any guy on the planet with those things?
even Steve Sanner. He was so nice. That's too bad.
a boyfriend? - I wish.
no - one date to see "dumb & dumber" doesn't constitute as a boyfriend.
come one. Come on. Let's go.
steve and Emily.
it's been too long.
I hear it's detective Rizzoli these days.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it is.
this is my friend, Dr. Maura Isles.
I know, right? Real waste, bro.
keep walking, Giovanni.
we're just friends.
not friends-friends. Just close friends.
well, not - not that close.
Dr. Isles tagged along because she missed out on the whole co-ed high-school experience, so...
well, we have to go man the hospitality table, but it's really good to see you.
you too. - Okay.
I'll be there in a sec. - Okay.
I was,
excuse me.
I was hoping I'd run into you.
I need to talk to you about something. Is it okay if I call you?
Yeah. Is - Is everything okay?
well, look who found - Roly-poly Rizzoli.
I almost didn't recognize you. I hear you're a security guard or something.
she's a detective.
don't bother. This - This is Rory Graham.
and now my night is complete.
if I had a nickel for every time a girl said that to me.
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm gonna go help Emily.
Stevie works for me.
I'm sure you've read about how I transformed graham biomedical into an industry leader.
no, I only read the big stories.
big print, I think you mean.
wait - you manufacture the melee heart valve.
that valve has transformed the lives of children with heart defects and people with cardiovascular disease.
the advanced bileaflet mechanical design we came up with is pretty brilliant.
you came to one of our reunions. I heard you might. - Kate.
this isn't stoli. Where's the lime, babe?
was she a mean girl, too? - Queen of mean.
look at that body.
you definitely didn't have any kids, did you?
well, I... Rescued a dog once. Does that count?
Rory and I have three, actually. Two boys and a little girl.
Yeah, Kate was a high-priced corporate lawyer.
but I was doing so well, I said,"babe...
I need a wife not a lawyer.
needs more lime, babe.
do you miss your work?
you know, every now and then I do, but I
babe - Babe, I see some of the guys from the team.
football. Rory led them to a state championship.
twice. Later, Rizzoli. Doc.
Rory Graham just dissed me. Again.
I'm done. Let's go. - Okay.
bring my punch. I just want to bring my punch.
okay.
I knew I shouldn't have gone.
how did that improve the quality of my life?
I wonder what happened to Clarissa Wyndham.
there she is.
she married the Duke of Shernandorne.
what is it with the English and their ridiculous hats?
the anglican church made women cover their heads.
W - with a pink migrating goose?
that's awful.
Yeah.
Oh, my god.
you don't have to do this.
Oh, my god.
it really is Steve Sanner.
somebody shot him. Somebody shot Steve. - I know. I know. I know.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Can you take her?
Yeah, of course. She's like family. Okay.
come on. Let's go get the kids and bring them back to our house, okay?
this is not the place for you, okay?
and I will be by the house as soon as I can.
okay. Okay.
go. Go on.
sorry. I... I knew him. I just spoke to him a few hours ago.
damn. I'm sorry.
Jane, we got this.
how'd he die?
gunshot wound to the chest.
appears to be a medium-caliber entry wound.
wallet's still here. So we're thinking it wasn't a robbery.
Yeah, shooting someone at their high-school reunion doesn't seem real random.
cellphone's here. I'll check the records.
lack of soot deposit and tattooing around the entrance wound.
so it doesn't look like a close range? - I'm not sure.
he has a large amount of metallic fiber on his clothing. - Yeah.
looks like steel wool.
can you take that?
frost, can I have an evidence bag. - Yeah.
found a piece of plastic. Look around. You see any more?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Right here.
could have been a water bottle with some steel wool shoved into it.
you thinking homemade silencer? - Yeah.
this is deliberate. Took some planning.
there's some orange dirt here.
some over there. Could be clay.
the track is artificial turf.
baseball diamond is that way. Maybe the killer walked across it.
I'll have Repier check for footwear impressions and get some clay sample for a comparison. - Okay.
he said he wanted to talk to me.
maybe this is why.
and Steve wasn't having any issues with anyone at work?
disagreements with co-workers? People he managed?
no. Nothing. Business was smooth.
steve was Mr. Nice guy, just like in high school.
we do need to talk to Emily.
she's upstairs with the children.
they're asleep.
I'll tell you anything you need to know.
do you want me to stay? - It'd be better if we spoke to Emily alone.
all right, well...
we'll be in the kitchen if you need us, okay?
I'm so, so sorry for your loss.
thank you.
was Steve having problems with anyone?
anyone that he might have run into at the reunion?
no.
he was so excited about the reunion.
steve loved high school. We all did, right?
right.
what about at work?
you won't understand, but... Jane knows.
everybody loved Steve.
everybody.
how was your marriage?
were you and Steve having any problems?
we were happy.
we were the couple that everyone wanted to be.
I mean...
...it was a perfect life.
how am I gonna go on without him?
there.
my -What are you doing in my apartment?
you left the web chat on.
thought I'd say hello, find out how the reunion was.
Oh, Casey. It - it was awful.
steve Sanner was murdered last night.
what the hell?
I left early, and - and he was shot on the football field a few hours later.
that's crazy.
wasn't he married to that cheerleader?
Emily someone - The one with the,
the one with the, High a. p. Scores?
no. No. That's not it. Let's see. - Okay.
the one with the soccer scholarship?
no, that's not it, either.
okay, you know what I was gonna say. Wasn't she a friend of yours?
Yeah, she was until she became "the one with the big boobs."
was Rory Graham there?
he and Steve had a business together.
Yes, Rory was there.
he and his head barely fit in the gym.
well, maybe they had a falling-out.
I don't think so, but, you know, we're looking into it.
which, speaking of, I have to go to work.
like that? - No, I was gonna take both towels off.
it's "naked day" at BPD.
I've been thinking about you... A lot.
when you think about me, am I wearing a towel on my head?
hanging up now.
too sweet?
does it have white sugar?
would you prefer brown?
well, I only do stevia. It's an herb. All-natural.
I'll get you a fresh glass.
they actually had a jello mold.
have you ever seen that? - Incoming.
wish me luck.
I'm back. Surprise! - Surprise.
you're h - wow. You're...
you're here.
I'm here.
melody is my ex-wife. - Yeah, we - we've met.
Dr. Maura Isles. Nice to meet you.
likewise. I'm not just any old ex.
I'm the last and the best.
the other two were just warm-ups, right Vince?
Yeah. Well, then, it's very nice to meet you.
can I talk to you?
I would love that.
Hey! - Hi.
melody. - Hi!
how are you?
you look wonderful. - So do you.
we can talk over here.
okay. Later. - Right.
what are you doing here?
what do you suppose is going on?
well, I don't know, ma. Why don't you go follow them?
why do you have to be so snippy? - Why do you have to be so snoopy?
I have not seen that woman in five years.
why is she back? - No idea.
you know, Korsak raised her son for almost 10 years.
Oh, my god. He never mentions him.
broke his heart when they divorced.
she moved away and took the son with her.
all right. Did you start the autopsy on Steve Sanner?
just about to. - Okay.
well, call me if you get anything. - Of course.
checked criminal records for everyone who attended your reunion.
everybody's pretty clean.
how many of them have alibis? - About half.
so we have 75 suspects. Swell.
how's Melody? I was surprised to see her.
Oh, me too. Don't ask. I won't tell.
who's Melody? - The ex-wife who got away.
okay. Got something.
God.
nice eyebrows.
don't you mean "eyebrow"?
a Senior Quote. That's sweet.
no, don't read. Don't. It's dumb.
be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.
what? I like Dr. Seuss.
look what I found. Korsak the Thespian.
what, were you the referee for the "sonny & cher" show?
that play was cutting-edge for its time. It got great reviews!
okay. E-excuse me. Steve Sanner was a friend of mine.
can we get back on track here, please? - Sorry.
thank you.
steve Sanner and Rory Graham the day Graham biomedical announced production of the artifical valve.
nothing I could find on either. - Steve and Rory were like brothers.
in fact, Steve was the only person Rory was ever nice to.
one time, Steve threw a football through a stained-glass window.
and Rory took the blame for it just so Steve could go on a date.
must have been quite a girl. - I don't know about that.
it was me.
like I said...
what do you think these numbers mean?
they're in the "notes" section of Steve's phone. - Bank accounts maybe?
maybe. They're too long to be IP Addresses.
russian phone-sex lines? - Yeah, that was my first thought.
insight from a case I worked.
the case of the lonely detective.
steve made a few calls to a local preschool.
his kids are 10 and 12. Why would he be calling a preschool?
and six calls to a Debbie Tibbet.
Yeah, I saw them talking at the reunion.
damn. She's married to Edward Tibbet.
guy owns a company that designs software. He's worth about $50 million.
FINANCHAL NEWS Software CEO Tibbet Reaches $50 Million in Salary, Stocks
damn. I knew I should have been nicer to him.
just kidding. Good for him.
he was always a sweetheart. Great.
just found a few more calls between debbie and steve.
any chance they might have been having an affair?
I don't know. Let's go ask Debbie.
Hello?
what are you doing here?
we just wanted to ask you some questions.
okay. Would you mind holding these alba roses?
so awful about Steve Sanner.
Yeah. Could you, tell us about your relationship with him?
what do you mean?
come on, Debbie. You know what I mean. We have his phone records.
we... Ran into each other.
we had coffee, a few conversations.
were you having an affair? - No.
of course not.
Boston police!
now!
Boston P.D.„ÄÇGet out of the car.
damn it! Do you know how much this is gonna cost?
keep your hands where we can see them.
take it easy. I'm a private investigator.
then you know the drill. Two fingers - pull some I.D.
slowly.
I got every right to be here.
you want to lose the attitude?
we're in the middle of a homicide investigation.
you're interfering with a potential witness.
I got nothing to do with a homicide.
then why the paparazzi camera?
it's okay. He's a... Plant activist, as well. - Okay. Great.
husband thought she might be banging someone. Hired me to sit on her.
did you find proof? - Yeah. Two different guys.
let me see it.
that's our victim. Show me the second guy.
who is he? - I don't know.
all right. We're gonna need your memory card.
Yeah, yeah, or you'll charge me with obstruction.
thank you.
I have to go get these plants watered and fertilized.
we have a few more questions, Debbie.
I don't know anything, and I called our lawyer.
and he says I don't have to talk to you. I'm sorry, Jane.
the whole school knew about it the day she lost her virginity.
that mean you think she's hiding something? - Oh, yeah.
NoÔºå sounds good. It's just...
a surprise, you know?
he moved away five years ago. - I know.
it's all different now. I'm different.
I don't need much to get it off the ground.
research is all here for you to look at.
how is he?
he's... He's 16.
tough age.
I'd like to see him.
I'll tell him that.
you and I divorced. I did not divorce him.
it didn't work out the way I'd hoped with his dad.
I'm here for him. I have always been here for him.
think about whether you could ever be here for me again.
she's lovely.
wants to open a yoga studio. She wants me to invest.
I always wanted to learn yoga.
did a class with her at lunch. It's harder than it looks.
so you get a nice space with good energy and some tinkly music.
I'd go.
I could get a yoga body like Melody.
I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but I sort of feel sorry for Emily.
adolescence is such a volatile time.
it probably wasn't easy for her, either.
Oh, it was easy for her thanks to those boobs you saw that arrived special delivery when she was 12.
although large breasts can cause back pain and severe sciatica.
well, turns out they can't protect you from the pain of life.
she said their marriage was perfect. Not anymore.
Oh, I don't think it's been perfect for a while.
bruxism. Hairline cracks indicating excessive grinding due to stress.
Muehrcke lines on his fingernails
another stress indicator.
something was causing him enormous anxiety.
one of the most easygoing guys I've ever met.
Casey called this morning.
he misses you. How romantic.
not so much. It's more like skype-us-interruptus.
like coitus interruptus. I get it.
should I knock? - What have you got?
Debbie Tibbet was just found.
she's dead, Jane.
it appears to be a suicide. - What?
she put this noose around neck and leaned forward.
I don't believe this.
we were just helping her rescue rose bushes a few hours ago.
I'm so, so sorry.
I don't understand.
did your wife seem troubled about anything?
Yes. The last few weeks were terrible.
she was like a different person.
we know about the private investigator you hired to follow her.
Debbie was suddenly so secretive.
did you confront Steve at the reunion?
no, of course not. I didn't know what to do. I...
just...didn't want to lose her.
you understand that we'll have to dig into your life to make sure that's true.
that's okay, Jane. I understand.
do you know who this is?
no.
do you think Debbie killed herself?
I knew her in high school, Eddie.
she didn't.
there's no way.
what do you think? Did she kill herself?
the bruising and deep-tissue injury around the ligature exceeds the circumference of the noose.
15 words where one would do - "no.
not a suicide.
she was strangled by the rope and posed in the chair.
looks like we'll be bringing Eddie in after all.
we still don't have enough on him.
lower back pain, sergeant?
too much of this downward-doggy thing with Melody.
you know back pain is the second most common ailment in the United States?
what's the most common ailment? Your fun facts?
headaches.
so, she's got you doing yoga? This is getting serious.
I've never known her to stick with anything.
maybe she's changed.
by acknowledging her change, you let go of past anger and focus on the present.
thank you, Deepak Maura.
got something. Jared Mckay.
he's an investigative reporter for the Boston Dispatch.
just got off the phone with him.
was he having an affair with Debbie?
no. They went to journalism school together.
Debbie said she had a friend
someone high up in a big company
who wanted to blow the whistle on something.
McKay doesn't know what. Debbie wouldn't give up the name.
well, that has to be Steve Sanner.
he was gonna blow the whistle, but on what?
and why wouldn't Debbie tell us they were meeting?
okay, calm down. What
I'll be right there.
I got another dead classmate.
here, drink this.
it's warm milk with a shot of whiskey.
come on, sit. - Ma, you don't have a liquor license.
so arrest me.
I use it for when I make my chicken pot pie.
Thanks, Mrs. Rizzoli. - Great.
so, now that you're half in the bag, can you tell me what happened?
me and Maria went to friendly's.
I order macaroni and cheese.
she gets a salad, with dressing on the side,'cause she's so fit, like.
then all of a sudden, she says,"oh, my god, my heart's racing.
so I-I think this chick's really digging me, right?
then she stops breathing.
Oh, god. How awful.
Yeah, you're telling me. Waiter calls 911. I start doing cpr.
I wouldn't even know how. - That's comforting, Ma.
well, me neither, except I kind of learned the basics at Tony Abruzzi's bachelor party when this stripper starts
can you just take me back to Maria, please?
all right, so everybody's yelling. It's crazy.
paramedics show up.
and she's dead - right there on friendly's floor.
did Maria ever make contact with Debbie Tibbet from our class?
doubt it. Debbie called her "porky korkman."
I mean, Maria hated Debbie.
boy, that's terrible.
what about Steve Sanner? Did she mention talking to him?
he tried talking to her at the reunion, but what's he need her for, you know?
I mean, Emily's got those friggin'
you could probably appreciate her tits, now, too, right?
what? Excuse me?
so Maria didn't get a chance to talk to Steve at the reunion?
no, no. We left early.
to think I only got two days with the love of my life.
Maria had a congenital heart condition.
cause of death - Heart attack.
Maria Korkman was a preschool teacher.
the same preschool that Steve Sanner was calling?
Yeah. Counted three calls in the last week.
he wanted to talk to her.
bad. I wonder why.
badly.
I hate it when you correct me.
I hate it when you forget about Mr. Adverb.
it's a artificial valve.
the one that Steve's company makes?
Yes.
there's a fracture at the base of the outflow strut and a number of hairline cracks.
you said Maria died of a heart attack because she had a congenital heart condition.
no, I did not. I said she died of a heart attack.
but I didn't know why, and now I do.
she died because the valve failed.
the company is in the process of being bought out by C&S medical.
if they come to terms, the partners stand to make tens of millions.
got the company's list of artificial valve recipients.
3, 200 people received the artificial valve since Graham medical received FDA approval to start production.
look how many of them are kids.
Heart-Valve repair is a very common pediatric surgery.
let's narrow the list. How many recipients have died?
still looking at over 700 names.
can you export "heart attack" as the cause of death?
damn. 118 deaths across the country.
we can't assume that if they died of heart attack it's because they had a defective valve.
I never assume.
were any of them Boston residents?
why, you gonna exhume a body?
Charles gordon, 52, and Rene Watkins, 11.
I'm gonna exhume two.
this is Charles Gordon's valve.
this is Rene Watkins' valve.
both have similar fractures along the outflow strut.
so they're both defective? - Yes.
you think the higher-ups at the company knew their valves were failing?
they've seen the same reports we're looking at.
what are those numbers?
the serial numbers on the valve.
Maura, can you pull up the serial number on the artificial valve that you removed from Maria?
of course.
frost, can you pull up the numbers on the list that you found in Steve's phone?
it's the same number.
steve knew they were making defective valves, and he knew one was in Maria.
that's why he was calling her.
to warn her.
so, Steve told Debbie because she was the only journalist he knew.
but Debbie, the guerilla gardener, wasn't exactly Mike Wallace, so she reached out to her friend Jared, the investigative reporter.
but someone figured out that Steve was about to spill his guts.
and if word of the defective valves got out, no big corporate sale.
and bye-bye to Rory Graham's millions.
crime lab's analysis of the granules found at the crime scene show it's crushed shale, brick, and glass cullet.
it's used on red-clay tennis courts.
and here I thought clay courts were made of clay.
and the crime lab matched the sample to the clay courts at the Maple Leaf court country club.
Oh, where Rory and Kate Graham are members.
Yeah, but it's not enough to arrest him.
no, but it is enough to bring him in just so I can say hi.
sorry to take you away from your game.
you didn't. It was a fast match. I won all three sets.
I'm curious why, at the reunion, you didn't mention the fact that you're selling your company to C&S medical.
I don't comment on business deals until they close.
does C&S medical know they're spending tens of millions of dollars for a flawed valve design?
what are you talking about?
we have proof that your artificial valve is defective.
steve knew that, and he's dead.
you're trying to bait me.
I didn't kill my friend. - Perfect timing.
do you want to read your texts on your own time, Rizzoli?
it's detective Rizzoli.
whatever.
next time you want to chat, call my legal team.
you might want to take a cab.
just got my warrant to search your office and your car.
melody's got me doing a cleanse.
guys really will do anything to get laid.
how is Josh?
I don't know. Haven't seen him.
I'm sorry.
she's talking about moving back.
what if she's only back for money?
do you care?
no, not if I get to see Josh.
been through 10 of these computers we confiscated from Graham biomedical.
nothing so far.
I got something.
I'm friggedy frost, I'm just like ice
I'm always chillin', I'm up on the mike you catchin' a cold because I'm always illin'
I'm wiggedy wow with my style, I got crazy steez and mad flavor, you should call me Mr. Tastee freez.
I could flow.
okay, okay. Now we're talking.
just found a deleted search on how to make a homemade silencer.
was that on Rory's computer? - No, this is Steve Sanner's.
doubt our victim was looking up ways to silently shoot himself.
people carry around their laptops.
his wife, Emily, could have had access to it.
you think she killed him to hang on to their fortune?
wouldn't be the first time.
you know what this is, don't you, Emily?
a water bottle?
is that a filter?
it's a homemade silencer, like the one used to shoot your husband.
what? - We know Steve was about to go public on his company's defective valve.
would have sent C&S medical running for the hills.
no buyout. No big bucks.
but with Steve dead, his share of the company reverts to you.
is that what this is about?
he must have known money never mattered to me.
money matters to everyone.
he was so tortured.
I knew it had something to do with his work.
and why didn't you tell us that before?
I found this tucked into the spokes of my son's bike.
keep your MOTH SHUT. Or you and your kids will die like you husband.
well, I think I know why Debbie didn't come to us earlier.
your boyfriend is on your desk.
twice in two days. A girl could start to feel special.
you are special.
come - I'm at work, all right?
so, tell me how your case is going.
it's bad, Casey.
Debbie Tibbet was found dead.
someone was threatening Emily Sanner.
we know it's about money, but, you know, whoever's doing this is just a serious, cold-blooded killer.
I can't believe it's a classmate.
people do crazy things when they're desperate, you know?
CSRU is processing Rory's car.
okay.
I got to go tear apart an insanely expensive ride.
come to Afghanistan. It's great.
120-degree heat. You can eat dust all day.
you can wear a burka.
Oh, my god. How totally fun.
too bad - Murder calls.
I miss you.
I miss you, too.
I'm hearing everything you're saying.
okay.
Bye, Jane.
Bye, Casey.
traces of red clay on the gas pedal and floor mats.
no blood. - Yeah, Rory was smart.
if he was the shooter, he might have been wearing something to cover his clothes.
let's check the trunk.
Yeah.
can you shine a U. V. Light in here?
look.
that's steel wool, isn't it?
used in the homemade silencer.
there. That's blood.
my office, my car, now you're in my home, Rizzoli?
this is harassment. I'm calling my lawyer.
make sure you mention the blood we found in your trunk.
steve Sanner's blood.
sir, Ma'am, I'm gonna ask these two officers to escort you to your living room.
this is my house. I don't need to go sit in my living room.
honey, they have a warrant.
babe - I'd listen to your lawyer wife.
or we could arrest you for interference with a police officer.
this is bullshit.
I played a set once at Stade Roland Garros
french open.
I'd love to hear about that When we're really old.
can you check that for blood, please?
no sign of blood.
you know, Debbie's killer made it look like she hung herself in a chair.
maybe that's because she wasn't strong enough to lift the body up.
she? - As in, Mrs. Graham?
no, negative for blood.
but there are some rubber pellets embedded in the heel.
those are pieces of artificial turf.
same stuff on the football field where Steve Sanner was shot.
Where's Mrs. Graham?
I let her go to the bathroom.
Kate? Kate, open the door.
in a minute. No, now.
since when am I not allowed to go to the bathroom in my own house?
since you became a murder suspect.
I beg your pardon?
you're under arrest for the murder of Steve Sanner and Debbie Tibbet.
this is ridiculous.
I want my lawyer.
you threatened Debbie, didn't you?
just like in high school, and you scared her, too.
she didn't open her mouth when Steve Sanner was murdered.
this is absurd.
I'm not even gonna dignify that with a response.
you're hurting me.
did you hear a flush? - Nope.
check the tank.
the drive's messed up, but the ceramic disc inside will be just fine.
bet we'll find all of Steve's files on it.
isn't that fantastic, Kate?
why'd you do it?
so you could live like this? With Rory Graham?
I don't care how much money he has.
he's always gonna be a dickhead.
you don't have to tell me that.
get me a drink, babe. Pick up my socks, babe.
you're putting on weight, babe.
what the hell's going on here? - Why don't you tell him, babe?
your wife murdered your best friend and Debbie Tibbet.
you what?
you weren't gonna take care of it.
you didn't even bother to look at your stupid football bro's laptop until I showed you.
we're making broken valves.
why don't we all cry about it like little girls and take down the company?
he wasn't gonna talk!
cuff him.
wait, what? - You're under arrest for the murder of Maria Korkman.
Maria Korkman? The fat chick from high school?
no, the preschool teacher who died from one of your valves, the first of many of your victims, which is second-degree murder... Babe.
let's go.
when you invited me to play, I thought you meant on actual courts.
this is how I used to play when I was a kid.
we can go to my club.
they have fresh mint lemonade.
free refills? - Yes!
No!
so, Casey called this morning again.
and I got those little butterflies in my stomach like I was 17 again.
release of epinephrine.
draws blood away from the stomach and sends it to the muscles.
you are lovesick.
the one who misses it gets it.
lovesick? - Run.
it might balance high dopamine and norepinephrine levels present because of your inability to consummate.
stop. I will get the ball.
I'll race you for it.
heads up!
uh, hey, Enzo's hereÔºüÔºüÔºü
ha ha! - What up, bro?
doing good. You? - I can't complain. Business is good.
you bring me cupcakes? Yeah, I got them all working at the bakery.
how's Marcus? - Not good. Has to have surgery.
same as what happened to you. - Damn.
Where's he at?
you can clean my ride.
then let's talk. - Okay.
Oh, my god. Call 911!
somebody get us a towel!
come on, buddy. - Let's keep pressure on it.
come on, Enzo. - Come on, buddy.
no, seriously, I don't mind working on Sundays.
Yeah, murderers tend to take a break on the Lord's day.
what about that mattapan triple homicide? Well, expect for that, yeah.
frost, your mom's here. - Hey, mom.
how'd you get here so fast? We got off to an early start, no traffic on the 95.
Hey. - Hey, Robin.
what are you doing here? Oh, Cameron's on vacation.
he was bored, so, never been to Boston.
Hey, Cam. - Hey.
we're gonna ride the duck boat.
cool, man. - Hi, Camille.
Jane. How are you? - I'm good.
thank you. It's been a long time.
this is Robin, my mom's roommate, and her son, Cameron.
so nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I'm Jane. Hi.
Hi. - This is my brother Frankie.
Hey, how you doing? How come you don't have a police uniform?
actually, Detectives don't wear uniforms. But I'm just on call today.
we're gonna go play some softball. Wait for us!
are you going bowling? - No. We want to play for Boston Police Department's softball league.
heads up! Oop.
Yeah.
good job breaking it in. - Take off the tag.
goodbye, playoffs.
uh... shoot. The season's almost over, so, you know, may... maybe next year.
bummer. - Hold on.
let me make sure I understand. Your science colleagues, who, for all you know, could be world-class softball stars, aren't welcome at your softball practice?
uh... well...
Dr. Isles.
okay. I'll be right there.
we're not done here. - Okay.
victim is Enzo Womack.
the running back from BCU? The dessertier from End Zone Cakes?
did you just say "dessertier"? Enzo Womack is a well-known cakemaker.
he just opened his first D.I.Y. on Charles street?
"Decorate it yourself." It's on my bucket list.
what happened? - Stabbed twice in the neck.
he was probably here to support the BCU fundraiser. Any witnesses?
happened in the car wash. Nobody saw anything. We got a hundred people in and out of here.
it's a huge intersection. We don't have one witness?
once you drive in, it's just you, your vehicle, and automated equipment for six minutes.
maybe someone was hiding in the van.
do we know where he was coming from? - His bakery, End Zone Cakes.
his nickname was "End Zone" 'cause he made so many touchdowns.
who removed his body from the van? - Dan Mackenzie, team trainer.
he and the coach tried to revive him. Mackenzie and Enzo were friends.
Yeah, I think they played together. Yeah, Mackenzie was a kicker. Played together for four seasons.
team's a mess. - So is the crime scene.
found his cellphone.
I got a bad feeling this isn't gonna be much help.
all right, let's get the van back to the evidence garage. So much for a slow Sunday.
what if I practiced my swing in that cagey thing?
it's called a batting cage, Maura. I'm looking for Sergeant Detective Korsak.
what is he doing here?
Jane. - Hi.
I didn't know you'd be here today. - I work here.
Hello, Maura.
Casey, how are you? - I'm okay.
uh, I'll ... I'll just meet you downstairs.
okay. - Okay.
I'm sorry. That wasn't much of a greeting.
let me start again. - Okay.
Hello, Jane. - Hello. It's good to see you.
I said I'd, uh, be in touch when I was ready.
so, I'm guessing you're not ready.
it's complicated. I'm getting closer, though.
okay. So ... so, why are you here? I need to talk to, uh, Sergeant Korsak.
Elsie! Hey!
Hello, girl. Hi, Casey. - Hey, Vince.
all right, well, you know, I don't want to get between you and Korsak.
Oh, I just stopped by to ask if he would watch Elsie for me.
God, it's good to see you. - You can see me anytime you want.
I'll be in touch.
I promise... I will. - Well, you know where I am.
I am that kid that open the boxes that said "do not open this until christmas."
no, I mean in November. - Uh-huh.
ma caught me crawling under her bed looking for my birthday presents.
are you getting how major this is? Maura, you're not even listening.
you have been talking about Casey for 31 minutes.
I'm having an epiphany here, a watershed moment.
I am having a life-altering experience.
can you hand me the metal probe?
Yes.
I mean, Casey gave me the perfect opportunity to be my impatient self ...
you know, to pressure him and demand answers, and ... and I didn't.
me. I was patient.
isn't that amazing? Yes. Can you hand me the forceps?
okay, you cannot still be upset about the softball thing.
this softball thing.
I-I put my pride on the line and beg to be included in an extracurricular activity in front of my employees.
why is it so important to you?
why is it so important to build interdepartmental bridges?
you've clearly never played in a softball league.
you just don't want us to play because you're too competitive and you don't think we're any good.
I'm right, aren't I? - Yes.
at least you're honest. He still has remarkable musculature.
he must not eat his cakes. - Yeah.
Enzo was the first BCU player in years who could have gone pro.
I'm guessing that wasn't an option once he tore his anterior cruciate ligament.
scar tissue looks to be about five years old.
BCU going for the money with a hand-off to end zone.
man, he was fast.
Oh, no! Womack is tackled hard.
it's amazing how fast your life can change.
all it took for Casey was an I. E.D. and some shrapnel.
and a war.
my guess is Casey dropped by to see you.
stop guessing. You're bad at it.
he came by to see Korsak.
Oh, stop timing me. I'll stop talking about Casey.
there are hilt marks... there and there.
those are probably from the knife.
a small buck knife, maybe? - Well, many knives have hilts ...
survival knives, hunting knives, skinning knives, commando knives, tanto knives.
can you please stop?
some kind of particulate matter adhered to the wound.
well, that must have come off the knife. - And white fibers ... there.
I'll have the crime lab analyze all this.
okay, the victim's van is in the evidence garage. I'll be back.
will you think about the, uh, "softball thing"?
Yes. - Thank you.
sorry, the answer's still no.
we got a bunch of cake-decorating stuff.
it's all covered with arterial blood spray and car-wash suds. Killer was smart.
he ruined any chance we had of making a case with forensics.
doesn't it seem a little spur of the moment, stabbing someone in a car wash?
Yeah. I'll get it all photographed and tested.
Where's Frost? - Well, the warrant came through.
he's working on Enzo's laptop and still trying to dry out his cellphone.
okay, I'll have the crime lab comparison-test all the tools and knives in here.
Maura thinks that the murder weapon had a hilt.
this has a hilt. - I didn't know he was coming.
Yeah, I figured.
he asked a lot of questions about you. Really?
why did he leave Elsie? - I'm taking care of her for a while.
he knew if he brought her by, I couldn't refuse her. You're taking care of her? For how long?
maybe a few months.
Why? Where's he going? - He didn't go into details.
well, You're a Detective. Didn't you ask?
I didn't want to pry! - Oh, that's so male.
you think this is frosting? - Maybe. Crime lab can test it.
look, we got at least several years' worth of frosting and cake crumbs.
what the hell is "fun-dant"? - Fondant.
and it's sticky, sweet, inedible crap that they put on cakes.
don't put it on retirement cake. - Duly noted.
Ohh. You're a good girl, Elsie.
Oh, she's the best. - And you're a service dog.
Casey needs you, so what are you doing here?
Hey, Ma. This is Detective Frost's mother, Camille.
Oh. Nice to meet you. I'm Angela. Hi. Pleasure.
you okay waiting here? - Yes, yes.
and thank you so much for taking us around.
sure. See ya, Ma. - Bye, babe.
what a nice man.
he drove me and my roommate and her son all over Boston while we were waiting for Barry.
Yeah, he's a good kid.
and, uh, your son and my daughter, Jane, are like this.
I wish I lived closer. I feel like I never see him.
you live in, uh, Virginia, right? - Norfolk.
I teach at one of the military universities there. Nice. What do you teach?
civil engineering. - Wow.
well, now we know where, uh, Detective Frost gets his brains.
his father was actually pretty smart, too.
uh, we divorced 20 years ago. I just got divorced.
Oh, I'm so sorry. - I'm not.
well, anymore. Can I get you a cup of coffee?
Oh, no, thank you.
I think I already had enough on the way here.
I'm actually trying to work up the nerve to tell Barry that I'm getting remarried.
Oh. Congratulations. Why is that making you nervous?
the divorce was hard on him.
and I never dated. Well, don't get me wrong.
Barry is very respectful, but knowing him, you know, he has strong opinions.
well, we did bring them up to have their own minds.
Yes, we did.
it's crazy how the tables turn, isn't it?
I was seeing this guy for a while, and, uh, my kids went nuts.
What'd you do? - Felt guilty.
but then I decided I was allowed to be a person, too.
Yes, you are. - Excuse me.
I think you need to complain about your lunch order.
there's a phone in it. Rice is an effective desiccant.
are you using three-syllable words because your mother's in town?
Oh, man. I might be. Can you make it work?
I'm not sure. Circuits are wet. But I've been having fun on Enzo's laptop.
he liked three things.
let me guess ... women, cakes, and BCU football.
what a life ... football, women, and cake.
Enzo was a season-ticket holder. And he also had every BCU game from the last 10 years on his hard drive.
that's a serious fan. - Dude was hardcore.
he watched every game and a lot of replays.
pretty sure viewing football on his computer didn't kill him. Yeah, and I remember him to be quite the ladies' man.
what about the women in his life?
Ho-ho-ho! Nice assortment of desserts.
I meant the cupcakes. - Yeah, sure you did.
most of them are his old girlfriends. - He hired his old flames?
which flavor would you choose, Korsak?
chocolate? Vanilla? - So many cupcakes, so little time.
okay, I'm about to file a harassment claim.
it has to be hostile and offensive. - Keep talking.
Enzo updated his schedule on this internal calendar.
well, he posted he was going to the car-wash fundraiser.
who had access to that calendar? - Just his employees.
you mean just his ex-girlfriends?
check this out.
Where'd you find that photo? - She posted it on candidgram.
she posted selfies all day long. Okay, who's Laura Stephens?
she looks like an employee. I'll check.
she's 24. She's a cake decorator at End Zone Cakes.
all right, well, come on.
Maura's mad at me, so let's give her a cheap thrill, and she can comparison-test the cake knives.
uh... meet me at the elevator.
what's up?
you know how I drove Frost's mom and her roommate around? Yeah.
well, I think they're, uh... you know.
no, I don't know. - I think they're a couple.
What?! Does Frost know?
never mind. Don't answer that. It ... it's none of our business.
no way he knows. She was married ... to his father. Well, what makes you think they're a couple?
Jane, they're a couple. - It's not of our business.
what's none of your business?
we were... just talking about Ma.
it sounded like you were talking about her love life. No. Menopause.
we were talking about menopause. - Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
it's none of our business if Ma's in menopause. See ya.
Ugh. You ready? - Yes.
we should... get Maura and go.
Boston homicide. - What are you doing about Enzo?
what's your name? - Valentina Smith.
how could you let this happen? Car washes are supposed to be safe!
uh, what was your relationship to him?
we went to college together. I'm his office manager.
were you two involved? - In college.
we haven't slept together in years.
and where were you this morning? - Delivering a wedding cake.
we'll need to verify that. - Whatever.
I'm not about to kill my boss. - We'd like to talk to Laura Stephens.
everybody here was his friend. We're working on a cake for his memorial service now.
they're making the Boston Cambridge University football stadium.
Oh, look! It's a little Enzo. And this is a representation of heaven.
and I think that that golden ladder is so he can ascend. - Uh, Dr. Isles?
the comparison test? - Oh, yes, of course.
damn, Enzo liked them in all shapes, sizes, and colors.
is that harassment? - Possibly, yes.
you'll interfere with my process if you come any closer.
we'd like to talk to you about Enzo Womack. Can you just wait a sec?
crap, you made me bump the chin strap.
are these your knives? - Don't touch them.
I'll need a clay impression for a comparison test. I didn't kill him, all right?
a woman definitely killed that bastard, though. How do you know a woman killed him?
you think you can sleep with a girl, buy her brunch, whisper sweet bullshit in her ear, and then say, "let's be friends, 'kay?"
you think you can do that over and over? We found this photo you posted, Laura.
it was a joke. - It doesn't seem that funny to me.
me neither.
that looks pretty sharp. - It's a flower pin.
you should talk to everybody. Enzo strung us all along. "Let's be friends, 'kay?
no, not okay. - So, why'd you work for him?
do you know how hard it is to find a decent job in this economy?
I have a major in gender studies. - Ooh. Yeah, I know what you mean.
well, it seems to me that Enzo gave you a reason to kill him, Laura.
he did, but I didn't. I was at the gym. You can check.
they take a picture when they swipe it. I want it back. I have to work out later today.
it's a shame that Laura has a solid alibi.
still, I think Enzo was playing a dangerous game.
you think, uh, too many notches on the bedpost got him killed?
maybe. Okay, Maura's finished testing all the knives.
our murder weapon is not at that bakery.
so, it's nice that Robin came with your mom, you know, so she could have some company.
my mom's really independent, but, yeah, I guess.
how do they know each other? They're both professors at the naval university in Norfolk.
I didn't know your mom was a professor.
my mom was in one of the first classes at the naval academy that allowed women.
are you kidding me? - She's amazing.
she and my dad were midshipmen together.
that's how they met. He had the career she should have.
and they're roommates, y-your mom and Robin?
after Robin's divorce, they decided to share expenses. Professors don't make that much.
well, it's good they have each other. I mean to ... to share expenses.
no kidding. - Come on. Let's call it a day.
we got two games left in the season, and if we don't get in a practice today, the drug unit's gonna kick our ass.
since you put it that way... You think it's okay if... if I bring my mom?
Oh, and ... and Robin and Cameron, too?
sure. - Yeah.
can't believe you weren't gonna tell us about practice.
okay... look, there are only two more games left in the season, and ... and we'll be disqualified. You're not part of homicide.
Oh, so Frost's mom is part of homicide?
Jane, we could buck up sides and have a scrimmage.
buck up? Who are you, opie?
who's opie? - Shh. Honey.
Maura, you ... you don't have enough players for a team.
Oh, we'd be happy to play for Maura's team. Yeah. Why not?
we're just a couple of old ladies looking for some exercise. All right.
all right. So, you're gonna have to buck up, Jane.
I'd love to.
it's only fair that the winners buy the losers drinks.
Korsak got to take Cameron to buy an ice cream. We got to endure this?
lab results, Dr. Isles. - Thank you.
all the identifiable organic substances in the van were glucose-based confectioner's compounds.
swell. - And blood and glycerin from the soap.
double swell. - There was one exception.
the blue substance that you found on the rear floor mat is bulk field paint.
field paint? BCU's colors are blue and...
Susie, can you check and see if that field paint is from BCU?
Yeah, sure. - Thank you.
Oh, just two old ladies in need of some exercise.
I think somebody lied.
it wasn't a lie. We are old ladies.
and we needed exercise. - It was such an exciting game.
6: 1. We trounced you. - "We"?
Camille hit two home runs, and Robin hit a grand slam. So 2 for you, 4 for you, and zero for you.
exactly. And is it a "we" when you got two ringers?
Oh, my god! You knew.
well, I figured Robin's swing had lost some power.
frost! And mom ... you haven't played in a while.
we thought we were rustier than we were.
we scored one run ... one.
I think you played really well. - The drug unit's gonna destroy us.
well, not if you let us play. And by "us," you mean Camille and Robin?
you're a very sore loser. I did make it to the first base.
you don't say "the." - What?
you made it to first base because you were walked. You know, walking's good.
to the walk. - To the walk.
walk Walking.
Ow! Why are you kicking my leg?
I s-should hand it to Robin and Camille.
Jane, did you hurt your neck? Are you having a muscle spasm?
Really?
I'd like to propose a toast. - That's great sportsmanship.
see? Toasting the winning team.
uh, to two wonderful people who have taught me the meaning of love and commitment ...
my mom... and her partner, Robin.
Barry, you knew? - Yeah, mom, I knew.
I had been agonizing over this for years. You never brought it up. It wasn't my business.
honey. I figured if you wanted to tell me, you would.
I told you. You've never given him enough credit. I just wish I'd known.
how many times have I invited you to Massachusetts?
I kept hoping you'd make an honest woman out of her.
I'm glad you finally have. - Thank you.
Congratulations. - Yes, congratulations.
when is the wedding day? We actually haven't even set the date yet.
it's ... it was just time to tell you, Barry. I couldn't get married without you.
you'll be our best man? - You know I will.
Oh, and I have a great dress I haven't worn yet. You haven't been invited.
listen, when we have our wedding, you'll all be welcome.
we'd love to have you join us. All right, well, this calls for champagne.
losing team is buying. - Hear, hear!
as long as winning team stops mocking. - Sorry, sorry!
Hi. - What are you doing here?
I wanted to apologize. - Oh? What did you do?
come inside. - I can't.
I'm so sorry. We ... we can talk out here. I don't mean I can't make it up your stairs.
I mean I don't want to go inside.
where are you going? - Upstairs to hear your apology.
it might take me a while.
good. I have to put my glove away.
no. Okay.
okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay.
um, coming!
coming. Coming. Okay.
Hey. Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.
uh, come in. Um, sit down.
can ... can I get you a beer or...
maybe a water. - A water. Okay.
Thanks.
I remember the last time I was here.
right before your last tour in Afghanistan.
my final tour.
it's like the last run on a ski slope.
you know as you're falling you shouldn't have taken it.
thank you for coming up. I-I know you didn't want to.
I did. I ju... I didn't want to be this close to you.
please. - I'm sorry.
I asked Sergeant Korsak to look after Elsie because I'm having surgery.
surgery? W-when? - Soon.
the stem-cell trials? - No. I'm not a candidate.
I found a neurosurgeon.
he thinks he can remove the, uh, shrapnel and bone shards from pressing against my spinal cord.
Casey, that's incredible. - There are no guarantees, and, uh... and there will be months of rehab.
but it's the first crack of light I've seen in a pretty dark tunnel.
well, let me ... let me help you.
I-I want to go through this with you. That's exactly why I didn't get in touch.
Casey... I-it doesn't matter, okay?
I care about you. - No.
this is no way to start a relationship, and this is where we are ... at the beginning.
okay, well, let's get to the middle. I want to do this.
taking care of an invalid is an ugly form of intimacy. There's no romance in it, Jane.
this injury isn't you. This is you.
I should have asked you not to go.
I should have asked you to wait.
did you see someone else while I was gone?
Yes.
did you care about him?
Yes.
then you'll find someone again. - What? No.
Casey, wait a minute. Wait.
it's over with him. It's ... it's been over.
look, I realized that when I saw you again how much I want this to work.
this won't work. - It will.
Casey, please, just give me a chance. Please.
do one thing for me. - Anything.
let me kiss you... and then let me go.
Casey, please, please.
goodbye, Jane.
where do socks go? - All you need is a half-inch gap for them to slip under the agitator paddle.
so not sock heaven.
check your drawers.
static electricity causes them to stick to other clothing.
I hope Enzo gets to go to football heaven.
thank you for coming. - Don't throw them away!
they don't have partners. They're making me sad.
okay. Tell me what he said.
he is having surgery to remove bone and shrapnel.
what? What's with the weird look?
it's nothing. - Hives, Maura.
even white lies make you itch.
okay. Casey's condition is called cauda equina syndrome.
from what I've observed in him, it probably involves T-11 and 12 and maybe l-1.
same question ... why the weird look?
surgery on a partially impaired paraplegic is very risky.
well, you're not a neurosurgeon. - You're right. I'm not.
so no guessing.
I just want to pretend like it's all gonna be fine.
can you do that with me? - I can try.
salute, Elsie. Good girl! Good salute, Elsie.
that wasn't a salute. - Yes, it was.
looked like "shake" to me. Anybody want a bagel?
Yeah. Thanks. All right, so, where are we?
we are nowhere. - We better get somewhere or Cavanaugh's gonna tear off some heads.
maybe I can help.
thanks to the team-building softball game, the crime lab stayed up all night to get these results to you.
I thought they were helping us solve murders because ...
Oh, I don't know... it's their job.
the blue paint on the floor mat is consistent with the paint used for the BCU field stencils.
that's right where the killer would have been. Frost, you said that Enzo had season tickets.
was he at Saturday's game? - No. His ticket wasn't used, so I followed up with his office manager.
Enzo had to work on a wedding cake. - It was the first game of the season, which means Enzo didn't transfer that field paint inside his van.
maybe our murderer did.
I didn't mean anything when I looked at it, but watch this.
Enzo was watching this clip from Saturday's game.
what kind of call is that?
coach Phillips? What do we know about him?
Jane, what would be the motive? Enzo hadn't played for him for five years.
phillips was a contender for a division I coaching gig.
it went away after BCU lost that season five years ago.
am I disappointed? Yeah, yeah, I'm disappointed.
coaching a division 1 team is a dream of mine.
but, uh, BCU ...
we had a great run there Till Enzo hurt himself.
sounds like phillips blames Enzo.
well, that blue paint only tells us that our killer was on that field.
frost, you get the phone working yet? No. Got to put the battery back in.
okay, I want to see what else Enzo was watching the night before he was killed.
his laptop is in bric. - Okay.
sergeant Korsak, did Casey tell you why he needed you to take Elsie?
no. He just said she might need a home for a few months.
he mentioned something I didn't want Jane to hear. What was that?
he made me promise I would take care of Elsie if anything happened to him.
Hey, you guys coming? - Yep.
okay. We got one shot at this.
if there's any moisture, the circuits will fry themselves.
turn it on. - Do I have witnesses?
sergeant Detective Korsak is telling me to turn this phone on. Turn the damn phone on, Frost.
I want it in writing that this one is not on me if this phone...
it's dead. So much for your rice idea.
this is the whole list of video files Enzo was watching. Can you play that one?
BCU going for the money with a hand-off to end zone.
Wow! Look at Womack as he breaks to the strong sie and ... oh, no!
he's not getting up. Folks, this does not look good.
why was Enzo watching that? You see the right guard?
Yeah. - Yeah.
I didn't. What are you talking about? Let's see that again.
the normally sure-footed right guard looks like he slips on the turf.
and there goes hard-charging Der'on Martin flying in at full speed.
Enzo is down! Ouch!
frost, play that clip from Saturday's game.
Marcus to the right on a hand-off. Oh! How did that happen?
looks like BCU's right guard lost his footing and left running back Jeff Marcus unprotected for that nasty hit.
Ouch! It reminds me of that hit that ended Enzo Womack's carer five years ago.
I think we just figured out what got Enzo killed.
Oh! That was a nasty hit.
what? What did ... what did you see? I'd like to know what got Enzo killed.
both BCU right guards, who played five years apart, faked the same trip on the same play.
to make sure their running back got tackled and didn't score.
this is like the day I took that A. P. calculus exam.
you know, I couldn't have solved that inverse derivative problem if my life depended on it.
calm down. Calm down, okay? For once, I get to explain something to you.
frost, can you freeze both bad plays?
that right guard and at least one other player ...
probably the quarterback... fixed that game in 2007.
okay, and that right guard fixed the same play five years later.
are you saying BCU players from two separate seasons threw games?
altered games. It's too easy to get caught if you throw them. If you just shave points...
frost, can we see both quarterbacks?
Yeah, right there. Both quarterbacks made identical signals.
that says to me, "we're throwing the play."
watch their eyes right before they tap their helmets.
Yeah, you're right.
we have a shot caller ... who are they looking at?
frost, do you have any other angles? So, Enzo must have realized the trip that ended his career wasn't accidental.
but why would the right guard fake a trip? Enzo was his teammate.
the players who were cheating weren't trying to hurt him. They were just trying to keep him from scoring.
to change the over/under.
that's what this is about. - Of course.
what? Over/under what? Over/under is a type of bet.
oddsmakers announce a number before a game. It's their best guess of what the final combined score will be.
and I can bet over or under that number.
Yes. - Okay, I think I understand.
so if the teams' scores, when added together, are lower than predicted, I win.
Yes. And if you know that there are dirty players that are fixing the game to keep the score down, you bet on the under, and then you win big.
Yeah, but why would a college player cheat, especially at a prestigious academic university?
well, BCU is a division 3 football program. There's no money, no scholarships.
they're having a car-wash fundraiser to buy equipment. Got another angle... sideline camera.
coach Phillips is the shot caller. I don't think so. Play it again.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, play both the 2007 game and Saturday's game.
watch Mackenzie.
you see that? He dropped the towel both times.
uh, the results are back on the substance found in Enzo's wounds.
it's analgesic heat rub. And the fibers I found were from cotton sports tape.
you said the murder weapon had a hilt? Could it be a multipurpose tool, like this one?
Yes.
is that Enzo's phone? Okay, you don't get credit for fixing it.
give it to me. - No.
I can look at cellphones, too. - Give it to me and let me plug it in.
thank you.
here's his last text message. To Dan Mackenzie, 7: 54 A. M.
right before he went to the car wash. "Need to talk. I hope I'm crazy."
I think coach has BCU players shaving points.
he thought his coach was dirty. - "I hope I'm crazy.
we didn't want to accuse the program he loved unless he was sure he was right.
so he went to the person he trusted the most ... his former teammate Dan Mackenzie.
it shouldn't be so swollen. How many times I got to tell you to ice this sucker, huh?
Hey, you can't be in here. There's no women allowed.
BCU just made an exception. - Well, what's this about?
we checked your stats, Dan. You were a good field-goal kicker.
but suddenly, you started missing.
was that when it started? - When what started?
you were missing kicks to shave points. I don't know what you guys are talking about.
we're talking about basic greed.
living pretty large for a guy making $40, 000 as a D-3 athletic trainer.
I want a lawyer. - You came up with this scheme in college, but you knew Enzo wouldn't cheat 'cause he was a good guy.
and he was going to the pros. You weren't.
he ... he ... he was accusing the team of cheating.
he was gonna give the BCU program a bad name. Enzo sent you a text before you killed him.
he thought coach Phillips was corrupting the players. It never occurred to him it was his friend.
you're under arrest for the murder of Enzo Womack.
Hey. What are you doing here?
I know you wanted me to pretend that everything will be fine.
what's that? - It's some research I did on decompressive lumbar spine surgery.
I don't want to know. - Jane, you need to know.
Why? I mean, he said goodbye, Maura, so...
Jane, if you care about him, you'll look.
how bad is it?
bad.
what am I gonna do? - I wish I knew.
uh, hey, Enzo's here.
what up, bro?
doing good. You? - I can't complain. Business is good.
you bring me cupcakes?
Yeah, I got them all working at the bakery.
how's Marcus?
not good. Has to have surgery.
same as what happened to you. - Damn.
Where's he at?
you can clean my ride.
then let's talk. - Okay.
Oh, my god. Call 911!
somebody get us a towel!
come on, buddy. - Let's keep pressure on it.
come on, Enzo. - Come on, buddy.
no, seriously, I don't mind working on Sundays.
Yeah, murderers tend to take a break on the Lord's day.
what about that Mattapan triple homicide?
well, expect for that, yeah.
frost, your mom's here. - Hey, mom.
how'd you get here so fast?
we got off to an early start, no traffic on the 95.
Hey, Robin.
what are you doing here?
Oh, Cameron's on vacation. He was bored, so, never been to Boston.
Hey, Cam.
we're gonna ride the duck boat.
cool, man. - Hi, Camille.
Jane. How are you? - I'm good. Thank you. It's been a long time.
this is Robin, my mom's roommate, and her son, Cameron.
so nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I'm Jane. Hi
this is my brother Frankie.
Hey, how you doing?
how come you don't have a police uniform?
actually, Detectives don't wear uniforms.
but I'm just on call today.
we're gonna go play some softball.
wait for us!
heads up! Oop.
Yeah.
good job breaking it in. - Take off the tag.
goodbye, playoffs.
uh... Shoot. The season's almost over, so, you know, may... Maybe next year.
bummer. - Hold on.
let me make sure I understand. Your science colleagues, who, for all you know, could be world-class softball stars, aren't welcome at your softball practice?
no - well...
Dr. Isles.
okay. I'll be right there.
we're not done here. - Okay.
victim is Enzo Womack.
the running back from BCU? The dessertier from End Zone Cakes?
did you just say "dessertier"?
Enzo Womack is a well-known cake maker.
he just opened his first D. I.Y. on Charles street.
"Decorate it yourself." It's on my bucket list.
what happened? - Stabbed twice in the neck.
he was probably here to support the BCU fundraiser.
any witnesses?
happened in the car wash. Nobody saw anything.
we got a hundred people in and out of here.
it's a huge intersection. We don't have one witness?
maybe someone was hiding in the van.
do we know where he was coming from? - His bakery, End Zone Cakes.
his nickname was "End Zone" 'cause he made so many touchdowns.
who removed his body from the van?
Dan Mackenzie, team trainer.
he and the coach tried to revive him.
Mackenzie and Enzo were friends.
Yeah, I think they played together.
Yeah, Mackenzie was a kicker.
played together for four seasons.
team's a mess.
so is the crime scene.
found his cellphone.
I got a bad feeling this isn't gonna be much help.
all right, let's get the van back to the evidence garage.
so much for a slow Sunday.
what if I practiced my swing in that cagey thing?
it's called a batting cage, Maura.
I'm looking for sergeant detective Korsak.
what is he doing here?
I didn't know you'd be here today.
I work here.
Hello, Maura. - Casey, how are you?
I'm okay.
uh, I'll...I'll just meet you downstairs.
okay. - okay.
I'm sorry. That wasn't much of a greeting.
let me start again. - Okay.
Hello, Jane. - Hello. It's good to see you.
I said I'd, uh, be in touch when I was ready.
so, I'm guessing you're not ready.
it's complicated. I'm getting closer, though.
okay. So...So, why are you here?
I need to talk to, uh, sergeant Korsak.
Hello, girl. Hi, Casey.
Hey, Vince.
all right, well, you know, I don't want to get between you and Korsak.
Oh, I just stopped by to ask if he would watch Elsie for me.
God, it's good to see you.
you can see me anytime you want.
I'll be in touch.
I promise I will.
well, you know where I am.
I am the kid that opened the boxes that said "do not open until Christmas."
no, I mean in November.
ma caught me crawling under her bed looking for my birthday presents.
are you getting how major this is?
Maura, you're not even listening.
you have been talking about Casey for 31 minutes.
I'm having an epiphany here, a watershed moment.
I am having a life-altering experience.
can you hand me the metal probe?
Yes.
I mean, Casey gave me the perfect opportunity to be my impatient self.
you know, to pressure him and demand answers, and...and I didn't.
me. I was patient.
isn't that amazing? - Yes.
can you hand me the forceps?
okay, you cannot still be upset about the softball thing.
this "softball thing."
I-I put my pride on the line and beg to be included in an extracurricular activity in front of my employees.
why is it so important to you?
why is it so important to build interdepartmental bridges?
you've clearly never played in a softball league.
you just don't want us to play because you're too competive and you don't think we're any good.
I'm right, aren't I? - Yes.
at least you're honest.
he still has remarkable musculature.
he must not eat his cakes.
Yeah. Enzo was the first bcu player in years who could have gone pro.
I'm guessing that wasn't an option once he tore his anterior cruciate ligament.
scar tissue looks to be about five years old.
BCU going for the money with a hand-off to end zone.
man, he was fast.
Oh, no! Womack is tackled hard.
he's not getting up.
folks, this does not look good.
it's amazing how fast your life can change.
all it took for Casey was an I. E.D. And some shrapnel.
and a war.
my guess is Casey dropped by to see you.
stop guessing.
you're bad at it.
he came by to see Korsak.
Oh, stop timing me. I'll stop talking about Casey.
there are hilt marks... There and there.
those are probably from the knife.
a small buck knife, maybe?
well, many knives have hilts.
survival knives, hunting knives, skinning knives, commando knives, tanto knives.
can you please stop?
some kind of particulate matter adhered to the wound.
well, that must have come off the knife.
and white fibers -- there.
I'll have the crime lab analyze all this.
okay, the victim's van is in the evidence garage.
I'll be back.
will you think about the, uh,"softball thing"?
Yes. - Thank you.
sorry, the answer's still no.
we got a bunch of cake-decorating stuff.
it's all covered with arterial blood spray and car-wash suds.
killer was smart.
he ruined any chance we had of making a case with forensics.
doesn't it seem a little spur of the moment, stabbing someone in a car wash?
Yeah.
I'll get it all photographed and tested.
Where's Frost?
well, the warrant came through.
he's working on Enzo's laptop and still trying to dry out his cellphone.
okay, I'll have the crime lab comparison-test all the tools and knives in here.
Maura thinks that the murder weapon had a hilt.
this has a hilt.
I didn't know he was coming.
Yeah, I figured.
he asked a lot of questions about you.
Really?
why did he leave Elsie?
I'm taking care of her for a while.
he knew if he brought her by, I couldn't refuse her.
you're taking care of her? For how long?
maybe a few months. - Why? Where's he going?
he didn't go into details.
you're a detective. Didn't you ask?
I didn't want to pry!
Oh, that's so male.
you think this is Frosting?
maybe. Crime lab can test it.
look, we got at least several years' worth of Frosting and cake crumbs.
what the hell is "fun-dant"?
fondant.
and it's sticky, sweet, inedible crap that they put on cakes.
don't put it on my retirement cake.
duly noted.
you're a good girl, Elsie.
Oh, she's the best.
and you're a service dog.
Casey needs you, so what are you doing here?
Hey, ma. This is detective Frost's mother, Camille.
nice to meet you. I'm Angela.
pleasure.
you okay waiting here?
Yes, yes.
and thank you so much for taking us around.
sure.
see ya, ma. - Bye, babe.
what a nice man.
he drove me and my roommate and her son all over Boston while we were waiting for Barry.
Yeah, he's a good kid.
and, uh, your son and my daughter, Jane, are like this.
I wish I lived closer. I feel like I never see him.
you live in, uh, Virginia, right?
Norfolk.
I teach at one of the military universities there.
nice. What do you teach?
civil engineering.
well, now we know where, uh, detective Frost gets his brains.
his father was actually pretty smart, too.
uh, we divorced 20 years ago.
I just got divorced.
Oh, I'm so sorry. - I'm not.
well, anymore.
can I get you a cup of coffee?
Oh, no, thank you.
I think I already had enough on the way here.
I'm actually trying to work up the nerve to tell Barry that I'm getting remarried.
Congratulations.
why is that making you nervous?
the divorce was hard on him.
and I never dated.
well, don't get me wrong. Barry is very respectful, but knowing him, you know, he has strong opinions.
well, we did bring them up to have their own minds.
Yes, we did.
it's crazy how the tables turn, isn't it?
I was seeing this guy for a while, and, uh, my kids went nuts.
What'd you do?
felt guilty.
but then I decided I was allowed to be a person, too.
Yes, you are.
excuse me.
I think you need to complain about your lunch order. There's a phone in it.
rice is an effective desiccant.
are you using three-syllable words because your mother's in town?
Oh, man.
I might be.
can you make it work?
I'm not sure. Circuits are wet. But I've been having fun on Enzo's laptop.
he liked three things.
let me guess -- women, cakes, and bcu football.
what a life -- football, women, and cake.
Enzo was a season-ticket holder.
and he also had every bcu game from the last 10 years on his hard drive.
that's a serious fan.
dude was hardcore. He watched every game and a lot of replays.
pretty sure viewing football on his computer didn't kill him.
Yeah, and I remember him to be quite the ladies' man.
what about the women in his life?
nice assortment of desserts.
I meant the cupcakes.
Yeah, sure you did.
most of them are his old girlfriends.
he hired his old flames?
which flavor would you choose, Korsak?
chocolate? Vanilla?
so many cupcakes, so little time.
okay, I'm about to file a harassment claim.
it has to be hostile and offensive.
keep talking.
Enzo updated his schedule on this internal calendar.
well, he posted he was going to the car-wash fundraiser.
who had access to that calendar?
just his employees.
you mean just his ex-girlfriends?
check this out.
what I'd like to do to my ex-boyfriend.- Where'd you find that photo?
she posted it on Candidgram.
she posted selfies all day long.
Okay,who's Laura Stephens? - She looks like an employee.I'll check.
she's 24. She's a cake decorator at end zone cakes.
all right, well, come on.
Maura's mad at me,so let's give her a cheap thrill,and she can comparison-test the cake knives.
uh... Meet me at the elevator.
what's up?
you know how I drove Frost's mom and her roommate around?
Yeah. Well,I think they're,uh... You know.
no, I don't know.
I think they're a couple. - What?! Does Frost know?
never mind.Don't answer that.It -- It's none of our business.
no way he knows. She was married -- to his father.
well, what makes you think they're a couple?
Jane, they're a couple.
it's none of our business.
what's none of your business?
we were...just talking about ma.
it sounded like you were talking about her love life.
no.
menopause.
we were talking about menopause.
yeah.yeah, you're right.
it's none of our business if ma's in menopause.
see ya.
you ready? - Yes.
we should... Get Maura and go.
Boston homicide.
what are you doing about Enzo?
what's your name?
how could you let this happen?
car washes are supposed to be safe!
uh, what was your relationship to him?
we went to college together.
I'm his office manager.
were you two involved?
in college.
we haven't slept together in years.
and where were you this morning?
delivering a wedding cake.
we'll need to verify that.
whatever.
I'm not about to kill my boss.
we'd like to talk to Laura Stephens.
everybody here was his friend.
we're working on a cake for his memorial service now.
they're making the Boston cambridge university football stadium.
Oh, look! It's a little Enzo.
and this is a representation of heaven.
and I think that that golden ladder is so he can ascend.
uh, Dr. Isles? The comparison test?
Oh, yes, of course.
damn, Enzo liked them in all shapes, sizes, and colors.
is that harassment?
possibly, yes.
you'll interfere with my process if you come any closer.
we'd like to talk to you about Enzo Womack.
can you just wait a sec?
crap, you made me bump the chin strap.
are these your knives?
don't touch them.
I'll need a clay impression for a comparison test.
I didn't kill him, all right?
a woman definitely killed that bastard, though.
how do you know a woman killed him?
you think you can do that over and over?
we found this photo you posted, Laura.
it was a joke.
it doesn't seem that funny to me.
me neither.
that looks pretty sharp.
it's a flower pin.
you should talk to everybody.
Enzo strung us all along.
"let's be friends,'kay?" no, not okay.
so, why'd you work for him?
do you know how hard it is to find a decent job in this economy?
I have a major in gender studies.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
well, it seems to me that Enzo gave you a reason to kill him, Laura.
he did, but I didn't.
I was at the gym. You can check. They take a picture when they swipe it.
I want it back.
I have to work out later today.
it's a shame that Laura has a solid alibi.
still, I think Enzo was playing a dangerous game.
you think, uh, too many notches on the bedpost got him killed?
maybe.
okay, Maura's finished testing all the knives.
our murder weapon is not at that bakery.
so, it's nice that Robin came with your mom, you know, so she could have some company.
my mom's really independent, but, yeah, I guess.
how do they know each other?
my mom's really independent, but, yeah, I guess.
how do they know each other?
my mom was in one of the first classes at the naval academy that allowed women.
are you kidding me?
she's amazing.
she and my dad were midshipmen together. That's how they met.
he had the career she should have.
and they're roommates, y-your mom and Robin?
after Robin's divorce, they decided to share expenses.
professors don't make that much.
well, it's good they have each other.
I mean to -- to share expenses.
no kidding. - Come on. Let's call it a day.
we got two games left in the season, and if we don't get in a practice today, the drug unit's gonna kick our ass.
since you put it that way...
sure. - yeah.
can't believe you weren't gonna tell us about practice.
Okay...look, there are only two more games left in the season, and -- and we'll be disqualified.
you're not part of homicide.
Oh, so Frost's mom is part of homicide?
Jane, we could buck up sides and have a scrimmage.
buck up? Who are you, opie?
who's opie? - Honey.
Maura, you...you don't have enough players for a team.
Oh, we'd be happy to play for Maura's team.
Yeah. Why not?
we're just a couple of old ladies looking for some exercise.
all right.
all right. So, you're gonna have to buck up, Jane.
I love to.
it's only fair that the winners buy the losers drinks.
Korsak got to take Cameron to buy an ice cream.
lab results, Dr. Isles.
thank you.
all the identifiable organic substances in the van were glucose-based confectioner's compounds.
swell. - And blood and glycerin from the soap.
double swell.
there was one exception.
the blue substance that you found on the rear floor mat is bulk field paint.
field paint?
BCU's colors are blue and... Susie, can you check and see if that field paint is from bcu?
Yeah, sure. - thank you.
Oh, just two old ladies in need of some exercise.
I think somebody lied.
it wasn't a lie.
we are old ladies.
and we needed exercise.
it was such an exciting game. 6-1.
we trounced you. - "we"?
Camille hit two home runs, and Robin hit a grand slam.
so 2 for you, 4 for you, and zero for you.
exactly. And is it a "we" when you got two ringers?
Oh, my god! You knew.
well, I figured Robin's swing had lost some power.
and mom -- You haven't played in a while.
we thought we were rustier than we were.
we scored one run -- one.
I think you played really well.
the drug unit's gonna destroy us.
well, not if you let us play.
and by "us," you mean Camille and Robin?
you're a very sore loser.
I did make it to the first base.
you don't say "the." - what?
you made it to first base because you were walked.
you know, walking's good.
to the walk. - To the walk.
walking.
why are you kicking my leg?
I s-should hand it to Robin and Camille.
Jane, did you hurt your neck? Are you having a muscle spasm?
Really?
I'd like to propose a toast.
that's great sportsmanship.
see? Toasting the winning team.
uh, to two wonderful people who have taught me the meaning of love and commitment
my mom...and her partner, Robin.
Barry, you knew?
Yeah, mom, I knew.
I had been agonizing over this for years.
you never brought it up.
it wasn't my business.
honey.
I figured if you wanted to tell me, you would.
I told you.
you've never given him enough credit.
I just wish I'd known.
how many times have I invited you to Massachusetts?
I kept hoping you'd make an honest woman out of her.
I'm glad you finally have.
thank you.
Congratulations.
Yes, congratulations. When is the wedding day?
we actually haven't even set the date yet.
it's -- it was just time to tell you, Barry.
I couldn't get married without you.
you'll be our best man?
you know I will.
Oh, and I have a great dress I haven't worn yet.
you haven't been invited.
listen, when we have our wedding, you'll all be welcome.
we'd love to have you join us.
all right, well, this calls for champagne.
losing team is buying.
hear, hear!
as long as winning team stops mocking.
sorry, sorry!
what are you doing here?
I wanted to apologize.
what did you do?
come inside.
I can't. - I'm so sorry.
we -- we can talk out here.
I don't mean I can't make it up your stairs.
I mean I don't want to go inside.
where are you going?
upstairs to hear your apology.
it might take me a while.
good. I have to put my glove away.
no.
okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay.
um, coming! Coming. Coming.
okay.
are you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine.
uh, come in.
um, sit down.
can -- can I get you a beer or... - Maybe a water.
a water. Okay. - Thanks.
I remember the last time I was here.
right before your last tour in Afghanistan.
my final tour.
it's like the last run on a ski slope.
you know as you're falling you shouldn't have taken it.
thank you for coming up.
I-I know you didn't want to.
I did. I ju-- I didn't want to be this close to you.
please. - I'm sorry.
I asked sergeant Korsak to look after Elsie because I'm having surgery.
surgery? W-when?
soon.
the stem-cell trials?- No. I'm not a candidate.
I found a neurosurgeon.
he thinks he can remove the, uh, shrapnel and bone shards from pressing against my spinal cord.
Casey, that's incredible.
there are no guarantees, and, uh...and there will be months of rehab.
but it's the first crack of light I've seen in a pretty dark tunnel.
well, let me -- let me help you.
I-I want to go through this with you.
that's exactly why I didn't get in touch.
Casey... I-it doesn't matter, okay?
I care about you.
okay, well, let's get to the middle.
I want to do this.
taking care of an invalid is an ugly form of intimacy.
there's no romance in it, Jane.
this injury isn't you. This is you.
I should have asked you not to go.
I should have asked you to wait.
did you see someone else while I was gone?
Yes.
did you care about him?
Yes.
then you'll find someone again.
what? No.
Casey, wait a minute.
wait. It's over with him.
it's -- it's been over.
look, I realized that when I saw you again how much I want this to work.
this won't work.
it will.
Casey, please, just give me a chance. Please.
do one thing for me.
anything.
let me kiss you... And then let me go.
Casey, please, please.
goodbye, Jane.
where do socks go?
all you need is a half-inch gap for them to slip under the agitator paddle.
so not sock heaven.
check your drawers.
static electricity causes them to stick to other clothing.
I hope Enzo gets to go to football heaven.
thank you for coming.
don't throw them away!
they don't have partners. They're making me sad.
okay. Tell me what he said.
he is having surgery to remove bone and shrapnel.
what? What's with the weird look?
it's nothing.
hives, Maura.
even white lies make you itch.
okay. Casey's condition is called cauda equine syndrome.
from what I've observed in him, it probably involves T-11 and -12 and maybe L-1.
same question -- why the weird look?
surgery on a partially impaired paraplegic is very risky.
well, you're not a neurosurgeon.
you're right.
I'm not.
so no guessing.
I just want to pretend like it's all gonna be fine. Can you do that with me?
I can try.
salute, Elsie.
good girl! Good salute, Elsie.
that wasn't a salute.
Yes, it was. - Looked like "shake" to me.
anybody want a bagel?
Yeah. Thanks.
all right, so, where are we?
we are nowhere.
we better get somewhere or Cavanaugh's gonna tear off some heads.
maybe I can help.
thanks to the team-building softball game, the crime lab stayed up all night to get these results to you.
I thought they were helping us solve murders because
Oh, I don't know -- it's their job.
the blue paint on the floor mat is consistent with the paint used for the bcu field stencils.
that's right where the killer would have been.
frost, you said that Enzo had season tickets. Was he at saturday's game?
no. His ticket wasn't used, so I followed up with his office manager.
Enzo had to work on a wedding cake.
it was the first game of the season, which means Enzo didn't transfer that field paint inside his van.
maybe our murder did.
I didn't mean anything when I looked at it, but watch this.
Enzo was watching this clip from saturday's game.
what kind of call is that?
coach Phillips? What do we know about him?
Jane, what would be the motive? Enzo hadn't played for him for five years.
phillips was a contender for a division I coaching gig.
it went away after bcu lost that season five years ago.
am I disappointed? Yeah, yeah, I'm disappointed.
coaching a division I team is a dream of mine.
but, uh, bcu -- we had a great run there till Enzo hurt himself.
sounds like Phillips blames Enzo.
well, that blue paint only tells us that our killer was on that field.
frost, you get the phone working yet?
no. Got to put the battery back in.
okay, I want to see what else Enzo was watching the night before he was killed.
his laptop is in bric. - Okay.
sergeant Korsak, did Casey tell you why he need you to take Elsie?
no. He just said she might need a home for a few months.
he mentioned something I didn't want Jane to hear.
what was that?
he made me promise I would take care of Elsie if anything happened to him.
Hey, you guys coming? - Yep.
okay. We got one shot at this.
if there's any moisture, the circuits will fry themselves.
turn it on.
do I have witnesses?
sergeant detective Korsak is telling me to turn this phone on.
turn the damn phone on, Frost.
I want it in writing that this one is not on me if this phone...
it's dead. So much for your rice idea.
this is the whole list of video files Enzo was watching.
can you play that one?
BCU going for the money with a hand-off to end zone.
look at Womack as he breaks to the strong side and -- oh, no!
he's not getting up.
folks, this does not look good.
why was Enzo watching that?
you see the right guard?
Yeah. - Yeah.
I didn't. What are you talking about?
let's see that again.
the normally sure-footed right guard looks like he slips on the turf.
and there goes hard-charging Der'on Martin flying in at full speed.
Enzo is down!
Ouch!
frost, play that clip from Saturday's game.
Marcus to the right on a hand-off.
how did that happen?
looks like bcu's right guard lost his footing and left running back Jeff Marcus unprotected for that nasty hit.
Ouch!
it reminds me of that hit that ended Enzo Womack's career five years ago.
I think we just figured out what got Enzo killed.
that was a nasty hit.
what?
what did -- what did you see?
I'd like to know what got Enzo killed.
both bcu right guards, who played five years apart, faked the same trip on the same play.
to make sure their running back got tackled and didn't score.
this is like the day I took that A. P. Calculus exam.
you know, I couldn't have solved that inverse derivative problem if my life depended on it.
calm down. Calm down, okay?
for once, I get to explain something to you.
frost, can you freeze both bad plays?
that right guard and at least one other player -- probably the quarterback -- fixed that game in 2007.
okay, and that right guard fixed the same play five years later.
are you saying bcu players from two separate seasons threw games?
altered games.
it's too easy to get caught if you throw them.
if you just shave points... Frost, can we see both quarterbacks?
Yeah, right there.
both quarterbacks made identical signals.
that says to me,"we're throwing the play.
watch their eyes right before they tap their helmets.
Yeah, you're right.
we have a shot caller -- who are they looking at?
frost, do you have any other angles?
so, Enzo must have realized the trip that ended his career wasn't accidental.
but why would the right guard fake a trip?
Enzo was his teammate.
the players who were cheating weren't trying to hurt him.
they were just trying to keep him from scoring.
to change the over/under.
that's what this is about.
of course.
what? Over/under what?
Over/under is a type of bet.
oddsmakers announce a number before a game.
it's their best guess of what the final combined score will be.
and I can bet over or under that number.
Yes. - Okay, I think I understand.
so if the teams' scores, when added together, are lower than predicted, I win.
Yes. And if you know that there are dirty players that are fixing the game to keep the score down, you bet on the under, and then you win big.
Yeah, but why would a college player cheat, especially at a prestigious academic university?
well, bcu is a division iii football program.
there's no money, no scholarships.
they're having a car-wash fundraiser to buy equipment.
coach Phillips is the shot caller.
I don't think so. Play it again.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, play both the 2007 game and saturday's game.
watch Mackenzie.
you see that?
he dropped the towel both times.
uh, the results are back on the substance found in Enzo's wounds.
it's analgesic heat rub.
and the fibers I found were from cotton sports tape.
Maura... You said the murder weapon had a hilt?
could it be a multipurpose tool, like this one?
Yes.
is that Enzo's phone?
okay, you don't get credit for fixing it.
give it to me. - No.
I can look at cellphones, too.
give it to me and let me plug it in.
thank you.
here's his last text message.
to Dan Mackenzie, 7:54 A. M. - right before he went to the car wash.
he thought his coach was dirty.
I hope I'm crazy.
we didn't want to accuse the program he loved unless he was sure he was right.
so he went to the person he trusted the most
his former teammate Dan Mackenzie.
it shouldn't be so swollen.
how many times I got to tell you to ice this sucker, huh?
Hey, you can't be in here. There's no women allowed.
BCU just made an exception.
well, what's this about?
we checked your stats, Dan.
you were a good field-goal kicker.
but suddenly, you started missing.
was that when it started?
when what started?
you were missing kicks to shave points.
I don't know what you guys are talking about.
we're talking about basic greed.
living pretty large for a guy making $40, 000 as a d-iii athletic trainer.
I want a lawyer.
you came up with this scheme in college, but you knew Enzo wouldn't cheat 'cause he was a good guy.
and he was going to the pros. You weren't.
he -- he -- he was accusing the team of cheating.
he was gonna give the bcu program a bad name.
Enzo sent you a text before you killed him.
he thought coach Phillips was corrupting the players.
it never occurred to him it was his friend.
you're under arrest for the murder of Enzo Womack.
what are you doing here?
I know you wanted me to pretend that everything will be fine.
what's that?
it's some research I did on decompressive lumbar spine surgery.
I don't want to know.
Jane, you need to know.
Why?
I mean, he said goodbye, Maura, so...
Jane, if you care about him, you'll look.
how bad is it?
bad.
what am I gonna do?
I wish I knew.
chicken pox? - No.
Chlamydia?
Really? - I'll take that as a "no."
deep vein thrombosis? - No.
how about depression?
only since you started asking me all these questions.
let me remind you that if you'd gone to your regular O. B. ,
we wouldn't have to fill out new-patient forms.
well, let me remind you my regular O. B. is two blocks from the house I grew up in.
the staff knows people in my neighborhood, and people talk.
I don't want Casey's mom finding out about this pregnancy before I have a chance to tell him.
are you having second thoughts about not marrying Casey?
no.
I mean, I love Casey, and I know that he loves me.
but we decided that marriage isn't right for us now.
are you worried he won't understand?
Yeah.
I don't want to hurt him. You just need to talk to him and speak from the heart.
Yeah.
well, until I get it figured out,
the only person that I trust knowing about this pregnancy is you.
you and this complete stranger who will now be my O. B.-gyn.
uh, I ...
otherwise, I just ... I just want to keep it a secret.
your mom knows you're pregnant. I'll wait in the car.
I didn't actually tell your mother.
she somehow knew, and then I confirmed it. I don't really even know how it happened.
I am so sorry. - She use the Latin thing on you?
Yeah, that's it.
and then did she tell you about her psychic grandmother and take your hand and say that she could tell if you were lying just by running her fingers across your palm?
but it felt so real and honest. Her grandmother died when she was 5.
I'm such an idiot! - No, no.
you just fell for her well-oiled routine.
I mean, Frankie couldn't get away with anything as a kid because she was always weaseling a confession out of him.
sounds like a cop I know.
was that a veiled reference to my potential parenting style?
I wouldn't call it "veiled."
all right, well, let me handle this.
I don't want her to make it about you.
don't let her use the Latin on you.
what? Is there something you want to ask me about?
Why? No, no. Is there something you want to tell me?
what is it you think I know?
you tell me. - I don't know.
ma, I know you know. I spoke to Maura.
thank you for finally telling me!
I'm so happy for you, Jane. I am so proud of you!
thank you. - So, what about you and Casey?
we've already made a decision about our relationship, okay?
Jane, you have to have ... - Ma, this baby is my responsibility, okay?
don't push the Casey thing.
okay, fine.
and don't tell anybody. - Me?
I'm serious, Ma, okay?
if the department finds out that I'm pregnant, I could be reassigned to desk duty.
okay, what's so bad about a desk job?
I like being a cop. - You're about to be a mother, too.
today, I'm still just a cop.
you know, that's not exactly all-terrain footwear.
maybe we should have sacrificed fashion for comfort.
I'm getting my field boots resoled. I'm fine.
Yeah, "fine" and wincing don't exactly go together.
well, my feet only hurt because I'm taking a new yoga class to strengthen them.
but I'm in a transition period, and soon, I'll be able to wear any size heel anywhere.
lady Gaga will be so proud of you.
what do we got?
park worker found him this morning around 8: 00.
witnesses? - No.
there are two wounds,
one to the ear with significant tissue loss and an entrance wound to the chest.
so through and through? -No.
I feel it is likely a projectile in the subcutaneous tissue.
shot alert picked up two shots ... 10: 58, 10: 59 last night.
well, given the stage of rigor mortis, that fits the window for the time of death.
I got Frankie setting up a line search.
anything else? - I've got footprints heading up the hill.
Yeah, two sets. - And we have blood drops.
okay, so... He was shot and then took off running with someone chasing him.
.30-30. - And where's the other shell casing?
who leaves a murder weapon where we can find it?
somebody who thinks it doesn't matter. I'll get CSRU to process it.
what the hell was going on up here last night? Well, the victim didn't have a wallet.
it's a lot of work to steal a wallet.
maybe it was a sex crime, drug deal gone wrong, random shooting.
so, outside of an attack by aliens, you're not willing to rule anything out?
I won't even rule out the little green men. They're a slippery bunch.
you're gonna want to see what we found.
you okay?
since when do I need help walking through the woods?
can't a brother just give his sister a hand? Yeah, if he wants to lose it.
does that look like a fresh grave to you? Yep.
well, I guess we can scratch one thing off your list. This wasn't random.
got a hit on the victim's fingerprints.
he was in the army reserve back in the '90s.
Carl Ulrich, 37.
our victim was a steelworker, but he lost his job six years ago.
no vehicle registration, no credit cards, no phone listing.
his last known address is five years old. Criminal record?
this guy didn't even have a parking ticket.
well, he only died yesterday, so he's been somewhere, doing something.
let's figure out what that was. All right.
someone didn't want you finding this serial number. You changed the oil.
I was working on an art project, and that's all I could find at the hardware store.
it actually mixes better with the metal particles than what we were using before.
art project?
I etched the bust and skyline on a salvaged piece of flatiron.
then I filed it off.
we're ready. You can attach the magnets.
everyone thought I was trying to make some statement on disposability, but when the tiny metal particles started to fill in the imperceptible grooves...
which was a statement on... ? - I just thought it was cool.
I didn't know you were an artist.
before medical school, I studied art in Paris for a year.
so, tell me something that'll surprise me about Sergeant Detective Vince Korsak.
I cut an album before I was a cop. Look at that.
a riddle wrapped inside of an enigma.
they're massaging my feet.
I have a simpler fix ... stop wearing high heels.
like I said, it's not from the heels. This is part of my new strengthening regime.
I e-mailed my yoga teacher about my metatarsal discomfort, and she suggested knobby balls.
not even gonna go there.
it's a spin on the ancient Chinese practice of walking on cobblestones.
the balls ... they connect with the pressure points on my feet, which correspond to major organs.
you should think about some elements of Chinese medicine now that you're... pregnant.
thought about it. No.
well, at least you're keeping an open mind. What do we know about ballistics?
the bullet that I removed from our victim was a . 22 caliber.
we found a . 30-30 rifle at the crime scene.
Yeah, and our victim nearly got his ear shot off by a large-caliber bullet consistent with the rifle you recovered, but the fatal shot came from a . 22.
it entered his chest at the second intercostal and nicked his subclavian artery.
how long would it have taken him to bleed out?
the elevated heart rate from adrenaline and physical exertion resulted in massive internal bleeding. It happened very quickly.
so... He ran himself to death?
in a manner of speaking, yes.
also, while his jeans and shirt were worn and frayed, they were also clean and ironed.
and the even growth of his hair indicates a recent haircut, and the work boots he was wearing were new.
so wherever he was going, he dressed himself up a bit. What's that about?
my life coach always stresses the importance of dressing for success. - Usually, that's good advice.
Susie raised the serial number on the rifle.
we also realized it was jammed, which is probably why the killer dropped it.
and the chase is why the victim wasn't buried as planned.
let's run the serial number through NCIC.
did he say "life coach"? - Don't ask.
I found someone who worked with Ulrich six years ago.
he said he was a good guy but kept to himself.
did he know what he'd been doing since he lost his job?
someone on the plant floor said that they saw him go into a soup kitchen near the steelyard awhile back.
word was he lost his house and was living out of a storage unit.
did you check it out? - The unit was empty.
manager said he'd cleaned it out two days ago.
I also went to the soup kitchen. Minister told me that he'd been in there last week.
he was upbeat because he just landed a new job.
where? - Minister didn't know.
can I get you a cup of coffee? - Yeah, sure.
have a seat.
Thanks. - Uh, decaf, right?
Frankie. - Yeah?
is there something you'd like to tell me?
Yes. It's been killing me.
Congratulations.
now I can stop being nice to you for no reason.
Oh, yeah. I wouldn't want you to develop any bad habits.
how'd you find out? - Ma.
hello. - Ma!
you promised me that you wouldn't say anything to anybody.
Jane, Frankie isn't anybody. He's your brother.
telling anybody would be like blabbing it to a perfect stranger.
Hey, you, did you hear me say anything about my daughter being pregnant?
see? - You have no idea what he just said.
no, but did you hear him say anything about... a baby?
how do you argue with that?
I'm warning you ... one word gets out about this, and I'm gonna name the baby after Constantina.
you are never to speak her name. Who's Constantina?
her cousin. - El Diablo!
why, you. You wouldn't dare. - Boy or girl...
Constantina Rizzoli.
and now... I go to lunch.
have Ma fill you in on old cousin Consty.
Hey. - We got a hit on the rifle.
it belongs to John Brooks, a 39-year-old white male with a record of drunk and disorderly conduct and assault.
we have a current address? - Yeah, D street in Southie.
I guess lunch will have to wait. Guess again.
that's the best reuben I've ever had. - Also is with the meat.
o' Malley's cures their own corned beef.
why do they call it corned beef?
I mean, what's corn got to do with it?
that's John Brooks' car. - And that looks like our guy.
I got him.
Boston police. - What the hell's going on?!
are you John Brooks? - No. I'm Ralph Comstock.
that's what his license says. Why are you driving Brooks' car?
we were roommates. I bought it from him.
I just, uh, haven't gotten around to re-registering it.
where is he? - John? I don't have any idea.
that's why I called you guys a year ago. That's when he went missing.
I'm telling you, John's no killer. Then how did his rifle end up at a murder scene?
I...I don't know. But I know John.
we ... we've been best friends since we were kids.
we grew up in Southie, played Mighty Mites baseball together.
well, then, you know about his criminal record. He's not exactly an altar boy.
sure, but that was because of his drinking. He cleaned up his act way before he went missing.
so, what happened a year ago?
John got a new job. He was gonna be a caretaker on a farm.
who was he working for? - I don't know.
where was the farm? - I'm not sure.
Ah, come on. You got to do better than that. I wish I could.
all I know is he answered an ad on the internet.
he interviewed, got the job, packed up all of his stuff... his clothes, his tools.
his rifle? - Everything.
he even took our Mighty Mites baseball trophy.
said it would remind him of the good times.
if he applied for a job online, whose computer did he use? We shared an old laptop.
did he take it with him, or do you still have it? I have it.
I spilled coffee on the keys. It fritzed up.
we're gonna need to see that. Sure. It's in the closet of my apartment.
what else can you tell us about John?
he loves dogs, pizza...
Hmm... he's diabetic.
look, I know he made some bad choices, but I'm telling you, John Brooks was a good guy.
whatever you think he did, you're wrong.
both these guys are similar. Both grew up in Southie, both out of work.
both down on their luck when they find a new job. And then, one's dead and the other goes missing.
when did Ralph say that Brooks went missing?
march 23rd, last year.
shot alert recorded a single gunshot near Blackstone Park.
unit responded but didn't find anything. It's a big park.
I'll organize a team to search it tomorrow. Alright. I guess that means we're done for the day.
well, there is... one other thing we have to talk about.
what's this?
it's a file with the names and the service records of potential replacements for Frost.
what? - Brass gave it to me this morning.
it's ... it's too soon to talk about this. Nobody's saying we have to bring someone in right away.
we can't replace him, Vince. He's irreplaceable.
I know. I know. I know.
but... I've got orders to begin the process, and ...
I wanted you to have some say in it.
I'll go organize the search for tomorrow.
I can't believe that they want to replace him already.
I just think they don't want your job to be any harder than it already is.
Yeah, but replacing Frost isn't gonna help that. No, but a bureaucracy can't know that.
I just miss him so much. - I know.
you know, I'm sorry. I don't mean to dump this on you.
I know you're sad, too. - It's okay.
what's going on? - Well, uh, we were gonna go to dinner and wanted to know if you wanted to join us.
ma told you I was back in A. A?
Yeah. I'm really proud of you.
that the only reason you came by?
and I figured she told you I was pregnant.
my big sister's gonna have a baby! - It's so exciting.
Yeah. "Exciting." - Oh, the first thing we got to get you is the tough love carrier.
it's waterproof, which is key, 'cause little ones are pooping and peeing machines.
no, what I need is ... is for you to keep this quiet.
Yeah, absolutely. No problem. Totally get it.
thank you. Hey, everyone, this is Jane.
Oh! Congratulations on the baby.
Thanks. - Bye, Judy.
is there anyone in Boston you haven't told?
don't worry. Everything in A. A. is confidential.
let's get something to eat.
Yes. Let's. - Yes.
so, did you have any trouble with the collapsible triggers on the jogging stroller?
Oh, instructions on all baby gear is impossible.
you just got to take your time and have a good Swedish dictionary handy.
Oh, really? - Yeah.
I don't know any Swedish. - Me neither.
what's the word? - Corrupted.
the hard drive is fried.
all we've been able to retrieve is a photo of a farm that we think was connected to an ad for the job.
trouble is, we don't know if Brooks created the ad. He could have just been answering it.
all right, well, let's analyze the photo, see if we can locate the farm.
maybe that'll help us I. D. the killer. Oh, my god!
is that what you call a breakfast?
no ... not without coffee. - May I please see the package?
do you know what's in here? - Yummy goodness?
calcium carbonate. Does that sound yummy?
it comes from rocks. Oh!
sodium stearate ... that's used in soap.
and do you know where you can find titanium dioxide?
right there. Latex paint.
do industrial chemicals sound like a good thing to be putting in your body? - Not anymore.
Hey, Korsak. Buzzkill.
well, she's right here. Okay, we'll be right there.
I am not a buzzkill.
Nutrition's more important now than ever.
the first trimester is the most critical in terms of the development of the organs, the nervous system, the arms, the fingers, legs, toes.
I was...I was just eating a cupcake. I didn't mean it as a hostile act.
can you tell how long he's been in the ground? I can't be certain until I examine the remains.
Maura, "approximately" isn't gonna hurt you. Science is not a guessing game.
you want me to get another cupcake?
a year or more is likely. - What's that by his wrist?
diabetes bracelet.
well, now we know John Brooks didn't go missing.
all this poor guy wanted was a job. This is what he got instead.
Hey. Anything new?
no. We searched the hell out of the internet.
we found an ad with the same farm photo on two other websites.
did you I. D. who placed the ad? Guy used a fake name and paid for his bill with Bitcoins.
looks like the ad's a dead end. - Well, the photo isn't.
Susie identified those as fraxinus quadrangus.
English? - The trees ... blue ash.
they're found almost exclusively in Western Ohio.
did you get an address? No.
but we found a highway number ... Route 422.
runs East/West. - I'm guessing through Western Ohio.
Yeah.
this landmass matches something called Campbell Hill. Which I bet is also in Western Ohio.
this storage facility has been there for 15 years.
well, if the farm no longer exists, the ad is a fake.
just a way to lure out men looking for work in order to kill them.
we found that ad in multiple places, which could mean the killer has attempted this several times.
I'll run the profile through NCIC for similar crimes.
I'll dig into the farm. Maybe our killer is connected to it.
let's hope so. Might be the only way we have to find him.
dental records confirmed ... This is John Brooks.
single gunshot wound through the occipital region with a large-caliber bullet.
like one from the gun we found at the first crime scene?
certainly possible.
I don't know if "irony" is the right word for getting killed with your own gun.
what can I do for you, sergeant?
I ran an NCIC search on unsolved murders that match our victims ...
urban areas, unemployed men between the ages of 25 and 40.
well, I suspect that yielded a plethora of hits. I'll be retired before I get through them all.
I was hoping maybe you could help me narrow my search. We only have two data points.
well, do the best you can.
the killer is taking the victims away from where they live.
he's stealing their wallets, their identities, and burying them ...
not only, I suspect, to ensure that he gets away with the crimes, but also to make them anonymous. Okay.
I'm not a psychiatrist, so it wouldn't be ethical for me to make a clinical diagnosis.
but hypothetically, I'd say...
he's a malignant narcissist ... Unable to empathize, only investing emotionally in things he can control.
like our victims' destinies. - Yes.
and to him, these victims are worthless, as he himself feels.
he strips them of everything. - Even the dignity for their loved ones to know that they're dead.
I would do a search and include John Does whose bodies have never been claimed by family.
Thanks, doc.
I knew there was a reason I come down here. Anytime, sergeant.
the only trace evidence we found on Brooks' remains is a single, long, gray hair.
well, that obviously didn't come from the victim.
no, but if it came from the killer, that would make him a middle-aged male with long, gray hair.
thanks for going out on a limb. Well, a Llama seemed unlikely.
is everything okay? - Yeah.
no. - Want to talk about it?
I just ... I feel like I finally got everything settled with Casey you, know, about our lives, our ... our marriage.
you did. - Right.
but now that I'm pregnant with his child, it just makes it so much more complicated.
I know. I mean, even the way I tell him seems difficult.
do I e-mail him or ... or call or Skype?
and how is he gonna react when I tell him that I intend on raising this child without him?
is he gonna be mad? Is he gonna be hurt?
is ... is he gonna fight me?
is he gonna come running back? - You know, it's overwhelming.
but, uh, you don't have to rush it. You know, you can talk to him when you're ready.
Yeah. Except that he contacted me...
and he wants to talk ... tonight.
Hey. - I reran the NCIC search and found several murders that fit our profile.
they go from Columbus to Pittsburgh to Boston.
there's a direct line from that farm in Ohio to our backyard.
what's the most recent case?
the unsolved murder of a 31-year-old, unemployed man.
his body was found in the woods near a rest stop 18 months ago.
let me guess ... Shot in the back of the head. Yep. And get this.
he left a message for his landlord the day before he disappeared saying that he just landed a great job at a farm.
what about his belongings?
all his stuff, including his 2004 green Ford pickup, still missing.
what if these crimes are just old-fashioned robbery/homicides?
none of these guys are that well off.
but their stuff can be easily liquidated ... I mean, tools, guns, trucks.
what's a 2004 Ford pickup truck go for these days?
10, 11 grand. Well, that's a lot more than you get in a bank robbery.
and the killer is anonymous to everyone except the person he's pretending to hire.
Mm-hmm. And that person has no connections.
you know what? Maybe it's time we applied for a new job.
we should answer that internet ad. Yes. I will, uh, pick a job application.
Oh, I got it. Why don't you call it a day?
what are you talking about? - I'll do the application.
I've got something else to do here tonight. I was gonna stay anyway.
go. Get some rest.
okay. Uh...
okay.
I'll, uh... I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm a 32-year-old, single, former construction worker looking for a new lease on life.
blah, blah, blah.
mechanically inclined... Have my own tools.
great. I also thought I would add that my father recently passed away and I have no other relations.
I suspect that would be very appealing to our killer.
what? No heels? - Cramps.
long story. But don't tell Jane.
is everything okay with her? - Why?
well, I mean, I know she's taken Frost's death hard, but it seems like there's something else bothering her.
you're a very nice man. - Is there anything I can do?
I think you're doing it already.
Hey, Maura.
Yes, I-I took your advice, and I wrote down notes to direct the conversation in a focused way.
Really? Okay, fine. I'll read them to you.
okay. Baby ... yes.ÔºàÔºüÔºüÔºü)
us married... still no.
raising child... just me.
his role ... uh... I don't know.
something about understanding and arm wrestling.
I'm kidding.
Yeah, no, no. It's ... it's gonna go great, don't you think?
okay, um... Maura, I got to go.
this is him.
okay. I hope so, too. Thanks.
Hey, Casey.
so? How'd it go with Casey? - Fine.
can you be a little bit more specific than "fine"?
I mean, what can I tell you?
it ... it ... it went fine.
okay. How did he react when you told him you were pregnant?
he was surprised. Um... but he understood that. That's not a reason to get married, so...
and what about your plans to raise a child on your own?
we're gonna figure out his level of involvement once he's had a chance to digest all the information.
well, that sounds like it went better than "fine."
I don't know what more you could ask for. Yeah. No, you're right. You're right.
so, why aren't you more relieved?
because when I was finished dealing with Casey, the thought of having a baby just hit me like a freight train.
I'm ... I'm scared, Maura.
of course you're scared. That's how you're supposed to feel.
there's the support I was looking for.
okay, nothing about giving birth or raising children is easy.
you and your brothers caused me a whole bunch of trouble.
but I wouldn't trade it for a minute!
because you've been my greatest joy!
and your child will do the same for you.
fear is normal. Keeps us on our toes.
Thanks, Ma.
what kind of problems could I have possibly caused you? Don't get me started.
Oh, please ... start.
she threw a football through Mr. Mac's front window.
that was Tommy. - You made him.
she didn't come home on prom night.
well, that was a misunderstanding. - Okay.
she duct-taped Frankie to a chair for laughs. - That was funny.
that poor boy still jumps every time he hears that "chkkkk!" sound.
you were bad, Jane. She was bad.
I've been waiting for you. Did you get a reply to my job application?
we got an automated response that the job had been filled.
then why are you smiling? - Because I started thinking ...
if we got an automated response, maybe the other guys who applied got the same thing.
I like where this is going.
so I contacted the website and got the e-mail addresses of the other men who received the same automated response.
you think one of them may have interacted with the killer? One actually met for the job.
and he's waiting in the interview room right now. Early bird, meet worm.
I answered the ad and, uh, got a reply from this guy ... Greg.
we met at a diner for the interview. - Did you get his last name?
no. - What can you tell us about him?
seemed like a good guy. We both liked bikes ... bonded over Harleys.
what kind of Harley you got? - '77 Electra Glide.
1, 200cc shovelhead. Nice ride.
I bet Greg liked the bike. - Oh, yeah. Yeah.
and he was impressed, too, you know, that even through all the hard times,
I found a way to hang on to it. Well, sounds like you two really hit it off.
we did. - Well, why didn't you get the job?
he, uh, he got pissed when he found out I had a girlfriend.
I hadn't mentioned that on the application. What did Greg look like?
white guy, mid-50s, big ... Maybe 6'5," long, gray hair pulled back in a ponytail.
where did you meet him? Bayview diner in Southie.
Frankie's looking for us. - Okay.
thank you very much, Steve. So, what did this guy do?
well, let's just say you're lucky this is the one job you didn't get.
I sent the photo to the local sheriff where the farm was located.
he remembers the family that owned the place, the Danielsons.
according to bankruptcy records, the dad, Harry, lost it to the bank in 1984.
you think Harry's our killer? - No. He's deceased.
but his son, Greg, might be. - Korsak: Description matches.
and Greg seems to have dropped off the radar in the late '90s.
that's about the time the murders began.
Yeah. - Jane, you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah. It's never too early for lunch.
Yeah, I've seen him. But he's older now.
his hair is gray. It's in one of them damn ponytails.
looks ridiculous on an old guy like him. I know what you mean.
you won't catch me growing mine out. - Hm. Is he a regular?
no. He comes in from time to time.
when's the last time you saw him? - I don't know. Couple days ago.
was he with this man? - Yeah. They went out of here laughing.
can you remember anything else about him? Like, does he ever talk about where he lives?
no. - What about a car?
I saw him getting into an old, green pickup across the street.
now, unless you're ordering the daily special, I got to get back to my paying customers.
the victim 18 months ago owned a 2004 green Ford pickup that's been missing since the murder.
let's put a BOLO out on that and let them know the driver's armed and dangerous.
anything on the BOLO? - Nothing.
all right, well, I set up surveillance on the diner and every large park in the city.
there's something else I got to tell you.
uh... I'm, um...
I-I'm ... I'm pregnant.
Congratulations. - Thank you.
only Maura and my family know, so...
well, thank you for including me. - Well, you're family, Vince.
and ... and I want to keep it a secret until I... can't keep it a secret.
I mean, Brass finds out, I'll be riding ... - We got a hit on our BOLO.
a patrol officer pulled over a green 2004 Ford pickup. We got our guy.
over there.
which way did he go? Okay. Get him an ambulance.
spread out. - What happened?
I hit the lights. The guy pulls over, bolts from the truck.
I chased him before I realized he had a gun. You're gonna be okay.
I've got an officer down. Send me an ambulance ASAP.
he's dead. Jane?
Hey! Hey, look at me. You okay?
okay. Come on.
all right. Okay, okay.
get up. Come on, come on.
come on. Come on. Get up. Come on. Get up.
all right, all right. You're okay. Breathe.
breathe for me.
that's it. Okay.
you okay, you okay? - Thank you.
come here, come here. All right.
I mean, none of this stuff is worth killing over.
losing the family farm clearly screwed him up.
maybe he felt he was owed something because of it.
Yeah, or he was just an asshole. - Certainly more concise.
it was because of your friendship we were able to find his murderer.
Danielson would have killed again. You saved lives.
I just wish I could have saved Brooks.
I told him he didn't have to take that job. I don't know why he wouldn't let me help him.
everybody needs help sometimes.
how are you doing with the shooting?
I'm okay. I mean, he made his decision.
I had no choice. I just reacted.
that's a very healthy attitude. - I'm all about the healthy choices.
so, is that why you decided to join me tonight? Well, you said it'd be good for me.
as simple as that?
all right, well, you are going to love it here.
it's very peaceful, and the staff is very friendly.
remind me again why it's so good for me.
well, as your pregnancy advances and you gain more and more weight, there's an increased strain on your legs and your feet.
sounds lovely. - You'll be fine.
this class is all about building up the muscles that you'll need to handle your new body.
Jane, those are someone else's shoes.
my feet are clean.
Ooh. They do look fabulous on you.
What?!
not bad for a pregnant lady, hmm?
Jane, why are you really here?
because I realized I have to let you help me with this baby.
Wow. It's not easy for you to ask for help.
I can't do this alone, Maura.
nobody can. It takes a village.
and your family and me ... We are happy to be your village.
are those yours? - Uh... no.
then what do you think you're doing?
admiring them?
Yeah, this isn't a shoe store. They don't belong to you.
she was just... - Trying on other people's shoes.
who does that?
I'll just take them off. - Yes, you will.
and you'll wait right here while I go speak to an instructor.
Oh, you're right. The staff is "so friendly."
I am suddenly not feeling like taking a class tonight.
Oh, good. Well, why don't I take my village out for a burger?
Oh. You know what? This villager thinks that's an excellent idea.
just hurry.
you know, burgers can be a little fatty.
okay, fine. I'll have the turkey burger.
you know, a quinoa burger actually isn't a bad choice. Don't push it, Maura.
maybe you should have a... Toe burger with your new shoes.
I can't believe I did that.
w-why didn't you stand up and stop me or something?
she scared me. - Okay, ready?
1, 2, 3. Kick!
okay! Harder! Harder! Don't stop!
don't ever stop! Keep going!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
this ain't some fancy workout, girls, and it sure ain't jog.
my workout will get you in shape. You'll become a fighting machine.
you work out with me, and I'l turn you into one tough broad.
we're doing it all here. Come on. Work out.
see her form? See what she's doing? Yes! Yes!
you are one tough broad!
enough already.
you're only gonna be gone for three days.
you're pregnant. You're vitamin-ing for two.
do we need to revisit the pictures of the iron-deficient spleen?
I'm so excited for your medical examiner's convention.
is there anything I can do that will help you get out the door?
take your pyridoxine. - Is it the one that looks like Fred Flintstone or Barney Rubble?
I'm gonna miss you. - I'm gonna miss you, too.
Mwah! But I'm excited I'm gonna get to spend some one-on-one time with Jane.
so, there will be a temporary fill-in M. E.
and Susie will be available at the crime lab. And, of course, I'm always available by phone.
day or night. - Everything is gonna be fine.
Yeah, but, I mean, I don't know. What if something goes wrong with the house?
or we have another big case? Maybe I should just stay.
I thought you were really looking forward to this. I was.
but ... ?
Graywoods casino.
food by Wolfgang Puck. - Oh.
table magic by David Blaine. - What?
sounds incredibly awesome.
I know. Way better than my convention.
what? The one you hosted? It was a big hit.
Yeah, but it just wasn't ... fun.
well, medical-examiner conventions aren't supposed to be fun.
that's not the point. They're supposed to be educational.
andrea Bocelli. Double hubba-hubba.
I'm marrying you off before Maura gets back. Good luck.
Rizzoli. - Isles. Yes. I'll be right out.
okay. I'm on my way.
cab. - Homicide.
maybe I should stay. - Go to the convention. Save a life.
okay, we're walking. We're moving. We're going.
see. You're having fun already.
sergeant Korsak. - Morning, Jenkins.
guy just left this for you. Bobby Symanski.
Korsak. I'll be right there.
Hey. - Hey. The temp M. E. is on his way.
deceased is Judith Barnett, 40.
multiple stab wounds on her back. Weapon?
two round blood smears on either side of her, - so the killer was kneeling over her. - No sign of forced entry.
neighbor saw a white truck gunning away from the curb.
license plate? - No. And no description of the driver.
neighbor saw the open door, came in, found the body, called 911.
what about relatives? The victim's husband, Alan, is a dentist.
he's been with a patient, in surgery. Here's the address.
all right. Let us know what you turn up.
we'll go talk to Alan.
Dr. Barnett should be finished any moment.
are you sure I can't help you, detectives? Uh, no, thank you.
we really do need to speak to Dr. Barnett.
here you go, sweetie. Thanks.
see you tomorrow. Oh, here he is.
you have someone coming to pick you up, right?
my son ... Sam. - Excellent.
very good driver, Sam.
I'm sure. Good to see you, Marion.
Dr. Barnett. These detectives from the Boston police would like to speak with you.
Oh. Really? Why?
what time did you leave the house this morning?
6: 15. Judith was asleep.
I met Mrs. Gold here at 6: 30.
and your receptionist can confirm that? - What?
no. She comes in at 8: 00.
I was alone with Mrs. Gold for the gum graft.
she needs extra attention.
I told Judith that something like this might happened.
what do you mean? - Judith was big all her life ...
as a girl, when I met her, when we got married.
and I loved her. Just the way she was.
but she didn't love herself. She tried dieting. Never worked.
then, a year ago, she found Tough Broad.
the workout. - She lost a hundred pounds.
and I was really worried for her. - Could explain that for us?
she was a grown woman who'd never learned how to deal with men's advances because no one was ever interested.
most woman develop some kind of defenses as teenagers.
Judith was getting a lot of attention from men. She didn't know how to handle it.
excuse me.
Frankie. Was there a specific man giving your wife attention?
no, but ...
guys were starting conversations with her in the supermarket.
waiters were fawning over her. The mailman hung around to chat.
okay. Thanks.
did that bother you? - Me? No.
I was proud.
I was the guy with this amazing wife.
was Judith expecting anyone at your house this morning?
our handyman. He's been putting in new insulation.
and what is his name? - Luis Benitez.
we'll be in touch, Dr. Barnett.
we are very sorry for your loss.
what's up? - That call from Frankie.
they found the knife used to stab Judith.
it's got the initials "L. B." carved into the handle.
let's have some uniforms bring Luis Benitez in for a chat.
let's.
he's got a long rap sheet.
multiple arrests for breaking and entering. Multiple incidents of assault with a deadly weapon.
wild guess on the weapon ... a knife? - Wild and correct.
Korsak. He did so much work for the Barnetts, they set up an account for him at Factory Hill Hardware.
he bought locks a month ago. So he'd have a key.
could this get any easier?
when the uniforms went to pick up Luis, he was gone.
his mother said he went out of town ... took some clothes, left in a hurry.
so our guy's not ready to jump into cuffs just yet.
what's up, Chang? - Jane!
uh, Dr. Crosby gave me the initial findings from the crime scene.
well, why didn't he give them to me?
Oh, there's a reason why he works in a one-man office in Maine.
Anyhoo ... these are Judith's wounds.
the length and the shape of the knife found at the scene match the wound pattern.
the edges were serrated, which is why ribs were broken and bone was sawed off.
what about the blood on the knife? - Matches the victim.
no fibers or hair on the body that weren't hers.
so you think the killer snuck up behind her and stabbed her?
I can't say. - Well, take a guess.
I'm a scientist. - So's Maura. She does it.
I'm not Dr. Isles.
I know that, but she's not here. So, throw out a theory.
stretch your wings and grow. It's your time to shine.
that's a mixed metaphor.
okay, see. There you go. That's very Maura.
Nope. Okay.
# You thought you were tough # - Oh, hey, Angela.
# You thought you were hard # - Hi. Who's that?
Bobby Symanski, my friend Peter's grandson.
he's good. - Very.
I like that song.
his grandfather wrote it. We used to have a band.
Wow. He must be proud.
# Come on and take a little walk ... # - He's dead.
I'm sorry.
Oh, it's a long time ago. Bobby dropped this off.
he's playing in Boston.
that's great. You gonna go see him?
he wants me to play with him. - Vince, even better!
I don't play those songs anymore. It's not who I am.
you know, in one lifetime, we lead a lot of different lives.
well, that one's over. - If ... you want it to be.
tell Jane I was looking for her. - Sure thing.
luis was an almost constant presence at the house the last year.
so he witnessed Judith's total transformation.
Hi! - Hold on.
no more shots for Carla. - I'm not driving!
more shots for Carla! - Whoo!
continue. Well, they spent a lot of time together.
uh, maybe that allowed Luis to think there was something more going on than her just being nice.
what is going on in your room?
I've turned it into a hospitality suite with an open bar.
Ah! Good job, Gary!
he hit the bull's-eye. - Great.
well, it looks like you're having fun. - Jane, it's a nightmare.
Carla is out of control, and they've wrecked my room.
and now they think I'm this crazy party person.
you're not?
look, don't do anything that makes you uncomfortable, all right? Just be yourself.
right. Absolutely. Good advice.
Dr. Isles! We're dry over her!
well, give me that bottle of rye, and I'll show you how to make a Dr. Pecker!
Hey, Frankie.
uniforms spotted Luis' car in the South end.
okay. Where are you?
in an alleyway near the corner of Mass and Columbus.
there he is, Jane. I gotta go.
he's coming out the back. Move. Move!
Freeze! Boston police!
put your hands on the car.
get your hands on the car!
okay! Ow! Okay!
didn't you learn anything the last time you got arrested, Luis? Don't run.
makes you look guilty. No, I'm innocent, man!
tell us what happened yesterday morning.
I showed up for work at the Barnetts'. I knocked on the door.
no one answered. So I used my key.
I walked around, and I found Mrs. Barnett.
but I didn't do it. - Then why did you run?
because I've got a record. Because I know how it looks.
cause no one believes an ex-con. Do you have your initials on all your tools?
no, just my knife.
to remind me that what's used for evil can also be used for good.
and where is that knife now?
I don't know. I can't find it.
you've got multiple priors for robbery,
breaking and entering, three separate stabbings.
all that time in the house with Judith.
you must have thought that could go somewhere.
so you made a move on her. And when she refused, you got mad.
that could have happened. - It did happen.
no. But it could have.
I had no self-control.
when I got out of prison the last time, even moms told me she wasn't gonna be there for me, that I had shamed her, that I ... that I had shamed god.
and I heard her.
I went back to our church. I went to A. A.
moms gave me my room back, and I moved in so she could see I was trying.
and I changed.
well, Judith was changing, too. That must have been attractive to you.
Yes. Yes, it was.
I-I ...
she became a different person. S-s-she ...
it gave me hope. I told her so.
she inspired me.
what does your gut tell you? We need evidence.
he knew the victim. He was in her house.
the murder weapon belonged to him.
what about motive? - I can think of 10.
me, too, but none of them feel right.
we've got no witnesses and nothing but the knife to tie him to the murder.
what do you want to do?
give me five minutes.
Susie! I was, uh, just coming to talk to you.
Oh, I'm not there. I'm here. To show you how I shine.
okay. Great.
what's that? - It's my theory.
your theory's in a box? It's a "die-o-rama."
Oh. D-I-E. - Yes.
for dead people. - Well, not all of them are dead.
but it's a representation of how they got to be. It's amazing.
Yes.
and the killer is wearing a Tyvek suit. Yes.
because there was no forensic evidence found at the crime scene, which means the killer was wearing some sort of protective outerwear.
the handyman had Tyvek suits in his truck.
Yes. - You made all this just to tell me that?
no, I made this to figure it out. I'm a visual thinker.
well ... It's fantastic.
really. Susie, thank you. We got him.
except the handyman didn't do it. - Okay, but you said ...
the handyman's too tall to make the stab wounds at the angle of entry they were made on Judith's body.
see, this killer is to scale, but your suspect would not be to scale.
but the Tyvek suit ...
he uses them a lot. Maybe someone knew that.
you just guessed. - I ... theorized.
you guessed. No, no. You guessed.
that was a guess. That was ...
you don't use these things to illustrate stuff - in your personal life, right? - Uh ... okay.
Luis, you spent a lot of time at the Barnett house.
did you ever see anything unusual?
mostly Mrs. Barnett was alone.
the only person that came by was the Tough Broad guy.
Mickey Rizzo. - Yeah, the boxer.
he was over all the time ... private coaching.
they always closed the door.
we talked to Luis Benitez's parole officer, his A. A. sponsor, his mother, his bible-studies group.
they all tell the same story ... He's a changed man.
the knife wounds are precise and deliberate.
not what you'd expect from an ex-con with anger issues.
and Susie says he's not to scale. What?
we'll talk about Susie when you get back. Hey.
I think it's time we go meet the man - who turned Judith into a tough broad. - I've got another lead to pursue.
take Frankie. - Sure. You okay?
great.
did you get a chance to go over those case files I sent you?
Jane, you shouldn't have sent these.
it's a serious violation of protocol. This is Dr. Crosby's case.
he's the only one authorized to release these files.
well, I didn't want to bother him. He was too busy going slow.
well, this makes e very uncomfortable.
just take a look, please. See if you see anything.
come on, Maura! We're playing "autopsy jeopardy!"
well, I see you've turned it back into your kind of convention.
Oh, yeah. Last night was a bit much.
Carla threw my toilet seat out the window.
one game, and then we're watching my slide show.
Oh, no, don't do that to the ...
Hey, Vince! - Hey.
this thing is huge!
if Maura ever kicks me out, I'm gonna move right in.
what's that? - My old guitar, from when I played with Bobby's grandfather.
I'm gonna give it to Bobby. That's nice. It's not what he wants.
Yeah, but it's family history. - History is for old people.
well, what do you think he wants? - Come on, Vince.
you're smarter than that. Think about it.
Bye! - Bye-bye.
how well do you know Judith Barnett?
very well. She joined the gym a year ago.
Hey, what she did with her body took a lot of work and a lot of time.
you gave her a lot of personal attention, make her feel special.
I mean, yeah. That's a big part of my job.
Really? - Look, these women ...
they don't get a lot of attention from their husbands.
they come here to feel better about themselves.
and if part of that's me flirting with them, well, hey, that's good for business.
you ever go to her house? - I set up her gym.
are we gonna find your DNA in her bedroom? Why are you asking about DNA?
were you having an affair with Judith Barnett?
no. Look. You know what? Judy was a client.
where were you yesterday morning between 7: 00 and 9: 00?
asleep. - Alone?
you know what?
I'm not gonna answer any more questions, all right? Okay.
we're gonna need a list of your clients and your investors.
and we'll let them answer the questions.
Hey, you know what? I'm the pride of East Boston, all right?
I'm golden gloves in two weight classes.
that's great, but it does ... - Hey, you know, it's taken me years to build this business and gain these women's trust.
you were alone when she was murdered. That doesn't help you.
you see how this looks, Mickey?
all right, look. I wasn't alone.
what's her name? - This could ruin me.
prison will ruin you.
look, you got it all wrong. It's not like that.
I mean, these women here, they're all great, but ...
I'm gay.
it would kill my business if it got out.
all right. All right. It won't get out.
thank you. - Yeah.
look, Judy wasn't doing anything with anyone.
she spent all her time working out. But this dentist, he just ...
I don't know. He lost interest in her.
did she talk to her husband about this?
for sure, she did. She invited him to come down here, see what this place was all about, but he never came.
you know, she thought they'd work out together once they got the gym in the house, but he never did.
all he did was go to his old cabin every weekend and leave a beautiful woman at home, alone.
Thanks, Mickey. We'll let you know if we need anything else.
well, he was doing something. - Or someone.
it's not exactly something a married man leaves out in the open when he's cheating.
one toothbrush, a can of shaving cream, a single disposable razor.
no sign of another person being here, let alone a woman.
Yeah, same thing here ...
a couple of single-serve frozen dinners from the trash, water bottles.
he wasn't here to fish, either. No poles, no tackle, no boat.
well, so what? He comes up here to get away from it all and practice his dentistry skills?
something you should see outside.
is Alan opening a fruit stand? - It's not a great location.
better be some interesting garbage.
I think it's a bullet hole.
I think Alan used these for target practice.
so what? The victim was stabbed.
I know it doesn't make any sense, but ...
no. You're right. It's crazy.
Alan's amazing wife is waiting at home and he's out here in woodlandia, playing with his dental tools and shooting at watermelons?
Why? There's got to be more to it.
let's get all this back to the crime lab, - Have Susie take a look at it. - Yep.
did you find anything yet? What's that?
it's not watermelon, but it came from inside of one.
the broken watermelons all have it.
well, can you take your best guess? Chalk?
I shouldn't. I can't.
Jane, Susie has been trained not to guess.
Really?
well, can she tell me what made these holes?
Circumferentially, they're the same dimension as a . 22-caliber bullet.
Jane, it took you one whole day to corrupt senior criminalist Chang.
pbht! - I'm so sorry, Dr. Isles.
detective Rizzoli means well, but you cannot let her impatience influence your methodology.
you forgot to activate the cone of silence.
well, can we at least talk about whatever it is you two are doing here?
Susie's pursuing an interesting line of inquiry, a forensic examination of the victims.
"Victims"? What ... What victims?
those aren't victims. Those are watermelons.
I am conducting a "fruit-opsy."
that's funny. - Hilarious. I'll check in later.
I'm going to go get a sus-ictionary.
there you go.
Hey, Vince. - Hey, Angela.
well, you can keep it from me, Vince, but you can't keep it from yourself.
it's a lot more complicated than the loss of an old friend, Angela.
complications. Secrets. Pain. Happiness.
they're all the spices in the soup.
you leave one out, it doesn't taste as good.
Peter & Vince.
we had a meeting with an A&R record guy from New York.
he took us out on the town. He wined us. He dined us.
at the end of the night, Peter wanted to go home. He wanted to see his wife and kid.
but not me. I was flying.
I didn't want that night to end.
I let him walk home alone, drunk.
he took a shortcut across some railroad tracks.
he fell. He hit his head.
never woke up. - Mm.
it snowed that night. Took a couple of days to find his body.
so ... How do I tell Bobby I killed his grandfather?
Oh, come on, Vince. You know that's not true.
well, I should have ...
no, this is not about you, my friend. This is about Bobby.
it's about what he wants, what only you can give him.
what the hell could I possibly give Bobby?
how about a little piece of his grandfather?
because he's still alive here in your heart.
detective Rizzoli, I have the lab report.
and another box. - It's my findings from the fruit-opsy.
they're a little hard to explain, so I did the only logical thing.
you made another die-o-rama. - To scale.
okay, well, Frankie said that he thought the watermelons were being used for target practice.
I agree.
the bullet traveled through and through this one.
the projectile struck the back wall of the watermelon and tore out a chunk.
but in that watermelon, the bullet didn't come out.
there were no bullets in the watermelons. Could you have missed them?
Oh, no, the external examination of the subjects showed no other means of exit.
and the X-rays were negative for any foreign bodies within.
e-except ... - Except what?
nothing. - Psst.
Maura's not here.
that stuff I found was dental plaster. It's made from gypsum.
and it was different in each watermelon.
almost as if they came from different batches.
he was trying to make a bullet that couldn't be detected in an autopsy.
he was? - Well, of course he was, Susie.
everyone knows the die-o-rama doesn't lie. I'll be careful.
Oh, no! I should have wrote "handle with care" on that one.
alan was trying to make a bullet out of dental plaster, something that would break apart once it entered Judith's body.
is that even possible?
air marshals use bullets that won't pass through a body and hurt an innocent passenger or damage the structure of the plane.
is that Susie's die-o-rama?
it's very realistic. And to scale, and the detail ...
focus, Maura.
well, I just think that detailed work deserves appreciation.
okay.
the plaster bullet that did this was too hard.
it went all the way throug, and it didn't break apart. So he mixed and remixed the plaster.
that would explain all the broken-up watermelons in the compost bin.
that's right. Until he found the perfect formula.
maximum damage with no exit wound. And there'd be no ballistics.
I'd like to remind everyone, again, that Judith Barnett was stabbed to death.
I'm not so sure of that.
I mean, there's something about the nature of the knife wounds that's been bothering me.
Frankie, can you pull up the X-rays?
see, this wound is narrow and it's not as deep as the surrounding damage.
is that a fragment from the dental plaster?
no, according to the autopsy report, it's a bone fragment that penetrated the pericardium.
it broke off. That's what happens when you are stabbed.
Yes, she was stabbed. But the wound track here is too narrow.
that bone fragment was not driven into the wound by the knife.
Jane, I'd like Susie to examine the bone fragments from the wounds.
okay, and I want her to test Judith's clothes for gunshot residue.
why would he shoot her first and then stab her?
because if Alan snuck up on this woman with a knife and she caught him, she'd kick his ass.
if Alan wanted to make a dental-plaster bullet, he'd need two things ...
he'd need a gun and something to make a cartridge.
well, the holes in the watermelons were the size of a . 22-caliber.
I borrowed some from ballistics.
he'd need to pull out the lead bullet from the casing and then replace it with the one he made.
he spent a lot of time pulling teeth with these things.
I believe he could take ... A bullet out of a cartridge.
well, that was easy enough. No gun license in Massachusetts or anywhere else for Alan Barnett. None for Judith, either.
so, how the hell did he get a gun?
I don't see Alan Barnett going out and making a street buy.
he didn't have to. This is a crime-scene photo of the cabin.
I had that part blown up.
young Alan Barnett had a Ruger Bearcat, . 22 caliber.
good little squirrel gun. I know Dr. Crosby says death by stabbing.
he's not Maura.
what have you got? - Hi, Detective Rizzoli.
I was just about to give my results to Dr. Isles.
well, you have done a wonderful job of not guessing and preserving your scientific mythology.
thank you. It's methodology, Jane.
I say tomato, you say "tomaht-ology.
what have we got? GSR on the clothes?
Susie, would you describe for us what you're seeing in the microscope?
Yes, of course, Dr. Isles.
there are no bone-growing cells or proteins present in these bone fragments.
these bone fragments are from cadaver bone, not your victim's ribs.
the bone fragments have to be part of the bullet that Alan made.
it's brilliant, really.
I mean, all he had to do was add pieces of cadaver bone to the dental plaster before it hardened.
he created the perfect delivery system.
and the knife wounds were meant to splinter the ribs to hide the cadaver bone in the wound tracks.
and to set up the handyman.
alan used Luis' knife. He knew he had a record.
it's a great plan, actually.
except for the one part that doesn't make sense.
why would a happily married man kill his wife after she a lost a hundred pounds?
cause he liked her just the way she was.
when he was the only man who paid her any attention.
Thanks.
trace evidence section found gunshot residue on Judith Barnett's crop top.
Jane, this changes everything.
now I need to notify Dr. Crosby of my findings.
although the stab wounds are significant injuries, given what I know now,
I'm revising my initial cause of death to gunshot wound.
it's time we had a talk with Alan Barnett.
thank you for coming in.
I know you must be very busy with your wife's arrangements.
detective Rizzoli and I are very sorry for your loss.
thank you. It has been very hard on me.
she was my friend, my partner, my lover.
she was everything to me.
you two must have had a great life together ...
travel, restaurants, weekends at the cabin.
did you go fishing up there? Hiking?
no. Not much.
no.
no, you wouldn't have.
no, you'd rather watch hiking on your TV.
in your big, soft chair, with Judith right next to you.
that's what we enjoyed. Yeah, but she stopped enjoying it, didn't she?
then she joined Tough Broad, got in shape, lost the weight, and good-looking men started paying attention to her.
big, strong men.
men like Luis and Mickey.
of course. She looked great.
and that made you happy.
it made her happy. That's what we want for our loved ones.
what a generous little man you are.
Hey! - Well, considering that your wife started a new life that you were no longer a part of.
my wife loved me. She would never leave me.
you were watching TV alone. Going to the cabin alone.
you two no longer had anything in common because she'd already left.
No! I would never have allowed ...
am I being placed under arrest?
you're free to go, Dr. Barnett. - Of course I am.
because you have a theory but no evidence.
I'm not much of a fisherman. Neither are you.
you've got nothing. And that's all you'll ever have.
he thinks he's smarter than us.
maybe he is. - Bullshit.
Where's Frankie? - We're meeting him in break.
you got something? - Yeah.
I had Susie take a blood sample from the patient that Alan was with the morning of his wife's murder.
ketamine? The animal tranquilizer?
according to Maura, dentists use it.
but an elderly patient like Mrs. Gold should be administered a very low dose.
she had a detectable level of ketamine still in her system.
48 hours after her surgery.
Mrs. Gold was really out of it of ketamine when we saw her.
Yeah, he knocked her out and gave himself the perfect window of opportunity.
strike one. I found the best route from Alan's office to his house.
no traffic cameras, no homeland security cameras.
15 minutes each way. Okay.
so, the handyman was scheduled to arrive at Alan's house while he was performing the gum graft.
but Judith had to be dead by then for the plan to work.
but she couldn't have been killed before he left for work or that would skew the time of death.
the receptionist said Alan was in with Mrs. Gold when she got there at 8: 00. Her appointment was 6: 30.
so, he worked on Mrs. Gold, made sure she was completely anesthetized, left at 7: 00?
this is me on the route to his house. He gets there at 7: 15.
pulls on a Tyvek suit, gloves and a mask, shoots Judith before she can kick his ass, and then stabs her with the knife that he stole from the handyman.
he drops the knife for us to find, takes off the Tyvek suit, heads for the office. 7: 40?
Yeah, but he's still got to get rid of the gun and the bloody Tyvek suit.
I had some uniforms look through all the dumpsters and trash barrels.
public works searched the storm drains and sewers. Nothing.
Yeah, he's too smart to leave anything close to the crime scene.
I know where Alan got rid of the gun and the Tyvek suit.
strike two!
thank you.
I'll take that.
you can't just ... - We called your courier service.
they said you were expecting a delivery.
you have no right. - This gives us that right.
when you absolutely, positively have to have it overnight.
which you did. Ruger, Bearcat, . 22 caliber.
it was a slick move, mailing yourself the only evidence that'll tie you to your wife's murder.
all you had to do was throw the gun in the nearest lake and burn the Tyvek suit in the woods.
pretty smart. - But not smart enough. Strike three.
at least I'm to scale.
you are so, so not to scale. Look at those things on your chest.
those things are perfect in form and balance.
look at you. You're all leg.
well, I'm exactly to scale because, you know, Susie doesn't guess.
well, she does now. Ooh, here she comes.
Hello, senior criminalist Chang. Very nice to see you, Susie.
Dr. Isles, detective. You both look nice tonight.
what? Did ... She didn't even notice.
you had your right arm up a bit more. - I was not.
you weren't ... You weren't bending your foot right.
I don't bend my feet. Objects in the die-o-rama appear bigger than they are.
well, hers. - Which ones?
general comment. Angela talked to you.
Yeah. That's why I'm here. - Me too.
I was thinking, when I go to next year's convention, you should come with me.
will they have "autopsy jeopardy!"? Yeah.
then I'm gonna schedule surgery for that weekend.
Hey, look who's back in town.
Hi. Hi, honey. - Hi, Ma. Mwah.
Hey, aren't you two a little too old to be playing with dolls?
what? We brought them for Frankie.
Oh, you're a riot, Janie.
Hello, Boston! Hello.
uh, tonight's a very special night.
I'm gonna do some songs my grandfather wrote, the way they were meant to be sung and the way they were meant to be played.
ladies and gentlemen, I am Bobby.
and I'm Vince.
Whoo! - Whoo! All right.
and tonight, we are Bobby & Vince.
Whoo! - Nice!
Thanks.
Sydney. - Just one. I promise.
any more than that, and I won't sit next to you at the bar.
sure you will, as long as my card keeps the tab open.
go order me another Sazerac. I'll be back in a second.
okay.
thank you.
it's a very bad habit.
well, you're carrying around a lighter, so I think ...
then I realize my fly is open ...
has been for the last 46 minutes.
now, there's only four minutes left in the class.
what do I do? Do I zip it up? Do I leave it alone?
I mean, I'm new.
is it better to be the guy who knew or the guy who had no idea?
and all these thoughts are swirling through my head, and I freeze.
I jus... go completely silent ...
Ticktock, ticktock ... for four minutes until the bell rings.
and ... and what?
did they all file out with their eyes down, desperately avoiding eye contact?
a couple students didn't look at me all semester.
uh, I'm gonna go get us ...
and, of course, I mean me ... refills.
okay.
he's great!
you think so? - Yes!
there's only one problem with tonight.
what? - You!
he's awesome. I'm awesome.
you ... way too stiff.
Maura, relax, okay? The evening is going great.
Oh, no, it isn't. Now I have all these water spots on my blouse.
great ... well, then, think about that instead of wondering whether or not we're having a good time, because we're having a good time.
Oh. What happened?
Oh, uh... I have the dropss.
do you want me to get you a towel? - Oh, no. No. It's fine.
but since we're telling funny stories, I ...
Really? You're gonna tell an embarrassing story about yourself?
okay, this ... this is a first. - No.
but remember the time we went to the Adirondacks? Don't you dare.
Jane and I had never tried it, so we went camping.
she really doesn't like this story.
did you really like him?
no. - What?!
well, I answered "yes" the first 17 times you asked. I'm thinking it's the wrong answer.
well, I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
I'm the other shoe? What do we got? Well, I didn't mean you were a shoe.
sydney Allen, out for a night with a friend.
came into the alley for a smoke. Two close-contact gunshot wounds.
sexual assault, you think?
well, I can't be sure till I do an exam, but clothing is intact.
and there doesn't seem to be any apparent signs of her resisting an attack.
attempted robbery?
victim's purse was 30 feet away. No cash in it.
but could be she wasn't carrying any.
okay, I'll check with the patrols, see if there were any late-night robberies in the vicinity.
well, she's married.
friend gave me his name. Judson, C. E.O. of a tech start-up.
I pulled his phone number from the victim's phone.
the dress doesn't exactly scream "homemaker." - No.
did you check to see if he called when she didn't come home? - Yep.
did he? - Nope.
could mean nothing.
there were five 911 calls. One of them was a report of a gunshot.
the others focus mainly on the victim. Nobody mentions a shooter.
we followed up with four of the callers But didn't get any new information.
what about the fifth? - Burner phone.
we're tracking it, but no luck so far.
Yeah, we struck out on the incident reports, as well.
interesting.
I called the husband right away, and when he didn't get back to me, I got a warrant for his credit cards.
turns out he checked in to the Merrimac hotel last night.
the one downtown? - Yep.
well, maybe this isn't a robbery.
maybe this is just divorce the hard way and he checked in to the hotel to give himself an alibi.
the most interesting of the textbooks is "police administration:
structures, processes, and behaviors.
720 pages of pure gold.
you had to memorize all that? - No, but they reserve the right to put anything from the book on the lieutenants exam.
I mean, structures and procedures, I get, but behaviors?
I mean ... we're cops. We're pains in the asses.
you need 720 pages to dissect that?
you're gonna do fine on the exam, by the way. Yeah, we'll see.
well, you're the best sergeant detective in the building.
they'd be idiots not to promote you.
if I don't study a little more, they might be idiots if they do.
well, what's your textbook have to say about that?
time of death was after Sydney's, but not by much.
what about the weapon? Can you determine if it was the same for both murders?
you know I can't answer that question now, sergeant.
we know, but it never gets old asking. How about the same-caliber bullet?
well, I'll take a leap into the void and say that this bullet is the same caliber as the one I removed from Sydney Allen.
let's assume that both victims were killed by the same person.
I'm not willing to assume that. - Okay.
let's say that Korsak and I are willing to assume that both victims were killed by the same person.
that narrows our list of suspects down to people that needed them both dead.
interesting that the wife was killed first.
could be that the murderer knew Judson was here and wasn't going anywhere.
maybe. Frankie's getting the security videotape.
maybe we'll get a look at him.
excuse me.
which one of you got the call about Judson Allen?
that'd be me. - Hi. You're new.
Frank... ie Rizzoli. - I'm Nin... a Holiday.
you temping? No. This is my new assignment.
you gonna need some time to settle in? Nope.
allen co-founded a company called Inverta.
there's no public information, but I found a thread ina Venture Capital blog about a Boston-based biogen company getting a new eight-figure investment.
turns out the V. C. mentioned flew into Boston yesterday and checked in to the Merrimac hotel.
so, Judson Allen's about to hit the mother lode.
looks like it. - You're not from Boston, are you?
no ... Chicago.
cubs or White Sox? - Cubs.
no self-respecting White Sox fan would move to Boston.
Hey, uh, thanks for finding us a motive.
also, I got the hotel videotape.
this is the only person who exits the elevator during your time frame.
he doesn't want to be seen, does he? - No, but...
I pulled his reflection from the glass - on the picture frame on the wall. - Nice.
welcome to beantown, Nina Holiday.
ballistics confirm that Sydney and her husband were killed by the same gun.
and these striations indicate that a silencer was used.
professional hit. - That's not what I'm saying.
sorry. I'm not putting that in your mouth.
I'm saying it 'cause I get to say whatever the hell I want.
nobody asks me for scientific evidence to support it.
well, lucky you.
Oh, you wouldn't do it even if the commonwealth said you could.
no, probably not. - The real question is, why did someone hire a hit man to kill them?
Oh. I'm not expecting you to answer. I'm just thinking out loud. Thanks, doc.
looks like a professional hit. - Really?
Yeah, same gun, silencer, and it takes a lot of confidence to kill somebody through a peephole.
well, our guy is coming into a lot of money.
maybe we start at the company he founded. This is yours.
Oh, what is it? - Toffee.
I made that up. It's wrapped. I don't know what it is.
you would.
grover Verben, the Dodgers' lefty lion.
this is awesome! - Who gave it to you?
Maura's new boyfriend.
must be quite a guy. Bet that's an expensive gift.
you think he's trying to buy influence? - Is it gonna work?
no. But, still, a cool gift.
detective Korsak? Mr. Harper's here.
I'll be right there.
and this is why there are no Vince Korsak-signed baseballs.
that and my . 128 lifetime batting average.
Really? - You don't want to know.
Really?
I can't believe it. I just...
I can't believe they're dead.
wish we'd signed the financing papers at the V. C.'s yesterday.
that's a pretty callous response, Mr. Harper.
no. I-I just mean that it would give our employees a chance to find new jobs while they have a paycheck. The company's gonna have to shut down?
we've got money in the bank to carry us a week or two, but... Judson was the genius behind Inverta.
without him, I won't be able to fund a garage sale.
so, who benefits if Judson's dead?
is there some other company that has a competing technology?
the murders weren't random? - We don't think so.
I can't think of anybody who'd want to kill them.
why is that funny, Mr. Harper?
well, I can't think of anybody who'd want to kill Judson, but... if Sydney were the only one dead, - it'd be easy to think that Judson was the one that killed her. - Excuse me?
he hated her. Judson grew up in a terrible neighborhood outside Philadelphia, scraped his way into an Ivy League school.
he founded his first company before he graduated.
when he met Sydney, he was impressed by her sophistication.
so what took the bloom off the rose? - When Inverta took off, it became clear she was just a gold digger.
she'd found the shiniest fish in the pond and attached herself to it.
so Judson wanted a divorce. He just didn't want to give her half his money.
something like that.
you called? - Hey, Janie. You met Nina?
no. Hi. Jane Rizzoli. - Rizzoli? Like...
Yep. I'm the reason the department has a nepotism policy.
no, you're the reason the department got rid of vending machines. - Nice.
what do you got? - A couple things.
first, we found three $10, 000 withdrawals from Judson Allen's personal account made three weeks ago.
I thought the hit man killed Judson over a payment dispute.
but if he paid him in advance, it doesn't make any sense.
you said "a couple things"? - We ordered the 911 calls in case there was anything that wasn't in the transcripts.
on the face of it, nothing. But... Go ahead. Play it.
Nina pulled down the level in the voices.
a woman just got shot behind the Beacon club.
that's from the first call ... from the burner phone.
this is the second call. Send an ambulance! My friend's been shot!
now, in the first call, you can't hear any background noises, but in the second call, you can hear sounds from the club.
which means that the person who made the call from the burner phone was in the alley before someone came out and discovered the body.
a witness. - Yeah.
so, Judson hires a hit man to kill his wife. The two of them aren't gonna rat on each other.
but once there's a witness who can identify the hit man,
Judson becomes a liability. That's why Judson's dead.
the killer is covering his tracks.
if the girl in that call isn't dead already, she will be if we don't get to her before the hit man does.
purse was over here? - Yeah, about 30 feet from the victim.
well, maybe he dropped it when he realized there was a witness.
he had a gun. If she'd been close, he'd have shot her.
right. So, if she ran out of the alley, she just would have kept running.
we would have seen her on the street cameras.
so... she never left the alley.
clear. - Clear.
Korsak, look at this.
this stuff isn't dusty.
it's homework. - From a high school.
we're looking for a kid. Well, what the hell is she doing down here?
techs finished in the basement.
they didn't find any other bullets or any traces of blood, so, hopefully, our witness survived.
could be she got herself locked in the basement long enough she was able to get away from him.
we're checking to see if any cameras picked her up on the other side of the building. Nothing so far.
what about an I. D? - Not yet.
the textbook is used throughout the Boston public school system.
the good news is, only three schools are offering the class for the summer session.
and we have calls in to all of them.
and I've got a bot searching FBI wiretaps looking for the names of local guys who might have done the hit.
it's a long shot, but...
well, I don't know what "a bot" is, but I appreciate the effort.
what do you think of her?
who? Nina? - Yeah.
she seems all right ... helpful.
least likely to leave cheeto crumbs on the keyboard. Why?
she's our new homicide hire.
what? - Yeah.
I got wind of a chicago P. D. uniform that was transferring in the department.
so, why isn't she on the streets? - She wanted to make a change.
didn't think it'd be received well back home.
there's got to be more to it than that. Probably, but what I cared about ...
she has a perfect service record, a clean psych eval, and B. P.D. bought my argument that for now, we'd be better off with a dedicated bric homicide analyst than another detective.
what about Frankie? - Same job. He just got a new employee.
you did this so it'd be easy on me, didn't you?
I did it because it's the best thing for the unit.
grover Verben. That kid's parents didn't do him any favors.
ma, that's not the point. It's a fantastic gift.
amazing. Why'd you spill all over it?
I didn't!
it hit the coffee cup, and that spilled, and then it rolled into ...
so it's the ball's fault? - Please?
please, can you get it out? Please?
it won't be easy. - But you can do it. You can.
remember when I spilled motor oil on my communion dress?
I mean, when you were finished with it, it looked like new.
all right, give me some time and, uh, I'll work my magic.
thank you, because I checked online, and a replacement is 500 bucks.
I'm sure it is.
look ... a little white vinegar gently rubbed around it.
I'll make it look like new.
but worse comes to worst, you tell Maura that y-you had an accident.
as a last resort. Come on.
her new boyfriend gives me a fantastic gift, I don't want to tell her I ruined it.
all right. Stop worrying. I'll fix it.
you can do it, Ma. Thank you.
thank you so much. Thank you. You can do it.
thank you, Ma!
who's that?
Nina's bot found five guys who could have done the hit.
of those, one's dead, two are in jail, leaving these two handsome fellows as our most likely local suspects.
Judson's business partner said he was from the rough side of Philadelphia.
we should check to see if he contacted anyone back home.
girl named Tasha Williams takes that physics class at Monroe High School.
she didn't show up to class today. No one called to say she'd be absent.
can you get us directions to the high school? I'll send them to you in the car.
what is it? - It's directions.
Nina will send them to you while you're standing right there.
what are you doing home in the middle of the day?
Oh, I was working on a file in the bathtub last night, and I forgot to bring it back to the office.
is that relaxing? - Well, a bath releases stress responses, which is good for my hippocampus.
that helps memory and learning, which helps me arrive at new solutions to problems.
and since not being able to figure things out sparks a negative response from my sympathetic nervous system, - the bath works on all fronts. - Oh...
I like a bath, too. I catch up on my People magazines.
where did that come from? - What?
uh, that's my, uh, Blober Beiber, uh, n-nurr ball.
grover Verben. It was Jack's, and he gave it to Jane.
Yes. That was so nice of him.
what a lovely gift. It's a family heirloom.
Yeah, but what is it doing here?
Enh! - Angela?
Maura? Let it go.
stop it! Stop it!
the "ben" is silent.
the "ben" is not silent. It's missing.
what happened to it? - I don't know.
maybe he got tired signing all those autographs.
all right, Jane spilled coffee on it, - and she asked me to get the stain out. - Well, you did.
it's just too bad the stain was on the signature.
I know. I made it worse. Jane brought it to me because she thinks I'm some kind of whiz with the stain removal.
Yeah, she did say once that you got motor oil out of her communion dress.
Yeah. Kind of. I-I bought her a new one.
so you kind of didn't. - It's mom logic.
don't worry. It's not a big deal.
Yeah, it will be to Jane when she finds out.
she doesn't want to hurt Jack's feelings.
she doesn't? That's sweet.
no, and I think it's totally neurotic. - It's sweet.
so it doesn't matter that I erased half his name?
it'll matter to Jane.
I hate baseball.
Tasha is a wonderful young woman.
it's remarkable how well she does here, given her circumstances.
which are what? - I'm almost certain she's homeless.
almost certain? - She's guarded about anything personal.
clean but often wears the same outfit one day to the next, and there's no phone number on file. Those are giveaways.
any idea where we might find her?
we have an address on file.
but I don't think she's there. Even her family is looking for her.
her family? - An uncle was in this morning.
he said they hadn't seen her in a couple of days.
he came to school to make sure she was okay.
is this him?
he didn't have a beard, the hair was lighter, but there's definitely a similarity.
he's shaved his beard. I'll update our BOLO.
can you tell me about the uncle?
he said the family was worried and wanted to know if Tasha had come to school.
I asked his name to check if he was one of her responsible parties.
he wasn't, so I told him I couldn't give him any information.
and then he left? - Not right away.
the phone rang, and there was nobody there when I picked it up.
okay. Um, can you call us if he comes back?
thank you very much.
he got a look at her records. He's got all her information ...
an address, social security number. - How did he get here?
she was doing homework in the basement. Maybe he saw a backpack, a textbook.
until we catch this guy, everything's by the book.
I want you to promise me you'll follow B. P.D. protocols no matter what.
Yeah, fine, fine. - Maybe I'll make lieutenant and you'll get to work with someone new ... who doesn't know you as well as I do.
I hope you do make lieutenant.
I'm gonna put superglue on your big, fancy chair.
I wouldn't expect anything less.
uniforms went to the address Tasha had on file with the school. It was an abandoned building.
any evidence she was there? - Looks like maybe not for a while.
but the big news is this.
we tracked down her parents. They're both dead.
dad ... five years ago of an aneurysm. Mom ... 18 months ago, cancer.
all right. Well, then, why isn't she in foster care?
social services think she's in the custody of her grandmother.
and I'm sure all the information on her grandmother is bogus.
100, 000%. - Extreme bogosity.
but let me get this straight.
teenager scams social services, and she's living on the street, taking care of herself for at least 18 months while going to school?
and maintaining a B-plus average. How does she survive?
well, if her parents are dead, she's entitled to survivor benefits from social security.
give her enough money to live on ... at least the basics.
any chance the S. S.A. will give us the address they've been mailing the checks to?
it'll take time. Well, she's got to cash them somewhere.
can you look up those check-cashing places?
look for one around the crime scene, her school, and that abandoned building she lived in.
we'll have to split up. I don't like it ... not with a hit man out there.
Yeah, but what other choice do we have?
hold on ... this guy killed a woman, then he killed the guy that hired him to do it, and now he's trying to kill this girl that witnessed the first murder.
vests ... everybody. - Okay.
Jane? - It's in the car.
Yeah, I recognize her. She hasn't been in this month.
but checks come in Tuesday, so she'll probably be in Wednesday.
any chance you could pull security video from the last month?
maybe she came in with somebody. I can't even go in the room with the recorder.
the manager yells at me. I tend to spill.
I find it hard to believe that a man like you could be bullied.
well, I wouldn't say "bullying," really.
that's kind of a strong ... - You know what I think?
I think he's using his aggression to cover his fear.
he's the manager. - He feels threatened.
by...? - Exactly.
he sees what I see ... a man that challenges authority.
sometimes I'm late, and I don't even call.
that's exactly what I'm talking about.
I think you're gonna have a chain of these places and that manager's gonna work for you. Unless...
forget it.
um... thank you very much for your time.
No! Wait!
unless what?
unless you decide what's right and what's wrong.
a girl's life is at stake here, and you can help her.
we've got a terrible connection. Where are you?
grand Street. I got a lead on Tasha.
it's a partial address from her social security check.
well, that's a start.
let's meet at B. P.D. and ... - Listen, I'm gonna ...
I'm gonna look around... Okay?
I can't hear you, Jane. Hello?
Korsak, I can't hear you, all right? So I'll call you if I find something definitive.
Tasha, my name is Detective Jane Rizzoli.
I'm just here to help. Tasha, you here?
wait! No! Tasha, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
open the door.
please.
you're in danger!
he's looking for you.
please. Wait, no. I know what you saw!
please, honey!
I know what you saw. I know you're scared.
please.
come on.
if I can find you, he can find you. Okay?
please open the door.
show me your badge.
I just want to protect you. That's all.
you all right?
okay.
that's ... that's my car right there. Okay?
I just want to take you to B. P.D. headquarters, and ... and we'll get you someplace safe. All right?
okay?
come on.
okay. Get up, baby.
okay.
just hang on. It's okay.
just hang on. Okay.
it's all right.
it's all right. It's all right. We're safe.
we're between floors, okay? - Okay.
I'm gonna sleep now.
no, no, no. Tasha. No, no, no, no.
no. Hey! Hey. You stay with me, okay?
you stay awake. Okay? - Okay.
um... here.
listen to me, okay? Listen to me.
listen to me.
all right? This is real important, okay?
there, uh... There are three criminals, okay?
and they were sentenced to exile in the desert.
okay? - What are you ... what?
Shh. It's a joke. It's a joke.
don't talk. You'll mess up my rhythm.
all right. The first criminal says...
all right.
I brought a loaf of bread, so if I get hungry,
I have something to eat.
and the second criminal says, "oh, yeah? Well, I brought a canteen.
if I get thirsty, I got something to drink.
huh? And the third criminal, he looks at these guys like they're idiots, you know?
cause he's a lot smarter than they are. He's real proud of himself, right?
and he says, "oh, yeah? "Well, I brought a car door, so if I get hot, I can roll down a window.
that's terrible. - Yeah.
you're sneaky. - Yeah.
I'm sorry, baby. I knew that was gonna hurt.
you were shot, too. - Yeah, but I was dressed for it.
I want you to keep pressure on that, okay? And I'm gonna get some help.
Oh, come on. I can never get service in this building.
okay. Okay.
okay. Look.
I've always wanted to use of these things.
okay?
no. - It's all right.
it's all right. Okay?
my team knows where we are, okay?
they'll be here in no time.
it's all right, baby. Hang on.
you find Jane yet? - Nobody's heard from her.
she's not picking up her phone.
I'm triangulating pings from her last call, but it's still a six-block radius on grand.
we should have something soon. - No, let's go now.
I want to be close by when she does call. Come on.
come on!
I took auto shop when I was in high school.
I hot-wired a Volvo for my final. - No more jokes, please.
who's joking? Huh?
Connelly Group.
this is Detective Jane Rizzoli. I'm in an elevator in one of your buildings, and I need assistance, both police and ambulance.
copy that. First, I need your exact location.
you have my location. I'm on a phone in one of your buildings.
check your screen.
Connelly Group manages 63 buildings in and around Boston.
uh, it ... it's the one under construction. We have eight under construction.
none of them are wired in.
okay. Okay. I-it's the one on Grand Street.
we have two on Grand. - You call the Boston police department, and you tell them there's an officer in distress.
inform Sergeant Detective Korsak. Send them to this street.
patch me through to Dr. Maura Isles in the medical examiner's office, and do it now!
got it. Stay on the line.
try making a left.
I don't want to risk getting stuck in traffic. If we take the bridge, we can get a clear signal.
Yeah.
okay. Okay. Got it.
Jane's in a building on the 2000 block on Grand. She's stuck in an elevator with Tasha.
get more cars there fast. Nina, call an ambulance.
did you hear about the girl?
the 14-year-old who came up with the new energy source?
um, sorry. One sec.
Ah, no, forget it. What was the energy source?
so, body heat.
it took her four months to come up with the algorithm, but she actually came up with the idea...
...during a dream, and ...
get it. - No. Go on.
I'm sorry. Okay.
hello. - Dr. Isles, this is Tim Curran.
I'm a security guard with the Connelly Group. I have an officer in distress in need of assistance.
put him on. - You're connected.
Maura, it's Jane. I'm in an elevator.
Jane? Are you okay? - I'm with Tasha. And she's hurt.
she got a gunshot to the brachial artery. Is everything all right?
okay, Jane, you need to apply direct pressure to her wound.
Yeah, yeah, I did that. - Good. Now, where are you?
grand Street. I don't know the address. - It's the 2000 block.
Jane, are you okay? - Yeah.
uh, he took a shot at me, but I was wearing my vest. I'm fine.
I'm coming. Sir, keep us connected.
and if you lose me, call me back. - I'll drive.
what else can I do? Jane, you've got to get her out of there.
I can't. We're trapped.
has she lost a lot of blood? - Yeah.
okay, she's gonna go into shock, so you need to keep her awake, and she needs an ambulance right away.
okay. Hold on.
okay, Tasha.
I got to leave you for a second, okay?
I want you to talk to my friend Dr. Isles, okay? Okay.
Hi, Tasha.
Dr. Isles. - No, call me Maura.
you know, in the second grade, I had a friend named Tasha.
and she had this dream of becoming an electrical engineer.
what do you want to be? - I haven't decided yet.
well, we all have dreams, even if we're afraid that if we say them out loud, they might become less real.
I don't know you.
which is why I'm the perfect person to tell.
Tasha? Are you there? - Doctor...
please ... call me Maura. - I want to be a doctor...
an oncologist ... so I can save someone else's life.
you stay awake, okay?
Oh, god.
here. Here.
okay. I'm gonna go ... hey. All right?
Maura, you just keep talking, all right?
don't stop talking. - I can do that.
here. Okay? I'll be right back.
hang on.
Tasha, did I tell you that the pioneering oncologist who elevated chemotherapy to a viable treatment option was a woman ... Dr. Jane Wright?
she died in 2013. - Yes. She was 93.
and she was black. - Yes, she was.
my dream isn't a dream. It's a path.
Dr. Jane Wright's path.
it's an excellent path, Tasha, and I'm sure you'll walk it.
Tasha, are you there?
Tasha, you need to keep talking to me.
TASHA! All right, go faster.
geez. - We're almost there, Tasha.
I need you to stay with me.
what? - There's two.
take that one. Get me if you find her.
stay off the walkie.
we don't want this guy finding us before we find Jane.
I'll keep tracing her phone.
Nina, get him. Jane's in here.
elevators? Look.
stairs.
sorry, ma'am, but I can't let you through the tape.
I'm Dr. Maura Isles, the chief medical examiner. I know the condition of the people inside.
I need to work with the EMTs to prepare proper triage.
okay. Thank you. - Uh, sorry, sir.
I'm ... I'm with her. - Okay.
wait for me. - I want to help.
you are helping. You're here.
Janie? Hey.
Hey. - What? Where...?
the EMTs are working on her, Jane.
I'll see you at the hospital.
you did good, Jane. You did really good.
that's not gonna make her get here any faster.
maybe not, but it'll prove my point. Which is...?
which is if she'd taken Boylston Street like I said, she would have been here 10 minutes ago.
she may not have the letter.
I went to see the department doctor a week ago. I was fine then. I'm finer now.
it's just taking them too long to clear me for duty.
okay, look, I know how badly you really want to get back to work, but I must admit that it's been really nice having you here, and I'm sad that you're leaving.
me too.
so sad.
you know, you couldn't be happier if I told you that I had magically turned all the lettuce in the world into beer.
make it happen. We'll find out.
you should consider buying some luggage.
everybody thought I was homeless.
bags don't show dirt. I'll take that.
it's not in ... Ma, is this everything?
Yeah. Look, I understand you're disappointed, but the doctor must think that you need some more time to heal.
no, I need to go back to my own apartment and my job so I can feel like a grown woman.
a grown woman who uses garbage bags for luggage.
but I see your point.
lie down. I'll get you some snacks.
what am I supposed to do all day ...
lay here and dream about a world with no salad?
Oh, you could read magazines, and you could ...
you could just let your mom take care of you.
okay, but as my best friend and a doctor, will you do me one favor? - Anything.
put me in a medically induced coma.
I'm going to the market. - Just one little coma.
is it really too much to ask? You'd have better luck asking me to give you oxycontin.
well, can I have some of those, then?
hell of a way to get my attention, Rick.
well, thanks for coming, Vince. - As if I had a choice.
I've barely seen you since high school, you tell me you're dying, and I'm the only one you can trust with your final request.
well, what can I say? You won the last-request competition.
who came in second? - Guy in cellblock "D.
so, listen, Vince, um...
I got six months left... tops.
I don't want to die with my son still thinking that I set the fire that killed his mother and his sister.
Hey, I'm a cop, not a hypnotist. - I did not set that fire.
even if that's true, Rick, you have exhausted all your appeals.
I don't care about the courts. Listen to me.
my son only knows me as this selfish, lying, fall-down drunk.
that's not who I am anymore. - I'll call him.
see if he'd be willing to come by and say goodbye.
he won't. He doesn't want to hear from me.
after I got locked up, I wrote him a letter a week ...
sometimes two. He never responded.
about three years ago, the letters started coming back with no forwarding address.
listen to me, Vince. The only way my son will see me is if he knows I did not set that fire, which I did not.
I swear it.
well, you seem like you've gotten your act together in here.
sometimes, prison does that for people. Write another letter.
I'll find Jason. I'll take it to him myself.
you were the smartest guy in the neighborhood, and you've been a smart cop for a long time.
Vince, all I'm asking is that you just ... take a look at my case.
give it two or three hours, and if you're not convinced, then just walk away.
don't give it another thought.
I'll take a look. But no promise about what happens after that.
thank you.
she wanted to massage my feet. - Well, that's very nice.
Yes, when I was 3. Now it's just a little weird.
you almost died. She's your mother.
she's just having some kind of a post-traumatic response.
uh, come in.
sorry to bother you on a Saturday night.
what a surprise. Thank you.
Barolo 2009. What's the occasion?
well, I've been looking over a case from awhile back, and I was hoping you'd be willing to look at yesterday's science through today's lens.
how old is old? - Wow. 15 years.
double homicide, arson.
Rick Sullivan. Mm. Killed his wife and child.
did you get your medical-release letter yet?
no.
sorry. - Oh, Vince, come on.
the department rules are clear ...
no department business until you've got a doctor's okay to return to duty.
it's a file that I'm reading at hom...
no, someone else's home.
technically, it's department business.
you were in the drug unit 15 years ago. This isn't even your case.
no. And I'm annoyed at myself for saying yes I would do it.
but it's hard to tell a dying man to buzz off, especially if you've known him for 50 years.
you're a very good man, Vince.
Yes. And a bit of a hard-ass when it comes to some of your closest friends.
it's a day or two. You'll be fine.
I went through the files. The D. A. had a pretty strong case against him.
Rick was a broke alcoholic, and his wife had an insurance policy worth 750, 000 bucks.
the clincher... is the arson report.
they found acetone on his pants. It's the same accelerant that was used to start the fire.
when we were kids, Rick would give you the shirt off his back.
he took a lot of hits protecting his sisters from his dad.
if the science says he did it, he did it.
all I promised him was a fair look.
well, I guess we should get started.
and when I say "we," of course, I mean the two of you because I'm not cleared for duty, so...
good luck. Good night.
sleep well. - I did not see that coming.
thanks for coming in on Sunday. - No problem.
I just figure while Maura's looking at the forensics, it wouldn't hurt to take another look at the shoe leather.
I was just sitting here for a minute.
like we talked about ... better than leaving it empty all the time.
well, the table was pretty packed anyway. Yeah, where'd that come from?
I brought up the archives in case we needed them.
did you know them well? - I never even met the wife.
saw Rick and his daughter in a park a couple times.
a cute kid. - Yeah.
so I've been through the interviews with Rick.
over five days, he never once changed his story.
he said he got drunk and blacked out like most nights, came to coughing up smoke in the yard.
the son, Jason, was lucky that tree was right outside his bedroom window. - I doubt it felt lucky at the time.
Yeah. Were you able to track him down?
he's married with a baby. They live in Dedham.
you gonna talk to him? - Not unless we find something.
the kid's been through enough. If we don't get traction, we're gonna do this for one day. That's it.
we're not looking to overturn a conviction here ... just looking for doubt.
Maura wants to talk to me. - Well, I'm all set here.
I'll let you know if I find anything.
all right, I was thinking about going over to Rudy's and picking up your favorite pastrami sandwich.
Uh-huh. - Hello?
I mean, I usually mention Rudy's, and you're at the front door with car keys in your teeth.
what are you doing, Ma? Just wondering what's grabbed your attention.
uh... I was just reading this fascinating article ...
10 ways to please my man and make him happy as a clam... with a candle.
well, that's a new one. - It's fascinating stuff.
huh. The candle or the clam?
I'm sorry. What ... you were saying something before?
Yeah, um...
I was gonna go to Rudy's and pick us up some sandwiches.
Oh, really? Yeah.
I ... that sounds great. I'd love that.
all right. I'll be back in a bit.
Thanks. - Least I could do. So?
so, I looked over everything.
the burn pattern and depth of charring indicate a fire that burned unusually hot, so I took another look at the victims' autopsies.
M. E. said they died of smoke inhalation.
well, in 1999, that was the catchall term used to describe inhalation-type death, but five years ago, a study out of Johns Hopkins demonstrated that some S. I. cases are actually deaths from breathing superheated air.
how hot is superheated? - It instantly sears your airways, causing death long before smoke and flame. What does this mean for Rick?
the fire in the Sullivan home was too hot to be caused by acetone alone.
the arson unit determined that acetone was the only fire accelerant, and the D. A.'s case hinged on that point. They were wrong.
I thought you'd be more pleased. - Oh, I'm...
I guess I was pretty sure I'd be walking away from this.
well, my findings do not absolutely exclude Rick as a suspect.
no, but it's enough to make me glad I didn't tell him I wouldn't help him.
Thanks. I'm sure Rick would say thank you if he could.
well, I'm glad, but I'm doing this for you.
I have confirmed these are the most up-to-date lists on flash points and flame temperatures for flammable chemicals.
great. I'm ready to get started. Well, thank you for doing this on the weekend.
I really do need your expertise to run this fire-simulation program.
no problem. I'd much rather be here than at home being mad at myself for not going sightseeing.
using the crime-scene photos, I created a digital replica of the Sullivan house, focusing on the hallway.
this is the simulation for 100% acetone.
exactly as I expected. The flame temperature doesn't rise above 390 degrees, and that's just not hot enough to generate superheated smoke.
any thoughts on what it could be? - Mhm. Let's try ether.
its flame temperature is high ... about 3, 500 degrees.
that's too hot. That would result in more charring than what we saw in the crime-scene photos.
there are no hardwood floors in their house.
it's all carpet and linoleum. Wait a minute.
it's not that the chemist didn't find the other accelerant.
it's that he misunderstood what it was.
I'm sorry...? - The answer that we need ...
it was in this report all along.
Hey. - About Korsak's case...
how about "hello. How are you?
hello. And about Korsak's case...
what do you know about it?
Frankie, there's no time for that. Listen.
Rick was a suspect because he had two motives to kill his wife ...
one, she was having an affair.
two, she had a life-insurance policy. - Okay.
well, motive was moved to the back burner when they found acetone on his pants, which means that no one confirmed who Tanya's boyfriend was.
so he couldn't be eliminated as a suspect.
wait. How do you know any of this?
you haven't been cleared ... Just find the boyfriend.
Hey. Hot pastrami.
Oh, I could think of nothing else.
the original chemist tested 38 materials inside the Sullivan home...
drywall, door sills, fabric, foam, plastic ...
are you gonna list all the materials he tested? Yes.
this is usually when Jane says, "get to the point
before she's overcome with an urge to strangle me with her bare hands. - I miss her.
the chemist found, uh, substantial amounts of acetone, as well as traces of other chemicals that he discounted as burn-off.
meaning the stuff left behind from everything that melted in the fire?
Yes. And one of those discounted chemicals was toluene, a solvent.
but it would only have been present as a burn-off if the Sullivans had hardwood floors.
which they didn't. - Exactly.
so, the D. A. was wrong about there being only one fire accelerant, which is why we need to retest Rick's clothes for the presence of toluene.
if you don't find any, how does that prove Rick didn't set the fire?
the acetone and toluene had to have been poured from a single container.
otherwise, we would be seeing two burn patterns, not one.
so it would be impossible for Rick to get splattered with one chemical and not the other?
and when we test his jeans, if there's no toluene...
we have forensic proof that Rick is innocent.
on a scale of 1 to 10, how happy are you you didn't tell him to buzz off?
homicide cases ...
Tanya Sullivan and Becky Sullivan? - Right.
these aren't your cases, Vince.
they're not even open. - I know.
just grab the files for me, will you? - Sure, just as soon as I get the okay from the lead detective and the D. A.
two signatures, easy-peasy. That's BPD-2410 and 2413.
what? - I need the files now.
Oh, no. Everything is time-stamped.
once I get the forms... - You will.
...and then you'll get the files. - A guy is dying in prison.
we're all dying, Vince. Oh, come on, Smitts.
do the right thing here. - I am. I'm following the rules.
so forms and procedures and time stamps ... they're more important than justice?
didn't say that. - Yes, you did.
don't forget to wash it first. - But it says "prewashed.
Really?
Hello?
evidence lockup won't play ball and give us the jeans.
we need the evidence to get the D. A.'s permission, but we need the D. A.'s permission to get the evidence.
well, talk about a Catch-22. - Smitts won't budge at all?
Oh, he doesn't know the meaning of the word.
like he ate a rule book, and it got stuck in his colon. That's not how digestion works.
I know, but you asked me to be more delicate when I say, "that guy's got a rule book stuck up his...
I got nothing. - Well, there's got to be someone who can go over this guy's head.
Oh. Nobody's gonna put their ass on the line for a guy like Rick.
so, after all this, it just comes down to a heartless bureaucracy?
Yeah, I-I guess. I guess it does.
Tanya Sullivan had a boyfriend?
uh, I mean, uh, if ... if she had a boyfriend, then that would be a new lead. Am I right?
if Rick not guilty ...
that should say "isn't guilty.
uh, "the real arsonist had a motive.
the real arsonist had a motive.
you know what? Those are my good cloth napkins.
can't you just write on a piece of paper like a normal person?
you took files out of the box, didn't you?
what do you mean? What does he mean?
not many.
I should be mad that you ignored department policy, but sometimes your blatant disregard for the rules works to my advantage. Tell me what you got.
apology accepted.
Jane was right.
Tanya Sullivan got arrested a few weeks before the fire.
she was in an altercation in a bar, but the charges were dropped.
I tracked down every witness in the report.
anybody got a good memory? - Uh, one person remembered
Tanya was with a guy who went by "Sal.
short for...? - Salvador Briglio.
he's 15 years older now, but the description the witness gave still matches.
how'd you get him?
uh, I just cross-referenced variations of the name "Sal" with parking tickets issued near the bar where Tanya got arrested.
so he's a regular? - Five to six nights a week.
and he ran his mouth off a lot, too.
one person overheard Sal warning Tanya to sleep with one eye open.
he said he was gonna kill her and her loser husband.
how long before the fire was that? - Uh, a few weeks.
it was probably a breakup fight. Tanya told him to get lost.
I'll bet he hated losing Tanya to a drunk like Rick.
well, the year of the fire,
Sal worked at a full-service marina in Falmouth.
guess which chemicals are used in deck paint and boat maintenance.
acetone and toluene. - Yep.
I think this could be our guy.
I was very impressed with your work yesterday.
Oh, I just hit some computer keys. You did the hard part.
I'm sure thankful I don't wear that getup anymore.
polyester chafes like you wouldn't believe.
is it pure polyester? Not even a blend?
pure. - Ooh.
detective Rizzoli. Great to have you back at work.
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not back at work.
Oh. Well, you look fantastic anyway.
thank you, Nina.
you look ... not like you at all.
Yeah. What's the vibe you're getting?
like... stuffy, uptight, professional?
wait a minute. That's ... that's my suit.
and what do you mean, "stuffy"? And that's my blouse.
well, I didn't think you would mind.
I've never seen you wear this outfit. Well, because it isn't an outfit.
that blouse is eveningwear, and the suit is for work, which is why the skirt is knee-length.
or, at least, it's supposed to be. Okay, Jane, what's really going on here?
what do you mean?
why are you dressed like a flight attendant? First of all, I'm dressed like a librarian.
I'm wearing glasses on a chain, for god's sake.
have you ever checked out a book? Well, have you ever been on a plane?
because that scarf you're wearing screams, "in the event of a water landing, your seat cushion can also be used as a floatation device.
that better? - Much.
good. I got to be 100% librarian if I'm gonna pull this off.
pull what off? What just happened?
Wow. I haven't heard the name Tanya Sullivan in years.
were you romantically involved with her? Sure. I was involved with a lot of women back then.
Tanya was arrested at a bar a few weeks before she died.
you know why? - Long time ago.
15 years. But a lot of people still remember your fight with Tanya that night.
what was it he said, again? "I'll kill you. I'll kill you both ... you and that loser.
and my personal favorite, "sleep with one eye open, you bitch.
that's pretty vivid stuff, Sal. - I was a hothead.
I said a lot of stupid stuff. I didn't mean it.
sounded pretty mad. - I treated Tanya like a queen.
her husband treated her like garbage, but she cuts me loose so she can work on her marriage.
look where that got her. Yeah, let's look at where that got her.
she burned to death in the middle of the night with her 7-year-old daughter.
did you know her kids were in the house? Did you care?
I didn't know because I didn't do this.
I wasn't even there. - Yeah, where were you?
on a fishing boat with four other guys, 247 for a week.
names and numbers.
you know, I don't even know why you're bothering with this, man.
excuse me? - Rick Sullivan set that fire, and nobody who knew him has any doubt about that.
sit tight, Sal.
uh, thanks. His alibi's airtight.
he was 40 miles offshore ... the Susan Marie.
I'm sorry. You okay? - We got a guy sitting in jail for a crime we don't think he committed.
pretty far from okay.
Thanks. D. A.'s at a fundraiser in Cambridge.
why don't I talk to him, and you try and wrangle the other signature we need to get the jeans released?
why don't you just test them now?
Oh, I know. Get it all out ...
rules, policy, blah, blah, blah. - No, no, no, no, no.
right now, I'm just so grateful that you're so stubborn you don't care about getting fired.
I could get fired? - Department rule 110, section 27 ...
officers on medical leave.
you're learning a lot studying for that test. This is ... this is just between us, right?
how did you get Smitts to give you the jeans?
what ... you didn't see the wall calendar with all the sexy women chewing on their glasses?
last month was the librarian.
no? And you call yourselves "detectives.
there is acetone on Rick's jeans. We knew that from the original test.
however, there are no other chemical signatures that can connect him to the fire ... specifically, toluene.
well, if the acetone didn't get on Rick from starting the fire, where did it come from?
I pulled up his medical records, and the night of the fire,
Rick was taken to the emergency room and treated for nausea and stomach pains.
from smoke inhalation. I thought so, too, until I read the lab results.
Rick has a condition called alcoholic ketoacidosis.
can you take maalox for that? - Not quite.
heavy drinking caused his body to produce an excess of acetone.
the only way for the body to rid itself of the acetone is through urination. Paragraph two.
the test sample contained a strong concentration of acetone, uric acid, and ammonia.
urine? - Correct.
so the acetone on his pants isn't from starting a fire.
I can't wait to see the look on the D. A.'s face when I show him this ...
that our proof that Rick Sullivan didn't kill his family is that he pissed his pants.
Jason Sullivan? Sergeant Detective Korsak, Boston homicide.
Oh, my god. Did something happen to my wife? My son?
no, no, no, no. They're fine.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.
um, what's this about, then? - Your father.
I hope you've come to tell me that he's dead.
no. There's new evidence that could exonerate him.
is this new evidence gonna bring back my mother and my sister?
look, Jason, I know that's a terrible loss, but it's not something I believe your father did.
just leave me alone, sergeant. - I know it's hard to take it in.
no, what's hard to take was having a father who drank away his paycheck and tried to kill his entire family.
you want me to believe he didn't do it?
you show me the guy who did.
Hey, Ma.
Hi. How come you're dressed like a... flight attendant?
librarian.
playing dress-up ... it's kind of strange, but, you know, when you're bored and have nothing else ...
I went to headquarters, Ma. I had to help out Korsak.
you, uh ... you really love your job, don't you?
when are you gonna get it? I love what I do.
this came for you two days ago.
is that from the department doctor? - Yeah.
you hid this from me? - I wasn't ready for you to go back.
well, that's not your decision, Ma.
I know, and I-I hate it. I hate this whole thing.
I hate the fact that you have a job where you can get hurt so easily.
I don't even know if I'm cleared, so...
I steamed it open.
no. - You can go back in two days.
Yes! Ma! Thank you.
Ohh, thank you. - Oh, yeah, "wonderful news.
that's just wonderful. - Oh, come on.
I'm ready. - Well, I'm not, Jane.
I fixed you up, and now you're gonna go back out there, and ... and I'm gonna stay here and worry.
not tonight.
okay? Come on. Tonight, it's just ...
it's just you and me, all right?
and ... and we'll ... we'll watch a movie, and we'll sit here on the couch, and you can massage my feet if you want to, even though I hope you don't.
come on. What do you want to watch?
I'm gonna go make some grilled cheese.
I love you, Ma. - Well, you're only saying that because you're getting your way.
do you understand what I just said?
I might be able to convince the D. A. to overturn the conviction.
did you talk to Jason? - Yes.
What'd he say?
all right. Don't get me wrong, Vince.
I'd love to get out of here.
it's just that ... the only jury I care about is my son.
if he still thinks I'm guilty, then I'm guilty.
but I appreciate it. Thank you.
you're a better man than I remember.
that was the D. A. - He'll reopen the case?
if we come up with more than 15-year-old jeans. You come up with anything?
uh, I talked to a lot of people who didn't like Rick.
bartenders, owner of the liquor store, a bunch of people he owed money to.
any of them look good for the arson?
no, they're all regular people ... working stiffs.
none of them would have set fire to his house.
still, Jane's right. Somebody had to have a motive to kill Rick and his family.
I'll recanvass, talk to the neighbors.
Ah, maybe time loosened up a few tongues.
sorry, detective. We didn't buy the house until after the fire.
Yeah, in fact, the fire was a blessing of sorts.
you know a woman and her daughter died in that fire?
that's not what my husband meant.
it's just that, well, we drove by the day after, just to check it out. - Yeah.
to see if there was potential to rebuild and maybe make a better offer than the insurance company?
Yes, but when we got here, we saw the sign in the window of the house next door.
Yeah, no realtor ... just a number. In fact, the seller didn't even negotiate.
just accepted our first offer over the phone. The owner wanted to make a quick sale?
Yeah, I guess. He never even showed up to the closing.
remember that? He just gave our lawyer a power of attorney.
do you remember that guy's name? - Melvin Tuttle.
he's got a few felony assault and battery charges, but mostly drug stuff ... for cooking and selling crystal meth.
field interrogationobservation reports show Melvin was associating with a local biker gang ... the Devil's Scorpions.
sounds like a typical outlaw-biker drug operation.
the scorpions supply the chemicals. - And Melvin cooks the meth.
still ... it doesn't explain why Melvin sells his house and takes off right after the fire...
unless he was responsible for it in some way.
we'll never know. Six weeks after the fire,
Melvin Tuttle was stabbed to death in Jacksonville, Florida.
man Stabbed to Death Near Jacksonville Landing - Melvin Tuttle might have burned the house down, but why would he? - I don't think he did.
I mean, come on. The guy takes off to Florida. He's dead six weeks later?
I'm betting he ran because somebody was after him. How long until Melvin's homicide file gets here?
Jacksonville's digging it out of cold cases.
said they'd overnight it to us. - All right.
well, we can keep working while we wait. Is it possible they were in business together?
I could recheck the forensics and see if I can identify any meth by-products in the Sullivan house.
we need to nail down a connection between Rick and Melvin Tuttle.
Yeah, and figure out why someone wanted them both dead.
I'm gonna go back and work with Frankie and Nina.
I will see you tomorrow at BPD, detective.
see you tomorrow.
you got anything?
uh, the drug unit has plenty on Melvin Tuttle. Nothing on Rick Sullivan.
what about phone records and incident reports?
we're still checking. - There's nothing yet.
I didn't want to break the rules and show up early.
what have you two been doing?
we're looking at old drug-unit surveillance videos. We've pulled the ones where Melvin was tagged.
we're looking for any sign that he and Rick knew each other.
any luck? - Not so far.
okay, let's ... let's look at the next one. This is three days before the fire.
that's the 1310 ... headquarters for the Scorpions.
they are not too happy with Melvin.
wait, wait. Pause that.
is that Rick's truck?
Nina, run a DMV check on Rick Sullivan.
DMV doesn't keep records that far back. I'll check the department of revenue.
what? - Massachusetts charges a road tax on all vehicles registered.
enjoy that when you buy a car. Well, Rick drove a red Chevy 1500.
okay, that's a Ford.
Nina, pull up the exterior crime-scene photo from the fire.
Rick's red pickup truck in his driveway.
it's almost the same color as Melvin's.
they live right next door to each other, and both own red pickup trucks.
so someone wanted Melvin Tuttle dead.
when they went to kill him, they burned down the wrong house.
ma, today should be an easy day. Yeah, you're just saying that for my sake.
no, no, I'm not, really.
we're waiting on a homicide file from Florida.
all I'm gonna do today is ... is paperwork. That's it.
you ready, Ma?
I feel the same as I did on your first day of school ...
sending you out into a world where I can't be there to take care of you.
and I was fine that day, and I'll be fine today.
no, you came home missing a front tooth, - fighting with that Murphy boy. - Well, he started it.
besides, that tooth was loose, anyway.
you could always take care of yourself, Jane.
go ahead. Go and knock 'em dead.
I'm a homicide detective, Ma. They're already dead.
don't be a smartass!
all right. That ... I can't move my arms. Let me go.
I know. - Hey!
I love you. - I love you, too.
I'll see you later.
Hey, Janie.
good to have you back... officially.
Yeah, we missed you. - I missed you guys.
Oh, it's good to be back.
okay, um, did that file come in from Jacksonville?
two motorcycles were seen leaving the area of the Tuttle murder.
witness saw a gold stripe on the gas tank and cowboy-style saddlebags on one.
no description of the other bike. And I found this in the organized crime unit files.
what are the chances that two motorcycles look just like that?
it depends. Are we going to the gold-stripe and saddlebag store?
Henry "Blade" Vallenhurst.
Oh, he was president of the Devil's Scorpions.
I doubt burning down the wrong house would stop him from killing Melvin.
Jacksonville homicide said there were two motorcycles.
he had an accomplice. - So, the question is, who did he trust enough to help him kill Melvin Tuttle?
florida is coming for you, Blade...
...for the murder of Melvin Tuttle.
you're talking out your ass.
well, my "ass" found two collect calls that you made from a motel in Jacksonville the same night that Melvin was murdered.
we sent your photo down to the locals. One person identified you.
he even remembered your scorpion tattoo.
we know you didn't do it alone, so further research turned over another collect call, uh, from the same room, same date... from this guy.
robert Kincade, fellow Scorpion.
he's doing 10 years in Walpole on a drug beat because he turned down an offer to testify against you.
and he won't say anything now. - We thought the same thing.
however, we managed to convince him what a solid case Florida had against him, and it seems like your pal Kincade can't really stomach the idea of 2, 200 volts of electricity popping his eyeballs out of his head.
so I made him an offer ... his life for yours.
now, here's the thing.
I don't really care about Melvin or Kincade.
I care about the fire that killed Tanya and Becky Sullivan.
so you own up to what you did.
you confess to setting the Sullivan house on fire.
you're not following. Okay...
and as much as I hate it ...
florida can't execute you if you're doing life here.
that damn red truck.
what were the odds?
Yeah, "what were the odds?
you just have to walk me through what happened.
my father's innocent?
he's been telling the truth.
thank you.
the D. A. filed a motion to overturn the verdict.
what does that mean?
that means in two days, your father will be a free man.
okay.
Cheers.
so, is my mother boycotting my big send-off?
no, she actually went out dancing. But she sends her love.
I'm sorry. Did you say she went dancing?
I did. She is. - Hold on.
where? W-With who? - She didn't say.
you didn't ask? - Well, Angela is a grown woman.
Yes, but she can't be out clubbing in the middle of the night. It's 9: 30.
Oh, Maura, don't hassle me with the details.
my mother is missing. - Okay.
I know that it's scary, but Angela has to leave the nest and spread her wings.
that's good advice...
if we were talking about a cockatoo, which we are not.
my mother has dated two men her entire life, both of whom I knew very well.
I think we all know how that turns out, don't we?
I can't believe you would bring that up. I can't believe you're not concerned about my mother.
do I need to pull up your booking photo?
I think we both know that your mother is okay.
Yeah.
so you're just gonna wait up for her? - Well, I can't sleep now.
you got me luggage.
they're made with three-ply durable plastic, and they even have a ziplock and handles.
it's perfect. - I was gonna get you a stick with a bandana on the end of it, but then I thought that was too hobo-chic.
thank you. - You're welcome.
so, should we order a pizza? We might be waiting up for a while.
well, you don't have to. I'm sure you're exhausted.
no, I-I doubt I could sleep either.
what time is it now? - 9: 36.
what time do we start calling hospitals?
not until later ... after 10: 00.
18991231 0: 10: 05
raising my mother's a lot harder than I thought.
slippers for the stubborn.
mules.
morning. - Good morning. Coffee?
Yeah, I'd love some, but we have a dead girl in Kenmore Square.
we do? Oh.
my phone must have been off.
Hi, Jack.
morning, Jane.
he knows he can come out here, right?
well, he can't, actually, until he finds his pants.
I've looked everywhere. - Nice.
and on a school night, no less. Mm.
ladies.
Hey. - Hey.
Maura, is Thursday still good to bring Allie by?
I'm looking forward to it. - Great.
see you, Jane. - Mm.
good ... Good luck with your pants. Don't you think that was a little terse?
I'm sorry. Men in kimonos make me uncomfortable.
kimono.
it's a generic word, like "clothing." There's no plural.
and it's suitable for both men and women.
you know, in Japan, wearing a kimono is called kitsuke.
in America, we call it "walk of shame."
do us all a favor. Buy the man some jammies. Come on.
wait. Who's Allie? - Jack's daughter.
her seventh-grade class is doing a career study project, and she wants to shadow me for extra credit.
that's pretty grown up for a seventh grader.
what do you mean by "grown up"? - Boring.
well, do you doubt my abilities to make forensics fun?
did you hear that sentence that just came out of your face?
well, if conversation lags, I'll vamp.
I'll talk about things that interested me at that age.
such as? - My favorite books.
or, you know, when I was her age,
I did a science project on the antimicrobial properties of common foods.
garlic gets the most press, but the cruciferous family is not to be underestimated.
so, your plan "B" is "Anne of green gables" or broccoli.
good luck with that.
let me guess. 20-something? - How do you know?
is there a law that requires people to decorate their first apartments with the same five posters?
10 bucks there's a "Breakfast at Tiffany's" poster on the wall in her bedroom.
Oh, you cannot know that. - Want to bet?
taste is an individual's preference based on their specific cultural experience.
it is impossible to predict. - No, no, no, wait.
Marilyn Monroe, white dress, on the subway grate.
20 bucks. - Deal.
Yes! Pay up, baby. - Maybe after.
all right, but don't think I'm gonna forget. What do we know?
no forced entry. Doesn't look like she was robbed.
the neighbors didn't hear anything last night. Anybody know what time she came home?
guy across the hall works a night shift, said she got in late, couldn't tell if she was with anybody, though.
rigor shows time of death around midnight, and lividity indicates she was moved into this position.
well, the bag does suggest asphyxia, but I'll need to confirm it with the lab.
it's a pretty tidy crime scene, especially for somebody who's been strangled.
well, CSRU couldn't pull a print off anything.
it would take time to wipe the surfaces clean.
killer wasn't in a hurry, like they knew nobody was coming home.
look how she's laid out and how deliberate it is. Like they knew what they were doing.
makes me think it's because they've done it before.
you owe me 20 bucks, Dr. Isles. - It is on my desk.
but just for the record,
I do want to say that I think you are underestimating the merit of Danielle's posters.
what? You mean you're gonna get like a Bob Marley mosaic in y... No!
keep calm and buy shoes.
Ooh, that's good. I haven't heard that one.
well, I'm not talking about taste. I'm talking about the evolutionary basis for cultural trends.
there is no evolutionary basis for beer hats and foam fingers.
imitation is a survival strategy.
you know, the viceroy butterfly imitates the appearance of the less-palatable monarch, thereby deterring predators and ensuring survival.
for butterflies.
my point is that being unoriginal can have its advantages.
not for Danielle.
petechial hemorrhaging confirms that the cause of death was asphyxiation.
Yeah, that's what we were saying was the M. O. in our NCIC search.
anything so far? - Eh, a few strangulations, a few girls in Danielle's demographic, but nothing that can prove that this was a repeat killing.
I need a special detail that can link her to the other victims.
okay. Uh...
Yeah, "Hess, Jasmine."
found dead in Plymouth County about six months ago.
she was strangled, laid out on her bed.
Oh, no, no, her case is unique.
the M. E. ... - Found a cork in her throat. - Well, it looks like there's something to your theory of imitation after all.
imitation? What makes you think it's not the same person?
because the guy that did this murder is already in jail.
this side is the Plymouth County case, and this side is Danielle.
two girls killed the same way by two different people.
assuming they got the right guy in the first case, this is either a coincidence or a copycat.
tell me about our girl. Well, she worked as a waitress in the Back Bay.
her credit card records are all pretty normal.
largest expense is a hotel reservation for next month in Hawaii.
probably would have been a nice vacation.
do we know who she was going with? - Still working on it.
other than that, no serious debt, no weird activity.
what about the Plymouth County victim?
we find any connection between them? - Well, they're about the same age, but they didn't appear to know each other, no shared interests, no mutual friends, No connections at all.
except they both wound up strangled with a cork in their throat.
Ah, except that.
in the trial records, the original killer had dated the victim.
now, he said the cork was his way to shut her up after she tried to dump him, "I put a cork in it."
subtle. Maybe Danielle had a boyfriend who used the cork killing as inspiration?
possibly, but nobody in her building saw her with anyone.
well, let's talk to her friends and co-workers.
if there was a guy in her life, somebody knew about him.
already on it.
there is a connection between these girls. We just have to find it.
so sad.
we were supposed to work a shift together tonight.
what can you tell me about Danni?
she was sweet... fun.
we worked every weekend together. We used to hang out after closing all the time.
you used to? - Before the Package entered the picture.
what's "the package"? - We think he was her boyfriend.
she stopped hanging out, was always on her phone during breaks, except out in the alley instead of in the back where the rest of us took calls.
it was like some big secret.
when did that start? - A couple of months ago.
all she ever said about him was "he's the total package."
we teased her a lot about that. And she never even told you his name?
no. I just thought he was into something illegal or married.
do you think she was with him the other night?
I really don't know.
but if he did do this, I really hope you catch him.
Oh, man.
I never got the appeal of rhinestones on phones.
nothing wrong with a little bling. - Come on. It looks like Hello Kitty threw up on My Little Pony.
you were saying?
is that your...?
well, in ... you know, in ... that bling is ...is quite tasteful. You know, in ... in this context, - I find that I am, uh, pro-bling. - You're pro-bling?
bring on the bling.
I could do your phone. - Would you?
if your victim was taking calls out in the alley, they were either to her mom or the cable company.
there are no mystery numbers that point to a boyfriend. What about her hard drive?
I cross-referenced the pictures on her phone and computer with the friends in her social-media network.
she's got a lot of friends, but no one that looks like our mystery man.
she was a lot less active online the last six months, fewer posts. If she did have a new boyfriend ...
she didn't want anybody to know about it.
come on, Danni. Where are you hiding this guy?
there are a few password-protected files on her hard drive that I haven't cracked yet.
any guesses? Did she have a pet cat or something?
people do that ... pet names?
pets, their own birthdays, and the ever-popular "password.
you're kidding. - Nope.
but I've tried all of those. Try "package."
newspaper clippings. Every one is on the Plymouth County murder trial.
why the sudden fascination with a creepy murder trial?
she did password-protect the file with her boyfriend's nickname.
and the co-worker said they met a few months ago. That's when the trial started.
her boyfriend's gonna get her wrapped up in this trial and he's gonna kill her the same way?
if that was his plan, it would explain why he wanted her to keep their relationship secret.
it's a weird plan. - Murderers are weird.
is it possible the prosecution got the wrong guy and Danni was involved with the real killer?
Vince! What a surprise.
I'm meeting Angela for lunch. Would you like to join us?
Oh, thanks. I was just leaving, actually.
are you sure? - What do you think of this place?
how do you mean? - Just in general.
what would you say about it if someone asked your opinion?
too many sprouts.
Hi, Vince. We need to talk.
Oh, Jane. I didn't know you were joining us.
I'm here under protest. - She's here to back me up.
you have a problem, and, fortunately, I can help you.
I might have accidentally told her that you are meeting Jack's daughter tomorrow.
I am sorry.
why is that a problem? - It isn't, as long as she likes you.
you have to impress her. - Okay, so, what do you suggest?
practice talking about things that interest young girls.
I can do that.
I can! Okay, try me.
what are your thoughts about "Pretty Little Liars"?
I don't think it's good to lie whether you're pretty or little.
do you know who, uh, Lady Antebellum is? - Is that a person?
how about Lady Gaga?
I am more familiar with "Lady and the Tramp."
okay, this is worse than I thought.
look, I took these from my nail salon.
get busy. - How is anyone supposed to retain this?
well, pretend that they're all dead if you have to.
but if you want to hit it off with Allie, don't stop until you know the difference between J. Lo, Cee Lo, and L-M-F-A-O.
what?
anything? - I've combed through every website Danni clicked on in the last year. Nothing unusual.
the only chat room she was in was in a discussion about making meringue.
it's a delicate process. - Mnh.
so, unless the boyfriend was pastry chef, we have no idea how she met him.
or how he factored into the Plymouth County case.
no leads from her parents?
no. They said she was chronically single.
and we have no other suspects, so this boyfriend is our guy, whoever he is.
I think I got something. We think there's a connection between the boyfriend and the case, right?
what we don't know is, did the boyfriend spark her interest...
or was she interested in the case and that's what led her to the boyfriend?
Yeah. Either way, I figure somebody who collected every article about the case might have actually gone down to the courthouse and watched the trial herself.
so you pulled security footage.
for the whole trial. Look.
she's there every day. She comes out at recess...
...Sends out some texts, and goes back inside. She's always alone.
Nina, who is she texting? - It's got to be the boyfriend.
no record of texts matching the time stamps on this footage.
cause that's not her phone. The pink bedazzled... That's right here.
this is just a plain black phone. - Burner, maybe?
Yeah, that's why we have no records ...
she had a separate phone for him.
we ... we got to see what number she's texting.
okay, a reverse lookup should give us a name.
that can't be right.
her boyfriend is the Plymouth County prosecutor.
start from the beginning, slowly.
our dead girl... - Danni.
...Danni, who was killed in the same way as the Plymouth County victim, also happens to be the girlfriend of the guy who prosecuted the Plymouth County case.
okay. - Prosecutor is Paul Wescourt.
conviction put him on the map.
he's been a rising star in the D. A.'s office ever since.
he is also very married. - Okay.
you ... You keep saying "okay," and, to me, it seems like the opposite of "okay."
well, I'm gonna ask a question that I don't really want to ask.
do we suspect him?
well, we can't rule him out, not until we talk to him.
I need to caution you against jumping to conclusions too early.
okay. - I'm trying to protect our relationship with the neighboring prosecutor's office.
paul Wescourt has a sterling reputation and is, by all accounts, a good guy.
a good guy who cheats on his wife.
we're investigating a homicide here. We're not blowing up people's lives. I know going easy on a suspect for political reasons is not your style.
that's one way to put it. - Hence my concern about your ability to control your face.
I... I have excellent face control.
even with lying, cheating husbands.
Oh, yeah. You're like Buddha on the lotus.
shut up. Traitor.
cool ringtone.
are you talking? - I-I thought I recognized that ringtone.
is that Katy Perry? - No.
I can see why she thought that, though.
Yeah, it's kind of like "Roar," right?
goodbye to the Tiger
that's not how it goes.
Oh, it isn't? - Forget it.
two cupcakes, please.
Oh, girls, before you leave, I ...
well, I'm doing some field research, and I was wondering if you could tell me how I could have made a better impression on you.
what do you mean? - Well, you know, just some tips, like, - was I too pushy or too forced? - Too close.
Oh. - And needy.
great feedback.
thank you. - Oh, my gosh.
thank you. Hey, detectives. Paul Wescourt.
Mr. Wescourt. Vince Korsak. - Pleasure.
and you must be Detective Rizzoli. Yeah. Thanks for coming down so quickly.
not at all. The grand jury will still be there in the morning.
what can I do for you? Please sit down.
we need to talk to you about Danielle Mitchell. It's ...
it's not good news, I'm afraid.
well, i-is she okay?
she was found yesterday in her apartment.
she was strangled to death. - No. No, not Danni.
no, there's go... got to be a mistake.
I'm sorry. We need to ask you about the nature ...
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
well...
I-I guess you know that D-Danni and I were romantically involved.
when did it start? - Uh... a few months ago.
listen, y-you're ...
you're gonna find evidence at the autopsy if you haven't already.
we were together ... what was it? ... t-two nights ago.
Yeah, w-w-we were together.
would you be willing to submit a DNA sample - so we can confirm that? - Of course.
can you tell us what time you left her apartment? I-I wasn't in her apartment.
look, we realize this is difficult for you, politically.
but the more truthful you can be with us now, - the better this whole thing will go. - I've never been there.
she ... she had neighbors with ... with cameras.
we w-were careful. - Burner phone?
Yeah, and ... and meetings were all pre-arranged, and, um, we used to meet at a hotel just around the corner from where she lived.
she would walk home afterward. - What time did she leave the hotel?
around 11: 00. Yeah, I-I spent the night there.
I-I went home in the morning. We're gonna need the name of that hotel.
there's no easy way to ask this, but could you... leave my wife out of it?
sh-she didn't know about Danni. She would be devastated.
well, that seems more on you than on us.
Yeah, you're right. But I'm a public figure.
and... she doesn't deserve this. Please.
we'll keep it quiet for now. - Thank you.
I-I-I could use a minute. - Of course.
well, he copped to the affair right away. I'll give him that.
he might be a cheater, but he doesn't seem like a killer.
you say that 'cause you want it to be true.
well, if he did kill our girl, it'll be a mess for our department, the prosecutor's office, in the press.
so, yes, I want him to be as innocent as he claims to be.
I want to check his alibi.
you're telling me you don't have a reservation list or a guest log?
I'm not saying we don't have one.
I'm saying that some of our guests prefer not to be in it, - and we honor that. - What about credit-card records?
we take credit cards, but, again, some of our guests prefer ...
pay cash. Yeah. Security cameras?
they don't record. - Right.
do you recognize him? - No.
would you tell me if you did?
look, my ... my clients are very private people.
my whole business depends on my discretion.
what you call discretion I call obstruction of a criminal investigation.
now, I need to know if this guy stayed here two nights ago.
security logs license plates of guests parked in the garage overnight.
it's the best I can do. - Better than nothing.
looks like Wescourt's car was at the hotel the night of the murder.
well, that's a good alibi, right?
for his car. Why do people cheat?
I mean, i-is there some sort of evolutionary reason?
well, there is research that links infidelity to a variant in dopamine receptor D4.
some call it the thrill-seeking gene. - So, cheating is genetic?
the variant is genetic, but the behavior can be modulated by the individual, though not in this case, apparently.
the semen was a match to the DNA swab that Paul Wescourt submitted. - Which we expected.
there's more. Because the surfaces were wiped,
CSRU had to take extra-thorough measures at the scene, and they pulled the drain stopper out of the shower.
gross. - But worth it.
they recovered hair, which I did a DNA profile on.
some of it was Danni's.
some of it was Wescourt's.
so, Paul Wescourt's hair is in a shower drain of an apartment that he claims to have never been in.
and the DNA test is conclusive. - Well, why would he lie about this?
he told us the truth about the affair. Maybe he thought he'd covered all of his tracks.
and if he is lying, that brings everything he's said into question.
how can we even know if their relationship was consensual?
it's almost impossible to prove forensically.
not to mention the previous case.
I mean, this guy could have done both murders and put away an innocent man.
well, it is possible that the hair was carried in on Danni's body and wound up in the drain when she showered.
it seems unlikely. - That's what I said, Which is why I sent CSRU back to the scene.
and this time, they got a print.
want to guess whose it was? - So, his mistress is dead, his prints are at the scene, and his alibi is paper-thin.
did he think he would just lie to our faces and get away with it?
let's go ask him, shall we? - Yes, let's.
detectives. What a surprise.
I thought we agreed to discretion. I thought you agreed to tell us the truth.
can we, uh, talk somewhere else?
we found your DNA at the crime scene. Would you like to come with us?
should we do the whole perp-walk thing?
hello.
Mrs. Wescourt, hello. I'm Detective Rizzoli.
this is Sergeant Korsak. Boston homicide.
sorry to barge in on you like this.
Oh, it's no problem. Would you like some coffee?
no, thank you.
we just need Paul to come with us. - Why? What happened?
it's nothing. It's a mistake. - Would you like for us to talk to your wife about the details of the case?
Carol, please go in the other room while I sort this out.
no. Somebody tell me what's going on this instant.
your husband is under arrest.
for homicide?
Paul... - Listen to me.
do not speak to anyone until you get Marty Ackerman on the phone. Do you understand?
Marty? You want me to call our lawyer? But you say only guilty people get lawyers.
Carol, please, I'm innocent.
this is a mistake. I'll make bail.
I'll be back by tonight. Please, Carol.
paul Wescourt, you're under arrest for the murder of Danielle Mitchell.
Oh, my...
Dr. Isles? - My friends call me Maura.
come on in, Allie. Can I get you anything?
never autopsy on an empty stomach, I always say.
uh, wow. - What do you mean by that?
I mean... this office is great.
I love tribal art... especially ritual masks of West Africa.
you do? The idea that when you put one on, you conceptually lose your human identity and become the spirit represented by the mask ...
I mean, it's the definition of cool.
you do not know how relieved I am to hear you say that.
um, why? - Oh, uh, well, I was ...
I was a little nervous that maybe we wouldn't have anything in common and you wouldn't enjoy hanging out with me.
you were worried about that? I tried on a few masks of my own, in fact.
Oh, please. But, you know, even though I should know better.
it's ... it's always best just to be yourself.
my mom says that. - I agree with her.
easier said than done sometimes. - Tell me about it.
it's really hard, trying to fit in.
that's part of the reason that I spend my day with dead people.
nice.
B. P.D. got a call about an altercation involving one of our suspects.
do you know what happened? - Nope.
but if he's being held here, technically, he's our suspect.
Ooh, isn't he helpful?
you got visitors, counselor.
you okay, Mr. Wescourt? - Yeah.
this man works in the D. A.'s office. He might as well have had a target on his back.
it's all right. Why wasn't he put in protective custody in the first place?
guess the way we see it, you kill your girlfriend, you don't get special treatment.
I'm sorry about this.
Oh, it's the least of my problems.
my lawyer has been calling Carol nonstop. She...
she won't bail me out. She won't talk to me.
she's probably pretty confused.
and the phones in my office go right to voicemail.
my staff have jumped ship. I'm alone.
apparently, my only friends are you two. Put me in here.
Oh, hey, you put yourself in here when you lied to us.
I didn't kill her! I was set up.
by who? How?
I don't know!
all I know is that I loved Danni.
and whoever did this to her is out there while I'm in here.
look who made bail.
guess the word is out. It's a zoo out there.
Ah, the press is calling him the "cutthroat lawyer," which is factually inaccurate.
catchy, though. I-I think we're gonna need to put up a barricade.
better do it quick. - Yeah.
nice job on the bruises.
a lady in processing took pity on me and loaned me some concealer.
well, I hope it holds up. You got a lot of press out there.
poor Carol.
you should have thought about that before. Let me ask you something.
are you as convinced of my guilt as I am of my innocence?
it's not about my certainty.
it's about evidence, and it's about facts, like the fact that you lied about being in Danni's apartment.
I know how it looks.
but I also know that I am innocent.
get back!
Mr. Wescourt! - There he is!
did you kill her? Can you tell us where you were that night?
was she your girlfriend?
can we get a statement? We just want to ask...
all right, come on. You can go through the morgue loading docks.
are you sure? - Yes. Come on.
all right, what was Danni's favorite color?
uh... sage. - Sage?
she liked to look at the pottery barn catalog.
there's a lot of sage in there.
what was her favorite food? - Samosas.
least-favorite food? - Shrimp. Okay?
sorry.
it wasn't a fling. I loved her.
well, then, why not just leave your wife?
I was trying to do the right thing for everyone.
Oh, I-I know how that sounds.
I just couldn't figure out an easy way to end things.
maybe there is no easy way.
maybe love always ends with someone getting hurt.
God, I hope not.
me, too. For your sake, anyway.
you still here?
he really loved her, Vince.
wouldn't be the first man to kill someone he loved.
and we don't have motive.
he's a married man with a high-profile job. Motive was probably what it always is he wanted out, she threatened to expose him. But she never even spoke his name to her friends.
and she encrypted files with articles about his case.
she wasn't trying to expose him. She was protecting him.
and look.
he's got a trip to Hawaii for a legal conference next month.
three days at the Hyatt.
Mm-hmm, but the plane ticket is for a week.
Where's he staying the rest of the time? Check out her credit-card records.
so that's who she was going on vacation with.
but why book a romantic getaway with a mistress you're planning to kill?
to make it look like you're not planning to kill her.
okay, say that's true. Why kill her this way,
I mean, in the exact manner of a case he just tried and won?
I mean, if he wanted to get rid of her that badly, just shoot her or push her off a cliff or something.
well, maybe he's a sociopath who wanted to get caught. It just doesn't feel right.
he lied about being in the apartment. His alibi is full of holes.
his prints were at the crime scene. It's a lot of evidence.
it's just... too perfect.
I know what the evidence says. I know what my gut says.
what's that? Reasonable doubt.
this is the area between Danni's apartment and the hotel.
it's like a mile. - 9/10 of a mile, to be exact.
take about 12 minutes to walk.
so he easily could have parked in the lot, walked to Danni's apartment, killed her, and headed back to the hotel to stay overnight.
nobody wants your gut to be right more than I do, but no matter how many times we go over it, - he still looks guilty. - All right, well, what about the hair?
can CSRU tell us exactly how much they found?
we can't say exactly how much washed away before we got to it, but that it was there at all...
he still looks guilty. - There's also the fingerprint.
that's where you got the print? - It was on the underside of the handle, which is why they missed it in the first sweep, - but it's a complete print. - Also an exact match.
can you blow that up?
we need to get back in that apartment.
guess who, according to a reliable source, is the definition of cool?
did you give Allie lipstick? - What?
her mother said something about her coming home with makeup on.
well, Allie mentioned that a lot of girls in school - have started wearing makeup. - Which her mother doesn't allow.
she mentioned that, and, um, I said that I agree with that rule.
but she is feeling the pressure just to fit in.
so you gave her lipstick. - Lip gloss. Just a little.
and I suggested that she try it on as a way to broach the subject with you.
but if I've overstepped my boundaries ...
what was that for?
for a week, I've known something was bugging her, and she wouldn't talk to me.
it has been killing me, not knowing what's going on.
it's hard to talk about. I remember being the odd man out.
mm, I don't believe that. - Well, believe it.
I was ... I think the technical term is "weird."
I kind of like weird.
you're not wearing the lip gloss you gave my daughter, are you? - No.
cause that would be a different kind of weird. Yeah.
I kind of ruined it. - Just a little bit.
okay. Okay, go. - Okay.
Reverse-thread nuts are always tricky.
if you turn the wrench the wrong direction, you can crack the porcelain.
sometimes I forget you're a plumber's daughter.
you know, I never thought I'd say this, but thank you, pop.
this handle does not belong with that toilet.
they're two different brands.
maybe the landlord replaced it. - Yeah, but the newer handles are usually plastic or stainless steel.
this one's brass. Look. - Hmm. Nice.
a little too nice for a landlord to spend money on.
what if that handle was somewhere else when Paul Wescourt touched it?
wouldn't take more than a wrench for someone to relocate it here. - The print was planted.
I'll talk to the super, verify he didn't replace this handle.
if you're right ... - I am. And so was Paul Wescourt.
he was set up.
we have new evidence in your husband's favor.
can you tell us where he is? - You don't know?
I assumed that's why you're here. The police are out looking for him right now.
what do you mean, the police?
how can you not know? This is all your fault!
slow down. Tell us what happened.
I haven't seen him since you arrested him. He just keeps leaving voicemail messages.
he's out of his mind.
all right, all right. What is he saying in the messages?
he's saying that ... that I ...that I don't deserve this, that he ... that he failed me.
I-I called the police after this one. This is the last time you'll hear from me.
you'll be better off if I put an end to this.
H-he's gonna kill himself. Not if we can find him first.
Maura, the suicides that come through your office ...
can you figure out how and where they occur?
most of them.
okay, can you use that information to figure out a place where someone like Wescourt might try it?
well, it's not a straightforward formula.
was he on medications? Did he have a history of depression?
the woman he loves is dead. His marriage is over.
his career is ruined. I think it's pretty safe to say the guy's depressed.
okay, I amplified the ambient noises from the messages he left.
so far, I've got what I think is a jet engine.
I'm not gonna drag you through the humiliation of a trial.
it's time I put an end to this.
he's by an airport.
I-I wish I could be a better man. You deserve that.
that sounds like gunfire to me. - Gunfire and jet engines.
I just want you to know how sorry I am. What is that?
this is all my fault. This is what I deserve.
what is that?
could be car tires on steel grating, maybe a bridge.
there's a firing range on Moon Island.
the narrows bridge leads straight to it.
and it's adjacent to the flight path at Logan.
remote bridge ... It's a perfect spot for a suicide.
you're not going alone. Well, Korsak and Frankie are at the courthouse.
then it's you and me.
that's his car.
Maura, stay here. I don't want to spook him.
Jane ... - No, I know this guy well, - enough to know he's not bluffing. - Be careful.
listen to me, okay? - You're wasting your time.
no, just ... just listen.
I know you were set up. And we can prove it.
so?
please w... wait. Wait. Wait.
okay, listen. I-I know that we said that there's no easy way to end things, but y...you can't do this, okay? You can't quit like this.
I ruined my marriage.
Danni's gone.
my life's over. - No. No, it isn't. Okay, j...
just... hang on a second, okay?
let me come down there. - Oh, Jane, don't.
I'll stay over here, all right?
we'll ... we'll ... we'll just talk from here.
okay? I'm not ...
I'm not moving any f... any further, all right?
I know that you think that your life is over, and ... and ... and maybe I can't change your mind on that, but just ... please, for one second ...
please, will you just think about Danielle?
Danni. - I know you didn't kill her.
okay? I ...
I-I think you loved her more than anything.
and I think that's why you... you were so conflicted about what to do.
and that's why you cannot let whoever did this to her get away with it, okay?
come on.
Paul, you said it yourself ... her killer is still out there.
look, I...
I ca... I can't bring Danni back.
okay? And ... and ...
I can't ... I can't give you any more nights flipping through catalogues and ... and ... and Indian food.
but ... but I can bring her killer to justice. I can do that.
okay? Please ... please h-help me do that.
doesn't she deserve that?
come on.
No!
to be continued...
a day, maybe two.
they're away and gone, Rob, and the beasts sold.
there's a wee glen on the other side of Ben Duh.
if I were tinkers with a two-day start, I'd lie out there and kill me some meat.
we'd not get there before dark, Rob.
not stood here, we won't.
you can smell them through the meat.
aye, if they fought as strong as they smelled, we'd be in trouble.
they're there right enough, just like you said, Rob.
we can rush them when they're asleep.
ten of them to six of us.
nine. One of them is a woman.
half of them would be dead before they were awake.
how are we going to take them, Rob?
I'll go and talk to them in the morning.
I'm getting too old for this, lying wet-arsed in the heather, chasing other men's cattle.
come away to the America with me.
they say there's fine acres for the clearing in Virginia.
aye, and they'll likely be as hard as these to sleep on.
why are you going in to talk to them?
I know one of them.
up!
get up, you bunch of ragged-arsed tinker cow thieves!
this is Robert Roy MacGregor come to reclaim the 32 beasts stolen from His Lordship James Graham, Marquis of Montrose.
tam Sibbald.
still at your thieving.
throw down now and I'll spare you, all but one.
there's a price to being a leader of men, Tam.
my God, MacGregor, if there's any killing to be done, you're the first.
who do you think you are, acting the great chief?
and I know you're a bigger thief than any of us.
aye, but if I had stolen His Lordship's cattle, you would not have come walking into my dreams so easy.
I can call the Gregorach and kill the half of you, or it can be between us and nothing more.
think on it, man.
would you not rather be dead this morning after a good hump and a belly full of stolen beef, or would you have me march you back to Montrose so you can shit yourself on the gallows a month hence?
throw down! Now!
and you have my word no one else will die!
come, lads.
and any man with a blade in his hands, cut him down.
are you men, or what are you?
he killed Tam, and you stand and live!
and him is as much an outlaw as any of you!
no man among you! Your mothers curse you!
you're spittle! You're leavings!
listen to me well, and remember this, or I'm going to remember you, every last one.
when next you think to steal cattle, have a care they're not under my protection.
but if they are, you're not stealing from their owners.
you're stealing from me, Robert Roy MacGregor.
and no man who steals my beasts makes a profit.
if you doubt me, ask Tam Sibbald.
what are you going to do with her?
be on your way, and tell no man you fared ill at our hands.
go on.
cut him down! Slash him!
go on.
ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the contest is Guthrie!
Montrose, come hotfoot from the court to the cockpit.
may I present Archibald Cunningham.
his Grace, the Duke of Argyll.
I am Your Grace's humble servant.
another of your likely lads?
Archibald is sent me by his mother, in the hope that our climate might cool the fever in his blood.
so, Mr. Cunningham, what are these principal sins that distress your mother?
dice? Drink?
or are you a buggerer of boys?
it is years, Your Grace, since I buggered a boy.
I thought him a girl at the moment of entry.
what say you, Guthrie, that Archie could not tell arse from quim?
I've heard that many Englishmen have that same difficulty.
spoken as well as you fought.
did you see Guthrie here at work, Mr. Cunningham?
he has a fair hand with the cleaver, it must be said.
you do not think much of our Highland tools, then?
if I had to kill an ox, a claymore would be my first choice, Your Grace.
you best use a musket and save the beast a slow dying.
I would not need a musket for you, Guthrie.
splendid!
I'll wager 100 of what you like on Guthrie and his cleaver.
at odds?
now, come, James, you're a fox. What odds?
three? - Two.
english pounds.
there's more of a jingle to Guineas.
guineas it is. - Excellent, excellent.
a bumper of Rhenish for my Lord Montrose and myself, and show Mr. Cunningham what blades we have.
you honor me, sir, to serve me with your own hand.
I tell you, James,
I forget how much you dislike me until I'm in your presence.
so, what news at court?
what else but the succession?
our poor queen cannot find the time to die in peace.
I fear she may pass over and leave the matter unresolved.
would that she had seen a child of hers live to comfort the kingdom.
Aye. One might have hoped that a field so regularly ploughed might have yielded one good crop.
in truth, I have seen healthier graveyards than that woman's womb.
come on!
I am asked continually on what side Your Grace will declare himself.
where Argyll goes, the path must be firm and broad.
and now all watch to see which way to jump.
one cannot go to the closet but what some adherent to James is praising your pish.
and I confess to a certain weariness in this whole issue, and look for the light of Your Grace to give some lead.
and all I could answer, in honesty, was that it would be the one most inclined to his own benefit.
damn it, man. But you talk too much. Can you not tend to your wager?
Argyll, my wager is well won.
damn it, Guthrie!
is it not enough that you're beaten, but you must turn backstabber?
my factor will call upon Your Grace's factor.
well done, Rob, man.
cut out another of the cattle.
if the tinkers ate one, they could have eaten two.
Montrose will charge you, nonetheless.
I'm weary of seeing children hungry and old folk cold.
it'll take more than a cow to fix that, Rob.
Aye. Well, you'll be in the Americas, living off the fat, so it won't worry you.
will you have some broth, Rob? - No, Coll. I'm for home.
God bless you, Rob.
and then Rob just walks in among them, his sword still in its sheath,
and says, "Up. Get up, you bunch of ragged-arsed..."
Hello, Rob.
Hello, Rob!
get up, you bunch of ragged-arsed tinker cow thieves!
and Rob up to him and says, "Tell your crew to lay down and I'll only cut your throat,"
else I'll call my men.
and we're all there. We are ready.
get up, boy. Come on.
go on. Get.
I dreamed a selkie came.
and what did he do to you, your selkie?
you wakened me before the best of it.
but he would have ravished me for certain.
how do you know you're awake, wife?
Mr. Killearn. I'm on my way.
Aye. Well on the way, I'd venture.
let me be, Mr. Killearn. You'll wake him. Don't, Mr. Killearn!
I'm sure the young master has you nicely greased, does he not?
Betty, you'd hardly feel me going in.
a wee whiff of quim in the morning, Mr. Cunningham, sir.
just the thing to clear your head.
Mr. Cunningham, I hope I'm not disturbing you.
of course you're bloody well disturbing me.
do you think I want to wake up and find some great smelly Scotchman staring down at me?
what are you doing here?
I wanted to tell you that some of the local trades people have been pressing for payment on your debt.
and you woke me to tell me that?
a thousand apologies, Mr. Cunningham, but they've also writ to His Lordship.
damn it, man.
I but recently earned His Lordship 200 guineas.
what are the complaints of a few tradesmen for such services?
this country does not agree with me.
I cannot wait to be out of the damnable place.
the sentiments of a great many of us, sir.
would you like me to take away your chamber pot?
I know many a Scotsman would be glad of this on a cold morning.
it's almost pure spirit, and I'm no judge of a pint of pish.
come back. Come here!
I killed Tam Sibbald yesterday morning.
we played ball once at Crieff market.
I remember shouting, "Well done, Tam," when he made a run.
and there he was, hung on the end of my dirk like meat.
Aye.
well, likely it was necessary.
aye, it was. Necessary enough to save worse.
but those tinkers weren't all born broken men, Mary.
some of them had kin and clan.
they made me fear I might have come across one of our own among them.
MacGregors are not tinkers.
but a hard winter or two away, some of us...
what's gnawing on you, Robert?
I've made up my mind to borrow money from Montrose to buy cattle at Crieff market and sell at Carlisle.
how much money?
1000.0
and I know cattle.
I can drive them faster and deliver them fatter than any man in the kingdom.
and why would the Marquis of Montrose lend a MacGregor 1, 000?
for profit, what else? It's an investment as much as a loan.
so it's business partners you are now, you and the Marquis.
keep that tongue for your boys, woman.
I didn't tell you my mind to be flayed for it.
you know I love the bones of you, Robert MacGregor.
but you take too much to heart that cannot be helped.
it must be helped.
all right, but not today.
I got yous. I got the two of yous!
got the two of yous!
father, will MacGregors ever be kings again?
all men with honor are kings, but not all kings have honor.
what is honor?
honor is what no man can give you, and none can take away.
honor is a man's gift to himself.
do women have it?
women are the heart of honor, and we cherish and protect it in them.
you must never mistreat a woman or malign a man, nor stand by and see another do so.
how do you know if you have it?
never worry on the getting of it.
it grows in you and speaks to you.
all you need do is listen.
all right, lads, enough of the finer things.
you've animals to tend to and water to haul.
away with you.
your mother and me will be down directly.
take the basket.
come on! I'll race you down the hill.
do you know how fine you are to me, Mary MacGregor?
so fine.
is that why you sent them away?
to tell me how fine I am?
or did you want to make a silk purse out of my sow's ear again?
what a wanton I'm wed to.
you know what the old wives say about these standing stones?
no.
what do the old wives say, old wife?
come here.
what do they say?
so, what do they say?
they say the stones make men hard, and women fertile.
we've no need of them, you and me.
you know how fine you are to me, Robert MacGregor?
extended this credit because you were my guest?
or as you prefer to frame it, "a member of my household"?
I can assure Your Lordship I have in no manner indebted him.
and now Killearn tells me that you are saddling one of my serving wenches.
damn it, sir! Your mother did not send you to me to debauch innocent girls.
I regret that I have so offended Your Lordship.
by your leave, I will remove myself.
and to where, might I ask?
you are penniless. You have no mount.
you know no one.
to where will you remove yourself?
have you some notion of presenting yourself at the Duke of Argyll's door, and soliciting his patronage as his new champion?
I am Your Lordship's to command.
remember your place, sir!
that's all I ask of any man.
what is next?
MacGregor, my lord.
you may go, Archibald.
you bear no arms?
I hadn't planned on demanding terms at sword point.
robert MacGregor of Craigrostan, my lord.
so, MacGregor,
I knew your father, an able man, if not a wise one.
have you taken on his mantle?
as best I may, my lord.
so, how many men are you master of?
master of none, my lord, but some 200 souls live close by Craigrostan, and are in my care.
but you are a prophet and provider to them, is that not so?
what I can, I do.
it is no great matter compared to Your Lordship's world.
to know one's place, MacGregor, in the order of things is a great blessing.
and what terms, Killearn? - A fifth, my lord.
a fifth, you say?
what, is this man kin that you offer such kindly terms?
am I not accustomed to a quarter on unsecured loans?
MacGregor has 300 acres at Craigrostan, my lord.
a man of property intent on growing richer.
well, we have more in common than I would have suspected, MacGregor.
1, 000 for three months, you say, and these acres of yours as security?
and my oath.
Yes.
tell me, is there something in what Killearn says, that you might have driven off my cattle, and returned them with stories of tinkers caught and summarily executed?
I have, in my day, thieved cattle, Your Lordship, but none that were under my watch.
is that what passes for honor with a MacGregor, then?
what passes for honor with me is likely enough the same as with Your Lordship.
when my word is given, it is good.
well, you are to be congratulated on such cheaply bought nobility.
Killearn will draw papers.
and I will expect the terms to be met.
my thanks to Your Lordship.
aye, but it's a fine, bold signature you have, worthy of a chieftain himself.
are you Rob Roy MacGregor?
I am. And what's your name? - Davey Anderson.
Hello, Davey Anderson. - Hello.
even the servant boys know who you are.
you've become a famous reiver and retriever in your own lifetime.
business and profit.
and a soft winter.
are you Rob Roy MacGregor?
I am.
I'm Will Guthrie.
you heard of me?
no, I have not.
well, I've heard of you.
indeed.
and what have you heard, Mr. Guthrie?
I heard you backstabbed Tam Sibbald.
were you and Tam kin?
near enough.
I shagged his sister.
likely so did Tam.
you want the wind let out of your bladder?
what's your business with me, Guthrie?
business best done outside.
we have no quarrel.
that can be remedied.
the first cut?
Aye.
well done.
some other time, when we're both sober.
tam Sibbald has a longer reach dead than he ever did living.
I'm away home.
keep the pony and stick to Killearn till you have the note.
I'll see you back in Craigrostan. - Aye.
I'm to wait here till the note is signed.
Aye. We are the obedient one.
fetch and carry at command.
tell me, McDonald, why has a smart young lad like you attached himself to such a bunch of tinkers?
I would have thought you more fit to serve a man like my master, the Marquis of Montrose.
I do not serve Robert MacGregor, Killearn.
I'm his friend, and count myself fortunate to claim it.
my God, what a crew you Highlanders are.
sheep shaggers, the lot of you.
my mother could come no nearer than three candidates for my paternity.
the Earl of Rutland.
now, there's a name for a whore master.
a secretary to the Spanish Ambassador, whose name she hazarded as Ferdinando.
and some young buck she never saw who raised her skirts at a masked ball.
he ravished her?
I would put it no higher than surprised.
Archie, take me with you.
wherever, whatever.
take me away with you.
I am away, Betty, and God help me, this is where I've landed.
you think me a gentleman because I have linen and can manage a lisp.
I am but a bastard abroad, seeking my fortune and the favors of great men, as big a whore as my mother ever was.
I'm pregnant by you, Archie.
well.
when it asks for its father's name, at least you'll have it to give.
Mr. Cunningham, it's me, Killearn.
a word with you. - Don't let him see me.
you are a carbuncle on this arse of a country, Killearn.
and if you ever inform against me to His Lordship again,
I'll squeeze the pus out of you with my bare hands.
my, Archie, but you have a rare contempt in you.
I gave you no leave to call me familiar.
could I pay for the privilege?
at a fair price.
what are you gibbering about?
money, Archie. Money. What else?
how much money?
let's talk inside over a dram.
it's chill on the stairs.
say what you have to say. I am engaged within.
you've Betty on her back.
how much money?
1000
1, 000. What does 1, 000 look like?
will we have enough ponies to carry it?
not coin.
a note of credit drawn on His Lordship.
at what interest, Rob? - One fifth.
and he gets 200 profit for three months?
Aye. That's the price of cash, and we must plan the matter to the last penny.
when Alan returns, he'll take three of you, and you'll go to Crieff.
there you'll bargain with the drovers, and have the herd assembled when I come with a kit for the drive.
how many, Rob? How big a herd?
300, maybe more.
and whatever we can acquire along the way.
no harm if a dozen or more stick.
we'll drive them into Carlisle like an army.
so let's have all hands to it.
and we'll stay warm this winter, within and without.
and to celebrate, we'll hold a gathering and drink to our success!
right, McKinness. That's two shillings still owed.
next. - Colqhoun.
Colqhoun, what have you got? A rabbit?
aye, a rabbit.
well, you're still a week behind, Colqhoun.
must I wait all day for my note, Killearn?
patience, MacGregor's man. Your turn is marked.
take you that goat to the pen.
come, young Davey Wilson. What have you got for me?
a rabbit. - Another rabbit.
does nobody have any money? - No, sir. Only a rabbit.
dreaming of the New World, were we?
I hear tell in the New World they have tribes of noble savages with paint on their faces and skins on their backs.
you'll be well at home among them.
enough of this tripe. Have you the note?
his Lordship is to Edinburgh for the assize, then to London direct.
great doings at the court.
and he's away without signing the note.
the best I can do for you is coin.
this was not agreed.
agreed or no, there's 1, 000 here. Take it or leave it, it makes no difference to me, nor to His Grace.
aye, it's a terrible shock, the sight of such a fortune within reach, is it not?
it's just as well you have the trust of the MacGregor, or I'd be hard pressed to sign it over to you.
Angus. - It's a great gathering, Rob!
that Alasdair Roy is a fierce dancer.
the last time I saw you in such a lather, you were flat on your back.
do not affront me afore these folk.
rob, do you know why Calvinists are against shagging standing up?
no, Coll. I do not.
they fear it might lead to dancing.
stay back, or by God, I'll shoot you dead.
for a moment there,
killing is not so easy as it seems.
he sat out there all day, pondering on this.
you gave him coin.
he insisted upon it.
when I told him His Grace had not signed the note, he said you must have it, or the beasts could not be bought at the best price.
I'm hard put to see you hand over such a sum on the demand of one who couldn't bear the debt.
he was your man, present at your signing of the terms, ordered by you to wait.
for a note, not a bag of guineas!
it was not all guineas.
these farmers pay in small coin, I assure you.
he signed for this bag of coin?
indeed.
he did.
almost as bold a hand as yourself.
and best be no skullduggery here, Killearn.
alan McDonald stands under my protection.
well, that's a great comfort to us all, I must say, what with 1, 000 at risk.
now, listen. We must search for Alan.
I fear he's come to mischief hereabouts.
I say we look for him in Greenock, Rob.
it comes quickly to your mind that he has robbed us, Alasdair.
he spoke of the America often enough.
and what?
he walked to Greenock from Buchlyvie, and sent his pony home without him?
1, 000 would be enough to buy him 10 ponies.
alan McDonald did not betray me.
now to it, and find his trace.
come on! To it!
go to Greenock, then, since you have that stink in your nose.
but, Brother, bad enough that it might be so without you wishing it.
well, what news?
the ship sailed the day before I got there, and McDonald's name was not on the harbormaster's list.
but he wouldn't have likely used his own name and him run off with 1, 000...
your Lordship, the Duke of Argyll this way comes.
John, you look like a man who means to play hard.
do not presume to speak above your station, sir!
I will have my rank from you!
your Grace.
I have word from court that you are putting my name about as a Jacobite, as one who would rise for the Stuart should he land here to claim the throne.
great men such as yourself draw rumors as shite draws flies.
you are the shite, Montrose, and the flies upon it!
for all the flowers in your great gardens, I know you in my nose.
keep your stink off my name, or by God, I will clip you as close as one of your gelded trees, and this carrion you keep will not come between us!
what pride to use a fellow peer in public so!
damn his pride!
forgive me.
damn His Grace's pride.
why is it so beyond your belief that he might have yielded to the sight of all that money put into his hand?
unguarded, unasked, but there, a lifetime's wages in a bag.
because I know him. I know him more than half his life.
but was he ever handed 1, 000 before?
he was handed a hundred times more. He was given trust, and he repaid in kind.
why do you not believe me?
all right, Rob. He did not steal from you.
but he has gone, and the money's gone, and Montrose will not care if you believe one thing or the other.
that's another matter. - No. That is the only matter now.
for all our sakes, Robert, you must take off your high hat and make what terms you can, else our home is lost, and ourselves His Lordship's tenants.
here comes the bold Highlander.
no arse in his breeks, but too proud to tug his forelock.
no doubt the rogue seeks to blame his servant, for I hear there is no word of the man.
I see you're back in favor with your tailor, Archibald.
he must be a happy man.
so, MacGregor, how is it with you?
as it was, my lord.
there is still no word of McDonald or Your Lordship's money.
what are we to do, then?
if Your Lordship would contract with me for another sum,
I would turn over all profit and so repay my debt.
I have but lost 1, 000. You ask me to risk another?
my lord, the money was stolen from me and from you.
I am no part of your incompetence, MacGregor.
you signed a paper. - And I will honor it.
ply me not with your honor, man.
let us keep these matters simple.
you are indebted to me. On that we are agreed?
we are, my lord.
know you the Duke of Argyll?
by his repute alone.
my report is that Argyll is a Jacobite, and would declare for James Stuart should he seek to reclaim the throne.
these are intelligences unknown to me, my lord.
they are known to you now.
I'm uncertain of Your Lordship's meaning.
damn it, man!
you and your clan are Jacobites, bred to the bone.
Argyll is nothing to you.
I want your word against him.
give it, and we will come to some reckoning on what you owe me.
I can be of no assistance to Your Lordship in this matter of the Duke of Argyll.
you owe me.
I owe you money. Nothing more.
what you have asked is as below me as it should be beneath Your Lordship.
you misspeak yourself, MacGregor.
it is the Marquis of Montrose who has misspoke himself, to ask my perjury against his enemies.
leave the blade be, sir! This is not your quarrel.
you do not hear me, MacGregor. I did not ask if or whether.
your land is forfeit to me against your debt.
until that is settled, I will have you lodged in the tollbooth.
take him into custody, Archibald. You have my commission on it!
my father spent two years in that jail for no cause but the will of great men like you.
and I will not go there, sir.
call out the watch, damn you!
call nothing, or I'll cut his throat!
you are damned, MacGregor. Damned to hell.
come, Your Lordship. Leave the devil some work.
you've done enough for one day.
well, call out the watch!
Yes, sir.
call out the watch!
do you hear me? Call out the watch!
you have slept your last peaceful night, MacGregor, you and yours.
what is John Campbell, Duke of Argyll, to us, Robert, that you must defend him against Montrose?
I did not defend him.
I refused to bear false witness against him.
gregor, send men to the passes and set watches.
and the lochside?
they'll not likely come along by the shore, but watch all ways.
now, listen, lads. I have to go to the hills for a time.
you stay by your mother and be her help, you hear?
let Argyll know that you are persecuted for his sake.
I'm persecuted for no man's sake but my own, Mary.
what?
would you have me lie against my conscience to suit Montrose?
No! To suit me and Duncan and Ranald, to stay home with your wife and children instead of taking to the hills like a fox.
out!
out! Out! Out!
he'll be with you soon enough!
take the boys and go to Morag's. She'll make a place.
and let Montrose's troopers foul my house?
no harm will come to you. Montrose's quarrel is with me.
and you revel in it. The great man against all.
and likely you'll slip down in the night when the mood takes you.
or will you just find yourself a sheep to comfort you?
aye, well, if I do, it will be one that doesn't bleat so bitter.
no trouble between them and you. Give no cause.
this is between me and Montrose, and likely when he's broke a few horses, he'll quieten down.
watch Alasdair. Put him where he can do no harm.
keep up the watch for McDonald.
rob, he's long gone.
aye, but is he over the seas or under them?
and, Coll, ask Morag to go down to Mary. She's sore at me for this business.
that Montrose is a stoat of a man. Heaven protect us from his like.
when the king comes across the water again, we'll see him hung.
your Lordship will not regret leaving this matter in my hands.
I have some knowledge of how best to bring such rogues to heel.
broken but not dead, Archibald. That is all I ask.
broken but not dead.
it has a ring to it.
your health.
goodbye!
instead of spying them out, we should lay for them, and cut them down as they come through the passes.
aye, a wee war with Montrose would suit us fine.
listen, Alasdair Roy.
keep your watch, give warning, and stay your hand, or you'll answer to me.
damn that McDonald has brought this on us.
I never trusted the man. Always at Rob's arse like a collie dog.
Morag had a dream on him. Saw him drowned.
maybe his ship sank, and him loaded down with the theft.
give me your musket.
boys, wake up! Wake up! Quickly! Quickly!
get out of bed!
go, go! Bring the Gregorach!
I've come for the outlaw Robert MacGregor.
if you think he'd be lying in his bed waiting for you, you're more of a fool than you look.
search the outsheds. Burn them.
kill the stock.
you best stand aside, Mistress MacGregor.
you don't ask a whore. You make her.
No!
do you want yours now, Killearn?
now that I've loosened her up for you.
think of yourself as the scabbard and me the sword, Mistress MacGregor.
and a fine fit you were, too.
I will think of you dead until my husband makes you so.
and then I will think on you no more.
indeed.
such a man as he will need to see blood on his blade before honor is satisfied.
tell him Archibald Cunningham is at his service.
what are you gawking at? Have you never been to war before?
you're a warrior, Archie, and no mistake.
if she doesn't come out, Archie, there will be a reckoning.
shagging her's one thing, burning her's another.
she'll be out. She's a hater, that one. There she is.
back to the boat!
they say it's not a sin if you don't take pleasure in it.
come on!
come on! Come on!
I am Alasdair Roy MacGregor!
come on! Come on!
is that the best you can do?
do it again, bastards!
come on!
come on! Come on! Come...
Mary, are you hurt? Did they wound you?
Mary.
what have they done?
we will avenge you.
rob will kill every last one of them.
he will not know. Rob will not know.
Mary, Rob must know.
he will not! He will not know!
he will not!
I will not tell him, and you will not.
do you hear me, Alasdair MacGregor?
but, Mary, no. - It is what they want!
it is what the Englishman wants! It is his plan!
you swear it to me. Swear it!
I cannot! I cannot! - Swear it! Swear it!
you can!
if I can bear it to be done, you can bear to be silent!
now, you swear it! Swear it.
swear it. Swear it.
swear it! Swear it! - I swear. I swear. I swear.
and I will hold you to it.
mark me.
but of MacGregor himself, still no word?
we will have him soon enough.
I have set such an affront to his Highland honor, that he will come to redeem it.
very well.
still no word of this man of MacGregor's?
he who took the coin?
no, my lord, not a word.
nor will there be.
this was a ploy of MacGregor's, to take the money and blame another.
his man is well hid, and Your Lordship's money well spent.
I wager it.
you have a rare grasp of the conspirator's mind, Archibald.
you're to be commended on it.
he sees through it, Archie. I know him and his gibes.
and you think it would count against us if he knew?
he has another 300 acres to plant and prune.
and all for the price of a paltry 1, 000 Scotch pounds.
a fair price by any reckoning. - Archie, sir!
I must speak with you.
I am dismissed from service on account of my state.
and what is your state, pretty Betty?
you know well. I'm with your child.
and he, this one, has made report of it.
Betty, my report did nothing your belly wouldn't announce on its own.
Archie, what am I to do?
root it out.
if Killearn here does not know an old crone with a twig I miss my guess.
it's gone too far for that.
then it will not be the first bastard born in Scotland.
Archie, I love you.
love is a dunghill, Betty, and I am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow.
No!
it's a sore thing they have done to us, Mary and me.
far past any wrong I had expected, even from such as Montrose.
he must pay for it, Rob!
else what are we?
pay he will till his teeth squeal.
think on it, now. Think on it.
even if we raised all the MacGregors, we could not, must not, fight Montrose in open battle.
he has 10, 20 times our numbers and the strength of the Crown to back him.
there is honor here.
you were wronged. Mary is wronged.
honor will be satisfied. You know me well enough.
but consider this.
one house burned, cattle killed, but none are dead, none injured.
rob is right.
rob is right!
it is not within our reach to harm such as Montrose.
Wheesht! Wheesht! Wheesht!
Wheesht! Wheesht!
I will harm him. Never fear.
Aye! Aye!
the tenderest part of the Marquis is his purse.
we'll hurt him there.
thieve his cattle. Steal his rent.
rent and cattle, until his coffers are bled.
Aye! Aye!
wait! Wait!
Wheesht! Wheesht! Morag.
we have not heard Mary on it, and in truth, she was the one most affronted.
rob is right. What cannot be helped must be endured.
it will look more like itself when the sun shines.
eh, lads? Yeah.
when we have our bed in it and us in our bed, it will seem home enough.
all right, play can wait. We have work to do.
Duncan.
I should have been with you, Mary.
it wasn't right that I was in the hills.
then you would be dead now.
no. They would have taken me to the tollbooth.
no. I think you would be dead.
I could not hear all of it, but Killearn talked of money that Archie might take.
this is Cunningham, this Archie?
he is wild, but it's not him.
it's that Killearn. He has the devil in him.
tell me about this money. Did you hear a sum spoken?
Archie said it would be the easiest 1, 000 he'd ever earned.
the only pity that it would be in Scots and not English pounds.
how did he mean to earn this 1, 000?
I know not.
save that Killearn said no trace must be left.
my husband will appreciate that you came with this word.
will you take some supper and rest, Betty? For you look ill-used.
I'm no worse used than I deserve, Mistress MacGregor.
for I have a bastard's bastard in me.
and no home for him when he comes out.
well, we better feed you, or he won't have the strength to try it.
lass, lass, lass.
bear up now.
your bairn will have you, and you will have it.
but I will not have Archie.
mistress MacGregor, I love him, even after all.
is that not a worse sin than any other?
no, Betty.
love is never a sin, only the lack of it.
I knew it. I knew they plotted against us.
damn them that they carried it through.
I will have them before the assize.
Killearn and Cunningham. Aye, and Montrose, too, if he were part of it.
you think such men as these will admit this, because wee Betty Sturrock, with her belly under her chin, says so?
what's her belly to do with it?
she's carrying the Englishman's child.
they'll call her a whore come for revenge.
now, they can say what they like. She'll speak the truth.
Robert, to these men, the truth is but a lie undiscovered.
I will have justice!
alan McDonald is dead, woman.
then take your case to the Duke of Argyll.
it's known he bears Montrose no favor.
you hold great store by wolves of different shades.
they're all alike at lambing.
and you will have nothing but your own way!
I tell you, Killearn and Cunningham will not be condemned before any assize on Betty's word.
Aye. But I know one that will condemn them.
and I'll have them before it, or I'm not Robert MacGregor.
the Englishman will never find him.
MacGregor knows every rock and track, and can walk faster than the troopers can ride.
look, put me onto His Lordship as a man that knows the highways and byways.
I'll find him. I swear it.
on your feet, Killearn. You and I have business.
now is your moment, Guthrie. It would stand well with His Lordship.
this is not your fight, Guthrie.
and if I make it my fight?
then give Tam Sibbald my regards when you see him.
fight him well and you'll win His Lordship's favor.
I warrant it.
please, please, please don't kill me. Don't kill me. It wasn't me.
outside.
it's him the lass wants revenge on. Cunningham.
and I grant it, he treated her sore.
if you harm me, His Lordship will hunt you down, and you know it.
I'm past caring, Killearn.
the lantern.
go back, get Betty, and we'll try him before morning. Now.
inside.
Mary! Mary!
who is it? - It's Alasdair.
Rob's holding Killearn, and he wants to see Betty straightaway.
I'll wake her.
treat her gentle. She's near the end of her tether.
Where's my father?
Wheesht.
are the soldiers coming?
you two should be sleeping.
No!
stay there!
get my knife!
Mary? Where's the girl?
Betty Sturrock hanged herself in our shed.
she made me bring her. - I told... I made him bring me for I have dealings with this Killearn.
me and Betty Sturrock and Betty Sturrock's child, the three of us will bring it out of him.
no. This is no matter for him.
this is between us.
as I am your wife, Robert, I will have my way in this, I will.
Betty! Is that you?
Betty is dead.
she killed herself this night, and her unborn with her.
mistress MacGregor.
so the poor girl is dead.
spare me your hypocrisy, Killearn.
you are as much her murderer as she, you and that Englishman.
I had no part in her child any more than that matter at Craigrostan.
you stood and gloated. You did all with your eyes.
you have not told him.
you think me such a puppet that I would put my husband's head in a noose fashioned from my own dishonor?
you have a proposal for me. I can tell.
you will sign your name to a statement telling how you slew Alan McDonald, stole my husband's money, burned our property.
before a judge you will sign it.
and let them hang me in the tollbooth for my trouble?
no great inducement, Mistress MacGregor.
when it is signed, you may go where you will.
where you can.
I shall not soon forget, Mary, the last time I saw you.
how nobly you walked from that burning, like a queen.
you will sign it or else. - Or else what?
you'll tell Rob how Cunningham used you?
I have another picture, not so noble, of you stood in Lomond water, washing between your legs.
I've wondered many a time since that morning, did you wash Archie out of you, or is he still in there, growing into his father?
Yes.
well, I have a proposal for you, Mistress MacGregor.
persuade your man that Cunningham alone killed his man and kept the money entirely, and I will not speak of what you have inside you.
rob would be hard pressed to love such a bastard, would he not?
but you know the saying, Mary.
tis a wise father knows his own child.
and if you'll not say anything, neither will I.
you have my word on it.
cut me...
she cut me. The bitch cut me!
Mary, are you hurt? Are you hurt?
what have you done, woman?
am I cut bad? Am I cut bad?
not bad enough for me.
I mean, my God, what made you do such a thing?
I have as much cause as you in this. More.
he has to be made to confess.
he will never confess.
Betty was right. He has the devil in him.
devil or no, he's my prisoner. Don't you understand?
Robert, there are things you must know.
things I have to tell you.
so? Tell me.
there was...
well?
he's dead, Rob. I could do nothing.
Robert, listen to me now.
there's no time for talk now.
Alasdair, can you sink a man?
Aye. - Cut the wind out of him, put a rock in his belly, take him out where it's deep.
Montrose will scour us out now for sure.
we must make sure you and the lads are safe before he comes.
deep, mind you!
I am mocked by this rogue who you took to deliver me broken.
tis myself who will be broken if these raids go on.
now my factor is abducted in plain view.
am I gone mad?
your Lordship... - Do not...
do not, I say, speak in my stead.
there's something here that I do not see.
Killearn and you have some hand in matters that is hid from sight.
this tells me that you are in cash, yet I know you are without means.
gaming, Your Lordship. The cards favored.
do you take me entirely for a Whig, sir?
I care not what you and that greasy capon have cooked up, but put an end to this impudence against me.
I am James Graham, Marquis of Montrose.
and I will not be mocked.
you hear me?
we can't let them burn, loot, and ride away.
we should hit them, Rob. Cunningham is there.
he's the one that took... - I know who he is.
have you no thought to avenge Mary for that?
there's 30 or more men. They'd ride us down like sheep.
Alasdair MacGregor is no sheep.
Coll's right. We can do nothing.
company, make ready!
attention, men!
damn the wee fool! Scatter! Into the mist. Find your own way home!
there they are!
after him!
I want MacGregor!
fire, you fools! Fire!
I hit one of them.
and it will cost us, I'm thinking.
move! Move!
God's curse on you for a brother, Alasdair.
I want MacGregor!
you're getting too old for the wars, Rob, eh?
come on!
fire! Fire, you fools! Fire!
put me down. I can run. - Shut your mouth.
run, Rob, run!
go on, Rob! Run for yourself!
I want MacGregor! I want MacGregor! After him!
be quiet!
hold still. Hold still.
knocked the breath out of me.
rob, I can't feel my legs.
are they there?
aye, aye. Your legs are fine.
forgive me, Rob, for I can't forgive myself.
save your breath, lad.
I couldn't have saved her, Rob.
they were done with Mary before I reached them.
she made me swear not to tell you.
I'm sorry.
done what with Mary? Done what?
she said...
she said if she could bear it...
what of Mary, Alasdair? - Rob, I can't see.
I'm here, Alasdair. What of Mary? What of it?
they...
they violated her.
Alasdair, who did this?
the mist is clearing. Be ready.
be ready to search upwards!
you men, search upwards!
there was a shot on the ledge.
forward!
where is he? - Over there!
get the horse!
well, well. The great MacGregor come to hand at last.
well, how does it seem to you tonight, MacGregor?
is God's great plan for us all to your liking?
"broken but not dead" was His Lordship's request.
well, I will do my part if you will do yours and not die before the bridge at Glen Orchy.
tell me, what did you do with that bag of guts, Killearn?
vex me not, MacGregor. Or I shall have you dragged awhile.
I'm a man of my word.
you're a thief, a murderer, and a violator of women.
I had hoped you'd come to me long since on that score.
if I had known earlier, you would have been dead sooner.
I will tell you something to take with you.
your wife was far sweeter forced than many are willing.
in truth, put to it, I think not all of her objected.
I appreciate the honor you do me, Mistress MacGregor, in bringing your case.
but from all I'm acquainted with your husband, he has earned the enmity of the Marquis of Montrose by borrowing money that he cannot repay, and ever harrying his stock as blackmail.
there is more to the matter, Your Grace.
I'm sure there is, but it is not part of mine to intrude myself.
sensible as I am to your condition.
it's a hard thought, but men make the quarrels and women and weans bear them.
your Grace, Robert finds himself in this condition for taking your part.
my part?
what cause had he to do that and in what manner?
he refused to condemn you by false witness when the Marquis asked him to say you were a Jacobite, to injure your name at court.
Montrose asked this of him?
in remission of this debt.
but Robert refused.
I did not know your husband bore me such good will.
indeed, Your Grace, I think he favors you no more than any great man.
as wolves at lambing is his word for you all.
it was not done for Your Grace but for his own honor, which he holds dearer than myself or his sons, his clan or kin. And for which I have oft chided him.
but it is him and his way, and were he other, he would not be Robert Roy MacGregor.
he would not come here before you nor would he favor me to do so in his stead.
but I have no choice, unless I give him up entire to his enemies.
and though I love his honor, it is but a moon-cast shadow to the love I bear him.
for the grace of God, I have his child inside me.
and I would have a father for it.
you do your man no dishonor, Mary.
faith, he is a man much blessed by fortune.
they have MacGregor, my lord.
cavalry, halt!
broken but not dead, Your Lordship, as you requested.
ungag him.
so, MacGregor, what have you to say for yourself?
I have been wronged by Your Lordship and by those who serve him.
you are wronged?
you?
if I am not much mistaken, it is myself that is short 1, 000, whose cattle is reived, and whose factor, Killearn, is abducted.
then ask this thing here where your money is and where he sunk Alan McDonald after he killed him.
same accusations he spat at me, Your Lordship.
desperate words from a desperate man.
do you have proofs of these matters?
you have my word on it.
I think it will take more than that.
then you have the nature of this man here.
if Your Lordship cannot tell what is true from what is not, then I fear his judgment is beyond repair.
hang him from the bridge.
MacGregor! - Cut him free!
bring him back here!
I want him back!
bring him back here!
in the water!
I see him! I see him!
right through that gap!
just through there!
get off your mounts and walk.
what a stench! - Get after him!
what a stink! - Wait till you smell this.
let's get downwind of this.
is this where we may stay?
aye, by His Grace's goodness, under his protection.
will Father come here? - If he can.
Coll!
No!
Robert?
Robert!
my Robert!
what have they done with you?
you should have told me, Mary.
Robert, I should have, but I could not.
forgive me, my love. I was wrong.
it was wrong.
no. It was me who was wrong.
you were right when you told me I must have it my own way.
it's that which brought all this on us.
I should have packed my pride and given Montrose his way.
no, Robert. - And all this has come on us, - all this you have endured. - No.
Craigrostan would still be ours. Alasdair and Coll would be alive.
and wrong would have been done you!
and what of the wrong done you, wrong past bearing?
no, not past bearing. Not past bearing.
not if I have my Robert and he has himself.
honor is the gift a man gives himself. You told our boys that.
would you have stolen from yourself that what makes you Robert MacGregor?
my Mary.
how fine you are to me.
and you to me.
Robert, there is more.
what more?
I am carrying a child and I do not know who is the father.
Ach, Mary.
Mary.
I could not kill it, husband.
it is not the child who needs killing.
this point of honor might likely kill you, sir.
I have seen the man at work and he is no dunce with a blade.
if Your Grace could arrange this I would be more beholding to him than I already am.
very well. I will see what I can make of it.
MacGregor.
sir?
he will kill you, MacGregor.
I would lose money if I wagered other.
your Lordship has my permission to profit what way he may.
I have had a correspondence from His Grace, the Duke of Argyll.
it would seem that our MacGregor is holed with him.
he offers us a match. You and the Highlander.
Argyll would recoup his loss from his last wager.
bring him on.
you speak, Archibald?
one must never underestimate the healing power of hatred.
how long must you go, Father?
just for a while.
is it business you have with the Duke?
aye, business.
so, boys, have you heard there's going to be another addition to the family?
show them where it's hid, Mary.
is it inside you?
how does it get out?
the same road it got in.
Robert...
Robert, what if you don't... - Wheesht.
no, I cannot.
what if...
I cannot.
what if you do not return to us?
if it's a boy, call him Robert.
if a lass, name her for my love, Mary MacGregor.
my man Guthrie was like an ox at the knacker's yard under Cunningham's blade.
you will need to be twice as quick as poor Will.
tell me, MacGregor, is this matter of honor concerning your wife?
it's concerning me, Your Grace.
Mr. Cunningham and I have matters outstanding.
she will not thank you for making her a widow, honor or no.
perhaps you'd like to wager a sum for her maintenance.
if it will help you die any easier, I'll lay 20 guineas for her.
50 would go further.
my God, but you have a style to you, MacGregor.
I like that. Aye.
so, what are we to wager on this outcome, Your Grace?
guineas again?
I want no part of this. There are more than champions here.
I think these men hate the other.
Aye.
they are none too fond.
you offered MacGregor amnesty from his debts if he would lay charges against me.
so, that is how he cozened you to give him shelter.
I know the truth when I hear it.
and here was me thinking that that was God's gift alone.
do not think that all sins go unpunished in this life, Montrose.
well...
I see one set soon to be paid for.
will you not take my odds, Argyll?
I give you five on the fop.
I wager you but this, if MacGregor lives, you will acquit him of all he owes you.
and if he loses?
I will pay his bill.
my factor will call upon Your Grace's factor.
you are here on a matter of honor.
I am here to assure you settle it honorably.
there will be no backstabbing.
you will not throw your blades, nor will you use weapons other than agreed.
if quarter is asked...
no quarter will be asked.
or given.
attend upon your weapons, and commence upon my mark.
neither asked nor given.
I will hold you to our bargain.
those wounds will need care.
by Your Grace's leave, I'll go where it can best be found.
as you will.
I will know who to wager on the next time.
I hope Your Grace will live so long.
mother! Look!
bring it over here.
help me get this into a pile.
how? Joderic will be under orders.
how is not for you to worry about.
I cannot be seen to take from you.
I cannot even be seen with you. Our Matthew...
our Matthew has work at the castle.
Owen.
take your wife and family and get your belongings back into the mill.
Joderic will not evict you today.
let's go.
Robin says you're gonna be all right.
what are you waiting for?
nothing.
I explained thing to him. Everything's gonna be all right.
Oh, please! - What?
you want to see the look on her face, don't you? You want to see the gratitude.
Joderic!
Robin...
do not interfere. You know I have to do this.
and you know there are Sheriff's men on their way to make sure there 's no trouble.
do you have to do this?
I did it under the old Sheriff, you did not complain.
that was different. -How?
two things are certain in life. - Death and taxes.
but when the death is caused by the taxes, something is rotten.
take this.
the miller's debt. - I cannot.
this is stolen money.
the Sheriff knows the miller cannot afford it.
I could break it into small amounts. Pay it in over time.
that would be credible.
every time somebody breaks bread in Nettlestone, they will thank you, Joderic.
sure. - Do me a favor.
tell them you have not seen me.
tell them this was your own scheme.
Why? - My friends think I am vain!
he's here to evict us. Robin did not make it right.
he said he would fix it. - How?
let me get this straight.
we're giving money to a tax collector?
a bailiff.
Oh, that makes all the difference.
Owen.
Kate.
as you know, I am here today...
didn't you see Robin Hood? He said he'd speak to you so we wouldn't be evicted.
no. No, I'm sorry...
I have not seen Robin Hood.
but we can work this out.
he's killed him. Robin's killed him!
Oi, stop!
master!
what, you can't believe someone's better than you?
he kicked you good. - Who is he?
the Nightwatchman.
well, I've never heard of him. -The Nightwatchman? Been around for years.
maybe you were off on a crusade.
he's a good man.
he's talked about in all the villages.
he's been seen in Nottingham. Even at the castle. Always at night.
leaves medicine and stuff. Food.
sheriff's men are ordered to shoot him on sight but he's never hurt a fly.
why did he kill Joderic, then?
we need to find him.
the villagers of Nettlestone report that Robin Hood killed an innocent bailiff today.
this is marvelous, isn't it?
what drama!
because now even his beloved villagers will lose patience when their heroes start picking them off.
what else are they saying?
hood was fulfilling a promise to prevent an eviction.
war has addled his brain.
I'm not at all surprised.
so, what do you propose we do?
immediate reprisals against villages.
Joderic would not want that.
why should more innocent people suffer because of his death?
the same people who witnessed and reported the crime.
and did this strategy of reprisals work in the villages before?
no.
Marian is right.
we will not be going down that road again. De Fourtnoy - alternatives?
there is a... political advantage to be had here.
Robin Hood has given us the high ground. We should keep it, my thoughts exactly.
we could have the town criers announce what's taken place.
make sure everybody knows that an innocent was killed.
good.
we are going to win hearts and minds.
my lord.
I still believe actions rather than words...
if I had the resources I could deal with him, I could hunt him down...
very well.
we'll do both and may the best man win.
Joderic was unique.
he was kind, compassionate, learned.
the murder of the bailiff...
we'll leave as soon as Joderic's buried.
we can say you were too upset.
I am too upset.
in response to this change of direction from Robin Hood...
Joe? What are you doing here?
you cannot work.
they've made everyone come back in.
called me out of retirement.
I will talk to the Sheriff.
I'll get you off your duties.
work helps.
a war on terror! These people...
I still reach out for her in the night, I know it's daft...
it is not daft.
when all this is over you are coming home with us.
of our humanity and of our innocence.
all this is gone in one moment, with one arrow fired from the bow of Robin Hood.
he is saying you killed Joderic! - Of course he is.
Yes, but he's making us look like criminals!
you know we are criminals. -What?
are we suddenly something else?
...Between stability, order, authority or the random, chaotic cruelty of Robin Hood and all outlaws like him.
this cowardly crime, this murder, will be punished.
we will hunt Hood down, with dogs if necessary, and we will ensure that he does not succeed,
we will not be cowed, this is what he wants...
you never shoot me, understand?
this, this is all in my honor, isn't it?
you really do think everything is about you, don't you?
only when it is about me! - You have given him a stick to beat you with.
you killed an innocent clerk and now here he is making the most of it.
I did not do it.
I'm sure.
it was the so-called non-violent Nightwatchman.
No! - I saw him. I was there.
it was not the Nightwatchman.
how do you know? - I know.
then why did he run? - Why did you run from Joderic?
I should go.
you must help me. - I am helping you.
it was not the Nightwatchman.
whoever it is.
I will find him and I can look everywhere apart from one place.
I need you to look in the castle. - I need you to not tell me what to do.
please! I must clear my name.
what about catching the killer? Isn't that more important than your name?
if people do not trust me, then what good can I do?
I'll try.
tell me, De Fourtnoy. Is Master at Arms just a ceremonial position now?
because problems like Hood demand real solutions.
town criers?
sir Guy.
Marian.
all these dogs for one man?
Yeah, it was my idea.
the Master at Arms would have us doing nothing.
you are in competition?
he's a little man, promoted too far. Anyone would make a better Master at Arms.
politics. Even when my father was the Sheriff,
I could not grasp the intricacies.
he sent me here, by the way.
he thinks it is safer, with a killer on the loose.
you say "a killer" ? you do not think it is Hood?
whoever it is, he thought it would be safer here in the castle.
no, that's not permitted.
Oh.
I'll talk to the Sheriff.
thank you, Sir Guy.
right. I want a line sweeping south through the forest.
let's show De Fourtnoy how to hunt down Robin Hood.
with these dogs, he will run.
this I do not like.
the King's Guild of Hunters and Foresters. Coming this way.
dogs!
pairs. Meet where we stored the provisions.
faster!
Matthew, am I left-handed?
a clue...
No!
sorry, sir.
stand on one leg.
the right one.
one hour.
that might help you to remember, hm?
so...
new boy, how're you finding your new job? Hm?
Oh, don't worry. You know, you're a lucky boy.
now your daddy's mill is shut, you could be running through the forest chased by hounds...
guards! Guards!
raise the alarm!
in my own room? In my own room? Where are the men?
Gisborne has taken them to hunt Hood with the dogs.
Gisborne is a fool.
evidently, Hood has evaded him.
this is nothing to do with Robin Hood.
now, you lock down this castle. Tell Gisborne to scrap the dogs and find the killer!
Yes, my lord.
stop!
now, you tell Gisborne to double the dogs.
my lord, I thought you said it could not be Hood.
two words, -mud sticks.
hood's been blamed for one death, let's blame him for two.
meanwhile, you find out who's really responsible for this.
Yes, my lord.
we pray for Matthew's soul as he journeys to a better place.
watch over us, Matthew, and be proud.
we will bring Robin Hood to justice.
you have my word.
I don't believe it!
the soldiers found it. - No!
that was our...
that was our store. - They destroyed everything.
that was our food!
what is going on?
I am hiding in my own castle.
I cannot move in my own castle. Get out! Get out!
we will not leave a stone unturned, my lord. The killer will be found.
you will not leave a stone unturned, he will be found, la- di-da- di- da...
get on with it, then!
how is Gisborne doing with Locksley?
more dogs have been brought in but the outlaw is still on the run.
have you put it about that he's killed at least twice?
Yes, my lord. - Good.
do you think two deaths are enough? Hm?
to get them to really turn against him, the rebel?
if we're going to blame Hood, let's do it properly.
what do you think?
Hm?
I think maybe a few more deaths. It'd be interesting.
you know, pretty deaths, not just boys, but pretty deaths.
guards!
quickly, the cloisters.
lady Marian, come away, if you please.
how could this happen? I thought you had the castle locked down.
you must go back to your room, it is not safe here.
what is going on here? Three people have been killed under your nose.
well, that is unfortunate. - It's incompetent!
what have you achieved? You found the remnants of a picnic, -but Robin Hood, no! -At least I found something, unlike you!
shut up! Couple of women!
grow up!
forgive me, all these killings...
they are attributed to Robin Hood but what proof is there?
there were no witnesses. How could he have moved about the castle unchallenged by your guards?
and you yourself must have been there moments before the maid was killed?
that I cannot recall.
and from one point of view, the killings have been useful, no?
given you the chance to shine?
did she see you?
she's guessing, my lord. She's a girl.
do you think Will will bring some water?
a bit of bread wouldn't go amiss. Perhaps some cheese.
we're going to be captured, tortured and hanged...
and he wants cheese?
Ohh... Don't they ever give up?
master, the dogs.
we cannot stay. There 's too many of them. -Well, we must do something.
we are running away when we should be in pursuit.
the Nightwatchman is still out there.
we head east.
back to Nettlestone.
get out of our village, you're not welcome.
hello.
excuse me. Do you know if the Nightwatchman has been back here again?
has the Nightwatchman been back at all?
do you have any food? Any water? Anything. We are weary.
you'll hang for what you've done! -You killed my son!
what? Matthew's dead?
you deny it? - Yes!
Kate, you know me! - And Joderic.
you told me you'd see to him. If I'd known you would kill him...
Owen, I swear, I could never hurt Matthew.
Matthew? Don't you say his name.
don't you put his name in your mouth.
I swear, I never killed Matthew.
I didn't kill Joderic. - No, and you didn't kill those others either?
what others?
I hope they draw your guts out and quarter you.
we didn't do it! We didn't do any of it!
hold them for the Sheriff!
enough!
you don't understand! I'm fighting for you!
the Sheriff hangs people for stealing bread.
he cuts out their tongues!
he divides us...
we're going! Let's get out of here!
let me through, let me through! - Stay back!
stay there!
leave 'em be, you son of a cur!
I walked away from my home.
for them!
I gave myself up to the Sheriff for them!
we gave Joderic money for them.
I never really did understand that.
it's the tag.
I refined it. You can't copy it now.
it's only me and my dad know how to do edges like that.
it's good.
it's good.
sorry, my lady, you can't come through here.
I've come to see Sergeant Lacey.
I'll deal with this.
you shouldn't be here, Marian. It's not safe.
I know, thank you.
it's all right.
it's not though, is it?
no.
who'd have thought? Robin a killer.
all these people dead.
I can't understand.
Matthew...
his poor mum and dad...
I know how they feel.
it was the same with Ruth.
you try not to dwell on it.
remember the good times.
the only thing I regret is that she didn't die in her own bed.
that I cannot...
John!
I need you to take over.
I have to go to the castle.
enough is enough. We stop running, now!
you're not gonna give yourself in again? -Not this time.
I've got some ideas for how you could get in. -Go on.
do you want clever or really clever?
I want fast.
from here, could I shoot an arrow through that window?
pull smoothly like you're combing your hair.
you could.
but of course I wouldn't.
you're teasing me, aren't you?
Yeah, I'll say anything, I will.
I'm from the days when you could.
nowadays, we hold our tongues, those of us lucky enough to still have them.
we say one thing when we mean another.
for instance...
well, you say you want archery lessons but you're really only interested in bow range.
you're trying to prove it couldn't be him.
you still love him? - No.
who?
tell him.
not that you ever see him, but tell him.
good people do still love him.
why can it never be a beautiful woman?
call off your dogs.
Why? You're a mad killer.
you know I'm not.
it's true.
so, now we've got that sorted, what do you want to do, slit the other wrist?
it seems to me that somebody wants you dead.
well, what's new? Welcome to my world.
I came into your room unseen.
if the killer is half as good as me, he will do the same.
and your point is...?
I can catch him for you.
two questions.
how?
and why?
ride through Nettlestone Village.
parade yourself. Make sure everybody knows you're there.
that will draw out the killer and my men will shoot him.
what about my men? - Because mine are invisible.
supposing...
I agree.
Why?
innocent people are being killed.
I cannot allow that.
Oh, come on, Robin.
this is pillow talk, isn't it? Hm?
Oh, come on, you can be honest with me.
that's not the real reason, is it?
do you want to know what the real reason is?
nobody loves you any more.
Hm?
they've turned against you. The common serfs.
and really, those are the people that love you the most.
that's what you can't allow to happen.
do we have an agreement?
Oh, have I touched a sore point?
I'll take that as a yes.
and by the way, this is for you.
for future reference.
anybody wearing one of those is with me.
sweet!
Robin...
does it go with my dress?
this is my fee for saving your life.
Hm?
I'm sorry, my lady.
so, this is you with your hair down?
you cannot be here. - Shh!
do not be such a spoilsport, Marian.
I've been trying to think about who could have done this.
I think the killer is De Fourtnoy, the Master at Arms.
because?
he was right there when the maid was killed.
and a murderer on the loose merely consolidates his position.
this situation is in his interests. - Well, I intend to change this situation.
you think just because you want to change things, you can.
it's hard to change the things you do not want to change.
what about just getting away while you can? -Why? When we're having so much fun?
Oh, does anything touch you, Robin? -What does that mean?
it means you wander around as if nothing could hurt you, as if arrows would bounce off you.
I do not think I have ever seen you hurt.
Oh, I have been hurt.
tell me.
Hm? See?
you think it is strong not to feel.
but if you cannot admit you feel, how can you understand when others feel?
how can you be a whole man? - I feel when innocent people are shot down.
I feel when my men are hunted like animals.
I feel when good people turn against me.
I was talking about you to someone today.
a good man.
someone who still remembers you from the old days.
and, you know, there are still people who love you.
my lady! - One moment...
I must search your room. - Go! Out!
by the way, your investigations...
good work!
let's see if you're right tomorrow.
Shh. - My lady!
you got the Sheriff to call off the dogs?
how?
pillow talk.
have you been in bed with the Sheriff?
I brokered a deal.
we do not deal with the Sheriff.
tomorrow we save his life.
what?
can we argue about that tomorrow? Today, if there are no dogs...
I would like to sleep.
no, I have a better idea. - Another one?
if it's as good as saving the Sheriff's life, I'm with cheese boy.
did they find the food we stored at the long stone?
if we were killers, would we bring them food?
it proves we are not killers. -But they hate us.
now the mill is closed, the village will be suffering.
they will be hungry.
you just want everyone to love you. - I do not want to be branded a killer.
it is different. - You want to be loved!
and I tell you something, it's not fair.
I love you and no one gives me any food.
yet people who do not love you are fed. -Ah! Come on!
the world is wrong.
we are feeding people who do not love us and saving a man who wants us dead.
I've changed my mind.
I no longer love you. Now can I eat?
I am no killer.
I bring food to show my goodwill.
I am your friend.
my men are tired and hungry.
this is the last of our food.
Owen...
you are using us.
you and the Sheriff.
I am not.
fighting your own personal battle, using us as pawns.
what gifts will he bring later?
fellow Englishmen, your Sheriff and I bring you a gift.
that gift is a reminder that we are free and we should walk free.
today, your Sheriff and I show no fear.
today, we defy Robin Hood.
today, we walk among you to show that life goes on.
we will not hide or cower in the face of outlaws.
we will not change our lives to suit their campaigns of terror.
we hold our heads high. Laws exist to protect us.
if we allow Robin Hood to flout these laws and support him when he undermines basic justice, then where will he stop?
we give him the right to ignore another law, and another, finally to condone the taking of a human life.
for that too is a law made to protect us.
your Sheriff and I share your horror at the murder of innocents.
and we stand here today to show...
what do you think you're doing?
you're killing innocent people.
what kind of a man are you?
Marian!
you're the Nightwatchman? - There 's no time for this.
I know who's trying to kill the Sheriff.
it's Joe. - Joe Lacey?
Joe!
put it down.
put the bow down, Joe.
you let me do this, Robin.
why did you kill them, Joe?
my Ruth.
she worked all her life in the castle.
when she lay dying, where was the Sheriff?
did he come and visit? Did he send food?
no.
he sent Joderic because we hadn't paid our taxes.
he put us out and she died like a dog on the street.
and now, so will he.
you kill that Sheriff, Prince John will send another one.
and the people of that village will be tortured because the Sheriff died there.
it's just me, then.
am I the only man in Nottingham who can say what he likes? Do what he likes?
Matthew, the miller's boy?
that was an accident. The Sheriff moved.
and the Sheriff moved the next day when you killed three more?
stable boys and washerwomen?
the Sheriff's leaving. Let me do this terrible thing, Robin.
no.
put it down.
Joe, put it down.
I will shoot you.
I did it, Ruth.
I shot the Sheriff.
No!
you shot the Deputy.
my lookalike.
poor Joe.
I understand his grief. But why did he kill so many?
he didn't.
who did? - Let's go.
what now, Locksley? Hm?
Oh, I will kill you, I mean it.
I mean it.
Lacey had no reason to kill stable boys and washerwomen.
but you did.
it suited you to have people think I was the killer.
interesting idea. I wish I'd thought of it.
you did.
admit it.
how could I admit it? You swore that you'd kill me if I ever did such a thing.
I meant it.
and that's why no one will ever know.
my lord, let me send my men after him. - No, too late for that.
but I do have another job for you.
Oh, Gisborne, it's you.
excuse me.
I just came to inform you that I'm to be the new Master at Arms.
I don't believe you.
I'd need to hear that from the Sheriff himself.
that will not be possible, I'm afraid.
I have been a loyal servant.
I have... - What?
I've even killed for him.
Yeah, the Sheriff thought you might say that.
which is why I am to be the new Master at Arms.
can I ask you a question?
why do they call you the Nightwatchman when you come out in the day?
I don't normally. You know I can't be seen.
and I did not choose the name.
anyway.
you do not need to do it any more.
day or night.
now you're here, you mean?
Yes.
my father had me taught to fight.
he wanted me to have choices in the world.
and I choose to help the poor.
you are not about to stop me doing that.
but does your father know what you're doing?
he thinks I enjoy embroidery.
give me a moment?
I have a mill to open.
take this.
it's for you and Owen. In memory of your son.
John?
I hereby declare this mill open for business.
he has to have the glory, doesn't he?
glory?
no.
I think he just wants to be loved.
thank you, all of you. All of you.
the fans let him know how they feel about it.
hide the women and children. This could get ugly.
this crowd does nothing to hide its anger over this latest debacle.
the fans are mad as hell. They don't want to take it anymore.
they seem to be blaming Dixon, a good fighter, for the decline...
...not only of the heavyweight-division guys, but of the entire sport.
they're actually pelting the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world with ice.
maybe this angry, visceral reaction will pressure Dixon to fight someone...
...who can fight back for a change. If there's somebody out there.
all of boxing is hoping for a warrior who thrills us with his passion.
time goes by too fast.
yeah? Not fast enough.
your kid should've been here. That's all right.
no, it ain't all right. The kid gets a little busy sometimes.
he don't get that busy.
let's not talk about it here, okay? You're coming tonight, right?
I'm working. I took the tour the last three years.
I know, but it's the anniversary.
fine. You got my word.
I appreciate it, thank you. I owe you, Paulie.
yo, Robert. What's going on? Where have you been? You're late.
no. I don't wanna hear this. Look, your job performance...
...is nowhere near good enough to be pulling this.
I don't give a damn who your father is. You understand me?
all right. Now get out of here. Okay.
thank you, sir.
yo, Robert. Yo.
Hey, Rocky. Hey.
Hey, how you doing? Hey.
what's up, champ?
you caught me off guard. I know.
I wanted to catch you before you got busy.
Yeah, it gets busy up there.
so how you doing? Yeah? Real good. Yeah.
yo, Rock! Yeah, how you doing?
Yeah, real good.
listen, you wanna go out and get some coffee?
I'm kind of behind. Maybe later?
Yeah. That'd be great. You ought to come by the restaurant tonight.
I can have something made special for you.
tonight I can't. I got plans. A few of the guys get together.
did I do something wrong? What do you mean?
well, I don't know exactly what I mean...
...but I just think, like, when I come here, you don't feel so comfortable.
and I certainly don't wanna do that.
well, you throw a big shadow. A big shadow?
you're not gonna get anything done down here, Robert.
well, if you're not gonna introduce me, I will. Hi, I'm William Tomilson.
how you doing? Your son works for me.
it's a good job. Yeah.
I've told Robert about 20 times that I wanted to meet you.
you're pretty busy, which isn't a bad thing.
I get a little tied up. Grab a shot, will you?
I may not get this chance again. Old warhorses have to stick together.
the old horses, yeah. I'll tell you.
good thing it's not your left. This makes you popular with people.
one, two, three. Finally, we get to meet.
I gotta get going. It was nice to meet you face to face.
you take care of yourself. Robert, I'll see you later.
I gotta get going. I'll change my plans for tonight.
that'd be great. I'm looking forward to it.
how you doing? Okay.
okay. All right.
and do not let those numbers drive you crazy.
too late. Use an eraser, get rid of all of them.
yo, Rock. Hey, guys.
Hey, Rock. Hey, how you doing?
there you go.
it'll be about 10 tenths. You guys take care, okay? You got it.
I'll try a few of these later on.
it's good for baking. How much...?
yo, Paul, what's the cost? 58. 40, sir.
all right, take it out of that. I trust you.
how you doing? You're too generous.
not a problem.
how you guys doing?
how we doing, Isabel?
okay, except for the freebie reading the Bible.
he's okay. Just because you fought him...
...don't mean you gotta feed him. He doesn't look like a fighter.
spider Rico could hit.
listen, how's your stomach? It's okay.
if you keep rubbing olive oil on your stomach...
...your kid's gonna be born very strong.
okay, Rocky. Whatever you say. No, really.
yo, how you doing, Spider? God bless you, Rocky.
Thanks.
how you guys doing?
jose, can you make something special for my kid who's coming tonight?
no problem.
good. I appreciate it.
back and forth, back and forth, give and take.
and then I went in there like an animal and threw him into the corner...
...and I unloaded everything I had. Hook, hook, hook, left, left, left.
but Creed, he kept busting me back pretty good...
...and the agony began to pile up.
then I heard the best sound that I ever heard in my life...
the bell. That's right, the bell.
I ain't never been so tired, and I'm sitting in my corner.
I'm trying to figure out how to survive the last round...
...when Mickey leans into my ear and says:
come on, get out there and fight this guy hard, you bum.
"you gotta be first. You gotta be first." I said, "Yo, Mick, if I could...
I would. ...I would.
the end.
yet another quick knockout for Mason Dixon, almost perfunctory.
the fans let him know how they feel about it.
they're actually pelting the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world with ice.
Hello, Adrian's. Yeah?
tell him you can't make it? Yeah, I'll give him the message.
I just kept hearing Mickey's voice in my head over and over again.
I just dug down, and before you know it...
...it was toe to toe and it was... Excuse me.
your son said he can't make it. He said he'll take a rain check. Okay?
look at these birds.
don't these birds look like candy? Flying candy?
Hey, birdie, you wanna fly me home?
you need somebody to walk you home?
no?
it's a cold night. We need a few laughs in our life. What do you think? Maybe?
maybe? Maybe?
okay. Let's get out of here, okay?
that place ain't changed much from last year.
are we done?
Hey, how you doing, Mick?
that sign is falling apart, Paulie.
the whole world is falling apart. Look at us.
don't talk crazy, Paulie.
you know, I think if you live someplace long enough, you are that place.
I ain't no talking building.
come on, it's getting late, Rocko.
I get a headache from this train.
I remember when she was standing there...
...all nervous and shy, with this little smile.
and all I wanted her to do was trust me.
she did.
she did. You done?
how long are we staying here? Not long.
well, I'm glad they tore this ice rink down.
come on.
you heard me. I'm happy they tore it apart.
first time I walked your sister across this ice, we was over there.
she was nervous, but I wasn't so great on the blades either.
ice is stupid. People standing on ice are more stupid.
and over there, when she was falling...
...and my hand grabbed her...
...and I got her arm through that coat, I could feel it.
electric.
you said the same thing last year, Rock.
did I?
so you better develop your brain.
you're left-handed. Absolutely.
come on, Rock. Let's go.
we're done. There's no place to sit down around here.
it's all right.
it ain't all right! It's depressing and freaking cold!
what's the matter with you, Paulie?
you're living backwards, Rocko!
change the channel from yesterday! Yesterday wasn't so great!
it was to me. Not to me!
you treated her good. You had the good times.
I treated her bad. I don't have to think about this.
she always loved you, Paulie.
sorry, Rocko, I can't do this no more.
can I help you?
no, no, I used to come down to this place a long time ago.
I was just looking around. No big deal.
can I get you a drink?
all right. Maybe just a short beer. Okay.
go. Go on.
Yeah, go on. Get him to buy a round.
get him to buy a round. Go.
get him to... He's got it. He's spending money.
listen, I don't mean to cross the line or anything...
...but I read about your wife's passing a few years back.
Yeah, it was woman cancer.
Yeah. I always heard she was a nice person.
Yeah, the best.
do I know you? We met a long time ago.
we did?
when I was a kid, you walked me home.
I did? Told me to stop smoking and things.
stop smoking...
are you Little Marie that used to hang out at that Atomic Hoagie shop?
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, now I remember. I walked you home.
when you got there, you turned around and said, "Screw you, creep."
I didn't say that. Yeah, you did.
you sure? Great insults last a long time.
yo! Yo, is that you? Is that really you?
how you doing? I think he wants to drink alone.
well, then give him his drink, then. I ain't stopping you.
what's that, your man or something? No, I don't think so.
anyway, me and my friends, we're right down there.
think you could buy us a round? You got the money. Just one round.
Hey. Thank you.
what are you doing pushing my hand away like that?
what's your name? Angie. What do you wanna know for?
don't be playing a fool for that guy. A fool?
Yeah. A fool?
I'm the fool? You're the fool, not me!
you got it twisted. You're the fool. I'm a person, just like you.
you ain't no better than me. You think you're a big shot now? You're nothing.
you ain't no better than me. No better!
glad you dropped in?
I think the neighborhood is changing a little.
what was that all about? I don't know. Forget about it.
I'm gonna lock up, so if you wanna take off, I'll tally everything up.
Yeah, thanks. How you doing, Rock?
I'm good, thanks.
you live around here? About eight blocks from here.
eight blocks.
you need a lift?
all right.
did you ever get married?
Yeah, sort of. Sort of?
Yeah, well, he took off. Poof, just like that?
Yeah, just like that.
you sort of have any kids? Yeah, I got one kid.
yeah? Me too. Me too. Wonderful boy.
Hey, tough guy! What's the matter, you can't buy a round?
the girl was being nice to your dumb ass.
what you doing with that pig? Think you can disrespect us?
she ain't nothing but a jealous bitch! Come on back!
Hey, don't listen to them.
both of you, you ain't no better than me.
come over here, you'll get your head kicked in around here.
you punch-drunk, goofy bastard. You ain't no big shot, look at you.
you ain't even got a car to take that pig home.
you all right?
Yeah.
what are you doing? Don't get out. It's all right.
no, Little Marie. It ain't all right.
yo. What?
I'll tell you what. Get inside.
you get inside. Yeah, you. Hey, leave him alone!
yo, man! See it?
you see that? You see that? Yeah. All right.
what do you say? I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
get a job!
that guy sends his apologies.
okay.
Martin. Martin. Yo, Martin!
I see you still got your key.
Yeah, I got a key. You got time to talk?
I got a lot of time since your people let me go.
you know I had nothing to do with that.
Yeah.
Yeah, we moved in about a year ago.
yeah? Yeah, I mean, it's only temporary.
Yeah, I could see that. I'm gonna look for an apartment.
apartments are nice.
Yeah. It is what it is, you know.
Yeah, it is what it is.
this place used to be pretty nice. There's a lot of history around here.
Yeah. Like down the street...
...is the Cambria Fight Club.
they used to call it the Bucket of Blood.
I took some massive beatings there. But it was nice. Good memories.
and I heard these buildings are like, I don't know, 100, 150 years old.
if I was 150 years old, I'd be falling apart too. So it's okay, building.
does that light work?
no, it's burnt out or something. Yeah. Yeah?
listen, thanks for the ride, and I'm sorry about those guys.
some of those guys just got their brains on backwards and stuff.
what's he doing out so late? Is that your kid?
Yeah. Wish he wouldn't stay out so late.
amazing. Yeah, what's that?
last time I seen you, you was a kid...
...and now you officially got one of your own.
it's amazing.
you know, he sort of resembles you. He's got that big Irish hair.
Yeah, it's the other one.
yeah? His father was from Jamaica.
Jamaica? European.
was you on a cruise ship or something?
no, not really. What's his name?
steps. Short for Stevenson. Makes sense.
does he look mad at me, or is it maybe the angle I'm standing at?
no. He's a good kid.
you wanna meet him? It's getting kind of late.
I got so many things to do. Yeah, yeah, I understand.
thanks again for the ride and everything else.
I'll see you.
you too.
Hey, Steps, come on. Let's go. Say good night to your friend.
what are you doing out in the cold with no hat on?
did you get something to eat? Yeah, I already ate.
all right.
you're late, you know. I can take care of myself.
yo, Little Marie!
ain't you gonna introduce me to your kid?
how you doing, Steps? What's up?
listen, I got this place, this restaurant, nice little eatery not too far from here.
what's all this junk? Got a tissue.
sometimes I feel like a kangaroo, all the stuff in my pocket, you know.
here you go. I got a card, there it is.
and if you ever get a chance, it'd be great if both of you come down there and eat.
it'd be great, free. You know. Anyway, I'll leave it over there... Here.
I'll leave it on the steps. Steps.
see you later.
come on, let's go.
you've known what's best for you since you were 10.
since you walked in here alone.
got everything money can buy...
...except what it can't.
it's pride. Pride is what got your ass out of here.
losing is what bring you back.
but people like you, they need to be tested. Need a challenge.
that ain't gonna happen. Ain't nothing out there.
there's always somebody out there. Always.
when that time comes and you find something...
...standing in front of you that ain't running...
...that ain't backing up, hitting on you, and you're too damn tired to breathe...
you find that situation on you, that's good.
because that's baptism under fire.
you get through that, you find the only kind of respect...
...that matters in this damn world:
self-respect.
Thanks, Martin. I appreciate that.
now, what can the champ do for you?
you can give me some of that money you got.
you know, I like you, Martin. But not that much.
exactly.
how about a picture with the kid? All right?
sure.
here, son, hold up your fist. Makes you look more hazardous.
there you go. Thanks, Rock.
enjoy your meal.
he's a nice guy, isn't he? Rocky?
Yeah. Spider just went downstairs.
I don't know if that's all right. What's he doing?
I don't know. That's your friend.
yo, Spider!
let me do some dishes. I feel better. Come on. You're my guest.
let me do something. Keep eating. Guests do that.
don't make me fight you again. Last time you got lucky.
lucky? Okay.
Jesus wants me to work.
yo, Rocky. Yeah?
you've got guests.
don't get too wet, okay?
glad Jesus didn't ask you to cook.
you kept the card.
Yeah, I kept the card.
why don't you sit down? Yeah, sure.
because, you know what, I walk in there, I say good morning, I do this:
tonight, boxing once again.
two contrasting styles in almost every way.
Hey, can you turn this up? Turn this up, please.
who was the best of all time? If two athletes from different eras...
...could compete against one another, who would come out on top?
given the same rules, using the same equipment, who was the greatest?
we feed our facts into the computer.
they weigh in on who they think will reign supreme...
...while fielding the comments of our illustrious panel of sportswriters.
champ!
yo, champ! Yeah?
come check out this trash they're talking about you, man!
what you talking about? Come check this out. Hurry up.
tonight, the former two-time heavyweight champion...
...from Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa.
all right, Chuck Johnson, USA Today?
there's no question that Rocky Balboa fought tougher fights during a tougher era in boxing.
you look at Mason Dixon in his career...
...he's basically been spoon-fed his opponents.
no question in my mind. Not only does Rocky win...
...but he wins knockout.
Rocky!
offspring.
bernard Fernandez?
Dixon is a victim of his own dominance.
he's never been in real knockdown-dragout brawls.
he never had to dig down to rally back.
if he tries to dig down against Balboa...
...he'll find he doesn't have a big enough shovel.
I clearly give it to Balboa.
what happened to you? What happened to you?
boxing historian Burt Randolph Sugar.
Dixon has fought cream puffs. We don't know what he's made of.
but both in their primes, you gotta factor in...
...Dixon's unbelievable speed...
...his slashing offense. He cuts Balboa to bits.
no doubt. Dixon wins all the way.
here's where our subjectivity ends. Let's see what the computer says.
Dixon unloads on Balboa. Rocky has no answer. Balboa is eating jabs.
what time is it? Mason time.
what time is it? Mason time.
what time is it? Mason time.
now Dixon is done. He is reeling. He is almost out on his feet!
Balboa turning up the heat. Pounds him across the ring.
boy, he's bit off more than he can chew this time. Believe it.
Oh, a murderous right hook! And Dixon is out on his feet.
he is out cold as he crumbles to the canvas.
and it is Balboa who has won...
ladies and gentlemen, Baby Rocky. Baby Rocky.
I'm glad you liked the food. If you heat that up, it's pretty good in the morning.
Yeah, thanks, man.
nice kid. I hope this music ain't giving you a headache. I like this old stuff.
no, I like it. It's nice.
well, good. Good.
yo, you think Steps wants a job? Make a few bucks on the weekend?
it's good making your own G's. My kid stashed a few bucks doing that.
why are you being so nice?
I don't want you to think nothing's off, you know.
my wife, she's gone, but she ain't. You know what I mean?
Yeah, well, I wasn't thinking that. Believe me.
no? Then what was you thinking? No.
that you don't owe us nothing. What are you doing?
be patient.
now...
...I don't owe you nothing, but why do you gotta owe something to get...?
bingo.
why do you gotta owe something to get something, you know? Really.
I think hanging out with your kid would be nice. What do you think?
I think that'd be nice.
good. That's very nice.
I'm glad you come by.
it was nice watching you eat.
good company.
yo, Little Marie. Let there be light!
you like dogs? Dogs?
dogs. This is like a dog pound. It's where they keep...
...a large variety of dogs. I used to come here all the time for sightseeing.
but, you know, you learn a lot talking to dogs.
really, you do. Yeah, man. So...
Hey, man, how about this one?
he don't look too friendly, my friend.
man, this is the one. Hey, boy, how you doing?
Hey, what about this one here? Come here, boy.
who, him? Yeah, why not?
hell, no. That is one ugly dog, man.
I know, but it's kind of a cute ugly. If you look at it closely, the color...
...it looks like old furniture, like some kind of pirate-chest thing going on.
Yeah, sure, man. Hey, so how about a young one?
steps, forget him. Come over here. I want you to see something.
now, you notice what this animal is doing here? Lying in that position?
he ain't doing nothing.
no, he's doing a lot. He ain't wasting no energy.
because he's dead.
he ain't dead. There's a lot of good mileage left on that animal.
good food, the addition of a couple of new friends, bingo, he's back.
what do you think is a good name? It's your dog. You name him.
no. It's, like, a community animal. Fifty-fifty.
look, I don't know much about no dogs.
well, it ain't that complicated.
you pet him, you feed him, and nature takes its course.
you know, so... Don't you wanna name an animal?
every guy should at one time try to name an animal something.
I don't know. Fleabag?
it's catchy. It ain't original, but it's pretty good.
I think you could come up with, in your young brain...
...something better to throw out than Fleabag.
punchy. How's that?
punchy? Yeah, Punchy.
I like it, you know. For real?
Yeah, for real. Punchy it is. It's easy to remember, it's not that hard to spell.
and once it's in your brain, you never forget it. Punchy. Very good.
all right, man. Good call.
all right, Punchy. You ready to get bailed out, my friend?
okay.
Hey, you know it was a joke, don't you?
Yeah, I know. You're a very funny guy.
Rocky?
the fans let him know how they feel about it.
excuse me. Sure.
this could get ugly.
rock. Yo, Paulie.
they're gonna be talking about that fake Looney Tune fight.
Hey, come on. We're about to serve today's special.
italian food cooked up by a bunch of Mexicans ain't so special.
Hey, yo.
Hey, I skipped work for this.
what an ugly dog.
it's a cute dog.
Hey, Rock. Yeah?
I'm gonna take off. That stuff back there is pretty cool.
Oh, you like that? Yeah, man.
Thanks, I appreciate it. I'll catch you later.
all right.
who's the criminal? He's a nice kid.
he dresses like a bum.
coming from a human hamper, that's quite a compliment.
hide the silverware.
that's nice.
Hey, Spider.
didn't you knock out that bum once?
will you give it a rest?
I'm gonna be late for work for this. Give me a break, huh?
all right. Just for a few seconds.
in the late '60s, a simulated fight took place between two legends...
...Muhammad Ali and Rocky Marciano.
Marciano long retired, and Ali unable to fight legitimately...
...for three years for having refused induction into the armed forces...
...was in need of money, and agreed to the dream match...
...whose outcome would be decided by a computer.
it's almost 35 years since Rocky Marciano won the much-disputed computer decision...
...and guess what? Not much has changed.
last week, Rocky Balboa won a decisive fight...
see? That's the cartoon fight I'm telling you about.
Yeah.
a stunning knockout.
keep in mind, this is taking the human factor out of it.
the computer says Balboa... Beautiful.
...would be triumphant, KO 13. And here's some of the fallout:
what started as a simple form of entertainment...
...has become a rallying cry for people who think...
...an old-school athlete like Balboa could actually be better.
computer technology has to create what isn't. That's just not responsible.
get therapy, will you?
how do you think Balboa would have done against Dixon?
badly. Personally, I think Balboa was completely overrated.
he owns a restaurant in South Philly.
what's the specialty, pounded chicken?
anyway, I would have paid to see the fight. Next topic, NAS CAR...
...and the controversy that won't go away.
let's go back to Sunday's race...
Hey, hey, hey, cheer up.
it's free advertisement. Come on. Meat house calls.
yo, Robert.
what are you doing out so late?
I tried calling, but nothing was picking up.
is something wrong? I just wanted to come by...
...and see you in person. Wanna come inside?
no. I just wanna get your opinion on something.
sure. Opinion on what?
you know, they say you only go around once, right?
Yeah, I've heard that. Well...
...I think I wanna, like, do something.
like what? Fight.
you know, nothing big. Small stuff, like locally. You know.
don't you think you're too, you know, old?
you think you ought to stop trying things...
...because you had a few too many birthdays? I do not.
people will think you're crazy.
what's crazy about standing toe to toe saying, "I am," you know?
that's just ego talking.
what are you trying to prove to other people, Pop?
prove? Listen, I stopped thinking...
...the way other people think a long time ago.
you gotta think like you think.
I do. Do you? Good.
you gotta face reality, okay? It's a different world now.
only the clothes is different.
I really don't know what you want from me.
I just wanted us to get involved. You know, like, home team.
look, whatever it is, whatever you're going through, it'll pass.
Yeah, you're probably right.
time is gonna catch up to all of us.
especially if you're standing still. Hey, come on.
look, I'm gonna call you in the morning.
did you tell this to your kid? Yeah, I did.
What'd he think, you're nuts, right? Yeah.
Oh, well, he don't believe in you? Welcome to my world, buddy.
Rocko, nobody's giving you no title shot.
I know that. I don't want one.
so this isn't a mental disturbance?
no.
you're mad because they took down your statue?
no.
not really, no.
if it's about money, just hang a sign around your neck saying, "Punch me."
five dollars, you'll make big money.
what? You haven't peaked yet?
peaked? Yeah, peaked.
I don't know. There's still some stuff in the basement.
what basement? In here.
tell me about the stuff.
what about it? Tell me about the stuff inside.
is it angry? Angry?
are you mad because Adrian left you?
she didn't leave, Paulie. She died.
okay. Okay, okay, okay.
you know, sometimes it's hard to breathe.
you know, I feel, like, this beast inside me.
it's okay, Rocko. Please, it's okay.
is it okay?
I just never knew it was supposed to be this hard.
it wasn't supposed to be like this, Paulie. You know, it...
so you wanna come by and help me train?
I got a job here.
I understand.
remember you said if you stay one place long enough...
...you become that place?
Rocko, this is all I got.
I understand, Paulie. I do.
if you get time and come down and see me train, I'd appreciate it.
of course, Rocko.
Bye, Paulie.
goodbye, Rocko.
goodbye, Rocko.
take care, Rocko.
this plenary session of the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission...
...is convened in order to consider the application of Rocky Balboa...
...for the issuance of a discretionary professional boxing license...
...due to his ineligibility to be licensed as a matter of right.
Mr. Balboa, you're welcome here. Since you're representing yourself...
...we invite you to make an opening statement, if you'd like to.
no, I was just curious how I did, that's all.
all right, well, the Medical Advisory Board has informed us...
...that the battery of tests to which you've been subjected...
...you've passed these tests with flying colors.
and we congratulate you for that.
Thanks. However, this commission...
...in good conscience, cannot recommend you for a license...
...and we therefore deny your application.
didn't I do what you asked? Yes, you did.
so I should get a license, right?
not exactly.
so why did you give me all them tests if you was never passing me?
we've gotta stand by our decision here...
...and we have to deny your request for a license at this time.
yo, don't I got some rights?
what rights do you think you're referring to?
like in that official paper they wrote down the street?
that's the Bill of Rights. Bill of Rights.
don't it say something about going after what makes you happy?
no, that's "the pursuit of happiness." But what's your point?
my point is I'm pursuing something, and nobody looks too happy about it.
but we're just looking out for your interests.
I appreciate that, but maybe you're looking out for your interests more.
you shouldn't ask people to come here and pay the freight on something.
they pay, it still ain't good enough. You think that's right?
maybe you're doing your job, but why you gotta stop me from doing mine?
if you're willing to go through all the battling to get where you want to get...
...who's got the right to stop you?
maybe you got something you never finished, something you wanna do.
something you never said to somebody, something!
and you're told no, even after you pay your dues.
who's got the right to tell you that? Who? Nobody!
it's your right to listen to your gut. It's nobody's right to say no...
...after you earn the right to be what you wanna be or do what you wanna do!
the older I get, the more things I gotta leave behind. That's life.
the only thing I'm asking you guys to leave on the table is what's right.
yo! Have you seen the paper today?
front row. Front row.
that is so great.
all right, all right. Let's go get some food. Food.
let's get a beer. Come on. Come on.
the last two pay-per-views were in the toilet.
you're not making heavyweight-championship money.
there's a bunch of nobodies out there, Mase.
I wanna talk to you about an opportunity we should run with.
look at me. You heard Rocky Balboa applied for a license and got one?
I heard. Forget about him. Hear me out.
you want me to fight a guy I can beat with both hands tied behind my back.
everybody knows you could beat him sitting down. That's not what it's about.
it's about making money. We gotta capitalize on that computer fight.
this could do a million buys. That's 15, 20 million to you.
forget it. No one's beating the door down...
...to watch you fight anymore. We got guaranteed fights.
you wanna do this now in front of your friends, we'll do it now.
we got nothing. All the pay-per-view fights you come up with got rejected.
you know why? They're all bums out there. Nobody cares about them.
there's no marquee value. But this Balboa thing is interesting.
I don't wanna do it. Listen to me.
it's a has-been, never-gonna-be world. Call it nostalgia, whatever you want...
...but people relate to that stuff. This is a no-lose. It's all good.
good for who? For you! Not for me! For you!
maybe you don't understand. People don't like you no more.
they don't follow you. They're not supporting you anymore. Understand?
don't look at me like I'm messing with your legacy.
every jock now thinks they got a legacy.
a legacy is what you get instead of getting paid. That's a legacy.
don't talk to me like I'm stupid. I'm not no more.
everybody knows you could kick this old man's ass. But you don't.
leave him with a little dignity, so they say:
Mason Dixon's got compassion. He's a decent guy, he's a nice guy.
you get a whole new audience, we'll double your money.
you want a new image? That's how you get it.
to replace the one that you two made?
whoa, wait. We made your world green. You made the rest.
this is you. You made all this junk happen.
I've had it up to here with this mess.
time for me to make changes. I'm going to Martin's gym.
we'll talk about it. Forget this crap.
I want Martin back. There's nothing to talk about.
how you doing? Hey, what a surprise.
I was driving around the neighborhood, I thought...
...why not drive by and say hello? You wanna come inside?
no, the dog needs some exercise. You wanna take a little walk?
Yeah, yeah. All right. It's nice outside.
all right. Nice and brisk.
when did you get a dog?
we picked up Punchy a couple of days back.
punchy? Yeah.
you named your dog Punchy?
your kid come up with the name.
Oh, yeah? I think that's disrespectful.
Oh, no, no. It's fine, really.
no, it's easy to remember and it's all that, you know.
listen, what do you think about coming over to the restaurant?
what for? Well, you know, for, like...
for work. The hostess is gonna be having a kid. You'd do good.
I don't know. I'm telling you, you'd do so good.
I appreciate what you're doing for my kid, but I can't.
Hey, listen, I think you'd like it a lot.
it's a nice environment, it's very pleasant.
Yeah, can we drop it?
what's bothering you?
nothing. It's all right. Listen, I gotta get back.
no, it ain't all right. Oh, come on.
what? I'm gonna be the first person...
...people see when they walk in? You give out menus.
you say, "Hello, how are you?" You sit people down.
look, if I can do it, anybody can do it.
you could find 10 better people, a hundred better people for this job.
give it a try, like two weeks.
I don't wanna try.
who put this stuff in your head? Nobody.
well, it just don't get in there by itself.
thanks for coming by.
yo, when was the last time you went dancing? Has it been a while?
why are you asking? I'm asking because...
...you dance around these problems, you might as well dance with me.
I ain't that good, but I'm better than the average bear.
where that came from, I don't know.
you're crazy. A little bit.
but the way you're thinking and talking, it's a little crazy too.
come on, you deserve better. Really. Come on over.
I need you to class my place up. Philly needs you.
and if you say, "Screw you, creep" again, I totally understand.
but I'm warning you, I'm gonna put myself...
...in the middle of the street here...
...and stand here, me and Punchy, and wave to the first bus, say:
come on over here and mash me!
little Marie turned down the job at the restaurant.
she thinks she's better than us.
Oh, yeah? Well, there hasn't been a bus down here in 20 years.
yeah? No.
that was a close call.
listen, seriously. Come on over. It'd be nice.
all right.
Paulie!
sorry, Paulie.
sorry.
how are you? Get my unusual up there.
excuse me. Deliveries are in the back.
I'm not a delivery guy.
well, do you have a reservation?
do I look like a freaking Indian?
Hey, Rock? Rocky?
I think we've got a little bit of a problem with this guy.
problem? No, no, he's just a relative.
Oh, okay.
yo, Paulie.
what happened to your eye? I hit it.
Why? Needed to.
what happened?
I'm celebrating, Rock. Why?
I retired. Retired?
so when did they start giving retired people meat...
...instead of watches, Paulie?
I don't need a watch.
I got a watch! You gave me a watch!
Paulie...
I don't need no goddamn watch.
yo, Paulie. I got a watch!
I got two watches!
yo, Paulie!
yo, Paulie.
rock.
it takes guts climbing back in that ring, knowing you're gonna take a beating.
you're gonna do all right, Rocko.
how do you know that?
the stuff in the basement.
Thanks, Paulie.
Hey. Hey, Rock, how are you?
you okay? Yeah, good. How are you?
Yeah, fine. This is great. Good.
listen, some guys over there wanna talk to you.
okay. You got it. Okay?
thanks for coming by. I appreciate it. Our pleasure.
wanna hear stories? What kind of stories?
well, a lot of people like to hear these old fight stories.
maybe later. Okay.
I'm Lou DiBella. This is L. C. Luco. He's Mason Dixon's manager.
will you sit down and join us? Sure.
you know, we have the promotional contract for Mason Dixon...
...who's a big fan. Really?
when he heard you were interested in fighting...
...he thought why not try to work something out?
like a special event. Like a first-class exhibition fight.
why me? He respects the hell out of you.
all right? And let's be honest, that computer fight got people curious.
this could be very interesting. I ain't interested in getting, like, mangled and embarrassed.
no, that's not gonna happen. Never happen.
truthfully, I was thinking more on a, like...
...miniscule, small level. You know. Small fights, not big fights.
small fights. Things that... Local. You know what I mean?
not a bad idea. Don't think of it as big. Think of it like an exhibition.
think of it as a glorified sparring session. Here's something you'll like.
we're gonna donate a portion of the gate to charity.
that's always nice. It's good to give.
Yeah.
Where's it taking place?
Las Vegas. Las Vegas.
nice and warm. This cold's gotta be killing you.
little stiff. You move better when you're warmer.
Yeah. And if nothing else... you'll have new stories to tell.
I really gotta think about this. Absolutely.
is that okay? I understand. No problem.
I'm gonna go over there. You can order something.
what do you recommend? It's all edible.
okay. Thanks.
we got him. Imagine if Dixon met this bastard in his prime?
he'd kill him. Kill him. You ain't kidding.
man, I'm confused.
I didn't think this was gonna come along.
but this is what you wanted, right?
I don't know. You know, I talk and I talk.
sometimes I think what I'm saying is true...
...and then I look at myself and I'm not even sure what is true anymore.
because it's like, I pushed this crazy idea about fighting.
I mean, what's it all about?
do I really care about standing toe to toe and all that stuff...
...or, like my kid says, is it just, like, ego?
or am I this old pug who's just trying to replace old pain with new pain?
I don't know. I don't know.
look, I know I usually don't say a lot.
I'm always listening and looking.
but who you are, the part of you that's so full of life...
...we all have that feeling, that fire...
...but usually never get a chance to use it. And then it just goes away.
but you can. You've got this opportunity, so do it. Why not?
I mean, this is who you are. This is who you'll always be.
and you don't move aside for nobody until you're ready to move.
and it doesn't matter how this looks to other people.
all that matters is how it looks to you.
rocky.
rocky, look at me.
how it looks to you.
and if this is something that you wanna do...
...and if this is something that you gotta do, then you do it.
fighters fight.
you're not gonna punch me, are you?
listen, I gotta go before I wear out my welcome. I'll see you tomorrow.
Thanks.
fighters fight, right?
it's rare when you get to promote an event bigger than boxing. This is.
skill versus will, with part of the proceeds going to charity.
the brainchild of Mason Dixon, to honor past heavyweight champions.
warriors like Rocky Balboa. Let's open it up for questions.
Hey, champ!
a few great fighters have fought in their 50s, often with disastrous results.
why risk the danger and embarrassment?
the smart money says you have virtually no chance.
a puncher always has a chance. This fight will be competitive.
why are you doing this, Rocky?
I don't know, I'd rather do something I love badly than...
than to feel bad by not doing something you love.
rocky, the press has labeled you a Balboasaurus.
how do you feel about that?
let's say the following happens: You win, we'll say you beat an old guy.
you lose, say a thumb in the eye, you'll be the joke of the decade.
you all know that will never happen. This is only an exhibition.
don't go trying to make more out of this than that computer tried.
isn't this sport in enough trouble without these circus events?
next question. On the surface, this looks like...
...a cheap bit of ring theater between, no offense...
...a has-been and a man whose own credible legacy...
...and popularity is in doubt.
what's the upside? Doubt?
upside? I mean...
what do you mean, upside? I mean, what do I have to do?
you know, I'm 33-0 with 30 knockouts.
I'm doing you people a favor. I'm having this exhibition for you.
you gonna get up here and make a mockery out of me? I'm the champ.
I mean, I get pissed, this guy get hurt.
see you at the fight.
the guy's a joke. He's gonna get crushed.
look who's here. How you doing?
have you seen my father? He's in the back.
this place has never served this many meals. It's unbelievable.
you're doing good? Hope you're enjoying everything, all right?
excuse me.
how you doing? Glad you come by.
can I talk with you?
sure. Can we do it outside?
so you're going through with this? I start training tomorrow.
Hey, Rock. I made some connections.
I can make some money on this, endorsements.
Absolutely. Do that.
thank you, Rock. Okay. Sure.
so you nervous about the fight? Scared to death.
you don't look scared. Well, I ain't supposed to.
then you don't have to do it.
Yeah, well, I think I do.
you know, living with you, it hasn't been easy.
people see me but they think of you.
now with all this going on, it's gonna be worse than ever.
it don't have to be. Sure it does!
Why? You've got a lot going on, kid. What, my last name?
that's the reason I got a decent job.
that's why people deal with me in the first place.
now I start to get a little ahead...
...I start to get a little something for myself, and this happens.
now, I'm asking you as a favor not to go through with this.
this is gonna end up bad for you, and it's gonna end up bad for me.
you think I'm hurting you? Yeah. In a way, you are.
that's the last thing I ever wanted to do.
I know that's not what you wanna do, but that's just the way that it is.
don't you care what people think? Doesn't it bother you that people...
...are making you out to be a joke and that I'll be included in that?
do you think that's right? Do you?
you ain't gonna believe this, but you used to fit right here.
I'd hold you up and say to your mother:
this kid is gonna be the best kid in the world.
this kid is gonna be somebody better than anybody ever knew.
and you grew up good and wonderful.
it was great just watching, every day was like a privilege.
then the time come for you to be your own man and take on the world...
...and you did. But somewhere along the line, you changed.
you stopped being you.
you let people stick a finger in your face and tell you you're no good.
and when things got hard, you started looking for something to blame...
...like a big shadow.
let me tell you something you already know.
the world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.
it's a very mean and nasty place, and I don't care how tough you are...
...it will beat you to your knees and keep you there if you let it.
you, me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.
but it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit...
...and keep moving forward.
how much you can take and keep moving forward.
that's how winning is done!
if you know what you're worth, go and get what you're worth.
but you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers...
...saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody!
cowards do that, and that ain't you! You're better than that!
I'm always gonna love you no matter what.
no matter what happens.
you're my son and you're my blood.
you're the best thing in my life.
but until you start believing in yourself, you ain't gonna have a life.
don't forget to visit your mother.
Yeah, those are beautiful. Yeah.
you get off early from work? No.
I left.
I quit.
quit, why?
I wasn't very...
I don't know, I just... I didn't fit in there.
I understand.
so, what are you gonna do? Right now?
right now I'd rather be with you.
is that all right?
Yeah.
it's been a long time since I seen a fight.
you know all there is to know about fighting...
you know all there is to know about fighting...
...so there's no sense us going down that same old road again.
to beat this guy, you need speed. You don't have it.
and your knees can't take the pounding, so hard running is out.
and you got arthritis in your neck. And you've got calcium deposits...
...on most of your joints, so sparring is out.
I had that problem.
so what we'll be calling on is good old-fashioned blunt-force trauma.
horsepower. Heavy-duty, cast-iron, pile-driving punches...
...that will have to hurt so much they'll rattle his ancestors.
every time you hit him with a shot...
...It's gotta feel like he tried kissing the express train.
Yeah! Let's start building some hurting bombs.
Yeah, you'll get it. You can do it, Rocko!
getting stronger!
up! Up! Up! Come on!
go!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
come on, Rocko!
come on. Come on. Let's hit them. Hit them.
you can do it, Rock.
getting stronger!
up, up, up! Go! Go!
all right!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!
rocky Balboa, 217!
the undisputed heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon, 221!
thank you very much. I appreciate it, champ. Thanks a lot.
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
know how much money is in this? A lot of it.
imagine trying to clean this place.
no, seriously. Balboa!
you guys, I'll catch up with you all later, okay?
Robert, why don't you hang with me?
how you doing, champ? I'm good.
no reason for neither one of us to get hurt in this fight.
I'll do my best to carry you, make sure you save face.
there'd be no embarrassment.
but I promise you, you try to press me, you hit me, you hurt me...
...you hit me low, cheap-shot me, I'll get you out of there.
you know, a lot of people come to Vegas to lose. I didn't.
it's already over.
ain't nothing over till it's over.
what's that from, the '80s?
that's probably the '70s.
just remember what I said.
Hey, yo, champ.
yo, ain't you a little scared?
I don't get scared.
I think you try a little harder when you're scared.
this is what has worked for me.
I ain't scared. Oh, yeah. You ain't scared of me?
come on, let's see what you got. Come on.
Hey, don't hit me, I'm brittle.
Hey. Hi.
how you doing? I was just thinking.
did you wanna come in? No, no, no, it's okay.
I just wanted to...
...I don' t know, come by and wish you good luck for tomorrow.
Thanks. Yeah.
I brought you something.
I hope you don't mind, I took it from the restaurant.
no. Thanks.
Adrian.
Yeah. Thought she would keep you safe.
Yeah. Yeah, she always brought me luck.
Yeah.
I wanted to say thanks for everything you've done for me and my kid.
you've been great and...
you know, tomorrow...
...you're gonna prove that the last thing to age on somebody is their heart.
I'll try. You go show them.
thank you.
the heavyweight championship has been...
...one of sports' most coveted titles for 120 years.
two-time heavyweight champion Rocky Balboa...
...the Philadelphia slugger, renowned for his cast-iron jaw...
...ferocious body attack and will of steel...
...all of which have carried the smaller fighter to victories...
...over the years against physically superior opponents.
and Mason Dixon, the current heavyweight title holder...
...with all the speed, determination and confidence any fighter could want.
but many still question whether he has the heart of a true champion...
...never having been pushed to go the distance. Tonight, we find out.
here at the Mandalay Bay Event Center in Las Vegas...
...for the much-anticipated showdown...
...between Mason "The Line" Dixon...
...and Rocky "The Italian Stallion" Balboa.
Hello, I'm Jim Lampley with Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman...
...live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas, where we anticipate...
...one of the most outrageous and compelling events in boxing history.
the unappreciated heavyweight champion, Mason "The Line" Dixon...
...putting his reputation on the line...
...against legendary ex-champion, Rocky Balboa.
even though most see this as more of a glorified sparring session...
...the energy in the room is electric.
Larry, why is this billed as an exhibition?
wild guess: So they wouldn't have to call it an execution.
Zacariah 4: 6 says, "It is not by strength, not by might...
...but by his spirit we have already claimed the victory in our Lord Jesus Christ."
good luck, Rocky.
Thanks, Spider. Appreciate it.
nobody's expecting much, I think, from the way-past-his-prime...
...former champ, Rocky Balboa.
rock, I gotta talk to you.
look, I know you got a lot of stuff you gotta get out of your system.
tonight you do it. Right? Get rid of the damn beast...
...Let it be done, once and for all. Please, I love you.
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
there go the lights. The buzz is building toward a roaring crescendo.
where did that come from?
I told you. I love Sinatra.
he's very good, Sinatra.
let's go. Very good.
and here comes Rocky Balboa, veteran of the wars...
...Here for one more last hurrah.
or the Last Supper, perhaps, with him as the main course.
what's that music? You can't be serious.
high Hopes? Talk about wishful thinking.
well, maybe no hopes is more realistic. Anyway, the crowd likes it.
look at the Italian Stallion. Cool and relaxed.
Rocky's an off-the-board underdog, and they don't care at all.
this is about his pride and dignity and his punch, guys.
the last thing to go is a guy's punch.
rocky always has that puncher's chance.
rocky Balboa is still, as you can hear, the people's champion.
prediction, guys: For at least two rounds...
...Dixon's gonna have his hands full.
two whole rounds? We have a cockeyed optimist in the house.
how you doing? The crowd wants to see...
...something real, or at least...
rocky Balboa just asked me how I'm doing.
I grew up watching this guy. I never thought I'd be calling one of his fights.
this is unbelievable. I'm a fan, I can't help it.
now here comes Mason Dixon.
Mason Dixon establishing his presence in the ring.
and suddenly now a conversation breaking out at ringside.
Mike Tyson calling out Mason "The Line" Dixon.
you can't call no shots here. I'm the champ.
you not doing nothing. This is charity work.
you got that midget with you right there.
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Mandalay Bay...
...resort and casino of Las Vegas.
and a special main event of the evening...
...10 rounds of heavyweight excitement...
...sanctioned by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.
and when the bell rings, the referee in charge of the action, Joe Cortez.
and now, for the thousands in attendance...
...and the millions watching around the world, ladies and gentlemen...
...let's get ready to rumble!
introducing first, fighting out of the blue corner...
...wearing black with gold, official weight, 217 pounds.
his professional record, 57 victories including 54 knockouts...
...with 23 defeats and one draw.
he is the fighting pride of Philadelphia...
...the two-time heavyweight champion of the world...
"the Italian Stallion"
...Rocky...
...Balboa!
hope he gets his head busted.
shut up.
across the ring, fighting out of the red corner...
...wearing white with blue, official weight, 221 pounds.
he has a perfect professional record, consisting of 33 bouts...
...33 victories, including 30 knockouts.
originally from Tampa, Florida...
...but now fighting out of Las Vegas, Nevada...
...the reigning undisputed, undefeated...
...heavyweight champion of the world...
Mason "The Line"
...Dixon!
all right, gentlemen.
all right, Mason, Rocky. We went over the rules in the dressing room.
I expect a good, clean fight. Watch the kidney punches, rabbit punches...
...low blows, be careful with those. Give me good sportsmanlike conduct.
remember, gentlemen, I'm fair but I'm firm. Touch them up!
enjoy the ride. The champ is not in the best shape...
...we've seen him in. Maybe he plans to phone this in and go home early.
that wouldn't be a surprise. Glad you could make it.
one thing about Rocky we know for sure:
this guy's showing up in shape.
the old man's crazy. He's gotta be crazy. He's in here.
okay. Take it easy. This is an exhibition.
all right? Do it to him.
you got three rounds to set a pace. Every time you hit him, make a dent.
got it. The moments before a Rocky Balboa fight? I can't believe it's here!
round one begins.
if old George Foreman shocked the world with one punch...
...why can't old Rocky Balboa?
and as much excitement as there is in the arena...
...there's a sense of foreboding as well.
and now, Mason "The Line" Dixon goes to work with his jab as though...
...he's fighting against the number one challenger in the heavyweight division.
see, this is to be expected early on.
you knew the champ would control the distance with his jab...
...his height, his range.
Balboa looking to get in a shot, misses wildly.
did you like that?
it looks like a speed bag against a punching bag.
Rocky's understandably frustrated...
...but he came out of retirement to get into a fight.
guys named Rocky don't like to be toyed with.
one punch could still turn it around.
apparently he forgot his arthritis meds this morning.
rocky misses.
there's a meat-seeking missile on the point of the chin by the champ.
more pinpoint jabs by Dixon. Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
and there's a hard right hand and a left and a right by Balboa!
he drives Dixon into the ropes with a series of shots!
and the crowd goes berserk!
Dixon punishing Balboa for the temerity of landing those shots.
it's toe to toe in the corner. Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.
Balboa landing potent combinations to the head of the champion.
a wake-up call for Dixon.
you all right? Yeah, I'm all right.
the man's got bricks in his gloves. Where's the stuff in the basement?
it's still there. He came to battle, okay?
trying to knock me out. Listen.
if there's a bone he can break, he's gonna do it.
give the man respect. What about my respect?
CompuBox numbers tell the grisly story here.
Balboa landed nine of 13 punches in that round.
Dixon landed an incredible 59 out of 69.
why don't you listen to me? Rocky's been here a million times.
coming out to start a round after he took a beating in the previous one.
remember what I said, okay? I warned him. I warned him.
he's tired. His legs are going fast, or already gone.
and what's truly extraordinary is that Rocky can still take it.
the boxing commission, which was criticized for licensing him...
...would be massacred if something happened to Rocky.
and a monstrous straight left hand! Down goes Rocky!
and that could conceivably be the end of the fight!
that could be the exhibition right there. But no. Balboa up.
referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants to continue, and Rocky says yes.
even Rocky Balboa could be too brave for his own good.
Dixon comes right back to try to finish it. Balboa almost went down!
rocky actually shoves Dixon back.
as Dixon lands these brutal shots.
cover up! Cover up! Open shots at close range.
right and left hands, and down goes Balboa!
perhaps for the last time in his fighting career!
that should do it. Three! Four!
get up! Get up! Seven!
how do you feel, man? You okay? Now Rocky is furious with himself.
he convinces Cortez he wants to keep fighting.
Dixon's pointing at the ref to end it.
rocky waving his arms and saying he's fine.
he wants to go on! Let it go! Let it go!
and Balboa comes back! With a left and a right...
...and bulls Dixon into the ropes for the second round in a row!
back comes Dixon with brutal left-hand shots.
Dixon hurt his hand there! Go after him!
this is Rocky's best chance!
the champ obviously hurt his hand on Rocky's hip!
and Balboa immediately going to work to the body! Huge right hook!
Balboa ripping away at Dixon's body! These are big punches.
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
Yes!
rocky Balboa has knocked the reigning heavyweight champion down!
you hurt him! Mason "The Line" Dixon...
...has never taken this kind of punishment...
...in his entire professional career!
maybe he's clearing his head, but the body shots really caved in his ribs.
Balboa is thinking knockout himself!
another counter hook by Balboa, followed by two more!
Dixon fires back his own hooks! Now Rocky's stunned.
it's an all-out war along the ropes...
...as round two comes to a close amid a giant tumult in the ring!
incredible.
all right!
welcome to Rockyland.
how's the hand? My hand's broken.
we lose, it's your ass! Your ass!
it will numb up on you in a few rounds.
once that hand numbs up, Dixon will be able to throw it hard.
until then, here is Rocky's chance.
no reverse! Take the pain, champ.
stay on him! Everybody thought this was a joke, including me!
now nobody's laughing! Stay on him! You go get him!
go out strong!
keep him off you!
that's it! That's it!
you won that round. Break him down.
bomb him! Bomb him!
Yeah!
just keep throwing them bombs!
come on.
you can do this.
Rocko. Rocko.
Yeah, come on, go!
go through him! Run over him!
unload on him!
get down, Mason!
they're leaving nothing on the table, guys.
the fans are still standing. They may not be able to sit down for a week.
you're doing great! I'm doing better than I thought.
you sure he's okay? I've had worse.
toe to toe, one round to go. Who would've believed this was possible?
can you see out of that eye? Let me talk to him.
don't take any more chances than you have to.
there's nothing more to prove, Pop. There's nothing more to prove.
I gotta go out the way I gotta go out.
you can do it, Rocko!
one more round, we go home. Okay, then do it.
there's an old saying that every great champion has...
...one great fight left in him, and Rocky is proving it so far.
come on. Touch them up. Rocko! The last round of your life!
come on, guys. The last round!
come on. Touch them up, let's go. Touch them up.
you are one crazy old man. You'll get there.
let's go.
tenth round of a scheduled 10. Who would ever have dreamed...
...that Rocky Balboa would still be in this quote, "exhibition," against...
...the heavyweight champion? You can do it! Come on!
this fight is as though Dixon got on-the-job training in courage.
cover up! Cover up! They're both in a pain-free zone!
these guys are fighting in another dimension right now!
beyond belief! Balboa just walking straight into Dixon's punches.
target practice for Dixon.
they're exchanging right hooks! Balboa's drilled!
here comes Dixon! He's exhausted from just punching the man!
knock this bum out, Mase!
what is it you said to the kid? It ain't about how hard you hit.
it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.
how much you can take and keep moving forward.
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Get up.
let's go! Get up! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
get up.
another monster body shot. Rocky's ancestors must have felt that one.
come on, Rocky! Start moving those hands!
less than two minutes to go.
the crowd is astonished that Balboa got up.
come on! Turn it over! All the way through!
and retaliates with fury!
chop him down!
come on, Rocky! Come on!
take him out now!
they're trading shots again!
Balboa is trying to hit anything and anywhere!
win it! Win it!
Yes!
Yes!
you're a great champion. You got heart.
thanks for the opportunity. Good man.
that was unbelievable. That was the greatest thing I've ever seen.
you did it. That's the kind of fighting you're talking about.
Hey, Paulie.
that beast is gone now. The beast is out.
one of the most overused words in sports, guys, is "incredible.
I hate to say it. This is incredible.
let's go!
ladies and gentlemen, before we go to the scorecards...
...a round of applause for these two heavyweight warriors!
we have a split decision.
adelaide Byrd scores it 95-94...
...Dixon.
Chuck Giampa has it 95-94...
...Balboa.
and Bill Graham scores it 95-94...
...for the winner by split decision, and still undefeated...
...the heavyweight champion of the world...
...Mason "The Line" Dixon!
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
you know, I couldn't have done nothing without you.
yo, Adrian, we did it.
we did it.
good night, Claus.
sunny, you know I love you.
good night.
and the next day?
Maria's testimony was wildly exaggerated.
sunny was never moaning.
maybe the occasional snore, but...
and Maria shook Sunny?
nobody ever shook Sunny.
what happened when she regained consciousness?
after the first coma, it was kind of absurd.
everybody was angry at me.
can't you ever leave me alone?
why did you do it?
I would have been better off. You would have been better off.
what do you want me to say? That I'm sorry I saved your life?
Yes.
say it.
of course I'm not sorry.
Claus.
what am I going to do with myself?
when I phoned Alexandra...
...to tell her what happened, she said the same thing.
why did you do it? Why did you call the doctor?
you told me she wanted you to let Sunny die?
no. It was more:
everybody says Sunny is such an unhappy woman and...
...has nothing to live for.
well, so much for the first coma.
the second, of course, was much more theatrical.
theatrical? Is this a fucking game?
this is life and death. Your wife is lying in a coma.
you don't even make a pretense of caring, do you?
of course I care, Alan.
it's just I don't wear my heart on my sleeve.
let's call it a night, okay? Okay, guys.
as you wish.
there were three drugs on the needle. Amobarbital, valium, insulin...
we can't all be you, Alan.
get a doctor to prepare five needles.
one with nothing. Two with valium, amobarbital and insulin.
two with just Valium and Amobarbital.
we'll send them to the same lab and see if we can get a false positive result.
if we don't?
if we don't, then I clean the latrines.
you're not going to believe this.
david Marriott wants money. -Who doesn't?
I'm afraid his memory might fade. -Forget about him.
well, he has lost his crummy job and he is trying to find evidence for us.
we'll treat him like a government witness. We'll pay him for his time.
what's his time worth? -$1. 50.
Sarah! Dersh!
your team's on!
are you going to pass to me this game? -No.
their investigator said the needle had a small encrustation near the tip.
doctors tell us this is totally inconsistent with injection.
so how did it get there?
if I inject this needle, the skin acts as a kind of a swab.
it cleans the needle off, leaving the tip completely free of liquid.
but, if I just dip the needle into the liquid...
...what do you see?
dry this out, you have an encrustation.
so it's a frame-up?
it's Desdemona's handkerchief.
my stepchildren thought I was guilty and concocted evidence to prove it.
this should win us the case, no?
no. We're maybe halfway home.
there's still a lot of weird stuff.
did you love Sunny? -I married her.
of course I loved her. She was beautiful.
rich. -Why not?
what I've seen of the rich, you can have them.
I do.
the black bag. Was it yours?
sunny appropriated it.
to understand that, you must understand that after the first coma...
...she went into a complete rage.
where are they? Did you take them?
certainly not. Take what?
my pills, you moron!
valium, Seconal...
you took them, didn't you?
I've long since stopped interfering.
well, who? My children wouldn't dare.
I know who. -Where are you going?
Maria!
she soon found them.
it's my lovely mother, isn't it?
she's behind all this.
she's in cahoots with Maria.
well...
...just because she had all the money before I had all the money...
...does not mean she's my lord and master.
of course not. I am your lord and master.
just kidding.
Maria loves me too much.
it's unhealthy for her.
and it's certainly no fun for me.
there.
we'll see if my ugly little maid can sniff this one out.
what will you do with all that?
I'm not going to tell you.
I assure you, it won't be among my affairs.
odd. She used that word, "affairs."
you realize the prosecution thinks you ground up the drugs to inject Sunny.
frankly, this nose-drop business is pretty far-fetched.
but consider the pattern, Alan.
it's public record that Sunny used drugs.
her behavior here of hiding them in liquid...
...so that no one will find them...
...is like your classic alcoholic stashing whiskey all over the house.
you're right.
of course. I mean you've always been right, haven't you?
this is the most dangerous case I've ever worked on.
you find that exhilarating?
no, I do not. I am breaking every rule.
to win, I must proclaim your innocence and I've never done that for anybody.
the problem is, I see who you are. You'd do anything to win.
so would you.
Yeah, but you don't trust the legal system.
are you saying I'd manufacture witnesses? Affidavits?
no, but you would sacrifice me. -Oh, please.
the more I believe you're innocent, the more nervous I am.
I go out on a limb for you. You're proven guilty. I look like an asshole.
my reputation, my credibility, my career, are destroyed.
that's the risk you're taking, isn't it? -Well, fuck you.
fuck you, man!
I'm glad we understand one another.
it's easy to forget all this is about me...
...Iying here.
to most of you, my name means "coma."
my second marriage means "attempted murder."
everything beautiful that came before...
...does not exist in the public mind.
no one thinks of how I loved my children. Look at Cosima...
...and Alex, of course, and Ala.
certainly no one cares about Claus, how he was when I fell in love with him.
when Claus and I first met, I was married to the dashing young Prince Alfred Edward.
it was 1964.
seven years into my first marriage.
it seems that my first husband, Alfred, as he was called...
...had vowed to be unfaithful with every pretty girl in Europe.
he was having quite a success.
and so...
...I was unfaithful with Claus.
wildly unfaithful.
happy memories.
but it's not the passion I remember most.
it's the tenderness.
there's one of Frank's pets.
I never liked people much. Not as a rule.
but Claus was somehow different.
not a normal person, I guess.
it's all right. Do it again. Give him some more.
one of those things you never forget.
of course, now he lives in my apartment.
my bedroom.
my bed.
cold, isn't it?
cold and brutish and the way of the world.
looking at him now, the issues seem simple.
is he the devil?
if so, can the devil get justice?
and all this legal activity...
...is it in Satan's service?
sunny von Bulow was totally vulnerable...
...to Claus von Bulow.
can't argue with that.
but it's speculation. Exaggeration.
keep working on it. -Totally inflammatory.
what is this? Illegal search?
it's a classic technicality. A guilty man's argument.
this is different. Usual Fourth Amendment, you're trying to exclude evidence.
same thing here.
no, this search destroyed evidence. No fingerprints, no inventory.
what's left hurts Claus, but the State has an obligation.
the cops tested the drugs from the illegal search, right?
and we are saying that test constituted a second illegal search.
there are precedents.
I know the law's on our side. I'm not debating that.
what I'm trying to do is-- -No, you're debating me, personally.
Why?
I'm debating strategy. Okay?
I'm not debating you. We're all on the same team, aren't we?
I don't know. We seem to be.
then why don't I feel it?
I thought this was professional. -It was.
that's bullshit!
I asked you to work on this case because I think you're a good lawyer.
I think you're a great lawyer, too.
but you give everything to law and forget the people you care about!
my clients are the people I care about. -Obviously.
what I care about, all I fucking care about, is this!
this case!
and making the best possible appeal we're capable of, okay?
you can make your argument better. You know that. I know that.
so why not just do it and cut out all the bullshit!
you always have to have the last word, don't you?
what?
we're going to lose.
why do you think this case fascinates people?
because at one time or another, every man is driven crazy by his wife and secretly...
...wants to do exactly what Claus is accused of.
kill her in some sly, silent way...
...that can't be detected. Claus is a scapegoat.
someone has to suffer for the sin we all want to commit.
Alan, that's ridiculous.
it's ridiculous. You're right.
what have you got?
the prosecution's case is based on a theory.
the needle in the bag, plus insulin on the needle, plus insulin in her blood.
okay, fine.
in Derek, this Rhode Island Supreme Court, these same judges...
...said that in a case based on circumstantial theory...
...the case falls apart if any part of the theory is weak.
lf a chain has a weak link, it's thrown out? -Exactly.
Peter, that's good. It's very good.
this is good. -Thank you.
what do you want me to do now?
I want you to find as many alternative theories as possible.
come on. There's only seven days left.
Dersh? I'm sorry, but you'd better come downstairs.
Dersh, sorry to get you out of bed.
what do you want, more money? -Can you get more?
can I have a glass of water, please?
no. The reason I'm here is my affidavit is inaccurate.
great. Just what I need right now.
swell.
I left something incredibly important out.
remember I gave Alex's drugs to a woman at Clarendon Court?
Yeah, so?
that bitch was definitely Sunny von Bulow.
this looks bad. I've met with you about five times. Now all of a sudden...
no. It's not sudden.
I think I always knew, but I became convinced by staring at pictures of her.
we can't use your affidavit unless it's truthful.
are you sure this time?
I swear on the body and soul of my mother.
poor woman.
put in this change and make him go over every word of the affidavit.
can I use your men's room?
more money? -Can you get more?
if Claus had injected her, he would have thrown away the needle, right?
sure, if he threw away the insulin, why keep the needle?
Claus is strange, but he aren't stupid.
he's arrogant.
is that a crime? -Sometimes.
why are we even discussing this? It's obvious. The kids framed him.
you've changed your tune.
a frame-up doesn't mean he's innocent.
the kids could have framed a guilty man.
Dersh! Telephone!
it's Peter Macintosh.
you know what it is?
word in Rhode Island is that the State can't lose. It has an ace up its sleeve.
what is it?
he's going to try to find out.
all right, my friend. -"Friend"? I like that.
nothing personal.
no students, no witnesses. Second coma. Let's hear it.
strange as it may seem now in retrospect
Claus, cut the bullshit. December 20, 1980.
sunny was unwell.
we'd been arguing all afternoon.
I'd at last been offered a new position in the oil business...
...which would have meant my spending some time in Europe.
the discussion must have escalated, because I went to talk to the children.
this cargo will bring 50, 000 gold florins...
...for any rebels worth the name.
50, 000 florins!
that's a pretty good take!
I have something to tell you both.
it looks as if...
...as though, mummy and l are going to have to split up...
...because my work is something she just cannot tolerate.
mummy says things like that...
...but she always gets over it.
Yes, but this has been going on for too long.
I'm going to Europe for a few months in the new year.
this will probably lead to a split.
it's all right, she'll get over it.
alexander says that conversation happened the next day.
what could be more absurd than announcing your intention...
...to divorce a woman who has just fallen into a coma?
that evening, everything seemed normal enough.
not cheerful.
but then we didn't usually giggle at mealtimes.
despite her doctor's warnings about sweets...
...the only thing Sunny consumed was a sundae.
after supper, I went to finish some work in my study.
the others decided to chat in the living room.
that'd be lovely, but...
...I need to go to my room for just a minute.
after about an hour, I dropped in on them.
darling, would you care for anything?
if there's some chicken bouillon left...
I'll look.
here you are, darling.
thank you.
how is your work coming?
I'm totally flummoxed. The figures just don't make sense.
why don't you call your friend Deborah?
I doubt she'd be in Saturday night.
so Deborah, I think you'll agree that's 728.
but Deborah was home and we did talk for some time until...
Claus. -Hold on.
come quick. Mummy's not well.
Deborah, can I call you back in the morning?
her voice got weak and she almost fell.
somebody open a window.
I find the chill reassuring.
now I must speak with Claus. -Good night, Mummy.
that is, if Claus has time to talk.
or are you going to work every spare moment through Christmas?
is your work really so fascinating?
or are you trying to drive me away? If you are, it's succeeding beautifully.
because I don't want this. I didn't marry you for this.
with my money, I could have had anybody!
well?
say something!
do something!
be a man!
I already have a butler.
do something!
I don't want this. I don't.
I don't want this! Please, I don't.
I don't want this!
the same conversation as the previous year...
...only this time, with greater venom.
you've always been afraid of me.
it's not because of my money. It's because you're a coward.
because your pitiful masculinity is so fragile, you can't stand confrontation...
...so you go off with Miss Botsky-- -Good night.
as was usual, I was awakened before dawn.
I let the dogs out, as was customary.
I went back through the bedroom, to my study, as quietly as possible.
I did not notice if my wife was in bed.
I did not notice if the light was on under the bathroom door.
had it been on, I wouldn't have given it a thought.
I did my exercises, showered...
...and then I called Deborah Knowles.
it's stable and profitable.
can anyone really believe, if I was trying to murder my wife...
...that I would spend an hour going over a tedious set of figures?
after the call, I passed through the bedroom again. It was freezing.
by this time, Sunny was certainly not in bed...
...and I heard water running in the bathroom.
then I had breakfast, walked the dogs...
...and on my return, I asked the children where mummy was.
has Mummy had breakfast yet? -No. We haven't seen her.
her bathroom was her private sanctuary. No one entered it...
...except the maid to clean up.
sometimes she stayed there for hours, or so it seemed.
one can only speculate what goes on behind a closed door.
sunny, are you there?
I hesitated even to knock.
darling?
Oh, God.
once I'd ascertained she was breathing, I went to fetch Alexander.
why not call an ambulance first?
panic, Alan, panic.
I needed to talk to somebody.
I wasn't worried that she was breathing normally.
it wasn't like the year before.
in retrospect it seems absurd, but...
...I looked at her upper lip with blood on it. I thought she'd broken a tooth.
that was the extent of my concern.
that's really all I can...
that's really all I can say.
but is it the truth?
of course.
but not the whole truth.
I don't know the whole truth. I don't know what happened to her.
I wish I didn't believe you.
it's very hard to trust someone you don't understand.
you're a very strange man.
you have no idea.
everybody here? -Peter's late. Says he's got bad news.
there he is.
I found out what the State has, their ace in the hole.
it's you.
me?
david Marriott taped all his conversations with you.
great.
the scuttlebutt is, if we win the case...
...you go to prison.
what did I say?
a friend of mine got me an excerpt.
the reason I'm here is my affidavit is inaccurate.
this looks bad.
what do you want, more money? -Can you get more?
Yeah.
that is not what I said.
it's on tape. -I don't care if it's on tape. I didn't say it.
what do we do? -I don't know.
we ignore it, that's what we do.
with that tape, it's your whole career!
I now believe Claus is innocent. So...
...we've decided. No tricks, no technicalities...
...we are going to base our appeal directly and explicitly on Claus's innocence.
that's not proper. An appeal must be based on judicial error.
it is. The judge should've thrown out the case.
how can you say that when a jury convicted him?
good point, but-- -That's what we're saying.
if the rules don't work, you change them.
auerbach got the jump ball rule changed when the Celtics had a short team.
but it's dangerous politically. If the judges feel insulted.
the Supreme Court shouldn't even look at an appeal based on new evidence.
Hey, guys. I'll take care of it, okay?
just leave it to me.
I know you're all exhausted.
we got four days left.
what we do now will decide this thing. Do you want to win or not?
we got something. -We've hit the jackpot.
our needles that had Amobarbital and ...
...but no insulin...
...both came back with false positive readings for insulin.
one was 93, the other 282.
we've knocked out every piece of their medical case.
okay, now all they've got left is my neck.
anybody know anything about editing audio tapes?
defense, for what?
defense! Come on!
all right, Alan.
wait. I got it. Where's Raj? -He's upstairs.
I got it.
remember Maria?
she could 've said it like this.
insulin?
for what, insulin?
my lady is not diabetic.
you see?
my lady is not diabetic.
she is assuming that the bag is Sunny's!
her first, instantaneous reaction, not part of a legal strategy devised later...
...is that the stuff in the black bag belonged to Sunny, not Claus.
who would know better than she?
start writing.
you are not God! You are a prosecutor!
alabama cannot execute the Johnson kids before the Supreme Court rules!
that's right! You heard me.
you've two hours to get to Rhode Island. -You want me to commit a crime?
of course not. If you get stopped you'll miss the deadline.
I'm telling you, buddy, if those kids fry, you're next!
you're damn right!
some startling developments in the von Bulow case.
harvard law school professor, Alan Dershowitz...
...had been accused of paying for falsified testimony.
those accusations were discredited today by the Rhode Island Attorney General...
...who announced that David Marriott's tape was doctored...
...and that Marriott is not a reliable witness.
what was he up to, Alan? Who was he working for?
damned if I know.
hope they don't think he was working for you.
no one will-- -I don't think you did it...
...but at the Chinese restaurant, you did duck the big question.
Chuck is our Alexandra lsles expert.
sunny's aspirin overdose.
why did she take so many?
what happened? Sunny had a headache?
the headache was Alexandra, right?
let's hear it, Claus.
Alexandra was spiteful.
on the day of Sunny's...
...aspirin overdose...
...she returned some presents I'd given her.
some photographs, love letters.
she dropped them off in a shopping bag.
did Sunny see them?
sunny was home.
I was not.
Alexandra neglected to address the package to me.
I want to be left alone with all those beautiful letters.
what did you do with those letters? Why did you write them?
there's a big difference between knowing about an affair...
...and having love letters crammed down your throat.
seems that Sunny did care about your affair.
she cared a lot.
why didn't you tell us?
everything was open book.
get the best experts. I'm not afraid of the truth.
looks to me like Alexandra tried to force Sunny into suicide.
or they plotted it together.
either way, he's protecting Alexandra, because he's still in love with her.
and why not? She's a babe.
of course I still love her.
and hate her.
Alexandra, Sunny...
...Andrea.
I love them all.
being a human being is very literal. You're trapped.
time moves in only one direction, forward.
it's stupid and boring and results in a lot of silliness. Example.
the legal process.
in this particular case, a vast amount of time, effort and money were spent...
...trying to determine what happened...
...on those two nights so close to Christmas.
december 26, 1979.
december 20, 1980.
it happened right here.
even now, it all looks the same...
...feels the same, smells the same.
if you could just go back in time and take a peek...
...you'd know.
and all this would be unnecessary.
all rise!
all persons having business before the Supreme Court...
...for the State of Rhode Island may now draw near.
then again...
...everyone enjoys a circus.
if the appellant is ready, you may proceed.
oral argument will be made by out-of-state counsel...
...Professor Alan Dershowitz.
your Honors, you may not like Claus von Bulow.
you may think he is guilty of something, but I'm here to tell you he is innocent.
our new evidence clearly indicates-- -Professor...
...you know there is no case that allows you to introduce new evidence on appeal.
but there is one, your Honor...
...and you wrote it.
Derek.
in Derek...
...you yourself said...
...that a case based on circumstantial theory...
...rather than fact, only stands up
the only way to show a better theory is to present it.
get on with it, Counselor.
the first issue is the encrusted needle.
I hope you will have the courage to free an innocent man...
...and remedy a grave injustice.
this will never work.
he's too smart for his own good.
alan says it will work...
...if the prosecutor takes the bait.
what do you mean, "bait"?
argues the evidence.
your Honors...
...introduction of new evidence on appeal...
...violates every principle of jurisprudence...
...every statute, every precedent, every rule of ethics.
he's nailing us right off the bat.
I am not going to argue Mr. von Bulow's guilt.
however, I have no choice but to address...
...Mr. Dershowitz's arguments one by one.
Bingo!
first...
...the matter of the encrusted needle.
so, now it's up to the judges. Tell me what you really think.
I think it's easier to love somebody than to live with them.
love is fantasy...
...living is work.
and those people don't like to work.
but, if you don't do the work, the love dies...
...and nobody wants to deal with that one.
the love died.
sunny couldn't accept it.
so, Claus tried to kill her? -Maybe.
I don't agree.
all we had to do was prove that the State made a lousy case.
we didn't prove that Claus was innocent. We didn't have to and he probably isn't.
he isn't? You think-- -He didn't inject Sunny with insulin.
so what? Break it down. First coma.
no problem. Even the doctor thought that it was caused by hypoglycemia.
all right.
but what about the second coma? Why does Claus act so guilty?
wouldn't any man feel guilty if his wife was suicidal?
so, maybe she took the sleeping pills...
...with the intention of killing herself.
but how did she end up lying on a marble floor...
...in a freezing bathroom with her head under the toilet bowl?
how about this?
sunny wakes up miserable.
second marriage is over. Children are leaving home.
what's to live for?
but, when she was found, her nightgown was hiked over her waist.
exactly. How did it get there?
let's say she's standing at the sink. She has to pee.
at exactly the same instant, the drugs hit.
her body convulses. She grabs the nightgown.
I don't buy that.
it does seem far-fetched.
so does the truth, sometimes.
I think she took the barbiturates the previous night.
and let's say he saw her take them...
...or she told him she was going to before they fell asleep.
this time he wants her to succeed.
maybe there's some way he can help her along.
of course. The open window.
zero degrees.
somebody might see her there.
the action of dragging her would naturally pull up the nightgown.
in this cold, how long could she survive?
remember what Sunny said?
I would have been better off.
you would have been better off.
the law is a blunt instrument.
it is not a rapier. It is a cudgel.
tomorrow, death penalty!
which reminds me of the comedian who said:
why do they call it the death penalty? That's no penalty, you're out of the game!
good news. -Great news.
and more good news! -The decision came down?
they've just announced it. -5-0.
we murdered them.
grounds?
we got the Brillhoffers. -That silly, "guilty man's" search argument.
federal or state? -Both.
that's important?
if it's federal, they could appeal it in the U. S. Supreme Court, but not if it's state.
don't get too excited until we see Brillhoffer's notes.
we destroyed their medical case...
...but their witnesses still carry emotional weight if there's a second trial.
unless...
...the Brillhoffer notes show that they've changed their stories.
you have Brillhoffer's notes? -Yes.
they're not what we hoped. -I knew it.
they're much better.
no one mentioned seeing insulin when they first talked to Brillhoffer.
plus...
...Maria told them that at Thanksgiving when she supposedly saw the insulin...
...she couldn't even read any of the labels. They were all scraped off.
what does this mean? -lt means...
...that if there is a second trial, we can be reasonably confident.
both the medical case and their witnesses are now highly suspect.
darling...
...this is Alan Dershowitz.
Yes, I know. Hello.
alan tells me things look very hopeful.
I knew it would come out all right. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. I am eternally grateful.
this means we'll be getting back your bail. A million dollars!
I know I still owe you, Alan.
please send me your bill.
and maybe when you're in New york...
...we can meet for lunch. I'd enjoy that.
one thing, Claus.
legally, this was an important victory.
morally, you're on your own.
Claus von Bulow was given a second trial...
...and acquitted on both counts.
that is all you can know.
all you can be told.
when you get where I am...
...you will know the rest.
two packs of Vantage, please.
anything else?
Yes. A vial of insulin.
just kidding.
wake UP.
wake UP, SLEEPY HEAD.
took the cursed sheet again you hairy bastard.
all these bad dreams u have.
U should pay extra.
be QET, WOMAN.
POSCA.
Lucius VORENUS.
your MONTHLY DEBAUCH IS FINISHED ALREADY?
I SEE YOURS ISN'T.
this? THIS IS NOTHING.
this IS FOR MY NERVES.
where IS HE?
Oh, WHERE IS HE?
Oh, A DEEP QUESTION.
his MORTAL FLESH IS IN THE THRONE ROOM MEETING THE DELEGATION FROM THE SENATE.
they're HERE ALREADY? - YES.
senator BIBULUS AND SEVERAL OTHER DISTINGUISHED MEN WHOSE NAMES I FORGET ARRIVED THIS MORNING.
and WHY ARE YOU NOT IN THERE?
I VALUE MY LIFE, SUCH AS IT IS.
when THE QUEEN GROWLS AT ME, I RETREAT.
hmm.
it's NOT COWARDICE.
who WOULD LOOK AFTER MY WIFE?
Antony: YOU SHOULD LEAD THE ANIMAL ON SLIGHTLY.
you SEE? DEPENDING ON HOW FAST HE'S GOING.
drink THE WATER.
now HERE'S THE MOMENT
the ANIMAL THINKS ONLY OF HIS THIRST.
he KNOWS THERE IS DANGER.
but HE CANNOT RESIST THE WATER.
easy, YOU SEE.
my TURN.
Antony, IF WE MIGHT DISCUSS THE MATTER AT HAND?
Shh! - SHH!
you'll SCARE OFF THE DEER.
Oh. - HE MOVED.
the BEAST MOVED! - AGAIN.
regarding THE GRAIN SUPPLY...
I HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO OFFER YOU DOUBLE THE PREVIOUS PRICE IF YOU CAN GUARANTEE DELIVERY BEFORE THE END OF THE MONTH.
double YOU SAY?
that's NOT BAD.
Oh!
triple. - AGREED.
we WILL PAY TRIPLE THE CORRECT PRICE.
and CARTHAGE.
Carthage WILL BE ANNEXED TO ANTONY'S CONTROL.
that MAY BE POSSIBLE.
poor OCTAVIAN, EH?
he MUST BE REALLY DESPERATE.
people ARE STARVING, DYING.
Octavian WILL DO WHAT HE MUST TO PREVENT FURTHER SUFFERING.
because HE LOVES THE PEOPLE SO.
he DOES. - HE LOVES NOBODY AND NOBODY LOVES HIM.
he COULD FEED THE PEOPLE LARKS AND OYSTERS TILL THEY BURST, AND THEY WOULD STILL LOVE ME MORE.
isn't THAT RIGHT, VORENUS?
Yes, SIR.
there WE ARE. THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE.
they LOVE ME.
I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU ARE RIGHT, BUT WE DO HAVE AN AGREEMENT, YES?
Yes.
triple RATES...
and CARTHAGE.
and SPAIN. - SPAIN?
you CAN'T HAVE SPAIN.
Oh?
Oh, THAT'S A SHAME. NO DEAL THEN.
really, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY-- - NO DEAL.
Oh, BRAVA, MY LOVE!
venison FOR DINNER, THEN?
pleasant VOYAGE HOME, BOYS.
get HIM OUT OF HERE.
I'll SHOW YOU TO YOUR QUARTERS.
is HE ALWAYS LIKE THAT? - LIKE WHAT?
well, IF THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE LITTLE SHIT DECLARE WAR,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL.
he's A CAUTIOUS BEAST.
perhaps YOU SHOULD SIMPLY CUT THE CORD
and DECLARE WAR YOURSELF.
declare WAR...
on OCTAVIAN?
on MY MOST TRUSTED AND BELOVED COLLEAGUE?
on ROME? ON MY OWN PEOPLE? NO NO NO.
no, THAT WOULDN'T DO.
when I RETURN HOME IT WILL BE AS A SAVIOR, NOT AS A CONQUEROR.
I'm VERY TIRED.
Helios.
selene, OFF WITH YOU. OFF WITH YOU.
can't YOU SEE YOUR FATHER NEEDS TO SLEEP?
where ARE YOU GOING? STAY.
you CAN HEAR THEM.
what ARE YOU GONNA DO? BAKE 'EM A CAKE?
Oh, DIS.
I FORGET SOMETIMES WHAT A COLD-HEARTED BITCH YOU REALLY ARE.
would YOU HAVE ME ANY OTHER WAY?
are YOU JOKING?
anyone OFFERS ME A GOOD HORSE WITH THE LEATHERS THROWN IN...
- ...YOU'RE GONE.
man: BACK! BACK!
keep OUT OF THE WAY! GET OUT OF THE WAY!
let HIM THROUGH.
clear THE WAY.
man: MY FATHER IS STARVING.
silence.
Silence!
the DAY'S RATION HAS BEEN GIVEN.
there'll BE NO MORE UNTIL TOMORROW AT THE APPOINTED TIME.
all: NO!
I KNOW YOU'RE HUNGRY.
but YOU'RE ALIVE.
if I DO AS YOU ASK AND OPEN THE GRANARIES,
you'll BE WELL-FED TODAY AND STARVING TOMORROW.
go HOME.
go HOME AND SUFFER WHAT THE EARTH MOTHER HAS SENT US.
and COME BACK TOMORROW.
right.
still IN ONE PIECE THEN, EH?
thought THEY MIGHT HAVE ATE YOU.
too MUCH GRISTLE ON THE BONE.
Lucius, GIRLS, I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO WAIT INSIDE.
I'll NOT COWER WHEN THERE'S BLOOD TO BE SPILLED.
Where's THE HONOR IN THAT?
when YOU'VE GOT HAIR ON YOUR CHIN YOU CAN TALK OF BLOOD.
VORENA, I EXPECTED BETTER. NEXT TIME DO AS YOU'RE TOLD.
they're JUST HUNGRY PEOPLE. THEY'D NOT HURT US.
hungry PEOPLE DO STRANGE THINGS.
then BLESSED ORBONA WILL PROTECT US.
well, RUN ALONG AND ASK HER TO SEND A GRAIN SHIP.
me AND MASCIUS HAVE TO TALK.
you TOO, LUCIUS.
go LEARN TO READ OR SOMETHING.
ha!
what's THE TALLY?
10 DAYS LEFT, A QUARTER RATION, GIVE OR TAKE.
gods BELOW.
hardly WORTH GIVING OUT.
just PROLONGING THE MISERY.
morning.
the BAKERS' GUILD MAN WAS 'ROUND EARLIER.
I TOLD YOU NOT TO SPEAK TO THEM.
nor DID I.
he SPOKE, I SAID NOTHING.
they're OFFERING 600 A SACK.
Yeah, 600 AND A FEW DEAD CHILDREN
for EVERY SACK THAT DOESN'T GET TO THE PEOPLE THAT NEED THEM.
we're NOT IN THIS FOR PROFIT.
still, IT'S 600.
I PISS ON THE BAKERS' GUILD.
your CALL. - YES, IT IS.
why ARE YOU WASTING VALUABLE FOOD ON HIM STILL?
let THE POOR BASTARD DIE.
memmio?
no. HE REMINDS THE OTHER MEN TO STAY HONEST.
what's TO BE DONE, THEN?
fetch MY BEST CLOTHES. I'LL SEE IF HIS HONOR HAS ANY IDEAS.
Hey!
quiet, YOU.
eh!
you FUCKING HAIRY BASTARD.
so FAR IT'S JUST THE OLD AND THE SICK THAT ARE DYING.
but BY NEXT MOON, OUR GRANARIES WILL BE EMPTY.
I UNDERSTAND THAT DOGS MAKE GOOD EATING.
they DO.
taste LIKE PORK IF YOU COOK 'EM RIGHT.
all GONE. - AH, I WONDERED WHY THE NIGHTS WERE SO PEACEFUL.
no BARKING. - THIS IS NO MOMENT FOR WIT.
I WISH THERE WERE SOMETHING I COULD DO.
but THE STATE GRANARIES ARE NEAR AS EMPTY AS YOURS.
I CAN ONLY GIVE TO YOU BY TAKING FROM SOMEONE ELSE.
the MILITARY SILOS ARE UNTAPPED.
and THE ANMY NEEDS TO EAT.
well THEN, SEND THREE LEGIONS TO AFRICA.
let LEPIDUS FEED THEM.
that WOULD SUPPLY THE CITY WITH ENOUGH GRAIN FOR A MONTH.
have IT DONE.
it's ONLY A TEMPORARY SOLUTION, BUT IT'S THE BEST WE CAN OFFER.
I'll SEND YOU WHAT WE CAN SPARE. - THANK YOU.
Pullo.
tell ME WHAT THE PEOPLE ARE SAYING.
tell ME WHO THEY BLAME FOR THIS FAMINE.
you, THEY SAY.
you're THE MAN IN CHARGE.
not ANTONY?
they HEAR THE NEWS READERS SAYING
that HE'S HOLDING BACK THE SHIPMENTS AND ALL THAT.
but, WELL, IT'S ANTONY, ISN'T IT?
why WOULD HE STARVE THEM?
they've ALWAYS LOVED HIM AND HE'S ALWAYS LOVED TO BE LOVED.
whereas YOU...
well, YOU'RE YOU, AREN'T YOU?
cold AND HEARTLESS?
I'll NOT SAY THAT.
but YOU'VE NEVER BEEN THE AFFECTIONATE TYPE, NOW HAVE YOU?
thank YOU, PULLO.
I'll BE HEARING ABOUT THE GRAIN THEN, WILL I?
agrippa WILL SEE TO IT.
perhaps BIBULUS WILL SUCCEED? - NO, HE WON'T.
Antony's NOT ENTIRELY IRRATIONAL.
given ENOUGH MONEY, WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE?
Antony's NOT MOTIVATED BY MONEY.
he HOPES THE PEOPLE WILL RISE UP IN ANGER AND DEPOSE ME.
either THAT, OR HE SIMPLY WISHES TO PROVOKE ME INTO DECLARING WAR ON HIM.
has HE REALLY BECOME SO FOOLISH?
who KNOWS WHAT HE'S BECOME AFTER ALL THESE YEARS OUT THERE?
who KNOWS WHAT CLEOPATRA WHISPERS TO HIM?
he WAS ALWAYS A FOOL FOR HIS WOMEN.
if HE WANTS A WAR, WHY NOT GIVE IT TO HIM?
hmm, YOU HEARD PULLO.
you MIGHT AS WELL DECLARE WAR ON WINE AND SONG.
no NO NO.
war ON ANTONY IS DOOMED UNLESS THE PEOPLE ARE WITH US.
send FOR MY MOTHER AND SISTER.
I SHALL HAVE DINNER WITH THEM THIS EVENING.
girl: GRANDMA?
you SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
Oh!
it's DANGEROUS.
antonia, WHERE ARE YOU?
she's UP HERE WITH ME. I'LL BRING HER DOWN.
you NAUGHTY GIRL.
what HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT GOING ON THE ROOF?
I SWEAR ON DIANA, I SHALL HAVE SOMEONE BEAT HER.
she DOESN'T LIEN TO A WORD I SAY.
Oh, SHE'S A GOOD GIRL, REALLY. JUST LIKE YOU WERE AT THAT AGE.
and I TURNED OUT SO WELL?
your BROTHER, ON THE OTHER HAND, WAS AS BIDDABLE AS A SHEPHERD'S DOG.
no TROUBLE AT ALL.
castor, ARE THERE ANY LETTERS FOR ME TODAY?
no, DOMINA.
strange.
I HAD THE STRONGEST FEELING THAT TODAY WAS THE DAY.
mother? THERE WILL BE NO LETTER.
you're WRONG.
sorry TO BE BLUNT, BUT
but DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME TO FACE FACTS?
Antony PROMISED HE WOULD SEND FOR ME AND HE WILL.
even IF HE DID, DO YOU THINK OCTAVIAN WOULD LET YOU GO?
I DON'T GIVE A FIG.
truly, IS HE WORTH TORTURING YOURSELF LIKE THIS?
domina?
Octavian CAESAR SUMMONS YOU BOTH FOR DINNER THIS EVENING.
what DOES HE WANT NOW, I WONDER.
nothing TO OUR BENEFIT.
family AND FRIENDS, EH?
nothing BETTER.
Octavia, I HAVE A FAVOR TO ASK OF YOU.
- YOU ARE AWARE OF THE GRAIN SHORTAGE, I SUPPOSE?
you KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE ARE DYING IN THE STREETS FOR WANT OF BREAD?
and YOU WANT ME TO FEED THEM?
in A MANNER OF SPEAKING.
your HUSBAND HAS PLENTY OF GRAIN IN YPT.
but HE IS PLAYING POLITICS WITH IT, HOLDING IT BACK.
if YOU WERE TO GO AND TALK TO HIM...
I?
go TO EGYPT?
the SOFT VOICE OF A LOVING WIFE MAY SUCCEED WHERE ALL ELSE HAS FAILED.
you ARE JOKING!
I CANNOT REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I MADE A JOKE.
last MARKET DAY.
you SAID SOMETHING ABOUT FISHES WHICH MADE ME LAUGH QUITE DISTINCTLY.
I WAS SPEAKING FIGURATIVELY.
if YOU ARE SERIOUS, IT IS NOT I WHO SHOULD GO, BUT MOTHER. SHE'S HIS REAL WIFE.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT GO TOGETHER, PRESENT ANTONY WITH BOTH REALITY AND APPEARANCE.
Oh.
that's ALL VERY WELL, BUT...
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO TAKE A LONG SEA VOYAGE.
do YOU?
no.
BESIS, WE'RE NOT HUNGRY.
and WE NEED NO GRAIN.
so WHAT'S IN IT FOR US?
how WILL YOU PAY US FOR OUR TROUBLE?
what DO YOU WANT?
hmm.
Pompeii's BECOME VULGAR.
I'd LIKE A VILLA IN CAPRI.
that's FINE.
what ABOUT YOU, OCTAVIA? DO YOU WANT A VILLA?
um, I DON'T KNOW.
a VILLA WOULD BE NICE.
some GLADIATORS WOULD BE FUN AS WELL.
why NOT TAKE CASH AND DECIDE LATER?
good IDEA.
cash. - AS YOU WISH.
MAECENAS, HAVE THE NEWS READER
announce THEY ARE LEAVING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
I LIKE BIRDS.
I DON'T LIKE EGGS. THERE IS SOMETHING QUITE SORDID ABOUT EGGS.
we SHAN'T SERVE THEM ANYMORE.
unless YOU OBJECT, OF COURSE.
why ARE YOU SENDING ATIA AND OCTAVIA TO EGYPT?
you HEARD WHY.
well, YES, BUT THAT CAN'T BE THE REAL REASON.
you KNOW ANTONY WILL REFUSE WHAT THEY ASK.
it's VERY LIKELY.
Oh.
what?
you CALCULATE...
that IF ANTONY TURNS OCTAVIA AWAY,
the PEOPLE WILL FEEL THAT HE HAS PUBLICLY HUMILIATED HIS DARLING WIFE, THAT QUEEN CLEOPATRA HAS BEWITCHED HIM,
and THEY WILL ALL TURN AGAINST HIM.
something LIKE THAT.
but ON THE OTHER HAND, IF ANTONY STILL LOVES ATIA AND YIELDS TO HER PLEADING,
then SO MUCH THE BETTER.
you'll HAVE YOUR GRAIN.
clever BOY.
good NIGHT, MY DEAR.
I WISH YOU'D STOP THAT.
we'll GET THERE NO FASTER.
have I CHANGED AT ALL, DO YOU THINK, SINCE HE LAST SAW ME?
no.
you're JUST EXACTLY AS YOU WERE.
he'll FALL INTO YOUR ARMS IN A DELIRIUM OF LOVE.
do YOU MEAN THAT?
no.
U've BECOME VERY MEAN, YOU KNOW.
mean AND BITTER.
you've BECOME GIRLISH AND SENTIMENTAL.
it's DISGUSTING, FRANKLY.
no POINTS. NO POINTS.
I WASN'T READY.
- HA!
10 POINTS TO ME.
well DONE, MAJESTY. WELL DONE.
ready? - NO, WAIT!
I BEG THEE! WAIT!
useless OLD WOMAN. GO AWAY.
Vorenus, PLAY WITH ME.
throw IT PROPERLY.
come ON, THEN.
good CATCH.
tell ME MORE ABOUT MY FATHER.
I TOLD YOU ALL THAT I KNOW.
you've TOLD ME ONLY WHAT EVERY FOOL KNOWS.
he WAS A GREAT SOLDIER, THE PEOPLE LOVED HIM, BLAH BLAH BLAH.
tell ME WHAT HE WAS LIKE AS A MAN.
well, HE WAS
he WAS A GOOD MAN.
he WAS A GOOD MAN TO HAVE AS A FRIEND.
you WOULDN'T WANT HIM AS AN ENEMY.
he HAD A NASTY TEMPER WHEN HE WAS ROUSED.
when THE BATTLE WAS GOING HARD AND MEN WERE FALTERING, THAT'S WHEN YOU'D WANT TO SEE YOUR FATHER AT YOUR SIDE.
bravest MAN I'VE EVER KNOWN.
more.
fine HORSEMAN.
bad GAMBLER, THOUGH HE'D NEVER ADMIT IT.
he LIKED THE WOMEN.
he LIKED TO EAT.
he'd EAT THE WHOLE TABLE IF YOU'D LET HIM.
Really?
I've ALWAYS HEARD HE WAS VERY...
ABSTEMIOUSN HIS DIET.
Yeah, WELL, THAT WOULD BE RIGHT.
there's OTHERS KNEW HIM FAR BETTER THAN I DID.
where ARE THEY?
what's WRONG?
what DO YOU MEAN, HERE?
their SHIP DOCKED AN HOUR AGO.
they're ON THEIR WAY TO THE PALACE NOW.
and THEY REQUEST AN IMMEDIATE AUDIENCE WITH YOU!
how DELICIOUS. WIFE AND LOVER COME TOGETHER TO SEE YOU.
hush, WOMAN.
what DO THEY WANT? - I DON'T KNOW.
what SHALL I TELL THEM? THEY WILL BE HERE.
just, GIVE-- GIVE
give ME TIME TO THINK.
no.
they WOULD NOT HAVE COME OF THEIR OWN ACCORD.
Octavian MUST HAVE SENT THEM HERE.
sent THEM TO DO WHAT?
Oh, WHY ELSE SEND MY WIFE
except TO EFFECT SOME KIND OF...
reconciliation.
well, YOU MUST REFUSE HER.
obviously, YES.
hmm, BUT THAT
that IS EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS.
he IS FORCING ME TO CHOOSE PUBLICLY
between HER AND-- AND YOU.
and WHEN I TURN HER AWAY, WHICH I WILL, HE WILL HAVE HIS PREMISE FOR WAR.
then WHY SO GLUM?
you HAVE WHAT YOU WANTED. A WAR THAT HE WILL START, A WAR THAT YOU DID NOT SEEK.
still, I...
I DO NOT LIKE IT.
ha, HE IS
he IS STRIKING AT MY SUPPORT AMONGST THE PEOPLE.
he-- HE WILL THINK HE HAS OUTMANEUVERED ME.
what MATTER?
as LONG AS YOU WIN THE WAR.
Yes.
I SUPPOSE SO. - IN ANY CASE...
we MUST BE GRACIOUS HOSTS, NAY? - HM?
we SHALL THROW A LOVELY PARTY FOR THEM.
charmian, SEND FOR THE KITCHEN CHAMBERLAIN.
no NO NO. NO!
no? WE MUST BE HOSPITABLE.
you'd LOVE THAT, WOULDN'T YOU?
humiliating ATIA.
watching HER SQUIRM AS YOU PLAY THE QUEEN.
play THE QUEEN?
I AM A QUEEN.
you KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
no. NO, I DON'T.
you-- YOU JUST WANT TO
flaunt OUR LOVE IN FRONT OF HER.
why NOT?
we LOVE EACH OTHER, DON'T WE?
and YOU NO LONGER LOVE HER.
why SHOULD SHE NOT KNOW IT?
it's AN ACT OF KINDNESS.
stop HER PINING FOR YOU.
I'm NOT WRONG, AM I?
you DO NO LONGER LOVE HER.
of COURSE I NO LONGER LOVE HER.
you KNOW I NO LONGER LOVE HER.
but NEITHER DO I THINK SHE DESERVES PUBLIC HUMILIATION.
that IS THE WHOLE POINT.
that IS WHY THEY'RE HERE, TO BE HUMILIATED.
no, I DON'T THINK SHE KNOWS THAT.
else SHE WOULD NOT BE HERE.
I THINK HER FUCKING SON
has MANIPULATED HER INTO IT.
let's KILL THEM THEN.
what?
what DID YOU SAY?
Atia WILL NOT BE HUMILIAD...
because ATIA WILL BE DEAD.
Octavian WILL KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT A MAN TO BE OUTMANEUVERED.
it's PERFECT.
no. MY PEOPLE WILL DESPISE ME AS A WIFE-KILLER.
well, THEIR SHIP SANK ON THE WAY HOME.
no. - IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
no. I MEAN IT. NO!
I SEE. WELL, I THINK YOU ARE A COWARD!
or YOU STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER.
- WHICH IS IT?
which IS IT?
why DON'T YOU SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH?
gods, WHAT A GHASTLY PLACE.
big, THOUGH.
it's A SURE SIGN OF VULGARITY.
ptolemies WERE ORIGINALLY GOAT-HERDS, YOU KNOW?
why ARE THE DOORS NOT OPEN?
Ah! NO!
this IS OUTRAGEOUS.
the RUDENESS.
it JUST GOES TO SHOW-- VULGAR.
royalty, INDEED.
this HEAT'S UNBEARABLE.
I THINK I'M GOING TO FAINT.
you WOULD THINK THEY WOULD BRING US WATER.
can't WE GO BACK TO THE SHIP? - ABSOLUTELY NOT.
we're STAYING HERE UNTIL THESE WRETCHED PEOPLE...
Oh, ABOUT BLOODY TIME.
hello.
Jocasta. IS IT YOU?
of COURSE IT'S ME. WHO ELSE WOULD I BE?
what's HAPPENED TO YOU?
Oh, THIS?
her MAJESTY DOESN'T LIKE THE ROMAN STYLE ON HER WOMEN.
quite IRRATIONAL ABOUT THE SUBJECT IF YOU ASK ME.
but ANYTHING FOR A QUIET LIFE, EH?
I RATHER LIKE IT NOW.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE? HAVE YOU COME FOR CROCODILE DAY?
that's WHAT I CALL IT ANYWAY. I CAN'T GET MY MOUTH AROUND THEIR LINGO.
she WILL SHRIEK.
but I JUST PRETEND I'M A LITTLE MAD, AND SHE LEAVES OFF.
why IS THE DOOR KEPT SHUT? WHY IS THERE NO ONE HERE TO GREET US?
Oh, I'M SURE THERE'LL BE SOMEONE ALONG IN A WHILE.
things MOVE... EVER SO SLOW AROUND HERE.
it's THE HEAT.
listen, WHY DON'T YOU GO INSIDE
and TELL ANTONY THAT WE'RE WAITING TO SEE HIM?
obviously, HE'S NOT BEEN INFORMED THAT WE'RE HE.
no ONE'S ALLOWED TO SPEAK TO ANTONY WITHOUT SHE SAYS SO.
except MY DEAR LITTLE POSCA.
and LUUS VORENUS, OF COURSE.
I LOVE YOUR HAIR LIKE THAT. IS THAT HOW PEOPLE ARE WEARING IT NOW?
Oh, THANK JUNO. POSCA.
what IN HEAVEN'S NAME IS
Posca: JOCASTA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I WAS ONLY-- - QUIET, WOMAN!
POSCA, WHERE'S ANTONY?
Yes, YES! A GREAT PLEASURE.
INDEEDS. COME ALONG.
POSCA?
POSCA?
thank YOU.
they've ALL GONE INSANE.
it's FOR THE BEST, YOU KNOW.
this PALACE LIFE IS NO GOOD FOR YOU.
you NEED ACTION.
Yeah.
you'll BE MUCH MORE HAPPY WHEN THE WAR BEGINS.
Vorenus. - SIR.
I HAVE A DELICATE MISSION FOR YOU.
Oh, I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU HAVEN'T GONE NATIVE, AT LEAST.
perhaps YOU CAN TALK SOME SENSE.
what IS THE MATTER WITH THESE PEOPLE?
why HASN'T ANTONY BEEN TOLD OF OUR ARRIVAL?
I've BEEN ORDERED BY TRIUMVIR MARK ANTONY
to ESCORT YOU BOTH BACK TO YOUR SHIP, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LEAVE ALEXANDRIA AS SOON AS THE WIND ALLOWS.
without SEEING HIM?
he TURNS AWAY THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILD?
that's CORRECT.
it WAS SHE WHO ORDERED YOU TO DO THIS, WASN'T IT?
Antony WOULDN'T ACT SO LOW.
I TAKE ORDERS ONLY FROM MARK ANTONY, MADAM.
no, WE'RE NOT GOING.
mother, I-- - MADAM?
we ARE NOT GOING.
I AM NOT MOVING FROM THIS SPOT
unless ANTONY COMES DOWN HIMSELF AND TELLS ME TO GO.
if YOU WILL NOT GO WLINGLY, I HAVE BEEN GIVEN ORDERS TO USE WHATEVER FORCE NECESSARY TO REMOVE YOU.
you WOULD MANHANDLE THE WOMEN OF THE JULII?
no, BUT THESE MEN HERE...
they HAVE NO SUCH SCRUPLES.
Antony! - MADAM.
come DOWN, YOU BASTARD!
madam, PLEASE!
you TELL MY HUSBAND THAT HE'S COWARDLY SCUM.
tell HIM THAT.
you REALIZE, OF COURSE, WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE ALL OUR MONEY BEHIND.
I DON'T CARE! - WE'RE PENNILESS.
I'm SCARED. I WANT TO GO HOME.
please, HURRY.
going SOMEWHERE? - NO.
no, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?
please, VORENUS.
don't TELL. PLEASE DON'T TELL.
have MERCY ON US.
they'll KILL US.
they'll THROW US TO THE CROCODILES.
my WIFE IS OVERWROUGHT.
we WERE MERELY GOING TO TAKE A STROLL ALONG THE HARBOR TO LOOK AT THE SHIPS.
then YOU MUST HURRY.
the WIND IS CHANGING. THE SHIPS LOOK BEST WHEN THE SAILS ARE SET.
come WITH US.
no.
war IS SURE TO COME NOW.
this IS NO PLACE FOR DECENT ROMANS.
true, BUT I HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES HERE.
now IS THE TIME.
if YOU HAPPEN TO SEE TITUS PULLO,
ask HIM TO KISS MY CHILDREN FOR ME.
I WILL DO THAT.
thank YOU.
Hello, AGAIN.
Posca: SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU.
would YOU MIND AWFULLY IF WE HIDE HERE
until THIS BOAT IS AT SEA?
I've TOLD YOU EVERYTHING I REMEMBER.
there MUST BE MORE THAN THAT.
look TO YOURSELF.
you ARE WHAT REMAINS OF HIM.
Vorenus.
well?
they're GONE.
good.
good.
and HOW IS... ATIA?
I SUPPOSE SHE TOOK IT WITH HER USUAL POISE?
no.
no?
had TO BE DONE.
Where's POSCA?
I SENT FOR HIM BUT HE DID NOT COME.
I DON'T KNOW, SIR. DO YOU WISH ME TO GO AND LOOK FOR HIM?
Oh, NO NO.
it's ALL RIGHT.
I'm SURE HE'LL TURN UP.
sir, YOUR WIFE INSTRUCTED ME TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
she INSTRUCTED ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE COWARDLY SCUM.
she DID, DID SHE?
Oh. AND
and WHAT'S YOUR OPINION OF THAT?
it's NOT MY PLACE TO HAVE AN OPINION, SIR.
Nah. TELL ME ANYWAY.
is THAT AN ORDER?
Yes. THAT AN ORDER.
you're NO COWARD.
but YOU DO HAVE A STRONG DISEASE IN YOUR SOUL.
a DISEASE THAT WILL EAT AWAY AT YOU...
until YOU DIE.
Really?
and WHAT IS THIS DISEASE?
I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT A DOCTOR.
no.
no, YOU'RE NOT.
so HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE OF YOUR DIAGNOSIS, THEN?
I RECOGNIZE YOUR SYMPTOMS.
I HAVE THE SAME SICKNESS.
long ONE.
Hello, MOTHER. AND POSCA.
what A PLEASANT SURPRISE.
I GATHER ANTONY WAS NOT AMENABLE TO PERSUASION.
no, HE WAS NOT.
but YOU KNEW THAT, DIDN'T YOU?
you WANTED A VILLA IN CAPRI.
now YOU MAY HAVE ONE.
is OCTAVIA WELL?
Posca HAS SOMETHING HERE THAT WILL HELP YOU DESTROY ANTONY.
mother, I AM HOPING-- - CRUSH ANTONY AND HIS QUEEN.
and YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DAMN VILLA.
you HAVE SOMETHING FOR ME, POSCA?
it IS THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT
of ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA.
to BE OPENED AND READ ONLY ON THE OCCASION OF THEIR DEATH.
it IS A DESPICABLE DOCUMENT.
taken TOGETHER WITH HIS REPUDIATION OF YOUR SISTER, THE ROMAN PEOPLE WOULD THINK A WAR AGAINST ANTONY
not ONLY INEVITABLE
but EMINENTLY DESIRABLE.
is IT GENUINE? - IT IS GENUINE.
you ARE A GOOD AND LOYAL FRIEND, POSCA.
this ONE HAS COOKED HIMSELF FOR DINNER.
he ASKS TO BE BURIED IN ALEXANDRIA.
he DECLARES CLEOPATRA HIS WIFE AND THAT THEY ARE LIVING GS.
she IS ISIS AND HE, OSIRIS.
it's PERFECT. - WAIT, WAIT. IT'S BETTER.
he LEAVES TO HIS CHILDREN BY CLEOPATRA ALL THE EASTERN PROVINCES.
and HER SON BY CAESAR
is TO BE GIVEN ROME AND THE WEST.
having REJECTED HIS LOVING WIFE, OCTAVIA, MARK ANTONY HAS COUPLED HIMSELF TO THE SORCERESS
Cleopatra, PROMISING HER DOMINION OF ALL ROME!
he WORSHIPS DOGS AND REPTILES.
he BLACKENS HIS EYES WITH SOOT LIKE A PROSTITUTE.
he DANCES AND PLAYS THE CYMBALS IN VILE NILOTIC RITES.
I KNOW HOW UNHAPPY YOU ARE AND I CANNOT BLAME YOU.
for WHO WOULD NOT WEEP WHEN HE HEARS THAT THE GREAT MARK ANTONY PAYS HOMAGE TO FOREIGN GODS?
that HE HAS ABANDONED HIS WIFE,
his CHILD AND HIS COUNTRY?
I AM ASKED IF HE IS GONE MAD, IF HE IS BEWITCHED.
I HAVE NO EXPLANATION.
we MAY WEEP FOR HIM, BUT THEN WE MUST DO OUR DUTY, FOR HE IS NO LONGER A ROMAN, BUT AN EGYPTIAN.
and WHAT IS LEFT FOR US TO DO BUT FIGHT HIM?
fight HIM AND DESTROY HIM!
Pullo.
my OLD FRIEND, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
sir.
come, SIT DOWN.
Posca TELLS ME OUR FRIEND VORENUS
stands BY ANTONY EVEN NOW.
loyal MAN, VORENUS.
he SENDS YOU HIS BEST REGARDS, ASKED THAT YOUISS HIS CHILDREN FOR HIM.
he's ALL RIGHT, IS HE? - YOU KNOW HIM.
iron AS EVER.
- YOU AND HE ARE STILL FRIENDS, THEN?
Yes.
very SOON I WILL HAVE TO GO EAST TO END THIS THING WITH ANTONY.
I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME.
Why? - YOU ARE CLOSE TO VORENUS.
he IS CLOSE TO ANTONY. IT MAY BE YOU CAN ACT AS A MEDIATOR.
and MAYBE WE CAN SAVE UNNECESSARY BLOODSHED.
not TO ARGUE WITH YOU, BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY.
there ARE SOME WILL HAVE TO DIE, OF COURSE. ANTONY CANNOT BE SAVED.
the BOY CAESARIO WILL HAVE TO GO, OBVIOUSLY. - CAESARION?
they HAVE NAMED HIM PUTATIVE KING OF ROME, PULLO.
he WILL HAVE TO DIE. BUT PERHAPS CLEOPATRA AND HER CHILDREN BY ANTONY MAY BE SAVED.
preserve SOME STABILITY. - YES.
I SEE.
I DO NOT WANT TO ORDER YOU TO CO, PULLO, BUT I WILL IF I HAVE TO.
no.
no PROBLEM.
I'll COME.
good.
it WILL BE LIKE OLD TIMES.
an ADVENTURE TOGETHER.
so, ANTONY MORE OR LESS FORCED OCTAVIAN INTO WAR.
else THE EAST WOULD BE LOST TO THE GYPOS.
we WOULDN'T WANT THAT, NOW WOULD WE?
worshipping A BUNCH OF DOGS AND CATS AND WHAT HAVE YOU.
ANYROAD, THE THING IS, OCTAVIAN'S ORDERED ME TO GO ALONG WITH HIM.
so THAT'S WHAT I'LL BE DOING-- GOING ALONG WITH HIM.
can I COME WITH YOU? - NO. SORRY.
you STAY HERE WITH ME, HMM? WE'LL BE FINE.
you'll HARDLY NOTICE I'M GONE.
and THE GOOD NEWS IS, I'M MORE THAN LIKELY TO SEE YOUR FATHER.
he SENT WORD THAT I SHOULD GIVE YOU ALL A KISS FROM HIM.
if I SEE HIM, CAN I GIVE HIM A KISS FROM YOU IN RETURN?
no. HE KILLED OUR MOTHER.
it's TRUE, ISN'T IT?
you're A HARD ONE, YOU.
my FATHER MADE ME SO.
I HEAR YOU.
while I'M AWAY, THERE'LL BE NO TROUBLE BETWEEN YOU.
no SKIMMING FROM THE GRAIN RATION, NO STEALING OF WOMEN, NOR ANY EXTORTION, ROBBERY, OR ARSON
unless UNDER DIRECT LICENSE BY MASCIUS.
anybody STEPS OUT OF LINE, THEY'LL BE SHARING THEIR DINNER WITH MEMMIO.
don't FORGET YOUR VINEGAR FLASK.
mm, RIGHT.
give US A SMILE, EH? WON'T BE GONE FOREVER.
if YOU REALLY LOVED ME, YOU'D TAKE ME WITH YOU.
it's A WAR, NOT A SHOPPING TRIP.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.
I KNOW YOU CAN. WHICH IS WHY I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT LEAVING YOU HERE.
where ARE YOU GOING NOW?
vinegar.
memmio?
this IS NOT HAPPENING. THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
what HAVE I DONE?
why ARE YOU PUNISHING ME LIKE THIS?
Oh, YOU SELFISH BASTARD. IT'S ME WHO'S DYING, NOT YOU WHO'S BEING PUNISHED.
it's ME.
I'm GONNA DIE.
it IS AS-- AS IT SHOULD BE.
what HAVE YOU EVER DONE?
you're A GOOD WOMAN.
Oh, DON'T GET SENTIMENTAL ON ME NOW.
one THING I'M NOT IS A GOOD WOMAN.
you've BEEN GOOD TO ME.
no, I HAVEN'T.
EIRENE WAS A GOOD WOMAN.
not A SHE-WOLF LIKE ME.
she HAD HER MOMENTS.
she WAS GONNA GIVE YOU A CHILD.
fate HAD A DIFFERENT PLAN.
we're HAPPY ENOUGH, YOU AND ME.
I'm SORRY.
I CAN'T GO TO THE AFTERLIFE WITH LIES IN MY HEART.
nemesis WON'T LET ME REST.
what LIES?
what's NEMESIS WANT WITH YOU?
send THESE PEOPLE AWAY.
get OUT.
remember WHEN I'M GONE, WHAT I DID,
I DID OUT OF LOVE FOR YOU.
did WHAT?
it WAS ME...
who KILLED EIRENE AND YOUR CHILD.
I WANTED YOU FOR MYSELF.
so I POISONED HER.
goodbye, LOVE.

God who sees all

hatred, hatred
I see it burning in your eyes

hatred, hatred
it's the courage the cowards lack
hatred, hatred
the sister of love but one who hides
I curse you for all those nights
to you to act without you understanding
you forget the even the happiness
the only one that counts, is the hate you look at her and are seduced
this whore of hatred who takes all of you
you look and you are nothing
only puppets in her hands
how can we make in her name
all this crimes and victims
the hatred, it comes to lie in your souls
then listen to the voice of the women
the hatred
the hatred
the hatred<One Day>
I am loved by women, I who am not yet 20 years old
I know all their traps, they hurt me so often
I am loved by women, without loving them
I made them cry, when they saw me tired
of their white skin, tired of pretending to love them
I did not truly love them
love, I want it now
what can one know of love when one is only 16 years old?
of course one knows that someday but, that one day will be when?
what can one know of life, when yours hasn't begun?
and one dies of impatience waiting for him
who you will love, that, who will always say to you
the words, these words that one waits for
love, I want it now
one day she will come
one day she will be my love
one day, he will come, that day
where I will live love, one day
one day, one will forget these days, to trail the heavy heart
one day it will be our turn to love one day
one day, the same vow will be made
I was alone, one will be two, and will love so strong
in our souls, in our bodies
and when death comes, one will still love each other, one day
one day, the same vow will be made
I was alone, one will be two, and will love so strong
in our souls, in our bodies
and when death comes, one will still love each other
one day
one day...
one day...
<The Request of Marriage>
I am 30 years old, I am charming
I love your child, give her to me
I am a good person
I have princes and kings behind me
I will pay your debts, if you have any
I will throw parties, to honour you
but on my knee I implore you
give me Juliette, because I adore her
dear friend, I am surprised
that your love is that much
heavy error to take a heart Before its time
I frighten you but she is so tender
it must wait
come, though, tonight, you can see her
but for pity, at least have
a little patience, beginning with a dance
but me, I think, but when I think of it
heavy error, to take a heart, before its time
before its time<You Must Marry>
your father no longer loves me He only loved me
when he knew He wanted to marry
love came to him When he desired me
when he saw me naked Don't look shocked
I was beautiful like the rest I was beautiful like you
he had soft eyes And he looked at only me
and then time passed And our love is gone
we all have the same dream
to love until the fever
Juliette you are old enough
to think of marriage
now listen to your mother
now listen to your nurse
men!
men! Men are so fragile
they don't know who we are That's to say it's not easy
I hate men
me, I adore them
they do nothing to you
I know, but I still hope
Juliette listen to your mother Of course, that's right
if she took lovers She had her reasons
don't believe that jealousy I was a good wife
you father is my only man He knows who I am
life is too short Life is too beautiful
for you to travel your road Without passing by the church
your dress is already ready
I know, it's me who made it
we are weak women
in a vale of tears
you will avenge us
you must marry
now I beg you
I beg you also
life is too short Life is too beautiful
for you to travel your road Without passing by the church
one day you will thank us You must take a husband<The Kings of the World>
the kings of the world live to the summit
they have the most beautiful view but there is a but
they don't know what we think of them down here
they don't know that here it's us who are kings
the kings of the world do all that they want to
they have the world around them but they are alone
in their castles on high, they are bored
while down here we dance all the night
we make love we live life Day after day, night after night
what is the point of being alive If we have to live on our knees
we know that time is like the wind Living is important
we have no morals We know we do nothing wrong
the kings of the world fear everything
they confuse the dogs and the wolves
they make traps where they will fall one day
they protect themselves from everything, even from love
the kings of the world fight with each other
there is not room for two of them
and us down here don't fight their wars
we don't even know why all these games of kings are necessary
we make love we live life Day after day, night after night
what is the point of being alive If we have to live on our knees
we know that time is like the wind Living is important
we have no morals We know we do nothing wrong
we make love we live life Day after day, night after night
what is the point of being alive If we have to live on our knees [What is the point of being alive] We know that time is like the wind Living is important
we have no morals We know we do nothing wrong [We have no morals] We make love we live life Day after day, night after night [We know we do nothing wrong] What is the point of being alive If we have to live on our knees [We know that time is like the wind] We know that time is like the wind Living is important [We have no morals] We have no morals We know we do nothing wrong
we make love we live life Day after day, night after night
what is the point of being alive If we have to live on our knees
we know that time is like the wind Living is important
we have no morals We know we do nothing wrong<I'm Afraid>
you, my friends, my blood brothers
you who I've loved for so long a time
like me, on your shoulders
do you feel death pass by you
you who laugh at everything, at nothing
who mock tomorrow
me, Romeo who saw upclose
this night, my friends, I admit to you
I'm afraid, I'm afraid
that our shadows so light
tomorrow change into stone
that the stars which guides us
one day leads us to the void
I'm afraid...
that tomorrow everything stops That trouble settles into our heads
that winds of chance will be caught in our guitars
you my friends, my brothers of taste
you who want to taste all
the fruits of the heart are most tender
but they die when December comes
you who are young
have all the courage and boredom
then listen to one of your age
who this evening sees the coming shipwreck
I'm afraid, I'm afraid
of the life that awaits us
the lies of our parents
for us all is easy but happiness is fragile
I'm afraid...
that the gods in their anger
will taken vengeance on us, my brothers
for loving life so much but never saying thank you
I'm afraid, I'm afraid
of the life that awaits us
the lies of our parents
I'm afraid, oh so afraid
that the stars who guide us
one day will push us to the void
I'm afraid...
<Happy Love>
she wears a light dress
a little silk for which
she is beautiful, beautiful to die for
beautiful to choose One day to die for her
those are the eyes of men
when he looks at me with them
and he burns
like an angel of hell
like an angel on earth
like an angel of light
he burns
will you love me one day?
until the end of the last day?
will you love me still
until the end, until death?
will you love me one day, my love?
will you love me one day, my love?
will you love me still?
until the end, until death?
it's what people say who love
it's what one wants, happy love
will you love me one day?
until the end of the last day?
will you love me still
until the end, until death?
will you love me one day, my love?
will you love me one day, my love?
will you love me still?
until the end, until death?
it's what people say who love
it's what one wants, happy love<It's Not My Fault>
the memories one invents are more beautiful
childhood is more troubling when all is false
mine was stolen, I was betrayed
I am the son of hatred and contempt
blinders were put on me and they said to me
the others, they will want war you want it also
and I grew up in the shadows of sentiments
too much black, to many shadows, for a child
alone, I am all alone
alone, always alone
it's not my fault
it's not my fault
if my parents have made me
I am what you see
it's not my fault
it's not my fault
I am the arms of their vengeance
and I must obey them
it's not my fault
don't look at me like that
it's not my fault
I have not had, no, not the choice
I am the son of their violence
proud of their birth
it's not my fault, oh
no, no, no
it's not my fault
don't look at me like that
it's not my fault
I have not had, no, not the choice
I am the son of their violence
proud of their birth
the memories one invents are more beautiful
childhood is more troubling when all is false
mine was stolen, I was betrayed
I am the son of hatred and contempt<The Poet>
of course I am wrong said the earth
until I no longer turn round
I believed myself so strong
now, I touch the bottom
and I turn in the universe
like the snow on the wind
and I wait
I wait until men break my heart
until their madness explodes
they make a great mistake
the last overdose
but me I turn in the universe
like the snow on the wind
and waiting...
you who can make the earth speak
you who know so well of the words
tell me poet what is the purpose of
one more day without Romeo
me, I am a fool of the universe
for tonight, I love a man
to speak of the world and her mysteries
to speak of all it is to speak too much
tell me poet what is the purpose of
one more day without Romeo
me, I am a fool of the evils of the world
for tonight, I love a man
for tonight, I love a man
and that God pardon me if I betray my father
and that God abandons me, I have no fear of his anger
for tonight, I love a man
now you see, poet
in the world tonight I am a fool
for tonight, I love a man<The Balcony>
to which star, to which God
do I owe this love in his eyes?
who wanted up there
that Juliette loves Romeo?
to which star, to which God
do I owe this love in his eyes?
even if I must pay the price Of a forbidden love
why our father hate each other
and that the daughter loves the son?
they must laugh well, up there
that Juliette loves Romeo
to which star, to which God
do I owe the love in her eyes?
that their will is made
for Romeo loves Juliette
if I must pray, I will pray
if I must fight them, I will fight
but why must we pay
the right of us to love?
and that our fathers tear each other
their children desire each other
one can not change history
ours will begin tonight
and so much worse if it disturbs
that a virgin loves an angel
to which star, to which God
do I owe the love in her/his eyes?
that their will is made
for Romeo loves Juliette
to which star, to which God
do I owe this love in her/his eyes?
they must laugh well, up there
that Juliette loves Romeo<For Love>
for love on becomes crazy
but without it one is nothing at all
me, I am for God
I live only in his eyes
for love one fears to suffer
I am ready to die for it
one loses themselves, one drowns
one hopes and one believes
for love I will make for her
of our lives a rainbow, help us
far from the noise of armies
make us husband and wife, for love
for love, one has too much badness
yes but it's the only star
in the night who guides us
without love our lives are empty
without love
it's God that you love
yes but for me it's Juliette
if everyone must pay, tell me what is my debt?
my father, I beg you
my father, I implore you
marry us today
the injustice is wrong
you will see us forced on our knees in front of you
you will see us like the only ewes in the middle of a pack of wolves
I want so much tonight to sleep with Juliette
to wait in the dark for the soft song of the meadowlark
help us
for love, one can gain
for always eternity, for love
and if God helps us
and that God helps us, for love
for love...
<The Beautiful, The Ugly>
ha, ha, ha laugh the people around
ha, ha, ha they laugh at a love
they don't understand what they don't feel
then it is for that they make ha, ha, ha
laugh, laugh hard you, you would pour tears they would still laugh
God it's easy for the idiots
to be blind and deaf of a grand love
to be blind and deaf
ha, ha, ha, my God she is funny
with this hair here, she has the air of a willow
how Romeo the most beautiful of us
could keep all these oaths
like us all, he lies
the beautiful, the ugly both have the same secrets
life doesn't make us gifts
whether we are ugly or we are beautiful
we all want what we don't have
we are caught for what we aren't
we laugh when love frightens us
but we pray that it will come into our hearts
ha, ha, ha you are only dogs
ha, ha, ha nothing satisfies you
and the jealousies are your only friend
even the north wind must blow weaker
than you silly things
ha, ha, ha, no matter what these two here like
ha, ha, ha, we don't speak the same
two spoiled children can't love
love it is for those who forget the gods
who deserve it
the beautiful, the ugly both have the same secrets
life doesn't make us gifts
whether we are ugly or we are beautiful
we all want what we don't have
we are caught for what we aren't
we laugh when love frightens us
but we pray that it will come into our hearts
the beautiful, the ugly...
Yes, but at the bottom we know well who we are
the beautiful, the ugly...
the beautiful, the ugly both have the same secrets
life doesn't make us gifts
whether we are ugly or we are beautiful
we all want what we don't have
we are caught for what we aren't
we laugh when love frightens us
but we pray that it will come into our hearts
we all want what we don't have
we are caught for what we aren't
we laugh when love frightens us
but we pray that it will come into our hearts
the beautiful, the ugly...
<And Now She Loves>
me, I'm nobody, nobody is around me
one tells me you give your milk and your love
and when I saw her eyes I thanked the gods
and I prayed to heaven that her life would be beautiful
and Juliette grew
and now she loves, and now she dances
she tells me, 'I love him', she leaves childhood
and me who is nothing but her nurse, her cousin
it's not me who she looks like
but I am the only one for her when she is scared
and now she loves and now she dances
and now she loves
and me who doesn't have her, I leave her with another
when she says 'my daughter', me, I think it's ours
why to please their husbands
so many women like her forget
that they made children and will be twenty years old
and Juliette grew
and now she loves, and now she dances
she tells me, 'I love him', she leaves childhood
and me who is here, who looks and who sees
I would give my life all the same
for this child who grows
and now she loves and now she dares
that her heart explodes and now she loves
and you who know that love can kill
give me the strength, the courage
to lead her to marriage
and now she loves
and now she dances
and now she loves
and now she loves<To Love>
to love is the most beautiful thing
to love is to go up so high
and touch the wings of birds
to love is the most beautiful thing
to love is to steal time
to love is to remain living
and to burn to the heart of a volcano
to love is the grandest thing
to love is stronger than all
to give the best of us
to love and to feel one's heart
to love to have no fear
to love is the most beautiful thing
to love is to go up so high
and touch the wings of birds
to love is the most beautiful thing
to love is to steal time
to love is to remain living
and to burn to the heart of a volcano
to love is the grandest thing
to love is to burn in the nights
to love is to pay the price
and to give a direction to one's life
to love is to burn in the nights
to love is the most beautiful thing
to love is to go up so high
and touch the wings of birds
to love is the most beautiful thing
to love...
<They Say in the Street>
they say in the street, that Romeo is lost
that he deserves the blade of the people who sell their hearts
they say in the street, that the son of Montaigu
betrayed his parents, dishonoured his class
but you who lives like an angel, nothing disturbs you
you believe all is right, but life one day will avenge herself [You had no right] Don't talk to me of right [You had no right] You have nothing on me [You had no right] I believe that you will never love [You had no right] From you, I keep no secrets [You had no right] I look at you and I'm ashamed [You had no right] I'm sick of what they tell [You had no right] The only thing for me that counts [You had no right] Is that you love her too
they say in the street that by taking her virtue
you have lost yours and awakened the hate
they say in the street that for you have no way out
that to save your honour, you must leave this flower
but you who lives like an angel, nothing disturbs you
you believe all is right, but life one day will avenge herself [You had no right] What do you want me to say to you?
[You had no right] To punish me for my frankness?
[You had no right] You know everything about me [You had no right] You doubt so, why?
[You had no right] Why judge me so?
[You had no right] You my brothers, you my friends [You had no right] I am free as you were [You had no right] Before you wanted to judge me
of course it's life that chooses
of course it's life that chooses
but why the daughter of your enemy?
I can do nothing, it was written
when all the women want you in their beds
no, no, oh no!
why is it her you have to choose?
I live my life just as I am, I say it to you, oh yes [You had no right] Go, look at you [You had no right] You are simply jealous [You had no right] You forget all those nights [You had no right] With those girls who bore us [You had no right] You forget the vows [You had no right] Which bound us since childhood [You had no right] When one prays in silence [You had no right] For the chance to finally come [You had no right] No, I have betrayed no one [You had no right] I don't want anyone's pardon [You had no right] With you I was someone [You had no right] But without her, I am nothing
no, I have betrayed no one
I do not want anyone's pardon
without her, without her, I am nothing
I am nothing
you had no right...
<It's the Day>
women are only lessons
I took my first near my father at 15 years old
all the desires, all the pleasures, I know them so well
I am an excellent lover
the blondes, the brunettes, all except one
the only one who counts
cousin, cousin the joke is fine
I saw her growing, I saw her leaving with him
how can she love the son of Montague?
it's the marriage missed by vice and virtue
it's the day, It's the day
it's the day, It's the day
today I am writing a letter
dear friend, yes, I will kill you
I will kill him, not wound
like she wounded me
Juliette, I go to make him pay for your weakness
women are only prisons
I was locked in the heart of Juliette at 15 years old
I never dared, I will never dare
to tell her that she is loved by Tybalt in secret but
it's the day, It's the day
it's the day, It's the day
the day the men fight
the day the storm bursts
I will kill him, not wound
like she wounded me
Romeo, I will make you pay for her weakness [It's the day] My heart betrays me [It's the day] Even if I fear the night [It's the day] To die of jealousy [It's the day] It's to die of love also
don't talk to me of honour
it's for love that men die
I will find you Romeo, I will kill you Romeo
and you will know that all men have the heart torn<The Duel>
Tybalt, Tybalt, you are dead
Tybalt, Tybalt, finish laughing
you are not only one conceited person, no, you are worse
your soul limps but you believe to run
the way you speak, the way you walk
all, all of you nauseates me
Tybalt, Tybalt, I will kill you
Mercutio, look at you
you have spirit but you have only that
you are only a buffoon, a failed poet
and when I hear your name
I hold my nose. Now it's finished
I have this thought since I was young
finally my patience will be rewarded
Mercutio, I will kill you
stop, you are fools, you don't have the right
in your killing, you kill our ideas and our laws
stop!
live, we want all to live
without hating each other, without dying from it
to live and to talk, to respect, and even like each other
free we are all free to follow, to refuse
for those who you love, your mothers, your wives
forget the hatred, put down your weapons
to live and to drink to chance
drunk, but not on vengeance
live, we want all to live
without hating each other, without dying from it
to live and to talk, to respect, and even like each other
stop, you are fools, you don't have the right, no
death waits its hour, await yours
don't make the error, don't make the fault
to live to understand each other, to live and grow old together
he hates me so much, since so long ago, no, Romeo
his grace is too much, it's like a dog in rage
a coward who believes in his courage
what do you believe, you are not king, no
you are like us, even worse than us
you're now full of love and you piss kindness
you are like the vultures who await weakness
live, Live it's to fight each other, life isn't a theater
live, Freedom...
live, we want all to live
without hating each other, without dying from it
to live and to talk, to respect, and even like each other
live...
<Death of Mercutio>
Romeo
Mercutio, you're hurt
no, what can still hurt Mercutio, no?
but life, Romeo, look, she escapes, she leaves us
but you bleed!
no, I leave
you were always so clumsy Romeo
why did you come between us? I received the blow under your arm
don't be sorry, it's for children to be sorry and Juliette loves a man, no?
don't cry, love her, Romeo
Mercutio!
love her with all your soul, with all your strength
she will give you what no woman has ever given me
love her Romeo, love her
I die, in the dust but I die, in your arms
Romeo, oh my brother, what will you do without me?
I die for you to live, but you will not live
I pass on the other bank, I will wait for you over there
continue your war, but continue without me
I die in the dust, but I die like a king
I curse your families, I curse your houses
Romeo, so fragile, you will lose reason
Mercutio...Don't leave me!
I beg you Mercutio, don't leave me!
Mercutio!
who will know one day, how much love you had
God life on earth, is only one hell
Oh, oh...
Tybalt, Tybalt!
God, life on earth is only one hell
adieu my friend, adieu<The Vengeance>
what is the price?
who will pay for his life?
what is the fate?
that one gives to those who give death?
my son is killed
but you all here you know
that Tybalt before
has already made blood run
the affair is done
but now for it all to stop
I must believe you
I must know
I didn't, I swear it to you Want what happened
vengeance is not my nature
nevertheless, I avenged him
it's therefore necessary, to do something
when one sees dying, a brother
you, who you hate so much
how can you, judge us
we are all three, your children
it's you alone, who have killed them
we are only mimes
we imitate, your crimes
Oh!
what is the price?
who will pay for his life?
what is the fate?
that one gives to those who give death?
what is the price?
who will pay for his life?
what is the fate?
that one gives to those who give death?
the affair is done
but now for it all to stop
I must believe you
I must know
Oh, what is the price<Power>
to be prince, to be king
to have all powers but no rights
to be prince over here
to live under the laws
they envy me but for what?
they say 'him' while speaking of me
they fear me, They believe me
for they are hot, I'm cold
and yet I acknowledge it
I sacrifice all
for to keep on you
the power, the power, the power
some are rich, some are beautiful
the mind never rests
that gods were very received
some are certain to be happy
some are evil in hell
the wind who blows on the seas
I don't know
the lightest pain
what biggest pleasure to have
between their hands the power
it's better than gold, than ivory
when the world is their mirror
the power, the power
the power, one savours it
it's stronger than love
softer than velvet
women who try to court me
the power, it's enjoyable
and I enjoy their confidence
and when I give my seed
it's to history that I think
the power, it's fantastic
I am a man but public
in this world where all is bought
I am the only who can borrow
in this world where all is sold
they give me all, if not I take it
of dwarves, I am the giant
and I lie, I lie, I lie
the power, ah! my friends
if you only knew the price
it's death who smiles at you
eternity in one life
and when I make justice
virtue versus vice
it's the father who speaks to the son
I command, they obey
the power, that merits
one takes it, or one inherits it
and the day where one leaves it
then one constructs their myth
the power that burns in you
the power that makes you crazy
the power, one is nailed there
and when it abandons you
one dies
the power...
<Duet of Despair>
the things are never, how one would like them to be
Juliette now you know, what I already knew
and you cry, you cry, my daughter, my sister
I feel your pain
God, men, are hard
men, are sure them
Oh! God, men, are hard
what do we have to do
for you to grant your grace?
God, you who put us on earth
why force us to conceal us?
and watch the death of men
the prince, by chasing you out
saved you, you know
they claimed your blood
the blood of Montague
and you poor, little, lost thing
you, you don't understand anymore
God, men, are hard
men, are sure them
Oh! God, men, are hard
what do we have to do
for you to grant your grace?
God, you who put us on earth
why force us to conceal us?
and watch the death of men
God, men, are hard
men, are sure them
Oh! God, men, are hard
what do we have to do
for you to grant your grace?
God, you who put us on earth
why force us to conceal us?
and watch the death of men
God, men, are hard
men, are sure them
Oh! God, men, are hard
what do we have to do
for you to grant your grace?
God, you who put us on earth
why force us to conceal us?
and watch the death of men
God...
<The Lark's Song>
Juliette, Juliette
I hear the lark's song
I will be strong but be ready
Juliette, I must go
Romeo, Romeo
no, it's that of the nightingale
I feel that I will go mad
Romeo, if you leave
I don't want to
I can't
live without you
to love you, To love you until the end of the night
to sleep in your arms
to die with you
to love you, To love you
all a life to love you
only human justice is not certain
they've never loved to be able to judge us
to love you, tomorrow, you will be so far
to love you, To love you until the end of the night
to sleep in your arms, to die with you
to sleep in your arms, to die with you
to love you<Tomorrow>
Paris, It's decided you will have my daughter
Paris, I give to you my rose, my daffodil
I do it, for her well, that she forgets, her sorrow
and her heart, of satin, now belongs to you
tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, I will give you her hand
Juliette, you know the love your father has for you
Juliette, but tomorrow your childhood will be dead
he gives your hand to Paris, you will give the world a son
may God bless you, He gives you to Paris
tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, he will have, your hand
women have no choice
men have all the rights
but why you cry, unless you know
what is coming hour of your bliss
tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, he will have your hand
nurse, my father wants me to marry Paris [Tomorrow...he will have your hand]
nurse, why must I obey? [Tomorrow...you can do nothing]
I prefer to kill myself [How can you dare?]
to be obligated to love, this Paris so well born
I am already married
tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, he will have your hand
Juliette how can you still
love when your cousin is dead
I beg it of you, you must say yes To this husband, you've been promised
tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, he will have your hand
tomorrow, he will have your hand
tomorrow, he will have your hand
I don't want, let me go
you renounce it, out of pity
it's your father you must do as he tells you
No!
tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, he will have your hand<To have a girl>
to have a girl A little opal
with eyes that shine Skin so pale
to have a girl
it's to make a woman
a little virtuoso Before her scale
to have a girl
a heart of sand
gift of God
gift of the devil
to have a girl It's to commit a crime
where the guilty is the victim
to have a girl
she is my life, she is my blood
she is the fruit of my 20 years
and I curse all her lovers
she is my life, she is my blood
and I curse all her lovers
to have a girl, it's to tremble with fear
that she made up for a liar
to have a girl, it forbids me To treat the women like I did her
to have a girl
I hate the men and their looks
I know their ruses and their victories
and when comes the day when one of them
will take my girl while calling me 'Sir'
then that day and forever
I will close with double locks
my heart and I will become deaf
to have a girl it's to continue to hope
and believe still that when comes the day of my death
she will bear all at the bottom of her heart
this spark of this or that which in it's turn
and for love comes to cry the heart so heavy
to have a girl A little opal
of eyes shining Skin so pale
to have a girl It's to make a crime
where the guilty is the victim
to have a girl
to have a girl...
<Without Her>
of shade, she, has no need
near her, all is garden
the blue of her sky
it's not make up
the glow of her neck
doesn't need jewels
when with her
it's like in church
that person doesn't call
I will not answer
when I am in her arms
I forget that you are here
for her, I have left all
for her, oh, I have even killed
I am in a cage
as a bird too wise
now, I'm angry
one has banished me, damaged me
and tonight I cry
love is not a crime
it's you the mean
who believe us the victims
open your eyes, open your heart
to love them it's to steal misfortune
and I trail in the streets of Mantua
and I feel that I am becoming, crazy, without her
of shade, she, has no need
near her, all is garden
the blue of her sky
it's not make up
the glow of her neck
nothing must with jewels
when I am with her
it's like in church
that person doesn't call
I will not answer
when I am in her arms
I forget that you are here
Oh...
<The Poison>
where go the Where go the dreams of lovers
their words, their fever
I return, I await you
please God guide us
I kill myself
Romeo why must it be
that one makes Our story
a comedy, a farce
please God guide us
I kill myself
Romeo it necessary for us to play this game
for not to die
I must die a little
this poison here saves us
I will return at dawn
where go the Where go the dreams of lovers
their words, their fever
I return, I await you
please God guide them<How To Tell Him?>
me, who has no importance
who is only his childhood friend
who only loves women and dancing
it's over...
we were yesterday still
so far, so far from death
she is fallen on the village
like a spider weaving it's thread
we were the kings of the world
yes but our wounds are too deep
and even if tomorrow time stops
that will not revive Juliette
and it's me...
who has to tell him that
how to tell him? How to tell him?
that the worst has arrived
how to tell him?
that the women he loves has killed herself
that the bliss is passed
that his childhood is over
that he only has one friend remaining
how to tell him, that he'll suffer?
how to tell him?
me who has always lived
without my parents on the street
when one loses a friend
one becomes, orphaned
when Mercutio sang to us that life is beautiful
me I believed it
Mercutio will sing no more
and me now all alone, lost
we were the kings of the world
yes but our wounds are too deep
and even if tomorrow some regret
that will not revive Juliette
and it's me...
who has to tell him
how to tell him? How to tell him?
that the worst has arrived, how to tell him?
that the women he loves is dead
and in leaving she carries
half of his love
she takes all of always
how to tell him that he'll suffer
how to tell him?
how to tell him? How to tell him?
that the worst has arrived, how to tell him?
that the women he loves is dead
that the bliss is passed
that his childhood is over
that only one friend remains
how to tell him, that he'll suffer?
how to tell him...
how to tell him...
<Romeo's Death>
what have you done to her, to make her go away?
what have you done to her, which battle
did you win, to separate us?
what have you done to her, that she chooses to die far from me
without me being able to hold her in my arms?
what have you done to make her leave me
the weight of your regrets, my sadness?
it's over, I leave
I wanted to know life, now I know
I am so tired
I don't want any more than to
simply to lie myself down and to take her hand
to hold her in my heart, to forget my pain
it's over, I leave
I wanted to know life, now I know
the honey of her kisses
the kindness in her eyes
I will carry them
and give them to God
adieu my Juliette
it's eternity which awaits us
it's over, I leave
finally to lapse my memory to find peace
I am so tired
I don't want to know any more
simply to lie myself down
to transverse the mirror
to find my Juliette for eternity
she awaits us...
<Juliette's Death>
why should I stay and grow old
in this world where you are not
is there a right to choose?
when the one who you love killed himself for you
I do not seek to understand us
I do not seek anymore of us
to burn of love leaves you in ashes
but remain hidden with the cold of you
me, I die of love
me, I die of love
Romeo, Romeo
life without you is only a word
Romeo, I love you too much
so that tonight the day will lie down
without the taste of you on my mouth
Romeo, Romeo
I arrive await me on high
Romeo I love you too much
so that tomorrow the day will awake
without the taste of you on my lips
perhaps you have pain
me, I have had so much for you
I leave you with your hate
but leave me to go far from you
me, I die of love
me, I die of love
Romeo, Romeo
life without you is only a word
Romeo, I love you too much
so that tonight the day will lie down
without the taste of you on my mouth
Romeo, Romeo
I arrive await me on high
Romeo I love you too much
so that tomorrow the day will awake
without the taste of you on my lips<I Don't Know>
I don't know, I don't know
if I believe in man or if I don't
if God is still in my life
Oh, I don't know, I am lost
for you I have left all
I gave you my soul
for you I renounced
the tender caresses of women
I believed in your kindness
but I have lost mine
I cannot love anymore
all these men filled with hate
and I envy the apostles, I envy all those who believe
I am a man like any other Who softly drowns
and loses faith
I don't know, I don't know
what it is that you wanted
that men love each other and then kill each other?
Oh, I don't know, I am lost
for you I have pardoned
for you I have done good
for you I have heard their secrets but mine
a little more each day
becoming heavier and heavier
I cry but you are deaf
I have lost my love
Oh, God it's my prayer
it's worth that of my brothers
I am a man like them
on my knees in front of God
and I am unhappy
however I remember
before I blaspheme
I could say I love you to who I met
life was easy
it was enough to love
but the ink of the gospels
in my heart has dried
Oh, God for all mankind
you who know all on all
hear the voice of a man
who tells you on his knees
that he is becoming mad
I don't know, I am lost
I don't know, no, I don't know
what it is that you wanted
that men love each other and then kill each other?
Oh, I don't know, I am lost
I don't know, no, I don't know
I believe in man or if I don't
if God is still in my life
Oh, I don't know, I am lost
I don't know no!...
<Guilty>
our lives are not any more
than lost boats
why live still
when our children are dead?
and that God and men
see what we are
their souls of crystal
pardon us for the bad
that our gods in anger
let us make them
and may they rest in peace
and may they love forever
one judges us, one blames us
them in paradise, us in flames
it's here that 'Romeo and Juliette' is finished
one judges us, one blames us

to love is the grandest thing
to love is stronger than all
to give the best of us
to love and to feel one's heart
to love to have no fear
to love is the most beautiful thing
to love is to go up so high
and touch the wings of birds
to love is the most beautiful thing
to love is to steal time
to love is to remain living
and to burn to the heart of a volcano
to love is the grandest thing
to love is to burn in the nights
to love is to pay the price
and to give a direction to one's life
to love is to burn in the nights
to love is the most beautiful thing
to love is to go up so high
and touch the wings of birds
to love is the most beautiful thing
to love...
<The Kings of the World>
the kings of the world live to the summit

they confuse the dogs and the wolves
they make traps where they will fall one day
they protect themselves from everything, even from love
the kings of the world fight with each other
there is not room for two of them
and us down here don't fight their wars
we don't even know why all these games of kings are necessary
we make love we live life Day after day, night after night
what is the point of being alive If we have to live on our knees
we know that time is like the wind Living is important
we have no morals We know we do nothing wrong
we make love we live life Day after day, night after night
what is the point of being alive If we have to live on our knees [What is the point of being alive] We know that time is like the wind Living is important

gunshot. - Really?
no.
neighbor's dog. I think I was, like, 5.
mean little bugger.
you or the dog?
both, probably.
what about this guy?
the one on your wrist.
Oh, I was building a dock at the cabin.
there was a piece of wood with a nail in it.
it really didn't hurt that much.
everything all right?
Yeah. I'm just... Getting a glass of water.
Hey, I was actually worried. You know, you could've called.
well, I figured you'd be asleep.
I was up all night cleaning.
Hey, you know they make this thing, it's like an - Uh, it's like an eraser, you can get stains off the walls?
you actually cleaned our apartment?
well, it's a long weekend.
Denise is coming down from Timmins.
well, I haven't heard you talk about her in a while.
I figured you guys broke up.
we did once, in the 11th grade, but she took me back.
is she gonna be here all weekend?
Why?
because I just found out in the best possible way, flight attendants have a serious thing for cops.
last night-two-on-one.
tonight they have a friend that wants to meet you.
Denise wants me to propose.
propose what?
well, she says that, um...
She-she told me, actually, that it's been way too long without a real commitment, and, um, you know, seven years, so...
what the hell are you gonna do?
no clue, man.
you walked out on him? - Yeah, I did.
cause I'm - I don't know. I'm used to being alone, you know?
I like to sleep in my own bed.
I think it's weird. - You're weird.
okay, you're not, but you're touchy this morning.
I know. It's my k-i-d.
Oh, right. They can't spell.
well, if I'd known you couldn't keep a secret to save your life...
come on. You have an adorable 6-year-old.
I don't know why it has to be a secret.
well, it's on my own terms, okay?
Everyone'd treat me different, look at me different.
so what's up with Leo?
hates me, hates my job, wants to go live with daddy, all because he can't go to the fenelon fair this saturday.
and what am I supposed to do? Tell him his dad bowed out on him at the last minute?
so what's daddy's problem? - Oh, daddy's distracted.
he's slipping' it to a yoga teacher he met in N.A.
who's slipping' it to the yoga teacher they met at N.A.?
your mother. Hey, Chris.
Hey, careful. Man's on a deadline.
he's gotta propose or lose the girl he's loved since he had grass on the field.
so...
are you gonna propose?
well, you know, I love her, so...
why not, right?
well, congratulations.
Thanks.
yeah,'cause it's a good plan.
why play the field in the big city with your best friend when you can restrict yourself to your banjo-playing second cousin?
you know what? Denise is a special girl, and I'm not
and I'm sure you'll be very happy together. Come on.
Hey. - Right.
and you are?
sorry.
it's just, you know, I have trouble sleeping in other people's beds.
it's weird, I know. It's just this thing that I have.
it's all right. I get it.
it's just, you know, when you wake up alone and you wonder where someone's gone, it can kind of ruin your whole day.
well, it's early. Your day could still turn around.
you joining us for parade?
Yes, sir. - Okay, then. Anytime.
everybody's got a plan.
everyone's off to the cottage with a case of beer and a fistful of firecrackers.
everyone's gonna spend three long days grilling and lounging on the dock
everyone but you,'cause you are working.
detective erico?
go get 'em.
last long weekend, there were 11 high-end b&es
total take estimated close to $600, 000.
last week, they assaulted a housekeeper when she walked in on them, so proceed with caution.
it's one crew, highly organized. They work with a lookout, carry radios.
alarm goes off, they don't care. They're in and out in four minutes.
want to come over later?
I'll scare up a couple of steaks, throw 'em on the barbie?
I'm busy later.
Really? But I've already got them. They're filet mignon.
anything to add, detective barber? - You bet.
uh, one thing you should know is they are dangerous.
housekeeper caught them in the act, and they put the boots to her.
so what I suggest to you is proceed with caution.
serve, protect... And grill when you're retired.
go on. Get out there.
so has, uh, Noelle let you drive yet?
not yet.
Yeah, it's fun.
hey...
my brother told me about this new sushi place on king, and, well, it's always full. But since the suits are all headed out of town this weekend, well, you know, if you maybe want to grab lunch or maybe after shift, get something to eat...
you and me? - It's not a big deal.
I just thought maybe if you were hungry. - No, no, it-it sounds fun.
it's just I can't 'cause I got - plans this weekend. - Fine.
sorry. - Whatever.
some other time. - Yeah, sure.
1503, advising on...
go ahead, 1503.
look, no one will pass me.
you are so evil.
these people are already staring down a barrel of stop-and-go traffic all the way up the 400.
Oh, oh, oh! Oh!
he didn't go far.
stop it.
you involved with Callaghan?
I'm just saying, you might want to be a little careful, you know?
callaghan's good, solid police, but, uh, he picks a different rookie every year.
Thanks, yeah. I can take care of myself.
Ah, the cat who walks by herself.
exactly.
the cheese stands alone.
you, of all people, should understand that.
stand by for the hotshot.
we've got a b&e in progress at 37 Chadwick.
the homeowner is in the house and reported that the front door was forced open by a male party.
light it up.
1505. We're en route.
see ya.
homeowner alone with infant, hiding upstairs, bedroom closet.
says she can hear the intruder downstairs.
okay, hit the gas, peck. Go.
I am.
wait. Is it-is it a left here?
no, stop. It's...
I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry.
home invasion. They'll wait, I guess.
I'm sorry.
please be advised. There is a guard dog on the premises.
get around back. Cut him off.
stop! Police!
could you calm down if I said, "nice boy"?
that's it. Nice boy. Nice boy!
what the hell are you doing? Get that guy!
okay. - All right.
that hurts.
...en route for medical treatment.
I need to call my husband. - Sure.
it's just time's of the essence, so if I could ask you a few questions first...
um, Nash, could you help out Mrs. Wright?
Martha. Martha is fine.
here.
I have to call Paul. He's at work.
I told him it's a long weekend. No one else is going in.
so no one knew that you were headed to the cottage today?
no. - No one else?
you didn't stop the newspaper or ask someone to bring in the mail?
no, look, it was just for the long weekend.
okay.
this guy wasn't that organized.
Andy chased him, said he was tripping over the cord of a $90 dvd player.
and she couldn't catch him?
well, if it's just one guy, it's not our b&e gang.
that crew works in a group.
they're pros...
and they're sure as hell not gonna be wasting their time on a DVD player.
there's no sign of entry or exit from the lower level.
this is s1. Let's let piv handle it from here.
copy.
nothing down here.
of course there's nothing down here.
look, I know it's my fault the guy got away.
it's just that there was the dog, and I thought he was gonna hurt you.
that's why there's two of us, right?
one to deal with the dog, one to get the bad guy.
there's no one back there.
house is clear. Let's head out.
after you. - Oh, hey, so I heard you pinned that dog.
those German shepherds - They freak me out.
Yeah, bark, bite - Dogs don't scare me.
heavy sucker, though.
Yeah, so if you make it down by 2: 00, then just-just come on in.
okay. Yep. Well, I can't wait.
okay. Bye, babe. Bye.
did you just invite Denise to lunch?
well, you know, it's just everyone's out of town.
it's dead.
it's not like i'm gonna miss anything if I take her to lunch, so
except maybe the prime of your life
moments like I had last night when I realized I was buying drinks for two airline hotties, trying to decide which one I wanted to take home, and then I realized I didn't have to choose.
it's detective erico.
I need a good cop. Anyone free?
for an interrogation? - Pawnshop owner, interview three.
tried to sell Boyko a $50, 000 rolex on the cheap.
we traced it back to one of our b&es.
boyko was in a pawnshop? - A watch costs $50, 000?
Diaz, huh?
you're looking particularly good to me.
can I- - You can watch.
I need...
big boy's in there saying he's gonna have a heart attack if I ask him any more questions.
thought I'd give him a couple minutes.
to do what? - We're primates.
so? Chris doesn't believe in evolution.
so primates can't stand to be alone.
stick a monkey in a cage by himself for a couple of days, he'll cuddle with a kleenex.
couple weeks, he'll droop and die.
well, what if he does? - Does what?
well, you know, have a heart condition or something.
he's not gonna have a heart attack.
he's not even short of breath.
the guy's lying out of his ass.
just go in there and cuddle, diaz.
Hey.
I don't care if it was one guy or 20 guys, you cannot leave me alone here.
ma'am, the suspect's long gone. - I haven't even reached my husband yet.
please don't go - at least until he gets home.
okay, okay, okay.
officer Mcnally can stay with you.
well, armed b&e is a 2-officer minimum.
he wasn't armed.
fine. Nash can stay with Mcnally.
well, can I ride back with you, sir?
because officer Shaw's gone back to the barn.
sounds good to me.
this is your occurrence number, ma'am.
insurance is gonna want that.
can I get you a soda or something?
how the hell's that gonna help? You got the heat blasting.
it is hot in here.
uh, it's not just in here, though.
it's, uh, it's the whole office.
we're still finessing the art of interrogation.
that's why I wanted a rookie.
I needed to get a baseline on this guy, see how he acts when he's not threatened.
toad on a lily pad.
he's barely moving - Conserving his energy for his big show.
I told you, I get chest pains.
Oh, look at you. You're a mess...
stuttering about a heart attack, squirming.
turn off the cameras.
uh, I don't think we're supposed to
turn them off.
this one's a rookie.
likes to play by the rules.
okay, Ronald...
I'm gonna hook you up to a lie detector.
there's no lie detector in here.
I'm the lie detector.
you know, you can't turn the cameras off.
you see me?
I'm not new.
I've been doing this for about 11 years.
somewhere along the way, I realized I can do whatever I like.
stand up!
I think I want an attorney.
I- I-I don't know where they get the stuff.
okay, okay.
they told me today there'd be a load of silver and china.
silver from where? - I don't know. They don't tell me.
Ron! Please don't lie to me!
what kind of silver?
I don't know.
uh, bowls, um, trays, salad tongs.
last time I got - I got two bread makers still in their boxes.
sorry, it's just...
kind of sounds like they're robbing a wedding.
you know what?
kind of does.
sweetie, please.
I heard something breaking. I called 911. The guy was right downstairs.
no, I'm-look, could you just come home?
no, he's not here anymore, but, um...
can't you tell your client it's the long weekend?
Oh, my god.
come home already.
what kind of workaholic is this guy?
the douche bag kind.
I guess he figures she's got the dog to keep her safe.
Yeah, a lot of good that did.
the dog didn't even bark at the guy who broke in this morning.
did I tell you Gail asked me to go for sushi?
I think, as, like, friends.
what?
cold fish with Gail? Go figure.
my husband might be a while.
um, okay.
uh, maybe we should do an inventory, see what's missing.
he wants me to drive to the cottage without him - The baby, the dog, just me.
you'd think he could take the weekend, right?
but no.
and then some loser breaks into my house, and...
sorry.
excuse me.
that was leo's day care, and it's a long weekend, so they're having a half day.
and I don't know - Maybe I forgot, but I don't think that I forgot, but I
okay, Traci, calm down.
can your mom go?
I can't get ahold of her.
fine. Go. I'll be fine on my own.
half-hour, I swear. I'll be right back.
okay, I'll tell the station.
no, no, no, no. Please, please.
if you tell them I'm gone, they're gonna ask why.
they're not gonna ask why, but I've gotta say something.
Andy, look around.
do you see a lot of women on this job - A lot of moms with a kid juggling this job?
Leo is sitting there. I gotta go.
go.
half an hour. I swear. Thank you.
I'd better check on the baby.
do you-do you mind coming upstairs with me?
sure.
I don't even know what a bread maker is, and you're like, bread maker equals wedding?
it-it wasn't the bread maker.
it was the salad tongs.
Yeah, me and Denise- That's what we'd always get people as a wedding gift
you know, silver ones, get 'em engraved, uh, "may these be your salad days," love, Chris and Denise.
still don't really know what that means, but
good news, bad news.
uh, good news is there really is only one wedding scheduled for today in rosedale, so that kind of narrows it down.
bad news?
thanks to boy genius here, we gotta stake it out, which could be a total waste of the day.
a stakeout?
are you serious?
we" as in "all of us"?
you boys up for it?
could be, uh, could be kind of dangerous.
no stranger to danger, man.
Yeah, we're - we're totally up for it, sir.
all right, well, good.
suit up.
sir, wouldn't we be a more intimidating presence in our uniforms?
Yeah, diaz...
you, uh, would be a couple of uniform cops walking into the house that's presumably being watched by our bad guys.
nobody is gonna take a second look at a couple more guests showing up in suits.
buttons in the front...
tags in the back.
come on!
human lie detector.
that was amazing.
I thought you couldn't turn off the cameras.
you can't. She didn't. That was just some random remote.
Hey, did you see the way Erico looked at you?
you propose to Denise, you might miss out on your very own sergeant sexy.
what kind of jerk robs a wedding?
who cares?
we're going undercover.
where is Leo?
so sorry, Ms. Nash, but we had to lock up.
you locked him in?
we called his dad.
do you mind? - Excuse me?
your g-u-n is in my son's face.
what do you mean, you called his dad?
you're an hour late.
so you just handed my kid over to Dex?
please move.
I don't think it's appropriate you wearing a g-u-n to pick up a child at this day care.
okay, lady, this g-u-n is safety holstered, and the trigger guard is on.
I have it because it is my j-o-b.
so your partner has a child?
sorry.
how does she manage, being a cop and taking care of a kid?
um, well, we're sort of new, so I guess she doesn't really know yet.
I can't imagine.
when I was your age, I didn't know what I was doing, let alone how to do it with a baby.
Oh, you have another kid?
he's 22 now.
never really got along with Paul.
Noah didn't make it very easy - Juvenile, drugs.
paul paid for rehab.
right after Noah got out, he ended up in quinley's.
prison?
three years, trafficking.
crystal meth. It's...
well, you love your kid, no matter what.
Yeah, prison - It's tough.
how's he doing?
Swarek.
Mrs. Wright has a son from a previous marriage - 22.
uh, he was locked up a couple years ago for trafficking.
she doesn't tell us this at the scene?
well, he's still in prison, but could you just check anyway?
Noah Davis, born 1988.
one and two are in play.
about damn time.
sorry? - You boys better have David.
I mean, come on. My daughter's headed to the altar, and there's no groom?
Mr. Burton, we believe your house may be the target of a robbery this afternoon.
can we come in?
uh, you- You lost you-your groom?
I'm here with Mr. Burton. I'll keep you posted.
over and out.
I swear, they get younger every year.
man. "over and out.
Hey, You know what I would do if I was gonna knock that house over?
infiltrate the alarm company?
you're kidding, right?
get a job to do a job?
I'd walk up. I would knock, flash my badge, and I'd tell them that we think their house is about to get robbed.
I was on my way there to get him.
it's no problem.
just glad you're here.
we're about to head out to the cottage.
well, maybe you could take leo along.
jeez, Traci, I don't know.
I mean, it's Della's parents' place, and...
sorry, okay?
just, it's the long... - Weekend, I know.
well, I gotta get back to work, so maybe you could just go get me my child.
Hey, what'd you get?
Noah Davis was released from prison on Saturday.
might want to tell his mom to keep better track of him.
well, did he get released to anyone?
according to his parole officer, uh, he's staying with a guy named...What?
at 16 Nicholas street. - 16 Nicholas street.
smart money says he's our runner.
we're on our way there now.
great, okay.
all right.
get to the church already.
good.
so you think these thieves are gonna try the old, uh, "knock, knock, we're making a delivery" routine?
not if they know everybody's gone.
if it were me-throw on a mask, knock down the front door, in and out, five minutes.
well, but, Jess, you have bigger balls than the average criminal.
50 bucks says that they show up decked out like party rental delivery guys.
double it.
these guys are pros.
all right, well...
I might have to hit an A. T.M.
we're taking pictures, for god sakes.
look at you.
take a little responsibility.
no, I'm sorry, baby.
it was last-minute.
they think these guys are breaking into houses while everyone's away at the church for the wedding.
well, so we're staking it out.
what she sees in you, I have no idea, but, son, you'd better deliver
not just today but for the rest of your life!
Yes...Sir.
no, I don't know how long.
baby, this is - This is gonna be huge.
I just...
I guess Denise really had her heart set on lunch, huh?
so where's Noah?
you think I'm funny?
you're the guy the dog took down, right?
I am that guy. How come you're not?
Noah brought doggy treats.
he didn't need 'em. The dog just wagged his tail and jumped all over him.
man, I never could understand why people let dogs lick their face.
Yeah, me neither. Where's noah?
I don't know, man.
I-I was just along for the ride, man.
Noah said if I could get us past the alarm, I could take whatever I wanted.
so, uh, rob mom and dad-that was Noah's brilliant plan, huh?
they wasn't supposed to be there.
anyhow, it's not his dad.
it's his stepdad.
he really hates the guy - edible thing.
edible?
Yeah, you know, loves mommy, wants to kill daddy. That thing.
so where's Noah now?
I don't know. Cops came. Dog went all ape. I ran.
Noah was in the basement.
you took off, but Noah didn't?
I have no idea, man.
for all I know, he's still down there.
why wouldn't he call me? Why wouldn't he tell me he was out?
well, I mean, you - you never went to see him.
after the whole rehab fiasco, paul sort of made it clear it was either him or Noah.
but still...
Martha, I'm home!
I'm up here, honey!
tell me they didn't get the video camera.
that camera was brand-new.
this is who they sent?
you called 9-1-1, they sent her?
actually, there were a lot of officers and cars here, but I was left to keep mrs. Wright company until you came home.
other cars and officers.
you clowns didn't catch the guy, did you?
amazing.
nice work.
you'll wake her.
should've known.
so they let you out. Let me guess-um, good behavior?
stay away from me.
well, genius, you're headed right back there now.
did you, uh, do you want to say hi to your mother first?
leave me alone. I'm outta here.
what's the matter?
you're scared to see her, huh? Is that it?
Yeah, let me go. Let me go! I mean it!
you little punk! Stealing my stuff. What now, huh?
off to get high?
right, your house, your wife, your stuff -.
I told you to leave me alone
police! Don't move.
what are you doing?!
nobody move!
come on Mcnally. Come on, pick up!
mom, I just need you to take him till after I finish shift.
buddy, hey, you're gonna be at your dad's next weekend, okay? All weekend.
thank you. Thanks, mom. Thanks, okay.
Yeah, I'll see you in five. Thanks.
who's that lady with daddy?
That's...Your dad's friend who has a cottage.
Nash. - Get everyone out of the house.
I think the son's still in there.
I'm not there.
what the hell you mean, you're not there? Where are you?
what do you think of me now, Paul?
you wouldn't dare. - Noah, put the gun down.
Oh, big man. You got my gun.
you even know how to fire it?
Noah, please put the gun down.
I'll show you. - What are you doing, paul?
I hate you! - Don't make this worse than it already is.
stop talking, okay?
don't you see? It's Noah's job to make things worse.
Paul, stop it. - That's how he gets her attention.
Noah, listen to me. You can't solve this with a gun.
you don't know what he's done to my mom.
Noah, this is not Paul's fault!
you treat the dog better than you treat me! - I love you!
come on. You're a drug addict, a criminal.
you think she wants you around?
let the woman have a fresh start already.
would you shut it?
Noah, your mother loves you.
okay, she may be mixed up, but she loves you.
don't give me that, okay? - I do! You know that I do!
cause you don't know. You don't know.
yeah? You think I don't know?
I was abandoned in the middle of the night by my mother.
okay, she has an entirely new family, and I was completely erased.
it messes you up. I know.
I haven't seen my mother in 14 years.
your mother is right here.
don't do this.
come on. Put the gun down.
please, Noah. Just put it down. It's okay.
put down the gun.
I'm sorry.
stop! Paul! - In my house?
you piece of trash! - Don't hurt him!
Paul, stop it! - How do you like that?
No!
get your hands off me!
be quiet! - I've got the gun, sir.
don't move.
I need E. N.S. On scene at 37 chadwick.
Paul, are you hurt?
hear anything, boys?
no. You guys see anything?
uh, not so far. This is one sleepy street.
and to think my day started out so well.
huh? Oh, yeah. Flight attendants.
so what did you even do with those two girls?
well, that was the beautiful thing about these two girls.
kid's radio's on.
he must be sitting on it.
Yeah, every rookie does it once. I never did.
I mean, they were running the show, totally and completely. Wasn't up to me.
are you lying?
I mean, these girls - They really know how to take charge.
that's what i'm trying to say. That's what you're missing out on.
I hope I'm making myself clear, because flight attendants - In charge.
you're doing the hand thing, but you're moving 'em all around, and you're doing that eye - you're lying.
I'm not lying. - Yes.
no, I'm not lying.
I slept over.
I knew - you slept over? - Yeah, I slept over.
it was late. They were hungry.
they got some food, and then they had to catch a flight.
you're so full of it. - Okay, whatever.
when was the last time you had a threesome with two smokin' hot chicks?
have you ever even slept with somebody who wasn't Denise?
see the look on that groom's face today?
you have slept with someone other than Denise, right?
he had the 1, 000-yard stare.
you haven't, have you?
I made out with Krista bloom in the 11th grade, when Denise and I were broken up.
Oh. Okay, good. That's going in the vault. Okay.
I... - Have you?
I don't think I can propose to her.
What's-has your radio been on this whole time?
Oh, there's our guys.
it's go time, rookies. Suspects are on the scene.
looks like three bodies.
okay, boys, bodies coming in. Take down, take down!
let's go.
police! Don't move! Let me see those hands!
I'm fine.
sometimes things go sideways. It's not your fault.
Yeah.
what a cluster. Where's Nash?
what, you telling me Nash isn't here? Where the hell is she?
ask her.
what happened? - Do you not know the number one rule is never, ever leave your partner?
never leave your ...
whose is that? - That's my son.
kid breaks into my house, pulls a gun on me, you put me in handcuffs?
this is a nightmare. Boyko's gonna have my badge.
I'm great. Thanks for asking.
whoa. Hey.
Hey, what? You left me alone.
I- I didn't know. The house was clear.
except it wasn't.
you said you were fine.
well, good thing I was, huh?
well, yeah. You never need anything.
you don't need anyone. Good job.
me? I'm about to get fired. Congrats.
whatever.
I'm trying to sort out exactly what happened.
it's my fault, sir. I left my rookie at the house when we dissolved the perimeter.
I was under the impression that the house had been cleared.
what gave you that impression? - we'd searched it.
Noah knew the house.
I mean, he knew exactly where to hide.
officer mcnally, I need to understand how the hostage situation developed.
like I said, sir, it's my fault.
my gun wasn't loaded.
I forgot to load my gun this morning.
you're not the first.
it happens.
that's why you have a partner.
let me tell you something about partners, okay?
you back 'em up, no matter what. - I know that.
you know that? So why'd you let nash dangle back there?
Boyko's gonna be very unhappy.
Yeah, well, she- - Yeah. You knew she was leaving, right?
you must've told her it was okay.
look, I get it, okay - What you said to that kid.
your mother left you. You felt abandoned.
now you want to stand alone.
but in this job, you can't do it alone.
you have to have each other's back.
you gonna run, or, uh, should I cuff you?
you should probably cuff me.
I'm really sorry about this morning.
it's just... Things get heavy, and I start to get vulnerable, and so I-I take off, every time.
so you're a cop with intimacy issues. Join the club.
look if it doesn't work for you, you don't have to sleep over.
perfect. Then we'll just have sex in your car.
or we could go to your place.
or we don't have to sleep at all.
go to the penny. Laugh with your friends.
it'll be better tomorrow. - Oh, yeah?
it always is.
go on. Get out of here.
three members of our b&e gang locked up, and it's only Friday.
Hey, hey, hey. Look who it is. Look who it is. It's the one-hit wonder.
no, I'm - I shouldn't interrupt.
you guys are probably gonna have a threesome.
so what are you gonna do? - What can I do?
it's gonna be all over the division by tomorrow morning.
no, I meant about Denise. Are you still gonna propose?
can we not talk about that?
Why? - Don't do it, man.
I know, okay. I'm young.
I have my whole life ahead of me.
we already talked about- No, it's-it's not that.
if you get married, then you're gonna have kids, and you're gonna split up, and your kids are gonna have to go back and forth every weekend, living out of their knapsack.
divorce sucks.
the word is that diaz is on - Uh, is on a, uh, deadline.
the man is not into comparison shopping. I can respect that.
well, I can, too. But Timmins, huh?
indeed, indeed.
what is wrong with you guys?
Hey, guys. - Oh, hey, Denise. Let me introduce you.
I've heard so much about you.

I haven't decided yet.

what's wrong with you?
I haven't driven over 60 on this job.
I need a little action.
fine. Then go take the back of the line. They're definitely not getting in.

any pushing or shoving, and you're going home.
sorry to bother you, officer, but security told me That the line was over here, and i was waiting over there, And i didn't want to leave, just in case-i feel ridiculous.
my only job was to stand in line and watch my friend's place,
and now i'm not even in that line.

W-where's your friend?
she's just around the corner.

I'm in a lot behind the communications truck.
please. I'm telling you the truth. It's not mine.
someone must've left it there.
you should be looking for them right now.
I was just minding my own business, going for a walk. And i found it, okay?
look, how many times do i have to tell you?
it was there on the sidewalk.
I- i-i picked it up!
that's probably enough times. So you can shut up now.
I was gonna turn it in to you guys. I swear. - Is that him?
Oscar benson-17, resides at 422 Beckett.
good. Let's get started.
Ident's on the way over to check for g. s. r. So don't let him wash his hands.

Oliver Shaw. I'll be your training officer, uh, until further notice.
you don't touch anything in the car Until, uh, i tell you to.
you don't write anything down in your memo book Until i tell you to.
you don't talk to oth-other people. You look at me first.
you do as i say, not as, um, i do.
I know you probably think right now I'm-i'm being a bit of a hard-ass,
but if it gets stressed out there, i will be, because my - My job is to keep you safe.
this crest, uh, on my shoulder - This represents, you, Mcnally, and we're...
we're both going home today.

McNally. S - sorry.
uh, the roommate wants - Detective Callaghan.
Jo, what are you doing here?
I'm just in to help.
the roommate wants to talk to you. She's in the d's office. If you're up for it.
I hear we got the shooter.
Yeah, looks like. We found a kid with a gun. We're just about to talk to him.
you don't have to do this. Just give 'em your statement. I'll drive you home.
Yeah, you know what? I understand that. I'm fine, okay?
I want to be here. I need to be here.
we'd been in line for, like, an hour.
I mean, she was cold. She's always freezing. So i went to get us some hot chocolate.
and i shouldn't have gone. I shouldn't have waited for it.
I should've just come right back.
Miranda, i get what you're saying, But it wouldn't have changed anything.
she didn't even want to come today.
Kate barely even listens To music. I mean, she listens to classical.
but she says it helps her study.
everything okay? - Yeah.
Yeah, we're just talking about Kate.
okay.
Oscar Benson-no priors, but his brother's in a gang.
doesn't mean he is. - Doesn't mean he isn't.
think it's an initiation?
Yeah, targeting a cop - in certain circles, That might buy you some credibility.
okay, Luke, we got it.
what, are you serious? - Yeah, i called her.
you were in court. I needed backup.
Yeah, but i'm here now, and this guy shot a cop.
a cop who happens to be your girlfriend.
I mean, unless she's not, and you just like to make out
with every cute officer who takes a bullet.
uh, i-it's a conflict.
okay, you do live with her.
Congratulations.
Jerry, this is what i do, all right?
so i'm doing something.
all right, your name goes on nothing, And you have to stay away from this guy.
fine. - I'm gonna take first crack.
uh, all right with you? I'm not really up for playing good cop.
you guys used to partner together, right?
Yeah.
she ever play good cop?
no. - Right.
so the girl you shot's in critical condition.
and guess what else.
you also shot a police officer, Oscar.
I didn't shoot anyone.
can you just tell me who you were aiming for, or should i ask your brother?
my brother has nothing to do with it.
so you did it all by yourself?
that's not what i meant.
I seriously doubt that you were aiming for Kate Novatski,
but i guess that's the problem with shooting into a crowd.
I saw a gun on the sidewalk. I picked it up.
why didn't you come forward?
I wanted to sell it. I could get 500 bucks for that thing.
you found it?
Yeah, that's right.
they took her into surgery at 14: 43.
doesn't look good.
what else can i do?
I'll call you back.
ms. Novatski. - Where's Katie? Is she okay?
she's in surgery right now. I'll take you there.
you were with her? - I was in the ambulance.
was she awake? Responsive? How much blood did she lose?
ma'am, a doctor will give you all that
okay, look, please. I'm a nurse at Oakville general.
I know how these things work.
they're gonna shove me into a waiting room,
and they're not gonna tell me anything until she's out of surgery, so i need to know something.
she was outside at a concert hall. There were shots fired. She got hit.
where? Where was she hit?
it's a head injury.
was there any brain activity?
ms. Novatski, you need to talk to a doctor.
Katie-she wanted to be a... An organ donor.
it was really important to her.
and she's young, and she's, uh... She's healthy, so with a head wound,
she's a very good candidate to be a donor.
so you need to help me.
okay.
somebody must've seen something. We just gotta jog their brains a bit.
charming.
don't judge me. - Too late.
all right, everyone take a seat, over there.
all right, since none of you ran when the shots were fired,
and we didn't find any weapons on you, Right now you're not suspects.
but nobody is going home until we know everything you know.
Yeah, every little detail, and we really don't care If it takes all night.
I'll stay up all night with you.
you'll stay up all night washing the pepper spray Out of your eyes if don't let go of me right now.
all right, who wants to go first?
how about who's had less than six drinks today?
lightweight, you're up.
I got something, but i don't think you're gonna like it.
try me.
2: 33 p. m.- the exact time the gunshots were fired- Oscar Benson was on his phone.
with his gangbanging brother?
no, with his god-fearing mother.
they were on from 2: 26 to 2: 37 p. m.
11 minutes on the phone with his mother.
that'd be a record for me. I'd definitely shoot somebody.
I told you weren't gonna like it.
I like anything that gets us answers.
so maybe he did find the gun. At least we still got the weapon.
that was ballistics.
the gun was jammed, but the bullet we got out of Andy's vest is a match to Oscar's gun.
the gun jammed?
Yeah, that means shot number four never made it out of the barrel.
it's over. I just got back from the hospital. Kate Novatski's not gonna make it.
I need a minute of your time.
Kate Novatski was pre-med.
she wrote her college admissions essay on organ donation.
donor card's complete. It's the only thing her mother wants.
we gotta find a way.
dov, as soon as they take her off the respirator, It becomes a homicide.
chain of evidence, forensics, autopsy - We need the body intact.
she got shot in the head. We know what happened. What do her lungs have to do with it?
what the hell does her heart have to do with it?
d - dov. I get it.
you were there with the mother. It's terrible.
Yeah, it's terrible, but it doesn't have to be meaningless, 'Cause right now that's all it's ever gonna be.
but for this woman, for this family, We have a chance to do something that'll actually help 'em Get through this, so come on, please.
fine. So we get a signed confession today, before they take her Off the respirator, before they do the autopsy.
I'll make a case to the coroner, and we take it from there.
no, seriously, let's work it out.
signed confession today, huh?
Yeah. It's always good to have a goal.
roommate literally laughed When i asked if Kate was involved in anything illicit.
uh, she's an "a" student, full scholarship.
no-no boyfriend, no enemies.
McNally, you gotta go home, okay?
no, i don't need to go home, okay? I don't want to go home. What am i gonna do?
you want me to watch some TV?
you want me - you want me to take a nap?
listen, if i'm gonna figure this thing out,
then i need to understand why...
understand? What are you gonna understand?
shots were fired. You were hit. She was hit. She's on a respirator.
Kate. Kate's not a "she.
it's Kate, and she was standing right next to me,
and-and i-i need to know who she is.
okay.
take the roommate back to residence And talk to her on the way.
okay.
I don't understand.
if Kate's on a respirator, then she's still alive.
not exactly.
the machine's keeping her breathing, But... I'm so sorry.
you know what? I can take you to the hospital right now If you want to see her.
no, i don't want to go there. Her mom is there.
I'm the reason her daughter's dead or-or almost dead Or, like, about to die.
I made her come with me.
I left her there, in line.
I let her in.
I thought i was being nice.
listen, i-if Kate... is really who you say she is,
Then-then... This shot wasn't meant for her.
it was an accident.
it wasn't your fault.
Yes, it was. - Right?
you sound like my philosophy t. a. always trying to make sense of everything
by saying, "nothing makes sense.
it doesn't change the fact that she got shot and she's almost dead or...
all right, what about him looked suspicious?
I didn't say he looked suspicious.
I said he was acting suspicious.
a person isn't suspicious. Their behavior is.
I'm doing my master's in criminology.
well, good for you.
so what about his behavior made him suspicious?
he was sober.
she was standing right in front of me. And i saw the gun in her hand.
or maybe it was a cell phone.
it was one of those flip phones, You know, so it kinda looked like it could've been a gun.
anyone cough up anything yet?
uh, one guy threw up a corn dog.
we got the day to solve this.
okay. - So let's solve it.

you better show us, or i'll arrest your ass For obstruction of justice.
that was so hot.
let's see what you got.
you're still thinking gang, huh?
I guess you're not.
a gun like that is too valuable.
gangbanger's not gonna get rid of it just 'cause it jammed.
well, it's not revenge. It's not like the girl had any enemies.
well, if it ain't revenge and it ain't money...
it's love.
I don't know where it is.
I mean, i've seen her writing in a journal, But i don't know where she keeps it.
okay.
is this her computer?
Yeah.
you know her password?
no, i would never - i wouldn't ask.
she was wearing that coat today.
it's mine. I gave it to her when i left. She was freezing.
you wear that a lot? Every day. I mean...
not now, i guess.
we haven't talked about you. - What about me?
well, we talked about Kate.
we know that she doesn't have any ex-boyfriends, enemies.
well... Unlike my perfect roommate, there are probably
about a million people who hate my guts- A few ex-boyfriends, a couple t. a.s,
but it's not them that i care about.
it's my friend.
who was wearing your coat.
are they printing?
Yeah, they're printing.
they're printing it right now.
did you send me that one from that, uh, the one kid's camera?
you got it? - I'm sending things over right now.
we worked from tweets, tweet pics, tweetdeck Hootsuite, facebook, and cell phone photos.
not a clue what you're talking about.
all these pictures were taken moments before the shots were fired.
now it's possible someone accidentally took a picture of the shooter.
all right, bring 'em in.
all right, everybody, i want you to grab a marker And take a look at these photographs.
if you've seen any of these people with this girl
the girl who got shot today - i want you to circle their face.

you ever seen him with this girl?
no, i don't think so.
but i've seen him with-with her.
that's Kate's roommate.
we should call Andy. - I'm gonna grab detective Rosati.
and the student becomes the master.
I wouldn't go that far.

I was in charge today.
I was in charge, and she got shot.

I thought if we caught the guy, and maybe i could understand
why this happened, that i would feel better.

eventually forget about this, but... You can't.
