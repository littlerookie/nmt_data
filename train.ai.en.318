but here, too, chiasma is to be found, since it is this last field, supposedly created to perceive things in diminished lighting, which provides the maximum possibility of perceiving the effects of light.
but here, too, there was a sex-linked wrinkle.
but here, we don't disturb the body till forensics has a chance
but here, we have Oaksburg's greatest rehabilitation story.
but here, we prefer to have a mental health professional
but here, we're gonna start real simple.
but here, well, the scales are tipped back my way.
but here, what are we going to rob here?

but hermione already hates the class, taken to it's natural conclusion means she's gone by easter.

but hero in life who did what is right.
but hero...
but herod, hearing of it, said, he whom I beheaded, john, this one was raised!

but hess corp. shareholders did far worse: a negative 25% return as the company's profit fell 20%.
but hessel's sales also reveal something about france, and about the left everywhere.
but hester ought long ago to have done with this injustice. What did it betoken? Had seven long years, under the torture of the scarlet letter, inflicted so much of misery, and wrought out no repentance?
but hester ought long ago to have done with this injustice.

but hey, it's America.
but hey, it's a dream team.

but hey, it's just an offer.
but hey, it's not my brain that man's handling.
but hey, it's not personal. So you're okay, though?

mr abe's grandfather was nobusuke kishi.
mr abe's grandfather was nobusuke kishi.
mr abe's grandfather, nobusuke kishi, was among those jailed as war criminals, although he was never tried and went on to become prime minister in 1957.
mr abe's move to the centre-though potentially reversible-may have parallels with mr watanabe's own change of heart, argues temple's prof kingston.
mr abe's office says that no pressure was put on mr fukui to hold rates when he was called in last week for a friendly chat.
mr abe's office says that no pressure was put on mr fukui to hold rates when he was called in last week for a friendly chat.
mr abe's questioning of past japanese apologies to neighbouring countries for brutality during invasions in the 1930s and 1940s infuriates china and south korea.
mr abe, a regular up to now, is a more pragmatic character.
mr abe, either for domestic political reasons or out of conviction that he should be able to mourn japan's war dead in any way he pleases, might one day pay his respects at yasukuni.
mr abe, who describes himself as "a politician who fights," has chosen a cabinet dominated by conservatives and kept the hawkish taro aso in his previous post as foreign minister.
mr abe, who has made reviving the economy a centrepiece of his campaign, argues that more aggressive monetary policy and a hefty increase in debt-funded infrastructure spending would put an end to the mild deflation that many economists say has hobbled japanese growth since the 1990s.
mr abe, who is the grandson of a former prime minister once accused of war crimes, has refused to say whether or not he will visit tokyo's yasukuni shrine, which honours convicted war criminals among japan's war dead.
mr abhisit and his key government ally, the finance minister, korn chatikavanij, say they are cosmopolitan, fiscally conservative market liberals.
mr abhisit deserves credit for calling for elections and for accepting defeat with good grace.
mr abhisit has argued that an election, in itself, will not solve thailand's political problems.
mr abhisit has looked less stiff on the stump than in past elections, though it doesn't come naturally.
mr abhisit hoped breakaway parties formed from the remnants of mr thaksin's former machine would win seats for his coalition.
mr abhisit is under pressure from hardliners who want to use force to crush the protests.
mr abhisit lacks both influence and legitimacy. To earn both, he will need to face the voters.
mr abhisit says he is a reformer, who will heal divisions.
mr abhisit told the red-shirt leaders that an election should be held after constitutional amendments were completed and a budget was passed in the autumn.
mr abhisit took power in a nasty recession.
mr abhisit was ushered into power after months of demonstrations paralysed the previous administration.
mr abhisit would object to such a description, but his class betrays little sympathy or interest in the aspirations of rural and working-class voters.
mr abhisit's coalition will probably be big electoral spenders.
mr abhisit's democrat party faces two charges of financial irregularities in the constitutional court, which has the power to dissolve the party or ban its officers.
mr abhisit's democrat party rejects this but is evasive on its own formula for reform, if any.
mr abhisit's democrat party, which heads the ruling coalition, justifiably fears that, in a free and fair election, voters would, as on the past three occasions, elect a government loyal to thaksin shinawatra, a former prime minister.
mr abhisit's dependence on the generals means he is unlikely to be able to probe army misdeeds very thoroughly.
mr abhisit's supporters hope that continued growth and a large dollop of welfare spending will save him from defeat when parliamentary elections are held, sometime next year.
mr abid said the training his company is doing is "just a drop in the ocean."
mr abolfotoh's campaign has inspired unlikely followers.
mr abott paused before making the important decision.

mr abraha was recently replaced as part of a shake-up of the company, which has seen a portfolio of state-owned transit and warehousing facilities added to it.

mr abrahams will run alone.

mr abrams, who serves on tefaf's board (and its old masters vetting committee), smiles in anticipation as he says, "I think it is really going to take off."

mr ackermann is due to retire in 2013.
mr ackermann speaks with the authority of a man who steered his bank through the crisis more deftly than most.
mr ackermann was not the bank's chief executive in 2001, when the first, admitted, case of surveillance of a supervisory board member took place.
mr ackermann's lingering involvement also suggests that deutsche's strategy will not change markedly.
mr ackman says herbalife's marketing materials give a misleading impression of how easy it is to make money by selling its products.
mr ackman's central charge is that herbalife operates with the primary aim of recruiting distributors into its network the chief characteristic of a pyramid scheme rather than selling products to consumers.
mr ackman's pershing square capital investment fund has given no details of objectives, but wall street analysts expect him to focus on capital structure rather than the company's much-applauded operating performance.
mr ackoff spent most of the past half-century as the premier evangelist of systemic thinking, which he contrasted with the reductionist, atomistic thinking that had long dominated humanity's approach to problem-solving in his view.
mr ackroyd describes how he needed the drug-induced relief to maintain his ferocious pace of writing.
mr ackroyd describes how on their grand tour dickens suggested they grow moustaches, then compared collins's effort to "the eyebrows of his one-year-old child."
mr ackroyd had him come here to demonstrate.
mr ackroyd is a consummate literary critic and he neatly weaves analysis of collins's works into the chronology of his life.
mr ackroyd offers little analysis, but this allows readers to believe or not, as they wish.
mr ackroyd's been murdered.
mr ackroyd's biography of the writer who died at the age of 40 after an alcoholic bender is almost as vivid and flawed as poe himself.
mr acton smith adds: "obviously, I have more responsibility than I once had and I do have to find a balance between having fun and having a serious role."

mr adelson said he was confident the gaming industry had barely scratched the surface of chinese demand, and said only about 2 per cent of china's population visited macau, compared with 13 per cent of the us population that visited las vegas.
mr adelson said the complex would help transform macao into a "capital of entertainment in asia for asians."
mr adelson seems even more excited about attracting the "whales": punters who wager around$ 150000 per hand, of whom there are estimated to be less than 250 in the world.
mr adelson's advisers now say their shortage of hotel inventory is costing them customers.
mr adelson's impact on the republican debate has been direct.
mr adelson's las vegas sands (lvs) hopes to create a "euro vegas," capable of attracting the 1 billion people who live in the 50 countries within a five-hour flight from spain.
mr adelson, 76, also dismissed concerns about succession at las vegas sands an issue raised by some investors during the company's roadshow.
mr adelson, by contrast, opened the sands macao in may 2004, demonstrating the depth of the territory's mass-market.
mr aderico hopes that "peace lessons" in schools will create a less violent generation of alagoans.
mr adkerson says freeport mcmoran is "very optimistic" about china in the longer term, while analysts at macquarie believe that "in 12 months, we will look back at the upcoming three months as the opportunity to buy."

mr adler is looking at extending fx services directly to small and medium size enterprises.
mr adoboli argued that his colleagues knew of and even occasionally used the same trading methods.

mr agassi argues that, as he has a complete system in place, he is better compared with apple.

mr ahern was asked to name and give the addresses of the people who had contributed to the two loans, and a schedule of the associated repayments with interest he had said had been made.
mr ahluwalia says the commission cannot overrule ministers but has "the power to put things on the agenda; to push and persuade."
mr ahmad, imprisoned in britain for over eight years without being charged, would doubtless agree.
mr ahmadi-nejad has sought to make some concessions.
mr ahmadi-nejad said in reference to countries with nuclear weapons: "anyone who possesses a [ nuclear] stockpile is politically retarded."
mr ahmadi-nejad was attending the same summit in istanbul.
mr ahmadinejad also came to office in a vote last year that was--at least partially--democratic.
mr ahmadinejad and his coterie have succeeded brilliantly in portraying the regime's quest for nuclear "technology" (it is careful never to speak of nuclear weapons) as a matter of national pride.
mr ahmadinejad certainly has millions of enthusiasts, particularly in areas beyond the scrutiny of tehran's chattering classes.
mr ahmadinejad dismissed turkey's mediation.
mr ahmadinejad has a reputation for bold and controversial action but the firing of his foreign minister, just weeks before the resumption of talks with foreign powers over iran's nuclear programme, has led to more head-scratching than usual.
mr ahmadinejad has also visited bolivia, where he hugged its populist leader, evo morales.
mr ahmadinejad may even be thinking of subtly challenging the supreme leader by boosting the influence of his own faction of millenarian technocrats, who are allied with the security forces, against more traditional conservatives who are aligned with the clergy.
mr ahmadinejad may find that changing those is much harder than swapping ministers.
mr ahmadinejad taunted the americans for their heavy-handed approach to tackling terrorism.
mr ahmadinejad won a popular election.
mr ahmadinejad's conservatism has added to their woes.
mr ahmadinejad's populism still wins admirers and gets the backing of the hawkish security apparatus and the courts.
mr ahmadinejad's proposal, at the summit, to pursue a regional security pact "without foreign influence" was viewed sceptically, as merely a way for iran to replace america as the gulf's guardian.
mr ahmadinejad, it seems, is out to prove that his punchy chauvinism, rather than mr khatami's quiet diplomacy, will win the islamic republic its rightful place in the sun.
mr ahn's provincial government will reserve the right to "come up with alternatives" if they run into problems implementing the central government's project.
mr ahrens attributed the improvement in the company's performance in china to strong progress in bringing acer computers into electronics retailers all over china, and an unexpectedly strong performance of founder's commercial desktop pcs.

mr ahya of morgan stanley thinks that infrastructure spending will still be an adequate 8% of gdp this fiscal year.
mr ai has not been heard of since being bundled away.
mr ai has said the conditions of his bail forbid him from speaking to media.
mr ai was detained on april 3 at beijing's international airport as he was preparing to board a flight to hong kong.
mr ai was easily the best-known of chinese activists in the west, which helps to explain his release while many others remain unaccounted for.
mr ai's fate and that of other dissidents was a key topic of discussion during a sino-european human rights dialogue held late last week in beijing.
mr ai, an artist who is famous abroad, was detained in beijing as he attempted to board a flight to hong kong on april 3rd.

mr alasania says the government intimidated his financial backer, but acknowledges that television coverage of the campaign was balanced.
mr albanese conceded that the market was in a "delicate position" after falls in iron ore and steelmaking coal prices.
mr albanese insisted, however, that rio's balance sheet was in good shape and that it could afford to wait for markets to recover before selling the businesses, such as alcan's packaging division.
mr albanese said any hold-up of ships carrying ore to china for spot market sales had not had "any material impact" on rio.
mr albanese said rio was not in "active discussions" with any chinese enterprises about ventures offshore but thought such co-operation could bring benefits to both parties.
mr albanese said there was good scope for agreeing joint ventures with chinalco due to china's expertise
mr albanese was one of the first leading mining executives to raise publicly concerns about slowing commodities demand, warning in september of customers requests to delay shipments.
mr albanese's position, already weak, would then be untenable.
mr albanese, explaining this year where rio had gone wrong in the alcan deal, said the shift in chinese production to the west of the country "had the effect of putting more new capacity on to the market than we would have anticipated."
mr alberg points out that friendship can colour someone's view of a prospective work mate's capabilities.
mr albertini, a former mayor of milan who was elected to the european parliament for mr berlusconi's people of freedom (pdl), has followed him by running for governor of lombardy without a pdl endorsement.
mr albright added that the biggest worry was that north korea would seek to sell enrichment technology abroad, particularly since pyongyang has an extensive history in the nuclear black market.
mr albright explains how such latecomers got their start in the nuclear business.
mr albright's institute recently estimated that the three reactors being built would "roughly double pakistan's annual ability to build nuclear weapons to about 19 to 26 nuclear weapons per year."
mr alden, this is one of those dark times in the lives of some of us when all the courage we have is most needed.
mr alder said that while there had been "some resistance" from the banking industry on the issue of criminal liability, there was "no real dispute" that there had been a problem with the existing sponsorship regime.

mr aldrin describes the rockiness of his own post-moon life: alcoholism, depression, two failed marriages and a sad end to his air-force career.
mr alexander and his former colleagues are accused of backdating share options to value them at low points in comverse's share price.
mr alexander expects several other beleaguered european financial groups will seek to raise capital in the coming year by selling their stakes in chinese jvs, which have become increasingly valuable.
mr alexander reckons joint ventures are still an attractive business model for foreign asset managers who want to build a business on the mainland as long as the foreigners are prepared to accept the inherent limitations and can build a rapport with the chinese partner.

mr alford, a former barrister, said the purchase was "purely an investment" as he swore to stop drinking after his release in 1980.
mr ali applied to get it back. He pointed out that he still held title to the vehicle, and that since the buyer had stopped making payments on it, he was entitled to reclaim it.
mr ali's lawyer, scott bullock, argues that this is "clearly designed to intimidate" mr ali into giving up.
mr alien, gratings and barrels, anything that floats, overboard.
mr aliev claims that a deal is imminent.
mr aliev declined to be interviewed.
mr aliev managed to antagonise a number of young politicians and businessmen. This led to the creation of a new opposition, with money in its pockets.
mr aliev will surely win his; the whisper in baku is that his wife will take over next. But another whisper is that, in the absence of democracy, islamism is on the rise-encouraged, say some, by iran to the south.
mr aliev, who is married to dariga nazarbayeva, the eldest of the president's three daughters, has used the website of a news agency that he owns to deny all the charges.
mr alito is her replacement.
mr alizadeh sees progress, though it is slow.
mr allawi has asked foreign governments to help.
mr allawi has frequently threatened to walk away from politics entirely if he is not made prime minister, leaving the sunnis without decent representation.
mr allawi is a moderate but, unlike mr chalabi, he is no secularist.
mr allawi is not sanguine.
mr allawi says the national alliance tried to remove some of his allies from the ballot the night before the poll.
mr allawi's non-sectarian approach in the election could yet harm him when it comes to making wider alliances.
mr allawi's task may be trickier.
mr allawi, himself a shia muslim, believes the mystical (or sufi) tradition must be an integral part of the revival of islamic civilisation.
mr allen and his colleagues made one other observation.

mr ambani dismissed the idea that his company should have bought its equipment from indian companies.
mr ambani has been spared similar mockery.
mr ambani has not been accused of any wrongdoing by the fsa, and is not represented.
mr ambani is one of india's most high-profile business tycoons, but his telecoms, infrastructure and financial services-focused empire has faced falling profits and rising debts in recent years, as india's economy has slowed.
mr ambani runs reliance industries, india's second-largest firm. The oil, textiles and chemicals giant was founded by his father, dhirubhai, who started work as a petrol pump attendant.
mr ambani's move will be watched especially closely by a number of other indian companies, including suzlon energy and tata motors, which are seeking to repay similar forms of short-term foreign denominated debt this year.

mr amelio did manage to stanch the losses inherited from ibm, thanks in part to the booming world economy.

mr anwar called a press conference to claim that he had "firm commitments" from enough government mps to win power.

mr anwar subsequently sought to persuade 30 ruling mps to cross the floor, the same tactic used in perak.
mr anwar was released in 2004 only after it was ruled that testimony against him had been coerced.
mr anwar's accusers have their own skeletons.

mr ao was regarded as one of the top three candidates to be macao's next chief executive, after edmund ho's second term expires in 2009.
