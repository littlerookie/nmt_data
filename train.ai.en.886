nice to see that they're branching out.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
well, I was just looking for Lewis.
try the roof. He's always up there being dumb.
of course. Why didn't I think of that?
mr Steak, you're my only friend.
game didn't go so well, huh?
no, I fell asleep in the ninth inning, and I missed the winning catch.
then I got beat up.
afterwards, Coach took me aside and told me to let it go.
I don't know. He's probably right.
No!
everyone will tell you to let it go and move on, but don't.
instead, let it fester and boil inside of you.
take these feelings and lock them away.
let them fuel your actions.
let hate be your ally, and you will be capable of wonderfully horrid things.
heed my words, Goob. Don't let it go.
what?
where is that boy?
good idea! Separate and look for clues.
look, my dear! Look what I found! It's a stick.
now, what did you find?
Yes. Yes, I see.
time travel residue next to DNA from Wilbur Robinson.
that plus my stick must mean...
to the future! Shotgun!
I don't even know what I'm doing.
keep moving forward.
I mean, this stuff is way too advanced for me.
keep moving forward.
and what if I can't fix this? What are we gonna do?
keep moving forward.
why do you keep saying that?
and don't just say, "Keep moving forward.
it's my dad's motto.
why would his motto be "keep moving forward"?
it's what he does.
what's that supposed to mean?
that is an excellent question.
Robinson Industries, the world's leading scientific-research-and-design factory.
my dad runs the company. They mass produce his inventions.
his motto, "Keep moving forward." It's what he does.
what has he invented? - Everything.
Carl, the time machine, the travel tubes.
your dad invented the time machine?
Yep. Five years ago,
dad wakes up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat.
he wants to build a time machine, so he starts working.
we're talking plans. We're talking scale models.
we're talking prototypes.
that's a prototype?
the very first, or what's left of it. - Yikes.
Yeah. Dark day at the Robinson house.
prototypes two and three, not much better.
number six, 58, 212, 485, 952, and they all end the same way.
but he doesn't give up.
dude, I can't take you seriously in that hat.
he keeps working and working until finally he gets it, the first working time machine.
then he keeps working and working until finally he gets it again, the second working time machine.
kind of small.
I'm assuming that's a joke. I'm ignoring you for time reasons.
this, my friend, is merely a model because, unfortunately, time machine number two is in the hands of the Bowler Hat Guy.
pretty amazing story, huh? - Yeah.
now, are you ready to start working?
I think that's it. I did it!
I knew you could.
nice work, my friend.
well, you know what they say! "Keep moving...
don't say it!
boys! Dinner time!
not now, Mom!
if you aren't up here in five minutes, I'm gonna come down and get you!
we'd better get up there.
let's get that boy!
sit here?
but I want to look, too.
a mini-Doris!
I didn't even know you could do that. It's so cute.
let's take her out for a spin.
sorry.
teamwork.
sorry.
sorry!
there you are.
now, to lure him out of the house.
I know! I'll blow it up! Yes! Yes, and... No.
no, that won't work. Then he'll be dead.
Oh! I know!
I'll turn him into a duck! Yes! Yes, it's so evil!
I don't know how to do that.
I don't really need a duck.
this may be harder than I thought.
Hey, ring my doorbell.
no, no, no, no, ring this doorbell.
that doorbell will give you a rash.
Yes! I'm two for two, man.
if they don't do it on purpose, it doesn't count.
come on. Read your rule book. - You know what?
you can take your rule book and shove it right...
I don't believe in fretting or grieving
why mess around with strife?
guess I was cut out to step out and strut out
give me the simple life
ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served.
dinner is served.
dinner is served.
Hooray! Italian food.
I want a sloppy joe!
Oh, Billie, could you please pass the gravy?
coming to you, big girl.
reminds me of the time my meatball pizza staved off civil war on the black moon of Keward.
Where's my sloppy joe?
thank you for the gravy, Aunt Billie.
we gotta talk. - How about some gravy? Over here.
why is the kid still here? Any of this ring a bell?
science fair, Memory Scanner, a time stream that needs fixing?
temporary setback.
he's just having a little confidence issue.
you want me to talk to him? - No.
I give a mean back rub. - No.
shiatsu? - No.
feng shui. - No.
I've got it under control.
so, Lewis, are you in Wilbur's class?
no. - Yes.
Yes. - No.
well, yes and no.
Lewis is a new transfer student.
Yeah.
where are you from, Lewis? - Canada?
I think you mean North Montana. Hasn't been called Canada in years.
do you know Sam Gundersen?
it's a big country. - State.
I wonder if you're related. - Maybe if he took his hat off.
Oh, good idea.
then we can see if he has the family cowlick.
he can't, because he's got bad hat-hair.
Oh, nonsense.
a North Montana man doesn't care about hat-hair.
let's see the cowlick!
all right, everyone, hold your horses.
Lewis, do you mind?
I'm afraid this isn't gonna stop otherwise.
but... But... - And so it begins.
now, don't be shy.
we're all family here. - Ready, aim, fire!
surely, that is not the best you can do.
impressive, little sister.
your skills are strong, but not strong enough.
your words do not threaten me, brother.
then enough words. Now the real battle begins.
your meatballs are useless against me.
then perhaps it's time for spicy Italian sausage!
No!
that's right. I did it.
is dinner like this every night?
no, yesterday, we had meatloaf.
okay, gang, time for the second course.
and what goes better with meatballs than P. B. and J?
Hey, that's just like...
stupid...
Carl?
is everything all right?
we're just experiencing bugs.
just what the doctor ordered.
my friend Lewis is an inventor. He can fix it.
Wilbur, you know I can't.
come on. Give it a try.
you don't understand what's at stake here.
uncle Joe's seen the toast!
we're past the point of no return!
if he doesn't get P. B. and J...
we all pay!
I don't know.
you would really be helping us out, Lewis.
please.
one dragonfly on the rocks, please, Mr Barkeep.
Hey, hey, Frankie, baby, you gotta tell us one of your jokes.
Yeah, Frankie. How about that one with the bullfrog?
all right, you bozos.
have to get that boy out of the house.
sorry. Wait!
so I turn to the bullfrog, and you know what I says?
talking frogs with their own little outdoor bar, and so smartly dressed! Perfect!
I says, "Hey, not with my umbrella, you don't."
Frankie, you're a riot. - I gotta go pee!
I love it. - You bunch of goons.
that's a good buzz. What the...
Yes! You are now under my control.
I am now under your control.
stop laughing. - Stop laughing.
don't repeat everything I say. - I won't repeat everything you say.
excellent. - Excellent.
did you just say, "Excellent," because I said, "Excellent"?
no.
excellent. - Excellent.
so, Mr Fix-it, how's it looking? - Pretty good, Mrs Robinson.
I've recalibrated the dispensing conduits and aligned the ejection mechanism and...
there he is, that repulsive, half-witted fool!
now, my slave, seize the boy.
bring him to me.
did you not hear what I said, you idiot? Grab the boy and bring him!
well, it's just that there's a million people over there, and I have little arms.
I'm just not so sure how well this plan was thought through.
master?
master?
okay, that should do it.
it's so exciting. Let her rip, Lewis!
quickly. Uncle Joe can't hold on much longer.
everybody ready?
go, Carl. - Yeah!
is it gonna work?
Oh, no!
No!
I didn't know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
you failed! - And it was awesome!
exceptional! - Outstanding!
I've seen better.
from failing, you learn. From success, not so much.
if I gave up every time I failed,
I never would have made the meatball cannon.
I never would have made my fireproof pants.
still working out the kinks.
like my husband always says...
keep moving Keep moving
stop
okay, talking frog, not a good minion.
need another henchman, something large, not too bright.
something that won't talk back.
what is he still doing here? Get rid of him.
Oh, my noggin.
Hey, what are you doing? Get your lousy mitts off of me!
you're gonna regret this!
wait! Wait! Don't move. That's it!
I wonder if I should tell Doris.
no, I'll make it a surprise.
all right, everyone, quiet down. Quiet down.
I propose a toast to Lewis and his brilliant failure.
may it lead to success in the future.
gosh, you're all so nice.
if I had a family, I...
I'd want them to be just like you.
Oh, well, then, to Lewis!
to Lewis!
to Lewis!
Yeah!
come on, Lewis! - Good show, buddy!
what if Louis Armstrong said, "I can't"?
you think he'd have walked on the moon?
dear, Louis Armstrong was a singer.
what did he mean, if he had a family?
Oh, Lewis is an orphan.
orphan?
Oh, no! - Big boy!
get up, you pansy!
what a great plan!
go back in time and steal a dinosaur. Oh, Doris will be so proud of me.
why didn't you tell me you had a pet dinosaur?
because we don't.
what are you talking about? He's standing right here.
Oh, no! No, you can't eat him!
I need him alive.
Choo-chew on this!
Lewis!
ready, aim, fire!
got you!
you messed with the wrong family!
Ding-dong! Pizza's here!
No!
okay, everybody, this dino's deep-dished.
run!
Oh! He ate Carl!
help us! Help! Help! - Oh, goodness!
Oh, no.
incoming!
run!
now, go get that boy!
what's going on?
why aren't you seizing the boy?
I have a big head and little arms.
I'm just not sure...
...how well this plan was thought through.
master?
stupid, stupid, stupid!
bowler Hat Guy!
him you can eat.
Lewis, run! - Wilbur!
No!
Oh, no!
little Doris now sleeps with the fishes.
nice catch. - Nice meatball shooting!
guess we made a pretty good team, huh?
Yeah, guess we did.
are you boys all right? - We're good, Mom.
Yeah, didn't you see us take out that dinosaur?
Oh, man! It was so cool, Mom!
Oh, I mean, I'm sorry. I didn't...
Oh, Lewis, it's okay.
I'm really happy you're safe.
your head. - What?
it's just a bruise, Lewis.
you all sacrificed so much for me.
well, of course. - You are a special kid.
one of a kind.
okay, you should get him out of here before something really bad happens.
silly, silly robot. I've got it all under control.
okay, everybody, it's been a long, hard day filled with emotional turmoil and dinosaur fights, so why don't you all hit the hay, and Lewis and me will get going?
do you have to go now? I mean, you know, it's getting late.
maybe Lewis could spend the night.
mom, maybe some other time, okay?
well, any time you want to come over, you just come over.
mom. - The truth is, we love having you.
we really have to go. - No.
no, you don't. You have to stay.
I mean, who would be a better family for you than us?
what do you say, Lewis?
do you want to be a Robinson?
you want to adopt me?
Yeah! - Yes!
okay, it's true. I'm from the past.
now you know the big secret.
Wilbur, what have you done? How could you bring him here?
that is an excellent question.
please, don't get mad at Wilbur.
he was just being a good friend.
Lewis, I am so sorry, but you have to go.
what? You just said...
I know what I said.
I'm from the past. So what?
Lewis. Lewis, look at me. You're...
you're a great kid, and we would never do anything to hurt you, but I'm sorry. You have to go back to your own time.
Yeah, about that, one of the time machines is broken, and the other one was stolen by a guy with a bowler hat, which kind of explains the dino.
I'm calling your father.
wait. If I have to leave, can I at least go back and find my mom?
wilbur promised.
you promised what?
I was never gonna do it. I swear!
you lied to me? - No!
Yes.
Lewis! Lewis, wait!
I can't believe I was dumb enough to actually believe you were my friend!
I am your friend!
mister, you're grounded till you die.
Oh, yes, Doris, it is a shame.
all he wants to do is go back in time to meet the mother he never knew, but they won't let him. We'd let him, though.
too bad we don't have a time machine.
Oh, wait. We do.
bowler Hat Guy?
Hello, Lewis. - What do you want?
to make your dream come true.
all you have to do is put Humpty Dumpty back together again, and we'll take you back to find your mommy.
Lewis!
let's just talk about this, Lewis. Come on!
I know you're around here somewhere.
Lewis!
I can't imagine why you're so interested in this piece of junk.
that's for me to know and you to find out.
now, show me how to work this thing.
it doesn't work. Never did.
well, supposing it did, and if one were presenting the invention to, say, a board of directors for a very large invention company, where might one find the "On" switch?
hypothetically speaking, of course.
all right, first, you turn this knob twice, then push this red button, and that's it. It's pretty easy.
what a stupid way to turn it on!
okay, take me to see my mom now.
Yes, of course.
Doris?
we had a deal!
Crossies! Doesn't count.
why are you doing this to me? I never did anything to you.
you still haven't figured it out?
figured out what?
well, let's see if this rings a bell.
father of the Future, inventor extraordinaire, "Keep moving forward"?
that's not me. That's Wilbur's dad.
are you saying that I'm Wilbur's dad?
give the boy a prize.
you grew up to be the founder of this wretched time, so I plan to destroy your destiny.
easy peasy, rice and cheesy. - Well...
so if I'm Wilbur's dad...
keep going.
if I'm Wilbur's dad...
Yes, thank you, we've established that.
but what does that have to do with you?
allow me to shed some light on the subject.
my old room!
I think you mean our old room.
what? - Yes! Yes, it is I,
Mike Yagoobian!
I know. I'm disgusting, but one learns to love it.
how did you end up like this?
well, it's a long and pitiful story about a young boy with a dream, a dream of winning a Little League championship, a dream that was ruined in the last inning.
we lost by one run because of me.
get him!
if I hadn't fallen asleep, I would have caught the ball!
and we would have won!
do you understand?
for some reason, no one wanted to adopt me.
whiz kid Cornelius Robinson graduates from college at age 14.
this year's Nobel Prize goes to a young Cornelius Robinson.
Hey, Goob, what's up? Cool binder.
Hey, Goob, wanna come over to my house today?
they all hated me.
eventually, they closed down the orphanage and everyone left, except me.
Cornelius Robinson rebuilds Inventco.
Robinson reaches out to... - It's new name, - Robinson Industries. - Cornelius Robinson!
Cornelius Robinson is now... - Now here's another amazing...
it was then that I realised it wasn't my fault.
it was yours.
if you hadn't kept me up all night working on your stupid project, then I wouldn't have missed the catch, so I devised a brilliant plan to get my revenge.
Robinson, you stink!
then, just as I was on the brink of destroying Robinson Industries,
I met her.
we retreated to our villainous lair, where Doris spun a tale of deception and woe.
apparently, you invented her to be a Helping Hat, a slave to humankind, but Doris knew she was capable of so much more.
however, you didn't see her true potential.
got it. - So you shut her down, or so you thought.
we both had a score to settle with you, and while my plan for revenge was brilliant, Doris' was...
well, we went with Doris', but I made a very, very important contribution.
together we made the perfect team.
Wilbur!
make sure you shut that door tight, or else the alarm won't engage.
Yeah, Mom.
I went to your house, snuck in the garage and stole the time machine, all thanks to that pointy-haired little kid who forgot to lock the garage door.
and now all that's left is to return to Inventco, where I'll pass off your little gizmo as my own.
but you have no idea what that could do to this future!
I don't care. I just want to ruin your life.
Goob, I had no idea.
shut up! And don't call me Goob!
how many evil villains do you know who can pull off a name like Goob?
look, I'm sorry your life turned out so bad, but don't blame me. You messed it up yourself.
you just focused on the bad stuff when all you had to do was let go of the past and keep moving forward.
let's see.
take responsibility for my own life or blame you.
"blame you" wins hands down!
this is gonna be the best day of my life!
Doris, would you be a dear and open the hatch for me, please?
No!
well, I hate to foil your evil plan and run, but ta-ta!
but...
I bet you're glad to see me.
that's for not locking the garage door.
you know about that?
I know everything.
you gotta admit, this will be a great story to tell me someday.
look at that, boys. We're almost home free.
Oh, no!
take a good look around, boys, because your future is about to change.
Lewis, you have to fix the time machine.
no. No, I can't.
what about your dad? You could call him.
you are my dad. - But that's in the future.
there won't be a future unless you fix the time machine.
look, I messed up.
I left the garage unlocked, and I've tried like crazy to fix things, but now it's up to you.
you can do it, Dad.
Lewis? Lewis! - Wilbur? Wilbur!
Wilbur.
Mrs Robinson? Uncle Art? Lefty?
prepare to be amazed.
I call it the Memory Scanner.
so, Yagoobian, any other ideas you'd like to share with us?
Yes. I call them Helping Hats.
they're everywhere!
Doris, what's happening? I don't understand.
I just wanted to ruin his future, not this.
No!
no. No, this can't be happening! No!
Oh, Lewis, it's already happened.
why did I ever invent that stupid hat?
take a good look around, Doris, 'cause your future's about to change.
Goob, stop!
you don't know what you're doing!
Yes, I do. I'm ruining your future.
she's using you, Goob, and when she gets what she wants, she'll get rid of you.
what? What?
I am never going to invent you.
come on, Goob. I've got to show you something.
Doris?
I thought she was my friend.
you did it, Lewis. You did it!
I'll hold him while you run for help.
let him go.
what are you doing? He's the bad guy.
no, he's not. He's my roommate.
what? - He's my old roommate, and I really think you guys should adopt him.
are you nuts? - Give me one good reason why not.
I'll give you three good reasons.
he stole our time machine, tried to ruin your future, and he smells like he hasn't showered in 30 years!
may I remind you, I'm your father, and you have to do what I say.
okay, Mr Yagoobian, do you want to be a...
Where'd he go? - Goob?
Goob!
Goob.
are you hurt? Any broken bones?
no, I'm... - Do you have a temperature?
brain fag? - Scurvy?
tapeworm? - Cellulite?
no. No, no, I'm fine. I feel fine.
in fact, better than I've felt in a long time.
Franny, they're gone. Oh, this is terrible!
Oh, boy. - Well, he's home early.
Franny, where are you? The time machines are gone!
ratted out by the old lady.
harsh.
okay.
Yeah, beats working in an office every day.
Yeah, no kidding.
Hey! Want to see the one I'm most proud of?
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no. That one.
it was our first real invention.
it's the one that started it all.
Wowie.
so if I go back now, then this will be my future.
well, that depends on you.
nothing is set in stone.
you gotta make the right choices and keep moving forward.
since it's gonna work this time, that means I...
we won't finally get to see what Mom looks like?
do we ever meet her?
I think you're just gonna have to get back to that science fair and find out for yourself.
I had a feeling you were gonna say that.
that's because we are one smart kid.
so long! - Bye-bye, Lewis!
farewell, future brother-in-law. - So long! See you later, Lewis!
Oh, don't forget the mashed potatoes!
have a safe trip, little Lewis. - I will.
Hey, while I got you here, just a couple of little suggestions regarding my design.
let's face it, these skinny limbs don't exactly make the teapot whistle.
all that really matters is, hey, don't forget to invent me.
are you kidding? No way! - I love you.
there's so many things I wish I could ask you.
excuse me. Time travel now, questions later.
but I... - Don't worry.
just get back to that science fair, and we'll see you real soon.
Oh, right. Right, okay, I will. Bye.
goodbye, son. - Thanks again for everything!
wait. Lewis, one more thing. - Yeah?
just a little tip for the future. I am always right.
even when I'm wrong, I'm right.
she's right. I'd just go with it if I were you.
and I am.
then you're absolutely right.
all right, I'm coming.
well, it's not like you're never gonna see them again.
they are your family, after all.
wait a minute.
you're supposed to take me back to the science fair.
I know.
well, I think you punched in the wrong numbers.
we agreed that, if you fixed the time machine,
I'd take you back to see your mom.
what?
a deal's a deal.
I don't get it. Why'd you just let her go?
because I already have a family.
I never thought my dad would be my best friend.
now, now, don't make me come and bail you out again.
I won't.
remember, I've got a time machine.
if you mess up again, I'll just keep coming back till you get it right.
you got that motto? - I got it.
don't forget it.
I don't think that's possible.
you better get going.
see you later, Wilbur.
wait a minute!
Goob! Goob, wake up!
what?
that's it!
mr Willerstein, I know what went wrong.
can I have one more chance? Please!
my ride isn't here yet, so fire it up.
I need a volunteer.
now, just give me a date to input.
well, now, let's see.
there's my first science fair, the day I got my first microscope, the time I swam the English Channel, my first gold medal for the luge.
I know.
perfect!
you look gorgeous. - He's a lucky guy.
Oh! It works.
it works! - It works.
you look beautiful, Lucille.
bud?
would you look at that? - Whoa!
honey! Honey, you're just in time.
Lucille! - You did it, Lewis! You did it!
this invention is brilliant!
kid, you're this fair's MVP!
that was some show you put on.
you're a real special kid, but you don't look like a Lewis. You look more like a...
Cornelius. I get that a lot.
Oh, no! Sorry, mister.
no harm done.
Frankie, what have I told you about running away?
Frankie? - My star pupil.
my name's Franny, and I teach frogs music.
Really?
you know that frogs have more musical ability than people?
but nobody believes me.
they all think I'm crazy.
you think I'm crazy, too.
no. No, I think you're right.
over here? There he is.
kid, we'd like to get a story on you for the local paper.
you've got a bright future ahead of you.
let it go
Yeah.
let it roll right off your shoulder
don't you know
the hardest part is over
let it in
let your clarity define you
in the end
we will only just remember how it feels
let it slide
let your troubles fall behind you
let it shine
until you feel it all around you
and I don't mind
if it's me you need to turn to
we'll get by
it's the heart that really matters In the end
our lives are made
in these small hours
these little wonders
these twists and turns of fate
time falls away
but these small hours
these small hours still remain
all of my regret
will wash away somehow
but I cannot forget
the way I feel right now
around here...

you got to cut that woman off at the pass 'fore she starts in.
Dwight, come on.
what?
was that just a line you used on me last night
about being my friend And not trying to fix everything in my life for me?
no, it wasn't a line.

Alex talking in riddles yet, driving you crazy?
she's a woman of depth, whitehead.
she's layered.
so how long you gonna give it this time around?
you're a sad old man with a dried-up heart.
tell Anne Marie I'm sorry for her.
your shirt's buttoned wrong, there, hotshot.
I really appreciate this, Dwight.
I know you guys are busy, but these two...
it's the fouris the bigger kidh we've had the instigator?
art Uh, you'd think, But, actually, little Scotty groves is just...
I assume things aren't good at home.
that turd head called me a liar!
cause you are one!
come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on, come on.
now, break it up. Break it up, here.
now, what was it --Mike?
let's just start from the beginning, here.
now, what happened?
he was bragging about his dad being in the FBI.
cause he is.
your daddy's FBI, Scotty?
see?
he's just a stupid old truck driver.
Mike, why don't you wait with, uh, principal Goodman?
you got to stop this fighting and lying, there, son.
it's a downhill, one-way street to nowheresville, is what it is.
you want to end up in the penitentiary, you little pigeon-chested thug?
Peni-what?
what's your daddy make Of all this brawling you're doing, Scotty?
all right, then how about me and Detective white go talk to him about it?
you can't.
why not?
terrorists kidnapped him last night.
buddy, everything's gonna be okay.
not if they don't let him go.
he's gonna miss my first baseball game.
you got yourself a real taste for the dramatics, don't you, son?
no, it's true!
the terrorists got him.
I heard bad yelling last night.
and I was gonna go get the gun under my brother's mattress and shoot them all, but I didn't.
and when I woke up for school today, my daddy wasn't there.
you want me to --to look into it?
Yes.
please.
Oh, hey, Murphy, how's your mama?
you guy
sergeant lightfoot, I beg your forgiveness.
I am late paying this ticket.
and please, please, please don't haul me away.
okay, Mrs. Hendricks, but you are gonna owe me in trade.
sergeant, you are a married man.
it's an open marriage, Mrs. Hendricks.
Mrs. Hendricks?
excuse me.
as in Dwight Hendricks' mother?
Yes.
I'm Tanya Rice, the new lieutenant.
Oh, are you?
Oh, I'm so pleased to meet you.
Oh, you know, Dwight has just told me bits and pieces, but he didn't tell me how gorgeous you are.
Oh, yes, you are.
the last lieutenant...
was not gorgeous.
well, now, you got to tell me something.
where did you get these cute little jeans?
w--oh, you don't think I'm trying to look too young?
Oh, pfft.
well, they're called "skinny jeans.
I don't know.
the girdle is built in.
goodbye, spanx.
I know!
why don't you come up to my office and have some sweet tea?
our air conditioner conked out.
Oh, aren't you nice?
you got a fridge up there now?
Oh, I have a microwave...
terrorists?
Scotty, we're gonna have to have a long talk about this.
now, I want you to go on upstairs, all right?
go on, sugar.
scoot.
Oh, I am so sorry Y'all had to come all the way out here.
can I get you a cold glass of water or something?
no. No, thank you.
looks like your boys get along.
Oh, yeah, they do...
until they don't.
Troy thinks Scotty's a real hoot, and he is.
he's not doing too well in school, though.
none of his teachers seem to see his potential.
boy, I do.
I just don't see how you can miss it.
Scotty, go on upstairs, honey.
Troy, did you say hi to the officers?
detectives.
detectives.
say hi to the detectives.
so, the story Scotty told us?
Oh, yeah, that was
last night, me and his dad, We were were arguing about our bank "terrorizing" us 'cause were late on a payment, And so they've been trying to foreclose.
so, your husband's okay, then, ma'am?
Cleo.
I hope so.
he's just working.
he's a truck driver.
he said he was going on a long cotton haul.
that's nothing.
it's just -- we have, uh, trouble with the wiring.
it'll come on.
Yeah, Billy
he's been taking up more work lately, and he was just gone bright and early this morning.
Oh, I...
all right, I think that's our cue.
all right, well, Thank you so much for bringing Scotty home safe.
and sorry for your trouble.
you should have your husband look at that wiring.
it --it ain't safe.
will do.
take care.
you notice the sick kid had resin stains on his fingers?
smokes pot.
hell, I did, too, when I was his age.
still would be if it weren't for body-hurling asthmatic attacks.
Alex sends me an e-mail, says, "don't read this if you're driving.
but it don't say nothin' else.
I'd say this is not about the words, my friend.
damn it.
she knows I use this thing for work.
she don't stop to think.
girl just acts.
she's a bohemian. That's what you get.
detective, you said you were gonna help.
look, son, just go inside and talk to your mama.
she'll explain.
she said you weren't gonna do nothin'.
you're the liar!
something's off , mom's a good woman,
claims dad's out hauling cotton, but she's nervous about something.
could be just the foreclosure, But I don't know.
that kid had a look in his eyes, you know?
he's too wound up for this to be nothing.
all right, get into it
see if you can get a location on this father.
will do.
your mother came in today.
we really hit it off.
you know we both belong to the curves out on Monroe?
how about that?
Hey, Dwight, your mama's boyfriend's downstairs.
Dwight! There you are.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry to barge in on you like this.
can we talk?
I'm working here, Tony.
well, ll walk with you, then, if that's okay.
look, uh, this is about what happened the other night.
Oh, the --the night I saw you up in the club With, what, your niece?
no. No.
it --it was exactly what it looked like.
I won't lie
that young thing had me eating out of the palm of her hand.
but all it means is I get to pick up the bar tab.
I know that.
you don't need to explain yourself to me, Tony.
well, I
lightfoot, your stepbrothers still grow cotton?
Yeah, and, uh, buckwheat and sunflowers.
they say diversity
cotton harvest happen yet?
Yeah, last weekend.
look, I want to level with you.
I just want to level with you.
I-I know I'm not for everybody, Dwight.
I know that.
but I really like your mom, and I think she likes me.
and beyond all that good southern upbringing, which I adore, I can see she's nobody's fool.
but you know what?
she listens to me.
and that's awfully important to a guy who likes to talk.
you know what I'm saying? - D. Greenback's looking for you.
well, so...
we're gonna see each other again, Dwight.
we already have.
what are you doing here, then?
well, I-I --I don't know.
I just thought maybe
mama can do whatever she wants.
but don't expect me to start playing tag football with you in the park on Sundays.
you get me?
Dwight, I checked on Billy groves.
dispatch said he was scheduled to work this morning but didn't.
what happened?
all they know is his rig broke down.
but that was yesterday morning.
Yeah, Billy brought that truck in for service yesterday, about 7: 00 A. M.
what happened when Billy left?
somebody pick him up?
well, he started out walking, Got a bit up the road, and then, yeah, he got picked up.
okay. By who?
what kind of car was it?
town car
older model, maybe '87, midnight blue.
who was driving?
had a black guy driving and a white boy riding shotgun.
anything else about these guys?
seem like friends of his?
I don't know.
you got friends beat the living hell out of you, toss you in a car, and then peel out?
can I go back to work now?
no.
are you telling me that you see someonget beat up,
tossed in the back of a car, and you don't even call the police?
look, I got my own golden rule
you do for others what they do for you.
all Billy ever did for me was be a cheap prick.
I guess the kid was on to something, after all.
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I was still hoping that Billy would turn up this morning And that this whole nightmare would be over.
I don't know what he's tangled up in.
but he can't be gone.
my boys need their daddy.
so, truth now
when's the last time you saw him?
last night.
these two guys drove him home.
you know who these two guys were?
I never seen them before.
they were outside for a while, and they were yelling at him.
What'd they look like?
one was black and bald and kind of young, maybe 30.
and the other was white, and he looked like he lifted weights a lot.
what about the car?
it was big, a four-door, blue.
so they drove up, yelled. What next?
well, Billy came inside, and he had a big cut over his eye.
and I started in on him about the bank, and that's what Scotty heard.
and then he said,"I'm going out with those guys, and I'll be back soon.
and then he, uh...
he didn't come back.
so, he'd been up to something to make up the money you owed the bank?
honey, you got to tell us everything
what he was into, who he owed, all of it.
Cleo, we don't find him quick, you may never see him again.
he said the less I know about what he's doing, the better.
how was he acting the last few days?
he was on the phone a lot to, uh, somebody named Flynn.
but that could be anybody, you know, about anything.
the guys outside, They were calling him "scarecrow," though.
and I thought that was weird.
Oh, no.
sorry.
can we talk somewhere?
sorry, Dwight, but I got something here,
and I figure it's better we talk out of earshot, so as not to worry the missus.
well, you might want to drop the "oh, no" next time.
that's a good point.
so?
I think Billy's a straw buyer.
what?
that's a middleman who buys firearms from a gun shop
and then turns around and sells those guns to felons.
I know what a straw buyer is, Sutton.
I mean why do you think that
cause those guys were calling him "scarecrow"?
Yeah.
and you throw in the name "Flynn,
which likely stands for Marty Flynn over at goose's guns, where...
I got a V I.P. pass, and I think we got something here.
selling guns can be a dangerous business.
kind of thing could get you kidnapped.
Hey, what goes on beyond these doors, even in the parking lot,
not something can be blamed on me.
all right, then.
so you won't blame us when we start doing surveillance In that parking lot every night.
now, look, Flynn, you're gonna cough up names, and you're gonna cough them up now.
Flynn, we got all day.
fine.
have a look around.
see something you like, give me a holler.
I've said all I'm gonna.
Ah, heck with it.
we're here.
let me see them six-shooters.
they look pretty sweet.
these here are my pride and joy.
you ever see the movie, uh, The Good, the Bad And the Ugly?
W-what -- what are you doing?
Hey, cut that out.
what are you doing to my guns?
come on, man. Don't do that.
don't mess with my guns.
Oh, man. Always wanted to do that.
that's one heck of a gun.
so, who was Billy selling guns to?
how about Dirty Harry?
you seen those movies?
should see what I can do with a . 44.
fine. Billy was doing business outside,
working out of the back of his caprice.
but y'all are barking up the wrong tree.
Billy's been out of the gun game for months.
what game was he working?
cause something got him kidnapped.
all I know is the last time I saw him,
he said some crap about, "I'm moving on to greener pastures, Flynn.
Thanks, Flynn.
greener pastures" could be money laundering.
or lawn maintenance, maybe.
no, Billy was growing weed.
explains the resin on the kid's hands,
why the power kept going out at their house.
takes a lot of juice to power those grow lamps.
I'll call lightfoot, get the dogs.
what the hell?
we were fighting for the gun, and it just went off.
and I shot him.
okay, back up, Cleo.
take us back to Billy coming in that night.
well, he came in.
he was bloody from fighting with those two guys,
and he was in a real dark mood, And I knew where it was going.
so I finally said to him,"I'm leaving.
I'm gonna take the boys, and I'm leaving.
then what happened?
he pulled out his gun, and he pointed it at me.
he'd done the gun bit before.
but he seemed different this time
madder, maybe,'cause he got beat up.
I don't know.
or maybe I was different.
I don't know.
and did the kids come into the room?
no. No, no. They were upstairs.
well, Scotty was upstairs. And then Troy come downstairs.
Troy got involved?
no, no, he didn't get
he was-- came in toward the end of it,
when we were still struggling with the gun.
keep going.
I'm sorry.
I should've went to the police, I know.
I'm sorry. I just panicked.
I didn't know what to do.
and I wanted this all to be over with.
but that's when Troy spilled it about the pot in the shed out back.
you're telling us you had no idea about the pot out back?
no. Billy kept it hidden.
and he told me not to go near his stuff.
but the boy was in on it?
Troy listened to his daddy. We all did.
Where's the gun, Cleo?
in the Mississippi.
so you covered up a crime scene, buried a body,
drove all the way to South Memphis In the middle of the night to throw the gun in the River,
and you still made it back in time to send your boy to school?
Yeah. It was adrenaline, I guess.
Where's Troy?
he went out in the truck soon as y'all brought the dogs.
he took the gun from under his mattress.
answer the phone, Cleo.
Troy was protecting me!
he saved my life! Please!
you don't know how Billy treated us!
he's just a kid!
answer it.
Hello?
baby, where are you?
are you all right?
I want you to just stay put, okay, and don't do anything.
we're gonna figure this out.
Cleo, where is he?
kid's inside. He's armed.
I ran into your mama this morning over at curves.
we got to talking.
I was telling her about Rodney, my youngest.
he is wise beyond his years.
but when I decided to go back to my faith,
Rodney did not support me.
I found myself in church, But not really able to be in church.
know what I'm talking about, Dwight?
but Rodney, being wise, he
he put hisself aside,
and now he accompanies me every Sunday.
he backs my joy, Dwight.
think about it.
positions, people! I'm going in!
Troy? I'm lieutenant rice.
you okay?
I'm not armed.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
put the gun down.
no. No way.
let's talk about what happened the other night.
it was an accident. - I believe you.
no, you don't. You're just saying that.
nobody's ever gonna believe me,
so I'm not gonna waste my breath, okay?
okay.
then tell me something else.
why'd you come to this place?
I don't know.
Oh, you're smarter than that, Troy.
out of all the places you could've gone, you picked this one.
I'm just interested to know why.
I figured I'd have fun for the last time in my life.
all right? But it sucks,'cause the electricity don't work.
Yeah.
he beat the hell out of her!
all the time!
and me, too! And Scotty!
and when she tried to protect us, he'd just go worse at her,
say he was gonna kill her if she told anybody.
I hate him!
and I am not going to jail for him!
all right? I'm not!
Troy, put the gun down on the ground right now.
No!
fine.
but I'm coming closer.
I'm coming closer so we can talk better.
let's talk about your father.
I know you have had a hard time lately.
I never had it hard like you.
my daddy was a great daddy.
he was tough as hell on me, but -- strict.
he never even let me go on a date till my 18th birthday.
Really? - Even then, I couldn't go by myself.
what about the guy you were dating?
that had to make him feel like a chump.
okay, he was a chump.
he never opened a door for me.
you open the door for your girlfriend?
Yeah, I do.
my mom said I got to do it for her and for all ladies.
your mama is a wise lady.
Yeah.
man, I hate him so much.
Troy, come on. Pull yourself together.
I believe you when you say what happened was an accident.
I came down from my room.
my dad was all beat up and scaring my mom.
so I went to the closet where we keep the colt,
and I held it up at him...
thinking I'd scare him.
but we started tussling over it,
and he swung me across the room, and it went off.
all right, but it was an accident.
okay.
come on. Come over here.
come here.
you're a good man.
I'll call your mama.
and I'm gonna be down at the station by the time you get there. Don't worry.
watch your head, darling.
it's gonna be all right.
straight towards that barrel, she walked.
what?
kid said he got the colt out of the closet, - Where it was kept. - Correct.
Scotty said Troy keeps the gun under his mattress.
said it twice.
so Troy lied about where the gun was kept. Why?
maybe it changes how it looks.
maybe it wasn't such an accident.
maybe there's a bunch more lies where this one's coming from.
sort it out, detectives.
I brought you something.
Hey, a new glove. Thanks.
needs some breaking in to be perfect.
Yeah.
thank you for bringing him back.
Cleo, we thought it would be a good thing If we went over that night.
you can show us exactly what happened. All right?
all right.
Troy, why don't you stand where you stood that night
when you first came down?
and where were you?
I was right here in the kitchen.
you be the dad. Be the dad. Get me?
all right, where was Billy?
he came in through here.
and he was just yelling at me, and I was talking back.
and I turned away from him, but then he was pointing at me.
he started yelling in my face.
and then he grabbed me.
and I was here and saw them fighting.
so I went to the closet...
and he pushed me.
I grabbed the gun.
and, uh, my dad grabs it.
and, uh, we tussle over it.
then he pushes me.
Agun was in my hand, ere and it went off.
all right, let's do it again.
okay. - You were here.
Billy came in.
he came in, we argued, and...
you come in. You go to the closet, get the gun, struggle with the gun.
hits the wall. Gun goes off.
all right. All right, let's do it one more time. Come on.
you come down.
you go to the closet.
you get the gun. Faster, faster.
come on. Come on.
shakes her.
one more time.
all right, come on.
show me. In her face, pointing, shaking her.
you come down. You see it. Push her.
where were you going, Troy?
you going upstairs to get your gun?
no. I forgot that I stopped on the steps.
you stopped right there that night? - Yeah.
or you stopped right there, right now,
because you've been lying to me
and you were going upstairs to get your gun that night.
no, I stopped that night 'cause he was laughing.
who? - Dad. He said he found it.
he knew the gun was under my mattress.
so where did I think I was running to?
so if I thought I was gonna be some hotshot hero for my mom,
I was wrong, and that the gun wasn't there no more.
then what happened?
I knew he must have put it back in the closet,
so, like before, I beat him down the hallway, grabbed it,
and then, you know, all the rest.
okay, let's -- - Wait a second, wait a second.
what is this?
what? Nothing. - I didn't
did he do that to you?
no, this -- this is from my curling iron the other day.
he didn't punch me. It's just a burn.
all right, well, I guess we're done here.
nice, huh? - Oh, Dwight, I am floored.
this is -- this is c'est bon.
what do you think, Paul?
Oh, Dwight, I can't believe you did this.
I just love all the candles.
did you just call her "Paul"?
don't you love that, Dwight?
I've never had a nickname.
it's magnifique.
en fran? ais. - En fran? ais.
Dwight, did you know that Tony lived in Paris?
no, I didn't know that.
Oh, he's been all over the globe.
he's just accomplished so much.
no kiddin'.
so, uh, d-does mama
I'm sorry, does Paul ever tell you about my dad?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
it sounds like we could've been good friends.
Dwight -- - Did she tell you he won the, uh, mpd medal of valor?
how about we talk about me?
let's go there.
let's take that trip.
enough about me. What do you think of me?
Paula Ann, what are your prospects for getting to Paris?
Oh, slim to none.
the gypsies -- they leave you on the doorstep.
and sometimes I begin to believe her.
sounds good enough to me.
your eyes are just...
so the mayor says to my dad -- and I'll never forget this
he said,"I've known a lot of brilliant men in my life, But you, sir
you look lovely in coral.
thank you.
now, some guys have issues with doing housework, But...
not him.
I've only been to Paris by way of the travel channel.
and "gee-gee. - " "Gigi.
Oh, Gigi"? - Yeah, that's how you pronounce it.
Oh, do they? Is it just like that?
Yeah, it's very, very sexy.
Oh, my golly.
just like you tonight.
I can't imagine how Memphis is holding a man like you.
it's not Memphis. It's you.
I might draw some comparisons, too.
well, I can't wait to take you.
as long as you're able, you know?
Yeah.
well, here's to edelweiss.
here's to edel-- oh, my goodness.
sorry, I got to go.
cut, cut, cut, cut. Sorry.
forgot to turn this thing off. Let's, uh -- let's take -- take five.
Hello?
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm in the middle of a dress rehearsal. Why?
bon appétit. The mom did it.
okay, Dwight. Tell me a tale.
we saw a burn mark on Cleo's cheek.
it was covered with makeup.
she says it's from a hot curling iron.
done that. Got a couple of scars around my ears to prove it.
hot Shell casing can do the same thing if you're left-handed Pulling the trigger on a right-handed gun, 'cause the casings eject to the right side, Can burn your cheek.
do we know that she's left-handed? - She is.
how? Based on what that kid said?
cause I saw her sewing.
night in question, Troy did run upstairs,
get his gun from under the bed,
and here's why he's been lying.
he gave it right to his mama.
kid's a minor. He's only 15.
if Cleo did it and Troy takes the fall,
they're thinkin' nine months in juvie.
he's home to graduate High School.
whereas Cleo could face a life sentence.
and Scotty'd grow up without a mama around.
we need a confession.
you can't do this to your son.
we know you killed Billy.
what are you talking about?
I don't know what the detectives are telling you,
but that's not what's happened at all.
I'll tell you what they're thinking, 'cause I just talked to them.
and they're watching us now.
trading eight or nine months of your son's life
it's not easy,
but it's a small price to pay
for you to avoid a life in prison.
now, the men around here are not good at math,
but they surely view that As a rotten, selfish thing to do.
Oh, but you don't,'cause we're both women,
and so those men are just judging me too harsh, Is that it?
no, they just don't understand why you're doing it.
Cleo, I understand why you're doing this.
I'm a mother of five.
I would do the same thing...
if I knew there was a guarantee.
what guarantee?
that's the wrinkle. There is none.
you know, Troy may not be tried as a juvenile like you think.
what are you talking about? He's just 15.
15-year-old boys charged with murder Can Ando go to prison.
it's at the discretion of the judge.
you're gambling, Cleo.
are you sure that's what you want for Troy?
he did it.
he did it.
and that's what happened.
you could be tried as an adult for this.
depend on the judge, but you could go to prison.
we told your mom about this, too,
and you know what she said?
same thing she's been saying -- That you did it.
your mama loves you. She's a good mama.
but she can't ask you to take a risk like this.
Hey, she didn't ask me to do a thing.
people forget, I got a brain, too.
and I know what I'm doing.
even knowing you could be losing years of your life
for something you didn't do?
maybe it'll change things for me... Which sucks.
but any which way, My little brother's gonna be okay.
I could go at Cleo again.
she's conflicted.
boy needs his mama.
bring Cleo.
Hey, Scotty.
how's it going?
good. - Good.
like my glove? - Love it.
I got one just like that at home.
you do? - Yeah.
it's brown and black, too, just like that.
Hi, honey.
we're gonna get you home, okay? - Okay.
Oh, Dwight! - Morning, mama.
Oh, morning.
hope you two worked up an appetite.
I love you. - Love you, too.
talk.
Hello? Where are you?
are you sleeping? Wake up, sleepy man.
Hey, I was thinking about making you dinner.
we could eat outside under the stars with the bugs.
Ohh, but wait, let's do it late,'cause I got to go to dmv.
stupid registration expired.
are they even open on weekends?
ugh -- oh, shoot.
my pancakes are on fire.
Dwight, I got -- oh, I got to go. I'm sorry.
okay. I want to see you. I miss you. Goodbye.
excuse me. I am Lt. Tanya Rice, MPD.
um, you'll have to join the line.
you know what?
I truly wish I could join the line,
but there is...
a murder I need to attend to with much haste.
account number?
Yep, there's my little card.
somebody's hacked into my account...
or there's been a terrible mistake.
I went online this morning And almost lost my mind when I saw...
$20, 000 withdrawn two days ago.
I see it.
Yes. Yes.
so, how long before you all replace the funds?
theft is covered, I do know that.
huh. "huh" what?
O-Kay.
no, you know what? I get to look.
that's my account. No, ma'am.
um...I'm not sure this is classified as a theft.
actually, this is a transfer.
Yeah, since it's a co-signer on the account... Carl Rice.
looks like he transferred it into his personal account.
I mean, you do know him, right?
Oh, no, no, no, no. Uh, we're divorced.
he's not on that account.
he took my money?
Oh, Carl Rice? You have proof of that?
because he is not on the account.
I do. And he still is.
but I could call Mr. Rice and just let him know...
do not call him!
not on good terms?
listen to me.
my ex-husband will not put that money back.
he will spend that money like he's suckin' up oxygen Unless you revoke the funds,
put them back into my account, where they belong.
and you can do that... Marissa.
you know you can.
that's my son's college money.
Rodney... he needs that for his future, okay?
come on.
that's my girl.
is the money still there in his account?
I'm sorry.
I just can't do this. It's just not...
Yes, you can. Here, let me see this.
Oh, no, I'm sorry. You can't touch my equipment. Let...
I'm the customer. Ma'am, ma'am... You stop it. stop it.
you do not touch my account. Please let go. Just stop, ma'am!
you let go!
stop, ma'am. No, no! You stop!
stand down, Marissa. No, you stand down!
security! Security!
calm down, everybody.
nothin' to see here.
Oh, do not even think about it.
this is the last damn time I take lunch three hours late, I can promise you that.
it's your favorite place, whitehead. Stop complaining.
now I won't be hungry for dinner till around midnight,
and that's a guaranteed recipe for reflux.
I been seeing this shaman, and what I can tell about you, 'cause of all your anger, whitehead, Is you got to stop eating such heavy meals.
the human body cannot only survive but thrive on just two gallons of water a day.
it's an ancient Amachauca water diet.
I been doing it a week myself, and look at me...
I've never been happier and have been pissing clear all day long.
we don't need to hear about the color of your damn urine, Sutton, okay?
and there ain't nothing wrong with the way I eat.
all units, cover code 4-1-7.
corner of Mosby and Manassas.
don't even think about it. No, no, no.
that's 4-1-7. That's "man with a gun." we got to go.
five minutes, okay? Lateefah will make me a to-go platter.
rather a man with a gun run rampant in a crowded city
or eat your lunch, whitehead?
well, I-I would like to...
Ah, damn it!
Memphis police department. Who saw what happened here?
I did. Skinny white man in a tie goes knockin' on that door.
old man answers the door with a gun.
points it straight at him.
marches his bony white ass right inside And then slammed the door.
and I was like, "I know I just did not see that.
when did this happen?
about 15 minutes ago.
what's his name, the old man with the gun?
keeps to himself, but he been here forever.
one time I heard him yell at the mailman.
now, don't be talkin' tales like that about that old man.
he's a sweet old man.
damn. That was close.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
who? The old man.
are you crazy? We just call s. W.A. T.
no time. Clock's ticking.
that hostage is in danger.
cover me, whitehead.
you hardheaded son of a bitch!
you have no respect for my life!
I'm older than you, buckaroo!
I don't like to take chances! I already did that already!
what the hell?
you lookin' to die today?
my name is Dwight Hendricks.
I'm a Detective with the Memphis police department.
just wondering if I can ask you what all this is about.
you all know what it's about!
so don't start pretendin' that you don't!
who do you got in there with you?
damn well know who he is!
all right. Okay.
it's... it's gonna be all right.
I sure would be grateful If you'd lower that gun just a notch.
thank you.
what's your name, sir?
you better back the hell off!
you better back off now!
if not, this boy in here is gonna die!
I mean it! You hear me?!
I'll kill him! You back off!
okay, I'll go talk to them.
everything's gonna be fine. We're gonna work this out.
as long as you don't do anything reckless.
we understand each other? Yeah.
we understand each other.
I'm gonna talk to them.
I know you.
damn... It really is you.
you mind if I... can I come in?
we got to go in, too.
you don't know what you're talking about.
I know that there are moments that define a man's character.
and what Dwight just did... that's one.
and you and me sitting here, biding our time, fear ruling our...
Oh, I felt that. I felt that.
it was a car door, Sutton.
rice! This is bullshit.
Hello, Hudson.
hostage situation is our territory.
what's your rogue cop doing in here?
rogue cop? Are you kidding me?
my Detective put himself at great personal risk to defuse a volatile situation.
I trust his instincts.
does he have extensive training in hostage crisis? No.
my squad and I will now devise an assault protocol that we will carry out.
and we will keep you apprised.
he's your partner. You should've stopped him.
look, white, this is a bad day.
it's a bad, bad day.
how come you know me?
that gun... put it down.
I know that you're Sebastian Lagrange,
one of the greatest Memphis session musicians of all time.
it's an honor to meet you. I'm a fan.
I got all those records...
when I was a kid, I'd pore over those liner notes,
memorized all those old session pictures.
I can see that you're in some trouble here.
and I just want to help you out,
make sure things don't get any worse.
I'm worried about this man in this kind of heat.
you mind if I give him some water?
Yeah, it's all right.
but I'm done pickin' beans.
I'm too old.
I ain't goin' nowhere with him.
What'd this man do to you, make you want to tie him up like this?
it's between me and him.
but he ain't goin' nowhere.
please... I'm Jeffrey. I'm Jeffrey MC...
shut up!
put that tape back on his mouth.
you the devil, uh-huh.
you want to take me back... to Leadbelly's crib.
none of the neighbors know his name,
and the database only lists the homeowner as bluff city savings and loan.
no idea who this guy is.
you all right in there?
Dwight? Yeah.
H-hang on. Rice is here.
Dwight, you need to get the hell out of there.
s. W.A. T.'s here. Let them take it over.
no, you can't let s. W.A. T. In here.
this guy's Sebastian Lagrange.
he's a livin' legend, and he's an old man.
if s. W.A. T. Comes in here, they'll kill him.
Dwight, get your...
listen to me.
he said "Leadbelly's crib.
Leadbelly... the... the blues musician spent some time in prison for murder in the 1930s at Angola.
Sebastian talks about growing beans, which is something they do there.
seems to think he was at Angola prison farm.
who is the hostage?
I'm not sure, but Sebastian seems to think he's here to take him back to Angola.
guy's not armed. Doesn't feel like a cop.
white male. First name "Jeffrey.
last name begins capital "m," small "c.
5'9," 160. Light-brown hair, brown eyes.
we'll find out.
all right, and see if Sebastian has any family nearby, could come down, help soothe the...
get out here!
you ain't done yet?
we're live on channel 6 in orange mound.
hero cop, crazed gunman...
now three lives hanging in the balance.
let's find out some more information.
officer, what can you tell us?
I can tell you what danger smells like...
fresh gunpowder in the air.
let me, if I may, Walk you through the last hour and a half,
from the inside perspective...
must feel like you've done enough with your life, Sebastian...
having made all the legendary music you have.
though, bein' a bluesman, probably ain't no time for feeling satisfied.
you still got things left to say.
ain't that right?
yeah... I got more stories.
and you want to tell 'em.
let me help you end this.
it's the police!
they gonna land on the roof, come in the windows!
well, I ain't goin' with them! We all gonna die here!
Hey, hey! Sebastian!
police choppers... they circle.
this one's just hovering there.
you hear it?
just calm down, please.
it's just a news chopper.
all right? Let me show you.
that's my house.
all them people lookin' on.
lot of folks in your corner wanting to see this thing end nice and peaceful.
a-any other stations?
we're fortunate that our man on the inside Is my close friend Detective Dwight Hendricks.
let me give you some background on the man.
Memphis 1972.
Dwight was born... excuse me, officer.
you have a woman in plain clothes Just arrived here at your command post.
what can you tell me about her?
probably just an FBI profiler arrived here to analyze their stats.
that's Shirley.
you know her?
that's my daughter.
my dad, he's, uh...
he's holding someone at gunpoint?
Yes, ma'am, and we were hoping that you would talk to him.
I...
I-I don't know.
I-I-I'm sorry, But we haven't seen each other in 12 years.
haven't even spoken, not a word.
I wouldn't want to upset him even more.
uh, excuse me.
what do you got?
I I. D.'d your hostage... Jeffrey McManus.
man ain't got nothing to do with Angola.
he's a process server, Dwight.
Sebastian is being evicted.
all right.
so he comes to the door, Sebastian sees the papers,
thinks he's a cop trying to take him back to Angola.
Yeah, but the thing is, Sebastian Lagrange has never served time in prison.
he's delusional.
which is why you cannot get inside his head, Dwight.
got to try.
what?
Hey, I found a number stamped on the back of a family picture.
it's a five-digit number.
I'm thinking maybe it's a prison I. D. Number or something.
run it. It's 24601.
I need you to run 24601... combined penal database.
got it.
uh, we got it.
Leroy Hitch. Convicted of murder in 1963, age 19.
victim was Emily Darlene Clay, Age 18, Caucasian.
Leroy hitch was sentenced to life, no parole.
escaped six years later... From Angola prison farm.
he's African-American, 5'10," 180.
that's him.
listen, Dwight. Take him down.
how come you keep goin' into the bathroom?
I'm, uh... I'm on a water diet.
shaman prescribed it.
that's the craziest crap I ever heard.
who's Leroy hitch?
there's an escaped murderer in my father's house?
Leroy hitch is your father.
what?
no.
hell no! You will not be put with my man still inside!
acting rashly could get him killed, Hudson.
what'll get him killed Is an escaped murderer with a loaded firearm.
you got 45 minutes.
tear gas?
it's not gonna come to that. Don't worry.
my father is not a murderer.
this is some horrible mistake. Some kind of mistaken identity.
this is crazy. My mother would never have loved someone...
she might not have known.
Oh, my God.
that's why he couldn't come to my wedding.
that's the reason we stopped talking 12 years ago.
where was the ceremony?
new Orleans.
he couldn't go back to Louisiana.
so, we're here 'cause you don't think You deserve to serve that sentence at Angola.
that right, Leroy?
they'll cut you a break 'cause you're older.
you'll do a few years.
and die at the farm.
no.
I didn't do no crime.
it's plain and simple.
so tell me what happened.
i-it was Christmas eve.
I had a present for Emily.
I wrote her a song.
couldn't afford to buy her nothin'.
Emily your girlfriend?
white girl.
must've been...
controversial in a place like Arden.
we fell in love.
and nobody knew about it, except her sister.
we would talk...
about goin' to Chicago, you know...
where we could be free.
so, how's this get pinned on you?
it was Christmas eve.
and I snuck...
in the back door...
of Emily's house.
I was the one...
who found her.
they gave me life... In Angola.
I filled out my appeals in pencil.
they wouldn't give me no lawyer.
they was all turned down.
so, what could I do?
after I escaped...
I came here.
I played my music, went to church, and didn't cause nobody no trouble.
and then...
this man.
he come knockin' at my front door And wants to take me back to Angola.
wouldn't even...
wouldn't even let me die in peace.
he ain't from Angola.
he was here with eviction papers.
you don't know that!
I...
would never...Hurt her.
ever.
Leroy, that song you wrote for Emily.
you remember it?
the man who wrote that beautiful song did not kill the woman he wrote it for.
no, I did not.
let's end this.
just put the gun down, let the man go,
and I'll make sure you're treated fair.
that's a promise, Leroy.
they ain't gonna believe I'm innocent.
I'll go and prove it. It's my line of work.
the only way I'm getting him out of this house peaceful Is if he thinks he ain't going back to Angola.
I need you to send whitehead to Louisiana, look into this case.
if there's anything, any ray of hope,
I can get him to walk out of here.
did he shoot you in the heart, Hendricks?
cause you're definitely bleeding.
detective white, get your car keys.
Sutton! Go with him to Louisiana.
and don't let him be textin while he driving.
sure thing. Wait a minute!
I was supposed to stay on my diet for four extra days To clear out all the toxins.
but you can't go on a road trip without snacks.
pit stop at circle k! What-what!
Emily Clay case box. 1958.
thank you, chief.
I just need to look into some loose ends here.
Why? 'cause we're a redneck outfit who framed an innocent black man?
no, because my partner's being held at gunpoint by a man who thinks he's being framed for this crime.
there's no fingerprint results from the murder weapon.
they never ran the knife for prints.
maybe they thought they had their guy in Hitch and didn't bother... no offense.
I'll run 'em.
it's worth a try.
detective white.
I just got the fingerprint results.
but you're not gonna like it.
one set of latents on the knife. Leroy Hitch.
his alone.
okay.
murder weapon has your fingerprints on it, why? You said you were innocent.
don't know.
you sit down!
you sit down. I'm trying to help you out here, damn it.
now stop lying to me.
why are your prints on the damn knife?
I don't know. It was all a blur.
you remember that song like yesterday.
how come this a blur?
I-I-I-n my mind, I-it all got mixed up.
them damn cops... they had me in a box for 29 hours!
no food! No water! No sleep!
T-t-t-they... they painted pictures, a-and they described like... like how I did the murder.
T-t-they went on and on and on!
and then...
I could see it.
I could see it.
and then they let me have some sleep.
when I woke up, it... it... it was like a-a dream.
and I said, "I didn't kill nobody.
they said, "oh, no. Y-you done confessed, Leroy.
like you said...
why would I write a song for Emily and then kill her?
sure, you loved her.
but you could have written that thing right here, right now,
and I know that. No!
cause I played it for her baby sister the day before.
I wanted to see if it was good enough.
you go ask her.
please.
you go ask her.
okay.
I will. I promise.
now, let's just...
I didn't mean to shoot. It just went off.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna call my lieutenant, let her know we're okay.
we're coming out.
on the ground! On the ground! On the ground!
don't move!
take it easy.
we have the suspect in custody.
you get yourself some sleep,
or you up all night writing your movie pitch?
sorry I couldn't help your guy down in Louisiana.
I know he means something to you.
where is he, whitehead?
Where's Hitch? He ain't downstairs in the holding cells.
louisiana wanted him back.
they asked us to waive jurisdiction on everything that happened last night.
I had to send him back.
Shirley spent the morning with him downstairs, mending fences.
it's a silver lining of some sort.
the man did the crime.
he got 48 years of freedom he was not entitled to.
that ain't necessarily true.
and I promised him I'd look into it.
you need to grow a thicker skin, or this job's gonna kill you.
do you know the heart-attack rate at MPD?
ulcers?
all right.
put me down for a couple of personal days.
I hate Louisiana. I hate the humidity.
but ocasionally you are onto something, Detective.
glad you're here lieutenant.
Memphis p. D.
y'all been watching too many cold-case programs.
well, we sure do appreciate your indulgence, chief.
I mu say that I don't think I could have handled it Asiplomacally as you have.
well, if it hadn't have been for you and your good graces,
I'm not so sure we'd have found this box a second time.
M. E. Report says that there was a struggle.
head-and-neck wounds.
and then Emily was stabbed six times in the chest.
Yeah, with a, ... 1954 wenger swiss army knife.
sold at every army/nav. in the country.
so that don't help.
a snow globe?
that's beautiful.
a crack in the crystal. Why's this in the box?
murderer brought that to the house that night.
Emily had a snow-globe collection,
but, uh, family verified it wasn't one of hers.
Leroy said he brought it with him.
no, snow globe wasn't his present.
Leroy didn't have money for a gift.
worked up a song for her instead.
keep the box handy. We'll be back.
thank you, chief.
finally, you caught Leroy after all these years.
Ooh, it makes me want to shiver a bit.
now he'll finally pay for what he did to my sister.
Miranda, that's also why we are down here.
during Leroy's capture,
we learned some about your sister's case, thought we'd take a second look.
I don't understand.
well, Leroy told me about a song he had written for Emily.
said he played it for you first.
was a very romantic song.
now, when you were with him, did Leroy talk about Also giving Emily a snow globe for Christmas?
Oh, no. Made a point of having no money for such things.
so, who else might've come by you-all's house With a snow globe that night?
I-I don't know.
did you ever tell anybody else about your sister's involvement with Leroy?
Um...I-I don't think so. I don't remember.
Oh, but the snow globe...
he was Emily's boyfriend before Leroy.
he knew that she liked snow globes.
but, um, no, he... he wasn't around that night.
did this Brian know about Leroy?
no.
you see, um, they broke up when Brian went off to college.
he never forgave himself.
he... he said if he'd have known that Emily was at such risk datin' Leroy,
he would have rushed right back home, talked some sense into her.
not my sentiments, ma'am.
so this Brian still had a thing for Emily after they broke up.
well, he's just a protective gentleman type, generally.
this guy wasn't in the case box.
does he still live around here?
does he ever.
prominent family. Been here for generations.
in fact...
he's our mayor.
so, how can I be...on service???
we wanted to talk About the murder of Emily Clay.
well...
most devastating moment of my life...
getting the news that Christmas eve.
but I'm curious.
after all these years later, why is this a police matter...
a Memphis police matter?
the man convicted of murdering her...
he escaped in 1965 from Angola... I'm aware of that.
and was arrested last night in Memphis.
he's being sent back to Louisiana, back to Angola.
well, that is indeed good news. Finally some closure.
or not. Hitch might be innocent.
he tell you that?
persecuted because of his race?
you saying that didn't happen 50 years ago in the South?
I'm saying that it did happen,
which is why I volunteered in '61 To help the freedom riders
and, in '62, to help register black voters...
but even I got to tell you guys something.
that jury of his peers that convicted Leroy Hitch...
they got it right.
I'm sorry.
could you excuse me just a minute here?
sorry.
what could I say?
chewing tobacco... lifelong habit.
so, Emily was your girlfriend throughout High School?
grade school and junior high, too.
tell us about her.
well, it's kind of hardto put into words.
yeah? 'cause Leroy Hitch did.
he actually wrote a song about her.
lovely words, heartfelt.
that's what was so tragic about the whole thing.
we all knew Leroy. He worked on all our cars.
we all thought that he was such a sweet and talented guy.
I-I mean, I went away to college,
and I heard that he and Emily were dating.
I didn't have any problem with it.
I kept telling her so.
but that, of course,
was before we knew what he was really capable of.
I've got a city-council meeting. Is there anything else?
where were you that night Emily was murdered?
I was up at college.
I got home the next morning. My parents waited up for me.
that it?
thank you.
my pleasure, Detective. Lieutenant.
lt. Rice. Oh, pardon me.
did you tell me that when y'all came in?
I sure did.
my apologies, lieutenant.
please do not put me on hold.
no, I know that I sent the paperwork in.
and if y'all missed it,
and because of that my husband was allowed to steal from me,
it's your fault and you will have to make it right.
Marissa, do not put me on...
damn it.
damn it!
havin' bank troubles? I...
Dwight. Don't.
got an accountant, an accountant... stop it.
stop it.
I'm fine.
Meddlin'.
incorrigible.
your ex-wife clock you on that?
you know she did.
are y'all still...
I know somebody. Girl at my church.
she will make you crazy, and you'll love every minute of it.
here, take her number.
how about you take my accountant's number?
okay, let's just work the case. Where to?
Hey, uh, we'd like you to clear somethin' up for us, If you don't mind.
you said Brian told you he'd rush back from college to talk your sister out of dating a black man.
well, he just told us he liked Leroy,
encouraged the idea of them being together.
what's the story?
we could ask you a lot of questions,
but maybe you'd like to tell us something.
no.
get it off your chest.
well, um...
we never used to fight, me and Emily, not ever...
except for that Christmas eve in '58.
so when Brian phoned...
I said, yeah, I would go and get her.
but...
then I said something out of spite...
I said, "Brian...
there's something I need to tell you.
Emily's dating a black man.
Yes.
I said it another way, but I did say that.
it's my fault she's dead. I'm...
Brian probably yelled at her And made her get into a fight with Leroy.
and then Leroy probably just snapped.
when Brian called for Emily that night,
Where'd he say he was calling from?
Oh, he was calling from, you know, university of Arkansas in Fayetteville.
case file says that he came home Christmas morning.
we need you to tell us your conversation with him on the phone Christmas eve.
every word you can remember.
well, I remember telling him that it was raining and there was a big storm.
and, um...
and then he laughed.
and h-he said, um...
Yeah, tell me about it. I'm an idiot.
I left my car windows rolled down, and everything got soaked.
Sutton, I need the weather for Fayetteville, Arkansas,
december 23 and 24, 1958.
all right.
you thinking that Brian was in town that Christmas eve.
I'm doing more than thinking.
Yeah, this Brian comes into town Christmas eve, goes to see Emily.
maybe he wants to get back together.
but, yeah, he was here in town that day.
his car gets soaking wet in the storm.
later he calls to make sure Emily's home.
her sister says she's datin' a black guy.
Brian goes nuts, comes over, they fight, he stabs her.
wipes the knife clean.
then hitch picks it up when he finds the body.
that's why his prints are on it.
thank you, Sutton.
not a single drop of rain in Fayetteville, Arkansas,
the entire month of December 1958.
Christmas eve, he's in town.
what we need is evidence, something concrete.
head wounds.
Emily had head wounds.
blunt object, right?
you think that's why it's cracked?
well, they never dusted it for prints.
same reason they didn't do the knife.
so certain they had the guy.
maybe check the felt on the bottom For chewing-tobacco residue.
guy's a secreter, we get DNA.
this is what you want, I'll try it.
well, Lordy, I shall not I shall not be moved I shall not I shall not be moved just like a tree growin' in the meadow I shall not be moved I'm on my way to glory I shall not be moved I'm on my way to glory I shall not be moved I'm like a tree planted by the water I shall not be moved I shall not I shall not be moved I shall not I shall not be moved just like a tree planted by the water I shall not be moved on this rock of ages I shall not be moved on this rock of ages I shall not be moved just like a tree planted by the water I shall not be moved glory hallelujah I shall not be moved glory hallelujah I shall not be moved just like a tree planted by the water

then, 20 minutes ago, it was like those bastards were trying to
well, I know what they were trying to do. Sir, please.
just go back to your apartment, okay?
I mean, you've been a great help, but I can take it from here.
thank you.
come in.
surpri
Oh, you're -- You're not Barbara.
no, sir, I'm not.
and, uh, whatever it is you got going on in there, you need to keep it down.
folks are complaining. Well, I haven't been making any noises.
I got home about 10 minutes ago, been doing my stretches.
well, obviously, this place has got pretty thin walls, so, uh, stretch more quietly.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
dispatch, 1256. Noise complaint is p
Hello?
MPD. Anybody home?
MPD! Anybody home?!
damn.
I cordoned off the apartment and made sure nobody touched the body until you all got here.
good work, Sutton.
pink hearts -- Some bold decorating choices.
we haven't started to canvass yet.
a couple down the hall described the guy who lived here as looking a lot like this guy
didn't know his name, though.
blunt-force trauma to the top of the head.
round drops, so these came out at 90 degrees when he got hit.
guy's about my height, so he was standing when it happened.
our doer was tall or used some sort of club.
let me see your flashlight, Sutton. Here you go.
take a look at this.
this whole outer portion is dry.
it's got dust in it.
so this part has to be at least a day or two old.
this isn't one stain. It's two -- One on top of the other.
it's hard to kill a man twice.
something else must have happened, right? Seems like it.
Sam Richard Walter, 4718 Cretchly Court.
it's one of those fancy gated areas out in Germantown.
so what's he doing in this less-than-fancy apartment?
maybe this has something to do with it.
our man Sam was a defense attorney.
important work -- Making sure people get their constitutional right to counsel.
true enough. Problem is, most of them are guilty and a fair number of them are assholes.
hold down the fort, Sutton.
whitehead, let's go to Sam's office
see if any of his clients fit into that category.
the dead lawyer's name is on the lease. Got the place two months ago.
neighbors in Germantown say he and his wife live out there full time.
turns out Sam Walter and his wife -- They don't have any kids.
Oh, Sam -- The husband with an apartment on the side.
didn't you know that was not gonna end well for you?
what's the wife saying? Nothing yet.
and we went to the house to notify her of his death, but she didn't answer the door, and she's not picking up her phone.
Really? I guess that officially makes her a suspect.
let's try a little harder to find her.
Yes, ma'am.
I know this must be a blow.
he was a -- A fine man
a fine man.
how long did you work for him?
uh, 25 years -- September.
I talked to some folks at the courthouse, and they said Sam had a rough few years
lost about five or six big cases.
that's -- That's true.
is it possible any of those clients might want to do him harm?
if I shared his files and confidences.
somebody killed him, Dolores
took him away from you.
you're not gonna let them get away with that, are you?
Sam had a -- A bleeding heart.
I mean, that was his real problem.
he -- He took on clients who -- Who couldn't pay their bills, made his finances a mess. I mean, we were about to lose our lease.
and then...We weren't.
so, what happened? He borrow money from the wrong people?
no.
he started making... Extra money.
how? He wouldn't tell me.
Oh, yeah, but nothing gets by you, does it?
I buttered up time security guard
literally, with my shortbread.
this is a -- A list of names Sam gave to him.
uh, these people came to meetings, strictly off the books.
I mean, Sam never breathed a word of this to me.
it's not a client file, so I guess I can pass it along.
I'm sure Sam would be grateful.
he was lucky to have you.
thank you.
how did it go? Crime tech already rolled.
I'm just closing up the scene. Did we finish the canvass?
Yeah, everybody but folks who
what was that?
where did that come from? I mean, I know where babies come from.
but that particular baby -- Where did it come from?
Hey, there, sweetheart.
aren't you beautiful?
same sheet as inside.
which means this baby came from Sam Walter's apartment.
whoever put her here might be his killer.
Hey, you.
Hey, our ER doc says our little girl is 4 or 5 days old, and it does not look like she was delivered by professionals.
well, that explains the other bloodstain in the apartment.
Sam might be the daddy, but his wife is 60.
I doubt if she's the mother. Maybe she thought that cracking him in the head was easier than divorcing him.
if the birth mother saw the crime, she'd have good reason to believe that Mrs. Walter would come after her, too.
could be she put the baby in the cruiser to protect it.
we need to find her.
she's the only other person we know for sure that was in that apartment.
uh, look at this. Every month for the last three months,
Sam got a check from a Peter Branson for $1, 155.
then, a few days later, he wrote a rent check to van mosley villas for...$1, 155.
I went down to social services, but there wasn't a welfare officer available to take custody of her.
there was a "P. Branson
on that nighttime visitors' list we got from that secretary.
this is probably him, then, 'cause this Peter Branson did eight months last year for felony possession of stolen property, and Sam Walter was his attorney.
come here, sweetie. Come on, sweetie.
Oh, yeah, I know.
Yes, sweetie. Oh, my. Oh, my!
Reggie, go get Branson and ask about the checks and we need the baby baby's mother here Go to the apartment and ask all around I can sing and still be in charge
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am!
here. You're the nanny till social services comes.
no, I don't know anything about babies.
and I -- And I might actually be overstating my abilities.
Oh, come on, Davey.
you carry a big old gun d patrol the streets at night.
you're gonna let a little, tiny baby scare you?
you are cute.
Yeah, I got in some trouble last year.
Sam was my lawyer, and, um, he let me do a payment plan to pay off his bill.
so your payment plan is you pay the rent on his apartment?
cause those amounts are exactly the same.
I'm just doing what Sam wants. You can ask him.
I mean, it's a payment plan. It's all aboveboard.
Really?
Yeah.
how'd you like jail, Pete? Did it suit you?
cause you're going back for impeding a police investigation. Wait. I'm not impeding anything. I just
Sam Walter was murdered last night in that apartment you're paying for.
what?
he's dead? Yeah.
and what about the baby -- Is she okay?
who said anything about a baby?
look, my wife can't have kids and felons can't legally adopt, and Sam said he'd help us out.
for 40 grand, he said he could get us a healthy baby.
Sam brokered illegal adoptions?
no, not normally.
I-I think he felt bad because he didn't get me off last year.
but the baby -- She's okay?
Yeah, she's fine -- Real cute.
who's her mother?
I'm really not sure.
uh, she didn't want to meet us, so we just talked on the phone.
she, uh -- She said her name was Christie.
Christie? That's all you've got.
look, I know how this sounds, but... We would never hurt Sam.
he was making our dream come true.
they found Sam's wife.
she's been on a cruise for the last week. She was pretty broken up about the news.
did she know anything about the baby? Apparently not.
you get anything from the folks on the first floor?
fresh-baked snickerdoodles...
from the lady in apartment 15. How about you?
well, Mrs. meyer in 51 never saw Sam Walter or the girl.
Mr. Wilson in apartment 55 saw the girl, didn't know she was pregnant, and was certain her name was Jersey.
and the woman in apartment 60 thought I looked like her grandson.
so we're nowhere on finding the baby's mom?
not yet.
knock, knock.
I ain't bothering anybody, anyhow. No, ma'am.
but it looks like you've lived here for a while.
who's asking?
detectives Hendricks and white, mPD.
hmm. Well, if you're not rousting me, then I'm thinking you need something.
um, have you seen anyone pregnant or a -- A new baby around these apartments?
Yeah, that baby was pink as a newborn squirrel.
Really?
have you ever actually even seen a newborn squirrel? What's it to you?
not a thing.
did you see who was with the baby?
a young girl -- Pale, kind of nervous, but she was real nice.
can you tell us anything else about this girl?
well, she gave me this shirt.
can we get you anything for your trouble?
are those snickerdoodles?
Yeah. They sure are.
thank you, ma'am.
those were my cookies. I'm gonna pretend like you didn't say that.
God's path
isn't that a halfway house for female parolees?
Yep. Sam Walter should have known better than to have a girlfriend that could take him in a fight.
I'm sorry, detective Hendricks, but your witness is mistaken.
look, we're not saying this resident definitely committed a crime, but we're still gonna need to talk to her.
what you're saying is that, unbeknownst to us, one of our charges carried a baby to term.
and what I'm telling you is that's not possible.
a murder's been committed, sister Agnes, so I'm afraid I can't take your word for it.
you don't have to. All of our residents were signed in by 6: 00 last night, as well as every night before that.
we have a curfew. We insist that everyone abides by it.
who watches them sign in? Whoever's available.
then, as much as it pains me, I have to assume one of you helped a resident hide a pregnancy, as well as covered that person's absence from the house.
I'm afraid you're all gonna have to come with us down to the station.
they had nothing to do with this.
I'm so sorry, sisters. This is all my fault.
all right, so, who's the resident we should talk to?
none of them.
it was me. I'm the baby's mother.
I wish somebody would have told a 14 year old me that one day I'd be questioning a nun about a murder.
might have made sister Mary Margaret's threats about me going to hell for bad behavior a little easier to ignore. I doubt it.
well, unless she travels with a 9-iron, she's too short to be the doer.
maybe, but I bet you she knows who it is.
all right.
how's the baby? Is she okay?
the baby's fine.
now let's talk about how she ended up in the back of a police car.
a man is dead, sister Catherine Thomas.
the right thing for you to do is tell me how that happened.
I don't know.
was Sam the baby's father?
no. Sam loved his wife.
then why was he there?
he was helping me find a home for my baby.
he rented me that apartment so that I could do this all in sect.
which explains how you know each other and what your business was, but not how he ended up dead today.
I was recuperating.
the sisters thought I was in Iowa, visiting family.
Sam stopped by to check on me, and someone started banging on the door.
Sam went to see who it was and told me I should take the baby and run.
you have no idea who was doing the banging?
no.
if you weren't afraid of the person at the door, why put the baby in a police car?
I got outside, and I realized...
where would I go?
I don't have any money or normal clothes.
I needed to do the best thing for my baby.
putting her in the police car seemed like the best option.
can anyone else confirm that you're the baby's mother?
I went to a clinic for exams.
I used the name Christie Thomas.
who's the baby's father, sister Catherine?
I'm sorry, detective Hendricks.
I can't tell you.
no disrespect, sister Catherine, but...I'm not sure I believe anything you've told me.
back off. She's quiet.
and she's an angel.
but I got to make copies for the staff meeting.
use the auto feed. It's broken.
look, you can't move her.
if I stop pressing this button, she'll start crying.
I can't have that. This is the first thing I've tried that worked, so there's a Kinko's across the street, detective.
Hey, Davey.
Hey, Reggie. Thank God you're here.
Aww. You called Dwight's mom? Y'all weren't helping me.
you know, this is some creative problem solving here, but it's not a long-term solution.
so why don't we move her?
just move her.
let's get out of the machine. She's not crying.
well, she's asleep. Davey, good job.
good job.
alta Vista women's clinic verified that Christie Thomas was a patient.
there's no name on the father, but the nurse remembers that he was tall, around 6 foot.
Hey, sweetie.
what's my mama doing here?
babysitting, I guess. So, where are we?
well, the baby's father seems to be our best angle. Here?
if Sam was the middleman for an illegal adoption,
the fact that the nun won't give us the name certainly doesn't make him seem innocent.
I can go at her again,
that'll teach her. Follow her.
she can't stay away from him too long.
can you imagine being the guy a nun decides to have sex with?
I'd like to think I'd have the good sense to say "no.
why -- You afraid to have your feet on fire for all of eternity?
no, just a person's bound to have doubts.
the least I can do is be decent when those moments occur.
so what if there is no father, know what I mean?
immaculate conception? You don't believe that.
wish I did.
I guess there's only so many tragedies you can see before you stop believing in miracles.
let me put it this way, whitehead
we sacrifice so that others might believe.
who's that?
sister Catherine in street clothes.
I guess rice was right.
I won't tell her you said so.
get off me! Let me go! What the hell?
MPD!
stop it! Let me go! Hey, let her go!
Aah! Make sure she's okay.
dark sedan. Partial plate -- Tennessee, 3-zebra-Alpha.
I'll get an a. P.B. Out right away.
Thanks, Sutton.
you okay?
she said that she was headed to the bus to go to the grocery store.
was that the baby's father?
no. I told you -- He has nothing to do with this.
you got to realize you not wanting to talk about him or letting us talk to him
it's making me think he killed Sam.
he didn't. I promise.
so, who attacked you?
that was my father.
what's his name? Harlin Thomas.
Hey, Sutton, it's Dwight again.
put an APB out on a Harlin Thomas.
he tried to run me over. He should be considered dangerous.
will do. What's Harlin's connection in this?
When...I got pregnant, I didn't know who to turn to.
he said he'd find a -- A lawyer who could do an adoption.
I had no idea he was selling the baby.
turns out my dad was getting a $25, 000 finders' fee.
my guess is Harlin's got money troubles.
among other troubles.
when I heard the banging,
I knew bad things were gonna happen.
that was your father, banging on the door at the apartment?
I didn't want to leave Sam alone, but...
you had to protect the baby.
so I grabbed our stuff, and I headed out the window.
why didn't you tell me about your dad before?
I guess...
I didn't want to believe that he could kill someone.
Harlin Thomas, 48 years old.
guy was in time on everything from check fraud to drugs.
was it his car that tried to run me down?
he's the proud owner of an oldsmobile, license 0-baker-4-3-zebra-Alpha.
uniforms are en route as we speak.
good. Where are we with the
what the hell is -- hey, that's not for you!
well, what's it doing in my coffeepot?
cause I'm heating it up for little Perneria Nula. It's a temporary name
unless, of course, the parents like it.
sounds like a rash, Sutton. It is exotic -- I concur.
it belonged to my great aunt. She taught me how to salsa dance when I was 8.
Oh, evidence is done with the nun's bag.
give me that. It's not like I want it, anyway.
didn't our nun say she was running to catch a bus?
she did.
why do you catch a bus if you got a car?
all this baby stuff -- Maybe this is what she grabbed on her way out of Sam's apartment.
if Catherine's got the keys, maybe the vehicle's still at the scene.
ford f-150 -- Not exactly a nun-mobile.
maybe it's the baby's dad.
let's find that truck so we can find him.
maybe he'll confirm her story.
Yeah, that's my truck. I loaned it to my boy, Damon.
we'd like to talk to him. I'm not sure where he is.
I haven't talked to him since Tuesday.
that doesn't worry you? Ever since he knocked up that girlfriend of his,
Damon spends most of his time with her.
you seem awfully unconcerned about the circumstances of this pregnancy.
it's not the choice I would have made for him, but he's taking responsibility for himself, acting like a man -- That's what I'd want him to do.
do you know how we could reach Damon?
well, call him. We did. He didn't answer.
well, I think I have the girlfriend's number here somewhere.
we already have sister Catherine at the station.
well, then maybe the sister can give you Christie's number.
but sister Catherine is Christie, right?
Sister...Catherine?
well, you mean like sister sister?
like nun sister. Oh, no. Christie's not a nun.
she's a -- She's a junior in high school.
Catherine's not the baby's mother. She's the aunt.
means not only is the father unaccounted for, the mother is, too.
we got photos of both kids on the street.
we're checking into shelters and hospitals.
greenback's talking to their friends
see if anybody knows where they are.
six years
that's how long it takes to become a nun.
she was willing to throw all that away for those kids.
I guess that's a version of having God on your side.
I'll go talk to her again.
it's basically stick, stick with the disposables.
how's it going?
Davey is making wonderful progress. He's a natural.
thank you, ma'am.
Dwight, I'm telling you -- When you have children, this woman's gonna be a lifesaver for you.
I'm sure.
so, when are you gonna settle down and get serious, anyway?
just officer Sutton and I are just talking about our hopes and dreams.
well, I work with Sutton, so maybe you shouldn't
children are a blessing, Dwight. Yes, they are.
where is our bundle of caffeine? She's taking a nap.
I need to borrow her. She's not a lawn mower, Dwight.
I know. My mama wouldn't have shown up for a lawn mower.
very nice.
she's bigger than she was just two days ago.
Yeah, she looks like you around the eyes.
of course, I got my aunt's eyes, too.
you have to stop lying to me, sister Catherine.
I've had about enough.
we know about Christie and Damon.
did they kill Sam? No.
are you protecting them from Harlin?
Yes.
cause nobody's seen them since the day Sam was killed.
I'm sure they're fine.
I think Christie and Damon put the baby in that police car.
cause, while they were hiding outside, waiting for you...
let me make sure they're safe, sister Catherine.
do you mind?
my dad...
he didn't used to be like this.
when I was little, he was a good man.
but then, when Christie's mom died
that's who raised us both
he started drinking and doing drugs.
I wanted to stand up to him, but I couldn't.
God showed me a way out, but...
I never should have left my sister.
where would Christie and Damon go?
when they decided not to go through with the adoption...
I got them an apartment in West Memphis.
that's where I was headed when you picked me up. Give me an address.
I'll send someone to make sure they're okay.
whitehead's got West Memphis PD out looking for them.
good. Good.
what -- What did you find out about Harlin Thomas' place?
he hasn't been there since Tuesday.
but a neighbor's told us Harlin's got a drug problem.
he tried to borrow money recently 'cause he got himself in debt to a bookie to pay for his habit.
guess how much he owes. 25 grand.
exactly what he was supposed to make from selling that baby.
Harlin's not gonna be very happy when he finds out those kids left that baby with the police.
Oh, you got spit-up like a skunk stripe all the way down the back of your uniform.
badge of honor, Reggie -- Badge of honor.
well, I think you also get a badge for something else.
Oh, no!
did you poop on Davey?
Sutton.
that was West Memphis PD kids aren't there.
Hey, Dwight, whitehead.
we got a hit on the APB for Harlin Thomas' oldsmobile.
it's outside the station right now.
all right, Sutton, stay with that baby in case Harlin got in the precinct. You got it.
here, get the passenger side.
put your hands on the steering wheel!
Damon? Harlin made me come here. He's got Christie.
he told me if I don't bring him the baby that he's not gonna let her go.
so, Harlin sent you?
Yeah, right after we told him we put the baby in the police car.
not the brightest idea -- Sending you into a police station to steal a baby.
he still thinks he could sell her, you know, raise some money and get out of town.
he doesn't want to go to jail for killing Sam.
so he admits to the deed? I-I don't think that he meant to do it.
I mean, Harlin's totally tweaked. He's half out of his mind.
it's worse than I've ever seen him. Where is he?
Capri motel, out in Wolfchase.
SWAT wired a camera through the vent. Harlin's got two shotguns and a . 45.
he's not responding to the bullhorn.
they're ready to move in. If SWAT moves in, he's gonna kill her.
I know.
we need to let him know there's another way out.
you want me to talk to him?
this has been done before with family members, when the hostage taker isn't responding to the police.
but we're not close. But you're family.
you can connect to parts of him that we can't reach.
I don't think I can do this.
I can do all things through God, who strengthens me.
I did love catechism.
sister Catherine... I know you're scared, but you know you're not alone.
excuse me. Yes.
I'm from social services. I'm looking for officer Sutton.
Oh, yeah, he was -- He was just here.
please, just have a seat. I'll go -- I'll go find him.
thank you. Uh-huh.
social services is here.
I guess they had to come eventually.
well, our little girl needs a bed.
she can't sleep in the car seat forever.
in my whole life,
I've never been with a baby more than a minute or two.
I'd always get scared off by how much care they needed.
but what I realized is how special giving that care can make you feel.
do you think she'll know I existed?
I think she'll remember that she was loved, even if she doesn't quite know where that love came from.
she's something, isn't she?
thank you, little Perneria Nula, for letting us be a part of your life.
it's a good name, right?
it suits her.
I think so, too.
just help him feel that he's not alone in this.
dad, it's Cathy.
get out of here, girl!
no.
there's nothing you can do.
maybe not, but...I can't leave here without Christie.
is she okay?
Yeah.
I screwed up, Cathy. I screwed up bad.
remember when mom was sick and you couldn't cook, but you'd put that tray on the bed and put a pillowcase over it, like a tablecloth?
you'd call it the spectacular cereal selection or -- Or "peanut butter and the seven jellies.
and then, when mom was gone, you took me to church and you'd show me the stained-glass windows and told me what mom was doing in heaven.
you helped me through that.
now you need help, dad, and I'm gonna help you get it.
Mr. Thomas, uh, I'm detective Hendricks.
sister Catherine's right. We just want to help you.
I'm gonna go ahead and put down my gun now, and I-I just ask the same courtesy of you.
if you'll just put your hands on your head, we need to make sure Christie's okay.
sister Catherine, nice to see you again.
hello. Hi.
cookies from the nuns of God's path.
Oh, it's a miracle -- Snickerdoodles.
how are Christie and Damon?
they're good.
social services gave Damon's father temporary custody until they decide what they want to do.
what's her name Angela.
what you guys do every day
being so brave and believing that people deserve justice and kindness
I think it's amazing.
and I just wanted to say thank you...
for helping me.
you're welcome.
enjoy.
thank you.
listen, if Sutton asks, they named her Perneria.
do I get your half of the cookies? If that's what it takes.
Perneria it is.
Yeah.
all right, we'll be there in 20 minutes.
fire at the carver movie theater last night, Gutted the place.
arson?
assault in the parking lot around the same time makes them think so.
they'd like for us to assist.
man, the carver's as much a part of Memphis as the peabody.
saw my first Elvis movie there with my dad--"Jailhouse Rock.
Anne Marie and I had a date there not two weeks ago
saw "Last Tango In Paris."Sexy movie.
made for quite an interesting night, if you know what I mean.
thanks for the lasting image, Whitehead.
detective Hendricks, could I see you in my office?
the carver burned down. Me and Whitehead are gonna go check it out.
building's already burned. This'll only take a moment.
meet you there. - Good luck.
Dwight, this is special prosecutor Hilliard Sherman from the U. S. attorney's office.
sorry to bother you at work, detective.
I wouldn't have if it wasn't very important.
usually my office will just send a registered letter, but I thought the gravity of the situation warranted
look, Mr. Sherman, I appreciate you trying to put a front porch on this, but let's just get right to why you're here.
the Louisiana prison system has what's known as a compassionate release law.
inmates can request early release on special grounds, such as terminal illness.
this is about Tim Mason. - Yes.
he has brain cancer, only a few months to live.
well, he still killed my father when he was on duty.
Yes, and obviously you and your mother, as involved parties, have to agree to his release.
when's the hearing?
three days, but you don't have to attend.
and since he's at Angola, Because that was the closest super-Max to Memphis
everyone will understand when you don't.
I've got two forms
one for you, one for your mother.
you can fax them to my assistant.
thank you, Mr. Sherman. - Thank you.
takes some kind of grade -"A" asshole to set blaze to the only movie revival house we have in town.
spent most of my childhood in there, eating popcorn and m&m's.
I was thrilled when it was re-opened.
we've identified the point of origin as the theater's storage closet.
it started there then spread through the door.
and the cause?
some kind of gothic-style oil lamp.
well, why use a zippo when you got Cleopatra's lamp? The assault?
out here in the parking lot.
EMTs took him to Memphis Memorial.
how bad's his injury? - Not bad, unless you count the damage the thc did to his brain cells.
he was smoking dope when they picked him up?
we don't know what he was doing earlier in the evening, but according to the EMT, the kid heard the sirens and remembered he had a huge tray of pot brownies in his car.
when the paramedics found him, he was scarfing down every last crumb.
which means he's stoned.
I'll have to wait for him to come down from this chocolate-weed high before I can question him.
Yep. - Fan-friggin'-tastic.
I thought you were headed over to the carver fire.
well, if you don't mind, lieutenant, I need to take some time to go down to New Orleans to meet with Tim Mason.
Mr. Sherman said you and Paula Ann could send in those forms.
the man killed my father.
I was just a boy.
and I want to look him in the eye and say my piece.
what's your piece?
I'm going, lieutenant, whether you give me the time off or not.
I wasn't gonna fight you on this, Dwight.
so, tell me about this kid Bryan that you had working concession.
he's, He's a good kid.
worked for us since high school.
you knew him well enough to expect that he'd have a half a pound of pot brownies in his car?
we knew he liked to partake once in a while.
a half a pound's not ally personal quantity.
it's more like "set up your own store, invite all your friends" quantity.
Oh, Bryan's not that kind of kid.
we know the fire started in the storage room. Is there any particular reason that he would go in there?
I mean, could that be where he was hiding his main stash?
I'm sorry, but, uh...
this is all that's left.
honey.
all that's left of what?
Dave's father was a big Elvis fan.
he left him the complete 35-millimeter film prints of two of Elvis' early movies.
viva Las Vegas," "king creole," back when Elvis was still lean and mean.
you mind if I take them for a sec? I need them to sign some forms.
no, go ahead. I'll catch up with you.
detective?
what do you have?
well, the kid that was assaulted had a good deal of pot on him.
combined with the fact that this neighborhood's kind of gone unsavory over the last couple of years,
I'd say it was a drug deal gone bad.
we should check the theater owners' financials so we can rule out insurance fraud.
so, where's Dwight?
he asked for a few days free.
I'm gonna cover for him. - Don't you have a department to run?
I'm running it. Detective greenback's on a field trip with his daughter.
so does "lending a hand" mean that you're gonna just take over?
lending a hand" means lending a hand.
are you testing me? Is that what this is? - No test, just a hand being lent.
listen, you've been real clear about what you think about my work ethics.
I think you're being rather sensitive about this, detective.
Charlie White, you have my word, You are in charge of this investigation.
for this one, I'm working for you. - Good.
let's go to work.
honey, it's mama.
in here.
there. - mama.
Tanya called, told me you're going down to New Orleans.
I am.
I'm assuming she told you about Tim Mason's request.
why don't we just send in those forms and be done with it?
it's not that simple.
what's not simple?
the right thing to do is to let that man have his last months on God's earth surrounded by his family.
I got questions, mama, questions only he can answer.
let sleeping dogs lie.
I was fine letting the dog sleep, but now the dog wants out of his cage.
I'm going down there. I'm settled on that.
well, it's a good thing I packed a bag.
cause if you're going, I'm coming with you.
neighbors say there's been significant after-hours activity at the theater these past few months
lots of people coming and going. No shows, but some kind of parties.
I don't suppose the theater owners mentioned anything to you about the parties?
didn't say a word to me.
what you got there, Sutton? - It's from MFD.
there's a note in there addressed to you.
interesting assortment of goodies.
mfd has tagged this as "out of the ordinary" evidence.
I'll say. What is that, a pacifier?
in the storage closet.
doesn't exactly look like stuff from "gone with the wind," does it?
maybe the concession kid was supplying ecstasy to teenage rave parties.
just freaked and set the fire for kicks?
or started the fire to keep Bryan from knowing they took his stash.
there's, uh, an engraving on this bullwhip handle."Mys va.
if we can track down where that was purchased from, maybe we can ID the buyer.
maybe we can come up with
I'll make a list of shops that sell bullwhips and sex toys.
Sutton, go down to Memphis memorial, pick up this pothead when he gets released, and bring him back.
okay.
did you get the results of that background check yet?
it's in process.
you let me know what you hear.
is there something the matter, officer Sutton?
did Whitehead just give you an ord... Two orders?
he did. Detective White will be running this investigation.
I know. Pigs are flying.
you're unusually quiet, mama.
you got something to say, say it.
your daddy's case was pored over by detectives and lawyers. You know, it was a random crime, bad luck.
mama, I know what the case file says. I've I've looked over it a thousand times.
what is the speed limit on this road?
I think I saw a sign back there that said "55," but we went by it so fast, I don't know.
look Dad made a routine traffic stop, right?
the witness said he saw dad arguing with Tim Mason.
then all of a sudden...Mason bolted from the car.
Dwight, honey, just slow down.
but before he shot dad, there were several minutes when they were out of the witness' sight.
and I want to know what happened in those missing minutes.
sweetheart, there were no missing minutes.
license and registration.
you should show him your badge when he comes back.
I'm not gonna show that officer my badge so I can get out of a ticket, mama.
you know, I know you love your car, son, but you might want to consider switching to a vehicle that that warns you when you go over the speed limit, like my new car.
do you have that rear-view camera that helps you park?
I sure do.
I just look at that tv screen and back on up.
you know, most people can't pull off that color gray, but it really works with your blue eyes.
I'm not gonna give you a ticket.
you got a real nice mother there. Why don't you slow down a little?
precious cargo you're carrying. - Will do.
thank you, officer. - Yes, ma'am.
is this, like, a trick?
no, it's like a brownie.
Bryan, I could arrest you 15 ways to Sunday, so why don't you start telling me what went on last night?
the The theater's closed on mondays, but I needed a place to veg out.
see, I live with my mom. - Of course you do.
Yeah, so, sometimes I just need some space to chill.
so, how'd you end up unconscious in the parking lot?
I don't know. One minute, I'm listening to my iPod.
the next, I'm lying facedown in the gravel, with no clue how I got there.
so maybe the guy that you were selling drugs to hit you in the head, and he started the fire.
I don't deal.
medicinal purposes?
how'd you know?
in fact, I don't even really like pot.
I like chocolate, but chocolate makes me nauseous, so, like, the pot helps.
I know that there were teen rave parties going on at the theater, so what happened?
one of the kids start the fire?
no, there were parties in the theater, but they weren't teenagers.
what were they? - Like, weird adult sex parties.
is that what was going on last night?
dude, I saw my 3rd-grade teacher, Mrs. pond, wearing leather and a dog collar.
that must have been a scarring experience. - Totally.
what was your involvement in these parties, Bryan? Boy toy?
nada.
seriously.
no, Dave totally kept me out of it.
why don't you wait right here?
3rd-grade teachers in dog collars?
that's some kinky.
the owners talked to me about the Elvis prints, but they failed to mention they were hosting sex parties.
so, what are you gonna do?
let's go talk to the husband.
come on, mama. We got to get going. - I got to stretch a little bit.
with those g-forces from your fast driving, blood's collecting in my legs.
I'm gonna leave you here, then. - No, you're not.
Dwight, you're just making yourself crazy over all this.
and I'm asking you -- Please, let's just turn around, go back home to Memphis.
mama, I can't go back yet.
nothing good can come from going to Angola. You're just chasing ghosts.
we'll see about that when we get there, won't we?
what has got you so riled up? Baby boy, look at you.
I found this in one of dad's old police procedure books.
half-cut money is something dirty cops have, mama.
how did dad end up with this?
I-I don't know.
look, I-I didn't want to tell you about this, but...
I need to find out what this means. I have to.
so, we know you've been hosting after-hours sex parties here in this theater.
hosted? No. Now, Megan doesn't know what I'm about to tell you.
okay.
I rented out our theater to these people who held adult parties, but that's all.
Really?
all these sexy ladies, and you never got involved?
sometimes they'd want to play vintage pornography up on the big screen, and I would run the projector.
but I always felt very uncomfortable being here.
sure.
porn's not my style, detective.
Dave, we've had a look at your financials.
seems like you're going through a difficult time.
Yeah, the renovation on the interior was a little more expensive than we anticipated, so when I was approached about these parties, I figured the extra cash would stem the bleeding.
you know it's looking a hell of a lot like insurance fraud.
it's not possible. - Why's that?
because I didn't have insurance on the theater.
paperwork shows you had coverage. - Up until last month.
but things were getting so tight, I let it lapse.
that's just gonna break her heart.
I'm gonna need names and info on the party hosts.
I-I don't know their real names.
come on. You're gonna have to do better than that.
they paid in cash. They're going by the name of mystic and Harry "V."
they have an erotica shop.
you give them keys to the theater?
they gave me a big deposit, so I gave them a set.
from what we hear, you have keys, which means you have access.
so, what happened?
crazy orgy got out of control? Someone got a little bit pissed off, threw an oil lamp?
is that how the fire started?
you think we burned down the carver?
might be willing to believe it was an accident. Was it?
we don't know. We weren't at the theater last night.
where were you? - At a 30th-birthday swingers' party.
can anybody confirm that?
we're a very free-loving and trusting community. We don't kiss and tell.
well, you better get a little less free-loving and give me a list of everyone that showed up, or I'm gonna get a whole lot less forgiving, pal.
I'm not giving you anything without a warrant.
there's strict laws in Memphis about operating sex clubs--Imprisonable laws.
I can imagine how popular you two are gonna be in jail.
I mean, the nipple clamps alone look, detective It looks like you got their attention.
seems as though I do.
so, how about we take a look at that list of names?
I know you didn't have to, but I'm grateful that you did.
I know that what I did is unforgivable, and I can never give you back what I took from you.
but please believe me when I tell you...
I am a changed man.
behind these walls, I found God.
or should I say, God's found me.
excuse me.
mama. Mama.
I'm so sorry, Dwight. I am.
it's hard to see him in person.
I thought I'd moved on and forgiven him. I mean, it's been 31 years.
when I saw that man's face, When I saw him, I just wanted to choke him with my bare hands.
there's some taxicabs out that front gate. Let me just get one of them.
I'll drive you.
just wait in the car, okay?
I'll just be a few minutes. - Okay one of the sex club members called Dave's cellphone several times the night before the fire.
bring him in. - I did. He's in interrogation, waiting for you.
name is Neil Dekay.
this guy served 30 days last year in county for assault.
he has anger issues.
maybe he started a fight with Dave.
fight turned to threat, threat turned to arson.
could be. - Good luck.
well, w-wait a minute. This guy's a degenerate pervert who belongs to a sex club. You take him.
use your...Feminine wiles.
that is extremely misogynistic, Charlie White, even for you.
good luck, lieutenant.
okay, I'm here. Talk.
well, like I said, I'm a changed man.
what happened back then was like a whole nother lifetime.
in romans 12: 2,the Bible says,"let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think.
it took me a long time in here to learn that.
there better be a good reason you pulling me off my job midday?
why did you call Dave Hargrove last night before the fire at the carver?
because I wanted to know what was playing at the midnight show.
am I losing a paycheck for this?
I am an impatient woman, Neil.
now, I don't know what type you usually go for, but I'm of the dominating variety.
you give me a credible answer of why you called Dave, or this is gonna go down very badly for you, little boy.
all right, hold out much longer, you're gonna need a safe word.
okay. We had a disagreement, but I fixed it.
a disagreement or argument?
the last party I went to, I see my girlfriend coming out of the storage room with Dave.
he's not even part of our club.
so I ask him about it, and he says that he was showing her some Elvis movie prints, but I didn't buy it.
did you confront him then? - No.
I wanted to, but my girlfriend told me I was being stupid and I should just let it alone.
but you couldn't, could you?
I called him the next day, A couple times, But he never picked up.
so you went down there.
is that when you threatened to burn the place down?
No! We talked. We We straightened it out.
turns out the guy actually does have Elvis prints.
you know, that's who you need to be talking to, is that skinny fella.
what skinny fella. - I stopped in the John when I was leaving.
as I'm coming out, I hear Dave yelling at some guy in the office.
what were they yelling about, Neil?
the same Elvis prints, and something about it not being about the money.
I was just a form of wasted human life back then.
what I done to you and your mama was unspeakable, and I'd give anything in the world if I could take it all back.
all right, I've heard what you had to say.
now I got some questions for you. - All right.
right before you killed my dad, you were picked up for selling things that had fallen off the back of the truck.
the man who owned that truck was a known member of the Memphis mafia.
I don't know nothing about that.
you know I'm the only one between you and sunlight, right?
I don't know what you want from me.
I just want to get out of here and spend my remaining days with my little grandkids.
I'm throwing myself on your mercy and hoping you'll be understanding.
what do you know about that money?
I've never seen that before.
that's dirty-cop money. If my dad was killed because of this, I want to know why.
I got no idea what you're driving at.
the only way I let you out of here is if you tell me what the hell possessed you to trigger my father.
I didn't know your father.
he was just a cop that pulled me over when I was high.
you lying son of a bitch. - No, I'm not.
here's what I think , My dad was on the take, but he wanted to stop.
problem is, they wouldn't let him, so they sent you to take him out.
your father pulled me over.
how in the world could I have planned that?
so, you're saying it was totally random.
Yes, I am. - Bullshit.
you can rot in hell, for all I care.
buddy. How's it going down there?
I'm hanging in there. What about you?
piece of cake. What can I tell you? It's like a picnic.
I need you to do me a favor. - What you got going?
need you to check the system, see if you can find out who Tim Mason's first cellmate at Angola was, - where he might be now. - What are you thinking?
well, if a guy's gonna spill the truth, he's gonna do it in his early years in prison, you know, when the guilt's still fresh.
consider it done. - Thanks, Whitehead.
all right, buddy. Be safe. - All right. You too, buddy.
can we go home now?
not just yet, mama.
Dwight, nothing you do will bring your father back.
I'm not trying to bring him back.
I just need to know about that money.
those Elvis prints are worth 50 grand a pop.
selling those would have solved Dave's money problems in one fell swoop.
maybe the skinny kid that he was arguing with didn't want to take no for an answer and decided to force the issue by starting the fire.
I'm already scanning buyers on eBay, checking recent memorabilia auctions, cross-checking those with Elvis-convention attendees, basically just looking for anybody who could afford those prints in the first place.
good job, Sutton.
thank you, White...Head. Detective.
I dug a little deeper into Dave's finances.
it turns out those Elvis prints were insured independently of the theater.
I bet he didn't let that policy lapse, did he? - Nope, didn't.
probably wanted to sell the prints and then collect on the policy.
double-dipping Dave.
Clark. Charlie White, MPD.
I was Mason's first cellmate.
that make me famous or something?
he ever talk about the murder that got him sent there?
who's asking?
he tell you why he did it?
no good reason.
he was young, out of his mind on drugs, Random.
I don't buy that. I know what life is like for ex-cons. I could make things very difficult for you.
what did I ever do to you?
I need to know the truth.
and then you'll go away? - I got no reason to stay.
tim told me that he don't remember what happened the night he killed that cop.
what are you talking about? He confessed to shooting him in the alley.
he went along with that story because that's what everybody said happened.
but he was so messed up, he don't remember one second of that night.
y-you're telling me all Tim Mason knows about what happened is what people told him?
that's what he said.
got no reason to lie.
I got to get back to work.
Hello, handsome.
want a beer?
sure.
you singing tonight?
I sing every night. You know that.
you in town on a case?
in a manner of speaking. I'm sorry I didn't call.
well, friendship means never having to say you're in New Orleans.
so, what brings you back to town?
and don't say it's to hear me sing,'cause you heard plenty when we were both back in Memphis.
the man who murdered my father is up for parole at Angola.
the hearing's tomorrow.
why would they let him out of prison?
he's sick, got brain cancer, only a few months to live.
so, in his final days, he wants to go be with his family, and the only thing keeping that from happening is you?
Yep.
you gonna let him out?
I don't know.
I don't know.
so, why don't you admit it, Dave?
you were looking for a graceful way out of your financial mess, so you took the prints and started the fire as a distraction.
took the prints? They burned in the fire.
not according to MFD. I had them run a test on the film canisters
no triacetate residue at all.
I don't understand. - Well, let me clear it up for you.
there's no forced entry. The sex-store perverts' alibi checked out.
Bryan sure as hell didn't hit himself in the head.
so, as far as I'm concerned, you're my prime suspect.
when the carver theater came up for auction, Megan and I mortgaged everything we had to buy and restore it.
it's our Our shared dream, our shared love.
I wouldn't burn it down, not in a million years.
where were you the night of the fire, Dave?
I was at home with my wife, watching a William Powell movie marathon on tv.
using your wife as an alibi is pretty damn lame.
but it's true.
on our night off, we stay up all night and...
and watch movies.
could -- Could I get a drink of water?
you got something caught in your throat, Dave?
no.
I can't lie to you anymore. You're right. I did it.
you did it?
I was ashamed of our financial troubles, and I didn't want to admit the truth.
so I burned it down.
I'll be right back.
was that a confession?
he's lying. I can feel it.
no sign of the Elvis prints inside the memorabilia shop.
here you go.
but Sutton just texted me that this guy
Ernie Matson was recently in a memorabilia chat room, talking about a big score that he's about to make.
they're trying to drum up interest.
I guess even scumbags believe in the power of technology.
it's too sweet. It's yours.
but you already drank out of this.
I don't have cooties.
Hello, Ernie Matson.
what you gonna do?
make it up as I go.
you learn that at the academy?
20 years on the street.
I'm guessing that a sweet little thing like you must have had some trouble somewhere in your life with the law, resulting in a criminal record.
and maybe there might be a little trouble still out there.
if I was to dig just a little bit, I bet I'd find it, huh?
that's what I thought.
so, why don't you hand me those keys, and you take those 5-inch heels for a little walk?
well, well, well, Elvis is in the building. What do you know about that?
whoa, whoa...what's happening here?
MPD, my friend. Where'd you get these babies?
I got these aboveboard, y'all.
make me a believer, Ernie.
I'm telling you, I've been wanting to buy these from Dave for a long time, but he wouldn't sell.
so, what the hell are they doing in your trunk?
you just took them and decided to burn the place down?
I'm telling you, man, I own these out legit.
I wouldn't buy from her any other way.
if you don't have title, you lose half the value in the collector marketplace.
and they're in the back of my trunk 'cause I'm about to bring them to a Japanese buyer.
he's a huge Elvis fan.
wait a second. You You deal with Megan?
Yeah, man. She called to say she's gonna hand-deliver the prints.
I didn't ask any questions. I just paid her price.
that's why Dave turned on the dime with a confession
he realized that she had slipped out while he was sleeping on the couch.
mama, what are you doing here?
we got to get ready for the parole hearing.
I'm not gonna go.
what are you talking about?
I knew about the money, Dwight.
what?
I knew your daddy was on the take.
back in your daddy's day, all cops had to accept payoffs.
what, did they put a gun to his head and force him to be on the take?
it was the culture back then.
if a police officer didn't take a payoff, his fellow officers just didn't trust him.
all these years, you hid this from me.
I don't believe your daddy was a dirty cop.
but you just said he was taking payoffs, mama.
he may have taken them, but he never spent the money.
come on, mama.
what, did we have a big, fancy house or drive new cars and go on lavish vacations?
no, we didn't, but... Did we?
no, he took the money to keep us safe, to fit in, and he did not spend it.
damn it, mama, you still should have told me.
Dwight Hendricks, do not curse at your mother.
look, what were you trying to protect me from?
that That dad wasn't the man I thought he was?
you know, you're asking all the wrong questions on this trip.
what? It doesn't matter if dad was an honest man, a good cop?
well, of course it matters. That's what I'm telling you.
I believe he was a good, honest man.
in spite of the facts?
you know, what truly matters...
is what you carry with you about your daddy...
in your heart.
Mrs. Hargrove, this is your husband's signed confession for assault and arson.
you gonna let him go to jail for your crimes?
we understand the financial strain y'all have been under.
and, Megan, a judge will understand that you are not a bad person.
you might want to take one last look,
I'm begging you, don't say anything.
you don't want to play that game.
you fight this, everyone's gonna lose.
Bryan has agreed to drop the assault charges.
and because you haven't tried to file a claim on the Elvis movies, no insurance fraud has been perpetrated here.
you'll be charged with reckless endangerment.
you play ball with us, we can help you.
we'd put so much into the theater and gotten so far behind on our house payments, and you wouldn't listen to me about selling the Elvis prints.
what did you do?
you always told me, if there was a fire, that the prints would be safe in the storage closet.
and I hoped it would work in reverse...
keep the theater safe, but, obviously, it didn't.
I'm so sorry, Dave.
I was just trying to save a little piece of our dream. I know you'll never be able to forgive me.
darlin', I already have.
I already have.
thank you for allowing me to speak.
I've written something that I wanted to say, but...
now that I'm here...
I-I've made a huge mistake.
I-I carried around the memory of my dad's murder for 31 years...
when what I should have been carrying around was the memory of his life.
the story of my dad's life isn't how it ended.
it's how he lived it.
my dad was the greatest dad a boy could ever have.
and that's the memory I'm gonna carry with me for the rest of my life.
I'm not gonna carry Tim Mason with me any longer.
neither me or my mom will stand in the way of Mr. Mason's release.
thank you.
congratulations, detective.
job well done.
told you I was a good cop.
I never doubted you were a good cop.
you sure about that?
I just wanted to make certain the good cop showed up for work every day.
fair enough.
also, I'll admit it now , This investigation was a test.
but not for you , For me.
you know, the only thing so much sitting behind that desk does is give me a big butt.
you want my opinion?
you passed the test with flying colors.
job well done.
one, two, three...
you guys gonna audition for my talent show?
let's drive to elmo.
uncle ned!
you came home!
I just want to go back to the way we were.
I don't think I can go back.
Hey, jack, jack!
look what the dog did.
Oh, just shoes.
"just shoes"?
it's the new zen me.
I don't get attached to material possessions.
Oh, so now you want make-up sex?
whoa, there, buddy.
we've got to get him fixed.
Yeah, yeah, I know, but...
you're gonna wince every time I say it.
I can't help it. I'm a guy.
Oh, he'll be fine.
these, I'm not so sure about.
but again, whoares? Not me. Want to know why?
you're zen?
zen and feeling flush.
I just received a check for the final delivery of my book.
which means I can buy two new pairs of shoes I won't get attached to.
heck, make it 20.
and 40 new flannel shirts for you!
Thanks, but, uh, no guy needs that much flannel.
okay, then, how about sweaters? Jackets?
Mukluks for every day of the week?
you name it, it's yours.
this is more than I made all year.
I ought to get into the relationship-book game.
it sure pays better than the wild-game... game.
congratulations, stud.
I guess that makes three studs in our house.
though, uncle ned... not for long.
you're cutting me off.
Yeah, unless you pay your tab.
well, I thought we had an understanding.
you're not allowed to cut me off until I'm too drunk to notice.
Jerome, I need you.
Oh, if I had a nickel for every time a lady's said that to me.
you'd have a whole five cents.
could you please open the post office for me?
sorry, it's closed, due to the fact that the postmaster is really enjoying his beer.
Oh, come on.
I just got paid for my book, and I want to send the check off to my bank.
must be a big chunk of change if you're in such a hurry.
how much is it for?
that is private information.
more than a hundred bucks?
of course it's more than a hundred.
she wrote a book, not a fortune cookie.
so, what -- a grand?
Oh, can't be more than a grand.
I mean, let's face it, she's no robert ludlum.
for your information, it is a lot more than a grand.
more than 10 grand?
it is none of your business.
damn. She's loaded.
how does jack feel about your big windfall?
Oh, he was happy for me.
Oh, you don't say.
cause most guys aren't too keen on the idea of a woman making more than they do.
Oh, in 1950, maybe.
Yeah, jerome. Get with the times.
I mean, dick wouldn't mind if I made more than him. Would you?
of course not.
though that would never happen since i am your superior.
well, that's just a title.
and a paygrade.
and I have three more slashes here, so...
well, I own the elmo inn.
that's a whole other source of income your slashes have nothing to do with.
I, of course, would love to have a sugar lady.
then I wouldn't have to worry about how I'm gonna pay my tab.
no, then i wouldn't have to worry about how you're gonna pay your tab.
point is, if marin would like to pay my bill, she'd be more than welcome.
Oh, marin declines, but thank you for the offer.
am I mistaken, or did all of you sign up for the talent show?
Yeah. - Yeah!
that's right. A talent show that's happening in two days!
official rehearsals started an hour ago, am I the only person who cares ouputting ona professional production?
listen, red, there's no need to get so worked up. It's just a little show.
L-little show? Little show?
chief celia, there are no little shows, only little performers with little talent...
and little chance of getting their sound cues right!
someone needs a little drink.
since this morning was a complete wash,
I'm just going to start with this afternoon's schedule.
Lonnie, you're at 1: 00.
Marin, theresa, and sara are at 2: 30.
Hey, what are you girls doing, anyway?
Oh, you're just gonna have to wait and see.
Dick the magician, 3: 45.
and celia -- she's agreed to serve as my lovely assistant.
uh, he means "magic facilitator'.
no, I mean "assistant."
I told you, I prefer "magic facilitator."
it's just a title. - Then change it!
just... be there on time.
and that goes for everyone.
if you're late, you're cut from the program.
Jerome, another sip of that beer, and you're not playing the piano!
promise?
there really is a nebraska. Who knew?
about two million nebraskans.
I just can't get over how open it is out here. And how green!
I thought you'd like this route to alaska.
and cows!
there really are cows!
just walking around. - I know.
only 1, 200 miles from new york.
it feels light-years away, huh?
Yeah, it does.
so, tell me, do these nebraskans have restaurants?
I'm famished. - Yep.
I know a spot 30 minutes outside omaha.
well, you, my darling, are a man with a plan.
a sexy man with a plan.
you're back!
rehearsals just ended.
don't worry. I'll cover the desk.
I just need a second.
well, uh, maybe this'll give you some energy.
a giant candy bar?
it's from a chocolatier in anchorage.
it's awesome, right?
I thought it was awesome.
and it won't go bad like the flowers.
well, I mean, if you don't eat it, after a while, it might get all chalky and whd e angross.
why are you doing this?
because I was looking for something as sweet as you.
Patrick, please.
I mean, even this huge candy bar is made of only semisweet chocolate.
you are 100%, full-throttle sweet.
I need you to back off.
Annie, give me a chance.
I'm sorry.
I know it's been awkward between us because of everything we've been through, but you're jt making it worse.
sometimes things have to get worse before they can get better.
Hello, annie.
it's time for dinner.
Ivan, not now!
Oh, yes. You're coming with me. - Ivan!
and then there was light!
and then there wasn't.
I think I have more in the basement.
I'm a man of mystery.
be right back.
Hello!
Hi, honey.
just wondering if you got anything big, fat, and juicy in the mail.
if you are talking about my wonderfully, deliciously juicy, big check, then, yes.
thank you, jane. I could not have finished the book without you.
I'll be accepting thank-you gifts when I get to elmo.
which is?
Oh, who knows? We're about to make a right at wyoming.
I hope you and jack are celebrating today.
Oh, yeah.
we're at his house right now, changing light bulbs.
geez. Pace yourself, honey. The night is young.
did you show jack the check?
of course. Why wouldn't I?
money's this weird thing between couples. You got to be careful.
why do you think I'm traveling cross-country in a motor home instead of flying first-class?
well, apparently everyone thinks that men are threatened by money.
well, it's tricky.
I may earn more than sam, but I want him to feel like he's in charge.
and, surprisingly, I like that he's in charge.
crap!
honey, what was that? - I have no idea. Let me call you back.
a pipe burst. - Oh, no.
this house is just one thing after the other.
maybe you should sell it.
you want me to sell my house?
well, you don't live here anymore.
Yeah, I know.
and things keep going wrong.
Yeah, that's true. It's just...
you know, not that I'm against it, I just never thought of it before.
so, what do you think now that you're thinking about it?
I guess, you know, it makes sense.
well, maybe you could find out how much it's worth, and then you could decide later.
Yeah. That's not a bad idea.
who knows? Maybe the new indoor swimming pool might just add value!
go ahead, dive in!
I am. I'm diving, I'm eating.
isn't this place amazing?
I never knew there were so many ways to stuff a potato.
that's potatoville for you. You name it, they'll stuff it.
I'm going potato chow mein next. You?
Oh, I'm not sure I'll be having a second. - What?
you can go up as many times as you want.
they will never kick you out.
right. The beauty of all-y-can-eat.
but I'm good, thanks.
Oh, wow, that's fully loaded, all right.
this place is really hard to beat, isn't it?
Plus, I have coupons. $3 off. A whole book of 'em.
lucky us. - Yeah.
I have mapped out our entire trip based on potatoville placement.
if things go as planned, we will save $86 on the course of this trip.
and have eaten 30 potatoes.
here's hoping.
I got you skim milk.
Oh, thanks. Hey, can you pick up matty from soccer later?
sure.
I should be wrapping up my research at dr. Harbeck's at 4: 00.
okay, great. I should be back here by 7: 00.
try not to be late.
I'm supposed to be at marin's by 7: 30.
I can't believe the show is tomorrow and we haven't finished our costumes.
I can't wait to see your big act.
okay see you later. - Wait!
aren't you forgetting something?
I've got my lunch and...
I meant a kiss goodbye.
Oh, right. See ya.
see ya.
sexier. Sexier.
then we go up.
come down here.
sexier. Move. Xier.
sexier. Got it.
okay, so, um...
uh, left, right, then hip...
Annie, put the pen down.
but how will I know what to do?
just follow me.
wait. Wait. What are you doing?
I push, you pull, I pull, you push.
I'm the man. I'm supposed to lead.
I-I'm trying! It's just...
I went to an all-girls catholic school, and I was always the man in all the dances.
and the musicals!
and the american revolution reenactments.
you should have seen my benjamin franklin.
well, let it go.
dance requires each of us to play very specific roles.
let me be your benjamin franklin.
okay. - See?
down.
Hey, what's going on?
harbor master forget to zip his fly again?
I wish.
are you okay?
I just can't believe annie's really going for a guy like ivan.
I mean, the way he bosses her around everywhere.
you're coming with me.
why would annie like someone like that?
well, sometimes it's nice to give up control and let yourself be led a little.
he's definitely in the lead, all right.
Bull's-eye!
and we're back!
up next, Elmo's one and only relationsh coach you know who -- right after this message.
and don't forget to check out Elmo's first annual talent show this saturday night.
singing, dancing, acting...
dancing.
you know, Patrick, Annie might just need a little time and space.
Yeah, that's what she said.
and the old old Patrick would give her that time and space.
well, okay, then.
Yeah, but I'm not the old old Patrick!
I'm the new old Patrick.
and the new old Patrick -- he's got a plan to get her back.
Really? What are you gonna do?
I'm taking control. Oh, no.
I can't divulge details.
let's just say, uh, the sky's the limit.
uh, Patr K... - and you're on the air!
Hey, Elmo.
my friend Patrick and I were just talking power dynamics.
from the earliest age, we grow up with them -- parent/child, teacher/student
but as we get older, relationships become more complicated, less easily defined.
we would like to imagine equality -- amongst friends, with spouses.
but are we just fooling ourselves?
you tell me, Elmo.
in the dance of life, is it possible to have two equal partners, or does someone always have to take the lead?
okay.
okay. Okay!
I've seen enough. What's the verdict?
this house has good bones.
once you fix the plumbing and you do some cosmetic surgery, this could be a huge seller.
Hey, that's great.
what would that entail, exactly?
well, the whole place needs a good steam clean and a fresh coat of paint.
and you need some new fixtures because fluorescents scream psych ward.
and the front needs facelift -- new paint and landscaping.
it's all about curb appeal.
we don't have curbs in elmo.
doesn't matter. Curb appeal, curb appeal, curb appeal
that's six words you should never forget.
we'll keep that in mind.
well, I got to run. Buzz is waiting to rehearse with me.
he needs the practice more than I do, trust me.
let me know when you're ready to sell.
okay, okay.
so, what do you think?
uh, well... it's a lot to take on.
my plate's so full with work and teaching at the university.
maybe we could do the whole "selling the house thing" in the spring.
it's mind-blowing.
cytoplasmic patterns can vary quite distinctly from one disease to the next.
and yet, they're similar enough to make for a difficult diagnosis.
which is where we come in.
well, you, but, thanks.
Oh, sara, I -- I read an interesting case file last night in the new england journal of medicine.
I'd love for you to take a look.
great.
then come get it.
come on, sara. You know you want it.
Sara? Do you... want it?
I cannot believe we have 24 hours to get these costumes made and on us.
now, is this the fabric we're using for the bodice? - Yeah.
it's a little more revealing an I thought.
Oh, I knew uncle ned was up to no good earlier.
I hope he is enjoying his little walk with jack, causecome tomorrow, he is going to be singing a much calmer and higher tune.
I'm taking him to the vet before the show.
Oh, hello? What's with the absent fire staring?
uh, sorry.
I was just, uh, just thinking about this weird daydream I had today...
about Dr.Harbeck.
weird how?
weird as in, he took off all his clothes like a chippendales dancer.
Oh, really?
paging Dr.Harbeck. Someone's got a fever!
is that a microscope in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?
it's not funny, you guys.
no, it definitely is.
totally funny. - I'm serious.
I feel guilty.
Why? Because you think Dr. Harbeck's hot?
no, because I'm fantasizing about him and not about Eric.
so what?
well, don't you think that is weird?
No! It's perfectly normal.
it's just an innocent little fantasy.
unless you're thinking about acting on it. - Yeah.
No! I love Eric.
he's great around the house. He's great with Matty.
he was great in bed... from what I remember.
Oh, so, uh, you have desexualized him.
the next time your mind wanders into chippendale terrain, just consciously put Eric there.
that might be hard to do.
it's hard to imagine Eric stuffing singles in his collar.
Hey, Ben. How 'bout a beer?
what about me?
what about you?
you won the girlfriend lottery.
you're not gonna use part of your jackpot to buy your buddy a beer?
that's not how it works, Jerome.
Oh, what's the matter? Marin hasn't dished out your allowance yet?
he's just busting your chops.
well, keep busting. I'm happy for Marin.
she worked hard for what she got.
so, you're trying to tell us that you don't care one little bit that your girlfriend is making more money than you are?
Nope.
doesn't matter who makes more money as long as everybody's happy.
says the man who buys his wife a jeep to get out of the doghouse. - Yeah.
Oh, no, you are in a delicate situation here, Jack.
you see, a relationship is about power.
Yeah, yeah, women have their say, but the man has to have control.
look, I'm in control.
which is why Marin's got you selling your house.
I'm not selling my house. Never planned to.
that's not the word on the street.
look, I had some problems with my place, but it's my place, and that's not gonna change.
marin suggested I sell it, and instead of getting into an argument,
I let her get a professional opinion.
let her. - Yeah.
and then she saw what a pain it was to sell it, and she backed off.
it's called subtlety.
all right, Ben, let me get the next round.
on me, not Marin.
all right, who wants to play some pool?
told you I could work one out of him.
toll road should be coming up soon.
you don't have any change, do you? Looks like I'm a quarter short.
Sam! What is all this doing in my purse?
well, you didn't eat very much before, so I figured, you know, in case you got hungry...
if I get hungry, we can just stop somewhere else.
sure, but not for 200 miles.
that's where I have my next coupon.
see, if you look at my map...
I get the whole thrifty thing, but, honey, we can afford to not use coupons once in a while.
if dinner costs an extra $3, so be it.
that's silly. Why would we spend an extra $3 if we don't have to?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe if someone's not in the mood for their 24th potato!
you know, they also have soup at potatoville.
the point is, together we earn a decent amount, so we don't need to count every single penny all the time.
we can afford to splurge a few dollars here and there.
but there's no reason to.
as my dad always used to say, "good 'cents' should always prevail."
and that's c-e-n-t-s.
Oh, come on, sam.
lighten up, live a littl buy yourself a steak.
go over the speed limit. Turn on the air-conditioning.
that would be like throwing money out the window.
Yes, but it won't kill you.
it can be freeing!
see? We're fine! It's not the end of the world!
Oh, you are not seriously going out there to get that.
you better believe I am!
Hey, what's going on?
fixing the pipes and the floor.
should be a couple days, a week, tops.
I didn't hire anyone to fix the pipes.
a, uh, a Marin frist did.
okay.
don't you worry -- we'll get this all fixed up for you, Mr.Frist.
just leave it.
you don't have to be such a...
go ahead, say it.
the type of person who is tight with their wad.
and you don't have to be such a spender.
look, don't make me feel bad for stopping to pick up a dollar.
it's who I am.
well, who you are can change a little because I make a pretty sizable living.
we just don't need to scrounge.
this isn't about how much money each of us make.
found it.
make sure the sun's high enough!
O-okay, annie. A little higher.
Annie, I need you outside immediately!
I-I'm busy right now.
no, no, no, this is serious. It's...
I really don't have time for this.
the show is just a few ho- - well?
I 'heart' assie? - What?
Oh, no! No, buzz made a mistake! He flipped the n's!
Patrick, even if this were right, it isn't going to get us back together.
Yeah, but it's supposed to say "annie." " I love you, annie"!
you can't see it now! Here, listen...
lunch is just about ready.
okay.
here it is, nice and spicy -- just the way you like it.
Sara? You ready?
sure.
this is what I was afraid of.
this is exactly what I was afraid of.
the money thing rearing its ugly head, and now we have to live the rest of our lives in uncomfortable silence.
what do you want me to say?
look, I completely respect and love you, but I'm scared that if you know how much I have in the bank, n't feel l like a man, or you'll think I don't think you're a man, which isn't the case at all. It's just...
I make more than you.
there, I said it, and we both know it's the elephant in the room, but there's just not room for you, me, and this elephant in the RV.
even though you did rent a sizable RV.
Jane, I have a lot in the bank, too.
of course, honey, I'm sure you do, but perhaps your version of "a lot" is a bit different from mine.
you'd be surprised.
go ahead. Write down your number.
Sam, this is silly. We don't have to do this. I have enough money.
let's just leave it at that.
and I have enough, too. Now write.
see what I mean?
go ahead. Take a look.
pardon me for asking, but...
how did you do this?
you're a spender, I'm a saver.
I'm just... in awe.
Jane, I'm not thrifty because I need to be.
I'm thrifty because I want to be.
it's a philosophy.
see this place?
for 12 years, I've wanted to live there with you.
you didn't know me 12 years ago.
I could dream, couldn't I?
and thanks to my thrifty ways, I can afford to buy that place.
my man with a plan.
Hey, I didn't think you were coming!
what were you thinking?
what do you mean?
I thought we were on the same page about ned's neutering.
I'm talking about my house. You paid for a plumber and a handyman?
you said you didn't have time to work on it, so I hired some guys to do it for you.
I was just trying to help.
I don't need your help.
you can keep your money and your plumbers.
need to fix my house -- I can fix it myself.
you don't have to fix uncle Ned, either.
he's right. Come on, let's go.
energy! Fantastic. Absolutely. I-I thought he was real.
M-mai, do you have everything you need?
I'm trying not to strain my voice.
okay.
uh, Annie?
I'm sorry about before, but the letter "n" can be a little tricky when you're skywriting.
it's okay. I'm sure nobody saw it.
Hey, assie!
can we get some more water back here?
Annie, have you seen Marin?
No! But I'm sure she'll get here.
it'll all be okay.
somebody's had an attitude adjustment.
well, before, I was driving myself crazy with all the details, but I've realized, you don't always have to be in charge.
does a certain hockey player who lives in my house have anythinthing to do with this?
I -- I just feel really safe with him -- the way he takes control.
it's nice to let go for a change.
good for you.
if you see Marin, tell her we're waiting for her.
right. For the last time, I am not wearing that!
for the last time, this elevates it from a kids' act to adult entertainment!
Yeah, the kind people would watch on cable at 2: 00 A. M!
I'm sure whatever you choose will be beautiful - put it on. Please. - I'm not wearing it.
no. It's ridiculous. - Just do it.
guys, I'm sorry I'm late.
everything okay?
well, it was until I realized that I was completely wrong about Jack!
what about?
well, he advised me to keep my money to myself. His words.
Ouch. - Oh, yeah.
and then he grabbed uncle ned and stormed out of the vet's.
so I don't know where he is or even if he's coming to the show tonight.
you guys will work it out.
Yeah, I hope.
I had no idea money was such a big deal with jack.
it's about more than money!
it's about balls.
his and the puppy's.
when you stepped in and fixed everything, you became the man of the house.
she's right. You took the power.
now he's just trying to get it back by keeping hihouse.
and uncle Ned's nads.
he doesn't need to keep the house to be the man.
well, maybe we're all wrong about this, and Jack is keeping his place because he's got concerns about us.
I doubt that.
he's your boyfriend but he's also a guy, and guys need their space.
think about it -- you live and work in your house.
maybe Jack needs a place of his own nearby, you know, a cave to retreat to.
five-minute warning.
abracadabra.
Abracadabra!
and... voil?
and now for my final trick.
I will boldly escape from these torturous cuffs, padlocked behind my back by none other than my lovely assistant.
magic facilitator. - Key!
say it!
just give me the key!
how 'bout a hand for my beautiful magic facilitator, Ms.Celia bachelor?
I just want to thank you all for coming and, uh
Patrick, what are you doing? - I just...
uh, hello out there.
I'm sorry for the, uh, surprise appearance.
I -- I know I'm not part of the program, because I was out of town for the auditions.
but I do have an act, though, so, uh...
here goes.
Oh, no, Annie, stay.
you're part of the act.
"lost & found" by patrick o'bachelorton.
it was over a year ago I met a girl who put my head into a swirl.
I knew right then it was love at first sight, and then grew that love into something bright.
lucky for me, she loved me back right up through my lightning attack.
but memories lost left me a blank slate, and she could no longer participate.
and now I'm back, and I wake up needing her each day, wanting her to remember and love me the same way.
will you marry me... again?
marry me?
no.
did -- Did you really mean what the poem said?
do you really love me in all those ways?
of course.
then you want me to be happy, right?
Yeah, Annie. That's all I want.
then leave me alone.
if you really love me, please, leave me alone.
you were incredible.
I couldn't... I couldn't take my eyes off you.
you were amazingly hot.
so were you. - Really?
marry me.
Yes.
Hey, that was great, coach. - Thank you.
listen, uh, I want to apologize. I overreacted at the vet.
well, I shouldn't have called the plumber.
it wasn't my place.
no, you were just trying to help.
why didn't you just tell me you didn't want to sell tse?
hou I mean, if you're worried about us
Marin, I love living with you.
well, I love living with you.
but that doesn't mean that someday we won't love living with each other.
well, that's not something I'm planning for.
I didn't want to sell the house because it's a part of me.
I got a lot of memories attached to it.
I don't know, I guess there's a part of me that...
wants a room of your own.
Yeah.
you're, uh, you're very sparkly.
we are the daughters of the feminist movement, taught from an early age that nothing can stop us, that we can rise as high and achieve as much as any man.
and in some ways that's true.
we have taken great strides, stepping over traditional gender roles, and going after -- and getting -- exactly what we want.
but part of being powerful is knowing when to take the backseat...
you ready?
one second.
and look at life from another perspective.
imagine how many condiments I can fit in this bad boy.
because the thing is, in a relationship, there is no C.E.O.
it's a delicate dance, a push and pull, a back and forth, an up...and down.
but we endure...
because at the end of the day, we don't want to go it alone.
and when we find someone -- a partner
we compromise, loving everything we can and putting blinders onto everything else.
because love isn't perfect, but it's the really great and perfect love that keeps us evolving, happy.
and in the end, isn't that what life's all about?
I'm planning a reception to celebrate marriage to a man we i can't
I'm with jack now.
you're not mom mom, mom
can -- can you hear me?
I-I-I-it's m it's patrick.

she's a tough to crack.
but whenenhroughghshell, she's all sweet meat.
Deshe is indeed.
that's why you, sasast the guy.
you're the nutcracker.
my mother prides herself ability to read peopl do, but come on he went up in a lawn chair.
he didn't hurt anybody.
Oh, really? What does this look like, a necklace?
t mean for that to happen.
it's not about intent.
resisting arrest, criminal mischief, eneny theft.
what?
that was mymyir.
Oh, come on, C.
let the boy go.
he's sorry.
Oh, he is? - yeah oh at's funny. I-I never heard him apapap

you really shohobutt out of this.
just cost.
F-for everything?
mental distress, and medical bills?
cause this brace -- not cheap.
uh, no, just the bail.
Oh, uh, well, you know, then bail, including the fines, is gonna -
ll, that's gonna run you...$2000
You'e kidding me, right?
Oh, good. I caught you.
Patrick won't be joining you on the radio today.
why not?
didn't you hear? - What?
Celia arrested him and now she's going to make him sit in his cell alone all weekend.
I feel so bad for him.
Patrick's in jail?
all he wo was fln chair.
but celiajunderstand that.
then again, it probably doesn't help that patrick's taken a vow of silence, which, for the record, I totally respect.
Patrick has taken a vow of silence?
he's proving a point.
and the point is?
I'm pretty sure it's the "what's the point of talking to my controlling mother if my corolling mother isn't going to listen anyway" point.
classic.
I just wish I could help him and make it better, you know, as -- as a friend.
but how can I if he can't even say what he wants?
Hey, guys.
my friend annie and I were just talking, as women do, and we got to wondering -
how can you really ever knowere coming from?
people say it's important to listen, but how can you listen if nothing is being said?
tell me, elmo -- in a relationship, remain si
you are gonna love it.
there is this little kosher hot dog stand right outside my old apartment.
Oh, it is so good.
als the pumpkin muffins delnow, ttastic.
what? K about food is making me hungry.
Oh, I get these pork buns down on canal street.
they're the perfect blend of sweet and salty.
you're gonna love new york.
excuse me.
Yeah, well, bueno
Noan do.
to cocoon myself, especially when I'm at rcy of an unknown being especialmente cuando estamos flying me 40, 000 feet in the air.

to help you sleep.
Thanks.
you smell good
go nope, that would be me.
lavender calms the nerves.
glad to see it's working.
by the way, if we die up there, I just want you to know...
I love you like I would my own son.
I love you, too, like I would my son'S...
annoying girlfriend.
hunger strike i get it, gandhi.
music preference?
1) oldies, but 2) jailhouse rock 3) where are they now?
we're in this together.
excuse me.
can I get a scotch?
make it a double.
since when do youdrink scotch?
Siyor my drinking?
what is going on with you?
nothing. I'm just
I'm sorry. I'm just tired.
well, yeah, that's because you haven't been sleeping since we moved in together.
and every time I ask you why, you just want to have sex.
and that's bad?
well, it is if there is a reason behind it.
I feel like there's something you're not telling me.
maybe you think we moved too fast.
if this isn't working for you, tell me.
it's working for me.
how are your vows coming?
fine, I guess.
you guess?
why exactly is there guessing?
uh...I kind of have trouble writing down how I feel.
I'd rather speak from the heart.
you know, on the spur of the moment.
Oh, sam, really.
you know, this doesn't have to be hard.
after we write them, we can try them out on each other.
since I already wrote mine, how about I go first?
fine.
shoot.
Sam, I used to think the miracle was that I found you.
but that wasn't it.
Theurred soon after.
the day I stopped worrying...
okay.
stopped worrying about anything
because I knew that everything would be okay
as long as...
o-kay.
just as long as we had each other.
guess who married a weeper?
so he cries a little. Is that so bad?
trust me.
there's no spinning this.
Sam is a full-on, hyperventilating, kleenex-clutching crier, complete with...snot.
well, I think it's sweet.
well, everything but the snot part.
I nixed the public vows.
when I was first married, I was a lot like jane.
not in touch with my emotions.
I've been a believer ever since.
Essing emotionsis a good thing.
Yeah. You should be thankful.
I wish jack would show someen, any emotion at all.
lately, I have no idea what is going on with him.
well, unless we're in bed.
that's a step in the right direction.
sex is just another way people connect.
it's highly communicative.
see, honey, you just have to read between the sheets.
give him time.
words usually follow.
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
I invited some business contacts to the party, you know, with the write-off.
anyway, stuart's coming...solo.
as hope that's t gonna be weird for you.
why would that be weird for me?
my relationship with stuart is strictly business.
in fact, we're meeting at the boathouse for lunch some new projects.
why, thank you.
and thank you.
all right, jerome, we're getting dressed.
time for you to go.
fine, but these eyebrows aren't exactly gonna wax themselves, you know.
I brought you a blow-up pillow for your underdeveloped es.
caught you!
morning, o'donnell.
chief celia, I-I was just about to go -
I hope you realize you're officeaking and entering.
that's 48 hours mandatory jail time around here.
okay!
or not.
a-are you sure?
cause it seems like you have to, you know, according to the law.
or maybe we should call supervisor dick and ask him what to do.
fine.
I got my eye on you, o'donnell.
the slightest infraction and you are outta here.
you -- you spoke.
Yeah.
Stuart, I'm not sure I'm in the right place.
I'm in the park near the restaurant , but I don't see you.
turn around.
I thought we were having a business meeting.
we are.
step into my officE.
your office?
sure.
well, my weekend office.
so, what did you want to talk to me about?
well, there's been some interest in launching an interactive relationship game based on your next book.
and here I've been trying to dispel the myth that games work in relationships.
on this one, the heroine makes her way through the wilderness to find her perfect man.
does she find him?
well, she's based on you, so you tell me.
well, in that case, yes.
I'm with jack now.
we're actually living together.
Really?
I thought he was at sea for nine months.
hed to be.
they got caught in a storm and were lost at sea for five days.
we thought he was dead.
Marin, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
he's been through a lot.
well, it sounds like you both have.
Jack's a lucky guyto have you to come home to.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous.
Oh, what if I said jealousy doesn't look good on you?
I'm sorry. I'm just speaking my mind.
always have.
we all have faults.
I guess that's mine.
it's not a fault.
hope I'm not interrupting nothing.
so, what do you think?
is -- is mary alice gonna find this dapper or...
desperate?
uh, I don't know.
you got a rabbit under that hat?
come on.
I'm trying to make a good impression he.
help an old bachelor out.
desperate.
way to shoot a guy down.
what's that?
a little something I wrote for my lady.
a love letter?
something like that, yeah.
so, you're serious?
love is a serious matter, jack.
how did you do it?
well, I just -- I got a pen and some paper no, no, not that.
I mean, how did you...
U know, I mean, how do you pour your he that?
I don't know.
it just comes to me.
maybe those fancy greeting-cardcompanies are right.
ma realize how much someone means to you, you want to share yourself with them.
Yeah.
I don't know how goo but...
I'm hoping'll do the job.
Oh, hey, theresa? - Yeah?
I'm on call for t today.
if I get paged, I might have to leave.
that's fine. We should have it covered.
I mean, the fight will be on soon, so ben's not going anywhere.
Hey, buzz, how's patrick holding up?
well, as well as you can when you're starving and locked up with your mother.
Oh, so not good.
I wanted to get him out of there, but who ts bail at $2, 000?
and then what kind of a woman refuses to give me the money to help her stepson out?
well, the upside is patrick's more likeou than you thought.
Yeah, now both of you have been arrested by celia.
Yep, he's got that.
Hey, guys, the fight's starting.
Hey, you still believe in those 20-1 odds?
Yes, sir.
prove it.
Oh, I'm gonna feel really bad taking your money.
don't.
winner takes all.
didn't you promise mai you wouldn't gamble anymore?
what mai doesn't know won't hurt her.
whip him, baby!
beat him like a rug!
just whip him!
are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
did you get any sleep this afternoon?
Jerome came by.
then he wouldn't leave.
and then I couldn't get to sleep after that.
honey, help.
what can I do?
if this thing creeps up any higher, they'll be rezoning this block as a red-light district.
I'll see you later. - Yeah.
she says it hurts, but she won't tell us where.
she was playing one minute, and then, out of nowhere, she started wheezing.
I think she's having an asthma attack.
we should take her in in case it escalates.
Jennifer, did you start to feel sick when you were playing?
yeah?
what were you playing with?
Jennifer, will you do me a favor?
will you put your head back?
okay.
I think we found our culprit. Take a look.
well, the upside is we can take care of this here.
but the downside is your daughter seems to have a reasonably sized green marble up her nose.
Jack, hey.
Stuart. - Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I remember.
two scotches in.
how's new york treating you?
well, I still have my wallet, so that's saying something.
you must still be jet-lagged.
I'm all right.
drink?
sure. Scotch.
good man.
so, marin told me about your sea adventure.
Oh, yeah.
it wasn't exactly an adventure.
well, it's quite a story.
you ever consider writing about it?
it's not a story, man.
it's my life.
Mary alice?
it's jerome. I thought maybe you got lost.
I know you live here and everything, but...
I-I see.
Hi. - Hey.
I can't believe you told stuart about what happened toto what?
what are you gonna do, publish a story in the new yorker about it?
no.
Jack, I hardly told him anything because I don't know anything because you won't talk to me about it.
it's not something I enjoy talking about.
Yes, I get that loud and clear.
you know, maybe I shouldn't have come on this trip with you.
maybe you shouldn't have.
you know, this weekend hasn't been too much fun fr.
and it should be.
my best friend just got married.
I know.
I can't do this right now.
you don't have to stay here for me, jack.
I'm in for two.
sucker.
this town needs another jail.
it's all there -- bail, fines, and any other ridiculous fee you included.
where did you get all this money?
let's just say I bet on the right guy.
Hey, thanks, dad.
goodbye, patrick.
wh-- what about me?
sorry, missy.
you're on your own.
I'll be back to visit.
you did good back there.
Sara, I'm john.
pleased to meet you.
how did you figure it out so quickly?
I have a kid.
at that age, anything that fits goes up their nose.
what do you got there?
my emt course books.
figure I should take advantage of the downtime on these rides to stay on top of things like septic shock.
what level emt are you?
Oh, I'm not an emt. I'm a doctor.
I didn't know doctors did ambulance runs.
Oh, I'm just volunteering.
the last couple of years, most of my work has been either in a lab or in my office.
clearly not with kids.
I just really miss treating patients.
that's why I like these runs.
they keep me connected.
are you okay?
Oh, yeah.
I see.
actually, my lady was supposed to meet me here tonight, but now she's not coming.
what changed her mind?
her husband.
he seems to think he loves her again.
apparently, bob -- that's the husband -
found all the love letters I'd been writing her these past months.
turns out that all the wonderful things I love about mary alice reminded him of all the wonderful things he loved about mary alice.
they're gonna give their marriage another try.
those must have been some letters.
Yeah, they sure worked.
just not fore.
one night would you like to dance?
as friends.
everything okay? - Yeah. why?
I saw jack leave.
he was really tired.
nothing more to that?
you know, I really don't feel like talking about it.
then we'll just dance.
you two better get to your vows before they close the bar.
you know, your guests are starting to skedaddle.
it's okay, daddy.
Sam and I decided not to do the vows anymore.
actually, sam's had a change of heart.
Hello?
Hi, there.
I'm gonna do something that might upset jane.
Jane and I were planning to read each other our vows tonight.
but we had a dry run yesterday that...
well, didn't end up so dry.
that's because I got emotional.
okay, I admit it. I cried.
like a baby.
truth is I don't know how not to get emotional when it comes to this woman.
Oh, sam.
everybody who knows jane knows she's smart, successful, maybe even that she plays a mean game of air hockey.
but what you might not know is that this same woman who tried to save you the embarrassment of me crying the same woman who empties her pockets for a street musician because she, too, believes in their dream, who leaves in the middle of the night to help her best friend fend off a bat, or was it a bear?
both.
you see?
that's my jane.
the woman I love.
and the truth is that's the reason why we eloped.
because I couldn't wait another day to call this woman my wif see, honey, I didn't even cry.
that was fun.
I really hope we work together again.
Yeah, me, too.
okay, it may not be as exciting as this, but I'm looking for a part-time research assistant.
Really?
it doesn't pay much, but there's the potential to learn a lot.
so in case you know anyone.
right, of course.
I'll put the word out at my next emt class.
I'm kidding.
no, it was meant for you.
no, I mean, let's face it, any woman who can study in the back of a speeding ambulance mu have pretty good reading skills.
I've been having these nightmares.
the guy, gary, that died, he was tied up to me and julia.
there was a -- a lot of blood.
his blood.
and we watched him.
we untied him.
and we watched him die.
and that's what I see when I'm sleeping.
I can't imagine.
I know.
I just -- I can't get my head around it.
I wish you had told me before.
I was, you know, trying not to think about it at first.
now it's all I think about.
I keep, uh, thinking that I could have done more.
I don't know how to move on.
Oh, jack, I am so sorry you went through that.
I wish I could really help you.
you are.
just being here.
but I wasn't there.
and this is really big.
I can love you, and I can tell you it's gonna be okay...
but you might want to talk to someone else, too, you know?
someone who...
knows how to handle this sort of thing.
as children, we're taught to express ourselves.
we're told to use our words...
to be specific...
and not to assume that others know how we feel.
because the truth is, it takes us saying things aloud to know what we need...
uh, hey, julia.
uh, I-I was hoping that you might have some time to talk.
to know what we feel ourselves.
as adults, there are those times when words fail us.
in times like these, we put our words away and show how we feel...
because actions speak louder than words.
and that saying a lot.
I've never d ethe guest-lecture thing before.
you're a natural.
they offered you a job?
you are a girl who is unforgettable.
I'm just not ready.
pilar Romero is one of the hottest self-help writers out there.
she's left her agency.
I want to work with your company.
I will require something else.
I want patrick to be my lover.
Hey, great sign.
so, can I count on you to audition?
Oh, Annie, I'd love to, but I am swamped.
if I don't make some serious progress on my book, Jane is going to end our friendship.
order's up, Marin -- two burgers, fully loaded, to go.
so, what's with this to-go business?
professor fancy-pants too good to eat with us?
Oh, come on. It's Jack's first lecture tomorrow.
he wants to practice.
buzz: Well, he should practice here. We'll heckle him real good.
Yeah, I don't think heckling is the point of the practice. Thank u for the burgers.
say "hi" to professor fancy-pants for us.
will do.
you sure? Okay.
so, you guys gonna audition for my talent show?
what about you, buzz?
after all, you helped me get back in touch with my love of theater.
maybe I will.
you'll do no such thing, Buzz Washington. You don't have time for talent shows.
you should be working as much as possible to make money as quickly as possible to get your wife o of my house, 'cause I swear, on my beloved grandma's beloved grave, if I see one more box arrive from knickknacksandnovelties. Com stuffed with packing peanuts,
I'm gonna lose what little sanity I have left, which is why I'm here, nursing my 12th can of cola.
by the way, Ben, can I get another, maybe with a lime in it?
sorry, Celia, I'm cutting you off.
you've clearly had enough sugar.
so, sometimes, on the lecture circuit,
I'd jump around like this before I got onstage to make myself feel loose.
gotcha.
want to try? Might help.
I'll pass.
okay. But this time, really think "loose.
got it -- loose.
loose.
recently, scientists have suggested "that the expansion of sea ice in the bering sea "during the neoglacial period may explain several unresolved phenomena...
okay, that's great. Great. Much better.
yeah? - Much.
but, remember, college kids get restless, so even more eye contact.
maybe look up like every third word.
right. Okay. - Okay.
phenomena that may include, "but are not exclusive to "the alteration of the distribution "of north pacific mammals, answering genetic questions.
okay, forget that.
the eye-contact thing is throwing you off a little.
I'm sorry this is taking so long.
you wanted to finish your chapter tonight.
why don't you work on your book? I'll be fine.
don't be silly. My schedule's flexible.
I'm that far from fine, huh?
it was so easy when I was just talking off the cuff in julia's class.
okay, so ditch the notes.
just talk.
what made humpback whale migration patterns change?
the climate cooled during the neoglacial period.
and...
the cooling created sea ice, so whales couldn't get through.
they had to take a detour, which explains why we find fossils where they shodn't be.
what? Yes, Miss Frist?
already, that is like a million gazillion times better.
million gazillion?
at the very least.
just talk like that. You will be fine.
Thanks, coach.
all right, I should probably get to bed.
I got to get on the road at 4: 00 A. M.
sleep well, professor fancy-pants.
would you stop calling me that?
well, I would be happy to confirm that reservation for you, but I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you that if you moved your honeymoon back three weeks, you'd be able to catch the elmo inn talent show, which is...
no -- no problem. We'll just stick with the original dates.
you're all set.
you're in this talent show, I hope.
uh -- n-no problem. Bye, now.
uh, uh, no, probably not, since I'm directing.
I have something for you.
but -- but it's not my birthday...
or my half-birthday.
go on, open it.
love presents.
it's the complete works of croatia's most famous playwright.
I thought it might inspire you as you undertake your theatrical journey.
thank you so much!
Annie, wait. One date -- just one.
I'm sorry, Ivan, but I-I'm just not looking to date right now, so, if there are strings attached to this book, I should probably give it back.
there are no strings, but I'm not going to give up.
I wish you would.
no, you don't.
Hey, this is Patrick.
you've reached the Elmo Inn, recently voted the best and only accommodations in Elmo.
we'll be back, so let us know who you are and where we can reach you.
Hey, this is Patrick.
you've reached alliance literary, recently voted, by me, the number-one place to work if you have to work.
Oh, hey, Judy.
Amy's in a meeting.
can I put you through to her voicemail?
you got it.
Patrick, can you come into my office, please?
sure thing, boss. Over and out.
Thanks.
and, again, you don't have to say "over and out.
Roger dodger.
or "roger dodger.
copy that.
come in.
what can I do you for?
have a seat, Patrick.
your breakfast sandwich didn't come with ham instead of sausage again, did it?
my breakfast sandwich was fine.
and, again, I'm sorry for overreacting yesterday.
Oh, hey, no, that was a totally normal reaction...
for a crazy lady.
the truth is, Patrick, you've been doing a great job here
so great, I'm about to give you a very special assignment.
no way. - Way.
now, as you know, we're looking for a big publisher for Pilar Romero's new book.
book's gonna be huge.
I agree, which makes ms. Romero a very important client.
and I am assigning you...
to be her personal liaison.
come on. High five!
okay.
so, what does a liaison do, exactly?
I mean, besides liaising, which I totally get... kind of.
scheduling, press, publicity -- it all goes through you.
anticipate her needs...
whatever they may be.
you got it.
you are not gonna regret giving me this assignment.
I'm gonna be all over pilar romero.
well, sure. That would be fine.
julia: Bad girl. You're a very bad girl.
bad, bad girl.
stop. No. Bad, bad girl.
Hey, I'm glad to see you talking to puppies and not students.
you mock, but office hours don't sound much different.
Oh, how did your lecture go?
I'm so sorry I missed it, but I was
Oh, no, stop! No. No.
lecture was fine. What's with the puppies?
Gary's dog gave birth.
she's pregnant? - Yeah.
I found homes for three of them, but these four are left, and I can't keep them 'cause jim does his sculpting from home, and with the buzz saw going, it's just too dangerous.
so I thought my students might want them, but apparently, there's a "no pets" rule at the dorm.
I'm just at my wit's end, Jack. I don't know what to do.
bad girl!
one quicquestion. - Shoot.
are you out of your mind?
four dogs?
just untilwe find them a home.
didn't knowwhat else to do.
well, why did youhave to do anything?
Jim works out of his home.
he has all tse buzz sawslying around, which are dangerous.
Yeah, what aboutmy sharpened pencils?
they can be dangerous, too.
sharpened pencils?
seriously, what were you thinking?
they're gary's dogsthat are...
so I guess I felta little responsible.
I get it.
I can help out... temporarily.
you're the best.
Oh, stop.
by "stop," I mean,"please, go on.
I'm sorry, but I just not surethat telling fortunes really qualifiesas a talent.
can you do it?
well, no, but - - exactly.
so this is how it gonna work
I'm gonna choose someonefrom the audience totally at random...
or a plant -- I haven't decidedwhich yet.
then I am going toblow that person's mind with myamazing predictions.

no, that's okay.

okay, choose a stack.
Ah, you're gonnafall in love.

Celia adopted an old, retire dpolice dog named wood ruff, who passed about 7 years ago.
she still hasn'tquite recovered yet.
Oh, that's too bad.
but I bet she'd nevergive up those precious years. So...
how about it? - Not on your life.
I can barely look after myself.
I'm sorry, but we're still struggling to paper-train Ivan.
okay.
do you know how much hard workpuppies are, hmm uh, yeah, I do, actually.
Oh, no, no! Stop! Stop! Cut it out, you guys! Sit!
you're all overthe place, Frist.
puppies respond toclear commands, repetition, and timely rewards.
okay. That's good to know.
these dogsneed boundaries, asap.
luckily, I happen to teachan obedience class, and I've gota spot available.
I thought you didn't like dogs.
I don't like to touch 'em. I love to teach 'em.
Oh, okay, well, I don't think I want to get involved indog school right now.
you'll unload 'em quicker if they're better behaved.
Marin, unless that's Jerome's, I'm gonna have toask you to leave.

Annie, sorry to interrupt, but I can't wait any longer.
I want you, my lite theater director, and I won't take "no"for an answer.
kiss her neck a lot.
it drives her crazy.

Oh, hello, puppies.
I don't suppose you want to adopt four puppies?

then again, I don't know what I want anymore.
is everything all right, Annie?
no. I had a... dream...
about Ivan.
so? - So?
I don't want some shirtless croatian running willy-nilly around my dreams.
shirtless, huh?
I am not ready for a relationship.
who said anything about a relationship? Have a fling.
No! This period of my life is not supposed to be about boys
it's supposed to be about theater.
well, the heart wants what the heart wants.
well, I refuse to accept that.
I will make mine want what I want it to want.
wouldn't that be nice?
uh, hey, Elmo, uh, Annie matters of the heart.
we all have emotional boundaries that we set for ourselves, but all too often, we cross them.
with authority and repetition, we can train animals to think and act a certain way, but how about when it comes to ourselves?
can we train our emotions to sit and stay?
how was your day?
long... but fine. You?
Oh, not bad.
got a bunch of e-mails from students today.
telling you how great your first lecture was?
asking for an extension on their first paper.
lots of grandmothers having surgery this week.
maybe I can use that excuse on Jane.
she gave me a deadline -- can you believe it?
you get deadlines all the time.
on magazine articles, not books.
books can't be rushed.
don't stress. You'll get it done, coach. You always do.
any breakthroughs today?
Oh, yeah, tons.
well, names.
well, flopsy, because of his ears, big paws for obvious reasons, sir pants-a-lot for reasons that become evident after he runs, and uncle Ned, because he looks like my uncle Ned.
of course.
can you take them to a training session tomorrow at noon?
Oh, shoot. I can't.
I got a meeting at ketchikan.
I could do it over the weekend.
the class is tomorrow.
it's fine. I'll just do it.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Julia.
um, you know, not bad. We're... holding up.
well, I'm -- I'm glad we could help.
here he is. It's Julia.
she can't find the gas bill.
Oh, hey, I mailed it.
I saw it sitting on the counter. I should have left you a note.
no, the puppies are doing great. It's no problem at all.
Pilar: Above all, be clear and direct in your interactions and never be afraid to let someone know that you're interested.
let's go get a drink.
this place is swarming with press.
in case you forget who anyone is, just give me the signal.
I got faces and names committed to memory.
additionally, most are wearing name tags.
how do you like your Martini?
Oh, I shouldn't drink... since I'm on the job.
what if I insist?
I guess, technically, I'd have to.
he'll have a Martini, extra dirty.
okay, then.
so, there are, uh, four publications you should sit down with before
Patrick, I don't want to talk about business anymore.
well, what do you want to talk about?
you.
not much to tell.
got amnesia a couple months ago, so you know almost as much as I do.
Oh, you poor thing.
tell me, do you think you'll ever get your memory back?
no one knows.
there's all kinds of strange cases out there.
sometimes, people just wake up and remember.
other times, a shocking event can jolt the mind back.
how about mind-blowing intercourse?
uh, Pilar, can I ask you a question?
I'm an open book, on sale next spring for $21.
right, well, I already read it, see, and you talk about the signs you send when you're trying to seduce someone.
like?
uh, talking about sex, making p-physical contact...
licking your lips to draw attention to your mouth.
are you hitting on me?
honey, if you have to ask, it's because I'm not being clear enough.
and she's presold all overeurope, latin America, and
sorry to interrupt.
can I talk to you for a second? - Of course. Will you excuse me?
is everything okay?
pilar is hitting on me.
that was the emergency.
I know that there is a strict company policy about remaining professional in the presence of authors, and you've given me this awesome opportunity that I don't want to mess up.
slow down.
are you attracted to her?
I'm not gay.
then go for it, honey.
W-what about the policy?
Oh, I think it's okay in this case, since you're part of the reason pilar signed with us.
what?
she told me she was hot for you, and I put you two together.
you pimped me out?
Oh, come on. You're single. She's gorgeous. What's the big deal?
the big deal is, I thought I got this assignment based on my merit, not on my looks...
which are apparently a lot better than I thought they were.
Hey, you. Come on. Come on, puppies.
you're late, Frist.
I'm the first one here.
because you're the only one taking the class today
doesn't mean you're not late.
no before we get started,
I like to take a moment of silence in honor of woodruff, a spectacular canine who served the public faithfully and devotedly until his untimely death.
all right, let's go. - All right.
now, do you know anyone, uh, maybe a student, who wants a dog?
always have a bag of treats handy to reward good behavior.
got it. - Let's see you walk 'em.
come on.
you're all over the place, frist.
no, get a tighter hold on their leaes. Choke up. No slack.
O-okay, okay.
walk slower.
don't let them walk in front of you.
okay.
keep a firm, steady gait. Stay in front.
pick up the pace if you have to.
remember, you're the alpha dog.
give those puppies a reason to respect you.
is this lesson for me or the dogs?
if you can't set boundaries, how are they supposed to respect them?
now make the dogs heel.
heel. Heel?
no, say it like you mean it. Heel!
impressive.
what are you doing here?
I just thought I'd swing by before my audition, see how you're doing.
practice, uh, walking the dogs.
come on. Come on, flopsy.
come on, flopsy.
I think flopsy really likes you.
no, that's 'cause I got a pocketful of treats.
Flopsy, come on.
so, do you want me to help you rehearse your act or what?
Oh, yeah.
okay, and for my finale, I am gonna pull a rabbit out of this totally empty hat.
see?
totally empty, right?
uh, r-right.
and yet...
voil?
no, I'm sorry. I'm just gonna hit the "pause" button.
this should just take a minute, okay?
sure. Take your time.
what are you doing here?
I want to audition.
t-to do what?
dance.
Ivan, I get that you like me, and I'm flattered. I am.
but I don't know how I can make it any clearer
I'm just not interested in you, and you're not interested in me, either.
I'm not?
you're an athlete. I'm a challenge.
it's what you thrive on.
th e reason I like you hasnothing to do with that.
it has to do with the kind of person you are.
and what kind of person is that?
the kind that celebrates half-birthdays.
can I audition now?
please, go.
don't make a mockery of my audition.
this is a serious theatrical undertaking.
Hey, stop! Peter cottontail! Peter cottontail!
thank you for not buying anything online in the last hour.
here. Have a cookie.
I mean it.
thank you for not buying any more porcelain dolls.
you're a very good girl.
if you think I'm a good girl for that, wait till you see the work I did on your garden.
what did you do?
Oh, just brightened the place up a little bit
pulled some weeds, planted some flowers.
Hey, can I get another cookie or what?
the ashes of my dog were here.
no problem. They're still here.
they're just all over.
I raked with my brand-new rake that I bought online for only $19. 99
I didn't want the ashes all over.
I wanted to be able to stand in this one specific place and know they were here.
Hey, I'm taking off.
can I ask you something, boss? - Yeah.
does this look silly?
well, um, you know, you're miming, so define "silly.
it's just...
Patrick and I would have done an act together, if he was here, a-and I was thinking maybe I'd do one alone.
go for it.
maybe I will. Thanks.
are you okay?
Yeah. Well, is there anything that I can do to help?
come in the box.
what? Oh, no, I can't. I'm not a talent-show guy.
just for a second.
Thanks.
I don't love being in the box alone.
well, the box can be a very lonely place.
I know.
but just because your box is lonely doesn't mean you should jump on the nearest hockey stick, right?
right.
but what if that hockey stick is more than just a regular hockey stick?
what if it's a sensitive hockey stick that -- that you kind of like?
uh, well, if, you know, you like the new hockey stick, go for it.
but what if, every time I use the new stick, I think of patrick?
when you're ready to let go, you will.
one tug-of-war? - Not a chance.
you're late. You said you'd be home by 7: 00.
I know. I'm sorry. Annie got upset. I was trying to help her.
Oh, of course you were.
what's wrong? - Nothing.
I'm glad you could be there for annie and for Julia.
maybe I should take a number.
what's going on?
it just seems like you have time for everyone but me.
well, what do you need?
help, Jack. I need help.
okay, okay. Give me the leashes. No problem. I'll walk the dogs.
I have to get some work done.
come here, boy.
Hey, come back!
Hey, come back!
the little one just jumped out the window.
well, of course he did! It's uncle Ned! He's a jumper!
that's why I leash them inside the pen. - I didn't know.
no, of course you didn't, 'cause you brought home four puppies, you dumped them in my lap, and left me to deal with all the mess.
Patrick, can I see you in here?
Yep.
great. Roger dodger.
I'm sorry.
I should've told you about pilar's intentions and let you make your own decision.
Yeah, you should have.
and whatever you do or don't do with pilar is up to you.
and if she has a problem with that, she'll deal with it, because you are more valuable to this company than she is.
don't you underestimate yourself, patrick o'bachelorton.
you're a lot more than just a pretty face.
you have transformed this office. - You don't have to say that.
I know I don't, but it's true.
office morale is better.
customer relations are better.
your color-coded post-it system is a real time-saver.
I didn't think you noticed.
Thanks, Jane.
uh, just to let you know, the deli didn't make a mistake this morning.
I told them to put ham in your breakfast sandwich.
I sort of figured.
mai feels really bad.
I just...
miss Woodruff, you know?
Yeah.
it's been hard for you lately, huh, with Patrick leaving.
I don't want to attach to anything anymore.
it's just too painful when it's gone.
what are you doing here?
I want to audition.
I deserve a shot.
fine. Dance.
I need a partner.
after this, I will leave you alone.
pinkie swear, no backsies?
I don't know what that means.
you promise?
I promise.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
I took years of dance in croatia.
it helps with the footwork on the ice.
so, am I in?
you're in.
uncle ned!
Jack: Here, boy!
Marin. - What?
we looked here an hour ago.
if you want to go home, go home.
uncle Ned!
I don't want to go home. I'm just saying it's been three hours.
Yeah, you're tired. I get it. No problem. I can deal with this, too.
come on. - What?
I get it -- you're mad. - Yeah, I am.
just so you know, writing doesn't get done by itself
it gets done because I get it done, after hours and hours of not getting it done, because writing is hard work!
I know that.
and just because I work from home doesn't mean I don't have a real job!
I never said it wasn't.
Yeah, well, then, why did you think it was ay to leave four dogs in my office?
that's not fair.
Oh, you want to talk about fair?
I had no idea you were so put out.
well, you should have thought about it.
I did -- that's why I asked you repeatedly if it was all right.
if you were so unhappy, why didn't you say anything?
I don't know.
uncle ned!
look, uh, I feel terrible about losing uncle Ned and about making you feel taken advantage of.
well, as a wise dog trainer once said, how can you expect anyone to respect your boundaries if you don't lay them out?
you're right. I said I was fine.
I don't usually say things are fine when they're not fine.
why did you?
I don't know.
I think, since you've been back, I've been so worried about your needs that I trained myself not to think about mine.
I had no idea.
well, how could you? I didn't say anything.
but this is your notice.
this girl's needs are about to be met.
fair enough. - Need number one...
shoot.
I know you feel this giant sense of responsibility, and I admire that -- I do.
but you can't be everybody's hero all the time, 'cause if you are, it leaves less of you available for me, and that's not fair.
because... you need me.
I do...
but not as a h o -- my partner.
okay. You got it.
I have thought about this a lot, and even though I am attracted to you
I'm attracted to you, too. - Right.
the thing is, we're working together, and I don't think it's a good idea to mix business with pleasure.
look, Patrick, I like you.
and, yeah, some of that is the raw animal instinct of having your face in between my breasts, but it goes deeper than that.
it -- it doesn't have to.
the men I me -- they're already damaged.
they have been cheated on. They have been dumped. They are transgendered.
but you -- you are a blank slate. - Yeah.
it's so refreshing.
but if you are intent on maintaining personal and professional boundaries,
I understand.
I am... so I quit.
let's get back to your place and do that breast thing.
sounds great.
Oh, wait, uh, I have to run to the bathroom. Don't move.
I mean, you can move, just don't go anywhere.
find a partner yet, old man?
just waiting on you.
enjoy the wait. It's gonna last forever.
Hey, professor fancy-pants emerges from his ivory tower.
I warned you. - You did.
uh, so you know, that colleague of mine who wanted one puppy next week
yeah?
I talked him into two puppies.
I thought you might want to say goodbye to big paws and sir pants-a-lot.
Oh, I'm actually gonna miss you guys.
Hey, where's flopsy?
come back in half an hour.
no can do.
why is that - - it's for you.
I don't want a dog. - Yes, you do.
loving anything or anyone is difficult and risky, but at the end of thday, it's worth it.
if you close yourself off, you might not be able to open up again.
so, what do you say?
will you keep flopsy?
his name is woodruff ii. All right.
give me a kiss. No, not you. You, stay.
stop jiggling it, patrick.
I got to get out of here!
Oh, my god! Annie's gonna forget about me.
no, she's not gonna forget about you. You matter to her.
you don't forget about the people you care about.
I love you, Annie.
Patrick, tag me in.
I will never quit. - It's okay, Patrick. We're a team.
will you please marry me?
Oh, my god.
I remember everything.
I got to get back to Elmo.
the mind is a funny thing.
it's the place from which everything emanates, yet no one can access anyone else's, which means we've got to communicate.
with animals, we use only the most straightforward language
words like "sit," "stay," "no.
but between one another, things quickly get complicated.
what we say is not always what we mean.
I knew this was a bad idea.
and at times, we have to fight through mixed messages...
Hey, this is Patrick. You've reached the Elmo -- ...
or start all over again.
Hey, there, this is Annie, and you've reached the warmest spot in the coldest state, the Elmo inn.
but no matter how hard it is and how often we feel misunderstood...
I'm so sorry. I got to go.
it is our responsibility to keep fighting for clarity, because, in the end, we teach people how to treat us...
which means the responsibility to communicate lies not on the shoulders of others but on ourselves.
uncle Ned!
you came home!
understand, Chapel. This is a very sensitive operation.
that island is considered a CIA asset.
I want those independent contractors believing they're liberating those people.
did you think I was gonna tell them they're risking their lives...
so that we can get rich off of diamonds and oil?
I need the best on this one and I need plausible deniability.
I shall give you the best.
Kruger and Dekirk.
munitions experts, South Africans. More specifically, Afrikaners.
there isn't a gun or a bullet they can't find or use.
five hundred kills to their credit.
lovely.
this is Mr. Samuel Kay.
mis and Al specialist.
fluent in nine computer languages.
can, or more precisely has, hacked his way into every system in the world...
including your own.
especially when you consider with whom they shall be working.
Maxine Barnol. Where hardware, hacking and bribery won't work...
you need a muse.
extraordinary.
Three-sixty, this is Blind Eagle. Do you copy? Yo, over.
Mr. Radio Jones...
communications specialist.
and the only person capable of talking Mr. John Seeger...
into joining our little party.
John Seeger.
the most decorated soldier in the first Gulf War.
he's a wild card, Chapel. - Yes.
the best at doing what he does.
will he know we're behind this?
only if you want him to.
just make sure you keep it under control, Chapel.
we don't need a war.
peace.
though you cannot see it, just over that hill a fierce battle has erupted...
sending civilians fleeing for their lives.
it's perfect.
Johnny, hotwire this piece of shit and lay a charge.
you rookies, it's time to show us what you're made of.
Jack a car in town and we move in on the target...
once she's clear, we go in with the truck.
do you think she's up to it?
if she doesn't call us after 5 minutes, we'll do it the old-fashioned way.
the children will be down in a minute.
please, get their breakfast ready on the table.
I'm taking the ambassador his coffee now.
I have an urgent message for the ambassador...
attention, invasion!
guys, we're all clear.
may I pour your coffee for you? - Yes, please.
you two, come with me.
come with me now. - It's okay.
Bonjour.
what are you doing here? - You know what I'm doing here.
your foreign policy sucks...
and we need you as insurance to get out of this mess.
I'm the French Ambassador! - I know who the fuck you are.
I'm running in a bit of a tight schedule, so let's move!
get up on the truck.
move!
get! Go on!
all right, get on the truck! It's not a fucking holiday!
move!
all right, let's move out!
we don't like to keep our friends waiting.
three days ago heavily-armed mercenaries...
launched a lightning raid overthrowing Sibi Al Fukar...
and his corrupt cadre of army officers...
who have held this tiny island nation in their iron grip...
for over three years.
with the surprise arrival of a brigade of French commandos...
these mercenaries have been dislodged from their positions around the city...
and put on the defensive, forced into a shrinking perimeter.
the French mass for a final assault...
these besieged Soldiers of Fortune now face a stark choice.
the inside of a French jail cell...
or death.
Colonel. Colonel.
Colonel, will you risk an attack even though...
the mercenaries have taken hostages?
Colonel, when do you strike?
they have nowhere to go.
we will overtake them but we'll have hostages to consider.
may I cross the line and talk to the mercenaries?
I understand what that means.
let her through.
who are you with? - Look like I'm with the mercenaries.
chief, I don't know where these numbers are coming from.
we're outnumbered. We're in trouble.
where are all these Frenchies coming from?
get Head Office on the secure line.
Where's Kruger?
he took the French ambassador and his family for insurance.
why'd you agree to work with a slap dick like that?
it wasn't my call.
come on!
let's move!
camera crew coming in!
Maxine, what are you doing here?
you're supposed to stay out of the danger zone.
gather intel only.
do you hear that?
how's this for intel? The French have landed.
somebody fucked us! Who?
radio.
give me that com une.
Damn!
Hello, Bravo! Bravo one-two-three!
do you copy?
got our employers on the line here.
it's time to throw our pride and call for help.
this is another CIA fuck you, isn't it?
Oh, right. I forgot. The creed.
care for no one and fight for everyone.
it's a good motto, isn't it?
sigma, this is Alpha Nine. I repeat, Alpha Nine.
do you read me?
sigma, this is Alpha Nine. Say again, Alpha Nine.
you guaranteed me this French fiasco wouldn't happen.
sigma, this is Alpha Nine.
you know, I think we're in a refund situation.
I make the check out to the CIA or to you?
it's your call on this one, Dresham. - Fuck you, Chapel.
it's a bit more from my mercs to handle.
shall we call in the troops?
those mercs, they figure out who they're working for?
and what difference does that make?
because right now we need deniability one piece. You understand me?
we're working the plan.
didn't you say there would be no counter-support?
can we expect any help from your end with our extraction?
you really want 'em back, Chapel? - No help at all.
you and Dresham fuck us on this...
I'm gonna stick my forty-five up your ass and break every bone in your body.
this is getting out of control. - You know something?
the next time that you and the agency want to plan a little business trip...
dial someone else.
fucking Yank.
excuse my language.
all right, Jones. Call in the chopper. Samuels!
load up all wounded.
send in a goddamned chopper now!
you'll never learn, will you?
who'd you think we were working for?
I'd settle for getting outta here.
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.
they used me to get a hold of you, man.
you hang on, son. I'm gonna get you on that chopper.
take care of Eddie.
hang on... Jones, you hear me?
Shondra... - Hang on, man.
promise me.
Tom! Tom!
move, move! Get the freak up. Let's go!
stand back! Don't move! - I'm press!
I'm press! You just killed an innocent man, asshole!
Colonel! This is Kruger. Come in.
Mr. Kruger.
there is nowhere for you to run.
now, listen up.
I got the French Ambassador and his lovely family here.
and the truck is rigged to blow. So stand the fuck down.
tell them to hold their fire.
repeat. Everyone, stand down.
pull forward!
don't give up.
Colonel, what the fuck are you doing?
repeat. Everyone, stand down.
on, my mark, get the fuck outta that truck!
now! Now! Get out!
go! Move!
keep moving!
come on, man, move!
this way. Coming!
move!
come on!
Hey, hey.
no worries, Johnny boy. We made it, didn't we?
I outta fuckin' kill you right now, boy.
I don't think so. - Yeah, maybe not right now.
I hear the blacks in the States fly really well.
why don't you and your buddy hop in the tail and fly the fuck outta here!
I'll fly on the tail...
if you don't mind me throwing this grenade up in this helicopter...
with you motherfuckin' white folks!
forget about it.
yo, Seeger, come on! We're full! Leave him. We're full, man!
come on, let's get the fuck outta here!
come on!
come on!
let's go! Let's go!
Maxine?
she'll play it through. She always does.
come on. Go. Too slow.
come on. Go.
Oh, yeah. We gotcha now.
today, Galmoral was turned over to the UN by the French ending...
a conflict which began as a small coup by antigovernment mercenaries...
now celebrated as heroes here.
this small island nation has its first taste of freedom...
in over one hundred years and democratic elections have...
you were correct. One week and he shows.
guess you know him well.
take him.
meet me back at base.
take him? You make this shit sound easy.
the lady says it's a go.
mom, it's the door.
put your videogame down and answer it for me.
do I have to?
Hey, Eddie. I don't know if you remember me.
used to live on the Army base with me and your daddy?
but Mom said he's not coming home.
there's nothing he wanted more than be with you.
Eddie.
go to your room, honey.
why are you here, John?
state Department already notified us.
why him?
why my baby?
it was that coup in Africa, wasn't it?
the one on the news?
I always believed he could make a difference.
casualties of war.
you went along because of him, John.
so tell me what I lost him to.
some stupid cause?
and now they're gonna fly him back...
and leave me with a folded flag and a bunch of medals.
it's not that simple. It was a covert op.
they're not bringing him back? - Well, I'm bringing him back.
and I'm telling you, he's gonna get full military honors and a proper burial.
listen...
what is this?
I'm gonna look after you and the baby now.
why is he taking so long?
don't worry. He's gotta come out eventually.
tell me you've got him.
unfortunately. I'm alive and they're dead.
John. John, it's good to hear from you.
look, I'm sorry about Jones, huh?
you know we had to maintain plausibility deniability.
you know what? You fucked us, and I'm not getting over that.
well, we can talk about that, John.
why don't you just come back in?
I'm coming in. Believe me, I'm coming in.
I'm coming in to get you. You wanted a one on one.
John, listen.
surveillance at the United Nations in New York...
turned up one of the people you red-flagged.
he had a suitcase filled with money. - Thank you, Kelly.
so you're back in business, Chapel.
now, there's two ways we can do this, John.
we can end up looking like Swiss cheese...
or we can go have a nice cup of coffee. What's it gonna be?
let's go have a cup of coffee.
get this truck outta here.
thank you.
Kelly?
just in from the FBI, sir. There's been a shootout in Miami.
one of the dead has been identified as a South African national.
he's a mercenary. We used him in Galmoral with Seeger.
great.
goddamn this.
where is Seeger?
a witness said someone matching his description was taken away at the scene.
maybe his friends? - Seeger doesn't have friends.
besides, a commando-style rescue mission in Miami...
is gonna cost somebody a great deal of money to organize.
get the jet ready.
we're going to Miami.
Dresham here. I need authorization.
well, here's to you. Cheers. - Yes. Thank you.
I heard the French had you.
like the CIA had you?
I didn't know I was gonna be twisting in the wind like this.
I'd have never let them do that to me...
and I'd have never let them do that to us.
the only reason I took this job was so...
but my heart never got sold out with the contract.
until now.
he's waiting for you.
you deserve each other.
and I thought ladies liked the bad boys.
I think she's mad at me.
how are you, John? I understand your anger.
I don't think that anyone really appreciates all that you do for them...
especially your country.
Yeah, three people died today. I was kinda wondering why?
it's either for nothing or for something.
you make the decision.
this is our assignment for Mr. Ahmet Dasan...
a millionaire extraordinaire.
Mr. Chapel has arrived, sir.
ahmet Dasan. - Pleasure.
please. Walk with me.
you are aware of my problem? - Yes, sir I've looked into your request.
but I must say, it's beyond my capabilities.
quite simply put, it cannot be done. I am sorry.
in four days from now, the United States Justice Department...
will be transferring my son from South Africa...
to a lockdown facility in Leavenworth, Kansas.
a lovely facility, I'm told.
guarded by the largest infantry division of the U. S. Army.
a well-known fact.
but, until then, the South Africans...
are detaining Kamal at the Randveld Prison outside of Cape Town.
I'm told it's a lovely facility, too.
to snatch your son from Randveld...
the most heavily fortified prison in the Southern hemisphere.
yet, it is not quite Leavenworth.
almost. Trust me. It can't be done.
I have controlled the arms pipeline through the Middle East for twenty years.
money? I am a billionaire many times over.
and I would spend every bit of it to free my first-born child.
but in order for an operation of this type to be completely successful...
I should anticipate a certain risk and certain...
expense.
that is just your payment, Mr. Chapel.
a quarter down, the rest when my son is standing before me.
now, tell me again how some things just can't be done?
I do stand corrected, sir.
you'll find twenty million dollars in an account in the Cayman Islands.
when that amount has been depleted it will be automatically refilled.
and how many times may I deplete it, sir?
you will know when you've reached the limits of my indulgence.
how?
there will be a bullet in your head, Mr. Chapel.
everything you need to know about Randveld is in these files.
you decide.
okay, here you go.
I'm not interested.
my employer's money has no idea what that concept means, John.
John...
they said they'd kill us if you didn't help them.
please, John, don't let them hurt my baby. We need your help.
they say they're going to take us to Africa.
John, I am going to need your help.
you know what?
I'm kind of fascinated that you just don't have any means of persuasion.
are you referring to a gun?
I don't touch a gun.
and guns don't touch me. That's why I'm still alive.
I think it'd be good if you let them go.
I think it would be nice if you understood that I'm a pushover...
but I am not an idiot.
and you promised Radio Jones that you would take care of little Eddie.
and little Eddie is being take care of, as you can see, quite well.
you kinda got me over a barrel. How much time do I have?
you have all the time in the world, as long as you do it within four days.
four days is just not enough time.
but we have money.
and money has a way of making time irrelevant.
there might even be something in it for you, John.
what do you say we get this show on the road?
tell the pilot we're ready to go.
okay, great.
I want a search of all the high end hotels in Miami.
the penthouses. Chapel's gonna be in one of them.
never mind.
what a pleasant surprise.
thank you.
someone's got some explaining to do.
computer support...
I'm gonna need somebody who can get a hands up on that right away.
do we have any word on Samuel? - Loyalty in a mercenary.
John.
that's a character flaw. - It is, isn't it?
actually, he's onboard. Couldn't resist being here...
after that disaster in Africa.
excellent. I suppose I'll get to see him soon.
Samuel?
would you like to inform John as to why you came so willingly?
I'm here for you, John.
fellow mercs reunited.
all the hate and mistrust. Warms my heart.
John, you never asked about Maxine.
I thought you and she were...
chapel must have deep pockets if he's able to buy you.
I suppose so.
sorry. Have we met before?
we partied on the same island once.
now, tell me about Chapel and your boyfriend.
as far as I know they've already taken off.
Kelly?
get on it. - Yes, sir.
you can keep the money. - Honey?
you work for me now.
what do you have?
private jet manifest shows fifteen unidentified passengers.
going where? - Flight plan says South Africa...
but it could be anywhere south of the pyramids.
Maxine? - Chapel has plenty of muscle and money.
where he chooses to flex them is none of my business.
Really? Oh, seeing Seeger one last time was, right?
you're really afraid of him.
Why? Does he have something on you?
so John does have a weakness. - Meaning what?
so we're going to Africa, huh? How about a safari?
look, I don't like the way shit went down. You know that.
and those men you led in?
one thing for sure, when you're a mercenary...
you're always gonna have casualties.
Cheers!
guaranteed?
guaranteed.
Where's the goddamned car, Kelly? - Over there, sir.
and what the fuck happened? Where are they?
they passed through the VIP line, sir.
how did they do that? - They had diplomatic passports.
great. Of course they did.
this is Kamal Dasan, son of Ahmet Dasan...
greek billionaire arms dealer.
our job is to break him out of prison.
our intel says that Dasan Junior's being kept...
at the most secure facility in Randveld.
there's guard stations at every point and marshals backing them up.
I don't think we'll have a problem with that.
how the fuck do you figure that?
at ten o'clock there's gonna be a shift change.
because of the large number of guards that are entering and exiting...
they're disabling their alarm systems for about six minutes.
that's when we make our move.
this is what's going to happen. The perimeter sensors are still left on.
samuel's going to disable the system in the north east sector...
which is gonna indicate a break-in in that area.
obviously, when that happens all exits will be automatically locked...
except for the guard entrances, for obvious reasons.
from this entrance they're gonna have direct access to the core...
which is where our boy is.
we may have to take a couple of guards out...
and then we may have to deal with the marshals with CXL.
what do you think? You think you can handle that?
fuck, yeah. Why don't we use nerve gas on these pussies?
with nerve gas, we're quite afraid that we may kill everybody, especially our boy...
similar to the girls that you are used to killing.
you wanna dance, motherfucker?
get up. Get up.
I think it's much better...
if we act like professional soldiers, don't you?
that's not in your job description.
let's get back to work. - Yes, sir. That would be nice.
we have a hole for you in Angola...
with your name on it, Kruger.
everybody feeling up for this?
all right.
John asked me to give you this.
Mr. Dresham would like to speak to you.
what did he want?
he wants me to gather intelligence for an operation he's running in Cape Town.
did he tell you what the target was?
is it the agency that wants John so badly or is it just you?
does it matter?
have the Americans arrived yet? - They're right behind you.
Mr. Dresham.
spano Malik, Chief of Police, Cape Town.
Mr. Malik, we have reason to believe...
there's going to be an attempt to break into the black vault.
this is an official request from the CIA.
your Foreign Affairs Division has asked you to help us on this one.
this is absurd. Totally absurd.
humor me. - It is not possible.
it can't be done.
the security systems were designed by Cape Town's top security specialists.
what are we talking about here, some sort of private army or something?
you should assume these men are as well trained as they are financed.
they've overthrown the governments of some of your largest depositors.
maybe you should pay attention.
so what's the CIA's interest?
there's an American national involved. We'll take care of him.
even if your information is correct, it's still impossible.
impossible?
maybe.
well, let's sign you in.
let's.
all control points are guarded.
blast doors that seal on the first alarm.
video surveillance, actually.
the doors are titanium vanadium alloy...
with six different blast buffers.
you could blow them in, but with the amount of explosives you'd need...
you'd probably bring the whole building down on top of you.
this is the storage database for the twelve largest banks in Southern Africa.
you see, Mr. Dresham, money is no longer a dollar bill.
it's a string of computer numbers with a name attached...
and our many depositors from all over the world require three things of us.
safety, security and anonymity.
well, of course they do.
there are no hard copies to these blueprints.
absolutely no one has access. - Good.
the software is all hardwired so they come up only on this unit.
try to copy, delete, print or transfer any of them...
they auto encrypt hundred two-fifty six-bit key.
the vault itself is opened only with...
two magnetic strip keys...
and a corresponding off site security code...
which changes every six minutes.
impressive.
clearly, your client's money is in very, very good hands, Mr. Malik.
indeed. I mean, these guys would be crazy to even try.
they won't. They don't have a chance.
we intend to put a stop to this party long before it gets that far.
good.
well, our department expects to be kept fully informed. Understood?
well, actually I don't even do that for my own government but...
I'm here for you.
Mr. Malik.
shall we?
seeger's gotta be crazy to try and break into that place.
Why?
you heard the man. Nobody has access to those files.
I want you to find out where Seeger and Chapel are operating from.
I don't think he trusts me that much. - Really?
well, you don't get paid to think, Maxine.
so fuck him and find out.
pimp.
can anyone tell me why we've put the control stations so far from the prison?
because they invented wireless transmission.
you did buy us that cellular relay tower in the mountain.
indeed.
so we control half the cellular phone transmission in the city. Why?
because when the prison goes down...
the locals might triangulate our communication traffic.
now, where would that leave them? - Hello, old boy.
I understand that you want to use Maxine as a distraction?
in a land of myth and time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests of shoulders on a young boy.
his name...Merlin.
look what's just arrived for you.
who are them from?
I don't know.
maybe Arthur.
how disappointing.
Why? Who would you like them to be from?
I don't know.
tall dark stranger.
see you in the morning.
a remedy to kill all ills
the body seems to have closed down.
Why?
you don't have an answer, do you?
nothing you've tried so far has worked.
it's been nearly two days.
what do you know?
I fear she may have some form of inflammation of the brain.
what could cause such a thing?
infection, possibly.
rest assured, I will do everything in my power to cure her, sire.
is she any better?
she's all but dead, Merlin.
no, you're going to cure her, you have to.
don't you start? I've tried everything.
I was wondering...
what?
maybe I could help
if you're suggesting magic,
have you forgotten what happened with Gwen's father?
this is not a magical illness.
it must be cured in conventional means.
we keep trying.
see if you can find me some fresh rosemary?
there must be something more I can do.
and yarrow.
what's your business here?
my name is Edwin Muirden, and I have a remedy to cure all ills.
is that so?
I beg an audience with the king.
the Court has a physician.
I hear the Lady Morgana was gravely ill.
that is no concern of yours.
I might be able to help her.
our physician has the matter in hand.
I will be at the inn in case you change your mind.
it's going to be all right.
it is, I know it is.
she's going to be absolutely...
Merlin!
what?
you're making me anxious.
but I'm not worried.
then stop pacing.
I can't preserve her life for much longer.
she has hours, maybe less.
we can not let her die.
Arthur...please.
there's a man. He came to the castle yesterday.
he claims he can cure her.
he says he has a remedy to cure all ills.
impossible.
for Morganna's sake, we should at least hear him out. I mean...
what have we got to lose?
please, Father.
probably some charlatan hoping for a quick shilling.
I don't care.
if she's about to die, what harm can it do? Give him his shilling.
if there's one chance in a million he can save her, then why not?
sent for him.
edwin Muirden, Sire. Physician and loyal servant.
welcome to Camelot.
have we met before?
I doubt you would forget a face like mine, sir.
do you really believe you have a remedy?
there are not many ills that I have not seen and successfully treated, Sire.
so when I heard of the Lady Morgana's sickness,
I felt honour bound to offer my services.
you say you have a cure for all? An antidote for everything?
Yes.
although it is not quite as simple as that.
Gaius is the court physician.
you are indeed a legend, sir. I am delighted to meet you.
I am curious to know what it is that has affected her.
an infection of the brain.
and your treatment?
yarrow.
Yes, yes.
rosemary to stimulate cerebral circulation.
interesting.
Why? What would you suggest?
no, no, no, that is all fine.
all good.
if that is... the right diagnosis.
what would your diagnosis be?
without examining the patient...
he should examine her.
I would need my equipment.
of course.
you'll have use of one of the guest chambers.
consider my manservant at your disposal.
I will start work immediately.
yes...it was all originally designed for alchemy.
making gold?
you have an interest in science?
well, science is knowledge.
it has the answers to everything.
maybe.
it can't explain love.
so you are in love?
no.
I mean... feelings, emotions.
you seem too bright to be just a servant.
Oh, don't be fooled, I'm not that bright.
Yes, we will need that.
now, we must hurry to the Lady Morgana. before it is too late.
put my equipment over there.
sire, I would be grateful if you could have everyone leave the room.
I require peace and privacy.
certainly.
that includes you, Gaius.
but I am eager to learn form your methods.
now is not the time for giving instruction.
I will need all my concentration.
Gaius...
why are you spying on me?
I wasnt. Im her maidservant.
then bring me some water.
someone should be with her.
do you want to be responsible for her death?
no.
then you will bring me some water.
now.
or she may die.
great news, Your Majesty.
you will be glad to hear it is not an inflammation of the brain.
what is it then?
it is cerebral haemorrhage.
Haemorrhage? I don't think so.
I found this trace of blood in her ear.
God in heaven.
the severity depends upon the site and volume of the bleed.
if not treated, it can lead to coma...and eventually death.
how could you have missed this?
I didn't see any blood.
please.
can you imagine what that might have done?
it may have increased the bleed.
is there a cure?
see for yourself.
Morgana, this is truly a miracle.
I thought... I really thought...
Oh, you won't get rid of me that easily.
what exactly did he give you?
I've no idea.
but thank heaven he did.
I want to offer you my congratulations.
thank you. She was all but dead and you brought her back to life.
how exactly did you do that?
I have developed an elixir for the treatment of just such an ailment.
I'd love to know the ingredients.
it is not yet perfected.
you must give me more time before I make it public.
the injury to your face?
it happened when I was very young.
perhaps it was I that treated you for it.
I told you before, we've never met.
Yes, of course.
well, I'll leave you to your work.
name your reward.
I desire nothing more than the good health of my patient, Sire.
there must be something I can do for you.
no.
I will wait until the Lady Morgana is fully recovered, and then I will be on my way.
why don't you stay a while?
you could live here at the palace.
no. I - I feel I would be trespassing.
and you already have a court physician.
I'm sure Gaius would be glad of your help.
it is a kind offer, but...
think about it.
dine with me later. Give me your decision.
to dine with Your Majesty would be reward in itself.
Gaius!
Geoffrey. I'm here to ask a favour of you.
anything for an old friend.
I wish to see the court records from the time of the great purge.
what possible need can you have for those?
I fear that the past may have come back to haunt us.
all the more reason to keep the records hidden.
I know that neither of us want to remember that time, but this is a matter of great urgency.
the records are sealed, they cannot be opened.
Uther has forbidden.
Geoffrey, I beg of you.
I'm sorry, Gaius.
this time you ask too much.
even for me.
Berbay odothay arisan yeldo
very good.
Unsfeffin.
you have magic.
it wasn't me, I didnt do anything.
then how else did you bring them to life?
only magic can do such a thing.
these little angels are how I cured Lady Morgana.
they repaired the damage to her brain.
they saved her life.
magic can be a force for good.
I know.
then why do you fear it?
Uther has banned it, it's not permitted.
should I have let Morgana die?
no.
people like us, we have a gift.
do you not think it should be used to make this a better world?
perhaps.
dont waste your time picking that up.
Formien doost ronane.
why waste a talent like that?
and I can teach you.
Readan ax giotan.
what do you use this for?
Gaius doesn't like me to.
a gift like yours should be nurtured, practised, enjoyed.
you need someone to help you, to encourage you.
perhaps.
imagine what we could achieve, if we shared our knowledge.
I should be getting back.
of course.
you must promise to keep our secret safe.
of course.
people like you and I, we must look after each other.
come in.
Gaius, you've been a good friend to me over the years, you've done me many kindnesses.
I cant deny you this one request.
the records?
I know you wouldnt ask unless it was important.
you must believe me, there's a great deal at stake.
if Uther were to discover this, he would kill us both.
it is for Uther's sake that I make the request.
trust me, please.
thank you, old friend.
it's unlike Gaius to miss something like this.
we all make mistakes.
Gaius is a great physician.
the very best.
which is what I dont understand.
what?
it's not for me to speak out of turn.
you saved the life of my ward, you may speak as you wish.
he has been prescribing sleeping drafts for Morgana.
she suffers from bad dreams.
Yes.
but the dreams should have been a warning.
you think the two may be connected?
Oh, yes.
a symptom of the illness?
I'm certain of it, yes.
and those potions, they masked the problem
and allowed it to develop to the point where...
...she nearly died.
if you hadn't come along when you did...
but I did and that is all that matters.
her life was saved... in the nick of time.
will you undertake a review of his work?
just to be on the safe side.
if it would put your mind at rest, Sire.
have you been up all night?
Yes, but it was worth it.
where are you going?
er, I told Edwin I'd be up at dawn to collect some supplies.
well, you'd better get a move on then.
your scar has healed well.
I often wondered what happened to that poor young boy.
I told you we've never met before.
you used your mother's maiden name.
you are Gregor and Jaden's son.
they were friends of yours.
they were sorcerers.
they practised magic.
and so did a lot of people back then, Gaius.
Uther will be furious when he finds out who you are.
fine.
fine. Shall we tell him? Let's go and tell him.
let's tell him everything.
Ooh, I know...
we could also tell him about Merlin.
Merlin?
you didn't know he was a sorcerer?
I wonder what Uther will do.
probably have him burnt.
you would betray another sorcerer?
you did.
when you turned a blind eye and let my parents die at the hands of Uther.
at least Merlin doesn't have a son who will try to rescue him from the flames.
you're here to take revenge.
and I have waited a long time.
you think I will sacrifice the King to save Merlin?
think about it, Gaius.
but if I find out that you told one other person, including the boy.
I will go straight to Uther.
I got your provisions.
Oh, thank you. Merlin.
Gaius was just reminiscing about old times, weren't you, Gaius?
Yes.
now, I must get back to work.
I'd better get on with my errands.
Yes, of course, you must.
do you want me to get you anything?
no, I'm fine.
just do what Edwin asks.
I have been through the court medical records with a fine-tooth comb, sir.
and were your findings satisfactory?
with regret, I would have to say they were not.
how so?
Gaius is a great man, thorough and dedicated.
But?
his methods are outdated.
he has failed to keep up with the latest developments.
this has led to a number of errors.
Gaius has served me well for 25 years.
and one cannot blame him for the infirmity those years have brought.
age can be a terrible curse.
perhaps it is time to lighten his burdens.
have you given any more thought to my offer?
Yes.
I have considered it very carefully.
allow me some time to do the same.
Uther, you can't do this.
you heard what he said. Gaius is old, he makes mistakes.
Gaius has treated me since before I can remember.
you cant cast him out.
you would have died if you care had been left to him.
that's something I could not bear.
I know, but...
I cannot risk something like this happening again.
Hello?
it is me, Gaius.
how old a man can become and yet change so little.
you have not changed either.
20 years, almost a lifetime to make the short journey back to where you began.
I'm not here for myself.
the boy?
you know about Merlin?
you have struggled against his destiny, but you can no more prevent it than he can.
so, it is true then?
Oh yes.
he and the young Pendragon one day will unite the land of Albion.
but he is in danger.
no. It is my gaoler who stands in peril.
must Uther be sacrificed for the boy?
their time cannot come until his is past.
but is that time now?
that is of your choosing.
I will not choose between them.
then turn a blind eye.
that is, after all, your talent.
Gaius.
my father need to speak to you.
when?
immediately.
sire. Is there a problem? Are you unwell?
this is not an ailment you can treat me for.
you've been a loyal servant for many years.
I look on you as a friend.
I regard you in the same way, Sire.
you've been here since Arthur's birth.
and all that entailed.
what I'm trying to do, I think is best for you.
I'm confused, Sire.
I'll give you a generous allowance to make sure you're looked after.
you're retiring me?
I dont want you to worry.
I'll allow you to continue living in your chambers, until more suitable accommodation can be found.
because I made one mistake.
although in truth, Sire, it was not a mistake.
it was...
yes Gaius?
it was unfortunate, I accept that.
may I ask who is to be the next court physician?
none of this was Edwin's idea.
initially, he turned down the offer.
I'm sure.
it's not been an easy decision, but...
the younger man, new ideas.
Yes.
you're hesitant.
is there a reason you oppose his appointment?
sire...
if you have anything to say, then say it now, Gaius.
this is difficult for both of us.
I thank you for your patronage.
it has been an honour and a pleasure to serve your family, for all these years.
Gaius! Uther cannot do this to you.
you tried to save Morgana.
Uther's not to blame.
I'll speak to Edwin, you can work together.
no, you mustn't do anything.
I cant stand by and do nothing.
Uther's right. It's time I stepped down.
what are you doing?
I cannot stay when there's no longer a use of me.
you're not leaving?
I believe it's for the best.
then I will come with you.
Merlin, you're like a son to me.
I never expected such a blessing so late in life.
and you are more than a father to me.
then, as a father, I must tell you, you must remain here.
Camelot is where you belong.
but you belong here, too.
not any more.
Merlin, you must promise me you will not waste your gifts.
my gifts mean nothing without you to guide me.
you have a great destiny.
if I have a smally part to play in that, then I am please.
there's so much I've yet to learn.
I need you to teach me.
I'm afraid I'm leaving here tonight, Merlin.
and there's nothing you can do or say that can persuade me otherwise.
I will not let this happen.
goodbye, Merlin.
I can't understand why Uther would sack him over one mistake.
a mistake that nearly killed Morgana.
besides, it wasn't the only one.
what do you mean?
edwin said his work was riddled with errors.
it's nonsense.
no-one wants Gaius to go, but my father's made his decision.
there's nothing anyone can do.
I think you'll be very happy here.
I'm sure I will.
when I reviewed Gaius's work,
I noticed he's been prescribing you arnica.
it's for my shoulder, it's an old battle wound.
it gives me a lot of pain.
may I take the liberty of providing a new prescription?
it should prove far more effective.
Really?
Oh, yes.
it is a remedy to cure all ills.
Gaius?
you're leaving?
Yes, I'm sorry I didn't come and say goodbye.
I dont want you to go.
I dont trust Edwin.
there was no blood in Morgana's ear.
he put it there.
he did something to her, I know he did.
you need to be careful who you say that to.
im saying it to you, because you can do something about it.
I cant.
but you think the same, dont you?
he's evil.
it's not that simple.
so you're going to turn your back on us.
I have no choice. I'm sorry, Gwen.
in life you always have a choice.
sometimes it's easier to think that you dont.
well then, my choice is to leave.
then I'll miss you.
goodbye, Gaius.
my lord!
my lord.
it seems the drugs I gave you have taken hold.
your body is now paralysed.
now, open your eyes, my Lord.
I want my face to be the last face you ever see.
you took my childhood from me.
and now finally, I take my parents' revenge.
within a few hours, the beetle will eat into your brain.
and you will suffer. as they suffered.
and I long to hear you scream, as they screamed.
the night you gave the order for the fires to be lit.
with your death, magic will return to Camelot.
goodbye, Uther Pendragon.
I will not allow you to kill Uther.
you've never had a problem letting people die before.
your parents were practising dark magic, just like you.
and how do you propose to stop me?
have you forgotten everything, Gaius?
you're getting too old.
I have a cure though.
Merlin! My father has Morgana's illness. We must find Edwin.
what are you doing?
he was trying to kill the King. I couldnt let him.
I can rule the kingdom now, with you at my side.
we can be all-powerful.
release him!
your loss, Merlin.
Svelt Merlin.
are you all right?
Yes.
thank you Merlin.
what are you doing?
Uther's ill. It's the same thing Morgana had.
edwin said he used these to cure Morgana. Maybe we can too.
Elanthia beetles.
are they magical?
Yes.
they can be enchanted to enter the brain, feed on it until the devour the person's very soul.
we must going to him.
how do we get the beetle out before it kills him?
it can only be magic.
you cant use magic on Uther. He'd kill us.
we dont have a choice.
Gaius!
there are times when it is necessary.
it is your right.
I dont know how.
if you dont, he's going to die.
what's happening?
has anyone ever told you, you're a genius.
you certainly haven't.
drink this. It'll help regain your strength.
there's nothing wrong with my strength.
do you remember them?
his parents?
I remember them all, Sire.
Gaius.
once again, you saved my life.
you've always served me well.
and I know there are things that I've asked you to do, which you found difficult.
you've always done what you believe to be right.
I was not right to betray you.
I'm sorry.
from now on, I will remember that in the fight against magic, you are the one person I can trust.
I, my family, and my kingdom are deeply indebted to you.
and in honour of this, I not only reinstate you as court physician, but henceforth, you are a free man of Camelot.
it's all ridiculous. I didn't save Uther, you did.
no, no. For once, I'm happy for someone else to take the credit.
you were prepared to sacrifice your life to save me.
where do you get that from?
I thought...
no.
I didn't do anything.
you saved me and you saved Uther.
maybe you are a genius.
you think so?
well, almost.
one day.
Arthur!
I saw Arthur lying underwater drowning, and there was a woman standing over him, watching him die.
we're dealing with she.
his name...Merlin.
Arthur... .
Arthur...
what is it?
you really are a total buffoon, aren't you, Merlin?
I was just asking... - Who? Me or the deer?!
we're supposed to be hunting. It requires speed, stealth and an agile mind.
so you get by on two out of three?
what was that? - Quiet!
help!
no, no, I beg you. Mercy.
help me!
stroke of luck.
and let that be a lesson to you!
what?
I was covering your back.
are you all right? They didn't hurt you?
no... Thanks to you.
I'm Sophia. This is my father.
Arthur Pendragon...
at your service.
my name is Aulfric, heir of Tirmawr, this is my daughter Sophia.
you're a long way from home. What brings you to Camelot?
our home was sacked by raiders, we barely escaped with what few possession we could carry.
these are dangerous times.
what will you do?
we travel west to Caerleon where we have family and, I hope, a new life.
you must stay here a while, break your journey.
a noble family like yours is always welcome at Camelot.
make sure you put her in a decent room.
the one next door is empty.
the one next door's fine.
excellent, in fact.
shut up, Merlin.
I didn't say anything! - You didn't have to.
I want to make it clear that my intentions towards Sophia are completely honourable.
put her in a room on the other side of the castle.
it's warmer, more comfortable.
of course.
she is, um, very beautiful.
Yes, she is.
and if your intentions are honourable...
Oh, they are. Most definitely.
then what's the problem with her staying next door?
there isn't one.
you've convinced me.
put her in the room next to mine.
who is that?
Sophia Tirmawr.
we rescued her in the woods. Well,
Arthur did most of the rescuing...
she can't stay here.
well, the King said that she and her father are welcome in Camelot.
is everything OK?
Yes. Thank you.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.
nonsense, my child.
my favourite patient is always welcome.
I'm sorry about the mess.
most of it's Merlin's. If I'd known you were coming, I'd have tidied up.
it's not that... Your bench is on fire.
my bench is on fire? What are you...
my bench is on fire!
here.
you're always getting me into trouble.
what brings you to this dark corner?
I had another dream.
I see.
I saw Arthur lying under water, drowning, and there was a woman standing over him, watching him die.
and she's here. In Camelot.
the mind plays tricks.
it borrows from everyday life and plays out its own fantasy.
I had this dream before she came to Camelot.
you must be mistaken.
I know what I saw.
it was so real...
so vivid.
I saw him die, Gaius.
she's going to kill him.
these are just dreams, Morgana, nothing more.
are you taking the sleeping draught I made up for you?
it doesn't help.
here.
try this.
it will induce a deeper sleep.
you've nothing to fear.
thank you, Gaius.
Morgana...
don't bother Uther about this
no need to worry him.
you can dispense with the unpleasantries - your payment.
I want more.
my friends are dead because of you.
Yes. I'm sorry. Such a dreadful waste of a life.
if it's any consolation, you'll see them again soon.
I'm taking Sophia out for a ride today.
you know, show her around.
where do I come in to this?
I'm supposed to be on patrol with the guard and my father this morning, so I need you to cover for me.
what, and lie to the King?
no way. No, he'll see right through me.
he'll have me in the stocks quicker than you can say "rotten tomatoes."
Merlin...
I start sweating, my vision blurs, my brain stops working.
well, no change there, then.
I promised Sophia I'd take her out.
if I don't turn up, it'll blow my chances.
you like her, then? - Yeah!
what's not to like?
I want to spend some time with her, but I need to get my father off my back.
I can't order you to lie to the King but you'll be a friend for life if you do.
go on, then. You don't want to keep her waiting.
Thanks, Merlin. I won't forget it.
you're sure it's her?
I could never forget that face.
you should speak to the King.
and tell him what? That I can see the future?
if you think Arthur's life is in danger...
you know how he'd react.
you're his ward. He wouldn't harm you.
he hates magic more than he cares for me.
that's not true.
would you care to put it to the test?
but what else can you do?
I'm going to have to try and stop her myself.
Where's my son?
I'm not sure where he is. I, um, I think there's been a mistake.
but it's not his fault. I mean...
stop gibbering and tell me where he is!
it's probably... No, it's definitely my fault.
where is Arthur!?
he's not here. - I can see that.
Arthur asked me to check to see if he was riding out this morning and...well...I may have forgotten.
you forgot? - I'm sorry, My Lord.
I'm sure he would have been here had I told him.
if this was a time of war, I would have you flogged.
and since it's not, we'll let it go just this once?
I forgot how much fun this was
the river's not far. It's just down here.
Arthur...wait.
what is it?
you there.
Halt!
sorry. - Sorry?!
you nearly shot a crossbow in my face.
are you OK?
Yes. Thanks to you.
they were searching for the bandits that attacked you yesterday.
here. - Don't touch that!
I'm sorry.
maybe we should go back? - It's fine. I...
I'm sorry, I was upset.
now, don't let this spoil our day together.
we were having such a nice time.
let's go down to the river. - I'm taking you back to Camelot.
your father would never forgive me if I let anything happen to you.
have you been playing with your food again?
the King put me in the stocks.
what did you do this time? - Nothing.
honestly, it wasn't my fault.
Arthur wanted to get out of going on a patrol with Uther and the guard, so I covered for him and took the blame.
and Arthur was prepared to let you do this?
it was his idea.
what made him neglect his duties? Must have been something important.
the girl from the forest?
he wanted to take her out for the day.
he is besotted.
but they've only just met.
I know.
I guess it must have been love at first sight.
yes...
I suppose it must be.
can I help?
forgive me!
the door was open. I thought someone may have broken in.
it looks like they have.
I apologise for imposing on you.
it won't happen again.
make sure it doesn't.
you're sure you'll be all right?
Yes.
thank you for today.
good night, Arthur.
sorry!
lady Morgana, isn't it? I'm Sophia.
what are you doing here? - My father and I are guests of the King.
you're lying.
I know what you're going to do to him, and I won't let it happen.
does Arthur know you feel this way about him?
of course he does.
I suspect he's already turned you down.
don't think you can make a fool out of me.
I won't have to.
you're managing to do that well enough already.
stay away from him! - Or what?
jealousy is such an unattractive trait in a women.
if anything happens to Arthur...
I'll find you.
however long it takes.
you've not been gone as long as I expected.
we were interrupted. - What happened?
I was nearly killed.
for a moment, I felt what it would be like to die a mortal death.
he saved me.
someone so weak, so feeble, saved me.
I can't bear to be like this a moment longer.
you won't have to.
once his heart is yours, the gates of Avalon will open once again for us and we can regain our true form.
I need a little more time.
you must hurry.
the physician can see us for what we truly are.
and he is not alone.
the Lady Morgana.
she fears her powers, but that will not keep her quiet for long.
tomorrow, you have to finish the enchantment, otherwise our chance to rid us of these mortal shells will be lost for ever.
you seem very fond of her.
you make that sound like a bad thing. - Not necessarily.
I've just never seen you fall under a woman's spell so quickly.
if you're jealous Morgana, it's OK to admit it.
don't flatter yourself!
come on. Wouldn't be the first time, now, would it?
Arthur, I'm trying to protect you.
she isn't what she seems.
Why? What makes you say that?
I just have a feeling.
it's difficult to describe.
I had a dream...
a nightmare.
you really are very sweet, Morgana.
why are you laughing?
you. Your feelings, bad dreams.
you can tell me the truth.
it's obvious you like me.
less and less by the second.
all right. Whatever you say.
you're intolerable.
I just hope I'm wrong about her.
you're dressed!
nothing gets past you, does it, Merlin.
you're supposed to be wearing these.
your father is bestowing a knighthood on one of your men this morning.
I'm giving it a miss.
won't the King mind?
not if you cover for me. By the way, thanks for yesterday, I heard you ended up in the stocks. Bad luck.
they were throwing potatoes. It's supposed to be rotten fruit.
I'm not sure there are hard-and-fast rules, but if it's any consolation, I think it was worth it.
it went well?
great. Fantastic...
she's incredible.
don't worry. I'll find a way to get you out of it.
just make sure you don't end up in the stocks this time.
I won't!
I think I'm starting to get the hang of this whole deception lark.
wait!
careful.
don't worry.
I will be.
what are you doing?
not again Merlin, surely?
you'd think the appeal of pelting the same person with fruit would wear off after a while, but, oh, no!
I heard that Arthur wasn't at the knighting ceremony.
Yeah, he wanted to make the most of his time left with Sophia.
so you helped him? I'm his servant. I had too.
you shouldn't done that Merlin.
I fear that Sophia may not be all that she seems.
Why?
what do you know about seers?
not much.
they're supposed to be able to see the future. Like prophets.
it's said to be an innate ability.
those who have it are born that way.
some aren't even aware that what they see is the future.
it comes in their dreams.
what's this got to do with Sophia?
the night before she and Aulfric came to Camelot, Morgana had a dream.
Sophia was in it.
before she arrived in Camelot?
I've been watching Morgana since she was very young.
though I've tried to persuade myself otherwise,
I realised that some of the things she said she'd dreamt came to pass.
I kept it secret from Uther, of course.
the gift of prophecy is too close to the work of magic.
you think Morgana is a seer?
no, I don't think it.
I fear it.
Morgana said she dreamt that Sophia killed Arthur.
couldn't that have just been a dream?
maybe the woman Morgana saw just looked like Sophia.
that's what I hoped.
but Aulfric caught me in Sophia's room and, in a flash of anger, his eyes changed colour.
who are they?
it's not who they are that worries me.
it's what they want with Arthur.
our love is strong. You feel the same way, too.
if we were ever to be parted...
I'd never let that happen.
you may not have the choice.
there are some here who don't want us to be together.
I'll never let them come between us.
because we are in love.
because we are in love.
you must seek permission for us to marry...
so that we can be together. - Till death do us part.
till death do us part.
he's ready. Tomorrow he'll do what we need him to.
good, you have done well.
I must go to the elders.
I seek an audience with the Sidhe elders!
I come before you to plead for the chance to win passage back to Avalon and a life of immortality!
your punishment for killing another sidhe is a mortal body and a mortal life.
you will never be able to return to Avalon.
the crime was mine, not my daughter's.
the gates of Avalon remain closed to your daughter.
unless the soul of a mortal prince be offered up to them.
an immortal life for my daughter is all that I desire, so I promise you the soul of the greatest prince of all.
Arthur Pendragon!
Avalon.
what you saw at the lake. It's Avalon. It must be.
what's... - The land of eternal youth.
mortals are only supposed to glimpse it the moment before death.
I've seen it and I'm still here.
extraordinary. What did it look like?
does it matter? They're going to sacrifice Arthur and we don't even know who "they" are.
we do now. I found writing like this on the top of Aulfric's staff.
it's Ogham, an ancient script.
to hold life and death in your hands.
from the writing on his staff and what you saw at the lake, I'm afraid now I'm certain.
we're dealing with the Sidhe.
that does not sound like a good thing.
they're masters of enchantment.
do you think Arthur's been enchanted?
almost certainly.
I'm afraid Morgana's dream is coming true.
father, to discuss a matter of great importance.
it cannot have escaped your attention that
I and Lady Sophia Tirmawr have grown very close.
not too close, I hope.
we're in love.
which is why I come before you today to ask your permission to marry.
I assume you're joking.
no.
I'm going to marry her. - But you only met two days ago.
we're in love.
in love?
we had no idea that you were such a romantic, had we, Morgana?
no, he's full of surprises.
I'm going to marry her.
I don't care what either of you think about it.
I thought you'd come to ask my permission.
out of courtesy, nothing more.
guards, door.
you've forgotten whose court you're standing in.
you won't stop me.
if I want to marry her, I will.
arrest Sophia and Aulfric Tirmawr.
what are you doing? - And inform the executioner his services will be required tomorrow morning.
you can't do this. - Yes, I can, and you show me some respect, I will!
release them.
you've got your whole life ahead of you.
Sophia is no doubt your first love but she certainly won't be the only one.
enjoy yourself while you can.
you're not planning on springing any surprises on me, are you?
you should be taking this more seriously.
he's young, foolish and in love.
give it a week and he'll be chasing after the next girl.
Sophia won't let that happen. - Do you bear a grudge against her?
there's something about her I don't trust.
you've seen the way Arthur's changed. - He's a fool in love.
she's dangerous. - Dangerous? To who?
Arthur.
why do you say that?
I just have a sense, a feeling.
and what has she done to make you have this feeling?
nothing, yet, it's what she's going to do.
I don't know how to tell you this.
try.
whatever it is, you can tell me.
I've just seen girls like this before.
they string men along and then drop them.
I don't want to see him get hurt.
I know you want to protect him but some lessons we have to learn for ourselves.
he'll hurt for a week and then Sophia will be forgotten.
I hope so.
are you sure there's nothing else behind this?
get out.
I thought the King was a bit harsh.
I don't need sympathy, Merlin, especially not from you.
but I did think he had a point.
I ordered you to get out. Now leave me!
I know you think you're in love with Sophia...
who are you to tell me what I'm thinking?
I'm your friend.
no, Merlin, you're my servant.
you don't know what you're doing.
she's cast a spell on you. You're enchanted.
I told you people would try to keep us apart.
I know. I won't let that happen.
don't listen to her, she's controlling you.
we can elope together.
get away from this place. These people.
I saw you.
I followed him.
they're planning to sacrifice you.
you let your servant talk to your guests this way.
I know what you're going to do. I followed you to the lake and heard everything.
you must believe me.
don't listen to him, Arthur.
let's go. Let's leave tonight.
she's going to kill you.
Sophia plans to sacrifice you to buy a life of immortality.
if you go with her, you'll die.
it doesn't make sense. We're in love.
they're magical beings.
look at the writing on the staff.
look at his eyes. Look at him.
do you believe me now?
Arthur, do you see?
I see everything.
he's gone, Arthur's gone with her. She's taken him.
slow down.
I know you don't believe me but I'm so sure it's going to happen.
my dream will come true. - I do believe you.
I've got to tell Uther. - You can't.
I've got to do something, if I don't then Arthur'll die.
you can't tell Uther about your dream.
if Uther thinks you've got the seers' power, he'll charge you with witchcraft.
I don't have a choice. I couldn't live with myself if I'd let him die.
wait.
we've known each other a long time, you trust me don't you?
Yes, you know I do.
then trust me now.
stay here and don't say a word to anyone about this.
but Arthur... - I'll take care of it.
where are you going?
to find someone who can help.
Merlin! What happened to you?
Aulfric. Where's Arthur?
I have got to go after him. What's that buzzing noise?
careful, Merlin, you can barely stand up.
I have to go. - You can't, not in this state.
you owe it to your powers that you survived this at all.
I'll be fine, he needs me.
has that buzzing stopped?
Yes. - Liar.
I have to go, Gaius. He'll die if I don't.
the Sidhe are a vicious people. You must be careful.
don't worry, I know what I'm doing.
Merlin?
this way. - Just testing.
go. They're waiting for you.
I don't understand. You're coming too.
only one of us can pass through. This was never meant for me.
but
I only wanted this so we could both return to Avalon.
your destiny is on a different path to mine.
it is my fate to live a mortal life.
I don't want to leave you. - You must.
once the ceremony begins you must go through with it.
the elders expect a soul. If they don't get his they will take yours.
goodbye.
I will never forget you.
father! No! No!
Arthur! Arthur!
Arthur
Arthur?
what happened?
where am I?
can you remember anything?
Oh, my head!
there was a girl.
Sophia, she...
I asked my father something about her, I asked him...
what was I thinking?
well, we did wonder.
especially when you eloped with her last night.
I did what?
Merlin had to bring you back to Camelot.
I don't recall any of this.
it must've been some blow.
what blow?
well, when I caught up with you I couldn't persuade you to return, you were beyond reason.
so I had to make you.
you managed to knock me out?
Yep. With a lump of wood.
he only did it to bring you back safely.
no-one can know about this.
any of it.
is that understood?
when you failed to show up for patrol this morning,
I feared you'd eloped with Sophia in a fit of passion.
I wish he had.
because then I wouldn't be standing in front of you feeling like an idiot...
again.
this is becoming a near daily occurrence for you.
there was a mistake. And I would not say it was anyone's fault.
not really.
you could say it was mine.
could somebody tell me what happened?
well... - Someone with a brain.
after Sophia left, I wanted to take my mind off her so I went for a hunt.
and killing things mends a broken heart?
no, but it's good fun.
Merlin was meant to inform you that I wouldn't be back until later today.
have you some kind of mental affliction?
probably. - I'm looking into it, sire.
well, I hope for our sake you find a cure.
or we'll find ourselves with a food shortage on our hands.
food shortage?
Morgana.
I've had some troubled nights.
I prepared another draught for you.
have the dreams stopped?
Arthur told me what actually happened.
you must have hit him round the head really hard.
Yeah. I feel really bad about that.
here you are.
remember, every night just before you go to sleep.
thank you, Gaius.
she must never find out the truth.
why not? She had a premonition that helped save Arthur's life.
it could've cost her her own.
if Uther ever found out, things would never be the same.
it must remain a secret.
is she like me?
can she use magic?
no-one's like you, Merlin.
but she has the gift?
for her sake, I hope not.
you should not protect this boy.
he's a druid. His kind would see me dead and you would help them.
if the boy lives you cannot fulfil your destiny.
enough!
we need your help. So now you want me to risk my neck too.
you're telling me that little boy is going to kill Arthur?
his name...Merlin.
Arthur... .
Arthur...
what is it?
you really are a total buffoon, aren't you, Merlin?
I was just asking... - Who? Me or the deer?!
we're supposed to be hunting. It requires speed, stealth and an agile mind.
so you get by on two out of three?
what was that? - Quiet!
help!
no, no, I beg you. Mercy.
help me!

Yes. I'm sorry. Such a dreadful waste of a life.
if it's any consolation, you'll see them again soon.
I'm taking Sophia out for a ride today.
you know, show her around.
where do I come in to this?
I'm supposed to be on patrol with the guard and my father this morning, so I need you to cover for me.
what, and lie to the King?

he'll have me in the stocks quicker than you can say "rotten tomatoes."

I promised Sophia I'd take her out.

I'm sorry.
maybe we should go back? - It's fine. I...
I'm sorry, I was upset.
now, don't let this spoil our day together.
we were having such a nice time.
let's go down to the river. - I'm taking you back to Camelot.
your father would never forgive me if I let anything happen to you.
have you been playing with your food again?
the King put me in the stocks.
what did you do this time? - Nothing.
honestly, it wasn't my fault.
Arthur wanted to get out of going on a patrol with Uther and the guard, so I covered for him and took the blame.
and Arthur was prepared to let you do this?
it was his idea.
what made him neglect his duties? Must have been something important.
the girl from the forest?
he wanted to take her out for the day.
he is besotted.
but they've only just met.
I know.
I guess it must have been love at first sight.
yes...
I suppose it must be.
can I help?
forgive me!
the door was open. I thought someone may have broken in.
it looks like they have.
I apologise for imposing on you.
it won't happen again.
make sure it doesn't.
you're sure you'll be all right?
Yes.
thank you for today.
good night, Arthur.
sorry!
lady Morgana, isn't it? I'm Sophia.
what are you doing here? - My father and I are guests of the King.
you're lying.
I know what you're going to do to him, and I won't let it happen.
does Arthur know you feel this way about him?
of course he does.
I suspect he's already turned you down.
don't think you can make a fool out of me.
I won't have to.
you're managing to do that well enough already.
stay away from him! - Or what?
jealousy is such an unattractive trait in a women.
if anything happens to Arthur...
I'll find you.
however long it takes.
you've not been gone as long as I expected.
we were interrupted. - What happened?
I was nearly killed.
for a moment, I felt what it would be like to die a mortal death.
he saved me.
someone so weak, so feeble, saved me.
I can't bear to be like this a moment longer.
you won't have to.
once his heart is yours, the gates of Avalon will open once again for us and we can regain our true form.
I need a little more time.
you must hurry.
the physician can see us for what we truly are.
and he is not alone.
the Lady Morgana.
she fears her powers, but that will not keep her quiet for long.
tomorrow, you have to finish the enchantment, otherwise our chance to rid us of these mortal shells will be lost for ever.
you seem very fond of her.
you make that sound like a bad thing. - Not necessarily.
I've just never seen you fall under a woman's spell so quickly.
if you're jealous Morgana, it's OK to admit it.
don't flatter yourself!
come on. Wouldn't be the first time, now, would it?
Arthur, I'm trying to protect you.
she isn't what she seems.
Why? What makes you say that?
I just have a feeling.
it's difficult to describe.
I had a dream...
a nightmare.
you really are very sweet, Morgana.
why are you laughing?
you. Your feelings, bad dreams.
you can tell me the truth.
it's obvious you like me.
less and less by the second.
all right. Whatever you say.
you're intolerable.
I just hope I'm wrong about her.
you're dressed!
nothing gets past you, does it, Merlin.
you're supposed to be wearing these.
your father is bestowing a knighthood on one of your men this morning.
I'm giving it a miss.
won't the King mind?
not if you cover for me. By the way, thanks for yesterday, I heard you ended up in the stocks. Bad luck.
they were throwing potatoes. It's supposed to be rotten fruit.
I'm not sure there are hard-and-fast rules, but if it's any consolation, I think it was worth it.
it went well?
great. Fantastic...
she's incredible.
don't worry. I'll find a way to get you out of it.
just make sure you don't end up in the stocks this time.
I won't!
I think I'm starting to get the hang of this whole deception lark.
wait!
careful.
don't worry.
I will be.
what are you doing?
not again Merlin, surely?
you'd think the appeal of pelting the same person with fruit would wear off after a while, but, oh, no!
I heard that Arthur wasn't at the knighting ceremony.
Yeah, he wanted to make the most of his time left with Sophia.
so you helped him? I'm his servant. I had too.
you shouldn't done that Merlin.
I fear that Sophia may not be all that she seems.
Why?
what do you know about seers?
not much.
they're supposed to be able to see the future. Like prophets.
it's said to be an innate ability.
those who have it are born that way.
some aren't even aware that what they see is the future.
it comes in their dreams.
what's this got to do with Sophia?
the night before she and Aulfric came to Camelot, Morgana had a dream.
Sophia was in it.
before she arrived in Camelot?
I've been watching Morgana since she was very young.
though I've tried to persuade myself otherwise,
I realised that some of the things she said she'd dreamt came to pass.
I kept it secret from Uther, of course.
the gift of prophecy is too close to the work of magic.
you think Morgana is a seer?
no, I don't think it.
I fear it.
Morgana said she dreamt that Sophia killed Arthur.
couldn't that have just been a dream?
maybe the woman Morgana saw just looked like Sophia.
that's what I hoped.
but Aulfric caught me in Sophia's room and, in a flash of anger, his eyes changed colour.
who are they?
it's not who they are that worries me.
it's what they want with Arthur.
our love is strong. You feel the same way, too.
if we were ever to be parted...
I'd never let that happen.
you may not have the choice.
there are some here who don't want us to be together.
I'll never let them come between us.
because we are in love.
because we are in love.
you must seek permission for us to marry...
so that we can be together. - Till death do us part.
till death do us part.
he's ready. Tomorrow he'll do what we need him to.
good, you have done well.
I must go to the elders.
I seek an audience with the Sidhe elders!
I come before you to plead for the chance to win passage back to Avalon and a life of immortality!
your punishment for killing another sidhe is a mortal body and a mortal life.
you will never be able to return to Avalon.
the crime was mine, not my daughter's.
the gates of Avalon remain closed to your daughter.
unless the soul of a mortal prince be offered up to them.
an immortal life for my daughter is all that I desire, so I promise you the soul of the greatest prince of all.
Arthur Pendragon!
Avalon.
what you saw at the lake. It's Avalon. It must be.
what's... - The land of eternal youth.
mortals are only supposed to glimpse it the moment before death.
I've seen it and I'm still here.
extraordinary. What did it look like?
does it matter? They're going to sacrifice Arthur and we don't even know who "they" are.
we do now. I found writing like this on the top of Aulfric's staff.
it's Ogham, an ancient script.
to hold life and death in your hands.
from the writing on his staff and what you saw at the lake, I'm afraid now I'm certain.
we're dealing with the Sidhe.
that does not sound like a good thing.
they're masters of enchantment.
do you think Arthur's been enchanted?
almost certainly.
I'm afraid Morgana's dream is coming true.
father, to discuss a matter of great importance.
it cannot have escaped your attention that
I and Lady Sophia Tirmawr have grown very close.
not too close, I hope.
we're in love.
which is why I come before you today to ask your permission to marry.
I assume you're joking.
no.
I'm going to marry her. - But you only met two days ago.
we're in love.
in love?
we had no idea that you were such a romantic, had we, Morgana?
no, he's full of surprises.
I'm going to marry her.
I don't care what either of you think about it.
I thought you'd come to ask my permission.
out of courtesy, nothing more.
guards, door.
you've forgotten whose court you're standing in.
you won't stop me.
if I want to marry her, I will.
arrest Sophia and Aulfric Tirmawr.
what are you doing? - And inform the executioner his services will be required tomorrow morning.
you can't do this. - Yes, I can, and you show me some respect, I will!
release them.
you've got your whole life ahead of you.
Sophia is no doubt your first love but she certainly won't be the only one.
enjoy yourself while you can.
you're not planning on springing any surprises on me, are you?
you should be taking this more seriously.
he's young, foolish and in love.
give it a week and he'll be chasing after the next girl.
Sophia won't let that happen. - Do you bear a grudge against her?
there's something about her I don't trust.
you've seen the way Arthur's changed. - He's a fool in love.
she's dangerous. - Dangerous? To who?
Arthur.
why do you say that?
I just have a sense, a feeling.
and what has she done to make you have this feeling?
nothing, yet, it's what she's going to do.
I don't know how to tell you this.
try.
whatever it is, you can tell me.
I've just seen girls like this before.
they string men along and then drop them.
I don't want to see him get hurt.
I know you want to protect him but some lessons we have to learn for ourselves.
he'll hurt for a week and then Sophia will be forgotten.
I hope so.
are you sure there's nothing else behind this?
get out.
I thought the King was a bit harsh.
I don't need sympathy, Merlin, especially not from you.
but I did think he had a point.
I ordered you to get out. Now leave me!
I know you think you're in love with Sophia...
who are you to tell me what I'm thinking?
I'm your friend.
no, Merlin, you're my servant.
you don't know what you're doing.
she's cast a spell on you. You're enchanted.
I told you people would try to keep us apart.
I know. I won't let that happen.
don't listen to her, she's controlling you.
we can elope together.
get away from this place. These people.
I saw you.
I followed him.
they're planning to sacrifice you.
you let your servant talk to your guests this way.
I know what you're going to do. I followed you to the lake and heard everything.
you must believe me.
don't listen to him, Arthur.
let's go. Let's leave tonight.
she's going to kill you.
Sophia plans to sacrifice you to buy a life of immortality.
if you go with her, you'll die.
it doesn't make sense. We're in love.
they're magical beings.
look at the writing on the staff.
look at his eyes. Look at him.
do you believe me now?
Arthur, do you see?
I see everything.
he's gone, Arthur's gone with her. She's taken him.
slow down.
I know you don't believe me but I'm so sure it's going to happen.
my dream will come true. - I do believe you.
I've got to tell Uther. - You can't.
I've got to do something, if I don't then Arthur'll die.
you can't tell Uther about your dream.
if Uther thinks you've got the seers' power, he'll charge you with witchcraft.
I don't have a choice. I couldn't live with myself if I'd let him die.
wait.
we've known each other a long time, you trust me don't you?
Yes, you know I do.
then trust me now.
stay here and don't say a word to anyone about this.
but Arthur... - I'll take care of it.
where are you going?
to find someone who can help.
Merlin! What happened to you?
Aulfric. Where's Arthur?
I have got to go after him. What's that buzzing noise?
careful, Merlin, you can barely stand up.
I have to go. - You can't, not in this state.
you owe it to your powers that you survived this at all.
I'll be fine, he needs me.
has that buzzing stopped?
Yes. - Liar.
I have to go, Gaius. He'll die if I don't.
the Sidhe are a vicious people. You must be careful.
don't worry, I know what I'm doing.
Merlin?
this way. - Just testing.
go. They're waiting for you.
I don't understand. You're coming too.
only one of us can pass through. This was never meant for me.
but
I only wanted this so we could both return to Avalon.
your destiny is on a different path to mine.
it is my fate to live a mortal life.
I don't want to leave you. - You must.
once the ceremony begins you must go through with it.
the elders expect a soul. If they don't get his they will take yours.
goodbye.
I will never forget you.
father! No! No!
Arthur! Arthur!
Arthur
Arthur?
what happened?
where am I?
can you remember anything?
Oh, my head!
there was a girl.
Sophia, she...
I asked my father something about her, I asked him...
what was I thinking?
well, we did wonder.
especially when you eloped with her last night.
I did what?
Merlin had to bring you back to Camelot.
I don't recall any of this.
it must've been some blow.
what blow?
well, when I caught up with you I couldn't persuade you to return, you were beyond reason.
so I had to make you.
you managed to knock me out?
Yep. With a lump of wood.
he only did it to bring you back safely.
no-one can know about this.
any of it.
is that understood?
when you failed to show up for patrol this morning,
I feared you'd eloped with Sophia in a fit of passion.
I wish he had.
because then I wouldn't be standing in front of you feeling like an idiot...
again.
this is becoming a near daily occurrence for you.
there was a mistake. And I would not say it was anyone's fault.
not really.
you could say it was mine.
could somebody tell me what happened?
well... - Someone with a brain.
after Sophia left, I wanted to take my mind off her so I went for a hunt.
and killing things mends a broken heart?
no, but it's good fun.
Merlin was meant to inform you that I wouldn't be back until later today.
have you some kind of mental affliction?
probably. - I'm looking into it, sire.
well, I hope for our sake you find a cure.
or we'll find ourselves with a food shortage on our hands.
food shortage?
Morgana.
I've had some troubled nights.
I prepared another draught for you.
have the dreams stopped?
Arthur told me what actually happened.
you must have hit him round the head really hard.
Yeah. I feel really bad about that.
here you are.
remember, every night just before you go to sleep.
thank you, Gaius.
she must never find out the truth.
why not? She had a premonition that helped save Arthur's life.
it could've cost her her own.
if Uther ever found out, things would never be the same.
it must remain a secret.
is she like me?
can she use magic?
no-one's like you, Merlin.
but she has the gift?
for her sake, I hope not.
you should not protect this boy.
he's a druid. His kind would see me dead and you would help them.
if the boy lives you cannot fulfil your destiny.
enough!
we need your help. So now you want me to risk my neck too.
you're telling me that little boy is going to kill Arthur?
in a land of myth and a time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young boy.
his name...Merlin.
did I surprise you?
you certainly did!
I've got another surprise for you, too.
It's...lovely.
well, in case you ever need a spare.
you know...for this...
it's beautiful!
you're a beautiful girl, Gwen. You deserve beautiful things.
but how...I mean...it must have been expensive?
Oh, very. But we're on the up now.
things are going to be different.
what's going on?
it'll be all right. Trust me.
I won't be back for supper.
Hello?
is it prepared?
Yes.
look.
very good.
what is that?
I'm not paying you to ask questions.
the lead, please.
you didn't say anything about magic. I don't want any trouble.
gold?
pure, priceless gold.
yours, blacksmith.
if you keep your mouth shut.
seize them! - Yes Sir
quickly, after him!
stop! He must be caught.
stop that man.
sire, please...
you're under arrest.
can't sleep?
something woke me.
what?
I don't know.
a feeling.
what kind of feeling?
powerful magic, here, in Camelot.
Gwen! What's wrong?
my father's been arrested.
arrested? What for?
they say he was making weapons for a sorcerer!
they're charging him with treason!
Treason!?
Yes, Morgana, treason.
the blacksmith was consorting with a known enemy.
enemy? What enemy?
Tauren.
the leader of a band of renegade sorcerers sworn to bring down the King.
and where is this Tauren now?
he escaped. - Well, then how can you be sure...
because Arthur saw him with his own eyes.
well, even if the man is who you say he is, you can't sentence Tom to death for just being seen with him!?
we have reason to believe he was forging weapons for Tauren.
rubbish! He would never do such a thing.
every man has a price.
found this on the blacksmith.
so he was paid!?
he's a blacksmith. He could've been paid for shoeing Tauren's horse!
in gold?
this is madness. You condemn a man with no proof!
I have enough proof.
Arthur! Have you nothing to say?
father, the blacksmith committed a crime, but we don't know for certain he meant treason?
no. You are right.
nothing's certain.
save one thing.
the law stands or this Kingdom falls.
but the law must give him a fair trial!
he'll get a fair trial, and he'll be found guilty, because that is what he is.
you execute Gwen's father, and I will never forgive you.
never.
maybe we should investigate further.
Tauren slept somewhere, he fed somewhere.
find anyone who helped him in any way.
they must be punished.
the people must see the laws of Camelot are not to be trifled with.
Yes, Father.
I didn't know Tauren was a sorcerer.
I meant no harm, I swear.
why didn't you tell me what was going on?
I knew you wouldn't like it, Gwen.
you're cautious.
I didn't want to let an opportunity pass.
opportunity?
you call this an opportunity?
I know.
I've been a fool.
I just wanted to make a better life for us.
for you.
I wanted to make you happy.
but I am happy!
I don't need anything else. I have everything I want.
and I've thrown it all away!
it's all right, I promise.
what did he say?
he said Tauren came to him at the forge, offered to pay him a fortune for his help, not to make weapons, for an experiment or something.
what kind of experiment? - Tauren didn't say.
but he used some kind of stone...
some kind of magic...
she's sleeping now.
I don't understand it.
what would a sorcerer want with Tom?
his forge, Merlin. It's the finest in the Kingdom.
you think Tom was lying? You think he really was making weapons?
no, I don't. - Then what?
when Tom was arrested, they found gold on him.
so?
from what Gwen was saying,
Tauren's experiment bears all the hallmarks of alchemy.
but alchemy's impossible, isn't it?
to change the very nature of one thing to another has defeated all who have tried.
but if you used magic...
do you think that's what woke me?
it is possible, I suppose.
Gwen?
Gwen?
Gwen?
Merlin.
Morgana?
how is she?
she's doing OK.
we should let her rest.
Yeah.
Morgana, have you spoken to Uther?
he must realise this is a mistake.
whatever Tom was doing, it wasn't plotting against the King.
I know that. Of course I do.
but Uther...
Uther only sees enemies.
but Tom is the most gentle soul I've ever met.
but he was seen with Tauren.
that makes him an enemy.
then...
there's little hope...?
there is no hope, Merlin.
none at all.
Arthur?
I'm sorry.
I came only to see you were comfortable.
how's Gwen? - She's a brave girl.
she wishes only to see you free.
I know what Uther thinks about sorcery.
I'm a dead man, aren't I?
I cannot see the future, only the present, and one must always seize the moment.
good luck.
they're to be executed? - Yes, Merlin.
by order of the King?
they committed a serious crime.
giving a man a bed for the night?!
not a man. A sorcerer.
maybe they didn't know that?
it is not for you to question my father's actions.
is that understood?
Yes, Sire.
now go get on with whatever you're meant to be doing!
sound the warning bell!
he's just proved his guilt.
you will kill him on sight.
but the trial, Father...
the trial is a formality. Now I want him dead.
and an end to it.
please...
kill him.
Nooooooo...
no, Father!!!
no, Father!!!
you have blood on your hands, Uther Pendragon.
blood that will never wash off!
may I remind you that you are speaking to your King!
may I remind you that a King is wise and just.
you are neither.
you rule only with the sword.
you know nothing of what it means to be King.
the fate of Camelot rests in my hands.
it is my responsibility to protect the people of this land from its enemies.
then the Kingdom is doomed.
for one by one you make enemies of us all.
you speak treason, Morgana.
only a mad man hears the truth as treason!
take care, child, or I'll have you restrained.
you just try.
and you will remain here until you learn your lesson!
then release me because I have learned it already.
that you care not for me, or anyone but yourself.
that you are driven mad with power.
that you are a tyrant!
all right?
I just don't understand. Why did he try to escape?
his trial was this morning.
sire...
Guinevere, I...
want you to know that your job is safe.
and that your home is yours for life.
I guarantee you that.
I know that under the circumstances it's not much but, erm, anything you want, anything you need, all you have to do is ask.
I'm sorry.
thank you, Sire.
I want the stone!
where is it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know anything about...
now you listen to me.
in two days' time, I'll be at the darkling woods at dawn.
you find the stone, you bring it to me, or you will die.
do I make myself clear?
Merlin, come and take a look.
I have been doing some research and found this.
the Mage Stone? - Wonder of the ancients.
lost for a thousand years or more.
what does it do? - Theoretically, it could give the bearer the power of transformation.
gold.
the power of alchemy.
exactly.
I believe it was the Mage Stone you sensed on the night of Tom's arrest.
of course!
Gwen said that Tauren had some kind of stone.
you.
how proud you must be.
son of the mighty Uther.
how you must look up to him.
does the King's little helper bring a message? Or have you just come to gloat?
guards!
get away from me, you cowards!
you're free to go.
Morgana.
yes?
I swore to him you'd never challenge his authority again.
I swore that you'd learned your lesson.
tread carefully.
next time, I may not be able to help you.
thank you.
you're a better man than your father.
always were.
my lady.
Gwen.
I didn't expect to see you here.
what happened to you?! - Nothing.
well, nothing a hot bath wouldn't fix.
I spent the night in the dungeon.
Uther.
he doesn't like to be challenged.
it wasn't about my father, was it?
you have enough to deal with without worrying about such things.
you shouldn't have done that!
not on my behalf.
if anything happened to you, I couldn't bear it.
you need to go home, Gwen.
get some rest. Please.
I'm fine, my lady.
I insist.
Gwen?
Gwen? - I can't go home.
it's understandable to feel so alone.
Tauren...
Tauren?!
he attacked me! He threatened me!
he was looking for some kind of stone.
stone?
he said if I didn't bring it to him, he'd kill me.
he's waiting for me in the darkling woods.
I have to do something.
if I don't get this stone to him by dawn tomorrow...
what are you going to do?
I'm going to send the guards, of course.
it won't be you that Tauren meets.
it'll be the Knights of Camelot.
Where's your maid?
I've come in her place.
kill her. - No! Wait! I brought the Stone!
what else have you brought, my lady?
the Knights of Camelot?
I came alone. I promise you.
give me the stone.
you were foolish to come here.
I had no quarrel with your maid.
but you, my Lady Morgana, you are Uther's ward.
if you kill me, you'll regret it.
Why's that?
because I want Uther dead, too.
you? An enemy of the King?
and I'm to believe that?
why else would I be here?
I can only guess at your motives, My Lady.
you could be a spy, for all I know.
and this...
is it usual for Uther to chain his friends to a dungeon wall?
the stone.
you took it to the forge. Why?
with it a man can alter the very essence of things.
he can turn a lump of lead into gold.
gold?
a good man died in your quest for riches, Tauren.
his daughter is now an orphan.
I am sorry for that.
truly.
but we did not want the gold to line our pockets.
the gold was but a means, a means to rid this Kingdom of Uther Pendragon once and for all.
what are you saying?
bribery is rife at Camelot.
I will use the corruption at the heart of his kingdom, and such an abundance of gold will buy me into the King's chambers, even to the King himself.
the guards may be fools, Tauren, but the King is not.
do you have a better plan?
to get to Uther, you need someone close to him.
and you know of such a person?
I do.
me.
pass the salt, please.
you all right?
what?
Yeah.
I've just got a few things on my mind, that's all.
anything you'd like to talk to me about?
I can't imagine you'd be interested.
so long as you're sure.
I should be getting to work.
er, Merlin?
that's a broom cupboard.
well, young warlock, what is it you come to ask of me?
I need your help.
of course you do, but this time, will you heed my words?
the sorcerer Tauren is plotting to kill the King.
he has made an ally of Morgana.
I don't know what to do!
do...
nothing.
what do you mean?
if I do nothing, Uther will die.
don't you want Uther dead?
it is Uther that persecutes you and your kind, Merlin.
it is Uther that murders the innocent...
but surely that doesn't make it right to kill him!
only if Uther dies can magic return to the land.
only if Uther dies will you be free, Merlin.
Uther's reign is at an end.
let Arthur's reign begin.
fulfil your destiny!
wait!
where does it say my destiny includes murder?
free this land from tyranny, Merlin.
free us all!
I didn't expect to see you.
you wish to say something?
I came to apologise, my Lord.
good.
I didn't mean to rile you.
I thought only of Gwen.
the poor girl is all alone in this world.
it was not my intention to hurt your maid.
I know.
but now she suffers.
and I know how she must suffer.
Morgana...
I only meant,
I know what it's like to lose a father.
that was a terrible day. Your father was a great friend.
I had no part in his death.
you sent him into battle.
you promised him reinforcements and then gave him none.
you sent him to his death.
that is not true.
it was never my intention. - But it happened!
and it keeps on happening.
Morgana!
I'm sorry, my lord.
do you think Uther's a good King?
sorry?
Uther. Do you think he's good for the Kingdom?
Yes. Yes, I do.
in the light of recent events, you may find that hard to believe.
hard? No. Impossible? Definitely.
Merlin... - Everyone hates him.
it is not Uther's job to be liked.
it is Uther's job to protect the Kingdom.
most of his methods are right.
sometimes he may go too far.
Really? You mean like executing anyone who even passes a sorcerer on the street?
Yes.
despite Uther's failings, he has brought peace and prosperity to this Kingdom.
but at what cost?
at the cost of women and children, fathers and sons!
when will it end?
it will end when Arthur is King.
then why not let that time be now?
why not let Arthur be King?
Arthur's not ready.
the responsibility would be too great.
brave though he may be, he lacks experience, he lacks judgment.
is there anything you want to tell me?
I can't... I just.
no, I can't.
you've just got to trust me.
Gaius, it's something I've got to work out for myself.
I do trust you, Merlin.
whatever it is,
I know you'll make the right decision.
Morgana!
I'm not disturbing you, I hope?
not at all.
these are difficult times.
they put a strain on us all.
Yes, my lord.
I cannot tell you how much it pains me to be at odds with you.
and I with you.
I've been thinking about what you said.
and
I realise I may have been insensitive.
I should have foreseen the distress that your maid's loss would cause you, that it would stir old memories.
I've opened an old wound.
for that, I'm sorry.
my Lord, it gladdens my heart to hear these words.
I too wish to heal these wounds.
let us visit my father's grave together and put the past behind us.
nothing would give me greater happiness.
shall we leave tomorrow at first light?
I will make arrangements.
so, My Lady, what news?
Uther has fallen for the bait.
we ride out in the morning for the Old Cairn on the hill.
are you sure you're committed to this?
more than ever - I want Uther dead as much as you.
as much as anyone in this rotten Kingdom of his.
then the deed is as good as done.
Merlin?
Gwen.
how are you doing?
I was about to ask you the same question.
I'm fine.
fine.
Morgana's been amazing these last few days.
I think you've been amazing.
after all that's happened, getting your life back together...
it's better than sitting in an empty house, waiting for my father to walk through the door.
the thing I find hardest to bear is that people will always think he was guilty because he tried to escape.
I know he was innocent.
I think he tried to escape because he knew that whatever he said or did he'd be killed.
Uther had already made up his mind.
that's the kind of man he is.
I wouldn't blame you if you wanted him dead.
if Uther died I'd feel nothing.
he means nothing to me.
but if you had, you know, the choice, what would you do?
if you had the power of life and death over Uther, would you kill him?
for what he did?
No!
no?
what would that solve?
that would make me a murderer.
that would make me as bad as him.
you're right.
of course you're right.
is anything wrong?! - No, no. See you later!
do you think that we could have some privacy?
fine. Wait here. We're in no danger.
sire
father...
your father was the greatest man I've ever known.
he stood for everything this kingdom represents.
truth, justice, valour.
a hundred times he saved my life on the battlefield.
his courage and his honour were without equal.
when Gorlois died, I lost the truest friend I ever had.
for he was as fearless in questioning my judgment as he was in defending my kingdom.
that's the mark of a true friend.
I know how he respected you, my lord.
but I don't share these memories.
how can I? I was ten years old.
I only know I loved him and he was taken from me.
when he died, and I took you into my care, you fought me from the beginning.
your will is as strong as my own.
you challenge me as a friend must.
as your father did in his time.
but when I do, you clap me in irons.
I know I'm not an easy man.
my temper blinds me sometimes. There are things that I regret.
Gwen's father?
Yes.
are you saying you were wrong to have Tom killed?
Yes.
I will strive to listen to you more and quarrel with you less.
a blessing to me, Morgana.
you are the daughter I never had.
your counsel is invaluable, as is your friendship and your love.
my Lord - Please forgive me, Morgana.
No!
die, Uther Pendragon!
busy day? - Had its moments.
I hear that Tauren tried to assassinate Uther.
that's what I hear. - And that Morgana saved him.
how many men were there? Three? Four?
Yeah, something like that.
Morgana must have shown extraordinary courage to have defended a king against such odds.
I suppose you had nothing to do with it?
Oh, you know. Just background stuff.
no need to be so modest, Merlin.
sorry. - It's not a criticism.
it's a compliment.
right.
Thanks, Gaius.
somebody help me!
please, Merlin???
you should not have killed my friend.
in a land of myth and a time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young boy.
his name...Merlin.
did I surprise you? You certainly did!
I've got another surprise for you, too.
It's...lovely. Well, in case you ever need a spare.
you know...for this...
it's beautiful!
you're a beautiful girl, Gwen. You deserve beautiful things.
but how...I mean...It must have been expensive?
Oh, very. But we're on the up now.
things are going to be different.
what's going on? It'll be all right. Trust me.
I won't be back for supper.
Hello?
is it prepared?
Yes. Look.
very good.
what is that?
I'm not paying you to ask questions.
the lead, please.
you didn't say anything about magic. I don't want any trouble.
gold?
pure, priceless gold.
yours, blacksmith. If you keep your mouth shut.
seize them!
quickly, after him!
stop! He must be caught.
stop that man.
sire, please... You're under arrest.
can't sleep?
something woke me.
what?
I don't know.
a feeling.
what kind of feeling?
powerful magic, here, in Camelot.
Gwen! What's wrong?
my father's been arrested. Arrested? What for?
they say he was making weapons for a sorcerer!
they're charging him with treason!
Treason!? Yes, Morgana, treason.
the blacksmith was consorting with a known enemy.
enemy? What enemy? Tauren.
the leader of a band of renegade sorcerers sworn to bring down the King.
and where is this Tauren now?
he escaped. Well, then how can you be sure...
because Arthur saw him with his own eyes.
well, even if the man is who you say he is, you can't sentence Tom to death for just being seen with him!?
we have reason to believe he was forging weapons for Tauren.
rubbish! He would never do such a thing.
every man has a price.
found this on the blacksmith.
so he was paid!? He's a blacksmith.
he could've been paid for shoeing Tauren's horse!
in gold?
this is madness. You condemn a man with no proof!
I have enough proof.
Arthur! Have you nothing to say?
father, the blacksmith committed a crime, but we don't know for certain he meant treason?
no. You are right.
nothing's certain. Save one thing.
the law stands or this Kingdom falls.
but the law must give him a fair trial!
he'll get a fair trial, and he'll be found guilty, because that is what he is.
you execute Gwen's father, and I will never forgive you.
never.
maybe we should investigate further.
Tauren slept somewhere, he fed somewhere.
find anyone who helped him in any way.
they must be punished.
the people must see the laws of Camelot are not to be trifled with.
Yes, Father.
I didn't know Tauren was a sorcerer.
I meant no harm, I swear.
why didn't you tell me what was going on?
I knew you wouldn't like it, Gwen. You're cautious.
I didn't want to let an opportunity pass. Opportunity?
you call this an opportunity?
I know.
I've been a fool.
I just wanted to make a better life for us.
for you.
I wanted to make you happy.
but I am happy!
I don't need anything else. I have everything I want.
and I've thrown it all away!
it's all right, we'll get you out of here.
I promise.
what did he say?
he said Tauren came to him at the forge, offered to pay him a fortune for his help, not to make weapons, for an experiment or something.
what kind of experiment? Tauren didn't say.
but he used some kind of stone...
some kind of magic...
she's sleeping now.
I don't understand it.
what would a sorcerer want with Tom?
his forge, Merlin. It's the finest in the Kingdom.
you think Tom was lying?
you think he really was making weapons?
no, I don't. Then what?
when Tom was arrested, they found gold on him.
so? From what Gwen was saying,
Tauren's experiment bears all the hallmarks of alchemy.
but alchemy's impossible, isn't it?
to change the very nature of one thing to another has defeated all who have tried.
but if you used magic...
do you think that's what woke me?
it is possible, I suppose.
Gwen?
Gwen?
Gwen?
Merlin. Morgana?
how is she?
she's doing OK.
we should let her rest.
Yeah.
Morgana, have you spoken to Uther?
he must realise this is a mistake.
whatever Tom was doing, it wasn't plotting against the King.
I know that. Of course I do.
but Uther...
Uther only sees enemies.
but Tom is the most gentle soul I've ever met.
but he was seen with Tauren.
that makes him an enemy.
Then...there's little hope...?
there is no hope, Merlin.
none at all.
Arthur?
I knew you would never done it. I'm sorry.
I came only to see you were comfortable.
how's Gwen? She's a brave girl.
she wishes only to see you free.
I know what Uther thinks about sorcery.
I'm a dead man, aren't I?
I cannot see the future, only the present, and one must always seize the moment.
good luck.
they're to be executed? Yes, Merlin.
by order of the King? They committed a serious crime.
giving a man a bed for the night?!
not a man. A sorcerer. Maybe they didn't know that?
it is not for you to question my father's actions.
is that understood?
Yes, Sire.
now go get on with whatever you're meant to be doing!
sound the warning bell!
he's just proved his guilt.
you will kill him on sight. But the trial, Father...
the trial is a formality.
now I want him dead. And an end to it.
please...
kill him. Nooooooo...
no, Father!!!
no, Father!!!
you have blood on your hands, Uther Pendragon.
blood that will never wash off!
may I remind you that you are speaking to your King!
may I remind you that a King is wise and just.
you are neither. You rule only with the sword.
you know nothing of what it means to be King.
the fate of Camelot rests in my hands.
it is my responsibility to protect the people of this land from its enemies.
then the Kingdom is doomed.
for one by one you make enemies of us all.
you speak treason, Morgana.
only a mad man hears the truth as treason!
take care, child, or I'll have you restrained.
you just try.
and you will remain here until you learn your lesson!
then release me because I have learned it already.
that you care not for me, or anyone but yourself.
that you are driven mad with power.
that you are a tyrant!
all right?
I just don't understand. Why did he try to escape?
his trial was this morning.
sire...
Guinevere, I...
want you to know that your job is safe.
and that your home is yours for life.
I guarantee you that.
I know that under the circumstances it's not much but, erm, anything you want, anything you need, all you have to do is ask.
I'm sorry.
thank you, Sire.
I want the stone!
where is it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know anything about... Now you listen to me.
in two days' time, I'll be at the darkling woods at dawn.
you find the stone, you bring it to me, or you will die.
do I make myself clear?
Merlin, come and take a look.
I have been doing some research and found this.
the Mage Stone? Wonder of the ancients.
lost for a thousand years or more.
what does it do?
theoretically, it could give the bearer the power of transformation.
gold.
the power of alchemy. Exactly.
I believe it was the Mage Stone you sensed on the night of Tom's arrest.
of course!
Gwen said that Tauren had some kind of stone.
you.
how proud you must be.
son of the mighty Uther.
how you must look up to him.
does the King's little helper bring a message?
or have you just come to gloat?
guards!
get away from me, you cowards!
you're free to go.
Morgana. Yes?
I swore to him you'd never challenge his authority again.
I swore that you'd learned your lesson.
tread carefully.
next time, I may not be able to help you.
thank you.
you're a better man than your father. Always were.
my lady.
Gwen.
I didn't expect to see you here.
what happened to you?!
nothing. Well, nothing a hot bath wouldn't fix.
I spent the night in the dungeon.
Uther.
he doesn't like to be challenged.
it wasn't about my father, was it?
you have enough to deal with without worrying about such things.
you shouldn't have done that!
not on my behalf.
if anything happened to you, I couldn't bear it.
you need to go home, Gwen.
get some rest. Please. I'm fine, my lady.
I insist.
Gwen?
Gwen? I can't go home.
it's understandable to feel so alone.
Tauren...
Tauren?!
he attacked me! He threatened me!
he was looking for some kind of stone.
stone?
he said if I didn't bring it to him, he'd kill me.
he's waiting for me in the darkling woods.
I have to do something.
if I don't get this stone to him by dawn tomorrow...
what are you going to do?
I'm going to send the guards, of course.
it won't be you that Tauren meets.
it'll be the Knights of Camelot.
Where's your maid? I've come in her place.
kill her. No! Wait!
I brought the Stone!
what else have you brought, my lady?
the Knights of Camelot?
I came alone. I promise you.
give me the stone.
you were foolish to come here.
I had no quarrel with your maid.
but you, my Lady Morgana, you are Uther's ward.
if you kill me, you'll regret it.
Why's that?
because I want Uther dead, too.
you? An enemy of the King?
and I'm to believe that?
why else would I be here?
I can only guess at your motives, My Lady.
you could be a spy, for all I know.
and this...
is it usual for Uther to chain his friends to a dungeon wall?
the stone. You took it to the forge. Why?
with it a man can alter the very essence of things.
he can turn a lump of lead into gold.
gold?
a good man died in your quest for riches, Tauren.
his daughter is now an orphan.
I am sorry for that.
truly.
but we did not want the gold to line our pockets.
the gold was but a means, a means to rid this Kingdom of Uther Pendragon once and for all.
what are you saying?
bribery is rife at Camelot.
I will use the corruption at the heart of his kingdom, and such an abundance of gold will buy me into the King's chambers, even to the King himself.
the guards may be fools, Tauren, but the King is not.
do you have a better plan?
to get to Uther, you need someone close to him.
and you know of such a person?
I do.
me.
pass the salt, please.
you all right? What?
Yeah.
I've just got a few things on my mind, that's all.
anything you'd like to talk to me about?
I can't imagine you'd be interested.
so long as you're sure.
I should be getting to work.
er, Merlin?
that's a broom cupboard.
well, young warlock, what is it you come to ask of me?
I need your help. Of course you do, but this time, will you heed my words?
the sorcerer Tauren is plotting to kill the King.
he has made an ally of Morgana.
I don't know what to do!
do...
nothing.
what do you mean?
if I do nothing, Uther will die.
don't you want Uther dead?
it is Uther that persecutes you and your kind, Merlin.
it is Uther that murders the innocent...
but surely that doesn't make it right to kill him!
only if Uther dies can magic return to the land.
only if Uther dies will you be free, Merlin.
Uther's reign is at an end.
let Arthur's reign begin.
fulfil your destiny!
wait! Where does it say my destiny includes murder?
free this land from tyranny, Merlin.
free us all!
I didn't expect to see you.
you wish to say something?
I came to apologise, my Lord.
good.
I didn't mean to rile you.
I thought only of Gwen.
the poor girl is all alone in this world.
it was not my intention to hurt your maid.
I know.
but now she suffers.
and I know how she must suffer.
Morgana... I only meant,
I know what it's like to lose a father.
that was a terrible day. Your father was a great friend.
I had no part in his death.
you sent him into battle.
you promised him reinforcements and then gave him none.
you sent him to his death. That is not true.
it was never my intention. But it happened!
and it keeps on happening.
Morgana! I'm sorry, my lord.
do you think Uther's a good King?
sorry?
Uther. Do you think he's good for the Kingdom?
Yes. Yes, I do.
in the light of recent events, you may find that hard to believe.
hard? No. Impossible? Definitely.
Merlin... Everyone hates him.
it is not Uther's job to be liked.
it is Uther's job to protect the Kingdom.

that makes him an enemy.
Then...there's little hope...?
there is no hope, Merlin.
none at all.
Arthur?
I knew you would never done it. I'm sorry.
I came only to see you were comfortable.
how's Gwen? She's a brave girl.
she wishes only to see you free.
I know what Uther thinks about sorcery.
I'm a dead man, aren't I?
I cannot see the future, only the present, and one must always seize the moment.
good luck.
they're to be executed? Yes, Merlin.
by order of the King? They committed a serious crime.
giving a man a bed for the night?!
not a man. A sorcerer. Maybe they didn't know that?
it is not for you to question my father's actions.
is that understood?
Yes, Sire.
now go get on with whatever you're meant to be doing!
sound the warning bell!
he's just proved his guilt.
you will kill him on sight. But the trial, Father...
the trial is a formality.
now I want him dead. And an end to it.
please...
kill him. Nooooooo...
no, Father!!!
no, Father!!!
you have blood on your hands, Uther Pendragon.
blood that will never wash off!
may I remind you that you are speaking to your King!
may I remind you that a King is wise and just.
you are neither. You rule only with the sword.
you know nothing of what it means to be King.
the fate of Camelot rests in my hands.
it is my responsibility to protect the people of this land from its enemies.
then the Kingdom is doomed.
for one by one you make enemies of us all.
you speak treason, Morgana.
only a mad man hears the truth as treason!
take care, child, or I'll have you restrained.
you just try.
and you will remain here until you learn your lesson!
then release me because I have learned it already.
that you care not for me, or anyone but yourself.
that you are driven mad with power.
that you are a tyrant!
all right?
I just don't understand. Why did he try to escape?
his trial was this morning.
sire...
Guinevere, I...
want you to know that your job is safe.
and that your home is yours for life.
I guarantee you that.
I know that under the circumstances it's not much but, erm, anything you want, anything you need, all you have to do is ask.
I'm sorry.
thank you, Sire.
I want the stone!
where is it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know anything about... Now you listen to me.
in two days' time, I'll be at the darkling woods at dawn.
you find the stone, you bring it to me, or you will die.
do I make myself clear?
Merlin, come and take a look.
I have been doing some research and found this.
the Mage Stone? Wonder of the ancients.
lost for a thousand years or more.
what does it do?
theoretically, it could give the bearer the power of transformation.
gold.
the power of alchemy. Exactly.
I believe it was the Mage Stone you sensed on the night of Tom's arrest.
of course!
Gwen said that Tauren had some kind of stone.
you.
how proud you must be.
son of the mighty Uther.
how you must look up to him.
does the King's little helper bring a message?
or have you just come to gloat?
guards!
get away from me, you cowards!
you're free to go.
Morgana. Yes?
I swore to him you'd never challenge his authority again.
I swore that you'd learned your lesson.
tread carefully.
next time, I may not be able to help you.
thank you.
you're a better man than your father. Always were.
my lady.
Gwen.
I didn't expect to see you here.
what happened to you?!
nothing. Well, nothing a hot bath wouldn't fix.
I spent the night in the dungeon.
Uther.
he doesn't like to be challenged.
it wasn't about my father, was it?
you have enough to deal with without worrying about such things.
you shouldn't have done that!
not on my behalf.
if anything happened to you, I couldn't bear it.
you need to go home, Gwen.
get some rest. Please. I'm fine, my lady.
I insist.
Gwen?
Gwen? I can't go home.
it's understandable to feel so alone.
Tauren...
Tauren?!
he attacked me! He threatened me!
he was looking for some kind of stone.
stone?
he said if I didn't bring it to him, he'd kill me.
he's waiting for me in the darkling woods.
I have to do something.
if I don't get this stone to him by dawn tomorrow...
what are you going to do?
I'm going to send the guards, of course.
it won't be you that Tauren meets.
it'll be the Knights of Camelot.
Where's your maid? I've come in her place.
kill her. No! Wait!
I brought the Stone!
what else have you brought, my lady?
the Knights of Camelot?
I came alone. I promise you.
give me the stone.
you were foolish to come here.
I had no quarrel with your maid.
but you, my Lady Morgana, you are Uther's ward.
if you kill me, you'll regret it.
Why's that?
because I want Uther dead, too.
you? An enemy of the King?
and I'm to believe that?
why else would I be here?
I can only guess at your motives, My Lady.
you could be a spy, for all I know.
and this...
is it usual for Uther to chain his friends to a dungeon wall?
the stone. You took it to the forge. Why?
with it a man can alter the very essence of things.
he can turn a lump of lead into gold.
gold?
a good man died in your quest for riches, Tauren.
his daughter is now an orphan.
I am sorry for that.
truly.
but we did not want the gold to line our pockets.
the gold was but a means, a means to rid this Kingdom of Uther Pendragon once and for all.
what are you saying?
bribery is rife at Camelot.
I will use the corruption at the heart of his kingdom, and such an abundance of gold will buy me into the King's chambers, even to the King himself.
the guards may be fools, Tauren, but the King is not.
do you have a better plan?
to get to Uther, you need someone close to him.
and you know of such a person?
I do.
me.
pass the salt, please.
you all right? What?
Yeah.
I've just got a few things on my mind, that's all.
anything you'd like to talk to me about?
I can't imagine you'd be interested.
so long as you're sure.
I should be getting to work.
er, Merlin?
that's a broom cupboard.
well, young warlock, what is it you come to ask of me?
I need your help. Of course you do, but this time, will you heed my words?
the sorcerer Tauren is plotting to kill the King.
he has made an ally of Morgana.
I don't know what to do!
do...
nothing.
what do you mean?
if I do nothing, Uther will die.
don't you want Uther dead?
it is Uther that persecutes you and your kind, Merlin.
it is Uther that murders the innocent...
but surely that doesn't make it right to kill him!
only if Uther dies can magic return to the land.
only if Uther dies will you be free, Merlin.
Uther's reign is at an end.
let Arthur's reign begin.
fulfil your destiny!
wait! Where does it say my destiny includes murder?
free this land from tyranny, Merlin.
free us all!
I didn't expect to see you.
you wish to say something?
I came to apologise, my Lord.
good.
I didn't mean to rile you.
I thought only of Gwen.
the poor girl is all alone in this world.
it was not my intention to hurt your maid.
I know.
but now she suffers.
and I know how she must suffer.
Morgana... I only meant,
I know what it's like to lose a father.
that was a terrible day. Your father was a great friend.
I had no part in his death.
you sent him into battle.
you promised him reinforcements and then gave him none.
you sent him to his death. That is not true.
it was never my intention. But it happened!
and it keeps on happening.
Morgana! I'm sorry, my lord.
do you think Uther's a good King?
sorry?
Uther. Do you think he's good for the Kingdom?
Yes. Yes, I do.
in the light of recent events, you may find that hard to believe.
hard? No. Impossible? Definitely.
Merlin... Everyone hates him.
it is not Uther's job to be liked.
it is Uther's job to protect the Kingdom.
most of his methods are right.
sometimes he may go too far. Really?
you mean like executing anyone who even passes a sorcerer on the street?
Yes.
despite Uther's failings, he has brought peace and prosperity to this Kingdom.
but at what cost?
at the cost of women and children, fathers and sons!
when will it end?
it will end when Arthur is King.
then why not let that time be now?
why not let Arthur be King?
Arthur's not ready.
the responsibility would be too great.
brave though he may be, he lacks experience, he lacks judgment.
is there anything you want to tell me?
I can't... I just.
no, I can't. You've just got to trust me.
Gaius, it's something I've got to work out for myself.
I do trust you, Merlin.
whatever it is,
I know you'll make the right decision.
Morgana!
I'm not disturbing you, I hope?
not at all.
these are difficult times.
they put a strain on us all.
Yes, my lord.
I cannot tell you how much it pains me to be at odds with you.
and I with you.
I've been thinking about what you said.
and I realise I may have been insensitive.
I should have foreseen the distress that your maid's loss would cause you, that it would stir old memories.
I've opened an old wound.
for that, I'm sorry.
my Lord, it gladdens my heart to hear these words.
I too wish to heal these wounds.
let us visit my father's grave together and put the past behind us.
nothing would give me greater happiness.
shall we leave tomorrow at first light?
I will make arrangements.
so, My Lady, what news?
Uther has fallen for the bait.
we ride out in the morning for the Old Cairn on the hill.
are you sure you're committed to this?
more than ever I want Uther dead as much as you.
as much as anyone in this rotten Kingdom of his.
then the deed is as good as done.
Merlin?
Gwen. How are you doing?
I was about to ask you the same question.
I'm fine. Fine.
Morgana's been amazing these last few days.
I think you've been amazing.
after all that's happened, getting your life back together...
it's better than sitting in an empty house, waiting for my father to walk through the door.
the thing I find hardest to bear is that people will always think he was guilty because he tried to escape.
I know he was innocent.
I think he tried to escape because he knew that whatever he said or did he'd be killed.
Uther had already made up his mind.
that's the kind of man he is.
I wouldn't blame you if you wanted him dead.
if Uther died I'd feel nothing.
he means nothing to me.
but if you had, you know, the choice, what would you do?
if you had the power of life and death over Uther, would you kill him?
for what he did?
No!
no?
what would that solve?
that would make me a murderer.
that would make me as bad as him.
you're right.
of course you're right.
is anything wrong?!
no, no. See you later!
do you think that we could have some privacy?
fine. Wait here. We're in no danger.
father...
Ackwele!
your father was the greatest man I've ever known.
he stood for everything this kingdom represents.
truth, justice, valour.
a hundred times he saved my life on the battlefield.
his courage and his honour were without equal.
when Gorlois died, I lost the truest friend I ever had.
for he was as fearless in questioning my judgment as he was in defending my kingdom.
that's the mark of a true friend.
I know how he respected you, my lord.
but I don't share these memories.
how can I? I was ten years old.
I only know I loved him and he was taken from me.
when he died, and I took you into my care, you fought me from the beginning.
your will is as strong as my own.
you challenge me as a friend must.
as your father did in his time.
but when I do, you clap me in irons.
I know I'm not an easy man.
my temper blinds me sometimes.
there are things that I regret.
Gwen's father?
Yes.
are you saying you were wrong to have Tom killed?
Yes.
Ackwele!
I will strive to listen to you more and quarrel with you less.
you've been a blessing to me, Morgana.
you are the daughter I never had.
your counsel is invaluable, as is your friendship and your love.
without you, I can not hold the king as the land desires
my lord .Please forgive me, Morgana.
No!
die, Uther Pendragon!
Ah. Busy day? Had its moments.
I hear that Tauren tried to assassinate Uther.
that's what I hear. And that Morgana saved him.
how many men were there? Three? Four?
Yeah, something like that.
Morgana must have shown extraordinary courage to have defended a king against such odds.
I suppose you had nothing to do with it?
Oh, you know. Just background stuff.
no need to be so modest, Merlin.
sorry.
it's not a criticism.
it's a compliment. Right.
Thanks, Gaius.
somebody help me!
please, Merlin.
this is only the beginning
you should not have killed my friend.
in a land of myth and a time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young boy.
his name...
Merlin.
father, we're not going into battle.
you don't have to look so sombre.
never before have the rulers of the five kingdoms come together in this way.
never before have we all worked towards the same aim, towards peace.
if these talks are successful,
Camelot will enter a new era of prosperity.
if they fail, it will almost certainly mean war.
boy! Is it too much to ask that you might anticipate my needs?
sorry, master. I was...
stop whinging. Sorry, master.
Alined! You are most welcome on this momentous occasion.
Momentous? Let us hope so.
Uther may think that we are gathered here for peace, but that is far from my mind.
am I to take it that Lady Vivian is part of our plan?
she is very lovely.
don't let her father hear you say that.
not if you value your head.
indeed I do! It is my prettiest feature.
Olaf is the most over-protective buffoon I've ever met.
it would surely end the peace talks if anyone were to lay a finger on her.
but nobody in their right mind would do that.
but Arthur won't be in his right mind...will he?
what kind of welcome is this? You have us hanging around like the last swallows of summer.
you are welcome indeed, Olaf.
may I present my daughter, the Lady Vivian.
lady Vivian.
how like your mother you are.
I hope everything is to your satisfaction?
it is...adequate.
most of our guests are extremely happy here.
I am sure you will be too.
I am not most of your guests.
In...deed.
well, may I present Guinevere?
she'll be looking after you for the duration of your stay.
you will want for nothing. She is truly one of Camelot's finest.
then I fear for Camelot.
good luck with that one. Mmm.
I need to prepare for the feast.
Merlin?
what kind of impression do you think this gives?
that we have moths.
fetch me another.
and who might you be trying to impress, sire?
well, let me see...
perhaps the five kings sitting in the banquet hall below.
not the king's daughter, then?
the Lady Vivian, she is very beautiful.
anyone trying to impress the Lady Vivian does so at extreme peril.
Olaf would have their head in a vat of hot oil before they'd said hello.
besides, she's not my type.
she may be beautiful but she's incredibly rude.
you should've heard what she said to Gwen.
anyone insulting Gwen should do so at extreme peril What?
nothing. I just know how you feel about her, that's all.
that is, if your feelings haven't changed.
which I presume they haven't.
I do have my own vat of hot oil, you know.
you're blushing.
no, I'm not.
what's wrong with Gwen? Nothing.
I think she is very worthy of your love.
indeed. Were it so.
Which...it is.
Merlin?
Yes, Arthur?
get out.
Yes, sire.
but it is not enough to please just the gentlemen of the court.
now I have a spectacle for the ladies.
it is skill indeed. We aim to please.
but what is this?
lady Vivian...
it has mistaken you for a beautiful flower.
ales... Lufie he hi thonne he onwaecth.
bith his hyht thaet he her seon mote ana oftor thonne ealle men.
sleep well, Prince Arthur, and when you wake, may your thoughts be only of Vivian.
Heo haefth thin heort.
sweet dreams.
good morning, sire Never have you been more right, Merlin!
it is the sunniest, the most fragrant, most beautiful morning I've ever seen in my life.
you're dressed?
I am the future King of Camelot, I do have some skills.
indeed. You are very skilled...
at getting people to do things for you.
that is your job.
but today my job is to woo.
to what?
to woo.
I wish to make a proclamation of love.
Really? I thought you wanted to keep your feelings secret
why would I want to do that?
by the end of today, I will have won my lady.
right... What will you tell your father?
what does my father matter?
well, that's one way of approaching things.
so, I need your help in expressing my feelings.
of course.
how do I express my feelings? Oh, I see... Um...
feelings... Feelings.
girls... Girls.
flowers? Excellent.
find some.
perhaps you should also send a note. Brilliant idea.
something moving.
something from the heart.
something...
you'll think of something.
Gwen? Gwen?
the barriers that keep us apart are nothing compared to the power of true love, Arthur.
your demands are noted and will be taken into consideration in due course.
in the meantime, is there anyone else who has comments about the Northern Territories?
did you do it? Left them in her room.
I thought that better than a public display.
you sure she got them?
I'm sure she WILL get them. Good!
well, all we can do now is wait...
Oh, but heaven has blessed me.
she's even more beautiful than before. Don't you agree?
I'm surprised to hear you talk so openly. Nonsense.
I want to tell the world. I want to shout it across the kingdom.
are you sure that's a good idea?
I understand your feelings but other people may object.
object?
to what? Well, you're the future King of Camelot and she is serving girl, albeit a very nice serving girl.
lady Vivian is of royal blood, a future queen.
I will have your head if I hear such insolence again.
lady Vivian?
Oh, no.
Merlin...Can't you knock?
rats. What?
big, hairy, sharp teeth.
Yeah, definitely, under here.
are you feeling all right? Me? Never better.
you?
I'm having a very surprising day. Really?
you know one of those occasions when you've lost all hope and then out of the blue something happens to restore your faith
sort of.
well, that's what's happened to me today.
I may have caused a problem. Although it wasn't entirely my doing
what now, Merlin? Arthur's in love.
how did you cause that? That bit isn't my fault.
the other bit is. I can't tell you about that bit.
clear as mud.
Arthur is besotted. He can't concentrate on anything.
all he thinks about, all he talks about is...
it's the Lady Vivian.
the Lady Vivian? How could that have happened so suddenly?
I don't know.
something doesn't feel right.
only yesterday, he dismissed her as rude.
if Arthur professes his love for Vivian, Olaf will be furious.
surely Arthur knows that?
see, he said it was his job to woo his lady by the end of the day
then it is your job to stop him.
who is it? It is destiny, my love.
destiny and chicken.
what a beautiful combination, eh?
the beans are a little cold, but the meat is very good.
go away. My love
I do not know what I have done to offend you.
your love? Not now, nor ever.
come now... My father will kill you if he finds you here.
your father does not worry me.
you won't say that when he's running at you with a knife in his hand.
I've seen it before.
Really? Yes.
just five minutes? My lord.
I don't think your advances are welcome.
go away, and take your chicken with you!
I don't know what gives you that impression.
damn it! Every woman in the land is attracted to this boy.
I'm almost attracted to him myself.
not Lady Vivian, my lord.
we have until the end of tomorrow to scupper these talks.
I need war, do you understand?
Oh, yes, I do. I do. Peace will make me poor.
and you know what happens to poor kings?
they can't afford castles...
or knights...or jesters.
but Master... Enough.
there will be time for snivelling when the axe is over your head.
now there is work to be done.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
go on, Merlin, say it.
what?
you do not think I should pursue my love.
I think a number of things stand in the way of a happy union between you and Lady Vivian. Her blood-thirsty father for one.
her complete lack of interest for another.
might it be worthwhile returning to your old love?
although, I have my reservations about that as well.
what are you talking about? Melin, I don't have an old love.
what on earth...?
you really need to start paying attention to the details.
I knew something wasn't right. Arthur's enchanted.
I should've realised he had magic.
no-one can make butterflies appear from thin air.
trickler.
why would he want Arthur to fall in love with Vivian?
an advance by Arthur would ruin the conference.
maybe Alined wants war. Without creating it himself.
it is the sort of cowardly behaviour you would expect from him.
cowardly, but clever.
we need to find a way of turning Arthur back to normal.
before it's too late.
lady Vivian...my love...
breakfast.
there are over 636 love spells in these books, and over 150 of them involve a lock of hair.
is there no way we can narrow them down a bit? I have. Look
if I choose this one and it's wrong,
Arthur will end up as a toad.
and if this one's wrong, Vivian will lose all her hair.
Olaf might not declare war for that, but she certainly would!
Fleoge hraeg.
Gwen has been detained. I thought you might appreciate breakfast
Ah, thank you. How kind! I'm so happy this morning
I could almost forget to eat.
Oh, but that looks wonderful.
really wonderful. Pray, my lady what has caused such happiness?
I cannot tell, so do not ask.
intriguing... You know another meaning of jester is "keeper of secrets."
Really? No.
Oh, Trickler. You mustn't tell. Not a soul.
especially not my father. Go on...
I am in love.
how wonderful. With me?
with a man more courageous than a lion, stronger than an ox, and so perfectly formed it is as if he had been sculpted by the gods themselves.
but it must be me?
Oh, just to speak his name brings me pleasure indeed.
then speak it you should.
Arthur.
there! I've said it. My heart belongs to Arthur.
excellent.
in fact, I'm going to tell him now. A brilliant idea.
where is Gwen? I must dress.
but you look so beautiful, my lady.
how could he refuse you like this?
in my night gown? Why not?
what is it, Arthur?
you look like you have something on your mind.
you read me like a book.
I have made a fool of myself, that's all. That is...everything.
I'm sure that is not true.
you have a good heart, Guinevere, but I'm afraid it is.
I have made...a gesture, and it was not well received.
you're sure? Pretty sure.
then you are wrong.
you are very close to the lady in question.
your token was much appreciated.
but the situation is delicate and it is not always easy to express what is really in one's heart.
you think there's hope?
there is always hope.
if only I had some way of knowing.
indeed, my lord.
I wish to see Arthur. Your master.
my lord. Your what?
my heart's delight.
Oh, no.
where is he?
he's not here. Which is a very good thing, I believe.
then I shall wait.
I don't think that's a good idea. You're not even dressed.
my love does not care what I wear, only that I am near.
now fetch him.
I cannot. You will.
I shan't.
as he commands you, I command you I am asking you to leave
I want my love. I need my love.
I want to see him now.
and so moving on to our final point for discussion the boundaries of the Eastern Territories.
this is a point that I am willing to concede.
that is very generous.
excuse me, sire? One moment.
What?!
where is he?
what's that?
Oh, no... Oh, no!
OK, you need to go.
you cannot keep us apart. It is written in the stars.
Vivian and Arthur, a love for all time.
a love stronger than time! A love...
Swefe nu!
why are you hanging around like a bad smell?
it's me who needs to bathe.
I'm not going to win my love stinking like an old kipper.
no, my lord.
where is she? I know she's in here, Arthur!
hand her over or feel my wrath.
what's he talking about? She wasn't even dressed.
if I have dishonoured you in some way then by all means provide me with proof and I'll face the consequences.
Trickler here tells me that the Lady Vivian is in your chambers.
if only that were true.
if only that were true, you would not look so foolish.
search the room. You'd better hope I don't find her.
Behaepse faest!
that hasn't opened in years.
buffoon! You've made an idiot of me.
I am so terribly sorry, Arthur, to have disturbed you.
I do hope that you will forgive me.
check on the Lady Vivian, and remain outside her room!
if only the Lady Vivian were in my room.
how delightful that would be, eh, Merlin?
Merlin?
Merlin?
it's that meddlesome Merlin. He's onto us, my lord.
there was nothing I could do. You do understand, master?
say you forgive your boy?
you have a matter of hours before the peace treaty is signed.
that is time enough, master.
time enough. It's less time than you've had already, and you haven't managed it so far.
but the enchantment is strong, my lord.
sooner or later, the two will be drawn together.
for the sake of your prettiest feature, you had better believe that to be the case.
this is indeed a momentous day for the five kingdoms.
this peace treaty has been long in the making.
but I know you must be keen to return to your families, so we will make preparations for the signing ceremony immediately.
I am pleased, friends. Very pleased.
as are we all.
that's it. I've got it . you sure?
you're not going to turn Arthur into a hunchback camel or a horny eyed toad?
I'll save that for another day.
a second chance"?
sunset.
I'll await your presence.
at last.
Arthur? Arthur?
I'll find out.
is there a problem, Uther? No, not at all.
Arthur's just running a little late, that's all.
as is the Lady Vivian.
my love. Always. For ever.
Abuge aglaeccraeft.
Abuge aglaeccraeft.
Abuge aglaeccraeft!
I knew it. I don't believe it.
father! We've got something to tell you.
Arthur!
father?
you once said that if you truly offended my honour, then you would happily pay the price.
what say you now, Prince Arthur?
how have I offended your honour? Surely not with my love alone.
love?! You don't know the first thing about love.
you're taking advantage of an innocent girl. Father...?
Arthur! I assure you, my feelings for your daughter are as real as they are strong.
Unhand her or suffer the consequences.
is this really worth risking your life for? Arthur?
indeed it is. I would rather die than deny my feelings.
I love your daughter... with all my heart.
it's no good. I have spoken to Olaf.
he will not rescind the challenge.
he says his honour has been tainted. He demands recompense.
you didn't have to do that, Father.
the fight is to the death. What did you think you were doing?
you cannot help who you fall in love with.
you do you realise your actions threaten the peace talks, and it may yet bring war to Camelot?
I am happy to fight for what I believe in.
what's happened to him? Lady Vivian!
nothing more.
and yet, who could wish for more?
I don't understand it.
Trickler's magic is strong, but surely it can't be stronger than mine?
love potions are strange.
you need to go to Uther. No!
it's a fight to the death.
if Uther realises that one of the kings is using magic, there will certainly be a war.
the only way out of this situation is to unenchant Arthur.
and unenchant him fast!
anything interesting? Haven't you heard?
Arthur was discovered in Lady Vivian's chambers.
what?
king Olaf has demanded recompense.
they are to fight to the death. All for the love of a woman.
and Lady Vivian at that.
you look more shocked than I did. It is very surprising.
I don't know why he couldn't control his feelings.
indeed.
I will miss the tourney if you don't mind.
there's so much to organise here.
but of course.
Guinevere, you will wish me luck?
will I? Haven't you heard?
Oh, yes, I've heard.
though sadly not from your lips.
I wish you could have been more honest with me, Arthur.
what's she talking about?
no idea.
you are pleased, my lord? Do I get to keep my fingers?
Trickler, I shall cast your fingers in gold.
I could not have wished for more.
I told you I would not fail you, my lord.
if Olaf kills Arthur, then Uther will start a war.
if Arthur kills Olaf, then his men will start a war.
we cannot lose!
No!
king Olaf has demanded recompense and by the ancient laws of Camelot, the matter will be settled by a tourney in three stages.
the weapons chosen are quarter staff, mace and sword.
the fight will be according to the Knight's Rules and to the death
are we all clear?
one of your ribs is broken, sire.
nothing can hurt me today.
I'm invincible.
love really can conquer all, Gaius, it's true.
this can't go on.
the fight's not fair. Arthur's head is in the clouds.
I don't know what to do.
then find someone who does.
this is magic indeed.
everything I have tried has failed.
from what you tell me, the spell has captured his heart.
and his heart is controlling his brain.
there is no magic that can break this enchantment.
there must be.
it has too great a hold...
I cannot let Arthur die!
patience young, warlock.
the solution lies in a force greater than you or I can understand
a force that has puzzled many minds.
please, I have very little time.
a force...
just tell me.
why, it is the greatest force of all...
.love.
love?
you must find the person Arthur truly loves.
and then what?
one kiss from her will break the enchantment and he will desire Vivian no more.
are you sure you can carry on, sire?
as long as I have Vivian to gaze at, I can conquer the world.
besides, the mace is my forte. You'll see.
rats again, Merlin?
what? No, no. Um... I need your help.
Arthur needs your help.
I do not think that Arthur needs me.
Gwen, don't worry, I know.
you know what? Everything.
anyone who spends five minutes with you can see how you feel about each other.
look, I do not have time to explain so you have to trust me. Arthur does love you.
no, he doesn't.
if you can't trust me, trust your feelings.
I'm never trusting my feelings again. He's enchanted.
Yes, with Lady Vivian, I can see that.
no, I mean literally enchanted with magic, potions, love juice.
none of his feelings are genuine.
how can you be sure?
when I saw him, his feelings seemed real enough.
Gwen, none of his feelings for Vivian are real.
but if we do not break the spell his death will be.
search your heart - you know who he loves.
have you come to wish me good luck?
I really don't think I need it any more.
no, Arthur, I have not come to wish you luck.
well, honestly, that's rather rude.
then let me make amends.
what am I doing?
you're in a fight. To the death.
you're losing.
but... There is no time to explain.
Just...live for me, Arthur.
that's all I ask right now.
Merlin, if anything should happen to me, look after Gwen.
the world may think she is just a servant, dispensable, but she's not dispensable to me.
this is no way to achieve peace.
I thought I better deliver it myself this time.
I'm sorry...
for what I put you through.
no. You have nothing to apologise for.
I, too, have caused my fair share of hurt.
you must believe that my feelings for...Vivian .were not real.
I've never loved another.
but one day you will.
one day you will find your real princess.
one day you will be King of Camelot.
and I cannot be your Queen.
you don't know that. I am as sure of that as you are.
things may change.
well, until they do...
my lord.
your boy has a very wise head on his shoulders.
no doubt he gets that from you.
I hope that these events will not harm our peace treaty.
Oh, I believe that Vivian was as much to blame as Arthur.
I'll take her away from temptation.
she is far too young to encounter such things.
but yes, I go in peace.
I am very pleased to hear that.
that is more than you deserve, boy.
you will run all the way home.
that's not possible, master. Make it possible.
why so cross, Alined?
anyone would think you didn't want peace?
but of course I do.
Peace...love it.
well, you may return any time to view the treaty.
you're very kind.
we may return, too? You are always welcome.
my heart will remain, and I hope to join it soon.
not too soon.
no, it might conflict with your one true love.
my what? You heard me. I have proof.
proof? You kissed her in the tent.
Merlin? Yes?
what happened in the tent?
speak of it again and I'll kill you.
OK.
the ancient prophecies speak of an alliance 'of Mordred and Morgana united in evil.'
this crystal cannot fall into enemy hands.
is it some kind of weapon?
Mordred will master the crystal and when he does, we will strike Uther down.
this union must be stopped...
whatever the cost.'
in a land of myth and a time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young boy.
his name...
Merlin.
Hors, beride tha heofenan...
Hey! Did you see it? The smoke, did you see it?!
no... I saw nothing. Are you blind?! You were right here!
it was magic, I tell you!
there's sorcery here! We must tell the king!
no... Wait!
it was sorcery you saw, you're certain of it? Yes, sire.
and you swear this before your king?
I swear it.
perhaps your eyes deceived you. A trick of the light.
the smoke was alive, I tell you.
I feared for my life.
I thank you for bringing this to my attention.
your loyalty will not go unrewarded.
thank you, sire.
it cannot continue. I will hunt down those responsible, Father.
I promise they will not escape unpunished. No.
stronger methods are called for.
send for the witchfinder.
sire, is it necessary to resort to such measures?
the witchfinder is a trusted ally, Gaius.
his help will be invaluable.
of course.
how many times, Merlin?
how many times must I drive it into that thick skull of yours?
your magic is a secret to be guarded with your life.
what were you thinking? I...
I wasn't thinking. Well, think, boy, think!
it was just a bit of fun. It was magic and it was seen.
you're right... I'm sorry. You must hide the book.
anything that can connect you to sorcery in any way.
what, now? Yes, now, Merlin.
the man that Uther has sent for...
I know him. The witchfinder?
some know him by that name.
I know him as Aredian. He is a force to be reckoned with.
but I'm not a witch.
look, no dress or anything...
I'll get the book.
I am expected.
is that him? Yes.
what's that cage for? It hardly bears thinking about.
so where has he been all this time? In foreign lands.
wherever the pursuit of sorcery takes him.
he does all this in your name?
the witchfinder serves no-one. He is a law unto himself.
do you smell it?
do you smell it, Uther?
Aredian... It's all around us.
the foul stench of sorcery.
it's infected your great city like a contagion.
I welcome you to Camelot, Aredian.
thank you for making such haste to be here.
well, let's hope I am not too late, hmm?
for every hour counts in the war against sorcery.
unchecked, it spreads like a disease.
it seeks out the young and the old, the weak and the able, the fair and the foul of heart alike.
you have grown lazy, Uther.
you have grown idle.
your once noble Camelot is rotten to the core.
you stand on the brink of dark oblivion.
I am at your disposal, Aredian.
the knights will aid you in any way they can.
you must be Arthur.
I must be.
you are a great warrior.
the finest this kingdom has ever known.
thank you...
so you won't be offended when I say that
I shall have no need of you or your knights.
the subtle craft of sorcery can only be fought by yet subtler means.
methods honed over decades of study.
methods known only to myself.
we are grateful for your help.
gratitude alone can't keep a man alive
you must put food in his belly.
I will pay your price, Aredian, whatever it may be.
I will bid you good night.
Aredian?
when do you begin?
I have already begun.
Gaius, isn't it?
I never forget a face.
nor I, Aredian.
a physician now, I hear.
you always did have a thirst for knowledge.
scientific knowledge. Of course.
my assistant, Merlin.
Merlin...
may your investigations prove fruitful, Aredian.
however, you'll have to excuse us, we have work to do.
naturally. Merlin?
I have a few questions I would like you to answer.
please be at my chambers in an hour.
you are aware, then, that sorcery has been practised in the vicinity of Camelot?
Yes. I mean...
apparently. No, it cannot be denied.
there was a witness.
Yes, I know.
did you also know that the woman has named you as a witness?
but...
I have already spoken to her. She was quite clear on the matter.
but I wasn't a witness. Sorry, perhaps I misheard.
do you deny that you were present at the time of the incident?
no. I was there.
so you saw it, the horse conjured from the smoke?
I saw the smoke, but it was only smoke.
I saw nothing else. Are you saying that she lies?
no, I didn't say that. I said I didn't see what she saw.
hmm. How can that be, I wonder?
how can one person see something and the other not?
I can't explain it.
I am at a loss as to explain it myself.
unless it was you who performed the magic.
it wasn't. Can you prove that it wasn't?
no.
that will be all.
for now.
speak. Do not be afraid.
I... I was drawing water from the well, sire, when I saw them.
faces...
in the water, sire. Terrible faces...
like people who were drowned...
screaming... Screaming...
I haven't done anything, I promise.
tell them what you saw.
a goblin.
dancing on the coals, it was. Dancing in the flames.
and it spoke, sire...
my heart near stopped for fear of it.
as you have heard, my lord, the incident in the woods was only the beginning.
there was a sorcerer, sire, in the square.
there were creatures jumping right out of his mouth.
what manner of creature?
toads, sire. Great, green, slimy things as big as your fist!
the sorcerer laughs in your face.
even now, magic flourishes on the streets of Camelot.
I scarcely believe it. Yet it is the truth, my lord.
fortunately, I have utilised every facet of my craft to bring this matter to a swift resolution.
the sorcerer...
you have a suspect?
Oh, I do, my lord.
I regret to say they stand among us in this very room.
my methods are infallible. My findings incontestable.
the facts point to one person and one person alone.
the boy, Merlin.
Merlin?!
you can't be serious. This is outrageous!
you have no evidence!
the tools of magic cannot be hidden from me.
I am certain that a thorough search of the boy's chamber will deliver us all we need.
Merlin?
I have nothing to hide from him.
very well. Guards, restrain the boy.
let the search begin.
careful, please!
that's my life's work!
comb every inch. The sorcerer is a master of concealment.
there's nothing here, Aredian. I'll be the judge of that.
over there, behind this tapestry. And there, upend that stool.
be sure to check for hollow legs.
there, within those powder jars.
here!
an amulet of enchantment.
were you aware, physician, that your assistant kept instruments of sorcery?
no.
well, our work is done.
I must inform the king.
Aredian!
I know for certain that the amulet does not belong to Merlin.
Oh? Well, who does it belong to, then?
it belongs to me.
you're free to go.
Gaius! What's going on?
say nothing, Merlin. Do nothing. Promise me!
Gaius has served me with unfailing dedication.
without his knowledge, his wisdom,
I would not be sitting here today.
you have shown great faith in him, sire. Great faith indeed...
considering that he was known to practise sorcery.
Gaius? Mmm.
you're mistaken. No, Arthur.
he speaks the truth.
I am well aware of his past, but I have every reason to believe he has turned his back on sorcery.
until now. We don't know that.
this amulet you found could just be a stupid mistake.
or maybe he has fallen back into old habits.
we must give him the benefit of the doubt, surely?
Why?
anyway, there is a sure way to establish his guilt.
I know your methods are effective, Aredian, but Gaius is an old man, he could not withstand such... treatment.
it is the only way to rid your mind of doubt.
what time is it?
time for you to confess.
the amulet was a relic from the past, a keepsake.
but such artefacts are banned on pain of death, surely you must know this?
I was wrong to have kept it.
I am grievously sorry for it.
well, that's a good start.
it's an excellent start.
but not nearly enough, I'm afraid.
Aredian, I... Guards!
was your conscience clear when you practised magic in the days of the great purge?
I have not used magic for many years...
your assistant kept instruments of sorcery...
it belongs to me. So if someone else were to practise magic... No
No! If you're an enemy of this kingdom you're an enemy of your king. No!
my conscience is clear.
I'd like a drink of water, please.
and you shall have one. When you have confessed.
then I shall die of thirst, Aredian.
what is wrong, young warlock? You look so pale.
I did a stupid thing. A stupid, stupid thing!
and now Gaius is going to die for it!
Gaius means nothing to me.
but he means a great deal to me!
very well, tell me what has happened.
a witchfinder has come.
he's arrested Gaius for sorcery, but I am the sorcerer.
Yes, I suppose you are.
well, I'm going to confess. It's the only way to save him.
then your stupidity continues.
I won't sacrifice a friend to save myself!
bravely spoken.
but Gaius is already doomed.
if you confess, the witchfinder will just burn you both.
but it's my fault! Don't you understand?
all too well, young warlock, but understand this
if you were to die, you would endanger the lives of all those that rely upon you.
there must be something I can do. There must be.
please, help me.
Merlin, I see you are distressed by this.
but I cannot help you, because I do not know how to.
I can't just stand by and watch Gaius die.
I can't!
I am sorry.
you're a traitor, you're an imposter.
sorcery is your only master.
I serve only my king.
huh! In what way have you served him?
you have lied to him, you have broken his laws, you have betrayed his trust.
I have saved his life,
I have treated his ward, I have protected his only son!
you have treated his ward?
I have striven to help all those in need.
it is a physician's duty to do so.
the Lady Morgana? Among others.
for what malady does she receive this treatment?
she... she suffers from nightmares.
I see.
but as I said, I feel it is my duty to attend to the needs of...
Yes, yes. You seem very keen to change the subject, Gaius.
perhaps I should question her myself.
there's no need to be concerned, my lady,
I won't detain you long.
there's just a small detail I wish to clarify.
now, it is true, is it not, that you have received treatment for nightmares?
and it was Gaius, the court physician, who administered these treatments, these potions?
Yes.
I'm sorry, could you speak up?
Yes.
thank you. Now, you may go.
you don't happen to know what was in these potions, I suppose?
Oh, no.
no, of course not. You are not a physician, after all.
so, for all you know, these potions could have been magical, your dreams, the product of an enchanted elixir?
Oh, I had these dreams before Gaius started treating me.
but have they got better or worse since Gaius began treating you?
worse.
as I thought.
thank you. You have been most helpful.
Gaius?
are you prepared to confess?
I'd rather die first.
good. And die you shall.
but not alone, I'm pleased to say - you shall have company.
what?
Merlin and the Lady Morgana are to join you in the flames.
No!
this is a trick.
you have corrupted them, Gaius, and they must answer to their king. Unless...
unless what?
confess! Confess!
I am a sorcerer, sire.
I am responsible for conjuring the smoke.
I am guilty of practising magic in Camelot.
the goblin, the faces in the well...
I am the sorcerer who conjured the toad from his mouth.
you have betrayed me, Gaius.
you have betrayed your friends.
but above all, you have betrayed yourself.
by the laws of Camelot, I must sentence you...
..to death.
the sorcerer will be purged of his magic by means of fire!
he shall be burned at the stake tomorrow at dawn!
bear witness and heed this lesson!
you are a liar!
guards! You are a liar!
I'll deal with this.
I know you're upset, I know you're angry, it's all right. I'm not throwing you in jail.
then what are you doing?
I'm breaking the law.
I can only give you a few minutes.
they wouldn't let me see you. There was nothing I could do...
I know... I understand.
I can't believe it. I can't believe Uther could do this to you.
he had no choice. Once Aredian had found the amulet...
I didn't even know you had such a thing. It isn't mine.
why did you say it was? I was trying to protect you.
I don't know what to say. It's all right, Merlin, you don't have to say anything.
Yeah, I do. The amulet isn't mine either.
then how did it get there?
Aredian. Aredian?
there's no other explanation.
but why?
all that matters is if I can prove he planted it, you're saved!
no. You must let this go.
you are falsely accused. I have a chance to prove that.
I must take that chance. No, you must not.
I don't understand.
do you want to die? No. But neither do I want you to die.
and die you surely will if you get too close to Aredian.
he will trap you, Merlin, he will manipulate you, and without ever meaning to, you will incriminate yourself...
but...
you must let this go.
I must let you go?
to do otherwise would be an act of suicide.
Ah, Gaius. I hope you have found some relief, now that your ordeal is over.
your concern is touching, Aredian.
now, will you please get out of my sight? Of course.
I just thought you'd want to hear the news, that's all...
what news?
my investigations have begun.
begun? But you've already extracted my confession.
indeed.
which just leaves Merlin and the Lady Morgana.
but we struck a bargain!
PAH! I don't bargain with sorcerers.
Merlin?
he won't let go! He won't stop. What happened?
the witchfinder's questioning Morgana again.
I'm worried, Merlin. She's close to breaking point.
that's what he does.
he breaks you down.
in the end, you confess whether you're guilty or not.
what do you mean?
Gaius was set up. Aredian planted that amulet.
but why would he do such a thing?
Aredian is paid to catch sorcerers.
maybe he doesn't care if someone is guilty or not.
maybe he gets confessions by lying, by planting evidence.
as long as he gets a confession, he gets his money.
even if this is true, what can we do without proof?
get some.
Tospringe...
Daefte thaet bedd...
this is hopeless. Keep looking.
we don't even know whether this flower means anything.
no, we don't, but it's all we've got.
here. Belladonna.
for the alleviation of ulcers, allergies,
muscular inflammation...
this is hopeless, Merlin.
wait, listen - "Under certain conditions, a tincture of the flower can produce hallucinations.
so?
Aredian's witnesses. It wasn't magic they were seeing, it was visions.
it makes sense.
if he's faking the evidence... But how can we prove it?
Aredian's too clever to have given the tincture to them directly
they must've got it from someone else.
they could've been getting it from anyone.
is there anything, anything at all that these people had in common?
they were all women. But that doesn't tell us anything.
Yes, it does! What's the one thing only women would buy?
things to make them look beautiful.
Gwen?
do you sell a tincture of belladonna?
what's this all about? Please, it's important.
well, I think I've got some somewhere.
but what you'd be wanting with eye drops in the middle of the night, I really don't want to know.
eye drops? Yes women use them to make their eyes more beautiful.
where did you get this? Well, my usual suppliers.
are you sure you didn't get it from someone else?
of course I'm sure.
now, if it's all the same to you, I'd like to get some sleep.
it was Aredian who gave you the belladonna. Isn't it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
but you know that Gaius will be executed tomorrow, don't you?
that has nothing to do with me.
that has everything to do with you.
Aredian's witnesses saw visions.
visions produced by the belladonna in these eye drops.
if we can prove this, we have a chance of saving Gaius.
He...forced me to sell it.
he said he'd kill me if I said anything to anyone.
but it was him?
it was Aredian?
Yes. It was him.
thank you. Thank you.
that's it. We've got everything we need. But is it enough?
we've got a witness as well, surely that's enough.
it's still just our word against Aredian's.
Gwen, we don't have a choice!
by dawn tomorrow, Gaius will be dead!
Merlin, we've got only one chance we've got to give Uther something he cannot deny, something not even Aredian can talk his way out of.
I'll be as quick as I can!
Hly...
Hlyste min nexte bebod...
Ceolwaerc...
come on, Merlin, come on...
good morning, Gaius.
Merlin! Where have you been?
it's done. Everything's in place.
but it's too late. Gaius has already left the dungeons!
then... Then we have to delay the execution!
how?! Arthur... I'll speak to Arthur.
no
leave Arthur to me.
easy there! Show him some respect!
sorry. Excuse me...excuse me...
I need to get through... Sorry...
excuse me...
Arthur! Arthur, Arthur, you've got to stop this.
I can't, Gwen. You know I can't.
Merlin has proof that Gaius is innocent!
my father has passed sentence. Nothing I can do.
you can do the right thing, Arthur Pendragon!
you can show some faith in a loyal friend, or stand by and watch an innocent man die.
Guinevere... You did it once before to my father.
are you really willing to let it happen again?
and you can stop looking at me like that.
I know I'm only a servant.
I thought you were a prince. So start behaving like one.
wait!
sire, the witnesses saw nothing but hallucinations...
..induced by the belladonna in these eye-drops.
and you bought this belladonna from this man?
where did you get it from?
don't be afraid. No harm will come to you here.
the witchfinder...
he gave them to me. Did he tell you what it was for?
no.
only that if I did not sell it, he'd have me burnt at the stake.
how do you answer to these accusations? They are absurd.
the boy has clearly concocted these lies in the hope of saving his master.
then you won't mind if we search your chambers?
Silence! You have no authority here.
father, let's settle this once and for all.
if what Merlin says is wrong, then he must bear the consequences.
but if there is some truth in what he says...
I have nothing to hide.
you're wasting your time. The cupboard over there.
these things don't belong to me!
this is a trick!
that boy plots against me!
sorcerer!
Aredian, think very carefully about what you are doing.
you'll never escape from Camelot alive.
I will if you value the life of your ward.
Forbearnan!
Gaius.
I'm glad I found you here.
as am I, my lord.
I thought I would never see these chambers again.
if anything was damaged in the search,
I will be only too glad to replace it.
you're very kind, my lord.
Aredian...
I can still scarcely believe that he was a sorcerer.
indeed.
was there some reason you wished to see me?
yes... I...
I wanted to say, I'm sorry if you suffered at his hands.
but I did not suffer at his hands, Uther.
I suffered at yours. He worked for you, my lord.
he was merely following your orders.
but I was deceived... No.
you were deceived long before Aredian, for you deceived yourself.
you see foes where there are friends, you see sorcerers where there are but servants.
I am not the first to be wrongly accused in your war against magic.
and not all have been as lucky as I.
I assure you, Gaius, every measure will be taken to ensure that nothing like this will happen again.
I hope that is true.
for all our sakes.
now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.
what I don't understand is how you knew he'd concealed evidence in his chamber.
Oh, just a hunch, really. I see.
and the toad? That...
I...er...can't explain.
I can hardly explain it myself.
unless, of course...
you put it there.
OK, Gaius, fair enough,
I promise I will never save your life again.
promise? Absolutely.
honestly, Merlin, the toad was a step too far.
I know, I know, but you should have seen the look on his face!
my name is Morgause.
you think that Morgause knows the true circumstances of Arthur's birth?
I fear that more than anything.
I want to hear what she knows about my mother.
maybe we should turn back.
the woods could be full of Odin's men.
you're nothing but a hypocrite and a liar!
they're going to kill each other!
in a land of myth and a time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young boy.
his name...Merlin.
Gebeode ic pone feorhberendne paere ealdan ae.
calm yourself, my pretty.
we are home now.
Gaius, there have been disturbing rumours from outlying villages.
sire?
someone, some kind of physician, is offering treatments.
I fear magic may have been used.
what is it that makes you suspicious?
there are reports... of miracle cures.
a boy thrown from a horse, a farmhand mauled by a boar.
all hopeless cases, it seems.
and yet each and every one has made a full recovery.
it is very hard for me to comment, sire.
I would have to examine the patients myself.
that won't be necessary...
as a new case has arisen here in Camelot.
who? The innkeeper.
he has returned to work.
that's not possible
the condition was critical. I saw him only days ago.
Gaius, So you agree that magic must be involved?
well, I couldn't say for sure.
then go to the tavern and find out.
if sorcery is at work here, we must act quickly.
Yes, sire, I'll see to it right away.
it's unbelievable.
Uther has no problem turning to magic if his family are threatened
keep your voice down, Merlin.
he is such a hypocrite!
he's also the King.
so if you value your head, use it.
welcome!
Gaius, what a pleasant surprise.
Evoric.
what can I get you?
nothing, I just dropped in to see how you were doing.
much improved, as you can see.
indeed.
a remarkable recovery.
all thanks to you, Gaius.
I think not.
Evoric, I am, of course, delighted that you are well again, but I must ask you
from whom did you obtain your remedy?
I don't know what you're talking about.
you mustn't be afraid. I am not the King, after all.
my wife, she was desperate.
I was slipping away. Go on.
she met a woman, a healer, in the Lower Town and she gave her a cure.
can I see it?
interesting.
am I in some kind of trouble?
no, not at all.
you've been most helpful.
what was the nature of this treatment?
Hogwart and fenugreek.
excuse me?
herbs, sire.
whoever prescribed them was highly skilled.
their grasp of the five principles of herbal conjoinment was...
what about the boy, and the labourer?
surely they were beyond the help of such remedies?
not necessarily, sire.
the physician's art can achieve great things.
but not miracles!
the innkeeper was fatally ill. You said so yourself.
Yes, that was indeed my diagnosis.
but my knowledge isn't perfect.
there are many branches of my craft are yet mysteries to me.
I could not heal the innkeeper.
someone else could.
are you absolutely satisfied that no magic was involved?
entirely, sire.
thank you, Gaius. You have set my mind at rest.
my lord.
I think it's great what you did.
protecting the innkeeper like that.
what do you mean?
he was a sick man.
it was a matter of life and death. Magic was his only hope.
but he didn't use magic.
the potion was enchanted. I saw it with my own eyes.
we both did.
what you saw, Merlin, was a release of gaseous pressure.
entirely normal in a preparation of that kind.
but what about the totem? What totem?
the totem. In the innkeeper's doorway.
it bore the marks of the Old Religion.
nonsense.
you're obviously tired, Merlin.
I recommend you get some sleep. Well, ca...?
Gaius?
Alice.
how did you know I was in Camelot?
I recognised your work.
your healing magic was always equal to none.
Oh, Gaius, you've lost none of your charm.
you've lost none of your skill.
you saved the innkeeper's life.
I did what I could.
as I know you did.
but my humble potion was not enough, it seems.
look at you.
always so solemn.
so serious.
and you, always teasing me.
I've missed you.
and I you.
20 years. And here we are back in Camelot, together again.
it almost seems as though nothing has changed.
and some things never will.
Uther.
it's not safe for you here.
he suspects that magic is at work in Camelot.
but he doesn't know for sure?
not yet.
but if you stay, he will find you.
but, Gaius, healing is my only gift.
it is my living.
I must buy food, I must pay rent.
but why here? The dangers are too great.
because I wanted to see you again.
dawn is almost upon us.
I must get back.
Oh. You will come back tomorrow? Please?
of course.
you have done well. The physician is vital to our plan.
Please...Must we use him this way?
I've told you before. Uther trusts him.
he alone can get us close enough to the King.
he will be blamed for everything that happens.
and you will not. How perfect.
but his punishment will be terrible.
you must put aside your feelings and do what needs to be done.
Yes.
did you...go out last night?
Yes. I had to get some herbs. Herbs?
a...a new supplier. Just arrived. Right.
do your suppliers normally kiss you?
you followed me! How dare you?
Gaius, it was the middle of the night,
I was worried. I thought you might be in some sort of trouble.
there's nothing wrong.
what's her name?
Alice.
she's an old friend.
well, more than a friend, if truth be told.
what do you mean?
we were once engaged to be married.
when was this?
more years ago than I care to remember.
I had just been made physician to the King when I met her.
it was like finding a kindred spirit.
we had so much in common.
our love of science, of healing...
magic?
I was just a novice.
but Alice's power and ability was uncanny.
she had the gift. Soon she had mastered every aspect of sorcery, healing above all.
it was wonderful to behold, Merlin.
she saved a great many lives.
it was Alice that cured the innkeeper. Indeed.
there was a time when her skills were famous in Camelot.
so what happened?
Uther declared war on magic.
overnight our world was turned upside down.
the Great Purge.
Uther drew up a list of everyone suspected of using magic.
one by one they were hunted down and executed.
as a close friend of the King, I was permitted to see this list.
Alice's name was on it.
what did you do? The only thing I could do.
I struck her name off.
Gaius, if you'd been caught...
I know. But it bought her time.
just enough to get out of Camelot, to escape.
but you...stayed behind?
I was scared. I felt... I had no choice.
I thought I'd never see her again.
but now here she is.
after all these years, I feel we've been given a second chance.
you have a kind heart. You always did.
it's the least I could do.
will you stay? Please say you will.
you are my only appointment for this morning. I made sure of that.
you recognise them? Of course. It is a totem of healing.
come, is that the best you can do?
have you forgotten all that we learned together?
let us see. It is a sorcerer's chime - to give it its proper name.
each crystal bears an elemental sign of the Old Religion.
when enchanted, the crystals resonate, their music giving succour to the ailing and the sick.
you have forgotten nothing.
I remember everything.
all that we saw, all that we did, each and every day we spent together.
I remember the day you left.
let's not dwell on that.
we have found each other again. Isn't that all that matters?
come on, Merlin.
put your back into it.
I'm sorry, sire, I'm just a bit...
pathetic.
you're pretending to be a battle-hardened warrior not a...daffodil!
sorry, sire, I'm just a bit tired, that's all.
fair enough.
maybe this will perk you up.
Ah, Merlin. I'd like you to meet Alice.
Merlin, it's a pleasure to meet you.
Gaius speaks very highly of you. You too.
Alice will be staying with us for a while.
great. If that's all right with you?
of course. I'll make up the spare bed.
so you won't mind if she uses your room?
be my guest.
good news, my pretty.
Gaius has taken us into his home.
so he does not suspect? No, no.
then you must work hard to keep it that way. Yes. Yes.
you're doing well.
take some of my venom.
do not fail me. Be careful not to hurt yourself.
that's it.
when you first knew Alice, what kinds of magic did she practise?
all kinds. It was a time of experimentation, of learning.
right. What about dark magic?
I dare say. But those days are long gone.
what if they aren't?
last night, there was some kind of creature in her room.
a creature?
I've never seen anything like it.
it had the body of a lion, and the tail of a scorpion.
come on, Merlin. You must have been dreaming.
no, I saw it. With my own eyes.
and I could feel its power.
it was magic like nothing I've ever felt before.
what utter nonsense!
if you don't believe me, Gaius, I can prove it.
come on.
this is it.
Merlin, put that back. This has gone far enough.
Oh, it's in there. I know it is. Ridiculous.
Gaius, no!
I hope you're satisfied, Merlin.
morning.
hemlock.
nightshade.
Berg...
Oh, Gaius. it's just like old times.
we always made a good team, did we not? Yes.
I wish Merlin had your skills.
I fear he finds the physician's craft boring.
well, never mind. You've got me to help you now, haven't you?
indeed I have.
now, where's the valerian?
Valerian... For an injury, I presume?
perfectly correct. I prescribe it to Uther for an old battle wound.
he takes it daily? Of course.
can I help you?
no.
Yes. I wonder, do you know anything about this creature?
Ah, now, that is the manticore.
a manticore?
nasty-looking beastie, isn't it?
you can say that again.
I believe it was first referred to almost a thousand years ago.
the ancients lived in fear of it, trembled at its very name.
I've never even heard of it.
well, I'm not surprised, because as far as I'm aware the manticore is a legend.
a figment of the imagination.
are you sure?
Oh, yes. So...
if you were hoping to see one,
I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed.
and now it is ready to go to the King.
fascinating.
Gaius, you said you had a rare form of mountain balm.
I should like to compare it with my own, if I may?
certainly. Oh.
now where did I put it?
perhaps with the second-order palliatives?
of course.
I'm so sorry, Gaius.
don't worry. Merlin will clear it up, won't you, Merlin?
won't you, Merlin?
no, no! I can do it.
what's that?
who's there?
no-one. You're dreaming.
now go back to sleep.
Gaius, I need to talk to you about Alice.
Merlin, this must stop.
there's a reason the box was empty.
it's a portal, a gateway for the manticore.
this must stop now.
Alice is up to something, and it isn't good.
you're wrong, Merlin.
Alice is the kindest and most compassionate person
I have ever known. No! You're wrong.
you're just blinded by your feelings for her.
I can see perfectly well, Merlin.
and what I can see is that you cannot bear for me to be happy.
I cannot begin to guess why that should be.
but it saddens me...more than I can say.
Gaius, there you are,
I was beginning to wonder where you'd got to.
what's wrong?
it's nothing.
a disagreement with Merlin, that's all.
was it about me?
you musn't worry.
he's probably a bit jealous, that's all.
jealous?
well, it's only to be expected.
the poor lad's had you all to himself.
he's bound to be a bit hostile for a while.
very hostile, if truth be told.
he'll soon get used to having me around.
I'm sure you're right.
listen, why don't you sit yourself down for a while and take a break.
I must prepare Uther's medicine.
well, I can take care of that. You showed me how, remember?
thank you.
run!
you're meant to bob, Merlin. Weave.
you might as well be a barn door.
Yes, sire.
for goodness sake. What is your problem?
nothing.
right, well, either you tell me, or we go back to the lance and hoops.
Gaius and me, we had a bit of a falling out.
look, I row with my father all the time.
you should do what I do.
just lie low and wait till he comes to his senses.
it'll soon blow over.
no. I don't think so somehow.
Oh, cheer up, will you?
how is punching me in the arm meant to cheer me up?
it works with the knights.
they're thick, aren't they?
I'm a knight.
there you go then.
you gave me this book, do you remember?
it was on your birthday, wasn't it?
or was it when I was made court physician?
have a look inside.
I'm sure there's an inscription.
you're quite right, of course.
my 50th birthday.
here we are.
all done.
wonderful, thank you.
hurry now.
you wouldn't want to keep your King waiting.
really, Alice, I can't imagine how I survived without you.
Ah, Gaius, you have my medicine.
I do, sire.
to my very good health.
father!
I found him this way.
I can't rouse him.
the King's alive. But his pulse is weak.
what's wrong with him? Please, I must examine him.
seal off the King's quarters!
what is that? Hush, Merlin.
well? I'm afraid I cannot yet determine the cause of your father's illness.
he's been poisoned, hasn't he?
I cannot say at this stage.
just look at him. What else could it be?
we must not jump to hasty conclusions.
please watch over him until I return.
I don't think we need more information.
since when were you the expert?
you don't need to be a physician to see what's happened.
Merlin. He's been poisoned and I think we both know who did it.
what exactly are you implying?
it was Alice. It had to be.
she's been helping you with the potions.
she's had every opportunity.
you have no proof of any of this.
how else did he ingest the poison?
there is no other explanation.
of course there is.
come on, Gaius.
I understand why you're protecting her really i do. But in your heart, you must know it's true.
all I know is the King is gravely ill and your place is by Arthur's side.
it doesn't make any sense, his food and wine are tasted.
each and every meal.
it is brought here under armed guard.
no-one can interfere with it in any way.
so it can't be his food and drink.
the only other thing he's had is...
.Gaius's remedy.
Arthur. I think I know what happened.
I think...I know who did this.
what's going on?
the King has been poisoned.
it appears that someone has tampered with his medicine.
but surely you don't think it was me?
don't lie to me, Alice.
please.
Gaius, I...I...
Alice.
you are under arrest for high treason. Take her away.
I had no choice.
it was either her or you, Gaius.
it wasn't your choice to make.
do you admit to using magic? Yes.
admit to poisoning the King? Yes, yes.
but it forced me to do it.
who forced you? The creature, the creature!
you're lying! There's no creature.
you're just trying to save your own skin!
no, no.
please, my father is dying.
if you have a single shred of goodness within you, you will tell me how to cure him.
I don't know.
I don't know!
I'm so sorry.
the manticore...
how is he?
he's fading.
he won't last the day.
Gaius... It's all right, Merlin.
I understand.
you were only trying to save me from harm.
thank you.
but I don't believe Alice wanted this.
I know she didn't.
the poison is from the manticore, the creature that was in Alice's room.
we cannot counteract the manticore's venom.
so what can we do?
we can kill the manticore.
the poison is imbued with its magic.
with the manticore dead, it will lose its potency.
but how do I kill it?
you can't. You don't have the power.
it is a creature of the Old Religion.
but maybe there's another way, if I can remember.
here!
the manticore cannot live in this world long.
its life source is the ancient evil that exists in the spirit world.
so, if we could trap it in this world...
exactly.
if we were to summon the creature, and you kept it at bay long enough, perhaps I can break the box.
the gateway.
if the gateway is destroyed, then the creature's connection with its life source will be destroyed with it.
and the manticore will die.
I believe so.
Gaius, the box is enchanted.
it would need magic to destroy it.
I am aware of that.
do you think you can...
command such magic?
there was a time when I could.
I just hope I haven't forgotten.
are you ready?
what if this doesn't work?
then we're going to have a very angry manticore on our hands.
cum her, ping scinnlce.
Gaius!
ado pas sawolduru. Ado pas sawolduru!
Gaius! Gaius, It's now or never!
Gaius!
not too bad for a has-been.
not too bad yourself.
I am fortunate indeed that you found an antidote, Gaius.
it will take time, my lord, but you will make a full recovery.
what of the woman?
we have her in the cells, sire. She awaits your judgment.
she won't have to wait long. She is sentenced to death.
you will execute her in the morning.
Yes, father.
sire, if I may?
Yes, Gaius?
it seems this woman was in the thrall of some kind of creature.
perhaps, in the light of that, her sentence might be...
she practised magic, Gaius.
there are no circumstances under which that is acceptable.
my judgment stands.
I'm sorry, Alice, there was nothing I could do.
don't.
I knew what my sentence would be.
Uther will never change.
no.
I hoped that I could learn from it.
that I could harness its magic for the good, for healing.
but it was too strong for me.
at least you are rid of it now.
Yes.
it is far better to die free than to live as a slave.
I can only hope that's true.
Gaius...
before I go I want you to know something.
I never forgot you.
since we parted all those years ago, not a day has gone by when I have not thought of you.
I fear I abandoned you, Alice.
no
I left you all alone.
you stayed behind to protect me,
I know that.
you saved my life,
and there is no greater gift that I could have hoped for.
and you have achieved great things here in Camelot whereas I...
Alice. I have disgraced myself.
after everything I've done you would have every right to hate me.
hate you?
I could never hate you.
I have treasured these past days.
I love you, Alice. I love you.
and I always will.
as I will you, Gaius.
I don't want to leave you.
do not be afraid.
please.
something's happened.
perhaps one of the prisoners has escaped.
how is that possible, I wonder?
the dungeons are so secure.
I really couldn't say.
you could have gone with her.
I could have done.
but then who would look after you?
me? I don't need looking after. I can fend for myself.
Ah, well in that case, you won't be wanting any of this then.
well, maybe just a slice.
whatever relationship exists between Arthur and Gwen, you must destroy it.
it is almost as though he has been enchanted.
Uther will never believe that Morgana is responsible.
Arthur!
she has been found guilty.
you can't do this!
if we can't expose the true sorcerer then we must invent one.
well, he's right.
you are the best thing about this dinner.
and this day...
...and this year.
I wish it was simpler.
I wish it was easier.
and I'm sorry.
well, I'm not expecting flowers, but...
...will we call each other?
well...
...Iook, I was kind of...
...hoping for flowers.
I could live here.
I didn't say that to scare you.
I scared you, didn't I?
so will you come and visit me?
you mean inland?
I don't go inland.
we have a lake.
a big lake.
okay. I'll just go back to my work and my son and...
...you'll just forget about me, right?
every day.
I've got your number, sailor.
and you've got mine. So...
Bye.
and then what happened? - Later, later.
the wanderer returns. How are you?
yeah? So, solve your mystery?
there was no mystery.
he lost his wife, Catherine.
she was an artist.
and dead but not forgotten.
right. So that's it, end of story?
basically, yeah. There's no story.
kind of like... Was it me that said that?
so!
Toodle-loo, on your way. That's enough.
any regrets?
zip.
no? Good.
so, what was she like?
she's beautiful and wispy and.....a great artist.
and she's everywhere.
she's in his house.
she's in the shop.
the whole town knew her.
is he still in love with her?
she isn't gone.
that's for you. And that's very interesting.
research. This is Theresa.
it's me.
I know.
sorry, I've been...
I'm finishing the boat.
my boat.
I just wanted to tell you.
how are you?
it's been a quiet few weeks.
I didn't know.....what to say.
I still don't.
need some help?
I was counting on it.
question: Were we just a casual thing or something else?
possibly a beginning?
just answers, no pressure.
just a playboy? Nail those tourist women.
I've only.....cared about two women in my whole life.
Catherine and...?
some city girl.
big mouth.
pushy.
Thanks.
you just called to tell me about the boat?
I miss you.
I miss all of it.
why don't you come see me, Garret?
it's just a visit. It's not a promise.
is that enough?
listen, you think I'm betting on us, but I'm not.
I'm just as scared as you are.
and I miss you too.
okay. When?
when should I come?
yesterday.
you're not coming by boat, are you?
jet Ski? Windsurfer?
so behave yourself.
you got your ticket?
of course I have my ticket.
got my name on all my clothes.
and I got a quarter for a phone call.
you got a gift for that kid of hers?
get one at the airplane gift shop.
don't get into any fights or anything.
there it comes.
right on time, just like your old man.
don't throw your back out.
take your pills.
by my count, there should be 2 beers left in the fridge when I get back.
that's a sorry occupation, counting other people's beers.
if you get Kenny or any tourist kids to score you beer...
...I'll hear about it.
I got two counties covered.
that lady sure got you gut-hooked.
how'd you get to be so mean?
see you in a week.
the hell you say!
not with your plane ticket on the seat here!
good dog.
I think he's here, Mom.
you're kind of nervous.
Really?
I look great though, right?
okay, is what I meant.
you made it.
come in.
I think he's disappointed that you don't have a captain's hat on.
that's what he was expecting. Right?
come on in.
I don't know if it suits a boy your age, but...
it's great.
Thanks.
sweet, Garret.
he's into this mayhem thing.
I think it's a male deal.
garret, thank you.
she hates chocolates.
it's really weird.
true?
Yes, but it was very sweet of you.
excuse me.
thank you. That's what I really wanted.
you got to be beat, no?
I hope this is okay.
this is fine.
I mean, this is perfect.
tomorrow night, Jason will be at a friend's house. So...
meaning what?
shut up.
I know this isn't very romantic. - What?
this is my life.
it's nice.
I just want you to know me.
just the day-to-day, regular me.
you think you know me?
what?
what?
he's not coming.
but I've come so far.
I don't even know.
I'm glad you're here.
I'm glad I'm here too.
we're almost there.
wait. Is that him?
that's him.
Oh, my God. Don't say a word.
Hey, buddy!
what are you doing here?
train's pretty cool.
can I use the computer?
Jason wanted to surprise you.
hope it's okay. - It's fine.
it's only for a minute, then we'll hop back on that train.
he's scared of it, Mom.
I'm not scared of it.
this is where I work.
it was nice meeting you.
well, now I can picture you on the job.
so that's him. That's Ahab?
that's him. He's no Captain Ahab.
smile at him. Be friendly.
friendly people. - I know.
he's smiling at her. That's sweet.
Oh, behave!
you're so negative, Charlie. Don't you want her to be happy?
she'll smell of haddock for the rest of her life.
I don't know what I was expecting.
I mean, I didn't realize.....everybody's close.
Theresa, this came as a big surprise to me...
...but apparently it is the poodle that is the number one dog.
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
Hi, Lina. - Hi, Jason.
Jason is taking Garret into town sailing now.
Really? So soon?
if he doesn't get lost first.
I know there's a lake around here somewhere.
he senses that.
sensitive. If you get into any trouble at all...
...certainly give me... the paper... a call.
you want to steer? - Sure.
you're the captain.
you got to keep us going straight.
straight ahead.
here you go.
how you doing? - Good.
the gang. Hi, Lenny.
Bye, Mom. - Have fun.
say bye to your mom. - See you!
I'm not used to having you here.
it's okay, Garret.
it's nice.....being among your things.
well, is it what you expected?
it's comforting.
you're making me self-conscious.
what are you looking at?
Theresa in her home.
the regular everyday...
wait.
I really.....wanted to make this right.
I just wanted to straighten up my room and light a candle and...
and I need to take a shower.
garret, wait.
that was a goodie. - So scared.
I'm so scared.
that was big.
I'm going to take a shower. Finally.
wait. Just...
you're not going to believe what...
Oh, God. Garret.
where did you get this?
I found it.
what do you mean, you found it?
I found it on the shore.
garret, wait.
it came to me.
you have to trust me.
trust you?
I just had to meet the person that wrote it. I had to meet you.
I was going to tell you before. - How could you find me?
because I tracked all of the messages and there were clues...
all of the messages?
they've all been found and people saw it in the column and they wrote.
I swear to God, I was going to tell you, Garret.
garret, wait.
I got to get out of here.
garret, wait!
why did you do this?
Why?!
were you curious?
it's goddamn research! - No, I'm falling in love with you!
first in the letters and then when I met you!
and I'm sorry! I was afraid!
I was afraid if I told you that I would push you away!
just like I'm doing now.
wait!
no matter what you think of me...
...and no matter what happens now, I want you to know...
...how much I care for you.
and it shouldn't matter..what brought us together, Garret
I sent those letters into the sea to her. Not to you!
not to all your friends at work!
I know.
they all knew about me, didn't they?
all about Catherine?
my life was changed by those three letters.
I didn't want it printed in the paper. - Two letters.
you've got to believe me. - I sent two letters to Catherine.
what?
I have all of the letters. I have all three.
Where's the third letter?
is it in that drawer?
to all the ships at sea.....and all the ports of call.
to my family.....and to all friends and strangers.
this is a message and a prayer.
the message is that my travels taught me a great truth.
I already had what everyone is searching for...
...and few ever find.
the one person in the world.....who I was born to love forever.
a person like me, of the Outer Banks...
...and the blue Atlantic mystery.
a person rich in simple treasures...
...self-made, self-taught.
a harbor where I am forever home.
and no wind or trouble...
...or even a little death can knock down this house.
the prayer is that everyone in the world can know this kind of love...and be healed by it.
if my prayer is heard, then there will be an erasing of all guilt...
...and all regret...
...and an end to all anger.
please, God.
Amen.
I never knew what she wrote.
She.....never came back from that day.
I dried her. I tried to keep her warm.
took her to the hospital.
she never...
she died three days later.
I keep thinking if she hadn't gone out that day...
garret, she knew.
she said it.
"not even a little death can knock down this house." She knew.
I want to.....keep this.
I'm sorry. Would you rather be alone?
has he called?
I left him a message, though.
I said I was sorry.
and I asked him to call.
well, then, he will.
lina, do you remember...
...what I was always complaining about?
all those times you let me cry on your shoulder about David.
remember?
honesty. Trust.
I was so scared.
I don't...
I was falling in love with Garret and I...
half of my mind was saying, "Tell him..."
...and the other half was saying...
..."Just wait. He's not going to understand."
wait till the right moment.
just wait till you have the right words. You know?
and I blew it. I just...killed it by being what I hate:
a liar.
you're not a liar.
but to him I am.
and I don't think he's ever going to be able to trust me now.
don't you understand we all have our own little lies...
...and our little unspoken truths?
and you just have to have a little faith that he'll understand that.
I don't know.
I don't know if he can.
I saw his pain. He was holding her letter and he was reading it.
and there was just.....so much pain and...
he has so much love for her, you know?
I don't know.
you said if I was ever thinking about writing a piece for the paper...
no kidding.
is he in here?
no.
other stories.
good stories.
it's about time.
people get hurt, they shut down.
till the pain goes away?
I don't know.
maybe you just learn to take it in like everything else.
kind of like a few pieces of cork in a great glass of wine.
you don't want to miss the wine.
is that in here?
the cork in the wine thing?
no.
good. I hate it.
it may be that most of us write our own life story...
...making it up as we go along.
but others seem to have lives that are already shaped and planned...
...inescapable...
...perfect as a circle.
open it.
slowly.
this is exciting. - It is.
front page of the section! Great!
Thanks, bud.
can I cut it out?
sure.
is this okay? - That is great.
that's perfect. Thank you.
here's your mail, ma'am.
thank you.
sure.
nice.
I love what you've done here.
very minimalist. - Very nice of you to stop by, sir.
Yes, well, I come bearing a gift for your new phone booth office.
can I hang it? - That is so sweet.
I know.
you'll never guess who it is.
you seem happy.
is anything all right?
Ahab.
may I?
if you decide to go do something wild and ridiculous...
...it'll only prove one thing.
and what's that?
he's one lucky old son of the sea.
that's a Charlie Toschi quote.
you know, somebody's going to think you're drying your skivvies up there.
you look nice.
Yeah, well, it hurts.
she's beautiful, Garret.
Thanks, Marta.
go get them!
nice job, Garret.
to Catherine.
to Catherine.
wish to God...
wish to God she was here today.
every day.
my dad said you were there.
wish I'd have known.
a surprise. Dumb idea.
no, it's...
it's great to see you.
glad you came. - Me too.
I saw the boat. It's beautiful.
it's great.
I'm happy for you.
you want to come inside?
I'm sorry.
what I said must've hurt you.
I just heard what you couldn't tell me.
or maybe what I couldn't hear.
and I understand now.
I think it's so beautiful the way you love her.
no, you don't have to say anything.
it's what made me want to find you.
then stay with me.
come inside.
just stay as long as you want.
I thought about it. I thought about a lot of things sitting out here.
and I can't stay.
Why?
because if you can, you'll come to me...
...when it's right. And if it's not right, it's okay.
because I wouldn't.....regret one minute.
not one.
Bye.
I don't want to lose you.
then don't.
why do you always sit in the same place?
what the hell you care where I sit?
I'm curious. You started sitting here 10, 11 years ago.
for chris sake!
you used to sit over there.
get the boy a cup of coffee.
you look like hell.
I'm okay.
catch up to her?
you let her go.
I don't want to talk about it.
listen, I was... - Go away.
she made up her mind.
the hell you want? - Persistence.
get crazy. Go nuts. A fight, for chrissake.
you spent one afternoon with her.
you don't even know who she is.
What's...?
Chicago.
three minutes. Get on the phone.
it's your last chance.
of course she walked away.
she ain't stupid.
think she wants to try to come between you and...
I don't have it all figured out. - Who the hell does?
think it's easy for me to see another woman in your house?
well, it ain't easy.
I'll tell you one thing...
...I'd give a million bucks to see you grab her...
...and figure it out as you go along.
just drop it!
drop it? - Yeah. Drop it!
just...
...forget about it.
I can't!
I can't forget about it.
why the hell not?
because you're my boy.
it's not your business. - What?
I said it's not your business!
turn around.
turn around.
make a fist.
make it!
now you hit me!
hit me in the face, you son of a bitch.
not my business?
my son is not my business?
what the hell else have I got.....that's close to me?
who else ever.....stuck up for me?
think I don't know your pain? I do.
some of it I put there. Think I can forget that?
when she went to New York, you could've gone with her...
...and here I was, sick, drunk, flat on my ass...
...bringing you down.
maybe the two of you, it could've been different somehow.
I didn't stay for you.
this is who I am.
this place. This is where I belong.
she came back because she found out she belonged here too.
she chose for herself.
God, I loved her for that.
so did I.
now you choose. Choose...
...between yesterday and tomorrow. Pick one.
stick with it.
and I will shut up.....and leave you alone.
so you'll always know where you are...
...and where home is.
love, Theresa.
you heading for blue water?
Yes, sir.
well, you know what you're doing.
got it all figured out.
Hey, bud.
time to get up.
another day.
they call him the Mayor of 43rd.
he's so sweet. He knows everyone. Helps people.
the point is, it's his 70th birthday.
Theresa, there's a phone call for you.
can you take a message?
it's urgent.
excuse me.
you better take it in my office.
is it Jase?
Hey, girl.
I better.....get this said while I can still talk.
there was a boat, Theresa, offshore in trouble.
a family, there was three of them.
garret tried...
well, he tried to help, and...
it's bad. He went down.
what do you mean?
he went in after them.
he got two of them. But he went down, Theresa.
I am so sorry.
that's all I got now.
Bye.
Oh, my God.
hard times.
come on in.
I found it on the boat.
it was in his slicker.
dear Catherine:
my life began when I found you...
...and I thought it had ended when I failed to save you.
I thought that hanging on to your memory was keeping us both alive.
but I was wrong.
a woman named Theresa showed me that...
...if I was brave enough to open my heart...
...I could love again, no matter how terrible my grief.
she made me realize I was only half-alive.
it scared me and it hurt.
I didn 't know how much I needed her till the night she flew away.
when that airplane took off, I felt something inside me tear away.
and I knew.
I should have stopped her.
I should've followed her home.
and now tomorrow, I'm going to sail to the windy point...
...and I'm going to say goodbye to you.
then I'm going to go to this woman...
...and see if I can win her heart.
if I can, I know you'll bless me.
and bless us all.
if I can 't...
...then I'm still blessed because I've had the privilege of loving.....twice in my life.
she gave me that.
and if I tell you I love her as much as I loved you...
...then you'll know the whole story.
rest in peace, my love.
if some lives form a perfect circle...
...Others take shape in ways we cannot predict or always understand.
loss has been a part of my journey.
but it has also shown me what is precious.
so has a love for which I can only be grateful.
sir... - Huh?
that's beautiful, but it belongs with the...
uh, cocktails and the hors d'oeuvres.
Yes! - Yes.
thank you. - You're welcome.
it's gonna rain.
and so much wind.
which is why we have a tent, honey.
trust me, when you look back on this day, the one thing u won't remember is the weather
but you probably will remember the piece - of tissue stuck to your father. - What? Oh, God.
this is why you need to get married.
so you don't leave the house with toilet paper on your face.
whoa, whoa, Emily.
I'm fine.
sweetie, if you don't want to do this...
I'm fine,
I'm fine. It's just nerves, that's all.
Vivaldi.
that's our cue.
zander looks so handsome.
someone get some water, please! - Give her some room!
are you okay?
Oh, God, is everybody staring at me?
I gave them all Sudoku puzzles. They'll be busy for a while.
Oh, goodness.
want to see if you can try to get up?
Yes, please. - All right.
incoming in eight.
anything good?
hunky high school reunion guy.
details, Dr. Warren. Serve them up.
Hey.
it started with a cup of coffee, turned into a weekend.
Wow.
I haven't seen a girl blush like that since seventh grade.
sounds like my kind of weekend.
this freak weather phenomenon, known as a microburst, is short-lasting, isolated, but can pack winds of over 100 miles per hour.
the same phenomenon struck the Dallas Cowboys' training camp early last year.
half dozen incoming red-bands four minutes out. Possible crush injuries, lacerations from debris scatter.
attention, Alpha Team, incoming, four minutes.
Dr. Proctor...
can I get your autograph on these discharge orders.
sure.
who should I make it out to?
Hey, so, speaking of microbursts, what's Nurse Kathy doing here?
Chatty's on loan from Bravo team until Tuck gets back from search and rescue training.
I swear that woman's like a bad case of toxemia.
always stirring it up.
can't believe she started that pool.
Pool...?
what?
saved by the page.
there's a pool taking bets on when you and I are gonna, you know, play doctor.
well, that's what I call a sucker's bet.
wait.
where would they get such an idea, Chris?
uh, don't look at me.
remember last week, u gave me a ride to work?
I guess somebody figured...
not the only ride I gave you? - Yeah.
Ugh. - Eva...
you're in the ambulance bay. Chris, stand by for the second wave.
got it. - Got it.
anyway, you know what they say about gossip.
underneath, there's usually a kernel of truth.
you can't handle the truth.
Emily Palmer, 23-year-old bride-to-be.
blunt head trauma and deep forehead lac, altered with GCS of 4-6-4.
Where's my family? Zander?
Oh, my God, what's happening?
I'm Dr. Zambrano.
do you remember what happened?
we were at this wedding, and the tent... collapsed.
all right, all right. - Oh, my God.
try and relax, we're gonna take good care of u.
okay. On my count. Ready?
one...
two, three.
get me a second large-bore I. V. and a liter of normal saline.
bp, blood count every 15 minutes.
all right, Emily. It's okay.
can you tell me where it hurts?
my... M-My head is... pounding.
you have a deep laceration.
grab me a six-oh proline on a large needle. - No, not on my-my forehead...it really hurts.
hurts in the back.
penlight.
Gina, call CT and have them bump whomever's next.
we may have a brain bleed.
pulse is strong.
she just fainted.
well, at least now she won't have to see this.
avert your eyes, ladies.
Hey!
Hey, I've got incoming!
this is your incoming.
what, are you catering today's trauma?
Fortunato Delgado, 39-year-old male with penetrating chest and abdominal injuries.
the guy couldn't fit in the ambulance.
is he 800 pounds?
not exactly.
because of the pole into through shoulder and out through his lower flank.
hello.
hello.
why didn't they just cut the pole down in the field?
guess they wanted to save time at the scene, considering the severity of the injury.
can you prep the O. R?
have at least eight units of O-neg ready.
primary survey...
airway clear.
I was... just finished arranging the ice sculptures, when the wind comes out of nowhere.
breathing's shallow but with good air movement.
I heard screaming.
I w-went to help, and suddenly, something fell from the sky, and knocked me to the ground.
EKG now, and have a crash cart standing by.
pulse is strong, BP 120/80.
that's good? That's very good.
pupils equal and reactive. GCS, 15.
perfect.
I'm perfect?
that will come as a big surprise to my wife.
um, e-excuse us. I'm Dr. Proctor. This is Dr. Warren.
Fortunato Delgado.
I would offer you a hand, but under the circumstances...
okay, Fortunato, on a scale of one to ten, how much pain are you in?
maybe one and a half.
all right, what do we got?
49-year-old male.
hypotensive, had to be extricated from the collapsed wedding tent; father of the bride.
okay, let's get him into Trauma 3...over here.
wait, wait, wait...I'm Edie Palmer. I'm his wife, and I'd like to know where you're taking him and what tests are being run.
ma'am, I'm Dr. Deleo, and I won't know anything until I've examined him.
okay, well, my-my-my daughter's here somewhere, and so I-I need to know what's going on. I have a few questions...
will you just hold on! Please! - Okay, Mrs. Palmer, Mrs. Palmer,
I understand you have had a rough day.
the best way for you to help your husband is to wait in the waiting room.
you're really very young.
how... How old are you?
I'm old enough to know that we're wasting precious time. Please.
okay.
I promise you I'll take good care of him, all right?
please, help Mrs. Palmer with any of her questions.
a-and her wrist.
all this on my wedding day.
Where's my family?
Where's Zan?
I'm going to find out for you as soon as I can, okay?
she has a hemotympanum and a battle sign.
hemo what?
what-what does that mean?
you have blood behind your eardrum.
what does that mean?
well, we have to do a scan and see what's going on inside your head.
trust me, no one wants to see what's going on in there.
you fainted at the ceremony.
Yeah.
do you have any underlying conditions？
diabetes, heart problems...
pregnancy?
no, no, nothing like...
nothing like that. Just, uh...
nerves, that's all.
penlight.
Emily, you wouldn't happen to have a cold.
no, I just have this weird stuff coming out of my nose.
let me see.
okay, let's do a CBC and a CNP.
and page me when you get the scans back.
no pain...how is it possible? He's impaled by a six-ft pole.
his body's in shock.
you get a range of endorphin which blocks the nerve impulses.
you're more likely to feel pain from a splint than our friend Fortunato does right now.
that's not to say, of course, that that, uh, pole isn't passing through a major organ or two.
he's not gonna fit in a CT.
Yeah, I know.
we still need a map before we go on the road trip.
there's that new laser in the lab. We could use that to cut down the pole.
Yeah, and kill him for sure.
extreme heat on galvanized steel releases toxic fumes...
something I discovered in Kuwait.
the hard way, unfortunately.
no, we need a specialist.
get Mike.
Mike from Thoracic?
have you seen Mike?
Ooh, from Thoracic? - Wiznewski.
try the ladies room.
Thanks.
you in here?
Yeah.
I need you.
me?
what have we got here?
zander Lewis, 24-year-old male hit by flying debris.
diffuse abdominal pain, trauma to lower left extremity. BP 100/70.
all right, Zander. I'm Dr. Zambrano.
I'm going to need you to hold still, so I can take a look at your leg.
Where's Emily? - She's here.
she's in good hands.
patella dislocation.
ten out of ten on the pain scale.
want five of morphine?
no, it'll take too long. I'm just going to have to pop the knee back in.
so, Zander, could you, uh, tell me what you do for a living?
musician.
this hurts like hell.
and how'd you meet Emily?
uh, she's cello, I'm percuss... Please just give me something!
all right, this will kill the pain in about three seconds.
okay.
ready? Squeeze.
one... two...
all right, we got a large liver laceration...
...and blood pool in the abdominal cavity.
start two units of O-neg on the rapid infuser
he's going to need surgery.
I'm gaining a son. Happiest day of my...
is this your wedding toast?
my only... copy.
I'll take good care of it, all right, sir?
sorry about that, but it would've taken another 10 minutes for the pain meds to kick in
thank you.
all right, so, let's see what else is going on with you.
roll him.
can you tell me what happened?
it was crazy.
it was like a 747 just crashed on top of us.
one minute, I had Emily in my arms, and then...then she was gone.
it's the last thing I remember.
does that hurt? - Yeah.
I got nailed by some flying objects. It was, like, a chair or the minister, or something hit me in the back
listen... Emily...
when can I see her?
as soon as we take care of you.
okay? - Okay.
call for an abdominal CT.
so, you're a plumber?
local 315. Card-carrying member.
you are worried.
me? - Uh-huh.
no.
she's just making sure your blood pressure remains stable while Mike cuts the pole.
don't worry...
I've always been a very lucky man.
I had an uncle who was lucky.
he once won 10, 000 bucks in the lottery.
but then he went to jail for tax evasion, so.
okay.
there! I think that's it.
okay. There it is. - Got it.
I had scarlet fever when I was two.
the doctors told my mother I would not make it.
yet, here I am.
they also said I would never have babies.
um, the sperm? Bad swimmers.
today, I have four children.
very lucky.
Hey, I'm, uh, heading up to O. R.
to take care of father of the bride's liver lac.
okay.
did he just call himself lucky?
well, he is alive.
pressure's holding.
holy crap.
it-it's bleeding, right?
just a little.
apply pressure, secure the pipe with Kerlix.
distal carotid injury?
no, no, it's from a vein, not an artery.
the blood is darker and it's oozing; it's not pumping.
Oozing? Is that good?
well, let's just say the other is worse.
carotid, you die, right?
it's not the carotid.
place some sutures to stop the bleeding, then get him to CT.
page me when you got some images.
give me a four-oh nylon and a PS3 needle.
I hate needles.
yeah? Me, too.
so, Zan's okay?
he's conscious, alert, sense of humor intact.
he's got some abdominal injuries and we won't know the full extent until we get his scans back.
what about me?
your CT showed a basilar skull fracture, which explains that slow drip from your nose.
it's actually cerebral spinal fluid.
so my brain sprung a leak?
I know it sounds scary, but 70% of skull fractures heal by themselves
in the meantime, we're going to monitor you closely and give you something to slow that drip.
what if it doesn't heal?
well, as they say in med school, don't put the crash cart before the horse.
well, I got a groom with a spleen injury and a blushing bride with a skull fracture.
how's your impalement case?
surprisingly lucid.
ct just paged me. His scans are back.
is that "Hunky Reunion Guy"?
C told me you had quite the weekend.
what?
I just feel funny talking to you about personal nonsense.
next to Proctor, you're the big cheese around here, so...
Oh, wait, so you can talk to Chris and not me?
uh, he stopped developing emotionally in, like, the ninth grade.
well, apparently, so did Hunky Reunion Guy, 'cause I haven't heard from him all day.
well, the day's not over.
he usually shoots a response back in 30 seconds. It's our thing.
sorry.
exactly what I didn't want to do... blather.
Serena, don't apologize for having a personal life.
it's what people are supposed to do.
it's just...
you would never get stupid like this.
over a guy.
and why would I never?
Oh, it's a compliment.
you-you're not distracted by relationships.
you're a total pro, Eva.
Mrs. Palmer's out there demanding updates about her husband and her daughter every five minutes.
she still wants to know how old you are.
Yeah, well, Admin will take care of her.
we gotta get Palmer up to surgery to repair his liver.
so, you ask me to heli-ski a fresh pack or cave dive at 100 feet?
I'm good.
but talk an hysterical wife down?
forget it. I'm calling in the cavalry.
bp's dropping.
a major edema? What the...
he's going into shock.
Hey, it is Dr. Deleo. We're coming to ICU.
I need point-three cc's of epi standing by.
throat's clong
he's gonna code.
Hey, come on! Henry!
Hey, stay with me. Come on, Henry!
point-three cc's epi.
breathing's returning to normal.
what the hell did we give this guy that sent him intonaphylactic shock?
Henry doesn't have any allergies?
uh, antibiotics? Food?
latex? - No.
dad's never been allergic to anything.
what about pain medications? Have any adverse reactions?
no, no.
ten years ago, he was in a car accident.
they gave him all sorts of painkiller.
he never had any problems.
well, we'll keep looking.
Dr. Deleo, I'm...
I'm very sorry if I was rude earlier.
you weren't rude. You were conceded.
wait, the car accident.
did Mr. Palmer have any blood transfusions?
I-think so, yeah.
it's the blood.
I need a little more information than that.
father of the bride. He's having a hemolytic transfusioreaction.
his body's rejecting the nor blood.
multiple prior transfusions.
causing him to develop antibodies to his own blood type.
and here's the kicker.
he's AB-neg.
that's, like, three percent of the population.
Yeah. Blood bank's testing samples now, but so far, he's been allergic to everything.
so we need to find not just an AB sample, but one that he doesn't react to.
that's like finding a needle in a millionaystacks.
okay, so we'll, ...
put out an SOS to every blood bank within a hundred-mile radius, and
I'll get Zambrano to test the relatives.
you're going to have to go at the liver without any blood on deck.
operate without blood?
he could crap out on the table.
wait for blood, he could crap out within the hour.
can't tell what organ it's hit.
or the extent of the damage.
but we do know one thing.
that pole is about a 16th of an inch from his heart.
Hey.
how are my pictures?
my wife always says that I'm photogenic.
but I think she means on the outside.
I'm afraid the, uh...scans are inconclusive.
so we won't know exactly what's going on until we get you into surgery.
the pipe is...
well, it's very close to your heart, Fortunato.
but the good news is you're remarkably stable.
lucky.
I told you.
Yeah.
lucky.
your dad's blood has developed antibodies to multiple minor blood antigens.
in plain English, he's allergic to most of our blood supply.
how is that possible?
AB-neg is very rare.
and he's rejected all the AB we have on hand.
there must be something we can do.
we-we are. We're flying in samples from hospitals all over Florida, but our best chance of a match is from a blood relative.
we've got a bunch of relatives out in the waiting room.
we've got Uncle Joe, Aunt Phyllis...
but what about me?
sweetie, you're not well enough.
you're not the doctor, Mom.
um, actually, she is well enough.
what about her skull fracture?
the CSF leakage has slowed, and she is the most likely match.
mom, I'm doing this for Dad.
I'll go organize the relatives.
I-I need to see Zan.
I know.
tomorrow, when you both are stable.
Emily, Zan has a pretty bad spleen injury, and you...
Yeah, I know, I'm, uh, I'm brain-leak girl.
it's been a rough day for you and your mom.
squeeze.
she didn't want me to get married...
my mother.
dad's always been so supportive, but she said we were too young...
just starting out in our career... What's the hurry
I'm 23 years old.
exactly the same age she was when she got married.
must be hard getting married when you know your mother doesn't approve.
understatement of the year.
Zan, you should not be up and around.
everything okay over here?
I want to see my wife...
Almost-wife.
he doesn't have permission to be out of the ICU.
we're ten feet and two minutes away from "I do."
haven't you heard the groom's not supposed to see the bride in her hospital gown?
tradition has to be respected.
I just want to talk to her.
you know how frustrating it is.
U just want to talk to somebody and you can't
I do.
but you have got a grade-two spleen injury.
you keep moving around, it turns into a full rupture, which turns into emergency surgery to save your life.
you're in a critical place, Zan.
will you at least deliver a note?
can you hold that? Whoo!
Uh-oh, two of us alone in an elevator?
tongues will wag.
don't go there.
well, maybe people sense that, underneath it all, there's heat between us.
maybe you're just having hot flashes.
see? Now you're flirting.
you're flirting. I'm riding in an elevator.
the two are not mutually exclusive.
okay, so what would it look like if I weren't flirting?
to the untrained eye, pretty much the same.
so if I stand here staring blankly into space?
flirting.
what's your time frame on the dad's liver surgery?
planning on being in and out in 30 minutes, tops.
anesthesiologist is in with him right now.
okay, as soon as you're done, I'm gonna need some extra hands on Fortunato.
Oh, you're a lucky guy.
a guy's standing in line at the bank, and this robber comes in and shoots him in the arm.
is he lucky or unlucky?
uh, he's unlucky. He's in the wrong place at the wrong time.
or lucky...
it could have been the guy next to him.
got shot in the head.
anything else I can help you with, Dr. Deleo?
Yeah, uh, set up, uh, an Ultracision scalpel and find me someone who can explain to me what the hell Proctor's talking about?
okay.
everything okay?
tell me how this will go, friend.
well, we're doing a laparotomy, which means we open up your abdomen and slide the pole out inch by inch, fix any damage to the vital organs along the way.
if all things go well, we won't have to open up your chest.
piece of cake, right?
Dr. Proctor...
...what if my luck has run out?
don't worry.
I'm lucky, too.
just finished the dad's liver resect, but he still needs ten to 12 units of blood.
well, samples from Lauderdale and Boca were non-matches.
sarasota and Tampa should be here within the hour.
and I just got Emily's blood work back.
Wow.
wow what? Is she a match?
uh, no.
and based on her blood type...
she's not his daughter.
Hi.
is there any news?
there's no matches yet, Mrs. Palmer.
we're still waiting on Tampa and Sarasota.
and, uh, Emily wasn't a match.
Yeah, in the future, for medical reasons, u might want to mention that Emily's adopted.
Emily's not adopted.
when Henry and I first were married, we hit a bad patch.
you don't need to tell us this, - Mrs. Palmer. - I do, please.
we tried to have children, it didn't happen.
and Henry's company sent him overseas. And I was alone.
Henry and I made peace with it.
and he has been such a wonderful father and husband.
um...
you don't need to tell her this, do you?
no, it's not our place.
but you should know her medical history.
we got a tent because we planned for the rain
and then...
the rool just got blown off everything.
it's Emily.
what happened?
came down to deliver a note from her fianc. Heart rate suddenly crashed.
even after a meg of atropine and pacer pads, she's not responding.
pressure's only 60 palp. - Pulse is down to 34.
she's crashing.
see any place to central line?
I'm gonna float a pacemaker directly into her heart.
question is what the hell sent this girl's heart rate into the 30s?
Cushing's reflex?
she does have a skull fracture.
her brain CT showed no increase in pressure.
jugular's not showing. I can't find the vein.
she's close to arrest. We're losing her.
easy. Watch for it on the monitor.
there's the vein. You're there.
I'm in.
here we go.
I'm feeding the pacemaker wire right down the central line.
pacemaker's in.
if this works, it'll stabilize her heart right away.
okay, punch it.
we got T-waves.
heart rate's up to 69.
all right, follow up on her toxic screen results and talk to her fiancé.
maybe he knows if she took something.
we better figure this out fast or this girl's not gonna make it to "I do."
have you noticed anything going on with Emily recently?
heart palpitations, blood sugar crashes?
nothing, no.
except, you know, I mean, all this wedding stuff's been making her pretty anxious.
that and mother issues.
her toxic screen came back negative.
does Emily take any medications or supplements?
no. - Anything that her mother might not know about?
no, I mean, she doesn't even take anything before performances.
performances?
Yeah, she's a, she's a musician.
what kind of musician?
she plays cello in the Miami Phil. Why?
I'll be right back.
page Dr. Zambrano.
tell her to meet me in Emily Palmer's room.
I think she took beta-blockers.
I read about this in med school.
30% of classical musicians take them for performance anxiety.
I need a glucagon bolus... ten megs.
Emily, can you hear me?
did you take beta-blockers today?
ten megs of glucagon going in.
turn the pacer off. - Really?
we can always turn it back on again.
it's the only way to know if you found our magic bullet.
her numbers are going to drop, but if she double-dosed on beta-blockers, glucagon's the antidote.
should only take a minute to work.
wait...
just wait.
heart rate's at 65...
it's working.
here comes the bride.
you know, Mike, for a plumber, you're a hell of surgeon.
this is much more interesting than rooting out a sink.
all right, I need an explanation.
that's Mike the plumber.
Yeah, a little more of an explanation.
Mike here is gonna sand away the jagged edges and burrs to prevent the pole from tearing organs as we pull it from the chest.
Oh, so it's just another day at the office.
Yeah.
ileum is perforated.
see it.
there's no need explaining. The one remaining is somebody I adore. I'm looking over a four-leaf clover. That I overlooked before.
how many beta-blockers did you take today?
I-I-I only take them before a performance. It calms me down.
well, the problem is they actually lower the heart rate.
you almost calmed yourself to death.
I took one.
it wasn't working so well, so I took another.
which explains why u fainted at the ceremony.
but a double dose?
we pretend our parents' approval doesn't matter, but...
how do you walk down the aisle with a smile, knowing your mom is biting her tongue?
I...
I started second-guessing myself.
you panicked.
big-time.
Hey.
Zan sent this down for you.
what do you say we go somewhere super-boring for the honeymoon?
careful...
kidney.
on it.
take it slow.
pole's out.
that looks like all of it.
damage seems to have been confined to the lower abdomen.
vitals holding steady.
abdominal wall muscle looks good.
so let's treat the pipe entry-and-exit wounds to prevent infection, and then...
we're good to close.
chest tube is filling with blood.
bp's down, 50/30. - Something up in his chest must have torn when we pulled the pole out.
okay, people, prep for a crash thoracotomy here.
we're going to have to crack open his chest.
let's hope he's still lucky.
I... I can't see what's bleeding.
whole cavity's filled with blood.
more suction.
there.
look.
the inferior branch of the pulmonary artery on the lower lobe is severely torn.
satinsky clamp.
clamp it and remove the lobe.
bleeding's slowing down.
tying off the artery.
you holding up?
it's been three hours, I can still feel my toes, so, that's good, right?
Mrs. Palmer?
I have some good news.
blood for your husband just arrived from Tampa.
the lab's checking it now.
and Emily's skull fracture is resolving nicely.
thank you.
she took those blockers.
beta-blockers.
because of me, yes?
I really screwed up, didn't I?
what kind of mother am I?
well, the kind who cares deeply about her daughter's future.
I just wanted things to be better, easier for her than they were for me.
how do I know that Zan will be there for her when things get rough?
well, you know when Zan found out about Henry, he asked to give blood.
even though he was told he was too ill, and almost certainly not a match, he insisted
he somehow snuck down to hematology. Yeah.
the only way to get him back up to his room was to let him give blood.
he really did all that?
Zander's a good man.
mom. - I'm sorry that I let my fears get into your head.
okay.
now there's something else I need to tell you.
okay.
this is... not easy.
after the day we've had today, I'm pretty sure we can get through just about anything.
we got it.
blood from Tampa's a match.
Oh, good.
let's go.
injured lobe is out.
bleeding has stopped.
ladies and gentlemen, we are, I think, finally good to close.
poor guy's going to need months of rehab.
I'm looking over...
a four-leaf clover...
that I overlooked before.
what are you talking about?
look behind the lung.
what?
he's got an AVM.
you gotta be kidding me.
what's this?
in this vial is what is known as an arteriovenous malformation...
AVM.
one of the blood vessels in your lungs had a congenital weakness, and it was like a time bomb
waiting to blow.
so this would've...
killed me.
could've been tomorrow.
could've been five years from tomorrow.
Yeah, but had there been no microburst, there would've been no tent pole, no V-fib.
we wouldn't have had to crack your chest, and we wouldn't have found this.
you know what that means?
what?
you are a very lucky man.
Hey, you gotta help me out here.
after the day that this guy's had, are you just going along for the ride here, or do you really believe lucky?
a 45-year-old male has a heart attack, right?
and he...
he dies on the table.
but he's brought back.
now, uh, is he unlucky 'cause he lost a year of his life in recovery, or is he lucky 'cause he had the rare opportunity to sort out what's important to him.
you.
to have and to hold, for better or worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish from this day forward, until death do us part.
you may kiss the bride.
I love you.
seems we have a match.
Yeah. We do.
I'll have what she's having.
Hey, nice get on those beta-blockers.
I guess your personal life isn't distracting you from work after all.
you know, for the record...
there was a guy in med school who I was quite stupid over.
he proposed.
I wavered.
now he's just the one that got away.
good ones are hard to find.
true that.
so, any news from Hunky Reunion Guy?
calling him a pig would be an insult to pigs, who are clean and loyal.
and text you back right away.
what's another word for jerkface?
are u sure you should be drinking like that?
Ugh. - You haven't slept in a couple days.
I'm Cuban. Enough said.
scotch.
the good stuff.
so there was a guy in med school, huh?
the onion peels slowly.
I'll wait.
it'll just make you cry.
God, how many phones does a girl need?
Oh, my God, I have his phone.
that's why he didn't text me back. I have Hunky Reunion Guy's phone.
maybe "jerkface" was a little strong.
Oh, my God.
delete.
where you going?
come on, you don't want to feed the gossip troll, do you?
I don't know.
you know, some people say underneath gossip there's a kernel of truth.
I will definitely drink to that.
coffee?
I have to be honest.
I'm starting to tire of the dry chicken dinners.
every year I find myself in the same stuffy room, sitting on the same uncomfortable chair, being asked to open my checkbook yet again.
now, I support this facility, I really do, but I have to ask, Dr. Proctor:
when can we expect MT1 to stand on its own two feet.
it's a good question...
ms. Davis. Ms. Kimberly Davis.
uh, Ms. Davis. Um...
I'm sure I'd be, uh, more articulate if I were doing this in a surgical mask, but, um,
Dr. Willis here insisted that bringing potential donors into the operating room would be both unhygienic and...
more than a little odd.
so, um...
why have a trauma-only facility when it costs so much, uh, to keep open and, um, uses... so many resources?
what's the first thought that comes into your mind when you drive by an accident?
most people think, um...
what happened?
in the past tense.
whoa, hey!
watch it!
in their minds, the accident's already over.
those of us who work in trauma...
...we see the...
flashing lights of the ambulance, and we think, "What's happening?"
in the present.
cause for us, it's only just the beginning.
it's like a chain reaction has been set in motion.
one...
unexpected, tragic event leading on to another then another...
that's not good.
...then another.
the casualties of which end up...
rolling through our doors.
whoa, hey!
so, yesterday morning we ended up with...
three trauma cases:
a bicyclist who was hit by an automobile...
...the passenger in that automobile, and, most surprisingly of all, a homeless man who just happened to step on a nail.
now I've got a question for you all.
which of the patients...
didn't survive to the end of our shift?
good morning, Dr. Zambrano.
here, here, here. Let me.
having a day?
raging migraine.
didn't get to go to the Goodwill, my car stalled on an off-ramp
and what does it say about me that I can't open a childproof cap?
you know, we got incoming in five.
auto versus bike versus auto.
you have a run-in with Juan Valdez?
Yeah. Did I mention I spilled a macchiato in front of the very tasty waiter at my diner?
Mucho, mucho embarazada.
uh, "embarazada" is "pregnant," Chris. But yes, embarazado.
embarrassing.
Hey, you two get your flu shots yet?
Cathy's down. Churny called in sick with a fever.
in that case, looks like I'm getting a flu shot.
because to become sick and yurk all over the place would be very embarazado.
Hey, Dr. Zambrano, did you, uh, lose something?
Oh, God, no.
Oh, it must have fallen off.
it's my mother's earring. It's the only thing of hers I still have.
it must have fallen off at the diner.
I-I-I got to go. I got to go change.
no, no. You go get on incoming. I'll take care of Goodwill you make a mental list of everywhere the earring might have fallen off.
I love you.
you know that, right? - Yes.
I-I've left you three messages, Matt.
which I ignored, because you used the word "fund-raiser"
which is something I promised I wouldn't do when I took the job.
but this is sort of an emergency.
no. That is an emergency.
one I actually need to attend to.
Eric Schwartz, 25. Auto versus ped with severe head injury.
awake but altered. BP: 180/90.
heart rate: 130. - Three fingers.
three fingers. - How you doing, Eric?
was he riding without a helmet? - Came off when he flipped his bike.
he took a direct impact. He hasn't stopped answering how many fingers am I holding up since I asked him on the scene.
okay, on my count-- one, two, three.
one, two, three. One, two, three.
he's perseverating.
Eric... - One, two, three.
one, two, three.
your brain is rebooting itself over and over again. We'll sort that out as soon as we can.
someone page Neurosurge, have mannitol standing by.
is there anybody we can contact, a family member?
no Mom. Not Mom.
Br-brother Joey.
not Mom.
Joey. Got it, Eric.
do you have his cell phone, Kleebus?
with his stuff. I'll find a Joey.
Agniska Vivika, mid-20's, restrained passenger in an MVA with a crush injury to the abdomen and pelvis, right leg fracture and a deep arm laceration.
given five of morphine.
Agniska?
doesn't speak English.
Russian?
I don't know, a lot of consonants-- maybe Czech?
passport says she's Polish.
arm bleed stopped with pressure, but it's definitely gonna have to be explored by Vascular in the O. R.
also, a lot of bruising on the abdomen.
Agniska, we're gonna get you a translator as soon as we can, okay?
she has diffuse guarding.
Yeah, pelvis is really unstable. It's definitely gonna need surgery.
let's get another five of morphine.
and a call to Admin. For a trans...
for a translator.
you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine.
and the flu strikes again, huh?
I'm so sorry.
don't worry, just...
just go home, okay?
tuck will get someone to cover.
and I'll start the ultrasound while you go and clean up.
no, I'll... - No, no, I got it.
just, uh, go.
go.
this day couldn't get worse.
Oh, sir.
you can't be in here.
your foot.
please...
I don't want to use this.
that makes two of us.
where was I?
there was a gun in Trauma?
don't you people have security?
so this is how the foot injury became a trauma case?
are you taking notes?
Oh, absolutely. I'm gonna figure out who died.
pretty sure it's the homeless guy.
always the guy you least expect.
Yes, gun. Yes, in Trauma.
Yes, security, but not enough.
and even if we had run the homeless guy through a metal detector, it wouldn't have found the weapon.
why not?
sorry. I don't mean to scare you.
well, it'd help if you put the gun down.
I can't do that. - Okay.
could I at least take a look at your foot?
stay back.
I'm just trying to help.
that's what they said at the other building.
you mean the ER?
they said that they were going to fix my foot then I saw the cameras, they were watching me!
are there cameras in here, too?
er wants us to keep an eye out for a foot laceration who skipped out.
think I found him.
Yup. Think so.
stay back.
Hey, hey, why don't you take it easy.
what do u say we put the gun down before someone ends up needing to go to a trauma hospital? See, that's why I didn't want to come back here.
what do you mean, back here?
you been here before?
Hey, I know you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You were there when they did this to me.
it's a water gun.
are you okay? You all right? - Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Go, go.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, sorry, sorry. Hey, someone stop that guy!
Hey!
someone call security!
I went through Eric's cell.
I couldn't find a number for the brother, Joey, but I found one for his mother, Leslie.
Thanks, Kleebus.
Mrs. Schwartz?
I'm Dr. Warren.
you're a doctor?
Yes, a first year resident.
Eric's in critical condition.
he was injured on his bike.
Oh, God!
but his vitals are stable and his head CT scan shows no bleeding.
now, he does have significant brain swelling, so we're prepping him for surgery to relieve that pressure.
our chief, Dr. Proctor, is in surgery with Eric.
I'm going to scrub in, and as soon as we have any update, I'll let you know.
does she know anything about Eric?
uh, D-Dr. Warren was just giving me an update.
you're a doctor?
Dr. Warren, this is my son, um...
Joey, right?
how do you know about Joey?
Eric gave Joey as a contact. It's okay, Mom.
why would Eric be asking for Joey? - Relax, Mom.
I'm Eric's younger brother, Scott.
I've been staying in town with my mother since...
Joey died in an accident six months ago.
I'm really sorry.
please, Dr. Warren.
I can't lose another son.
I understand, Mrs. Schwartz.
how's Agniska doing?
Agniska's got fluid pooling behind her liver.
her bladder looked irregular.
ruptured?
what happened to your face?
just... water gun incident.
don't ask.
bladder rupture, liver laceration.
pelvic and tibia fracture, brachial artery injury.
let's get a retrograde urethrogram to confirm the bladder rupture and have ortho, urology and vascular scrub in for the other issues.
can we get a damn translator in here?
whoa, sir.
are you the translator?
no, Bolek Dabrowski. He's the husband of the driver of the car.
I was told that my wife was taken here, but I can't find her anywhere.
we only got two cases from the crash.
what about the ER?
if you can help us translate with Agniska, we'll find out - where your wife's been taken. - Of course, of course.
pressure's dropping.
let's move it, people.
I need an O. R. for Agniska Vivika and ortho, urology and vascular.
already paged.
Oh, Tuck asked me to make some calls about your mother's earring.
I talked to the diner where you had breakfast and the gas station.
so far nothing.
thanks for trying, Lynn.
his name is Jackson Russel.
who? - Our missing Mr. Water Gun.
trach scar got me thinking, so I went to Admin.
Bravo Team did the intake nine months ago
gunshot to the back--but I discharged him.
guy hummed constantly.
he hummed?
if it's the same guy, yeah. Same tune over and over.
can't remember what it was, but I was able to pull his medical records.
bullet went to the heart.
we put in a mechanical valve.
and he's on a blood thinner-- warfarin
which the ER confirmed with an INR before he went AWOL.
wait. Levels are way too high.
warfarin toxicity.
well, if he's a psych patient, he may be double-dosing on his medication.
with that level of blood thinner, his foot won't clot.
I mean, he can bleed out within a matter of hours.
put out an internal APB.
guy's got to be here somewhere.
and if he is, I'm gonna find him.
Mr. Schwartz.
we're going to do a ventriculostomy, put a tube into your brain to drain some of the fluid and reduce the pressure.
not Mom-- Joey.
it's okay, Eric. Just try to...
wait a minute.
I'm not doing that.
focal seizures.
follow my finger.
he's got a fixed gaze.
get him intubated and prepped.
tell the anesthesiologist to start lorazepam for the seizures.
let's take a look at his latest CTs.
brain swelling's too severe to do a ventriculostomy.
let's page Neurosurge, prep his belly.
his belly?
we're going to do a hemi?
Yeah.
we're going to do a hemi.
hang on, I'm confused.
what's a hemi?
a hemicraniectomy.
the top of the skull is removed, and the opening is secured by sewing the dura and the scalp together.
and this allows room for the brain to swell without damage.
but why open the belly if the swelling is in the brain?
I can show you.
excuse me.
okay, so let's imagine, the chicken is your head, right?
and the baked potato is your belly.
first, we slice off the top of the chicken like so, and we set it aside.
so what happens when we leave chicken out for too long?
it rots, right? We could freeze it, but then frozen chicken never tastes quite the same, does it?
so, we slice open the belly, make a little room.
and we put the skull inside.
this allows room for the brain to expand, decreasing the pressure, and the skull can stay viable inside the body cavity a bit like a warmer until we're ready to reattach it.
so now we got two critical patients and two O. R.s running.
anyone here play dominoes?
in, uh, O. R. 1, we brought in Dr. Rasual from Neurosurge to, uh, take off the top of the skull of our cyclist, while Dr. Warren and I created the abdominal pouch to store the bone.
meanwhile, in the other O. R.
drs. Zambrano and Deleo repaired the liver lacerations on the passenger from the car.
Dr. Sullos from Orthopedics set her fractured tibia, and Dr. Goodman from Vascular did the reconstruction on her damaged brachial artery
on deck, surgeons from Urology were set do a bladder reconstruction.
ten doctors, all working to try and save two lives.
which brings us back to our missing homeless guy.
you think he's in there?
we have any other homeless foot lacerations on the loose today?
wait.
shouldn't you wait for security? He was armed.
with a water weapon. I think he's only a threat to the Wicked Witch of the West.
some more blood on the floor.
he couldn't have gone anywhere. The footprints only lead in.
david Blaine has nothing on this guy.
abdominal dressing is in place.
and vital signs all look good.
let's get Eric into the ICU for close monitoring.
it's wide complex tachycardia.
I'll grab paddles to shock.
no, no, no. Hold on. It's not a shockable rhythm.
look at the twisting pattern of the QRS complexes.
it's not V tach.
it's torsades.
try overdrive pacing to take control of his heart. Push two migs of magnesium, get him back into rhythm.
overdrive pacing now.
watch his rhythm.
he's back in sinus.
his brain swelling shouldn't trigger torsades. Did we miss a heart trauma?
no, he had a chest CT and an echo-- both totally normal.
so you think the heart dysrhythmia is unrelated to the trauma?
I don't know. Let's find out. I'll get him moved, you get a full medical history, including exactly how his brother Joey died. All right?
just got a hold of Dispatch. They finally tracked down Agniska's cousin, Gosia Dabrowski
she was taken to Lashbrook Community Hospital.
Lashbrook? - Mmm.
they're only a level 3 trauma center.
I know. Paramedics misrouted her to the nearest hospital.
what happened now?
vascular stuck me with a scalpel.
it was clean.
God, you are having a day.
at Lashbrook? - Yeah.
I'm going to tell the husband, and I've paged the attending there to see if I can find out more about the case.
I've got no time, Carl. No time.
you've got to have time, Matt.
technically, I'm your boss.
technically, I've got a patient whose heart just stopped beating for no reason. Got to go.
fine. I'll keep talking while you do.
so, about the fund-raising presentation.
it'll only take an hour, and all you have to do is be charming.
which I won't be, Carl.
cause I yammer, pick fights, use food as inappropriate props.
give me a scalpel and some sutures, fine, but stumping up for a new wing...
this is not about a new wing.
trauma has two sources of funding.
I know how Trauma is funded.
one is government, the other is private.
the feds are pulling back, the state has a $3 billion budget shortfall, the city can't even pick up the trash.
and that brings us back to private citizens.
what about the head of Bravo Team?
ronson has the flu.
Verduga from Charlie Team has done it four years running.
nobody wants to hear from me.
which leaves us with the mysterious new guy who everyone is dying to meet.
I did this three times in Maryland, and three times
I couldn't raise a dime.
Matt, we're considering cutting back surgeons, laying off staff.
okay.
I'll get you some talking points.
talking points are fine.
but if you're expecting me to save people's jobs...
...tell them to update their resumes.
but Eric's a triathlete.
he's never had anything worse than a cold.
what about with his heart?
his heart? - Mom, it's okay.
but-but I thought he has a brain injury.
he does, but during surgery, his heart showed an abnormal rhythm.
we need to know of any pre-existing conditions or injuries.
Eric's as healthy as a horse, same as Scott.
what about Joey?
I'm sorry to have to bring it up, but it would be really helpful to know how your son died, in case it might have any bearing on Eric.
Joey drowned.
it was off the coast near Sommerville, South Carolina.
I still say he was hit by a boat. He was too strong a swimmer.
ma.
he had a couple of beers; tide was going out.
that's it.
are you bleeding?
Oh, no, he-he's not.
but you are.
look out!
I need a lift team and a gurney!
Scott! What's wrong with him?
Scott! Why is he shaking like this?
make that two lift teams and two gurneys!
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
the passenger in the car, the homeless guy, the bicyclist and now the brother of the bicyclist?
you said three patients before.
did I?
well, now there are four.
how the hell did he get in the ceiling?
ductwork in the back of the supply closet.
guy must have crawled 400 feet through three-by-three tubing.
pressure's 60/30.
severely anemic from blood loss.
blood bank says it'll take an hour to thaw fresh frozen plasma to reverse the anticoagulation.
can't wait for the FFP.
bag of factor IX complex and I. V. vitamin K and keep transfusing.
where... where am I?
Hey, there, Jackson.
I-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I hope I didn't scare you too much.
no apology necessary.
just let us take care of your foot, okay?
can you breathe deeply for me, Scott?
I'm fine.
you were passed out and twitching.
because some guy almost fell on me.
"guy almost fell on me" is not a known cause for twitching and fainting.
EKG looks fine.
bp's normal.
everything normal.
I told you I'm fine.
infected.
he's been running around in dirty gauze all day.
Hey, hey, Jackson, you were right.
we do know each other.
we do?
I was the discharge nurse when you got shot.
you hummed your way right out of the door.
I don't think I've ever hummed in my whole life.
maybe I'm confused.
maybe I'm confused.
I'm on so many meds.
sometimes I'm not sure what's real.
you ever have that problem?
wound can't be closed here.
infected area needs to be debrided.
I'll call up and have an O. R. prepped.
Hey, Jackson, we're gonna fix your foot up. You're gonna be just fine.
it's not my foot... my mind.
please, fix my mind.
update on the two brothers:
Eric's abdomen incision site looks good.
his vitals are stable, but his brain is still swelling to critical levels.
nothing we can do now but wait and hope.
Scott's also stable.
no signs of seizures in either.
where did you get the dominoes?
in a bag in the break room.
Eric has seizures and heart dysrhythmia.
Scott, maybe seizures and no dysrhythmia.
and Joey...
accident.
unless it wasn't.
mediocre minds think alike.
speak for yourself.
so he's swimming, he has some sort of episode, and he drowns.
no one does an autopsy.
let's assume Joey had seizures.
Scott has seizures.
Scott said he'd never had seizures before.
underlying condition that's been lying dormant, brought to the surface by the stress.
we know Eric has seizures.
Eric's seizures were caused by increing pressure in his brain.
what if the seizures were triggered by the pressure but the condition existed all along?
so, epilepsy.
worth a test, right?
I talked to a Dr. Ebel over at Lashbrook.
Gosia Dabrowski is in critical condition with a severe liver injury and a pelvic fracture.
it's the same as our patient.
but they don't have an in-house trauma team, and the surgeons won't be there for 50 mins? We're 20 by ambulance. Tell them to pack her. We'll have an O. R. prepped and free.
I'm going to see Gosia.
no, you don't have to go anywhere.
we're having her transferred here.
here? - Yeah.
we've determined we can take better care of her here than where she was.
and Agniska?
she's in ICU recovering.
Gosia and I, we have a new baby, Danusia, two months old.
and today was the first day Gosia was even away from her.
how does a thing like this happen?
excuse me.
I'm l turned around.
I got a call.
I'm looking for Jackson Russel.
you next of kin?
Yeah, I'm his wife.
jackson used to own a landscaping business.
everything he touched bloomed.
nine months ago, he was making a deposit at an ATM when he, uh...
he got shot. We know.
after his surgery, he got pretty depressed.
there was just a lot of stuff he couldn't do.
he had to stop working.
he lost the business.
we went to see doctors, lots of doctors.
and now he has these episodes where he just disappears.
I haven't seen him in three weeks.
do you know what medications he's on?
what is he not on?
they're divided by days of the week.
I don't even know what they are.
there's red round one, the blue oval one and the diamond-shaped pink one that he takes twice a day.
did...
did he ask for me?
I'm not sure.
did he say anything at all?
he asked us to heal his mind.
Yeah, I've kinda given up hope for that.
Oh, and I'm supposed to get a page as soon as Jackson Russel's in the ICU with antibiotics running.
and I think we should get new labs on Agniska...
Oh! Look out! Oh, God. - I'm sorry, Dr. Zambrano.
it's okay. - Sorry
you need to just go home before you get hit by lightning.
you really are having a bad day.
let me see. Is your toe broken?
this about your mother's earring?
getting all puked on?
a nail.
I was talking to Kleebus. He said all these people's lives were upended by one nail.
can it really all be that random?
do you want the truth?
no, Chris, lie to me.
probably, yeah.
well, it makes it very hard to sleep at night
see, I solved that problem years ago.
how?
I don't sleep.
this isn't so bad.
I thought it was gonna hurt.
we could get your mom to watch if you think it'd help.
no.
no, I'm trying not to completely freak her out.
ever since Joey drowned, she's got to have me in her sight, like, 24 hours a day.
she calls Eric, like, every 15 minutes.
she just hasn't been able to accept what happened.
I'm fine. Just go back to working on Eri...
he's out again.
I see it. Scott!
Mr. Schwartz?
so epilepsy. You were right.
no...
I was dead wrong.
totally, completely 100% wrong.
there's no twitching.
the EEG shows no seizure activity.
that's because it isn't a seizure.
scrap the EEG.
run the EKG.
we already did. It was normal.
Flecainide, please.
let's see how it reads after I push this.
Eric's seizures were related to his trauma.
and Scott's seizures, they weren't seizures at all, but the three brothers' problems were linked.
linked by what?
sudden unexpected death syndrome.
sudden unexpected death syndrome
or Brugada
is a genetic disease. It wasn't even recognized until 1992.
there are no symptoms, no prior warnings until it presents as a heart arrhythmia brought on by severe physical or emotional stress a head trauma...
long swim.
someone crashing through a ceiling next to them.
now, Brugada effects less than one percent of the population, but it's the exact demographic into which the three brothers fall.
so what can you do about this?
implant an internal defibrillator which will give a shock if it senses an abnormal heart rhythm.
could you say that again in English?
we're sending Scott to be fitted with a special pacemaker that will regulate his heart and ensure that this won't happen again.
and as soon as Eric has recovered from his head trauma, he'll be fitted for one, too.
so both my boys have this Brugada thing?
actually, we think all of your sons may have had it, Mrs. Schwartz.
and that's why Joey drowned?
we think he may have had an attack while swimming.
at least that's our theory.
Mrs. Schwartz, um, we can't guarantee that your two sons won't be hit by a bus...
but we can guarantee they won't die of this.
thank you.
thank you. Thank you, too. - That's okay.
I'm no psychiatrist, but there's no way he should be taking three antipsychotics and two antidepressants along with his warfarin.
the worse he got emotionally, the more doctors he saw, the more pills he got.
I'm gonna schedule a Psych consult with Dr. Minyard.
he'll be better at sorting this thing out.
he talk about cameras?
about people following him?
but didn't mention me?
I mostly just tried to keep clam, Mrs. Russel.
and I think I may have mistook him for someone.
who?
patient we once had, guy hummed a lot.
hummed?
Mr. Russel just woke up.
page Dr. Zambrano.
I'll be right back.
how are you feeling?
a little shaky.
we're working on that.
your numbers look good, Mr. Russel, and Dr. Zambrano is on her way to see you.
in the meantime, is there anything I can do?
can you turn that thing off? I don't like people watching me.
anything else?
no.
I have a... I have a wife.
I don't like her to see me when I get this way. If...
you could call her and let her know where
I'm kind of a mess here.
nurse Brody and I have been talking about that.
he thinks he might be able to hook us up with a doctor, one doctor, who might help clear things up.
Really?
we're gonna see what we can do.
Mr. Brody?
the humming?
was it this...
Yes.
our wedding dance.
you used to hum that every morning while you loaded your truck.
Yeah. I did... I used to hum.
I miss that guy.
wait. I don't get it.
the brothers get pacemakers.
the Polish woman is in ICU.
and the homeless guy's foot is healing.
so, who died?
anybody?
the one who didn't get there in time.
Gosia Dabrowski, 27 years old, transferred from Kendall Community.
multiple abdominal injuries, BP is 40 palp with a weak pulse.
she'll never make it upstairs. Pressure's too low. Let's go into Trauma 2.
abdomen's filled with blood.
should've been in an O. R.an hour ago.
she's bradying down.
asystole. Damn it.
starting CPR.
get a crash cart.
give her one of epi and atropine.
open up a thoracotomy tray.
we have to cross-clamp the aorta.
I'm on it.
give me a rib spreader.
I was paged to the O. R.
Yeah, didn't make it that far.
patient arrested.
heart's not beating.
give me a clamp.
got it.
heart's still not beating.
starting internal compressions.
keep the blood flowing.
Gosia, come on.
we worked for an hour and a half...
but we couldn't get her stable enough to get her to the O. R.
now, I know you resent the, uh, same stuffy room, the uncomfortable chairs.
being asked, yet again, to open...
your checkbooks.
do you know what I resent?
I resent having to tell the father of a two-month-old baby that his wife is dead, because the trauma facility to which she was sent didn't have the resources to save her.
you know the, uh, process of treating a trauma patient is, um.
is a bit like these dominoes.
three patients, three trauma suites, two O. R.s, 17 specialists, all less than five minutes away.
now, if everything goes according to plan...
...then each element will fall into the next and, uh, three patients are saved.
but if not...
or if we don't exist and that patient is just sent to the closest hospital...
born 23rd of March, 1979,
Warsaw, Poland.
died 4: 58 p. m. yesterday,
Miami...
Florida.
thanks for your time.
don't start.
I'm down to lost and found clothing.
well, speaking of cats...
and dogs.
Oh, no. my car!
I forgot I had the top off.
it's soaked! I can give you a ride home.
Yeah, I swear, everything I have has either been spilled on rained on or puked on.
you can look inside your Goodwill bag for something.
sorry, I didn't get around to it.
that's totally fine.
somewhere between my fashion mistakes from the '90s and my ex-boyfriend's junk, I'm sure I'll find something to wear.
Oh, it's hideous, but at least it'll get me to your car, right?
it fell out of the bag.
my mother's earring.
if I hadn't had my rotten morning, I would've made it to Goodwill.
if I hadn't been puked on, never would've run out of clothing.
if it hadn't been raining, never would've reached in that bag.
if I hadn't reached in that bag...
Eva finds meaning in the chaos.
I don't know about that but...
at least I'll sleep tonight.
sorry, Carl, I went off script.
well, the dominoes were a nice touch.
so, um, how'd I do?
you are no longer the guy who's never raised a dime.
but...
how many dimes? Better than Ronson?
better than Verduga?
look, Matt, what's important is that you were willing to step up at the last minute.
Dr. Willis?
this is for you.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
and you dropped this.
keep it as a souvenir.
see you next year?
Yeah. Sure.
same uncomfortable chairs.
same dry chicken.
Dr. Willis?
Yes. - A moment please.
Thanks.
victory!
CALUGARENI
for more than one hundred years,
europe has trembled under the attacks of the Ottoman armies.
1593
sultan Murad III urges his troops to Vienna, under Sinan Pasha's command, to defeat the last obstacle between them and a divided Europe.
as a miracle repeating over and over along the centuries, these armies have to face three insignificant principalities:
Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldavia.
all three would play a crucial role in this battle.
in these troubled times, a man would rise in the right place, to fulfill its destiny.
Patrascu's son was meant to perish, to flea or to win the battle, to become a prince.
michael THE BRAVE THE BATTLE OF CALUGARENI
eat, milords!
feed yourselves! I see you're weak!
or maybe you don't enjoy my lunch.
of course we do!
is it good? - Yes, it is!
do you hear me, Pavel? This will teach you to rise against me again!
spike him!
eat! Don't you like it? - Of course we do, Your Highness.
they're afraid of me. But it's the only way, in these times.
I am faithful to you, Selim Pasha. Tell it to the mighty sultan!
I gave you two chariots full of healthy children.
I know we don't have do it anymore, but...
I'd give you two chariots of gold, if you gave me you know whose head.
what if he deserves more?
voivode Alexandru has forgiven you!
no. As I haven't forgiven him.
Michael, I was always your shadow. I did what you wanted me to do.
our home has turned to ashes. We are hiding abroad.
the voivode has put a price on your head. Where will it end?
I'll go all the way, Stanca, no matter where it may lead me.
Alexandru's men are after me. I stopped just for a moment.
Where's Nicolae?
I hid him. - Where?
I'll take him with me. - No.
his life is in danger. Alexandru will want revenge, if he sees I'm gone.
no. You can't have him. - I'm not used to this kind of words.
you should learn. You've taken everything from me, Michael.
even if you succeed, you can't give me back my serene and short happiness.
don't worry! No one will touch my son. Not even you.
especially you.
as you have risen against him, Voivode Alexandru has ordered your capture, General of Craiova!
not inside the church.
I fear a trap.
you're handsome, but stupid, Hassan.
don't you understand? I made a promise.
there's too much silence.
they, too, feel something in the air.
Selim Pasha...
the Buzesti brothers...
you're right on time, Mihal. How did you get away?
it was easy, Selim.
Radu... Father Stoica... Brothers, let them pass this time!
only this time.
but without the children!
nobody move!
for the love of me, let them pass with what they have!
these are children from our land.
why, Michael?
without his help, I can't go to Istanbul.
I know him well enough to know he never let his pray loose.
Selim is my childhood friend. Please, let him pass!
make way! Let them pass!
Michael!
mother...
you, too, have sold them your soul. The son of Voivode Patrascu...
you don't care about anything! You want the throne at any cost!
you'd cover yourself in shame! I damn you for all eternity!
you stand and watch your foe mocking your people!
don't curse me, mother!
the Prophet's teachings are great, but I still don't understand.
why do you need to rule over such a wretched country?
I want to be the mightiest man in this country.
Mihal, my friend... Here, we are the mightiest of all.
look at me!
which one of you is stronger?
does anyone dare fight him?
you! Come here!
do you want this knife?
Yes, sir.
you have to earn it. - I will, sir!
punch him!
beat him!
do as I tell you!
do as I tell you!
wait!
now you beat him!
enough!
get up!
kill him!
these are my children, Mihal.
what's your name?
Hassan. Before, when I was ugly and dirty, it was Ionica.
now it's Hassan. You can kill me, you're still an unfaithful to me.
you learned to contain yourself, but not entirely.
had I not loved you, I would've had to kill you.
maybe you'll be sorry you didn't do it.
you haven't changed, Mihal.
selim, I want to ask you something. - I'm listening.
why did you join Sinan Pasha's army?
Allah whispered to me that one day I could become grand vizier.
you're dreaming, Selim.
Mihal, will your uncle Lani give you the money?
I don't know.
two days ago, Alexandru offered me two chariots of gold for your head, and now I'm losing mine, going along with you.
Allah didn't give me the brains my mother would've wanted him to.
this one will make us rich.
if he's willing to pay this much, how much money does he make?
let him pay! We'll settle later.
Mihal! Alexandru's here.
Lani, give him whatever he asks for!
think again, Michali! This is a great deal of money.
no. We'll pay what he asks.
come on! Move! Get out!
we need another 300000 coins.
I gave you my entire wealth. I swear on my beard!
I'll pay you back. - Yes, but you know how it goes...
520000 coins in all. This means 543000, interest included.
I told you it's not enough. - Sign here!
I talked to Di Ventini, the richest banker of the Genovese quarter.
he's waiting for you. - Di Ventini...
you won't see a coin from him. - Why, Selim? How do you know?
he won't pay even his respects.
I'm sorry, Signor Michele, but I'm afraid I have to say no.
Rosana!
this is Prince Michele.
if there is any other problem, I am your humble servant.
Rosana, you entertain the prince!
my brother Carlo is the image of our much praised impetuosity.
I am Rosana.
I'm curious... Could you tell me the subject of your conversation?
I'm sure you heard everything, Contessina.
it's so exciting to see men fight for their goals!
you then start to see their weak points, their touching side.
you didn't plea for your cause too well.
I'm not used to asking. - Then how will you get anything?
I've been living here for many years. It's a strange world.
the shortest way is never the right one.
a smile may bring death, while a frowning, life.
let me ask you something! How old are you, Contessina?
prince... Is the house of Di Ventini your last option?
Yes.
what if you don't get the money? - I die.
you don't seem a man of simple judgments.
Contessina Rosana, have you ever thought that there are men who wait to watch the sun?
for them, this moment may never come, but they still are trying.
what did the dame say? She's the one who runs the business.
what did she say? Tell me word for word!
she said this was a strange world. - Will she give you the money?
I don't know. She didn't say anything.
is she beautiful? - Why?
this means you've grown older than me.
Mihal, think it over! We still may leave tomorrow, alive and well.
my money...
Ventini afendi...
please, come in, Your Excellency!
Signorina Contessa, I'm your humble servant.
my sister was so curious to see your true oriental decorations, that she convinced me to take her with me.
today I tried to look at the sun. It's hard.
my eyes were full of tears. - Thank you, Contessina.
Signor principe, our house thanks you for your demand.
our mild doubts had nothing to do with you.
I tossed and turned in my bed all night long.
if Alexandru pays Sinan Pasha a greater sum, it's your head the sultan will cut off, dear nephew!
look at him, pig! Woe to us!
Sinan Pasha agreed to take your money. He wants to see you.
you should barely speak. He's wreckless and moody.
you miserable sod!
is this him?
young man, where do you think you are? At the Court of Rome?
before the mighty sultan, you bow to the ground and kiss his slipper.
let me see you!
right... That's it. Rise!
you made a good first impression. I heard good things about you.
you walk in fear of God, you are rich...
I heard very bad things about your rival Alexandru.
we learned some proof about his betrayal to the great sultan.
but... you may not be to his liking, either.
your Highness, we did everything to please the almighty sultan.
did anyone ask you anything? Let's go!
we don't know what the thoughts of this man are, while Alexandru has always submitted to us.
there's Alexandru!
dear Christ... Help us, Virgin Mary!
only Allah can help you here.
have mercy on me, almighty!
have mercy, great sultan!
the hearing's over.
wait! Stay a little longer!
leave us alone!
come with me!
I like you. Here, all you see is crawling backs, even those who have the hoofs of their horses full of Europe's dust.
but I could've not liked you.
how could you dare?
we only have one life, almighty sultan!
right... Too bad!
master! Have mercy on me! Almighty sultan!
Murad! You'll be sorry!
you'll be sorry to have chosen him!
Mihal bey, what do you think is Allah's most precious gift to man?
life. - You couldn't have said otherwise.
you're too insignificant.
you'll be reigning over a small land.
one day, your lords will bribe my men, as you did, and I will give the order.
man's greatest gift is power, Mihal.
the most precious one and the most tiresome.
listen! - I'm listening, almighty one.
when you leave, you'll be a poor prince of some small country.
your neighbours will humiliate you, you'll fear us... Stay here!
when young, Sinan was a Christian, too.
I'll give you an army and then you'll know what power is.
what do you say?
I'm not an army man and I don't want to disappoint you.
I care too much for my head. - Too bad!
Allah will sometimes put petty souls into strong bodies.
Why?
what was Alexandru shouting? - That you'll be sorry you chose me.
you don't care too much for your head.
indeed, I may be sorry one day that I chose you.
why don't you get in, Your Highness? Everybody wants to meet you.
I came here to thank you. I must leave.
I'm sorry. - Why did you help me?
you're not like the people that usually ask us for money.
I was impressed to see that you didn't know how to beg.
do you know where my country is? - Now I do. East of Transylvania.
I'll be travelling there soon, at Alba Lulia.
a friend of mine, Christina von Habsburg, is getting married to Prince Sigismund.
I'll be close to your country and, normally, I want to know what happens to my money.
I'm talking nonsense. I'd very much like to know your country.
bucharest - December 1594
we've been robbed! - Give us our money!
they locked the gates!
they robbed us! They must pay their debt!
why are you laughing?
I barely saw my father. We've been hiding, he was on the road...
I don't even know if I can recognize him, dressed like a prince.
he got to the throne with our money!
pay your debts!
give us our money! You robbed us, you thieves!
give us our money, you thieves!
let him come outside and pay his debt!
be courageous!
I'm glad I find you in good health, Your Highness.
what kind of a ruler is he? He never pays his debts!
he's hiding! - Michael, what's going on?
nothing.
who are these men? Why are they shouting?
you're imagining things, Stanca.
Nicolae! - Preda!
I'm so glad to see you! - Nicolae!
welcome! Come with me!
Preda...
present our son to the Lords' Council!
wait! You don't need these trinkles.
don't you have anything to say to me?
I missed you, Stanca. I waited for your arrival.
thank you, especially because it's not true.
you put your life at risk for this throne, Michael.
was it worth...
milady, your rooms are ready.
Radu! - Enough! Silence! Stop whining!
I want to know if you give me the money or not.
we've already done it once. We're wondering...
what, Filimon? Do you or don't you have money for the Turks?
what about the gold coins I gave you?
you're buying weapons, but never pay the tribute.
who spoke?
I am too dumb to speak, but, if we can, we'll pray...
pray in church, milord, for forgiveness!
the Turks don't forget about their tribute.
we're a cursed country, Your Highness. We're poor.
what did you decide? - We're with you, Your Highness.
stand straight, Nicolae!
what do you say?
Buzesti! Selim bey is free to enter wherever he wants.
he should see how faithful we are to the great sultan.
faithful? You haven't paid the legal tribute for six months.
the soldiers who guard your throne didn't receive their pay.
Sinan Pasha is upset. This is why I'm here.
the country is poor, Selim bey.
didn't you know it when you asked to be prince?
Stroe!
Selim Pasha...
even though some lords don't want to pay anything, all the debts of my country will be paid today.
we have gathered the money in the house of the brothers Buzesti.
I want to please everybody. Announce the crowd!
you came a long way, Selim. - A very long way, Mihal.
is it ready?
Yes. Do come in! We'll pay for everything!
thank you.
he lives in fear of the Turks. - You said it!
if it weren't for them...
I was ordered to speak to you like this and this is what I did.
you can kill me, Mihal, but I don't know why you wanted to rule here.
I know what you're worth. Earlier, I was talking to the prince, not to my friend.
I know, Selim. I thank you for this.
Stroe!
to the charriots!
Mihal!
I liked it! Now I recognize you!
like in the old days!
jump, Selim!
selim, take your horse, go to Sinan and tell him what you saw!
you are free. You talked to me in two different ways. I answered the same.
what is it, Radu?
it's the house we were born in, Your Highness. But we are glad.
don't worry! It was old, anyway.
long live the prince!
forgive me, son, for not trusting you.
I'm sorry. - What did you think, mother?
is this what you think of me? That I can sell my country?
and you? What did you think? That I, Voivode Michael, would drink this cup of shame to the last drop?
from this day on, I free myself in front of God and you of any debt and submission!
and I will free all those who are with me!
we have our life and our honour!
wake up! We've been sleeping too long!
the existence of a wall between us and the Ottoman Empire is mandatory.
the territory of the 3 principalities must come to our attention.
as we appreciate the determination and noble courage of Sigismund Bathory, prince of Transylvania, who cast away the Ottoman rule and became our precious vassal, we chose our nephew, archduchess Maria Christina de Gratz, to be the valliant prince's wife.
calm down, Sigismund!
this marriage is to show the world we want to make the prince...
my dear cousin, if my adhesion to the Christian cause forces me to suffer the martyrdom of this marriage...
general Basta will ensure with our troops Transylvania's independence.
your Majesty...
gentlemen...
I'm happy.
I've always dreamt of becoming a humble protector of the cross, of giving my life in revenge of the sacred wounds of our Saviour.
this day...
dear Boris, the fate of our coalition is sealed.
the fate of the two neighbouring countries is of great concern to me.
here are the messengers of prince Aron of Moldavia, who announced that they accepted to be vassals of Transylvania.
you'll make friends with the devil, to meet your goal.
I will properly settle things with Wallachia.
this young man walks on my nerves.
prince Sigismund, don't forget Wallachia is under Turkish rule.
does Your Majesty think Murad would invade Wallachia?
in his place, wouldn't we do the same?
what do you know about the new prince...
...Michael Patrascu?
he's a most unreliable character, Your Majesty.
with money and shrewdness, he bought the throne from Sinan, whom he seems to be friends with.
he has recently paid his creditors by setting them on fire, like boars.
what can we think of a man who meets his commitments in such a manner?
he's an adventurer.
he wants to gather money and leave for a quiet corner of Europe.
your Eminency, we are glad you are so well informed.
what other details do you know, General Basta?
your Majesty, as a tactician, I'm interested in two things:
our enemy and our ally.
I understand prince Sigismund wants Wallachia to be our battle ground.
we must protect the dwellings of the civilized world, Your Majesty.
Wallachia is a country only by name. It has no master.
braila
Cernavoda and Zimnicea
Nicopole and Vidin
get up, Preda! There's more 'till Istanbul.
down with your weapons!
Rusciuk
on your knees!
Preda! - I'm here, milord!
Preda, do you remember your Latin? - Yes. I learned it in Padua.
let me hear you!
good... Tonight you will prepare for a long journey.
milord... Now, when... - Preda Buzescu!
tonight you're leaving for Rome.
your deeds are worthy of your Roman ancestors.
tell the valliant prince Michael that he is not facing alone this pagan Goliath.
can we then count on the help of the Holy Roman Church?
the Romans were famed for their practicality.
I'm glad to see this virtue has not wasted away.
tell prince Michael that the Holy Roman Church will support his actions not only through its warm prayers, but with all its financial might.
how can I interpret these precious words, Holy Father?
I see why you're saying this.
the army of Rudolph of Austria will join you at the soonest.
in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, amen.
as for us, my son... Big words, but petty interests!
I can assure the Holy Father that I'm in great difficulty.
I could bearly soothe the pure passion of prince Sigismund.
but General Basta's ambitions... - Plots and childish pride!
you've been everywhere, but you never said a word about this Wallachian prince.
your Holiness, all our reports saw him as faithful to the Turks.
he seemed unreliable.
this unreliable man makes his way to Istanbul by sword, Your Eminence.
you will go His Majesty king Rudolph and you will see that Basta's army leaves right now to the help of prince Michael.
Benedico te.
charge!
Stanesti and Serpatesti

Adrianopolis
what is this?
Selim Pasha's coming. - Selim Pasha? How dare he?
how can you have the courage to come to my face?
you bastard! You had the nerve to tell me you knew him.
didn't you ever suspect anything? - No.
then, you're a fool.
what do you think he'll do? - He's cunning and swift.
he'll fight us until the end. If he gets help...
he will conquer Istanbul, before I get the chance to be there.
and I wander through these sands... It's only your fault!
who sent you here?
the almighty sultan is waiting for you in Istanbul, the soonest.
what about you?
the great sultan made me head of the armies that fight in Persia.
charge!
go get them, brothers!
my God, Father... So much water!
it's salty!
Prague, 1595
it was just the right moment. Sinan was busy fighting in Persia.
the Wallachians' attack took the Turks by surprise.
general, you explain everything in such a crude manner! Funny...
didn't you invite this prince to the Council's round table?
I, for one, cannot trust him.
his victories are the result of hazard.
your Eminency, what do you think? - The Lord works in mysterious ways.
indeed. This unreliable man who used to pay tribute to the Turks has amazed the entire Europe. We must help him.
allow me to take leave, Your Majesty.
a brilliant tactician with the pride of a child!
the mere idea of another's success makes him hate him, even if he doesn't know him.
what is the Holy Father's advice to me?
your Majesty, this time I bring you the gold promised to the Holy League, to gather an army against the pagans.
you should've told me this great news at the beginning of our hearing.
I must confess this is a most pleasant surprise.
I'm happy I can be of some use to you, Your Majesty.
still, I'm worried. - I'm listening, Your Eminency.
do you think we can trust this stranger with the gold that the Holy Roman Church wishes to donate to the Crusade?
I was thinking that prince Sigismund was the most...
don't get me wrong! I won't have it.
I'm not that mad as to give the much awaited money to the first comer.
we will organize an army. You will go meet prince Michael.
you will crawl inside his soul, a primitive one, I suppose, and you will give us details and then we will decide.
I'm anxious to see prince Michael among so many heroes!
I have the feeling I see scenes from the Iliad.
your Highness... Our Holy Father sends you this cross, as a sign of that which you are fighting for.
when will the army arrive?
preparations are almost ready.
the Holy Father and Emperor Rudolph decided to give you all the support you asked for.
the great General Basta will join swords with your invincible army.
when?
in five months. - Five months?
you're too great a tactician, not to see that such an attack takes time.
look over there, Your Eminency!
and there. Do you know what these warriors expect? To raise my arm and tell them that 10, 000 mighty soldiers came to their help.
then, they would howl for joy and bring down the walls of Istanbul!
with or without Basta, I would have been there in a week.
Preda! - Yes, milord!
call the men! We're going home.
how, milord?
if I hear another word, I'll cut your head off!
your Eminency, maybe I was wrong to ask for help in Rome.
you're the cousin of prince Sigismund.
do you think he would agree to help me keep the Turks to the Danube, until the Christian army gathers up?
you were right to think about your Transylvanian brother.
you'd better ask him personally. I will bless the friendship between two princes reigning over two neighbouring countries.
then, we'll leave together.
the noble count Gaspar Cornis, great champion of the Hussars, is honoured to fight against the prince of Transylvania,
Sigismund of Bathory!
I dedicate my battle to the noble lady, the archduchess Maria Christina of Austria, and I will fight to prove it.
I hope that, after our wedding, the prince will find a better way to waste his energy.
do you love him? - He's nice, but he's childish.
you talk to your prince! He's awful. Do you think he can speak?
anyway, he knew.
your Highness, today it's sunny, the colours are shining...
won't you smile?
you're right. I was deep in my thoughts.
forgive me! I didn't want to upset you.
I don't have this right, Rosana. I owe you money.
had we been to Bucharest, would you have set me on fire?
what kind of a man is Sigismund? - He's the way you see him.
had I taken him out with a pole, he wouldn't have stood up.
Applaud!
michael of Wallachia!
I'd like us to start our friendship with a chivalrous contest!
don't say yes! For Christ's sake!
my dear friend, we are not here to fight and have fun.
your Highness, fighting with the lance is a knight's pride.
I thank you for making me this honour, Sigismund.
don't, Michael!
prince Sigismund of Bathory, never beaten!
he will face prince Michael of Wallachia!
dear God, help him! - Who's he?
voivode Michael, the one who beats the Turks.
you can't compete without a helmet! It's against the rules!
let's hope God will teach him a lesson. It'd be best for everyone.
you can't do it! It's against the rules!
go on!
he asked for it.
Rosana Di Ventini, you never told me anything!
are you all right? Anything broken?
no. I'm fine.
you're crazy. Don't you know he did it for you?
my God! You shook him hard! - He bit the dust! He asked for it.
your Highness, no matter how much my pride has to suffer,
I'm honoured to shake your hand.
you deserved this victory. - It was an accident.
No! Please! You proved to be a fine handler of the lance.
milord... We don't have time to fight between us, but with the Turks.
and another thing: They are excellent lancers.
a very subtle politician... Brave as Achilles and shrewd as Ulysses!
I get it, although my cousin the cardinal says I miss subtleties.
you know what? Let's have our talk right here!
it's nice here. It smells like horses.
and strong men. I feel I'm your friend now. Let me speak as such!
I studied your proposals and I agree to them.
may God be with us! Sigismund, I'll tell you something you don't know.
the Turks can be defeated.
my dear friend... Always the same! Right to the point.
I want to ask you... Can you beat them all by yourself?
no. That's why I'm here.
I wouldn't want to offend you.
but, for those who can help you, what are you?
I'm myself. - No, my dear friend.
I'll tell you once again, even if we had to fight again.
you're nothing. Most of the people never heard of your country.
I know you could kill me for these words.
what are your relations to the European courts?
to count on Rudolph's help, I, Sigismund of Bathory, have to marry his niece! Compared to her, Lucrezia Borgia's a saint!
how many men do you have? - All the men in the country.
please... Let's forget about these big words!
I know you're in pain. You're proud.
have you ever received any help, except for the cross that my cousin asked me to send you?
so, it was from you.
we were all wondering who this Michael was and how he was like.
was he a man or was he half bear?
the king of Spain doesn't know his own empire, and you want him to know you?
face the reality! Your actions must be supported by a name that is a guarantee for all European kings!
that is, your name, Sigismund. - Right.
to the entire Christian world, the house of Bathory and that of Habsburg are your only guarantee.
but, if your pride goes before the interest of your country...
think it over!
together with the entire transalpine Wallachia, with all its virtues, and under the merciful and deep protection of the most praised prince of Transylvania, Sigismund Bathory, we, voivode ruling over this country, receive his gracious protection.
our common purpose is to fight against the wretched Crescent.
may God help us!
Amen.
here signs, God willing, the prince of the Sacred Roman Empire, of Transylvania, Moldavia and transalpine Wallachia, count of the Szekely people and ruler of part of Hungaria,
Sigismund Bathory.
here signs our representative Michael Patrascu, our beloved faithful ally.
what was worse is over. Now you can count on our full support.
gentlemen... Let's celebrate!
with all these ceremonies, I didn't get the chance to congratulate you for your many victories. If I ever get the chance,
I will be happy to give you the command of my cavalry.
go to hell!
I wouldn't have believed it possible...
all my hopes were with His Highness Michael...
I was hoping he'd remember us Romanians here, for we are under fierce oppression, milords...
shut up, man!
I was afraid you'd left.
you're so sad, Michael.
may God have mercy on him, if he doesn't keep his word!
I will be the end of him. He'll curse the hour he met me.
what about you, Rosana?
I've been waiting so much to see you!
I imagined our meeting in a hundred ways.
I must tell you...
will we ever see each other again?
if you stay here, yes.
I want to speak to Selim Pasha!
what's the name of the river in front of us?
romanians call it Neajlov.
how many men and cannons do they have?
about 16, 000 men and 20 cannons.
tell me, Selim Pasha... Did you think I'd fight the Wallachian, while you played the hero in Persia?
Yes, Sinan Pasha. That's what I thought.
do you remember you brought him to the Court, to take over his throne?
it's been a long time, but I remember.
tomorrow you will wash away this shame.
Allah be with us!
what's this noise?
mosquitos. We're in swamp land, Your Grace.
milord...
I want to ask you something.
do you want me to make you a metropolitan?
no. I want to stay with the army.
I don't want you to regret one day that we joined our fate, father.
the Lord is stronger and wiser. - Maybe, but this is what I want.
father, guess who's here!
stanca... You, here?
I brought you another 300 horsemen from Oltenia. I knew you'd need them.
you're so brave, Stanca! As always.
Nicolae, my son, go to sleep! We have a hard day tomorrow.
you look worried. - No... I'm just sad.
they let me down again.
I humiliated myself in front of that liar Sigismund!
I thought he was a Christian, just like me.
I thought we'd need one another in front of our enemy.
I was wrong. We have an old saying:
"better an enemy, than a friend who's a liar."
where did you find 300 horsemen?
I gathered them how I could, then I bought weapons and horses.
Michael...
I want to ask you something.
can I do anything for you? Yes. It's very important.
I know that... - Nicolae.
Yes, Nicolae. Let me take him away!
only God knows how tomorrow will end.
he's our child. Your heir.
go, Stanca! Do what you want! Maybe it's my fate to be left alone.
the Transylvanians are here.
count Kiraly!
your Highness...
do you think it was wise to choose such an uncomfortable place?
how many men did you bring, Your Excellency?
500 Szekely men.
my prince and your ruler is disappointed that he couldn't bring his army.
but he is now in Alba Lulia, where he is celebrating his wedding with the duchess Maria Christina of Austria.
500 men? Is this the promised help?
your Highness, my experience as a warrior is greater than you think.
I'm fed up with talks and promises!
father Stoica, show the count where he can place his men!
milord, I'm knight Tompa. You can cut my head off, but it's not my fault.
it's that one... May the Devil take him!
we, the Szekely men, we'll fight with your 'till death.
we know you. We heard a lot about your reign.
all right, Tompa. Thank you.
tomorrow, my sweet wife, you will see a most wonderful tournament.
I hope you'll have enough energy left, to be a winner.
I'm impressed by your cold attitude in front of all these beauties.
you have the most troubling beauty I've ever seen.
I'd give my principality, in exchange for your good will.
your Highness, in politics, deceit may be a virtue.
in love, though, it's the emblem of the weak.
as beautiful as rich and merciless!
in fact, I'd forgotten your heart belonged to our valliant Wallachian.
our vassal...
poor Kiraly! Who knows where he is now?
I don't see why we sent him there. With or without him, the Wallachians will lose the battle.
and, if he wins, who'll rise up to his pride?
win? How do you think that the Wallachian could crush Sinan?
don't get excited, gentlemen! No matter what the outcome, we are still the true winners.
we? - Your Eminency, we planned it all.
have you forgotten that the Wallachian is my vassal?
his victory will make the entire Europe know the bravery of my troops.
if he wins, Sinan will pay dearly.
his weakend army will have less chances in a battle with us.
indeed! He'd even have to build garrisons in the conquered towns.
Sheikban Pasha!
you'll take the command of the centre.
you'll charge the bridge with the Janissaries of the first line.
it must look like the ultimate attack.
I'll send the second line in your support.
you'll go on attacking him 1, 000 steps beyond the bridge, then you'll fall back, as if defeated.
you must lure the Wallachian to this other side of the bridge.
mustafa Pasha!
you'll leave the Wallachian 1, 000 steps from this side of the bridge.
then, you'll charge along the river with your right wing.
Rumelia's armies led by Hassan Pasha will do the same thing on the left.
then, we'll catch him in a clasp.
you may go.
if the Wallachian crosses the bridge, he will fall in our trap.
Satargi Pasha, you stay as reserve, behind the hill.
and you, Selim Pasha, will stay with me.
anything against it?
no, Your Grace.
I haven't seen so many Turks in all my life.
they're like the leaves of grass.
if the Turks cross the bridge, you strike on the side, to the right.
I'll attack them on the left.
father, you help the pedestrians! Don't go back a single step!
it is time. May God help us!
the second line and 20 cannons will enter the battle.
for the bridge, at my command! Charge!
follow me, brave men!
charge!
give the signal!
stop!
don't cross the bridge! It's a trap!
don't cross the bridge! Stop!
do not cross the bridge!
the Wallachian is not stupid. Let all Pashas gather for council!
the Wallachian stopped at the bridge, but he moved all his troops.
he doesn't have any hidden armies.
mustafa, you will make a wide detour with the Anatolian armies.
then you will cross the Neajlov and, from the other side, you'll strike the Wallachian army on the side.
we'll do the same on the left side, with Rumelia's armies, led by Hassan Pasha.
the bridge will be under attack by the Janissaries and Spahis.
get going!
the first round was a child's trap, plotted by Sinan.
the true battle begins now.
you'll fight too now, brothers! I call the Stone troops!
let's go!
the Wallachian engaged all his forces in battle.
now's the time for Hassan and Mustafa to attack.
you'll enter the battle and not give in one step.
Where's Hassan? Where's Mustafa? I'll cut their heads off!
Mustafa! Charge!
fall back! You'll go back in order!
in order!
we lost. Let's fall back!
what? We came and saw everything, and now you want us to flea?
I won't do this. - It's an order.
I won't listen to such orders. Come with me!
your Spahi seized their cannons.
Where's that stupid Hassan?
this wretched swamp! We're lost.
let's go round it!
what would you do, if you were me?
do you think I'm too old to fight?
you're the one who's helpless, you with your damaged hand!
it's our turn.
listen carefully!
we can still beat them.
brothers Buzesti... And you! You will attack on the centre.
I'll come on the shore, towards the bridge.
and you, Cocea...
there's a hard time ahead of you.
all I ask of you is follow me! Don't you forget!
it's better to have an enemy in the ground, than in our country!
follow me!
what?
your Grace... The Wallachian leads new troops.
they attacked us from one side at the bridge.
shut up, you fool!
it's his last breath! Fight on!
fire!
he had less than 300 horsemen. Charge!
what is this? - They went to our camp.
we're lost! - Call the retreat!
don't run away! Wait!
the Turks are running away! Don't give it up!
fight, you brothers!
follow me!
charge!
Sinan Pasha!
Sinan Pasha!
Sinan!
victory!
victory!
help me, Selim!
can I do it, with this damaged hand?
or should I save the sultan's flag?
I promise you anything, if you save me!
don't stand there! Help me!
victory!
victory!
your Highness, I gathered the wounded.
all is ready. There's a wounded Turk who wants to speak to you.
Hassan?
my name's Ionica, milord. It will be until I die.
let me be your faithful servant!
take care of his foot and treat him with honour!
from now on, I want to see him at my side. Let's go!
so many dead, milord... Too many!
I know.
the Romanians will never forget this battle.
nor will our enemies.
