I say we shoot this out.
Fi, these guys have machine guns. Sam would get killed.
well, Sam will be killed for sure when that circuit cutter doesn't work.
she's right, Mike. There's no way of turning off the alarms from the outside.
then we'll do it from the inside.
do you think the two security guards might have something to say about that?
I guess we'll find out.
spies love buildings with assigned parking spaces.
if you need to talk your way past security, they give you the name of the company's employees, their positions, and even how powerful they are, all with just a stroll through the parking lot.
Hello! - Building's closed on Saturdays.
Yeah, I know. We actually work here.
I'm Don Sterling on the third floor.
I lost my wallet, and Roger here demagnetized his key.
cellphone. - I'm sorry. I can't let you guys in.
we understand you got a job to do. We totally respect that
we have this huge presentation for an FDA bigwig on Monday.
we're a little behind the eight ball.
look, I wish I could help you guys out.
if you want to talk to my supervisor, I could give you his number.
I get it -- I totally understand.
you are such an idiot! Don, this is all your fault.
I'm an idiot? My fault?
if you hadn't been drinking your lunch out of a Martini glass all week, we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place.
that's rich coming from "Roger Dodger,"
who's been dead weight since day one!
What'd you call me? - "Dead weight"!
dead weight? I'm dead weight? I'm dead weight?
dead weight, day one!
Hey, break it up!
Hey! Break it up! Break it up! Break it up!
look, we're not gonna hurt you, but we need you to take us to the control room now.
find it yourself. - Seriously.
they're here. We need to turn off those alarms now.
okay. Frick and Frack are gonna make us do this the hard way.
the schematics to their security system.
now, the main chip to the keypad is here, six inches back from the wall. You think you can handle that?
does a black hole suck?
okay, Professor, show me what that bad boy can do.
is there a whiff of a plan here, or is this like a wait-and-die kind of situation?
just keep it together. I saw Fi's car on the way in.
we just got to buy them time to figure something out.
grab the keys.
see that light there? That means the alarm is armed. Turn it off.
no problemo. Just realize it takes about a minute and a half to calibrate.
Yeah, whatever. Just hurry up -- we can't stand here all day.
and we can't rush this, either.
it's not like I'm programming a coffee maker.
so, please stand by. Schematics, please?
come on, guys. Please, tell me which key it is.
we're trying to save a man's life here -- two, if it matters.
go to hell.
look, I get it -- you hate us.
more to the left.
and... Ah! Too far.
you know what I think?
I think you're trying to rip me off by selling me this piece of crap.
do you know that every time you distract me, you slow me down?
do you realize that? So, let me just do my work, please.
move!
time's up, Professor.
I said do it -- now.
there we go. Turned it off -- just like I said.
alarm free
that was un-fun.
well, Thorne, it has been fun. But we're gonna wrap it up.
Yeah, we're not wrapping anything up just yet.
I mean, your buddy here did such a bang-up job,
I'm gonna need him tomorrow, too.
you want him on the heist?!
what are you, high? That's not part of the deal.
Schmidt, buddy, I thought you went the extra mile for your clients?
I'll tell you what
I'll throw in an extra $100k as a bonus.
uh, look. Thanks, but no thanks.
come on, I'm a scientist, not a master thief.
so, if you can just take us home.
you go home after you do the job, or you don't go home at all, Professor.
let's go.
like terrorists, organized criminals, tend to be cautious about the people they work with right before a major operation.
they watch you when you eat, post someone outside the door when you go to the bathroom, and force you to sleep under lock and key.
that is, assuming you can sleep.
Jesus. What the hell are you doing?
look, every time I close my eyes,
I-I see bullets flying and blood and entrails and
okay, just stop.
I don't know how you can just lie there, slumbering away, knowing that tomorrow we're helping a psychopath with a heist with a piece of equipment that does not work.
okay, look, the bug in the cutter doohickey is still on, so once Mike hears what those jokers are up to, he'll come back and save us.
yeah,'cause everything he's touched has come up aces.
you watch it. Shut up and go to sleep.
the last thing we need is to be stumbling around like a couple of zombies tomorrow.
do you mind if we trade cots?
go to sleep, Schmidt.
up, ladies. Game time.
all right, listen up. I just heard from my guy.
turns out the trade show is much bigger than we thought.
the Miami Gem Center is holding -- and wait for it
$90 million worth of stones in their vaults.
now, so far, all the guard shift changes are are happening as scheduled.
what are you doing?
well, it sounds like you've got a busy day planned.
I mean, you want to make sure this puppy is charged, right?
we go at 7: 00 a. m.
Joey, you park the car here on 27th. We set up here.
guys. - Nick, you cut through the east gate...
guys, Sam's back online. - ...on my command.
Greg, Tommy, and I rush in and settle the guards.
now, the only thing standing between us and early retirement is a couple of $10-an-hour corpses.
but that all depends on you, Professor.
there's a Miami P. D. station a half a mile away.
you don't kill those alarms, cops show up under 30 seconds.
that's 28 seconds longer than you'll live.
well, I sure appreciate the pep talk, but I got a bone to pick with your plan.
what's that? - The east wall in the gem center is a nightmare.
you got your PBX switch, you got your HVAC controls
这些都已经在这里了。
so, yes, I can kill the alarm, but there's no guarantee that I won't set off the fire sprinklers at the same time.
so, what are you saying?
well, I'm saying that the service entrance would be a hell of a lot easier to break into.
here?
that means we'd have to walk all the way around the block with the gear, genius.
you want your jewels? You want to get in and out clean?
trust me -- it'll be worth it.
get me there at 7: 00, you'll be cutting through that door at 7: 05 on the button.
okay. We do it your way.
just make sure it goes quick.
Yeah, speaking of which, we want our cash in the van.
not that I don't appreciate your honesty, but we go our separate ways when the job is over.
you think I'm gonna stiff you?
well, you did change the deal on us once.
y-you did kidnap us at gunpoint.
you shut up. - Okay.
fine. The money will be in the van. Let's grab our gear and move.
did he just -- - he just called our play.
look. The back side of the gem center is over here, out of sight from where they'll park the getaway van.
the van that Sam just made sure would be stuffed with cash.
Sam, you brilliant son of a bitch.
I'll never admit that I said that.
whether you're a spy or a thief, the first priority in assaulting a building is remaining concealed.
if you hit the building early on a Sunday morning, you won't have traffic or pedestrians to worry about.
and if you arrive dressed as a state-contracted cleaning crew, anyone who does see you won't give you a second look.
your nest egg will be here with your buddy when we get back.
Hey, Steve, if Schmidt even looks at you sideways, you shoot him.
let's move.
looks like they only left the driver in the van.
Yeah, I count four on team heist.
judging by those big-ass bags, I'd say they're loaded for bear.
Fi, you need to be in place by 7: 05.
the timing will have to be perfect.
I'll be fine. - Take care of yourself.
you, too.
Yes, and I will also take care of myself.
the best way to engage your enemy isn't always with a gun in your hand.
Hey, buddy. How about a car wash, huh?
come off as harmless and weak, and you can get close to your target without him getting suspicious.
come on, I got kids. Hey, man, I said stop it. All right? Hey!
and that's when you strike.
th-that was like ninja-warrior stuff, man.
you're welcome.
grab the cash. - Is he dead?
no, but you'll be if you don't hurry up and move! Sorry.
okay, Professor, let her rip.
system is complete
come on, already.
okay, that should do it.
you sure? - Yeah, go ahead. Open the door.
you'll hear the sweet sound of nothing.
let me just, uh, pack this up.
for an operative, smuggling a gun into a mission is only half the battle.
the real trick is getting to it when you need it.
it's not the kind of thing where you get a second chance, so when you make your move, you better make it count.
does that sound like nothing to you?
drop the gun! That goes for all of you.
drop it right down. Turn around.
back up. Let's go. Straight back. Let's go.
same with you. Gun in the water. Let's go!
do it, or I put one in his head. Hurry up!
come on, move it!! Let's go!
back to the wall. Face the wall.
you really think you can rip me off?
I'm not ripping anybody off, Thorne.
that circuit cutter is yours to keep, so consider our transaction complete.
have a good one.
what are you doing? Get back to the van! Let's go!
what the hell? No!
on your knees! Hands on your head now.
get on the ground!
son of a bitch.
okay. I talked to my guy.
he will be able to get you to Buenos Aires.
just waiting on the passports, but it's all taken care of.
I'd say that calls for a toast.
Yeah, none for me. - None for you?
weren't you the one singing love ballads to this Tequila at your warehouse?
Oh, well, thank you for offering me my own alcohol.
that's -- that's generous, but I'm not in the mood.
Oh, come on, pal. Lighten up -- one little pop.
one thing that I'm not to you or you or any of your ilk is a pal.
Ouch.
Hey, Schmidt, you know what I was just thinking about?
remember that one time when we saved your life?
Oh, yeah, I do. Oh, you know what?
that doesn't count when you're the guys who almost got me killed.
you destroyed my warehouse. I'm ripping off my clients. You guys ruined me.
and you know what I call people who do that?
I call them enemies. That's what I call them.
well, for what it's worth, we're the kind of enemies who won't forget what you did for us.
Yeah. The kind of enemies you can call on anytime.
seriously, man. Thank you.
okay, fine. I'll do -- I'll do your dumb toast, but only because I cannot wait for all of you to get the hell out of my country.
well, we'll take it.
here's to seeing the world.
may the skin of your bum never cover a drum.
right.
leaving signals in public is a time-honored way for spies to communicate in the field.
it's reliable and easy, but the downside is you have to check for messages on a constant basis.
Michael, the bench -- green "X.
and if you see one, you have to hurry to a rally point as fast as you can...
...and hope that it's not too late.
mom, is everything all right? We saw the signal.
no. Everything isn't all right.
what happened? Did the transfers
no, no, the transfers are fine. But Riley has Barry.
and she knows I'm the one who put him up to it.
can she prove ?
she has DNA -- something. I don't know.
she's coming after me now.
I'm so sorry, mom. - It doesn't matter.
I'm really, really sorry.
it's all right. You're doing the best you can, honey.
I'll find a place to live. I've got, um...
I've got a friend from high school.
I mean, I haven't... talked to her in years, but I could probably stay there.
Madeline, you can't stay in Miami.
well, what am I supposed to do?!
you'll come with us.
we're already having cover I. D.s made. We'll make one more.
Michael, do I look like somebody who's ready for a life on the run?
please, Mom. I need you to do this.
Why?
cause I promised Sam I would make this right, and I can't do that with you in prison.
because you're the only family I have left.
well, I'm not going anywhere cold.
I mean it. - Deal.
my name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
that's how we do it, people.
bottom line, as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
it's a deep cover job.
going after the leader of a terrorist network based in the Dominican Republic, Randall Burke.
those satellite uplinks you told me that Burke was stealing? Guess who he's selling 'em to?
rafael Serano, international terrorist.
so how do you want to do it? - I don't want your money.
I just want you. You have information that's valuable to people I work for.
go!
I just found out you have a boss.
Burke, you're part of an organization. Am I part of it?
or am I some tool you use and throw away?
all will be revealed in time.
are you in place? - Yeah. Are we a go?
we're a go.
I know you don't like this operation, Michael.
just remember, Serano hasn't given us much choice.
Burke, we can break him. Just keep interrogating him. It'll take time.
time we don't have. This has to happen now.
are you ready, Michael?
are you ready?
I'll do what I have to do. - Good.
keep your radio live. Remember, I'm counting on you. We all are.
Hello, Serano.
gonna do this again?
I told you, I have nothing to say.
the same as yesterday and the days before and every time you've been in this room!
Yeah, well...
you can make this all stop just by answering my one question.
six months ago, you're in Haiti doing an arms deal with a Turkish national.
you're wasting your time!
you receive information about a woman in the area that's wanted by Russian intelligence. And you tell the Russians her location. Yes! In exchange for $2 million. Yes!
tell me where they're holding her.
why don't you kill me now?
I'm not gonna tell you anything. The same as every other day.
I think today might be a little different.
what's this? - Just keep watching.
when you work undercover, the first question you have to ask yourself is how far you're willing to go to accomplish the mission.
Oh, no, no.
Oh, no. No, no.
that's your daughter.
the trick is to make the people you're working for believe that those lines don't exist, that you're willing to do absolutely anything for them no matter how horrible.
tell me what I want to know.
you have no idea what these Russians will do if I say anything.
your biggest problem isn't the Russians right now. It's me.
please, no. Please.
I'm gonna make a call to the gentleman in your daughter's bedroom.
you're gonna get to watch the results of that call on that screen.
the bitch is in Cuba! Cuba!
some black site off Havana!
it's a factory down by the south port. That's all I know! I swear!
it's okay.
it's okay, amigo.
you made the right choice.
Hey.
what about my daughter?
we're not gonna hurt your daughter. No, she'll be okay.
these Russians... They'll go after my family.
you're right.
the Russians are gonna want to punish you, but only as long as you're still alive.
you got a cigarette?
the only way to get through a mission like that is to remind yourself that to stop a monster, sometimes you have to pretend to be one.
this mission is getting out of control.
strong, you need to talk to your people at the CIA, make them understand I can't do this.
Michael, calm down. I know you're upset.
upset? Burke almost had me kill a child.
but you didn't. - This time.
now he wants me to pull Sam and Jesse in for a job in Cuba, - and I can't do it. - You can't? You have to.
you know as well as I do that it's not just your ass on the line if this mission goes south.
Michael, do you understand?
Yeah. - Good.
thanks for coming, Sam.
Yeah, not loving these last-minute trips, Mike.
two-hour notice to get to Cuba, to bust somebody out of a Russian black site?
that's the plan. - And Burke won't say who we're breaking out?
it's a woman. That's all I know.
well, she must be pretty damn important.
in case you hadn't noticed, we're not exactly on friendly soil.
we get caught here, we're staring at the wrong end of a firing squad.
look, Mike, Jesse and I will back you up, but tell me there's an endgame here.
when do we get to take the son of a bitch down?
as soon as I find out who Burke is working for.
this is much bigger than just one guy, Sam.
great. Let me guess. Strong and the CIA brass want you to find out how much bigger?
this doesn't end until I do.
Burke went to a lot of trouble to track this woman down.
she could be the key to what his group is up to.
guess we better get at it then.
so the Russians are hiding their black sites in refrigerator repair shops now?
it's been closed down for a few years.
they moved in, put guards on the roof, and turned it into a secret prison.
what can you say about the security situation?
not much. There's only one way in or out.
at any given time, there's a half-dozen guards up on the roof.
steel-reinforced front doors and a whole lotta cameras.
Yeah, no kidding. And the target? - Sonya Lebedenko.
she's gonna be in a holding cell somewhere in that building.
who is she?
she's a girl in a holding cell somewhere inside the building. That's all you need to know.
all righty then. Do we have any intel on...
what lies between her cell and the front door and how we're gonna get past it?
that's what you're here to figure out, Jesse.
appreciate the vote of confidence, but just look at the place.
even if we make it in there, I don't see a way to get this Sonya back out.
you know, that's a good point, Sam. But here's the deal.
either you figure out a plan to get her out quick or I'll find someone else who will.
don't worry. We'll come up with something.
okay, Mike, it's official. You've gone crazy.
I can't have Burke... - This is impossible!
bringing in other people in on this.
my entire mission at the CIA is riding on this!
well, it's not gonna mean much if we all get pumped full of lead, Mike.
and there's a good chance of that happening if we go in there guns a-blazing. You know I'm right.
well, maybe... We don't go in.
maybe we get them to bring her out. - What are you talking about?
if I can convince the Russians that the CIA is about to raid their site, they'll evacuate with Sonya.
it'll be a lot easier to grab her if they're on the move.
well, what makes you think they're gonna bite on your approach?
I just spent nine months in a Dominican hellhole convincing the world the CIA hates me.
it's not a stretch to say I'd turn on them.
Mike, that's all well and good, but these are the Russians that we're talking about.
last I checked, they hate you.
besides, you won't even be able to explain why you know where their black site is.
I'll say I have a source I can't reveal.
and when they start to torture you, what will you tell them then?
I don't know what else to do, Sam! - Guys! Guys! I have an idea.
back in my CIFA days, I knew a guy at the Russian consulate in Miami--Ivan Gorev.
he's the G. R.U.'s deputy chief. He used to harass dissidents, steal corporate secrets, stuff like that.
Yeah, but so what? How does a guy 200 miles away solve our problem?
we get someone in Miami to grab this guy, make it look like he's spying for the U. S.
then Mike goes in, tells 'em about a traitor in their ranks.
they might buy the story.
that could work. Now this, uh, someone in Miami...
any ideas?
I'll call Fi.
Hello? - It's me.
well, I assume you're not calling to catch up.
Fi, I need your help.
Michael, I have spent the last year trying to put my life back together.
what was left of it. Now things are good.
I-I can't drop everything when you call.
not anymore. - You're right. And I'm sorry I...
Michael, look. - Let me finish, please.
I'm sorry I made a promise that things were gonna change and then I broke that promise. You deserve better.
I'm glad you have that now.
what do you need?
it shouldn't be too long. The consulate opens at 9: 00.
don't worry about me. It's my first kidnapping.
I'm not exactly in a hurry to start.
well, just follow my lead.
these things are usually much easier than they sound.
nice try, honey.
you know I don't mind lending a hand when it comes to these jobs.
but wouldn't Carlos have been a better choice?
well, I couldn't tell him what I was doing.
you know, it's none of my business, but keeping secrets is not really great for a relationship.
especially a secret like this.
talking to him about it would've been too hard.
Fi, why are you doing this? - I wish I knew.
there's Ivan.
doesn't look like much of a spy, does he?
well, he's more of a pencil-pusher.
but from what I hear, he's done his fair share of damage. You stay sharp.
uh, sir? Hi.
you know, my mother and I are delivering some boxes to a friend of hers, and she's not home.
could you help us? - No, sorry. I'm late for work.
it'll just take a couple seconds. - Yes, but I have a very busy day. I can't.
well, then I suggest you make time.
when you're planning to smuggle a listening device into a facility where you know you'll be searched, choosing where to hide it can be a life-or-death decision.
not only do you want to conceal it in a place where no one will think to look...
okay, brother, you ready?
but also in a place no one will want to look.
okay, that looks sufficiently gross.
okay, Burke, we're ready over here. - Let's see if it works.
transmitting. Transmitting.
loud and clear.
all right, we're on the move.
let's get this place set up. Okay, Mikey.
go make some new friends.
open the door!
repair shop is closed.
I know this isn't a repair shop, comrade.
I need to talk to your boss.
who are you?
make any sudden moves...
we shoot.
whoever the senior GRU agent is, I must speak to him.
you understand?
when an undercover cop wears a wire, it's often more for safety than for intelligence gathering.
if the Op goes bad, his support team can pull him out.
for a spy wearing a wire, those priorities are reversed.
what matters is the intelligence.
if the Op goes bad, your support team just listens to you die.
it's urgent I speak to him.
it's urgent...
it's urgent! This is urgent!
michael Westen, I must say!
is very big honor.
it's not every day that such a famous spy shows up, gives me a chance to practice my English.
I am Vladimir Duboff, G. R.U. Tell me, what can I do for you?
glad you asked. I need protection.
protection?
you came here for protection? Maybe you're not as clever as they say.
my men are already competing for honor of putting bullet in your head.
why would I protect you?
I'm not on the greatest terms with the CIA. Maybe you've heard?
Yeah, they say you had a disagreement with a senior officer. And shot him.
Yeah, and they've been hunting me ever since.
unfortunately, I got spotted by a CIA team in the middle of Havana yesterday.
caught a bullet fragment trying to get away.
a CIA team... In Havana?
Yeah, I couldn't believe it either.
so I looked into it, find out they're going to raid this place.
so, old enemy, meet new friend. I help you, you help me?
the CIA attack here? Mm, no, no.
this is impossible. - It's not just possible, it is happening.
I have a source who told me they're after some prisoner you have here. A girl. Sonya?
does that ring a bell? I'll take that as a yes. Listen to me.
Vladimir, I can help you. You get this girl, we slip out of here quietly, just the three of us, and my source can get us a safe route.
enough! This is a lie!
this is impossible. There is no way the CIA knows about these things!
well, then explain how I walked up and knocked on your front door!
you have a leak. A G. R.U. guy at the consulate in Miami.
check it out if you want. I'm telling you the truth.
we will find out what is the truth.
the trick to making someone look like a spy is to strike just the right balance between tradecraft that's good enough to be convincing but bad enough to be detected.
one of the easiest techniques makes use of cell phone GPS.
if you know the phone is monitored you can lay down a digital trail all over town, and it will lead straight to your target.
you really think the Russians are tracking this thing?
well, if they haven't yet, they will be.
which is why I need to make it look like Ivan left this bag of documents behind for his contact.
I'm gonna dump it in that trash can over there.
if he tries anything, shoot him.
water, please.
water.
water? - Yeah.
you stay quiet, you understand?
why are you doing this? If G. R.U. believes I am traitor, they will kill me.
I'm sorry. We're helping someone.
but there must be another way.
please. I have connections. Whatever it is you need
I'm sorry. I don't believe there is another way.
damn it!
I hope you've had your fill of water today, 'cause it's the last you're gonna get.
that's right.
I do not like to do this to you.
tell me why it is you're really here, who sent you, and we stop.
I don't like you doing this to me either! And I told you!
the CIA, they're going to raid this place.
that is a lie. This is the most secret Russian facility in the Republic of Cuba!
the CIA does not- I told you! There's a source in Miami!
do you think we tell someone in Miami consulate about this place?
No! Whatever game it is you are playing, it is time to stop.
time to tell me the truth!
I am telling the truth, I swear.
you have to get your prisoner out of here.
again.
bad news from Miami?
I do not understand it. A G. R.U. agent went missing, leaving behind documents with information about this location.
it doesn't make sense!
this G. R.U. agent, he's never been here.
he's nothing, he's nobody!
that's what a good agent will make you think, wouldn't he?
he made calls to a hotel near the revolution Plaza.
that's very close to where the CIA took a shot at me.
if you hurry, you can send a team over there, you might catch a bunch of commandos ordering room service.
and when you're done, maybe you can untie me and we get the hell out of here!
get me an operations team. NOW!
they took the bait. You've got a car full of G. R.U. agents headed your way.
ready?
as ready as we can be for a car full of G. R.U. agents.
just make it look convincing. - Yeah, we're on it, man.
the place looks like an abandoned CIA headquarters.
don't mess this up. We're not gonna get another chance.
you're welcome, man.
he says the G. R.U.'S rolling this way.
figure we got about 15 minutes if they don't hit traffic.
okay, let's get cracking.
standard protocol for leaving a covert base is to destroy anything of intelligence value.
computer hard drives are smashed.
documents are shredded or burned.
bottom line: If you need to convince someone they found an abandoned CIA operations center, you've got to make a serious mess.
but, of course... None of that will do much good if you get caught making that mess.
Oh, crap. Sam, we got trouble. - What?
you said the Russian bastards wouldn't be here for 15 minutes.
it's not the Russian bastards, it's the Cuban bastards.
G. R.U. must have called the cops for backup.
well, there goes our way out. - No, duh.
we gotta find another way out of this place.
well, you got any ideas? 'Cause all I see is a door that leads to a very long stay in a Cuban prison or a window that leads to a very long drop to the concrete.
maybe not. Check it out.
Oh, I don't like this idea. - You got a better one?
just 'cause I got nothing better, doesn't make your idea good.
police... open the door.
do you see them?
no... they're gone.
water?
but not too much...
thanks anyway.
leave us alone.
did your men find the team?
they were at the hotel, but they escaped.
my men are gathering whatever intelligence is left from the site now.
they will bring it here, and you will help us to evaluate.
you want to go over documents? Vladimir, we need to leave now.
I increased the number of the guards. We are safe.
safe. Is that a joke? The is the least safe place in all of Cuba.
somewhere in here is a traitor, maybe more than one.
traitor? There is no traitor.
how many CIA documents were shredded? How many computers were destroyed?
all of them! The CIA team must have seen my men drive up
Vladimir, think. If they destroyed everything, they must have started before your men arrived.
how could they have done that if they weren't tipped off?
all of the men here... were checked personally by me.
then I suggest you check them again, because somebody in here is selling you out.
I think I tore a ligament or something on top of that stupid bus.
God, will you stop complaining about that? - Not complaining, it just hurts.
right, that's called complaining. - That's what complaining is.
tell you what, next time we'll wait around for a bus with a giant pillow on top of it. How does that sound?
Yeah, very funny. You're not the one walking halfway across Havana on a busted ankle.
hang on.
Oh, here we go. Yeah? - Where are you?
we're in the old town area taking side streets.
look, we should be to you-- - No, check that.
vladimir still isn't sold.
michael just told him he has a traitor in his operation.
so... We need to find one.
what? How the hell are we supposed to do that?
the Russians still have agents back at the hotel, right?
you gotta grab one. Make it look like he betrayed his team and ran off.
Oh, is that all? Just go back to the hotel and kidnap a G. R.U. agent?
can I remind you that we barely got out of there just now?
at this point, either Vladimir finds a traitor in his organization, or the operation fails and Michael dies.
ironically, one of the best times to go after enemies is just after they think they've beaten you.
no one expects an attack while they're still basking in the glow of victory.
okay, you ready? - Ready enough.
the key is to use the opponent's overconfidence.
the more comfortable they are that they can handle any threat, the more likely it is they'll leave themselves vulnerable.
get in there.
Ivan, I need your bank account number and your password.
what? What for?
you already made it look like I give information to CIA.
my friend just kidnapped a G. R.U. agent in Cuba, and you're going to help make it look like he's been getting payoffs.
account number, Ivan. Now.
I can't. No.
let me make this easy for you. Either you do as we ask, or I dump your ass at the Russian consulate, and they shoot you on the spot.
kill me. Just do it.
after what you have done, the whole world will think I'm traitor to my country.
you spend your time spying on dissidents and shaking down small businesses.
you know, the last I checked, it's not a big step down from corrupt spy to traitor.
fine. I give it to you.
but first, I want you to do something for me.
I want you to write a letter. To my girlfriend.
to your girlfriend? - Yes.
her name is Eva.
just write down what I say and send.
it is all I ask.
I think we can do that.
what do you wanna say?
tell her she was my life.
until I met her, I had no happiness.
I did not want to join G. R.U. as a young man, but I had no choice.
tell her I'm sorry I can't pay for school, because
school? - Eva goes to nursing school.
the money in the account was for her.
give me the account number.
I'll send 500 bucks to Cuba, and the rest I'll put into an account for Eva.
thank you.
and tell Eva...
tell her good-bye.
take off his handcuffs!
get up.
what's happening.
just come with me.
what's going on? - We found the traitor.
one of the men I sent to investigate the CIA safe house disappeared with all of the documents, all of the evidence.
you sure it's him? - Yes.
the G. R.U. agent in Miami was sending him money.
so we can get out of here now?
we will get the prisoner and go.
your CIA source, he can get us away?
Absolutely. He's at a marina outside of the city with a boat.
I just need to know you will take care of us.
this prisoner, she is top priority for Moscow.
as long as she is safe, you will be well rewarded.
Oh, believe me, we will definitely take care of her.
all right, let's go get this Sonya.
sounds like we're good to go. - Mike's working his magic.
guy's taking the girl right out and not even bringing any guards.
don't get ahead of yourself. This ain't over yet.
bring her out.
yes?
you are sure?
that is great news!
good.
leave her.
what the hell is going on? - I don't like the sound of this.
Vladimir, what are you doing? We need to go now.
no more. That was Moscow.
there's a Russian submarine offshore.
it is diverting here.
don't look so worried. You've done a good thing today.
incredible, yes?
michael Westen: The new friend of Moscow.
the CIA are en route. - Let them come!
they are sending a full commando team to protect the prisoner.
also, the interrogators, to find more traitors here.
lock the door. No one gets in!
this is bad. This place is already impossible to hit, it's about to get even more impossible.
what the hell are we gonna do?
I say we just call this off and start trying to negotiate for Mike's release.
no, we're not negotiating with anyone. We got a mission to complete.
Yeah, hey, pal, maybe you haven't been paying attention here, but this mission is toast.
Mike's trapped in there. - We're not negotiating with anyone!
we have a mission that needs to be completed.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
how's that supposed to work, huh?
you got some army around here that I'm not aware of?
even if you did, by some miracle, have an army,
I still don't see how they'd get your precious Sonya out alive.
he's got a point, Burke. This isn't looking good.
how much semtex do we have left?
about a couple pounds, maybe? Enough to get through a wall or two.
but we don't even know where they are in there.
I'll take it in myself.
okay, and how do you propose to walk in there with two pounds of high explosive?
I'll tell them I'm Michael's CIA contact.
we load the laptop full of semtex, I find them, blast us out, and you two pick us up.
Oh, that easy, huh? - No, it's not that easy.
I can't think of another plan that's that's gonna get everyone else out alive.
you're not buying it? - No, I'm not.
know this - I've never left anyone behind.
the people who work with me, the people who fight alongside me, that's my family.
I'm not gonna leave Michael behind or Sonya. No one.
if you want to see Michael alive again...
help me get him out.
will you do that?
Yeah.
Yeah, you got it.
I'm unarmed.
what do you want?
I wanna see, uh, Vladimir Duboff.
I'm a friend of Michael Westen.
wait here.
got to hand it to Burke, the guy leads from the front.
I'm not joining the Randall Burke fan club just yet.
I still don't see how this plan gets Mike and Sonya out.
guess we're about to find out.
you are Westen's CIA contact, I assume.
you assume correctly.
I owe you debt of gratitude then.
your information was extremely helpful.
then why are we still here? I've been waiting at the marina for hours.
calm down. - Calm down? You want me to
did Michael tell you about the CIA team on their way here?
Yes, he told me. - Okay.
it's not a problem.
reinforcements are coming. We are perfectly safe right here.
okay, well, that's comforting. But that only addresses half my problem.
as of today, I'm officially unemployed from the U. S.intelligence services.
I'd like to defect.
I wanna make a deal.
what exactly do you have to offer?
well, I got this agency-issued laptop, for one thing.
it's got operational platforms, agent code names, everything.
for the right price, Vladimir, any database you've ever dreamed of, I'll log you onto.
I am sure we can come to an agreement.
not so quick there, cowboy.
let me make sure Michael's fine first.
after that, we'll talk.
and you better make it quick.
once the CIA finds out I'm gone, these precious codes are gonna change.
fine. Come with me.
boy, we missed you at the marina. - Burke.
I was trying to get over there, but things took an unexpected turn.
Yeah, I'll say.
so... This is where they got you, huh?
nice. - Is for safety.
this is the most secure room in the building.
you see he's fine.
maybe he is, maybe he isn't. I'll be the judge of that.
tell you what, why don't you give us a minute? - That's unnecessary.
you want the codes to the computer, give us a minute.
thank you.
what the hell are you doing here? - Getting you out.
Really? - Yeah.
have you looked around? There's no way to get out.
well, there will be.
I'm gonna take care of the guards in the hall and breach a wall to the outside.
can you take care of the guards in here and get her out?
Yeah, I can. But how - There's no time to explain, Mike.
just understand, she is all that matters.
do you believe in me?
do you trust me?
then you need to believe in her.
she is the key to your future.
she's everything. Promise me you'll get her out.
Yeah, I promise.
it's been an honor, Mike.
okay, we're good, all set.
let's go upstairs and get this thing started.
not here! We can do it later, in my office.
Vladimir, I think it's better if you see what I have...
right now.
Jesus!
that's our cue. - All right, hang on.
drop it.
unlock it now!
where the hell are they?
where the hell is Burke? - He didn't make it.
heads up!
Ivan. A word of advice.
the G. R.U. are all over Miami looking for you, and they are very, very angry.
there's a bus to Des Moines in an hour.
I suggest you get on it and don't look back.
before I go, I must ask about Eva.
did you send the letter? - No, we did not.
Why? This was part of agreement.
well, we thought better of it.
they won't be able to find either of you if you keep your head down and use these.
they're fake I. D.s. And there's also some brochures for nursing schools in Iowa.
Wwait, is Eva- She's inside the bus station, waiting for you.
but I don't understand. Why are you doing this?
it's hard to explain. Let's just say...
we like the idea of a spy...
getting a chance to start over.
go. Before I change my mind.
Hey, so, Mike, about Burke.
sounds like he gave up his life for this Sonya.
Yeah, he did. - That's a hell of a sacrifice.
makes you wonder who she is.
he said she was the future, the key to everything.
that's it? What the hell does that mean?
I don't know. That's what we need to find out.
Yeah, Jesse? - What the hell's taking you guys so long?
we just got to the marina now. Everything all right?
other than the fact that we probably have most of the Cuban military and a submarine full of Russian commandos searching for us, everything's super.
how's Sonya?
she's still unconscious. Whatever Vladimir used to sedate her knocked her out pretty good.
it'll be a while before she wakes up.
there she is, Mike. There's our beautiful 30-foot ride back to Miami.
all right, looks like the boat's clear. We're heading back to you now.
see if you can wake Sonya.
Yeah, I'll try. Listen, you guys need to hurry up-aah!
no, no, no -wait! - Jesse. Jesse!
the line's dead. - Crap!
Jesus.
Hey, Jesse.
Hey, hey, Jesse.
Hey, buddy, can you hear me? - Yeah.
Hey, Mike, he's all right. He's breathing.
what the hell happened to you? - I got hit from behind.
she's gone. - Wait, she did this?
Oh, son of a bitch. I thought she was out, guys. I'm sorry.
Mike, what do we do now?
find her.
my name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until -
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing: No cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you:
a trigger-happy girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies. Bunch of bitchy little girls.
family too. - Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
that's how we do it, people.
bottom line, as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
it's a deep cover job. We're going after the leader of a terrorist network.
you used to work with this son of a bitch.
you're on a path, Michael. All will be revealed in time.
two hour notice to get to Cuba to bust somebody out of a Russian black site?
can you take care of the guards in here, get her out?
she is all that matters. It's been an honor, Mike.
Jesus.
Where's Mike?
she's still unconscious, but
no, no, no - Jesse?
he's all right. He's breathing.
she's gone. - Mike, what do we do now?
find her.
tracking someone in the wilderness isn't just about the occasional footprint or broken branch.
it's about using what you find to put yourself in the head of the person you're hunting.
if your target isn't completely careless, most signs you'll find will be small, almost invisible.
just a bit of disturbed earth or a bent branch.
she didn't go east. It's too dense.
with all that mud, it would lead us right to her.
this way's a bust too. She'd have to circle around to get through.
take a look at that.
of course, sometimes you do find something more obvious, which makes the trail that much easier to follow or that much harder.
okay. Now we're on to something.
okay, check it out. Looks like she fell right here.
she's getting tired. She's probably heading for the road. Come on, we can catch her.
wait. - Mike, we can't wait.
seriously, she runs like a cheetah. If she gets to the road
look at that. For two miles, we don't see a footprint.
now she leaves tracks a cub scout could follow? - What are you saying?
I'm saying I think she's hiding.
waiting to double back after we pass.
Mike, we're talking about someone who was just tortured in a black site. She's still drugged up.
I don't-- - then look at that.
the broken branch. If she went to the road, who went that way?
Oh, son of a bitch.
I think she's behind us. We should circle back.
I got a better idea. You circle back, Jesse and I keep going, - make her think she fooled us. - Sell it.
well, there we go, that branch. I think that's the right way here.
Yeah, I think she's heading for the road.
drop it, now.
Sonya, you don't wanna do this. I'm on your side.
I know who you are, Michael Westen.
take off your laces now. Make a wrong move, I'll shoot you.
that's a nice trick, sending your friends towards the road.
you don't understand. We're here to rescue you.
rescue me or take me someplace worse.
I know the Americans hate me as much as the Russians do.
I don't know what you've heard about me, but that's the past.
I no longer work for the CIA.
I was working with Randall Burke. - You worked with Randall?
he found me drinking myself to death in Santo Domingo.
he cleaned me up. He gave me a job.
we found the man who sold you to the Russians, and then we came after you.
you keep saying "we, " but I don't see Randall. Where is he?
he didn't make it out. He sacrificed himself to save you.
he's gone. I'm sorry. - He's dead?
that's convenient for you, isn't it?
my friend is dead, and the three of you can tell any story you want.
it's not a story. It's the truth. He was my friend too
he was more than a friend. He saved me.
now I don't have any proof to offer you, but I know why I'm here
because Burke gave me a purpose. He said I was part of something, that I was on a path, and I chose to believe him.
now the question is whether you choose to believe me.
Hey, Sam and Jesse. Feel like coming down to Cuba?
sure, Mike, sounds great. "Hope we get to hike through the woods. Forever.
not forever, Sam. The boat should be just up ahead.
Yeah, assuming it's still there.
we lost a lot of time on that little detour.
hold on. Looks like the Cuban police showed up.
well, I guess the good news is the boat is still there.
we just can't get to it.
we still have some C4. We could give the cops something to investigate, make it over to the seawall, and swim for the boat.
even if we get past the police, they've already called in their position.
Cuban gunships are probably headed here already.
Burke left you some clothes. We could drive up the coastline, try to get ahead of the manhunt.
it won't matter. They're going to lock down the entire island.
so I guess your proposal is to what, live in the Cuban wilderness for the rest of our lives?
there's a smuggler I know. Ruben Hernandez.
he has a cigar shop on the southern edge of Havana.
he runs guns in and out of every port in the Caribbean.
does he move people as well? - Not usually, but I can be persuasive.
okay, it looks like that place has been closed for years, so her friend could be dead or in prison
or Sonya's leading us into a trap.
I know she whacked you on the head. - No, it's not that-- I mean...
that pissed me off a little bit. I'm not gonna lie. That pissed me off.
but listen, when I was in CIFA, there was a rumor about a deep cover Russian mole working around Arlington.
blonde hair, in her 20s, spoke flawless English.
wait a minute, I heard about her. She turned the NSA inside out.
Yeah, and the information she sent home got a lot of good agents killed.
now if Sonya's that operative, it's only a matter of time before she stabs us in the back.
well, then we won't turn our backs.
Mike, you know what, maybe it's best that we just shove her in the trunk of a car - and call the CIA... - Amen to that.
cause I'll tell you one thing, the Russians didn't throw her in a black site for shoplifting.
that's not how this works, Sam. My mission isn't to grab one person, it's to take down a terrorist network, and right, now she is the only link to that network.
now if you guys want out, I understand, but I have to see this through one way or another.
no, we're in, but after this is over, Mike,
I want a thank-you note from the CIA director. And a fruit basket.
Ruben's still in business. He'll be here this afternoon.
Sam, Jesse, switch out this car before the police find it.
michael and I will wait inside.
Mike, you sure you wanna split up? Because if you guys are seen...
we'll keep a low profile. It'll be fine, Sam.
shotgun.
when you've spent too much time working with spies, trust doesn't come easy.
even when you're dealing with someone you care about, you're always on the lookout for signs of deception.
because you never know whether you're just spotting white lies...
or something darker.
what's up? - That's what I wanna know.
what are you talking about?
why did you tell Lou we'd take this job in New Orleans?
the money's not good, and the trail is two days old.
no, it's not. Lou just - Don't lie to me!
I will not be lied to.
no secrets.
fi... I-I wasn't lying about anything. Okay?
I just didn't tell you the whole story.
here's the deal. Ever since Michael came back you've had this, you know, this different look in your eye.
so I figured, I don't know, trip away for a few days might help clear your head.
that's all.
it's just when I walked up you--you hung up your phone.
I was just making hotel reservations. You wanna check my phone?
come on a trip with me.
a few days. It'll be fun.
just how much fun?
lots of fun.
well, it's just for a couple of weeks. Will you and Charlie be okay?
I'm sure, Fiona. As long as you're here for his birthday.
we're doing dinosaurs and trains.
Madeline, I'm gonna have to call you back.
I didn't see anything in your file about being a painter, but I gotta tell you, this is impressive. What do you call it?
I call it "Shoot intruders on sight."
it explores my feelings about having the CIA break into my house repeatedly.
I was expecting something a little bit more whimsical.
get out.
I'll be happy to leave, but we have to talk first.
I've heard that you're thinking about getting out of town.
Oh, you're spying on me too.
if by "spying" you mean monitoring my operative's closest known associates, then yes.
look, here's the deal. This is a very crucial point for Michael in his mission.
he's gonna need all the help he can get going forward. I need you here.
I don't care what you need. I don't wanna be involved.
you already are involved.
you kidnapped a Russian diplomat, for God's sake.
Yeah, well that was for Michael, not the CIA. And it was a one-time favor.
you know that, I know that. The people he's chasing don't.
they think that you're one of Michael's top assets in Miami. You're part of his cover now.
which means we can use you when Michael comes back to Miami.
too bad. I'm not interested. - Get interested.
this is a matter of national security.
I was hoping that you would just help us out voluntarily, but you don't really have a choice.
you let yourself in. You can let yourself out. I have a trip to shop for.
you can't just walk away from this, Ms. Glenanne.
no? Watch me.
forget about it. They're not letting even a pineapple leave the ports without inspection tonight, all right?
smuggling four people? Imposible.
you must have other avenues out of the country or other contacts.
Ruben, I want you to remember a few years back when U. S.customs somehow overlooked those shipments into San Juan.
it happened because I helped you.
if I decide to hurt you, things will go differently. Very differently.
okay, listen. There's a freighter leaving the port tonight.
the cargo's already been loaded.
if and this is a big if - Make it happen.
we might have to put that escape plan on hold. Look.
cops are here. - Those aren't just cops.
that's state security.
Oi, oi, no, no, no, no. No, not that way. If you break the window, they'll know you're here.
I have a hidden room in here.
open the door!
I'm coming. I'm coming.
just wait a minute.
good afternoon officers.
how can I help you today?
Buenas.
mind if we speak English? My Spanish is not so good.
of course, of course, uh, Seniora...
Colonel Oksana Zhirkov of the Russian GRU.
Oksana. She's been after me since I left Moscow.
we are looking for a woman you worked with a few years ago.
Sonya Lebedenko. - Sonya?
Si, Sonya, but I haven't seen Sonya in a long time.
wasn't she headed back to Russia?
no, no, no, give Ruben a chance to talk his way out of it. He's good.
this is just in case she's better.
she is in Cuba with an American. They're looking to get off the island.
given your past together, I figure this would be her first stop.
she's a clever girl. I'm sure she expected you to come to me as well and stayed away.
or perhaps they did come here without your knowledge?
they could have hidden in a crate due to be shipped out soon.
I doubt that very much because nobody comes into my warehouse without me knowing.
I trust you, senior, but do you mind if my men look around a bit?
no, no, of course not.
search the warehouse.
search the crates.
you seem nervous. - No, it's it's just the merchandise here is very valuable.
I'm sure.
tell me something. You know Sonya.
if she didn't come here, where would she go?
when she was in Havana, she, uh...
she knew this guy at Marina Tarara.
it's east of the city. A lot of pleasure yachts dock there.
do you remember the contact's name at the Marina?
eh, Eduardo. He-he would rent boats to tourists.
find anything?
nothing.
all right. You've been very helpful.
we'll be on our way.
if I hear anything I'll contact you.
but please, uh, Colonel, please take this. For you.
thank you.
one more thing, Senior Hernandez.
I noticed something interesting while we were talking.
whenever my associates walked near that wall you completely forgot about your cigar.
in fact, you held your breath.
I wonder why a weapons smuggler would have a warehouse with no weapons.
it occurs to me a hidden room would be very convenient for hiding guns or people.
or I just sent a shipment out, and for the moment I only have cigars.
lying is such hard work. And it's pointless now.
just tell me the truth, and this will all be over.
where is the hidden door?
it's the middle panel. There's a little latch on the bottom.
thank you.
they're behind the wall. I want them alive.
move.
take over!
get down!
grenade!
run!
take cover!
cover me.
go.
how's it look out there?
Oh, you know. Classic cars, good music, crumbling infrastructure.
Oh, and you two are the stars of a nationwide manhunt.
Yeah, airports sealed off. Ports are locked up tight.
even the hotels are doing room checks.
Oksana is the agency's best.
back when I knew her, an MI6 agent was made in Estonia.
he had a two-day head start to get out of the country. Oksana found and killed him by dinnertime.
there might be one card we can play.
she hasn't seen me and Jesse yet. Maybe we can approach her.
that could work. We tell her we're hunting for Mike.
pitch her on joining forces. If we can get her to show us where she's deploying her men, maybe we can find a hole.
or create one. You still have the bug we used at the black site?
Yeah, I'll just put it in my watch.
you two are going to walk into Oksana's headquarters and lie to her?
pretty much, yeah.
let me remind you, she is the head of counterintelligence for the GRU.
there's no one better at seeing through tricks like this.
I know a little bit about counterintelligence myself. - You don't know Oksana.
you make one wrong move, and she kills you and captures us.
Sonya, you saw Oksana at the warehouse yesterday. She's reading right out of your playbook.
if we just try to run, how long do you think we'll last?
sending Sam and Jesse in might be dangerous, but right now it's the best move we have.
all right, keep your heads down. Let's see what we can do.
when you're trying to escape surveillance, the first step is spotting it.
you're on the lookout for people who won't make eye contact, figures sitting in parked cars, or faces you've seen more than once.
if you can't determine how you're being watched, the best move is to change locations as soon as possible.
you all set? - Yeah.
you okay? What's wrong?
nothing, I'm just looking forward to our trip.
Yeah, me too. Let's get on the road.
of course, sometimes the reason you can't figure out how they're watching - is that they're done watching. - Fiona Glenanne, you're under arrest.
what the hell? What are you talking about? Un -under arrest for what?
two counts of criminal trespassing. 1712 Laguna Way.
What-are you kidding me? We're chasing a bail jumper, man.
we work for these guys. - No, it's not what you think.
well, it looks like your girlfriend cut some corners - No, no, no, no. Let me tell you something, okay?
I was there for that takedown. She did nothing wrong.
you want to arrest somebody, you arrest me.
I'll be happy to take you two, if that's what you want.
Carlos, you don't wanna get involved in this.
okay? - Come on.
Hey, this--this has got to be some kinda mistake, okay? It's gonna be fine, I promise.
let's go.
see ya in a bit, okay?
russia and Cuba aren't as tight as they were in the Cold War, but their law enforcement agencies still cooperate closely.
if you're looking for a Russian officer running a manhunt in Havana, there's a good chance they're operating out of a local police station.
which means the problem isn't finding them.
it's that they'll have an entire country's resources at their disposal.
hi there!
who is in charge of the manhunt?
come with us.
sorry to keep you waiting, gentlemen. I'm Colonel Oksana Zhirkov.
my men found the abandoned sedan that you reported. Thank you.
no problem.
that car's not all we can find.
my name's Chuck Finley. This is my partner, Virgil Tibbs. We're bounty hunters.
if there's money on someone's head, we track down that head.
we're currently after one Michael Westen. - I know who Michael Westen is.
good. Then you know he's on the run with someone you're after. Sonya Lebedenko?
we're thinking we team up, help each other out.
I see. Very interesting.
what other information do you have?
we're gathering information all the time.
just this morning we tracked down one of their discarded burner cells, found some of the places they've stayed.
so in other words... You have nothing.
excuse me? - You have no useful leads.
no real chance of catching them. I didn't fly in from Moscow to do your job for you.
what? No. No, no, no, that's not it at all.
see, we've been nipping at Westen's heels.
we know how he thinks. - I'm sure you do.
my associate will take down anything else you have to say.
tell Rolando to be thorough.
okay, listen, my Russian might be a little rusty, - but it sounds like you're having us worked over. - Call it what you like.
I told you this was a bad idea. Give me your phone.
have you lost your mind? You can't just lock us up!
hold on, that's my phone.
that's my phone. That could be information about Westen.
are you really gonna pass up a lead? Let the man answer his phone.
this is Virgil. Talk to me.
if you want to live, do as I say.
what do you have?
tell Oksana you're using Cuban locals to find us.
political dissidents who only talk to you.
then tell her exactly where we are.
you're serious?
it's this, or Oksana has you tortured.
thank you. Talk to you soon.
well, let's hear it. - Oh, now you wanna chat?
now she wants to chat.
I'm not saying a damn thing until your buddies back off.
you're bluffing. There's no way you found something my men didn't.
I have all the police in the region.
well, we have sources that won't talk to the police, folks who aren't fans of the current regime. Folks who are helping Westen run.
exactly. We got a whole network out there, and if you want to take advantage of it, no more goons.
we're partners on this manhunt.
fine. If you offer me something useful,
I will allow you to assist with our investigation.
okay, then. Michael and Sonya were spotted at a bodega in Miramar.
our guy followed them down the road to an abandoned bunker.
Oh, oh, uh, wow. Are you sure?
Yep. - You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure.
avenida allende. Right outside of town.
you heard him. Avenida Allende!
send all the cars in the area.
they'll be here in about five minutes.
tell me you have a way to block off this road. - I'm working on it.
if you need to create a roadblock in a hurry, the steel frames of old cars make an excellent barrier.
the challenge is moving that much metal without a tow truck.
what you need is a directed explosion.
if you make sure that the shockwave from your C4 can't head down or sideways, the only way it can go is up.
you said five minutes. - They drove fast. Let's go!
and the more contained the blast, the higher it will send a car flying.
there's no way you're gonna get the
I stand corrected.
as a spy, there's nothing better than gaining access to your enemy's war room.
you can identify their weaknesses, see where they're deploying their forces, and if you play your cards right, you can even create an escape route for your friends.
so everything else seems pretty much locked down tight, but the airport concerns me.
now look, if we double up at the VIP entrance and the employee entrance...
you might have a fighting chance there. - No.
I'm not going to play a guessing game and risk giving Sonya and Westen a clear path onto the tarmac.
the airport is secure.
okay.
uh, whoa! Whoa, are those fuel trucks?
completely unguarded? - Oh, you've seen Westen in action.
you're basically giving him a pack of matches here.
I can't devote manpower to guarding fuel trucks the entire day.
there's no way he could even reach them. - He wouldn't have to.
he could just put an old car in drive and send it in like a missile.
or... you borrow some guards from the perimeter here.
have 'em hide behind the trucks, rifles ready.
Sonya and Westen go anywhere near those trucks, it's game over.
fine, we will move some men.
three policemen off the perimeter. That doesn't help us.
planes are still heavily guarded and there's no path to them that doesn't get us cut down from three directions.
then we don't head to the planes on the tarmac.
we try to make it over to the hangar there where there's only a single guard.
I assume you know that "mantenimiento" means maintenance.
we'll find something flyable. A plane that needs a little work might be our only option right now.
and how are we going to cross that open field without the guards spotting us?
we're not. You see those cargo containers at the edge of the airfield?
we'll get 'em to come to us.
you're not going to kill him? It's risky to leave him
trust me. We'll be long gone before anyone finds him.
you know, we studied you in training.
everybody thought you were a monster.
but for somebody with so many missions your body count was abnormally low, - and there were a lot of theories about why. - Yeah, like what?
my instructor thought it was a terror tactic.
that you left people breathing to tell horror stories and spread your legend.
what did you think?
I realized that you only kill when it is absolutely necessary.
see, after a while, I could look at a diagram of one of your operations and predict who you would let live.
so your theory was that I was noble? - Or just weak.
let's go.
Glenanne. Your lawyer's here. - It's about time.
it's you.
I actually have a law degree, for what it's worth.
we need to talk, Ms. Glenanne.
I was hoping to resolve this more quickly, but you don't make things easy, do you?
I told you I'm not interested in helping you or the CIA.
and I told you you can't run away. You are either out there helping me or you are in here doing whatever it is you do in here.
I want nothing to do with him. And I want nothing to do with his mission.
well, you should. You know the deal I made with Michael.
your freedom depends on him doing - Getting exactly what he wanted in the first place.
working for the CIA.
I think maybe Michael left out a few details.
what do you mean?
this is about a lot more than him getting his old job back.
this deal... Is mission specific.
if he fails to take down this terror network you, your friends, his mother
you all go back to prison for a long, long time.
now he didn't mention that?
no.
well, maybe he wanted to protect you.
maybe he wanted to go it alone.
frankly, it doesn't matter what he wanted because he works for me, and he needs help with this thing.
when this mission is done, I want out, free and clear, no matter what Michael does.
welcome aboard.
if you have no choice but to fly a plane in need of repair, it's better to focus on what's necessary than what's ideal.
airplane technology may be complex, but the physics of flying are simple.
if you don't mind throwing away the safety manual all you need are wings, a running engine, and workable controls.
all right, this plane is getting us out of here. - This one?
looks like it's in the middle of heart surgery.
they're replacing the magnetic electric generators.
and those are for decoration? - We don't need the backup.
I can have this plane ready to fly in 30 minutes.
call the tower, try to get us clearance. - I'll see what I can do.
Hello, it's Maria. In maintenance.
I called on the 15th to get cleared for a test run on Runway 2?
rafael said it was all set.
would you please check again?
look, I just need permission for a little bit.
yes?
yo. I don't like the looks of that. - Yeah, me neither.
we just found Westen and Sonya at the airport.
what? No, no, that's impossible.
we just got a tip that they were spotted in Matanzas.
your tip is wrong. I asked the airport tower to report any unexpected activity.
they just got a request from a maintenance hangar that was supposed to be dark today.
so no one's seen him. You're basing all this on a phone call. It could have come from anyone.
then tell me why the guard closest to that hangar is missing.
they're in there. I know it.
we leave in five minutes.
she found us. They're on their way.
is the plane ready? - Close enough.
we gotta get the doors open.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
it's too late. They're already here.
they'll breach through the front and the back doors.
the moment they do, we blow a hole in the wall, we make a run for it.
it won't work. I know Oksana.
she'll bring reinforcements, and they won't breach until they have an army surrounding the place.
we need to make it to the trees. Once there, if we can get to our car, we have a chance.
I won't take that chance. - Sonya, you wanna stay here and die?
I cannot get captured again.
we wait by the barrels and when they come in, we go down fighting!
you don't understand. - No, you don't understand!
they tortured me for two solid weeks, and I held out.
I can't do it again.
and if I break we lose everything, and I won't betray my friends.
they're in a hanger at the airport.
grab your weapons. We're heading over there.
okay, the whole force is heading to the airport.
we're gonna be outnumbered by, like, 50 to 1.
hold on, I might have something. I've been listening to the radio.
no one's actually seen Mike and Sonya at the hangar yet.
maybe we can convince Oksana they're attacking this place instead.
a fake attack? - Yeah.
I like it. You think there's enough C4 left in the car?
I hope so.
buy me some time. I'm gonna go make some bad things happen.
let's go get this son of a bitch. Come on!
when you're simulating an attack on an enemy, it's more important to create fear than to do any real damage.
you can distribute your explosives for maximum effect.
you wanna use a variety of weapons to suggest multiple attackers.
and after that, all you need is a good place to hide when the action starts.
Colonel, we need to talk. - Not now. We are heading out.
this is critical. Now listen, when we approach the hangar, - Virgil and I need the helicopters in - There are no helicopters.
you're going after Westen with no eyes in the sky? The man is like a caged tiger.
you push him into a corner, he's just gonna rip our faces off.
I'm confident our faces will
what the hell was that?
Virgil! What the hell?
my partner's dead. They just killed Virgil. Oh, my God.
who? - Michael and Sonya.
they're outside the station right now. - That's not possible.
they are at the airport trapped in a hangar.
did you just see that fireball? That was my car! They just blew up my partner!
they're coming for us, and they're gonna kill us all.
no. My men have them surrounded.
your men fell for some kind of a trick.
I'm telling you, they're standing on our doorstep, and we're sitting ducks in here!
you're wrong. We need to head for the airport.
attention, attention. This is Michael Westen. I need to speak to Colonel Zhirkov.
they have one of our radios. - Yeah, I guess they do.
are you listening? I am outside with an old friend of yours.
Hello, Oksana. It's been a long time. We should catch up...
pick up the radio, Colonel. Don't make me ask again.
what the hell are you doing? Talk to the man.
this is Colonel Zhirkov. You want to talk, let's talk.
all right, that wasn't so hard.
I want your men to step outside and lay down their weapons.
I don't think you're in a position to make demands, Mr. Westen. There are two of you.
I have a police station full of men. - For now.
get over to the window, find him, and put him down.
no, no, no. He's gonna see your sniper.
do I have to pick off your men one by one like your sniper in the window? I'm done playing games!
call your men back from the airport and buy us some time until they get here.
call the commander at the airport. Send the men back here. Now!
Hello? Is anybody there?
there is no need for further bloodshed, Mr. Westen.
I'm sure we can make a deal of some sort. Just tell me what you want.
it worked. They're leaving.
what about your friend?
what do I want?
I want the bastard who tried to catch me. The one with the chin.
you see? I told you he was insane.
send him out the front door.
if he turns around, shoot him. - How can you do this to me?
I was helping you! - Let's go.
Colonel, don't hand me off to them. They'll kill me.
you told me to buy time.
guys, you don't wanna do this, believe me.
I got kids and a dog.
out. - Fine. My blood is on your hands.
Hey, nice fake attack. - Yeah, nothing to it.
all right, let's do it.
look, I promise you two, it's--it's nothing personal.
you gotta believe me. I mean, we're-- we're just doing a job.
look, if you wanna walk away, I won't stop you.
wait, wait. No. What are you doing? No, no, please! Don't--don't kill me!
no
Bravo. You're a master thespian.
let's get to the airport before the entire Cuban military shows up.
nice. That's a start. Next I want $1 million U. S.
a million U. S. ? that will take time.
you got 20 minutes. - You'll get your money.
sounds like he's keeping her busy. - Still gonna be tight. Hop in.
Yeah, and one more thing.
we need new passports. We need them now, or we unleash hell.
I'm afraid we'll be the ones unleashing hell, Mr. Westen.
we have your position completely surrounded.
if you want to negotiate, hand over Sonya, and I'll spare you.
come on, let's go!
Mr. Westen, live to fight another day.
I'll give you the money, the passports. I only want Sonya.
hand her over to me, and I'll even give you the plane.
that's quite generous, Oksana... but we already have a plane.
they're at the airport! Stop them by any means necessary.
let's go!
tray tables up. Here they come.
Yeah, uh, hey, Lou, listen.
uh, something came up, man. Just a-a slight delay.
it's nothing, all right?
uh, I gotta call you back.
Hey, what happened? They wouldn't say anything.
they wouldn't give me any information. - Well, they dropped the charges.
it's a long story.
all right, well, you'll tell me on the road? Uh, I just bought us some time with Lou.
as long as we get to New Orleans by the morning, the job's still ours.
I'll drive first.
okay. You can drive first.
I can't go, Carlos. I'm sorry.
why can't you go, Fiona?
you just said the charges were dropped.
well, our lawyer didn't get me out.
okay, so who did?
the CIA. - The CIA.
so this is about Michael.
he's on his way back to Miami, and they're forcing me to help him until the mission's over.
I thought we were moving on with our lives, Fiona. - So did I.
look, I was hoping I could put this behind me like it never happened, but it did.
wiping the slate clean's gonna take some work.
and what do you expect me to do, hmm?
sit around and wait? What about us?
I'm doing this for us!
don't say that, okay? Don't you dare say that.
I-I--look, Fiona, I don't want this. I don't want this.
Carlos. - What?
look, until I deal with my past, I-I can't be with you. I
and I really wanna be with you.
please tell me you understand.
no. I don't understand.
but I trust you.
so if you say this is what you have to do, then...
okay. I'm with you.
thank you.
you know, I didn't think air travel could be worse than my flight out of Bogota in '94.
I stand corrected. - Yeah, no joke.
I thought the wings were gonna blow off over Key Largo.
if you wanted a smoother ride you should have got us into a hangar with better planes.
I don't wanna sound high maintenance, but after squeezing into that plane
I'm gonna have to insist that we steal something with a little more leg room for the ride home.
we don't need to steal anything.
what, did you order up some limo service you didn't tell us about?
I made arrangements.
fuzzy dice.
what is this, like some kind of magic genie thing?
do I get some wishes too?
excuse me, gentlemen, I should take this.
Hello?
okay, I'll admit she didn't stab us in the back in Cuba, but she's trouble.
you swim with a shark long enough, eventually it's gonna take a chunk out of you.
Jesse, I hear you, but I don't have much choice.
Hey, at least we're back in Miami. Home field advantage.
well, that was interesting.
I just found out who exposed my identity, got me captured in the first place.
who? - Hacker syndicate. Based in Miami.
somehow they found out who I was, sold me to the highest bidder.
what now? - We destroy them, of course.
my name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing. No cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies. Bunch of bitchy little girls.
family too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
that's how we do it, people.
bottom line-- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
it's a deep cover job going after the leader of a terrorist network.
two hour notice to get to Cuba to bust somebody out of a Russian black site?
it's a woman. That's all I know.
she must be pretty damn important.
she could be the key to what his group is up to.
I want a seat at the table, Sonya.
to do what we do, you have to be willing to give up everything.
I have nothing!
my friends... They moved on.
you're the only thing I have left.
michael Allen Westen, welcome.
I am the man you've been waiting to meet.
I'll tell you whatever you want to know.
old loyalties die hard, and I need to know that you've left yours behind.
who was your training officer?
when were you recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency?
describe your relationship. A man who has no secrets can trust himself.
I told you. This one's a keeper.
I'm James.
welcome to the family.
there are few things riskier than taking down a high priority target during a meeting in a public place.
you're usually operating alone, out of radio contact, surrounded by civilians, while your support has to stay out of sight, often blocks away, so they won't be detected.
okay, everybody, this is it. Target's at the meeting with Westen at noon.
we are now at three minutes until noon. Bravo team, you got anything?
nothing yet. - Alpha team?
no sign of them. - You get stood up, sweetheart?
no, I'm just early.
the hardest part of the job is that, until the target shows up, your job is to just sit there and try to act natural.
the thing to remember is that you're not just setting a trap, you're also the bait.
all right, well, look sharp, everybody.
you see James, you see anybody who could be James, you call it in.
we're not gonna miss this son of a bitch.
you dropped your phone, hon. A customer found it.
Oh, that's not my phone.
sweetheart, I'm pretty sure it is.
sweet, little boy. Is he yours?
he's my nephew. Uh, yes, this is my phone. Thank you.
incoming Call Blocked - A little late. - I believe I'm right on time, Michael.
I thought we were gonna have a face-to-face.
don't worry. We will.
get me ears on that call now.
I'm trying, sir, but it looks like every call in the state is being routed through that tower, I can't just
get the NSA on it, then. Get me on that call!
let me guess. You're changing the venue.
there's a car waiting at the corner of Collins and 7th. It leaves in two minutes. Be there.
what if I don't make it? - You will.
Westen's moving. Keep eyes on him but don't get too close.
he's running south on 5th. - Alpha team on it.
he just cut onto Main. - I've got visual.
he's taking the stairs at Coral Plaza.
we're cut off. Rerouting now. - Don't lose him!
Bravo, where are you?
heading north on Grant, sir. I don't see him.
he just cut out of a garage onto Bayview.
I'm two blocks away. - Find him!
who's got him?
somebody tell me we have eyes on Michael Westen.
we lost him, sir. He's gone.
for a spy, the strain of a deep cover assignment goes beyond just being alone, surrounded by enemies who'd kill you if they knew your identity.
if you want to survive, you can't let any of that strain show.
you have to project total confidence, total comfort, and greet your enemies like old friends.
Michael. Welcome. How was your trip?
car, boat, helicopter, car again.
you didn't want to throw a train in for good measure?
it's not a bad idea. Talk to logistics. See what they can do.
a lot of trouble to get to-- where am I, exactly?
wherever you go, there you are. Michael.
James, I passed your little loyalty test.
why do I get the sense you still don't trust me?
you wouldn't be within 100 miles of this place if I didn't trust you.
then why keep me in the dark?
you spent your whole life in the dark working for the CIA.
I'm just turning on the lights.
come on. Lot to talk about.
nice. Very... clean.
that's true.
in my experience, all you need to get things done is the right plan, right people.
good cup of coffee doesn't hurt.
now, have you had the chance to recuperate since our last meeting?
I slept for two days.
it was a necessary unpleasantry.
I had to understand the core of you, what makes you tick.
do you know why you're here, Michael? My skills, my training.
no. Well, that's part of it, of course, but no.
because of what you've seen. What you've done.
you still have a soul.
I don't understand. - Let me ask you something.
in your career, how many times have you had to execute an action that you knew was morally wrong for the mission?
you make a deal with someone who you know is a monster because you had to follow orders?
too many times. - I was the same, once.
then one day I was done with that.
I can't fight and bleed for men without principle anymore.
that's why I've created this network...
to be the conscience, to do the right thing.
now, when we find a monster, we don't make a deal with it.
we destroy it.
is that something that you'd be interested in?
I wouldn't be within 100 miles of this place if I wasn't.
well...
there's your first monster. Marco Cabral.
he was brought up in the DR, educated in England. Came back home and got himself a job.
Sevret intelligence Services MI6
head of the Dominican Narcotics Police. - Correct.
he's also the DR's biggest drug smuggler.
he used his position to slaughter his rivals, exploit the less fortunate, take over.
and now he's arranged a deal with the Brits in exchange for his intelligence network.
he gets a very comfortable retirement in England.
I want you to get to him first.
I want you to bring him to me.
this operation has to be precise, quiet, under the radar, so you may select one person.
any resources you need will be provided. And there's one last thing.
when Burke found you in the DR, he was working on this.
I think he'd want you to finish it for him.
so...
it would be an honor.
this everything?
organized by date, going back 15 years. The pattern is clear.
good. Good work. Make sure I have hard copies of this for the trip.
strong. Any word on Mike?
no, nothing yet. Axe is on his way down to join him now.
they're doing some kind of job for James, but that's all we know.
so, what, we're just sitting on our hands?
no, Porter, actually we've been quite busy going over the financial records that Fiona and Michael stole a few weeks ago.
and we have a new lead. - Okay. What is it?
it's not what, it's who.
looks like James has a friend in Biloxi.
a mental patient. He's been paying his bills for years.
Really? Why? What's-- what's so special about the guy?
well, that's what you and Glenanne are gonna help me find out.
Yeah, I don't know if Fi's gonna be down for a last-minute CIA excursion.
I don't really care what she's down for, Porter.
both of you are getting your butts on that plane.
wheels up in four hours, and I will see you there.
okay, fine. Since you asked so nicely, I'll talk to her.
you sure you have to meet Maddie right now?
you can't just call her, say you can't make it?
she was upset, it sounded urgent.
Yeah, I get it, I get it, but we got a CIA plane waiting for us right now.
if we're late strong is gonna be pissed.
I'm more worried about what Madeline Westen will do if I blow her off.
fair enough. Just be quick, please.
Hey, Charlie.
say hi to Aunt Fiona. - Hi, Aunt Fiona.
draw grandma a cigarette. That'll be nice, honey.
I have to pick this. - Okay.
I'm gonna go talk to Aunt Fiona, all right?
okay. - I'm keeping an eye on you.
what's up? I have a pretty busy day.
Yeah, I know. Um, actually...
that's what I want to talk to you about.
your busy day.
I got a call from your boyfriend about your busy day.
Carlos called you? - Yes.
I know, this is beyond awkward, coming from me.
but he's worried, and he knows you and I are friends, and I'm the only person he had to talk to.
he says you're going out of town.
well, yeah. I told him all about it.
Jesse and I are just going to Mississippi. Business trip.
I've been around long enough to know you're lying to him.
and he knows it too. So what's really going on?
it's about the organization Michael's working to take down. It's classified.
as Michael's mother, I'm very grateful to you for helping him bring them down.
but I'm your friend too, Fiona.
and you keep doing this, you're gonna lose that young man of yours who I think you care very much about.
I know.
if I do this, I risk losing him, and if I don't...
and the mission fails, and we go to prison, I lose him anyway.
then I suggest you get on with your day.
anybody home? - Hey, Sam.
before you say another word, Mike, there's something that I gotta say.
I'm not sure if I want in on this Op.
screwing up an extradition deal run by the MI6, as in the security service of our closest ally?
they're giving a drug smuggler a comfortable retirement.
you read the file, Sam.
Cabral has killed entire families.
they may be our ally, but I'm not gonna lose sleep over this.
okay, but you do remember what the job is, right? Why we're here?
cause it ain't to take down Marco Cabral.
James is the target, Cabral is just a means to an end.
so we're clear on that. - We're clear.
so what's the plan?
Cabral is supposed to have his final sit-down with MI6 at a restaurant in his hotel.
well, can we take him there? - That's the idea, Sam.
the challenge is that James wants this done quietly and we won't have a team.
so a direct grab is out, then.
our best bet is to beat MI6 to the punch and offer Cabral a better deal.
you sure that's gonna fly? 'Cause he's been talking to our friends across the ditch for a year.
why would he jump ship now
well, that's a start.
we'll delay the British team with a fake bomb threat at the embassy.
you'll go in, make the offer, and I'll cover you from the street.
okay, and you'll cover me with...
anything you want. - That's a lot of guns, Mikey.
when operating in third-world countries, a dollar is usually a lot more useful than a bullet.
in a place where the government runs on bribes and connections, you can get a lot done with a nice suit and a bag of cash.
okay, Mike, I'm in place. Any sign of her majesty's secret service?
no. MI6 has not approached the hotel.
the lockdown at the British embassy is working.
good, it sounds like our suspicious package did its trick.
and just so you know, I'm letting your spy friends buy me the good champagne.
you know, just to help sell the cover I. D.
knock yourself out, Sam.
looks like we're good to go. Cabral is right on time.
you got me covered?
Yeah, Sam. I got a view of the entire courtyard.
senor Cabral. Welcome.
it's a pleasure to meet you.
what's going on?
where are the British-- - Oh, your British friends.
well, they've been, um, delayed.
I was hoping we'd have a little chat before they got here.
call Barton.
who are you? And how do you know about-- - About your arrangement with MI6?
well, let's just say I make it my business to know such things. I'll get right to the point.
my name is Charles Finley and I represent a major conglomerate with interest in the Caribbean.
we were told that you're looking for a fresh start, so we'd like to make an offer.
moment.
an offer, you say. - Yes, a very generous offer.
stock options, company housing, a seven-figure retainer per year, and that's just to start.
interesting. Tell me something, Mr. Finley.
what does a consortium like yours want with a man like me?
well, we're moving into this region and we need someone with influence, connections.
someone who isn't afraid to, as they say, get their hands a little bloody.
I've found that blood always washes right off.
see? Now, that's the positive attitude we're looking for.
you make big promises, Mr. Finley.
tell me why I should believe a word you say.
how about a million reasons?
and that's just the signing bonus. That's yours right now if you go with us instead of MI6.
that is very tempting. But you know what's more tempting?
I take your money...
and I go with MI6.
remember, Mr. Finley, I'm not afraid to get my hands bloody.
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you, Senor Cabral.
Oh, no? And why not?
you see, you could kill me, but then my sniper would have to kill you.
and that sounds like a bad start to a great business relationship.
well, you've got my number. When you change your mind, you give me a call.
Mike, I don't know how many times I gotta say this, but this mission is a bust.
I mean, I don't know if you were paying attention, but I was down there with a bunch of guns in my face, and Cabral was very clear,
we can't just give up, Sam.
this isn't about giving up, brother, this is about facing reality.
this guy's gonna be on a boat back to jolly old England in, what, eight hours?
which means we have eight hours to change his mind.
how do you propose to do that?
listen, Sam, there's a reason why he took this deal. Cabral has enemies.
he's already survived two assassination attempts. We can use that.
what are you thinking?
well, we know the marina where he's meeting with MI6.
if we can convince him the British can't protect him, our plan will be his only option.
Mike, I don't care how much cool crap those guys got you, we are not attacking two fully-equipped teams.
no attack. Sabotage.
sabotage the British boat, make it look like his political enemies did it.
I got a word for that: Nightmare. - It's either that or failure.
and you know as well as I do this can't fail.
Biloxi, Mississippi
Biloxi General Hospital
welcome to Biloxi. Hope you enjoyed the flight.
Yeah, not so much.
all your secret budgets, you can't spring for a bigger plane?
I've been in bumper cars with more legroom than that thing.
I'll bring it up with Congress. Here's the situation.
officially, our person of interest was transferred here for an outpatient procedure.
we'll do the interrogation in one of the surgery rooms, ship him back.
do we have a name? - You have about 50.
every time he got moved to another institute for the criminally insane he got a new file and a new I. D. For now, he's John Doe.
I'm not liking the "criminally insane" thing. Is he dangerous?
well, we have to assume he is.
he's been in isolation on a double dose of Haldol since as far back as the records go.
we've been stepping him down off the drug since this morning.
you sure that's a good idea? This guy's got a special forces tattoo.
I prefer my trained killers on the sleepy side.
Yeah, that's not gonna happen. We need him cogent and answering questions.
I'll lead the interrogation, but I want you two backing me up.
filling in any blanks with what you know about James.
code gray, code gray. Security to west wing nurse's station. Code gray.
cat scan right away and get him to radiology. - What happened? Where's John Doe?
we were escorting him to the holding room, and somehow he got out of his restraints.
we have to find him now. If he gets out of this hospital...
you need to lock this place down.
the CIA is not officially here. We order a lockdown, we could expose the entire operation.
we're not gonna catch a Special Forces operative with hospital security.
quarantine. - What?
contact the CDC, tell them there's a-- an Anthrax outbreak.
that's the only way to lock this place down.
all right, I'll make the call. You two alert security.
if you need to sabotage a boat, an explosive charge underneath the water line is usually the most efficient way to do it.
the challenge is that normal explosive devices and salt water don't mix.
remote detonators won't transmit underwater, so you need to use a timer.
the components can't get wet, so you need to make sure the device has a waterproof seal.
and once you're done comes the really hard part-- putting the device where you need it.
how we looking, Sam?
well, the MI6 guys are still sweeping the boat.
looks like they're almost done.
you sure you want to do this, Mike? Only got about ten minutes before Cabral shows.
we have to, Sam. It's our last shot.
senor Cabral. You're early. - Everything in order?
just as we discussed, yes. The boat will take you to the Cayman Islands, and from there you'll go by private plane to London.
good. Check the boat.
there's no need for that, Senor Cabral. My men have already checked everything.
senor barton, a dissident put a bomb in my home just a month ago.
another tried to assassinate me in the marketplace just a few days ago.
every second I am on this island my life is in danger.
which is all the more reason why you should depart immediately.
I will. After my men have checked it. Go.
how am I looking, Sam? - Mike, we got a problem.
Cabral's early, and he's sending his guys to the boat-- time to abort.
if we lose Cabral, we lose James.
Mike, pull the plug and get outta there. I could still do this.
Yeah, you know what? That's crazy talk.
you won't have time to plant a bomb and get a safe distance away.
an underwater explosion isn't something you want to be close to, 'cause water doesn't compress under pressure.
a shockwave carries a long distance without losing kinetic energy.
and if you're still within the blast radius when the bomb goes off, that kinetic energy will shatter every bone in your body.
your men checked the boat?
Mike, can you hear me? - You call that clear?
it was clear not ten minutes ago! I don't know what happened.
senor Cabral, unexpected complications are part of any mission.
my men are currently implementing-- - Your men almost got me killed.
we will make other arrangements. - No! There will be no more arrangements.
Mike, what the hell was that? - Did it work?
setting off a charge so close to you, you could've killed yourself.
did it work?
Yeah, Mike. It worked.
well, you're lucky that's the worst of it.
I still think we should check you out for a concussion too.
the blast pushed me into some rocks. I'm fine.
barely. - Got the job done.
maybe. There's still no guarantee that Cabral is gonna call.
meanwhile, you're out there risking your life, and for what?
you know what it's for. The CIA.
Yeah, yeah, they're gonna throw us in a hole if we don't help 'em get this James guy, but you know what?
life in a CIA prison is still better than death face-down in the middle of some God-forsaken marina on some cockamamie mission that
don't get smug.
Finley here. - Senor Finley, this is Marco Cabral.
how nice to hear from you, Mr. Cabral. How are you this lovely afternoon?
circumstances have changed. Your offer-- is it still on the table?
why, yes it is, indeed. Just tell me where you'd like to meet.
Absolutely. As soon as we can.
bought us one more hour of our quarantine, but we gotta wrap this up fast. What do we have?
well, the good news is he hasn't left the building.
we have cameras at every exit, and nothing's come in or out since the lockdown.
have we swept all the floors yet? - Well, that's the bad news.
security's combed every inch, and there's no sign of him.
what, he just disappeared? I mean, where did he go?
hold on, guys, check this out.
third floor security corridor camera picks him up going all the way down the hall.
and then poof. Kills the feed.
the only place he could've gone from there is the roof.
pull Nelson and Jacobs off E. R. - Hang on, hang on.
if this guy's hiding on the roof, why would he wait until he got all the way to the access door to kill the camera?
he's been sedated. He's not thinking straight.
or he wants us to think he's up there.
this guy with Special Forces, he knows how many people we've got.
we start pulling people off of exits, we might be giving him exactly what he wants.
but you know, last time I checked, even Deltas can't turn invisible.
he's gotta be on the roof. We've cleared the building.
there's no place else for him to go.
what about the elevator shaft?
it's right where the camera went down.
son of a bitch.
okay... We're approaching the elevator doors in the basement.
which is also the morgue, by the way--thanks for that.
anytime, Porter.
all right, people, let's look alive.
gotta open these doors at exactly the same time. I don't want this guy getting away.
all right, we're ready. Let's get this done, gentlemen.
one, two, three.
first floor, all clear. - Second floor, clear.
I think I got something.
Ah, it's a false alarm. It's not him.
Hey, Porter, I'm liking my roof idea more and more.
I'm telling you, he's still in the building, man.
how's it looking out there?
no sign of surveillance. We're all set.
Cabral said 2: 00? - Yeah.
uh, the north parking structure, 2: 00.
so I've been checking out this kidnap kit they put together for us--not bad.
I'm thinking we wait till we get out of the city before we gift wrap him.
so what is this? - Halothane. Animal sedative.
it'll keep him out cold until he gets to whatever pit James is throwing him into.
pit, huh?
he's just getting what he deserves. - Hey, I'm not friend to Cabral.
I mean, the guy almost killed me.
I'm just concerned that you're enjoying this a little too much.
enjoying this? I've been working on this job for almost a year, Sam.
that's what I'm worried about.
look, I'm your best friend. I can see that look in your eye.
this guy James-- he's getting to you. They all are.
I know.
that's why I need you here.
I know who James is. I know who Sonya is.
but it's difficult to work so hard to be part of something knowing you have to destroy it.
these people believe in what they're doing.
I'm sorry I'm putting you in this situation, but...
I don't think I can do this alone.
you don't have to, Bud.
all right. Looks like we're in business.
senor Cabral. Right on time.
pleasure to see you again.
I'm so glad we had a second chance to get acquainted.
you brought the money.
Yup, it's here, and it's all yours upon signing the employment agreement.
paperwork's in the car so you can study it in the lap of luxury on the way to the docks.
I'll take it from here, amigo.
it's okay. Is there a problem?
no. No problem. I prefer to take my own car.
we'll follow you to the boat.
if I like what I see, we have a deal.
if I don't like what I see, I have my men.
I understand the need for security.
but a parade of angry guys with guns is just gonna paint a bull's-eye on your forehead.
my men are the best on the island. They can handle any attack.
that's all well and good, but see, we're going to a private marina, so
Mr. Finley... Why are you so anxious to separate me from my men?
okay, whoa, hey. Easy, cowboy.
senor Cabral, we're both businessmen here.
put the weapons away, I'm sure we can handle this without violence.
one of the basic rules of combat is... Kill him.
hit first, and hit hard.
you only get one chance to surprise your enemy.
the important thing is to make it count.
go! Go! Go!
spies are trained extensively on what to do when taken prisoner.
if escape is impossible, the most important thing is to make a connection with your captor.
find out what they want and try to talk your way out of the situation without bloodshed.
Hey, man. My friends are outside. They're gonna be coming in here any minute.
what's that?
I'd be still if I were you.
of course, it's a lot harder to connect with someone who happens to be criminally insane.
this is ethylene oxide and perchloric acid. It's highly explosive.
and that's gonna buy us some privacy.
listen to me, you don't have to do this.
I'm afraid I do.
now I'm gonna ask you some questions, and if I don't like your answers or if I think that you're lying,
I am going to take us to hell together.
can you hear me? We want to negotiate.
just back off or I will kill him!
we're gonna have to breach. - This thing is already out of control.
we start blowing doors off of hinges, our quarantine story is shot.
well, I would rather explain a breached door than a dead body... Or two.
all right, do it.
I'm gonna need a det cord and blasting caps.
now... Is he here?
is who here?
I know who sent you, so what I want to know is he here?
I would love to answer you. I have no idea what you're talking about.
James! Where is James Kendrick?
that's his last name? Kendrick?
well, you just told me more about that guy than we've been able to find out for a month.
what?
I'm working with the CIA.
we're after the head of a terrorist network.
up until about ten seconds ago we only knew him as James.
no, you're lying. - I'm not lying, man.
you're lying. This is another one of his tricks.
see, he sent you to get rid of me, and now that I've turned the tables, you're pretending that you don't know him.
buddy, you got a bomb around my neck. I'm not trying to trick you.
I don't work for James Kendrick.
I'm here to help you.
you wanna let me in on the joke?
do you want to know why I've been rotting in a mental institution for the past 15 years?
because that bastard put me there.
when he finds out that you
wait, wait, wait, don't move! No, no, no, no, no!
no, everybody, wait! Wait!
we're all on the same team here. - Back off, or everybody dies.
Jesse, you have an improvised explosive on your chest and he has the trigger.
how are you on the same team?
listen to me. He's the victim here.
I don't think she believes you. - Oh, she does because she trusts me.
and she's my friend.
she's gonna put the gun down right now.
what about him? - That's the CIA agent I was telling you about.
wouldn't exactly call him a friend, but...
I guarantee you this, he wants to take down James just as much as you do.
he's right. I can help you.
whatever James did to you-- - He took my life away.
you help me...
and I'll do everything I can to give it back to you.
I promise.
how's Cabral doing back there?
Ah, he's sleeping like a heavily-sedated evil baby.
how much further to the rendezvous? - A few miles.
James is meeting us at a commercial marina outside Santo Domingo.
extracting a high-value target from a foreign country is a challenge even under ideal conditions.
if the capture of the target left witnesses and raised alarms, it's even harder.
the problem is that high-value targets tend to have a lot of friends and allies.
they can alert local authorities, set up search parties,
and if you're really unlucky, they can bring out some big guns of their own.
what the hell's going on up there?
Aw, crap. Looks like Cabral's DCA guys.
get out of the car, hands up!
look, can we just hightail it outta here?
no, that . 50 Cal would shred us before we even turned around.
turn off the car and come out with your hands in the air.
well, it was fun while it lasted.
Sam, wait.
wait. Wait for what? For them to kill us?
they're too far away to see into the car. There might be a way out.
what size shirt do you think he wears?
I repeat.
turn off the car and come out with your hands in the air.
okay, Mike, you got 50 feet to cover.
your hands are tied, you're wearing a head bag.
you feeling lucky?
I'll take that as a yes.
I'm sorry...
my Spanish is...
very bad.
you can have Cabral if you let me pass.
everybody wins.
OK.
send out Senor Cabral!
okay.
here he is.
good luck, brother.
walk!
try anything...
I'll kill him.
one of the oldest tricks in espionage is the false surrender of a prisoner.
it's a desperate move used only when you're completely outmanned and outgunned.
it means approaching your enemy alone and unarmed.
it's not ideal.
but it will get you close enough to attack.
kill him!
shoot him!
gotta say, Mike.
don't always enjoy these little tropical vacations, but they're never dull.
it is a pleasure to finally meet you, Mr. Axe. I've heard good things.
Yeah. Right back at you.
it was good work today.
the DR loses a murderer.
and we gain access to the largest private intelligence network in the Caribbean.
nice boat, James. A little small to fit all of us and the box.
Yes. Yes, it is.
you two won't be coming with. Tickets under these names.
safe travels, both of you.
James, I know Cabral's file backwards and forwards.
whatever you have planned for him, I can help. Take us with you.
I admire your enthusiasm, Michael.
your part in this-- it's over.
now you've proven yourself to be everything I could've hoped for and more.
go home. Get some rest. You earned it.
well, you heard the man. Let's go home.
Hey, look who's home. - Awful vacation.
you have been busy.
Yeah, with a little help from Porter and Glenanne.
you read the new file on James? - Very impressive service record.
Yeah, no kidding. Delta Force.
gotta love having our elite military training turned against us.
do we know why he went off the rails? - No. That's why you're here.
this new asset is a Delta too. Peter Millard.
same unit, disappeared at the same time.
millard refuses to tell us any more, says he wants to talk to the guy that was undercover with Kendrick.
Why? - Why don't you ask him yourself?
you the guy who's working with James?
no, I'm the one working to stop him.
what makes you think you can do that?
because I'm willing to do whatever it takes, go as far as I have to go.
as far as you have to go?
tell me, do you know how far James is willing to go?
I'm starting to. - I doubt it.
what do you know about Mogadishu? - I know you and James served together there.
according to the report, your unit was wiped out protecting a village.
he was presumed KIA, and so were you. - Is that what the report says?
why don't you tell me what really happened, then?
my unit was sent to take out a warlord outside Mogadishu.
turned out the intelligence was bad.
the warlord was a kid wannabe with a few rifles and some punk friends.
the camp was a village full of women and children. We radioed in.
guess some suit up the line didn't want a blotch on his record. Orders came down.
wipe 'em out anyway.
a lot of guys didn't like it, but orders were orders. I couldn't do it.
James was my best friend in the unit. I asked him to talk them out of it, he said he'd try.
but it didn't work? - No.
they wouldn't disobey a direct order.
I told him we had to do something, he said he'd handle it, and I thought...
God, I don't know what I thought.
what did you do?
Peter, if I'm gonna help you, I need to know what I'm facing. What did he do?
he killed them all.
the whole unit.
slit their throats while they were sleeping.
you think you can stop him? No one can stop him.
I tried. He put me away.
buried. 15 years.
I loved that man.
would've followed him anywhere.
and he led me straight to hell.
my name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing. No cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you...
a trigger-happy girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies-- bunch of bitchy little girls.
family too... - hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
that's how we do it, people.
bottom line, as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
it's not easy knowing how far to go to build trust.
last night, Sonya and I-- - Why are you telling me this, Michael?
I couldn't ask for you to be part of this operation without you knowing everything.
Michael, it's not okay to sleep with the enemy.
she is still the enemy, right?
when we find a monster, we destroy it.
there's your first monster.
this is Ben Snyder. He'll be running the Op.
snyder, get back. It's gonna blow.
she didn't make it. - Did you see her die?
a member of your team almost died today because of this man's lack of action.
he made a mistake. - He made a promise, Michael.
and promises must be kept.
tell me I'm wrong.
in the spy world, often the only things you know about a covert mission are your deployment orders and a list of equipment to bring.
sometimes, that tells you nothing.
and sometimes, it can tell a lot.
the make of your weapon tells you if you'll be in open combat or firing from the shadows.
the ammunition you're bringing can indicate whether you're there primarily to defend or to kill.
when you're leaving under cover of darkness under a false name, you can be sure that whatever the job is, it won't be pretty.
it's me, Michael. - Fi, what the hell are you doing here?
we need to talk.
do you know how dangerous it is for you to be here right now?
I was told to leave the country without contacting anyone.
relax. We're alone.
no one saw me follow you. Not even you.
good, then no one will see you leave.
I'm serious, Fi. - And this seriously can't wait.
what is it? - You know what it is.
you stood by and watched James Kendrick execute a man right before your eyes.
there was nothing I could do. - You could've stopped him!
and if I tried, I would have blown my cover, and it would have ruined everything.
this is the job.
Ah, right. The job.
that's why you've been avoiding me and Sam and Jesse ever since?
because you were doing your job?
I think it's because a part of you likes what he did.
what do you want me to do, Fi? Snyder left you to die.
I'm not gonna shed a tear for that man. How is that wrong?
because you're defending a man you're supposed to be taking down.
admit it. You are too close to this.
that's why you fit in so well with him. That's why he likes you so much.
I'm in deep cover. I'm supposed to make James like me.
it's just a cover.
not always. I know when you're faking it. I can see it in your eyes.
I'm doing everything to end this mission for you, for all of us.
you can't do that if you lose yourself along the way.
don't worry about me, Fi.
I know when to draw the line. Like you did with Sonya?
Hey. There she is.
how was your, uh-- what was it--meeting?
Yeah, business. An old acquaintance.
turned out to be a complete waste of time.
tried to call you. - Battery.
all right, well, I just
I wanted to let you know that I had to reschedule our meeting with Lou later.
Why? Is something wrong?
no, no, I have to go check on a thing for my mom. That's all.
it won't take more than an afternoon. - Your mom?
Yeah, it's probably nothing. Just some guys came by the place, asked about me.
when are you gonna go? I'll go.
no, no. My old neighborhood is not your kind of place.
well, if it's your kind of place, then it's my kind of place.
well, okay.
then you're coming.
canary Islands
whenever possible, spies like to know what their getting into before they leave for a mission.
when you ship out without orders, you can't really train or prepare.
all you can do is wait and wonder what's coming.
they're here.
have a good trip? - Yeah, it was fine.
good. Is everything here? - Yes, everything is here.
Sonya, what is the mission?
you know this man? Roger Steele?
uh, worked with him several times. He was a friend.
Michael, he's been looking into you. Into us.
well, that's his job. He's a broker between intelligence agencies, helps negotiate when things go wrong.
we intercepted this a few days ago.
he's already linked you to Randall Burke, Pablo Rios.
and now, he's looking into a new operative, a female one.
he's too close. He has to go.
well, that can't be necessary. It is necessary.
I spoke to James myself. It's top priority.
your orders are to make contact with him.
tell him you're in town and want to visit.
we go in, scout his security, and then come up with a plan.
and then?
and then, we kill him.
is this going to be a problem, Michael?
not a problem. I'll set up the meeting.
good.
no one's more careful about security than a freelance spy.
when you work in intelligence and you don't have the protection of a government, you have to assume that everyone is a potential enemy, even your closest friends.
a careful operative will have security as good as most military installations.
vehicles will be searched for explosives.
and of course, nothing that fires a bullet or sends an electronic signal makes it past the gate.
bottom line: By the time you get inside, the only thing you'll be armed with is a warm smile.
bloody hell, how long has it been? - I wanna say Prague.
2003? No, 2002.
Ah, I thought it was so long, you might have forgotten me.
what, are you kidding? I nearly fell out of my chair when you called.
it's tough to keep friends in our line of work, you know?
and who's this lovely lady? This is Ellie.
how do you do? Roger Steele. It's a pleasure.
thank you. Your home is gorgeous.
why don't you head on in and take a closer look?
Sabrina, mi Amor, why don't you take Ellie around?
sure. - Gracias, Mira.
so great to see you. Ah, we've got a lot of catching up to do. Come on in.
it's quite an upgrade from the flat in London.
business must be good. - Well, it's good enough.
bought me this lovely little slice of paradise.
Oh, blueberry was your favorite, right?
Yes. Good memory.
so what's going on? I heard you were in the D. R.for a little while.
my job to know these things, you know?
it's been rough, what, with the burn notice and the CIA
the Tom Card thing. Yes, I heard about that too.
but still, things must be good if you can visit old pals on vacation.
actually, this is not a vacation. The thing is, Roger, I need a job.
a job? Really? Well, I can make a few calls.
and there's a British oil company that's expanding its operations in Kuwait.
no civilian company's going to hire someone with my background.
I meant a job with you, on your security team.
Mike, you're putting me in a difficult situation. You know, I think the world of you, but
so what's the problem? - Michael Westen is the problem.
half my clients are terrified of you.
if they found out you're on my payroll-- - Well, then hide me in the back office.
Roger, please.
I'm--I'm desperate. - Mike, listen.
I can't give you a job.
there's no way I'm gonna leave you hanging.
I mean, it--it-- how much do you need to get back on your feet?
is 10, 000 enough? 20, 000?
I don't want a handout. - No, this is not a handout.
call it a payback for that thing in Ramadi. I won't take no for an answer.
there you are, just in time. Hello, darling.
why don't we go down to the pool and grill some steaks?
so how was the tour?
the security out here is nothing compared to what's inside.
this place is a fortress. And you?
he won't hire a spy with my baggage, not even a friend.
not gonna be able to get close to him.
well, we can't hit him inside this compound.
we'll have to do it outside.
what are you thinking?
the road in and out is narrow.
his cars are armored, so we'll have to hit hard and fast, put him down before his security can react.
unless you see another way? - No, no, no. Sounds like a plan.
and who wants some lovely champagne?
here you go. Here you go.
raise them up, you two. A toast.
to old friends.
and new ones. Slainte.
welcome to my old neighborhood. - It's charming.
Yeah, I told you you didn't have to come.
who's inside? - This guy Mateo.
I used to run with him when I was a kid. He kind of runs the neighborhood now.
but if there's something going on, he's gonna know about it.
are those your friends too? - They're with the Latin syndicate.
when you're a kid, and you grow up here, you're kind of a part of the gang whether you like it or not.
look, I'm sorry, okay, that I didn't tell you about this. I just-- I don't know.
when I got out, I never looked back. - Hey, believe me, I understand.
and so you wait in the car. I'll go talk to 'em.
Oh, you think it's safer leaving me out here?
let's go.
what you need, homey?
I'm here to see Mateo.
I think you got the wrong house.
LSG. Tell him Car-Loco's here.
Mateo, what a surprise.
who is this sexy thing? - This is my girl, Fiona.
so how you been, Mateo? - Well, you know.
we can't all leave the hood, go to college, and come back with a model chick.
but we make out all right.
Hey, come on, I still have family here. I didn't turn my back on
we're proud of you, man. You made it to the other side.
well, I appreciate that.
all right, so check it, I came down 'cause some guys rolled by my mom's house looking for me.
it sounded like there was some trouble. - Yeah, I heard about that.
what was it? - It's Nando. He knows, man.
what does he know? - He knows you snitched on him back in '03.
got him busted for that coke deal. Put him on ice for 10 years.
he got a bounty on your head.
all right, well, we're gonna get outta here. It's good seeing you.
you look good. We're gonna bounce, all right?
we gotta go.
I can't let you do that, man.
I wish you would've stayed out of the hood, papi.
I really do.
you can't do this. - Bro, I have to do this.
you got any idea what Nando would do to me if I let you go?
what he would do to my family? I'm sorry, bro.
you should've thought about that before you became a rata.
don't even try it, homey. Nando wants you alive, but he'll take you dead.
Oh, my God. Carlos!
please don't hurt him. Please, please! Oh, my God!
back off, bitch. - Listen...
I said listen to me!
drop your guns or you'll be scraping his brains off your shoes. Do it!
all right, Mateo here is gonna be walking us to our car.
you move, he dies. Questions?
Carlos, I want you to know I'm
I'm so sorry about all this.
how the hell did this happen, Detective Holloway?
Nando was supposed to be put away till 2040.
he threw money at lawyers until one of 'em found a technicality.
the American justice system at its finest.
but that still doesn't explain why he's coming after you all of a sudden.
how does a 10-year-old anonymous tip become public knowledge?
I can't prove it, but I hear Nando paid off a dirty D. A. to get access to the sealed case file.
jeez, that's the one with my name in it.
okay, so what the hell do I do now?
help us get the son of a bitch for something else, like murder.
Carlos, listen to me. Those drugs you got Nando caught with?
those were stolen from a courier from the Tenth Street gang, a courier Nando killed.
now, I know it was a long time ago, but
I remember you saying you might know someone who saw it go down.
Carlos. - I didn't mention it because I can't.
look, I spent the last decade protecting him. I cannot ask him to testify now.
Nando's only got more powerful in prison. You need him off the streets for good.
and getting this witness to testify, that's how you do it.
if that's what it takes...
all right. I'll see what I can do.
you want us to go down to Ninth and Lakewood to find this guy Lloyd, who witnessed a murder ten years ago?
you realize the cops don't even go to that neighborhood, right?
I know it's a lot to ask. But we got into a little trouble.
Yeah. Look, we show our faces in that area, we might as well turn ourselves over to Nando.
okay, so this witness you have to talk to, you can't just call the guy?
I tried, Sam, he's not answering my calls.
of course not. So he won't even talk to you, but we're supposed to go down there and get him to come with us?
and this is supposed to happen when? - Yesterday.
right. - We wouldn't be asking if it were easy.
sorry. Carlos, we got your back. Don't even worry about it, man.
you shouldn't have to pay for doing the right thing.
Jesse's right. This one's on us.
drinks are on you.
see ya.
when you're in the field, having direct contact with your control officer is supposed to be a last resort.
the risk of being seen together is enormous. If something goes wrong, people die.
if you're willing to take that risk, everyone knows it's serious.
what the hell is this? You want to meet now? In the middle of an Op?
we need to talk. This job, it's a kill mission.
I see. Who's the target? - Roger Steele. You know who that is?
Yeah, the Agency used him as a go-between on a job I did in Cyprus.
why does Kendrick want him dead? - Roger's been tracking me.
they're concerned he might figure out who I'm working with.
what am I doing here? Do you want a supportive hug?
strong, I'm supposed to be outside Roger's house in an hour, hitting him on the road as he leaves.
okay, I get it. You want me to send in a team, sweep him up, so you don't have to pull the trigger.
Yeah, something like that. - Michael, think about it.
if you're Sonya and your target suddenly vanishes, are you gonna just chalk that up to bad luck?
hell no. We grab Steele, we might as well pull you out too because this mission would be over.
you're asking me to kill a friend.
he's in the game. He knows how it's played.
and need I remind you he makes a living selling intelligence to the highest bidder.
sometimes, that intelligence gets spies killed.
and sometimes, those spies are not the bad guy.
look, when I gave you this assignment,
I said I needed the Michael Westen who was willing to do what?
whatever it takes.
this is what it takes.
we got movement at the gate. You ready?
bomb's in place. Tell me when.
they're on the road now, two SUVs. Steele's in the lead vehicle.
moving into position now.
all right. Ready to go. Arm the detonator.
armed.
both SUVs are headed your way.
now remember: Do not move un-- - Until you disable the car. I know.
roadside improvised explosive devices come in many varieties.
but they usually share basic features.
once a target vehicle is chosen, an explosive device is planted in the vehicle's path and then detonated by remote control as soon as the vehicle is in position.
of course, that assumes that your target isn't using a signal jammer.
Michael. - Sonya. Sonya, come in!
the problem with signal jammers is they don't just make it impossible to remotely trigger a detonator.
they also make it impossible to communicate with your team.
and when you can't communicate, bad things usually happen.
get in.
the guy Carlos needs to talk to lives in 4C.
not a place that takes kindly to strangers. - That's what we got the cover for, Sam.
hopefully, they'll give us a pass, since, technically, we're here to help.
how you doin', ma'am? Don't wanna scare ya.
we're with the health department. Please read that.
Hey, how are ya, sir? Check that out.
how are ya, folks? We're with the health department.
I'm sure you heard about the refinery spill over at Sunco.
some hydro carbic toxins were released.
Yeah, we just wanna make sure that no one was exposed.
how's everybody feelin'? Any rashes? Nausea? Burning eyes? Loose stool?
Nah, dude. That's nasty. - Yeah. Yeah, it is nasty.
it's nasty and it's deadly. So if you feel anything, you make sure you call us. Okay?
examine yourselves. - Have a blessed day.
Hi. Health department. Can we come in?
how come?
uh, just a quick check for toxic gas. Won't take a minute.
come on. - Thank you.
Yeah, I don't know what the problem is, but I haven't heard anything about a gas leak.
uh, well, sir, see, we're actually not with the health department.
we just had to talk to you without raising too many eyebrows in this area.
we're friends of Carlos Cruz.
what? What, wait, no. No, I told him on the phone
we know. The thing is, the guy that's coming after Carlos, he's gonna be coming after you before too long.
we wanna take you someplace safe, someplace you can talk to the cops.
no, no way. Just get out.
Lloyd, we're on your side. - I said get out! Get out!
stop fighting. Stop fighting! Stop fighting!
stop fighting. Stop.
Jesse. - What?
he stopped fighting.
crap. He's out cold.
I barely even-- what now?
everybody make way. This man has had a seizure.
read your brochures, people. - What'd I say? Serious business.
no, no way. I told you I can't.
I-I-I'm not talking to the cops.
Lloyd, you're the only one that can get Nando off the street. You have to step up.
what I gotta do is I gotta get out of town, right? Look, look, - they could be on their way here right now. - We got out of the neighborhood clean.
Sam and Jesse are keeping watch outside just in case.
you wait, you mean the two guys that-- that took me out and kidnapped me? Those two?
Lloyd, I'm sorry for how this whole thing went down.
but it's time you do the right thing. Now, I wouldn't ask you if there was any other way.
but if you stay quiet, if you do nothing, Nando will find you, eventually.
and if you run, you put your whole family in danger.
you don't understand, man. I've seen what Nando does to guys that cross him.
that's not gonna be me! - So what are you gonna do?
you gonna let him walk free? You gonna give him a free pass because you're afraid?
Carlos, can I just say something? - Please.
look, I'm sorry. You--I don't even know you.
and this is probably none of my business.
but I do know what it's like to be afraid of doing the right thing.
I've been there for years.
and, um... If you don't do this...
you're gonna spend the rest of your life knowing that the blood of every person this man hurt is on your hands.
just think about it.
it's all right.
all right. Carlos, tell your cop friend I want a deal, in writing-- protection for me and my family.
I'll make it happen.
when a plan goes wrong in the field, the job is rarely abandoned entirely.
the goals of the mission don't change. The methods do.
destroy the cell phones, anything traceable. We leave in one hour.
the problem is backup plans are usually that for a reason.
they tend to be a lot messier and a lot more deadly.
Sonya, what are you doin'? - I'm finishing our mission.
I don't know if you were paying attention back there, but we failed.
calling in an air strike. They'll hit the compound with a bomb from high altitude.
an air strike? Do you know how many people that will kill?
all the guards, all the staff
I don't like it either, Michael. But we don't get to fail.
wait. I-I have a better idea. - I don't have time for it.
Sonya, listen to me. Stop. Listen--stop!
all of those people don't have to die to kill one man.
hear me out. - I'm listening.
let me call Roger. I can finish this with a sniper rifle.
one shot, one body. Give me an hour.
fine. You have one hour.
Yes, who is this? - Roger, it's--it's Michael.
I-I-I-we need to talk. I'm in a sticky situation.
I need your help. - I don't have the time, Michael.
I've got a situation of my own.
hold on, there are some men who came after me.
men in masks, they tried to kill me on the street.
wait, black masks? - Yeah.
was it a two-man hit team packing MP5ks?
Yeah, two men-- yes, yes.
Jesus, Michael. The same guys came after me.
what? - Where are you?
I'll get my guys together. I'll be right there.
we're in an abandoned factory on Loma Vista Avenue. It's a white, two-story building.
I think the best approach is from the south.
loma Vista Avenue. Don't worry, Michael. I'll be there.
just stay alive until I do.
we'll do our best. I think we have ten minutes.
as a spy, you have to get used to deception.
your job is to engage with people, make them your friends, manipulate them, and ultimately destroy them.
it's one thing to do it to your enemies.
you can think of your target in terms that aren't exactly human, like, mission objectives.
he's here.
but when the target is a friend, it doesn't matter what you tell yourself.
it feels like betrayal.
Roger, it's Michael. - Michael, it's me. I'm here.
I'm at the south side with my men. Tell me where you are.
where are you? I don't see the team?
get in the building now. Stay with me. Go!
take the shot.
Michael, take the shot.
Michael, you still there? - I'm here, Roger.
and I'm sorry.
okay, Lloyd. Here's how this works.
Carlos is gonna meet the detective, make the deal.
then, we're gonna take you over there, okay?
you don't have to go anywhere till Carlos gives the high sign.
how's it lookin', Fi? - He just arrived.
detective Holloway too. Right on time.
okay, see? They'll sort it out.
everything's gonna be just fine.
Yeah, well, you just make sure you keep those guns ready. I'll believe it when I see it.
Hey, Detective. Thanks for coming. - Of course.
Where's my witness?
I talked to him, and he says that he'll testify, but he has conditions.
conditions? What conditions? - He wants Witness Protection.
he wants a signed agreement from the D. A. before he shows his face.
the DA? - I'm sorry, Detective.
but that's how it's gotta be. He's nervous. You understand.
everything all right, Fi? - Well, she's not thrilled.
Carlos will take care of it.
who's this?
it--it doesn't matter. The question is: Where is the witness right now?
who's that?
I don't know. Another detective, maybe?
you've gotta be kidding me.
man, I am so happy to see you. How long has it been?
Oh, yeah. Ten years. - Fi, what's happening?
I can't see. That SUV's blocking my view.
so you were the one that blew my cover.
it's nothing personal, Carlos. Just business.
you were a goddamn traitor to your ba
shut up.
Where's my witness?
he didn't-- there was a problem.
a problem? What does that mean? I don't like problems.
Fi, can you tell what the hell is goin' on?
I still can't see Carlos. Maybe we should go in.
look, we had a deal. I paid you good money to deliver me this rat and a witness.
look, I did everything I could, okay? It's not my fault he didn't show up.
it's not? Bitch, you told me you'd pull through.
watch your tone. I could still arrest your ass any day of the week.
are you threatening me? Are you threatening me?
just back off.
what the hell was that?
Nando. - That wasn't part of the deal!
get him in the car. Let's go.
they're taking Carlos. We gotta follow 'em.
I'm driving. - Oh, boy.
I don't know, guys. Well, I guess we could try taking a run at it, but
it's a gang HQ, Sam. Everybody in there is packing. We can't just go in all commando.
we might as well shoot ourselves in the head and save Nando the trouble.
I think it's cop time.
Jesse, the whole problem is that Carlos knows Nando murdered someone.
if we call the cops, he's dead for sure.
I'm not saying I like it. I just don't see another way.
it's Carlos's phone. Hello? - Is this Fiona?
Nando. - I got your number from a mutual friend.
I'm having a barbecue in his honor.
he wants to say hi.
what are you-- stop it!
you want it to stop? Oh, you can make it stop anytime.
all I want is peace of mind.
but Carlos here, he doesn't want to give it to me.
I want that witness.
so you can kill him? - Better him than Carlos.
all right! I'll get you the witness. Just give me some time.
Oh, time? You got all the time in the world.
but Carlos here, he's only got until 5: 00.
uh, Fi, did I hear you right?
it sounded like you just said you're gonna hand Lloyd over to Nando.
Nando is torturing Carlos. I'm just trying to buy us time.
we have until 5: 00. - 5: 00?
that's an hour and 20 minutes from now. What are we supposed to do in that amount of time?
I don't know, Sam!
maybe Michael does.
yeah? - It's me.
Fi? - Are you in Miami?
we just got back. What's wrong?
Carlos is in trouble. I need your help.
what can I do? - I'm not sure.
he's being held by a gangster in South Miami.
maybe Sonya, or the people she works with, or their resources?
Sonya? I could ask her, if that's really what you want.
I don't see another way. - Tell me everything I need to know.
did you talk to Sonya? - She's talking to her people.
they're working on it. - Working on it? What does that mean?
can they deal with Nando or not?
I think so. They're contacting some of their people in the drug trade.
they're gonna go above his head to his supplier.
how long is that gonna take? - I don't know.
they're gonna call me when they have something.
Michael, Carlos is running out of time.
we just need to buy a little more time. They'll come through.
well, how can you be sure? Because they owe me.
I did a job for them that
they'll come through.
okay. Practical question. How are we gonna buy Carlos more time?
he wants a witness? Let's give him one.
Mike, we don't even know where Lloyd is.
Nando's never seen him, right? - No.
take me in. I'll be the witness. We can buy ourselves some time with that.
what if they don't go for it?
then I'll have called in that favor for nothing, 'cause we'll all be dead.
Fiona Glenanne. Just in time.
you got my witness? - Yes, I do.
but I would prefer to hand him to you myself, in person.
little girl, you are in no position to make any demands.
I think I am, if you want your witness.
you see, I have a gun to his head, a head that contains all the answers to your questions.
so if you don't want your answers splattered all over the place, then let us in right now.
Carlos. Wake up.
I wanna show you something.
you put up with all that pain to protect a name.
but now, I don't need the name.
you must be Fiona. - Smart man.
you can let him go now.
we'll see about that, 'cause I think you might be trying to play me.
Nando, you asked for-- - Shut up.
so you're the pendejo who saw me cap that dude ten years ago, huh?
got to admit it's kind of funny.
seems to me somebody would've noticed a white boy like you hanging around in little Managua.
so I guess the real question is: Who the hell are you?
cause my guess is you ain't no witness.
you're right, Nando. I'm not a witness. I'm a messenger.
and this is my message. You don't know what you're up against.
you have no idea what you're up against. So I'm gonna give you some advice.
you let the three of us go now.
and when we're gone, you leave town. And when I say leave, I mean forever.
this guy! I mean, I don't know whether he's stupid, or crazy, or both?
some balls, though. Big talk from an unarmed man with a 100-pound pixie as his backup.
I have friends.
you got friends, huh? Chacho, he's got friends.
friends? Well, where are they?
because I don't see these friends of yours.
you wanna know what I think? I think you got nothing. That's what I think.
what are you laughing at, loco?
you think I would walk in here with nothing?
Nando, Nando, Nando, you're dead.
you just don't know it yet.
Chacho, shoot this fool.
you might want to answer that.
yo, who is this?
Nando, you're not gonna believe it. It's Lopez.
Cual Lopez? Lopez from-- - Colombia.
he said to put him on speaker.
Nando, forgive me for interrupting. - No, no, no, no. No--no problem.
what can I do? What's going on?
the man who owns this phone, is he there? Is he alive?
Yeah, he's fine. - Good.
listen to me carefully. You're going to let him go, him and his friends.
you understand?
Ricardo, no. I can't. Listen, you don't understand.
these guys can pin a murder on me.
I have to handle it. - Don't worry, Nando. I'll handle it.
Chacho, you know who I am?
what I can do? To your familia? To you?
Yes, sir, Mr. Lopez.
so if I asked you to do something, you would do it no matter what, right?
Yes, sir. - Ricardo, por favor.
shut up. I'm talking to Chacho.
Chacho, I want you to shoot Nando now.
what? Ricardo, por favor.
thank you, Chacho. Now, make sure your guests get home safely.
get them out of here.
I hear things worked out for Fiona and her boyfriend.
what did you do? - We put pressure on a supplier, made them understand it was in his best interest to make a call.
thank you. - Of course.
Michael, about this job with your friend Steele.
I know it wasn't easy. He was a threat. And it was necessary.
necessary for what?
for everything. Michael, don't you understand? You're part of this.
James has plans for you, big plans. - What does that mean?
you can ask him yourself. He wants to see us next week.
where? When? - I'll know the details soon.
in the meantime, why don't you get some rest? Okay?
you've earned it.
Carlos, what are you doing? - Fi, we need to talk.
Fi, I'm moving out.
I'm gonna go stay with a buddy of mine for a while.
I think it's best... For both of us.
does this have anything to do with what happened to Nando?
Yeah.
that call that Michael got, you know why that happened?
open it up. That's from a newspaper in Bogota.
cartel Compound Attacked by Helicopter
two days ago, at the exact same time Nando got the call, a helicopter gun ship opened fire on an estate outside of Cartagena.
you know who owned that estate?
ricardo Lopez, the same guy that called Nando.
seven people died, Fi.
I was-- I was trying to save you. I...
and I thank you for that.
but I'm gonna have to live with that for the rest of my life and wonder if it was all worth it.
I love you.
I love you too, Fi.
you're traveling a path with Michael.
you always have.
I can't go down it with you.
I don't have a choice.
Yes, you do.
and you've made it.
So...why the vasectomy?
I hate the rubbers what happened back there could have happened to anybody wrong place, wrong time, wrong vagina I think it's time I go have a little chat with our president.
that's it. Runkle is ankling.

I've had way grosser dudes than you staring into the business end of my cooter all day long.

but I don't know if getting paid six-figure sums to hang out with rock Stars all day really constitutes work - but, you know... - of course it does.

Oh, my god. That's -- no. Hey!

Yes.

Hey, and whatever you do, don't be another brick in the wall!
the chorus is the verse.

work it out, grasshoppers.
smoke?
Aw, no, thanks. I quit.
chorus was the verse.
Yeah. The chorus was the verse.
so you know you just...you just listened to that song one time?
I hear. I speak. I move on. That's my job.
right. So you just operate on pure instinct?
what the fuck else is there?
I don't know -- intellect, technique, for instance.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
warren Zevon could sit down and talk 12-tone theory with, uh, Stravinsky.
here barely play their fucking instruments.
yesterday the lead singer's girlfriend comes by with all these sprinkles cupcakes, and one of those little screamo fags in there pulls out this little plastic knife,cuts one in half, shares it with the other johnny cupcake.
Elton John going down on George Michael in a public washroom.
less gay.
it would've been more gay if he shoves a cupcake up the other guy's ass and then ate it out of there, but thank you for putting that in my head, you know?
because I love me some Elton John.
Oh, you love me some Elton John?
what are you -- get off of my ass.
looks like we're just in time.
uh, take - out has arrived.
how you doing? Good.
Hank Moody.
Beatrice Trixie.

uh, I seem to recall... an exchange of currency, yes.
well, cool.
then you take Trixie, I'll take Amber, unless you want to go together? No.
swap midstream? No!
no? cool.
catch you on the flip side.
Amber!
So...How's Trix?
Charlie Runkle from -- um...j-just -- just charlie Runkle.
where? f-from planet earth.
that's where I'm calling from, okay?
meanwhile, how about we just get a lunch on...the books.
nice.
Hey.
Hey, I know you. How you doing?
you -- you don't remember me?
we met at my wife's salon.
Yeah, you were having your lady needs tended to, and I was -- oh,
Marcy's dude.
Yes. Charlie Runk.
Daisy.
Daisy. That's right. Daisy. So, the lovely Daisy.
where are you off to this lovely afternoon?
you know, just work.
work? Well, that's great. That means you scored a part.
well, you're not psyched.
these guys are just total amateurs, and I hate working for them.
I ju-- I understand basic impulse to want to stick your dick in something.
like, I get that.
I'm just not one of these chicks that's down with objects.
objects? you know, like bottles of booze, cellphones, and whatnot.
uh, toys, sure.
food -- maybe. food's organic.
well, some of it is.
I mean, you really -- you got to read the labels.
but once you become that chick, you're in a box, right?
forever and ever, you're the girl that sticks stuff up there.
and I just didn't get into this business to become some kind of freak show no, no. You most certainly did not. No.
that's why you got to stand up for yourself with those people.
you got to tell them what you just told me.
Yeah, right.
like they really want to hear that from some chick just off the bus from Hicksville.
how are you gonna get what you want if you don't ask for it, huh?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do -- let me talk to them for you.
that sounds really nice, but -- I'm gonna go with you to the set.
actually, that -- I'll put in a few well-chosen words...
that sounds really great but, um... -what's up, sweetheart?
you and, uh, uncle fester need a lift?
um, look, mister, you've been really...nice, but that's actually my ride, so I have to go.
Hey, hey. not so fast.
are you going to the set? I'll come with.
how you doing, pal?
okay, shove over, make room.
one real Hollywood agent at your service.
in case they don't want to do that, I-I've prepared a couple of options.
but -- so we've got...The safe...approach, which is that.
and then we've got the more radical approach -- honey, honey.
I think you're throwing Karen off. Jesus. no, no. it's fine.
I'm the one that's intruding.
I, um, I just wanted to check in with you before we meet the client and to through，um...It's not really your forte, is it...
selling yourself?
well, I'm not selling myself.
I'm selling my works.
Hey, give me your wrist.
I don't really want to give you my wrist.
Karen? Go with it, okay?
trust me. The man knows his shit.
Oh, of course, I-I just... -give me your wrist.
Oh, my god. Here's my wrist.
thank you.
close your eyes.
close your eyes.
don't be scared.
good.
now, we all have this pressure point in our wrists right about here that reduces nervousness.
your heart is racing.
why is that?
Mm-hmm. Because you're feeling judged.
the artist within feels threatened...under attack.
now, those are very primal emotions.
you don't have to be ashamed. Now, listen to me, Karen.
I'm here to tell you -- if you're operating from a place of inner strength and conviction, anything is possible.
Yes.
and no dream that you dare to dream can be beyond your grasp.
thank you.
believe it.
Thanks.
this is totally uncool, Daisy.
what the fuck? You had to bring your boyfriend?
he is not my boyfriend.
I'm just along for the ride, fellas.
Hey, hey, where we shooting today anyway, huh?
do you know what a hassle this is?
you know what? We're just gonna have to fuzz him out.
fuzz me out of what?
listen, brother, if you want to ride in the slam van, you've got to sign a release.
I'm sorry. "the slam van"?
fuzz me out of what?!
look, I don't even understand what the problem is, all right?
I'm just -- I'm catching a ride to the set.
I'm gonna say hello once to the director.
the -- the set? This is the set.
and I -- hello -- am the director.
Oh, you're the director.
Yeah. Charlie Runkle, utk -- or formerly utk.
listen, I'm not familiar with your work, per se, all right?
but I think it's safe to say we're both big fans of Daisy, here, right?
Yeah, yeah. You know what?
I'd be an even bigger fan of Daisy if she would start schlobbing some knob.
now, Daisy, can you hurry it up, please?
we are losing daylight, sweetheart. All right, all right.
you know what? Um, fuck it.
we're just gonna put Popeye in this scene here anyway, man.
you know what? You be her daddy or something in this one.
or maybe a creepy uncle, okay?
Daisy, you're going to get some ice cream.
your car breaks down -- shit like that. Okay.
let's just start sucking. Okay.
all right. On my go!
And...action!
it was so cool of you to help me out like this.
I just wish there was some way I could...thank you.
what the f-- whoa! shit!
Uh-oh. Daddy no likey.
Daisy, what are you do-- oh, geez!
Oh, come on, little girl. Aw, fuck!
make daddy proud. little girl, make daddy proud.
okay, there you go.
see, it's your friend. It's your friend.
Uh-oh. It's getting bigger.
it's getting meaner. Fight back!
then she jumped into the car, and we drove off into the sunset.
well, no, it was -- it was actually dark already.
but you get the idea, huh?
awesome. Good for you.
Yeah, and we've been living happily ever after ever since.
pretty much.
"pretty much"?
it's a long story, but, um...
one night, I ended up becoming the accidental oralist to this very naked, very young girl.
it's been a sticking point.
I don't really know what that means, but it sounds bad.
do you want a tug job?
is that with the -- the foot?
no -- what?
a little hand release? Oh, no, thanks.
I'm not a big fan of hand work in general.
and I don't think it would be appropriate, given the story I just told you.
I was just asking. I am on the clock.
record company's dime.
not that you're not doing a great job on my toes.
I just thought I'd put it out there.
it's hardly cheating.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is.
maybe you're right.
sometimes my whore logic gets all fucked up.
but I can tell you that there's a lot of husbands and boyfriends out there who would not file that under cheating.
Yeah, well, call me an old fuddy-duddy,
but I think anytime the tumescent head makes an appearance, it's cheating.
is that good dirty talk?
like, if I said to a client, "you're so fucking tumescent right now, " would that be hot?
makes my wiener feel a little weird, but that's just me.
I like words.
how come you never called me?
if you remember, I was a little strapped for cash.
you could have called to ask me out on a proper date.
I did give you my card, didn't I?
I just figured you give it to all the fellas.
no. No?
no.
you really got under my skin, Hank Moody.
I just couldn't shake you off. Like, I'd be blowing some gross Persian dude at the whore seasons and I'd be thinking, "I wonder how Hank's doing?
fuck, that's romantic.
are you guys gonna bang or what?
what's it to you, Bo Bice?
I don't know.
I was just thinking about how rad it would be to bend you over that balcony and scream, "I' m the king of the world!" as I'm about to pop, huh?
how about in a bed with a condom?
whatever, dude.
sure about this?
all in a day's work.
Hey, man, you want to watch for your book?
Oh, hey, thanks, but I'll pass.
be good to the lady.
don't fuck up her toes.
you might not want to sit there.
Why? Have you got the herp or something?
no.
then I'm good.
look, but s-seriously. If you sit here, people are gonna think you're weird.
how unfortunate.
and here I was planning to run for prom queen.
you're weird.
at least I'm not the only boy at an all-girls school.
for your information, I don't actually go here.
I got suspended from my real school. Some bullshit I didn't even do.
and my mom was like, "there's no f'ing way you're sitting on the couch all day, playing 'guitar hero'."
she's a teacher here.
english, I presume.
uh, Mrs. patterson.
what, do you have her or something?
3rd period.
but Ethan Frome gave you away.
tsk. Right.
Yeah, she's making me read this entire stupid book. Some sort of punishment.
I'm sorry. I talk a lot.
you do.
and you forgot the most important part...
are you any good?
you know, "guitar hero."
Oh, man, I think I just found the keys to my chi.
how's Trix?
she was fantastic. She's a real dame.
we didn't do anything, though. We just hung out.
well, if I knew you were just gonna hang out, talk about your feelings and shit, I would've gone with Trixie.
I mean, she's my favorite, my best. Totally gets me.
I know you reside in a whole other solar system and shit, but in mine, I don't cheat on my girl.
ladies and gentlemen -- Hank Moody, debauched moralist.
why don't you, uh...why don't you tell me more about your girl?
what girl? You know, the one. The one that got away.
the one with the house in Beverly hills.
your Daisy Buchanan.
that's not cool, Moody, calling back that shit. I was gorked.
I don't talk about that stuff in broad daylight.
I don't know if you got the memo, but I'm writing your biography.
you might want to start getting comfortable talking about this shit in broad daylight.
this is it, Lew. I am done.
no more of you and your fucking white-trash lottery winners!
what's wrong, sweetheart?
that fucking asshole got rough with me, and he went way off the fucking menu!
what' d he do, honey? You all right?
I'm fine! luckily, he's a quick comer.
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, Trix.
they're animals. They don't know any better.
Yeah, well, someone's gonna have to deal with the cleveland steamer that he left on your coffee table.
Really? really.
Jesus!
Consuela!
Consuela!
you're a fucking prick! You know that? Thank you.
show some respect.
what, to a fucking whore? Come on.
what the fuck are you doing, Moody?!
slash traded me that Les Paul for an eightball! fuck!
get him!
I swear to god, I'll kill you!
back to work, assholes.
we're making rock history here.
act accordingly.
look how great your tits are!
celebrate them! That's it, Daisy! Moan!
moan like it hurts a little.
not like an operation, more like -- like a dentist visit.
come on, baby! Slam her, flex!
how long does this generally go on for, huh, these, uh, cinema masterpieces of yours?
asshole, shut the fuck up!
okay! okay! okay! I'll mind my business.
I'm just a passenger on the slam van.
just along for the ride.
although I got to say, Daisy, I'm a little bit surprised to see you like this.
what are you talking about? You knew I did porn.
Yes, I did,
but the girl I met back at hot lips had bigger plans for herself, huh?
she had goals, she had dreams, she had ambition.
she did not -- and I quote -- "want to end up the ass-licker.
Yeah, well, I'm not.
you see any other girls in this van?
I'm totally the star of this production.
this production is one notch above snuff film.
Hey, easy, brother.
two more payments, and I own this van.
did you negotiate before you got on this van, Daisy, huh?
did you lay clear rules for what you will and will not do? No.
then how you gonna get respect, huh?
how you gonna get paid accordingly?
what's the industry standard here, anyway?
double for anal? Am I right?
dumb shit, we're shooting in a van.
so what?
does fairness not exist in a van, huh?
just because we're not on a sound stage, does this young lady not deserve the same dignity, the same respect as someone on a sitcom or a Broadway play?
look, Mr. Runkle, it's fine, really.
no, no, no, Daisy, it is not fine.
there's a limit to how much someone can get.
fucked in the ass without getting paid for it!
and you, young lady, today, have reached that limit!
that's it! Bigs, stop the van!
what?
Ovitz! Hit the bricks! Get the fuck out!
with pleasure!
Daisy? um, I'm good.
little girl, you're going too, sweetheart.
go make your dreams come true.
but I didn't do anything!
O-u-g-h-t -- out!
she's real scared of you.
let me tell you something, Al Goldstein.
see you at the Oscars, pal.
let's go!
let's just shoot it solo, baby.
Oh, you left your -- your shirt.
no problem.
here you go.
thank you.
looks good.
where the fuck are we?
it's basic instinct, really.
when I see a girl in trouble, I just react.
I don't think. I just do.
Hank Moody, my hero.
just say the word if you want to be properly rewarded.
my treat, of course.
seriously, you'd comp him?
sure, why not? I've sampled the merchandise.
I know it's fresh.
I do remember you telling me that you never came that hard with a John before.
I thought it was a line, but as you walked away, your knees were a little wobbly, so I thought, maybe, yeah...
hold on. Slow down.
are you saying he's fucking better than me?
I believe that's what she's getting at.
no, that is not what I'm getting at.
please. What a stupid question.
fucking "a" they are.
I must agree with the man.
okay, there's only one way to settle this.
we both have to have her.
we both have had her. No.
now. Right here.
Oh, no. no, no, no. Trixie, you know I'm a fan.
you got mad skills and all -- whip it out, Moody!
one girl, two cocks -- ultimate showdown.
so, so tempting. But I'm still gonna have to pass.
what's that word again? Uh, "pussy." -Yes, thank you.
but any scenario involving two cocks I'm generally not down with.
unless they're my own.
don't you sometimes wish you had two cocks?
I know I do. Oh!
I guess not.
for the sake of, uh, business,
that little prick should think I'm kicking your ass.
feel free to fight back anytime.
what's going on?
typical male-ego bullshit.
I've had both of them, but what they seem to forget is that they both paid for the sex.
it is my job to make them feel good.
though I must say that the brown-haired one, Hank -- he's pretty damn good in the sack department.
have we met?
no. Trixie.
Karen.
you're Karen.
Hank's Karen.
that's right.
you jumped in the car! Happily ever after.
that's awesome! Good for you!
Thanks.
Karen.
Hey! hey! sweetie!
Hey, did you get the job?
Yeah.
Oh, fantastic.
so, you want to...get something to eat?
Moroccan? Ethiopian?
Italian.
Indian!
Hey, sweetie.
are you tucking me in or avoiding mom?
what, I can't do two things at once?
was it worth it?
what?
whatever you did to piss her off.
how was school?
fine.
"fine"?
already your vocabulary has decreased.
I met someone with frontal-lobe capacity.
name? -Damien.
they have girls named Damien now? wow.
not anymore, honey.
I heart you.
Oh, my god. You reek of cigarettes.
Yes, but they're not my cigarettes.
Hank...
what are you doing?
I am charming you into our first post-snip, safe/unsafe romance explosion.
are you as excited as I am?
no.
no?
that's it? no?
nothing about you is really turning me on right now.
there's always angry sex.
you actually think this is funny?
it's a little funny -- you think
sleeping with prostitutes is fucking funny?!
one prostitute, and I didn't even know she was a prostitute until after.
you mean until after you paid her to have sex with you?
well, technically, Charlie paid for the sex. That's disgusting.
but you met her. She was nice, right?
she didn't seem like a prostitute, did she?
I have no idea, Hank.
I mean, you're the expert. You tell me.
is there like a group-discount thing?
do you have a little punch card that you use?
one time. I was lonely. She was nice.
and I don't think that's any worse than buying somebody a drink.
actually, I think it's more honest.
there's no bullshit element of seduction.
you know, what right does the government have -- Oh, please!
shut the fuck up, Hank, okay?
I mean, don't give me one of your fucking bullshit lectures on libertarianism right now!
but, honey, that makes me kind of sad,
because you used to love my bullshit lectures on libertarianism.
you're still fucking joking.
no, I mean, how could I be -- we weren't together.
I'm not gonna be held accountable for those sins. No, of course not.
you're not accountable for any of it.
Oops, I accidentally went down on her.
not my fault.
Oh, officer, you know, that cop, he provoked me.
I mean, Hank, you always have some fucking excuse!
and I'm just meant to stand here and accept it... -no, no -- ...
over and over again and I'm sick of it!
fuck, Karen, you want to be mad about that shit?
then go ahead, be mad about that shit,
but just don't give me some bullshit about how you forgive me
and then dredge up shit from the past that I can't possibly fix!
that's not forgiveness!
that's not giving it another shot!
I'm not talking about the past, okay?
I'm talking about right now.
I'm talking about trying to make this work, Hank!
okay, well, how am I different from this morning?
what's changed?
Yeah, nothing's changed. You're right.
that's the fucking problem.
no, I'll tell you the fucking problem is that I won't sit here.
and be crucified for shit that I did while we were apart.
did I fuck half of Venice? Yes.
Oh, plea-- I -- no, not really.
I really don't need to hear that.
but for the sake of this argument -- yes.
but I didn't move in with any of them.
and I didn't set up house with Becca and the fucking dial tone.
okay, right.
well, you know, now who's crucifying who?!
I mean, that's not very forgiving, Hank, is it?
it's not very nice.
Oh, I fucking hate you!
man: I didn't become a member of that thing.
my name is Ronnie, calling from the Barack Obama campaign here in Des Moines.
and just wanted to try to get acquainted with people in the community.
I'm gonna be working in that area through the caucuses in January.
you do caucus? Well, that's great.
have you decided who you'll be supporting?
not yet. Well, you're right. It is awfully early.
well, Alvin, is there a particular issue that you care about?
something that stands out in your mind?
Ronnie CHO: Basically just trying to get out there and meeting with activists to let them know that we're here, and we'd like to talk to them.
you know, people wanna see him, but don't necessarily know a lot about him.
he is the biggest and best tool we have in terms of drawing people in to get interested.
I think that's half the battle.
how are you? Having fun? What's going on, bro?
it's been a couple of crazy days, huh? I like this.
you like it? Yeah, I do.
okay, good.
Linda, I can't wait for...
to see you on the 30th, and let's just stay in touch.
say hi to your husband and son for me.
all right. Bye-bye.
voting on... -I may want to...
sorry, after these next two calls...
GIBBS: Yes, sir.
...are we going straight to the farm thing? Yes.
okay, I... We're gonna do the remaining press calls in the car.
I just want a second to change out of..., This is not...
Yes, sir. I hear you.
...sort of the best outfit for rural America.
Yeah, we've got overalls.
I'm not gonna wear overalls.
and a horse. Is that gonna be a problem?
a horse I wouldn't mind. Actually, that sounds kind of cool.
obama: So I just wanna check in and find out what we need to do to earn your support.
because I think once I get you, that puts us over the top.
then I've got Iowa at that point.
I understand completely.
but, you know, the one thing I will say is that we wanna make sure that anybody who's supporting us, that this is all part of a single team.
I'm fascinated by Obama.
here's a man who's been in town, Washington, for two years.
he hasn't near as I can tell, hasn't done a thing.
apparently there's no performance criteria in the process of selecting somebody to be President.
nobody asks the question, what has he, in fact, ever done?
woman: What do you think of Barack Obama?
I think he's a cool guy.
I don't know much about the guy, to be honest with you.
I have no clue who that is. MAN: You don't?
I have no clue who that is. Okay.
wait, is he African American? Yeah.
okay. That would be really cool if he was our next President, then.
I got an "O," you got a "bama." O... ALL: Bama!
o! ALL: Bama!
I got an "O," you got a "bama." O... ALL: Bama!
o! ALL: Bama!
I got an "O," you got a "bama." O... ALL: Bama!
o! ALL: Bama!
o! ALL: Bama!
I haven't done this since
I campaigned for Bobby Kennedy back in the mid-'60s, '68.
there just hasn't been anybody that's been exciting enough.
all: I-O-W-A, Barack Obama all the way!
I-O-W-A, Barack Obama all the way!
I-O-W-A, Barack Obama all the way!
woman: Do you think this country is ready to elect the first African American President?
no, no. -Sure？
not even Colin Powell? He would get elected.
that's a different story. He's smart enough to know not to run.
woman 1: Right now, I have to say that I'm looking at Edwards.
I would like to see Richardson.
woman 2: I don't like any of the candidates.
I don't think any of them are the right people.
I think Hillary's been around too long.
she doesn't stand for anything anymore.
obama's wonderful, but he's just a little too young and untried.
of course, after Bush, anybody can be President.
I can be President.
you know, it's for good reason. If you think about it, the odds of me standing here are very slim.
I wasn't born to money. I wasn't born to fame.
I didn't have a famous family member.
my father left when I was two years old.
I was raised by a single mom and by my grandparents.
and so they gave me love, and they gave me an education, and they gave me hope.
I met Barack Obama in 1992. He was an extraordinary guy.
he was thoughtful. He was funny, and he was obviously well-motivated.
in 2002, I heard that he was considering a race in 2004 for the Senate.
and I felt like if you could elect Barack Obama to the United States Senate, that you would be doing something that you could be proud of for the rest of your life.
she was the manager of my first campaign.
Yes, I was.
Carol Harwell, from the west side of Chicago.
right on.
if it weren't for her, I'd be nowhere.
thank you.
over the course of time, and particularly in the spring of 2006, Leading into the summer, everywhere he went, he was drawing huge crowds. And at each event, people would say, "You really ought to think about running for President.
barack asked us a lot of questions and we said, "Why would you want to run for President of the United States?"
and he said, "I have a strong feeling about what it would mean to a lot of young kids around this country the moment I raised my hand and swore that oath, because all of a sudden anything would be possible."
I appreciate you taking the time to come out, even though it's a little hot.
Sam, are you going to shake his hand?
I know. But, you know, my daughter...
how old are you? Nine?
Yeah, my daughter's nine. She explained to me, "Dad, you know, kids don't shake hands. They just say, 'Hey."'
I think I'm gonna win again. That's my prediction.
you just see.
all right, Sasha.
Sasha!
I'm sorry!
you just ruined everything! That was a perfect...
would you get that? -I'll get it.
if it's Kathy, tell her she can stay as long as she wants.
hello.
Hi, Daddy.
it's Daddy. Dada.
I'm fine. Daddy, I had to eat a lot of chocolate today.
Yup.
okay. I love you. Okay.
Hi, Daddy.
good. Yes, I went to gym.
I played with Poi balls.
poi balls. You wanna talk to Mama?
okay. Mommy.
all right, I played, Malia played, you play.
your turn.
Hey. Hello?
MICHELLE: I had, you know, a lot of practical questions that I needed answers to before I could say definitively that this is something that I could handle.
which I was telling Lizzie about.
Yeah, that is funny how they do...
MICHELLE: How was this gonna work?
what would be the schedule? How often would Barack be on the road?
what would be expected of me as a campaigner and spokesperson?
now I'm really not tired. A little ice cream boost.
you wanna hold onto this? Can I have a lick?
you can. Yeah, it's your second.
malia, can I have a lick?
malia, can I have a lick?
and how would we structure our time to ensure that our girls would not be pulled out of their lives?
how much would it cost us as a family?
how were we financially going to handle me reducing my hours at work to be able to participate?
what would the campaign do, if anything, about security?
we obviously got all those questions answered to my satisfaction, and as a result, we are now running for President.
woman: What are you gonna be when you grow up?
I wanna be an actress.
how do you feel about your dad running for President?
what's it been like?
it's cool and sometimes, I mean, I wish we could spend more time with him.
and sometimes, you know, it's cool going to different places and stuff.
it's hot.
Hi, how are you?
VIETOR: This is actually taped.
it's taped.
it was supposed to be live, and then our sat truck went down, of course.
no problem.
woman: How did this event go?
it was great, except for the seven trains that went by and the bug that he ate.
other than that...
VIETOR: I'll never forget the first time I met Barack.
I was in this office, and we were working on the weekends, and he walks in, and I sort of pop up and shake his hand.
he was great. I mean, I didn't spend a lot of time with him until I got to the Senate.
I always sort of felt like there wasn't a day where I didn't feel like he was uniquely qualified to do anything.
you know, be a senator, be a CEO, lead the country.
and that's what's so impressive about the guy.
paul TEWES: Senator, you're going to take a little staff picture here.
okay. Hey, guys. Hey, how are you?
this is my Polk County staff?
man: Yeah. They're here, some of them.
senator. Good-looking group, good-looking bunch.
are any of these people over 30?
Nope.
david PLOUFFE: You're part of something really historic today.
and we've got 10, 000, 15, 000 people around the country, right now as we speak, knocking doors and attending events and spreading the message about the campaign.
what this really speaks to is the kind of grassroots enthusiasm that Barack Obama's candidacy is inspiring all across the country.
he's a community organizer at heart.
so door-to-door canvassing, phone calls, real contact with voters.
even in a Presidential campaign, his firm belief is that to both succeed electorally and transform the country and make the changes we need to, we need to build a grassroots movement for change.
woman: Where are you going to walk? Just here in Illinois.
can we come follow you?
well, I've gotta wait for my son to wake up.
so this is kind of our own freelance canvas.
barack is walking in about 20 minutes.
thanks for coming out. Hey, everybody.
I just wanted to say thank you so much for...
although, you know, this isn't a bad day to be outside.
I just wanna let all of you know.
I want to shake hands with everybody.
Hi, Kim, good to see you. How are you?
very nice to meet you. Welcome to lowa.
AXELROD: Running for President is like being an astronaut.
you can go in the simulator all you want, but until you're orbiting in space, you don't really know what it's gonna be like.
I've been shaking hands for three straight hours.
straight. Straight. You guys are killing me. I'm physically spent.
I don't know how I'm gonna give a speech.
it's like I've been through a wrestling match.
Marvin. MARVIN NICHOLSON: Yes, sir.
you all are killing me, man. What's the matter?
I've been shaking hands for three hours straight.
we're early, though.
we're early.
NICHOLSON: We're early, though.
man: You've got a lot more hands to shake in this state.
good morning again.
good to see you.
okay, so I wanna emphasize that. I'm gonna talk about CAFE.
I'm gonna talk about cap and trade, low carbon standard, the equivalent of removing...
now, you know, there was a statistic,
I don't know if you guys still have it, that you're making a fuel less harmful and then you're also making the cars use less fuel, and in combination, then it ends up being real powerful.
woman ON LOUDSPEAKER: ... to get engaged in this most important process.
the whole country is watching us.
we came here to listen. This man came here to talk to you, he came here to listen to you.
this is our place, this is his time, this is Senator Barack Obama.
AXELROD: I mean, there really isn't any corollary for what he's gone through, because almost every candidate for President, save a very few, start off in semi-obscurity and then work their way up.
I always say most of them get to try their stuff out in New Haven and Topeka before they get to Broadway.
we opened up right on Broadway, critics in the front row.
and that's an awful lot of pressure.
the reality is Obama is not gonna be the nominee for the simple fact that he's never run a competitive race outside his state legislative district in Illinois.
that is not gonna happen.
he can't win the election.
woman: Why not?
I don't think that America's ready for it yet.
just because of his race and his views.
people are saying, like, they're viewing him kind of as a terrorist.
they associate him with the terrorists and stuff, so it's...
I don't know. I think he'll have a tough time winning just because of that whole association by race.
I find it kind of interesting, everybody keeps asking me, "Well, you think that Obama got a leg up because he's African American"?
my question is, well, does Clinton have a leg up because she's a woman?
I'm actually going to wear a button for Hillary this time.
and then my husband won't commit himself.
but if he doesn't vote for her, we've been married 41 years, if he doesn't vote for her, we're through.
we gotta put up a fight against Hillary.
we've had about 20 years of the Bushes and Hillarys.
we want a fresh start. Fresh face. That's Barack Obama.
is Hillary Clinton pulling away for the Democratic nomination?
a new USA Today Gallup poll gives her a double-digit lead right now over Barack Obama. Is she the inevitable nominee?
has Hillary Clinton got this thing locked?
woman: Good job, Hillary, good job.
that's right. You know, if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.
woman ON PA: Finally. All right, you can pick out any prize you like.
do you want an update? I'm trying to get him on TV.
local NBC affiliate live at 6: 00.
but I have no clue where we're gonna be, where we are now, or how long it's going to take to get there.
it's literally on our way out.
Hey, I'm Tommy.
Hey, Tommy. Tommy Vietor?
Yeah. Scott Helman from The Boston Globe.
Hey, man. How are you?
I've been reading you forever.
you know, swearing about Boston sports...
way to stick it to us on that crap lobbying story.
Yeah, I knew you wouldn't like that.
that's such bullshit. When are we gonna move past the "gotcha" story?
come on, that was totally not bullshit...
here's the reason it's a bullshit story.
sir, we did two. Is that okay?
woman: Look at that. Wow.
which one... Which one is it?
Yeah, you did it, I think.
woman: Yeah, you got it.
I got it. Hey, thank you. Will you sign her thing?
will you sign her fan? I got a picture of you and Hillary.
yesterday was Dave's birthday.
Yeah, you told me.
okay, I just wanted to make sure.
Dave, we're here.
Dave PRICE: All right, we're with Senator Barack Obama, outside our "cast your kernel poll" here.
senator, if you would like the honor here of actually voting...
there's your corn kernel.
now, as you may see here, sir, you're getting out-jarred.
obama: Excuse me, everybody.
I need everybody to get a corn kernel and start filling up a jar.
you don't want me to be behind.
it's heartbreaking, so we need to catch up.
by Sunday, we're gonna have overtaken all the other candidates when it comes to their corn kernels, all right?
do I have a commitment? Thank you, guys.
Hello, is this Barbara? My name's Lorenzo, and I'm nine years old.
I'm a volunteer with the Obama campaign. How are you?
who's Diana? Who's Diana?
obama is a candidate running for President.
no, not Diana, Obama. Well, he's a candidate running for President.
he's a candidate running for President of the United States of America.
no, Hillary is running for President. Obama...
hope you have a wonderful day.
how are you, sir?
what's your name? Joe Scott.
good to see you, Joe. How you been? Is this your shop?
no. Oh.
Hi, Barack.
John. Nice to meet you, John.
Sarah. Nice to meet you. Hey, Sarah, good to see you.
Kay. Hey, Kay.
rose. You, too. Nice to meet you.
well, thank you very much for saying hello.
this is as nice of a downtown as I've seen.
obama has raised more money, a little bit more money than Hillary.
yet, if you look at the national polls, his momentum just stalled at a certain point this summer.
people are starting to question whether he has what it takes to take down Hillary.
Congratulations. Thank you.
so the question everyone has been waiting to have answered in this campaign, is when is Obama going to start moving in these national polls?
Chris WELCH: Senator, Hillary Clinton's widening her lead with a 30-point lead.
I have to ask. I have to ask. Does it concern you at all?
come on. I mean... We're having a good time in lowa.
you know, the national poll story will run...
sooner or later it has to run itself out.
at some point, there will be the first actual vote.
Lynn SWEET: I think these polls can change.
I think he's not in the best position to win, but by no means is he not in a position to win.
the strength of Obama's calling card is he's a community organizer, and this campaign is his laboratory for organizing.
he's got my vote. He's on time.
he showed up on time, he's got my vote.
woman: Are you guys getting excited for the big dinner?
I am.
you are? Yeah.
speech all ready? I haven't written it yet.
Oh, yeah.
jon is, in my view, a brilliant young guy.
woman: Is he a hero of yours?
Yeah, he's one of them, for sure. I mean, you know, cliché, but as a speechwriter, you always look to some Kennedy for sure.
I think for speeches, even Bobby Kennedy's speeches are probably even more inspirational in some senses.
it's a little more like Barack, I think.
AXELROD: I think he has a good ear for Barack's voice.
it's a very tough thing to be a speechwriter for Barack, because Barack is the best speechwriter in our group.
you guys may argue with me on this, but, again, I'm just trying to give a little bit of a...
I want this to be populist, but I want a little bit of a flavor, forward-looking.
so one place we could put it, "I will eliminate capital gains tax "for small business and start-ups "with their engine of growth...
FAVREAU: He always wrote most of his speeches himself before this.
he's had to get used to having writers around, just because of the nature of a Presidential campaign.
but he doesn't give up. You know, he's still the chief speechwriter, always.
...I think the opposite of tomorrow.
we are 77, 78, something like that, days out from the lowa caucus.
I am working on the speech he'll give at the Jefferson Jackson dinner in Iowa, which is a pretty big deal where all the candidates are gonna appear at the same time.
it's a big organizational test of each campaign to see who can turn out the most people, the most raucous crowd, give a great speech.
we think, of the 9, 000 people going to JJ tonight, we know 3, 000 are our folks.
three thousand or more, as you can see.
the Barack Obama campaign and literally about 800 dedicated campaign supporters.
it's pretty ridiculous.
there he is.
crazy. Democracy.
if you don't make that into a commercial, you should be sued for malpractice.
people ask me, "Why do you think you can win lowa?"
and I think if we're in a close race, these kids, they're gonna win it for us.
thank you, guys.
AXELROD: They think they're changing the world, and that that's the best thing that they could do.
and God bless them. We need more of that.
the good news is I think they are. Yeah.
obama: I am running in this race because of what Dr. King called "the fierce urgency of now.
I believe the American people are tired of fear And tired of distractions and tired of diversions.
we can make this election not about fear, but about the future.
and that won't just be a Democratic victory.
that will be an American victory.
that's why I'm running, Democrats.
thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
thank you.
AXELROD: The JJ was a big test.
nine thousand people and the whole political world focused on him.
your opponent sitting in front of you. No teleprompter, no notes.
just you and this crowd, and he just knocked it out of the park.
and I think the campaign changed dramatically that day.
she's so real. I'm here to tell you.
these are your folks, Mike?
we love Mike.
obama: I just wanna say to the parents, thank you for doing a great job.
I want to say to the organizers, don't believe everything I'm saying right now, because I'm talking to your parents.
you better be working hard over these last two months.
we've got a lot of work to do.
we gotta go get some caucus goers.
we gotta knock on doors. We gotta make phone calls.
we've gotta get everybody in Iowa fired up and ready to go!
I'm finding supporters out of the woodwork.
my neighbors down the street I had no idea about are supporting Obama.
you can tell that, you know, the momentum has definitely shifted.
I remember there were times when people couldn't even pronounce "Barack Obama," much less end up caucusing for him.
so we've come a long way.
we're going to get started. This is Stephanie Grobman.
Hey, I was looking for you. What happened?
I had to pick up Senator Wofford from the airport.
that's so nice of you. Was he nice?
Yeah, he was.
man: Ready?
obama: You know, I think that we are at this moment that doesn't come around that often, where we've got a chance to make big change.
after seven years of disastrous foreign policy and a country that is more divided and less competitive than it was before,
I think not only Democrats but Republicans and Independents are looking for something new.
woman: Anything keeping you up at night at this point?
nothing keeps me up at night.
you must be exhausted.
Yeah, it's tiring. Actually, the one thing that keeps me up at night is the prospect of dealing with all the problems that we've got right now.
and so when I fret, it's not about the campaign, it's about governing and figuring out how can we lead this country to a better direction.
do you have time to reflect on what's happening to you?
no. At some point I will.
cand Y CROWLEY: He seems different now.
I sensed before that this civil rights professor walked in and gave very deliberative answers, all of which is laudable.
you know, he thinks things through.
but in sound bite world, he was terrible.
well, now that Barack Obama that flashed onto the national scene is showing up in Waterloo.
his trajectory is good at this point. Now, can he bring it home?
that's the beauty of Iowa, nobody knows.
PLOUFFE: All right, everybody, thanks for getting on the phone.
twelve months ago today, Barack was in Hawaii wrestling whether to run on Christmas Eve. We had no infrastructure.
if ever there was a David versus Goliath situation if Barack were to run, this is it.
barack came back from Hawaii and told us he was gonna run for the Presidency, and this improbable journey began.
we were facing the most dominant national frontrunner our party has seen in a generation, if not more.
I talked to Barack when he landed, after having been out in Iowa with you guys on that bus tour, and he said, "You know, I really wanna win this.
I said, "Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
and he said, "No, I really wanna win Iowa.
I said, "Yeah, you know, if we win Iowa," "I think we're off to the races."
he says, "No, no, it's not about anything like that."
he says, "I wanna win for those kids.
he believes so strongly in what you guys are doing.
in eight days, we're gonna win the Iowa caucus.
in 13 days, we're gonna win the New Hampshire primary.
twenty-four days, the Nevada caucus.
thirty-one days, the South Carolina primary.
in 39 days on February 5th, we're gonna clinch this nomination.
then we'll have to deal with Mitt or Rudy or Huckabee or whatever asshole they nominate, and November 4th, you all on this phone are gonna be responsible for electing Barack Obama the 44th President of the United States.
MICHELLE: Good. How's it going? WOMAN: It's going very...
all right, well, we need your support, too.
Yeah.
you both undecided?
we're undecided.
goodness. You gotta work on them.
but all of our family's for Barack.
we need your support.
I haven't decided yet, but...
were you listening to me? Yeah.
were you awake? Republican.
were you awake? Yeah.
you know you love me.
caucus for Obama. Say, "Yes, I am."
will you sign this? I will.
he says that if Barack Obama gets nominated, we won't have to worry about living on peanuts.
that's right. That's absolutely right.
richard WOLFFE: It's New Year's Eve, and everyone's on tenterhooks waiting for the Des Moines Register poll, which is the serious poll of what's gonna happen in the caucuses just a few days away.
twenty at this point.
man 1: Oh, shit, it's up. MAN 2: What's that?
what is it? WOMAN: And?
man 3: Obama 32, Clinton 25, Edwards 24.
that's wonderful!
32 to 25. That's gonna do it.
all right. Love you, too, Mom. Bye. Yeah, seven points, baby.
I asked for a seven-point lead today, who knew?
all: Fired up, ready to go!
fired up, ready to go!
fired up, ready to go!
fired up, ready to go!
listen, listen. I really want everybody to know this.
polls don't mean shit.
and if you think tonight that this is done, you're wrong.
this is a close, close, close race.
and we are on the verge of making history.
on the verge! And what we do tomorrow, what we do the next day, and what we do the day after that, determines whether we're gonna make history or not.
obama: Michelle and I had a really interesting conversation.
and she said, "We're not doing this again."
well, at first I thought she just meant, well, you know what, I'm never home, and it's hard on the family.
and she meant a little bit of that.
but what she really meant was, you know, the reason that it was important for us to do this now, the reason it's better for us to do it now than later is we're still almost normal.
which I loved. It was a great line.
I attribute it to you, it was a good line. And what she meant was, you know, five years ago, six years ago, we had just finished paying off our student loans.
MICHELLE: Three years ago. What are you talking...
well, no, it was actually five or six.
we were still living in a condo.
it was a little bit too small for the kids, a growing family.
we still had credit card debt.
we were trying to figure out how to save for college for the girls and save for our retirement.
I mean, the point is that we've gone through what people are going through right now, relatively recently.
we don't forget it.
and so when I go into the White House,
I will be carrying your voices with me.
what it comes down to is, who do you trust?
and, you know, I think that if you trust me, then I think I'll deliver for you.
all right. I'm gonna go to bed.
it's caucus day. I saw Tom Vilsack, the former governor, lowa governor.
he said, "Happy Caucus Day." Who ever thought that was a greeting?
CHO: So, you guys know where to go?
Altoona, Being There Coffee House. We're gonna be in there.
ten minutes. We'll leave right now. Grab a sign.
a little good old-fashioned visibility right down Main Street, USA.
I remember feeling so proud of this opportunity, and, you know, my parents really have truly come from absolutely nothing.
my dad's never had any money in his life.
my mom, she's from Seoul, Korea.
she was born and raised there and moved out here when my mom and dad got married.
we lived in a car for the first couple of years of my life.
and I was the first member of my family to go to college, and now I'm working for Barack Obama, right.
like, just one of those stories.
Hey, have you guys seen this one, where we do the O dance?
all right, everyone's gotta do it. So let's get in over here.
all right, so you remember the episode of The Fresh Prince, where they were, like... That one he's doing the little dance, like this.
so everyone watch me, and then we're all gonna do this.
woman: How do you feel today?
good. Confident. I feel like we did everything we could.
and the crowds have been great, and the volunteers have been great.
nice to see you.
nice to see you. Thank you.
Ethan, who are you voting for?
who are you voting for?
I'm voting for Barack Obama.
we've been doing this for months, and this is it.
we've worked too hard to let this go now.
so now it's just close the deal.
we have to close the deal. This just means too much. Means too much.
new Hampshire in the morning?
Mike, you're making me... You're going to make me cry.
I've been like this all day. I've been so emotional today.
don't do this to me, man. Don't do this to me.
woman: Did you sleep at all last night?
Yeah, for like two or three hours.
Yeah, it was great. It was great.
man 1 ON TV:"You may put a fork in her, her goose will be cooked."
the receiving end of a tirade.
man 2: We'll see. MAN 1: We'll see soon, just a little bit more than an hour from now, what's going on.
GIBBS: You can say, "And finally," there.
a third place finish not a death blow to the Hillary campaign...
let's do it.
well, Wolf, I think the most important thing to remember about the Democratic caucuses is they're not an election.
they are a caucus. They're more like a meeting.
and people stand up and be counted.
they actually walk up to their candidate's location.
they usually put up a poster for each candidate.
and in front of their neighbors, they decide who to vote for.
and now we come to the key rule.
any candidate who is 15% Or more gets to go on to the next round.
it's called the viability threshold.
and any candidate who is not, does not get 15%, they're out.
TEWES: I always think that people should witness the Iowa caucuses firsthand, because I do believe it's true democracy in action.
this is so exciting. The parking lot is full.
Yes. People are streaming in.
it's democracy in action.
I've seen a lot of my neighbors here, and they're all on Obama's side, and that's great.
there'll be a lot of cajoling. People will say, "Hey, hey, come over to our side,
and you're like, "No, I'm an Obama supporter. I'm staying put.
this is many more people than we were expecting, about four times more.
this is like listening to the pre-game of the Super Bowl.
none of it matters.
just kick off the damn ball.
you may now break into your preference groups.
obama. You can sit towards the ends. Obama over here.
obama people, hold your hands up. We're gonna start counting.
hold them up!
so when you say it's crazy, what does that mean?
biden, Dodd and Richardson are not viable.
this is our final round of realignment.
I'm a Republican. I registered Democrat.
that's why I'm here. Just get in there, go Obama.
we need two more people.
somebody get in the hallway and find me two people.
I need someone with a green card, and I don't mean the immigration kind.
sir, have you already given your vote?
you guys wanna be with the winners? Okay.
I'm inviting you to join us, in with the Obama group.
how about some stickers?
give me a sticker.
Hey, hey.
I need one person for Obama.
you don't wanna be counted for Obama?
Yes, I've been counted for Obama.
Yes, thank you. You rock. High five.
that's the latest.
do we elect eight delegates to the county convention from this precinct?
edwards will elect two delegates.
obama will elect four delegates.
clinton will elect two delegates.
we are back on the air here in Des Moines, and we have news to report at this hour.
nbc News is projecting that when all the caucus goers' preferences are counted up,
barack Obama will win the Iowa caucuses on the Democratic side.
holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit!
woman: Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
history. History. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.
there is hope. H-O-P-E.
woman: How are you feeling?
pretty good. We just told her.
woman: You did? What'd she say?
not much. She jumped.
who knew? I might throw up now. It's okay, though.
Wow.
what?
VIETOR: Just one state, 49 more.
sweet: Winning Iowa is a big victory for Barack Obama.
this gives him the momentum to be the first African American to actually win the Presidency.
nice hat.
man: Just trying to keep my ears warm.
for a state that has so few minorities as lowa has,
I think we proved a lot of people wrong tonight.
woman ON PA: So now I would like to introduce you to the next first family of the United States of America.
thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Iowa.
I used to get really kind of ecstatic at things like this, but now Plouffe's rubbing off on me, and I've got a real even kind of metabolism.
we'll win New Hampshire in five days, and then we'll feel really good.
Ronnie's MO THER ON PHONE: How are you feeling?
I feel good.
it's overwhelming, isn't it?
Oh, man.
it's expected but it's unexpected. It's a good feeling.
this is not over, honey, but it is now over in this state.
I'm so proud of you, how you acted and how you worked, honey.
what I was so pleased with was not just the fact that we won or the raw numbers, but what it showed about the country.
I think it's fair to say that there were some who were skeptical that young people would come out, that Independents and Republicans would be voting Democratic, caucusing in a Democratic caucus.
man 1: Wait, can you just describe that moment when it sort of sunk in to you and your family that, "I won the first battle."
we felt good for the last two weeks.
because we were so proud of what was happening on the ground.
we were seeing the crowds.
and so regardless of how the numbers played out exactly, we were really confident about us having changed how politics operated in this caucus.
and it makes me very optimistic about the country.
I think we can do it with the country as a whole.
thank you, guys.
all right. That wasn't bad, guys.
all right, let me go to sleep now.
man 2: Thanks, Senator.
man 3: Can you sleep? You bet.
what is this?
obama: Reggie, how come we can't see the Patriots game?
AXELROD: It's blacked out.
how can the Patriots game be blocked out?
AXELROD: They say we didn't purchase it.
toot, it's your grandson. I realized I hadn't talked to you.
and so I was thinking... That was in fact how I started thinking about how come I'm not in Hawaii right now.
because that's where I usually am.
that's where I belong. Exactly.
woman: Who's that?
me and Uncle Rocky.
uncle Rocky has big ears.
konrad NG: What's it like to have Barack Obama as your brother and my brother-in-law?
there are moments, of course, when you recognize that there's sacrifice involved.
and like I said, he belongs to the world now, and you have to sort of come to terms with that.
and to know that your conversations aren't necessarily going to be as long.
he's awfully busy.
and that you might not have him for two weeks at Christmastime, and December, that sort of thing.
but again, you realize, well, it is worth it.
Neil ABERCROMBIE: His father had been spotted by AID folks in Kenya as someone with the kind of intellect, the kind of drive, the kind of energy, that we were hoping to attract as students back in those days, in the late '50s, early '60s, to come to the United States.
Barack's mother, almost the mirror opposite.
she was sweet and kind, but very, very smart.
but a much more placid personality.
still water ran deep with her.
it's an interesting thing, because he is the embodiment of his mom in his demeanor, but his intellect, of course, is like his dad.
I've always said that
Barack, he'd always be that voice of reason.
so as a kid, he had that voice of reason.
he wasn't one of those kids who just went with the flow because that's what you're supposed to do.
and I do see that in him now, as an adult, and I think that's what appeals to so many people.
SOETORO-NG: This is where Barack grew up with our grandparents.
they lived on the 10th floor, and our grandmother still resides there.
TITCOMB: His grandparents, you know, you call them grandparents, but they were his parents, you know, growing up here.
he was just a very normal boy.
he wanted to be a big-time basketball player.
and he played basketball every minute that he could.
he had a group of boys that would come over to this apartment and raid the refrigerator, and who'd play basketball and do things.
I know this is hard on you, missing all of us, Maya and all the kids.
well, I love you, sweetie. All right. Bye-bye.
Yeah. That was a good call.
crowd: Fired up, ready to go!
crowd: Obama! Obama!
last night, Barack Obama won an historic victory in Iowa, beating Hillary Clinton.
for Clinton, what was once considered inevitable is now barely likely.
are Democrats over Hill and looking for a change?
is Barack Obama on the eve of what looks like a victory?
not only that, I mean, it looks like the trajectory is still going up.
male REPORTER: Senator Clinton has been way ahead in the polls here in New Hampshire.
how do you think lowa is going to impact what happens here?
I actually don't think she's been way ahead in the polls.
she was way ahead in the polls at one time.
she's not way ahead in the polls now.
Obama!
we got used to him having big crowds, okay.
but to get a big crowd in New Hampshire...
woman: We'll just take a picture of you.
...is really unusual.
I mean, look at this line. It stretches...
around the block doesn't do it justice.
something's happening here.
these people are still here.
because their movie's now gonna get a lot better.
Hey, guys, this is it. This is our army.
I don't know who thought about doing a college rally at 8: 30. That's stupid.
man ON PA: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...
... and future First Lady, Michelle Obama.
follow the arrow out. In case I was like, "Where do I go"?
barack Obama is surging right now in the polls.
hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney are sinking.
can Clinton and Romney survive if they lose tomorrow?
young people voted at the same rate as senior citizens, which...
woman: You did well across all of them.
we did. We won all of them.
but still, just to see all these new people to decide, "We're going to try this time.
here's when Democrats in New Hampshire will make their minds up, and Independents. Tomorrow, the debate.
how will Hillary perform? She does well in debates.
what can you say to the voters of New Hampshire on this stage tonight who see your resume and like it, but are hesitating on the likeability issue, where they seem to like Barack Obama more?
well, that hurts my feelings.
Chris MATTHEWS: I'm sorry, Senator.
but I'll try to go on. He's very likable. I agree with that.
I don't think I'm that bad.
you're likable enough, Hillary, no doubt. Thank you so much, Barack.
so I was riding in the bus with him on Monday, before the primary, and someone said...
looked at their e-mail or something and said, "Gee, Hillary had a breakdown of some sort "on the trail, and it's online.
you know, I have so many opportunities from this country.
I just don't want to see us fall backwards, you know, so...
you know, this is very personal for me.
it's not just political. It's not just public.
I see what's happening, and we have to reverse it.
AXELROD: I remember thinking at that moment, I don't know. I don't know how this is gonna play.
because one of the things that had plagued her was this sort of lack of authenticity and humanity, and here was this very human moment.
and whether she was crying because she was losing or not, she was showing an emotion people could relate to.
Mr. Obama!
man 1: Come on, come on.
man 2: Are you nervous? Well, let me ask you this. What's up?
no, I'm not nervous. I feel great.
we just wanna make sure everybody goes to the polls.
we've only won one state. If we do well tonight, maybe two.
then there are 48 to go.
Linda, Hillary Clinton woke up this primary morning, her Presidential aspirations potentially on the line, ready to work for every last vote.
she traveled to five different polling sites in five hours, trying to rally her supporters, hoping to turn the tide against her predicted by the polls.
the exit polls all day have gone from...
the first wave was about nine points.
the second wave is about four or five points.
the final wave is about one point.
obama over Hillary, all three.
and now the returns that are coming in are showing her up by five or six points.
as soon as we started getting returns,
Matt Rodriguez, our state coordinator, looked at some precincts from Manchester and he said, "How could this be?"
you know, "We're gonna lose.
and CNN is now ready to project that Hillary Clinton has won the New Hampshire primary.
hillary Clinton will emerge the victor tonight.
so we went up to tell Barack that we weren't gonna win the New Hampshire primary, he having gone into his dinner with his wife thinking that he was preparing for a victory.
we were in a hotel room.
and whenever Gibbs and Axelrod come up then you know that things aren't going the way they're supposed to.
I want especially to thank New Hampshire.
over the last week, I listened to you, and in the process, I found my own voice.
he leaned against the wall and smiled kind of wanly, and said, "This thing's gonna go on for a while, isn't it?
when we've been told we're not ready or that we shouldn't try or that we can't, generations of Americans have responded with a simple creed that sums up the spirit of a people.
Yes, we can. Yes, we can!
I didn't consider that a low point in the campaign, though.
I actually thought that that was a good moment in the campaign.
it was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed a trail towards freedom through the darkest of nights.
Yes, we can.
it was the call of workers who organized, women who reached for the ballot, a President who chose the Moon as our new frontier, and a King who took us to the mountaintop and pointed the way to the promised land.
Yes, we can! To justice and equality.
obama: We had come out of Iowa so energized, and everybody was giddy.
and although I think we believed that we were guarding against hubris, you know, I'm not sure we were.
and I remember, after having lost in New Hampshire, going to my supporters over the next couple of days and saying, "I think this is a good thing. We have to earn this."
I'm getting my hair cut. How y'all doing?
I'd rather just get a haircut.
thank you. I appreciate it.
this is one of my quiet places. MAN: Right on.
all right, that means you, too.
obama: Somebody have any water for me?
man: Yeah, I'll get you a water.
do you have a card? No.
obama: I mean, you know, I feel...
I'm in a nice kind of calm.
I'm in a good place. I'm in the same place I was in Iowa.
which is, we've done everything well.
we're running a good campaign.
and if it works, it works.
and if it doesn't, it doesn't work.
Charles OMMANNEY: You're a cooler man than me.
no, it's interesting, I mean, I do get into a...
I get in to a certain point.
what frustrates me is when I feel like we're not doing what we should be doing.
then that upsets me, when I'm not playing my game.
but right now we're playing our game.
woman: You can see it on the ground, big time.
Yeah, you can feel the movement.
OMMANNEY: It's actually quite a radical feeling, too. Yeah.
you can totally feel it.
like I said, I don't know if it's enough to overcome the...
because there's a lot of people out there, you know, don't...
well, we just haven't gotten there yet. We haven't penetrated.
the thing about lowa was, we were there for 8 months.
so you knew, at a certain point, okay, they know me.
everybody's seen me.
OMMANNEY: It felt like 18 months.
Jeff ZELENY: It's February 5th. To the rest of the world, it's Fat Tuesday.
to the political reporters trapped on this plane, it's Super Tuesday, which means there are...
the Democrats are voting in 22 states.
the Republicans are voting in 21 states.
this is the biggest political day of the year.
the biggest challenge of this Super Tuesday contest is just the breadth and expansion of it.
there are contests in 22 states, 15 primaries and seven caucuses.
tonight, there are 1, 681 delegates picked for the Democratic convention, which is more than half of the delegates you need to win the nomination.
this is the first week that Senator Obama has caught up with her in national polls.
really only a week ago, he was still 10 points down.
for Senator Obama, this is probably the biggest week of his campaign.
woman: When do you think this is gonna be decided?
who knows? It could be a complete nightmare.
think by March?
there's something we call the doomsday scenario, which is like the Pennsylvania primary sometime in mid-March, but I don't even know. I don't even know.
now that we get to "a house divided cannot stand,"
it actually doesn't sound as much like a call.
are we landing on something here?
and then just applause and start the whisper thing?
Yeah. All right, "What began as a whisper in Springfield..."
can we say something like, ..."found its way to somewhere in lowa," "where people who wanted..." And then start getting a little concrete?
say that, maybe, "I want change.
Ben RHODES: "Change" sounds pretty good.
Adam FRANKEL: Not bad, right?
FAVREAU: I'm for change.
RHODES: George Bush. He's for change now, too.
I feel nervous.
I think the expectations have been cranked up too high.
and I think we'll do well. I don't know whether, because if it is jacked up expectations, I worry that the media will say we underperformed.
in any case we're gonna be going at this for a while. This is gonna be a battle.
my name is Ronnie Cho, I'm with the Barack Obama campaign.
CHO: Here in Arizona, the Latino turnout's gonna be very important for us.
BLAKE: Hopefully you heard today's Election Day.
I let go of Mike Blake a long time ago.
you get to a point where you're not even thinking about that.
you're so passionate that you want him to win.
there's a huge protest vote against Republican policies, and it's a record turnout in New Mexico.
I'm hearing the same in Arizona and Colorado, Utah, California.
CHO: There's gotta be some water. And just make sure you get it done.
we need granola bars. We need the water there.
this line is just getting longer and longer by the minute.
the Clinton campaign believes that Illinois will go for Barack.
new York, New Jersey, California will be theirs.
woman: Have you picked a candidate?
definitely Barack.
we voted for Hillary Clinton. Yeah.
I think we need a woman President.
man: Nice to see you.
I'll tell you this. I'm not gonna vote for Obama just because he's black.
how are you? I'm here.
nice to meet you.
water, anyone? All right.
he is what I dreamed about. And this, to me, is just off the charts.
all: Hillary for President!
BLAKE: Ward Five, Precinct Three.
let's just come on inside so people don't have to stand in the cold.
we absolutely annihilated here.
and Obama don't have to worry, 'cause God got him.
he is that shining light we've been looking for.
man 1: Have you ever seen lines like this?
man 2: No. No, never.
could you imagine if 85% Of the people voted every election?
you couldn't get these bums in there.
obama: I still think that Senator Clinton is the favorite.
she had 20, 30 point leads in many of these states.
we've been closing some ground.
GIBBS: What day is today?
super Tuesday. Right.
david Axelrod.
E-L-R-O-D. WOMAN: Yeah.
he's been waiting on you all day. All day.
could be a great night.
sir, Democrat or Republican?
democrat, please.
this man's been waiting on you.
you're going to ruin my reputation.
you know, look at these.
now Utah, Minnesota, North Dakota, Kansas.
I mean, there you go. We're just loading it up.
two weeks ago, we were 20 points behind in the national Gallup poll, and tonight we're basically fighting her to a draw and winning states in her own backyard.
what began as a whisper in Springfield soon carried across the cornfields of Iowa, where farmers and factory workers, students and seniors stood up in numbers we have never seen before.
it's been a clean sweep for Barack Obama on this Saturday night.
he carried the Virgin Islands. He carried Washington State,
nebraska, and now Louisiana.
obama: They stood up to say that maybe this year, this time, can be different.
Maine hands him his latest victory tonight.
it comes on the heels of a sweep of three states yesterday.
obama: Change will not come if we wait for some other person.
WOLFFE: Barack Obama has won the Potomac primary.
that's DC, Maryland and Virginia.
obama: We are the ones we've been waiting for.
she is in the midst of a losing streak of sorts.
he's gonna be the best President we've ever known.
obama: We know that what began as a whisper has now swelled to a chorus that cannot be ignored, that will not be deterred, that will ring out across this land as a hymn that will heal this nation, repair this world, make this time different than all the rest.
Yes, we can! Let's go to work.
Yes, we can. Yes, we can. Yes, we can.
thank you, Chicago. Let's go get to work. I love you.
he has successfully broadened his coalition which would be very bad news for Hillary Clinton, going into Ohio and Texas, coupled with the momentum of having won 10 consecutive primaries and caucuses.
I think we can expect a very challenging couple of weeks, is my guess.
woman: Super negative, super.
Yeah.
I never have them pegged as folks who would come out with a white flag and say, "We give up.
that's not their gestalt.
man ON TV: It's 3... 00 a. m. and your children are safe and asleep.
but there's a phone in the White House, and it's ringing.
something's happening in the world.
your vote will decide who answers that call.
whether it's someone who already knows the world's leaders, knows the military, someone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous world.
it's 3... 00 a. m. and your children are safe and asleep.
who do you want answering the phone?
I'm Hillary Clinton, and I approve this message.
computerized VOICE: Twenty-six other callers present.
TEWES: I cannot stress this enough that everybody does doors. Everybody.
this weekend, everybody on staff,
I don't care who you are. I will be doing them.
I expect the political folks to do them.
I expect the press folks to do them.
I expect the schedulers to do them.
everybody does a shift. Everybody.
obama: It's a beautiful day.
we're getting folks out campaigning everywhere, and so I just wanna make sure that I say hi to these guys coming in.
morning. How are you? Barack. All right, how are you?
good to see you. Good to see you.
how are you, sir? Nice to see you.
nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
Stephanopoulos. Hang on.
Hey.
Yeah, I agree with that. No, I agree with that.
I think that the reality of this is gonna begin to set in.
there it is. We said there's no course for her other than just search and destroy.
and I don't think there's an appetite for that in the party.
what are you asking me? Say that again, George.
woman: How are the numbers?
close.
Yeah.
they're really, really close.
like, the first wave, we were ahead in Ohio, behind in Texas...
ahead in Ohio by two and behind in Texas by one.
the second wave, she's ahead in Ohio by three, and we don't know Texas. Maybe she's ahead by two or three there.
but it's so close that these exit polls become less meaningful, you know.
so, just don't know.
you know, it could be the nightmare scenario, which is she ekes out wins in Ohio and Texas.
we win more delegates, so it's even clearer that she can't be the nominee, and yet she finds encouragement to stay and fight, fight a kind of trench warfare here. So that would be unfortunate.
woman ON TV: We have a Democratic Party in Ohio that is divided by race, gender and age.
here are the numbers. First, race.
among white voters, Clinton is winning women by a large margin.
look at that, 66% To Obama's 44%.
man: What are you saying?
their exits are so fucked. There's no way that it could even be close if the exits are right about white men and white women...
no. ...who both went for her in big numbers.
man: Right. That's what I'm saying.
Hey, guys, how are you? MAN: Hey, man.
how you been, man? How does it look out here?
we're hoping they'll fit. We've got way too many people.
too many people. Yeah, you're right.
you know what he did, Ronnie? I said they're not going to fit in the classroom. It's okay. Yeah, it's all right.
obama button, anyone? Okay, you got one. There you go.
obama button? There's one for you. Obama button? Perfect.
button. Obama button, anyone? Almost there, guys. Almost there.
all right, hang out for a little while longer, guys. Don't leave us.
how much what?
Yeah, why, are they saying they're gonna win Texas?
right. All right, I'll work something up and I'll send it to you quick.
do you know what time he's going out to speak?
okay, cool. I'll do that.
FAVREAU: Okay, third version.
everything's too close to call.
thank you for waiting.
every delegate counts, so this campaign in Texas has only a couple of hours left in it, so hang out with us, please. Don't leave.
don't leave. WOMAN: We need you.
a huge comeback for Hillary Clinton tonight in this Democratic Presidential race, and a major, major achievement for John McCain.
he captures the Republican Presidential nomination.
two storylines unfolding.
John McCain is the Republican Presidential nominee, but Hillary Clinton now coming back from a series of losses to Barack Obama since Super Tuesday.
the wins in Ohio and Texas are oh-so-significant for Hillary Clinton in going forward. Let's take a look and recap.
you know what they say, "As Ohio goes, so goes the nation.
no one says that. WOMAN: Yeah.
Hillary?
I'm doing fine. Just calling to congratulate you on Rhode Island and Ohio.
they're telling me Texas is going to be your win.
yeah it is, it is... But I...
okay. Sounds good. Talk to you soon. Bye bye.
we don't have a choice when it comes to our relatives.
we have a choice when it comes to our pastors.
God damn America! That's in the Bible for killing innocent people.
God damn America!
how could you go to this church for 20 years and not know this guy said this?
there's no way Obama can shade it.
well, I sort of agree, but I...
no, that's crazy.
bill O'REILLY: New polls say Barack Obama's taking a big hit because of his pastor, but there is a racial divide.
I think it's a bunch of crap. It's been taken out of context.
that Reverend Wright looks like a raving maniac to me.
I don't think for one moment that Obama believes in those things.
if I belonged to a church that had that much hate in it,
I wouldn't belong there very long.
I'm fearful that Obama feels the same way.
Dr. King said many of the same things.
if this is the best candidate that we have to put up for President of the United States, this country is in terrible trouble.
strictly, Obama's out.
WOLFFE: Campaigns are fashioned in the image of their maker.
and then of course the sort of main narrative of this campaign has been about his identity.
we're not used to an African American politician talking, thinking, behaving like he is.
and when a story like Reverend Wright pops up...
there have been plenty of controversial preachers, pastors in America's politics.
clearly in this case, we're fascinated by Wright and about Obama because of race.
CHO: You know, we're sort of in a street fight for the nomination here.
the events with Reverend Wright and the attacks.
you know, it makes it difficult to keep the tone of our message, and to maintain the integrity of that.
at one of our field offices, they just spray painted slurs about Barack on the window. And the downtown office, right here, somebody threw a barricade through the window, broke the windows.
it sucks. Living in a world where the rules that you're living by, the rules that the campaign lives by, aren't necessarily the rules the world lives by.
ZELENY: This week, I think, has been the most trying week of the Senator's campaign, because he really had to deal with something personal.
there were Super Delegates, there were other Democratic supporters, calling, e-mailing members of his staff saying, "Look, this is killing you.
you need to do something about this.
this is an issue that will stay with him for the rest of the campaign, however long that is.
if they come at us on this, what's it gonna look like?
is it just gonna be "God damn America!
or is it gonna be "US of KKK-A"?
if they use it, it's gonna be him condemning America.
John DEL CECATO: Right, right.
AXELROD: You know, I think we all were a little unsettled by the Wright deal.
it was coming at us with such ferocity.
if Wright became a surrogate for Barack Obama, then certainly the race was over.
what if it's like just a total, over the top...
AXELROD: Yeah. You know.
so we have two versions of a Wright response.
AXELROD: It was a troubling time and no one had a great idea about how to deal with it except Barack, which was, "Let's go right at it."
man ON TV: That's important. And I think Barack Obama talks about...
AXELROD: Barack called me up Friday night, and I think he called Plouffe as well and said "I wanna give a speech on Wright, "but it has to be bigger than Wright."
I wanna talk about this whole issue of race relations in our country.
and he said, "I don't know whether it's gonna help us or not, but I think that it's a moment in which we can confront this thing, this thing being the issue of race, in a way that could be really valuable."
man: Give me a sense of what you're anticipating from Barack Obama today.
I don't know.
it's clearly a very important speech.
it's gonna be a defining speech for him.
I hope he talks as much about patriotism and his feeling about the country as he does about race.
Reverend Wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive.
divisive at a time when we need unity.
racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems.
but I could no more disown him than I can disown my white grandmother.
a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me.
a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her by on the street.
you know, he felt good about it because he knew what he wanted to say.
he had known it for a long time, probably, and it had crystallized in his mind after the controversy erupted.
and the way he is, is that he's just confident enough in, Look, this is what I believe to be true.
this is what I think about this issue.
I'm gonna say it. If people buy it, they buy it.
if they don't, what can I do?
I spoke as honestly as I could.
WOLFFE: Well, my first impression is, just what a gutsy move it was to have the speech at all.
here you have, obviously, a candidate of a very different complexion in many ways, really confronting this hot-button, very emotional issue head on.
really, words can't describe how I felt to hear that speech.
it was moving. It really was.
he touched a lot of the bases he needed to in this speech.
he acknowledged that he heard some controversial remarks that Jeremiah Wright has made.
and then he talked about anger, but not just black anger, but white anger and then he tied it into the essential thing in his campaign, which is people could be angry or they can try to do something to change.
woman: That was a great speech.
it was pretty good.
woman: How did it feel to give it?
huh? How did it feel to give it?
strong.
I appreciate it.
we are not terribly buffeted around by the conventional wisdom crowd because the truth is every day there's something written or said that is a challenge for Barack, challenges our campaign strategy, challenges our execution.
and, you know, not that we're being arrogant, the truth is that sometimes feedback is very important, that you need to know.
but for the most part, you just gotta keep your eyes straight ahead, know where you're going, know what your strategy is to win.
as I said, we don't have a lot of message angst, 'cause Barack has a very clear sense of who he is and what he's saying.
so, I'm not making a long speech.
I just wanted to come by and say hello to everybody.
WOLFFE: The race is important.
every twist and turn is important.
but the shape of the race is what it is.
he has a lead in pledged delegates that she is highly unlikely to overturn, so this is all about an argument they're making for Super Delegates, these party insiders who are steadily trickling towards Obama.
all right, fire away.
woman: Senator, are you going to wrap up the nomination tomorrow?
we feel good about the number of Super Delegates that we've been accumulating, and my sense is that between Tuesday and Wednesday that we got a good chance of getting the number that we need to achieve the nomination, but obviously there are two more contests remaining...
senator Barack Obama goes over the threshold, goes over 2, 118 delegates.
he will be the Democratic Presidential nominee.
FAVREAU: Final speech.
woman: Really? FAVREAU: Just e-mailed.
what's the tone?
tone is victorious. Good.
you know, We won. Thank you. Thank you other candidates.
thank you, Hillary, you're great.
mccain, blah, blah, blah... Hope, change, you know.
so, listen, you know...
I think Gibbs gets the quote of the night.
man: What's that?
when we were on the bus we were watching the Celtics... Lakers...
you know, sort of the history of Magic and Bird and all these folks.
and some reporters were noticing, Barack, you don't seem too over the top.
you seem pretty calm.
and Gibbs reminded me of what Magic Johnson said.
he said, "You don't cut down the nets for the conference championship."
have your feelings towards Hillary changed at all?
I mean, can you step back now and say a little better, I can see...
no, no, you know the truth is, you know me, I'm...
I've never... I've always understood sort of the enormous expectations that she carried with her and the fiercely competitive nature of her world and the fact that she cares passionately about these issues.
my respect for her has not diminished.
what do you think the pitfall is for you in the fall?
the Republicans can't compete on the issues.
so what they are going to do is to make me into a scary guy.
and they'll use Wright and Ayers.
if the American people know me and my story and Michelle, then I think we'll win.
in the end, while this primary was long,
I am so proud we stayed the course together.
every single United States citizen had a chance to make his or her voice heard.
senator Obama has inspired so many Americans to care about politics and empowered so many more to get involved.
Hi, it's Robert Gibbs with Senator Obama. Hi, how are you?
I'm good. Senator Obama is wondering if Senator Clinton was available.
Hello? Huma, can you hear me?
Hi, Huma, it's Robert Gibbs again.
senator Obama trying to reach Senator Clinton.
Hey, Huma, this is Barack.
just calling Hillary to congratulate her on South Dakota, and I look forward to working with you guys soon.
and she can call us back anytime at 132-533-108.
hope you guys are doing well. Talk to you soon. Bye-bye.
obama: Looks pretty good out there. GIBBS: Nice setup.
NICHOLSON: Sure does.
so we filled it up, huh?
GIBBS: Barbara didn't tell you about overflow?
Dick DURBIN ON TV: ... the hearts, inspiring the dreams of a nation.
tonight, Barack Obama will accept our nomination to be President of the United States of America.
we still would have won if she hadn't dropped out.
we go backstage and then how long are we backstage?
NICHOLSON: About three minutes, I believe.
obama: I'm gonna go be quiet.
obama: When I was practicing the speech for the first time and I came to the end where I talked about King speaking in the Lincoln Memorial.
and I choked up and had to stop.
Dr. King's speech happened when I was two years old.
so anybody who's 60 or over remembers it vividly.
and the majority of African Americans at that time couldn't vote, much less run for President.
man: Go get them, Barack.
thank you.
to Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation, with profound gratitude and great humility,
I accept your nomination for the Presidency of the United States.
okay, everybody, now it's official.
we couldn't have done it without you.
I'm sorry. Okay, let's try it again.
okay, now it's official.
I can't remember this. I just gave a really long speech.
there's only two lines. Okay.
you're making me feel better, buddy.
okay, now it's official. But this...
Where's the teleprompter guy?
all right, come on, come on. Let's try this. We're gonna do this.
okay, this time we're gonna do it. All right.
Hello, everybody.
woman: How will you avoid sort of going too negative?
how will you balance it out and feel positive?
we want to make sure that people understand my agenda, what I will do as President.
I am confident that if the American people know what my plan for America is and what John McCain's plan for America is, that I will win this race.
I don't spend a lot of time thinking about John McCain's negative ads.
if I did, I wouldn't be spending much time thinking about other things, 'cause they come fairly fast and frequently.
my friends and fellow Americans,
I am very pleased and very privileged to introduce to you the next Vice President of the United States, Governor Sarah Palin of the great state of Alaska.
are you ready to shake things up in Washington?
I think Sarah Palin has really helped spark the Republican ticket, I really do.
I don't think anybody, including the Democrats, saw this coming.
she's a dangerous person, and I just would dread the thought that she's a heartbeat away from the Presidency.
america's big.
you know, just traveling around Ohio, you realize how big this country is.
and then when you go to all 48 states in the continental United States, and you go to Hawaii.
I have to say Alaska is the one state I haven't visited, which now that I think about it,
I'm gonna have to get up there.
is there still an 18-state strategy or 50-state strategy?
or, now that we're getting down to it, are some of the states coming off the map?
we have a huge number of Bush states that McCain is defending.
so, yes, the normal battlegrounds of Ohio and Missouri are very competitive.
but there's new states. Virginia, Colorado, Indiana, North Carolina.
we're playing offense in 11 or 12 states, including states that McCain never thought he'd have to defend.
so if you look at the battleground states in the electoral ballot, we think McCain's in real trouble here, because he has to pull an inside straight at this point to win.
woman ON TV: Who is Barack Obama?
I'm afraid this is someone who sees America as imperfect enough to work with a former domestic terrorist.
woman ON TV: Barack Obama and domestic terrorist Bill Ayers.
friends. How dangerous.
on November 4th, let's leave Barack Hussein Obama wondering what happened.
obama's a terrorist. Don't you know that?
he wasn't born in America.
I do not want a black man running my country.
this is little Hussein.
AXELROD: I think it's getting very ugly out there.
I mean, what McCain and Palin are doing is really irresponsible.
I mean, they're inciting people.
don't believe for a second this election is over.
don't think for a minute that power will concede anything without a fight.
we're gonna have to work like our future depends on it in these last few days, because it does.
since the convention, it's basically been like this.
I mean, it's been a wild ride.
we saw with John McCain that the Palin pick really gave him a bounce, but really the game changer was the economy goes into this incredible meltdown.
the fundamentals of our economy are strong, but these are very, very difficult times.
and I promise you, we will never put America in this position again.
I know how tough it is right now, Nevada.
but we've faced difficult times before.
the American story has never been about things coming easy.
it's been about rising at the moment when the moment was hard.
this past week alone, we made over 450, 000 phone calls, knocked on over 110, 000 doors, but that's what it's gonna take.
so, as exhausted as we are, we were told a long time ago we wouldn't get to this point, right?
right? ALL: Right.
and a month, you know, it's pretty surreal.
in four more weeks, we finally get to the ultimate goal of winning.
which we have to win. We have to win.
woman: Here he is.
AXELROD: Right. Here he is. ANITA DUNN: Here he is.
I'm here. Hey, good to see you guys. Morning.
Ron KLAIN: Got a few new things we want to work on.
medicare, what you wanna say about McCain's announcement today.
PLOUFFE: The debates are huge. McCain jettisoned his message.
his message is all about experience. Now he's given that up.
so he's saying the election's all about change.
well, so are we. We've been saying that for 20 months.
so we think that's a debate we're well-positioned to have.
because McCain isn't changing the economy.
if you're not gonna change the economic policies that have failed the country, that's not change.
you seem to feel the need to really answer every single McCain attack.
I think our view is you're at a stage in the race, you've won two debates, your numbers are strong, where you can just push past him.
you shouldn't feel vulnerable to every single thing the guy says.
I mean, I think if he presses me on honesty,
I think there's nothing wrong with it.
the only thing is, I don't want to sound whiny about his lies.
senator McCain keeps on talking about me being risky, but let me tell the American people what's risky.
I think Senator McCain's plan for taxing your healthcare benefits, potentially leaving 20 million people without employer-based healthcare,
I think that's risky.
if this whole debate were on economics, that would be fine with us.
what role do you think character and judgment should play in the people's voting for President?
well, inevitably, Bob, it plays an important role.
the question is, Senator, what does your friendship with Bill Ayers tell us about your judgment?
well, first of all, I think it's important to note that Senator McCain's made this the centerpiece of his campaign at a time when we're going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
Mr. Ayers does not advise my campaign, and he certainly would have no involvement in my White House.
you may just wanna say, "So it's important for the American people to understand who it is that's gonna be advising me in the White House."
small thing.
let's talk about what my plan does.
what's our four things again?
jobs. Jobs. Man, jobs.
hopefully that won't happen during the debate.
huh?
I don't remember my plan, but it's a really good plan.
it is so good to see you. Now, are you guys like me?
I get nervous at the debates.
Yeah. I hate the debates.
this is big in the campaign, because this is the time for John McCain to try to turn things around. It's his last chance.
again, you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers' living room.
that's absolutely not true.
and the facts are facts.
obama: Let's get the record straight.
Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign.
he has never been involved in this campaign.
and he will not advise me in the White House. So that's Mr. Ayers.
now, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks.
what the American people can't afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies.
and what they deserve is that we talk about what's most pressing to them.
man: How do you feel, Senator?
woman ON TV: On the final day of his historic run for President,
barack Obama got this sad news.
his grandmother had passed away.
this is NPR News.
obama: You know, obviously this is a little bit of a bittersweet time for me.
some of you heard that my grandmother, who helped raise me, passed away early this morning.
man: We love you, brother!
look, she has gone home.
her name was Madelyn Dunham.
she's one of those quiet heroes that we have all across America.
they're not famous.
their names aren't in the newspapers, but each and every day, they work hard.
they look after their families.
they sacrifice for their children and their grandchildren.
they aren't seeking the limelight.
all they try to do is just do the right thing.
and in this crowd, there are a lot of quiet heroes like that.
and that's what America's about.
that's what we're fighting for.
after decades of broken politics in Washington, after eight years of failed policies from George W. Bush...
you don't need to boo. You just need to vote.
after 21 months of a campaign that has taken us from the rocky coasts of Maine to the sunshine of California, we are one day away from changing America.
one day.
tomorrow, at this defining moment in history, you can give this country the change that we need.
you can do this. Right here in North Carolina.
all: Yes, we can.
we will win this general election, you and I together.
we're gonna change this country. We're gonna change the world.
thank you, everybody.
thank you, guys.
all right, Karen, you going to be at the gym tomorrow morning?
Yeah, I appreciate it. Thank you, guys. Thank you.
all right, Jake. My condolences.
Yeah, I appreciate it. Thank you.
all right, guys, appreciate you.
these guys have been carrying all the heavy equipment the whole time.
thank you, guys. And you, too. You don't get enough credit.
thank you. Thank you. All right.
okay, guys, let's take off. Let's go home.
woman: All right.
Hey, how you doing? MAN 1: Well, look at there.
man 2: Hello!
man 1: Scream, but not so loud.
nice to see you.
man 2: You've got the camera on me.
where are the lines, guys?
where are the TV cameras?
Hey, we're that good. We're getting them in and out.
you know, I read the paper this morning, saw what was going on, and as an act of friendship, I voted for McCain.
all set, sir?
Yes, done.
woman: How did that feel?
it felt great.
I think it's the beginning of a long and emotional day.
woman: Today is history. That's what it is. It's history.
when I got in my car and I saw the line, I actually cried.
man: I've never seen this kind of a line here in 20 years, so I'm feeling optimistic.
it's a great sign seeing everybody getting out.
this is the most important election of our life, you know.
this really will determine so many things about our future.
man ON SPEAKERPHONE: ... the next President of the United States of America,
senator Barack Obama.
obama ON SPEAKERPHONE: I wish that my grandmother had been here to see this.
I wish my mother had been here to see it.
they're in a better place now. They're looking down on us.
and, you know, to see my daughters be a part of this...
that's something presumably that they'll never forget.
Michelle seemed to really take a long time deciding who to vote for, for President.
I was a little...
just remember, everybody who's listening, stay in line, don't get discouraged.
man: Hold the line. Hold the line.
obama: Hold the line. All right, bye-bye.
it's going in a circle.
good Lord.
Jim CLYBURN: Usually, I come to this precinct and get in line right around 6... 30, 6... 45, and I'm usually within the first 15 or 20 people to vote.
I understand, at 5... 00 a. m. This morning. Well, people were here standing in line,
my daughter got here at 6: 30, and I think she is...
she's probably gonna be number 200.
winning elections is who has the momentum at the end.
do you feel good about the way you're closing?
I think that we closed well. I think we closed much better than McCain.
but, you know, I'm gonna be nervous.
it's about 11: 40.
and there's big turnout everywhere, just like we expected.
BLAKE: We just got word that Oceola Township and Owen County, that the clerk there is not allowing people to vote if they don't have ID, which obviously is illegal.
Hey, what's new? What do you hear? What do you know?
sounds like Florida's good.
see what happens on Election Day is you just call people saying, "What do you hear? What do you hear?
and nobody actually knows anything, so it's...
MICHELLE: This'll be a long day. Those lines are long.
we want people to hang in there.
we'll be honored and ready to serve.
Katie McCORMICK LELYVELD: Okay. When we come back, we're going to do eight more.
eight more. Yeah.
that's all.
there's no problems discernable anywhere.
the only thing I'm really surprised by is that
pennsylvania black turnout seems low.
young people across the board seems a little low, but I bet that they're outsampled in the early voting.
pennsylvania is the only one that's giving me pause.
I mean, the truth is, when you think about it,
I mean, for all our anxiety and everything else, when you got a black guy named Barack Hussein Obama, how could you lose?
I hate waiting.
I hate it. This has been the longest day of the entire campaign.
GIBBS: Yeah.
if it's possible to feel anxious and calm all in the same breath, that's probably what I'm feeling, with a heavy dose of being very tired.
but we're excited.
we've worked two years for this moment.
it's now in the hands of the voters, and the people of this country.
we have great confidence in that.
Hi, Smiley. I'm so glad you're here.
Meredith TURNER: Twenty months later, it's come down to two hours remaining and you're at a loss.
nowhere to go.
nobody wants me, and nobody needs me anymore.
this would be the last one.
this is my last campaign activity, prior to this evening.
AXELROD: Virginia looks good. Nevada, New Mexico, New Hampshire, lowa, Colorado.
and the only ones that look challenging are Florida, Indiana and Ohio, which is the ones that you would expect.
I mean, North Carolina looks... Where is North Carolina?
if it were here, it'd look really good.
I'm 63 years old. I've been crying since 4: 00 this morning.
this is momentous. Win or lose, the game has been changed.
so FOX thinks we have 291, with Virginia, lowa, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, easy.
well, I'll tell you what.
what I'm really excited about is just to see that turnout all across the country seems to be extraordinary.
and we started this campaign with the idea that the American people are decent and generous, and if we got people participating, that bodes well for the future.
you know, the turnout stuff is really good.
turnout stuff looks very good.
I mean, we still have to open up the fucking votes, but they're voting the way that we think they are.
Yes, and that's it. That's all you need.
that's all you need. Okay.
all right, see you.
wait, what?
wait, what exactly...
is that won?
woman 1: Maybe they'll be leaving...
they just called Ohio, dipshit!
Oh, shit.
woman 2: What?
barack just won Ohio.
man ON TV: We have very important news. Ohio has gone to Obama.
Oh, my God. This thing is over.
they just called Ohio.
they did?
okay, we gotta go to a party or something.
I can't be in here anymore. Just be quiet.
let's get out of here.
all right, look at that. We just whacked 30, 000 off their margin.
we're gonna get your 100, 000.
man ON TV: We're within an hour and a half of polls closing. The people who were not convinced at the 2004 Ohio...
Iowa!
this is Jon. Hey, there. Shut that door.
I can't believe it. It's unbelievable.
it looks really good. You're feeling good?
right now, it is.
AXELROD: Are they calling something?
Pete GIANGRECO: Yeah, they're calling Virginia. What is it, 22?
Hey, can I have a beer?
... strategy of fighting it out on Republican turf is paying off.
we can't say which way these states are going to go, but we can say that by forcing McCain to spend time and money and energy in states like...
AXELROD: Palin is speaking at 11: 00 Eastern.
I wonder if she's communicated this to the McCain people.
man: FOX called Virginia.
we're winning. WOMAN: Amen.
okay. Okay.
and one paragraph up, Axe had one edit.
when it says, "There will be setbacks and false starts,
he has, "There are many who won't agree "with every decision or policy I make "as President, and we know that "government can't solve every problem.
okay.
okay.
that's good? All right. Congratulations.
early, early congratulations.
man: Got a speech. Got a speech!
abc's definitely calling it at 11: 00.
california, yeah?
11: 00 East? 11: 00 East, which is like in five minutes. Five minutes.
that'll be a moment, huh?
Charles GIBSON ON TV: Somebody in the Obama campaign was talking to George and me just the other day and said it was the debates that did it.
now 11: 00 in the East, 8: 00 in the West...
here's history, fellas.
... electoral votes. We will not declare anybody to be President of the United States until he gets over 270, but in just 10 seconds from now, the polls are closing in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and also in the state of Hawaii.
man: When do we hear from California? CROWD: Five, four,
Brian WILLIAMS ON TV: 11: 00 p. m. On the East Coast, and we have news.
barack Obama will be the 44th President of the United States.
Yeah!
Yeah! We won!
all: Obama!
Obama!
all: Yes, we can!
Yes, we can!
I gotta call my mom.
mom...
woman: All right, fellas. MAN: Congratulations.
woman: Don't party too hard. MAN: Congratulations.
all right. Congratulations.
it's actually hard to...
when they say that, man, it's just hard to process.
totally. Yeah, I know.
we've still got some states out.
we'd like to run this margin up a little bit.
security GUARD: Good job, good job!
okay, so now you're gonna work on the next four years afterwards?
AXELROD: Hey, I'm just celebrating tonight.
Hello?
woman ON PHONE: Hi, there. Where are you?
I'm in an elevator. We're going up to see Barack.
okay.
are you okay?
all right, yeah.
okay, we'll be over there soon.
okay.
man: What's this?
3607?
Yep.
excuse me, do you have a heart pin?
woman: If I ask, will you guys give me one.
PLOUFFE: Looks like a party.
man: Just down to your right.
how are you? Hi.
all right, come on in, guys.
Congratulations.
thank you, thank you.
unbelievable.
Thanks. Well done.
a long two years.
woman: Yeah, a long two years.
they in there?
Yeah, come on in. The Bidens just went in.
man: Congrats.
man 2: Good talking to you, and looking forward to seeing you, buddy.
congratulations to you. Okay, thanks a lot. Bye.
don't start crying. Don't do it.
don't do it. I've already been crying.
okay, sir, well, I know you are.
the President-elect is definitely looking forward to speaking with the Prime Minister.
unfortunately, currently right now, he's unavailable.
but what I will do is somebody will reach out to you very soon to try to arrange a time for the President-elect to speak with you.
they were like, "That was okay.
obama: All right, guys, let's do this.
they said this day would never come.
man: Yes, we can!
obama: They said our sights were set too high.
but on this January night, at this defining moment in history, you have done what the cynics said we couldn't do.
this land is your land This land is my land From California to the New York Island From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters This land was made for you and me As I was walking A ribbon of highway I saw above me the endless sky I saw below me a golden valley This land was made for you and me This land is your land This land is my From California to the New York Island From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters This land was made for you and me I roamed and rambled And I followed my footsteps To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts And all around me A voice was sounding This land was made for you and me
and so, heh... Heh.
I chose jellyfish as my favorite...
you all fed? Yeah?
yeah...
man: Marcy! Marcy May!
where are you going?
WATTS: Marcy, what are you doing here?
worried about you.
well, I'm fine.
yeah? And Patrick is worried about you.
I just wanted to come into town.
Oh, I could have given you a ride.
I wanted to walk.
through the woods?
can I get you something?
no, thank you.
are you done?
Yeah. Uh...
you're not gonna finish that?
okay, thanks.
ready to go?
not right now.
no?
Hey, don't do that. Come here.
you're shaking.
calm down.
all right. You take care of yourself.
Hello?
Hello?
Martha? Yeah.
where are you? Where have you been?
uh, I'm not sure. I'm upstate, I think.
you're in New York?
Yeah, I think.
when did you get back?
how long have you been here?
Martha?
Martha, what's wrong?
I don't know. Um...
I should go back.
go back where?
Martha, what happened? Are you okay?
um, I have to go. Um...
I can't stay gone, so...
no, no, no, don't go.
what are you talking about?
Martha.
I'm sorry for calling.
please don't hang up. Don't hang up the phone.
find out where you are and I will come get you.
Martha? I can't wait that long.
what do you mean? Tell me where you are and I will come right now.
no, it's okay, you don't have to.
Martha, I wanna see you. Please.
Martha?
Martha.
I made you some tea. Thanks.
you're dripping everywhere.
Ted should be up from the city soon, make us some dinner.
I'm pretty tired.
is it okay if I just go to bed?
sure.
get a good night's sleep tonight and you'll be as good as new tomorrow.
well? She seems okay.
what did she say? Not much.
she's really tired.
yeah? Yeah.
Where's she been?
she had some boyfriend. They were living in the Catskills.
what? It's okay.
heh, it's not really, Lucy. It's fine.
she's here now.
how long is she gonna be staying again? Ha-ha-ha!
TED: Oh, Martha.
welcome. Hi.
great to finally meet you. Yeah.
did you sleep all right? Mm-hm.
good.
so how do you like our house?
it's nice.
it's just a rental. Yeah, well, I love it.
I didn't know there was a lake. Mm. Yeah.
do you still like to swim?
you don't still live in the city? TED & LUCY: Heh, heh.
we do. We just like to come up here on weekends and holidays.
you know. Ted is working on this new building downtown...
and as soon as it's finished...
we're taking one of the apartments. Do you wanna see pictures?
do you think she's excited to have you back?
this is just the view, and obviously the interiors aren't finished...
but it's nice, right? MARTHA: Mm-hm.
we were supposed to move in in the spring...
but, uh, construction was halted, so it's gonna be just a little while longer.
Yes, just a little while longer. Okay, sorry, no more work talk.
aren't you hungry?
not really, sorry. Well, you have to eat something.
it's okay, I can make you something later.
where are we?
Connecticut.
well, how far are we?
from what? Yesterday.
you mean from where I picked you up?
about three hours. Why?
I was just wondering.
put out your cigarette. Why?
just do it.
is that him? Yeah.
Hey.) '...
PATRICK: Is this Martha?
Hi.
how you doing? Great.
Oh, you've got a really nice place here.
it's as much yours as it is mine.
I thought you quit. I did.
I worry for you.
I know.
I'm sorry.
don't apologize to me. It's your body.
Zoe, look after this girl.
for once in her life, she deserves some real care.
I will.
she's been great.
everyone's been really great. Good.
Martha.
you look like a Marcy May.
Marcy was my grandmother's name.
wow, there you go. Heh.
TED: I'm going in. Do you wanna join'?
sure.
you coming? In a minute.
Martha!
that is an interesting choice of swim wear.
Martha, get out of the water.
what? LUCY: Get out of the water.
why aren't you wearing any clothes? What is wrong with you?
you can't do that around here, you know. Why?
because there are kids around. People come by.
so? You just can't, okay? Get out of the water.
we don't do that kind of thing. Get out.
you could have asked me. I have a bathing suit you could borrow.
what's wrong with you? Jesus.
Hey, hey, Marcy.
Max. MAX: Hey.
where do they go at night? Uh...
Pfft! I don't know. Heh. I never get invited.
you wanna have a drink with me?
they won't be back for a few hours.
I shouldn't. I'm not gonna drink for a while, actually. I think it's a good idea for me.
all right.
wake up, everybody.
good morning.
we switch out jobs each day so we all know how to do different things.
do you knit? No.
I can learn, though. Oh, no, that's okay.
you'll find your role.
it takes time for people to find their role in a new family.
mostly, we sell blankets in town because we still need some money.
but once the farm is up and running, we'll be self-sufficient...
and we'll never have to worry about it again.
Hey. I'm sorry, Patrick. Hey.
PATRICK: What are you sorry for'? Ahem.
um, here.
how are you, man?
good, you?
feels like...
it's a really great consistency. ZOE: Yeah, and it's sticky.
and it holds together like glue.
and it can flow around. Like... WATTS: You should talk to her.
that's why I need to figure out how to do it.
Yeah.
Yeah, you'll figure it out. Don't look...
PATRICK: How's everything going so far, Marcy May?
good. PATRICK: Do you like it here?
Yeah, it's... It's great.
PATRICK: I want you to feel at home.
I do, thank you. PATRICK: Mm-hm.
I know people have abandoned you your whole life.
your father. What?
I don't blame you for not trusting people.
but if you're ever going to have a meaningful relationship...
you need to let your guard down.
it's not your fault, but it's there.
and if you feel safe here, and I hope you do, let us in.
we wanna help you.
Yeah. We think you're fucking awesome.
PATRICK: But if you're gonna live here...
you need to be a part of things.
play another song.
man: Do "A Patch of Land." It's not a song.
good morning. Good morning.
how are you feeling today? Good.
yeah? Good.
so, uh, I stopped by the juice place and I got you a kale with ginseng.
do you mind just putting your feet off the counter?
I got you a kale and ginseng because it's just...
I don't know, I thought it might make you feel better.
if that doesn't appeal to you, I also got a pineapple orange.
Yeah, that might be better. Thank you. Okay.
Oh, and I also got you protein bars, just in case you want a snack.
why is the house so big?
the house isn't so big.
it's big for two people.
well, yeah, but we like to entertain.
and sometimes friends come up for the weekend...
sometimes we have parties. It's just nice to have space.
so no one else lives here?
of course no one else lives here.
you're married? Yeah.
when? April.
I tried calling you, but, uh, apparently you got rid of your cell phone.
I lost it.
you didn't think to get a new one? I got used to not having one.
TED: Cocktails, anyone? No, thank you.
Martha? Mm-mm.
was it a big wedding? About 40 people.
mostly Ted's family.
did Aunt Dora come? Ha, yes.
did she smoke like a chimney and complain about everything?
she's not that bad. You didn't have to live with her.
TED: You lived with Dora?
she lived with me after Mom died.
and where were you? LUCY: College.
LUCY: She'd love to know you're okay. MARTHA: She hates me.
LUCY: She does not hate you.
look at me. Come on. MARTHA: Mm-mm.
no. LUCY: I don't have any pictures of you.
God, you're gorgeous.
it's really rather irritating.
there you go.
you don't need to shake it. That's a myth.
is it true married people don't fuck? LUCY: What?
no, heh.
excuse me.
put this on. You're kidding.
your clothes are disgusting. Try it. Why does it matter?
because it feels good to put on something nice and comfortable.
it looks really good on you, you little shit.
whatever makes you happy, mama bear.
you're making fun of me, and I think it looks really good on you.
what, its not good? No, no, it's fine.
uh, it's a bit dry. It's not dry.
it just needs a little bit more salt, that's all.
she seems better today. Yeah.
I wish I didn't have to go tomorrow.
well, let me take you. No.
I don't want her to be alone.
you'll be nice to her, right?
I'm always nice. Oh.
I know you feel like something bad just happened, Marcy May.
but you have to trust me, that wasn't bad.
that was truly good.
we've all been in this situation.
we wouldn't all still be here if what happened in that room was bad.
we all love each other very much.
we're all together on this.
you have to trust us.
do you believe me?
Yeah.
you're so lucky.
I'd give anything to have my first time again.
Really? Yeah.
it's so special.
I can't remember anything.
I just woke up and felt this pain.
that's the cleansing.
it's good. It means it's working if you can't remember things.
you're cleansing yourself of the past and the toxins.
you need to share yourself.
don't be selfish.
I'm not.
so smile, then.
enjoy this amazing night. It only happens once.
Thanks.
is that a new one, Max? There's one right there.
Yeah. Is that a new song?
Yeah, I wrote it yesterday.
that was the first half. Great.
that was nice. Thanks, man.
all right. This is called "Marcy's Song.
[SINGING] Well, she's
she's just a picture
who lives
lives on my wall
well, she's
she's just a picture
the reason, reason, reason it is so small
the smile's so inviting
Ana' her body so rah'
well, she's
she's just a picture
just a picture
that's all
well, you stand there
stand there with the nightshade
her dripping
dripping down your hands
you ask me
ask me about the lightning
the lady, lady, lady, she understands
so dream for the future
water for the sand
and the strangeness is wandering
through many calling lands
TED: You've been saying the same thing to me for two months...
and I still don't have them.
I'm going into the meeting in 14 fucking days.
great. No, that's all I wanted to hear. Thank you.
what are you doing? Cleaning.
I thought I'd help out more.
all right.
Ahh. I'm gonna take the boat out. Do you wanna come'?
is Lucy coming?
uh, no, she had to run to the city. Oh.
come on, I'll teach you how to drive the boat.
it's okay.
come on.
sorry.
it's going, it's going, it's going.
okay. Okay. All right.
okay. All right. Okay.
want one?
Yeah.
how's it been with Lucy? Fine.
is it strange to spend time together? No. Why?
it's been a long time.
I don't know. It's normal, I guess.
where is she?
she's at the doctor.
Why? Getting a checkup.
we are trying to have a baby.
what? I just can'! imagine it.
Lucy holding a baby.
Why?
well, she wouldn't know what to do with it.
do you want a baby?
if she's happy, I'm happy.
so you're unhappy?
what, now? Ha-ha-ha.
no, no, no, she's doing well.
she's doing well.
do you want another?
here.
she is, um, relieved to have you back.
you know, you worried her.
Why? Because you disappeared.
you hadn't called in two years.
I just lost track, I guess.
well, it's a good thing to let people know where you are, Martha.
people worry.
I didn't think Lucy would worry about me. Well, she did.
can I go swimming?
Hey, you don't need to ask.
TED: Jesus Christ. LUCY: What?
Martha, what are you doing? MARTHA: Nothing.
LUCY: Jesus. You can't just come in here like that.
sorry.
goddamn it, what's wrong?
I'm just having a hard time sleeping alone.
all you do is sleep. Christ.
just stay. Stay.
why would you think it was okay to come in here like that?
I don't know. it's a big bed. You guys were on the other side.
you can't come into our room when we're having sex.
that's not normal. It's private. Sorry.
you don't need to apologize. Just...
I need you to understand why it's not okay.
okay.
do you? Yeah.
well? Because it's private and not normal.
LUCY: Oh, God.
just lie down, Martha.
TED: Oh, this is just brilliant. LUCY: Don't go.
just go to sleep.
LUCY: I'm sorry you slept out here.
thank you for being patient.
TED: I didn't have much choice, did I?
LUCY: I'm just trying to make sure she's okay.
I have two weeks a year to come up here...
and try to relax. I know.
I'm under pressure... I know you are.
to get this building up and running or the bank takes it.
that has nothing to do with Martha.
no, I guess my point is, I just don't need the extra stress.
I'm her only family.
you know, she needs to know that she can depend on me right now.
it's complicated. TED: As complicated as it might be...
we can't ignore the fact that her behavior is fucking insane.
I'm sorry.
MARTHA: Hey.
do you ever hear things hit the roof at night?
no.
maybe it's pinecones?
where did you pick up gardening?
there was a garden where I lived.
you're good. I'm good at some things.
I know you are.
was he ever physical with you?
who? Your boyfriend.
what do you mean?
did he ever hit you?
no.
you had a bruised ear...
and when you called me, you were hysterical.
I never noticed.
are you sure he didn't hit you? Yeah.
you can tell me.
he never hit me.
I wish you felt more comfortable talking to me.
I do. So talk.
there's nothing to talk about.
I had a boyfriend, he lied to me, I left. That's it.
not everything has to be a big deal.
Hey, don't stare. PATRICK: No.
no.
you okay? Yeah.
he's right. I don't know why I'm so weak.
you're not.
you'll quit.
who's that?
her name is Sarah, I think.
you should handle her.
you think? Yeah, you're ready.
Zoe can help, but you'll be great.
Jesus.
WATTS: Hey, guys. Hi.
Katie, this is Sarah. Hi, Sarah.
Zoe and Marcy May.
MARTHA: We share all this. So if it fits, you can wear it.
cool.
and this is where we sleep.
you can take any bed that's open or, uh, you can sleep downstairs.
I'm hungry. Can we eat? We don't eat until the evening.
Really? You'll get used to it.
your body doesn't need that much food.
he's beautiful.
who's the mother? Katie.
but we all help out.
is Patrick the father? Uh-huh.
come here. Oh, yeah.
looks just like him. Oh, oh.
all the kids here are boys.
he only has boys.
you're good with him. Do you wanna hold him?
no. I don't... I don't have to take care of them, do I?
no, not if you don't want to.
there are plenty of jobs you can do.
you'll find your role.
it takes time to find your role in a new family, huh?
I called my dad today to ask for money.
does Patrick know?
Yeah, he asked me to.
sometimes if there's something we need, I'll call.
well, how was it? Fine. They're not bad people.
did he give you the money?
Yeah. He thinks I'm on drugs.
did you tell him that you're not?
no, that's why he gives it to me.
I guess he'd rather pay for it than think I'm sucking dick for it.
I've done drugs.
not a lot, but I tried pretty much everything.
except heroin.
it's good to try everything at least once. You find out who you are.
what about drinking? Do you drink? No.
I have, but I don't.
good. We don't drink. It makes you angry and less focused.
don't get the wrong idea, Sarah. We don't really talk to our old families.
I wouldn't call my dad anyway- PATRICK: Marcy.
Hey, have you met Sarah?
Sally, yeah.
that's enough.
half. Half is fine.
okay.
excuse me.
I can finish this if you wanna go to bed.
I don't mind.
why don't you get some sleep? Okay.
Hi.
What...? What do I have to do?
nothing you don't want to.
drink this, it will help you relax. Thanks.
it's herbal. It starts the cleansing.
we've all done it so there's nothing to worry about.
why do I have to wear this robe? Heh.
I know it's a bit silly but it's just part of it.
Oh, my God. You look amazing.
Thanks.
you know, this is your special night with him.
enjoy it.
you'll be great.
Yeah.
I don't feel well.
MARTHA: It's okay, just lie down.
shouldn't I start cooking?
well, I just made a salad and Ted is cooking the fish.
I thought we were going to cook. We cooked last night.
Oh, yeah.
do you ever have that feeling where you can't tell if something is a memory...
or if it's something you dreamed?
not really. No.
do you blame me for anything?
no.
like what?
I don't know.
I'm trying to figure out why we stopped talking.
I don't really think about it.
Really? Well, we were far apart.
sometimes I wonder if maybe I couldn't have taken better care of you.
the past doesn't matter. It does matter.
well, I took care of myself.
I know you did, but sometimes I think I could've done more.
stop.
you really never think about it? No.
you're not angry with me? God, I know you don't think much of me...
but I knew what I was doing then and I still do.
no, Martha, I think the world of you.
sometimes I just think I should have come home...
and made sure you went to college.
you had so much potential. I don't need your guidance now...
and I didn't then. I am a teacher and a leader.
you just never let me be that. But now, I am... I know who I am.
a teacher and a leader?
what are you talking about?
I am always... TED: Dinner's ready!
I was the one who encouraged you to push yourself, always.
you were the one who shut me out.
Martha... Just because we're sisters...
doesn't mean we need to talk about everything that comes into your head.
TED: Dinner's ready.
come on, don't be rude.
so, what are your plans, Martha?
for what?
TED: Um, life.
I don't know.
TED: Are you thinking about what you could do for a job?
no.
you're at an age when you need to start thinking about a proper career.
Why?
it is a part of adult life.
there are other ways to live.
Really? Sure.
like what?
I don't know.
people don't need careers. People should just exist.
he's just saying we should start talking about what you are interested in.
we can come up with some ideas that we can put together...
but there are moments in my life when I would love to just go to France and exist.
you can do that if you want to. TED: It is not that simple.
you know, it's not your fault, but you learned to measure success...
by money and possessions.
it's just not the right way to live.
it's not the right way to live?
what is the right way to live exactly?
Martha, what is the right way to live? Hm?
is it, um, vanishing off the face of the earth, not calling your family for two years...
or until they're worried sick, is that the right way to live?
or is it living without possessions until you need someone...
and then turning up on our doorstep...
where you know you can get some? Is that the right way to live? No, no.
you sit there, lecturing us about our lives.
and so far, I have not witnessed one sign that you have any values of your own.
you should remember that you are living under my roof.
you are eating my food and you should watch your mouth...
because you are rude. You don't know anything about it.
woman [OVER PHONE]: Hello?
Hello?
who's this?
who's this?
Zoe?
is she not there?
she's not.
where is she?
who is this?
who's this?
Marlene Lewis.
who's this?
Marcy?
woman 1: Steal.
woman 2: Have you seen my brother?
he's got really red hair and a bunch of freckles.
woman 1: Good job.
very nice. WATTS: Hey.
let's mind our own beeswax, huh? Heh, okay.
I'm seriously the best one at this and no one will out-fast my hands.
Yes. Oh, God.
Oh, God, you are so hot when you shoot.
you know that? This just makes my willy hard.
get off me. Thank you. I'm set.
all right, Marcy, let's have fun.
make sure your knees are smooth and loose...
and your heart is in the right place. Max, is this just an excuse to grape Marcy?
I'm teaching her how to shoot, okay?
and then you just squeeze.
Hi, Patrick. Nice shot.
focus.
take a deep breath.
feel the tension leaving your stomach and moving to your hands.
think of someone who hurt you, who lied to you. Feel it.
feel how they made you feel.
let it build.
let it transfer to the gun.
building in the gun.
breathe out.
release.
feels good, right? Yeah.
now try that.
what do you mean? Shoot it.
they're living animals. So shoot Max then.
Yeah, go ahead. Let's get it up.
breathe.
go on. MAX: All right, fuck this.
don't walk away from me, Max.
the cat has terminal cancer.
it's in excruciating pain. MARTHA: I can't.
you know, Max has no substance.
he's just here to freeload, be around the girls.
but you're different.
you're a teacher and a leader.
you don't see it because no one let you believe it.
you're a teacher and a leader, Marcy. Now prove it.
that cat reminds you of some fluffy thing you think you used to love.
you're clinging to some misguided emotion.
so I could spend my life being selfish, living alone and using this gift for me...
but I've sacrificed in order to be what you need me to be.
why don't you trust me? I do.
then you shouldn't need me to explain everything.
PATRICK: Why...? Why did you do that?
you said it was sick.
PATRICK: One of them was sick. Zoe knew which one it was.
sorry.
PATRICK: Try again?
my sweetheart
come here.
ready.
aim.
you shouldn't smoke. What?
I don't smoke. Especially if you're trying to have a kid.
maybe you should mind your own business.
I can't deal with talking to anybody right now.
press them together.
I think that's better.
you look really pretty.
Thanks.
um, everybody, I want you to meet my sister. This is Martha.
man 2: That was very cool. What's your name?
I'm sorry?
what's your name? Uh...
I'm Mike.
um, can I get you something to drink?
I used to drink this.
okay. Straight?
I thought you're not supposed to drink, Mike.
I'm not drinking.
you think you're so fucking smart.
LUCY: Martha.
Martha, are you all right?
Hey. Hey, what is going on? He's a fucking liar!
who? We have to leave.
okay, hey. Listen to me. What's going on? We all have to leave. I know him.
go into our room. What's this?
we have to leave. You don't wanna live with this.
Martha, get into my room.
TED: Let's go into the bedroom. LUCY: Please.
what is wrong with you? You're not listening to me.
I am. I don't know who you're talking about.
he's fucking here! All right, take it...
MARTHA: Please don't touch me! You're not listening to me!
come on. LUCY: Take a deep breath.
MARTHA: Stop! Take a deep breath.
take a deep breath. MARTHA: Let go of me.
Martha, take a deep breath. No. No.
what is going on? I have no idea.
Martha, take a deep breath. Come on.
you're all right. You're all right.
Martha, please try to breathe. Please try to breathe.
can you tell me what you're talking about? I don't know what you're talking about.
please try to breathe.
there you go.
there you go. Okay.
okay. Okay, look at me.
Hi. Hey. MAN: What the fuck?
we can go.
what do you want?
nothing.
no, there's no need for that.
um, we're leaving now.
so come on, guys.
sorry.
Jesus Christ. PATRICK: Calm down.
if you calm down, no one will get hurt.
what do you want?
we don't want anything.
get out. We were looking at the house. It's nice.
we wouldn't have come in if we knew you were here.
just leave.
I would, but I can't be sure you won't call the police.
I won't.
you didn't take anything? Mm-mm.
so just go.
I just want to make sure my family is safe. Safe?
why wouldn't anyone be safe?
unless you call the police, everything will be fine.
I won't.
I give you my word, so please go.
get the fuck out of my house.
Marcy, go now.
PATRICK: I got it.
go on.
WATTS: All right.
Oh, fuck.
LUCY: Hey.
Martha.
Hey, I made you some tea.
Thanks, Mom.
if it's too hot, you can just blow on it, okay?
sorry I ruined the party.
you didn't ruin the party. It's fine.
is it over? Mm-hm.
you slept through the night.
that's good.
do you wanna try to sit up and drink the tea?
no, I don't need it.
PATRICK: You okay? MARTHA: Mm-hm.
you know that death...
is the most beautiful part of life, right?
death is beautiful because we all fear death.
and fear is the most amazing emotion of all because it creates complete awareness.
it brings you to now...
and that makes you truly present.
and when you're truly' present, that's nirvana.
that's pure love.
so death is pure love.
Hello? WOMAN: Hi, is Watts there?
who is this? Jane. Is Watts there?
can I help you? Who is this?
Marlene Lewis.
what's your last name, Jane?
Heller. Sorry, do I have the right number?
I don't know. Do you?
it's a Jane. What?
Jane.
Hello?
Hey, how are you?
uh, sure, let's do it. I'll be around there on Friday.
no, that was my cousin Marlene.
okay, sure.
all right, I'll see you then. I'm glad you called.
all right. Bye.
hey...
Marcy.
we don't eat until they're finished.
you know better.
I know. Sorry, Katie.
LUCY: Who's Katie? MARTHA: What?
why don't you go sit down and I'll finish this?
what's going on? Who the fuck knows?
she needs to see someone. I know.
okay. I'll start looking into places tomorrow.
places?
I don't think she should stay with us any more.
we can't do anything for her when she's like this.
LUCY: I don't wanna talk about it any more, okay?
Zoe.
ZOE: Yeah?
I can't stop thinking about that man.
I know.
it just happens, though.
we're never really dead or alive.
we just exist.
so he's still existing, but it's in a parallel time.
just don't think about it.
WATTS: Patrick?
yes?
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt...
but I've heard some of the girls talking outside.
ZOE: It's Zoe. Can we talk?
will you let me in?
get over it. You haven't learned anything.
I have. I thought we had a connection.
we do. Show me.
maybe I asked too much from you too soon.
I'll expect less of you from now on, okay?
I'm sorry. No, no, no. Shh.
you're my favorite...
and I won't lose you.
TED: Martha.
Martha.
Martha.
TED: Oh, fuck.
LUCY: Are you all right? TED: Fuck. Yes.
Jesus. What happened? She kicked me down the stairs.
she what? She kicked me down the fucking stairs!
Christ! I mean, what is it gonna fucking take, Lucy?
LUCY: What the fuck is wrong with you?
I was confused. About what?
what are you confused about? I thought he was someone else.
you thought he was someone else? What the fuck is wrong with you?
I'm not doing this any more. Okay, I'm not gonna do this any more.
I have beat myself up over you for years and I am sick of it.
I am sick of chasing you down and worrying about you.
I'm sorry.
you need help, Martha. I know.
what happened to you?
what happened? I don't know!
we're gonna get you some proper help.
are you gonna send me away?
I don't know how to help you
please don't. Please. I can't help you, Martha.
please, I can't be alone. Please.
LUCY: No.
no.
we're trying to have a family and I don't feel safe with you here.
MARTHA: Lucy. What?
what?
you're gonna be a terrible mother.
do you have any money left?
no?
no, I didn't think you did.
we'll make sure everything is taken care of.
LUCY: Hey.
you're going swimming? Yeah.
it's a bit chilly.
I don't mind.
I think we both said some things last night that we didn't mean.
Yeah.
we scheduled an appointment for you for tomorrow morning.
what's it like there?
it looks nice.
it's not that far from us.
we head back to the city in about an hour.
you're gonna be ready, right? Yeah.
TED: What the hell is he doing?
fucking lunatic.
LUCY: God. Are you okay? TED: Yeah, I'm fine.
LUCY: He just came out of nowhere.
this is rehab, okay?
I got to tell you all the bad shit I did.
so, uh, what? You hocked everything.
is that it?
the Cartier love bracelet,
the Venetian glass we got on our honeymoon...
Hey, I didn't sell that ceramic bowl that they gave us as a wedding present.
Oh, well.
I-I made that for you.
I know. It's special as shit to me.
that's for you, by the way. I made it in art therapy.
Really? Mm-hmm.
you're welcome. - Thank you.
I will, uh... treasure it always.
Jesus Christ! Marce! Is there more?
is that it? what?
just the thing with the waiter at the airport chili's.
Marcy!
I need to fess up, okay? It's part of the process.
there was just a little bit of tongue.
I was gonna get on the plane to see my mother -- I swear.
but the guy had some blow. One thing lead to another...
we made out a little.
enough. You know, just -- just stop, okay?
I mean, if I were doing anything like that, you wouldn't want to hear about it, would you?
you absolutely would not want to know something like that.
well, I wouldn't say absolutely.
and y-you were doing something like that.
remember? With Dani? You did.
you went off the deep end, and what did I do, Runkle?
I stood by you. I forgave your ass.
and that's what he's doing. I mean, he's here.
he's standing by you.
you know, this is gonna be rough, honey.
you're just in the first week.
but you guys, you're gonna get through this.
Yeah, you're gonna be stronger in the places that are broken.
like Hemingway said.
I don't know what I'd do without you guys.
well, fortunately, you will never have to find out.
we should go, give them some space.
okay. Adieu, cokie smurf.
you look much better without that giant monkey on your back.
Mnh-mnh. Not good enough.
what? You want tongue?
I want everybody in. Come on, you two.
literally? like a group hug?
Yes. Please?
all right.
Oh, yeah. That's right. Feel the love.
I'm feeling the love.
the love is strong.
I'm feeling something poking me on my left is what I'm feeling.
I got a bro-ner.
watch and learn.
are you, uh, swinging on the exhale or the inhale?
Oh, you hooked it.
eh. Gator ball.
a little hook.
okay, if I hit one ball way the fuck over into houdini's front yard, then you have to tell me, right?
everything Janie said about you? - Yeah.
no way. I don't interview and tell.
hook! - Captain hook.
come on, Moody. It's my fuckin' life.
no, not anymore it's not. It's my book.
besides, I'm not wagering on this game.
you invented it.
you made up all the bullshit rules.
run, you cunt!
Ooh, that was all right. It came back.
kind of a metaphor for life, isn't it, lad?
Yeah, it's Ashby's world. We all just live in it.
come on. I've been good lately. I haven't seen Mia once.
she's been busy doing, uh, publicity for this, uh, book she wrote.
what is that -- a memoir or something?
or something.
come on, give me a little something for good behavior!
all right! I can't tell you how I know this, but the Beverly hills husband -- definitely cheating.
no shit. I'll know more when I see her tonight.
you're gonna see her tonight?
it's, uh... Friday night. - Yeah.
you can't see her tonight.
that -- that's weird. It's like a...a date.
what -- two people of the opposite gender can't rendezvous after 7: 00 p. m?
it's automatically a date?
in Ashby's world.
I like that.
no, Marcy's still out of town,
but I could squeeze you in with Oxsana Tuesday at 4: 00.
okay. Great. We'll see you then. Bye.
how's the patient?
requiring all my patience.
listen, Daisy, I can't thank you enough for filling in like this.
eh! No problem. It's fun.
fun?
rescheduling all Marcy's appointments, dealing with angry clients...hey, it's a lot easier than getting cum shot in your eye and pretending to like it.
and all week long I've kind of felt special, you know, like one of those girls in the movies who works in an office.
like "the devil wears prada" or something.
Yeah, well, those girls all generally get paid.
I am not helping out around here to get paid.
you guys took me in.
you made me a part of your family.
well, I don't know if "family" is the right word.
Oh, you mean 'cause of our lengthy...
don't worry. I get it.
I...know it's never gonna happen again.
you do?
Yeah!
don't sweat it. I'm already looking for a new place to live.
well, you know, the guest room is yours until you
Oh, excuse me.
glamorous and important work to do.
you Karen?
who's askin'?
I work for Lew Ashby.
you're a long way from Laurel Canyon.
here.
what? what is that?
it just says "get in the car."
he's not one for words.
we'll have you back by 11: 00.
back from where? what the
I can't say exactly.
but I can say it's supremely awesome.
you honestly expect me to get in that car with you?
what? you got something else to do?
it's Friday night.
come on.
okay.
you sure about this?
we could always grab a box of their best chardonnay
and drink it at the bus stop.
you promised that you would take me anywhere I wanted to go tonight.
well, I did, and I meant it.
but I was thinking more like burgers at the apple pan.
Oh, so you're a cheap date.
just because two people of the opposite gender rendezvous after 7: 00 p. m.
doesn't necessarily make it a date.
I think Lew would disagree with you on that.
he has. yeah.
so he knows we're out tonight?
she asked
because she obviously still gives a damn.
what about you, your husband?
where does the one that you gave your troth to
where does he think you are tonight?
he took the kids to Legoland for the weekend.
Legoland!
Legoland. Okay. All right.
Plus, he feels Venice is too dangerous.
he doesn't like to come here.
well, in your case, he may be right.
look at this monstrosity.
Oh, I like this one.
you do?!
Yeah, it looks how I feel.
what's that -- alienated?
nauseous? Culturally dispossessed?
no.
cheese cube. - Hank?
Hank, are you -- are you okay? Is he okay?
it just went down the wrong pipe.
cheese cube.
Hi. I'm Janie.
Hi. Sonja.
Oh, Sonja. When are you due?
Oh, god. Six more weeks.
well, you look great. - Thank you so much.
so how do you two know each other?
look who's here.
look at that. the...
Oh, yeah.
sonja and I, we have no secrets.
uh, yeah, Hank is the father.
alleged father... of sonja's bump.
okay.
it's nice that you're here.
I never thought you'd be, you know, at a place like this.
I didn't. This is Julian's gallery.
Oh, no, I did not know that.
okay, and now that you do,
you're never gonna get down here again, will you?
probably not.
slippery -- slippery guy, this one.
Oh, very slippery, yeah. Who's Julian?
Julian self, the -- the artist within.
there he is.
salvador Dal? Yeah.
Oh, my god! Look at that.
I-I-I -- you know what? I knew it.
look how late it is.
you know, we're -- we're, uh, hopping from gallery to gallery tonight.
"gallery-hopping" I think they call it.
and we've got another thing to get to.
I don't think we have another thing.
Oh, no, we do.
no, no, you can't go. You cannot
you cannot leave without saying hello to Julian.
no, I think we can. We could.
you promised we could do anything I wanted tonight.
I did? That doesn't sound like me.
lead the way, Sonja.
you don't know me well enough to torture me in this fashion.
shit, Marcy!
all the petty cash, too?
Oh, hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry.
um, listen.
look, I know it probably took a lot of courage just to walk in here, but actually we're closed.
in fact, we don't really even, you know, do men.
is Daisy here?
Ddaisy. No, listen, pal. No Marce's appointments today.
okay? I just -- I forgot to lock the door is all.
Oh, um... we're going out.
on a date?
Yeah.
you look amazing.
you do! you look
I was just meeting your friend.
I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.
Oh, Steve, this is my boss, Charlie Runkle.
nice to meet you, Steve.
nice to meet you.
So...have you got a job, Steve?
some means of support?
Oh, yeah, of course.
um, I work across the street at the sharper image.
sharper image.
you know, if you're not done with work, I can just wait for you outside if you'd like.
Oh, that would be great. Okay.
seems nice.
don't you mean "boring as shit"?
thanks for covering for me, by the way.
we both know I'm not really the girl who works at the front desk.
Hey, hey. Sure you are. You're any girl you want to be.
you know, I don't have to go out with this guy.
he asked, and I figured "what the hell do something normal for a change."
but I could tell him something came up with work
and stay... help you with the books.
Yeah, because that wouldn't be at all dysfunctional.
no, no, you should go.
you know, you should go out tonight
on a normal date with a normal guy
because you're young and normal.
and that's what normal people normally do.
okay.
don't work too hard.
don't you fuck him too hard.
just in time.
Hey. I had no idea they, um, they started so promptly.
I mean, "Lili Haydn, the Hollywood bowl, 8: 30."
I take it you don't like the crowds.
I have, uh, issues.
Oh, you do?
So...you think you might stay?
I might. I mean, it's a beautiful evening, right?
where are we gonna sit?
maybe we can squeeze up front. I know people.
okay.
so do you use flavored wax for this or just, like, surfboard wax?
do you know what hospital you're going to
Oh, god, no.
you know what? No. No hospitals.
we're having home water birth.
eases the birth trauma.
and, um, it's, uh, much more sensual for a woman.
it facilitates the birth orgasm.
Hey, so -- so in a pool this is gonna happen? yeah.
so you're not expecting so much a boy or girl as a sea-monkey.
Hank.
amphibious.
it's actually -- it's a boy.
we have a home ultrasound machine.
we do it every week.
did I forget to tell you about that?
about the home ultrasound machine?
Yes, but I -- of course I assumed you had one.
doesn't everybody? I know I do.
Hank hasn't always been so involved in all this pregnancy stuff.
and that is a choice that Hank will live to regret.
Jane, have you, uh, experienced giving birth?
Yes, uh-huh. Yes, I have.
ahh, but you haven't experienced a birth orgasm, have you?
no, I did not. mnh-mnh.
maybe you should let Julian do a reading for you.
he can gauge your negativity.
no, I'm good.
I think he's gauging it right now.
no, I think we're good. No, we have to get going.
we have that next thing. What thing?
you don't want to stay and hear more about the birth orgasm?
Jane... what?
you have very beautiful eyes. I do?
Yes, and whatever pain you have experienced in this life you've obviously transcended.
Uh-huh. Are you menstruating right now?
am i...menstruating?
and we're done.
all right. Well, that was a good time.
Hank, Hank, come on. Don't go. We're having fun.
I mean, he didn't mean it. It wasn't sexual.
of course it's sexual.
there's nothing wrong with expressing a healthy, respectful, interested, someone else sexual reality.
see, I'm married, so...
Oh, now you're married.
I am. I'm married.
I think that he's suggesting group sex.
I mean, that's what you're suggesting, right?
by all means. I mean, look at us.
the four of us have this incredible pansexual chemistry.
you go. I'm gonna take a bullet for you.
don't resist.
Yeah, you know what?
I just want it so bad. I'm just not ready.
I'm not ready. I'm not ready.
I'll see you soon, okay?
what the fuck was that?
I like him.
Hey. Daisy, you're back.
Yeah, I was just in the neighborhood.
I don't understand. is your date over already?
not exactly. I kind of blew it off.
Daisy!
I know! I know!
highly dysfunctional.
but, you see, I forgot something.
what's that?
just how much I love "dirty dancing."
friends don't let friends wallow...
at least not alone.
so what do you say, Charlie Runkle?
are you ready to have the time of your life?
it is not every day that you meet a man who has impregnated a cult member.
well, there were a lot of controlled substances involved.
it was only the one time, so...
Wow. So your boys are potent?
they were -- I've been snipped, vasectomized, had my testes done.
Wow. That is some excellent foreplay.
you like that? That's my "a" material.
at the end of the night, I just come right out and announce my infertility.
it's sexy.
Yeah, it's working for you, huh?
it is. It really turns a girl on.
Oh, hey, that reminds me. I've got something of yours.
You...left something at my place.
Oh. Your notebook.
well, I hope you filled in all the blanks for me.
Nah, I figured you could do that,
maybe follow me back to my place?
for the proverbial nightcap?
Yeah. Yeah, wow.
I'm gonna have to pass on that very tempting offer.
Wow. rejected.
well, no, don't think of it that way.
uh, think of it...I-I-I'm gay.
you're gay?
I'm a big fat gay.
Why? Because I'm married?
well, because you're married and because you're Lew's girl
And...'cause I'm getting the strangest feeling about you.
Yeah, you are?
Yeah, I mean, I can't believe I'm gonna say this out loud,
but I feel that I don't want to make love to you just the once
although I'm sure you would enjoy the shit out of it.
I don't think you're gonna get this chance again.
no? no.
mean.
You're...mmm...
mean, mean, mean, mean. You're just mean.
still, I'm gonna have to say no.
so I'm just, like, what, a story for your book?
you're not gonna bait me into changing my mind, Janie Jones.
but wait. Answer me this, though.
what is so sexy about a man who's been vasectomized?
Oh, I don't know.
I guess it shows that you can commit, that you can give your whole heart to someone,
make sacrifices to please a woman.
so you think a woman made me do this,
some castrating female?
definitely did this for a woman.
you are not some stray dog, Hank Moody.
you belong to someone.
Hey, you know, he throws these, uh, huge parties
and these people come and they drink his booze,
and they act like they're his friends.
Yeah, I've heard.
guest of honor never shows.
I'm not sure I can bear to watch the rest of this.
it's pretty much over once baby comes out of the corner.
were you even alive in the fall of 1987?
of course I was alive.
it was a good time.
I was in the mail room at William Morris.
Marce was still at N.Y.U.
one day, somebody broke in to her dorm room.
some homeless crack addict snuck in and stole all her jewelry,
so I tried to think of a movie that might cheer her up.
it worked, didn't it?
we had to go all the way up to 57th street to see it
some crappy little theater that's not even there anymore.
the duane reade across the street
where I went in to buy her twizzlers and a diet coke
that's still there.
Charlie, she'll get better.
she'll be home soon
and everything will get back to normal.
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
she'll quit the bolivian marching powder.
I'll put my libido back in a box
then the whole cycle can start over again.
well, I don't know much about marriage,
but it doesn't sound so entirely bad to me.
you're probably right.
what's your choice, right?
I mean, you choose your partner, then you do the dance.
what's the alternative? Sit the whole thing out?
no way. You can't do that, right?
and at the very least, I mean.....you got to dance the last dance of the season.
I'm not sure that's a very good idea.
What?! I'm not talking anything carnal
just a simple box step.
I stay in my dance space, you stay in your dance space.
well... maybe that can work.
except I'm not very good.
Oh, well, me neither.
here you are. Thank you.
right where you started.
none the worse for wear, huh?
you're right. You're right.
Yeah. Thank you.
um, really, that was such a great night.
and I appreciate it.
well, it's not just the music, right?
it's how and...when you hear it.
that's it. Yeah.
okay. Don't forget your work stuff.
thank you.
I don't get to say that a lot.
uh, girls that work at jumbo's clown room Don't usually have briefcases and shit.
Yeah, I can imagine there wouldn't be a whole lot of use for that, right?
so, Lew, it's been real.
Yikes. We're gonna shake hands?
Yes, we are.
it's, uh, my date, my rules, right?
so it was a date?
well, anytime two people meet after 7: 00 p. m. It's a date, right?
my thoughts exactly.
what the fuck is wrong with people?
nobody has the balls to actually say that they're on a date.
I'm sorry. I can't seem to let go of your hand. I know.
you kind of, sort of remind me of someone I once knew.
okay, I do? well, I know.
you should take her to the Hollywood bowl.
cause that was such a great date. She would love that.
maybe I will. I mean, I used to all the time.
we'd sit in the cheap seats.
you know, if I ever had another chance...
right. If you ever had another chance, you'd do it different.
well, everybody says that, and it's bullshit
cause you do it just the same.
no, no, no, not me, I swear. I learn from my mistakes.
you do?
totally.
Oh, My god! You're insane!
Hey, I'm sorry. I lied.
life's just too fucking boring not to try, okay?
right. That is true. I will give you that.
lew, seriously, that was an amazing night.
a-and let's not ruin it.
I really appreciate it. I had a great time.
okay? Thank you.
I guess I'll take that if it's all I can get.
Oh, my god! You're not still trying!
sorry. Truce.
Yeah, truce. Good, good.
let's leave on a peaceful note.
Oh, my god.
what are you doing, woman?
look at you. You don't have your keys out.
you got all those bags.
you're like one of those victims in a self-defense instructional video.
what are you doing?
any deviant could jump out at you at this point
And...then a stranger could be waiting.
there is a strange guy waiting for me.
who? me?
Yeah! what?!
are you -- are you stalking me?
stalking you? Mm-hmm.
no, if I was stalking you, I wouldn't have to ask you where you've been tonight.
are you asking me that?
you don't have to tell me.
good. 'cause I won't.
well, d-don't you want to know where I've been?
because I have been somewhere tonight.
no, not especially.
no, I want to tell you.
let me just tell you what I did not do, okay?
I went on a date with this beautiful woman,
an amazing woman -- no, no, no!
and I did not have sex with her.
not? yeah.
I just cock-blocked myself. I remained chaste.
I-I kept my eye on the big picture.
I exercised some impulse control.
Uh-huh. Till the moment that you had to get in your car
and drive here and tell me about it?
well, yeah, that impulse I did not control.
now, I wanted to share that with you.
well, thank you. I'm -- I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go. um...
why are you looking at me like that?
how am I looking at you?
like you want a reward or something.
you have something?
I have a little biscuit.
you have a biscuit?
a little cookie for you.
Hank.
that was very rewarding.
I just had to check to see, you know,
if I could still break through that impulse control of yours.
apparently, you can.
thank god.
Hey, is Becca really at a friend's house tonight?
she's not with Damien?
no. come on.
are you fucking insane?
no, but you obviously are.
I don't want to talk about it.
well, okay, what do you want to talk about?
I -- you know...
I want to know about your date.
did you really just shut that poor woman down?
just shut her down, yeah. just -- I was the boss.
well, I did kiss her, but I didn't go inside.
gross.
well, I'm just saying. Gross.
but I refrained.
you refrained from tapping that ass?
I refrained from tapping that ass.
was that a first?
we still don't know why you were so late returning to home tonight.
big night at the book club, was it?
Yes.
did you o.d. on estrogen
and have to come home for a little...
I was actually on a date.
Oh, jesus.
that's gross.
and it was quite fun.
now you're disgusting. I don't want to hear that shit.
Yes, you do.
you're gonna hear about it unless you can, um, unless you can stop me.
can you stop me?
what is that?
that's a male member. I thought you'd met.
no, no, no, no. Hank, that.
what is that?
that's -- that's my groin.
it's like a lump or something.
well, did you always have that?
Hank?
I'm having what you might call a crisis of faith.
to put it simply, I can't write.
you have this incredible talent, and you're just flushing it down the toilet.
maybe you're right.
I'm fucked up right now.
I need you.
no, I'm getting married.
is dad a bad person?
no. Not at all.
I mean, he does have a habit of getting into trouble sometimes.
fuckin' fucker!
get on with your life.
and forget about the woman you didn't want to marry.
as your friend and agent, may I suggest you start looking for a nice girl.
what is your name, by the way?
wouldn't you rather just fuck me?
I'm a scientologist, Hank.
so, you're the famous writer, huh?
this is Mia, Bill's daughter.
she's 16.
what happened the other night will never happen again.
I know you guys aren't gonna live happily ever after.
it's just nice to be together sometimes.
I want to go back and do it all over again.
I'm gonna marry Bill.
I wrote something.
you what?
Hank wrote a new book?
can I read it?
I don't think that's appropriate.
what did you write?
an older man unwittingly beds an underage girl.
I wrote this novel.
this young woman's written the book of the year.
is that right?
if I say anything, there's no stopping her from telling Karen
fuck, the police.
if anyone knows of a reason why this couple should not wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.
what?
wait!
you sure?
quick, before I change my fuckin' mind.
Karen, wait!
come back!
are you ready?
fuck, no.
you are gonna be so glad you did this.
I don't want to talk about it right now.
I've got a godlike erection.
seems a shame to waste it.
we got to get going.
Really?
you'd deny a dying man his final meal?
Oh, my god.
you're gonna milk this for all it's worth, aren't you?
Absolutely.
don't make me beg.
it's unseemly.
fine.
you better make it snappy.
Oh, you won't feel a thing. I promise.
Oh, what are you doing?
just assuming the posish.
Oh, hot diggety.
what are you doing?
I'm assuming my posish.
get a rubber.
one more time.
come on, what's the big deal?
that's my point exactly. I'll pull out and hose you down.
Oh, is that supposed to turn me on?
uh, maybe.
did it?
not so much.
you better start talking dirty.
this could take a while.
what do you want me to say?
uh, right before you come.
call me Bill.
who says I'm gonna come?
Ooh, a challenge.
game on.
get ready for Thor's hammer.
you want to see it?
see what?
the section of the vas def I just cut out.
Oh, vas definitely not.
if it feels like I'm sewing the flesh at the base of your penis back together, that's because I am.
why do you look like a welder?
you're not welding anything, are you?
so, why the vasectomy?
I hate the rubbers.
Yeah, me too.
can't feel a damn thing.
try not to give the guy a hard-on, okay?
that would be messy.
looks like there's a new pope.
pain and swelling -- totally normal.
a bag of frozen peas should do the trick.
some prefer edamame. It's totally up to you.
no sex for 48 hours, and that includes masturbation.
after that, the more the better.
seriously.
you still got a lot of valuable sperm up in there.
got to get it out somehow.
if you need any help, let me know.
great-looking cock.
thank you.
don't think I don't see what's happening here.
Oh, what's that?
you're not attracted to me anymore.
that's right, that's right.
I ran away with you on my wedding night because you just don't do it for me anymore.
Yes. See, on a purely chemical level, you realize that I can't impregnate you anymore.
the biological imperative has been compromised.
you should consider yourself lucky that we're even having sex.
Oh, I do.
I do. And it's been rad.
you know, I forgot what a little hellcat you can be.
no, no, no, no.
please, don't do that.
Aw, no, that was gross.
seriously. - Man should not meow.
ever.
we're doing what couples do, Hank.
we're making responsible, grownup decisions.
together.
why are you smiling like that?
how am I smiling?
like a retard.
it was just nice to hear you refer to us as a couple again.
sounded good.
they really did neuter you, didn't they?
kiss the eunuch.
Oh, honey!
God. Don't grind.
no grinding. - I know, but I forgot. I'm so sorry.
how's the package?
this is not a conversation I ever wanted to have with my daughter, but thanks for asking, sweetie.
she called.
she who?
that real-estate whore.
she's bringing some people by.
language, young lady.
next time she tells me to clean my room, I'm gonna say,"clean this, lady!"
and give her a titty twister.
as much as I'd like to see that, the idea is to sell this place and get out of dodge.
if you tidied up your shrine to Norwegian death metal, it might facilitate things a little bit.
I don't want to help sell the place because I don't want to move.
this is our home.
we're happy here.
I love L.A.
she's your daughter.
Hey, honey, not that I mind having this conversation for the 73rd time this week, but could we do it maybe when daddy's balls don't ache so much?
and it's black metal, not Norwegian!
she needs more time.
no
Karen, we have discussed this like the responsible parents that we are.
Hank, New York will always be there for us.
you agreed that she'd be better off in New York.
but that doesn't mean we have the right to yank her away from the only life she knows.
goddamn it. I need a cigarette.
how about a vicodin?
Oh, I like-o-din.
well, that'll do.
my poor little gelding.
that's mean.
Oh, Karen.
peas!
or edamame!
that is nice.
make yourself at home.
mi casa es su casa.
might want to start out at the patio, though.
Hey, big fella, you think I might get my hands on some frozen veggies there?
I think you should wait your fuckin' turn.
you.
me.
we. - Sure did.
couple of times, actually.
long time ago.
in a galaxy not so far away.
so, what's going on?
Oh, not much.
I'm just, uh, you know, in the market for some frozen peas, maybe some edamame.
totally up to me.
are you okay? - Yeah. Why?
I'm -- I'm fine.
I don't know, you seem like you're in pain.
no more than usual.
how you doing?
same old.
livin' la vida loca.
true dat.
it's hard out there for a pimp.
so.
do you want to get high and listen to some records?
Oh, dear.
would that I could, but.
big life changes since last we made the love.
got back together with the ex.
baby mama.
it's on.
that's too bad.
you were a great lay.
that is.
so sweet of you to say.
I will tell the old lady you said so.
be well, Hank.
you -- you too.
surfer girl.
what are you, some kind of pussy?
she would have totally fucked you.
I don't do that anymore.
you should do that while you still can.
you never know when you're gonna wind up in one of these.
Aw, come on, you don't really need that thing.
I bet you just like to zip around in it. Makes you feel special.
Oh, yeah?
you ever hear of a prolapsed rectum?
asshole.
rectum?
damn near killed him.
Hello?
yeah?
no.
Oh, she was there when I left.
you, Becca.
in the car -- now.
dad. - I'm not fuckin' around! Now!
so, who is this, like, your dad?
go away.
I'm serious.
I'll kill you.
your dad's kind of a dick.
kind of?
I don't want her hanging out here.
what am I supposed to do, kick her to the curb?
she's my little pseudo-sister.
what is this?
it's not a memoir.
it's a written account of my sexual relationship with you.
written by me as a fuckin' novel.
even I'm confused, and I stole the damn thing.
well, I hope you're enjoying it.
I hope all my hard work is paying off for you.
is it?
it is, very much so.
just as I hope you're enjoying my father's wife.
he says hi, by the way.
he doesn'T.
are you all right.
here?
you're all alone, and I.
much as it warms the cockles to hear you say it, I'm fine.
don't worry about me.
worry about the Becca.
she's pissed off, and she's scared.
scared?
think about it.
she got what she always wanted -- the happy ending to beat all happy endings.
she's just waiting for the other shoe to drop -- for you to fuck it up, or for Karen to realize she made a big mistake.
both have been known to happen.
goddamn it, I need a cigarette.
goodbye.
I know you're pissed at me.
I know your mother and I have done some pretty unforgivable shit to you, and I know you're rapidly approaching that age where the very thought of having a conversation with your father makes you nauseous.
but I just want you to know that I'm not gonna quit trying.
okay?
cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
and I love the shit out of you.
how's the balls?
the boys have seen better days.
thank you.
was that a laugh?
my pain is funny to you?
Jesus, you're just like your mother.
you should know what that woman put me through.
it is a hideous, barbaric.
almost medieval procedure.
Hey, buddy, you're preaching to the choir, okay?
I've been there.
Really? You've been vasectomized?
why do you think we don't have any little rug rats?
I guess I just always assumed you were barren.
asshole.
Hey, be nice to my wounded soldier.
he started it.
or the bald eagle was shooting blanks.
that I am, my good man, ever since the snip, snip, snip.
well, the second one.
you're gonna freak him out.
what do you mean "the second one"?
the second what?
you know, t-they -- sometimes, uh.
it doesn't take.
doesn't take?
that's not cool.
that's not cool at all. - Sometimes you got to do it again.
I did not have a perfectly good chunk of my vas def cut off just so I could go back to wearing condoms just like some pimply-faced teenager.
I love the rubbers.
Why?
what do you mean?
why do you love rubbers? - They slow me down, man.
keep me in the game.
retard sensation.
he's an excitable boy.
that's right.
are you intimating that he ejaculates prema-charlie?
nice. - Thank you.
great, right?
uh, why -- why would you guys want to go back to that disgusting city of yours?
Oh, don't bring that up. It's because it's a city.
Oh, come on.
have a white wine.
Yeah.
awkward.
Hey, Karen!
Hey, look. - Hey, Sonja.
nice to see you again.
you mean to say that you found something better than a pseudo-religious cult founded by a lunatic sci-fi hack?
do tell.
well, it's a little complicated over drinks.
but maybe lunch tomorrow?
you know, it's been too long.
sure. - Wait. Whoa, whoa, hold on a second.
I'm not sure how I feel about two ladies with whom I've made the love lunching together.
okay, I'm pretty sure I feel pretty good about it.
you know, it's cute.
you guys are.
what -- you're officially back together?
for now.
until we fuck it up, right?
could be any second now.
dude, Julian's a writer, too.
Really? My condolences.
he wrote "the artist within."
fucking genius.
no way.
check, please.
Hank, that's rude.
I'll send you guys a copy if you want.
no need.
I have it on my nightstand right now.
I love it.
let me try to understand this.
hold on a second.
you write about what it's like to be an artist?
don't be a douche, Hank.
Oh, you ask the impossible, sweetheart.
no, it's fine.
the negativity is -- it's normal.
what I write about is, uh, accessing the artist that exists inside every single one of us.
Yeah, that really works.
I mean, I've never been happier.
my business has never been better.
in fact, I'm thinking of expanding, bringing on an architect.
we should talk.
so, you -- you really believe that everybody on this planet has, uh, an artist inside them, like, an inner Schnabel, if you will?
I do.
which means you must consider yourself an artist.
uh, I like to think of myself as more of A.
creative midwife.
Ah, well, I like to think of myself as having a 12-inch cock, but it doesn't make it so.
Oh, my god.
2 inches shy.
Ah, well, we have to get going, baby.
fashionably late is one thing.
Oh, right.
you know what?
we're going to this party up in laurel canyon.
you guys want to come?
you would fucking love this house.
a party?
even us? - Yeah.
Yes, even you.
fuckin' "a," let's go.
you in?
no, but have fun.
I quit smoking.
look at you.
no, I'm good, thanks.
what, did you give it up for lent?
Oh, no, I'm, uh.
I'm pregnant.
you didn't -- you didn't notice my bump?
Yeah, I did.
I just thought you put on weight.
no. - No, I'm kidding.
Congratulations.
Thanks. Thank you.
Yeah, we're very happy.
well done, lady.
last time I saw you, you were boning a degenerate doggy-style and projectile-vomiting all over Bill's bedroom
two things which I totally dug about you.
was -- was that me?
Yeah, don't ever change.
what the hell?
what? - Shooting cock pain.
I got to go.
good to see you.
my mama!
what the fuck?
I've only been gone for two seconds.
you're not supposed to do that.
why not, daddy?
you know why not.
I know, but.
just look how nice they look.
pretty little maids all in a row.
just - you want to go back to promises?
don't you remember.
how good the sex used to be when I used to sprinkle it on your naughty bits?
I seem to recall something vaguely pleasant about the sensation, yes.
what do you know -- you're without "the artist within."
must be lonely.
you must be jealous.
that's kind of cute.
come on.
we got to go.
I am so touched by what you did for me today.
I am.
Yes, but.
what I did for you today means that I can't do this or anything like it for the next 48 hours.
Oh, yeah.
well, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
geez, I like you stoned.
I like you liking me stoned.
holy shit.
what?
I think you're giving me a boner.
Oh, well, that's great news.
it is great news.
no, no, it is.
I just -- I'm afraid I might pop a stitch.
come here. - No, no.
I want to check it.
I-I'll be right back.
I don't want you to see him like this.
it could be bl.
what are you doing?
assuming the posish.
feel free to start without me.
Hey, you got a rubber?
uh, I think I got the ramses in my wallet from high school, but I'm pretty sure it's expired.
hand it over.
I was kidding.
fuckin' chick is insisting I, uh, wear a rubber.
what -- what is that all about?
that's not very rock-'n'-roll.
not at all.
if it's dark enough, you could rip open an alka-seltzer.
and bang her with it?
no.
just -- it'll create the illusion that you're wearing a jimmy hat.
david Copperfield does it.
not on stage.
Thanks, man.
you know, I was kidding.
Hey, asshole!
Hello?
Hey, anybody got an alka-seltzer?
this fucking perv just tried to mouth-rape me!
Really?
what the fuck, dude?
you're a guest in my home, and you go mouth-rape.
what's your name, sweetheart?
destiny.
Felicity.
come on, there was no raping.
I wasn't raping.
I'm not a rapey kind of guy.
I was looking for you.
there you are. God!
tell him I'm not rapey.
I accidentally went down on her.
what?
how do you accidentally go down on someone?
big house, a lot of rooms, it was dark.
I went to the bathroom, got turned around, and accidentally went down on her.
I buy it.
sell it to her.
Ah, so I seem to have procured a little prophylactic.
I'll get the car.
I know -- I smell like pussy.
I'm sorry, Karen.
I'm very sorry.
that was an honest mistake.
Oh, you just had your mouth on another woman's vagina?
Yes, I did, but the moment my tongue hit clit, I knew it wasn't yours.
it wasn't perfect.
I could pick your pussy out of a police lineup of pussy.
Hank. - I could.
you know, if your pussy was ever arrested, god forbid.
and it had to be identified in some kind of a lineup,
I would get it right away.
pussy number 2, step forward, turn profile.
that's Karen.
Oh, my god.
I must have been fucking crazy thinking things could be different.
fuck me!
don't start saying things you can't take back.
I don't want to take it back.
Yes, you do.
no, I don't.
you do.
don't tell me what I mean.
good evening, a'sir, mam.
good evening.
you know why I stopped you?
uh, no, I don't, sir.
educate me, officer.
Dick?
shut up. - Really?
Hank, shut up. - Officer Dick.
and that was mean, by the way.
that was really a low blow.
coming from the mouth rapist?
you have a headlight out.
Yes, it's been that way for months, but tonight I get stopped, of all nights.
just my fuckin' luck!
Oh,'cause it's all about luck.
it has nothing - can we just sleep on it?
can we sleep on this?
is there a reason you're not wearing a shirt, sir?
Yes, there is, officer.
there's a very good one, and I couldn't even begin to explain.
Oh, no.
try, try.
see if he thinks it was an honest mistake.
okay, one more time, for the cheap seats.
what happened back there could have happened to anybody!
wrong place, wrong time.
wrong vagina!
I-I'm sorry.
H-he's been drinking.
what the fuck, Karen?
have you been drinking, sir?
hours ago.
but not to excess.
I dot do that anymore.
I mean, I do, but not nearly as often as I used to.
and he's been taking vicodin.
Oh, come on, now.
that's -- Karen.
I know you're pissed at me for going to do on that woman, but are you trying to get me thrown in jail?
could you step out of the car, please?
whoa, whoa, hold on, sir - out of the car now.
you just caught us at a really, really bad time.
it's a bad time for us.
excuse me for saying so, ma'am.
you don't have to put up with this kind of behavior.
I know.
why don't you just mind your own fuckin' business!
excuse me, sir?
all due respect, officer, but aren't you stepping deutsi the job description a little bit?
I didn't know you guys had the right to editorialize.
have you been smoking marijuana, sir?
one hit.
one! - Turn around.
come on, you can't arrest somebody for being a wiseass.
no, but I certainly can for driving under the influence, can't I?
officer, excuse me.
this is just, like, a big misunderstanding.
of course it is. Okay?
you know, the thing that I can't understand is what a woman like that is doing with a prick like you.
she's got to have a screw loose, right?
maybe that's how you like 'em, right, a little crazy?
maybe if you go down on her a little more often.
what the.
No!
No!
not the balls!
I am right in the middle of a nasty divoe.
Oh, you can play hard to get all you like, runkle.
but sue collini always gets the weenie.
how's it going, professor?
in a word?
awesome.
look, hank, i know you're not exactly what anyone would call an education professional.
but my wife went out on a limb for you.
what do you think of jackie?
you're old enough to be her father.
you find me irresistible?
has a woman ever punched you in the face?
you know what?
you should use me.
Really?
this is where you work?
you wanna come inside?
would that involve seeing you naked?
Oh, most definitely.
I think not.
in the interest of student-teacher relations.
we're being all normal and responsible, and -
what if in the process, we just kind of get over each other?
what if you tell me about our daughter?
who are you texting? -chelsea.
tell her you're being a total dick right now.
I fucking hate you!
and i fucking hate you too, you little shit!
no, no, no, no. you don't have to do that.
not on my account.
Oh, well you see that is a prime example of what's wrong with the younger generation today.
you leave nothing to the imagination.
so you've got yourself some boobs.
some nice, big, round boobs.
everybody's got 'em.
you know, nothing to get excited about.
you know, just...
Yes, fraulein.
do you have anything you'd care to add?
on the subject of?
on the subject of the subject we were just discussing.
Oh, that subject.
let me think.
not a thing. nope.
wait, no, there is something i would like to say.
excellent. we're all ears.
do you think the ladies have gone too far with the sex-positive feminism?
I mean, i know they all say they're down with the pornography and the shaved pudenda and whatnot, but do we really think that this is the path to liberation?
what do you think?
I'm not sure this is the proper forum for such a discussion, hank.
well, you asked me. i'm just thinking out loud.
spitball. -okay, everyone.
that'll do it for today. thanks for coming. -already?
Yeah, see you all tonight. -my lord.
you too, hank. correct?
I'm sorry?
tonight.
my house.
english department fall mixer.
ring any bells?
not a one.
Oh, it's just a little get together we have at the start of every school year.
faculty, grad students, some wine, some cheese.
well, that sounds awesome and i'm stoked, but alas, i've got plans with the soul-sucking vampire i call my daughter tonight, so i gotta take a rain check-- well no, chelsea's already asked if becca can spend the night.
Yes, but i think she'll change her plans when she hears what her old man's got on tap.
besides, wine gives me a headache and cheese makes me fart, a lot.
you don't want me stinking up the place.
now what if i said your job depends on it, hank?
are you sexually harassing me right now?
because if you are, i think i'm gonna have to report you.
for giving me a serious boner.
good to know.
see you at 7: 00.
no means no, you know.
this man is ruining my life.
by making it unbearably awesome.
sweetie, i'm not really sure i understand what the problem is.
he's delusional.
he thinks we're going to hang out and bond or something.
okay, hand it over.
thank you.
you don't understand, woman. i have a plan.
you do?
Yes, if we never leave the house, nothing bad can ever happen.
right,'cause, like, your parents never fuck you up.
no, you see, you were supposed to find that last remark charming.
hold-- hello?
this thing on?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, uh, i'm here, i just, um, my boss is trying to get through.
I'm--I'm late for a dinner with him and some clients, so.
well, don't go.
just blow it off.
please, will you take care of the becca thing, please?
Yes.
I will take care of it. -bye. bye.
Yes, father?
don your best frock.
the wine and cheese awaits.
you see that bathroom over yonder?
once, i took every crooked inch jackie gleason had to offer in that stall.
signed kristofferson right here in this booth.
Yeah, time there was when i would get wet off a great sign.
Oh, that's right.
I'm talking dripping, fucking ganges wet.
speaking of the good old days--sue collini?
over there, sir. -hey, springfield.
get your toned tush over here.
sorry i'm late.
some tarzana housewife paid a grand to spend the day with me.
she wanted to make out, so i did her a solid and i ate that butterscotch for, like, 45 minutes straight.
right, rick.
this is my subordinate and prospective boytoy, charles w. runkle.-pleasure.
sue and i used to see each other, you know.
early '80s.
Rick, in what universe is fucking like chinchillas and blowing coke up each other's asses "seeing each other"?
I'm a big fan of your oeuvre, rick.
all of it.
the music, the acting-- hey, i'm flattered.
you know, like i said on the phone, i mean, i'm not looking for representation.
Oh, bullshit.
housewives in tarzana?
Rick, don't tell me that you don't wanna rawdog the top shelf like you used to in your prime, huh?
all due respect, sue, life just isn't about the pussy.
it's about finding your passion and never letting go, and this man has done just that.
quit licking his shaft.
he's always been a prime cut of usda beefcake, and he knows it.
sure, the ladies love him.
september 7, 2002, the best sex i ever had with my wife.
Rick springfield at the universal amphitheater, was like three solid hours of foreplay, dude.
everything she wanted to do with him in 1982 but didn't know how, she did with me repeatedly and i thank you, sir.
fat lot of good that does me.
okay, runkle, get to the point.
first, we get you some indie cred.
let's find you your wrestler, like mickey rourke.
let's see you blow people away with your serious side, huh?
get an oscar nom for playing an addict, a cripple, a retard, whatever.
then you go into every office in town and you hit 'em with your passion project.
that's how you get it done.
and harry greenberg agency actually has the mojo to make something like that happen?
fuck no.
you supply the mojo.
we take care of everything else.
I like the sound of that.
church.
you're scaring me, sue.
does that mean you like that?
finally.
God, what took you so long?
what up, hank?
Becca, this is your last chance to change your mind, come on.
just do me one favor.
anything, my churlish love.
try not to get too hammered.
don't put daddy in a corner.
Oh, hank.
you don't wanna park there.
Dean hates it when you block the entrance.
big date tonight?
is it that obvious?
that dress could cure cancer!
I think you should fuck him.
you know, if he agreed to meet you at this sad assembly of two-bit intellectuals, he clearly digs the shit out of you.
you have the ability to make a simple cocktail party into the worst thing that's ever happened to you.
it's a gift, really.
there you are.
did you two come together?
no.
we just came in together. -oh, i see.
and i actually get more bars outside, excuse me.
did you happen to see where becca and chelsea got off to?
they're fine. they went straight to chelsea's room.
come in, come in. i have so many people i want you to meet.
come on, baby.
celebrate with me.
don't baby me, jackass.
no.
fuck no.
I got a date.
well, drop the zero and get with the hero.
I signed a big fish today.
Oh, well good for you.
maybe you can move the fuck out now.
right. well.
force of habit, i guess.
every time i sign a client, i just can't help but picture the two of us with a bottle of bubbly.
well, that was then, charlie.
and this is now.
got it.
okay, well...
have a nice date.
Yeah, thanks.
runkle, you were on fire today.
I mean, that was serious swifty lazar shit.
I've never been so proud and so wet...
at the same time.
come on.
thank you.
how many jobs do you have, lady?
you got a paper route too?
fill this thing up.
scotch preferably.
I'm coming off of a lengthy conversation with a man in a sweater vest.
Dean koons keeps the good stuff locked in his office.
which would be where, exactly?
I can't tell you that.
people like you mess with the master's shit.
people like me get blamed for it.
class warrior, are we?
just a girl saving for a rainy day.
you know, the truth is i'm a pretty shitty bartender.
but i am a kick ass stripper.
this body is the true gift that god gave me.
I agree, but i think you're selling yourself short still.
what, i'm too smart to be a stripper?
smart has nothing to do with it.
I'm just thinking in practical terms. down the road, job opportunities tend to dwindle for those in the more naked professions, if you understand what i'm saying.
two empty glasses, jackie, thank you.
I'm going to offer our, uh, visiting scholar from amherst some of my '82 la tour.
that's not cool, dean koons.
segregating your guests into two classes, offering your good stuff only to a select few.
well, when you get your guggenheim, we can talk about that.
in the meantime, you enjoy that glass of very middling cab.
asshole.
there you are.
I see you found the toys in the attic.
what, are you running a museum here on the side or something?
Oh, it's just his little hobby.
bores the shit out of me, actually.
I'm quite relieved to catch you here alone.
you don't care about the snooping?
snoop all you want.
my life's an open book.
sadly.
besides, becca must have told you all about us by now.
no, she's not much one for chatting.
texting, yes.
twittering, tweetering, twatting, staring solemnly at the old man.
Oh, please.
you fathers have it easy.
most days, i can barely get a civil word out of chelsea.
at least becca still talks about you with some sort of twisted affection.
my becca? that doesn't sound like her.
no, it's true.
we had an interesting discussion the other day about the more scatological elements in your work.
and she knows quite a lot about rabelais.
Yes, that's me. i taught her that shit.
Yeah, i figured, when she told me all about how you got your start in new york and how you met her mother.
no shit.
Yeah, i mean, she seems a little confused about the issue of whether you two are still together or not.
aren't we all.
Oh, well, that's a shame.
gosh, i'd love to fix you up sometime.
uh, i appreciate that, but that's a fool's errand.
Oh, really? why is that?
well, it's my purgatory, really.
dinner, drinks, whatever.
never really all that interested, but i find myself telling her how beautiful she is anyway.
cause it's true.
all women are, in one way or another.
you know, there's always something about every damn one of you.
there's a smile, a curve, a secret.
you ladies really are the most amazing creatures.
my life's work.
but then there's the morning after.
the hangover, and the realization that i'm not quite as available as i thought i was the night before.
and then she's gone.
and i'm haunted by yet another road not taken.
I'm impressed.
you actually dropped the act for a moment and said something real.
Yes, i do that sometimes.
but you never know when it's coming.
you gotta stay on your toes.
I'm like a boxer that bobs and waves like mohammed ali or joe frazier or sugar ray leonard.
basically, i'm just listing boxers you might have i'm sorry.
the party's downstairs, isn't it?
I think you might be selling yourself a little short.
with just the tiniest bit of effort, you could've had someone much younger and much hotter.
but better luck next time, teach.
what's the matter with you? you look flushed.
well, my virtue was just assailed.
in a not entirely unpleasant manner, but still.
leaving so soon?
Yeah. girl can only take so much humiliation in one night.
Oh, the gentleman caller never called, huh?
no, he never called.
and he never texted.
and he made an actual plan to meet me here.
and, you know, he seemed really into it on the first two dates.
and then, he just never showed.
what--go ahead and explain that to me, would you?
take a shot, you said you would explain it and, and why?
it's, like, so hard to make a phone call?
you seem to forget that i'm not the man who stood you up.
Ah, here's where he keeps the good stuff.
me!
we were talking about me here.
okay.
I'm gonna say this once and one time only, so listen closely, okay?
fuck the fireman.
if i recall, that was the same advice you gave me earlier in the evening.
totally different context.
so that's it.
just fuck him.
that's all you got. i--i gotta be totally laid back about this.
I'm not even allowed to be pissed off.
no, you get to be, you get to be pissed off.
but, uh, you know, maybe if you just relaxed for--whoa-- half a second, and stopped looking so hard for the appropriate life mate, then you might wake up one morning next to one.
right.
cause it's just that easy.
I didn't say it was easy, but you've got a serious gam up in the matter.
Oh, yeah. how, how so?
cause you're scary smart and you're crazy beautiful.
you're also incredibly sexual.
so there.
what the fuck are you talking about?
I'm a total nerd.
true that, but you're a sexy nerd.
you know, some women, they just shut off that part of themselves and they expect prince charming to come along and pry open their dusty old beavers with the jaws of life, or some shit like that.
not you. you're a good timer.
Yep.
and you're just saying this, right?
Which-- what, what do you mean?
well, you're saying all this incredibly weird but incredibly sweet stuff about me and but that's what you do, right?
that's what you do in the situation when you're trying to make me feel better.
Yeah. which is bad, why?
it's not necessarily a bad thing.
I just wonder if you mean anything that's coming out of your mouth.
I don't just say shit.
I mean, i do talk a lot of shit, but i generally mean what i say and i say what i mean.
so you see me as a viable candidate?
depends on what you're running for.
Dick, you know what i mean.
look, if--if my love life weren't as complicated as something that is...
really complicated that i can't think of right now, i would totally check your teeth and take you out for a ride.
God, i hate you!
what, you're a strange bird.
why are you hating on me?
cause i really thought you were gonna kiss me just then.
that is weird.
that is very weird.
Why?
cause i was thinking the exact same thing.
Really?
well, not exactly.
I was thinking about what it might be like to go down on you for the first time.
it's kind of the same thing, isn't it?
you're such an asshole.
do you feel it yet?
Nope.
is that normal?
totally.
mushrooms take a while to hit.
what's the craziest thing you've ever done?
sexually.
let's put it this way.
my father would be thrilled by my lack of experience in the area.
what about blow jobs?
I touched one.
kind of freaked me out how hard it got.
you?
a bunch of times.
it's fun.
weren't you scared?
sure.
at first. but then you realize how much power you have over guys, and it's kind of exciting.
I'm sure i'd do something wrong.
it's not like you're gonna break it.
I mean, as long as you're careful with your teeth and you remember to incorporate the balls, you can't fuck it up too bad.
ask any guy, he'll tell you.
okay.
good to know.
don't worry.
we'll get you laid this year.
no rush.
sometimes i think i'd be happy to stay a virgin forever.
seems like once you get laid-- your whole life basically turns to shit.
I've heard that one before.
come on, becky. you're slipping.
I've done a lot of work to get you out of that gloomy fuckin' head of yours.
think about it.
if my mother and father hadn't been so quick to fuck each other, i wouldn't be here right now.
and if i wasn't here right now, i think they'd be a lot happier.
especially my father.
that's really shitty that he makes you feel that way, becca.
he doesn't.
it's me.
I just see things.
is this it?
Yep.
I know, right?
no, not that.
no? -no.
I'm such a slut.
in the best way possible.
you're not, like, gonna lose respect for me now, are you?
8% at the most.
hold on.
thought i heard somebody. -shit.
no -shit.
go, go.
okay, you caught me.
Jesus! -watch that stuff.
here, let me take that off your hands.
moody, for christ's sake.
don't handle me.
please don't handle me.
what are you doing in my private office?
came in here to make a phone call.
that was-- that was your cell phone? -yeah.
I like me a '70s groove.
what about that ditty you were singing when you came in here?
may i inquire about that?
that was an obscure classic.
was it? yeah, yeah. is it, uh, some ditty of your own invention, perhaps?
no, it's right out of the great american songbook, for your information.
if you had a little more culture, you'd understand that.
maybe something you would have sung a capella with the whiff n' poofs?
gay man's health choir, or something like that?
Hey, you two.
party's in there.
you're not having any of my lowland malt.
I wouldn't dream of it but i would like some privacy to make a phone call.
no.
no? -no.
what do you mean, no?
that's not very polite.
well, my house, my rules.
what's gotten into him?
is there another way in here?
why do you want more privacy?
well, i just-- listen, hank.
about earlier, can we just forget what happened?
Oh, well, we needn't ever speak of it again.
but one does not very easily forget the kiss of a beautiful woman.
that's right.
I said it. i meant it.
I'm here to represent it.
I gotta run 'cause that cheese is working on me.
I was looking for charlie.
he's gone home for the day.
you must be sue.
Yes.
Marcy, the ex.
he's told me all about you.
okay, well, if you just tell him that i was looking for him, i was gonna give him this bottle of-- smoker's cough.
love those more menthols.
Yes.
are you inside that woman?
I can explain.
Jesus christ. -marcy.
Marcy, it-- it was nice to meet you, sue.
Marcy, marcy, don't go.
Oh, god, okay.
let's just keep my ass closer to the ground, please.
there you go. -okay.
remind me to never take your advice again.
you're gonna thank me when you're living in the suburbs with that house with the attached garage of your dreams.
would you like a smoke?
no, i've broken quite enough rules for one night, thank you.
speaking of which, uh, probably wasn't cool of me to take advantage of you in your moment of weakness.
no, it wasn't.
but in fairness, uh, all of my moments are moments of weakness now.
so what's the matter with me anyway?
well, now that i've had an up close and personal view, i would have to say nothing.
Oh, come on, that old chestnut?
it's not me, i just haven't found the right guy?
Oh, my god. -what?
shit, he's here. -him who?
the fire dude.
wow, the balls on that guy, three hours late.
then again, you just had another dude inside you ten minutes ago.
Hey, ross.
you made it.
Yeah, you must really hate me right now.
she does.
um, yeah. that's not a lie.
I, um-- this is-- uh, this is dr. henry moody.
I'm her thesis advisor.
it's nice to meet you.
I was beginning to think that jill made you up, that you were a figment of her imagination.
well, i'm hoping you'll give me a chance to explain, you know, unless i'm too late.
maybe i've-- maybe i missed my chance.
well, normally she's a real stickler for verities and balderdash, but if you were out saving lives, i think an exception can be made for a real life fire dude.
don't you think?
what were you just saying, you want another fucking drink?
Yes. -just now.
you were, right?
I was. i--i need another fucking drink.
and spring for the good stuff.
get the top shelf.
don't be cheap.
see you in class, professor.
there's my dad.
what have you two been up to?
late night swim, midnight tennis match?
we, um, just walked down to campus to get some pizza.
pizza?
Yes, pizza.
come closer.
Why?
I want to smell you.
you smell like pizza.
be careful, don't get too close.
I feel a burp coming on.
you wouldn't.
I would.
and remember, sometimes burps smell worse than farts.
is that a threat?
you guys are so gross.
what, there's no bodily functions at the deanery?
just catered affairs?
Hey, dad, don't pick me up till noon tomorrow, okay?
okay, sweetie.
very cheerful.
very cheerful.
one night, felix.
that's it. all right?
understood.
I just, i can't go back there tonight.
I can't face her.
not after this humiliation.
remind me again how this humiliation is different from all the others.
I'm gonna need some eggs benedict tomorrow, blue man.
that i can do.
what i cannot do is resist the allure of a powerful woman.
so we're 100% sure she's 100% woman, right?
the balls of steel thing is just metaphorical?
you know what did the trick, hank?
what set me over the edge after weeks of resisting, one tiny little compliment about my agenting.
that's it.
that's all it takes to make a man come across.
they are not complicated creatures.
don't be so hard on yourself.
you were sexually harassed tonight.
as was i.
no man can withstand that kind of pressure.
Yeah, but do you know where i'd be if i'd been just a tiny bit stronger?
back in the promised land.
the whole package, man.
my own house, my own bed, my own wife.
next year, my hebrew friend.
next year in jerusalem.
the D. A.'s office is willing to drop the assault charges.
that's the good news. - What's the bad news?
you're being charged with statutory rape.
Yeah, you should probably consider a little "manscaping.
you're way hairy. - Really?
I'm late. - Bingo.
come on, let's go get you a pregnancy test.
fuck, the rabbit done died.
I met the wife.
Yeah, soon-to-be ex. Splitsville.
so you wouldn't mind if I took a crack at her?
considering that you actually wrote the book that I love, how about you rewrite the script that I loathe?
and Sasha Bingham will star?
Yes, she's reading as we speak.
what about Eddie Nero? - So is there a script?
fuck, no.
but he's getting close. - Ish.
with Sasha's interest and with Hank's face all over the news right now, we could be at Sundance this time next year.
the prosecution has a lame case, and they know it too.
have you met my attorney?
you should probably stay far away from the Mias and the Sashas of the world right now.
Hey, check it out.
you plead guilty to unlawful sexual conduct.
the statutory rape charge goes away.
discretion, counselor...
it being the better part of valor and whatnot.
in any case...
you're looking at a $1, 000 fine, 18 months summary probation.
uh, the only thing left to hammer out is the nature and duration of your community service.
done. Where do I sign?
but instead of doing community service, can I do a P. S.A?
Hi, I'm Hank Moody. Don't fuck teenagers.
and can I borrow a thousand bucks?
kidding... About the P. S.A.
I'll be damned.
I think I'm actually seeing some of that Hank Moody mojo up close and personal.
is my dong out?
you should probably card her just to be safe.
you are on fire.
Hi, excuse me. Do we know each other?
sorry, you're, uh, kind of famous.
that's right. I am kind of famous.
it's good to see that the young kids are still reading.
last time I checked, my shit wasn't Kindle-worthy.
sorry.
Dick.
don't open it. No, no.
let me... God. - Fuck you.
she's right. You are a dick.
nice work, asshole. Deal's off.
what? No fair. Indian giver.
as you know, the D. A. is running for governor.
and voters just don't take kindly to public officials who go soft on child molesters.
but nothing happened. The young ladies in question were just screwing around, and I put a stop to that shit.
I can't help it if some cock-tard in a fedora takes a picture at the exact wrong moment.
it doesn't matter. It looks like something happened.
it looks like you're out there thumbing your nose at the state of California.
okay, I get it. Duly noted... must stop thumbing nose.
all right?
so what do we do now? What's... what's the move?
you look for a new attorney. - What?
I should've gone with my gut on this one.
what are you saying, you're quitting?
in a word, abso-fucking-lutely.
I'm dropping the case, leaving the opportunity for you to find an attorney who suits your particular personality.
you can't do that. Can you?
Hank, I have never had a client who makes it this difficult for me to do my job.
you should talk to my agent.
I will. I'll call him, and I'll recommend someone new.
quitter.
good luck to you, Hank.
I wish I could say it was nice knowing you, but that would be a big, fat lie, because you have been an enormous pain in my ass.
normally I would have an incredibly childish retort to that, but I'm not going to. I'm gonna take the high road.
you have a great ass.
and the thought that I have brought it any pain brings me pain.
all I want to do is bring your ass pleasure.
that's how highly I regard it.
and there it goes, Abby's fantastic ass.
fare thee well. Take care.
we'll always have Century City.
I'm fucked.
go the fuck away.
I don't want any more fucking chocolates. It's you.
what do you want? - Settle down, grumpy.
can I come in?
haven't you caused me enough trouble?
this is my fault?
well, seeing as I'm in no mood to blame myself, yes, yes, it is.
come on in.
you live like a fucking animal.
which is exactly why it would never work out between us.
well, that and the fact that you're old enough to be my grandfather.
Oh, fuck, are you trying to make me kill myself?
so I have some good news and some bad news.
which would you prefer?
do it whatever way you want, fucking diva.
I'm dropping out.
of high school?
the movie.
Oh, that.
all right, I will... I will write you that big Oscar speech that you wanted at the end.
no, no, it's not that. - Okay, you got it.
this is a lot of bad press for me.
and while a scandal can be a good thing, this whole thing is getting a little unsavory.
okay, so no movie.
movie, no.
what's the good news?
the good news is that I still want to have sex with you, at least once more, if not twice.
that's the good news?
Oh, my.
you know, that is pretty good news.
maybe a little something for the pain.
shit. Put your shirt back on.
could be the law.
just as I suspected, the law.
Karen, come on in. - Hey.
Karen, I'd like you to meet Sasha Bingham.
they tell me she's a big movie star.
personally, I don't see it.
Hi, you're so beautiful.
Oh, my God, I totally get it now.
how'd you fuck this up? - Thank you.
that's helpful. You can go now.
it's nice to meet you, Sasha.
um, of course, I know exactly who you are, because I've seen all the photos.
and that's my cue.
peace.
I am disappointed in you, Karen...
reading all those stupid blogs.
Becca showed me.
bec... Oh, fuck.
how is she? Is she okay?
okay?
W-what does that even mean at this point?
Wha... Uh, what do you want from me, Karen?
look around. Welcome to rock bottom.
I'm living in this shitty, filthy hotel room.
my... my career's in the shitter.
you obviously hate me. Becca hates me.
my attorney dumped me.
your attorney dumped you?
how does that even happen?
I don't know. She got tired of my shit.
it's a trend. What the fuck? Whatever.
but wasn't she one of the good ones?
I think so. She seemed good.
she's smart, snappy dresser, nice briefcase.
what the fuck do I know about lawyers?
did you think to apologize?
I mean, you can really switch the charm on when you want to.
I don't have a switch. The switch is gone.
I can't find the switch.
can you just...
apologize to Becca for me and... and... and tell her that I'll... I'll make it up to her?
you know how you can make it up to her?
you can get your head out of your fucking ass and get your shit together.
Hank, you're slipping.
you're know, you're really fucking slipping.
I mean, whatever happens between us, you have always managed to be a decent father.
if you let that go, you're fucked.
you're totally fucked forever.
no, no, no, no, no. This is your shit.
I'm... I'm gone.
you figure it out.
Hola. - Hola.
okay.
please, you wait.
you got it.
Oh, hey, listen.
um, your boss...
pardon?
it's just that, uh, I have to get back to the West Side, and I want to kind of wrap it up before rush hour.
I no understand, but you no worry. I put perfect.
Irma, thank you very much.
I will take over from here, and you always put perfect.
Marcy, we meet again at last.
you made the appointment with me?
no, no, Irma booked the appointment on my behalf.
no, no. God, no.
I would rather explode.
no, when Irma called hot lips, they said that's what it would take for you to make a house call.
you got to be fucking kidding me.
listen, I called. I texted.
and in return, zilch.
so I had to get a little creative.
unbelievable.
baby, I'm a producer, so I produce.
what can I say?
well, you could say sorry, asshole, because I canceled a whole afternoon's worth of appointments.
do you know how much this little stunt of yours is gonna cost me?
wait, wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...
it's just that I wanted to see you...
so much.
I'll be glad to pay you for your time.
I-I mean, if you would just stay here and hang out for a while.
take it or leave it.
all right, then.
Sasha dropped out.
I know.
Abby too.
I know.
I've brought shame upon my family.
Oh, I know.
Yeah, that's it. It's decided, then.
I'm going out tonight.
like zig, I'm jerking myself to Jesus.
good knowing you, Runks.
sounds like a plan.
but you might want to reconsider.
Yeah, I don't think so.
guess who's back in the picture.
someone who can get this thing green-lit with one magic word.
come on, come on.
barack Obama.
Oh, what the fuck does that psycho want?
he says the script is keeping him up nights.
Yeah, he says he can't get the character out of his head.
he wants to hang out with you.
he says he wants to try the role on for size before he commits, you know?
experience a night in the life of the infamous Hank Moody.
I don't think he'd enjoy watching me go all autoerotic on myself. Do you?
maybe. Maybe not.
maybe you save that for another night.
maybe, yeah.
it'd be kind of rude to do to housekeeping, don't you think?
totally rude.
you'd have to leave a pretty big tip to make up for something like that.
totally.
you're coming with, right?
Yeah, I don't think Eddie likes me very much.
Oh, I don't think he does either, but you're coming with, right?
Yeah! Sounds like a party.
that chemically imbalanced freak better stay the fuck away from my balls.
wait, how did you go from waiter to producer?
robert Evans was a regular, and he always sat in my section. And one day he asked me to be his assistant on Urban Cowboy and...
get out.
you worked on that movie? Oh, my God!
that is one of my top ten guilty pleasure flicks of all time.
I fucking love that shit, Stu.
Really? Yeah, you don't say.
okay, look.
Oh, mercy, Marcy.
okay, one more. Tighten up.
there you go.
wow, Urban Cowboy.
God, I haven't seen that in, what, decades?
I got to Netflix that shit.
Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Hey, you're in luck.
see, I happen to have a digitally restored 35-millimeter print right here.
I mean... I mean, we could...
we could go watch it in my screening room right now.
Oh, God, I would love to, but I got to get back.
maybe some other time.
no, no, there's gonna be no other time.
I'm gonna be donating my entire film collection to U. S.C...
every picture I ever worked on... like, next week.
why are you doing that?
well, it's not like I have a family I can pass it down to.
and I don't know... I guess maybe it's my attempt to leave some kind of legacy.
you never got married, Stu?
Oh, no, I did...
three times.
you know, work...
work is a cruel mistress.
and I mean, she took, and she took, and she gave nothing back.
you call this nothing?
well, without a wife and family to share this with, what's any of this for?
let's get this over with.
where is that fucking Billy Goat?
I fucking missed you, Moody.
you too, Goldilocks.
Hey, let's do some drinking.
let's talk some story.
does she have to be 16?
what are you talking about?
I don't know, is there any value in her being 18
or 19, even?
but that's not illegal.
Yeah, but I'm trying to make the character a little more likeable, 'cause on the page, he's an asshole.
you understand that you are kind of talking about me right now?
okay, could she be younger, like 10 or 11?
that's disgusting.
pedophiles aren't very likeable either, Eddie.
it's a fine line, isn't it?
look, I'm not a prude, okay? Not... not by any stretch.
I think you know that about me.
I'm just trying to build the most three-dimensional character I can.
I need to see you fuck.
what? What?
I need to watch you make love to a woman.
no.
what you say, how you touch her, how you move your hips, how you thrust.
I need to know these things.
agent, get us some whores.
I think I see a couple over by the bar.
I'll be right back. - No, no, no, you stay right there.
that's it. I'm out. I quit this time.
it's over.
wait a minute, wait.
just sit down for a minute here,"Broseph.
are you an artist or a pretender?
neither. I'm a writer.
I think, I type, I drink.
lather, rinse, repeat, not always in that order.
as far as I'm concerned, art's just another guy from Brooklyn.
I used to be a pretender.
now I'm an artist.
wow, do you get a certificate with that or something?
Yeah, it's called the Motherfucking Academy Award, and I won mine for a Michael Mann movie called John.
great fucking movie.
I have sutures in my scrotum.
I played John, the gay hit man...
H. I.V. Plus.
you know how I prepared for that?
no.
I took a man in my mouth.
that's right.
I played his skin flute like Kenny G, like Kenny G on ecstasy.
I engineered his orgasm...
my hands, my mouth, my tongue.
and then he gave me his gift.
gave it to me on the inside.
and that's the day I graduated.
that's the day I stopped pretending and started being, because until you've savored both sexes, until you know how to make both of them come like baby gorillas, you do not know shit from Shinola.
I agree.
I know you do, friend.
I can smell it on you...
the ambivalence.
I think we should kill someone tonight.
I mean, like a hobo or something.
thank God.
yes?
Oh, hey, sweetie.
anything to get me out of where I am right now.
you sit tight. I'll be right over.
that's my kid. I got to jet.
nice talking to you, cocksucker.
Hey, hey, I completely understand.
that's what being a parent's all about.
listen, when my nanny calls with a problem, my assistant takes that call no matter what.
look, I'll go with you.
come on!
no. - Let's go! Dark and deep!
6 So I'm thinking Japanese.
Hey, she's 100 bucks short.
I didn't want to call the cops.
appreciate it. Let me see.
I'm not paying for that, sweetie.
I thought you said he'd be cool with this.
I thought he would.
I need the money, dad. - Yeah? Get a job.
okay, guess I'm calling the fucking cops.
nobody's calling the fucking cops!
what the fuck are you doing?
Oh, yeah, I knew it was gonna get dark tonight.
Yeah, sometimes you can just feel it.
here's what we're gonna do.
we're gonna back up slowly and get the fuck out.
I got your back, rapist.
you can't afford any more trouble with the police.
Hey, isn't that Eddie Nero?
holy shit, that's Eddie Nero.
holy shit, you're right.
you guys fans? - It is Eddie Nero.
God damn it!
Hank, the movie!
agent, pay him.
you fucked up my face. You fucked up the moneymaker.
okay, okay.
here we go. Should be a hundred there.
now, listen, while we're here, I'd like to get your professional opinion.
could you do something cool with this?
no, whoa! - What? What?
get this fucking guy out of my shop.
what? What? Okay, I'm going, I'm going.
I'm Karen. - Abby. Nice to meet you.
please, have a seat.
thank you so much for, um... for seeing me.
Oh, my pleasure.
uh, to be perfectly clear, I am no longer representing Mr. Moody.
I know. That's why I'm here.
I want to try to convince you to give him a second chance.
Why?
because I've given him too many already, and it's someone else's turn.
he is an absolute mess, Karen.
I know. Believe me, I have 16 years' experience in the field.
to be honest, I-I-I've never seen anything like it.
I-I don't think I can help him.
I don't think he even wants to be helped.
I think he wants to be punished.
you're right. You're absolutely right.
you're smart.
that's why he needs you.
I don't mean to be rude, but I-I have to ask.
how in the hell did you put up with this for as long as you did?
that's a good question. That's a very good question.
I don't even know if I have an answer.
I think the world sees Hank as this fabulous fuck-up.
and, um, I know that guy.
I've spent a lot of time with that guy.
but I am better acquainted with the other guy...
the one that listens and hears everything, the one that looks at you and sees right into your soul, the one that makes you believe in every fucking fairy tale that you've ever been told.
ultimately, I may not even be the woman who gets to enjoy the man that I know he can be, but I still want the best for him, because I want the best for my daughter.
I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to lay all this on you.
I-it's okay. I appreciate your candor, I do.
nice to meet you.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
so I'm the guy you call when you think your mother's gonna have a shit fit?
otherwise you don't want to have anything to do with me?
I just thought you'd understand.
you have tattoos.
mom has tattoos. - That's not the point.
what is the point, then?
these are my friends. They wanted me to do it.
Yeah, and if your friends wanted you to do drugs, would you do that?
of course I would. Wouldn't you?
a little bit of hypocrisy is fine, dad, but I'm the normal one here.
I'm supposed to be out getting fucked up with my friends.
you're supposed to be home watching TV with mom.
instead you're out there fucking teenagers and prancing around like a poor man's Bukowski.
I'm sorry I called you.
take it easy on your old man, okay?
he's as cool as they come.
Really?
Yeah, that's why I'm gonna play him in a movie.
Really?
you already said that.
you know who should play you?
I should give her a call.
I should fucking hit you. - Yeah, take a shot.
I'll hit you right back, you fucking nutter.
I said I should. I didn't say I was gonna.
but I am gonna do your movie.
Why?
because now I know what it's about.
and it sure the fuck isn't about warm, wet pussy.
it's about a guy trying to keep it together while falling apart.
it's about life, love, sex, and the ever-lurking presence of the grim fucking reaper.
it's about men...
husbands, wives...
daughters, and fathers.
it's about the motherfucking dark side.
you and the motherfucking dark side.
come here.
come on.
come here, pussy fart.
get in on this.
some got to win, and some got to lose there, yep.
if the bull don't kill him, the clowns will.
what's all this, then, Stu?
Seriously? - This is it.
that's your move, the old "fake yawn, surreptitious grope" combo?
it's a classic. - It's a clam, Stu.
the next thing I know, you're gonna be sticking your dick up through the bottom of that tub of popcorn, diner style.
would that have worked?
wouldn't you like to know, Stu?
actually, I would.
I have to be honest with you, Marcy.
I suck with women.
ask my first three wives.
but I like you, and, um, thanks for hanging out.
and it's been a wonderful day.
Aw, sweet.
Oh, okay.
you're mean.
why do you say that?
you fire me in the morning, then you strut your stuff in my neck of the woods in the evening...
cruel and unusual, counselor.
life goes on, Hank.
so it does.
I'm sorry, by the way.
for what?
I know I can be a world-class stone in your shoe.
I make life pretty fucking impossible for those around me.
it's an issue. I'm working on it, whatever.
tomorrow's another day.
have fun on your "date.
who says I'm on a date?
maybe I came here to see you.
Really? Why?
maybe I was a little rash this morning.
I-I get it. I bring it out in people...
rashes and whatnot.
are you saying what I think you're saying?
depends what you think I'm saying.
that you're my lawyer again.
maybe. Tomorrow's another day.
tomorrow?
Yeah, there's not a lot of legal work
I can do for you tonight.
right, so... so... so technically, you're not my lawyer right now?
technically, uh, no, I'm not.
right now I'm just a girl in a bar.
hmm, that's funny, 'cause right now I'm just a guy in a bar.
that is funny.
well, it's nice to meet you.
Hank Moody.
Abby. - Abby?
well, nice to meet you.
killing bad guys is your business, and business be fucking crackin', yo.
that's right, motherfucker.
know who that is?
uh, no.
it looks kinda like Ryan Seacrest though.
what the fuck you got against Ryan Seacrest, man?
nothing in particular. The guy just bugs the shit outta me.
Why? This motherfucker, he works hard, make millions of dollars, and he got a fucking catchphrase, which I don't have, all right?
and you wanna kill him dead?
that's some harsh shit, Moody.
you got too much negative energy in you.
you need to work that shit the fuck out.
well, excuse me.
no, that's fucking Kali's new boyfriend right there, man.
Oh, she's got a new boyfriend, does she?
I don't know, man, but she moved out of my fucking crib last week, talking about she ain't comfortable mixing business and pleasure anymore.
what kinda shit is that, man?
did she say she was seeing someone else?
fuck no. But I know how that shit goes, man.
I mean, somebody gotta be tapping that ass, 'cause that ass is too fine not to be tapped.
and that Mr. Someone will get his motherfucking dick shot the fuck off.
Hey, you know, don't do anything crazy,
Sam you am.
you're mere months away from becoming an A-list "raptor."
what the fuck is that?
rapper turned actor. Get it?
no, I don't get that. I like it.
whatever.
fucking bitch just drives me crazy, man.
you know what, maybe it's the case of a nigga who wants some shit he can't have. True dat.
this nigga has often fell prey to that on some occasions.
I'm sorry.
my bad.
I mean, you know, I'm in the wrong there.
what you doing tonight, man?
Mmm? - What you doing tonight?
nothing. - Wrong.
you're rolling with me on a ride-along.
a ride-along?
Yeah, with the real Santa Monica P. D.
I gotta get my fucking cop.
really wanna be authentic, you know what I mean?
and I need to hit the streets to get the feel for this shit.
and you need to be taking some fucking notes, all right?
so be there or be six feet under, motherfucker.
you gotta go. I don't gotta do nothing.
good God, man, it's a ride-along.
at the absolute worst, it'll be an absolute fucking blast.
look, sooner or later this guy's gonna find or figure out that I'm fucking the object of his gangstery affections, and when that happens, I'm toast.
bloody, bullet-ridden toast. I still think you should go.
and I think you should be on my side for once.
you should be focused on protecting my ass, not just my career.
your career is just fine, buddy-boy.
you are the guy that got Santa Monica Cop a green light.
there's a dubious honor.
dubious or not,
I got serious interest in you for a whole bunch of projects.
that's great. Really?
well, why am I just hearing about it now?
why just as an aside? What are they?
I don't know.
I got 'em written down on a buckslip somewhere.
worst agent ever.
I'll tell you what, I will go with you.
keep you out of harm's way.
I will be your human Kevlar.
it's no problem, none at all.
that's just the kind of service you get for your 10%.
bullshit, you just wanna ride in the police car.
ever since I was a little boy.
you're here, you're queer, and I'm used to it, but you're not invited.
but I could be, right?
I could tag along for the ride-along.
I feel like crushing one of your testicles right now.
does that mean I can go?
fine, let's go, powder.
I hope you get killed in the line of duty.
this feels unnatural to me, voluntarily arriving at a police station.
I like it.
smells like crime, punishment, and the urine of homeless men and women.
where is that fucking lunatic?
hands behind your back, motherfucker.
cause you under arrest. - What the fuck for?
for jerking off on the job, Dr. Evil!
what the fuck? I scared the shit out you.
Hey, hey, do your Runkle imitation for Runkle himself. Check it out.
I don't see what's so funny about that.
it's not even realistic.
did you watch the video? It was more like this.
that's true. Commando.
Hey, what the fuck he doing here, man?
I didn't invite him.
fucker invited himself. Tell him.
I always wanted to ride in a cop car.
it's a boyhood dream, actually.
well, keep your mouth shut and your dick in your pants, a'ight?
a'ight.
a'ight. - A'ight.
shotgun.
so this is it, boys.
welcome to the jungle. Take a whiff.
sorry, that was me.
Hey, look, I'll be honest with you, there's not a whole lot of glamour to the profession.
are you kidding? This is fucking awesome.
can I turn this light on?
no. - Can I pull someone over?
and stop touching stuff.
come on, man, you're like a big baby.
Hey, that's exactly what I always say.
any available unit in the vicinity of Pico and 23rd, possible "B" and "E" in progress.
ain't you gonna get that, man? That shit's close by.
Nah, somebody will get it.
eventually.
sounds pretty unpleasant.
besides, I gotta babysit you bed wetters.
so what's this movie about?
it's about Hollywood's need to recycle even the lamest ideas in an effort to maximize...
stuff.
I don't know. I'm out.
I got nothing. - Shut the fuck up, Moody.
you're too cynical, man.
you need to look at the world through the eyes of a child like Runkle here.
Ooh. - Hey, yo.
it's about a tough kid who grew up in Compton, becomes a cop, gets transferred over to Santa Monica, and uses his street smarts to fuck up whitey.
so it's like Beverly Hills Cop.
you are correct, sir.
everybody keeps saying that shit. Nah, man, it's based in Santa Monica.
Yeah, it's set in Santa Monica.
Hey, hey, hey, Mr. Officer, sir, that guy is clearly texting while driving.
let's get him. Who gives a fuck?
who doesn't? I do it all the time.
I'd be a hypocrite if I pulled somebody over for that shit.
you imagine getting pulled over for texting?
wouldn't that just chap your fucking hide?
fuck, man.
what's your take on drunk driving, officer?
Yeah, that's a good question, right?
thank you.
that depends really, mostly on the cut of their jib.
if the guy's a real d-bag, his ass is mine.
he is going down.
and the same thing for a hot chick.
down on this.
Oh-ho! All right.
get a load of bad lieutenant.
Hey, yo, you ever shoot a motherfucker before?
just once.
kind of a sad story, actually.
it was a little kid. I mean, I thought the kid had a piece.
turns out it was an iPod Touch.
bet he was black. Was he black?
was he black?
of course he was black.
why do you think I shot first?
this nigga, man. Cop or no cop, man, he pull this fucking car over,
I'm gonna bitch-smack that motherfucker.
church.
Hey, Runks, get your shit together, man.
uh, I'm sorry.
I was just--I was thinking about little Stewie.
he's always playing with his iPod Touch.
he's got this app on it that makes it sound like a gun, you know?
he used to love to point it at Irma and pretend to shoot her in the head execution style.
that's adorable.
Jesus, there but for the grace of God, huh?
I'm just fucking with you morons.
never pulled my piece out on the job.
never.
not once.
too bad the same can't be said for Runks, huh?
I don't know.
Hey, hey, hey, who's hungry?
I can't believe this, we're actually sitting around watching a cop eat donuts.
I know, it's a cliche, but they're so fucking delicious, you know?
plus donuts got sugar and carbs, which allows for a quick burst of energy.
coffee keeps me awake and alert.
hot call comes in, I'm fucking ready.
you getting all this, writer?
you need me to talk slower?
it's all right up here.
fill 'er up, Dotty.
this shit is fucking boring, yo.
if I want to sit around and eat donuts all night,
I coulda stayed home and smoked some fucking weed, man.
Hey, you wanted to see what a night in the life of a cop is like.
this is it. I drive around.
I try not to get myself killed.
and I feed the pain that comes from knowing that I put my life on the line night after fucking night.
that and the pain of dealing with a messy divorce.
banging a fucking fireman. You believe that shit?
chick must really have a thing for guys in uniform.
Yeah, ever since 9/11, fucking firemen get all the pussy.
Hey, you see that chick right there?
total pro.
wow, how can you tell?
years of experience, my friend.
Hey, hey, how much you think she charges?
Ah, 25 bucks will get you some suction.
gotta wear a rubber though.
50 bucks, she'll let you throw deli meat at her ass.
75, she'll let you tase her.
why would anybody want to do that?
people are sick, man.
I'm just telling you what's on the menu with these broads.
Hey, Runkle, how much to tase you?
Hey, hey, Mr. Samurai, sir,
I've actually been tased, and it is no fun.
no, it is. - No fun at all.
it's fun.
that said, I'd probably do it for a crisp hundy.
Oh, yeah? All right, I'll throw in.
each. Each maybe.
Ah, shit, it's happening!
what's happening?
my heart. Another fucking episode.
God damn it!
are you sure?
Yeah, got an intense pain in my chest.
arms are going all numb.
something not good is definitely happening to my body right now
I'm stroking out over here.
you guys are gonna have to drive me to the fucking hospital, okay?
I'm calling my agent, man.
I'm right here. - My new agent.
now let's not be rash. U.T.K. is a unique agency.
our ability to package is unparalleled.
Hey, hang on, I'll take care of this, then I'll take care of you.
okay, 911 it is.
okay, man down!
God damn.
one minute, you're eating a donut, waxing all poetic.
the next you're stroking out all over the floor.
that kinda makes you think, huh?
about laying off the donuts, sure.
think he's gonna be okay?
I don't know, he seemed pretty tweaked.
I do know that he appreciated you holding his hand the entire time though, Runks.
well, what do you think, Sam?
I think we should add a stroke scene - to the script, man. - Stroke scene?
I can pull that shit off no problem.
nice.
we best be thinking about getting ourselves a cab, huh?
Oh, wait a minute, maybe one of your crew guys can come pick us up?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, call the midget.
I love that little dude.
that little nappy-headed nigga, man.
Yeah, Mr. Lowercase T.
Nah, man.
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't think that's a very good idea, Sam.
no, we could really get in a lot of trouble.
for what?
just gonna take it back to the police station.
Charlie, it's the right thing to do.
the moral thing, the polite thing.
I just don't wanna get in any trouble.
what's up, Adam-12?
I thought it was your boyhood fucking dream to ride in a police car.
and I have fulfilled that dream.
now it's time we should all go home and reflect.
shotgun!
Hey, guys, where you going?
whe
you're just gonna leave me here, is that it?
Yep, it looks like you're just gonna leave without me.
okay, okay, I'm coming. Can I drive, huh?
could have at least let me sit in the front.
I called shotgun.
there's nothing to do back here.
shut the fuck up, Runkle.
you're like a small child back there, man, and it's pissing me the fuck off.
boring.
this motherfucker driving all fucking slow.
watch this, watch this.
pow, motherfucker!
excuse me, but, um, I really think we're playing with fire here now, Sam.
I don't know if you're aware, but--but Hank has only recently finished his probation.
so
for what, being a fucking rapist?
Hey, stop it with all that rapist shit, okay?
I'm sensitive about that.
come on, man, I say that shit with love, man.
that's what I like about you, man.
you're an outlaw, man. Truth.
I prefer raper to rapist.
Oh, shit.
grab the wheel for me.
Yeah.
Yeah, you probably want to put that on speaker.
fine, have it your way. - Yo, what up, man?
what?
no, sing for nothing. Fuck that.
I'll be right there.
be right where?
my boy saw Kali up in the club getting cozy with some clown-ass nigga, man.
well, we're going back to the police station first, right?
you're gonna drop us off.
something tells me no.
fuck that, you gotta strike when the iron fist is hot.
Yeah, but what if something bad goes down?
you don't want any witnesses around, do you?
no, I do want witnesses, man, especially some white motherfuckers, man.
Oh, why, 'cause we're white?
Yeah, 'cause you white, motherfucker.
cops believe white motherfuckers.
you got my back, right? Y'all got my back, right?
you'd lie for me, right?
not if it's against the law.
you lie for a living, motherfucker. Man's got a point.
officer, I think someone's following me.
feel like I'm in danger.
get the fuck outta here, streetwalker.
can't you see we're working, man?
we on a stakeout.
no, that's not nice.
the lady says she's in danger.
you just want a free hummer, don't you?
come on inside here, sweetheart.
that's the way you treat a lady.
thank you. Ooh, my dogs are barking.
Aww. How's business tonight?
it's a little slow, actually.
there she is.
all right, all right, what do you say we just--we leave the car out of this and we proceed on foot.
stop worrying about the God damn car, you fucking ninny.
can I do it?
fuck yeah, go for it.
how come he gets to do it? 'Cause I like him better, man.
that's right, we're pulling you over, motherfucker.
pull over to the right.
what are you, stupid?
your other right, jackass.
there you go.
so what's the move here, good cop, bad cop, bald cop?
no, how 'bout bad cop, bad cop, bald cop stays in the fucking car? Works for me.
that was sweet of you to let me in.
give me shelter from the storm.
it's nothing.
who likes to see a lady in danger?
not this cop. Lieutenant Charles W. Runkle.
nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too, officer.
so you a detective? Mm-hmm, yep.
I like to take a couple of the rookies out on a 5-8-7 now and again, make sure they know their shit.
it's just good old-fashioned police work.
well, how 'bout a good old-fashioned blowjob?
this one's on me, 'cause you're an officer and a gentleman.
out of the car, ma'am.
license and registration, motherfucker.
come on, look alive.
what the fuck?
he's really pissed. He misses you.
you know, this is why I moved out of his place, because he is a fucking psycho.
Yeah, but we got to talk about this, 'cause sooner or later he's gonna find out about us.
how? I'm not gonna tell him.
are you gonna tell him?
no fucking way.
so we don't have a problem. Yeah.
now I know where the fuck you live at.
get out the car.
he's really kind of sweet in a way.
Hank, I know you think he's all warm and cuddly.
Oh, no, I don't.
I'm just saying watch yourself.
I am watching myself.
I try to get out, but he pulls me back in with the money.
and, uh, the money.
and--and, oh, the exceptional weed.
and, wow, you look really hot tonight.
you know, I'm thinking maybe I should handcuff you just to be safe.
what was I doing wrong, officer? You tell me.
turn around.
you been drinking? - No, sir, not at all.
not at all? Bullshit.
you was at the club, wasn't you? Step over there.
something smell funky to me, nigga.
smell like pussy. You been drinking pussy?
no. - No what?
no, I haven't been drinking pussy, officer.
what, this girl pussy ain't good enough for you to drink?
I'm sure she got a very drinkable pussy.
we just haven't gotten there yet. Think you gonna get there?
I think I can close this, yeah. Think you can close this.
what if she's somebody else's girl?
then I say that that someone else in question isn't doing a good job making her happy.
is that what you say, nigga?
Calvin, what the fuck are you doing?
this motherfucker disrespecting both of us.
wait, you know this guy?
you want me to call 911
so that you can deal with the real cops?
fuck that.
look, I want you to come home with me, a'ight?
forget all this bullshit.
fuck you.
wait a second, you ain't a real cop?
shit, you could have fooled me.
I'm gonna take that as a compliment, motherfucker.
I ain't gonna apologize for fucking your legs up.
I know where the fuck you live.
keep your hands off my bitch.
wait a second.
aren't you Samurai Apocalypse?
Oh, shit. - No shit.
Oh, shit!
God, you give an exceptional blowjob.
I mean, seriously.
something to be said for putting in the time.
have you read "Outliers"?
Mm-mm. - Malcolm Gladwell.
he claims that the secret to success in any field is a simple matter of practicing a specific task for, mmm, about 10, 000 hours.
what, you wanna suck my dick now?
what?
you want me to take mine out? Want me to put it in your mouth?
your dick?
buck up, buddy-boy.
it doesn't matter. You didn't know.
it doesn't count.
did you know?
of course. Didn't you know?
fuck yeah.
seen the size of that Adam's apple?
shit, do I look ignorant to you?
no, no, you look like a guy who could spot a tranny hooker from a mile away.
respect.
motherfucking right, man.
shit, this bitch Kali got my fucking heart on fire, man.
Yeah, I know how that feels, brother.
but you know what Sting says.
what does Sting say? He says that if you love somebody, you set them free.
sting says that? - Yep, he sure does.
you're fucking with me, man.
no, he says that. He sings about it.
that saying been around since the stone ages.
Yeah, well, Sting's the one who wrote a song about it.
you think I'm dumb, don't you, Moody?
no, I don't.
then why are you always fucking condescending to me?
I'm not condescending to you. I'm relating.
you know I got a fucking broken heart right now, right?
I do know that. Yes, I know.
fucking Jersey Shore ass nigga, man, sticking his pencil dick in my sweet pound cake.
Yeah, I relate.
you know, right now the love of my life is getting pounded by some omnisex chicken hawk.
doesn't feel good.
it could be worse. Yeah, how?
coulda just had your dick drained by a tranny hooker.
true dat.
it's not funny! Why are you laughing?
Oh, man.
Becca, hey, sweetie. I thought you weren't talking to me.
wait, hold up.
slow down, slow down, slow down.
it's back? Okay, I gotta see this.
we'll be there.
what's up?
we got somewhere we gotta go.
let's go deep.
you okay, baby? What happened?
see for yourself.
it was amazing, Hank.
it's the coolest thing that I've ever seen.
what? It was, I'm sorry.
Richard-- - Peek-a-boo, and fine wine.
come on up, honey.
come-- Get down now.
I can't remember the song. - Karen. - Karen
Jesus. What the fuck are you doing here?
it's a long story, and ultimately not as interesting as what's happening here.
what happened?
Tyler switched drinks, thought it would be funny to watch him get drunk.
Jesus, that kid really is a young me.
Hey, Batesy!
Hank, God damn it! It's great to see you!
I'm so glad you could make it.
good to see you too, man.
loving that man-gina.
thank you. It is fucking liberating.
Hey, you wanna come down and put some clothes on before the law gets here?
no, no, nonsense. I'm tucked.
you know, I was just telling Karen
I used to fuck guys like Tyler back in prison.
did I ever tell you about the year I spent behind bars?
no.
Yeah, I was researching a novel about prison life, so I knocked over a little liquor store.
the research was great, but there was an unexpected gift.
I fell in love there, Hank.
twice. Two very different men.
and we still keep in touch.
I gotta tell you, men in prison make exceptional pen pals.
letters like fucking short stories.
you remember your first short story, Hank?
Yeah.
finishing mine gave me a thunderous erection.
you remember your first erection?
Yeah, I had a big crush on the blonde from the Beverly Hillbillies.
spilt a lot of boy milk to that foxy little tramp.
Yeah. You know, thanks to that fine memory, the blood is starting to flow down south.
this could be pretty hard to tuck in a minute.
I hear you. - I'm going for a run.
give me a hug.
there you go. There you go.
I love you, babe.
don't wait up.
Hey, hey, hey. You want me to go after him?
no, I don't. Just let him run it off.
Hey, Tyler, not cool.
I'm speechless.
not cool. - I am speechless.
not cool at all. - I know, I know.
okay, I'm sorry, all right? I feel bad.
Yeah.
but, look, Becca told me all these stories about how crazy he gets when he drinks.
and, look, it was just-- it was too tempting.
all right, much as I hate to say it,
I understand, but
besides, he was being a total dick.
it's like he was standing in for you tonight.
literally giving me a hard time about every single word that was coming out of my mouth.
shit just gets tiring, you know, and I just hit my limit.
yo, an order of ankio, man.
is he with you by any chance?
who, that-- - Yeah.
that woman? - No, him.
Oh, him? Officer Dolemite over there?
no, I've never seen him before in my life.
yeah? 'Cause I'm pretty sure he was there the night I got my ass kicked.
Really? That would be quite a coinkydink.
you sure you're not just being racist?
you gotta check that
yo, Moody, you seen that fucking naked guy run outta here?
fucking dick swinging in some real white boy shit, yo.
crazy.
Hey, yo.
yo, ain't this the little Romeo we had to smack down at the club the other night?
Yes, yes, it is. Good to see you.
good to see you too. You're healing real good, son.
Thanks.
dad, what did you do?
nothing. I did--I did nothing.
will you tell them? - Will you answer her?
tell 'em. - Tell 'em what?
that I didn't do anything of that nature.
no, he ain't do anything though, but I knew it was important to him, so I took care of it.
that's what we do for each other.
I'd be happy to do it again if necessary.
it's not necessary.
let's go.
they make a cute couple, man.
I don't see why you getting so fucking bent up about it.
Thanks. That was very helpful.
cool, let's get some sake.
unfiltered sake, nigori.
I wanna see some new pages tomorrow, Moody.
what exactly have we learned tonight?
our boy Runkle learned what it's like to come in a tranny hooker's mouth.
thank you, Sam. Thank you so much.
I'd almost managed to stop thinking about it for five whole seconds there.
gargle, gargle, yo.
holy shit, yo. Check that out.
what the fuck?
Hey! - Hey, want a ride?
Oh, I don't mind if I do.
well, get on in. Thanks, boys.
who's up for a cocktail?
Oh, fuck.
I came to America an orphan from Cuba and was adopted by Pancho Duque, a sugarcane grower and a master blender of rum.
I married his daughter Isabel.
and then the time came, Pancho gave control of the family business not to his natural born sons, Frank or Henry, but instead to me.
perhaps was because of the blood Feud with our rivals, Joe Samuels and his daughter Ellis.
perhaps Pancho knew that to protect our family,
I will do whatever it takes.
and that is both my blessing and my curse.
I'm pregnant.
Rebecca and I are engaged.
congratulations, son - thanks, dad.
I had some plans done for a VIP addition to the club, so I need a loan,
500, 000 gets the job done.
I just don't know if I feel comfortable enough sinking company funds into something like that.
I'm still pissed about Alex.
you want the VIP room,
get the financing on your own.
how much you need?
half a million.
deal breaker. - OK.
guaranteed admission party with the hottest of the star.
I need the gun so I can rule you out.
Alex, please tell me you had nothing to do with this.
Yeah, they got blood in Santo's car.
lab guys are going over it right now.
Alex, a detective Hodges is on his way over here right now.
I warned you this thing wasn't just gonna go away.
little Havana,
Mr. Vega, are you sure you want to do this?
just get us in the door.
I'll take care of the rest.
Hey, honey.
Hey. Where are you?
I thought we were gonna spend the day together. - Yeah, I know.
look, I'm sorry.
I had to come down to Miami for a meeting.
on a Saturday?
with who?
well, some business people.
okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Bye.
he's in back.
he's expecting you.
the patient's name is HenryDuque.
Mr. Fauro, my name is Alex Vega.
I know who you are and what you do.
I need you to perform a service for me.
24 hours earlier,
I don't know why I bother coming to these events.
you always win.
Tommy. Good to see you.
welcome.
what's the point of being one of the top sellers in the world, when everybody says your rum tastes better?
the point may be all that money that you make, Tommy.
the ocean liner-sized yacht, uh, your fleet of planes. Good life.
Yeah, but it takes the fun out of being number one, hmm?
twice now in the last minute, that you are on top?
congratulations on becoming CEO.
so, how'd frank take being passed over?
he cries himself to sleep every night.
just like Duque kicks Nadore's ass again tonight.
rub it in.
it's not enough that Pancho calls me "Mr. Ruand.
as in,"Nadore's not good enough to sip straight.
you have to mix it, you know rum and coke, tonic, and anything.
I've never heard that.
liar.
Yeah, I want you here.
word gets out that will.
william is spinning tonight, and this place is gonna go off the hook.
I gotta go. Bye.
your "investors" are screwing with my inventory.
you can't take that stuff, guys.
Oh? We can't?
no, I have a business to run here.
well, little Tony Montana thinks he's a businessman now.
well, he's gonna need a briefcase and a bigger office for that.
you want to take that stuff, fine.
but you have to pay for it.
can you put it on my tab?
come on, let's go.
come on.
not quite sure why I'm here.
are you a fan of the blues, Mr. Bronson?
ray Charles, B.B. King, yeah？
no, I mean the real down-home country blues.
I guess,
I think it's the South's great gift to American culture.
I've always found it, um, insightful and practical wisdom.
such as?
there are two kinds of people in this world.
one gets away with murder, thanks his lucky stars every day, and vows to walk the straight .
and the other?
thinks, "maybe I can get away with it again."
so we keep an eye on Alex Vega.
let's.
so, where is the old master anyway?
he had some last-minute business with some overseas partners.
I'm going to have to fight you in China, as well?
a billion customers, Tommy.
that is a lot of mojitos.
should be enough business to go around, Tommy.
can I get a photograph of the CEOs?
of course.
come on, Frank. - No, no, you guys...
Treat's not having the success that we'd hoped for.
I think it's time we tried something much more...
wait a minute.
are you saying that those 50 pills he's been swallowing every day have been for nothing?
Amalia, let the doctor go on.
okay, how are things now, doctor?
the tumors aren't shrinking.
I'd like to start weekly chemotherapy treatments, see if we can get the upper hand on this thing.
what will it do to me, this chemotherapy?
most experience some hair loss.
excuse me? Why don't you start by targeting ears?
don't joke what do I care about hair?
there can be digestive problems, loss of smell, loss of taste...
no.
what are you saying?
Pancho, I really don't think you got a choice here.
we goto face this thing and try to fight it as best we can.
I said no.
you are undoubtedly the most stubborn man I have ever met.
Why? Because I want to live this world on my own terms?
and I don't want you to leave it at all.
does that count for something?!
I don't want to turn into some miserable, sick old man who no longer enjoys what he loves most.
tasting a perfect blend of rum...
or the aroma of your skin.
we'll find another way, Amor.
okay.
Hello, Welcome you all.
Oh, there he is!
welcome, welcome.
we're pleased to open our honor you and the international rum awards on this glorious afternoon, to honor the best and the finest of premium blended rums.
so as the judges go about doing what they have to do,
Cheers!
Cheers!
anyway or another, I may not be blending anymore.
don't say that, Pop.
I'm not looking for sympathy, it's just...
it's just it's best start the transition to a... to a new...
stop with the faces or'll smack you both.
what, pop?
don't say "what, pop?" to me.
you've both been thinking about it.
and if you haven't, you're fired.
it didn't seem right to bring it up.
Papa, you've been duque rum for 40 years.
and it has to outlive me whenever that day will be.
now, the best blenders in the world are in our own backyard.
it's time to find my successor.
the Acostas, the Garcias, the Sanchez, the whole King family, my aunt Lourdes, uh, the Reyes...
Oh, my cousins from New York.
you remember them, don't you?
from when I was three, maybe.
you remember people from when you were three?
I said "maybe..."
well, they're coming.
and Lala will be in the wedding party.
Lala? - Yes, his cousin by marriage.
you're gonna love her. I promise.
Yeah. She's pretty cool.
I mean, from what I can remember.
from when you were three?
eight, actually.
okay, who else?
let me see...
uh, I'm sorry, uh...
I was just thinking of something a little bit smaller.
um, you know, Katie, my best friend, maybe one more.
okay, well...we can talk about that later, because I do want you to see these floral designs.
they're absolutely beautiful, I know you're gonna love them.
look, I just got them, because I thought the wedding should be all white, and you can choose one color...
it's a smooth, silky entry...
leading to A...
a full-bodied palate it finishes with just a hint of...
oak?
no.
caramel?
no.
you don't like it.
no.
we need to talk.
now, Dmitry.
it's very rude to interrupt, you know?
what cannot wait?
this isn't working.
what's not working - this, our arrangement.
I'm getting killed at the bar.
and you know that that's where a club makes its money.
look, these kids, when they do the ecstasy, they don't want booze.
it's not good for you, but what can I say?
your customers prefer my product.
that's capitalism, my friend.
I can't have your guys dealing in here.
Really?
Yes, really.
I come from a prominent family.
we have a good reputation in this community.
I can't look the other way anymore.
I don't member your "prominent family" around when you needed help with your little club here.
I was around.
now you stand here with such disrespect.
there's nothing worse to me than ungrateful men.
nothing.
go away.
I have real business to do.
I think we may have to add another setting to the tables.
there are a lot of people coming.
it's good. Thanks.
has there ever been a more beautiful pregnant woman?
tell me that in six months when I can't see my feet.
I'd better get this dance in then.
I'm glad you're here.
I wouldn't miss it.
you know how important is day is to pop.
Hey.
he'll be enjoying these for years.
Yeah, we'll see.
that good, huh?
for the flowers, perhaps.
I thought alcohol was dehydrating.
Oh... although you know, if anyone's garden was going to thrive by rum irrigation it'd be Pancho Duque's, right?
I'm from harbour one.
I guessed.
I'd be honored if you'd give our new blend a taste.
of course.
great.
right here.
now, uh, to tell the truth.
we need to know if we really have something here or if it's more suited to yard work.
and who did this?
who's your master blender?
uh, it would be Terry Greenway.
and where would I find this Mr. Greenway?
you've found him.
like when?
Hey, will.
Hey, what' up, dude?
the club is looking dope.
Thanks, man.
come back next week, huh?
Yeah, I got a new single coming out.
maybe I could play that.
Yeah. Have at it.
they'll love whatever you have played.
I'll have my guy play it unless you want to.
Nah, he can play it, and I just want to kick back and watch the girlies dance.
come on, wake up
everything cool?
I'm cool, man.
I'm cool, yeah.
excuse me.
move, move, out of the way.
what the hell are you doing?
we're taking him outside.
he needs fresh air.
don't worry about it.
kid had too much drugs.
get out of the way.
don't worry about anything.
go back to your party.
I will handle this.
who is it?
Goldilocks at the harbour one table.
huh, a woman.
she's 12 years old.
she's Australian.
she's a genius is what she is.
and she's the one I want to take my place.
come on.
what are you guys doing?
Hey, stay with me, man.
what are you doing?
what am I doing? I'm calling 911. He needs help.
Hey, hey, stay with me, man. Hey, hey...
leave it alone.
I said leave it... alone.
what the hell is your problem, huh?
get out of my eye.
Hey!
let go of me!
that wasn't nice, Henry.
Hey, hey, tough guy.
you're starting to piss me off, Henry.
I got a surprise for you, Henry.
attack.
come on, get him.
get him. Get him, get him!
come on, get him. Get him, boy.
Oh, here comes that gorgeous young couple.
the house looks so beautiful. - Thank you.
it'll look more beautiful on your day, Rebecca.
Really?
all of this?
it's a Cuban wedding.
imagine all of this a thousand times over.
hello.
whoa, whoa, slow down.
I don't understand.
okay.
Thanks.
I gotta go.
what is everything okay?
Yeah, fine. It's just public affairs.
I'll call you.
Hey, Henry. - Out of the way, sir.
okay, okay. He's my brother.
are you Marcus?
he gets pushed around by these guys, then he tries to stand up to them-look what happens.
how long has this been going on, Marcus?
I don't know.
a couple weeks.
I mean, he needed money for the VIP thing, they gave to him.
he didn't want anyone to know about this.
he didn't want to worry your folks.
Yeah.
excuse me.
Alex... I screwed up, Alex.
please don't tell anyone.
no, no, henry, look, just rest now, okay?
what's up?
I've been looking all over for you.
I can't do this.
I can't.
Yeah, I know.
these... these award things are kind of lame.
I figured... - I mean I can't do this.
I can't marry your who family.
all these people coming and I don't even know them.
everyone's telling me what to wear, what to eat, what to say.
did you know that your grandmother offered to help me write vows?
it's not funny.
I... Look, I'm sorry.
okay, I...
baby, I love you.
and I want to fix this.
you just tell me what you want me to do.
marry me.
well, that's the plan, isn't it?
I want you to marry me right now.
just you and me.
tonight.
Alex, how is he?
not good, man. They really messed him up.
this Dmitry Ramanov is into some pretty heavy stuff.
he runs most of the ecstasy through south beach.
what else is he into?
money laundering, gambling, smuggling high-end cars into the U. S.
why haven't you guys taken him down?
Alex, the word's out that we have to lay off.
they're protecting this guy?
the feds are building a bigger case.
they're shooting for his higher ups in the Israeli mob.
while these guys put my brother in the hospital.
my hands are tied.
they set a trap for him.
they beat him to the ground and kicked in his ribs.
you think this is easy for me?
I'll be drawing a pension by the time the feds make this case.
meanwhile I got to watch guys like Dmitry get away with whatever before they retire to the Caribbean.
they don't just get away with this, man.
whatever you're thinking right now, stop.
now you've just been through a murder investigation.
you don't need any more problems.
my advice...
just... just sell the club, man.
I thought Alex would be back by now.
he called a few minutes ago.
he said the conference call with Che vrolet people is going kind long.
so, he'll be back.
well, fine.
so the owner says, "can I help you"?
just looking around.
because you know, he's blind.
you and I should talk.
I'm very sorry. Do I know you?
some of your people put my brother in the emergency room.
by all means.
have a sea please.
want a drink?
no, I think we should skip the bridge.
as you wish.
the international rum awards is proud to name as its gold label winner...
for the fourth year in a row, Duque premium blend!
as you deserve, my love.
they gave us this out of habit.
we know who should have won.
all right, well, then I think we go get her.
do whatever you have to do.
thank you.
thank you very much. Thank you.
so, Mr. Vega.
is business deal, what exactly are you proposing?
you and my brother have come to the end of your arrangement.
I feel it's best we dissolve altogether.
dissolve?
how do you mean, "dissolve"?
I will pay you back twice your initial investment, plus interest,
I'll have my lawyers draw up papers severing your interest in my brother's club.
there's one problem with your offer.
what's that?
you assume I want to give all of this up.
fine.
you buy my brother' out.
all right.
sure.
I' give you two cents on the dollar.
see, my understanding was that you were a businessman.
Oh, yeah.
businessmen's negotiate.
that's not a negotiation.
you're right.
it isn't.
good evening, Mr. Vega.
Mr. Vega, you sure you want to do this?
you know and I know this is what has to be done.
Mr. Fauro...
my name is Alex Vega.
I know who you are.
I know what you do.
I need you to perform a service for me.
I was told that you are a serious man, so...
let's discuss the...
the service that you desire.
you know how to play?
we can play and talk almost like we're back home, huh?
it's been a long time since I left there, how'd you come?
even so, it's gone well for you now running the great duque rum, I've been blessed in my life and yet you come to me...
because you have some kind of trouble, my brother got in with the wrong people they put him in the hospital , you don't want to go to the police?
they're useless to me right now, I'm looking for justice! Justice for my brother Justice! For my family! The coffin! Pass, I like your style, you're a good man you take care of your family that's the most important thing, you've won my respect today, you will have this justice.
Mr. Vega, that was a big favor you asked for.
Ramon Ma wants big things in return.
I'll do anything for my brother.
hello.
Hey, pop. Yeah.
no, I had this, uh, meeting abou the ethanol initiative and...
Oh, well, that's great.
that's wise.
Yeah, I got him.
our man's been here about an hour.
he's meeting with someone in little Havana.
Oh, well, that's just lovely news. Just lovely.
thank you so much for calling, and we'll be in touch.
sorry about that, and here you are being so patient.
don't worry. I'm just going over the donors list.
can I just say how delighted I was to learn that you were also a member of this committee?
been our two families and the Fanjuls, as sugar growers, we have certainly done our part for Florida literacy.
exactly.
here we are, practically neighbors, and yet we hardly know each other at all.
well, hopefully, serving on this committe will give us a chance to communicate.
I hope so.
I'd like to think at least a few of us in the samuels d duque broods would be able to get along.
my husband and your father, they just want to win at business.
maybe so, but...
well, why do we have to be part of the collateral damage?
Oh, you know, those late-night secret meetings.
I swear, you'd think they were government spies.
I'm sure Alex isn't like that.
I'm sure it's just my ornery dad.
I'm gonna go check on the silent auction.
I'll see you later.
this says take 1-95 to the 40 to Atlanta.
did you take 1-95?
I took what you told me to take.
all right, well, don't get mad at me.
I'm not mad. I just...
you're sure we can get married in a day up here?
Yeah. I told you, Amy's sister did it.
I just don't wanna drive all the way up to Georgia and we can't even do it.
babe, I've called the place.
it's fine.
a Savannah wedding church is where you and I will finally say "I do."
I can't wait to be your husband.
I can't wait to be your wife.
drive.
what d'you mean, she's a free agent?
she doesn't believe in contracts.
according the head of harbour one.It's against her religion.
that's not surprising with that kind of creative talent.
so where is this Terry?
apparently taking meetings all over town until she heads home tomorrow.
well, let's set a meeting.
we'll convince her. This is the place to be.
I don't think we're the ones who can do that.
and think we are. What is this, Frank?
come on, set the meeting.
you know, while you've been off doing god knows what,
I've actually been here, working, so why don't you just let me say what I need to say?
fine.
Papa's not about business.
this is not about who can throw enough money her way.
a free agent like Terry Greenway wants more.
she's an artist.
she wants to be free to create.
so a couple of guys in suits, we're not gonna convince her that duque rum is the place to be.
only you can that.
what you got there? - Nothing.
let me see. - no - Baby... - you can't.
why not? - Because it's bad luck.
you know, I never thought I'd be changing for my wedding in hotel room in Georgia, but...
well...
are you okay?
you haven't said a word since Galveston.
Yeah. I'm fine.
not having a... second thoughts?
no, m not having second thoughts.
we're doing this.
no. no! - Let me see!
why not? - Because!
really quick. - Absolutely not.
so much for our saturday.
I know. I'm sorry.
where were you?
I told you. I had that business meeting in Miami.
and since when do business meetings require a gun?
I checked after you left.
you don't trust me now?
are you in danger?
I mean, are we in danger?
no, no, no, no. Everythy's fine.
I'm safe, you're safe.
no, no. I have not felt safe in a long time.
you don't mean that.
Alex, you leave because you have emergency calls.
you're never home for dinner.
you leave without saying good-bye.
I've been busy! All the stuff that's going on.
This...it'll calm down.
stop it!
stop shutting me out.
I am your wife.
I deserve to know what's going on.
I saw you.
right there.
with Vince Grasso...
hand in your gun.
I saw you.
the one that was at the 4th of july party, huh?
Yes.
he's dead.
Oh, god.
Alex, please tell me you had nothing to do with this.
that's why Grasso had the gun tested to prove just that.
because he knows that I would never get mixed up in something like that.
you know me better than that.
you more than anyone.
got one of those for me?
Cheers.-Cheers.
I will never let anything happen to you...
to my family.
you know that, right?
you know tt, right?
you like ecstacy, Dmitry?
choke on it.
Yes.
of course I do.
I trust you, Alex.
Rebea Jnette king, Do you, take hme Alejando Vega to be your laeful wedded husband?
I do.
and do you, Haime Alejando Vga, take Rebecca Jeannette King to be your lawfully wedded wife?
I do.
Yes.
absolutely, I do.
okay, you're supposed to wait for me to tell you to do that.
may I offer you anything, some coffee?
I'm fine, thank you. - Tea? Oh, kiwiompote?
I'm allergic to kiwi, actually.
my goodness.
well, I'll leave you two alone.
ms. Greenway, thank you for coming.
she's lovely, your wife.
very spunky.
uh, yes.
that she is, yes.
please.
thank you.
so this is where the great pancho duque comes to ponder his next masterpiece.
ponder, Sure.
masterpiece.
I'm not sure.
please.
well, the rum judges agree with me.
well, they didn't agree with me.
I thought your blend should've won.
my blend?
you're very kind.
no, actually, no.
just honest.
ms. Greenway...
I want you to be my successor in this room.
what?
Mm,hmm, yes, you.
why me?
life is short.
when you see something great, you grab it.
although "grab" is not t word I would use when talking about you.
my wife as you say, is rather spunky.
um, well, I'm flattered, of course, but...
I'm not sure I'm ready for the pressure and responsibility of such an important label.
I mean, I'd be follow a legend.
we don't think like that.
were you thinking of pressure and responsibility when you decided to mix the yeast culture as you fermented the aguaiente?
you could taste it?
I've considered doing it many times, but I lack the nerve.
well, you were right.
I first mixed a lot of wine.
they were undrinkable.
Yes, but then you hit on just the right mix.
Yeah, on a night I was drunk.
when I've done some of my finest work.
can I ask...
did I taste a used cognac cask mixed in with the oak and old bourbon barrels in this year's blend?
now you must work here.
that, or I'll have to kill you since you know all my secrets.
I know it.
where did you come up with that idea?
I dreamt it.
you dream of blends, too?
not as much as when I was younger, but yes.
I need you, my dear.
someone who still dreams of rum every night.
well, not every night.
some nights are still reserved for Clive Owen.
it's a nice place.
your brother's a very fortunate man.
dmitry and his crew?
less fortunate.
they'll be selling elsewhere.
what do you have there?
the good wine.
great !
I'm in your debt.
we're friends now.
it's what we do for one another.
ay, Artie!
for a free Cuba for a free Cuba.
you know we can't tell anybody about this.
I know.
and that whole not wanting to marry my family thing?
planning a Cuban wedding and all that?
still have to go through with it.
does your grandmother really have to help me write my vows?
we'll talk about that in the morning.
all right.
thanks for not telling the family, Alex.
doctor says I'll be out in another day or so.
I'm just glad you're going to be okay.
because it could've been a whole lot worse.
Yeah, I know.
I should've never gotten in with these guys.
it doesn't matter, Henry.
all of that is over now.
what do you mean?
how?
it's over.
you never stop, do you?
we will have to keep myself occupied now, don't I?
what, with you tied up at that rum circus thing all weekend long.
it's called the international rum awards.
well, did you win, at last?
Yeah, I do.
well, come here while I give you a congratulatory kiss.
mom?
thank god.
what's going on?
she lost t baby.
when?
Oh, couple of hours ago.
I tried to call you.
we just came back from the doctor.
honey, you okay?
the doctor gave her something for her pain.
she'll be okay.
honey?
honey?
gonna fix her some tea.
you all right?
I'm not the one to be concerned about.
but you're the one I'm asking.
you know, Alex, I worry about you now.
I never used to do that before.
I should get back to her.
thanks f everything, ma.
Alex with her now.
this is...
I wasn't there for you.
I'm sorry.
but you know, we'll get through it.
I'm not even sure what I know right now.
I'm not even sure I know you anymore.
I'm the same man that I've always been.
I'm your husband, and I love you.
marry me tonight.
okay, you're supposed to wait for me to tell you to do that.
Hudson Bracks, this is our event chair, Isabel Vega.
what's the matter, couldn't you find someone pretty?
like it?
Hello? - Something happened.
What'd you put me in the middle of here?
it was you who put me in the middle of this.
three employees killed on the job and you're off playing ethanol games with senators now?
you need to take some time off.
pop... - go home, mijo.
no, no, no, no, petey, this is not funny, bro.
why you laughing, Chicho?
Oh, she's hot, man!
she's hot and she's good to go, and now I got to leave there with your ugly ass? Come on, man.
every week I got to drag you out of some bar, man.
you take the collection day to take to ramon.
why don't we drink after we give him the wad?
you can have the mama after we give him the wad. Petey, I get thirsty first.
stay cool, nobody gets dead!
you better hope I stay cool. - Shut up. Empty your pockets.
Julio? Is that you?
don't you understand what "shut up" means?!
empty your damn pockets!
Hey.
Yeah. Now lie your asses down on the ground.
what? - I didn't y please.
get down on the ground, bitch.
you don't know me, do you, bro?
don't try nothing. Don't you move.
come on, man. We got to get out of here.
mm, not now, baby. I can't.
there's, like, a million things I have to do this morning.
name a hundred thousand.
well, there are at least three places where I have to be at 9: 00, 10: 00...
not me. I got all day.
I can't.
that's not fair.
no, no, no, that's really not fair.
I'm supposed to have this unexpected week off.
are you okay with that?
no, not particularly.
your brother screwed me over and your father bought into it.
as long as you asked.
well, maybe it'll be good.
clear the air, clear your head. - My head is clear.
well, then clear theirs then.
you know they can't run the company without you.
can we talk about something else?
since I have this time, why don't we go away together?
somewhere romantic. - See? That's what happens with you.
what?
you get a little taste and you just want more.
I mean it.
come on. Just the two of us.
I'd love to.
uh, but I can't.
I have the wedding, the art auction.
I can't just pack... - I'm talking about a couple of days.
it's impossible. - Okay.
but you've always said that you'd love to have a weekend with your friends to go play golf.
why don't you call Alan or call Paul and see what he's doing?
my friends all have jobs...
places to be.
I turn around, I tell the cops, "who's got the money"?
whoever has the money, put it in there!
and then I started taking it out of my briefs!
finally.
look at this guy.
I was waiting for you over there at the domino club.
and I got to tell you, the caliber of the competition is a little lacking.
I can vener tell. They always let me win.
Chich, Alex. - You want something to eat?
I can get these people to fix you whatever you want.
no. Un caffe.
un caffe.
so they told me that you'd be here. It's okay?
it's just that all the terrible things that happened before, all the bad publicity you got, a little surprised to see you.
I don't let anyone tell me who to associate with.
so, uh, got some business to talk about?
no, not today.
I figure business hours.
I'm taking a brief sabbatical from work... a little vacation.
purely a social call.
gracias. - Thanks.
but I don't want to hold you guys up if you're in the middle of doing something, you know.
no.
our working hours are a little more flexible.
chill
I really do need to get away, though.
I should go somewhere, go do something.
la senora, my wife Isabel, she's busy now so we're kinda...
tell him about the trip?
some of us are taking a trip to the Caribbean.
a little r&r for my nephew here.
what happened
I caught a bull keep your mouth shut and you won't get a fly in it, jerk he was clumsy and careless.
he was stupid.
but you're not gonna be stupid again, no?
come on man gonna do a little drinking, some gambling.
have some fun and games with that ball of smoke over there sounds just like what the doctor ordered.
Pero, respectfully, I have to pass.
perhaps it's wise.
I...
look what time it is. I want to...
I got to go up that 95. - Thank you for coming.
Oh, come on.
pleased to meet you. Take care.
have a great vacation. - Thank you.
Hey, uncle what was that about?
a man who's maybe lost his way.
Oyeme, Alex?
papi told him to take the week off and clear his head.
so I'm running things in his absence.
wow, congratulations, man.
Alex did this to himself.
no, that's not what I mean.
it's the shot that you've always wanted.
so why am I here?
we've always talked about you getting involved in the family business, man.
Frank, come on, man.
look, in Alex's absence, I want to show papi how inclusive a leader I'm prepared to be, and what better way than by bringing his wayward youngest son into the mix, you know?
Wayward? - Come on.
you know what I mean.
no, you know what? It sounded Kinda cool, like I was a pirate or something.
idiot.
I don't want to be window dressing to make you look good, okay?
Oh, no, not at all. No, no no.
Duque is losing market share in that young hip market that you have the most experience with.
this is for the good of the company. I'm not messing around.
it's for the family business. - All right.
Hey, thanks for coming in. Hey, hunter.
grab a chair anywhere.
Hey, guys, Kim.
and I'm gonna get right to it.
we're not here for some thought experiment.
I want to come out of this with a plan that we can all implement that we can execute and turn this little dip in profits right around, okay?
out-of-the-box thinking, no idea too crazy.
Really?
Yeah, absolutely. Why?
that's just not been previously encouraged.
really, hunter? Well, that's one way things are gonna be different this week.
we're all gonna collectively lift up the hood and put our heads together and we're gonna fix this thing.
Hey, pop. - Good morning, everyone.
please don't. Please, sit.
sit, sit.
well, well, did your mother slip a hallucinogenic in my oatmeal?
no, papi, I'm really here.
good to see you.
well, you all know the challenges that are in front of us.
there have been too many distractions.
we have to refocus our attention and concentrate on our core spirits business.
now, frank understands that and he has my full support and confidence.
all right, that being said, I'll leave you to it.
Alejandro. - Pop.
everyone.
we weren't expecting you.
uh, sorry for interrupting.
is it okay if I get something in my desk? - Please.
the thermostat's a little temperamental.
you have to adjust it in increments.
it goes from meat locker to sauna like that.
this many people, it just may be hard to find the sweet spot
I'll see you all next week!
Yeah.
so, carry on.
Thanks, pop. All right, so where were we?
out-of-the-box thinking.
Ramon, Alex.
Yeah, that Caribbean trip?
I'm in, okay?
I don't know.
I don't know" being polite, rich girl for "hate it, now change it before I have you all fired.
swap those two...
move that one to...
that wall, and that one...
in the trash.
Oh, nice.
doesn't matter; we all know whose they'll be lingering in front of.
Oh, pay no attention to the self-involved artist.
"Self-involved artist" is a redundancy.
he's right. Flip those two, and we'll take it from there, okay?
thanks so much for helping.
you're kidding.
chance to help a worthy cause and score some points with my soon-to-be mother-in-law?
it's a no-brainer.
Hey, um...
that guy hudson, he's got a thing for you.
what?
no. No, he just enjoys giving me a hard time.
he has this "bite the hand that feeds you" complex.
I don't know.
Hey, homes.
Hey, pop.
how's the meeting going?
you know, it's interesting.
a lot of smart people working here.
I'm really pleased that you're finally taking an interest in the family business.
you know, frank is doing a great job, papi.
a couple of the execs commented on how open and collaborative he is, compared to Alex.
let me make this clear.
it is not Alex's style that I take issue with.
it's this meandering course that he's set: Ethanol, and feuding with the Samuels...
but I'm glad to hear that frank is gaining respect.
then you should tell him.
Oh, assist.
two.
Hey, babe.
Hey-hey! Look, you've come by to help.
here.
so, where's my mom?
she had to fly out on some wedding-related matter.
the caterer, flower guy, photographer...perhaps all three.
it's hilarious, all this frantic wedding stuff when we're already married.
your mom would crap twice and die.
Oh, my boys at the bachelor party would be so pissed.
what do you mean? - You know, kind of...
false pretenses.
you're still having a bachelor party?
tomorrow night.
you didn't cancel it?
why would I cancel? - Why wouldn't you?
whoa, why are you freaking out?
I'm not freaking out.
I just don't understand, that's all.
look, everyone has a bachelor party.
what's wrong with that?
well, let's see, um, for one thing, you're not a bachelor.
okay, nobody knows that.
except for your wife.
Oh, and one more person: You.
I don't see what the big deal is.
you think that the stuff that goes on in a bachelor party is suitable for a married man?
look, it is what it is, okay, and I don't see what difference it makes.
so you're just going to go ahead with it?
Absolutely.
fine.
fine.
Hey, what's that?
Oh, uh, I'm going to the Caribbean for a couple days, uh, in the morning.
Oh, that's great, baby, an-and who with?
some business acquaintances. You don't know them.
guys.
Yeah, ppyou're going on a vacation with people you've neverentioned before.
you are the one tell me do this.
now you're going to grill me fonot the third degree.
if you don't want me to go, you should say so now.
I'm fine with you going.
you know, I didn't think that I needed, uh, permission to go.
look, I'm sorry you're going through a bad time... I am...
but I've had a crappy day myself, and I don't have the energy for this.
so you go on your trip, have a great time, and come back in a better mood.
did I mention?
since you're set on having this bachelor party, my girlfriends are throwing together for me a, uh...
a bachelorette thing.
great.
they said they were planning on something pretty crazy.
sounds cool.
Amanda's had strippers, and it practically turned into an orgy.
anyone make a video?
there he is. There he is!
Oh, man, you swim here?
come on, brother, let's get you right into a drink.
Ah, little early for me.
Mr. Big shot ceo rum guy, you can't have a midday cocktail with us?
we didn't let that stop us, man.
Evidently.
dude, dude, you're on vacation, all right?
that means for every ten minutes you spend sober, it's 600 seconds too long.
come here, get my friend a mojito.
does this have Duque rum?
Duque rum it is. - There, you said the magic word.
wasn't sure you'd show up, man.
Oh, yeah, man, somebody's got to teach these guys how to drink.
Salud!
thanks for the invitation
now to the casino.
maybe a little new blood will change my luck, huh?
I have to check in first.
Hey, take Mr. Vega's bag and check him in.
no, no, no, that's okay. You don't have to do that, man.
Yes, he does.
Hey, this guy, tio, what are we gonna do with him, man?
he don' knowt he's on vacation.
you need to loosen up. - Come on, let's go.
I'm gonna have to catch him first.
Oh, here we go.
Ah, no prisoners!
no prisoners!
damn, if it ain't the truth.
the damn rich just keep getting damn richer.
what can I say? What can I say?
I never seen nobody win that much at roulette before, man.
that's because dude's got a system.
you know, in fact, I actually, I actually do.

when I place a bet, I always make absolutely sure that I'm always betting on the numbers that win.
you're a funny guy.
you're a very funny guy.
it's all luck and you always gotta give it back. - Come on, man.
look, you guys, of all people, should know the two great truths about gambling.
eh, Ramon?
one, it's a tax on people who are bad at math.
and two, you were even when you got there, man!
so, I, um, I'm going, I'm going to go back to my room.

I'm a married man.

that is true.
t buthere's married and then there's married.
and I'M...
I'm pretty married.
pretty married. - Married enough.
are you absolutely positive about that?
Yeah, I am.
hmm, your loss.
I imagine so.
is that what you're gonna do once I'm gone?
imagine?
uh, that would be, uh, hard to avoid.
hmm, well, I hope you have one hell of an imagination.
you know, it's too bad.
I don't get many that look like you.
you know what, here's my number, in case you change your mind.
who knows, I might even waive my fee.
I'm flattered.
Oh, I said "might.
well, looks like I got a couple hours on my hands.
you should call your boyfriend.
it's a girlfriend, actually.
it's A. Complicated little world.
Oh, uh, ciao, darling.
Bye.
I like gazpacho... gazpacho is refreshing... and Spanish.
this is a cuban wedding.
I just want what we discussed: The black bean soup.
what are...
no, please tell me this is not happening.
that you're not really arguing with me over a soup.
thank you.
well, I hope you don't ever get mad at me.
what are you doing?
your job.
you're welcome.
that's not where yours is supposed to go.
it's supposed to go where it looks best, where it's gets the best lighting, and where people who come to see a hudson bracks get the best view of it, which is...
here.
put it down, please. - At your peril. N't you touch it.
who is running this event?
that would be you.
the socialite dilettante.
do you think that's charming?
insulting people?
prominent person in society, usually affluent, often female.
someone casually and nonprofessionally involved in an activity.
exactly which one of those don't apply?
have you made your final correction for the poster?
I left it at the loft. I'll run and get it.
I don't want to get yelled at, like the soup chick.
no, don't worry, I'll pick it up on my way home.
you can leave things the way they were.
thank you.
excuse me?
yoheard me. - Yes!
by all means, listen to the soccer mom, not the man who's been given retrospectives in paris.
come on, come on, guys, we just hit the wall.
feels like the wall's hit back.
well, we gotta push through, henry.
we gotta... you know what, I'm gonna get some coffee.
or a twelve-pack.
that's it.
that's it. Beer.
we don't actually drink on the job, henry.
no, man. I mean, that's what Duque should get into.
beer.
workingman's drink.
something everybody likes...
think about it.
always popular, immune from fads.
that's true.
we're a premium rum company.
well, maybe we trade on Duque's reputation for quality.
I mean, there is a niche available for a mass market premium brew.
let's run numbers, some projections. Let's take a look.
see?
I told papi, huh?
you're not entirely useless.
forget about you and Alex.
maybe I should become ceo.
okay, yeah. Blind pigs and acorns, enrique. Come on.
let's get to work.
Hey, don't fall asleep.
you're going to miss the sunset - How are they doing? - Yeah, man. Beautiful.
it's part of the service here.
just like the fresh towels and the sheets.
by the way, thanks very much for my gift.
you returned it unopened, man. What's up with that?
Hey, it's the thought that counts, right?
and for the invitation, thank you. Again.
you're my brother you seemed like you needed relaxation.
I know, I push it hard. I always have.
for a man that has so much, you don't seem so much content.
Ah, I love my life, man.
wife, kids, family, I love my job, but...
I'm content.
as content as I get.
for some men it's more elusive.
you're not happy?
I have too many problems to be happy ah, not very, man.
but then there are moments...
this is one.
I guess our, our resistance to, to, to contentment is...
it's one of those things that, uh...
makes us interesting to one another.
maybe.
maybe.
I'm starving. Let's go eat.
you see, I always heard that losing really stimulates the appetite, - so that makes sense. - This guy...
you think he's all quiet and serious.
and the BAM
he throws you a punch but Chk ecthis out, if you would have won at the tables, then you would be paying for tonight's tab.
no, no, no, no!
that's how I roll!
winner pays dinner.
that works for me, man.
I hope you got a nice limit on that platinum card of yours, bro.
okay. - You haven't seen this guy eat.
Yeah, right. - Do your worst. Do your worst.
go for it. - Let's go.
Hey. - Hey.
you look nice. - Thank you.
so do you.
the hookers will be very pleased.
there's not gonna be any hookers.
sure you don't want me to come get you?
reeking of tequila and eau de slut?
I'll pass.
Denice'll take me home.
is that before...
or after the orgy?
I don't know.
interesting.
poster's over here.
don't be mad at me.
I shouldn't have called you a soccer mom.
I am a soccer mom, and I'm proud of it.
Oh, the other thing.
dilettante.
debutante.
socialite.
whatever it was.
I was being a jerk.
I think you're doing a great job.
something smells good.
it's our dinner.
threw something together.
little peace offering.
Ooh, that's nice, but, um...
I can't stay.
why not?
well, because I have things to do.
your son's on a field trip, your daughter's on a date.
well, yeah, I know, but...
your world can spin without you for an hour.
girl, you need to unplug...
have a glass of wine and try to undo that knot that you got in your gut.
how elegantly put.
that's why I paint.
come on.
I'm in no danger of getting my own show on the food channel, but I won't poison you.
Yeah, I guess I could stay.
excellent.
to Jamie!
to Jamie!
today, we celebrate not merely the end of your freedom, but the end of life as you know it!
to Jamie's funeral!
Jamie's funeral!
now who could that be?
right this way, ladies.
will you cheer up?
I mean, you look like you're here for a colonoscopy or something.
I'm having fun.
okay, yeah, you need to get drunk.
no, drunker than that.
excuse me. Excuse me.
can wehret t gee shots over here, please? - No, no, no I'm gonna, I'm gonna throw up.
well, it'd be a lot better than you being a bore.
listen up, ladies. Listen up.
for the use of this club, let's have a big round of applause for Rebecca's almost uncle-in-law henry.
anyways, guess he forgot to call the fire marshal because he sent some guys to shut us down.
but maybe if we show them some extra appreciation, they might let us stay and party.
come on out, boys.
it was good, right?
I'm never eating again, bro.
good news for the world.
means no one's got to watch you.
all right, give me your wallets.
you got to be kidding me.
stay calm, stay calm evening.
shut the hell up.
you guys just made a mistake.
and that's all right. People make 'em every day.
it goes like that.
but, uh you got a chance right now to decide if you want to make this the worst and I'm afraid the last mistake of your young lives.
I don't think you want to do that.
don't look at him.
don't even look at them. Just...
stay with me for a second, 'cause I swear at this moment
I'm the only friend you two have in the world.
okay, so here's what I think.
I think you want to put those guns away, go off and hassle somebody else.
that's what I think you want to do.
right now.
okay, okay.
that's cool. That's cool.
you made a mistake.
"the last mistake of your lives." - No, no, no.
your young lives.
you're a tough dude, man.
I was half scared of you myself.
oy, Alex!
say hello to my little friend, huh?
now that is a man's weapon.
that's some man shooting, bro.
I was in the service.
how'd you do?
you know, I'm always spray and pray, you know.
of course, for you guys, this is kind of a trade show, huh?
there are potential professional applications.
Hey, man, the civilian outshot you.
my shoulder, come on, man.
it threw me all off.
I'm impressed that you could hang with it, man.
those things have a hell of a kick.
alls I know is that this guy who seems like some corporate rich guy, straight businessman, ceo, man, he's for real and for true one nasty-ass bro.
Thanks, Petey.
wow, a man!
Oh, my god.
do you know who that guy is on the right?
Oh, yeah.
well, that's Rebecca's ex, before Jamie.
everybody thought that they were the ones who were gonna get married.
interesting development.
you know, I'M...I'M...I'M...
excuse me.
Yeah.
I, uh...
I can't...
I wish, but, uh...
sorry guys oh, you gotta be kidding m come on!
Bye, rebecca.
Hi.
Hey.
is this what it's come to?
crashing bachelorette parties?
women conveniently pre-loosened by strippers and booze.
almost as easy as a wedding.
Which...I look forward to.
so glad I can provide you with such a target-rich environment.
you don't seem to be fully in the spirit, exactly.
it's Jamie's bachelor party tonight.
Ouch.
be honest with me.
is everything I think that's happening there really happening?
honestly?
pretty much.
can I have another?
but I'm sure Jamie wouldn't do anything to disrespect you.
you were always a lousy liar, but I appreciate the effort.
you do all these?
you know, that's just it.
why should he respect me?
he's from this super-rich family... super-rich, classy family and I'm just this white trash waitress...
Oh, come on. - From a loser family living in a loser trailer.
I mean, you should see his house. It's like...
it's like a museum. Can I have another one?
I don't even want this. I just want to get out of here.
but I just got here.
I wasn't asking you to take me home.
I'm gonna take a cab.
I'm kidding. I'll take you.
you know I'm always there for you.
I just want to go.
now.
all right, see these numbers?
see what Bacardi's doing with beer?
I believe the term would be "cleaning up."
that's great, frank.
can I go home now? - Wait, whoa, what are you...?
no, it's not all inspiration, you know?
what succeeds in business is...
you weren't gonna say "perspiration." - No. I stopped myself.
can we get a ruling from our judges?
I'm sorry, our panel has ruled "intent to cliché.
you'll have to forfeit your winnings and let your baby brother go home.
no, no, come on, you're not going anywhere.
sit down, sidown, sit down.
I saw the light on.
Oh, so there's a party... so where are the girls?
only frank, pop.
so, look, we've come up wi a pretty exciting idea.
we? - Yeah. Oh, no, no, you're right.
it's henry's idea. - Oh, good.
well, okay, let's hear it, let's hear it. - Credit where it's due.
beer. - No, no, no, thank you.
no, no, no. Papi, that's the idea.
look, bacardi, they're making a fortune off the stuff...
it's a reliable seller, consistent demand, and it's free from whims in the marketplace. Okay?
now, mass-market premium beer, branded as quality, of course, by the Duque name;
and it gives us a baseline of earnings stability year-round, while we ride out this little boleomt and inevitable shake-out in the rum business.
so you two want to make beer.
Alex wants to make ethanol.
isn't there anyone in this family who wants to make rum?
you blew the pitch. - Oh, really? Oh, the expert, yeah.
one idea and, suddenly, you know everything about business.
are you gonna explain to me how it's all about perspiration again?
nice. I'm going home.
Hey, Alex, it's Brent at chevy.
I need to let my management know your sugar ethanol thing's getting traction down there.
call my cell when you get this, no matter how late.
Thanks.
you got the TV on, or what?
you want to go fishing?
not now.
it's Alex, man.
what's happening here?
Alex, you-you shouldn't see this...all right?
who is he?
who is this guy, man?
a thieving traitor named Julio.
thieving traitor named Julio who gets me shot.
me...
who never had a bullet so much as touch me.
he not only steals for a living and shoots my nephew...
you have the nerve to tell me that you don't know your coconspirators' names?
Alex, you're an outside observer, right?
you...
you tell me if this lying pig doesn't know the name of his two little piglets.
do you believe that he doesn't know the name of his two little hoodlum friends?
no.
let me do that.
wow, you even know how to do dishes.
I do the dishes all the time.
all the time?
well, you're right, not all the time.
sometimes I make my kids do them.
what is this thing you have with the affluent?
they're your patrons, after all.
don't remind me.
you know, people don't buy your art just because someone tells them to.
uh, yeah, actually, they mostly do, so...
they buy it because...
it moves them.
and they're lucky if they can afford to have this...
beautiful thing that speaks to them...
have it in their homes and be inspired by it every day.
it becomes wallpaper in a week.
you're right.
six months.
after they're finished showing off their conspicuous example of refinement and wealth, they quickly move to wishing for my premature death, so the valuation will go up.
are you this cynical about everything?
not everything.
I need to go.
sure, I'll finish up.
thanks for dinner.
my pleasure.
you okay? - Yeah, fine.
I'm not sure.
not really, no .
you said you wanted to. - Please, just take me home.
so that's why you came here, to get that guy?
man, I was kidding myself this whole time about you, this trip...
about myself.
maybe not the whole time.
good night.
my name is alex vega.
I came to america an orphan from cuba anwas adopted by pancho duque, a sugarcane grower ana master blender of rum.
I married his daughter, isabel, and when the time came, pancho gave control of the family business not to his natural-born sons, frank or henry, but instead to me.
perhaps it was because of the blood feud with our rivals joe samuels and his daughter, ellis.
perhaps pancho knew that to protect our family I will do whatever it takes, and that is both my blessing and my curse.
our offer will save you $135 million over the next three years.
if you want to sell, we sell.
but not to the samuels!
our family business will be divided three ways: 30% to go to each of my three natural children.
Alex will run the company and have control of duque enterprises.
Alex I'm pregnant.
Jamie, have you told your dad why you're not going to mit?
at the party on the fourth.
I report to rt benning in 60 days.
do I know you? - No.
who was that man at the park?
they killed lucia, pop.
the samuels killed your daughter.
I think frank's reasonable, dad. Let me see how far I get.
we can get to them again.
you have children, too.
what's going on, dad?
okay.
congratulations, mr. Ceo.
thank you.
to good health and-and success to the whole duque faly.
cut the cake, cut the cake.
Congratulations.
this is wh I want to see.
thank you, pop.
don't let menterrupt.
listen, um, I'm seeing senator barnes the day after tomorrow.
the government is going to make an announcement that they're ready to award a subsidy for the first ethanol plant in florida.
sugar ethanol, frank. - A refinery?
well, that'S... that's big bucks.
a hundred million.
the government's going to pony up half as part of the subsidy.
now, we want to capitalize the ethanol boom, frank. If we don't, the samuels will.
I'd like to have you there wi me when I make thatresentation.
I'm a duque, alex. Of course I'll be there.
okay - Excuse me, huh. - Yeah.
you have a minute for me, ser vega?
sure, miguel.
I'm sorry to hear that.
are you looking for an advance?
no, me and santo, we help you with your problem...
I want real money.
you don't pay me, the body that sappeared-- it can come back.
I can guarane you employment with this company.
but I will never pay blackmail.
blackmail? Never.
you understand me?
you've barely said a word through lunch.
there was a party at the distillery today for alex's coronation...
still stings, huh, baby?
you know, it's not my father's fault. I mean, alex just, he played him.
and I told pop that I would make my peace with it.
you don't need to make your peace. This is your business and your family.
your brother and sister gotta be wondering what the hell pancho was thinking making alex ceo.
t even their own blood.
don't be the good son, frank.
take back what's yours.
Hey, we goa problem?
so, uh, this miguel...
he is a good iend of yours, right?
Yeah, yeah, etty good. - You knew him in cuba?
we-we did a few things together.
Well,'causthis friend of yours, miguel, he... he just tried to shake me down.
he what?
he said, uh, he would tell where quinones' body was bued.
I wish...
maybe I make aistake with miguel.
so do we have a problem?
not with me.
Hey, frankie. - Yeah?
got daddy yankee dropping by the club this week.
Oh, yeah?
I'm gonna throw an after-party for his concert at the arena.
and, dude, he's gonna do a song from his new album.
nice. - What do you mean "nice"?
Frankie, this is huge deal for me, bro.
I mean, live performances. A lot of celebrities are gonna show up.
so, uh, I was thinking I'd build a vip lounge.
wow, it's gonna cost you se coin.
Yeah, I know, but we got money coming in from the family business and...
what?
well, how would you feel if I told you that alex plans to spend a $100 million on an ethanol refinery?
you'reidding me.
well, I mean, he's gonna try to get the government to subsidize half, but...
a hundred mil? What about my vip room, huh?
what, I should get government subsidies for my club, too?
40 grand. - Yo.
Oh, yeah, and that's just for the architectural plans.
we were unable to locatequinones, mr. Samuels.
there's no record of his leaving the city.
his motel room looks like he just went out for a walk and never came back.
there is information that he was evicted from your neighbor's, the duques, party on the frth.
but no one's seen him since.
would you like us to continue searching forquinones, mr. Samuels?
IndeedI would, mr. Bronson.
I'm ellis samuels. - Michael bronson.
you ve a card, mr. Bronson?
it's nice meeting you. Mr. Samuels.
who's quinones?
and why are we looking for him, dad?
just a cuban field hand that used to work for me.
so I tked to frank.
Alex is going after the government subsidies for the sugar ethanol refinery.
how far along is he? He meet with the senator?
not yet. And I'm not sure he's got his family's support.
play that.
we want time to meet with the senator ourselves.
get that government subsidy for samuels' sugar.
Hey, mom. Watch this dive!
good dive, artie! Looking good, hijo.
Hey, art! - Hey, ad!
Hey, is everything okay? - Yeah, yeah.
did you talk to jaime?
how you doing?
good. - You're wet.
how about some ice cream? Why don't you brinus some.
high five! Low.
I looked it up, alex, and until he shows up to boot camp, he can still change his mind aboutnlisting.
we have to respect his decision. He's made a commitment, isabel.
he's got pride.
Yeah, you mean you've got pride.
what are you saying? You think I don't lo my son?
you think I don'T... I don't care about his safety?
I know you do, alex, but I-I'M... I'm just sick about this.
don't be sick. We want a happy baby.
can you please talk to him tonight?
I promise you when the time is right I will talk to him.
okay?
all right, let me have it.
what did I do?
you know, pancho, when a natural born son is passed over, it makes for very bad feelings.
and I'm not just talking about alex and frank.
all our kids, too.
why did you do it?
Frank was not ready to take over the business.
Frank has more degrees than you c count.
he was not ready now.
then what was the big rush?
just trust me, I had my reasons. Just bear with me a little longer.
hmm? Do I have a choice?
no.
you threatening our boss?
I want what's coming to me.
he paying you more than me?
back off. I'm warning you.
you warning me?
I'm telling you for the last time.
back off.
Artie, let me get that silver one right there. - Hey, dad, look at l these cool presents you got.
all of audden, your father's a very popular man.
all of a sudden? Oh, thank you very much.
cool.
at is it? - Looks like a crocodile.
it is a crocodile.
like on the duque label, except ours is a cain, right?
that's right.
signed bbacardi. "From number one to number three. Congratulations." Ha, ha.
that's probably from the master blender.
Wow. Who's that from?
from the fanjuls.
That'pretty.
Hey, what are you reading this summer? - It's summer, D.
uh, yeah?
use it or you lose it.
what? Oh, my god!
what is that?
get... get the first aid kit!
son of A...!
Vega? I'm here like you asked.
you send a scorpion to my house where my family lives?!
you want money from me, huh, miguel? You know what you're gonna get?
get up!
I just heard about what happened. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Yeah, we went to the emergency room last night, and the doctor said that the scorpion stings like a wasp.
Sot's not usually fatal.
you sure you're okay? - Ye.
what about the baby? - No, the baby's fi. Thank god, it's fine.
are you sure you're okay with alex getting the job?
Ah, por favor.
because I kn that papi really hurt your feelings.
Frankie, but I need to know that you and alex are fine.
your husband and I are fine. In fact, I've got an ethanol meeting with him.
what? - He didn't tellou about it?
the feds are awarding a subsidy to build the first sugar ethanol plant in florida, and alex wants it, to tune of $100 million.
are you serious?
what does papi say?
papi? Papi's retired. No, it's all up to us now.
what does it mean?
I know that. What does it mean?
somebody's wishing d things to happen to you.
no, no, no, not someone. Miguel.
your friend miguel.
my wife got stung. My pregnant wife, santo.
is she okay, your wife? - Yes, she's okay!
what does it mean?
I made a mistake, didn't I? - No, wait.
Yeah, I sent two erra boys to do something that i should've done myself.
so miguel wants money. What do you want?
come on, santos, everybodwants something. What do you want?
eh?
okay, When I came from cuba,
I left my mother behind... worrying.
I sent her money every month so she can at least have an egg a day.
I want to bring her to the united stes.
that's all I want.
I heard that you came alone, too. Without your real parents.
Yeah, I was 12.
that's the ugliest memory I have.
being in the dark sea.
people screaming.
children crying.
I don't want my mother to come that way.
I have to trust you, santo.
do not betray that trust.
no.
I'll get your mother out.
I'm going toet your whole family out. And my word counts.
what did you do with quinones' body?
uh, quinones-- I buried him in samuels' place.
you know, in case the bo pops up, we can blame them.
what happened to the
I don't know.
with a florida-based refinery center, the sugar industry will respond.
etty much what I'm counting on with my colleagues on the hill.
and duque is the company to best run an ethanol refinery right here in florida, sir.
the senator's heard that claim from a few of your competitor s, mr. Vega.
must be talking about samuels sugar. Am I right?
well, how many our competitors have partnerships with the guys in detroit?
we're working very closely with gm on their e85 flex fuel initiative.
we're sharing research data, product information, exclusively.
well, that certainly bears some weight, mr. Vega.
so I have your assurance that duque sugar is prepared to put up $50 million of the ct?
it's some kind of partnership with chevrolet.
it's just another little secret of my brother's haetnol plan; I mean he's just unbelievable.
and he thinks he's such a visionary, you know?
he's, like, the messiah of clean energy.
how did the senator react? - He was impressed. I mean, alex is good.
you know, I'm just not sure that henry and isabel are going to go for spending that kind of money.
that land plan you and I put together would've made your family millions of dollars.
your brother's plan costs them millions. - That's what I'm thinking.
I'm just going to lay it out there for them to react to.
and then I think we'll both be very happy playing the 18 holes we build on this land, frank.
I may even take up golf.
Cheers.
familia, familia.
guess who's coming toy club tomorrow night?
Mariah carey.
Mariah carey? - Come on.
Barry manilow. - I love barry manow.
very funny, very funny. - Celine dion.
you people are killing me right now, okay?
I love celine dion. - She's marvelous.
ay, mami. - I love her. What's wrong with her?
clay aiken. - Who's she?
you know what, this isn't fun anymore. How about if I just tell you, huh?
okay. - Okay, you ready?
daddy yankee.
daddy yankee's coming to your club?!
he's my favorite. - What?
I thought you only listened to norah jones? - No, I'm taking reggaeton lessons with...every saturday.
I am really good. I am good.
so I can go see daddy yankee at the club, right, mo I don't know.
daddy yankee, mommy red sox, I don't know.
daddy, please. Look, I promise I'll read a book.
mom, you see this? Look, watch. Look.
we're spoing you rotten, kid.
can you please talk to him?
no, you cannot g every weekend you want to go there.
great, so...
how much money are we talking about, alex?
a hundred million dollars. But the subsidy would cuthat in half.
if we get it. - When we get it.
I don't know, alex. That's a lot of money.
I don't think we should be spending this kind of money.
from an investor's standpoint, there's no denying that ethanol is intesting. I mean it is.
t it's risky. I mean, what is the real durability othe ethanol boom?
papi.
my plan, which was to sell the sugar to the samuels, now would've saved us $50 million in molassecosts.
Alex's plan costs us $50 million, and that's assuming a federal subsidy that maybe we get and maybe we don'T.
now, I realize that you're ceo.
okay, alex, and, papi, I respect your decision to put him there, I do, but as 90% profit participants in this company, I mean I think you need to explain to us, you know, how this refinery is going to beny it meffamily.
that is a legitimate question. - All good points, frank.
and it's true, the money I propose to spend might not bring the family a return for several years.
I don't have the discretion to, uh, spend the family's moneunilaterally, although that's not my intention.
we can continue being a strong number three to bacardi, or we can be the carnegies of the ethanol industry.
permiso. Pop, I got to take this.
yeah?
Hey, mr. Vega, I'm at miguel's apartment. He clear out.
and I'm nobody's victim.
you find him.
that's very interesting.
thank yofor bringing it to my attention.
we can talk about the matter of payment.
I had a visit from a friend of yours last night.
Cuban fellow named miguel.
told some story about an old employee of mine, luis quinones.
told me quinones is dead and that you're the one had him killed.
the refinery, the ethanol; same as you.
my old pal senator barnes was very impressed with your connecons in detroit.
he'll be very disappointed to hear you're a murderer.
back off the refinery deal.
you gotta showe a little respect.
I'll wait to hear from you till it's my bedtime, and I go to bed pretty early these days.
you haven't said three words in the last hour.
you haven't said anything either.
nothing's bothering me.
nothing's bothering me either.
is it a girl, your enlistnt, what?
no I don't have an issue with the enlistment. Everyone else does.
you wouldn't be the first one to he second thoughts.
you know, I'm not afraid of dying, grandpa.
I am.
there's no shame in that.
okay, well, that's not it. - Then what is it?
I don't know.
how's ur hand?
okay.
when is the ultrasound?
tomorrow.
is alex gonna be there?
maybe.
listen, if maybe tomorrow you want to have lunch alone, it's okay.
no, I understand. - I'm sorry.
it's this scorpion buness.
I asked alex about it, but I just feel he's not telling me everything.
you know alex. He keeps everything inside.
you and pop have been married forever. E es hdokeep secrets from you?
he thinks he does.
don't worry. When alex is ready to open up to you, he will, okay?
Yeah. Well, I hope so.
pop?
well, well, surprise, surprise.
look, if it's okay with you, I' m gonna go work in the back, all right?
all right.
you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
he wouldn't tell me what's bothering him. You gonna tell me what's bothering you?
why do you think something's bothering me?
well, you haven't been in this room for two years.
maybe I missed it.
maybe.
Hey, pop, what was the name of that game you used to play with us as kids, the cuban liar's dice?
Mentirosa. - Mentirosa.
you were really bad at it.
what would I do wrong?
well, in the first place, you were to aggressive.
it's not about fooling your opponT. It's knowing how to read his bluff.
knowing when to call.
knowing when you're beaten. You play the man, not the hand.
how do you know for sure, though?
by knowing him better than he knows himself.
and letting him think he knows you.
risky business, pop.
that's why they call it gambling.
everyone, hey, everyone!
I have an amazing surprise for you tonight.
e king of puerto rico and soon to be the king of the world, daddy yankee!
No!
what? I'm 37, not 97. And you know yankee is my favote.
what's my mother doing here? - She just showed up.
I can't let her see me.
what did you take?
what did you take?
okay, go to my office, all right? I'll take care of your mother.
go.
it's not your bedtime, is it?
do you have something to tell me?
just that the duque ethanol refinery will be happy to process your ca.
I guess I'll have to call my friends at the police station.
you going to tell them about the little girl you had kidnapped and killed?
you and I are getting to know each other pretty well, vega.
here's a tip from your new friend.
I've got one.
do you?
me?
I don't play poker and outlast.
Youou-you, you my...
Katie, do it!
You-you-you, you my daddy...
stop her, stop her, or the baby's gonna pop out dancing reggaeton.
good morning. - Morning.
some light summer reading for you there?
every summer for the next five years. Thanks, dad.
pleasure.
your uncle henry called. - What did he want?
he said that 50 cent is coming to his club.
it's fiddy nt, mom. - Actually, it's curtis jackson.
how do yw knoou it's curtis jackson?
whoever he is, he's coming to the club, okay?
we havthe ultrasound today. - I'm there.
Where's jaime?
sleeping. - Have you had chance to talk to him yet?
he's sleeping.
doesn't matter what you say, dad, he's gonna go.
when he wakes up.
when he wakes up. Artie, we have to go.
Oh, man.
Yeah.
Hey, alex. How you doing? It's grasso.
what's up, vince?
you know that guy you were looking for, luis quinones?
he's missing.
we had a tip there's a crime scene, alex.
sheriff just ordered a tract of wild cane on samuels' land dug up.
uh, no. Just, uh...
I wonder what the samuels are up to.
the thing is...
they mentioned your name, alex.
all right, I'll let you know what we find.
okay. Thanks, vince.
960 pages.
this is Santo, please messege.
santo, call me, okay?
cause we do have a problem.
Oh, come on. Come on.
it's 78 degrees. Its a beautiful day, huh?
what could possibl be so interesting on that screen?
sugar prices in zimbabwe. - No, come on, really.
on this beautiful -degree day, I just made $50, 000.
yeah? You would have made $75, 000 if you'd put itn trinidad sugar.
Frank? - Yeah?
you ever wonder why our families hate each other so much?
well, your father's a stborn bigot, and my father's a stubborn cuban.
you don't think there's anything else? - Bitterness has a way of escalating.
like between you and alex.
what do you think alex is capable of to get what he wants?
I dot know, he seems to always get what he wants, right?
you coming?
there it is. You see it?
cubans and their damn pigs.
somebody was pulling our chain, sheriff. Sorry to trouble you.
Hey, false alarm, alex.
watch yourself, buddy. - Hey, thanks, vince.
where you been, Miguel?
Vega do that? Ow.
what do you want?
exile's a lonely place.
get in. Let's go for a ride.
I'll admit I was a little disgusted when you tried to stong-arm Vega behind my back.
but then got to thinking.
the problem with Miguel is...
he can never see the big picture.
I've got the vega kid in my trunk.
welcome to the land of opportuty.
get in the trunk.
get in the trunk. Get in.
Mr. Vega, what do you want to do about miguel?
open it.
there's only one thing you can do with a scorpion.
if I wanted to kill you, miguel, you would have been dead already.
I'm not a murderer.
I've got friends who smuggle people out of cub. and in.
drive him to the gulf.
there'll be a boat waiting with two men.
you're going back to cuba, miguel.
I would have cut your tongue out.
Hello?
uh, no, senator, uh, I don't mind a late night call at all, especially if it's good news.
Oh, that's terrific, sir.
well, I look forward to telling our friends in detroit that the duque refinery will be on line before they know it.
thank you.
did we take care of miguel?
I'm sure his mother's going to be happy to see him.
where are you now?
I'm on my way to the everglades.
you make sure even you can't find quinones' body next time.
okay? - I will make him disappear.
okay.
Hey.
put one of those up right there.
Thanks.
I know you don't want me to go, dad.
I know you think what I did is stupid... - I don't think th.
I fought for the country that adopted me.
you wear that.
okay?
St. Michael, the archangel. I wore it.
we just...
we just want you to be safe.
I'm coming back.
I just hope that I didn't do something through the years to make you think that, uh...
you know, to make you think that you had to be like me, because...
my love is a given, son.
I just d't want to disappoint you.
I couldn't be more proud of you.
okay?
we just want you to be safe.
I want you all to be safe.
you want to know something?
it doesn't scare me. You know, going to iraq.
it really doesn't, but, you know, the thing that's been on my mind really, you knowI just...
I-I keep thinkoug abint is, when I really have to do it, dad, when I have to kill someone...
...can ieally do it?
when the time comes, jaime...
.ou'll do what you have to.
my name is Alex Vega.
and was adopted by Pancho Duque, a sugarcane grower and master blender of rum.
I married his daughter Isabel.
and when the time came,
Pancho gave control of the family business not to his natural born sons, Frank or Henry, but instead to me.
perhaps it was because of the blood feud with our rivals,
Joe Samuels and his daughter Ellis.
perhaps Pancho knew that to protect our family,
I will do whatever it takes.
and that is both my blessing and my curse.
Joe Samuels was the one who had Lucia kidnapped.
I found out your little family secret, 'cause I know your father had Lucia killed.
nothing to do with... - No, don't waste your time.
stay away from me.
aren't you even going to try and deny it?
what's done is done.
Mr. Fauro, I need you to perform a service for me.
that was a big favor you asked for.
Ramon may want big things in return.
I'm in your debt. We're friends now.
that's what we do for one another.
come on, baby!
aces, aces, aces... No aces.
all right, throw 'em again.
come on, come on, give me aces.
not my night.
here we go, here we go.
Oh-ho! Hey... jevas.
never thought Cuban dice would be my game.
could've saved myself all that heartache at the poker table.
look, if you miss losing, we'll break out the cards, okay?
Oh, come on. The dice will turn.
listen to this guy.
little beginner's luck, and suddenly he's Mr. Cubilete.
man, I'm just warming up. - I don't mind taking your money.
the DJ will set up over here.
the main bar's going to be slammed, so we need a service bar at the other end of the pool.
I scheduled extra staff.
good, 'cause this place is going to be wall-to-wall half-naked bodies.
I went to one of these hotel parties in Vegas.
best night of my life.
well, what I remember of it.
hmm, well, it's too bad that you have to be the responsible adult this time.
well, I got to be sober to count all the money I'll be making.
Yeah, speaking of, um...
I was looking over our contract this morning.
found a pretty big typo.
I'm sorry?
we agreed that I'd get 30% of the door and 40% off the bar.
Oh, I could've sworn it was 30% off the bar, too.
Juliet, I've been promoting this party at my club for weeks.
I'm going to make your hotel the place to be seen.
I'll fix the typo. Good.
you know, it's amazing.
all these people enjoying the sun and the fun for free.
and tomorrow, they'd sell their cars just to party here.
you know, I love hype.
okay, here's an example.
your Florida distributor, late on his payments and really bad on his math.
Yeah, well, that distributor's been with my father since the beginning.
they had a change in management, and I thought that I would give them a little time to get their house in order.
Yeah, no time for favors.
drop them.
I'll take that under advisement.
labaol Carabina!
Carabina.
I'd quit while I was ahead.
man, I'll be ahead after I win all your cash.
who wants to up the limit? Who wants to up the limit?
come on, come on.
just you and me.
two grand? - Three.
let's go.
uh, here is another example.
DiSilvio Trucking.
they reported 300 bottles broken last month.
Mr. Fielding, I'm in the liquor business.
we factor into our budget a certain amount of loss-- breakage, theft.
there's only so much you can control.
you can't afford to look the other way anymore.
you got to stop the bleeding.
in business, employee theft is as common as a cold.
at Duque, it's mutated into a virus.
all right, here you go. All my cash is in.
one more to win.
Oh-ho!
talk about beginner's luck.
empty your pockets, man. - What?
this guy's got rigged dice.
come on, man, you're the one who wanted to keep playing.
you got rigged dice. This guy's got rigged dice.
Hey, hey, slow down.
whoa, whoa...
no, no, no.
time to go home, friend.
learn to lose!
that's my car.
not anymore. - Get out of here.
Dezi sent me.
Dezi knows I'm good for it.
I need a couple of weeks, all right? Tops.
I just need to make some things liquid.
look at it this way, the car buys you some time.
you know, I hear you got a couple of nice vehicles.
you want to keep driving 'em, I suggest you pay up.
just give me two more weeks, Dez.
Yeah, I know you like my boat, and I want you to keep liking it from afar.
Yeah, and I will get you the money.
Yes, I will...
I'll call you back.
I'll call you. Leave.
Frank... - No, no.
I'm not doing this little dance with you anymore.
come on, no. We're done. Get out.
please listen to me. - Get out!
I didn't know anything about Lucia.
I swear. - Get out!
why won't you believe me?
do you really believe in your heart I would have anything to do with a man who could hurt a child?
after you told me about Lucia, I confronted him.
he was so cold.
my father's a monster; I... I hate him, and I hate that he might have cost me you.
don't... - Please.
you didn't come here just to play dominoes.
the service you did for me a couple weeks ago...
I want to present you with a busess opportunity.
DiSilvio Trucking delivers Duque Rum.
I suspect they're stealing.
you make sure my bottles stop disappearing from the back of their trucks,
I will compensate you generously-- off the books, of course.
you'll be my unofficial...
loss prevention manager.
businessman to businessman.
exactamente.
Thanks.
you thirsty?
Yeah.
Hey, you okay?
you've been quiet all afternoon, and...
my dad's coming down from Jacksonville to meet you.
Wow.
when's the last time you saw him?
like, two years.
I drove down to the airport to meet him.
he needed money.
this sucks.
it sucks your dad wants to meet the man you're going to marry?
did you forget? We're already married.
he doesn't know that.
wait, he doesn't, right?
I mean, it's like he's going to come and kick my ass or anything.
your parents are going to hate him.
it'll be fine. - No, Jaime.
you know my dad split when I was five.
he never sent a dime to help out my mom.
he's a deadbeat.
I know what's up, all right?
he found out that your family has money, so now he's looking for a way in.
okay, now you're being paranoid.
no, I'm just going to tell him that I'm too busy to meet him.
so then when is he going to meet all of us?
I don't know. - At the wedding?
I was hoping he wouldn't come.
I picked up the place cards for the tables.
they look beautiful.
Oh, wow. Thank you.
why don't you check them out?
mom, um...
you know, Rebecca's father is visiting for the weekend.
she's a little nervous-- can we do something nice?
of course. That's exciting.
we finally get to meet him.
look , why don't we do something special for Sunday lunch, okay?
okay. Thanks, Mom. Okay.
Hey.
Hey, Enrique Duque.
what a surprise.
if I look out the window, will I see flying pigs?
what are you talking about, huh?
I'm at the distillery all the time.
guess we must keep missing each other.
I was just here at that big event.
Oh, how can I forget?
that was, uh, New Year's Eve, 2001.
all right. Well, I'm here now.
all right, to what do we owe the honor,
well, Papi, now that I'm part owner,
I want to be more involved in the business.
you know, in what goes on here.
Mm-hmm.
all right, could you hand me that bottle there?
sure. Please.
Yes, that's a good one. There you go.
all right. Here my dear.
thank you. - You wanted that.
Congratulations. You're involved.
is that a new blend?
it's a distillate.
right.
so, Papi, check it out.
I got them to sell Duque Rum exclusively at that pool party that I'm hosting.
excellent. Good.
Duque mojitos all day long.
you know, Terry...
you should come.
I'll put you on the list.
we'll see.
"we'll see" is what you tell a little kid when you don't want to tell them no.
well, your dad and I have a lot of work.
well, I'm sure my dad will give you the day off, right, Pop?
of course.
we'll see.
why does everything have to be so difficult between us?
cause we're not being honest.
and we're hiding on a boat.
why are we still keeping this a secret?
I don't know.
I want to start acting like a normal couple.
you want to go steady?
Aw, come on.
take me to the movies, strolls on the beach...
you know what I mean.
no. You and your father are on the outs.
this is the perfect time to let my family know how I feel about you.
you sure?
my father's beef is with your dad.
I know I can make him see this has nothing to do with you.
what about Alex?
he won't like it.
good.
so how can I be of service to the FBI, Agent Clark?
rosewood Investment Partners.
not familiar with it.
it's a Canadian company.
just bought some land in Cuba.
sugar fields, to be exact.
canadians in the sugar business.
thought they were more partial to maple syrup.
huh. Yeah.
rosewood is owned by Samuels Sugar.
well, I don't much concern myself with the day-to-day anymore;
I'm semi-retired.
Mr. Samuels, are you aware it's a federal offense for a U. S. citizen to do business with the Castro government?
as it should be.
none hates a Red more than I do.
that's right-- because you're a tried-and-true capitalist.
that's why you set up a shell company to hide the purchases.
those are quite the accusations.
and we have the documents to prove it.
my daughter Ellis is an enterprising young woman always looking to expand my fortunes.
but she's kind of sweet on a Cuban man.
likes to romanticize that little island.
she might've wanted a piece of it to herself...
so I think you should be asking her those questions.
Hey, hey! You guys good?
Yeah. All right.
wow
Wow! You should get out of that dark room more often.
you look amazing! - Thank you!
took us forever just to get to the guy holding the list.
this is Henry Duque.
Oh, hi.
it's a pleasure. - Nice to meet you.
I thought a party might be nice.
he's only in town for a week.
Yeah, I can tell you don't live here.
does the sun ever come out in England?
actually, Graham lives in California.
he works for JPL.
Yes, I'm an astrobiologist.
he searches for signs of life on other planets.
I have to search for signs of drunk people in the pool.
enjoy the party.
so, cheers. - Cheers!
so we have three possible locations for the fund-raiser.
when are you available to look at the spaces?
you make the appointments; I'll jt shuffle my schedule around.
okay.
well, next week is pretty open for me.
Isabel, we've been spending all this time together and...
I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable about something.
Frank and I are seeing each other.
Oh, my God! I knew it!
you did?
well, I didn't actually know it, but... yeah, I knew.
why didn't you tell me?
well, he wanted to keep it quiet because of all the animosity between our families, but now he's decided it's time to go public.
how do you feel about it?
well, my brother can be a very difficult man to handle, and he needs a strong woman to deal with him.
but I think you're great for him.
Thanks. I'm so relieved.
you know, maybe the four of us should go out sometime.
I don't think your husband will be too keen on that.
my father has his issues with your father, and Alex does too.
but that was something that happened years ago, and Alex has to understand that you're not your father.
no, I'm not.
Frank obviously cares about you, I really like you.
both of us can't be wrong.
well, if you think you can convince him...
let me take care of Alex.
mom says you're driving Pops to the doctor.
how is he? - Ah, he says he's fine.
but you know Pop-- his arms could be falling off and he'd say, "All I need is a nap"!
how are you feeling? - What?
you were sick yesterday.
Oh, you know, I had a little food poisoning.
you've been missing a lot of days.
what, I gotta sign an attendance sheet now?
you were MIA all the other week just, uh, you know, chasing your ethanol senator around.
don't turn this back on me, Frank.
that was business-related. - Yeah, and I was sick.
you missed the consultant. He looked over the books.
our trucking company's ripping us off.
okay, fine. I'll talk to Paul; I'll take care of it.
it's been taken care of.
so what were you looking for me for?
it's about Ellis.
I talked to her.
she says she didn't know a thing about Lucia.
and I believe her.
okay.
I said I believed her.
I said okay.
I'm not ending the relationship.
you're a grownup, Frank.
date who you want.
Oh, wow, so you're not even gonna give her a chance, huh?
she says she didn't know anything about Lucia?
Yes. Fine.
that doesn't make her an innocent bystander.
did she tell you Joe's under an FBI investigation for illegally buying land in Cuba?
what makes you think she's involved?
what makes you think she isn't?
Hey!
you can't win 'em all, Henry.
what's she see in that guy?
Graham? I met him earlier.
he's like a superhero.
did four years in the Peace Corps.
that guy? - Yeah.
went around building wells in Africa.
he's intense.
do you think my dad's going to freak out about us getting married too young?
I mean, my mom was kind of weird, and your mom was weird.
Hello! We're talking about something important.
I was listening.
Yeah. You have some drool right there.
baby right there.
babe, I can't help it.
these girls are practically naked.
and I'm wearing a potato sack.
you're the most beautiful girl here.
you don't think I'd ever consider anybody else, do you?
are you mad?
Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
I was just looking at that hottie over there.
who?!
that's not even funny.
what's going on, boys?
nothing, Officer.
no problem. - Officer...
Tranquillo, bro, we're not cops, okay?
I was just driving by, and I saw that you had a little something going down.
how much you want for the Duque, man?
I don't deal with strangers.
no? How about a stranger with artillery, huh?
Hey, hey, man, be cool. - You want me to be cool?
put the rum back in the truck and deliver it where it's supposed to go from now on, and then I'll be cool.
any day.
what is that?
Duque making whiskey now? No?
take it out of the truck. Put it in my car.
Ramon said that we had to take care of the Duque rum.
he didn't say anything about whiskey.
you don't move.
Hey.
okay!
nice office. Hm!
I love the artwork.
Thanks.
you know, I got something in, like, ten minutes.
what's up?
your loss prevention manager has a report for you.
okay.
they're stealing from you.
but my people made sure your merchandise arrived.
but I got a better way to fix your problem.
it'll be more effective.
go on.
hire me.
sorry?
my people-- we can be your trucking company.
Hey, I could use something a little more legitimate.
what do your people know about trucking?
enough to make sure that there are no more broken bottles.
and no more stealing.
I got to say no, I'm sorry.
I prefer to go with professionals.
you don't want to get too close to me, eh?
no, come on. Nothing like that.
this is a business thing.
business...
that's another thing.
uh... I heard something about your brother.
Henry, he's, uh... No, Frank.
he owes half a million dollars to this bookie.
a Mafia-connected guy.
half a million?!
are you sure about that?
I run in the same circles.
you know, there's a reason why I'm the bank and not the gambler.
I've seen what it does to people.
you can lose everything and everybody.
thank you for the information.
okay. Anything for a friend.
Marley... - Yes, Mr. Vega?
could you bring me copies of Frank's expense reports for the past six months, please?
I'll get right on it.
and if we go now to 28, which is what I'm suggesting...
Hi. Got a minute?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.
can you excuse us for a second? Sure.
we'll do this after lunch.
thank you.
how you doing? - Good, sir.
so I know about the, uh...
half million you owe.
what?
don't, Frank. - I don't know where you heard that.
I've found addresses of, uh, of meetings that you can go to.
gamblers Anonymous?
what, you think I'm an addict?
all right, look, I hit a cold patch the last few weeks.
it goes that way. It's gonna turn around.
I looked over your last expense report.
you did what?
97 grand in miscellaneous charges?
Yeah, I entertained a lot of clients this month.
so I'm hoping you have receipts for that.
Oh, you don't trust me.
I don't have a problem. It's a hobby, okay?
and it's none of your business anyway.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna get back to work.
I can speak to your bookie. Try to negotiate the debt down.
Oh, here it goes. Alex Vega to the rescue.
you and your frickin' hero coppers, trying to help everybody and fix everything.
I don't need to be fixed.
I am coming to you as your brother!
man, listen. You think I'm some messed up, pathetic kid but you know what, you're not perfect.
you may have convinced everybody you're a little angel, but I know the truth, don't I?
you got some dirt under your nails, huh?
and who got you out of that messy situation with the cops?
I came to your rescue. - You are an addict, Frank.
get out, get out. - We all know about it, and nobody wants to talk about it.
you're always asking; now you know why Pop picked someone off the street over his own son to run the company.
you okay?
I need you to buy my brother's debt off his bookie.
it's good for you, and it's good for your brother.
no, it's gonna be good for you.
your guys are my new truckers.
you can be persuasive with this bookie.
can you get the vig reduced?
possible.
half a million dollars, that's... that's a large debt.
I could arrange to pay it off. What would be the point?
with Frank's level of addiction, six months from now he's back in the hole... who knows how many thousands?
you know how to manage people with this kind of problem.
that's your business.
and if he places bets with your guys, at least I know you're not gonna break his legs.
start trucking for Duque, you will land other contracts.
especially with a recommendation from me.
Salud.
Salud.
Jaime, we're gonna be late for the movie.
come on!
Hi.
Hi, Daddy.
no, I've been meaning to call you.
I'm sick.
I don't know, just, it's strep or mono or something very contagious.
what are you doing?
I gotta call you back.
I gotta call you.
we're having this lunch.
your father could be... Fidel Castro and it wouldn't change how my family feels about you.
well, maybe not Fidel, but you get what I'm saying.
I love you and that's all that matters.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, you guys.
Becca, we're really looking forward to meeting your dad this weekend.
I promise I'll be on my best behavior.
it's not you I'm worried about, Mr. Vega.
please. Call me Alex.
you're part of this family now, okay?
Hey, baby. - Hey.
what? Hey!
what happened?
Frank and I got into a little disagreement at work.
and he punched you?
Yeah. You know. It's no big deal.
no big deal?
we're brothers. It happens.
Yeah, it happens when you're ten years old.
what were you fighting about?
nothing important. It's fine.
you're sure? - Absolutely. We're good.
did you know he's dating Ellis Samuels?
he mentioned it.
well, I've gotten to know her, and she's smart and nice and sweet, and she's very generous.
she works a lot with these charities.
Alex, they want your approval, and with all this fighting going on between you and Frank, like today, for example, I think we should prop him up a bit.
Oh. We should prop him up.
we should go out for dinner, the four of us.
you're very funny.
no, I actually made a reservation.
excuse me?
Alex, come on.
I know he'd never say so, but it would mean a lot to Frank and it would mean a lot to me.
one dinner.
I rode dressage as a teenager.
I even made Prix St. George.
you didn't tell me that.
well, my father made me take riding lessons, but I was never that good.
Oh, come on.
tell the truth. She didn't like the smell of the stables.
but I liked the hat and the boots.
that's the main reason I rode.
you remember this horse Papi gave you?
you called him Benny More.
Oh. Yeah. Benny More.
Benny More's a Cuban singer.
I hate ignoring the elephant in the room, especially when I'm the elephant.
I know you don't like my family, but...
I was hoping that Frank and I might be able to bridge the gap between the Samuels and the Duques.
I don't know about that.
that would be a long bridge.
well, I'm an optimist.
a glass-half-full girl.
well, Alex doesn't see the glass as half full or half empty.
and says, "Who drank my water?"
what's that even mean?
you can figure it out.
should we get more wine?
no, I think Frank should tell the table what he meant by that.
explain to your girlfriend here.
you want me to explain to her, or explain to you?
I think he means you're always looking out for what's yours, and you don't want anyone to take advantage of you.
it may not say great things about me, but... I can relate.
well, one thing I know for sure,
I'm positive this bottle's empty.
let me get the waiter.
Ellis Samuels?
yes?
I'm from the FBI. I'd like you to come with me.
what do you mean? - I need to ask you a few questions.
what's this about?
sir, this has nothing to do with you.
just leave it, Frank.
thank you for a wonderful evening.
I'm going to find out where they're taking her.
Oh, yeah, we really need to do this sometime again???
this is real nice chicken, Mrs. Vega.
Isabel. We're practically family now.
if you ask me,
Becky won the lottery when she met Jaime.
it's the other way around.
and she doesn't really like being called Becky.
Oh. Yeah. Forgot.
I used to call her that when she was real little.
so, you're all pretty rich, huh?
dad, don't be rude. Well, I'm not trying to be and they're not hiding it. Look at this place.
I'm sorry my mother isn't here.
she's visiting her sister and she would have loved to have met you.
say, Gordon, you think you might want to come and take a tour of the distillery?
really nice of you to offer, Mr. Vega, but my dad doesn't have time.
no, I'll make the time.
I'd like to see how the better half makes a living.
you must have been rolling in the dough back in Cuba, huh, Pancho?
actually, my wife grew up more privileged than I did, but we both arrived in Florida with empty pockets.
it's all about the American Dream, that's why everyone wants to move here.
my folks, they go back to the Pilgrims, and I'm wondering why I can't strike it rich like the rest of these new immigrants.
Mmm. Plantains?
Yes. Thank you.
didn't get to say good-bye at the pool party.
well, I didn't want to interrupt your make-out session.
she's nothing serious.
I'm guessing none of your relationships are serious.
actually, it doesn't appear that you take much seriously at all.
that's not true.
well, you don't seem terribly interested in the family rum business.
well, that's because Alex and Frank are into it.
me, I want to do my own thing.
throwing pool parties?
Hey, you went to it.
Yes, but I went home.
you party 24 hours.
why are you making me work so hard?
I bet you just flash those dimples, and the panties just drop.
am I right?
happy blending.
so, Gordon, tell me, what do you do for a living?
a little of this, a little of that.
nothing seems to stick.
I don't like to stay in one place too long.
Really?
why is that?
I like my freedom.
it's in my nature, I guess.
so you choose to be free instead of taking care of your little girl?
please stop.
son, Gordon is a guest in our house-- you're out of line.
it's just a question.
I think Jamie here wants to get something off his chest.
you had a responsibility to Rebecca.
why didn't you ever send her any money?
never had none. Wish I did, but it's not like I never thought about 'em.
you didn't think about maybe trying to get a job?
Jaime, callate.
see, it's easy for you, Jaime.
you'll inherit all this, and you'll never have to work a day in your life.
maybe when you head off to the Army, you'll finally see how real people make a living.
real people take care of their families.
excuse me.
Oh... en mi casa, no.
you know how hard this was for me.
why would you make it any worse?
babe, he's been talking about money all afternoon.
you said it yourself.
the loser's looking for an angle.
did you just call my father a loser?
you call him that all the time.
Yeah, but he's my father!
I can call him whatever I want.
I'm sorry. Hey, really, I am.
but what's the big deal about us having money anyway?
it's not like we're snobs.
no, no. You are humble.
but you also take it all for granted.
you're never going to understand what it's like to barely get by every day.
Rebecca... - When you don't have money, that's all you think about.
when and where and how?
and that's how I was brought up.
that's all my father knows.
you're not taking my boat, Dezi.
Frankie - No I freed up some cash, man.
I got it in the bank. - Don't worry about it.
it's all been taken care of.
Ramon Fauro settled your account.
who the hell is Ramon Fauro?
ask your brother.
listen, Frankie, I can't take your action no more.
Oh, come on. You're cutting me off?
you want to place a bet, I got a new guy for you.
I'm sure he likes boats, too.
what kind of a man throws his own child to the wolves?
you seem upset, Ellis.
you're trying to pin this on me!
I take it the Federal Bureau paid you a visit.
you know I had nothing to do with those land deals.
I thought she'd be done throwing tantrums at her age.
daddy.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave, darling.
we really shouldn't speak from here on without lawyers present.
well, this looks pretty good.
Santa Cruz Trucking - If we could switch this to 11: 30, - Yes
that would be great.
can I, uh...
Thanks.
I'm out sick one day, and you fire our truckers.
I would have liked to have weighed in on that decision.
I told you they were stealing.
I asked around about this Santa Cruz Trucking.
Ramon Fauro has got ties to it.
he's a bolitero-- he runs numbers all over Miami.
did you know that? - Yep.
Yeah. And you asked him to make my debt disappear.
I was doing what was best for you.
Oh... Thanks.
so you get in bed with a gambling syndicate while you criticize me, huh?
they deliver our rum. Nothing else.
I'm going to pay you back every penny, Alex,
just stay out of my business, okay?
Frank, what you do privately is up to you.
but, from now on, your business expenses
they come through me.
you're the boss.
mom, don't start with the lecture.
I screwed up yesterday.
I just... I couldn't help it.
the way he was talking, I wanted to knock him out.
Oh. Well, that would have made the wedding very awkward.
Rebecca deserved better from him.
Yeah. You're right.
you know, your father is a very lucky man.
he could have ended up on the streets if your grandparents hadn't adopted him.
Yeah, but even if they hadn't adopted him, he would have made his own way.
he was also lucky to be born smart, ambitious, good-natured, handsome.
Gordon's unlucky in who he is as a person, and you can't blame him for that.
you have to be more forgiving of people's flaws.
life isn't so black and white.
Hi.
my shift starts in five minutes.
all right. I won't keep you long.
I just...
there's a good chance I won't be at your wedding.
I don't think you want me there anyway.
I embarrassed you the other day.
I'm sorry.
what's this?
it's just a safety net, in case things don't work out with Jaime.
dad, why do you have to say that?
listen to me. I know what I'm talking about, all right?
his family, they're rich and powerful.
classy people.
what if he wakes up one day and realizes that he made a mistake?
what if he regrets marrying this non-Cuban girl from the other side of the tracks?
just take it.
I love you, honey.
daddy? - Yeah?
Where's Grandpa's watch?
you never take it off.
don't need it no more.
got the time on my cell phone.
daddy, thank you!
hello.
Yeah, hi. Dezi gave me your number.
I'm Frank Duque. Yeah. Dezi.
Yeah. He said I could place a couple of bets with you.
what do you need?
the Dolphins game. What's the spread?
three and a half.
okay, I'll take that for $30, 000.
Aha. Hanging with the birds again, huh?
Hey, mijo.
so, how was the party?
all the kids have fun? Hmm? - Kids?
it was a pool party, wasn't it?
I'm assuming there were children.
papi, it wasn't that kind of party.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, Papi, you work with Terry.
give me a tip on how to land her.
a tip?
all right.
well, I've observed that you are unsuccessful with women.
unsuccessful? Me?
no, you must have the wrong child.
hand me those seeds, mijo.
you're sure you're not talking about Frank?
Oh, you're successful in getting them into your bed, but getting into their hearts, that's anothe matter.
it's not just about sex, Papi.
I talk to them.
before your mother and I were married, she was being courted by one of the richest and handsomest man in Havana.
a Doctor...
anyway, one time, I saw them eating ice cream at Coppelia.
he spent the entire time, scanning the room.
preening like a bird for all the ladies.
not once did he really look at Amalia.
so, one day, I waited for her after ballet class, and I convinced her to let me walk her home.
and as we walked, I described what I remembered from the ice cream parlor.
how she was sitting with her legs crossed at the ankles.
her delicate hand on her cheek.
a rose-colored dress which matched her lipstick.
how, when she smiled, my heart came to a stop.
so I was paying attention, mijo.
I appreciated the details.
Terry is a rum blender.
with her, it's all about the details.
would you like a glass of wine? - What are you doing?
what do you mean?
dating Frank. Cozying up to my wife.
I care for Frank.
and Isabel and I share similar interests.
Ellis... - Helping others.
stay away from her.
Isabel reached out to me.
she seems so lonely, Alex.
you'll do anything to get into the Duque family.
I admit I do have a fondness for your family.
there was a time I was especially fond of you.
and you of me.
why do you hate me so much? - I don't trust you.
you used to be so sweet to me.
that was a long time ago.
the past is dead.
gets my very special surprise wedding gift.
Jaime!
you gonna shoot me
right here and now?
don't I get one last request?
911. What is your emergency?
Yes, a man's been shot.
283 brosten lane.
283 brosten.
and I think you should hurry.
hang on.
I'm touched, Vega.
no, I want you to make it.
I want you to make it so you can rot the rest
of your miserable life away in the penitentiary for arson
and the attempted murder of my son.
afraid you're gonna be disappointed.
at least it wasn't you, Vega.
I can die happy
knowing you didn't get that satisfaction.
you... grasping, jumped up, Cuban trash.
I'd like to say "go to hell," Joe.
but I can see that you're already on your way.
turn over and try to relax.
there's a little something to remember me by.
I hope it hurts, Joe.
I hope it hurts real bad.
all the way down.
hands up!
step away from the body. shots came from over here.
step away from the body, sir. hands where I can see them.
Hey, I didn't shoot him.
nobody said you did. But I need those hands in the air.
officer, this happened, like, minutes ago.
shouldn't you guys be out there
trying to figure out who did this?
sir, I'm going to ask that you
remain silent and please keep your hands high.
what's this?
that would be a gun.
which sn't been fired
because it isn't the murder weapon
because I didn't shoot him, someone else did
with some other gun from somewhere over there.
and while you are wasting time
frisking me
he is getting his ass away.
he? You saw the shooter?
Aw, man. no.
Alex, what are you doing here? Vince...
Joe Samuels was shot. He's dead.
could you tell these guys to go out there
and find out who did it?
Yeah, it's okay, I got this.
just search the grounds.
the shots came from somewhere over there.
there was three
or four.
four of them.
Alex, why are you here?
because Joe Samuels set fire to our cane
nearly killing my son on his wedding day.
sounds like motive to me. does it?
Oops, well, you got me.
I came here to confront him.
so Why the gun?
cause I had no reason to think that he'd
be happy to see me. Was he?
he was overjoyed.
keep cracking wise, pal. It's a good way to make friends.
I don't know, Vince. I was gonna hold him here,
make a citizen's arrest. shoot him?
I'm not a murderer, okay?
funny.
that's not what I hear.
Alex, how'd you get the blood on your shirt?
he, uh, spit on me.
well, now, see, why would I think you'd shoot him?
Yeah, well, you know, we weren't barbecue buddies.
but that's not exactly news around town. all right, so...
you came to confront him. Tell about that.
I came in, I accused him of the arson.
he, uh...
I don't exactly remember what he said.
we had words, certainly.
words? yes, shouted,
argued. is English not
your first language? Alex...
okay.
we argued.
we were yelling.
I don't know, Vince, and then the shots came.
well, then what did you do?
I was actually... I was afraid
for a second because I thought whoever it was might shoot me.
because I thought whoever it was might shoot me.
and then I got it back together.
I called 911 for an ambulance,
and I guess that's when they called you.
T1 and Samuels?
uh, he was still alive at that point.
I, uh...
I tried to use my jacket to stop his bleeding.
we had more words.
that's when he spit on you.
Yeah.
Yeah, and then he died.
you didn't maybe help him along, did you?
Hey. Alex, 911 didn't call us.
we got a call a good five minutes before that.
saying some guy fitting your description
just shot Joe Samuels. well, that's obviously
the killer trying to cover his tracks.
found this. Recently fired.
I don't know how that got here, man.
that gun was in my safe. This is your gun, isn't it, Alex?
look at me. I swear to you...
.9 millimeter.
what do you want to bet
it matches that sig. okay.
okay.
the killer is looking to frame me somehow.
that's pretty obvious.
Alex Vega...
you have the right to remain silent.
you're kidding me, right? anything you say can
and will be used against you in a court of law.
the real shooter is getting away right now. you have the right to speak
to an attorney, the right to have an attorney present come on, Vince.
during any questioning. You know I didn't kill him.
if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be
provided for you. do you understand these rights?
you're making a mistake.
do you understand?
well, you can use my desk.
just dial nine.
Hello? It's me.
Alex, where are you?
I'm at the police station with Vince Grasso.
Joe Samuels was shot.
Oh, my god.
is he...? He's dead.
What?!
what are you doing
honey... at the police station?
I need for you to call Moises Greenberg.
Alex. Moises...
needs to call the best criminal attorney he knows.
Oh, my god.
wake whoever it is up if he's asleep
and have him come down here right away.
they think you did it?
this is a misunderstanding that I'm going to clear up.
but, uh... meanwhile, I need for you to do this for me.
okay?
okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
okay.
come on, let's go talk.
go ahead, have a seat.
Hey, can I get you someing?
let's just get through this please.
this is gonna take as long as it takes.
you should plan on getting thirsty.
I'll risk it.
okay.
what was your relationship with Joe Samuels?
you know what it was.
we were neighbors.
friendly neighbors?
not particularly.
enemies?
I don't know, he had men kidnap
and kill my adopted sister,
threaten my own boy, burned the family sugar cane,
almost resulting in the death of my other son.
would you call that enemies?
enough to make you want to kill him?
Oh, I wanted to, make no mistake.
but I didn't.
you say that like you almost regret it.
what was your gun doing at the scene, Alex?
I have no idea.
and you know what, you don't either.
because you're wasting this time talking to the man
that did not do this. oh, why don't we cut
the crap? you've been in here before
accused of another murder
of a man you alleged killed your sister.
alleged? and we had to let you go.
because I had nothing to do with that.
because we couldn't prove you did.
what I said. no, you said you had nothing to do with it,
which we could not prove was untrue.
but which we did not for one second believe.
and we don't believe you now.
we don't?
I don't.
you calling me a liar?
you don't want me to call you a liar, Alex,
you're gonna have to stop lying to me.
you and the children have to come here and sleep tonight.
all right.
all right, but you, uh...
you call if you hear anything else.
love you.
okay, bye.
motive, opportunity, your gun...
that we all know ballistics is gonna show
was the murder weapon.
see, this is what we in the law enforcement game call "open and shut
killed one million member, threatened others.
burned down your land. Crime of passion.
justifiable homicide. no one's saying you're getting off,
but plead this down to manslaughter.
I don't know, a sympathetic jury.
just make sure you pick one's got kids.
thanks for that jury selection insight, detective.
you don't mind if I don't deem it billable.
I'm Mr. vega's attorney, and this conversation is over.
and there will be no subsequent sequels or reprises,
casual or otherwise, without myself being present.
you pass on the street, you don't so much as nod
hello without first calling, and waiting for me.
you dream of my client,
you make damn sure you also conjure this face
in your slumbers. are we clear?
great.
Constance hughes. nice to meet you.
I've arrange bail. You're free to go.
pleasure, detectives.
thanks for coming.
no need for gratitude.
you're paying me a fortune.
I didn't do it.
I assume that's what we're going with.
no, I mean really.
I didn't.
I don't care.
your wife's waiting.
did you do this?
you know I didn't do this.
I don't know.
that's why I'm asking.
okay, stop.
stop, stop, stop. stop.
listen.
I will never lie to you,
mislead you, shade,
or conceal the truth from you ever again.
as long as we both live on this earth.
I did not shoot Joe Samuels.
then this will be fine.
Jaime, under no circumstances are you to fly home.
you're on your honeymoon.
I just wanted to call and let you know, in case I made the news.
your mom is fine; I'm fine.
Katie is, uh, still going to go to new york tomorrow
with that, uh, model u. n. group.
so, you know, life goes on as normal.
Yeah.
I just want you to put this out of your head, okay?
Yeah, as much as you can.
mom says she loves you.
we send Rebecca a big hug, okay?
we love you, son. good-bye.
were you able to convince him?
it's Jaime. who knows?
you'll talk to Artie in the morning?
Yeah.
honey, who else has the combination for the safe?
nobody.
well, my parents, in case something ever happened.
and Katie.
she likes to try on my jewelry.
it was either that, or she was going to hire a safecracker.
okay.
and frank.
Frank? why frank?
I don't know.
well, in case something ever happens to my parents.
you do understand the concept of a safe?
what difference does it make?
because that's where my gun was.
you don't think...
I- I don't know what I think.
just... just get in bed.
I'm going to stay up a little while longer.
you want accompany?
no. Go to sleep.
be it's all over the papers. Yeah.
it's a small town.
the miami papers.
the new york times web site.
thank you.
well, rich on rich crime, you know.
I'm sure some vanity fair writer's already packed his bags.
papi's got to be a mess.
Yeah, we're all upset.
you don't seem all that perturbed.
what do you want me to do?
wring my hands, and gnash my teeth?
come on, henry, this happened.
this happened?
he's, he's our brother, frank.
let me ask you something. Honestly, do you really think of him as a brother?
I mean, down deep, do you?
I- I'll be honest with you, I don't.
not fully, I don't. I don't think of him like I do you.
if I'm going to go to hell for that, you know.
I can't believe you're saying this.
but you're not saying you disagree?
I disagree.
okay, fair enough.
and it's not just 'cause he's adopted.
it's because he's Alex.
he's, he's aloof.
he's superior.
he's cold.
I don't feel this way.
that he's not all of those things?
a little. But he's my brother.
the same as you.
no, good for you, then. Good for both of you.
can I get...?
shaq's got another on if d-wade stays healthy. Yeah?
well, the celtics are going to be tough, though, right?
Yeah. shaq really wants it, though.
he's going to stick it to Kobe.
so, I wanted to talk to you about something, son.
there's this man named Joe Samuels...
the one who burned down our cane?
allegedly.
well, that's what they say.
he got shot last night. - He dead?
Yeah.
good.
Hey, it's never good
when someone is a victim of a crime.
the police think that I may have had something to do with it.
cool. - no, Artie, it's not cool.
this is serious. come on, listen to me.
and you're going to hear some people talking about this.
uh, some people are going to be saying
that it was me that did it.
I want you to hear me when I say to you that-that it wasn't.
okay? I mean, I was there, but I didn't shoot him.
well, who did?
I- I don't know.
I... I couldn't see.
I wish it was me.
you don't mean that.
look, this is a country of laws.
okay? We live in a country of order and justice.
it's wrong to take the law into your own hands.
always. No exception.
when they find the person who did this,
they're going to put him away in jail,
which is where he belongs.
I need for you to tell me that you understand that.
Artie, really, if you understand it,
say it, because it is important.
I understand.
okay.
but I'm still glad he's dead.
morning.
good morning, Alejandra.
how are you feeling?
as well as can be expected.
you get any sleep?
not a lot, but, uh, I'm fine.
you have a good lawyer?
she seems to think so. - it's good you can joke about it.
Yeah, well, I gotta tell you it's not that funny being mirandized.
Isabel and the children...? - upset.
I'm just trying to keep it in perspective.
which would be...?
that we'll get through it.
you've got huevos, bro.
all right, we've been talking
and the plan here is that
life goes on.
well, that suits me.
we'll see how that works out.
we will get through it.
well, we will or we won't. I mean, alex, let's be
candid here, okay? You're not talking to one of your children.
well, there are things that can be done.
we have resources.
our publicity people can put out
some dirt on Joe Samuels and the things he's done.
God knows there's a long list.
smear the victim. - that can cut both ways, papi.
what are you talking about?
it could seem heavy-handed.
blowback onto the guilty party.
you all think I did it.
my own family, you think I shot him.
didn't you?
of course not. - okay.
I didn't kill him, frank. - Yeah o, I know.
like how you had nothing to do with Quinones?
look at me. I swear on my children!
you ever swear on us, papi?
you ever swear on your kids that you're telling the truth?
I'll answer for him.
never, not once. you know who need to do that? People who lie.
you should leave... - all right, that's enough!
come on, now. if Alex says he did not do it,
that's enough for me.
and it should be enough for anyone in the family.
so who did?
well, that's what I'm going to have to find out.
what do the cops say? Well, - they agree with frank; they think I did it.
all right, there's work to be done.
we'll talk to our publicity people.
well, pop, frank is right about that.
nothing would make me look more guilty
than if we start Smeing Joe.
I think we take the high road.
that's what you wish. It is.
and that we all just get back to work.
hm well, that's a fantasy.
Frank. Come on. come on, the three of you, I mean,
you've got your heads in the sand. you think we're gonna get
one thing accomplished with this hanging over the company's head?
refer all press inquiries to our pr staff.
we're behind you, mijo.
all of us.
Thanks, pop.
Frank.
I understand you have the combination to my home safe.
you didn't happen to give that to anybody, did you?
pathetic
reasonable doubt.
how?
I have no idea. but for starters,
it would help if you'd stop telling the constabulary how much you hated him.
Vince grasso is my oldest friend.
he already knew that.
Yes, but what he knows and what's admissible in court
are two very distinct, different things.
don't you watch television?
I'll start.
I'll save you the trouble. shut the hell up.
you have nothing to say. to no one.
no how. about nothing.
okay.
and you will not be taking the stand.
why not?
you went to the man's house with a gun in your pants.
not the gun that killed him.
that's not reasonable doubt.
that's just confusing.
you hated him
that's in your statement.
you wanted him dead
another generous sprig from your secret garden
that you thought
would be cleansing to share with the people interested
in sending you to the electric chair.
the fine parsing of which precise firearm
achieved the aim that you virtually brag about desiring.
that's something prosecutors wish for
under their pillows at night.
we find the real killer.
you do watch TV.
what?
I mean, who does? Me?
not my job description.
you?
hardly the customary skill set
associated with being ceo of a rum company...
but, well, we live to be proven wrong.
well, I was thinking more along the lines of,
Oh, I don't know, the police?
do you know how many homicides go unsolved in this country?
not really.
forty percent.
okay.
so, when the gendarmes have a live one,
they do this,
and it's "case closed, next case."
40 percent?
go unsolved. Yes, indeedy.
we, if this investigation ends with me, then...
this'll be one of them.
that's something I can work with.
those shirking coppers;
our lazy boys in blue;
your tax dollars not at work.
not looking at other suspects.
you need to come up with a list of plausible alternatives.
I've already got one.
excellent boy.
you did just say a few minutes ago that...
we didn't need to find the killer.
Oh, we don't need to find him.
actually, it's probably better that we don't.
we come up with a whole host of wannabe Joe-killers,
a veritable platoon of murder-minded maybes,
and we make the case that the polizia,
those shiftless incompetents...
simply fell down on the job.
like they do 40% of the time.
just so.
and this'll work?
obfuscation is my business.
it's got a shot.
I've already said it in English and in Spanish.
those are the only two languages I know, okay?
no comment
it's been like this all day.
Yeah, for me as well.
papi, this-this is untenable.
it's the first day; things'll calm down, mijo.
no, p-papi, people eat this stuff up.
you know? between tv and gossip rags
and the blogosphere, I mean, this is not gonna go away.
look, a starlet will be driving the wrong way on the freeway,
baby in her lap, drugs in her purse,
no underwear on, -And all this will be forgotten. -really? Okay.
and then all we have is a company whose ceo
has been indicted for murder- I mean, that's gonna be cake.
a politician once described what you say during a scandal.
you say, "it's not true, it's not true, it's not true,"
it's old news.
so, "it's not true," that's we've settled on?
it's not true.
Hey, guys.
you were just had-mouthing fidel.
I was wondering what I was gonna get you guys for che's birthday.
that butcher.
that foolano takes one good picture,
all these idiots think he's a poet.
my man broke his cherry.
really smoked that Samuels Dude.
I didn't do that.
it's in all the papers.
do you guys do all the things the media says you do?
pretty much.
Yeah.
bad example.
what, you saying he was framed? -no, no, no.
it was o. j. and phil spector- you didn't hear that?
Hey. All right.
I need your help.
we know some good lawyers.
no, I've got a good lawyer- constance hughes?
Oh, that's the chick that gets all those guilty guys off.
and the innocent ones also, okay?
now, there's a guy that I need to find,
used to work for Samuels- Michael Bronson.
he's a private risk consultant.
background in special forces...
eh, Alex, those guys are all ex-delta force
or navy seals.
they talk a lot of smack, and then... and then I kick their ass.
so you think, uh, he did Samuels and put it on you, huh?
es possible.
Oh, you want him? no, no, no, just...
just find him- I want to talk to him.
well, maybe we can all talk to him.
all together.
maybe so.
we'll see what we can do.
I will, uh, owe you.
Yes, you will.
you got other suspects?
maybe so.
you want us to...
this-this other guy, I... I can look into myself.
all right.
drive safe, man.
Yeah.
I'm home.
no basketball practice?
canceled.
Artie, come here.
is everything okay? -uh-huh.
baby, look at me.
Oh, my god, what happened? Nothing.
did you get into a fight?
Artie, talk to me.
Cory Jenks was mouthing off.
mouthing off?
about dad.
he said he was a murderer.
I told him to take it back,
and he wouldn't, so then I clocked him.
he swung back, and we got sent to the principal's office.
are you okay? -kids are saying dad did it.
Yeah, but you know the truth.
Yeah. Can I go to my room now?
I'm getting an ice pack for that eye. -I'm fine!
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Yeah, I'm there now.
I'll get it. Yep.
okay, bye
Hello?
Hello? Frank? -yeah.
Frank.
what?
Hey. There you are.
what are you doing here? You found it.
what? Artie couldn't find his new cell phone.
last time I remembered seeing it was when we were all here fishing.
this kid, he swore up and down that hadn't lede it here.
father knows best. artie's got his own cell?
you know kids.
Jaime's got a new one, so Artie had to have one, too.
Oh. He's a little spoiled, no? what is he, ten?
so what, child-rearing tips now?
whatever.
so, how'd you know I'd be here?
I didn't. I just thought it'd be cool if I came here to look.
I guess I should have cleared it with the harbormaster first, huh?
so, how long you been here? I just got h...
is there a problem?
no. 'course not.
I don't... I don't want to keep you.
no, no.
okay. all right.
I- I'll see you, then.
Yeah.
I'm home.
Artie got into a fight today at school.
over...? Yes.
over this, Alex.
okay, I'll talk to him.
and what exactly are you going to say?
I'm sorry everybody thinks your father is a murderer.
this sucks.
let's go play halo? I might have said madden.
otherwise, uncanny impression, almost eerie.
this isn't funny. no,
it isn't.
but we can't control what others out there are going to say.
what's important is what we know in our hearts is the truth,
and that the truth always comes out.
he's ten.
maybe you can get him to believe that.
so homework's taken a turn for the hipper?
finished it.
all of it?
mostly.
Really?
I heard about the fight.
that hurt much?
not as much as his.
want to talk about it? do I have to?
you don't have to stand up for me.
don't put that on yourself.
people suck.
sometimes they do.
so, no more fighting.
like, never?
let's shoot for that.
I'll try.
try hard.
whatever.
I did have something, but i could forget
just like Jaime's!
Thanks, dad!
I want you to leave it here for dinner.
don't want you bringing it downstairs and fooling with it at the table.
Marcus!
wow, man! Hot night!
off the hook!
your brother should get accused of murder more often.
what? Everyone's ordering death row mojitos.
mojitos with Duque rum.
you're kidding me.
it may be bad for the image out there
in corporate land, but in here,
Duque rum just copped a massive blast of street cred.
it's not your granddaddy's sippin' rum anymore.
it's bad-to-the-bone gangsta fuel.
nice gun.
smart choice, 9mm.
less recoil, 'cause only the idiot cowboys
use the big, heavy pieces, right?
Joe Samuels is coming at you tonight.
so that list of alternate suspects that I mentioned?
Yeah. That's not gonna work.
your funeral.
okay.
well, since client relations
doesn't seem to be your strong suit,
I'm assuming your effectiveness
lies in other areas.
like your family?
very much.
I'm the gal sees to it you get to view them
through something other than two-way glass next 30 years.
if the list is no good, make a new one.
what if I just deliver the killer?
that would be swell, batman, but since this
isn't a comic book, why don't you get me that list?
good-bye.
we might have a line on that bronson guy.
we're getting close, man.
he's clever, though.
Yeah, Mr. special forces.
man, he don't even realize we're there.
what do you mean?
us latinos.
the invisibles,
the underclass.
the guy who parks his car, the waitress, the busboy.
he doesn't even see them. But they talk to Ramon.
I treat 'em with respect.
Oh, yeah, he doesn't even tip good.
that dude's tighter than a mosquito's ass.
we might find him tonight.
you sure you don't want us to...?
Hey, I'm trying to clear my name of a murder,
not contribute to another one.
if you find him, call me.
he's the one?
he's the one.
keep your phone charged.
I called you both in because...
it's pretty clear to me that we have to do something.
about Alex.
I- i know that my motives can be viewed as suspect.
no, no, no, no, mijo, no, no, no... no, papi.
listen. come on. no. cards on the table. okay.
I wanted to be ceo. I was passed over.
I didn't like it. You know, so be it.
this has nothing to do with that.
this is... a successful, prestigious,
multi-million-dollar business organization,
and the head of it has just been accused of murder.
he didn't do it, papi. I understand that,
but that's not what they think out there,
and that's gonna hurt us. badly.
if it hasn't already. Oh, funny thing about that.
Duque rum sales are up
all over south beach.
we're getting some sort of crazy sales bump
from all this notoriety.
papi, I was even thinking,
we could have marketing exploit that.
rum- the drink of pirates.
tie Alex into that as some kind of, uh...
outlaw ceo.
no, enrique.
and we're not asking
Alex to step down either. papi, you've gotta listen...
look, I understand your arguments.
they have merit. They make sense, business sense.
but this isn't just a business.
it's a family business.
what's the look?
what's that? enrique?
nothing.
Frank?
it's just a difference
of opinion that he and I have.
over what?
tell him.
over...
to what extent we consider Alex family.
I'm really sorry you feel that way,
but I'm gonna have to disappoint you yet again.
I consider Alex family, and family sticks together.
there's no honor or virtue in doing so
only when the sun shines.
it's when trouble hits- that's when solidarity matters.
Alex stays.
call him in, please.
Hey, everyone.
you've been deciding whether to fire me.
we've been discussing the future
and we are resolved that it goes unchanged.
resolved unanimously?
resolved definitively.
I appreciate that, pop.
very much.
but I've decided to resign.
what? Yes, pop.
I've considered this
very carefully from every angle.
and I truly believe that this is what is best
for the business, certainly,
but for everyone
especially me.
what are you saying?
this hasn't worked.
you and I keep bumping heads.
Frank's never gotten past
not being named ceo.
it's no one's fault, really.
we're all very strong personalities.
we all want what we want.
and what I want right now
is to get away from all this contention.
I'm gonna go out there and strike out on my own,
make my own way,
my own mistakes, and not feel like
I'm dragging the family into them.
I don't want responsibility
for that anymore.
you never minded.
it's a little too much for me.
just take some time, mijo.
reconsider.
you can't make a decision
under the cloud of a false accusation.
I've taken that time, at your urging,
and this is what's become crystal clear to me, pop.
this is Duque enterprises.
someone named Duque should run it.
I need to go out there on my own
and make my own name for myself. And I will.
so under the circumstances, it is best for the company
that my resignation become effective immediately.
I'll have people come in tomorrow and pack up my office.
I wish you all nothing but the best.
hello.
Oye, we found your Mr. Bronson.
where are you?
I'll be right there.
no, no, you need to stay
as far away as possible.
we're on our way out ourselves.
Ramon, I told you and your guys not to harm him.
didn't get the chance.
we gotta go.
how did...?
shot. I don't know.
Oye, we're not csi, all right?
you asked us to find him, and we found him.
now we gotta go.
Yeah, sure.
it probably don't help you much, him being dead, huh?
probably not.
everything gets my very special surprise wedding gift.
you gonna shoot me right here and now?
don't I get one last request?
911. What is your emergency?
Yes, a man's been shot.
283 brosten lane.
283 brosten.
and I think you should hurry.
hang on.
I'm touched, Vega.
no, I want you to make it.
I want you to make it so you can rot the rest of your miserable life away in the penitentiary for arson and the attempted murder of my son.
afraid you're gonna be disappointed.
at least it wasn't you, Vega.
I can die happy knowing you didn't get that satisfaction.
you...
grasping, jumped up, cuban trash.
I'd like to say "go to hell," Joe.
but I can see that you're already on your way.
turnover and try to relax.
there's a little something to remember me by.
I hope it hurts, Joe.
I hope it hurts real bad.
all the way down.
hands up!
step away from the body. Shots came from over here.
step away from the body, sir.
hands where I can see them. - Hey, I didn't shoot him.
nobody said you did.
but I need those hands in the air.
officer, this happened, like, minutes ago.
shouldn't you guys be out there trying to figure out who did this?
sir, I'm going to ask that you remain silent and please keep your hands high.
what's this?
that would be a gun.
which hasn't been fired because it isn't the murder weapon because I didn't shoot him, someone else did with some other gun from somewhere over there.
and while you are wasting time frisking me he is getting his ass away.
he? You saw the shooter?
Aw, man. No.
Alex, what are you doing here?
Vince...Joe Samuels was shot.
he's dead.
could you tell these guys to go out there and find out who did it?
Yeah, it's okay, I got this.
just search the grounds.
the shots came from somewhere over there.
there was three or four.
four of them.
Alex, why are you here?
because Joe Samuels set fire to our cane nearly killing my son on his wedding day.
sounds like motive to me.
does it?
Oops, well, you got me.
I came here to confront him.
so why the gun?
cause I had no reason to think that he'd be happy to see me.
was he? - He was overjoyed.
keep cracking wise, pal.
it's a good way to make friends. - I don't know, Vince.
I was gonna hold him here, make a citizen's arrest.
shoot him?
I'm not a murderer, okay?
funny. That's not what I hear.
Alex, how'd you get the blood on your shirt?
he, uh, spit on me.
well, now, see, why would i think you'd shoot him?
Yeah, well, you know, we weren't barbecue buddies.
but that's not exactly news around town.
all right, so...
you came to confront him. Tell about that.
I came in, I accused him of the arson.
he, uh...
I don't exactly remember what he said.
we had words, certainly.
words? - Yes, shouted, argued.
is english not your first language? - Alex...
okay.
we argued.
we were yelling.
I don't know, Vince, and then the shots came.
well, then what did you do?
I was actually...
I was afraid for a second because I thought whoever it was might shoot me.
and then I got it back together.
I called 911 for an ambulance, and I guess that's when they called you.
and Samuels?
uh, he was still alive at that point.
I, uh...
I tried to use my jacket to stop his bleeding.
we had more words.
that's when he spit on you.
Yeah.
Yeah, and then he died.
you didn't maybe help him along, did you?
Hey. - Alex, 911 didn't call us.
we got a call a good five minutes before that.
saying some guy fitting your description just shot Joe Samuels.
well, that's obviously the killer trying to cover his tracks.
found this. Recently fired.
I don't know how that got here, man.
that gun was in my safe.
this is your gun, isn't it, Alex?
look at me.
I swear to you... - 9 millimeters.
what do you want to bet it matches that sig.
okay.
okay.
the killer is looking to frame me somehow.
that's pretty obvious. - Alex Vega...
you have the right to remain silent.
you're kidding me, right?
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
the real shooter is getting away right now.
you have the right to speak to an attorney, the right to have an attorney present come on, Vince. During any questioning.
you know I didn't kill him.
if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you.
do you understand these rights?
you're making a mistake.
do you understand?
well, you can use my desk.
just dial nine.
Hello?
it's me. - Alex, where are you?
I'm at the police station with Vince Grasso.
Joe Samuels was shot.
Oh, my god.
is he...? - He's dead.
What?!
what are you doing at the police station? - Honey...
I need for you to call moises greenberg.
needs to call the best criminal attorney he knows.
Oh, my god.
wake whoever it is up if he's asleep and have him come down here right away.
they think you did it?
this is a misunderstanding that I'm going to clear up.
but, uh...
meanwhile, I need for you to do this for me. Okay?
okay. - I love you.
I love you, too.
okay.
come on, let's go talk.
go ahead, have a seat.
Hey, can I get you something?
let's just get through this please.
this is gonna take as long as it takes.
you should plan on getting thirsty.
I'll risk it.
okay.
what was your relationship with Joe Samuels?
you know what it was.
we were neighbors.
friendly neighbors?
not particularly.
enemies?
I don't know, he had men kidnap and kill my adopted sister, threaten my own boy, burned the family sugar cane, almost resulting in the death of my other son.
would you call that enemies?
enough to make you want to kill him?
Oh, I wanted to, make no mistake.
but I didn't.
you say that like you almost regret it.
what was your gun doing at the scene, alex?
I have no idea.
and you know what, you don't either.
because you're wasting this time talking to the man that did not do this.
Oh, why don't we cut the crap?
you've been in here before accused of another murder of a man you alleged killed your sister.
alleged? - And we had to let you go.
because I had nothing to do with that.
because we couldn't prove you did.
what I said.
no, you said you had nothing to do with it, which we could not prove was untrue.
but which we did not for one second believe.
and we don't believe you now.
we don't?
I don't.
you calling me a liar?
you don't want me to call you a liar, Alex, you're gonna have to stop lying to me.
you and the children have to come here and sleep tonight.
all right.
all right, but you, uh...
you call if you hear anything else.
love you.
okay, bye.
motive, opportunity, your gun...
that we all know ballistics is gonna show was the murder weapon.
see, this is what we in the law enforcement game call "open and shut.
killed one family member, threatened others.
burned down your land.
crime of passion.
justifiable homicide.
no one's saying you're getting off, but plead this down to manslaughter.
I don't know, a sympathetic jury.
just make sure you pick one's got kids.
thanks for that jury selection insight, detective.
you don't mind if I don't deem it billable.
I'm Mr. Vega's attorney, and this conversation is over.
and there will be no subsequent sequels or reprises, casual or otherwise, without myself being present.
you pass on the street, you don't so much as nod hello without first calling, and waiting for me.
you dream of my client, you make damn sure you also conjure this face in your slumbers.
are we clear?
great. Constance hughes. Nice to meet you.
I've arranged bail. You're free to go.
pleasure, detectives.
thanks for coming.
no need for gratitude. You're paying me a fortune.
I didn't do it.
I assume that's what we're going with.
no, I mean really. I didn't.
I don't care. Your wife's waiting.
did you do this?
you know I didn't do this.
I don't know.
that's why I'm asking.
okay, stop.
stop, stop, stop.
stop.
listen.
I will never lie to you, mislead you, shade, or conceal the truth from you ever again.
as long as we both live on this earth.
I did not shoot Joe Samuels.
then this will be fine.
Jaime, under no circumstances are you to fly home.
you're on your honeymoon.
I just wanted to call and let you know, in case I made the news.
your mom is fine; I'm fine.
Katie is, uh, still going to go to new york tomorrow with that, uh, model U. N.Group.
so, you know, life goes on as normal.
Yeah.
I just want you to put this out of your head, okay?
Yeah, as much as you can.
mom says she loves you.
we send rebecca a big hug, okay?
we love you, son. Good-bye.
were you able to convince him?
it's Jaime. Who knows?
you'll talk to Artie in the morning?
Yeah.
honey, who else has the combination for the safe?
nobody.
well, my parents, in case something ever happened.
and Katie.
she likes to try on my jewelry.
it was either that, or she was going to hire a safecracker.
okay.
and frank.
Frank? Why frank?
I don't know.
well, in case something ever happens to my parents.
you do understand the concept of a safe?
what difference does it make?
because that's where my gun was.
you don't think... - I-I don't know what I think.
just...
just get in bed. - I'm going to stay up a little while longer.
you want company?
no. Go to sleep.
it's all over the papers.
it's a small town.
the Miami papers.
the new york times web site.
thank you.
well, rich on rich crime, you know.
I'm sure some vanity fair writer's already packed his bags.
Papa's got to be a mess.
Yeah, we're all upset.
you don't seem all that perturbed.
what do you want me to do?
wring my hands, and gnash my teeth?
come on, henry, this happened.
"this happened"?
he's, he's our brother, frank.
let me ask you something.
honestly, do you really think of him as a brother?
I mean, down deep, do you?
I-I'll be honest with you, I don't.
not fully, I don't.
I don't think of him like I do you.
if I'm going to go to hell for that, you know.
I can't believe you're saying this.
but you're not saying you disagree?
I disagree.
okay, fair enough.
and it's not just 'cause he's adopted.
it's because he's Alex. He's, he's aloof.
he's superior.
he's cold.
I don't feel this way.
that he's not all of those things?
a little.
but he's my brother.
the same as you. - No, good for you, then.
good for both of you.
can I get...?
shaq's got another on if d-wade stays healthy.
yeah? Well, the Celtics are going to be tough, though, right?
Yeah. Shaq really wants it, though.
he's going to stick it to Kobe.
so, I wanted to talk to you about something, son.
there's this man named Joe Samuels...
the one who burned down our cane?
allegedly.
well, that's what they say.
he got shot last night.
he dead?
Yeah.
good.
Hey, it's never good when someone is a victim of a crime.
the police think that I may have had something to do with it.
cool. - No, Artie, it's not cool. This is serious.
come on, listen to me.
and you're going to hear some people talking about this.
uh, some people are going to be saying that it was me that did it.
I want you to hear me when I say to you that-which it wasn't.
okay? I mean, I was there, but I didn't shoot him.
well, who did?
I-I don't know. I...
I couldn't see.
I wish it was me.
hey...
you don't mean that.
look, this is a country of laws. Okay?
we live in a country of order and justice.
it's wrong to take the law into your own hands.
always. No exception.
when they find the person who did this, they're going to put him away in jail, which is where he belongs.
I need for you to tell me that you understand that.
Artie, really, if you understand it, say it, because it is important.
I understand.
okay.
but I'm still glad he's dead.
morning.
good morning, Alejandro.
how are you feeling?
as well as can be expected.
you get any sleep? - Not a lot, but, uh, I'm fine.
you have a good lawyer?
she seems to think so.
it's good you can joke about it.
Yeah, well, I gotta tell you it's not that fny unbeing mirandized.
Isabel and the children...?
upset.
I'm just trying to keep it in perspective.
which would be...?
that we'll get through it.
you've got huevos, bro.
all right, we've been talking and the plan here is that life goes on.
well, that suits me.
we'll see how that works out.
we will get through it.
well, we will or we won't.
I mean, Alex, let's be candid here, okay?
you're not talking to one of your children.
well, there are things that can be done. We have resources.
our publicity people can put out some dirt on Joe Samuels and the things he's done.
God knows there's a long list.
smear the victim. - That can cut both ways, papi.
what are you talking about?
it could seem heavy-handed.
blowback onto the guilty party.
you all think I did it.
my own family, you think I shot him.
didn't you? - Of course not.
okay. - I didn't kill him, frank.
yeah... no, I know.
look at me. I swear on my children!
you ever swear on us, papi?
you ever swear on your kids that you're telling the truth?
I'll answer for him.
never, not once.
you know who need to do that?
people who lie. - You should leave...
all right, that's enough!
if Alex says he did not do it, that's enough for me.
and it should be enough for anyone in the family.
so who did?
well, that's what I'm going to have to find out.
what do the cops say?
well, they agree with frank; they think I did it.
all right, there's work to be done.
we'll talk to our publicity people.
well, pop, frank is right about that.
nothing would make me look more guilty than if we start Smeing Joe.
I think we take the high road.
all right, if that's what you wish. - It is.
and that we all just get back to work.
well, that's a fantasy.
Frank. - Come on.
come on, the three of you, I mean, you've got your heads in the sand.
you think we're gonna get one thing accomplished with this hanging over the company's head?
refer all press inquiries to our pr staff.
we're behind you, Mijo.
all of us.
Thanks, pop.
I understand you have the combination to my home safe.
you didn't happen to give that to anybody, did you?
pathetic.
reasonable doubt.
how?
I have no idea.
but for starters, it would help if you'd stop telling the constabulary how much you hated him.
Vince grasso is my oldest friend.
he already knew that.
Yes, but what he knows and what's admissible in court are two very distinct, different things.
don't you watch television?
I'll start.
I'll save you the trouble.
shut the hell up.
you have nothing to say.
to no one.
no how.
about nothing.
okay. - And you will not be taking the stand.
why not?
you went to the man's house with a gun in your pants.
not the gun that killed him.
that's not reasonable doubt.
that's just confusing.
you hated him... that's in your statement.
you wanted him dead... another generous sprig from your secret garden that you thought would be cleansing to share with the people interested in sending you to the electric chair.
the fine parsing of which precise firearm achieved the aim that you virtually brag about desiring.
that's something prosecutors wish for under their pillows at night.
we find the real killer.
you do watch TV.
what? - I mean, who does? Me?
not my job description. You?
hardly the customary skill set associated with being ceo of a rum company...
but, well, we live to be proven wrong.
well, I was thinking more along the lines of, oh, I don't know, the police?
do you know how many homicides go unsolved in this country?
not really.
forty percent.
okay.
so, when the gendarmes have a live one, they do this, and it's "case closed, next case."
40 percent? - Go unsolved.
Yes, indeedy.
we, if this investigation ends with me, then...
this'll be one of them.
that's something I can work with.
those shirking coppers; our lazy boys in blue;
your tax dollars not at work.
not looking at other suspects.
you need to come up with a list of plausible alternavetis.
I've already got one.
excellent boy.
you did just say a few minutes ago that...
we didn't need to find the killer.
Oh, we don't need to find him.
actually, it's probably better that we don't.
we come up with a whole host of wannabe Joe-killers, a veritable platoon of murder-minded maybes, and we make the case that the polizia, those shiftless incompetents...
simply fell down on the job.
like they do 40% of the time.
just so.
and this'll work?
obfuscation is my business.
it's got a shot.
I've already said it in english and in spanish.
those are the only two languages I know, okay?
no comment.
it's been like this all day.
Yeah, for me as well.
papi, this-this is untenable.
it's the first day; things will calm down, Mijo.
no, p-papi, people eat this stuff up.
you know? Between TV and gossip rags and the blogosphere,
I mean, this is not gonna go away.
look, a starlet will be driving the wrong way on the freeway, baby in her lap, drugs in her purse, no underwear on, and all this will be forgotten.
Really? Okay.
and then all we have is a company whose ceo has been indicted for murder...
I mean, that's gonna be cake.
a politician once described what you say during a scandal.
you say,"it's not true, it's not true, it's not true, it's old news."
So,"it's not true," that's we've settled on?
it's not true.
we were just bad-mouthing Fidel
I was wondering what i was gonna get you guys for Che's birthday.
that butcher.
that Fulano takes one good picture, all these idiots think he's a poet.
my man broke his cherry.
really smoked that Samuels dude.
I didn't do that.
it's in all the papers.
do you guys do all the things the media says you do?
pretty much.
bad example.
what, you saying he was framed? - No, no, no.
it was O. J. and Phil spector... you didn't hear that?
Hey.
all right. - I need your help.
we know some good lawyers.
no, I've got a good lawyer... constance hughes?
Oh, that's the chick that gets all those guilty guys off.
and the innocent ones also, okay?
now, there's a guy that I need to find, used to work for Samuels... Michael Bronson.
he's a private risk consultant.
background in special forces...
eh, Alex, those guys are all ex-delta force or navy seals.
they talk a lot of smack, and then...
and then I kick their ass.
so you think, uh, he did Samuels and put it on you, huh?
es possible.
Oh, you want him?
no, no, no, just...just find him...
I want to talk to him.
well, maybe we can all talk to him.
all together.
maybe so.
we'll see what we can do.
bueno.
I will, uh, owe you.
Yes, you will.
you got other suspects?
maybe so.
you want us to...
this-this other guy, I...
I can look into myself.
all right.
drive safe, man. - Yeah.
I'm home.
no basketball practice?
canceled.
Artie, come here.
is everything okay?
Uh-huh.
baby, look at me.
Oh, my god, what happened?
nothing.
did you get into a fight?
Artie, talk to me.
Cory Jenks was mouthing off.
mouthing off?
about dad.
he said he was a murderer.
I told him to take it back, and he wouldn't, so then I clocked him.
he swung back, and we got sent to the principal's office.
are you okay?
kids are saying dad did it.
Yeah, but you know the truth.
Yeah. Can I go to my room now?
I'm getting an ice pack for that eye.
I'm fine!
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Yeah, I'm there now.
I'll get it. ok ,bye, hello?
Hello? Frank?
Yeah.
what?
Hey. There you are.
what are you doing here?
you found it. - What?
Artie couldn't find his new cell phone.
last time I remembered seeing it was when we were all here fishing.
this kid, he swore up and down that he hadn't left it here.
father knows best.
Artie's got his own cell?
you know kids.
Jaime's got a new one, so Artie had to have one, too.
Oh. He's a little spoiled, no?
what is he, ten?
so what, child-rearing tips now?
whatever.
so, how'd you know I'd be here?
I didn't. I just thought it'd be cool if I came here to look.
I guess I should have cleared it with the harbormaster first, huh?
so, how long you been here?
I just got H...
is there a problem?
no. Course not.
I don't...
I don't want to keep you. - No, no.
okay. All right.
I-I'll see you, then. - Yeah.
I'm home.
Artie got into a fight today at school.
over...? - Yes.
over this, Alex.
okay, I'll talk to him.
and what exactly are you going to say?
I'm sorry everybody thinks your father is a murderer.
this sucks. Let's go play halo"?
I might have said madden.
otherwise, uncanny impression, almost eerie.
this isn't funny.
no, it isn't.
but we can't control what others out there are going to say.
what's important is what we know in our hearts is the truth, and that the truth always comes out.
he's ten.
maybe you can get him to believe that.
so homework's taken a turn for the hipper?
finished it.
all of it?
mostly.
Really?
I heard about the fight.
that hurt much?
not as much as his.
want to talk about it?
do I have to?
you don't have to stand up for me.
don't put that on yourself.
people are gonna say things, and it won't be the last time.
people suck.
sometimes they do.
so, no more fighting.
like, never?
let's shoot for that.
I'll try.
try hard.
whatever.
I did have something, but I could forget.
Oh, cool!
just like Jaime's!
Thanks, dad!
I want you to leave it here for dinner.
don't want you bringing it downstairs and fooling with it at the table.
Hey!
yo!
wow, man!
hot night!
off the hook!
your brother should get accused of murder more often.
what?
everyone's ordering death row mojitos.
mojitos with Duque Rum.
you're kidding me.
it may be bad for the image out there in corporate land, but in here, Duque Rum just copped a massive blast of street cred.
it's not your granddaddy's Sippin' rum anymore.
it's bad-to-the-bone gangsta fuel.
nice gun.
smart choice, 9mm.
less Recoil, 'cause only the idiot cowboys use the big, heavy pieces, right?
Joe Samuels is coming at you tonight.
so that list of alternate suspects that I mentioned?
Yeah.
that's not gonna work.
your funeral.
okay.
well, since client relations doesn't seem to be your strong suit,
I'm assuming your effectiveness lies in other areas.
like your family?
very much.
I'm the gal sees to it you get to view them through something other than two-way glass next 30 years.
if the list is no good, make a new one.
what if I just deliver the killer?
that would be swell, batman, but since this isn't a comic book, why don't you get me that list?
good-bye.
we might have a lineman Bronson guy.
we're getting close, man.
he's clever, though.
Yeah, Mr. Special forces.
man, he doesn't even realize we're there.
what do you mean?
us Latinos.
the invisibles, the underclass.
the guy whs parko his car, the waitress, the busboy.
he doesn't even see them. - But they talk to Ramon.
I treat 'em with respect.
Oh, yeah, he don't even tip good.
that dude's tighter than a mosquito's ass.
we might find him tonight.
you sure you don't want us to...
Hey, I'm trying to clear my name of a murder, not contribute to another one.
if you find him, call me.
he's the one?
he's the one.
keep your phone charged.
I called you both in because...
it's pretty clear to me that we have to do something.
about Alex.
I-I know that my motives can be viewed as suspect.
no, no, no, no, Mijo, no, no, no...
no, Papi. Listen. Come on. No.
cards on the table. Okay.
I wanted to be ceo.
I was passed over.
I didn't like it. You know, so be it.
this has nothing to do with that.
this is...
a successful, prestigious, multi-million-dollar business organization, and the head of it has just been accused of murder.
he didn't do it, papi.
I understand that, but that's not what they think out there, and that's gonna hurt us.
badly.
if it hasn't already.
Oh, funny thing about that.
Duque rum sales are up all over south beach.
we're getting some sort of crazy sales bump from all this notoriety.
papi, I was even thinking, we could have marketing exploit that.
rum... the drink of pirates.
tie alex into that as some kind of, uh...
outlaw ceo.
no, enrique.
and we're not asking Alex to step down either.
papi, you've gotta listen... - look, I understand your arguments.
they have merit. They make sense, business sense.
but this isn't just a business.
it's a family business.
what's the look? What's that?
nothing. - Frank?
it's just a difference of opinion that he and I have.
over what?
tell him.
over...
to what extent we consider Alex family.
I'm really sorry you feel that way, but I'm gonna have to disappoint you yet again.
I consider Alex family, anlyfamid sticks together.
there's no honor or virtue in doing so only when the sun shines.
it's when trouble hits... that's when solidarity matters.
Alex stays.
call him in, please.
Hey, everyone.
you've been deciding whether to fire me.
we've been discussing the future and we are resolved that it goes unchanged.
resolved unanimously?
resolved definitively.
I appreciate that, pop.
very much.
but I've decided to resign.
what?
Yes, pop.
I've considered this very carefully from every angle.
and I truly believe that this is what is best...
for the business, certainly, but for everyone... especially me.
what are you saying?
this hasn't worked.
you and I keep bumping heads.
Frank's never gotten past not being named ceo.
it's no one's fault, really.
we're all very strong personalities.
we all want what we want.
and what I want right now is to get away from all this contention.
I'm gonna go out there and strike out on my own, make my own way, my own mistakes, and not feel like I'm dragging the family into them.
I don't want responsibility for that anymore.
you never minded. It's a little too much for me.
just take some time, Mijo.
reconsider.
you can't make a decision under the cloud of a false accusation.
I've taken that time, at your urging, and this is what's become crystal clear to me, pop.
this is Duque enterprises.
someone named Duque should run it.
I need to go out there on my own and make my own name for myself.
and I will.
so under the circumstances, it is best for the company that my resignation become effective immediately.
I'll have people come in tomorrow and pack up my office.
I wish you all nothing but the best.
hello.
Oye, we found your Mr. Bronson.
where are you? I'll be right there.
no, no, you need to stay as far away as possible.
we're on our way out ourselves.
Ramon, I told you and your guys not to harm him.
didn't get the chance.
we gotta go.
how did...?
shot. I don't know.
Oye, we're not csi, all right?
you asked us to find him, and we found him.
now we gotta go.
Yeah, sure.
it probably doesn't help you much, him being dead, huh?
probably not.
behold the Usher.
a dark heart dwells where branches meet.
anointed dagger...
plunge thee deep!
accept your fate.
scudder.
Henry Scudder, right?
my name is Stroud, Varlyn Stroud.
I got a friend who's just dying to meet you.
scudder!
scudder?
something terrible bad.
what's Scudder got to do with it?
have you seen him?
no, I sure heard you yelling.
I got to stop him!
Hawkins!
Hey.
I got an idea.
well.
holy cats, gentlemen! Holy cats!
it looks like Miss Lulu is out of control tonight!
boys, I would not be surprised if she might be persuaded to do her famous Bulgarian muscle dance!
where the hell is Libby? - I haven't seen her yet.
what's that, Miss Lulu? No, not the red-light show!
not the red-light show!
that's been banned in seven-- No, eight states!
and that's just on this side of the Mississippi!
that's four double-trots in a row.
I'm dying!
gentlemen, yes, indeedy. Yes, indeedy.
now if you'll just step right on through to the next tent here, where Miss Lulu will reveal her most intimate of secrets!
no.
no.
what happened?
you don't remember?
we were listening to the radio and I must've fainted.
and then?
nothing.
it seems you had one of your spells.
spells?
it was nothing, Alexsei.
you just need some rest, that's all.
go to sleep now.
thank you, Eleanor.
miss Iris?
did you see?
did I see what?
the devil in him,
I saw the devil.
shame on you, Eleanor.
you know Brother Justin is a man of God.
Where's my money?
Jesus-- Hey, Bud...
Hey.
I was hoping you would stop by.
is that a fact?
look, I know Damascus ain't exactly on the circuit
what circuit?
you people move around like a pack of drunk monkeys.
I thought we agreed that you were going to tell me
now, I know I was supposed to leave word at the last town we were at, but the thing is
you were hoping you could duck me. - No, no
trouble here?
Oh hell, Rita! Jeez! - Shut up.
you wanna slap him around, have at it.
but if you want your dough, you'd best come on in here and talk to me.
it's your choice.
she was just kidding about slapping me around.
goddamn Scudder.
he finally did it.
he didn't do nothing.
it was me. I did it.
not Scudder.
Why?
you said so yourself, remember?
he had to die.
and he had to make sure I was the one who killed him.
What're you saying? - I'm saying, all those years, he wasn't trying to find Scudder.
he was just trying to keep tabs on him.
jut like he kept tabs on me.
Lodz, Ruthie, that was a test.
that was a dry run to make sure I had it in me.
once he knew for sure I did, all he had to do was put the pieces in place.
him, Scudder, me, all of us, here in this trailer.
he knew I couldn't kill him except to save my father.
so the simple matter is...
hell, You can even run it over with your automobile,
but you can't get blood out of it.
I'm sure this isn't the first time that somebody hasn't been able to pay up.
maybe we can work something out.
maybe.
what do you say to 10% of the gate?
just until we get ourselves squared up.
hmm. What about the vig?
Oh, Bud, you don't have to keep your meter running overtime on account of us.
maybe for you.
as for me, the interest you're looking for down there got shot off in a barley field outside of Avignon.
100 Bucks!
cold and hard and in my hand at the end of each week, every week, until you've paid off the principal, plus the vig.
miss a payment, we'll see if I can't make a stone bleed.
I wager I can.
so you're saying he set the whole thing up?
by the hand of the Prince...
the Prophet dies.
the Prince, that's me.
management was the Prophet.
it's all in this book.
he needed me to kill him.
Why?
when I killed him, everything he was, everything he knew, everything he believed, he gave it to me.
he had to.
he knew that was the only chance I had against the Usher.
the Usher. - Alexsei Belyakov.
his son.
that's bullshit! Nothing but lies.
they ain't lies! You knew him.
you knew the way he did things.
you're damn right I did!
and you killed him, you dumb hick son of a bitch!
Hey, Sofie.
open up. It's me.
Hey, Sof.
what the hell do you want?
Where's Sofie? - I don't know.
that can't be.
well, it is.
do you know where she went?
has she told anybody?
left a note? - Not a word.
just pfft, Scramski.
no, she wouldn't do that.
not after
after what, loverboy?
Hey. Whatcha got?
Crowe residence.
I need to talk to Brother Justin.
he's indisposed right now. - How long is he going to be indisposed?
I don't know how long-- - Oh, come on.
I'm sorry. - Is that McNaughton again?
it's that man-- Stroud.
where are you?
Nebraska.
I've managed to find our friend.
scudder?
Uh-huh. He's with me right now.
when will you be here? - Two, three days, tops.
are you all right?
Oh yeah, I'm fine.
fit as a fiddle.
can I help you?
thank you, friend. But I think I'll help myself.
hand over the cash box.
give me the damn money, hayseed!
Ooh. That's right.
that's right.
praise the Lord!
Hey!
Slap-happy!
looks like we got ourselves a ragtop.
west.
west.
you're awake.
I brought you some joe.
Thanks. - Yeah.
Yeah! Ain't that something?
well, I better, uh... Better hop to it.
I don't want to keep the boys waiting.
Yeah, me too. I mean, you know.
Yeah.
what the hell are you doing in there?
are you crackers?
shacking up with that gimp for everybody and his brothers to see?
I was just-- - I'll tell you what you was just!
you're just breaking your daddy's heart, that's what you was just!
good Lord, what did I raise!
you ain't too old I can't take a switch to you!
Oh yeah? Maybe I'm too married!
him?
Yeah, him.
ain't you gonna congratulate me?
haven't you ever heard of knocking?
I got it figured out!
got what figured out?
we got to pack it up and head West.
I felt him out there. - Is that a fact?
Yep! We can't waste no time, neither.
he got a head start on us.
but if we hustle out now, we might be able to catch up!
who the hell is "He"? - The bald fella!
he's connected to the Usher somehow. I know it!
he can lead us right to him, but we got to get moving now!
if you're so powerful, you bring him back.
What'd you do with him?
who?
management!
Oh, Jesus.
we ain't got time for this now! Didn't you hear what I said?
where the hell is he?
he
he ascended.
ascended? - Yeah.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
he went up to
I don't know, to heaven.
I want you out of here, God damn it.
I need your help. - You killed him, damn it!
look at what you killed, you ignorant hayseed!
goddamn rube!
don't you see what he was?
I know exactly what he was, 'cause that's what I am!
well, there was one thing he was that you ain't
I'll tell you what, Prince.
I'll give you all the help you need...
as soon as you bring him back.
I'm flattered, Brother Justin, I really I am.
but I doubt my name will pass muster with the nomination committee.
we need men like you in Washington, Mr. Templeton.
ty divine is a socialist and a degenerate.
an atheist.
he's also an incumbent.
the man's untouchable.
well, Val, I think you're selling yourself a little short there.
Oh, Ned. The fix has been in on this district since they redrew the boundaries in the last census.
Mr. Templeton, do you have any idea how many people listen to my brother every week?
thousands. - Hundreds of thousands.
we're planning a special candlelight service for next sunday evening,
I would very much like you to be a keynote speaker.
it takes more than one speech to win an election.
it takes organization.
it takes money.
money is no problem.
it takes manpower-- People walking door to door.
Yes, of course it does.
gentlemen, please.
that census you mentioned a moment ago, that was for 1930, was it not?
Yes, it was.
did it happen to record the number of registered voters, in the district?
Yes, sir, that it did.
and do you happen to recall that number, Mr. Templeton?
there's more than 3 times that number living here now.
over 17, 000 souls.
we provide them food, shelter, blankets, toys for their children, medicine for their sick and elderly.
now I wonder, who do you suppose they will vote for come November?
anybody you tell them to.
that's right.
No!
those are mine!
this is ridiculous.
you are too young to get married to Jones, or to anyone.
daddy! - She's right, baby.
well, it's too late.
we already done it.
we'll get it annulled.
we ain't catholic, mama.
he's more than twice your age!
this has got to be against some law. - I don't know, honey.
Felix, do something!
ain't nothing to be done.
you are useless!
I'm sure he sweet-talked you, baby.
he's real good at that.
he's got a wicked silver tongue and he knows how to make a woman feel good.
you're just jealous, mama.
jealous?
you're my daughter.
because he wants me and not you.
is that why you did this, girl?
maybe I love him!
and he loves me.
so why shouldn't we get married then?
that ain't enough. - Well, it's enough for me.
Bye, daddy.
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.
you're gonna have to find someone else to do the kootch.
Jonesy don't want me dancing no more.
Oh, crap.
ain't nothing to be done.
two rides. Then take them off.
What're you doing?
I mean why aren't you inside working?
Ruthie!
come one, come all. Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, see Rollo the rubberboy.
damn it.
get over here!
I want you turning the tip on the wrassling show.
shut down that single-o and move Rollo over to ten-in-one.
he ain't gonna be happy. - Yeah?
tell him it comes straight down from Management.
Ruthie?
what the hell's going on?
I can't.
can't what?
what's the matter? - I can't go out there.
why not?
you sick or something?
you remember that night I told you I had a date with Skeeter Lewis?
yeah? - Well, I did!
I saw him.
Ruthie, Skeeter Lewis is-- - Dead, I know!
but I'm telling you I saw him.
and a whole lot of others since.
dead folks.
are you saying you've got the Sight?
at least since I got snakebit, I do.
we could work something up.
Oh, for Pete's sake, Samson!
I'm not interested in working up an act! I just want it to stop!
I thought I was doing better.
I haven't seen nothing for a while.
then last night...
what happened? - I saw Scudder.
hack Scudder?
stumbling through the midway like a bourbon street rummy.
and this other one, he come and he shove him into a car.
a car!
they got cars!
Ruthie, Hack Scudder isn't dead.
he was here last night.
that was him you saw.
it was?
thank God.
Ruthie, I need you to tell me about that fella you seen, the one throwing Hack in the car, right down to the quick.
let's go.
hey there, Jones!
Hey.
thought I'd come by and say congratulations.
Thanks.
Oh, looks like you got a customer.
take it over. - You got it, Jonesy.
it looks like you're part of the family now.
Yeah, I suppose.
you know, I understand you don't like Libby's line of work.
Yeah. Sorry.
nothing to be sorry about. That's to be expected.
no, it takes, uh,
I tell you it takes a certain kind of man.
fortitude. You know?
it's not easy turning your wife out every night and expecting her to come back.
Yeah, I'll bet. - You know I was thinking
and Rita Sue and I were thinking it would be awful nice if all four of us, you and me and Libby, - and, uh... - Rita Sue.
Yeah, yeah, and Rita Sue-- anyhow,
we should all get together, have a family supper.
what do say? About 8: 00, behind the kootch?
sure, I guess.
that would be great! That would be fantastic!
good. Okay, then.
Oh. You know,
Hey, Jones, could you do me a favor?
don't go calling Rita Sue "Mother.
at least not just yet.
I hadn't planned on it.
one lump or two?
you didn't have to go through this much trouble.
two.
I feel better already.
that's good.
you have any more...
fits?
not that I remember.
you know, you could be having them and not be remembering.
I mean, like, when you're alone and there's nobody around to observe any peculiar behavior.
well, that ain't exactly comforting, is it?
Oh, I know. I know.
it's downright terrifying.
you could get up and wander out into the road, and get runned over by a bus or something.
maybe you need someone to stay with you, day and night.
Oh, Ruthie...
Ruthie, I
I'm in heaven And the cares that hung around me Through the week...
Lincoln Highway.
seem to vanish like A gambler's lucky streak When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek...
Jesus! Crazy fathead!
Jeepers.
and then what happened? - Nothing.
there was just the pain.
may I see?
my flesh is burned and scarred.
good Lord.
what does it mean?
your enemy has received his boon.
no. - Yes.
but what concerns me more is this business you mentioned with the knife.
anointed dagger, plunge thee deep!
anointed? - Infused with Avataric blood.
if he has it in his possession, along with his boon, he not only has the strength, but the means to destroy you.
have you located Scudder?
Yes. He's on his way.
when he arrives, call me.
he and I have some unfinished business.
perhaps.
please?
perhaps.
hell, Lib, it wasn't like I could just put him off.
why not? - He come to me.
it would have looked bad.
come on, Lib. It's just supper.
it ain't just supper.
they're trying to work something.
why you got to be so suspicious?
come on.
it'll be okay.
the sa... The...
so...
you all thinking about settling down?
maybe buying a little bungalow?
never really talked about it.
kids?
haven't really talked about that neither.
my oh my, well...
you two lovebirds haven't done much talking at all, have you?
you know, it sure is a shame.
you know, it'd be nice if you two could get off to a nice start.
a little extra money, whatnot. - Forget it, daddy.
well, no. I'm just saying that
so you wanna tell us what's wrong with being married to a dancer?
it ain't the dancing I got truck with.
Oh no. I'm sure it's just the fucking part that's got your knickers in a bunch.
Rita. - Don't you "Rita" me!
this is a family problem, and a six-bit ring don't make him family!
I ain't gonna listen to this.
you sit the hell down!
we got a problem here, Cowboy.
stumpy has dug himself a hole to the tune of $833.
that ain't my problem. - Oh yeah, it is.
because just what are you gonna say to your blushing little bride here, when the gorilla he owes it to carves her daddy up like a ripe tom-turkey?
that ain't fair. He's the one who got hisself into it.
I don't see why Libby should have to bail him out.
because we're family, and families rise up together, and they fall down together. But you wouldn't know anything about that
Mr. All-By-Your-Damn-self!
I'm not gonna have my crew watching my wife dancing naked for a nickel a throw, and that's it!
come on. - You can't tell me what to do!
you're damn right!
and you can't neither!
y'all make me sick, the bunch of you.
talking about me like I'm not even a person, like I'm some kind of livestock you can buy and sell and trade.
well it ain't that way, damn it!
honey, we never said you're-- - Shut up!
I'm gonna dance the kootch.
Libby-- - Just until we pay off what he owes.
and then I am retired permanent.
and no blow-offs and no more turning tricks.
