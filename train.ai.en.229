stukeley wrote that newton told him the notion of gravity popped into the scientist's mind as he was sitting in the same situation.
Stukeley's account on the royal society's web site joins notes from newton's 17th-century scientific rival robert hooke-documents that were lost for several hundred years before their recent discovery in a house in england.
Stukeley's work was not published until 1752, a quarter-century after newton died at the age of 84, so it's possible that his recollection of newton's tale veers somewhat from the truth.
